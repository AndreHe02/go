This feels a bit small. C6 leaves room for invasion, but it is easy to deal with. After White 16 in the regular game, white has gained a lot of territory on the bottom and given up very little on the side.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[co];B[em];W[fp]TR[bj][bm]C[----------
B7/B10 for white very playable, both undermine black's group very well, something to be wary of.]
;B[jp];W[iq];B[jq];W[hq];B[eo]C[----------
Be careful about peeps like this. White is already solid, but this removes the aji of something like E3 for only a little gain.]

(;B[pp]C[Up to this point I felt I was holding my own, although I suspect part of the reason was because some of my oppponent's moves were not strong. But I wasn't sure of the proper response to white's next move :  Q7 (move 38).

----------
P6 in response to the initial cut solves your problem, but it is still possible to rope white in with a small sacrifice at move 40.]

Now is your best chance to invade, particularly if you can come out of it with sente. White's become strong on the top and the moves along the center make matters worse.]

The usual joseki doesn't work so well here, something different is called for. It's very possible to live but if white plays right this gets black at best, a ko. (See alternate 101 for variations.)]

Best here is probably to block at R14 and cut off white's room to wriggle. The cut is null because R14 makes it a ladder.]

;W[qi]C[----------
Same trick here, push out to S11 and white can no longer push in to cut, and while you'll have to connect this one after, it prevents white from linking up in any way.]

(;B[rh];W[ri];B[si];W[qj]C[----------
From here your best bet becomes to squeeze white to keep some of this group under wraps as best you can.]

----------
N17 and white's slipup not connecting there was definitely the game. S12 I think was the nail in the coffin for black before that, though. White easily leads from there until the Black's big capture up top. Be careful about fancy looking moves like S12 in the future. It looks powerful, but in practice the much simpler moves often save the day; in this case, just pushing under.

All in all, good game, work on tesuji and life and death. Your fuseki was all right, it was mostly reading mistakes in midgame and on like your invasion into the top left and white's on the right that went (or at least had the potential to go) very wrong. Good luck in the future, hope some of this helpful to you!
