;B[qf]C[AB: Very unusual first move.];W[pc];B[qc]LB[pp:A]C[
 regginos 8k*: hello from Cyprus!

AB: Taking a second corner (e.g. at 'A') would be good.];W[qd]
;B[pd];W[rc];B[qb];W[pe];B[od];W[qe];B[rb];W[oe];B[nd]LB[oc:A]
C[AB: I'm not a joseki-expert, but 'A' looks good to me. Your move is probably ok, too.]
;W[dc];B[ph]C[AB: Now this is definitely the first mistake. It's overly aggressive, taking an empty corner would be better.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[pf];B[qh];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf]TR[pg][ph][qh][rh]
C[Here I was very proud of my achivments.  But how should I continue?

AB: Well, don't be too proud here. Even though White is not 100% alive he seperates your two groups and your four stones on the side are weak.]
;B[ne]LB[mg:A]C[AB: This is not bad, you have to try to seal White in completely (well, it doesn't work, which is why your achievements are not too good. Intuitively, I think 'A' is an alternative to your move.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[ng];B[pp]LB[po:A][qo:B][pl:C]C[AB: Finally, but the gap to your four stones is huge. Maybe 'A', 'B', or even 'C' would be more appropriate.]
;W[ic]C[I suppose with this white threatens to cut at   n15. Am I right?

AB: Well, the main purpose is to erase your thickness. You should incorporate strategic elements to your thinking :-).]

(;B[mg]C[AB: Normally I would say this is a good move, but in this case you provoke the White answer, which further weakens your four stones on the right side. And your move does not really protect the cut you were afraid of. See the variation, I think it is the better direction.]
;W[nh]TR[pg][ph][qh][rh]C[AB: Now the four stones are definitely in trouble...]
;B[dp]LB[pl:A]C[AB: ...and even though I favour taking empty corners I think a protection move at 'A' was your only option here.]
;W[qm]C[AB: Even though I think one line higher would be even stronger you are getting into trouble now.]
;B[pk];W[om];B[nk]C[AB: Very painful for Black.];W[rp]LB[np:A]
C[AB: Oops, that's no good. White should seal in the Black corner from the other side with 'A'.]
;B[qq]LB[np:A]C[AB: Likewise, Black should extend to the side.]
;W[rk]
(;B[mh]TR[pg][ph][qh][rh][pk][nk]C[AB: It's difficult to come up with a good move for Black here. It's important that your six stones maintain connection and I think you have to add a stone there to ensure that. The variation is a suggestion.]
;W[ni];B[mi]LB[qk:A]C[probably this is a mistake. maybe p10?

AB: Well, with this move you give up the four stones, which is big, probably too big. On the other hand you get a lot of influence thoughout the board. If you still want to have a chance to win you must change strategy now and make use of your influence. Another move to maintain connection is 'A'. This may, in fact, be your best choice.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[pj];B[qj];W[qk]
(;B[pi]LB[nj:A]C[AB: This is a really bad move. Your stones are obviously lost so you don't want to add more stones. Furthermore you help White in two more ways: First, the more you play out the situation the less options you have later when there may be an opportunity. Second, you help White to solidify his position and do harm to your outside. It would be much better to solidify your outside in sente (see variation).]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[mk]TR[nk][ok][pk]C[AB: That hurts! You have two options now, both of which are bad. Either you give up the three stones as well, then White has so many points that it's virtually impossible for you to catch up. Or you fight for them, but then your influence in the center disappears so that you have no possibility to make use of it later. Either way is bad, White's position is much better.]
;B[ml];W[lk];B[nm];W[kl];B[mn]C[AB: Good!];W[on];B[no];W[cn]

(;B[fp]C[AB: Your situation is not as bad as I was afraid of, but with your influence a more aggressive way of playing is appropriate now. I think a pincer would be good (see variation).]
;W[dj]TR[cn][dj][kl][lk][mk]C[AB: Now White's stones are better balanced and it will be difficult to attack them.]
;B[de];W[dg]LB[fd:A]C[AB: I think White 'A' would be simple and effective.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[fe];W[gc];B[bb];W[ba];B[kc]LB[cg:A]
C[AB: Risky, 'A' would be the safe choice.];W[hf];B[eg]LB[cg:A]
C[AB: I think 'A' is better, both from the territory and the safety point of view.]
;W[cf];B[gg]LB[eh:A]C[AB: Just extending to 'A' is fine.];W[ig]
;B[fi]C[AB: Now it is Black who has a weak group floating around. All White groups are safe, the Black influence was not used. The situation for Black is hopeless.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[ef];B[ff];W[fg];B[ee];W[eg]LB[gf:A]C[AB: Maybe White can risk the ko and cut at 'A' right away.]
;B[gf]
(;W[gh]C[AB Somehow I don't like this move very much. Now White is overly aggressive. Destroying Black's shape (see variation) is good.]
;B[hh];W[gi];B[fj];W[hi];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh];W[hl];B[fl];W[gk]
C[AB: Is this peep really necessary?];B[fk];W[fn]C[AB: Somewhat too direct I think.]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[gn];W[io];B[kp];W[ko]LB[jp:A]C[AB: I don't like this move very much. Maybe 'A' instead?]
;B[jp]C[AB: Good!];W[ip];B[jo];W[jn];B[kn];W[lo];B[lp];W[jm]
;B[hn];W[in];B[ji];W[jk];B[ij];W[hk];B[he];W[ie];B[hg];W[cq]
LB[cl:A]C[AB: White's center group is probably alive (see variation at next move), but this invasion seems risky, because there is no connection around 'A'.]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er];B[fr];W[ds]
;B[dl]LB[cl:A]C[AB: 'A' would be better, because you want to go for territory here and you want to steal the base of the White group.]
;W[cl]C[AB: Now it's easy for White to make a life.];B[ck];W[dk]
;B[cm];W[bl];B[dn];W[bj];B[bm];W[el];B[dm];W[bk]TR[gh]C[AB: The middle game is more or less over now. You have managed to grab a significant part of the lower side because of the weak White group in the middle. I think the unnecessary White cut (marked stone) was responsible for that. Nevertheless I think White has a won game.]
;B[jb]C[AB: Very big!];W[kd];B[ld];W[ir]LB[rq:A]C[AB: Yes, big as well. However, 'A' is also really, really big.]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[ia];W[gb];B[ke]C[AB: Small.];W[jd];B[be];W[bf]
;B[af]C[AB: Is this sente?];W[ag];B[ae];W[bg]C[AB: Is this necessary?]
;B[bc];W[ga]LB[rq:A]C[AB: Small. 'A' is so much bigger.];B[ha]
C[AB: Even smaller :-).];W[lc];B[lb];W[le];B[md];W[kf];B[lf]
;W[jc];B[mc];W[je]C[AB: Tiny.];B[ed]C[AB: There is no way you can kill White.]
;W[hd];B[if];W[hc];B[ja];W[jq]LB[rq:A]C[AB: 'A', 'A', 'A'!]
;B[kr];W[kq];B[lq];W[gq];B[fq];W[rq]C[AB: Finally :-).];B[rr]

;W[hs];B[ks];W[ab];B[ac];W[ca];B[aa];W[db];B[ei];W[di]C[Overall, this game is an example that being overly aggressive usually backfires. You lost your attacking stones and White got a little bit into trouble in the center. The reason for that is that once the attacked party is out of trouble the stones of the attacking party are usually not very coordinated. Also, being forced to kill creates many burdens and makes it impossible to play flexibly. Furthermore, you should study strategic aspects of the game such as thickness and the direction of play.

;B[dn]TR[mk][lk][kl]LB[df:A][gc:B][go:C]C[AB: Now the three White stones are effectively weakened. Even though White has sente he cannot protected all he wants at once. Good follow-up moves for Black are 'A', 'B', and 'C'.]
