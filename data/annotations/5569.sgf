C[I am Black and Won, would like to receive comments to all stages of game if possible

thanks you


Hi, Freakbroth,
I've reviewed your game and have given you a number of suggestions throughout. 
Yes, you did win this game, but white could easily have won. You came out of the opening with a superb position, then white played a good middle game to come back and it was only a few bad plays by white in the endgame that handed you the victory - so it is a good game to review.

newsman];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dc]
(;B[pj]LB[de:A]C[When W takes the 3-4 point on D17 facing your 4-4 stone on D4, it is a very strong move to approach the 3-4 stone directly. See the variations]
;W[ce];B[qf]C[1];W[nd];B[rd]C[would 10D or K4 been better?

This isn't necessarily a bad move, because if W doesn't answer, then you are threatening to slide into the corner and take away his base.

D10 does look tasty, though.];W[qc];B[dj]C[Now that you have forced W to respond at R17, taking D10 is a big move.]
;W[jc]LB[jp:A]C[This is a small move by W, and gives B  the opportunity to consolidate a huge territory on the bottom. W needed to play around A, to establish some foothold there before it was too late.]
;B[gq]LB[jj:B][jp:A]C[instead of G3 Center Area?

G3 seems too small to me. it is played close to the black corner stone, but there are no white stones nearby to threaten it. Why not go all the way to A and grab the whole bottom? Even B looks tempting - it is building a moyo over half the board and white will be forced to invade.]
;W[nq]C[And here comes the invasion.];B[qn];W[pr]
(;B[np]LB[no:A]C[I wanted to press him down but it did not work

actually it did, as I will show you later. However, if you want to push him down, don't play so close. Play at A instead. A go proverb is not to touch the stone you are attacking. When you touch his stone, you give him something to counterattack. If you just play calmly at A, you push him down, while creating a large moyo on the right and in the middle. 
see variation];W[mp];B[oq];W[nr]C[this is too passive for white.]
;B[or];W[os];B[pq];W[qr];B[qq];W[jq];B[rr]TR[of][cg][gj][mo]
C[This is a wasted move by black. there is very little profit to gain here, and white can live on the side. Any of the triangled moves, for instance, are worth more. Unless it is important for life, try not to play on the second line in the opening.]
;W[rs]TR[of][ch][no]C[Same note as above. This is a small move for white as it only saves a couple of stones, which black would need several moves to capture. Any of the triangled moves are better.]
;B[sr];W[ns];B[ss];W[ps]TR[pr][qr]C[I forgot S3

same note as before. These are very small moves compared to the options. Always try to play the biggest move. It doesn't matter if white loses the two marked stones if he gains more somewhere else.]
;B[kq]TR[of][cg][gj][mo]C[This is just greedy. White can escape to the outside, so black isn't going to be able to kill him. Once again, I would have played in the area of the other triangled stones. Black is not going to survive this, as we see. Unless you can actually kill a group, it is better to simply threaten it and build up your own strength. When you try to kill and fail, your opponent ends up stronger and you weaker.]
;W[kp];B[jp];W[kr];B[lp];W[lq];B[mo];W[lo]TR[mo][jp]C[Now white is very alive and is spilling out into the centre. Blacks stones are now feeling the pressure. Blacks' attack hs done nothing for him but it has stengthened white instead.]
;B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[of]C[A calm move by white, taking a big point. The points on the board betewen two moyos, where both players would like to expend, are very big moves. Imagine a bloack stone where white just played. The difference is very large.]
;B[pf];W[og];B[oe]TR[cg][ni][gj][lm]SQ[qc][nd][pd][rd][of][pf]
[qf][og]C[Black is again getting greedy here and trying to hurt the white group. But look for a second, who is stronger in the area? White has more stones in better shape. Black is destined to lose this. Instead, play calmly and take one of the other large moves. Any of the triangled ones are better.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[pe];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[rb];B[pa]
;W[pc];B[pb];W[ra];B[rc];W[qa];B[qh]TR[nb][nc][nd][ne][of][og]
C[So black's attack on the white stones has failed. Black has gained nothing. White has consolidated the corner, and now has a wall of stones facing the top side and centre. Black has now made two questionable invasions which only hurt him, not white. White is now winning the game because of it.]
;W[ph];B[qg]LB[qi:1]C[this is an unecessary move, white can't cut here. If black wants to protect the side he could play at 1.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[oj];B[pk]C[Should I have invaded around G15 at that point?

White is doing a great job here of pushing black into a low position. If you invade at G15 now, you risk white slipping into your only consolidated territory, which you have put a lot of effort into building. So this move is OK under the circumstances, though it would have been better not to get into these circumstances in the first place.]
;W[ok];B[ol];W[jf]C[White plays in a great spot, building a great looking territory on both sides of the stone he just played.]
;B[oi]TR[ee][cg][gj][lm]C[I don't understand what black is trying to do here. He is destined to lose. A guideline for playing against your opponents strength is to approach it slowly. Any of the triangle moves are better]
;W[ni];B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[lm];B[ll];W[dh]TR[oi]C[Now black has gained nothing with the triangle stone, but white takes sente to grab another big point. Blacks' series of small moves is costing him the game.]
;B[ip]C[black should have just given up this stone. White sensibly ignores the move and grabs anoter big point]

(;W[bk]LB[aj:1]C[white is only giving up a stone here, and giving up sente as well. if he wants to close the edge, it is better to play at 1.]

[as][cs][ds][es][fs]C[Black wins this game, but it could have gone either way. Black started very strong, then make some weak moves to let white gain control of the board. White then messed up with one of his own invasions and let black succeed in an invasion. This cost white the game.

If I can give you some advice:
- Try to play the biggest moves. Unless a small move is necessary for staying alive, take the largest point on the board. You may give up some points in one area, but you will gain more elsewhere.
- Don't get caught up in small locals battles that are worth very few points. Take sente to attack in another part of the board.
- Learn to sacrifice a couple of stones to gain power or influence. You can't keep every stone, so don't try.
- When two moyos are close together, the points between them, that are good expansion points for both sides, are worth a lot of points. Try to get them first. When your opponent takes one, don't make a local move, but grab another good expansion point somewhere else.

Hope this helps.
