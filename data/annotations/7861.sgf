C[<Igor> Hi, I will mark my comments with my name. As I am only 7k, please note that it is a 7k opinion - a dan player can say the opposite.]

C[<igor> most common response here is A, see variation (I found 14 profi-games with this fuseki). The  other options I found in the database are pincer at B and tenuki (approach at B - 19 games), then returning to accomplish joseki at A. I think your response is also ok, but too defensive.]
(;W[df];B[cc]TR[bc]C[Is it the best option? Itryed to force his move before connecting.
<igor> joseki move is  marked with triangle, see variation]
(;W[dd];B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[dj]C[Here I tryed to make a territory? Should I played in another place?
<igor> it seems ok for me.];B[oc]
(;W[ad]C[<igor> this move is too small. I would play on the right side or on the top, see variations.]
;B[pj];W[ee]LB[jc:A][po:E][qo:F][jp:C][jq:B][nq:D]C[<igor> Here you help black to take the upper side, while gaining little. I would invade the upper side immediately. Bottom side is also big.]
;B[fd];W[oo]LB[jc:C][po:A][qo:B]C[I think here was a mistake. If he had played in O3 for example I would be in trouble.
<igor> well, looks a little bit strange. I would play A, B or C]

<igor> well, you should ask you about your strategy here. currently white has more territory, so you can play solid and it would be enough just not to allow black to take territory in the middle and make your borders stronger. you do not need to kill the stone.]

<igor> i don't know... black is too strong.  you should have invaded earlier... by the way, white is still ahead now , so you should concentrate on the endgame.]

;B[qa];W[nc];B[tt];W[jl];B[tt]C[<igor> It was an interesting game, thank you! I think, the main things you should consider in your next games are: 
- big points vs. urgent points (you concentrate a lot on a local battle, even if you could tenuki to take profit;
- counting: try to estimate territory during the game. I think some of your moves were strategically wrong because you didn't know that the balance of territory is important.

(I do the same mistakes by the way, so this recommendations are valid for SDK players as well).

Have fun, and write me if you have any questions!

Igor (kuggel at KGS)
