C[Hi
I'm white, around 5k., in the end I lost by 7,5.
main questions:
fuseki: where to play better? (I'll mark some moves)
middle game: direction of attacking?
endgame: i was in byoyomi, so i didn't count well, and didn't play a good endgame, tips appreciated!

Thanks in advance!
Thomas

HI Thomas, My name is Philip and I am 2d AGA. I will mark my comments with "R:"

Overall, I think you played a solid game. In general, you should always look for opportunities to attack your opponent's weaknesses. I would recommend reading the book "Attack and Defense" from the Elementary Go Series. If you can find ways to attack groups, while building thickness of your own, you will be able to play a more relaxed style. Your go sense in the opening is good. In the endgame, make sure you look for the earliest possible chances to play large sente and double sente moves.

tronde [5k\]: hi and good game

(;W[jc]LB[cn:A]C[here i was thinking abouto17 instead, but i didn't know how to answer e pincer

R: This move seems fine. I think you have a couple of options here. You could start a joseki in the lower left with A. Jumping to P11 seems a little slow, but it may be ok. See variation for thoughts on O17.]
;B[cf];W[fd];B[bd]
(;W[cj]C[R: This move is strange. If white wants to build thickness, then C12 is correct. See variation.]
;B[cc]
(;W[dc]C[R: This is inconsistent with C10. White should continue to develop quickly. See variation.]
;B[ch]C[R: This move is slow.]
(;W[cm]LB[cn:A][dn:B]C[R: This is strange. White should play at A or B.]
;B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[I was afraid about black getting too much territory

R: This is correct. However, it demonstrates the problem with C7. If black can take the corner in sente, that will be a big loss for white.]

(;W[fp]C[R: Too slow. See variation.];B[nc]C[R: Black gives white another chance to attack.]

;W[rg];B[qe];W[rf]C[R: Again, white should just capture.];B[mk]

(;W[ln]C[R: These stones are not important. White should try to cause some problems in the upper right. See variation.]
;B[nm];W[ml];B[ll];W[om];B[lm];W[ei]TR[dc][dd]LB[hl:A]C[R: Try to look for dual purpose moves whenever you can. A move at A would reduce black's potential in the center while exapnding your own. Your move, by contrast, does not really reduce black because the marked stones already limit black's development on the top.]
