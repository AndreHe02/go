Cristiano,

My comments are preceeded by "DS".  I hope my comments help you to become stronger.

David Swan.];B[dq];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd];B[dj]C[DS:  This is a little unusual.  D10 is a big point, but B should make a shimari around D5 or P4 instead of this point.  Another possiblity would be to play E16.  One usually wants to prevent the opponent from making their own shimari.]
;W[jq]C[DS: Again.  A big point, but perhaps better to play P4.]
;B[jd]C[DS: ditto.  The stones on the board are loose and not working together. Both B and W look a bit scattered.]
;W[fc];B[qf];W[mc]C[DS: With a B stone on K16, I would be inclined to play safely at O16 or O17 .  N17 is not a bad move though, but does allow B the opportunity to invade.]
;B[lq];W[gq]C[DS: solid play.];B[nf]C[DS: B making a huge moyo on the left, but B is also very thin.  W would have no problems invading.  R10 for B might be a better alternative.]
;W[qd]C[DS: Solid. But at this stage, it is a move with only one purpose - territory.  It would be better to invade the right side around R9 or perhaps D5.]
;B[le]C[DS: this move does nothing for B's position. W is secure in the corner and B is wide open on the right.  A play at P4, or D5 would have more effect.  Perhaps a move at M5 would expand B's moyo on the right while attacking W's group at the bottom.]
;W[qh];B[pj]C[DS: Too high. Fourth line moves are not very effective pincers here.  W can escape three ways. Into the center, upwards or expand down the side.  R10 might be ok.]
;W[pf];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph];W[rf]C[DS: why not just connect at Q15? W has nothing to fear if B descends to S14 as he can easily extend downwards.]
;B[of];W[pe];B[qi];W[me]C[DS: ok, but I think it might be more interesting for W to cap at M5 or even extend to K5.  This would limit B's moyo while strengthening W's group.]
;B[mf];W[ne];B[oe];W[od];B[kp]C[DS: Good move.  Attacking and expanding B's moyo.]
;W[lp]C[DS: This is nonsense.  Never make moves like this. W can be put into atari on the next move. A move at K4 is almost the only move here.]
;B[mq]C[DS: B is being too cautious.];W[lo]C[DS: W is trying to avoid the ladder, but now B can play and weaken W's group at K3.]
;B[jp];W[kq];B[ip];W[oo]C[DS: good shape move. But I think O4 might do better at putting pressure on B's group at M3.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[qo]C[DS: B seems to be more concerned with the corner terrirtory, and is missing the power of B's wall at O14.  Attacking W's K5 group at M7 or so would attack and secure more central territory.]
;W[ol];B[qm];W[pq];B[op];W[pp];B[nq];W[po];B[qq];W[no];B[pr]
;W[ll]C[DS: B does get the corner, but W has ruined any chance B had of Central control.  However, a more powerful play might be for W to play J3 and begin an attack on B's K4 group.]
;B[iq]C[DS:  this is a good move. It attacks and separates W's K3 group.]
;W[lj]C[DS: not urgent.  W's center group is secure.  D5 would be a big move now by either side.]
;B[mi]C[DS: Not important now.];W[mj];B[nj];W[nk];B[oj];W[co]
C[DS: good move.];B[eo]C[DS: Very conservative.];W[dp];B[ep]
;W[eq]C[DS: bad move.  The usual move would be at C3.  Cutting here is a bad idea.]

(;B[gp]C[DS: ???  Bad move.  F3 the only move.  See variation.]
;W[cq];B[fq];W[dr]C[DS: W recovers beacuse of  B's mistakes.]
;B[fr];W[dh]C[DS: A little loose, but OK.];B[df];W[cl];B[cj]
;W[cf];B[ee]C[DS: These past few moves seem aimless. Not much chance for either W or B to make much here.]
;W[ch]C[DS: good. W secures the top left.];B[gd]C[DS: Bad. Eventhought this will allow B to connect, W can erase any potential for territory in the center.]
;W[fh]C[DS: Ok.];B[fl]C[DS: B is making the common mistake of trying to save every last stone.   There is no longer any potential in the center.]
;W[li];B[lh];W[dd]C[DS: Solid move, W is ahead.  At this stage I count B with about 60 points while W has about 80 points.]
;B[gc];W[fd];B[ec];W[ed];B[dc]C[DS: nonsense.]
(;W[fe]C[DS: Nonsense... W should play E18. B would not be able to live in the corner.  See variation.]
;B[cc]C[DS: B has a chance in the corner now.];W[ek]C[DS: the upper left is still unsettled.]
;B[el];W[fb];B[eb];W[ej]C[DS: these moves are inconsistent.  One should play out the top before playing here.]
;B[gb];W[dk];B[bd]C[DS: Bad move.  B should just connect at F19. Then corner is safe.]
;W[be];B[ok]C[DS: again inconsistent play.]
(;W[ml]C[DS: this is a bad move. Q8 would be fine. W has nothing to worry about B playing atari at O8.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[ko];W[fa];B[ea];W[bc];B[bb];W[ad];B[ca];W[ab]
;B[db]C[DS: B is not safe yet. B must connect at B19 to be alive. W can start a ko at B19 for the life of B's group.]
;W[lf]C[DS: W likes to cut. But this cut does not work if played correctly.]

(;B[lg]C[DS: mistake.  See variation.];W[kf];B[ld];W[gf]C[DS: ??? M17 is the only move.]
;B[lc];W[mb];B[lb];W[kh];B[md];W[nd];B[nb];W[nc];B[ob];W[la]
;B[qc]C[DS: nonsense moves. B cannot live without blunders by W.]
;W[rc];B[rb]C[DS: nonsense.];W[qb];B[ka];W[ma];B[jb];W[mh];B[ni]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[kg];B[nh];W[ic]C[DS: seems too deep for me. W is ahead. No reason to create fights.  A move at G9 would gain more for W.]
;B[id];W[jl];B[im];W[il];B[hm];W[ga]C[DS: Finish the center boundaries. W should play at G9.  G19 is endgame worth only a few points.]
;B[ha];W[gk]C[DS: good.];B[if]
(;W[ig]C[Black resigns

DS: W has a tesuji at H18. Do you see it? See variation.    B has at most 80 points, and the upper left is still in doubt.  W has about 100 points.  '

W played a better game of getting the corners early, and B failed to utilize the thick wall that developed at the top right.  Both sides made overplays that compromised their respective positions.]
