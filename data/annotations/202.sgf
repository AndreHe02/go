TM[600]RE[W+Resign]GC[Commentary by Reid Augustin]US[Brought to you by IGS]
KM[0.5];W[qf];B[pj]L[jd][qh][nd]C[reid: I hate to jump on your case right on your first move, but
I would rather see black be more severe than this.  q10 may seem
like a big move, but in fact it is much too easy on white.  If
black already had a stone at or near a (k16) I would say that
black should pincer as tightly as possible at b (r12).  But since
there is no black stone at a, the best move is probably the very
ordinary looking move at c (o16).  It may seem slow and boring,
but it leads to the best exchange for black.  In short, if black
has the extension towards k16, then pincer.  If not, just extend.];W[nd]
;B[ne];W[me];B[oe];W[qc]L[pc][qd]C[reid: when white jumps into the 3-3 point after approaching
the 4-4 stone from both sides, he is offering black a choice.
black can block on one side or the other: a (q17) or b (r16).
the question is now "How does black decide which way to block?".
the easiest way to answer is to play on the side that is wider or
higher.  this means that the resulting moyo for black should be
the widest or highest side.  let's look at both blocking moves
in this situation (see variations).]
(;B[md]C[reid: when black chooses not  to choose...];W[qd]C[reid: white chooses for him, and of course he will
choose the direction that forces black into the
direction that black didn't want to take :-(];B[ld]C[reid: only ten stones have been played so far, but
we can get an idea of how much value these ten stones
have:

for white, his 5 stones are taking about 10 points
in the corner (two of those five aren't really doing
much of anything - perhaps some *very* long range
aji).

for black, the four stones at d16, k16, q4 and d4 are
unaffected by the play so far.  so if we say that each
handicap stone should be worth about 10 points, that
means that black needs to be taking 20 points with his
m16, n16, o15, p15, q16, and q10 (10 points for the
original handicap stone at q16 plus 10 points to make
up for white's ten points).  with the most generous counting
of points for those 6 stones, I can only get about 10 points
which means that black has already lost one handicap stone.];W[fq];B[jp]
L[dn]C[reid: same idea as in upper right corner, only more
so.  since black has committed to the upper left area
(and ceded the upper right to white) then playing at
a (d16) is more consistent.  after the white stone at
r14 is solidly alive, the whole upper right area is
reduced in value.  k4 is the wrong direction.];W[nq]L[dn][cf]C[reid: this is an overplay for white.  he is
perhaps over-confident since he sees black
making so many mistakes :-)

white shouldn't rush to play in an area where
has already re-inforced himself.  better to
play in areas that are still open, like a double
attack at a (d6) or another approach move at
b (c14).];B[no]L[jq]C[reid: again, since the white stone at r14
is solidly alive, the value of the upper
right side is reduced, making this move the
wrong direction too.  i would rather see black
firmly seperate the two white stones with a (k3).

actually, this is almost never a good move for
black (o5).  the only time black should play
this way is when there is no other good move -
the situation should be obvious when it's right.];W[mo];B[mp];W[np];B[mq]
;W[mr];B[kq]L[lr][nr][oo]C[reid: a (m2) would be more normal.  if white b (o2), black can c (p5).]
;W[oo];B[nn];W[op];B[on];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[qn]C[reid: this outcome would be great for black if it weren't for the white
r14 stone!  as it is, it's slightly favorable for white (white gets
20 points in sente).];W[cq]C[reid: this also seems like an over-play for white.  it looks like
blocking on either side will give black a good result, so white isn't
giving black any chances to make a mistake.  playing a (c14) is
probably better.];B[dq]C[reid: this looks like  the best side to block on.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm]C[reid: well, black is certainly resolute here!
while applauding the idea, i must point out
usual sequence: see variation...]
(;W[cf];B[ch]L[fd][df]C[reid: this is a mistake in direction.  this black
stone cannot help to build up any black territory
anywhere.  it seems to be just attacking for the
sake of attacking.  but since the black stone is
in white's sphere of influence, it runs the risk
of having the tables turned on it, and becoming
the attackee instead of the attacker.

once again, the extension to a (f16) is OK, or here might
be a good place for the attach and extend (tsuke-nobi)
joseki with b (d14).  this *almost* looks like a
position where the cap at e14 would work, but black
really isn't thick enough on the right to support it.];W[dh];B[ci]C[reid: black doesn't want to be trying to build
territory on the left edge since there is a
solid white stone at c7.  black should hane and
not worry about the cut.  the center is the
important thing here.];W[fd];B[ee];W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[reid: this is the wrong direction to block.  the
left side can never be big for black.  see variation...];W[dc];B[bc];W[ed]
;B[df];W[dg];B[cg];W[ef];B[bf]C[reid: ??? why doesn't black connect?];W
[de];B[ce];W[fe]C[reid: white is ecstatic with this result.  white now
has a chance.  compared to the previous variation, black
has been seriously pushed around...];B[qh]C[reid: this feels like a  mistake in direction also.
to me, playing at a (q13) feels like the black
stones are working together better.];W[ob]C[reid:  i don't understand this.  it's not sente,
and it's small.  seems to me that r13 would be a
better way to take advantage of black's mistake at
r12.];B[id]L[gk][jd][je]C[reid: a go proverb says "play away from thickness".
this is too close to the powerful f15 stones, and
has almost no affect on white.  and white p18 helps
to undercut any territory black might get on the
upper side, so this is too small.  something like
a (g9) locking up the center looks bigger to me.
black may be worried about an attack from white
b (k16), but responding with black c at k15 will
build just as much territory for black in the center
as white is getting at the top.];W[kr];B[jr];W[lq]L[gk]C[reid: this is too small, and too soon. it's
gote, and not that big.  white needs to try
to reduce black's center with something like
a (g9).];B[lp];W[lr];B[ro];W[rp];B[rn];W[iq];B[ip]C[reid: what??!?! black must connect!  even
if white lives inside here it will be much
better than just giving white the k2 stone!];W[jq];B[kp];W[hq];B[gp];W[jh]
;B[kh];W[kd];B[ke];W[je];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[kf];B[le];W[ki];B[ji];W[lh]
;B[ih]L[kj]C[reid: this move seems a bit contradictory.
it is trying to make territory next to the
strong e14 group. better to atari on the
other side at a (l10).];W[jg];B[ie];W[jf];B[hf]L[kj]C[reid: black has made a decision: that he is
going to try to kill this white group.  if he
fails, he will probably lose the game.  better,
I think, would be to atari at a (l10), and try to
force white to connect on dame. this way, black
seems to have a good chance still.  trying to
kill this group looks unreasonable to me.];W[kj]C[reid: white naturally walks into blacks
territory as he seeks eyes.];B[kk];W[mj];B[li]L[lk]C[reid: if this move kills black outright, then
it is obviously a good move.  if not, it is a
thank-you move.  safer for black to play at a (m9).];W[lj];B[mi]C[reid: this is another "thank-you" move since
the white stones are connected anyway.];W[hg];B[ig];W[if];B[lf];W[kg];B
[lg];W[kh]C[reid: white's shape is not exactly ideal here :-)];B[hh];W[gg]
;B[gf]L[he]C[reid: this leaves some bad aji behind (but
then, trying to kill white here is unreasonable
anyway :-) perhaps better to connect at a (h15).];W[gh];B[hj];W[ic];B[hc]
C[reid: now the white group can fight without fear
as long as white has a (h15).];W[ib]L[he];B[hb];W[jk];B[ij];W[ni];B[mh]
;W[lc];B[jb];W[oj];B[nc];W[pk];B[qk];W[ll];B[kl]L[jl]C[reid: if black  wants to kill, perhaps k8 is better.
this move gives white a lot of forcing moves.];W[km];B[jl];W[jm];B[lk]L[il]C[reid: this loses a liberty. better to extend out
at a (j8) and leave the cut for later.];W[mk];B[il];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B
[he];W[im];B[hm]L[hl]C[reid: a looks better, again, to give white
fewer forcing moves.];W[hl];B[ik];W[hn];B[gm];W[hp]L[mn][ln][lo]
[io]C[reid: looks like white can connect now. black
should just connect with a (n6), white b (m6),
black c (m5), white d (j5).  black can keep sente
this way..];B[in];W[io];B[jn];W[mn]C[reid: oops!];B[gn];W[ho];B[eb]L[bb]
C[reid: i think this would be better at a (b18).];W[ec];B[fb];W[di];B[fg]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[eg];B[dj];W[ej];B[ek];W[bg];B[df];W[hd];B[gd];W[cf];B[kn]
L[lm]C[reid: playing this at a (m7) instead would
give black one more ko threat.];W[lm];B[df];W[ge];B[hd];W[cf];B[co];W[bo]
;B[df];W[cj]C[reid: this makes the ko serious for black as
well as for white!  still, perhaps black should
connect instead of taking the second ko.];B[ee];W[dk];B[de]L[fk]C[reid: looks like black needs to play something
like a (f9) to keep h8 captured and let the  ko continue.  black has lots of ko threats, and
it's a two step ko before black is in trouble again.];W[gk]
(;B[gj]C[reid: this sequence doesn't work very well for
black.  he's pushing white into his weak stones.
see the variation...];W[fk];B[el];W[fj];B[gl];W[hk];B[gi];W[fp]
(;B[fi]L[cl]C[reid: these stones are no longer important
since that black group is alive. black needs
to try a (c8). black seems to have a chance,
see variation...];W[bj]C[reid: now black is dead, and he has no more chance in this game...]

hard to kill the white center group.  this is a
good lesson, that trying to kill an un-killable
group can lead to disaster...])
(;B[cl]L[cl]N[only hope!]C[reid: what if black plays  at a (c8) instead?]

;W[el];B[fi];W[fn];B[fo];W[go];B[fn];W[ep]C[reid: looks like black can win this fight
(barely :-)  white could get a multi-step
ko out of it instead.]))
(;B[gl]L[gj][gl]C[reid: instead of black a, how about atari at b?

if white connects...]
N[how 'bout this way?];W[hk];B[fk];W[gj];B[hi]L[fj]C[reid: black a (f10) next will capture some stones, so
white had better play here.];W[fj];B[dl];W[cl];B[fp];W[go];B[fo];W[fl];B
[em]C[reid: now black seems to be alive on both sides.
the game seems to be close...];W[fr];B[fs];W[gr]))
(;B[dc]L[dc]N[block the other side]C[reid: what if black blocks the other way at
a (d17)?];W[cd]L[eg][dg]C[a and b are normal continuations if the c12,
d12, and c11 stones are not present.  for black
to play a and allow white to play b would be
terrible, so black will play b here...];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[cg];B[eg];W
[di];B[dj]L[fh][ei][ck]C[reid: this looks like a good fight for black.
white must play either a (f12) or b (e11) to save his stones.

it looks like black can use c12, c11, and d10
as sacrifice stones to completely seal the center.
alternatively, he could just make shape with
c (c9) and slug it out in the center.];W[fh]C[if white continues with this move...]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[fl];W[em];B[fm];W[en]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[fo];W[cj];B[ep];W[dk]C[reid: even if black lets the three stones go without
a fight, he gets sente, and an unbeatable board
position (and there is still bad aji in black c8).]))
(;AE[cm][dn][dm]L[em]N[more usual]C[reid: the normal continuation here is black
a (e7).];B[em]L[cm][bm][cl][bl][ek]C[reid: black e7 is "almost sente"  because black's continuation at a (c7) forces white into
low position with b (b7), black c (c8), white
d (b8).  white will usually play at a first
to avoid this.  with sente now, black can
continue to build up the center with e (e9).
or he can use his sente elsewhere if he chooses.]))
(;L[pc]C[reid: when black blocks at a here, he is trying to build a
moyo on the upper side, and letting white have the right
side.]N[upper moyo (a)?];B[pc];W[qd]L[ld][og][pg]C[reid: now black seems to have a hard choice.  if he lets white play
at a (m16), white will have nice shape for attacking the four black
stones. if black plays on the upper side to make his moyo good, it is
going to be hard to get rid of the aji in the two white stones.  if
black just plays at b or c, then white can easily invade the upper
area and make black's p15 group be worth less than white's corner
(s17) stones.  so it looks like black cannot make good continuations
by starting with q17.])
(;L[qd]C[reid: black can play for  the right side moyo with a...]N[right moyo (b)?]
;B[qd];W[pc]L[od]C[reid: a white move at a (p16) would be sente and would
lead to bad shape for black (after white hanes at
s16 and connects, black ends up with four stones
at q16, r16, q15 and r15).  so let's just take that
move in sente ourselves instead.];B[od];W[oc]L[nc][md][mf]C[reid:  now we can atari at a (o17) or at b (n16).
which one should we take?  hard to decide... so let's
not take either, but just keep building the moyo in
the direction we first chose to build (the right side)
byu playing at c instead.  we can let white decide how
he wants to deal with the cut.];B[mf]C[reid: now the right side moyo is really starting to
take shape.  and white must answer as there is a double
atari at a (n16).];W[le]C[reid: in go, one must be resolute! once we have
picked a direction, we should see it through
to the end.  full steam ahead!];B[lf];W[ke]C[reid: but white is getting fifth line territory! isn't
that too much to give away?];B[kf]C[reid:  yes, white is getting fifth line territory,
but then black is getting 14'th line territory :-)];W[je];B[jf]C[reid: the point is that what black's getting
is just as big (if not bigger) than what white's getting.];W[ie];B[gc]C
[reid: why does black stop now?  it turns out that
four stones in a row is a "magic" number in go.  there
are many tesujis and go proverbs involving three stones
(like "hane at the head of three stones") because a
three stone wall is still vulnerable.  four stones in a
row are much stronger.  by stopping now, black can be
sure of having 4 stones in a row even if white dares to
cut at o14.

so if 4 stones are magic, why did white play j15? that
makes 5 in a row, doesn't it?.  see the variation.]
(;W[rd]C[reid: this hane and connect is white's privilege
anytime.  let's do it now to make the situation clear.];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]
C[reid: locally, this way of playing is not very good for
black.  he's giving white too much territory.  but globally,
black is getting overwhelming power that is working perfectly
with his stones at k10, q10, and q4.  and g17 is a nicely
timed extension from d16 that cuts like a knife into the
white territory, keeping it down to a managable size.  it
looks to me like black is actually gaining here (he has more
than his original 5 stone handicap).])
(;AE[ie][gc]L[if][hd]N[4 in a row?]C[reid: white has four stones in a row here.  doesn't that
mean he can hane at a (j14) or slide at b (h16)?];L[md][nc]C[reid: the key thing to remember here is that black has
held the atari at a (n16) in reserve.  if we make the
sente exchange of a for b...];B[md];W[nc]C[reid: and count again, we see that there are really
only three white stones in a row - back to the
vulnerable stage.  what this means, is that if white
doesn't make the simple extension at j15 (to make
four in a row) then there will be some aji there for
black to take advantage of.  the possible variations
are many and complicated, but any fight that includes
bad aji for white is an easier fight for black to
take on.])))
