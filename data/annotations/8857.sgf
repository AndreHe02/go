C[Hi, here is a close game where I was playing black.

I feel like I made mistakes in the early game, which made black behind. Then white allowed me to build the center and get ahead. White played better in the yose, where I feel like I lost a lot of points.

Could you please point out the biggest mistakes as you see them ?

Thanks !

Kalle: Hello! This was an interesting and a tight game. I have tried to answer your questions and also to comment on some strategic and tactical details when it seemed important to me. Read also my conclusion in the end of the game.

My comments will start with "Kalle:".];B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[oc]
;B[dp];W[qg];B[pe]LB[od:A]C[Would A be better ?

Kalle: This move is standard. Attaching at A builds some outside influence, but I don't see any clear reason for doing that now. I think it's more important to take the corner territory in this situation, so I would choose your move instead of A.]
;W[qj]
(;B[nd]TR[qg][qj]C[Kalle: This move is inefficient, because the two white stones below are already quite strong. Black can't use the resulting wall effectively and loses the points in the corner.

I think you should take the corner instead. See variation.]
;W[nc];B[md]LB[ld:A]C[In the review, my opponent said A instead was joseki. It looks like both are playable.

Kalle: If you want to check some variations, I recommend that you start at eidogo.com. They have many joseki in their database, and the commentary seems to be very close to what you'll find in Ishida's classical series "Dictionary of Basic Joseki".

I don't know this sequence myself, Eidogo gives indeed A for Black's next move.]
;W[mc];B[kd]LB[ld:A]C[Kalle: I think this could be at A as well.]
;W[kc]
(;B[lc]LB[jc:A]C[Kalle: I would hane at A instead in order to seal White in here. See variation.]
;W[lb];B[ld];W[jc]LB[lb:B][lc:A]C[Kalle: Now White is ahead in the pushing battle. The exhange A-B only helps White.]
;B[ql]LB[pc:A]TR[qg][qj]C[White said to play A first. I'm not sure, presuring this group seems to use the wall better ?

Kalle: You're right. The point A takes the corner and makes a base, but it's not so urgent now because you have built a wall towards the center and your stones don't need a base immediately. Pressuring the white stones gives you the initiative and helps you build up the bottom side.]
;W[pl];B[pk]LB[pm:A][qm:B]C[White said A instead, but this looks too easy for him.

Kalle: Your move is the most aggressive choice. It's only playable if white can't capture it after he cuts.

Playing at A or B instead gives you a strong shape in the lower right corner with no complications, so I think it's probably the best way here. But your way is more interesting!]
;W[qk];B[qm];W[pm];B[qn];W[ok];B[pj];W[oi]TR[qj][qk]C[I didn't see this move coming.

Kalle: Since the ladder doesn't work, this is the only thing White can try. White cannot capture your two stones even with this move, though, so the idea here is to squeeze your stones as much as possible in order to get influence towards the center. But in the end the result is not good for White, so I guess your aggressive move was indeed playable :). See variation.]
(;B[ph]TR[qg]C[White said I could save my stones, but i'm not sure. Sacrificing seems better here.

Kalle: Capturing the marked stone is quite big, because is stabilizes your group at the top, but it lets White get away a little too easily. But the game looks OK for you after this anyway.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[cj];B[jp];W[cn];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[cq];B[dq]
LB[co:A]TR[jp]C[Maybe A instead ? I wanted to build the bottom, but he gets a nice corner this way...

Kalle: You can't get everything at the same time ;). This move is perfect for building up the bottom, and it is the correct choice in my opinion. The point A would miss the right direction. It is important to try to use your marked stone, and build some kind of a framework at the bottom.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[bm];B[de]LB[em:A][on:B]TR[ok][pl]
[pm]C[Josekipedia says A now, but this looks bigger right now.

Kalle: Usually turning at A is sente and very big for the balance of moyos, but I think you're right that in this situation your move is bigger. The White strength at the marked stones makes it difficult for you to build up a big moyo at the bottom, which lessens the value of A quite a lot. The point B looks quite big for Black,]
;W[ce]
(;B[dd]LB[cf:A]TR[cj]C[I didn't want to play at A because of the marked stones. Are there other ways here ?

Kalle: This is a diffiult question for me. It's clear that you can't get nice extension down the side because of the marked stone, so you have to do something else. I guess it's either your way here or then playing the hane at A and jumping lightly towards the center after that. See the variation.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[eb]LB[db:B][cc:A]C[I don't know this variations, I was expecting A instead.

Kalle: This is one standard variation. Normally Black would atari at B, but here it gives a very bad result. White would take the left side. See the variation.]
(;B[cc];W[db]
(;B[cf]LB[bc:A]C[White says comming at A is normal there. I have no idea.

Kalle: Extending at A seems interesting, but it's relatively complicated. It seems to me that White will get the better result after Black A.

You can check the variations for details, but I also recommend that you study the small avalanche joseki variations separately and experiment with it in your games. That way you will gain a good understanding of the possible sequences involved.]
;W[bc]LB[df:B][eg:A]C[Kalle: You would like to connect at A now, but the cut at B is a problem. Your sequence in the game actually solves this problem pretty nicely.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bf];W[ad]
(;B[df]LB[eg:A]TR[bf]C[Any smarter way to connect ? This is strongs, but feels heavy since I have no base nor shape.

Kalle: Your move makes the group heavy, which is not desirable. Here it's possible for you to connect with good shape at A. The cutting point is not a problem, because you already have the marked stone on the board.

It's very important to move quickly towards the center, when your group doesn't have eyes, so A is the only move here. See the variation.]
;W[mp]C[This looks a bit too early. Isn't the top left more urgent ?

Kalle: White doesn't have any weaknesses and there is no obvious way to attack your stones in the top left, so I think it's correct to play here. Later White will decide how to pressurise your weak stones at the top.]
;B[mn];W[op];B[pp];W[on]LB[no:A]C[White says A instead. This looks ok to me.]
;B[no];W[jq];B[iq];W[kp];B[jo];W[ln];B[oo];W[mm]LB[kq:A]C[Kalle: I think Black might want to atari at A here and go for some territory at the bottom. The first instinct is to cut at B to separate White, but it doesn't seem to give a good fight for Black.]
(;B[em]LB[lm:B][kq:A]C[Kalle: This move is not as big as A, I think. White shouldn't answer. If I were White, I would play at B now.]
;W[np]LB[ie:E][dl:B][lm:C][mo:A][jr:D]TR[cj]C[White says A is better here. I think this is already strong enough, and I would have played B instead. Any opinion ?

Kalle: The focus is still here in the bottom, I think. It was good for White not to play at B, it is inefficient because of the marked stone and the fact that Black doesn't have a lot of center potential at this point.

I think White missed the right point at the bottom, and I don't think A is the best either. White doesn't want to force you to settle the shape by playing atari.

The big points are:

- C: White could connect here to secure all of his center stones and look forward to attacking your top left.

- D: Coming down here threatens to live locally and take away your territory on the lower side.

- E: Playing here would start an attack on the weak Black stones in the top left.]
;B[dl];W[cm]LB[ie:A][ej:B]TR[ec][dd][de][bf][cf][df]C[Kalle: In answer to your question in the next node (77), I would consider the points A and B here. They are similar in the sense that they try to establish a connection between your weak corner stones (marked) and your stronger groups at the top or on the bottom left.

The point B actually looks more interesting for me, because it has a really nice continuation (see the variation).]
(;B[di]LB[jd:A]TR[dd][de][bf][cf][df]C[White says A instead. I prefer my move, helping the marked stones a bit, and threatening the side.

Kalle: See my comments on the previous node (76).];W[oh];B[pg]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[jm]LB[ie:A][jn:B][ko:C][lp:D]C[Kalle: The keima at A is still the most important thing to do next, bumping at B only helps White build up his center influence.

The White shape at the bottom is full of aji, but it's difficult to say how exactly to exploit it. Turning at C immediately doesn't seem work, because White can answer at D]
;B[jn]
(;W[hm]LB[km:A]C[White says A instead. A looks a bit slack to me.

Kalle: I think A is the only move for White. This White move is unrealistic.]

;W[po];B[lo];W[qo];B[pn];W[nm]LB[nn:A]C[Kalle: Now it's important to play A first, then take the ladder.]

;B[lp];W[mq];B[rs];W[ps];B[lj]C[Trying to pressure the white group, even if he can live easily. Is this worth anything, or should I have allowed him to connect ?

Kalle: I think this separation is fairly valuable, because it also stops White from making any territory in the center. If you gain any forcing moves against White by this move, you can consider the move a success.

The top right corner is also very big now.];W[lk];B[mk];W[kk]
;B[ck];W[bk];B[ci]LB[bj:B][dj:A]C[Kalle: A would be better. Then you have a good shape and you would threaten to play B later.]

Kalle: Yes, this corner has been very big all the time after the bottom fight was settled.]
;B[fc]LB[bj:A]C[Kalle: A would be bigger now than this.];W[rc]
;B[ii]LB[ie:A]C[I feel behind there, so I try to build a center. Looks hard, it's open everywhere.

Kalle: It is difficult, but if you can force White to defend his center group, you might get to play A and build some points. A is now the crucial point for both players.]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[nj]LB[ie:C][mi:B][mj:A]C[I think that AB helps black.

Kalle: Slightly, yes. It's now important to play at C.];B[ie]
C[Kalle: A good move.];W[ml]C[Kalle: This move is quite unnecessary, White helps you a little by giving you a free move.]
;B[bj]C[Kalle: Very good, this is big.];W[hc];B[hd]C[Now this is still a game. Could you please point out yose mistakes when you see them ?]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[ih];B[gh];W[hj]LB[jh:A]C[Kalle: White should have ataried and captured your stone. Now you should just take your stone home immediately by playing atari at A.]

If you want to play in the corner, I think B is a good point to start from.]
(;B[rd]C[Kalle: This move tries to take some territory, but the Black shape is not good. One should pay more attention to shape than to territory, even in the endgame.]

;W[og];B[nf];W[me];B[pc];W[pb]
(;B[gn]LB[fb:A][bl:B]C[Gote, but it looks like the biggest point. A or B instead, or is this fine ?

Kalle: This is big, but A might be even bigger. This is because White can secure the whole upper side if he plays there first, which is worth about 10 points. See the variation.

The point B is problematic, you can't play it without givin White compensation. See the variation from the previous node.]

Kalle: The ko seems good for Black, like you said, and one of the reasons is that If white loses it, his shape suffers a lot and he will still have to fix it probably. Normally White should play at A, but of course, if he loses that way then there is no choice but to start the ko.]

Thanks for the review !

Kalle: You're welcome, I hope my comments were helpful!

I think you had a pretty good sense of direction in this game. I would think that you could improve best by solving next some tactical problems and studying some joseki, to improve your general technnique in the game.
