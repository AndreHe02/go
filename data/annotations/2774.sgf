C[Hello,

I've played this game in an Internet tournament and got defeated by 4.5. I'd appreciate it if you would tell me what were my mistakes. I've included some questions but any other comments are wellcome. Thanks!]

QianJiang:
I think A is good, to place a stone in the most empty areas will always not bad.]

;W[oo];B[po]C[q6 instead?

I think both ok.];W[om];B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[oq];B[op];W[np]

QianJiang:
I think this is a good point, other choices maybe A, or some points around H6.]

(;B[en]LB[fn:A]C[It seemed to me f7 was an overplay because my h6 stone is high enough to escape. I played e6 thinking I could separate the white stone.


QianJiang:
wF7 maybe a little overplay, but bE6 is bad move, if you want to separate F7, A is much better.]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[go];B[fk];W[hl]C[It seems white got the better out of this sequence, maybe this is where I lost the game.

Connect at A, w will lose 2 ko threats. There is no danger to this b corner if you connect everything solid, so you should do that.]
