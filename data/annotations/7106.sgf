C[I play as black (raginduck).  I start well, but gradually lose territory, and finally a large group at the end.  All comments are appreciated.

Thank you!

> Hi !

> I use the following conventions for review: I call Black he and White she; I mark strong stones with squares, weaknesses with triangles. Sometimes I use smileys to illustrate thickness at work (or not).

> I focused on the strategy, giving little tactical detail so that you concentrate on getting the fundamentals right.

> I commented on some white moves too, but kept silent on most of her mistakes (since she made so many).

> You'll find a summary at move 212.

Having acquired some liberties on the bottom, White should now secure his right group by attacking the corner before continuing the running fight.

He should proceed with A or C, but not B.

I played at A to protect some left side territory.  Maybe better would have been B, after which white will probably live small on the left, but black will acquire thickness on the outside.

> Please observe that in a normal situation, both players would want to play at C or D. Leaving a running fight in mid-air like this is very rare.

> White is catching up quickly now. I find A doesn't secure a solid margin for Black, and it makes the bottom corner fragile.

> So I would go for B to emphasize the outside, aiming at C or D - Black still has potential territory at top and White's stick is still vulnerable, while letting White get B would make things too easy on her.]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[em]LB[cc:A][bd:B]C[Black plays at A, which is probably too aggressive, given that his left group will now be sandwiched between walls.   Black also loses sente.

> As a conclusion, here is some advice about the fundamentals.

> How to use thickness: in this game, Black clearly didn't get enough from his thickness. Not using thickness - letting the opponent take gote to erase - can be an option; but most often thickness should be used actively to unleash its full power. This includes punishing overextensions through uchikomi.

> Urgent moves before big moves: urgent mostly means attack / defense moves. This incluces using thickness to make uchikomi when it is clear the fight is good for you.

> Shape and running fights: help your groups but avoid helping the opponent's. Find moves that jump ahead as much as possible.

> You may go over this game again and spot the moves where either player failed these basics. You may also read (or read again) Kageyama's "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go", the best I know on this matter.

> Global advice: tsumego, lots of it, will not only improve your reading and shapes but also your positional judgement and intuition. This is because those involve a fine perception of the respective strengthes of shapes.]
