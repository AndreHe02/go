C[I have been told that
a) need to be more attacking
b) need to concentrate now upon my middle game moves where currently I react instantly as opposed to looking at bigger picture

In this game I conciously tried to address those areas and so would welcome comments in particular on phase of game between 45-120

I have tried to explain the thinking behind my moves and would welcome comments  on my strategy and ' the missed opportunities ' I just did not see.

Thanks Peter aka Ash

Jewdan: Hello, Peter. I will be more than happy to try to help. I haven't had many chances to play Go recently, so seriously consider what I say before accepting it. I will comment on the middle game heavily, but if I see anything else that might need addressing, I will not hesitate to pounce.

I wrote this review with the freeware program MultiGo. The settings I've used make it such that variations are viewed before the main line, so my commentary will not make much sense if your program does not do so as well.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[jp];B[jc]C[Jewdan: K16 is also playable; this is a territorial move, while K16 is an influencial move. If you were aiming for territory, then you picked the right move. Just remember to balance your plays on the third and fourth line... more on this topic later.]
;W[pj];B[cn]C[Considered c10 / q13 as alternatives but went for c6 as more aggressive, and i had the hope that his response might allow me to play c9 or c10 so creating a double wing formation

Jewdan: This is fine.];W[bp]LB[co:A][dn:B][fp:C][dj:D][bn:E]
[cl:F]C[Have not encountered this response before

Jewdan: It's not a very good move, actually. This does not help White's position very much, and once Black settles himself on the left side, an invasion in the corner is not impossible for Black. So, not only is it a far too territorial move for a stone on the hoshi (star-point, in this case, 4-4), but it fails its immediate purpose of securing territory.

A typical joseki (though not a good one in this situation, because Black has the shimari in the upper left corner) is White A, Black B, White C, and Black D. This does not protect the corner well either, but it does not obsess over protecting it. However, with a White play at E sometime after this sequence, the corner is completely safe, and pretty big.

It is extremely obvious that Black wants the double wing extension, so I would probably decide to play a pincer. I would play F here, hoping to develop influence in the center of the board and eliminating the possiblity of Black getting his own double wing.

I have tried to find a sequence that exposes the weakness of this move, but it is unfortunately a weakness that can only be perceived in the middle game, and I can't create an arbitrary sequence that goes that far. Just remember that Black F5 is a nuisance to White once Black gains the strength to defend that invasion.]
;B[ck]MA[dk]C[as plan BUT open to ijnvasion at c12... wondered about D10 but thought the extension was too loose

Jewdan: You have forgotten the balance of playing on the third and fourth lines. Actually, you may not know what it is, so I'll explain.

In the opening, it is important to balance the number of plays you make on the third and fourth lines. Often, this rule helps pick the best place to play when you are looking in a small area and trying to pick the best move.

Count the number of moves you've played on the third and fourth lines. The ratio is 5:1 with this move; you're bound to play a defensive game with such disproportionate focus on territory.

Next, look at White's last move: B4. As a second line move, it undercuts the value of any territory that C6 hoped to make. And if this weren't bad enough, White now has a wall against your two stones below the D10 hoshi. If he successfully inbetween your C9 and C15 stones, your extension is a little narrow for comfort.

All of this combines to say: leap to the fourth line! It allows Black to live on the third line between your two groups, but there's not a lot you can do about it, nor should you want to. The meager territory he gains from that will give you crushing influence in the center.

My favorite move for this situation is E9 (marked). It is far enough away from both your C9 stone and your shimari in the upper left AND high enough to focus on influence. If you can't understand that, just look at how it rests on the board; it is visually appealling. Often, the moves that look good aesthetically are the good moves, and it takes a lot of play and reading to figure out why.

As for an extension to C10, it is uncuttable, but is still too low. D10 just sucks because it is too close to the shimari, too far away from the C6 stone, and overall is cuttable.]
;W[ch]C[which he played :-(

Jewdan: Who cares? It was inevitable. That is actually the purpose of a moyo.

Moyos are big to invite invasions. The opponent cannot just let you make territory there, so eventually he must stop trying to make territory to destroy yours. That allows you to gain strength while he struggles, and then you can use that strength elsewhere on the board.

Of course, now that I've said that, I need to find a move that backs it up... which is usually difficult for me XD The White stone is by definition weak, but so is your Black group on the left side, because its base is undermined. It is troublesome, if not impossible, to successfully attack when you have a weak point. If this play had been at D9, this would not be an issue.

In the end, I probably would have picked D13 as well, but E10 is possibly the best. I'll discuss all the other moves you considered.]

(;B[dg]C[unsure here. D13 was aimed at building a moyo at the top and relying upon c6-9 being a living grp

i also considered e10 or e13

Fleetingly i wondered about an invasion of my own at G4

or to ignore it and play r13.

Trying to be more aggressive.. d13

Jewdan: Yes, but overall, it may be too aggressive. There is a proverb that says "Don't attatch to weak stones." A shoulder hit such as this is not exactly attatching, but it gets a similar result: it enables White to grow stronger in a contact battle, as opposed to weaker in a running battle.

In the heat of a game, though, I would have picked this, too. *blushes*]
;W[cj]C[Jewdan: White plays the connection tesuji, which is one of the ways to make sabaki (living shape). There is nothing you could have done to prevent this good move, or the results it gets. Just remember it for your own games and try it out.

It's too bad that White didn't use it well, though.]
(;B[dj]C[considered also b10 but had vague ideas of an outer wall of influence forming if d10]
;W[di];B[bj]C[now d10, also considering life for c6-9 grp

Jewdan: This should be considered more as an attacking move, because White's B4 stone still undermines Black's base.]
;W[eh]MA[fi]LB[dh:A][ci:B][ei:C][ej:D]C[Jewdan: Hmm... probably not the best move here. White was probably aiming for Black A, White B, Black C, White D, but this is unrealistic. Maybe the one-point jump to F11 (the X) is better?]
;B[ci];W[dh]C[Jewdan: This is why E12 was bad. Black made a ponnuki (the most efficient shape four stones can make) around C10, and White has been forced to make an empty triangle (one of the most inefficient shapes that can be made) around E11. White is now being slapped around.]
;B[cg];W[bi];B[cj];W[bg];B[bf];W[af];B[ae];W[ag]C[Jewdan: White has wasted his time. Two more moves are required before he has even one eye, and all these plays are endgame. He should run.]

(;B[be]C[It all looks very heavy but i felt ok. C17 corner looked safe and a wall forming as part of my upper moyo. Meanwhile the c9 grp looked alive with possibility of moving out to centre

Jewdan: It's worse than heavy; it's meaningless. There is no way White can successfully invade there. Black is far better served by jumping to F10 or F14 to continue the assault on the group. I would play F14 simply because F10 has grown plenty strong already.]
;W[ai]C[Jewdan: White must run! This move only worsens the situation. The best move for Black is probably to take F14, but B12 is fun, too.]

(;B[qn]C[i have been caughgt out many times where my opponent grows a moyo by stealth..and i suddenly realize i am lost.
Hence r6. Also considered O3

Wondered about F3 but thought that W B4 made that move inferior

Jewdan: White is in serious trouble on the left side; take advantage of it! You aren't strong enough yet to invade, so build some influence in the center first.

F14 is a sound move that keeps the attack going, and B12 is an obnoxious move that does almost as much.

On the issue of a kakari on the lower-right corner, this is a fine move, but it will probably result in Black having a strong bottom. Thus, gaining attacking strength in the center, then lashing out at O3 is possibly the way to go.]
;W[qm]C[had not encountered this before. wondered about Q7 as a response but went for ' if pincered go to 3,3 as a trusty response

Jewdan: You were already pincered by the stone at Q10. White is violating the parable of not attatching to weak stones. Q7 takes advantage of this mistake, whereas the san-san does not...]

(;B[qq]C[Jewdan: Unlike the crosscut, this enables White to get a good result immediately.]
;W[pq];B[qp]
(;W[mp]C[Jewdan: Fortunately for you, White cowered.];B[pm]
C[now q7 as i thought the r4 grp had life

Jewdan: It's alive, anyway. You could afford to leave and attack the White group on the right without hesitation.]
;W[ql];B[pl]C[was this a mistake? q5 or q6 better preventing the cut

Jewdan: There is no point in making a wall like this. Whenever you have a chance to push into a place where he already has a stone to continue the wall (i.e., the stone at Q10), don't push!

As for Q5 or 6, they are unnecessary. White cannot cut at Q6; look at the variation on White's move to see why.

So, what does Black do? He is free to do whatever he wants; so he could attack the group on the left to prepare to invade the bottom. He could also attack the right side group's base with R12. I think I'd play F14 here.]

(;W[pk];B[po]C[rectifying ' the problem '

Jewdan: Again, no problem. You can stand to let White have the corner if he plays Q5 himself. So, attack the group on the left!]
;W[pe]C[Not sure how to respond to  attachment plays, of which this is but one example

Jewdan: A surprising move, but I don't think it's too good. This invites a fight in an area that White is weak in. Black can respond aggressively with R15.

White should have played Q14 to help his group; Black can't do much about that.]
;B[qd]C[so tried to protect the corner and connect stones

Jewdan: Don't fear fights. This is what people mean when they say you don't play aggressively enough. It's not saying that you don't know how to fight (look at the left side!), but when it comes to an odd situation, you seek a passive solution. Always remember that fighting may be an option.]
;W[qe]C[Jewdan: White got exactly what he wanted.];B[nd]C[Jewdan: There is a proverb: "Hit the head of two stones." Here, you should hane at P15.]
;W[pg]C[Jewdan: This move is too lax; Black threatens a moyo at O14. White must play there himself.]

(;B[pr]C[Phase 1 of the game, the Opening is now virtually over and I wondered what to do next.

I was not happy with Q2 as it seemed small but the idea was to cement my corner.

G4 looks bigger.

OR , go back to original plan and start building walls of my moyo O14

I looked at K15, recognizing that getting area in the centre is difficult and that K stones might work with my C wall.

Again , i had played the c9 group to disrupt his space and live. There was now a possibility to expand this group towards the centre.

I looked to see if W had any weak grps and determined that D12 was the weakest with only 1 eye but could easily run so not an obvious target

Jewdan: Q2 is amazingly small. You were right to be unhappy with it. The rule for endgame moves when not in the endgame is to only play them when necessary. The sequence White R2, Black S2, White Q2 does not endanger your group.

Again, attack the group on the right! Yes, it will get away, but that's to be expected. You'll still gain a lot for it!

Look at the variation on your next move to see what I mean.]
;W[or]C[Jewdan: SMALL! White can't make more than a few points anyway. He should focus on the group on the right. White F13 is a solid move, but perhaps G12 is best.]

(;B[qr];W[op]C[Jewdan: If White MUST play here, it should be at O3.]
;B[oo]C[What happened to my plan!!
This was an instant response to p4 but i felt that it started a B wall and was (very ) loosely opposite the c9 grp

Jewdan: You got embroiled in a meaningless sequence, so you when you went with the flow, it lead to a terrible place. You guys are fighting over six points.]
;W[no];B[nn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ao]C[Jewdan: The crosscut is better. If White wanted to retreat, C5 is the move.]
;B[am]C[Very unsure about this. I wanted to ensure that this grp lived and was concious of W a10 creeping in and destroying base. I felt that i needed at least 1 eye on this base to ensure that life would be maintained.

I have lost many groups which were ' theoretically settled and safe ' because i did NOT settle them

Jewdan: You were right to be wary, but the result was flawed. Gain a base for the group in the center of the board by attacking the group on the right side.]
;W[co];B[dn]C[there is beginning to look to be enough room for 2 eyes nowaround c8 area

Jewdan: You've cramped your stones here. Your strong five-stone formation is too close to a wall of your own stones, and thus becomes heavy. Unfortunately, once you played A7, you became forced to do this.

White's corner in the lower-left is strong now; an invasion will be difficult, even if you successfully form a wall in the center of the board.]
;W[gp]C[plugging my potential invasion point. Perhaps I should have played here instead of A7 ?

Jewdan: You weren't ready for an invasion. You needed to attack the group on the right to make a wall in the center so you could invade. An invasion now is not necessarily impossible if you get that wall, but it wouldn't be pretty.

BTW, White is catching up.];B[ff]C[Concious that i too have a hole at g17 but this seemed more attacking and my top area was beginning to form]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk]C[Jewdan: H8 is also playable, as it gets your crawling line ahead of White's.]
;W[hk]C[W no longer has any weak grps and his bottom G3 area looks imposing. If he can build a moyo based upon his R11 base he should win

Jewdan: This is not true. White's left-side group is still weak. For an aggressive response, the crosscut at H10 is okay. Perhaps the best move is the hane at H8.]
;B[gm]C[played to try and secure my d8 area];W[hl]C[Jewdan: If White connects with J11 instead of this, he is home free.]
;B[gl]C[Jewdan: This is a BIG empty triangle. White has successfully destroyed the hopes of making a wall through the center, so Black cannot invade the bottom now.]
;W[eg]C[Jewdan: This is small. Capping at K15, hitting the shoulder at J16, and reducing at H14 should be considered here.]
;B[ef];W[fg]C[Jewdan: this is amazingly slow. Black has an opportunity here.]
;B[gf]C[I considered G13 here but was concious of 2 point notch at c13 and i seem to lose out every time i try to hane. This built my wall and protected further my g17 area

Jewdan: This is too slow, and leaves the top open to possible reduction from a shoulder hit. I would play J15 to settle the area.]
;W[oe]C[Jewdan: O14 would be better.];B[ne]C[i chose this in preference to p16 as it started to enclose the g16 framework]
;W[od];B[oc];W[nf]C[he hanes at EVERY opportunity,  squeezing my space

Jewdan: The hane is excellent; you should learn to use it more.]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[mg]C[the top area looks good for B but i am concious that it is all empty and doubt my skills to destroy any invaders :-(

Jewdan: I'm worried about the weaknesses in your formation in the upper right. If an invasion can succeed, it will be there.]
;W[mh]C[hane again];B[lh]C[Jewdan: You've created a weakness here. You have two two-stone groups in a row, ready to be cut. You should have played at L14.

Fortunately, White cannot exploit them unless you make a mistake, but disaster lurks around the corner.]
;W[mi]C[Jewdan: I find this to be too passive. The double hane at M11 is much better.]
;B[li];W[lj]C[my moves were played in instant response mode.
I recognized that his q11 area was growing but felt that i could still expand from q8 andthat if i could connect m11 to g14 i would have a powerful area of my own

Jewdan: Now you have THREE sections of two stones. K11, or something similar, is vital.]
;B[hm]C[so i switched point of play to try and reduce his space

Jewdan: You got lucky here... White missed your weakness. See the variation on his next move.]

(;W[im]C[Jewdan: This is a meaningless move, because nobody stands to make territory here. At least, not before the variation I've prepared for this move is played.]
;B[jj]C[looking to break connection between m10 and g10 and also thinking that B k12 would form a table and help my upper area

Jewdan: The cut at N15 is still destructive.];W[ij];B[ii];W[hi]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[ig]C[I was really tempted to play H13  ( hane at head of 2 ) but worried about cutting counter attacks ( which I did not try and read out )
I suppose I could also have considered g13..but this does not work for B

Jewdan: You got lucky with this sequence; now you're likely to keep the entire top of the board.]
;W[hg];B[hf];W[nl]C[Time to consider.
For B, my upper moyo looks promising but full of empty space..can i handle an invasion? There are safe bases for my other 2 grps centred on d8 and s5.
Against this W has a strong position at the bottom and a growing influence centred on R11 which hwe is trying to connect to g11 grp.
I also have threatened cuttinp points at m12 / n15

So my plan is to try and REDUCE his territory by expanding into L6 space and look for sente endgame type moves to accumulate small advantages

Jewdan: With the sequence that took place in the center, Black looks to be ahead. This is the beginning of the endgame, so look for double sente and sente moves.

The largest move I can see is the reverse sente of S15. White does not stand to gain much in the center if you decide to respond, so it's not too big.

From White's perspective, he should have played S16 before O8.

N5 is okay, but N6 is to the point. Still, S15 beats all.];B[nm]
C[did consider n5 ( see my var )];W[ol];B[om]C[Jewdan: You're responding to small local moves. Look at the major endgame points, such as S15, P1, and S7. An interesting invasion might result from the hane at J6 as well...]

If you want to improve your middle game, I suggest that you buy the book _Attack and Defense_ Akira Ishida 8p. It is part of Kiseido's elementary Go series, and will even help you improve your endgame and opening to some degree.

I like to give concepts to remember to help people with their games. The only major one is to balance your plays on the third and fourth lines in the opening so you go into the middle game with a stronger position. Other than that, I suggest you study _Attack and Defense_ to help improve your reading in battles. _Tesuji_ by James Davies will help a lot with that as well.

(;B[eg]C[Jewdan: This move is interesting, but it forces White toward your weak group. It also leaves D14 open, which allows White to undermine the moyo you're trying to build with little compensation.]

(;B[ej]C[Jewdan: Perhaps the best move. It attacks from a distance, has no delusions of grandeur, helps your weak stones, and probably does more than I can see. It would have been interesting to see how this game would have proceeded.]

(;B[gp]C[Jewdan: Be glad you rejected this move! This enables White to attack to weak groups simulatenously with a move like E6. E6 would turn the weak stone on C12 into a strong one.]

(;B[qg]C[Jewdan: This is not as bad as G4, but it's still not great. It leaves an important situation for a move that, at its best, could be seen as a preparation for an invasion at Q6 or R6. White would probably dominate the situation on the left side, end with sente, and then defend the threat.]
