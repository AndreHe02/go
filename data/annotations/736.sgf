;B[cc];W[pp];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq]C[White 6 should be at b or c. Black's position on the left side is low, with little moyo building potential, so disrupting this "moyo" is not urgent. One should always build one's own moyo before invading the adversary's. Only when one is behind in moyo building should one invade. Here, white clearly has better moyo potential, so the strategy should be clear.]

(;W[cj]LB[cm:A][cg:B]C[If black plays a, white extends to A; if black plays b, white extends to B. So there is no hurry to play here for either side. Nothing is going to happen here for awhile. The territory is largely staked out, and no stones are in danger. The action is on the right side.]

(;B[ch];W[cm]MA[dd]C[Black 9 aims to build a moyo, but that really cannot be done from a 3-3 stone. White would invade at X if the right side were not bigger, and then black 9 would look silly. It looks silly anyway, because white 10 gets oba.]
;B[jd];W[qj]C[Black 11 is reasonable. I might choose to play it one space lower. This is looking like a territory game.]
;B[jp]MA[dd]C[X seems the logical place for white 12. But a is still good. This is the right direction of play.]
;W[ed]C[Black 13 has to be at b. Read some joseki books (e.g. Cho's "The 3-3 Point", p. 123). Without this move, white's followup, as in the game, is quite painful for black.]

(;B[gd];W[cd]C[Black 15 at b is usual. Hane after an attachment. Black 15 at a is a good thought though, as it is the vital point for white's shape. But white cannot play a after black b, as black's subsequent atari would destroy white's shape. See variations.]

(;B[dc];W[dd]MA[ec]C[Black 17 is overconcentrated and still leaves a weakness at X. Black 17 should be at b.]

(;B[fc];W[bc]C[Black 19 at b is the only move.]
(;B[eg];W[ec];B[eb];W[bb];B[db];W[cf]TR[ch][eg][cj][cm]C[Black 25 seems to have only one purpose - to extend black's upper moyo by a tad. There are much bigger moves, and multipurpose moves at that. More importantly, there are URGENT moves. Black must develop an attack against one of the white groups on the left, and keep them from linking. A white move to the center at b would put the two marked black stones in a precarious position. However, a black play at b does not seem to be enough at this point. A better plan is perhaps to play a move such as c, and then turn to attack the marked white stones.]

(;B[mc]C[White 26 is solid. It addresses the general issues discussed above.]
;W[ej]TR[ch][eg]C[Black 27 is aimless. It seems to be an effort to run with the two marked black stones. But these stones are quite light, and should at this point be treated as reducing moves in white's moyo - sacrificable if necessary. A move at b seems ideal for black 27.]

(;B[hg]C[White 28 is a good move, in the right direction.];W[mq]
C[Black 29 is an attachment move, which is rarely good. At very least, if black wants to play here, this move should be at b or c. But now is the critical time to play d, just after white makes a double wing, but before they have time to block the corner.]

(;B[lq];W[mp];B[lp];W[qp]C[Black 33 is another aimless move. There is no territory potential in this area, nor is it a severe attack on white. In this area, a play around b, c, d, or e may serve to build a moyo on the bottom. A move at f is probably the best available, however.]

(;B[gj];W[dh];B[dg];W[cg]C[Black 37 should be at b. See variations.]

(;B[eh];W[di]C[Now, black 39 serves no purpose, as the white stones on the left are secure. Black should focus on invading/reducing the upper right, while seeking to expand a center moyo. Black is behind in this game, so should now aggressively seek complications and fighting.]
;B[em]C[White 40 is an aimless move. The center may look big, but it is not. Black's stones are quite loose. White can be content to build up the right side. White b looks nice. White c pushes at the boundary between moyos. Since white is ahead, white should not seek to invade deeply with a, but to build their own moyo. Also, since white is strong on the left, a probe at d is possible, maybe later. If white is really worried about the center, moving out from the secure left group seems best. A move at e works well for this.]

(;W[jj];B[jl]C[Black 41 seems loose. I would say aimless, but it's aim appears to be to surround territory. But this territory is not at all secure. Both players should be focusing on the right. So white 42 is good.]
;W[nj];B[pf]C[Black 43 is the right idea.];W[ne];B[ph];W[qi]
C[Black 47 should probably move out with b or c.]
(;B[oc];W[oe];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc]TR[oc]C[Notice that the marked stone is now redundant. Black has lost a move here. If black wanted to play like this, they should have invaded with 49 before playing 47.]
;W[nh]TR[ph][pf][ne][oe][pd][qd]C[The two marked black stones seem to have been captured on a large scale. This is a disaster for black. However, due to the weakness  of the marked white stones, black should be able to play at b to salvage something. This move is URGENT.]

(;B[nl]TR[pf][ph]C[White should probably secure the marked black stones with a move at b, or thereabouts.]

(;W[ll]C[Black b seems better than a.]
(;B[mn];W[lo];B[ln]C[White must play b.]
(;W[ko]C[Black b...]
(;B[kn]C[Again, white must connect.]
(;W[jo]C[Black b...]
(;B[io];W[jn]C[Black b is no longer so good, but if white plays there next, black has lost the game, so black must play there and hope for the best in the resulting fight.]

(;B[km];W[in];B[ip];W[mo]TR[pf][ph]C[Black can just about hang this one up. The last chance is to try to do something with the marked stones.]
;B[hn];W[il]C[Black 69 is too heavy. A move at b seems to be light enough to create some potential. See the earlier variations.]

;B[mf];W[og];B[li];W[mj]TR[pf][ph][pi][oi][ni]C[With the marked stones moribund, black should resign.]
;B[kk]C[White doesn't seem to be able to block the escape of the black stones, so should probaly just play at b or another big yose point.]

(;W[kj];B[lj];W[lk]TR[jl][km][kn][ln][mn][kk]C[Black should consider playing at b to guarantee a connection for their marked stones.]

(;B[mk];W[ik]TR[lk][ll]C[Maybe just secure the captured marked stones at b.]

(;W[im];B[jk]TR[jj][kj]C[The marked white stones are captured. White should abandon them with gusto by playing at b, or better, c. Or better yet, play a big yose move elsewhere.]

I think one important point was when I allowed White 176 @R8).
It cost me about 25 points of territory.

JARED: Black lost long before this. This isn't a particularly big move. White could have played other big moves if black had blocked 176, for example, at b (J18) in the appropriate figure.

BLACK: Also I was pretty unclear about what was going on in the middle game fight
in the centre. I felt it finally ended in my favour, but I was lucky it happened.

JARED: See running commentary.

JARED: This game was relatively well played. Some of the fighting and strategic concepts were a little difficult, so black did quite well, considering. White seems to be a least a stone stronger.]
