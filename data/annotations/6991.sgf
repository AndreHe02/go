C[JWS: Dear reviewer. I played this game at the club competition. The time control was 1 hour and 15 stones in 5 minutes.

It was a nice close game that I played with white. I had the impression that my opening was good, but that I lost track in the middle game. It would be nice if you could give me some advice on strategic play in the middle game.


Diego Guerrero:

Good day, my name is Diego Guerrero and I would do the review. I'm currently a 1d-2d player on KGS with the nickname of skamus.

I will leave my comments and try to explain the best I can, however if you have any doubt please ask me. I'm not very strong so some of your ideas may be correct, I hope you understand that it's alright to try your own moves, I try to tell you only how I would play on that position.

The game was interesting, and I did it faster than I thought because of your previous answers and the short number of moves to review. Thank you very much.]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[pd];W[dd];B[qn]LB[ep:A]C[DG: I don't find this such an atractive move, as it leaves the weakness of A on Black. Maybe a shimari or an attack on o3.]
;W[nq]LB[pj:A][ep:B]C[JWS: Maybe a defence on the fourth row is more consequent with the 4-4 stones?

DG: I think this is the propper move. The fourth line move isn't for defence purpouses.

Guo Juan said once that the fouth row move is for moyo purpouses, however I can't find any chances for a future moyo. This solid move is the best. There's nothing wrong with the third line defence. You prepare yourself for A or B.]

(;B[pj];W[ep]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[DG: Great move for W. Very heart breaking for Black's plans. Maybe A should be at B.]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[dq]
(;W[fp]
(;B[dp]TR[cp][dq]C[DG: This is an unpropper move because of the shape and the effect it has on the balance of points.

The empty triangle position is very doubious. Also, the move at d4 wont give B any points.]

(;W[nc]C[JWS: I didn't finish the joseki because black didn't play on d5 or c6 and because I would become overconcentrated on the bottom.]
;B[ld]LB[lc:A]C[DG: a nice move. A is also alright.];W[ne];B[pf]
;W[pb];B[qc]
(;W[gc]C[JWS: Should I have put more pressure on M16. Or is getting more strength for the o17-group better?

DG: Very hard. If you're confident about your group you may play this way. However I would play m18 now.]

(;B[ic];W[lb];B[kc]C[DG: B is playing a very dangerous game. He should let go some stones... Now Black doesnt have eyes, W has eyes on the right. and if W plays c15 he got all the corner of the hoshi.

Look at move 21 ideas for more...];W[dj]LB[ce:A][jp:B]C[JWS: Until now I was quite happy. Is that justified?

DG; yes, you're happy. but playing this kind of far move leaves B some possible aji. W may want to play A or B.
I would do A and hope that B starts a fight at B, because he would have two weak groups, the one at B and the upper one. B would be madness for B until he fixes the small group at the top.]

(;B[cf]C[DG: This is an idea however I would try E17, because this leaves B with too many troubles as it makes more weak groups.]

(;W[he]C[JWS: Here I didn't know very good what to do. In the end I put pressure on black's weak group from my strong group. That should'nt be good, isn't it?

DG: I think it's far more helpful to attack the weaker stone right now. You don't know how will your benefit from h15]

[jp:A]C[DG: After B is safer he may want to try something at A, B or C. Of course B's shape is far from perfect, but at least he has one or maybe two eyes.]
))
(;B[me]LB[mc:A][lf:C][lg:B]C[DG: This looks more correct. The idea is to cut W or get a base. This may start some huge fights, is an interesting move.

Of course the idea is hard to see. But you may want to try some easier ideas like A, B or C (However this kosumi at n15 is just an awesome move). Behind them the idea is to fight, W doesn't have a base so the fight becomes clear. However if Black goes for eyes in this little space he will find himself helping W to solidify himself.

Black has to play "lightly", wich means to leave something behind to get some reward, like reducing the points that w could have on the upper area or start a fight or get some influence in the middle to attack with k4.]

[eq]C[DG: I think this is alright for W too.

The position isn't overconcentrated, there is enought space between the stones. The overconcentrated stones are B's wich have a very ugly shape.

Also the position is very nicely balanced for W on the lower area. "high low high".]

(;B[cn]SQ[dp][cq]C[DG: extending is the joseki move. Why?

Black defended the weakness at the marked points, and while he did this he extended far enough to have more points and a propper position.]
