C[I played black in this game. I felt that overall it was a pretty good game for me. There are several mistakes that I've found but I also have some questions regarding an invasion in the top right; I think I was too greedy and this gave away most of my lead and introduced bad aji that, I believe, allowed white to win.

I would appreciate any comments regarding any errors in play or strategy, especially with respect to the top right invasion.

Dakre: hello ;) This game was very close (2.5 points)... that made the endgame quite important... i commented on some of your moves there...
but there were mistakes before as well but most of them you found yourself which is very good because it shows that there is a lot room for improvement for you! if you don't know what you're doing wrong and still loose you have come to a point where it is very difficult to improve... :) the timesetting is quite tight and you may find it useful to play some slowlier games, too...
if you have any questions left please let me know. I hope you find the comment useful]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[qn]LB[qj:A]C[Dakre: This move is not good by white... it induces black to princer which is a perfect extension from the upper shimari at the same time... A would have been a better idea for white]
;B[pk];W[on];B[np];W[jq];B[mn];W[ol];B[nj]LB[ok:A]C[Dakre: A would have been better shape i think... it radiates more power to the top]
;W[ml];B[de]LB[lj:A]C[Dakre: maybe pushing one more time from here is good... white has to react and you get another stone to form your moyo at the top]

LB[cj:B][dk:A]C[Dakre: I think this move is an overplay... white has too much space to extend on the left side and black remains with two weak groups... a better place to attack may be A or B.
White therefore can now princer C6 and strengthen his d12 stone... so he has an ideal dual purpose move... that's why C6 is not so good right now]
;W[ck]LB[cl:A]C[Dakre: this is a good move by white but i'd even have played at A]

;W[jo];B[kn];W[ie];B[kc]LB[hf:A]C[Dakre: when two stones touch each other there usually is a lot of friction and the one who moves first has the advantage... J15 was not a good move because it touched a weak group... through touching both become strong and a proverb says "don't touch what you attack"... but as you ignore this move white has a chance... imagine white playing A now...]

(;B[mf]LB[nb:B][lf:A]C[Dakre: maybe this is a mistake... two moves come to my mind... A and B... they both are a safer way to play for the l17 group... your move at N14 does not connect and does not escape directly, because it can be cut...]
;W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[mb];W[mc];B[lb];W[nb];B[qb];W[lf]C[Dakre: ... but white cut too early ;)]

(;B[md]LB[ne:A]C[Dakre: how about playing from the other direction at A? i t hink black would win that semeai]
;W[ne]C[At this point I know that I have made a mistake. It seems that my only option is to fight for the life of the M18 group.

(;W[jd]C[I think this is a mistake by white. Should white play H18 now? It seems that if he does, I have to start a ko for life.

Dakre: you're right... H18 and black is locally dead but the ko you're mentioned is likely to happen]
;B[kd];W[nd];B[hb]C[Is this a mistake? Is O14 reasonable?
Dakre: h18 is ok, because you would risk a ko else as the variation before showed... if you play o14 now you're getting back to it... and white is not out this way yet, either ;)]
