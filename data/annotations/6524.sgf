C[Comments: Andre Bergholz, 2K, marked with AB

Hi,
here's a game we would like to be reviewed. We asked some questions, but also we'll appreciate all of your comments.

Thanks,

FelisRatus,
Utgarda];B[dd];W[pd];B[cp];W[pp];B[dj]
(;W[jd];B[fq];W[pj];B[mq]C[AB: I think just Q6 is good.


FR: what is the proper way for W to answer N3? How about O5?]
;W[oq]C[AB: Not bad, but I would prefer Q6.];B[mn]C[AB: I don't like this one very much either. The N3-N6 stones might easiliy come under attack.]
;W[pm]TR[oq]C[AB: Again, I think Q6 is better than Q7, the right side is not safe anyways. You also see that the marked stone at P3 is a little slow. Just imagine you could take that stone away and place it anywhere you like. Would you place it at P3?]
;B[gc]C[AB: Maybe the opening looks a little better for Black, but not in a way that decides a 8-10K game. I would always attack a moyo in the middle, which means in the lower left corner in this game. So something like F5 might be an idea. It would also aim at the weak Black N-stones.


FR: Does the opening really look not so good for W? What to do next?]
;W[dg]C[AB: Not so good, I think. If you want to live a move on the third line is better. Alternatives are B15 or C10, which will give White an easy life.]
;B[ce];W[fg];B[ch];W[cg]C[AB: C13 is ok. Black cannot kill White. C13 also enables White to attack, for example at D8.

FR: C13 now look questionable. Is H13 better?];B[gj]
(;W[bh];B[ci];W[ml]C[AB: This move is risky. Now I think H13 is appropriate. Just imagine a Black stone there! Alternatively you could also play F15. The Black corner is not 100% safe.]
;B[km]C[AB: Looks a little strange as White can still easily invade.]
;W[kp]C[AB: Ok.];B[mp]
(;W[qe]C[AB: No. Biggest mistake so far. You cannot just invade at the bottom and then move somewhere else. And this move is not that big. Still plenty of possibilities for Black there. See variation.]
;B[hg]C[AB: Big trouble now for White. I would say the game is now very good for Black.]
;W[gf];B[ie];W[hf];B[if];W[hh];B[gh];W[gg]LB[ei:a]C[AB: Aji keshi. You should leave the situation as it is. If, for example, you play E11 instead, it is sente for capturing with J13. As it is, White robs himself of that possibility without much gain.]
;B[ig];W[fh]C[AB: Again, not much use here. Also, pushing from behind is usually bad.]
;B[gi];W[bi];B[bj];W[fd]C[AB: Black is ahead and can easily play without taking any risks. Just F17 is fine.

Ut: What would be the best way to attack here ? Should B play into the white goup like e15  ? What about b14 ?]

(;B[ec]C[AB: F17 is better. Now there is this cutting point. It kind of looks like a White peeping move without a Black answer. Bad shape.]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gd];B[hc];W[ed];B[dc];W[bf];B[lf]LB[mc:a]TR[jd]
C[AB: This move is slack. Black is in no trouble at all. It would be much better to use the strength to attack the single White stone, for example with N17.]
;W[mc]C[AB: The exchange of the previous two stones is clearly good for White.]
;B[ii]C[AB: Another very slack move, completely unnecessary.

FR: Now it's time for W to play aggressively, but where?];W[jh]
TR[kp]C[AB: White should take the opportunity to take care of the lonesome stone at the bottom. Just imagine a Black move at H4, for example. That would be the end of the game.]
;B[li]C[AB: Good!];W[lo]C[AB: It would be advisable for White to create space towards the left.]
;B[mo];W[ln];B[lm];W[jo];B[in];W[io];B[ho];W[jn];B[im];W[hp]
;B[go];W[jm];B[jl];W[kn]C[AB: Not a bad sequence for White. The Black territory is large, but there are cutting points on the right.]
;B[jr]C[AB: Very strange. Connecting at N7 would be good.];W[mm]
C[AB: Of course.];B[kl];W[lq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ks];W[kq];B[nr]
;W[ms];B[ls]
(;W[jq]C[AB: Helps Black. See variations.];B[ir];W[gp];B[fp]
;W[hq]C[AB: Again helps Black. Better just make two eyes with J3.]
;B[hr];W[be];B[bd];W[og]C[AB: Strange move. Black could probably still live easily on the right. Of course, the game is lost for White. The reason is that there are two White groups which are pityful. Just barely alive with two eyes. White forgot to take care of those groups when there was time. A good example of a game where making your groups live is not everything. The surrounding Black stones have so much more value.]
;B[kb]C[AB: Very riskfree :-). Black could easily go to R3 or R6 even. Or just connect J8 to say "I have won."]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[hd];B[id];W[kc]LB[ld:a]C[AB: What kind of a shape is this?? M16 is much better.]
;B[ih]C[AB: Still unnecessary. If anything, L13 is not bad.]
;W[or]C[AB: Big!];B[ne]C[AB: Black still on the slack road :-).]
;W[oc];B[mb];W[nb];B[lc];W[ld];B[lb];W[md];B[je];W[kd];B[oi]
;W[pi];B[oh];W[ph];B[nm];W[nl];B[om];W[ol];B[pn];W[on];B[nn]
;W[qn];B[oo];W[po]C[AB: The sequence is not good for Black, but good enough.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[rj];W[pk];B[rg]C[AB: Now it's a little too late for an invasion here. Black cannot first stabilize White with moves like P12, P11, O7, etc. and then invade.]
;W[qg];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[ck]C[FelisRatus [7k\]: Времени добавить?
Utgarda [9k\]: неа, усе ок =D];B[cj];W[fi]C[AB: It should not be possible. The game is over.

FR: Is it possible to invade lower-left, or it is time to resign?]
;B[fj];W[ej];B[ek];W[ei];B[dk];W[fo]C[Utgarda [9k\]: это у меня вдохновение, поэтому так быстро играю]

(;B[fn]C[AB: I think atari the other way is simpler. See variation.]

[ka][kg][kh][ki][kk][lg][lh][mf][mg][mh][mr][ms][nh]C[AB: It seems to me that White likes to attack very much and Black is a little on the safe side. Still, Black wins comfortably here. What does that say to you? Sometimes simple moves can lead to success. White tried to play actively but helped Black with many moves. Bad technique. White also neglected own weak groups. That made the game easy for Black who won because of simple, effective moves, such as the cap at H13. Both of you should look into good shape. Black could also play a little more actively, there were many slack moves. That was good enough for this game, but needs to be corrected if you want to progress.
