C[--- Hi. I will be your reviewer.

In this game you played White. Normally, white has the disadvantage of playing second. So, you should need to think about efficiency and try to take initiative.

I think that you can improve your game markedly if you try to take initiative and not follow your opponents around. Always think whether there are bigger moves elsewhere before playing a stone.

To attack, it is usually done after you get strong in some area first. In this game, black is quite eager to invade early inside your domain. You should take advantage of it by sealing the group and get power/influence.

I recommend you read the book "Attack and Defense" to learn the basic principle of attacking and defending the groups.

LB[qj:B][qk:A]C[--- Playing on the wider side first around A or B is better.]
;B[sr];W[fc]C[I knew I could tenuki because I can either extend to about R10, or I can run out toward the center.]
;B[cf]
(;W[id]TR[ib]C[--- When you play a stone on the 4th line, it emphasis the influence over territory. 4th line stone has weakness if the opponent has a chane to sliding underr at J18 and destroy your base. 

It would be more usual to play regular joseki instead in this position. See variation.

J16 is more appropriate if the top right corner is occupied by a white stone instead of a black stone.]
;B[oc];W[qj]C[This was more to prevent Black from getting a good moyo by playing here, not so much to protect my group.

--- It is also important to protect your group also. I think this R10 is fine for doing both jobs.]
;B[ql];W[nn]C[If I had to do it again, I think I'd try Q8.

--- I agree. It is usually better to try to seal of the enemy in the opening phrase of the game.

If bottom white group is stronger, try to capture out right with diagonal move at Q9 might be also possible..]
;B[ol];W[qg];B[lc]TR[fc][id]C[--- Now two stones on the top are a bit awkward. They are not completely settled yet.

This was due to 4th line move at J16.];W[jq]C[I have a feeling I should have tried putting more pressure on the stones at R8 and P8.]
;B[lq]
(;W[gq]LB[jo:A]TR[dp]C[-- The star-point stone at D4 emphasizes influence over territory. It would be more natural if you play K5 and try to build moyo. See variation.

The move at G3 try to secure territory but the corner cannot be secured yet with this move.]
;B[cq]C[--- This invasion is premature. White should benefit greatly .]

(;W[dq]TR[gq]C[--- However, this is a wrong side to block.

The marked stone is too close to white wall. You should block on the wider side.

See variation.];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[eq]LB[ch:B][ko:A]C[--- White stones are a bit over-concentrated with this move. I would suggest you use this move at A or B instead.]
;B[cj];W[ch]LB[jn:B][ko:A]TR[cj][bl]C[It's OK for Black to invade my moyo, but not the other way around, it seems.


--- Actually, this is quite a tight invasion. This invasion is better played later once there is no other bigger points on the board. 

The marked black stone can connect with nearby group easily at B8. So, white does not threaten black C10 at all.

At this point in game, you may expand your moyo first such as the move at A or B.]
;B[dg];W[di];B[ek];W[fi];B[en];W[eo];B[fn];W[fo]LB[hn:A]C[--- Your bottom group is quite strong. There is no need to defend with F5.

Instead of this move, you may consider the move such as A to confine the group on the outside.]
;B[hn]C[That thickness I had is rapidly showing itself to be worthless, which always seems to be the case for me.

--- Your previous move was a bit slow. Please see the comment on that move.]

--- Actually, even if black plays G1, your group is still safe. See variation. 

At this stage, the bigger points might be at A or B.

The move at E1 (or D1) is smaller end game.];B[rf];W[rg];B[qf]

(;W[ng]C[I spent a fair amount of time trying to read whether I could play the cut at N11.  I think I could have.


--- Yes, you can. It might be a bit better than the actual game.]
;B[mi];W[gm]C[I knew I was behind and had to do something drastic.


--- That's a good spirit. You have a right idea.];B[gn];W[gk]
;B[il];W[kk];B[ij]C[--- Black should secure a connection first at K6 before jumping out.]
;W[hm]C[--- Now black cannot get out.];B[in];W[im];B[io]LB[dl:A]
[el:B][fl:C]C[--- Several good moves for white to play at this moment.

Moves around A, B, C can be considered for cutting groups or reduce eye space of black.

I would probably play C, which moves out from a weaker group.]

(;W[jn]C[This is a mistake.  I don't think I can kill Black, but I could have made it a lot more difficult on Black and given him more room to make a mistake.

--- There is no urgency to play K6 at this point. Black K6 should not break through.

See variation.];B[dn];W[do];B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[bl];B[ej];W[ei]
C[This is a disaster, but I don't think D10 helps.  White can probably kill the Black group, but will still be way behind.]
;B[dj]LB[el:A][em:B]C[Now White definitely can't kill the group, and is so far behind that there's no point playing any further.

--- The last hope to kill would be a play at A or B. However, the continuation shows that black can live along the edge.]

So, white should think about running into the center first instead of playing overcconcentrated move at G17.

Later on when white group is safe, he can think about invading at B (C17).]
