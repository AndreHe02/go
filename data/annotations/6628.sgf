C[Hi, I played White in this game.  I felt I lost because I did not have an effective splitting attack on the bottom and right sides. Thanks for your review.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[eq]LB[cp:A]C[Donal: Up to white 4, both players are playing pretty well. Instead of 4, I personally would be more likely to play at A, because opposing 3-4 points are considered to be quite powerful. But this white 4 is OK too.]
;B[op]LB[mp:A][do:B][jd:C]C[Black 5 is in the wrong direction. The idea of black 1 and 3 is to build a huge black framework. Black should continue his expansion, and not worry about White's territory, which is smaller. Eventually White, being behind in territory, will be obliged to invade Black's framework, and Black will then be at an advantage in the fighting.

With this black 5, Black is losing sight of his strategy and complicating what should have been an easy game. Don't complicate the game unless you are losing and have no other choice.

White can now pinch at A, which is a great extension from his stone at the left as well as being a powerful attack. (See diagram.)

What should Black should have done? I would suggest B or C.]

(;W[cp]C[White declines to attack, and plays a slow territorial game. This is another possible approach, but White will need to stick to his strategy and play mainly territorial moves. Playing passively like this from the beginning, White cannot expect to be able to do any attacking. Instead, he will have to let Black make his framework, and then reduce it somehow without being killed.]
;B[cj]LB[pn:A]C[Black 7 is a big point, but it gives White another chance to attack. Playing Black A would solve that problem while also building his own framework.]
;W[pm]C[White 8 is not too bad, as it reduces Black's framework. In that respect, the exchange of 5 for 8 was a loss for Black. It would be better for Black to play at 8 and let White play 5.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[lq]LB[kq:A][iq:B][mo:C]C[With the moves up to 13 Black makes a base. Black 13 is slow, but very solid. If he had played at C, that would leave White with later forcing moves like B and C.]

(;W[nc]LB[fc:A]C[White 14 is in the wrong direction. White already has strong stones on the right, so if Black is going to make a large framework, it's going to be on the left. White has to go reduce it now, with a play at A. (See diagram.)

There are tactical mistakes later in the game, but it's these early mistakes that really stand out. It's really important to play strategically consistent moves.]
;B[qf]LB[lc:A][kd:B][jd:C]C[Black, too, is seems to be worrying about White making territory on the right. That's unimportant now and he should be trying to figure out how to make a framework on the left. He should play A, B, or C, for example. (See diagram.)]

(;W[pb]LB[qc:A][lc:B][kc:C]C[White 16 is fine if Black answers at A, but if Black is thinking, he will play B instead.

(See diagram.)

In this case, White has to skip 16 and play at C.]
(;B[qc];W[kc];B[qk]LB[qh:A][qb:B][fc:C]C[Black 19 is premature. Even without it, Black can answer white A with black B. And 19 is not a severe attack on the white stones on the lower right. So Black should rush to play at C.]
;W[jq]LB[nq:A][ok:B][pj:C][qi:D][qb:E][fc:F][cf:G][cc:H][cm:I]
C[With 20, White is trying to get some sort of attack on Black. This is probably over-optimistic though. Unless you can actually read out a killing sequence that white 20 threatens, for example starting with a play at A, it is better to assume that there is no attack here. After all, White started out by playing  the conservative moves 6 and 8. 6 emphasizes territory, and 8 emphasizes reducing Black's framework. Neither was intended to create attacking possibilities, so it is unlikely that they will suddenly appear anyway. Black, too, played the conservative move at 13.

Suppose you could have three moves in a row, and you could play white B, C, and D, to capture black 19. Is this a big success? Actually this is quite small, as Black will play E to live, and E itself is a large move. That means black 19 is a light stone, not worth the moves it takes to capture it.

Considering everythng, it's still the upper left that is the biggest. Try white F, G, H, or I.]
;B[ic]
(;W[rr]LB[fc:B][nq:C][np:D][no:E][cl:A]C[Donal: Black 21 is in the right part of the board, but since it doesn't attack White's group, it should have been at B. Then Black would have had a won game. 21 would be correct if for example the stone at 16 was black, because then he would be attacking White.

linkai1: A was also one of my choices for 22.

Donal: A would have been a lot better. Having played two moves against Black's group on the lower side, if you can't kill it with a third move, then you have basically wasted two moves, letting Black build a huge territory on the upper left with 21 and 23

Donal: Suppose White could next get the moves C, D, and E while Black played elsewhere. He could kill Black, but he has invested 5 moves to do it (including 20 and 22), which is too many. So if you want to kill Black, you must do it without playing white 22 first. And if you can't do that, then moves in this part of the board are too small.
(See diagram.)]
(;B[cm]
(;W[cd]C[linkai1: In retrospect, I would have rather played this stone at D17 or B16.  The 3-3 seems too easy on Black here, both extensions are wide.

Donal: I'm not sure which one is best. The problem is you needed to act before it got like this.]
;B[cc];W[ce];B[bc];W[ef]LB[de:A][cg:B][ch:C]C[White 28 is slack. Either Black A or B would destroy White. White 28 has to be at C.]
;B[ed];W[ch];B[bp]LB[bq:A]C[Good move, was not sure what to do about it.

Donal, unfortunately, it looks like you have to just play A.]

(;W[bn]C[I misread slightly here.];B[dp];W[cq];B[dq];W[do]
(;B[cn]C[Black 39, 41, and 43 are uninspired. Black captures two stones, but White gets incredible thickness, territory in the corner, and sente. But Black could have tried something else. (See diagram.)]
;W[ep]
(;B[bq]LB[dr:A]C[Also, it's strange to atari at 41 and let White capture so easily. Better to extend at A. (See diagram)]
;W[dr];B[bm];W[br];B[an];W[lo]TR[qk][op][lq][pq][qq]C[I wanted to attack both these groups at the same time.

Donal: Attacking black 19 is small at this point. Better to attack the lower group only for now. White 46 is a good way to use the thickness White has gotten on the left.]
;B[kp]LB[mr:A]C[Coming out at 47 is a little risky, as White can now play at A. (See diagram.)]

;W[gn];B[go];W[gm];B[hp];W[fo]C[Cutting at 62 is premature. This will just force Black to cut White's thin position in the center to pieces.]
;B[gq];W[gr];B[nn];W[pk];B[ql];W[qm];B[kn]C[It would have been better to play white 62 at 69, and let Black play 62. 62 is a neutral point, and has no territorial value.]
;W[qh]C[Now I get a new splitting attack going

Donal: White 70 is an overplay. White has a poor game at this point, but there are better ways to play. (See diagram.)

Let's go back a few moves and try to find a better overall strategy. (See diagram.)]

(;B[pj];W[ok];B[qi];W[ph];B[oj];W[nj];B[oi]C[linkai1: How to continue for White?

Donal: I would resign here. White is too thin in the center to support an attack. If he escapes with his two stones, he will just make things worse elsewhere.]

;W[og];B[nd];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[nf]
(;W[mh]C[White 86 is weak. Black can cut him to ribbons. See the diagram for a better way.]
;B[ng];W[nh];B[oh];W[rf];B[pg]LB[qe:A][rh:B][mi:C]C[Black could also just extend to A without cutting. He could have killed White outright. The lower group is safe because he can play either B or C. However, If White C becomes sente, White becomes a little stronger in the center.

Both players made tactical mistakes in this game, but it is the strategic mistakes that stand out.

Black 5, White 14, 16, Black 15, 17, 19, 21, White 20, 22,  were serious mistakes in direction of play.

Later in the game, White 62 was a conceptual mistake, not on the same level as just misreading.

Go over these 10 moves until you understand them perfectly, and you'll get lots stronger I bet.
