DT[1997-05-28]TM[600]KM[0.5];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[ip];W[pm]C[It's hard to say if this move by white is good or not.
The reason being that it is too far away from the black stone to require
an immediate answer and also too far away from the other white stones to
create a cohesive framework. This move is
often played by strong 'dan' players in 7, 8 or 9 stone handicap games,
but is not often see in even games, I don't think. Black should at least
think about playing elsewhere.];B[np]C[This is not a bad response, but is perhaps a bit
conservative. I personally
would have played at D10.];W[cm]C[Others may disagree, but everything I said about white Q7
applies here as well. D10 would have been a better move from the point of
view of building a cohesive framework. That doesn't mean, however, that
C7 is a poor move. Just that white must handle his own development
differently.];B[eq];W[lp]C[Based on the location of his past three moves,
I would say that white is trying just a little too hard. These kind of
moves are often seen in handicap games where white is actually a much
stronger player than black, but in this case where both players are
roughly equal, white might have fared better if he had developed his own
stones a bit more before jumping into black's territory. Again, this is
not a 'bad' move per se, but it is a difficult one.];B[qf];W[qh]C[Now the shoe is on the other foot. Black
should have anticipated that with a white stone already waiting at Q7,
his approach would be scissored this way. O17 might have been a better
choice for an approach move.];B[of];W[nd];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[ph];B[oh]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[ql];B[rd];W[qc];B[ic]C[This is an overplay by black. With a terrible weak-point
at Q13 this is no time to play elsewhere. P13 would be a nice solid move
that solidifies black's stones on the right, thereby preparing either for
an invasion at the top or to block white entering the center at
P7.];W[pg]C[Yes! Black has given white this opportunity, and white now
takes good advantage.];B[pf]C[This is probably the best that black can do for the moment.
To play at P13 now would give white a huge capture at the right.];W[og]
;B[ng]TR[oh][pi][pj][pk]C[I think that black would
have done better just to play O14 here, and abandon the 4 marked stones
on the right for the time being. By pushing out along line 14 black
reinforces his stone at the top. He can then look for a later opporunity
to attack the lone white stone on the bottom right at N5, etc., and as
he chases that stone into the center, perhaps save the stones on the
right as well.];W[nh];B[mh]C[This is another overplay by black, but white
lets him off the hook.];W[oi]C[If I were playing white, instead of O11, I would have given  atari at O14, and captured the four black stones on the upper right.]
;B[ni];W[oj]C[Who cares about 3 stones? Cut at  O14 and
black is sliced into 3 groups of weak stones!];B[nj];W[ok];B[mf];W[lc]C
[Strong players only
make defensive moves like this when they absolutely have to. White has
let black off the hook.];B[fc];W[df]C[E18 or E17 would have been better. Now black
slides into the corner with D18, and his group is safe.];B[db];W[ge]C[Because of the black stones on the right,
this move is ineffectual. It would have been better played at D10, etc.]
;B[kq];W[gp]C[If white doesn't answer L3, then black M3
builds a nice territory on the bottom. This  move is questionable.];B[gq]
C[Black M3 would have secured a nice territory while white
would still have two stones floating in empty space. By attaching to this
stone black makes white stronger. Another alternative would have been E5
or F5, and force white to run out into the center.];W[hq];B[hp];W[fq];B
[gr];W[fp];B[fr]C[Black has settles his stones and picked up some territory to boot,
whereas white still needs one more move to ensure that his stones can
escape safely into the center. This exchange favored black.];W[dq]C[There may appear to be some potential for mischief here,
but in fact if black had answered this move at D4 he could have captured
the white stone at D3.];B[ep]C[Frankly, this move is not good, but since it threatens to
capture the three white stones it may appear attractive.];W[dp];B[eo];W
[do];B[cq];W[dr];B[cr]C[Not only are the 3 white stones captured now, but the 3
black stones in the corner will be difficult to kill. White has
blundered.];W[go];B[er];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[ar]C[There last four moves have filled in white's own liberties
and given black a living shape to boot. There is nothing more white can
do here.];W[bo];B[co];W[cn]C[Opps!];B[dn]C[Ouch!];W[en];B[es];W[dm];B[ce]
C[Very aggressive
move. But why play here now? White has many good responses, and there
are other big points too.];W[cc]C[This is not a veru strong
defense. Black must play either D15, C14 or C16 here.];B[de];W[ee];B[cf]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[bd]C[This
white move is meaningless because if black plays D17 the white sones in
the corner are cut off, and most likely captured.];B[cj];W[dh];B[be];W[ag]
;B[bg];W[af];B[ae];W[dj];B[cd]C[Wrong move. D17 was a bigger prize.];W[dc]
;B[bc];W[ck]C[Since black can capture the corner
in sente with C18, white must at least give atari at B18 before
he plays anywhere else. Even though C18 is gote for white, it's still
too big to just ignore.];B[cb];W[ed]C[Excellent for black. Later on, he may have a
chance to cut at E14 as well.];B[ro]C[This is indeed a huge move, and it would be hard to say that
this was not correct, but if I were black, I might have played M3 instead.]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[lq]C[Good for white. This is
definately the biggest move on the board right now.];B[ln];W[mn]C[White is invading black's territory, and yet
with this move white invites black to cut the white stones in two! I
think that either N5 or P3 would have been good here.];B[mo];W[kp];B[jq]
;W[kn];B[lm];W[lo]C[Why not K7 here to get well out into the center first?]

Black wins by 18.5 points, mostly because of the bad mistake by white in the  bottom and top left corners.   My overall impression of the play in this game was that both players need
to play more slowly, and give more consideration to 1) possible
alternatives in the local area and 2) the overall situation.

Even though you are playing with clocks, still it is necessary to keep
one eye on the clock, and play neither too slowly nor _too quickly_!!

Good agressive play by both players shows that both have the desire to
improve.])
