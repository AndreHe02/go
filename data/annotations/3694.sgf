AB[pd][dp]PL[W];W[qp]C[Degan:  I am playing white in this game.  It was terrifically close.  I made some serious blunders in the lower left corner.  I have reveiwed the game myself, and ask some specific questions and also try to recall what I was thinking when I made the play.  If you see any mistakes I don't comment on, please point them out to me.  This game was played on Dragon, so I had as much time as I wanted to ponder every move.  I occasionally bring down the SGF to playout variations before playing.

Degan: I nearly always play at 3-4 in the corners.  Mostly so I can be consistant and learn that opening.

krv: Many players advise to play different joseky.];B[oq];W[cd]
;B[lq];W[fq]LB[pj:a][dj:b][jd:c]C[Degan:  I do not want black to get the whole bottom so I approach eht corner on the bottom thinking to either get some of the corner or some of the bottom.

krv: If you want switch to unplayed area often it's better to play in an area where there are a little stones (no matter which color). Now I likely play a,b,c. Your move is not bad, but if black play H3 then they fully settle lower group when chasing your.]

(;B[fo];W[dr]C[Degan:  Is this a good response?

krv: I think this is good. I like here J3 to settle own and weaken M3 group]
;B[cq];W[iq]C[Degan:  So I think I should be able to make life and get some of the bottom.]
;B[dj];W[qm]TR[jd][qj]C[Degan:  Is this too small?  maybe one of the triangles would have been better?

krv: This move is good too. Later you can attack M3 group.]
;B[ed];W[db]LB[hd:a]C[krv: I like here H16 or G17. Also you can play C13.]
;B[df];W[qc]C[Degan:  In retrospect, the 3-3 invasion here doesn't make good sense on the whole board, I have no influence on the center.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[qf]C[Degan: Black overplays, I punish.

krv: Here is still joseky.]
(;B[rd]C[krv: If black play Q15 they make some profit from here]
;W[pe];B[rc];W[qb];B[mc];W[fc];B[fd];W[gc]C[Degan:  This looks way too small now.]
;B[he];W[jc]LB[gc:A][jc:B]SQ[he]C[Degan:  With the square stone, is it possible to cut A-B?  My variations to test.]

(;B[me]
(;W[qj]C[Degan: Looks like the biggest play I can make..

krv: I don't know. At first if you play here you must play higher
(Q10) Also you can play K15 to split black groups, Q2, if black don't answer then attack M3 P3 group.]
;B[io];W[pr]C[krv: D2-J3 group is weak now. At any moment black can play C2]
;B[or];W[cf]C[krv: No need to touch. If black plays C13 you must add one more stone here.]
;B[dg]
(;W[ch]C[Degan:  Should I crawl to C13?  This fight seems really messy.

krv: Here I would play B12. But it seems that K10 point is very big. You prevent black from building moyo and expand your own.]

[hd][jc]C[Degan:  It looks like I got lucky here.  I think that black at any of the squares would have created a large area for balck.

[co]C[Degan:  This is a large area for black.  I think that by playing C7, black and I will split the circled points and I have a change to make life, and make balck's area(s) smaller.

(;W[fm]C[Degan:  I think I am getting greedy here in trying to connect the groups.  Variations to see if I could have made life on the left.

krv: better to fly out with E7. Watch out for very weak D3 group.]

(;B[dl];W[dm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dk]
(;W[hg]C[Degan:  I'm not sure if I gave-up on the left or thought I was alive.  Seems like a foolish time to tenuki.

If you win M15 ko then you win the game. You should continue.
