C[Hello!  I was black in this game, and barely barely won.  I'd like to know where you thought I could do better, maybe a guestimate rank?  Thank you in advance

<J> Hi, I'm Jose, your reviewer for this game. I hope to answer your questions and give you some new insights on this game. Keep in mind I'm not a strong player so there will be mistakes and oversights in my analysis. In any case let me know if you have any questions about my comments 

Regarding your question about a rank I'm afraid I'm not strong enough to be able to tell but you'll get one quickly just by playing a bunch of ranked games. In any case try not to worry too much about it. Its only purpose is to determine how many handicap stones are needed to make the game challenging and enjoyable for both players.



Let's get started with the review.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cp]
;B[qj];W[dj];B[ec];W[jq];B[jd];W[cf]C[Is there a way I should respond to this?

<J> I don't think this is a move you need to respond to. You have the corner enclosed with C16 and E17 so the white stone rather than threatening feels to me a little weak. At some point later in the game you could aim for C12 or D13 and harass that stone and hopefully gain something interesting from it.]
(;B[qm]C[<J> I think this is fine, the idea of expanding your territory is correct at this stage. I think you could also go to R6. 

If you feel like fighting a bit ou could also invade the bottom left at E4 for instance (as you do later in the game)

If you feel like making a huge framework then K10 seems ok to me as well, and maybe follow that up with the E4 invasion or a R3 invasion.]
;W[jm]C[<J> So your R7 is kind of loose against Q4. It's ok for white to play elsewhere where there might be more benefit, but I'm not sure this is the place.]
(;B[no]C[<J> A not very othodox double approach. O5 is not really connected to R7 and white should be able to cut both groups off and make at least one of them weak which would benefit white. 

Alternatives here could be sliding in the corner or a classic double approach, although I'm not sure this is a good option.]
;W[nq]C[<J> It's good to make sure that stone doesn't get isolated]
(;B[qo]C[<J> I think here you need to decide what you want to do. if you want a piece of the corner when you could try getting in with S4. If you want to make sure O5 stays connected Q5 probably does a better job. R5 doesn't seem to achieve much for either of these two goals, not sure if you had something else in mind here.]
;W[po];B[pn]
(;W[qp]C[<J> I think white should have continued with trying to separate black, as in the variation]
;B[md]C[<J> In general it's good you are not afraid of tenuki :-).  I think O5 can still be harassed by white so doing something else there would probably be more urgent. 

I'm also not sure hat N16 is the best place to defend
here.];W[mk];B[nj]C[<J> White's move didn't achieve much other than giving you an excuse to expand your top left framework.]
;W[nk];B[mj];W[lj];B[li];W[kj];B[ki];W[hg];B[jg]C[<J> Ok, again his move didn't do much other than giving you a excuse to close of that side of your framework. you could have tried some other things here too.]
;W[he]
(;B[ie]C[<J> White has two big holes in the E14 and J11 area to consider this a viable framework so I think White should be trying to cut off C16 and e16 and try to make them vulnerable or invade your top right. 

Also now P6 seals O5's doom quite nicely and reults in a nice chunk of fairly secure territory for White]
;W[if];B[jf];W[id];B[je];W[ic];B[jc];W[ib];B[ig];W[hf];B[jb]
C[<J> Sure, white can use J18 to reduce your top left, but I think you  can use your turn to make a bigger and keep him busy for a while, you can come back and plug this hole later.]
;W[gb];B[gd]
(;W[jj]C[<J> The J18 group is more important for White, if black cuts then White can't put any pressure on the corner stones and solidify the side and hopefully the bottom left while chasing the black stones.]
;B[ji];W[hi];B[ok]C[<J> Good hane];W[ol];B[pl];W[oj]C[<J> Either cut doesn't seem to do much]
;B[pk];W[mi];B[ni];W[mh];B[oi];W[lh];B[ih];W[nm];B[om];W[nl]
;B[oo]C[<J> now that you are connected you can safely inflict more pain on white's area]
;W[op];B[rp];W[mo]C[<J> probably better to just block at S3, although this one worked better than expected in the end...]
;B[np]
(;W[oq]C[<J> No need to protect the cut...];B[qq]
(;W[mq]C[<J> can safely close with N4];B[mp];W[lp]C[This next series I don't know what I was thinking really, with so many white stones around.  Should have connected at P6.

<J> Well, you are still ok here, the problem is that N6 sets up a snapback, so if you want to keep pressing from here you could have gone to N6 yourself instead (just be careful you don't run out of liberties when he blocks)]
(;B[lo];W[mn]C[<J> Now is when you need to connect with P6]
;B[lq];W[kp]C[<J>Last chance to connect :-)];B[lr]C[<J> Not sure if this works even with O4 alive, you might as well just take the corner]
(;W[on]C[Bam.  Dead stones.];B[nn];W[on];B[pm];W[no]C[<J> Not sure what white saw here, as far as I can tell he just removed a point from his territory and gave you a free move. Now would be a good moment for white to solidify a bit his territory with E4, connect at H16, stop your advance in the lower bottom corner or even invade your top right corner. Considering your territory on the top right can still be invaded, securing the bottom left corner seems the biggest to me.]
;B[hd]C[<J> You got revenge for the stones you lost in the  snapback ;-)]
;W[fe];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc];W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[ge];W[gf]
(;B[hh]C[<J> Before pushing in...];W[ff];B[gh];W[fi]
(;B[fh];W[eh];B[fg];W[eg];B[ed];W[ef];B[de];W[df];B[bd];W[ee]
;B[gi]C[<J> Good, no point worrying about D15.];W[hj]
(;B[ei]C[<J> E11 will be isolated just because of the way you force white to respond. The F10 atari should work a little better.]
;W[fj];B[di];W[ci];B[eq]C[<J> Good invasion];W[dd]C[<J> Not a good tenuki. It doesn't get anything for white.]
;B[ej]C[<J> Continue with the invasion instead since white was letting you invade with two stones at the same time :-)]
;W[ek];B[dh];W[ch]C[Should have known these stones were doomed.  What else could I have done?

<J> E11 was kind of doomed already, maybe you a stone around B11 could have threatened to either connect with E11 and isolate the big White group or connect with B16. But not sure that would work well. 

As it is now the best thing is to use the atari thread against F10 white stones to further reduce white's territory. 

I think I would still continue with the invasion though.];B[gj]
;W[dg];B[gk];W[gl];B[hk];W[ij];B[ik]
(;W[il]C[<J> Too close, black pushing at H8 and then ataring F8 will will just cause more pain.]
(;B[cq];W[dp];B[dq];W[bp];B[bq];W[aq]C[<J> I thnk E5 is better for white and then come back to deny as much eye space as possible once black is sealed in]
;B[ar]C[I played in this corner in hopes of connecting to either M2 or G9.

<J> Yep, it's a perfectly good idea and you need to invade when you see the opportunity, even if it doesn't work in the end you'll learn something in the process. Of couse invading for the sake of invading is not good, but as long as it looks reasonable...]
;W[ap]
(;B[gq]C[<J> You have an important weakness at B2 that can remove quite a lot of your eye space so you need to be careful with that. So here you could just go to H2 and threaten to connect, since that should expand your ability to make eyes as well as potentially trying to connect with the right bottom coner and be 100% safe.]
;W[gp]C[<J> Again white is playing too close. He is just forcing you to solidify. Here it might be better to try to reduce your base with H2]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[hr];W[ir];B[ep];W[hs]C[<J> Not really needed yet, Making sure the A4 group remains alive and the side territory is reduced as litte as possible is more important]
;B[gs]C[This exchange was a series of mistakes (i've made them before)

<J> No worries, I'm very good at making mistakes when playing Go. It's one of my  biggest strenght in the game.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[fs];B[es];W[gs]C[<J> So after this sequence you have a problem, your black stones can be killed unless you can either make another eye or connect with another group. The good thing is that you move first.]
;B[eo];W[ds]C[After he started moving down here, I figured the stones would die unless I pushed outwards, but I tried anyway.

<J> The thing is that White has to be careful with his A4 group, your group have a lot more liberties than it and you can try to enclose and kill it, so I think for white something like C6 is a bigger priority]
(;B[er];W[br];B[cs];W[cr];B[dr];W[as]C[<J> With this sequence you don't have any eyes at all.]
;B[em]C[Here my goal to connect sort of shows.];W[dn];B[en]
;W[do];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm]C[Double atari?

<J> Yep, either way you are connected]
(;W[fn];B[hl];W[gn];B[el];W[fk]C[<J> kind of pointless. D8 to avoid further damage on the side better]
;B[gl];W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[jk];W[kk]C[At this point, is there a viable way to invade the left side?  Or was there earlier?

<J>  In the bottom half you have the cuts at C8 and C6, but even if there was still a black stone at A2 and was secure, the cuts don't seem to work to kill the A4 group.
In the top half you have the monkey jump, see comment on move 191]
;B[jl];W[im];B[hn]C[<J> Nice];W[hm];B[go];W[ho];B[fo]C[pwmohr [21k\]: Yeah

<J> Indeed];W[hp];B[kl];W[in];B[ll];W[lk];B[ml];W[mm];B[lm]
;W[ln];B[km];W[kn]
(;B[bf]C[<J> Have a look at some information about the monkey jump over at senseis (http://senseis.xmp.net/?MonkeyJump) since it's a technique you could use in this scenario to reduce quite a lot of white's territory.]
;W[be];B[ae];W[bg];B[af];W[ag]C[I didn't notice those stones were in atari until later...almost cost me the game.]
;B[pr];W[or];B[pq]C[<J> Not a good shape, but most importantly, that stone is not giving you any benefit.]
;W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[rr];W[ad]C[Boom.];B[ac]C[<J> Need to be careful in these sort of positions as well]
(;W[ae];B[bc];W[ro]C[<J> Why not just defending R5? I don't think white is able to kill the corner]
(;B[sp];W[qn]
(;B[sr]C[<J> Not needed, let's see what happens if white plays there instead]
;W[so];B[rq]C[<J> Not needed either, you have three eyes in that group: R2, ST1, ST3. If White plays on ST1 or ST3 it's a self atari.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm];B[rk];W[sn]C[<J> Not needed either. This is the same shape as after capturing if black had played at S6 and white is in no danger, so this move is not needed.]
;B[ja]C[<J> Those white stones are pretty much dead, your black stones on the corner have more liberties and should be able to make eyes. If the area worries you then something like C18 can maybe give you more piece of mind. It's alwas reassuring seeing an eye :-)]
;W[qd]C[Now, this is my biggest question...is there a way I could have played to kill these stones?

<J> Well, the invasion in this area is expected. An invasion on the 3-3 point (R17) is normal, should probably have happened much earlier in the game and should be able to live. Here white is giving you the chance to block his access to the corner, which is the best place white can have to make eye shape. 
So the idea here would be to push white to the side and make it difficult, specially since you are pushing it against a group of black stones that has two eyes: P10 and R8. But you can probably kill this way too]
(;B[qe]C[<J> You could also  try the other way here. I'm not sure it's 100% killable but it seems to me it has less changes of success for White.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[Suppose I should have taken the white stone?

<J> I suppose it depends on white's next move]
(;W[oc]
(;B[od];W[rd]C[<J> Your R17 is kind of trapped now and will give white a good sized corner]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[ob];B[oa]
(;W[na]C[<J> I think white can be more greedy here];B[ra]
(;W[pa]C[<J> No need to capture yet, can still expand towards the left]
;B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[qa];B[ma]
(;W[sd]C[<J> T15 reduces more of black points and keeps sente (inititiative)]
;B[se];W[ii]C[<J> Don't really need to answer. But what would happen if there was a white stone at L13? Exercise for the reader :-)]
;B[jh];W[ar];B[cl];W[dk]C[Here I thought "Maybe i'll see how this goes and experiment a little."

<J> It's good to try]
(;B[bm];W[cn];B[bn];W[bo];B[an];W[bl];B[tt]C[Bad Idea

<J> At least you tried];W[de]C[<J> Yep, a good point for white, but there is another bigger one. Can you find it? Answer in five moves.]

<J> Very close game, yes, and could have ended up the other way: check the score if white doesn't pass but takes H6 :-)

It was a fun game to review and I hope the review was useful. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or comments about it. 

My general advice after reviewing the game is to just play a lot of games and also do some life and death problems (tsumego) when you have the chance. 

Here are some links that you might find useful in case you don't know them already:

http://www.goproblems.com -> lots of problems to solve for different levels.
