C[FM: Hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM:" as mi nick is Field Mouse.

jingzou [1k\]: hi
quatarbol [1k\]: hi

The stile of my opponent is one I always have problems with. Everytime I seem to get territory my opponent invades my moyo. How to best attack this type of player.

Normally I try to attack the groups of my opponent and I do get compensation. So I do get somewhere else territory or I can invade his territory while attacking. However during this game I did not manage to do so. I think partly this was due to some very bad moves I played, and partly because my opponent (at least that is what  I thought) played unreasonable moves but I was not capable in proving this.]

;B[kq]
(;W[qi]TR[pn][ro][qp][rq]C[FM: I find this move a bit discutable. As the marked stones are very strong now the right side is small. Because of the strong white stones it will be very hard for black to make moyo there. In positions like this it is usualy good to force black to play on the right side so that his moyo will not be effective there.]
;B[pc]LB[pk:A]C[I did not see a better move. It is only making some territory.
But is was too early to start attack white at A. Letting white play here was someting I did not like either.

FM: this move is good - I think black is slightly better now. A would be too fighting style, this is just perfectly enough for black.]
;W[oi]C[FM: white is very patient in this fuseki, gathering a lot of strength in the cost of speed. Black should play carefully.]
;B[cn];W[jc];B[lc]LB[mc:B][fq:A]TR[oi][qi]C[Is htis the correct side, or better at H17 ?

FM: Locally I think both sides are ok, though this side is more common. But black did not need to respond here - continuing in the lower left corner and taking the advantage there was better. Also when playing on the upper right side B was better locally - with the M17 move black will have to protect the O17 hole in the near future because of the two white marked stones.]
;W[fc]C[I think this is one too wide, but I did not see a way to attack these 2 stones yet.

FM: this shape is considered ok for white - black cannot do any harm to the white position now.]
;B[df]LB[nc:B][ch:A]C[FM: agressive way of play. Now white will probably get one of the A-B points and will create some difficulties.]
(;W[fe]C[FM: uncommon jump - normally white plays D18 first]
(;B[fq];W[cq]C[FM: this move is usually played when white has some stones around so that he can cut and attack the two pincering black stones]
(;B[db]LB[dj:A]C[I do feel now this move was bettter at at E5. This starts to build influence and will make it harder for white to attack C6.
Played D18 so that I could attack the 3 white stones.

FM: this move is too concerning about attacking the white group, but the important area is elsewhere - white has no problems with tenuki here. Your feeling about the E5 move is right - it is the vital influence point.]
(;W[cl]
(;B[eo]C[FM: this connection is too fragile]
(;W[ch]C[Now I do not have a proper move to attack white, so that is why I choose to split the 2 groups.]
;B[eg]LB[hc:A][cj:B]C[FM: natural and good move. When playing this you automatically give up the corner territory, but splitting white and creating two good attack points at A and B is more important now.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[bd]LB[cd:A]TR[eo]C[Missed this move, thought white would play at A, then I could cut.
D18 turns out now to be a wasted move.

FM: this move is not so super-good for white, black can still begin at A and make eyes in the corner and can attack the upper white group in the future. The important thing now is also the marked stone, which was worth sacrificing a few points here.]
(;B[cj]LB[bg:A][dh:B][do:E][ep:C][fp:D]C[Emotions got in the way, becaue of the failure left top corner. Also I thouhht a stone here would make it possible to cut with a move at A.
Move at B is probably better, also because this will give we the possibilty to cut with a ko when game really gets desparate for me..

FM: This move is making things too difficult, creating a hard fight. If there was not the C-D-E thing white can play now, the fight would be quite nice for black. But now things are just too complicated.]

;W[ag];B[dg];W[bj]C[FM: Black suffered a loss here - white gained safety and points and black almost nothing]
(;B[hc]LB[em:A]C[FM: this move is ok, but it is usualy much more comfortable to defend first - the A move is really big.]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[id];B[jb];W[kb];B[kc];W[jd];B[ib];W[nc]C[FM: this move is very agressive, but on the first look white is trying too much here. In this type of position it is usualy good to spend a lot of time, analyzing the position carefully as the way of fight black choses now will influence the global position.]
(;B[lb]LB[nb:B][gd:A]C[Too slow I think. But I did not see other alternatives since  I with any other move I would be sealed in. Althought A might be an option.

FM: this move looks also possible, although it is a bit submissive. Black is aiming for A and B to get some points now, but the attack power is minimal.]
;W[ne];B[le];W[pf]C[FM: nice move]
(;B[jf]LB[gd:A][hg:B]C[Attaking the white group, however the attacked died quickly and let me to connect with got the black group left. So the attack was not a succes.

FM: wrong direction. Basically black wants to attack for profit - with A (peaceful way) or B (probably better)]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[hh]TR[le][jf][ih]C[The 3 black stones look awkward now.

(;B[fb]LB[el:A]TR[dk]C[I did not think I could cut at A.

FM: True. But if you did not want to cut at A then the marked stone was a mistake.]

(;B[dr]LB[ko:A]C[FM: this move does not look very important now - something like A looks good. The problem is that even if white plays here first he does not have any good move in this area. This move loses a lot of speed - now white gets the initiative.]

Yai, this hurts.];B[rd];W[rc];B[qc];W[pd]
(;B[re]LB[jf:B][em:A]C[FM: protecting more stones, but less territory. Now white captures the corner in sente and the game is definitely over.

In the fuseki the game was very promising for black - white had a slow start and was quite behind in territory. I think the psychological turnover was at about move 55 - from that time black did not gain any new points and although black had quite a good influence, the profit from using it was in minimal in the end. I see the biggest mistakes in the A and B moves - the A move was very important for strenghtening your wall in sente, threatening the white groups around and getting the possibility to build a nice moyo on the lower side. The B move was a mistake in the direction of attack - black should have played it from the other way, forcing white to connect out and then finishing the moyo on the left side.
