C[Dear Reviewer,

I get the feeling that my opponent is making a lot of unsound
moves here
(Indeed, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I lost composure during
the game
and became a little angry...mostly at myself.)

He is getting away with too much...but my attempts to punish
him for it
were awful!

Your comments are sincerely apprecitated.  (In addition, perhaps
I should
consult with a psychiatric social worker.)

Regards,
uncas

I don't see any unsound white moves.  There were some thin moves
in the opening, but none that look like real overplays.  Your
mistakes were mostly in helping him make the thin areas thicker,
and in missing key forcing moves.  Also, remember that when you
give up territory for an attack, you must be able to see where
the stones played by you during the attack are going to make
back more territory than you already gave up.

David];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq];W[qi]C[This move is usually one line lower.  It looks like white is
anticipating your framework on the upper side after you approach
at E16, and playing here to limit it.

You could approach the last move from below right away, but your
move is also perfectly OK.]
(;B[ed];W[ec];B[fc]C[
 Sidan 3k : hi];W[dc];B[fd];W[cf]C[After this joseki, the stone at C14 makes it very hard for you
to make territory on the left side.  So you should focus your
attention on the other edges.]
(;B[jc]C[This move looks too low to me.  I would prefer to
play on the 4th line.

You could also try expanding on the right side first.];W[qf]
;B[qe];W[pf]C[Again I prefer the high move.  It makes better shape with the
stone at K17, and puts a little more pressure on the white group.]
;B[nc];W[qn]C[This white move is a little thin.  He wants to help his group
above so he can invade at 3-3 in the upper right.

If you want you can invade right away, but it's OK to wait for
later.]
(;B[co];W[dl]C[If you just want to make a quick life in this corner, the 2 point
jump to the center or diagonal move upward are more usual.]

(;B[dp];W[eq];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq]
(;W[br]C[usually white extends along the edge instead of this move.]

(;B[bm]C[This move looks a little odd to me.  I would prefer to jump into
the center, or extend one more line along the edge to prevent
white from sealing it later.]
(;W[oo]LB[di:A]TR[dl]C[My next play at
"a" is bad I think.  How about "A" instead ?

Usually white finishes the lower left with a move around h3 to
stabilize his group.  Since he left this move off, you should
be thinking about playing G3 or H3 yourself.

It is very easy for the marked stone to run away, and your stone
at a or A will not be making any territory since the upper left
W corner is so solid.  So neither is a very big move.

Since you already played below the marked stone at B7, it can
be lightly sacrificed without much loss.

Since both the lower right and lower left corners are a little
weak, whoever plays first on the lower side will gain.]
(;B[ck]C[Up to here, I think you are playing fine.  This is the first
move that is really in the wrong area.  You end in gote here,
and white gains more points than you.];W[ci]TR[ck]C[This takes much more territory than your marked stone.]
;B[dk];W[fl];B[ek]C[Your 3 stone wall is not worth much since the white stones above
are so strong.];W[mq]C[White gets the big move on the lower side.]
;B[np];W[qc]
(;B[re]C[This move gives up a lot in the corner.  Usually you only
play this way if the thickness you gain on the outside will get
you some attack on the white group on the outside.  In this case,
the outside group looks strong enough, so I would keep the corner
territory instead.

This is your second mistake.  It looks like you are trying to
kill the white group, and when it lives, you have lost probably
at least 20 points.];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[rc];W[rb];B[qd];W[nb]

(;B[qb]C[This doesn't seem right.  Maybe if you extend instead, you can
kill white.  It's not a fight I would want to start in a game
unless I was desperate though.

Even if you don't kill white, sealing him in and getting thick
on the outside is more consistent with your descent at s15, so
you can attack the outside white group later.

This is your third mistake.];W[mc]C[You are giving away too much.  White destroys all of your upper
side territory.  You will have some attack on this group, but
it is hard to see where you can expand your territory while attacking
it.];B[nd];W[md]
(;B[ne]C[This move looks a little slow.  Your plan now should be to attack
this white group hard.  You need more severe moves.  Your corner
is almost alive so you don't need to worry so much about getting
out.];W[kb]C[To prevent the peep.];B[jb];W[kd];B[kc];W[lb]
(;B[qa]C[I don't understand this move.  It looks like a small endgame.
The white group is stable since it is out into the center, and
your corner is almost alive, and out into the center, so there
is no big life and death issue here.

You need some plan to profit from your attack on the upper side
group instead.];W[hc]C[A very effective and annoying invasion.  Since your group on
the right is almost enclosed you have to be a little careful
answering it.]
(;B[id]C[This is the way to play if you are confident of capturing the
invading stone.  As you found out, this doesn't work.
So you should just stay connected instead.];W[hd];B[he];W[hb]

(;B[gb]C[I think you have to let him connect here.  After this move it
is too late for you.

This is your final mistake.  I don't think you can win the game
after losing this this fight at the top.  It looks like
you got angry at the invasion and decided it had to be killed.]
;W[ge];B[gd];W[ie];B[hf];W[jd]C[At this point at least you should be able to read that you don't
have enough liberties if you connect.]
(;B[ic];W[lc]C[
 Sidan 3k : are u  ok ??

(;B[om]C[At this point you are so far behind it will be very difficult
to catch up.  The right side is pretty thin, so
you might do better by invading more directly.  But
first you should play the forcing move at the upper side.

On think I notice is that White is getting the incidental forcing
moves, like N3, L18, J14.];W[if]C[White gets this forcing move.]
;B[gf];W[pl];B[pm]C[Pushing into the knight's move is almost always wrong.]
;W[qm];B[ol];W[pk]C[Now the right side white group is secure, and with quite a bit
of territory.  You need something big on the lower side to compensate
for giving white so much.]
(;B[no]C[Solidifying your wall this way gives white time to extend,  so
it becomes hard to attack him effectively.

Probably better to use this move to attack directly.];W[jq]
C[The running fight
I started with "a" becomes a disaster.  However, the die was
probably cast
by my bad play at the top.

Now is a little too late.  White has a base, and you don't.  When white runs up, he will connect to the thick white group
at the top, so the group is very hard to catch.];B[hq];W[ho]
;B[ip];W[ko];B[jo];W[kp]C[Can you use your thickness here?  You have to catch this group
to win.  I don't think it is possible, but I think you have to
try.]
(;B[jn];W[lm];B[jl];W[mn];B[nn];W[lk]C[If all you do is run across the board and make the center all
dame, you will end up about 30 points behind.];B[ok]C[This move is pretty dangerous.  your center group is much weaker
than his since it has no base, so whenever you play away from
it you risk capture.];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[gm];B[el];W[eo]
;B[dn]C[This sequence gained you only a few points, but makes White so
thick that it looks very much like your center group will die.
You should save this sequence for the endgame after you center
group has stabilized.

In the center fight, the white group was stronger, so you should
be looking for ways to strengthen your own group, not weaken
it.];W[im];B[jm];W[ik];B[jk];W[ij];B[kj]C[It looks like you will crash right into the white thickness above.]

;W[me]C[Now your center group is truely surrounded.  You need to find
a way out to the left.  Even if you succeeded in cutting off
the white center group with your next move, I think it can win
the resulting semeai since it has at least one eye at the bottom.]

the cut.
