C[Hi, Tony:

I'm Bob, 7k, doing the GTL review for this game.

I agree that you were nicely ahead after the opening. I've commented on specific situations as the game goes along.

But if I had to pick one thing to call the key point, I think it would be that you didn't gain enough for yourself while attacking Black's left-side group. Your attacks would have been nice if you had killed his group, but when he lived you hadn't gained much for yourself in the process.

----------
The following is  a game on KGS between 2 16K.  I took white and 6.5 komi

I am playing White in this game.   I felt I handled the opening ok.  I believe i was ahead coming out of it.  I did miss the fact that a ladder I had got changed after a long dragon fight so that evened things up.    I would appreciate any comments on the opening or about the fight in the upper left.]

;B[qd]C[I thought black built his wall the wrong way here.  R14 might be trouble later

----------
Maybe it's not an ideal direction, in terms of efficiency of stones. But I don't guess it's entirely unreasonable given that he has a lot of stones below with which to coordinate and form a large moyo.

Your jump into the corner is quite a reasonable response to Black's pincer here, but when you do so you're pretty much sacrificing the R14 stone in exchange for the corner position.]
;W[pc];B[oc]TR[od]C[This, however, is not a good idea on Black's part.

This hane is OK when responding to an unsupported 3-3 invasion, but when the invader has the outside supporting stone (R14), Black should extend 1 more (at triangle). This is part of the advantage White gets in exchange for losing R14.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]C[You exploit Black's mistake nicely, but you don't quite follow up to full advantage in a couple of moves.]
;B[nd];W[ob];B[od]TR[mc]C[I was happy about this, I got good corner and sente.

----------
So far, so good, but I don't think this is quite time to take sente. One more extending move to triangle is in order.

This would have been a big penalty for Black's mistake at P17. You would have not only gotten a nice corner, but ALSO slipped easily out the side. If Black's going to lose the corner, he should at least be able to seal you in, or at the VERY least force you to crawl out low if you want to get out the side.

For you to stroll easily out of the corner along the 3rd line and STILL be able to rise up along the side in the next few moves is a big hit for him.]

(;W[eq]TR[mc]C[I am unsure that this move was the most profit.  Extended from D16 or attackign at Q5 might have been better.

----------
Leaving aside for the moment the previous comments about the triangle move...

Yes, I agree this is a small move for this point in the game. Establishing a position in new territory is probably first priority (especially before he secures that large moyo on the right). Second priority is taking a big extension from your upper-left corner.]
;B[mc];W[nb];B[mb]TR[md];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm];B[pk]
;W[rn]C[I wasn't sure if this was the right time for this move to threaten his eyespace yet.

-------
I would think it's quite early. For one thing, the Black groups on both sides have too many options, so it's not much of a threat. And even if it were somewhat of a threat, it's not gaining much for you at this point. This is probably more appropriate toward the endgame when you're bucking for pure points, rather than now when you're jockying for position.]
;B[rl]C[Overplay here I think.  I capitalize attacking the corner]
;W[nq]TR[oq]C[Here I would make a comment that will also come up later. When playing in a situation like this, it's almost an automatic rule that you should play moves that are linked to your existing group. Preferably, it will actually have two different links (where links are jumps, diagonals, knight's move or extended knight's move).

Playing this unlinked move just invites him to do exactly what he did, which is walk right between them. Then you have two weak groups to manage.

A joseki-type move to make instead of this one would have been at triangle. It's a cuttable link, but if Black chooses to do so then he's also cut into two groups, so the fight is manageable for you. As it is, Black keeps his stones linked into one strong group.]
;B[op];W[np];B[on];W[oo]
(;B[fc]C[I'm not sure why Black interrupted the play in the lower-right corner. If he had just gone ahead and cut at triangle, you would have been cut into two weak groups and pretty much been guaranteed to lose one side or the other (see variation.)]
;W[fd]C[I made sure to use a joseki that kept a favorable ladder for me]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[cf]TR[de]C[I have never seen this.  I thought for a long while and decided to attack.  This was one of the crucial fights of the game so comments are well appreciated here.

----------
Well, he's clearly going after the weak point in the position you've made in corner, which is the push-and-cut (which is exactly what he does next).

But, you're right, this is unusual, and seems to be rather brute-force way of doing it. Being unusual, I'm not aware of any standard way of handling it. Personally I think I would have gone ahead and defended against the push-and-cut (perhaps at triangle?), and left him to deal with the consequences of invading so close to my strong group.]
;W[ch];B[ed];W[ee];B[de]C[OK, now he's done the cut. But it's a little bit like the dog that chases the car and catches it - what do you do with it then?]
;W[ce];B[df];W[be];B[bf];W[db]TR[ae][cd]SQ[eb]C[I went there to stop the c16 cut and threaten e16 at the same time.

-----
Yes, this is necessary, but it doesn't secure the corner yet. The problem is the gap and cutting point (triangles), which gives Black some ways to jump into the corner and eat up your eye space.

I THINK the corner is safe as long as you can turn at square and make some more eye space, but even that I'm not sure; there may be sequences that Black can force you into ko for life in the corner.

In any case, you DEFINITELY need a defensive move in this corner if Black takes the square. Black finally takes advantage of this later in the game, and even in your fixed-up ending variation your corner is pretty much dead.]
;B[gc]C[I debated if running would just make this group heavy and force me to save it later, but i thoguht i could kill black on the edge.

---------
This gets to my main point from the intro...

Your choice of approach here is correct - secure your weak group while counter-attacking Black.

But I would try not to think of "killing black" at a time like this. Train your thoughts to be "I'll attack Black to gain some advantage."

There are simply too many ways to make life (particularly in this case, where your group is also weak). Unless you can specifically read out a killing sequence, assume that he will live somehow and make sure you're clear on what you gain in the process.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[ef];B[eg];W[gf];B[dh]C[Would giving up C12 for a a wall have worked better?]

(;W[ci]C[No, I agree with this move.

This gets to the main point I made in the beginning. Now that you have Black on the run, you need to gain as much as you can on either side while you chase him out. This moves gains direct territory along the left side while Black isn't just running for the hills without getting anything in return.]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[fi]C[Here also might have been a good time to make a wall]

(;W[ej]TR[gi]C[Yes, this is a good example of what I was saying. This move only helps IF you can kill Black by ruining his eye shape here. But when he runs out the other side you don't gain much for it.

Playing at triangle instead still keeps Black on the run, but builds up your still-weak group on the outside and builds influence there (see variation).]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[di];W[dj];B[ii]TR[no]C[Here is where my ladder goes poof!

----------
Well, as I mentioned Black really should cut at triangle in the lower-right corner, anyway, rather than trying to push and depend on the ladder. But certainly having the ladder helps him just that much more.]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[jd]TR[gf][jh]C[This was a terrible overplay. K15 is better.    I was trying to figure out how to attack  N16   Or myabe G15 here first?

----------
Yes, and this is the other example that I mentioned of keeping connections. The reason K15 is so much better is that it's connected to both of your triangle stones, a beautiful shape. Seeing this in your games should just become reflex.

And it would still threaten to cut off Black's upper-left stones, so he needs to defend anyway.]
;B[ge];W[ff];B[hf];W[gg];B[je]C[My thinking here is my ladder is dead, at least get life for my dragon out of it. Since i lost the side]
;W[ji]
(;B[pn]TR[jj]C[???

Black let you off really easy here.

I only see one move for Black at this point, and that's triangle. I think your large group would be dead, or would live only at large expense to your positions on the rest of the board.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[kj];B[pl];W[nm];B[qm];W[ij];B[gk];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[gp];B[hq]
(;W[hn]TR[fm]C[Another example of the main point. This is a severe threat, but far from a guaranteed killing move.

The problem is that it doesn't gain anything if Black lives. In that case, it just builds a border around an area that Black is already inside of.

Contrast this to a move such as triangle. You still force the Black group to run, but you get a lot of territory in the process.]
;B[jk];W[ik];B[il];W[kk];B[hk];W[fj]C[Looking back I have no idea why i played F10.   I guess to stop an eye, but it seems uneccessry

-----
Yes, good comment. You needed this move to keep working on keepin him cut off from his escape route.]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[in];W[ho];B[io];W[jm];B[im];W[jl];B[fm];W[em]
;B[fl];W[er];B[lq]C[I should have played L3 instead of E2 I think

-----
Agreed. E2 is rather an end-game move. And without a base here your two center groups run some risk of becoming a long chain without eyes.]

C[This is a nice end-game monkey-jump, but turns out to be an overplay here because of the weakness in the corner.]
;B[eb]C[Now that Black has sealed off any outside expansion, you need a defensive move in the corner.

UNLESS, of course, you can be sure that staying connected to your monkey-jump stone will get you another eye, but generally this won't happen.]
;W[ea];B[bc]C[I did not think this was that big.   I thoguht I was unconditionally alive here.

----------
No, this is a mortal danger. I'll go through the sequences at the end of your fixed-up ending.]

----------
I deleted the rest of the real game and kept your variant ending. Then I put the upper-left corner sequences at the end.]
;W[ra]C[I have double ko so black can't ever kill me here. There is nothing left but small end game moves an the upper left.

----------
True enough in the upper-right corner...];B[lb];W[da];B[ka]
;W[ia];B[hc];W[fa]C[...but the upper left is  dead, as far as I can see.

The problem is that Black is sitting right in the middle of your eye space. His two little stones have 6 liberties, while your corner group has only 5.

PLUS Black's two stones have some ability to make one eye by using the edge and the corner, while your group can't. So even if you could come up with some clever liberty-stealing sequence, one eye beats no eye.

So, see continuation for how this would go...];B[ca];W[ac]C[Even if you try something like this to take one of Black's liberties without using one of your own...]
