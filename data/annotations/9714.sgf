AB[pd][dp];W[dd]C[This game was played in South Africa in a local Go Club. I am commenting only for myself (white). Any tips would be much appreciated, especially which areas of the games to focus on. The concepts I am currently focusing on are wasted moves, ways to keep sente (especially in a handicap game) and proper basic shapes and life and death. Opening theory is also very new to me since I rarely play low handicap or scratch games.

Nils: I'll do my best.];B[pp];W[qn];B[nq];W[pj]C[I am not sure about this structure (3 extension). I have seen it used in other handicap games, but would be unsure how to handle an invasion at R8

Nils: I'm fine with it. In a handicap game you have to overplay as white. R8 is trouble, but no disaster at all (see variations). Q10 is a light move. The stones are only sort of connected and you can live with losing one or the other.]

(;B[qg];W[jc];B[cj];W[iq]LB[fq:A][gq:C][kq:B]C[I often do this type of invasion early in the game. Playing at the spot that will allow a 2 space extension on both sides. Is this a recommended way to play?

Nils: Generally, yes. Your stone is safe. But if black's attacking move (A, B or C) is too good it's not worth it.]
;B[gq];W[lq]C[N: Two good corners for black and a small group for white. Not great.]
;B[cf];W[gc];B[jj]C[I found this move rather strange, not sure what the purpose was. If I was black I would rather play something like M17 or C7 or even N5.

Nils: I agree. Maybe it looked cool? :)];W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[qi]
;W[qj];B[qo];W[pn]C[This structure for white looks rather weird to me. I guess it will be hard for black to invade at R8 or something similar now.

N: Two iron pillars. This looks fine to me. White is stong here.]
;B[dl];W[mo]LB[ho:A]C[N: What's the purpose of this? No points here. If you want to enter the center A at least attacks blacks moyo (potential territory).]
;B[mr];W[qq]C[N: Black did not tackle this invasion well.];B[pq]
;W[rp]
(;B[qr];W[ro];B[rq];W[qp];B[sr];W[rs]C[I thought this would prevent an eye from forming here, but it turned out not to work.]
;B[qs];W[or]C[I think I was being too aggressive here and should rather have played P5, sealing the group in and building influence. This move pushed the group out the top (squeezing the toothpaste - like my one friend would say. I was also under the impression that the eye at S2 was prevented, leaving the group with only one eye. But I think this was a mistake on my part.]
;B[pr];W[rr];B[ss];W[rr]C[I don't think this added much. It only gave me the possibility to steal the eye if he did not respond. I am unsure if it was better for black to respond with S1 immediately or not. It does feel like a small move so early in the game and he ended up playing at Q4 and later running out at the top.]
;B[po]C[N: He didn't respond, so why not T3?]
(;W[os]C[Again maybe I should rather have sealed him in with P6 now.]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[on];W[om];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[ln];B[mm]C[N: Let him run. He gains no points, but white is getting stonger on both sides.]

;W[nf];B[pf];W[mg];B[nb];W[mb];B[oa];W[pb];B[ob];W[qe]C[I was trying really hard to make up the handicap by finding weaknesses in his groups. This was the best invading move I could see.

N: Looks a bit hopeless to me. P16 first maybe? Force black to play Q17]
;B[qd];W[od];B[qb];W[lc]C[I could not see a clear path of attack further so rather consolidated. Hoping to attack later. This does give black the chance to play Q15 and completely stop any attack I had, but he did not take it. Again probably to small a move early on and not a real threat yet?

N: I don't think he has to yet. See variation.];B[cd]
(;W[cc];B[de];W[ed];B[hr];W[ho];B[go];W[hn];B[en];W[jg]C[I had to chose between invading the bottom left corner or expanding my territorial framework. This looked bigger to me.

N: I'd choose the corner.];B[hj]C[I don't really understand this move. I would have played something more aggressive like F14, or consolidated my territory at C3.

N: Yes, this does nothing. Endgame moves like B17 or S10 is much bigger.]
;W[cq]C[And now I invade the corner. Maybe this should have been done sooner?

N: Yes];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[cm];W[bo];B[bn]

;W[ke];B[sp];W[rn];B[ol];W[pl];B[ml];W[mq]C[This was a bit of a trick move, since I hoped black did not spot the weakness in the two stones below - especially since we had been playing for a while by then. After missing it he resigned.

N: Sneaky ;)

However, as far as I can see black can save his upper right group and wins the game. See variations. Your friend's mistake was resigning it seems.

Concerning your general questions I'm not sure I'm good enough to say anything clever. Keep practising life and death and keep doing invasions. That's the way to get better. Good luck!]
