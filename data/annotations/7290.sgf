C[Hello, this is a recent game I (black) had in KGS. I had pretty good feeling about my tactics, but in spite of that the game turned out to be rather big win for my opponent  (W+28).

Perhaps I'm being too timid in invasions. I feel I need to work for my own territory, while my opponent gets his compensation because my attacks are poor.

Big thanks for review!


* Hello, this is mafutrct, your reviewer.

* My comments will be marked with an *asterisk.

* I do not have much of a clue about the game of Go, but I'll still try to give you some hints. Please don't think my comments are always correct. Especially, do not rely on my tsumego skills, I kind of suck when it comes to tactical living.

* If you find a move that you never considered yet, learn the idea of that move and add it to your repertoire. Question every move and try to find better variations. This is how I learn new ideas and techniques, and it seems to work somehow. Please keep this in mind while you read this review.

* If you're interested, I'm sometimes writing about Go on my blog: http://mafutrct.wordpress.com/ and my Sensei's page: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Mafutrct]

;W[oe];B[pf];W[of];B[pg]C[Fourth line territory. I checked joseki dictionary and this result is considered good for black.

* Usually, black does not have a stone at M14. White I still think black is ok here, white is probably better than in the dictionary.

* Since white has the D14 cut, globally white seems fine. The direction is not very good for black. Black would like to stay connected rather.

* Chosing this variation, which is caused by M14 instead of simply securing the cut, is a preparation for the big white area on the top side, which is a main reason for black's loss.

* Even if this is actually good for black locally, white's stones are quite nicely working together.

* As a general principle: We hate to get disconnected, so try to avoid it if possible (or make sure you have some cool plan to handle it, if you really need to let white split you).]

(;W[oo]LB[pn:A][po:B][np:C]C[I'm not sure which direction would be better to answer locally. All groups seem to be rather strong, so I play tenuki.

* White probably thought (rightfully) he was behind, so he had to jump in this early. Black should try to keep the lead.

* Tenuki is too easy on white.

* There are many possible answers generally, and it's not easy to chose the correct one. The most common ones are certainly A, B or C.

* Since the right side is interesting, I guess black prefers A or B instead of C.

* Never tenuki in situations like this!]

(;B[dr]LB[ck:A][pn:C][cq:B]C[In retrospect I don't think this was such a good move, as white has two ways to settle his stones. Other side approach would have made things more natural for my rather weak group at left side. I also wanted to play C nobi soon.

* That you have to think about strengthening the F3 group is also caused by the K3 move in combination with your tenuki after P5.]

* I'm not sure about this move. White it does limit the top somehow, the right is too uninteresting to build it like this.

* Obvious shape defect at N13. If you have no plan for white's move, you cannot play this shape!

* If this move does not work... then just dont play it. :) Try to find an alternative. I usually count the scoren, decide how deep I need to go in, then I read to find the tactially best move. This becomes intuition pretty quickly.

* I think this the final game-losing move.];W[mg]C[* Good move.]

* Didn't check :P

* Of course, doing tsumego is always great. You probably know www.goproblems.com already.

* I liked your questions, they showed a certain insight.

* I recommend a review of basic principles. You're not bad at them, actually, but I think by studying the basics of the game again at this point in time you'll gain a perspective of your deficits in other areas. Once you understand what you should do (basics) and how you do it (actual games) and why it does not work sometimes (losses), you'll be able to study these aspects more intensely and leap forward more quickly. This also means it's easier for you to understand both strategic and tactical mistakes and punish them appropriately.

* That's all. I hope this review was helpful for you. :)])
