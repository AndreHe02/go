TM[900]RE[B+17.5]US[Brought to you by No Name Go Server]KM[0.5];B[cd]C[normally, black should play his first move in the upper right corner of the board. this is a minor point of ettiquette.]
;W[pp];B[dq];W[pc];B[qe];W[od];B[qh];W[fc];B[dc];W[ic];B[dh]C[b move at d12 may be a little thin? i prefer a little closer to corner, maybe at d13 or d14?]
;W[cn];B[cp];W[ck];B[qn];W[np];B[ip];W[kq];B[jq];W[kp];B[jp]C[Helaman 14k* : b gives up sente too easily here?

yes. k4 is inefficient. not only gives up sente, but makes an empty triangle, the proverbial example of bad shape.]
;W[fn];B[fp];W[bh]C[this (b12) or an invasion by w at c14 or d14 is the weakness of the d12 extension i mentioned earlier.]
;B[cf]C[almost purely a defensive move to save by connection the d12 stone. not much is gained on the upper left side. perhaps it is better for b just to treat this stone lightly and slide or invade into lower right corner.]
;W[ql];B[pm]C[b should r3 instead of q7, imho.];W[pl];B[om];W[qi];B[ri]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[ph];B[qg];W[rj];B[sh];W[oj]C[nice exchange for w. contact moves to strengthen both sides, but strengthening w at this point is more important. although p10 is light, maybe q10 would be better as far as eye shape is concerned . this is becaus of the the presence of the q8, r8 wall. if this wall were not present, then maybe p10 is called for. i prefer q10 over p10 in this situation. b can harrass at r10, then s9, etc.]
;B[qj]C[see?];W[pi];B[rk];W[rl];B[rm];W[of];B[ol];W[qk];B[sj];W[pj]C[Helaman 14k* : w wastes sente here?

yes, i think so.  more important is the lower right corner, and/or the upper side.]
;B[sl];W[if]C[nice moyo building move.];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp];W[ch];B[dg];W
[bo];B[bp];W[eb];B[db]C[nice series of sente endgame moves. w is lucky that b responded in every case. i think that the middle game is not over and that may be premature to play endgame plays. i think b should invade or reduce the large w moyo on top.]
;W[kr];B[qc];W[gq];B[gp];W[hs];B[hr]C[Helaman 14k* : i handled the monkey jump badly?

looks ok so far. b should expect this if he is going to ignore l2.];W[gs]
;B[gr];W[fs];B[fr];W[es]C[yes, i see what you mean. w is hemoraging into the b terr.]
;B[er];W[qb]C[not sure i understand this move. if w pressed the case at the bottom, why give up on it? b can now eat the 4 stones, albeit gote.]
;B[rb]C[Helaman 14k* : s18 another bad move.  should have just left it and j1?

perhaps.];W[qd];B[pb];W[rc];B[is];W[rq];B[ko];W[lo];B[kn];W[da];B[ca];W
[ea];B[cb];W[ff]C[w moyo getting harder and harder to invade or reduce now. b waiting too long.]
;B[ec];W[gb];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ef];W[di];B[fg];W[gf];B[ei];W[dj]
;B[ln];W[js];B[ir];W[mo];B[mn];W[hh]C[w moyo is now territory, and large.]
;B[jj];W[ob];B[lf]C[b too deep at m14. but, he has to try something.];W
[lh];B[mg];W[pe];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf];W[ng]C[i dont like this move by w. better would be n12 instead. wall b in. then eat him. drive b towards w thickness, not towards safety on the outside and friendly b stones!]
;B[mh];W[mf]C[another bad move by w. w should m11 instead or n12. the point is that w should capture b on a large scale not let him get away.]
;B[lg];W[nh]C[the 3rd bad move in a row by w. w was doing so well. too bad. w is reinforcing where she is already strong. the m12 stone gets weaker and weaker, and the n12 group gets stronger and stronger.]
;B[li];W[kh];B[mi]C[w handled this badly. w let b escape.];W[ld];B[me];W

[pk]C[Helaman 14k* : was w q9 necessary?

no. if all you wanted to do was save the r8 string, you could play ko at s10. dont be afraid of ko.the ko there on the right side effects the live-death status of the b group on the edge, so it is bigger for b than for w.]
;B[jg];W[ig];B[ii];W[ih];B[lj]C[now b has succeeded in drastically reducing the w moyo on top and cashed in on some large center terr of his own.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]C[valiant attempt, but futile.];B[fm];W[qm];B[rn];W[fo]
;B[go];W[gj];B[gk];W[on];B[pn];W[gi];B[fj];W[ae];B[bc]C[Helaman 14k* : any tighter way to handle this monkey jump?

yes, the proverb goes, "hit the monkey on the head." that means play at b15 instead. w has to pull back to connect. then you a16. and because of c16 stone, it is notnecessarily sente for w.]
;W[re];B[en];W[dn];B[eo];W[jd];B[co];W[bn];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[bf]
;W[af];B[bg];W[ag];B[nf];W[jf];B[ne];W[oe];B[oo];W[nd];B[mf];W[no];B[op]
;W[oq];B[po];W[mq]C[no. w should simply connect at q3. w is asking for trouble and a very large ko fight.

w does not need to fear the o3 cut after a q3 connection. just atari with n3 to the edge.]
;B[pq];W[pr];B[or]C[there it is. good for b.];W[pp];B[oi];W[og];B[pq];W
[rj]C[see the size of this ko at s10? i refered to it before. the life of the b group on the edge here is in jeapordy if w can take at t9 too.]
;B[nq]C[Helaman 14k* : was this the right time to seize the ko?


interesting. on the surface of it, it looks like a trade between the b group on the right side and the w corner bottom right. but also, w must now live around m3 etc.]
;W[sk];B[lp];W[sm]C[this trade is huge. i think b got the better of the deal. b gave up the s13 group, about 23 pts. w gave up the bottom right corner and side, about 45 pts. b gained twice as much as he gave up, about 23 pts net.]
;B[ek]C[Helaman 14k* : instead of e9, i should have r2 to complete the kill ?

no. w corner is dead as it stands unless b misplays. how can w live?];W
[qs];B[rr];W[nr];B[mp];W[os];B[mr]C[why ko? why not just p3 connect? if w n2 connect, then b just r2, double atari. w should not be able to live here.]
;W[oq];B[lq];W[pp]C[b has now given back what he gained in the previous exchange.]
;B[sq];W[qr];B[pq];W[sr];B[ss];W[rs]C[right. good for w.];B[or];W[sr];B
[ns];W[kf];B[gh]C[Helaman 14k* : h11 better than g12?

hard to say. little diff.];W[hi];B[ij];W[gg];B[fh];W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[cg]
C[Helaman 14k* : c13 ugly!  d9 is at least 1 move that would be better?

yes, c13 is dame and gote too. d9 is worth a point forcing w to fill inside.]
;W[sp];B[so];W[dk]C[d9 is big. not only protects w, but also threatens b with double atari. therefore it is double sente (sente for both sides).]
;B[el];W[sq];B[be];W[ps];B[bd];W[ah];B[dp];W[sl];B[sn];W[ji];B[oh];W[tt]
C[ i count 99 pts for b on the board plus 19 dead = 118? and 91 pts for w on the board plus 10 dead = 101? so, b wins by about 17 pts? was that the result you got?

w started out with a nice opening, but lost it in the middle game fighting.

w should have captured the invasion around m14 rather than let it get away. w made a bad trade by giving up the bottom for the right side, but then got lucky due to b mistakes and saved the corner after all!]
