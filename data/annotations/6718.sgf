C[Hi! It's the fist game I got reviewed. A really close one. I tried to comment the moves I wasn't sure about them or I think I didn't played the best I could. Hope you see it ok.]
;B[qd]C[Hi, I guess you are black right?];W[cp];B[dc];W[pp]
;B[qn];W[mp];B[qk]C[Black's playing here is too careful. Usually in opening, you should play at Q10 or R10. There's no need to worry about invasion at R8 as you can always play R3 to turn around. 

By the way, white playing at N4 is kinda questionable too. I rarely see people play that. It seems very loose. Maybe I am not good enough to understand the move.]
;W[fp]
(;B[ip]C[J4 invasion is too early. Don't invade too early, you invasion will enable your opponent to build a large frame work even if you manage to run out. 

Don't be jealous of the land that your opponent has. You can get your own share on the other side of the board too. Besides, the spacing of white stones are very loose and can be invaded later on anyway.

There's a lot of big points on the board. C15 is good.];W[jq]
C[You can just leave it your J4 stones there and get some other big points on the board, such as the C15. Lower right is not solid territory yet as there's R3 points for black to exploit. 

And there's a lot of trick to invade on the lower left too. 

I don't know about you, but my style is to make myself thick before doing any invasion. :)]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[jo]C[Hane at the head of 2 stones. Good.];W[ko]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[ho]C[Hmm. This move is a bit too much on the caution side. Maybe should just keep extending at K7. White can't cut at J5 for there's a ladder.]
;W[dm]C[That moves is a bit slow for white. The biggest point on board is still C15.]
;B[ck]C[A bit of overplay. White is stronger at the lower left and black get too closed to it. Black can get into trouble if white decide to attack at C11.]

(;W[cl];B[dk];W[ce]C[Now white is overplaying];B[cd];W[dh]
(;B[ch]C[Instead of this, black can play D15, a very thick move.]
;W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[di];W[eh];B[ei];W[fd]C[This seems to be bad for black. Black has more stone at the rhs, but now it's under attack.

Black played a bit too soft there.];B[fc];W[ed];B[ec];W[hc]

;B[ki];W[ni]C[So far left hand side seems good for black. 

By the way, M17 sente for black too. Should play it soon.];B[li]
;W[mh];B[qi]C[Hmm... This move is slow? 

Should attack at N9 area. Don't need to worry about LD of the left group as M17 is still there.]
;W[nk];B[ll];W[nm];B[fm]C[Now white connected back :(

Once white plays R4 the game is really hard for black.];W[fn]

;B[qq]C[After some small move, you finally got it :)];W[pq]
;B[qp];W[km];B[jl]C[I've always have a problem by stopping my opponent's atack. Sometimes I even get a little obsesed with that. This time I think I managed it well, but I would like to know if I could do better. (Also in move 87)]

;B[mr]C[Is there any better move? Could I take more points from there? Maybe B8 bigger.

This is bigger than B8. But Maybe T16 is bigger than both of them. 

Besides, play B9 instead of B8, b9 is sente.

I didn't comment much on your yose, but a lot of the moves both black and white did were pretty small. 

Should always get sente yose first.];W[lr];B[ls];W[nr];B[ms]

What you need is to work hard on the strategy part, and also try to figure out the strength of each groups. 

Another thing to work on is counting yose. 

The lessons of fundamental go by kageyama is a good book. Maybe you can try to get your hand on it. :)

Thank you. And may you get a stone stronger.])

If white block at E6, you can easily capture E8 stone.]))
