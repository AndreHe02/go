(;W[dm]C[Would a pincer here have been better play?

---

There's a simple guide here: "low stones are not interesting". In this position, f3 is low, AND q3 are low, so play away from them. It means that Black can't make much territory here anyway. On the other hand, D4 is high, and D16 are high, so they are interesting stones, and you should play near them.

So this is about the worst possible time for a pincer with your third move.

Remember these rules. They are simple, and helpful.];B[cq];W[dq]
C[it felt that I should separate black's position into two halves here, instead of trying to protect terrritory with C4

---

This is the wrong direction.

The reason is because you played d7, not d6. If you had d6, then playing c4 now would make you a very small position. With d7, if you play c4 you get a bigger position. So your d7 makes d4 a better move than otherwise. So much so, that Black c3 is probably wrong.

Also, when you play in this direction, and Black plays c4, Black's corner group has more space. Because d7 is further away, you are putting less pressure on Black than if you had d6.

So you should play c4 here, and make Black regret invading. Instead, what happened was that you played d3, and made Black happy to have invaded, and made yourself regret having played d7 instead of d6.]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[co]C[---

You can see now that you would rather have d7 at d6.];W[fp]
;B[iq]C[---

I think Black should ignore f4 (it's a small move) and play something like c7. j3 is a small move.]
;W[cp]C[This sequence felt wrong. My shape is heavy at the end, and didn't wind up with much territory as a result]
;B[bp]
(;W[bo]C[---

This is simply the wrong side to cut. See var.];B[bn];W[bq]
;B[ap]C[---

Black should simply capture.];W[do];B[cn]C[---

This is not a good exchange for you. You should simply leave it, and play b2. It will still be there later if you need it. (d5 would not be sente for Black.)]
;W[br];B[cl]
(;W[po]C[Here is the biggest question that I have about this game. Where is the proper area or direction of play?

I have sente and wanted to establish along the right side as it seemed big.

---

This is not the biggest question about this game. Any of the moves shown here would be reasonable. You should give more consideration to the other things I have said in this review. They are more important.

That said, I prefer q5 to the others here. q3, being on the 3-4 point, is inherently unsettled. q16, being on the 4-4 point, is inherently settled.]

;B[fc];W[ec];B[cf];W[fd];B[gc];W[ci]C[---

Again, you fail to recognise that low stones are not interesting.

You also fail to recognise the weakness at c17. It is weak from two directions (Black can connect from either direction.)

You should play c16 to seal the corner.

Because c14 is low, Black will get little territory on the side and it will be easy to reduce.]
;B[bd]C[---

Black should simply play c17 here. Now he has created two weak groups.]
;W[ei]C[---

This is an awful move. Black will have zero weak groups by playing c17. c11 is not even threatened. If you play c17 instead, Black can not kill c11. Even if he tried, you could leave it to die, and Black could only kill it on a small scale, spending many moves to make little territory. Now it is you who have two weak groups: around e16, and around d11.]
;B[cc]C[---

Perfect for Black.];W[gd];B[eb]
(;W[hd]C[---

j16 is better. See var.];B[hc];W[id]C[So by this point, my potential territory looks very small. I have a big moyo in the center that can be easily chipped away at until it is small.

I've given up three corners, two of which are very large. It seems like I'm in a losing position at the end of the opening here.

---

It's worse than you think. You don't have a moyo. Black r13, n4, c14, all stop this from qualifying as a moyo. You need to p13 at least to call this a moyo. Black should play something like o13 now, and have an easy, conservative win.]
;B[ef];W[ig]C[---

what is this? Do you think you are making territory? Do you think you are saving a weak group? Either way, you are wrong.

Try q17 instead. It is Black's main weakness, and you should be making complications now.]
;B[kq]C[---

This was Black's other weakness. But Black is incorrect to play here first.]
;W[qi]C[---

This is a missed opportunity. Black will get strong now.];B[qd]
;W[bl]C[---

Are you playing "lucky dip"?];B[bk];W[ck];B[bm];W[al];B[ak]
;W[bj]C[---

This is the wrong forcing move. It should be d8, to make you solid.]
;B[am];W[qo];B[rp];W[mo];B[np];W[lo];B[nk]C[---

Black doesn't need to go this far. o13 would be perfect.];W[oh]

An interesting game to review.

You lost this game because you did not undesrtand the correct "direction of play" in the opening.

You also lost because you made moves that were not necessary, and let your groups become weak, and missed opportunities to create weak groups to attack. This is the most important.

But you won this game in the end, because Black, even though he was winning, overextended, invaded too deep, and additionally made an awful mistake that resulted in the loss of the biggest group on the board. These kinds of mistakes are inexcusable, and if you make one, you lose no matter how well you played the opening or the middle game.
