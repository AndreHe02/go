C[Hellow, dear reviewer, and thank you very much in advance for taking your time to review this game.
In this game I play white. This is my first game as KGS 1 dan. It's short and  I lost it badly, after dying in opponents moyo. Still I hope to patch some my bad habbits with the help of this game.
I've added some questions and thoughts to the game (starting with "Cr1"), but please, feel free to coment whereever you find it necessary. Thanks again for help!

;B[qn];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[qk];W[nc];B[kd];W[qc]TR[qk][qn]C[Cr1: playing r17,  I thought, that with the marked stones low, black wall wouldn't be very effective and white will be able to reduce later with q10. Is this the right way of thinking? If not, what was the  better joseki for white?

klin: r17 ok];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[nd];B[ne];W[me]C[Cr1: yeah, I'm very weak with josekies : (  maybe it was better to protect the cutting-point with p17?]
;B[md]LB[mb:B][mc:A]TR[oc]C[Cr1: was it better to play A or B instead of p17?

klin: p17 best, B ok, A bad.];W[oc];B[nf]C[Cr1: I thought, that cutting at m16 immediately isn't a good idea, because it will make black stronger. But without this cut local result seems very bad for white. Could you show pleas, where did the things went wrong?

klin: W not bad.  W gets sente.];W[cf];B[df]C[klin: B D14 good move.  Therefore, W C14 can consider playing at D14.]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[cj];B[eg]C[klin: B E13 bad.];W[dh]
;B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]LB[eg:A][dh:B]TR[de]C[Cr1: now black has a really huge moyo, so I thought, that taking a big poing at j4 is too slow and  I invaded instead. I see, that after A-B ecxhange black has some weaknes around d15, but how to exploit it?

Maybea it was better to start with the move around f17 and then, if black protects the cutting poing, jump to j17?

klin: W can D15 cut now.  If B gives up the corner, it is very big.]
;W[ic]C[klin: W J17 too deep.];B[gc]LB[gc:B][ic:A]C[Cr1: heh, now I see, that A-B exchange helps black to protect d15 cutting-point, so it's bad for white.]
;W[ie];B[ig];W[gd]C[Cr1: g17 looks strong enouth to lean on it.]
;B[fc];W[fd]C[klin: W F16 not good.  Should H13 tryto get out.]
;B[ed];W[ke]C[Cr1: now white stones are in trouble :(];B[jd]
C[klin: W has to connect at K15.];W[id];B[je];W[jf]C[Cr1: I misread this variation.]
;B[if];W[lf]C[klin: W M14 should M16];B[mf];W[ld];B[lc];W[kc]

[eg][gg][ig]C[Cr1: living this way is very paintful for white. But maybe it's still possible to neutralize a bit black's great wall influence?

klin: W could have resigned at the point.];B[fq];W[dn]C[Cr1: was it better to gain some thickness playing pincer instead of d6?]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[kq]C[Cr1: now this move looks like the wrong direction. But what was the right one?
During the game I considered q10, k4 or q8.];B[mp];W[np];B[mo]
;W[mq];B[on];W[kk];B[mk];W[hp];B[hq];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[gq]
C[Cr1: at this point I counted, that white has around 60 points and black has at list 80. So I'm trying to make my own moyo on the left and to reduce black's moyo at the same time. Crazy idea, but was there any other way to win?]
;W[fi];B[hj];W[gk];B[il];W[km];B[ko];W[ki]C[Cr1: maybe j7 was better to make my stones alive?

klin: L 11 should K6];B[jn]C[klin: It is hrad for W to make two eyes in there.  W could try J9, K8, then J10 to see if there is a chance. 
No comments after this point.];W[mj];B[lj];W[lk];B[li];W[ml]

;B[mi];W[mh];B[ni]C[Cr1: I wasn't lucky enough to make 2 eyes and resigned at this point. I know, that I made alot of mistakes in this game, but I hope to learn something from them.
Thanks again for the review!])
