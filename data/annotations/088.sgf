C[
if playing with handicap stones, i would try to play less  agressively. Maybe something like f/g 17 ?]
;W[df];B[fd];W[dh];B[ci]C[I think,  this move is too small. You don't gain much from this one.
I'd have played at k17 or even j17 to secure the left upper  corner.];W[gg]
(;B[ch]C[This is similiar to my last comment. Still a stone in  the middle at
the top would make a large territory.
Another good move is at c 6/7 to get terr. at the right side.

(if your playing against a stronger opponent try to keep
the game simple, defending the advantages you got from the
handicap stones)];W[hd](;B[gc];W[hc]
C[Playing at the left sind at c6/7 makes  a large territory....](;B[eh]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[hf](;B[jd]C[As the white stones  are already pretty strong this move seems
to me much too agressive. You could have attacked their base with
a move at M17. This would have allowed you to either play at O17
if you were attacked from the left or to strengthen them with  j17 if white attacks from the right.]
;W[md];B[nc];W[mc];B[ne]C[maybe just o16  to get less cuts open ...];W[nd]
;B[od];W[me];B[nf];W[pg];B[mf]C[What was the  aim of this move ?
With this move you force white to close your way to the middle
with the k16 stone, making it even more difficult to rescue.
Another possibility would be to take the upper right corner
by playing at r14.

Still a move C6/7 is very valueable];W[le];B[jf];W[lf](;B[mh]
C[this looks  inconsequent to me. If you want to save K16/14
you have to continue their escape to the middle. These stones are
pretty valueable because they would destroy the white territory  at the top.]
;W[kg];B[jg];W[kh];B[hh];W[gh](;B[fg]
C[in this situation I'd  prefer to play at k12 (maybe j12) to get  the middle stones out of the white surrounding.]
;W[ff];B[gi];W[hi];B[hg];W[gf]C[You should have sacrificed the one stone at g11. If you play
the atari at j11 to save your middle stones.](;B[gj]
C[,,,];W[ii]C[now the  black stones at the k line are cut off and get killed ...]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[di]C[this move is too small again ...
playing at c 6/7/8 is much more valueable.];W[oi];B[dg];W[ef];B[jp];W[fq]

(;B[jk]C[I'd prefer playing at o3. This would attack the white corner
and acquire some territory in the bottom middle.];W[kk];B[kj];W[ki]
C[After  white connected his stones at j11 and l13 the black stones in the middle are  irrevertible dead. So leave them and try to get
new territory. I'd like o3 or r14.
You even might play at r7.];B[lj];W[li];B[mi];W[mj];B[lk];W[nj](;B[nl]
C[As  the right side is still very open you could have played
directly at r8. It would have probably been possible to build
up a living group there.];W[qe];B[qd];W[oe](;B[of]
C[I'm not quite shure about  this, but it looks to me as if there
is no way to rescue the black stones at o14 and n12. So maybe  you should have played at q15 instead of p14 and extend your corner
territory to the middle right side.];W[pe];B[pf];W[qf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh]
;W[rh];B[ph];W[og];B[oh];W[qi]C[playing at o11 might have saved some of your  stones !

It creates a shape which might allows to get two eys by playing at  o13. If white plays at o13 you have an atari move at q11
which gives you some opportunities to get the groups q12 and n11  out of the white surrounding.]
(;B[pi];W[pj];B[nh];W[qk];B[ri]
C[Leave the  situation as it is, if you don't see a real chance to
get out. Not giving up some already captured stones normally
increases the damage even more. (At least from my experiences)];W[qj];B[re]
C[Just try to invade the white right side by playing at q7. Or just play my  favorite move at o3.]
