C[forfun (hereafter ff) - In this game Black played very actively but nevertheless ended up losiing. Why was that? I believe there were two basic reasons:
- First, as soon as White invaded the right side and the fighting started Black seemed to think only about attacking White's stones. No real attempt was made to play a strategic game. Black seldom seems concerned with making territory. We always need to remember that Go is a game about territory. Attacking is a vital tool, however, the game is won by the player with more territory in the end.
- Second, Black showed very little regard for all the weaknesses in his own position created during the running fight in the early middle game. Go is about balance. Attacking hard is pointless if our opponent can counterattack and live profitably based on weakenesses that we leave behind due to overconfidence.

The Go board is wide and our games are normally long. If we are playing someone about our own strength, we should seldom play games that are decided by a single fight. We should always be looking around the board as a whole and assessing whether we are prepared for the next stage of the game, which will be a new fight over there, or maybe over here...]
;B[pp];W[qe];B[dd];W[dp];B[fq]C[ff - More typical would be to approach the upper right at Q17 or P16. Basically, since the White 4-4 stone on D4 is facing Black 4-4's in both the upper left and the lower right, it does not seem so urgent to settle the direction here. Disputing the upper right seems more important right now. But we can not say the F3 is actually bad.]
;W[cf]
(;B[fc]C[ff - This seems rather passive after White decided to ignore F3. See the variations, somehow Black might want to put more pressure on White.]
;W[cj]C[ff - White goes a long way toward connecting up on the left side. It feels like Black has missed a chance here.]
;B[jp];W[dr]C[here I thought it was to early to attack around c6, and if I played f5 w would ensure a big side.
So I headed towards the right side to make a broad formation.
What do you think about it?

-What about r12/12?

-Is it necessary to approach p/q 17?

ff - This seems like an overplay by White. The normal D6 would make a good formation on the left side. Here White has invasion points left with only small compensating benefit from D2. Black does not have to rush in since White can not fix all problems with only one more play.

For Black's next, if Black plays R12, we should expect White to answer with Q17, protecting the corner. If that happens, what is Black's next play? I think the play at R10 in the game showed a better sense of balance. 

If Black approaches in the upper left, what do we expect White to do?

The choice in the game seemed reasonable to me.]
(;B[pj];W[od]C[ff - This loose enclosure leaves behind easy invasion points in the corner. White clearly aims to invade the right side.]
(;B[fo]C[ff - Thinking time 29 seconds. Black wants to take advantage of the White formation on the left side. You considered it on the previous play and now you talk yourself into it. However, since the C10 stone is low, White can not really fix up the side with only one more stone. Black should probably give priority to the right side.]
(;W[ql]C[What about, instead: covering (p8 or so) to push towards the corner and make b solidify territory there?]
(;B[qn]C[Maybe this r6 is to much in a hurry to make points, and weakends q10

ff - After White P16 (outward oriented) and F5 (building in the center) it seems like it would be interesting to force White into the side. See the variation...]
;W[ol]C[ff - Now Black and White run out together and it is not clear who is strong and who is weak.]
(;B[nj];W[ml];B[lj]
(;W[rj]C[ff - This looks too early...];B[nm]C[ff - Not a good idea when the Black stones above are unsettled. This only strengthens White.]
;W[nl];B[ri]C[Is the cut dangerous?

ff - I think your first variation shows that Black will struggle if White answers with R10 here and cuts. The meaning of White's formation with P16 and R15 is that it is closer to any fighting than a normal shimari on P17 and R16. Black should  realize that the White corner is vulnerable behind those stones. So Black does not have to fight so hard in the narro space in front.]
(;W[rk]
(;B[qh]C[What about this move? I think I saw it in stronger players' games. It looked like working here (to prepare eyeshape), but maybe it has some weakness?

ff - This seems like a move where Black feels weaker than White locally. That is not the case here. Black is further into the center than White...]
;W[kl];B[lm]C[ff - Same problem as the last peep. Black is helping White here.]
;W[ll];B[jk]C[ff - Looks too aggressive. Black's stones have too many weakenesses to hope to capture White.]
(;W[jl];B[il];W[im]C[ff - White helps Black a little here. It seems more appropriate to just start cutting Black apart with L10 directly.]
;B[hl];W[jn]
(;B[hm]
(;W[hn]C[ff - See variation...];B[io];W[in];B[fm]C[is the sequence all right?

ff - If you are not going to continue with G6, you should not play H7 in the first place.]
;W[pn]
(;B[qo]C[this one seemed the safer move - which helped w the less
- is there better?

ff - It does not really matter. Black is too weak here. Basically Black has created a situation where White is very strong and well positioned to take advantage of Black cutting points. This play is good in that it protects Black's corner.]
;W[gn]
(;B[fn]C[e8 instead to prevent the cut?
(but e8 would give several sente moves to w & help protect the corner, no?)

Perhaps better to play like this, solid, and take care of the cut later?]
;W[nn];B[pk]C[ff - This move takes away some eye potential for White but strengthens White further while doing so. Black should play elsewhere.]
;W[pl];B[np];W[kj]
(;B[jj]C[right move?

ff - White's last is an attacking move. I think it is impossible to kill White now. Black should play from the weaker stones, in this case the right side stones. See variation.]
;W[ki];B[kk];W[lk];B[li]
(;W[kh];B[lh];W[kg]
(;B[cn]C[I thought w would answer. And if not, since m8 is likely alive, loosing a few stones in the center does seems as big.
 What do you think?

ff - Basically I can't fault really fault Black for playing a supposed forcing play - we all make that mistake often enough. If only those pesky opponents would answer when they are supposed to... :)

But overall Black is relying on "forcing" plays here, there, everywhere. There does not seem to be an overall plan here. Where is White weak? Has Black built strong stones nearby in order to punish White? Where is Black weak? Is White going to be able to punish Black for that weakness? See the variation...]
(;W[hj]C[is there a good way to defend?

ff - Basically Black has left too many weaknesses behind in rushing around the board. Now Black will pay the price.]
(;B[fk];W[ik]
(;B[cq]C[ff - This is certainly not a small move, but the other fights on the board are larger.]
;W[lg]
(;B[qf]C[o12 better?

ff - White is unlikely to be so kind as to attach like in your variation. This expands your eyeshape better and would have given a reasonable result without your mistake.]
;W[pf];B[rf]
(;W[pg]C[ff - Looks like the wrong direction. The M13 stones are very strong due to the J9 cut, White should look to the corner now. Black is not going to friendly enough to die here, his shape is too good.]

(;B[jc]C[ff - What else did Black consider at this point? White is very thick in the center.]

(;B[bd]C[ff - Again Black does not take into consideration his own weaknesses. Black spent one minute 15 seconds on this play, probably the longest thinking time of the game. What did Black consider and why choose this? Your variation of C15 is the usual approach.]
;W[ce];B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[ed]
(;B[ec];W[de];B[fd];W[db];B[eb]C[very bad move, no?
now w a17]
(;W[el];B[fl];W[gp]C[I didn't see what was coming ahead...

ff - Notice how Black is following White around:
- When White attacked the right side, Black ended in gote so that White was able to play H3.
- When Black responded to H3 he ended in gote again so that White was able to play C16.
- In responding to C16, Black ended in gote again so that White is the first to play in the bottom left.

However, G4 is actually a poor choice. White's ability to play at F2 or E3 is extremely important for the lower left corner. Black should seize the opportunity to fix up the defects in his shape. See the variation...]
