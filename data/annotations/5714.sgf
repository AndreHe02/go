C[I'm White. In this game it felt like I missed the point in a few places. I'd like to hear your viewpoint on this game, especially on the middlegame and control of the center.

I won this game but it felt like I got lucky in a few places -- I didn't feel in control of the game, more like I just stumbled into the win.

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt.  I'm 2dan at the local club which means I'm too weak to tell you what the correct moves are, but maybe I can give you ideas what to think about.
Please use an sgf reader that displays variations properly - cgoban1, qgo, jago, gGo, glGo all work, but cgoban2 (the KGS client) has some problems.
Since you added a number of variations already, I've marked the ones I added with "(*)"]
;B[dd];W[cp];B[pd];W[qp];B[jd];W[cf];B[be]LB[dj:A][fc:B]C[How to respond?

crux: With Black playing on the second line, you could locally consider your stone light - even if it's captured the loss is probably not too large.  Black's move is territorial but leaves aji.  I'd probably dodge away to A; you could also consider a second approach move at B trying to force B to defend his corner territory.]

(;W[dj];B[ch];W[bf]TR[cf]LB[fc:A]C[crux: I'd probably still not place too great an importance on this stone.  Instead of the game move, how about a play on the upper side around A?  Black still can't capture the marked stone without leaving weaknesses that you can exploit later.]
;B[ce]
(;W[df];B[eh]
(;W[ed]LB[ff:A]C[crux: This helps Black solidify his corner.  Maybe just play at A instead?]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[de];B[cc];W[ff];B[gh];W[hf];B[hd];W[gd]
;B[hc];W[gc]C[crux: Liberties are usually worth more than the one point or so you gain with this move.]
;B[gb];W[gj];B[ej]
(;W[di];B[dh];W[dk];B[gg];W[gf];B[oq]LB[jg:A]C[crux: I think it is slightly too early to tenuki from the fight in the top left - for both players.  I won't mention this at every move, but keep it in mind - A seems like a nice point for either side to surround the other.]
;W[lp];B[qr];W[op]LB[eq:B][qj:A]C[It feels like this is the shape point. Any other ideas?

crux: Locally this seems like the best point.  It's worth considering whether Black's low move needs an immediate answer.  You might simply extend towards A which is a nice point on the side.  Or you could start moyo-building by enclosing the other corner at B.]
;B[pq];W[pp];B[np]
(;W[qq]LB[nq:B][rr:A]C[crux: This just seems bad.  It seems like it's played to make the cut at B work, but Black could protect there now while getting what I'd consider a reasonable result (see variation).]

(;W[do];B[dn];W[eo];B[en];W[fp];B[ek];W[fi]LB[el:A][gl:B]C[With my top group not entirely alive I guess I shouldn't start a fight here.

crux: This also eliminates most of the aji left in the three white stones.  I'd try to think about how to make the hane at A work.  How about a white stone at B?
Generally, a move like this should only be played if you can see clearly that it's going to lead to a good result.]
