C[Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1 (not solid 10k on KGS)

It was a friendly game and i was trying to do my best, but still lose it.

I would like to know which mistakes i have done in the beginning of the game (fuseki mistakes, direction of play, forms).
Another thing i would like to know what i should do with "moyo reduction moves" in the top of the board in tuban (i feel that there were too much mistakes and black could protect moyo better)

There is some comments in the game tree with my thoughts about situation

Thanks for your time and sorry for my awfull english :)

Kurato1 [10k\]: have fun


Hi Kurato1,

I'm Felix your reviewer. I'll preceed my comments with "F:".
I added detailed commentary and variations to point out your mistakes and answer your questions. Please do not hesitate to contact me, if you have further questions. Allthough you got behind in this game, you several times had the chance to come back. It was probably due to a lack of concentration in the late night hours, that you could not read out the correct sequences. So improving your reading abilities in general will help you a lot.

Best regards,
Felix
a.k.a. Djif-Master on KGS];B[cp];W[pp];B[pd];W[dc];B[np]C[F: The high approach move is unusal in this situation in my opinion. The high approach is usually played, when it is advantageous to play on the side (here bottom side). This is not the case, because there is still enough room for White to invade easily. Locally the high approach move invites a loss.
If you do not have a special reason, I would always prefer the low approach move at 'A'.
On the other hand I must admit, this is NOT the game losing move. It is just slightly unfavorable and the possible continuations are probably more difficult than the continuations after the low approach.]
;W[kp]LB[pn:D][jp:B][lp:A][pq:C]C[F: I only found 'A' or 'B' in the joseki dictionaries. But the idea is the same. The pincer immediatly attacks the black stone. That is also the reason why you want to play the high approach with support (moyo) in the bottom left.
'C' and 'D' are the joseki moves here. 'C' is leaning on White to create possible cutting points, 'D' is changing directions, trying to build something on the right.]
(;B[pn]C[here i don't know how to play

F: This move is good for a start.];W[oo]
(;B[no]LB[on:A][qq:B]TR[pn]C[F: This move is a typical double digit kyu mistake I guess. White will naturally answer at 'A'. This hurts the marked black stone. If you defend there, White turns and is attacking two black groups at the same time.
So you always want to avoid pushing the enemy stones against your own WEAK groups.
Playing at 'A' instead of this move results in a similar situation.
So where to play
'B' is the correct answer here. See variation.]
(;W[oq]LB[on:A]C[F: White should split the groups at 'A' instead.]
;B[on]LB[nn:A]C[I feel it is not a best choise, too heavy

F: This is actually not the worst result for you. The problem is, that the cut at 'A' remains. You should defend this cut as soon as you can.]
;W[eq]LB[mm:A]C[F: It may seem slow, but defending your weakness at 'A' is very urgent. If you do not defend, it will hunt you later.]
;B[ep]LB[dn:B][do:A]C[F: This move is possible, but generally I would not recommend it. Because it allows your opponent to settle easily. Try to experiment with the standard answers 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[fp];B[eo];W[dq];B[cq];W[gn];B[em]LB[ck:C][dl:D][hp:B][fq:A]
C[im not sure here, would c7-c8 be better?

F: I like this move, because White left a weakness at 'A'/'B' behind. If you invade the bottom later, this move helps you. On the other hand, it will be difficult to answer a white move at 'C', so 'D' might be a good alternative.]
;W[ce]LB[mm:A]C[F: Now really is the time to protect your cut at 'A'. After that the white stones on the bottom will be a very easy target. See variation.]
(;B[jc];W[cj]TR[em]C[F: Now the downside of the high black stone is exploited...]
(;B[cl]LB[qf:C][fq:B][cr:A]C[F: Usually defending territory at such a small scale is not a good choice. Locally I would defend the Black group at 'A' treatening the cut at 'B'.
But overall I'm more inclined to play 'C', building a huge moyo at the right and the top.]
;W[ej];B[dg]LB[gc:B][qf:D][dg:C][mm:A]C[g17 instead?

F: I still think, that defending at 'A' would be best. Besides that, you worry to much about your opponent making territory. The question is not 'B' or 'C' (which is locally better), but if not 'D' is better to play, making territory your own.]
;W[gc];B[ee]LB[fg:A]TR[cj][ej]C[F: A simple jump to 'A' would be better, because it threatens to disconnect and attack the marked white stones.]
;W[gf]C[F: Now it is you, who gets attacked.];B[fg];W[ef];B[df]
LB[eg:A]TR[cj][ej]C[F: I think connecting at 'A' is better. The reason behind is the same as before, you try to attack the marked white stones.]
;W[eg];B[eh]TR[de][dh][fh]C[F: Now you got cutting points all over.]
;W[ff];B[ch]LB[di:A][gi:B]C[F: I think a peep at 'A' would not be bad in this situation. You force White to connect and can jump to 'B' after that.]
;W[fh]
(;B[dj]LB[fi:A]C[F: This move is rarely a good move. It is only played, if you really want to cut the connection between the white stones. But here you do not cut anything important. And I doubt that it works at all (see variation after move 39). I prefer 'A' over this move. See variation.]
;W[di];B[dk]
(;W[dh]LB[ci:A]C[F: I think White should connect at 'A'.
Like this Black is lucky.];B[ci];W[ei];B[bg]C[F: This result was unexpected, Black is very lucky.]
;W[de];B[ed];W[ec];B[pj]LB[mc:A][nn:B]TR[ec][gc][ef][ff][gf]
[eg][fh][ei]C[F: White could build up a lot of influence, so Black needs to defend against an invasion on the top with 'A'. At the same time, there is still the cut at 'B'. So Black has more than just one problem.]
(;W[qc]C[F: This invasion is not good for White. It actually helps Black. See variation.]
;B[qd]C[F: This is the right side to defend.];W[pc];B[od]LB[oc:A]
[qf:B]C[F: Black usually plays 'A'. You probably mixed it up, with a pincer joseki, where White has a stone at 'B', then this move would be correct.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ph]
(;B[qh]LB[nj:A]TR[mc][nc][od][pd][qd][re][qf]C[F: Defending like this is bad style. You just build up a huge wall. You have to use this strenght and push you opponent against it! Try something like 'A' next time. See variation.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[oj];B[ok]TR[nn]C[Is nidan bane playable here? im not sure i play correct here

F: Generally speaking the double hane is correct, but it is the possible cut, where the trouble comes from.]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl];B[pl];W[ml];B[mk];W[nn]C[F: Finally White found the cut.]
(;B[lo]LB[qq:A]C[F: Running away like this is not a good idea, because White will probably profit. Another idea is to play 'A' using the aji left in the corner.]
;W[km]LB[mn:A]C[F: I think White should play 'A' instead, Black will have a hard time.]
(;B[lm]LB[mn:A]C[F: This move only helps White to defend against his weaknesses. Your opponents move, is your move, so you should play 'A'.]
;W[ll];B[kl];W[ln]
(;B[nm]C[My opponent give me advice to play n6 instead of o7, but later in yose o7 looks like good move.

ORBix [8k\]: but u put here
ORBix [8k\]: do u see?
Kurato1 [10k\]: yea

F: N6 is indeed better. Now it is not about yose, it is about to connect your stones! The next thirty moves are forced, because you did not connect here. It is thirty moves struggling for life. It is also the beginning of White getting a huge corner, because he could chase you around.]
;W[mn];B[kn];W[jm];B[nq]LB[qq:A]C[F: Now I definitely would recommend 'A' instead.]

F: You are right, the white stones should be captured. Because you have an empty triangle like shape, you have to be very careful. Starting with 'A' as in the game is wrong, 'B' is the solution. But you have to read carefully.]

here i feel i lose lots of points.

F: The white stone is nicely placed. Usually you want to cap such a move with something like 'A' so that he cannot escape. But here it won't work, because White has supporting stones and influence.
You could try to play 'B', hoping that White will connect at 'C' and then cap with 'A'. But if I would play against you, I would simply ignore your move at 'B' and play 'A' myself.]
