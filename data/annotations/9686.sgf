C[So the key mistake you made in this game was to allow white to claim so much of the bottom of the board. This might not have mattered if you managed to get a big kill, but it's important to see the big picture on the board. I tried to focus more on the big ideas than individual variations, because there weren't a lot of small mistakes you didn't already catch. The big picture is probably one of the toughest things for beginners, but I hope I can give you some insight into it through my review.]

;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[od];B[mb]C[Don't really know why I did this.... thought to block

--------------------
I think this is a fine move right here. White will probably live eventually, but it's good to frisk him a bit. As white works to live, you'll secure your position on the right, and hopefully build influence for controlling the top.]
;W[nb];B[mc]C[Hane instead at O19?
-------------------
No this is definitely better. It's rarely a good move to go towards the edge of the board, white will take that opportunity to enclose you.]

C[This move surprised me. More on this in a little.];W[le];B[lf]
;W[lc];B[ke];W[lb];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[ma];B[ka]C[This play is your first big mistake.  You're not threatening white, and at most you will gain a few points of territory in the top right.  

Remember that move you made at C6. White ignored it because he was afraid you would kill him on the top right. Then this sequence happened, and should have left you with Sente. You needed to use that Sente to make him pay for ignoring you in the bottom left. Maybe something like F3.]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[co];B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[bn];W[eo];B[dn]
;W[go];B[dk]C[This is a big moment in the match. It's the point where a player needs to think about his long term strategy for the game.

So at this point it should be clear that white has strong hold on the bottom of the board. If you can maintain the entire top left quarter, you can match his points. This requires being aggressive and really sealing the top left off, counting on your walls at D6 and K17, and your strong stones near the top left star to help kill any white invasions.

But a move like D9 resigns yourself to losing most of the center. You picked staying safe on the left. This is fine, but now you desperately need to reduce white along the bottom. I would to the next chance to dive into his territory at say J3.]
;W[ed];B[dd];W[ee]C[White is getting greedy here. You need to get the kill here. Ideally you push him down, and make some natural moves around G7 which both block white, and give you some leverage for attacking the bottom.]
;B[df];W[de];B[cf];W[ef];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[ei];B[ej]C[This is a nice sequence of moves here. Look at how good your shape is! And you've effectively blocked white's run to the bottom. White does have some size, but he's sealed in by good shape on both flanks. If white tries to live up top, kill him. If he tries to run to the bottom, chase him, and use this opportunity to build influence for an attack on the bottom.]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[gc]C[Remember how I complimented your shape witha  move at E10? Well white has done the same here. Notice how he now has a shot at an eye around F16, and possibly one along the top edge.]
;B[fa];W[ga]C[I've given away sente here....
----------------------
Good insight. Keeping sente is vital in a fight. Be careful about little moves like this.]
;B[ea];W[ic];B[ha]C[A silly exchange here, should have realised that white wall wouldn't have been beat]

(;B[gd]C[Don't resign yourself here to giving white some eyes. There are a lot of ways to keep this fight going, though you have to be careful to keep your middle group alive. There are countless variations to follow, but I posted some rough outlines.]
;W[fb];B[ie];W[ja];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg];W[fh];B[fj]C[Perhaps a bigger jump?
--------------------
More important is to ask "what am I trying to accomplish here?" 

This stone looks to me like a move to seal white in. In general we like to do that, but there is no territory in the middle anymore, so it's really need worth the trouble. I think the pressing mvoe is to attack the bottom.]

C[Should have extended from the hane to H12 I think];W[hh];B[jg]
;W[ih];B[hj];W[jh];B[kg];W[kh];B[lg]C[This move is unecessary and makes bad shape. If you want to play here, play at m12, but it's more pressing to play elsewhere.]
;W[lh];B[mh];W[ge];B[jf]TR[kd][le]C[Also uncessary. I think you panicked about this middle shape, but it's had two eyes for awhile now.]

;B[hi];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[ik];B[hk]C[Moves like this are just helping white seal in his territory on the bottom.]

;W[ho];B[im];W[jm]C[At your level, moves like this are worth giving a try. You never know what might happen. But against a quality player, this game is over.]
;B[in]
(;W[jn]C[I think at this point it's worth asking "what did white fundamentall do wrong on the bottom?"

This is what happens when you try and attack too close to your enemy. Each move he makes only makesyou longer and more dangerous. The line down to J4 essentially becomes a wall of influence, which you then leveraged against the left. 

Attacking should be like casting a big net around your opponent. Reduce the area he has to work with, and wait to play next to his stones until you're playing at a critical eye killing spot.]
