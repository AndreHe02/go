C[Felisratus: Hello, dear reviewer. Thanks for taking your time to review this game. It's one of my first DGS games. I tried to experiment with some new oppenings, so this game was very untypical for me. But it was really nice and interesting.
I've added some thoughts and questions during the game, but please feel free to comment whenever you see some problems or better moves.
Please review for both sides!
Thanks again!

/Igor' (Felisratus)

Ken (Sumiyaka):  I'd like to thank the reviewer too.];B[qd]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pp]C[Felisratus: ehh... I rarely play diagonal fuseki, especially as W. In this game W got very big bottom moyo, but a few solid points in the upper-left, and B got lot of territory. So the game looked really unbalanced.
Maybe you will be able to suggest some more "garmonic" moves for W?

Sumiyaka: This is the opening I have been toying with the most lately.]

(;B[er]C[CC  fancy... but is it good?  see var.];W[dp];B[cq]
;W[fr];B[do];W[ep]C[Sumiyaka:  I don't think the that sequence was joseki.  At least not any I know :).  I debated c2 next, but wasn't sure if it was big enough to be sente.  This is why I left corner.  I was also interested that G3 had all its liberties.  I was hoping that could be handy later (alas it wasn't)

CC  -- You are right about C2 being too small... and because white has such a strong wall there... G3 is not very useful -- you are making white too strong here...]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[dj];W[qj];B[jc];W[bd]LB[qg:A][pn:C][nq:B]C[Felisratus: Is it too slow?
Maybe W should play one of the marked moves (r13, o3 or q6) instead?

Sumiyaka:  I don't know the answer to W's question, but I was happy to have sente.


CC  it is kind of small... i like A or B more... but it is an ok move.. because it lets you invade the left side easily]

(;B[nq]LB[qh:B][oj:C][np:A]C[Felisratus: B now has quite alot of solid points. Maybe he must think about maintaining of territory/influence balance and play high approach (o4)?
Another big move, forming two-wing formation, is r12

Sumiyaka:  Interesting thought.  Looking at the points marked a M3 looks interesting to me, and Q6.  O4, I am not as sure about.  I felt that R12 would just induce white to play P10 next, which I wanted to avoid.  Thoughts?


CC  playing at O3 here seems great... playing the B to C exchange first would be ok too]

(;W[lq]LB[pn:B][lq:A]C[Felisratus:
 I don't think, that q6/r6 will be good for W, because after the variation below, B makes strong group, that devaluates W thikness on the left side.

Sumiyaka:  Yes I considered that variation, and would have loved to play it :)]
;B[qq]C[Sumiyaka:  I considered jumping to the middle with O5.  Its not something I do much, unless I'm white in handicap games.  Is it a better way to play here to breakup white a little bit.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[rn]TR[qn]C[Felisratus:
 r6 is the joseki move here. It prevents W from pressing B down to the 2nd line and also has good "anti-moyo" follow-up (r7 or o7).
S6 it too low.

Sumiyak: Thank you. Noted.

CC  too true];W[qm];B[qh]LB[kn:A]TR[fm][en]C[Felisratus:
 Really big point for B. But maybe pressing down W's moyo with something like e6 or f7 is even bigger?
By the way, should W have played r13 instead of r7?

Sumiyaka:  I would like to know thoughts between creating the double wing at the top and playing in the lower left also.  I debated it a while.


CC  i think this move is fine... playing the triange isn't really that great... beacuse you dont have much of a frame work o the left..  if you want to reduce the white moyo... i would just go for something around A]
;W[cl];B[ck]C[CC  bad move i think -- lets white break up your territory if he just stands with D8... white would have been best for him see variation]

(;W[em]C[CC  standing may be better but you are going for big moyo which is fine if thats your style... but you are giving away alot of points to black for an extra couple stones to add to your wall in gote]
;B[dl];W[en];B[dm];W[fk];B[kk]C[Felisratus: And now the most interesting part of this game begins. I've counted, that if W passively defends at l7 and B develops his upper-right framework, then W will lose with a great margin. So W have to play actively, even if it looks like overplay. I'll be grateful for any suggestions about the ongoing fight.

Sumiyaka:  This was the move I thought the most about.  I knew white shouldn't be allowed to just get the entire bottom half of the board.  But I was unsure the best point to play to reduce white's potential.  I considered most of the moves next to tengen.  I chose this one because it was one of the deepest, and I felt far enough away from white's stones.  From what I could read I had enough room to run.

CC  this should be fine for black...];W[ki]C[CC see var]
(;B[ji];W[jh];B[jj];W[ih];B[kh]C[CC  this looks like an overplay for black -- i would play a less aggression variation like the one i showed on move 46]

(;W[jf];B[hf];W[if];B[hg]
(;W[le]C[CC looks like a mistake
     i would rather attack the H12 stones while you ahve the opportunity 

you have a lot of possible attacks here -- the net that i show in variation is a good possibility -- leaning on the k17 stone will be good in any cause because it will strengthen your group without helping blacks 2 weak groups]
;B[mg];W[ff]C[CC here you are playing fromthe wrong direction ... you shouldn't play from your stronger stones

go with prover that says in a fight play from your weaker stones -- 

now you are pushing black to attack your center group];B[he]
C[Sumiyaka:  I was happy to have this move, I felt I had one group safe and one group in dangernow, and white had two in danger.


CC yes black is doing well now];W[jd];B[id];W[lc];B[je];W[kf]
;B[kd]C[Sumiyak: Probably slow on black's part.


CC  no its good ... nice and solid... perfect for when you are winning]
;W[ld]LB[ne:A][og:B][mh:C]C[Felisratus: B must just extend solidly to p13 (or even just play bamboo-joing at n12), and it'll be very unlikely, that W will manage to live there :( So looks like  I missed something in this fight.

Sumiyaka: I agree now.  :)

CC youare right -- i would like to see black play C -- white is still in a whole lot of trouble and black gets to watch him squirm...]

;W[ii]C[Sumiyaka:  The moved I missed in my reading.  This is the game winner IMHO.


CC dont see the problem... why not just connect? see var]
(;B[hi]C[CC this is bad -- see the variation... you have to keep connection to center stones ..]
;W[lg]
(;B[ij]C[Sumiyaka:  I didn't see a way to win the ko.

;W[jg]
(;B[lp]C[Sumiyaka:  I still had a chance at the game, but I wasn't sure where to play.  My goal was to reduce white on the bottom, and carve out some space in the center.  It didn't work that way.

End of Sumiyaka's comments.


CC this seems like an unpredictable route to take -- you are not actually behind... nice points on the left and 3 corners... no need for desperate measures]
