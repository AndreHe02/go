C[J: My name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments will begin with "J:".]
;B[pd]C[Hi,



So I'm learning to play less on teritory and more on influence.

I start valueing strong shapes and tickness above anything mostly.



I try my oponent to get at least one weak group on the board which is big enough so it cannot be sacrificed.



I made a very stupid reading mistake in the end which made me resign.

I read a ko threat wrong.



I went over the game with my oponent but I feel I need more opinions from stronger players about this game.



I'm very intrested in:



- Direction

- Midgame

- Connection moves & problems.



Although if I did any big mistakes in fuseki or joseki i'm also very intrested to hear.



Thank you for doing this review,

Roel];W[dd];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq];W[qj];B[fc]TR[qg][qh][ql]C[J: Black normally forces white to settle small first.]
;W[jd];B[qh];W[qm]
(;B[ld]TR[df][cc][cf]C[J: M16 is the wrong direction, since R17 is still invadable M16 becomes small.  Consider double approaching with C/D14 or dive into the corner with C17.  See variations.]
;W[hc]
(;B[fe]C[J: since H17 stone has somewhat of a base, diving into the corner is still possible.  See variation.]
;W[df];B[db]C[J: The D18 slide is helping white hold the corner.  If omitted, black has the option to take C17 himself later.]
;W[cc];B[kf];W[he];B[gd]C[J: F13 is a must.];W[hg];B[fg];W[dh]
;B[hd];W[ie];B[id]TR[ic]C[J: simply playing at J17 to eat H17 is better.]
;W[ke];B[le];W[jc];B[ic];W[jf];B[kg];W[qc]C[J: R17 demonstrates to the inefficiency of M16.]
;B[ig]SQ[ih][dj]TR[fi]C[J: Touching the stones you're attack is not advised: "touching a stone makes it stronger".  It would be better to attack from a distance at F11.  This will make sealing white at J12 and reducing white's left at D10 miai.]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[jh]TR[ih][jg][kg]C[J: This exchang is painful for black.  The highlighted stones are a "cut knight's move".  Whenever you see this, black most likely has already made a mistake.]
;B[hh]C[J: Stop touching stones.  J12 should be left for aji later.]
;W[gg];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[rd];B[re]
(;W[rc]TR[qe]C[J: White can play R15 instead to connect to R10.  See Variation.]
;B[od];W[pa];B[sd];W[ra];B[sb]C[J: T18 is waste of ko threats, and loss of points.]
;W[sc];B[qb];W[rb];B[kc]C[J: M16 is strong, white can't make eyes at the bottom.  So L17 is only hurting J17.]
;W[jb];B[kd];W[je];B[ib];W[kb]TR[kh]C[J: white's turn is small here. Making influence and strengthening up at L12 is more important.]
;B[mb]TR[lb][cn]C[J: M18 works.  Since black can't attackwhite any further, disrupt the left side at C6.]
;W[kh];B[mg];W[cb]
(;B[dc]C[J: E18 is correct response here.  Black also has the option of playing F12 to escape.  See Variation.]
;W[da]C[Should I have responded ?

J: should have never happened if black E18 instead of D17.]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pm];W[pl];B[ol];W[ql]
(;B[fq]TR[pn]C[J: black can play Q6, to build more influence.  See Variation.]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[pn];B[pj];W[om]TR[jj][gh][ol][pk]C[Is this a fair result ?

I wanted to keep center group weak; this gives me some kind of thickness towards the center group.



white gets ponuki though. Should have played different ?

J: This is better for white.  See my previous comment.  L12 actually isn't in that much danger, because he has two ways to run. remember: "ponnuki is worth 30 points", and both P8 and Q9 are weak.]
;B[gh];W[fh]TR[jk][kk]C[J: white can just jump away. Hard for black to catch.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[eh];W[fi];B[eg];W[hj];B[dg];W[cg];B[cf];W[ce]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf];B[di]C[J: turned out really good for black.]
;W[cn]TR[ii]C[J: white should play J11 to make sure black's four stones is completely dead.  See variation.]
(;B[cq]C[Wrong direction ? Making teritory on the middle bottom enough ?



My idea here was to make stones weak on top so I could get teritory in sente later. But white foiled that plan as you see later. Is the idea wrong or the execution wrong ?

J: C3 is a territory move.


J: corner is large, pulling out the J12 cutting stones is possible.  K4 is also very large.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[fn]C[J: F6 is inconsistent with C3.  if black C3, black should follow up with B2.  As it stands, white has profitted in the corner.  Black could have played C6 without C3.]

;W[hm];B[in];W[jm];B[im];W[mk]TR[jp]C[Now it feels that my stones are useless.

Not sure what I did wrong.

J: I'd actually consider that a good result for black.  Black can now reduce left's white side to nothing, because black saved his cutting stones. See variation.

J: The K4 stone can also be attacked. See Variation.]
(;B[ml];W[jl];B[jn];W[lm];B[lk];W[ll];B[oj];W[lo];B[ln]C[J: splitting the two stones like this is rarely good.  Seems like black has already lost his chance to attack white.]
;W[kn];B[mn];W[ko];B[lj];W[mo]TR[mm]C[J: white can simply eat N6 with N7.]
;B[mm];W[ho];B[hn];W[hq];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dn]TR[er]C[J: white can ignore C7 and play E2.]
;B[bq]C[J: B2 is correct shape for black to keep the corner and stay connected to B2.]
;W[er];B[cs];W[eq];B[fr];W[fp]
(;B[gp]C[J: E2 is enough. See variation.];W[fs]C[I'm not sure if i could connect, don't think so.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[fo];W[ep];B[iq];W[ip]C[J: this is too much territory for white.]

;W[or];B[pr];W[ns];B[op];W[sn];B[ro];W[ea]TR[ps]C[J: white now has Q1.]
;B[so];W[ps];B[sm];W[sl];B[gr];W[hr];B[es];W[gs];B[qr];W[ds]
;B[ki]C[J: not a ko threat. Black should just respond at C2.]
;W[cr];B[ji];W[kj];B[mj];W[ii]C[I read ko threat wrong here.

In general I should not have played ko with my corner anyway i guess.



But I felt I probably did not have enough points.


J: I think the big take-aways from this game is to mind the direction of your opening and attacks.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
