;B[pc];W[pq];B[dd];W[cp]C[This is good.  Both players have played a move into each of the four corners first.]
;B[qe]LB[pq:A]C[I think this is the biggest point on the board, because it makes a shimari, and it plays into the widest side - the right is 13, the bottom is 12, the left is 11 and the top is 11.

Also, this move is low, so it balances well with the high stone at A (Q3).]
;W[jc]LB[ep:A][eq:B][qo:C][po:D]C[I'm pretty sure my teacher would disagree with this move.

Although playing a move in front of a shimari like this is big, making a shimari at A (E4), B (E3), C (R5) or D (Q5) is even bigger.  In this case, A and B should be bigger than C or D, because the bottom is still 12 wide, while the right is now only 11.]
;B[jq]LB[eq:A][ep:B]C[Much the same comment here as for move 6 - a kakari at A (E3) or B (E4) would probably be the biggest.]
;W[eq]LB[fq:A][jq:B][mq:C]C[A big move, but perhaps A (F3) is better, because it is dual purpose: it strengthens white's corner with a kind of loose shimari, but at the same time puts pressure on B (K3), almost demanding a black move at C (N3).]
;B[kd]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[I think A (Q5) or B (R5) is the biggest here.]
;W[cj]LB[qo:A][po:B]C[This is big - a large extension in front of a shimari, but A (R5) or B (Q5) look bigger.]
;B[ql]LB[po:A][qo:B][qe:C][qk:D]C[This is big, a large extension on the less-advantageous side of the simari, but not as big as A (Q5) or B (R5).

Actually, as large extensions go, perhaps D (R9) is a little better - a 5 space extension is particularly advantageous in many situations, usually preferred over a 6 space.

A is probably better than B, because A is high, which balances well with the low stone at C (R15).]
;W[cf];B[ce]LB[cf:A][df:B][cj:C][ci:D]C[This does take a firmer grip on the corner.

However, there are two negatives to it.

One is, it attaches to a weak stone.  Attaching to a strong stone is often a very good move, but attaching a weak stone is a "thank you move"; it asks your opponent to strengthen their position.

Two, once A (C14) is strengthened with a white move at B (D14), C (C10) is suddenly an ideal extension away from the A-B wall.  If C were at D (C11), this would be a good move, as it would make White overconcentrated (too many stones played given the amount of territory grabbed).]
;W[df];B[ee]LB[fc:A][fd:B][gc:C][jc:D]TR[cf][df]C[This might be good if you wanted to attack the triangled white stones (C14 group), but they are strong.

I like A (F17) or B (F16) or perhaps C (G17).

C is interesting because although it doesn't strengthen the corner as much, it has the secondary purpose of attacking D (K17).]
;W[qo]C[The last really big point.  This probably should have come sooner.]
;B[gq]LB[gq:A][mq:B][pj:C][ol:D]C[This isn't really a bad move, but it is not urgent, as A (G3) and B (N3) are miai (if white plays A, you can play B to keep a base, and vice-versa).

I kind of like C (Q10) in this position, as it threatens to take a really large corner.  Or perhaps even D (P8).]
;W[eo]C[White's LL corner is getting both big and solid.  I think Black needs to invade the LL right away, or stake out an even bigger territory somewhere else (like the UR).]
;B[go]C[This isn't bad.  I like this.  It doesn't develop the G3 base that much, but prevents White from developing the LL even further.]
;W[dl]LB[bp:A]C[Must invade or make a counter-moyo right away!

To invade, I would probably start at A (B4), then try to live in the corner or on the side, depending on how White responds.]
;B[mq]LB[hc:A][ol:B]C[This is not small, but not as big as a move at A (H17) or B (P8) I think.]
;W[gc]C[Opportunity lost; white has a base on the top now, so it will be much harder to attack there.]
;B[ge];W[fr];B[oo]LB[ol:A][kc:B]C[I prefer A P8) or B (L17) here.  B is an ok attachment I think, because White's group on the top is already fairly strong, and I think Black gets more out of the deal.]
;W[pp];B[po];W[gr]LB[qn:A]C[I prefer White A (R6).];B[id]LB[jd:A]
[id:B]C[If you wish to enclose White's group, I think it is better to play A (K16). B (J16) invites a White push at A, creating cutting points in Black's position that could later be used to break out of enclosure.]
;W[jd];B[je]LB[ie:A][ke:B]C[Now Black has cutting points at A (J15) and B (L15) - disadvantageous.]
;W[qn];B[pm]C[This is good; you're keeping White shut in.];W[pn]
;B[on];W[rm];B[fi];W[dh];B[fe]LB[gl:A][lj:B]C[I do not think this is a necessary move.

This has become very much a moyo game.  I think you should play something like A (G8) or B (M10) here - A to stake out an enormous moyo, and B to divide the moyo into two more manageable halves, both of which are quite large.

I haven't counted, but I suspect either of these halves would be enough to offset White's large lower left (LL).]
;W[be];B[di]LB[ci:A]C[I don't like this move.  It essentially asks White to strengthen their position with A (C11).  In exchange, it doesn't give you an appreciably stronger grip on the center, and it leaves you with a weak stone that could be captured in the endgame.]
;W[ci];B[qh]LB[gl:A][lj:B]C[This is a sudden switch to territoriality. I think it is better to stay with your influence strategy with A (G8) or B (M10).  Flexibility can be important, but so can consistency of strategy.]
;W[bd]LB[ce:A][dd:B]C[Black's corner is gone, and A (C15) and B (D16) are no longer useful.  However, that corner is much smaller than the center if you can actually hold onto it.

I would be remiss if I did not point out that it is much easier to hold onto a corner or side, than the center.

Some people say the corners are gold, the sides are silver, and the center is straw.

Then again, I've been known to take all four corners and then lose the game to a large center because I gave up so much influence to get those corners.]
;B[cc]C[I do not think this is consistent with your apparent strategy of taking the center.  The corner is already mostly gone; it is probably time to just relinquish it altogether in order to take something bigger - the center.

You have SOOO much influence here, and white has so much territory, I think you must take the center, or at least a very large UR corner, to win.]
;W[bc];B[bb]LB[bc:A][gc:B]C[This is a small move, an endgame move. Much better to go after the center.

If your goal was to keep A (B17) and B (G17) separated, there is plenty of time for that later.]
;W[rl]LB[qk:A][rk:B]C[Excellent - White is crawling on the second line.   This too is an endgame move, not something to play this early in the game.  If white wants to take a miniscule amount of territory on the edge, I believe you should give it to them, taking significant influence in exchange with A (R9) - hoping White will continue with B (S9).]
;B[en]LB[gl:A]C[I really like A (G8) better if you want to take the whole ball of wax.]
;W[cn];B[rj]LB[rk:A][fl:B][qk:C]C[This is endgame.  Better to take B or C.

Visualize the difference between White A, or White B before this move. White B is much bigger if you're going after the center.

Actually, even after this move, White C breaks a little way into Black's moyo now.]
;W[hr]LB[hq:A][ip:B]C[Great - more crawling on the second line!

I believe I would play A (H3) or even B (J4).];B[ir]C[This side is small compared to that gigantic center...  This kind of asks White to run into your center a ways.]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[eb];B[fc]LB[gl:A]C[This strengthens White, and isn't as big as A (G8) I think.]
;W[fb];B[hb]C[I think killing these stones isn't as big as grabbing the center.  I'm not sure the attack works either.]
;W[ec];B[fd]C[This is not an important stone to save.];W[ip]
;B[ko]LB[in:A]C[I prefer A (J6).];W[db];B[cb]C[Good defense, to keep White separated.]
;W[ca]C[This is a mistake];B[ba]LB[in:B][hc:A]C[This is not necessary - if you don't play this, White remains separated.

A (H17) is a good way to kill.];W[kc]TR[jd][jc][kc]SQ[fb][eb]
[ec][db][ca][gc]C[Now it will be hard to kill the triangled stones (K17 group), but the square stones (E18 group) are still killable.]
;B[da]LB[hc:A]C[This is a very small capture - one point, maybe two.  It is an endgame move.

It would be much bigger to go after the center, or persue your kill on the top with A (H17).]
;W[ea]LB[hc:A]C[This is not a good move.  It too is an endgame move.  It should be saved for the endgame.

It will not help white make two eyes, so it is irrelevant to the life and death of the group.

A (H17) still kills a sizeable white group.];B[ca]LB[hc:A]C[It is best not to defend this.  If White wants that single stone, they should be gleefully given it, while you take something else far larger elsewhere on the board.

You can still kill with A (H17).];W[ke]C[Now white starts to exploit the previously-mentioned cutting points.]
;B[ld];W[ie];B[jf];W[hd];B[ic];W[ib]C[As you appear to have realized, White is alive now.]
;B[he];W[hc];B[if]C[Great move -keep White shut out of that mamoth center.]
;W[lc];B[lf]LB[lc:A][le:B][md:C]C[The geta doesn't work with A (M17) there - White can run away with B (M15) (although if White does run that out, they'll have a difficult fight ahead with all those black stones nearby).

I prefer a Black move at C (N16) to keep White low and take still more influence that could be used for a gigundous center or at mimimum a quite large UR.

If White wants to crawl on the third line, that is slightly advantageous for Black.  If White crawls on the fourth line, that is bad for Black.  If White crawls on the second line, that is wonderful for Black.]
;W[nc];B[mc]LB[md:A]C[This leaves a useful double atari for White at A (N16).]
;W[mb];B[md];W[ob];B[od]C[Good.  Let White hop into the corner - the point of this game is the center.]
;W[pb];B[qb]LB[qc:A]C[This almost works, but not quite.  It is better to play A here.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[me];B[le];W[id]C[This is a truly bizarre move.   It rescues an unimportant stone.

Saving one stone can be big if it makes the difference between connection and being cut off (for a weak group), but if it's just one stone that has no effect on the rest of the game, like here, then it is a poor move (until the endgame).]
;B[kf]LB[kg:A][jh:B]C[This is a small stone - leave it for the end game, or even leave it "dead as it stands" for scoring.

If you are worried white would peep at A (L13), you could at least play A yourself (a little faster), or perhaps B (K12) (to make a severe attack on the three white stones after White connects)]
;W[ei];B[ej]LB[fh:A][fj:B]C[I prefer A (F12) or B (F10).];W[dj]
;B[ek];W[oe];B[mf];W[pd];B[pf]LB[of:A]C[I prefer A (P14) here]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[oc];B[of]C[Ok, White's shut in again.  Good.]
;W[rc];B[od]LB[in:A]C[This is an endgame move.  Best left for much later in the game.

A (J6) is big now.];W[rb]C[This is a strange move.  Unnecessary I think.]
;B[oe]C[This is so small - it's only worth 0.5 points. There are much, much bigger points on the board.

Much of go is timing.  Many moves are good, but a good move played at the wrong time is a much less good move.]
;W[re];B[rf];W[dm];B[em];W[el];B[fl];W[fn];B[fm];W[dk];B[fo]
;W[ep];B[gn];W[fj];B[fk];W[gj];B[se]LB[gi:A][fh:B][hk:C]C[This is small, an endgame move.  I think you should attack the triangled stones with A (G11) or B (F12).  Perhaps C (H9).]
;W[gm]LB[in:A]C[This is just strange.

I would respond with A (J6).];B[rd]LB[in:A]C[This is forcing, but not as big as taking a more solid grip on the center with A (J6).]
;W[qc];B[ik];W[fh];B[ih]LB[fi:A][gi:B]C[Oh, must save the cutting stone at A (F11) with B (G11).  This is very big.]
;W[gi];B[hk];W[ab];B[hf]C[Good move.];W[jp];B[op]LB[kp:A][jq:B]
[ir:C]C[I prefer A (L4).

It probably saves B (K3) and C (J2), and strengthens your grip on the center.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[oq];B[np];W[kq];B[hp]TR[gp][gq][hp][go][gn][fo]
[en][em][fm][fl][fk][ek][ej]LB[in:A]C[This is not useful.

I like A (J6) here to help the triangled stones (G3 group) (in reality, they are in very little danger), and strengthen your grip on the center.]
;W[nr];B[mr]LB[in:A]C[I think A (J6) is much bigger.];W[kr]
;B[gk];W[jo];B[jn];W[lo];B[ln]LB[kn:A]C[I prefer A (L6).];W[kn]
;B[km];W[ko];B[mo]LB[in:A][mn:B]C[This is very thin.

I think A (J6) or B (N6) is better.];W[jm];B[in];W[lm];B[kl]
;W[om];B[ml]LB[mn:A][lm:B][om:C]TR[mo][np][op][oo][po][lp][mq]
[mr]C[I prefer A (N6).

If White tries to cut off the triangled stones, black can still atari through to connect in the center.

B (M7) and C (P7) are very weak, there are so many black stones nearby they will have nowhere to run to.]
;W[lq]LB[lp:A][nq:B]C[This is not a good move.  If White captures A (M4), Black can simply connect at B (O3).]
;B[mp];W[ll];B[lk]LB[mn:A]C[Better to play A (N6) I think.]
;W[mn];B[nm];W[jl];B[kk];W[ol];B[oj]LB[nn:A]C[I think A (O6) is better.]

;W[rk];B[sj]LB[sn:A]C[Not necessary - locally it is better to play A.]
;W[hm]C[This is certain death for the just-played stone.];B[im]
LB[sn:A]C[No need to respond to this.  Better to take a bigger point somewhere else, like A (T6).]
;W[dn]LB[sn:A]C[this is much smaller than A (T6).];B[hn]LB[sn:A]
C[This is not necessary.  You are already connected.

A (T6) is still big.];W[nq]C[Not necessary];B[il]C[This too is not necessary.  You are safe there.]
;W[ms]C[Not necessary];B[sn]LB[so:A]C[:)  Good.

I think A (T5) would be even better];W[ro];B[so];W[fp]LB[rq:A]
C[This is a bizarre move.  No point.

White should instead play A.];B[sc]LB[sp:A][sq:B][rp:C][rr:D]
C[I think this is smaller than playing in the lower right.

Black has some options here.

A (T4) is simple, and damages significantly.

B (T3) is a little bigger, and still quite safe.  So is C (S4).

Black might even be able to play D (S2) here, significantly damaging White's corner.]
;W[sb];B[sd];W[rn]LB[rq:A]C[This is a poor move.

A is better (S3).];B[sp];W[rp];B[sq];W[rq];B[rr];W[qr];B[sr]
