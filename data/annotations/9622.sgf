C[Hi there.

My name is Michael.  I'm a 4kyu player.  This is mostly going to be a midgame and endgame review.  Your fuseki seems good for your level and I won't be able to give you much in the way of advice without getting too bogged down in details.

Major turning points of this game are move 60, move 75, move 80, move 125 and move 194 of course.]

[cd]C[This situation is called the Kobayashi Opening.  You're probably already aware of this, if you're playing it.  Here's some homework on this fuseki.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeWNVuzebU

The main takeaway is that your opening is slightly weird because of your marked stone.  It should be at C16 instead.

Later on white can play at A or B and make something in this area easily.

I can't say that it's *bad* it's certainly playable.  It's just a little strange to my eye.]

Black: 89 territories + 2*3 dead stones(W) + 3 prisoners = 98
Result: W+9

This game was an unfortunate result.  You were ahead for most of the game.  You outplayed your opponent in the fuseki, during midgame you had a few major blunders but so did your opponent and the result was still good for you, but during endgame your opponent slowly ground away your lead.

I suggest practicing your fighting and your reading.  Try doing life and death problems.  They should help you with your shape and reading.  I also suggest working on your endgame.  Learning about how to estimate how much an exchange is, and when to tenuki.  What's really sente and what only looks like sente.

The elementary go series has a book on Life and Death, Attack and Defense and Endgame.  I suggest reading them if you can grab a copy, digital or otherwise.

If you have any questions or concerns about this review, please let me know.  And if you want to hit me up for a teaching game, I play on Dragon Go under the same username as my e-mail address.
