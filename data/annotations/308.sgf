(;W[pg]C[Q13  should have been K17, a two purpose move :
a pincer against O17 and a continuation of the joseki when Black plays tenuki  in upper left corner]
;B[id]
(;W[oq]C[White should have played in B and if  Black plays tsuke, play the avalanche joseki (see variation B)]

(;B[pm]C[I  think a pincer move around B would have been better
Black can't expect good continuation on the right side
Instead, playing in B would make D4 work perfectly]
(;W[qk]C[I think B would  be better because Black in B would
be a too good continuation];B[qr]C[R2 is very bad, it makes P3 a kikashi  (think reverse,
if White had just played P3, would you answer this move with R2 ? of course  not, this would be too
submisive)
M3 only]
(;W[lq]C[I think B is better because P3 became a kikashi stone
after R2, so no use to defend it, it has done its job];B[dj]C[D10 is a very  good move]

(;B[dm]C[D7 should have been in B, too many  weakness with A,
White can easily invade with C6 and C3]
(;W[db]C[Your comment "Maybe better to  expand lower
side & protect against keshi, e.g. P5 now."

My comment "the direction is good, but you should
have played at E17, making Black overconcentrated,
see variation B"];B[jp]
(;W[oo]C[Your variation "A or B"

My opinion "there is no good answer to Black K4, B would make it kikashi, A  is not really bad, but you should play C before A to prevent connection  underneath. C is sente, C3 being the key point.
Anyway, the best move would have been imho D : you have to be consistent with  your move in D18 which attacks E16 stone"]

(;B[gq]C[K4 is a kikashi move, no  use to defend K4 stone,
