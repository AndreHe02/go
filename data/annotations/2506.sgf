(;B[qp]C[I think that this move is a little odd..you have a 3-4 point, but open on the side your opponent's stone is on. [see variation\]]
;W[cd]
(;B[cj]C[I think that this move is a little odd here. It is invading white, but I think that it's a better idea to approach the corners first sometimes. [see variation\]]
;W[cm];B[ec]C[This is a good move, just one move too late [like making this move instead of c10\].]
;W[cg];B[ej];W[ic]C[In turn, by having to protect c10, you thus make e17 weak, and form two weak groups. Generally when youdo this around the same area, one will die. This is why it's important to think out your move, how your opponent might answer, and your next few moves or so. Try not to have two weak groups because while you are strengthening one you are probably weakening your other group.]
;B[cc];W[bd]
(;B[gb]C[This is an okay move, you could also try d16 [see variation\].]
;W[lc]
(;B[nc]C[I think that this move is small. With every move you make, take a look at the whole board situation. Always take a little time to consider if there is a bigger move to play [which is the case here\] or what vital points you can play at [such as weaknesses in your opponent's shape\]. [see variation\]]
;W[hb]C[I wouldn't ignore white's play here, since white could do some damage later. Also, it's hard for your group to run out to safety in this situation, so I think it's better to protect the life of your group. [see variation\]]

(;B[ld]C[This move leaves you open and really doesn't help your position/shape too much. There are still large moves on the bottom side of the board. [see variation\]]

(;B[oq]C[[see variation\]];W[mq];B[fq];W[dq]

(;W[am];B[ap];W[bn]
(;B[ak];W[ao]C[This group is alive here [the white one\] so I think it's time to move on to bigger moves, such as on the right side. This has potential to be huge for you. [see variation\]]
