;W[dp]TR[kc][kd]SQ[cn][po]C[(Triangles) These are generally played as black in the opening, since it also helps the top left corner.

;W[rd];B[re];W[ob];B[nb];W[ra]C[This file shows that you each had 10 minutes without extra byo-yomi, was this the case?

If it was, then q18 was fine, but if you had more time (10 minutes plus 20 second byo yomi), then you should take the time to read.

You have two choices, and s17 is a better capture than q18, since it completely kills the white stones.]

;W[fe];B[he];W[db];B[cc];W[gd];B[hd];W[dc]TR[ed]SQ[cb]C[This can be better countered by attacking his eye shape (triangle), or taking points in the corner (square), otherwise you don't make as many points as you could.]
(;B[cd];W[cb]TR[ml][cn][dp][dq][dr]C[The bottom left is "facing" towards the right, not the top.  Play a probe (a move to force your opponent to commit to a plan) and try to do something on the bottom.  I have given some examples.

You can also ignore all this and play the huge attacking move at n8.]
(;B[cl]TR[ci][jp]C[This leaves a weakness at c11, and lets white secure the bottom.]
;W[cq]TR[eq][dr]C[He should probably play this at least at D2, if not at E3.]
;B[em];W[di]TR[eh][fh]C[The triangles would be a better way to attack this stone.  You should not touch what you are trying to attack.]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[dj]C[Dangerous crosscut, this gives him the ability to create a stronger group for himself.]

;W[ek];B[el];W[gg]TR[iq]C[I would play at J3, to stay away from his strong left corner, and use his n3 stone to get stronger (see variations).]
(;B[hq];W[fq]C[He should approach with K3, and push you into his strong corner.]
;B[kq];W[lj]TR[jj][ll]C[Take this opportunity to threaten his stones, since he has shown he wants to save them.]
(;B[ig];W[kg];B[kf]C[Don't touch this stone...You don't have that much territory to defend over there.  Playing something like L12 could capture it, and keep his o10 group weak.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[jg];B[jf];W[ih];B[hh];W[hg];B[if];W[ii]C[His once weak group is now comfortably alive, and he has captured a good 10 points while reducing your top area.]
;B[mg]C[The rest is mostly endgame, and I think black has a good 15 point lead right now (thanks to the kill on the top right).  I would work on not trying to just defend your territory (like the l14 move, or the c11 move), and attack stones when they don't have good eyeshape and your opponent is trying to save them.  Also, try to see what shapes are strong, and which are weak, so you can learn to feel the areas you should play near (Play near weak areas, not strong, so you support your weak stones, and attack your enemy's.  Playing near your strong area will make you overconcentrated, and playing near your opponent's strong areas will not make many points, and life will be difficult).

If you have any questions, feel free to message me on KGS (account names: sevrusblck, hollumber) or email me (hollumberjac@yahoo.com) and type "GTL Review" in the subject line.

I hope you enjoyed, and wish you all the best on your journey :)]
