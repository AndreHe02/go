C[Vacuity [2k?\]: hi have fun
Bubarik [1k\]: good luck

R:
The game can be summarized like this:
You make one mistake in the first joseki, which gives white a large portion of the side, while you gain a wall with some defects. You should focus on utilizing your influence to gain points, you shift your attention away from this at some crutial moments in the game, which causes you to not have enough points to keep up.]

TR[dj]C[R:
This is the standard move, you get serious shape problems when you pull back]
(;B[dl];W[dj]C[R:
ouch];B[ej];W[di];B[hq]C[i guess this was to aggressive? :)

R:
I guess this is logical, but you have serious shape problems because white played the hane]

Too far away, i would play the high approach, because of its focus on the outside]
;W[pn];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[eg]C[R:
I Think it is a better idea for you to try to get as much as possible in the centre and force white to make an invasion then fight]

;W[no];B[np];W[op]C[i thought i can live with this result... ponnuki always nice, but ...
R:
This is a disaster, white lives in your senter, and he has taken very very many points in the corner, the ponnuki is nice, but its hard to make a large amout of points, which you really need now that white has taken one very large side an a huge corner]

It think this move is more solid]))
(;B[qk])
(;B[ql]C[here? i think i have better chances ...
R:

I dont think you should play this, you force white into where you wish to make points, anyway white as enough room to not worry about life, snice you played n4 which gives him quite alot of room]

R:
In a way, if white playes the same way the result is better.
But if you wish to fight i think playing the keima is a ok approach]
