AB[pd][dp]C[Eloriot: I feel like I got myself in a bad position in the opening, so it would be nice if you could comment on that. The endgame was a little bit rushed on both sides due to the time limits used in the game.

** Hi, I am Emerus, KGS 1dan. I will be reviewing this 2H game for Eloriot. My comments will be marked with a double asterisk (**). Please note that I cannot claim 100% accuracy on my variations so please bear with me.]

(;W[kd]C[** A bad shape --

Eloriot: With the white stone on L16, is an invasion on the top side still realistic? I felt like I could hardly place a stone in beetween D16 and L16 destroy whites territory at the top at this point or any point later in the game.]
(;B[pj]C[** Play on the widest side instead.];W[jq]

(;B[cd]C[** Too soon.];W[cc];B[bd];W[de]C[Eloriot: The development of the upper left corner seemed quite bad for black, or is that just me? An alternate approach would be wonderful :). Maybe even starting with B16.

;W[cq]C[** A mistake.];B[cp];W[dq]
(;B[bn]C[Eloriot: I also thought about E4 or F4 to escape or at least to destroy whites potential in the middle whilst sacrificing my two stones.

(;W[or]
(;B[pn]C[Eloriot: Is this move to small to be played at this stage of the game?

** It is too slow. Because you are strong in the area, this stone would only be a burden for white to rescue. See variation.]
;W[lk]C[Eloriot: This move did seem rather pointless to me, so I decided to decrease the potential territory white could build up in the center.

** White is trying to reduce your potential in the center. Black should be in an attacking spirit.]
(;B[ne]C[** Yet another slow move.];W[mg];B[bc]C[Eloriot: To use my C-G14 stones to reduce the white center I wanted to make shure the black group was actually alive.

;B[jo];W[hm];B[hl];W[io];B[kp];W[lp];B[kq]C[Eloriot: Black escapes.

Overall, black lacked aggression. Espcially when receiving handicap stones, it is important to make life hard for white. Adopt a more aggressive mindset and play near the weak groups and open areas. Thanks for allowing me to review, I hope you enjoy.]
