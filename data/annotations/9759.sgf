RE[W+34.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[B: Hi, I'm bart, I'll try to review your game (for the black side).]
;B[pd];W[tt];B[dp];W[pq];B[ee]C[B: this is a move you play if you go for influence. The other 2 moves are on the 4-4 points, so also for influence. So you can expect to get territory mostly on the side and in the center, depending on what white does.]
;W[dd]
(;B[np]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[B: 2 interesting things here: 
1. you ignore the first move by white. Now it looks like white played on the 4-4 stone and you played the 5-5, which is a strange way to approach.
2. your move at O4 is from the wrong direction, I think. See variation.]
;W[po]C[B: this can be expected from white.];B[op]LB[kp:A]C[B: not good. You know white will respond, which makes him stronger. Better play around A to make a base on that side.]
;W[pp];B[fd]C[B: good. E16 is also possible.];W[ce];B[dn]C[B: ok.]
;W[qf];B[of]TR[gc][oc]C[B: idea is good. But the space between the marks is quite big, so white will invade there.]
;W[rd];B[pf]LB[qc:A]C[B: better to play at A and keep white out of the corner.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]LB[pc:A]C[B: with your previous move, you told white to take the corner. Better to stick to that and defend the side at A.]
;W[qe]
(;B[pe]LB[pc:A]C[B: you can still play A.];W[pc];B[fq]LB[pe:1]
C[B: not playing at A gives white the opportunity to take the top side. You defend some of your lower left corner, but all the stones you played in group 1 are mostly useless, which is a shame. See possible continuation.]

(;W[ch];B[eg]LB[ec:B][oc:A][qg:C][ck:E][qm:D]C[B: I'd prefer to play one the labeled moves. I think there is a lot more to gain at the sides than in the center, whcih you are protecting with your move.]
;W[hc]
(;B[pj]C[B: dangerous. White can connect from the left corner to that stone. Better keep him separated.]
;W[qh];B[ph];W[pg];B[og];W[qg];B[pi];W[kc]CR[gd][hd][id][jd]
[kd][ld][md][nd][od][gj][hj][ij][jj][kj][lj][mj][nj][oj]C[B: you have a wall facing to the left. Below it (at the top) are 2 white stones with a base. They will live there and negate all your points.]
;B[oc];W[pb];B[de];W[dc];B[cf];W[be];B[cg];W[bh];B[dh];W[cj]
;B[dj];W[di]
(;B[dk]C[B: don't ignore D11. Better keep your stones connected.]
;W[ei];B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[bl]
(;B[eh]LB[bm:A]C[B: what is more urgent? Keeping white out of your territory, or strengthening a weak group? In this case I think your group is not so weak. It already had 1 eye, and it can also run towards the big wall on the right.
Keeping your territory is more important now.];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn]
;B[fi]LB[bo:A]C[B: see previous comment.];W[bo];B[ej];W[ci]
;B[bg];W[ah];B[ag]C[B: it's good to see if you can keep white groups separated. But you do this so you can attack the groups. But both white groups are strong and alive, so better use your moves on big points.]
;W[qm];B[ec];W[ed];B[fc];W[db];B[eb]C[B: you cannot make territory at the top side anymore, so no need to protect there. Better see if you can play a big point, or attack those white stones from the top.
See variation.];W[gb]

C[B: see variation.];W[hd];B[cp];W[jq];B[lp]C[B: better attack the white stone and play low (M3).]
;W[hp];B[jp];W[ip]
(;B[kp]C[B: better one lower at L3];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr]
;W[ir];B[gq];W[hq];B[io];W[ho];B[hn];W[gn]C[doin99: knight fork

B: I don't know that term.];B[in];W[fo];B[fp];W[en]
(;B[dm]SQ[cl][dl][cn][dn]C[B: no need to play here. White can never get through. The marked stone form what they call a bamboo. See variation.]
;W[em];B[do]C[B: see previous comment.];W[hm];B[im];W[hl];B[fj]
LB[eg:A][dp:B]C[B: white cannot do anything there. But even if he does, is that bad? Group A and B are both strong and alive.]
;W[gk];B[jk]LB[bc:B][or:A]TR[mb][kc][hd]SQ[qm][po]C[B: what is the purpose of this move? The white group is alive and cannot be attacked. Top side is still open (white stones there (triangles)) and the right side as well (white stones there (squares)).
Better play A for territory or B to see if you can get white in trouble there.]
;W[fl];B[gj];W[hj]
(;B[ik];W[hk];B[hi]C[B: better play here immediately instead of the J9 move.]
;W[ml]C[B: I think that's an overplay by white.]
(;B[ij]C[B: see variation.];W[lm];B[jo]C[B: don't be afraid, attack white! See variation.]

C[B: this part is already strong after the earlier moves. Better close part of the center, or B17.]
;W[no];B[mj];W[rl];B[rk];W[kl];B[jm]C[B: ah, so you know the bamboo.]
;W[km];B[kk];W[lk];B[lj];W[je];B[jg]C[B: good.];W[hf]
(;B[kh]LB[lf:A]C[B: not so good. Better at A.];W[lf]C[B: which is where white plays now.]
;B[ih]SQ[hh][jh][lh][ii][ji][ki]C[B: your last 3 moves made around 6 points (marked). See variation for a different outcome.]
;W[ge];B[fe];W[ff];B[fh]C[B: good!];W[gg];B[hg]LB[mg:A]C[B: small. A is bigger.]
;W[if];B[jf]C[B: try not to bump into the white stones, unless you want to cut.]
;W[kf];B[ef]LB[fh:A]C[B: you already protected with A, so no need to play here now.]
;W[kg];B[ig];W[nd];B[od];W[nc];B[ne];W[me]
(;B[nf]LB[mg:A]C[B: better at A.];W[lh];B[ji];W[li]
(;B[nj]LB[nh:B][ni:A]C[B: better at A or B.];W[mh];B[mi];W[nh]
;B[oh];W[ni]LB[oj:1]C[B: 1 point. See earlier variation.];B[ng]

(;B[jh]C[B: it's only 1 stone.];W[qi]
(;B[kj]C[B: better R10.];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[rj];W[ae];B[oj]
C[B: no need for that. Better T13 to get some points back.]
;W[ri];B[gi]SQ[fh][fi][hi][pi][gj][nj][pj][ok]C[B: again, no need to. When you have the shape I marked, the cutting point is protected.]
;W[da];B[ea];W[ga];B[sk];W[sl];B[hh]SQ[hg][ih][gi][hi]C[B: same.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[ao];B[ap];W[gr];B[fr];W[gs];B[fs];W[ls];B[os]
C[B: ouch. Better keep white out on the left.];W[ms];B[gp];W[go]
;B[ii]C[B: unless you count by the chinese rules, I think you're filling your own territory here.]
;W[ps];B[na];W[ma];B[fg];W[gf];B[gd];W[ie];B[mr];W[ln];B[ns]
;W[ks];B[sj];W[si];B[tt];W[tt]C[Blootooth: i felt like i was reacting too much

B: yes, and at times where it was wise to react, you play somewhere else. Try to see what the white move aims at. Is it to attack your group? Or cut your stones? Or to get into a big part of your territory? Then react! If it only captures 1 stone, or reduces a few points of territory, see if you can find anything bigger.
I hope you my comments help you a bit. Have a lot of good games!]
