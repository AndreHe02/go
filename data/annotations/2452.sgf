C[This is a game I played today on IGS. I was black and I won by 0.5. There was no komi so this could be considered a lost game. I'd apreciate your comments.

vlkplk: i think that you did pretty well, so this was surely a won game for you. even komi counts...]

;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[om];W[jd]C[vlkplk: Maybe little more press on white lower right group would be good. It cost nothing!]

(;B[ch]C[vlkplk: I would prefer to attack that corner more directly. This move allowed white nice closing of both corners.]
;W[cf];B[ck];W[dr]C[vlkplk: Now white has (almost) three corners safe and what will be the use of black's strong wall in lower rig
ht part?]
(;B[mc]C[vlkplk: I have some feeling like to place this move one line left and down, at M16. There is some territorial framework, which black wants to build.]
;W[gd]
(;B[kb];W[jb]
(;B[qh]C[I'm always in doubt during the opening. I don't know how I should play. If you
have any sugestions go ahead.

vlkplk: This is problem now. You are trying to make territory here, but:

1.corner is still open for invasion, as happened in game and
2.white is peeping into black's area with stones at R6,S6.]
;W[qd]
(;B[pc]C[vlkplk: This is rather complicated situation. I recommend you to look at some book, such as '38 basic josekis'. But finaly, it went good for black anyway...]
;W[qc];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[rf];W[qf];B[pe]
(;W[rd]C[vlkplk: I have slight feeling, that there is something wrong with this white response. But I remember only standard moves in this situation.]

(;B[pf]C[vlkplk: White stone at R14 is captured, but white can use it for good efect as a threat and make some move somwhere as a ladder breaker.]

(;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[pa];W[rb]
(;B[le]C[vlkplk: Seems the best black could do. I din't find even a ko in the upper right.]
;W[pr]C[vlkplk: This was a key point for both sides. There is standard technique, which makes about a same result, but gives black sente, see var.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[qo];W[ro];B[fg]C[vlkplk: Ok, black took sente anyway, but the
 weakness at P3 or O2 is dangerous.]
(;W[dh]
(;B[di]C[vlkplk: Why not to push against white territory. I think, you can't think of invasion inside there anymore...]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[cg];W[df];B[dg];W[eg];B[fi]C[vlkplk: Pushing like this you help white build more territory. It's ok, but you must think, what you get for exchange.]
;W[gh];B[bm];W[bn];B[gi];W[hh]
(;B[jf]C[vlkplk: I think now the very key point is J10. It aims at building territory either on upper right or middle/center.]
;W[hi];B[gl];W[hq]C[I wanted to defend there next, but white was first.

vlkplk: In lower/left part, this is hard pattern. I don't know well, how to 'defend' it,
 so usualy, in my games I leave it open and see what happens later. As you did...]

;B[co];W[bq];B[em];W[cm];B[bo]C[I guess this is pretty good. I think that white C7 was a mistake.

vlkplk: somehow, yes. but white's intention was to counter black potentiality of making
large area in lower and middle part of board.];W[fm];B[el];W[en]

C[Again my next move would be here. Or should i play here before N9?

vlkplk: N9 was ok. sometimes, there is no choice and to make a move which is good for shape is a must. next-how about var.?]
