AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[CS: This game confuses me, because it feels to me that White is losing the entire game, but only loses by 1.5 points in the end.  I was White, and I still can't figure out where my territory came from.

T: I marked strong positions with squares, weak spots with triangles. You'll find a summary at the end of the game.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fp];B[dn];W[jo]LB[jd:A][cj:B]C[AN: This sets up a fairly shaky group. I could probably invade but have no idea how or whether I should.

T: you don't need to invade unless you're behind on territory. Would you invade now if White had played K4 ?]

(;W[cq]C[CS: This invasion didn't work out so well. White C11 would have followed the principle of "get strong, then invade", but it seems slow for a handicap game.  Maybe C16 to make the pincer at move 22 less attractive before invading?

T: C5 may be played as a probe. Because of the weakness there, C1 is not necessary: it is a slow move.]

[fn]C[CS: White is not happy here (should he be?).  The three stones are no big deal, but Black seems thick.

T: The local fight comes to a conclusion. Good time to estimate the situation:

Territory balance:

R3 open corner = 5
C17 open corner = 5
D4 = 12
Black = 22

C3 = 6
D14 = 4
White = 10

Power and moyo balance:
+Black is thick around F6.
-White is thin around M4, and has an open skirt at H2.
+ Black can grow a moyo around Q16.

Black is ahead on territory, power, and moyo potential.
This shows C3 was bad timing. Now what should White's strategy be ?]
;W[pg]LB[qi:A][pj:B]C[White is behind on territory, and has some central influence already. Erasing the moyo from the open side is ok, but i'd consider going for cash with R14.]

(;B[ng]TR[cd][hd]SQ[ei]C[AN: Trying to use the wall.
CS: This feels like the wrong direction to me.  Black wants to prepare for an attack on the lower side, yes?

T: Wrong direction indeed. Black is not that big at top. Attacking is a better way to control the game here.]

[hd:B][ge:C]TR[ei][ni]C[AN: Wasn't sure how to respond to this.
CS: Not sure where I would move as black... A doesn't really defend the corner, so seems a half-measure.   B lets white live with profit, and the thickness seems to be canceled by the triangled stones.  Maybe C?

This looks too deep. White's left group is not strong enough.]

(;B[do];W[bd];B[hr]C[AN: Not much of a ko threat; the idea was to remove any hope the H4 group had of making a base.

;W[kg]LB[kh:A][lp:B]C[CS: Maybe this is bad. But it does eventually let White connect.  And a simple connection with F12 gives Black sente against the lower group.  Does this mean that the original upper side invasion was a mistake with the bottom so weak?

Summary:

Black: you came out ahead from the first fight, but then played a number of vague or slow moves that didn't build or threaten much in any direction.

Try to give your moves at least one clear purpose, and make stones work together. When you have thickness, don't hesitate to take sente and attack weak groups in a fruitful direction.

White: you invaded too soon, tended to give much thickness, and as a result got a difficult game.

You should try practicing tighter extensions (3 or 4 spaces), waiting for chances to gain and take sente through attack. Look for severe invasions that split the enemy. If it's just about points, you should consider waiting.]
