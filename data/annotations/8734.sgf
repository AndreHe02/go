C[zi99s060jp [3k\]: hi];B[pd]C[Hello. I'm black. Thanks to review this game.]
;W[dd]C[jusi [4k\]: hello gg];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc]LB[fq:A]C[I often play the chinese opening (r9), but this time I try another opening. Please could you tell me if the following fuseki is ok? I think so, but I'm not so sure.

H: It's too early to say that it's bad at this point.  As black, I prefer to play at A in such a shape.]
;W[cf];B[jd];W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[no];B[mp];W[rq]C[I find this move a little strange. I'm waiting for a move around q10. What is the best white move here?]
;B[qj]C[i decide to take the right side: nice combination with q16-k16. If white k3 then black r2 and  there are two running groups. If white takes the corner then I could expand to the bottom.

H: This was white's mistake.  Black takes the lead.];W[pr]
(;B[or];W[qr];B[iq]C[One of the think I planned. Ok my black group is not fully safe but it is enough yet.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf];W[pb];B[mc]C[In this position, I fill that this joseki may be good for black...]
(;W[md];B[lc]C[But actually I don't remember the joseki :(. Maybe m16? But I prefer to play safe with m17 in order to be sure to not overplay.]
;W[nd];B[qc]C[I'm really happy: my upper group is stronger, I take the corner and the white group has no eye :). Probably white miss something here (o16 should be in r17?).

H: White made a mistake and is floating now];W[ld];B[kc];W[qb]
;B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[mg];B[fq]C[I hesitate between q12, f15 and f3. I choose the latest since the two other moves are gote and this one also strengthens my bottom group.]
;W[dn];B[ck]C[I don't want to let white take all the left side. I think it is the right position since c12 and b6 are miai whatever white does.]
;W[ci];B[bn];W[bp]C[I find this move a little bit strange.]
;B[cq]C[I decide to attack strongly. Maybe overplay?]
(;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cp];W[bm]C[That is a good move actually...]
;B[cn];W[cm];B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[em]C[Even if the stone at b4 is annoying, I seems to be alive... So I live in sente but white seems to be quite strong now...]
;B[fp]C[I play my sente moves...];W[ep];B[dl];W[dm];B[fn]C[maybe this one is not sente actually...]
;W[en]C[Even if white gently connects...];B[fk]LB[bk:A]C[Now white does not looks so strong, but heavy. My initial attack at c3 looks to be quite a success.

H: White isn't so weak.  For example, he can play at A and cause some problems.]
;W[fo];B[hp]C[H: This is an important point in the game.  Black must avoid believing that he is entitled to attack white.  Continuing an attack could cause black to ruin aji or to create an overdrawn shape.]
;W[ho];B[gm]C[Probably this move is wrong. I should not defend the kikashi stone at f6 but play somethink like j5 inducing a white move around g8, then a black move around e11.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[hm];B[gk];W[kp]C[Good white move...];B[kq];W[lq]
;B[lp];W[jq];B[kr];W[jp];B[jr];W[hr];B[gr]C[I read several (all?) sequences and white h2 looks overplay...]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[fr];B[gp];W[io];B[hs];W[go];B[ir]C[The bottom group is ok even if white can still reduce it from o2. The white group is stronger now but still not connected but the black f9 group is weak...

H: The white group is almost alive.  Black should not be worrying about attacking it.]
;W[dj];B[el];W[kn];B[ln]C[Maybe strengthten the black group is safer but I do not want to let white connects.]
;W[nr];B[oq];W[hl];B[hk]C[I love this move. Maybe h8 was not good and somethink like m7 would be better.]
;W[km];B[lm]C[Still don't let white connect.];W[ds]C[I will see if my previous reading was good...]
;B[ar];W[an];B[ao];W[am];B[bo];W[bs];B[cs]C[Safe :).];W[ph]
C[Yeah, white good move.]
(;B[qh]C[I hesitate to cut this stone and the n13 stone but I prefer to play safe here: If I split the white stones, my r16 group and my r10 group will also be splitten :(. And I already have a weak group at f9.

H: I prefer to defend by attacking.  q12 does not make you unsafe.]
;W[hd]C[Good move too. Very annoying especially because my f9 group is still weak.]
;B[fe]C[So I jump in order to attack the white stone and to begin to rescue my f9 group.

H: Nice.];W[je]
(;B[ic]C[Trying to save this group but maybe h17 would be better?]
;W[hc];B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[ec];B[fb]C[It is more agressive than f16 but maybe it is overplay here...

H: This feels dangerous.];W[hb]C[... because now the l17 group is weak.

H: Yes.];B[cc];W[eb];B[ed]C[Maybe this move is not good: I could leave in the corner, then connect the l17 group with the f9 even if I loss the f17 stones...]
;W[dc];B[fg]C[I should play d15 in sente first...];W[hg];B[de]
C[But white did not see it :).];W[cd];B[ih];W[hh];B[fi]C[Ok, two of my three weak groups are connected :).]
;W[ii];B[hi]C[Actually the cut is overplayed. I did a mistake while reading since I thought I can catch the k15 or the j11 stone :(.]
;W[id];B[ke];W[jf];B[kg];W[kd];B[jc];W[kf];B[lf];W[le];B[jg]
;W[ke];B[ib];W[mb];B[lb];W[nb];B[ji]C[ok I lost this fight and my upper group and there is still a weak black group at j15 while the f18 group is even not fully alive... The game looks very very hard for me right now.]
;W[ij];B[gh]C[Trying to live...];W[jj];B[ki];W[ka]C[I guess this move is not required: this group is already dead...

H: Yes.];B[ce];W[be];B[bd]C[Overplay ! Didn't see that d14 was sente :(]
;W[df];B[ee];W[bc];B[bf];W[ad];B[bg]C[... and didn't see that this move does not work :-(.]
;W[ch];B[kj];W[jl];B[lg]C[Trying to build points in the center. I know that it is hard but it looks like my only chance.]
;W[ll]C[Good move... destroying most of the center.];B[kk];W[kl]
;B[hj];W[il]C[Then I saw that the j8 white group has not two eyes and is still not connected. I thought that my last chance is to kill it or to at least to take points by attacking it very strongly.]
;B[bj]C[Separate the j8 white group from the left side  in sente...]
;W[bi];B[in]C[Remove the second eyes (in gote).];W[ko];B[jn]
;W[ml]C[Actually I don't thought I can succeed right now...]
;B[mn]C[The only move?];W[nf]C[look not very good... Somethink like n11 or o7 looks better.]
;B[mj]C[Now white is really separated...];W[qg]
(;B[pg];W[qi];B[rh];W[pi];B[ri];W[pj];B[pk]C[Usually I play r9 in such a case but I don't want to let white connects even if I have to lost points.

H: Too easy for W still.];W[ok];B[pl]C[Now no cut at the right side seems to work and the white group is still separated. But my l13 group is very weak too :-(((.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[oh];B[nk];W[oj];B[mk];W[nl];B[ol]C[Look very hard for black since I have not enough liberties...]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[nh]C[Actually it is required...];B[lh]C[... But I'm alive! :))]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[ej]C[White tries to kill me...];B[eh]C[I love this sente move :).]

(;W[ei]C[Actually this move is not the best one (see variation).]
