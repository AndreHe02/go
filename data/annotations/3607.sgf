C[Black: Esef / around 15k DGS rating

White:HugoDePayens / around 15 k DGS rating

Played on DGS June 2004

zs: Hi, I'm ziggystar. 15k IGS/7k KGS
I'll try my best at reviewing this game for both black and white. As always, my comments are probably totally wrong. :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]LB[pq:A]C[zs: I think usually Q3. White will have a nice approach later in this corner.]
;W[cd]LB[dc:A]C[zs: Same problem.];B[qj]LB[oq:A]C[zs: I would have played P3 to fix the possible white approach in this corner which would be too good for white.]
;W[dj];B[fq]LB[ed:A]C[zs: Better approach at top corner (A). Letting white pincer this stone isn't good.]
;W[hq]C[zs: Good.];B[fo];W[op]C[HDP:Should be at P3, I guess.

zs: I think P4 is ok. Probably better than P3.];B[mq];W[em]
LB[lp:A]C[zs: This stone should be somewhere near A to help the two white stones here. This seems urgent.]
;B[en]LB[hq:A][op:B]C[zs: Black should attack the two white stones A,B.]
;W[dn];B[dq];W[kq]LB[lp:A]C[zs: The last exchange made black stronger. So White's stones are getting weak. I would probably play higher near A.]
;B[np];W[on]C[HDP: Better at P3 to have the possibility to take a piece of the corner with R3 afterwards? Obviously I was afraid to loose infuence at the right side.

zs: Yes, P3 seems better here, because it prevents black from connecting.]
;B[oq];W[pp];B[pq]C[zs: Now Black has a nice position in the corner.]
;W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[so]LB[fm:B][jd:A]C[zs: This is a yose move. Play bigger points. Maybe A or B. White should ignore this move.]
;W[sn];B[sp];W[rn];B[jc]C[zs: Good.];W[nd]SQ[qj]MA[on][op][pp]
[qo][rn][ro][sn]LB[qf:A]C[zs: This move better at A. Maybe White can use it's wall at R5.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[md];W[ne];B[lc];W[mb];B[nb];W[pf]C[zs: Letting Black capture with M18 isn't good.]
;B[lb]C[esef: M18 an overplay?

zs: This isn't overplay. overplay is when you play in a territory where the enemy has too much influence. Black just captures.]
;W[me];B[ld];W[rf]LB[qj:A]C[zs: Ok. Now Black has to run his stone at A.]
;B[qe];W[qf]C[HDP: At this stage I was quite happy with my performance on the right side.

zs: Yes, but the black stone can still escape.];B[re];W[od]
C[HDP: Seems a big fault to me now. Gained nothing with it.

zs: At least it's sente, threatening to take the corner. But it's not gaining anything.]
;B[oc];W[ec]LB[qj:A]C[zs: Now, Black really has to care about A.]
;B[og]C[HDP: This move confused me as my answer to it will show.]
;W[pe];B[qc];W[qh]LB[mg:A]C[HDP: I didn't know how to answer to Blacks invasion. Now I think M15 or O13 might have solved it better.

esef: I estimated that white would move to o13 for influence

zs: R12 is a bit defensive. White should have played somewhere around A.]
;B[oi]
(;W[ql];B[of];W[oe];B[mg];W[rj]LB[lf:A]C[esef: Isn't  S10 very small? More perspective on H17 or D14?

zs: White's group at Q14 needs help. Either escape with A (Also attacking Black) or connect as happened in game. I would have prefered to escape and attack.]
;B[le];W[qi]MA[rg][rh][ri][rk][rl][rm][sg][sh][si][sj][sk][sl]
[sm]LB[lf:A]C[zs: Now Black is out. White didn't gain much with his two walls at the left.]
;B[pj]
(;W[qk]C[HDP: Why, oh why? I desperately tried to keep the whole thing connected on the left. But as R14 seems much alive, probably something like Q8 or P8 would have be a better move.]
;B[gc]LB[dg:A]C[esef: that or... I was not brave enough for the aggresive mode on C13

zs: C13 looks a bit like overplay. But I think D13 is a possible reduction.]
;W[cg];B[fe];W[fn];B[gn]C[esef: c4 that would be the big move!!

zs: I would have played E5, but this corner looks complicated. Hard to say what will happen.]
;W[fm];B[cp]C[esef: ah yes, white on c3 ?!?!

zs: bC4 at C3 looks like better shape.];W[do]C[HDP: Ehhrr, maybe C5 instead?]
;B[co];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[eq];W[ho];B[gq];W[hp];B[go]C[zs: This looks ok for black. White has to save H5 now.]
;W[hm]LB[ko:A]C[zs: Better L5.

zs: Now follow some nice reductions by black.];B[bm];W[cn];B[bn]

;W[eh];B[fh];W[fg];B[gg];W[df];B[ef];W[cf];B[ff];W[fd];B[gd]
;W[ee]LB[hn:A]C[HDP: Too bad I got lost in such small fights instead of trying to increase influence at the middle.


esef: Yes I agee better O9 or something like that.

zs: Cutting or connecting at A looks big.];B[fj]C[HDP:...which fact Black abused shameless.]
;W[hk];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi];W[ii];B[ih];W[jh]C[HDP: Aiming to cut the N13 group apart.

zs: Good idea.];B[ig];W[jg];B[ki];W[ji];B[jf]
(;W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[ke];W[kg];B[mf];W[mi]MA[mq][np][oi][pj]
C[HDP: Again, trying to gain little instead of building up my own mojo (maybe at the lower middle). Stupid me.

zs: I can't see a moyo. The marked black stones will reduce White's territory at the bottom.]

zs: White should have fixed his weakness at L6 instead of M4.]

C[zs: Nothing to fear.]
