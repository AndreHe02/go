C[Notes for the reviewer :

I have lost this game, by nearly 30 points,
which seems quite a big difference
considering :

- one kyu difference betwen players

- I did not make a big blunder where I lost a
big group.

Obvioulsy, I missed important development
points, but I don't understand where

As obvioulsy, I leave weaknesses in my
groups, but I am unable to correctly spot
them.

Basically, I would like to understand where I
missed important Go rules and behaviour.

Thanks in advance

(jcs) Caveat: I have been asked to comment on DRS' comments.
Since only a high ranking pro knows the truth about go, I just
may have a better random opinion.];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[oq]
C[DRS: My teacher says this and C15 are biggest on move 5.

(jcs) ( Apparently your teacher is Mr. Yang 7p. )];W[qj]TR[oq]
[pd]C[DRS: So I believe that according to him, missing C15 is a lost
opportunity.

(jcs) At this point, w6 is doable. Because, on the right, it's
11 lines between a 4th line and a 5th line stone.];B[qg]C[DRS: This too:  C15 is still begging to be played.

(jcs) Sorry, but urgent plays take precedence over big plays.
Black's R7 is sente against White's R10. White must extend to
R7 to make a base.];W[qm];B[de]TR[dp]C[DRS: There you go; C15 is better for making life.   If you feel
this is shaping up into a moyo game, then D15 is best.  This
doesn't look moyoish to me tho, so C15 might be preferable.

(jcs) That is Mr. Yang's theory, I agree. Nevertheless, D15 is
doable for balance.];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[ef];B[df]C[I followed quite stubornly the Joseki.
Problem is : I don't know the correct
development after this.

DRS: Joseki, according to Kogo's.];W[nc]C[DRS: According to Kogo's, White E16 would have been joseki, followed
by B C9.

(jcs) Correct, that is a joseki. Since White did not follow it,
black must see if he can punish White right away. Here, E17 next
for Black would do it.];B[jc]C[I wanted to pincer, and help D14. Any
comments ?

DRS: I think the pincer kind of begs W to invade at R17, which
isn't entirely unattractive given the distance of R13 from Q16.
So perhaps this asks W to do a good thing for W.

(jcs) rather than K17, black could Q17 hoping White will L17,
then play E17; however, E17 for Black right away seems best to
me. Press  White low and make the black stones around D14 into a comfortable
position. White E14 loses all meaning then.];W[hc];B[nd]C[Idea was to let corner go, but get wall
toward center

DRS: Maybe this does have a reasonable chance to give you your
wall, but it also attaches to a weak stone.  It more or less
asks White to strengthen O17.

(jcs) The normal way is corner, side, center. Also, if nothing
special is going on, take the cash. O16 seems to me a direction
mistake in this case. (Black should Q17.)];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[qf]C[DRS: I think maybe this is slow.  F3 or C9 or C6 or J3 would
be bigger.  I consider C9 fairly urgent];W[rg]C[Up to there, I am happy with upper right
development.

(jcs) Black can continue to press White down in sente.];B[cm]
C[I still prefer C9 or C6.  But perhaps that's because I haven't
studied C7 much.

(jcs) C9 is proper to make a base.];W[ck]C[(jcs) D11 is a better attack against the upper Black stones.]
;B[em];W[ek]C[Now the C14 group is in some pain.  You can extend to C11 and
make a base of sorts, but it feels overconcentrated.  C11 does
have the advantage of threatening to link to C7.];B[gq]C[DRS: IMO, this begs White to jump out to F5 or so, which hurts
E7.  I think I'd rather jump out with G9 here.

(jcs) When white did E9 (aimed at weakening the black upper left),
white also broke the guideline "move the inside stone out" in
the lower left corner. Black must punish this right away. F4
instead of G3 puts more pressure and works better with Black's
C7 and E7 stones.];W[dn];B[dm];W[er];B[eo];W[di]C[DRS: C14 is really hurting now.  It has bad shape and no base.

(jcs) Black needs to come out with b.]
(;B[bh]C[DRS: I don't think you're going to get two eyes locally if White
decides to harrie this group.  It's probably best to run.

(jcs) yes];W[iq];B[kq]C[(jcs) first H3? then White J4 is heavy when Black follows with
M3. The game may get complicated.];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ip];W[fq]
;B[do]TR[dn]C[I was not satisfied with the overall shape in
lower left, and decided to secure it,
possibly letting W exploit H4 weakness

DRS: I agree, C7 needs to get settled.

(jcs) D5 catches an unimportant small stone. Black can just play
K4. It's urgent.];W[jp];B[io]C[DRS: How about K3 first?];W[jq]
;B[kr];W[cp];B[co];W[fp];B[hp]C[DRS: How important is it to rescue these stones?  They are only
two, and they don't separate a weak group from safety - so they
are probably small until the endgame.  I think it is bigger to
help C14.

(jcs) H4 is so ugly and painful that anything is better. Black
cannot win if making a move like this.];W[jo];B[jn];W[in];B[hn]
;W[im];B[gm]C[K6 was intended for securing H4 group

DRS: I think it helps a little.

(jcs) K6 was an overplay because of Black's awful shape.];W[fo]
;B[fn];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[gj]C[DRS: W helps E9 and weakens C14 further.  And H4...]
;B[jm]C[I started to fear W right development

DRS: If you are concerned about W's right getting big, how about
Q6 or O10?  K7 doesn't feel important to me, and predictably,
W's J7 group was strengthened.

(jcs) Black must somehow settle his group on the top left.]
;W[il];B[ln];W[lo];B[mo];W[lp];B[mr];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[ll]
;W[oi];B[no]C[DRS: Why?  Is N5 an important stone?  Is O6 going to be damaged?
I think N5 was unimportant, and O6 can run to R7 even more easily
after this move.  B's increase in territoruy in the LR seems
slight.

(jcs) It's too early to pull out N5 since Black created a weak
group around L7 that needs help. Also, O12 is urgent for Black's
upper shape.];W[on];B[jg]C[I imagined this as helping both K7 and D14 groups

DRS: Agreed.  I like this.  It develops too.

(jcs) allowing White to play O12 is unthinkable. Urgent points
before big points. After White's hane, K13 is no longer effective.]

(;B[kh]C[I think I was wrong here. L10 might have been
much better . I did not see W surround M8

DRS: I'm not wild about L10 in my first impression, but...]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[nl];B[nm];W[mk]C[DRS: Wow, overplay.];B[nk]C[DRS: This connects, but does it give the group as a whole life?]
;W[ol];B[om]C[(jcs) If White does Q6 can the black group survive? I cannot
see it.]

;W[ec];B[eh];W[qd];B[oe]C[DRS: This feels slow.  If W cuts at Q15, I think W will have
a hard fight to save the cutting stones.

(jcs) P14 is the vital point locally.];W[og];B[pg]TR[nk][mj]
[nj][ni]C[DRS: These two are cutting stones, separating O12 from P11.  However, if you think that O12 is safe connected to G10, this
might be small.  If you feel you could attack G10, this is big.

(jcs) cutting stones? I don't understand your comment.];W[of]

(jcs) No, Black lost earlier.];W[kb];B[ma];W[jb];B[ff];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[mf];B[lg];W[lf]C[DRS: Perhaps the two aren't that important.  They are not cutting
stones.  This might be best left for the endgame.

taking sente) is good thinking for improving your go game.]
