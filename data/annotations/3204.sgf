C[Hi, this is your reviewer Chun-Kit (4k IGS, 2k DE).
I have added some notes especially in the first moves (review for white)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[fq]
(;W[nq]C[rika:
after only 5 stones it's already important to destroy black's shimari formation by occuping its follow-up move. 
wD10 is better.
If you want to approach a star-point-stone, I recommend bR6 just because you have a stone at wQ16]
;B[lq]
(;W[pq]C[rika:
this is not joseki. The only answer is wR3 (see var)];B[qq]

(;W[pr]C[rika:
normal is wR2 (see var)];B[qr];W[op];B[po]C[i need to know what went wrong in this, or if the other guy was just playing really poorly.  i just dont know how i could have handled this better.

rika:
this is really a poor result for white. black can be happy to (1) secure some corner territory, (2) keep white heavy with at most one eye]
;W[jq];B[lo];W[nn];B[oo]C[rika:
not recommended];W[no];B[on]C[rika:
this one, too];W[lm]C[rika:
dangerous jump]

(;W[or];B[ps];W[ls];B[os];W[mr];B[oq]
(;W[qf]C[rika:
looks small to me... black has a bigger influence from the lower left, so destroy something there seems to be bigger to my eye]
;B[hp];W[dj]C[rika:
well timed. black has to capture the wJ4 stone];B[io]
(;W[cg]C[rika:
I don't like that. Go for bigger one (yon-sen-rei-formation with wK16, see var)]
;B[fc]
(;W[fd]C[rika:
don't let black have a easy group by playing a attachment-joseki (see better var)
another option is simply wD17 with wC13 already in position]

(;B[hc]C[rika:
somewhat strange. usually bG16];W[ec];B[fb]
(;W[eb];B[gd];W[fe];B[ge];W[mc];B[kc]
(;W[qi]C[rika:
it's better to limit black's escaping route by playing wN15...]
;B[qk]C[rika:
but black answer all your approaches (which is - of course - bad since black lower right is already safe]
;W[qc];B[cl]
(;W[dn]C[this was kind of a move to try to get in to that whole corner, but it really helps me out in the later part of the game.  it would have been dead but my opp. made a mistake.

rika:
yea.. it's very deep in black's territory so it's not a surprise that you had problems with it.]
;B[el];W[ck]C[rika:
why contact play? black will build a border, so the white lone stone has to fight on its own]

(;B[dk];W[ek];B[dl]
(;W[bk];B[bl]
(;W[fk];B[ej]
(;W[kd]C[rika:
urg... don't use ladder breaker.
you will have to sacrifice wB9/10 stones in exchange for 'ponnuki' by capturing bE10]

that was your ladder breaker, now black can destroy some territory crawling the second line]

rika:
if capturing the 2 stones is important for you there were a better play]

(;W[mg];B[hh]C[rika:
now white helped black to be back in the game];W[oj];B[ok];W[mj]

(;B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[ll]C[rika:
protect cutting points is more usual (wM10)];B[hl];W[jd];B[jc]
;W[id];B[ic];W[he]C[rika:
there is no cut because wG14-group is already in atari];B[ke]
;W[le]
(;B[hd]C[i was a little confused by this move. i couldnt figure out why he did that]

(;W[lf];B[kh];W[lh];B[ii]C[rika:
strange, there is no territory in the center];W[ij];B[ik];W[jj]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[jm];W[jl];B[il];W[pk];B[pl];W[nk]C[rika:
not good. black captures with bQ10 and you must block him (or at least 15 pts are gone)]

(;B[ol];W[nl];B[pj];W[pi];B[qj]C[rika:
well, you got the most of it (usually black tenuki, i.e. playing somewhere else)]
;W[rj]C[rika:
gote,
wF19 is sente end play];B[rk];W[ri];B[li]C[this one next set of moves was really weird too]

thanks for taking you time reviewing this game.

rika:
you're welcome... 
summary:
(a) in the beginning you missed some important points (big moves, urgent moves)
(b) in the ending stages take your time (just find out if there are any defects in opponent's structure)

after looking at your game two or three times there were some highs (capturing the lower group) and lows (heavy play in the lower right before capturing, ladder breaker, the cut at H15, invasion in the lower left). But this is normal in your level.
