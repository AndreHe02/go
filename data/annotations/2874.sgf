So this would be an excellent move a bit later on in the game. However, for now, the four corners have been claimed but three sides are still open. You should first claim them before you try to squeeze your opponent. (I would prefer any one of the marked moves.)]

;B[jk];W[ki];B[lj];W[li];B[jf]SQ[ki][li][ij][jj]C[PNH: This is very good for black. It reduces greatly the value of your wall. This is why claiming the sides was more important at this stage in the opening.]
;W[ke]TR[gc][cg][ch]C[is it wrong to approach this sitation like this? is there a more profitable way?

PNH: Any of the marked points seem better. However, there is now the threat of a cut at k5 which is a weakness in your position.]

[ig]C[PNH: This is not so urgent. Black threatens to make some very big profit with it's upper right wall. Playing at g11(or maybe f11) would rob him of much potential territory.]

;B[fc];W[ec];B[gd];W[fd];B[gc]TR[cg][ch]C[can i do anything for the area black started to sorround? or did i lose there already?

PNH: Think about securing or laying claim on what is open before you try to reduce or invade. (Unless you can do both at the same time : reducing your opponent and securing territory for yourself)

;W[di]TR[ch][ck]SQ[eb][ec][dd][fd][fe]C[PNH: C3 seems better. C6 might be even better since it works with the upper left corner. Your move lets black crawl under your position.]

thank you for your comments...

PNH: This was a nice game to review. You played pretty well overall. Remember that the sides are the most important thing to secure after the corners, especially the positions facing  walls or corner enclosures (either your own or your opponent's). And don't let your opponent slip uner your position too easily.

You will make progress very fast at this stage. Especially if you read books. Continue enjoying the game.
