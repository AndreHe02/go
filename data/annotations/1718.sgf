C[I (lieten) played white here, and since I am a bit inexperienced at moyo-building games, I didn't know for sure where to play. At times, I couldn't even tell who was ahead.

I am not sure how I ended up being behind in territory, but when I realized it, there didn't seem to be any way to fight back. The capturing race in the corner just brought to an end a game that had already been won for black.]
;B[pp]C[Non-standard, but oh well.

 :-)];W[pd];B[dd];W[do];B[dq];W[fp]C[I like this joseki, especially in the basic form. I was thinking of balancing the power of the fourth-line black stones.]

(;B[cp]C[I am not sure, but I thought that this move was not joseki.

I agree.];W[co];B[fr];W[bp]LB[cj:A]C[I wasn't sure if I should play this move instead of playing tenuki.

Just at A might be possible.];B[bq]
(;W[dp]C[This is not so good. Only at B5 is the normal move. (See variation.)]
;B[cq];W[dj];B[jq];W[qj];B[nc];W[pf];B[pb];W[qc];B[kc]C[After this, I wasn't sure whether I should turn to the black lower right corner or to move against the black stone on the upper right.

I'm also not shure. :-)];W[df];B[fd];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce]
(;B[dc]C[D17 is bad. It should be at B17.]
(;W[qn]C[Should I have simply invaded on the other side instead of approaching?

I guess this is kind of a matter of taste. But if you have a look at the board,  like this both players have two sides but black has more corner territory.
It becomes difficult for white to go ahead. Especially because there are no
weak black stones to harras.];B[np]C[This helps the overextension F2 K3.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[on];B[lp]C[Again, I was stumped as to find a move. I reasoned that expanding my moyo on the right would be good.

I think this is a correct estimate. One migth consider an invasion arround H17 or J17.
But this would give black a target.

Black M4 ist overconcentrated.];W[ld];B[lc];W[nd];B[mc]C[Instead of N17 P17 is correct.]
;W[md]C[Should I have played a one-point jump on the right? Or was connecting proper?

It's ok.];B[pi];W[pj]C[I wasn't sure whether to push up or sideways.

I would push up too.];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[rh];B[nj];W[ic]C[Since Black had a nice wall on the right from the shoulder hit, I wasn't sure about invading here, but I couldn't see any other way of catching up in territory.]
;B[jd]C[Bad shape. L16 is better.];W[he];B[hd];W[id];B[ie];W[gd]
;B[hc];W[gc];B[hb];W[fe];B[gb];W[fc];B[fb];W[ed];B[hf]C[White missed an atari at J14. For instance before F15.]
;W[ge];B[if];W[hq]C[I guess this was a bad move...

G3 or G2 looks better. White suffers now from the D4 C3 exchange. Since black has the option of capturing B4 white can not push him hard.]
;B[cl];W[cj];B[el];W[gm];B[fk]
(;W[fi]C[F10 is better shape.];B[hk];W[im];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi]
;W[jp];B[kq];W[hh]C[Should I have played on the lower side? Maybe at J3?

It seems white has no time for a reinforcement on the lower side.  The only hope might be an attack on black.]

C[I was aiming at the cut at E9.];B[bk];W[ek];B[fl];W[dl];B[dm]
;W[dk];B[fn]
(;W[cm]C[I thought that by connecting, I would lose much more.

This was the sequence I imagined would happen if I connected: WG6, BC7, WE7, BF7, WE6, BE5, WD6, BE4 and my group in the center would be in trouble.]
;B[gn]
(;W[em]C[I guess this was a horribly bad move, since it allowed black to play F7.

Yes, D7 is not interesting and the exchange hurts G7.];B[fm]
;W[en]C[I guess I should have ignored it and played something like M7.]
;B[mm]C[I wasn't sure what to do here, since it seemed like I was behind in territory. Was I?

Black is about 20 Points ahead on the board.];W[mn]C[I decided that the best I could do was reduce from the sides.]
;B[ln];W[lm]C[I don't know what I was thinking here.];B[ml]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[mo];B[ko];W[mp];B[mq];W[rq]C[Well, didn't that throw a whole bunch of stones away? I guess I was hallucinating or something.]

;B[pq];W[ir];B[qm]C[I didn't think this cut would work. Apparently, I was wrong.]

(;W[rm]C[Maybe I should have played at S6.];B[qo];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[so];B[ql];W[pl];B[rl];W[sn];B[sp]C[I guess the problem with your play is the proper handling of influence.
You should seek for weak positions of your opponent and try to attack.
Your moves in the later fuseki lack a little meaning as they have no impact  on your opponents stones. R10 comes to mind. You should seek for an  opportunity to use a weakness like F2 K3.

Not easy to pin down the reason. Maybe its a lack in local technique.
If you like, you could try to look at some professional games. Then you might
get a feeling for moves like B5 instead of D4.])
