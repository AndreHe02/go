AB[gc][cg]C[My strength is 4 Kyu.  Igowin is playing at level 2.   (As Igowin calculates such things)


I went through the file to preanalyze it, but I couldn't find anything I thought I would have been better doing.  I have never played at 4k before, and I don't know how soon the game was lost.

xxc : hi, i'll do the review
before anything, 9x9 is in my opinion the most difficult size board to play go, space is really small, each move must have maximum effect and a little blunder becomes very big]
;W[gg]C[xxc : perhaps this is already too small
but it is safe and may find life];B[cd]TR[cc][ec][fc][dd]C[xxc : g3 is strong and safe
white can afford starting a new group and the only area is top left side and corner

but it is difficult to say where is the best];W[ee]C[xxc : this offer black e3]
;B[ec]C[xxc : now, really difficult

black nearly had top and left side + corner and may extend at righ or bottom]
;W[ce]C[xxc : seems the last area to attack];B[be]TR[dd][dg]
C[xxc : too many difficult way to fight here];W[ge]C[xxc : white had not time for this move, he may go on with the fight at left side]
;B[de];W[df];B[cf];W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[eh]TR[cc][bd]C[xxc : white can us the ko, but it seems difficult for him to win this ko]
;W[dh]C[xxc : white can't play here]
(;B[de];W[dg]TR[hc][hd]C[Maybe my move was to passive?  But I don't know where better to have gone.

xxc : the only other move is a big threat, and bigest is see is top right]
;B[fe];W[ce];B[fd];W[ff];B[bc];W[de]TR[hd][bh]C[xxc : too early to connect]
;B[af]C[xxc : this is small a chance :)];W[ch]TR[hd]C[xxc : other corner seems bigger]

(;W[ed];B[fc];W[bg];B[bf];W[bh];B[ih];W[hg];B[hi];W[hh]TR[fh]
C[xxc : i do not think a move is needed

but for safety, i will play something stronger];B[gi];W[fh]
;B[eg];W[ef];B[ei];W[fi]C[Wasted move?  I think the game was lost by this time anyway.]
;B[ag];W[ah];B[tt];W[tt]C[xxc : 9x9 is a fighting life and death all game long, lose a group and it's game over

i think that the white loss is from the first 2 moves
these moves are too safe and do not put enough presure on black

i hope this will help

thank u])
