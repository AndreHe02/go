orthrus [4k\]: thx

kh: Hi, after looking at the game, I can see some points which you were overly aggressive, such as L3 hane and O2 trying to kill before surrounding. Also dragging the k16 stone with n16 to try to save the whole group was heavy. Sometime just surround your opponent and attack from a distance, he will need to spend moves living while you can get territory. Especially as white, you can be comfortable with just taking territory while opponent is running out. If you have any queries or any other games, feel free to contact me. Have a nice day :)]

(;W[nl]C[kh: black is unlikely to attempt to break out so he may just live]
;B[nr];W[fp];B[go];W[gm]C[kh: now you can commit to attacking the left group, which is weaker
and also if you fail to kill it you will still get territory in the corner]

(;B[cn]C[kh: better to play nearer to corner]))
(;W[nn]C[kh: connection before cutting opponents stones]))
(;W[kp]C[kh: hane at l3 is too agressive and does not pay off]

(;B[pq];W[oq];B[jq];W[lq];B[fq]C[kh: black can treat the stone lightly]

(;W[ec]C[kh: you could also opt to just take the corner territory]

(;B[bc]C[kh: cut only gives white more , just simply hane]))
(;B[he]C[kh: my first thought would be to separate white to attack]

(;W[jf]C[kh: corner is not as big as getting the stones out]
