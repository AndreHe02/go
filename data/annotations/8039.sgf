AB[pd][dp]C[simon [11k\]: hi

Hello Simon,

I'm your reviewer. You did not add any questions, that's why I commented, what I think is useful for you to know.
Generally speaking I would say, that you gave away some of your corners to easily. Especially the sequence in the bottom left was a huge loss.

Best regards,

;W[qo];B[qk];W[no];B[mq];W[rq]LB[qh:C][oo:A][kp:B]C[I think you should respond to White's move in the corner.
I think A, B or C ar possible. See variation for A. Playing at C prevents the pincer shown in the variation.]
(;B[ce]LB[lp:A]C[Now White has the chance to press down Black on the bottom at A and attack the right side. See Variation.]

(;B[ck]LB[co:A][fp:B][fq:C]C[The pincer is possible, but the Black formation is pretty low (on third line). That usually is not good, because White can press down. (White does so later starting with move 41.)
I would not pincer her. I suggest A, B or C. See variation for result after A.]
;W[fq];B[eo]C[Good.];W[cq]
(;B[gp]LB[cp:B][dq:A]C[This move is not good here. It ais for a center moyo, but you want to build something on the bottom, not in the center.
A or B are usual. A is better because left side is not so important because of the low formation of the black stones. See variation for result after A.]
;W[dq];B[gq]LB[dq:A]C[Now the bottom is much smaller then blocking directly at A.]

Black should continue at A, B or C.]
