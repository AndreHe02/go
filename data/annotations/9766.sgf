AB[gc][cg]C[Human strength is 15 Kyu.  Computer playing at level 3


Hi! I'm Derpi's Puzzles (DerpiPlays) and I will be reviewing this 9x9 game!]
;W[cc];B[dd]C[This move is a strengthening move for White. Not only does White get to make his stone stronger, he can also look forward to an invasion on the opposite start point.

Usually, Black gets the first move, (when white invades at 3-3). However, in this case, White gets the first move, and this is instead a joseki instead of invasion.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[gg]C[And there we go, White takes the beautiful chance to make invade.]

(;B[ff]C[Another strengthening move. Refrain from playing moves that don't get you much and strengthen your opponent.

Some other moves you can try are listed.];W[fg];B[gf]C[This is a very bad joseki mistake. As I had said before, White had the first move in which would have been an invasion.

The correct move is listed, and the variation can be found on eidogo.com.]

C[It would have been much better to block first. That way, if White defends the stone you just blocked, you can capture the other, and vice versa.]
;W[gh];B[fi];W[ih]
(;B[ig]C[This was a mistake. Although the White group is alive, black can still get much more by blocking. Including sente.

As you had said yourself, this was not the best move.];W[bh]
