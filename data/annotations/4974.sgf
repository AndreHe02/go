AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello. Thank you for asking me to review your game.
I have left comments about the game at the very last node.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me.];W[qn]
;B[ql];W[on];B[np];W[mn];B[nm]C[this nozoki neccesary? ok?

It is very agressive, forcing W to react, and strengthening him. It doesn't actually give B very much though. A move like Q13 or R5, which takes territory and strengthens your groups is probably better.]
;W[nn];B[jm];W[rp];B[qq];W[lq]C[how to react?

Please see the three variations where I discuss possible alternatives.]

(;B[mp];W[oq]C[and now? I was puzzled..

Now B has a problem.... suddenly, the corner group which was strong has become very weak. Your next move (connecting the stones) is ok only if you are sure you can save your group, otherwise you are adding more stones to a dead group. Perhaps sacrificing them for now by playing M4 to connect outside (and threaten M3 and thus to make some territory) is not a bad idea, see the variation]

(;B[op];W[nr];B[kr]C[ok?
This feels a bit strange... possibly timid. You seem to be changing strategies half way. your O4 group is weak, and you played stones to reinforce it, but now you are leaving it vulnerable to attack. While W didn't kill the group, its important to remember that killing a group is often not the point of an attack; the game is about making territory, not killing stones (though most people, me included, seem to like killing stones far too much).]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[pr];B[lr];W[mq];B[nq];W[mr];B[pq];W[qr]C[next I should have played s3 I suppose...

S3 is dangerous, it leads to a nasty fight between weak groups. And sinice he is a stronger player, thats probably what he wants. In a (high) handicap game, you should try keep your groups strong and connected, and you will win.]

(;B[ms];W[rq];B[lp];W[ns];B[or];W[os];B[kp];W[ls];B[gp];W[qd]
C[no hane?

I'm not exactly sure what you mean by that. But this is a standard probing move. W wants to see if you want to defend the corner or the side. I think your response at R15 was correct.]
;B[qe];W[pe]
(;B[oe]C[Atari ater a crosscut is almost always a bad idea. You will have too many cutting points to defend. Normally, a better response is to extend from the crosscut, i.e. something like P16, Q17, R14 or S15]
;W[pf];B[od];W[re];B[qg];W[qf]C[and now?

Perhaps something like R17? That will secure B a lot of territory. W is pretty secure in that area now, you should forget about trying to kill it. A move like you made (P13) just asks for more trouble as you are creating weak stones near a strong group.]
;B[og];W[pg];B[ph];W[of];B[oh];W[nf];B[md]C[This is a good idea, but because Q17 is still open, you may lose a lot of territory here later on.]
;W[cf];B[ch]C[This is an overplay. Clearly you are trying to pincer the C14 stone with this move, but note that you already have the D10 stone in place sort of creating a pincer already. A better move would have been somethin like C15 (which starts taking corner territory, and strengthening your D16 stone) or F17 or F16, all of which are "standard" (joseki) moves.]
;W[fc];B[ee]C[good!];W[cc];B[cd];W[dc];B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[fd]
;B[hd];W[fe]C[is there a way to prevent this "snakes" - I cannot close the enemy groups in :(

The best way is to practice lots :) Actually, when the opponent makes moves like this, its best to accept that you will lose some territory, and not play too close in. For example, to stop the O14 snake, you could play something like M13. To stop the F15 move, you would need to play something like G13 (which, in this context is the "wrong" move).

However, your next move is "correct", as it puts lots of pressure on C14.]
;B[ef];W[cn];B[cl];W[en];B[bo]C[This is a bit of a strange move. More normal is B4 or C5. See my comments at the end about attack and defense.]
;W[do]
(;B[co]C[here better play e4?

Probably yes. It would lead to some intense fighting, but with care, you should be able to kill him and take the corner.]
;W[ep];B[eq]C[Too aggressive. this leaves you with a cutting point (which he immediatly takes advantage of)]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[fq];B[er];W[fp];B[dr];W[go];B[hp];W[gl];B[hm]
;W[gm];B[gj];W[hl];B[il];W[hn];B[im];W[el]C[W is happy with this variation. While he lost the corner, he was able to live and take a bunch of territory in your center. Apart from saving the corner, B didn't get to make any profit from this exchange.]

;B[hg];W[eg];B[fh];W[dg]C[ouch... this is a big loss for B. As mentioned at my comments at the end, its because you leave too many cutting points open. If you learn to avoid that, you will get at least one or two stones stronger very fast.]

;B[ae];W[be];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[dl];B[ck];W[mm];B[ml]C[Again, too close, leaving a cutting point. I'm not sure what would be bette though. W is already in your area due to O14, so whatever you do, you will end up with very little territory in this part of the board.]

;W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[qj];W[qh];B[qi];W[rg];B[mg]C[By now, the status of pretty much all the areas of the board is decided, and the late middle game/early endgame starts.]
;W[rj];B[sk];W[ri];B[oj];W[rm];B[mf];W[ne];B[nd];W[me];B[le]
;W[jr];B[ir]C[You are now well into the endgame. The basic idea of the endgame is twofold
1) Make moves that keep sente (the initiative)
2) play big moves before little moves.

The two ideas are related, if you make a move, and the opponent can play elsewhere with a move that is worth more, your move is not sente. I will look at  a few examples of this for the rest of the review.]

So, in the endgame, white asks himself "where can I play that forces B to respond, allowing me to play again]
;W[bg]C[White chooses a move that will lose him the initiative, but he thinks its worth more points than the other moves on the board.]
;B[bh];W[af];B[fk]C[This is a good use of sente. perhaps H5 would have been better, as you could set up a ko (possibly), and thus keep sente]

[cr][hr][as][bs][cs][hs]C[Overall, you did not play badly. You made a few small mistakes that cost you a lot, but your endgame is relatively solid. The best suggestion i can make is that you practice a lot of life and death problems, these help you get a feel for shape which will probably be most beneficial at your level.

A few principles which might help your game:

Contact moves are for defense, not attack. When playing next to a stone, you end up forcing him to place more stones in the area. Since he got to play stones there first, he will be slightly stronger, meaning more liberties. To attack, you usually place stones at least one intersection away, leaving you with more room to manuever.

Don't leave too many cutting points in your shapes. This is probably your biggest weakness at the moment.

To stop "snakes" (also known as "squeezing the toothpaste"), play a bit far from your opponent's formations. Contact moves will not be able to stop him.]
)
(;B[ln]C[This is a bigger move, as it stops L6. However, it is not sente. in fact, black has very few sente moves left.]
))
(;B[ep]C[As you suggested, this is much better. W doesn't have much room to move now and his D5 group is looking very very weak.]

(;B[lp]C[I like this move... W now has two weak groups to take care of, allowing B to make territory while attacking. Spliting your oppenent's weak groups with your strong groups is usually a good idea in go.]

(;B[rq]C[I don't like this move too much. While it does mean that B will probably live, it feels too passive; W has complete freedom in choosing what to do to strengthen or link his groups.]
