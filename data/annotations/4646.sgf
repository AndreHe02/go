C[This was a teaching game I received, so I already had some useful comments from the other player during the game.

I am a beginner, My only ranking is from dragon go server, and it went from about 27 to about 20 kyu during the game (dgs is not for real time games, so it took a while). I played black.

White is 7kyu EGF.

Komi was 6.5.

``Hello, I'm Kim and I'll be reviewing this game for white.  I start all of my comments with `` to make them easy to identify.

I can be found playing on both KGS and DGS as phantom.  Feel free to ask for a teaching game on either server any time.

You can also reach me via email at gophantom@gmail.com.  Email me if you have any questions.]

;B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[dn];W[pe];B[eg];W[bj];B[bk]C[could I have done better than let this white group create a base so easily? I'm not so satisfied with the result.

``The thing to do to stop white from getting an easy base would have been to try a pincer.  (See variation.)]

(;W[ei];B[ek];W[gi];B[ik]C[This move feels good to me, but in the end cutting off the white group to the left didn't seem to pay off (I had to make too many moves near the center, which didn't earn me a lot of territory).

At this point in the game I seem to be behind in controlled side territory,

``This move does very little for you.  As you noted, it doesn't do a lot in terms of building anything for you in the center.  The other problem with it is that it just isn't very big.

The reason that it doesn't really help you make territory in the center is that there isn't much territory to be had in the center.  One go proverb goes as far as to say, "There is no territory in the center."  While that is a bit of a hyperbole, it is important to remember that the center is not as big as it looks, and it is very difficult to make any territory at all.  The corners are the best place to make territory, followed by the sides.  So, leave the center until there are no move big gains to be made on the sides and in the corners.

So, where else to go?  (See the variation for your options.)]

(;W[lc]C[and this makes things worse.. What should I do to recover the disadvantage?

``Although white did get some points for playing this move, it's nice because you don't have to respond to it.  There's not much else for white to gain by playing in that area because you're already pretty strong there.  So, you can look for a move somewhere else on the board.  Three out of the four moves that I showed in my last variation are still there.]
;B[kd];W[ld];B[ke]C[I thought I was creating a sort of framework to the left, but with white G11 straight in the middle of it it wasn't worth much territory.

``Good observation.  Frameworks don't really do you much good if an enemy group is already forcing it's way in.  Right now, you can pretty much consider the top left to be yours.  But, when trying to judge how much territory you've claimed, it's best not to give the center much value.]
;W[mf];B[qn]LB[qn:A][gq:C][nq:B]C[Here I was trying to recover from the disadvantage in terms of territory along the sides, so I invaded. Any other suggestions? A few that I can think of are

A reduction around G3
An invasion around O3

I now think O3/O4 would have been better. Even though that side is less open (K3 is closer by) I am less deeply into white's mojo. Also white cannot let me build a wall between k3 and Q4, or K3 would be weakened too much, and cut off from other white groups.

``The moves you suggested seem to be the best moves on the board, and you seem to understand their pros and cons pretty well.

I actually like A the best because, as you pointed out, it is more open.  That extra breating space should ultimately leave you with the most options.  It's important to remember when white pincers, that, not only can you jump out and work with your center stones, you can also push your way into that corner.

B could work well too, but I'm not sure how white will respond to it, so it's hard for me to say how well it will work.  You are right that isolating K3 will work well, but you should keep in mind that white can always attack from that direction to make that stone stronger.  If white can do that, connecting won't be as important for white.]
;W[ql];B[on];W[mq];B[pk]C[``I like this move because it should work well with your center stones, but it seems like it ended up being a little too easy to cut.

Don't forget that the bottom right corner is still up for grabs.  Something like S4 would help you find room for an eye or two along the side.  The 3-3 invasion at R3 is an option too.]

;W[qq];B[ig];W[cp];B[cq]C[here I didn't want to give up the corner

``You made a good decision here.  White shouldn't be able to live in that area.]
;W[eo];B[go]C[``You're still doing a good job of limitting white's space to run in this area so far.  White still shouldn't be able to live in there.]
;W[bc];B[cb]TR[jo]C[``Responding here isn't really neccessary.  This would be a good time to look for another big move.

Something like K5 could be pretty big at this point, because It's a good multi-purpose move.  It blocks white off from expanding up into the center.  It's also nice because, although C4 and F5 are pretty much dead, they still have a lot of aji, and might might want to use that aji to push in from the right.  A move around K5 would also give you some strenght to fight off an attack like that.]
;W[fm]
(;B[fl]C[``This contact move just encourages white to jump out, escaping your clutches.  When you make contact with a stone, you give it a chance to get stronger, so making contact with a stone that you want to attack is usually a bad idea.

Notice that white doesn't have much room to make eyes in there, so you should have a good chance of killing those stones.  If you go with a lighter move white will have trouble getting out.  (See the variation for my suggestion.)

Just remember that once you kill those stones, white might still be able to make some use of their aji.]
;W[hm];B[im]C[Perhaps here I was trying to obtain too much? I could probably have succeded at cutting off F7 from H7, killing the 3 stones to the left, but I didn't want to suffer such a deep reduction to what I considered my area of influence.

``You were right in thinking of that area as yours at first.  As I said in my previous comments, you should have been able to stop white by playing differently on your last move.

At this point, it's no longer possible to kill all of those white stones.  Cutting at this point would be a pretty good idea.  Making contact with white again certainly leads to problems.]
;W[hn];B[en];W[in];B[jm];W[jo];B[nn];W[dh]C[I had been wanting to play D12! but I didn't get the time... Should I have played it instead of the honte at O6? I wasn't able to decide whether I would end up in sente after D12, so I played honte instead.

``If you wanted it so much, you should have gone for it.  :)

This move is certainly sente.  There's a proverb that says "Even a moron connects at a peep" (which is what D12 would have been for you). If you played at D12 and your opponent didn't connect, you could have cut.  So, white shouldn't ignore it.  After you get D12, you can move on.

O6 was a good move, but it could have waited.];B[df];W[ce];B[nh]
C[perhaps there were more profitable moves available near the sides? At least playing more to the right would have reduced white's territory along the side.

``I'm not sure where to the right you are thinking.  At this point, there are very few moves left along the sides.

I think the most profitable moves right now are the ones where you keep sente.  You have a lot of ground to make up.  The other thing to consider right now would be an invasion of some sort, but unfortunately, I don't see any good spots for invasion.]
;W[pg];B[ip];W[jp]
(;B[jn]C[here I messed up tactically, as I soon found out. I think J5 instead of this would have forced K6 (threatening to cut)

perhaps J12?

How do I deal with a live enemy stone which can reduce my mojo in several directions?
(right, connecting to L12, up, and down threatening to connect)

It looks like a lose-lose situation, because if I block it on one side I make it stronger to attack on the other side..

``First of all, I don't think there's as much to be lost in this area as you seem to think.  Second, your moves don't have to make white stronger if you don't play contact moves.

Figuring out how to handle a situation like this involves taking quite a few things into consideration.

(;AE[fh]LB[gh:C][ii:B][hj:A]C[``The first thing to do in a situation like this is to look at where white can go and which way would hurt you the most.

If white wants to try to connect with those stones towards the bottom, he might start with A.  Notice that there really isn't much room to go downward.  So white doesn't have much to gain there.  Also notice that if black does keep white from going downward, there aren't many points of territory for him there either.  There are maybe three points or so for black there, and it would take a lot of moves to get them all.

Now consider B.  If nothing else, black has move potential territory between B and his other stones.  B is also scary because it threatens to connect to K12, and letting white connect to K12 would mean a pretty big loss for black.  So, we can say B is a dangerous direction.

Finally, there's C.  This is another direction where white can't get far.  This time the danger is that white could get cut for trying to jump out more.   C is a little more dangerous to black than A because it starts to push into that territory at the top, but it doesn't threaten as much as B.

So, it seems like stopping B is the best way to start.

Now the important thing to think about is how to stop white's expansion.  The idea is to find moves that stop white's progress without making him stronger.  For this, I suggest avoiding contact moves.  B itself would be a good point to start.

Situations like this are good places to practice your reading skills.  Think about the tightest possible move you could make, then consider your opponent's response that pushes the most.  If it looks like your opponent is going to be able to keep pushing at you, consider something looser and less dangerous.

Try playing out some moves from this point on your own and see what seems to work best, keeping in mind that contact moves can lead to trouble.]

(;AB[hl]CR[hl]LB[gi:A][hm:B]C[``If your goal here is to keep A and B seperated, your best option is the circled stone.  This still isn't sente, but it gets straight to the point.  If white wants to push from B now, he won't be able to get far.  This is also nice because it keeps your groups nicely connected.]

(;B[io];W[jn];B[iq]C[``This is certainly a better result, but it feels very cramped.]

))
(;AE[gi][ik];W[gi]LB[mc:A][qn:D][hq:B][nq:C]SQ[jg][hk]C[``I see a couple of spots on the board that look like they would be nice to have.

Let me start with the squared spots.  I wouldn't suggest playing a move in the center for the reasons I went over before, but if I was going to play in the center, I'd go with one of these two.  I include them to give you an idea of what sort of move you should play when the time comes to go for the center.  They are a little lighter than the move you went with and work to limit white's range of motion.

A and B are the type of move I usually consider first when I'm looking for a place to play along the sides.  The reason they are good moves is that they are places that both sides might want to expand to.

I prefer B over A for two related reasons.  First of all, if black goes with B white will want to respond.

In a situation like this though, I usually look for other moves.  The groups that you would be expanding by playing A and B don't really need more stones.  So, A and B are basically just points, and they don't give you enough points to really make up for the advantage white seems to be gaining.

Instead, I'd consider and invasion like C or D.  Eventually, you do invade at D.  I'll go into the pros and cons of those moves at that point.  Also note that the situations that can come up are similar to the ones created when white played C14 at move 10.]

[cf:2][ch:B]TR[ci]C[``When white approaches 1 with 2 like this, black has a few possible responses - protect the top with a stone around A, pincer with B, or tenuki and play somewhere else on the board entirely.  The trick is picking the best option, and that always involves looking at the other stones on the board.

Because black already has a lot of stones in this area, black can certainly afford to play elsewhere.  But, I'd rather find a good local response.  Keep the initiative in this area and deal with the rest of the board later.

You went with the stone near A.  This is actually a pretty good move because it helps build up the top.  But, as soon as you make a move like A, you've given white the chance to make that strong base by playing at the triangle.

If you want to stop white from getting that base, you need to use a pincer of some sort to prevent white from playing at the triangle.  B seems like the ideal move to accomplish that.  Not only does it put preasure on 2 and prevent an easy base, but it also give black a base.  (See variation for more.)]
;B[ch]LB[cc:B][ef:A]C[``This looks pretty good for black.  Now white is really going to have to do some work.  White has 2 common responses that you can expect.

A is a 1-point jump.  By extending to A, white can seperate the black stone on the top from the black stones on the side.  If white choses this move, black will have a good excuse to strengthen his stones on the top.  (See first variation.)

White might also decide to go with a 3-3 invation at B.  This will give black a chance to develop a strong wall, but guarentee white some territory in the corner.  (See second variation.)]

Playing at A will cut white off from that intial triangle stone and keep white in the corner.

B, on the other hand, will let white connect to that Triangle stone and get out of that corner.  But, it will also give black an excuse to build a wall facing the square stone.  My reason for chosing B would be to build that wall.
