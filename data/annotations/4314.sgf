;B[he]LB[kc:B][kd:B][jc:B][jd:A]C[>B's move is unusual and ineffective; should be at or near the 4-4 point, A.   As a general practice, ALL opening moves should be made in corners, at least until a player has risen to a level where he KNOWS why it might be a good idea to play otherwise in peculiar circumstances.

>The "lower" (closer to edge) 3-4 points marked B are also good openers, but beginners should learn the 4-4 first.]
;W[dd]LB[jd:A]C[I was trying to mark off corner territory here. -- Jon

>Sound play, although A (capitalizing on B's weak first move) is better because it both stakes out territory and, by being closer, threatens B's stone.]
;B[gg]C[>Wrong.  B needs to focus on the corners, where is it easier, faster and more efficient tto make territory.

>As an exercise, experiment for yourself to see how many stones it takes to enclose, say, 10 points of territory:
     a) in the corner
     b) along the side
     c) in the center];W[dj]C[I ignored Ben's moves and tried to block off another corner. -- Jon

>Perfect.];B[gj];W[gd]LB[jj:C][jc:B][jd:A]C[Here I'm trying to mark off the top side, and counter Ben's influence from H9 and G7. -- Jon

>OK, but playing in a corner would be even more efficient and I'd personally favor playing at A, B or C.]
;B[eg];W[dg]LB[cg:A]C[Here I'm responding to the threat from E7 and trying to claim more of the left side. -- Jon

>There is an elementary flaw here, and that is that you're trying to block him with a contact move (blocking at A would be better). See variation from next move.]

(;B[jj]LB[dg:8]C[>At least B is staking out some territory now; that's good.  But  B could also attack your 8 stone in ways that strengthen his position (variation); that's why 8 wasn't such a good move.]
;W[jd]C[Here, since Ben hasn't claimed anything on the top, I'm marking off things there. -- Jon

>Yes, good, although the important thing is not the top but the corner.]
;B[jg]LB[id:B][je:A]C[>Better for B to play at A or B.  The move as played lets W get too far into B's knickers on  move 12.]
;W[kf]C[Since the corners and sides all have stone placed, I'm doing a mini-invasion of the right side, backed up by the stone in K10. -- Jon

>Not really an invasion, since you're not moving IN the opponent's territory.  Rather, it's an extension.]
;B[ke]LB[kf:12][jg:11][kg:A]C[>B 13 has some potential but W can kill this stone with accurate play.  That means W's mover 12 stone will live, and W's territory in the upper RH corner will encroach further into B's. It is better for B to play at A, which does two things -- stakes out B territory below and protects B's move 11 stone, which is weak.

>Always look for moves that accomplish more than one thing.]
;W[je]LB[jf:A][kf:12][ke:13]C[I'm threatening to connect back up with L8. -- Jon

>Better to think of it in terms of isolating B's 13 stone rather than connecting to your 12.  Your move seems to accomplish this, but there is a risk that B may try to cut you at A.]
;B[le];W[lf]LB[jf:A]C[I'm now trying to fence Ben's group off.  -- Jon

>What if B replies by cutting at A?]
(;B[lc]LB[jf:A]C[>See variation for B cut at A.];W[kc]LB[jf:A]
C[I'm still pushing him towards the corner. -- Jon

>But B can still cut at X.  Do you need to be concerned?]
(;B[kd]LB[jf:A]C[>Instead, B could try cutting at A, and that's tricker now because his stones have more liberties (variation).]
;W[lb]LB[me:A]C[Now I think I have a nice wall around him, and can possibly squeeze him into an area too small for life. -- Jon

>You had a better move, though, the atari at A.];B[mf];W[mg]
C[I view N8 as threatening to break out, and I need to contain it. -- Jon]
;B[me];W[mc]C[Now I've got him.  He's short of liberties and I'm going in for the kill. -- Jon]
;B[lg];W[ld]C[I have to abandon N7, but I think I can reduce his liberties enough even if he takes N7. -- Jon]
;B[jf]LB[mh:A]C[>B should play at A instead, ensuring life.]
;W[md]C[He doesn't take N7, so I pounce and take his group before it's too late. -- Jon

>Actually, it was too late for you (see previous variation), but B missed that.]

(;B[id]C[>Big mistake; B needs to prevent W's dragon from extending into the lower right (variation).]
;W[lh]C[Here I'm trying to constrict his remaining stones even more. -- Jon]
;B[kg]
(;W[fk]LB[lh:30]C[Now I feel I can play away from that group.  I try to invade the bottom. -- Jon

>OK, but you're overlooking a better move.  Because of your move 30 stone W can jump into the lower-right corner, which otherwise would be the only decent territory B could claim (variation).]
;B[ki];W[hl]LB[mk:A]C[I don't think L5 requires immediate response, so I keep invading the bottom. -- Jon

>Here the move to A, called a "monkey jump", would be more useful. But your move is certainly playable as long as the 34 stone retains some potential.  As it happened, though, you let B cut it off.]
;B[mi];W[mh]C[I'm afraid of M6 being cut off from the rest of my stones, so I play at N6 before he can. -- Jon]
;B[li];W[mf]LB[kk:B][kh:A]C[Now that I can connect up at N8, I don't worry about those stones dying any more. -- Jon

>You don't need to play 38 yet.  It's a gote move, and an optional one at that.  You can wait until B plays atari at A, then play 38.

>You can invade at B, the 3-3 point, and make territory in the corner -- also prevent B from making it!  (variation)]
;B[gl];W[gk]LB[hl:34][hk:A]C[Here I want to cut G2 off to kill it. -- Jon

>OK, but you've also got to protect against the cut at A.  Otherwise, your 34 stone is in danger.]
;B[ck];W[dk]C[Here I'm trying to take the invader -- C3 -- and restrict the territory he can build in the corner. -- Jon]
;B[dl]
(;W[el]LB[cj:A]C[This seems like a good way of fencing him in, especially since it's supported by D3 and F3. -- Jon

>It's tempting to keep black from connecting across the bottom but in fact the outcome would be better for W if you blocked at a instead (variation).]
;B[cl];W[cj]C[Still fencing him in.  --- Jon

>OK, but at this point you should realize that B will probably live in the corner.  If your opponent is going to live, maybe you can make him "live small".]
;B[bj];W[bi]C[Fencing. -- Jon];B[ak];W[dm]LB[bi:48]C[>Nice idea, but you need to be concerned with protecting your move 48 stone.  This is a typical vulnerability, one that you will learn to anticipate and defend.]
;B[ci];W[ch]LB[bh:A]C[Trying to get him in a ladder. -- Jon

>But you see what happens, don't you?  B's next move lets him connect underneath, and extend his low-living stones up into what should have been your exclusive territory.  Playing at A was probably your simplest and best defense.]
;B[bh];W[di];B[ai];W[ci];B[bg];W[cf]C[Here I think he has a chance of escaping up the left side, so I'm building to push him to the edge. -- Jon]
;B[bf];W[be];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bc]C[I'm afraid he'll play B10 and threaten A10. -- Jon]
;B[ce];W[bd];B[df];W[cg];B[ah]MA[bh][bg][bf][af][ae]C[>Very sharp of B to see this!  Had he let you play there, he'd lose the five marked stones.]

(;W[de]LB[kk:A][ef:B]C[Here I see the chance to do a double atari, so I do. -- Jon

>First, you are right to be concerned now about making two definite eyes for W's group on the left.  Second, a double-atari is nice, but there are bigger moves on the board -- e.g., A.  Also, by a single atari at B you'd kill both of B's marked stones, if you wanted to do that.]
;B[ef];W[fi]LB[kk:A][ic:B]C[I think I've got him locked down where he isn't going to get a lot of territory in the lower left, so I guess I was trying to build up influence in the lower middle. -- Jon

>Yes, but A and B are more important.  W 72 is not worth much. At best, you make a couple of points of territory here that B woud otherwise have.]
;B[hk];W[hj]LB[hl:34][il:A]C[>No, no, no!  You must extend to A to defend your 34 stone, which is a key part of your base for projecting threats into the lower-right corner.]
;B[ik]LB[hl:34][gl:39]C[>Now W's 34 stone is dead and B's 39 stone is alive.  The lower-right corner which should have been W's is now solidly B's.]
;W[gi];B[il];W[kh]C[I know these stone are safe, so I'm seeing what mischief I can get into by bringing a line of them out. -- Jon]
;B[hi];W[fj];B[ij]
(;W[gj]C[>No need to fill this; at worst it is a half-point ko that W can afford to lose.  W is still substantially ahead.  Personally, I'd defend at A here, then when B takes the ko, extend to B as a ko threat (variation).]
;B[gh];W[ff]C[>??  As you can see, B attacks this weak move easily and effectively.]
;B[fe];W[fh];B[fg];W[jh];B[ih];W[ji];B[ii];W[kj]C[I got a sense that I could cut off L5-N5.  I'm not sure how I would have responded if he had played M4, but I thought it was worth a shot, or else I'd have to concede the lower right. -- Jon

>Perfect, nothing to criticize!];B[lk];W[lj]C[Here I knew he made a mistake with M3, so I wanted to lock up his group. -- Jon]
;B[eh];W[ei]C[Both groups were getting a little low on liberties, so I wanted to join them and start to build some eyes. -- Jon]
;B[cm];W[em];B[dc];W[ec]C[I felt I could pen him up so he couldn't form life in the upper left. -- Jon]
;B[cc];W[db]C[Now he had even less room. -- Jon];B[fm];W[ic]
C[I didn't think I need to respond to F1, and I didn't want him to invade the top again, so I was shoring up my strength there. -- Jon]
;B[hm];W[kk]LB[fl:A]C[I was trying to reduce the amount of territory he could make in the bottom right. -- Jon

>Not just reduce his, but make your territory as well.  Good shot!

LB[ll:A]C[I don't remember why I felt the need to play N4 right then...maybe I wanted to push more into the corner, and didn't want to run out of liberties? -- Jon
