asobu -  I'm pretty sure R14 would have been better];W[ne]C[R14 now would be e good but C10 is a good move, try and make BIG moves when you can in the opening.]

;W[op];B[oq];W[np]C[better to just continue along 3 rd line at O3]
;B[mq]C[
asobu - I think O3 would have been better];W[nq];B[nr]C[nasty cuts now to handle!]
;W[or];B[pq];W[mr];B[pr];W[ns]C[this cost you about 20 points!]
;B[rr]C[good move essential for life];W[ko]C[nice block by w]

;W[ph];B[lh]C[not good makes a  nasty lump of stones J18 and then F15 threatening to cut off the central w stones might work for you. Still J18 is big leaving open ends is hard near  the end as it costs a lot of easy points.]
