C[I lost this game by quite a big margin, but i got the impression that i only lost because of one or two loosing plays. I'd like to have my thoughts reviewed as well, as the game itself...

Thanks in advance!

Velirun: 

Hi Simon!

My impression is that, yes, you lost the game due to a few very large errors.  I will point them out as we go along.

Also, I will attempt to point out your opponent's mistakes as well, so that you may learn from them too.]
;B[pp]C[jeanne [16k\]: bonjour];W[dc];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc]
(;W[ce]TR[pj][qj]C[Velirun: First mistake - there are certain crucial points in the opening you must become aware of.  The first and easiest to deal with is the space in front of a "shimari" or corner enclosure.  Black made one in the upper right.

Velirun: Instead of making your own, you need to take one of the marked points.  They are the biggest on the board.  If black plays there, he has a very ideal framework.

Velirun: See variations from the last move for possibilities.]
;B[cn]C[Velirun: Black's mistake - he should immediately take one of the points mentioned before.]
;W[cj]C[I was quite happy to be able to play the pincer there... should have been closer to the black stone ?

Velirun: This is a matter of taste, really.  I think I personally would have made a one-space low pincer, or a two space high pincer.]
;B[fq];W[eo]C[better to take the corner i guess... that weak group troubled me all along...

Velirun:  This move works.  Joseki is black 3-3 now.];B[dl]
;W[dj]C[Velirun:  I'm not so sure about this move.  If you want to attack those two stones, you should jump to E10 instead.]
;B[cq]C[Velirun:  Black takes 3-3...];W[cp]C[Velirun:  Correct direction to block.  Do you know why?]
;B[dq]
(;W[jd]C[better to save lower left first i guess, with something like e9, f7, e8 etc.

Velirun:  Big mistake.  I would say this is the most fatal mistake this game.  Your group is not so weak, when compared to C6-D8 stones.

Velirun:  I suggest you press the corner black stones with G4.  This will keep him low, and you can return to make a stronger attack on the other two stones.  See variation.

Velirun:  However, if you wish to extend from your shimari in the upper left, this is the right distance.  K17 or K16 is a matter of taste.]
;B[lc];W[jc]C[Velirun:  Still should press and attack!];B[pj]
C[Velirun:  Black finally takes the big point.  You should *still* press at G4.]
;W[jj]C[should have attacked blacks weak stones first, i guess, again,  with something like e9, f7, etc. ... could have been a very big follow up.

fundamental error ?

Velirun:  YES!  This move puts some loose pressure on the weak stones... but I know you can do better.]
;B[fl]C[Velirun:  Black escapes.  You should *still* build some thickness with G4.]
;W[go]C[Velirun:  Not a bad idea, but black can come up to the fourth line with H4.]
;B[hp]C[Velirun:  And he does.];W[ho]C[this running out has a very bad taste to it. I thought i could build up against the lower black stones, first. but i guess it was not a real threat...

Velirun:  It is a real threat.  I would push one more line, then jump to enclose the black stones.  It could get tough to kill them though, and black has profited a lot on the bottom.]
;B[bk];W[bj]C[Velirun:  Why block?  What is the worst black can do on the lower edge?  Enclose him first, and make him sweat.  While he fights for life, you can make the entire upper left your solid territory.]
;B[gj]C[white shouldnt have let that happen i guess...

Velirun:  I think now you are too threatened on the bottom to fight effectively.]

(;W[eg]TR[gj][fl]C[too timid ?

Velirun:  I believe so.  I would turn my attention to another area, and aim at cutting black's knight's move somewhere in the future.  Perhaps push at J5, hane at J4, then jump to enclose the black stones?  See variation.]
;B[il]C[Velirun:  Now you're in trouble...];W[nq]C[k5 better ? or would give that too much territory ?

Velirun:  There is another proverb: urgent points before big points.  A move like this gives black two targets to attack, and he can profit greatly if he understands how to attack both at once.  I think black should act now in the middle bottom, with something like K4 or L4.]
;B[kq]C[Velirun:  He has the right idea, but the fourth line is better.]

(;W[iq]C[Velirun:  No good.  Always think about your follow-ups!  It is difficult to live... perhaps E2 instead of J3?  See variations on the previous move.]

C[is that move really that good or am i just soo bad at defense ?

Velirun:  In a two-space diagonal "connection", you should always worry about this point.  I'm not sure how to respond here as white, to be honest.]
