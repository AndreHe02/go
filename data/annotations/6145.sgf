C[Hello Reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review my game!

I've included my thoughts on why I made some moves and questions on some specific scenarios. I'd especially appreciate general areas I should work on.

Thank you again!

Tuomas:
Hello, I am Tuomas from Finland, currently 5 kyu. I play fast and think little, I have aggressive style and bad manners. When I comment a game I don't concentrate on variations or trick moves or even joseki sequences. I don't believe anyone will learn anything if I make huge variations. Instead I try to comment the strategy and what is going on in the game. It is hard but rewarding for both of us if I manage to do it well. Here I go.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[ec];B[cd];W[gd]LB[cc:2][de:1][cf:4][df:3]
C[Tuomas:
I could not find this from my joseki books so I must assume it is a "bad" move. That book has only basic josekis though. Instead it gives four alternatives: 1 aims for influence and presses black down, 2 goes for the corner, 3 is for trouble (it is the taisha joseki) and 4 for pincer.

Many people practice taisha joseki and then play 3-4 opening to lure opponents into it. Then they try to win the game with the first corner.

Here I would suggest '1' to build a wall towards upper right corner. You can observe how usefull that stone would have been later in this game.]
;B[db]C[Would the variation have been better?

Tuomas:
I don't think so, the way it was played in game left black corner more open so white will have more alternatives there. White shape is similar in both variations. This black stone makes those two white stones look weak.]

(;W[eb]C[Tuomas:
Bad shape for white.];B[ch]LB[cg:1]C[Tuomas:
Black shape is thin so it could be wiser to play at 1.];W[mc]
LB[nc:1]C[Tuomas:
Always play 1 instead of this. In every game where I have seen this it has been trouble. The difference with these two is minimal in top side and huge in the corner. With this black can invade at 3-3 and live. With 1 the best black can get from the corner is a ko-fight.]
;B[jp];W[qj]LB[pj:1]C[Tuomas:
Current situation is that both have only frameworks and no actual territory. Black has three corners and two sides. White has one corner and two sides. Black has lead but that is normal in early game.

White could consider playing this at 1 instead to stress the center.]
;B[qm]LB[qn:1]C[Tuomas:
I will again suggest that his move should not be used. Play 1 instead.]
;W[qq]C[Is this too early?

Tuomas:
Yes, now black will build huge wall towards the left corner and white will have hard time with it later in the game.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[cq]LB[dn:1]
[nr:2]C[Tuomas:
The idea of this stone is to take the corner. But here black has huge potential on the sides and this move does not support that potential well. I think that normal corner enclosure with  1 would have been better.

Also black can't really ignore the white moves in bottom right corner. White can break through the black wall by playing at 2 and reduce the black area in bottom side.]

(;W[cl];B[cn];W[ci];B[bi];W[di];B[dh];W[bj];B[ai];W[aj]LB[em:1]
C[Tuomas:
Jumping out would be better in this case. The last thing white wants is to be closed in in the side and forced to live small. Moves around 1 are huge because they force white to live or run and build black framework.]
;B[bh];W[bm];B[bn];W[gq]LB[go:C][eq:B][iq:A]C[Here I figured he'd either try and take my base or lock me in. I could either run or fight for life.

Tuomas:
It is true that in this situation white should be able to run or live. The only trouble is the weak white group at left side. If black plays A and forces white to run towards upper side the the white side group could end up in mortal danger. In worst case black can launch a splitter attack against two separated white groups.]
;B[jq];W[eq];B[fp]LB[en:3][fo:2][dr:1]C[Tuomas:
Here it would be better to force white to run. By taking the base with for example 1, white would have to jump to 2 and then black start the splitter attack with 3. Then white would have to run with bottom group while black prepares attack against the side group.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[gp];B[fq]
(;W[fr];B[fo];W[er];B[go];W[dq];B[co];W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[ar]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq];B[ei];W[cj]LB[eh:2][ek:1]C[Tuomas:
With no space to live it is time to run. Play 1, try to make good shape, run for your life and sacrifice those stones that seem too hard to keep alive. Then later try to cut at 2 to make a counter attack.]
;B[cm];W[bl]C[Tuomas:
Let that one stone go, run for your life.];B[dk];W[ej];B[dj]
;W[fi];B[ck]TR[eh]C[I'm pretty sure this was a mistake. If he connected there's not much I  can do.

Tuomas:
True, black must connect here. Even if white manages to live black will gain strength that he will need to destroy the white framework in upper right corner.]
;W[eh];B[eg]C[Tuomas:
Here the game will be lost for the first time. Black plays passively and allows white to build strong wall towards center. This wall works well with white framework and gives white a winning position.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[bk];B[ek];W[fk];B[dl];W[dm];B[el];W[fl];B[em]
;W[fm];B[en]C[Tuomas:
Nice wall :D.

Current situation is: Black has one corner, one shared corner and one side framework. White has one small corner, one shared corner and one huge 1/3 board framework.]
;W[dc]LB[qc:1]C[Tuomas:
Wrong director. That corner is not interesting at the moment. I bet white 1 would make black think hard. It takes away a huge reduction and fortifies white framework. After that it would be very hard for black to invade. Very often when black invades in this kind of situation he tries someting wild and thinks "if it fails I can always take the corner with 3-3". Prevent it and he loses the backup plan.]
;B[cb];W[cc];B[bc];W[dd];B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe]
;B[qc]LB[qg:1][gh:3][gj:2]TR[qj]C[Tuomas:
This is almost useless at the moment as it only makes the 4-4 stone work as it is supposed. White will seal this invasion in the corner and complete his framework. 

Attack somewhere around 1 that would separate the single white stone would give better result I think. Black could attack it and ruin the white framework while doing that. Black could also aim to use peep at 2 and perhaps even the peep at 3 to gain advantage later in the game. Black can always use the 3-3 later, or if white blocks it black will get one stone more for center fight.

Some people like to play safe territory but I always prefer dynamic position over territory. I don't like to play stones like this that takes lot of points but will not affect the game later. I prefer playing active stones even if they take less points in short term.]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[pc];B[qb]LB[rb:1]C[Tuomas:
It is quite common to play 1 in this situation. The idea is that it gives better shape even if white plays atari. And if white plays the atari he still have to protect the attacking stone.]
;W[re];B[sd];W[se];B[sb]LB[pb:1]C[Tuomas:
Just play 1 to close the side with sente.];W[rc];B[sc];W[ra]
;B[rb];W[pb];B[qa];W[ho]LB[oj:1][lk:3][nk:2]C[Trying to create influence in the center. Did that do anything or just add a weak stone and strengthen black?

Tuomas:
This does not build center at all. Perhaps on of 1, 2 or 3 but I am really bad with these.]
;B[hp];W[nk];B[nm]LB[jj:1]C[Tuomas:
This is not enough. Black should play harder and attack somewhere around 1. The "I destroy your territory - you destroy mine" deal is good for black because he has less to lose.]
;W[lk];B[kn]C[Tuomas:
Too little, too slow. W+R.];W[lm];B[ln];W[mm];B[mn];W[il]LB[nr:1]
C[Tuomas:
Black lost a lot with this exchange. He is losing the game.

Remember the tesuji at 1 that will wipe most of this territory in bottom?]
;B[im];W[hm]LB[jl:1]C[Tuomas:
Don't take risks here, just play solid 1 and see what black wants to do. After this black should play the 1 and push to center.]
;B[hn];W[in];B[io];W[jm]C[Tuomas:
Ponnuki at center is pretty much last thing black wants to see at this point, W+R.]
;B[jn];W[rn]LB[qf:1][pk:2]C[At this point I know I'm far ahead, so I'm just playing small now.

Tuomas:
Bad idea, or at least totally wrong direction. That framework is strong but you can still make it stronger. It makes no difference if you make 2 or 10 points with this group, but that framework will make the difference. And there is still room for a fight. For example 1 or 2 will remove one weakness from white wall.]
;B[rm];W[oq]C[Tuomas:
You missed the best attack. Now this area is black territory.]

;B[pn];W[pa];B[ic];W[jd]LB[kc:1]C[Tuomas:
White has stong walls all around so it is propably better to cut black from the side and let him jump to center.]

;B[ka];W[fa];B[ga];W[ia];B[ri];W[rj]LB[qi:1]C[Tuomas:
You don't need to kill this stone. You will win the game by playing at 1.]
;B[qh]
(;W[qe];B[rg];W[qi];B[sh];W[qg]LB[pg:1][ph:2]C[Tuomas:
This is too weak stone. If you try to kill a group with this kind of moves you will have a lot of trouble. It does take eye but you must defend it soon and that gives initiative to your opponent. I would play 1 and if black makes the eye his group will die after 2.]
;B[pg];W[qf];B[pi];W[oh];B[ph];W[pk];B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[mh]
;B[mg];W[js]C[Tuomas:
Don't get greedy. You have no reason to ignore black here. Just play one more stone and it will be W+R.]
;B[ks];W[is];B[lr];W[ed];B[gc];W[hd];B[fc];W[fd];B[lh];W[ni]
;B[lf];W[kg];B[ne];W[me];B[mf];W[of]LB[nd:1]C[Tuomas:
Another attack with weak stone. Weak stones can't capture, trust me. To kill a group every stone that takes part of the attack must be strong. If they are not the attack will turn around and collapse. You could try 1 to make your shape stronger. Black can get one eye but he still needs the other.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[km];W[ll];B[im]LB[jl:1]C[Tuomas:
Black 1 would have been better.];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[gm];W[hl]
;B[pf]C[Tuomas:
Now observe how black attacks the weak attacker.];W[oe];B[nd]
;W[nc];B[od]C[Tuomas:
You can let black capture these as he would not get two eyes with it.]
;W[pe];B[md];W[le];B[lc];W[ld];B[kc];W[mb]LB[nf:1]C[Tuomas:
Cut your loses, kill with 1, let that other group live and win the game with W+R.]
;B[nf];W[kd]LB[oc:1]C[Tuomas:
By playing 1 white could still have a chance. He should be able to kill the black top group and the side black group would still have hard time in getting two eyes. Play it through and see how it would turn out.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[la];W[ma];B[na];W[nb];B[sf]C[Tuomas:
Game over, B+R. Go is a wonderful game.];W[fb];B[rf]C[Seriously screwed up somewhere there.

Tuomas:
Attack with weak groups collapsed. You had to defend one weak stone and that made second one weak and while you defended that one your one wall became weak and when you don't cut your loses you will lose.

The game of Go is about winning. And you need to win your own greed, stubborness thirst for revenge and many other weaknesses to win the game. Always when something major changes happen take some time, look at the board, estimate the score and then make a plan.]
;W[cf];B[dg]C[Tuomas:
This corner is juicy. I throw in some variations but stydy this corner yourself to find different attacks. Excellen study material here.]

What areas do you think are my weakest and should work on?

Thank you,

Tuomas:
White had two major weakness in this game: First he did not pay attention to the overall situation. This gave black the winning framework at start, made white to go for unnecessary kill at right side and prevented white from letting a dead group live in upper side. The second weakness was the way white attacked. White used weak stones to attack and that can lead to serious results. It can be even better to fail with strong attack that succeed with weak attack because afterwards that weakness can come to haunt you seriously.

So pay more attention to overall situation and try to keep your attacking stones stronger.]
