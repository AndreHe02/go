C[dear reviewer,   after the first few moves i felt uncomfortable and didn´t know what to do.
the rest of the game i had the feeling of not knowing what to do.  i´m (w) normally a bit stronger than black, but in this game i had the feeling of totally not knowing was going on.
maybe you can show me how to deal with a big and impressing moyo such as black had built after a few moves.

thanks for your work,   Duumvir];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]
TR[qj]C[tanguy:
hi,
this is a standard Kobayashi style fuseki.
White's natural answer is to stop the extension from black's enclosure.
i give you some peacefull continuations...]
(;W[jc]TR[qj]CR[je]C[tanguy:
i do not like this move because black's extension is still possible
and because it is too low: it let the capping reduction at O]

(;B[jp]TR[pj]C[tanguy:
i prefer delta for black]
(;W[dj]TR[pj]C[tanguy:
This is a mistake you must play near delta
in this position (see variation).]
(;B[jj]CR[je]TR[pj]C[this is an interesting move because of the possible reduction at O
but i still prefer the "hi" delta]
(;W[qj]TR[pj]C[is this a good response?

no K10 is influence oriented and you play a second low move.
Q10 is better (see variations).];B[ol]TR[oj][ql]MA[km][lm][mm]

Black is now in a better position than you
but his advance is not as big as it seem because he is a bit
overconcentrated.

If you directly invade the danger is not only the life of your group
but the solid walls black will build in exchange of this life.]

(;W[fq]C[this is a bad move i think now. it helps b to even reinforce his moyo on the bottom right

yes this is a big mistake
If black plays solid, white will suffer in this game....];B[hq]

better flee and reduce the moyo];B[ho]C[the moyo is more solid now.]

(;W[bq]TR[fm]LB[oj:A]C[thought i could attack b group, but with c9 nothing is left to attack, so wrong plan for w i think, but what is the right one?

before attacking you must surround your opponent.
delta is better.

But the idea is not good : if you kill the group you must finish sente
otherwise black plays A];B[bp];W[dq];B[cp];W[br];B[ck];W[cj]
;B[bk]TR[oj]C[i think now w should ignore this move and play somerwhere else: but where? maybe somewhere round m8 (to invade this big moyo?)

invading is dangerous but possible.
I would play delta to reduce the moyo.]
(;W[bj];B[ql];W[oj];B[mk];W[md]C[where else to play?

this move is good];B[qh]C[the invasion is ok]
(;W[qf]C[is this the right move to attack b?

depends what you want, black can connect now (see variation)]

(;B[oh]C[black did not connect :)];W[ni];B[nh];W[mi];B[mh]

m12 is dangerous, black may still connect and kill you.];B[oi]

;W[kh];B[lh]C[another thank you move];W[ji]TR[kj]C[maybe l10 would have been stronger?

of course !! this move is a thank you move,
you make a nice present to black: the delta forcing move to reinforce his  (hudge) moyo.]

can he use hist r10 wall to invade the big black moyo at the bottom?

no it is too late black can still invade at delta,
the game is almost already loosed.]
