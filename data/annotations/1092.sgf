C[Hi Zee, Kas.

Your game was typical of beginners playing ... I think both of you have many good tendencies, but you both lack a certain amount of basics, and experience. I hope that my comments will help you. Good luck.

I hope I do not sound harsh with some of my comments.  Also, I tend to waffle on abit.

Anyway, if you have any further questions, please contact me.]
;B[po]C[This move often leads to complicated fights in or around this corner. More usual first moves are the 4-4 point, or either of the 3-4 points.]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[pj];W[jd]LB[ep:a][eq:b][np:c][oq:d]C[White is better off playing at 'a' or 'b' or 'c' or 'd' , breaking up the black formation]
;B[jp]C[Good by black - he now has a so-called 'double-wing formation around the lower right corner. This a strong position]
;W[dj]C[White forms the double wing formation as well. OK.]

(;B[pg]LB[qf:a]C[This is neither here nor there. It does try to expand blacks territory, but on the fourth line, it is more influence aimed than territory aimed.

A better move would be 'a'. Almost all the standard sequences (joseki) will give white territory in the corner, with black influence downwards. (The variations show some typical sequences)]
;W[jg]LB[dn:a][ep:b][np:c][pp:d][qp:e]C[White probably thinks that he is creating a large moyo, and he is. But the moyo has no solid foundations. There are several places where black can play and expect to live.

A better play for white would have been in the lower left ('a' being the simplest). This would also expand his moyo, but also be sente (require a response)
'b' could also be played, although it would mean letting black expand up the left, while white makes a group which can later reduce the black moyo from the left.

Personally, I find large moyos difficult to handle, I would have played 'b'

At this stage of the game, white should also remember that invading at 'c', 'd' or 'e' is perfectly possible, although it is a little bit too early to do so just yet.]
;B[jl]LB[dm:a]C[The same comment applies to this Black move. Plays around 'a' would be much more interesting.]
;W[jj]C[The lower left is still more interesting];B[ll]C[Same comment here]
;W[fm]LB[dm:a]C[Hmm.
Good thinking, wrong execution.   In Go, the basic rules are: First the corners, then the side, and then the centre.

Both B&W took the corners, then extended along the sides, However, you both jumped into the centre too quickly. The moyos you've mapped out are large, but stronger players would have easily reduced them or cut them apart.   Stones on the fourth line do not safely anchor the groups - the only 'solid' stone on the board is B 3 in the lower left.

There are a lot more points to be had along the sides than there are in the middle. White was right in extending here, but it should have been along the edge, on the 4th (or 3rd) line. Back can still play 'a' and he will have gained more than white by the exchange.

Last, but not least, the white stone is only loosely connected to the rest of his stones. It could come under attack later.]
;B[fp]LB[cm:a][cn:b]C[Black is very submissive. If white now plays 'a' or 'b', black will be far behind]
;W[mj]LB[mg:a][ne:b]C[A good move should do several things:
- Create territory/influence
- Defend a weak point
- Attack an enemy group
A really good move does all three of teh above

This move does none of the above.
- White needs to add at least two more stones before this area becomes territory (at e.g. 'a' and 'b')
- Black can still play at 'a' or 'b' to intrude into the white moyo
- None of blacks groups are threatened.];B[cn]C[Good, but too timid.]
;W[ok]LB[pk:a]C[This white does attack black slightly, by threatening to cut apart his stones. However, since black will reply at 'a', all white has done is to force black to play in a place where black would have liked to play anyway. These moves are called thank-you moves and are normally best left for later.]

(;B[pl]C[Ai. This leaves open the door for complications later. See variation.]
;W[hl];B[cl]C[Good.];W[hn];B[hp]C[Notice how white makes very few points in the centre like this, but how black solidifies a large amount of points at the bottom.]
;W[ng];B[cj]LB[ch:a][cf:a]C[Again, this is timid.  It is not a bad move, but there are other moves that would have reduced the upper left white moyo more, e.g. playing at 'a' or 'b']
;W[ci];B[aj]LB[ck:a][bj:b][bk:c][bi:d][ch:e][dk:f][dl:g][ek:h]
[bl:i][cm:j][bh:k]C[This a mistake. There are normally no reason to play stones lower than the third line this early in the game. In particular, this stone will never be able to make any territory. White can even attack it strongly. imagine white 'a', black 'b' etc....]
;W[qf]C[Good. This move expands the corner, and black should respond. Indirectly, it also protects a later black invasion at the 3-3 point in the upper right.]
;B[qg];W[jn];B[kn];W[nm];B[mn];W[ph];B[qi]LB[qh:a]C[Why not just at 'a'?]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[oh];B[ah]LB[oq:a][no:b][qp:c]C[This move does not do a lot. White will respond, and the value of the move will have been very few points.

White wins by 34 points.
Black could have won it until the very end.... :-)

OK.  Some final comments:
Both players allowed eachother to make a large moyo, literally dividing the goban in two halves. This makes it an awkward game, with lots of 'fiddling' on the borderline, without really any points there. Also the moyos were not based on solid groups. In every corner (except for the lower left) a corner invasion was possible until very late in the game. Indeed, black had several opportunities to take at least 30-40 points. (So had white in the lower left)

Even so, the small-looking black territory (lower side and half of the right) is only 19 points smaller than the white central territory, which looks 'huge' (but isn't, really). (Everything being relative. Compared to most matches, both territories are huge)

The stones black lost on the right, not through very cunning ply by white but by a silly error, were worth 7 points of territory - 14 points in total.

So, why am I repeating this? Because I want you to realise that the 'corner-sides-centre' rule is very, very true. In the beginning of the game, both players had several opportunities to extend their territories along the edge. Not only would this have expanded their territory, but it would also have given the moyos a better 'foundation' against later attacks.

Both players ignored opportunities to do so - which is not good.

Almost as bad was the fact that no player took advantage of this fact and tried to break up the opponents moyo into smaller chunks.

Last, both players seemed to consider that 'edge groups are not worth much'. This is really not very good.

So, what are the main things to be learned from this game?
1. Try to break up your opponents moyo while you can.
2. Always expand along the edges before you stretch into the center.  3. Try to make moves which serve more than one purpose
4. Do not make unnecessary moves])
