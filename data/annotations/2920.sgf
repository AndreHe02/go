AB[pd][dp][pp]C[lately I've played a lot of games where I won by killing a sizeable group but in this case the kill was way too small.

I spent a lot of time hammering jelly, by which I mean trying to contain escaping groups...inevitably at the cost of keeping my own groups connected.  I think in part this is due to too much direct contact play.  after a point I felt like I should back off and try to make territory but I couldn't figure out how to do this without white aggressively pushing through my position.  Also I create weak groups which white harrasses in order to escape.

my play is exactly opposite to the standard opinion on how to play handicap games...I should have played more thickly, made white make the overplays.

all advice welcome, especially any on how better to contain invasions.

thanks...the AcidCasual


Reviewer`s Comments:  

I am a 7k on kgs and go by the handle Ixiah on most of the servers.   

A couple of important points to remember about attacking:

A big group is very hard to kill so you want to just chase it while making profit.  Beware chasing it into your own moyo though ^_^.  Sometimes the opponent will invade a area where a kill is necessary.  Fence the opponent in while trying to avoid contact (which makes him stronger) and then look for a killing shapeto form in his eyespace.  

It is a bit hard to point out mistakes and not sound negative.  Please understand that is not my intent.  I hope my review is helpful!

It allows white to play j 17 in sente which seems to let the group live.  I tried serveral lines and the best I could get was seki for black.   Since the triangle group has two ways of connecting---you really only have to worry abou the square group as far as life goes.  So g 18 rather then g 17 is superior.]

C[Final Comments:

AC---You seem to have the same problems I had not too many months ago.   Here are a few suggestions:

1.  Playing too close to your opponenet when you attack.
2.  Making the killing placement a bit to early.....before a killing shape (bulky 5, the plus shaped 5, rabbity 6, square 4, etc.
3.  Practice on tsumego as much as possible---especially common shapes found in the corners!!  
4.  Remember that the knight move is the main weapon for attack. 

Good luck in your games.
