;W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[dj];W[jp];B[qq]C[g4: Letting white get a wall seems to be too early.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr]
;W[nq];B[cn]C[g4: Becaus of the white wall I would prefer a high approach.]
;W[en]C[This is the first non-standard move.  How should black respond?
g4: This is a good move in itsself. Becaus of this I would have preferred a high approach move. If you are confident with reducing large frameworks, you can invade this corner too. Reducing seems not an easy way. Perhaps H5 now.]
(;B[fq]C[Overplay?  It seems like many of my subsequent problems in the game can be traced back to this.]
;W[hq];B[dr]C[g4: Black loses the possibility to invade the corner and this small group will become heavy and remains unsecure. I would prefer F5, threatening the cut at E5.]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[cm]C[g4: too small];B[bq]C[g4: Very good];W[bp]
;B[dq]C[g4: Just A3 is enough, leaving C5 for a peep. But that doesn't matter much.]

(;B[bl]C[g4: In most cases it is better to connect at D8. The threat is the same. But black gets sente or a very thick position.]

;W[bn]
(;B[fl];W[ek]
(;B[dk];W[ej]
(;B[di]C[g4: This is very cautious. If white connects to D12, this will look too good for him. So E11 is the only way, eventuelly permitting G9]
;W[ei];B[ch];W[cg]
(;B[bj]C[g4: There was a chance. E12 instead seems to win. But you must be able to read it out.]
;W[bh];B[ci];W[eg]C[Had to give a think on how to live here.
g4: Even if black lives here, this is a desaster. The white wall is unbeatable now.]
;B[ai];W[jj]C[This is where I start to feel the game slipping away.  I've got heavy stones that I can't afford to sacrifice and that are surrounded by enemy stones.
g4: This is indeed a difficult situation. But you must be willing to sacrifice these stones.]
;B[fn];W[ep];B[ho]C[g4: Play away from strength. This is not necessarily a threat. White can ignore this Perhaps forcing with F12 and then G10.]
;W[ir];B[hp]C[g4: This move just hepls white. Just connecting at G2 is OK.]
;W[iq]

;W[im];B[il]C[g4: First L10. Then this good move.];W[hm];B[hl]
;W[gm];B[gl]C[g4: Not necessary. Doesn't make more than one eye. Better to expand eye space with M10 and K7.]
;W[jm];B[kj];W[ji];B[km];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[jl]C[g4: Doesn't help much. Better to escape to M11.]

;W[ed];B[df];W[dg];B[dc];W[ec]
(;B[ef]C[g4: Fighting spirit. But black may also play the calm move of L13.]
;W[ff];B[cf]C[g4: Don't let white connect here. F15 is necessary.]
;W[bf]C[Frustratingly sente against the group below.]
(;B[ak]C[g4: This saves 9 black stones and 2 points of territoy, but loses 5 stones and the corner. Better to give them away. See varaiation.]
;W[bc]C[g4: This loss is too big. Black invested 4 moves here and gained less than nothing.]
