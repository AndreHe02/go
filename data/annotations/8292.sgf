C[Hi, I played as white and my friend played as black, his rank is still not determined on kgs so 7k is not necessarily accurate.

I will make some comments on my moves through out the game although my friend has not done so.

Please could you review for black and white.

Thanks];B[pq];W[dc];B[pc];W[eo]C[Just trying a different starting move

oddalot: Trying something new is fine, although this move seems kind of out there.]
;B[cq];W[jc]C[oddalot: It's probably better to either a) enclose a corner b) prevent your opponent from enclosing a corner 
then extending from the side of a 3-4 stone.];B[gc];W[de];B[cj]
;W[qj]C[oddalot: This seems OK considering....C13 might be a better move, but I'm not sure]
;B[qn];W[jq]C[oddalot: Playing R10 and then playing K3 seems kind of slack, next black can enclose the upper right
corner and attack the R10 stone simultaneously. R13 might of been a better move?]
;B[ge]
(;W[eq]C[oddalot: Although this makes good shape and puts some pressure on the C3 stone, the K17 stone is probably in more need of attention. Plus the C3 is on the 3-3 point, so it's probably not to worried about getting attacked.]
;B[co];W[mc];B[qf];W[oj];B[cg]
(;W[jj]C[I am not happy with this move and feel I should have strenghten my top left corner

oddalot: Yes, the top left is most definitely the most important play now. Not only because it strengthens your own group, but because the
G15 group will become weaker if your D17 group gets stronger.

This move (K10) Lacks direction as well....It's not to say that it doesn't have any benefits, it just is a very vague move.
Why not play moves that have many benefits and are clearer to a strategy you might have?]
;B[ib];W[je];B[gg];W[mq]C[oddalot: Still time to do something about the top left]
;B[bc]C[oddalot: This move by black might not be the best way to attack....you may be able to counter attack.

Now you need to think: 1) Can I make this group live? 2) By living, can I gain influence or territory 3) Can I counter attack my opponent as well to live and 4) If all else fails, can I sacrifice to get some compensation for a capture?

Those are important things to consider when your group has no eyes and is trying to live.]
;W[cf];B[eg];W[bg];B[ch];W[fh]C[oddalot: This peep really serves no purpose at the moment. In fact, if black replies at F13 it will make his group
surrounding your half alive E17 group stronger. This is probably the worst possible thing to happen, keep this in mind.
Never play moves that strengthen your opponent if you can help it, even if they seem like good moves, always keep the
priorities of your current situation in mind.];B[cb];W[fg];B[eb]
;W[ef];B[id];W[dm]C[oddalot: This seems like a pretty good move, his C12 group is now under pressure and you will be able to
gain much from this, if not kill it out right. Of course you should usually never try to actually kill a group unless
it is very easy or they continue to ignore your moves. Just try and get influence or territory from the attack.]

;B[hl];W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[pk];W[pj];B[qk];W[on]C[I am not happy with my overall board position here

oddalot: Your position is actually very good here considering, black really doesn't have many points at all.
You on the other hand have a good position on the bottom, and P6 is a decent move.
Blacks only real territory is the top right, and it probably won't amount to much because your white stones are facing
it on both sides.

Black has two really weak groups now....C12 and H8. You should focus your attention on attacking these will solidifying your territory on the
bottom and bottom-middle.];B[om]
(;W[pm]C[oddalot: hmmm don't think this works, O7 seems like the natural move here, seems more sente, and
has the huge effect of making good shape for the N3 area];B[ol]
;W[qo]C[oddalot: This is good too, now black is under some pressure.]
;B[qm];W[rq];B[nq];W[mp];B[ll];W[jn]C[I feel now a move to help my three stones on line 10 would have been better

oddalot: Yes, your last 5 moves or so weakened your Q10 group significantly, even though
it made good solid territory in the corner. Always keep that in mind when you are playing, of course
you can't keep every group healthy, you have to compromise....but just try and compromise in your favor.

Not only that, but now it's going to be harder to attack the H8 stone.]
;B[me];W[jd];B[lg];W[jg];B[lj];W[qg];B[pf];W[pg];B[dp];W[ob]
C[oddalot:

I would probably use this opportunity to make sure that the Q10 group is absolutely alive.
At this point in the game, if it dies black will win the game. And if it lives, white will almost certainly win.]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[md];W[jb];B[ie];W[gp]C[Bad

oddalot: Bad, but not the worst, still time to attack C12 and H8]

;W[iq];B[og];W[of]C[oddalot: Hmmm....I don't know if this cut and sacrifice starting with this move is really worth it.
It is quite clever and well played out, that is good on your part, although just making this group live by itself
is probably better.];B[oh];W[rf];B[rg];W[qe];B[pe];W[pd];B[oe]

that you can't afford to let this happen. This is not good at all....this is a losing move.]
