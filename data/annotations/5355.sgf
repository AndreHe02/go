C[Hi! here is a game played since a few.
I don't succed to review alone. If anyone can help me, thanks to him.

H : hi, my comments will start by this 'H'.];B[dd];W[pp];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[nq];W[or]LB[qn:B][jp:A][qp:C]C[I think it's not a really good move, but i don't really know how to answer to it. What i play seems to be correct, not other variations.

H : this move is a mistake, it gives white too much territory in the corner.
Black can play A, B or C (see variations)]
(;B[oq];W[pq];B[nr];W[pr];B[kp]LB[dp:A]C[H : this is bad for black. White has too much territory, and black's stones arae facing A.]
;W[qf]C[H : good direction.];B[pf]C[H : not a good move in my opinion, even though it is "joseki". see later why.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]
(;W[qi]
(;B[mc]LB[nd:A]C[H : usual move is at A, espacially now that you have a stone in the upper left star point, you should play high and aim at a low extension in the middle.]
;W[cf]LB[iq:A]C[H : Right now I feel that A is a good point to take. Black is not yet alive there, so it may be intersting to attack, given the support of the lower left star point. Black could live immediately, of course, but by doing so he may  reinforce white.]
;B[ch];W[fc]
(;B[fd]C[H : by attaching, you are reinforcing a white stone that is inside your influence area. This is bad I think. see variation]
;W[cc];B[ec]LB[dc:C][cd:D][fd:B][ch:A]C[H : weird move. What did you want to do?
If you wanted to cut to emphasize on the upper side, you should not have played A in the first place, but B directly. Now you could play C.
You can also play D and look to the left side.];W[gc]LB[cc:A]
[fc:C][cf:B]C[H : That move threatends to link A to B or C. It also threantes to make some kind of a base on the upper side with an extension. It looks ok.]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[dg]LB[bc:B][ed:A][ee:C]C[H : now black has a bad result. If he wanted the left side, he should have sticked to a normal sequence. No A is a weak point and white has a kikashi at C, and white also has B. This looks like trouble for black.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[ed];B[de];W[fe]C[H : Now look at the result : Whte has the corner and influence that annihilates the strong black group on upper right. Black's groups has a lot of stones for only a few points, especially if white plays B17 later, and black's influence towards the left side has a lesser value since there is the white lower-left hoshi.]
;B[qm]
(;W[gd]LB[cn:B][ro:A][fq:C]TR[qm]SQ[pp][pq][or][pr]C[A shisho breaker, i'm playing it to force the oponent to kill F16 and have a advantage for disturb this positions

H : If white plays A, he lives easily and now your stone is in trouble with no base and between two strong white groups.
B or C were more important.
White should not answer this ladder breaker but play at A instead. What do you care about these three white stones anyway? There not cutting any weak black group. They're worth 6 points. You can consider taking sente and playing A, B or C equivalent to 20 points.]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[pk]LB[qo:A]C[H : white helps you to play at A, so play at A. You will be more solid.]
;W[rk];B[rl]LB[nn:A]C[probably not the better answerbut i don't see other.

H : You don't see other possible answers because you forgot about getting out in the center. For example, A links up withe the lower group, it's a safe move.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[nn]LB[on:A][oo:B]C[H : I find A is better. Black B would be a problem.]
;B[pj]LB[pl:A]C[H : black may have a problem with the A cut.]
;W[pi];B[nl];W[lm]C[H : I don't see the point in this move. A play to extend D4 is important now.]
;B[fp]LB[fq:A]C[H : I like A better.];W[fq]C[H : very big move.]
;B[gq];W[eq];B[gp];W[ip]LB[cm:A]C[H : No need to go there... you can play calmly at A.]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[jq];W[hp];B[fm]LB[hq:A][gr:B]C[H : you should protect the cut at A. You can play B if you like.]
;W[hq]C[H : there is a cut, but it is too soon, white's group is kinda weak now.]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[fr];W[ir];B[gs];W[kq];B[jr]
(;W[lq];B[lp];W[in];B[mq];W[dm]LB[cm:A][cn:B]C[H : too high. play at A or B]
;B[cn];W[dn];B[cm];W[cl]LB[co:A]C[H : maybe calmly play at A is better.]
;B[bl];W[bk];B[ck]TR[bk]C[an error.

H : not really. See variation.];W[dl];B[bj]
(;W[dk];B[cj];W[co]
(;B[bn];W[bo];B[an];W[ao];B[ak]C[H : white ends in sente anyway.]
;W[fk]LB[bc:D][kc:A][rd:B][qo:C]C[H : useless move. A to D look worth a lot more.]
;B[gl]C[H : where do the players go? The center looks interesting... but there are no point to get here...]

;B[if];W[ig];B[hg]TR[hf]C[he can cut here, bad for black

H : no problem, black is strong on the left.];W[hf]
(;B[gf]C[H : this is bad, it strengthens white. see variation for an example of attack.]
;W[he];B[je]LB[jf:A]C[H : When white plays A, black loses liberties. You see why the last black move was bad, now.]

H : see variation.]

H: yeah.. ^_^];B[fa]C[H : one more sacrificed stone? ;-)];W[fb]
;B[ff]LB[bc:A]C[H : worth zero point gote. something like that. White should answer at A, which is big and safe.]
;W[jd]C[H : not necessary. white does not count liberties, and black gets a free move.]
;B[md]LB[cb:A][re:C][dr:B]C[H : there are bigger moves on the board. A to C for example.]

[ei][fi]C[H : this move is really showing the approach of yose of black (and of white, too) : it tries to protec (which it does not) the square points, while the triangle stones are now in bad shape. That would be a good exchange for white indeed !
Simply lpay at A to defend.];W[gk];B[gj];W[hk];B[er]LB[dr:A]
[cs:B]C[H : big move. Black can lpay further (A or B)];W[dr]

[ir][kr][lr][mr][fs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms]C[H  : overall commentary :

You should try to assess what is important, in termes of points. capturing three stones in the beginning of a game is useless, unless these are important cutting stones. But pointwise, it's nothing.
This also goes for yose ( a game can be won in yose, often...)

I hope the comments have been helpful.])
