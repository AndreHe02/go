C[Sup: I'm Suphyph and will prefix my comments with "Sup". This was a teaching game played face to face with a friend. I played white. I've put in some of my own comments, questions and variations. Any additional comments, variations, or tips for either player will be welcome. I'm especially interested in the opening. Thank you!

Hi, Im Claudio, I will answere as better i can; my comments will be mark as Cla]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[nc]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[Sup: Any comment on the difference between A and B for black here?

Cla: The difference is centred in balance; A is more balanced with your low right  corner]
;B[pf]LB[pb:B][kc:A]C[Sup: I guess B first would have been better.

Cla: Depends on what do you want; B as agressive play can also get an agressive response, see the variation]
(;W[kc];B[fq]C[Cla: Balance, I think is better in E4. Looks better with your lower right corner]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ip]C[Sup: This is long and makes the bottom open to invasion, but could setup a nice moyo if b plays in the bottom first.]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[qm];B[ci];W[cg];B[cl];W[kq]C[Cla: I can tell that our game styles are oppositte, however this look as a desperate invation, may me you could do more around F16]
;B[mq];W[iq];B[hq];W[hp]C[Cla: Except in handicap games, when you are the invasor is better leave a weak base and find air by jumps]
(;B[gp];W[ho];B[jp];W[jq];B[jn];W[hr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr];W[lr]
C[Sup: When I started the invasion, I was really looking to end in sente so I could play first in the top, but I felt this move was necessary. Still, settling in gote isn't a bad result for white, right?

Cla: Is a very good result for you, but not for get a stable invation group, is because Black is really in gote; see the variation]
;B[fc]
(;W[hc];B[cc]C[Sup: It seems something has gone wrong here for black. What would have been a better way to invade the top?

Cla: If he wants the corner, should play directly for it, this kind of aji are more appropied for handicap games]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[pb]C[Cla: Here is where the black invation goes wrogn, B14-B13, C14-D14, is a sente secuence for black that offers a cut in D13 for the future.]
;W[ne]C[Sup: White is starting a large moyo. Black should be looking for the right moment to reduce it.

Cla: Right, but first needs a evaluation of the potencial score and know better how much violence is required]
;B[fn];W[em];B[fm]C[Sup: Black gets more comfortable along the bottom, but the influence is not pointing anywhere significant, and the b group on the left comes under pressure.]
;W[di];B[dj];W[ei]
(;B[lo]C[Sup: Seems slow. I was afraid black would playing something in the middle to reduce the white moyo, so this seemed like a relief. The black group on the left side is quite vulnerable. Perhaps an attack against bottom left white group could help out.

Cla: Right perspective, maybe black is covering his weakness to attack hard later]
;W[mh]C[Cla: Huge move, now is the moment for black to strike around J12]
;B[pm];W[qn];B[pn];W[ro];B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[mk];B[jk];W[ji]
;B[hj];W[hh]C[Sup: The completion of white's large moyo seems to be the end of the game, unless there's some attack or invasion I'm missing.]
(;B[ql];W[rl];B[pk]C[Sup: Bad shape for black? It just allows white to settle.

Cla: Yes, the only two explanations that i can see are: 1. Missclick or place, 2. Is hoping for a secuence of sente moves later]
