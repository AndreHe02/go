;W[dc];B[fq]LB[de:A]C[here or A?

Either is fine, it depends on your strategy.  If you like 
fighting more, A would be preferred, but for big moyo 
games, black 5 is usualy played.];W[hq]C[Here, I think a tight pincer is too severe.  In some cases, it 
could work, but here it puts white at a disadvantage if 
black plays according to the variation.  
I would prefer a move at A, or maybe B. (A works better 
with the marked stones.)];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bq]C[Was this a good move?

It was a fine move; I'm surprised white played at B4 
instead of G5 though :)];W[bp];B[fp];W[fo]LB[hp:A]C[Who did this result favour?
This is fairly even for both sides, but I think black is a little 
better off because white's wall is so far from his single 
stone at D16 and black can later attack with A.]
(;B[cf]LB[de:A]C[A?

I think black 15 is right. Were black to play at A, though it 
is good...

This way, black limits the amount of territory white can 
build on the left side by a little andallows for black to make 
sabaki, either on the side or in the corner, more easily, as 
in the game];W[ci];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B[cg];W[eh]LB[eg:A]
[jc:B][hc:C][pj:D][nc:E]C[Is it too early to play A?

It's very tempting since it would split white's group into 
two.  However, I might play around B first then play at A.
This is because if white plays somewhere around C to 
prevent the cut at A from being so effective, black 
creates a extremely large moyo with D or a lot of territory 
with E];B[pk];W[nc]
(;B[lc]LB[pf:A]C[I think perhaps this move should be at A since it seems to 
create a more "pure and simple" game for black

But in no way is this a bad move; it's very good; just I 
prefer to start large scale fights becasue I tend to make 
one mistake and totally get crushed :(

(I'm kind of digressing here, but I bought this really good 
book by Takao Shinji called "Pure and Simple:  Takao's 
Astute Use of Brute Force".  Though it is a little 
advanced, it helped a LOT with my style.  You might like 
it.)];W[ne];B[pf];W[jc];B[ng];W[le];B[pb]C[Was it a good plan sacrificing the stone?

Yes, it was very smart!  Especially since this move 
threatens to connect to your lone stone.];W[mf];B[mg]C[Good move!  Many people would be tempted to play a 
more loose move, but this move is very good, probably 
honte.];W[lg]
(;B[eg]C[Now is it the right timing?

I think it's a good move to play.  It just seems hard to 
decide between this and building a moyo at the bottom 
first, like in the variation, which I would have been 
tempted to play.];W[dh];B[ef];W[fe];B[ee]LB[db:A]C[Was this unnecessary?

No, white would definitely respond, so it's not horrible, it 
just feels aji keshi to me since white's group gets stronger 
at the expense on just one point.  Perhaps A instead (for a 
local play, black would keep sente and you could still 
play this move later)?];W[fd];B[nb]TR[kd]C[How big is this move?

It's VERY big since black is connected and because of 
the weakness it leaves for white at the marked spot; if 
white doesn't block before you decide to cut, black could 
cut and do a good bit of damage.

Also the stones are more awkward now.];W[oc];B[ob];W[pc];B[qc]

(;B[np]C[Was this attack good enough?

Defintely, had you attacked from elsewhere, white could 
play one of these variations.];W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[ol];W[om]

Theoretically, no, but with his ocassional weird plays, 
sometimes I wonder:)];B[qn];W[rn];B[rp];W[so];B[kq]C[W got sealed in.Was Black favoured here?

YES!!! I wish I knew what white was thinking when he let 
black seal him in!  This definitely cost him the game.];W[kc]

(;B[go]LB[fl:A][dl:B]C[Was this an overplay?

I think the only reason it is an overplay now is because it's 
too early to play comfortably.  First, I would play around A 
since white would be forced to play around B prevent his 
stones from being attacked there.];W[gp];B[eq];W[ho];B[gn];W[hn]

your comment, so I'm positive you saw the right move

Thanks for letting me review your game!
Your thoughts were very insightful and on occasions, you 
played moves that I missed (perhaps I shouldn't be saying 
this though :)

I think the only thing you need to work on is playing 
through several tsumegos a day if you have time.  When 
your opponent responded normally, you played very well.  
It seemed that when he played hamete, it flustered you 
and you fell for his tricks.
