AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

for a long time now I'm swaying to and fro from 14k to 12k. I feel hanging around without coming forward.
So I ask for your advice to get new aspects of developing my playing go.

This ist the kifu of a game, played during the tournament Bambus at Basel, Switzerland, on 2010-05-16.
I played Black as a 12k against White 8k with a handicap of 4 stones, 60 min. time, from which I needed about 50 min..

Hi,

My name is John (FL, USA) and I'm around 5k.  My comments will appear after "JFR:"

Remember that I am 5k and I do not see everything.  I will try to concentrate on concepts and go theory.

My main comment would be to put more pressure on white.  In your game your stones would become over-concentrated and white would be able to make dual purpose moves that connected areas more efficiently than yours.

Let me know if you have any questions and keep playing!

Best Wishes, John  

I didn't comment on everything but tried to touch on main points over minor ones.]

(;B[np];W[rp];B[qq]TR[ck][qk][cl][ql][iq][jq][kq][lq]C[i'm not happy about this consecution - to symmetric, I think

JFR:  There are a few things going on.  W is making some overplays by not making shape (at the square marks).   Bottom is open for an invasion.  This is a case where you will have to play an extra stone to close off an area.  

Since you have the handi stones you are in a better place, but this sort of play is not good in even games.]

(;B[fc];W[bd];B[cc];W[dj]TR[ch][dh][cl][dl]C[JFR:  This looks good for w (it is too nice to let w connect the whole left side) but b can put pressure on the right side 

When you are playing handi do not fear of white's strength

esp in the start of game: put pressure on w

Also, at the end of game w had a huge left side.  Be aware of weak points and don't wait too long to probe, push and take sente to strengthen b and rein w in]

(;B[fq]SQ[dp][pp]C[JFR:  Because you started out with 4 stones (4-4 star hoshi points which already concentrate on influence) I would play the mirror knights move which alternates 3rd and 4th line play.  You move was playable but I believe it to be more advanced and risky.  I would try this type of play (if you are going to mirror and not pincer) to advance.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq];W[ck]C[JFR:  b is good])
(;B[cl]C[JFR:  Extension and pincer.  W has no base yet.  This can be very good for b]
))
(;B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[ck];B[ci];W[ek]C[JFR:  This sequence puts a lot of pressure on w.

Applying the right amount of pressure early on is important in handi games because that is when you have the advantage.  

In this case, with 4 stones, you can squeeze white and make w live small and strengthen around.]
