C[DB: Hi, I will mark my comments with DB.  Reviewing white, but if something stands out for black, I will comment on that as well. In this game, it seemed important to point out better black moves, since white made overplays that should be pointed out.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qe];B[oe];W[pc]C[DB:  Nice and steady.  Black's P15 is very unusual and probably a poor choice here.  White has gained a large corner, black has a stone which may serve to reduce a white framework.  However, there is no framework to reduce yet!]
;B[pd];W[qd];B[qc]C[DB:  Black is trying too hard I think.]

(;W[pe]C[DB: Corner is bigger, see variation.];B[od];W[qb];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[sc]C[DB: no good for black.];W[pb];B[pf]
(;W[rd];B[qf];W[sd];B[rf]LB[rd:A]TR[mc]C[DB:

White does not need to respond to S14.  Black has 1 liberty, White 2.

Always ask yourself the following 3 questions before choosing a move:

1.  Are any of my groups in danger?
2.  Are any of black's groups weak or in danger?
3.  Where are the biggest areas?

On this board:  Question 1.  White has one group to consider, the upper right.  It is alive as it stands, but could be surrounded by black in one move.  White's previous move at A was very unfortunate, allowing for black to get walls on both the side and top.  If black is allowed to play P17, white's group will have no future for development.  So this a move to help this group is urgent.  


N17 seems like the best move to prevent the white group from being sealed off.]

(;W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[dn]C[DB: black is handed beautiful thickness and the corner at the same time.

[en:B][pp:C]C[DB: Black has much more from this sequence.

2 areas of thickness (B and A).  Each face the corner stone C.  This is ideal for black.  An invasion by white will be allow for profit on one side (near A) or the other (B).  In contrast, white is very thin and does not have the same kind of thickness on his part of the board.]
