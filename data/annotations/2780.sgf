C[This is a very interesting game between two over-agressive player. Because they like fighting, I've point out main mistakes in those fights and include some variation. But I could not keep track of all variation in those fight, so please explore yourself a little more.
But as always, the game was not won or lost in those fights. Both player made very costly mistakes of direction.

To progress just follow those two rules :
1. Don't save stones of no value. (A stone of value is a stone who cut apart a weak group, a stone who cut two strong groups is of no value)
2. Be less agressive, especially with extension. Over extension are costly. You think you gain time, but soon, you have to add a move to ptotect all the thing, so you loose time instead.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[po];B[pk]C[Because K4 stones give black momentum, a very severe pincer at Q7 is best.But this pincer is correct.]
;W[oq];B[pp]C[This move is bad. It's a good shape to remenber : never bump like that on the white stone in this shape. The correct move is P2 not to help white making shape.]
;W[op]C[Two stones against two stones, the player who make first the hane take the lead so white is very happy of this shape.]
;B[qo]C[Black is forced to submit here so he is defeated. White has dealt with black moyo with ease.]
;W[oo]C[Q6 would have been better further humilaiting black into submission. Now white shape looks heavy in my eyes.]
;B[qn];W[kq]C[White is in no immediate danger. To leave so small cannot be good. If white want to devellop his stones, he must go for the center. M5 for example. Later white would like to invade at H3.]
;B[jq]C[Good shape];W[kp]C[Same bad shape as before. But this time white make it ! Usual moves are either K2 or L2.]
;B[ko]C[Black is happy.];W[lo];B[ln]C[Black is VERY happy.]
;W[jr]C[Oh !]
(;B[jo]C[Slack move. Black has nothing to fear. See var. Hane is best (J2). M4 is good enough.]
;W[ir]C[White lives with territory and black stones have many weak points (L6-H4)]
;B[cl];W[cm]C[This move is always a bad idea. Black will extend becoming very strong. At best, white will live small in the corner. 
D4-D6 stones are no good to enclose the corner easily. The power of those stones is to attack. So white should pincer at C11 or D11.]
;B[dl];W[eq]C[This move is submissive.];B[fp]C[Nooooooo. White has just made a very submissive move. Play elswere : C8-D8 formation is praying for an extension. If not they could be pincered and suffer. F3 stone has no value. You just make two haevy stones with a weak point at H4.]
;W[hp]C[D11 is far bigger.];B[cf]C[Better late than never. This is the good direction of play but ...
Why not B12 instead. This extension is too far away and will lead to problems.]
;W[gn]C[Too small. This move is just big yose.
An invasion (at D11) would have left black with tons af weak groups everywhere.]
;B[hq]C[Stupid. And this area is small. C17, F17 or F16 are far bigger.]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[ho];B[lp]
(;W[lq]C[Good, the danger is real.];B[mo]
(;W[mq]C[This move is not necessary, see var.];B[fc]C[At last !]
;W[df]C[Its painfull to push black in the direction he want to go. I prefer D15 or F16.]
;B[de]C[Oh ! This move is rarely good. It involve a lot of shishos.  Even if the shishos are in black favour  (like here)white can play safely at E15]

(;W[fd]C[No, the shape is too unstable to play leaning moves.]

(;B[gd]C[NO. Black  must take what is given.]
(;W[ec]C[Bad timing.];B[fe];W[ed];B[gc]C[E15 is better. F17 stone is of little value.]
;W[ce]C[Blunder. D15 giving access to the center is good enough.]
;B[ee];W[cg]
(;B[bf]C[I cannot read this sort of line easily. But I thionk it's an overplay. D16 captute white with ease.]
;W[bg]C[Does not protect the weak point at C16.];B[cd]C[At last.]
;W[be];B[eb];W[ef];B[di]C[There is no territory here. Go to the center (G8 or G9). You will think of attacking white later because it's not very feasible.]
;W[em];B[co];W[cn];B[ff];W[eh];B[fk];W[fg];B[gg]C[Flee, flee, flee ! H9 is necessary.]
;W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[hk]C[Bingo !];B[fi];W[fh];B[bi]
(;W[ej]C[Not urgent. This move helps black to make sabaki. You have to learn to torture slowly this kind of group. see var. I'm not sure if black can live or not. I think not.]
;B[dj];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[dk];W[ei];B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bk]
;B[bj];W[am];B[ak]C[Black score a little success in leaving (thanck to the sabaki sequence initiated by F10). But white is globally happy because is has make power in the center and now L5 big group becomes a target instead of a force.]
;W[pi]C[What about a direct assault at N7 ?];B[ep]C[Does not work.]
;W[dq];B[fm];W[gl];B[en];W[dm];B[do]
(;W[bo]C[No. Never push black in the direction he WANT to go. Just F6 and it's over.]
;B[cp]
(;W[bq]C[Thin shape. C3 is better.];B[cq];W[cr]
(;B[dr]C[NOOOOOOOO ! Save you trump card for the final assault !]

C[sloyautaf [5k\]: :o)
The rusult is normal after all. But white had hard time to collect what was his.]
;B[pg]C[Good.But J10 is very attractive.];W[nl]C[Good direction. But a leaning attack at P9, followed by the shape tesuji at N7 is sharper.]
;B[jl]C[Slow. L9 is faster.];W[jh]C[sloyautaf [5k\]: well played]
;B[kf]C[No. You moyo is NOT yet territory. You protect wind whand you risk life. O7 is an idea to see white reaction. K10 is a good point. So is N9.]
;W[kk]C[Outch.];B[kl];W[lk];B[nn];W[pm];B[ll];W[mm]C[No ! Trying to kill is a bad idea. Just Q8 is very strong.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[nm];W[qm]C[Q8 is better shape.];B[nk];W[ol];B[ok]
;W[pn];B[pr];W[in]C[Save that for yose.];B[mp];W[rm];B[nh];W[rp]
;B[qp];W[ro];B[rq];W[rn];B[qr];W[qj]C[Slow. O17 or P18 is urgent.]
;B[ih]C[P17 and all black moyo becomes territory.];W[ni];B[mi]
;W[nj];B[mh];W[oh];B[og];W[qc]C[At last ! But black lead is clear if he blocks at Q17. So you must play more risky at P18 or even more risky at O17. Black would have no safe move to keep his lead and the lmast fight would heve been decisive.]
