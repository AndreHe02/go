C[jaimea [11k\]: Hi
jsparks [12k\]: hi
jsparks [12k\]: have fun];B[pd]C[jaimea [11k\]: you too];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[dj];W[jq]LB[po:B][qo:A]C[I think approaching the corner at A or B is bigger]
;B[cf];W[cl]LB[fd:B][ch:C][jq:A]C[J: I don't like this move

This is bad because it leaves the white stone at the top lonely.  The stone at the bottom has A in the vicinity as backup already.  Playing at B would have been much better (more in line with the direction of play) and black can get a good result by playing there himself now.  (note how with a white stone at B aims at the invasion at C)]
;B[fq]LB[dq:A]C[Black should stabalize his left side group before invading your framework at the bottom (A is a better point for an invasion in my opinion).]
;W[dq];B[fo];W[mq];B[ip];W[qo]LB[io:B][jp:A]C[Bad to ignore the shoulder hit, white whould first exchange A for B and then approach the corner.  If black later gets the chance to play A then the balance of power in the center bottom tips towards his own group.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[mo];W[pk]LB[no:A][rq:B]C[Reinforcing the bottom is better, the cut at A would be thick for white right now.  Locally diving to B threatens blacks corner stones more.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[qp];W[qf];B[md];W[gc];B[cc]LB[ef:C][ck:A][dl:B]
C[This gives white an excellent opprotunity to build a wall facing down the left side and devestate black's position there (losing the corner is no big thing, black will live small, hopefully in gote and with the influence that you build many good moves with which to use sente).

If i were black I'd stabalize my side group with the sequence from black A, white B, black C]
;W[cd]LB[dg:A][ch:B][di:C]C[J: too greedy, I fear. I was planning a future invasion at C12 or D12

For reference the point at D12 is a bad move, the points useful to invasion and reduction are A, B and C, you can confirm this for yourself by laying out an extension and trying some variations.]
;B[dc];W[ec]LB[ed:B][cf:A]C[This is an overplay, with the stone at A white cannot hane and must play B, from here there is not much that can go well for white in the corner.]

;B[fc];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[he]LB[md:B][cn:A]C[J: I think I lost a lot in this transaction

Yes, black started out weak and now has beautiful thick positions on both sides.  With his strength on the left side he can think about an invasion at A and his dubious move at B now sits on the perfect point relating to his thickness on the top left.]
;W[rd]LB[pc:B][qc:A][qd:C]C[An invasion at A would be good since black has difficulty deciding which side to block.  If at B you can connect to your stone on the right (compared to your slide white's result is much better) but if black blocks at C then he chases white into his large territory at the top.]

;B[fn];W[am];B[dn]C[Only six point, in gote at that, this is a severe blunder on black's part, as good as a move in hand for white.]
;W[of];B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[nh]LB[ni:A]C[A would be more severe]

C[simply capturin at A is best.  If black B, White C is tricky, black captures two stones then white cuts off two stones at D.

If black plays at D then white is happy to have forced black into bad shape and connects his two stones at E.  With his bad shape black will have a hard time fighting the capturing race on the left.]
;W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[pf];W[qd];B[pc];W[rh];B[ri]C[There is no way for white to live here. the cut at A is still the biggest local point.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[re];W[qe];B[rf];W[sc]LB[se:A]C[A is the vital point for both.]

;B[si]LB[ph:B][oi:A]C[The cut at A, still huge, is now sente for white because it threatens B]
