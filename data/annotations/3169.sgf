C[Please review for black. Thank you in advance for your time !

The bad news was that the game looked somewhat uncomfortable for black in the beginning, mostly because of inefficiency in black's position. The good news is that black fought through white's moyo (and did not try to make territory out of thickness), almost pulling out a win. I think that you will get much better if you set yourself up better in fuseki. I have commented on parts of the game i thought were most important, but if you have any other questions, please feel free to ask. 

My ideas are not necessarily correct, but hopefully they will make you think about critical points of the game.

;B[dn];W[co];B[bh]C[On second thought, this looked like a mistake. Am I right ?

This is too slow right now. it is only points];W[dc]LB[fc:B]
[gc:A]C[Be careful what direction you play here. Consider your left-side wall. You don't want to duplicate its effect on the center. My idea at A or B is to work well on the side with q16. if white tries to split, you can force him to play dame while you build up a wall facing q16 on the top side, which is more valuable than a wall in the middle. There is probably a more efficient and shapely answer, but I'm not that strong yet.]

C[both walls can be easily negated by a play around tengen, while also expanding white's moyo.]
;B[cd]C[this is probably too small right now.];W[qf]C[exchanging black c16 for white r14 is better for white, i think, because white has prospects for big moyo while black is grabbing a point or two.]

;W[oq];B[qp];W[po];B[rn];W[np]C[I think that r12 is a better point since you don't let white have influence in the center. Use thickness to attack! This is the thinnest part of white's moyo, and you have to put your thickness to good use. r12 might be a game-winning move, better than just points in the corner.]

;B[rf];W[oc]C[p17 is not sente, i think you should attack some of the weak spots of white's shape. Maybe around n5]

[as][bs][cs][ds][es]C[At this point of the game, I had no idea where to play. I realize this wasn't a good idea.

If you don't know where to play, you need to count first. Squares and circles mark certain territory. It looks like black and white are about even, so you don't have to do something crazy.

The list of priorities:

0. Settle stones
1. Create territory out of white's possible territory
2. Expand moyo while cutting down white's moyo.
3. Reduce without gaining more points.

#2 may have greatest priority in a moyo game. You had thickness in the center, and it was good that you restrained yourself from trying to turn the center into territory previously.

So first you need to settle your floater stones in the center. when they're strong there is a lot of aji to exploit. 'A' looks like a good spot for attack and defense. Attaching at g11 will only help white get stronger unless you can cut for certain. White still has many weaknesses to aim at: f5, o15, n4, o11 area, the center group.]

;W[ig]LB[jg:A]C[Here, you can either play ko or just save stones at k13.]

(;B[jh]C[I 'm ashamed. Let's say I had an hallucination.

This is the game-losing move. The game is still difficult for black, but there is a chance if the black stones are saved.]
