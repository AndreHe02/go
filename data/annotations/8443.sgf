C[Hi, my name is Tim Kington, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm 1d AGA, and somewhere around 1d on KGS (I don't play enough there for a solid rating).  If you have any questions after reading the review, you can reach me at timkington@gmail.com.

Tomplus (Black) :

Dear rewiever, thank you for the time you spend to review this game :)

This was a close game (lost by 2.5 points), and i don't really find big mistakes.

So i would like to have your comments particulary on openning (because it was quite unsual) and direction of play, and of course on whatever you think i can improve.

I've tried to review this game myself, so i've put some variation and some questions.

Thank you again :) (and sorry for my poor english ..)];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[jd]LB[jp:a]C[This isn't bad, but my teacher says that when you're ahead, you should just keep building.  A would be good for that.]
;W[jj]C[This will probably turn out to be a mistake for White.  Corner, side, center.]
;B[dj];W[jp];B[pj];W[nq]

(;B[dq]LB[ep:a]C[This is a mistake.  You should connect at A.]
;W[ep]C[In a situation like this, you MUST block.  It doesn't matter if White can cut and capture something.  The result will still be better than letting him through.]
(;B[do];W[dl];B[cf];W[cd]LB[ef:a]C[This makes you think below.  I would defend at A.]
;B[fc];W[ch]C[How about sealing White in?  See variation.]
(;B[ef];W[eh]C[This move is too nice for White.  You really don't want to let him separate you.]
;B[ed];W[db]LB[mq:a]C[I think you should make White pay for leaving in the lower right now.]
;B[nc];W[qh]LB[qf:a];B[qi];W[qn]C[White is leaving a lot of unfinished positions around.  He'll have to pay for it eventually.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[po];B[qp];W[pn]LB[qk:a][ql:b][rm:c]C[The right move for White would be A or B here, to stay flexible, and attack the stones above.  This is heavy, and you should attack immediately - it will leave White's stones weak, and strengthen yours.  Something simple like C would be fine.]

;B[od]LB[oc:a]C[This will give you bad shape - how about playing A directly?  If White saves his stones you get sente, and if he doesn't, your position is better.]
;W[pf]
(;B[oc]C[Tomplus : I was sure it was sente but ...

So maybe i should not play P17.];W[hc]
(;B[hd]C[Tomplus : I think attacking both E12 and H17 W group was a better solution. But i don't feel really fine with the E14 group, it looks pretty weak to attack with, and i didn't want to help W to build a moyo in the center and use the Tangen.

Do you see any variation for this situation ?

The splitting attack looks interesting.  The way this actually went, you could have killed the group.]

;W[mb];B[kc];W[kb];B[mc];W[lb]C[Now the group dies.  See variation.]
(;B[nb];W[gb];B[fb];W[hb]LB[di:a]C[Tomplus : after this, B wall facing the center doesn't seems to be effective.

If you want it to be effective, you need to use it to attack.  Something starting with A might be interesting.]
;B[mq];W[nr];B[oq];W[mp];B[mr];W[no];B[op];W[nn]
(;B[el]LB[nj:a]C[Tomplus : maybe wrong direction ?

The variation does look better.  I really wouldn't be worried about the left center right now.  You have a stone in there you can run away with sometime, and ways to reduce from above and below.  The right side is the problem - if White surrounds and captures that group, you will have trouble winning.  I would play something like A, and start making that group stronger while reducing the right center.

You should only attach to a stone if you want to make it stronger.  Here you're helping White.  How about just jumping out instead?]

C[Good.  This has been the biggest area for a while.  You seem to like jumps that aren't quite connected.  That can be very dangerous.  A and B both look safer to me.]

;W[oi];B[pi];W[ng];B[li]C[This is a big mistake.  Your group on the right should die now.  Letting the jump get cut will cost a lot of points now.  You should have to play on the side to live, and White will play around here to take the whole center.]
;W[ql];B[rl]LB[rk:a]C[Can't White force you to fight a ko with A?]
(;W[qm];B[rj];W[jh];B[lg];W[lf];B[kf];W[kg];B[kh]C[Good.  Because of White's mistake you lived on the right, and got into the center too.]

(;B[km]C[Tomplus : With next moves I was trying to isolate the L11 W group, but I didn't find the right way :)

Any ideas ?
 L11 is too strong to think about killing, I think.  I would be thinking about protecting your stones on the left.]

(;B[bb]C[Tomplus : I was pretty sure this W corner was not alive but i failled to kill it.

Can you kill it ?

I would try from the outside - that way if you fail to kill it, you still make White's territory smaller, and it will also hurt the territory below.  See variation.]

Save it earlier instead of attacking the corner.  It's worth about twice as much.  I don't see a way to save both sides now.]

Your fighting and reading seem to be pretty good.  The main problems in this game were strategic.  I think you need to focus more on keeping your groups connected, and strengthening weak groups.  If you do that, you'll be able to use your fighting skills in situations where only the opponent's stones are weak.  Failing to kill the group at the top was obviously big - you might try practicing life and death problems to improve in that area.  The long knight's move from the right side group cost a lot, too - getting your groups separated there cost you sente.  The last big problem was not coming back to the weak connection in the upper left early enough.  Look at how little territory White has if you keep that string connected.  If you get back there first, the game never gets close.]
