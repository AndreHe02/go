C[THANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR REVIEW.

I AM PLAYING BLACK AND WIN THE GAME BY 0.5.

I WOULD APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD COMMENT
1) HOW CAN I WIDEN THE WINNING
2) WAS MY THINKING IN BETWEEN THE GAME IS CORRECTyum install AdobeReader_enu


reid: Hello Gabriel,

Hmm, you want to win by more?  But a win by a half point is as good as a win by 100 points.  We could even argue that it is better.  When your opponent is losing by a large margin, he has nothing to lose by trying all kinds of crazy strategies.  But if it's close, he might hope for a small mistake on your part instead.

But I think I know what you mean.  You would like to increase your chances of winning.  Unfortunately, that doesn't work either.  As soon as you get stronger, you will just have to play against stronger players.

Ultimately, the only worthwhile goal is to get stronger.  So let's see if we can do something about that...

Instead of concentrating on just black's play, I am going to comment on both sides.  I think it is important to see the whole game, not just half of it.  By understanding your opponents options and mistakes, you can better understand your own responses.]

LB[ch:C][ck:B][cl:A]C[reid: I think white missed a chance here.  The black moyo is bigger than white's but black has decided to invade.  The usual idea is to build the big moyo bigger, and force your opponent to invade.

But black didn't continue building (G17 and M4 come to mind as ways to build the moyo bigger). To best take advantage of this, I think white should pincer the black stone at white A.  If black runs out, white can chase him around.  If black goes into the corner, white will get outstide thickness.  Either way should be good for reducing black's moyo.

If black wants to invade white's moyo instead of building his, I think it would be better to start with black B instead of C6.  Then black has two ways to extend (to C or to C6)  to create a base on the side]
;B[cj]LB[ck:C][cl:B][bp:A]C[reid: A common joseki is to slide into the corner with A, but that would just give white the opportunity to pincer again (at B).  Extending up the side give black the base he needs.

After black C10, white has a natural invasion point at B, so it is difficult for black to continue with the slide to A later.  Black could also consider C instead of C10 to keep the possibility of A.]
;W[mq]LB[hc:A][qc:C][qf:B]C[reid: K3 and Q3 are low, so approaching with N3 does not seem like the biggest area.  Approaching K16 with A looks bigger.  It is also the natural direction of extension from the D17/C15 shimari.

White seems to be falling behind.  He might need to do something a bit drastic.  Perhaps an invasion at B or C to see if he can stir things up.]
;B[po];W[qm]C[reid: First white induces black to strengthen the corner, then he tries to invade there!  If white wants to invade this corner, he should play N3 at Q5.  After black Q5, it is too late.  Better to try somewhere else.]
;B[qn]LB[pl:A][pm:B]C[I WANT TO STRENGTHEN MY CORNER FIRST AND BY ATTACKING THE R7 TO MAKE MY UPPER RIGHT THICK

Q: AM I RIGHT?

reid:  I like the idea of building thickness to grow the upper right area.  But this move doesn't do that.  Instead, it encourages white to push out into the center.  I think it would be better to enclose the white stone and force him to live in your corner.  Black A or B would work directly to build the upper right corner.  If you want to go from New York to London, you should not start by heading towards San Francisco.]
;W[qj]C[MY OPONENT SEEMS KNOWING WHAT I AM THINKING
NOW I DECIDED TO ATTACK THE R10 INSTEAD AND LET HIM CAPTURE MY R9 SO THAT I CAN BUILD UP THE THICKNESS AT THE UPPER RIGHT IN TRADING WITH A SMALL LIVING GROUP OF WHITE AT THE MIDDLE LOW LEFT.
I BELIEVE MY LOWER RIGHT CORNER IS STRONG ENOUGH TO RESIST ANY ATTACH.

Q: AM I RIGHT?

reid: It's best to assume your opponent knows exactly what you are thinking.  You won't get stronger by tricking your opponents.  You get stronger by developing a deeper understanding of the game.

I would also caution against thinking too far ahead.  In this game, your opponents goal is to ruin all your plans (and you are doing the same to him).  This means you need to re-evaluate the position and situation at nearly every move.  You have done the re-evaluation and decided you can give up the R9 stone. Let's examint that choice...]
;B[pj]LB[pk:A]C[reid: Giving up a single stone is not a large sacrifice, but allowing white to get an eye when he captures R9 is much too easy on him.

Black can get good territory in many places on the right side.  He does not need to rush things here.  Instead of letting white get an easy base, I would rather see black extend solidly with A.  Now white has to do all the work of making two eyes without any help from black.  The longer white struggles, the more black can take advantage of it.  Don't help your opponent settle his stones.]
;W[pk];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[ok];W[pl];B[pi]C[THIS IS WHAT I WANT

Q: IS IT A GOOD TRADE?

reid: White is almost alive and has sente where it was black's sphere of influence.  Black should have gotten more from white's invasion.  Giving up R9 makes it too easy for white.]
;W[qc]C[reid: This invasion is natural.]
(;B[pc]C[reid: It is difficult for black to choose which direction to block.  This way (Q17) ends with a strong black wall, but it is difficult to develop it into territory.  Blocking on the other side leeds to black begin over-concentrated.  See variation.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf];W[pb];B[ob]LB[qf:A]C[PLAYING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I WANT WHITE TO CHOOSE THE MIDDLE RIGHT INSTEAD OF THE UPPER RIGHT

Q:  AM I  CORRECT?

reid: If you think the middle right side is not important, then playing A instead of S14 would be more direct, and would not leave as much aji.  See variation]
(;W[oc];B[od];W[qb];B[nc];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg]
(;B[sf]C[reid: Sacrificing an extra stone here does not work very well.  Instead black should simply atari at Q14.  See variations.]
;W[sg];B[pf];W[qg];B[pg]C[Q: IS THE RESULT FAVOR TO BLACK?]
;W[hd]C[reid: White grabs this important extension first.  Black's wall is not very useful now.]
;B[hc];W[gc];B[ic];W[gd];B[jg];W[bp];B[en]LB[cg:A]C[reid: Black E6 positions two black stones to three white stones here.  Tow against three means black has a numerical disadvantage.

I think extending to A would be better.  If you are going to be weaker (around C6), better to be a lot weaker in exchange for something big elsewhere.  C13 (A) is territory for both sides.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[di];B[dn]C[I WANT TO MAINTAIN MY PASSAGE TO THE MIDDEL AND LET WHITE BUILD THICKNESS AT THE UPPER LEFT.

Q: IS IT A CORRECT CHOICE?

reid: Difficult choice.  D11 is a huge move for both sides. But if black takes it (instead of D6), white will get an advantage in the battle for the center.]
;W[ci];B[dj]LB[bi:A]C[reid: Black D10 is a "push from behind" move.  Better perhaps to hane at A]
;W[ej]C[reid: White follows the proverb and hanes at the head of two stones.]
;B[ek];W[fk];B[ei];W[fj];B[eh];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi];B[dl]C[reid: Black's shape here is very cramped...]
;W[gh]C[reid: and these two black stones are deep in white territory.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[bf];W[cf];B[bh];W[dg];B[ag];W[dh];B[be];W[bd]
;B[ch];W[ae]LB[ah:G][aj:E][ak:B][ck:C][dk:D][bl:A][cl:F]C[reid: White should save this move - it is aji-keshi.  He has too many cutting points on the outside to be able to capture the black stones.  But later, he might get a move that patches up the cuts.  Or he might get the A, through G aji for a ko.  Or he could even start the ko now - he has several local ko threats.]
;B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[eg];B[aj];W[fg];B[ai]C[reid: black connects which gives the D10 stones an extra eye.  Keeping the two black group seperated means they each need two eyes.  White should have gotten a better result here.

Even so, it is not terrible for white - he gained a fair amount (maybe twelve points) of real territory while black only got a few more points.]
;W[oq]
(;B[op]LB[si:E][rl:G][pm:H][rm:F][rn:D][pp:C][qp:B][pr:A]C[reid: Hmm, I would normally think of dropping down to A (Q2) here, but black has to worry about white B, black C, white D.  If it were not for the white connection at E, black could prevent this with black F, white G, black H, then]
;W[nq]LB[or:A]C[reid: White should drop down to A.];B[pr];W[li]
LB[ji:A][gn:F][pn:D][rn:B][qo:E][ro:C]C[reid: Since white can't expect to take center territory (black E6 and P4), he elects to gouge out as much of black's moyo as he thinks he can get.

Counting territory now, it looks like white has perhaps 25 on the lower edge, 35 in the upper left, and about 15 on the right edge.  Black has less than ten on the left, 15 in the lower right, and perhaps thirty five in the center.  This is a no komi game, so white is about fifteen points ahead.  With a lead like that, white could be more conservative.  Reducing while building a little territory with A is one way.  White B through E is also big and helps settle white's remaining liability.  White F might also be a good idea - build this territory up while defending the weak points.]
;B[ji];W[lk];B[ol];W[om];B[ml];W[kh]C[reid: this is another aji-keshi move.  When black responds, he gains more than white does.]
;B[jh];W[ll];B[lm];W[km];B[ln];W[kn];B[lo];W[kp];B[nm];W[jl]
;B[si];W[rn]LB[rm:A]C[reid: Oops.  If white plays A instead, he has two eyes.]
;B[rl];W[sl];B[sm];W[rm];B[sk];W[ql];B[sl]C[UPTO HERE, I BELIEVE THIS FIGHT WILL ENDUP WITH A KO.
I DONOT KNOW WHY WHITE GIVE UP SO SOON

Q: DO YOU KNOW?

reid: After white S6 and black S8, white has no choice.  White cannot kill the S8 stone, so his group has no eyes at all.]
(;W[gn]C[reid: this is a very big move, almost enough to comepensate for losing the R8 group!  In combination with the L 6 stones, white now has about forty points along the bottom.  Earlier we counted only twenty five for white there.]
;B[gm]LB[gb:B][lf:D][bo:C][ms:A]C[I THINK THIS IS THE WORST MOVE I MADE IN THIS GAME

Q: WOULD L13 BE BETTER?

reid: Let's count again, but first remove G7 so there are an equal number of black and white stones.  White has about thirty five in the upper left still, and almost forty along the bottom.  Upper right is twelve.  Total is eighty five.

Black still has eight to ten on left side, and about twenty five on the top edge and center.  But his lower right corner is now forty two points.  Total is seventy five.  The margin has narrowed, but white is still ahead.  Black needs ten points to pull even.  He needs big sente endgame moves.

A, B, C, and D are all big.  But probably only A is certain sente.  D might be reverse sente - White D would be very damaging.]

;W[jo];B[lj];W[mj];B[kj];W[mk];B[mi]C[reid: This is dangerous for black.  He cuts off some white stones, but he has some weaknesses he needs to worry about.  There is still aji in the R7 stones.]

C[reid: Is this move necessary?  Perhaps black A is safer.  O6 cannot get away, and if white tries to cut off the S11 stones with B or C, black D keeps white's liberties under control.]
;W[qp];B[pp];W[nj];B[nl];W[oh]C[IF WHITE DO NOT GIVE UP BY PLAYING P12, I THINK HE CAN LIVE AT THE CORNER.

Q: AM I RIGHT

reid: Probably.  White doesn't actually have to live.  He just needs to get liberties as he *threatens* to live.  If he can get six libertiesand sente, he can play at P12 or R12 and capture some black stones.

White S2 instead of P12 looks pretty dangerous for black.

White has been ahead for most of this game.  Black had an early lead, but he allowed white to settle his R7 invasion stone in sente, which let white get to R17 first.  This left black a little behind.  White made a few tactical mistakes in the end that let his lead slip away.

I would say that black's high-level strategic instincts are good.  You should work on translating the strategic instincts into solid tactictical moves that follow those instincts in a straight line.  Make your moves direct and to the point, with each one working directly towards your current strategic and tactical goals.  This game is difficult enough without adding extra complications.  And watch out for moves that help your opponent (aji-keshi).  Just because it's sente it doesn't mean it's a good move.

Good luck, play strong,
