C[This was a game I played for a tournement. I play Black. I thought the opening was going ok, but then on some point I lost grip on the game. Can you tell me what my major mistakes were?

D: Hi Peter ! My name is David (SolarBear on KGS and IGS) and I'll be reviewing your game. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me by email at solarbear AT gmail DOT com or on KGS (SolarBear).]
;B[pc];W[dq];B[qe];W[qp]
(;B[cc]C[D: This, to my knowledge, is not common, but I found a few examples of pro games with that opening. See variation, however.]
;W[kc]
(;B[df]C[7) my purpose was to get a moyo on the left side

D: I wouldn't go so far saying this is a mistake, but this feels like a major direction of play problem. This move feels inconsistent with Black's choice of the 3-3 point as an opening move. By playing this point, Black choose to get some cash in the bank at the cost of getting a slower development. Developing a 3-3 stone should not be a priority, especially not since it leaves the top side wide open for White to take.

See variations for ideas.];W[gd]C[D: Natural : White needs to settle his stones and doesn't want to be fall behind in influence. However, his position is pretty thin and thus easily invadable.]
(;B[do]C[D: White's position at the top is very thin while Black's a lot more solid ! Attack ! (See var.)]
;W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[br];B[cl]C[So far as I planned

D: Black does get a pretty balanced position on the left side.]
;W[ec]C[D: Good move : helps settle White's thin group and attacks Black's enclosure.]
(;B[cd]C[17) not sure how to play here.

D: This is really submissive ! See variations for ideas.];W[pj]
TR[qe]C[D: Bad move relating to Black's marked stone : Black could simply slip under the stone and rob White of his precious territory. This does, however, suggest that White is preparing some kind of framework on the lower side...]
;B[mc]C[D: Good move !];W[ke]SQ[pj][fp][qp]C[D: This move secures White's top group and gives him the beginning of a huge moyo...]
(;B[qh]C[19 and 21 alsoo as planned, so I am still pretty happy.

D: Approaching the bottom right corner is urgent, otherwise White will get a big moyo.]
;W[op]C[D: Ouch. White's moyo is looking dangerous...]
(;B[kq]CR[ke][df][pj][do][fp][op][qp]TR[jp][kp][jq]C[23 was this the move?

D: In the circumstances, this move or any of the marked ones is pretty much obligatory. Black needs to stop White from expanding his framework.

From the looks of the board at this moment, it seems to me that Black is behind in influence (have a look at the circled stones) but is CLEARLY ahead in territory. I think a move on the 4th line would have been required, here, to stop White from controlling the middle. At this point Black cannot stop White from getting territory on the right and especially the bottom, but could limit its expansion.

This is one of the great lessons one must learn in go (which I'm still learning :P) : do not be greedy and look for a balance in all things. Since Black is ahead in territory, he could leave some to White to better control White's influence of the whole board.]
;W[mq];B[hq]C[D: Natural.];W[gq];B[hp];W[fn];B[ko]C[D: Pretty much forced.]
;W[mn]C[D: Good move by White, keeping pressure on Black while expanding.]
(;B[ci]TR[pj][mn][op][qp][mq]C[31 or must i run at H6? But then I thought I push white into my left side so I decided D11 or C11

D: This is overprotective : Black's groups are safe while White moyo on the right is getting stronger: remember my comment on the balance of territory and influence. Black needs to stop White ! (See vars.)]
;W[hn]C[D: Hurts Black and helps White maintain his control of the center.]
(;B[km]C[D: Exactly White's plan. See var.];W[ml];B[db]C[35 Afterwards I find it a bad move

D: You're right : Black doesn't gain much from this and it actually helps White settle. Dealing with the right side is urgent.]
;W[me];B[rj];W[jr]C[38 oei

D: See vars.]
(;B[gr];W[fr];B[ir];W[gs];B[io]SQ[hs]C[43 is this ok?

D: No : see previous variations. Black could have got an eye and no ko, which he'd get by playing at H1 here.]
(;W[hr];B[kr];W[iq];B[jq];W[is]
(;B[ip]C[49 or better on N2?

D: N2 would have been better; White can't cut, see var.];W[lp]
;B[kp];W[jn];B[kn]C[53 ??

D: Right response : answering at K5 would give an eye to the group but would enable White to play L6 himself, pretty much sealing Black off.]
;W[in]
(;B[jl]TR[kk][hn][in][jn]C[55 trying to capture marked stones

D: Bad idea ! Black's L2 group is weak : NEVER use weak groups to attack. Make sure your group is alive first, THEN attack. There's a famous go proverb on this matter : "Make a fist before striking". (http://senseis.xmp.net/?MakeAFistBeforeStriking)

Also, if you're trying to flee, the one space skip to L9 is faster and safer.]
;W[kk]C[D: White is making profit while attacking Black.];B[hl]
;W[jk];B[ik]C[D: Right answer.];W[kl];B[jm];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi]
;B[gj];W[gi];B[fl]C[D: F10, otherwise the hane of W10 really hurts Black's shape.]
;W[fj]
(;B[go]C[D: Black's group is still not alive. A double table shape (see variation) would get Black out of trouble.]
;W[fo];B[gn];W[cn];B[dn];W[el];B[fm];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[ck]
;W[bo]
(;B[ek]C[D: Small : a move at R9 would have completely changed the shape of the game (var.)]
;W[ri];B[ii]TR[gi][hi][fj]C[83 I thought I could capture the marked stones was bigger then playing at R11, but afterwards I regretted my choice.

D: Bad idea ! Corner is bigger than side, side is bigger than center: never forget this. Center stones will have an easy time escaping while White's moyo is becoming all-encompassing.]
;W[jj];B[ih];W[qi];B[hg]C[87 stay with my plan];W[fg]C[D: BIG mistake from White here. The F11 cut could prove to be fatal.]
(;B[gf]C[D: See variations, you'll see what I meant for White's previous move.]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[ee];B[ge];W[ef];B[ed];W[fd];B[dd]C[97 sofar as planned]
;W[gg];B[jf]TR[ee][ef][ff][fg][gg][gi][hi][fj]C[99 I doubted about H16, H14 and K14. Went for K14 so i had more change to make life for black, some doubt about getting captured the marked stones]
;W[hf];B[he];W[ie];B[hd]C[103 ?];W[id];B[hc];W[if]
(;B[fc]C[D: Turning at J17 would be bigger, since the F16 stones aren't going anywhere anyway.]
;W[dg];B[fi]C[D: Too late for this.];W[ei];B[rh];W[sh];B[sg]
;W[si];B[rf];W[ph];B[of];W[ng]
(;B[nd]C[D: There are still a few moves worth playing before this. See variations.]

;B[gc];W[ha];B[gb];W[ia];B[ld]C[D: Forcing White with G19 would be worth 1 pt in sente.]
;W[kd];B[le];W[lf];B[mf]C[D: See variation.];W[nf];B[og];W[oh]
;B[ga];W[ja];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac]C[D: First, let me say : well played ! I notice your opponent was SEVEN stones stronger than you were. I think you should be proud of this game.

Now, a few comments and pieces of advice :

1. Do tsumego ! Practicing your reading skills will allow you to detect traps like White's innoncent-looking play at L18 or a move like W B10. I know for a fact that most players do not do enough tsumego - I know I don't. :)

2. Carefully evaluate, regularly during the game, the balance of territory and influence. If you're ahead in territory but not lagging in influence, be ready to leave some territory for your opponent to get if it allows you to negate a part of his influence. The opposite is also true. If you're ahead in both territory and influence well, you're winning, so never mind. :)

3. Try to detect if your opponent is trying to create a moyo. Stop him from making one and if he succeeds, act quickly : play lightly to reduce the moyo as much as possible.

4. Do tsumego ! Yeah, I know I'm annoying but it's important.

5. Do not be hasty in developing a 3-3 point stone. It is not meant for development even though an enclosure will not hurt you, it's not as urgent as on a 3-4 stone. If you ever get the chance to read Kajiwara Takeo's excellent (but pretty advanced) book "The Direction of Play", he describes it as kind of a "fire and forget" move. Let the game develop and create an enclosure when the time is right.

6. Spend some time evaluating the relative strength and weakness of groups, both yours and your opponent's. For instance, after W 8, Black had a strong position in both the top corners so invading would have been the proper move but Black missed the opportunity, letting White settle himself without much effort. On the other hand, you obviously overestimated the strength of your bottom group when fleeing, thinking of attacking a few stones instead.

7. Finally, tsumego. Really.

I hope you enjoyed the review. Cheers !
