C[Hi!
Thanks for reviewing my game.

I'm white and I suffered a big loss of almost 30 points, in my opinion due to both strategical and tactical mistakes. The game was played quite quickly, that is in about 40 minutes, but I think the mistakes I made here are representative of mistakes I'd do anyway so I think analyzing this game will very interesting for me.

I've added some comments myself : I'm usually able to tell that something's a mistake but not to say what should have been played.

Timm

Thanks for game, I saw my self in Whites play and thought numerous times did i play like this?? And *sigh* yes i did, guess that's why they call it 7k...
The way it reminds me of how i solved my stagnation in rankdevopment is the same now as it is then, didn't put in to many variations, cause i coundn't see a style of play. It was rather like W was trying to put out the fires where ever they pop up.  My tip about that is take 5 openings as B and 5 as W and stick with them for the next 100-200 games then you find out if you like longrange bombarment or closecombat fighting, biulding moyos or invading(even your own invasions, if need be ;-)...)

If i have to choose move that stands out and loses the game, unfortunately it gonna be K4, don't like to choose it, but instead of walking up the hill to win, O17 started the process but K4 transformed the hill into K2 mountain...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf]C[I havn't read "the chinese opening" but played against it (due to its popularity) many times, and from my experince its aim is to either get the side or crush you opponent in som advanced joseki.
I would play J3 instead of O17 with M3 as follow up, and see if B aims for something like K16 or if he wants to start fight around the 3 line. Perhaps divide and conquer style of play with R14

I guess we both have to read it... :D
So we don't fall for "the chinese opening" 's traps... they can be overwhelming heavy to recover from. Been there, done that and no F-way i wanna do it again... ;-)]
;W[jd]C[L17 rather, or O17 at N17 to avoid weakness at M16/M17. Harmless now but can become very costly very fast..]

(;B[fq]
(;W[jp]LB[fo:C][iq:A][dr:B]C[I think this was a terrible strategical mistake, but I really don't understand why.

I've played that game to, when "bing" I know this is bad but i don't know why...
My sulotion : do something else.
Yes i know it sound like the mother of all cliche, but it's true. If you keep playing this move and you keep losing and your analysis keep telling you this move blow it (14 losses or 432 losses in a row doesn't matter), do something else.

Unfortunately I'm a hard learner, so i thought when i got stuck at 6k for a(wery) long time that, OK 6k might be my max...but stubborn(as hell) that i am i started to read books, took lessions, played countless games... Nothing worked until i did something else, even if it ment playing the D10, R17, R4 or even D3, heck even 1-1 point was playble to me, because, i did something else.

But don't take this move as bad, it isn't. Most likly aim for W is D-line wall and N3 then if E3 if B don't go for the corner. High risk style because is very obvious what your aim is...

That about the "Finding my misstake and correcting them" lession :)

This pincer leaves to many options for B, it's like you wanna pinch someone but all you do is pet them...

If you played H3 instead then only B and C is left and B is not really ok this early in the game, but H3 is also the star of a common joseki that at this moment would be very bad.
F4 is my alt. but it has it's complications.
You could also just mirrorplay at C6, B most likly J3 and invade around N3.]

(;B[mp]C[even though G-H3 seems to thight to me I can't really see any options, letting that F3-stone grow strong is not an option....]

[hn][nn][pn][fp]C[bye, bye K4, good luck... Only way it has run  now is to the center. And running with a dead/cut off stone is the best way make a dragon that if it doesn't die, lives at the cost of everything else....

Perhaps a bit silly illustation but the point is leave K4 now and build some thing in center then run in and try to rescue K4 if you find it worth it.

But if you are lucky and catch your opp. off guard your dead dragon in the center turns into a dragon of death, but your opp. problably given up before that happens, because letting dragon of death out, yeah, even i run to the other side of the galaxy, aka give up when that happens....

Circle=Dead dragon (it lives but B got everything around it)
Sqare=B stones (Black is just about everywhere W wants to be)
Triangels+Circles= Dragon of death (W has compleatly and utterly crushed B)]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[jo];B[hn];W[go]C[This was a bad idea. I was a bit desperate since nothing seemed to be any good. I guess I should just bear with the fact that I'm the one being chased and run...

yes, K7 because that K-line is wondering if there is light at the end of the tunnel...B is ahead of W so every time W trys to run B gets happier. Right side is B's (gonna take som mean invading to change that) left side still open, but if W get there first K-line dies, K-line lives left side's gone...]

Yes, one more stone would be nice. My experince have thoght me the 3-3 is usually quite vital to the corner, so goard it in some way.]

Why not C? Break the ladderbreaker];B[dh];W[fk];B[fl];W[ej]
C[My idea was to build a wall to attack black's top group with E13/F13 but it didnt really work.  The ide is good but a bit late, Bambujoint even though extended like this is still wery strong, especilly when CD12 have, what ever stone should have, at least 2 options. C10 and E13.

Otherwise O11 seems big and there's of course the problem with the bottom left (that I wasn't thinking about anymore).

Just gonna remind you of some fundamentals that you perhaps havn't thought of, coners got 2 side that can be attacked, sides got 3, but the center got between 4 and 9 sides depending on size.
If center at stake here, then W O11 triggers B K12, if W K12 then B N12 or even M12.
Never aim to build territory in the center just let i happen, otherwise it's like eating peas with chopsticks and your opp. have spoons in a pea eating competion, doable but afully tiersome...

And if you have only one(wholeborad sized) group when the dust settles, 8 out of 10 times you win.]
