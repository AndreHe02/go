Hi there, My name is Guilherme and i'm very new on this game.

I'm playing against the computer cause i'm not good at this, but i'm trying.


Hi Guilherme

I tried to explain some of the ideas behind the white stones in the opening. Try to develop your stones by attacking your oppenent is the best way to keep the initiative. After a bad start you improved in the later parts of the game. You missed the chances to kill two white groups. Try the following books. You may find them helpful:
1) "In the Beginning" by Ikuro Ishigure
2) "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama
3) "Lectures on Go Techniques" by Cho Hun-hyeon

Enjoy your Go life

Best wishes

Ralf

;B[qd]C[  I'm studying fusekis, so if you can make a comment at the end of the fuseki or tell me some mistakes or better moves i'd appreciate.]
;W[qq];B[dc];W[cq]LB[dn:B][pn:H][do:A][po:G][ep:C][fp:D][np:E]
[op:F]TR[cq][qq]C[Ok, let's stop here for a moment and have a look at the two marked white stones. White's intention is to deny black access to the corner. So if Black wants to attack he must build his position in the centre or along one side of the board, where it is harder to find security.   In case that black doesn't play against white's stone White will build a shimari (enclosure) along one of the points A to H as a preparation for a long extension along the side.    There are two possibilites how to answer. See variations]

(;B[pp];W[pq];B[op];W[qp]C[N: Your following up move doesn't look right to me as the idea behind  your kakari (corner approach) from the outside is to get a centre faced position. See variation.]

(;B[qo];W[ip];B[dn]TR[ip][cq]C[C: Good!! You've decided to reduce White's potential territory which would be quite big if you imagine another White stone on the position of yours.]
;W[fp];B[lp]LB[kq:A][ir:B]C[N: It stops White's progress on the fourth line but playing on the third gives you the opportunity to use White's open bottom to reduce its potential territory. Black 'A' followed by 'B' if White plays elsewhere.]
;W[nd]
(;B[qf]LB[oc:B][pf:A]C[  Is this move too slow?

N:  Yes, it is too slow. This white kakari stresses side and centre on expense of the corner. You have 2 possibilities to answer: 'A' or 'B'. In relation to your strategy on the lower side of the board to gain influence, the play at 'A' would be better.]
;W[ce]TR[ce][dn]C[N: Your move is too passive.   Let's stop here for a moment and consider the left side of the bord. White's play on c15 has several purposes: 1) It prevents you from making a shimari in the upper left corner, 2) intents to push you along the 3rd line on the top thus building influence and walling you off from the centre, and 3) launching and attack on your isolated black stone by building a moyo on the upper left side down in direction of your stone.    There are several different ways how you can answer this white kogeima kagari either by a squeeze play with a one, two or three space pincer, low or high with the aim to prevent white to make much territory on the lower side and the possibility to make use of your isolated black stone.  Try to keep pressure on white.   A way to make best use of your marked stone could be variation 'A'. The others are for refence to show further possibilities in this position.]

(;B[fc]TR[dn];W[cj];B[cg]TR[cg];W[lc]C[N: White's intention is to build a base for its two stones on the top and then to gain influence in the centre or to attack your two stones on the on the upper right of the board . I would cap white at O 14 and map out a mojo on the right side. See variation]

(;B[od]C[N: The idea is not bad as you want stop his progress into the corner but remember that an attachement is going to strengthen your oppenent which is favourable as his two stones are still weak. P 18 would be better. You defend the corner and attack white by taking him the base for its stones. But the variation is still better as it makes an invasion around R10 more difficult for White.]
;W[qj]C[N: Better see variation. Try to attack the single White stone.]

(;B[pj]C[N: Better: R 8 to attack W R10 and to build a base for your group.]
;W[jd]TR[cg][dn]C[N: You have 2 weak groups on the board. You should take care of one of them. See variation]

(;B[id];W[cm];B[dm];W[ro];B[pm]C[N: Better R6 with the aim to block him as S6 and you keep White low, crawling on the second line.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[rn];B[gn];W[qn];B[pn];W[oq];B[io];W[jr]C[  With the white move should I To defend the lower right?

N: If you fear to be cut into two groups then prevent White from going higher than 4th line. You can play K5 for instance but it is a slow move. Your following attack on the lower left is a good idea. Have a look at the variation which follow a bit later. There I tried to show you a way how you can prevent white from cutting you. Move 76]
