RE[W+1.5]

C[Hello, dear reviewer!

This was the first game after a while that I (HonFu) played with slow time limits. It ended very close, but I am sure there are a lot of mistakes. Please help me see more than I saw in the game. I have added my ideas and feelings so that you can correct my thinking.

Thank you!

Dear HonFu,

There are a lot of things to learn from this game!  I think you're well poised to move to 3dan if you can make some of the changes I suggest.

First realize that the comments I make are about improving your Go.  They are not intended to mock, disrespect, hurt, or any other negatively invoked feeling, I am just commenting as I comment.  Since you're submitting this game for review, I assume that you want to improve; so, my comments will be somewhat harsh at times.

One of the main things you need to do now that you're 2dan is fix your idea about using patterned play.  You see patterned play as a crutch against playing living Go.  Getting to 2dan required tsuke nobi, cross cut extend, but to reach ever higher levels, you must embrace that each Go is unique. Read the chapter in Way of Go called Sorry.  It is about this sense.  

Another main improvement area is being aware of what stage of the game you're in.  If in the middle game, don't dwell on end game.  If in a fight, don't worry so much about territory.  In a few instances in this one game, you leave the middle of battle to find some small territorial advantage.  Urgent before big is a nuanced understanding but you are currently erring on the side of big.  

Also, you seem to get fixated on previously calculated moves.  Remember, the board changes with every move.  Yes, in some situations, like tsumego, a situation can sit unplayed until some does the proper reading and have that be independent from the rest of the action, but most all other plays' value changes with every stone struck.  You tend to fixate on things you've already looked at and thought were good.  The game is too dynamic to get fixated like that.

Finally, you need to c-o-u-n-t.  Yes, slow, drudgery, boring stuff of accountants, yet it is a vital skill to raise your level of play.  Knowing the score should influence whether you need to invade a moyo, reduce, or just keep having more territory.  You tend to decide that you need to invade before really knowing that from the count.  Count!

Here's to your progress up the ranks!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]
;B[oc];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]
(;B[nq]C[WOG: This is certainly normal... when you want to break things up, try q10 ;). I'll stop reviewing so much for Black.]
;W[qi];B[qg]C[WOG: Normally this is a forcing move against this group]
(;W[ce]C[WOG: So, playing away isn't always best];B[ql]C[WOG: One doesn't have to enter right away, yet Black elects to]
;W[rm];B[qj]C[HonFu: Here my opponent deviated from the variations I know. Do you think I found the best solution or not?

WOG: The mindset is pattern dependent.   Stop with that now.  You're 2dan.  While this particular circumstance is quite usual, don't depend on patterns to guide you.  Your own strength should guide your play more.]
(;W[rj]C[WOG: I don't like this one... too submissive]
(;B[pi];W[qk];B[pj];W[ri];B[pk];W[rk];B[qh]C[Hon: Here I had to choose between Q8, which is large and ensures my later progress into the center (which will be stopped later in the game) and K16, a major influence point. Quick vs. thick - did I make the right choice?

WOG: Yes.  Too slow to take Q8.  Play on the side.];W[jd]C[Hon: I chose the development point.

WOG: You do owe something to the opponent, but nothing insurmountable at this point]
(;B[cn];W[dk];B[en]
(;W[fq]C[WOG: Why low?  Point here is not to make territory in the lower left is it?  The point is to build the White double shimari?  If so, coordinate your moves to follow the same goal.]
;B[bp]
(;W[cq]C[WOG: This is uncoordinated to your plans... better to do side.]
;B[bk]C[Hon: I have read that this is not considered joseki anymore because you can punish black severely with a move like C8, but I did not remember exactly how, so ...

WOG: Yes, the position is fraught with peril, but the stone at f3 lends no help!  And, the variations around c8 are no help to the situation on the board.  Remember, patterns are just patterns.  Living Go means playing the right move for the ENTIRE board.  No set pattern once the stones are in play.

In this circumstance Black has invaded your double wing.  That was preventable.]
(;W[dm]C[WOG: I despise this move.  Yes, it's a pattern.  Yes, I see it played in multiple matches by low dan players.  However, It settles Black when Black need not be settled.  If you must play this, play b10 instead]
;B[co];W[bl]C[Hon: ... I chose the old technique since it seemed to work well with my moyo on top.

WOG: Ugh... see earlier variations.  B10!  Even when Black deviates from the pattern, you still follow it. 

I am not saying patterns are bad.  Patterns exist for a reason.  However, it's like religion.  Do you pray or worship or chant because of the pattern of the words, or do these words strike meaning with every recounting?  In Japanese you don't "play" Go stones, you "strike" them.]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[bm];W[bj];B[al]C[Hon: Now again the decision - solid or quick. I wanted N17, but C11 looked honteish.

WOG: C11 is sort of, but it's only because of the bad play at B8.  Remove B8 from your play, except in the most FITTING circumstances.]
;W[mc]C[Hon: This looked just too yummy, I could not resist.

WOG: Given what's here, this seems fine];B[ec]C[Hon: When he came in here I thought how to resist and had the impression I should play in a way that helps my C9 stones ...

WOG: See how bad a move B8 is... affects your thinking about the invasion here.]
(;W[dd]C[WOG: Normally, you should play e16 instead... still better IMHO]
;B[db]
(;W[cb]C[WOG: Always check is this is the best way to go...]
;B[hc];W[ib];B[hb];W[ic];B[he];W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[gh];W[ff]
C[WOG: What's this move?  Looks like you're threatening to cut.  However, there's no gain really for you when Black connects, so... don't play it.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[hh]
(;W[ci]C[Hon: ... so I played like this, making a unified position of the left side. But the center is beginning to look thick for black. Maybe here already was the beginning of what will be hard for me later, just I did not recognize.

It seems that I can not play all the good moves I would like to. J3 looked important, also something like N14, but I thought, if I do not defend at C11, the former moves will make no sense.

WOG: So many thoughts directed because of B8.  Cringe worthy.  You have time to fix this after the battle in the middle.  You're walking away to shore up territory when there's a middle game battle going on, live, elsewhere.  Middle game, then End game...

Besides, all this move is doing is preventing big end game.  If Black cuts, the ladder works for you.]
;B[hq]C[Hon: That hurt quite a bit.

WOG: Black's profit for B8.];W[bq];B[ji]C[WOG: Ugh!  Terrible.  Black gets everything.]
;W[qc]C[Hon: I played this as a kind of probe, although probes is a topic I know way too little about. I wanted to find out, how he defends here so I know what to do about the cutting point at J15 or the endgame point around O18.

WOG: May be too late to be probing.  White's already hurt by k11.]
;B[pc]C[Hon: Since he strengthened himself here ...];W[mf]C[Hon: I did so too and thought that o18 would increase in value as a sente move for later.

WOG: Again, you're thinking about end game too much when the middle game has to be played.  Nonetheless, some reinforcement of these stones is a good thing.  The one positive of the solid play at c11 is that now you can cut the stones at j11.  Reinforcing here makes it more feasible.]
;B[on]C[Hon: But black played another point which I would have liked to occupy. Already I don't know, how to safely reduce his center.

WOG: You must count to decide things.  Not, just think, how do I reduce.  If you told me, I am 20 points behind, therefore I need to gamble everything to reduce/invade, I'd be all for your decision making.  Not sure you've done that.  Playing safe, honte, proper, pattern, joseki, tesuji, invasion, reduction, etc. is all for not if the successful result of those is still a lost game.  The only way to see where you are in the game is to count.  Sorry, I know... counting is boring.  Counting is for accountants.  Counting is not the fun part of Go  (unless you're an accountant).  But, counting is the determiner of strategy.  Counting is part and parcel of the graceful art of resigning.  Fast games, OK, I know, don't count.  Playing 45 min a side, you have time to count.]
;W[pl]C[Hon: I thought, this is patient, thick and profitable, and it will help me get out into the center.

WOG: Think instead, what's the score.  If I protect here, am I still ahead??]
(;B[ol]C[WOG: Too tight against White here];W[om];B[nm];W[nn]
(;B[nl]C[WOG: Ugh... What territory is Black looking to make?  Costly mistake for Black]
;W[no]C[Hon: This felt good for me. I thought that black maybe has not found the best solution here.

WOG: I'd say.];B[lo]C[Hon: He found some kind of keypoint for central influence, but now at least he has to pay for what he is building, so ...

WOG: This is a nothing play.];W[mp]C[Hon: ... I just take what he offers.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[lq];W[mr];B[go]C[Hon: Still, his moyo looks big.

WOG: Change your mindset to "Black's (are you sure that chiken15 is a male?) moyo looks to be about X points.  I have Y points, which is +/- Z points with this moyo realized.  Therefore, I should _______"]
(;W[gk]C[Hon: After some thinking I came here under the impression that I still have aji around D8 to help me keep my stone connected. But it was not that easy, and from now on it becomes a bit messy.

WOG: D8 is not the key point.  The Black stones above can be disconnected.  The point is not to disconnect them, but to gain leverage from their potential disconnectedness to reduce.  Again, if the score so dictates.]
;B[fk]C[WOG: ??  Seems to hurt the cut]
(;W[fl]C[WOG: Doh!  You're so focused on D8, you're forgetting about that big group up above.]
;B[fj]C[WOG: Doh!  Now Black has practically fixed the cut.]
;W[dl]C[WOG: And you're still fixated on the ko potential... not good.]
;B[gl];W[dn]C[Hon: I thought this sure must be sente, but ...

WOG: Because you've fixated on the move.  Don't do that.];B[fm]
C[Hon: ... he played here and still threatens to come out with D5.]
;W[gp]C[Hon: I took this, because after he defends here, the cut at E5 if he pushes, is reactivated, but ...]
;B[ep]C[Hon: ... again he frustrates my aims.];W[eo]C[Hon: Luckily I found this one, leading into the same variation that I had seen.]
;B[hp];W[cm]C[Hon: Now I felt like - let the fun begin. But he found a way out of this ugly ko.]
;B[do];W[fo];B[an];W[bl];B[bo];W[ak];B[dq];W[dr];B[cp];W[eq]
;B[dp]C[Hon: Only at this point I saw that I had missed something crucial in my reading. So I have to let him live and also steal my corner - ugly. I could only hope I'd find a way to at least rumble out into the center.]
;W[fp];B[er]
(;W[fr]C[WOG:  AAAAaaaaaiaiiiigigigghhghghghghghhgg!!!!!!  I think this move is wrong.]
;B[cr];W[es];B[br];W[gn];B[ho];W[gm];B[hl];W[el]C[Hon: I thought he would answer this. But I suppose this was just not sente enough.]
;B[mh]C[Hon: This was so annoying.];W[nb];B[ob]
(;W[ro]C[WOG: This is aji keshi I believe];B[rp];W[sp];B[sq]
;W[so];B[rr];W[kh];B[ki];W[lh];B[li];W[mg];B[rh]C[Hon: This again gave me a feeling like - what am I doing? This was bigger! First play this in sente, THEN play in the center. It seems I lost a lot of points in the endgame. Or is my judgement off?

WOG: Yes, you lost points here and there.];W[hm];B[im];W[il]
;B[hk];W[in];B[jm];W[hn];B[jn];W[io];B[eb]C[Hon: This was so annoying. Another endgame point I was watching for an eternity, fell into the hands of my opponent. He really tenukied consequently.

WOG: This time the tenuki comes at a cost.];W[jq]C[Hon: I just hoped this would work out, because now I really was in need of points.

WOG: Analysis always needs to be, how many points did Black lose by giving up these stones vs. how many points did Black gain by playing at e18.  Please do the analysis]
;B[jr];W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[WOG: Dead stones moving...];W[kr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lr]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[hr]C[Hon: Luckily these stones really did die. Was this necessary, or did he mess up?

WOG: No way to save the stones, but there are ways of being subtler.]

;B[mi];W[og];B[nf];W[ne];B[of];W[oe];B[pf];W[pe];B[qe];W[or]
;B[pr];W[fh];B[ca]C[Hon: Endgame is so tricky. I knew this was another huge point, but I felt it was more important to play F12 so that he can not enter my territory in sente from there.

After this it's only endgame and I win by 1,5. In hindsight I feel like I lost a lot in the early endgame (which was never my strong part), so if you have some recommendations about how to think about these kind of positions, that would certainly help a lot.

Okay, that's all. Thanks for the review!

WOG: Please read up on endgame.  Many good books out there.  Also watch a lot of pro game end game.  Do end game problems.  That should help a lot.]
