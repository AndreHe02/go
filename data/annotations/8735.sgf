C[Dear reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to review this game.

I lost this game by 5.5 points but as you will see it was after a few 30+ points mistakes made by me and my opponent in turn.

Some of those mistakes I have identified, and I suggest a more correct move in the sgf file. Could you please tell me if the alternate move I suggest are correct ?

At other times in the game, I fell really at a loss as to what to play. At such moves, I wrote a comment and marked which moves I considered for you to evaluate.

I also have questions and remarks about miscellaneous moves in the game and I'd be happy if you could answer them/tell me when I'm wrong.

You should also feel free to comment on my other moves, even those about which I haven't written anything ! :)

J: Hi, My name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[qn]TR[ep]C[J: the approach move at E4 is more common.  It has the benefit of breaking up white's side and reducing a corner.]

LB[dj:a]C[Correct extension for W is at A, so my move makes W a tad overconcentrated, right ?

J: Correct.  Although C11 isn't unplayable.];W[df];B[be]TR[on]
[jk]LB[ff:a]C[I was also considering A to attack the W group, but then I thought I had to rob it of his base with B15 first.

J: B15 is a bit slow.  It's very difficult to attack the white group here since white has friends on the lower left.  rather, a or the marked points can be played to extend your large framework.]
;W[eq];B[eo]TR[jk]LB[on:a][jj:b][qc:c][ff:d]C[Pretty dull fuseki until now, so I felt at a loss at where to launch an attack now.

A, B, C  and D are other moves I considered. E5 felt like the most aggressive move.

J: I would prefer a,d or the mark.  C is a little one-dimensional, since both sides can be invaded later.  After K9, E5 is easier.]
;W[dm]TR[co]C[J: D7 is a mistake. as there is a gaping weakness at C5.]
;B[fq]C[J: C5 is an easier reduction.  I would still consider K9 at this point.  Living locally here would be falling into white's hands and most likely ending in gote.]
;W[ep];B[fp]C[I was expecting a white play at F2, and wasn't sure what to play now.]
;W[fo]
(;B[go]LB[er:a]C[Since my goal was to invade and settle quickly, maybe A would have been better ? (see variation - is it correct ?)]
;W[fn];B[hp];W[io];B[iq];W[jq];B[er];W[dr];B[dq]LB[fr:a]C[This was clearly a mistake. Simply A would have been better ?

J: J2 to make easy life.  even with black living here, white is happy to get sente.]
;W[dp];B[cr];W[ds];B[cq];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[jr]C[J: difficult to see how to live now.]
;W[ir];B[hq];W[kr];B[kq]C[L3 is unreasonable.];W[jp];B[lr];W[js]
;B[lq]C[I thought that, since I lost my chance to settle my G2 group, I might as mell cut W's groups apart and fight.]

;B[er];W[ho];B[gp];W[hm];B[gn];W[gm];B[cs]LB[il:a]C[Here I thought of playing A to raise the ante on this ko fight.

Rather, I chose to let his group get away and mine settle.]
;W[il]
(;B[mn]TR[pf]C[J: sacrificing this group is an option.  Q14 is huge.  You are well compensated by taking the left corner.  There is an extremely large end-game move at B4, see variation.]

;W[oj];B[pi];W[nj]C[J: O11 is betting for white here because it also threatens to reduce the right side.]

;B[rm];W[rn];B[ro]C[J: black should simple S8 here.  A couple points difference.]
;W[sn];B[rl];W[qo];B[fm]TR[qj]C[J: this cut may be aji-keshi (erasing possiblities).  The cutting F7 stone may die, and a loss of left corner eng-game.  Black also needs to be wary of the R10 weakness.]
;W[en];B[fl];W[ij];B[jh];W[oh]C[J: P12 should be at H12 to kill the cutting F7 stone.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[nh];W[qj]C[J: R10 can be left for later. an invasion around Q17 is timely.]
;B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[pj];B[ng];W[li];B[ki];W[kp]C[J: L4 is dame.]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[ln];W[ml];B[nl]C[J: M12 is pushing through a very small door.]
;W[lh];B[hh];W[lf]C[J: J10 is under a lot of pressure.];B[fj]
;W[hi]TR[gi]C[J: white should threaten to cut F10 off.  But the losses incurred is not worth M14.]

;B[kb];W[jb];B[kc]LB[fb:a]C[I realized later this move let white live easily.

Maybe I had nothing to fear from playing at A and let W play L17 ?

J: no, that's too risky.  taking sente now is fine.  The game is still even.]
;W[fb];B[db];W[ga];B[ls]C[J: wasted move.];W[nr]TR[qc]C[J: white should not respond.  R17 instead.]

C[White wins by 5.5 points.

J: I think the main take away from this game, is just to practice reading more.  Doing a lot of go problems will help.  Also, in the opening don't be too jealous of your opponent's framework when you can make an even larger one.

Thanks for showing me this game.])
