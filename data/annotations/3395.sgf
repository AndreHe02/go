C[I'm white.     This outcome of this game is determined by a complex (for me) fight involving multiple weak groups.   It's the sort of thing I'm terrible at managing.

* Hi Calvin, 

I am Mohit K. Gupta, currently 8k on kgs, and been playing for 1 year now ^^".  Most of my go is from books, b/c that how i learned ^^.  So if you find something strange blame the pro's who wrote those books :P (j/king) :P

  I looked at you game, from start to end, and I think some of you idea's were good.  But you didn't understand lots of black moves, so it came back to hurt you.  I will be commenting per move.  And on your comments ^_^".  If you have any question message me on kgs, EvilBuu.  All my comments will be preceeded by "*".]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[od]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[I wanted to take a more active approach than merely responding at A or B.

* not bad idea ^_^"  But this move says, you don't mind black playing C14, and taking away that corner for you.  You are saying you want influnce game.]
;B[mc];W[ne]LB[qc:A]TR[fc][mc]C[Because black's marked stones are both low, I decided to emphasize the outside with this joseki choice.    The pattern starting at A did not seem as attractive.

So far, this exact board pattern up to move 8 has appeared in a few pro games, so I doubt either side's moves can be faulted.  However, that doesn't mean I understand what white's strategy should be here, which could be what gets me in trouble.

*right on the "A" the joseki there would be troublesome.   So first better to run out into the center.  And the point of O15 again is influnce.  So far your stones are all influnce so it's good.  And black's all 3'rd line, thus cash!]
;B[jd]
(;W[df]LB[qf:A][pg:B]C[With B9 reinforcing the top, W10 seemed more urgent than attacking at A or B.

* Now this move is a contradictory to your move at P16, because you were willing to give that up, you shouldn't make another weak group.  First you should attack R15.  Look at the example starting at R15.]
;B[pf];W[qc]LB[ld:A][ph:B][qh:C]TR[pq]C[The variation that presses at A just helps black here, so i go for the corner instead.   Counter-attacks near B and C look like overplays because white has no presence on the right side, but maybe I'm wrong.   The  marked black stone at Q3 isn't high.

*This is a tough position, but playing R17 to make a sabaki is a good idea.  You get a base which is very important.]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[pd]LB[rb:A][re:B]C[This is the first move in the game that departs from joseki, and it's a bad one, pushing on a link.   Black's choices are typically A or B here.

*Actually this move is good here, b/c of N17.  It sets up for a wonderfull fellow up move at O17.  and if black gets to play S18 later on it's a big move, b/c it robs white of it's base ..]

(;W[ng]LB[rb:A][rd:B][qh:C]C[My judgement may be off here, but I don't want to get shut in.  I could have exchanged A for B in sente first, which would be more consistent with keeping the claim in the corner.

It's a vague move, but threatens a follow-up at C.  I don't know.  Maybe I could just tenuki here.

*So this is first area I disagree on with you.  I recommend A, because a base is very important for your stons or they become floating.  Which is not a good idea.  Look at example!]
;B[nc]C[I don't see that this peep gains black much.

*Well think of it what heppens if you don't answer it ^^" it's a forcing move :P Meant to take sente, while fixing his defects :D]
;W[oc];B[ph]
(;W[qn]LB[hc:B][qj:A]C[White's group in the upper right. far enough out that I'm not concerned.  I decide to loosely invade the right hand side.   This move aims at black's open skirt at A.   B (H17) is an alternative attack point.

*Not a good good idea, to play at R6, b/c you will not have any base if black makings a checking extention from above.  So you want to play a  move that has double meaning, a high approch will work better for you, because of your other stones, this stone is by it self, so it is calling for lots of help, and not getting any.  Please look at example for an example!]
;B[ql]C[Well, I didn't expect this pincer.   Maybe R6 wasn't too bright.]

(;W[np]LB[qq:A]C[I seem to dislike real territory in this game for some reason.   Attaching at A might be okay.

*This was too loose, a move at A could be bad, depending on your oppents understanding of the joseki,  B/c of the stones at Q12, the joseki starting at R3 would be way too nice for black.  So I recommend the squence in example ^_^"]
;B[qp];W[on];B[ol];W[kf]LB[lc:A]C[This group is getting a little weak.   I was also aiming at something near A but I wasn't really sure what.   However, this may be a bit aji keshi, because...

*This move doesn't really do any thing to black >_>.  and your group, although without any eyes, still not in danger.  Better to play C10.]
;B[if]LB[hc:A]C[Now the invasion at A isn't so promising.

* L14 proved that >_<.  But you can still invade at H17, lookat the example ^^"]

(;W[or]LB[ci:A]C[Probably bigger just to protect the left side at A.

*This move is generally considered bad, b/c it ends in gote.  Bette to play something more solid.]
;B[pr];W[oq];B[rr];W[jq];B[rb]C[Black removes my endgame move here.

*NO!, not end game, he removes your base. Now your white group is floating!.  You have to now make two eyes in center.  Most of the times this is VERY BAD!]
;W[kh];B[ch]C[This is a great move by black.]
(;W[bg]LB[ff:B][ck:A]C[This is a tough one.   The other common options, playing a pincer at A or running at B, didn't seem so good.

*B13 is to submissive ;_;.  You are willing saying please take me not mind ;_;  If you are going to defend defend activily.]
;B[cn]
(;W[cl]LB[dn:A]C[White may be able to attach at A instead to build a position that works with the moyo on the bottom.

*I don't like C8, because it casues your problems, best take profit on the bottom.  Because you are behind in space, better to play the joseki in example!]
;B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[el];W[cj];B[bh]
(;W[dm]LB[dh:A]C[It may have been better for me just to capture two black stones at A and insure white's safety.

* I don't see a move at "A" working.  But D7 is not a good move here .. you are hopping for a mistake ...  Instead of D7 try C6, a bit better, try to make sabaki]
;B[dn];W[em];B[fn]
(;W[ei]LB[dh:A]C[This allows black to escape too easily.  A is the point.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[eh];W[dh]C[This was a misclick, but my opponent responded so fast I didn't get a chance to ask for an undo!]
;B[dg];W[cf]LB[db:A][hc:B]C[At this point I'm not feeling so good about white's game.   The group in the upper left doesn't have as much chance of making territory in sente, although I suppose maybe White A still threatens B.

Also, we have a series of weak groups from both black and white on the left.   A this point I make the fateful conclusion that I must kill to win.

* Lets look at the score ...

Black:
Top 23 + Right 24 + BR 8, Total: 55

White:
TL 15 + Bottom 32, Total: 47

So looking at that playing A would be really nice, but at the same time you have two weak groups in center >< not good! So first work with them .. and then try to come back to A!]

;B[hh]
(;W[gh]LB[ge:A][dl:B][cm:C]C[This move doesn't accomplish much.   Maybe it was better for me to just extend into the region with A or play the big double sente point at B.   Later, black's atari at C becomes a big problem.

* ture not much, and gives black more >< Not a good excahnge, now your white group there is somewhat out of danger.  So better to come play D18 and save your group above.]
;B[gg]
(;W[hj]TR[fk][el][fm][cn][dn][en][fn][bp]C[I'm now targetting the marked black group for total death, rather than profit from attack.   Now, I'm not really good at this.

* Okie faire enough ^^" wrong direction to attack from thou :P You are going to drive black into your own space O.o Look at an example!  Mind you thats just one example, you can attack a group many ways and try to kill it!  Which I did, but at same time i kept pushing white's borders up little by little.  gain space while keeping black weak ^^"]

[dr][gr][ds]C[Black is obviously convinced that white's marked group is dead.  I looked at it for a while and agreed, and therefore resigned.

I think that by going for the big kill I missed the chance to profit from the attack and of course risked my own group.

**** Final Comments!

** Very good game to review ^_^"  There were some fun analysis to do in this game.  Remeber never give up a base ><.  That leads to problems, because you had a weak group at P17 and a weak group at C8, you couldn't attack C12 stones or the B3 stones. 

Lessons from game ...

1) Always lauch attack from base
2) Don't play moves like P2
3) Don't attach when attacking! (There are always expections, but in the game where u attached that was not good idea).
4) When black has a huge moyo, try to find a miai point to make a split attack.  Don't just go in blinded have a plan before you invade ^_^"
