;B[pd];W[cq];B[qp];W[dc]C[(thank you for the oportunity to review our game. I hope my suggestions are helpful and not too inaccurate)
so far, the fuseki is sound and played in numerous pro games.]
;B[oq]C[enclosing the 3-4 is one of the biggest moves. good.]
;W[de]C[white reponds appropriately.];B[dp]LB[pj:a][qj:b][jd:c]
[jc:d][cj:e]TR[pd][qp][oq]C[this does not appear to be correct. the 3-3 is solid... seems too soon to approach. Bigger moves should be considered. the marked points are good candidates. for example... "a" or "b" extends nicely from bottom right and also relates to Q16.]
;W[cp]C[white is now getting stronger.];B[do];W[er];B[jd]C[s: I guess I should have finished the joseki in the bottom left. f3? 
-there are other choices. I agree that 3 versus 2 stones in the bottom left is not comfortable. since you were intending on invading at C13 in a few moves, maybe something like C6? It is tough to determine which joseki to play based on whole board position.]
;W[qj]C[...one of the vital points mentioned earlier. It would be nice if this were a black stone.]
;B[cg]C[seems too soon. marked stones are floating / have no base. white might pincer to split two weak groups,]
(;W[qf]TR[do][dp];B[nd]TR[nc]LB[qh:a]C[many options here. Even the split at "a" has been played by pros.... if you are up for a fight.]
;W[hc]C[this is small move by white. black rightfully tenuki'ed. however....  don't forget to look for BIGGEST open areas in the opening / fueki stage.... C13 could use some support (base).]
;B[rd];W[qm];B[qh]C[yes. punish connection problem.];W[og];B[rf]
C[nice way to try to save the stone.... still much bigger open areas though. think about purpose of C13 adn D5,D6 in our overall plan and board position ( fuseki).]
;W[qg];B[rg];W[ph];B[qi];W[pj];B[jq]C[s: At this point I felt pretty confident I was in a good position. However, a move on the left was more urgent as I have two weak groups there. c16 or c9 or so would have left me more stable.

I agree that left is HUGE. The move you played was not sente. TRY to make sente as much as you can. The book " How not to play go" stresses that we kyu players grossly underestimate the value and fun of plaing sente moves.]
;W[cf]C[whit secures big corner and puts pressure on black,]
(;B[dg]C[this looks like too easy of a target for white to attack.]
;W[dk]C[s: Now I get punished...];B[cj];W[hp];B[ck];W[cm]TR[dk]
C[now black needs to punish white tenuki - D9 is short of liberties. you were right to attack. your attack should result in making opponent weaker, not stronger. By contacting weak stone, you can make it stronger. Or ou can also try to severe the connection.]
(;B[dj]C[this seems to make weak stone stronger.];W[dl]
(;B[jo]TR[do][dp]C[now two marked stones are in serious trouble.]
;W[hn];B[fj]MA[fm][gn]C[this hurts inside group. MAybe try to save  or reduce. along marked boundary line?]
;W[mq]TR[do][dp];B[no];W[mo];B[mn];W[ln];B[mp];W[lo];B[lp];W[kp]
;B[kq];W[np];B[lq];W[nn];B[oo];W[mm];B[ko]C[s: That was a good sequence for me, but now I should have tenukied. Maybe it still was not too late to help the d5 group.

it was a good save BUT it also took away some possibilities of splitting two white groups on right side.  your top right side still is wide open as well. K18 closes the door and makes F17 vunerable to invasion. Try to find dual-purpose moves if possible.]
;W[on];B[po]C[gote.];W[ld];B[lc];W[mc];B[md];W[kc];B[lb];W[kd]
;B[mb]C[seek sente. the sente points will add up to our favor.]
;W[gf]
(;B[kb]C[s: aji keshi?
yes... preserve aji ... seek bigger sente.];W[jc];B[mf];W[lh]
C[white got stronger in center];B[kf];W[mg];B[nf]C[this gote finish is costly.]
;W[gl];B[ed]C[s: This is already quite desperate but I managed to live.
m. I like this fighting spirit. It is good that you lived. try to apply same principle wehn you are ina position of strength. Yilun Yang told me once in a workshop that I "taking care of myself" after I was "already sick". the fitness metaphor is useful. get healthy groups/position... then attack from strength.]

C[White: 69 territories + 8 prisoners + 2.0 komi = 79

Result: W+3

m- I hope some of the feedback was helpful. A few  points: to consider: look for and play biggest moves in opening. try not to contact opponent's weak stones to make them stronger, make stronger groups first then go for the killer attacks ( which you showed that you are a very good fighter)... and SENTE .

If something is not clear or totally crazy, please feel free to drop me a note.
