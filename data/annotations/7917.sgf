Hello, dear reviewer!

Thank you for every idea how to improve my game.
I tried to describe a few problems i had during the game (the few i realize for myself! :-), maybe you have some ideas for me, what to do in these situations. specially the one, where i thought about 10 mins...
thank you in advance for every comment and concept from your side!

greetings, Duumvir (on KGS)

mw: Hi Duumvir, I've added some comments where something came to mind.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[cf];W[fd];B[dj]
(;W[jq]C[here i wanted to avoid the same move from b, forming a impressing wing - is this a good plan?

mw: i think that's a good idea. but did you find the right spot? see variations]
;B[lq];W[gq];B[eq]C[but im getting quite fast under pressure, and b is building much territory on the left while attacking w]
;W[fo]C[mw: the two-space extension is safe enough for now. this exchange doesn't turn out good for you. it solidifies black's left side too much.]
;B[eo];W[fn];B[en];W[qn]C[here it wanted to use my inflluence of the w k3 group and make pressure on the b m3 stone

mw: i think you could have tried this move without the F5 E5 exchange]
;B[kc];W[nq]C[the continuing of my plan - is it a good idea to attack here?

mw: it's something i might try. but a calm move would be Q10. black would have to decide between preventing the shimari around P17 and defending his bottom right formation]
;B[np]
(;W[mq]C[is it the right continuation for the attack?

mw: see the variation];B[mp];W[lr];B[lp];W[oq];B[op];W[pq];B[kr]
C[mw: black should compete for the corner here.];W[mr];B[kq]
(;W[qp];B[jp];W[iq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fm]
(;W[ip]C[mw: careful with moves like this. it's called "pushing from behind" and you do it several times in this game. it's a move that forces the opponent to stay one step ahead of you, so in the end it does more for him than for you. see variation]
;B[jo];W[jr]C[mw: i don't think this is good. it's not sente. see variation]
(;B[ks];W[hn];B[jm];W[gm]C[w is feeling quite uncomfortable now... getting under pressure from two sides, b building even more territory. but where has been my fault?

mw: next time, try to find a lighter way of jumping out. like leaving out the F5 exchange, J5 instead of J4, and here H8 instead of G7 (not such a big difference though)]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[io];W[ho];B[fk];W[qk];B[hc];W[gc];B[hd];W[cd]
;B[od];W[pf];B[qc];W[rc];B[pc]
(;W[ng]C[is this move too greedy? i cant defend the invasion later on, so it must be! :-)

mw: it's a bit of a strange move. it doesn't defend the right properly, isn't attacking anything. at this point white needed a plan. there are the black stones at the bottom, which can't really be killed, but a profitable attack seems possible. there's a gap between L3 and P4 which can be targeted, and also between C14 and D10. see variation]
;B[pi];W[nj]C[is this the correct answer? what is a good plan here for w?

mw: maybe it should have been P9 or P10, to avoid black strengthening himself with the attach move next]
;B[pk];W[pl];B[ok];W[ol]C[here i thought it is a good idea to attack the b l1 group while attacking the b q9 group

mw: that's ok. but it's a pity that in this sequence you are again pushing from behind. black's stones on the right get stronger.]

(;W[kg]C[for this move i thought about 10 min, but still i dont think, that it is the best one in this situation. but which one is best? (thank you!)

mw: see variation];B[lg];W[lf];B[mh];W[nh];B[kh];W[jg];B[jh]
(;W[ih]C[should have been the move in the variation, right?

mw: i like this move better];B[ig];W[mg];B[lh]C[mw: this sequence has turned out well for you. if you defend a cut now, for instance at L15, black is forced to crawl out at J11, and you can tear up the top. you also get pushed into his left side. points-wise you have in total about as much as black has on the left, so there's still a chance of winning if you can heavily reduce the top and also get a move in around C12.]
;W[ii];B[kf]C[here i saw, that this would be very unpleasant for w, but i didnt know what to do else here? how to utilize the w stones, do you have an idea for me?

mw: not really. the cut is devastating, white has to make a plan a few moves earlier. (this was the last comment)]
