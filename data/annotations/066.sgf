This is one of those really difficult type of questions -- I really don't
know the answer, I can only give my feelings.

First, I think one of your own shimaris, probably the UR one, is bigger than
this kakari.

As to worries about the pincer reducing the value of your shimari, should
you kakari on the lower left -- this shouldn't be a worry.  If he pincers,
make a counter-pincer that also happens to be an extension from your shimari.
In fact, you should be happy with this, as it gives you a chance to extend.
If he doesn't pincer -- then you get influence extending towards your shimari,
either way, you should be happy.];W[df];B[fe];W[dh];B[po];W[ec]C[> Should W keep acting in this corner?


This is not totally unreasonable at this point -- it is a fairly big point, and

it is also close to sente -- though with a proper response, I think white loses
on the exchange.  There are definitely better things for white to be doing,  K3 stands out to me, as does R10.]
;B[fb]C[I don't like this -- it does little to get the black group eye space, and really just

makes it heavy.  If white follows up with a pincer around J17, black could be looking

very bad.  I would prefer an extension up the side for black, probably J16.  White may

end up capturing one of the F17/F15 stones, but black will get more than enough  compensation along the top side.]
;W[eb]C[Ick.  Why?  This is about an 8 point end-game move.  It does make the pincer on the

black group more severe -- but black should take an extension from the group immediately.

A play at K16 would be very nice now -- settles this group, and makes E18 look very
bad.];B[jp]C[A big point -- but the extension to K16 is more important.  A white play there would
make black uncomfortable.];W[fa]C[> Again, should W be doing this?  It seems he's playing endgame stuff  > and letting me take big points.


This move is very bad -- it encourages the potentially heavy black stones at F17

to start making eye shape.  Not a good idea -- it makes them far harder to attack.

White is making the black group thick in order to gain a couple points of territory.

He has given up more on the side with this move than he has gained in the corner.]
;B[ga];W[ea];B[hb]C[The hanging connection is, of course, correct in this situation -- because at this
point eye shape looks to be far more important than reducing ko threats.]
;W[od]C[This might be a lot more worrisome, if white hadn't already solidified black at the UL.]
;B[pf]C[> A 1 kyu in Paolo Alto said this type of move ( I played something  > similar in Handicap game) is non-standard and may be inviting a whit  > invasion below it.  What do you think?

In a handicap game, the corner stone was probably on the 4th line, and the  
knight's move up to the 5th line.  In that case, it does allow for an invasion,
but it still isn't entirely unreasonable.


In this case, I don't think the invasion underneath is a problem -- the 3,4 stone
makes that more difficult.


But, I still don't think it is the right move for black -- in this situation, black

has thickness to the left, the move that stands out to me is a pincer of the white

stone, while simultaneously making the extension.  In the opening, if you can find

a move that simultaneously does two things, it is very often a good move.  (Usually

this is pincer & extension -- though it can be extension&extension, or extension and

kakari.  An extension and extension example is the third stone of the san-ren-sai,
which is an extension from both corner stones.)

So I would play a move around M16 myself.


(I'm not saying this response to the kakari is inherently bad, just that there is

a better response here because of the surrounding situation.  In general, it looks

like a reasonable response to this kakari.  The best way to check this is to find

a joseki book that discusses 3/4 josekis, and look to see if this is shown as a
resonse to the kakari in question.  I think it will be.)];W[qc];B[ne]C[>Influence rather than corner?  My wall on left seems to make this  >idea a good one.

It is a good idea -- but too late.  Once you've resonded at Q14, you seem
to have given up on taking influence towards your wall, in favour of influence
towards the right side.  Also, this is just doesn't look like it works with  your wall on the left.

More normal, I think, is S17, Q17, S15, then white makes an extension along
the upper side.  Of course, this "normal" sequence is part of the reason that
black probably doesn't want to make the Q14 response initially -- it doesn't
work well with his stones at F17.

O15 just doesn't seem to work well with anything, and the shape looks wrong.]
;W[rd];B[re]C[This feels a little wrong -- a bit of an overplay.  I think the more solid R15 is
better -- especially after playing O15.   I've added the variation to show how

I think white should respond (R15 instead of Q16), as an illustration of why I
feel S15 is not the best choice.]
(;W[pd]C[As noted, this should be at R15.];B[qe];W[rc]C[Small, should probably be at N17.]
;B[nd]C[Important -- this is a nice move.];W[nc];B[mc];W[nb];B[mb]C[And, amazingly, black gets just the outside wall, facing the way he wanted, that he

was looking for.  I wish white was this accomdating whenever I play black. :-)]
;W[ma]C[End-game.  At least's its sente end game -- though, at this point, it is probably worth

it for black to ignore -- the kakari at F3 is worth more, and an extension to somewhere
around Q9/R9 would definitely be much larger.];B[la];W[na];B[lb];W[se];B
[sf];W[sd];B[rg]C[> White resolved the corner completely.  Is this generally a good way  > to play?  It seems to remove the danger from this part of the board, which  > may lose opportunity if danger needed later.

This is not a good way to play,  white totally removes any of the "threat to
connect" aji available here -- that could help make an invastion of the left
side (or top) live.   As I've already mentioned -- I think black should have
taken some other point rather than respond at the top -- though I think the
extra thickness along the side was probably worth responding to.];W[qm]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[pj]C[I think I'd have chosen the low pincer here -- either R10 or R9.  You can probably play
the one point pincer successfully because of your great thickness at the top.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[oo];B[op];W[no];B[np]C[This would be better at N4 -- the stone at Q3 covers against a white push and

cut at O4, and this moves you ahead of white in the run along the side.  Being the

one step ahead, removes your later worries about the stone at K4 getting cut off.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[mo];B[mp]C[>would action at top like o9 be better here?  I fear I may lose  >connection with k4 if I allow hane at bottom.

Yes, O9 would probably be better.  Or, if you are going to play on this
side, the jump to M4 would be better than N4.  The worry about K4 being
cut off is minor -- it has lots of room -- either a one point jump into
the centre, or an extension along the side to G3, or even F3 all work
well.];W[nj]C[This looks like an overplay -- white should extend one more before he attempts a  hane.]
;B[ni]C[Black should cut at O9 here, rather than replying how white wants him to.  Black has

lots of thickness around, so he should cut aggressively.  If black cuts, white will

likely atari at O8 and things look good for black.  Of course, white may atari at   N9 -- but the variations all look good for black -- primarily because the threat of
atari and capture on the P9 stone as a second method of connection.];W[mj]
;B[mi];W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[kh]C[The hane at M10 is better -- it puts more pressure on the white group.  But the white group

is now alive, since it can capture the stone at R9.  Still, I prefer M10 to L12.


Of course, better than both would be a play at F13 or F12 -- White can't get very far

into blacks moyo on this side -- but he can dig a lot deeper from the other direction.]
;W[gg]C[A nice play, reduces nicely, without being an overplay.];B[fg]C
[> I tried to cut this off rather than allow the penetration.  WHen is   > that a good idea?  Here, g13 seems too far from support, so I try to cut and  > kill.

This stone should not be cuttable -- this shape is actually considerred quite
solid, and quite good.  One point farther, and you might have had a shot at  cutting.  This is why L12 should have been played near hear.

These decision of cut vs block are always difficult -- sometimes one starts
to cut, in an effort to build thickness for a counter invasion, sometimes one
just plays elsewhere, because any local move is now too small.  At this point,
I think the choices are H14 (to block) or on of C6/F3.];W[fh];B[gf];W[hg]
;B[hf];W[ig];B[jf]C[> so, it didn't really work, but perhaps it lessoned the damage of  > invasion?  I don't know about f13 and moves like it.

It didn't change things much -- compared to a simple blocking play at H14.]

White's thickness and influence is as valuable, or even more so, than the
black territory.  Black should be looking at a move around C6 to reduce this,
instead of attacking a live white group.];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk]
;B[lk]C[Left side is bigger -- this is an endgame move.];W[cl]C[This move should be closer to the corner,  here it is too close to the white thickness.

The corner stone is weaker than the white wall, so the extra stone should be closer.
In fact, D6 would be a nice point for white, as would be F4, G4, or H4.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[gq]C[I think with the K4 stone, you can play G5 here instead of G3.]
;W[go];B[ho];W[hn];B[in];W[im]C[White can't afford to do this -- he should play J5 first, black will atari, then he can

[jm];B[jn];W[gm];B[hl];W[jl];B[ij];W[kn]C[This would be better at M7, connecting to life.  Of course, white probably expects
black to connect, avoiding the double atari.];B[km];W[io]C[>Is it dangerous to leave these cuts?  I felt okay with k4, in place, but I  >wonder if I play too loose

In this case, I think you made the right choice -- this cut doesn't go very
far, but the cut you make is valuable.];B[jo];W[hp];B[hq];W[lm]C[White is probably better off playing L8 here, and driving through a connection.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[jk];W[lo];B[lp];W[mk]C[This is small gote for white -- there are bigger moves, including E4, G8, or G9.]

The push here is a good idea -- even the push and cut, but your followup isn't
correct.  Normally, you can cut some white stones, depending on the situation,
but white has gotten some extra plays in, and that effects things.


The score on the board right now is VERY close -- by a quick count I got 107 for
black and 105 for white -- without counting any komi -- so correct endgame is
important.  Black would seem to have more end-game moves available than white,
though.];W[eo];B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[dr];W[cr]C[> Here's my first chance to straighten this out.  Stop this silly  > invasion and lock down with e2.


Up to this point it has been fine, even correct -- and hasn't cost you anything.  What

is nice, is this sequence has made the connect at E2 sente.  So make the connection in

sente.  Then a jump in at F9 is good -- this jump also takes advantage of the aji from

the stones at D6 -- white may not be able to fight back quite so aggressively.  Variation
1 shows a likely sequence.]

C[White should ignore this -- a further extension to K1 is bigger.  So, instead, black

;W[ho];B[hr];W[gs];B[fr]C[>I bet j2 or k2 is better than this, right?


Actually, the proper move is the throw-in at F1.  This reduces the liberties on the

white stones by one, then the hane at J1 is atari.  After F1, white plays F2 (atari),

then black plays J1 (atari), white plays G2 (connection) and black goes back and connects

at J2 or K2.  This throw in is often the solution to properly dealing with monkey-jumps.]
