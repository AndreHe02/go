;W[qh]C[reid:  Personally, I like this joseki for white.  But it's
usually used when white wants to build thickness on the outside
(black usually goes into the corner at r17 next) and it's not
real clear that thickness is going to be valuable for white in
this game.  But it's probably playable.];B[of];W[qc];B[qj];W[pj]LB[pi:a]
C[reid: If white wants to keep black split (which seems like a good idea)
then probably a (q11) would be a better move.];B[qi];W[pi]LB[ph:a]C[reid:  Difficult choice for white now.  He might want to come
out with a (q12) but it's painful to let black come through at
q11.  On the other hand, the black cut at a (q12) next is painful
too.  Nonetheless, I think I'd play at a (q12) instead of q11.];B[ph];W
[qk];B[rh];W[rj];B[ri];W[oh];B[pg];W[pl]LB[jp:a]C[reid:  the left side has equal black and white stones.  on the
right, black has 10 points and life already, plus the lower right
corner at q4.  the white stones at q16 *might* be worth about 10
points, but the r9 group is worth almost nothing.  it could even
become a burden.  so it looks like black can just take a nice
big point and see what happens.  I'd probably take a (k4) next.];B[qm]C
[reid:  this is too early and too greedy for black.  there
is no real chance of killing this white group, so black
shouldn't even try.  Trying to kill it runs the risk of
amari-gatachi (over-developed attacking shape).   
black doesn't need to play this side at all since if white approaches
normally at r6 (for example) he will be over-concentrated.];W[rl];B[qn]
LB[jp:a]C[reid: now black is over-concentrated instead.  again, better to
play at a (k4).

for another way to look at this, see variation 1.]
(;W[nq];B[np]LB[pq:a]C[reid:  "when you touch me, you help me."  the contact play allows
white to settle his shape easily.  I think simply playing at a (q3)
would be more difficult for white to deal with.];W[mp];B[no]LB[oq:a]C[reid:  black's shape here is awkward.  The relationship between o5
and the stones at r6 is not very efficiant.  This would be a good time
for black to play the joseki with a (p3) instead.];W[qq]LB[oq:a]C[reid:  white doesn't want black to get anything!  this is too greedy.
normal for white would be a (p3).  since white has s8 in place, he
doesn't need to be too concerned with black getting a large corner.];B[pq]
LB[oq:a][lq:b][rr:c][so:d]C[reid:  I think black a (p3) would be better.  at this point, white could
play something like b (m3) to make shape on the outside and leave the
corner aji for later.  a move like white c (s2) probably lives in the corner.
plus white always has the monkey jump to d (t5).];W[pr]C[reid:  living in the corner in exchange for black getting thickness
on the outside is probably not a good strategy for white since the
stones at q10 aren't settled yet.];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[rn]LB[qo:a]
[rp:b][jp:c]C[reid: black a (r5) instead of s6 would be sente and better shape.
white would probably pull back to s4, so white's connection is still
not secure.  after white b (s4), something like black c (k4) looks
very nice.];W[qo];B[po];W[qp];B[mo];W[om];B[on];W[pm];B[pn]LB[gp:a]C[reid: saving these stones is only worth about 10-12 points in gote.  something
like a (g4) instead would set up a nice moyo for black.];W[fq]C[reid: this looks like the right direction to nulify black's thickness
from a safe distance.];B[hq]LB[eq:a][fp:b][dn:c][jq:d]C[reid:  with this move, black is taking territory with his thickness.  but
trying to push white into the wall with black a (e3) white b (f4), black
c (d6) white d (k6) doesn't look very attractive either.  difficult position
for black.];W[hp];B[ip];W[gp];B[jq]C[reid: black is seriously over-concentrated now.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[em];W[hn]LB[dl:a][dr:b]C[reid:  this move gives white two unsettled groups which is often
a recipe for a lost game.  white might want to consider playing
a (d8) instead.  if black surrounds the three stones, white still
has moves at b (d2) and probably lots of aji around h6 to keep this
area small.];B[gl]C[reid: this looks like a good attack.];W[hl];B[hk];W
[il];B[ml];W[ik];B[hj];W[ji];B[ni];W[oi];B[nh];W[nj];B[mj];W[mi];B[nk];W
[ng];B[mh];W[mg];B[li]LB[lh:a]C[reid:  taking this stone might feel natural, but since black also
has miai taking white o10, it would be better to just extend to a (m12).]
;W[lh];B[oj];W[og];B[kh];W[lg];B[ij]LB[ki:a][jj:b]C[reid: simply connecting at a (l11) looks better.  then black can
aim to cut across the knights move with b (k10) instead of pushing  into it with j10.]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[io]C[reid: ouch!  black really wanted this move :-)];B[jl]
C[reid: hmmm, even if white ends up capturing k9, I think black wants
to play k5 now.  it makes a large territorial difference.];W[jp];B[iq];W
[jm];B[km];W[kp];B[lq];W[gm];B[fm];W[fn];B[dn]LB[fo:a][go:b][jn:c]C[reid: if black wants to keep the pressure on white, this move
has to be at a (f5).  if white responds with b (g5), black c (k6)
looks like a serious threat.];W[lp];B[mq];W[jn];B[cm];W[bn];B[fc]LB[df:a]
C[reid: this looks like the wrong direction.  black a (d14) would
start building a nice moyo for black.];W[cg]C[reid: white's natural response here makes it impossible for black
to get much value out of his wall.];B[di]C[reid: too over-concentrated.]
;W[bm]LB[dc:a]C[reid:  this is too small.  black is under-cut on both sides, so white
doesn't need to rush to take either side (b7 or b11).  instead, i white
might want to think about re-enforcing the corner with a (d17) or attacking
the lone stone at f17.];B[cl];W[hh];B[gi];W[pe];B[pf];W[jg];B[ki]C[reid: all these moves seem smaller than something on the top side.  the
two stones at k11 are not very important since they seperate two living
groups.];W[kg];B[lc];W[ic]LB[jc:a]C[reid: this is natural for white, so perhaps black should have held back a bit.
perhaps a (k17) would have been better than m17.];B[le];W[nf];B[nb];W[kd]
;B[oe];W[od];B[ne];W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[cd];W[cc];B[dc];W[de];B[cb];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[ec];B[db];W[ed];B[eb];W[bd];B[jh];W[ke];B[ok];W[pk];B[rc];W[rb]
;B[qd]LB[pb:a][qb:b]C[reid:  white seems to be a little bit ahead on the board, so black
needs to try something.  what happens of black plays a (q18) instead
of forcing white to patch up his weakness with r16?  lots of complications
could arise (which is what black wants when he's behind).  safer for white
would have been b (r18) instead of s18.];W[pb];B[ch];W[bh];B[dg];W[bg];B
[dr];W[cr];B[bi];W[df];B[eg];W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[bk];W[kn];B[cs];W[bs];B
[ds];W[br];B[gq];W[kq];B[kr];W[lr];B[mr];W[jr];B[ls];W[ir]LB[fr:a]C[reid: it almost works :-)  clearly this should be at a (f2) instead.]
;B[gr];W[fr];B[fs];W[fo];B[hb]LB[gc:a]C[reid: white really wanted to clamp at a (g17) before black gets
back to here.  the clamp would be sente (threatening to kill the
corner) so by rights, this should have been white's.];W[ib];B[lm];W[hc]
;B[gb];W[fh];B[gh];W[ih]C[reid: white is contradicting himself here.  if he wants f12, he should save
f12.  if he wants to save h12 (and possibly k11) he should play to save
them.  white may *want* both, but it's not reasonable to expect to *get* both.]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[gf];W[fg];B[hf];W[ff];B[ig];W[fd]LB[fi:a]C[reid: is this necessary?  why can't white push in with a (f11), etc?]
;B[ia];W[gc];B[fb];W[ja];B[ha];W[kb];B[fi];W[ei]C[reid: does this work?]
;B[eh];W[cj];B[dj];W[bj]C[reid: yes, there's something here.];B[ak];W[ci]
;B[dh];W[ck];B[dk];W[bi];B[bl];W[qe];B[re];W[ln];B[sj];W[rk];B[lo];W[mm]

LB[ar:a]C[reid: this give black one more ko threat, no?  a (a2) instead of a3 wouldn't.]
;B[am];W[dl];B[ek];W[al];B[bq];W[ar];B[am];W[sf];B[rf];W[al];B[fk];W[am]
;B[sm];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[reid:  a good game.  looks like both black and white have good fighting ability.
but it seems that both would benefit from working a bit more on finding the
biggest points and the right directions of play in the early parts of the game.]

(;AE[qm]LB[qm:a]N[var 1]C[reid:  if the shape is like this, does black want to play a gote
move at a (r7)?]))
