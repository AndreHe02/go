AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][pj][dj][jp][jd][jj]C[I haven't played that many large handicap games, so I'd appreciate any comments on how I should have used the large advantage I started with.

Also, I consider one of my primary issues right now a lack of knowing where the 'big points' are and seeing the overall picture, so any comments in that area would be appreciated.

n - Here I would insert a general reaction: "You need to play more defensively, solidifying your stones rather than attacking.  I guess the most important thing is to learn to recognize a group in danger, either yours on the opponent's."]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[ke]LB[oc:a][pc:b]C[I'm not quite sure about this move.  It looks a bit unnecessarily agressive.  Maybe F16-17 instead to use the thickness of K16-17

It is not so much agressive, as ineffective.  You will notice that white ignored it!  Indeed, F16-17 would be good moves.  If you wanted to attack the white group, maybe P17 would work better, as well as securing the corner.

n - W ignored it, but it's a very good move, and a black move at A or B would pretty much win the game at this point, even if W lived.  W could not afford to ignore this move.]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[dm];B[cj]C[n - Good move.];W[gj];B[eh]C[I was not sure how to handle G10.  Would F12 have been better?

No, I think this is the better move.  The one-point diagonal jump is too cuttable.  Maybe C13 is even better, as it ensures that the group at C10 will not be isolated.]
;W[ef];B[fd]C[Good move];W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go]C[Weak move, too easy to cut F4 and F5 apart.]
;W[hp];B[fn]C[Well, as you saw, this was a bad move.  F5 or E4 would have been better.]
;W[ep]
(;B[fo]C[Leery of getting in a ko-fight this soon, thinking that I didn't have many ko-threats, whereas my large moyo gave an endless number for W.

I don't agree (see variation).];W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[dn];W[dq]
;B[co];W[cp];B[cn]C[Now you have given up a lot of corner territory.

n - on the other hand, the W stones in the middle are almost dead.]
;W[ek]
(;B[fl]TR[dm][ek]SQ[dl][el]LB[cl:a][bl:b]C[In retrospect, C8 or C12 seems urgent now, and for the next 20 moves or so...

Indeed!  You definitely want to  connect those two middle stones.  In this situation, you must recognize the white shape marked with triangles (hope you can see them, points D7 and E9) as a cuttable shape (called a "keima").  The proverb says "strike at the waist of a keima" (marked in squares) [D8 and E8\].  In this position, I would say that the variation looks OK.  (IMHO, but I am frequently dead wrong!)

n - You are missing the point.  The W stones are useless and almost dead if B connects at 'a' or 'b'.  B is so far ahead that only suicide can lose him the game.]
;W[el];B[fj]TR[dj][fj][fl]SQ[ek]C[Very bad shape at D10,F10,F8 (triangles) when white has E9 (square) as white has cutting points in abundance.]
;W[fk]C[As seen on TV.];B[ej];W[gl];B[fm]TR[fl]SQ[bl]C[Now both of your groups look heavy. Better to abandon your stone at F8 (triangle) and connect below (square).  But then, in retrospect, you know that already ;)]
;W[il];B[im]LB[gi:a]C[This move seems strange.  Are you laboring under the illusion that you have a realistic chance of killing the white group in the center?  When playing handicap games, remember that you opponent will be harder to kill than you expect!   If I were you, in this situation, I would be more worried about the health of the groups surrounding the white group.

n - Right.  Also note that after connecting around B8, a black move at 'a' would be another game winner.]
;W[gh];B[gi]SQ[fg][cg]TR[fj][ej][dj][cj][eh]MA[fi]LB[cg:a][fg:b]
C[Rather F13 or C13? (squares)  It seems clear that you have realized that your group at D10 (triangles) is in trouble, but your latest move was not a good idea, considering the cut at F11 (X)  The reason I chose the two options shown was (b) the one-point diagonal jump that is nice to cut, and (a) a good opportunity to connect to your group at the top LH side.]
;W[hi]C[OK, so white attacks on the outside.  Probably better.]
;B[fi];W[ij];B[hm];W[jl];B[hl]LB[hk:A]C[Not a very productive move, as white connects easily at A.  After the exchange, all you have is one less liberty.]
;W[hk];B[ih]SQ[bl][cg][fg][np][je]TR[nq][pn][qn][oc][pc][qj]
C[Intent here was to thwart W from forming a double tiger's mouth. In retrospect, I'm not sure whether this was a big enough play at this point.

Erm, not quite up on that terminology.  Either way, I think you would be better served to play one of the marked moves. (Security: Squares, Territory: triangles).

n - only a move around B8 makes any sense.];W[hh];B[ii]SQ[ej]
[dj][cj][fj][fi][gi][eh]TR[co][cn][dn][en][fn][fm][fl][fo][fp]
[go][hm][hl][im]C[I think you are -very- ambitious if you plan to kill this group.  The stones you just played are vulnerable and the group at D10 (squares) is still weak, as is the one at F5 (triangles).  Furthermore, the white group has lots of places to run to.]
;W[gf];B[if];W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[Maybe P3?  You should be able to get white's invading stone seriously worried, chase it around a bit, and make secure territory. (variation)

n - I disagree, since this could cause a complex fight...B still just needs to play B8.]
;W[no];B[lq];W[kn];B[jn];W[km]C[Notice that the white group you were trying to kill earlier has successfully run out.]
;B[lo]C[This is rather bad shape, and I doubt whether you could successfully cut the white groups apart.  Better to see his last move as gote, and play some or other move to conserve your lead (yes, you are still ahead here!)]
;W[ko];B[jo];W[kp];B[kq];W[lp];B[mq]C[This move does not accomplish much, as white's next move is obvious.]
;W[mp];B[nr]C[Maybe P3 instead?];W[oq];B[pq];W[or];B[ms];W[ql]
;B[on];W[ol];B[nj];W[ml];B[lj]C[Nice territory grab here, but there are still risks from above and the right side.]

[pc]MA[qj][rj]C[OK, so you can't save your group anymore.  How about something like N15 or N16? (triangles) or maybe Q17 or P17? (squares)  R10 or S10 also look OK (X)]

I agree.];W[ld]
(;B[me]SQ[qb]C[Very small move!! You had already made a bamboo joint with your earilier "timid" move.  Now you should have exploited that secure connection by ignoring his threat to take one little stone. Better to focus on your group in the corner.R18 (square) maybe?  L18 might have been fun.

;W[nm];B[pn];W[em];B[jr];W[is]SQ[jb]TR[ha]C[Now K18 (square) looks big, to avert the monkey-jump at H19 (triangle).]
;B[hg];W[gg];B[fe];W[cc]C[Since I ended up answering each stone of W's invasion, he didn't lose any points.  Was there a way I could've killed it with less effort and came out ahead?

Hmm, I'll take a look, but in this situation you don't take a 3-3 point invasion lightly.]
