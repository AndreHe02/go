;B[pd]C[Thank you very much for taking the time to review this game. I accepted this challange from a higher ranked opponent, but ended up resigning early on without much insight into what had gone wrong. Hopefully you can help me understand the situation better.
  -Meekohi

Fernobob: I'll try.];W[jj];B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[cn];B[co]TR[dj]
C[Fernobob: This is a bit of an overplay. It works very well when there is a stone on or near the triangled point to stop white from making a base but doesn't work so well without as white can settle easily and blacks corner is still not quite secure (see variations).]
;W[dn]
(;B[gq]LB[pp:A]TR[fp]C[Fernobob: The triangled point is more normal as it is more open and thus more easily developeable over the bottom. Your move is acceptable though, especially when A is not there.]
;W[ci];B[de]C[Fernobob: This is the high approach and is absolutely correct.]
;W[cd];B[ce]LB[ce:A][de:B]C[Meekohi: This seemed alright, but maybe E16 would have prevent later problems?

This is alright but probably not best. The result is the same as if black had approached with A, then extended with B, which would have happened had he made the low approach. This is not so good for black as in the situation the high approach was correct and the low approach would have been less good.

As for a better move, I don't think whites move is reasonable and so it probably hasn't been researched much. E 16 or 17 look good to seal white in and run for the center though.]
;W[ed];B[bd];W[bc];B[dd];W[cc]C[This sequence of moves was only worth a few points whch were essentially blacks anyway but has lost a liberty and solidified whites position. Typically you shouldn't play any moves as small as this until near the end of the game when they are the most valuable points on the board.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[fd];W[ec];B[ff];W[ge]C[Fernobob: This sequence is very bad for black as it allows white to defend all of his weaknesses while]
;B[eg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh];W[hh];B[mc]LB[pj:A][lq:B]C[Meekohi: I wanted to prevent white from grabbing too much of the top, but maybe was not aggresive enough.

Fernobob: This is actually maybe too aggressive. It prevents white from getting too much on top but you don't really need to worry about that as you're well ahead and should instead play a more defensive move such as A or B to make a nice territory.]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[ej];B[di]C[I wasted too much time on this tiny group, this move probably wasn't important to keep it alive.

Fernobob: Yep];W[dj];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg];B[qj];W[kc];B[nq]
;W[jq];B[kp]LB[ip:A][kr:B]TR[jo]C[Fernobob: This is good, though then there is no stone at A or B, the triangled point is usually better.]
;W[fq]TR[gp]C[Meekohi: Up until this move I still felt very good about the game. I had no idea how to react to this invasion.

Fernobob: You are well ahead and this invasion is unreasonable. It might live, but if you play at the triangled point, cutting it off from the other white stone, both stones are very weak and chances are at least one will die.]
;B[fp];W[eq];B[ep];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[dq];W[iq]C[Fernobob: It would be hard to forsee this happening but it's a fairly common pattern so watch out for it.]

(;B[ip]LB[io:B][hp:A]C[This stone actually does nothing. it doesn't seal white in  because of the weakness at A and doesn't defend anything. If you want to stop white, the cap at B is probably better. (See variations).]
;W[jp];B[io]LB[hp:A]TR[ip]C[This move is actually unnecessary as it defends against the double atari at A, but you don't need to worry about the double atari as you can just sacrifice the triangled stone as it was doing nothing.]
;W[jo];B[in];W[ro];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[qm]LB[rq:A]C[You should have defended at A before making this attack. I think there might be some proverb about it which boils down to defending local weaknesses before attacking on a large scale.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[sp];B[pr];W[po];B[op];W[qh]TR[po][qo][ro][qp]
[sp][rq]C[Black has two weak groups now (triangled). They are maybe too far apart for you to attack both at once and so the correct technique is usually to chase them into each other, then split them apart when they are close. According to 'Attack and Defense', which incidentally is an excellent book, this is often one of the most devastating manouvres in the game.]
;B[qf]LB[nn:A]TR[qj][qm]C[This drives the white stone to attack the triangled stones. Nevertheless, it may still be a good move as it does drive the white stone about but it may be better to chase the less mobile group with A.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[rn]LB[on:A]TR[oh][ph][qh]C[This looks ugly.it defends your eyespace a bit but you could make this unnecessary by running to the centre with A, which would also indirectly attack the triangled stones.]
;W[on];B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[no];B[oo]C[Meekohi: Useless move in hindsight

I quite like it actually. It's sente and stops white playing there to make very nice shape.]
;W[pm];B[pl];W[pn];B[ld]C[Meekohi: Taking a wider look at the board, I was becoming worried about white closing off the top-center entirely.

As previously said, you don't need to worry about this. It's unreasonable to try and stop white from getting any territory. You just need to stop him from getting more than you.]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[ql];W[qn];B[sl];W[sn];B[ri];W[rh];B[rg]
;W[sh];B[si];W[oj];B[pj];W[re];B[rd]C[Meekohi: This turns into a disaster quickly, R15 would have been better but I was worried about white taking the corner.

Fernobob: I'm not sure really.It doesn't look so good but R15 doesn't so much either. I think R16 might be better.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[rc]LB[qc:A]C[this stone can't actually live and so it is useless trying to defend it. A play at A instead would seal white off far more effectively. It is often worth sacrificing a few stones to seal your terriotry, especially when the stones are already dead.]
;W[qc];B[rb]C[Meekohi: Useless.

Fernobob: Yep];W[qb];B[ob];W[rf];B[qg];W[pf];B[pg];W[of];B[og]
;W[ng]C[Fernobob: I assume you noticed what was wrong with this. It's generally worth reading a bit with weak stones to make sure they can escape before trying or you can make it very easy for the opponent.]
;B[nf]LB[oe:A]C[This virtually forces white to reduce your territory. A would be better as it stops him in sente.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[ne];B[nd];W[me];B[le];W[lb];B[mb];W[jd];B[mf]
;W[sg];B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[lh];B[pc];W[pb];B[lc];W[kb];B[nc]
;W[jf]C[Meekohi: At this point I looked over the board again and realized I had basically no territory to speak of, so resigned.

Meekohi has resigned.

Fernobob: You don't have much, but neither does white. You also have a group to attack in the lower left and so although you're behind, it may be worth playing on.]
