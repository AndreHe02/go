C[In this game I feel that my play was not terrible in the first 100 moves or so, but nevertheless I fell way behind. Could you please help point out my mistakes?

WOG: I will try my best.];B[qd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pq];B[po];W[np]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or];B[qk]C[I thought this joseki was good for this situation because it keeps black low on the right and white O4 coordinates with D4.

WOG: Yes, I prefer that Black be at q8 here for balance with the stone at R16, but not a huge difference because of Black's slight misstep]
;W[nc]C[Maybe this should be at O16 or P16, I am not sure. I played this way to try and prevent black from playing on both sides.

WOG: Sometimes Go is feeling your way.  What's the absolute best move here?  No one knows today.  This seems fine to me.  Keep Black from making the shimari that would help on the right side.]
;B[cn]C[WOG: Tenuki seems odd.  You're in the midst of Black space up above and Black plays away...]
;W[fp];B[dk]C[WOG: D10 would be my preference to coordinate better with the stone at c16]
;W[qc]C[Hard for me to label this as a mistake, but maybe F16 or E16 would be better.

WOG: Yes, I would have prefered that to break the other potential shimari on the other side.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[qb];W[rc];B[od];W[pe];B[oc];W[rb];B[of]C[Black deviates from joseki here so I should be able to get a good result.

WOG: Generally, I don't like that statement.  Deviating from joseki at shodan should be possible with a good result, if done for the right reasons, etc.   The other problem with the statement is that you still need to read.  Pros read.  We need to do our best to read.  What if this is a new joseki?  Unless you know all joseki and all their variations pat, then who's to say if this is good or bad?  Context matters a lot in Go...]
;W[oe]C[WOG: Yes, seems like the obvious move, but did you read it all out?]
;B[ne]
(;W[qe]C[WOG: Seems like Black did OK with this variation with your play here]
;B[nd]C[I get sente to play in top left and black still has a cutting point at O14. The position is not what I expected, but I am happy.

WOG: Black's position aint terrible... Sente is nice for White.]
;W[fd]C[This feels correct to me in this situation.

WOG: Yeah, playing away from the corner either here or one line lower seems right...]
;B[fe]C[WOG: So many complicated josekis...]
(;W[dd]C[WOG: One of many possibilities...];B[de];W[ee];B[ef]
;W[ed];B[ce]
(;W[cc]C[WOG: One possibility...];B[gd];W[gc];B[ge];W[hc]C[This move is why I chose this joseki, since it neutralizes black's thickness on top.

WOG: Fine.];B[bc];W[db];B[cb];W[dc];B[qf]C[WOG: Big tenuki!]
;W[rf]C[WOG: Not sure I like this.  It compels Black to fix Black's position... S15?]
(;B[re]C[WOG: Strange throw in.  See tewari analysis in variation]
;W[rd];B[pf];W[se]C[I think this is ok for me since black still has the cutting point and is still open on the right.

WOG: Tewari makes this bad for Black];B[kc]C[This i saw as a mistake on his part, so I try to take advantage of it.

WOG: There are three ways to take advantage of mistakes - address immediately, save for later, and let the fire burn across the river.  Moreover, this is not necessarily a big mistake.  Black has either the cut to fix or play on the side.  Black played on the side.  For thickness purposes and styles, one might play the mighty but slow move at o14.  Ruminate on O14.  Savor it.  Strong, ka na?  Playing B18 is also good.]
;W[eg]C[Since black didn't protect the cutting point as in the joseki I want to take advantage of that.

WOG: Black left the big play in the corner at b18.  This move at e13 is your right from this joseki.  Remeber, there's a right time to capitalize on weaknesses]
;B[df];W[ff]
(;B[dh]C[WOG: Too submissive, Black should sacrifice the three stones and power up the side.]
;W[dg]C[WOG: Sniff sniff... this smells like an overplay.  You read this all out before playing here?]
(;B[cg]C[WOG: Black seems a bit submissive here, but everybody has to read]
(;W[eh]C[WOG: Ugh.  Really?  Save some aji or options.  This can revert back to the more aggressive Black play]
;B[di];W[gf];B[he]C[WOG: Now Black can afford to come out and the Black side is strong.  Wondering how White fell behind now?  This is how.]
(;W[jd]C[Maybe this is a mistake, it looks a little strange, I have included what I think could be a variation, but I am not sure.

WOG: The Four Questions Rule must be learned!  Where am I strong/weak; where is opponent strong/weak?  Play away from strength.  Play closer to weakness.  Because Black did not play B18, are these White stones the weak one's up above, or the one's in the middle?  Yes, the one's in the middle need the help!]
(;B[hf]C[WOG: Seems too direct and forces White to fix shape.  Everyone has to read.  G12 is very appealing... Try to break shape first, if possible.]
;W[gh]C[These stones feel heavy to me.

WOG: Because you didn't follow the Four Questions.];B[jc]C[WOG: Now Black ignores the Four Questions]
;W[id];B[ig];W[hg]C[WOG: Breaking Black's shape, after my admonishment, is a good idea, but Black can break your shape first!]
(;B[jf]C[WOG: Doh!  Black!  Break White's shape first!  Way too submissive!!!]
;W[ih]C[WOG: Now, White's shape is perfect... terrible result for Black]
;B[jh];W[ii];B[ji]C[Now, all of a sudden, I feel far behind.

WOG: Because you didn't follow the Four Questions and your idea that there was a right you had to capitalize on from the joseki, you created a burden.  There's a rule in Go and options and fruit - don't play until ripe.  You played with the idea that the position was ripe for the plucking.  Wrong attitude; bad result.]
;W[kg]C[WOG: Don't peep at random];B[jg];W[nf]C[WOG: What?  Is the battle in the middle over?]
(;B[ph]C[WOG: Aaaiiigggh!  What's the point of these three stones right now?]
;W[qh]C[Maybe better at P12.

WOG: What's better at P12?  White?  I don't think there's much to do at P12 for White.]
;B[pi]C[WOG: Ouch!];W[ke]C[WOG: What's the strategy here?];B[kf]
;W[le]
(;B[mc]C[WOG: Doh!  Don't let White come in between if possible.  Ignore small profits up above]
;W[lf];B[ij]C[WOG: Giant Hane!];W[hi]C[WOG: Ouch ouch ouch]
;B[jk]C[WOG: Not the best result for Black, but Black's fine.]
;W[hj]C[WOG: Why this slow turn?  Don't force Black to make perfect shape!]
;B[hk]C[WOG: Perfect shape for Black];W[il]C[WOG: Don't peep at random!!!]
;B[ik];W[jq];B[jo]C[WOG: Two meanings move];W[jp]C[Maybe this is a bad answer, perhaps M4 would be better.]
;B[io];W[hp];B[cq]C[WOG: Is this right for Black?  Is Black so far behind that Black needs to invade?  I don't think so, but everyone has to count!!!]
;W[cp];B[bp]
(;W[dq]C[WOG: If White plays this way Black's invasion is Great!  You must count and play accordingly!!!]
;B[br];W[cr];B[bq];W[dn]C[This is a mistake in direction I think, maybe something like P5 or P6 instead?

WOG: Counting, then strategy!];B[dm];W[co];B[bo]C[This seems like a mistake to me.

WOG: This is fine.];W[cm]C[WOG: White has problems with the group above... there's aji.  Can White have a stray group and a group with aji?]
