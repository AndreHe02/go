C[AbuDhabi: First thing I want to thank You for the review. :) I'm going to put some questions at points that caught my attention.



I played this game on KGS. At first I was doing very badly - which is the reason I submit this - but managed to get ahead later. I want to know why I sucked so bad there!

s: Hello.  My name is Sam Tregar and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm 8-kyu on KGS and 7-kyu in the AGA.  I'll do my best to review your game but please realize that I'm only a little better than you!  If you have questions please feel free to write me at sam@tregar.com or find me on KGS where I play as "samtregar".

s: I'll prefix all my comments with "s:".];B[pp];W[dc];B[dp]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[qf]LB[qg:A]C[s: This seems too small to me.  I think A is a better move here if you want to settle quickly.]
;B[qc];W[qj]LB[ne:B][qh:A][cn:C][fq:D]TR[qd][qf]C[s: There are a few things wrong with this move.  First, it's too far from the marked stones to be surely connected to them, black could play at A later and divide your groups.  Second, it's too far from the lower right corner to be a threat there.  So it seems to me to be a move without clear purpose.  Instead, I would either continue in the corner with a move like B or head off to attack a corner with something like C or D.]
;B[ql]C[s: Good move.  This serves two purposes - it attacks  white and expands blacks corner.]
;W[qn]C[s: This would be stronger if R10 wasn't weak.];B[qo]
LB[ol:A]C[s: Odd trade for black.  It would be better to just play A straightaway.]
;W[pn];B[ol];W[nn];B[no]LB[np:A]C[s: This feels like an overplay to me.  A seems like a better move.]
;W[mn];B[oj];W[oh]LB[ph:B][pi:A]C[s: This looks really bad to me.  It's too far from the marked stone to help.  What will you do if black plays A?  I would prefer a play at A or B.  The fact that this is necessary only shows that R10 was misplaced.]
;B[kp];W[gq]LB[fq:A]C[AbuDhabi: This is where the fighting starts. I messed up somewhere and am not certain where.

s: I think you have the right idea, but I would have prefered A.  This feels a little too far from the corner.]
;B[fq];W[jq]LB[gp:A]C[s: Usually you would play A instead.  Otherwise black will play it which will be painful.]
;B[kq];W[jp];B[jo];W[io];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp]
(;W[ho]LB[hq:A]C[s: This move is suicide!  You have to play A here to have a chance at living below.]
;B[gp];W[go];B[fo];W[hq]LB[hl:B][hm:A]TR[jp][gq][iq][jq]C[s: There is absolutely no reason to play this move.  It should be obvious that the marked stones are dead.  Better to run at A or B and not lose both groups.]
;B[fp];W[jn];B[ko];W[kn];B[in];W[hm];B[im];W[hl];B[il];W[ik]
;B[hn];W[gn];B[gm];W[fn];B[gl];W[hk];B[en];W[fm];B[fl];W[jl]
;B[em];W[ej]LB[jc:C][ce:B][cj:A]C[s: This moves seems to serve no discernable purpose.   It's much too far from the marked stones to be an extension.  And it's too hight to make territory.  It's just sitting out there asking to be attacked!  Instead, try A, B or C]
;B[di]LB[fj:A][gj:B][jm:C]C[s: Black is giving you a gift.  He should have cut off your stone around A or B.  If he follows with C you'll surely lose something!]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[eg]LB[ei:A]C[s: Another strange move.  When black plays A how will this move help you?]
;B[gj]C[s: Yes.];W[gk];B[fk];W[fj];B[gi];W[ei];B[jk];W[jj];B[kk]
;W[mk];B[ij]C[s: ouch, another painful loss.];W[jd]LB[ck:A]
C[s: This is a big move but badly timed.  If black can turn the whole lower left into territory then he'll almost certainly win.  You need to tend to your group on that side.  A looks promising.]
;B[kl]C[s: Tiny.];W[nc]C[s: Good move.  This attacks black and expands your territorial possibilities at the same time.]
;B[ln]C[s: Another tiny move.  Black is really slipping.];W[mm]
LB[nl:A]C[s: If there's on thing you should learn right away it's to never make empty triangles!  This shape is very weak.  Instead A is just as connected and much stronger.]
;B[km];W[hg]LB[ic:B][ce:A]C[s: This move is a little vague.  It seems to be trying to stake out territory in the upper left but I think it's an overplay.  The corner is still open at A and the top is open around B.  I'd prefer a move at A to lock up the corner.]
;B[lc];W[le]LB[md:A][ne:B]TR[oh]C[s: This is better at A or B.  Otherwise black can play A and probably live...  Compare this bad move to the marked bad move - same problem both times!]
;B[eh]C[s: Terrible move.  Black is much too weak for this to work.]
;W[dg]LB[dh:A]C[s: I think A would have worked.];B[dh];W[cg]

;B[bc];W[db];B[bd];W[dd];B[bf];W[bg];B[ca];W[da];B[ba];W[cf]
;B[be];W[af]C[AbuDhabi: I probably should not have done this, no? It's gote and Black still lives...

s: Yes.  This is a wasted move.];B[ae];W[ag];B[jc];W[hd]LB[ic:A]
C[s: this looks too submissive to me.  I think you need to take a hard line here with A.]
;B[hc];W[mb];B[lb];W[kd]C[s: This is a very submissive move.  You're handing black good shape and getting little in return.]
;B[kc];W[id]C[s: Again, this helps black more than you!];B[ic]

s: No, not at this point.  T18 and S19 are miai.];W[qq];B[pq]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]LB[ro:A]C[s: This doesn't look needed here.  Black should play A and kill the corner.]

[br][cr][dr][mr][nr][as][bs][cs][ds][ms]C[AbuDhabi: Thanks again!

s: This was an interesting game to review.  Black played a much better opening but your middle and end-game was so much better that you overcame Black's lead easily.  Black played many wasted moves and failed to kill your groups on the bottom left and right.

s: I think your biggest mistakes were when you played moves that were both too far from your groups and too far from the opponent.  R10 is a good example. On the other hand, your knowledge of life-and-death is quite good.  My advice is to read lots of games on the teaching ladder and play as often as you can.  You should improve fast.

s: Thank you for allowing me to review your game.])
