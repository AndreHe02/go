C[This game was playaed on the 19th of aug. 2011. I (scaoroc tygem17k) was black. Also I commented the game to make it easier to understand by reasoning, and my level of play. (which is preatty much beginner..)

Holger:
Hi, my name is Holger and I will be reviewing your game. I have started all my contributions with my name, so that you know which comments are from me. A short summary is at the end.]

(;B[fq]TR[jp]C[Holger: 
I like the low chinese opening. 
Playing at K4 here would give you a much stronger framework.]
;W[hq];B[cq];W[cp]TR[dj]C[Holger: 
Ideally white should only block with C4 if there is a white stone at the marked point. You can take advantage of this mistake.]
;B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[fr]C[Holger: 
Playing the joseki this way lets white get away with the mistake. See the alternative play.]
;W[go]C[Holger: 
White has successfully caged you in, in exchange for some territory.]
;B[cj]TR[cf][lp][kq]C[Holger: 
This move does not attack white in any way and it does not build any framework. 
Consider playing at L3 or M4 to build your framework and reduce white's influence or at C14 to attack white's corner. (I would prefer L3 myself)]
;W[cm]TR[cl]C[Holger: 
This move is too timid. White has a strong wall that allows an extension up to C8.]
;B[cg]C[Holger: 
Again giving up sente for some territory.];W[nq]C[Holger: 
Too late...]
(;B[op];W[np];B[oo]C[Holger: 
While making territory, the following sequence gives white a very strong wall.]
;W[no];B[on];W[nn];B[ol];W[nm]TR[nn][go][no][np][hq][nq]C[Holger: 
Now the stones at H3 and G5 are ideally placed with respect to white's new wall.]
;B[nl];W[ek]LB[dl:A]C[Holger: 
This move would have worked a lot better for white if C7 was at C8. Now white has a weak spot at A.]
(;B[cd]TR[bd]C[Holger: 
Attaching here is not a good idea. Play at B16 instead];W[cc]
;B[ce];W[bc]TR[af]C[Holger: 
Now white has the corner and is threatening the monkey jump at A14.]
;B[fd];W[hc]
(;B[ec]C[Holger: 
Attacking the cut here just makes white stronger.
See alternative.];W[dc]
(;B[ff]C[Holger: 
E14 is certainly better here.];W[ee];B[fe];W[df]
(;B[cf]C[Holger: 
No need to protect here. Better to keep white contained.
See alternative];W[ef];B[fh];W[eh];B[dh];W[ei];B[md]MA[ec][fd]
[fe][ff][fh][qk][nl][ol]C[try to use the freshly gained thickness to keep white low and develop some center territory.

Holger: 
There are some problems with that reasoning:
a) The white stones at H17 and L17 diminish the influence of your wall around F15.
b) The wall is not connected to a base and could come under threat. Consider white next at H14 or J14
c) A Go proverb says "There is no territory in the center."]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[eg];B[hf];W[gh];B[hh]C[Holger: 
You should thank white for letting you get eye shape here.]
;W[gi]
(;B[mc]LB[lc:A]TR[ke]C[got sente, why not attack, maybe A would've been better

Holger: 
N17 is fine. But instead of attacking, why not stick to your earlier plan of getting center territory? L15 is an option]
;W[mb]
(;B[oc]TR[lb]C[Holger: 
You are forcing white to strengthen his group. M18 is much better here.]

You can safely play double hane here.];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg]
;W[lf];B[lc];W[kb];B[jc]C[Holger: 
As you probably noticed later, this stone was lost the moment you played it.]
;W[ic];B[jj]TR[ki][kj]C[Holger: 
A play on one of the marked points would help enclose the territory on the right and put the two white stones under pressure a lot more.]
;W[lh]LB[lj:A][lk:B]MA[kf][lf]C[tought this group have no chance... should've enclose first at A

Holger: 
Play at B would be better than A. With B K10 and O8 are connected by knight's moves.]
(;B[mg]TR[oh][lk]C[Holger: 
If you want to put white under pressure remember the principle to attack from a distance.
M9 cages white in, in the hope of capturing the stones. 
If you are not sure whether you can capture the stones and you want to protect you territory P12 will reduce white's potential for eye shape while securing the right for black. After P12 white has to escape to the bottom.]
;W[kh];B[jh]C[Holger:
Not necessary. Still time to play M9.];W[lj];B[ll]LB[kk:A]TR[ni]
C[now it's late, and i have the weakness at A

Holger:
Yes, but you can still chase white and make territory on the way.]
;W[ni];B[mh]TR[pi][kk]C[i didn't wanted to let him make any shape

Holger: 
White still has the option of escaping at L9. Either play there to prevent white from running away (risky, now that white has gotten stronger). 
A better move now is Q11. This would force white to play L9 or try to make eye shape. You would have secured your side territory in sente.]
;W[mi]LB[kk:A]
(;B[og]TR[pi]C[was this unnesesary?

Holger:
Yes Q11 is much better here. Don't try to capture white at all cost. Make him run and use your advantage to make territory.]
;W[kk]MA[ec][fd][fe][ff][hf][jf][gg][jg][hh][jh][jj]C[now it escaped so i need to make eyeshape for my marked group]

Holger:
The marked group doesn't have much influence except, of course, for the threat at A14.]
;W[km]C[Holger:
White has to escape but protects his territory at the same time.]

I think i need to do many many L and D problems. I happy for the game, couse  i think i could use my thickness at move 16 well, but i messed up with the group cought in it.

Holger:
Overall, an interesting game. 
I think you lost the game on two issues. The group on the left could have been defended simply by playing B16 early on in the game. But even a correct response to the monkey jump would have still saved it.
The other issue concerned the white group around N13. There was the chance to capture it with a move at M9. Once the white group had a way to escape, instead of desperately trying to capture it, you should focus on finding moves that threaten the group while you are making territory.]
