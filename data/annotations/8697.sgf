C[Hello,

I would like you to point out my main weaknesses and where I can improve the most.

I would also like to know how black was able to reduce my territory all the way across the top of the board.

Don't be afraid to give critisizing comments.
Thank you very much!



# Hi Henry! I am siowy from Singapore, 8 kyu on KGS. I have been playing Go for about a year. This is my first review for the GTL and I hope you will find it clear and instructive. 

# I am commenting on the moves as I see them for the first time. I have put special attention on answering your answers.

# UL - upper left corner, UR - upper right, LR - lower right, LL - lower left.

# If you have any follow-up questions, you can email me at siowy@yahoo.com.

# My comments will all be preceded by the # sign.];B[pc]LB[qe:A]
C[henrib736 [21k\]: good game

# Though you have requested a review for White, I have included some comments for Black as well.

# 3-4 point balances territory and influence, with the clear follow-up enclosure/approach at A. 

# The joseki for 3-4 point are somewhat harder to remember than for the 4-4 point(called hoshi), so I usually just play the 4-4 point.]
;W[dp]LB[cn:A][fq:B]C[# 4-4 point is fast (influences a large amount of the board) and flexible (can take territory or influence, one side or the other), but does not secure the corner by itself.

# Unlike the 3-4 point, there is no urgent point nearby for either player, since A and B are miai (if one player takes one, her partner can take the other).]
;B[pe];W[dd]C[germun30k: hi

# Good to occupy another corner.];B[nd]LB[jd:A][qj:B]C[# This move is much too slow for the opening(also called fuseki). It is also overconcentrated.

# The usual is A or B after settling all the corners.];W[pp]
C[# Well-played so far for White :)];B[kd]LB[fc:A][qj:B]C[# Still too slow. 

# Every move in the fuseki should prompt a reaction from your partner, for example by approaching a corner (A) or playing a large extension (B).

# Good Go is a dance between two partners, not each one doing her own thing.]
;W[dj]LB[jj:A]C[# White is creating a huge, framework (though thin for now).

# Just an aside, I would also consider tengen (A) now, since nearly all the stones so far are on the 4th line: the line of influence. We can thus usually expect more territory in the center. 

# If more stones were on the 3rd line(the line of territory), then more of the territory will be at the sides and corners.

# But tengen is a romantic move, and can turn out to be useless sometimes.]
;B[ph];W[jp]C[# Perfect. White's stones are all working together.]
;B[pk];W[jj]C[# Beautiful.];B[ki]TR[fd][cf][df][cg][dg][ch]
[dh][cl][dl][cm][dm][cn][dn][fp][gp][hp][lp][mp][np][fq][gq]
[hq][lq][mq][nq]C[# Black tries to keep her portion of the center. But her portion of the center is small now, and this move is in bad shape relative to the White stone.

# I would prefer to play in the marked areas as Black, since White is too strong in the center now, and it is not good to fight in a way that is beneficial to your partner.]
;W[kj]C[# What an interesting game! This reminds me of those one-on-one duels in old times, where two heroes would fight within a circle surrounded by soldiers of both sides.

# I like this move. It starts a fight that is favourable for White (White had the first stone in the area).]
;B[li]LB[lj:A]C[# A is necessary if Black still wants her portion of the center.]
;W[lj]LB[ji:A]C[# I think this is a fine move. I would also consider hane(bend) at A.]
;B[mi]C[# Hane when you can withstand the cut, extend when you cannot. Black should hane here as there are many black stones nearby to fight if there is a cut.]

[mi][ni][oi]C[# This move is the second mistake. In this situation, the mistake is not as bad as it usually is, but it is still a fundamental mistake.

# This is an issue of when to play contact plays and when to play from a distance. 

# A contact play like this usually invokes a standard response of A, which is bad for White. See variation. B is played when Black cannot withstand the cut. 

# However, in this situation, A and B would both be overconcentrated with the marked stones in the area, so Black can just tenuki(play away from the local area) with a move around C or D, trying to swallow the K16 stone on a larger scale.

# So to summarise, K16 is playing too close to Black's strength, and it's better to play a bit further away, for example H16, H15, G16, G15, J12.

# Also, it  is better to continue pushing or jump at LR. See variation.]
;B[ke]C[# As mentioned, this is over-concentrated.];W[je];B[kf]
;W[jg]C[# Jumping here is a bit shaky. The general rule is to have three stones before jumping. See variation.

# Even if we do not expect our partner to be skilled enough to punish a shaky play, it is better to just play solidly and not focus on our partner, unless we are behind in the game and need to overplay to catch up.]
(;B[kg];W[kh]C[# I wonder what White was trying with this move. It doesn't do anything. See variation.]

;W[jc];B[kc];W[jb]LB[ib:A]C[# Capturing at A is probably better. 

# The general rule between capturing and extending is to capture to remove the aji(potential value later), unless the extending stone is very valuable.

# It is difficult to seal off our partner with contact plays.


# On a larger scale, the UR is Black's. White should take about 3/4 of the territory in the middle and bottom area. LR has Black breaking through White's wall again, and the black invasion near the UL has not been sealed off yet.

============================================================

To improve, you should 

a) try to see when stones should be sacrificed, and sacrifice them.
b) remember the four lines and their purposes.
c) be more aware of the 3-3 point's power to live in the corner.
d) practise more life and death problems(also called tsumego). You can find a large collection at goproblems.com

This was an enjoyable game to review. If you have any follow-up questions, feel free to email me at siowy@yahoo.com.]
