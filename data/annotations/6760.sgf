C[Hey There,

My name's Derek, I'll be reviewing your game. I'm 8k on KGS.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[oq];W[pq];B[op]C[OK so far];W[oo]
C[First bad move by W.

The move doesn't server any purpose: It doesn't build a base, build territory, establish thickness, or eliminate the opponent's base. It's easily cut, and basically creates a seperate weak group.

Your group in the corner is safe already, so you can either attack the group by threatening it's base, or tenuki and play elsewhere.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[pp]C[Now the mistake earlier cost you]
(;W[pn]C[Very weak connection - Easily cut in both directions.

I'd strengthen the corner instead, then play elsewhere.];B[qn]
C[Ouch #1.]
(;W[nq]C[Pointless move - Easily cut.

Your groups aren't in a position to attack Black's right now. You have a major cutting point in the lower right, AND a major cutting point at the top. You need to fix your positions before you can attack.

Also, to attack do not attach - You attack by threatening to take away Black's base. The 2 variations illustrate how this would look - ONLY a good move if your group is strong, which it's not.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[on];W[no];B[pm]C[You now have two weak groups. Black has very strong influence towards center.]

(;W[nr];B[or];W[qr];B[np]
(;W[mo]C[The 2 variations shown are strong ways to connect the groups.]
;B[mp];W[lp]C[Too weak to create cutting points. Very dangerous, will cost you later.]
;B[mr];W[ns]C[Wasted move. Stones on the bottom are dead.];B[mq]

(;W[qs]C[Wasted move - Corner is already alive.];B[ps];W[nn]
C[Again, connect. Empty triangle is very bad shape. You have 4 stones with only 3 liberties.]
;B[nm];W[mm]C[Connect is essential here.];B[lo];W[mn];B[kp]
;W[lq]C[Read ahead before you move - This move is completely wasted.]
;B[lr];W[ko];B[kq];W[ln];B[lp];W[nl];B[om];W[ol];B[pl];W[pk]
;B[qk]TR[kn][ml][ok]MA[ln][mm][mn][mo][nn][no][oo]C[All these cutting points (Triangle) make this group EXTREMELY weak.

The Xed group is also very bad shape.

One big area to improve your game in would be to play in straight lines, and much, much less "curves" (cutting points.)]

;W[km];B[jm];W[jl];B[kn];W[oj];B[md]TR[co]
(;W[nd]C[No! Unless you have a very good reason, attaching to an enemy stone is generally a bad idea. It only causes him to strengthen, and you have a lone stone in enemy territory.

You also have an unfinished corner. Instead of trying to invade B's relatively strong area, strengthen your area instead.]
;B[nc];W[ne];B[od]C[You just gave B the whole corner & side.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[oc];B[nb];W[ob];B[mb];W[lc]C[Again, read ahead - It's a ladder.]

;B[cm];W[cl];B[dm];W[dl];B[en];W[em];B[fn];W[fm];B[ep];W[fo]
C[Again, you now have 3 weak groups all split up.];B[eq];W[gn]
;B[dn];W[er];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq]C[Again, read ahead - Ladder.]
;B[aq];W[fq];B[br];W[fp];B[fr];W[gr];B[es];W[gq]C[Group is probably dead ...]

TR[je]C[If you can connect this group, now is the essential time to do it.]
;W[gh];B[jb];W[ff];B[lf]C[All in all, the major points to work on are:

1) Recognize and avoid cutting points. Generally, any time you "curve" you create a cutting point. Try to play in straight lines.

2) Avoid having your groups split into multiple weak groups. Pay attention to having a good base for every group, especially before attacking.

3) Learn some shapes - Avoid bad shapes, strive to create good shapes.

All the best,

- Derek
