Hi,

I am Jens-Uwe and currently around 6k on KGS (user 'jug'), so please take my comments in this review not as the absolute truth, but I will try and give what insights I can at my level.

All my comments begin with 'JUG'. When introducing go-concepts i mostly use japanese terms, but i've added a short description on first use; a more detailed explanation you may find on Sensei's Library http://senseis.xmp.net/, which is also a great free resource about all topics of Go.
I've used CGoban v3.3.13 to edit this SGF.

JUG: How to read the review:

Please follow the main-path and the referred variations there, because some basics are explained in those variations, that are needed to understand some follow-up-comments in the review. I refer to them as "see var before" (var starting from previous move) or "see next var" (var starting with the current node). Your questioned variations are marked with a starting '?'.

There are many variations sometimes and i recommend to check out all of them containing many examples of alternative moves to give you some ideas how it could happen, but be aware not to get lost (^_^).

I've tried to answer your questions, included chances B and also W missed, what to look out for and how to handle certain situations. At the end of the game i finish with a summary and on what to concentrate to improve.

Enjoy the review!

Cheers,
JUG];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce]C[JUG: good so far, making a shimari (corner enclosure) is a big move, because it gives you sure territory.]
;W[jc]C[JUG: this is a normal invasion to avoid B getting a big top]

(;B[ck]LB[jc:D][lc:B][nc:A][ce:C]C[JUG: this is questionable, it looks big, but the fact, that the 'C'-stone is low on 3rd line makes the left side unattractive. One could say, the development of the left side is finished with 'C' on the 3rd line. C9 is a bit inefficient, because it is also low. It is not really bad, but those small details come more into focus when you get stronger.
Those tiny differences of played moves during a game alltogether make stones more efficient and sum up to a considerable advantage later in the game.

Attending to your upper right corner instead should be bigger and preferred in the current situation, also putting some pressure on the W invasion-stone 'D'. I would have taken 'A' or 'B' now instead (see vars before).]

(;W[jp]LB[gc:C][mc:D][oc:B][od:A]TR[jc]C[JUG: as W i would have preferred 'A' or 'B' now (for examples see vars before)

The term 'miai' is an importang go-concept and is explained now:
The marked W stone has 'C' and 'D' miai to make a base. If B takes one move near 'C' or 'D', W can get the other and vice versa.
Miai is not only applied when making a base, but also taking big opening points, spots in making a life group or making exchanges of groups (furikawari = kind of exchange that is sacrificing whole groups to get points somewhere else).]
;B[nc]C[JUG: good (making a shimari and attack W)];W[gc]LB[ib:3]
[bc:2][nc:B][pc:4][ce:C][ch:1][jj:11][qj:5][ck:A][cm:10][cq:9]
[gq:8][mq:7][qq:6]C[JUG: Here i introduce a schema to identify where to engage next (in terms of areas where to play next)

In the var at move #15 i'm introducing a schema how to find your next move. For that, the following "tool" is also helpful to identify areas worth of engaging.

1. count and number different areas occupied of own and others group and stones (areas, not the moves) -> here we can identify 11 areas marked with numbers.
2. outrule areas that are safe and uninteresting to engage -> area 2, 3, 4 are settled (or you could say, without support an invasion or hassling them would be very hard), though '4' can be invaded if W has more stones around for example.
3. weight the different areas against each other: which are wider, easier to enter, harder to enter and also look out for "desires" of your stones and groups on the board. That's the more difficult part. Another term for "desire" is "direction of play": it's described in the book "The Direction of Play" by Kajiwara Takeo.

For example, the "desire" of the top right corner is to get an extension, 'A' wants to be settled or help in building a moyo, the W san-ren-sei-formation at the bottom wants to build a moyo; other desires can be: making an extension, denying an extension, creating a double-wing, etc.

So to apply item (3) on this board position
- widest area is '5' and '11'. The center we rule out for the moment according to proverb "first corner, then side, then center". That means, as long as there is corner and side territory to gain, we don't approach the center. Take this advice with caution, because it is also a matter of style; but don't underestimate the value of corner and side territory over engagements in direction of the center. Most often it doesn't pay off, because it's harder to make territory in the center.
- areas '1,8,7' are equal of width but '1' is on 3rd line, so '1' is less attractive compared to '8,7'
- areas '6, 9' are equal, though '6' is wider because '9' has a B stone nearby

=> area '5' combines three desires: 1. a move there would be an extension of top right corner, 2. it denies W an extension for a moyo (proverb: "play where other wants to play"), and 3. it is the widest area. So with a move in that area, we can combine three purpose in one move.

Applying this AREA-SCHEMA to the previous move, B at 'B' would also make a double-purpose-move: 1. it makes a shimari (corner enclosure), 2. it attacks Ws stone in sente (needing a base) -> so B gets a move for free.

As contradiction, the move 'A' served also two purposes (own extension, deny opponent extension, but as 'C' low and even not the preferred direction because the shimari is facing the right side), therefore such a move is inferior.
I'm coming back to that schema when talking about invasions.]

(;B[pj]LB[qd:A]C[too high?

JUG: no, this looks perfect, good balance (with 'A' being low)]
;W[pe]C[JUG: this is a reduction-move, W coming in before B gets too big]
;B[pd]C[JUG: good];W[oe]
(;B[me]LB[qg:A][pj:B]C[JUG: this is not good: This move is driving W towards your (weak) stone 'B'.

The valueable points are to be found in the corners or at the side, so go there first before you enter the center.
The N15-move may aim to separate the two W groups; this would be good, if your 'B'-stone would already be settled.

The right idea is to make or keep the invading/reducing group weak by making it hard for your opponents group to live, so in this case your alternative 'A' looks better (see var before).

---

Here is the right place to introduce a thinking process, that provides help to find multi-purpose-moves (see the next single-noded var).]

(;W[ph]
(;B[pn]LB[qn:A]C[JUG: I would prefer 'A' (see var before), but your move is ok too, though it's not directly settling your stones (there are on the 4th-line). Settling your group is easier on the 3rd line.]
;W[np]LB[og:A][qg:C][oh:B][qh:D][pl:F][qp:E]C[JUG: the problem now is, that the 'F'-space is a bit too wide, giving W a good invasion point, so B should defend first before going on]

(;B[og]LB[qg:B][qh:C][pj:A][qp:D]C[looks wrong..

JUG: yes. Going for the base is another alternative with 'B' for example, but it's not the right idea now.
Your move may aim to enclose W to the right side, but the side is very big. Why give it to W ?

There's the proverb: "first corner, then side, then center". It does not only apply to early fuseki (opening), but can be applied for many more situations (like this fight for example): 1. is there a corner-based move, that allows to attack ? no -> 2. is there a side-based move to attack ? yes -> 'BC'; if no -> 3. check for center-moves

It's not good to attack a group, if you have weak groups nearby ('A' isn't particularly strong).
I would have settled 'A' first, maybe with 'C' (which also attacks). Another way would be 'D' (see vars before)
It's one thing to keep your groups healthy, but to attack nearby groups you should be strong or attacking can backfire.]

(;W[nf]C[JUG: this was not good by W (see var before)]
(;B[oh]LB[pg:A]C[JUG: this is helping W, better should be at 'A' (see var before)]
;W[pg];B[oi]C[JUG: B needed another move, so this sequence ended gote (starting with a shoulder-hit it most often does end in gote) giving the initiative to W), so in summary it was not good. When attacking, one should keep sente (initiative) as long as possible.]
;W[ql]C[JUG: this is dangerous for W as long as his top right group isn't settled yet]

(;B[pl]C[R10 better?

JUG: no, this is fine];W[qj];B[qi]C[JUG: good, W misread];W[pi]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[rk]C[JUG: good];W[ri];B[nj]LB[oj:A][ok:B][ql:C]
C[JUG: good, protecting the cut is very important here, but protecting solidly with 'A' is better.
W then would have less ko-threats, especially a W peep at 'B' (see next var) reviving the aji (potential complications) of the 'C'-stone.]

(;W[qn]LB[qe:A][pg:B]C[JUG: a bit dangerous for W.
W should settle his top group with 'A' first. B may choose to ignore this and start hassling Ws 'B'-group, though i wouldn't recommend it.]

(;B[qm]LB[qn:B][qo:A]C[JUG: this is a bit submissive, B at 'A' is more interesting (see var before), W at 'B' looks like an overplay
B could even ignore here and attack the top group instead first.]
;W[qo];B[rf]C[JUG: very good using your sente.
This is the right idea, attack W while he's weak (W should have defended this group earlier).

If you see a chance with an EASY kill of opponent, use it, but don't try if you don't see a clear path.
W has no way to make two eyes at the side, so he must run now.]

(;W[qf]LB[pf:A][mg:C][qg:B]C[JUG: this is not helping W, but it protects the cut 'A' and is sente, or the B stone get caught and W lives.
Also W at 'B' is not helpful. The only chance may be to walk out with 'C' (see vars before).]
;B[rg]C[JUG: very good];W[od]C[JUG: this move is not good for W. It gets nothing for W and helps B closing the corner (classical 'thank-you-move')]

(;B[qh]LB[me:B][qi:A]C[JUG: this is not good, it is big, but ends gote for B and W cannot live with capturing 'A' (see var before)

(;W[rh]LB[le:A]C[JUG: W shows poor reading, he should instead let go of those 3 stones (they are already dead) and jump out: 'A' would be good, escaping into the center (see var before).]

JUG: Yes, though B missed a chance before to surely kill them (as shown), there may be stil a way (added some comments to your variation and more variations)
But also be aware that Ws move is attacking the stone at the side 'A' right now.

next vars shows: 'K' (your question), 'L' (3-3 invasion living with ko), 'M' (examples for bottom invasion)

---
This is a good position to give another example of how to use THE-LIST and the AREA-SCHEMA:

THE-LIST:
1. is B ok ? where are your groups (mark them) -> 'A' (single stone, so no group), 'BCD' all safe => so 2nd question
2. is W ok ? mark groups -> 'EFG', 'H' (single stone, though stronger with O4 not so far away) => 'E' healthy (has base and can't be put under severe attack now), 'F' safe, 'G' (safe, though ogeima shimari, so has a bit weakness), 'H' safe, 'J' very weak (no eyes yet) => so THE-LIST would propose to attack 'J'

After knowing what to do and where, search for moves that accomplish that goal.

AREA-SCHEMA: Let's assume that we don't want to attack the 'J'-group or that is settled or connected.
1. count areas and mark them -> '1-9'
2. outrule safe / uninteresting areas -> '2345' safe, '9' too wide open and corner and sides are still open (proverb "first corner/side/center")
=> '1' wide and under attack by C7 (desire is to defend), '6' wants to be invaded (but narrow space), '7' same as '6' (but a wider space so an easier invasion), '8' invasion possible (though 'A' is weak and could get weaker, but also is a more narrow space)
3. weight interesting areas against each other (check desires) -> move at '1'-area would be defending but gote, invasion at '6' may be hard (because narrow space and we want it to be as easy as possible), '7' invasion there reduces bottom and denies B to get a huge bottom (proverb: "play where the other wants to play") and it would serve as large-scaled separation of the W left and right side., '8' harder invasion because less space and may hurt 'A'

=> so '6' and '8' is least interesting, '1' is as wide as '7' but is ending gote (so only one-purpose)
area '7' is fulfilling three purposes: invasion (reduce bottom), deny W bottom (may have impact on right stones 'H' too), "separate" W and it's an easier invasion because more space. Therefore engaging in area '7' should be done.
Then you look for a move to accomplish an invasion.]
(;B[dh]LB[lf:D][cq:C][dq:B][fq:A]C[JUG: this looks big, but the W bottom is bigger, if W gets another move there. If W chooses to save his 'D'-group, which is possible in my opinion, the game is in favour of W.

So besides attacking Ws dragon first (which need to end in sente to be able to invade the bottom), NOW could be the right time to invade the bottom, for example starting with one of 'AB' (see vars before).

An invasion at 'C' is possible too (see var before), but B can live there only with a ko (needing ko-threats).
So as long as there are easier (and wider) places for an invasion, keep it simple and invade there. I would invade at 'A' now instead.

In general it's always good to make reviews by yourself or with stronger players for each of your games, at least the games you lost. When trying out variations, also think of the best answers by the opponent. It will do you no good, if you think of variations where your "opponent" makes moves you want him to make. Search for the best move you can think of for both sides!]
;W[fq]LB[le:B][cq:A]C[JUG: B can still invade at 'A' and live with a ko (like shown before)

This was not good by W, better to take 'B' now to escape with his big dragon.]
;B[le]LB[me:A][oe:B][hq:C][jq:F][lq:E][jr:D]C[JUG: your 'A'-stone was indeed very weak, so this was excellent because it put an enormous pressure on the W group 'B'. B most propably ends in sente by Ws chasing, so can still invade the bottom at one of 'CDEF'.]
;W[lg]C[JUG: W shows his intent to save his group, but B now is strong around. It would be very difficult for W to run to safety or make two eyes.]

(;B[hd]LB[id:A]C[JUG: A leaning attack may be the right idea, though it is a bit too early. If here, 'A' would make a better way (see var before), because W may choose to jump out. I would prefer an attack as shown at var at move #37.]
;W[hc]
(;B[je]C[JUG: you should put some more pressure on the top group (see var before).
As mentioned before, such a sequence ends gote, it also leaves 'A' weaker (B touched, W touched back, but B ignored).]
;W[lj]TR[og][oh][oi]C[JUG: this wide jump is a mistake so close to Bs thickness]

(;B[lh]LB[li:A]C[JUG: Ws jump was indeed too far, so this is good, though 'A' may be better, because it doesn't allow W to use the weakness of the single-stone against it (see var before)]
;W[kg]
(;B[ki]LB[kh:A]C[JUG: 'A' should be better (see var before)]
;W[kh]C[JUG: this is now sente, so B allowed W to get a move in sente (for free)]
;B[li];W[ig]
(;B[ih]C[JUG: with single stones keep away from stronger structures, B is helping W with it.
Better to surround from the distance, so that if W approaches you can make yourself strong more easily.]
;W[hg]LB[ih:A]C[JUG: Bs 'A'-move also makes W walk ahead (and B behind), which is not good]
;B[hh];W[gg]
(;B[gh]LB[je:A][ih:B]C[bad direction..?

JUG: yes, when you get strong on one side, the other gets strong on the other side too.

In general, if you have one group running between two other (also weak groups) it's normally good, because if opponent attacks from one side it strengthens the inbetween group, which make the other group weaker. That's because there are two sides that must be attended too and you have only one move to help one side.

Though that's not the case here, B is not weak around and W is the one on high pressure, but G12 was indeed not so good, because it denies the fact, that B now has an inner group as well ('A') that looks weaker now as W got stronger while Bs outside group attacks.
Also locally this move is not good, because B is walking behind (sequence initiated with 'B'). To attack you should drive the direction of play.]
;W[gd]
(;B[he]LB[ge:A]C[JUG: no, B still has a chance to cut with 'A', though that need some reading (see var before)]
;W[ge]LB[jk:A][co:E][hq:B][jq:C][lq:D][jr:F]C[JUG: W connected now

vars are: 'A' (game-move), 'C' (showing invasion principle), 'BCDEF' (invasion examples)]

(;B[jk]LB[db:D][gd:E][dk:H][ml:K][om:G][dn:J][co:B][hq:F][jq:C]
[lq:A][jr:M]TR[dc][gc][hc][ge]C[JUG: this is too small now after W saved his group; making center-area would end up too small. W can reduce that easily with a move on 'G' followed by a move on 'K', or 'H' aiming for a light reduction (see next vars).

Also because now W is strong at 'D', he may also invade the top left corner (at 'D' for example).

B has to invade the bottom now or Ws bottom will become too big. Also the bottom is completly closed. There are some gaps, that can be exploited. Another way to look for places to invade is, to check, if you already have nearby stones that help (for example C9, see 'B'-invasion first).

An invasion at one of 'ABCFM' is possible (check with AREA-SCHEMA which is best). A principle to follow for invading is explained for move 'C' (see vars before).
I've included some examples, but don't consider those as the best available answers. It's only to get you some ideas how it could work.

There are two ways to reduce the other:
1. with a deep invasions (trying to live locally, get a foothold and escape lightly to safety) or
2. a reduction (for example B at 'J' would be one). The problem is, that a reduction would be not enough to stay ahead and also ends gote. 

As long as there is enough space, an invasion should be tried. When do to what, comes with experience (counting could help in that decision: when you are comfortably ahead, a reduction may be sufficient; if you are largely behind then the only chance to close the gap is to invade, because that normally inflicts a greater damage than a reduction.]

(;W[nd]LB[lb:B][lc:A]C[JUG: bad for W, better to come from the left at 'A' or 'B']

(;W[mc]C[JUG: this does not work (W has to few liberties)];B[lc]
C[JUG: good];W[mb];B[lb];W[kd]LB[mc:A]C[JUG: this requires some reading, but there should be no danger for B, because B can capture the W 'A'-group to connect. In fact this move is a big mistake by W.]

(;B[jd]C[JUG: this is missing a chance and helps W (see var before)]

(;W[kc];B[ke]LB[jg:A]C[JUG: you should be aware that after this move, B can cut with 'A' to capture a good bunch of the W stones (was also explained in one the previous variations)]
;W[eb];B[db]LB[jg:A]C[JUG: good locally, but 'A' is still bigger (it's worth about 34 points). Even loosing the top left corner is smaller than such a big capture. Both players missed it till the end of the game.]
;W[ee];B[fb]LB[jg:A]TR[pe][nf][pf][lg]C[JUG: the cut at 'A' would capture the marked group, so B missed a chance for an easy win.

It's always good to be aware of weaknesses (own and others) ready to deploy an attack.
After each move evaluate if the position has changed. THE-LIST with the 3 questions would have helped to detect such weaknesses, because you are systematically looking, if yours or opponents groups are ok.

When one play by intuition alone, one often misses such chances.
From now on you should ignore almost any move by W and immediately cut at 'A' instead. This is not mentioned any further.

F18 normally is a reduction move for the endgame (which ends gote by the way), though here it may be ok, because it threatens the W group.]
;W[ec]LB[fb:A][gb:B]C[And now is the time to invade lower side... but again, what is the proper way?

JUG: W should answer with 'B', then 'A" ends gote.

JUG: summary:

B showed good attacking skills and the awareness of own and opponent weaknesses to a certain limit.
The way to attack was a bit flawed though as you described yourself: B should attack opponents base first, strive to find multi-purpose moves to attack and build strength to attack or build territory at the same time.

The game was in favour for B until the big W dragon ('A') managed to connect. After that the W bottom got too big and B fall behind in territory. An invasion was inevitable to keep up. Tactics for invasions come with experience trying it out in your future games (also see below).

The key of this game was to properly use the attack on Ws center-dragon (W was very careless with it) and to invade Ws bottom before too late.

Advice:
- Good reading skills are important, not only to kill groups, but also to check if oneself is alife ('B', 'C') or other can be cut successfully ('D'). Improve your reading by solving life & death problems (also with some emphasis on cutting): good books are "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 1-3" by Kano Yoshinori(9p), http://goproblems.com/, or the go problems at http://gobase.org/studying/problems/academy/ (you'll need an account for this one)

- Reading is also good to check, wether some sequences are good or not (removing or placing aji-stones): 'EFG'

- Try to train a higher awareness of your own and opponents weaknesses

- Try applying THE-LIST and the AREA-SCHEMA at least at some of the moves in your games. Best if you apply it on each and every move (you then never have weak groups and don't overlook, when the opponent will get too big areas). Furthermore that's the tool to find multi-purpose moves.

- As a general advice i recommend that you review all of your games (at least those that you lost): try to find better moves, where you messed up, alternatives play (also looking out for the best answers of your opponent). If you see that a move does not work, it's makes you a better player not even to try it and hoping for opponents mistake. And if you don't understand what was going on in one of your games, get some help from stronger players (get us GTL-reviewers something to do ;-)

- Finally, to get experience with invasions, or in general with every new concept in go, you should play games not to win or loose, but to learn something. Stay emotionally detached and try out invasions or other things to get a feeling for it and get more experience with it, then make a review afterwards. Don't play too fast and think about every move, even it looks obvious. There may be even better moves.

Hope that review was of some help.

Have fun with this wonderful game!

Cheers,

---
invasions are done using a simple schema:
1. if you can live or be healthy with one gote move -> play it and live; if not
2. play a sente move or escape, that gives support to make a healthy group, then for next move start over with item (1); a group is healthy if it can't be attacked easily (though not necessary to have two eyes).

Capturing the enclosed stones is worth about 20 points, if W gets two big moves as compensation (one worth 10-15 points) somewhere else:('C' and C11), then W could still get ahead. The game would be still playable for both, though i think W has the better position (after resolving the 'B'-stone, B must invade the bottom).]

(;AE[me]CR[oe]LB[dc:A][gc:C][pd:B][pe:D][qg:F][pj:E]C[JUG: this is the same position as on move #14 (removed the last move for better explanations)

There is a simple list of items you should execute on each of your moves (in the remaining review i refer to it as THE-LIST):

On each move, you ask yourself 3 questions. The answer to those questions gives you the objective for the move to find, but don't look for certain moves yet, look for ideas:

1. am I ok ? - are my groups alive / stable / strong, or can they be hassled. A group cannot be "hassled", when an opponents attack on this group does not need an answer to make it safe, but can be ignored (your opponent has no sente-move against your group). Then this group is "healthy".
If one of your groups is not ok (i.e. unhealthy) => defend it to make it healthy (that does not necessarily mean it is still living, but it can't be hassled).
if all groups ok, proceed with next question

2. is the other ok ? - which groups are weak, which are stable, can they be hassled ?
If one or more groups are weak => attack them (maybe there are areas you can play to attack more than one group at once or also help other own groups).
if all groups ok, proceed with next question

3. is there an undecided area ? - that's an area that is not finished and surrounded, which can be invaded or reduced.
if there is such an area => engage there

---
Example with this position (W played P15, B to play):

1. am i ok ? mark all your groups (single-stones normally don't count as groups) -> 'A' and 'B' group are ok

2. is other ok ? mark all W groups ->
-> 'C' (ok: can't be hassled, because W still has M17 or can escape to center)
-> 'D' (weak, not settled yet)
=> the objective is to 'attack 'D'-group"

then ask yourself if you can attack 'D' and at the same time help other of your stones & groups.
Are there own groups/stones in 'D's vicinity that can help or can be helped ? yes -> 'E'-group/stones is near
Are there other opponent groups that can be attacked ? -> no
Those questions are the key to fulfill more than one purpose with a move.

After you selected an objective, you search for a proper move, that fulfills the goals -> 'F' would be such a move.

Applying the AREA-SCHEMA would also reveal the right side as best to play, because B can get a move like 'F' in sente.

THE-LIST and the AREA-SCHEMA should be used for every move. It's a great help in deciding where to play (not the exact move, but the area). Then you can search for interesting moves to engage there. Which move to choose is a matter of experience and your own style. Your experience is going to increase with every game you play.]
))
(;B[qg]LB[pj:A]C[?

JUG: yes, this is a much better idea:
Take away the base of Ws group (base = a fundament to build a living group).

This is a good move not only because it attacks W, but it also makes a base (gives support) for the 'A'-stone.
So this is a double-purpose-move.

You should always strive to find multi-purpose-moves. If one "purpose" is nullified by Ws answer, the other "purpose(s)" still give you some profit or advantage.]

;B[on]LB[lc:A][me:E][qe:C][rf:B][ql:D][fq:F]C[JUG: this is a better order of moves, it also protects against an easy invasion at 'D'. Ws 'E'-group is not completly save yet, and look who made all the points this time.
On top, B has miai 'ABC' to make the corner alive or connect.

If W now chooses to connect his 'E'-group, B gets sente. And if W tenuki (play somewhere else, e.g. at 'F'), B can go on with an attack on 'E'.]
