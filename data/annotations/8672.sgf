C[Hi];B[ld];W[ll];B[dd];W[dl];B[hd];W[mc]C[Hi,

I am the review, Joachm Neumann. l review the moves of white (Jonathan Wilson). 

N13 is a bit too early. At this stage, the terretory is not maked yet. Better play around M8, D8 or H4. If black attacks N13, white can live in the corner, but black gets a very strong ourside wall, which will help him to make a lot of points on both sides.]
;B[lc];W[md];B[me];W[mg]C[This is too far away. If black would anser O11, the two white stones N13 and N12 would (probably) be lost. The standard play would be M14.]
;B[dj];W[dh]C[Very agressive, not not wrong.];B[ck];W[cl]C[ok]
;B[ci];W[di]C[The group D8 is very weak. It can survice, but while struggling for survival, it will bale black very stong (with the stones that attack this group. As a beginner, a good lesson to learn is to sometimes give up a stone. 
Another important rule is to keep ones stomes connected. If you try to live, a better play would have been C8.]
;B[bk];W[bl]C[good];B[al];W[am];B[ak];W[dk]C[Uhh. very bad. Black can now play B3 and take the corner. You were lucky, he didn't do that.]
;B[ej];W[bn];B[ch];W[fg];B[dg];W[eg]C[A week defence. Black shows the weaknbess of this move in his answer.]
;B[eh]C[You should better give up the stones D8 and D7. This stone (a) adds a prisoer for black and allows him to play F7.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[ef]C[If you want to help your E9 stones, better try connecting to N9, e.g., by playing at J9.]

;B[bf];W[bd];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[cb];B[dc];W[bb];B[ac]C[These corner things can be difficult as a beginner. Playing many games helps...]
;W[aa];B[ca];W[ab];B[ba];W[bc]C[Why didn't you play D15? You might still have lost the corner, but the fight would be more open.]
;B[ac];W[fh];B[hg]C[Now, black did, what I recommended to you earlier. The important link between the F9 group and the closest white stones (N9) is not blocked.]

;W[fn]C[Well played!];B[io];W[go];B[mb];W[nd];B[ne];W[nb];B[ma]
;W[lf]C[too timit. cut ar M11! The outcome is unclear, but your position would be better to link N9 and the N12 group.]
;B[lb];W[oe];B[of];W[od];B[oc];W[nf];B[le]C[Huge mistake by blck. He could have taken with O13. Lucky you,]
;W[og];B[mf];W[lg];B[nh];W[ng];B[kg];W[kf]C[wrong side. better play at L8 to defend. Your position is not strong enough. If you had two eyes in the N12 group, this more agressive side would be ok.]

;W[nj];B[mh];W[ob]C[Nicely played. You have two eyes and blacks attack from the L6 group are now your prisoners!]

;B[nn];W[on];B[kn];W[no];B[mo];W[mn];B[jn];W[lo]C[Well defended until this move. You shgould have taken the three stones with H1.]
;B[jm];W[jl];B[im];W[km]C[life and death fight. L1 would have killed the blck group. But don't worry too much, these things are a bit tricky and you will learn them with time.]
;B[ko];W[mo];B[ho];W[fo];B[dm];W[cm];B[dn];W[cn];B[tt];W[gb]
C[Very brave! Normally, you should not be able to survice, but as a beginner, it is a good excercise.]
;B[hb];W[gc];B[ic];W[ea];B[fb];W[fc];B[eb];W[ia];B[tt]C[Editor's note:  The scoring is disputed here, so play continues.]

;W[kb];B[la]C[huuh. you were lucky. Blck should have played K13 to survice and kill all your stones in the top of the board.]
