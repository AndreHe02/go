RR  This review will be focused on the black players moves.]
;B[qp]C[sumioshi [10k\]: hello
Deagle02 [12k\]: hello];W[cc];B[pd];W[dq];B[qj]TR[oq]C[RR:  Nice opening by black.  I would rather enclose the bottom corner (marked triangle) than extend along the edge.  This is close to the Chinese opening, which black may want to read up on if black likes to build up early Moyo.]
;W[dn];B[ce]TR[oq][op]C[RR:  I think this is black's first mistake.  Black still has the lower right corner to seal off.  If black plays at one of the marked spots, then black has a HUGE moyo on the right side.  I think it is too early to attack the white stone on the upper left.  Think about making the black stronger, instead of making the white stones weaker.]
;W[fd];B[dd]TR[ch]C[RR:  I have a more passive style of play, but I think that black is being over aggresive here.  This peep will only make white stronger, while black gains very little.  A simple 2 point extension along the left is where I would play.]
;W[dc];B[ci]TR[ch]C[RR:  This might be 1 point too far of an extension.  I know the rule, extend 3 points from a wall 2 stones high, but I don't think that the D-16 stone can count towards that wall, white is too strong.]
;W[ck]C[variation]
(;B[eh]C[RR:  I have talked about the other variations already.  I like the E11 move better.  This move doesn't put enough pressure on white down below, but other than that, it makes the black stones feel more connected, with less points to peep.]
;W[op]C[RR:  This is a good move for white.];B[oq]TR[mp]C[RR:    Black should read the book about the chinese opening.  Because black is strong on the right hand side, black needs to force white to play up and on the right side.  A pincer at about N4 would force white to jump into the middle.]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[on]C[RR:  White gets a great result.  A large Moyo on the bottom side.  Black gets about 9 points of territory in the corner, and not much room for expansion along the side.]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[lq]C[RR:  Good.  A nice 2 point jump on the 3rd line.  This is a good position to try and live in white's moyo.]
;W[mp]C[variation]
(;B[lp]TR[ko]C[RR:  I have looked at the variation, and I do like this move, maybe as the best move.  A light jump to L5 would be appropriate too.]
;W[qm];B[qg]TR[oj]C[RR:  I like the 1 point jump into the center, keeping pressure on the white group.  This would also build a wall towards the Black Q16 stone.]
;W[nc];B[kc]C[RR:  This move is good for two reasons.  #1.  It pincers the lone white stone.  #2, it takes away territory from the stones on the upper left.]

TR[qe]C[RR:  I think the atari is the right move here.];W[lh]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[jh];W[lj];B[in];W[nr]C[question variation point]

(;B[pr]C[RR:  Ugly empty triangle.  I imagine that this life & death problem has many different variations.  Trying to read them all out here is out of my knowledge.  This move seems safe for living, leaving very little weaknesses.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[ln];B[kn];W[lm]C[situation variation point]
(;B[mq]TR[lr]C[RR:  This move doesn't attack white, and doesn't make any eyes.  Playing down onto the 2nd line would be the best to make eyes.  The white group seems very safe.]
;W[gn];B[ed];W[ec];B[dl];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[gl]TR[dk]C[RR:  I think I would back up one spot to stay connected to the top stones.  White will be able to snake into the black area on the left, and take away black points.]
;W[dk];B[fm];W[fn];B[fl];W[fj];B[ff]TR[ek]C[RR:  It would be a good idea to cut white here at E9.]

C[white jumps into the corner...  should i have been able to protect this earlier and is there a way to kill white now???

RR:  See earlier comment about playing Q15 stone at R15.  White would have a harder time living here.  White does have a weakness at O16.  If black reinforces the P17 stone, then cutting at O16 would be big.]

;W[md];B[ld];W[mf];B[oa];W[qb]C[is there a cutting point for black here in the O15 area to kill whites stones

RR:  I don't see one.  White is very well connected.  Could have cut the white stones for a long time.  Now it is too late.  See variation #4 for one possible line of play.]

(;B[gp]C[it seems a bigger move now instead of N3 would be to get into this bottom left corner...

What is the best way to do this??? it seems vulnerable and possible big white territory (later on I get fortunate and reduce it a bit but I think now is a good time.

RR:  My weakness is locating invading points that you are asking for.  White has 3 stones on the corner, with 2 stones on the 3rd line.  Very difficult to invade.  The best thing to do is to look at the move you want to make (G4) and then start some sort of criss-cross fight, in order to play point in sente]

RR:  I hate triangles too.  But here it might be the right move.  Black is trapped in the corner, and needs to make eyes.]

RR:  Hard to say which is better.  It almost looks like a white move at J7 would cap the whole black group.  (Maybe not, but it feels that way.)]

(;B[ei]C[This variation seems more vulnarable to black from white F16...  this is my thinking on Black E12.

RR:  This is my favorite move.  It is very secure, and I don't think it is over concentrated.  White is strong on both sides, so a secure move is best.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[ed]TR[kc]C[RR:  Black gets a fair result.  Blacks move needs to be on the top side to reduce white moyo.]
