C[g: I don't think I played too badly in this game, despite losing. I wonder where I really lost it though? I don't think the endgame went too well for black, so perhaps it was there.

Any and all comments appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Note from reviewer:

It's a bit strange to review a game for someone with almost equal strength. However, I'll do it. If you are not satisfied, you could request another review.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po];B[pl];W[mo]C[Does not look good to me. But I will not comment on this.]
;B[mq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[jq]C[g: maybe this wasn't such a good idea for black.

Bad move. Does neither secure the black position, nor attach the white one. Also too narrow.]
;W[or]C[g: because of this, which I hadn't thought of]

(;B[io]C[g: I pulled out the k3 group because it was open on the bottom edge, but perhaps k5 would have been better given white's next move?

Obviously this gains nothing. The white group is secure and cannot be attacked.

See the variations for alternatives.];W[hq]C[g: but white got this move in

Good.];B[ko]C[You cannot win like this. This secures the cut too directly and narrow.]
;W[od]C[White should take the remaining corner.]
(;B[pf]C[This is not good.  The left side is from below and will not yield territorry for Black.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[rn];B[rp];W[qk]C[While this looks too early. White should first secure the stone on the top. Or take the last corner.]
;B[dd];W[qh]
(;B[rb]C[g: I played this to try & ensure life for the top right black group whilst taking away white's base ( he hadn't finished off the joseki, either)

You could also attack from the left.];W[kc]C[Too far out.];B[dj]
;W[fc]C[g: is white a bit too spread out along the top? I seem to have potential invasion points at H/J17 &  N17 if necessary

No, the F17 L17 relation is OK. F17 can either jump to the middle or into the corner.]
;B[fe]C[g: helps white to protect his top, but I played it with the hope of forming something in the centre.]
;W[hd];B[cn];W[cp];B[en]C[At this point there are probably numerous mistakes. It is certainly a decisive phase of the game. But it takes a stronger player than me to pinpoint the correct alternatives.

If you look at that game, White did not do well here because the Black stones in the lower side suddenly start to make sense again.]
;W[fo]C[Obviously, White is feeling the same and tries to switch in between the lower side and the right.]

C[g: I thought I had only one eye at the bottom edge, so wanted to connect my black group to the top right without white reinforcing the n17 weakness.

This does not connect. The group below should have no problems to from two eyes.]

(;B[dg]C[g: I played here because I felt there will still weaknesses in my position surrounding the white centre group, and didn't want to risk anything.

You could secure by attacking. This move could easily be the loosing move.]

(;B[cc]C[g: bad move?

Yes.];W[dc];B[ed];W[db];B[ch];W[ek]C[White needs to play in the upper left corner.]
