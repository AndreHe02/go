C[Game reviewed by Vince Suttle v.suttle@btinternet.com, 8k on IGS. Comments were made using theWinIGC program. The review was requested by Grumm.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[jd];B[dj];W[pj];B[cf]C[No problems so far.]
;W[df]C[Professionals don't like the attach and extend joseki , when played with the sanren-sei ( a row of three stones all on the star points), as it gives the other player a good position on the side. This is especially true with the black stone at D10. The normal move for white would be F16.]

(;B[cg]C[This was too timid. It is too low, see the variation for one common alternative]
;W[ce];B[be]C[This was too small a move for this stage of the game. There are other moves which are worth far more.]
;W[bd];B[bf]C[Think, what have you gained from your last two moves? White has strengthened his corner and has sente (the initiative, he doesn't have to answer your move). But what have you gained ? Not a lot!

You could have ignored whites last move. If he plays where you did he only catches one stone. At this stage it isn't worth saving.]
;W[qn]LB[pl:a]C[Think of the difference between this position and black "a"  instead of your last move.]
;B[qp]LB[np:a]C[I didn't like this move. It looks too much like you are trying too hard to keep the corner. If you want to be sure of keeping the corner, don't play the star point, which is more aimed at outside influence. I would have played at "a" instead.]
;W[on];B[nc]LB[np:a][nn:b][mn:c]C[Er, a difficult choice, I would have liked to have defended the bottom right corner at "a" but whites framework is getting big. If you had played "a" on the last move, you would have had the option of playing at "b" or "c" expanding your framework while holding whites down.]
;W[pf];B[kc]C[I would probably have played Q18 first.];W[jc]
;B[kd];W[nq]C[Black has got problems now.];B[no]C[I don't like this move it looks too easy on white. I would have tried O4.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[kq];B[jq];W[kr];B[jr]C[An understandable move as omitting it leaves a how for white to come through, but black is letting white push him around.]
;W[pr]C[Whites stones are fairly secure now and never.];B[oq]
;W[or];B[kp]LB[pb:a][qc:b][lo:c]C[The black stones in the corner are looking weak, they need some help. And the group at the top could do with some as well. How about black  "a", white "b" then black "c", trying to shut white in at the bottom, and helping to bring the black stones out.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[lp];B[mn]LB[ol:a][pl:b]C[Whites two stones  to the right look like a better target to me. Perhaps a play at "a" or "b"]
;W[ln];B[om];W[pm];B[pn];W[pl];B[ol];W[qm];B[ko]LB[pb:a][qc:b]
[km:c][jm:d][qo:e][qr:f]C[It doesn't do enough.   I might have tried black "a" to strengthen the top group, if then white "b", black "c" or "d" helps to build blacks framework. Black group in the bottom right can live easily with "e" or "f" if necessary.]
;W[lo];B[ok]LB[km:a][kl:b]C[These moves look too slow for my liking. Something like "a" or "b" would be better.]
;W[qi];B[pk];W[qk];B[cm]C[C4 would have been better.];W[cq]
LB[cp:a][dq:b]C[This is the problem with the last move. It didn't stop white playing here. Which is the best "a or "b"? I'm not sure, see the variation for one posible continuation.]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[fr];W[dr]
;B[gl]LB[jl:a][kl:b]C[No, if you want to expand your territory here then a move such as"a" or "b" would do a better job. But be careful, there is some weak points in blacks wall.]
;W[jf]C[Notice how whites move expands his framework and puts some pressure on blacks stones.]
;B[kf];W[ke];B[le];W[je];B[lf];W[im];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm];W[in]
;B[ho];W[ci];B[di];W[dh];B[ch]LB[dg:a][eg:b][eh:c][ef:d]C[Black could have tried the more aggresive play at "a". If white "b" then there are the cutting points at "c" and "d".]
;W[dg];B[ei]LB[gi:a]C[Again too small, If you want to play around here then somethng like a would be better.]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[lm]LB[km:a]C[Black "a" would have been better as it would have kept the 3 white stones separated. White might be able to save them but at least black should get a few points for his group while attacking them.]
;W[kn];B[km];W[ni];B[li];W[pb]C[Think what a difference a black play here would have made. White would almost certainly answered by playing at R17.]
;B[oe];W[pe];B[of]LB[hh:a][jn:b]C[Again a bit slow although black does need to keep an eye on this group. I would have tried something like black "a" aiming to play "b" afterwards.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[oh];B[mj];W[gh];B[gi];W[fc]C[This is a very big corner for white.]
;B[jn];W[jm];B[jo];W[ji]C[Now you can see the reason behind the prepatory move suggested a couple of moves back.]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[jk];W[ii];B[hj];W[kk];B[jl];W[lj];B[lk];W[kj]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[ik];W[ep];B[eo]LB[do:a]C["a" would have been better, the continuation shows why.]

;W[ic];B[oc];W[pc];B[an];W[ap];B[kg];W[mi];B[nj];W[mg];B[mf]
;W[ma]C[The variation shows one way to deal with the so called "monkey-jump".]

(;B[ob];W[oa];B[lc];W[jg];B[ja];W[rq]LB[qr:a][lq:b]C[Think what a difference a black play at "a" would have made, especially as white has the weak spot at "b". See the variation.]

(;B[po]C[There was no need to play here. There is an eye at P6.]
;W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[mb]LB[ia:a][lq:b][rp:c][ad:d]C[This doesn't do much. There are better points such as "a", "b", "c" or "d".]
;W[na];B[od];W[mq];B[la]C[You need to try and find moves which your opponent must answer. ie try to keep sente.]

;W[hh];B[lg];W[ki];B[mh];W[li];B[nh];W[op];B[qo];W[ro];B[ks]
;W[ls];B[js];W[lr];B[es];W[ds];B[fs];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[tt]
C[Not a good idea !];W[bi]C[Oops];B[bh];W[ag];B[ai];W[bg]LB[aj:a]
C[The wrong move. White "a" instead would have killed eight black stones.]
;B[ah];W[aj];B[bj];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt]C[The main problem here is that you let white dicate the game. You never really seemed to threaten white much at all.   Too many of your moves were either too small, unnecessary or helped white.   You nearly alway seem to give ground when your opponent attacks, try to look for ways to counter-attack. You need to try and take the fight to your opponent a bit more.

I really think you would benfit from reading a couple of good books on general tactics and life and death.]

(;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd]C[From here the normal joseki move is to  extend down the side of the board to C10. However black already has a stone at D10, so this joseki is very good for black. It helps black to build up his framework.]
