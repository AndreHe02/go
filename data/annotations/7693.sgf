C[please see the end for general comments. any moves i suggest are because of my humble understanding of the game. stronger players will make likely make better suggestions.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd]C[white usually plays around the last corner before approaching the middle.]
;W[jj];B[kj]C[it would be more advantageous for black to take the last corner.]
;W[ki];B[li];W[lj]C[with the board so open at this stage, putting black in atari is only making black stronger. black can run out with L9 and be safe for a few more moves. white should consider playing more solidly like around K11.]
;B[kk];W[lh];B[mi]
(;W[mj]C[white should try K12 instead. black would then capture white's stone with N9.]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[oj];W[oi]C[white's move is N8. there are many cutting points among the K10, L11, and M12 stones.]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[pj]C[black should play something like O12 instead to escape. white can capture the three stones with O12.]
;W[qj]C[better for white to capture black's three stones with O12.]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[pg];W[qh];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[qk];B[pk];W[nh]
;B[og];W[rk];B[rl]C[ineffective. black should play elsewhere or cut the K10, L11, and M12 stones.]
;W[sj];B[pe];W[si]C[to capture these three stones was unnecessary. black had no chance of living there. a better response would be R16 or R15.]
;B[qd]C[the idea is good. however, black should play around P16 and force white in the other direction because black would then have somewhat of a wall facing the left side. with this move, white moves towards the left.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[nd];B[ne]C[better for black to play R17 in this case.]
;W[md];B[me];W[mh]C[it was unnecessary for white to capture these three stones. white could instead continue with R17 and take the corner.]
;B[ld];W[pc]C[this move is not efficient. M17 is much better. note that with white at M17, black cannot cut at N17 because of shicho.]
;B[pb]C[R17 is better.];W[qc];B[rc]
(;W[qe]C[white at S16, black R15, white S18 is a good sequence.]
;B[rd];W[rb];B[qb];W[re];B[sb];W[ra];B[qa];W[sc];B[sa];W[sd]
C[this move is the result of a lack of mindfulness.];B[se];W[qf]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[mc];W[nc]C[white should have played elsewhere; perhaps kakari any of black's stones on the left side.]
;B[nb];W[mb]C[wishful thinking?];B[lc];W[ob];B[oc];W[pf];B[of]
;W[sf]C[better for white to connect at S14.];B[rf];W[sg]C[one stone is insignificant at this time. white should have considered playing elsewhere.]
(;B[pp]C[good point. D10 works too.];W[pl]
(;B[qm]C[given the strength of white's stones in that area, black could also consider something like R5 or R4.]
;W[ok];B[pm];W[pk]C[filling in one's territory is not effective in some cases...]
;B[nl]C[what a brave stone! it is very close to white's strength. black could consider something around O4.]
(;W[nk]C[this cut does not need to be protected. white should use this living group to attack black's structure.]
;B[ml];W[kl];B[ll];W[jk];B[lk];W[lm]C[locally, this leaves too many cutting points for black. white should focus on the left side.]
;B[mm];W[mn]C[more cutting points.];B[km]
(;W[nm]C[white should play K8 to make somewhat of a wall facing the left side; this wall could be used to attack later]
;B[ln];W[jl]C[black should play elsewhere. consider what would happen if white were to connect at O6.]
(;B[nn];W[ol];B[om];W[mo];B[lp];W[mk];B[mp];W[no];B[oo];W[np]
;B[nq];W[kn];B[jn];W[ko];B[lo];W[jm];B[lm];W[kp];B[kq]
(;W[mq]C[white should have played elsewhere.]
(;B[op]C[it was unnecessary for black to capture these stones.]
;W[jq]C[white should have played at J5.];B[jp];W[ip];B[jo]
(;W[ee]C[what about the two bottom stones!? if you play stones, use them. otherwise, it means those stones that were played were useless and ineffectual.]
(;B[fe]C[D15 or E16 is better.];W[ed]C[now black's two stones don't work so well with white's tachi.]
;B[ec];W[dc]C[excellent (locally).];B[fc];W[de];B[cd]
(;W[cc]C[white should try the other side to build a wall.];B[ce]
;W[cf]
(;B[be];W[bf];B[af]C[black should have played elsewhere.];W[bd]
;B[ae]C[more wishful thinking?];W[ag];B[dj]C[good point.]
(;W[ad]C[unnecessary for white to capture those stones. white should have played elsewhere.]
;B[hl]C[too close to white's wall.]
(;W[dh]C[the idea is good, however it could have been better applied with something around D8. since white has a lot of strength in the upper left, the power could be projected further.]
;B[fj];W[io];B[in]
(;W[ho]C[this move is not as efficient as something like G5.]
;B[hn];W[gn];B[go];W[gp];B[fo];W[fp];B[fn]
(;W[gm]C[white should not nobi in this case since there is no reinforcements nearby.]
;B[iq];W[hp];B[fl]C[a good thought but unnecessary; white cannot escape.]
;W[hm];B[im];W[il];B[gl];W[fm]C[silly.];B[em];W[jr];B[ir]
(;W[is]C[better at H2.];B[hs];W[js];B[kr];W[hr];B[ks];W[hq]

[sh]C[this game is nowhere near what is possible for both players. your potential exceeds what was demonstrated in this game. 

self atari and wishful thinking should be avoided. if you wouldn't play a certain way yourself, you should not expect your opponent to do so. 

in the opening, spread out your stones. like the world, the board is vast and large. there is much to be learned everywhere. do not merely explore what is within sight.

"walls" are strong and could be used to attack. once a group is alive, do not hesitate to use it to attack the enemy. living groups are invincible.]
