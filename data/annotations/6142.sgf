C[bbnoonan [12k\]: hello
Matil [12k\]: hi
Matil [12k\]: good game

Hi, I've played go for about 1 year. The things that I'm
still confused about are the beginning and reading.
Something that I also find difficult is counting, and
thereby deciding where to move in the endgame.

I would apprectiate it if you pointed out what I could
improve and how I could do this. Thanks in advance
for helping me be reviewing this game.

If you could also give some general comments on
white's play I'd like that. That should show me
what I myself can think about during the game.

I think my largest mistake was move 199 that lead
to me losing a lot of points.

> Hi, I'm tom.  For most of the game you played fairly well.  If not for some late-game mistakes you would have won most likely.    I'll try to point out what I can.  Actually, 199 was bad, but 201 was worse, since it was your chance to save yourself and prevent massive reduction.]

In the early game, try to spread out wide and play in big open spaces.  moves like Q5, R5, C15, D15 work well with your corner enclosures and and claim big space.  E and F are also good for the same reason.]

;B[im]LB[id:B][ke:C][hg:A]C[Too small.  For every move you make, ask yourself two questions: how many points does this play give me?  Is it sente?  This is a gote play to protect a 16-20 point moyo for you.  On top black and white are both threatening to make 50 point moyos.  A play like H13 or even J16 is huge.  Even the safer L15 is a much stronger play, since it's sente and protects big points.]

;W[in]C[The best thing to do is close off at H7.

This is the sort of ko that is worth much more to white than black.  When white takes H7, it is a very sente play: it threatens to destroy 15-20 points worth of territory for black (which is exactly what happens).  So you can only fight this ko if you have a ko threat that does at least 20 points of damage.  There really isn't anything like that for you.  The closest is probably C17, threatening to live in the corner.]
