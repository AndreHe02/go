C[Hi! Fist of all I want to thank you to help me improve my games by commenting one game of mine.

I chose to send this because it was for a tournament and the time was 10:15.

I took white and I tought i was going to loose worst beacuse of his rank.

I hope you'll understand my english

****  all of my comments will have the stars before them.  i am glad to help.  overall, you played a very good game against a strong opponent.  despite the loss, you should be happy with your performance.  that said, there are several places that you could have taken the advantage and possibly won the game.  i will point those out when they arise.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cc];B[oq]C[I've been playing go for 8 months and I still have not choose an open to make on most of my games. I change to try.

This was one of my first times i chose san san, i did not wanted both hoshis been white, or an irregular(3-4,4-5,3-5) just by taste


****  i'm not sure i would have chosen this opening for white.  when black occupies the 3-4 point and white plays the fourth move on the 3-3 point, black almost has to respond by making a shimari.  that gives black a pretty large corner.  the benefit to white is now white has sente.  i am not very familiar with san san openings, so i can't be of much help here.   if i had been playing, i would have played c17 at d17.  that way i could pincher any approach move black makes and hopefully play the approach move in the lower right before black enclosed the corner.  if black still played p3 after i played d17, i would play o17.  white could easily get an even result there that would balance black's shimari.   also, i think if i was black, i would have played the shimari at p4 because of your san san opening.  p4 would be better placed for play in the middle of the board.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe];W[dj]C[***** good balance];B[dd];W[dc]
;B[ed];W[be];B[dg];W[fb];B[cn];W[df];B[ef];W[cf];B[fg];W[ch]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[dh];W[ci];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[jc]C[i did not play D6 because I taught if i did that he'd also have chances to reduce my left territory. I think I was a little inconcius about B5's group safety

**** i think g5 is a better play, especially since black will probably try to escape from the left side.]
;B[dm];W[fm]C[**** i think i would have a tendency to play f10.  that black group around e14 could be attacked later after you chase the d7 stones.  if black responds to f10 by jumping to f7, you can continue pursuing by playing g5 and then aim to play on the bottom and attack the top left group.  f10 is a nice splitting attack.]
;B[el];W[fl];B[ek];W[fi];B[bn];W[ao];B[fk];W[jp]C[Someone told me this mus be played in the 3rd line. What do u think?

*** yes, the third line is much better and gives you the extension to either m3 or h3.  if you have played g5 before, you could play g3 in sente and establish a presence on the lower side that way.]
;B[fp];W[en];B[dn];W[fo];B[go];W[gn];B[ho];W[gk];B[gj]
(;W[hk]C[**** black is going to escape anyway that you play (from what i can see), i would have cut at f10 and captured the g10 stone to give a nice pontuki in the center of the board.  see the variation.]
;B[ej];W[em];B[dk];W[di];B[ei];W[hq];B[gq];W[hn]C[**** i would have played n3 instead.  the f7 group already has access to the center and at least 1 eye, 2 eyes with one more move.  you don't gain much by playing h6, but you would gain with n3.]
;B[io]C[**** i am suprised that black played here instead of m3 or n17.  either one of those moves would give black a pretty large lead.]
;W[mq];B[iq];W[jq];B[ip];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[qq];W[np]C[*** why here?  o17 seems like a much larger point to take.  you also have the reducing move at q7.]
;B[rf];W[mc];B[rh];W[pb]C[**** i would have played p18 i think.  you still need r12 also.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[oc];W[oa];B[qb];W[nk]C[***** i think this is a bad move.   your right side group is in danger and this connection is too easy to break.   i would have played r12.  any wall you build will probably not help too much, but it will keep all of your stones connected.]
;B[pi]C[**** this is a nice move.];W[hj];B[gi];W[hi];B[gh];W[oj]
C[***** you will give black too much territory with this move.  i would have played q9]

C[Wsat about this one? what would you play?

**** i would have played q6.  that group can connect with one of two possible other groups (h10 or o4), or can probably make two eyes in a fight.]
;B[lo];W[gd]C[*** big point];B[im];W[in]C[I didn't want him to play G7 in sente]
;B[jn];W[ng];B[of];W[jl]C[**** with those two walls there, and since it is a close game, i would have cut at k7.]
;B[jm];W[ig]C[**** i think i would have played this at n15.]
