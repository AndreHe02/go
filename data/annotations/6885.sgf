C[Review requested for Black (Googol [8k\] KGS)

I have the following questions for this game:

1) There was a bit of ko fighting with large groups at the stake. I had difficulties with what to save and what to spare. Are there any principles that can ease this mental process a bit?
2) I chased a large white group that - as always! - managed to escape. Were there ways to prevent it from escaping - or chasing big groups is always hopeless?
3) Also, I would appreciate all other comments or remarks you could have.

Thanks!

Llywelyn:

Interesting game.  To address your questions directly:

1) That particular situation should have never become a ko fight. In general, however, some guidelines would be to remain calm, save your ko threats (don't flail when you can't see a way to save your group), and use your local ko threats first.  There were a lot of local ko threats in that group that could have forced W to burn her own threats and maybe open up some potential for you for later.

2) As a general rule you are unlikely to kill an invasion.  Best to think about how to profit from that invasion: is it better to chase them out? Which direction? Can you force them to live small?

General Things to Work On:

* Not playing contact moves.  Contact moves are for situations where you either don't mind or actively want them to get heavier and/or stronger as well.  

* Don't push lost causes.  If you are going to die, abandon it for later--it is amazing what you can do without playing out all of the local potential. 

* Don't depend on ultra-deep invasions.  Reductions frequently are a better choice.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[cd]TR[fc][nc][oc]C[Llywelyn: First mistake.  Black has just ceded too much in the corner.  Any of the marked points are more traditional.]

[ee]C[Llywelyn: Black is pushing from behind while white picks up 4th line territory.  Meanwhile, Black's influence is held in check by A, and his ability to make territory is undermined by B.

White should be very happy with this result.]
(;B[ci]TR[ce][de][ee]C[Llywelyn: Feels very constrained.  The rule of thumb is "number of stones in height + 1" and going out to C10 should be safe here.]

(;W[nf];B[pc];W[oc]C[Llywelyn:  W is basically in control of this game.  She is a little overextended... but not my much.]
;B[jc]LB[jg:E][gh:B][qh:A][qi:C][jq:D]C[Llywelyn: Way too aggressive on B's part.  There isn't a lot of space in there, and W has fairly terrifying influence.  B also has a weakness around A that may come back to haunt him later.  I would--under less urgent circumstances--look at moves around B, C, or D.

E is also becoming really urgent, and is as deep as B should go.

B is a power move that puts a check on W working her way into the center.  It gives B some options both around L17 and around K3.

C protects the weak point and works well with Q4 for a fairly territorial approach.

D is probably too aggressive, but at this point B is a little behind and so an aggressive play may still be the right approach.]

;W[nc]C[Llywelyn: White seems to have changed her mind.  K15 was a strategy aiming at center influence, O17 seems to be aimed at killing.]

(;W[mb]C[Llywelyn: I don't believe this is necessary.  It seems dead even without a move by W.]
;B[lb]C[Llywelyn: waste of ko threats.  As a general rule Black would prefer to save moves that might save the group until there is a ko.]

[np:B]TR[pj]C[Llywelyn: This feels bad for black.   Black wants support at around A for R5 to be a valid option.

The important thing to remember is that a contact play like R5 makes White stronger.  When Black already has an attacking stone in place around Q10 this can be acceptable, but is generally not the best option without a stone there.

The moves that immediately come to mind for me are A, B, and C.  There are probably other moves, but these are fairly regular and are good first moves to evaluate.

A is a powerful move that restricts W's local options.   The two most likely would be diving into the corner or jumping up to P6.  

B emphasizes the southern side  at the cost of the east.  I might play this way i fit were peaceful and I were ahead and didn't have the aji to worry about at R15.  Since that isn't the case here, we'll discard it.

C is a looser version of A and shows more of a concern for R15.   It also works well against K3.]

(;W[qq];B[pq];W[ro];B[pn];W[qp];B[po];W[qm];B[qh];W[pk]C[Llywelyn: W can be satisfied with the result, though the aji at R2 is disconcerting.]
;B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[rj]TR[hq]C[Llywelyn: Entirely too conservative.  Something around H3 is begging to be played and can affect the rest of the game.]
;B[oh]C[Llywelyn: Southern side is huge.];W[mh];B[fq]C[Llywelyn: good.]
;W[er]C[Llywelyn: Weird play on W's part... D3 would have been firmer.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[fr];W[dr]C[Llywelyn: Small.];B[fl];W[jo]TR[db]
[pm][fo]C[Llywelyn: IW is starting to feel behind due to overly conservative play (D2, S10, etc), and so she eschews the more conservative plays (marked) with something that feels little more reckless.

Black at this point needs to figure out how to address K5 more directly and profit from it.  Since killing it seems unlikely, the better question is "how to chase it for profit."  One option would be to solidify Black's south side, another would be to try and grow out more into the center.

As an exercise, sit down and think about how that would flow if your goal isn't to kill, but to gain profit.

Remember, if you attack all out and fail you will be much worse off.  It's like following a broken ladder.]
;B[jm];W[lo]TR[go]C[Llywelyn: The other direction seems more likely to save W.  She should play lightly.]
