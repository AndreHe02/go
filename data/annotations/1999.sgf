C[Dear reviewer.

This is a game that contained plenty of mistakes from both sides
:-). However, we balanced the mistakes nicely, and the whole
thing ended up in a grand semeai, in which I *think* black was
in a better position. The game ended with a silly mistake from
white, but I would still like to hear what the other side should've
done differently. I seem to have problems keeping the opponent
outside my frameworks - I leave too much holes. I would appreciate
it if you would point out these holes to me :-)

I play black (because my opponent insisted on playing with white).

Thanks for the review.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk]C[No, I have no idea how to play low chinese. I just wanted to
try it out.];W[nd]

C[I think this was a mistake. Perhaps I should've just extended
at O14?
RM: Right and wrong. Q18 very bad - almost no meaning. Even if
black follows up with p17 white can tenuki! However o14 does
not look a great alternative - it leaves many cutting opportunities.
 P14 or Q14 are stronger, if a little slow. White can then make
good at the top of the board, but black has the right hand side
and the aji left in M17.];W[oe];B[ob];W[nc];B[pe];W[of];B[pf]
;W[nf];B[ed]C[I did not want white to play here, since the wall to the right
would've been too formidable.

RM: d6 is worth consideration here...];W[cl];B[en];W[fp]
(;B[me]C[RM: Bad timing? Perhaps black should play more agreesively towards
c8. Black needs to get some more strength here. Later black can
choose to pull out the O15 stone, or use its aji for another
purpose.];W[lf];B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[je];W[mf]
(;B[jg]C[I thought what would the best move to both put pressure on the
white group and save the black cutting stones. In retrospect,
this was not a very good move due to the weaknesses it leaves
behind...

RM: Right. Here you shouldn't worry about the upper and left
side, they are strong enough. The right hand side is weaker.
Q12 will make it stronger, give you some decent terratory and
attack white's center group.]
(;W[ni]C[RM: It seems a waste not to exploit the weakness in blacks shape.
White should be able to reduce black's area whilst strengthening
both sides.];B[ph];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]
(;B[nq]C[RM: No. This is not a joseki position. r9 is important here.
Playing p9 seems natural. It splits white and makes black secure
terratory. White's upper group is in serious trouble, and black
will make some good points whilst threatening it.];W[jq];B[bp]
C[Now I want to make base, since my escape path is possibly cut
off. However, I was also considering E8, but that would've caused
W to play C11.

RM: I prefer d9 here (see previous comments).];W[cq];B[bq];W[el]
;B[gn];W[hp];B[cr];W[dr];B[cp];W[dq];B[br];W[bi]
(;B[dk]C[RM: This area is not urgent. Black has another opportunity to
attack white at p9. Black can then chase white a little whilst
getting stronger and bigger.];W[dl]
(;B[cj]C[RM: This seems a strange move. d11 looks like the right direction.]
;W[bj];B[cg];W[ej];B[bg];W[eb]C[I don't know what W was thinking - probably C11 would've been
best to make eyes.

RM: Yes white can get only one eye on the edge, and the center
is getting crowded. E18 is not urgent. But b12 and c11 may be
mia - see variation two moves ahead.];B[ci]
(;W[ek]C[RM: White b12 makes life.];B[ok]
(;W[pj]C[RM: Not good. This re-inforces the splitting attack.]
;B[pk];W[pi]
(;B[ri]C[RM: I would prefer to split white. Although black three stones
at q9 look weak, the surrounding white groups are not strong
enough to attack.];W[qh];B[qg];W[oh];B[pg];W[rj];B[qj];W[qi]
;B[rh];W[on]
(;B[bh]C[Bad shape, I think. This came to haunt me back later.

RM: It seems unlikely that white can be killed - at least one
eye at the edge with a wall facing the center. It would be better
to make terratory (and stabilise the groups) whilst threatening
white instead.];W[ck];B[dj];W[nj];B[oj];W[oi];B[nk];W[lj];B[kh]
C[RM: Again, attacking like this is not helping black.];W[jj]
;B[ei];W[ge]C[Nice placement from W. My game went totally downhill from here.
Perhaps I should've played F18 earlier?

RM: F18 is not sente, so it would be better to have stabilised
your upper groups by attacking white's weak groups (centre left
and centre right).];B[id];W[ic];B[fb]C[RM: Too small.]
(;W[db]C[RM: White can play a lot of good sente moves before this point.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[gd]C[And this was a total lapse of judgement. Now white has no worries.]

(;W[ie]C[RM: White's move is conservative, black can be killed here...]

if this group escapes.];W[qb];B[rc]
(;W[pa]C[RM: Wrong side.];B[rb];W[oa];B[hb];W[ib];B[gj]C[Too greedy. Got into trouble for this one.

RM: Black is leading, and should not be puching himself into
complications.];W[gl]
(;B[hl]C[Perhaps H9 would've been better?

RM: F11 is a dangerous point. The white group (e8) has one eye
and a strong group nearby for support. Attacking this group appears
to have little purpose at this point in the game.

If black wants to attack white, then black must do so from a
position of strength. F10 would make some sense...];W[hk]C[RM: G9 makes a second eye for white, but I guess white is behind
and wants to complicate the situation.];B[gk];W[gm];B[hm];W[hn]

;B[dh]C[I am not at all sure if either of us could had prevented this
near-seki. Except that two groups outside are not alive...]
;W[dn];B[do];W[em];B[fn]C[The game ended soon with white making a fatal mistake.   However, I think I should've made life at G19, but I thought
I counted I had more liberties than the white group, since W
has to do many approach moves to kill the group. So I fought.
I ran through some variations on how I would've played possible
continuations.

It would be good to hear an experienced players view whether
my solution was correct. I think the game is reasonably close
if the both parties end up with two live groups and a seki.

RM: Yes the final fighting was complicated. I think the main
points to be learned from the game are:-

Attack from strength.
Attack as part of a plan - not to try to kill your opponent.
Attack "all out" to kill only when you can read out the situation
enough to know you will not leave yourself open to be counter-attacked.]
