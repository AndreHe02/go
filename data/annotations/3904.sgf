C[Hello reviewer,
this is a game I played on cyberoro, as a 12k though i am nearer 7k on other servers.

I usually get good fighting games on cyberoro and this one was hard for me

I hope you find it interesting and mybe you could help me fight better go.

Apart from a bad start I thought I didnt do too bad but not too good either.

Thanks for reviewing


Review by John Rae];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pq];B[qo];W[op];B[cn]
C[I thought about a move around r11 to make quick play,
or r8 but that seemd slow.

c6 was also very big so i tenuki, as r5 can be left?

JR: Yes r5 can be left.

I'm not sure I'd rush to approach this stone. I would prefer C15 to make the corner more solid - and strengthen to top generally.]
;W[pm]
(;B[qq]C[JR: not much room in the corner, and living shut in is not a good idea so I'd prefer the alternative.

Since you played tenuki here its only fair to expect white should get something, especially having played 3 stones to your one.

You could also decide to leave the stone - as you did last move.]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[rq];B[qp];W[sr];B[pr]C[s4 then p5 or r7 didnt appeal to me]
;W[rs];B[oq];W[pp];B[pn];W[qm];B[nn]C[not great but i tenuki,
but i thought i could get settled base somehow instead


JR: The trouble is this gives white good potential along the bottom, and can chase you for a fair bit - making gains all the while]
;W[np];B[om];W[pj];B[qh];W[qi];B[ol];W[qk];B[fp]C[I attacked right a bit then get sente for f4,
things dont seem too bad

JR: I think I'd have gone on the third line. The objective is to create a base along the bottom to reduce the potential white has from the right]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[iq];B[er]C[stuck for a move here, so i played e2 to keep white apart, though white could get settled with 

JR: To keep white apart I'd prefer G2];W[dr]C[JR: So E3 looks to make your move at E2 a waste, bit you don't want to take a move to defend - so E2 was probably wrong.]

(;B[io]C[this seemd a good point, but lets white get settled at the bottom, so perhaps e2 was inconsistent

JR Again its worth checking the objective. To stop white doing well along the bottom and also to escape with your group.

Since you're more defensive than attacking in this position I think a contact move is more appropriate. Ideally one that leads to a follow up  that strengthens E2 so keeping that white group separated.]
;W[kp]C[JR: notice how black's moves have "forced" white to expand the solid poition on the bottom - and white can still push out to try to keep the two black groups apart.

The end result has not really reduced white on the bottom at all.]
;B[dl]C[JR: Good, expands the side nicely and threatens to make e" safe and put white on the run]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[fq];B[eq]C[JR: that stone was dead anyway. The job for your  G6 stones is to run away safely before white gets a good attack on them.]
;W[ep]TR[fo][fp]C[JR: The last 2 moves lost you an extra stone AND removed a liberty from your 2 marked stones. That means white has more forcing moves against them.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[hp];W[fr];B[ko];W[lp]C[now e3 and e2 were wasted, this was bad

JR: Not totally wasted. ou must expect to lose stones from time to time - so long as you get compensation. 

Here you're trying to connect your 2 groups and white's not got that big a territory. more than it might have been but not a disaster.]

(;B[hr]C[JR: the temptation to reduce white's territory is big but its not the biggest move. You stop white getting a few points but the alternative is to use your stones on the outisde. this can have more value.]
;W[gm];B[lo];W[jo];B[jp]C[k6 would be the safe move, but white could still cut at l6 so hard to decide]
;W[jn];B[jq];W[mo]
(;B[ln]C[JR: There's no real value in saving those 2 stones. its only 4 points, let them go. The priority is to ensure your groups are safe.]
;W[mn];B[lm];W[mm];B[jm];W[in];B[ml]C[this looks painful though]

;W[mi]C[luckily o10 doesnt work, i didnt read it out before so i was very lucky]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[nj];W[jj];B[mq];W[mp];B[nr];W[ps];B[or]C[now that i see white m2, p2 could be better m3?
as m3 wouldnt be sente though, as black could kill k7 stones in semeai (mybe) , not sure how to fight here

JR: If you're worried about k7 stones then playing down here is not a good idea either way.

Connecting with M3, K2 or similar is really an exchange. White loses all the territroy aon the bottom but captures 6 stones to compensate.

Anyway white might capture Q2 first - which gives black time to start to make the O11 group safe!]

;W[gp];B[fm];W[gl];B[gk]C[i realised that e8 would be safe for white, but black gets out nicely,

i wonder if chasing white out would be of benefit to black]
;W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[dm];W[em]C[i get these nice forcing moves this way though]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[ir];W[ek]C[e9 is very honte i wonder if there was a way to get e9 first

JR: you've got groups running for their live all over the place. Getting sente to take e9 as well is asking too much :)]

(;B[pb]C[JR: Is this needed to keep the group alive? I think not so is it the biggest attacking move?

I feel I'd have played elsewhere but I'm not sure which option would be best.]
;W[ce]C[i have doubt about this white move, i fear trouble for black in upper right first

JR: And white fears the potenbtial  black has on the left more. This move also helpsbuild a position to attack the G9 group again.]
;B[cj]C[this or c11 pincer better?
at least white cant interfere with c10

JR: this keeps the side stones safe so its not bad];W[ch];B[gc]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[ob]
(;B[cd]C[these last few moves i think black got let of the hook

JR: i think the opposite. White hasa weak group top left and top right. Good chance one or the other can be killed]
;W[de];B[ej]C[JR: good];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[ei]C[i wish i didnt play this but g15 straightaway - faster]
;W[di]
(;B[ge]C[JR White's connected to the group on the side is alive. The wall is facing a strong white position so achieves little.

So this is purely defensive (as you said.)];W[kc];B[rn];W[qn]
;B[po]C[s6 is bad habit - but is it really bad?

JR: S6 was OK , perhaps not the biggest at the time];W[rm];B[qb]
