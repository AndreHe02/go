C[Actorios [4k\]: Thank you very much for accepting to review this game. We would be interested to have comments for both sides. Aside from the questions, any highlight on errors (and good moves, if any ;^) would be most welcome.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]LB[jp:C][jq:B][kq:A]C[H: I have 662 games in my database with this opening.  ABC are the most common moves by far.  This area is the biggest area for both, which makes it an urgent area.]
(;W[dj]C[H: This is not a BAD move, but it seems to be a bit slack.  This allows black to get a nice move in the most urgent area.]
;B[fq]LB[jp:A]C[H: This and A are the two moves I'd consider.]
;W[hq]
(;B[dn]C[H: This feels like a slight overplay to me.  If W responds calmly, I expect a favorable result.]
;W[fp]C[Actorios [4k\]: Was this an appropriate response from white?]
(;B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[cp];B[cq];W[fn];B[bq];W[bp]C[Actorios [4k\]: Is this mandatory for white to play this move? isn't there something more important / urgent to play?]
;B[ek]LB[fc:A][nd:C][pj:B]C[Actorios [4k\]: Is this shoulder move correct?

H: I think, this is not the biggest area.  Moves around A, B and C should have been considered, at least.]
;W[ej];B[fk];W[fj];B[gk];W[cl]C[Actorios [4k\]: Is this response appropriate to the shoulder move?]
;B[gj]C[Actorios [4k\]: the review will be interesting];W[gi]
;B[cc]LB[dc:B][dl:A]C[Actorios [4k\]: Is the timing correct for this move?

H: Hard to say.  I think, now isn't quite right, black should at least threaten to cut the groups with A first and possibly connect in sente.  A white move at B to solidify the corner is a bit too slow, this early.]

(;W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf]C[H: This way, W has less territory and gote.]

[fr][kr][fs][ks]C[H: Now we need to take stock of the situation.  There is some solid territory we can count:
White has about 52 points in this single chunk of territory.
Black has 39 points, with how things stand so far.  Black also has the benefit of being the clear leader in influence.

It seems that white should find some way to erase black's influence.  I would begin considering A, B, C and D.]
(;W[ik]C[Actorios [4k\]: Is this an abusive move? I played it by shape but it lacks a back up... Stepping back from the game, I feel I should have played something around M4 to prepare it.

H: This seems like white will become heavy quickly.]
(;B[jl]C[H: This method of attacking by running head on is usually bad.]

;B[kj];W[kk];B[jg];W[jf];B[kg];W[nc]LB[qg:A]C[H: There is not much potential on this side.  A would have been better.]
;B[le];W[kc]C[H: It's difficult to understand the thought here.  White can not make much here.]
;B[je]LB[qj:A]C[H: This is a nice chance for White.  White needs to do something about the right hand side urgently.  I would consider A strongly.]

;W[ia];B[jj];W[oh];B[oi]C[H: If we count score, we'll see that white is ahead by a margin which can't be made up at this point in the game.  Most of the problems in this game came from the fuseki, both players making some mistakes which led to the game we see here.  In the end, black failed to capitalize on W's weak shape in the top and center, which led to a collapse of his territory and the final result which is white being undeniably ahead.  It's a pity that black won by time in this game, because the game was set to be a certain white win.]
