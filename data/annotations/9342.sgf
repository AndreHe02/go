C[Hi,



please review for the black side.



thanks];B[qd]C[aina [2k\]: hi

LB[gr:A][co:B][fo:C][gp:D]C[can black turn at g2?

Janr: the two joseki options are A (G2) and B (c5).
The game move, the atari at C, is considered wrong because then white doesn't need to defend anymore at A, and black will end in got playing B.
If Black plays B, then White A, Black C and White D, after which black has sente.
This development is normal, the variant starting at black B is possible if black wants to fight.]

Janr: white can also attach first at the 3-3 point (see variation.
In the game, black gets quite big corner territory.];B[qp];W[ro]
LB[po:A]C[
Janr: the second line is rather unusual.  Normally white plays A]
;B[po];W[pn];B[cf]LB[on:A][pm:B]C[i like black so far

Janr: in fact, black played an endgame move at B2 which was not necessary.
Had black followed the joseki, he would have taken sente without playing b2
Replacing b2 with a big move elsewhere would have been a gain.

On the other hand, white played suboptimally in the lower right (but didn't waste a move)

For this move, I think exchanging first A for B is still useful in the lower right.]
;W[fc];B[dj];W[oc];B[qg];W[qb];B[od]C[not sure why i played p16, i wanted to keep white low at the top


janr: there is no need to strengthen white.
The next black move (attacking white on the right) is much more useful.]

(;B[rf]LB[ph:A]C[janr:
I would prefer black A.
First, it keeps the white group below under attack.
Second, the other white stone is weaker (see variation)];W[ri]

janr: Black just lost two stones, and white's group is now strong and alive.]

janr: it is possible to improve the endgame, but the most serious mistakes happened in the opening/ middle game.
In particular, the cut at A was painful, the loss of two stones at B would have made a big difference, Black never came to cut at C or D (an endgame difference of more than 12 points), and even though black could capture 4 stones (8 points) at E starting the cut at G didn't pay off as white made 16 points at F by attacking this black group.]

There is still the option of attacking the other white stone.]
