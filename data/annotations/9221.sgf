C[I played white this game.

[kb\]: I will make my comments with the [kb\] prefix on the main branch.  See below for general comments.

Summary:
The game is split into two parts.  At the beginning, you played many overconcentrated and slow moves, and fell behind quite a bit because of it.  Do not be goaded into playing moves on the second line in the opening; you played two of them.  Black was winning solidly on territory when the last major opening move on the right side was played (by Black).

In the second part of the game, two things happened.  You had a minor problem attempting a fancy shape on the lower left side; this is not too bad, as you were trying to apply something you learned from a class.  However, you had a couple of fundamental shape problems in the lower right, and played several slow moves in the fight at the top.

In my point of view, Black was up by at least 20 to 30 points after these errors.

Afterwards, though, your opponent stopped playing at the 3 dan level and inexplicably dropped to 5 kyu level, playing 3 to 4 passes and gave away their humongous lead.  You played normally while they played badly and ended up gaining 30 to 40 points as a result.

*I would say that you managed to not lose the game.*  I think the biggest takeaway from this game is to make sure you focus on the important areas of the board, tenuki more often to play them when it is clearly no longer urgent for you to play in an area (second line moves, single-purpose plays) and keep an eye on the whole board position as you play them.  Black should have won this game due to your inattentiveness, but somehow managed to play very poorly in the second half of the game.  Perhaps they became tired?

Thanks for the game.  Although my tone may be construed as negative above, my hope is to the contrary:  I encourage you to keep studying and learning to improve.  This game is an amazing one!]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[oc]C[Here, it is tempting to play on the right, as it is a nice area for both the Q4 stone and the P17 enclosure.

However, I feel that the corner approach is bigger, so I played E4.

[kb\]: Approaching the corner is classically bigger than extending down the right, but modern play is a little bit different.]
;W[ep];B[gq]C[Typically I play C3 here.  But I don't especially care for the shown variation.

[kb\]: There are other variations on the joseki you indicated - see if you like the one I gave.]

(;W[fo]C[Because of the items mentioned in the variation, I played F5, planning to treat the stones lightly so that I could get initiative on the right.

For example (see variation)...

[kb\]: I've never heard the term "light" associated with this move - usually a diagonal play like this is preparing to press in one direction or another, or to prevent an easy connection.]

(;B[go]C[He played the contact move here.

I was almost tempted to play R10 anyway, but this touching move was too difficult to resist.

So I contemplated the following variation starting at C3.

[kb\]: Black G5 is a moyo-building move, but there's no moyo to build, so it looks bad.  Just let Black give you strength against the corner.]

(;W[gn]C[[kb\]: Without additional local context, this move should be automatic for you.  Any other move is bad form.]

(;B[gp]C[He played here, though.

What struck me immediately was that the previous effectiveness of F5 to prevent the cut was now void (see variation with pass).

To deal with this weakness, I decided to *now* play at C3 in an effort to prevent the connection underneath at E3.

[kb\]: Black's move is an old joseki.  See comments two moves later for the branch I added here.]

(;W[cq];B[eq]C[But he played E3 anyway.

However, I felt this was not all bad, because I could play C5, and maybe make a position on the left.

[kb\]: As you found out, C3 does not prevent a cut.  If you want to do that, D3 is the move.  Otherwise you should play H6 to make excellent shape in the center (and in the joseki, prevent a large Black moyo).
However, since you already have the Q4 stone, I think it is more valuable to play D3.]
;W[co];B[dq];W[dp];B[bp]
(;W[cm]C[Here, I tried to be fancy based on something I heard at a lecture at go congress.

But since he can just play B5 as in the game, maybe it's not that great.  Probably I should do B5 in sente, then extend to D10 or so (see variation).

[kb\]: Playing C7 anticipates a tenuki after Black's play at B5 and treats C5 lightly.  However, you respond to B5, so you are not treating C5 lightly, which makes C7 bad.

In addition, there is a useful stone at C3, so it makes the move at C7 all the worse.  Instead, you can try the following variation:]
;B[bo];W[cn]C[I feel black is slightly ahead now.

White is cramped and overconcentrated.

C7 was a bad move.];B[cr];W[hn];B[cg]C[Here I was at a loss.  C11 or so seems too close to white's thickness.

So I decided I'd let him worry about the thickness, whiIe I made profit in the corner.]
;W[ce]C[[kb\]: This is the correct move.];B[cj]C[Now, to add to the influence...]

(;W[dh]C[[kb\]: The resulting board position looks cramped for White after this.  There is not an opportunity to expand your moyo.  I cannot recommend this move.

If you want to experiment, you could try attacking directly:]
;B[ch];W[dj];B[di];W[ei];B[ci];W[dk]TR[ei][dj][gn][hn]C[[kb\]: White's position is heavily overconcentrated and not expandable.]
;B[bf]C[I expected E12 instead of this.  I don't mind this exchange as white.

[kb\]: You may also consider E14.]
(;W[be];B[bl]C[I can almost ignore this move.  I could play E12.  Or maybe Q10 to complement the H6 area.

To be honest, I feel that's a little bit better now that I look at it.

See variation.

[kb\]: Yes, you SHOULD ignore this move...]
(;W[bm]C[[kb\]: What are you doing playing B7?  Play E14 as indicated before or Q10/R10.]
;B[eh];W[fi];B[eg]C[Here, Q10 may be better.  I wanted to expand my influen with G13.

I'm not sure about this, though, so I'll ask this in a diagram.]
;W[gg];B[qj]C[Big point for black!

[kb\]: Black's fuseki is successful.  B7 is the biggest culprit.]
;W[kc]C[To prevent black playing here, I thought this was somewhat urgent.

[kb\]:  Because of the presence of the two marked Black stones, this White move is not as big as it seems.  Better is to play R8, even though Black played there first.  It threatens an invasion within Black's right side framework.  No matter what you play at the top, Black will approach at R6.

Locally, a move to protect the left corner is bigger.];B[qn]
C[Defending passively lets black have his way.  So a play at R8 seemed appropriate.]
;W[ql]C[[kb\]: An overplay.  See variation for punishment.]

(;B[qq]C[[kb\]: This is the wrong direction.  White can make thickness to invade Black's framework on the right side.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]
(;W[rn]C[I think R5 is better.  S6 just leaves aji.

[kb\]: This move is for endgame only and bad shape.  Don't leave cutting points where you need to be thick!]
;B[nq]C[[kb\]: (Ignoring S6) White's thickness can be put to use here to invade and separate the R10 stone from Black's top right corner enclosure.  However, because of the shape weakness, White should push once at O4.  See variation.]

(;W[qh];B[np];W[no];B[mo];W[mn]C[He punished me well.  I was too aggressive.

[kb\]: Oh no, your shape is going to collapse!];B[qo];W[on]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[mp];B[mq];W[lo]C[I received some compensation, which worked alright with H6, but locally, I lost out.

I think the big mistake was to let him get O4.  It was a great move.

[kb\]: The mistake was S6 instead of R5.];B[ic]C[[kb\]: Too early.  Black should escape or sacrifice R10 first.  Now, White gets to control the direction of the attack and influence the upcoming fight between R10/R12.]
;W[fc];B[ie];W[ke];B[ig];W[ii]C[[kb\]: Too aggressive and attempting to make points with your wall.  Black should play L13, an obvious move.]
;B[gf]C[[kb\]: And yet, Black gives you a chance...];W[ff];B[ge]
;W[kg];B[hg]TR[gf][kg][ii]C[[kb\]: ...and another... White plays two moves, while Black effectively passes and plays half a move.]
;W[jh];B[fg]C[[kb\]: Another pass...];W[gh]C[[kb\]: Not sente.  Play P12 and the game is over.]
;B[fe];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[gc];W[fd];B[gd];W[fb]C[Here I just wanted to keep sente.  I wasn't sure if F18 was sente.

[kb\]: Your last three moves damaged your own shape.  Leave it until the outcome is more certain.]
;B[jb]
(;W[qf]C[[kb\]: A bit greedy and gives Black a chance to play sabaki in the center.  Just capture the stone straightforwardly.  See variation.]
;B[jo];W[jn];B[ko];W[kn];B[kq]C[[kb\]: Black keeps passing and allowing you to gain sente over and over.]
;W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[mc]
(;W[lb]C[This is probably small.  I think it's bigger to play O14 or so (variation)

[kb\]: Very small!  When you're leading, don't play risky!]
