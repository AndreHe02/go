black : 13k
white : 12k];B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[op];W[qi];B[qk]C[black : should i play here?

NM: looks good to me. The approach
from the other side (R13) has the
advantage of approaching from the
weaker side, but because it's a three-
space extension is so weak that it
needs reinforcement, thereby losing
sente.];W[pe];B[od]C[NM: I don't like this move. I would
suggest R15, R13, or Q16 instead.];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb]C[black : should i play here?or where?

NM: It's certainly playable, and  represents a useful attack on W's
eye space. But I'm not sure
it's the biggest point on the
board. I would play somewhere
round K17 instead.];W[oj];B[ol]C[black : right?

NM: again, playable, and makes nice
territory; but gote - W's shape is
pretty solid. Again I would play
on the top side first.];W[iq];B[gc]C[NM: Area is certainly right - I would
go to F17 myself.];W[dj];B[oe]C[NM: Good!];W[of];B[jd]C[black : should i play at O14 instead?

NM: No, I prefer this. If you play
O14, W could even ignore it and
invade.];W[nf];B[md]C[NM: Too defensive for my taste - there
is a lot of the board open, and W has
played on a larger scale than B. I
would play something like L3 or C14.];W[jj];B[df];W[fe]C[NM: W's keima here is too thin.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[fj]C[NM: A bit too hopeful ... I think B
whouls jump out, say to G6, before
capping at F10.];W[el];B[fg];W[fn];B[ci];W[cj];B[di];W[ej];B[ei]
;W[fk];B[cc]C[NM: Excellent!];W[ed];B[cd];W[fc];B[gd];W[fd]
;B[hf];W[cb];B[bb];W[db];B[gb];W[ce];B[de];W[bd];B[bc];W[be]
;B[cf];W[ba];B[bf];W[ac];B[gj]C[NM: I'm mystified why B doesn't play
A15 now to kill the W corner.];W[lq];B[cq];W[dq]C[NM: B was lucky. W could have replied
C4, requiring B to live very small -
and a play at B5 might even have been  able to kill both sides. Instead W  allowed B to link up ...]
;B[cp];W[bn];B[bo];W[cr];B[br];W[ao];B[bp];W[do];B[dr]C[NM: should have been B7.]
;W[er];B[cs];W[es];B[ds];W[nr];B[pr]C[black : where should i defend?

NM: That looks very good to me.];W[ln];B[hk];W[im];B[hm];W[hn]
;B[gm]C[NM: B7 is surely bigger (not to  mention A15); or S10, T15, M8 ...!]

;W[lj];B[ki];W[ll];B[lf]C[NM: Nice result for B, with him
making territory in the centre.];W[mi];B[nn])
