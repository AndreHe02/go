Hi Jeremy.  

Here's my game summary:

White was able to erase an early advantage by invading both corner on the right side.  A white attachment on the right side was not attacked profitably, and finally a center invasion erased most of black's remaining advantage.

Black did end up winning because of minor tactical skirmishes in the late game, and poor endgame play by white.  However, black lost the strategic game.

There are various comments thoughout the game.

I hope you find my review helpful.. Thanks,

C. Thomas

Hello!
I played black in this game. Please let me know how to utilize my thickness to benefit from white's invasions, and about any incorrect intuitive shape moves I make. I'd also like to know specific areas that I need the most improvement on.

Thanks for reviewing my game,

;W[dj];B[pj]C[Is this around the best move at the moment?

No complaints from me.  White is looking somewhat overconcentrated on the left.  Your stones seem more efficient.]
;W[qc]C[I would rejoice at this invasion.  your resulting thickness could really help you dominate the middle game.]

To really develop Q10 and Q4, try the variation at P16...];W[ob]

(;B[lc]C[Better to extend as I did, or to go down?

Well, the cut at P16 is possible since the ladder is against you and M17 also, but I don't see it as a huge problem.

I might play O10 here instead...];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or]
;B[nq];W[nr];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[lq]C[Another extension too far I think.  O10 needs to be taken advantage of.  Even huger than before.]
;W[qj]C[What is the best way to handle this invasion?

--


It looks like white will certainly find a way to live here.  Some bolstering at O10 would have come in handy here.  Difficult to attack this strongly.

The best way to handle this invasion was to play O10 before I think.  An gram of prevention is worth a kilogram of cure.  

We can certainly talk about the relative benefits of ways to deal with this, but I think the real mistakes occurred earlier.  

Because of the white encroachments at F5, I would probably start at R11, and seek to jump out to F15 after building a bit of thickness.]

(;B[qk]C[I dislike this direction because of white F5 group.  F15  is more promising.]

Leaves the cut at Q9.  R13 tries too hard to kill.]
(;W[pi]LB[pk:A]C[white is missing out on a great opportunity: Q9.]

The humiliating R8 is a direct result of leaving that cut at Q9 in favor of R13.]

;W[ri];B[gm]C[
This is what I meant about choosing the other direction to attack the R10 attachment: 

Imagine this position transposed to the top, using this move to play F15 instead.]
;W[jj]C[I wasn't sure how to react to this move.

--

Your options are limited.  Your opponent has more side and corner territory, and you need the center to win.

Your only winning strategy is to kill that stone, but it may not be possible, considering K10's path to connection at the left, the large open territory to make eyes in, and the cutting point at O10.]
;B[gj]C[I would try something similar.];W[mj]LB[ki:A]C[
There's a strong compulsion to protect this cut, but you might have to allow the cut, instead ruining his eye shape caused by the 2 space extension.  I would try A:

--

White maybe should have started with H11, G12, something like that.]

(;B[nj];W[hi];B[gi];W[mk]
(;B[kh]LB[ki:A][kk:B]C[I feel my moves are a bit vague but and I'm not sure how to control white.

--

He gained a head start when you protected at O10.

But then, N9 was a slow and heavy move by white.  You still have a chance.

I think L12 is too far away.  a or b would be better to ruin eye shape.]

(;B[om]LB[nl:A]C[A is better to remove eye shape.];W[mi]
(;B[mh]LB[ki:A][km:B]C[No.  white is surrounded on a larger scale - you need to prevent eye shape.  Surrounding closely can actually help your opponent make sabaki.  A good stab at b would have been more effective here, at removing eye shape.

What do you care if white pushes out at N12?  There's nowhere to run to, and he won't connect to his group on the right.]
;W[km]C[
By now you probably wish you had stabbed the eye shape at L9.

His sabaki is coming along beautifully.];B[jn];W[ki]C[He's alive.  Black can resign here.
