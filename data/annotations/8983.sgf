AB[pd][dp]C[Jon: Hello
Thank you for the review.
In this game I am playing as Black. The result is W+21,5.
I mostly wonder how I should have handled the invasion at C7 (move 77) better.
But please tell me what you think about everything.
//Jon


JJ: Hi Jon, I'm Juan Jesus (JJHaggar on KGS), I'l try doing my best by reviewing this game. Hope you like the review :)]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[op];B[pn];W[lp]C[JJ: This is a mistake from white, he should have chosen any joseki move (this one isn't from any joseki I know)]
;B[pq]C[JJ: Good response, this way black force white into a heavy position.]
;W[oq]
(;B[dj]TR[jp][jq]C[JJ: This move may be a bit too mild. I'd prefer a move around K4 / K3, thus putting his group under pressure and maintaining sente.]
;W[fq]C[JJ: White can attack here, making a good extenxion from his M4 group.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[eq];W[gq]C[JJ: Bad move from white, he should have played F5 first (Joseki)]
;B[fo]C[JJ: Great shape for you];W[ch]C[JJ: As you can see, white made his attacks jumping from his own groups, and trying not to be splitted.]
;B[ci]C[JJ: You actualy helped him by doing this];W[dh]TR[ej]
[ck]SQ[dl][el]C[JJ: He's got good shape and a good extension, while you got bad shape and need to fix it soon. C9 and E10 are typical weak points of that shape. D8 and E8 are also good points to attack, but they would be played later, when white had his groups a bit more settled.]
;B[er]TR[hn]C[Jon: I believe this movie is pointless.

JJ: I do agree, it's a small move, white can ignore it or maybe jump at H6 to fix his weakness around there.]
(;W[nc]
(;B[ic]TR[lc][pf][qf]C[JJ: Again too mild, it doesn't put pressure in any of his groups. And sure, you can make a perfect extension no matter where he play next, but the problem is he also can do it, and now it's his turn. 
If you want to pincer you should play about M17 which puts more pressure on O17. You could also answer on Q14 or R14 if you feel peaceful. Remember, if you want the right side you should play Q14 or R14, and if you want the north side you should pincer.]
(;W[kc]C[JJ: The problem here is that this is white's ideal extension]
;B[fc];W[dc]
(;B[ne]C[JJ: I don't like this move, it's cuttable (you'll ned to fix the shape later) and doesn't put enough pressure on white]
;W[ke]C[JJ: Be careful now, your J17 group is all alone, and on top of that your top-left group is weak. The cause is O15.]
;B[qf]TR[pf]C[Jon: This one seems out of place, but not sure where to play locally.

JJ: The problem here was the previous move, now is hard to fix all the problems. If you want to play locally, you maybe could play Q14, you'd make a "dog's head" shape, which is a pretty good shape.]

;W[cm]C[JJ: The problem isn't how to handle this invasion, but how to avoid not being prepared to face ANY invasion. You always need to have a plan to handle problems like this. This time, your C11 and D10 stones were too weak to handle the invasion.]

;W[cn];B[tt];W[km];B[tt];W[gr]C[JJ: I think the main problem is that you leave him take the lead several times (with some mild moves), thus letting him decide where the game should go. You should remember from now that, in this game, who keeps sente (initiative) usually wins the game. Another problem was that you leave some groups with shape problems, like the one that cause the deadly invasion at C7. Yose wasn't perfect but not bad at all, so I thought it didn't need to be commented.

Hope you enjoyed the review, and I also wish you a happy 2013! :D
