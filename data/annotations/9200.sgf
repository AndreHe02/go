AB[pd][dp]C[Otto: I'm white and around 9k. I struggled a lot with this game. Made some wrong decisions. I lost with 19,5 point. I have played 2 games against the same opponent a few days before. It was without a handicap and won them both with about 30 point. My thoughts and questions are in the comment.
Thank's for your time and comment!

Hi, my name is Kheng Hun, I will denote my comments with kh: 
I would advice you submit non-handicap games and play more normals too, they help improve more, especially since the opening moves will be more usual.]
PL[W];W[dd];B[pp];W[qf];B[nc];W[qj]C[kh: not that common in this position, leaves a weakness at R12]
;B[fc];W[ec]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[Otto: Made this move, so I can play a or b next.

kh: this is not so common in modern play];B[fd];W[cf];B[nq]
;W[fq]LB[dj:B][cn:A]C[Otto: Thought white at A, black 11, white B or d8 makes black bottom to big. So chose white 11]
;B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[qn]LB[cj:B][qq:A][lr:C]C[Otto: What is a good next move? My thoughts are A,B or C.

kh: here the weakness at right side is a problem, caused by your earlier move. Otherwise left side looks big. top may develop well too. A would be quite small, not easy to get a ko too.]
;W[qq]C[Otto: I reacted spontaneous on 17 with this move. How to make a good shape in the corner?]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qr];W[rr];B[pr];W[qo];B[po]LB[pn:B][rn:A]TR[qo]
[qp][qq]C[Otto: Next move A, B or another move to make the white group live?]

(;W[pn];B[qm];W[pm]TR[qm][qn]C[Otto: I hope to get the Blake group.]
;B[ql];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol]
(;B[om];W[on];B[nm];W[nn];B[mm];W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[ll];W[km]
;B[kl]C[kh: here it is important to connect your stones first, you cannot capture the m6 stone easily.]

(;W[lo]C[Otto: I hesitated on capturing m6 or o7]
(;B[jl]C[kh: bad move for black as it does not actually help him in any way.]
;W[kn];B[ml]C[kh: now black has gote and white has chance to fight in the corner.]
;W[rn];B[kr];W[lq]
(;B[mo]C[kh: poor play by black again, I will show alternative whenever i can find better play.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[lr]C[kh: this is much larger and threaten survival of whole black group. so black should get m2 earlier.]
;B[mr];W[mq];B[nr]
(;W[ls];B[oo];W[ln];B[np]
(;W[rp]TR[qo][qp][qq]C[Otto: I secured my group so I don't get troubles with group r7. But p9 isn't strong as well. So I have safe B, or capture A before B is captured,]
;B[ph]C[kh: great move here, aiming for two weaknesses at once, unfortunately the cut does not work. it is not easy to find a black move which works well here though.]
;W[rh]
(;B[pk];W[pj];B[oj];W[nj];B[oi];W[nk];B[ni]LB[ok:B][ql:A]C[Otto: Just capture B now, or first run with B? Didn't know what was better. Run for a while an then captured A.]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[lj];B[li];W[rl];B[kj];W[qk]C[Was not needed.

kh: yup it is important to be accurate and not waste moves on a dead group.]
;B[ci];W[ck]C[Otto: Is this  good choice? What is better if it's not a good move? What

this looks agressive, black has got some influnce here. 
I would try to break the top territory first, with moves like e 14 and p14]
;B[di];W[ek];B[fi];W[gk];B[fn];W[hm]TR[ck][ek][gk]C[Otto: I was afraid that the white group couldn't live. Started search for a way to escape, connect or live. Didn't really know what to do

kh: over here I would feel that black top is way too large, the fight at btm right did not go too well, plenty of chances were missed. The game should be quite over now.]
;B[hl];W[hj];B[hh]C[Otto: Black I getting a lot at the to now.]

(;W[kg]LB[ij:A]TR[jl][kl][ll][ml][mm][nm][om]C[Otto: Better was on A and catch the black group.]
;B[ij]TR[ji][ki]C[Otto: Save these white stones or not? If black gets all the top area, he wins for sure.]
;W[of];B[mg];W[lf];B[mf];W[me];B[ne];W[nf];B[jg]LB[gh:B][ki:A]
TR[ci][di][fi]C[Otto: Stopped notating here. A was captured. The other white groups lived. I made a cut at B and could pressure the black left group.  I lost with 19,5 point.

kh: i would advice you to fight less in positions that you are not confident in, i have played more passively recently too. It is important to try to read out sequences and look for chances to kill and to live. Reading skills are essential in this game. Good luck and have fun! I will be free to take another review of a non-handicap game if you think you played well and did not blunder too much. Games with blunders happen often to me too, just try to play well and I will be free to review a careful game that is played out with more time spent into thinking of each move. Remember that in non blitz games, you have time to think so use it wisely, plan before you attack. Good luck and have fun!]
