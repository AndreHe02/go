C[Submitted by B (David), reviewed by
Niall. Reviewer's comments are preceded
by "NM".];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do];W[cm];B[cq];W[cp];B[dp]
;W[co];B[eq]C[NM: Not joseki. The joseki calls for C6; while there are various possible developments, B comes out better for having pushed in there. You could say that C6 is the way B takes profit from having played C3.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[bq]C[I'm not sure it was the correct time to play it, my aim is to play C6 next

NM: Well, you could just leave it till later, but W might play D5. I think it's
a good forcing move to play now, and you will end in sente. But the overall position is going to be noticeably less good than if you had played the joseki.]
;W[br];B[cn];W[bn];B[dn];W[bo]C[NM: The difference is that with the joseki W has to guard at B4, which means D7 is sente (or else W cuts above C6, in which case B has lots more possibilities at the bottom).]
;B[fp]C[it worked as I planned, but I feel uneasy about this f4, the ladder is in my favor, but I mind white to peep at F4, what is the alternative?

I also feel uneasy about white D7 next

NM: Yes, I don't think you can really leave it and play tenuki. But other possibilities include D7 or somewhere round H4.]
;W[dm];B[jq]C[I feel a bit shameful about this move... I shouldn't try to make territory from my wall, should I play o3 or R6 instead? I also considered F6, but I think it was too slow and don't bring me anything much.

NM: Yes, either O3 or R6 would have been better. Or indeed C13.]
;W[cf];B[fc];W[bd];B[di]C[I prefer to play here then just defend at C17

NM: Yes, but better still - nearly sente - would have been C12.]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[df]C[NM: No! You've made him remove a weakness and lost yourself the chance to play, e.g., C15 then D14. The timing of forcing moves is always difficult, but here I'm sure it's better to hold off. Simply somewhere round G11.]
;B[gh];W[bi]C[NM: Terrible! Pure territory, and can even help B to get established. If W is worried about his stones (which he shouldn't be), he can play C17. But better yet would be something like H14.]
;B[bh]C[I offered this stone as sacrifice to get the result I get few moves later, was it a good idea?

NM: Looks OK to me. His stones are nearly alive already, so the extra strength you give them counts for little; and given that W has made such a cowardly move already he's not likely to spurn the sacrifice and play C11 followed by D10.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[bg];B[bj];W[ah];B[ck]C[I get what I wanted, if white push at D12, I'll play E11 sacrificing the D13 stone.

NM: Good];W[gf];B[fg]C[NM: less dramatically bad than before, but still not worth playing.]
;W[ff];B[cc]C[should I play H16/J17 instead?

NM: Difficult question; they seem to me to have similar values.]
;W[bc]C[NM: Too early. This is an early endgame move.];B[hd]
C[NM: Good!];W[hc]
(;B[gc]C[NM: If you're going to respond on this side, I prefer G16, because G17 leaves W the threat of cutting off the H16 stone.
But what about the other side? See variant.];W[ic];B[id];W[jc]
;B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le]C[NM: I think that having got here I would play either G15 or K13.]
;W[md];B[nc]C[NM: Looks elegant, but leaves a gaping hole at L15. First reinforce.]
;W[me];B[mc];W[lc];B[pf];W[ed]C[I thought white wanted to menace the cut at G16 with this move, hoewer I felt I could live even I be cut, it's why I defended (cannot afford white E17 next)

NM: Yes, but the weakness at L15 is serious.];B[ec];W[fd]C[white mistake?

NM: I would say so.];B[gd];W[lf];B[jf]C[NM: Good.];W[hh];B[hi]
C[NM: I would have haned at H13.];W[ih];B[hg];W[gg];B[fh];W[ig]
;B[if];W[hf];B[kg]C[I feel this move is not so good... I was not 100% confident I could live only with top left, so I tried to escape
NM: The trouble is you're still not definitely alive, so you're a target for further attacks. Even so, it might have been OK if you had been breaking into a W moyo; but that's not the case here. I would play L15 to be sure of life and threaten the cut at N14.]
;W[ke];B[ii];W[gj];B[gi];W[mh];B[jh]C[this move make me uneasy too... I know white can cut at K11, I can escape, but I'll jurt my left group in the operation, should I just leave it like it was and play a move like R11 or R6?

NM: I like this move, because it remopves any doubt about the life of the C9 group.]
;W[ph]C[this move seemed exagerated to me, so I played to make a double menace...]
;B[ng]C[cut at O12 or cut at N13];W[li]C[NM: The classic defence ... but I would still cut at O12 and damn the torpedoes.]
;B[ki]C[I didn't expect white last move, in one way he helped me to connect, but now the cut  at N13 is not really working anymore (I can get a ko)]
;W[lj];B[lh]C[I didn't feel comfortable to play the ko... however I guess this is an horrible move,

NM: Indeed. Resolves the ko all by itself.

 was N13 white M13 black M12 (start a ko) playable?

NM: Tricky. I would have left it till later.];W[mg];B[oh];W[oi]
;B[pi];W[ni];B[qh];W[pj];B[qi]C[I felt white didn't do his best in last sequence, I am quite happy of the result

NM: Well, he could have played Q11 first. But still you've given him quite a nice wall, which works well with his Q4 stone.]
;W[qc]C[exagerated invasion? (anyway, white don't lose anything to try...)

NM: I think it's difficult for you to avoid letting him have a ko here. Still as W I would first have played something like M3, and only come back here later.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[pb];B[ob];W[rb];B[pa];W[qa];B[qb];W[je]
C[I spent a bit time reading, what can happen if I be cut... I concluded I can live.]
;B[ra];W[ie];B[bb];W[db];B[cb];W[ab];B[hb];W[ib];B[ga];W[cd]
;B[dc];W[qj];B[pn]C[NM: I would have played the more standard R6.]
;W[mq];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[op];W[nq];B[rp]
;W[oo];B[qo];W[po];B[on];W[no];B[rn]C[I am very happy here, I should have counted and see how much ahead I am now. I still had an uneasy feeling about my top left group... white considered me alive, so I didn't bother too much... is there any way for white to kill me?

NM: I don't see any.];W[qm];B[qn];W[hq]C[I felt it's another white desesperate move... where to play.... J4 or J5?

NM: I would play J4. I don't see how you can stop him from escaping if you play J5. See the variants.]

(;B[ip]C[I have the feeling I should have played at J5, it happened in another of my game in a similar situation where white lived after such move when the knight move would have killed him... Tell me what is the best here?]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[jr];B[kr];W[jp];B[iq]C[NM: Not good. Better K5.]
;W[ir];B[kp]C[NM: You must play L3!];W[go];B[hn];W[gp];B[gn]

;W[gr];B[fr];W[fs];B[gs];W[hs];B[es];W[gs];B[gq]C[I think white could kill me without even give me a ko]

;W[lm];B[ll]C[I felt I could kill white, and that would make me even for the loss of the E3 group

NM: Looks difficult to me.];W[kl];B[ml];W[jm]C[now killing seems much less likely... I start to want to resign]
;B[kk];W[jk];B[kn];W[km];B[kj];W[ko];B[jo]C[no choice here...]
;W[jn];B[qs]C[bad move I think];W[in];B[io];W[gl]C[I'm getting more and more unhappy]
;B[fl];W[gm];B[fm];W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[hk];W[gk];B[dk];W[ps]
;B[il]C[normally I expected to get only the L9 stone...];W[hm]
C[I felt white is winning big time since I lost a group and failed to kill O2 group... however now I realize the game was just even, maybe slightly at black's advantage.

NM: about even];B[im]C[when playing this I was fully aware of the sequence I put in variations... but I thought if I don't try something, I'll lose the game...]

(;W[ik]C[I'm very happy here, I think that maybe I still have a chance

;B[gb];W[dh];B[eg]C[I don't mind to play E12... I was considering an eventual atari at C13 and maybe even getting a chance to kill white if I can cut him at H15

NM: Looks impossible to me ...];W[eh];B[ei];W[jj];B[ji];W[nk]

I win by 19.5 points. but I don't feel very happy about this game, I feel I did many mistakes, failed to punish white properly and used some moves I knew were not working (but I got lucky). I hope this is the sign I'm about to improve :-)

Thanks for reviewing this game.

David.
