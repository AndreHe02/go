C[rev: Hi Ted, I앐 Jorge, jorgeant in igs, a poor 13k* so i앐 not the best boy, but on the other hand i앐 closer to you so i understand better your playing (well, i hope), mmm, and sorry but this is my first review ;-)]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[cj];W[jp];B[jd]C[These first seven moves all look like reasonable opening moves, but after White's next move I didn't know how to respond.]
;W[dq]LB[cq:A][dp:B][fq:C][qf:D]TR[pd][cp]C[Here I had no idea whether I should be playing D4 or C3.  I figured C3 would lose more territory on the right-hand side, but as it is I ended up losing territory in the corner and the entire right side anyhow.

rev: it압 VERY important in go not just follow your oponent, if all you do is defending is difficult to win a game, so having to choose between A or B, i would play B, it invite white corner invasion, but make a very thick left side, look for the center and it압 an attack to the white bottom, but anyway, it압 a bit slugish, so i would play in the area C or even better D to attack marked stone entering in right side, and don앖 care your marked stone, perhaps it has to die, don앖 focus your playing in defending all your stones.]

(;B[dp]C[I figure that if I had tried C3, the game would have gone something like the variation:]
;W[eq];B[fp]LB[fo:A]C[rev: better A, don앖 be greedy, A is more secure because is conected with the group.]
;W[fq]C[Is there any way to stop White from taking the entire third line?

rev: stop?, well, that is another issue, territory versus influence, white is making territory, but your left side is amazing, that will not be my preocupation.]
;B[fd]TR[fp]LB[gp:A]C[I figured I would try to mark out some territory in the top, and maybe be able to use it to extend (eventually) into the center.

rev: sorry but i don앖 like anyway your move!, is so heavy, don앖 run to make territory, it will come to you, playing the marked stone i would play now A, but of course, first would come the right invasion ...]
;W[nc];B[hd]LB[qj:A][qn:B][nq:C]C[rev: if i didn앖 like f16, imagine h16, you should had to play something like A if you are conservative or B or C to open fight with the objective of ruin white territory]
;W[jc];B[kc]C[I wonder if J17 wouldn't have been better since I ended up losing the stone at L17 anyway.  I didn't want White to be able to make two eyes at the top and take the territory I'd tried so hard to gain.]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[id];B[ie];W[kd]C[What am I missing?  When I played H17, I did it to prevent White from extending along the third line.  But that allowed him to cut at J16, and when I played J15 to prevent him from cutting further, he was able to put the K16 stone in atari and eventually capture an entire group starting at L17....]
;B[je];W[kb];B[lc];W[ld]
(;B[ib]LB[lb:A]C[rev: (uf!, you can앖 imagine what a battle i앐 dealing against winmgt) well, there was a lot of possible aims and of course much more possible moves, you choosed killing, ok, but do it right ;-) because your move is a BIG mistake, you should have played A (you could see variations if i win in the battle ...)]
;W[jb];B[lb];W[hb];B[gb];W[ia]
(;B[ga]TR[kc][lc][lb]LB[ka:A][md:B]C[rev: also a big mistake, now you can앖 kill white but white has no room to invade so is a useless move you are not going to kill white (A neither works), you should exchange white life with the escaping of black marked stones with B (see variation)]
;W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[mb];W[mc];B[ha];W[nb];B[ib];W[na];B[ja]
C[rev: now you have played a lot of bad moves, not only useless ones, you have won nothing and white have clear black stones, you should keep your stones on board even if they are dead, they may resucitate somehow, they are a threath and they can produce ko압.]
;W[ch]C[rev: and of course sente has a lot move value ...];B[dh]
;W[ia];B[hb]C[rev: don앖 follow white in such a small battle, secure the white invation or INVADE YOURSELF!!!]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[df]LB[bd:A]TR[dg][dh]C[rev: following the oponent from behind is not a good way (and also a close fight helps the weaker), i would choose A, i don앖 believe white would be able to make two eyes, and even then, i would secure the corner and the marked stones secure also the center]
;W[ce];B[de];W[hq];B[cq]C[rev: you are not a passenger, you are the pilot!, and the board is so large ...]
;W[cr];B[gp];W[gq];B[hp];W[ip];B[io];W[jo];B[ho];W[jm];B[im]
C[rev: there is no sense in defending your territory if you are clearly loosing and here white is making at the same time more territory.]
;W[qf]C[And already the game looks terribly lost for black.  White appears to have the entire upper right corner and the entire lower side, while I've got next to nothing -- maybe the upper left corner if I play it right.

I was able to capture a bunch of White stones later, but that only turned a big loss into a somewhat smaller loss.  And this is the way most of my games go -- I get behind very far at the beginning and afterwards can't figure out where I've gone wrong.  I know that being on IGS I'm probably playing too quickly, but with the time to look at it and comment I still don't know where I'm going wrong.]
;B[cd]C[I might as well try to prevent the group at C15 from making two eyes and taking even more of what ought to be my territory.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[aj];B[ak]LB[bh:A]C[rev: A kills group]
;W[ah];B[ai];W[bh];B[aj]
(;W[ac]C[Now that I look at it, I don't think I could have prevented White from making two eyes.  If white plays B14 here:]
;B[ab];W[ad];B[af]C[I had to play this move, or else B14 for White would have made two eyes.  As it is both groups are dead.]
;W[bb];B[be];W[hi];B[ji]C[I figured the best strategy here was to hem in the white stones towards the rest of mine, so that white wouldn't be able to make two eyes.  However, I still wasn't able to capture more territory on the right side of the board.

rev: this is your best move (and view) in the current game]
;W[mq];B[kg]TR[qf][pp]C[I played this in order to connect the stones at K 11 and K 15, as well as start an invasion into the right side, but it didn't work at all.

rev: and what about the territory between the market stones?]
;W[lg];B[kf]C[rev: well, i see you return to your moto ;-) so i finish the analisys here, as conclusions i would say:

- the board is big
- don앖 just follow the enemy
- don앖 just defend
- don앖 run to make territory
- don앖 be heavy (accumulate stones unnecesary)

and as a conclusion of the conclusion i think your tactics are right, but your strategic concepts are a bit weak, but nobody born been shodan so i hope early you will be teaching me, sorry if i have been too hard, bye. Jorge]
;W[lf];B[ke];W[jk];B[ik];W[ij];B[il];W[ep];B[eo]C[And now Black appears to be even worse off than after my comments following White's move #66.]
