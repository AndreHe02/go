RE[W+3.50]

C[This game was played between zanshin(me) and taivu in KGS 5-9-2004

Result: W+3.5

Especially I would like to know the direction of play and correct order of the moves. Meaning that is the some cases too early,small or in completely wrong direction concerning the whole board situation.

T: I think you have a good sense of the correct direction of play, even if I sometimes give propositions which could be even better.
 Two general hints:
1) Attack earlier. Usually, you gain in influence during an attack. But the value of influence decreases as the position solidifies.
Here in the game, the upper b group was quite strong so it was only possible to attack it after you got a wall to the left. But then, you should not have hesitated to begin with the attack and to continue it.
2) Moves that touch the stones of your adversary are no good attacking moves. They strengthen both sides, and that's what you don't want. 

Btw, as you are unsure about attacking, a good book for you is: Ishida/Davies, Attack and Defense. It's a really marvellous book.

Good luck, and enjoy go!];B[pp];W[dd];B[qd]C[In the game I played D3, however I was also considering to play P16 first. Is that a generally good idea? I know that black has several options to answer that move. But in the best case to have sente after P16 and then still get the corner.

T: An approach move is usually played by W if B has played on the 3-4 point twice. So if B doesn't answer, W can approach the other corner. This is not possible if B plays on the 4-4 or 3-3 point in the fourth corner. p16 would be unusual for these reasons.

Also, the standard joseki is gote for W (see var.)

By the way, Kajiwara recommands d5 in this situation.]

(;W[pl]C[Is the Q8 too passive ?

T: No, without this stone you are very weak on the right side. It's just right, giving you a strong formation.]
;B[jq];W[mc]LB[co:B][jc:A]C[T: This is probably too close to B's strong position. If you want to play in this direction, A would be more natural. 

But making a shimari with B seems bigger to me now.];B[nc];W[md]

;B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[la];B[he]
(;W[ge]C[T: If you want to attack, contact moves are not so good. They strengthen both sides, and you don't want to make your opponent strong.
But B's group is already strong, it's not easy to attack it.]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[cg]
(;W[cj]C[I played pincer here to build potential area into lower left corner. Would the upper corner protection in C15 or C16 be too slow ?

T: By playing c15, you can get a big, secure territory. I'd prefer this move. B has to answer so you can still make a shimari in the lower left.

Also, c10 is a bit far from the corner stone. You are forced to add another stone as soon as possible (see move 44). c9 is the ideal extension but it's not an effective pincer here.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[bc]
(;W[cn]C[Here I was considering in between C6 (played) or B18

T: A difficult choice. I would prefer b18, but it's a bit risky. But after playing c6, you should aim at playing b18 as soon as possible to attack the b group.]

(;W[mq]C[Black has large area in the lower side what would be the best way to reduce or invade to it ?

T: I think the 4th line is better here. You have to prevent the b moyo on the lower left to expand too much.- I have showed two possibilities but I don't know the ideal move.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[or]C[T: It is generally better to run into the center than to seek life on the edge. You risk to get shut in.]

T: Indeed. Your mistakes were
1) to make a too deep invasion
2) to seek live only on the edge.];B[cl]C[T: This is a doubtful move. B gives himself a weakness. While attacking this stone, you should be able to reduce B's moyo. And perhaps you can even get strength which is useful in attacking the b group on the upper side.]

(;W[dm]LB[en:A]C[D8 instead of D7 ?

T: By no means! (see var.)
Your move is good, separating the b stone from his allies (right direction!). But I think A is even better as it intrudes more deeply in the b sphere of influence. When attacking, try to play double purpose moves.]

T: Don't expect too much from an attack now. First, the b group is quite strong and had several possibilities to connect. Second, the territory distribution is already quite definitive so the attack can only have little effects.

Nevertheless, A is a better attacking move.];B[ic];W[kd];B[ke]
