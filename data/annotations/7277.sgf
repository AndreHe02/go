Hello. I think that I had a good game but I did some big mistakes later on. / Marc

Hello. My name is Philipp and my KGS account is Lebertran.
From that game i think you lack on whole board strategy. Moves like 7, 39 or 55 are all wrong direction and would be better placed in an another part of the bord for your whole board position.
I´m sorry for the short comments, but i was very busy this time. But I hope they help you to improve a little bit ;).]
;B[pd];W[cc];B[qp];W[cq];B[oq];W[nc]LB[qj:A]C[Natural for white is a move at A because of the shimari. 
It´s very good for black to occupie this point with an another joseki than in your game.]

(;B[ld];W[ne];B[pf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nb];W[re]
;B[mc];W[rg]C[Now your shimari seems very useless.]
(;B[dd]C[Was is a good approach?

It´s hard to say whether it´s good or not.
This move goes for influence, so if you like influence you can play this move.
But if you can`t handle it you should think about other moves on the left side.]

C[This seems bad.
You choose the same joseki as above and neutralized it at once.
A is now very useless.];W[cj]
(;B[qh]LB[kf:A]C[I don`t like this move. It aims to make territory in the middle at A.
But it´s too small and too wide open . 
If you aim to make territory on the right side you should have played at R10 or R9]
;W[qk]LB[rh:A][qn:B]C[A very nice move from white
A and B are now miai, no chance to attack white]
(;B[qm]C[The good way to counter W?

Better than S12];W[rh]C[White connected now...you can`t do anything-->Tenuki
A move at the bottom is better now.];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[si]

;W[jp]
(;B[hq]C[I don`t like this move. Do you want territory at g3? If you want to destroy the base from white you should attack from the other side because the E4 group is very strong.]
;W[mq]C[White has better chances now to live. H3 was wrong direction.]
;B[kq]C[How to attack W?];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mr];W[mp]C[You just do what white wants. You make him strong on the outside and your wall at R8 becomes very useless.
