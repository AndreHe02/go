C[Hi Johan,  

Attached is my review.  Looking at this game, I tried to comment on what I thought you did right, and what you could improve on.  Overall I think you could benefit from the study life and death ( can't we all), and direction of play.  I also feel that you need to play away (tenuki) more often, especially when your opponent plays first line moves during middle game.  

I enjoyed reviewing your game.  Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.

All of my comments are preceeded by "N"];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc]LB[nq:1]C[N:  I think this move is small for W.  Perhaps you could play something faster.  I like 1.]
;B[fp]C[N: An odd approach move.];W[do];B[cm]
(;W[bn]LB[en:1]C[N: I think this lets him settle to easily.  I like 1.  See variation.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[bm];W[ci]C[I'll happily trade B5 for C11.

N: While I think C11 is probably bigger then B5, there are big endgame moves at A4 or possibly B3. after B5, and the C7 group is pretty stable.  I don't consider this move a mistake, but it is important to keep these things in mind.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[an];W[fr]LB[hp:1]TR[fp]C[N: This move is very small.  The marked stone is quite weak.  Something like 1 looks to be a good move.]
;B[er]C[N: His punishment is harsh.];W[eq];B[fq];W[dr];B[gr]
;W[es];B[hq]C[N: B ended up very well here.];W[kc]C[I have three sides to bother black. I figured this is the best since it makes F17, D18 inefficient.

N: I think the  pincher at H17 is appropriate.];B[ic]C[N:  Now b has stabilized the top group.]
;W[nc]C[N: Good move.  Functions as an extension and an approach.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[ob]LB[pe:1]C[I'm not sure if I should answer this or invade another side.  

N: I think the proper response is at 1.];W[nb];B[na]C[N:  Way too small to respond to. Q15 critical!]

[cs][ds]TR[ea][fa][ga][ha][pa][qa][ra][sa][fb][gb][hb][pb][qb]
[rb][sb][pc][qc][rc][sc][qd][rd][sd][qe][re][se][am][bn]C[N:   B gets really nice territory, and W gets very little in compensation.
By my count, B 27 W 27, but B has a lot more potential territory.]
;W[lq]LB[qh:3][qn:2][nq:1]C[I choose this side to make G2 et al heavy.

N:  Ok, g2 is a pretty flexible shape, and is probably not going to become heavy.   I think I prefer 1 2 or 3.]
;B[nq];W[jq]C[N: I like this move, because it pressures the G3 group while making a small extension from your weak stone.  Always keep an eye out for moves that accomplish two things at once.]
;B[ir]LB[fn:1][io:2]C[N:  I think this is passive for b.  Letting you run out is a mistake.]
;W[jr]LB[kn:1][ko:2]C[N: You can't possibly make life  down there, and there is no way for b to connect underneath.  1 or 2 is very important at this point.]
;B[qo]C[N:  Strong solid move for B.];W[mr]C[Seing how B played this far I figured he would respond to this.

N: I usually get burned badly when I play like that!];B[nr]

[ss]C[
B: 18 top right. 17 bottom right, 7 top, 4 other. Total: 46.
W: Total: 30];W[qj]LB[qh:1]C[I like 1];B[ql]C[N: He should block from the other side, because he now has an "open skirt" on the top.]
;W[qg]C[N: which you take advantage of here.];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[pg];B[sg]C[N:  P14 much bigger, and would work well with O16 group.]
;W[sh]C[N: Way too small!];B[sf]C[N:  P14 still much bigger.]
;W[ri];B[nf];W[jb];B[ib];W[ke];B[ie];W[en]C[Splitting B's groups.

N: Good to get this group into the center.  However both groups are farily strong.  Splitting strong groups has often little effect.]
;B[em];W[fn]C[N: After this move B bottom group looking weaker.]
;B[dj];W[cj]C[N: Ignore and attack with J5.];B[dk];W[ck];B[cl]
;W[fm]LB[di:1][io:2]C[N: I think D11 bigger  j5 also looks quite nice, in that it strengthens your bottom group at the expense of his.]
;B[ho];W[el];B[dl];W[jo]C[N: Finally you get this group out!]
;B[io];W[jn]C[N: Good solid move.  Always try to stay ahead.]
;B[hm]C[Solid]
(;W[fe]C[Perhaps G8 instead, keeping the pressure on B? That would leave F15 to B on the other hand.

I think this move is fine, but you might want to consider playing D11 first.]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[bd]C[N: Probably better At b17.];B[fj]
;W[on]C[N: I would worry about a splitting attack here, but W is behind, so you've got to try something.]

(;B[pn]
(;W[oo];B[np];W[pm];B[qm];W[po];B[qn]C[N: You are making yourself heavy here.  See previous variation.]
;W[op]C[N: I think he can block at P3 here.];B[pq]C[N: Thankfully he can't read as well as I can ;)]
;W[oq];B[or];W[ol]C[N: Saves stone.. for the price of Q9.  I don't think it is worth it.]
;B[pk];W[mn]C[N: Good, run out.];B[mo];W[ln]
(;B[pj]C[N:  A gift for you!.];W[pi]C[N: He helps you protect your weakness.]

N:  I like E12 for w right now,];B[gl];W[eh]C[N: Good, though big end game move at J19 first.]
;B[di];W[dh];B[aj]C[How to stop the monkey jump.  See variation.]

(;W[bi];B[gd];W[bk];B[ak];W[bl]C[N: Bad, because now A11 becomes problematic.  End of commentary.]
