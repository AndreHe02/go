C[BenRoshi [11k\]: hi

-------

thank you for reviewing my game!  As I said in the form, I tried some experimental moves, and tried to think deeper and try and make good shape.
however, things started to crumble after a good play by my oponent.
So I'd like some comments on my moves, how to avoid these kind of weaknesses I had and how I could have played better in general.

Reviewer: hi, i am Michele Baldi, nick Oiotoshi on KGS
Hope to help you];B[dp]C[genx [11k\]: hello there];W[pd]C[genx [11k\]: have a nice game
BenRoshi [11k\]: you too];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[dc]

(;W[ck]C[I think there is a weakness at b6 here, is that something I should worry about?]

(;B[gp];W[bn];B[dn];W[bp]C[Perhaps a bit small now, see var]

(;B[bo];W[ao];B[bq]C[This is quite a big error :-)];W[cp];B[do]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cr];B[dr];W[ds]C[This is small, in fuseki
you should resist and play a big move]
(;B[es];W[cs];B[fr];W[lq]C[I thought this was the best way to make area on the bottom.  I didin't think approaching at a place like o3 would be good, because a pincer could give him big territory.  I figured this way I coudl take out as much as his as possible, and get some for myself.]
;B[jq]C[shoudl he have played at o3 to push me against his thickness?  Or was this the best move?  Just in case I get into a similiar situation ^^

Yes i think O3 is better
K3 dont use well the power of G4 group
with o3 white will find too hard to settle and remain weak]

;W[rq]C[I was pretty unsure of what I was doing on the bottom right.  I thought of going to t4 instead of s3, because then the cutting point at q5 woudl need to be blocked.  But I knew he'd easily block it.  So I played s3 in hopes of cashing in on it another way, er not sure if that was smart though ^^

Now black got a wonderful position
black is incredibly strong outside, and white managed to do so few points]
;B[lp]C[uhm i would have done Q6 instead now,
black  worry so much for a stone
if he escape, he will be without a base and you can get profit attacking it]
;W[mp]C[yeap that was suicidal.  I was hoping to run away with m3 in order to distrupt his thickness.  But now that I look back at it, seems just plain stupid!!!]
;B[np]C[I think this made it a bit more doable though :)];W[mo]
;B[on];W[kp];B[lo];W[ln];B[ek];W[jn]C[is this the best way to get the best and biggest shape and help the ladder?

for white here is good to eat immediatly
no more problems, and a strong formation in a place where black was incredibly strong
so for black is a big loss];B[in];W[im];B[hm];W[io];B[hn];W[il]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[lr];W[kq];B[kr];W[ko];B[hp];W[pj]C[I figured that the l5 stuff was ok now.  So I thought to cash in on the rest of the right side.]

;W[kd];B[kc];W[ne];B[md];W[me];B[le]C[that cutting point hurt, but I think I dealt with it ok right]
;W[nd];B[mc];W[lf]C[here.
but was there a better sequence?];B[ke];W[kf];B[je];W[nk]C[I'm being a bit greedy here, but I figured that there was no way he could take away the stuff around o12 no matter how he invaded so it was an ok move.]
;B[ki]C[this is him trying to invade as any normal person would I suppose ^^
I counted on this, and in the next move I try to surround him, realizing that as long as I had a move like n12 available it was ok.]

was it a bad move because of other reasons though?];B[lk];W[mj]
;B[hi];W[ii];B[hl];W[fj]C[I thought I should buy some more time in teh capturing race and try to build up those two stones.]
