C[z: Review by "zenjutsu" (4k* on IGS).  Please take all comments as they are: I am only 4k, so I cannot guarantee the validity of my commentary, but I hope that it is still of use.  Reviewer's comments will be prefixed with "z:".

z: Overall, this was an excellent game.  There were many opportunities for B to run away with the game, as W appeared to be playing loose early in the game.  However, B made many significant tactical errors in the game allowing W to fortify their weaknesses.  I think W will benefit from making fewer weak groups.  Having more than 2 weak groups on the board at a time is dangerous; having 2 weak groups in the same area is VERY dangerous.  B should have been playing in a more threatening manner, and taking advantage of W's numerous weak stones throughout the game.

z: Please note, I have added many alternative move trees.  The moves displayed in those move trees are merely rough ideas to convey a point, not necessarily suggested moves.

z: Thank you for sharing your game with me.];B[pq];W[dd];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[nd];W[pf];B[pc];W[qc];B[oc]LB[ld:A][qb:B]C[what is the best move ?

z: "B" (R18) is standard joseki.  However, there are always non-standard options (such as "A" at M16), depending upon the circumstances of a given game.  In this situation, I prefer "B".

z: Note that marks "A" and "B" were made by reviewee, not reviewer.]

(;W[ld]C[is this answer how good?

z: The danger of this play is that B can now R18 in sente, which provides life, reduces W's territory, and still allows B to make a response to this stone.]
;B[lc]C[z: This is definitely the wrong play.  B should R18 first.]
;W[kc];B[mc];W[jd];B[gd]LB[qb:C][hc:B][fc:A]C[what is the best move ?

z: I prefer "C" (R18) over either "A" or "B" provided by reviewee. My preference is because it is sente (B must respond, or risk losing top group), it gains territory, it secures W's group, and after it, W can then look at either A or B.]

(;W[fc];B[hc]C[z: This doesn't feel right.  B is playing as if he thinks he can surround and capture W's 3 stones in top center.  He can't.]
;W[dg]C[z: Personally, I prefer a more conservative extension at D14. I am not certain it is better or not, but I prefer the local strength such a 2-space extension would provide locally.]
;B[cc]C[z: This feels like the wrong timing.  B is going to give W a tremendous wall, and W will hurt B severely with that wall.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[ad]LB[if:A][hf:B]
C[what is the best move ?

z: Again, I feel the attack should start with R18.  The reason is that it will close off B's ability to easily make 2 eyes on the top with his MNOPQ group, thus allowing you to attack two groups at the same time.  See alternative move tree for example of play.]

(;W[if]C[as this stone is good];B[ic]LB[gf:A][kb:B]C[what is the best move ?]

(;W[gf]C[z: This play gives life to B too easily.];B[kb]C[z: Now B will connect.]
;W[jb]C[z: Oops.  Free point to B.];B[jc];W[kd];B[ib];W[fq]
C[z: Remember to play R18 when the opportunity presents itself.]
;B[hq]C[z: I'm not certain this pincer is optimal in this situation. However, I'm not certain.  It just feels that the left side is boring due to presence of W's wall, and the Q3 stone is low, thus reducing threat of taking a huge area on the bottom.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[hp]SQ[ip][ho]C[z: This play is not standard joseki.  That does not mean that it is better or worse.  I merely point it out because I am unclear as to why W opted to make a new variation under these circumstances. The two square-marked points are more standard.]
;B[jq]LB[ip:C][nq:A][jp:B]C[what heir for points is the best answer?

z: B's stone doesn't feel right.  I think I would have J4 or E3 in response to W's non-standard play.

z: Regarding reviewee's question about points A and B, I prefer C.  B is too easily cut.  Point A feels like it leaves the three stones too soon.]

(;W[nq]C[lugubre [?\]: no  w
lugubre [?\]: hy];B[lq];W[no];B[po]LB[nq:42][pm:D][nm:C][qm:B]
[om:A]C[what is the best move ?

z: Neither A nor B are good options.  Locally, I prefer C.  Point A is too easily cut.  Point B is merely asking B to seperate W's stones and attack multiple fronts at the same time.  C is another extension which will make W secure.  Of course, playing C will give B time to play D, thus acquiring a large territory. This was a nearly innevitable result of white's choice to play stone 42 at O3.]

(;W[om]C[is R 7  better?

z: No.  See previous comment.];B[qm]C[z: Let's pause to assess the board.  At this point, B has a significant lead.  B holds a small territory in UL corner, a decent territory on the top, a large territory in LR corner, a decent territory on bottom, and a potentially large territory in LL corner.  W has a big wall along top, a decent territory in UR corner, and two weak groups.  While I realize W wins this game, it is primarily due to significant errors by B.  Right now, in my opinion, W is behind by a very large margin: 20 or 25 points.]
;W[ck];B[bl];W[cl];B[cm];W[bk]
(;B[fm]C[z: Wrong direction.  B should threaten the W stones from his bottom group, thus cleanly dividing W's bottom O stones from the left.  Then, B will be able to threaten W's O stones while making significant profit.  That will absolutely end this game. See alternative move tree.]
;W[el]C[z: This is dangerous.  B is attacking your bottom stones.  If he captures, he wins.]
;B[em]C[z: Far too slow a play.  This allows W another chance.]

(;W[hn]C[K4 better ?

z: No.  K4 would get cut apart.];B[gl];W[fk];B[go]C[z: B is trying to get tesuji (skillful play), but this doesn't feel right.  W will get out of the threat too easily.  Threats to a group's life should either be definite (a killing play), or sente (if the opponent does not respond, then you will get in a killing play) and providing profit.  This stone is not a killing play.  It is sente, however it gives B no profit.  Therefore, this play feels too heavy-handed.]
;W[gp];B[gn];W[ho];B[il]
(;W[ko]C[is L4 better ?

z: I'm not certain.  I don't think I like either L4 or this stone. W is unable to kill B's bottom group, and L4 is easily ignored. See alternative move tree.  I'm not certain where I prefer for W to play, but perhaps K6.  The bottom line is that W made two very weak groups, and there are no weak groups for W to lean on to gain strength in his run for freedom.  This was the tactical error that W made on the bottom (as previously discussed).]
;B[hj]C[z: B MUST continue to apply pressure on bottom, and seperate W's two groups.  B can make enormous profit and ensure victory, or possibly even kill one of the groups (although that is not even remotely necessary to win this game).]
;W[fi]C[z: Not necessary.  However, since B gave you a chance to play on bottom, you can use it to ensure the life of your groups. You are very fortunate B does not kill one of them.]
;B[pk]C[z: Wrong timing.  First threaten to seperate bottom two groups, then acquire this territory.]
;W[qi]C[z: Again, the bottom stones need strengthening first.]

(;B[rj]C[z: This does not matter right now.  THREATEN TO KILL THE BOTTOM! See alternative move tree.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[ri]C[z: ?  Much too small.  Save your bottom stones before B kills them.]
;B[np]C[z: This method of attack feels too convoluted.  I think B has been watching a lot of high-dan games lately.  9p's might make moves like this, but they do so because they are reading out the results 20 or 30 stones down the road.  As mid-level kyu's, we can't read that far ahead, and should only make such tesuji plays when they are certain to benefit us in one manner or another.]
;W[mp];B[op];W[mq];B[mr];W[nr];B[ms];W[ns];B[kr];W[qs]C[z: You must ensure your life first.  Right now, B has a good chance of seperating W, and possibly killing one of the two groups (FGH or NOP).  W must focus on running out of the net and/or making eyes.  Trying to reduce B's territory is useless if your group that is reducing is going to die.]

(;B[rr]C[z: Nope.  R2 was the play.];W[qr];B[qq];W[pr]C[z: B's errors are giving easy life to W.]
;B[nn];W[mn];B[nm];W[oq];B[pp];W[ol]C[z: Saving the P7 stone might not be worth the effort.]
;B[ih]C[z: This stone doesn't seem to accomplish much.];W[fe]

;B[is];W[dq];B[bq];W[hm];B[hl];W[gm];B[fl]C[what is the best move ?

z: Locally, I prefer E9.  Capturing the two stones is only worth 4 points (2 prisoners, 2 territory).  E9 appears to be more than that.]

(;W[fn]C[is E9 better ?];B[ek];W[dj];B[fj];W[ej];B[gk];W[jo]
C[z: This stone (as well as the next few) don't do anything.  They are the same as passing.  This stone is connecting two alive groups to each other.  It doesn't threaten B's life, or reduce B's territory.  It does not provide life to an otherwise dead W group, nor give W territory.  It is the same as a pass.]
;B[mg];W[kg];B[mf];W[pb]C[z: Finally, a play worth points.  However, the wrong play.  R18 was the right point.]

(;B[ob]C[z: Wrong place.  R16/18 were the points to punish W for his overplay.]
;W[qb];B[od];W[pe];B[ne]C[z: Both players make a lot of "pass" plays like this.  Stones need purpose when they are played.  Valid purposes include:

1. Make territory.
2. Reduce the opponent's territory.
3. Make a group stronger so it has guaranteed life.
4. Threaten to kill the opponent.
5. Kill the opponent.
6. Connect a threatened 0-eye or 1-eye dragon to another group to make a living group.
etc...

z: This play is none of the above.  It is the same as a pass.]
;W[gb]C[z: Good.  Gain territory, and stop the opponent from gaining it.]
;B[ie];W[je]C[
here black lost. It used too much time. are the white stones better than the black? Points would the play have won?

z: I'm not entirely clear on who is ahead at this point.  I'm not always the best at counting score, but I think W is up by a bit.  However, there were far too many opportunities for B to end this game early.  W's loose early play gave B the opportunity to run away with the game.  

z: I feel that W will best strengthen their play by reconsidering the reason for each stone, and avoiding making weak groups.  If W makes this one change in tactics, then their play is sure to improve by a few stones in strength.  I look forward to seeing W's strength continue to grow!

z: Thank you for sharing your game with me.  I hope my comments have been valuable.]
