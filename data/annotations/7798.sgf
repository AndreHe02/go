C[Hi, I'm dancor, 5k on KGS.  I didn't see any comments so I'll give a general review on the parts of this game that jump out at me.  I'll prefix my comments with "dc:".  I have some closing advice in my last comment.  Let me know if you have any questions.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp]C[Adam1 [11k?\]: hi];B[co]C[dc: This is good, this is the right corner to play in at this point.]
;W[dj];B[jd];W[qj];B[ep];W[dp]
(;B[eo]C[dc: This is unusual.  After wD5 bD6 you are more separated locally than you had to be, with two cutting points at C6 and E6.  The simple separated pattern bC5 wD5 bE5 is something you should definitely avoid.  It is better (and actually joseki) to go with one cutting point and end up with a crosscut after bD5, see variation.  Even thinking about separation on this very local level will improve your game tremendously.]
;W[fq];B[ho];W[do];B[dn];W[cm];B[cn];W[cf];B[ci]C[dc: It's not clear that it's a good idea to live under white and give him a solid fourth-line wall that counters the fourth-line influence of your three star-point stones at the top.  White does end up blundering in this exchange though.  In any case, playing in the other big open areas first is better before pursuing this idea.  Most critically here though, the cutting point at E6 is glaring!  You do end up playing bF7 later before white can cut, but then you don't maintain the defense against that cut.   Think about connection early and _then_ use the resulting strength for attacks.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[cg]
(;W[df]C[dc: i like wD13 better for the same reasons as before.]
;B[bf];W[be];B[ag];W[cj];B[dg]C[dc: wC10 is a move to put pressure on black but is unrealistic given the cutting points left behind.  I hope you can feel the way pushing through and cutting like this shreds white apart; do it more often and don't like white do it to you!]
;W[eg];B[ce];W[de];B[cd];W[ah];B[ai];W[ae];B[bd];W[bi];B[bh]
;W[ff];B[fd];W[hp];B[io];W[ip]C[dc: You don't want to push white along the fourth line which is called the "line of victory" in such a pushing battle.  At that height, white gets more for the territory than you do for the influence.  It's harder to invade under fourth line stones than fifth or higher as well.  Also, despite white messing up tactically on the left side, the influence you get is also still being weakened by his strong wall!]
;B[fm];W[go];B[gn]C[dc: You are being pushed around here.  White is making territory and you are doing nothing.  Also white got to play "hane at the head of two stones".  A black play at bG4 or bK4 before this is more active.]
;W[fo];B[il];W[fn];B[em];W[en];B[hn]C[dc: This makes an empty triangle.  bG7 or H7 is more efficient.  bG7 seems less susceptible to being peeped and harrassed later on, and it does more in the battle of influence against the white wall on the left.  Also, you do end up playing it much later, but I think you should play D7 soon which is very scary for white to play; even if the bC6 chain can live after it, it's still a kind of "double sente" play.]
;W[kp]C[dc: White is relentlessly cashing in on fourth-line territory.  Invading later around bO3 might be called for to fight to offset it.  But waiting to see the territory balance later in the game is reasonable, since such invasions tend to generate influence for the opponent (which is more valuable earlier in the game) and can be risky (but it's correct to take risks when you are down, and only then).]
;B[kn];W[kc];B[jc];W[lc];B[nc];W[le]C[dc: White has played too slowly and solidly in a hostile area, and you have done a good job of making him heavy (running into the center without eyes) while strengthening your adjancent areas.]
;B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[gd];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc];W[fe];B[ed];W[lg]
;B[qf]C[katari [11k\]: hi];W[qc];B[pc]C[dc: It's important to plan and have reasonable expectations to maximize the effect of your tactical ability.  As you play out a corner sequence like this you should think about if you are trying to kill or enclose or what.  Generally bO17 bQ16 bR15 can hold the corner and kill.  Here we have bO17 bQ16 bR14 which is only a little bit looser.  So we should not aim to kill but do the next strongest thing which is enclose the corner on _both_ sides.]
;W[qb]C[dc: When your opponent is under heavy fire in a tight area like this, it will often happen that when he plays in one direction/side he leaves a weakness in the other.  It can be hard to not immediately respond in the direction he has played and instead look around to his flank weakness.]
(;B[pb];W[re];B[qd];W[rd]
(;B[qa]C[dc: This move would only make sense in a plan to kill white or force him to run out in a way that is advantageous (not along the side to a friendly stone, grabbing side territory and helping strengthen the bottom right area).  A killing plan is too aggressive, certainly by now but even earlier.  Even now bQ13 is interesting for an enclosure plan.]
;W[rf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[mi];W[ii];B[kh]
C[dc: White made a huge blunder by not thinking about connection in the large scale for his weak heavy stones, and you correctly punish that.]

;B[mh];W[nm];B[ok]C[dc: This helps white secure a huge corner area for little gain.  And invasion or reducing starting from bL6 earlier is a more profitable idea.]
;W[ol];B[lo];W[lp];B[mo];W[qq]
(;B[no]C[dc: This is too slow.  White is keeping a huge amount of territory with few stones or effort.]

;W[lm];B[km];W[kl];B[kk];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk]LB[nj:A]
(;B[nj];W[pj];B[jl];W[kj]C[dc: bM8 is better.  But your endgame play is generally better than white's, so I'll end my comments here.  To improve the most I think you should focus on local shapes certainly like avoiding local disconnections and cutting points.  For your attacks you should also think about the proper severity (Am I too weak to kill but strong enough to enclose both sides?  Or only one side?) and direction (Can I be slightly less aggressive locally and actually build strength toward a more important area of the board?) and timing (don't start the middle game in the opening).  You should also think more generally about getting to open spaces while they are still open, or even later if you have to (especially since your tactical ability seems to be higher than your opponents, you just tend to fight with unprofitable strategic ideas, so locally winning can still mean globally losing).]

(;B[oo]C[dc: White cannot cut a one-space jump, for example.  Faster looser moves like this all do more to threaten the inefficiently empty triangle wO8 chain and then threaten to break into white's territory in more places.]

(;B[ap]))
(;B[pg];W[rg];B[rf];W[sf];B[rh];W[sh]C[dc: This could lead to a ko for enclosure when even loosing the ko is only as bad for black as what happened in the game.]
))
(;B[qd]C[dc: This is a huge move, enclosing the corner on both sides and making white struggle to live while making black very outwardly strong against the weak white stones to the left and against wR10 so that black is threatening to pour into the open area in the bottom right side.  The only thing to think about in this move is the response wP18, but shallow reading shows that it cannot actually do anything scary like cut black or connect to the left.
Also the bend shape of bQ17 bQ16 bR16 around the white stones is very strong in many contexts.]

;W[md];B[pb]))
(;W[pb];B[nd]C[dc: This bamboo connection is very strong and uncuttable.  Black is sticking to the original plan of enclosing the corner from both sides -- the next best thing after killing (which is needlessly aggressive here and not realistically attainable).]

(;W[dg];B[df];W[de];B[ef];W[cd];B[ee];W[ce]C[dc: There is a lot of potential for exchange of territories and influence in this kind of fighting.  But since black has to worry so much about bC13 living when white fights back it seems like black's original plan with bC11 was heavy or at least risky and so maybe better played only if black ended up being down after plays in the other big open areas of the board.]
))
(;B[do];W[eo];B[fp];W[en]C[dc: This pinwheel shape is often the best way  to continue after a crosscut.  Black having sente in the fight is good as well.]
;B[bq];W[fr];B[gq]C[dc: There is an interesting fight going on now.  This is better than letting white split you further apart as in the game.  The wD4 group has to think about life while life seems easier for the bD5 group.]
