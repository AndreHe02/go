;W[jc];B[hc];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[le]LB[kd:a]C[Q: Should B have played Q14 instead?

That's what I would have done, after which White would play 'a' (L16) to capture the Black M17 stone (though that stone would still have chances to escape).

Allowing White to play Q14 is unpleasant because it surrounds, and threatens to kill, your corner, strengthens the White stones and puts White into a position where he can make territory on the right side.]
;W[pf]C[Q: What should B do in this situation?

Not get into it in the first place :-). Black could now play the 3-3 point to live in the corner, leaving the possibility of cutting the White stones apart for later.]
;B[qe];W[je]LB[qf:a][pb:b]C['a' is very big on the right, and threatens to kill the Black corner by playing 'b'.]
;B[lg]LB[rg:a][jb:b]C[I think I'd rather play 'a' (S13) to prevent the corner stones getting surrounded; this also makes it difficult for White to make territory on the right. You'll still have the jump to M13 or that attachment at 'b' (K18) to make use of the M17/M15 stones.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[id]LB[qf:a]C[Should still be at 'a' (R14); White's given you the chance to get both your weak groups out into the open.]
;B[qf];W[ng]
(;B[kb]LB[qh:a]C[This looks a little slow, and isn't necessary to stop White connecting his two groups (see variation on previous move). White might ignore your move and play something like 'a' (R12), turning the right edge into a Whtie moyo. If you then play K18 to connect your weak group to safety, White will be able to take another big point. As Black, I'd play 'a' (R12) myself here.]
;W[jb]C[Notice that the L18/K18 exchange has weakened Black's top left position.]
;B[jg];W[hg];B[if];W[hf];B[ki];W[ph];B[pg]LB[rh:a]C[As you discover, this doesn't help. I'd just play at 'a' (S12) to make some territory (and eye space) and keep encroaching on the right edge.]

;W[or];B[qr];W[nq]LB[qo:a][qn:b]C[Q: Where should B play next?

(White should have played 'a' here - it's sente to kill the corner.)

If Black plays 'b' (R6) immediately, White will probably exchange Q6 for R7 and then start an attack on the weak Black group. In this case, Black has about 10 points in the bottom right, 5 in the top right and about 40 in the top left, for a total of 55. White has maybe 10 points in the centre plus 5 komi, and so needs 40+ points from the attack plus the lower left corner. Given that White will probably come out of that attack with sente to play the big move in the corner (because Black will have to live), this looks promising for White.

Playing move that strengthens your group and moves into the White moyo, e.g. L7, is probably too slow. White will play 'a' in sente; your score will be similar, but White will have added about 15 poitns on the right. That leaves him needing only 25 or so from the bottom edge and centre, which doesn't look too difficult.

So, a fairly deep invasion of the White moyo may be the only way to try for a win here. The difficulty will be in not allowing the invasion or the weak group to die in the process!]

;W[jq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gn]C[Now your group looks like it should live and we can get an estimate of the score (assuming White gets sente to play in the bottom left corner):

Black
  top left - 42 points
  bottom right - 6 points
  top right - 6 points
  total - 54 points

White
  centre - 5 points
  right edge - 15 points
  bottom edge - 45 points
  komi - 5.5 points
  total - 70.5 points

After White takes the bottom left, you'll have sente, but your still 10 points or so behind.]

[so:d][sn:e]C[Q: How's the situation now? Is it even, B lead or W lead? How should B have played the next few endgame sequence?

Black
  top left - 48 points
  centre - 7 points
  bottom right - 6 points
  top right - 6 points
  total - 67 points

White
  centre - 8 points
  top & right - 17 points
  bottom edge - 47 points
  komi - 5.5 points
  total - 77.5 points

There are big, and fairly simple, endgame points at 'a' (R18), 'b' (J18) and 'c' (B5). From Black's point of view, 'a' looks like about 6 points reverse sente, 'b' is similar and 'c' is 7 or 8 points in sente.

The interesting area is the bottom right. 'd' is White's sente because it threatens to kill the corner; the question is, can Black play 'e' in sente? The danger is that White will throw in at 'd' and get a ko anyway. However, it looks like Black can get another eye on the edge (or escape) if White tries this - see the variation. If the variation is correct, Black should play 'e' first because this area is double sente (sente for both players).]

(;B[ol];W[om]LB[sn:a]C[You have to be careful here, because strengthening White makes the ko in the bottom right more dangerous. This may prevent you from playing 'a' (T6) in sente.]
;B[qb];W[bo]LB[so:a][ga:b]C[Q:Does B still have a chance to win at this stage? Are there any endgame sequence error I made in the remaining moves?

(White should play the sente moves at 'a' (T5) and 'b' (G19) before playing here.)

My estimate of the score now:

Black
  top left - 46 points
  top right - 11 points
  bottom right - 6 points
  centre - 7 points
  total - 70 points

White
  centre - 8 points
  top & right - 15 points
  bottom - 52 points
  komi - 5.5 points
  total - 80.5 points

You have sente to play the hane on the right (if you want to risk the ko) or to block the monkey jump at 'b', so the margin is probably 6 or 7. However, there doesn't seem to be much chance of you catching up.]

;W[ek];B[os]C[Q: Is B P1 better or B6 or any other play better?

B6 looks like the biggest move left (3 points gote), but P1 is a mistake - see later.]
;W[ns];B[ps]LB[rr:a]C[Now White can play at 'a' (S2) and reduce the corner to a seki - see variation.]

(looks like I've forgotten a prisoner somewhere)

You caught up in the endgame, mainly due to getting the reverse sente move at J18 and White not spotting the various possibilities in the corner.]
