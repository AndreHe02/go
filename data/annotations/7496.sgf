C[Hi i am david. Im playing white. I think that had problems with reducing territorial framework of my opponent. It is maybe that my fuseki was wrong. I dont know.

Thanks for review.];B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ed]C[Abersia: Since it seems that you feel uncomfortable invading/reducing enemy frameworks, it is probably best to try one of these alternatives:]

(;W[qf]C[Abersia: The problem with this direction is that many joseki that b can chose often emphasize the left side.]

(;W[dl]LB[dn:A][cq:B]C[Abersia: The move at D8 prompted for Black to jump up and increase his framework. Also, there are weaknesses at both 'A' and 'B' to worry about later. I would consider this a 'Thank You' move if I was Black, since it helps Black create the framework that he wants.]
;B[fj]SQ[nc][qc][cd][ed][pd][dj]C[Now it looks so solid that i have just no idea how to do something with it.

Abersia: The move at D8 prompted for Black to jump up and increase his framework, see the previous move for more explanation.]
;W[jp];B[jd]
(;W[qo]C[Abersia: This move contradicts the purpose of playing the 4-4. If you were going to seal the corners, it's better to just play the 3-4 (so the corner enclosure is more solid), in my opinion. With the 4-4, you must understand that the 3-3 invasion will be possible most of the game. It may be better to simply build a big framework of you own and let the influence of the 4-4 stone help you out. See the previous variation:]
;B[of]
(;W[fl];B[pj];W[pi];B[mj]LB[mh:B][jj:A]C[Abersia: It may be better to jump right in to the framework before it solidifies. 'A' and 'B' are two points to consider.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[oi];B[ml];W[ol]C[Abersia: Instead of M7, it may be even better to simply O12 and seal the border.]
;B[lm]C[Abersia: As White has sente and Black's framework is closing up, it's absolutely critical to reduce Black's framework before it solidifies into territory. There are several points to consider, but none of them seem to do enough at this point without getting into more complex sequences. It was probably better to invade before it reached this point.]

Abersia: If there are not enough threats for you to win the ko (which I think is true), then I agree that you should have taken the ko. The P11 group should live anyway and you would have a solid base from which to further reduce Black's framework.]
;W[qg];B[dj];W[jc];B[ek]C[now i feel that  it was better to take ko.

;B[lf];W[fq]C[equal?

Abersia: I think it's more or less equal, although there are many points still left up to grab.

Black has:
 About 40 points or so for the left group.
 About 25 points for the top-right group.
 Potential for more solid territory in the top-left (a move around the G13 area would work) and possibly the center.

White has:
 About 5-10 points for the top group.
 About 10 or so points for the left corner.
 About 16 points in the right corner.
 About 30 or so points on the right side.
 Potential for territory on the bottom.];B[cp];W[cq];B[co];W[bq]

;B[jo];W[io];B[ho];W[ko];B[jn];W[kp]C[Abersia: Again, you need to watch out for Black creating a big framework. He has sealed you in, so he's a couple moves away from grabbing a huge center.]
;B[om];W[pm];B[pn];W[pl];B[on];W[qn];B[ep];W[eq];B[kn]C[Abersia: Here is your best chance to tenuki. In fact, it's even possible to tenuki before, but here is where you would lose minimal points. (This also means that Black L6 was too small a move) As Black is 3/4ths of the way to secure a big 20-30+ point center, it's very important to reduce it before it is sealed.]

(;W[lo];B[mo];W[mp];B[ih]C[I wanted to play a move like j11 but i havent enough time. I think i should play k13 now not o8.

Abersia: One thing to keep notice of is the overall development of the entire board. You don't want to overdo it and throw stones in the opponent's area (as all you're doing is creating weak groups to be attacked), but you also don't want to  All too often Black seemed to find a way to create these massive frameworks which White had to find a way to reduce or invade (and once the framework is formed, it becomes pretty hard). Nevertheless, White was never incredibly behind and played pretty solidly. The probe at C17 worked out well and you had a sharp eye in catching it.

Also, as a side note: I believe it should be B+16,5. (See previous variations)]
)
(;B[np];W[dd]C[Abersia: Black cant decide to ignore this move, but White can gain a lot more if the F17 group is killed. It is a very complex situation, so if White doesn't profit from D16, then W should have just M3.]
