C[BenRoshi [10k\]: hi
----------
BenRoshi [10k\]: alright this is a game between me (white) against some ? player
BenRoshi [10k\]: I think I played ok in some aspects, and I found ti hard to find some real flaws in my playign without lots of questions.
BenRoshi [10k\]: there are a few questions I have throughout the game, but any move you think I could have done better with would be appreciated]

Up to this point the game looks straight out
of a beginner's book.  Good I suppose, but
it sets up a game with no chances taken and
no surprises.];W[mc]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: Didn't want him to have full control of that side so this was my shot at breaking it apart.  Was there a better way?

The other obvious choice is R6 or R7,
but this looks OK too.];B[oc];W[jb];B[jc]C[sai035 [?\]: how  long  U play?

the corner near c4 is still weak, I think

;B[os]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: to tell you the truth, I am suprised I was able to live on the bottom right heh.  Can you show me a way for black to kill?  And was there a better route to life?]
;W[ns];B[nj]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: He should've played n3 instead I think, or is o10 bigger?

I agree N3 is huge, because it is also sente,
and this isn't particularly effective in making
the side territory bigger.];W[mp]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: well I figured this would prevent n3 and is sente so why not]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[gc]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: I have no idea where that move came from, it just sorta called out to me lol

Intuitively, it looks wrong to me, but if
you saw a particular outcome you likedm
I suppose it would be ok even if it turns
out to be a mistake.

I would say this forces black to cover
his weakness at J17, which is easily
done and leaves white's attacking stone
very weak.];B[gb];W[ec];B[hc];W[gd];B[fd];W[ge];B[eb];W[db]
;B[ed]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: how long have you played?];W[dc];B[ef]
;W[fe]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: probably should've ran some more right here, or played d15 instead.  What do you think?

The three stones (now 4) look very shakey.  B F15 where
will they live?

Sometimes it's better to just abandon a
failed idea. In this case, press in from K14
to minimize the damage.];B[ee];W[kf]C[sai035 [?\]:  about  3 years]

I think this is the wrong continuation for
white.  It looks ugly, and leaves the corner
very shakey.  You may have to give up the
two stones, but much better than the whole 
corner.];B[dh];W[ci];B[cm]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: yikes more attacks on the left :(

See my earlier comment, you should have
played in this cornet before starting on
the right.];W[cl];B[dl];W[ck];B[dn];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn]C[Good move.  Obviously white was expectingE7]

;B[fn];W[dk];B[bc]C[Nice thought.  White is almost toast.];W[bb]

(;B[ae]LB[de:A]C[not quite good enough.  I think a different
variation would be successful, starting at A
instead.  I think white dodged a bullet by 
sheer luck.];W[bd];B[ad];W[cc];B[ac];W[de]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: was there a way black could have killed me?  And was there a way to get more points here?]

(;W[hm]C[BenRoshi [10k\]: I'm trying to close off the area around k5, but that's too high I realize now

Taking stock at this point the game is
really about over.   H6 would be better 
but the area can be reduced from the top
too.]

BenRoshi [10k\]: do you know how I could have played better?

I see a few tactical errors, but the overall
play is pretty solid.  I especially noted the
generally conservative lines of play.  If
anything, white should be evern a little
more conservative - the places you got
into trouble (upper-left especially) were
where you were a little loose.])

White is ok now, but black can still reduce
the cornet a lot, and white's territory toward
the middle is compromised by pressure points
at A and B, so I think the best would be
to seal the corner.]
