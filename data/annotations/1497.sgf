C[Note that I'll be using a grid ref system (ie 2
numbers) as my editor has no letters to read by.
So 10-10 is the center, bottum center is 10-4, right
side center is 16-10 etc.  This is just to make it
extra confusing and difficult for you :)];B[pd]C[ Kidding of course.

On with the review.];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp];B[oq];W[lp];B[np]C[low continuation for black and too concentrated...]
;W[pn]C[good way to take advantage];B[qr];W[qj]C[Perhaps a bit further on the extension.  Possibly
into an attack on the other corner top right.  If
black puts presurre on your bottum right corner
from above you run to the center which puts even
more pressure on his bottum right group, so you
can afford some daring do here.];B[ip];W[ko]C[You weren't sure of this move and rightly so.  I
might even leave it for later to respond.  Bigger
things to do right now.   Another option is 13-3
(add pressure to his black group) then run with
12-6 to the center.  Or just run to the center at
12-6.];B[eq]C[Blacks getting away with things he shouldn't be
able to.];W[gq]C[I think strengthen your corner first off then worry
about invading this group.  If you are able to keep
your corner strong, black will have two weak
groups on the bottum edge.  You can come back
later and attack one of these groups, which will
strengthen your position between them which can
lead to an even harsher attack on the other.  this
position is good for you if you keep your corner
strong.

Another thing about this play is how low it is.
Your playing into a tight black position and you
can't really hope to live here so you play on line
up so you can run to the center easier.];B[do];W[cm]C[Becareful not to end up with everything
disconnected.  as I see it you have 5 different
groups along the bottum edge and each of them is
weak, mostly because they aren't connected.];B[gp]C[Now the lowness of that stone is exploited.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq];B[fq];W[jp]C[And its life costs you a bit.  A weak and trapped
corner.  And a drifting position on the other side of
a strong black wall.];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cn];W[dp];B[ep]
;W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[fp]C[Black blunder.  He can leave that for later and kill
your corner here.];W[dr];B[er];W[br];B[dq];W[cr];B[cq];W[bq]
;B[gn];W[mq]C["Question hand? Maybe I should play R14 or
K17?"

Play bigger.  Blacks ahead of you by a bit.  that
groups life is fine for now.  Attack a corner, reduce
blacks walls efficiency, mainly think BIG.];B[kq];W[jq];B[rq]
;W[rp];B[id]C[Oh shit!  This is what I hear you saying now,
because its what I would say.  Black reconciled
his weak positions on the bottum and now has a
sen ren sei on the top edge.  Your way behind,
there are other factors but 13-3 is the most recent
and most direct.  It gave black sente and he used
it to gain up top and confirm life got the bottum
right.  blah!];W[qf];B[qh]C[I'm a bit surprised by this on blacks part.  Playing
into a pincer can be dangerous.];W[of];B[oh];W[nd]C[I like this corner attack.  One of my favorties.  May
be incorrect some how but it accomplishes the
goal of trapping the corner and possibily killing it.];B[ql]
C[Now blacks getting reckless.  I would cap him at
16-8.  Black is sueing for a fight give him one.
and make it good.  You may lose but you'll learn
more than simply running.];W[oj]C[like this.];B[mh];W[ol]C[cap right at 16-8 now and theres no play left in the
black stone.  As it stand here there is
somethings he can try to gain a pushin to that
area later.  Looking at the next position too this
move may even be supurflous.  playing in the top
right might be more important.];B[ne]
(;W[pc]C[Bad Bad!!  When close fighting he who can keeps
most connected usually wins.  So prevent
connection where you can and stay connected
where you can.  This is a gift for Black.  See
variant.  It may not be best play but the situation
is salvagable.];B[oe]C[Ah black knows the rule.];W[qd]C["Question hand? Maybe I should play R17?"

yes I think r17 would have worked better here.
Your can't play loosely around strength unless
your strong also and your not in this area.];B[qc];W[pe];B[od]
;W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[qe];B[pb];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[sb]
;W[re];B[qa];W[me];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf];W[nh];B[jf]
;W[og]C[Quick estimate after that exchange.  Blacks area
extends to the 6th line and yours to the 5th.  It
includes two white groups while your no has 3
black stones.  Black has sente.  Black has the
corner.  Along with his unchallenged corner and
large wall in the bottum left he is in the lead.];B[ec]C[There are better sente plays here but this is still
not good for you.];W[lg];B[kf];W[bm];B[an];W[dm]C["Bad move, I should play C10 or C11?"

Bad move because it doesn't need a response.
C10 and C11 are too low.  Life will be difficult here
so make a run for it and cut off that group by
running to your forces on the other side of the
board.  4-10 or 4-11 would be best.];B[di];W[bi]C[Too low can't make life here.  Run to the other
side and try to surround the big group in the
bottum left.  You must be bold or lose.];B[ch];W[bh];B[bg]C[Black simply completes enclosure of top left and
you continue to think your group can live.];W[dj];B[ej];W[ci]
;B[dh];W[dk];B[ii]C[Now he has a large bit of the center.];W[qq]
;B[rr];W[pq];B[pr];W[nr];B[or];W[sq];B[nn];W[lm];B[nl];W[om]
;B[ln];W[mo]C[Not good.  See all the cutting points it provides
black.  12-3 12-5 13-4  he uses them for life.  11-6
enclose enemy and make outer wall.];B[mp];W[lo];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[nq];W[mr];B[kr];W[jr];B[ks];W[js];B[no];W[mn]C[14-7 is best followed by 11-6.  Better shape for
you.];B[nm];W[lk];B[po];W[qo];B[ok];W[pk];B[on];W[qm];B[pp]
;W[jc]C[This is hopeless!  The attack should have come
ages ago.  Now it is too late.];B[ic];W[ib];B[kb];W[gb];B[jb]

(;W[ji]C[5-9 is becoming a big point for you both now.
Play it!  Blacks group is dead as it stands (I am
90% sure, haven't played out all variations) so let
black make more mistakes.];B[ih];W[hm];B[gm];W[fl];B[hn];W[gl]

;B[es];W[gr];B[em];W[am]C[Why not 5-8?  prevents whole next sequence
which is very costly for you.];B[go];W[eo];B[el];W[ek];B[dl]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[cl]C[Bad move, I should play C10, then black dragon die?]
;B[ik]
(;W[cj]C[Your kidding right?  Did you read at all?  What
happens if you play at 11-9?  Atari on those two
blacks!  You live either way, but black dies in one.
See variant.];B[hk];W[fk];B[kk];W[ag];B[bf];W[sr];B[rs];W[ao]

;B[gs];W[da];B[cb];W[fs];B[qn];W[rn];B[gs];W[oo];B[op];W[fs]
;B[ms];W[ls];B[os];W[gs];C[Firstly at this point black wins by 16.5pts.  The
group in the top left of yours is dead and that is
too costly.  Your beginning play was redeemed
some what by middle game when you nearly
caught those two groups (recall the double attack I
mentioned towards the beginning of the reivew).
You in fact did catch one but only through
extereme neglegance on blacks part.
Unfortunately you failed to kill the group in the
end and that cost you the game.

Black over all was reckless and you were blow
away by his seeming unstoppableness in the
start.  you recovered somewhat.

For future study investigate proper shape and
strength.  Also Pick up some stuff on opening
theory and joseki.  Beware of simply memorizing
the joseki, one must try and understand them
before they can be used properly.

Finally understand I am far from perfect myself so
if you think I am wrong or have questions please
contact me.  I would very much like to hear from
you either way as learning is always a two way
street.  If you like send me this sgf file again with
your comments on what I said and anything else
you can think of.

Hope this helps.
