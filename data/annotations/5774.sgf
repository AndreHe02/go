AB[dp][pd]C[Hi,
My name is Avi;
I am an Israeli player, 3K on IGS.
We do not have a big difference in strength, so take my review with 'a grain of salt'.
My comments will have the "A:" prefix.

See a summary at the end.
I would appreciate your feedback for the review at avibn@yahoo.com.

Hope this review is useful for you!];W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[qn];W[ql];B[on]C[Would a double approach at O3 been better?

A: P6 seems OK to me. In response to O3, White will play Q6 and then Black O3 will have to struggle for life as White's F3 group is very stable.]
;W[np];B[pl]C[A: I would play Q9 sequence, forming a wall towards the center and let White live small on the side. This would work well with the Black stone on the other sides.]
;W[cf];B[cj]C[A: This seems wrong to me for several reasons:
- First, White tenukied on the right side so Black could gain a big advantage by paying for example R9.
- Second, The C6 group was not threatened by C14, so the extension was not really necessary - the rule is to respond on the weak side and push the opponent towards your thickness.
- If you decide to play on this side, than apply full pressure by pincering on C12. White will have a pain to decide to to invade the corner, letting you dominate the left side or run away and let Black chase him and gain territory.]
;W[bd]C[A: In view of my previous coments, I would play F17 as White. C14 has still room to maneuver since C10 is far away, and in the meantime White can establish a base on the top.]
;B[cc];W[ch];B[ef]C[A: I do not like very much this and next 2 Black moves. Black does not really gain anything apart from strengthening White.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[dh];B[ce];W[be];B[hd];W[nd];B[qf];W[pk];B[ol]
C[Would cutting at R9 have produced better results for black or would white benefit instead?

A: Since Black did not take advantage of White tenuki so far, P8 is reasonable - White needs now to make an effort to live and he will pushed against the stabe Black's corner.]
;W[qj];B[qh]C[A: Wrong direction. Better utilize White position to build a wall towards the center, e.g. P9. R14 is not under danger, and the extension of R12 is too small. Now White moves into the center and P8 group looks under pressure.]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[nj];B[mn]C[I think playing at M6 would've been better. With this it looks like black is being too conservative.

A: generally I agree, although there is no much damage with N6.]
;W[lp];B[rp];W[jc]C[A: White likes to tenuki at the wrong moments... R3 would keep the pressure on Black and secure the corner which is big.]
;B[je]C[Perhaps the iron pillar at H17 was better.

A: Yes; This would force White to protect K17 group, and then Black can sieze the opportunity to play R3.]
;W[hb];B[gc];W[kd];B[pc]C[A: Again, the way to attack is from the weaker side, which is G18. White will have to defend, and then Black can secure the other side. Now White reduces Black's territory with a lot of compensation on the other side.]
;W[gb];B[fb];W[de];B[ee];W[cd];B[ec];W[fd]C[A: This seems to me aji-keshi (losing a future potential to gain nothing.]
;B[ed];W[cl];B[dk];W[dl];B[fj];W[cr];B[en];W[el];B[gn];W[bj]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[bk];W[ej]C[I think W63 would've been better played at d10. He could cut black and make B54 weak. The left black group would also be struggling for life.

A: I agree.];B[ek];W[ck];B[dj];W[fk];B[ei];W[fh];B[gj];W[fm]
;B[gk]C[A: Again... Attack from the weak side! Now E9 group is strong, so just connct on F6!]
;W[fn];B[fo];W[em];B[eo];W[gm];B[hn];W[hm];B[eq];W[er];B[gq]
;W[gr];B[fp];W[fr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ip]C[A: In this sequence Black plays sente moves, but forms a bas shape for his stones. Especially the last stone should be on J6.]
;W[in]C[A: White immediately forces Black into a bad shape...]
;B[io]C[A: This is bad. If Black does not cut at J7 he admits that he played badly below. I did not calculate tothe end, but seems to me Black's F5 group is strong enough to live, so the burden will be on White to save his G7 group.]
;W[jn];B[mk]C[Would closing white off with k3 been better?

A: Probably yes. In any case, the direction is wrong - first priority is to prevent the connction between the two White groups, so L5 is a key point. Black's Q6 group is very strong with S4 down there, so L3 will split White into 2 weak groups (F7 and O4).]
;W[jq];B[il];W[im];B[ko]C[A: Now that Black missed K3 and White played K3 himself, L5 is th wrong way to cut. K5 is a must.]
;W[jo]C[A:... because now Black cannot prevent the linkage, and White is very much reliefed on both groups.]
;B[kn];W[jp];B[ho]C[Even with this white is able to catch two stones, meaning that this move was useless.

A: Yes];W[nk]C[A: Now starts a sequence where both players miss the most important points, which are R3, O18, B2/b3. The next moves are all dame...]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[ml];W[mj];B[kk]C[Was this play too conservative? I think it allowed white to connect his right group to safety.

A: White is not really under danger anyway - he has plays like S6, S11 and of course running to the center.]

A: What's wrong with H14?]

-Flameinice

A: In my vies, the main lessons you should learn from this game is to attack from the weak side. Several times in this games such errors in direction were very severe.]
