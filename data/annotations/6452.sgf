C[Hello,
thanks to review my game.

My name is houbs and I am a beginer
go player.

It is a game I won, but I am sure you can tell me many interesting thing to improve my game.

I play with black, I like you to tell me: - how is my fuseki (I am not used to play even game)
- what was wrong with my game
- how can I be more agressive
- where are big mistakes
- where could I have played much more better

Moreover, in the SGF, I'll put few questions I like you to answear in comments.

Thanks a lot.

Hi, my name is Tom, and I'll be reviewing your game.  Mostly you played pretty well, the biggest problem I think is playing  too many small moves in the midgame.  Every move, ask yourself: how many points will I get if I play here?  How many points will my opponent get for playing here?  Is it sente?  But overall I think you played a good game.]

(;B[qi]C[QUESTION : better at P4 ?

Yes P4 is better.  If you want to pincer, R12 or Q11 tend to be a little better.  The difference is pretty small though.  I show some variations.]

C[QUESTION : big mistake ! Better at R19 ?

R19 is fine, although many players prefer Q19, because with R19, White has S19 in sente later in the game.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pa]C[Mistake for white.  Just capture.];B[oa]
;W[qa];B[qb];W[rc];B[pb]TR[cj][ep][op]C[Not needed.  White can't cut.  Now would be a perfect time to play P4, E4, or C10.]
;W[sb];B[ep]C[QUESTION : better at P4 or D10 ?

This is fine.  P4 looks a little better because it works with the black wall at Q11, but it's not a huge difference I don't think.]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cm];B[jq];W[lq]C[This white move is too loose.  Black can still invade, and reach out towards the stones on the right side.]
;B[cj];W[el];B[ej]C[Good move, builds territory along the left side.]
;W[gl];B[gj];W[hm];B[jo];W[jm]
(;B[lo]C[I think black can afford to be a little more aggressive here.  I added a variation at P4.]
;W[mp];B[lm];W[kl];B[ml]TR[gc][ij][pn]C[Accomplishes little.  Consider G17, J10, or Q6.]

(;B[lf]C[QUESTION : better N17 ?

No.  M15 or O12 are possibilities.];W[mg]

(;B[ll]C[Not needed.];W[oo];B[om];W[ln];B[kn];W[mn];B[km]C[Also not needed.  The stones on both sides are alive.]
;W[ho];B[hq];W[en];B[jl]TR[cc][sf][ig][bl][ro][fr][kr]C[Too small.  Maybe 1 or 2 points.  C17 is still wide open for invasion.  If you J13 or somewhere similar is also large.  T14 is probably 7 or 8 points.  S5 is bigger, about 5 or 6 points.  B8 is bigger, also about 6 points.  F2 is bigger, and L2 is bigger.

Capturing a single stone is almost always too small for this stage in the game.]
;W[il];B[kk];W[jk];B[kl]C[Way too small.  Filling in a 1 point ko should be your last move at the very end of the game.]
;W[kj];B[li]C[zero points.];W[mh];B[lh]C[Zero points.];W[lg]
;B[ki]C[Zero points.  In fact, you're pushing white into your territory, so maybe this is negative points.]
;W[jh];B[hh]C[Good.  This is the move you should have played 10 moves ago!]
;W[ii];B[ih]C[J13 may be a little better.];W[ig];B[hg];W[sa]
;B[qa]C[Too small.  This move is 2 points in gote.  J14 is much larger, maybe 10 points.]
;W[ke]

(;B[lb]C[Again, better to cut at L17 and kill the black stones.]

(;B[ic]C[QUESTION : Then I will crowl on the top ... my big moyo is vanihing ! How should I have played to keep it ?

In general, when you have a group completely surrounded like this, you should try to kill them by leaving no space for eyes.  I like G16 or E13.  I show a few variations.  It will be tricky, but you can probably kill them.]
;W[hc]
(;B[hb]C[Attaching underneath is weak.  Peep at G16, then follow with G17.]
;W[gc];B[gb]C[Still bad.  Play E17 to salvage the top left corner.]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[fb];B[fa]C[Very small move.  1 point or less, and in the middle of a life or death battle!  E17 keeps the pressure on white.]

[fr:A][kr:B]C[Ok, it's the endgame now.  Here are big plays you should always look for:

2nd line descents: A, B, and C.  This moves give you more points, and are almost always sente because they threaten a monkey jump (see next).  Note C is actually gote, but it's still a good move because it blocks White. The point value varies, but it's genverall about 6 points.

Monkey Jumps: D and E.  These are very big, about 8 points, less if there are more white stones blocking.]
;B[aj]C[Zero points.  You can kill that stone whenever you want.]
