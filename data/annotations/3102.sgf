C[Dear Reviewer,

This is a game that I played online with one of my friend. I think it is an enjoyable game because both of us spend a long time thinking about each move.

I played white and at the end I lost by 4 points.

I am especially interested in two things in the game:

1) Why does my stones in the lower left turn out so weak? How could I improve my situation?

2) Is it correct to "kakari" the right corner before answering black's kakari on my lower left?

I am interested to join IGS and we would like to know what "rank" to set for ourselves. Based on this game, could you give some suggestions?

Thank you!

Sam Hui





Original review by DR (whoever that may be)
Review reviewed by JL (Jarkko Lindblad, IGS 1d*)];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[fq]C[I believe that Black should defend his right corner by Q5 or R5 before he "kakari". (I think I got this information from some go books).

DR: many moves are possible in this situation. For example: R9 or Q9 is the famous chinese opening (low or high respectivly), which aims at creating a large moyo for black. The two moves you recomend are good if you like to have some secure territory from the begining. The move played is also good and is a move I would play myself. C10 or D10 are also possible, if you don;t like white to make a san-ren-sei formation. In general opening is a matter of taste.]
;W[po]LB[cn:A][jp:B]C[So I go for Q5 first before defending left corner. Is this correct play?

DR: your play is ok, if you like it :-)  This move means that you don't like to be submissive and answer the moves of your opponent: "he attacks my corner, I will attack his. He goes his way, I will go my way".

JL: Also by playing this way white can try to probe black's answer here and then select the line of play for the lower left. I often play like this as if instead white played 'A', black would play something like 'B' which is too good for black IMHO.]
;B[oo]
(;W[pp]C[I do not know the "Joseki" for this so I just try something.

DR: There are many josekis. The choice of joseki depends on the situation. The one you chose seems like is going to work for your oponent more than it works for you. It will give black a wall facing left and for white some territory at the right side. Black has already the F3 stone and having a wall at the bottom right facing it, is just perfect for him. At the same time, white's prospects on the right side are reduced by the presense of the Q16 stone. So maybe your choise of joseki is not the best.
See the variation for an alternative.
It must also be said that black's choise of attaching from the outside with P5 was wise for the same reason's as above.

JL: I am not sure this move is a joseki move - usually it is bad style to butt one's head against a stone like white is doing now - after black blocks, white only has 3 liberties. Also, the F3-stone is in nice position as black will get a good wall into that direction.]
;B[op];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr]LB[pn:A]C[DR: this move gives the chance to black to play "A" and confine white to the corner. See the variation on the next move. And it gives white very little (it is small). Avoid such moves in the opening! You should play "A" yourself instead.

JL: Indeed. Especially since black has the Q16-stone, a black stone at 'A' now would make the game difficult for white. Still even if white had played 'A' now instead or R2, black R2 would be extremely big and also sente which indicates that the original 'head butting' move of Q4 was bad (and not a joseki move).]

(;B[cn]LB[pn:A][eo:C][fo:B]C[DR: Except "A", "B" or "C" building a big moyo is a better use of the P3 wall for Black.

JL: 'A' is definately the only move here. It punishes white for his error. 'C' gives white too much solid territory. 'B' is ok, but not as important as 'A'. Urgernt moves first, big ones later.]
;W[eo];B[cq]
(;W[dq]LB[dj:A][jp:B][pn:C]C[DR: The C3 move gave white the chance to reduce a little the power of the P3 wall but this is not the correct way. White should block from the other side. See the variation.

JL: As white has no stones nearby 'A' or 'B', there is really little point in playing another move here - tenuki of 'C' is the only move now. These two white stones should be treated lightly - there is no way white can make significant territory here. The way white plays here is a heavy way of playing.]
;B[cp]
(;W[gp]LB[pn:A]C[Is G4 the right move?

DR: Hard to say. It wants to keep black low. Ithink playing  a forcing move at E7 first and then attack the lone stone with H3 might be better. See variation.

JL: this reduces black wall in the right while being loosely connected to the other white stones so it can't be bad. The important thing now is to take sente as 'A' is the most urgent point on board.]

(;B[gq]LB[hq:A]C[DR: As Black I would play J4. This uses the P3 wall well. See variation. Then he will use the F3 stone sacrifising it to the best way.

JL: the usual light jump of 'A' is better than the move played and the move suggested by DR. One should always strive to "jump ahead".]
;W[hp];B[hq]MA[oo][op][oq][pq]C[So I just play somewhere else. I believe C10 is a big point.

DR: Yes, but J4 is very important as I said before. And it is sente. So, you will get the chance to play at a big point later.

JL: Locally J4 was the point. C10 is a bad move now anyhow - as the marked stone is 'low', the size of this side is reduced compared to the top side. Also if one insists on playing here, one should probably play 'A' because of 'B', although white can now try to confine black in starting with 'F'. The right combination however in this position is however white 'C', black 'D', white 'E'. Very messy board - I guess I'll iuse variations the next time :)]
;W[cj]LB[cl:A][bo:B][ip:C][jq:D][pn:E][dm:F]C[So I just play somewhere else. I believe C10 is a big point.

;B[ip]MA[qr]C[Again, I do not know how to answer this "hane". I think I should answer J5 but I am afraid that Black would gain more and more territory in the middle and start to move to the center.

DR: J4 was very importand for both. Black gains more and more territory in the middle and start to move to the center, just because you let him do so!

JL: still, black should not have been so preoccupied with territory here in the first place as white has the marked stone ready for a 'monkey jump'.]

(;W[dm]MA[cj]LB[kp:A][pn:B]C[I play D7 because of 2 reasons:

1) I learn from somewhere that both D7 adn G4 are important points in this situation.

2) I try to link the lower group with the stone in C10 in case it went under attack.

DR: OK. But play J5 first. Because of Black J4 the lower white group is already weak and can come under attack. So E7 instead of D7 is better shape for it. Imagine the sequence: Black D6-W E6-B E7 at some point later.

JL: this is an interesting position. There are many ways of playing for white. White realized that this group needs strenghtening urgently. I agree with DR that J5 should be played first, also probably K5. This assuming white will continue wth D7 after that. This way white would be consistent with his strategy. However white might not want to play J5 as it makes black stronger and removes some later options ('A') . Also since 'B' is so important and big (actually white might want to play one line above it), getting sente would also be nice.]
;B[fp]C[JL: moves like this are small and aji-keshi];W[fo]MA[gp]
[hp]C[I think the situation would be very bad for me if Black cut me at G5. Luckily he did not.

DR: the cut he chose is much more severe for white :-)

JL: the two marked stones are something white should give up without thinking unless he thinks he can attack the black stones below them.]
;B[dn];W[fm]C[JL: proper shape];B[en];W[fn];B[em]
(;W[dl]MA[cj]LB[ek:A]C[DR: This is bad. Leting Black E8 is unbearable. E8 was the only move.

JL: no it's not the only move :) White's move is big mistake still - no point in trying to save all the stones. White can either block or play at 'A' which seems to leave less aji as it works better with the marked stone.]
;B[el]
(;W[dk]C[DR: Also bad. This move does not help white in any way. It gives no territory (the are under it is open and black has the C6 stone), it builds no power, it does nothing for the weak white group at F7. In other words D9 is a useless move.

Making some shape with H6 would be heplfull for the weak white group.

JL: DR is absolutely right here.];B[fl]LB[hn:A]C[JL: and now white is happy to pay 'A' - so black's move really must be bad. Instead the local move is 'a' taking away the eyeshape.]
;W[hn]MA[fl]C[DR: Good. But now this group will come under severe attack.

JL: how? It should be very easy for white to settle the shape now after black's mistake (marked stone).]
;B[ho];W[go];B[io];W[hm]LB[hl:A]C[JL: a bit slow - 'A' is faster and much better. One of the best proverbs says that ikken-tobi is never bad. It is proven right again.]
;B[gl]C[JL: If the previous white move had hit the right spot, white would simply now make an eye.]
;W[jm]MA[oo][op][oq][pq]LB[jl:A]C[I am kind of worried about this group now. I try to escape to the center

DR: Better late than never :-) Now this group is "heavy". It has grown up very big to afford to lose it, it has no eye shape, it will be a trouble for white saving it and a source of joy and profit for black attacking it.

JL: To me 'A' looks better as it leads to better shape, is slightly faster and goes more to the center instead of towards the marked stones.]
;B[gm];W[gn];B[pn]C[JL: good timing.];W[qn];B[pm]LB[qm:A]C[DR: Black missed the double hane tesuji  at "A" :-)

JL: indeed.];W[jc]LB[qm:A][ik:B][kl:C]C[I don't know what is the best thing to do right now so I just take another major point.

DR: Hey! the D3 group is in trouble! how about helping it? Also Black R7is very big and disastrous for White.
There is a go proverb: "Play urgent moves before big moves!". J9 is an urget move. R7 is a big move too (i think bigger than K17, but J9 comes first, according to proverb).

JL: totally wrong direction of play as DR says.First white should play 'A' as black move there would be unbearable. If black answers, then 'B'. However, if black plays 'B' himself, white kosumi of 'C' looks good. Black definately has the initiative here.]
;B[qm];W[rn]
(;B[jk]C[DR: see variation.];W[ik]C[Since I think Black's K9 is an attempt to enclose and kill my group. I touch his stone hoping that my group would be strength in the process and maybe get two eyes.

DR: Good!];B[ij];W[hk]C[I want to make his two stones being disconnected from his main group.

DR: Black failed to attack this group properly and let it escape too easily. See variations for examples of attack.

One importand thing to know about attack is: When attacking you goal is not killing the attacked group but make profit for yourself. This profit can be either territory or power which can be used for attacking something else. If you manage killing in the process, good for you, but don't try too hard to kill

JL: Also, if you don't see a god way of attacing, don't attack - yet, but be patient and attack when the time is right.]
;B[jj];W[hj]C[I hope to connect my stones to the left side group at F10 afterwards.]
;B[rm];W[rp]
(;B[fj]MA[dm][dl][dk][cj]C[DR: Black's attack is not correct. F10 does not give him anything! H11, forcing white to escape, but get nothing in the process of escaping, was better. See variation.

JL: Black does gain a little as now the marked stones are beginning to look really weak. But the variation is cool as well.]
;W[nc]MA[jk][jj][ij]LB[hh:A]C[I don't know what to do with my weak group, and I am afriad that if I play H11 or something like that , then black would play N17 and the whole upper right would belong to black

JL: how about 'A' - it would give more safety to the dragon and make te marked stones weaker in their heaviness :)]
;B[gi];W[qf]C[DR: taking care of the endangered group with H11 was urgent. Nothing else can be as important as that now.

JL: the white dragon is beginning to look dead. or at least it will have awfully hard time to live.]

(;B[oe]C[DR: black is nice to you. H11 shutting the white group in was very severe. See variation.

JL: DR is right, black block of H11 is absolute sente (assuming white can find a way to live).]

;B[qd];W[pc];B[qh]LB[me:A][hi:B]C[JL: too timid. Ikken-tobi of 'A' locally better. Still the block 'B' is of course the only move.]

DR: You are only creating more weak groups! Now Q13 is another weak group. On the variations I give examples of possible attacks.]

DR: good thinking. By the way, black L11 instead of J13 was better.

JL: Really? Black's main target now (this may change in the future) are the marked white stones.

C[building a wall of his own facing upwards. the fact that white has a stone at the upper left increases the effect of this wall. Instead of D10 a play at the urgent point "A" might be better. Later "B" is a big point for both sides (junction point of the two moyos).

JL: there are problems with this. First, black get's to play 'A' now which is the most important point on the board. Second, black makes awfully lot of solid territory early in the game without being over-concentrated while white gets rather thin outside shape. Also even though usually junction point of moyo's is important, that's not really the case here as black's bottom is not really a moyo, but more like solid territory - also since the right side is open from bottom, one should not try to make territory there too seriously yet. Also White moyo is anything but solid. Not only black can reuce it from above, he might even be able to attack the white wall!!! Also notice later black reducing moves like 'C'.]
