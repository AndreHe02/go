C[Hello, I'm 11-kyu KGS and 14-kyu IGS. In this game I was black with 0,5 komi for white. Altough I won the game, now I see that I could and should have lost many times.

I'm mostly interested in comments on fightning and running with groups, as I see this as my biggest weakness, altough any other comments are greatly appreciated too. I added some questions and thoughts through the game.

Thanks in advance for the review.

dc: Hi I am dancor on KGS/IGS.  I'll mark my comments with dc.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[jc];B[qo]C[I'm very comfortable with these two shimari.]
;W[qi];B[fq];W[hq];B[jq];W[ip]C[Q: Is w12 mistake? Where should she play?

dc: wJ4 is bad shape in that bK3 becomes well-placed against wH3 and wJ4 to hinder the formation of eyes.  A simpler option might be wH5.]
;B[jp];W[in];B[fo];W[cm];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er]
;B[cr];W[eq];B[bn];W[cn];B[bo];W[bm];B[fm];W[fr];B[cf]C[Q: Is it urgent to run away with F5 even farther?

dc: Yes.  Starting a second weak group from bC14 is not a good idea, especially when it is close enough that White can easily find a "splitting attack" move the puts pressure on both weak groups.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fc]C[Q: I feel w34 is inconsistent with w32, am I right?

dc: wD16 and wF17 are joseki for the corner, so they are consistent.  However wF17 might be better at G17, because between wF17 and wK17 the spot H17 is left as a possible invasion point for Black.]
;B[eh]C[dc: Kogo's joseki dictionary gives bD11 as the next move, instead of bE12.  The local shape of bC14, bE14, and bE12 with wC12 leaves wD13 as a disturbing possibility, with White able to push out at D14 or E13.]
;W[fk]C[dc: This is a splitting attack move, pressuring your three weak stones below and also your three weak stones above.]
;B[el]C[Q: Now comes the first running fight. My aim was to strenghten my group while reducing whites territory and then run away on the other side. F9 better? Or something completely different?

dc: You are ahead on territory, having three of the corners.  Since you are already quite ahead, you really have to think about safety -- in a sense the only way to lose is to lose a large group in the middle.  Based on this, you should probably think just about running and living and not about reducing territory first and other things.  The three stones below are already almost trapped!  I would probably prefer bG8 here to focus on running and breaking out more.]
;W[ek];B[dl]
(;W[cj];B[dk];W[dj];B[hl]
(;W[ei]C[dc: White losing a move here is too passive in this game.  See variations.]
;B[ho];W[io];B[hm]C[dc: Forming an eye is good.  bH6 is better shape than bH7 though.  F7,F5,H6,H5 make a good shape called a "table shape".]
;W[jo]C[dc: This is horrible shape, it's an empty triangle.]
;B[ko];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[qg];W[ql];B[cc]C[I like solid territory and hate when my opponent has it, although it looks damaging to my weak outer group.

dc: As I said before, you are ahead on territory so think more about safety in the center -- don't hurt your weak groups!]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb];B[db]
;W[ee];B[ff];W[bf];B[cg]C[I should have probably just sacrifice the stone.

dc: This makes "table shape" which is good.  But so does bG12 which is better for running and safety and growing your presence in the center, which it makes sense to do now that the corners and sides are pretty settled.]
;W[bg];B[hf];W[fe]C[dc: Very slow and bad move, at least G15 is better and makes table shape.  But wG12 is good too to rob Black of table shape and cut in between the two weak Black groups.]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[jl]C[Q: K16 necessary?

dc: No.  White has been so passive and Black has already gotten so much.  Just making sure the two weak Black groups live ends this game by a huge landslide.]
;W[kn];B[lo];W[ln];B[mo];W[jd];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[kf];B[lc]
C[I didn't see my mistake.];W[jg];B[ig]C[Q: What is the best way to solve this?

dc: Losing two stones is irrelevant if you just escape.  bJ14 is the normal way to get the eye without losing anything, but it's dangerous here because your weak group could get closed in.]
;W[ie];B[if];W[he];B[gf];W[jh]
(;B[hj]C[Q: I really didn't know how to connect my groups and this move was a guess. Is there a better way? Now I like just J12.

dc: I agree.  J12 seems less likely to be cut, strangely.  It's always tricky when you have two weak groups that can be simultaneously attacked!  Avoid it, _especially_ when you are ahead on territory.]
;W[hi];B[gi];W[hh];B[gh];W[ih]C[Q: I don't know what I would do if w102 cut me at G10 instead. I was thanking her a lot in my head.]
;B[gj];W[dh];B[eg]C[Q: Just sacrifice two stones and run?

dc: Absolutely -- you are way ahead on territory.];W[hn]C[dc: Making a table shape here earlier would have been better!]
;B[gn];W[hp]C[Q: Another sacrifice here?

dc: Yes, just play safe when ahead.];B[go];W[gl];B[fl]C[I didn't see that she threatens to cut me so didn't look for black G10.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[gm]C[This surprised me, it happens to me a lot :-/]

;B[mj];W[mm]C[Q: Now i played a lot of endgame and not-so-big moves, is it urgent to jump with my big weak group again?

dc: I think it is.  Connect to the safety in the upper right and then play the endgame.  Remember, endgame is the part of the game after all the big groups are settled.  To play well, you must play middlegame in the middlegame.]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[om];W[ol];B[pm];W[pl];B[ir];W[hr];B[kb];W[kc]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[mg];W[li];B[mi]C[Q: Here I was actually arogant enough to think my middle group will live after the cut. I didn't see that after white G13, F12 would be a false eye.]
;W[lj];B[gg]C[I realized it now.];W[dg]C[Thank you!];B[im]C[dc: With the group alive now, the game is over.  My advice is to play safe when you are ahead on territory and take risks only when you are behind enough that you feel you have to.  I definitely also recommend thinking about shape.  You will be stronger in later fights if you make better shapes earlier.  Make table shape, don't make empty triangles or one-space jumps at right angles.  Emphasizing connection is very, very important.  If you have one weak group, deal with it immediately before another one appears.  If you have two weak groups, life for both can be very, very difficult.  This is my last comment.]
