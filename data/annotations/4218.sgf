'A' or 'B' are more common];W[qk];B[po];W[np];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp]

(;W[fq]C[It is more common to finish the sequence in the bottom right  corner.  As it stands, white is much weaker and black is stronger than after the joseki. see variation]
;B[hq]LB[lq:A]C[A good choice.  If white takes the corner (see variation), then black can take the vital point of A]

(;W[jq]LB[lq:A][oq:B]TR[np]C[This move probably not solves whites problem.  A is still open. A is an invasion point for the triangled extension; and it threatens B.]
;B[fp]TR[qk][pq]SQ[po]C[Black gets some value by attackiing the white stone, while white still does not have a stable group on the bottom.  This is not the result one expects after making a chinese extension (triangles), inviting black to make a weak group at square]

(;W[eq]C[It is better for white to connect his groups (variation)]
;B[ep];W[cr];B[gp]C[White lives locally, but that is small at this stage.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[ci]LB[bp:A]C[Black will probably have big sente on the corner now. White should think about playing A (the double keima is a nice shape)]

;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[bq];B[bo];W[oq]LB[or:A][rr:B]C[White should answer in the bottom left corner.  Blacks sente is big.

(;B[ce]LB[df:B][cg:A][ck:D][cl:C]C[Locally, B is probably better for the same idea.
Globally, maybe black can wait and see if he wants instead try A directly (in white case he would have liked C to be a D.  (C was too close to blacks wall remember)]
