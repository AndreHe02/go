C[mlansman: Hey, thanks in advance for the review!

I think I did well in the opening but let myself down in the middle game, which happens a lot.

I've asked lots of questions, feel free to give short answers to those you don't think are important, and please do point out any mistakes I haven't noted.

Gus: Hi, always glad to help, sorry I wasn't faster about it... I'll try to preface my comments with my name. You are correct that you got ahead early on, but a couple of slack moves allowed W to live too easily. W had a strong tendency to overplay.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[dp];W[pc]
(;B[qe]C[mlansman: would Q15 have been better for this fuseki?

Gus: Yes Q15 is a bit more consistent with the high 4-4 stones, but I don't think that this is unplayable.]
;W[nd];B[qh]C[Gus: Again, you started with high 4-4 stones which are about center power and influence and this move is territory oriented. Locally it's fine but it feels slightly at odds with your q4 stone.]

(;W[cn]
(;B[fp]C[Gus: White has failed to finish the joseki up top. Sente is important. It's much easier to take sente with a move at f3.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[Gus: this is too small w should fall behind playing this move this early.]
;B[jq]C[mlansman: was this the right response to B3?

Gus: I think it's ok since w has an unfinished joseki. If the upper side were stable, I'd be inclined to play B2 first and not give up the corner territory.]

(;W[dk]C[Gus: This is a bit odd by W. moving up the left side isn't terribly important since c16 is low, and the white group can alwasy play c2 to live if attacked. W should be using this move to fix the unfinished joseki.]

(;B[hc]C[mlansman: I think invading this side was the correct strategy, but would J17 have been better, threatening to ruin whites eye space in the top right?

Gus: yes generally the right Idea I tend to like the idea of forcing the upper right to be over-concentrated, here I feel like w gets to fix the problemwith l17 if he wants]

(;W[ec]C[Terrible move by W. This helps black attack the unfinished joseki.]
;B[kc];W[mc]C[so now you should be thining about how to attack this tiny w group at the top]

(;B[pm]LB[rc:A][jo:B]TR[qh]C[mlansman: again I think this was the right strategic decision, but is their anything I could have done prevent differently to prevent white's Q10 response

Gus: I don't agree. Because your marked stone is low this seems like a difficult direction to pursue.  I would take the free territory with the slide to A and the build a moyo by taking away the cap at B]
;W[pj]C[Gus: this is an overplay by w. The top right w group is too weak for this. B can play s17 any time to settle.]

(;B[ok]C[mlansman: good defence?

Gus: This is not a situation for defense. One whtie stone against 4 black stones! Attack!! What you do here is touching a weak stone. Even so W is so weak that if you play good attacking moves from here this is not too bad.]

(;W[qj]C[Gus: W way heavy and over concentrated. This move is only slightly better than passing.]

(;B[pq]C[mlansman: should I have just responded to white's heavy move with an attack?

Gus: YES! :)... but if you are going to build the moyo you must take away the cap at k5 first.]
;W[rd]C[Gus: Now your passive move has let W take some initiative and fix his weak group at the top in sente. This is probably worth 30 - 40 points. +10 corner points for w. +10 points for fixed one of two weak groups, Black -5 or 10 points of territory and -10 points for black because now his group is weak. Now Black and W can run into the center together. So B's weak group nullifies W's penalty for the 2 W stones now.]
;B[re]C[mlansman: would it have been better to abandon the side and go for influence while attacking w's R10 group?]
;W[ph];B[pg];W[oh]
(;B[od]C[mlansman: bad move? I was going for a leaning attack

Gus: In this situation you want to settle as quickly as possible so that w is the one with the weak group. This stone you played is not connected, so it's not strong enough to attack this would only work as a sacrifice]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[oe];B[of];W[ne];B[nf]
(;W[mf]C[Gus: the formerly weak W corner is now large and strong and the black group is under attack all because you didn't slide.]

(;B[mg];W[ng];B[lf];W[me];B[lh]C[mlansman: I was unhappy with this gote result, where should I have stopped? Or should I have been happy with it?

Gus: Getting sealed in is a terrible result you are correct. Your only hope is to live before W now and get outside stones while making W live.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[pl];B[ol];W[qi];B[rh];W[ri];B[og]C[Gus: It stinks to have to fill in your own liberties and help w connect/get out like this, but living as fast as posslbe once you are sealed off is probably correct. If you live before W you have a chance still.]
;W[nh];B[qf]C[mlansman: did I handle this well, could I have done it in sente?

Gus: Getting cut off was bad, living in gote was as good as you can get from there.]
;W[mh]
(;B[if]C[mlansman: bad move?

Terrible. if W lives easy now you get no compensation. Even so, w is still suffering from the earlier overplay on the right side. B ccan still win.]

(;W[kq]C[Foolish by W. This is totally silly. W is just throwing in and ignoring the whole board situiation in hopes that you make a mistake and give up something big.  Even if one plays in this area it is NOT by attaching a stone on the 3rd line. Perhaps a shoulder hit  is ok locally but this is just terrible. Now you press this down and make it live small then you have more wall with which to threaten an attack on the W right side group.]

(;B[jp]C[mlansman: was this the right response? Perhaps N4, looking to build centre territory and maybe still kill w? I didn't play N4 because I feared w would push on K3 and escape to the C7 group.

Gus: This is not bad, I think the hane on top would be more severe but I'm not 100% sure about that. N4 seems a bit loose. W owes a move to get out, or make 2 eyes, so anything that harasses l3 from above is probably going to help. Your target]
;W[kp]C[ugh w pushing from behind.];B[jn]C[Gus: Oh no! too loose. Remember the proverb, hit two stones on the head.]

(;B[km]C[Gus: Too loose again. This may be the loosing move]
;W[ms]
(;B[os]C[Gus: p2 slightly better, no ko threats. Your corner doesn't need to make eye shape here.]
;W[js]C[mlansman: white is alive now no? Is their anything I could have done differently?]

(;B[hq]C[Not necessary. This is not about territory. It is about the fight. W cannot make eyes here.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[in]

Second loosing move];W[mp];B[lo];W[lp]
(;B[dg]LB[bd:A]C[mlansman: was this the right strategy or should I have concentrated on the J7 group?

Was D13 the best move for the job?

Gus: This move sits out in the middle of nowhere. I don't really like it. This is a great time to attach at A, and play for variations that extend along the side rather than jump into the corner.]
