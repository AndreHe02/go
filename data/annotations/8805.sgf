C[Hi.

I'm Honza, playing white in this game.
Its from a recent tournament, so a serious game (60mins+byoyomi).
Im EGD 5k, black is EGD 7k.

I really apreciate the effort you put in to review and ill do my best to remember something useful from it! :)
And also im not a native speaker, so forgive me the mistakes here and there :P

(;W[ce]C[is this the right direction?

Az: This is ok. The open corner is big and this uses the power of your wall.]
;B[dh];W[df]C[Az: There are many different joseki choices, I'm not sure there is really any kind of single right and wrong for how you respond here (especially at the kyu level).]
;B[gc];W[bc];B[jc]
(;W[og]LB[qh:A]C[Az: This is the first clear mistake. This does not defend your group very much, and helps black to play a move that removes the aji at A.]
;B[qg]C[I was hoping this exchange was enough to secure the group for now

Az: Sorry to dash your hopes, but this did very little to secure you and made black much stronger.]

(;W[lp]LB[cl:A]C[Is this too sheepish? :/

Az: Its very big, but has less effect on the rest of the board than a move at A would, so I think its a mistake.]
;B[fo];W[pl]LB[cl:A]C[i thought i will build the wall here first then reduce what b does on the left

Az: The value of A is smaller now since it is much harder to seperate black. This seems like a good plan.]
;B[ql];W[pn];B[io]LB[jq:A]C[but b went ahead and palyed there first xD
and A looked dangerous..

Az: This is still ok for white. The weakness at A is real.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[pm];B[rn];W[ip];B[jn]C[Az: I don't like this for black, he should just extend.]
(;W[ho]LB[og:A]C[Az: What is white doing??? You are just making black stronger and making it harder to keep his influence in check. This is the worst / 2nd worst mistake of the game possibly after A.]
;B[hn];W[go];B[gn];W[ik]LB[im:A]TR[go][ho]C[this is probably a too crude a plan..? I was thinking i can escape well if i have A there
i guess reducing would work better without the triangles actually, now when i look at the game..

Az: Much better, white is stabbing himself in the eye with a rusty spoon with those moves.]
;B[ii];W[im];B[in]
(;W[fm]C[and sicne im not enclosed yet, i wanted to go a little deeper
Am i overdoing things again?

Az: You are definitly over doing things and not looking at the whole board. Black has very little on the left side, only the left center, so its not so big.]
;B[fp]C[Could have thought about it a second longer though]
;W[gq];B[kl]C[Az: This should have been whites move, you can do other stuff later. Now the situation is less pleasant for white.]

This when i look at it now seems too weird.

;B[lg]
(;W[lf];B[mf];W[mg]C[Now i cross-cut hoping it will turn out good

Az: Ummm, glad you're an optimist, but thats not a good basis for planning your game. White is not alive up top, so he must respect that fact and be a bit thoughtful.]
;B[kf]C[but it doesnt look so, so i chickened out];W[mh];B[jg]
LB[kg:A]C[Az: Well, if you're going to go for a dead loss go all the way I guess. This is a big setback for what in what should be a sure-win game. White got nothing of value from that exchange at all. Compare this to just jumping to A directly.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[gd];B[fd];W[fe];B[fc];W[ge]C[Az: Good technique, despite the bad moves there white preserves his lead.]
;B[ll]
(;W[lk];B[ml];W[cr]LB[jf:E][of:A][fm:D][ho:C][lp:B]C[Here is how far i remembered the game.

since im not doing very well point-wise, i had to get a lot of points in the endgame
I came out of the endgame a lot better though, took the large points, won a 6 point ko in 1 point endgame, and in the end i even won by 10,5 :P

But even though i won, i felt like there must have been a lot of weird moves from my side.
I just didnt have a good feeling playing the game :(

Thanks a lot for the review!

Honza

Az: Actually you didn't play nearly as badly as you thought you did (and I'm tactless so I'd say if you play horribly). These were the big mistakes I saw, though B wasn't nearly as big as the others. You seem to have issues with the reducing and got greedy several times. Before reducing you should always count (a good idea in general), and use that to help guide your decision. Remember, when you reduce you usually build up your own area at the same time, which makes it doubly effective; if you'd played the 1 jump with E you could have gotten a larger center territory there AND it would be safer. Overall you played very well for a 5 kyu.]

(;W[cr]C[Az: You don't need to answer that move.]))
(;W[kg]C[Az: Right shape.]))
(;W[kg]C[Is this maybe more possible?

Az: This is much more sane. This expands your own territory while reducing black. This is much better.]
))
(;W[cl]C[Az: Better]))
(;W[ll]C[Should i just go out and avoid trouble?]))
(;W[cl];B[dl];W[cm];B[dn];W[ph];B[qh];W[pj];B[qj];W[jk]C[Az: The black territory in the center is small, there is nothing to worry about.]
))
(;W[cl]LB[dl:A][dm:B]C[now i wanted to play here really badly. But then i though it was too small..
How is it really?

Az: This is the biggest move in my opinion. If you turn at A next the lower left corner is in dire straight, and even if black answers you can still cut later at B]
)
(;W[pl];B[ql];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[qm];W[fo]TR[ch][dh]C[Az: If you are going to enclose the bottom you can think about playing this way, however its more urgent to extend on the left.]
