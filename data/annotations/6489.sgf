C[This was one of my most interesting games recently.
Though I lost, I felt like I learned so much from this game.
Please comment on joseki and which move was the
largest if you don't mind.
Andrew];B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dq];B[fq]C[Strange direction];W[co]
;B[iq];W[nq];B[pn]LB[oq:A][or:B]C[Usually Black plays at A or B]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq]C[The result is comfortable for W];B[fc];W[id]
;B[df];W[fd];B[cc]C[Nowadays this plan is popular];W[ec]LB[cd:A]
C[The most simple answer. It's more active for W to block at A]
;B[cd]C[Locally the result is slightly better for B];W[gc]LB[oc:A]
C[Quite slow. Kakari around A would be faster]
(;B[de]LB[nc:A][ci:B]C[Is it necessary to defend here? I would prefer to make the shimari around A.
Also, if Black wants to defend - he must play at B, taking more points -]
;W[od]C[Correct];B[oc];W[nc]
(;B[pd]C[Though out of joseki, it felt like this was slightly better.
Do you agree, or is there a reason why this isn't a joseki?

Breakfast: It's not a joseki, because the lower atari is painful -]

(;W[nd]C[Not the best answer -];B[ob]C[Honte?

Breakfast: Yes, the only move. 
This result is good for B];W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[pg]LB[nb:A]C[I suggest to push at A and check White's response]
;W[qg];B[pi]C[Do you need a wall here?];W[ph];B[oh];W[qh]
(;B[cl]LB[pj:A]C[Usually B connects at A, but I agree that the wall on the right is useless -]
;W[cj]LB[pj:A]C[Atari at A is very nice];B[ch];W[ci];B[bh]C[Usually B extends at D12]
;W[ei];B[fl]C[I'm relatively inexperienced with oki; was this, and my
following move, reasonable moves?

Breakfast: Good shape here. I like it];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq]
;W[dp];B[gi]C[Too aggressive. If you want to attack - start from D6]
;W[ek]C[W has lot of other good options, because Black's shape is thin]

(;B[ik]C[Also helps W -];W[hl];B[hm]C[Rude];W[gm];B[gl];W[il]
C[Now B is very weak in the center]
(;B[jl]C[Also rude. We call such shape "pushing toothpaste" -]
;W[im];B[hn];W[gn];B[go];W[fn];B[ep];W[eo]C[I realized after the game that this was a horrible trade
because I created a weakness in my group for nothing.

Breakfast: Yes. You have poor shapes now];B[dj];W[di];B[bk]
;W[ii]C[At this point, I was drastically low on time.  The move I
played wasn't great, but I hoped I could get my time back
and then find a sequencethat works. As is obvious, I
didn't. I included a variation that might've worked, please
critique it or show me a better variation if possible.]

;B[ho];W[gd];B[bq]C[At this point, I was drastic.  I didn't think there was a way
to kill it, but once again I was low on time. I read through
several sequences, so I think I'm right ion saying it was
alive.

Breakfast: W is 200% alive here];W[bp];B[dn];W[do];B[cr];W[dr]

like white could have invaded here or at B and then
created at least a ko.

reviewing it! I hope reviewing it helps you :)
