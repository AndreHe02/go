C[L: Hi, I'm lw346 playing black in this game.  I was 16k? KGS at the time of playing, but I believe myself to be more like 18k.  My comments start with "L:".  Thanks for the review!  Any and all comments will be appreciated.

kex: Hi, I am kex, approx 6k KGS now.  I hope you find my comments useful

I think the problem in black's play in this game is leaving lots of weaknesses behind.  The two-stone group on top left was left unattended, when white's unkillable group was unnecessarily walled, and the walls were full of cutting points.

To play better, black needs to take care of own weaknesses, too, and not just attack.  Also, try to think of when to stop attacking a group - at some point continuing an attack just leaves weaknesses and cutting points on your own groups - and this game has a good example of that.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cd];B[ec]LB[ed:A]C[L: This corner looked the most approachable.  I figured I could extend towards Q16 after white defended, securing territory on the top

kex:  This looks OK, and the reasoning is correct.  A is also possible]
;W[ee]C[L: To be honest, I had no idea what to do against such a move - I thought that white intended to use this move to create a larger framework on the left, so I extended back towards Q10 as was my original plan

kex: If you do not want white to play like this, choose A in the previous diagram.  But this is not bad for you, either.]
;B[gd];W[nc]
(;B[ne]C[L: With this, I thought to enclose the white stone in a smaller area, and hope to run it up against my two stones on the left while at the same time strengthening my right side.  Would M17 have been a better move in this situation? (to build a wall up along the right)

kex:  This is the first error.  See variation];W[kc];B[fq]TR[ec]
[gd]C[kex: now you have left a weak group on the board];W[cn]

C[L: I was hoping to give the white group very little space to live, but I was probably being to greedy?

kex: you have no chance of killing the white group, as it can make eyes on in the corner if you enclose it.  But harrassing it in order to make the huge moyo above looks like it could work]

(;W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[mq];W[no];B[oq];W[qp]
(;B[km]C[L: With this move I was trying to limit the spread of the white group towards the bottom left corner.  Would this move have been better around C11?

kex:  hmm.  This move is not so good, there are better alternatives.  I am not sure which would be best, though]

(;B[lg]TR[ll]C[L: I didn't want white to split my groups up here

kex: I wonder which groups you mean.  Since you allowed white to push at triangle, your wall is much weaker.  And there are cutting points.  So you should strengthen the wall soon]

;W[fe]
(;B[ih]C[kex: this is bad.  It does not connect to your moyo, nor cut white.  It pushes white towards your own moyo.  at the moment it would be better to go to the other direction - make damage to white's left side moyo]

(;B[dg]C[kex: there are simply too many cutting points.  I am not sure about the variations, but you simply cannot leave so many cutting points behind.]

(;W[ci];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej]LB[gh:A]C[now this has so far worked as protecting your cutting point at A, but now you are pushing the cart from behind.  White makes secure territory]

;W[fd];B[qq];W[sr];B[pq]C[L: From here on in it just starts to go wrong, with white exploiting all the cutting points along the M9-T9 border, making me lose tens of points in the ensuing fight.  Any suggestions on how to defend better would be much appreciated]

(;B[tt]LB[ob:A][md:E][cg:C][mm:F][rm:D][qr:B]C[kex: there are lots of endgame moves.  You chose F, but I do not think that right now it is even sente, as white can play in the upper corner to get a big profit, and if you then get the two stones, white plays B.

You are right that it is endgame time, but the biggest move is somewhere around A.  Another sente move is E, and D is pretty big, as well as B, which is surprisingly big.  It is not a sente move, but it prevents white from making a big sente move, and thus it is big in itself. 

Something around C is also big, but not a sente move.  Right now your stones are really weak in that area, since there are too many cutting points left for white to use.]
