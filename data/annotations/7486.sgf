C[Hi! This game is from a tournament in Bochum (Germany) last sunday, I started as 11k (white), my opponent was 9k (black).


Hey Erik,
I'm Max, a 6kyu from GÃ¶ttingen, Germany.

I'll prefix all my comments in the main game line with "Max-" and try to address all the questions you added.

I'll also give a summary of the review at the end of the game.]

[dp]C[Max-
This configuration of black stones is known as the Chinese Fuseki. It aims at a moyo strategy.

Approaching the 3-4 stone at A is disadvantageous, so instead white usually limits black's moyo at the top with moves such as B or C.

Alternatively he can place emphasis on the bottom by playing D.]

(;W[pj]TR[pd][pp]C[Max-
This configuration of white stones is known as the San-Ren Sei Fuseki. It also aims at a moyo strategy.

The problem with San-Ren Sei against black's Chinese Fuseki is that he is always one move ahead, which will be a huge advantage in moyo vs moyo strategies.]
;B[jd];W[jp];B[jj]LB[cn:A][fq:B]C[Never saw that in a serious game. But not bad, is it?

Max-
When two moyos border on one another, the side to play on that border first will gain an advantage.

Black grabs the lead by limiting whites moyo and at the same time expanding his own.

Now the question for white is: Where to invade blacks moyo ?]

(;W[cn]C[Max-
This looks ok at first, but...]
(;B[cl]LB[en:A][fp:B]C[Max-
When white chooses to jump out with A his plan usually is to press down on the pincer stone to gain outside influence. In this case this will not work because of the c11 stone.

White could double kakari with B and sacrifice the c6 stone.]

(;W[en]
(;B[fq]C[Max-
This fails to put maximum pressure on white, see variations.]
;W[cq]C[Max-
This invasion is premature, white isnt strong enough on the outside to give black alot of influence at the moment.]
;B[cp]LB[bp:B][dq:A]C[Max-
See variation B for correct line.]
(;W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[bs]C[Not the best result, i gues...

Max-
It really isn't very good for white, the outside group is in alot of trouble now, as it is eyeless and very close to black thickness]
;B[eo];W[dl]C[Max-
Attach for defense. A good move.];B[cf]C[Max-
Black cannot tenuki here, a big mistake.];W[ck];B[cm]LB[dm:A]
[bn:B]C[Max-
White should seperate black at B first.]
(;W[dm];B[bn];W[dn];B[dk]LB[bk:A][gn:B]C[What a mess...

Max-
A well placed cut. This is a crucial moment in the game, white must decide how to handle this very carefully.]

(;W[bk];B[bm];W[dj]C[...and I made it even worse!

Max-
Yes, by playing this way white had made the c9 stones heavy and is harming his d6 stones greatly.

Now he has two very weak groups close to one another, a recipe for disaster!]
;B[ek]TR[dk][eo][dp]C[Max-
The e6 group is almost completely surrounded, this is a horrible result.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[cj]
(;B[hp]C[Max-
Black misses the crucial play. See variation.];W[gn]C[I decided to fight for life. Right decision? Right way I finally got it?

Max-
Yes, jumping out is probably best.];B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[ho]
;B[ip];W[fo];B[gp];W[im];B[jm];W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[fj];W[fl]
;B[ej]LB[eg:A][hk:B]C[Max-
Decision time once again: How to handle the d11 group?

Seeing how strong black is all around and that it is eyeless it is probably best to abandon it for now.

Maybe B to live in sente and invade the top or play elsewhere.]

(;W[eg];B[hj];W[gi];B[gj];W[go];B[hl];W[hm];B[gd];W[ce]C[I thought, this coud be a way to get alive there.

Max-
In some cases this is a tesuji, but the keima between e13 and d11 is too easily cut.]
;B[dh]C[Now I realised, that I would'nt succeed...];W[cc]C[...and changed my mind.]
;B[ei]LB[dd:B][df:A]C[Max-
Blacks tenuki is a severe mistake again.]
(;W[df];B[qf]LB[qd:A][qe:B]TR[pj]C[Max-
When the marked stone is in place to limit blacks extension the usual play here is to kick him!]

(;W[qd]
(;B[mc];W[db];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[cg];B[eh];W[qh]C[Now I was quite satisfied again.]
;B[pb]LB[qb:A][pf:B]C[Max-
The corner is gone now, don't worry about it! White should connect at B and incapacitate the r14 stone!]

(;W[qb];B[dg];W[bf];B[ef];W[ob];B[nb]C[That was all weird, was it?

Max-
lol];W[pa];B[pg];W[of];B[oh]LB[me:A][nj:B]C[Max-
Attack from the side that gains most !]
(;W[me];B[lp];W[nq];B[qn];W[ql];B[on]LB[qp:A][rp:B]
(;W[qp];B[rf]LB[re:A][rh:B]C[Max-
The r12 group is weaker, it must be defended first !]
(;W[re];B[rj]LB[ri:A][rl:B]C[Max-
No way to catch the s10 stone, but white can use it to connect !]

(;W[ri];B[rl];W[qj];B[qm];W[ph];B[og];W[rk];B[pl];W[qk];B[nl]
;W[lr]C[Any chance to connect?

Max-
No, but this move still destroys alot of blacks territory.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[jr];W[jq];B[ir];W[lc];B[ld];W[kc]C[ok, I had no exact plan... Maybe some cutting at the right or connecting to the left.

Max-
Lets see what happens : )];B[md];W[nd];B[kd];W[mg]C[Now I intended to spoil his mojo in the middle and maybe catch the stones to the right.

Max-
Yes, putting pressure on the q13 group is a good idea.];B[kg]
;W[mh];B[nj];W[oi];B[nf];W[mf]C[succeeded! :)

Max-
Good job! : )];B[oe];W[ne];B[lk];W[mp];B[lo]LB[ha:F][nc:A][ee:D]
[bh:B][ro:G][lq:C][er:E]C[Max-
We are now entering the endgame phase. So we should be looking for double-sente moves first, then sente, then reverse-sente and finally gote.

Double-Sente:
A

Sente:
B, C, D

Reverse-Sente (moves that are gote for you but would be sente for your opponent):
E

Large Gote:
F,G]
(;W[ee]C[I doubt, if that was the right direction.

Max-
Dunno, it's okay. You could keep the aji untill you've played on the right side of the moyo.]

;B[er];W[ar];B[el];W[em];B[do];W[fm];B[dd]C[Max-
Maybe sacrificing the two stones is better than losing the monkey jump.]

LB[ha:B][fb:A]C[Max-
The monkey jump doesnt work anymore because of the c16 stone, so A is correct.]

(;W[fb];B[gb];W[hc]C[I'm sorry. Meanwhile, I were under pressure by byojomi.

Ah, I know the problem : )];B[gc];W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[sn];W[sp]
;B[np]C[That was the beginning of a fateful Ko. I didn't count yet properly, but my feeling was, that it was close (and the KGS-"guess-the-result" sais the same).]

C[Immediatly after he played this stone, we both believed, that it were'nt a ko-threat.

Max-
And you were both right.];W[np]C[So i covered. And he thought again about it...]
;B[bb]C[...and caused the final trouble :(];W[ba];B[ca]LB[da:B]
[ac:A]C[Max-
White should just take at B.]
(;W[ac];B[aa];W[af];B[da]C[So he won by about 20 points.

Max-

All in all I think you played fine, that one silly mistake is all that kept you from winning the game after all.

I think you should definetly work on your fuseki and your openings. Knowing such common fuseki strategies as the chinese, the kobayashi and san-ren sei and how to counter them is a must.

In the middle game I think you should more often consider which groups are important and why. You basically weighed yourself down pretty early in the game by creating two very weak groups which ended in a big capture by your opponent [and could have turned out worse if he hadnt tenuki'd every chance he got ; ) \]

I guess the main reason you didn't find the correct answer to the c19 throw in was the byo-yomi. The only thing that can help with that is doing lots of tsumego.

Anyways, I hope you enjoyed this review and will take one or two ideas from it. If you have any questions don't hesitate to write back!

All the best,
Max])
