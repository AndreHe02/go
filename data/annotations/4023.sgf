C[I am black in this game. I am specifically looking for help on how I should have answered one specific move that occurred in this game...Move number 70.

Please go to that move for more information.

Thanks for reviewing!

Llywelyn: Interesting game, I hope you find my review useful.

There are a few big points for you to work on.

1.  Shape.  Don't make empty triangles unless it is absolutely the right move.  Don't play in such a way that a one-point jump or knight's move is already split.

2. Safety Plays.  A lot of your plays here I really wonder what you worried about.  If you can't read about anything bad happening, there's no reason to fill in your own aji.  Don't worry about what your opponent might be able to read out--work on reading it out yourself. 

3. The 4th line is for development, the 3rd line is for territory.  Play a little of a mix of both in the opening.

Hope you find the reivew helpful, and let me know if you have any questions :)]

;W[dp];B[dd];W[pd];B[dj]TR[cn]C[Llywelyn:  I think I would have prefered an approacch here, as this seems at cross-purpose with your diagonal opening.  You started a diagonal opening with D16, thus you should be prepared for getting right in to getting your hands dirty.

If you wanted to more peaceful game or wanted to play a more framework-oriented strategy, Q16 would have been consistent.]
;W[fc]
(;B[df]TR[dj][dd]LB[cf:B][hc:A]C[Llywelyn: I don't like how all three of  your stones on this side are on the 4th line, at least not with a white stone sitting there waiting for you at D4.  As it stands you are fine, because everything on this line is at the same height, but it will require more defensive moves later if you want to protect your framework.

I would have personally played a pincer at "A" or one lower at "B"]
;W[db];B[cc];W[ic];B[dm]TR[cn][cm][fq][pf]C[Llywelyn: Awkward approach and not as big as it looks.  An approach on Q16 (stopping a double-wing from forming)  or an approach from the other side both seem bigger.

From this side something on the third line is probably best.]
;W[cn]TR[fp]C[Llywelyn: Weird play, F4 is typical.  Note, however, that this necessitates you defending the largish framework on the left-hand side.]

(;B[jp]TR[qg][cm][fq]C[Llywelyn: This move has only one purpose--to build a framework along the bottom.  In this case you need to attack or defend.   This move is going to provoke an approach around R6, and if you aren't careful is going to give W a double-wing.]
;W[qn];B[pl]TR[pk][ql][nq]C[Llywelyn: I don't like this pincer given the board.  Maybe a tight pincer, a two-space high pincer, or a knight's move.]

[cm:D][ch:E][qg:A]C[Llywelyn: Bad shape.  This forms a cut one-point jump, which is worse than an empty triangle.  "A" is probably the move you are looking for, but is still very small.  B and C are both looking in the right direction.

At some point in this exchange D and/or E also is going to become big.]

C[Again...I am black. My reaction (Move 71) to white's move at C12 was what really did me in for this game. My next move, as you will see, was terrible and cost me the entire left side. Instead of defending this area in some way...I basically gave it to my opponent. Can you please give me some scenarios that would have been better...specifically on how I could have defended this area. Should I have played B12 or the shoulder at B11...etc. and if...so how would they have possibly played out?

(Also - If possible - Can you give me you feelngs on my gameplay overall.  I have only been playing a few days (with some study last year) and would love any feedback you can give on how I can improve.

Thanks!

Llywelyn: Your initial reaction was, believe it or not, reasonable.  A little unusual, but not all that bad--particularly if you want influence.

You need to realize that  the left side is not your territory.  It is an open framework.  Don't prematurely think of things as territory before you have secured them as such.

Alright, onward and forward: the A+ answer here was to not get into that circumstance in the first place. 

That said, you made the mistake in assuming that C12 was a weak stone and therefore didn't come into contact with it (though it is good that, you know not to touch weak stones).  C12 is a strong stone that has a clear escape route and support, so it is going to live by escaping to C6, out to W's framework in the north, or on its own under your stones.  With your high framework (all of the stones on the 4th line) there's just no good way to stop it from doing at least one of those.

Your best bet here is to try and maintain the continuity of your stones and build up thickness.]

(;B[eh];W[bj];B[ci];W[bi];B[bk]LB[ig:D][ge:E][bg:B][cb:C][cl:A]
C[Llywelyn: Greedy.  There's no way that crawling along the second line like this is going to help you.

Locally your best choices here are A and B.  A forces W to either find a plan to live locally or to escape in short order.  B kills the eyespace (forcing W to escape) but maintains a small mount of territory for you, it also makes the move a C big for either side.

It should be noted that E and D are not small moves.];W[ck]
;B[bl];W[cl];B[bm]TR[dj][dm]C[Llywelyn: Note that while pushing along the bottom here you are weakening the connection between the marked stones.]

C[Llywelyn: Nice--keeping your stones connected here is a must.]
;W[do];B[dk];W[be];B[dl];W[co];B[dh];W[bd];B[cd]TR[ge][ig]LB[ro:B]
[qr:A]C[Llywelyn: Unnecessary and makes an empty triangle.   Time to go for a big point elsewhere.

Also, notice that with the wall at D8 the group at Q5 is a bit weak.  I'd be tempted to apply pressure on it to see if I could get a reduction on White by forcing that group to either run or make eyes.  I'd probably try B, but A is another point to look at.]

(;B[cb];W[fe];B[ff];W[ge]
(;B[ee]TR[df][cd][dd][cf]LB[ef:A][gg:C][hg:B]C[Llywelyn: Why? What were you worried about?

The marked structure is called a "bamboo joint."  It is not cuttable, so you shouldn't feel the need to defend it.

Similarly, the stone at F14 is in a strong table shape with the stones at D12 and E12, along with D14, so there is no need to protect the cut at A.]
;W[if];B[hh];W[rn]C[Llywelyn: ...and W secures his group.];B[pm]
;W[qr];B[mr]C[Llywelyn: Why? What were you worried about?

This move is like passing and giving your opponent a free move.  You are playing even, no sense giving your opponent handicap stones ;-)]
;W[qs];B[ed]LB[hm:A][kh:E][gg:C][er:B][eb:D]C[Llywelyn: Again, the question is "what are you worried about."

Those stones are already connected. There's nothing that can happen to them.  It also isn't much of a threat to the group at F17.  

A secures the center moyo and makes it a little more territory-ish.

B prevents W from playing there, which is worth a few points.

C  (or G14) keeps W from playing there, which is worth a few points.

D captures one stone in gote, so is small for this stage of the game, if you are going to look for security in gote, this would have been it :)

E is urgent.  It keeps W from sacrificing a stone at M11 to force a large-scale  trade (see variation)).]

(;W[fd]C[Llywelyn: W chooses to respond anyway.  G17 would have been better just from a shape perspective.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[jg];W[jf];B[kh];W[lg];B[lh]C[Llywelyn: small.]
;W[pn];B[ko];W[er];B[fr]LB[lm:A]C[Llywelyn: Ignoring this and going for "A" would probably have been better if you could keep K6 and L7 separated from the corner white group.
