Hello! I will indicate my comments with "HL". I hope they prove useful.

I think you've shown courage and good judgment in proposing such a game, where you actually took quite a beating! You stand to get better advice than if you had sent a game where you were the one manhandling your opponent. My overall impression is that you could improve easily by following those simple advices:

1. Consider the whole board. When you feel you cannot achieve much by playing another stone locally, playing somewhere else is important, especially at the start of the game, when you need to move first on key points.

2. Remember that attacking and putting pressure on an ennemy position is usually done by playing at a distance. This way, you limit his space to live and make points, and you reduce his capacity to make mischief. Playing too close often create complications that you might loose from.

3. Always think about the possible answer to your move. In other words, think of your adversary's possible response, then your follow-up. If you like the possibilities, go for it. If not, find something else to play.

4. To not get fixated on reduction. Think about securing potential and points, while disturbing your opponent's plans.

You will see that I favor a simple, steady approach to the game. This does not mean that playing fast and aggressive is a bad idea: some great players win this way. But I feel you are not of this disposition at the moment and that my prudent advices could be of some use. If at some point, you want to try the complicated, knife-fighting style, never play without trying to read as deep as you can.]

(;B[qp]C[

HL
I am not sure about this cross-cut. It will complicate things and since you are trying to develop your potential toward the upper right, it does not feel right.]
;W[pp];B[qr];W[rq];B[oq]C[

HL
At this point, White should have played somewhere else, or add a stone at S2. He's already safe in the corner, and he should use sente.]

(;W[rp];B[qn];W[qo];B[no]TR[qp]C[Was this "joseki" too bad? I don't know what I should have done here, perhaps a standard joseki? I don't have all the standard josekis memorized, but should I be memorizing joseki sequences and using them without thinking at all?

HL
First comment, concerning this actual position. I do not think it's joseki, because the local result does not seem balanced. White will live with a small corner, but not much else, besides sente. Black has the outside and is in no immediate danger. Overall, good for Black.
But this does not mean that the cut you've played at R4 was a good idea. You could get a similar result with less risks of complications.

HL(2)
Regarding your question about memorizing joseki, I suggest you learn the most common sequences, but that you also study them. By that, I mean looking at other possibilities besides the moves of the joseki, to understand why they work and ultimately, to see in what board situations they become useful. Doing so will not make you vulnerable to players who do not follow josekis.
A proverb in go says that learning josekis will make you two stones weaker! It means that if you learn them by heart, without studying them, you will play without thinking, you will just go through the motion, and that will certainly make you weaker.]
;W[rr];B[jp];W[qi]
(;B[pj]C[

HL
Maybe not the best direction. You are playing as if the centre is most important. At this point, developing your upper right seems simpler and more efficient (variation).]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[qf]
(;B[pf]C[

HL
Your corner is still open, and this play will make complications possible. in general, complications are good for the player who is weak locally, bad for the one who is strong. In this quarter of the board, you are strong: make points, attack, do not create complications that will actually help your adversary live and eventually ruin your position.]
;W[qe];B[pe];W[pd]C[

HL
The local situation has now become difficult to ascertain. You can no longer count on your superior position: whoever fights best in this corner will get the local advantage.
Remember this simple idea: create complications with contact plays and cuts when you are weak locally, or when you need to make things happen because you are way behind in points. Otherwise, it's common wisdom to asphyxiate your ennemy by building around his invading stones.]
;B[pc]TR[qc]C[
HL
I like R17 better — you keep the corner and Q16 is not well off —, but like I said, it's difficult to read.]
;W[rd];B[od];W[qc];B[qb];W[rc];B[pd]TR[fc][dj][fq]C[I was trying to get the outer side, because outer influence is better than small inner territory. Was this correct?

HL
I agree. Since the corner is lost, getting influence is important as compensation. In that perspective, the best thing would be to finish this local play with sente. So my question is: was it necessary to play Q16? I think taking sente to play somewhere on the left side was more urgent.]
;W[pg]LB[og:B][qg:A]TR[fc][fq]C[

HL
You cannot hope to close him in on this side. Since your stones are strong on the top, and light on the lower side, you do not need to respond to this. consider playing somewhere else, where taking the initiative is important.]

(;B[qg]C[

HL
At this point, I am starting to get the impression that the simple thing you could work on to become better fast, is to always consider the direct, possible answers to your move. This stone is dead already, so why play it?]
;W[rg];B[qh];W[ph];B[pi]C[Although after this I lost by outer influence considerably, for nothing.]
;W[ng]TR[fc][cf][fq]C[

HL
This move by White does not build anything. It's a one-sided move to destroy what you could build in the centre. Do not let yourself think that it is important. You should play on the left side.]
;B[mf];W[jc];B[gd];W[fc];B[gb]TR[gc]C[

HL
Why not G17, simply? Creating a position where your adversary can cut directly is sometimes good, but rarely.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[he];B[ic]C[I did this to get the are at the top.]
;W[cg]C[

HL
And so you have the top, with maybe 25 points, but White's top left corner is worth the same. Considering his potential for development on the left, this is not promising for Black. This shows the importance of taking sente on the left.
Basically, there are two reasons to leave sente to your adversary: because you have to secure life, or because you're taking so much profit in gote that it balances loosing the initiative.]

(;B[di]C[

HL
This feels like you want to contain White, but at this point, this is the only clear objective of this move. You also have to think about making points for yourself.
Starting from stone 54, I am suggesting another simple development.]
;W[ie];B[jd];W[ck];B[ge];W[gf];B[df]TR[fp][fq]C[

HL
You're still focusing on destruction only. In your next game, remember to play stones that will limit your adversary and build your own possibilities.]
;W[fe];B[dg]C[Here I was trying to reduce White territory at the left.

HL
See last comment: reducing is not enough, when you are not ahead in points.]
;W[cf];B[ed]
(;W[ec]TR[ee]C[

HL
White is being lazy. He could play on the other side and I do not think Black could do much about it. See the variations I've tried.]
;B[ee];W[fd]TR[fb]C[

HL
This reduction effort actually killed the possibility of reducing from the top side. See previous variation.]

(;B[cn]C[

HL
Again, you're going for reduction without construction. You are pushing White in the direction you have a chance to make points.]
;W[fq]C[

HL
Consider the opposite exchange... (variation on 68)
To me, this is where you lost the game. This might seem early, but consider that you have lost all the corners, that you do not have solid prospects in the centre and that your adversary does not have weak groups. Of course, anything can happen for us kyu players! But this is very, very difficult.]
;B[dl];W[bp]LB[bi:B][eo:A]
(;B[eo];W[bi]C[

HL
This has become a very difficult game for you: White is way ahead in points and he has no weak groups. Because of this last point, finding compensation in the centre will be very difficult for you, but it is the only clear solution to come back in the game.]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[bl]TR[dk]C[

HL
D9 better.];W[bk]TR[jj][hq];B[gq];W[fp]C[

HL
Another example of bad contact play. Now, White can hope to ruin the centre from this corner too.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[fn]TR[hn]C[

HL
Why not a play on the other side, where you stand to make more points?]

;W[lh]C[

HL
It is starting to look like you are going to split the points in the centre. Unfortunately, this is not good enough to come back in the game.]

C[Since my last comment I was playing without knowing what to do. The game seemed already settled for me. I couldn't see anywhere to attack.


HL
I understand the feeling... And like you, I sometimes loose myself in trying things that don't work. In the best of times, I really try to access the situation and consider letting the game go.]

HL
First, there is too much aji left in C9 to be certain about anything. In the best of all situations, the trade is not good because your 10 points on the left side are not worth the 15 points on the lower left corner you've encouraged White to take, in sente for him.

Yes, but still: White keeps sente and in the process of trying to push out, he has taken 15 points on the side. You also have cutting points that could become a problem later on. All in all, this is why I suggest not responding to Q13.]
