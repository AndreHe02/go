C[I'm black in this game.  This is a game I played at a club.  I'm pretty sure I remembered the game correctly.  I know the entire bottom right fight is correct becausewe spent over an hour just on that part ^_^.

Thanks for reviewing!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qo];W[ec];B[jq]
;W[ck];B[fq];W[dn];B[fo];W[pf];B[pj];W[mq];B[mo]C[I wasn't sure how to attack this stone and decided with a cap.

R: Good choice, i think.];W[pl];B[nj];W[lo]
(;B[lp]C[R: This is too agressive. Touching the stones you attack is usually bad. N6 is better, see variation.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[op];B[no]C[R: Good move.];W[oq]
(;B[pp]C[R: Black needs to defend the corner indeed, but the problem with this move is that it forces white to do what he wants to do anyway: moving out.

I think it's better to defend the corner with Q2, because that move has the advantage of undermining white's eye space. See variation for a possible continuation.]

(;B[lr]C[R: This is a good move to keep white from making two eyes there, but the white attack on the corner is painful. I think black should make a ko at Q1 or play at R7 and threaten to cut. See variation.]
;W[qs];B[qq];W[qm];B[rm];W[rp];B[rq];W[rl];B[pn];W[on];B[pm]
C[R: This move costs you a liberty. It should only be played if you intend to cut directy with your next move, which would be dangerous now.]
;W[ql];B[ro];W[sn];B[rs];W[ps]
(;B[np]C[I think I should have just cut at p8 instead.

R: I agree, then white has to make life for his bottom group and you can split R8 and Q14 see variation.]
;W[ol]
(;B[sm]C[and I think I should have just given him life here in exchange for attacking the q14 stone.

R: That's a good idea. If white answers the attack, black may be strong enough to kill the white group. See variation.]
;W[sl];B[rn]C[R: White now links up to his Q14 stone and is safe. It's much more important for black to prevent this than to prevent white from capturing those two stones in sente.]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[ph];W[qh];B[fl]C[This is the first game in which I deliberately went for a large center moyo.

R: Seems like a good strategy to me. However it's important not to get too focussed on your moyo because centre moyos usually look bigger than they are and you have to be careful not to give your opponent too much territory while protecting your moyo.]

;B[cq];W[dq];B[bp]C[I remembered this sequence from a lecture of Ming jiu's.  Came in handy ^_^]
;W[bn];B[br]C[it doesn't seem like white can kill, but I may be wrong.

R: I think you're right, but white can threaten to kill and destroy some territory at the bottom. See variation.]

(;W[cp]C[R: This white move is bad, it should be at E2. Now black can connect the corner to the side.]
;B[dr]C[R: Good];W[ng];B[mh];W[ni];B[mi];W[oi];B[oj]TR[sm][np]
C[We ran out of time here.  I'm not sure who's ahead, but the SE says black is up by a bit.  I think white may still have a change to kill the top right or at least reduce it a bit.

Anyway, thanks for reviewing!

R: The top right is to difficult for me to read out. I think i would play S15 and N18 to strengthen it.

When you attack an enemy group, it's important to keep in mind that killing it is often not possible and not the purpose of the attack. The ideas you have about where the marked stones should have been played are good. I know from experience how difficult it is to put those ideas into practice, it's tempting to go for the kill if you're not sure the enemy can live.]
