;W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[ic];W[qf]C[Maybe a shimari at C5 is better first.  Black's Chinese opening will certainly give him a moyo, so I should have one too, to keep things balanced, no?

PC: No, or rather, not necessarily. Building a competing moyo is a perfectly valid plan, but it's not the only one. You could, for example, build solid territory and aim to reduce the Black moyo later.

I like your idea of playing C5. This mainly aims at building your own position along the bottom, but it also has an effect on the Black moyo. While the moyo is currently confined to the top edge, Black will want to expand it along the left and right sides and into the centre. If you don't make the shimari, Black can build along the left by playing a kakari at or around C5. Once you make the shimari, Black is restricted to playing an extension around D10.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]C[I didn't like this way of play.  I considered W8 at R16 and R17, but those didn't look good either.  Are O16 or O17 reasonable options for White 8?

PC: I think this is OK. You're establishing a strong group on the edge of Black's moyo, which makes it more difficult for him to expand. You also have a decent chance of making territory along the right.]
;W[qi];B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[op]LB[ck:a]C[Black is not finishing joseki -- UR O16 weak and LL c10 area.

PC: Yes. Not finishing the joseki in the top right in order to grab the big point in the bottom left is understandable, but an extension around 'a' (C9) is such a good move for Black that I wonder why he left it out.]
;W[dj]LB[cl:a]C[I'm not sure about this move.  I wanted to have something to support an invasion at e16, and attacking the lower left group seemed the logical choice.  Perhaps I should attack more strongly with c7?

I'm not sure what to do in this position.  Should I respond to p4?  I was afraid black would somehow get sente and complete his ideal framework with e17.  In retrospect, allowing black to extend to m3 seems really bad.  I should probably have pincered, with m3 perhaps, to build up my framework and not be so paranoid about the black framework -- even though it is on a larger scale!

PC: Ignoring P4 is OK - if you answer it Black may get to extend on the left, which is very big. The problem with the move you played is that it's not a very strong attack: Black can easily settle his group by playing at 'a'. You need to play closer, e.g. play 'a' yourself.]
;B[dl]
(;W[ed]C[Would it have been better to play white c14, black e16, white e14?  If black then gets j15 how could I invade at the top right?

PC: Difficult question. If you exchange C14 for Black E16, you could then take sente to answer P4. Even if Black plays J15,  he still has weaknesses in the top right because of not finishing the joseki there.]
;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb]C[Isn't this an overplay because of white c15?

PC: I think Black is OK here - see variation.]
(;W[gc];B[nd]
(;W[ce]LB[be:a][ch:b]C[Is this the tesuji?  I know there's one here somewhere...

PC: You need a stone around 'b' (C12) to make this work. Playing 'a' (B15) instead looks possible - see variation on previous move.]
;B[de]
(;W[bd]C[d16 better, huh?

A little, but it doesn't really get very far - see variation on previous move.]
;B[dd];W[bf];B[cf];W[be];B[bg]LB[cg:a][bh:b]C[I wondererd about White 'b' (B12) here, but Black can handle it. (see variation).]

(;W[cg];B[bh];W[dg];B[fe];W[ee]LB[ec:a][fd:b][cb:c]C[This sequence ends up taking liberties off yourself, leaving the cut at 'a' (E17) and kills off the two cutting stones. A better plan might be to play somnething solid (like 'a' or 'b' (F16), leaving the other White stones as aji.]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh];W[ge];B[ie];W[fh];B[ei];W[fi]
;B[ej]C[Your building a big wall here, but you've sacrificed most of the left side to do it, and with Black J17 and J15 in the way, it's not obvious how you can use your wall to recover your loss on the left. Better just to leave these moves out and answer P4. This is where your position starts to look really difficult.]
;W[pn]C[Would a pincer be better than the keima here?

PC: Yes, given your strong position in the bottom left a pincer looks like a better idea.]
;B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[ro];B[lq]C[
Black:
  left: 35 ish
  top right: 25

White:
  right: 20
  top left: 10 ish
  bottom left: 5
  total: 35

White has problems: Black is way ahead on territory and none of the Black groups are all that weak, so it's difficult to use White's influence to catch up.]

;W[fm]C[I was pretty proud about the great white wall, but I have a sense I'm already behind here.  Should 60 have been at j3 or k3?

PC: That would have made the game closer, but Black could afford to answer at M5 and still be well ahead.]
;B[dn];W[kc]C[Good - you have to start a fight to use that wall.]
;B[ke];W[jd]C[I was happy for this gift.]
(;B[je]C[I'm not sure Black needs to be this generous - see variation on previous move. However, Black is playing sensibly by giving you some territory (but not enough) and avoiding a fight.]

(;W[lb]C[I thought about 78 at m16 but couldn't see it going anywhere.

PC: I think you're right - see variation on previous move.]
;B[mc];W[nn]C[Key point, I believe.  Unfortunately, not sente against black's group, so I couldn't play at the top.

If I hadn't made the 78-79 exchange, could I have expanded my right side moyo at the top in sente?

PC: I doubt it, the Black position is very strong.];B[nh];W[kq]
C[I felt I needed to get something from my thick wall!  Perhaps I should have defended at P11 first, though.

PC: good, still trying to start fights to use your strength. However, Black keeps refusing to co-operate.]
;B[kr]C[I should have cross-cut next with m2.  See variation...

PC: It certainly has more scope for Black to make mistakes.]

(;W[kp]C[In retrospect, the crosscut seems much better. W m2, L4,]
;B[jr];W[lp];B[mq];W[mp];B[np];W[mi]C[I thought this was interesting -- reducing black while building a large territory in the center.  In retrospect, however, W p11, B o11, W o10 or maybe just W o10 first better.  White's wall at left makes the prospect of black territory in the center bleak.

PC: But Black doesn't need to make territory in the centre, he just needs to keep your centre within bounds. Still, it's hard to suggest alternative at this point.]
