C[Hi friends,

I try not to write good/bad/worse/perfect and so on.

Have fun!];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dc];B[qj]C[Two rows of stones, a thin white (only two stones) and a more connected row of three stones on the black right side.
If I were white, I would respect blacks influence and would avoid any close combat on the right side.

Look at possible ideas]
(;W[qp]C[a daring move! this is nearly a leaning attack, and there is no white stone to help you!

GOLDEN RULE: don't play leaning attacks or kosumi in the beginning (unless it is a joseki you learned)]
;B[qq]C[this is the right answer, in close combat you should not let your opponent get easy life in the corner. Block him out!
Black has the advantege, now 5 liberties!]
(;W[pk]C[oops, w wants to abandon his third stone? that is cruel!

in the middle game this kind of shoulder attack may be good, now it is too close again!]

(;B[ql]C[it's a pity, black should react as in the corner
this position looks like: "want to peep here?"];W[qk]C[YES! :)]
;B[rk]C[(you must play here!)
argh, don't cut me through,
but looking at it, I left two cutting points ...]
(;W[qm]C[w should cut!
if you don't like to cut, then build a wall]
(;B[rm]C[very calm, letting w connect his stones];W[pl]C[YES]
;B[rl]C[normal];W[qn]TR[pk][qk][pl][qm][qp]C[only one calm black move, and w has got a better position. 
These 6 stones are weak, but there is space to run away.]
(;B[rn]C[too calm again, black is defending, forgetting to attack]

(;W[ro]LB[pm:A]C[good, but now A is a cutting point.
if you want to avoid this, just play R5];B[pp]C[ok, attacking white!]

(;W[rq]TR[pm][po]C[this leaves two dangerous points, risky, but b can not connect his two groups]
;B[po]C[strike!];W[qo]C[sure]
(;B[pm]C[strike!
this cutting move is ok, but maybe it is difficult to fight with two groups]
;W[pn];B[om];W[on]LB[om:A][po:B]TR[pk][qk][pl]C[what is the aim of cutting with group A?
Black should capture the triangled stones without dying at the bottom.]
;B[nm];W[pj]LB[qj:D][pk:A][pm:B][po:C][qp:E]C[5 groups fighting!
A only 4 liberties, but can flee to the middle
B only 4 liberties, can run away
C 5 liberties, but not too much room. Don't let w play around S2 AND N3
D creepin along the edge, but if b defends now, it is safe]
;B[qi]C[best move, now b has got one safe group
now w must strengthen one of his two groups, I don't know what is the best move]
;W[no]C[good choice]
(;B[oo]LB[pm:A][po:B]C[why play here?
You can expect w connect at O6, that weekens the A group.
P5 does not improve the strength of the B group!
and what makes it even worse: it's bad shape: empty triangle

You should run away as parallel to the edge as possible];W[nn]
C[sure];B[np]C[the only point letting p5 look nice
b has a lot of problems];W[rr]C[ooops,

w lets black escape!
(but good shape in the corner!]
(;B[qr]C[ok, but a bit dangerous
(and an empty triangle)]
(;W[sp]C[don't try to live in gote if you can attack to gain life!]

(;B[mo]C[this is "squeezing the toothpaste"

you can  not seal w in.];W[mn]C[YES];B[lo]LB[pm:A]C[best move. now you sacrificed group A but you get territory]

(;W[mm]C[if you want to capture a fish, use a net. Don't try it with a paddel/oar]

(;B[nl]C[this is a fighting triangle :)
that means: bad shape but the only move to continue the fight.]

(;B[nk]C[may be interesting, yes];W[mj]C[good!];B[nj]C[ok];W[ni]

C[the "seki-triangle" ;)];B[oi];W[mi]C[this is seki-life for both, but don't let any of the surrounding stones be captured.

Black has got a bit more territory, but w has influence on the left side
Black should play on the left side]
(;B[nh]C[too close again];W[mh]C[w likes it];B[ng]C[good!]
(;W[lm]C[coward!
there is no urgent need, because w lives in the corner anyway
empty triangle]
(;B[ip]C[nice move, easier on the third line]
(;W[ir]C[very agressive deep digging]
(;B[jq]C[again a very docile move, but good]
