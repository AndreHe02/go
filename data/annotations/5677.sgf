C[Hi my name is Go Newbie
and I'm newbie in this game. I'm playing as black here

Hello, I'm Gregor. thank you for letting me review your game. I'll try my best.]
;B[dd];W[tt];B[pp]C[The first two was handicap.];W[cp];B[pd]
;W[nc];B[ep];W[eq]
(;B[en]C[Gregor: b9 is unusual. it's to hig and w kan easily take the corner. an usula answer to w8 would beb9 at f3 or d4. look at vairants:]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gp];B[np];W[pn]
(;B[nn]C[Gregor: instead of b15 at o6 I'd prefere an extension at the bottom. the first moves susuallyare placed at the 3rd or 4th line. 06 is too higt at this stage. look:]
;W[qk]
(;B[ne]C[Gregor: b17 at o15 is too higt. you should follow the principle: try to secure the edges, then extend to the sides, form a Basis there and then extend to the center, not earlier. I'll try some variants.]
;W[pb];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[nd]C[Gregor: b21 does not help. the connection beween b17 and b19 cannot be cut anyway. so it would be better to extend to the left instead. look!]
;W[ld];B[le]C[or P17 maybe?];W[kd];B[je];W[cf];B[df];W[dg]

C[I think I should put my stone on E15];W[ce];B[ee];W[dh];B[ei]
;W[qo];B[jo]C[Gregor: b37 is too higt. better play at k3.];W[jq]
C[Gregor now you see teh consequence: w plays the big point at k3 and has mad a lot of terrytory. b in the center cannot beat this.]
;B[ho];W[hp];B[go];W[qf];B[of];W[ok]
(;B[ni]C[Gregor: b45 is too high. IOt may be difficult to invade at the left side, but b should try it, because the w terrytory becomes huge! I'll try some moves:]
;W[dp];B[eo];W[cm]
(;B[iq]C[Gregor: b49 is lost. I'd prefere to go between the white formation on the left side: look:]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[ir]
(;B[hq]C[Gregor: no use to play here. better on teh other side: i'll try:]
;W[gq]C[Can I rebirth
these stones or not?];B[hr];W[gr];B[di]C[Gregor: b57 is too slow the upper side is more important. the next move of w shows it!]
;W[fc]C[Gregor: this move needs an answer. the corner is in great danger. I'll try some variants:]

(;B[mk];W[ed]C[Gregor: I'd rather fight for the corner. Perhaps it is possible to live there. I'll make some gesses:]

(;B[eh];W[el]C[Gregor: I'd rather attack from the other side: look:]

;B[he]C[or maybe I should put my stone onG14?];W[ic];B[hc];W[ib]
;B[hb];W[dc]C[Gregor: better psay b87 at j1. Look:]
(;B[ha];W[ia];B[oc];W[ob];B[qc];W[rc]C[Gregor: I thing b93 at r18 is better. Look:]

(;B[qd];W[qb];B[pc]C[Gregor: b95 at q17 only savers 1 point. And there are bigger points in the game - f.e. q12 or r3.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[pi];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[gi];B[ii];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[hh];B[ig];W[ih]C[Gregor: I'd rahter block the w invasion with b109 at k12. I'll try:]

(;B[jg]C[I think I should put it on K12
Gregor: I think it too :)];W[jh];B[kg]C[Gregor: now h13 becomes very important as a connection for the b stones in the upper left quarter.]
;W[ji];B[ij];W[ck]C[Gregor: B should tra to connect!];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[fk];W[fl]
(;B[ej]C[Gregor: to play b119 at d9 would be better for making eyes, I think. Look:]
;W[hl];B[il];W[fj];B[ek];W[hg]C[Gregor: now the b stones are dead.]

;B[sq];W[sp];B[so];W[rp];B[rn];W[sr];B[rl]C[Gregor: it' not üpossible to live here! Only if w makes heava mistakes.]
;W[rk];B[bd];W[cd]C[This
is it. I don't think I have chance to win.

I resign.

I hope you can comment my play. I know I play really
bad here. I'll play better next time.

Oh and the komi is -0.5 I don't know why, but if
I change the komi I can't save and if I save it'll
error.
So please understand.

Gregor: Let me make some general remarks:
1. I think the game was not too bad - to loose or win is not so important - to enjyo the game - that's the point!
2. try in the beginning to secue the corners, the extend to the sides and then go to the center. Try to get at least two corners. It is very difficult to win with only one corner!
3. in the middle of the game try to stay connected.
4. the komi of 0,5 makes a remis impossible, because the difference is then at least half a point!

Good luck and thank you again for letting me review the game. I hope, my comments were of help to you.]
