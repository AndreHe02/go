C[romp: Hello. you played an interesting game. Overall, I would suggest reducing your cutting points, and waiting to fight until you have strong stones in the area.]

(;B[qn]C[Is it ok to come this way or better on 03 because my stone is already in a pincer ?

romp: o3 is definitely better];W[mp];B[ql]C[romp: this move begs white to take more territory. the corner is still very open, so r3 is a good option.]
;W[oj];B[on]C[romp: although splitting is a good idea, this move is a bit slow. r4 is fine if you want to settle. r3 will still take the corner, but you're groups will be split.]
;W[ro];B[nq]C[Is the fight that begins premature ?
Normally favorable for black or white ?

romp: I don't like this move. white can split you into two very weak groups while staying strong. r12 is simple IMHO.]

;W[ml];B[nk];W[ko]C[I was quite happy with the way the fight turned out at this point. Seems to me both my groups are solid enough for the moment and white center stones does not do much.
Maybe K4 now ? what do you think ?

romp: k4 absolutely];B[io];W[jp];B[jq];W[lq];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr]
;W[mr];B[ip]C[The previous sequence was a mistake but I still had the impression black was ok, even if a part of the advantage has been lost
Main problem seems that now white center stone are strong and connnected.]

;W[hm];B[hl];W[gm];B[il];W[ho];B[hp];W[go];B[ph]C[I decide to change the side of play to put pressure on P10 and R10 which don't seem very secure

romp: good idea, but keep in mind that your group on the right still isn't very strong.]
;W[ni];B[pj]C[It seemd to me this move is weak retropectively. My group is cut and white seems to live easily. Maybe better to keep pressure and avoid white getting a stable base with something like S11 ?

romp: I would play on top at n11. try not to get closed in.]

;B[cl];W[bl];B[bm];W[ck];B[cm];W[dk];B[ej];W[ch];B[dg]C[romp: this is a conflicted move. your center is in trouble, and this doesn't help the situation, nor the one in the corner.]
