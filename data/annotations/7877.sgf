C[Please do not bother reviewing past move 65. I won by luck, but I believe I was losing up until then.
I don't really understand where my opening fell apart... seems like it fell apart everywhere...
Thanks!

I think that F3 or C6 would be nice here. There is a proverb that says approch from the open side. I prefeer F3 because I like to otry to get my apponant to play in my moyo.]
