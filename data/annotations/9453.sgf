C[Thank you for the review! In this game I didn't feel I made any big mistakes, so I am interested in hearing your thoughts on the key moves that lost the game for me. I added some notes on my reasoning for certain moves.

H: I've reviewed the game, doing my best to point out the biggest areas where a different choice would have made the game easier for black.]

(;B[dp]C[I felt compelled to take the last corner instead of continuing in the bottom right, maybe a mistake but I think it turned out OK?

H: At this point black may end up buried, which is bad for black.]

(;B[ho]LB[cq:A][hq:B]C[H: This direction doesn't make many points, and your shape is still weak.  White gets to gain safety with A, and can still attack the B group later.]
;W[cq];B[ck]LB[bo:A]C[H: This move doesn't accomplish much; white can still gut your territory with A]
;W[co];B[cn];W[do];B[eo];W[ep];B[bo];W[cp];B[en];W[gn];B[pi]
C[H: Good plan.  Be careful though--white has lots of options to invade, still, and r7 is thick.]
;W[qj]C[H: This is a thank you move.  Black solidifies and is under no pressure here.]

I'd recommend books covering topics such as direction of play and invasions for further study.]
