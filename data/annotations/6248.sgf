;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]LB[ce:C][de:A][qk:B]C[-- c15/d15 seems more urgent.
  (from basic principle) but Go opening is a matter of style. 
Many pros play low chinese in this position.  Popular choices are A and B.  your move, F3, is sometimes played too.]
;W[po]LB[cn:A][ip:B][hq:C]C[-- generally it's safer for white to answer F3, because black A is severe in my opinion.  

White can answer calmly at A or if white doesn't like black making moyo with k4/j4, white can pincer around B or even C.]

(;B[np]LB[cn:A]C[-- Most certainly, I think black C6 is better now because white didn't answer black.  Double pincer on a star point is very good.  If you leave it, chance like this won't come later. Q3 will live easily without O4.

This is whole board thinking.  Think about your gain on the Lower left (black 2: white 1) which will compensate for your potential loss on the lower right if white can make another move on Q3.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[de]LB[cn:A][dn:B]C[-- again, you can consider c6/d6.]

;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[eq]LB[bp:A][fp:B]C[-- you forgot the normal joseki here.

-- Compared to normal joseki when you jump into the corner after white c8,  black doesn't have f3. So you should make use of f3 in your game.

-- Instead of E3, you can do B4 and the sequence will be sente for black.  F4 also looks possible but it can be complex.]
;W[bp];B[fp]C[This seems a bit heavy, and the space between this group and the one on the right is too wide. What should I have done?

-- it happened earlier. E3 i didn't like.];W[dn];B[dh];W[ci]
LB[jc:A][mc:B]C[--keep your sente to play around k17, n17 please. D15 group is not in real danger so take the last big point while you can.]

(;B[jd]LB[hc:A]C[-- k16 does nothing to white.  i prefer h17, if white comes in between you around m16 he has two groups to worry when you jump out.]
;W[ld];B[kf]C[Should I have played M17 instead?

-- i can't comment on this, it depends on how you judge the territory balance.

(;B[mo];W[ko]
(;B[in]LB[km:B][lm:A]C[-- i would say left side is stronger for black. you push to your wall from the right.

-- it's not easy for white to make two eyes at all.  Invasion like this is why the center strength of the top black group is important.]

;W[km];B[qm]C[It goes downhill from here, desperation setting in. You may skip the rest.
