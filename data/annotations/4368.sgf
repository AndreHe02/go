RE[W+18.50]
TM[900]

C[To the reviewer:
Thank you very much for spending some of your time on my game! My opponent requested two handicap but was nice enough to let me play even (he was not 6k I think). I learned quite a bit from this game just by playing it, but as go is a maze, I'm having trouble taking more than just the experience from it. Could you please point out some spots in my game I could work on? I had many weak groups (in my opinion...maybe I'm wrong) but I have trouble keeping ahead if I take the time to make sure EVERY group is a super strong one. Anyway, I will interject comments here and there. I appreciate your helping me to become a better player!

z -- Hi Koosh, I'm Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go world.  It is my pleasure to review your game.  I hope I can offer something helpful.  My comments are marked with "z --".  Remember, I am also a weak amateur, and only a little stronger than you.  So if some of my comments and variations don't make sense to you, it may be because they are wrong.  Please check them thoroughly yourself, and consult a stronger player if needed.

z -- As far as weak groups, I agree it is hard to find the time to make every group "super strong".  Still, it is usually wise to have no more weak groups than your opponent has.  If all his groups are strong, then he has played slowly as well - and you shouldn't be behind.  On the other hand, if he has played fast and loose, he should have some weaknesses.  

z -- In this game, black took gote a few times (35, 91, 149) for no compensation.  This gave white some free moves, so it stands to reason white would get ahead.  If you're going to take gote, you should get something for it.  In the opening that usually means making a safe group (as white did with 24, for example).]
;B[pc];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[co];W[pe];B[nd];W[ec];B[gc]C[this seems good development for black!

z -- Agreed, any move around here is both an extension and a pincer - an efficient double purpose move.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[hd]
(;B[hc]C[z -- Kogo's joseki dictionary gives black attaching at D17 before playing this.]
;W[id];B[gd];W[ge];B[ic];W[jd]C[here I must ask myself, would it be better to cut F16 since I have support at O16 or just go for third line points like I did?

z -- see next comment.];B[kc]C[I went for points...the game seemed open and I didn't see white's influence as too good since I have D14

z -- I think this is correct.  Staying connected to the top right is good.]
;W[jc]C[z -- Bad style by white.  Don't push in if you can't cut.]
;B[jb];W[kd];B[lc];W[fd]
(;B[nf]C[perhaps this is a bad move? now that I think about it...white does not have a good follow up move around this area to complete his thickness...I should not reach for the center here...the board is still open.

z -- Yes, moving out here does not seem urgent.  White has given black sente - where best to use it?  Because white has made a solid shape around F16, black's two stones C16-D14 are not very strong.  If white gets to play C12 before black extends, black may have a problem.  So black should want to protect against this in some way.  Black could play C11, C10, or D12 now.  Or black could try D17, which might revert back to the joseki.  Or maybe E4, trying to prepare C10. 

z -- Also, if black wants to play in the upper right, he should be more severe.  White has played Q15 for O16, then tenuki.  So, black's followup should attack Q15.  A pincer such as Q12 or R13 would be good, or perhaps R16, taking territory and preventing white from making a base in this area.  However, all of these moves allow white the option of treating Q15 lightly and switching elsewhere - such as C12.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pd]C[I did not want to play the simple R18...I thought this might be interesting.

z -- I think R18 is better.  See var.];W[qd];B[qf];W[pf];B[qg]
;W[qe]
(;B[pi]C[I assured myself that Q11 was better for pressure than R10

z -- true, but what's wrong with Q13?];W[pb]
(;B[nb]C[P18 better probably

z -- definitely.  If black P18, white will probably play R18, and then black can tenuki.  But after this move, white will get to play elsewhere first.  This is a big difference.  On the other hand, if white chooses to ignore black P18, black will get some profit in sente.  But with O18, black takes gote for nothing.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[ob];B[nc];W[oq]
(;B[rb]C[wasted effort...after the game I was looking at P19 as a way to kill instead, but I don't think it's possible. w can escape too, so this is a bad idea.

z -- I agree, this corner cannot be killed.  Therefore this move wastes a ko threat and loses endgame points (black P19 is no longer sente).  Just playing elsewhere is better.]
;W[qb];B[re];W[rd];B[rf];W[ra];B[gq]C[this move looked interesting...maybe it is weak though. I usually choose a far approach over a close one in games F4 as opposed to F3

z -- I still think E4 is the best move in this area.  Also, a move to help the top left may be needed per previous comments.  

z -- In addition, white's shimari in the lower right makes the right side important, so I think R8 is also good.  If white gets to play R9, your group at R13 could become weak.  G3 is questionable, since white has a strong position in the lower right.  This means that G3 could end up weak after white moves through the gap.]
;W[do];B[dp]C[I had the ladder, so I thought I'd try to make O14 useful.

z -- Interesting idea, let's see how it turns out.

z -- Kogo's gives only D6.];W[ep];B[cp];W[cq]
(;B[dn]C[perhaps this is a bad sequence...I wanted to avoid letting g3 get pressured as in the variation. (see variations)

z -- yes, G3 does start to look weak.  But your variations are interesting ...]
;W[eo];B[dm]C[In this case I don't like C7 or D7, but I must have one...D7 seems to help G3 a little, and C10 would be a perfect follow up.

z -- Indeed, it seems you must prevent a white cut at C6.];W[ci]
;B[dh]C[I did not know what else to do here. I don't feel right playing C9...but maybe C18 or D18?

z -- I think C18 is good.  It makes a definite base, and is also worth quite a few points.]
;W[dk];B[cl]C[I feel better about this...a balance of stones.

z -- The black stones around C8 look a little cramped and inefficient.  Admittedly though, if black moves out with, say, F7, then white plays C8 and is almost certainly alive, while black is losing his base.  So maybe C8 is necessary.]
;W[bg]C[I cannot find a good answer to keep a base, so I'll reach further into the center.

z -- That seems like a reasonable idea.  There is bad aji here, however; white is threatening to cut through with D15.  Black may want to prevent this eventually.]
;B[ff];W[fe];B[hg];W[jg]C[good defense by W

z -- this is one way to prevent the cut.  I can't say for sure if it is better or worse than J11.]
;B[qm]C[I like this direction but the lower side seems more urgent...I can't find a good extension for lower side though...maybe L3?

z -- Yes, making a base with G3 is urgent.  K3 would be the natural move; L3 would just invite J3.

z -- Unfortunately, defending against D15 seems urgent too.  What if white pushes through at D15 next?

z -- Still, the right side is big, so a play here is not bad.  However, R7 gives white chances to invade at R9, so I would choose R8 instead.]

(;W[jq]C[z -- see var.]
(;B[fr]C[z -- I think this is a mistake.  E2 would be better endgame than F2, so black loses points by making this exchange.  I think black should start running out right away by hitting at J4 instead.]

z -- yes, see var.]

(;B[ao]TR[dp][co][cp][bp][bq][cn][bn]C[bad move koosh! I did not see the tesuji!

z -- these things happen.  Just keep working on improving your reading.  The key observation here is that the marked groups have three liberties each - so black needs to fill one to win.]

(;W[fj];B[bf];W[cg];B[cf];W[dg];B[ef];W[cb]C[Spent three minutes trying to find a good answer to this. no luck : (

z -- it looks like black can't get a base locally and must run away.  This will be damaging to the lower side group.  Black can try B18, but it's not really better.  See var. next move.]

;B[ok];W[oj];B[pj];W[nk];B[ol];W[nl];B[nm];W[lk]
(;B[ml]C[z -- black has done quite well in this area.  But this move is not needed.  White cannot cut anything off by capturing, so it's just two points.  It would be better to connect at K11, or go back to live at H4, and take a chance on the middle group.  Objectively, the game is pretty hopeless with both groups in the bottom left capturable.  But white doesn't seem to know this, so black might be able to get away with leaving them.  Normally this would be a very bad plan - hoping your opponent makes bad moves - but otherwise the game is lost, so it can't hurt.]
