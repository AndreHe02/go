AB[pj][dj][jj][pp][dd][pd][dp]C[domgo (W) 8k vs. magman 15k (B)
Handicap 7


> Magman: OK, so I lose another game... Is it me or is the IGS ranks just really tough?
> Questions for the reviewer:
> 1. What are the obvious mistakes. I often feel like it's impossible to keep my groups connected.

mes: It's not impossible, it's just that you are choosing other things
at critical moments, often when connectivity is the most important thing
to be aware of.  I often tell very weak players in teaching games "When
you play a stronger player don't consider *anything* except
connectivity.  Keep your own stones connected and cut your opponent.  If
they do this, they usually play me two stones stronger the next game.

The big fools gold is protecting unimportant stones.  There are many
times on the go board where you cannot save all your stones.  Be aware
of which stones are important and which are not.   Also which stones are
strong and which are not.   Let the unimportant ones get cut off, and don't try to save them.  Keep
your important stones as connected as possible.  Run first, make eyes
later.  Eyemaking is terribly inefficient, it involves taking a move out
to fix shape that often has no effect on the rest of the board.  As much
as possible you want making eyes to happen as a side effect of other
things.  This is much easier when your groups are large and
interconnected.   Every time a group gets cut off and has to play a strictly eyemaking
move, it's like losing one of your handicap stones.

Your problem is not that you don't know how to keep connected, but that
you keep mistakenly thinking some other thing is more important than
connectivity, and it is almost never so.

> 2. What should I do to improve? I try to play a lot and study some kifu.

mes: Kifu is life and death?  That is good study, playing is also.

I think as much playing, reading and problem solving as you can do is
good.  But try out wierd ways of playing to see what they gain you.

Try to think in whole board terms with every move.  Think always about
group connectivity and group stability.  Never play a purely territorial
move until the endgame.  Try to make every middle game move have some
effect on the relative size of your moyos, or the strength and weakness,
or life and death of groups.

When you survey the board looking for the right place to play, the first
thing to think about is how strong each group is.  By strength, I mean,
how easily can that group live if it is attacked.

Don't waste energy attacking or defending already strong groups.  Play
so as to help your weak groups.  Don't play near strength is a proverb
and an excellent one.  Try to make your opponent play near the strength,
either yours, or their own (to make them overconcentrated).  Meanwhile
you play near weakness, defending your own, attacking your opponents.

Whenever you find yourself thinking "If I don't play here, white can
come in and ruin my territory", ask yourself whether a move by white
there seriously threatens a group, or just spoils territory?  If the
answer is that it just spoils territory, *don't* play there until the
endgame unless your move serves to attack something as well.  Attack,
defense, big points.  Until the end game, those are the only
justifications for a move.

This is not always the right way to play, but it is right much more
often than not.  I encourage you to try it and watch the results.

>Thank You

You're welcome.];W[np];B[qn]C[
 domgo 8k : hi];W[fq]C[mes:  Looking at later moves, you backed off of a
full scale attack of white.   If you don't want to fight white, just attach and build a big moyo right
now.  If you want to avoid a big fight, you have to give white something
for this privilege.]
(;B[jp]C[magman: Just seems like the natural point to attack. W stones
are far away.

mes: this is a good large scale attacking move.];W[jn];B[lo]
;W[nn]
(;B[hq]LB[lm:A][mo:B]C[magman: Get a base.

mes: That's one idea, but one that should wait in this case.  The
proverb says "run out first, then make eyes on the side."

You have to decide whether you are attacking, or being attacked.  In
this case, white is still weak.  When that's true, your first concern
should be connectivity, getting your group out in the open, and keeping
white's stones cut off from each other.    A is the direction you want to go, given where you started.  In this
case, it is feasible to simply play it.  Other possibilities include
peeping at B, and then jumping to A when white connects.  This kikashi
works to strengthen the connection to A.   There are some other
possibilities, but they probably get too complicated for a 7 stone game.

8 is a defensive move, and goes against the spirit of both 4 and 6.  If
you are going to play defense, do it to begin with, not after you've
already devoted moves to attack.    Go back and see my variations at 4  for ways to play more defensively
and be successful.   The line you have chosen is much stronger, but you
have to follow through.

Once you've started an attacking plan, give up and secure your stones
only when it is clear that you can no longer get out in the open and
keep white cut apart, or can take profit sufficient to justify
abandoning the
attack.];W[fo];B[dn];W[fm];B[dl];W[nl]C[mes: You see, now
white is surrounding you, instead of the other way around.  At this
point, you should either escape, or make life, but white will make nice
solid groups with outward influence.];B[lm]LB[mq:A]C[magman: Should this
have been at A instead?

I don't like A at all.  To play 15 for yourself, instead of letting
white get it, might be worth consideration instead of 14.    But you are already in a bad situation by letting white play 13, before
you played 14.  Now, you can't hem white in, the tables have been
turned.  You must choose between escape (letting white take important
points like 15), or letting your group be surrounded and becoming a
life and death problem.

Note that playing A hurts your lower right corner tremendously, after
white responds one point to the
right.];W[nj];B[nr]TR[nr][fm][jn][fo][fq]C[magman: I now think marked
stone is a mistake.

Hard to say.  You can't connect your two groups.  17 will hurt the lower
right, but just about anything you do down here will hurt the lower
right, and this move, with the followup, pretty much secures your stones
without further ado.  That's important.  The more stones you take to
secure yourself, the stronger white gets.  You still can generate an
attack on the triangled stones.

Your primary mistake here came at move 8.  You turned inward too early
in a running battle, and handed white the initiative at the critical
time.  Once you do that, the rest of your moves here begin to look bad,
but they are only making the best of a bad situation.];W[oq]
;B[mq];W[fc]LB[df:A][jd:B][fd:C]TR[fm][jn][fo][fq][fd]C[mes: Your move 20 is a bit suspect here.  Normally you
play this move when you have a stone already within a point of A or B.
Then if white responds by extending (up or down), he can't make the
natural 3 space extension on the right (because of the pincer already
around B, or the one you play next if you have support at A.    If you
have neither of these stones, then, after extending to C, either the
correct 3 space extension or an attachment to your corner stone one
point above A become miai, white can be very satisfied with either line
of play.  
Without either support stone in play, you should either play a simple
extension on the other side, pincer directly, or attach at C and block
(for territory), or extend up (for influence).  In certain
situations a knights move cap (one point below C), or undercut (one
point above 20) might be good.

Here, I think attach and extend is a reasonable road, to build a nice
moyo in the upper left.  You can then pressure the triangled white
stones to build a deep valley of potential that will be dangerous for
white to invade deeply.  If you can come out with sente, you may be able
to turn it into territory with just one
move.]
(;B[ec];W[nd]LB[fd:A]C[When white has ignored you, consider following through
with the implied strong threat of A, instead of responding to the
kakari];B[qf];W[jd];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd]C[mes: If you push on
top with b, the cutting point at a still helps you, plus you take the
key point at the intersection of influence areas.   Hard to say whether this is better than making the sacrifice at a
(assuming you follow it through).]
(;B[hc];W[hb]C[mes: Once you make the cut, you must extend in response
to this atari.  You are just fattening the sacrifice.]
(;B[fb]LB[ic:A][he:B]C[magman: A instead?

mes: Yes.  It's imperative.

This leaves white with a very strong group, and you haven't sealed your
moyo either.  White can make a very strong reduction, so his group is
not inefficient.  If you had a stone at B, then white would feel
somewhat overconcentrated and this would be okay for
you.];W[ic];B[gf];W[cj]C[mes: The hane is more severe and holds onto
more territory., although it is also more complicated.  Your extension
at 34 makes a white life on the side easy, but makes it difficult for
white to completely rip you apart if you make a mistake.

It's not bad, but I would play b, or c.]
(;B[di];W[ck];B[dk];W[bh]C[pushing and cutting is an option.]

(;B[cg];W[bm]C[mes: pushing into the knights move (as in 40) is
generally bad unless you can cut afterwards.  It eliminates the aji of
cutting instead.

See what happens if you play the sequence starting with b.

You can also use the threat of the cut through to seal off one side with
c.

Note that the white group is already basically alive.  Your goal now is
to contain it as small as possible, while strengthening your own groups
and securing your own territory.

I suppose it's possible to kill it, but I don't see how, and anything
with hope of doing so will be risky.

If you wanted a shot at killing the white group, you needed to respond
to the initial invasion with a hane.]
(;B[cl];W[bl];B[ci];W[bi];B[bn];W[bo]C[The pillar at b is better here,
since white cannot connect back in sente.]

;B[gb]TR[fm][fo][fq][jn][nj][nl][nn][np][oq]C[mes: This is not a good
enough ko threat, nowhere near it.  When you capture, white simply
captures back.  All you've done is steal an eye here, but white's group
is strong enough that this makes no difference.  Both 56 and the
followup it threatens are relatively small endgame plays.

Your only large ko threats are the threats to cut up and attack the
groups of triangled stones.  In fact, you have enough such threats  that
you should either win this ko fight, or have a significantly bigger ko
threat than 56 go unanswered.];W[bn]C[mes: note, white is now definitely
alive.];B[cq];W[ae]LB[hn:A][ph:C][ob:D][gk:E]TR[nd]C[mes:  This is a poor move by white, unless you
answer it.  This is an endgame play.  59 is too small, with two large
unsecured groups still on the board.  It  is an opportunity for you to
take the initiative in one of those fights.

You respond because you are worried only about *your* territory.  This
is a recipe for a losing game, responding to everything your opponent
does.  You have to consider the size of the followup, when an endgame
move like this is played early.  Unless it threatens the health of one
of your groups, it is usually not worth playing, or responding to.

As soon as you  respond, it automatically becomes a good move for white,
because it assures a little bit of profit in sente (i.e. no cost to
white).  If you play elsewhere, then this jump plus the followup has to
be bigger than what you do in two moves for this to have been worth
playing, and that's not likely at this stage, if you make good
decisions.

A-E are all possibilities.  A attacks directly, while B-E take
territory, or build your framework white threatening white.   
D is endgamish like the monkey jump white played on you, but is larger
(it secures the upper right corner), and the potential followup (a
full scale invasion of white's area, threatening to swallow the
traingled stone) is also larger.   
C and E build your framework and threaten strong attacks against white
groups that are not yet secure.  If you play any of these right, white
will either not followup that monkey jump, or regret doing so.]
;B[be];W[bk]TR[bh][bi]C[mes: I'm not sure why
white plays 61 here.  White's stones are alive without that.  If the
triangled stones had fewer liberties, there would be ways to attack and
maybe get a ko, but as it stood, white was alive before 61.  Now white
is impervious to any outside liberty taking threats.];B[ad]
LB[af:A]C[mes: I just want to make sure you're planning to
capture that white stone by blocking if it pulls out to A.

Otherwise you should play A instead.  By rights white gave up this stone
when playing 61.

Oh, of course, playing elsewhere is still a very good option.]

[am]C[magman: Was there
ever a possibility to kill W. I don't like this result.

mes: There was no possibility to kill white, unless he messed up.   After 70 *and* a play at X, you could get a ko, if white hadn't already
played one of the two triangled stones.

I have no clue why white continued to play 69 and 71, they were totally
unnecessary.

the only way you should kill this white group is if you had won the ko
at b6.  Even then, I think white probably can live.   You actually got a very good result here given some of your mistakes and
white's promising start.  in the last few moves, white gave you a bunch
of points and sente by worrying about a kill attack that wasn't there.
Look how many points you have secured as territory, versus the tiny 4
points of territory white got out of this invasion.

Plus you now have a huge strong wall, with which to attack white's weak
groups.

White has really misplayed badly here.  You can't think of a big moyo
like that as territory.  It's not, and you shouldn't need to secure it
all, unless  you are rather behind.    When white invades, don't try to
kill, just try to compress the group and give it very little territory,
while securing the rest for yourself in sente.

Your 70, btw, is a mistake.  It's worth around 8-10 points at most, and
should have been gote.  That places it firmly into endgame territory.]
;W[bj]
(;B[pq]LB[qr:A][pl:B][om:C][ph:D]C[mes: This isn't your best way to attack this white group,
because it hurts your other group as well.  You're inducing white to
play moves which hurt you on the other side.  If you want to take away
the corner, do it with A instead.    But this is not your best area to go after this white group.  Already it
is difficult for white to make even a single eye in the corner (maybe
in gote), but the weakness at B is big.  Better to secure that area.
You could also peep at C, then follow with the extension to D.   Making
white heavy, and sealing off the right side while attacking.  That way
gets complicated, but I've shown a few variations of all of these back
one.];W[or];B[pr]LB[ql:A][om:B]C[mes: Again, you are asking
white to hurt your center bottom group with each play here, and white
already can get no eyes here.

Leave this to fix up the one place you have a major weakness that white
can exploit, at A.

You want to play A, or one point to the left, or peep at
B];W[os];B[nq]TR[nn][np]C[mes: Again, a mistake.  This
does nothing to help you (you make an empty triangle) and something to
help white.  After white 77, the two triangled stones cannot be cut
apart.  This is a classic example of aji-keshi.];W[op];B[ps]
C[mes: 78 is another bad mistake.  Again, the critical
invasion point is missed in favor of an endgame point.  once you play
74, white cannot invade your corner or get eyes on the edge, leave it
until the group is settled.  Keep up the attack, by surrounding white,
or taking territory in threatening places.

If you don't play 78, the best white can do is take away 6 points from
your corner in the endgame.  There are *far* bigger points than that on
the board right now.];W[ql]
(;B[rj]LB[pl:B]C[mes: You could instead attach at B (go back for many
variations), but this is not bad.];W[rl]C[mes: 81 is not a
great move for white who needs eyeshape.  This should be lighter, or up
to connect.]
(;B[rm]C[mes: This is a poor move.  You are butting into strong
opponent's stones.  Your goal is to attack white still.   You should be able to split white -- there must be a penalty for
stepping down into your house too far.  Look back at the c variation.

Also, if you are going to respond low here, then pull back one point,
and you don't lose a liberty but gain some instead.  If you do this, it
becomes much harder for white to gain anything by attaching to your
stones.  go back to see variations at b and c.  also variation at b here
shows how white can take advantage of your 82.]
(;W[mp]
(;B[lp]TR[nq][op]C[mes: This is a big mistake.   Pull back one more, then you have enough liberties to withstand the cut.
See variations back one at b.

Also, this sequence should remind you why the marked stone exchange was
so bad for you.  If it were not there, the cut doesn't work for white.
Check out the b variation here, which shows how this goes if the marked
stones were not there (you can ignore the first two moves).  Always
keep an eye on your liberties.]

;W[dq];B[dr];W[eq]MA[eo]C[mes: Why let white play the ko?  Connect it
now and white is in big trouble.  Playing the ko leaves *you* in big
trouble.  You discovered too late that you can't simply connect this ko
because of your liberty shortages.  Once white throws in at 99, I don't
think there's any way to stop white from either connecting through, or
gaining two eyes with another capture.  There are too many local ko
threats and too many black weaknesses.

Because of the extra liberty at X if you connect to avoid the ko fight,
you have a much better tactical situation.  Your key stones will remain
connected, and white really has nothing to threaten you with.  At best,
white may be able to get some endgame profit with a placement depending
on the continuation.  right now, it doesn't work.

98 is a key point, but it is not enough to make white's life easy, as my
continuation shows.]

eyeshape.]
(;B[hr];W[hp];B[ip];W[gs];B[hs];W[jl];B[hl];W[ll]TR[jj]C[mes: You asked
why your stones get cut apart, but here is the answer -- you let them!

In the hurry to save one or two stones, you make a whole group that is
cut off.  The right play is to sacrifice unimportant stones.

the triangled stone is the important stone.  Connect it to your alive
group.    The diamond stone is irrelevant. If white can take it (which is not so
easy), let it happen.  The group that captures it already has eyeshape
and is poking out into the center.  Taking this stone will just be a bit
of territory, and not even all that much.   
OTOH, the triangled stone is holding back a reduction/invasion of your
moyo in the top left.  If it gets cut off, and is not immediately
strong, it will be a major loss.

Note that your move 26, actually makes it *easier* to capture your
diamond stone.]
(;B[kl];W[km]TR[kl]C[mes: If the marked stone was not played, you would
not feel it necessary to pull out to keep white from getting a
ponnuki.];B[kk];W[ln];B[mm];W[mn]TR[lm][mm][ll]C[mes: Here's another chance to pull
out, and not let your stones get hammered, but you worried about the
unimportant marked stones, at the expense of the rest of your group.
Note that if you don't get cut off you don't have to worry about the
life and death problem for either of the groups you get split into in
the game, and white loses the ability to make a lot of gains while you
backtrack to save your stones.    Oh, and not forgetting that you could even make a mistake and lose one
of those big groups of stones.  :)

Give up about 8 points now by playing b and letting white take a, and
all that never comes to pass.  (In fact, white shouldn't bother to take
a now, but leave it for the endgame, so you might end up with it
anyway)

Once again, you pass up an opportunity to connect your groups, in favor
of saving a couple stones.]
(;B[ml];W[ik]MA[kj]C[mes: 134 is another big mistake.  What does it get
you?  You can't disconnect white.  It doesn't create a liberty shortage.
Instead it creates one for you.  If white plays at 134, you play at X,
then white has the empty triangle and you don't.  Don't force white into
doing what white wants.

b is your move here.]
(;B[jk];W[il]LB[ij:A][hi:B]C[mes: Again, 136 is a mistake.  To the left is where your
strength is, run your group in that direction, with A or B, and it has
more options.   Also, be aware of your liberty problems.  A is a key point for your 4
stone clump, giving it 5 liberties, a magic number that typically makes
a string of stones *much*
safer.];B[mj];W[gj];B[gl];W[fk]C[mes: With 140, you are
worried about your "territory", when you should be more worried about
your weak group.  You have a play at b which gives your group a lot more
potential.  Worry a lot about any group that does not have two sure
eyes, and is in white's house.

Similarly, when white has a group without two sure eyes in your  house,
you should be thinking about how to harass it.]

eye.]
(;W[ko];B[bs];W[hf]C[mes: Here, I think you should wedge and keep white
cut off.  Or hane at c.  These plays give you hope of connecting through
yourself.

At a minimum, if you are going to peep, peep on the side of your weak
group.

Again, you are trying to hold territory, at the expense of
connectivity.]

because of the threat to connect and cut.]
(;B[ji];W[ij];B[jg];W[mi]TR[ll]LB[li:A]C[mes: You probably want to capture at b,
instead of a.

There is a general principle about aji.  First, see that it is the aji
of the marked stone that keeps you from playing the obvious response at
A.  You are forced by this to back track a bit, and secure your
liberties.

In general,whenever you have to backtrack to take care of aji, get rid
of as much as possible.  Remove key stones, or get as close to removing
them as you can.  The idea is that you don't want your opponent to use
that aji more than is absolutely necessary.]
(;B[mk];W[li]C[mes: It turns out that the critical cut off sequence at b
still gives you something here.]
(;B[ki];W[lj];B[lk];W[kg]C[mes: With b instead, you might at least have
a fighting chance at finding a ko or something.]
(;B[lg];W[kf];B[kh];W[nf];LB[ng:A]C[magman: I resign.

mes: I'm not sure that's right.  Between the possible cuts, and the
weakness at A, I think you still have just enough liberties to make this
fight interesting.  If you live, the game is still playable.  I think
it's probably possible to get something out of this, though it's beyond
my reading to say for sure.

In any case, the reason your stones get disconnected is because you've
let them.  You try to save small territory, or small groups of
unimportant stones at the expense of important stones or whole groups.

In a recent thread on rec.games.go, someone asked how to get stronger,
and Bill Spight responded, "throw more of your stones away."

There is wisdom.  When a capture is threatened, always ask yourself
three questions.  1.  Does saving/capturing those stones affect the
eyeshape/life of a group (mine or the opponents)?  Does
saving/capturing these stones cut groups apart or connect them together
or both? If any of these things are true, they are important stones and
probably worth saving or capturing.  Otherwise they may be unimportant.

2. a) Do those stones occupy a key strategic point for one side or the
other?  b) if so, can the main purpose be achieved by squeezing around
even if the stones are captured?    If a but not b, it may be important
to save or capture those stones, depending on their strategic value
relative to other points on the board.  If a and b, or neither (and you
answered no to question 1), then the stones are unimportant.

3.  Is the capture very large?  Even if the stones are unimportant, it's
possible for the capture to be large enough to justify, but it must be
much larger than you probably think.  Calculate the endgame value.  If
there is a miai value of 10-15 points, or a deiri value of 20-30 points
(a 10-15 stone capture), it *may* be worth taking in the middle game,
if the game is relatively quiet.  It's not worth as much as a good
attack or key defensive move, nor is it worth as much as a play on the
line between opposing moyos, or a good invasion/reduction.  To beat most
strong middle game plays, it's got to be worth around 40 points deiri
(a 20 stone capture in gote).])
