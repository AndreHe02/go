C[Altos [7k\]: Hi

Hi. After playing white in this game, I felt that even though I won, There were too many close calls. Also, much of my reading was off. I've been away from GO completely for a month, so I feel that my strength has diminished. That's why I want to check with comments; Thank you!

A: Hi, my name is Avi Ben-Nun, an Israeli player about 3K. I am not that strong, so take my comments with caution.

My main advise to you is to imprve your overall reading of the board. Try to first strengthen you weak groups and attack the opponents weak grous; If you can do it with the same plays, this is the best. 

I hope it helps -
Feel free to comment and provide feedback.

Thanks, Avi];B[dp]C[dakachi [8k\]: hi

C[I'm not very familiar with this joseki, and nowadays playing on the forth line worries me about invasions more mainly because my reading ability isn't in top condition.]
;W[pf];B[kd]C[A: Black does follow the joseki; This leaves the Black group floating.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[pj];B[pl];W[ql];B[qk];W[pk];B[qm];W[rl];B[pm]
;W[rm];B[pn];W[qo]C[I kind of feel that this isn't a good move. Any suggestions?

A: You are right, S5 is better shape, and elimianate the S6 empty triangle.]
;B[qp];W[iq];B[kq];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[cj]C[A: J3 is still weak - I would play J5 here; This also leaves aji for N3 later]
;B[cf]C[A: Approaching from F17 is better, since it has miai of connecting to L16 and invading the 3-3 point. Now black creates another weak group, while O16 is still floating.]
;W[ce];B[dh]C[A: D14 is a must; Otherwise White build s a strong attack (as he actually did)]
;W[df]C[A: This is the vital point];B[cg];W[fd]C[A: My feeling is that White should have attacked by C11 - another vital point. The corner is strong enough already.]
;B[ci]C[Now.. this part. I hate running with no eyes. in my first days of returning to the GO world, I would try to kill my opponent too hard and end up dying :( I practically died here as well.

A: C11 let white tun away, and by the way continue tha attack. I read the situation as follows: both C14 and D4 black groups are not settled, so trying to connect them will settle them. So I would play here D10. White C10 will probably live small, but black will build center thickness so he can attend to O16 and attacking F3.]

;W[ph]C[Was this move OK? Or should I have played more locally instead of playing elsewhere? What's the term.... I can't remember.hehe

A: (Playing elsewhere is called tenuki). Anyway, reading the overall board tells me that you must play from the other direction, i.e. H12 or something similar. The reason - Both black groups (E14 and O16 are not settled, while white H10 is also weak. Whoever is going to take the initiative here will gain.]

;B[hl];W[jj];B[ip];W[hp];B[io];W[jq];B[kp];W[jp]C[A: Never push if you do not intend to cut! This reduces your own liberties; You might also want to approach from the other side later, and now you eliminate this option.]
;B[jo];W[ho];B[lj];W[nk];B[nl];W[mk];B[lk]C[A: Look at O9-N9: Did you gain anything, apart from strengthening M10?]
;W[bl]C[A: The simplest and safest now is H13];B[bm];W[cl];B[cm]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[di];B[ch];W[bj];B[kh];W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[ii]
C[A: MUST plan H13... Black cannot push with H11 becasue of G11 (Try it).]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[fi];B[hi];W[gi]C[A: Why not capture?];B[pc];W[qc]
;B[oc];W[ih];B[ji];W[jh];B[ki];W[ml];B[nm];W[jc];B[kc]C[Is this a mistake for my opponent? When I read it out, his 2 stones could have lived.

A: Yes, Black could have save his stones with K17 a few plays ago; but this way the G12 group is floating and white needs to attend to it urgently...]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[be];B[af];W[hn];B[jd]C[A: G12 situation is getting worse...]
;W[hb];B[pe]C[A: Black could have attacked G12 already];W[qe]
;B[oe];W[mm];B[mn];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[lo];W[er];B[dr];W[ep]
;B[dq];W[fr]C[A: This a common mistake - you save a few points and lose sente. You should take another big point to gain more, and if black capture you gain sente again. By the way - check that black cannot capture white even if he invades.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[rf];W[re];B[of];W[pg];B[ie]C[A: Sever attack]
;W[he]C[I probably should have played at F13 right? Fortunately, my opponent made a mistake too.]
;B[if];W[fg];B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[ig]C[Up to here, I think my group is dead. Or is there some other way?]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[kf]C[A: Severe mistake of course];W[ff]C[After here, my opponent seems to have lost concentration.]
;B[nh];W[ij];B[lm];W[ll];B[km];W[fe]C[A: End of comments - white leads by far.]
