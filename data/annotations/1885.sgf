C[To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.

I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong, but it seems as though
I end up trailing badly after the fuseki no matter what I try.
If I try to attack my opponent and prevent him from getting a
large moyo, I end up with weak groups.  If I try to play for
strong groups, I end up conceding a very large moyo.  (And I'm
not very successful at ending up with strong groups, either!)

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger

Hi! My name is Martin (thus starting my comments with M:) and
i hope i can give you a few usefull and understandable comments.
:-)];B[cd];W[pp];B[pc];W[cp];B[qf];W[qj]C[Fedya: I've been told that as a rule of thumb, it's better to
approach from the 'open' side, that being the one on which you
already have a stone.  I presume, therefore, that this would
be better than something in the K16/17 area.

M: This is not a bad move, but maybe not the best. To build up
your own position a move at J3 or J4 would be most common. To
reduce your opponents development, a move around K16 - as you
suggested - would be good. If you approach a shimari (like here
in the upper right corner), you should take the side 'in front
of' the shimari, which is here the upper side. The reason is,
that this side is more valuable for your opponent. Imagine first
two black stones at K17/K15 and than two black stones at R10/P10.
You will see, that the stones K17/K15 work much nicer with the
shimari, building a large, box-like shape. So, if possible, approach
here.];B[nq];W[pm]C[Fedya: Would this have been better at R7?  Or should I have played
something entirely different, like M3, instead?

M: If you play on the right side, Q6 would be more common. But
more important: i think that a pincer (around) L3 woukld be a
good idea. If you can play a pincer, which is an extension at
the same time (here: an extension from your stone in the lower
left corner), you should play it. It is an dual-purpose move
(attacking your opponent and building your own position at the
same time), thus working very efficiently.];B[kq];W[ec]C[Fedya: Yes, I know this violates the principle of approaching
on the open side.  But I'd prefer to approach a 3-4 stone at
5-3 instead of 3-6, and I was also afraid of ceding a large moyo
along the top to Black.

M: Well, there are two things to say. First: you are right about
aproaching a 3-4 stone from this side. Only 3-3 and 4-4 stones
can be approached equaly good from both sides. Approaching this
stone from the left side would give black the chance to make
another shimari (E16 or E17), which would be too good for black.
Second (and more important): This move is not good. (And it is
so because of the same reason i just advised you to play white
8 on the lower side.) Now black has the chance to play a pincer
(maybe J17), which will work very nicely with his shimari on
the upper right. Black 11 at J17 would be even better, than white
8 at L3 because the black position at the upper right is even
stronger, than whites in the lower left.

That is the reason you suggested white 6 around K16/K17: you
don't want to play E17 because the pincer is too good for black.]
;B[df]C[M: Mistake! As just explained, black must play a pincer here.]
;W[hd]C[Fedya: Should I have played at H17 instead?

M: H17 would be a little more more solid. If black approaches
your position at K17, you could answer more aggressive after
H17. But it is not much of a difference.];B[jc];W[hb]C[M: Very solid, but whites position gets a little overconcentrated.
Maybe white should play at K15: that is developing toward the
center and preventing black from enlarging is moyo at the same
time.];B[mc]C[M: Not good! K15 is much better.];W[cj]C[M: Ok. But making a shimari at the lower left seems big too.]
;B[ch]C[M: Now black is building a overconcentrated shape.]
;W[cm]C[M: Since white h`s no shimari at the lower left, E10 is not so
attracktive (maybe that's the reason why i'd like to make a shimari
with white 16), but you could play this stone at least at the
4th line.];B[qo]C[Fedya: I didn't see this move coming.  Is there any good way
to handle it?  I felt as though I lost a whole lot of territory
and didn't get anything for it in reply.  Up to here I thought
I was doing well.  This is the move the makes me wonder whether
I should have played at R7 instead of Q7.

M: I also didn't see it coming. I think it is not so strong.
Still, white 8 would be better at Q6. But you have to know, that
a shimari starting from the 4-4 point does not secure the corner
completely. So you haven't lost a whole lot of territory, because
it would have taken one more move by white to make it 'territory'.
Right now it is your area of influence, which can be turned into
territoty later. There is always aji for your opponent. But I
think,
that black R3 would be the better attack.];W[po]C[Fedya: I looked at R4, but could only see a bunch of complicated
variations.  I figured if I played that, I'd be more likely to
lose the entire group.

M: I think this move is OK.];B[qn]
(;W[pn]C[M: I think you should play R7 here. See variation.]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[qq]C[Fedya: All I've got on the right is thickness.  I've been told
you're supposed to use thickness to get territory by forcing
your opponent's stones towards your thickness when you attack
them -- but there's nothing to attack.

M: Even stronger players than me often can't say what is the
best way to use thikness :-)

What is important here is, that you just started the build thickness.
Most important: you should not alow black to connect his corner
group to his two stones on the lower side. Thus whites next move
must be at q3!!];W[fq]C[Fedya: I had sente and absolutely no idea what to do with it.
This looks like the biggest part of the board, but I get the
feeling it only helped make Black's group at the bottom stronger
since Black's response is fairly obvious.

M: As I just mentioned - you didn't have sente. If you had sente,
w26 is a good move! Alltough now you'd wish that w18 would be
around E10. Now one can see that the timing of some of the opening
moves of white and black was not so strong.];B[hq]C[M: Black at Q3 (or similar move) seems much more important to
me.];W[go]C[M: OK.];B[cb]TR[hb][ec][hd]C[Fedya: And now I'm going to end up with a weak group on the top.
I try to prevent my opponent from getting a big moyo on the bottom,
and this is what happens.  If I had played to shore up my group
on the top, Black will be able to reduce me in the bottom left.

M: Yes. That is more a less the basic principle of GO: You can't
have everything! If you take one big point, you opponent takes
the other. That is OK. If you really need two big moves in a
row to win - you made a mistake earlier. The good news is: You
opponent can't take two big points in a row eigther.

B29 is a big move, but you should not worry too much. Your group
is not so weak
that it will die. But you have to reenforce it.];W[hf]C[M: The idea is OK, but I would like K15 much better, because
it also prevents black from expanding his moyo with the same
move.];B[gc]TR[hb][ec][hd]C[Fedya: I *really* didn't see this coming.  Now the group is in
big trouble.  And I always thought the marked stones formed a
strong group.  Go figure.

M: Like the last time, when you didn't see your opponents move
coming, I think this is not a good move for black. It's too
aggressive! It may take away a few points from white, but it
misses a big chance to enlarge black's own position. As Black
I would be happy to play K15. That would expand my position on
the upper right and prepare an attack at b31 for later.

As white just remember: You don't have to save all your stones.
Just keep the larger part of the group save and use your stones
to prevent black from making to much points on the upper side.
That is good enough.];W[hc]C[Fedya: I played this because I wanted to make sure I'd be able
to keep a connection to the center.

M: Yes. Good move!];B[fd];W[fb]C[M: F17 seems also possible and is (maybe) a little better shape
for building eyes. But your move is also OK.];B[ed];W[gb]C[Fedya: At least now I've got an eye on the side.  But I need
to get one in the center as well.

M: You don't have to connect your stones with this move now (that
is the advantage of w34 compared to F17). But you're right: this
gives you one eye (in gote) on the upper side. But I would clearly
prefer to play K15 instead - for the same reasons you played
it 12 moves later.];B[fp]C[Fedya: I didn't see this either.

M: And again I think this move is not so good. If black want
to reduce whites position, he should play from the top (maybe
E10), because whites position is low there.]
(;W[ep]C[Fedya: Would it have been better to play G4 instead?

M: Difficult to say, what is better. You could fight here, because
your position is strong enough. But things will get complicated.
See variation.];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq]C[Fedya: Should I have sacrificed the G5 stone instead of F3 by
playing instaed of G5 with my last move?

M: No, I think this variation is better, because (a) it's sente,
(b) you could expand your position with E10 or E11 later, (c)
you could press on the black position on the lower side later.
But on the other hand: black has allready quite a territorial
advantage (not just because of this move).];W[dq];B[er];W[dr]
;B[fr]
(;W[en]C[M: I think you should play E10 or E11 (maybe even F11) instead.
OK, black could cut, but he would have a hard time, if he does.
See variation];B[ei];W[je]C[Fedya: I knew that this group had one eye at the top, but I wanted
to do something that would help get me a second eye while reducing
Black at the same time.

M: As I commented earlier - the idea is good. The timing is not
so good. But since your opponent hasn't played there eighter,
this is not such a big problem. Right now it's difficult for
me to say wich move is biggest/most urgent: Q3, K15 or E9/E10.
I think I'd play Q3 first (this is urgent for so long), expecting
black to answer, and go to E9/E10 then.];B[kd]C[M: Your opponent answers your move localy, so you still have
the chance to play Q3 and E9/E10!];W[ke]C[M: You don't really want to push here! Playing one (or two) moves
here is good, because you can stabilize your group and prevent
your opponent from taking the initiative. But if you keep on
pushing, you gain litte, but your oipponent gets alot of territory.
You are removing your possibilities of reducing the upper right
territory later in the game!!];B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[ne]
C[Fedya: Have I given up too much territory in the top right?

M: Yes!!!];W[qp]C[M: I think this corner is the most urgert area to play, but i'd
prefer Q3. Black has to play in the corner and you could reduce
the territory on the lower side later.];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[rm]
;B[pq];W[hp]C[M: Good! If black could play at H5 first, it would be very big
for black.];B[gq];W[ip];B[iq];W[jp]C[M: I think you should stop pushing now. You forced black in a
low position. That's good. Now you can play elsewhere. I'd play
E9 now.];B[lo]C[M: Not good. There is little to gain for black here. Black E9
would be much bigger.]
(;W[hn]C[Fedya: I had to play something to serve as a ladder-breaker should
Black try to play at H5.  Is there a better place to play than
this?

M: This move is not necessary. As long as the three white stones
have a liberty at K3 you can catch a cutting stone without a
ladder, using a net (jap.: geta). See variation.

But even if the cut you be possible for black: saving three stones
would not help you now. Play a big move elswhere, and if black
cuts (bH5) fight back (wJ6).];B[lm]C[Fedya: Now the thickness I have on the right side looks like
something from which I won't get anything worthwhile.

M: Well, yes. But black's last move is not good eighter. Black
gains little there. E9 would be much bigger.];W[kh]C[M: This equalizes b69. Whites group is already save. So white
gains almost nothing here.];B[dk]C[M: Now it happened. Big move. E9 would be better shape for black.]
;W[ck];B[dj]C[M: If black had played 71 at E9, he would not have to pull back
now.];W[dl];B[el];W[em];B[fl];W[jq];B[jr];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[no];W[mn];B[ln]C[M: Mistake. Black should sacrifice one stone! Since he has a
strong position around F8, he can always reduce whites position
from the top. Now he created a wead group - a target, which white
can attack.];W[nn];B[ie]C[Fedya: Yet another move I didn't see.  I thought I was going
to get a good deal of territory in the center, but I end up with
almost nothing.

M: Another evaluation-problem. White has not a good deal of territory
in the center. The center is too open, to have a lot of territory
there. All white had - and still has! - is savety.

Anyhow, i think this black stone simply get captured.]
(;W[id];B[if]
(;W[he]C[M: If white plays at J13, black gets captured. See variation.]
;B[ig];W[jd];B[hh]C[M: Letting this stones escape, was not good for white, but black
not playing in the most urgent area - which is the lower right
center. So white has the chance to take the initiative tgere.]
;W[kc]C[M: Nice, but not big enough. I'd play a move around  K9/L9!!
Trying to capture the three white stones in a large scale and
threatening to build a huge position in the lower right and right
center. White has a potential of 30 points there!];B[lc];W[kb]
;B[lb];W[jb]C[M: With this sequence, you made a few points on the upper side,
but you end up in gote. That was  to small.];B[hl]C[M: Good.]
;W[ci]C[M: Small moves. Black is leading about 20 points. White needs
a bigger move.];B[di]C[M: ?? Why not B12?];W[dh]C[M: ?? Again: Why not B12?]
;B[dg]C[M: ?? And again: Why not B12?];W[eh]C[Fedya: This was just a case of bad reading.

M: Yes - on both sides!!];B[fh];W[bh]C[M: Finally!];B[cg];W[bg]
;B[bf];W[dc];B[cc];W[dd];B[de];W[fc]C[M: All this last moves have been small, but black always answered.
But now ...];B[im]C[M: ... black is the first to play in the important area.]
;W[in]C[M: This move gains white 1 point. Moves like this should be played
in the late endgame.];B[jm];W[rg]C[Fedya: I have a feeling you're going to criticize this move,
but I thought I was trailing by a lot, and needed to get some
more territory.  I absolutely can't let Black play at S11.

M: Compared to the last 4 white moves, this one is much better.
Localy S11 would be better shape. But white is still approx.
15 points short. He would need something even bigger, like invading
in the upper right corner. But that would most likely not work.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[of];W[ff]C[Fedya: I played this to serve as a ladder-breaker for the stones
at D/E 12.  But would P13 be bigger?

M: P12 (better than P13) seems bigger. But since black can reduce
the white right side territory from his center position, it is
not much of a difference. It would not be enough for white to
win the game.];B[eg];W[ee]C[Fedya: This is a mistake.  Fortunately, Black missed the proper
reply.

M: You are right.]
(;B[oh]C[Fedya: Black should have played at F15.  See the variation.

M: Your taktical analysis is correct, but this might be the bigger
move for black.];W[pg];B[og];W[pf];B[pe]
(;W[ph]C[M: I'd play this one rater at Q11. See variation.]
;B[oi];W[pi]C[M: Small. I'd rather play first T14 (and follow up's), which
is sente, and then K10.];B[jj]C[M: Big.];W[fg]C[M: Also OK.]
;B[gg];W[gf];B[hg]C[M: Small.];W[mh]C[M: First (T14 an then) P10 and come back for N12 later.]
;B[mm]C[M: Better O8];W[nm];B[nl];W[om]C[M: Ouch! That move brings 0 points (in gote)!! Back can't cut
through the bamboo-joint.];B[mk];W[sf]C[M: Good.];B[re];W[se]
;B[sd];W[sg];B[rd];W[op];B[np];W[oq];B[or]
(;W[oo]C[Fedya: I looked at O2 and Q2 but didn't think I could get anything
profitable out of either.

M: Well, at least P5 in sente (because of the possible cut).]
;B[nr];W[oj];B[li];W[lh];B[mi]C[M: L11 is bigger.];W[nj]C[M: L11 is bigger.]
;B[mj];W[ki];B[kj];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[pk]C[M: Too deep!];W[qk]
C[M: No. You can capture b169 by simply playing P9.];B[ok];W[pj]

;B[db];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[fm];W[fn]C[M: Again a 0 point move.]
;B[ag];W[ai];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[br]C[M: It is not really a mistake, but if you don't need the eye-shape,
it is better to defend against the cut with a solid connection
at C2. If you play B2, black hast two ko-threats for later.]
;B[ol];W[pl];B[nk];W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[nb]C[M: This is -1 point for black. M16 would be much better.]
;W[nf];B[ng];W[mg]C[M: Better first M16, then E18, then L6 (all of them are sente)
and then E14 (which is reverse sente).];B[ni];W[jh];B[ih];W[kn]
;B[km];W[ld]C[M: Yes! That as the biggest point for both players for some time.]

be sente for your opponent) first.];B[af];W[eb]C[M: Yes.];B[da]

[bq][cq][ar][cr][as][bs]C[Fedya: I was rather surprised that Black won by only 20.  I thought
I was much further behind than that.

M: You actually lost the game in the opening. Black was 20 points
(komi not included) ahead after approx. 40 moves and he kept
this
lead for the rest of the game. You made some mistakes later,
but so did black.

After black 87 you had a good chance to counterattack and go
for a big territory at the lower right center - which (I guess)
never occured to you.

So, what advice can i give?

(1) Play more active (that means not necessary: agressive) in
the fuseki. You didn't made so bad moves (except omitting Q3)
and black didn't made so good moves, but he attacked and you
responded, he attacked and you responded again. He was active,
you always re-active. That is how he got the  advantage. Closely
related to this is ...

(2) Try hard to keep/regain sente (examples for not doing so:
w36, w100, w116, w118, w144). When you defend, ask yourself:
"Can i afford to leave this
position like it is?" You should not end up with weak groups,
but you could sacrifice a few points, a few stones, to gain sente.
In the opening, sente may be worth up to 20 points (if you really
make use of it).

(3) Try to improve your evaluation of bord positions (which means:
ask stronger players to do this for you and learn from it). This
is also a psychlogical problem. Sometimes your opponent moves
uppsets you, because you think you lost a great deal of territory/influence.
Actually your loss might be not so big at all. It just seemed
so, because your evaluation was not correct. A stone on the 4-4-point
does not mean territory in the corner, a wall toward the center
does not mean territory in the center. If your positional judgement
gets stronger, you could find weaknesses of your opponents easier
and could easier keep your calm during your opponents attacks.

(4) Play not every pushing move, which you can get (examples:
w50-w54, w112-w116, w128-w134). Ask youself (a) do I gain as
much as my opponent and (b) is it sente ??

(5) If your groups (or the groups of yout opponent) are stabilized,
don't always fight for single stones (not to keep, nor to capture
it) unless they have an important function (such as cutting stones).
You and your opponent have fought to capture/defend small number
of stones and omitted big/urgent moves on the other hand in this
game several times. This is also closely connected to the question
of taking/keeping sente.

What I liked about your playing style is, that you played solid
(unlike me ;-). During the whole game none of your groups were
really in danger. That is important. If you play more active,
keeping sente more often, in the future, you should do so from
a strong position. If you end up with a lot of weak groups, playing
active will gain you little or even become imposible.
