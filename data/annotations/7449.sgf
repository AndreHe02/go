C[Hello. Please help me, saying where my worse mistakes are. In this game, I killed two groups of my opponent, but I didn't win the game. I wanna know why it happened. Thank you very much for helping me,
Farley (AVAB).

Reviewer: Pete, 4k AGA/KGS

Pete: Hello! Hope this review is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can email me at: pete0877@gmail.com.]

(;B[cq]C[PETE: technically this is not a joseki ... See variation for the Magical Sword joseki.]

(;W[dp]C[PETE: this is not good for white because it ends up getting hit on the head of 2 stones. The exception is the Magical Sword joseki shown in earlier variation. 

So because this is a bad move on white's part, black's earlier non-joseki move at C3 has been balanced out.]
;B[cp];W[eo];B[co]LB[ep:A]C[PETE: you can see that white has some problems to solve. Cut at A would be bad of course.]

(;W[cr]C[PETE: this moves gives away sente and doesn't really buy white any territory. Black has utilized the situation correctly here ...]
;B[br];W[dr];B[en]C[PETE: good move by black -- need to isolate the stone at D8.]
;W[fo];B[dm]
(;W[cl]C[PETE: seems somewhat strange to extend down .. see variation]

(;B[jq]C[PETE: first thing I would do is I would put more pressure on the two white stones. The will probably live but if black gets stronger, it will have easier time attacking the other white group. So this move seems a bit too early to me personally.
But as far as attack on the larger white group, this seems like the perfect place to strike. At this point in the game, black is doing great.]
;W[hq];B[mq];W[oq];B[pj]LB[ci:A]C[PETE: This moves makes as much territory as move at A would, BUT move at A is much better because it does not give sente away. Black can make a ton of territory by chasing the white group out.]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[pl];B[od]LB[dc:A][ce:C][ch:B]C[PETE: similar comment on this move - although it makes territory, there is better way to make territory on the left side. Move at P16 will always be there as long as black manages to keep sente in play on the left side. Another BIG reason why move on the left side is more important is that it not only can allow you to build territory in sente, it also is a great extension from the stone at A. If white gets to play at B, it not only gives white stones safety, it also prepares for attack on the stone at A by white playing later on at C. The whole left side would end up being dead for black.]
;W[fn]LB[ch:A]C[PETE: Move at A is a lot more urgent for white.]

(;B[fm];W[gm]
(;B[cm]C[I think this move was a mistake. I lost the chance of attacking c8 and d8 stones. But I felt like my group was in danger.

PETE: I agree, this move was over-protective and allows white to seal black in.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[el];B[ch]C[PETE: good move.]
(;W[di];B[ci];W[bm];B[bn];W[cj];B[dh];W[ei]C[Now the group is strong enough to survive.]

(;B[de]LB[dd:A]C[PETE: this black move seems a bit too slow and over-concentrated. The ideal extension from the 3 stones would be at A. See variations.]
;W[im]LB[jc:A]C[PETE: very slow move. Top side is much more important. If black gets to play at A, the game is over (as long as the lower-side group lives :)]
;B[nr];W[or];B[lo];W[jp];B[iq];W[ip];B[kp];W[hr];B[nj]LB[jc:A]
C[PETE: seems to me that move at A is a lot more valuable because is is an extension for two corners and builds territory.
This move however is not that bad either. Box shapes are good. It also removes influence the white stones have in the center. Either way black is way, way ahead at this point. You might need to consult a dan-level player to figure out if A is in fact better than O10.]

(;W[lc]LB[gc:B][jc:A][mc:C][kr:D]C[PETE: it would be more comfortable for white to play at A. This way he has ability to extend to B or C depending on what Black does. 
Also, before this invasion which will lose sente, white should probably fist attack the stones at the bottom around D.]
;B[jc]LB[ic:A]C[My idea here was, while atacking the m17 stone, make territory on the right and left upper sides.

PETE: Definitely good idea and I would follow the same direction. As of right now Black is way ahead. Black could play more conservative move at A, making invasion inside the top-right area less likely.]
;W[le]
(;B[kd];W[pc]C[I wasn't expecting this tenuki.

PETE: yes, a bit surprising. Sometimes you see play like this in high-dan games where the idea behind moves like this is to create confustion.]
;B[pd]C[AVAB [8k\]: Where are you from?

PETE: I think black's response is consistent with the original strategy -- so I think this move is good.]
