;W[lo]C[I played this game without hesitating and thinking for a second. I don't think that it's bad but since K4 is not on the 3rd line maybe there are better ways.
For example: how about attaching at P3 and taking sent to play something like H3?

reid: I agree.  Both with your alternate plan, and with your opinion that this way is not bad either.

Black's first two moves declare an intent to make the upper side a moyo.  White wants to disturb that plan, and black's subsequent moves make it fairly easy for white to cause trouble.  I think black P4 would be better around Q10.  If he really wants to invade white (not really consistant with his moyo intentions), a third line move, something like L3 would make it easier to build a base quickly.

The current situation looks like black will chase white into his moyo, so white is happy with that too.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[lm]C[Here I was thinkin again wether to start running (which I didn't like because wb is already strong on the right and would also gain strengh on the left. So I came up with the following in the real game.

reid: Because white ends so close to that three-stone wall, you often see M4 instead of N4.]
;W[oq]LB[jn:C][kn:F][ln:E][io:B][jo:A][kp:D]C[reid: OK, I don't like this move for white.  The explanation is a bit difficult, but I think it's important, so I'll go into some detail here:

(Edit: now that I've been through the entire game, I'll say that I think this is the game-losing move).

Go is supposed to be about territory, but by now you are starting to understand that territory is a by-product of strength and weakness.

At the moment (before P3), white's right and left side groups are very stable (strong).  The F3 and K4 stones have a base against the bottom, but it's a bit too wide, and one of them is fourth-line, so this could be considered slightly uncomfortable (weak).  Black's P8 group has no real eyes yet, but it has access to the center - not settled, but not exactly in danger (weak).

The white pair (N4, M5) are nearly surrounded, but if course it's white's move now.  These two stones are separating two somewhat weak black groups.  Strategically, that's a very beneficial situation.  White doesn't want to sacrifice them unless he is positive that doing so gives him a game-winning position.  I don't think that's the case here.  Black capturing with L6 helps black's top-side moyo immensely!

As you mentioned, the black P8 stones are stronger than white.  But looking at the whole situation, I think white's splitting position here makes them stronger than the overall black position.  White should save these stones.

The key is to find a move that pulls out the white stones (maintaining the separation) without helping black.  One often sees a sequence like white A through E in a situation like this, but that seems to help black get stronger, and perhaps even leads to black linking to P4 along the bottom.

I think the best move here is for white to simply pull out once more with the diagonal move at F.  This doesn't give black any help at all.

After white F, the situation is: black has two weak-ish groups, white splits them with one weak group.  White is ahead on territory, black is ahead on influence, but the splitting attack mitigates black's influence.  And white is still running towards black's moyo.  If black wants to strengthen either of his two weak groups, he's not going to get any help from white.

White F is a difficult move to play.  It feels passive.  But white needs to let the game develop so that black's weaknesses start to work against him.  Patience is required!]

;B[jo];W[hm];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[do]C[ffm2 [-\]: brb, klo]
;W[co];B[fm]C[What do you think about the sequence until here?

reid: Compare this situation with the discussion back at move 16.  Now white and black have one weak group each, and black is running towards his own position.  White has no real hope of threatening the F5 stones, so the H5 group is a burden.]
;W[gn]C[I think this is a very bad move from white

reid: I agree.  It's too easy to get the mind set that: "It's sente, it must be good".  In actuality, the only good move is the move that *must* be played next.

Here, black cannot separate H7 from H5, so there is no need for white to play G6.]
;B[dm]C[Because of exactly this response];W[hk]C[No choice, right?

reid: Right.  But how much better if the G6/D7 exchange had not been made...]
;B[di];W[cm];B[dl];W[hi]C[reid:  Hmm, I'm thinking this would also be better without the C7/D8 exchange, but that's a bit more difficult to support.  My feeling is that the center white stones need every bit of help they can get and D8 definitely doesn't help.  Black C7 would be gote.  So I would let it go to much later in the game and just play H11 directly.  But there's no doubt that C7 is a big move.]
;B[jd];W[cd]C[I had and still have that this might be the wrong direction since D11 is at D11 and not D10 and also because of C7.
So better playing on the right side?

reid: White is in a difficult position here.  That center white group is very painful - too big to fail, but not doing anything useful for white.  A good illustration of territory being a side effect of strength and weakness.

The right side is also not very important because of R8 (and R17 is still available).

White is ahead on territory, but it's difficult to see a winning path because of the center weak group.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[dg]C[I think B should hane here.

reid: I think white realizes what you said earlier about C7 making the left side small.  He is focussed on the center weak group (as he should be - it's his winning ticket).  Pulling back instead of hane is black's way of not helping white.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[jj]C[Ultimately White had it too easy I think

reid: You mean easy in the upper left corner?  Perhaps, but black's plan all along has been the upper side, and that's still looking good for him.]
;B[pf];W[iq];B[jq];W[if]C[Better on K14?

reid: Difficult choice.  But in subsequent moves we can see that black doesn't really care - he just declares victory and takes his moyo.]
;B[oc];W[kf];B[le];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[li]C[Here I was thinking wether to play M11 or R11. But I thought "urgent moves before big moves". M11 secured the whole group and made some points.

reid: Probably safest.  But of course, points in the center are the most expensive to make.  White makes about 10 in the center, black about 40 in the corner.]
;B[qi]C[Of course.];W[nr]C[I think this is very big! But bigger than D8 I wonder?

reid: I think D8 is not so big because it's under-cut on both sides.  Black takes sente here (in a couple of moves) to play D8, but he needs gote twice (after P2 and after E18) to get about 16 points on the left side (we can assume he would have gotten a few points there anyway).  He gives up more than that on the bottom and top edges.]

;B[ad];W[ph]C[Only endgame from here. I think I gained much through it but not enough at the end :-)

reid: Yeah, that upper right moyo is just too huge.  

The primary lesson to take away from this game is how black got that moyo as a direct result of the weak white center group.  Which in turn happened from sacrificing M5.

A secondary lesson: don't help your opponent (G6, D13).

Good luck, play strong!
