C[I think that B played a rather strange opening, and I as W felt during the game clearly ahead. Nevertheless, I as W couldnt keep this - felt - advantage.

Suddenly B was ahead, and without opponent's fatal mistake that allowed me to invade me at lower side B would have won easily.

My question is where I as W did make the mistakes. Slack, slow moves, wrong direction etc. I am focused mainly on first 100 moves.

I recorded the game afterwards out of my mind. The order of moves after move 100 is not correct anymore.

[EV\] This is your reviewer.  Your opening was fine, and your direction of play was good.  I did not see any large mistakes, but I think you missed a few opportunities to play more forceful moves in the early fighting.  You let B off too easy in the part of the board where you had an advantage.  I will try to point out a few of these plays.]

;B[qo];W[rq];B[pg];W[oe];B[ql];W[nj]C[[EV\] This move is not bad, but it seems a little slack to me.  W needs to get a better result than B on the right side of the board, to compensate for the two extra B stones on the left side of the board.  I would prefer something more active like S9, preventing B from settling his group.]

(;B[ng]
(;W[me]C[[EV\] Again this feels just a little soft.  How about pressing more severely against the top stone?  B cannot afford to cut, so I think W gets a  better result than in the game.]
;B[kc]
(;W[oc]C[proper shape? maybe p18?

[EV\] This move takes some corner territory, but I think it is more important to stay ahead in the center and to keep up the attack on the side.  B cannot take the corner without weakening his other stones, so taking the corner is not urgent for W.]
;B[nd];W[of];B[og];W[qf];B[qg];W[rf]CR[nj][pj]C[[EV\] W has secured the corner, but at the expense of greatly reducing the effectiveness of the two marked W stones.]
;B[ob];W[mf];B[rj];W[ri]C[Let B connect, to take sente?

[EV\] It is better to keep B disconnected if you can.  Pressing B into a low position is not very satisfying in this position, since W does not make much center thickness.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[rk];W[rh];B[rg];W[sg]
(;B[mg];W[nm]C[at that stage I thought that W had a positional advantage

[EV\] W has a local advantage on the right side of the board, but that is natural since B has two extra stones on the left side of the board.  I do not see any really severe attack on B, so I think the game is still even.]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[oi];W[pk];B[nn];W[mn]C[maybe just N7?

[EV\] This move is natural.  Letting B push out through the W enclosure would be bad.]
;B[mm];W[ml];B[lm];W[om];B[on];W[mo];B[sh];W[si]C[B should be alive at right side due to T10-sente-move
Though B is completely encircled W's group (P9) is not that much stronger than B's one (P13)

[EV\] The N13 group is still pretty weak.];B[lj]C[[EV\] This move seems a little too aggressive.  B is still weaker here than W, and this stone could easily end up as dame.  The W response is forced and good; I am not sure B wants to induce the following sequence.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[kl];B[jm]
(;W[kj]C[[EV\] It is better shape to push once more in sente.  B cannot allow a double hane, so W gets to build up extra strength to attack the center.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[kp]C[B encircles a nice area in lower left side.

[EV\] I do not think B has time for this.  The center group needs to escape.]

(;W[mq]C[to defend against P3

[EV\] Too slow.  Giving B this exchange in sente is too good.]
;B[pm]C[Really needed?];W[li]C[Solid, but severe enough?

[EV\] No, W should attack the entire group, not cut off a single stone.  See previous variation.]
;B[lh];W[ki];B[kf];W[kh];B[kg];W[qc]C[Q18 just better, and bigger...
But I think that I misread, and W is still alive after tenuki

[EV\] Yes, Q18 is much larger and perfectly safe.  Letting B take R17 in sente would be bad, even if W could live.  Comments end here.]
