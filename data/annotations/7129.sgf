C[yoyoma: The opening didn't feal so comfortable to me, 6-4 opening point confused me maybe.  Also there are some questions about other key points in game.  Thanks for looking.

forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for supplying an interesting game.  I have added various comments and variations.  I hope that you can understand them and that they are helpful.

Overall I thought that both White and Black fought hard and brought a lot of energy to the game.  In the early going, White made a mistake in the upper side that determined the course of the game.  Black and White ran out into the center of the board with large-scale fighting.  Both players seemed to like to play forcing moves - especially peeping at gaps in walls.  This is seldom a good idea and this game was no exception.  A lot of exciting back and forth fighting occurred until White failed to foresee a Black placement that attacked White's eye shape.  This lead to a rapid conclusion to the game although actually White missed a big chance to survive Black's play.  I hope White is not too upset to discover that the stones were not dead after all. :-)

From the notes included in the game, White seems to have a habit of finding the good side of whatever position occurs.  This leads to overconfidence.  That is not a good thing when it comes to improving.  If we do not even realize that we have a bad position, it is difficult to learn to do better! :-)]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[do];W[qp];B[op]
(;W[dq]C[yoyoma - perhaps entering now isn't good, pincer at N3 maybe better?

ff - D3 is certainly one normal play.  Let's take look at some alternatives...]
;B[eq];W[er];B[ep]
(;W[fq]C[ff - This is by far the most common play, considering the corner in isolation.  However, if we add in the situation in the lower right, I think it is also possible to consider playing F2 here, see the variation...]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[fr];W[ds];B[gq];W[cf]C[yoyoma - I decided instead of adding B5, I will enclose this corner so that black's forcing moves in the lower left are not as useful.  Also, there is a ladder on F3, but I just assumed I could wait and a chance to use it would come up later.

ff - In professional games, White plays elsewhere more than 90% of the time.  B5 is *not* the standard joseki.  Your thinking is correct.]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[yoyoma - Two shimaris face each other so I played here.  Maybe it should be 3rd line?  Or maybe I should do something on the right?

ff - This seems reasonable to me.  This is the largest area of interest.  If White has to play along the right instead then the approach in the bottom left must be wrong.  Naturally we can expect that Black will push White down in the bottom right.  Therefore, the high play here instead of K17 looks good.  It tries to maintain balance across the board.]
;B[lc]
(;W[di]C[yoyoma - maybe I should make some exchanges like wM15 and wL17 first?

ff - The play at D11 is not a good idea.  White correctly worries about Black's thickness at the bottom but what this actually means is that the left side is not an interesting place to play.  I think it is the right time to play in the bottom right.  See the variation...

Meanwhile, at the top the question is who plays next: White at L15 or M15, or Black at L15.  The problem with playing M15 followed by L17 now is that White will end in gote.  I think it is not the right time for that.]
;B[jc]C[ff - White should be happy with this idea.  If White blocks off the top, it makes sense out of the last play at D11.  Meanwhile, Black's 3-3 point at R17 will still be open.]
;W[ic];B[id]
(;W[kc];B[jb]
(;W[ib]C[ff - White sees a forcing move and plays it.  This tries too hard.  See the variation...]
;B[kb]C[ff - Suddenly Black has only a single stone in danger and White will struggle from here.]
;W[je]C[ff - Notice that the White stones are now in the shape shown for one of the variations to the previous play.  However, in that variation Black had played at L16 instead of L18 so White got sente to capture the J16 stone.]
;B[hd]C[ff - Go back again to the variations on White's J18.  Notice that if Black extends at H16, White wants to descend at L18 rather than J18.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[fc];B[hg]C[yoyoma - but actually now during the game I was happy because we will run towards the bottom, and I thought it's good to destroy his potential there.  Later I realized a drawback is I never used the aji of F3 ladder.

ff - White misjudges the situation here.  Black is the one who should be happy, not White.  The two groups of stones are running out to a part of the board dominated by Black.  The questions are: will White live, and how much territory will Black make along the way.]
;W[jg]
(;B[if]C[ff - This looks like a bad play.  White is strengthened more than Black by this exchange.  See the variation...]
;W[jf];B[hi]
(;W[ji]C[ff - This looks too conservative after the connection at K14.  White needs to be more aggressive now.  See the variation...]

(;B[hk]
(;W[jk]C[yoyoma - maybe I should have peeped and jumped one further.]

(;W[lr]C[ff - This should be the descent at N2.  See the variation.]
;B[kq]C[yoyoma - so again during game I felt pretty good.  The white wall is not strong though, the question is where to reinforce.  After the game I thought maybe it's better to make a solid connection at M7?

ff - Yes, M7 is the better shape here.]
(;W[no];B[lm];W[kl];B[mn];W[mo];B[kh];W[jh];B[qo]C[yoyoma - This move gives me a lot of trouble.  O5 is weak so I can't do much here.]
;W[ro];B[kj];W[jj];B[rn];W[po];B[qn];W[pp];B[pj];W[gj]C[yoyoma - before playing on the right I probe to see how black will play here

ff - What did you think the alternative choices for Black were?  It seems to me impossible that Black will decide to do anything but connect here.  Therefore this can not be considered a "probe" :-)  There is no clear reason to settle this now.

White faces several challenges here: 1. make territory on the left side and upper left corner, 2. limit Black's territory on the right side and upper right corner, 3. secure the center White stones, 4. limite the Black territory on the bottom and left side.  The plays on the left side now clarify the situation there and strengthen Black to some extent.  This makes it easier for Black to play on the left side.]
;B[hj];W[hh];B[gh];W[ih];B[gi]C[yoyoma - now I have a cut at G13 in case of emergency

ff - The exchange of G10 for H11 makes Black stronger...]
(;W[qh]
(;B[rj]C[ff - I think that White got lucky here.  This purely defensive play allows White the initiative.  See the variation...]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[ph];W[pg];B[qg];W[qf];B[rg]
;W[rf];B[qe]C[ff - This is a disaster for Black.  P12 and R13 are impossible if this is the result.]
;W[re];B[of];W[ng];B[rd];W[rh];B[nf];W[fg]C[yoyoma - and now it seems O13 stones will help my wall, so I peep here instead of cutting

ff - But now clearly White did not need H12 and would rather peep at G12.  And of course at the end of the game, White really wishes the cut were still there! :-)]
;B[gg];W[qc];B[qd];W[pl]C[yoyoma - I'm most interested in the earlier parts of the game.  Many more complicated things happened, you can comment on them if you like.  :)]
