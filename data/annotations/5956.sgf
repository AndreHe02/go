C[Comments: Andre Bergholz (2K), marked with AB.

To the reviewer: Thank you for taking the time to review this game. Although I had a fairly good start, I wasn't able to keep W from surrounding me in the midgame, primarily due to plain ignorance. Any tips to help me improve my game are very much appreciated. Thanks again.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[oc];W[mq]C[AB: First somewhat unusual move.]
;B[jp]LB[cj:a][cn:b]C[AB: Since the white "kakari" is fairly non-threatening, I would have probably ignored it and played elsewhere, for example splitting White's left at C10 or with a kakari at C6.

Any comments about this high pincer?];W[mo];B[pm]C[AB: The normal one-space move is more solid and there are reasons why it is often played and the two-space move is rarely played.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qn]C[AB: ??? (Is that a misclick?)];B[qm]LB[pn:a]
C[AB: Q6 is much better, there is no need to take any risks. Just the addition of the exchange White R6 - Black Q6 is favorable for Black.]
;W[po];B[oo];W[op];B[on];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[qr];B[rq]
C[AB: Very strange. But the result is very good for Black.]
;W[iq];B[jq]TR[jp][iq]LB[cj:a][jd:b]C[AB: This must be an internet game, right? A prime example of the so called internet-style. This move is completely unnecessary. Not every move has to initiate a fight. There are much calmer and better moves available right now.
Look at it this way: Suppose the three marked stones (J3, K3, and K4) are not there and it is your turn. You play K4. That would be not a very good move, because it is too close to White's thickness on the right. So White should punish you by attacking and making territory at the same time by playing from the left, say G2 or G3. Favorable for White. Instead, White plays J3. Very bad, missed opportunity. Suddenly, the exchange Black K4 - White J3 is favorable for Black, because K4 is now kikashi and White answered low. Favorable exchange, no need to add any further stones. Instead, it is the ideal moment to split the White framework at C10 or to expand your own at K16 (even better, me thinks).]
;W[ip]C[AB: It is only White who can gain now, because he is much stronger in that region.]
;B[jo];W[io]
(;B[jn]C[AB: No need to give any alternative sequences here, of course you are in trouble. The reason is that you started a fight in a region where your opponent is strong. Imagine yourself alone in the Bronx around midnight. Would you 
a) get out as fast as you can, or 
b) pick up a fight with the next best person on the street?]
;W[fq]LB[hm:a]C[AB: Slack. Should be at H7.];B[fc]LB[mn:a]C[AB: On the left-hand side I still think that splitting in the middle is best. However, here there was only one appropriate move, namely connecting your four lower-middle stones with N6. Just imagine a White move at N7 and these stones will be in big trouble. Furthermore, you can build significant influence by connecting, the game would be clearly favorable for Black.

At a second glance, I believe an approach to the left side would've been better than this corner approach]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[df]
(;B[jd]C[AB: There is a standard joseki starting with J16 (see variation).

Again, a high pincer];W[he];B[fg];W[jb];B[ic]C[AB: Cutting is a little premature.

L17 seems better with a second look];W[ib];B[hd];W[gd];B[id]
;W[fd]
(;B[ec]C[AB: Seems risky, the following sequence is completely arbitrary and predictable neither for you nor your opponent, which means that the outcome of this game completely depends on chance. See variation for a more predictable outcome.]
;W[ed];B[gc];W[hb];B[dc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb];W[ea];B[eb]
;W[fa];B[da];W[gb];B[cd]C[AB: No, White will answer at A18 leading to Black's immediate collapse.

G15 should come first, right?];W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf]

(;B[cg];W[ge];B[bg];W[fb]C[AB: Painful. Lesson: You were in the position to attack, but one does not attack using contact play. Quite the opposite: Contact play is for defending.]
;B[dk]
(;W[dg]C[AB: Unnecessary. A good moment to evaluate the game. White has 25 points in the upper left, 15 in the lower left and a little over 5 at the bottom right for a total of roughly 45 points. Black has 10 in the upper right and close to 15 in the lower right for a total of 25. On the plus side there is the big influence on the right, which must be turned into at least 20 points (seems easily possible). Black has however still several weak groups, in particular the J16 stones (just imagine the E17 stones gone and you see what I mean). So now is the time for White to reduce Black's framework while attacking stones, see variation for an example.]
;B[dh];W[eh];B[eg];W[de]
(;B[ch];W[cm]C[AB: Not sure about this move as the corner is still not 100% White.]
;B[ck]LB[fi:a]C[AB: Capturing at F11 seems big.];W[ei];B[fj]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[gi];B[fi]LB[jf:a]C[AB: Another useless fight. The three Black stones up there should simply be given up. I don't think they can be saved, but even if they can the price tag will be way too high. Just give them up by playing K14 and the game will still be good for you.]
;W[fh];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[if];B[ig];W[jf]C[AB: Look at the board right now. White now gets what he desperately wants for free. The White group is alive and sticking out its head, walking into the direction of your moyo, soon to be ex-moyo. On its way, the White group is going to kill either the Black J16 group or the H13 group. This cannot be good for Black. You might be able to save H13 and kill the G12 group (of course you will lose J16 in this case, but that might be acceptable), but ultimately you should have given up the F13 group while it was still small. Now it gets bigger and a serious burden.]
;B[lc]C[AB: L17 is better.];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[ke];W[mc];B[le]
;W[md]C[AB: It gets worse. The two weak groups still don't look any better, but White has managed to get some points on the upper side, and the Black moyo is also vanishing thanks to the White N16 stone. It becomes more and more difficult for you now to surround something on the right. For White it is good enough to turn the right into a neutral area as White already has enough points to win.]

(;B[jg];W[kf];B[lf];W[kg];B[jj]C[AB: Optimistic.];W[hj]
(;B[fk]C[AB: Saving the two stones was not so important.

I think J9 would've given me a better result here]
(;W[ik]C[AB: K11 instead?];B[ij];W[hl];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[km]
;B[jm];W[il];B[ll];W[lm];B[mm];W[ln];B[hn]C[AB: Kind of ironic that the stones at the bottom just die en passant. It would now be better to extend from your living stones on the right in sente towards the dead stones. Although, your move might not be bad if you manage to separate White as well, a seki is perhaps possible.


Desperate move?]
(;W[gm];B[gn];W[fm];B[dm];W[en];B[cn]C[AB: That is at least something, but of course you made your dead group larger, so White is happy as well. But at least your left hand side group is now 100% alive, which was not the case beforehand.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[dn];B[cl];W[em];B[dl];W[ci];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj]
;W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[db]C[AB: Very lucky. But does indeed dramatically change things as the White group in the middle is now in serious danger. So the real benefit of this seki is in the middle.

I kinda' liked this, gave me the opportunity for Seki];W[ab]

C[AB: Now it's White who gets desparate and starts silly things...]
;B[ji];W[kh];B[jh];W[mg];B[lg];W[lh];B[mf];W[nf];B[ne];W[nh]
;B[me];W[of];B[oe];W[nb]C[AB: Greedy.];B[ob]LB[qf:a]C[AB: Maybe the opportunity to rob some of White's space with R14 for example.]

;W[pf];B[rd];W[rg];B[rh];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj];B[qj];W[qh];B[pi]
;W[oj]C[AB: Harakiri. Q12 was the only move here.];B[ph];W[qg]
;B[ri];W[sf]
(;B[rb]C[AB: No, the corner is at least a seki, which means it is alive. Actually, I don't even see how White can make a seki. You answer T16 with S17.

Move played out of panic, was it necesarry?];W[lj];B[kk];W[ok]
;B[pl];W[nm]C[AB: Well...];B[nl];W[ol];B[om];W[nn];B[oi];W[nj]
;B[ni];W[mi];B[ki];W[ac];B[ad];W[rr];B[qo]C[Bah, a chance to make a humongous Seki and I blew it =<]
;W[sq];B[sp]C[A second chance, and I blew it];W[sr];B[mk]C[I stopped W from making a fake eye <_<]
;W[mj]C[AB: With P13 now it looks like a seki.];B[li];W[oh]
C[AB: Even if the middle is a seki the game is obviously clearly won by White. White only got into trouble, because of the seki in the upper left. For you, the advice is simple. Just don't fight all the time. Go is not an ego trip. When your position is strong then you are interested in a fight. When your position is weak then you are interested in compromise. If you and your opponent fight everywhere, the outcome of the game is decided by chance. If you fight everywhere and your opponent knows when to fight and when to avoid a fight, he will win. You might want to play games in real life and games with longer time limits. Ok, I hope you find this review helpful, if you have any further questions, don't hesitiate to contact me at bergholz@gmail.com.






W + Resignation

But, if P13 had really been played would Seki be the result?

Again, any comments throughout the game would be very much appreciated. Thanks ditto =)]
