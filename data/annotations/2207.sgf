C[I played white in this game.];B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[nd];B[qf];W[jc]C[Was this a good exchange for white?
I don`t think this result is good for white, your prospects on upper side are not well, while both black formations have plenty of space to extend on the left and right sides, and he has sente too.
maybe you should try something else in place of o17, maybe somewhere around d10 which  works fine with d3, and is also a very good point for black .]
;B[co];W[fp];B[cl];W[gc]C[Is this too small?
yes, it is for this stage of the game, you should go on the wider area on the right, again around r10 if you want teritory or on the fourth line if you want to gain some influence , A move like this it will limit the development of black group on upper right, and works fine with q4 stone]

;B[cb];W[qp];B[on]TR[ko][kp][jq][lq]SQ[on]C[This excange is favourable for black I think, it`s true you take some points in cornner but you don`t use the weakness of the marked black group.
The square marked stone is too good for black to let him have, it builds his right moyo and helps his weak group.
P6 should be your move.];W[cq]C[too slow and too small , you should go to n6 to keep black weak group under pressure and not let him connect. this way, while you chasing black group into center you can build some influence to support an future invasion on the right side]
;B[ln]TR[gc][jc][nd][de][ch][dk]SQ[nf]CR[qf][pj][ln][on]C[now black is safe and let look toghether at the future prospects,where is big for white and for black?
A move around o14 would be perfect for you and for black too, because is on the line between teritories who put here first increase his posible moyo in center and at the same time diminuated the opponent`s moyo, and that is a must for white]
;W[ge];B[ne]LB[me:1][mf:3][nf:2]C[this move I don`t think is good for black  has some aji I think is better at p14, white should play the hane at n15, then black p14, and white n14, and the game will be better for white I think]
;W[nb]TR[nb]C[this move also is slow and have only defense purpose, and helps black to eliminate his aji in the cornner, at least you should go at p18. If black q18, then you have p16 atari and cut o15 stone]
;B[ob];W[ck]C[this is too defensive again, it`s time for the hane at n15 to increase your moyo while black moyo  is diminuated]
;B[me];W[md];B[mj]C[that`s too defensive for black I think, I think he can push one more at m15, and then k10 or 0 10 is better]

;W[fe]TR[oa][fb][ad][od][le][bk][ro][bp]C[Looking back now, I am not sure why I made this move.
Yes no points for you there, a lot of good moves for you, and depends on the way black responds to the move at p 16 maybe you should consider an invasion in his cornner or an reduction of his moyo, because he has some bad aji  there]

;B[op];W[oq];B[ks];W[is];B[lr];W[np];B[oo];W[qi]C[I thought I was behind at this point.  Looking back now, the game is very close.
Not so close, black has enough points to win the game. you cannot make his teritory smaller but he can diminuaiting yours a lot.
And also is no hope for you to make life there.];B[qj];W[ri]

;B[io];W[ms];B[ls];W[mq];B[cp];W[bq]C[ One advice in the end:
First of all you make too many moves with defensive purpose only . And  this way you let your opponent to take the initiative(sente)

You should try to keep initiative how much you can.])
