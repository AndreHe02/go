C[DR: Dear reviewer,
Although I think I played better  than my opponent through  most of the game, I lost this game but  it was close.
I know I played a stange opening, but I  like it and I think it confuses my  opponents and this is a good example.
Still, the fact I lost the game means I  played bad at some stages.
Can you, please, point to some bad  moves or plans or general weakneses  of mine?
Thank you in advance for your time  and for your effort!];B[qf]

[qd:g][dc:h]C[DR: this is my strange opening!
By playng 2 stones at the 6-3 point  and a third one away from the corner I  invite my opponents to invade the  corner at points like the ones marked.
I will put some variations to show how  I usually handle such invasions.

ug: This opening is all right, I think. I would not play this way myself, but it is
just a matter of taste, and if you like the double approach moves, why not.]

C[ug: white is shut in, but he gets quite a lot of territory, especially if he can play at E18
at some time.];W[pd];B[nc]C[ug: A move at O16 might have a better relation to the stones on the left.]
;W[oe];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[qh]C[ug: white should play at N16 (or N15) instead. That way, blacks wall on the left would suffer.
Furthermore, this move is a bit strange since it leaves a hole
at O13.];B[bf];W[bg];B[bh];W[be];B[ch];W[af]C[ug: The stone at C10 is a bit too close to the C12 group now.]
;B[pg]C[ug: I think it might be too early to move out with this stone. If white would spend another
move here to catch the black stone, black would be glad anyway.
A move at N15 in order to build a big moyo looks quite good as well.]
;W[oi];B[ng];W[me];B[ld];W[le];B[kd];W[lg];B[mh];W[ki];B[mj]
;W[ok];B[ml];W[nk]C[DR: during the game, I thought this  move was weak and I still think so! It  helps more black than white

ug: maybe - I think the main point is that the black group, which was rather weak at
the beginning, is becoming stronger because there is a splitting attack now. Maybe
white should have treated the stone at R12 more lightly.];B[mk]
;W[on]C[ug: It might be more important to spend another move on the group at the top.]
;B[jk];W[kk];B[kl];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk];W[jq]C[DR: white left his weak group at the  mercy of black

ug: Right! Black should be happy, and I think he can attack the white group at once,
beginning with K14. White cannot afford to loose this group, so he has
to defend. Even if black cannot kill the group, He will get much stronger.]
;B[qq]C[DR: I still think this invasion is good!

ug: It is ok, if you end in sente, but I think I would have attacked the big white group
first. At this moment white has no time to defend the corner anyway.]
;W[pq]C[ug: white should consider blocking in the other direction]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm]C[DR: this was a surprize to me!]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[qm]C[DR: I felt that I had to cut. I suppose  the corner group is alive! Am I right?
  ug: The corner is alive. The question is if white can play S9 now, and capture  the black cutting stone. See the variation.]

(;W[ql];B[pm];W[rl];B[om];W[nm];B[nl]
(;W[nn]C[ug: Maybe white can play at P8? See the variation.]
;B[ol]C[DR: now white has another weak group  to take care of. I concidered this a  success for black and I started to play  rather careless.

ug: This is of course a big success for black, but on the other hand he now lost sente.
White should defend his upper group with a move like J14 now.]
;W[kn]C[ug: This gives black another opportunity to attack white's group.]

(;B[cn]C[DR: Now, after the game, I concider  this move a big mistake. A similar  move at the fourth line would be much  better. What do you think?

ug: As I said, I would first try to attack white's group at the top. If you want to approach,
a move at D6 might be better, but one should also consider a move at F3, I think.]
;W[en];B[bp]C[DR: I doubt about this. I think it is  weak.

ug: white's move at E6 looks quite good in this situation. The usual optine for
black are C3 and D8. Both of them are not satisfying for black - after C3 white gets a wall
and thus a nice moyo, and after D8 black looks overconcentrated.]
;W[cq];B[hn]LB[dl:a][ek:b]C[DR: I think this is weak too. A move  like the ones marked was propably  better.

ug: Again I would prefer to attack the white group! In answer to a or b, white would play
at J14 or so.];W[hm];B[im];W[in];B[gm];W[ho]LB[jm:a]C[DR: I was more afraid of white "a"  threatening to cut.

ug: true];B[hl];W[km];B[lk];W[go];B[rg];W[rh];B[pk];W[ni];B[mi]
;W[pl];B[pi];W[pj];B[ph];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[jf]C[ug: Finally! White should not have allowed this.]

C[ug: E9 instead might be more solid.];W[ek]C[DR: the result of leting this area free!

ug: No! With E9 instead of F9 there would have been no problem, I think.]
;B[dl];W[gk];B[kj]LB[gi:a]C[DR: propably the bogest mistake in the  game! Playing at "a" first to spoil  whites eye shape and then make this  move which ensures the life of my  group was definetly better.
Am I right?

ug: Absolutely right! Playing at a is a must.];W[kh];B[ji];W[gi]
LB[fi:a]C[And now I suddenly realise that I  cannot play at "a", so I have to let  white live!]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[bq];W[br];B[jn];W[io];B[jm];W[jo];B[cp];W[dq]
;B[ar]LB[db:a]C[DR: this mistake propably loses the  game! "a" was much biger and sente!
I was planning to play it next, but now  was the time!

ug: right];W[eb];B[fb];W[ec];B[cr];W[dr];B[ea];W[da];B[fa];W[cb]

Can you advice something better?

ug: Maybe O17 instead of O16 could be considered. Black could
also play O10 or R10.
With black O16, the position indeed looks strange, as can be seen by a tewari analysis:
If black plays first at O16 and white invades at R17, black would never respond at R14!]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nb];B[mc];W[re]C[ug: I think black could play tenuki now, for example at R6. Another possibility is
to play at P14, which is thick.];B[rf];W[qe];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe]
