C[Hi, my name is Oskar Latvaniemi and i've played go for bout a weak serious that's around 14matches and before that about 6matches during 6months. I would enjoy a review from the game and corrections for my mistakes and how i would play instead.

Thanks for the help


Ps. This game was played 02:30 during nightime so i was really tired lots of mistakes because of that.]
;B[qp];W[dc];B[dq];W[pd];B[nc]C[I usually play in other places, usually at P3 or Q10, altought there is nothing wrong about this move.]
;W[lc];B[qg]C[Now this move is a bit complicated, because you are ignoring the pincer, the usual play would be O15 separating the white stones while running to the middle.]
;W[oe];B[me];W[og];B[nf]C[This peep allows white to gain Strength to attack R13]
;W[of];B[ng];W[pb]C[While this move made a base for white, other possibilities to make your life worse would be P12, R12. Trapping the lonely black stone.]
;B[pi]C[Good move];W[oh];B[ni];W[qf];B[rf];W[qe];B[re];W[rd]
;B[ic]C[This move is a bit low for my taste, altough it puts some pressure at the M17 stone, white can cut you with N16 and O15, see variation...]

(;W[nb];B[mb];W[oc];B[mc];W[ne];B[md];W[se];B[rg];W[gc];B[sf]
;W[sd];B[qc];W[rc];B[he]C[Nice move, making a framework with the N wall, so far black is ahead, altough there is still some aji around P12.]
;W[cf]
(;B[dh]C[At this point my main strategy was to use the strength from the wall on the N and O line to grab a big piece of the center and use a sente later in the game to take som bigpoints in the lower part of the board.

You could have tried E15 to see how white reacts, because it already ignored H15.]
;W[ff];B[fe];W[ee]
(;B[df]C[My stone placement in this corner was really bad but dunno how i should play instead.

F16 looks better.];W[de];B[ce]LB[cg:A][dg:B]C[Mistake should've played A or B instead i think.

A looks like a good option and sente.];W[dg]C[Another mistake]

(;B[fc]LB[ge:E][ke:A][hh:B][dl:C][jp:D]C[Another big mistake that lost me the corner, maybe i shold've played for bigger points or aiming for a connect to my wall.

Is A,B,C,D,E anygood moves instead of F17 ?

B would make a nice moyo,  but you could always try something like this.]
;W[fd]C[This was a mistake];B[ge];W[fb];B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[eg]
;B[hg];W[eh];B[ei];W[di]LB[kg:B][bi:A][ql:E][em:C][jp:D]C[Should i play A or somewhere around the B,C,D,E area?

My feel is that the B area is rather safe so maybe to passive to play a stone there at this moment?

A move around B would make nice territory, E and D are also playable.]

Its still possible to live in the side.
