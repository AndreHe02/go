C[Hello --- my name is Mark Schlatter, and I will reviewing this game for the go teaching ladder.  I can be found as mschlat at KGS and DGS.  

Much of what I know about go I've learned from shygost on KGS, and I may be repeating some of his suggestions here.  If you have any questions about the review, please contact me at mschlat@gmail.com.  I would be happy to expend upon any comments or suggestions.]

;W[dd];B[oc];W[po];B[pp]LB[oo:C][qo:B][np:A]C[When I first looked at this move, I was sure it was not joseki.  However, Kogo's has it as joseki.  It's not something I would play (I prefer A, B, or C or a pinch), as your stones are fairly concentrated.]
;W[qo];B[oo];W[on];B[no]C[Joseki so far...];W[nn]C[White breaks joseki....]
(;B[qj]LB[qk:C][pm:A][qm:B]C[... and we have your move.  

I am wondering if a closer move would benefit you more.  (Say, any of the lettered moves.)  You gain sente on white (he needs to protect the cut), while you can gain a base.  See the variations.]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[pk]
(;B[rk]LB[oj:A]C[This is far too early to make a play on the second line.  The points you potentially take away from white are small compared to what else is available on the board.

I'm not saying this can't be a good move if white is boxed in (see the variation), but here white can run to the bottom right corner or out to the center.  This attack does not do much to change the safety of white's group.

Compare this move to A (see the variation).]
(;W[rl];B[ql]C[And this move does not help.  I'm guessing you were thinking about the cut at Q6, but white need only move at S10 (which he does) to make his shape safe.]

C[I don't see much hope for these stones.  

More importantly, you are focusing all of your attention on a small area of the board.  There are large moves (all labelled) that are larger than this battle.  Especially in the early game, you want to make moves that will give you a presence around the board.  Think corners first, then sides.]

;W[qq];B[qr];W[rr];B[sr];W[sq];B[rs]C[Look over the last 15 moves --- you are placing stones (I believe) with the intention of killing white.  However, white has easy moves to escape to the center.  Moreover, the area of contention is fairly small --- nothing compared to some of the bigger moves shown earlier.

Note what happens as a result of the fight.  White's group is now clearly safe and has taken the corner.  Your stones in the bottom right are now short on liberties and urgently need an extension.

The lesson here is to avoid fights early on over small territories.  If you can force your opponent to live small, you're good.]
;W[ss];B[pr];W[qs];B[ps];W[so];B[rn]C[The only reason I can see to make this move is for aji later on or because you believe you can win a ko fight at T4.  But there are no ko threats in the early game.  Again, look away from the local area and look to larger moves.]
(;W[sp];B[rs];W[sr];B[pn];W[pm];B[jc]C[Good move!];W[hc];B[cf]
LB[oj:A][mo:B][kq:C]C[While I like the idea here, I feel as if you owe a move or two.  A shores up the (relatively) weak stones on the side, while B (or maybe C) helps secure the bottom.]
;W[df]
(;B[cd]LB[dg:A]C[Not joseki -- it's too easy for white to separate the black stones.  (See variation.)

The typical followup is A.]
(;W[de];B[ce]C[Good move --- white is giving up the side!];W[cc]
;B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[ca];B[dh]C[I'm uncomfortable with this jump --- I'd rather see a simple hane at D13.  We'll see the ramifications of this a few moves further.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[eh];B[cn]C[Now I think you reallly owe a move at D11 --- white's later attack at D11 restricts your growth and isolates the black stones below.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[ai]LB[ah:A][bh:B]C[The problem with the straight descent is that it gives you a weakness you later need to protect.  I think you are better off with A or B.]
;W[aj];B[bg];W[ck];B[fq];W[ek];B[cq]C[Great move --- you get another corner!]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp]C[I'm used to F2 here, but this looks okay (and works well with the stones on the right.]

;W[hf];B[ie];W[he];B[id];W[hd]
(;B[ji];W[hh];B[jh]C[It looks like here you thought you overextended and then felt like you had to jump back --- probably better just to do the one space jump in the first place.]
;W[hj];B[jp];W[oj]
(;B[pi]C[Let's discuss some options here.  White has moved on one of your weaknesses and you have protected, making a poor empty triangle shape.  However, you can sacrifice these stones (or perhaps keep them) with some better options.]
;W[nj]
(;B[ni]TR[pi][ri][si][pj][qj]SQ[oi]C[When you make a move like this, you are inviting white to come in.  This is especially dangerous given the lack of liberties of the marked stones.

Compare to the variation.];W[mj];B[mi]C[Nope -- you want to close the hole at P11.  That side territory is easier to protect than the center.]

This is my last in-game comment.  Here's what I see as the major issues:

1) In the early game, focus less on local situations and focus more on the whole board.  You had much better moves than the ones you made on the lower right hand side --- moves that would establish a stronger presence across the board.  

2) Be a little more willing to hane and extend a few stones.  If you would have made a few moves at  P10 or D11 in the game, you would have gained some more stable territory.  

3) Don't be afraid to sacrifice a few stones to gain a strong wall.  You could have had the entire upper right hand corner if you sacrificed a few stones (instead of having the white group at Q16 invade).]
