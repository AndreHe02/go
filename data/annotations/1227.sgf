[oc:B]C[I'd probably play a pincer here, or A.  You seem to be using the 4-4 stone to build territory, which is kind of contrary to its purpose - 4-4's being influence moves.  Also, this move doesn't balance with B - you want to balance your 3rd and 4th line moves]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hp];W[jq];B[lq]
;W[kp];B[mp];W[on]LB[iq:A][jr:B]TR[dr][fq][hp]C[I like A for Black's next move.  If White doesn't respond (with B for example), I believe Black can connect underneath.  Also, A strengthens the triangled stones.]
;B[jr]C[I have my doubts about this move];W[kr];B[kq];W[ir]
;B[jp];W[iq];B[ko];W[ip];B[jo]TR[hp][fq][dr]LB[jr:A]C[The triangled stones have been damaged by this exchange.  I suspect A was the move that lead to the damage.]

;W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hc];W[ib];B[ic];W[jb]LB[kc:A]C[I'm not sure, but I think Black could skip out ahead to A on his next move to keep White very flat.]
;B[jc];W[kc]C[Now that White's climbed up onto the third line, it'll be much harder to kill White, and the exchange of small-territory for influence is less painful for White.]
;B[hb];W[ha];B[ga]C[This is reasonable - force White into bad shape]
;W[fa];B[eb];W[mb];B[mc];W[nb];B[nc];W[ob]C[Great - White has chosen to stay incredibly low.  This is good for Black, I believe.]
;B[pc];W[lb];B[ea]C[I think this is best left for the endgame.  White isn't going to run to the left.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[qg];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[pf];B[of];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[qf];B[oe];W[qi]LB[pj:A]C[I like A for Black here];B[pi];W[rj]

;B[ol];W[jj];B[hj]LB[gj:A][jj:B]C[I like A better.  That way if White attaches to stir up trouble, his stone at B is of less use.]
;W[hk];B[gk];W[hi];B[ik]LB[gi:A]C[I prefer A.];W[ij];B[gj];W[jg]
;B[lg]LB[fh:A]C[I think it would probably better to try to keep White separated from the left side with A.  If White wants to run toward that powerful wall, great.]
;W[gi];B[hg]LB[fi:A]C[It's getting harder to keep White separated from the left (and hence struggling for two eyes), but you might still be able to do it with A instead of this move.]
;W[ih];B[hh]C[This is eye-stealing, yes, but White won't need eyes if he can link up with his left side.]
;W[lj];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh];W[ig];B[li];W[kg];B[ji]LB[ii:A][ki:B]
C[I don't like this move very much.  Black can't cut at A on the next move, and B is an unimportant stone I think.]
;W[ii];B[kj];W[kk];B[ki]LB[mi:A]C[Not to mention this results.  Now Black has an empty triangle and a shortage of liberties - that is, White has a great forcing move at A.]
;W[lf];B[kf]TR[kh][jh][ji][ki][li][kj]C[This is of course a mistake.  Black must defend his triangled stones.]
