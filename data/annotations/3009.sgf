;B[dj];W[pn];B[np];W[mp];B[oq];W[no]C[n3 better, or is this okay? I was hoping to get outside influence by attacking black's stones in the corner.

wild : I think this is ok. black should connect, after which white should also connect at n5 (NOT n3).]
;B[op];W[mo];B[mq];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr];B[nr];W[nc]C[Should I instead protect the cut at M4?

wild : The cut at M4 is not important. white has way to deal with it. See variation.]

(;B[pc];W[jd]C[I wasn't sure about here or L17 - worried about an invasion at M17.

wild : Yes. M17 is not a priority for black now but it will remain a burden in later stages. So I would prefer L17.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[cf];W[fd];B[lp];W[ko];B[kp];W[jp]C[I misread this sequence - thought I could capture the l4 stones.]
;B[kq];W[kr]C[Maybe better to give up m2 now?

wild : Yes. See earlier variation.];B[jq];W[iq];B[jr];W[ir]
;B[jo];W[js];B[ip];W[lo];B[jp];W[hp];B[ks];W[jn];B[is];W[io]
;B[ls];W[hn]C[Black definitely gets the better of this exchange...]
;B[gs]TR[lq][lr]C[wild : white lost a lot of ground here because it tried to save two useless seeds.]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dm];B[cm];W[dk];B[ck];W[el];B[bl];W[cj];B[dl]
;W[ek];B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[di];B[ch];W[dh]C[wild : Better to just take black with e10. This move invites black's D13, which strengthens black.]
;B[dg];W[ej]C[I was quite happy with this result. Feels like the centre is strong.

wild : Yes.];B[fg]TR[ph]C[wild : At this point, I felt white had built a strong outer influence and should make full use of it. I would be very tempted to attack with Q12. It's clear black can't run to the middle coz it's effectively controlled by white. That would force it to make eyes and consequently hurt its territories on both upper and lower right. See variation.]

(;W[gh]C[wild : It is generally not a good idea to use outer influence to build territories because it is not effecient (compare corners and side).]
;B[ne];W[ld];B[qm];W[qn];B[nk];W[qh]TR[qf]SQ[pj][nk][qm]C[I spent some time thinking about this one - is it a good time to invade, and is it at the right point? Or is it better just to reduce?

wild : I think it is a liitle late. It might have been better if it is done earlier. See previous variation. As an invasion, this looks too deep. If black pincers at r14, i think there's only a small chance white can make two eyes there. Note however, that black's marked group is not strong either.

It can't run to the middle because it was too deep.

However, reducing is not an option too because that would give black too much territory. So I guess an invasion is inevitable. This point looks fine.]
;B[qf];W[qj];B[pi];W[pk];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[ok];B[qk];W[ql]
TR[nk]C[wild : Good move. Give away two useless seeds with sente to cut off marked stone.]
;B[rk];W[rl];B[sj];W[oj];B[ni];W[nj]C[wild : I would think that the oush through P11 should come first. Black must respond with P12.]
;B[oi];W[mj];B[fh]C[Seems that the invasion gave black more in the top right than white in the centre.

wild : Yes, but it's quite inevitable.];W[fi];B[li];W[mi];B[mh]
;W[nh]TR[ni][oi][pi][pj][qi][ri][sj][qk][rk]C[better at m12, I think now. this was a mistake, and I think cost quite a lot of points in the centre. I had wanted to cut off M11 and build a large area in the centre.

wild : Yes. This move does not threaten black marked group at all.]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[kg];W[ki];B[kh];W[lj];B[lg];W[ii]C[Here, I wanted to close the corner at b16, but felt that black could eat quite a way into the centre if I didn't protect it. I often finish with large centre areas, mostly by accident, then spend moves worrying about protecting it. So should I have protected the corner instead, and taken less in the centre?

wild : Yes, the corner is bigger.];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd]
(;W[be]C[wild : Wrong direction. White should protect its top territory. This direction is favoured only when there are subsequent moves on the left side. Here there isn't any. See variation.]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[bg]C[Probably an overplay? Was trying to cut off the f13 group.

wild : Not really, but white gave away too many at the corner in return for small invasion on the left side.]
;B[bh];W[cg];B[bf]C[wild : Probabl better to play E13, then followed by E14 (compared to D14 first and followed by E13).]
;W[df];B[ag];W[eg];B[if];W[hf]TR[hd]C[wild : This is forcing it too much. It will hurt white's top side. Better to play H16 to protect top. Note that black is not fully connected yet. So it will need another move here to connect. That will give white sente to play elsewhere.]
;B[ie]C[wild : Expected. White should protect top.];W[id];B[he]
;W[gf];B[cg];W[ef];B[gc]C[wild : Try estimating white's gain in getting two marked stones and white's loss in invasion of the top as a result. Which is more?]

;W[le];B[kf];W[lb];B[ji];W[jh]C[wild : Misktake I suppose. Should be from inside.]
;B[jg];W[ig];B[ih];W[jj];B[hg];W[if]TR[rp][hh][ob][er]C[wild : This is really small. Should consider other bigger plays (marked points).]
;B[jh];W[hh];B[nd];W[rp];B[qq]

(;W[ep]TR[ob]C[wild : This is small. During endgame, we should always be extra careful about our moves. Always ask ourselves, does opponent's last move threathen us in anyway? If yes, respond accordingly. If not, look for bigger plays like P18. See variation why it is big.]
;B[co];W[cp];B[bn];W[rq]TR[bo]C[wild : Yes, this is bigger than protecting white's marked stone.]
;B[rr];W[mc]C[wild : No hurry to take this black seed.];B[mf]
;W[qp];B[qr];W[bp]TR[ob]C[wild : P18 is still bigger.];B[ob]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[me]C[This was pointless! I'd thought it was a threat to play at o14, but missed o13 as an obvious response!

wild : Yes.];B[sl];W[rm];B[sm];W[sn];B[sk];W[an]TR[sr]C[wild : I think T2 is the biggest endgame move from this point onwards. In summary, please take note of the following points:

(a) Sacrifice when necessary.
(b) Strong outer influence is generally best used to attack opponents weak groups, not to gain territory.
(c) During endgame, consiously look out for the bigger endgame moves. Of particular importance are those which result in sente. Professionals generally value endgames moves that result in sente twice as much as those that result in honte.

This shall be my last comment as the remaining of the game are straightforward. I wish you all the best in your future games. Most important of all, enjoy playing it. "It's a beautiful game."]
