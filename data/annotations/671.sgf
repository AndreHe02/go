;B[pn];W[nm];B[jd]C[This move makes the b corner enclosure in the  upper right happy, but leaves the b stone on the bottom in dire shape. B  could easily play off somewhere like j3 before playing k16. This would  give the m3 stone a better chance.]
;W[jp];B[fc];W[df];B[dc];W[pr]C[This  is a small move by white. Taking something like g3 or c7 puts additional  pressure on b by securing big territory for w.]
;B[qq];W[ok];B[pk];W[oj];B[pi]C[This sequence isn't bad for w, as it gives a  nice wall for influence to the center.]

(;W[nh]C[But this is a bit much.];B[dl]C[This b invasion is nicely  timed, but imagine if the sequence if 23 (b q11) had been followed by  24 at w c7. The influence in w's favor would be  immense.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[fp];B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[The wrong direction for w.];B[cr];W[dr];B[bo];W[do]
C[White  makes a decision to give up the corner and side for territory on the  bottom.]
;B[bn];W[en];B[dm];W[em]C[But fails to capitalize by playing too  closely to b. A looser move to, say, g7 would be more appropriate to w  strategy.]
;B[el];W[fl]
(;B[cm]C[This move is rather slack by b. c5 would accomplish the same  effect and guarantee the capture of the stone.]
;W[fk];B[jm]C[B realizes  w's strategy];W[lp]C[w is unduely concerned with this stone. It would be  better if b ran up with it to try and connect as then w's wall to the  right would come into play.

Additionally, a capping move at m5 would help against the k7  stone.]
;B[hl]C[A nice, light move by b.]
(;W[hk]C[w is trying too many things at once here. Better to extend from  the strength of the wall to the right.

This really seems to be the big turning point of the game. If w plays  something like m8 or m9 instead of h9, the character of the game changes  dramatically.]
;B[ll];W[jk]C[Having built this wall, w needs a parallel  one along the top to turn it into territory.]
;B[nl];W[ol]C[But this  petty bickering distracts w.];B[kk]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[mk];B[jj]C[b chooses  well, to connect upward and eat into w territory.]
;W[ij]C[This could be at j8. W could then cut the b stone at j7 or h7  and salvage something from this poor  fight.]
;B[jl];W[ik];B[ji];W[ii]C[Another move too close to b. W should  worry more there about b forming eyes and connecting. W's groups around  the b stones are stable so if b cannot form eyes, it doesn't matter how  many liberties b has.]
;B[jh];W[fe]C[W finally begins to try and make  territory.]
;B[ih]C[If b plays k14 here, the game is won.];W[pg]C[A move  to about g12 is bigger for w.]
;B[qh];W[jf]C[An admirable try to cut off the b middle group and kill it. But  b has too many places to run to.]
;B[if];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[mc];W[ld]C[A  good try at cutting off one avenue of escape for  b.]
;B[lc];W[hd];B[hc]C[The second route is cut off. B should likely play  at j16 instead so that the center stones connect to the upper right.]
;W[id]C[W j15 is better.];B[kd]C[B is still in trouble. k15 would allow  connection]
;W[hh]C[W proceeds in the wrong direction.  L14 or j15 allows  the attack on b to proceed.]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[ed];W[ee];B[cd];W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[cj];W[ci]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[ck];W[pd];B[od];W[oe];B[pc]C[No good  reason not to take q15 instead.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[rf];W[lh];B[gl];W[gm];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn]
;W[hp];B[mm];W[nn];B[ko];W[kp];B[io];W[ip];B[lo]C[w loses big  territory]
;W[ml]C[w can take this or p7 to connect top to bottom. Better  that points like j17 or k15 that put pressure on b be chosen.]
;B[mn];W[ki];B[kj]C[w begins an attack on the b center group. But b can  connect to the top unless w plays there first. So it is better that w  had started this  earlier.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[ho];B[pl];W[im];B[kh];W[li];B[kf]C[And so, b  connects.]
;W[lf];B[kg];W[ke];B[je];W[le];B[ic];W[ie];B[hf];W[gf];B[gd]
;W[ge]C[A blunder by w pays off for  b];B[he];W[in];B[il];W[io]
;B[gk];W[fj]C[And a second];B[hi]C[Has its  reward];W[gi];B[hj]
C[W can resign at this point. There is little hope of  gaining territory equal to b's large top and right.

So b has profited by w mistakes and w's inability to successfully attack  the center group. W's game of seeking influence in the center has failed  due to this. Hopefully, b can see where some mis-plays by w allowed an  easy win. If the stones in the center had died, or had lived with much  less territory, this game would be at least close and could have been a  white win.]
