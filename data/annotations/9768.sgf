C[Daniel-san: hi gg
archpaladin1: same to you

Hi, Daniel -- This is Rick Mott 5k writing your review.  You asked: "Would you please comment on how I may improve my opening? Also, I noticed as the game progressed that white was able to build significant moyos. 

Despite a successful corner invasion, I failed to reduce these, which resulted in my loss. I would appreciate comments on opportunities for reducing the opponent's moyos."

Reducing is tricky, because you are entering an area of your opponent's strength.  He will usually build influence on the outside around your invasion, and often winds up with sente.

All my comments witll have "RM" in front of them,

Just having looked at the first 30 moves or so, what jumps out at me is that you need to have a strategic purpose for your stones, and you should always look at the whole board situation and focus on moves which both expand your potential and restrict your opponent.  The sequence of making a center-facing wall in the lower right makes no sense strategically.  You can't build a big moyo, since white's strong corner is right above you.

The same sequence of moves rotated 90 degrees, i.e. played from the top against white's upper left corner, would be much better because it would have a strong relationship with your top stones.

There was a beautiful tesuji for you at move 65 that would have given you a 50-point corner plus center influence facing your lower-left wall.  Check out the variation from move 64.  (Oops... white has a way out.  But you still come off better than just giviing up your 4 stone group.)

Your last chance to win was an end-game tesuji at move 179.  Believe it or not, because of all his cutting points you could have killed White's corner group in the lower left.

This was a fun game to review.  Hope the comments are helpful!]
;B[pc]C[archpaladin1: same to you];W[dp]
(;B[pq]C[RM: Believe it or not, I would call this the first mistake.

The two black stones are too far apart.  Even if you managed to make shimaris (knight's moves) in both corners, their directions of influence would each point at an opposing corner instead of reinforcing each other.

Better to play at the start point (setting up a Chinese opening, see variation) or R4.]
;W[dd];B[qe]C[RM: If you take the shimari in either corner...]
;W[qo]C[RM: White naturally takes the vital point of the other corner.  Your first two groups are separated and can't reinforce each other very well.]
;B[mq];W[ql];B[ic];W[gc]
(;B[ci]C[RM: Maybe a little too agressive to start an invasion now.  Your J17 stone is weak; it's quire far from its friends.  I would reinforce it first (see variation).]
;W[cf];B[cl]C[RM:  I still like M16 or J15.  Your C11 stone can always run out into the center if attacked.  I'd rather consider M11 a reducing move and use this move to reinforce the upper right moyo.]
;W[cn]C[RM: But since white response locally, you've actually done better than you should have.]
;B[lc]C[RM: I think this should be on the 4th line.];W[gq]
(;B[jq]C[RM: Extending down the right side is bigger. Neither side can make much out of the bottom.  See variation.]
;W[qi]C[RM: White gets here first.  Compare this to the previous variation.  You would have a lot better position with a black stone at R12, even if white gets K3.]

(;B[em];W[en];B[fm];W[fn];B[gn]C[RM: Imagine the last three moves you played being at the top, against G17 (see variation).  Wouldn't you be a lot happier?  As you played it, you force White to reinforce the lower left corner and enlarge it, without doing yourself much good.  You can't expect to make any territory with the two-stone group on the left, but you can get a very large moyo in the top and upper rigtht corner.]
;W[go];B[hn];W[ho]
(;B[jn]C[RM:  What does this move do for you?  Both groups are strong enough.  Now that you've made the wall, you have to make it useful by playing to keep White from erasing its influence.  I like the shoulder hit at D13, or the large knight's move at F12 as possibilities.  See variations.]
;W[pf]C[RM: Huge for white.  Compare this to black Q12.]
