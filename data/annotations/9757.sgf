 pa342 9k : Hi!
 micha 10k : 148 hi

-Hi, sorry this is a little late, but here it is. I made quite a lot of variations, but i didn't mark them in the comments, but you can see them in the sgf tree. Your fuseki was good, but in the middle game you should think more about the direction of play. Also you should practice with tsumegos to make much more fighting power!

If you have questions, you can ask me in KGS, I am mr. pupukani]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[po];B[pl]C[i dont really know any joseki from here but i figured a pincer+extension cant be wrong]
;W[hp]C[i decided to jump to 33 because the bottom side looked unintresting to white and there is no stone around D10
so white has no good side to block (and i have sente after the incasion)

-Good thinking];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
;B[cn];W[fp]C[This is very honte. White could play more actively at n4 or some other move in that area to make a larger scale.]

(;W[pm]C[W s8 was joseki];B[ol];W[mn];B[pf];W[kq]C[now i think this is move is small and i probably should not respond
but in the game i was afraid that there is a placement tesuji im missing (O2 for example)

-Because of s2 your corner is safe. o2 gets captured by n2]

(;B[no]C[-Don't peep this kind of shape, maybe you can cut later. If you want to make better shape play m2 or l2, they make white even more overconcentrated.]
;W[nn];B[oo];W[on];B[jd];W[gc];B[jf]C[i think untill now the fuseki is good for B]
;W[ob]C[i wasnt sure how to handle this invasion so i decided to play "safe" let it live and profit from surrounding it

-Black wants to make profit on the right side and corner, and the top side white can live small. White has g17 already, so it is hard for black to make territory there.]

(;B[mc];W[mb];B[nd];W[nb];B[cf]C[is playing on the line between the 2 moyos around m8  better?

-Yeah i think playing the moyo is super big];W[bd];B[dj]C[C6 can be used by white to make an easy invasion top, for example c8. Or if white plays his own moyo, after that e7 makes black pretty low. C12 is also good place for white.]
;W[ch];B[ci]C[i think d12 would have been better , getting a wall that works with the black moyo
in the game i was thinking "im ahead on territory and on potential territory , i should solidify what i have"

-Never kick like this, halps white to go out. This solidifies white, but black has weakness at c8 and c9]
;W[dh];B[ef]C[Even without c11 d12 exchange this would be bad, because white can just connect under, and there is a gap between e14 and k14, which can be used to reduce blacks potential]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[fd];W[fc];B[ed];W[ec];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[de];W[dc]C[The corner is now solid, and black can't threaten it anymore. Black got some eye space in sente, but g14 would have connected while leaving aji around g17.]
;B[ll]C[But thankfully black got here first];W[jj]
(;B[lj]C[White doesn't have much more points right now, white needs to add a move. The other option would be k8, but I think this is better]
;W[kh]C[This is overplay.]
(;B[mh]C[Maybe peep first at j12 shape point to make white heavy]
;W[lg]C[J12 would be still good, halps black to connect too.]
;B[ki]C[If black wanted to cut, it would be better before m13-n12 exchange. This is also a "vulgar" cut, it gives white a better shape especially after m13 kosumi, compared to K11]

(;W[kd];B[ke];W[jg];B[ji];W[if]C[Now g14 would be better than the other stones in the upper left corner.]
;B[mf];W[ih];B[rl]C[Why tenuki? Black has to continue the fight. If white cuts now at h15 area, black is in trouble]
;W[ie];B[fh];W[di];B[cj];W[bh];B[hg];W[je];B[kf];W[ig];B[fj]

;W[nh];B[ni]
(;W[lf];B[me];W[le]C[this was painfull
i shouldnt have been so submissive

-It's mainly the tenuki that got black in this trouble. When there is a big fight for the safety of groups and moyos, its more important than endgame, even if its very big in territory.]
