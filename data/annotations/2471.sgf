RdRunner: Hi, I'm RdRunner/Excalibur on igs, you're welcome if you have any quesiton.]
;B[dq];W[pp];B[dd];W[do];B[fp];W[cq];B[dp];W[cp];B[jq];W[dr]
C[RdRunner: White should E4.  b D4 already made mistake, which tight up the liberty.  If w E4 b F5, w E4 will take care of everything.  If w E4 b C2, then w B2 D2 C6; w still has teh E4 cut, and much better shape than the game.]
;B[er];W[cr];B[cl];W[eo];B[cn];W[co];B[dh];W[fc];B[pd];W[nd]
C[RdRunner: White should C14 to see what b is going to do --- basically let b decide whether upper or right is bigger.]
;B[qf];W[jd];B[ld]C[RdRunner: Black should H17.  Force w to make move around this area and strength D16 and the right side.]
;W[jb]C[RdRunner: K17 is more solid; then W won't have lots of the worries later.]
;B[lc];W[df];B[fd];W[ec]C[RdRunner: G16.  E17 is giving up D14 too easily.  If b E17, F15 E16 G14.  This will save the D14 and expose C10 as an invasion point.  If b F15, E17 D17 E16 E15 D15 --- this is pretty complicate, the success depends on each player's fighting skill.]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[cd];W[cc];B[hd];W[gd];B[ge];W[gc];B[ff];W[bd]
C[RdRunner: B16 too early.  There is still another invasion at C10 (C12 and E10 are "mi-a-i"), and w (C10) will need the help from D14; B16 kills D14 a bit too early.]
;B[be];W[bc];B[cf];W[dj];B[em];W[bj]C[RdRunner: White overplayed.  Black has too many stones around, running out the the first thing.  If also want to cut b, E9 is the move --- but not recommended.]
;B[bl]C[RdRunner: If without B16 exchange, w C12 would easily make an eye at the right side.]
;W[fj];B[ie];W[hf];B[je];W[hc]C[RdRunner: R17 instead.  R17 also looking at L15.]
;B[oc];W[lb]C[RdRunner: What's the purpose of M18?  What does this move trying to achieve?  It doesn't live the upper side --- already alive; it doesn't threat black --- too thick.  The more ugent thing is to take care of the right side now.]
;B[mb];W[kc];B[hj];W[ke]C[RdRunner: The right side is the focus now, not upper.]
;B[le];W[lf];B[he];W[mc];B[nc];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[nb];B[ng];W[ob];B[pb]C[Question 1:
Who is leading now?

Question 2:
What is better way to treat
white group on the right side?

RdRunner: Blacking is leading.  Let's do a count.  White has three corners: upper-left: 24 pts, lower-left: 8 pts, and untouched lower-right: 10 pts; total = 44 pts.  The right side of black has at least that much already --- i didn't count the lower side and upper-right corner and the possible territory at the right side yet.  And B also has the thickness advantage as well.

The better way to treat the right group is to give up --- they are surounded by 20 black stones; hard to image that they'll be OK at all.

W's chance is at the lower side.  B still has the E4 problem.  Say, W could F6 threat to save the right group but the actual intention is to invade at H3.]
;W[ch];B[cg]C[RdRunner: What if B C11 instead?];W[bh];B[di]
;W[ci];B[dk];W[ei];B[dg];W[gk]C[RdRunner: B should E9 then J8.]
;B[hk];W[gm];B[fn];W[fo];B[gn];W[hl];B[go];W[gp];B[fq];W[ep]
;B[hp];W[eq];B[gr];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[ql]
C[RdRunner: W a little bit overplay.  Should S4 take the corner and look for chance later; if B response with Q7, hard for W to servive and not to damage somewhere else.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[pn]

thinking here];W[kr];B[qj];W[og]C[From now on, the game is
the chain of silly mistakes --
not very appropriate for comments

remarks];B[of];W[pf];B[oe]C[Didn't see atari];W[qg];B[qe];W[rg]
;B[ma];W[oh];B[nj];W[qc]C[Maybe Black didn't see following
sequence of moves];B[kd];W[pc];B[od]C[Is this white group really alive?
Or was I just lucky?

C[RdRunner: Watch closely, if B just M9 or N10 instead, with all the territory from center to right side, the game is over.]

;W[ks];B[is]C[Is black on the corner alive?

RdRunner: Black's corner is very well alive.  It's basic Life and Death problem ("Tsu-me GO").]

C[With this move, white group is now alive];W[af]C[Black resigns

RdRunner: Basically, the biggest problem i have seen is that the moves are lack of consistency --- the stones doesn't work together for a common purpose.  Also, need to pay more attention on the strength of group of stones --- invade the weak, and stay away form the strong.  This will safe you from been double- even triple-play.]
