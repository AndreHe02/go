Hello,
The following is a game I played as white with a 3d player on MSN.  I would
like to get some analysis and comments.  The black requested to resign after
84.  So it bothers me that the game seemingly did not finish while w (?) was
winning.  Currently, I have not been ranked. Hope that high Dans could give
more insights and comments, and to evaluate my strength.
Truly,
Jay Wang

I could'nt judge your rank, for the strength of a rank is different in each country.]

w14 is a mistake, E16 is joseki (standard position).

Is w in a clear better shape?  It seems that the b's only option
is to block (say K11) and let w upper group live by b playing S14.  At this
point, b will have to protect upper b dragons (say b K10), while w would
invade lower right corner (w P3).  It also seems that w had equal territory
as b, and is in better attacking shape.
Thank you for taking time to help, and looking forward to hearing from you.
Truly,
