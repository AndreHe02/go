LB[pl:A]TR[pj][om]C[here black  can try to attack the white stone. if black  had seperated the marked white stones before black would have really good chances in the coming fight.

but I think attacking is not good. Black leads. you chose to play camly which is very good.

Also A might be a good point. while you threaten to seperate white you can enlarge the lower left corner.]

One way to handle that is to placea stone that will make the ladder works for black.
Or just save them.
