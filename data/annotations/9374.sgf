AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[This is a four stone game on KGS where I am black. My opponent is 3k and I'm 7k. Thank you in advance for the review.

Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS, I'm about 2d KGS.

I'll start my comments with W: so they can be easily distuingished from other comments.

I guess I was thinking I might be able to gain some strength from pressuring this group a bit but there's really nothing to be gained here.

Should I have played O4 earlier in order to reduce the aji here?

W: It's possible to O4 earlier, if you feel you can spend a move to defend.]

;W[kr];B[jr];W[or];B[pr];W[qr]C[I have no clue what to do about this. Should I have defended this group earlier to prevent this or can I still minimize this reduction?

Was Q2 the wrong move?

W: Not at all.]

W: White has ~ 50 points, Black has ~ 44 points, so Black should still have a fair chance to keep playing.]

Why did Black lose this game? It's because White lived in the bottom right corner. I guess you've heard this atleast hundreds of times, but it looks like you need to practice your problem solving skills. :-)

ABC's of Attack: Cut and surround
In the game you had several groups you could have surrounded or cut:

Move 26: Cut the group at the bottom left.
Move 52: Surround the group at the top.
Move 94: Cut the 0 eyed group on the right.
Move 104: Surround the group at the bottom.
Move 116: Cut the group at the top.

ABC's of Defense: Connect and get out
You handled this part pretty well.

Move 74: Connect.

Try to keep these two rules in mind. If you can find a move that combines attack and defense, don't hesitate to play it. It would surely be the best move on the board.]
)
(;B[el]LB[en:A]C[W: To cause the severest damage on White, this would probably be the move. It is not possible for White to capture this move, since there's the cut at A that will destroy White if he tries too hard. This move reduces White's territory on the left a lot.]
)
(;B[ij]C[W: Just jump.]))
(;B[qs]C[W: Of course, connecting would be the move.]))
(;B[ps];W[qq];B[pq];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo];B[po]C[W: Black is too strong in the corner. White is dead. There are dozens of different positions what could come out of it, but there's no life for White. I'll throw a couple of examples.]

(;W[qp];B[sp];W[so];B[qs];W[rs];B[rr];W[sr]C[W: looks like a ko, right?]

))
(;B[hd];W[hc];B[id]C[W: White needs to make life in gote at the top, so Black can severily attack the group on the outside.]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[ga]TR[kg][lg][kh][lh]C[W: Attacking White's group now would be a good plan.]

(;B[mm]C[W: You need to surround your opponent. When your opponent gets surrounded he needs to make eyes in gote, while you can make bigger moves elsewhere.]

(;B[se]LB[sf:B][mg:E][sg:A][nh:C][sh:D]C[W: Whatever happens, you must not let White's 0 eye group connect to the 2 eye group in the corner. You can easily settle your group with the A-E sequence in case you feel there's doubts of your group living.]

(;B[bd]LB[ch:A]C[W: White's top right corner is strong and Black's top right corner is under pressure. Defending here gives Black a base and it threatens an invasion at A.]
