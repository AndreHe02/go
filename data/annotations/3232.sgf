C[I'm still a beginner, so too deep thougths are not required ;-)
I'm interested special in comments to the begin.
Though i won with much points in the end, up to 5-10 stones before the end i thought i will lose. My opponent pushed and pushed me over the board.
So my question is: Where were my weak moves that allowed him to do so?

This game was played on IGS with 1/10.

[Hikaru79\]: Hello! I am Hikaru79, and I will be reviewing your game ^_^ I'll try to make the most helpful comments I can--this is my second review, so I should be getting a bit better ;)]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[qp];W[dc];B[co];W[pj];B[oq];W[cf];B[lc]LB[jd:A]
C[Although it is mostly a matter of taste, I prefer a move around A myself. This is because it is the ideal extension from your shimari on the left, while at the same time it is pincering the M17 stone. Dual-purpose moves like these are good.]

(;W[nc];B[jc];W[gd]C[I entered byo-yomi here.
Yun still has 39 sec. of his one minute. He thought very fast!]
;B[kp];W[cj];B[hp]
(;W[en]LB[dm:B][fq:A]C[This move does not really seem well-placed. First, it is far too deep to be a reduction, and too shallow to be an invasion. Black has spent six moves on the bottom edge--it is a framework that must be treated with caution. 

If you had wanted to invade, a move around 'a' is your best bet, although it is not very safe either. Better than invading would be a simple reduction, perhaps at 'b.' See variations.]
;B[qc]
(;W[pc]LB[qd:A]TR[nc]C[You blocked off the 3-3 invasion from the wrong side. By playing Q17 instead of A, you are not letting the marked stone do any work. See the variation for A.]

(;W[ri]LB[qj:A]TR[pj][qn]C[This is a bad move that weakens the two marked stones by pushing black towards them. See the variation for A..]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[oi];W[oh];B[pg];W[nd];B[nj];W[ph];B[ml]
(;W[ep]C[Good. Your opponent made the mistake of ignoring E6 for too long, and you have turned a bad move into a good one. However, perhaps 'A" would have been even better. See variation.]
;B[eq];W[oo]C[Your focus now should be on the two stones at E4 and E6. E4 was an important reduction, but it needs to be followed up, either by going in deeper, or connecting back to C10.]
;B[hc];W[gc]C[Good. This is a strong territorial move that strengthens your already-powerful moyo on the left.]
;B[je]
(;W[jf]LB[id:A][kd:B]C[I'm not too sure about this move. It turned out well in the game because of black's mistake. In general, a move at A or B would be best. See variations.]

(;W[mp]LB[qk:A][rk:B]TR[rj]C[You are playing a bit too loosely in black's sphere of influence. Black is very strong in the bottom right--two knight's moves aren't appropriate. They can be cut. A much better strategy right now would be to either build a base or connect to the marked stone. See variations.]
;B[mq];W[ln]SQ[qn][oo][mp]C[Again, too loose. You're setting yourself up for disaster. You need to focus on building a base for the marked stones. They are just floating at the moment.]
;B[km];W[nl];B[pk];W[qk]C[It's a bit too late for this move. Would have been nice four turns ago, but now black can just play R8 and be very happy with himself.]
;B[ql];W[rk];B[ol];W[om];B[nm];W[rl];B[mk]C[A mistake that you should capitalize on immediatly.]
;W[nn];B[mm];W[qm]C[Very good. Tanks to N9, black gave you a free turn to connect. White should be very happy now.]
;B[pl];W[pm];B[nk]

;B[mn];W[mo];B[lo]
(;W[ll]LB[hg:A]SQ[lm][ln]C[It is unlikely that the three marked stones will live. You should just ignore them and play around "A" to make sure that the four black stones stay dead.]

(;W[hb]LB[hg:A]C[You've got the right idea--it is important to make sure those four stones stay dead. But a move around A accomplishes this more efficiently, while also solidifying territory. See variation.]
;B[np];W[no];B[ro]LB[hg:A][dm:B]C[Small, and does not need to be answered. Any of the marked points are good for a next move. S6 is not neccesary.]

[rs][ss]C[Overall, I could only identify two large problems.

1) Direction of Play: When pushing your opponent, try to solidify your own weak groups when you do so. When the opponent 3-3 invades, and you have stones in the vicinity, try to block so that the black stones are pushed towards it.

2) Cuts: Watch out for them! Try to play vertically or horizontally when you can--only hane when you're sure you won't be cut!


Other than that, a good game! :) I wish you luck with the rest of your go career!]
