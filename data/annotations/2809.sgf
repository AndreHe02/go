(;W[dk]C[This move allows black to build territory and settle himself better.  At the same time your not building outer influence to any great extent due to the weakness' between D14, D9 and D6.  C10 is a better move in this area.  Have a look at the alternate move 18.]
;B[cj]C[Black builds his base and expands his territory.];W[ci]
;B[dm]C[This is the main weakness that made D9 a bad move.  D11 is now looking like a nice cut for black also.  

In all you have built no territory while allowing black to do so and at the same time introduced weakness into your forms.  Perhaps a study of good shape might help you along further understanding of this sequence.]
;W[dl];B[em]C[D8 is really a white attempt to build further strength towards the centre aka influence or thickness.  The usefulness of that thickness is completely undone by E7 and so that whole shape (D8, 9 , 10) is useless.  Plus the cut at D11 is worth more now as there are more white stones to try and capture.]
;W[cl]C[This is your only recourse and it works quite well fortunately, but black has other options that make the situation comlex.]
;B[bl];W[bk]C[*in this situation was there something better?]

(;B[bm];W[bj];B[bo];W[bp];B[en];W[do];B[ao]C[He should extend outward first.  Usual rule is build eyes only when you MUST otherwise extend outward.  Here black should therefore move outward with F5 or G6.]
;W[ap]C[White can build more by going to F4.  Get out of the habit of following your opponent around.]
;B[nq];W[fp]C[Surround in a greater sense and force them to make eyes.  F4 does that plus takes some potential profit on the side, a two for one.  

*was this ok? ignoring? i considered his b group urgent!, he didnt think so....]
;B[gn]
(;W[hp]C[I think he is correct here for ignoring you.  It will take two more moves by white to really cuz him any more trouble so H4 is not an urgent threat.  See variation.]
;B[kq]C[Whites door is open (4th line stone) so black steps into it (3rd line stone).  the follow up is H2 or G3 both of which reduce whites territory drastically.  Approaching an open dorr like this is very powerful as white needs to respond or lose a lot of points and possibily (depending on the shapes) could face a life or death battle.  Here white is fine thenkfully.]
;W[in]C[White is being to pushy.  There is much of the board left over and you d9on't want to have the game won or lost this early.  It very easy for a position to look like a kill but if you press it you get killed or take some huge loss that can't be recovered from.]
;B[el];W[fk];B[gl];W[fl];B[fm];W[hm];B[gm];W[hj];B[ek];W[fj]
C[As this goes on look how white is sparse and disconnected whitel black is one solid shape.  It is difficult to build a sparse net about such strength.  A weakness will almost certainly be found and then white takes a huge loss and black is alive making all whites stones and effort useless.]
;B[eo]
(;W[fo]C[This is a fault with your reading out the combat.  E4 was the correct move for obvious reasons.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[dq];W[cp];B[fq];W[er];B[gp];W[gq]C[If this was a consious choice to take the outside then its commendable and probably the right direction, though very costly.

If however you thought you could keep both sides of D3 then I recommend you study life and death problems a great deal.  Learn to read out situations by at least 4 moves on both sides.  It is easy to see that whites corner dies right here.]
;B[cq]C[I don't think so, not at this point at least.  Remember killing is not the object, getting territory is.  A group kill can win you the game but so can a single point.  In fact in this situation attempting to kill prematurely may lose you the game.  At this point I would say black is well ahead.  He doesn't maintain this advantage though and that is his bad luck.  One can't rely on the opponents bad play though so getting to this situation at all is very bad for white.

*it was clear to me here i lost the battle, but was there a way to kill?]
;W[qn]
(;B[pr]C[H2 is far more damaging and maintains sente for black while building territory.  So nice.]

;W[le]C[This doesn't seem like its doing very much of anything.  As a threat on N18 it forces black to reinforce his side thus sealing it further from you.  It does nothing to reduce black's area.  If it was to connect the corner to let it live then O18 would be better as it makes profit and lets that corner live.]
;B[ld];W[ke]C[Look who is making more points per move.  L15 for white is facing a single white stone and there are encroaching black groups on the sides.  Black's L16 cements the middle of the upper side very firmly.  As a connecting move its useless.  Since O18 is simple life, making a connection is pointless.]

;B[rr];W[rd]C[If your going to accept a move in gote then its best to block the one that will cost you the most points.  In this corner that would be O18 I feel.  Black can jump to Q19 and reduce that space to nothing without O18.  Alternatively Black S17 does far less damage.]

*better safe then sorry (my thoughts)

Nope, can't find a sufficient weakness there to warrant giving up 7 points.  Life and death problems teach you to read out situations with a great deal of skill.]

;W[ho];B[fn];W[fq];B[as];W[lk]C[Why?  The power of the center is that there are no edges for invaders to make eyes with.  There is no danger of not having enough eyes for this group is stretched across the board.  Play by the seat of your pants.  Trust your reading and learn from mistakes.  I think that is the best way forward.]

Also learn what strong groups are and leave them be and let black attack them all he wants.]

;B[fo]C[Black lives but white has a potent weapon...SENTE aka the next move.  At this point you must choose to "close the door" at J3 or play out from Q4.  Now take stock.

Black has...
An entrapped living shape that might be able to press out on the enclosing stones but not in an easily forseeable way.  
plus 3pts in that shape

White has...
an enclosing net around black that though looking weak at this point could prove pretty strong if attacked.  This could act as thickness and allow white options all over the board.
up to 26pts in the left corner if the "door is closed", 16pts if black extends underneath.

So even though black lived white comes out ahead!  This is the nature of GO!  Allow his something to take more.  It is a negociation for territory.  Give a little and take a little more (or a lot more as here)]
