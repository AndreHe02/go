C[In this review, I mainly just commented on individual moves. I don't claim that any of the moves that I suggest are 100% "correct"; My intent is to illustrate some alternatives, to give you something to review and think about. 


This is a summary of the main points I made on this game:

- Play the big moves. If nothing is in danger of dying, look for the big open spaces. The move you want to play is probably somewhere around here.

- If the opponents groups are already separated and you can't see a way to kill it, play somewhere else. Look for the big moves. Maybe later in the game, one of these groups will come under attack again when you have a stronger position.

- Don't play moves in big open spaces for no reason other than to occupy space. Look at your existing groups and then expand out from them. You can have the biggest wall possible and it still won't do anything if it's just facing enemy groups that are already alive.


Enjoy,
GreenGrass];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[iq];W[co]C[Flamer [15k\]: my standard fuseki as white or black, is it slow or effective?


GreenGrass: By definition, a 3-4 corner enclosure is going to be slower than the 4-4. 
Black J3 is actually an unusual play, but because of its placement, C5 is now actually facing the wrong way, since something around K3 is where white would want to play. Maybe D5 is slightly better, but for you, I would say that C5 is ok.]
;B[cl]LB[cc:A][qc:B][qq:C]C[GreenGrass: Just so you know, this is not a good move. It approaches the white corner from the wrong direction and there are still three open corners (A - C).]

(;W[cg]LB[ci:B][cj:A]C[GreenGrass: This is ok, but if you want to play in this area, you may also consider a more severe pincer/extension in the vicinity of A-B (see variation).]
;B[jj];W[jd];B[ld];W[gq]LB[qf:B][pj:C][qn:A]C[GreenGrass: By this point, it should be obvious that Black is attempting to build a big moyo. However, it's still very open. 
Here, G3 is a relatively small move and there are still a lot of holes in Black's potential "moyo". There is more space on the right side, so A - B are bigger moves.]
;B[ci];W[gd]LB[qf:B][pj:C][qn:A]C[GreenGrass: White K16 is on the fourth line, so this is light. You don't have to worry immediately about it being captured, unlike Black C8 which needed to make a base. Because of White C13, Black had an easy time playing C11. I would still say that A - C are still bigger.]
;B[pj];W[pg]C[Flamer [15k\]: too aggressive of a move?

GreenGrass: Now White is late to the party. Black is already staking out his territory. If anything, this is probably not aggressive enough.]

(;B[qg]C[GreenGrass: Basic instinct says that when you see an attachment, you should hane.]

(;W[ng];B[lg];W[qf];B[qh];W[rf];B[pf];W[pe];B[of]
(;W[qd];B[oe];W[qe];B[pc];W[qc];B[nd]
(;W[sh]C[GreenGrass: Unecessary. Endgame move = pass. See variation.]
;B[sj]C[GreenGrass: This is even worse than White T12. Unless under circumstances (life and death), you don't play on the first line until endgame.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[qi];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni]C[GreenGrass: Not exactly sente.]

(;B[mh];W[nk]LB[qn:A]TR[pp]SQ[pj][rj][sj]C[GreenGrass: White is already out and connected, so Black has many holes in his position. O9 is small. Playing something around A threatens to cut off the upper square stones from the triangle corner.]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[ol];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr]

(;B[mr];W[mq]C[Flamer [15k\]: correct response to the N2 stone in this situation?

GreenGrass: This is a good move. N2 is an overplay. Black should extend once more (see variation).]
;B[lq];W[mp];B[lr];W[op];B[oo];W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[so];W[sp];B[qn];W[ll]LB[cc:A]SQ[nk][nl]C[GreenGrass: This move isn't really doing anything. Even if the square stones somehow get captured, that's not a big deal. Don't let your stones get heavy. 
White's corner is still open.];B[mi]CR[nk][nl]LB[nj:1][jl:2]
TR[ll][mo]SQ[qe][rf][sh][ni]C[GreenGrass: White 1 makes bad shape. and is unnecessary.
The circled stones have Miai for possible connection to square group or triangle group. Yes, the triangled stones can be cut, but white can jump out at 2 and should live. However if you're worried, White can fix his shape in sente later (not now)..]

(;W[nj];B[qj];W[jo]LB[gg:B][ho:A]SQ[dp][ep][fp][gp][eq][fq]
C[GreenGrass: Again, not really doing anything. There's only maybe a few points here in the middle.
If you want to play a move like this, maybe A is better; It's connected to the other side, which also potentially makes you a few points instantly. Something around B is also big.]

[eo][fo][dp][ep][fp]C[GreenGrass: This doesn't really do anything. If you're going to play here, just play A to claim your points.
However, B is still bigger.]

;B[fp];W[fq];B[dk];W[ek];B[dj];W[ei];B[dh]C[Flamer [15k\]: is there a way to invade into black's territory on the left?]
;W[eg]SQ[gh][gj][gl]C[GreenGrass: What are these stones doing?  Black can still play anywhere he wants. White has not enclosed ANY territory. The last several moves is basically the same as passing.]
;B[dg];W[df];B[eh];W[fh]C[GreenGrass: White is strong here so in this situation this isn't such a big deal, but you need to be aware of the many cuts you have here.]
