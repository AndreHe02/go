C[Hi Jiro,

I am a 7k on KGS and will be looking at your game, hope you find my comments useful!

I think you have a nice, light style and with a little practice you will become a strong player quite easily.

Enjoy the review!

Riaan (TrueOrgan on KGS)];B[qd]C[J: could u point out all the mistakes that wht makes?
TO: I will do my best :)];W[dd]C[idealia [14k?\]: salut];B[pq]
C[Jiro068 [16k?\]: bonjour];W[dp];B[eq]C[TO: This is a very unorthodox approach, one I have never seen before.  It has to be punished immediately I feel, since a contact move like that will only make white stronger if he responds.]

(;W[jj]C[TO: This is not a good response, since the contact move at E3 begs for a response.  I would rather play a move there.]
;B[qk]TR[dd][jj][dp]SQ[qd][pq]C[TO: If we look at the board position at this stage, black seems a lot better off.  The right side will be difficult to invade effectively, while the weakness around D10 for white is very painful.  This is why K10 was not the best move.  Also, the unresolved situation around D4 will make it's future uncertain.]
;W[dj]C[TO: This is not a bad move, but you should not have to make it like this.  Black gets the initiative here, and with a black move around K16 you will find it difficult to convert your large framework into territory.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb]
(;W[fc]C[TO: I think this move was a mistake, you should rather take the corner as shown in the variation.]
;B[fb]
(;W[gb];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[cf];B[hb]
(;W[hc];B[ga];W[gc];B[ib]C[TO: This is not good for black, as your tengen stone is becoming more and more useful here.  I would continue running at J17.]

(;W[jp];B[jr]C[TO: This is not an appropriate response I feel.  I would punish directly by playing H3]

(;W[lp];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[dn];B[cp];W[kd]C[J: how could wht have done better at the bottom left corner?
TO: I have shown you a few possibilities in earlier variations.]

[bc]C[TO: Bad shape. Should avoid empty triangle if at all possible.]
;B[do];W[en];B[cn]
(;W[dm]C[TO: Bad shape];B[cm];W[cl];B[mq];W[mp];B[fg]C[J: how should wht have responded to that?
TO: Here I think you have to remember where your weaknesses are.  You are not interested in the bottom, since black cannot make life there and you are strong. Black is looking to make the E16 cut eventually, so defence there might be neccesary.  Black is also trying to run toward the center around K13 to escape.  There are no other means of living.  Either escape east, or make small life.  So you just have to remain calm and play solid and black will inevitably die.]

(;W[dh];B[ic]
(;W[ie];B[ig]C[TO: This jump is too long I think, so you can either cut or block.]

(;W[id]C[TO: This is not urgent, since a black move there would inflict minimum damage.]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[oc];W[ne];B[ng];W[kg];B[ke];W[ld];B[jf]C[TO: Here you have nothing to fear from the cut since if you do not secure...]

(;W[fh]C[TO: Letting black have ponnuki here is very bad!];B[gf]
SQ[fg][hg][gh]C[TO: This is a very strong shape called ponnuki! It completely ruins your territory here since it is very influencial.]
;W[eg]C[TO: No way to defend easily.];B[gg];W[ge]SQ[fe][ef]
[fi]C[TO: Too many weaknesses...];B[fe]
(;W[he];B[ef]SQ[fe][gf][fg]C[TO: Ouch!]
(;W[ei];B[fi]C[TO: Not good move by black, cut at E16 is huge! He missed his chance and you should connect at E16 next I think. Let him have the E12 stone!]

(;W[eh];B[ed];W[fd];B[ee];W[hi];B[gi];W[gk];B[fk];W[fm];B[oe]
;W[qg]C[TO: This is overplay I think...];B[qf];W[pi];B[ni];W[ea]
C[TO: Not meaningful, only strengthens black.];B[da];W[nk];B[qi]
C[TO: Big black mistake, should simply cut at P10 i think, you are very lucky!

Nothing spectacular happens further, black has a big lead and keeps it for the rest of the game.  You should watch out for bad shape as I showed you. You will be amazed at the good things that happen when you start playing shape.

Hope you find this review useful!
