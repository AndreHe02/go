(;W[ce]C[FM: this looks a bit slow to me];B[fq]C[FM: good approach side]
;W[cn]
(;B[cq]TR[pp][fq][mq]C[FM: very fighting style. In a game I would be afraid to play this way for if white makes a strong group, a splitting move in the lower side may trouble the marked stones, which also happened.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[jq];B[qq]
C[FM: As black responds here, white gets a nice position on the lower side.]

(;W[rq]LB[fp:A]C[FM: Quite territorial play. A is the biggest point here.]

(;B[rr]LB[pn:A][mo:B][hq:C]C[Wouldn't A be better? I didn't think of it until I reviewed it.

FM: this move is a bit submissive. I would prefer B or direct starting a fight around C. If black answers here, white got a very nice kikashi as T3 - S2 protected his stones against S6 in sente.]
;W[fp];B[jc];W[sr]C[FM: very bad move. R4 will not be sente anymore and S6 will work again.]
;B[qr];W[po]C[FM: Should be before T2 if white wanted to play this.]
;B[qo]
(;W[op]LB[ro:A]C[Overplay, should be at A I think.

FM: this move is interesting]
(;B[oo];W[pn];B[np];W[qp];B[oq];W[ro]C[FM: painful for white - lost sente]

(;B[oe]LB[lc:A][qf:B]C[Was this the best move? I felt it was definitely one of the
big moves because it eliminated A from being a serious
threat and removed aji from both A and B.

FM: this move is territorial and tries to claim an easy win. It does not secure much territory directly and requires a lot of reading before being played: if white manages to invade succesfully, this stone may cause only overconcentration. I don't know if it is really the best, my feeling would put it on O15, but its really hard to say.
In a game I would play like in my variation.]

(;B[ne];W[nf];B[qe];W[me]
(;B[ke];W[pg]C[FM: This is very big. Black should probably play here himself.]
;B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[bk]LB[ph:A]C[Certainly unacceptable.

FM: big point, but C8 was better - makes aji in the black group while playing a bit more on the influence and making the K5 move bigger. Anyway A is the biggest move now.]
;B[nh]C[FM: Good feeling, white does not have really good answer here.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[qi];B[oi]
(;W[lf]C[Much too passive.

FM: strange move.];B[lh];W[kf]
(;B[jf]C[FM: The losing move I think. Forces white to go to the center and become strong.]
;W[kh]
(;B[lg]LB[ki:A]C[I played this to be able to play A.

FM: painful decision];W[kg];B[ki];W[ji];B[kj];W[ok]TR[jf]C[Big move. Black shape becomes small and white is strong. Because of the marked stone.]

(;B[nk];W[nl]
(;B[mk];W[oj];B[nj];W[jj]TR[cg][cj]C[FM: The influence point making the marked stones quite weak now. The game is probably over now.]
;B[jk];W[ik]
(;B[ih]C[FM: questionable. You forced white to connect in sente, but if you have tenukied, white would have to connect here in gote anyway.]
;W[jh];B[jl];W[hj];B[ii]C[This I believe was my biggest mistake. A would have
been better. Not that is was horrible though, just
substandard.

FM: Unfortunately, I dont see where the A is.];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg]
;B[gh];W[ij];B[je];W[gg];B[fh];W[fg]C[Here I got lost by time :(
Overall, I thugh I played a reasonable game, but I felt that
during the fight, I played more like I was trying to kill his
group than gain territory. Can you please show me how
you would have attacked?
Thanks so much!

FM: you are right. All the game you had the upper hand I think and the move 73 was a good opportunity to get strenght and let white live while ruling the board. Unfortunately, the result of a go game is often decided by one move like this.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me
Thanks for attention
