C[Thanks for taking a look at my game.  I played white and won by .5.  It's maybe not the perfect game for review because both sides made big careless mistakes throughout the game, but there were a few moves with comments that I'm particularly interested in.  I also wonder if you have any advice on my endgame play.  There are a few better moves that I can see upon review, but I wonder whether I should've adopted a more mutual-damage oriented strategy.  It seems like I had a bigger lead before the late endgame which I almost allowed to slip away.
Thanks again!

Sure thing.  I'm not loaded with technical knowledge and I usually play by feel so don't expect perfection but I'm sure you'll find it 'interesting'...]

;B[bn];W[cm]TR[fq]C[This sequence of course was not joseki.  My assumption on looking back at it is that it ends up about even, possibly even slightly in my favor, with black accepting a slight loss locally in order to gain sente.  However, with his next  move black was able to form a large framework which perhaps with correct play I would've had a harder time invading.  Perhaps I should've played tenuki here instead of extending?  Or should I accept this outcome?

***Sente Is not a small thing here at all. The marked stone can become active later. I think white could have done better without the pincer. You pretty much have to extend C7 when he does B6. it's fine.]

The triangles show the area of the board that black's move works with his other stones to greatly influence.

the squares are the direction the move sort of penetrates into contested territory.

Even though this move wasn't strictly speaking an attack it was enormous.]
;W[hc]LB[jp:B][nq:A]C[This also seems questionable perhaps.  Without this stone I was worried about an invasion around C15, but maybe another move to prevent his framework from becoming any larger was more urgent.

*** I agree completely.

A looks like a better choice. but I think black stands better after a 3 space high pincer at B]

(;B[lq]LB[jp:A]C[***Horrible.  

A was a much better pincer in every way.];W[no]C[***
Yep];B[pn];W[kp]C[This is why M3  is bad. on K4 if it gets attacked it has help from the k10 stone. here it's just going to have to struggle for life and let white get strong toward the middle for very little actual gain.]

(;W[mr]LB[ip:A]C[I assume in retrospect that there was no way to kill this group and I should've extended at J4 instead

*** I agree.

'Winning' a fight doesn't always mean killing the group.

If he lives really small in gote and totally cut off from the middle that's a complete failure as it is. killing him would just be icing on the cake.

the variation shows that living isn't so easy after A];B[ip]

black seems determined to keep you in the game.

blocking at A very likely kills the O3 stones. eyeless and no place to run.  At the very least black will convert the entire right side into territory while pursuing them]
;W[pq];B[lm];W[nc]C[***Good for you. Black's move was tiny and clearly didn't merit a response.  the life and death in that area is settled he could have made a big move elsewhere.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pg];W[ke]C[I was very uncertain about this move, but didn't really see a better way to get out or make life.  Should I have made a shallower invasion in the first place considering that I have a good amount of territory myself?  Or is there a better followup here?

*** I like your move.];B[kd];W[le];B[je];W[ld]LB[jf:A]C[***This looks a little slow though


Now its easy for black to save k15.  K14 is agressive and helps to make eye shape.]

;W[nf]C[I was very unsure about this situation.  I wanted to make an eye at least, figuring that one eye beats no eyes.  Was this move necessary?  Connecting at H13 would have been big, but I wanted to make sure that I could win the semeai here.  I even considered playing in this area a second time because I had trouble telling what would happen.

***you just died.

I give the variation here.  Just prevent M10 by playing there yourself and it looks sekiish (is that a word?) but now you die as the variation shows]

;B[fj]C[***not really sure what to say about all this since M10 is so important. B7 looking good I guess.]
;W[gm]C[Did I have a better sequence around here?  I wanted to aim at the three black stones at H4 and the one stone at K10 while preserving the option to connect to the left, but this particular point didn't end up working.  A more conservative move at H8 perhaps?

*** well, m10 is still better b7 looks good. F8 first might be good.  this is just an overplay]

;W[sj];B[rk];W[sk];B[rl];W[rm];B[qk];W[pk];B[re]LB[sc:A]C[***ok so now its the endgame

What you want to do is find moves that make points in sente. A good start is T17. if black plays there thats an extra point to him and you HAVE to respond. so he gets sente back.

by playing there first you foce him to finish with s18 after he blacks and you capture.

the move you made doesnt appear to give you any points, take any from him, or force him to respond. so I'm saying its bad.]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[ms];B[ks];W[mq]LB[sr:A]C[ok that saved you a point but in gote

T17 is still good. A is big too];B[sr];W[rs];B[ss];W[qr]LB[mq:A]
[sr:B]C[***

You would have lost one point at A if you didnt play there. You lost like three for letting him get B. You also took gote again.]

[sp][aq][bq][ar][br][as][bs][cs]C[***OK the things in your thinking that really stand out to me: 

--your endgame, you need to look at the territory borders and figure out what makes you points or takes them from the other guy, and then out of those which you can do in sente. clearly you didnt do that.

--you got carried away in the life and death and played an extra move locally after the life and death was settled.  this is a huge leak in your game. These fights happen every single game and tossing away sente for nothing or very little costs probably at least 10 points every time you do it.

--In the opening don't just toss out random pincers and joseki and hope it turns out alright.  Thats fine at 10k but to get past 7k you need to start looking at how stones work together and work hard to figure out which direction you want your stones to go then work hard to make that happen.  don't worry about whether its a joseki it doesn't matter.  

Wing it if you have to.

--t
The fighting in general was kind of sloppy but your opponent was just as sloppy. So your fighting is probably about normal for your rank.  That will improve with time and experience. Some people say solving problems helps. If you're like me and dont like to sit there trying to solve problems, then watching a lot of high dan games can also help your fighting ability improve. 

Thanks for letting me review your game!
