I played black and lost by 4.5 points. I have been stagnating around 4k for a while now and I am not too sure of what are my main weaknesses.

If you're not sure of your weaknesses, they are probably strategic, because tactical weaknesses tend to make themselves obvious. Therefore I will try to concentrate on strategic comments, and you should try to pay more attention to the strategic things I say (though I can't help but comment on tactical issues that come up).

Also I expect you to look at every variation in this file, without me saying anything like "see var."]
;W[qp];B[cd];W[ec]
(;B[hd]C[I guess a pincer is best here due to Q16

Yes, in that fighting is good and it works with your strength in the other corners.

But d15 also works well because of where the r4 stone is. I know that's not at all obvious, but the variation shows it a bit better.]
;W[df]C[So now I have to look at a joseki dictionary...

But Sensei's Library doesn't have this variation! Nor does Kojo's joseki dictionary!

So there must be a fundamental problem with it. Let's see if it's obvious (though for reasons already discussed I'm not fussed if we don't find it).]

(;B[ld]C[I guess this is not bad for me, but only thanks to the handicap stones.

m16 is probably your first strategic mistake. What is it trying to achieve? To me, it says "I claim from g17 to q16 as my territory". But that's too big a claim!

White is strong on the left. Incredibly strong, or thick if you prefer. Generally you should play away from strength. But the main problem with your move is...

Are you trying to save g17/h16? Then play closer to them, because they are right next to thick white stones and they will need serious help. So play a move like j17, k16, j15 or h14. Do these moves seem too small? Then perhaps you shouldn't be trying to save those two stones.

Those two stones are not strategically important right now!

Or are you trying to make territory with q16? Then play a move like m17, or o16, or o17. But then White might move to capture h16. So perhaps no move in that area is good. Which would make sense, because White is so strong there!

So the real problem with m16 is it tries to do lots of things, but doesn't do anything well. There is *specific* weakness at k16, j17 and o16. You made a move that left 3 specific weaknesses in your position.]
;W[qf]C[Honestly I think White should jump straight in to k16. It uses his thickness and starts fighting, and can't possibly get hurt because there is so much space above and below that point. Your best defence would be to try to make White capture the two stones small and in gote, but I think it would be a reasonable bet that you'd (incorrectly) try to save everything, and that's exactly what White wants in a handicap game.

Although this move does have the advantage that any response leaves your corner either too thin or over-concentrated.]
;B[qd]C[Maybe a bit slow. I was planing to take the initiative at P4 after a white extension, and I find my upper right moyo big. I don't like the pincer due to R4

o17 would be overconcentrated and too low.

o16 would be overconcentrateg and too high.

s16 would be too thin.

tenuki would be too thin.

I think this move is probably best, but I bet you wish m16 was almost anywhere else now.

o17 and you could play at s16.

o16 and you could play at s16 or here.

n17 -> here

n16 -> here

k16 -> o17

j17 -> o16]
(;W[nd]C[Not bad, but it risks you ending up strong on both sides. I prefer k16. The o16 weakness will not easily be resolved, and will probably still be available later.]
;B[pf]C[I know you are expecting White to respond, but r14 is only one stone. What if White plays o14 now? And if White does tenuki, r14 is going to maintain a lot of aji.]
;W[qg];B[ne];W[md];B[me];W[lc];B[kc]C[I am strong in the area so I find that just extending would be too submissive

Agreed. White is fixing your problem for you.];W[kb];B[mc];W[lb]
;B[nc];W[kd];B[le];W[jc]
(;B[hf]C[This is your biggest strategic mistake of the whole game. You have two weak stones squeezed tight between two strong white groups. And I mean really strong. And you are trying to save these two stones.

When I first saw the situation after White captures at k17, my first thought about those two black stones is "I don't want to save them." Saving them is going to cost a lot.

My first thought when I saw your move here was "White k14! Attack!"]
;W[jf]
(;B[if];W[jg]C[Tactically, I'm sure you can see that the j14/k13 exchange is not good for you.

Strategically, it doesn't make sense to make such a forcing move unless it is double sente and him playing it first is worse for you, or it covers a specific weakness in your position (more importantly the latter). I can't see a specific weakness in your position here, so a forcing move here doesn't seem urgent.]
;B[hh];W[fh]C[He's essentially covered both sides. You haven't escaped (yet).]
;B[ii]C[I hesitated about this move. Maybe too slow, but I find it still keeps some pressure on the white group

Which White group? They're both so strong.];W[eg]
(;B[dg];W[qj]
(;B[op]C[I notice you're not attacking the top white group. It's at least sente, and it makes eye shape for you at the same time.]
;W[mq]C[Yes, White wants to attack. This is probably a good move, making it easiest to make solid life on the bottom side.

I think your strategic mistake here was giving White something to attack. You could play much simpler by reducing on the right, and then extending along the bottom.]
;B[no];W[jq]
(;B[gq]C[I like this move, taking profit while keeping pressure on the white group. I don't feel that P4 is in immediate danger.

I don't see the profit or feel the pressure. White's stones are low, and so can't do anything grand. Attack White at the top, or attack r4. g4 is the kind of move you'd rather play in response to White c6 or something similar, because then it would be a dual purpose move. And you don't mind White playing f3 because k3 is low.

When you play this move, you leave p4/o5 between strong White positions. Those stones will probably have to run to live.]
;W[pn];B[lp]C[Instead of this, it's probably worth jumping in to r3 to see what you can get out of the corner. Being closed into the corner is probably okay, because the outside is not too interesting at the moment.]
;W[lq];B[kp];W[jp]
(;B[km]C[No, this is too far away. It makes the push at n5 more likely to lead to a cut. l6 instead allows a great shape move of k5 afterwards, and if White responds it can easily be treates as kakashi, with lots of aji left]
;W[jo];B[eh];W[fg];B[ei]C[I liked this moves a lot, working well with D4. Again, at this point, I am feeling that P4 can take care of itself.]
;W[cn]

(;B[ce];W[ck];B[cj]C[b9 instead would be interesting. Try out that variation. I think you might capture the stone, but the real question is does White get enough out of it to severly attack the h14 group?]

C[vdust [2k\]: thanks for the game
Tom0 [4k\]: thx


I feel that I lost this game because w made much profit after chasing my P5 group. Maybe I could have protected it earlier. I guess I could also win the game by not answering w E9 and some other endgame moves.

Thanks a lot for the review.

I know I've been a bit vague in places. I've put in variations without saying anything about them. Where I've done that, I think the point (i.e. the line is playable or not) should be clear. If not, e-mail me.

The endgame wasn't great but it wasn't too bad. Even after 162, I'm confident you could still win.

Your biggest mistakes were:
12 c13
18 m16
36 h14
50 g3
98 h10
162 h3

The strategic mistakes are more important than the tactical mistakes. The tactical mistakes are more important than the endgame mistakes.

It's good that you got your game reviewed. I think you've got a lot of potential for improvement. Keep looking at your games and trying to identify your strategic mistakes, and when you lose games and you can't figure out why (or how you could have avoided it), submit those games for review.]

But r4 is facing d4. It is 'looking' at d4. It is on the 4th line with respect to d4. It is interesting with respect to d4.

r4 is on the third line with respect to q16. It is looking away from q16. It is uninteresting with respect to q16.

The placement of r4 suggests the next area to play from it is the bottom side. Perhaps f3. But if you ignore precisely where the white stone is, the corner White would rather be playing in is the top right (rather than the stronger bottom left). So White would prefer that r4 was actually on q3. Then White r14 is a great move.

But the way it stands, this result is good for you, and so d15 was a viable play.]
