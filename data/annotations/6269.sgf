AB[dd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi!
Thanks for reviewing my game!
I played black in this game, and give some advise on how can I improve my play.
-------------------------------------------------

Hi,

When you read my comments, keep in mind that you you played this game against a computer and that it also made mistakes. I have commented where I believe you made significant mistakes.

Overall, your greatest weakness is that your moves are passive and overly defensive. You should not be afraid to attack. 

-GreenGrass];W[jq];B[jc];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[or]LB[pn:A]C[This move is unnecessary. There is no way that white can immediately sneak into the corner. To take territory on the side, A would be a normal move.]
;W[lp];B[gq];W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[en]LB[dj:1][dl:A][fo:B]C[RIght idea, wrong move. You want to contain white, but white has too many liberties so such a direct approach should result in failure. It didn't because white didn't play correctly, but a move in the vicinity of A or B may be better. Enclose from a distance. It helps that you already have the marked stone.]
;W[nr];B[em];W[ql];B[qn];W[ol];B[qg];W[dg];B[ch];W[fg];B[cl]
C[Perhaps not the most urgent nor the biggest move.];W[hg];B[in]
LB[gd:A][fg:1][lq:2]TR[jc][dd]C[Big move, but there is no way that group 1 can connect to group 2 yet. Perhaps it would be better to concentrate on securing corner territory while pressuing A. Maybe try something simple like A, which also strikes a balance between the marked triangle stones.]
;W[hi];B[gk];W[cg];B[dh];W[nk];B[on];W[ee];B[cc]LB[fc:A]TR[gk]
[in]C[I don't understand this move. It almost seems like you are unreasonably afraid of whie jumping into the corner. If you were afraid of white taking territory on the side, you should not have played the marked stones. Instead of this move, you can try something around A. Locally, this is the area that white wants to play in now.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[lk];B[jl];W[nc];B[qc]LB[oc:A]C[Again, a passive move. You're defending your territory, but that's all. If you play instead, you both protect the corner and attack the white invasion.]
;W[fc];B[lb]C[This is low. It's almost like you want the white stone to escape into the center.]
;W[ne]C[...like this.];B[ng];W[ld];B[gc];W[eb];B[gd];W[jh];B[ed]
;W[jf]
(;B[ln];W[mi];B[qq];W[gb];B[hb];W[fd]LB[fe:A]TR[ee][fg]C[Remember this formation. Since the ladder works, it cannot be cut at A.]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[hd];W[db];B[cb];W[bh];B[bi];W[bg];B[de];W[ef]
;B[be];W[ki];B[cq]TR[co][dp][gq]C[Protect the san-san is good? Realize that played in four.

---------------

I'm actually not completely sure about this one. I think because of your marked stones, and no strong white stones around, a white invasion at 3-3 will die. If you're not sure though, since you're ahead, playing this might be ok to ensure your territory.]

;W[fi];B[he];W[ff];B[hq];W[ir];B[ko]LB[lg:B][nn:A]C[Greedy. Your stones are too spread out. It looks a bit dangerous for black, with not much to gain.. It looks like the point of this move is to reduce white by 1 point. Maybe A or B  instead.]

C[Why did you play this? Your group is not in any danger of dying. If you're going to ignore white's move and play here, at least play something like M17. N13 is bigger.]

[cs][ds][es][qs][rs][ss]C[Your endgame needs work. You play too many gote moves. Keep the initiative and take the points that are rightly yours.

It's hard to say anything about your opening since this was a high handicap game. However, in a handicap game, you should be using the stones to your advantage.

You played too passively the entire game and gave away too much territory unnecessarily. For example, in the upper left corner: most of that should have been yours. Instead, you played in the lower left-of-center even though you were already strong there. Where you're strong, you have the advantage and thus you can attack.

Also, you are too afraid of your opponent taking the corner, even when it's not even possible. I saw this happen in every corner. Even if he/she manages to take the corner, you need to understand that it's an exchange. In return for  some corner territory, you get outside inflence, weakening whatever stones that he/she has on that side. If the timing is wrong, your opponent invading on the 3-3 can actually be GOOD for you.

I hope this review has helped. You underestimate yourself. You need to be more confident about your moves.

Best wishes on improving your game,
