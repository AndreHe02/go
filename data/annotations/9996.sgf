;B[pd]C[Hello, thanks for reviewing this ;)
I placed some comments when i had questions or remark, but it's the moove i saw, so feel free to comments all moove that seems strange for you, and especially these who seems bad ;).
If you've remarks with my general playstyle, i'll happy to take it too.
Well, thank you for advance :)


Hello, I'm Julien, 2k in France (1k-1d on kgs). I've added comments and variations in your game.
Here is a resume:
- I think that you could improve by having a more whole board thinking instead of a local one: it is clear during the fuseki. Also, several times you play very small local moves. In particular, you just follow your opponent moves instead of looking yourself for the biggest spot.
- you have sometimes shape moves (tactical issue)
- you also have sometimes direction issues (strategical issue)]

(;W[dm]TR[em]C[This move is not joseki. The normal move is E7 to protect the cut: even if the cut does not work well right now, there is now a lot of aji (C7 absolute sente for example). You can also tenuki. In this position, I would consider to play O3.]
;B[bn]C[Black should have tenuki (or at least C7).];W[fp]C[White should have tenuki too :-). Playing here is possible (even if a bit slow) if you haven't play D7: now it is just super slow :-).]

(;W[pr]C[This move is the most standard joseki, but I would'nt have play it in this position because I would like to use my wall on the left to build a moyo.]

(;B[qq]
(;W[lp]C[Joseki but a bit slack in this position: still I'd like to use the white influence on the left.
In general, it is a bad idea to use a wall to make territory like this because the wall is not 100% efficient. You should use it to build a moyo as big as possible and/or to fight.]

[qi]C[Hum, i think it's the first moove who make me in difficulty, is it a good way to invade the black area ? Or maybe in R13 i don't really know here.

I would approach at O17. In general, you should take the wider side, except if you prefer to attack some weak stones. Here the north is wider than the west (9 vs 5) and there is nothing possibly weak on the west.]
;B[qe]
(;W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd]C[Maybe playable but now the corner is big for black.]

(;W[oe]TR[pe][re][qf]C[The white sequence up to the previous move aims to play lightly in order to escape quickly (or counter-attack). But you just get a super heavy group with this P15 stone. All the triangle stones could be considered light. Now P15 is an heavy group.

I haven't read any sequence (so I don't know which ones could be playable), but I added a few moves to be considered. Possibly other light moves in the O13 area are possible too, but not yours definitively ;-).]

(;W[qi]C[Playing a kosumi on the 3d line against a stone of a 4th line is usually a bad move.]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[oi]TR[qi]C[Here, i had the feeling that if i didn't cut him, the white position will be too much close and make too much influence for black, but if black played P12 and not O11 i don't really know what would happen.

This black response is exactly why the R11 move was bad: it is very difficult to answer against this hane at the head of 2 stones.]

(;B[mk]C[These 2 white stones look pretty small.]
(;W[nl]C[I would have let these 2 stones: they are both small in term of points and very painful for black in term of aji. By adding stones to them, they just become an heavy group to manage: you are shooting yourself ;-).]

(;B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[nn];B[ki];W[jd]C[Right direction but maybe L17 locally better: the black "moyo" is still very open and it will be hard to make points in the center for black anyway.]

[cf][dg][cj]C[I played here to make influence and possibily territory with the stones in K,J and theses, but it make maybe black strong and prevent me to invade the right with C12 for example ?

That is true. Against this black marked shaped, it is either possible to invade or to attack at E14 to develop the north and the choice between these 2 options should be taken with care since it is not possible to do both (except if black tenuki ;-)).

Here, since black is super strong in the center with the K11 group, any invasion at C12 is now rather dangerous. Consequently I think that your choice is ok.]
