C[This is my first game in GTL
i played Black
thank you for comment
i hv some questions
1)what i must improve for my games
2)what is the book that may help me
3)how can i find U on the net

Arend: Very close and exciting game! I think a good way for you to improve is trying to get a feeling how much one move can shift the balance in a fight between 2 weak groups. It is very important to try to get ahead in such a fight, and for example be the first to jump out towards the center. (In moves 29, 47, 65, 83 you missed a chance to get ahead.)
On the other hand, you showed a good feeling for shape. So I am sure you will be able improve your judgement of such running fights quickly.
Have you read "Attack and Defense"? I learnt a lot from this book, and if you understand the concepts explained there well, you should be 1-dan soon.]

Arend: This move is also joseki, but I think it requires a ladder to be good for white.]

(;B[jp]C[i think if i play D7 white will play aroundL4
so i decide to play K4
Arend: K4 is good direction, but I think you can play D7 first.]
;W[lq];B[dm]C[Arend: Good move. Black's shape would get weak if white got to play here.]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[hq]C[now it's hard for me to use my thickness  now
Arend: Quite to the contrary! A fight in front of your wall is the best that can happen to you. White H3 is bad, but the fight that follows is difficult.]
;B[jr]C[try to attack
Arend: Excellent.];W[ho]
(;B[in];W[hn]
(;B[fo]TR[in][hn]LB[cl:A]C[help my left group
Arend: It is bad to play the exchange of the marked stones and leave it at that. (I'll show you how white can punish this with the next move, but  I think it is more important that you get the feeling that this exchange strenghtens white more than it helps black. After a contact play, it is almost always urgent to play on.)
Two things:
1. I think you need not worry about the left group so much. If white already hat a stone at A (C8), it would be a different story. But the way it is, he cannot do much.
2. If you are afraid of your left group, you should play the previous move differently. See the variation there.]

(;W[io]C[Arend: This is a bad move. Never push through a keima if you don't want to cut.]
;B[jo];W[im];B[jn];W[hl];B[mp];W[nq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr]C[miss read now
Arend:  This move might be ok.];W[kr];B[kq];W[ls];B[lp];W[lr]
C[good luck i hv sente]
(;B[np]C[Arend: This move is aji-keshi. Black has quite good possibilities in the corner, e.g. at Q3, without it.]
;W[oq];B[gp]C[Arend: This move is a bit slow. It does make D4 alive, but it is gote, and being ahead in the center is more important for the moment.]
;W[iq]C[painful for me];B[jq];W[cl];B[gm];W[hm];B[dl];W[kl]
C[Arend: I think now White can feel good.];B[lm];W[pn]LB[ll:A]
[mm:B]MA[lp][mp][np]C[Arend: White should play "A" first. it strenghtens the white group, but the black stone at "B" (assuming black will reply there) will be worthless, because it is so close to the marked black stones.]
;B[pj]C[may be a big point];W[ql]C[Arend: Too small.];B[om]
;W[qg]C[what U think about this move?
Arend: It is not where I would play, but I think it is ok. Many moves are possible at this point.]
;B[qe]C[decide secue teritories];W[og];B[ph];W[qf]C[Arend: White should just connect firmly.]

(;B[pf]C[Arend: This move is very bad. It lets White defend against the threatening cut, and the black stones doesn't help black at all (e.g. white can still easily invade at R1).]
;W[pg];B[ne]TR[pf]C[Arend: The marked stones is almost useless. Better play this move directly.]
;W[qi];B[qj]C[Arend: Good.];W[pi];B[pm];W[qm];B[po]C[Arend: Very nice move!]
;W[qo];B[on];W[qn];B[pp];W[pq];B[oi];W[oh];B[ri];W[qh];B[rk]
LB[ni:A]C[
Arend: This feels like endgame. I understnad you want to attack white, but I think it is better to start with "A". This move will help to attack the other black group, too.]

(;W[de];B[ni];W[re];B[rd];W[sf];B[sd];W[sh];B[se];W[of]C[Arend: Mistake (see correct answer in var.)]

(;B[pe];W[oe];B[od];W[mh];B[nh];W[mg];B[me];W[mf];B[sn]LB[ke:A]
[fd:B][ee:C][ce:D][lj:E][kj:F]C[Arend: Hey! It't not endgame yet! Any of the moves marked with a letter are much bigger. I think black should play some kind of splitting attack with E or F.]
;W[sm]C[Arend: White should not answer at all];B[rm];W[rn];B[sl]
;W[so];B[ee];W[jc]TR[de][ee]LB[ef:A]C[I don't know how to do with this
what side is best?
Arend: This move is a little strange. After the contact move, it is very important to continue playing there (with the usual hane at A).
If White wants to play here, he should have done so without  playing the approach move at D15.]
;B[lc]C[Arend: Difficult decision, but I think you chose the right side here.]
;W[fc]MA[jc]C[overextend?
Arend: No, because white is (correctly) treating the marked stone at K17 lightly. I think the stone at D15 ist more important, and you should thus play as in the variation.]

(;B[hc]C[Arend: This move has problems, because...];W[gd];B[hd]
;W[he]LB[ed:A]C[Arend: ..now already black cannot prevent white from connectin with A (E16) anymore.]
;B[jd];W[kd]
(;B[kc]TR[jd][jc][kd][lc]C[Arend: Just looking at the shape of the marked stones, this move seems automatic. But giving white the ponnuki in the following is bad. Black has to play as in the variation. This mistake costs quite a lot.]
;W[id]C[Arend: Now white gets an excellent result.];B[jb];W[je]
;B[ib]C[easy for white now];W[ed];B[ce]C[Arend: Good compromise.]
;W[cf];B[dd];W[df];B[be];W[bf];B[eb];W[dk];B[ek]
(;W[dj]C[Arend: Submissive.];B[ej];W[di]LB[ei:A]C[Arend: Again, white should play hane (A).
The game is close now, but white is leading.];B[hj]C[what is the best point for attack?
Arend: White is now so strong in the center (since he got the ponuki at the top) that you cannot much expect to attack white. All you can achieve is preventing white from gaining much territory in the center, and for this purpose, this move is good.]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[jj];B[ji]C[Arend: This move is probably ok, but you have to remember that you have left a cutting point behind, that you need to defend soon.]
;W[ki];B[ll];W[lk]LB[kk:A]C[Arend: Better at "A".];B[mk];W[lj]
;B[af];W[ag];B[ae]C[i think this is big prevent white b16
Arend: Yes, A14 was very big.];W[bh];B[ec]C[Arend: Don't play this move.]
;W[fd];B[fb]LB[ec:A][fd:B][fe:C]MA[ed]C[Without the exchange A-B, you could now play at C and capture the marked stone.]

(;W[gb]C[Arend; Big mistake. White misses a chance to decide the game here.]
