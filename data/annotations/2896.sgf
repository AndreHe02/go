C[Hello.  on the IGS, I went under the name
James8BS.  In this game, I was the black
player.

This was my second online game against a
human opponent.  I'm not new to the game
of Go by any means, but most of my off-line
matches were either against computers or
beginners whom I personally had introduced to
the game.  A large part of my problem, I think,
is that I'm not used to having to deal with a timer,
and this causes me to make rash actions without
fully considering them first.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Hey,

I did my best with reviewing your game. I tried to examine every of your suggestions and show you how they could work out and to find alternative moves if I didn't like yours.

I often added multiple variations. I'd recommend to take a look at all the ones I included as I tried to choose the most important or interesting ones that I could come up with.

I added my final thoughts at the end of the game and summarized what I think is most important to learn from this game.

If you have any other questions I'd be glad to answer them. My nickname on KGS is Aveneer, or use just email.

Yours,

Jan];AB[pd][dp]C[For some reason, I automatically got two stones
at the beginning of the game.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Jan:

I believe it's merely a handicap of 3 stones; 2 stones on the board and one stone by giving white no komi. Thus it's nothing unusual.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nc]
(;B[ed]LB[jc:A][pc:B]C[I didn't want to be stuck going on the defensive
too early, so I chose to attack.  Looking back,
I believe this was my first mistake.  I should've
played at Q18 and reinforced existing territory.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

This move was indeed a mistake. White's approach move on O17 is a standard move in the opening, and it almost always requires an immediate respond. Remember that at this stage there are no territories whatsoever; the first boundaries of a moyo are indeed often created by playing out an approach move. Hence the term "defense" would be a bit exaggerated as you hardly have something to defend.

In this case, white can freely take territory along the side with A, or steal a large part of your corner with B. Thus, white's stone has enough space to build a solid base, it takes territory and threatens to steal you the corner. 

In contrast, E16 does not have any function whatsover. It does not work to create moyo, it hardly attacks the white stone at all and, by playing directly next to a white stone, it is very limited in its development. 

In the opening, it's almost never a good idea to play directly next to an opponent stone, mainly because it loses a lot of development potential and even strenghtens the opponents position. See next move.

See variations for other possible moves.

Also, when playing against a handicap, it is natural that white has to be on the offensive and black relies on his advantage if winning is important. You have 3 corners, whereas white has only 1.]
;W[dc]C[Jan:

Looking at the 3 stones in the upper left corner, one can't help but wonder which stone is really being attacked...]

(;B[de]C[This a typical move for me.  Perhaps I should've
varied my strategy and played at E15 instead of
D15.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

In this case I'd prefer to play solidly. See variations.];W[ce]
;B[pb]C[A few turns too late, I think now.  I was already
in the middle of an attack, I should've reinforced
it at E15 instead of playing here.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Indeed, at play at E15 would've been better. Additionally, focus of the game is on the upper left right now and there are urgent moves there, so playing elsewhere should be out of question.]
;W[kc];B[cf]C[I could see the minute I played this that I had just
made a mistake.  Again, I should've played at
E15.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Rule of thumb: Three hanes in a row from single stones are almost never a good idea.]
;W[ee];B[pr]LB[qf:A][jp:B]C[My bid to reinforce property seemed like a good idea at the time after I realized that I had made a mistake.  Had I thought about it. I would've played at D14 or Q17 instead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

I couldn't find a reason why you would want to play Q2. Firstly, the corner isn't threatened at all. Second, you don't have any property other than small parts of the upper right corner. Every other place *could* turn out to be moyo, but a single stone is not nearly enough to make a corner yours.

A play at A to secure the upper right and have a base for further extension along the side would be better. Playing at B would also be a big move. Q2, however, is a much smaller move and has almost no potential for further development other than aiming at B or maybe K3; I, however, believe that B is already playable as the board stands before Q2. Even if seen as a corner enclosure, Q2 is a slow move.

More importantly, however, the focus of the game is in the upper left corner. If you let white destroy your extremely vulnerable stones, you have lost 3 turns, allowed white to secure territory and gain influence towards two sides and the middle. 

D14 would a very good idea.];W[df];B[ef]LB[cg:A]C[This is me, realizing I made a mistake and fighting futily to correct it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

At this point it black has suffered a huge setback and it will be really tough to rescue any one stone. If you really want to continue playing there, A is the only option I can think of. Your move, however, suffers from the fact that it's a lonely stone and thus very vulnerable. Playing solidly, especially linking up your stones, is the key to survive.

However, maybe now would be a good time to play elsewhere, on the right side or the lower one.]
;W[cg];B[bf]C[Not only should I not have attempted to retake lost land, but I should've seen right then and there that this was going down an unfavorable path.]
;W[be]
(;B[fe]C[Another mistake.  I should've gone to B13.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Maybe B13 could've let to a rescue of the two black stones, but it would give white a lot of influence. See variation.]
;W[fd];B[de]C[This time I pretty much HAD to make this move, because of that awful white stone at F16.]
;W[dg];B[gd]C[I should've played at E15, again.];W[ee];B[fc]
;W[bg]C[Jan:

Since black's position was very weak throughout most of the fight, this result isn't too bad. Black stones are connected and he has room to flee, or even make a base with J17.]

(;B[de]C[At this point I began to wonder if I wasn't fighting an uphill battle.  But I tried anyway.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

I don't understand this move. The two black stones on the left are dead and there is no way to save them (see variation if you still have doubts). Thus, all white stones are connected, which means that taking the ko has no profit for you. Maybe J17 to form a base would be a good idea, or play a move like G14 or F14 to secure the group a bit more.]
;W[ec];B[cd]C[Jan:

You're stones are still dead and white's position is rather solid so you're actually wasting a move and give white the chance to further secure his territory. This applies to your two following moves, as well.]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[af];B[ad];W[ac];B[nd]C[So, I lost the upper left-hand corner.  I wasn't going to lose the upper-right.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Remember: playing right next to an opponent's stone means you're only likely to strenghten it.

Adittionally, you're not doing much good for the upper right corner. Something around R14 would still be the best move to secure the territory, and the stone you play is rather far in the center.]
;W[md]
(;B[oc]C[At the time I wondered if N17 might not have been a better move.  However later in the game, this proved to have been a good call on my part.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

See variation for N17. I like P17.];W[nb];B[mc]C[Jan:

No, no, no. It's pretty obvious that your black stone is rather lonely and as such has little chance to do anything. The two white stones at O18 have a lot of liberties and, most importantly, white can easily trap your stone in a ladder. If you didn't see that white could also catch you like it did, seeing the ladder would've been possible.

I think it's time to remember that Go is not about capturing stones. It's about surrounding territory. Up to now nearly all of your stones have worked to either try to kill a stone or defend a weak position that occurred because you attacked too quickly. While capturing stones is great, it shouldn't be your goal in the game, as is already pretty obvious and will be much more obvious at the end of the game.

One last thing: there is a proverb that goes "Make a fist before striking". Playing a single stone into an opponents territory like this is like making a punch with your thumb in your fist - it's likely to hurt a lot or can even break.]
;W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[ma];W[na];B[jp]TR[oc][nd]SQ[pj][qj]C[I realized trying to take his column was also fruitless.  If I did anything to call attention to that, he'd take my three and I'd be out of luck.  But I remembered that Go is, first and foremost, a game about Territory, so I thought I could still win if I simply gained more ground than him.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Yes, that's the spirit! K4 is a good and big move. Due to the stones you played in the upper right corner, you could easily flee out into the center if need arises, so securing there isn't neccessary.

Q10 and R10 would be other possibilites, but I like your move. Your play at Q2 might help to secure a big portion of the upper side that way.]
;W[cn];B[cb]C[I don't know why I did this.  I should've kept re-enforcing my claims.]
;W[cc];B[bp]C[Jan:

Well done.];W[dk];B[cl]C[I saw what he was doing as an attack, and reacted brashly.  My stone was placed such because I expected him to play at D8 next, which he did...

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

A very good move. It threatens to cut off the single white stone from the top, and an attempt to rescue it will be quite costly.

Note: It's a pretty severe attack against C6, and you're *not* even touching it.]
;W[dl];B[cm]C[...Allowing me to play here and expecting him to play at D7, whcih again he did...]
;W[dm]
(;B[dn]TR[bn]C[..so I played here.  At the time, this looked infallible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

That was your mistake. See variation.];W[bn];B[do]C[But with his last move, I had been caught off guard and had a definite sense of "Uh-Oh."  I SHOULD have played C9 or just let the C8 group die.]
;W[bk];B[bm]C[Jan:

No use in trying to rescue stones you already know are dead.]
;W[am];B[bo]TR[ck][bl]CR[an][co]C[At this point, I quixotically believed that I could still save the C8 group.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Counting the liberties, it's 2 liberties against 2 liberties, but its white's turn. The stones are dead!]
;W[ck];B[co]C[By now I should've realized all was lost.];W[bl]
;B[fo]TR[gp]CR[pj]C[Jan:

Building territory is a good idea. If you really want to on the left, I'd prefer one the marked point, as it greatly helps secure territory.

Another big move would be Q10.];W[qj];B[qn]TR[qm]C[Jan:

Good, maybe a bit better at R7 though.];W[pg];B[cm]LB[cl:A]
[bm:B][an:C][ao:D]CR[al]C[The reason I did this should be obvious, I think.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Actually: no. You're literally wasting a move and even give white an additional point in the process.

That stone accomplishes nothing. White can play elsewhere, and if black plays B, white plays A and vice versa. If black C, white D. See variation.
Additonally, white's group cannot be killed as it already has a big eye and can easily make another eye at A8. If you, however, played at A9 to prevent white from doing so, he could link up his group to the group above with problems.

Lastly, white is attacking your black group above, and it's not secure enough to ignore that. R14 would be a good idea to ensure it's life.]

(;W[an];B[mn]TR[qf][mo][no]C[Jan:

I believe that this move is too wide to actively secure territory. I marked a few possibilities where you might want to play next. R8 might also be interesting, but I think it's rather small. 

Also, your group in the upper left could use a place to make eyes some time, too.]
;W[hn];B[di]C[Here I was thinking I could capture the lower left white group if I merely prevented it from connecting to the above white group.  I should've played at H5.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

This move is bad because of 2 facts: 1. The white group you want to kill is alive once white plays A9. If you really wanted to kill it, than thats where you should play first. However, you cannot do so since white is very thick on the left, making it impossible to attack the group. 

There is a proverb that goes "Don't play near thickness". You're stone is too deep in white's area and is facing two strong white groups. It's almost sure that it's going to die. 

Additionally, even if you managed to cut the two groups off each other AND prevent white from making a second eye, he could easily run out into the center to make eyes there.

All in all, it would be a good idea to secure your territory. H4 would do the job, but I believe H5 could work out, too, because it can be connected to both F5 and K4 .]
;W[ci]TR[ei]C[Jan:

White could've forced you into its territory with E11, where you would be as good as dead as there just isn't enough room to make eyes and all the white groups have lots of liberties. White is actually rather nice here.]
;B[ch]C[And here I should've dropped the mad quest];W[dh];B[bh]
C[Apparently I just never learn.];W[bi];B[ah];W[hp]
(;B[ho]TR[jr]SQ[gq]C[I thought this was a strong move, since no matter what he tried, my stone had support on either side.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

I don't like the H5, actually. Keep in mind that there is a lot of open space in the bottom area; if you allow white to invade it, even force white to do so, you might actually do him a favor. I'll play out a couple of scenarios after the next move.

In this case, I would suggest playing defensively with K2 or G3.

See variations for both moves.];W[io];B[go];W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[I should've played at J6 and forced him to stay downwards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

I think choosing to defend the bottom is better. See variation.]
;W[gp];B[fq]C[Here I had another opportunity to correct my earlier mistake, yet I still chose to try to reel him in instead of blocking off the exit.  This and my last move proved to be my downfall, as I spent the rest of the game trying to capture an ever-enlarging white pile, until finally I realized I had lost and just resigned.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Actually, the situation wasn't too bad at this stage as you managed to defend most of your territory. Additionally, white's group isn't very stable now and you can attack it to gain more territory, even though you most likely won't be able to kill it.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[re];B[rd];W[jo];B[jm]LB[ld:2][me:1][oe:3]TR[jq]
C[I played here because I knew if I played at J6 he'd just atari my stone.  Here I imagined I had flexibility enough to account for everything he could possibly do.  Then his next move was one I hadn't accounted for.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

This move also starts your attack on the group. However, it is noteworthy that even if you succeed in surrounding white, the weakness at K3 is likely to allow it to make eyes. See variation.

Also, your group in the top right is about to get confined which will be a huge sucess for white. Instead of starting your attack, giving atari at N16 and playing P15 right after that would've allowed you to get into the center and limit white's possibilities in the process.

In general, I tried to play through some of your remarks but didn't add a lot of suggestions. This is due to the fact that no matter how you play, it's just about impossible to kill white if it doesn't make huge mistakes. The problem is that your position is just way too unstable to be a base for an all-out attack and that trying to kill white is an overplay. See the end commentaries.]

(;W[im];B[gn]C[This should've been at H7.  I do not know why I played where I did.]
;W[gm];B[jn];W[in];B[fm];W[gk];B[gl]C[Here I was thinking that no matter what he did, the game was in my favor.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

I'm not so sure about that. As you later found out, you base in the lower end of the board is very unstable. Following the proverb from earlier, it might've been a good idea to first "make a fist" by securing it. However, you rushed into the attack, and as a consequence you had a lot of weak points that your opponent could exploit.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[il]
(;B[jk]C[It was with his previous move that I realized the error in my thinking.  I should've played right above his stones, not to the side of it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Jan:

See variation.];W[hk];B[fl];W[jl];B[ik]C[Here I chose to correct an earlier mistake, but it was too little, too late.]
;W[ej];B[kl]C[I began to wonder when he made that last move, but decided to take advantage of it and close in.]
;W[kk]
(;B[ko]C[Another mistake.  I should've tried to atari his one white stone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Maybe not. Due to the aforementioned weaknesses, you're group can't really resist against whites attacks with any of the two moves. Now would have been the time to back down and make a defensive move like L4. 

See variations on whites answers against your possible replies..]

;W[lj];B[jj];W[ne];B[od];W[le];B[lm];W[kl];B[ml];W[mk];B[mm]
C[Jan:

I didn't see why you would want to connect that way. Your stones are in a good shape before, so instead of playing N7 it might have been a good idea to play O8, thus securing some more territory for you and making it harder for white to run to the right.]
;W[ok]C[Jan:

With that move, white has connected the group you've been trying to attack with the right side. Now would've been the last chance to accept that continue attacking won't get you anywhere and to secure some moyo you're attack has granted you.

Instead, what now follows is why you lost the game. Instead of supporting your group in the upper left, rescuing your stones in the center or stabilizing your lower position, you press on an attack on his group. Note how you keep playing moves that only serve to reduce his liberties while he makes big moves to build territory and even attack your stones in the upper left.]

;B[ni];W[oj];B[li];W[mj];B[mi];W[jh]C[Jan:

Now your seven black stones are extremely vulnerable. White has used his turns to make big moves, thus constantly reducing the space you could make eyes in. You can't rescue your 7 stones any more, since you can't make eyes and can't connect them to your other group.

Now would've been a good time to resign.];B[pl];W[ki]TR[oj]
[qj][ok]C[Jan:

The four black stones are dead no matter where you play, but even if they weren't the big white group would still be alive as you couldn't prevent a link up between the marked three stones which means that there is now plenty of room for white to make eyes.]
;B[ji];W[kh];B[ii];W[ih];B[hi];W[gi];B[pi];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj]
;B[ql]C[Jan:

White's next move is a big mistake, but it isn't enough to help you win the game. See variation on how the life of the white group would've been much simpler and effective.]

(;W[sk];B[qi];W[oi];B[oh];W[hj];B[rj];W[rk];B[rm]C[At this point, I resigned, realising that after losing the H11 group, I'd have lost the capturing race and that would be that.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Jan:

Actually, the loss of H11 wouldn't have mattered if white didn't make a big mistake with 159, but the result is the same in the end.

Now I'd like to summarize the most important things for you to learn from this game:

1. In the opening, play moves that have room for development. Take territory, and if you can, make moves that do so as well as limit your opponent's choices. 

2. Answering moves that otherwise leave you at a big loss is *not* a bad idea, despite the fact it might seem "defensive" to you. It's just a reasonable thing to do and cannot be helped.

3. Playing directly next to an opponent's stone is only likely to strengthen it if it doesn't suffer from a shortage of liberties.

4. Take your time. Try to read 3 moves deeper than just deciding what to play, meaning you want to consider your opponents next two moves and your next one in between. 

Or force yourself to come up with one alternative move for every one you make. Yes, rushing sometimes cannot be helped as we're all just human, but that doesn't mean you can't try to get rid of it.

5. "Make a fist before striking." Don't rush attacks, and don't attack without doing a bit of planning first. When you attack, make sure that your stones are stable, for if they aren't they are likely to get attacked instead.

And, most importantly:

6. The goal of attacking is not to capture the stones but to get territory by threatening to do so. Don't make any great efforts to kill a group, and always doubt your ability to do so. If it turns out you can kill it, all the better.

Lastly, I would suggest playing a few 13x13 games before playing the next 19x19s. The reason is that playing on smaller boards will greatly improve your judgement of local situations which will help you to decide when an answer is needed and when you can play elsewhere. I don't know if IGS supports the function, but KGS does for sure.

As already said, I'll gladly answer any additional questions.

Have fun!

Yours,

Jan])
