;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
(;B[cn]C[see variation right before this move.  if this black move isn't needed, then since q16 isn't going to make much territory due to presense of both n18 and q10 stones, how about attacking r10 stone to help make territory as shown in variation.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pm]C[i like white q6 better, since with this q7 white would want the r10 stone to be at r11]
;B[nq];W[qf]C[I didn't know what to do here, I didn't really have that much space.]
;B[nc]C[because black is so open on top, instead of o17, i might like the r17 3-3 move so make quick stability and some territory for black]
;W[nb];B[oc]C[white o18 made more territory and stibility for white, while  black p17 didn't do much for black.

Sometimes I like to match moves up in pairs, and make sure I'm getting as much as my opponent.]
;W[gb]C[seems like instead of this move, if white played m17, black would probably answer and white would have sente since g18 would not be necessary

for black's part, a forcing move such as M17 earlier would help prevent this problem.]

(;B[db];W[cc]C[
instead of this white move, maybe white should force with G17 first.  Maybe black should have forced earlier.

Always look for opportunities to make forcing moves (but not aji keshi) .  A good book is "Beyond Forcing Moves" please look it up.]
;B[gc]C[white should have forced here perhaps.  Although white may have been able to do even better because the g18 move was solid but the d18 move was less solid.  I'm not sure the best way for white to exploit, but I'm pretty sure the black D18 move was not the best way to counter the slow white G18 move.  Maybe  black F18 instead of D18 to keep white restricted ?

I'll poke around in a variation with that];W[fb];B[ec]C[white made more territory on top black didn't make any]
;W[of]C[Black leaves a big mistake with the G17 being filled by black, but I thought it was too small for now]
;B[ch];W[cg]C[how about white c18 that threatens e18.];B[dh]
C[I guess E12 is more popular, but I don't really know the variations for it.]
;W[cb]C[how about white d6 first ?];B[dn]C[
white shouldn't have let black have this move.  If white played D6 himself for example (not sure when though!) then it is sente since white threatens D5, and if black answers it at c7, white is bigger on bottom and black is smaller on left side.]
;W[en];B[em]
(;W[fn]C[see variation for better play for white];B[kq]C[I don't know if I should have jumped out at G4, although I would probably just create a large floating group that would give white phenomenal thickness.]

(;W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kn]C[whtie territory grew more than black territory]

;W[pn];B[no];W[mm]C[if white n6 instead of n7, black still has a problem at m3.  maybe if black had answered n4 with k2, that would both solve the problem and threaten to leak into white's territory]
;B[oj];W[pi];B[ff]C[s16 looks bigger, since it makes black bigger and white smaller.  this f14 only makes black bigger and white can answer at s16.]
;W[eg]
(;B[fg]C[instead of pushing from behind with f13, how about f12 or g12 ?  see variation]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[gh];W[fi];B[ej];W[mj]C[I thought of maybe sacrificing this stone and playing O12, but I thought I should save it.]

;W[rf];B[qe];W[lq]C[ouch.  black should have taken any of several earlier opportunities to play k2 i think]

;W[ng];B[eb]C[Just curious, it actually took him quite some time to read]
;W[hb]C[if this black e18 is sente then white should have played e18 earlier .

I would say the main thing missing for both players in this game is pouncing on small gains with forcing moves.  Such gains can really add up !  [end of review by ericosman@rcn.com 28-sep-2007  enjoy\]]
