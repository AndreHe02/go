C[Hi!
I have made some comments/ asked some questions throughout the SGF. Besides that, any general comments on strategy and tactics would be much welcome.

Also, one thing I have been trying to concentrate on (not very successfully though, I am afraid) is on getting/keeping sente. Could you offer any advice/suggestions on that as well?

Thank you!
Brenno

Even the pros have a hard time with sente, but I'll do my best... :)

After finishing the review, I don't have any specific overall comments; most of your play was quite reasonable.  The biggest single item is to remember the priorities drummed into my head by Yang-sensei: defend first, attack second, make territory last.  In several places, you either didn't defend a weakness, made too aggressive hanes which created weaknesses, or didn't take correct advantage of your opponent's weak groups.  The idea is not necessarily to kill, but to build strength while attacking and use that strength to make territory (or reduce your opponent's) later.

Good luck in future games!

Rick Mott  (KGS RickMott)



Pick [17k\]: hello have a good game
Brenno [15k\]: Hi];B[pp]C[Brenno [15k\]: Good game];W[dc];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[de];W[cg];B[bc];W[cd];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[dd]
;W[cc]C[RickMott: I would prefer to atari at B18, because it makes two eyes.  Otherwise, I don't have much to argue with for either side so far.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[RickMott: I would not pincer here.  You have a weak stone at C13; an extension toward it would probably be better.  The standard D6, or even C10 to make good shape.]
;B[cr]LB[nq:A][dr:B]C[RickMott: the standard response for Black to a close pincer is diving into the corner at C3.  However, in this case I would consider the double approach at C6, because of the weak white stone above.  This would start a complicated fight.  Too hard for me to read out, but I'd be worried about it as white.]

(;W[nq]C[[see variation\]

RickMott: I definitely would not tenuki here.  The fight in the lower left is not finished.  The issue is not the local fight, but what happens on the left side afterwards.  So the D2 cut probably isn't good, either.

Besides, the bottom is small.   You get a low, narrow extension on the 3rd line, and invite Black to make the natural extension along the wide-open right side.

It's OK if black lives small in gote in the lower left, as long as you get to reinforce your C13 stone.  Then black's four stones above it will look pretty silly.

I'd start with C4, which strengthens your 4-4 stone.  Then black has to choose; if he attacks C13, your corner cut is now much stronger.  If he lives in the corner, you defend on the left.  The way you're playing now, dropping stones in everywhere, you're bound to end up with a lot of weak groups.]
;B[pr];W[qc]C[Q: Have I invaded too early? What are the advantages/disadvantages of doing so?

RickMott: Yes.  It is rarely to your advantage to invade at the 3-3 until some stones have been played on the sides.  You give Black the freedom to aim a big wall on either side.

In this case, Black should choose to build his wall facing down the right side, which is his for the taking.  You can invade afterwards, because the joseki ends in white sente, but you will come under strong attack when you do.]
;B[pc]C[RickMott: Wrong side.  Black can't build a moyo easily on the top because you are out underneath in the upper right.]
;W[qd];B[pe]C[RickMott: mistake by Black.  He should push down to the 3rd line at R15.]
;W[qe];B[jd]C[RickMott: too far and too high.  The rule is a 4-space extension from a 3-high wall.  This is to your advantage so far, but you have to reinforce some of your weak stones.]
;W[pf]C[RickMott: This hane can't be bad, but...];B[of];W[pg]
C[RickMott: it ends in gote.];B[er]C[RickMott: Not the most important area.  Black has tried to claim the top, he should follow through by blocking at E17.  On the left, he should consider attacking C13 from the left side around C9.]
;W[hc]C[RickMott: Maybe a lttle too far.  A one-space jump to F17 is fine for white.  Black should play there to separate you.]
;B[ec]C[RickMott: You're lucky.  If Black plays F17 instead, you can't connect.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[fc];B[ea]C[RickMott: Don't know what Black was thinking here.]
;W[ed]C[RickMott: This worked out wonderfully well for you, but only because Black misplayed.  The game would be very different if Black had succeeded in separating you.]
;B[db];W[gb]C[Q: What do you think of this ko? Was it too risky to start it?

RickMott: Why play ko?  Just connect.  Black is in terrible shape.  He can't possibly make two eyes.]
;B[ec];W[jc]C[ RickMott: This is bad.  You should defend the double atari at F16, which starts to make the ko look almost feasible for black.]
;B[kc]C[RickMott: But black is too focused on his moyo and doesn't see it.]
;W[jb];B[kd]
(;W[eb]C[RickMott: Now you're stuck with fighting this ko; otherwise black can make one in the corner.  See variation.  But all of this could have been avoided if you had just filled E17 in the first place, back  at move 38.]
;B[cp]C[RickMott: This is a bad result for you in the lower left.  You allowed black to make 4 moves against your corner stone, and now it's a problem.]
;W[co];B[ec];W[bp];B[bb];W[eb]C[RickMott: You are almost forced to ignore whatever threat Black finds.]
;B[di]C[RickMott: This is not big enough.   You should take at F19 immediately, ending the ko and capturing the corner.

If black wants to capture C13, he has to invest more stones to do it.  If you get the pon-nuki in the lower left in return, you should be happy.]
;W[ck];B[ec]C[RickMott: Now you have a problem.];W[qq]C[RickMott: Pretty good, but black can afford to let you have Q2 if he gets the upper left corner in return.  He should just connect the ko now and capture your five stones.  That would be huge -- 30 point swing.  Nothing else on the board can compare.]
;B[pq];W[eb];B[pm];W[fa]C[RickMott: Good decision.];B[qp]C[RickMott: Overconcentrated.  The white stone isn't going anywhere.  Black should play around R10 to expand his territory and restrict yours.]
;W[cb]C[RickMott: this move is unnecessary.  Black cannot make two eyes even f you don't play.  R10 would be much better.  It is so important because it is valuable for both sides, in sente.]
;B[bi]C[RickMott: Very brave.  Black should be a bit concerned about the four stones above C13.]
;W[eg]C[RickMott: Good answer.];B[dg];W[df]C[RickMott: Wrong side.  If you atari at D12, you can follow up with your own wedge at C10 and it starts to look hard for black to live.]
;B[dh]C[Now black suddenly looks stronger on both sides of you, so...]

(;W[ee]C[you chicken out and let him live easily.

But should you?  Maybe you're strong enough to chase him.  See variation.]
;B[cf];W[ef];B[lq]LB[bg:B][cq:A]C[RickMott: You're rght, B is much better.  It's a 20+ point swing, plus you have an attack on the remaining black stones which suddenly don't have a base.]

(;W[cq]C[[see variation\]];B[bg];W[ae]C[RickMott: Good idea!]
;B[bf];W[qk]C[Q: Is W 74 as big as it seems? Was there any bigger move?

RickMott: No, this is excellent because it is a very valuable area for both sides.  It might be better to play one line above (R10) to keep sente, though.  Then you could help one of your weak stones on the bottom.]
;B[rl];W[rk];B[ql];W[pk];B[nk]C[RickMott: This move doesn't do much.  If black wants to take territory, he should consider something like N6.]
;W[go]C[ RickMott: This looks OK, but I might play a pincer at K3 against M3.  Then jump out into the center to restrict the growing black moyo in the lower right.  You can come back and attack the three stones after that, but now they aren't so important.]
;B[np]C[RickMott: too tight.  Black should do the same thing I suggested to you in reverse; play K3, threatening to push and cut through the knight's move, and then jump up to K6 to enlarge the bottom right.  The white stone cannot escape.]

(;W[ek]C[Q: I didn't like the result of this fighting on the left side (moves 83 and following). Do you have any suggestions on how to improve it?

RickMott: We'll go through the tactics, but first let's take a look a the whole board to see which are the important areas and how the game stands at the moment.

White has territory in the top left corner, the upper right side, and the lower left side.  Black has territory on the right side of the top edge, and the bottom right corner.

Where is the uncertainty?  In the bottom left.  Can black live or fight with sente, which you have just given him locally?  E9 is pretty much a pure territory move.  You can't kill the black group above it, and it puts no pressure on black's stones in the bottom left.

The game hinges on two big questions: (1) can you kill black's stones in the lower left, and take the whole corner? (2) how big will black's lower right moyo become?

Of these questions, the first is most important.  Black will have to make several moves to enlarge the lower-right moyo, but making his stones live in the bottom left will be worth at least a 25-point swing.

Look at the variations to see how the weaknesses in your surrounding stones can be exploited if black gets the first move.]

(;B[em];W[fm]C[RickMott:  A contact move against a weak stone is not a good idea.  Surround on a larger scale with G8 instead, or play to keep black separated with something like F5.]
;B[dl];W[el]C[RickMott: Terrible.  You must connect in response to a peep.]
;B[dk];W[dm];B[dj];W[cl]C[RickMott: No, give up C9 and play C7.  It's only a few points on the left side, you want to keep sente to attack the bottom left or reduce the bottom right.]
;B[cm];W[en];B[dn]C[RickMott: This is a bad tactical choice by black, locally.  If he just descends at B7, he captures your two stones and solidifies his territory on the left side.  You should connect underneath with B7 atari.]
;W[cn]C[RickMott:  Wrong atari.  You should connect underneath on the left side with B7.  You can still attack black's bottom stones.]
;B[em];W[pb];B[ob];W[dm];B[bm]C[RickMott: Black's life would have been a lot simpler if he just played here in the first place instead of starting a ko.]
;W[do]C[RickMott: Now black has to play to capture your two stones, and you have sente.  This isn't so bad for you, but you must use the sente well.]
;B[bl]
(;W[fi]C[RIckMott: Ok, this works to secure the wall also.]
;B[ir];W[hr]C[RickMott: I like the diagonal play at G2 better, because it reduces the eye space for the corner stones.]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[iq];B[ip]
(;W[in]C[RickMott:  Ouch.  This is a bad mistake.  Black will capture your three stones, connect out his corner stones, and make enormous territory on the bottom.  If you lost, this is why.

The critical point for both sides is K4.  If you play there, it's a 3-to-2 liberty fight.  See variation.]

(;B[jq]C[RickMott: bad for Black.  He should simply extend to K4, I think.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[jp]C[RickMott: Black misplayed, so you were lucky.  See variations for what could have happened.]
;B[kq];W[jo];B[js];W[id]C[RickMott: Ouch, you should play G2 to get 3 liberties, keep your stones alive, and attack the corner.]
;B[gr]C[RickMott: Black is happy.  This is worth at least 30 points.]
;W[ie];B[kf];W[jg];B[kg];W[jh];B[jj]C[RickMott: Good move by Black here to reduce you.]
;W[ij];B[ik]C[RickMott:  too greedy.  Black should just descend to K9.  He should be keeping his eye on expanding the lower right moyo.  You can cut and fight.]
;W[hj]C[RickMott: too passive.  Cut and fight, because you are locally much stronger.  You should either capture or come out with sente to make a big reduction of a black moyo.]

(;B[kh]C[RickMott: This is not so good for Black.  He should play, say, L6 instead.  See variation.]
;W[ji]C[RickMott: small move.  Reduce black's lower right!  Something like N6.]
;B[ki];W[jk];B[kj];W[il]C[RickMott: come straight down at K8.  black can't get away.]
;B[jl];W[hk];B[kk]C[RickMott: Also for Black, better to extend straight out to L8.]
;W[jm];B[kl];W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ni]
;W[mm];B[ll]C[RickMott: defending the moyo at O4 would be bigger for Black.]
;W[mo];B[oj];W[pj];B[pi];W[ph];B[qi];W[ok];B[nj];W[qh];B[ri]
;W[rh];B[ol];W[no]C[RickMott: Right area, but N4 is a little better.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[po];W[nm];B[nl];W[om]C[RickMott: This costs you sente, because when black connects it reduces your 9th line group to 3 liberties.  Then you must give up sente to capture the three black stones.

Better to keep sente with B3 (threaten to capture Black with B9 followup); then T8, also sente; then B2, then N4, then monkey jump to N19.  That's a lot of endgame points!]
;B[pl];W[rj];B[sk];W[si];B[ml]C[RickMott: Poor use of sente for black.  See previous sente move list.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[kb]C[RickMott: Monkey jump is better, but take the lower-left sente first.]
;B[lb];W[je];B[ke];W[ej];B[eh];W[fh];B[kp];W[ko];B[br]C[Q: How should I have replied here? B6? In the end, this lower-left/corner ended up by becoming neutral area... Was there a way white could keep it to himself?

RickMott: B6 is good because it is sente (if black doesn't reply, you capture 3 stones).  B2 was also sente for you, so you should have played it earlier.  It's not sente for black now; you should play B6, then ignore it and save Q18.]
;W[bq];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp];W[fo];B[bn]C[RickMott: You gave up several points here by not realizing that B6 is sente for you.]
