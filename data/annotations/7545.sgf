C[Hello, dear Reviewer!
Thank you in advance for taking your time to review this game!
In tnis game I played white and lost by 2,5 moku. I think, that whites main problem was the failed attack of the opponents weak group on the top and poor defence of the left moyo.
I've added some questions during the game, but will greatly appreciate any other suggestions.
Best wishes!

/Igor' (Crazyone)

P.S.: I'm not a native speaker, so I'm sorry for my bad english :(]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[lc]C[I like this move. White has both corners, and Black has invited you in, by playing on the 5th line. Black has weakness here now, while White is lighter.]
;B[nc];W[nd];B[mc];W[md];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[od];B[pb];W[ld]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[rb]C[I don't think this is needed, though I'm not certain.

This joseki (if it is joseki) turned out well for White.];W[qn]
C[This is the right idea, though you can't really expect Black to reply at o4. You could also play r7.]
;B[pf];W[pe]C[I think this exchange is too early and Black should save the option. There's no way you're going to play in that area yet. And it's conceivable that Black will later wish he could cut directly at q15.]
;B[ql]LB[on:B][nq:A][qq:C]C[Crazyone:
 In the game I played A, but result wasn't good - black builded strong group facing my wall.
So, what is the right move to fully use W's wall? What about B?
Or, maybe, just simply invade with C and leave black with r6 aji?

A is wrong because it gives Black the option of solidifying r8, and that completely neutralises your wall. C is wrong because Black plays r4 and again your wall is neutralised (because r6 is so much weaker than r8). B is best (of the three options at least!) because it keeps the pressure on the weak stone, r8.]
(;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[This is a great move by Black. If r8 gets settled, your wall loses most of its value.]
;W[qq]C[This lacks fighting spirit. It invites Black to surround you in sente. q5 and q7 are far more interesting. I think with this move, you concentrate too much on making quick profit in the corner. But the corner is just not that big.]
;B[qo]C[This is one good option. I also think q3 would turn out okay for Black.]
;W[pq];B[iq]C[Crazyone:
I think, this result doesn't good for W. Am I right?

Yes. Black neutralised your wall, and in sente.];W[cn];B[co]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[dj]C[This is nice. There is definitely still invasion potential at c3.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[de]
(;B[cd]TR[fc][jd]C[Crazyone:
Now the main question of the game: what is the best way for W to attack B's weak stones?
I wanted to use p16 group and build some moyo on the left, but something went wrong and my territory was quite modest.

I think Black was alive without this move. See if you can prove me wrong.

Yes, those two stones are the most interesting. Take a moment to look at the whole board. Black has most of the secure territory. You need to act on a large scale to win. You are right that those two stones are the focus. Black will play l18 as soon as possible, so keep that in mind. Also your top right group is still without eyes. I think you have many options for putting great pressure on those stones: l14, k10, k14, q9. These are all real options.]
;W[ff]C[Doesn't attack enough, nor does it defend the cut well enough, as explained later.]
;B[fd]
(;W[no]C[Crazyone:
 ladderbraker for d14 cut. But wasn't it better to  simply extend to f13?

If you need a ladder breaker, then f14 was wrong. But I don't think you do. See variation. Also, locally this is not a good move! Something like k10 would be much better!]
;B[op]
(;W[oq]C[No. You should play o4. Or at least n2. Or at least n3.]
;B[np]
(;W[mq]C[This isn't needed. It makes two points of territory and doesn't really threaten anything. Also, I think n4 is locally better.]
;B[mp]C[This is not a good exchange. You are already alive. Don't play n3. Don't get distracted like this just because the last move was in this area. You should attack the stones at the top!]
(;W[gh]C[This is weak. It doesn't attack. It just makes territory, but that was really already yours! Try k14 instead. It's a far more interesting move. This is really a wasted move at a crutial time.

I have to re-emphasise: this is probably your worst move so far. If you want moyo, play g6 or g7.]
;B[fj]LB[hc:A][eh:B][fn:C]C[Crazyone:
 In the game I tried to play actively (A)
B looked overconcentrated for W.
I have found C after the game.
What do you think about this moves?

B is not even an option! Let's think strategically. What should your strategy be here? Well, Black has just volunteered to make another weak group. But Black already has a weak group (around A). So strategically, you want to attack both. In this case, the move that seems obvious for that purpose is h10...]
(;W[hc]C[This is a bit early...]
(;B[fb];W[fa]C[Generally e19 is best.];B[ga];W[ea];B[hb]C[Now if Black captures h17, he will easily have two eyes. If you'd just played e19, Black might still only have one eye.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[he];B[ib];W[kb];B[ie];W[hd];B[jb]
(;W[jg]C[Crazyone:
maybe h14 was enough for W? If B runs, W can hope to gain some central thikness and attack f10.

I prefer j12. k13 tries too hard to enclose. But there is not that much weakness at h14 either.]
;B[ge]
(;W[hf];B[gf];W[gg];B[fg];W[ef];B[if];W[ig]C[My god, Black is killing himself.]
;B[kf]C[Crazyone:
The safe way is to play e12 and then hope to get f16, but inn's it to soft for k16 group?]
;W[kg];B[lf]
(;W[ng]C[Crazyone:
suddenly p16 became quite weak. I couldn't find better moves, so B run out :(

o14 is the better move.];B[mg]
(;W[oh]C[This move doesn't make sense to me. Everything else seems better. p14... n12...]
;B[mh];W[oj];B[nh];W[og];B[nf];W[of];B[ei];W[di];B[eh]
(;W[dg]C[This might not be needed. Also, locally d12 is better (it takes away a liberty).]
;B[gm]LB[ig::(]C[Crazyone:
And now W, not B, is under attack. n10 looked too dangerous, so I passively played l10 and B run out.
So, again, I'll be happy to know, where was I wrong during the last 50 moves?

You should notice the strength of k14.

I think h10 threatens capture of some stones.

If you force with those two moves, n10 might be good.]

Does e2 instead of d2 works for W?

I think, that the last part of the game doesn't deserve your attention.
