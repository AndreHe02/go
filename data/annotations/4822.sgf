-------------------------

Hi Kilroy!

Thanks for sending this game for review, I'll try my best to point out your mistakes (and good plays, too, of course) and spot points where you could improve.

Please note that I'm only ranked somewhere between 1-kyu and 1-dan myself, so everything I say might seem utterly stupid to a stronger player and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Be sure not to miss the variations I give along the way and check the summary at the end of the .sgf file.
To distinguish my comments from yours, I preceded them with "fey:".

If you have any further questions, don't share my opinion on a certain point or want to discuss anything else about the game, feel free to send me an e-mail. I'm also keen to hear which points of the review you liked and where I could improve something.

Well, let's start with the game now :)

Best wishes, 

Nadja Sommerfeld

The review was done with great support from Hwang InSeong 7-dan, whom I'd like to thank for his kindness and patience in teaching and reviewing, teaching and reviewing, teaching and... lots of ninuki games! :D]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq]C[dinghy05 [7k\]: good morning in Hiroshima Japan]
;W[dp]C[kilroy [7k\]: good afternoon from Rochester Hills, United States]
;B[oc];W[qi]SQ[qk]C[should I pressure this stone or go on with F3?

fey: Surely there's no definite 'right' answer here. Mainly this is a matter of style, but if I played Black, I'd want to put a little pressure on R11 first before switching to a new kakari.
(see the variations)

We also have to consider that R11 is not a common move. Sure, splitting the right side is a very common and good strategy in this kind of position, but a move more frequently used here is R9, as it relates closer to Black's komoku in the lower right. (Note that it is also the vital point in the chinese fuseki, there are similarities here.)
I won't state that as absolute, but in my database, I didn't find a single professional player playing R11. Maybe this is a hint that R11 lacks a bit efficiency, so Black should try to think about a way to exploit this.

Another common strategy that is more old-fashioned follows the idea to deny Black his second shimari so early in the opening, so White could also consider an approach move at Q5, too.
In modern go, though, White gets komi, so he can afford to give Black profit early on.

Still, tenuki is also good - if you don't know how to handle R11 yet, it's good strategy to see first how other parts of the board develop.
Certainly not a mistake, but somehow it misses the important area of play.]

(;B[fq]C[dinghy05 [7k\]: Hello,I'm half asleep];W[ip]SQ[pq]
[dn]C[kilroy [7k\]: i know what that feels like

fey: With the marked black stone in place, pinering is not so common here and feels a bit greedy. Q3 is low, making the bottom an uninteresting area - White has no good kakari compared to the position where Black's komoku is on R3.
Black, on the other hand, has more potential at the bottom. By trying to deny Black to build anything there, White can't hope to get a good result if Black plays correctly.
White's potential is on the left side, so he plays D6 in most cases to develop it.

When Black plays F5 next, White gets to play this point, too, so maybe Black could try one of his other options here: I'd propose to simply enter the corner at san-san. (var.)

But mind that this is not inferior for White and might only cause him to be at a slight disadvantage locally.]

(;B[fo]C[fey: Also a possible way to play.];W[dn];B[dr]
(;W[po]SQ[ip]C[fey: This tenuki is an interesting idea, but it may be advisable for White to complete the joseki in the lower left first (he ends in sente anyway) before playing here. This way, J4 is not so much of a light stone as it would be with D2-C3 and J2 already on the board, plus, D4 and D6 remain quite weak.
Black is presented with a chance here.]
(;B[oo]C[fey: I don't quite like this move.
The idea behind it is correct: Build strenght along the bottom to attack J4. The reason why P5 still isn't appropriate here is that White's position on the left is not yet strong. Black might later be able to exploit the thinness of the Q5-R11 formation, and so it only helps White to choose a joseki that strenghtens both sides.
P5 just solidifies White too much.
Just as effective and more flexible, not settling everything on the right side yet, is bO4. (see the variation, please.)]
;W[on];B[op]
(;W[pn]SQ[nn][pm]C[fey: A joseki mistake by White. The correct moves instead are Q7 and O6. (I'll give some continuations in the vars.)
Q6 lacks efficiency, it neither has a great effect on R11 (as Q7 would), nor does it increase White's influence. 
Locally, R4 is a good follow-up move for Black now, but I agree with you that attacking on the left is more important now.]

(;B[kp]C[fey: The direction of this move feels right, but the following moves lack a consistent strategy.]
;W[in];B[fm]C[fey: A very good move! The vital point for both attack and defense.]
;W[cq]SQ[dk]C[fey: This White answer is not good, White should rather play at the marked point to avoid being shut in in the corner.
C3 may be a big move, but it's strategically off the mark. Advancing to the center ahead of Black is much more important for White.
Plus, D8 becomes a very nice attacking move for Black - you should play it as soon as possible.]

(;B[kn]C[how to attack J4 better, or better, when does my attack become bad?

fey: This might be the worst move of the whole attacking sequence.
Ask yourself what this accomplishes:
L6 doesn't gain you points.
L6 makes it easy for White to get out into the center and thereby get rid of all his worries.
L6 attacks from the wrong direction and lets your attack run out of steam.

You absolutely have to play as in the variation, attacking with J8.]
;W[il];B[ir]LB[dl:!!!]C[fey: This move is not good, too. It's very painful for Black to play a move like this so early, and J2 is a very passive and uninspired play.
You don't have to be afraid to be attacked here, remember that Black can and should play D8 as soon as possible to put pressure on White.
By getting out like this, Black also strenghtens his stones and White will be reluctant to jump down to J2.

L6 has already made the position bad for Black - J2 makes it even worse by giving White the chance to extend on the left side, getting rid of his main weakness.]
;W[ck]C[fey: D9 would be another possibility, but White shows good intuition here. White is already leading.]
;B[iq]LB[iq:1][ip:2][ir:3]C[fey: And yet another move that shows an unnecessary fear and fails to improve Black's overall position.

You have to be more confident; as long as you play  moves like J2 and J3, improving will be hard for you because you simply lose too much by playing quasi-passing moves in the fuseki and middle game.

Just try tewari (changing move order) in this position: If Black had played at 1 somewhen, then you surely wouldn't descend to 3 if White attached at 2, would you?

Ban moves of this kind from your game, except from very rare cases. Always ask yourself the following questions if you intend to play them:

1) How endangered is my group? Is it really necessary to defend on the second line yet? Is there still the possibility of running out or counterattacking somehow? Maybe even tenuki is ok?

2) If I have to defend after all, is it at least big to link up? Can I secure territory by playing there or can I help another weak group to become stable?

3) Is there a way to defend that forces my opponent to defend, too and keeps sente for me?]
;W[qq]C[fey: Again White shows a good understanding of the position. This exchange is important because it forestalls bR4 and indirectly protects White's weak point on the right side.]
;B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[fc]LB[de:A][ic:B]SQ[jd][kc]C[fey: You are correct to approach D17 from this side, but G16 would be a better move here.
After the A-B exchange in the game, Black is still low on the upper side. Later White can, depending on the overall situation, either press at K16 or invade somewhere around L17.
Black's stones on the top don't from a very efficient shape, please see the variation for a more pleasant result for Black.]
;W[de];B[ic];W[qf]C[fey: A good move!];B[ld]SQ[oe]C[fey: The key point here is P15 instead of your move. White should immediately punish Black's mistake and play there himself.

M16 tries to patch up the shape problems Black has on the upper side, but in fact it is not so efficient in doing this.
If White is strong enough on the outside, he can later invade somewhere under M16. depending on the outside, even simply pressing at K16 might be enough.

Please check the var. on White P15, too.]
(;W[mn]C[fey: As stated above, this should be at P15, while being a nice point in itself.]
;B[kl]C[fey: A spirited, good move which I quite like.];W[lo]
C[fey: This white move is not good, Black shouldn't be afraid and simply connect. As far as I can see, there's not much White can do. (var.)]

(;B[lp]C[fey: Don't let your opponent intimidte you. This move gives away too much, you shouldn't give White the L5 cut.]
;W[mp];B[mq];W[rr]C[fey: This move is not important right now. It's too small for White to play there and likewise it's too small for Black to answer at Q2.]
;B[pr];W[ko];B[jo];W[jp];B[ln]C[fey: Black should just connect at K6 without giving atari. M5 forces White to connect and loses the atari on N4 if White later hanes at O3.
This is a fatal mistake - all of Black's lower right corner stones are on the verge of death now.]
;W[mo];B[jn];W[nq]C[fey: Ouch >__<];B[mr];W[nr];B[lq]
(;W[np]C[fey: Actually White even missed a chance here to capture the M3 stones, too. See the variation, please.]
;B[ml];W[oe]C[fey: Finally White spotted P15! A very nice move, and I'd daresay that Black shouldn't tenuki here as he does in the game - the reasons were given in some earlier variation.]
;B[pj]C[fey: Black is already in a difficult situation, I understand why you feel that you can't afford protecting at P16 now.
This moves shows flexibility in thinking, very nice - but still the game is tough for Black.]

(;W[nj]C[fey: This is a big overplay on White's part, simply answering at R10 is enough and much better than the result of the game.]
;B[qj];W[ok]SQ[io]C[fey: White is being very greedy here, following up his first overplay with another one. Black should have no trouble living or connecting here.
In the meantime, though, J5 for White becomes more and more threatening for Black, so you should be careful there.]

(;B[ri]SQ[qh]C[fey: This move lets White extend to R12 and is maybe not the best choice. Did you think about R12 instead?]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[rl];B[qg];W[pg];B[rg];W[ph]C[fey: Black came out well here because you managed to nicely refute White's overplay. :)
Just as a minor detail, White shouldn't exchange Q12 for S14 yet. This is aji keshi and settles things too early. Maybe White rather wants to play S14 himself in some later stage of the game. As he doesn't know which move - Q12 or S14 - will be more useful for him, he shouldn't play either for the time being.]
;B[rf];W[lc]TR[qi][qh][ph][pg][qf][oe]C[fey: This again is an overplay when we bear in mind the fact that White's marked group is still quite weak.
Black should simply answer with N17 here.];B[md]C[fey: This is certainly solid, but a bit mild in this case.]
;W[mc];B[nc]C[fey: Of course L17 is better for Black here, White will have a very tough time living then.]
;W[kd];B[kc]
(;W[jc]C[fey: This is a rather crude move. Atari is one of the simplest techniques in go, one of the most direct ones, but not always the best one.
If you watch the games of low kyu players you'll notice that they haste from atari to atari, settling everything right away for the single reason that atari was *possible*.
Dan players, on the contrary, usually like to play more indirect tactics that keep their possibilities open as long as possible.

A move that poses real problems to Black here is shown in the variation.]
;B[kb];W[jd];B[jb];W[id];B[hc]C[fey: A series of bad moves from W that only solidify Black's territory and gain White close to nothing.]
;W[gn]C[kilroy [7k\]: mouse died, so if i play N9 it's a misclick
dinghy05 [7k\]: O,K];B[fn];W[gp];B[gq]TR[jo][jn][kn][ln][ml]
[kl][gp][gn]C[fey: With the two markes stones, White played a nice combination, helping his weak stones and delivering a heavy blow to Black's markes group which really looks dead now.

But why didn't you protect you cutting point at F4? It's a very big move and there's no danger that White can cut your group in two if you don't play G3. What were you afraid of?]
;W[hk]C[where do I go from here?

fey: The ko seems to be the best solution locally, and of course F4 is big, too.
Sad as it sounds, it seems already far too late for Black to turn the game around.]
;B[io];W[ho];B[im];W[hm];B[hn];W[qe];B[re];W[in];B[oi];W[jm]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[mg];W[lh];B[ng]C[fey: M13 is the only move for Black here, your O13 is just much too shy!]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[kf];B[mf]C[fey: Also very passive, the White stones are just plain dead, there's not even aji left that you'd have to be afraid of.]
;W[jg];B[gf];W[jq]C[fey: This is a very big double sente endgame, Black should have played here before.]
;B[jr];W[eg]SQ[gf]C[fey: A good move, very calm and played with respect to the whole board. Going mad and trying to cut G14 off would do White no good.]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[pl];W[nm];B[gh];W[ei]C[fey: Another patient move by White, very nice.]
;B[dj]C[fey: I'm sure you know yourself that this is overplay if Black plays correctly. ;)]
;W[el];B[dh];W[eh];B[cj]
(;W[dg];B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[ch]C[fey: But even now Black is still dead: White should play at the vital point of B11 first, denying Black two eyes.]

(;W[cg];B[bi]C[fey: You were lucky here :D];W[bg];B[di]SQ[db]
[hi][cr][fp]C[fey: Even though Black's group on the left somehow managed to live, the game is virtually over, White is leading by a big margin of points.

The biggest endgame points now are marked in this diagram.

fey: This game ended by a depressingly big difference in points. Especially in the beginning, Black was certainly outplayed by White, who's opening is much better than 7-kyu. When we were reviewing the game together, InSeong commented that some of White's moves in the earlier stage of the game equalled dan moves.
After Black failed to attack White's weak group from the right direction, the game started to look bad for him and White played clever and calm moves to not let you upset his lead.
In middle game stage, White wasn't as dominating as in the opening, for example, the whole marked forcing sequence only lost him points and helped Black.
But it was already too late for Black to make a comeback.

Most of your serious mistakes seem to result from fear and a lack of confidence in your reading. I know this quite well from some of my own games, but it's a habit we have to get rid of in order to become stronger. 
Maybe a book an tesuji will help you to improve your reading, "Golden Opportunitys" by Rin Kaiho for example has some very surprinsing things in it and also "Tesuji" from the Elementary Go Serious is not so much a beginner's book as it sounds.

The second kind of your main mistakes bases on strategy. Throughout the game, I felt that sometimes you lacked a consistent plan even though you had the right idea. The most striking example for this was your unlucky attack gainst White's weak stones on the lower side; but also the F17 kakari fits into this category.
There are many ways to improve strategy and intuition, among them are replaying pro games and reading books such as "501 Opening Problems", "Direction or Play" or "Attack and Defense"over and over again until you mastered the tactics they describe.

All in all I can only give you one advice: Play more calmly. Be confident in what you play and always think about the strong, resisting, stubborn move first. Passive moves should never appear to you on first thought, they should only be played if they are absolutely necessary.
Never light-heartedly sacrifice stones that could easily live. Being willing to give something up is good, but one shouldn't overdo things. ;)


Another thing: Thanks that you went over the game by yourself, adding comments. It really helps a lot when you review. 
But usually, games that weren't lost by such a big margin are more suitable for a GTL review, usually that are the games where you don't know just where you lost this one point that cost you the game. Experience tells that those games are most instructive and give the reviewer the chance to point out real mistakes rather than stupid reading mistakes that happen to everyone of us.

Well, I hope this review doesn't sound too harsh, but there's always more to comment on bad plays than on good ones. Another problem with this game is that White is most possibly not 7-kyu, at least certainly not in the opening.
I hope you felt that you could benefit from some of my pointers and found the review useful.

I wish you many successful games in the future!
