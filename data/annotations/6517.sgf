C[Hi, I've been playing go for about 3 months. In this game, I played white. If I was able to kill the 3-3 invasion in the lower left corner I probably would have won by a much larger margin. Please let me know whenever I could have played better moves throughout the game.

Thank You,
Jeremy W

Daedin: Hello Jeremy,

Before you start reading the comments I added throughout the game, please let me ramble a few seconds on how to get the best of a game review.
What is a game review by the way ? Why do I ask for one ? The thing that immediately comes to mind is of course to know what I did wrong. And to know this, I need to ask a stronger player.
However, you will be surprised how much you can discover mistakes yourself in your own games. When playing, I am usually too caught in the action to clearly spot out obvious mistakes. However, after the game has finished - and with the outcome in mind - I am usually able to discover mistakes.

And if you do this, you will not only discover flaws in your own game - which is usually much more fruitful than having someone point them out for you - but the reviewer will be able to comment on not only your style and moves, but also on your way of thinking. Why did you do this ? What had Black in mind when he made a wall instead of living underneath ? And so on, and so on.


All in all, my advise is: review your own game first, as if it were someone else's ! With this in mind, I hope that my comments will prove useful :)]

;B[gd];W[dg]C[Daedin: Until wD13, this is a standard joseki. D13 is however usually played at C14.

The reason is difficult to explain clearly. To put it simply, wit C14 the corner is solid with only one move. With D13, there is still a weakness at C15 that black may use later on if a fight develops in the area - for instance, a Black play around C11 becomes an attack against the White group.]
;B[cl]C[Daedin: This moves seems to be dual purpose - both attacks the corner and the White group at the top. However, it is too far from the corner to be a threat, and too far from the White group.

Moreover, it induces a White move at D6 that strengthen the corner while attacking the Black stone.

Other possibilities for Black could have been around R12 or F3.]
;W[cn];B[ci]C[Daedin: Here we see that D13 is a bit loose; it D13 were at C14, White could simply tenuki.]

(;B[dk]C[Daedin: F9 would have been more severe.]
(;W[qn];B[fk]C[Daedin: This cuts White in two, and destroys the shape of the group; E8 seems a little out of place now.

However, it is very huge to let White double approch the corner.]
;W[gj]C[Daedin: Here White should take the opportunity to use Black's tenuki with something around O3]
;B[fm];W[en]C[Daedin: White doesn't really have anything to gain right now from chasing the Black group. I'd rather go to a double approach at O4 or O3.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[gm];W[ho];B[mq];W[kp]C[Daedin: The sequence let Black defend the corner in sente.]
