RR:  Comments by Richard Rulmey begin with  "RR:"
JM:  Comments by Jeff Murphy begin with "JM:"

RR:  Jeff and I have played dozens and dozens of  games together over  the years via email.  This is  one we played recently.  Jeff is White,  and I am  black. Because we play via email, my moves lack  consistancy, and sometimes I try something  because I'm too busy at work to really think about  all the possibilities. In this game, I thought I was  doing pretty well, but I lost by 7.5 points.  I'd like  somebody to look at this, and tell me where my  thinking was wrong.
-------------------------------------
I see you both made comments on the game so I'll  make comments on both w & b. It may surprise you  to learn that b 226 was the loosing move :). But  we'll get there soon enough. I hope you enjoy the  comments and let me know what you think.

Goran (GS)];B[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[pp];W[kc];B[df]C[RR:  Jeff is good about making large territories, and  I have a hard time invading or reducing.  So I go  against his corner right away, rather than making a  san-ran-sei (please forgive my spelling.)

GS: My spelling is even worse :). San-ren-sei would  be preferable, although w 3 was a slow move and  this is an interesting way to try and punish it.]
;W[dh]LB[dh:7][fd:A]C[GS: This pincer does not exist as a joseki - so you  must not play it unless there are other  circumstances that make it a good move. In 99% of  the cases you should calmly play at A directly.]
;B[ff];W[gc];B[cd];W[dc]LB[dc:11][dj:A]C[GS: Black could play at A next making the pincer  stone looke completly wasted. The game  continues in a different way because black goes for  the corner which is not bad, just a bit more  complex.]
;B[cc];W[ce];B[de];W[be];B[db];W[eb];B[bb];W[da];B[cb]
(;W[bd]LB[bd:21][fd:A]C[GS: White really needs to cover his weakness by  playing at A. See var.]

(;B[ec]C[GS: See var.];W[ed];B[fc];W[fd];B[fb];W[fa];B[gb]C[GS: Take the ko first. That way b 28 is a local ko  threat.]
;W[hb];B[ea];W[gd];B[ga]LB[ga:32][cg:A][ic:B]C[RR:  White got the better of this exchange.  (I think it  could have been worse for black!)

JM:  Not sure I played well, but White is happy with  a small Black corner that's completely isolated,  outside influence and 3 stones to attack.

GS: You guys paint a grim picture for black :). The  most important point on the board is A. White must  take it on the next move. This will enable black  stones to jump in the center into relative safety.  Another good point for black is B which attacks the  top. This means that as soon as black group gets a  bit stronger white will have to act on the top.]
;W[hf]
(;B[dj]C[RR:  I play as though the three stones are dead.   Trying to save them at this point would be very  hard, and make white very strong.  Is this wrong?

GS: As wrong as it can be. Those stones are cutting  stones since white group on the left is not safe yet.  See var.]
;W[cg]C[GS: And so black misses an oportunity.];B[fi];W[ei]
;B[ej];W[eg];B[fj]C[RR:  I play to have no cutting points, and strength  pointing to my star point stones.  Although I feel a  bit high.  I wish these three stones were on the 3rd  line instead of the 4th.

GS: They are better positioned on the 4th line! This  game is still very good for black.]
;W[fg];B[jp]C[RR.  Two opposing walls.  Is this the correct side?

GS: Superb point!];W[qf];B[nc]C[RR:  I don't know Joseki, but I figured that a pincer  here would be bad for my Q16 stone.  O17 felt safe.

GS: It's the correct move.];W[pj];B[cq]LB[cq:46][fp:A][lc:B]
C[RR:  As I look back at this move, it seems way too  slow.

JM:  The problem seems to me that you can't just  leave Q16 the way it is at this point.

GS: b 46 is to slow and would be better invested at  A. Q16 is completly safe at the moment as white  stone is one space further. If it was at B a stronger  attack would be possible. Even then black would  have little problems accessing the center.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[pb];B[ob]C[JM:  I think once you've played S18, you're  committed to R18 here instead ...

GS: b 52 is correct.];W[qb]
(;B[pc]C[GS: b 54 however is wrong. See var.];W[ra]C[GS: So white gets away with it again.]
;B[ne];W[le]C[JM:  O15 seems wrong, since it lets me play here,  which looks very good for White.

GS: w 57 is not that big as it simply makes territory  from an already strong group.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[mg]LB[mg:60][lb:A][mb:B][lc:C]C[GS: Instead of building whites center it would be  better for black to make life with a move like A-C.]
;W[qn]LB[qn:61][on:A][np:B][pn:C]C[RR:  I now feel that White has the entire right side.   What could be done here?

JM:  We'll see what the reviewer says :-) but as
Black I'd expand the bottom moyo instead of going
after the right side ... maybe P6 or K8 or even
just N3 or R4.

GS: JM is correect. Moves like A-C come to mind  which are all very good for black. As for the right  side - it is better to reduce it from above then to  invade. (Naturally this depends on how strong/weak  w 61 gets as the game progresses)]
;B[pl]C[GS: This is an overplay.];W[on];B[np];W[ql]LB[ql:65]
[qk:A][mn:B]C[GS: This leaves aji at black A so perhaps another  jump at B would be better for white.]
;B[lg]C[GS: A good turn. Moves like these are much  stronger then they look.]
;W[gp];B[jn]LB[jn:68][en:A][gn:B]TR[pl]C[JM:  This seems way too easy on the G4 stone to  me.

GS: Don't you just wish you had a black stone at the  marked white stone? White stone is in too deep so  black must find a way to punish it. b 68 doesn't look  severe enough. Black A would be the usual idea to  secure territory while attacking. Black B would be a  standard capping play to drive white to the center  and to get black triangle marked stone to start  working.

All in all I'd say black still has a good position and  it depends on how well he does in the attack.]
;W[hn];B[iq]C[RR: First, keep white separated, then take away the  base. Try to put my C3 stone to work somehow!

GS: A good idea to take away the base. C3 is  working in a way as it prevents white from dodging  into corner or putting pressure on the black hoshi  stone from the outside.]
;W[dm]
(;B[fm]C[GS: See var.];W[eo]C[GS: Very good!];B[ep];W[fo];B[cn]
;W[cm]LB[cm:77][hl:A]C[GS: It would be better to jump lightly at A.]

C[GS: Black A is much faster.];W[fn];B[gm];W[hm];B[em];W[gn]
;B[fq]LB[fq:94][kk:A]TR[pl]C[GS: It would be better to try and contain white with A  while keeping an eye on the marked stone.]
;W[kk]C[GS: My enemy's vital point is my own :).];B[mk]C[RR:  Keep white on the run.

GS: Good. Although white has more space for action  now.];W[jj]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[ih];W[io];B[jo];W[gq]
(;B[fr]C[GS: See var.];W[ip];B[mn]C[GS: Black again leaves the battlefield to early.]
;W[hq]C[JM:  RR comments later on H5, but I move here
because my second eye is a play at H5, or I can
still run/make a 2nd eye in the center depending
on how the center plays out. I was thinking this
at this point in the game.];B[ir];W[lo]C[JM:  Just a probe.

GS: This costs points.];B[mo];W[kq];B[jq]LB[jq:11][oq:A]C[GS: Why not at something like A?]
;W[nr];B[pr]LB[pr:11][oq:A]C[JM:  This seemed too loose to me. Thoughts?

GS: It's safer to play at A but even this is o.k.];W[mq]

C[GS: And so white lives. With so many errors on  blacks part it is interesting to note black doesn't  look bad at all. This just shows how unresonable  whites invasions were!

See var.]
(;B[di]LB[di:13][ci:A][bi:B][qk:C]C[GS: This would be better at A or B. See var. about  invading the right side at C.]
;W[ci];B[eh];W[hg];B[gg];W[gf];B[gh];W[dg];B[bn]C[RR:  I know there is a nice tseuji around here, I just  couldn't figure it out!

JM:  I don't see it - I thought I was always
connected.

GS: I think I pointed it out a while back but now  white is connected.]
;W[kg]LB[kg:14][pk:A]C[JM:  Important move! Solidify the top and
threaten to connect in the middle.

GS: It would be better for white to play A. The top is  not as big as the right.]
;B[kh];W[jg];B[jh]C[JM:  Now the middle is cut off, so ...]
;W[ho]C[RR:  I missed this move in the real game.  I saw it about the same time White did.
JM:  This was my safety valve. And Black K12 makes it
big now.];B[pm]LB[pm:14][qm:A]C[GS: Too small as white can connect at A.]
;W[pn]C[GS: This way white throws the lead away.];B[qk];W[nn]
;B[no];W[qm];B[pk];W[rp];B[ro]C[JM:  This looks wrong to me - S9 would force White
to live in the corner (yeah, Black might lose a few
points there), but allow Black free access up the   right side!

GS: This move is o.k.];W[qo];B[rq];W[qp];B[qq];W[rk]C[GS: Since white still has to hane on this side.]
;B[rj];W[sl];B[sp]LB[sp:16][qj:B]C[RR:  I forgot about the cut at R10...  I was thinking  KILL .. KILL .. KILL.

GS: Yup. Black could connect at B in sente  (demolishing the right side). That way black wins!]
;W[qj]C[JM:  White sighs in relief ;-)];B[oj]C[RR:  Now whites side seems very large to me.  Since I lost by 7.5, if I can reduce this, maybe I have a  better shot at winning?]
;W[oi];B[ok];W[pi];B[qg]C[GS: Good!];W[pf];B[oh];W[pg];B[ph]
;W[qh];B[ni];W[qi];B[kb]C[GS: Black making excellent progress now!]
;W[lc]LB[lc:17][jb:A]C[GS: Should be at A.];B[ib];W[ic];B[jc]

;W[nm];B[kl];W[rn];B[qe];W[re]C[GS: And here the fun starts :). W 205 should be one  point lower.]

(;B[pe]C[GS: See var!];W[of]LB[of:20]TR[qg]C[GS: If only black extended from the triangled stone.  That move would not cost a point and would expose  the bad aji white has around here.]
;B[nf];W[lh];B[mh];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[gi]LB[gi:21][dl:A]C[GS: A is much bigger.]
;W[do];B[co];W[ac];B[ab];W[cj];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[so];B[sq]
;W[md];B[oe]C[GS: So this is the final loosing move :).

The main points I wish to impress upon you two.

1. Remember how white invaded blacks mojo and  black made so many errors? Even then black did  not fall behind. This means that those invasions  were not successful but rather unresonable.
2. Be on the lookout for vital points. When you see  a good point for your opponent check if it is a good  point for you. It usually is!
3. When making a sacrifice, make it bigger. Learn  how to force the opponent to take stones. Extending  a stone from atari means you have 3 liberties  instead of 1 and that means your opponent will  have to play 3 stones to capture them instead of 1.  In this game black would even be able to capture  white first.
4. It's easy to become short of liberties in the  corner so you need to read deeper in corners (like  the upperright fight).

I hope you found my comments usefull and perhaps   you will even improve a bit because of them.  Thanks for listening!
