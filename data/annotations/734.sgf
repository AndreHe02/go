C[Comments by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 2d, for the GTL in January 1999.]
;B[dp]C[I playded white.];W[qd];B[dc];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd]
;W[dg];B[fc];W[ck];B[pp];W[oc]LB[pj:A][qn:B]C[EE: Black's low and solid shape in the upper left has decreased the value
of the upper side. Therefore, moves like Q10 (a) and R6 (b) might be
more interesting, contrary to the general rule: first shimari, then
extension.];B[pj];W[jq];B[cm];W[ek]C[Should I ignore B15 and play an extension from the shimari at the right side myself?

During the whole game I thought myself to be behind.

EE: Those are the right moves to chose from, but I can't say which is the most
urgent one.  By playing D15 to start with, you have accepted giving Black
some early profit (three corners) in exchange for outside influence. E9 is
a move with the same attitude. In theory, the profit and influence should be
worth about the same, but hen there is the question of using the influence to
100%, which can be easier in theory than practise! :-)];B[qf]
;W[pm]LB[qh:A][ql:B][qn:C][qq:D][gq:E][nq:F]C[I think that´s the beginning of the end! But I´m worried the black moyo will become too big.

EE: This is the first questionable move of the game. Since Black has sente moves
against k3, q7 might be hard pressed. The rule is: "not more than one weak group
on the board."

There are many invasion points on the right: r12 (a), r8 (b), r6(c) and r3 (d). Black
can't protect all of them in one move. Play g3 (e) and look how he answers -THEN
you invade!

Or another idea: start with o3 (f).];B[qn]C[EE: Dubious shape. White will answer r7 and r6 will be a weak stone. n3, then
r5 looks better for black.];W[nq]C[EE: R7 is very urgent! A black move there and he is connected and has lots
of territory and his r6 is turned into an excellent move.];B[pq]
C[EE: r7.];W[ql]C[EE: Still big, but R7 is firmer; either you will have s6 to look forward to, or
you will get sente if he replies.];B[no];W[nl];B[hq];W[lp]C[EE: Good!]
;B[io];W[ln];B[em]
(;W[rj]C[First I should play on the upper side, shouldn´t I?

EE: This is too soft. Remember, you have a lot more stones on the right
side then black, so you must play aggressively: invade at r12 or q12 (variation)!
I feel Black is leading now (white's extra influence doesn't balance black's profit.]
;B[mc];W[od]TR[rj]C[I know: it´s too slow! I should play at p15 or o15, shouldn´t I?

EE: Agree. P15 is more threatening to the weak black stones on the right,
so it seems the better of the two. Because of the two slow marked moves,
black can sacrifice his stones on the right with a light heart. It may
not be easy for white to capture them efficiently.];B[jd];W[of]
;B[mf]
(;W[fe]C[EE: This is a difficult situation. #36 is not a bad direction, but considering
black's next move, which is annoying for white, I suggest you play as in the variation.]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[ph];B[qi]LB[mi:A]C[EE: Greedy. Black should be satisfied with protection the cutting point with
n11 (a). R11 will be sente later, or if white defends, black gets next move.
No need to confuse things when you are ahaed.];W[ni]LB[ng:A]
C[I think, I should above 37, because the stones around 18 become weaker and the black tortoise shell is to big.

EE: A looks safer, but #42 is probably possible even if the fighting will
be difficult. O11 is the severer move of the two. Severe moves can be good
when you are behind. :-)];B[nj];W[mi];B[mj];W[ng]LB[li:A]C[EE: A is the pivotal point. I would play there immediately. Hard to decide if
playing o13 first is a gain or a loss.];B[mh];W[mg]C[EE: Ouch! This was white's last chance to pull out at m11.]
;B[li]C[EE: Giving away cutting stones is almost always very bad.
Black gets VERY THICK, meaning he controls the whole board and that o8 and
m6 are severely weakened. It is inconceivable for white to catch up now.]
;W[lg];B[ge];W[cq]C[the black corner seems too big.

EE: Good, but there is nothing big enough.];B[dq];W[bp];B[bl]
C[I think,that´s the end of the white group on the left.

EE: Well, end of white territory at least. The group shouldn't die.]

C[ I resign. Later I see the move on f12, but I think, the black territory is already bigger than the white one.


EE: Agree. After white's slow moves on the right, black was leading, but all
hope wasn't gone until black got his thick tortoise.])
(;W[mg];B[lg];W[mh];B[nf];W[og]C[EE: This should take care of the right side. There remains the points
g16 and j16 from which to reduce his upper moyo. Black still leads, but
the position is playable.]))
(;W[ph]C[EE: This is possible thanks to R8.];B[qh];W[qi];B[pi]
;W[qj]C[EE: Black is divided and will fight at a great disadvantage. I wouldn't
mind playing white here.]))
