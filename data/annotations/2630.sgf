at first i am no good in english
I ' m a beginner at all
my question is
 how to play good in middle game?
 how to know where are the safe area for jump

thank for review my game

** pwchu ** Hi Hicaru, by the way, this is my first time doing this review thing ^_^  Hope I can give you some comments on your game. Ok, let's see your game]
;B[pc]C[i think Q17 is look good and i fear to play at Q16
any suggestion?

** pwchu **  Q16 and Q17 are both ok.  Maybe it's a good idea to study a few joseki about Q16]
;W[pp];B[dc]C[**pwchu**  Both your stones are in a "low" position, which is not very good..... maybe D16 or C16 is better]
;W[cp];B[cn]TR[eq][ep][nq][qn][pn][np]C[**pwchu**  Usually will play on the marked point....]
;W[ep];B[qn];W[ql]LB[on:a][qq:b]C[i think he got me

** pwchu **  ^_^  You can play at a or b.  See var]
(;B[qj]C[then i play at R10
any suggestion?

** pwchu ** see the var];W[ol];B[om]TR[on]C[maybe P6 is better]
;W[pm];B[pn]C[now i think Q6 group in trouble

**pwchu** yes, seems to be];W[on];B[nm];W[oo];B[qm];W[pl];B[rl]
;W[rk];B[sl];W[sk];B[rm];W[qk];B[qp]C[now i think i survi

**pwchu** yes, but it's lucky, white could have killed it before...]
;W[qq];B[po];W[pq];B[ml]TR[rp]C[**pwchu** your lower right groups seems still have some problem, maybe it's good idea to play one more hand on S4 for safty ^_^]
;W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[qh];W[ni];B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[ng];B[of]
;W[mp];B[mn];W[de]C[ohh!!
how to defend that attack?

**pwchu** see the var]
(;B[cg]C[**pwchu** this is also ok];W[cc];B[ed]TR[cb]C[maybe c18 is better]
;W[dd];B[ec];W[bd];B[cb];W[bb]C[now i think he got corner];B[ca]
TR[ic][jc][id]C[this move is too small, should save it till later of the game... maybe try somewhere near the marked point]
;W[ba];B[eb];W[kc];B[mc];W[hc];B[cq]TR[dq]C[**pwchu** this move is too deep... and if you really want to move in this area, should consider D3 instead of C3 next time]
;W[dq];B[le];W[ke];B[lg];W[ld];B[me];W[kf];B[md];W[lf];B[mf]
;W[mg]C[he cut me T_T

** pwchu **  YES...];B[lh];W[mj];B[kj];W[lk];B[lj]C[**pwchu**  This make your stone too "heavy"...

(by the way, sorry for my poor english... i don't really know how to say this in english)]
;W[mk];B[jl];W[kk];B[jk];W[jj]C[cut again

**pwchu**  yes... when you play k8, you can expect white will cut you]
;B[mh]C[**pwchu**  this move doesn't do anything, except making your stones in a more danger position]
;W[nh];B[jh];W[ij];B[hl];W[oj]C[**pwchu**  ^_^  white must think you can kill him.... interesting]
;B[ii]C[**pwchu**  when you attack some group... you don't need to get too close... just walk along with it, and make sure it will have no eye or 1 eye is ok... usually getting too close is not a good idea]
;W[hj];B[gh];W[fj];B[gj]C[**pwchu** trying too hard usualy will not work]
;W[gk];B[gi];W[hk];B[ik];W[gl];B[kg];W[hm];B[il];W[gm];B[jn]
;W[jp];B[ho];W[in]C[i think i can make aroom at K12 group and L7 group

**pwchu**  I think it is very hard  to make room to live in this situtation]
;B[im];W[kl]C[ohhh];B[jm];W[jo];B[io];W[hn];B[hq];W[go];B[hp]
;W[jq];B[iq];W[gp];B[jr];W[kr];B[js];W[gq]C[**pwchu**  now you have 3 weak groups.... 1 or 2 must die]
;B[gr];W[fr];B[hs];W[ir]C[ohhh
he kill my group
how to keep my mt group alive];B[ks];W[lr];B[cr];W[bp];B[dr]
;W[er];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[bq];B[gs];W[br]C[again

**pwchu**  you can see the different is, white doesn't have any weak group.... (the one in the top is kind of weak), but black have many weak groups.  Always remember to secure yourself first before you try to attack]

Thank you for your kindness
thank for review my game

**pwchu**  Hicaru, i think you have to learn some basic tactics, maybe learn a few joseki, don't need too many, just a few simple one is ok..  It's nice for me to review your game, hope you can understand my poor english.  If you have any other question about the game, you can email me pw_chu@yahoo.com]
