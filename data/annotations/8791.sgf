C[Ben Hillier (Black) vs Pete (White)


Ben:
Thank you for reviewing the game. Any feedback is welcome, but I am particularly interested in two things:
1) An evaluation of my opening strategy.
2) What should I have done about the invasion that started at move 36? Should I have been able to stop it entirely.

Pete:
I would also thank you for reviewing the game.
Just like Ben, I would welcome Feedback on any move or my general strategy.

Hello both. I'm da9304 on KGS.  I won't be exhaustive, sorry. I'll just try to give you a few ways to improve your game. My words are just a 6k's words :)

Oh, and please excuse-me : I'm not a native english speaker.

NB : My review has been reviewed by a kgs dan player. Thanks to him !]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[cd];W[pq]
(;B[dn]LB[po:A][ep:B]C[D6 is too close from C4. Black should approach with an ogeima at D7 if he wants to approach this way.

But I think the right ways to approach the corner are A and B. A is most important, but B is better than D7 (either high approach or low approach because white cannot do the shimari)/]
;W[eq]C[I think D3 is too low, white should play tobi at E4. Black will suffer white power harder.]
;B[dj]C[Fine, but D6 is too close. So I think now the shape of  black's stones D10-D6 is too loose.]
(;W[qj]C[In my opinion, upper side is more important.];B[jd]
(;W[jp]SQ[fc][pf]C[Fine, but I think white should  invade around upper left corner.]
;B[qh]
(;W[pl];B[jj]C[Pete:
From this move on I realized that black would tried to create a large framework that he would consolidate if I would not invade early as long as his stones are loosely connected

Well, it's fine idea but it's a little too soon : black should play the shimari first, to make sure wiknesses are gone (I mean, "big hole").]
(;W[ni]TR[fc]C[In my opinion, it's too "shy".]
(;B[mg]C[This move is not really effective. 
Black would better tenuki, and do shimari E16 or invade white. But black is bigger, so black would better do shimari first.]
;W[og];B[pg]
(;W[of]C[Pete:
At this point I asked myself if  P12 is a weak point in that chain, but I thought a rather defensive move at this point would give black a possibility to further fortify his territory on the top

Because this move wasn't really good.];B[in]C[Black should cut now.]
(;W[kn]C[Or...]
(;B[lk]C[If I were white, I wouldn't answer this move, and invade.

Black should reduce.]
(;W[nl]
(;B[gg]C[Ben:
I was already claming more of the board than my opponent, and I was pretty happy with the progress at this point. I knew white would have to invade. This move was intended make that more difficult.

E16 is better.];W[nd];B[pf];W[ne]
(;B[ld]C[I would have do the shimari indeed of playing M16, which in my opinion, is too small.]
;W[lh]
(;B[kh]C[Ben:
White was clearly trying to reduce my boundaries. I was playing to keep him out.


Don't think where you have stones is your territory : it will make you play stupid moves to protect areas which are not yours yet. 

However, when you wan to protect "boundaries", play non contact moves.

Anyway, I do not think it's big move.];W[lg]C[It's painful for black.]
;B[kg]C[Now, white moves are sente because your are afraid of losing "territory".]
;W[mf];B[oc]C[Ben:
I let a black stone get surrounded. I really didn't care very much about it at that point.

I don't think this move is very important yet.];W[nc]C[White should not have answered, and take the sente to invade.]
;B[mc]C[Black should have tenuki. You want to defend both side, but you hurt them. You see it later in the game.]
(;W[fj]TR[fc]C[Ben:
And there it was! The anticipated invasion. My stategy at this point was simply prevent white from forming eyes over the next moves.

Pete:
In Hindsight I would rather have tried to invade at E17 as it would have been easier to make live on the sides

Yes, I think too. Doing territory in the center is harder than doing territory in a corner or in a side. So white should do something around upper left corner.]
(;B[fi]C[White took the risk of invading. Let him take all the risks : don't fight directly. Play non-contact moves and don't let him have the space to do eye-shape.]
;W[gi]
(;B[gh];W[hi]
(;B[hk];W[el];B[fm]C[Ben:
Still looking good. The white invasion was in a narrow line that claimed no territory at all.

Yep.];W[ei];B[ej]C[Ben:
I could have saved the stone, but that seemed like a very defensive move when I really should have been pressuring white. I decided to keep restricting the area. When/if white captured the stone at F11, it would leave a false eye that I could close down later.
Looking back at the game now, I wonder if it would have been better to stop the capture. I had to always pay attention to stop that false eye becoming a real one.

Pete:
Pete:
I was anticipating that black would save his stone, afterwards I would have connected at E10 and expanded upwards towards the corner or increased the pressure on the stone at D10, regarding on the answer of black]
;W[fh]C[It's too painful for black, he has weak stones now.]
;B[fg];W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[dg]
(;W[ef]C[Wrong direction];B[fe]
(;W[de]C[White should hit at cutting point.];B[dd];W[ck]C[Ben:
Now my problems started! I feared W D11, because that would split black in two. But I also had to stop white's invasion surround the stones at D6 and F7, and from connecting with white's stones in the bottom left. Too much to focus on!

Pete:
I actually saw this as a a chanche to connect with the stones below, I was sure that white would save his stones at D10 and E10 and that gave me the possibility to connect]
;B[cj];W[bn]C[Ben:
See what I mean! I had to try to stop this!

White : the action doesn't takes place here. You let black hurt you.]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bk];B[bl]C[Ben:
"Out of the cooking pan into the fire!". I had stopped the connection, but black stones were coming under pressure all over the place!]
;W[al];B[dk];W[dl]
(;B[em];W[cn];B[dm];W[fk]C[White : now D11 doesn't work anymore.]
;B[fl]C[You help white.];W[ek];B[gk];W[gj]
(;B[ji]SQ[dh][dj]C[Ben:
Back to my strategy of cutting of eye space. White's connection attempt looked to have succeeded, but the stones higher up were in trouble.

Yeah, you're in trouble there. That's why white should make the most of it.]
;W[ig]C[White should try to live. I think D11 can be a fine beginning.]
(;B[hh]C[Pete:
At this point I knew my group at F10 was in peril, so I tried to attack the black group at G13

Make it simple.]
(;W[ih];B[ii];W[ff];B[gf];W[ge]C[Ben:
Looked like I was the one about to be surrounded. The focus for the next few moves was saving the black stones.]
;B[hf];W[ie]C[Pete:
I probably should have played at F16 instead, as this would have  created an opening to the top for me. But I didn't see that move at that point]
;B[he]C[Ben:
That atari saved me!

Yes.];W[gd]
(;B[hd]C[Wrong area, I think that, now, white lives.]
(;W[id]C[wrong area.  See move 87.];B[hc];W[ic];B[gc];W[fd]
;B[fc]C[Ben:
Getting very scary around here. It looked like I would have a let a real eye form too!]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[ee]C[Pete:
Maybe it would have been better to leave the group behind and try to get some territory at the  upper right part of the board]
;B[ce];W[di]C[Ben:
Black stones were getting into trouble on all sides now.];B[ci]
;W[ch];B[cg]C[Ben:
Very fortunately for me, white missed C 14. The ensuing variation would have put the game complety beyond my reach.]
(;W[bh]C[Ben:
It looked like I had survived!

Pete:
I knew the bulk of my stones were dead, but I thought maybe I could at least connect the few stones. Black playing at B10 would quite possibly have killed them, though

About move 107, see :]
(;B[hj];W[bj];B[fi];W[bi];B[bg]C[Ben:
Much to my irritation, it looked like the large white group on the extreme left would reach safety. I spent some time looking for a way to stop it, but found none.

You should have thought about it sooner.

See move 102.];W[mb];B[lb];W[kc]
(;B[jc]TR[lc]C[Ben:
"Once more unto the breach". White was invading again.

Beware of cutting points !

I think black can, with M17.];W[kd];B[le]C[Ben:
I was still trying to capure all the invading stones.];W[je]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[ke];B[kf];W[lf]C[Ben:
I was still trying surround the white group. Perhaps I should have focused on the fate of my black group at M18 more :-(]
;B[if];W[lc]C[Ben:
White saw what I had missed. I realised I was going to lose more space.]
;B[hb];W[ob];B[pb];W[qb]C[Pete:
I wasn't sure about how to invade, I tried this stone without really knowing how the attack  would play out in the the end

There is a way to invade.];B[pa]
(;W[qa];B[qc];W[ri];B[rh];W[ho]LB[oq:A][qq:B]C[Ben:
White was one move ahead of me now. It was clear which territory still had to be fought for, but white got there first.

Ok now black has to invade and live. Black can get something with an attachment at R3 or P3.]
;B[fo];W[gq];B[lm];W[mo]C[Ben:
My focus switched to reduction now.];B[nm];W[mm]C[Pete:
Here I wasn't sure if N7 or N8 would be the better move. I tried N7  as I knew it would kill the black stone at O7]
;B[ml];W[mn];B[nk];W[ol];B[ok];W[pk];B[km];W[jn]C[Ben:
Not going the way I wanted. I had to claim more than this!]
;B[im];W[jm];B[jl];W[oj];B[nj];W[pi];B[gn];W[hn];B[hm];W[go]
C[Pete:
W E7 would have been better I guess];B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[hp]
;B[co];W[do];B[dp];W[bo];B[dq]C[Beware of cutting points.];W[dr]
;B[cq]C[Ben:
The spot at E4 was waiting to be filled obviously, but I thought white would try to stop my encroachment first ...]
;W[ep]C[Ben:
... so white got there first, and I realised that I just had three dead stones. I had been too greedy. White eventually wins the game by 2.5 points, so little things like this make a difference!]
;B[eo];W[co];B[am]C[Ben:
One final attempt to get those stones on the left. I thought I wouldn't succeed, but I was trailing, so I had to try.]
;W[ak];B[ah];W[bq]C[Ben:
Yep! White wasn't going to make this easy!];B[ai];W[an]C[Ben:
No way I could capture now. I could still reduce it a bit, but first of all I would have to play A13 and lose sente. I went on with other reductions first.]
;B[io];W[ip];B[jo];W[ko];B[ln];W[lo];B[li];W[mj];B[mk];W[kl]
;B[ll];W[mi];B[lj];W[qn]C[Ben:
I guess white was worried about invasions too. I didn't fancy my chances in that small space, but I had been thinking about it anyway, because I was losing. After this move from white, all hope of invading vanished.]
;B[jf];W[md];B[oa];W[nb];B[ag];W[na];B[pc];W[pe];B[qe];W[oe]
;B[aj];W[am];B[si]C[Ben:
I really would have played T10 here, considering how close the game was, but maybe he saw a threat I didn't.

Pete:
No, it really was careless play from me at that point]
(;W[rj];B[sj];W[sk];B[sh];W[rk];B[ph];W[oh];B[qi];W[pj]C[Pete:
Another example. I lost focus towards the end];B[ka];W[la];B[ja]
;W[mq]C[Ben:
White was really fearing that invasion. Maybe he had counted very accurately and realised he could do this, or maybe he thought the margin of victory was bigger than it really was!

Pete:
I didn't think it was that close, at that point I simply thought better be safe than sorry]

[kl][gm][en][fn]C[Well, let's sum up :

Black led the fuseki.
The issue for white has been to invade and live.
White waited too much to invade deeply. His invasion wasn't at the right spot.
The white's invasion was really hard to comment, because you both have helped your opponent, and deserve yourself. Black shouldn't have been in such a an uncomfortable position. White could have lived after black has put himself in trouble.


-You are not forced to answer your opponent's moves. If you consider that playing in an area is too small, take the sente and play big areas. 
-Take the time to wonder where big spots are.
-Let your opponent have territory. Accept to defend and give a little up.
-Losing a stone doesn't always matter.
-When you're in fight, take the time to see the whole groups in the area.
-Play at your opponent's cutting points, defend yours. 
-Take the time to read. You must take this habit, it will help you.

Anyway, it has been a pleasure. If you have any questions, ask me.
