C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

I think in this game, I am very weak in defencing from white's invasions. And having wrong moves during my invasions. Would you please help me in these two aspects, so that I can improve rapidly. Thanks you very much.]

[ng:C][nh:A][oh:B][ni:G][oi:H][nj:F]C[C: Actually, I don't know how to respond to this move, so I think a couple of time and did R14.

Q: Am I right? I just think this is not the best move, so what is the best? Can I give that white stone a strongest attack?

A. Firstly is an attack appropriate in this situation?


When you attack you will very rarely be able to actually kill the opponent's group so try and think of a move which achieves some other objective as well as attacking white.

If you do decide to attack there are lots of good options here - which you chose depends on personal preferences. I have marked some examples  A-E - note that all of these either expand black's area of influence or build new influence on the outside.

The problem with the move you played is that it allows white to escape to the centre and doesn't really secure the corner. White could still invade at R17 and get a ko. When you  attack you usually want to cut off the route to the centre before you try to take away eyespace on the edge. 

Maybe an all out attack is not the best move. Quieter moves like F-K still put some pressure on white and help to build black's position too (and I'll bet that in a 6-9 stone game you would have played K or F). 

You could also play L or M and let white worry about his weak stone. Remember when you attack a stone you usually force you opponent to make it stronger - sometimes leaving it weak works better! White's stone is quite light as it is - and not particularly weak so maybe it would be better not to attack  yet.

If you REALLY want the corner then play N which still makes life tougher for white's stone.]
;W[qg]LB[rf:A][qj:B][rj:C]C[C: Now, I am considering whether I play S13 to protect the territory or K17 to capture the great place. But, at last, I decided to protect my territory. However, after I reviewed this game, I think I should better go K17.

Q: Is that right?

A.The move you played (A) has the merit of consistency with your previous move - if you were going to play around k16 or k17 you would have been better doing it before playing R14.

Another option that is consistent with the way you are playig here is to play B or C so that white has no life-making options on the edge]
;B[rf];W[rg]LB[ng:A]C[A poor, heavy move by white - much better to jump out with A]
;B[jc]LB[ng:A][ri:C][rj:B]C[White has made a heavy group - why not make life difficult by capping at A or resticting his access to the edge with B or C. 

It seems odd to me that you were keen to attack white when he had just one (light ) stone - now he has made himself heavy you leave him alone!

You can make the extension later when you have built up some influence in sente by attacking white]
;W[nc]LB[nd:C][ne:A][oe:B]C[Q: Is K17 too far? how can I respond to this?

A In this situation the key thing is to keep white's two groups separated so a move like A,B or C is called for]

;W[me];B[mc];W[nd]C[Why are you fiddling around with these endgame points at this stage?

C[fine - sensible move];W[co];B[dn]C[What bad sequence? This is joseki and black's 3 space extension is an ideal formation.]
;W[fq];B[fo]LB[go:B][io:A][hq:C]TR[cn][dn]SQ[co][dp][fq]C[Q: Should I take B11 first?

I can't see why you want to take either point. my move here would be A  (or maybe B) - building blacks centre moyo and threatening to invade at C. The move you played is too close to your stones marked  with a triangle and his marked with a square. You aren't supposed to play close to strong stones.]
;W[bi];B[ch]C[C: I did this because I want to see how white moves, so that I might have a chance to take care of other weak point.

White's move is an endgame point you should ignore it];W[bh]
;B[bk];W[dh]LB[eh:C][ci:B][di:A]TR[gg][fh][ei]C[Why is this stone important to you its only  a couple of points.  Better to hem white in with A (white B black C etc)  Cutting doen't give white a good position IMO - see variation. The big prize here is to seal white in roughly along the line of triangles and build a big central moyo.]

(;B[ci];W[dg]
(;B[hq]LB[io:B][jo:A][lq:C]C[C: Originally, I just want to attack (W)6, but may be due to the wrong sequence so that I cannot achive the task.

Q: Am I too aggressive on that?
What is the best sequence?

It's not too aggressive - but it is pointlessly aggressive. it doesn't achieve any other purpose.Attacking moves should usually be dual purpose  except when you can read out a killing sequence.

Better to threaten this invasion with a move above like A or B which build your centre moyo. If you want this attack to be severe you also need a stone at C - otherwise white's extension to N3 (made a few moves later ) is too easy.

At this point the cgoban score estimator gives black +48.5 mainly based on the central influence you have at this stage - for some reason you squandered it because you never seem to try to use it or extend it.]
;W[gp]C[You should have been expecting this move. Were you?]

(;B[ip]C[Q: Is this move OK? Or have to play M3?

If you play M3 white can capture your stone at H3 (see variation) . In the circumatances this is not a bad move however h4 is probably better. If you wanted to play M3 you should have played it insted of H3 see variaiton earlier]
;W[mq];B[no];W[nq];B[op];W[jp];B[lp]LB[io:A]C[what is this all about ?

It doesn't threaten to split white and it doesn't block his way to the centre - it is a pointless move.

You must extend up at  A to pull out your invading stones.]
;W[lq];B[ri]TR[kg][gh][li][fj][mk][gm][jn][ip][hq]C[OK its a big endgame reverse sente point - but we aren't in the endgame yet. The fates of the triangled area and stoens are undecided so why play this now?]

TR[no]SQ[mn][nn][jo][ko][mo][ip][jp][lp][mp][np][hq][jq][lq]
[mq][nq]C[C: I think this move I should have played D11 directly.

Q: Am I right?

No - D11 is horrible shape and serves no purpose.

F11 is one of your better moves - although in this position the centre is open from too many directions for a gote move like F11 to be fully effective.

Why are you ignoring the triangled stone? (and why didn't white take it on the next move?) Capturing this stone has a huge effect on the stones marked  with a square and on the lower right centre. Ive put in a variation a few moves later which shows what could happen.]
;W[di];B[cj];W[kg]TR[no]C[C: Now, white begins to reduce my territory by invasion.

Q: How can I respond to this?

Firstly this isn't your territory - it is a sphere of influence (a rather weak one actually) and white isn't invading it - rather he is reducing it and expanding his own area at the same time - an invasion usually means going into the middle of an opposing area - and trying to live. This stone is connected to its neighbours.

The only response is to defend with (say) k13

Why are you both continuing to ignore the triangled stone?]

[om]CR[jh][kh][ji][ki][jj][kj][jk][kk]C[Q: Is this right? Or M13 is better, If so, what is the best sequence?

This is a relatively small area. Your choice of move needs to be based on a whole board assessment. 

I have marked out the secure territories with triangles for you. You can see that the top left and bottom right cancel each other - otherwise white has47+6.5 komi black has 35 so white is ahead by just under 20 pts on territory at present - however black has potential for  more territory in the centre. This type of calculation should guide your thoughts - you only need to try aggressive things like M13 if you can't win more peacefully. 



The point about white's stone on l13 is that it shifts the boundary one space to the left so now if  both sides build wall white gets more at first - however the squared stones undermine white's moyo lower down so the exchange  favours black who builds about 15 pts extra. Having said that the stone on O5 is still more important.]

(;W[kh];B[jh];W[jm]C[C: I begin to realise that I have to save those stones.

Q: How can I achive this?

Ahh too late you should have played p5  or k7 earlier ( and so should white...)]

(;B[ki]C[C: I think this is a bad move. Because I have lost my initiative hands.

Q: How can I ensure the territory and saving those weak stones at the bottom?

The important point remains P5 but it doesn't work for you now so you have to play L7 to let the stones escape and let white capture on P5 so his link up also]
;W[li];B[km]C[OK  - the right move];W[jl]
(;B[jk]C[No No - now you can play P5 and catch the 3 white stones - if you do this than the cutting point is not relevant in variations and black seems to get either the n6 stones or the n3 stones in most variants]
;W[kl];B[lm];W[ll]C[Q: Should I block at N8?

You can - white can't cut because of too few liberties. However it should have worked out OK with n7]

I don't see how g23 is better - your territory has already shunk so far that you are 25pts behind the only option now for black is the c17 invasion - it doesn't work - but you might get lucky - otherwise may as well resign.]
;W[gk];B[eo]C[C: I think I was too early to play this, and I should simply do F9 instead, and play this later so that I can connect them to my stones.

Thank you very much.

Three points spring to mind.

1 Have a plan about what you want to do (eg build a moyo by attacking white or let white have the outer influence while you build territory - then take away his central moyo by invading). It doesn't really matter if it is the right plan (there may not be a right plan) - at least your moves will be consistent. In this game both players seemed to keep changing their minds about what they wanted to do.

2. Estimate the score regularly from about move 30 on. Do this by counting the secure territories first. Then estimate what is likely to happen to the remaining areas. Of course there may be different possibilities here so you may need to make more than one estimate. The difference between different estiates will help you choose which way to play.  If you are ahead then play less aggressively and solidify your position. If you are behind then you may need to take risks - but don't take bigger risks than are needed to give yourself a chance of winning.

3 Tactically, concentrate on connecting your stones together ( and disconnecing your opponent's.) I am still amazed that that atari at O5 sat on the board for so long with both players ignoring it. I would have captured/connected there at the first opportunity (about move 77/8)]
