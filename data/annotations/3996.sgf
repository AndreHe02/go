C[Hello, I'm white in this game.  I know we're not supposed to submit games that we won by a large margin, but this game was anything but a easy win.  The score doesn't really reflect the game.  This was a strange game for me.  Each side lost a huge cluster of stones, and I won because the cluster I got was larger.

Thanks for reviewing!

-- Hi, I'm Zoran, a student from Belgrade, Serbia. I've tried to make this review clear and easy to follow, but I didn't avoid going into details or making some points that require additional thinking on your part in order to be understood :)  Plese do send me any critique or requests for further explanations!  My e-mail is bruce@tesla.rcub.bg.ac.yu.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[qd]C[shmolex [18k\]: hi];W[dq];B[oc]
(;W[de]LB[jd:A]C[-- in my opinion, this is not bad, but it does leave a big point unattended where it could in fact have been utilized by White early on.  See, Black has an enclosure at the top and White is just making one; so this means that whoever takes the spot rightr in the middle will have a huge advantage in the fight over the top.  Sure, it's all but good manners to criticize someone's third move in the game of Go :), but I'll dare note that K16 is now a veru huge point.  In fact, had I been White, I would have played it right away - see variation.]
;B[do];W[cp]LB[co:A][eo:B][fp:C][gq:D]C[-- is this a joseki?  I think standard moves are A, B, C and D.  It might be; my joseki knowledge is very thin. :)]
;B[eq]
(;W[ep]TR[do]C[-- It seems a bit counterintuitive to play E4.  This way D5 gains a cutting function it had lacked before.  Maybe go for E2, see variation for an uneducated guess.]
;B[dp];W[fq]C[-- Black should simply extend.  When both players have cut one another into a myriad tiny groups, one who starts gaining liberties faster than the other is sure to make at least some profit.]

(;B[cq];W[er]C[-- great, a ponnuki near the corner, that's gotta make some points later on.]
;B[co];W[bp];B[bq];W[cr];B[bo];W[br];B[ap]C[I think I came out ahead after this exchange, although my next move should definetly have been an extension around J3 or k3 maybe?]
;W[nq]C[-- J3 and K3 would be too conservative!  You're right to have played an approach move.  The lower White group is looking good and, in fact, you actually *want* to provoke Black to play a pincer here.  If he does, you simply slide O3 into the corner and make a quick life, then attack the pincer stone from both sides.]
;B[kp]C[-- hmmm, an interesting pincer by Black, but not a good one I'm afraid.]

(;W[qq]C[-- here you made a strategic mistake.  You're strong on the left, so why not split those Black stones?  See variation.]
;B[qp]C[I was surpised he didn't try cutting off the stones.

-- actually a cut would cause him much more trouble than he wants here.  This way he gets a strong wall facing his top enclosure.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[np];B[no]LB[oq:A]C[-- Black can go P3 here in the standard fashion (weakens White)]

(;W[mp]TR[np][nq]C[-- this is the so-called 'empty triagle', a shape which is said to be slow and inefficient.  Although there are indeed times when empty triangle is the only move that works, in most cases you should not even think about it.  A hane would quite suffice here; see variation.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[rq]C[-- actually you could hane there; see variation.]

(;W[qr]C[-- but if you want to do this...];B[rr]LB[ps:A][qs:B]
C[-- ...then you really need to do A.  You can also play B but that wil give Black one extra forcing move.]

(;W[mo];B[qs]C[Me not playing where he just did cost me all those stones.

-- actually you had some opportunities to save them later on, but unfortunately you missed them.]
;W[pr];B[ps];W[os];B[rs];W[mr];B[nn];W[mn]LB[lq:A]C[-- For quick and easy life, play A.  
It's difficult to see all those spots in the real game, sometimes you see them but miss :) , other times you just don't see them but your opponent does.  A rule of thumb says to try and make a quick life ASAP when you're in trouble, since running away usually makes your opponent stronger.  Black is building some serious territory here along the right side.]
;B[kn];W[qj]C[-- this is the right place, but not the right time :)  You really must take care of your big group under attack.]
;B[ql]C[-- bad.  Black should extend from the shimari.  He's strong enough in the lower right corner.]
;W[qg];B[ok];W[oi];B[pj];W[pi];B[qk];W[rj];B[rf];W[rg];B[gp]
;W[re];B[qe];W[qf];B[rd];W[sf];B[lq]C[-- whoops, now you're in trouble :)]
;W[mq];B[gq]C[and the possibility of me getting territory at the bottom was looking so promising at the beginning....

-- yes, doesn't look good for White at all.  A very rough estimate says Black is ahead some 60-70 points.  I'm really curious how you managed to win here! :)]
;W[kr];B[eo];W[gr];B[fp];W[eq];B[hr];W[ir]C[-- really F1 is the only important point, otherwise Black gets your group]
;B[gs];W[fr];B[iq];W[is];B[hs];W[fs];B[hq];W[ds]C[-- geez, what a tricky combo to live, I surely would never see it :)]
;B[jr];W[ks];B[js];W[cj]C[I got greedy and hoped that he would just defend.  Best move is probably the keima at c13?  That or probably secure the lower right stones.

-- lower right stones are HUGE!  Then comes C10 (your move) and the previosly mentioned K16, over which I'd have a hard time deciding which one is bigger.  But the N2 group is by far the biggest thing on the table.  Keima should be disregarded here on account that it is too slow: you should extend across the no man's land as far as you can, plus being behind in score will push your stones a line or two further into the fire, so to speak :)]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[ch];B[ce];W[bg];B[cc];W[cb]
;B[bb]
(;W[bc]LB[cd:A]C[-- ooh, too bad you missed the right spot by a hair's breadth.  Should have cut at A, to split Black into two harmless piles of stones.]
;B[cd];W[ab];B[dd];W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[ee];W[df];B[cl]
(;W[ff]LB[hd:A]C[-- hmm, maybe go a bit wider, see variation]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd];W[gf];B[fd];W[gc];B[hd];W[hc]
;B[id]C[I think this is a win win situation for me.  If I dont capture this group, I secure the top territory and create a lot of influence towards the center. And if I capture the group, that's even better.

-- this group will be very hard to capture, but the thinking is correct.  Now only if you could save those lower right stones...]
;W[sm]C[did I use the monkey jump too early?  It ended in sente so I didn't really lose anything.

-- then it's alright :)  Monkeys often end up finishing in sente for the attacker, how and why I really have no idea, so it's not uncommon to see one performing it in the middle of the game.  Must be something to do with life and death. O:-)

Actually Black has a few things to worry about concerning his capture, the big White group at the bottom, so he'd better answer and not think about sente or gote]
;B[sl]C[-- but he didn't chose the exactly ideal move either]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[sk];B[rk];W[sl];B[sn];W[sj];B[qn];W[ek]C[-- this is big, maybe not the biggest on the board but still worth noting.  Noce moyo move :)]
;B[dk];W[dj];B[el];W[ck];B[dl];W[fk];B[gl];W[fl];B[fm]C[tingting11 [10k\]: N2 group need help

-- see, someone agrees with me B)];W[gk];B[hl];W[hk]C[I held off on securing the bottom left because I thought that if he tried blocking me from the center, I would go m2 and then n1 and O1 would be miai to live.  And if he tried m2, I would just escape to the middle.  Boy was I wrong.

-- P1 has only two liberties, I know it and kibitzers know it, but you've missed it in the heat of the battle and your readahead is doomed :)]

;B[nl]C[I've pretty much given up on the lower left now.  I thought that I would use up it's usefulness as a ko threat and then reduce black's corner by a bit.

-- good thinking.  Don't forget you have a two-step ko at P5 to save the group.]
;W[ls];B[ns];W[nm];B[on]C[jackgil [17k\]: r11?];W[qm];B[rn]
;W[pl];B[nl];W[nj];B[ll]C[At least I salvaged something.   But I'm behind by a good 40-50 points.  I thought about resigning, but I thought I'd give one last try at killing the top right cluster

-- you've both played a very poor ko fight here, but at least you've gotten back some good 20 points.  I have a feeling this is going to be interesting :)]
;W[kd]C[-- good move!];B[je];W[lf];B[ke];W[le];B[ld];W[kc];B[lc]

;B[ih]C[tingting11 [10k\]: h10];W[hj]C[was this move necessary?  I was running low on time and couldn't take the chance.

-- well I don't think so, but when you've got such a big group captured, it doesn't really matter. :)]

;B[ci];W[di];B[eh];W[dh]C[His time ran out here.  I only had 18 seconds left.  I was pretty dissapointed for misreading the bottom right, but I think I handled the top left pretty well besides the mistake at j17.

Thanks again!

-- well it was a fun game to watch and comment!  All in all, as a player you seem to be of a more intuitive and emotinal kind, which most of us players rooted in logic dread and despise :)  You're solid and stable, using what you know to fight while it makes sense.  What you need working on is life and death, and maybe some middlegame practice (it's traditionally hard for everyone except for proffesionals).  Also grab some professional games, doesn't matter if they're not commented, and review just the opening sequences.  I think you shouldn't take long to start getting the feeling for early direction of play, influence, moyo buildup, territory stability, sente, gote, tenuki etc.


Like I said in the beginning, feel free to e-mail me with anything about this review, I'd be glad to clarify.

Happy playing! :)

Best,
Zoran])
