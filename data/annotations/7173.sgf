C[Comments for black by Az];B[pc];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[nq];W[qn]
;B[jp]TR[iq]C[Az: The min-chinese is a more common extension since it doubles as a pincer when white approaches the LL corner. I can't say that this is bad for sure, but it feels odd.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pf];B[nc];W[pj]C[Az: W is too flat on the RHS, this is a good result for black.]
;B[cf];W[gc];B[dj];W[ep]
(;B[eo]C[Az: This doesn't put much pressure on white, the more conventional move at D6 would be more severe.]
;W[fo];B[en];W[dp];B[co];W[gp]TR[cq]C[Az: A big mistake by w, he should hane first, now black gets the vital point.]
;B[cq];W[lq];B[qq]TR[dp][ep][fo][gp]LB[lp:A]C[Az: First big mistake. B should try to link up his stones with 'a'. This would keep some pressure on the W group and keep the moyo in check. Taking the corner is greedy and suddenly this whole part of the board becomes W's moyo. It's also a bit submissive since your 2 stones aren't so weak that you should have to abandon them.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[ro];W[rn];B[qo];W[po];B[qp]
;W[np]C[Az: Suddenly the game got a lot more promising for white.]

(;B[io]C[Az: Heavy! If black wanted to save this stone and attack white, he shouldn't have gone into the corner. At very least, B should play lighter moves since he's in W's area now]
;W[gm];B[jm]LB[im:A]C[Az: The wrong shape. 'a' is better];W[ch]

(;B[dh]C[Az: Black stands to loose a lot of terroritory if he plays this way, and white has to respect the fact that he has a weak group nearby. I would prefere to start a splitting attack, though this depends on your stomache for complicated fighting.]
;W[di];B[ci];W[ei];B[bh];W[cj];B[bi];W[dk];B[fl];W[ej];B[gl]
;W[fm];B[em];W[hm];B[jk]C[Az: The result isn't very good for B, too many cutting points.]
;W[hl];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc]LB[gj:A]C[Az: Keeping the white groups apart is more important the a move in the corner. Black has fairly strong shape and doesn't have time be taking gote now.]
;B[be];W[hj]LB[lp:A]C[Az: Start with the attachment at 'a' since its forcing]
;B[ml];W[mj];B[ol];W[kl];B[jl];W[kn];B[km];W[jn]
(;B[lp]C[Az: The order here is odd, this is a move B should have made earlier]
;W[in];B[mp];W[kp];B[mq];W[kq];B[ln];W[pm];B[on];W[pn];B[oj]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[lc];B[jc]LB[kd:A]C[Az: This looks risky white has a lot more thickness in this area than black. Black is leading on terroritory, the reducing move at 'a' ought to be enough. In game black got the upper hand in the subsequent fighting, but it was actually rather dangerous for him.]

thanks for the comment...];B[nh];W[jj];B[nf]C[Az: This is pretty much game over, end of comments.]
