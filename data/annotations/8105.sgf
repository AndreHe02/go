C[Hi, thank you for taking the time to review my game against the trial version of MFoG. =) Since this is a computer, I wanted to try a different opening. Edited in CGoban 3.

My goal here is to take the center point, big points, then make lots of reductions, running to the center point for help.


Hello, my name is Justin.  I'll preface my comments with  "J:  ".  I haven't done a lot of studying, and so can't back up what I say with evidence, just experience.  The variations I've made are the first things that come to mind.

I like the creativity behind your opening strategy.  Playing in unexpected ways can yield good results and it's good to try new things.  But my initial reaction to this description is that it might spread you a little thin.  The center of the board typically is the hardest to defend and to make territory with.]
;B[jj];W[qp];B[jp];W[pe]C[I saw a 21k play this move on KGS, it didn't turn out well for him. Is this an okay move?

J:  Honestly, I haven't seen this played much, haven't played it myself and I haven't done a lot of studying.  But a quick glance at the KOGO Joseki Dictionary has this to say: "There are several 5-4 trick plays, often involving unfathomable reading, with pitfalls at any point."  The perfect move for a computer.]
;B[jd];W[oq]C[Maybe white should've kept going for corners?

J:  Maybe.  Almost philosophical at this point to say yes or no.  The corner enclosure is plenty strong, though.  I play this move a lot myself.  Maybe B should've gone for corners  ; )]
;B[dd];W[fc];B[df]C[Decided on a standard reply.];W[hc];B[jb]
C[Trying to separate Q15 and H17 in the future.

J:  This is not in the future.  This is now.  K18 effectively cuts W's 2 stones and forces W to respond locally.  Might be better to save this move for later and start closing in around F15 or H15.  Either of these moves would work better with a center-oriented strategy.  You might have to let W live small on the north edge, but you would control the center.]
;W[fe]
(;B[ff]C[J:  Too direct.  You can't hope to kill this way.  There's a saying:  "Don't touch the stones you're attacking".  This move invites W to counterattack.]
;W[ee]C[J:  I hate being in this position.  There's not much you can do to defend a double-peep.  Locally, W is ahead.]
(;B[de];W[ef];B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B[gf];W[ge]
(;B[if]C[Something feels wrong to me regarding this exchange. Am I crazy?

J:  Not at all. Because of the double-peep, you had to give a little in one direction or the other.  It's hard to say which direction is better, but blocking at E14 instead of D15 might have worked better with your center-stone strategy. This move helps your two stones, but still leaves W with some forcing moves.]
(;W[lc];B[jc];W[le];B[pj]C[Wanted a big point and do the same thing as the top.

J:  Common wisdom says the last corner should be taken.  If you could build a wall facing E12, you might make a lot of territory and keep W confined to the south edge.  THEN play this move.

And regardless, what this move does is different than your K17 group.  K17 cuts a weak group off from a strong one.  Q10 seperates two strong groups (not as useful).]
;W[qh]
(;B[nj]C[I feel like I got too scared here for no reason. Maybe Q8 would've given me more territory and the win.

J:  I'd say you're right that you got scared for no reason.  You still have time to dive deeper, rob W of some side territory, then jump out to center.  This move gives W the initiative.]
;W[gg];B[hf];W[pl]
(;B[nl]C[J:  Careful playing a move like this.  With Q8 in place, you're inviting the double-peep again.  I feel like this right angle shape is almost as bad as the empty triangle.

If you wanted to build a wall facing your center stone, I would suggest N8 or maybe P9.  If you wanted to reinforce O10 and Q10, you could play P12.]
;W[nd]C[J:  Solid move for W, but there's still a chance to invade the corner and either live or connect to K17.]
;B[ih];W[gi]C[J:  This is an important moment for your strategy.  Instead of building off your center stone, you made a long wall and a lot of territory.  Not a bad idea at all, but if you wanted to use a center strategy, maybe leaning on G11 with a shoulder hit at H10.  You might push W's encroaching dragon to the west edge and take half the southwest and northwest quadrants as territory.  Almost philosophical to say which is better.]
;B[ej];W[gk];B[el];W[gm];B[en];W[go];B[ep];W[gq]
(;B[eq]C[I felt like E2 was a wasteful move, so decided on E3 instead.

J:  Either one feels like end game, feels too small.  I would suggest taking this opprotunity to play elsewhere instead.]
;W[lp]
(;B[mn]C[Maybe K6 here?

J:  I think so.  At this point you have a large, weak dragon in the center of the board with no base on any edge and it's cut off from any of your solid territory.  You'll have to make life in the center (which is inefficient) and so can't hope to make many points there, regardless.  But yes, I think K6 is a better direction for B than N6.]
;W[in];B[jn];W[jm];B[kn]C[The initial goal was for me to connect to the stones near tengen, but it didn't pan out so well...]
;W[km];B[lm];W[ll];B[ml];W[kl]
(;B[mp]C[Abandoned my original plan.

J:  This attack feels premature.  It invites W to try to cut.  If you make an eye first, that gives you some room to breath and ensures you connect out to O10.  Then you have a bit more stability with which to attack.  Either way, it's still a hard fight for B to live.]
;W[lo]
(;B[mo];W[ln];B[mm];W[jo];B[mk]C[Could I have saved those three stones in the last few moves? I had decided to sacrifice them and try to protect my center space, but now I wonder if I could've lived..

J:  Not sure if the sacrifice is necessary or not.  The fighting is complicated.]
;W[ip];B[kf];W[lf];B[lg];W[ng];B[mh];W[nh];B[mi]C[Turned out the way I'd planned, but I think it might not have been the best plan to begin with.]
;W[kg];B[jg];W[kh]
(;B[lh]C[J:  It is unnecessary to defend here.  The diagonal is a solid connection.]
;W[ki];B[kk];W[lk];B[lj];W[kj];B[jk];W[ke];B[jf];W[je]C[J:  This is a pretty huge move for W.  It doesn't just cut off 3 stones, but makes territory all around them as well.]
;B[ii];W[ie];B[on]C[Trying to eek out a little territory. After playing this, I realized it was a stupidly small move.]
;W[he]
(;B[li]C[I was afraid he might figure something out to kill one of my groups. Perhaps I had a sequence played out during the game that resulted in some death. Then again, probably not. =)

J:  You've got an eye space of at least 4 in a row (W's group at L12) and you're ahead on liberties everywhere.  I think you're safe.  There are some big moves you could play instead.]

J:  Too late for that.  Now that this area is settled, the end game begins.]
;B[qo];W[ro];B[hk];W[rp];B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[fb]C[I thought this exchange was something I should've played long ago (and MFoG too, for that matter). It seems like a pretty big play to me, but I missed it until now.]
;B[ed];W[fd];B[oi];W[oh];B[qi];W[ph];B[lb]C[For the next exchange, it seems white plays his defense of my trying to live really badly?

J:  Yes, it seems W could have played stronger.];W[mc];B[mb]
;W[nb];B[kb];W[fh]C[J:  I don't understand this move.  It invites you to gain life on the north edge.  W shouldn't worry about the cut at G12 because there are probably at least 2 eyes around J5 and K6.  A W move around H18 or J18 would seem to kill B.]

J:  Even though you lost, I'd say this was a good experiment.  You kept it close even though it was an uphill battle.  I would suggest watching for moves you can ignore so you can play bigger moves elsewhere, being very aware of the direction of play and maybe studying life/death problems to boost your confidence for playing elsewhere.  Also, don't attack too soon or too close.  A lot of times, it's not about killing stones as much as gaining strength through pushing and keeping sente.]
