C[Hi, the point that I was stuck on without good idea was invasion at lower side (after #37). I've made some of the stones live after, but it was not the way it should be made.
Thx for any comment, including endgame, in wich I've lost lot of point I feel.
Marcin

JFR:  Hi, I'm John [5k\] and I'll be reviewing your game.  The main points I have are in the opening (you lost a lot of points there).  At move 30 you are very behind in points and have two weak groups that white can push on to make great walls and massive influence.  The fact that you only lost by about 10 points shows some misplaced moves for white and some skill on your part in the middle game to make points and exploit White's mistakes.  I also made some endgame notes (you did play some moves out of order) but the endgame is not where you lost the game (or by any means "a lot of points").  

Remember: I am 5k, do not follow my moves blindly (there are surely some that are wrong).  But rather think about the "go theory" behind what I am suggesting and how you can incorporate it into your games.  It is better to understand "go theory" and the "fundamentals" then to memorize long sequences.  

Also, study basic life and death problems (~move 135 your upper left was in trouble).

Suggestions:

Read: Opening Theory Made Easy, by Otake Hideo (Kiseido K36)

Replay the first 50 moves of pro games (don't try to understand too much at once, and don't try to "copy" pro moves but rather appreciate the flow of their games)  Look for games that do not fight immediately (often these are games that were played to the end with a point margin less than 3) as you need to practice the opening, and many games with immediate fighting jump right past the opening into the middle game.


Happy Playing!];B[qd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp]
(;B[qn]
(;W[np]LB[lq:B][nq:A]C[JFR:  White should play at A.  It is good to alternate your 3rd and 4th line plays.  With this move, white is going to need another stone on the 3rd line (perhaps at B) to define the base.]
(;B[qk]LB[pj:A]TR[qd][qn]C[JFR:  Again, alternate 3rd and 4th line plays.  Black could play at A for better connection on the right]
;W[jq]CR[cj][dj][ck]C[JFR: black can take the lead with this move.  A stone at C10, D10, or C9 would ensure a safe lead with solid play.

White gave you a free move (and a much bigger point) after playing in the bottom (white is over-concentrated)]
;B[oe]LB[nc:C][oc:A][od:B]C[I was happy with the move and other moves up to #17 , was I right?

JFR:  A - C are the standard shimari.  I beleive your move is too high (5th line) and leaves open an invasion on the top (thus needing an extra move to form a base)]
;W[ce]LB[ed:E][fd:F][ch:A][dh:B][ci:D][di:C]C[JFR:  in response to this white approach stone, black has squeeze plays A-D which may be good because of the solo white stone in the bottom left
E-F are also ideas to build territory at the top];B[ee]C[JFR: Another jump out to the 5th line without a base.  This move doesn't work, it's not getting territory and it's not a pincer.  It's gently letting white get territory on the left while keeping the top open.  Someone stronger than me could better give analysis on all the reasons this is not joseki.  From my reading level it is bad shape.

Try some of the moves I suggested for black (A-F in the last move)]
;W[dg];B[kc]LB[oc:B][od:A]TR[oe]C[JFR: This move may be the right idea, but seems strangely placed.  If P15 were placed differently (perhaps A-B), as mentioned before, this move would be better shape.

In some respect this move may be considered soft. A pincer at D11 would take control of the game and put it on Black's terms.]
;W[jj]SQ[ce][dg]C[JFR:  White should be building a base on the left.]
(;B[ck]C[JFR:  Looks at some of the vars for this move.  This move gives white lots of options and does not put pressure on white. Because this stone is not approaching a corner, white gets to push it around (the struggles for life) and white gets lots of influence around it]
;W[ci];B[cn];W[co]
(;B[dm]C[JFR:  This of Karate.  You Need to put your defenses up solid.  This is a loose noodle move.]
;W[bo];B[bn]C[JFR:  I think black will have trouble invading the bottom left now.  Also 21 does not create a base for black.  If white had wished he could have attacked the group as so-]
(;W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[bl];W[id];B[ke]C[JFR:  while good shape for the upper right, upper left looks in trouble now]
;W[fc]C[JFR: now the 5th line play shows one of it's weaknesses]
;B[cc]C[JFR:  black needs to live, yes, but this looks to be a small corner.]
;W[ge];B[nj]C[JFR: black should defend the upper left and not let white connect and/or cut]
(;W[on]
(;B[pl]C[JFR: what is the purpose of this move?  This about it.  There are big and important moves on the board: find them.

The right side is fine, look elsewhere for where this stone could be used for efficiently.]
;W[fp]C[JFR: this move is big.  proverb: "Your opponent's move best move is often your best move"  Think if you had played here.  Now it is hard to play there.]
;B[hq];W[hp]C[What should be proper continuation for black?

JFR: at this point I can not see any.  White gains mighty influence and black stone is very weak.  I don't think H3 was the proper move.  I would try for extensions off of your weak groups.]

JFR: This is gote (as you mentioned) and there are many sente moves left worth more points

Worth noting : Try to not play "hope go" and instead be confident about the points you can make in the endgame by looking for sente moves that are worth more points.  I would start with your "ultimate sente" moves (a->b, c->d)

I don't have many endgame comments, it seems rather natural.  I would recommend concentrating on the opening and life and death problems.

This is the last comment.  Let me know if you have any questions
