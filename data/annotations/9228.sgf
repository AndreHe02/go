You're right, but as long as B has moves like 1, 2 and 3, he's fine. If you're really worried about W making too many points in the center, play one of these points straight away, ignoring R9!]

Also, once you're done chasing this group, you'll build significant strength on top. Attacking F17-F15-F13 will be natural and easy. Game over.]
