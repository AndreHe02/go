C[Hi, I am dancor 5k on KGS.  I will prefix my comments with "dc:".  I have also included some variations.
In general, I think you would benefit most from:
- studying a little of the two josekis that I point out
- counting more and envisioning strategies that are aligned with your current estimate of the score
(be aggressive when behind, in ways that aim to make up specific amounts of points)
- playing for "mutual damage" in the endgame instead of responding passively in gote]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[cj];W[fc];B[de];W[ic];B[qf]C[Is this a sensible point to attack?

dc: I recommend treating the lower right corner first since the lone 3-4 stone at wQ3 is less resolved than the lone 4-4 stone at wQ16.  However, I think bR14 is ok too, so far.  Black should also be thinking about getting bK4 which works well with the left side.]
;W[qe]
(;B[qi]C[dc: This is unusual; the normal move is bQ14, which I recommend here.  The second most common move is bP14 but that is not recommended here; bP14 is for when you need to play looser and lighter because you are already under greater attack or behind.  This is the first joseki I think you would benefit from studying.]
;W[pf]C[dc: This is painful.];B[rf];W[qn];B[ql];W[re];B[pg]
C[Is this outcome ok for black? Or did white gain too much on top and below?

dc: Black is a little small and low and white has big stable corners.  It is still ok since black has a nice left side.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[fo]
(;B[cn]C[dc: bD6 seems more cohesive and flexible.  bC6 feels too low and passive given the environment of this strong high side.  White has all the flexibility: pushing down around wE7, or pushing in around wC8 is still possible later.  I think this is the second joseki you would benefit from studying.]
;W[ip]C[This white move surprised me. What would be an appropriate answer to this?

dc: wJ4 is actually an extremely common play for the move after wF5.  Common joseki continuations now are bH4, bK3, and bE3.  All three are common if bC6 had been played at bD6.  With bC6, the most common is bE3.  This is probably because the pattern of the three stones bC6, bD4, bE3 do tend to hold the entire corner. (It's basically the largest three stone pattern that encloses the corner without invasion being directly possible.)]

(;B[fr]C[Is this a good attack? I was not too happy white got the cornet, but it seemed ok. 

dc: This move is small right now.  This would be fine to eventually play, but there are not a large amount of points to be had, and the wF3 stone isn't performing any tactical function (it's a "throw-away stone").  It is better to develop other areas or put pressure on the wH5 stones.]
;W[dr];B[kq];W[lo];B[of];W[pe];B[nf];W[md]C[I suspect this was stupid by black, giving white such a big corner. But how to prevent it?

dc: I think the important question around this point of the game is if the white stones around wH5 will become a lliability for white by being attacked, or if they will ruin black's influence.  bP14 might help white secure a big corner, but it also might be a good start for thinking about putting indirect pressure on the wH5 stones.by starting to cutt off the friendly stones on the top side.  However, something like bO4 would probably be needed soon.]
(;B[om];W[mq]
(;B[em];W[gl];B[dh]C[I felt too weak here. Ok? or to passive?

dc: It does seem like a more severe attack on the wH5 stones was called for since they've ruined your influence so much.]
;W[fe]
(;B[fg]C[dc: This function of this move is unclear.  The white stones above and below seem quite solid now.  Trying to develop on the right side maybe be more reasonable at this point.  Black has about 40 points on the left, 10 on the bottom, 20 on the right.  White has about 20 in the upper right, 10 on the top, 20 on the bottom right, 10 on the bottom left.  But white is threaten to get a lot more by consolidating the top, so black has to think about invading somewhere like the top, or reducing the top to get enough central territory to compensate for white consolidating the top.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[eg];B[eh];W[fh];B[lf]C[dc: Now black is playing with better direction, but has taken a loss around bF13.]

(;B[hg]C[The sequence until here seemed ok for black, but from here on, i think I lost it.

dc: The critical error is that you never fully enclose the area you almost-enclose.  Too early is better than too late, even.]
;W[gf]
(;B[gh];W[fi];B[ih];W[gg]
(;B[gi]C[dc: A painful thing to see!  This move does almost nothing locally.]
;W[lk]C[This move appears to win the game for white. Is there any chance left for black at this point?

dc: Yes, black has played aggressively all over on the _top_half_only_ of what should have been great central territory.
At this point, white has about 50 points on the top, and at least 20 on the bottom.  Black has 10 on the right, maybe 40 on the left, 10 on the bottom.  Black is behind maybe 10 points, maybe 20, but it is still feasible to get that in the center -- the problem is white will also get more in the center unless we attack now.  So I think black's only chances lie in aggressive ideas.]
(;B[li]C[Very passive answer, but I couldn't see a better way.

dc: Estimating the score is the way to see how aggressive you need to be.  We know we are behind 10 or 20 points.  We should be trying to cut off some white stones.]
;W[mm];B[pn];W[po];B[oo];W[pp];B[qm];W[og]C[dc: This is a trick play.  You have to be creative to see the tactical possibilities when there are cutting points around.]
(;B[oh];W[qg];B[ph];W[rg];B[rh]C[I couldn't see a better way to keep at least some points...]
;W[rn]
(;B[rm]C[dc: Too passive.  If there is an equal move elsewhere, play that instead of gote.]
;W[nk];B[ok];W[nj];B[oj];W[ik];B[hk];W[hl];B[il]C[feeble attempt because I wanted to gain some points back... Probably a stupid idea?

dc: This is good spirit, but things have progressed by now so that white is stronger locally and it is harder tactically.  However, I think you can't win this game without taking risks and trying things, so I commend this move :)]

(;B[dn];W[ip];B[hp];W[ho]C[dc: The choices of bD6 and then bH4 seem really good to me.  There are a numbef of possible joseki lines now that you could study if you wanted to, but the fight seems to be in black's favor in any case.  A normal robust move from here is bJ3.  In this scenario, bJ5 might be even more severe since black is strong in important surrounding areas -- black wins in any ladder that erupts up-and-right from around bJ5.]

)
(;B[qj]C[dc: If you are more concerned about safety.  This may be best to prevent white from attacking below and getting a large corner enclosure there in sente.  There is also still some potential for black to cause trouble around R17 later.  Even if that corner is still surrended to white, black has more high possibilities, like bO14 building up a wall/moyo later without the P14 and R14 cutting points we see in the game.  In this way, black is less shut in.]
