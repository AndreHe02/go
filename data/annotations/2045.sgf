AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[Hi reviewer,

This is my first time to submit my game for a review.  I am just a beginner and learn go for 1-2 months myself (by reading some web pages, playing in web, and solve some problem on goproblems.com).  It seems that my skill cannot improve much and that's why I want to seek for advice.

I play the white side (ahylau).

thanks.

csh: Strange, but the game information has ahylau as Black. White was able to win this game because he outfought Black. However, there are several strategic mistakes that White made along the way. I will try to point out areas where Black can improve his tactics, as well as where White improve his strategy.]

(;W[qq]C[csh: Starting the game with a 3-3 invasion is bad for White. Black will have more influence (and much more potential territory) from the resulting wall than White will get in the corner. See the variation for another possible opening.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[pn];W[pr];B[or]
(;W[ps]
(;B[os]C[csh: This move still requires a connection later. It's better to make a hanging connection. See the variation.]
;W[rr];B[rs]C[csh: This exchange is a waste by Black. It should be saved for a ko threat later.]
;W[qr];B[nq];W[kq]C[csh: This move is dangerous. Black should pincer and force this stone to run to the center.]

(;B[gq]C[csh: This move is the right idea, but it could be played closer to put more pressure on the white stone. See the variation.]
;W[hr];B[gr];W[hq]
(;B[gs]C[csh: It is much more important for Black to move to the center than to the edge of the board. See the variation.]
;W[jo];B[pj]LB[qj:A][rj:B]C[csh: This extension is the right idea. Perhaps it should be on the third line at A (R10) instead, though. The problem with playing on the fourth line is that there is a weakness at B (S10).]
;W[ln]TR[cj][dj][jc][jd]C[csh: White needs to stabilize this group and then look to make a group at the top or left side of the board. If Black ignores this move and plays on the marked areas, White will be in a lot of trouble.]
;B[mn]LB[jd:D][dj:C][hp:B][lr:A]C[csh: Black, by attaching to the white stone, is strengthening the white group in the ensuing fight. The problem with this move is that Black does not profit while White is solidifying.

It is better to cut at the white group's base (such as A), put pressure on the group from the left (B), or to take a large point elsewhere (C,D).]

(;B[ml]C[csh: Black doesn't need to protect this cut. It is protected by a ladder. There are more important moves elsewhere. See the variation for the ladder.]
;W[jj]C[csh: This jump is not good for White. The white group is already stabilized and should be able to make two eyes, so it does not need to run anymore. It would be much better to establish another group at the top to keep Black from creating a huge framework.]

;B[gd];W[jc];B[md]LB[mc:A][nc:B]TR[md]C[csh: This move should definitely be on the third line at A (N17) or even B (O17), to prevent White from sliding underneath. The advantage of B is that it prepares to seal off the corner.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[lc]
(;B[ma]LB[mc:A]C[csh: Solidly connecting at A (N17) is much better. See variation.]

;W[nh];B[ni];W[mi];B[li];W[oi]TR[ni]C[csh: The marked stone is much more important that the other one in atari. This stone helps connect the ones to the left to the black group on the side.]

(;B[ph];W[nj];B[qc];W[lj];B[jh]C[Here I try to escape the 4 black from white, but cannot success, should I put J12 instead of K12?

csh: At this point, the stones are already cut off. They have no friendly groups to connect to.]

(;B[ca]TR[fc][hc][he][ia][gd][hd][id][hb][ib]C[csh: This stone isn't connected to anything. What's worse, White can still cut at F18 to make a second eye. The cut is even more dangerous than that because it threatens to kill the marked black stones. It's better to connect solidly. See the variation.]

;W[bj]C[This later steps are the only part that I win the battle.  However, I think the opponent can play better.  Am I right?  Or his moves are already the best move?

csh: I don't think White needs to invade to win the game. Black is already really strong in this area, so it would be hard to live.]

C[csh: Again, this doesn't really help you. Hane and then connect. Playing like this can ruin your potential for later (ajikeshi). If you are unsure of a kill, don't play until you can read it out.]

;W[pf];B[fg];W[gi];B[aa];W[ba]C[csh: Black needs to concentrate on not being cut apart. White exploited several weaknesses to cut apart and ultimately kill several groups.

White needs to work on playing lightly, and establishing a base and then moving on to other parts of the board. Handicap games are difficult, but trying to improve strategy instead of just relying on fighting strength will help to improve one's game.

I hope you find this review helpful.])

(;B[iq];W[ko];B[io];W[km];B[im];W[kk];B[cp]C[csh: Playing here prevents the 3-3 invasion in the lower left.

Black can make much more than that in the lower left.]

(;W[rr];B[iq]C[csh: This extension, along with Black's wall, is much better than White's corner. White has maybe 8 points in the corner, while Black has the potential to make three times as much. Black can further enlarge his framework by jumping towards the center (J5). White, on the other hand, is sealed off and cannot increase his territory. This result is the main reason why the 3-3 invasion is bad in the opening.]

;B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[qk]C[csh: White's group is now stabilized along the side and can still develop towards the center. While the amount of points for White may be more or less the same, this is a much better result for White since Black does not have a strong wall to use at the bottom.]
