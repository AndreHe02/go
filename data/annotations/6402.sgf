C[Bokudo: Greetings to the reviewer, thankyou for the time you've spent on this reviw.

This is a review for both myself and my opponent, so if you can comment on both of us it would be greatly appreciated. :)

Hi. I'm Danny and I just reviewed your game. I put some comments and possible variations. I didn't put continuations for all my suggestions. Study them and see what works. During games, try to find moves that are multi-purpose. Keep your groups alive and or connected. Don't attack weak groups if your stones aren't strong enough to stay connected or look like they can be killed. Have fun and take care.]
