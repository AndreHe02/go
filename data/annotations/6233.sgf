C[Dear Mymoyo,

part of your own commentary is in German, but in order to reach a broader audience on GTL, I will be so free as to translate into English.
I am Amygdala, 1d. 

Henceforth, I will mark your annotations with "M:" and mine with "A:".

M:
I get a great moyo but make a mistake K14, while trying to tackle the inimical invasion.]

(;B[pp]C[A:
On a real board, the first move should be played in the upper right corner as a matter of politeness. White will have it more comfortable to answer and does not have to reach over the whole board to play a kakari, if he chooses to do so. Violating this customs means either that you are being impolite deliberately or that you are so rude that you not even know the basics.]

;W[re];B[qf]C[M:
My own joseki, to build up influence at the right edge.

A:
If  "my own" means that you brag of being the first to have played it, in this special case you are mistaken. This move might come to one's mind quite easily according to circumstances. Since 3-3 point josekis got popular, professionals have played it occasionally. As an example, see the game played in the first Gosei-League between Kobayashi Koichi and Kato Masao on 8.2.1976. After all, it is a good idea to play moves in corner exchanges that look feasible to you even if you have never seen them before. Actually, that is the way new josekis are invented! Just for the sake of modesty be sure that not many sensible moves in standard corner exchanges have been left unplayed over the last 3000 years of go history!]

(;B[of]LB[pf:B][og:A]C[A:
This does not belong to any of the established sequences. It is NOT joseki at all. Joseki moves are A or B. See branches for examples!]

If white jumps out now (at A), still black will have gained only a little.]
;B[qi]LB[ri:A]C[A:
Now the right edge is still open and "your joseki" is not a great success so far. It would be great, however, if you were the one to play A!]
;W[kd];B[je]TR[od][oe][of][oh]LB[ej:A]C[A:
Not a proper move. This area is of little value as it is already influenced by the black wall (triangled). It only strengthens white now. Better at A.]

Now the two triangled walls are facing each other and mutually neutralize their effects. They are too close to each other and therefore they are ineffective.]

Bad. This cut did not pose any danger.

A:
Really timid and docile. I would have chosen A instead to keep the white stones seperated. If white turns at B at any time, he will stay short of liberties in the ensuing fight (i.e. after black C).]

A nice game after all. You already play quite well. One of your major weaknesses seems to be a propensity to defensive moves when there a none necessary. Try to "think forward": try to capture cutting stones rather than protect passively!]

The right idea now. "If you can cut, do so." For my opinion about the best way to play for white, refer to my suggestion for w16.]
