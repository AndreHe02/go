C[Thank you for reviewing my game. I played White and lost on time. (I was
 somewhat behind at the end.)
 My opponent played a "busy" game, and I often wasn't sure what was the most
 important area on the board.
 Please also let me know if you have any ideas for how White could continue at
 the end.

[DP Hello there.  I don't think you were as behind as you may have felt at the end.  The main problem was the weak white group bottom centre, which should have been your priority had the game continued. 

As for the importance of the various moves, you are quite right not to follow your opponent around the board, but things like incomplete joseki are rarely best punished immediately.  Let the game develop and the missing move will haunt your opponent in the middle game.

When attacking, try to avoid contact moves - use the principal of taking profit whilst attacking - in other words your attacking stones should be building up a framework for YOU as well as harrassing your opponent\]]
;B[pq];W[pd];B[cd];W[cp];B[qf];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[dm]C[[DP This is an interesting move from B.  More usual would be to either a) finish the joseki with R11 b) make a shimari in either corner or c) an E4 kakari against C4.  Personally I would probably prefer c) and play at E4, since it would work well with the stones already played\]]

(;W[qh]LB[ep:A]C[Black has a large follow-up at A, but I decided to immediately try to
 punish Black for leaving the joseki unfinished.

[DP You are right that the incomplete joseki should be punished, but the question is when?  As you say A is very large point, possibly more urgent than big - so it needs to be played immediately, forming a shimari and putting a lot of pressure on D7.  A is so big because the original B kakari is from the wrong side.\]]
;B[pg]C[[DP This is sensible by B, escaping into the centre.  The W pincer is really a bit too close.  To finish the joseki B would have played R11 - so go with the adage that your opponent's best point is your best point. See variation from node 9.\]]

(;W[ph]C[[DP This is too close.  Contact plays are essentially defensive, and you want to be doing the attacking here.  The result of playing like this will be that B gets a chance to make shape and live easily, and your stones, which still do not have a base, become heavy and vulnerable to attack themselves.  You really need to extend here immediately to give your stones a base\]]
;B[ng];W[oh]C[Am I playing too close?

[DP I've only just got to this comment!  Yes :-)  See node 9.  But what is the result of playing too close?  Two things really - a) you are inadvertently helping B make shape to live and b) strengthening him in the process.  That doesn't sound too bad, but the problem is that your Q16 stones are not getting any stronger, and so you are accidentally building B up ready to attack them.  Also, until Q12 have a base, they too are also vulnerable.  Because B is now becoming strong, you need to play on both sides, and that is difficult!\]]
;B[nf]
(;W[qn]C[I make a slight overextension to prevent a Black shimari.
 Was there a profitable way to continue the attack instead?

[DP You shouldn't be too worried about him making a shimari, since you can play in front of it next to prevent him getting an ideal extension. See variation from previous node\]]
;B[pl]C[[DP B is taking advantage of his *strong* Q13 group now!\]]
;W[on];B[nl];W[qk]LB[qk:B][pl:A]C[I almost always avoid this type of move
 as bad style, but I did not see a better option.

[DP This is probably one of your better options now - the reason you're being forced into a corner so that you have to play this move stems from R12 and Q12\]]
;B[ql]
(;W[rl]C[[DP By forcing the sequence to 25, you make B strong here and weaken R6 and P6\]]

(;B[rn]C[Black is happy to connect.

[DP Yes, but see previous node\]];W[li]C[[DP Good!  You've seen the danger and responded well\]]
;B[le];W[kq]C[It would be painful for Black to follow his last move by
 shutting in my group at the top. However, responding there would leave the
 bottom group very weak.]
(;B[eq]C[[DP B should probably have gone for S17 here instead - it's sente, since if W ignores it he will die.  See variation from previous node\]]
;W[ep]C[[DP Good, you're under attack here, so a defensive contact move is correct.  Allows you to build shape to live, whilst keeping B separated.  B should have played E4\]]
;B[fp];W[eo];B[dq];W[cq];B[cn];W[co];B[iq]
(;W[cr]C[[DP This should be a pincer around D10.  Up until here you had handled it nicely keeping B separated.  Inevitably he can protect one group, which he did with J10.  You should immediately jump on the other to take advantage of your original separation move at E4\]]
;B[dr];W[ec];B[gc];W[df]C[Apparently not joseki with this pincer.  The idea was
 a possible sacrifice to prevent Black from getting a large framework.

[DP If the idea is to sacrifice E17 to build up an attack on D7 stones, then it is a good one\]]
;B[ed];W[dd];B[dc];W[de];B[fc];W[ce]LB[cc:A]C[Cut at A? Somehow I overlooked
 this during the game.

[DP I'd extend to C10 or D10 instead now, and start the attack, leaving C17 or C15 for later\]]
;B[cc];W[eb]C[Intending to leave aji, but probably had the opposite effect.

[DP :-)  well, we all do it at some point!  Though see note later when L18 is on offer around move 94\]]
;B[fe];W[ci]C[[DP For once, this is not aggressive enough.  B can make nice shape with C9 from here\]]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[cl];W[lc]C[[DP Good, this is a big point - S17 is no longer sente for B now\]]
;B[rc]
(;W[rb]C[[DP You don't need to answer this - see variation from previous node\]]
;B[mq]C[This was long expected,
 but I didn't try to prevent it since I felt there was little territory in the
area.

[DP Territory is not the point in this area.  It's the weak W stones which need strengthening\]]
;W[mp]
(;B[lp]C[[DP This is an overplay by B, which allows you eventually to capture at N3 and so survive.  If B is meaner and nastier, see what happens from previous node :-)\]]
;W[lq];B[np];W[mo];B[no];W[nq]C[[DP Good - this gets you out of trouble here\]]
;B[mn];W[mr];B[lo];W[jp]C[[DP Again good, keeping B separated\]]
;B[mq];W[mp];B[jq];W[kp];B[gr]
(;W[ip]C[[DP Doesn't achieve much since B is already strong here.  Getting out with K6 probably better\]]
;B[hp];W[jm];B[dj]C[Perhaps I missed a chance to attack the group of stones Black is now
strengthening.

[DP Yep, straight after the E4 sequence earlier, but we've done that already\]]
;W[di];B[kc]
(;W[mc]C[Too submissive?

[DP Probably.  You could force a bit with L16 or L18\]];B[kd]
;W[ie]C[I'm not sure about this.
 However, one more move would give Black a formidible territory at the top.

[DP This is fine - you have presence in the centre with M11, D11 and K7, so you'll be able to run in one direction or the other.  It's a good move\]]
;B[ig]
(;W[hg]C[[DP Just run away with H14 instead - see variations from previous node\]]
;B[if];W[hf];B[he];W[ge];B[hd];W[ff]C[[DP The right kind of idea, linking to strong stones - but J15 did not need to be sacrificed\]]

;B[an];W[fo];B[gp];W[fl];B[hh];W[ee];B[fd];W[gh];B[gg]C[Doesn't work, but Black gets a good
 point at the end of the sequence.

[DP B's biggest move now is probably something like L18 putting pressure on the top R group\]]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[dg];B[eh];W[ei];B[gj];W[fi];B[hm]
;W[fm]C[Dame - I thought Black a3 would reduce the corner to one eye.

[DP W is safe from A3 as you worked out.  Can be hard to see in the pressure of a game though!  What you should be aware of is how strong a move H7 is, putting pressure on the bottom centre W group\]]

;B[ma];W[oa];B[pc];W[qd];B[re];W[ka];B[ib];W[ja];B[ia]C[[DP so, how to continue from here?  Let's get an idea of the score first.  Be generous to your opponent and harsh on yourself when doing this.  Approximate to nearest 5 points
B - top left 25; bottom right 15; bottom centre 10; left centre 5  TOTAL 55
W - top right 20; centre right 5; bottom centre 5; bottom left 5; centre left 15; komi 5 TOTAL 55
So, it's VERY close. Checking the health of the groups, the bottom centre group is in a lot of danger, so a move to help it should be your priority]
