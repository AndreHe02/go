C[Hello Janus my name is Taylor I will be going over this game giving for black if you feel as tough you have any questions when you get your SGF back please feel free to email me and ask at litteral_taylor@yahoo.com]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[cp];W[ep];B[eq]LB[pd:A]C[I repsonded to move 4 because I felt it was the right thing to do, but would it have been better for me to try and take stake out the remaining corner with a move like A?

Here you can play either way there is no wrong answer its mostly a personal prefrence thing but you should know that ignoring whites E4 stone to take the corner at A can lead to a big fight in the bottom left corner.]

(;B[cb];W[dc];B[db];W[cc];B[ed]LB[ff:A]C[probably should have tried to escape with A instead of this move]

[fd]SQ[ci][ei][cj][ej][dk][fk][bl][dl][fl][fm][go]C[Okay overall it was a solid game you will improve with the minor stuff over time like dealing with that type of corner where you have to decide to run or fight and make life or picking terrotory over influence and slowly you will learn how to reduce your opponent so they don't end up with large spaces like this. Just keep playing and have fun playing also if you are not doing it yet try doing go problems they can help you improve in reading out variations I hope I was able to help. :)]

(;B[cc]C[While you can play at A and live with the right variation in most cases white gets a lot of influence on the borad and a very larg outside which can be troublesome if you are not good at reducing and fighting.]
