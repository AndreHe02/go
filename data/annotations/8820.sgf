C[Hi! I'm Saurus, 3 kyu on KGS.

I have reviewed this game for white.

This was a difficult game to review, since you won quite convincingly, and it was therefore difficult to demonstrate where you went wrong, as your particular moves may have worked in this particular game. Therefore, rather than pointing out mistakes, I have tried to point out where you have deviated from theory, or where I felt another move would have been even more effective.

I have marked all my comments with [Saurus\], and wherever I have offered variations on a move, I have marked [See variation.\]

The way I have reviewed this game is from my understanding as a 3k. Perhaps a stronger player may review differently, but I have merely commented according to my understanding of the game.


I have also given a summary of key concepts that you need to focus on at the end of the game.

Regards
Mark

[jq]C[[Saurus\]: This is bad if white does not have a stone around the area marked with a triangle. 

The problem with this move if a white stone is absent from the marked area is that it allows black to strengthen his f3 stone and make a base. The reason why this is bad is because as soon as black has a base, a corner 3-3 invasion will be successful. I will show this in a few moves time.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jp];W[qf]LB[ce:C][nc:B][qn:A]C[[Saurus\]: I don't like this move. Ideally, black wants to make an extension from the bottom right corner, so that the bottom right corner becomes hard to invade effectively. Forcing black to play a pincer is forcing him to do exactly what he wants.

I much prefer a play at either:
A, which prevents black from making a double-wing extension.
B, which is an ideal extension from d17, and aims at developing the top for white.
C, which cashes in some point immediately, and makes a strong base from which to attack black should he play a stone along the top.]
(;B[qh]LB[cq:A]C[[Saurus\]: R12 is great for black.

I have also showed here how black can invade the bottom left corner at A, although this should probably played a bit later in the game, since there are still many bigger moves on the board.

(See variation.)]
(;W[of]LB[qc:A]C[[Saurus\]: W-p14 is playable, but professionals regard it as slightly better for Black, bacause after the joseki sequence, white has to come back and defend at q13, which is slow, and gote.

Playing at A is by far the most common joseki after the pincer.

(See variation.)];B[nd];W[pi]C[This is the only joseki response to pincer that I know. I am not sure if there is a better joseki sequence to play here.

[Saurus\]: After choosing w-p14, this is the best continuation.]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[ql]
(;W[ce]LB[om:A]C[I thought Q13 wasn't urgent since even if he surrounds R14 stone, there will be plenty of aji. Am I right?

[Saurus\]: Yes, q13 is not urgent, because if b-q13 now, white can still 3-3 after the joseki.
However, it is very big, because if black takes the corner with b-r16, for example, then white must play p13 in gote, unless there is a bigger move on the board. 

Thus, q13 is very big, but not urgent.

However, with the black q3 stone present, allowing b-q8 now is just too much. Black will get an enormous un-invadable corner and white's outside influence will be gone. Therefore, white must complete the joseki at A (w-p17).

(See variation.)];B[jc]C[[Saurus\]: Very good play by black.

This stone is a must, since black now needs to make territory from his high corner, since its outside influence is no longer of much use.]
(;W[di]LB[ck:C][cj:B][hc:A]C[[Saurus\]: A play at A (w-h17) is MUCH better than d11 now. It is sente, because playing at h17 gives support to an invasion at m17, making such an invasion very effective. Black must respond.

(See variation.)


Even locally, a low stone at B or C would have been better than the high stone since it starts to turn the bottom left into territory. Without it, a black invasion bottom left will probably still live underneath.]
;B[pg]C[And he does surround!];W[og]C[[Saurus\]: Good.];B[pf]
;W[hd]LB[hc:A][qc:B]C[[Saurus\]: Playing low at A (h17) is better, because after playing high, black can slide underneath at h18, making white uncomfortable after the invasion at m17.)

(See variation on next move.)

However, it should be noted that after black pushes through at q14, the 3-3 invasion at B is a normal response by white.]
(;B[pl]C[[Saurus\]: Excellent move by black!

(But see variation as to why previous move by white was not ideal.)]
;W[ol]C[[Saurus\]: Yes, it's horrible to have to play this now (although it is necessary.) This is as a failure to finish the joseki with p7 earlier.]
;B[hc]C[[Saurus\]: Huge mistake by black!

You are so lucky that black did not play at p7 now, which would have probably changed the outcome of the game.]
;W[gc]C[[Saurus\]: If you were going to play low, then why not play low in the first place!]
;B[hb];W[id]C[[Saurus\]: Good!

This prevents black from making shape.];B[jd];W[om]C[[Saurus\]: Excellent judgement! 

Nice recovery and capitalizing on black's mistake of leaving the scene of the fight!]
;B[ck]C[[Saurus\]: This invasion is too deep.

Black is too concerned with trying to destroy white's territory, when he could make much more by developing his own, for example, bottom right.]
;W[cm]C[[Saurus\]: White plays very well for the next few moves.]
;B[ek];W[ci]C[[Saurus\]: Iron pillar - Good, solid play!];B[bl]
;W[bm];B[bj];W[bi];B[ai];W[ah];B[aj];W[bg];B[el];W[fn];B[fj]
;W[fh]C[[Saurus\]: The last few moves by white were very nice, making territory out of chasing black.

White is ahead now.];B[gl];W[hn];B[go];W[gn];B[ho]
(;W[lq]LB[po:A]C[[Saurus\]: Big Mistake!

Now you are playing too deep in black's sphere of influence, and such play will almost always turn your stone into an under-achiever, with dire negative consequences.

I prefer a play at A (q5).

(See variation.)];B[nq];W[lo];B[kq];W[lp];B[pn]C[[Saurus\]: See, now black has the corner, and white's m-group is feeling rather unsafe.

Black has suddenly regained the lead which you recently took from him.

This is a very important lesson of which you should take special notice - so far, whenever someone has invaded too deeply, it has immediately resulted in the other person taking the lead. This is ususally the case in Go.]
;W[iq]C[My intention is not to kill. I am trying to see if I can get anything out of it.

[Saurus\]: Such plays are usually risky, as black may not have to respond, which means you will end in gote.]
;B[kr];W[lr];B[ip];W[hq]C[[Saurus\]: Why are you so determined to take gote?]
;B[in];W[im]
(;B[jn]C[[Saurus\]: I think black could have cut.

[Saurus\]: OK.];B[gh];W[fg];B[dj];W[gb];B[no];W[nn];B[oo];W[qc]
C[[Saurus\]: Black should not have allowed this.];B[qd];W[rd]
;B[re];W[rc];B[qe]C[What is the better outcome? Living in the corner or attacking mid-left? I thought the latter would be better.

[Saurus\]: I agree.]
(;W[oc]C[[Saurus\]: P18 is the proper way to live in this position if you wish to live in the corner.

(See variation.)];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa];B[rb]
;W[od];B[mc];W[kb];B[jb];W[ne];B[mb]
(;W[me]LB[oe:A]C[[Saurus\]: I think this is a gross strategic error. You are ahead and therefore should not allow the ko at p15. If you lose it, you may lose the game. Simply connect at A (p15).]
;B[ic]C[[Saurus\]: I think black should have started the ko. There are big ko threats at m6 and its follow-up moves, and at c3, for example.]
(;W[lc]LB[ld:A]C[[Saurus\]: This is bizarre. If you want to threaten to connect, do it from your living group at A. Still, I don't see the point.

The theory says you should make territory from threatening to kill unless you can read out the kill.
This is important, or you will come out with nothing except cutting points or weaknesses.

Remember: Attack to gain points; killing should be always plan B.

(See variation)];B[ld];W[ma];B[lb];W[la];B[kc];W[ka];B[ja];W[na]
;B[md];W[se]C[I couldn't kill and I was really upset because I felt like I couldn't get much advantage. On top of that there is big ko left at Q15-P15. So this made me really upset.

[Saurus\]: It is because you tried to kill without being able to read it out. See my previous comment.]
(;B[sc]C[[Saurus\]: It is unthinkable that black didn't start the ko now. Black will surely kill the m4 group if he does.

(See variation)];W[oe]C[[Saurus\]: The only move.];B[li]C[And I cannot make much territory in the center because of the previous move.

Simply play at A (f18) to avoid yose ko threats.];B[le];W[mf]

(;W[mr]C[[Saurus\]: Since the game is in yose, I would probably have taken the one point profit before defending, as I cannot see any important kos arising any more.

;W[fs];B[dm];W[cn];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt]C[There really isn't much that you did wrong in this game, as far as my understanding goes, but there are two general themes of concern which repeated themselves in this game - both which changed the course of the game:

1) Be careful of invading too deeply without support. It will always be chased and your opponent will always make territory from chasing it from both sides. Both players were guilty of this in the game, and both times, it led to the other player taking the lead.

2) Be careful of playing high stones in fuseki without good cause. Of course, balance between high and low stones is important, but one should always have the purpose of the stones in mind. Twice, you simply played high to preserve the balance, while low stones would have been much better. I think you should focus your fuseki studies on when to play high and when to play low.

Other than that, it was a very good game, and I hope my comments helped.
