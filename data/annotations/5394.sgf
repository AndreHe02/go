C[I am Amygdala, 2k+ on IGS, and will do the review for you. I can only offer suggestions and comments, but none of these can claim the absolute truth. I will do my very best and I will mark my comments with "A:", yours with "B:".

B:
Dear Reviewer, this is my game on KGS i'm playing BLACK in this game and lost by komi. can you pls tell where did i go wrong ?  THANKS]

Most professionals would prefer the moves c15 or c6, which go for a calmer development, but your choice is also okay and cannot be criticized.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[cn];W[np]C[A:
So far this fuseki was at least played once before: by Che Zewu as black player and Yang Hui as white player in the 5th Tianyuan 1991-02-07. In that match, black played f3 next, which goes for a quicker development. Congratulations, it stands for sound judgement if pros have played your fuseki before!]

correct move ? or i should play at M4

Both are possible. Your choice looks nice and solid, m4 can get a little complicated. See variations. All in all, I like your move best.]

C[A:
Not good, I think. This move threatens nothing and hardly gains any points.]
;W[br];B[cf]C[A:
Nice. The shimari is worth a lot and the ogeima extension is good because it checks the influence that white gains from his wall below.]

Here I would still prefer something like r10.];W[qf]
(;B[ph]C[B:
correct move ?

A:
I do not think so. I would prefer a calmer pace. See variations. Probably this is even the origin of your defeat. In a way, it is too close to white's atsui below and will hunt white into your moyo. This is only good if you can be sure to capture white.]

Better at n10. n10 leaves no aji. Anyway, the local result on the right side so far is good for black: white has not gained enough from his influence on the right side, and the upper right group is overconcentrated. But...]

correct move ?

A:

This one only helps white to solidify his group. Regard the proverb "Do not touch weak groups". Better hunt them and take territory while attacking. Keep threats in reserve.]

correct move ? trying too attack 2 white stones

A:
The most simple move is often the best. I like d10 better, see variations.]

(;B[ci]C[A:
After white's way to deal with the problem, black ends fine. It is hard to believe that there should be no way to capture the three white stones with some kind of tesuji: but indeed I did not find one. Maybe you should present this situation to even a stronger player and ask his advice. Be sure to let me know the solution!]

ok i think that's it for my game, thanks for the review

A:
A nice game. I can summarize my advice as follows:
Try to omit slack moves like b27.
Try to improve your sense of direction. b31 and b33 went wrong as far as that part of strategic concepts is concerned. You can work at it if you replay at least 100 professional games not older than from the seventies at least up to move 50. See what sides the pros chose for attacking and extending.
Try to eliminate bad shape as with b49. In fact, bad shape is often like not playing at all, like passing. To avoid bad shape, it is necessary to plan some few moves ahead, like: if I will have to defend here later, will my stone stand in a nice position? Avoiding bad shape for good will make you improve at least three stones in one instance.
The sequence from 57-90 stabilized white's group and hunted that strong group into your own moyo.
Try to improve your sense of dealing with the opponent's weak groups. If you have not already done so, read Ishida Akira's "Attack and Defense"!
I think you have good potential and you will improve pretty soon!]
