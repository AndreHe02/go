;B[dd];W[cc];B[cd];W[ee];B[ag]C[opponent's a2 or b1 or b2 will enable eliminating this stone]

(;W[bg]C[b2 would be better, because it guarantees the possibility of killing a1 and any potential extension of it anyway, and such position is safer for the white.  a sequence of black a2, a3, a4 etc followed by white b3, b4, b5 etc would be futile for the black and fairly productive for the white (see variation 2)]

C[... despite white's past victories];W[db];B[ed];W[eb];B[ae]
C[not necessary. The corner is clear for the black, while along the upper side a white group is almost complete and ready to extend]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[fe]TR[gd]C[enables a link at g4 (unless the black take this point, which he'd better do). this would enable winning much territory around g1, which attractive for both sides]

(;B[ac]LB[bc:a]C[ would be more efficient here (see var)];W[bb]
;B[ba]C[too aggressive, doomed to die alone in the corner];W[ca]

;W[gd]C[okay - accomplished];B[ea]C[no future for this stone]
;W[da]C[could wait. it made no threat while right bottom waits open for conquerors]
;B[ba];W[cb];B[ef];W[aa];B[fg];W[dg];B[ba]C[left upper corner is of minor importance: no chance of an eye, and just one point difference]

C[white is in danger];W[bg]LB[gc:a]C[no way
black has two eyes, which makes him practically immortal    a would secure the f2 group instead]
;B[gc];W[af];B[ba]LB[fb:a][ga:b]C[black's a followed by b would make white extinct]
;W[gd]LB[ge:a]C[now i would advise black to do a
to close the gate for white and to try again...];B[ff]MA[dg]
[cg][bg][bf][af][ag]TR[bd][gg]C[now black is immortal
two single eyes (triangled) make any attempt at a1 vacancies totally futile]
;W[aa];B[fe];W[cg]C[.];B[ba];W[bf];B[aa];W[gc]C[now white in right upper corner is safe]
;B[ge]C[from now on  no change of the situation on the board is possible
THE RESULT IS FIXED

I suggest that both players:
1. think how is it possible that future events are of no importance and draw conclusions
2. find more futile moves throughout the game than those pointed out; any better ideas?


Good luck];W[dg];B[ag];W[bg];B[dg];W[af]C[no gain for the white]

   White = 3 territory + 13 living stones + 0 dame + 5.5 komi = 21.5
   Black = 4 territory + 29 living stones + 0 dame = 33
Black wins by 11.5.])
