C[Hi Calvin!

My name is Rainer (Beholder) from Germany (8-9k).
I hope my comments will help you in your future games ;-)

All in all it was a nice game. You lost the game because you didn't invade Black's territory at all, but tried to reduce it from outside.

Best regards

Rainer];B[qp];W[dd]C[I am white.  -Calvin];B[jj]C[My opponent's fuseki is a little unorthodox.

Rainer: I agree. It is not consistend with B1.];W[pd];B[jd]
C[Rainer: It looks like Black would like to play something like the Great Wall, but B1 (R4) doesn't fit into the concept at all...]
;W[oq]C[Rainer: Why don't you take the still open corner in the lower left? If Black plays the cornenr enclosure P3 after that, you can still negate a lot of influence by playing around Q10.]
;B[lp];W[on]C[Rainer: After this move Black doesn't finish the joseki.]

(;B[op];W[cq]LB[np:A]TR[oq]C[I thought that taking the corner with W10 is fairly large.   Black would need to play an extra move to remove the aji of the marked stone anyway.

Rainer: I think this move is a bit defensive. A move at 3-4 or 4-4 would be better this early in the game.]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[do];W[er];B[gp];W[np]SQ[do][dp][gp][lp]C[I can now continue the joseki on the right.

Rainer: But only for a price. The marked black stones give a lot of strenth to the tengen stone now. The joseki in the lower left also supports the tengen stone.]
;B[pq];W[oo];B[pp];W[mp];B[nq];W[lo]LB[mn:B][mq:A]C[I am saving the push at A for later.  Right now I want to counter black's influence a bit.   However, jumping at B might be better shape here.  I'm not sure.

Rainer: You have to protect the cut. If you do it like you did or with a play at B is a question of how you want to continue to play in the game. I, personally, would have prefered B, because the shape would be a bit more settled.]
;B[mq];W[ko];B[kp];W[lc]LB[jo:A]SQ[on][ko][lo][oo][mp][np]C[This is a big area but continuing the pushing battle at A is somewhat distasteful, giving black fourth line territory.   It is probably mistake because allowing the hane at A is worse than the compensation I can get at the top.  Or maybe not.  Not sure.

Rainer: This is a big move, but the marked white stones are still vulnerable.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[kc]LB[ke:A][co:B]C[This move by black is not so good because it helps me make an ideal shape.   I think black sohuld just play the kosumi at A, which is thick and works better with his central strategy.  But hey, I lost this game so who am I to judge? :-)

Rainer: The contact play by Black is a mistake. Black should continue the joseki in the lower left with B.]
;W[ld];B[co]LB[bn:A][fp:B]C[This is a big move, made possible by the fact that I didn't slide at A earlier.  There is a joseki continuation at B, but I didn't know it at the time.]
;W[hc]LB[bd:A][kf:B]TR[kc][jd]C[I didn't want to simply take the corner with A.   I decide to attack black's two marked stones instead.  This attack is probably flawed.  First of all, black has the stone at the tengen to run to, so taking his base isn't a big deal.   Maybe the direction of B is better.

Rainer: This is not much of an attack. And there are still bigger point on the board. The right side is still open, so a play at around R10 would be big. Or a pincer play at C12 would be interesting, too.]

;B[ff];W[qj]LB[qc:A][be:B][if:E][fp:C][hq:D]C[Black's group is safe now, so I tenuki.  However, this is a poor choice.   First of all, the right side is undercut by the two marked black stones int the bottom right.  Also, black is about to invade at R17 (A) and make my double-wing overconcentrated.   Other possibly better choices I think are protecting the upper left corner at B, settling the lower right white group with C or D, or playing the big shape move at E.

Rainer: I don't think this move is poor. If Black plays 3-3 at R17 you build influence down the right side, so R10 is ideal. The upper left corner can be reduced, but the white stones are in no danger. Both C and D would fortify Blacks moyo on the left side.]
;B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[nc];W[od];B[mb];W[pb]
;B[na];W[qb];B[lb];W[qn]C[Now I felt I had to protect my investment on the right.  It is distasteful to have to play like this.

Rainer: A play at R6 reduces the possible moyo of Black in the lower right, but White is wide open for invasion.]
;B[re];W[rd]LB[rc:A]C[Simply capturing at A is usually stronger.

Rainer: I agree.];B[qi];W[pi];B[pj]C[Black as attempting to make sabaki in my moyo.]
;W[qk];B[oi];W[ph];B[oh];W[qh];B[og]C[Rainer: With this move Black has already achieved what he intended to do, reduce your moyo considerably. Now you have to invade to win the game.]
;W[qf]C[This move is small.  I probably should have played tenuki.

Rainer: Yes.];B[pe];W[qe];B[pg];W[qg];B[nd];W[ne]C[Also small.

Rainer: Much too small. You have to invade.];B[me];W[nf]C[The sequence which follows is quite damaging to white I think.

Rainer: Black is cutting off your stones and building a bigger and bigger moyo.]
;B[mf];W[mg];B[ng];W[oe];B[lg];W[mh]TR[ng][og][pg][oh][oi]C[Rainer: I am not sure why Black sacrifices the marked stones.]

;B[hp];W[iq];B[cl];W[ef]LB[be:A][ce:B]C[I have a bit of a problem.  I don't think it is sufficient to protect white's corner with A or B now.   If we start yose now I think black is 10-15 points ahead.   I attempt to break into black's territory to do some erasure.

Rainer: I think Black is more than 20 points ahead.];B[eg];W[fg]
