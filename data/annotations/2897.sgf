;B[cf]C[Normally taking the last corner would be bigger.  White could easily ignore this move and take it himself.]

(;W[cn]C[Very strange move for white.]
(;B[ci]
(;W[ck];B[cd]C[I don't like this move much, you help white strengthen D16 too much.  Play B16 as in the previous variation.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dp]C[Should I have responded to c17, or was changing directions a good idea?

If you didn't plan to answer white C17, why did you play C16?  This is a very bad idea.  Locally in this corner, I would play lower since white already has a base nearby.]
;W[fq];B[eo];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[I think you should block the other side.  See variation.]
;W[dq];B[gp];W[ep];B[fp];W[eq];B[do]C[One of the people watching this said it was a bad idea. Do you have any idea why?

Maybe because that thought you should block the other way.  Or maybe because D5 is bad shape, although it's hard to avoid in this situation.]

(;W[hq]
(;B[jq]C[too far? I thought of M3/L3, but they seeemd too shallow

Locally its a good point, especially since you threaten to follow up with G2.  But on the entire board, I would be concerned about the upper left group.]
;W[ip]
(;B[lp];W[qn]
(;B[ql]C[Wrong direction.  Your R14 stone is very solid, but low.  So it's hard to make many points on the right side.  Instead defend the corner.]
;W[on]
(;B[qi]C[I know, I know. O4];W[np];B[nq]C[is there any better way to defend? N3/P3 cut off one group or the other. THis seemed like the only way to hope saving both groups by connecting

O3 is the normal move when you are weak.];W[mq]
(;B[oq]C[This is not normal though, you should cut.];W[mp];B[rp]
;W[mr];B[nr]C[turned out pretty well for me I think

I disagree.  You only got 14 points in the corner.  L3/M4 almost dead, and white P6/R6/O4 are pretty strong.]

(;W[ln]
(;B[jo]
(;W[jp]
(;B[hr]C[Is this a bad idea? I was expecting him to extend J5 or jump to J6, rather than push. My goal was to trick him into letting me connect with the E5 group or even make a base. Should I have not bothered, and jumped out with the e5 group instead?

Yes bad.  Never try trick moves, when they don't work it just makes your position worse.  Realistically you should treat K3/M4 lightly, saving them is too costly.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[hp]
(;B[ho]C[stupid idea? I cant tell at all

You really hurt yourself with H2/J3.  Its getting harder and harder to get a good result here.  Probably now you should be leaning on C7/C9 directly.]
;W[io];B[hn];W[fo]C[H5 was probably pretty bad consider this is what happened. How should I have avoided this?]

(;B[go];W[fn];B[fd]C[Only good attack I could think of. I had no idea what to do about G5/E5 group. Is this attack to low, and I should've hit F17 or even E18 instead?

This is like a desperation move.  Black has weak groups everywhere, and now creates yet another.  But Black's game is destroyed here.  I don't have any reasonable suggestions.]
;W[ec];B[gc];W[ie];B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff]C[White cuts since he is strong.]
;B[ed]C[Alright. I had 25 seconds to make three moves when I did this, which is why it turned out this badly. Regardless, how should I have handled this attack? Theres not enough room to make a base, and running would give him a lot of profit regardless.

Its pretty grim looking for black.];W[de];B[gf];W[fg];B[gg]
;W[fh];B[hh];W[jg];B[lf]C[I thought the group was settled for the moment. Running would just give him more profit, and probably eventually kill me. I thought if I could cut into the area he had just took, I might have a chance.

Incredible that you would think you are safe enough to create even another group?!]
;W[nf];B[lh];W[ji]C[I didn't realize this one move would threaten both running groups so well. Either I run left, and lose the profit I had just tried to take from W, or run right, lose just as much profit, and all those stones as well]
