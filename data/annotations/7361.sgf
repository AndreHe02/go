C[Hey mr. reviewer,

I added some specific comments and questions to the SGF. I also added some general ones at the end of the game.]

EmTom: Because it is a bit odd in this position. Its not joseki as far as I know.]

;W[nb];B[mc]
(;W[kc]LB[gc:A][qm:B][dp:C]C[right time for nose play ?

EmTom: It seems a bit too ambitious for me... Im not sure what did you try to do with it. If you want to attack black its better to cut but since black is going to have this problem in the future maybe now is too early to do it. Maybe its better to prepare the attack first. If black defends at some point you gain one move elsewhere. 

A seems ok as it helps to attack black for sure. B looks ok as it makes black group on the right uncomfortable. C would give you some thickness on the outside that would help any fight and since black has some shape problems maybe you would be able to use this thickness in the future.]

(;W[ie]LB[hd:A]C[EmTom: I dont like this move. Theres a weakness at A so black can try something. Also black can enter whites position on the 2nd line.]

(;B[fc];W[ib];B[kb];W[ec];B[fe]
(;W[gd]C[EmTom: Ouch... You make black stronger and cut your own groups. Now blacks thickness is getting usefull. You should have connected below (see variation).]
;B[fd]C[was that a good way to answer f17 ? i have made him heavy

EmTom: Actually you also have a weak group so black is not in trouble. In the next move comment you ask if defending the corner was better than making J17 stronger and that question is the best indication that your strategy was bad. You have two problems and only one move to cover them...]

Thanks in advance for the review!

EmTom: You had a lot of chances to attack your opponent in this game. Sometimes you did great other times you missed your chances. The most important things to remeber when you want to attack are: 

1) Not to touch your opponents stones while attacking them
2) Think about what can you gain while attacking

Also think about whether to take care for your group or attack your opponent. At the top there was good example for that. You should have had connected your groups and black would have been in a lot of trouble but you let black get stronger and you almost lost this game. 

Apart from those few mistakes you played a good game and it was fun to comment it.]
