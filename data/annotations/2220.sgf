C[Here's a game I lost by 1.5 points.  It was played between me (Xopods 22k* on IGS at the time of this game, although my rating seems to fluctuate between 18k* and 23k* depending on how many retarded mistakes I make) and nakaika 21k*.

The game basically came down to a fight that broke out in the lower left and swept all the way up the left side and into the top centre.  I think the fight could have ended up very well for me if I played properly, but I made some mistakes.  Still, the game was very close, and I could have won it in the endgame if I played better then.

Therefore, the main points I hope you can address in this review are regarding fighting and endgame, since I'm weak in those areas. (Well, at 22k*, I'm weak in just about every area, but I think I tend to lose most of my games in fights or the endgame).]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd]C[Been going for more territory-oriented openings these days, since they seem to give me a better result.  Usually 3-4 3-4 as B and 3-4 3-3 as W]
;W[qp];B[nq]C[Maybe I should have just made a shimari of my own instead of immediately getting in the way of his.

patrickb: Both are playable, though here I too would play that R15 or Q15 here, setting up a strong top side. Nothing realy wrong with this, I guess, though your choice of distance is a little odd. This far approach is used to discourage a w pincer, but lets w take more of the LR corner if he wants (by playing Q3). W can also tenuki here without much problem.]
;W[pn];B[kq];W[pj]C[Too slow by white, or is this good?  I would probably have approached at maybe Q 14, Q 15 or R 15 in white's position...

patrickb: There's not really anything wrong with it per se, except that it's not urgent. w is already very strong in the LR. An approach move to either 3-4 point strikes me as a better move. For example, a w approach at the top looks feasible, as it prevents b from making a good shimari there. It's also a little hard for b to pincer, since w is strong at the bottom right now.]

(;B[pg]C[Should I have played a shimari instead of playing this wide?

patrickb: It's an odd choice of move - it doesn't really secure the corner, it doesn't help threaten the invasion at Q8/R8 much, and it's a bit far from Q17. The shimari would be better, I think, but I'm not even convinced that the right side is where you want to be playing. If w approaches the upper right corner, his right side looks large but is actually a little thin. I might be tempted to play something like E16, or make a more conventional shimari. The real question is this - did you have a good reason/plan for making this long extension from Q17 instead of a more standard shimari? If so, then I can't complain; I just don't see the reason. :)]
;W[ed]
(;B[df]C[I figured that since he played for influence in the bottom right, I should try to counter.  Should I have played C 13 or D 17 instead?

No, this is fine. It aims at the left side more than the corner.The standard joseki to take the top left corner if that's what you want starts at E17. See the variation.]
;W[id];B[dn];W[fp];B[dj]C[The game looks fairly balanced at this point, yes?

patrickb: yes, I think so. You really want to get in a move near H3 now, BTW.]
;W[pe]C[Stupid me.  I just read on Sensei's Library how to deal with this, but didn't take the advice.  Should have sacrificed at R 15 in order to connect over and press him low, maybe?  Or maybe just something like O 13 immediately?

patrickb: This is actually not easy to deal with. Neither attachment is particularly pretty, though I guess the attachment underneath is most attractive of those. The aggressive attacking move at P14 seems interesting, too, hoping to build influence to counter-invade at Q8. Have to watch out for the life of the Q17 stone, then, though.]

(;B[qd]C[Probably not the best thing I could have done.

patrickb: probably not, no.];W[qe];B[ng]C[Is this an okay result?  As I said, I didn't follow the sequence I read on SL, but this doesn't look so bad to me.

patrickb: It's okay, I guess, though it doesn't do much besides run. W has a good move at P17 in reserve, too.]

(;W[od]C[patrickb: this helps you make the corner more secure. Whew.]
;B[oc];W[qg]
(;B[ph]C[patrickb: Why this instead of hane?];W[qh];B[pi];W[qi]
C[White gets territor, I have some influence.  The centre looks good for me.

patrickb: You let w connect easily and make a large right side. The center has possibilities, yes, but w has a *lot* of solid cash now.]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[nd]C[patrickb: and this hane isn't as forceful as w is connected.]
;W[ne];B[md];W[me]
(;B[kd]C[Ikken tobi the right move here, or should I have just hane'd?]
;W[ic]C[patrickb: well, the ikken tobi provoked this, which w wanted to play. Is the hane you get at M15 worth it? In a word, no.]
;B[fe]C[Might as well push him down and try to expand my influence over the centre.

patrickb: I'd get H3 in first if nothing else. You can always reduce this group at E17 if you need to.]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[fd];B[ge];W[gd];B[hp]C[This is where things start to get interesting.

patrickb: This is a good direction, though I'm not sure if H3 or H4 is more preferable...]
;W[fn];B[cp]C[Will he give me the corner?];W[cq]C[No.]
(;B[bp]C[patrickb: I would have pulled back to C5 instead. If he decends to B3, then cover the invasion point at D8 and leave the aji of E3 in place (though it'd be better if H4 was H3). If he protects some other way,]
;W[bq]
(;B[eo]TR[dp][fp][fn]C[So I decide to try to cut him up, since I look pretty strong all around and have some good influence.

patrickb: pushing through these shapes without a lot of help nearby can be pretty dangerous.]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[do];B[cn];W[co];B[bo];W[go];B[en];W[gp];B[gn]
C[And there's the cut that starts the whole bloody mess that ensues.  Could I have won this game by playing more conservatively?  I figured I had to do SOMETHING with my influence...  Maybe I should have just built a gigantic moyo...

patrickb: Well, you just weakend the bottom side, and the H4 stone looks really misplaced now. Can you get enough compensation?]
;W[hq]C[patrickb: which is worth more, this one stone or the ponnuki from taking at F7? answer: the ponnuki, because he can't even catch this stone cleanly!]

(;B[ho];W[fm];B[gm];W[iq]C[Should I have ignored this and captured the two stones in a ladder?]
;B[jo]C[This seemed like a reasonable response.];W[fl];B[gl]
;W[fk];B[hj]C[Taking your advice not to push from behind...]
;W[fi]C[patrickb: yes, but now it's time to come back and protect D8 :)]
;B[fj]C[Now, I think that it's possible to cut ikken tobi in a situation like this, just complicated, right?  I figured I was strong enough to do it, but was struck down by self-doubt in the middle of the sequence.  Was playing this move the mistake, or should I have stuck with it and not backed down?

patrickb: This is a mistake. Directly cutting one-point jumps is usually a mistake. Why not just make a big profit on the left side and keep attacking? He doesn't have a good place to run, and youre left side and middle are getting larger as he runs. What's hte problem? You're making territory while attaking. He escapes in gote, you play R2, and then the game looks pretty good for b.
.]
(;W[ej];B[gj]
(;W[dk]
(;B[di]C[Here's where I back down.  I could have played the atari at E11 and connected at D11, but suddenly started to worry about what would happen afterwards, and decided to write F 10 off as a mistake and try to cut my losses. Yes, but if there were problems before, they're still there when he plays C9.]

(;W[ei];B[ck];W[gi]C[patrickb: take the atari at D8 now if he's doing to give it to you!]
;B[ih];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm]
(;B[bm];W[dm];B[bj]C[Now my side is safe, but he has an eye and sente.  Not a great result.   patrickb: A very bad result in fact., but he doesn't have an eye if you throw in at E9...]
;W[dh]C[patrickb: but thisis the real problem.];B[ch];W[dg]
;B[cg];W[hh]
(;B[eg]C[F 13 or E 14better?  I guess this is what you said last time about atariing too early.

patrickb: yes, or the eye-stealing move at F13 might be the right move instead]
;W[eh];B[fg]C[Or maybe this is the mistake?  E 14 better?];W[cf]
;B[bf];W[ef];B[de];W[ee]C[Now I'm in trouble.  He's managed to cut off my four stones.]

(;B[gg]C[Not sure I could save them, but sure that I was in big trouble if I didn't, so I might as well try.

patrickb: But this is a little slow, and just asks him to play the H13 move he wants. Now it's a fight between your weak stones and his stronger ones. If you play H13 instead, at least you're both weak. :)]
;W[hg];B[he]C[He could block at J 15, and that would be that, wouldn't it?  Or would black H 16 have a chance of doing anything?  I would imagine that he'd win any semeai, right?]

(;W[ig]C[I guess he thought that there was still a danger to his big group.]
;B[ie]C[Again, he could block me (K 15), at the risk of making things complicated.  Maybe he didn't see it, or maybe he figured he was winning and he should just play defensively.]
;W[ii]C[But he doesn't.  I decide to save the stone, since if he hasn't blocked me yet, he probably isn't going to.]
;B[jh];W[hi];B[je]C[And now I'm alive.];W[jg];B[kh];W[kg];B[kj]
;W[lf]C[And now  he's alive and connected too.  Little I could do about that

What is the actual result of all this insanity?  I have trouble counting these situations.  I think he's winning, but it depends on what I can do with my centre.  I'd be a lot happier if I had a stone or two around O6 to O8, but I still felt the top right centre region was more urgent than tenuki.  Was it?]
;B[le]C[Might as well take this in sente.];W[mg]C[Or maybe not?  For some reason, I thought he'd connect solidly.  This might have been a thank-you move?  Now I still need to do something around there.

patrickb: yep, a thank-you move, though not *too* big of one.]
;B[nh]C[Bamboo joint looked natural.];W[mh]C[Good?  I might have tenukied in his position, exploit the opening on the right side of my middle almost-moyo before I can complete it.]
;B[mi]C[Should *I* have tenukied?  Or played a bit lower on the board, at M 10 or M 9?]
;W[gk];B[hk]C[Probably a mistake, right?  Bad cutting point at H8.

patrickb: yes];W[jj]C[But he gives me a chance to defend it.

patrckb: but now your center is gone.];B[il]C[Necessary, right?]
;W[kk];B[lj];W[jk];B[mk]C[Is this the right place, or should I have played lower and further right, e.g. O8 or O6?  All this time, I had my eye on Q2 (R2?  Or would that be overplay for me?  I would've gone for Q2), but he got there first.  Just couldn't seem to get sente. The game seemed to be quickly swinging in his favor at this point.]
;W[oq]C[And there goes my chance to play Q2.  Very good move by white, right?  Or would white playing Q2 himself be better?

W probably shouls have held back to Q3.];B[nr];W[or];B[jr];W[ir]
C[White makes these moves sente.  Was it correct to answer them, or should he be reducing around O6 or L7 now?]
;B[oo];W[op];B[np];W[po];B[ok];W[on];B[no];W[nn];B[ol];W[pl]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[nm]C[This sequence almost saved the game for me.  White lets me get a biggish centre.]
;W[om];B[nl];W[lm];B[ll];W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[jl]C[Proud of myself for reading that out and successfully killing the stones. Probably better ways I could have done it, though?  I let his other group push in a bit too much.

patrickb: Well, you got this much at least. W's right side is immense, though.]
;B[in]C[Neccessary.];W[im];B[hm]C[Quite amazing how this whole group barely holds together.]
;W[jn];B[ln];W[ko];B[jp];W[ip];B[io];W[jq];B[kp];W[kr]C[I don't think there was any way I could have stopped this without losing the whole group around G8 and above.]
;B[lr];W[js];B[hd];W[hc];B[db]C[Misread, here.  Thought it'd be sente.  Didn't see that him connecting at D16 put my group in atari.]
;W[dd];B[ce];W[eb];B[cb]C[Given how close the game turned out, I could probably have won with a better endgame.  I think that trying to cut his ikken tobi was the "losing" move, but there were plenty of places I could no doubt have squeezed a few points out of him in yose and turned it into a victory.

patrickb: you really want to get P1 in. It's quite large.];W[kb]
C[This, for instance, is painful.  If I'd played K18  (K18 is right, isn't it?  Or is L18 better?) instead of mistakenly playing D18 in gote, I probably would have won, right?]
;B[jc]C[Given that I let him play L18, sacrificing this stone to prevent further intrusion is a decent response?  Or could I have somehow given him less?]
;W[jb];B[lb];W[kc];B[lc];W[jd];B[rd]C[I guess I could have played S15, since he didn't have a stone at Q 16, so S 16 for him wouldn't have worked, right?  *sigh*  So many missed chances.  Or was this sequence better, since it turned out sente?]
;W[re];B[se];W[sf];B[sd];W[rg];B[os];W[ps];B[ns];W[qr]C[patrickb: At least you got these endgame points.]
;B[aq];W[ar];B[ap];W[br];B[nf];W[mf];B[lh];W[oe];B[kf];W[lg]
;B[bn]C[A bit of a desperation move.  I felt I was further behind than I was, so I was going to let myself play E8 safely... two points in gote if he correctly plays E9, a win if he mindlessly plays E7.  No such luck, so I probably could have done something better with sente.

patrickb: how about the sente move at E19?];W[pf];B[el];W[ek]

;B[dq]C[I was pretty such this wouldn't work, but I'm pretty bad at reading, and it wasn't going to cost me anything (since he certainly wouldn't tenuki or pass), so I decided to try.

patrickb: It's just a ladder. You should be able to read this out. It's unbranched.]

;W[lo];B[ml];W[lq];B[lp];W[pd];B[qc]C[I wasn't quite sure whether I needed to connect, but felt like it was better safe than sorry, not realizing that the game was going to come down to 1.5 points.]

patrickb: Nothing quite is blatant as in the past game, but just mainly a lack of strategic vision. Letting w connect his invasion in the upper right side so easily was excruciating, as was trying to cut that one-point jump, when you could have so easily attacked for profit.]
