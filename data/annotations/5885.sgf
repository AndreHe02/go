C[Bad reading cost me the game. My main problem in this game, as i see it (please feel free to comment!) is that it lacks sense of direction of play. I never felt like I had any grip on the game starting from the opening.

Mateo : Hey Rahtol, enjoy :)];B[qd];W[pq];B[dc];W[od];B[ld]

(;W[og]C[This might become a big mistake later, if we consider black answered correctly. Why is it a mistake ? see variation :)]
