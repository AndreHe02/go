C[Hello chucklee !

I'm Babibo, french 3k. I've been playing these game since a long time, and I think I have a good intuition of the game. But I keep making moves that do not work, by lack of calculation...
 
Your intuition in the beginning was quite OK. Your biggest mistake was to mess things up in the first fight, getting cut everywhere. 
I tried to add some variations to show you what I see. I hope that will help. 

My comments are noted with a '1.', a '2.', or '3'. This is because I looked at the game three times. 
- on the first look, I give you my general impression. I think these are the most interesting and most correct comments, since this will give you hints about my feeling of the game.
- On the second and third pass, I analyzed more closely the variations. Here, I might be wrong, so don't pay too much attention to them. However, I can see when I look at the variations you added that you miscalculated a lot, so I thought this would be good to show you some variations.

My advice : 
- keep playing as you feel it : this is the best way to enjoy this game. I recommend reading "Get Strong at the Opening", or "Opening theory made easy". You will then be more confident in your opening moves (you have a good intuition in the beginning, so it would be a pity to think you are weak in the opening because you lose against fighters !!! Confidence is very important)

- either go to www.goproblems.com regularly and try the "30 seconds by problems" feature (the french name is "contre la montre"). Try easy problems, and don't hesitate to solve, resolve, and reresolve the same problems (20 problems once a week will give you 2k)
- or buy a book of problems (any Bozulich is excellent. I highly recommend Get Strong at Invading)
- and don't forget to calculate a lot during your games so that all this work isn't useless.

- and last : why not try to change your game style ? Ttry to play territorially (san san, and 3rd line everywhere :) You'll learn how to invade big moyos. Right now you seem to have a bad judgement in invasions and value of moves. 

Good luck
Babibo

P.S : I might be a bit tough with you. Sorry if I hurt your ego :)]

;B[jp]C[1.usually black plays K3 instead of K4];W[lp]C[Is the extension in front of the shimari the right move, or are moves around R10/D10 bigger?

1.No, a move in front of a shimari is big, making a box-like shape. 2.Personnally, I would prefer M3, to deprive K4 of a base. However, don't expect too much of an attack on a stone on the 4th line, theses stones are very flexible. 
C10, H3, and R10/Q10 are also very big.];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr]C[2. Usually, black simply plays F5, in case he prefers to play C3 instead of D2.]
;W[cq];B[fo]C[1.black plays solidly];W[qf]C[1.I would have chosen C10 or C14. I don't like to have weak groups. 2.But your move is OK.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rg]C[2. This joseki looks correct for both]
;B[qc]C[S16 is very big. You must answer (the life of your stones, of black's stones, and many points are at stake). If you didn't intend to play S16, you should have played R15 instead of R16.]
;W[pk]C[1.this looks overconcentrated
2. I would have played S16. In case of an invasion, you want your upper group to be solid.]
;B[og];W[ph];B[dj]LB[jb:E][cc:B][fc:D][cf:C][fm:A]C[Is san-san at C17 the right timing now, as it ends in sente (see variation)
1.Since K16 and D10 are both on the 4th line, it is usually not a good idea to invade at san san. I would invade at C14 to weaken D10, or F17 simply to reduce the moyo. 
2.The san-san may be playable (but I wouldn't play it), but you will need to find a very good invasion move .
3. I added C, D, and E variations. I think C is the best. E is a handicap overplay.
I added san san variations. These variations show that the result can be very bad for you, and that san-san variation can be gote.]

(;W[fm]LB[ni:A]C[1.I don't like the shape very much here. Moreover, I think it is a slack move, since F5 is not attackable at the present. Now black can reinforce his moyo with D14. 
3. A would look better if the question was to reduce black's moyo (since it also enlarges your own), but since black's moyo is bigger, it is better to invade.]

(;B[ec];W[dg]LB[ce:A][fj:B][dl:C]C[Is this severe enough? Is D12 perhaps better?

Dunno :). It looks OK, but the sequence you played next was clearly favorable for black.]
;B[df]C[This black is a mistake. (don't attach to weak stones)]
;W[eg]C[Good.];B[ef]LB[ff:A][fg:B]
(;W[ff]C[Hane at the head of two stones...does not seem to be the right move here.
1.Yes ! Doesn't look very good :),

2.But there still are ways to use this cutting stones (see the many variations I added)]
;B[fg]
(;W[fh]C[Don't forget that the atari is not the only move.]
;B[gg]LB[eh:B][gh:A][ei:C]C[I added C]
(;W[gh]C[Would the variation at E12 be better?

I think so.];B[eh];W[hg];B[gf];W[hf];B[ge]LB[kf:A][hh:B][ei:C]
C[Connect at H12 now? The option I chose, L12, was intended to severely reduce black, and possibly even cut off the top right group. However, the cut at H12 ends very badly for white.

2. Yes. The cut at B should be repaired very soon. However, E11 by black would be extremely big, so I would do something here first. (see variation C)]

(;W[kf]C[This is an overplay. You'll get cut everywhere and then the stones you placed in the beginning have no meaning.]
;B[hh]
(;W[ih]C[2.The atari leads nowhere. It removes the aji, and gives you bad shape.]
;B[hi]LB[ei:B][gj:A]
(;W[gj]LB[gi:A]C[This is also possibly a mistake? Perhaps the variation would be better?

1.Looks like black missed a sequence ! (see variation A)

3. You try to save everything. This can't be good.]
(;B[ei]C[Black has now secured a massive territory, and after the successful invasion on the bottom right by black, black wins by 20 or so points.]
;W[fj];B[hj];W[kd];B[je];W[ke];B[hk];W[gl];B[hl]LB[jc:A]C[1. Here I would not follow black's plans. K17 looks bigger]

(;W[hm];B[im];W[hn];B[in];W[ho];B[hq]C[I thought black might consider using the wall to separate the white stones. On the other hand, securing the base is perhaps the most sensible strategy.]
;W[ni];B[rd]C[A good move, largely securing 2 eyes on top right for black]
;W[li]C[White stones now connected for sure

More than connected, in my opinion :) I would try to get a base around K17 first and then connect if I don't have 2 eyes.]
;B[ig]LB[if:B][jg:A]
(;W[jg]C[Again, seems to be the wrong direction?

1. Well again, I'd say : Atari is not the only move. Maybe you prefer to play K17
