[jp];B[dd];W[pc];B[pe]C[kkkken: I felt w should pincer here, try to use q3-k4 extensioon]
;W[nd]C[ TT: A pincer is of course good, but you can't say that this move is bad.]
;B[qc];W[pd]L[qb]C[ TT: a) is more natural here. A move like this is normally considered   vulgar (cf. the proverb "Hane at the head of two stones.").]
;B[qd];W[oe];B[pf]C[
 kkkken 7k*: should w sacrifice r15 first?

 TT: The sacrifice would make black too thick. The forcing moves in the corner
 are not that important.];W[dj]L[nc][kc][pi]C[ TT: Too early to tenuki. White has a serious defect at a). Probably   he should play b) expecting black c). (See variation.)]

(;B[jc]M[nd][oe][pd][pc]L[ic][lc][fc][gc]C[
 kkkken 7k*: i think w should p14 then f17
 kkkken 7k*: (not d10)

kkkken: now I feel k17 too close to thickness.  If I played "a"
        I could extend to "b".  Maybe "c" or "d" is better?  But
        I felt if I did that, I'd give white a nice extension to a.

 TT: As the marked stones are actually quite weak this is the right general   direction, but it fails to quite hit the key point (it gives white the   chance to protect at b). Generally since all blacks positions are solid
 he should think in terms of attack rather than defence. Particularly on   the right side where white is outnumbered black would welcome a fight.]
;W[gd]C[ TT: This is clearly an overplay. White has now three weak groups - very
 dangerous.];B[je]C[
 kkkken 7k*: o13 seems like the key point here

 TT: This move is natural. If black plays anywhere else white will cap   here and things will get confused. This fight is likely to favour black
 so he has no reason to take any chances.];W[cf]M[gd]L[df][ng]C[ TT: Right direction. I would play a) since the marked stone is so
 weak. It is correct that b) is also a key point here, but white
 can't expect to have time for everything.];B[ee]L[df]C[
 kkkken 7k*: g14 seems only move

 TT: a) is very strong here. You don't have to be a beginner to play   tsuke-nobi!]
;W[cd]C[kkkken: I was surprised when w didn't g14.  w feels overconcentrated
        on the edge ?

 TT: Yes white is playing from the strong side.];B[cc]C[
 kkkken 7k*: i think w should have saved 3-3 invasion
 kkkken 7k*: c14 stone already backed up by d10];W[ce]L[bc]C[ TT: The double-hane at a) or the cross-cut is the usual idea   behind the attachment against the 4-4 stone.]
;B[ec]L[bc][ff]C[ TT: Too weak against the hane at a). The solid connection is better.
 Probably even better is b), but this might make your opponent think
 you are playing rengo!];W[gf]L[eg][ng]M[ec]C[kkkken: Now the marked stone feels slow to me.  what should I have
        done?  but I have the nice points "a" and "b" to choose from..]
;B[ng]L[eg]C[ TT: Very good point. The alternative is, as you say, a).]
;W[of]C[
 kkkken 7k*: b has many nice points now (g18, e13, etc];B[og];W[pg]C[ TT: Overplay. White should move out with his main group, or seek life.]
;B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi]M[jc][je]C[kkkken: I feel the cut was too much, given the presense of my          marked stones to help my cutting stones.]

didn't work.  Given that, should I have played "a" or "b" ?

 correct shape when there is this keima relationship between two stones   (marked).]

 kkkken 7k*: wow, can g16 really live?];W[jf]L[hj]C[ TT: Bad, this stone is not important. White's best bet is probably a)
 although he is in severe difficulties here.];B[ie];W[ke]C[ TT: Better to keep this move in reserve until white can cut.]
;B[kd];W[ig];B[md]L[ih][hb]M[ke][jf][kf]C[kkkken: this move is no good.  but more broadly,
should I take the time to connect?  I feel in this game
I played a little bit too slow, never got W weak enough

 TT: Black is miles ahead here, so a "safety first" move cannot be   critisised. A better way of playing would be a). If white protects
 the marked stones black can play b). I guess the morale is: If you   plan to make a small gote move, look for forcing moves first.]

 kkkken 7k*: c7 shameless territory move

kkkken: c7 seems pretty slow now.  what's my best bet here?

 TT: Even if the single white stone CAN live, the lower side seems bigger.
 Probably invading at something like a) is best, in view of the influence   provided by the marked stones. If black plays like this, white has no real
 territory anywhere.];W[cg];B[dh];W[ef]C[ TT: It is very difficult to see how the white group on the right can   live, but this certainly doesn't help.]

C[
kkkken: was it worth playing this move?  the goal was to keep w weak,
but maybe it's too slow.

 TT: Since black can probably kill the white group it seems worthwhile to
 play here.];W[gg]C[
 kkkken 7k*: i think if w lives, it's gote];B[mp]L[ni][nm]C[
 kkkken 7k*: whee
 kkkken 7k*: i should be more careful, g8-j9-l10 thin

 TT: No this is fine. The lower right corner is thin, and black also has   various moves around a) and b). White took gote on the upper side, but   he's still not alive!]
;W[gp];B[gr]M[mp]L[po]C[
 kkkken 7k*: w plays so high in the face of thickness

 TT: More natural to play from the weak side - from the marked stone -
 a) for example.];W[cp]M[om][pq][jp]C[
 kkkken 7k*: has entering byo-yomi again

kkkken: I was very surprised to see b jump in here.
I thought with that thickness the whole center would
be mine!  but it was by luck that I actually ended up
with it.  Where did I go wrong?

 TT: White should attack the single black stone to the right, since it is   is out-gunned by the marked stones. THEN he might try something in the
 lower left corner.];B[dp];W[cq]C[
 kkkken 7k*: i can't believe it];B[cr]L[dr]C[ TT: How about just a) here?]

and then I did a terrible job of killing (Failing to kill).
advice please!

 TT: White has to live here in order to make a game of it of course.
 At this point black shouldn't try to kill white - just wrap the game
 up as safely as possible.];B[cn];W[bo];B[el]L[em][fl][hn][fo]
[hp][hq][jn]M[cn][bo]C[
kkkken: now this move (e8) seems wrong to me.  perhaps h6?
        it seems I have little to fear from w connecting these weak
        stones, none of which seem to have much eye potential.

 TT: The basic strategy behind this move is good, since black is ahead
 he should think safety first. Strictly speaking if black wants to play
 this way it is better to omit the exchange of the marked stones and just   play a) - that would leave the ko in the corner for later. The problem is   now that white can't actually connect the two stones. Black will cut
 through the keima at a), and he can answer both the kosumi a) and the

 attachment b) with  the played move. If black wants to attack c) looks best:
 it threatens d) or e). Alternatives to this are f) and g).];W[bh];B[bi]
;W[bg]L[bj]C[ TT: The descent at b12 would have been sente for black, and white now   threatens a clamp at a) so this is not too bad.]
;B[ci];W[hq]M[bh]C[
kkkken: given that w ends up basically living, maybe i shouldn't
have answered the marked move?

 TT: Correct. The clamp is only worth something like 14 points in   gote. Furthermore, the surrounding black positions are perfectly
 safe.];B[fr];W[im];B[jn];W[hk]C[kkkken: this move (h9) was played as a ko threat, because w was
        very low on time];B[hl];W[il];B[jk];W[in];B[jo];W[io];B[gn]L[kp]
C[ TT: a) seems more reasonable.];W[kp];B[ln];W[km];B[lo];W[ll]L[kl]
[kk]C[ TT: a) might be better since it makes b) forcing. This is all a bit   hairy for black. The group on the upper side hasn't got two eyes yet.]
;B[kl];W[lm]L[jm][lk]C[ TT: a) looks better (if black cuts then b) is forcing).]
;B[jm];W[jl];B[kk];W[kr];B[ir];W[hr]L[ml]C[ TT: Better to turn at a) and stake the game on the semeai. Even   if white lives at the bottom he is way behind. Assuming that black   emerges with sente to play in the lower right corner it is difficult   to count more than 45 points for white (including komi) whereas   black has at least 50.]

great shape.];W[jr];B[iq];W[ip];B[nk];W[li];B[ki];W[jq]L[ks][nr]C[ TT: a) followed by watari at b) is better for white here.]
;B[is];W[js];B[gs];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr];B[oq];W[ml]L[pl]C[ TT: This and the subsequent moves not only lose points for white, but   also make the cut at a) possible.]
;B[nl];W[nm];B[mn];W[mk];B[nj];W[ni];B[mj]C[kkkken: now w must add a stone to lower group.  this mistake lost the
game.  But I would rather not have counted on w's mistake!];W[ol]C[ TT: Better to try to make some points in the corner.]

        white groups --- w defended upper (which I could kill in

 is ahead anyway.]
