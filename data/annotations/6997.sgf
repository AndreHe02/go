C[This game is the second game of the Scottish final(which i lost).
Black (Poitre wisthal)
white (Robbie Miller)
If you could give me a general review of the game highlighting problem areas.
I also have some questions i would specifically like answered, scattered through the game.

Thank you very much in advance.

;B[qo]C[I felt that here i should have maybe been able to take an advantage from his deviation from joseki.]

(;W[jd]C[I tend to suffer in the opening, is this the biggest point?

I would prefer to make shimari(C14) to make sure black can not use his wall very well but this isn't bad as well.
About not finishing joseki, see variation.];B[ce];W[ed];B[dj]

(;W[df]LB[nc:A]C[This seems to give away to much, black was very weak in this area and this way you just give him all points for not really nice wall.  I would prefer to play O17 insteed.]

(;B[cg];W[cf];B[bf]C[This situation in the top right didn't end well for me. maybe i should have just gone for a solid wall?]

(;W[oo]C[I think this move really let me down, I was afraid that if i went for a territory grabbing move black framework on the right would have become massive.

I don't think so, it should be easy to reduce the side especially with bit weakness at Q14, which  you could use even now.]

;B[oj];W[pj];B[gn];W[ne];B[od];W[gm]C[This is quite good idea, capturing this group,although it may be hard would allow white to get a lot of points.
Black could have probably won the game by simply extending in L3 area insteed.]

Yea, this hurt a lot, G5 was the only move.]

;W[ji];B[ih];W[ii];B[hg];W[gi];B[oa]C[here i finally saw that black could make an eye :(

Yea, you lost move at L18, you should have removed that eye insteed. After that the game was over.

Concluding you played fighting game but quite fast got behind. There were atleast 2 quite easy mystakes in reading which If avoided can allow you to win games(Q9 and L18). You should also avoid giving away easy points to opponent. Like you did at D14.]
