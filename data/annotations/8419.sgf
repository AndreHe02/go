C[X: Hello, my name is Steve, on KGS "Xue". So I will start my comments with "X:"

The two general recommendations I think you should focus on are:

-Pay attention to direction of play, particularly "divide and conqure". Try to choose sequences depending on the outcome: does this exchange help my opponent or me, does it make these other stones stronger or weaker? Order of moves is very important!
-Whenever you want to defend a group, see if you can defend by attacking/expanding. If your opponent threatens a cut that could kill a group, but the cut itself only cuts off 1 stone, see if you can play an extension move that will save the group despite the cut, or an attacking move that makes the cut superfluous, etc.]

(;W[ck]C[should i have kept up the attack on the F3 group? how would i have done so if that's the case? i thought that my D4 stone was too weak to put much pressure on the F3 group

X: Yes, I agree to keep attacking.];B[if]C[X: This seems very odd from black....like a misclick or something....???]
(;W[pf]LB[cf:D][ek:A][fo:C][eq:B]TR[ci][fq][hq]C[trying to disrupt potentially large black moyo

X: Remember the proverb (don't follow proverbs blindly, but they are sometimes good reminders!) "First, see if you have weaknesses, if you do, defend. Then see if your opponent has weaknesses, if he does, attack. Then take big moves."

Here your left corners are not settled, but not really weak.
Black has a weak group at the bottom, and a lone stone on the left. With both you can attack while strengthening your groups!! Black's moyo is not yet so big that you can't invade later.

Moves A to D would all strengthen white's unsettled groups while attacking black's weak groups. (C is, imho, not a good option here, since white doesn't have a lot of potential in the center).]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[cq]
(;W[dq]C[i thought blocking from this side would give me more central influence. thoughts?

X: This is the correct side to block, because otherwise black would be connecting to form a very solid group. This way black has 2 weak groups, one of which will almost certainly die. As for central influence, black is already very present in the center, so I don't se that much potential to use central influence. In this case I think going for territory is preferable to influence.]
;B[ic];W[ce]LB[jj:D][qj:A][ek:C][cp:B]C[X: Gah, no. Here white is forcing black to become stronger and to connect this uncertain left group to his other stones, creating a strong center. If you're worried about the corner, don't play contact, rather B16 or something. I would prefer to jump out with a keima at E14, or tenuki. White's corner gropu will be small but not die. A to D all seem like bigger moves to me, I think A the best. B is probably not so good: it is very big, taking the corner, and helps the stone at C9, but to be effective, really needs C. So perhaps first playing C and then B would be better.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[de];W[cd];B[dr];W[cp]SQ[fq][hq]C[X: I would perfer not to let black connect the stones. All of a sudden the two marked stones are very solid.]
;B[dk];W[dl];B[el]
(;W[dm]C[this move was too slow, right? see variations. i think i  was trying to hold onto too much territory on the left while sacrificing the opportunity to attack black's lower group.

X: I think this move is ok, it is solid. Black defends, and then white has sente, so it's ok. If white wants to fight, then fight comletely.]
;B[dj];W[qj];B[in];W[jj]LB[df:C][io:B][cr:A]SQ[pf][qj]C[the right timing? i didn't want black's central moyo to get too out of control, so i plopped this guy down at what looked like the right spot.

X: Black's moyo isn't that big. Where does he have moyo? With the marked group, the actual moyo is already very limited, so I think it would be better to attack or defend. A to C imho are more important moves, I think B is the best, white can continue to pressure the lower group, which isn't completely settled yet (at least, not if white can eventually keep sente and cut at A).]
;B[jn]SQ[jo][np][jq]C[X: Now the marked stones are no longer so strong.]
;W[ko]C[I would still play the other way and try to cut. Put pressure on black!]
;B[kn]
(;W[mo]LB[pq:A]C[X: White is getting overconcentrated while black makes influence for the center. Now white's tengen stone is getting very lonely and weak. Playing at A instead, white extends, attacks (slightly) black, and still cannot be cut. Thicker and less overconcentrated.]
;B[ln];W[nj]C[X: Good. Those two stones need to be reinforced, and the central stone needs to be connected. Right direction.]

X: Yes, black gets a lot of thickness. The cutting stones isn't very worrisome, because the left group is quite stable already, and the two marked stones can threaten to connect with the lower stones. White's cutting stone can only run to the center, which has more black influence than white, meaning it woud have to kill to live (or make all it's walls, very hard to do profitably).]

(;W[ek]C[X: A is the move that, in my opinon, makes the nicest shape for white, however...]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[fi]SQ[if]C[X: it also forces black to play in a way that uses the square-stone in a nice way. The square stone is horrible play for black, let's not help him correct his mistake! ^__^]
)
(;W[eq];B[go]C[X:];W[dm]LB[cf:A]C[X: Up to here this seems like a pretty nice exchange (white's answers are the same or similar also if black plays a simple extension or one-space jump). Black quite certainly still needs to defend his heavy three stones, leaving white sente to play A, so this seems ideal. I would play this.

X: However, if I were black, after the kosumi, I might just decide to sacrifice the two stones completely and play A myself.]
)
(;W[cf];B[ei];W[ek];B[ef];W[fd]TR[ck][ek][dp]C[X: Now white's triangled group is somewhat weak. Black's upper group is also not settled but quite light. Black can easily sacrifice a stone or two to make a pretty big central wall.]
))
(;W[eq]C[X: Even a simple kosumi is good here. Usually kosumi-attach is a bad exchange, but in this case it makes black over-concentrated with influence it cannot really use, so good for white. So perhaps black answers with a one-space jump instead, or keima at G5. Keima is the most solid, but makes the stones quite heavy. one-space jump leaves quite some weakness I think.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[hn];W[dj]C[X: Or D9 would also be a nice follow-up I think. D9 settles the corner more nicely, and lets you focus more on developing the upper corner afterwards, so perhaps preferable. I tend to go for influence-focused play, which is why I like the shoulder-hit ^__^.]
