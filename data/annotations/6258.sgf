C[enka369: Hi!];B[qo]C[Allar: Hi

TedErnst: Pros make this move.  Players at our level rarely do.  I like to see beginners make this move, to get the experience of what happens.  We don't know enough yet for joseki to help us much anyway, so go for it!]
;W[pp]C[TedErnst: And white attempts to punish right away.]
;B[ql]C[TedErnst: I like this extension, using the opening as a play for the side, avoiding an early fight.]
;W[qp];B[no]C[TedErnst: The proverb says, "Corners, then sides, then center."  Black's first two moves are a play for the side.  This move doesn't do much for black.  Better would be R16 (play for the whole side) or Q5 (don't give white any more ground)]
;W[po];B[pn]C[TedErnst: Black's shape was seriously hurt by the O5 move.  R6 is the only option here to try to save it.  Q6 is just asking for the cross-cut.]
;W[qn];B[oo]C[TedErnst: Interesting instinct.  Not sure what it does for black.  Q7 better?  Or even the obivous S5?]
;W[on];B[pm];W[ro];B[oq];W[nn];B[nm]C[TedErnst: Corners, then sides, then center.  This would be a good time to play elsewhere, like R11, L4 or in either top-right or bottom-left corners]

;W[qm];B[sm];W[om];B[pl];W[nl];B[lm]C[TedErnst: I like black's aggressiveness to trap the white group.  And then this move comes.  Hmm.  Useless.  Corners, then sides, then center.  Notice a theme to my comments?  R12 would be a good 2-space extension.  R16 is even better, making a corner play.  The single black stones are all useless, so leave them alone and play elsewhere.]

;B[ds];W[cs];B[hr];W[es];B[dr];W[ep]C[TedErnst: the overall reason for this black disaster is playing too close to white - after mistakes, or even when things are more stable, it's a good idea to play elsewhere - create something strong somewhere else instead of continuing to fight losing battles, or to fight where the battle is already won]
;B[oj]C[TedErnst: too far towards the center.  Q11  would be great or  , or R16]
;W[pi];B[ph]C[TedErnst: R11 is still a good black move, actually]
;W[oi];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk]C[TedErnst: this is passive - R14 or even R16 better - white gains only one point by playing R9, so leave it alone]
;W[ok]C[TedErnst: white is following the black strategy of playing moves that are way too small.  This would be a great time for white to play R16]

TedErnst: Black's game is much better than 30k.  If you were to ask me for one comment on the game, I'd say "Corners, then sides, then center."

You actually did quite well bottom-right, but gave up the whole bottom-side without gain in return

> and in the endgame when I lost

S14 was your key poor move here.  R17 would've made a huge difference.

The invasion was too little, too late.  Much better to get a foothold there earlier.

Let me know if you have more questions.])
