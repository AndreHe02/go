C[Hello Mr. Hirsch. Remember, only a high ranking pro knows the
truth about go. Please accept all my amateur comments with polite
suspicion. Their value is only how they may stimulate your own
thinking about your game.

To view this record so it makes sense with the comments, please
set your viewer to SGF style, that is, such that it shows the
next move as the letter "a". If you see a letter "a" at Q4, the
first move in this game, then your viewer is set correctly.

Enjoy.

November 9, 2000];B[pp];W[dp];B[pc]C[White a is unusual. Does White have a special plan? We shall
see.];W[ce]C[By playing the high Chinese opening with a, Black's strategy
is aiming to build a moyo and attack White when White comes in
on the right, so as to enlarge his moyo sufficiently to ensure
a win. Selecting a instead of R11 means Black intends to emphasize
thickness.];B[pi]TR[ce]C[White a is out of blance with the marked stone. Consequently,
White should not play this way.];W[jc]C[b is the instant move for Black to demonstrate how K17 is out
of balance. (CONCEPT: It then becomes difficult to make K17 a
usefully placed stone.)]
(;B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]C[White a is a slow gote move at this stage. In terms of value,
b is at least the same as a and it also "fixes" K17 by making
it a nice five-line extension off the corner enclosure.]
(;W[er]TR[pi]C[Black a is deficient in a similar way that white E2 is deficient.
Since Black is emphasizeing thickness, choosing the fourth line
is consistent, so playing at b could be better.]
(;B[mc];W[gc]C[Strangely, a is less valuable than it was before because white
has played G17. White does not have an efficient arrangement
on the top left.   Nevertheless, a is not so bad either. CONCEPT: when the opponent
is constructing something, come in at the last moment possible
to spoil it.   However, coming into a looks more like an invasion that is a bit too early. So...

Perhaps consider b. CONCEPT: seek a move which creates two
adjacent large zones. This could mean you may more easily turn
one of them into territory.]
(;B[dc];W[ed]C[Please remember, in general only push if you can cut. A just
helps White get stronger. Maybe play b, etc.]
(;B[dd];W[de];B[cd];W[be];B[bd];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]C[Connecting at a makes the carpenter's square shape with one leg.
Someone once said that anyone who completely understands the
carpenter's square is at least a 6-Dan.];B[db]C[White attacks the corner! If anything will work, b18 must indeed
be the vital point. But this shape is too strong to die.];W[bb]
TR[eb]C[Hmm. Running into white from the legless side is wrong. If Black
plays at b, the best White can do is seki. See variation.]
(;B[bc]C[White might continue with a play at b. See variation.]

(;W[ad]C[If Black plays at b he looks easily alive.]
(;B[ac]C[White a is slack. White has to take the eye point at b.]

(;W[ae];B[cb];W[dj]C[Black a is a bit slow, but lets see what develops. Black b makes
an imposing boxy shape daring White to invade the 3-3.]
(;B[qq]C[White a is slow.];W[fr]TR[fq]C[An attempt at judgement:

First, an overview... In the Go game there are only two types
of moves, urgent moves or large moves. An urgent move means you
must help your stone or group become settled or comfortable (or
punish your opponent's stone or group that is not settled or
uncomfortable). You can see if something is uncomfortable by
imagining enemy stones coming close to it with effect. If no
urgent move is required, then take the largest move. (Go is so
simple, eh?)

So let's see. Is the F3 stone uncomfortable? Of course it is.
It has a liberty and a connection problem. BUT ! ... (there is
always a but)

Is F3 an important stone? We can tell this way. If a stone secures
something, connects something, or cuts the enemy, it is important.
So it seems like F3 is now unimportant, since it does not accomplish
any of those things. If the stone is unimportant, then helping
it can not be urgent...   Perhaps Black needs to tenuki (play elsewhere) and take the largest
move. Consider that a play at b both enlarges the black zone
and reduces the white zone (has double purpose).]

;B[mn];W[nn];B[oo];W[lo]TR[mn]C[Recall the previous comments about an important stone (and therefore
an urgent situation). The marked stone is important because it
cuts off O6 and helps significantly enlarge the right side. It
is therefore urgent to help that stone, such as with a play at b. Capturing
at a punishes white a bit (white has connection problems) but
it is not nearly as valuble as b.]
(;B[nq];W[mp];B[or]C[With a, white settles his invading group happily reducing the
black potential.];W[mm];B[on];W[ln];B[ol]TR[hr][gq][fq][jq]
[jp]C[Now that the white group in the lower right is strong, it is
time to see the urgency in somehow taking advantage of the marked
black group, that seems to have a base problem. The benefit of
attacking the weak black group is greatly enlarging the white
moyo. It is not inconceivable that black can die.];W[pj]C[Extening at b is correct to make things hard as possible for
the invading white stone.   CONCEPT: When the opponent attaches to your single stone with
a single stone (this happens so often in go), usually extend
when you are stronger in the area, or hane when weaker in the
area. On the right side, black is stronger in the area than white
is. Extending gives the opponent less opportunity for flexible
play, hence harder to defend himself when outnumbered. Try to
extend or hane in the more important (or more valuable) direction.
(If it is a group contacting a group, do the opposite. Hane when
stronger, extend when weaker.)]
(;B[oj];W[qi]C[Black at a is questionable because

it forces White to connect (hence strengthen himself) and
it comes from the less valuable direction.

Double hane at b seems a severe continuation now.]
(;B[pk];W[qj];B[ph]C[It seems pretty certain that white will now lay waste to the
right side. This is an unwarrented success for white.];W[qh]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[qk];W[qf];B[pg]C[White should secure life straight away with b.]

;W[rd];B[rc];W[qe];B[pd];W[sf];B[pe]C[White can solidify territory by attacking the weak black stones
and secure a win.]
(;W[je]C[Black may consider a probe (between the two white zones) at b.
If black cannot somehow deal with the left, much like white succeeded
in invading the right, then black is finished.   (commentary ends here)]
