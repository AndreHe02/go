(;W[oe]LB[qd:C][oe:A][nf:B]C[I think this may have been the wrong cut. Is r16 any better for white here?

prana: Right. r16 is better.
There exists kind of proverb for situations like this:
if you have 2 different ways to give atari (A and B), don't give the atari unless you are  sure which one of the ataris is the correct one.

Here, C works well, because it cuts black into 2 weak groups, which looks very promising.]

prana: Lets count:
 white 9p + 14p + 3 prisoners= 26p

black 16p + 6p = 25p

So, real territory is similar.

Black has nice thickness, and a potential moyo at A, which might be 20-25p worth. But he has also a weak group at B.

Summing that up, I agree black has a clear advantage (around 10p I would guess).]

prana: no,now it is too late.];B[gc];W[bc];B[nq]C[Is invading the corner with r3 still possible in this position? Should I have invaded with r3 sooner?

prana: Difficult. Invasion might be possible, but it is much harder now, you should have invaded earlier. It would have been probably sente because black wants to defend his moyo.]
