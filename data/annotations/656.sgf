;B[qq];W[cp];B[pe];W[dd];B[je]LB[oc:a][pc:b]C[Curious move.  A more standard move would be at a or b to make a corner enclosure and prepare for an extension in the vicinity of K16.  The two black stones have so little influence on the upper side that it would be a good  time for white to establish a position there.  The move at b is still available, for instance.]
;W[fc]C[This is rather conservative given the loose position that black has made.  It gives black an opportunity to respond in a way that is good for him.  The key to advancing in Go is to pay close attention to sente.  Your moves must be compelling, forcing your opponent to play in such a way that you have gained an advantage.  One way to think of it is that the first move in an area is always more valuable than the response.  If your opponent responds to each of your moves, you should win easily.  Likewise, if you always respond, you will lose.  Think of Go as a battle of wills, and always aim to make compelling moves.  When considering your opponent's move always ask yourself "do I have to respond?"]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[ic];W[pp];B[rq]C[B11 is not a good move.  By playing the 3-3 point in the first place, black has made clear his intention to take the corner, but he should look to expand to one side or the other, extending his influence.  B11 shows black willing to live small in the corner, which allows white the advantage in extending influence from the 4-4 point.]
;W[np];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr];B[ps]C[This sequence is very satisfying for white.  Black has a tiny corner territory and white has good shape from which he can extend from either side.]
;W[eq]C[This is a solid, reasonable move.];B[cj];W[cl];B[ek]
;W[jq]C[Playing w22 in this area is important now to try  to link the two white groups, though it might be better to play at J3 or K4.]
;B[hp];W[hq];B[gq];W[iq];B[gp];W[qj]C[At this point in the game, consider the relative positions of black and white.  White has two fairly secure corners on the left side and a group on the lower side that is safe with the potential for expansion.  White can be pretty confident of getting 50 points out of these positions, particularly with another move in the upper left.  Black has seven sure points in the lower right, but has only potential elsewhere.  The upper right corner is a huge framework, but isn't territory by any means.  So white needs to invade the upper right corner and make moves that expand his territory while limiting black's.  Rather than W28, which has virtually no connection with the white stones below, and is liable to be cut off or attacked from the top, helping black secure territory, I would consider invading the upper corner immediately, or trying to separate the black group at G4 from the stones above.]
;B[pn];W[qm]C[w30 allows black to link up with his corner group.  White should aim to prevent this with R5.  The white stone at R10 is not yet under attack, so there is no rush to establish a base for it, and black would be left with yet another unconnected group vulnerable to harrassment.  Since blacked played narrowly in the corner, white should try to completely seal the group off from the rest of the board.]
;B[qn];W[pm];B[om];W[oj];B[nk];W[mi]C[White definitely wants to get into the center here, so this is a good move, though I might have cut at P6 to set up attacking possibilities.  Separating your opponent's stones is  critical in go, and though beginners are generally wise to avoid complicated situations, it is often best tactically, as well as for learning, to cut when you can cut.]
;B[nn]C[Now it is particularly urgent for black to remove the cutting threat.]
;W[qg]C[Better to invade the corner now or continue out into the center.]
;B[qf];W[pg];B[of];W[ng];B[nf];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[pd];W[qc]
;B[nb];W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[qb];W[rb];B[rc];W[kb]
;B[ib];W[lc]C[That was successful for white, black's only hope is now in the center.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[cc]C[w66 is a very submissive move.  It is the turning point in this part of the game.  White should make every effort to push into black's potential territory.  White can give up the two white stones and still be safe in the corner.  Always be willing to sacrifice stones that will not affect the outcome of the game.]
;B[ee];W[mf]C[w68 does not help white and does not hurt black.]
;B[kh]C[Ouch, that was a critical point.];W[ki];B[ji];W[kj]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[jk];W[jl];B[il];W[jm];B[im];W[jo];B[in]C[This was a brutal sequence for white.  A useful proverb in go is "don't build your opponent's wall for him."  This is precisely what white did here.  Black got just what he needed, and what did white get?  Dame points.  This could have been avoided by even a cursory estimate of the points on the board.  Counting and reading sequences of potential plays are the drudgework of the game, but they can give you a huge advantage.  My teacher once described a series of simultaneous games she played against some amateurs.  Her attitude was, "How can they have any hope when I count  6 times a game and they don't know what the score is?"  It is hard, especially under time pressure, but try just once, only one game, to count once in the middle game and once just before the endgame starts and see how this affects your play.  Good luck!]
