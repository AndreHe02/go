AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer:  I am playing white.  This is one of the relatively rare games on the net where I give handicap stones - only two stones, but I feel awkward when I do.  I divide all my lost games into two categories;  "I lost a big group" and "other."  My feeling is that middle game issues like direction of play are my biggest problem, so I would appreciate some helpful comments/criticisms on the middle game.  Thanks for taking time to look at this game.

df: you made a slow move in the opening, then missed some chances to limit the center territory.  Once he completed his huge center, he was way ahead.  You played well in the endgame, but couldn't come back enough.]
;W[dd]C[Ota2ke [6k?\]: hi];B[ij];W[pp];B[kj]C[df: this is an unusual opening for black.  His plan will be to make thickness and a big center, so you will need to plan to counter that.  Since one stone in the center is very similar to two, he has given up almost a stone already,]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[rd];B[qh];W[qc]C[P14 or somewhere around R10 maybe better?

df: I like this.  he will give you the corners, so as long as you don't give him too much in the center you should win.]
;B[qk]
(;W[qm]C[df: I don't like this move.  The left side or bottom are bigger. Since he has stones in the center, he won't answer this move, since you can't attack his two stone extension,]
;B[jp]C[df: big move for black.];W[cn];B[dj]C[df: good move, making a big box.]

(;W[en]C[df: I don't like running out like this. You give him territory on the lower side, and sente. 

You could take the corner now, get ahead on territory, and reduce the ceter later, or you could approach from the other side.]
;B[fp];W[gn]C[df: This move is worse than the last one.  Running out once is not too bad, but this move does little for you, and gives him territory.]
;B[ho];W[bp];B[cf];W[df]LB[fj:A]C[Would C12 be appropriate here? or F16?

df: I prefer f16 or f17.  When you touch him, he will get stronger, and you don't want him strong here, since you want to reduce the center later.  Your plan should be to take all four corners while giving him as little thickness as possible, then you can reduce the center and win.

Since you jumped twice at the bottom, you should be thinking about a move around A later to attack the stone on the lower side.  If you make him strong here it will be harder to attack later.]
;B[ce];W[de];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc]
(;W[dc]C[df: an interesting idea here would be to give him the corner and get outside thickness.  Then he couldn't make a big center, and the game would be more balanced.  The fighting will get complicated, but since you gave him 2 stones, you shouldn't be afraid of a fight.  That would be consistent with your jump at the bottom.]
;B[cg]
(;W[bb]C[df: this move is very bad.  You have built a wall, so you need to extend from it.  He doesn't have to answer this move, since it's just some endgame points.  No group is threatened by it. This was your chance to attack the black stones on the upper right and prevent him from getting a big center.]
;B[jd];W[hd]C[This extension is clearly too close to your wall, so black gained here.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[ob]C[I didn't like the hane at Q13 but...?

df: the hane is no good since you don't have any interesting ladder breaker.]

;W[ac]LB[bb:A]C[df: black ends with a lot of center territory here, due to the move at "A".]
;B[nq];W[pq]C[close game? - I usually am the one playing for influence, so this territorial bias is a little new for me.

df: black is a little ahead still, but it is close, so you should be able to win.]
;B[le];W[cq];B[dq]
(;W[cr]LB[lq:A]C[df: this move is a little slow.  I would play on the right, to reduce the size of the center, and aim at invading at A.]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[qn];W[qo];B[rn]
(;W[rm]LB[pl:A]C[df: It looks like you can play at A instead and break into his center.  This move makes it too easy for him to wall off the center.]
;B[on];W[po];B[ql];W[om];B[pl]
(;W[ro]C[df: capturing the stone in the center might be bigger.]
;B[nn]LB[lq:A]C[df: the black center has gotten huge now.  White is far behind. There is no invasion left at A.]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[gk]
(;W[el]C[Looking at it now I think F7 or G7 is better?  Or is Black already too big in the center?

df: E9 might be better, but there will be a fight.  I like your move.]
;B[fj];W[fm];B[hk]
(;W[eg];B[dh];W[fg];B[hg];W[gg]LB[ge:A]C[Looking at this game today J7 looks like where white should have played?

df: this is good since it threatens the cut at A, although it looks like neither side saw the cut later.]
;B[hh]
(;W[or]LB[ge:A]C[df: now you have a cut at A (see variation), but you should play it later, since you might not end in sente.]
;B[nr];W[ns];B[ms];W[os];B[mq];W[er];B[dr]C[seems close if I play J7 now? or too late?

(;W[cl]LB[ge:A]C[df: this move is slow.  Black has answered everything, and is still ahead.   Move at C9 instead or make the cut at A now.]
;B[oq];W[pr];B[bk];W[ck];B[cj];W[bl];B[gb]C[df: now the cut is smaller.]

(;W[bj];B[bi];W[ak];B[ha];W[ib];B[rl];W[sn];B[cp]
(;W[ej]LB[co:B][ge:A]C[df: you can cut at A.  Defending at B is big.  This move ends up losing points.]
;B[ei];W[gj];B[ek];W[gi];B[fl];W[md]C[B is about 10 points ahead?  I end up losing by 8.5 ponts, but from what I can see the rest of the game doesn't really need commenting.  END OF QUESTIONS

df: B is more like 20 points ahead since he can play in the lower left in sente before defending here.]
