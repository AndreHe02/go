C[A few general comments:

1) This is a good game: both players clearly had plans and were playing their  moves for reasons. You weren't ignoring each other, but neither player was  meekly responding to the other either. In the end, the result was decided by  life and death mistakes, as it so often is in amatuer games.

2) You tend to invade and create weak groups whenever your opponent sets up a  moyo. This can be dangerous when you already have a weak group because your  opponent can often find ways of attacking both at once. At one point in the game  you had three groups without definite eyes. White didn't punish this as severely  as he might, but he still expanded his territory by threating these groups. It  is usually good to settle one weak group before  creating another.

3) When you're a long way ahead in a game, you need to think about how you can  still lose the game and take steps to stop it happening.]

LB[md:a][oc:b]C[This is not usually a good idea (better to play 'a') because it allows  Black to wedge in between the two White stones at 'b'. White ends up with a  rather weak shape - see the variation.]

(;B[qc]LB[od:a]C[This lets White get in the wedge at 'a', leaving Black with all the  cutting points.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[qe];W[md];B[ne];W[kd];B[ci]LB[cf:a][cl:b]
C[This has room to make a two-space extension in either direction (to 'a'  or 'b'), so it's a reasonable place to invade.]
;W[cg];B[cl];W[cm]LB[cq:a]C[White rightly wants to strengthen his lower left group, but I'd prefer  to do it by taking the eye space in the corner with 'a', which also threatens to  attack the lower left Black group. Playing contact moves against weak stones  encourages them to strengthen themselves, and White would like the Black left  edge group to be weak so that he can attack it later.]
;B[dl]C[Good, strengthening your weak group.];W[kp]LB[cq:a]
C[I'd still want to play 'a'. If Black plays there now, White will have to  work a bit to make two eyes for his group.]
;B[pj]LB[cq:a]C[A big point, but I still want to play 'a'. You're quite likely to get  sente from the fight anyway, so you'll still get to take a big point.]
;W[np];B[oq];W[gq];B[cq]C[Good! Defence and attack combined.]
;W[fq]C[This threatens to leave you without two eyes, but it's rather a slow  move so there's no problem responding to it.]
;B[gc]LB[bp:a]C[This is dangerous. I think your lower left group can be reduced to one  eye in the corner (see variation) and your left edge group isn't absolutely  safe, so creating another weak group is not a good idea. Having one weak group  is fine, having two (or more!) is a good way to get one of them killed.

Instead, play 'a', increasing your own eye space and weakening the White group.]

(;W[fc]C[Another contact play against a weak stone.];B[jc];W[kc]
;B[jd];W[om];B[pm]LB[pn:a][qn:b]C[Playing a contact move means the White stone is down to three liberties,  but so is your stone - and it's White's move next. If White responds with a hane  at 'a', you're down to two liberties and White will easily break into the side.  Instead, I'd prefer 'b', which takes a large corner territory and aims at  cutting off the White stone later.]

;W[dp];B[eq];W[fh]LB[eo:a]C[One idea here would be to push through at 'a', surrounding the weak  White group and tying your two groups together - see the variation.]

(;B[dh];W[dg];B[eh];W[eg];B[fi];W[gh];B[gi];W[gl];B[iq]C[My first reaction to this move was that it was a mistake. When faced  with a deep moyo, invading at the bottom of it is usually a desperation measure  used when you have to destroy most of the territory in order to win. However,  there are quite a few weaknesses in White's position and it's difficult for him  to cover them and attack your stone at the same time, so I think your move is  reasonable here.]

(;W[jr]LB[hq:a]C[White doesn't need to dive in like this - he can strengthen his position  with 'a' and still keep you to one eye on the edge (go back to see the  variation).]
;B[ir]
(;W[hr]LB[hq:a]C[Again, White can play 'a' and keep you down to one eye.]
;B[lo];W[mp];B[kn];W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[hq]LB[gr:a]C[Now if White tries to defend, e.g. with 'a', he runs into trouble - see  the variation.]

(;W[hp];B[gr];W[jl]C[Here's my guess at the position as it stands (I don't claim any great  accuracy for this):

Black
  top edge - 5 pts
  left edge - 5 pts
  bottom left - 4 pts
  bottom edge - 8 pts
  right edge - 35 pts
  total - 57 pts

White
  top left - 25 pts
  top edge - 6 pts
  left & lower edge - 15 pts
  komi - 5.5 pts
  total - 51.5 pts

So, you seem to be winning and you have sente.];B[kl];W[kk]
;B[lk];W[ml];B[mk];W[nl];B[ok]LB[pl:a]C['a' looks like the best point to strengthen your side.]
;W[nk];B[nj];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk];B[pk];W[qj];B[pi]LB[po:a]C[I don't think this is necessary. Instead, capturing the stone in atari  or just playing 'a' is enough to get a ko to kill the White group. See the  variation for what happens if White pushes through at 'a' and you try to stop  him making two eyes.]
