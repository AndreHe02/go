C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

Usually, I sent the games that I lost for review, however, I still want to find my weaknesses and mistakes in the game, so I send this game for review.

I think I am very weak in invasion and melee fighting, so would you please give me more options in these two aspects. Thanks you very much.

[lf\] Hi Jeffery, my comments will be preceded by [lf\] I will comment on invasion and melee fighting. However, I might admit that close games might prove more interesting to find faults and weaknesses.Still, this game is interesting as you both missed good occasions to wrap it up (OK, you did wrap it up after all ;)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq]C[C: Now I am ready for white invasion at R10. However....]
;W[fq]C[C: Then I played the Q10 immediately.

Q: Should I invade at C10?


[lf\] I think it is ok. The goal for white of playing R10 is to prevent the very valuable extension of Q10, ideally spaced form both corner formations. If white lets you have it, then get it, it can't be bad. Even if he gets D10 afterwards, you could then get K16 which would be another very valuable point.]
;B[pj];W[cg]C[C: Now I think I have to do some invasion, otherwise, white's territory will become huge.


[lf\] I think it is wrong to speak of territory at this point. Each player is putting a claim on some areas, might try to build a moyo, but there's definetly no territory. If you look at white's formation now, there are several things to consider. 

1 - HIs latest shimari has valuable extension points around K10, so does your corner hoshi. 

2 - There is still room to invade afterwards. In my opinion. 

I would most probably play K10 here as black.
I have shown two possible variations with invasions, but the result is that white builds thickness / influence facing black's. Which is not in black's interest. To sum up, Id'say that it's still early to invade. To capitalize on black' s begining, I would play K16.]

(;B[cl]LB[cj:A]C[Q: Is this point OK? or Having other better position?


[lf\] I don't know for sure, but this point gives white the valuable side extension to A while not giving black extraordinary prospects (consider black B4 - a small life follows). Giving white the opportunity to play C10 is not to my liking. As I said, it's still early for this]

(;W[fc]C[Q: If I insist trying to get one of the white's corner, which one is better? And how to move?

[lf\] Here if you _need_ to take one of white's corner, then the lower left is the one; by playing something like B4, and you get either the corner or something better outside. THe top left corner as such (without preparatory moves at A or B) is not invadable - unless you want to set up a ko. There's a study on this at www.goproblems.com

http://www.goproblems.com/prob.php3?id=910];B[mc]C[Q: Am I too conservative to should extend more further?


[lf\] I'd say that both are possible though your choice is nice. It opens the possiblity of playing J17 futher on. But I also think that the side group (C8) is more urgent now]
;W[cc]C[[lf\] this is overly defensive. white doesn't like to lose corners ;) now is the time to seiwe the initiative and build an enormous moyo]
;B[qd]C[C: I am afraid white will attack my corner, so I protect it first.

Q: Am I right for this?


[lf\] this is possible too, but it looks like your are both afraid of fighting, clinging on territory first.]
;W[jp];B[lq]C[[lf\] with this white should play M5 and enter your moyo]

(;W[hq];B[jr]LB[lo:A]C[
[lf\] you should have stabilized C8 long ago. This is a little bit early, white should fly into your moyo with M5.]

(;W[ir];B[jq];W[iq];B[ip];W[io];B[kp];W[jo];B[ko];W[ql]LB[ql:26]
C[C: After this move, I decided to let white to get the territory, and get the outward influence.

Q: Am I right? Or (W)26 can be isolated?

[lf\] I think white should be chased , and while being chased, give a lot of territory to black. See variations]

(;B[pm]C[Q: Is this point OK?

[lf\] let's see when the sequence is done. I think it is the wrong direction]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[qk];B[cn]C[[lf\] the fight on the right side is not over... But the results is already very good for white.]
;W[bq]
(;B[hp]LB[ci:A]C[C: I know that the ladder is work for me, so I do this to see how white moves.

[lf\] you should stabilize your weak group first. This is very very important. if white can play C10 now, you're in trouble, and he'll make territory. Territory is gained when attacking, not by clinging to it. And attack is only effective against weak groups. I would definetely have played C11 here.]
;W[ho]C[C: Those two stones have to be sacrificed, and this is in my prediction, than I did L7.

Q: Is L7 good or just L6?

[lf\] L7 or L6 is playing where you are strong. The two stones on the left are weak, this is where you should play. You should not play where you are strong, but protect your weak groups first.]
;B[km];W[rn]
(;B[ro]C[Q: Is this good? Should I pressure white at R6?

(lf) YOu should still play C11. Locally however, you should block at the top. THe bottom is not at risk. See variation.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[qh];B[ph];W[jd]C[[lf\] He finally plays the last big point - but misses the pressure on C6-C8 (playing C10)]
;B[le]
(;W[mi]C[C: I think white reduce my territory at N11 was too close. This should be played at L11.

Q: right?

[lf\] this is a bit deep, yes, but he can maybe exploit your weaknesses at the right. White should play C10 and attack the stones there. THis will give him enough strength to play deep in your moyo. (see var)]
;B[ki]LB[ki:45][mi:44]C[C: Then (W)44 was weaken.

[lf\] THere is still the risk of a sequence like the one in variation]

(;W[mg];B[kg];W[pg];B[oh];W[og];B[nh];W[lf];B[mh];W[kk]C[C: Actually, I don't know how to respond to this. so I tried M10 to see how white moves. However....

[lf\] Maybe you should cut... see variation]
(;B[lj];W[ll]C[C: Turn out, I know that M10 was bad move.]
(;B[mn]LB[ik:A]TR[kk][ll]C[C: So I have to protect my territory first.

Q: Am I right?

[lf\] I think white is weak, you should on the contrary, drive him into your territory, by cutting his connection to the right side - see var. Now his two marked stones have to live ( you can still cut at R13 too) - Remember, strength should be used to push your oponent into it !]
;W[ng]
(;B[lh]TR[qg]C[[lf\] cut !];W[kf];B[ig];W[ob]C[[lf\] white is abusive. He has 2 weak groups (L9-M8) and (R10 if you cut at R13. He cannot make a third one.]

(;B[pb]C[C: This is another time that don't know how to respond and need a couple of time to think. I think white has successfully reduced my territory.

[lf\] I think attacking white is what you should do. If you only defend territory when white attacks, you will not win.]
;W[oc];B[qb];W[od]TR[mc][le]C[[lf\] do they feel abandonned ? ;) It looks like you're helping white, by helping his weak stone (the invasion at P18) to connect to the other stones. On top of it; you'r offering the two blackies.]
;B[qf]C[[lf\] "do not peep where you can cut" The corner is alive, so you should cut at least.]
;W[qg];B[il]C[C: Now, I want to attack the middle two stones for compensation.

[lf\] THe risk here is that white sacrifices them and attacks C6-C8 see var.]

(;W[gf];B[gh];W[fm]C[Q: Should I play J15 instead?

[lf\] no, C11 ;)];B[fk];W[ci];B[bj];W[eg];B[dj]C[[lf\] good :) at last this group is ok. You both missed it for long.]
;W[if];B[hg];W[hf];B[fo]LB[go:A]C[C: I played this because I think I can kill (W)72, and finally I did.

Q: Can it be saved be white?

[lf\] yes, I think, if white plays A. see variations]
(;W[gp];B[gn];W[en];B[eo];W[do];B[dn];W[em];B[gm];W[rc]LB[pa:5]
[qa:4][rb:3][pc:1][qc:2][rd:8][pe:6][qe:7]TR[pb][qb][pd][qd]
C[C: Now, I am worrying my corner. So I think carefully, and played R17.

Q: Am I right?

[lf\] I think S18 is ok. what you don't want is a white eye in the corner, S18 prevents it. R17 is not useful for 2 reasons. 
1 - The bamboo joint (marked stones) cannot be cut
2 - it removes a liberty from your group. ( 8 liberties here)]
;B[qc]LB[pa:1][qa:2][rb:3][pc:4][rd:5][pe:7][qe:6]C[[lf\] 7 liberties here...]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[rg];W[rh];B[sg];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]C[[lf\] the key point for zero eye is S19]
;B[se];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[gk];W[rq];B[rp];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr]
;B[or]C[[lf\] there is a risk too(see var)]
(;W[qs];B[rr];W[sr];B[po]C[C: No comment!!! Just a STUPID move. Should be S1.

[lf\] no comment ;)];W[rs];B[sp];W[sq];B[os];W[ek];B[ej];W[fh]

;B[bn];W[pl];B[ol];W[qm];B[ep];W[eq]C[C: I just think I mgiht get the corner. But I was no sure, so I didn't attack.

Q: Can I get the corner?

[lf\] I think not white is already alive, and there's no stone for black to link to.]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[ch];W[bh];B[jc]C[C: Now I am trying to save those two stones. Originally, I don't think I can kill the long white dragon. But, finally I did. I just think white has a lot of wrong moves by now.

[lf\] I'm not sure, maybe you can live. Or rather white should play like L16]

(;W[kc];B[kd];W[jb];B[ic];W[kb];B[lc];W[ib];B[je];W[id];B[jf]
C[C: Cut successfully. But I think the previous sequence is wrong, so that I cannot make a living.

Q: Am I right?

[lf\] I think black should die. :)];W[ke];B[ld];W[ie];B[jg]
C[[lf\] Here I would play N15]
(;W[hc];B[mb]C[C: I don' white to connect, because I realised that I might have chance to kill white's dragon.]
;W[oa];B[ne]C[C: First, I destroy the eye.];W[oe];B[nf]C[[lf\]  white should have no problem living at the edge like with S10 even here wjite should live.]
;W[go];B[fn];W[js];B[kr];W[ks];B[ls];W[is];B[sh]C[C:]
(;W[si]C[C: Lucky, nothing to say. White should S11.

Q: If so, can I kill white?

[lf\] I think white S10 is ok.];B[ri];W[sj];B[qi]C[C: Another cut again. White is nearly dead.]
;W[rj];B[pi];W[sl];B[ma]

;B[dl];W[tt]C[C: Again, still thinking the killing procedure.]
;B[me]C[C: Then got it!!

[lf\] an eye to no eye... wins the capturing race];W[tt]C[Q: In general, what is your opion about me on this?

What aspect do you think I have weakness in or you  want me to improve?


Thank you very much for reviewing my game.

[lf\] I think you have good fighting technique, but you seem interested too much in territory right from the begining. I mean by that that you play moves whose sole interest is to secure territory, while there are more important moves (like stabilizing groups or attacking enemy groups) to play first. It didn't show too much here as your oponent has the same reaction (playing C17 for example - a superfluous move). Overall, I would say that if you manage to protect your groups a little better, and you're not afraid of attacking early on, you will make swift progress.
Another thing is that by being so concerned by territory, you are too gentle with your oponent (see Q18 for example).]
