C[GP: Hi, I'm Graham, and will try to point out key points in this game both in terms of Black's play and White's play that Black didn't exploit as well as could have been. I will prefix my comments with GP, and summarise at the end. Please send any questions that you have with the review to the email address you received it from :)]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp];W[pq];B[po];W[mq]
(;B[ql]C[GP: This is unreasonably passive. With White's extension to N3 you've given him a further big followup with R5 giving a nice corner, and leaving R8 out of place after you defend. Better to take R3 yourself, and it's big enough to play now (as otherwise Q5 is a solitary stone) -- see variations.]

(;W[df];B[jd]C[GP: Very good choice of direction.];W[qp]C[GP: This is a thank you move, less severe than wR5 and lets you get a nice position on the right hand side.]
;B[qo]C[GP: Obvious, but can't be left out either :)];W[nc]
;B[oc]C[GP: This isn't the best response here really. You are going to force White to become stronger. In a high handicap game this makes sense as you are making White heavy and squeezing him against the K16 stone. However, that's partly because as Black has a presence at D16 in a high handicap game K16 is a useful attacking stone. In this case if you make White strong, you start attacking your own stone. Better to threaten from a distance with R14 - simply make life hard for this White stone and profit while doing so.]
;W[kc];B[nd]C[GP: Good! wL17 should have been here.];W[qc];B[qd]
;W[nb];B[ob]C[GP: Again, good, White's made a mess of this and Black has an excellent position.]
;W[jc];B[rp];W[rq];B[pp]C[GP: These exchanges aren't that valuable for Black here. They are sente, but slightly aji-keshi - at the very least they'd make potent ko threats. Better to focus on K16 with a move such as H16, lightly restricting White's influence on the top.]
;W[qq];B[id]C[GP: I'd prefer H16 as it's a bit lighter and more flexible. Black doesn't want to make a heavy group here.]
;W[gc]C[GP: Should be at H17.];B[ic]C[GP: Good, this is big.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[ib]
(;B[le]C[GP: Understandable tenuki to go for the kill, but H18 is huge. It's still sente, and Black's extra strength will make White's corner much more vulnerable. Letting White connect underneath was very big.]
;W[hc];B[ge]C[GP: This is a bit vague. Having played M15 the only consistent direction is a move designed to use Black's thickness, perhaps N5 or tengen.]
;W[qg];B[qi]C[GP: Good response.];W[og];B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[lh]

(;B[mg]C[GP: This is slightly ajikeshi unless it was required for your own connection. Better to play something like N11 and then N15 (see variation).]
;W[mh];B[ld];W[lc];B[me]C[GP: It's horrible to have to end in gote here. M16 reduced the aji that simply playing N15 first would have left, and White's next move (Q8) is made more severe due to the stronger White wall with N12.]
;W[pl]
(;B[nl]C[GP: One stone against one stone, you must respond more locally than this.bQ9 or bQ7 are the most obvious responses, but you can't really prevent White from running out here.]
;W[qm];B[qk];W[on];B[pm];W[pn]
(;B[om]C[GP: White's P6 and Q6 were very good moves. bS7 is essential here - connect underneath and keep some pressure up (see variation).]
;W[qn];B[nn];W[oo];B[no];W[op];B[np];W[nq]C[GP: This is a massive result for White, a real ripoff. At least 20 points just changed hands here.]
;B[ko];W[jq]
(;B[ch]C[GP: Black's in a difficult position here. This is big without any doubt, but White's storming ahead in territory with that bottom right corner, and Black's influence is only useful if White cannot settle his middle group into the corner. Better to focus on hurting that group with your newfound thickness while it is so weak (see variation).]
;W[cg];B[bh]C[GP: Wrong side. D12 is definitely better, especially as Black is relying on an influence game now and cannot easily afford wD12.]
;W[bg];B[eh];W[re];B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rc];W[lg]
(;B[qe]C[GP: You can do better! first respond in sente and then you have a useful tesuji.]
;W[rf];B[qf];W[rg];B[ng];W[oh]
(;B[jg]C[GP: If you are pushing to kill, play out wider than this. White's going to be relying on the middle (Although the sequence in the top right allows wS11 for a guaranteed eye in sente or two eyes in gote) so restrict the space he can make there]
;W[jh];B[lj];W[kj];B[li];W[ki];B[ij];W[ig];B[jf];W[hi];B[fj]
C[GP: At this stage White has two eyes, and Black should make alternative plans (such as building territory in this corner). Before doing so, a score count is very important though.

White has around 30 points in the lower right,about 10 at the top, and about 20 in the upper left, making 60 points or so of solid territory. Black has about 15 in the top right, about 10 in the middle right, and influence in the order of maybe 15 points on left, so about 40 points. With komi, that makes 25 points that need catching up already. If the 15 points on the left can be turned into 40, then that's a reasonable plan, although moves doing so will be gote and White will pick up more points in the meantime. In reality, that's probably not enough. Unless you can secure a kill, the game is most likely over now.]

[cr][dr][hr][as][bs][cs][ds][es][fs][gs]C[GP: The biggest issues in this game were allowing the connection underneath in the top middle, the ripoff in the bottom right, and not sufficiently pressuring th middle group when doing so would have been more profitable.

The kill at the top was excellent, and that combined with the ripoff on the bottom gave you a well fought victory, but strategically the game was lost earlier on in ways that could have been avoided. The primary failure in that regard was using the initiative to keep White's groups as weak as possible - both the top group earlier on and the group on the right middle for the middle chunk of the game.

I hope some of the comments are useful to you, and please do ask if you have any questions :)]
