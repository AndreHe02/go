C[hi i play white.
i play a few games with comp.program before. ok, then i told to play human as many as i can.
so, here is my first game againts real human.

i think i really screwed this game up. i believe i missed the basic technique. i dont know how to move my stone. but of course i know how the two eyes work. but it don't help but only give a few point.
:(

i play well on 9x9 board (againts bot). but i think 19x19 is a very different one. hehe..
dear reviewer, please help me so i can play on 19x19 board to...

also please give a little comment about black's moves so i can learn from his move too..
thanks in advadce];B[pd]C[kdrlkeswav: hi];W[dp];B[cd]TR[dd]
[dc]C[sung [?\]: hi

and how if black on d17? wich one is better?];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq]

kdrlkeswav: tx

fiuuhhh. almost my groups were all dead and i got only a few points. thats ok so i can study much more

i want to play with human much more, but with my ability i think im not ready for it. i should stick to play with robot for a while

Reviewer: I would recommend playing many more games soaking in the simple mistakes you are making. I would also suggest that you pick up a book on the fundamentals of go and do your best to study as much tsumego as possible. :)]
