Hi, thanks for reviewing this game, i don't know why i lost it, maybe i should have spent some time counting.
If you notice something looking like a mistake please tell me. :)

I only hope I haven't comented to much. When I get in the mood I can get quite annoying...  :)]

(;W[pk]C[What's the best way to get out there? Q9 looks ok i think, but i don't like the idea of a Q9-Q8 exchange.

Then extend to O or P 10 instead, the drawback is that you tell Black that you might rather run then fight. But to play any move around that group for black is just too slow, If B makes an attack at least it should be around P13.]

Cutting is alwas good, a friend told me. what he didn't tell me was that I had to read deep on every possible answer....
What i think he ment is cut when you can cut otherwise don't. (wery simlpe to say enormously hard to do)

It's no problem as long as you can keep B dead or running for his life.]

Looking back at this game D5 might be the move that cost you the game. It sure was expensive....

When I get stuck and don't know where to play, I think like this:
1 Must I answer anywere?
2 Any big points(territory)moves left?
3 Where can I cause the most damage to my opponent? 
And if I still don't know and it's an tornament I take a litle walk to clear the mind, it problably got focused an small part of the borad.
If I still don't know?!?! I play a damemove or pass....])
