C[I'm White and I lossed by 7.5.

[DP The main points I noticed when reviewing your game were as follows:
1) You could be more aggressive, particularly in the opening and early middle game.  There were a couple of moves which lacked fighting spirit - K3 and G4 for example, and P12 later in the game
2) Overly defensive moves, such as E4, which let B continue with attacks which should have been stopped
3) There was some rash play at the top right, when you invaded unreasonably into a strong B area, and got suitably mashed for your troubles!
4) Learn to recognize when a play isn't working, and IMMEDIATELY leave it.  It is a hard thing to do, but would increase your playing strength by at least 3 stones. R18 and H8 are examples from your game
5) Think about the score.  See move 100.  Here you played a really small move when there was still a lot to play for on the board
6) Look for double sente moves in the endgame - these are moves where if you play first he must answer, or if he plays first you must answer.  They are BIG and should be played a lot earlier in the game than you were doing\]]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[qk];W[fq]C[I wasn't really sure what I was suposed to do here. I think that I should have gone closer to the side.

[DP This is an ok corner enclosure for W, although a little open.  More standard moves against the chinese opening are around K4 or O17\]]
;B[jp];W[lq]C[[DP This is no time to be invading with all those big points still open.  You can make an ideal extension from your shimari at D10, and should do so\]]
;B[np]C[[DP Sensible response from B, putting pressure on W stone and increasing influence on the right side at the same time\]]
;W[jq]C[[DP Lacks fighting spirit.  Keep B separated by jumping into the centre with M5\]]
;B[lp]C[[DP Again, good pressing move from B who will be happy with the way things have started\]]
;W[kp]C[[DP Good, this creates some cutting points\]];B[ko]
;W[kq];B[lo];W[ip]
(;B[fc]C[[DP I think better to connect K5 for solidity.  A W ponnuki here would be very strong\]]

(;W[dj]C[[DP Good - this is an excellent point\]];B[df];W[fd]
C[[DP Yes, attach against stronger stone, which you have correctly done\]]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[fb]
(;W[bc]C[[DP Poor choice as this move gives up sente. A better move would be G16.  B playing at B16 is no threat to you\]]
;B[bb];W[ok]C[[DP The erasure of B moyo is more difficult because of the timid K3 move earlier. However, this is the correct way to start\]]
;B[pm]C[[DP This is from the wrong direction.  B is strong in bottom right, and so should play Q11 to push W towards his thickness\]]
;W[qj]
(;B[jd]C[[DP Ouch - that situation at R10 needs resolution - not the time to tenuki. B should simply draw back at R8, or perhaps better play aggressively at Q10\]]

(;W[nm]C[[DP W stays in the correct area, although Q9 better for making shape. See variation\]]
;B[on]C[[DP B should be cutting W to pieces here, instead of focusing on territory\]]
;W[nn]
(;B[no]C[[DP Unreasonable paranoia from B, who is too strong to be hurt here. Better Q9 and cut\]]
;W[om];B[pn];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj]C[[DP W has got away with murder here!\]]
;B[jo]C[[DP This move is more powerful than it looks, and lays the ground for the later decimation of W left hand side\]]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[ff]C[[DP Better to  threaten from afar with a move like G16\]]
;B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[cf];B[io]C[[DP Good from B again, beginning to recover from his poor response to the P9 sequence\]]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[gp]C[[DP Fighting spirit says push up at G5 here\]]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[en];W[dn];B[fo];W[go]C[[DP Good move putting cutting points into B shape\]]
;B[gn]
(;W[ep]C[[DP it would be better to stop B getting into the left hand side, and the push-through is nothing to be worried about. A costly mistake, given what happens later on in the game\]]
;B[dm];W[cn];B[cm];W[em];B[el];W[qc]C[[DP Good invasion at the correct time\]]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[pc]C[I think here I should have gone at S17

[DP Yes, S17 links to R14 in this shape. See variation\]]
(;W[re];B[rc];W[qb]C[[DP This removes a potential ko threat you would have had for later, and strengthens B.  Poor move, which is not hard to read\]]
;B[rb];W[ob]C[[DP Ouch.  Throwing good money after bad, here!  If anything, you should be playing on the other side with a move like O14 to create some territory on the right, or O9 to shore up the left hand side, or G16 to threaten B at the top\]]

C[I feel I should have saved that stone.

[DP Well, you should never have been playing in that area, really :-) \]]

;B[bk];W[ci];B[ah]
(;W[fp]C[[DP A truly horribly small move!  By now, 100 moves into the game, you should have some idea what the score is, and play accordingly.  Here is an approximation:
B
Top Left           15
Top Right        15
Bottom Right  30
Centre Left        5
Prisoners          2

so you are behind and need to do something, like trying to make a centre moyo with G8 (sente) followed by O14\]]
;B[fm]C[[DP B correctly removes some aji and becomes much stronger in the centre\]]
;W[ie]C[[DP O14 still miles better.  Be aware of how strong the ponnuki shape is - so if you want to reduce its influence, you need to play a little further from it, say J14\]]
;B[gk]C[[DP B is playing too close to his own thickness here, which W can take advantage of\]]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[hk]C[[DP The cut is ok as long as you intend it to be a sacrificial stone so that you can retain sente\]]
;B[ik];W[hl]C[[DP Good money after bad again\]];B[il];W[gl]
;B[fk];W[hi]C[[DP Luckily W comes to his senses just in time!\]]

[DP E9 is tiny and not forcing.  What you did is the correct move\]]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[gi];W[ek];B[fl]

;B[kg];W[lk];B[kk];W[ml];B[ng]C[[DP This move effectively seals the game in favour of B\]]

C[Probably should have saved that stone.

[DP Well, either save it, or defend the cut at P11.  You can't afford to ignore both. Saving it would have been the better option, giving you around 20 points on right hand side\]]
;W[lm];B[mk]C[[DP Now defend P11\]];W[kl];B[lk];W[km]
(;B[jl]C[[DP Unnecessary from B, and gives W a "get out of jail free card".  He already has an eye around A8, and another when he captures H8 stones.  So he should cut at P11 right now, or play the big endgame moves like O2 or S9 (see variation)\]]
;W[kf]C[[DP What is this move trying to achieve?  You need to defend the cut at P11. That would have been enough for you to have a chance in the game. Score approximation IF you had played P11:
