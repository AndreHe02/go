RE[W+14.50]
RU[Chinese]

C[NR: Hello Robert and Happy New Year!  All my comments are preceded by NR. First of all, I should mention that this is a game that you could have won if you were a bit more careful. Pitty to lose the group and allow white to live at the bottom left. We will see more during the review.

General comments
---------------------------
1) Try to decide what you want to get out of a situation, and then play reasonable and thought-out moves to get what it is that you want. Wanting everything is not allowable, and in fact, in Go it is punishable.

2) Try to keep sente, especially during end game.

3) Avoid the empty triangle, as in most cases it is a terrible move. A one point jump (towards making the bamboo joint) is a better choice usually.

4) Make your groups safe before attacking. Making a base is important. See move 7 and the variation.

5) Try to find efficient moves. Big moves before small moves. Also urgent moves before big moves.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I hope this review will help you in your endeavour to play better.

Nicholas

;W[pe]LB[ip:B][iq:A]C[NR: You may want to consider the Chinese or the low Chinese fuseki with these moves. You need to study it first though. It is a territory focused opening and there is a good book by Kato Masao on this opening.]
;B[nc];W[pc]
(;B[od];W[pd]C[NR: This exchange helps white connect, while not offering much to black. Better to avoid such exchanges. You help white become strong and guard the corner extremely well. (See variation)]
;B[cf];W[lc]C[NR: Now your base-less (i.e. weak) stones are under attack.]
;B[mc];W[le];B[lb];W[kb]
(;B[la];W[kc]
(;B[oe]C[NR: In the sequence that follows, black group fights to make 2 eyes and live, in an area that could otherwise be secure for him (i.e. by first playing L17 and making a base.]
;W[og]
(;B[nf]C[NR: I don't like this move very much. Perhaps the variation at N15?]

(;B[md]C[NR: Do you really need to answer this?];W[pb];B[na]
;W[ng]LB[fc:C][bd:B][pj:A];B[fc]C[NR: A stronger player would probably say that this move is too close to the white wall. Perhaps you could extend around Q10 at this time?]
;W[hc];B[ee];W[ec]C[NR: First decide what you want to get out of a fight. That would help you decide what move to play. What is the purpose of E18?]
;B[eb];W[gc];B[dc];W[ed];B[fd];W[db];B[cc];W[fb]
(;B[gb]TR[eb]C[NR: You force white to capture E18 and you also lose the cutting stone at G18. A pointless move that can only be said to help white solidify his position. 
--> See variations starting with C16, where black takes advantage of the situation to build outward influence.]
;W[ea];B[cd]C[NR: Now C16 is not a forcing move.];W[fe];B[ff]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[de]
(;B[df];W[ef];B[eg]
(;W[be]C[NR: I don't understand this move. (See possible outcomes for white with C15 in the variation.)]
;B[ce];W[dg]C[NR: A pointless cut for white.]
(;B[dh]C[NR: E12 creates a more solid position. I feel that D13 is not so threatening soas to atari it here. 
With D12 white gets a chance to cut at F13 in sente as in the actual game.
Also note that you have the move at E15, which would allow you to connect (or damage white seriously).]
;W[fg]TR[ff][gf]C[NR: Still, remember the move at E15. See variation, which allows you to keep your two marked stones connected.]

(;B[cg];W[gg];B[hf];W[ee];B[hg];W[eh]
(;B[fh]C[NR: This seems to be the reason you created the trouble with the marked group. See variations.]
;W[gh];B[ei];W[hh]
(;B[ig]TR[hf][hg]C[NR: Here you formed the empty triangle, a usually bad shape that you should avoid. See variation for better shape, though it is doubtful to me that the two stones deserved so much attention. Perhaps you should leave them and play a big move around Q10 or K4? To save the group you should have played the earlier variation showed.]
;W[ih];B[jh]C[NR: This hane is unreasonable, and allows white to easily cut and capture the black group.]
;W[jg];B[ji]C[NR: An atari on white's part would perhaps be more appropriate here.]

(;W[ie];B[gi];W[if];B[ii];W[he]
(;B[pm]LB[pj:A]C[NR: I think it's a good idea to extend, but you could perhaps extend much further, up to Q10 (at A). Now white has a chance to play there.]

(;W[qh];B[pj];W[qj];B[pk];W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[NR: This move is too passive. Why allow white to get so much with a bad move. R8 seems like an overplay to me. See variation with a cut.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[pi]LB[ip:B][jp:A][iq:C]C[NR: Could extend further.]
;B[mp]C[NR: Again, your extension could be more efficient.]
;W[ep]LB[dn:A][eo:C][eq:B]C[NR: You may study a bit this joseki. I don' t know much about josekis myself, but I feel you could press the approaching stone more. My usual response would be B.]
;B[cn]LB[cq:A]C[NR: White has now the chance of playing at C3 (at A).]

(;W[dq]C[NR: This white move seems too small/slow/inefficient.]
;B[cq];W[gq]
(;B[jq]C[NR: Good! Since white played this way, press him. Even J3. Yes, J3 would be more severe.]

;W[lq];B[lr]
(;W[jr]C[NR: Here you got lucky. If white played L3, see the variation and continuation! Black has no chance to live (or very few chances if a stronger player can think of something :-) ).]

;B[gs];W[rl];B[fp]C[NR: Very good!];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm]C[NR: White tries to complicate things, so that he can escape. Your role is simple. Keep it simple! Play safe. See variations.
To be honest, after studying the position a bit and looking at variations, I would say that even the way you played, white should not have a chance to live, let alone for the one mistake you made.]
