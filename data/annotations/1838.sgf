AB[dp][dj][dd][pp][pj][pd]C[AlanC: Starting with a handicap of 6 stones the result I found disappointing. Apart from the blunders on the right edge where did I lose the game?]
PL[B];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[pr]C[The joseki for W is to play somewhere on the 3rd line (P3, Q3 or R3).]
;B[pq];W[mq]
(;B[qr]C[B could play P2 (see variation). But B could also play K16 or F3.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[jd];B[nc]C[B D2 would also be good, securing the corner and preparing an invasion at the bottom.]
;W[fc];B[cf];W[ci]C[W should invade on the right side instead, where the black moyo is larger.]
;B[cj];W[dh]
(;B[dc]C[B D17 is much too kind. B should attack the weak white group (see variation). The handicap stones must be used for attack, not to make territory.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[eg]C[W gets away too easily.];B[ee];W[fe]
(;B[fd]C[B should cut at F14 instead (see variation).];W[gd]
;B[ed]C[The exchange of B E16 for W G14 is not good for B. B should just play elsewhere now (R10 for example).]
;W[gf]C[W is very happy with this result.];B[ip];W[jq];B[fo]
;W[go]
(;B[in]C[To be consistent with F5, B should play G6 instead and just consider J4 as a forcing move since W played submissively at K3 (see variation). If B wanted to play at J6, then the F5/G5 exchange was not needed.]
;W[ho];B[io];W[fn];B[eo];W[fj];B[en]C[If B want to reinforce in this area, B D2 is better. But B N5 would be better, to help the middle B group and enlarge the moyo on the right.]
;W[im]C[W should not attack with a contact play.];B[ko];W[hq]
;B[iq];W[ir];B[gn]C[What is black trying to do? After W played F10, there is not much territory here. B should play N5.]
;W[hn];B[gm]C[B N5 would still be better.];W[hm];B[fl]C[B ends in gote and has gained very little.]
;W[gl];B[fm];W[fk];B[ek];W[el];B[dl];W[ej];B[dk];W[mo]C[... W gets the important point!]
;B[kn]C[B has a heavy group now.];W[nj];B[pm];W[nl]C[W should play N7 instead.]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[on];B[mm];W[om];B[ml];W[nk];B[jm];W[jl]
;B[kl];W[jk];B[kk]C[B is alive but the right side is damaged.]
;W[kj];B[mk]C[B was already alive so this move is not necessary. B should defend the right side instead.]
;W[mj];B[po]C[The two black stones are not very important now. It would be better to consolidate the right side with B R7.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[ql];B[pn]C[B Q6 is not necessary. Wasting a move at this point of the game is very costly.]
;W[pi]C[W is strong in this area and should not play a contact move. W could play Q13 instead.]
;B[qf]C[There is still some aji (potential) left for W at R17. To secure the corner, B would have to play R15 instead of R14. B could also play N14 to reduce the W moyo.]
;W[me];B[di];W[ei]
(;B[bi]C[B B11 is too timid. B can capture at C12 (see variation).]
;W[ch];B[bh];W[of]
(;B[qc]C[B can reinforce at R12 instead (see variations).];W[dr]

(;B[dq]C[The correct answer is at C3, not D3 (see variation).]
;W[cr];B[cq]C[The bad shape (empty triangle) shows that D3 was not good.]
;W[bq];B[br]C[B should simply play B4 instead of B2.];W[bs]
;B[bp];W[eb];B[db];W[lc]C[M17 was very big.];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[qj];B[qk]C[R9 does not achieve much. A3, N18 and P2 bigger. (A3 is sente, threatens E2).]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[pk];B[rl]C[B ends in gote so has lost the opportunity of playing A3 or N18 in sente.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[mb];B[nb];W[cg];B[bg];W[ar]C[A2 is big, B should have captured first.]
;B[ap]C[P2 is much bigger.];W[qg];B[rg];W[pg];B[pf];W[oe];B[pe]
C[Q15 is not needed. Another wasted move... B should play P2.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[mc];B[nd];W[ne];B[eq];W[er]
(;B[fp]C[B should not reinforce W. There was a tesuji at H2 (see variations).]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[gp];B[jp];W[kq];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[mr];B[kp]
C[L4 is worth half a point in gote, this is too small. E19 is worth 4 points in reverse sente.]
;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[ns];B[ps];W[oj];B[ma]C[N19 is gote. B should play N16 sente first.]

;W[br];B[dg];W[eh];B[ec];W[gb];B[oo];W[ol];B[lo];W[sh];B[rf]
;W[sk];B[rm];W[sj];B[sg];W[sl];B[sm];W[pj];B[si]C[T11 is worth half a point, B should play M4 first (one point in sente).]
KO[];W[lp];B[hc]C[This invasion it totally hopeless so it is not polite to do it. Invade only when there is some aji left.]
;W[gc];B[kb];W[lb];B[kc];W[kd];B[hb];W[hd];B[he];W[ge];B[hf]
C[H14 is a one point gift. W could ignore.];W[id];B[ij];W[jj]
;B[hl];W[gk];B[hk]C[Again, W could ignore this.];W[hj];B[hi]
;W[gj];B[ii]C[B should not have played all these moves. J11 is another gift of one point to W.]
;W[sh]KO[];B[lr]C[This is another gift, not a threat. W can ignore because there is still a liberty at P4.]
;W[lq];B[si]KO[];W[pc];B[pb];W[sh]KO[];B[ik]C[Another gift.]
;W[si];B[il];W[hr];B[jh];W[ki];B[kh];W[lh];B[le]C[Another gift. W can pass.]
;W[ld];B[lg];W[mg]C[W can play J13 instead to remove any hope for B.]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[mf];W[ng];B[lf];W[jf];B[jg]C[Another gift, W can pass. B can make only one eye at best.]
;W[if];B[ig]C[Another gift, W can pass. B can make only one eye at best.]
;W[hg];B[hh]C[Another gift. W can pass. B would have only one eye anyway even after capturing G13.]
;W[gg]C[In this game, black has played too many useless or very small moves. Play urgent moves before big moves, but if there are no urgent moves, always look for the biggest move.

Also, it is not polite to play totally hopeless moves. You can try invasions, but only if they have at least some hope of succeeding. You also risk losing points if your invasion is ignored.]
