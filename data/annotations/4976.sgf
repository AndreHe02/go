C[Hi, I first believed the review was for white, so you will get a comment for white's moves as well.

Since you didn't make any comments in the game, i commented the whole game and insisted on the invasions.]
;B[qd];W[cd];B[cp];W[eq];B[pq];W[jd]C[
to white:
you prevented the shimari instead of taking the corner, good.
Now use it.
K16 seems to be of much less value than a move at G4 maybe or C2 (not sure though)]
;B[ep];W[do];B[pe]TR[oc][ed][qo][dp]C[There is a saying that says: even  a moron connects against a peep.
This is a peep.

Don't worry,  i was the moron once.

Moreover your move does not much. TRiangles are better.
First P17 on the same side than K16
Then R5, or E16. But the connection is absolutely needed.]
(;W[od]C[it seems that the moves are played the wrong way.
you should play Q15 only after w plays P16.
However when you play Q15 white should use the stone he just played.

;W[mc];B[mf];W[qc]C[to white:
small. the cut at D4 is MUCH bigger. Or  prevent black getting too big of a territory on the right side]

(;B[qe]C[useless, you may want to play somewhere around the triangles.

see var.];W[sc]C[useless there are bigger moves on the board.]

(;B[sd]C[ouch you put yourself in a difficult position here.
See var.];W[rd];B[re];W[se]C[same];B[sf];W[sd]C[All this sequence was very small. white doesn't get the corner at all. It even gives it to black (see var.)]

(;B[dp]C[At first i thought that the connection was important, however it may not be as big as it looks. Now you won't get any territory from the lower part of the board. You can however, play at F3 and take the corner or get some strength to play somewhere else on the board.

it may be interesting to play at S13 to make your wall completely safe, and be able to make good use of it

If we take a look at the board now white has about 30 points in the top right, and good propects about the top in general.
Black has a huge wall but no real territory. It may be time to use your wall, or try an attack on the upper white territory.]

you can't kill such a big group, you should play somewhere else on the board

THe square is important since it connects your weak group to a safe one.
Triangles are good to secure territory.
the circle could be played to prevent  black from getting any territory but it is not really the pointof the game.

So far i would say the game is hardly losable for white

you should still play on the triangles from move 45];B[po]C[Gooood!!!]

You ended up losing by a lot because you couldn't make your top left group live, and You let white get too much strength that he was able to turn into territory (and you didn't see some tesujis that would have allowed you to kill two groups.)

About your question on how to kill invading stones, i would answer that you can't expect to kill every stone the opponent plays to attack you, but try to gain something from harassing the invading stones. 

Next i tried to kill the lower right group.

To improve:
  __You should try to evaluate the value and purpose of your moves.

- Why would you play here?
- what will white play as an answer?
- generally, what will you gain by playing there? what about white?
