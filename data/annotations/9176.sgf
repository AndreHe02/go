C[Hi, Paul Babinski here. Thanks for the game to review. I am a 5 kyu on IGS (xpmbx) and so you can kinda sorta trust that I'm not going to lead you totally astray in what follows. My apologies if anything I say is terribly, terribly wrong.

I wrote this on the iPad using a program called SmartGo Kifu. It's a great, elegant and well supported program, so if you have an iPad you should pick up SmartGo.

As a kind of introduction I'd like to begin with the question, how do you win as an 18 kyu? I suppose one always wins a go game the same way - by getting more territory - but when you start out there is a particular set of skills that you can get the hang of quickly and which give you the advantage over other double digit kyus. I'd like to quickly run through them, since they are pretty broad concepts that will come up in the review as well.

Fast development. I can't stress this enough. If you can tell the basic difference between a slow move and a proper one in the fuseki, that will put you ahead consistently. Go out and buy Opening Theory Made Easy, by Otake Hideo, and study it. Easily the best book I read as a beginner. If you can get a good sense for the opening at 18 kyu you'll consistently have an advantage for the next steps in your development as a player. The book does something else, too, which is even more important. It trains the feeling you have for the relative advantage or disadvantage of your board position vs your opponents. Early on we tend to just see territory and think "oh no. Look how much territory my opponent has!" This encourages players to act greedily and invade at inopportune times. When you have an understanding of how a game optimally begins, it's easier to measure both players against that mark and to compare black's position to white's position.

Good shape. No empty triangles! Early on making good shape is something like having faith in the baduk gods. You don't know how it will help you, but you trust somewhere down the line having your stones arranged solidly will give you sente, let you counter attack and play elsewhere on the board.

Recognizing Sente/Gote. Mid game is all about stringing together sente moves. Sente means your opponent is going to have to react to what you do. Gote means they can play elsewhere. Try this experiment. Ask yourself with every move if it is sente or gote, then measure your assessment of the situation against your opponents response to your move.

Counting and comparing. In go there is almost always more than one proper move on the board at any time. Get into the practice of looking at the whole board and finding multiple possible moves and then trying to figure out which is better. Give yourself a mental checklist (something like... 1) survey whole board, 2) find three possible move and 3) justify your choice for the best of them) and don't let yourself place a stone until youve completed it. Also: Do you know about ko battles? They are pure, unadulterated go awesomeness and they all come down to knowing what moves are bigger than other moves. The ninja of ko's weapon of choice is counting, and when you've mastered that you can pull yourself out of all sorts of sticky situations by daring your opponent to best you in a ko.

Endgame. When the game reaches the end game it should slow to a crawl, because assessing the relative worth of the numerous remaining moves is tough work. It's grunt work, actually, but it's worth it. Make yourself go from move to move and say "that's worth X points in sente/gote/reverse sente". If your opponent is playing quickly, he or she has little idea what is going on and you should make them wait while you work out what is what. There's a level on which quickly working through positions is an acquired skill but even at the beginning a lot of it is just a question of putting in the effort. Don't let your opponent rush you. Take your time. That was I think the most noticable thing about this game. The late mid game and endgame were sloppy and it was clear neither player was thinking carefully about the whole board. This isn't really a question of ability but patience.]

This is handy to remember. Especially as a double digit kyu, it's pretty common for opponents to live in your territory if there's enough of it, even if they "shouldn't." It happens twice in this game. Don't make it easy for them. Just extend to k4.]

;W[im]C[One of the better pieces of advice I got as a double digit kyu was "cut a lot."

So on that level I like this cut. It gives the game more action and gives the more skilled fighter a chance to gain the advantage.

But let's take a look at the whole board and do some prognosticating. If we didn't know how this game turns out, what would we think might happen over the course of the next 20 or so moves? 

If black tries to save the stones at g7 by pulling them out. White will try to keep up the pressure and maybe, just maybe, get some profit along the left side in the process, that is, if black is slow enough moving out. But look at that black stone at d16. When you're thinking about how this chase will turn out, that guy over there should worry you, because he just looks like he's going to come in handy. You're picking a fight with someone who already has reinforcements!

And what about white's cutting stone? As the black group pulls out towards safety it's also beefing up, putting more pressure on the white group to its right. Will that white group live? Sure. But for every point it scrapes together black, gleefully attacking it, will gain a number more. Sure, this is to be expected. You're entering black's domain, after all. But it's a tough fight, and once it's over you are going to have many fewer options on the top and the right.]

(;B[hl]C[The dreaded empty triangle. A sure sign that black has done something wrong. How to react? Whatever the reponse is, it should take advantage of black's poor shape. one option is to move to attack directly with j8 and threaten both the three stones and the cut at l6. Another option is to move out starting with k7 and the one space jump toward the top, which lets black fix his weakness at the cutting point k7 but has the advantage of being solid.

K8 works, too, but I think it leaves too much choice to black about how to handle the situation.]

(;W[jl];B[jm];W[il];B[hk]
(;W[kn]C[Here you throw away a stone to make black thicker and weaken your middle stones.

Sometimes there is a temptation as a dd kyu to play a move that your opponent can easily refute in the hope that they somehow miss the right response. This looks like that kind of move. 

By cutting when black can easily capture the cutting stone, you limit your future options.]
;B[km];W[ln]C[White makes thing worse. You are playing too quickly. That must be it. Slow down. If you are playing online, use up most of your time. If you are playing with a friend, test the limits of their patience. It will improve your play and your friends and at least get rid of moves like this from your game.]
;B[lm];W[kk]
(;B[mn]C[Black passes when he has the chance to take the initiative for a while.]
;W[ki];B[jj]C[I dont like the timing of this peep. Why strengthen white when the move doesn't do much to fix the problem those 4 stones sitting there awkwardly and potentionally in danger. Black is investing in stones that he might want to sacrifice later. If white captueres those stones that is all of 8 points. There are bigger points on the board.]
;W[kj];B[jk]C[Why is what black is doing here wrong? 

These are forcing moves. Black knows what white is going to do. 

Forcing moves are handy, but like everything in go, they are an exchange. You have to weigh what black gets vs. what white gets out of this.

Here, black doesn't correct the weaknesses in his position. The cut starting with j9 is still there. On the other hand, black has limited his options - perhaps he will want to peep from the other side later in the game - and left white even stronger. While white was already solid with the diagonal move at l9 and the one space jump to  l11, now it is going to be an even more difficult for black to threaten that group.]
;W[kl]C[Things look much better for white. Black has weak stones, white has versitile floating group with a bunch of liberties.]
;B[lk]C[This kind of move should set off alarm bells. It is wrong, really wrong. Black basically passes by throwing a fly against a big wall.

The mantra should be: attack from a distance. If black played around q10 he could take some territory in exchange. Black shouldnt play on this side at all, actually, since he can be cut so easily on the left.]
;W[ji]C[This is good, but white should just cut, since this lets black fix his shape.]

(;B[ii]C[Big mistake. White gets a second chance at the cut!]
;W[ik]C[Yes!];B[ij]C[Cut cut cut!!!

The cut is reeeaallly good for white and, either way, you should not have played at j9 if you didn't plan to cut.]

(;W[kg]C[Nooooo! Moving out is something you should think about, but that cut is a big chance for you.]
;B[do]C[Big mistake. Black seems to be doing that thing where one player plays unreasonably in the hope that the other player just slips up. White responds well, though c6 would be better, I think.]

(;W[eo];B[cn];W[co];B[dm];W[dp];B[cm];W[ek]C[Good job! Black has a weak group and he just made another, keep them separated! You can also just cut at h10]
;B[el]C[This sort of move is never a good idea];W[fl];B[fk]
C[Never allow ponnuki so easily.];W[dl];B[gl]C[This is a mistake. Black had a group that was awkwardly unprepared for a cut at h10 and now he's formed an empty triangle to remove one of his own liberties. You have to cut at this point.]

(;W[gj]C[Why peep when you can cut at h10?];B[hj];W[fj];B[ih]
C[Slow. j13 is better];W[jg]C[Unnecessary and slow. Black can't cut.]
;B[ig];W[je];B[he]C[Ok, so you've been putting pressure on black's center group - if black loses it the game is basically over - and now it looks like black has safely escaped and white has to start worrying about his own group.

Though you should notice that black still has an awkward group and his connection isn't that solid. You should think about hassling it for profit or seeing if you can get black to mishandle the group sometime down the line. So in a situation like this take a second and consider ways of cutting off that group. So, for instance, consider how black has to respond to h16..

Or which moves around g14 are sente

Clearly, black has to respond to g14 .... But the same is true with g12, too.

You don't need to play these moves now, but somewhere down the line those moves might be multi purpose, attacking other stones or helping to solidify your position.]

(;W[nc]C[The right idea, though black could start a fight. Imagine if black had played at q11 and not m9. He would be in a much better position to pick a fight here.]

(;W[le]C[There are moments when you should play lightly with your stones. This is not one of them, since that n16 stone could be valuable in capturing black's m16 stone, and your white group doesn't need to make life.]
;B[me];W[kd];B[md]C[Small];W[hc];B[lf];W[ke]C[Small. White should just play elsewhere.]
;B[kf]C[This move is never worth it, black only removes one of his liberties with this move.]
;W[jf];B[mf]C[Ok, lets take a second to look at the whole board

You could have left the white group sitting there and played elsewhere earlier, tempting black to try to attack it for profit. Instead you and black moved along the sequence beginning at o17, which, while rather disadvantageous for you, gives you the white group as it is right now. Basically, it's a tank.

What you've earned with that white group is the right to play elsewhere, because there is no longer the theat of black simultaneously attacking a weak white group in the middle and stones elsewhere (say, around r11)

So let's look at some of your options.

There are two main areas that are of concern: the right side and the left side. White's left side is theoretically bigger, since black does not have any living groups there, but it is unlikely that white will succeed in killing all of black's stones off. Black has a big area on the right,  but without a stone around r11 it's difficult for black to aggressively attack a move that seeks to make life in this territory.

The first option is to make sure that black doesn't secure his territory on the right by playing around r11. 

This lets black attack for profit, which is reasonable considering black's position, but it also probably ends in gote, so black ca play elsewhere.

As another option, let's look at c14...]
(;W[mh]C[All your groups are safe, so your next move should be a move that does something. What does n12 do? It sort of moves into your opponents territory, and in a very, very limited way it expands your own, but with big moves still on the board (as outlined with the last move) this is just too small.

The move is also uninspired. It slightly expands an already living group. It doesn't take much, and it doesn't put anything on the line. It looks to be the product of automatic, unthinking play. That sort of play happens - you're looking for the next move and you think "I'll just develop these stones in this direction" and there's coherent logic and narrative to it so you go with it.

But you missed the chance at a big move. And you moved along a line that led to black enclosing a huge area. This kind of problem is a common - and important - one for players at your level.

Here's what I like to do. Take some green paint and paint five of your white stones (the cheap ones!) green. When you review a game, play it out on a real board and throughout the game pause and find five possible moves for the next one, using your green stones for these five moves. Then, with all of them on the board, go from one move to the next and go through the pro and cons, comparing the moves and see if you can justify why one of them is the best.

This will do a couple things. Looking at the whole board and always comparing possible moves during play won't get you to find the absolute best move, but it will weed out the really slack moves. It will also give you a chance to work with and apply that strange go vocabulary - words like sente, gote, thick, weak, solid - which make sense of the game's complexities.]
;B[lg];W[lh]C[This is too direct. It's not vitally important that you keep your stone at n12 connected to the group, and either way, o11 does the same thing and then some. It would be just better to play around r11 and start a sequence like the one outlined earlier.]
;B[nh];W[ni];B[mg]C[Black gives white a pass. This move does very little.]
;W[ll]C[This begins a sequence that is really bad for white. 

Here is a place where it would have nice to read an account of your thoughts. Why did you move here? 

I suspect you were trying to make territory with this group, thinking that since the m9 stone is sitting there next to this strong group, you should capture it.

You end up with a couple points and black gets to wall off a huge territory, making it so that you need to throw a stone in there and roll the dice on it surviving.

A good rule is to never try to make territory with groups in the middle of the board.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[nk]
(;W[lj];B[nj];W[mj]C[What does this move bring you? If black moves to n10 it will threaten to take a single stone and start a ko, which is small even in the end game. Right now there are a number of places on the board that are bigger.]
;B[oi];W[mi];B[oh]C[This was a disaster for white. Black enclosed a huge space.]
;W[oj]C[This cut separates two living groups. It's not going to do much good, and it lets black clear up the aji around the cut. Better to just throw something into the vast open space of black's right side territory.]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[qk];W[qh];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[qj];B[ri];W[rh]
;B[rj];W[nl];B[mm]C[I wouldnt throw away stones like he does with the forcing move at p8.. If those 4 stones remain uncaptured they could come in handy somewhere down the line.

Have you ever heard of the term "aji keshi"? Aji is "bad taste," lingering weakness in stones that can be exploited or threatened later. Like that black group in the middle. It has a lot of aji.  Aji keshi is something that gets rid of an opponents aji by letting them solidify their position. The sequence starting with o8 is aji keshi. Those four stones are going to be captured, sure, but by encouraging black to capture them, you get rid of lingering aji around o8 and q13.

Think about the sente sequence following q13]
(;W[ol];B[pk]
(;W[re]C[S16 is better, and in general, that kind of move under the 4-4 stone is a good one to file away, since it is versatile and can take the corner or extend along the side]
;B[rc]C[Take a couple moments to look at this position on the top right. These three white stones should die. It is their fate. If they do live, it will only be by some mistake. 

This is a handy sense to have. As black in this situation, with some reckless invader trying to steal a clear win from you with a life or death problem, you know you have to play carefully and think through everything. White knows he shouldn't get away with this, but he also knows he just might be able to do it if he uses his play to make the situation more complicated and give black tough choices to make. 

On a similar note. Take a look at the group in the lower right. It may look like solid white territory, but later on black might throw in just to see if you make a mistake and let it be killed or turn it into a seki, sort of like how this white group lives even though it "shouldn't." Go is full of a lot of those moments, and many people pull out their hair and curse about bad sportsmanship when an opponent probes them for big careless mistakes at the end of what would otherwise be a decided game. I've come to like that sort of thing, though, and come to think of that kind of tenacity as a special one among the go virtues.]

(;W[ap];B[am];W[bp]C[White could have killed this group at a couple of points. This is frustrating and happens a lot, but it's also part of what makes go fun. We should think about what you can do to handle these situations better. If either this group or the bottom black group had not made life, you would have won easily (and if your group on the right had died it would have not been even close!). 

The easy advice is to say you should do a lot of life and death problems. This is true. Do a bunch of life and death problems! 

But I would add to that that you should 1) bring the speed of the game down to a snail's pace when these things happen, 2) never ever ever ever play a move hoping your opponent will make a clear mistake and 3) if you can't read something out, play solidly. The last of these is sneakily helpful advice. If you play solidly, it's a pretty good bet that your opponent, who can't read out the situation either, will make a mistake and you will be a good position to capitalize on it.]
;B[cj]
(;W[dk];B[ci];W[bj]C[Again white charitably throws away a couple stones to strengthen black's position. There is some kind of sloppy or unreasonable thinking behind these moves, since I am confident you can read out black's proper response. Figure out what impulse it is that leads you to this and similar moves and root it out. I think I mentioned this before, but typically this sort of thing is either hoping the opponent will make a mistake or just playing too quickly.

So something like this happens. You see a possible move. You ask yourself how your opponent would respond, and you get the sense it's not going to work. That's step one. It's a good place to start, actually. The problem is, for step 2 you say, "lets try it anyway, maybe it will work." It's no surprise but a little bit of a disappointment when it doesn't. Anyway, what you need is a better step 2, a kind of go-to line of thinking that isn't just "find another move."

So here's a trick: when you find a move that doesn't quite work, instead of just trying it out anyway, search for a move that has a similar follow up move. So here, for instance, you aren't going to kill this group. That chance has passed. But some moves in the area are now sente because they threaten the group with a follow up move. B12 is such a move. It won't kill black, but it will threaten it's second eye of black ignores it. That doesn't mean you should play it now (it's not clear if the exchange that would follow is particularly advantageous), but it's a good one to file away to think about as the game progresses.

An even better example is the cut starting with h14. The cut doesn't work, but there are a number of moves that make it so that cut would work (g14, for instance). These moves might come in handy if they can serve a dual purpose at some point, since black has to respond to them by protecting against the cut.]
;B[bi];W[aj];B[ai];W[dh];B[ch];W[fc]C[I think you didn't realize the strength of your position here. Black really needs to save this group. White should cut those stones at f16 and fight like crazy. Something good should come out of it.]

(;W[cf]C[I really like this move. It's a question of justice. Black left some awkward, weak groups here and it would be a kind of moral hazard if you let him get away with it and solve his problems elegantly with a move on the top left. 

 These stones on the top left and middle should struggle. Just look at the funny shape of the group in the middle, and the way white's h17 stone sits right below black's h15 stone, lurking around the gap between the center group and its savior, the 4-4 stone. A move at f16 could provoke a challenging fight.

Also, this move makes use of the strength of white's middle group, and c14 is a good extension from the group on the right side after white descends at c8.

Could black respond by pulling the left side black group out with a move at b9 or by solidifying the right side with a move around q11? Yes, but it's quite risky. My best assessment of the situation says c11 is sente.]

The response to the low approach on the 4-4 stonw with p17 is something you see a lot of as a dd kyu, and even later. It's very simple, and the beginning player feels like they have come out on top because it looks like black has more territory than he in fact has. It's handy to remember that this is suboptimal, because white can jump into the corner at r17.]

4th line territory is gold. Take it when given to you. Sure, black gets a bunch of influence. But especially as a double digit kyu it's tough to know what to so with that. Black is giving white money in the bank - and lots of it - white shouldn't get greedy and ask for more.]
