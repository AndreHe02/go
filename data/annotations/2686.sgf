AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi Adam,

I don't know your rating so I wasn't entirely sure that I could comment meaningfully about this game. Since it has been sent to me, I have to assume that its ok. Please remember that I am a 3k* on IGS only, no professional, but I will try to comment as best as I am able.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[mc]C[White does well to tenuki a lot in handicap games like this.]
;B[pf]C[Black should also make a two line extension.];W[fc]
;B[df]C[White's top stones are six lines apart , which is not ideal (5 is best).]
;W[lq]C[Does the opening look normal so far?

More or less.]
(;B[mq]C[This is painful for black, indicating that these high one space extensions are not correct. Black would like to pincer here, but white can gut him with O2.

See diagram.];W[iq]C[Or should I have defended at M4?

No this is correct. B at J3 would have made things difficult for black.]
;B[qj]C[This B attack is timid and poorly timed. White can gain eyespace with S3 and continue as in the game. See diagram.]

(;W[on]C[Is this okay or was ie S9 or Q9 prefered?

That kind of contact move strengthens Black. This is Ok, but eyespace is needed as shown previously.]
;B[nn];W[pk]C[Black's move is too tight. White should be patient and extend to P7, not attack R10 right away.]
;B[ql];W[qk];B[rk];W[rj]C[White got lucky here. What about this other continuation?]

(;B[ri];W[rl];B[sj];W[rm]C[Was this okay?];B[rq];W[qo]C[Too small. White needs to move out.]
;B[cj]C[A general big move but too ambiguous. Black should seal his corner at Q17 or his other corner at E3. Both of these also pressure white's stones.]
;W[jd]C[You see now why 6 is bad. Black can still attack at H17.]
;B[pc]C[This move no longer threatens white, so E3 or E17 is better.]

(;W[ch]C[Is this a good invasion point?

Yes, but better to come in at D18 first. See diagram.];B[cg]
C[Again because of high stones, Black must answer timidly.]
;W[di];B[dc]C[B should have connected underneath at B12. This strengthens the side. W should have formed Iron pillar at D12 instead of diagonal.]
;W[cq]C[This was well timed by W.];B[cp];W[dq];B[fp]C[Black should have helped C10]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dk];B[cm];W[ck];B[kq]C[A terrible result for B.]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[kp];W[lp];B[ip];W[hp]C[More bad moves by B]
;B[io];W[ho];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr];W[js];B[lo];W[ko];B[jo];W[jp]
;B[kn];W[kp]C[Probably not neccesary....

Very necessary. L4 completely hardens the Black group. This keeps black off balance with cutting points.]
;B[mo];W[nm];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk];W[mj];B[lj]C[Was it ok to have black form this kind of wall?

No.  What was white trying to achieve here? To help the right side white group? White was quite alive before this sequence. The territory gained was negligible.]
;W[el];B[dm];W[fo]
(;B[eo]C[Black needs to make a base here. See diagram for a better way.]
;W[gp];B[ep];W[eq]C[Probably F6 better here?];B[fn];W[in]C[6 points in Gote is too small. W needs something bigger like g15 or B12. B should ignore J6 and attack at H17 or gut white at B12.]
;B[jn];W[im];B[jm];W[li];B[il];W[gn];B[fm];W[gm];B[fl];W[fk]
;B[gl]C[Didnt manage to connect now...

Left side white group would be better off moving out than trying to connect. B12 is very big and helps this group too.]
;W[oe]C[This peep helps black. See diagram.]
(;B[nc];W[nd];B[od]C[O18 far better];W[me];B[hc];W[hd]
(;B[jc];W[kc];B[jb]C[Is blacks invasion stoppable? Or was it few moves ago?

Actually, this result is quite mild compared to what might have happened. See diagram.]

;W[qf];B[qg];W[qd];B[re];W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[nh];B[oi]
;W[oj];B[pj]C[Black needs to get into white's framework. This is all too small. Same for white to expand his framework.]
;W[ok];B[ni];W[mi];B[ki];W[kh];B[jh];W[ji];B[kj];W[kg];B[jg]
;W[ii];B[hg]TR[jg][jh]C[Are those black stones stoppable?

No.  White should have ataried at K13.];W[ff];B[hi];W[jf];B[ih]
C[H12 better shape];W[gi];B[hj]C[Where did it go wrong :S

Atari at K14.];W[gg];B[if];W[je];B[fd];W[fe];B[ed];W[gh];B[hh]
;W[eg];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj];W[bk];B[ag]C[This sequence works well for black. A13 is unnecessary and thus the sequence should end in sente.]
;W[pa]
(;B[qb]C[Of course, R17 is the correct move here. B still loses the corner, but saves his stones.]

C[Hane at T3 is biggest move now, I think.];W[dg];B[ee];W[cf]
;B[bg];W[bf]TR[ag][bg][cg][bh][bi]C[Marked group is not killable, is it?

No, but I think white profited from the sacrifice.];B[ce];W[ai]

(;W[mb]C[N18 is unnecessary.];B[hm];W[hn];B[hl];W[ef];B[de]
C[How was the endgame?

Hane and connection like T3 are worth 6 pts. in sente. Don't neglect them!]
