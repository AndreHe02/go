C[samourai [5k\]: hi

i have add many variations for questions but only the line of the game is 
very important, not necesary to comment the variations if you are not enough 
time.

let's go !!

hi i'm ake7440 this is my first review so it may have some 
mistake.];B[pd];W[cp];B[qp]LB[dc:B][oq:A]C[kkawakatsu [5k\]: hi]

(;W[oq]C[i choose this for stop black to make shimari and take advantages on 
the opposite komokus, it is better to take the last corner ?

u can play like u want. but take last corner will make simple 
game];B[dc];W[ce]C[because of the influence of the hoshi and on my others 
low positions, it is better to make a high approach move to concurrence 
black's influence ?

in my taste high is better and simplier.];B[ee]C[is it a proper move for 
black ?

yes. it attack and make 
influence];W[dd];B[ed];W[cc];B[eb];W[ch];B[ep];W[eq]C[not good. this joseki 
will help black to attack your p3. attack this approach is better.]
;B[fq];W[dq];B[gp]LB[do:A][kq:B][lq:C]C[with A i think i have chosen the 
wrong joseki for take advantage of the opposites komokus because of the 
pincer-extension at B for black, perhaps is it possible to play at B or C 
here for me ? or E3 before is it a wrong choice ?

A is not good enough cause black still invade easily. B is very bad. it will 
make many weak group. black will attack it and take the profit from attack. 
C is simply but i think the best for your choice. After C black is quite 
leader position.]
(;W[do];B[kq];W[qq];B[rq];W[pp];B[qr]C[help white to 
leave.];W[qo];B[pq];W[rp]C[not good. make sabaki now is the most 
importance.];B[qq];W[oo];B[ro]C[bad move. really small. must peep white at 
q6 and o4 then white group will be fall in attack.];W[rn];B[sp]
;W[qn]C[good.];B[mq]C[very small again.];W[qf]C[good move. this 
is correct direction, but i prefer high approach again.];B[of]
C[proper move 
?
how to counter the formation of this influence and is it better to destroy 
his influence or to make my own border ?

play simply. there are still many point to invade in the upper.]
;W[qi]C[may 
be it too flat. i prefer q12.];B[oi];W[pk]C[quite small. there r some better 
point such as invade at the upper or extet your influence at your left 
side.];B[qe];W[fc];B[ec];W[kc]C[my ideas here is to make aji and heavy black shape with 
F17 and make a foothold in the top border (miais H17 and O17)

agree];B[pf];W[nc]C[good];B[pc];W[hc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb];W[cl]

no. this make room and still treat to cut at e14]
