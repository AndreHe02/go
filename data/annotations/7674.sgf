C[krv: I have try to use many faces of go when doing this review. It can give some useful hints on my playing level - I can miss som tesuji or possibilities. I think that I play some stronger but my attention can be weak and thus it helps very much.]

;B[ci];W[qj];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[ck]C[I did not know how to respond to this.

krv: I think this invasion is slightly inadequate. I like your move - but MFG suggests D10 instead.]

(;B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]C[I know white's position in the lower right has a weakness, but I do not know how to utilize it.]
;B[qf]C[I tried to squeeze white...

krv: Wrong position. R13 is better - any case there is plenty room to invade into corner - but it's slightly harder to live for white on this side.]

It loses sente and is unnecessary, I think.
