;B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[jc]C[you said san ren sei -- but that would be to play at D10.]
;W[cj];B[qf]C[a mistake in direction white should pincer taking an extension and a pincer all in one moves]
;W[mc];B[qj]C[ok, but this low position is not the best perhaps.  I like Q11 here -- it leaves fewer weaknesses, is more flexible, and looks to the center more.  the three point jump invites splitting so it is almost inherently gotes]
;W[rd];B[ph]C[notice how little you got for your three stones compared to w's three stones. and you are still vulnerable underneath]
;W[fq]C[well timed and right direction for w since a play on the left side is miai for w after a bl approach]
;B[cm]C[too far  if w approaches on point away, extend one point away. too loose -- just like in the upper right]
;W[cq]C[you can't cut this off, now without a nasty fight and you are outnumbered so you need to simply play C4 -- which you intended to do with the extension you made the move before or else it was really wrong]
;B[dq]C[oops.  w should trade now, taking the corner and leaving you with a group in the center]
;W[dr];B[cp];W[br]C[ok, w played quietly -- a mistake to give up sente here, but w has potential on the lower side now]
;B[cg]C[this is the best move yet, probably.  extend and pincer the white stone.  you are, of course, loose in the corner ant at the top -- but should come out ok -- this move makes sense of the lower corner for black]
;W[dc]C[Is this move ok?

W does not want to give B the uncontested corner, so this probe is well timed.  the left side stone has lots of choices yet]
;B[cc]C[hane as played is probably right, if you can handle the cross-cut]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[fc];B[fd]C[yes w is playing this horribly wrong -- must start with the crosscut or the counter hane at either c18 or e16.  but w is daring you to prove that you know how to use the strength w is giving you -- and most pre-2k players don't.]
;W[gd]C[This feels terrible.  Is white playing this wrong?]
;B[ge];W[hc];B[dk]C[good-- drive w toward your strenght.  though I like the one point cap here better]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[he];B[gf]C[notice how w is squeezing you -- see how the one point cap would have been bigger?  also, 33 needs to be at H14 -- counter hane]
;W[cb];B[bc]C[no -- ignore w 34 -- it is small endgame stuff -- w is already alive and so are you
work on the lower right corner or pulling out the stone on K17]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[ei];B[di];W[hj]C[40 plays with the top and bottom white stones]
;B[kq]C[I'm sorry but my program doesn't show "A".  B should approach from the right side around Q6]
;W[iq]C[In hindsight, I think I should have moved at "A".  What do you think?]
;B[nq];W[qm]C[W has played a stone too far here.  the one-point jump is right]
;B[pr]C[the slide is ok, but the 3-3 invation because of w's over play is invithing as is a cap at p7]
;W[qq];B[je];W[hf];B[jg];W[hg];B[id]C[ok, but small and burns a useful move that may help later  look at N15 -- the cap -- andhow it threatens the W group in the corner and creates the potential for something bigger in the center for b -- especially if B can cap at P7]
;W[hd];B[me];W[nd];B[ne]C[wrong -- leavet it -- too small now -- go to P& or maybe P8 if you are timid here]
;W[oe];B[nh]C[ouch.  the losing move  I don't see how B can recover now absent a big mistake by w.  Just too small.  NOtice how crowded your stone are compared to W.]
;W[qr];B[jr]C[No.  To the center man, to the Center.];W[ir]
;B[nr]C[A second wasted move.  To make a group you are concerned about ok, run away to friends in the center.  The two point jump at O6 or anything around there is vastly superior.  This is too small.  at least play the pull back here -- P2 or maybe P3]
;W[eg];B[df]C[painful, no?  Your wall has now become a heavy useless clump of stones gaining no points at all either there or elsewhere.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[dh];B[ch];W[ao];B[bn];W[og];B[oh];W[ng];B[mg]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[ko];B[fo];W[lo]C[which is bigger for b 77 or 78? or K10 or P8 or any number of larger-scale moves.]
;B[lr];W[io]C[I was worried about the cut here, but I think this is where I really lost the game.]
;B[rl]C[Black makes great use of the sente.];W[rm];B[rf];W[mh]
;B[lh];W[mi];B[mf];W[li];B[kh];W[ql];B[kk];W[mk];B[ki];W[lk]
;B[of];W[pf]C[Of course this is awful.];B[pg];W[rk];B[rj];W[mp]
;B[np];W[no];B[op];W[oo];B[ok];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk];B[pl];W[om]
;B[qk];W[pm];B[sk];W[kl];B[sm]C[I'm not going to comment on this fight.  Lots of mistakes, but the main thing  you need to do to improve is think a bit bigger -- run to the center, learn to use  your influence to attack.  don't let stones get cut apart, but play bigger.  W made lots of errors in this fight too.

Get a book on fighting -- like "Get Strong at Invading" and read through professional games or high-level amateur games to see how they fight.
