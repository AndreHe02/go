C[I've win this match. Im changing my way of playing. Usually I tend to make many weak groups invading his territory. Now I've made moyo.

Im not used to this way of playing and Im sure IÂ´ve made many errors.

[kb\]: Hi, my comments are marked with [kb\]];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[fq];W[cn]C[[kb\]: This is fine, although if you want to play a moyo game, D6 ikken tobi is the move.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[nc];B[lc]C[I dont know in wich cases is good to play r17 or o15. Now I've played o16, but was good?

[kb\]: Generally, O15 ikken tobi is considered to be slightly worse for White - it gives Black too much territory on the side for not much compensation.  R17 would be fine here - Black doesn't have a good way to block.]

(;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd]C[I dont like this joseki. I usually loose when I play this. I dont know when is time to play it or not.

[kb\]: ...then don't play it!];B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hc]
;W[ge]C[Acordin to The many Faces of Go's  Joseki dictionary I should have played M16, but I dont see the purpose of this move and its continuation. G14 aim to make moyo in the left side, and I can still invede r17 corner. I dont know if this general idea is good.

[kb\]: You are fine with omitting M16.  Black here should probably defend with G17, but he also wants to play around E6/F6 to limit the White moyo (or wedge with C11).]
;B[ec];W[dc]C[[kb\]: White says, 'Thank you!'];B[ed];W[ee];B[eb]
;W[df]C[Or d15? I thought is was good to be a little closer to c6

[kb\]: I have never seen this pattern before, but D14 looks good.]
;B[qj]C[I think he should invade at D10 because my future moy is greater than his one.

[kb\]: I agree completely.];W[dj]C[[kb\]: Great move.];B[ch]
;W[ci]C[Or C10? First I thought that C11 would help his sabaki, but C10 let him more space to make eyes]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[be]
(;W[bf]C[[kb\]: What about connecting?];B[cb];W[de]C[He'll  live in the cornerbut I assure my moyo in sente]
;B[cc]
(;W[jj]C[Consistent with my general strategy of making moyo. O5 is bad now because will help him invade the moyo

[kb\]: Here's a useful exchange you can remember.];B[md];W[le]
C[Maybe it was time to r17 because m15 is not big and black o16 is big

[kb\]: Yes!];B[me];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]
;B[rf];W[qe];B[qf];W[qd];B[nf]
(;W[nq]C[I think is bigger than f5, and my invasion will be greather than his reduction of my moyo

[kb\]: Or you can keep building your moyo...  Probes on the right side would also probably be useful.]
;B[no]C[[kb\]: This is a sharp move - this is why you want to probe the right side first.]
;W[qq]C[O3 should't scape because it would cause a reduction of my moyo]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op]
(;W[oq]C[Better at N2];B[lf];W[kf]C[I think M10 is better because I reduce his moyo more than he does with mine

[kb\]: This is probably necessary.]
(;B[lg]C[[kb\]: I think Black could have played double hane.]

;B[lq]C[I dint know if that way of closing moyos has been optimal. I have more territory but Could I have done it better?

[kb\]: I wouldn't complain at all.  You are winning - and you got off easy on the bottom right corner of your moyo]
