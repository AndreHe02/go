TM[2700]KM[0.500000]HA[2];W[qp];B[dd];W[qf]C[Here  black have several options how to mess with white. One thing  that black DON'T want is to let white live on the right side without a fight.  Instead, lets see what black can do with building walls.]

(;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qj]C[This it should be obvious now that the attach-and-extend  joseki is  not to prefere here since white gets a stabile group and no worries. Now to  make the best out of the situation, black should consider k16, or k15 as an  extension.]
;B[md]C[This is to narrow. remember that if you don't understand  how the  joseki works on the table, using it may prove to be more of a burden than a  asset.]
;W[fd]C[Now white will attack the left in order to reduce the right.  Pincer  is the only thing here.]
;B[hd]C[good. Now white must either escape or get a  base. I allways prefer  escaping. It's a tougher path but more fun. ;)]
;W[dc]C[White sneaking under  to try to get a base.];B[cc];W[ec];B[ce]C
[I'd prefere d15.  Simpler, neater  and more attacking.];W[cb];B[bb]C[Overplay. Just waiting to be cut. play  simpler, like b17 and you will  win many nights of good sleep. =)]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[ac];B[ad];W[cd];B[bf]C[Now  white has secured a good base on the upper side, gotten a few  rather nice ko threats and black have about nuthing.]
;W[cc];B[op]C[This point  is very big. It should have been played earlier in the  game. Perhaps if n16 would have been played at k16 instead, the h16 would not  be needed and you could have played at p4 instead. Though you got this point  anyway =) Now lets see how you use it.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[oo]L[mp]C[The standard continuation of the joseki is a, which makes white  sliding under gote. now it's sente for white.]
;W[nr];B[mq];W[qn];B[om]C[This  is not really sente. White could play elsewhere.]
;W[pl];B[mr]C[this is  neither sente. White should ignore this. Now we basically  have the same situation as in the upper side with a big black wall on the  right side and a lonely stone on the left. guess where white will attack =)]
;W[fq];B[hq]C[Pincer is still good. Now it's the low one spaced pincer which  is a  good one. As in the upper right corner, what black wants is for white to jump  into the corner.]
;W[cq]C[White plays along nicely. Now the obvious move is  c4, NOT d3. D3 is  VERY bad. Ok. one could argue that it plays well with the left group but lets  compare the difference with the two plays.]

(;B[dq];W[cp];B[cr]C[Excuse me,  but this is awfull. =) You let white destroy your left  side completely and you will get one stone for your worries =)]
;W[br];B[er]C[NONONONONO! What is so horrible with white taking one lousy stone at  c2? compared with him running upwards the left side? One stone is 2 points.  Running up the left side is 20-30 points per move! (Perhaps not exact  calculations, but at least to demonstrate the graveness of the move)]
;W[cs]C[This is a feeble move from white. it's jose moves! Should not be  played until the endgame. =)]
;B[dr];W[co];B[do];W[cn];B[ci]C[Again a bit to  narrow extension to work. The question though is if  any extension would work well here. d6 is a huge move now for white since it  forces black to try to save his group. White have nicely lost the preassure  on his groups and can concentrate on pressing blacks group.]
;W[dn];B[fo];W[ho]C[interesting move. Not sure it will work though.];B[gp]
C[This is a bad  respons. You should have cutten white into two with f6.  If white runs with h7 black runs along. White will be forced to run to the  left side or live in the middle.]
;W[jo]C[White building a little "base" to  run from i suspect.];B[lo];W
[iq]C[White trying to live here? To much work.  Should play easy since he's  got the upper hand right now  =)]
;B[ir]C[This is to weak! You should punish  white for trying to live inside  two black walls.]
;W[jq];B[jr]C[Don't answer such a move! k2 is no threat  anyway since you can block  at h2]
;W[hp];B[fn]C[Now white have gotten a good base for extending into the   middle.]
;W[jd]C[Great pincer. It can actually run into the middle if black  sneaks  under it.]
;B[gf]C[black running? It's something like running from your  fortress when  you outarm the enemy. You should use your thickness to attack. l17, k14 or  something. (k14 actually aims at the lower-middle white group)]
;W[hc];B[kc];W[ic];B[cl];W[ff];B[ee]C[this is what my friend and teacher Zoltan would  describe as a thank-
you-very-much move. You waste one attacking move to help white reinforce his  position.]
;W[fe];B[gg]C[Building wall is pretty nice in this area. just  remember to  elliminate bad aji before it becomes to late.]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[jb]C[This is  perhaps a thankyouverymuch move from white =)]
;B[kb];W[fh];B[gj]C[Now you  enclose the white group so he is forced to move. This is  good. Just beware so that the upper or right side holes don't coime crashing  in.]
;W[il];B[gl]C[Not needed. You should close the REAL holes before you  close that  one.]
;W[og];B[nf];W[kl];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq];W[bm];B[bl];W[fi]C[White now have  at least one eye secured. It looks like he might live  in here.]
;B[gi];W[ol];B[ng];W[oi];B[ni]C[To bad it is to late to contain him  now. I would like to draw both  players attention to the fact that what black have against him now is  mistakes done 30-40 moves ago. That is a very common fact in Go.]
;W[nj];B[mj];W[nh];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[lh]C[Overplay. White must have misread.]
;B[ni];W[rd];B[oh];W[ph];B[oj];W[rc];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj]C[Black was given the chance  to severly reduce whites territory. But  the q10 play should not have been played since s17 is a very big move. Black  must block s17 now.]
;W[pb]C[p18 works too.];B[nb];W[jj];B[jc];W[id];B[ib]C[This sequence ends in blacks gote. (which in this case is bad)]

;W[hh];B[se];W[re];B[tt];W[ge];B[fl];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt];C[Summary:  I've neglected to comment on the endgame since the endgame  was so controlled by how the players played in the opening. I've just tried  to point out larger mistakes in the endgame. Both players should think of  what they want to do with their stones. You don't throw stones on the board  randomly, you must have a plan when you place the stone, otherwise you could  just aswell pass. I would like to apologize if i sounded to harsh but it  allways works for me when someone yells a little. (And boy have i heard a lot  of yelling =).]
)
(;B[cp];W[dq];B[fp];W[fr];B[gp]C[Now black basically have  thick walls all around the middle which  makes invasions so much cumbersome. The idea is to let white invade but make  him live small and confined.]
))
(;B[pi]L[ph][qh][qi]C[This is  the 2-space high pincer. What black wishes is for white to  jump into the corner so black can build a black wall on the outside and  confining white to the corner. Black have several other options also, marked  a, b and c.]

(;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pf];W[rf];B[pg]C[This is a very nice  development for black, building a great wall on  the outside. The q15 point is a weakness for both players but is to early to  be played yet.]
)
(;W[of]C[Another popular pattern is to jump out. but with  the 2 space high  pincer at q11, this is difficult.]
;B[nd];W[mf];B[ql]C[White have no base and  must secure his group first. Black is quite  secure in both areas, none of his groups are weak. Black gains from this  since he takes cash, while white only gets potential, if even that.]
