C[I was playing this game in a server. I have started playing Go only 3 weeks ago and I believe some plays I did is consedered useless. I'm black.]
;B[gc];W[gf];B[cd];W[dg]C[I think I neew to study some josekis

PNH: That's not really necessary. Playing on boards
smaller than 19x19 is useful to sharpen you tactical
skills. The study of josekis goes hand in hand with
the study of strategy and opennings. And strategies
are very different for different sized boards.];B[ee];W[fd]
;B[fe]TR[fd]C[would it be better if I played E7 instead?

PNH: E7 seems good also since it protects upper territory.
But your move threatens to cut and capture the F6 stone
which is also good.];W[ge];B[gd]C[PNH: Excellent.];W[ec];B[ed]
TR[fb][ed]C[I think here it would be better if W F7
White group would die faster

PNH: Here I would first play on the marked spot (F8)
to narrow withe's base on the top side. If you don't do
this the continuation is dangerous for you, as I will
indicate shortly...];W[fc];B[dc];W[gb]C[PNH: Now what can you do?]
;B[fa]TR[gc][gd]C[PNH: It is seldom good to play on the borders. Your two
stones on the right are doomed.]
(;W[eb];B[hb];W[id]C[PNH: This is also bad];B[ga];W[hc];B[fb]
;W[hd];B[gb];W[db];B[cb];W[bf];B[be]TR[eg]C[What would be better than B5?

PNH: B5 seems to ensure victory with a reasonable
margin because of your large number of prisonners.
And you can still squeeze white's bottom territory. So B5
was a good choice.

E3 seems possible, also, to invade the bottom side right
away but it might not be as good as your actual move (B5)]
(;W[ef]C[Is there any good for white by plsyinh B8 instead?

PNH: That would be suicide. Check variation.];B[ff]C[I think D4 would be better

PNH: I am insure. They both seem good.];W[de];B[dd];W[fg];B[ce]
;W[cf]C[A ko fight would bring problens if W J8

PNH: Yes.];B[af];W[ag];B[ae];W[bh];B[ib];W[df];B[ic];W[hf]C[PNH: You played pretty well. Only your F9 move seemed
really useless. I think you are ready for 19x19 games,
although you can still pursue 9x9 games if you enjoy
them. Be aware that you can pick up bad habits though.
The playing style is much more influence oriented on
larger boards.

Read about basic openning strategies (19x19) and save
the study of joseki for much later. That's an advice that all
strong players give.

You will get more from reviews of your 19x19 games also.
Tactical play you can figure out a lot by yourself.

Have fun!])
(;W[bb];B[bc]TR[bb]C[PNH: Now white has no continuation in the upper left corner.
His stone is as good as captured.]))
(;W[hc]C[PNH: This would have been wiser for white.];B[hd];W[he]
