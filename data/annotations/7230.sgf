AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[So, my name is Aaron, and I'm playing White in this game.  I'm pretty sure that Black is much stronger than the five stone handicap I gave him; he didn't really

I'm interested mostly in the following:

* how to do a better job in handicap fuseki
* how to better fight back against a large-ish handicap.
* and, of course, anywhere in particular I've really screwed up. :-)

I've inserted some questions at points where things were...wierd in the game.  Thanks much for the review!

ufo: Hi, I'm your reviewer. Unfortunately, I pretty much suck at handicap games. I will try to pass what little I know.]

(;W[le]C[(afox) This seems to me, at second glance, to be too small. Perhaps a kakari in the lower left or right corners instead?

ufo: If W would make the area at the top in sente, I wouldn't say this is to small, because it would make the two weak groups strong, as well as taking points. It means that W can play agressive in the future, since his group is strong. Technically, I think this move is weak though.
Of course, handicap games are bluf for a part, but black can quite easily exploit the weakness in your stones to get points. See var.]
;B[ke];W[kd]C[ufo: A lot of complex variations are possible, and I couldn't possibly tell you what would have been the best line for both players. I think the variation on the next black move bears more potential than the one played.]

[ne:6][kf:E][lf:F][pf:G]C[(afox) So, I'm really not happy with this sequence. White comes out with sente, but, well, it just feels cluttered. Any suggestions?

ufo: Go is all about life and death. In this position there are no weak groups. White has 1 pretty stable group, which has already made points and has sente. 

Next, and definitely less important, in a handicap game we could also evaluate efficiency because you start with about fifty points behind. 

If we compare the efficiency of the marked 14 stones (including the prisoner), I would happily say that white has already gained points. The black stones (except for G) are especially inefficient, so I would be happy with this sequence. With some luck the heavy black group could even become weak later in the game.]
;W[hd]TR[jp]C[(afox) I realize that this move is sub-optimal. If black peeps, white can still make life in the corner. Plus, it pissed away sente. Bad move methinks...

ufo: I agree. This is where you have to bluff in a handicap game. I'm sure a pro player would have abused you badly for the invasion point in the upper side, but when a weaker player invades, you can often use the extra weak group to create strength al round and gain many points. I think it is interesting in letting a weaker player invade, after careful consideration. Here indeed the corner is still open, the group in the top is strong, etc...

Eg, there is a proverb that says play away from thickness. For black's next move, taking that proverb to heart would mean that the marked point would be an excellent move instead of invading at this point, so your move is to slow. White should probably kakari.]
;B[hf]C[ufo: This is yet another inbalanced move. You get your sente back.]
;W[jq];B[nq];W[fq];B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[qh];B[qj]
(;W[oh]C[(afox) could a pincer have worked better here?

ufo: maybe yes because if you attack the stone in the middle, and you jump out later black would not be so tempted to play the severe move at O14. On the other hand, if the black stone in the middle jumps out it is safe almost immediately. I have similar problems playing against high handicap.]
;B[nf]
(;W[rf];B[rd];W[pk]C[(afox) So, right or wrong, I REALLY like the shape here. :-)

ufo: I would say it depends on what you want. The shape resembles this joseki: http://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointLowApproachOneSpaceLowPincerOnePointJump

Usually B will get a group on the third line, and you will get a wall. Here a wall would face a reasonably strong center position of black, so it might be dubious. Splitting the group on the bottom right corner from the marked stone might bear more potential, but as that stone can jump out easily towards the tengen stone, and the bottom isn't that weak I'm unsure if it would really be better.]
;B[qk];W[pl]
(;B[lp]C[ufo: Bad time to leave the battlefield I think.]
(;W[lr];B[qm]C[ufo: If two, extend, if three, jump out. Like in the variations.]
;W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[rn];W[rk];B[sm];W[rj];B[pi]
(;W[qi]C[ufo: this is to small. These two stones are worth 4 points and you gain a low group which does not have enough influence over the rest of the bord.]
;B[ph];W[pj];B[oi];W[nr];B[or];W[mq];B[np];W[dj];B[ci];W[cj]
C[(afox) I think this was a mistake. Too slow?

ufo: It was black's mistake. One shouldn't approach a stone on the fourth line diagonally like that. Now the white stones are much stronger. 3 liberties against 5.]
;B[bj];W[cl];B[em];W[bk];B[bi];W[bm];B[bn];W[di];B[dh];W[fo]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[fd]
(;W[gd];B[ec]C[(afox) I think this was the turning point. Made attacking the corner very difficult for white. I'm behind on territory, and don't have a good corner position to make it up in the center.]
;W[dm];B[dn];W[el];B[cm];W[fm];B[en];W[gl];B[gn];W[fn];B[io]

(;W[br]C[(afox) I think I misread this. Too far in?

ufo: Yes, you can't jump from this position. B C2 is sente. you have to answer E2.

As a tsumego, this is no easy one, but i would think it is a seki in double sente, making it a good very big endgame.  See var.]
;B[cr];W[bq]
(;B[bp]C[ufo: Yet, this is a handicap game, and weaker players make mistakes reading out... This allows you to kill them all.]
;W[cs];B[er]TR[dq]C[ufo: B can no longer afford this because of the atari. If the two stones are captured, W has a living group in the corner, and otherwise they connect and B has a dead group either way.]

(;W[eq];B[bs];W[fr];B[dq];W[es];B[ds];W[er]
(;B[cs]
(;W[hn]C[ufo: Here W seems to get demoralised. What does this do? Threaten to capture 1 stone? This is probably the losing move.

ufo: I show some of the possible endgame moves in the variations.]
;B[ho];W[go];B[hq];W[jn];B[jo]C[ufo: Black takes the oppportunity with both hands to attack the W group at the bottom.]

(;C[Result: B+Resign

(afox) So, at this point, I read myself as at least 20 stones behind, and can't see an obvious place to make it up. Black's made some mistakes, but nothing I can really, really take advantage of. I toyed with continuing and using the aji from the bottom stones, but wasn't happy with the result (see variation).

Questions:

1) Where did I lose this game?
ufo: I think you only started losing completely in the end. Don't let your emotions take over. After some actions has gone pear-shaped, sit back, take your time to re-evaluate the position, and all your options. Don't try to capture 1 stone.

2) Did I resign too early? Am I missing something?
ufo: Yes, I think the group in the bottom can live, albeit in gote. There is a fair chance B makes some mistake that lets you of the hook for losing sente. Considering the the possibilities shown at move 95, I definitely think there was potential left for winning the game.

Conclusions:
1) In a handicap game, the opponents handicap (being a weaker player) lasts until the end of the game. Don't give up prematurely. Their concentration will suffer, they will blunder all the way to the end, so you can gain many points in the endgame. 
2) Reading out better than your opponent is a must in a Handicap game.]
