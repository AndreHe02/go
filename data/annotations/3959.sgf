C[First of all thank you very much for taking the time to review this game.

    I have a tendency towards playing fast games, usually 1/5.  I chose a slower game this time 10/10.  My oponent is one that I am familiar with, his agressiveness has given me trouble in the past.  He came out playing this game as aggressively as ever.  I focused on making real profit while pressuring his stones, rather than trying to kill them as has been my habit in the past.  This and eyeing connectivity are what I am trying to improve upon now.

I played an opening that I have seen played very successfuly, but have never tried.  Perhaps comment upon my effectiveness or lack thereof using it.  My sense of full board position as it relates to the size of moves and sente/gote are weak, I would appreciate comments in that direction, and anything else that I might miss.   I am quite open to brutal criticism, call a stupid move a stupid move if you wish, my ego can take it, I play go to get better.

Here we go...   oh, I played black.];B[pc];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
;B[pj];W[dj]C[In the Gobase.org repository I could find this whole board pattern only once and then black played...

On a search of the black pattern only I got 6 hits, the last pro to play this fuseki was Hashimoto Shoji (with white) against Cho Chikun in 1980. White lost. It doesn't seem to be such a commonly played fuseki.
Cho's fuseki was a very basic one (see variation)]

At this point white is about 40 points ahead... Serious work to be done.

I feel like I get sucked into fights with aggressive players and lose sight of the profit to be had.  any help would be much appreciated.  I know that even basic theoretical principles are out there that I might apply that will still make my game stronger.

Thank you once again and good Going.

When you look at board you see that white has almost all the left side of the board except for one area where he let you walk in. 

Black has no comparable territory on the sides of the board and has to compensate with territory in the center.

It's alot easier (because you need less stones!) to make territory on the sides of the board then in the center. You need to have access to the center in order to have a good base to invade from.

Play basic! Look for the biggest point on the board. Create healthy (living) groups. Attack when your opponents groups are not healthy. Try to read at least 2 moves ahead and try to time better (keep sente!).

Good luck! If you have any questions feel free to mail: navlot@bezeqint.net]
