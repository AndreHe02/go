AB[ic][ci]C[S. 

Hello there Ian,

My name is Simon, I am a KGS 7 kyu and I'll be doing a review of your game today. :)

Normally I wouldnt review a game like this because its best for you to submit games you lost against real players instead of the computer.

The reason why losing against real players is important is because the AI often makes "non sensical" moves which players wouldnt play, furthermore if you lose the game then I will have more mistakes to correct. If you win the game then my review will not have as much use.

Because of this, its preferable to switch to playing players on the 19x19 board almost asap. Maybe you want to get the feel of a 13x13 board but dont try to become 9p or anything on these boards. :P Its just to help you get the feeling for the game.

However, since you commented on every single move I figure that I can direct your thinking and help you improve your game. Encourage you in places here you have the right idea and maybe reallign your ideas if they are a little "wayward"...

Let's get started. :D]PL[W];W[dc];B[hi]C[Move 2: I'm pretty unfamiliar with opening moves, but I've heard that playing on H3 followed by J5 can be a good opener. An enclosure is what I've read it called.

S.

On smaller boards there isnt really such a thing as an opening move. I mean there is but its not the same as the 19x19 board. 

This is an example of things you will not be able to focus on as much until you move up to the full board.

So for now, don't worry about it.

However, the 3-4 point is a very important point to know and im glad youre using it.]
;W[ch]C[S.

This is an example of a move less played. Real players might play moves like this, but usually because they have never studied the game and just play by experience.

When white makes a contact move (tsuke) both white and black become thick and strong, you have the advantage becuase the first move is yours.

Because of this you might want to take a liberty away from white, or extend solidly. Either way, you walk away from this quite well off.

This is why white "shouldnt" play moves like this. (He can still do it if he wants and has a strategy to pull it off, you'll find that many players who dont really play by the book will still win games though other means.)]

(;B[ei]C[Move 4: I've had a lot of problems with my stones getting surrounded, so I tried to play a more connected game, and ran with this move. I guess that a one space jump is both reasonably secure and much faster than an adjacent connection.

S.

Yes, this move works well with your other stone. View the variations for some other ideas. :)]
;W[jd]C[S.

Here's an example of "bad" AI play.

White shouldnt be playing so low and he shouldnt play away since another move will be severe on white]

(;B[gd]C[Move 6: Similarly to move 4, I wanted to connect that stone to something else to keep it alive, so I ran with a knight's move. I wanted to get a little closer to my other stones than a one-space jump would have gotten me, and since white 5 was diagonally away from this extension, I figured I had room to do so.

S.

You are focusing too much about connection. In order to win you dont need to be 100% connected to all of your stones.]

(;W[hd]
(;B[hc]C[Move 8: I wanted to keep those stones connected.];W[eh]

(;B[fh]C[Move 10: I wanted to keep white from pushing into my other stones.

S.

Once again, youre not taking advantage of the openings in your oppnents play.

You are too focused on connection. Try and break the connection of your opponent, foil his plans.]
;W[he]
(;B[gf]C[Move 12: Again, just wanting to keep white away from my other stones. Additionally, I figured this move would allow me to keep his stones separate. I chose to play at G6 instead of G7 so white couldn't push in on G6 himself, "hitting the head of two stones." This is an extension that I am not confident about. Would it have been better to play at G7? The following sequence had me concerned that I might get overwhelmed. I think I probably would have been if white had been more aggressive.

S.

There isnt much hope of white connecting thanks to your F4 stone, so dont worry about that.

You are spreading yourself a bit thin...];W[ge]C[S.

White has moves like this which creates far too many cut points for black to handle.]
;B[fe]C[Move 14: Blocked white 13 from pushing out.];W[fd];B[gc]
C[Move 16: Staying connected.];W[ff];B[ee]C[Move 18: Again, staying connected.]

(;W[ed];B[ef]C[Move 20: As white had not yet taken the opportunity to attack again at a, I chose to atari at 20. This move also served to cut white F6 from white E4, if I am not mistaken.

S.

Make no mistake, just because a move is defensive that doesnt mean he's letting up on the attack.

If you just attack then you become too thin and your defense is shattered. The point is to attack in a way where the holes in your defence are difficult to see. They will always be there but your opponent will not always be able to handle it.

Its a matter of skill.

If your opponent strengthens his defence, his next attacks become stronger beucase you cannot attack him as easily.]
;W[hf]
(;B[gg]C[Move 22: Here, I chose to connect with 22 instead of capture at F5. I decided that connecting would both escape atari and strength my stones, where capturing would escape atari, but leave me vulnerable to another atari at 22, if white played there. Subsequently, white would be able to run amok on the right side of the board. This is one of the moves I felt most contributed to my success. Do you have any specific suggestions or feedback concerning this move or the ones that led up to it?

S.

Hmm. Lets think about this. See variation.];W[jb]C[S.

Your stones are starting to become very weak, you need to find life.

After playing out the variation, im convinced black is dead.]

(;B[eb]C[Move 24: This is another move that I believe helped me to come out ahead in this game. With white 23, I felt as though the safety of my stones on the top of the board was compromised. I considered F9, E9, F10, E10, F11, and E11 as possible moves. Ultimately, I decided that F9, F10, and F11 were too close to my stones and would not give me enough room to make two eyes.  E9 and E11 looked to be too easy to cut, so I settled on E10. What are your thoughts here? Considering the gravity of so few stones on such a small board, I believe that black 24 was an essential move to play, and that I would have surely lost without it. What do you think?

S.

I believe you've neglected these stones too much, they're doomed after K10. The just dont have enough space.

This is the gravity behind being surrounded. If you are surrounded then youre going to have a bad time. Always try to prevent it.]
;W[cd]
(;B[ce]C[Move 26: I chose to play 26 instead of D7 because I believe white would have overrun the left side of the board if he were able to play at 26 instead of a.

S.

D7 would have been horrible shape named the empty triangle. Always try to avoid this shape.

The shape you make with C7 is much better.];W[be];B[cf]C[Move 28: Similarly to move 26, I wanted to minimize white's territory on the left as much as I could. I also considered D6 and D7, but they both felt like white could push in underneath them at 28 if I hadn't played there.

S.

Thats fine, notice how the C4 and E4 stones are very likely going to die]
;W[ib];B[db]C[Move 30: With white 29, I felt my potential area for eyes in the top of the board was too small, so I sought to extend it.

S.
Good idea, not sure if it helps but as I already discussed this ill pass over this.]

(;W[bb]C[Move 31: White 31 surprised me. I assumed that white would've played at C10 to more directly minimize my space for life. I'm not sure if you have any insight here, as white was SmartGo, but do you know why a player might play at 31 instead of a?

S.

Once again, stupid move made by AI.

This is why I dont recomend playing against them.];B[cb]C[Move 32: Again, in the interest of making more space for life, I pushed against white 31.]
;W[bf]
(;B[cg]C[Move 34: I first considered playing this move at B5 to hit the head of his stones, as I have heard it to be a pretty good approach, but I felt that white could cut me easily at 34 if I didn't play there, so I took a more defensive approach and extended.

S.

Sure he can cut but what would be do after? The cut is harmless.]
;W[cc];B[hb]C[Move 36: With black 36, I wanted to flesh out my eyes more definitively.]
;W[ga]C[Move 37: Why might white have played here instead of playing at a? If white plays a, then black plays 37, white defends at J11, and black's potential eyespace has been reduced. What are your thoughts here?

S.

I cant see the point A

I assume you mean a move like H11.

This is a move designed to reduce you to only one eye. In order for you to die you only must only form less than two eyes, as long as you cannot do that then your stones will be removed from the board eventually.

Because of this, if black throws in with G then you generally must capture it in order to live. if you must remove all of the stones liberties then you end up filling in a lot of potential for eyes called eye space. Thats the logic behind this move.

Obviously, lowering your eyespace is also a strong part of killing a group.]
;B[ha]C[Move 38: I played 38 to stop white from connecting and to strengthen my eye space.]
;W[ca];B[da]C[Move 40: Again, solidifying the eye space.];W[bg]
;B[fa]C[Move 42: I chose to ignore white 41 in favor of playing the vital point at 42. At this point, my shape is certainly alive, correct? Assuming I play the correct responses to white's choise of attack, this shape cannot be killed, yes?

S.

Yes, this is alive, but at what cost? White got a free move on the bottom of the board. Is that enough to even things out? These are the questions you need to ask yourself when trading like this. Whites move was obviously sente and you ignored it.

Ignoreing sente moves is okay, its a form of trading. Its just you need to know if it was worth it.

This group was worth a lot of points so yes, it was worth it.

Once again, AI sucks beacuse he should not have tenukid. Any real player would not have allowed you to run away with such a victory.]
;W[di];B[fb]C[Move 44: I was a little nervous about letting white throw me for a loop, so I decided to play 44 to make sure my stones were alive. I didn't want to risk playing a stupid move.

S.

This "safe" play is slow and costs you valuable moves. Always try your best to not play extra safe moves as they are useless.]
;W[fi]C[S.

Look at how many moves white got in the lower left hand corner! Was that worth being extra safe when all you needed was to be safe? I think not.]
;B[ej]C[Move 46: Looking to escape atari. I know that this move is futile on the first line, but what about here? If I didn't already have stones to the right and left, would it have been possible to live with this move?]

(;W[dj]C[S.

With the lesson in mind, lets read out what happens if black descends

White has picked his side];B[fj]C[Move 48: Black 48 to atari white F3. White's stone is dead.

S.

Exactly, so you can escape the atari];W[gi];B[gj]C[Move 50: Securing the bottom of the board.]
;W[ig];B[ih]C[Move 52: With black 52, I was trying to prevent white from gaining influence in the lower right part of the board, as well as putting pressure on his stones from the strength of my stones. If white had played 52 instead of 51, wouldn't he have been able to push into that corner?

S.

There is no talk of influence on a 11x11 board, its just too small for that.

Once again, this is why i urge you play on 19x19 board. You are missing out on so much.

Please move up when you feel you are up to the challenge.

You want to stop white from entering your area, your points. And you did that, so good for you. :)]
;W[jg];B[jh]C[Move 54: Defending my territory.

S.

Good :)];W[eg]
(;B[fg]C[Move 56: Keeping my stones connected.];W[jc];B[kg]
C[Move 58: I chose to ignore white 57, as there was no play I could make in that region which would have a significant impact on my position or his. Black 58 to decrease white and increase black territory.

S.

Good endgame strategy! :D];W[kf];B[kh]C[Black 60: I believe there is a name for this particular shape at the edge of the board and, more specifically, the order the moves were played in. Typically, I have heard that it is reserved more for the end of the game. Does that mean that this game is in the "end game?" I have a hard time recognizing when I am moving through the phases of a game.

S.

The end game is after all the invasions and fighting (middle game) has been settled. All you are doing is filling in the gaps. In general by this point the score can only change so much. However you can lose and gain many points if your opponent is careless. Keep your eyes peeled. Its at this part of the game that an even match can be decided.]
;W[dh]C[Move 61: White 61 is a move that I didn't anticipate. Maybe I was too caught up with the action in the rest of the board, but I feel that this move would have killed black C3 if white had chosen to do so. If that is the case, why did white not kill black C3 at this time?

S.

Once again, AI doesnt play like a human. It does things like this. Which is why I say that you should play against human opponents if you want to become strong.]
;B[dk]C[Move 62: Black 62 decrease white and increase black.]
;W[ck];B[ek]C[Move 64: The defense.];W[de];B[df]C[Move 66: I knew that white 65 was threatening to cut black here, so I connected. This type of connection is referred to as the bamboo trees, correct?

S.

Hahaha! Bamboo trees :') Close but not quite. Its called a Bamboo Joint or the Bamboo connection.

(Im not laughing malicuously dont get me wrong, I find it funny.)]

(;W[bk];B[dd]C[Move 68: Black 68 to pressure white at E8 and F8.]
;W[hh]C[Move 69: I took this to be a bad move. Why would white play this point, knowing that I would cut at a? Why would white not play at E9 to save his stones in that region? Was there a grander scheme at work that I accidentally debunked?

S.

its a ko threat, Its a move where if you ignore it when white gets an advantage.]

(;B[hg]C[Move 70: Black 70 to kill white.];W[hj]
(;B[ii]C[Move 72: At this point, I had concluded that it is better to connect than to capture. I do not yet understand why such a notion might be true, and prehaps it isn't. Do you have any insight as to whether it is typically better to capture or connect, given the opportunity to do both?

S.

Explained in variation];W[fk]
(;B[gk]C[Move 74: Black 74 to capture and escape. White is still in atari at F3, G3, and H4, if he decides to force the play at H1.]
;W[jf];B[ba]C[Move 76: Black 76 to decrease white and increase black.]
;W[hk];B[gh]C[Move 78: Black 78 to capture and escape.

S.

Yep, not all players would do that though. Some misread under the pressure. There are many players who rely on mistakes like this in order to win games.]
;W[jj]C[Move 79: Again, why would white play here, knowing that I could kill with a? Moreover, why would white play in this corner at all? Surely, there is too little space to make life unless I ignore him completely. What are your thoughts here? Another bad move, perhaps?

S.

No idea.

But once again, ive seen other players play equally pointless moves and come away from it better off than not.

Im not saying you should play like this but be aware of it.]

(;B[ij]C[Move 80: Black 80 to kill.

S.

No need, white basically gave you a free point.

However, until you have a better grasp of life and death its a good idea to respond to moves like this. (I still do because of safety but this is where the one or two points extra for you might win you a close game.)]
;W[ec]C[Move 81: White 81 made me wish I had killed those stones earlier. However, the pressure in the lower right had me playing reactively to white for some time. I believe there is a term for this, as well. It refers to which player is playing freely and which player is responding. Do you know what it is?

S.

Nope, sorry. >_< Playing badly? Hahaha.];B[fc]C[Move 82: Black 82 to secure G10 as territory, instead of waiting and having to defend in that space.

Useless to secure points, instead aim for B9, the resulting double atari is good for you.

That makes this move sente with one point in your favor.];W[aa]
C[Move 83: Another bad move? Perhaps white expected that I would allow him to capture black stones at A10, A11, and B11 with C11? This is a pattern that I have encountered frequently, and have learned to anticipate the coming sequence.

S.

Yes, this is a misserable move]
(;B[ab]C[Move 84: However, with black 84, white B10 is in atari, and was forced to defend.]
;W[bc];B[ac]C[Move 86: Just trying to decrease white and increase black.]

(;W[de]C[Move 87: Would it have mattered if white had decided to play B8 instead of 87? Or was 87 the best move? They both would've protected white's stones there, and B8 wouldn't have been vulnerable like 87 will be.

S.

Nope, not really.];B[ad]C[Move 88: Decrease white, increase black.]
;W[dg];B[dd]C[Move 90: With white's atari at 89, I chose to play 90 instead of F6, as I could capture an additional stone. This also puts white in atari, forcing him to defend with B8. Would it have been better to play F6, in order to follow-up with black B8, or do you think white would've seen that and defended anyway?]
;W[bd]C[Move 91: With white 91, I could see that my stones only had two liberties remaining, with no way to gain additional liberties, so I defended in advance to save my stones.]
;B[aa]C[Move 92: Saving said stones. If white A7, black C11.]
;W[de]C[Move 93: Black has no choice but to play...];B[ff]C[Move 94: ...here.

S.

Yep, no problem with that

Note that in another game you could play a ko threat and recapture and capture whites stones after ignoring a ko threat from him when he runs out of good ones.

Ko is a mysterious strategy which is difficult to master, its a game of evaluation and skill.]
;W[dd]
(;B[ae]C[Move 96: Reducing white just a little bit more.];W[af]
;B[ca]C[Move 98: Securing life.];W[ji]C[Move 99: I seriously don't understand this move. Why would white play here and not defend at a? All those stones are going to die now.

S.

No point, this is a really raelly bad mistake for white];B[bh]
C[Move 100: Killing everything.

S.

Bingo.];W[cj];B[bi]C[Move 102: Securing the kill.];C[Move 103: White withdraws. In addition to any specific feedback you have already provided, what opinions do you have on larger scale? I am eager to know where I stand in the world of Go, and what suggestions you have for how I might improve. After having written in these comments, I can see that my game was not quite as solid as I thought it was, and that white just made some bad moves (I think). Are you able to determine my skill level? Can you see any significant weaknesses in my game? What do I do well? Of course, maybe these aren't even fair questions. If they are, though, I would love to hear what you have to say. Again, thank you so much for your time.

S.

Im glad how deeply you think about the game. Continue to play like this and you will improve quickly. :)

In general it helps to read books and to watch nick sibicky's videos on youtube if you havent already.

In addition to this, doing tsumego propperly will increase your strength tenfold.

The best part about being new to go is how quickly you improve. Keep at it and you wont be disapointed.

If you have any other questions feel free to email me at simon@thornewill.org, I check my email everyday and im always happy to answer your questions.

You can also send me other games to review, just make sure that they are games you've lost against human players. They will be much more beneficial for you and for me.

I hope you enjoyed the review. If you have any comments for me on how I can improve on my reviews then let me know!

The two stones at K5 and L4 are a kosumi
