;B[pc];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[Traditionally the open corner is considered larger than the kakari.]
;B[qm]C[I think taking the open corner is probably better than the pincer here.   Responding
feels to much like what white wants -- choice of which corner shimari you are going
to make AND first presence in two corners.];W[dd];B[np]C[Q15 to complete the shimari in the UL seems bigger here.  (I like Q15 better than
R15 because of the position of the R7 stone, it is low, so I think the other should
be high.)];W[on]C[Seems natural, though Q7 seems also a reasonable alternative.  What wants to settle,
contact plays work well for this.];B[qj]C[This feels too soft.  You've spent too many moves here already to be this soft
on the white group.  P8 seems much better.  R9 is still too soft, but at least
better than R10.  At this point, white can come close to settling with Q8...]
;W[mn];B[qo]C[Completely wrong direction.  At this point, you should be trying to chase the
white group.  It doesn't have a base in the corner, so there is no need to play  low/cutting move.  Also, contact plays tend to strengthen an opponents group,
you generally want to avoid them until you must, usually a final attempt to
cut/kill something.  White made a one-point jump with N6, a natural continuation
is an extension in the same direction.  M4 seems natural, L4 seems a bit light,
but L3 might be possible -- though a bit low.   Also possible would be M5.  (But,
M5 doesn't work so well with the white stone on D4.  While, on the other side,
I recommended the more attacking P7 because there was a black stone in the other
corner along that side.)

I'm not sure you can get much of anything good from this... the contact play is
going to get your position chopped nastily whatever you do here.

If/when you feel you need a play at the bottom, S5, R4, or s4 are probably better,
depending on which side you think needs eye space.  No single move can connect both
sides underneath, though S4 seems closest.];W[qp];B[pn];W[op]
;B[pp];W[oo];B[oq];W[nq]C[At this point, you've played to take corner territory, and you have lost much chance
of an attack on the white group.  So, take that, and give white the thickness in  exchange.  But, make your you do it with sente.]

(;B[mp]C[This is a major overplay, and gets you in trouble.  You can't afford to pull out here.
I think, better, would be O2 (white N3) and then look at options.  Take P7 as sente
here (white will respond, but the response can be ignore since the followup leaves
white not better off than simply white Q7 without you play P7 first).  Also, N2 may
be sente as well, depending on how white responds to P7.  Then, you have to read
whether or not you need one more move in the corner.  Played out in var 1 of previous
move...];W[nr];B[qq];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[qn];W[lq];B[lp];W[kq]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[kn];W[jo];B[ln];W[nk]
(;B[oi]C[You black group at L6 is too weak to attack from this direction -- you have to run with
your group/seperate the white group first.  A jump to L9 seems about right, though the
tactical possibilities of O7 are well worth reading out first.  (See variation on  previous move)]
;W[lk];B[jn];W[pe]C[Right now, what is the most important/urgent thing happening on the board?

I would say the fight between the black L6 group and the white O8/P6 group.

So, what result does black want from the corner exchange?  Probably more strength
facing that fight, and if possible, sente.

Since white is playing where black is stronger, black should be able to get both
of these -- or enough compensation as white tries to avoid it.

So, how to do this?  Well, O16 (played) feels like the wrong direction...what
would Q13 do to the stability of the P11/R10 stones?  Makes them a lot stronger,
more able to support the attack on the white group.  White won't kill the corner,
and will get other compensation, but black should be ok in the corner.

Then black needs to push back with something like K9.];B[nd]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[ob];W[qh]C[White is, now, alive.  Black can push a little to make thickness, how best to do
that is interesting.

R11 looks like a good start, strengthening the R7-R10-P11 connection, and making it
a solid wall between the two white groups... then, back to the familiar K9.]
;B[ri];W[rh];B[og];W[pi];B[pj];W[oj];B[ph]C[Q12 does little for black.  Probably black misread the upcoming white Q13, black R13
(atari) sequence, and thought this threatened to capture the 4 white stones.

Here, P12 and O11 both look better.];W[qi];B[rj];W[pg];B[oh]
;W[of];B[qg];W[rg];B[pf];W[qf]C[Instead of connecting (and saving two useless stones), black can come out of this
ok by O14.  See variation...]
(;B[pg];W[rf]C[Should be S15, making eyes while connecting.]
;B[oe]C[Again, an overplay.  The O14 atari (O14 - P15, N13 connecting) gives black a good
result.  Capturing this stone gains little (one or two points at best) at the
risk of the P13 stones.  The P13 stones are not strong enough to cut here, unless
black can read out a forced capture of the P14 stone.];W[nf]
;B[pd];W[qe];B[mg]C[Instead, O10 then N12 might get black out... but will not be a pleasant fight.]
;W[ng];B[nj];W[ok];B[ni]C[As becomes clear, this fails.

N10 is the only move that does get out.  It results in an ongoing and somewhat
disadvantageous to black fight, but it is better than the immediate death from
other variations.];W[mh];B[mi];W[li];B[mf];W[mj];B[ne];W[nh]
C[The game is over at this point.  What has more territory and more influence/thickness
than black and no weak groups.  Black has the K6 group as a major liability, a target
waiting for white to attack it.];B[fd];W[df];B[ff];W[ii]C[This move doesn't do anything -- it is very close to playing on neutral points.
Continuing the jumps along the side, or a deeper invastion, or an extension  along the left (say D7) would all be far better.]
;B[ch];W[ce]C[This feels odd, but actually may be reasonable, playing solid to ensure life in the
corner.  Still, E18 might be better for this purpose... unclear.]
;B[om];W[nm]C[Wrong.  O6 is far better, black can't cut and gets far fewer forcing moves.]

;B[fo];W[go];B[gn];W[gp];B[gm];W[il]C[A tiny move -- at best 6 points in gote.

Far bigger moves abound, C6, F18, or E13 all look interesting.  My preference would
be for C6, though.];B[hl];W[ik];B[fp];W[fq];B[dn];W[eo]C[Ugly sequence here for white... this has got to end up with bad shape.]
;B[en];W[ep];B[fn];W[hk]C[Small, again.  This black group has become fairly settled now.  The top is bigger, or  something like D11.  (Basically, this move does little to the black group... if
intending to attack, don't play close to the stones you are attacking.  Also, don't
play close to your own strong/thick stones.  This does both, and so does little.)]
;B[eb]C[Nice choice to ignore white.  This starts to make the top look like territory.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[dc];B[bo]C[A move to grow this group looks important, but the C12 stone is also weak.  D10 works
nicely to connect both groups and start on making territory on the left -- probably a
better choice in this area than B5.

Tactically, C3 might be the move to play here.  Or, after the black group is more
settled (with D10) then C3.];W[if]C[Too conservative.  White can, and should, go deeper here.    Hm... maybe E12 - D10; G15 - F15; J16 to make black sweat.

Or, probably just start with J16.];B[id];W[hd];B[hc]
(;W[he]C[Too conservative.  Cross-cut at J17.  White might lose the H16 stone, but will almost
definitely penetrate to at least the 3rd line, probably second line, and might cut  this into two groups.

Possible variation shown at last move.];B[jd];W[le];B[ld];W[me]
C[Should play L15 instead... the threat of L16 (with sequences after G17) is bigger than
the connection at N15, so black needs to respond with L16, then white still gets N15 if
white wants it.];B[ke];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[cq]C[C3 is a big move.]

;W[mk];B[rl];W[gl];B[fl]C[You are right to ignore the atari here -- connecting is small.  But, F8 is not
the best switch.  It doesn't move far enough.  How about D10?]

(;B[nm]C[This fight gets complicated, but it this move is worth looking at because it threatens
to cut accross the connection between P7 and O9 or the connection between P7 and N6,
or maybe, both.

Even if not played, future plays by black (and white) should be made with an awareness
of this possibility and their affect on it.  In particular, If black plays L9 (my
preferred move) and white continues with a jump as well (O11 seems natural), how
has the black stone at L9 changed this move?  Does it work any better?  I think
it now looks more likely to succeed.  Maybe white has to make a different choice
than O11?

Or maybe, white can protect with something like N8, so if this works, it is better
to play it immediately.  I can't read deeply enough (and there are too many diverging
lines) to know if this is the right move, but it definitely is an interesting one, and
I think it gives black a good fight.];W[om];B[mm];W[pk];B[qk]
