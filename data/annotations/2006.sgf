;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq]C[I've read that this is not so good for b. q3 in response to q16 gives w a nice opportunity to kakari and extend up the right side, forming a frame-work.

if you want to do a 3-4 point, r4 might be better.

not sure i know what im talking about here . . . . but it's food for thought!:-]
;W[dd];B[qn];W[cn];B[cp]C[c4 is probably not what i'd do here.  it doesn't put as much pressure as it could on c6, and it only encloses corner territory.

with your q3-r6 formation on the right, i'd try to either build a moyo, or drive w towards it.

c8 seems a good way to do either of these.  the joseki starting at d6, w d7, b e7 is also kind of neat for moyo building -- but it could work well for w with his d16 stone.    anyway, it's a cool joseki with simple forks that nobody knows.  definitely a good one to look up!]
;W[dj];B[gq]C[this seems very small to me.

a quick count give black 36points on the board, without great potential to expand.  if w were to move next at say -- k16, i think b would definitely have an uphill battle.

i would look at approaching the q16 stone somehow, or, if you want to make territory play at k3 or k4.]
;W[lq]C[
w has given you a real gift here i think.  this seems too agressive -- and attack at n4 would limit your moyo and at the same time be light enough to skip away.

seems to me that w could just play to match your moyo building as well . . . . (like k17)]
;B[jq]C[
correct approach! this is better than o3 for two reasons: it takes more territory; it doesn't allow w to make a two space extension on the side.]
;W[lo];B[qg]C[
seems you've turned the tide back your way.];W[qj];B[og];W[oj]
;B[nr]C[
i don't understand the urgency of o2.  your group seems able to make life on the side, and the r13 group is still to weak if you're trying to drive together the two white groups for a big kill.

also, this group is probably going to get shut in, so it's value is limited anyway.

to me, the urgency is in stabilizing your r13 stones.  i don't know the proper way to do this, but o17 and o11 both seem interesting.]
;W[mc]C[now you are in a bind! :-(];B[re];W[rc]C[if i was w, i'd be happy with the s15, s17 exchange.  w has solidified his corner, and you still lack a certain eye.  running away to the center, preserving the option to invade at r17 might have been a better course for black.]
;B[hc]C[ouch! this is very painful for black! it invites . . . .]
;W[jc]C[. . . . the approach at k17! this gets w more secure territory, places pressure on h17, and puts even more pressure on the r13 group.

h17 might be used instead to run away with n13, with an eye towards moving towards the top for life or strangling the r10 stones.]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[eb];W[db];B[cg];W[ce]C[again, w is probably very happy.  since h17 he's gained ~18pts of certain territory, and in exchanged you've gotten two new weak groups, and placed more pressure on your original weak group at r13.

having three weak groups is never good!];B[eg];W[ed]C[a little slow for white -- he's showing you mercy i think!

imagine if instead of e16 w plays f15.  seems like if you defend the h17 group, white's knights move to g13 puts tremendous pressure on both r13 and c13 groups.  on the other hand, if he plays to strenghten c13 stones, sealing your stones at h17 becomes possible.]
;B[fd];W[fe];B[gd];W[ff];B[bi];W[bk];B[ci];W[di];B[dh];W[gj]
;B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[cb];B[bf];W[be]C[
w is far too kind here.  j15 is a much better move for white.  if you ignore and play from b14 (which is tiny attack! it's less than 10pts in gote! :-()

it's hard to say you're making bad or good moves here.  this whole thing is very messy for black because you made three weak groups for youself.  i've been quiet for the past couple moves because i just can't see anywhere you could move and not hurt your other groups!

though . . . i think i would've concentrated on my r13 group -- trying to build strength there to kill r10.  that seems like the best hope for victory.]
;B[cf];W[ne]C[again, w is too kind.  j15 seems critical for him.  he threatens to kill your h17 group.  if you defend that, then he should have no problem killing r13.  (or at least making it puny and building strenght to attack the bottom/territory in the center.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qi];W[pi]C[another bad move for white.  he needs a more creative way to defend his connection -- like maybe q7? q11 falls into your trap, and lets you push him around. :-)]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[mg];W[pf];B[pg];W[ie]C[imagine if w had done this before you built up some strength in your r13 group!]
;B[he];W[id];B[hd];W[hf]C[a gift by white!

seems like w f18 and white can eat out your eyespace.  w should still be able to catch your group without h14 . . .  .]
;B[gb]C[good defense.];W[kf]C[seems silly for white.  he should play something like m10 to try to strangle your group/build strength for his own weak group?]
;B[fg];W[en];B[cj];W[ck];B[df]C[e14 seems better.  gives the possibilit of a cut at e15 someday.

but notice how many stones you spent for so little reward . . . . and that's with w bungling his attack on you!

creating three weak groups was the big problem for black in this game.]
;W[om];B[oo];W[mj];B[qe];W[pe];B[qd];W[qc];B[qf];W[lh];B[mi]
;W[li];B[lg];W[nf];B[ng];W[kg];B[le]C[it's not clear to me why w can't just cut at m14 here? maybe im missing something under my nose?

even better for white -- why not take s12 and kill black?];W[ld]
;B[lf];W[ke];B[rh]C[whew! you got to live! white was really nice to you -- you had three weak groups and he let them all live!

they all lived pretty small though . . .:-(];W[jp]C[a little aggressive.  seems like j5 would pen you in better.]
;B[ip];W[kp];B[io]C[excellent move!  this move combined with making all three groups live gets you back in the game!]

;W[rn];B[ro];W[rm];B[pm];W[pl];B[pk];W[ol];B[nn];W[jm];B[jl]
;W[kl];B[il];W[jo];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml]C[up to hear you've done a good job of reducing white's center territory.  n8 isn't so good though.

extending in the direction of g8 or k11 would be bigger.];W[lk]
C[small for white.];B[nk]C[small for black];W[ok]C[small for white]
;B[nj]C[small for black];W[ni]C[small for white.];B[mh]C[small for black.

there were far bigger moves for both players all around the board during this sequence.  we've talked about extending form black's j stones -- a white defense against this would've been better.  there's also b5 area for both players, as well as the upper and lower sides.]
;W[mk]C[small];B[nl]C[small];W[on];B[mo]C[incorrect, need to defend at q5 to both insure connection of o6 stones and block s4.]
;W[ln]C[small.  tragic, since s4 is available.];B[mp]C[less small -- but still not b5 or j18 or defending s4]
;W[kq]C[small];B[jr];W[qk]C[seems unecessary for white, because of o7.  s4 is much better for white, i think.]
;B[qo]C[good!];W[mq]C[small];B[nq];W[ib]C[good!];B[hb]C[nice defense!]
;W[gl];B[jj];W[ji];B[pc]C[from this move on, not much worth commenting on.  q17 is a stab in the dark desperation move, when there are still real moves available at b5, and expanding from k10 and f13 groups.

this game was charachterized by three issues:

1) The creation of three weak black groups.  This led to black struggling for life all over the board, unable to make significant territory and unable to move without hurting his other stones.

This is the prime reason you lost.

When playing, I often just look at the board and say "would that move make a group weak?" if so, I don't make it.  Also, if you have a weak group, if at all possible sacrifice it.  if not, then save it quickly! :-)

2) White's failure to take advantage of Black's weak groups.  For some reason, time and again white let you off easy when he should've pounded you flat.  It's a testament to white's timidity (and your scrappy, fighting spirit!) that you lost by so little!

3) Black and White's mutual failure to make big moves in the late-midgame.  If you had picked up two or three of these moves, you probably could've picked up the win, despite your weak groups in the opening.]
