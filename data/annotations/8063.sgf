C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe, general thoughts on this game can be found on the last move.

I'm black];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[rp]C[I thought this move was bad

buckyyowza: right, locally this play is solid, but here is a little slow.]
;B[cn]LB[jd:A]C[buckyyowza: Here, white can pincer this stone to build on the left side and regain some of the lost momentum from playing S4, so this is not an ideal place to start for play.  In this position, black has more influence on the board and having sente this early has little need to attack.  I would prefer to make a big play like K16, and come out a stone ahead.  This early, black want to take as much as possible and let white fight to get some back.]
;W[cl]
(;B[cq]C[standard joseki

buckyyowza: I prefer E6 here.  Black is better poised for a center game now, and taking this path now reduces that effect by giving white a strong presence on left side.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[di]
(;B[jd]TR[jp]C[buckyyowza: K16 is definitely bigger.  K4 is neutral at this point - though large later on it is sitting between a strong white group and a strong black group.  With K16, black is ahead of things going into the middle game.

there are only two big points left

I decided that this move was better];W[cf];B[fc];W[qg];B[qi]
LB[oh:A]C[buckyyowza: this is too conservative if the purpose is to preserve the right side group.  This stone can easily invade the upper right corner or suvive lightly on it own where it is.  As long as black stays thick, maintaining two eyes on the right side group is not as important as cutting white off from the center.  A play like P12 puts more pressure on the R13 stone while increasing black's influence on the upper side and center.

If I dont do this my lower group will be in danger];W[ql]C[buckyyowza: I would expect white to follow up after R13. Black's stone at R11 forces a response, so this tenuki is too early.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[pm];W[rn]
(;B[qo]LB[og:A]C[buckyyowza: white has already succeeded here.  locally, it is better for black to play at R9, but this aji is best left for later.  Better to trade this area for the upper right - why not cap the R13 stone at P13 instead?]
;W[ro]
(;B[qp]LB[og:B][jp:A]C[I think this move was bad :(

buckyyowza: right, the last two black plays are aji keshi. A large play at K4 is now appealing, but I still prefer P13 to punish white for not following up after R13.]
;W[qq];B[qk]C[buckyyowza:  this is an overplay as this would normally be gote yose. White can safely ignore this play.]
;W[pn];B[rl];W[rm]
(;B[on]C[Im trying to use the aji left];W[oo]C[but with this I dont know if the move before was good or not

buckyyowza: it seems you tend to play too close to white stones in this game.  this aji would better serve your intentions with a play around M4 instead of Q6]
(;B[pg]LB[pf:B][og:A]C[I wanted to use my influence so I didn't mind if he went to the corner

buckyyowza: in general, it is better to avoid touching a stone in this sort of situation.  White can use the aji left by this play to his advantage in making life.  This play should be at P13 or Q14 to prevent white from making life here.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[od]LB[oc:A]C[buckyyowza: this is too lenient.  Considering the local situation (R13 is too far to help), R17 is a 3-3 invasion without support.  P17 will more effectively contain this invasion.]
;W[oc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb]
(;B[lc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[jp]C[buckyyowza: This is a very large move - black should have take this area earlier as there have been several opportunities.]
(;B[hq]LB[nn:A]C[This move doesn't seem correct. But I wanted to destroy white influence

buckyyowza: this has very little effect on white, and does little to contain the influcence from the K4 stone.  Better to play at O6 to accomplish this]
;W[ir];B[iq]C[buckyyowza: J2 was gote for white, black should play away now instead of always responding locally to these plays.  There is little profit in this area now.]
;W[jq];B[hr];W[nn];B[nl];W[nm];B[ml];W[ji]
(;B[lh]LB[hj:A]C[to protect my territory i did this move. Maybe in other place?

buckyyowza: there is no threat here - only a small reduction.  I am concerned now about white thickness growing in the left center.  I would prefer H10 to make white work for this.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[kk];B[go]C[I tried to do a leaning attack step by step and in the end try to kill the center white group

buckyyowza: white is safe as long as he can connect to D11, which would be hard to stop now.  Nonetheless, G5 is good as it erases the white moyo forming here.]
;W[fo];B[gn];W[fn]
(;B[gm]LB[fj:A]C[buckyyowza: continuing to extend this wall is back for black, since white gets easy strength and significant profit on the left side.  F10 looks better to me.]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[el];B[fk];W[ek];B[gi]LB[jm:A]C[buckyyowza: white can simply K7 now and erase black's intent with this play.  Since black finished off the situation on the left first, white no longer needs to choose which area to protect.]
;W[li]
(;B[mi]C[buckyyowza: L12 is better now.  This sort of hane only helps white form eye space, though with K7 still available it matters little whether white can form eyes.]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[mj];B[ni]LB[kj:A][jm:B]C[he resisted the atack

buckyyowza: There is little to gain here, so this is another premature yose gote.  White can easily live with L10 or K7 at any time.]
;W[kg];B[lf];W[hk]
(;B[gl]C[buckyyowza: consider instead the weakness at C12 - F9 is only stones, which are not crucial to black's game.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[bc]C[now I didn't know what to do. what is the correct answer here?

buckyyowza: I prefer B16 here.]
(;B[cb];W[be];B[ln];W[lp];B[jm];W[hi];B[hh];W[hj];B[ih]C[I tried to make some territory up]
;W[jl];B[il];W[ik];B[kl];W[ii];B[jk];W[jj];B[dh]LB[ef:A]C[a leaning attack. My purpose was to close my moyo]
;W[ch];B[dg];W[cg];B[de];W[ei];B[jf]C[buckyyowza:  A fine move by black :)  Now the game is close to even - despite a very weak opening by white, black has slowly lost momentum throughout the middle game due to slack play.  Here, that momentum is regained leaving a close endgame.]
;W[df];B[ef];W[eg]
(;B[ff]C[buckyyowza: I think F13 is worth a few more points here.  While leaving a weakness like E15 is not ideal in an undecided middle game, here at the end everything can be read out to maximize profit.]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[lb];B[kb];W[kf];B[ke];W[jg]
(;B[if]C[buckyyowza: to reiterate, in yose everything can be read out to maximize profit. J13 is worth one more point.  If both F13 and J13 are played, black only needs 1 more point to win ;-)]
;W[ig];B[hg];W[jh]C[now all is yose

buckyyowza: White gives black the gift of sente! It should be easy to win now.]
;B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[bn];B[ce];W[bd];B[mo];W[om]
(;B[ol]C[buckyyowza: though tempting, this is not protecting anything. Isn't the area above this stone dame?  I would rather continue to push at N4, then take K2, B18, or another large play.]

;W[gj];B[fj]
(;W[fi]C[buckyyowza: white is too nice, now is the time for E15]
;B[ee]C[I thought there could be some problems

buckyyowza: Yes, white B18  and G10 has left a weakness here for black, so protecting is important.  This is one move too late, but that is OK since white didn't take advantage.]

[fs]C[buckyyowza: Thank you for the opportunity to review this game - there was a lot happening here, and all phases of the game stayed relevant :)  In general, black's opening and yose are strong for play at this level, but you are lacking the fighting spirit needed for a strong middle game.  I would suggest studying more tesuji and to work on using thickness in the center to your advantage in eliminating groups left behind from earlier play.  Your main weakness in this game was to carry local situations out further than warranted, leaving your opponent with a stronger position and sente more often than not.  Remember, go is a not meant to be a polite game - it is a war! always try to take the most advantage of every situation without leaving any weakness behind. I hope you have enjoyed reading through my comments, and find that they help to illustrate these points :)  Again, thank you, and if you have any further questions about this game please let me know.
