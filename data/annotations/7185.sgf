C[Hi, personally i feel that this game quite conforms to my standard. I don't see anything really wrong myself. Well that's the problem if i can't see anything wrong i can't improve right?

So anyway thx for reviewing my game ^^


[JB\] Hello, I am Jorge and I will try to do my best.

My summary comes here (detailed analysis during the game):

- Be calm during fuseki. Black does NOT neet to attack as fast as possible; first build influence.

- While you switched to different places during mid-game, at some moments it looks like you focus too much in local moves and forget the rest of the board.

- In yose you lost many points by wasting moves (playing in places where it is not really needed)

- Try to think clear goals for each stone (e.g. attack the white center while connecting your own groups) and then find the best point to accomplish

- At some points in the game (after fusekin, after a big fight, at beginning of yose) estimate the game result

Thanks for showing me this great game. We are quite close in handicap so please forgive my mistakes.]
;B[pd]C[min3 [7k\]: hi
jChIaM [8k?\]: hi];W[dd];B[qp];W[dq];B[oq];W[cn]C[[JB\] Usually white plays near Q10 to avoid a big black extension there]

(;B[fc]C[Is this direction of approach ok? i was thinking of C14 but wasn't really confident of attacking in that direction.

[JB\] As I have said Q10 is very big. That extension from the shimari is good enough, then if white attacks you are in good position to defend, settle and invade later. Also notice that white wants to play near K4.]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[id];W[hd];B[he];W[ic];B[jd];W[jc];B[kd]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[fd];B[ee];W[ed]C[[JB\] You could play Q10 now, but white has got a lot of space and strength and he is in a better position now. Probably K4 is a good point for black, then white must play in the right side and you can push him.

So far I see two issues:
- you were thinking to attack as soon as possible, ommitting an excellent point (but this is a style matter probably)
- you were concerned with a local fight and ommitted a big point. It is important to keep the whole board in sight, in special if you are behind locally (many people, including myself, stucks to try to revert a bad local result and does not see a point in other part of the board that can revert the global position).]

(;B[de];W[ce];B[cd];W[cf];B[kc];W[cc]C[[JB\] The white group at the top is not in danger, though white may have played here to avoid problems in the corner.]
;B[cj];W[qf];B[ph]C[[JB\] Considering the shimari at the bottom, I think R11 or Q10 are better.]
;W[qd];B[qc]C[[JB\] I would have played Q15 or Q14 now, to avoid weakness and to use the high wall at H15. Anyway, the problem building a framework around M15 is that white can jump from D14, reducing a lot and attacking C10.]
;W[rd];B[pe];W[pf];B[of];W[rc];B[pc];W[qh]C[[JB\] You can see that Q12 would be better at Q10. Since you are not going to make a lot of territory below P14, it would be better to have some framework using P3-R4-Q10-K4.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[eh]C[[JB\] This stone is a bit doubtful: it doubts to attack C10 or to reduce M14 framework. If a stone does not have a clear intention it probably does nothing.]
;B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[fj];B[hk]C[[JB\] This is big but you have a weak point at P13 that can be exploited, and C10 is getting weaker. Anyway, this sequence shows that E12 was not a good point.]
;W[oe]
(;B[ne]C[[JB\] Why not P13 or O14? You are strong there. P13 is dangerous (see variations); O14 is safest and still avoids white P13.]
;W[og];B[nf];W[pg]
(;B[nh]C[[JB\] It is not easy to close the gap. You should never let white come into a hole like this; better play not so close, e.g. O13 and then O10.]

[jh][ih][ig][hf][hg][hh][qq][rq][rr][qr][qs][rs][sr][ss][sq]
[pr][ps][pq]C[[JB\] This one helps white to close around C10. That is big.

Before this obne we have a good moment to pause and analyze.

What would be the game outcome now?
White 78.5 , black 46 (approx)
Of course the bottom left is quite open, so it could be a 15 point difference, and white must be careful to live with the right side...
But the point is that you need a really big point, or escape with C10.
Around K4 could be a move serving 3 purposes: attack M10 from far, make some territory at the bottom, and provide an escape spot for C10.
Even if white lives AND gets C10, you may get more than 20 extra points in the bottom and right side (e.g. by attacking M10 and R11 groups you  can close R10 and the bottom side).]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[en];W[nm];B[dn]
(;W[cm]C[[JB\] This move is not really bad if white plans to connect with D3, but C10 has aji...
So here C8 or D8 would make a better response.];B[dp];W[cq]
C[[JB\] Now this move IS bad when combined with C7, because it allows black to aisolate the C7 stones.
In the best case, after living in the bottom white would need an extra move to protect the C7 group.]
;B[cp]
(;W[ep];B[bp];W[bq];B[eo];W[fp];B[dl]C[[JB\] I think white should have answered this move. He still can play D9 and lose some stones or start a ko.

When black takes E8, the game looks better for him (white still has to live with its O7 group and he will not have points at the left side).]

;W[rh];B[pp];W[hj];B[gj];W[ij];B[eg]C[[JB\] Black has improved a lot and white is still concerned with his M10 stones.
We will count again in a few moves...];W[dh];B[dg];W[cg]
(;B[oo]C[[JB\] A safe move, though it may help the white central group.
What about O6? (variation)];W[on];B[jq];W[hq];B[jo];W[kp];B[jp]

[an][am][bm][cm][cn][dm][el][fm]C[[JB\] After the fight, now we have a good time to count again.
White about 63.5, black around 87 points.
Now it is time to be conservative, and cash in the points at yose.

Good candidates are C8 (avoiding white D9 problem and looking at C12 cut), J2, L18, K11 or K12 (block white and have an eye on J9). All of them look quite big.]
;B[im];W[io]C[[JB\] This one looks lika a mistake. Black can answer K8 and white is in danger.]

(;B[ho];W[ip];B[jh];W[ek]C[[JB\] As I said before, D9 looks better.]
;B[cl];W[co];B[bm];W[bo];B[ap];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[il]C[[JB\] K8 better. He cannot cut due to G8-H9.]
;W[jl];B[rl]C[[JB\] Not needed yet. Wasting a move in this moment would mean wasting some 8-10 points or more. You have plenty of liberties.

;W[ef];B[fg];W[ff];B[gf];W[fh];B[gg];W[lh];B[lg];W[ji];B[ih]
;W[ik];B[ii];W[kj]C[[JB\] Notice how big white got in the center. Given its initial position, he should have been reduced much more.]
;B[rb]
(;W[rf]C[[JB\] A wasted move, I think. White should live here anyway (S13 and S14 are miai if I am not wrong)
Anyway, black would be about 20 points ahead.];B[sb];W[kb];B[lb]

C[[JB\] Notice that you have played 3 moves in your territory to get those stones. T10 would have been enough.

Notice that white got too close due to these moves and your failure to attack the center properly.]
