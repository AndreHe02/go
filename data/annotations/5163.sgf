C[samabcde [5k\]: hi

hello I am samabcde, the loser of this game.This is my first time to send game for

review if I did anything wrong please tell me

please go to 18th moves

janr: All that I can say on this game is that white made an early and fatal joseki mistake.  If you do not know the joseki, be careful and try to calculate what will happen before you force your opponent to cut apart your stones as in this game.

Probably games that are longer and contain less subtle mistakes (which can not be found in publicly available joseki dictionaries), are more interesting to send in for review.]

Please consult a joseki dictionary for more variations.];B[qn]

Of course they died in my games.

After seeing my game , what you think I

can improve?

At last I would like to say "Thank you"

janr: white has little hope as the ladders are unfavourable due to the marked stones.
I dont see a way to save the stones at this point.]
