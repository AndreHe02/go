Atacked on the wider side

Comment: You want to attack the corner with this stone, so you WANT the corner! Don't forget about this halfway.]
;W[oe]C[shellgame defends. Tis seems to be hamete:
A trick move which leeds to a poor result if black plais it right

Question: how could i show white that this move has too high ambitions?

Answer: This is a pretty complicated problem. I'll list you a few alternatives to your move, but it depends a LOT on the situation you are in. In this game you probably could even play Tenuki.]

(;B[ld]C[now i play a pretty loose move and afterwards think this could eventually ba punnised]
;W[nc]C[the punishing begins just the second afterwards];B[nd]
C[and i try to protect it];W[od]C[so hea closes the cut];B[mc]
C[attack and think this is the right move];W[pc]C[and in the end he won a pretty sizeable corner and safety from the exchange

QUESTION:
die he got the better of that trade?

Comment:
White got a BIG corner, but you are most likely alive. So it could be worse.]
;B[ob]C[does this one actually give my oponent the possibility to play somewhere else without losing much?]
;W[pb]
(;B[nb]C[This one was neccesary now right?];W[pi]C[aaand he meakes a pretty save base

Doesn't look that save to me yet. And you've got sente now. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Go_terms#Gote_and_Sente basically: you can choose where you want to continue)

You are already quite save up there (your group has one eye and will probably live), so you might want to look for bigger points on the board. (Check the later options in this variation)]

(;B[hc]C[i so the same and at the same time try to do kind of an invade

QUESTION:
 would after this turn a n approach on f17 be too thick?
is an approach at e17 possible?];W[qn]C[normal approach while strengthening his stone

Question: Defend or try invasion?];B[np]C[high defense wanting the influence more than a safe base

QUESTION:
when is high defense better end when the low one?

Comment:
To make it simple:
A stone on the third line(from the side of the board) is a territory based stone. Normally no one can slip under a third line stone.
A stone on the fourth line is aimed to gain influence. Influence is good for fights and other stuff. 
The best way is to keep a balance between 3rd and 4th line.]

(;W[dj]C[hes plajing the biggest side which is a good move]

(;B[gq]C[now i am trying to be safe from an invade

Afterwards id say it is not the one thing neither the other and that propably j3 would have been better.

What do you think?];W[cn]C[obvious move i could invade]
(;B[co]C[shellgame [-\]: B5 forces B6 sente

what does he mean?

Comment: Look at previos move for answer.

I];W[dn]C[he has big potential of points on the right and left and i souhd really do some invadingstuff

Comment:
Yeah, you are totally right! Invading is a good idea :) Let's look at what's possible:
D10, D6, C6 seems to be really save, I definitely wouldn't invade there!
D16 Corner is still open and you've got a stone near it.
R6 still looks kinda lonely.]
(;B[ql]C[invasion is ok?
how could i have played the sequence afterwards better without losing that much?

Comment:
I think this was the best and safest place to invade.];W[on]

REALLY complicated situation! O.o]

(;B[kq]C[i have the feeling this move was unneccesary ? making me unnecesary thik and giving him mor wall

rather take the group?

I'd suggest taking the group, but it might depend on playing style. Taking the group strenghtens the cutting point k6 though.]
;W[jq];B[ln]C[maybe my move on l3 gave him strength do invadethe left corner?

He's still pretty powerless, but let's see.];W[fq]C[and how is this to be handled

I'm not sure how strong your opponent is, but it's either a testing move or he wants to trick you.]
