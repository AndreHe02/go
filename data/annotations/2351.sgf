;B[pd]C[I
picked this game because I can't see any big mistakes in it, but he ended
up winning. So I made strategic mistakes, probably early in the game, around
move 25? That's what I'm wondering about for this game.

;W[ke]C[I
didn't respond to his L15, but instead went over to the left side. Turns
out his territory at the top was too big, maybe the decisive factor in the
end. Should I have responded here and left the left side for now?


::
Well, white has not captured the black stone yet. She will have to invest
at least one more move to do so. There are quite many white stones around
there (quite chunky and inefficient). So somehow white has some sort of right
to have territory up there.
The right side is quite dominated by black
- a lot of potential territory. Whereas the left side - currently dominated
by white - is not as solid as the right - black - moyo.

I think it is legitimate to tenuki.]
(;B[cj]C[I
do C10 when I can't decide which way to attack. Not a good reason. I would
have done C6 but I thought that would have given him the whole left side.


::
C10 - the move actually played - is definitly worse than C6 would have been.
Remember: Don't touch opponents stone to attack. Touch them if you defend
- but stay away from the opponent forces if you want to attack. Touching
strenghtens the stone(s) touched. You don't want that to happen when you
attack - of course. So - stay away from these enemy stones! ;-)

It is not a good idea to let white seal you in! Your group is open at the
bottom and will therefore have hard times to live. Better try to escape first.]

::
Wrong direction! Why not let white have territory there. Better consider
to play form your stones to the right. There ist even more territory for
you than for white if you play from outside the corner (see variation)!]

you see the principle 'don't touch (or get close) opponent stones if you
want to attack' at work. Interesting to see, isn't it?];W[qm]

::
You could try to create one of these situations where the opponent has to
choose. The choice could be in the left group or the invading group to the
right (at least parts of these).
So instead of...];B[on]C[

:: ... peeping just the one group I'd rather play more to the left. Right inbetween the two groups.]

:: My conclusion: Tactically the players were quite equal. Actually I liked black's endgame better. 
The play in the bottom right corner was not that good, though. 
There were some mistakes in the direciton of play I already pointed out. 
I'd like to add that the mistake was not move 25 - as I've pointed out. Actually I think it was a good idea to tenuki.

Hope this helps to improve you game!

I think you can play here even farther from your stones. White cannot really
jump in between since your escape would threaten the white stones to the
left.];W[kq];B[io];W[ko];B[fn];W[hp];B[ip];W[ho]C[

::
That looks uglier than it is. Please note the black stone to the right poking
into everything that could become white's territory. This stones will make
it possible to quite reduce white's territory there. And - actually white
has no time to make territory there (by playing L4 e.g.) - she will have
to worry about the top left edge first.

The sequence is quite a ficiton - I know - but it helps to make some points.]
