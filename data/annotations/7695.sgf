There is a lot of material on opening theory available.
As far as free material, shygost publishes "the list" but then charges for lessons to interpret what it means :)
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Shygost#toc1

I have a book called "The fundamentals of go" which is pretty good at all skill levels.  "The direction of play" also addresses this in its opening chapters, but is really intended for dan players (AKA, a tough read).]
;B[nq];W[jc]C[****
I believe this is the wrong direction to extend from this corner. The two stones in the lower right can be thought of as the start of a box shape.  That means that an extension by black is extra valuable along the right side.  Since white can profit roughly equally by extending along either the top or the right, it's best to extend along the right because it limits black's growth.  In most opening theory that I've seen, the sample problem would be when R4 is at R3, but the same basic principle should apply.

Opening really revolves around the ability to grow the territory of stones and reduce the territory of your opponent's stones.  This is done through more or less obvious ways along with shifting the relative strength of groups.  Probably the biggest hole I see in your play is a large disregard for the weakness of your groups.  That leaves a literal minefield for your to navigate through the later phases of the game.  Establishing strong groups that can grow in strength and territory should ultimately lead to more wins for you.]

2nd line plays are rarely correct in the opening.  Center influence can be more valuable than the mild territorial profit that comes with this play.  Black should live easily,  If you feel threatened, try to look for moves that allow for more dynamic growth.  Personally, I like G15 for since it stabilized your stones, puts strong pressure on black's corner, and starts growth into the center.]
;B[cg];W[cn];B[je];W[qj]C[****
Extensions should be chosen carefully based on the relative strength of surrounding groups.  The lower black corner is stable.  The upper black group is weaker, but you have an even weaker group to the left, which makes it stronger than it migght appear.  Factoring in how the Q16 stones are floating on the 4th line and really need to be defended, I think your extension is way too far.  I probably wouldn't extend past R13 given the board situation.]

You can't leave any weak groups lying around, and you're currently up to 3! H3 is an overplay.]

This is another overplay.  You're only making your weak group weaker, and you already have too many weak groups!]

Black S16 followed by T16 seems way too kind to you.  I tried out some variations where black is more aggressive, but I think they still need a defensive move before getting aggressive.  It's also improbable that the final S18 move would be played by black.  It's probably better to enclose you and force you to play something like that in gote instead.]

C[I feel like I'm playing passivly. However, I tend to play too agreesive and get a lot of my groups killed.

Actually, this move feels aggressive.  if you play this move, you must be able to answer this question: Will you succeed in killing?  If the answer is not "yes", then it's probably the worng move.  You have a really weak group (that's been week forever).  Rest assured that if you fail to kill, that your group is probably dead.]

See variations starting with your previous move for a ko. Also, this group is stone cold dead now.  Any further plays for the group is simply giving free points to your opponent.]
