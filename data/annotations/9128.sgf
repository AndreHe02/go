AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hello!
I'm playing black in this game. It's one of my first games on IGS. Before I was mainly playing on turn based servers like Dragon Go Server and OGS. On these servers, my rating is around 20k.
As IGS only provides "Beginner" as a rank for 17+, I selected this and searched for a random opponent. While playing I didn't know the strength of my opponent.

After the game I went over it and added some questions comments to explain my thinking.

Thanks for the review!

D: Hello. My comments starts with letter D.];W[pq];B[hs]C[This was actually a stupid mistake. It was my first game on the tablet and I just misplaced this stone. It should have gone to f3.]
;W[qo];B[cm];W[fq];B[dq];W[hq]
(;B[qj]C[I decided to ignore white's moves around my misplaced stone because i counted it already as lost.
After the game I wonder whether I should have tried to keep the stone in the game with playing f2 for example?

D: I don't think you should cling to that stone. By the way, f2 doesn't work.
See variations.
You can play E2 later as a threat to connect stones.

As for the current move, playing corner enclosure or making three-star formation on top is more balanced.]
;W[hr];B[ch];W[is];B[jd]SQ[dd][pd]C[To be honest, at this point, I was thinking that my opponent is not terribly strong. I was wondering why white was spending 3 moves on my misplaced stone and I had a pretty good feeling about having set some nice loosly connected stones about everywhere else on the board.

Should I not have placed stones in every corner and on every border but rather only on half the corners and more closely together, like for example not playing q10 but f17 instead?

D: I like this move. Your stones act together now. You have sanrensei formation (marked) and extensions from it.
Q10 or F17 is a matter of what you plan to do, it's not like one move is obviously superior here.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[D: Perhaps blocking the other way is better.];W[dc]
;B[ec];W[bd];B[be];W[ad];B[ae];W[bb]
(;B[gc]C[cm\I guess this move is not standard joseki?
I had the feeling that e16 or c15 would be too defensive.

Maybe f16?

D: G17 is inferior to both E16 and C15 as it doesn't protect cutting points.

It's not a standard joseki long time ago)
After defending position B might launch sever attack. See variation]
;W[ce];B[bf]
(;W[de];B[ed]C[D: W exploit cut in harmless way.];W[cf];B[bg]
;W[eb];B[fb]
(;W[ea];B[fa];W[db];B[nc]TR[ce][de][cf]C[I'm changing the area of play here (there is a japanese term for that, right?) because I though my groups around b14 and e16 are safe, while the white group around c15 has no where to go.
Later I will see that I maybe should have spent more attention. Should I end the sequence with e13?

D: Your groups are stable enough. If W's marked group runs it should help you gain profit in the process.
Enhancing corner seems better for me.
Japenese term for this is "tenuki".];W[ee];B[fe];W[ff];B[ge]
;W[gf];B[eg];W[ef]
(;B[hf]C[Maybe the is too close?
As an afte game analysis I think about i14 or i13?

D: This is strong move. It helps you to force W to help you in building territory.]
;W[hg];B[if];W[he];B[gd];W[ie];B[jf];W[je];B[ke];W[fg]
(;B[eh]C[Maybe here again, I should rather try to limit the space for whites group from the outside, like f11 or e11?

D: This move denies W eyes for group.
What's your actual target of "limiting space"? If it's killing group then group gains little for W as it is. It's better to enlarge your own framework.]
;W[fh];B[ei];W[dg]
(;B[lf]C[Immediatly after playing k15 (move 50), I did feel that this is a very weak shape, so I wanted to return as soon as possible the strengthen it. Did this move make sense? k14, k16 and l16 where my other options. I chose this, because I was mainly afraid about an attack on the group around i44. (Now slowly realizing that I found an rather aggressive (at least for my taste) opponent.

D: I would recommend taking out W's eye.
Hint - W has to be agressive in handicapped games.];W[cg];B[ci]
;W[hh]C[D: W settled his group.];B[qf]C[D: Hmm?
If you want to protect corner, do it directly.
By the way, there is lot of unplayed space on the board.

!Check it...];W[kg];B[kf];W[kd]
(;B[id];W[md]
(;B[nf]C[In the game I was quite confident that k16 and m16 wouldn't live and therefore I'm trying to cut their way out to the middle. Was this assessment completly wrong?

D: Assesment is correct if you limit W's possibilities. That's why there is proverb "connect your stones, cut opponent's"]
;W[ne];B[ld];W[kc];B[lc];W[mf];B[mg];W[me]
(;B[lg]C[D: Not important. O13 is the key cutting point here.]

(;B[pf];W[mc];B[mb];W[le]SQ[lc][ld]LB[me:A][kd:B]C[D: Your two cutting stones are in atari now. It cuts two marked groups]

(;B[oe];W[lb];B[ob];W[nd];B[nb];W[pe]
(;B[jc];W[jb]C[D: W widens it's eyespace.];B[ib];W[ja];B[ia]
;W[la];B[qb]C[D: unnecessary];W[oe]C[After this sequence in the after-game analysis I still cannot really point out the move where I could/should have stopped white's extension? I guess l16 was already a bad start?

On the other hand I was thinking that I have the corner secured, while white did not gain too much outside influence to the middle. I thought my group around L13 was reasonably save and therefore it was not a too bad an exchange.]

(;B[mh]C[I did play this to prevent being cut at N12.

D: P10 protects more cutting points.];W[fn];B[el];W[qi];B[ri]
TR[oj]C[D: Creating even more cutting points is a bad idea.
See previous comment. Marked cutting point is important.];W[oj]
;B[nj];W[ok];B[nk];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh]C[Starting from R11 (move 112), how should I have played this differently. Sequences similiar to this one will happen a lot more through this game, and I have the feeling, that this was my main weakness: Bad responses to "aggressive" cuts. Would you aggree?
(Maybe white is not even playing aggresscive, but that's how it felt for me)]
;B[kh]TR[mj][rh][rj]C[D: marked points are cutting points. It's consequence of S11 move.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[rj];B[sh];W[si];B[sg];W[qk];B[qh];W[ri];B[nm]
C[I'm still thinking about making some territory in the middle, so I try to establish a loose framework. Also, I'm afraid that if white played here and/or around M5, the white territory in the corner would be rather huge and I would not have a good idea on how to invade.

Threre's not much territory in middle. I would think of direct invasion or reduction.]

D: you are correct. W's right is much bigger that your center. Reducing W would be better.]

D: see comments for previous moves.];W[eq];B[eo];W[dr];B[cr]
;W[ds];B[cs]C[At this point in the game I have still the feeling, that it's quite balanced and that I have a good chance to win. What do you think about this assessment? Is it anywhere near realistic?

I guessed that the black territory on the lower left and white's on the lower right are about equal, while black has in addition some bigger territory in the upper region.

D: It is. Loss of upper right corner costed you arounf 60 of final difference.]
;W[er];B[gp];W[gq];B[dh];W[ep];B[do];W[ma];B[na];W[rd]C[I was quite sure that this invade could not succeed...]
;B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[sc]C[D: just connect stones. W cant' live like this.]

(;B[re];W[qc];B[se];W[qa]
(;B[rc]C[I was quite happy about finding this move and thought I was save. But then it was the first time that I encountered in a Ko-Fight.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[qc]
(;B[lo]C[After realizing how it works, I tried the same thing, but apperently (and rightful so), the loss of a 3 stone group is much less valueable to white than the loss of the corner...

D: san-san invasion would serve as good source of ko-threats.
Then again, simple connection is the key.];W[pb];B[sd];W[rc]
;B[ko]C[How could I have played the fight over the upper right corner differently?
And a more abstract question: How can I get better at this kind of gameplay? Solving L&D problems? If I try to analyze this part of the game on my own and try out different moves for myself I usually have the problem that my alternatives for white are not the best moves available, so I often find better moves, but I'm quite sure that the "real white" would have played smarter? Any solution for that problem? Maybe playing from such a setting against a bot?

D: Solving problems is a good way to improve. It helps to graps principles like controlling eyespace, keeping eye on cutting points, connecting and cutting.
These concepts are key, especially now.];W[jp];B[in];W[oa];B[fi]

D: Yes, it was close until lose of upper right.
Concentrate on cutting and connecting principles, these are the ones that made final difference in this match.]
