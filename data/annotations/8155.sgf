C[Hi,
firstly thanks in advance for taking your time to review this for me.

Recently I've noticed that in many of my games when I've lost, I don't really know why. It seemed as if my opponent was doing what I wanted them to do yet result, it seems was disadvantageous for me. I this review, if you could, I would like to know where in my basic attacking strategy am I going wrong, where I should play instead and if you would be so nice to also show me some ways to attack more effectively. I've sort of read the 'Attack and Defense' book but it seems hard to find similar positions in my own games.

And finally after all that, I was white in this game.

Hello!

I am Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL, on KGS and in most other online go places.

To find out how to attack in the right way is a long road, on which we all are travelling. To become better at it, you must study every area of knowledge in go: life and death, tesuji, shape, and so on. Most of all it is a matter of experience. But I will try as well as I can to point out some basic things which hopefully will help you on your way.

The main thing that is necessary for you now is to learn about the "business" side of go - what is it that you get, and what do you give for it?

I will explain with many examples.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd]
(;W[dq]C[Hon: First of all, before you can fight, you must build up a strong position in the fuseki. You can not attack, where you are not strong. But in this game you are white, and with this move you go for a rather patient game, relying on accumulating points here and there and reducing black's influence later.]
;B[do]TR[cd]C[Hon: The reason is, that black can play a corner approach that at the same time develops from his own stone.]
(;W[dm]C[Hon: You pincer him. And although that is not impossible, a pincer normally works better when the stone in the upper left is white, not black.]
(;B[cq];W[cp]LB[cm:A]C[Hon: I have never seen this variation, just had to look it up at kogo's myself. :-)


I am not really strong enough for joseki science, but I will try my best to find some alternatives.]
;B[dp];W[bq];B[cr];W[eq]
(;B[co];W[bp]
(;B[br];W[bo]C[Hon: Good spot.]
(;B[em]
(;W[cn]C[Hon: Yes, of course playing it safe is enough. If you capture the corner stones and stand on both sides, it will be a good result for you.]
;B[en]
(;W[gp]C[at this point i think i was doing better than black

Hon: But the sequence that follows is not bad for black I think.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[dk];B[el];W[bk];B[cj];W[bm]LB[ci:A][ej:B]
C[Hon: Black acquired a lot of strength and has sente.

If we go back to your initial question - why do I get no convincing result, although he did what I wanted - we have to look at the local result from a neutral point. What did both players get in this sequence?

White has got something like 20 points in the corner. That in itself is not so bad, but also no terrific win. (Compare 2nd variation.)

White has started to develop on the lower side, but on the left side he is rather subdued. There will be a tesuji at A later though, if black does not do anything here now. But as it is, black has got a wall in the center, which combines not too bad with his two other stones. Let's say he captures with B now, his stones have just started to make a moyo.

All in all, white has got more profit than he should have had, but black has not been owned here. At least on our level this would not yet decide the game.]
(;B[go]C[Hon: This move is totally pointless. He strengthens you for no reason.]
;W[hp];B[op]
(;W[mq]C[Hon: I think, this pincer is a bit pointless, because you extend from a strong group. 

We always want to play away from living groups. If you go from here, black might just give you what you want, and you end up with 40 or 50 points in the lower left - but nothing else. meanwhile black develops in every other place. When a group is solid, it is important to play somewhere else, away from it.]
;B[kq]C[Hon: Your answer for this move will show, if you have understood the meaning of the tight low pincer or not.]
(;W[mo]C[Hon: I think, this may be possible, but you can do easier.]
;B[ko];W[iq]C[Hon: This move is way too slow. You play once more from your living group.]
;B[on];W[qn];B[mn];W[oq];B[pq];W[pp];B[nq]
(;W[oo];B[or];W[no];B[mr]C[Hon: Like this black gets the points in the corner, and your group is not yet completely settled.]
;W[np];B[lq];W[oq];B[mp];W[pr];B[op];W[qq];B[oq]LB[nc:B][ed:A]
C[Hon: Okay, so far you have become solid again in the corner, that is alright. But you must now watch out, that his influence does not grow anymore. The group is alive - so just tenuki and play something on the upper side.]
;W[nn];B[mm];W[nm];B[nl];W[ol]
(;B[lo]C[Hon: Strange.];W[nk]C[Hon: Good.];B[ml]
(;W[om];B[mk]C[Hon: Again, strange, pushing you like this.]
;W[nj];B[id]TR[ok][pk][qk][rk][sk][pl][ql][rl][sl][pm][qm][rm]
[sm][on][pn][rn][sn][po][qo]C[Hon: Including your opponents fault, you have got around 20 more points here, in gote. Also you have increased your influence. Locally it is a great result for you. But black has also got something - he has played first on the upper side.]
(;W[ph]C[Hon: This is terrible ...];B[qf]C[Hon: ... and your opponent punishes you right away.]
;W[qh]TR[pi][qi][ri][si][oj][pj][qj][rj][sj]C[i think my move here might have been a little too passive. if you think so too could you suggest some better moves with follow up moves? because a lot of the time when i invade deeply i either die or hurt my own territory

Hon: Again the problem is to calculate, what BOTH players get. You have increased your position by 9 points in gote (a medium-sized endgame), while your opponent got in R6 for free.

Invading and thereby losing territory is not necessarily a catastrophy - you get something, you lose something. If you shun away from invading and instead add stone on stone to your already alive groups, you will just take one bite at a time, and let the opponent have two bites, without any fight.]
;B[nd]LB[oc:A]C[Hon: Should be rather at A to enclose the corner. He will have something around 17 points in the corner then - a total plus, compared with your 9 points. Also he will develop the upper side.]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[li];B[ki];W[lh];B[kj]
(;W[in]TR[iq]C[maybe this was a little early, i probably could have done something on the top first, but again I guess I played there because i didn't know what I could do on the top

Hon: From the flow it was logical - you first give him some more influence, so afterwards you have more reason to play J6. The problem is, that you overconcentrated yourself already. too much.

The marked stones have increased your corner somewhat, and reduced the black influence somewhat. But since you have played too cramped on the right side, the black wall - in relation to your group and the moves he got on top and in the upper right - has not to do so much to obtain an at least equal result.]
;B[ec]C[Hon: A very large point.];W[ce]
(;B[de];W[cf]
(;B[df];W[bd]C[Hon: Good.];B[cg];W[cc];B[dd];W[bg];B[bh];W[bf]
;B[ch]
(;W[bb]C[this is probably too small since I was losing

Hon: The corner seems alive without, so yes.];B[kh];W[hm];B[gl]
;W[ik];B[lg];W[nh];B[rg]C[Hon: Game over. So - end of review.

I think my main problem, particularly in this game is where and when to invade, this is probably out of the scope of this game but in many of my games where I have invaded and lived, i looked back wondering if i should have invaded at all, my invasion cut off my potential reducing places and it lived small and heavy. Also I don't know if this helps but in most of the games I've lost without a fairly large area dying, it's been about 5 - 15 moku.

and of course, thanks again for this review

Hon: If invasion is necessary, do not hesitate. In positions where you are behind, there is no other choice, so dive right in and try your best. If you want to improve your survival skills, practice tesuji and life-and-death problems.

But what is more important - get more experience with the trading matter. Whenever you play something, try to evaluate, what both players get, and who is better off. But don't think like - Yes, I got a good result, so I won! But rather try to find out, if you have a slightly better result, a better result, a promising result, or if the result means total ownage of your opponent. 

In this game, there were many places where you did not get that much more, and in some places you even got a lot less than your opponent. So this is what you must work at.

First, you got to try this in every game with every move - evaluate the local result for both sides. To practice that and get into this kind of thinking more, two things are good.

- Study the endgame (there are some good books). You got to learn to know the exact value of a move, otherwise you can not determine if it's worth playing it now.

- Study a joseki dictionary (of course that takes a bit longer). Because in joseki, again and again this kind of evaluation is done - who is better, and why, and by how much, so you will get a better feeling for it.

Good luck on your journey!];W[rh];B[sh];W[si];B[sg];W[rj];B[hi]

(;W[pf]C[maybe i should have gone deeper here? or maybe there are problems with my previous moves

Hon: Your previous moves were okay. But it is again the problem: You got to watch out not to become overconcentrated. The lower right is a large territory, and totally alive, so it is not really necessary to play from there. IF you play from there, then with the maximum effect.]

So you acquired about 18 more points in gote, but you also gave black a corner of 13 points, so your move did not add SO much to your position down there and rather helped black.]

With your push at O6 you will capture P6 for an additional profit of maybe ten or so points, but is it really worth it, if black gets more strength in the center?]

You can go on with the fuseki, something like A or B, and have a good game.

Just like you should not have played from your living group, he should not play close to your living group. Living groups should be avoided by both players!
