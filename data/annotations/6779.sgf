C[My name is Tim (Talaer on KGS) and I will be reviewing this game for you. Sorry for the delay in the review. I hope that it will be helpful for you. Let me know if you have any further questions about anything in this game and I can get with you to answer them. If you like, we can play a game on KGS sometime. Feel free to email me at goclub@comcast.net. I will mark my comments as T:

Thanks,
Tim


wodka88 [?\]: hi^^
Kraeftchen [8k\]: hi there
Kraeftchen [8k\]: good game :)

W: Hello Reviewer, I will mark my comments as W:
Background: This was my very first game since a long time not playing. I am ~ 8kuy on KGS and playing here White.

Thx for reviewing this];B[pd]C[wodka88 [?\]: u2];W[dp]C[Kraeftchen [8k\]: thanks ^^]
;B[pq]C[wodka88 [?\]: im new so be soft :P];W[dd];B[fc];W[df]
C[Kraeftchen [8k\]: when did you start playing go?];B[jd]C[wodka88 [?\]: i played a while ago 1 year maybe]
;W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[no]
(;W[qq]C[T: I do not have a strong knowledge of joseki, so I consult with www.eidogo.com. This move is not listed as a joseki and should instead be played as Q4 or Q7.

W: Up to this point standard but here I think i butchered the joseki]
;B[pp];W[qp];B[pn];W[qo];B[pm]C[T: This fight feels favorable for black. It feels like he can get some influences that will work well with his 4th line stones at the top.]
;W[pr]
(;B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[nq]C[Kraeftchen [8k\]: well, since I'm doing pretty dumb mistakes you won't have any trouble here ^^]
;B[op];W[mr]C[T: This is definitely a bad result for black and he has lost his opportunity to get the most out of this corner. I will try some variations to see what else might have happened.


W: Well nice result for White but do I still get a good result if Black dont do mistake?]

(;B[fq]C[T: B is attacking near an already shaky position, this cannot go well for him.]

(;W[hq];B[fo];W[dn];B[ip]C[T: I recommend reviewing this joseki when you have time because it has many variations and is somewhat complicated. What you would like to avoid is having B make his right side stronger while also improving the position for these stones locally. Unfortunately, most of the variations at this point stem out to B reaching over to those right side stones.

With that knowledge, perhaps it would have been better to play a high pincer stone, instead.]
;W[hp]
(;B[io]C[T: Consulting eidogo.com again, this is not a correct move. B should play at H5.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[fn];B[gp]
(;W[eo]C[W: Direction alright?];B[ho]C[T: B has a strong position here now]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[mq];W[ns];B[ir];W[kq];B[jp];W[hr];B[is]
;W[kr];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]C[T: Probably better to D10 immediately as you are not threatening to kill B with B2, and it is not large enough yet.]
;W[br];B[gr];W[hs];B[fm]C[T: Hard to say if tenuki was right for this move. It would be a question of how dangerous the cut at G7 would be for black. At this time, I think black could handle that cut just fine, so maybe tenuki is fine as well.]
;W[cj];B[ch];W[dh];B[cl]C[T: You cannot expect to get the entire left side, so you should choose a portion to give to black. If the bottom left can live, I think that maybe a move such as C11 could be good here.]

(;W[dl];B[bj]C[W: How to respond to this kind of invasion?]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[bi];B[dj];W[ci];B[di];W[dk];B[bh];W[aj];B[ce]
;W[cg];B[de];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[bd];W[ec];B[eb];W[ee];B[dc]
;W[bf];B[ed]C[T: I think that maybe losing this corner is an acceptable loss for the large gain on the left side.

Where did I go wrong in losing the corner?];W[cd];B[be];W[fd]
;B[ec];W[fe];B[bc];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[hc];W[ej];B[ei];W[fj]
;B[ah];W[cm];B[cf]
(;W[dg];B[bg];W[gh];B[je];W[if];B[jf];W[qf]SQ[qc][rm]C[T: Black's territory is already open on this side, so possibly it is a better choice to invade the corner. Also should possibly begin thinking about finding a way to exploit black's weaknesses in the lower right area.

W: If I look back J13 is more important here];B[qh];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[pj];W[rm]C[T: All good for W. Now black has to secure a large amount of points in the center to win.]

Kraeftchen [8k\]: no seki, what a pity
wodka88 [?\]: ahhh
Kraeftchen [8k\]: lol
wodka88 [?\]: ty
Kraeftchen [8k\]: that would look much better for me ^^

Kraeftchen [8k\]: and great play
wodka88 [7k?\]: im back xD

Kraeftchen [8k\]: see you :)
