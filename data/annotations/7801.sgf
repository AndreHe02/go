C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my Game.  I lost this game and I'd like some advice.  I resigned because I made a big reading error and died :(.  I don't play much online and had a hard time finding a game because no one would play me because I had a '?' for my rank.  Can you give me an idea of what my rank might be please?  I was Black.

DanielTom (DT) - Hello, I am the reviewer.
You can find a list of advice at the end of the game, as well as my estimation of your level.
Enjoy the review.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[do];B[oq];W[lp];B[dq]
C[I didn't want W to get that nice corner enclosure with an extension.  Right thought?  I felt anything else might not give me sente to play this move if W decided to play out of Joseki

DT - Excellent thought.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[fr]LB[fq:A]C[I didn't know this sequence in the corner.

DT - This is actually a basic joseki. Black A instead is also possible. You should get used to study the new moves (which you didn't know how to answer) that appear in your games by yourself (maybe using a database or a joseki book).]
;W[cq];B[dr]C[Would C2 be better?

DT - They are both fine.]
(;W[gq]LB[cp:A]C[DT - This move is risky. White A would be normal.]
(;B[iq]LB[cp:B][gq:A]C[Well since I was sealed in the corner, I played this as a probe to see what W would do and create some more aji in W area.

DT - This "probe" is damaging. I think you should just take the corner with B (huge).]
;W[gr];B[cp];W[co];B[bq];W[hp]
(;B[dj]LB[dj:B][ql:A]C[Took away white's big extension. J3 still not completely dead either.  Still aji, right?

DT - Of course there is still aji, but you have to agree your J3 stone is in a bad place. However, you can come up with a good plan here that can make the game look very good for you. See variation (Black A instead of B).]
;W[ed]LB[fc:B][dj:A]C[DT - With a stone around A, usually White is playing more carefully (at B, for instance).]
(;B[hc]LB[ec:D][gd:B][hd:A][df:C]C[Was this right?  I was debating between this move and D14.

DT - I think this pincer is rather strange, but I can't say it is bad. The normal kind of pincers in this position would be high (A or B), but you don't actually have to play a pincer. The move you suggested, C, is fine. I would also think about playing D. These are all good moves.]
;W[cc]C[I think this was a mistake by W would C15 help him use his thickness on the lower side to attack D10 in the future?

DT - This move is okay...];B[bc];W[dc]
(;B[cf]LB[be:A]C[DT - Very bad! You want to keep attacking White, so don't give him a base so easily! Black A would be much better. This is really basic, be sure to see if you understand it - see variation.]
;W[bb]C[DT - Black failed.];B[be]LB[ac:B][cf:A]C[DT - Your A stone looks silly now. And White atari at A is really painful... Please be sure that you comprehend  this before you move on.]
;W[ac];B[qm]LB[hc:B][ch:A][qm:C]C[I didn't think that Ko was big at the moment.

DT - White's gain on the top left corner is clear (don't forget you had two stones in that area first...). Your stone at B looks weird now and later you will have to worry about the weakness at A.
Your move C is the correct direction.];W[op]
(;B[np]LB[qj:A]C[DT - It is better to take sente by playing A - see variation.]
;W[oo];B[pq];W[qq]
(;B[mq]LB[mp:A]C[DT - Black A instead is the proper shape.]
;W[lq];B[no];W[nn];B[mn]C[Was this too agressive?

DT - It is okay because White can't cut.]
(;W[mo]LB[nm:A]C[DT - This is an overplay. White should have simply extended at A.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[pp];W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[qn];W[on]
(;B[qr]C[I think I maybe should have forced at N4 first then R2.

DT - N4 would be terrible - see variation.];W[rr];B[pr];W[nr]
C[Did I handle this correctly?

DT - It is hard for White to do something here.];B[mr];W[lr]
(;B[rs]C[Was killing the corner good?

DT - No, because the corner is already dead. There is no need to kill it twice You should have played N1 instead - see variation.]
;W[nq]C[DT - The result is very bad for Black...];B[rq];W[qf]
(;B[ph]LB[qc:5][nd:3][rd:4][qe:A][of:2][ph:1][rh:6]SQ[pm][qm]
C[Maybe this pincer wasn't the right choice.  What do you think?

DT - I agree just by thinking of the most common joseki (1 to 6).
If you wanted to pincer, a low pincer might have been better. However, I am not sure whether you should pincer here. I don't know if I can call the marked stones "thickness", but if you consider that they are, the usual move here would then be A - see variation.]
;W[nc]C[DT - This move is usually bad.];B[pf]
(;W[pe]LB[qc:A]C[DT - A new move (seems an overplay to me). Usually White has to invade at san-san (A).]
;B[oe];W[qe]
(;B[od]LB[qd:A]C[DT - A player with good fighting spirit would play at A without much thought, and it in this case it works much better (because it fills one of White's group few liberties).
The difference is clear if you look at the variation.];W[pg]
LB[od:A]C[DT - Now A looks really awkward.];B[of];W[og];B[qh]
LB[od:A]C[Good punishment?

DT - This is the vital point. But I don't think this is the best punishment - see variation for move A.]
;W[qg];B[qd];W[kc]LB[oh:A]C[DT - White A is the gentle way.]
(;B[md]LB[ob:A][cm:B]TR[co][do]SQ[ch][ck]C[Now that I think about it, this wasn't good.  My original plan was to  lean on O17 to attack on Q15 group but he has too many ways to get into the center or push at P12.  Should I have protected my corner first, taking gote and then see what W does?  I was also thinking of C7 too, but I think that would be too greedy.

DT - Maybe I agree with you when it comes to taking the corner (let's say with A) and wait to see how White answers. But your idea of a leaning attack is interesting if you know how to make it work.
What worries me is that you considered playing B, which is not so good. White's marked stones are strong, so Black B would only make your weaknesses (marked) look even more threatening.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[jc]C[DT - Weak shape!];B[ni];W[oh];B[oi];W[mg]
(;B[mh]LB[lc:A]C[I think this is whre things went down hill.  I was too greedy and eager to get W.  Maybe my variation would be better?

DT - The actual big mistake is in your next move...
(Knowing you missed the cut, I added my own variation on the leaning attack, starting with Black A).]
(;W[lh]LB[nf:A]C[DT - Very bad! White A was the only move.]
(;B[li]LB[lg:A]C[DT - I just can't understand this move. Why were you helping White?
Cutting at A was the only move (it would probably kill White) - see variation.
You lost a big chance here...];W[nh];B[mi];W[kg]C[I failed.]
;B[nf];W[ng];B[lf];W[lg];B[je];W[ki]
(;B[fe]C[What would be a good move here?  I like C7 because it's sente because of B5.

DT - Strange shape. And I have already commented on C7.
I added a possible variation for Black.];W[id];B[he]C[DT - Weak shape again... You can't let these two White groups connect...]
;W[ie];B[if];W[jf];B[kf];W[jg];B[hf];W[ke]C[DT - ...]
(;B[mf]C[DT - Very bad! These stones are not important at all! See variation.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[pc];B[qc]
(;W[nd]LB[bj:A]C[DT - Either way White will end in sente and play A to finish the game. The game looks really hard for Black.]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[re];W[rf]
(;B[rd]LB[oc:A]C[Big stupid mistake.  This should have been at T15 I think.  Well the game is pretty much a tragedy and a shame from here

DT - No, I don't think T15 would work. I corrected the move in your variation for T15.
Anyway, because of the weakness at A, I think it is hard for White to kill your group.]
;W[rb]C[I messed up big time and didn't see the Ko at the time.  You don't have to look at the game from here, it's disappointing.  So, what general advice do you have?  What did I do right?  What did I do wrong?  Don't forget to give me and idea of how strong I am, thanks.

DT - Indeed there is at least a ko for Black here.]
(;B[ra]C[DT - Well, this is the final mistake. See variation.]
;W[sb];B[le];W[ne];B[kd];W[jd];B[ke];W[jb];B[ob];W[oc];B[pa]
;W[nb]C[DT - So let us see the main lessons you can take from this game.

1st - When you see that your opponent has played all stones in the same side (which is usually bad in Go), try to come up with a plan to take advantage of it (see my variation for move 21, D10).
2nd - When you are attacking a group, don't let it make a base so easily as you did in the game (Move 27, C14). This is really important, and it is about basic shapes. Be sure to study that position once again.
3rd - Don't help your opponent, giving him good shape and letting him get away! Finish the game right away by cutting your opponent's weak group off (see variation for move 87, M11). You lost a big chance to kill White's group there.
4th - Don't play weak shapes and don't let your opponent connect his groups so easily! (See what happened after move 97, F15).
5th - Forget about the stones that are not important at all and that are really small. See move 107, N14, where you played a really slow (and small) move that got your group killed. It was better to take the corner.
6th - Do some basic life and death problems (maybe for 15k-20k) to get a better understanding of basic shapes that often appear in your games and to improve your reading.

You asked me to estimate your rank but that is really hard for me to do based on only a single game... I hope you won't feel disappointed when I say that your rank must be somewhere around 5 kyu on KGS. It may well be that you are stronger than that, I simply can't tell for sure... You can prove me wrong by playing some more games to get a solid rank :)

I hope this review was helpful. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to email me: danielfacto@gmail.com
