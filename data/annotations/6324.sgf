AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello, My name is Christoffer Andr√® Nilsen. (KGS 9kyu - TheBeast)
This is a teaching game: Teacher 9dan and Thebeast 9kyu

Rules:
i.) No time limit
ii.) 9Handicap
iii.) 0,5komi

Since this is a teaching game, the Teacher does some moves that is to test me.

Where I write look at exaple you can see how it sould been played out or not.
But there is other here that is not is important.];W[nc];B[oc]
TR[jd][dj][pj][jp]C[I like this move when it is a 9Handicap game.
Because of the marked stones, without the marked stones, this move would be lesser good.]
;W[nd];B[pf]LB[pe:A][qf:B]C[This move is to protect the weakness at (A).
You can also do (A) and (B) to protect this weakness and to get locked inside the corner.]
;W[gd];B[jf]LB[ic:A][df:B]C[I like this move, now I make pressure on O16/O17 group and G16.
(A) and (B) can also be done.];W[dg];B[fe]LB[ef:A]TR[jd][jf]
C[This is the best answer locally (This is a perfect move)
Now Black can both escape and cut the connection between G16 and D13.

I like F15 better then (A) because of the help from marked stones.]
;W[ie];B[je]TR[nc][nd]C[Connect is fine, and I wont get a cut against me.  and there become more pressure on O16/O17group.]
;W[gf];B[ff]LB[fg:A]TR[dg]C[With this move I wanted to make pressure on Marked stone. And dont let white connect. Since I can still Cut if he Hane at (A).]
;W[fg];B[ge]LB[hf:B][gg:A]C[With this move black get ready to cut either (A) or cut at (B) if he do (C).
Can also Hane at B if he connects at (A)];W[he];B[gg]C[Now Black did the cut that he made ready.
Now White got two weaks group.  Ready to get attacked.];W[hf]

(;B[eg]LB[fd:A]TR[gg]C[This is a mistake by black.
Marked stone can not be captures anyway, so this atarti is wrong.
The right way would be (A).];W[fh];B[eh]LB[ef:A]C[This move is almost the only move after the Atari mistake.
With this move black protects the dubble atari at (A) and];W[ef]

(;B[fd]LB[ee:A]C[This was also a bad move by black.
Atari at (A) would be the right move, and white would be very weak with 3groups.

"Look at the example what would be right"];W[de]
(;B[ee]LB[ed:A]C[This was also a mistake by black, and (A) would be right.
But this move also protect what is showed in one of the examples. 
See both examples to see why (A) would be right];W[df];B[gc]
LB[eg:B][gg:A][eh:C][ei:D]TR[gd][he][ie][gf][hf]C[This was wrong by black again. Marked stones is allmost dead, and white have abandon them, if not black does a very big mistake and they can live easy.

Since (A) cant be captures marked stones is very weak.  But since (B) and (C) is very weak (D) would be the right move for black]
;W[cd]
(;B[hd]LB[ei:A]TR[eg][eh]C[This was also wrong, Marked stones still needs to get protected and that sould be done with (A)]
;W[ei];B[dh]LB[di:A]TR[cd][de][df][ef][dg]C[I think all most of the moves Black does in this groups fight is wrong.
The main reason black did this move was because he read wrong, and thought black would protect the marked group, and then black could connect at (A)]
;W[di];B[ch]TR[cd][de][df][ef][dg]C[Also a mistake by black, black still read wrong, and thought white would proctect white's group.]
;W[ci]
(;B[gh]CR[he][ie][gf][hf]LB[fi:A]TR[eg][ch][dh][eh]C[Black could still live with the marked stones, but he abandoned it. since white would be to strong.
Now black wanted to to force white to block at (A) and have a easyer job to kill the other marked group.]
;W[fi]
(;B[ih]LB[ig:A]C[This was also to just get out of truble.
But this is a wrong shape, (A) would be better for Black.]
(;W[cn]
(;B[cl]LB[fq:A]C[This was also a mistake by black, the reason he did it was because he thought/hoped white would do (A). 
See example what black hoped white would do.]
(;W[en];B[fp]TR[dj][cl]C[Since white did not do what black whated black abanded marked stones.]
;W[fl];B[el]LB[dn:A]TR[fl][cn][en]C[This move was just to se if black could do anything, he did not thought he could escape, but he hoped to get a cut at (A) and get one of the marked stones in the exchange.]
;W[ek];B[ej]LB[fj:B][dk:A]C[This move was done so black could atari with (A), if white blocks black at (B)]
;W[fj];B[dk]LB[dl:A]C[Now white needs to protect the atari, and black have (A) where white cant move.]
;W[fk];B[dn]C[With this move black wanted do get something from the exchange, but if this was a good exchange is not sure. since white killed the group, and got a wall.]
;W[dm];B[do]LB[cm:A][em:B]C[Needs to protect the atari, and now black got two cuting points. (A) and (B)]
;W[cm];B[em]LB[dm:A][en:B]C[Now white cuts, and white can choose to keep either A group or B.]
;W[dl];B[fm]LB[dm:A][en:B]C[white choose (A) group, and black gets (B)]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[gn];B[fo];W[qn]
(;B[ql]LB[nq:A]C[I think this is a small mistake for black, and (A) would been better.
And more normal, I cant explain why black did this move.];W[on]
;B[no]LB[np:A]C[This is maybe alitle overplay by black but a okey move. (A) would been better]
;W[kc]
(;B[jc]C[With this move black just want to block white from go above him.]
;W[jb];B[ib]LB[kb:A]C[Same as last move black did, black and make a cut treath at (A)]
;W[mg];B[kd]LB[nd:A][mg:B]C[This was a bad move, because of the shape, but this move was done because black wanted to cut the connect between (A) and (B).
The bad shape is: empty triangle, K16+K15+L16];W[lc];B[nf]LB[nd:B]
[mg:A]C[With this move Black wanted to cut (A) and (B), and it can be done.]
;W[mf];B[me]LB[kd:B][me:A]C[This was to get connected (A) and (B).]
;W[ne];B[md]LB[ld:A][of:B]C[This was to push white.
Black will still alive of white attack at (A), but black still got weakness at (B)]
;W[of];B[ng]C[This move was because the ladder does not work, and black does not wanna lose the connection he just did.]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[oe]
(;B[pg]LB[qc:C][qd:A][qf:B]C[This move was to protect Blacks weakness at (A) and (B).
But white can still invade at (C)];W[og];B[nh]C[Same reason again. did not want to loose the connection]
;W[ph]
(;B[qc]LB[qc:C][qd:A][qf:B]C[This was bad by black, the best move would been (A), this protect the cut on (B) and (C) invasion]
;W[oh];B[ni]TR[pj][ql]C[Did not wanna get in a ladder, and let marked stones get weak.]
;W[qf]
(;B[rf]LB[re:A]C[With this move Black abanded marked stones, but still (A) would been a better stone]
;W[qg];B[se]LB[qc:B][re:A][rf:C]C[Now (A) would been better, after the (B) and (C) mistake.]
;W[rd];B[sd]LB[qd:A][re:B]C[Now black thought this would been better then block the atari at (A) and (B).
But (A) or (B) would been better.];W[ob];B[pb]C[Just to block again]
;W[od]
(;B[rc]LB[mb:B][pc:A]C[Black was scared of losing the corner, and was passive.
This is wrong.  And (A) would been better.
If black do (A), (B) would been a better stone later.];W[pc]
;B[qd];W[ol];B[pm]LB[om:A][pn:B]TR[ol][on][qn]C[This was a to direct attack against white. Black wanted to cut at (A) or (B), and get one of the marked stones.]
;W[pn];B[om];W[nn];B[nm]LB[ol:A][no:B][pp:C]C[Now black just wanna get out of problem with (A).
But the negative is (B) and (C) stone is starting to get weak.]
;W[mo];B[mp];W[np];B[nq]LB[pp:B][nq:A]C[This is a very good move by black.  This way white cant cut (A) and (B) connection.]
;W[mm];B[ml]C[Black did this because he did not want black to get inside his territory.]
;W[lp];B[op]C[Black captures the stone.];W[mq];B[np]C[Now white got some weakness.  But black is still weak in the corner]
;W[ll];B[lm]C[This was okey for black];W[mn]
(;B[kl]LB[mk:A]C[This was wrong, and black sould not atari, (A) would been better.]
;W[lk];B[jm]LB[ml:A]TR[kl][lm]C[This was to protect marked stones. But protecting (A) would maybe been better.]
;W[kn];B[km]C[Connecting.];W[nl];B[mk]TR[ml]C[Did not wanna lose marked stone]
;W[qk];B[pl]C[This was also a mistake, but I think the group is dead.]
;W[ok];B[pk]LB[mj:B][nj:A]TR[pj][pl][ql][nm][om][pm]SQ[mk][ml]
C[Now I need to choose either group.
So this move was VERY VERY bad. (A) or (B) had been right.]
;W[mj];B[lj]C[This was just a way to force the capture.];W[nk]
;B[oj]TR[pj][pk][pl][ql][nm][om][pm]C[This move was to protect the marked group, without this group woud be a to big loss.]
;W[li];B[lh]TR[mf][mg]C[This move was very good. Now marked group is still captured.]
;W[kp];B[hq]C[This was just passive. and black wanted to secure some points at the bottom.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[mr];B[rp]LB[nr:A]C[This is okey move. but I think maybe (A) would been the same. But easyer.]
;W[or];B[nr];W[ns];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[oq]C[This is a mistake by black.  Black needed to connect at R4
