AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I am black in this match; although I won comfortably, I feel my play was unnecessarily timid at times and the timing of some crucial moves was rather dubious too.

So, I would like the focus of the review to be on these two points (better attacking and missed big moves). Of course, any other comments are welcome too, for either side.

Thank you very much!

M: Hey I am Moe, I am about 8K KGS.  Anything I say just be taking as that, I am not 100% right on ne thing.   But I hope some of what I say can help you.  Just a side note, generally it's good idea to get games reviewed that you lost.  So what I'll do this game is say where white went wrong and you went wrong.  So bascially reviewing for both sides.

M: Final comments :

1) Big reason white lost was because he played too many small moves.
2) You also played many small moves.
3) You also made few over plays :p  Avoid those.
4) You are being tooo aggrassive, with stronger player that could come back to bite.
5) REMEBER! Urgent before BIG!
6) REMEBER! Attaching is for defending, attack from far away!
7) When you get a chance to split white, it's usually good idea (not always) but usaully in this game like when white played F16, playing E15 would have been very good for you.

Not bad over all keep at it ^_^ You improve quick :D.  Have fun, any questions fire an email back to me. Cya!]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[df];B[dj];W[qf]C[M: This move is a mistake by white the order of moves is Urgent before big ALWAYS!  So white should play something like F10. TO put pressure on C6.  But really it will be hard with having one stone on 4th line and one on 3rd line. But white's goal should be to put pressure on D10 not play an open area.]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qg]C[M: I disagree with this move.  Attaching moves like these should be used for defense or to put pressure on white.  But white can use this move to help him self. Look at the variation.]
