AB[pd][dp]C[pz-  hi! i'm pzykr and i'm 9 kyu (under a different name) on KGS. all my comments will be preceeded with  "pz-" to make them easy to spot and will preceed comments already made.
first thing: please set your .sgf viewer to show all move numbers. for the most part, i will refer to move numbers instead of the board locations of stones (with some exceptions, perhaps). w1 is white's first move, here played on Q4. all board locations will be identified with a CAPITAL letter and a number; all moves will be _lower case_ b or w and the move number.

hope you nJoy/benefit from these comments!];W[pp];B[dd];W[fq]
;B[cj];W[dr];B[cq]C[pz- the most effective defense of this corner is the move played here--the 3-3 point (san-san). playing here earlier was not necessary, would have been slow and small.


_____________________________________________________
Could have black defended the corner?];W[cr];B[bq]C[pz- why not b8 at B2? though not moving in this area would probably have been better, as there are many, many larger points on the board, this passive move yields a couple of points to w. it's too early in the game to worry about a couple of points: find bigger moves! but if one is going to play a small move, at least get the couple of points available...]
;W[jp];B[jc];W[pj];B[pi]C[pz- depending on b's objective, this may be ok or not. if the purpose is to attack w--not so good. the proverb is "do not touch a stone you are attacking." on the other hand, if the purpose is quickly to build thickness or establish a position, then attaching is ok. other possibilities here include invading between w1 and w11; this is worth at least pondering, especially since both w stones have been played "high" (on the fourth line). for example, a b play at R6 would look towards invading w's corner and would also tend to isolate w11. this isolation of w11 is particularly effective since it's on the fourth line and therefore out of position to establish a base by extending two points in either direction.]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[pg];W[nj];B[qg]C[pz- subsequent play after b12 seems to indicate b's strategy was to build thickness and outside influence rather than attack w11. this seems to have worked rather well, though the tradeoff is that w's area between w11 and w1 has become stronger: w now has a moyo in the bottom right. 
when i review games commented by pros they often make comments like "the b stones in the upper right appear a bit overconcentrated" because the ideal distance from a wall two stones high is three spaces, while the b handi stone on Q16 is only two spaces away from the wall b16/b18. this, perhaps, is rather subtle and i only mention it because pros seem to find it important ^_^]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[sh];B[qp]C[pz- much more common to invade the corner at san-san (the 3-3 point---here R3). maybe a good idea to invade here (or maybe a bit premature?) but unless there is a very specific reason ("a special strategy") to deviate from joseki , san-san would be better.]
;W[qo];B[qq];W[pq];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm]C[pz- crawling 2 points on the second line is sufficient to ensure life so long as subsequent play is accurate. crawling on the second line is very small, which is why the second line is called "the line of death." much better than b30 here would have been b30 at Q2.]
;W[rl];B[ql]C[pz- (in response to the question below my comment) absolutely! w has missed any opportunity to abuse b for choosing to invade the corner at b26 (ie, S4 instead of R3), but following joseki with b32 at Q2 is practically the only move.

____________________________________________
Was there a better move for black?];W[pl];B[qk];W[rk];B[pk]
;W[ok];B[pm];W[qj]C[pz- w won by just 6.5 points: this ill-considered sequence by b accounts for up to 6 of the winning points...]
;B[pr];W[or];B[ps];W[os];B[rr]C[pz- obviously the cutting point at R2 had to be protected. using the hanging connection this way leaves a ko threat that could have been avoided by making a solid connection.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[pz- choosing to block from this direction increases the overconcentration of b's forces in the upper right. further, trying to make life here is more challenging for w if b "drives" him into his (b's) strong position. if w is sucessful in making life here it would be small ("small life in the corner"): opportunities for larger terri would be very limited. b46 would have been better played at Q17.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc]C[pz- instead of this b54, what about a play at S17? sure it's great to have w crawling on the second line but the thickness b is building is less impressive because of the thickness he already has with the wall b12/b14.b16... else (not as good, imo--too small!) why not b54 at M18?]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc]C[pz- b should be aware of the aji the move b56 leaves behind because of the cutting point at P16...]
;B[oq]C[pz- good move to take advantage of the weakness left behind when w tenukied here to invade the upper right corner.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[po];B[nr];W[np];B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[mo];B[nn]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[ln];B[mm];W[lo]C[pz- up to here b has abused w for attempting to defend this ladder-like shape by attaching to it. this is a cautionary tale!]
;B[mp]C[pz- better would have been  b74 at N3];W[mq];B[mr];W[lp]
;B[om];W[nl];B[pn];W[ql]C[pz- b80, hoping , i guess, to catch w's stones based on w not seeing what was coming, i not a good idea. never ever depend on you opponent not seeing what you see! this move should have been left as a ko threat. bigger moves were around (see other comments).]
;B[lq];W[mp];B[kr]C[pz- why play on the second line? gives w a chance to take sente, pushes b's position lower...]
;W[kq];B[lr];W[ol];B[on]C[pz- was it so important to save these couple-three stones? doing so allows w to seal b in...eventually, w will connect everything in the center to create a very strong shape. fearing the loss of a couple of stones can blind one to much larger issues and opportunities. creating better b shape in the center, in my opinion, would have been worth a couple of stones. b from b72 to b58 encloses no terri, is in fact a "dongo," which is the japanese word for dumpling, and means a large, heavy shape. yes, it occupies some points that w might otherwise possess, but this shape has much more potential than merely preventing w from occupying 10 points...

it is usually worth the loss of a couple of stones to take sente!]
;W[ll];B[jq];W[kp];B[iq];W[lm];B[ns];W[ml];B[or]C[pz- not sure what is meant in the comment below by "y group." starting at b74, b's play has been too low, too timid, and has cost almost enough points to have decided the game. also, before w completely sealed b in, b had the opportunity to create some cutting points by pushing out from b72. now, w's position is rock-solid and there are no cutting points to threaten or exploit. w's thicknesss (influence) in the center is massive!

_________________________________________________________
Was is worth it for black creating the Y group?];W[hp];B[ip]
;W[hq];B[io]C[pz- good move to take advantage of w's mistaken w99...]
;W[ho];B[in];W[il];B[hn];W[gn];B[hm]C[pz- small move--better would have been b106 attaching to w103 at H8 or playing hane at G7--or playing elsewhere entirely. (for example, what would have ensued had b106 attached to w3 at F4? w would likey respond to the threatened cut at G5, giving b all manner of opportunity of securing the left side. just one idea...) this small move gives w the opportunity to tennuki and seize sente on the left.]
;W[dn];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[em];B[el];W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[fl]
;W[ck];B[dj];W[cl];B[co];W[dq]C[pz- b corner--because of w's sente on the left (see earlier comment) is now perhaps killable, and even if it lives it will be sealed-in and small. b does get some compensation by having established a solid position in the center; b's group poses a counterweight to w's massive thickness in the right middle.]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[do];B[bl];W[ep];B[cp];W[bm];B[am];W[cm]
;B[bk]C[pz- w has been extremely generous here, allowing b to connect the small corner to the center-left forces above...]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[gj];B[fj];W[gk];B[fk];W[gh];B[gi];W[hi];B[fi]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[cf];W[df];B[de];W[ff];B[ef];W[eg];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc];W[id];B[ic];W[hf]C[pz- b's tendency to play small moves that do not jump but rather creep has given w great thickness in the upper left center which complements the w thickness on the bottom right and which dwarfs b's thickness in the upper right. the large top left corner is a plus for b, but this game seems easier for w at this point.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[hc]C[pz- no! pure gote, small (infintesimal!) and unnecessary! the most urgent place to play is the center. extended from the b thickness on the upper right would be the correct strategy here. w17 is like a dagger threatening any possible gains for b in this area.]
;W[ng];B[lf]C[pz- see previous comments, especially the last one

_________________________________________________________
Could have black prevented the large white moyo?];W[ne];B[nh]
;W[mh];B[og];W[nf];B[ke]C[pz- the cut at N13 looks HUGE, but the weakness at P16 is bigger. urgent before big! neither player seems to notice the vital cut at P16. as for b70---completely the wrong direction of play!]
(;W[je];B[jd];W[kf];B[jf];W[ie];B[kg];W[ni];B[oh];W[kh];B[oe]
C[pz- *finally* fixed this weakness! had w cut here, very likely b would have died--game over.]
;W[sf];B[se]C[pz- after the cut at P16 was protected the ONLY move here would have been the cut at N13. b182 was not worth any points--just missed an opportunity to make a better play elsewhere!]
;W[sg];B[si]C[pz- another wasted ko threat that was, in the absence of a ko, entirely useless]
;W[rh];B[mg]C[pz- yay! somebody finally noticed the importance of this vital point!]
;W[sd];B[me]C[pz- what exactly is the purpose of this move? play NO move without purpose! does w have any eyespace? any potential to make eyespace? any way of breaking through and connecting to safety? suppose w had played at b88--so what? just glancing around at possible other moves---there the cut at D12, there's a hane at K12, there's the creep at J14 (which, as i look at it seems quite rife with danger for w...). one must tear one's eyes away from the local position and consider the whole board---every move!]
;W[qe];B[qf];W[pe];B[pf];W[oi];B[nd]C[pz- wasted move... had w played here b should simply connect at P16. find a bigger, better move!]
;W[lh];B[jg]C[pz- oh my! one of the first proverbs one learns is "avoid the empty triangle." hane at K12 much better---and much better shape]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[mi]C[pz- wasted move--never expect you opponent not to see what you do! after w connects on the next move, a second wasted move in this area is unfathomable! the only time b202 should be played here is as a ko threat!]
;W[ki];B[mj];W[mk];B[ig];W[hg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[if];B[kf]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[fg]C[pz- b has managed to amass a pretty good lead here: only because of the large top left corner... would it have been too much to avoid wasting b218 and maybe making one more move in the upper left to secure the corner? what in the world could have been the possible purpose of b218? it could only have been used as a ko threat, and even then it would have been the wrong move! the hypothetical ko threat should have been from the bottom, ie at F12, so as to avoid the capture of the stone b218.]
;W[fh];B[gg]C[pz- on second thought, the ko threat might well have been played at b218 as b220 is a good follow-up ko threat. however, in the absence of a ko both are *worse* than useless!]
;W[gf];B[ij];W[hl];B[jm];W[jl];B[km];W[kl];B[ii];W[hh];B[hj]
;W[gl];B[jj];W[lj]C[pz- this sequence had no hope of succeeding. granted, it would require reading several moves ahead to see its utter uselessness, so i give credit for fighting spirit]
;B[kj];W[li]C[pz- no credit for wasting another move here; again, could have been saved for a ko threat]
;B[sl];W[sk];B[sm];W[ir];B[jr];W[hr];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[br]
;B[ar];W[bs];B[jo];W[jn];B[kn];W[im];B[ko];W[as];B[aq];W[ia]
;B[jb]C[pz- at this point, according to smartgo's built-in analysis engine, b is ahead by 24.5 points. (a side note--these analysis engines are notoriously unreliable, and moreso earlier in games. in the late stage this game, i would tend to believe smartgo's analysis. however, it cannot be emphasized enough! one should keep a running tally of the score during the entire game. strategy can only be based on accurate information, and no information is more important that "who is winning?" now, one needn't count the entire board after every single move-though one could-but after every major exchange or each engagement one should recount the score. over and over, count!)]
;W[cc]C[an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure! any number of previously played wasted moves could have been played here.
pros in lectures and books emphasize over and again the importance of assessing the whole board. it has been apparent for a long time, now, that b was winning-as i said, mainly because of the large top left corner. playing small moves elsewhere did not shift the balance of this game one iota. but w's invasion here is big, BIG! when one sees one is ahead by far, one does not seek to fight: "rich men do not pick fights." instead, one consolidates the lead, makes only important and necessary defensive moves (like C17!!), and simply tries to close the edges and finish the endgame and get to the end.

__________________________________
How should black defend?];B[cd]C[pz- i cannot say this blocking move is better or worse than blocking on the other side. b has enough thickness here that w should not live. even if w does live, it should be very small. but it is of utmost importance to MAKE NO MISTAKES! carefully consider the implications of each move: read, read, read!]
;W[dc]C[pz- the vital point in the shape is at E18. b must now play here, MUST, or w can live.]
;B[bc]C[pz- the losing move. w gets E18 and lives comfortably.]
;W[bb]C[pz- note that b now getting E18 would not help because the capture at B16 makes life.
