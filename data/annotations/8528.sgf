Hi !

I'm Sisyph 8k on kgs, I will be your reviewer for this game. This is my first review on the GTL !

As asked, I will be reviewing for White (W). My comments begin with some dashes.

This was quite a strange and hard to review game. I hope my comments will help you to improve your Go.

Remember that I'm 8k so I give advices as best as my knowledge, If you have any questions, you can email me :

Until then, it's perfectly symetric ^^];B[qn]C[----------
Black make a kakari* ...


Note: I will try to explicit Japanese go terms as I don't know if you know them. They are widely used so it is useful to know them. I will add a * after them (the first time at least) and put an explanation at the end of my comment. You can go to http://senseis.xmp.net to get more informations.

----------
kakari : corner approach move];W[fc]TR[pc][qn]SQ[dq]C[----------
Here you play tenuki*
There is no problem with that, if the move you play elsewhere is better or more urgent than a local play, for example.

Here you answer a kakari by another kakari on Black opposite corner. It seems ok to me but ...

Black played a kakari that begins to make a zone of influence or moyo* (the two tringle stones) while you have not done the same with your stones (squares). your last stone is more in black zone of influence than black last play is in yours. That's not necessarily bad and I'm not at the level to start discussing fuseki* this early in the game. Nevertheless you have to be aware of such considerations when playing your first stones.

----------
to play tenuki : to not answer last opponent move locally (you play elsewhere)

moyo: a framework, a zone where you have a large influence that can be transformed (eventually) into territory

fuseki: putting stone into an array, beginning of the game, opening part of the game where you put stones to support your strategy.]
;B[df]
(;W[ic]C[----------
This seems ok. A two space jump is the ideal extension from one stone, so it's ok. You can also play at J16 for something less defensive. I have added some simple joseki* I know against the hoshi*. it is useful to understand them.

----------
hoshi: star = 4-4 point

joseki: well some sort of sequence pro agreed upon as being equally good for both sides. There is a lot of them. no need to learn them by heart (at our humble level I mean ^^) but understanding the hows and whys is useful to improve. You can go to http://eidogo.com to study some of them (kogo's josekis dictionnary). What is hard is the good one to choose depending on the global situation.]
;B[qh]
(;W[nc]LB[pe:A][ch:D][co:C][do:B][jp:E]C[----------
I think this move is not good, for several reasons :

1. locally, it is not a strong attack on the black stone. A better local attack will be at A (eve if you have to consider the stone at R12)

2. when black makes a shimari* at Q15 to answer your attack, he gets a lot of sure points and a strong position where you get nothing as black can play M17 to invade. As a consequence, with O4, you create a weak group you will have to defend.

3. looking at the board as a whole, you have better things to do, like closing your own corner with a shimari at B or C for example. Another idea is to attack the D14 group, to build something with your D3 stone like D. You can also begin to build something big with something around E to equal black framework to the right.

----------
shimari: a corner enclosure, a second move in the corner that locks it.]
;B[pe]CR[qc][rc][sc][qd][rd][sd][qe][re][se][qf][rf][sf][rg]
[sg]LB[lc:A]C[----------
Here you see that black secures at least 14 points and as he has a strong position he can afford to attack you at A (M17) or attack your stone to get influence. And if you defend, he gets sente*.

A will start a spliting attck (karami) as it attacks O17 and will threaten J17.

To conclude, O17 was really bad in my humble opinion.

----------
sente: initiative]
(;W[di]LB[ch:A][co:B][do:C][jp:D]TR[nc][pp]SQ[qn]C[----------
This one is questionnable too (in my humble opinion). The general idea of surrounding Black is OK. But ... Well, some rules of thumb to consider when playing a stone :

1. strengthen your weak groups : a weak group will be attacked and your opponent will get something from it, even if he does not kill it.

2. attack your opponent weak groups : for the same opposite reasons. Beware : generally, make your groups strong before attacking opponent weak groups. Attacking from a weak group usually means bad things will happen ^^

3. get big points (oba)

Best moves are those who do 2 (or more ^^) things : If you have a move that attacks an opponent group while enlarging your territory, that's great !

Looking at your move :

1. it does not strengthen one of your group
2. it is not a strong attack, so your opponent can ignore it and get sente (initiative). A better attack might be at C12 (A)
3. it makes no points

Looking at the board :

- you have weak groups : O17 the weakiest (close to a really strong black position) Q4 even if not that weak (black has a stone near it to attack and gain something). D3 is not really weak as you can defend it but it's worth considering its reinforcement, as a shimari will get you big points too.

- black has no real weak groups. You can consider R6 (square) but is on a side where black is strong. D16-D14 can be attacked but not that weak.

- There is big points to take ^^ B, C or D looks like big points to me.

As you played O17, you created a weak group. To be consistent, you should defend it. Of course, it is better to not play O17 in the first place (do I mention O17 is bad ?).]
;B[do]C[----------
There's a lot of possibilities. You can look for some joseki. I have included some variations to give you some hints ...]
(;W[gq]C[----------
Not bad, but seems too easy for black to setlle. I've included a joseki. The idea is that black can threaten to cut you and build massive influence while you get a few points ...]
(;B[cq]C[----------
Well, black should not make a contact move to attack. Contact move are generally for defense.]
(;W[dm]C[----------

Back played a contact move. You usually play a contact move to defend. It seems an error from black has he should attack.

Why is a contact move a defense move ?
My understanding : It's basically because when your opponent play a contact move, each player has 3 liberties. But it is your turn to play. If you play another contact move on the opponent stone, he gets 2 liberties, while you have 3. This way you have the initiative. So I think here you should answer with a contact move. I've tried to give some variations.

By the way, following your idea, C8 might be better as black can not invade at C9 as in the game.]
;B[dp];W[eq]C[----------
Yes, no other move possible I think.];B[dk]C[----------
Ouch, that start a spitting attack (karami), you have to be cautious. Black attacks from a group not that strong. You have to exploit that.]
(;W[fi]C[----------
In my humble opinion, you should get out and attack with D7, as Black D5 group is not settled.]
;B[fk]
(;W[lp]C[----------
No !
Do not play tenuki (elsewhere) when there is an important fight going on ! You have to use D7 !

And your M4 stone is too far from Q4 and G3.];B[qq]C[----------
Black should have captured D7, in my opinion.]
(;W[pr]C[----------
Too submissive. It's better to cut black. See variations.

Generally speaking you should try to get 'good shape'. Here you make a one space jump (tobi) BUT Black has a stone right in front of it, ready to cut you.]
;B[pq]TR[pp][pr]SQ[qq]C[----------
This is bad shape you must avoid it !]
(;W[oq];B[qp];W[op];B[iq]C[----------
Black attacks. You have some threats to get at least one eye, but the thing to to is getting out into the center, while attacking Black weak groups (D5, J3)]
(;W[fo]TR[dm]C[----------
Your general idea is ok. But did you see the shape ? Black wil cut and get D7, while attacking your group.]
;B[en]
(;W[qk]C[----------
Nooooooo !
You are under attack. And your move does not really threaten black !
You can not leave that way. Playing tenuki is ok, but you can do that

- if you think the local sequence is over
- if you are safe, meaning that even if Black plays first you can defend.
- if you have a bigger move / threat elsewhere

Even if D7 is dead, it have some aji* (potential to exploit). You can for example use it toget your G3 group out or something. In any case, you have to strenghten your weak groups remember ? Doing that while attacking White would be great no ?

Try something like H4. See variations.


----------
aji: hard to define. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?aji];B[ec]
;W[fe];B[kc]C[----------
Finally, Black attacks your WEAK O17 stone.]
(;W[ne]C[----------
Try to push the invader against one of your strong group (a wall is useful for that ^^)

This move is not bad but black can split and attack (karami)]
;B[ho]C[----------
Well black loves to tenuki too ^^
He has listen to me ^^
He attacks your weak groups.]
(;W[jj]TR[qh][qn]C[----------
Again, do not leave an important fight !
Its'ok to sacrifice groups, if you can get a compensation. But getting the center will be hard if not imppossible. And nevertheless, if you lose the whole lower left corner, the center will not be enough.

And it is open because of the triangle stones ...

Better to try to get out with G6 or something like that.];B[gr]
C[----------
Black's mistake, he should not play a contact move to attack you.]
;W[hr]C[----------
Ok ....];B[fr]
(;W[ir]C[----------
Thi move probably cost you your group (and the game)

Keep things simple. H3 is better. You have C3 to defend and you can go out with G6. It is hard to kill you. With White J2, there is too many weaknesses for Black to exploit.

A fundamental is to connect your stones and to disconnect your opponent's.]
;B[fq]C[----------
Ouch, that hurt's ! I think you can not do anything, but save some stones. In any case Black got too much here.]
;W[gn]C[----------
Certainly too late. Good idea, but too late ^^
You can not leave that many weaknesses ...];B[hn];W[hp];B[fp]
(;W[jq]C[----------
J4 probably better...];B[gp]C[----------
Now it's really hard for White. Going to the center is probably your best bet, but it seems too open to win the game. If you are to try it, you have to try to keep sente (initative) to build walls against Black...]
(;W[bi]LB[ke:A][pm:B]C[----------
Not sente enough I think.

When you have sente, remember the guidelines :

1. strengthten your groups
2. attack opponent's weak groups
3. take big points

In this order ! And ake moves that do many things first.

What is difficult is to know when a group is weak ^^

You have dead groups but none really weak.
O17, J17, F11 can be attacked, but can probably sustain an attack.

Black L17 is weak (in your spere of influence)

You can invade at C17
You can use the aji left by your dead stones in the lower left.

I think a move that attacks L17 and stenghten J17 or O17 is better as it do 2 things, and threaten to make a big center. A move at (A) is probably the best.

B seems good too, as it stenghten your R9 stone and begin to close the center, but probably not enough.

Your play at B11 is certainly big (takes a lot of points from black and exploit D7 aji) but it is not sente enough. As you're behind, you can not play such moves ...]
;B[ch];W[cl]C[----------
You exploit the aji, good idea.];B[ck];W[bk];B[ci]TR[bi][di]
SQ[ch]C[----------

;B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[dl]
(;W[ri]C[----------

Do not play tenuki if you are not sure to live.
S11 is not sente enough ! If you play C8 you are alive.

And you lose sente ^^ That's why you invade after playing all your other urgent moves ^^]
;B[bl];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[bs]
(;W[bp]C[----------
No.
6 stones on the second line are dead.
7 stones are dead too, if your opponent plays first.
8 stones are alive on the second line, even if opponent plays first. See my previous variations.

I've tried some variations to make you live from here, with no success ^^]

(;W[lh];B[ii]CR[qn]TR[hh][jj]C[----------

Well I hope my avdices will help you. Of course, you have to get some practice to get better ^^

In that game :

- you played tenuki at wrong times. You have to get sente and play elsewhere only when the local sequence ends. Of course, it is not always easy to know the right moment. The question to ask yourself is : "if I play elsewhere and black can play here, can I handle any of his move ?"
- you have to try not to create weak groups. Your O17 stone was one of your big mistake. Your opponent will exploit your weaknesses, even if your group live.
- you have to attack your ennemy weak groups. Status of groups is something important to watch out.
- do urgent moves BEFORE big moves : defend, attack THEN take points (big points, invasion, reduction)
- try to make good shapes and to avoid bad shapes ^^

Probably something like that. As you have not answered B kakari.]

(;W[ch]C[----------
Here you attack black more efficiently than in the game. Like in the game, the ploblem is that it can lead to complications ^^]
(;B[ck]C[---------
Black can pincer and later attack your D2 stone])
(;B[eg]C[----------
Or black can go out, attacking C12 ...]))
(;W[pe]C[----------
This is certainly possible but there is lots of possible variations, especially considering the stone at R12. But you have support of the J17 group ...]

(;W[db]CR[cc]C[----------
You slide and threaten to get the whole corner with C17 ...]
(;B[cc]C[----------
B defends the corner ...];W[ic]C[----------
And you stabilize.

Both players get a part of the corner. It stabilize White but in gote (White has lost the initiative).]

(;B[hc]C[----------
if B pincers, you can trade the corner against B inluence ...]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fd];W[bf];B[gd]C[----------
Here you get the corner and B the infuence. There's lots of possible variations. See Kogo's dictionnary !]
))
(;W[cc]C[----------
You can also invade the corner directly ...];B[dc];W[db];B[eb]
;W[cb];B[ec];W[be];B[fd]C[-----------
W gets the corner and B the influence. Usually you invade when other things are settled. It does not seems quite good here ...]
