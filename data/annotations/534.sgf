;B[pc]C[Dear mkl and Scoob gtl   ask me for a rewiew and is a honour for me :)]
;W[pp];B[ec]C[why black play that ? i dont know, but maybe now black can do
wathever he want :)];W[ce]C[the same for white if black play for territory if i'm withe i
like to play for influence the contiuation perhaps change   stone 3  in work for influence.

i think d4 is possible here :)];B[de];W[cd];B[df];W[dd];B[ed]
;W[dc];B[cf];W[bf];B[fe]C[i think 13 is good ladder is favorable for withe then ...]
;W[dp]C[now  w as 2 stone working for influence and 5 for territory,
black is more

coherent ( but this is only 11k* opinion :)];B[jc]C[a wall with low extension i dont know if 4 line is better ,
usually is played on 4 line  :)];W[eb]C[why 16 ? seems sente then why not ?   nevertheless low side seems a good place for sarensei(k4)  because of
low stones of black 1 and 15.];B[fb];W[cg];B[db]C[why black 19 ?

maybe to prevent weakness around g16 g17 ? difficolt for me completely
surprise];W[cb]C[20 coherent with 16 :)];B[dg];W[ch];B[qe]C[21 22 both players can be satsfacted i think :) more withe
maybe :) because of low  stone 15.];W[ck]C[24 a big gain of territory i like personally k4 now  because
24( or d9)  and q10 are miai.];B[qj]C[25 another low move usually for my experience of chess seems ash
and scoomb are territory oriented players and withe (psychologic
strategy) like to give black possibility of mohio because black dont
like it  :)

seems a kidding game between cho withe kobayashi black :)];W[qm]
C[if i must play i like k4 but 26 is the idea if u dont build
mohio i leave u base for territory :)];B[oj]C[finally black start to build a mohio :)]
;W[dh]C[28 here a strong pro observing game suggest the move i suppose
:)

because now when black resign himself building mohio, withe start to
leave  
space for mohio is very good 28 !];B[eg]C[29 i think a loosing move rather than play 29 i like more
sacrifice the group, 29 is passive satisfaction for withe.]
;W[od]C[now invasion is pratically   forced if black play around centre hoshi i suppose take advantage. k12
l12 m12  ?];B[md]C[now black start to take territory but 15 and 1 stones are
territory oriented difficolt for management of mohio 25 and 27 seems a
little bit slow.];W[of]C[usually better to play light for quick fugue :)]
;B[mf];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc];B[qc];W[qg];B[ob]C[39 if corner alive ( also in gote better if black  play for
leave the base around n17 with idea not to kill but to compel running to
the center destroing possible withe (future) influence to centre and
after invading in every keyhole remaining)



now game seems compromised for black because is visibly overloaded of
stones in high side];W[nb];B[pb];W[mc]C[game is over for black now i suppose this 2 are professional 9p
and maybe they played this game in 92   :) i remember a similar position in one of best titles  
in japan is not important final result if withe dont make a big error
harmonious arrangement of his stones  victory guarantee.];B[rg]
C[43 very good move but to late left black wall no flesh no fish
we say in italy];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[lc];B[je];W[jb];B[ib]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[hb];B[kb];W[ka];B[ja]C[whats happen here ? i dont know maybe withe mistake or strategy
about aji and ko trheats ?];W[gb];B[la];W[fc]C[60 i dont understand]
;B[ea];W[hd];B[hf];W[nh];B[fq];W[hq];B[fo];W[ho]C[now withe has only 1 problem dont loose high right group :)

blach has 2 lumpy groups,];B[dn];W[cn]C[attack cannot be severe because right high group i suppose]

;B[jj];W[kk];B[eh];W[ei]C[132 natural move ? very big only question if  necessary '

around h9 possible ?   i like to ask  that to a professional, her for me is impossible to
understand , without help of teacher, whats going on     thx ash thx scoomb a very nice interesting game :)
