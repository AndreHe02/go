KM[5.5];B[dc];W[pp];B[de]C[A bit unorthodox but seems like a reasonable move.]
;W[dp];B[pd];W[qf]C[This is big.  Depending on style a splitting move around K17 might be preferred.  ALso C10 area looks very big because of the way it aims under black's corner enclosure.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qn]C[The first real mistake of the game.
White is already settled on the right side so this R6 stone has no possibility of attacking anything.  Black would be better to defend around K17, or even better to approach Q4 from the other side (or play K3), and I think best would be to play around C10.]
;W[ql]C[This looks like a mistake too.
White is extending from an already strong group and thereby pushing black to make a double-approach around O3, which is a better area for black.  Better here is just the simple move at O4, or, if you really must attack, perhaps try S5.]
;B[on]C[This is a far worse mistake.  White has a clear lead already!  Black needs to jump in to R3 or play O3 or O4 right away.  This one-space jump just makes a nice target for white to attack.]
;W[np];B[mn]C[Black's weak group is running with nothing to counterattack against.  White can just keep hopping along the fourth line forever...]
;W[ro]C[This looks like a mistake.  Black can now play M4 and perhaps semi-enclose white.  Also S5 doesn't really close the corner, and black already didn't have any real eye space here.  So S5 should be M4.]
;B[lp]C[M4 looks like a nice aggressive
move for black.

 sep 11k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[lq]C[A slightly passive answer.  The ladder block at C11 area makes the cut potential seem interesting.  Perhaps just patiently linking up with S6 and waiting for a chance to cut at M5 later would be better than M3 immediately.

 HANiN 11k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[pk]C[Q9 is not the direction of play now.  White can give up R8 easily since the group above is already alive and white can play S6 at any time anyway.  So the answer to Q9 should be L4, I think, and thus black's answer to M3 should have been something near that area -- like perhaps N3.

 HANiN 11k*: hello ?];W[qk];B[pl];W[pj]C[Q10 makes a nice shape but compare its size to L4.]
;B[mq]C[Finally someone makes the urgent play.];W[mp];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr]
;W[lo]C[Good strategy -- to make use of Q10 white wants to keep black's outside group weak.]
;B[kp];W[mr]C[Wrong way!  White should let black take the edge and concentrate on attacking the outside.  On the other hand N2 is somewhat playable if white is prepared to attack very aggressively.]
;B[mo];W[kn]C[And white does attack very very aggressively.  But white's group is not solid enough to withstand this.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[op];W[no];B[nn]C[big mistake.
Black P5 pretty much captures the corner; white still has to save his edge group; so black will probably have time to play around F3 and white's position is now horrible.

Now white has a chance in this fight again.];W[oo];B[pq]C[To review:  Black R6 approached from the wrong side, then white R8 was also the wrong side, but black jumped to P6 which made white's move look good.  Then white S5 was the wrong direction, which should have jumped out to M4.  Then both sides ignored the urgent move in the M4 area for too long.  Then white played too aggressively on the edge and now black is trying to punish that by making use of white's bad aji.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[po]C[with this cut white is going to be hard pressed to save everything, but on the other hand black has problems too.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[or]C[White lives in the simplest way.  Now the question is the outside cutting stones.  Black has two eyeless groups though so the fighting may be tough for him.]
;B[rn];W[qr];B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[kl]C[By pushing this way, black is killing his own group to the right.  Better is to play around F3 and then attack white's cutting stones on a large scale, after making sure that BOTH sides can get life.  Blacks big right side group is almost dead now.]
;B[mj];W[jl]C[A nice move by white, strongly getting out into the center and therefore threatening black on both sides.  Black's N10 move may prove to be a bit of an overplay.]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[Seems reasonable; white may want to consider E3, also, because black will then be somewhat overconcentrated.  But C6 seems fine.]
;B[dq]C[This is not an urgent move since black's group is already alive.  White should think about renewing the attack on black's lower right group.]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[ep]C[This is certainly not urgent.  E4 should be an attack on black's right side group, either around L11 or if your reading ability is up to it, you can consider O9.  I think L11 looks best.  N12 seems possible too.]
;B[fp]C[Not urgent for black, either; this move should be around N12, defending the big group and semi-linking to the top.  THen black can make a big potential territory up there!]
;W[jo]C[This is the wrong way; white should attack the weak group on the right, not the strong group at the bottom.]
;B[ko];W[in];B[ln]C[Now black is strong everywhere.  White made a nice capture of two stones in the middle but even if black just gets sente he is probably winning.]
;W[jp];B[ch]C[Takes profit while breaking the ladder; black is in good shape.  White's K4 is not a big deal; black can play J3 if necessary to link up, but even if white pushes down more black can still link up.
 sep 11k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[di]C[The correct answer to a ladder-block is almost always to capture the ladder; moves like D11 just leave white bad potential for later.  Also, is D11/C11 really a good exchange for white anyway?

 HANiN 11k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[ci];W[dj];B[hq]C[H3 should be J3 to link up more solidly to the right (where the white stones are in the way)]
;W[ic]C[White has no chance of winning the game if black gets to close off the upper side.  But this white group (J17 stone) will come under severe attack and later if the ladder is broken again .. white may get in big trouble.]
;B[kc];W[fc];B[eb]C[probably too small.  white can run for the center...]
;W[fb]C[also probably too small.];B[gd]C[Too close to white's group.  Black should be trying to chase white into the center, hoping to make a move that both attacks white's upper group and breaks the ladder at the bottom.

Also note that instead of E18 black could have played G18 or H18 and really taken white's eye base away.]
;W[kb];B[lb]C[K18 is better than M18.  Even if white lives inside, the weak group on the outside is worth more.]
;W[jb];B[ld]C[Now white is almost alive on the top already.  A disaster for black.  ANd white has sente, too!!]
;W[cj]C[This looks like a nice, solid move.  It is good as long as white is not behind.  Let's estimate the score.  Black has not quite 25 in the top left, and after endgame has maybe 10 in the top right, and another 15 on the bottom, total 50 let's say.  White has 5 on top, 10 right side, 25 lower right, and now 10+ lower left side, 50 total, hence C10 looks like a nice solid move.]
;B[dl];W[fo]C[White is playing with fire every moment that the ladder remains uncaptured.  In fact J7 looks better than C10 now that I see this move.  Anyway we're setting the stage for a big fight now!]
;B[fl];W[hl]C[This greedy attempt to keep avoiding ladder capture just keeps giving black free forcing moves.  Not good for white.]
;B[hm];W[im];B[gn];W[go]C[Black still has some hope of killing the white lower center group, and of attacking white's C10 group too.  So, I can see now that C10 was a mistake as long as the ladder was still open.]
;B[bl]C[Good move .. .now white has lots of problems to worry about.];W
[bj]C[White stops black from linking up but a move like G10 now will attack both white groups, so black is happy.]
;B[bp]C[Looks like an overplay for black.  G10!  Split the white groups!  Since black didn't play there, maybe white should.]
;W[bo];B[cp]C[This doesn't work for black except as a sacrifice to gain a couple points in the corner.  Small endgame move.]
;W[bq];B[ap];W[co];B[br];W[ao];B[en]C[White may have all *three* groups die now.  Black is happy.]
;W[ek];B[el];W[gj]C[Good move for white to help link up two weak groups.  If white can live without taking too much damage, then moves like B10 which reduce black's territory will mean white still has a chance.]
;B[fj]C[This cut doesn't seem to work for black.  Perhaps the E6 cut is better.  Or maybe G9.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[gl];B[hk];W[gm];B[fm];W[hn]C[White has one live group now...]
;B[hj];W[gi];B[hi];W[gh];B[hh]C[Now white's left side group looks semi-alive.  One eye at F10, anyway, that's for sure.

 sep 11k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[kj]C[White should be worrying more about life and death on the left side.  Is black's D8 group really dead?  If so then white is already ahead, so G13 is better (since it aims toward helping the upper-side group which may still have some small trouble).  If D8 is not dead, then white needs a move there.


 HANiN 11k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[gg];W[fh];B[fg];W[eh];B[eg];W
[dh];B[cg]C[Now that white has done all this work to capture a few points at F10, black has the hope of a sevee attack on white's top side group.]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[hf];B[if];W[he];B[ie];W[hd];B[dg];W[jh];B[ih];W[jd];B[id]
;W[hc];B[jc];W[fe];B[dk];W[ej];B[fi];W[bm];B[bk];W[dm];B[bi];W[aj];B[ai]
;W[em];B[ck]C[So in the end black's stones lived and white had to resign.

Thus the real final losing move was probably L10.  Though K12 may have been the final culprit -- black would have had some work if K12 had been the cut instead of the peep.]
