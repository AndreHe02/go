AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Thanks for taking the time to review this game. I'm mainly interested in the direction of play, since every time that stronger players approach my 4-4 points I don't know how to respond properly and I tend to get in trouble. Any other suggestions or comments are welcome.

I commented what was going on in my head when I played certain moves. I did it so you can understand why I played the way I did and hopefully it will be clearer at the time of reviewing. I hope this helps a little.

This game was played at the Tucson Go Club and it took about 1.5 hours. We both play slowly.

Black is 7k and white is 1k. White wins by 4.5 points.

I greatly appreciate your review. I'm very enthusiastic about Go and I study constantly so I can improve.

Thanks a lot for reviewing my game. .

JH: Nice to meet you.  I'll be annotationg my comments with JH (Josh Hoak).  I play on KGS as Kashomon and I'm 1k.]
;W[fq];B[jq]C[I pincered so I could build a moyo in the lower right corner, using Q4.

JH: Sounds good.];W[cn];B[eo]C[I was trying to separate both stones.

JH: good.];W[dl];B[fj]C[I think this was a mistake but I was afraid that if I played somewhere else black would approach  D16  and later attack D10. What is a better response?

JH: I think this is fine.];W[fl];B[gp]C[Trying to capture F3.

JH: Don't worry too much about capturing at this stage.];W[cq]
(;B[dq]LB[cp:A]C[JH: This is the first big mistake. This move is the wrong direction. A is correct -- see variation.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cp]C[I think this is terrible for black since he is overconcentrated.

JH: Yup];B[fc]C[I think this is a weak play, I was concerned that white would approach that corner around F3 and get the top.

(;B[pn]LB[ql:A]TR[pj]C[With this response I was aiming at builing a moyo in the lower side, it didn't work off course.

JH:  I don't like this move, as it's too defensive.  It makes the white stone stronger, while you get the corner.  In this position, you want to keep the marked black stone strong so you can attack the white stones on the top.  Playing at A gives black a great position.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[np]
(;B[mq]LB[po:A][op:B]C[I wanted to deny white from a base. Should I have played P4 instead?

JH: Yes.  I don't know which is better here -- probably P4 (B).  N3 is definitely a mistake; the cut at A is painful for you.]

;W[mp];B[lp]LB[lq:A][mr:C][nr:B]C[JH: It's better to play at A, since it gives you the option of connecting at B.  Now, connecting at B doesn't work because of the cut at C.]

JH: Sounds good.  A is also an option -- It's a bit more active since it helps develop your moyo on top.]

(;B[ki]LB[kb:B][bg:A][oo:C]TR[ic][lc][lo][mo][mp][np][nq]C[protecting another cut

JH: This is not an important cut and it's an important point in the game.  Better to take one of the huge remaining moves on the board.

A: Simple move that reduces whites territory by a ton. The swing here is probably 10+ points, and you get B11 as a followup.
B: You are very strong in the center.  You should attack the stones on the top.
C: The marked white stones on the bottom are not totally alive.  C begins to attack these stones.  This was a major miss -- how weak these stones actually were.]
