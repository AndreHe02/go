C[I'm playing with a random opponent and I got disconnected+ auto resigned by the system, :(

This is an interesting game,(for me tho :p) and I'd like to know how bad I played, and who do you think is winning? Did I have a chance?

Btw, this is my first kifu upload, I think I need a tutor on this one, :) I'd be happy to know mine and my opponent mistakes, better move, etc.
Thank you very much for the kind reviewer! Waiting for the tutor comments. :)*bows*

[Actorios\]: My name is Guillaume (nick : Actorios on KGS). I'll review this game for you. Let me know if you have further questions from my this file.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj]C[EF: Is this wrong? 3 stars start..
[Actorios\]: Nothing wrong with that. This is san ren sei, a standard fuseki (you can see the exact same position up to move 6 here: http://senseis.xmp.net/?SanRenSei). As mentioned it favors influence over territory. Hoshi play is influence-biased and your fifth move favors quick development.]
;W[dj]
(;B[cf]LB[fc:A][cf:B]C[[Actorios\]: You should approach san ren sei from the outside at A. Where you played, Black is already pincered and in an unfavorable position. I think the relative bad position you got at the end of the fight was due to this approach from within.]
;W[bd]
(;B[ci]C[[Actorios\]: Usually it's not great to perform an extension in diagonal to an opponent stone. By touching it, you are strengthening it. When you search for life, it doesn't matter that much but here you can still run into the center.]
;W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[be];W[cd]LB[jp:A]C[[Actorios\]: You are giving incredible strength to your opponent by enlarging your base at all cost.  Hopes to invade the top corner have disappeared and the bottom left side looks problematic.]
;B[eh]LB[fc:C][gc:B][jd:G][dg:E][fj:D][co:A][jp:F]C[[Actorios\]: I'm not sure of what  would play here. I feel like white needs to get some benefits out of the walls he build. A would be the perfect extension out of the wall and therefore would convert its influence into territory. B or C would be painful if black plays it so white wants to plays it quickly not to bother anymore about this corner. I guess playing at D would continue to apply some pressure on black while extending the moyo. This would worry black and force him to consider an invasion. E looks like a weakness in the position but as white i'd not jump into a fight until my position around are very solid. In fact once A and C/B are played I would quickly improve the moyo at F and G. A better player may advise F right away. I'm not sure about it.]
;W[di]C[[Actorios\]: I'm not sure this move accomplish much for white.]
;B[dh]LB[bh:A]C[[Actorios\]: My initial reaction was that this move wasn't really helping white (even if sente) but I guess it awakes some threat at A (for later on).]
(;W[fc]
(;B[pm]C[EF: Is this a bad move? :(
[Actorios\]: You are playing san ren sei. This means that you invite your opponent to come to your side and that you will get territory out of the fight. This move is a bit contradictory with your choice of playing san ren sei. On top of that, you are aligning stones on the 4th line which leaves opportunity the chance to leave beneath it.
To continue in the logic of fast development of san ren sei, K4 is the move you want to make]
;W[bg]LB[bf:A][ch:B]C[[Actorios\]: The invasion point looks like a nice spot from white's point of view. It threaten both A (connexion with the top) and B (cutting the 2 stonesStill black had very little territory there and can still run in the center.]
;B[bh];W[cg];B[df];W[bf];B[ch];W[ce]
(;B[dg];W[ae]C[[Actorios\]: This is a lost move from white. This stone was captured anyway. White just gave you sente there.]
;B[gf];W[hd];B[gi];W[fj];B[ei];W[ej];B[ee]C[EF: I think I got lucky here.
[Actorios\]: Well white still got plenty of advantage from the exchanges. Something important is that attacking is not kill... it is to gain profit by threatening to kill. This is the content of the 1st chapter from "Attack & Defense". Here white can be very very satisfied. He made and expanded sure territory at the top and he built tremendous influence which he can convert into territory in one single move if he wants to (C4 both defends the corner and build from the wall. Still I think that here white can play K4 and get a very big moyo.]
;W[dm];B[eo]LB[do:A]C[EF: Instinct attack. . lol
[Actorios\]: I would follow the proverb here: "Play away from strength". The wall radiates tremendous power. Any fight which happens will greatly favor white. If you want to fight I would maybe prefer F3 instead (which could result into a san san invasion) because there is a chance to make a base (even if white could pincer).
But I would still prefer to play K4 at this stage from black's perspective.
I must say I'm usure about how much you can play this move but it doesn't come to my mind as an option.]
(;W[fi];B[fh];W[do];B[eq]C[[Actorios\]: You cannot jump like this in front of white, you're asking to be cut. and would have difficulties in any resulting fight as you would have 2 groups to defend.]

(;B[id];W[ic];B[gd];W[gc];B[he];W[hc]C[[Actorios\]: Those exchanges gave sure territory to white white you gained pretty much nothing. It's better to jump away and connect to your other stones rather than play J16]
;B[fd]C[[Actorios\]: This is no threat. White should not answer locally.]
(;W[ed];B[gg];W[ke];B[mc]
(;W[kg]C[EF: What does this move mean?
[Actorios\]: White probably wants to take away your main exit road (but there is still G11).]
;B[fe]C[EF: And so I played safe and went here to end my fear.]
;W[qd]C[EF: I don't know that one should attack like this, and I don't know how to punish it, kinda doubt myself so I'll reply softly. .
[Actorios\]: As white I would play at the bottom which is still quite open. I'm pretty sure white can play the attachment as an invasion. There is no special  punishment to be applied. Remember than playing on the 4-4 gives you no direct territory. There is a lot of space for white to come in.]

;B[qb];W[pe];B[rh];W[pf]C[EF:Bad result?
[Actorios\]: White is happy. He wanted to invade and he successfully did it. He has an eye and the alternative of making the other one or connecting to the center. Black's group at O18 looks now weak.]
;B[nd]C[[Actorios\]:Clearly, this is good to defend this group at this stage.]

[Actorios\]: This is again an option white has : 3 stones on the 4th line make no territory. For that reason, Q7 would have been better played one line lower (as a rule of thumb, it's good to vary between 3rd and 4th line during the fuseki for balance between territory and power).]
(;B[ql]C[[Actorios\]: I think you used the right direction. If you go the other way, you're threatened to be killed.]

Again, thank you very much for the reviewer, sorry for my lotsa questions. :) *bows*

[Actorios\]: I think you can live. The first move is most likely N7 to do that. Then, one of your first question is "who is winning?". Let's count... For white around 50-55 + komi + 3 prisonner =>  60-65]

[ns:29][os:30][ps:31]C[[Actorios\]: For black: 55-60 + 2 prisonners. Basically, it's undecided. I feel that white still has the advantage because he's got quite a few pressing move around the group which is no living but basically, it's a close game.

Bottom line, I think you were behind in the fuseki due to the invasion wihin the san-ren-sei instead of coming from the outside. White had good occasions to build excellent influence but rejected to respond to some moves which were very important (move 50 for example). At the end, the response to the invasion needed to be sharper than it was. White was at an advantage in the fight and could have collected some territory out of the fight and let black live smaller in the middle. This successful invasion brought you back on equal grounds.
Remember that hoshi play are for influence. builiding on the 4th line is no territory what so ever and is therefore prone to invasions. It is not bad in itself but you need to know it. It's often good to alternate 3rd and 4th line in the fuseki. 
Note also that it is often better to think about attack as a threat to kill but with the goal to build territory or influence. Trying to kill at all cost may end up in disaster if you don't succeed in doing so. Of course, wen invaded in a very strong position, you should play to kill.

That's it. I hope it was of some interest for you.])
