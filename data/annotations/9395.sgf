AB[pd][dp]C[SolarBear [3k?\]: Hi! Have fun!

Hello! I've been away from online play for a long time and I'm slowly starting to come back to the game. This was my first really serious game, not too fast game. I was rated 3k? against a 1k opponent and I think it didn't go as bad as I thought it would (I was 4k, nearly 3k when I stopped playing).

I've added some comments and questions along the way.

Hagios: Hello! I'll do my best to address your questions and provide good advice for moving forward.]
;W[pq]C[Venom [1k\]: hi
Venom [1k\]: gg];B[dd];W[qf]LB[nc:A][pi:B]
(;B[pj]MA[po][qo]C[I probably should have played at R10 instead. My aim was to pincer and then kakari at Q5 or R5.

H: I rarely see q10 work effectively, indeed.  Some alternative options to consider are marked in variations.]
;W[ql]C[H: This suggests that white originally wanted a mini-chinese fuseki and was unwilling to give up the idea even if it no longer worked well.]
;B[qh]C[White's move kind of undid my plan. I felt Black was overconcentrated on the right, now, although the pressure on the White stone was severe. So much for a strong start.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]MA[qn]C[I wasn't entirely sure of which direction to block in. I thought blocking on this side would help build strength for an eventual invasion around R6.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]TR[pc][qc][rc][rd]
SQ[od][pd][qd][qe][re][qh][pj]C[H: The situation is now that the marked 7 black stones are doing very little work, while the marked white stones have stolen 10 points in the corner.  This is unvaforable for black, but not game over.]
;B[dj]MA[jq]C[The situation in the top right was settled for the moment and the invasion seemed premature at this point in the game so I decided to take a big point, although I briefly wondered about taking K3 instead. Was this the right move?

H: It's difficult to decide, for sure.  This helps your left side work together, but would be far better if you blocked at q17 rather than r16.  The move at k3 invites an invasion from black, so white has to be careful when considering it.]
;W[fq]
(;B[jq]CR[mq]MA[cn]C[Answering at C6 would have been way too nice on White, I thought, giving him an easy development at the bottom. I used a loose pincer to allow myself to make a base later.

H: Much like q10, I feel this pincer is too far away to be much use.]
;W[cq];B[cp]MA[dd][dj]C[I was really bugged about which direction to block in. I thought blocking in this direction did give White some easy territory but was in accordance to my left side stones' influence. Was I right?

H: Blocking at d3 would have been a huge mistake, indeed.  This is the only way to block, but it shows just how out of place the stone at k3 is.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fp]C[Hmm, I was not prepared for that.

H: This move shows how bad k3 was.]
(;B[eq]C[I probably shouldn't have pushed.

H: Push is correct.];W[er];B[fo];W[go]
(;B[fn]C[H: This avoids complications, but white has a chance to recoup.]

(;W[fr];B[mq]MA[gn]C[I was torn between playing this move and turning at G6. I thought making a base was more urgent.

H: This is a difficult decision.  I think if white pushed now, you would be okay with it.]

(;W[qo]C[Seemed slow but necessary.

H: White can't afford to play slow moves when behind.]
(;B[ic]MA[nc]C[Again, most groups being settled, I decided to take another big point. I hesitated briefly in how far I should extend from my corner stone. I played one space left of the usual K17 because of White's marked stone.]
;W[gn]
(;B[gm]C[Too bold?

H: Too bold.  This leaves bad cutting aji in your shape and doesn't do much to hurt white.  This is only good if white is passive and afraid.]

(;W[fm];B[em];W[fl];B[el];W[fk];B[hm];W[fh];B[jm]MA[hk]C[Maybe playing, say, H9 would've been just as solid and not so easy on White?]
;W[bp];B[cn]C[A White cut at E6 looked nasty.];W[bn];B[bo];W[ao]
;B[co];W[bq];B[bm];W[cc]SQ[ak][bk][ck][al][bl][cl][dl][cm][dm]
[dn][en][do][eo]C[Ugh, perfect timing.

H: Now your 13 stones have made 13 points.  This is awful for black.
White's timing for the corner invasion was good, indeed.  At this point, the left is less interesting than the top, so blocking there is good.]

(;B[cd]C[Once again, I found myself wondering about which direction to block in (notice a theme, here?) Here, blocking in this direction seemed to put more pressure on White's loose middle group.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gc];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf]
;W[ei];B[dh]C[My first instinct was to play at D11 but that would have allowed White to play D12, giving him way too good shape!]
;W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[dk];W[il];B[im];W[ee];B[lc]C[I felt White's previous move wasn't much of a threat because of M17 allowing Black to make a base.]
;W[mc];B[ld];W[rf]C[Oh crap, forgot
about that one.];B[se]MA[pf]C[I spent a lot of time hesitating between blocking
here or playing hane at Q18 to build something in the middle. What do
you think?];W[me];B[pf]C[Overconcentrated. This hurts.];W[ne]
C[I felt this was solid but really slow.];B[gb];W[ed];B[df]

[mr][pr][fs][js][ms][ps]C[H: Now is a good time to consider the score.

Black: 53
White: 48

There's an fight in the center and both players have groups which might be weak.  Additionally, there is space on the board which may be claimed for one player or another.  The game is slightly better for black, but white has a fighting chance.]

(;B[mm];W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[nq]C[I realized
Black's previous move wasn't great because playing B N4, W O3 was too
nice on White. Not sure how I should have handled that situation though.]
;W[oq]
(;B[nn]C[I was going to lose some points
here but I wanted to limit White's development. I'm not sure it was a
good trade-off.
