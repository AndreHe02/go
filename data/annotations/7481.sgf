C[HI I am cook777 I be working on this review, I dont think it came out too well but you can always send it back to me. :) 

And now the warning. :) I am only a 3k meaning I can be wrong, maybe I am, though I think what I correct on is the idea of its at least better if not right. cant be helped I not a pro. ^^ I dont always look for the best more but a better move. to help you go from there. I hope this review does help you. 

Also I spelling really bad and this doesn't have a spell check. most people can still seem to read it. Sorry

----------------------------------------
Dear Reviewer,

THANK YOU!!!, for taking the time to review the game.

Added some comments of my own to point out my weaknesses;  please add advice for both players if possible, but particularly white :)

Once again THANK YOU, hope this meets you in good health and good luck getting stronger in your own GO games :)

Regards LINDEN :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[nq]LB[pn:A]
[qn:B]C[As B I probably choose A or B and let W deside to play a normal upper right or flow this joseki and depending what W does, B gets to answer the upper left or just pertend it normal joseki.

I hope I didn't lose you why I wrote it. ><];B[ic]LB[ec:A]C[Dont like this becouse W A...]

(;W[df]C[This fine it keeps it simple though I think it might let B off eassy though.]
;B[cn];W[ck];B[np]C[How should white respond?];W[mp]C[With the move you played here, it Joseki too. :)]
;B[no];W[qj]LB[oq:A]C[W should A first, I do undersand why you want to play this, but B plays A he gets lot of point and you stone be craped.]
;B[oq]C[Looks like B did just that.]
(;W[nr];B[or];W[mq]SQ[mp][nq][nr]C[Heavy shape. B got some good amout of points on right for it.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq]C[Left my self weak at the bottom but felt C12 was huge for both player?

This a hard one for me to know, I think i strugle with this quetion even in my own games. 

I cant answer with out knowning how right I am. I do feel like B move here is wrong.]
;W[ch]LB[cc:B][dh:A]C[maybe A intead? 

B still open for back so your move kinda seems low. (Not much points if B takes the courner away from you.)]
;B[mo]C[ok dont like this move at all, W group here like I said before is heavy shoudl spleit it with the gropu on the left and that group is not to strong eather, W have to work with both groups. (a splet Like I mentioned before.)]
;W[kp]C[I play one stone ferther, this move kinda craped.];B[db]
;W[cc]C[THIS WAY TO NICE OF B.];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe]LB[og:A]C[ANSWER YOUR QUTION: (that you asked in the next move.)
Want to help Jump out at A maybe better then B (your move) 

to defend a group you normally jump out to the center, run to live on the side if your cut off from the center. (or want be good to run out.)]
;W[re]C[Fells like a weak move for white?];B[rf];W[nc];B[ne]
;W[pb];B[rd]C[This seems not good, what take that one stone?]
;W[kc]C[seems nice for W.];B[cr]C[Black exploits the weakness 

I not play this yet as B there are ergent areas. not time for endgame.]
;W[dr];B[qb]LB[kc:A][qg:B]C[to small, very endgame.

B is very weak, 
1. make a move that helps weakend it more by making you strong to make the attack more sever.
2. attack it.];W[pc]
(;B[gn]LB[gn:B][fp:C][hp:A][kp:D]C[B should probably try A intead of B to split C and D up.]
;W[hp]C[Good. now just just pertect and you gets points too.]
;B[fk]C[not as big as it seems.]
(;W[jb]LB[ke:A][qj:B]C[A instead feels more right. 

Though your forgot about your B group. No time for endgame if you have weak group.]
;B[cb]
(;W[rk]LB[oj:A]C[get out to center to defend your group.];B[rl]
;W[bm]LB[qj:A]C[A steal weak.

Can it die in the next move?
No, probably not.
Why care?
because B get free piont by makeing you save it, and if he kill it that just great for him. 

I be tempted to try and kill it. ><];B[bn];W[rg]C[again get out.]
;B[bl]LB[ok:A][nm:B]C[Seems a bit small for black considering it ends in gote?

actrally a good size endgame move, though playing at A forsing you to run with your group wile making more pionts in B area in sente seems much bigger.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bk];B[am]C[Though he does end in gote here.]
;W[oj]C[fimailly!];B[bc]C[Same weakness as lower- side exploited but felt at the time there were bigger moves but this weakens me significantly later]
;W[bd];B[ib]LB[dc:A]C[If B going to play away at least though in A move first.]
;W[qf];B[se];W[ng]LB[qd:1][sd:3][re:2]C[Felt i made good use of thickness here?

You didn't have thickness, B did and never used it. now all he got is 3 points, 10 at most.]
;B[le];W[md]C[Was unsure about the life of the group on top?


I think he just knows that jumping out normal way to defend a group. So it just has that look ot him.]
;B[me];W[fe];B[ol]
(;W[jn]LB[lj:A][oj:B]C[1. B not really get anypoints there.
2. sides before center in endgame. (Like W plays T8)
3. not really needed exteadning from your from your B group to A seems to work well anoff. 
FootNote center are not as big as they look in endgame. 

[two moves in tree\]];B[fi];W[el];B[bb];W[fl];B[ij];W[gj]C[Liked this attack :) but felt black let me get away with it?

Dont feel right but I be anoyed as B.];B[fj];W[gk];B[gh];W[hi]

(;B[hg]LB[gf:A]C[A seems better.];W[ih];B[if]C[now B had to run with nothing to gain. Unlike him you used his weakness agents him.]
;W[kh]C[Looking good for white?

Yes];B[jk];W[mk];B[br]C[A little weak by black considering the centre? 

he probably figered they were gone, if so he should at least push in and threaten to save them, not play away like this.]
;W[hm]C[By not responding at the bottom, reasoned i would benefit more from attacking the centre? 

12 points move looks like to me. B can still push in some. at this point of the game 12 is a lot.]
;B[lj];W[lk]C[Dont attach, when trying to kill a group.
1. stay solid, try to not make any thing complix.
2. keep B from connecting or making 2 eyes, and keep an eye on anyting that may seem weak in the area.
3. dont attack if dont need to.

BTW dont quolt this or anything this just my little list not one of a very stronge palyer.]
;B[kl];W[lm];B[mj];W[kj]C[Thsi dont seem needed, your job to seal him in and stop him for getting 2 eyes.]
;B[jd]
(;W[lc]C[Was M17 necessary? Felt it lacked bigness but top group looked susceptible to attack? 

I answer it. :)];B[mg];W[mh];B[nh];W[lh];B[og];W[ni];B[oh];W[fn]
LB[oh:A]C[HUGE?

Black pushing in A ya,
not as big as a P1 move, it sente. :)];B[ds]LB[ad:A]C[Ouch :( 

Ya]

Please keep in mind I could be making a mistake.]
(;W[be];B[qc]LB[pa:A]C[Should have taken this point earlier for both player?

Its big. Black can A now. as well as have some points.];W[ae]
;B[pa]C[ya bigger for B then just answering your move.];W[ob]
;B[lo];W[lp]C[Dont see why you answered this.];B[sg]C[Felt this move strengthed white at the bottom? 

dont matter now. if does make stronger dont matter, now it all about pionts in the endgame.]
;W[sh]LB[rh:A]C[B should have A not much to lose bot lot to gain, also if he lose he maybe be able to gain with the ko threat you didnt answer.]

No your taking points. 
-----------------------------------
hmmmmmm Wasted sente if for earlly in the game. When somoene says your wasting sente what there really saying is, you have aji here and now your taking it away when you might need it latter. 

or this only worth 1 point even though it sente. your better off making a 5 points moves for now because W not going to bother with thoughs becouse it saved a point in gote.

in both cases of "wasting sente it dont appy here"

btw its no longer sente anymore. still big at this stage of the game.]

Big issue other then that for B was he didn't fight when he should have, or he just didn't use the fact that you had weak groups he let you make them stronger, or well he really forsted you to make them stronger. I think B started off well just helped W out to much by fouse you to help your group wiht him not getting much.]

Any advice on how to strengthen my GO would be appreciated!!

THANKs for reviewing the Game :))

1. As for any level in go, reading.
2. And playing a little more on the corners in endgame. [and not in the middle of the game adless you have to.\]
3. Turn in games were you lost, I dont know if you notested but I had more to say about B then W >< 
4. learn a little more about weak groups and taking care of them.]
