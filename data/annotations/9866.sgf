C[adomasu [8k\]: hi have a nice game];B[pc]C[Dear reviewer,

thank you very much for reviewing this game and helping me improve. This is a very nice game from both players as compared to how most 9k games on KGS turn out and I'm quite happy with it, even though I made many mistakes. In particular there is a very good example of a chance to attack a two-space base, which I messed up pretty badly. I would be very happy if you could focus on the correct way to attack it in your review. There are many questions included in my comments, as well as my opinions on many of the moves and variations, which are mainly to illustrate my expectations and intentions of the moves. Rather than long variations that would have to be read out in a game I would ask you to comment on and correct my thoughts and focus on shape points and basic principles, as well as the expectations of possible outcomes that come with each move and influence the choice between numerous shape points in a position.

Ben: Okay, I willt ry to do that!];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jq]MA[qn]
C[Unusual but I guess at this level on can't criticise this move.

Ben:  If your talking orthodox play an approach move like at X I would think would be the most typical, however a  play around the middle side is also large and plays here usually are a priority after taking the corners.  I think the logic behind approach moves is that you can attack and get perhaps the side for free (sort of), or either wrest away the corner depending on how the opponent reacts, wether he plays with Keima, or some kind of pincer.]
;W[pe]C[Trying to be consistent, playing for influence this game with the dual 4-4s. Black playing for territory, apparently, since he played a low split in my "potential potential".

Ben: It's probably best not to get married to a particular idea of playing for influence or territory, rather try to adapt to the situation as necessary, if your opponent is going overboard on influence go ahead and take the points.  I think of Takemiya Masaki who appears to be known as an influence type of player, however if you look closely at his games you will also notice that he is constantly threatening to take huge swaths of territory.  Hes kind of trying to be the spider that invites the fly, this lets him use his influence to attack.

I should also mention most professionals recommend to try to strike a balance between high and low moves, but there are always exceptions, like the double 4-4 for white is a very popular setup nowadays, and the goal isn't influence as much as flexibility.]
;B[nd]C[I like this move by black.

Ben: Lots of options, but yea I think this is an okay move.]
;W[qc]C[I play Joseki.];B[qb];W[qd]
(;B[pb]C[unusual move. Normal are P18 and S18; I'm used to seeing S18, which seems obviously better than this. However, I don't know what downside S18 might have as opposed to P18 and in what way P18 is better than Q18 as played by black. In any case, that's probably a very minor point.

Ben:  I used to come across S18 a lot in the higher Kyus, but personally I think its kind of provocative.  P18 is really the "honte" move I think.  Ill try to show why S18 is maybe a little too ambitious (by the way this Q18 move is probably not the best especially when compared with P18 and a with a 4 stone shape that is starting to make a group with basically two eyes - very important for attacking your opponent).]

(;W[qh]C[Not sure if I want to be greedier here. Probably not.

Ben:  Yeah I dont think I can really say for sure, this move has pros and cons compared to the main alternative.  Ill try to show the alternative and some ideas about it..]
;B[qn]SQ[nd][pc][pb][qb]C[I wonder about black playing playing one more move locally at say R10 or Q11 before coming to this corner. Seems fine in any case, however I have the option of pincering him here, which I chose not to, because I would be building from a low stone and black already has K3 which would work well with the corner invasion.

Ben:  I think your Keima was the way to go here, actually right now R6 isn't so good in my view.  The marked group is kind of unsettled (highlighting why Q18 is bad).  Maybe white cant kill it but a strong player could force him to live pretty small or take away a lot of potential in the process of attacking this shape.  I would play K17 or K16.  The move C6 also is better than R6  because of the greater open potential (always good to extend from an open corner stone).]

(;W[nq]C[I think this is still my top choice here.

Ben:  I think I would play here too, its solid and keeping options open for taking the corner is worth it.]
;B[rp]C[Don't like this move for black. It helps me secure my corner which can't expand to the left effectively due to K3. I would look at Q9, R9, R10, R11, R3 instead, one of those has got to be better than this.

Ben:  Actually this is probably the honte move, it practically gaurantees, as long as black doesnt have to tenuki, a live shape.]
;W[qq];B[rq]C[Not sure what to do here. Pincering black now seems too dangerous so I just respond. Either way this once again seems aji keshi for black.

Ben: Yes that's correct - this is aji keshi for black.  Best for white is just react normally I would say and play s2 in response when black does this, so in a sense this move only becomes dangerous for white if he chooses not to reply to it.  On the other white could consider tenuki here, but this would give black the option of R2 which is liklely settling his group and weakening the white counterpart simultaneously.]
;W[rr];B[qk]C[I think I'm happy with this result, however in the game I play a really slow move now, as black playing in that area seems like a big sente move. Not sure if it's necessary though.]

(;W[lq]C[I think black should tenuki this, or at least play F3 rather than G3, which seems quite submissive.

Ben:  In this position black can choose between  F3 or G3, it's just different styles of play.  As you recognize n3 is just too slow.  Strive to find moves that do more than one, this move n3 does 1 and half things, it sort of gets white more territory in an sort of overconcentrated way (thats the half a thing) and it attacks black.  Acutally it doesn't even really attack black as much as force him to make ideal shape, which he did, as you point out something like h3 makes him have to run if he wants to keep a presence here (he can't really make very good base here if you did that).]
;B[gq];W[eq]C[I'm very happy with this result. Wonder about what I do if black plays C6 or D6 here, which would be my top moves to consider. (also curious what I should do if black plays C3, which is something 9k's play sometimes in similar positions.)

Ben: Ill try to give some examples.  The key is to get something out of it, and try to make good eye shape if you can.]

(;B[cf]C[this seems slow, as I get a good enclosure from my corner after playing c7. However, I choose not to do that and instead play the mistake of J17 which aims to split black's potential. When reviewing this game I don't think it's necessary to do that, since doing so justifies C14. Black is likely to get sente from that and play in the bottom left corner.]

(;W[ic]C[Ben:  Probably nothing wrong with this move, but there might be some other options..]

(;B[kc]C[Not sure which side black should take. Maybe the other one (G17) was better, which would give black a fairly solid corner and lead to a fight after I would play M17

Ben:  I think black is thinking his group is weak over here, if he approaches from the other side then he will have to make shape anyway, plus white might still have a chance at the corner anyway.  See variation.]
;W[fc]
(;B[dc]C[maybe kicking is better, since it makes me overconcentrated?

Ben:  Probably, but this move has some merits also, and black definetely owns the corner now.]
;W[ie]C[I play this to secure my group as opposed to tenuki to the lower left which seems really urgent too.

Ben:  Sometimes it's worth it to make plays like this, I don't know if I can say for sure which is better.  I do know if you have a weak group it makes it hard to attack.]
;B[ci]C[I think this is the first real mistake in this game that's bad enaugh to blame a 9k for. I get to play my perfect corner shape now.

Ben:  It does seem like he could have tried for more, but really this move isn't that bad.]
;W[cm]
(;B[bl]SQ[cm]C[I think this move is bad, but it's hard to punish. I wonder actually about black playing C3 in that position instead, which might be better. Another move that come to mind are K5, but I actually like C3 here, as it doesn't seem like white's attack on the G3-group can be very severe.

Ben:  I've heard that if the marked stone were on d6 instead that it would be impossible to play c3.  Likely c3 is possible and does work but I would certainly use it to try to attack g3/ k3.

But in general I agree with you and I feel like there are better moves on the board than this one.  K5 may be one.]
;W[cl]C[I play this one, taking the outside and looking forward to a lot of influence and an attack on the G3 group.]
;B[bm]C[I expected B9 from black, which would be a really good exchange for me. Here I'm not sure, in any case hane at B6 doesn't seem to be a viable option.

Ben:  I think there might be a proverb that says hane at the head of two stones..cant remember for sure, but I think it works here..]

(;W[ck]C[I play this hoping black would respond at B9, which he did. Not sure if black could play somethign like C6 right now though. It seems quite complicated.

Ben:  I think in retrospect, hane was the way to go here.]
(;B[bk];W[cj]C[Not sure if this move is good. Black has the choices of C6 and D11, as I see it. Not sure what's the right move.

Ben:  Me either, probably just b10 is fine too.  Id probably have done c6 earlier even.]
;B[cn];W[dn]C[I'm giving up the corner according to plan.];B[co]
;W[do];B[bj]C[This move is bad. Black should play in the corner.

Ben:  Well, thing is he is alive all over now, and b10 also prevents you from digging in there, so its worth points and it makes him secure.  And he the corner is still up for grabs even after this (white will have to spend a move here to "reacquire" it).]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[di]MA[dm][dj]C[seems sente.

Ben:  Seems being the operative word.  But actually black is pretty alive down there and it isn't clear what white can do, except take away some points.  For black it might be worth it to play since white has some cutting points (marked he might be able to exploit later).]
;B[ch]MA[on][om][ok][ol]C[I think black should definetly hane at D12. This is too submissive.
I'm extremely happy with this result. I got to keep the corner, black is really low and my attack on G3 looks very promising indeed, which is what I emmediately turn my attention to. Unfortunately I COMPLETELY mess up that attack. This is the most important question I have about this game: how should white attack here? Maybe J4 is the correct move?

Ben:  Yes D12 looks like a fine option.  Im not sure exactly how I would handle this.  Certainly an attack seems in order.  By my estimate the score is probably very close if white is getting 6.5 komi, if hes not black is likely winning.

Also sometimes the threat is more valuable than the actual execution.  Unfortunately black is really weak anywhere else.  

It might be worthwhile to start with a play against the right side (Xs) first before doing anything.  In other words to attack the weak side start by attacking the strong side first.  if anything if he chooses to shore up K3 with a move like k6 he is kind of wasting time.  Another option might be to play K6 yourself and force him to live small.]

(;W[hr]C[making sure black isn't getting eyes here any time soon. However I really should prioritize sealing black in. If I get to do that in sente, maybe making points in the center would become an option.

Ben:  I know there is an adage that you should try to avoid making  points with thickness, but here I think you are right, by sealing black in, white will probably end up with a fair amount of points in the center (or black might over extend trying to erase white's points in the center and lose points elsewhere on the board).]
;B[hq];W[jo]C[I realize my mistake and play this move, aimed at preventing black from jumping out and pushing him towards my wall. However this leaves the escape route at L4 to black... really unsure what would be the right way.

Ben:  As it works out, your opponents good move is your good move.  And yes I think I agree with your decision to re-evaluate plans and play at K5 instead.  One mistake I see often is people make overplays even when the game is close but they play like they are behind by 50 points - like they have to kill a group or something, but in reality it would have been leagues better for them to just play sound moves.]

(;B[gr]C[I think this is a bad move by black, however in the game I responded in kind with my own bad moves on the second line when I should be sealing black in.

Ben:  See the variation for black's L4 move.];W[ir];B[jr];W[ip]
C[at least one move on the outside and still sente.];B[iq];W[fr]
C[this is a mistake, I think. The exchange F2 for E3 is bad for white. I think white should play L5 or M5 instead, not sure about which is better shape.]
;B[fq];W[er];B[gs]C[bad move by black, he should try to run right now. This move does litterally nothing, as black already has one eye. It's not like white can actually connect the two stones at g1, and even then...

Ben:  Good point, black should think about running or making another eye with n2.]
;W[go]C[wrong direction by white!? Sealing the escape route of K4 is much better.

Ben:  In my view they look a bit like Miai, if you play around K4 he will probably play around g5.]

(;B[kp]C[black will escape.]
(;W[ko]C[Ben:  Again maybe m6 here has some merits?];B[lp];W[lo]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[no];W[pn];B[qm];W[nm]C[desperate move which black didn't punish. This sequence is complicated though, it seems. In any case black is connected and the optimal result would give white less potential in the centre.

Ben:  Yes I agree, white's plans have gone a bit south on him, yet inertia seems to keep you playing to try to trap him in.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[po]C[Ben:  P5 was better.]
(;W[om];B[pm]
(;W[jj]SQ[oj][kf][dh][le][nf]C[maybe that's not the right move to enlarge my potential, not sure what it would be though. Also it feels nice to play tengen in a position where it seems like a good move...

Ben:  Indeed, however this might end up being just a dame point, meaning this play might really be irrelevent in the grand scheme of things.  

What about a play at one of the marked points (trying just to cut off places he can run to), what would you fear that black would do if you played one of these?  He can't invade too deeply or he'll get cut off.  And wherever he does choose to invade, if it is not too deep you can simply choose to make a shoulder hit (Katasuki) and shore up.]
;B[gi]C[Seems like a good move by black. Once again I need to attack and contain something and once again I completely fail.]
;W[dh]C[that seems like a bad move. It's not pressuring G11 at all.

Ben:  No I think this is actually plausible.];B[gg]C[good move by black.]
;W[dg]C[maybe black can even be greedy here and respond to that? In any case it's small.

Ben:  Maybe try to peep at h12 first?];B[ih]C[Not sure what the best result is that white can get on the left side. In any case it seems completely out of the question to kill black now and my territory in the centre will be very small. White should have about 30 points of territory not counting the middle, black has maybe about 50, which means white should lose this game.

Ben: still lots of game left.];W[cg]C[Trying to reduce in sente. Not sure how big that actually is though, it's not thretening to kill anything as far as I can see...

Ben:  Still this is big.];B[bg];W[bf]C[basically trying to kill the corner. Even getting a stone on B11 is not sente against the black C6 group though.]
;B[bh]C[Maybe the wrong choice by black. The corner is more important.

Ben: Agreed];W[ce]C[not sure if this is the most severe way. I want to make sure black doesn't connect though.

Ben:  Seems like the move.];B[cd]C[don't know if that 's a good move.

Ben:  It sure looks like a shape I would  try to avoid making.]
;W[be]C[This seemed like the most active response to me.]
(;B[bd];W[df]C[seems better than D15.];B[fe]C[black is very happy with this result. Not sure if that's sente against my J15 group.

Ben:  I believe a threat might be G18.];W[ee]C[I decide to cut black anyway.

Ben:  G16 might be an alternative];B[fd];W[ed];B[ec];W[gc]C[which is gote. My group is still weak and black has excellent shape. It seems like a resignable position for white.

Ben:  I think its worth playing out still.   There is still some unsettled territory to be had.]
;B[ij]C[good move making more eye shape.

Ben:  Yes good point.];W[eb]C[worried about my top group. Also this ends in sente against the corner, so I think that's a good move by me.

Ben:  Agreed, and I think you can play this now, especially if it does end in sente.]
;B[db];W[fa]C[black might be able to tenuki and invite the ko after white plays B18.  However, I don't think he needs to, as he's far ahead.

Ben: Yes, black shouldn't take risks and just play on b18 first.]
;B[bb]C[Safe move seems enaugh to win.];W[ik]C[I try to save a couple points in the centre. Not even sure that move is sente against black though. Black didn't reduce my center anywhere near as severely as he could have.]
;B[hk];W[il];B[hi]C[not sure if that's necessary. Maybe running to the top right first is better? Or some moves poking in my potential?

Ben:  Black has the makings of eye shape but still doesn't have two fully formed eyes yet.  You could clamp on G9 or peep with f12 for instance.  Black probably has to think about running a little bit and making use of his shinogi skills.]
;W[ji]C[Not quite sure if this move is sente but it looks sente-ish and helps me build points.

Ben:  An alternative might be to try the shoulder hit on m16 and attack a bit more indirectly.]
;B[ii]C[probably not the correct move by black. I think K12 is better.

Ben:  Hard to say for sure but yes possibly he should run.]
;W[gk]C[which is probably what I should play, but I'm so desperate that I try to play more severely and either get territory on both sides of the center or try to kill black if he doesn't let me.]
;B[hl]
(;W[hm]C[Ben:  How about G10 here instead?];B[gl];W[fk];B[gm]
;W[hn];B[jh]C[Black gets to play there anyway. I wonder what the most severe moves against the O16 group are. I might have let it off to easily.]
;W[kd]C[This seems at least sente. Trying to keep alive the hope of attacking black for a while longer, however this loses points.]
;B[lc]
(;W[li]C[playing a safe move as my two-brick-horizontal wall seems pretty shaky.

Ben:  You can play m12.  It's quite a fight though, im not sure I can decide.]
;B[kh]C[However I'm not sure if the move I was planing on (and played) is good here. Maybe I should have played M10 or hane instead of M11?

Ben: This position is quite complex.];W[mj];B[ki];W[kj]C[Can black cut me to shreds there? I couldn't read it out in the game.

Ben:  If you dont play here now then yes, it would be pretty damaging I would think.  But your safe with this move on M10.  At least I don't see anything.]

(;B[lh]C[Black didn't try, but I think there's a lot more aji in there than black used.]
;W[ne]C[same idea as L16. Doesn't really seem severe enaugh against the O16 group though, maybe I'm underestimating it.

Ben:  I think it's hard to completely cut the group off at this point.  Black can probably Shinogi two eyes simply by making threats to escape.]
;B[md];W[me];B[qr]C[no idea why black decided this was the time to do this. Also not sure if that's the best move locally.

Ben:  This is not so good, it probably loses a half point locally, just T2 is the best local play.]
;W[pr]C[Ben:  Good!];B[qp]C[Ben:  Now this is really just bad..after this T2 isn't even sente, and white could play there instead.]
;W[qs];B[op]C[I decide that playing the ko is unreasonable. Black has nothing to lose from it.]
;W[pq]C[Ben:  Right they call that a picnic ko.];B[kf]C[black pretty much has two eyes here, I think?!

Ben:  Maybe is the best I can say.  Like I said I think he can finagle eyes by making threats to escape.]
;W[jd];B[jf]C[At least I think that's guaranteed two eyes now. It's complicated though and the move I played isn't best. Maybe H13 is good, but I can't figure it out. In any case, that's not what's important for the review, just reading which I need to practice. This is to correct my thinking.

Ben:  I cant say that I would have much luck killing this.. I dont see how either.]

(;W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[hg];W[ff]C[At least I get a couple points of profit. That doesn't seem sente though and there are arguably bigger endgame moves than this.]

It's probably a half-point better since you have the option to follow up with K17 later  (and his shape after is bad, a white M16 will be another point).

Thank you very much for reviewing my game, I think it's one of the nicest games aesthetically, that I've ever played, in that there aren't any obvious riddiculous overplays in it, except for MAYBE my move at J17 which was still not outrageous  I think, even though a bad move, and black's decision to take my lower left corner and live on the second line: also not outrageous for a 9k game.
The game features the crucial situations and mistakes one has to deal with when attacking somethign severely, hence I really like it. I hope the variations I provided (only aimed at showing my expectations in each variation rather than claiming it to be correct moves) and questions weren't too much to review. In any case I'm very much looking forward to your comments.

Ben:  Thanks for having me review your game.  You made a lot of correct observations yourself.  Lots of cutting points makes everyone nervous, with time and experience you can usually get a feel for when a positions is safe or not.

Ben:  Even though this shape is often characterized as being "overconcentrated" it's not easy to kill.  As for how to attack it, that depends I think on what your needs are.  I've marked potential local attack moves that black might consider.  Of course, with proper play white shouldn't have too much trouble living.  

Im also indulging in one rather lengthy variation that I think all players should know about in this type of position, see variation.]

In general I think black made the right choice.]

But if he is weak its better to play further away and avoid a contact play.  The logic is a contact play makes your opponent stronger.  If hes already strong though, a contact play cant hurt and may be a nice way to probe out a decent shape.]

Even worse the move b3 threatens to kill if black ignores, and if black replies he can think about tenuki since the two stones he can capture are just that - 2 stones.  Something to think about if a ko comes up.]

Maybe he can even go Q6 instead and erase the aji of black stone and try to begin building a moyo, but I think its worth it to play for more with a move like C14.]

;B[qn];W[qo];B[pn];W[nq];B[qk]C[Ben:  This is overconcentrated now for black.  However it's not certain this is such a great benefit since white has to do something like p11 to make shape or face some splitting attack, and this is not so good either since there very likely might be a bigger play elsewhere on the board and of course if white played r12 as you did in this game his shape is effectively settled for a long time and he can go ahead and play elsewhere in such a situation.]

Even if black played a move around the marked area (instead of tenuki) white could still make these moves at some point and potentially cause some problems.  The black shape has a lot of bad aji.  But for some the open skirt and the possibility of a monkey jump in the endgame is tempting.]
