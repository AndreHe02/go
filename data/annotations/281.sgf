DT[1996-05-08]TM[900]KM[3.5];B[qc];W[pp];B[cc];W[dp];B[nq]C[More usual for black to go on the side where  he/she has a stone,
eg C6 or R6.];W[pn];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[dd];B[cj]C[Black C8 looks better, since it's  white's weak point.  But I would
probably respond to C17 with C16.];W[cl];B[cg];W[cd]C[Good move, separating black.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[eb]
(;W[db]C[D18 is unusual, at least to me.  It is possible to take the
corner by playing the double hane at F18 (check out the variation).
However taking a small corner and giving black good shape on the
side isn't a good idea here.

In this situation I would play F17, it's bad for black to have
to crawl along the second line, and white gains lots of power to
attack C10, C13.];B[ed];W[fc];B[cb];W[ee];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[ef]
;W[fe];B[cq];W[bp];B[pr];W[jq]C[Don't be too worried if black gets K3 or K4, since you can
still invade to reduce the lower edge.  R3 is a big point,
gives the white stones better shape, and gives you a follow-up
on the lower edge.  It's wise to defend before attacking.];B[jo];W[hp];B
[ip]
(;W[hq]C[J3 looks better to me.  You would get cut off,  but you would have
some forcing moves, and it should be easy escaping to the right.
Check out variation.];B[iq];W[ir];B[ho];W[fp]C[Get K4 in first it's usually good to atari.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[gr];W[go]C[Be braver!  H2 would connect your stones, and  threatens F2.]
;B[hr];W[gp];B[eq]C[This is a bad result for white.  The G4 dango is  worthless, and
black's lower edge is looking more solid.];W[ep]C[This move looks small and gote.  Play big and sente moves.  Q16
looks like the best working well with G17 and Q6.];B[qj];W[ql];B[pf];W[hn]
;B[io]C[This looks good for white, but you want to  follow-up with something
like E9, that attacks whilst making territory.];W[df];B[dg];W[eg]C[It's not always good to cut, you give black forcing  moves by doing
this.  If you want to play here F14 is probably better.];B[eh];W[fg];B[bf]
;W[bc];B[da];W[cf];B[bh];W[nc]C[This looks good,  threatening to take territory on the upper edge.
However, be aware that you're open at the top (black could play
H18, reducing upper side).];B[fh];W[gh]C[Maybe G13 is better.];B[gg];W[ff]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[hg];W[ih];B[ig];W[jg];B[jh];W[ji];B[kh];W[ii];B[jf];W[kg]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[he];W[ie]C[Hmm, when attacking it's usually best to stay  away at first, otherwise
you could give black forcing moves on a weak bunch of stones.

At this point I can't read out whether black will live or die.  My hunch
is that black will live, since there is plenty of room and white has
weaknesses.  If you accept that black will probably live, then play
moves that disconnect the black group, and force black to live small.
You may even catch black!  Hence, how abut M14, which threatens
to disconnect as well as making white stronger.];B[if];W[id];B[lf];W[mf]
;B[mg];W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[me];W[nf];B[ne]C[This now  looks bad for white.  The O17 stone looks lonely.  I would
try to connect O17 with J16 and make a bit of territory on the upper
edge.];W[of];B[oe];W[og];B[oh];W[pg];B[qf];W[ph]C[
  HI 3d : W o12];B[hd];W[hc];B[ic]C[This cut looks wrong to me.  Black should be happy to  get the
upper edge whilst defending the M15 cut.  A little reading
is required, but L17 or the K17 peep look like they achieve
this.];W[ib];B[jc];W[jb];B[kc];W[kb];B[lc];W[mb];B[lb];W[la]C[You're lucky that  black let you connect like that.  Black should have
worked towards disconnecting O17 which would have been big.];B[ka]C[Black should leave this kind of move for ko threats.]
;W[ja];B[rh]C[Yes, a move in this area by white would have been huge, hence
it's also huge for black.  Perhaps white should have played here
instead of playing on the upper edge.];W[oj];B[pi];W[oi];B[nh];W[mi];B[qh]
;W[ni];B[qg];W[ng];B[pk];W[pj];B[qk];W[pl]C[O17 might have been better.  Giving you some centre  territory,
and as preparation for reducing the lower black territory.];B[ok];W[qq]
C[Good move.  It looks like these white stones are now  disconnected
so you want to make sure that they are alive, and R3 is a big points
move.];B[qr];W[ol]C[Not sure what this move achieves, apart from letting black  make a
move he would like to have.  Maybe O7 is better preparation for
a lower invasion and threatens some territory with O9.  I think
I would just reduce the lower edge though with N5.];B[nk];W[mp]C[Looks good.]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[np];W[ln];B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[jp];B[jr];W[kn];B[jm];W[hm]
;B[jn];W[pb]C[Yes, this is a big yose point.  A move around E9 also looks  big, maybe
F10 which threatens the F11 cut.];B[qb];W[pc];B[pd];W[bq];B[nn];W[ll];B
[lm]C[No good.  L8 tesuji looks better.];W[km];B[kl];W[mm];B[qo]C[Looks good. Would have been better if black had  first tried to
separate N7 from P8 (I mean way back  maybe N7 instead of
M7 for black).];W[po];B[rq];W[rp];B[qp];W[ro];B[pq];W[qn];B[qq]C[Wrong by black, this is  three points gote, whereas there are larger
moves around, eg E9, B9, B2.];W[nm];B[rm];W[rn];B[rl];W[jl];B[kk]C[Black is being optimistic here, J8  would be better.]
;W[lk];B[jk]C[As before, J8 looks more reasonable.];W[il];B[ik];W[hk];B
[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj];B[ej];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek];B[dk];W[el];B
[dl];W[em]C[Hmm, black played badly here, he should have  just made things simple
to reduce the centre.];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm];W[ck];B[bk];W[dm];B[cp];W[dj];B
[co];W[dh]C[I think this  exchange is in black's favour (in terms of points and
sente), so white E5 would have been better.];B[ch];W[di];B[pa]C[Good yose by black, lets you realise how big the simple  white
hane of R19 is.];W[bj];B[ci];W[oa]C[No, always check first to see if it's safe to play this move,  it's a
very common mistake.  Here you have to play O18 or P18.];B[ob];W[oc];B[na]
;W[nb];B[gb];W[hb];B[do];W[eo];B[gd];W[fd];B[mc];W[ma];B[qa];W[no];B[mo]

multi-purpose moves especially moves that threaten your opponent
whilst making territory; don't be too worried about losing stones if
there is a larger move elsewhere; don't get carried away in fights, be
aware of the big picture; defend before attacking; cutting isn't always
good; when attacking keep a distance, don't give the opponent forcing
moves on weak stones; and try to determine the purpose of your opponents
move, especially if you're going to ignore it.])
