C[This is my first post to the GTL. I appreciate the help, and I hope you get as much out of commenting my games as I will out of having them commented.

I have no idea what my rank would be- I've only played a handful of games (<20) and am just learning. I've read Janice Kim's 1st two books in the Learn to Play Go series quite a few times, and am working through the beginner go problems at Sensei's Library. I am soon to start on "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 1".

I really enjoyed this game, since a lot of life/death situations arose. The game went really well for me, until my opponent started hacking through my walls. I'd appreciate especially any observations about my connections and any nasty threats my opponent and I missed.

[dwheeler\] I hope my review is helpful. feel free to contact me with any additional questions you might have about this review.

I'm not sure how to estimate your rank, but you're clearly 4-6 stones stronger than this opponent (I'm assuming you played black since you didn't say). You have several weaknesses but you need to play stronger opponents to help expose them and practice correcting them.

you do seem more concered with killing than making territory. you can better contain your opponent by pulling back just a little and securing your own territory first (protecting your cuts).

its okay to let your opponent live. harrass, and threaten to kill, but let him live small while you secure larger territory.

I added a lot of variations (more than I usually do). They may not be the best, but hopefully they will help point you in the right direction.]

because there is no pressure, white doesn't need to respond to your move and could (should) claim some of the open areas for himself.]

Did I just attack too much? It seems like I had weaknesses that I ignored because I was bloodthirsty. I get the feeling that a better player could have done a lot more damage after breaking through... I wish my opponent had though[t\] more, as well; he used so little time!!

I seemed pretty bad at containing my opponent, and I know I missed some good plays. If you have any advice about this game or an aspect for me to study in general, I'd love to hear from you. If you any experience to estimate my rank, I'd like that too.

Thanks for your time and I hope you enjoyed my little game.]
