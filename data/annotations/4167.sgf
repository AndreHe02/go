C[     Hi, my name is Jason and I played white in this game.  I won this game, by only by 2.5 points, and I feel that it came more from my opponents mistakes than from my playing ability.  I would like to say at the start that I used to have a very large problem with leaving a lot fo cut points open.  I've tried hard to correct this, but I think maybe to hard.  I feel that a lof of my moves are to slow now, but I can't see what else to do. I'll mark all of my comments with J:
     Many thanks in advance to the reviewer, I look forward to reading your review and working on my weaknesses.

Seymour : Not problem. Let's begin ;)];B[qp];W[dc];B[cp];W[qc]
C[S : Playing too low will often result in you being "pressed" towards the end of the board. If possible try to play higher. Otherwise You are not getting any advantage. If you are not sure about any new formations, playing at D16 and Q16 is good and safe.]
;B[dq]C[S : Your opponent gets a little defensive here. Secures the lower left corner to his/her advantage.

A little slow but great move.];W[qg]C[S : Seeing how you have played the two earlier moves, rather than defending land you should begin attacking, since you are already at a disadvantage. Attacking from K4 or P4 is pretty good. You might want to spend sometime studying the different variations online for help dealing such situations, which is a MUST if your first 2 move is played at those positions.]
;B[ce]
(;W[dd]C[S : Good way to guard your place, but the method is too slow.]
;B[de];W[ge]C[S : You should have gone for E15 instead. You might not like the results of such a fight but putting at G15 shows that you give up on fighting.]
;B[ed]
(;W[db]C[S : See earlier variation for a different type of playing when your enemy hits you at E16.]
;B[ee]C[S:
By playing at D18 you have given black a good chance to link back at E15. Now its much much harder to link your isolated G15 stone back and black is much stronger.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc]C[J: what is the most effective way to stop this?  everytime I try I end up either walking my opponent in a ladder, which just helps them out, or jumping ahead and ending up with my stones being cut off.]
;W[ng]C[S: The war isn't over on the upper left corner, so playing this move shows that you are out of synch.]
;B[oc];W[qd]C[S: Defensive move, wise in some situations but defintely not here! 

Reason : You have 2 stones in G16 and G15, which can be used as a pincer attack on the]
;B[pc]C[S : Here is one boo boo made by your opponent. Black could have hit the emtpy space on the left.]
;W[ne]C[S : Hmm. You could gone for a pincer attack at M17. 

This move isn't bad, considering it prevents black from heading to the outside. But with O13 and R13 there, this move's potential is lowered.]
;B[nd]C[S : I would say chain effect. You attempted to stop black from progressing out, but in return black attacks you despite your defenses.]

;W[mj];B[nj]C[S: This is a great chance to counter attack! Check out variation ;)]

(;W[nk];B[cd]C[S : What should have being dealt earlier has been forgotten, and now it comes back to haunt.]
;W[nn]C[S : I can't believe that you are not doing anything about the upper left patch. Its really dangerous there now.]

;B[ql];W[pk];B[sj];W[si];B[sk];W[ri];B[ln];W[oi]C[S : Black is attempting to get a war around the bottom left area , so sentencing 2 dead bodies to their deaths wouldn't be a right time now.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[kj]C[S : A even better chance to counter-attack! Check out variation ;)]

;W[ik]C[J: When I first started on this side my moves at D10 and F10 seemed right, but at this point they seemed to be insufficient.  Should they have been played higher on now 12 or 13 instead?

S: They are enough, actually. Those two stones can prevent white from killing you if you get cut off in the center]

;B[kn];W[mn];B[in];W[rr];B[rq];W[ss];B[sq];W[sr];B[hj]C[J: This is a great example of what I was talking about when I said that I feel my win game more from luck and mistakes than by skill

S: I agree. I hope black noticed this mistake as well.];W[rs]
;B[cc];W[jd]C[J: This invasion was a catasrophe.  I know there is enough room here to mount a much more effective one, and so I had to try, but once I was there I was lost.  What are some good ways to work on invading, other just trying it?]

;B[ld];W[kc];B[ib];W[ia]C[J: It was about this time that I saw the play at O17, and how to take out the P17 group, but I placed myself in gote and couldn't take advantage of it.  What would have been the correct sequence here after O17 to take out that group and connect my K17 group to that corner?]

;B[fp]C[J: While this invasion was better as far as I can tell, I still feel that there was a much better way to do it, what was it?

S: At this stage, you attacks are pretty well done since Black really become clumsy at this point. Suppose both of you are extremely careful, you might not get so much land or you won't survive at all.]
;W[na];B[ob];W[oa]C[S : Overkill by Black.];B[gb];W[lq];B[mr]
C[S: Its either that Black is really paranoid, or black isn't spending much time thinking about what is happening next.]

S: All righty, all done. Maybe I have made a couple of typos here and there, so please forgive me on that. 
Overall, you don't really face many of the problems many players since you are quite careful with your moves , despite some funny mistakes. Exploiting the enemy when they fail to notice your weakness is a great way to win a game and gain experience.]
