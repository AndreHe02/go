;B[jp];W[dj]C[You developed a nice big moyo, but white has one as well. As it is
your move now, you have the lead.];B[cn]C[I would rather first extend your moyo. E.g. with  Varaint A: 13 F5 14 D6 15 F7 or with 13 O13 or 13 O14.  I would wait with your invasion,  as there are still several places in the white moyo
where you can invade. In fact: later on you will treat your stone C6
lightly, therefor the final outcome will  not be so different.  If you really want to invade at this moment:  invade at the weakest point of Whites moyo: F17]
;W[co]C[White should have played F5 threatening H4 and deal with C6 later.]
;B[fo]C[Here the move D6 is nearly a must. It is the only consequent
continuation of the move C6. But: As F5 is such a good point, and C6
was a mistake to begin with, I still consider F5 good.];W[dn]
;B[cm];W[dm];B[fm]C[Now compare the variant A: 13 F5 14 D6 15 F7 with the variant you
played: here there are 4 more stones on the board: C5, D7, C6, C7. The
additional white stones strengthen whites position, while the
additional black stones have not much power left. Now white has the
good response F9. Which he wouldnt have without the invasion (i.e. in
variant A). Still: Blacks position is clearly better];W[fk]
C[A very good move];B[cf]C[ok, here you are right:  Now an invasion is more urgent. Being a moyo player
myself, I would still rather have made a moyo-enlarging move like H8]
;W[ch];B[cc]C[thats the right move, yes!];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec]
C[thats a big mistake by white, as you know];B[bc];W[bd];B[ed]
C[Yes! You punish white for his mistake.];W[eb];B[de];W[ee]
;B[fd];W[ce];B[df];W[bf];B[ad];W[be];B[bg];W[cg];B[af];W[bh]
;B[ae]C[Well done! Now your lead is enormous! You have a big moyo. You
have some profit in the upper left. White has a bit more profit in the
lower left. But white has nearly nothing else.];W[gc]
(;B[ff]C[A bad move: If you capture this worthless white stone E15 or not,
is not at all important. E.g. if you just ignore this stone it would be a  bad idea of white to run away with it. F14 is a wasted move.
There are still a lot of big moves: H8 or O14 would fit well to your
moyo strategy. If you prefer fighting you might try K16 to capture the
three stones E17, E18, G17. See variant B
Note: If the white stone E15 would be a cutting stone (separating two
of your groups) then F14 would be correct!];W[gd]C[good move]
;B[ge];W[id]C[This seems unnecessary to me];B[fi]C[I do not see the purpose of this move. There are still big
moves around (H8, O14 or if you prefer: O13). I would say: The move is
mainly strengthening Whites Stone F9 as he can now defend it]
;W[ej]C[If White wants to defend solidly he should play E9.  This way he allows E8.
But I think White would have even stronger continuations (Like G9)
which might be more risky];B[fj];W[gk];B[ek]C[That is not good: you allow White to step into your moyo.  If you want to fight here: E8 is probably the right move. I
think White has to play D8 or so after that, and allow the cut E9]
;W[el];B[dk]C[My impression is: You want to use the aji of your dead stones C6/C7.  But you are not really doing it, as you are forcing white to good
moves. It would be better to consider C6/C7 as dead, and only use
their Aji, if there is a good oportunity. In your game at the end you
are able to get C6/C7 to live again. But firstly: White should not
allow this. Secondly: You are using up quite a number of moves for
that. The stones C6/C7 are hardly worth this effort.];W[ck]
;B[fl]C[Also not good: A) If White plays D8 it is clear that after
that exchange whites position gets solidified, while blacks additional
stone F8 has not much effect: You are only helping white.
Note: Your nice lokking wall on the F line is not worth much, because
of Whites G9.
B) even worse: White has a stronger continuation: ignoring your move]
;W[pm];B[qn]C[Perhaps R5, R4, or R9 would have been better. (DA)
What the best move is, depends also on what your goal is:
Your goal cannot be to kill the white invading stones. If white plays
well you will not be able to kill his stones.
So your goal is: You want to attack white thereby A) keeping him small
B) using the attacking moves to get some profit (or at least:
strengthen your position) in the corner and on the upper right

If you want white to drift baseless in the center: a move like R5 (or
S5 or so) would be better, as R5 will not be  attacked so hard by white
and you can play one of your next moves on the other side.
In this particular case: As white has G9 pointing towards the invading
stone, white would have support for those stones.

I think R6 is a good move here, if you continue correctly];W[qm]
;B[qk]C[Now you should continue with Q6: You get a nice profit in the
corner, if you walk along the 6th line. and your stone R6 will not be
so vulnerable to attacks.  Dont worry if white plays S10 before you can play
your R9: The continuation would be: 62 S10 63 R10 64 S9 65 S11 and
white still does not have a good base.];W[rn];B[ro]C[Here you must play R5. Otherwise you get under attack. Are you
afraid of something like whites monkey (63 R5 64 T3)?  that would be a white overplay,
as you can counter 65 S5 66 T5 67 S7 (bad cut for white). But one
advise: At such an early state: dont worry to much about these endgame
moves. There are much bigger questions not yet settled];W[qo]
;B[qp];W[po];B[oo]C[good];W[pn]C[Now you must think about whites cut at P4: Do you have a
defense against it? If not: defend the cut. Even P4 by black would be
a good move in that case: It gives you a strone position on the whole
lower part of the board];B[lk];W[op]C[Now the disaster starts: After white invaded your moyo, it
should be white, who comes under attack. But now your corner group is
getting under attack, and white can develop while attacking it.]
;B[no]C[Your move is probably best.
I dont see a better solution against the cut. You
can play 71 P3 72 O4 73 O3 74 N4 75 N3 and so on, and you would still
have the lead. But that is rather submissive. I think 71 O4 72 P3 73 O3
74 Q2 will not be good for you. White will kill your corner stones.
Ok lets see your try with O5];W[oq];B[rq]C[You should play Q2 here. I think you are alive in the corner
after that, and you can attack the 2 white stones. Dont fear white S4
black S3 white T5. as it is Gote for white and you will easily find a
way to live after that.];W[qr];B[rr]C[white R3 now kills your corner, as far as I see  (see variation B)]

(;W[sp]C[White overlooked Q2];B[pr]C[Good];W[pq];B[qq];W[or]
;B[qs];W[os];B[ps];W[lq]C[Well done! you will never have to wory about your corner group again.
But keep in mind: white has erased your moyo nearly completely. So all
together the result after whites invasion at Q7 is unsatisfactory for
you. Conclusion: You should not have allowed P4];B[jq]C[L3 is better: It attacks and defends]

(;B[so]C[Silly move. What would be best here? Perhaps N15 or N14. (DA)

Yes, you are right: T5 is an about 7 point endgame move ending in
Gote. N15 is not good: he can move into your sphere of influence
(e.g. with O15). Dont think about attacking his very stable group at
the top! rather build your own territory. N14 still looks to thin to
me. If you want to fight: play O14. if you want to play safe:
O13. With all these moves you still have a small lead. (both sides
have about 77 points of territory. But you have still prospects to a
few more points in the center (not many though). I added variations
for N14 and O14 at move 104.];W[sn];B[sl]C[Another silly move, costing me sente and not accomplishing
anything. N15 or N14 still looks good. (DA)

locally S4 is best. But you are right: the right area to play is still
something like O14];W[sm];B[ql];W[sk];B[rj];W[rp];B[sq]C[Thats far to small! it is 1 point in Gote. One of the moves of
lowest priority! There was no danger for your corner];W[oe]
;B[sj]C[again: far to small! white should not answer, but rather play Q15]
;W[sl];B[pe]C[Yes, good];W[oh];B[ng]C[Was this a good move? Whether it was or not, am I already
losing the game here? (DA)
That was a very good move, and the game is close:
Computation: black: lower right: 4, upper left 13, lower side: 18,
              upper right (note white can still reduce with S18): about 35
              captives:7; sum: 77.
             white: upper side: 27, right side: 4 lower side: 7 left:
       about 37, captives: 4 sum: 79
             but black might get very few additional points in the
      center
The point is: you must kill all the white stones (like P12 and later Q13)]
;W[of];B[og];W[pg];B[ph]C[an alternative: 123 R13 124 Q12 125 O12, and the white stones
are dead. Your move looks also playable, but more complicated]
;W[qg];B[nh];W[qf];B[qe]C[so far you are still in the better position for the fight and
the white stones should die];W[qa];B[rc];W[re];B[rd]C[yes, good, you should still win this fight]
;W[qh]
(;B[pi]C[Too greedy. S14 was probably best. (DA)
Yes! right, S14 lets you win the fight, and kills the white group. So
S14 is the most greedy move of all ;-)];W[rb]C[Now you should play S14 and still win the fight, and probably
the match];B[qc];W[se]
(;B[sb]C[I was thinking of playing T16, but I decided it wouldn't work.  Now I think T16 would have saved my group and probably killed  White's R13 group. (DA)

You are completely right: After T16 you are faster in the killing
race. As white can not easily approach at T17
But in fact: T18 might even be better: play T16 at the next move]
;W[ra];B[me]C[still T16: white needs even one more move to approach!]

E2 is probably on of the biggest move around. You should play E2]
;W[gl];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[ii];B[ih]C[I misread and thought this would work. I didn't want to play
K12 because I was afraid of W J12, B G13, W L14; but now I think I
should have played K12 and could have defended after W L14. (DA)

Yes play K12. There is a nice trick to learn: B K12 W J12 B J13! and
