C[Hi There,

I was Black in this game and lost by 15.5 points. Overall the game felt really close and exciting, but I'm not totally clear why I lost. Would love any feedback. I'm 7k on KGS.

I'll try to annotate my thought process and any questions I have along the way.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[oc];W[cf];B[fd];W[bd];B[cc];W[jc]
TR[ci]C[It seemed like a toss up between attacking the left group or the right. I chose to go for the top for now.

csh: I think you had the right idea. If you pincer the group on the left, White can slide at the top and threaten your corner while also stabilizing his group.]
;B[hc]C[This looks like bad shape to me, but I felt that if I played at M17 and white attacked the left group it'd be even worse.

csh: This is attacking from the correct side. If you attack from the right, White will slide under (say G18 or so) to make a base and it will be worse, as you say.]
;W[mc]LB[kb:A][lb:B]C[csh: Note that even after this extension, you can still attack the white group at L18 or M18.]
(;B[ch];W[bc]LB[bb:A]C[csh: It is most important to play at B18. This will keep the white group from making a base.  If he counterpincers, you can jump out to the center. If he does not respond, then you can attack at B13 and chase the group.]
(;B[ck]C[csh: This extension isn't important. It's more important to take away White's base.]
;W[cj]C[How do I respond to this? I feel like I freez a little when I see this - I don't really know how to defend.

csh: The most important point here is to connect your stones. Either connect under to make a base, or connect over the top to get thickness towards the center.]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[di];W[bh]
(;B[bi]C[csh: It's not a good move to throw in a stone here. What's your followup?]
;W[bj]
(;B[bk]C[csh: This is a bad result. Even the double hane is better.]
;W[ai];B[co]LB[dh:B][bi:C][dk:A]C[I see the cut but felt that it was more important to expand than defend.

csh: The opposite is true. If you're cut apart, then what good does the extension do you? You can't make a base if you stones are cut apart. This is why the throw-in at 'C' was bad. It strengthened the white group on the left, but did little for your stones.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[ek]
(;B[eg]C[Misread that.

csh: Yes. Now you're in trouble with the group in the lower left (say, the cut at 'A') as well as the floating group on the lefthand side. You don't have a base, and you need to make sure you have somewehre to run. If White wraps around the corner of the upper left, then that group can be under attack as well.

I also think the stones in the lower right are more important than the three stones in the middle. Give up on them.]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[dg];B[df]C[csh: This forced atari is also bad.]
;W[cg];B[ff];W[ei]C[Didn't see that either.];B[fi]C[csh: Again, your forcing his moves.]
(;W[ej]
(;B[fq]C[csh: You can only attack when your surround positions (relatively) are stronger. The white group on the lefthand side of the board is stable, while your black group in the lower left still is in trouble. You still have to worry about the cut at 'A' and make sure that the group doesn't get squeezed against the left.]
;W[cl]C[Yeah, didn't see that either x_x

csh: Remember, you can only attack when you have the stronger (relative) position. Because White is so strong along the lefthand side of the board, you can't pick fights here. His stones will have lots of allies, and you'll need to strengthen your stones first.]
;B[bl];W[cm];B[bm];W[cn];B[bn];W[el];B[dn];W[dm];B[em];W[dl]

(;B[cp];W[do];B[en];W[cq];B[bq];W[br];B[ap];W[ar];B[aq];W[er]
;B[fr];W[iq]C[csh: See? The situation is reversed. White can attack because his groups are stable.]
;B[cs];W[fs];B[gs];W[es];B[gr];W[cr]C[Was this group killable? Was there a point where I could have done it differently?]
;B[bs];W[ds];B[go];W[lq]C[csh: So after the lower left was played out, you have 4 points of territory, and white has four points of territory and two dead stones. Your black stones are also weak and in trouble. I think you ended up in a worse position because of your pincer. Doubly so because you didn't connect and escape to the center.]
;B[qq]TR[em][dn][en][eo][go][fq][fr][gr][gs]C[csh: You can't invade. You need to worry about the marked group. It's weak and needs to run for its life. I think this is where the game starts to go out of control.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[oq]C[I felt the bottom was getting too strong for W and planted the stone 'cuz I knew I'd have to attack soon.

csh: I understand your point of view, but you need to think about this BEFORE you invade in the lower right. Trying to get something on both sides is worse than playing out the joseki and then trying to reduce later.

It's better to keep the bottom undefined by not playing there at all.]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[rm];B[kr]C[csh: Again, you can only attack when your positions on both sides are strong. The group to the left is weak, so you can't invade here. You're getting yourself into trouble.]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[jq];B[kp];W[io];B[jn]C[csh: You're forcing him to kill his group.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[in];B[gm];W[jm];B[kn];W[hm]C[Had a hard time defending 2 weak groups at once, but the result turned out OK - both lived and I stuck a pike in White.

csh: This isn't an okay result. You're falling further and futher behind. White is making a few points at a time, and you're just running with your groups.]

csh: This is bad. If he protects, what does the exchange give you?]
;W[om];B[nn];W[po];B[nm];W[ik];B[hl]C[Peep to connect.];W[kk]
;B[gj]C[csh: Okay, so you've connected out. Now, what are the important points on the board?

The white group at the top is somewhat weak, and the extension along the right side of the board is big for both sites.]
;W[je];B[qg];W[qf]C[Again, I felt I really didn't know how to defend against this move. Any suggestions?]

(;B[pk];W[oh];B[oi];W[oj];B[ni];W[ri]
(;B[il]LB[rj:A]C[csh: This is bigger. The white group in the lower right doesn't have a second eye.]
;W[im];B[jl];W[kl];B[jk];W[ki];B[nj];W[rk];B[nf]C[I misread this - I forgot the right 4 stones were in Atari and thought I had netted White.]
;W[jj]
(;B[ij]C[csh: Right here, you need to look at who is ahead, and who is behind. You're fighting over small points in the middle of the board, instead of making the big endgame moves. The upper left is still huge.

Points are generally made along the edge of the board, so grab those first. Even expanding in the open areas can be bigger than pushing right at the edge.]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[lg];B[ng];W[hf];B[jh]LB[bb:A][ib:C][nb:D][sc:B]
C[csh: What's your plan after he connects? Play at the big endgame points instead.]
(;W[kh]C[csh: White defended wrong.];B[ih];W[ji];B[hh];W[jg]
C[Reducing.

csh: Points are made at the edges of the board. The middle isn't worth that much.]
;B[if]C[csh: This move has the same problem as the previous peep. You don't have a followup, and you're hurting your own territory.]
;W[ig];B[ie];W[id];B[he];W[hd];B[ge]C[csh: So you connected out, but you hurt your territory at the top.]
;W[hg];B[bb]C[csh: You got this first. That's good.];W[ab];B[cb]
LB[ba:A]C[csh: It's okay to play at 'A' as well.];W[gc]C[I didn't see this coming at all.

csh: It only works because you strengthened White by pushing against his stones in the middle.]
;B[fc];W[gb];B[fb]TR[ie][if]SQ[ha][ia][hb][ib][hc][ic]C[csh: As a result of your peep, you wrecked two points of White territory. He has one dead stone and six points of territory. Again, it's a net loss for Black.]
;W[gd];B[ga];W[ha];B[fa];W[hb]C[I think at this point we're kind of in the end game. So I'm just looking for double sente moves I can play.

csh: That's a good idea.];B[nb];W[mb];B[lj];W[kj];B[ma];W[la]
;B[na];W[nc];B[ob];W[lb]C[csh: White's about 25 points ahead right now.]
;B[ne]C[csh: Not really double sente. I think T17 is bigger, but it's nick picking at this point.]

C[csh: Overall, I think you were too focused on trying to invade and wreck territory. The weak groups hurt you - not because they died, but because you had to spend moves to save them. If they were stronger, then you'd be able to use those moves to expand your territory and points instead.

I think if you can stabilize your groups, you'll have a better chance to catch up in the late middle and endgame.

The life-and-death problem in the lower right also could have determined the outcome of the game.

Finally, look to make points along the edges of the board instead of trying to push in the center. Despite all the earlier mistakes, it was still possible to swing the game by 15 points or more.]
