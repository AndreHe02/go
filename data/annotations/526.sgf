C[Hi.  I'm rated at about 2 kyu in Britain, so see my
comments in that light.

;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[qi]C[R10 also common.];B[mc]
;W[dj];B[df]C[Up until now all the moves look fine to me.  But I'm
not sure about D14.  It does strengthen the top side, but there
are perhaps bigger moves.  I would probably play K3 instead
because a white move around there looks too good.
Also maybe D12 looks better than D14.];W[ch];B[nq];W[kp]
(;B[qq]C[Instead of R3, O5 is worth considering.  See variation.]

;B[qr];W[oq];B[rn];W[qm];B[jq]C[The choice of move here is crucial and should be given some
thought.  I wouldn't have chosen K3.  I think reducing instead
of invading might be a better option.  Perhaps D4 or J4.  It's
also worth considering playing in the centre.  The centre looks
good because helps black to gain territory at the top and is a
connection point for subsequence moves in white's sphere of
influence.];W[kq];B[jp];W[jo];B[ko]MA[jp][jq]C[I would probably play H4 and try to live with the two
stones on K3 and K4.];W[io];B[lo];W[jr]C[This is a bad result here for black.]

(;B[cm]MA[jp][jq]C[The marked black stones on K3 and K4 really need to be
defended, however, this would give white another move
to solidify the left side.  Black should be able to get some
moves in sente to help the marked stones.  See variation.];W[fp]

black stone on C7.];B[co];W[dp];B[em];W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[bp]

sure they are alive.  I'm not sure of the status of these
stones, so I would defend instead of playing S16.];W[km];B[lm]

;B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];C[Good game.  I think the key moment of the game was
deciding how to reduce the lower left quarter of the
board.  I think K3 was too deep whereas something
simple first like playing in the centre might have been
more effective.  In the game black had two weak invasion
groups which white was able to attack (almost killing them)
but gained anyway by reducing the top as a side-effect.])

(;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qn]C[This gives black a larger chunk of the side.  It also leaves
a move at Q6 for later.]))

about reducing the lower left.]))
