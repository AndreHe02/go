C[(DrK: Dear Slashpine, I will be your reviewer for this game. I note in your instructions that I am to review both sides and to focus on your (black) style of attacking go.

Before I begin, I note that to this day, I find this page helpful in relation to how to evaluate a move in any given game: http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions

Please read this before you begin and have it in mind when you look at your moves.

I usually try to find 2-3 things specific that I think you can work on, as well as making pointers to things I think you should pay attention to. I also note in your pre-game comment you want me to suggest what topic to study first specific to your level/style/weakness.

All comments are in brackets.

If I miss something or if you have any questions in relation to this review, please email drk.derek@gmail.com.

Cheers

I suggest the following:
1.Study when is a pincer effective (when there are support stone close by)
2.Study life death by doing Tsumegos
3.Continue to learn to attack - however, secure your own base first before attacking. The 4 questions for beginner helps in identifying when it is right for you to attack).



Hope this is helpful and good luck!

Cheers
