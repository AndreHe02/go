[dp];B[qi];W[ec];B[jp];W[gq]L[jd][cj]C[I would probably play at either "a" or "b". "a" is a key point for  black in this chinese style opening while "b" is certainly a good point for  white. But it's too early to tell and g3 is certainly a good point, too.]

(;W[qp]C[Too abrupt. See variaton.];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp]C[question play by black. usually taking s5 in this manner is not a good  idea.]
;W[qq];B[rn];W[po];B[qn];W[op];B[pn];W[oo]C[ good for w locally.];B[qe]
;W[lp]C[c10 seems bigger.];B[rq];W[qr]C[ponnuki at q3. There's a big  difference when black plays p6 which is a very good point for both.]

  RickMott 9k*: No problem...];B[dl];W[ck]C[Have you considered d7? Since w would like to attack k4  later, w doesn't want b thick here.]
;B[dk];W[bj];B[dj];W[ci]C[
  RickMott 9k*: I've trained myself to let go of the mouse between moves.
  RickMott 9k*: Same principle as not holding a stone in your hand...
  RickMott 9k*: saves you from some dumb moeves.
  RickMott 9k*: Are you using a real board, too, or just the terminal?]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[bo]C[Since w cannot hope to gain much by attacking d10  group, I would play d3 to get sente and either attack k4 or erase b's moyo.]
;B[bq];W[co];B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[fq];B[dn];W[eo]C[Seems soft. h5 or something  to separate d10 group and k4.]
;B[cf]C[Wow! Overplay by black. Black has two  weak groups and c14 makes it three.]

  RickMott 9k*: I'm not going to have time to finish the game...
  RickMott 9k*: But I'd like to, later.  Can we adjourn and agree on a time?
  RickMott 9k*: we both type "adjourn" at our turn.  To restart, use "load".]
;W[bc];B[ae];W[gm]C[looks like a wrong direction for attacking. I would g8,  and if black try to get out, w can start a double attack. Black seems hard  anyway.]

[p15 is certainly a good point.  but since your k14 group is unsettled, k15 seems more important. b can't  enjoy such a big territory when k14 group is alive. See a possible  variation.]
