AB[pd][dp][pp]C[$ Hi, i'm sylvainc on kgs, rank around 2-3k, I hope yu will enjoy GTL comments, and you can send me e-mail if you have any question left after the review.




Hello and thanks to whoever reviews this game: I am hoping to lose an even game that I played well soon too to get that reviewed, but this game - though handicapped - I felt I played at near to the best of my abilities at present and would welcome comments on how I coped with the onslaught of this much stronger opponent!

This is the first time I have used to Go Teaching Ladder - I'm using it because I've been stuck on 8kyu for a long time and and finding it hard to progress. Any help is much apppreciated :)

I played black and lost by 7.5 moku.

(;B[nq]TR[hq][kq]C[$ the 3 stones are bit low];W[rp];B[qq]C[$ in handicap game (and also in even game, but it is more true in handicap game) black musn't use stones to make immediate territory. Just try to have stable stones and to attack white stones



I normally play a much more influence-orientated opening, but when I have a handicap I'm always tempted to just capitalize on as much territory as humanly possible and just try and hold off white as best I can. As you can see, this is what I was aiming for here.]
;W[qk]C[$ here, black makes territory, but black is too kind with white. all white group are stables and can't be easlily attacked]
;B[qg];W[qc]LB[pd:B][qf:C][qg:A]C[$ i don t think white react with black territory-nabbing but because A is ogeima from B (and not keima on C) white can live in san san with no big compensation for black : 
black will make wall facing A stone (and make A useless) or a wall facing top border (see variation after 23 move) but white will end sente and take the border place.
R17 is good timing for white i find

$ i wouldn't
A makes no pression on B (B is stable)
It makes no much points because too near to C : it makes a "double wndow" : two black groups too near
and white will be able to cut black stones from C 
see variation for exemple]
(;W[dm]LB[dm:B][go:A]C[$ B seems deep in black moyo, but see now how black A is missing : if A where a black stones, white B would be fool]

(;B[cm]LB[cm:A][dm:B]C[$ oh oh

A is just the best helping move for white :

the lonely B stone is weak (no base)
so blakc must attack
toutching stones is not attak but it is a defending strategy (in case black were weak)]

;W[co];B[bp];W[do];B[en];W[eo];B[fo]C[I spent quite some time trying to read this, eventually deciding to play F5. As best I could see, white's group at C5 would be in more touble than my C4 group, which could create life by sneaking into the corner if need be. I played F5 because I felt both that I could be confident of making life for C4, and wanting to keep white's groups seperated.
