[nd];W[rd];B[qh]C[I am not sure about  R17 for W here.  Seems B gets excellent result by
closing in W and getting large center influence.  Perhaps W should play P14  first
and see what B does.];W[qc];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[ob];B[rf];W[pn]C[As B i would  play either R6 or R8, probably R6.  If W answers R6 by R7
he ends up slightly cramped while B has a large lower right corner.  Always
good in a large handicap game to get W to live small.  R8 for B would show
great spirit of combat, it is important to enjoy good fights in go. :-) O3
for B is a joseki but makes game easy for W locally.];B[np];W[qp];B[qq]
;W[qo];B[pq];W[qk];B[qj];W[pk];B[pj]C[R10 & Q10 are not urgent for B.  The upper  right B group is in no
great danger and this strengthens W while not increasing B's terr. very much.
B could play D10, J4, or F3 now];W[fq];B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[od];B[oe];W[pc]
;B[ne]C[This sequence O18-O15 is large for B but is not urgent.  Pincering W  F3  with H3 would be good here.  B would hope to chase W into center, making terr.
on both sides or chase into corner, making wall above W on left.];W[dn]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[eq]C[D5 better than D3 here for B perhaps as it doesn't leave  cut at D5.  But
 leaving cut here is not that bad.];B[dq];W[jq];B[co];W[em];B[nj]C[O10 is not  urgent for B as group is not in danger and O10 doesn't threat
en W.  I like a move around D9 or C10 for B at this time.  That threatens the  2  W stones by preventing them getting a base on the side.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[do];B[go];W[hp];B[cp];W[in]C[W at H5 instead Of J5 comes closer to capturing the  B stones but it is p
retty risky.  If B H5, W J5, B G3; perhaps B G6, W G7 first.  So J6 is  probably  a better choice, just try to chase B and make territory on both sides.]
;B[fm];W[gm]C[W at E8 may be better than G7 as it strengthens the 3 W stones.]
;B[en];W[dm];B[fl];W[dk];B[gl];W[hn]C[W at G6 may be better than H6 if it is not  gote.]
;B[fj];W[cf]C[W C14 may be overplay because of weakness of D7 group.   Better W at C12  or C13.]
;B[di]C[B D11 is right idea, split white stones.  However the D7  group is weaker
than the C14 stone as they are almost surrounded.  So C12 attacks the  stronger  group directly while B builds strength to attack the D7 next.  I am not sure
which is better.];W[ci]C[Now B must show fighting spirit and cut either at  C10 or C12.  I prefer  C10.  All the B groups here are OK while W has 2 weak groups, a great place to
play the bully and push your opponent around. :-)];B[dh];W[ch]C[Now W stones  are pretty safe. :-(]
;B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[dj];B[ej]C[I would like to ignore W  and play B F14 rather than E10.  If W takes the
 2 stones while B secures the center, B is very happy.];W[hc];B[gc];W[hd]
C[Perhaps K16 for B now.  Another possibility is H14, cap the W stones and
try for a large center.  B doesn't need to kill the invasion, just make
territory around it.];B[ff]C[I think that F14 makes it too easy for W.  B  must accept the risk to her
upper left corner and attack the W stones more strongly.  Perhaps H14 is  good.  Then F14 later.]
;W[kd];B[kf];W[lb];B[ke];W[jd];B[if]C[B is making a large  territory in center!]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[fe];B[ee];W[ef];B[he];W[gd];B[ec];W[gb];B[fc];W[ib];B[be]
;W[bf];B[fb];W[ha];B[bm];W[bl];B[cm];W[cl];B[cn];W[lo];B[nn]C[B at M3 here secures territory.]
;W[ok];B[oj]C[B should consider O9  instead of P10. The W cut at O11 is not frightening
 as B can connect to bottom with M7 while the W cutting stone looks lonely.]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[nl];B[lq]C[Good for B];W[lp];B[mq]C[Always look at the  possibility of extending here, L3 instead of N3.  Try
to read whether W N3 works.  Learn to hate to make forced responses, try to
resist with something unexpected.  :-)];W[kq];B[fh]C[E13 better for B? Also  consider M9 or K8]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[kj];B[lh]C[Consider M9 before playing M12,  try to read out what follows.  It is
complex, but opponent only 5 stones stronger will also find it complex so if
you can't see why it won't work, then consider trying it.  :-)];W[jk];B
[ij];W[ae];B[ad];W[af];B[bd];W[qd];B[pe];W[sf]C[Did W look at S13 instead of T14.   If B T14, W R13.]

;B[ik];W[jl];B[il];W[im];B[li];W[rq]C[S3 is very large endgame  move.  Both players should have considered it
sooner.  Easily worth 6 points.];B[rr];W[rp];B[lk];W[kk];B[mk]C[This gets B 3  points in gote.  Too small yet.]
;W[ll]C[Only 1 or 2 points in gote for W.   Let it wait.];B[el];W[dl];B
[on];W[po];B[lc];W[kc];B[ld];W[ji];B[ii]C[Moves at  S9-10, D-E2, K-L2 are now large gote moves.  Both players want  to get them. But first make all your 1-2 point sente moves: H5, N18, D13 for  B;  E13, T2, E9 for W]

seki...])
