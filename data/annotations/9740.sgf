C[B: hi, I'm Bart and I'll do a quick review of this game.]
;B[cc];W[gg];B[ee];W[df];B[gf];W[ff];B[fe]
(;W[dd]LB[de:A][ef:B]C[B: first, it's probably better to answer F5, see variation. Second, with this move you create a cutting point at A. And with the cut at B already there, there's alot for black to do.]
;B[ge]C[B: it white now plays at E4, still nothing lost.]
(;W[dc]C[B: better to connect your stones, for instance, play D5.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[ef];W[eg]LB[cd:C][cf:B][dg:A][fg:D]C[B: white now has cutting points at A, B and C, and an atari at D. Impossible to protect them all.]
;B[fg];W[fh];B[ff]
(;W[gd]C[B: still there are 5 cutting points left. Better not tenuki (playing elsewhere). The black group has 4 liberties and can always capture a white stone at the bottom..]
;B[dg]C[B: good move by black];W[cf];B[eh];W[fd];B[gh]C[B: again, getting another double atari.]
;W[dh]C[B: better play at C3 to protect part of the left side, and keep the stones connected.]

(;B[hg]C[B: not necessary. Better to play C3.];W[cg]C[B: good.]
;B[eg];W[ei]C[B: what if black plays C2 now? Better to play C2.]

(;B[fi]C[B: see variation.];W[cb]C[B: good to attack the lone stone.]
;B[di]C[B: or C2.];W[ch];B[ed];W[ec];B[fc]C[B: this cut cannot work.]

(;W[fb]C[B: why not play G7? Now white pushes the black stone against the two white stones.]
;B[gc]
(;W[bc]C[B: the black stone is already caught. Better to play at C1 or G8 to take some points.]

(;B[hd]C[B: not necessary.  See variation at move 38. Black can even play G8 instead.]
;W[cd]C[B: not necessary. Better take points at C1 or G8.];B[ga]
;W[fa];B[gb];W[ci]C[B: danger at E8! Better to defend there.]

(;B[ei]C[B: E8 is bigger.];W[eb]C[B: phew. Black could have played there.]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[B: interesting game. Although black played more at the cutting points of white, black could have played a bit more aggresively, I think.
And for white: be aware of your cutting points.])

(;B[gb];W[hd];B[eb];W[hb];B[hc];W[ic];B[fa];W[he];B[hf];W[ha]
;B[ie]))
(;W[hd];B[hc];W[he];B[hf]))
(;W[gc];B[fb]C[B: it's whites move now. Black has 3 liberties. White groups both have 3 liberties, so should be ok.]
;W[gb];B[eb];W[db]))
(;B[ch];W[di];B[ci]C[B: nowhere to run.]))
(;B[cg];W[hg];B[fi]LB[hg:A]C[B: white group A has no room to live.]
))
(;W[dg]CR[hf][hg][gh][hh]TR[bf][cf][bg][cg][bh][ch][dh]C[B: protect the left side and give the right side to black.]
;B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[eh]))
(;W[de]C[B: ignoring the situation at E4 for a moment, D5 is better than D7 because it connects your stones. They are stronger together and it makes it easier to attack with them.]
))
(;W[ef]LB[ge:A]C[B: black will now play at B to defend, or white can play there to cut off the black stone.]
;B[ge];W[gc]C[B: and it is even possible to invade the corner.]
)
(;W[ge]C[B: or cut black. Which makes it a bit complicated.]
;B[ef];W[hf];B[eg];W[cg]LB[gc:B][ce:A]C[B: white can claim the corner, black will play around A or B to get some territory at the top. Better for black, I think.]
