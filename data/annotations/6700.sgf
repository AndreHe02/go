I> Hello!
The review was requested for Black, HsHyun 22k.
I will put my comments after "I>".

Overall: the reviewed game has only 65 moves, it's barely got to the midgame. Black tried to fight from the very beginning while White played calmly for territory.
The winners in go are usually those who balance between claiming territory and making strong groups. Engaging in fighting so early in the game serves neither of these purposes and finally leads to a disaster, especially against a stronger player.
What I recommend to you is just to play more games to understand what to secure a corner and a side is, and how that affects the final score.

(;B[ng]C[I> If you want to improve your skills at go, try to play in a more traditional way: secure corners first then sides. The first move by White allowed you to secure UR corner in a handful of ways, see variations.
This and the following moves by Black indicate a wish to surround the very first White stone and White group. But the game of go isn't about surrounding only. It is about balance.]

I> You are trying to save a hopeless stone. Again, at this stage of the game, you should pay more attention to strategy, i. e. defining your (future) sphere of influence.]

;W[se];B[qe];W[sh];B[oe];W[pf]
(;B[oh]C[I> This is also a very reckless attempt to threaten the invincible White group. Most obviously, this Black stone is cut at O12. Locally, a better move was R16.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[qd]
(;B[rd]C[I> Q17 would be a good shape move.];W[re];B[qc]TR[rd]
[pd]C[I> Threatening R16 gives absolutely nothing, Notice how weak are your stones Q16, R17 and pathetic S16 compared with the solid White formation.]
;W[od]C[I> White didn't even pay attention to your atari, and preferred an intrusion to the upper side of the board.]
;B[qe]C[I> Again, pointless (worth 1 point, to be precise). Nothing threatened, nothing fortified, nothing expanded.]
;W[pm]C[I> White siwtched for territory here from the UR corner.]
;B[ol]C[I> You are playing from the top. This gives you influence but no territory. To exploit influence, you must be a skilled player. If not, then playing for territory is much more secure.]

;W[cm];B[do];W[co]C[I> D10 is very important now, since three Black stones D11-13 are threatened.]

(;B[cp];W[dj];B[eh];W[ej];B[fg];W[fj]C[I> A horrible intrusion!]
;B[gi]
(;W[gj]C[I> A very cautious move, F8 is better];B[hj];W[gl]
C[I> The game ends here. I wouldn't say it's lost for Black. However, if we take a look at the board we'll see that White formations are much stronger than weak, scattered Black ones. Notice that both White "armies" have a solid ground at the left and right edges of the board. White still can easily invade the bottom, as well as UL and the top.

*Notice*
You asked about Life and Death. As for that, nothing tricky has appeared in this game. Simply playing more games will make you understand the basic Life and Death.]
