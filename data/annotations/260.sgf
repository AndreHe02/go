(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[Comments Feb 1996 by  Erik Ekholm (EE) for the Go teaching  ladder on request by Neil Mitchison (NM), who played White in this game.

I was very glad to see that you played much better here than  you did in the last game I reviewed (234-erik-Niall-cloy.sgf). You played
with more  patience and fewer overplays.

Both players missed big double sente points. In a game like  this with many small strong groups, the endgame is often decisive  and getting the big points along the edges is important.]

[IGS:  igs.nuri.net 6969]KM[5.5];B[pd]C[NM: Although  I ended up winning it, I thought it was somewhat  unsatisfactory, in that I was under the impression (was I right?)  of being well ahead at the end of the fuseki, having managed to  make a couple of valuable extensions in sente, and although I  don't think I made major errors thereafter, I only won by 3.5 points  (less than the komi!).  Now my opponent had strong formations which  were  difficult to attack, and so I didn't go in for any agressive attacking
(an error?), but my real question, in a sense, is "was I more than 3.5
points ahead at the end of the fuseki, and if so where did I squander it?"]
;W[po]C[EE: Black made some mistakes in the fuseki, which let White
take a lead of 10-15 points. White kept his lead until  #76, when he  did a far too deep reduction, which gave Black the initiative. This  adventure costed White maybe 6-9 points, but could have costed much
 more; the rest of the advantage, down to 3.5, was lost in the later  endgame.

It was correct to avoid aggressive attacking, since there is no (honest)  way to attack a strong group, it is only a waste of time. Just playing  solidly and taking big points might seem lukewarm to the notorious  fighter, but it's really the best way to keep a safe lead in this  kind of game.]
;B[cp];W[ep];B[dn];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[br];W[iq];B[dc]L[bo][cj][cl]
M[br]C[EE: When Black has played the marked stone  instead of 'a', he must finish the joseki with 'b'. Now, he's got  a weak point at 'c' for White to aim at. I'm not sure, but White  might consider playing 'c' directly.]
;W[ce]L[ci]C[EE: *Maybe* this  should be high, since Black might get a good result with the  dual-purpose move of 'a': pincering and at the same time mending  his weak spot. With the high kakari, a pincer at 'a' doesn't "exist".]
;B[de]L[jc]C[EE: This is unusual and probably bad here.  It can be considered in situations when there is a Black  stone around 'a', when building up a black moyo compensates  the strengthening of White.]
;W[df];B[ee];W[cd];B[cc];W[ci];B[fc]L[jc]C[EE:  'a' is joseki. But in either case, Black ends in gote,  which means White gets to play first on the urgent left side.]
;W[cl]C[EE:  Superb point! Very good, Neil.];B[bm];W[kd]L[kc][pq]C
[EE: This is a good  region to play in, nullifying the influence  Black has built up. Whether #22 or 'a' is better is hard for me  to say. 'a' is easier to settle, but #22 is lighter. Making a  shimari at 'b' could also be considered.]
;B[pq]
(;W[qq]C[EE: Since this game  seems to develop towards a small-scale game,  emphasising territory like this is probably a good choice.
See the variation for an alternative, not necessarily better,  line of play.]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[qk];B[np];W[nc];B[qg]C[
 Niall 9k*: are you getting bad netlag? I am];W[pb];B[qc];W[lq]C[EE: Good extension!]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[qi]L[id]C[EE: Black  neglects the natural reply at 'a'. It remains  a good point for both players.]
;W[ok]C[EE: Okay, lets take a  look at the balance of territories:

White: left 13 + top 12 + bottom 13 + right 14 + komi 5.5 = 57.5

Black: top 15 + right 15 + bottom 5 + left 9 = 44

Even considering that it is Black's move next, and that my counting  is inaccurate, White seems to have a comfortable lead: that is, more  than 3.5 points :-).

All groups seem safe and most territories have limited scope for  expansion. In these kind of games, the center is often uninteresting  and the endgame starts early with the players competing for the big  points around the edges.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[qb]L[mq]C[EE: White  should play 'a', which is the normal tsuke-nobi pattern (just like  in the top left corner). Black isn't properly connected, so he will  probably have to add a stone, giving White sente.]
;B[mq]C[EE: Good,  Black penalises White immediately, getting good shape and keeping  sente.]
;W[lr];B[nh]L[rj][bl]C[EE: What is this move supposed to do??  No side can count on making a significant amount of points in the center  and there are no weak groups to attack either. A wasted move, IMHO. 'a'  and 'b' look more interesting and those are good points for  White too.]
;W[qe]L[rc]C[EE: Most likely an overplay. The way Black  answers it, everything is fine, but what if Black resists with 'a'?  If White runs out, pushing Black along the 16th line, the white  position at the top is bound to get hurt. And O12 will have a purpose  after all. Creating confusion like this is *not* the way to guide a  lead into victory, it just gives Black a chance to come back in the  game. White should just calmly play big, solid endgame moves and  leave it up to Black to try something desperate.]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[pf];W[rc];B[rg];W[qd];B[pc];W[rd]L[oc]C[EE: I think Wa is a better  reinforcement, since Black might try something at the top, now that  he got strong from the invasion.]
;B[rr];W[nn]C[NM: Or should I have  attacked at P13?
EE: Black has got forcing moves against the top, so I don't think it  is a good idea. Remember you are leading - even more so after Black's  weak play after your invasion - and should play THICK.]
;B[me];W[md];B[ib];W[jb]L[bl]C[EE: Wa might be better.];B[ie];W[le];B
[bc]L[cg][ef]C[NM: I think  I should have answered that with  F13!
EE: No, it doesn't work, as the variation shows. But I agree B16  can be questioned. I'm not sure how to play in this situation.  Maybe 'a' or 'b'?]

(;W[bd];B[dg];W[cg];B[ef];W[cf];B[dh];W[di];B[fh];W[bl]C[NM: Should this have been C7?
EE: C7 is the kind of move (push into a keima) that can be aji-keshi,  so it shouldn't be played until right before there is a risk that the  opponent plays there himself to eliminate the push. That time doesn't  seem too far away, though, and I can't see any particularly juicy   aji that White destroys, so I think it would have been okay to push  there.]
;B[rj]L[ia][ja]M[rr]C[NM: Shoud I have gone C5?
EE: C5 doesn't look urgent to me. Wa/Bb on the other hand should be  double sente, which means free profit for the colour that takes it  first. S9, albeit solid and nice, isn't as big as it first appears  to be, since the white territory there is already undercut by the  marked stone.]
;W[rk];B[cm];W[hg]L[ia][ja][am][al]C[EE: Too deep and  far away from friendly positions, you don't need this! Firstly, Black's  area here is quite narrow, so you shouldn't deny him a few points  here. Secondly, you are well ahead: Assume that Black gets to play  H13 instead, then we get:
White: top 21+ left 12 + right 14 + bottom 16 + komi 5.5 = 68.5
Black top 26 + right 8 + bottom 8 + left 10 = 52
Thirdly, the double sente points a/b and c/d are more urgent.];B[jg]C[EE: Now  I think you agree that H13 was too deep, no? When White  runs the gauntlet to save his stone, Black can take the initiative.  Maybe to simply desert H13 here and now, admitting it was an  overplay, is best...]

 Niall 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[hp];B[cs];W[go]C[EE: White's bottom territory is devastated, and  White's center stones aren't in the clear yet.]
;B[gf]L[gj]C[EE: This  feels too defensive, Black should continue to harass White's weak  stones. Maybe by cutting at 'a'.]
;W[gr]L[ik]C[EE: White has no time  for this, he should protect his cutting point in the center and play  something like 'a'.]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[gj];W[hj];B[gh]L[hk]C[EE: Why  doesn't Black cut at 'a'?]
;W[hl]C[EE: Good!];B[hh];W[ih];B[ig];W[jh]M[nh][lo]L[ia][am]C[EE: Too small, better to treat J12 as kikashi  and sacrifice it if necessary. The two triangled black stones makes  white center profit unlikely. The double sente points 'a' and 'b'  are waiting for attention.]
