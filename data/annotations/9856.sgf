;B[qf]C[Dear reviewer,

I have written a few comments into the game and would be very happy if you reviewed for black.

The thing that presently bothers me most in my gameplay is that I often feel like going out of the opening with quite some disadvantage and then still win.

Can you shed some light on this, i.e., whether I really have a bad position after the opening?

Here I wanted to try the moves you see in the first variation, but my opponent didn't make it possible.





Answer:

The white position, after the opening, looked impressive. However, there were a lot of weaknesses. There was no big framework nicely working together, there were a lot of holes where Black could sneak through. Black, on the other hand, had solid territory. 
The biggest problem for White was the start of the entire fight in the lower right. White wanted to keep both corner and prevent Black from getting the side. White was in no position to get both, so the strategy would not work, and Black could get a big advantage from it.
At move 43, Black then made the error of establishing 2 weak groups instead of trying to connect them. However, White was not able to make use of this. Before the endgame started, Black was ahead by about 15 points.

In the endgame (starting from about move 127) it was clear that Black played a much stronger endgame than White. This was probably worth 20 points, at least. A lot of small mistakes quickly add up.]

(;B[fp]C[Answer to your question:

This move does not cut the white stones. It also does not really succeed in flattening the white position.
It might be better to extend to the other side, for example to D8. That way, White will later need to come back to reinforce this position, and otherwise you can get some advantage out of the loose position. The move you played strengthens the white position without getting much in return.

Just consider what happens if White plays F4 instead of Black (and White connecting underneath). The white position would be a bit higher, and you would probably extend on the left side, and white would tr to push the black stones down (see variation). There would be nothing really disastrous about this.

Now, if Black already has that extension, White will not be able to get even that. See the second variation.]
;W[fq];B[cl]C[Black still gets the extension, but now White is stronger on the bottom.]

(;B[jd];W[dj];B[cp]C[This move actually enables a strong attack on the white stones in the bottom left. See variation later.]

(;B[qn]C[Shoud I have gone into the bottom left corner first (variation)? Or played higher (variation)?


To summarize my answer:
G3 would be big, but gote. This move is big. Whether or not it is sente will depend on the variations followed.
If White chooses to ignore this move, White can get part of the bottom left corner]

(;W[qo];B[pn]
(;W[pj]C[White wants both corner and prevent the black extension. Black can now do something: threaten the corner to reinforce the stones at Q6, and then attack Q10.
If White wanted to prevent a black position on this side, White should have pincered at R8 after Black R6.]

(;B[qk]C[This is what White wanted: Black gets a smaller position, White gets the corner.]
;W[qj]C[Overly aggressive play by White. White needs to choose what they want; corner or side.]

;W[hq];B[ir];W[hr]SQ[ir]C[Here I decided to take the bottom. Is that already dangerous for my group arounf r6..r9?




Answer:

The effect of the marked exchange is that the white bottom left corner is now much stronger. The black group at the bottom is small. There won't be many points here, so the crucial thing is not to get sealed in. The stones around r6 need some defending, but they can still get away.]

SQ[rl]C[Could I have played this better since white s8? I basically sacrificed stones to connect two groups, and then attack (next move)


Answer: you connected your 2 weak groups. Sacrificing 4 stones is a very small price. This sequence was played well. I tried out different variations, and did not find anything much better. It's hard to review big tactical fights like this, but I did not spot any crucial errors.]

(;B[cj]C[Is this better than the variation? I think yes.


Answer:
Yes. The key thing is that the white group at D3 already lives, so a move at B2 is only a handful of points without strategical advantage.
However, the attachment invites White to strengthen their position. Look at variations]
