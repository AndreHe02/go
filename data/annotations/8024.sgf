RE[B+6.5]

C[WOG: thanks for sending this game for review.  My general comments are:

- if it's possible to punish right away, effectively, then do it
- if you're going to play away because you don't know the best move, the playing away needs to be "away" from the field of battle
- White's being too submissive in a number of places

There's a TON to read in this game!  It's an entire problem book unto itself.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[WOG: I see White wants to break the usual fuseki pattern. :)]
(;B[qo]C[WOG: poor choice in joseki, IMHO.  When there's a friend above, the proper joseki is to attack with a pincer. That's not to say this is completely wrong, just against the principle of attacking when you have an advantage to.]
;W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[qf]C[WOG: You give up a chance for punishing Black's poor choice of joseki directly. Again, is this wrong?  No, not necessarily.  Just that it's clearer to finish the joseki and show the errs of Black's ways.]
;B[pj]C[I didn't really know what to answer to this move.
So I jump into the corner and left some aji on the side.

Is it the correct move ?

WOG: the correct move is a hard question to answer.  Go is a mystery.  That said, if it were my game, I wouldn't make Black stronger in an area where I have so many stones unsettled.  See variation to your moves.]
(;W[qc]C[WOG: seems like you leave the field of play to take territory.  This isn't really leaving things alone here, it's strengthening Black in an area you don't want Black to be stronger in.

A good rule to remember, especially early in the game, is to "play away when you don't know what to do.". This White 10 is not playing away.  Playing away would be playing in the remaining open corner.]
;B[qd]C[WOG: now, Black strengthens in an area where White would prefer Black not be stronger.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]
(;B[ql]C[WOG: Black is leaving the joseki unfinished here is a bit dangerous and this move by Black doesn't really help locally as much at it could.  See variations]
(;W[dd]C[WOG: skips opportunity to punish Black going away from settling the shape in the upper right.]
;B[me]C[WOG: now Black gets to settle things first]
(;W[mc]C[WOG: Black settles in sente the missed opportunity for White, but still a little loose for Black; not as solid as it could be.  Moreover, White doesn't need to answer here.]
;B[fq];W[iq]C[WOG: why pincer?  Usually don't pincer when you don't have friends to back you up.]
(;B[cq]C[WOG: Black misses the opportunity to punish the White pincer.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[em];B[cm]
C[WOG: White erases some of the right side's influence in sente and helps reduce the situation for Black on the right... bad choice for Black]
;W[oq]C[WOG: this move surprised me!];B[or]C[Maybe the O2 hane is better on this case ?]
(;W[nq];B[nr];W[mq]C[WOG: Black territory on the second line isn't so bad but sharing the corner leaves more aji]
;B[pp]C[WOG: big];W[cf];B[db];W[dc];B[eb];W[cb]
(;B[gc]C[WOG: this extension is too short!  Black needs to play lighter in White's domain]
;W[jc];B[ge];W[hd]C[WOG: why peep?  Rule: "Don't peep at random".  Why?  It's aji keshi.  Maybe later wedge is better.]
;B[he]
(;W[id]C[WOG: very small and dame.  See variation.];B[gd]C[WOG: White's worse off in this peep exchange.  Tewari would show that playing j16 is terrible in relation to h15]
;W[jf]C[WOG: Could have played here without peeping];B[hh]
(;W[jh]LB[hj:A]C[Is it the correct direction or should I play A instead ?

WOG: this way helps invade the right side better than the cap but the cap helps secure more territory for White.  The key, of course, is to count both scenarios and play accordingly.  Strategically, I think the target on the right is better than preserving the capacity for territory on the bottom.  Before playing here, you can probe first.]

Where is the big move ?

WOG: pretty big move this one but a bit amorphous but good thinking nonetheless - ladder breaker and reduces.  It points at the black stones in the middle but is not as practical as other variations.

For every consideration, unfortunately, the right yardstick is to count.]
;B[es]C[WOG: Black plays where White should have];W[gq];B[jk]
LB[ek:B][ik:A]C[Sacrifice A and play B is a good choice ?

WOG: saving A raises the issue of the cut enabled by your prior move]
