C[Xris: Hi, I would like to know what the fatal flaws of my game were. I am not quite sure what area to concentrate on next in my studies. So general comments about the style would be very helpful. I prefixed all my questions and comments on the game with "Xris: ". Thank you very much in advance.

Xris

Hi Xris,
My name is Allan Wickberg and I will review this game. My rank may be around 15k, so I am not an expert, but maybe I can give you some advice.
My comments will be marked "al>".];B[pc];W[dc];B[dq];W[do]C[Xris: Is W4 really the best move to make? since this is a fighting game, i think now it would have been more important to take the lower right hoshi.

al> Not necessarily. If black goes for the right corner you will have better chances to attack him on the left, and vice versa.]
;B[qq];W[fp]C[al> But this may be a little too kind to black. It depends on if white is trying to attack black, or going for influence towards the center. To attack black, I would think that c3 or e3 are more aggressive, forcing black to answer. With w f4, black may even be free to play elsewhere.]
;B[ce];W[ed]C[al> With e16, the white stones are too close together, and open for attack, niether creating eye space nor staking out territory. f16, g16, or g17 are possible defensive moves, and d15 is a move I would use for intimidating black.]
;B[op]LB[ro:a]C[al> c11 would be a natural move for black, I think. p4 does not achieve much in terms of territory or attack, and the black stone at c15 is under some pressure from white - if I was black, I would be disturbed by w d14, for instance.]
;W[pe]C[al> Locally, in the top right corner, this is OK, but give the white stones in the top left corner, I think it woud be better to attack from the left instead, making claims along the top. Fighting game, or not, in the end it is territory that counts (unless you manage to clobber  a really large group, maybe).]
;B[ep]
(;W[iq]C[al> I can not really tell why, but this feels like bad shape to me. It would be natural to answer with w e5, and using the attack as a means to build a wall. The f4 stone can then be exchanged for a strong position along the left side, making the black stone at c15 to appear weak. The trick will be to come out ahead of black from the lower corner, and trap c15 with w c13 or similar. See variation.]
;B[ci]C[al> OK, so now it is the white stone at d5 that appears weak, although I would rather have played  c12 as black, becase of the white stones on top. A little safer.]
;W[qd]C[al> Again, this really feels like it is on the wrong side of black q17. Black can easily get out and nibble away on white's potential territory along the top. Besides, white has a vunerable stone at d5 to take care of, either by connecting to the other white stones nearby, or by pushing down on the left of black, to find life along the left side.]
;B[fr]C[al> It is hard for me to see what black wants with this move. I would imagine the it would be more interesting to cut off the d5 stone instead.]
;W[gq]C[al> I can see several disadvantages with w g3: It does not really attack the black stones, it is too close together with the other white stones, making for a "heavy" pattern, it does not pull out the d5 stone, and it does not create enough space for territory. W m3 would build a safe group within black's domain along the bottom. W c8 might do the same along the left side. I might have tried w f3, just to see what would happen :)]
;B[ld];W[jc]C[al> It is the right answer, but my gut wants the white stone at j17, or even h17, instead. This would make it harder for black to split the white group. I would dread b h17 for next move. But then, maybe I am too chicken :)]
;B[od];W[qi]C[al> Yes, this feels like a good answer by white.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[dp]MA[eo]C[Xris: Would it have been more important to seal of black or to create a base (as with w24)?

al> I think it is possible to do both, by starting with w e5. If black pushed through, white can hunt the black stone while both extending along the bottom and building a base along the left side. Although...]
;W[ck]C[al> ...I feel that w c9 should be at c8 instead. Things could get troublesome if black would answer with c7 now, due to the cutting point at e5.]
;B[lq];W[ql];B[de]C[Xris: Is it necessary to answer this?

al> No, it is not so threatening. Black e5 would be..];W[ee]
C[Xris: Now that the opening is as good as finished, I think black has an advantage since two corners are black and 2 are undecided. would it have been more important to secure at least one corner or to push black in.

al> "Urgent before big" - the lower white group looks a little cramped, and can find itself in a lot of trouble if black attacks it. White looks slightly ahead in potential territory, provided that group can stay alive. The group is not immediately threatened, though, so it might be time to attack black's top right group first. Cutting under it, around m18, would at least serve the purpose of strengthening white's upper group, if not killing black. Again, it is important to get out of that possible fight ahead, so black does not get the chance to strike at the lower white group first.]
;B[ef];W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[dg];W[ge]C[al> "stay away from thickness"; it is better to play closer to the single stone at k17 - the connected stones are not the ones needing reinforcement.]
;B[qn];W[lc];B[mh];W[je]C[al> Better to keep pushing with w o17, I think. This is not so threatening for black, and gives him the chance to play n17, which almost settles the group.]

;B[fn];W[hn];B[go];W[gp];B[eo];W[gn];B[gm];W[ho]C[Xris: Now its really evident what damage black could do by using the gap I left him.

al> Yes, e5 was a critical point for both players. But the game is not lost here.]

C[al> White should have played j11 instead. Then the three black stones would have been in trouble. NOw it turned out the other way around.]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[ii];W[ei];B[ij]C[Xris: Was sacrificing 3 stones important enough to secure the left and top group?

al> Both groups should have been able to live without the sacrifice. Now black gets a lot more points in the center, and likely, the game. Move #107 was the pivot, to my eyes.]
;W[hg];B[rb];W[rc];B[qc];W[re];B[rm];W[rl];B[cb];W[db];B[ao]
;W[jq]C[al> Thanks to the capture in the center, black seems to be in the lead. "If you are leading, try to increase your territory - if you are behind, try to destroy your opponent's territory" (or something). So, white should try to step out in the middle, destroying points for black, instead of trying to build territory along the edge.]
;B[jn];W[kr];B[ca];W[da];B[bb];W[kq];B[kp];W[ns]C[Xris: Is the monkey jump too early? I thought I can take about 20 pts from him if black doesnt answer. Since white is loosing by about 30 pts this should have been the only chance left on the board i think.

al> Since black's next logical move would have been m2, I think the time was right. But jumping out in the board from the right is also an option for decreasing black's moyo.]

[kp][jp][jo][jn]C[Xris: Trying to attack the marked group was maybe futile but I am not sure. Maybe there is a way to kill it?

al> No, it is too easy to defend by connecting it.];B[am];W[an]
C[Xris: Very stupid mistake. I should have seen it, but I was worried about killing the group on the bottom right.]
