C[Hi there =) I'm black in this game, and although I lost, I think it was an enjoyable game.

I would appreciate if the reviewer could look on my errors and where I can improve ;) I will try to ask questions along the way.


hi, my name is terence. i will put t. before each of my comments]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[do]C[I wasn't sure here, but I chose to kakari the 3-4 stone.

t.     this is fine, approaching this stone is probably the most important move but at this stage there are many possibilities so dont think about it too much]
;W[cm];B[en];W[fp];B[dl];W[bk]C[t.   this is a bad move by white and should certainly be punished]

(;B[cn]C[I tried to put pressure on white's group here, but I wasn't sure if this was the right way to do it.


t. this is not the best since it allows w out along the side]

(;W[dm];B[em]LB[dm:A][cn:B]C[t.     things get crazy here and there are many variations. A does exploit the weakness of B, but w has pretty bad shape.]
;W[cl];B[dk];W[di]
(;B[ck]C[t. this move has a bad feeling to it (apologies i cant explain that better)]
;W[cj]
(;B[ch]TR[el][dn]C[t.    this leaves behind way too many cutting points in your shape, and your group is now weak]
;W[cf]C[t. this is also an overplay];B[dg];W[df]

;B[bl];W[bi];B[ak];W[ai];B[eh];W[fg];B[dj];W[ci];B[bj];W[ei]
SQ[eh]C[t.      w is aliove and connected so there is no point in saving the marked stone]

(;B[fh];W[gg];B[gf];W[hg];B[hf];W[ec];B[gc];W[fd];B[gd];W[if]

(;B[ie];W[ee];B[je];W[lc];B[nc];W[jc];B[ic]LB[le:A]C[t. this is the problem move here, i think cap at A is more important.]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[le]C[t. because you did not cap white was able to escape with nice shape and now there is no good move for attacking w]
;B[ld]C[This was probably a stupid move, as I let him connect out.
At the same time, I felt L16 was a bit passive.];W[kd];B[md]
