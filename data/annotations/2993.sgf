C[I am pto, 6 kyu from Finland. My playing style is agressive and I am far from a book learner. This was guite difficult game for me to comment, but I did my best.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[po]LB[pq:1][qq:2]C[To this point this is standard fuseki. Philosophy behind high moves like 5-4 is to concentrate on edge and center areas. White allmost inviter black to invade.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[dk];W[kq]LB[pg:3][fp:1][fq:2]C[This move is difficult for me to judge. Playing here makes white perhaps too contertrated on this side but wihtout this move, white could run into serious troubles.

So perhaps move at 1 should be in 2, then this move vould be played somewhere around 3. Then black and white are in balance.]
;B[jd];W[qj];B[qg];W[qm]LB[cf:2][pq:1]TR[qj][po]C[Better at O3 or C13?

I like this move because it fortifies the left side. Now marked three stones have nice solid shape that only waits 1 to become huge teritory. 

This move is slow, but black upper area is not too strong yet.

O3 seems a bit funny. Move around C14 is huge.];B[pq]TR[qj]
[qm][po]C[From now, white main aim should be to gain sente and go to upper corner. Tenuki here is one posibility because marked white stones are strong.]
;W[oq];B[qp];W[pp];B[pr];W[or];B[rr]LB[op:A]C[There is nasty cut at A.]
;W[nc]LB[cf:1]TR[jd][dk]C[Better play at N17?

I think that it would be better to play at 1. Reason is, that there marked black stone doesn't pincer white. Here it is in wery difficult position.

White will now have a weak group to defend. This will lead black wall that will make upper left corner huge.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf]TR[qg]C[This black move makes black a bit overconcentrated. Marked stones are too strong.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[ke];W[le];B[lf];W[kf];B[je];W[mf];B[lg]
;W[md]C[Now white is barely alive and black has moyo around upper left hoshi.]
;B[jg];W[mg]LB[cf:1]C[Is it better to make shape with O14/13?

This is painfull, but safety first. This is nice move, that makes escape easier. This is better than shape moves, because you don't realy wan't just to live there.]
;B[lh];W[en]LB[cc:1][cf:2]TR[lf][jg][lg][lh]C[This was small.

Before black got central influence, this would have been huge, but now black can detroy white moyo very easily.

Go for the corner. Play at 1 if you don't dare anything else. Black influence makes moves around 2 somehow dangerous.]
;B[bp];W[cq]TR[dd]C[Think about corner balance: 
Black has one big, one small, one shared and one open. White has only one shared.

Side balance:
Black has one huge, one invaded and one shared. White has one shared, one invasion and one huge.

Central balance is even.

White has to do something around marked stone. I don't like teritory sharing games, where players build a wall across the goban and decide result in endgame. I think go is about spirit and courage. Go against the marked black stone.]
;B[cg]LB[cc:1][cf:2]C[Oh, now the door is closed. The invasion at 1 should still work. If black had played at 2 this invasion would lead to ko.]
;W[el];B[dl];W[fj];B[fg];W[eh];B[eg];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[cj]
;W[lj]LB[hj:3][jj:1][oj:2][ek:4][em:5]C[Whats the best way to secure my moyo here?

There is no best way. Black and white are guite even, but black teritory is stronger. Black has at least five options to use to reduce.]
;B[jj];W[ki];B[ji]LB[hj:1]C[Perhaps black should play around 1.]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[ih];W[ig];B[hh];W[jf];B[if];W[hj];B[ii]
;W[jl];B[ik];W[jk];B[hk];W[gk];B[ij];W[hm];B[mi];W[mj];B[hl]
;W[gl];B[ek];W[em];B[kj];W[kk];B[li];W[bq]C[White got huge succes. This is about as big as this moyo can be. It should have fallen into peaces.]
;B[cp];W[bo];B[co];W[ap];B[bn]C[too small for thsi stage?

Yes, this is yose sequence. Go for the corner.];W[ao];B[an]
;W[aq];B[do];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[im];W[il];B[hn];W[gm];B[in]
;W[jo];B[km]C[This is very nice from black, odds are for white and black is helping to finish those walls and is givin stones as present.

Black allready has played reduction moves. After those moves white teritory becomes smaller but stronger. One good role of thumb is to play either reduction or invasion but not both.

Reduction after invasion and invasion after reduction doesn't usuelly work.]

;W[pi]C[Better at S12 first?

This is end game. Go for the corner.];B[ni];W[ej];B[ci];W[dg]
LB[cc:B][df:A]C[NOOOOO!!! You don't want to have black stone at A! After that invasion at B becomes much more difficult.

Think what would have happened if you had played at A? If black cuts, invasion at B will he huge success. If black protects from that, you have a work inside black teritory.]
;B[df];W[fk]C[How many points this was? Was there a cut?];B[ri]
;W[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[dm]LB[ja:2][kb:1]C[Nice and big, but gote. Play sente moves first. Move at 1 should be sente. And then if black plays at K18 move at 2 should be sente too.]
;B[qi];W[nf]C[Ugly shape, but now it should be alive.];B[og]
;W[pc]LB[qc:1]TR[pf][qg]C[It did work out, but felt more like luck to me? What would e the best attack in that area?

Strong players play often at 1 but here black has strength that may make it difficult. Black shape has weaknesses so this is not pure luck.]
;B[pb];W[qc];B[ob];W[qb];B[rd]LB[od:1][re:2]C[Black should connect at 1. White may live with 2, but black kills the white group. I don't see any way to live with both of these groups.

Note that after connection black at O15 falsifies one white eye.]
;W[od]TR[ob][pb][oc]C[Here black is dead.];B[qa];W[nb];B[qd]
;W[oa];B[kb];W[lc]LB[lb:A]C[No reason not to play at A.];B[lb]

LB[sl:1][om:2]C[Play first at 1 and then at 2. Then black would gain four point less from here.]

;W[di]LB[db:2][cc:1][dc:3]C[Could white still live at C17 or D17?

I dont know. Ko threats seem to be in favor of white (something 5 to 1) so it worth a shot. Nothing to lose anyway.

You will gain nothing if I put a long variation here but think how things develop if white starts in either 1, 2 or 3.]

Have a bit more courage to explore the unknown. That is what go is about for us amateur players.

The simple move at D13 was huge mistake. Pushing and thus missing future opportunities is very bad habit.

Count a bit more in simple situations - it will give you a point here and another there. It is enough to torn games.

Have fun.])
