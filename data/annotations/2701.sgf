C[hello, I lost the game (as white) for 10,5 points.

I included some questions and comments when I feel I could have made better. I would be grateful if you could add some advice

an interesting game, I added whatever comments and variations I could, but I am a firm believer that nobody really understands this game, so feel free to take my comments lightly :-)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qo]C[I don't like to let black the right side in this kind of beginning, some I often invade (sometimes at R9)

probably R9 is playable but I think playing the corner first as you did is better.
incedentally, if you want to avoid this sort of right side though, you can approach r16 instead of playing d16. typically approaching an unfinished corner (non-symmetrical point like 3-4 or 3-5) is considered as valuable as an open corner, so its not breaking any "rule" to not play the open corner :)]
;B[qm];W[op]C[I expected black to cut at Q4

The Q4 cut is the only joseki I know for this, but I hardly know any joseki anyway, I think how black played is playable as well]
;B[oq];W[np];B[mq]
(;W[qj]C[I'm not sure about this one, I'm worried you are making two weak groups. mabye you should jump to m5 first, since it has nice followup at m3 if black ignores.
there is another option to play to get r3 in sente first as well]
;B[qq];W[mp];B[lq]
(;W[po]C[I didn't want black to connect under

A valid worry I think, but q5 seems that it must be too slow a method, to be honest, I'm not sure I can see a very good way here, mabye p7 works, I have it showed in the variation. r6 and s4 mabye work to, but they seem bad to me]
;B[cn];W[fq]C[I think you should pincer here, with M3 as it is you dont want to emphasise the bottom at all so the pincer would be better]
;B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[qg];B[fc];W[cg]C[I'm not sure about this extention, mabye its fine, but you do have to be careful since it has more weak points than the shorter one, and that came up later in the game]
;B[jd]
(;W[iq]C[I think I might do something to hurt the R7 stone here instead, it still has alot of aji.mabye even just q8]
;B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[pl];B[og]C[I'm not sure it's good for me : black is getting great power outside

white has interesting reducing move at R15]
(;W[hc]C[maybe it was not the good way to reduce black : it give him hte opportunity to close the upper right ... but I didn't see anything better

d18 or d17 is a good preparation to this kind of move, its also big to help your corner like that. its also possible to play K10 here and still mabye have invasion like k17 later]
;B[hd]
(;W[gc]C[I dont like this direction, feels like pushing him onto your corner, mabye you can play K17 or J17 instead]
;B[gd];W[fb];B[ic];W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[ib]C[j18 feels like endgame move];B[jb];W[hb];B[fg]C[I knew it ... now I have to do something to reduce black

yes, probably];W[jj]C[this is fine];B[ko];W[mm]C[I was quite happy with that

rightly so];B[km];W[mk];B[nl];W[ml];B[nm];W[ol]C[this push is essentially meaningless, it hurt a liberty, and put a black stone at o9 that got in your way later]
;B[nk];W[nn];B[om];W[pm];B[on];W[mn];B[jg];W[oh]C[I wanted to attack black's 7 stones on the right

not bad idea, mabye attach p14 first];B[nh]C[maybe O13 then P14 is good now for white

yes, I think so]
(;W[oi];B[ni]C[now we see o9 stone in just the right place]
;W[mj]C[dangerous peep, but you saw why yourself];B[pj];W[qi]

;B[qf];W[rf];B[pg];W[qh];B[rp];W[ro];B[ci];W[lp]C[this was good for me, wasn't it ?

yes, I think its good];B[kp];W[kq];B[hn];W[bq]C[I should have wait. E6 was better, I see it now

mabye, e6 is big, but as long as k10 is safe and d12 is open, black has hard time making something big there]
;B[nq]
(;W[jq];B[hp];W[hq];B[fn]
(;W[dn]C[I dont think this move is good, it leads to a bad shape....]
;B[dm];W[en];B[em]TR[cn][fn]C[black has hane at head and foot of two white stones, a shape to be avoided]
;W[fm]C[bad cut, better to reduce from k10];B[fo];W[ep];B[hk]
C[now it's bad for white, black is too strong in the center. I missed a big opportunity to reduce the center, from the outside

yes];W[fl];B[ek];W[jn];B[jm];W[kn];B[in];W[jo];B[kk];W[kj];B[lj]

;B[dj];W[eh];B[fh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[cf]C[A good move for black. Is there a better answer than mine ?
after this, there is nothing of particular interest

I think its just a good move, the way you played is all I can see]

(;W[qe]C[mabye this should not be played yet, but combined with P14, its an interesting way to get into black area, look through the variations, they range from simple to total madness, but the point is that black is not so thick in the area, so its not difficult to bust in in principle, you mabye jsut have to find the right move]
