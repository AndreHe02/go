AB[pd][dp]C[Hello!   My rank is 25k* on IGS. I played white on this map against
30k. And I win +0.5 point.    But black played very strange, he really scared me! :)   So I need to know where I played wrong, especially in the beginning.

Thanks.  Game Name: trustme-siegfriet(B) IGS Black Rank: 30k
Write Rank: 25k*   Steve: I have commented on several moves.  I have also added
several
variations.  Be sure your *.sgf viewer can show variations.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[eq];W[fp];B[eo];W[jp];B[dj]C[Black seems to have a lot of territory in the lower left corner
from this exchange, but his corner is still open to a 3x3 point
invasion.]
(;W[fc]C[trustme: Is it good point? Or I shoud try to reduce black's left
side with C14?   This is reasonable.  Black will probably strengthen the left
side during this exchange, but White should secure a similar
area along the top in exchange.  White could also invade at C7
(shown in a later variation) or at C3 (shown in this variation.)]
;B[fd]
(;W[gd]C[There are several ways to respond to Black's move.  White has
played one good option, but two others are shown in variations.
How white responds depends on what White wants to accomplish.
The current move means White wants to get territory on the top.
A White play at C14 would be intended to reduce Black's left
side.  A White play at C17 means White wants the corner and is
willing to give Black outside influence in exchange.];B[ec]
;W[gc]C[A nice solid response by White];B[fe];W[ge];B[gf]
(;W[hf]SQ[mc][nc][nd]C[I think an approach move near the upper right corner is a better
idea.  Any of the points marked with squares would be reasonable.
Black would probably play to defend the corner and White could
build another wall facing the current one.  See the variation]
;B[gg];W[qf]SQ[nc]C[trustme: Probably I should play something like L16 now...    L 16 is a bit too close to White's wall.  M16 is a good choice
just based on the size of the wall.  An even better idea, IMO,
is to approach the corner.  O17 is the correct side to approach
the corner.  That would use the strength of White's wall to better
advantage.];B[id]C[This is rather close to White's wall.  White should be able to
gain a lot while attacking this stone.];W[kd]SQ[jd][ie]C[This is a good start for White's attack.  A contact play at either
of the squares is a bad idea here.  Contact fights tend to strengthen
both sides.  Here, Black is weak while White is strong.  So,
a contact fight will make Black strong without White gaining
a lot.];B[he];W[if];B[jc]
(;W[kc]TR[ib]SQ[fc][gc][gd][ge]C[The White group marked with squares is in danger of being surrounded.
Playing at the triangle will still press Black and will also
give White more room for eyes.  See the variation.];B[kb]C[trustme: now shape of black group looks very strange for me,
how should I manage it?   J18 is still a good way to attack this shape.  White can force
Black to actually connect these stones.  By choosing which way
to force the connections, White will be able to profit from this.
See variation starting next move.]
(;W[lb]TR[ib]C[trustme: suppose, bad move, helping black   The move at the triangle is still a better choice.  White probably
can't kill Black.  Instead, focus on gaining something as the
Black group is attacked.];B[ib]SQ[ge][gd][gc][fc]C[This move seals the fate of the marked stones.  White should
stop trying to save them.  Instead, try to think of ways to make
a profit while forcing Black to finish killing the stones]
(;W[hb]TR[ie]SQ[fc][gc][gd][ge]C[Focus on walling in Black from the outside while Black spends
some moves making sure the White stones are dead.  See the variation.]
;B[fb];W[hd]C[This doesn't help White live.  Give up on stones that will be
hard or impossible to save and move on.];B[ie];W[je];B[gb];W[qc]
TR[jd]C[trustme: my F16 group is dead and I decided to play elsewhere.

Playing at the triangle forces White to finish off the dead stones
and allows White to strengthen the wall in Sente.  Then White
can play elsewhere.];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb]
(;W[pe]TR[ob]C[White should use the wall and attack low to steal eye space.
Normally, a White play at the triangle would risk being cut off
and captured against the side.  Here, however, White can retreat
back to the wall for safety.  See the variation.];B[mc];W[lc]

group.  Black may not die, but White should profit.  See variation.]

[lb]C[The marked White stones are now cut off.  White should now consider
them "probably dead" and think about ways to use their death.
For example, playing at the triangle allows White to strengthen
the wall in Sente];W[pj]TR[pm]C[White should play further from the wall to make the most from
it.  White could play as far out as the triangle.];B[ig]TR[nq]
[qn][hq]SQ[er][cm]C[trustme: blindness...    There are a lot moves worth more than these two stones.  This
is an endgame move by Black.  Black would gain a lot more by
invading at one of the triangles or defending at one of the squares.
Always take a moment look over the whole board.  Play moves that
are worth the most.  Don't bother capturing two stones until
late in the endgame (unless capturing them also serves some larger
purpose).];W[ih]TR[qm][mq][jn]SQ[cm][cq]C[This is a small move for White.  White would be better served
by invading at one of the squares or defending at one of the
triangles.];B[hg];W[jj]TR[jn]C[trustme: going to build large moyo   I like the triangle better.  Work out from the sides when building
a moyo.  Don't work in from the center because the center is
harder to defend.   Also, White's sides are still rather open
to invasion and this doesn't help defend them.  Playing at the
triangle makes it harder for Black to invade around N3];B[hj]

(;W[ck]C[trustme: I was to invade and didn't find better point.    I think C7 and C3 are better choices.  I showed the 3x3 invasion
here in an earlier variation.  See the current variation for
an invasion at C7];B[cj]C[This is a nice solid response by Black.]

things complicated is often a reasonable strategy for a stronger
player giving a handicap.  See the variation.];B[hn];W[jn];B[gp]
