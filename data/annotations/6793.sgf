C[PM:  Thanks for this review!  I've heard it's unusual to submit a game that you've won, but this was a rare game that I feel like everything clicked, so I want to also find out what I'm missing.  Also, I'm interested to know some things my opponent should have done better.  I took Black and won by 17.5 points.  I feel like i've been synthesizing a lot of the great advice i've gotten on the GTL, wondering where to go from here.  Thanks again!

Hello, my name is Thomas FARRAY, and I live in France.  I'm about 3 or 2 k on KGS, and I wil try to review your game, on my best.
This game is a moyo making game ... I'm not best at those, and I often get confused when I play one because I hate counting.  My global feeling is that there was no fight in this game.  Black is right not to fight, since he is always ahead ! White played a boring game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[ci]TR[nc]C[Zam : Not usual ... and slow.  White muse reduce black's inflence ... a good spot is the triangle.]
;B[jp];W[jc]TR[nc]C[Zam : I would still play closer];B[cn]C[Zam : Black is looking for trouble ... but this is playable]
;W[fp]C[PM:  I would have preferred F3 here, I was pretty sure I could shut white into that corner .

Zam : with this move, black can still attack/get  the corner.  ... It is usual response and works well with C11]
;B[bp];W[cq]TR[eq]C[PM:  Right direction for both of us?  I was betting that white would answer in the corner giving me the opprotunity to follow up with a 2-space extension.

Zam : this is a safe way to play! Since white just "copied"  your opening moves, you are not behind.  This move makes the corner white ... but this shape has a weakness.]
;B[ck];W[ei]C[PM:  Running to the center odd here?

Zam : Making a moyo ... and if you try to invade, he can take advantage of the weak group ... so this is not a bad move.]
;B[hq]C[PM:  Would C15 have been bigger?  I wanted to strengthen what I thought was the weakest stone on the board.

Zam : This move is not bad since it defends and attacks.  White defends, so this is good.]
;W[bq];B[mq]C[Zam : This feels slow, but black is ahead ... and this is pushing white to will to get into black's game

Since White played B4, the black shape is not as strong as before.  If I were white, I would have taken advantage of it to make white stronger (see var)]

(;W[fr]C[Zam : This is  not a good move at all.  It threatends noting, is covers nothing.  See var

White should try between :
- making a bigger moyo
- reducing black while building something]
(;B[pg];W[nc];B[ne]C[PM:  Seeing white's three stones on the third line along the top, I figured I would use this as an opprotunity to keep white confined while building a huge center moyo, I figure attacks on white's southwest group would keep me ahead of the land grab from that end.

Zam : I do not really like this move since it is purely territorrial.  But you are still ahead ... Don't forget that the center is not black yet ... and that you just gave white a corner]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[pn];W[ee]C[Zam : This does not secures white territory]
;B[md];W[mc];B[ke]TR[kd]C[PM:  I had actually planned this out, is there a better way to keep white limited to the top?

Zam : This feels good to fulfill yours plans of keeping white at the top.  But this is gote.  I would have played at the triangle.  
White has to reduce now black !];W[je]C[Zam : threatens noting.  Purely territorial.  Slow !!!]
;B[kd]TR[kf]C[Zam : running into white's strengh is not good]

(;W[jd]TR[ib]C[Zam : White should have played J18];B[kc];W[kb]
;B[lb]C[PM:  I'm not sure why I played this move, I think this was a case of "Sente for Sente's sake", I figured white would need two moves to deal with this stone, on the west and the east.]
;W[jb]
(;B[jf]C[PM:  "Hane at the head of two stones" must apply here too, I figured.

Zam : Hane at three is good.  Hane here is maybe not the best.  Why not end what you started ? it is big AND sente !  Se var]

(;W[if]C[Zam : white could cut];B[jg];W[ig];B[jk]C[PM:  This was a move inspired by looking at a kifu of "the ear reddening game", I forget who played.

Zam : White is so small !  Black si so strong.  White has to invade strongly ....]
;W[hj]C[Zam : white HAS to get into black's moyo.  Do not defend when you are behind !]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[rc];B[rd];W[sb]C[Zam : gote ... only few points.]
;B[ho];W[bj]C[Zam : Bigger than H5];B[bk];W[lc]C[Zam : Finally !]
;B[ld];W[gp]C[Zam : Gote.];B[hp]
(;W[cp]C[Zam : Better Get a stone];B[bo];W[gq]C[Zam : small]
;B[hl];W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[em];W[dk]

;W[gm]C[Zam : No territory to gain here. ..];B[hm];W[gl];B[qi]
C[PM:  Unnessisary?

Zam : yes, but if you fear invasion, but since you are  ahead, you can play it.]

C[PM:  I "felt" like I was ahead in this game, so I spent a few moves giving up sente to fix up what I thought were defects in my shape, I was suprised by what a relatively small margin I won by, I've had a difficult time learning how to estimate territory so I've been going on feel, which is probably why I'm stuck at 9k!  Any help you could give me would be appreciated.  Also, I think white could have killed my western group somehow but I'm not sure how.   Thanks again!

Zam : I'm still not goot at counting ... and sometimes I get a bad estimation.  I often play blitz games, so I always see and estimate a game.  One good way to do that si to get away from the board, and try to see it from far .  This often gives an appropriate estimation.

In the opening, don't get into the other strengh.  Try to build fast.

To get better, you have to fight, fight, and fight again.  This will make you loose some games, but it will make you learn what to do, and what not to do.  In the end game, try to gain points in the corner first, on the sides second, and then in the center.  You lost some important points.

Last advise, when you tenuki, you must always think about doing 2 things at 1 time.  If your next stone does only one thing (expanding your moyo) then it is not a good play.  Do something else (unless you are far ahead in score)]
