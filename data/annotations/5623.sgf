C[mvo [8k\]: hi, gg
Diirk [7k\]: hello
Diirk [7k\]: enjoy the game
Diirk [7k\]: Could you review this game for me?
Diirk [7k\]: I play white, I know I made a few mistakes, but I think that this game is quite representative of my current style. Could you give me some general advise on where to imrove?]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[cj]C[Diirk [7k\]: improve*
Diirk [7k\]: maybe I could have played near K16 here to prevent black double-wing, but I think E3 is just as good]

(;W[eq]C[E3 looks slow here, because of black c10];B[jd];W[qf]
;B[nd];W[pj]C[Black o16 helps white a bit. I'd play r12 as black]
;B[cm]C[Again, back is slow here. k3 is my move here.]
(;W[fd]C[this invasion seems to be too early. I'd play k4 first. It is a big move. In the upper left corner there are many approaches and it is not clear, which is the best to use.]
;B[dc]
(;W[fc]C[white is heavy]
(;B[ee];W[ic]C[good idea];B[jc]
(;W[he]C[Diirk [7k\]: this is a mistake; J16 maybe? but J16 is ugly shape...]
;B[id]C[not a good move by black, he helps to white to develope his shape]

(;W[hc];B[hd];W[ge];B[gd];W[fe];B[gc];W[gb]
(;B[fb]C[This move helps to white.];W[eb];B[hb];W[fa];B[ib]
;W[cb]C[a good move];B[db];W[da];B[cc];W[bb]C[Diirk [7k\]: I get a small corner, black gets very strong thickness.
Diirk [7k\]: so, I manage to split the black formation in half, in return of strengthening black, and getting a weak group myself
Diirk [7k\]: can you show me, how I could have done a better invasion?

White is ok with this result. Your group is almost alive and black has a weak group on the upper left. His area was considerably damaged. but black has not played very good.]
;B[bc]
(;W[rd]C[k4 is bigger];B[qc];W[ef]C[this helps to black];B[df]
;W[eg];B[dg]
(;W[kq];B[eh]C[Diirk [7k\]: sorry! power problems
mvo [8k\]: ok
Diirk [7k\]: using washing machine+hair dryer in 1 house was too much :D

black is surely happy to have this move available, although it is not the time to play it.]
;W[pq]
(;B[ab]C[Diirk [7k\]: too small move for B

this is an endgame move, although removes one possibility for eye for the white group]

(;W[em]C[Diirk [7k\]: I think E7 is big, otherwise B could have made big influence by pressing my F15 group]

(;B[do]C[black should have first attacked the upper white group as shown earlier.

this move looks odd to me, it makes white stronger];W[eo];B[dp]
;W[ep]C[Diirk [7k\]: B D3 gives a complicated result, maybe black should have played it
Diirk [7k\]: so, maybe E7 would have been safer at E6 or something]

(;B[dn]C[this looks ok with me];W[dq];B[en];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm]
;B[fl]
(;W[hn];B[ko]C[This looks too deep to whites area. White has to attack.]

(;W[lo]C[Diirk [7k\]: trying to 'push the enemy towards thickness' here

Bad. Attaching to a weak stone always helps to the weak stone.]

you play dame points here.];B[gq];W[lm];B[jp]C[Diirk [7k\]: J3 should have been K3 or something]

(;W[co]C[there is a better move];B[cn];W[ek];B[ej];W[lj];B[ki]
C[Diirk [7k\]: black is preventing a connection that is nor really important, because my F15 group is alive
Diirk [7k\]: not*

F15 looks ok.];W[li];B[kh];W[rc];B[ih];W[ig];B[jh];W[ec]C[Diirk [7k\]: I think I have to sacrifice these stones to stay alive...

that's no problem];B[hh];W[fg];B[hf];W[gf];B[jg]
(;W[gg]C[Diirk [7k\]: G13 mistake? I think it looked big at first sight, but is actually very small... (yes, see var)

this is 1 point move, there are much bigger moves around such as o13, r18, b5 etc.]

;B[ol];W[pl];B[tt]C[Diirk [7k\]: I think my opening was OK... then my invasion on the upper side turned out quite good for black, while blacks invasion in my lower side was quite harmful for me. Then, I still won the middle game, because black refused to do anything about my growing moyo/territory on the right
Diirk [7k\]: do you agree? where can I improve?
Diirk [7k\]: Thanks a lot for your review! :-)

Good luck to your future games! I hope my review will help you.]
