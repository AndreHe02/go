KM[0.5];W[fq];B[eq]L[jp][dn][fp][jd]C[B e3 is good only when there is already a black stone around 'a'. It is an attacking

move, it does not defend the corner which is still open at c3. B should simply play
'b'. B 'c' or 'd' are also playable, this is a question of personal style.]

B n3 is not as large as it looks since the corner is still open at 'c' or 'd'.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[qk];B[on]L[qi][jd]C[B p6 is not good in this context. It would be playable if B had already blocked white's
escape with a stone at 'a'. I would still play B 'b' here.];W[qf];B[qh]
L[jd][nd][qk]C[This move is usually played when there is already a B stone at 'a'. The idea is

to give up the corner in exchange for a nice wall facing 'a'. However B r12 here
seems playable if B is in an agressive mood.];W[qc];B[oh]L[ok][of]

But B 'c' seems also possible.];W[qd];B[dj]L[ok]C[B should definitely play at 'a'. W will live inside but B will make a nice

outside thickness. Also W will end in gote so B will have time to play d10 anyway.]
;W[cf]L[ok]M[fp][fq][jp]C[obh: now I want to build a thick wall facing center

jloup: you missed an opportunity to do this at the previous move (at 'a'). This
   would have indirectly weakened the marked stones.];B[df];W[ce]L[dg]
C[The joseki is W 'a'.];B[de];W[cd];B[dg]L[jd][cc]C[B d13 is thick, but there is a risk that the thickness goes to waste if W gets to

play 'a' first. So in such a situation make sure that your move is sente.  Here, if

white ignores B d13, B 'b' would be very painful for white, so B d13 seems ok.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[cc]
(;B[gd]L[ok][jd][of][ed]C[B g16 is too close to the black thickness. "Don't play close to thickness" says the

proverb. B should not be afraid of the cut at 'd' since the cutting stone would be caught

in geta. B should still play 'a' to take the initiative; W will probably live in gote

and make B thicker outside, then B will be able to take 'b' or 'c'. See variation B for
a possible result after B 'b'.];W[pc];B[lc]M[gd]L[jd]C[Here you see that the marked stone would be better at 'a'.]

;W[pn];B[om]L[rn]M[jp][fp][fq]C[B could have tried 'a' instead, but this would have started a difficult fight,

which is not recommended in a 4 stones handicap game. B p7 also makes thickness
which could become useful to attack the marked stones later.];W[rn];B[ro]
;W[sm];B[nj];W[pj]C[B gets an excellent result.];B[nf]L[me]C[obh: I though that my p12 group needed more lifespace.
jloup: I would prefer B 'a'. The p12 group is not in danger at this moment.]
;W[le];B[lf]L[jd][me][jn]C[obh: I can't really explain this move. I guess l16 would be much better.

jloup: B m14 is not that bad because it prepares a big center if B can get 'c'.

    To defend the upper side, the proper move in answer to a cap (m15) is most
    of the time a knight's move ('a' here). In this context B could also
    try a more agressive line with 'b' followed by a cut.];W[ld];B[jc]L[jn]C[B k17 is good but B could also consider 'a'.];W[je];B[oe]L[me]
[jn][cg]C[B p15 is much too small at this stage of the game, since it is gote (B cannot
cut the W group). B could first force at 'a' (W must reply) then play 'b'.
B 'c' is also very big.];W[od]C[W is too kind to answer.];B[kq]L[jn]
[jg]C[obh: I think I built my wall for this reason. to press this group...
jloup: the idea of attacking is good, but here pressing from below is not good
   since W would be delighted to run into the center to destroy any potential
   B center territory. I would press from above with 'a'. If W answers at the
   bottom, B is then happy to take 'b' to form a large moyo.];W[cl];B[cg]
L[dl][hp][jn][me][jg][el]C[obh: one of my earlier intentions was to get a big moyo. I guess this move was
    consistent with that, though k15 made that silly.

jloup: B c13 was very big before, but now it is less effective; there
isn't much territory to be made now on the left side. If W answers by jumping
at 'f', then c13 does not achieve much and the potential B territory in
the center is quite reduced.

If you want to keep your center moyo strategy, play 'a' instead and let W live
in gote as you did for the right side. Then attack at 'b' to punish W for not
answering L3.  Or instead of 'b' play 'c' followed by 'd' and 'e'.];W[co]

jloup: in answer to B g7, W would certainly not play h7. W would simply discard these

   two stones and escape towards the top. B must not assume that W will play badly.

;B[fg];W[eg];B[ir];W[jr];B[gr];W[hp];C[obj: I resigned. Could not see any way to save my dragon.

jloup: Good decision.


What can we learn from this game? B has kept for a long time his 4 stones advantage

by playing thick (except in the lower left, where B played too thinly). This is good,

keep this style. However, the thickness must be put to use at some point, either by

attacking or by making territory. B had a magnificent moyo in the center which B let

go to waste. In several occasions B played a small local move instead of looking at

the global picture. B n4 was the worst of such moves. So the main lesson of this game

could be "think globally, don't get yourself always tied to local fights, keep looking
for the big points".


W made a good game considering the difficulty of giving a 4 stones handicap, and
played very well in the end. Congratulations!])
