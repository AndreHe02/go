C[Hello, I'm 1D+ igs. I lost this reverse-komi game by 3.5 and
I want to know why. I can't find where's my big mistakes but
I know I must have made them.
Thanks a lot for reviewing this boring-style game. :)

I'm 3D+ on IGS, so I don't really feel qualified to comment on this game - but I tried my best. I find the opening play quite strange, with little feeling for the whole board - other than that I've only pointed out small inaccuracies in the play of both sides. I'm hope this will be of some use to you, but you have to take it with a pinch of salt as I'm not that much stronger than you.]

(;W[qo]C[the low approach is not really consistent with the K4 high stone - you're making M3 a doubly good move for B since it will now both be an extension and a block]
;B[pl]LB[no:D][mp:B][np:C][mq:A]C[after the B pincer, W should definitely move out -- give up the R5 stone if you have to...]
;W[pn];B[np];W[rq];B[lq]C[this looks like an ideal shape for black because he can play the M3 vital point in a natural way]
;W[jq]C[Too slow? I want to attack black.

That black formation is quite strong, and you have some problems to make territory with your attack because of the aji in F3. I think you are falling behind in the opening.]
;B[dn];W[fp]C[this exchange feels like aji-keshi to me...if B was going to continue by extending up the left side I could understand it, but in the game it makes no sense]
;B[qh];W[qj]C[I want my right side group to be 100% alive before attacking.

I think you're putting too much faith in your attack -- realistically how many points can you earn by attacking the bottom group?]
;B[pj];W[qk];B[pk];W[ql];B[qi];W[pm];B[fc];W[nr]C[now you have invested three moves to attack three stones - even if they were dead now you would not have gained much, and they are very far from dead.]

;B[nn];W[nm]
(;B[on]C[this move I cannot believe! it does almost nothing for black, but it removes all the aji of the cut (which works)]
;W[om];B[mr]C[now W should be leading -- living in gote like this is very poor, and it's not even 100% alive]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[bi];B[bj]
(;W[pp]C[I wonder if this move should be around N12 or not? I think it
will be too close to thickness so I decided to play endgame.

if it's too close to thickness, hold back a bit -- but the urgent point is definitly in the middle.]

not too much -- E9 and D10 were clearly kikashi stones, you can give them away.]
