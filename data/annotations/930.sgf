C[I don't see 21 points worth of mistakes on my part. Why did I loose by that much?

Hi mgm,
My name is Ashish and I'll do my best to review this game.  My ID on IGS is Ashwolf (15k*) and my email address is ashhome@hotmail.com
I'm not infallible, and may not have explained everything clearly... so feel free to get in touch with me if you have any further queries.
My comments mostly refer to black though I do remark on white's moves at some points.

To answer your question: I think black 138-140 right away cost more than 21 points.  However, you overall played a very good game and have a good sense of thickness and position.  Remember that it is fairly hard to make points in the centre, so the same number of moves might be better invested gaining territory/strength along the edges, and _then_ using that strength to make profit.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[nq];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[qj]LB[pj:A]C[Ashwolf:Since the q4 stones are strong you could also play this one line higher, at a.
But r10 is fine too.];W[qf]
(;B[nd]LB[qe:A]C[Ashwolf:Hmm... since you already have white squeezed, how about first attacking at a?
You can attack the weak stone while gaining strength along upper side.]
;W[rd];B[of]LB[pg:A][qg:B]C[Ashwolf:This is an inefficient move.  What are you trying to accomplish here?
You do not enclose territory, and do not effectively attack the white group.
Also, center influence is not immediately useful since the potential black moyo is open along the top and the bottom.
Try extending along the top line first, then attacking with a 'shoulder hit' at a.

Globally, there are lots of big points on the board; the left side is wide open.]

[di]C[Ashwolf:Interesting.  The pincer at c8 normally works well combined with a black stone near k4.  However, that is not the case here, and moves at a or b, followed by any of the triangle moves, all look interesting for white.  Hard to say who gets the upper hand.]
;W[cq]C[Ashwolf:White gives black a lot of outside influence, in exchange for territory along lower side.]

;B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[cg]C[Ashwolf:Good.];W[gc];B[qc]MA[jc]
[kd][kc]C[Too small, I think. Maybe one of the marked positions?

Ashwolf:Yes, definitely.  By playing there your central influence starts to look big.  Now imagine white getting there first -- your right side stones look like a dangling line, and it's difficult to make points in the centre.]
;W[rc];B[ef]TR[cg][cl]C[Ashwolf: too lose, because of the gap between the two marked stones.]

(;B[ek];W[bn];B[ap]LB[ao:A]C[Ashwolf: Simply descending to a5 is better in such situations.  Your group gains one more liberty, and white gets fewer sente moves.]

In the endgame, it becomes easy to calculate the value of moves, and to predict which ones result in sente or gote for you.  Always attempt to play big moves which retain sente (so you can follow them with other big moves)  :)]
