[dc];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq]C[this seems ok,  but if w f4 possible? or others?
My opinion : d3 is joseki, so no problem :*) Anyway I think f4 is bad  because cross-cut would be too good for black]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[jp];W[ce]C[are  there bigger points? too passive?
My opinion : C15 is much too slow; Q10 (or R10) is really big (san ren sei  + lower side)
You can't afford to build your second shimari in C15];B[pj];W[qc]C[would be  better on the outside, I think. eg. O17, O16 or N17.
My opinion : I think O17 would be the best move; it would prevent black from  having too much influence in the center. Moreover, it works well with D16  shimari.
You may play san-san only when kakari is impossible];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W
[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[dj]C[My opinion : I would have  rather played K16 which is the first extension of this shimari. Though, as  you are behind in territory and thickness, R6 might have been good.]

C[better at  o9 or p10 or other? p7 definitely bad, it seems
My opinion : O9 would have been maybe better but I don't think P7 is bad]
;B[nk];W[oo]C[My opinion : I would have rather N6; not all kikashi are good  to be played  : after P4, you can't play R3, P3 anymore]
;B[op];W[no];B[rn];W[ro];B[rp];W[rm];B[so];W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[id];W[hc]
C[My opinion : I would  have rather H15];B[ic];W[hd];B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W
[hf];B[ie];W[ff]C[My opinion  : wrong direction after cross-cut; should have been G13 : this way you could  enter black's moyo]
;B[gg]C[My opinion : black's moyo turns into territory];W[fe];B[gi];W[fh]
;B[gh];W[fg]C[My opinion : too slow; F6 could be good,  making moyo and entering black's one]
;B[dl];W[fj]C[better at f9?
My opinion : definitely :*)];B[fl];W[fn];B[co];W[do];B[dp];W[cq];B[cn];W
[cm];B[bm];W[cl];B[dm];W[bn];B[bo];W[bp];B[an];W[ao]C[My opinion : B8 would have  been much better]
;B[ap];W[aq];B[ck];W[cj];B[bl];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[hm];W[ij]
C[My opinion : should have been J9 then cross-cut and fight,  threatening to link with N6 group]
;B[ii];W[hi];B[ih];W[hh];B[hg];W[hj];B[jk];W[fi]C[My opinion : too slow, rather M5, or make your LL group alive]
;B[br];W[fr];B[gr];W[es];B[bq];W[ao];B[bj];W[bi];B[ap];W[gj]C[better played at j13
My opinion : j13 doesn't seem to work];B[ig];W[ao];B[ai];W[bh];B[ap];W[qi]
;B[rh];W[ao]C[is the ko worth it at this point? I was figuring I need it for  the corner to live.
My opinion : you were right, this ko is really worth playing];B[mo];W[ap]
;B[nn];W[ql]C[i could still make 2 eyes palying at p6, I think];B[on];W
[po];B[pm];W[qm];B[nm];W[pl];B[gs];W[mb]C[My opinion : really risky, LL group  isn't alive yet]
