C[Hello, my name is Patrick
Thank you for reviewing this game

I played white as kenson[10k\] on KGS

Although white was eventually ahead, I felt very uncomfortable up to move 143, when I succeeded with saving a weak group.

My main concerns are about the way the situation became so. I think important moves were missed along the fuseki.]
;B[dd];W[qd];B[pp]C[> Here you know this is going to be a fighting game, there will be no big moyos]
;W[dq];B[dn]
(;W[co]LB[gp:A]SQ[cj][dj][ck][dk][cl][dl]C[I poor with Josekis, but I don't think D6 is.

Anyway I was destabilized by this move
thought a moment to play at A

pincer or invade around marked points?
even now I'm not sure of what to respond here


>  I think c5 will work.  Normally b would play this move at c6, in which case w normally responds at c4.  c4 may be correct here too, but I couldnt' tell you why.  Pincering would be a mistake.  Remember "corners, side, center"  in that order.  You have a chance to take a big corner with c4 or c5.  If you pincer, you give up the corner for the side.]
;B[cn]C[> This is the problem with c5, you shoulder hit his stone and he must respond.... if w were to play at c4, the corner is seccure, and b does not have such an obvious move then.]
;W[ck]CR[dj]LB[cf:B][ci:A][cl:C]C[I think this was bad, due to the wall, but I didn't want to let my opponent get all the left side by playing at D10

A (then B or C) better?

>  hmm, agressive, but ok I think.  Normally you would take your extention along the bottom and let b have his, then it's w's turn.

> your thinking is wrong though, "I didn't want to let my opponent get".... this is greedy thinking, Go is about trades and ballance.  You have to let him have something :)

>  but this is, like I said, bound to be an agressive game.  Now it will be for sure.  Still, I think this is asking for trouble.

>  If you are going to do this, it would be better at A.  That way you would have a little wiggle room to extend when he pincers you from the top, and you still take away his ideal extension.]
;B[cg]C[> ah, b mistake.... he should come down to C11 and attack your stone.]
;W[dh];B[bo];W[bp]C[> this is good for w.... b is playing on the seccond line, but w's response seccures territory on the fourth line.]
;B[do];W[cp];B[ao]C[>terrible for b];W[ap]C[>  !!! don't respond to your opponents bad moves.... first line moves are YOSE!  (Endgame).  Think about where else you could have played this move!]
;B[bm];W[ch];B[dg];W[eg]C[> hane at the head of 2 stones, good]
;B[df]C[> I think even 10k knows not to do this ... right?   Empty triangles are bad.]
;W[jd]C[was it ok to tenuki here?
left group is still weak for important points are still open

>  group on left is not too weak, you will have to run because b7 is looking under and it will be easy for b to strip out your base, but running is easy from here.  Tenuki is correct.]
;B[bk];W[bj]C[> this should be worth one eye... you will still need to move out, but this group is fine]
;B[ak];W[aj]C[>  DON"T DO THIS... first line moves are for the endgame.  If your opponent (10k) does it, you don't have to do it too.  If he jumps off a bridge, will you do that too?  Use his mistake to get a free move.  He may as well pass as play A9.]
;B[cl];W[bg];B[bf]C[> B13 is too slow, there are huge points on the board, don't play 2nd line moves]
;W[ah];B[dk];W[ef];B[ee];W[cc]C[in terms of territory, did it worth to play here? (the idea was to threaten the black group while getting the corner)
if no, what was the best move here?

does a threating move like C15 have a sense? (if it doesn't work, the corner is lost, no?)

> C15 is a vital point for sure, but B will just take the corner and live anyway if you played c15.   This is a good attack and invasion, but not the most urgent place on the board.  I would be most concerned with the bottom side.  Imagine a b stone at f4, or thereabouts.  It is urgent that w extends from the group in the bottom left.]
;B[dc]C[>  also, this could easily be gote for w];W[cd];B[ce]
C[>  b is alive now];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc];W[bd];B[af];W[be]
C[> this does nothing, better to put it somewhere else];B[mq]
;W[iq];B[md]
(;W[gd];B[gc]C[>  this sucks... b should play p17, it is the biggest point for both w and b]
;W[hc];B[fe];W[fd]C[this was poor

> yeah];B[ec]C[> heh, he responded though];W[ge];B[ff];W[eh]
;B[gg];W[oc]C[I lost moves with F16 and G15
Now C12 is even weaker and may be it's not time to tenuki again

> Yes, I see the difficulty here.  This move is HUGE, and w wants it so bad, but should have played it so long ago instead of wasting moves like f16.  But here, the e12 group is in trouble... and w cannot let them die.  I would worry that b can kill them now, or at least put up a strong attack.  Also, instead of those first and seccond line moves earlier, it would have been so much better to just make a simple one point jump into the middle, and now you wouldn't have to worry about getting sealed in and killed.]
(;B[hb];W[ib]C[>hmm, this is a double hane, you have to read it out fully before you do it, I don't think it works here with the cut.  Also, this is an example of one of those knee-jerk reactions where you play the seccond line just because he did.... how about instead of j18 you play m17?  then o15, then r10?  something like that]
;B[ic];W[hd]C[>yuck, why?  this shape is terrible, you will get nothing by saving these stones, ... it's better to just let them die and tenuki.]
;B[jb];W[jc];B[ia];W[id];B[ib];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[pj]C[obviously this was a move both of us should have played earlier

> mega huge move];W[ld]C[> this is bad, slow, heavy, think bigger and faster and looser]
;B[me];W[pg];B[lf];W[qn]C[this move was essential due to the way the game turned on

> I worry that q10 is already blocking w's extension.  maybe a corner invasion would be better here.]
;B[mb];W[nb]C[>  this time it's a good idea];B[qo];W[pn];B[ql]
(;W[po]C[> ah!   if you're going to do this, then hane underneeth first.  I'll make a line to show ya.]

;B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[rh];B[qi];W[qk]C[this move helped me a lot,
but does it really work? (see viariation)]
(;B[nh];W[pk];B[og];W[ri];B[lh];W[lo]TR[gg][lh][nh][oi][pj]
[dk][dn][do]C[I didn't know what to play here !
the center is hard to control now, due to the black marked stones
...and C12 is still weak

G12 better?
or playing around M10?

eventually I played M5 with the purpose on both having a foot whithin the low center and trying to close the bottom area

>  the e12 group is the most important, if those die you lose.  In the begining I said there'd be no moyo because of the diagonal fuseki.  There is no potential for a moyo here, not for w or b.  Saving your e12 group is URGENT and m5 is gote.  You should waste no time securing week groups.]

later on, trying to save this weak group, I losted the main part of the territory this wall was supposed to give me :(
