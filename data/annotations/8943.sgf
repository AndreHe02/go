C[Hi, I got strongly beaten in this game, but I'm not sure where I was so wrong. Could you say me where I played badly ? Thank you.
Some questions later in the file, but not so many :)

WOG: Hi!

Thanks for submitting this game!  

There were a number of errors early on that made this game far from winnable for White early on.

General trend errors seem to be a focus on the very local versus the global.  You need to keep the whole board in mind - whether in fuseki, in the accounting for the score, or what you're trying to accomplish.

Also, when you're really far behind, please resign instead of keeping playing.  Learning how to keep track of the score is something a 3d needs to be able to do in order to become 4d :^).

Enjoy the review.];B[pp];W[pd];B[do];W[cd];B[gp]C[Kind of strange formation, do I have to thik about invading this ?

WOG: No. As you say, this is just shape. It's a loose shimari with gaps.  You don't need to think about how to exploit those gaps till later.]
;W[dj]C[WOG: My gut tells me that this is too close to the Black loose shimari.  Although it has a good next at c7, my preference would have been to finish the White shimari up top or approach the other black stone in the lower right.]
;B[fd]C[WOG: Precisely!];W[df]C[WOG: This feels a little scrunched for me. It's as if you're playing this stone without thinking about the White stone up on the side... Yes, semi well coordinated, but look at the rest of the board.  You now have three stones in 14 contiguous spots on the board.  That's fine if it's some joseki, but this is fuseki.  Just feels scrunched to me.]
;B[dc]C[WOG: I am not up on the latest joseki, but this seems rather aji keshi for Black.  Yes, it continues the theme of White being over concentrated on one side, but the corner has so much potential that shutting out that potential for resolving it so cleanly only helps pad my dislike of this move.  I'm an old fashioned fuddy-duddy when it comes to this though, so YMMV.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[eb]C[I wasn't sure about this sequence, should have I taken the sente ?

WOG: I'm not up on the latest joseki thinking, therefore, I cannot tell you anything about joseki and what's normal - please discover that on your own.  However, I can say that I would not play this way for Black.  Inviting the White atari is not settling the shape, but is mildly satisfying for sente and options in response.]
;W[ca]C[WOG: Good];B[qf]C[WOG: Review up to here is as I've said before.  White seems all about the left top.  Black has played in all four corners of the board.  I think Black's fuseki is better, despite my dislike of the top left joseki? (is it joseki?)]
;W[mc]
(;B[qc]C[In tis corner, things went very wrong for me, I don't really get which move (or idea) was bad.

WOG: Interesting play by Black.  Not sure I'd go this way.  I can take the side with Q10 instead?]

(;W[re]C[WOG: One option];B[rc];W[qe];B[rf]C[WOG: Is this a trick?]
;W[se];B[ob]
(;W[oc]C[WOG: Do you need to connect this way?  This way is so direct.  Even o16 is not as direct and minor.  

Point is, you're inducing Black to play a move that helps resolves Black's shape.  Of course, Black will extend to o18; Black must. By why compel Black to help Black's shape?]
;B[nb]C[WOG: of course, this is a good result for Black.]
(;W[nc]C[WOG: This seems strong, but a bit over concentrated.]
;B[of]C[WOG: Black gets both here];W[mb]C[WOG: This is huge, but is more or less a ko threat taken too early.  Would Black have played here if you played away?  Probably not.]
;B[pc]C[WOG: You more or less forced Black to raise this weakness in your shape.]
;W[na]C[WOG: Whoa!  Is there a ko going on that I'm not seeing?  Do you know there's aji for killing the corner that you're missing? This move erases aji - a bad thing.]
;B[pa];W[pg]C[WOG: Don't peep and make Black strong!!!];B[pf]
;W[ld]C[WOG: Oh my!  In gote?!];B[ne]C[WOG: Just adding insult to injury?]
;W[od];B[lf]C[Seems like white gets nothing ...

WOG: Right. See earlier comments.]
(;W[id]C[WOG: Too close to the White wall.  Take Black's base on the side?]
;B[ic]C[WOG: Is this being treated as a handicap game?  This is too much for Black to do.]
;W[hc]C[Too offensive maybe ...

WOG: If you can't play here, you should resign.];B[jd]C[WOG: WHAT A BULLY!]
(;W[jc]C[WOG: Oh my!  You need to double hane instead. This move is death on a stick]
;B[ib]
(;W[jb]C[WOG: This way is lost.  Better to take the lone stone.]
;B[hb];W[je];B[hd];W[kd];B[he];W[jg]C[WOG: Oh my goodness.  This game is lost so early.  Black is happy on all sides and the one big eye White group runs through the middle.  Black should be most happy.]
(;B[qn]C[WOG: A bit far from the Black wall IMHO.];W[pk]C[WOG: QED. Not that this is the right time to be attacking a wall (what's the sense in that anyway), but it demonstrates the problem with Black.]
;B[nk]C[WOG: Also true, that this IS a wall and not a line of weak stones.]
;W[nj]C[WOG: Does this work?];B[oj]C[WOG: Black doesn't think so]
;W[ok]C[This probably didn't work, but I wanted to attack black's upper group, which is quite rootless

WOG: A rootless wall is still a wall.];B[oi]C[WOG: Wall-like]
;W[mj]C[WOG: You two are having a difference of opinions about the weakness and the strength of Black's stones.]
;B[mk]C[WOG: Wow, Black really disagrees!];W[nh];B[ph];W[oh]
C[WOG: You're pushing too hard.];B[qi];W[qg]C[WOG: You can only play here if it works... it doesn't.]

C[WOG: You can't save both...];B[ni];W[mi];B[mh]C[WOG: Game over?]
;W[qj];B[ng]C[WOG: Game over?];W[rj]C[Hehe poor sequence ...]
;B[ri];W[kj];B[lk];W[ki];B[om]C[WOG: Gargantuan. You know, I've always liked that word, "gargantuan" … I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence... this massive coronary by White can barely be resuscitated.]
;W[cm]C[WOG: Uh?  What?  Please keep track of the score when playing Go.  White is MASSIVELY behind.]
;B[bo]C[WOG: White should resign.];W[cp]C[I got the corner, but not sure it was supposed to happen

WOG: Yes, corner should be tiny if at all; but, White should have resigned.]
;B[co];W[eq];B[fq];W[ep];B[fn];W[eo];B[en];W[fr];B[gr];W[dr]
;B[dm]C[WOG: Equal result for Black.  You get the corner, Black eats into White's and protects the right side.]
;W[bq];B[dh];W[eh]C[Here I thought influence was not tha important, but maybe I'm already late ...

WOG: Any eating by Black is good here.  Black's far ahead.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[ei];W[di];B[fh];W[ch];B[jl]C[Big lower side, I try to invade but didn't succeed well

WOG: Black reduced the White side and got to play here in sente... not good.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[op]C[Is this playable ?

WOG: This move is good for finding a place to resign or at least try to find something... hope for an opponent misplay.]
