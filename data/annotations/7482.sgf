C[Hello. Thank you for reviewing this game for me. This game is a game that lasted several hours, in which I played both sides myself. I am aware that this can lead to not recognizing patterns, but I did my best.

My main reason for playing as such was to slow down and spend several minutes on every move. To think about things as much as possible. I have detailed questions inside the sgf file, I played both black and white. Thank you for reviewing me.

Hi, I will start my comments with *

For my final comments see then end of the game.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[mc];B[fq];W[cl]C[White started playing more loosely than black, who played more solidly, I feel.

What I want to know is, is the loose style of white in the following moves advantageous? Or does it put white in a bad position?

* I think white plays a bit too loose. Problem of moves 6 and 8 are that they are not really forcing for black. So you are giving the initiative to black.]

(;B[oc]LB[qj:a]C[* I do not like this move because it is solely based on territory. Playing this move at A gives a lot of influence.]
;W[id];B[kc]LB[qg:a][pk:b]C[* Too soon to invade. Better at A this will seal off the corner (at least 18 points).
You can even extend your territory furthter by a move at B. 

Invading now gives white to possiility to invade on the left-side now.]
;W[ib]C[I figured black would not be able to jump out to L15 right away, because of the threat of White moving at L18 and linking up.

If this is true, then does K17 negate that, like I thought it did, or is there a tesujii for white to play?

* 12 is a good move, it seals of the left side and puts the pressure on 11.]
;B[jc];W[md]LB[ic:a][ce:b][ke:c]C[Here, my best guess at a tesujii was to separate L17 from the corner and attack it on a large scale. The way the variation played out, black did minimal damage, and died. But in this position is there a way for black to do more damage and live? I might have missed it.

* 14 does prevent black to connect but it makes the 2 white stones heavy. After black C the 2 white stones are in trouble.

After 13 you must play A. When somebody plays a peep, 99 out of 100 times simply connecting is the best move. Also in this case connecting at A is best. The white wall and move 4 are at the perfect distance of eachother. Whites terriroty at the left top side is at least 20 points.]
;B[ic]TR[mc][md]LB[ke:a][hc:b][gc:c]C[* Better at A this will but pressure on the marked white stones.

Play this move when you need to settle yourself. playing now prevents a peep B or C at a later stage.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gb]
(;B[ie];W[gd];B[he]C[Is H15 correct? Or should black move elsewhere?

* I think so with this move black has one eye and is alive.]
;W[mf]LB[jd:a][ke:b][kf:c]C[This attacks, and breaks the ladder, so I'm pretty sure that black would either have to capture, or play at K15. I chose K15 because it seemed more solid to me.

* There is no ladder. After white A, black B. 
With black I would not capture but play at C. White cannot cut, it gives you eye-space and buts some pressure on the 3 white stones.]
;B[je]LB[kf:a]C[* Capture indirect by playing at A. Keeps the pressure on the 3 white stones and gives black more eye-space.]
;W[lb]LB[iq:a]C[I'm thinking maybe this is a little slow? Could black connect without it?

* Think you are right it is a bit slow. Black cannot connect. 
For white play at A, 
- this attacks black 7
- prevents black's territory from expanding.];B[fo]C[Ok. Black tenuki's, sacrificing the top group. But white continues to attack. This is because I was not sure whether black might be able to save his group later by running downwards. So White plays a few gote moves. Are they wasted?

* 25 is a good move.
I think the to group almost lives (has already one eye getting another one should not be too difficult). Also 25 helps the black top group indirectly.]

(;W[dn]LB[el:a]C[Oops. That's right, I went here first. C6 is a vital point for black, so I figured it crucial to fix it. Is that aji-keshi? Or bad?

White does get some territory in the fix.

* 26 looks a bit slack. A is an option as wel, this expands white's area.]
;B[dr];W[cq]C[Again, fixing territory.

* this is too small. White also looks overconcentrated.];B[ko]
LB[kp:a]C[* seems a bit high.  playing at A will prevent white from invading.]

(;W[jj]LB[qk:a][ce:b]C[Ok. This is the move that the game hinged on.

I figured that K10 gave white a good chance of ruining black's upper group's chances of life. Also, I thought that it would offer support to an invasion stone somewhere at J5, which would really hurt black.

Black was aware of this, of course, so he played accordingly.

But the whole theory centers around the idea that K10 is a good move. It's hard to encircle so much territory with one stone. And indeed, black was able to invade and live inside.

* Problem with this move is that it is difficult to make territory in the centre especially with the black group on top. 
For white I think A is more important now. This will prevent black from expanding his moyo. 
Or play B to secure the left-top area.];B[cf]C[See? Right of the bat.]

(;W[ef]LB[ch:a]C[* play A first. this gives white some territory on the left and but's pressure on the black stone.]
;B[bd];W[ch]C[Here, white judged that to defend at C17, while securing half the corner, would be too passive, and allow black to get in the large base at C10.

Furthermore, by going at C12, white get's potentially more territory than black in the corner, or at least the same amount. And it helps seel black off from the center moyo, which I feel is very important. If white played at C17, what might have happened?

* 34 is a good move.];B[cc]C[* this is must for black now.]
;W[dg]LB[qf:a][np:b][kq:c]C[At this point, white cedes the corner for the moyo. It's a big gamble.

What I'd like to know is, how easy is it for black to reduce around F9-10?

If white responds with something like F7, I feel that would really hurt black by threatening to reduce his moyo and by securing white's, as well as attacking the stone at F10-9.

But is the moyo really that secure? Or am I missing something?

* The problem is that after playing 32 you thought the black top-group  is dead. Also 36 is based on this idea. 
Problem is that black is not dead. 
Right-side is now most important. Move at A is big.
Reducing move at B or invasion at C are hard to answer as well for black. This because 29 is too high.]

(;B[hl]MA[kf][jf][if][hf][gf][ff][fe][ge][eg][fg][gg][hg][ig]
[jg][kg][dh][eh][fh][gh][hh][ih][ii][hi][gi][fi][ei][di][fj]
[ej][dj]LB[pf:a][qj:b][gk:c][lh:d]C[This move isn't really effective as a reducing move. Or so I think.

What black meant with it was to threaten to connect with the black group on top, and while white respons, black could play something like L8 and get quite the big moyo himself. Is there a better response than what white did?

* The right side is now important. Move at A or around B gives white black infuence/territory on the right.
Also 37 does not really reduce  white's moyo. 
Determining how deep to invade largely depands on how the score is. When you are behind you have to invade deep, when you are ahead it is not needed to invade deeply, making a small intrusion is then sufficient. 
So in this case, assuming the black top group is dead, and black gets about half of the possible points on the right side (black has the most influence here).
Black:
Top left:  10 p
top right: 15 p
bottom right: 15 p
bottom:  30 p (when all turns into actual territory).
Problem is to determine how much territory black will get on the right side. When played at B I assume black will make about 15 points. 
In total 85 points, 

White:
Left. 24 p
Top: 26 p
Komi: 6 p
In total: 56 points, 
So white must get 29 points out of the left centre group,  When the marked points turn into territory (in total 30 points) score is close. 

To reduce black should first play around D (white will have to answer because otherwise he will pull out the pack group) an then switch to C, white will not be able anymore to make enough territory to win.

So in short, 37 is not deep enough.];W[hj];B[jl]C[* the rightside is more important]

(;W[kq]C[Now that black has a large moyo, I think the game favor's black. It was around this time that I felt sure that black had a good lead, not just because of the moyo, but I feel that black has more oportunities to expand.

As a result, I felt that white had a hard game ahead of her. Does black actually have a lead here, though?

I ask, because by the end of the game, white won by at least 16.5 points. Not exactly a commanding victory, but quite comfortable.

What I'd like to know is, is that lead allready hinted at in this position, or did it come about through white's desperate moves throughout the rest of the game?

Also, note that white tries to live inside black's moyo. But I had a hard time deciding where exactly to invade.

I considered N3, but decided in favor of L3. Is N3 better, however? Or worse? Is any other move better?

* 40 is a good move. 
When the top black group is alive white has about 30 points.  Black has at least 40 points and with much more potential territory. Ineed black is ahead.]

(;B[iq]C[* 40 is very hard to attack.
But 41 is to norraw. Black's chance on  new moyo are on the right side, so play there, I do not think it is possible for black to prevent white from living.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[jp]LB[or:a]C[* when you want to settle a group quickly you normally play A.]
;B[mp]C[* good move, expands black moyo.and removes the aji on this side.]
;W[gp];B[fp];W[hn];B[fm]TR[nq][kq][jp]LB[gr:a][cr:b][ip:c][or:d]
[mq:e]C[White tries her hand at a little sabaki. I've never tried sabaki before however, so some advice on this would be helpful.

Also, I think here that blacks makes the game losing move. F7 aims at capturing the entire group, which might be too greedy. As G3 allows white to threaten J3 and live completely unscathed!

If black had separated the two groups with J4 instead of F7, I think he would have had many more points that he ended up having, and thus, I feel this might be the losing move.

am I right?

*  49 at A is better, black almost lives (B will do the trick I think)
After A C will kill the marked stones. 
When white plays C, black 49 and I do not think white can live.

I think the problem is that there are too many black stones in this area as is so try to live immediatly.
So I think 44 should have been played at D.
Also not answering 45 by E (this will give you one eye) was a mistake.]
;W[gq];B[io];W[ip];B[ho];W[hp];B[pj]C[That sequence maybe was a little too easy for white. Did I miss something?

* see my comments at 49

55 is a good move but first settle the unfinshed business with the white bottom group..]

(;W[pg];B[mj];W[kk]LB[lg:a]C[How is this move, compared to a more moyo protecting one like M11?

Should M11 have been played instead?

Is there a way for Black to take advantage of L9?

Also, note that L9 threatens to reduce black's moyo just as N10 does.

But I think that white's moyo is much larger right now, so in retrospect, maybe L9 could have been forsaken?

Actually, I'm not sure which moyo is larger. If the K4 group dies, then black would have a huge moyo. Also, If black separates O3 from L3, the moyo increases quite the size as well. So maybe the game is not lost for black yet?

* I think white should protect his moyo. Black playing at A is unbearble for white.]

(;B[kl]MA[bg][fr][qh][lr]LB[lg:a][ll:b][le:c]C[I'm not sure about this move. too passive?

* Yes should be at A..
When you want to defend play B instead,

However defending against 58  is too small. this will only give you a few points. 

Playing at the X will give you more points then answering with 59.

But 59 should be played at A or .C to make a living group of black.]
;W[lk];B[ml];W[ll];B[lm];W[mk];B[nk];W[nl]C[* Black in trouble. Even defending wih 59 and 61 did not give much profit.]
;B[mm];W[nj];B[ok];W[ni]C[A sequence overall in favor of white. If her moyo was not larger than black's before, it most certainly is now.

* you are correct. This sequence was  a success for white. Also note that because of this stone 56 is not at all weak anymore.]
;B[qf]C[black takes what I think to be a rather large point.

* This is a big point, but black should live with his tob group.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[pi]
(;B[lq]LB[mq:a][qh:b]C[Perhaps Q11 could have been forsaken in favor of M3?

At this point in the game, my moves become much less sure.

There is more variance in my surety of what might be a good move, and I'm positive that I made some glaring mistakes. So feel free to point out at least three of them after this move. :D


* 74 is a big move, because not playing here black B will connect his 2 groups. 

However black should play C and then D to seal white in.];W[lr]
;B[mr];W[kr];B[qn]LB[fr:a][ir:b][bg:c]C[Now, L2 lived, but I think mostly because I was careless in reading, and didnn't think of black attacking that group.

However, I'm almost positive that unless white makes a move to protect her group, it could quite easily die.

In retrospect, every move white makes before finally saving G3 is the game losing move! lol. But I really should have saved it sooner.

At least, I think.

*  When the top-group lives game is still close.
Why did you play 79 ?  I think this move is not neccesary. 

This should be played at A, white B, black C.];W[fr];B[er];W[fs]
;B[eb]LB[eq:a][bg:b][gj:c]C[Oh. Ok, so I did save it sooner. Well actually no. Black still has the tesujii at H2, so I saved it, but failed to seal the deal until much later. As black, I didn't see the move until it was too late.

Bad reading skills...

* Problem is that white can cut now at A. This is why black playing at 80 was a big move. 

83 at B is sente, play here first then C to reduce white's territory.]

Then B to prevent the cut.];W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[en]LB[eq:a]
C[Ok, now, starting from this point, is the short endgame.

And I'm going to be honest here, I am terrible at endgame. I'm usually so overhwelmed by the board position that my plays are little better than random moves, even after minutes of thought.

From this point on, there will probably be many, MANY huge mistakes that could turn the tide of the game. I didn't see them. Feel free to point them out to me, but It will be difficult for me to play the endgame still for some time.


* In theory the end-game is the easiest part of the game (although I loose more games in the endgame then at any other part of the game).  
It does require a lot of counting. 
Example: what is a move at B13 worth ?
 
Note that cutting at A is extremely big (at least 12 points).]

And white wins by 16.5 points!

I was certain that black had won, or that the game was really much closer! lol! Bunny Says bad at counting!

Thanks to all of those who take the time to critique this game!

* Black was on top of the game most of the time. The game really turned with move 59 I think this was the game loosing move.

I do feel that the game was largely influenced by the fact that you thought the black group at the top was dead and really only at around move 130 this was the case, before that black had lot's of oppertunities to keep this group alive.

I also felt that you put a lot of emphasis on territory in the centre, It is easier to make territory in the corners and along the sides. It looked like you completely forgot there was a right side on board.

To get stronger, study openings till mid. game of professional games (so first 60 moves) this will give you a better sence of openings.  Seen this game I think this is the weakest point at the moment. 
Do not be too bothered about the endgame. The endgame is easier (me saying this, who looses most og his games because of his poor endgame) for this you need to count a lot, so simply play the move that is worth most points.

Hope the comments are usefull to you.,
