C[Hello, my name is Jared. I played black in this game. I've already recognized some major mistakes. However, I have a long way to improve before I could have easily won this one.

Hi, I've made a few comments. I'm only 4 kyu-ish, so please take my comments with a grain of salt. I could be wrong. Even so, I've noted some spots where I think things went wrong. Cheers.]

(;B[ms]LB[oo:A]C[This is an enormous error. Playing at A is absolutely essential. This move is gote, and white can snake all around the right side, keeping you from making anything happen over there.]
;W[oo]C[Disaster for black.]
(;B[on]LB[oh:B][on:2][no:1][po:3]SQ[oo][op][oq]C[Jared: I felt until this point I had done ok to shut down his corner. Perhaps I should have played O6? Q6?

At this point, you're in deep trouble. Whenever you have 2 diagonal moves like this with your opponent's stones in the middle, you open yourself up to a dangerous series of ataris. This is what white does. It's already too late at this point.

Avoid this 1,2,3 situation.];W[nn]C[It begins.];B[mo];W[pn]
;B[om];W[qn]C[Jared: By here I think I had lost the strength I had. I basically sacrificed the 3 stone group to  gain some influence elsewhere.

You made the right choice to let those go. They're caught in a crane's nest. No escape.]
;B[os];W[or];B[ns]LB[jd:3][de:4][ql:2][cn:1]C[This seqeunce gets you a few meager points in gote. Giving away sente at this point is worth a lot more. It's important to keep momentum in mind. Don't play endgame moves at this point. There are much bigger moves on the board. I've marked a few of them in (what I believe to be) the order of importance.]
;W[qq]C[This is gote for white. You've been givien another opportunity to play a big move.]
;B[nm]LB[mn:A]C[This is trouble. If white plays at A, you're in atari. See the variation.]
(;W[qk];B[qi]TR[qg]C[This is the right idea, but it goes a little too far. The marked spot seems safer.]
;W[qf]C[This move seems too aggressive to me. You should be able to separate your opponent's stones and profit from this mistake. See variations.]
(;B[qg]C[This move is bad news. White should Q14. It would threaten both sides.]
(;W[pg]SQ[pf]C[You might think about the crosscut here. You have enough support to trade the corner for the side.]
(;B[qh]C[Jared: I didn't think I would have enough space here to live, but otherwise I sacrificed the entire right side.

This move threatens to kill your group and your corner.];W[pe]
C[White kicks.]

(;B[og]LB[sd:B][og:A][sh:C]C[Jared: This was a mistake. Small play and easy to cut. I should have played P12 locally.

P12 is better shape and sente. M11 is also screaming out. You're leaving a cut open.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[of];B[nk]C[Jared: I thought this was a good move at the time, but it didn't seem to gain me anything.

You're right. This doesn't connect you or separate white. It just forces you to answer an atari and lose the initiative. Not good.]

(;W[rl]C[Lucky.];B[rj];W[jl]C[OK, white is vulnerable here. There is little eyespace and there are black walls everywhere. You need to profit from this somehow. You should attack in a way that builds a moyo (framework) for you. See variations.]

You played a lot of good moves and have a strong sense for important parts of the board. You just need to be more careful about giving away sente (initiative). It's particularly important to have it in the beginning of the game. Keep it up. Cheers.

For what it's worth, white can capture a bunch of black stones with L4. Variation shown,]
