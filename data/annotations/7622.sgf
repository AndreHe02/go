EV) Hello, this is your reviewer.  This was a short game, determined by fighting, so my comments will focus on that area.]

(;W[er]C[[EV\] Better to capture directly, I think, giving B no further forcing moves.  See variation.]
;B[fn];W[go];B[cq]C[[EV\] Why not atari once more on top? Especially since B is not using the forcing move at D2 anyway.]
;W[gn];B[fm]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Should white push here, or tenuki?

[EV\] I can understand pushing once, to avoid the B sente atari, but continued pushing from behind is bad.  Pushing also weakens the E6 aji.]
;W[gm];B[fl];W[gk];B[de]C[[EV\] Strange tenuki.  B should continue to answer on top.]
(;W[cg]C[[EV\] The jump to G9 carried a threat to press B down, which B ignored.  Make good on the threat!  See variation.]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[bd];W[fd];B[bc];W[bb];B[ci];W[fk];B[dl];W[eg]
;B[fe];W[ge]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Is G15 to aggressive of white? Should I play G16 instead, trying to take profit on top

[EV\] This seems like an overplay to me.  W is unlikely to be able to enclose B, and when B squeezes out, W will be left with cutting points.]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[df];W[bf]C[[EV\] Nice forcing move.];B[ab]C[[EV\] Dangerous.  Suppose W does not comply?]
(;W[cb];B[be];W[dg];B[ff]
(;W[fg]C[[EV\] Forcing B to squeeze through the two W positions is bad.  Just play H15 directly.  See variation.]
;B[gf];W[he];B[gg];W[ei]C[[EV\] This is just a connection, having no effect on B above or below.  A move one space to the right would give good shape above.  Alternatively, W could play directly against the C11 stone, attempting to connect in sente or leave a large capture for later.]
;B[hd]C[[EV\] Now the fight gets really complicated.  This aji was created by W earlier mistake.]
;W[ie];B[id]
(;W[ig]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: What bout white K16 instead of J13?]
;B[je];W[hg];B[gh];W[hj]C[[EV\] W must defend the corner before going for a kill.  B would still have to escape in the center, and W could take profit patiently.]

C[Wyermsu [1k\]: I didn't dare to play G10 instead of G11 to try to kill here, getting myself surrounded at the same time..]
;B[hh]
(;W[gj]C[[EV\] This move is hopeless, as B will now break out and capture some of the W enclosing stones.  Let's see if W can try something else ....]
;B[ih];W[jh];B[hf];W[ji];B[if]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Now the most important question, how should white use this wall? I coudn't figure out any good way..

[EV\] The game is over after this disaster.  No further comments.]

;W[kn];B[jo];W[jn];B[mj];W[mh];B[ni];W[og];B[pi]C[Wyermsu [1k\]: Failed attack on black O11, and now game is over for white I think..]

(;W[ih];B[gj];W[dj];B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[bj]C[[EV\] Hmm, does this work?]
;B[di];W[cj];B[bi];W[aj]C[[EV\] OK, W wins here, but what about the corner?]
;B[gb]C[[EV\] I am not sure who wins here.  Some sort of ko in the corner seems likely.  At least W would have a fighting chance.]

;B[gb];W[gc];B[hb]C[[EV\] Something like this maybe?  Looks like W dies in the corner.]
)
(;W[hb]C[[EV\] If W simply defends, B will have trouble saving both sides.]
))
(;W[he]C[[EV\] W should just defend patiently here, capturing the G16 cutting stone cleanly.]
;B[gf]C[[EV\] Suppose B plays here to escape.  Probably not the best move, but not terrible, since it creates H16 aji.]
;W[fg];B[gg]C[[EV\] Then W makes this exchange?  The last two moves clearly help B.  But this is the game result by transposition.]
))
(;W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cb];W[db];B[ba];W[ff]C[[EV\] It looks like W captures the outside stones, ending the game.]
))
(;W[en];B[do];W[fk];B[ek];W[ej];B[dk];W[dj];B[ck]C[[EV\] W can now get all these forcing moves in sente, plus the cut at G8 is protected.]
))
(;W[fr];B[er];W[fq];B[cq];W[en];B[do]C[[EV\] This looks like a better result for W.]
))
(;B[cp]C[[EV\] B can try this move.  W cannot really block to take the corner, because B has prepared a trap ....]
(;W[eq];B[cq]C[[EV\] This result is even.])
(;W[cq];B[ep];W[fo];B[dq];W[do];B[eo]C[[EV\] W has no good continuation.]
