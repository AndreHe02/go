C[ES: Peter, as far as your rating, do not worry too much about it.  If you play online, the system will soon be able to find a good level for you.  If you play live with a group, you will soon find a level.  If you play with just one friend, then if you win three times in a row, give them a hanidcap stone, and vice-versa.  Your play may be stronger than 25k, you may want to try: http://www.motorscope.com/dojo/tests/

ES: General comments on the game.  Do not focus on killing your opponents stones.  Work to make fewer groups - connect weak groups that you have.]
;B[qd];W[pq];B[dc];W[dp]C[ES: Solid opening.];B[qo];W[oc]LB[np:C]
[mq:B][nq:A]C[ES:  Odd, but valid move, indicates that white wants to fight.  A, B, or C is more common, working to secure a base.]
;B[mc];W[pe]LB[qd:B][oe:A]C[ES: A is more common.  With black's stone at B, I think this can be cut, see variations.]

(;B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[ph]LB[qg:A]C[ES: A was good technique by black. White's move in response is very aggressive.]
;B[mp]
(;W[qp]LB[po:B][rp:A]C[ES: Very small, suggest A instead.  A forces a response by black at B, then white is strong on the outside and black has a small corner.]
;B[po]
(;W[nr]TR[rp][nq][mr]C[Peter: Is move 16 ok here or is one of the triangle better?

ES: I like the move you made.  See variations];B[jq]LB[qk:A]
C[Peter: Is 17 at A not better for development?

ES:  Yes, I like A very much, huge for black.];W[cf];B[ch];W[ck]
LB[ed:B][fd:A][cf:D][ef:C]TR[dp]C[Peter: I doubt if i should play on C, A or B instead. But I was afraid of isolating the marked stone.

ES: C is important to give any value to the stone D.  A is OK too.  your hoshi stone in the bottom left is fine.]
;B[cn];W[cd]LB[cd:G][ed:A][fd:B][cf:F][ef:C][ck:H][cn:E][fq:D]
C[Peter: What to do here? I would like to play C, but then the square marked stone could get under attack?

ES: This is a big fight in the making.  D would have been the commn response to E.  F-G is a very small base, it will need an entension to the middle to live.  Better to play C before G.  H was the problem play that started the big fight.]
;B[cc];W[bp]LB[fq:A][gq:B]C[ES: Small, A or B is better.];B[mr]
LB[mq:B][nq:A]C[ES: Bad gote attack by black.  Forces A which forces B.  While it is a nice wall of black, there are bigger plays...]
;W[nq];B[mq];W[gq]LB[hc:A][hd:B]C[ES: Excellent, larger corner for white.  Now A or B is huge.]
;B[jd];W[ef]LB[fc:A][cd:B][cf:D]C[ES: Maybe consider A?  But your play is good to give the B-D group a chance at life.]
;B[eh];W[bd]LB[gf:A]C[ES: A is better.  Extend to middle.];B[gd]
LB[gf:A]C[ES: Secures LARGE Area for black at top, given the nature of this game, I might have played A to make the small white group fight for life.]
;W[gf]C[ES: Very good!];B[rb]C[ES: Very weak];W[qc]LB[pc:A]
[pd:B]C[Peter: Was this wise?

ES: I prefer "foolhardy".  What will white do if black plays A or B?  See variations.]

(;B[rc];W[qb];B[ra]C[ES: This move is worth two points, VERY small.]
;W[qa]LB[pd:A]C[Peter: Is A better?

ES: A is MUCH MUCH better.]
(;B[en];W[ek]LB[pc:C][df:B][dk:A]C[ES: White now has three groups at A, B,& C that must all fight for life.  Do not be afraid to let some stones die.]
;B[gh];W[hg]LB[pd:F][df:A][if:E][bg:D][bh:B][bi:C]TR[ip][ir]
C[Peter: This felt good but i don't know if that feeling was correct. Other good points (triangle)?

ES:  You are correct for responding locally, the A group still does not have a base.  B, as you have suggested may be good, forces C then D, so is gote.  I like your suggestion of E best, as it threatens to connect with the group at F.]
;B[pd]C[ES: Ouch, the hammer falls.];W[od]
(;B[gn]LB[pd:A][oe:B]C[ES: Balck did not see the reson for playing A...  Should have cut at B, very urgent.  See variation.]

(;W[gk]LB[ne:A][hh:B]C[Peter: Didn't know what else to do.

ES: Secure at A, Cut at B.  See variations.];B[in];W[hj]LB[hh:A]
C[Peter: It was better to attack at A

ES: Yes.  Play more slowly?];B[qf]C[ES: Too early.  Not reallu a weakness for black, helps make white stronger with response.]
;W[pg];B[hh];W[ig]LB[ih:A]C[ES: Consider double hane to A instead.]
;B[dj];W[dk]LB[ih:A][ii:B]C[ES, better to cut-off balck and connect the group than try to save everything.]
;B[ii];W[ih]LB[ih:A][hi:B]C[ES: Too late the hane cannot be cut, A & B are miai]

;W[qm]C[ES: Very good.];B[fl];W[fk];B[qj]SQ[hj][ck][dk][ek]
[gk]C[Peter: could i have played 76 at 77 and still rescue the marked stones?

ES: I do not see that the white stones can be saved at all.  Black is so far ahead right now, 30-40 points.  White needs to save the marked group to have any chance, reducing the black center/left side territory and white must create territory in the center.  Yo did a remarkable job to save those stones and accomplish all of the goals.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[bi];B[bh];W[ci];B[di];W[cm];B[dm];W[cj];B[am]
;W[al];B[qh]C[ES: HUGE mistake by black.  Possibly the one move the loses the game.]

(;W[bk]C[ES: Good move, threatens the possibility of two eyes..  See variations]

;B[gc];W[fe];B[ln];W[pj]C[ES:  Now White is ahead, perhaps as much as 20 points.  White can afford to be very conservative and secure while reducing black's territory.]

;B[nf];W[of];B[ne];W[kh];B[hl];W[nh]LB[md:B][mg:A]C[ES:  I understand that you are concerened about life and death between A and B groups.  Count the liberties.  Prior to white's play, black has three, and white has four.  With an eye toward being conservative, I revise my opinion of your play in this area higher.]
;B[gl];W[rj]LB[rl:A]C[ES: Very good, punish black for not responding to A]

ES: Your move forces C, then you can play A.  My rule of thumb, a forcing one pint move is the same value as a two point move.]
