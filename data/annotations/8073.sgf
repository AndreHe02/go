C[Brakeshoe - Okay I have submitted this game because there definitely is something to correct. I think my fuseki is real bad in this. I often play the 5th move as an approach to black's corner when I play white and I approach whites corner if I play as black. I don't know if this is good.

     I put a lot of comments in this for you to see what I have thought throughout the game,  you can simply say yes or no to most of them but some require an explanation.

 Thanks a lot, Brakeshoe

[Hi!  My comments appear in Brackets.  I agree that there is a lot of room to improve in your fuseki.  Hopefully come of my comments will get you thinking about it in the right way.  Right now it seems you identify what you need to do well, but just place the stones in a way that doesn't necessarily support your objective.\]]
;B[qd]C[Brakeshoe [11k\]: gggl];W[pp];B[dc]
(;W[cp]TR[dq]C[Brakeshoe - Is D3 better? I often play D3 and a starpoint in the opening.

[Typically it is thought of as "bad" to play D3 as white.  D3 allows your opponent to approach you in a way that works well with his stone in the opposing corner.  See the variation.  Black isn't afraid of this, as he can make a shimari before white can play the approach.  For instance, black's play of D17 here is fine because W is likely to take the remaining corner rather than approach, and if W does approach B gets the corner.\]]
;B[cf]SQ[jd]C[Brakeshoe - I found that move large but I didn't know if i had a chance to attack it. ( Last variation fo move 7 - Do you have to go for a 10th line move now as W ? )

[This is the "large low shimari," and it is a standard way to play.  The "small low shimari" (C15) is more secure and more common, but smaller.  This shape can be attacked, but W will not want to do that right away without any stones in the area.  Here there is a "must play" for W, and it is in the marked area.  Whenever your opponent makes a shimari (corner enclosure) the extension from that enclosure is quite large, and it is almost always correct to cover it yourself.  Just doing that will help your fuseki quite a bit.  Also, whenever you play a shimari, have in mind that if your opponent doesn't cover the extension you should make it as soon as you can.\]]
(;W[oc]C[Brakeshoe - I Approached R16 in an attempt to reduce black's top, looked like if i played else where he made a monster out of it.

[This is okay, but not as good as disallowing the extension around K16.  It is much better than the variation where you play at J3.\]]
;B[kd]C[[This is very nice for B.  He gets his extension, but makes it very difficult for you to make a counter-pincer and threaten it.  Remember that you said the point of P17 was to reduce B's top.  This actually helped him make the monster at the top.  Now you have to really put some pressure on his R16 stone to make up for it.\]]
;W[lc]C[[Aak, this is no good.  You are trying to cram in a base here, but that's just asking for B to attack you, which will help you make a living shape up there, but will also help him create his massive framework.  You want to run out at this point, perhaps at Q15, so that B must defend his R16 stone.  That way you build influence facing B's territory.  This way you are fighting for a tiny bit of territory right next to a huge opponent's framework.  That is a situation you never want to be in.  Another way to look at this situation is that W is going to have a somewhat weak group.  Not in danger, but just weak.  In exchange for that, you must also ensure that B has a weak group.  If not, you will be way behind.  This move doesn't make a weak group for B, so it is "bad."\]]
;B[pc]
(;W[od]C[Brakeshoe - Here I am weak to bM16 I think, maybe I should have raised on the left.

[This is actually the only response to that move.  If B plays this point he has a massively strong tiger's mouth shape on top of your stone.  And time this shape occurs you want to play the extension you just did.  Incidentally, this is bad for W because now you have an inefficient shape.  When making a base, the standard rule is to make a two-point jump (i.e. P17 is a two point jump from M17).  However, if you are making a base from two stones, you should make a three-point jump.  Here you made the correct two-point jump, but then B forced you to play the next stone, which means now your two-point jump is too small.  That was probably B's idea here.  It's good to recognize situations in which your opponent can force this move and to avoid making a two-point jump.  However, despite that loss of effeciency, you cannot allow B to play P16, so this move is still correct.  See variations.\]]
(;B[qh];W[jb]LB[ic:C][qf:A][dj:B]C[Brakeshoe - Took this as an opportunity to make a good base.

[What you had was already sufficient base for the time being.  At this point I would consider the marked moves.

A attempts to make up for having let B get away without a weak group.  It is a fighting move that will push B up against your established group.

B attempts to match B's big framework.  It threatens a move around E4, which would give you the dreaded shimari+extension that I told you never to allow your opponent to get.

C is an invasion of sorts, but it is trying to use the fact that you actually have an established group at the top and you can push your opponent against it.  This means your opponent has to decide between attacking that new stone and also allowing L16 to be attacked or running with L16 and allowing you to establish a base inside his framework (which would be great for you).\]]
;B[kc];W[kb];B[hc];W[jc]C[[This is small at this point, B could have ignored it and taken a big point like E4.\]]
;B[jd];W[of]C[Brakeshoe - I went for a one point jump for it has some aji on the right, leaving my M17 weak.

[Your M17 is certainly not weak right now.  When you're thinking about attacking, you shouldn't be wanting to create "aji" for your opponent.  Aji is just sort of a byproduct of bad shapes or what's left over after you choose the lesser of two evils.  Sometimes you can make a clever move that leaves your opponent with aji, but that is never the driving force behind the move.  The move is always doing something else first.  If you want to attack.. Attack!  Wasting an early game move to create a little aji is way way too slow.  You could use that move to create a real threat, say at R14, or to expand your framework at D10.\]]
;B[ep]C[Brakeshoe - Do I want to pincer to strenghten the bottom?

[Yes, when your opponent moves between your two corner stones, all else being equal, the standard move is to pincer.\]]
;W[cn]C[[This is very passive.  It gives B a free pass to make a group within your framework.  He happily obliges.\]]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[Brakeshoe - In an attempt to get some on the right..

[This move appears at times in pro games, but it's designed to give W a big corner while allowing B major thickness in what is supposed to be your framework.  I prefer the pincer.\]]
;B[dp]
(;W[bq]C[[This is wrong, see variation.\]];B[cr];W[dr]C[Brakeshoe - Is the variation an avenue?

[Yes, the variation would be better for B, and is probably why the standard joseki doesn't proceed this way, as W can't avoid that outcome.\]]
(;B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[dn]C[Brakeshoe - Decided to sacrifice the 3 stones and get some influence on left, looked like I got nothing for left nor bottom.

[Noo!!  Just look at the difference!  Here B gets a huge corner, there is little hope for your D2 stones, and you still don't have a base for the C6 stones!  That corner may not be the best thing ever, but you cannot give it up here!  There is a go proverb that goes "You lose 5 points every time you change your mind."  That is what I see happening here.  You've selected a joseki that is based on getting the corner, then you give up the corner.  If you wanted the top side, you should have selected a joseki that would give it to you.\]]
;B[br];W[bn];B[ap];W[do];B[aq];W[bj]TR[cj]C[Brakeshoe - Now i think this is bad, I got a stone short later because of this, C10 much better I think.

[Yes, the second line is not for extensions.  C10 is what you want.  This gives some perspective on why sacrificing the corner was bad.  Just look at B's position here.. he rules that corner and the nearby bottom with an iron fist.  You are left with an okay but not great group on the side.  Oh dear..\]]
;B[nq];W[lq];B[qq]
(;W[qp]C[[This is atypical.  You want to separate the two black stones.  This move is only played if you have something on the right side that it works well with.  See the variation.\]]
;B[pq];W[rp]CR[ji][ij][kj]C[[This is wrong.  It gives B a beautiful tiger's mouth shape at P4.  Any time your opponent can make a tiger's mouth over your stones it is bad.  You need to play P4 here.  (I made a tiger's mouth with the circle marks in case that term isn't familiar to you.. it goes by several names.)\]]
;B[rq]C[[B lets you off the hook.\]];W[qk];B[rj];W[qf]C[[Good!  This is a perfect time to play this attack.  B has committed to live with R12 and certainly must live in the corner, but you can separate those two groups.  You can gain a lot as he tries to keep them both alive.\]]
;B[rf]
(;W[rk]C[[Ack!  But follow through!  Every time you change your mind you lose 5 points!  See variations.\]]
;B[pe];W[pd]C[[Defend your attacking stone instead!  You can still separate him!\]]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[qe];W[qj];B[ri]C[[Okay, let's pause.  Compare this situation to what it looked like when you played R14 (move 46).  The only thing W has gained here is to pick off the Q17 stone.  B now has a lovely living group.  Your instinct to attack there was great, but you immediately backed away.  Remember, whatever purpose you assign to your moves, you should commit to.  If you realize all of a sudden that your reading was just dead wrong.. okay, maybe you have to pack it up and minimize the loss.  But here it seems you just volunarily put up the white flag and let your R14 stone go.  If you had no intention of using that stone, why did you play it?  Make sure you keep in mind the purpose of your stones.

As a side note, this is actually one place that humans are far superior to computers.  A computer looks at the board basically fresh every move.  There is no coherent long-term strategy.  This leads the computer to suffer from "changing its mind" too often.  Make sure you, as a human, don't get pulled into the same trap.  Make a good plan for the stone you're about to play and, unless you suddenly realize it's going to be drastically different from what you thought, stick to it.\]]
;W[iq]C[[This is not very urgent.  P4 is still huge and it may be time to try to reduce B's upper left corner with a move like G14.]
;B[gq];W[np]LB[kf:2][mf:1][ch:7][di:3][nk:6][fn:4][ho:5]C[Brakeshoe - Is it desperate? I was looking for other moves.  Is one of the numbered moves a better option to O4?

[I would have gone with P4 to avoid the tiger's mouth, but this isn't necessarily bad.  I guess the question is, what is its purpose?  Avoiding the tiger's mouth is a good purpose for a move, so this one needs a better one.  Did you read out the result here?  If not, you should start doing that ;)

As for the other moves you indicate, what is the purpose of each one?  Answering that question will go a long way toward evaluating them.  Also, think about which ones would hurt you the most if your opponent were to play them.  That is another good way of evaluating moves.  Addressing the weakness at the bottom as you have done is, in my opinion, the most urgent thing on the board right now, so I agree with your assessment in that regard.\]]

;B[lp]C[Brakeshoe - Should I have taken the ko back? I thought I had to secure bottom.

[Take the ko for sure.  If you do that you can just capture the O3 stone to secure the bottom or, if he defends that stone, play L4.  Keeping those two B groups disconnected is huge.\]]

I know as a new player it can be hard to read out a sequence, but I will generally remind myself that 2 or 3 times in a game reading will be crucial and probably have a big effect on the outcome, so I just buck up and take the time to do it.

C[Black wins by 6.5pts

[Okay, most of the general commentary I have is contained within the game.  I think the primary thing for you to work on is identifying an immediate purpose for each move, and then making sure you make that stone fulfill its purpose with your subsequent moves.  Of course, when I say the proverb "you lose 5 points every time you change your mind" it may actually be the case that you didn't change your mind at all.  However, the stones "look" like they were played be someone who changed his mind about their purpose.  This is probably because their purpose wasn't clearly determined to begin with.  Every stone should be played to do X or to keep my opponent from doing Y (preferrably both at once).

I guess another thing to add is that when a stone is supposed to "do X" that thing should be as specific as possible.  For instance, if we look at move 6, you say the purpose is to keep B from making a monster at the top.  However, in the end that move is part of what helps create that monster.  So what you need to be thinking is "this move will probably get this response, which will allow this move" type of thing.  The response move 6 got was a lovely pincer that created a lot of problems for you.  The move I recommend in that situation, K16, has a very specific purpose: "To keep B from playing the extension there."  So make your purposes explicit and then your stones will end up doing what you wanted them to do a lot more often.

As for the fuseki, always keep in mind that you want to be making your opponent form weak groups and not to be forming them yourself.  Avoid small bases and use threatening moves to give yourself a relief valve.  Don't feel like you have to live small in the opening.  If you are doing that you are creating a lot of work for yourself later.\]]
