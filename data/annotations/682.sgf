;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc]C[Standard and calm knight's move response to black's knight's move corner approach.]
;B[qe]C[Unusual corner approach by black.  This fails because it does more to strengthen white (one move to get corner) than black.  Although this move does not touch white, it has the same effect, inducing white to extend from one stone and become much stronger.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[od]C[This move by white is solid, but too slow.  White should jump two to three spaces, probably two, on the third line.]
;B[pj]C[This move is one space too far for black from a two stone extension.  There is no reason for black not to make the standard 3-space extension here, threatening to make a large moyo on the right side.  As it is, black is left open on both sides of this stone.]
;W[pn]C[Sensing this, white tests black's intentions.  This is a reasonable start by white.  Other good spots are on the third line or one line further from the corner on the 3rd or 4th lines.]
;B[on]C[Black is aiming either to capture white (which should not be possible) or to make a wall from the corner stone with strength extending along the open side.]
;W[ql]C[This move is poorly timed and probably one space too short. Important point--in such a case as this, do not try immediately to make eye
shape and live.  Instead, white has many forcing (kikashi) moves to make first before diving towards the side to live.  This knight's move
is too heavy a move here, leading towards heavily clumped stones which can be easily captured.  White should either push up from his first
stone or play above and then below the touching stone to work his way into black's area on the bottom or corner.  If black simply offers
this touching stone up as a sacrifice, white should take it and then extend.  A saying to keep in mind is "run first, eye shape later".
To this, I'd add run in such a way as to make most trouble for your opponent.]
;B[qk]C[White's heavy move invited this excellent response which strengthens the group of 4 black stones while further threatening white.]
;W[pl]C[White's stones are getting dangerously heavy.];B[ok]
;W[qp];B[qo]C[This move is an overreach by black.  White should cut and capture it (the corner white stone will live to capture either it or the 4-4 stone
or both).];W[qn]C[Instead, white makes the bamboo connection--very useful at times, but far too heavy here.  At this point, white should not be able to live
with these stones without running, but black makes several mistakes, allowing white to live.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[qq];W[rn];B[po];W[jp]C[White's only chance to break out is to play q7 then push.]
;B[om]C[This move should be sufficient to kill white, but black allows white to live.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[rm];B[sk];W[rl]C[White can only make one eye if black played correctly.  If white closes the eye on the 4th line, black pushes in on the first line from the
corner.  When white plays atari on this stone, black ignores it and pushes in one more on the first line from the other side.  Now white can
make only a false eye on the edge, even if he captures the single black stone in atari.]
;B[cd];W[pm];B[sp]C[This is the move that allows white to live.  Black should have played as indicated before, one space further along the first line, ignore
atari and push from the other side then connect.  Even though white captures the single black stone, he does not have a true eye and dies.]
;W[so];B[sl];W[sm];B[dc];W[ed];B[sj];W[df];B[ec];W[fe];B[dj]
;W[fp];B[ep];W[fq];B[er];W[nq]C[This is overaggressive by white.  Black should immediately invade inside of white on the third line midway between these two stones.  Either
this stone will be captured or white's territory will be greatly diminished.  Black does white a favor with a mild response.]
;B[oq];W[nr];B[or];W[mo]C[Good shape move for white.];B[ns]
C[Far too early for first line move unless a life-and-death situation, which this is not.  Black should look for much larger moves elsewhere,
on the other side of the board.];W[ms];B[os];W[mr];B[mn];W[lo]
;B[mm]C[Very weak move by black.  The bamboo joint isn't needed this point, this makes for no greater influence in the area, doesn't threaten white,
and makes no territory.  This hands sente to white needlessly.  Black should play on the other side of the board.]
;W[je]C[Black's move allows white this move.  This is too aggressive by white, however.  Black *should* counter with something like a peep at g16  followed by a 3rd line stone below this fifth line white stone.  Black can then live in either direction.  Black could also invade on the
third line closer to white's 3 stone corner wall.];B[de]C[Black's move is very small here.]
;W[ee];B[ce];W[nf]C[Reasonable move by white.  White is still easily invadable inside this moyo, but black does not start one now while there is a chance.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[og];W[ng]C[Excellent move.  Look for these double meaning moves any time you can find them.  It simultaneously increases white's strength while
threatening black.  Black ignores this play only at his own peril.]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[dm]C[Don't be afraid to go ahead and invade on the third line.  This is far too wide a gap for white not to live in.  Whichever side black
answers from, white can jump out one space, then, if needed, dive to the 2nd line under the opposite stone.  In any case, black's
moyo is cut to pieces.  This is not so much an invasion as a test, and a weak one.]
;B[dn];W[em];B[dl];W[en]C[white should have pushed on through on the third line.  He should
not give black the entire side by allowing him to link up underneath.  He needn't worry about living, as he can connect either above or below for life.]
;B[cm];W[dh];B[fn];W[fo];B[eo];W[fm];B[gn];W[go];B[gm];W[fl]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[gj];W[fj];B[fi];W[ei];B[ej];W[gk];B[hk];W[gi]
C[White punishes black for overaggressiveness.  Black seems to be far too atari-happy.]
;B[fh];W[hj];B[hi];W[hl];B[ik];W[hn]C[Reasonable move by white, but pushing out at j10 further punishes black by keeping these attacking stones separated.  If white pushes out and
links up to the right, he has a huge territory.  Note, white can be easily cut and captured at e14.]
;B[ij];W[hm];B[gj];W[gh];B[hj];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg];B[dg];W[ef]
;B[cg];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci]C[Keep asking: is this the largest move on the board?  There are a number of much larger moves.  Once a local fight is settled, don't get lulled into
continuing with small end moves.  Keep thinking of the whole board.  Pushing in at o14 then turning the corner at r16 is worth more than 10
points.  F2, closing the opening to white's area is very large.  E18 is very large.]
;B[cj];W[eb]C[Good, worth about 10 points.  My only quibble is that it hands sente back to black.  F2 would not do that (black must respond or face
unreasonable loss).  Pushing in at p14 would keep sente.  Make sure you push there before you turn the corner.]
;B[db];W[fb];B[bi];W[re]C[White's move in this area is in the wrong sequence.  By turning first, black blocks and white must connect.  Then black gets the free move
to close the opening.  If white pushed first, then turned the corner, black still must waste another stone inside his area to connect the
wall or be faced with double atari from white.];B[rf];W[rd]
;B[of];W[jh];B[lj];W[ll]C[This move is still much smaller than F2.  Neither side should get much territory out here, if played well, so the side move is much more
profitable.];B[kl];W[km]C[White's first play is now a wasted sacrifice.  Sacrificing is good where it gains you something greater.  Instead white should extend from
his first stone.  He will live to the bottom or side and still be present inside of black's territory.]
;B[lm];W[jl];B[kk];W[kn];B[jk];W[il];B[kh];W[kg];B[ji];W[lh]
;B[ki];W[ih];B[ml];W[no];B[nn]C[The remainder is the end game.  See comment near end.]
;W[dr];B[eq];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[es];W[gr];B[hh];W[hg];B[kf]
;W[jg];B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[md];B[ld];W[mf];B[ke]

;W[sf];B[sg];W[rg];B[se];W[sd];B[rh];W[sf];B[qg];W[se];B[np]
;W[mp];B[tt]C[Black errs seriously in passing here.  There are still many open points to be contested.  The entire large black side territory is not
counted, nor is the
black center side territory because there are openings yet to be filled.  The only black territory counted is the small corner (12 points).
If black had played to close all open points, this would have been a close finish, with a small advantage to white.  You don't need to fill
in dame points, but open points should be played.

White's instincts are generally solid.  Main points to consider.  During opening, stay with large moves.  In an invasion, play lightly.
When a local battle ends, look elsewhere immediately.];W[tt]
