C[Hi,

my name is Rainer (Beholder) 6k and I did the review for this game, mainly for Black (danieleff).

Generally Black could have done better if playing less agressive and more solid.
Black would have lost if White made less endgame mistakes.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[ip]LB[jp:A]C[Beh: To play at A is better.];W[cj];B[oc]LB[fc:A]
C[Beh: Why not play at A?];W[qo];B[qm]C[Beh: Probably the most aggressive answer.]
;W[oo]
(;B[mq]LB[np:A]C[Beh: This move is a bit slow. The play at A would be joseki.]
;W[rq]C[Beh: White is trying to make a base.];B[qr];W[mo];B[om]
C[danieleff: Maybe R10 would have been better. I thought white will run, but with S3, its quite poweful (even alive?), so he counterattacked.

Beh: Too early to say if White is alive or not. White definitely has the potential to be alive.]
;W[qj]
(;B[pj]LB[mm:A]C[Beh: This strengthens the white stone. Why not continue the run with A?]
;W[pi];B[oj];W[qk];B[qh]C[danieleff: I thought this was forcing enough, but he just connected the 2 weakish white groups. oops.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[qn]
(;B[pm]LB[rl:A]C[Beh: Why not a play at A (see variations)?]
;W[rl];B[qi];W[jd];B[oh]C[danieleff: If he gets out this cutting stone, I have a floating black goup. Maybe lost a move here?

Beh: This move helps to defend the corner against an invasion at A. A play elsewhere would perhaps be better because there are still bigger points left.]
;W[kq];B[lp]C[danieleff: separate this from N5, and attack was my strategy]
;W[ir];B[hr]C[Beh: This move is not good. Don't touch a stone you are attacking.]
;W[iq]C[danieleff: I hoped he wouldl not H3. I think that would look pretty bad for me

Beh: Yes, H3 would have been bad.];B[hq];W[jp];B[ho];W[jo];B[lo]
;W[jn];B[mn];W[jl];B[cl]C[Beh: The upper right and top are more important.]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[dk]
(;W[em];B[ck]C[danieleff: Actually this was my intention, but he got a ponnuki.

Beh: You got youself a weak position and White got stronger.]
;W[cr];B[ds];W[cs];B[bm];W[bn];B[dj];W[cd];B[cg];W[gc];B[jb]
TR[dh][er][mr]C[Beh: It would be better to defend you weak groups before attacking. The marked attacks would be severe.]
;W[jf]C[Beh: Not a good move.];B[lc];W[eg];B[rr]C[Beh: Small, but helps to settle the group.]
;W[rp];B[no];W[on];B[gm];W[jj];B[gk];W[gi];B[hg]C[danieleff: Big center moyo was forming here, had to invade.

Beh: Better to invade earlier as it could be hard to survive here.]

C[danieleff: I think this was quite OK for me.];W[if];B[ik]
;W[jk];B[im];W[jm];B[il];W[nd]C[Beh: Too deep and too near to Blacks position.]
;B[le];W[mg];B[ne];W[nf];B[oe];W[of];B[pf];W[ic];B[hc];W[hb]
;B[ef]C[danieleff: Had to secure that big group.];W[ib]C[danieleff: I dunno if black J18 would do anything.

Beh: It would have been possible to play J18 before F14 as it would connect Blacks group if White would not respond with G18. Minimum win for Black would be 1 point.]
;B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[jg];B[mh]C[danieleff: It seemd that the 3 O14 stones are mine too...]
;W[nh];B[mi];W[ni]
(;B[mf]C[danieleff: O10 could work, but I had so many cutting points, I was not sure

Beh: O10 would have been possible, too.];W[oi];B[mj];W[nj]
(;B[ng]C[danieleff: Maybe try should have tried to save P10 stones, but decided not to, he would definitely fight to save O11 group now.

Beh: The White group would get out nevertheless.];W[nk];B[kh]
C[danieleff: I should have saved with O7 at least. Big loss

Beh: Yes.];W[nm]C[Beh: White won about 10 with this move.];B[ml]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[jh];B[be]C[danieleff: Looked like the biggest point in the open.]
;W[bd];B[ce];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bg];W[si]C[danieleff: endgame moves from here.]
