C[Hello, I'm Playing White in this game.  I lost horribly and i should have resigned but I was too stuborn and wouldn't quit.  can you help me and tell me some alternative moves I could have made.  At some points in the game, I didn't know where to go. Can you also give me some move variations.

Hi, I hope you find it useful, I haven't had the time to play as much as I like so am a little rusty.  In the review I mostly point out the mistakes (by both sides) as I think this is the best way to learn.  You played some good moves here and got yourself out of some tricky situations, but you probably know these moves were good so I focus on the bad ones :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[dn]LB[jq:B][dr:A]TR[iq]C[was that a good defense

Yes. This is a joseki move. Two better responses by black are shown.]

(;B[iq]C[This move is a little slow I think being on the third line and close to F3.  I prefer K3.]
;W[pn]LB[nc:2][qf:3][qn:1]C[was it good to attack here.  The time limits for each move were low, so i didn't get that much time to think

This is a reasonable attack.  Other possibilities are shown.

This attack does allow black to consolidate his position in the corner.  You could have left this corner alone and later invaded.]
;B[qn]
(;W[op]LB[qm:B][po:A]TR[fq][iq]C[was this a good move?

No, your stones can easily be cut off as shown when B plays A

Also the area above Q6 is of more interest to you because of the marked group.]

(;B[pq];W[po];B[qo];W[oq];B[pr]
(;W[no]LB[nc:B][pm:A]C[should I have played eslewhere

I think that A is better, it would have avoided the problems that follow and still protects the cut.

Tenuki (B) is not an option.];B[pm];W[om]LB[on:A]C[was this a good counter because i think this is what messed me up

The mistake was one move earlier.  Black could proceed at A.]

As I see it you have two groups, you need to ensure the survival of both.]

(;W[oo];B[nn]
(;W[mn];B[nm]LB[ko:2][lo:1][lp:3]C[Should I have made a one space jump from mve 7 to make a base there.?

You should be thinking about ensuring the survival of this group so perhaps the marked moves are better.]

;W[mo]C[I think anythng but the solid connection is better - consider eye shape]
;B[mk];W[pf]LB[pg:2][qg:1]TR[ok][pk][pl]C[Where else could i have moved

Perhaps a more distant approach in light of the weak group you have.]

You needed to protect the marked group. This move is ok];B[qd]

C[This is where I ran out of time. So can you please give me some advice so that I can become a better player. Thank you.


Generally:

You allow yourself to be cut into too many groups. It is unsurprising that only groups 1-5 are alive and groups 1,3 and 4 could all have been easily killed by black as we saw.

Always be aware how many groups you have and if they can form to eyes easily or connect to a living group. If they are in danger save them (if you can) - urgent moves before big moves.

Try to play more solidly, more straight lines. 

In the beginning try to attack your opponent stones in a way that benifits you more - see move 10 for example. In this game I think the bottom left corner went badly for you, which led to problems further on. This shows the importance of the opening moves.  Had you played move 10 differently the game may have gone much better.

Finally, avoid short time limits when you are still learning (as I am too), you need time to think things through.

Good luck in your next game.];W[ad];B[ac];W[ae])
