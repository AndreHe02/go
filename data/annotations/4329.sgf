C[itso [2k\]: hi
BabyJesus [4k\]: enjoy your game  :-)
itso [2k\]: have a good game!


##### This is an Iwamoto Tournament game where I played white against a 2k.  I won by 7.5 points and thought this would be a good game for review since it took just about 3 hours to complete.  I have made detailed comments about what I was thinking at various points and specific questions I had.  Thank you for your time reviewing.  All of my comments will begin with ######.

Hello BabyJesus,

Firstly, I'm only three stones stronger than you, so take anything I say here with a grain of salt.  That said, I did give my review to a strong 4d to go over and make sure I didn't make any large errors.  Where I have, I have left my error but also given the correction.

Overall, the game felt tightly fought, with black trying repeatedly to get a sudden win but not being successful.  You fell behind a little, perhaps due to the lower right, and then got ahead after the capture on the left.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[##### I generally dislike playing against the moyo that emerges from the chinese opening, so I decided to break the moyo early.  I was concerned about having to invade a large moyo that belongs to a stronger player.
--
Fair enough, personally I don't mind it.  

Studies from pro games show playing Q5 here tends to lead to black winning but then I'm not sure how applicable that is to amateur games.]
;B[ql]C[###### I really didn't know how to reply to this pincer.  I would appreciate suggestions on how to respond.
--
I haven't seen R8 in this situation, the closest I have seen is Q8, which white answers with something like N4.  Based on that, I'd be looking to build a base on the lower side, encouraging black to protect Q3 so as to retain sente and take the remaining corner.

The other option which I've seen quite a lot is to simply tenuki now.  Black will shortly follow up with either O4 or R5, but since Q5 is high it is still useful. That is how I personally would play.]
;W[qq];B[qr]C[##### I left R3 as a forcing move and played elsewhere, knowing that I was leaving a weak stone, but looking to develop my opening quickly.
--
I agree that you would like to tenuki, but R4 is forcing and helps white more than black, so I think you should play that first.  After you tenuki, black can continue the attack with P8.

The person I asked was not so convinced, saying after R4 white cannot make sabaki.]
;W[dc];B[np];W[no]C[--
I'm not convinced you should answer O4, it feels like the wrong direction and so I would be tempted to leave it for O17.

If you are going to answer then you're inevitably going to become heavy, so I would exchange R4 for P2 first.]
;B[mp];W[ol];B[qi];W[ci]C[##### again, i was stressing quick development.  I figured that with P8, i was reasonably safe.]
;B[fq];W[fp]C[--

I do not like F4 here.  D6 is much more common because this feels like it helps N4.]
;B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[ml]C[##### i thought this was a good play.
--
Yes, though white is now quite heavy there so in terms of building a moyo it may mean white can damage the lower group a little.]

(;W[mm]C[--
I prefer N5 forcing m4, the 4d disagreed.

N7 feels like odd shape to me.];B[lm];W[ln]
(;B[mn]
(;W[mo];B[nm];W[lp];B[lq]
(;W[oo]C[#### i played here for two reasons.  First, I didn't like the peep at P6 and then isolating these stones by black playing q6.  Second, i thought this gave me some good aji at p3.  would L4 have been better to play first?
--
I don't like P5 at all.  Let's look at L4 and L3 instead.];B[kn]
;W[lo];B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[jn];B[jm]C[--
From a shape perspective I want to see white J6 building the left moyo.]
;W[om];B[oj]C[(4d) W not left with many nice shape options for moving out around j5.  I think k5 may be the best of them.]

(;W[nc]C[##### I felt like I should play in bottom right again and take care of my weak group, but I also thought I could make an eye in the corner and then maybe another one beginning with r7.  in retrospect, i think a black play at r4 would have been really bad for me.  was o17 right, or should i have played somewhere else?  if i was going to play in the bottom right to make life, where would have been the correct place to play?
--
I think it would be better to add another stone in the LR, probably at R4 since it is sente (your p3 move), although H3 is tempting too.  (But fatal to white!)

W looks to have reasonable chances of life if b cuts off his escape route at k5.  Ive explored a few of the many options(!) so w's decision to tenuki seems a resonable gamble.]

(;B[jd]
(;W[qc]C[######  i considered playing R14, but was actually concerned that black might play r17, leaving the R14 stone really lonely.  Was R17 the best play here?  I also considered O15, but it seemed that black would be thrilled to play Q14.
--
I like R17, though R14 also seems ok.  You can also consider Q18 and simply living on the side.

(4d) r14 seems like an overplay to me.  Bs pincer at k16 might be better at l16 or m17 to force w into the corner. Its hard for b to block at r16 now becos k16 too far away to block w access to the centre.  I like o15 for w!  B must get something & isolating the k16 stone seems good for w.]
;B[pc]C[##### this seems like it was the wrong direction for black.  Is that correct?
--
Actually, I'm not convinced.  The R16 direction leads to black having a quite small territory between the 16'th row and the P10/R11 diagonal, fairly easily reduced by white and white has sente.

The Q17 direction gives black sente after ignoring R14, which gives black a nice approach on D17 or (more likely) a resumption of the attack on the lower right.  Perhaps with something simple like G5 or R4.]

--
I would have added another move to R14 first since black R13 clamps that down tightly and there are no other invasion points.

After that I would have played K14.];B[kc];W[ic];B[id]C[###### was this an overplay?  It seems that L16 would have been better.

Yes, G18 or even J18 is more normal.];W[lc];B[kd];W[ld]C[--

;B[le];W[mb];B[me];W[hd]
(;B[ge]C[--
This surprises me. I would have sacrificed G17 as black

(4d I dont think that would have been a good idea!  B has so much potential after G18.  I think W's cut was an overplay.)]

;B[fg];W[hg]C[##### this was a huge mistake on my part.  I thought this made L15 work, but i didn't read the ladder out completely.  H12 would have been much better than H13.  Or maybe even K14.

yes];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[gh]C[--

;B[jg];W[hj];B[gi];W[jh];B[kg]C[##### this seems slow for b.  is there a move that would have been better?
--
I like L13.  Black wishes to leave no bad aji on this side so that the attack can resume from the other direction.  If black attacks more severely (e.g. H11) then white can turn the tables with a move like K14.]
;W[ik];B[in];W[fk]C[##### i played here hoping that b would respond to protect the upper left group which would let me make life for my lower right group.]
