AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jj]C[In high handicap games, W should try to build some influence instead of taking too solid territory too early.   With invading at 3-3 much too early and with playing low corner approaches, W goes for territory and naturally falls behind soon, since the B hanidcap stones work perfectly with the influence B gains with W invading.



I hope, my comments help you to spot your faults and give you a general idea about how to play in high handicap games.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[no]C[In even games it would be normal to enter the corner at 3-3. However, since this is a handicap game, it is important to gain influence as W, which could not be accomplished by normal play.]
;B[pn];W[gp]LB[kp:a][ql:b][pl:c]C[This move seems to be too far away from the B pincer stone, as B can extend from it while pincering the W stone. A is joseki, b and c seem ok too, trying to provoke an early fight, something W should always try.]
;B[ip]C[Strong reply by B.];W[cc]C[Very bad because of several reasons:

(1) This move leaves two weak groups on the bottom, which is bad in itself.

(2) It lets B build magnificent influence, which works perfectly with his other handicap sontes.

(3) It is against W most important objective, building influence himself.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[db];B[eb];W[ca]C[Better to connect solidly at a. This move leaves bad aji (potential) in the corner.]
;B[fc];W[kc]LB[bf:a]C[Has to be at a, since a black move there threatens to kill W and completes his perfect shape on the outside.]
;B[bf];W[ad]LB[bb:a]C[No, the best move seems to be at a, securing W life.]
;B[nc]LB[bb:a]C[B a kills the corner. However, this move attacks the W stone, using the B thickness on the left and is therefore very good in itself.]
;W[hc];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[pi]C[Overplay! Creates a 4th weak group.]
;B[pq]LB[qk:a]C[Better at a.];W[ql]C[Good.];B[qn];W[qf];B[qe]
;W[pf];B[ol];W[pl]C[It is much more important to save the W group on the BR and try to reduce the large B moyo on the left side.]
;B[dk]C[W seems to have lost now.];W[cq]LB[lo:a][dn:b]C[Hm, this move solidifies the B moyo to territory and gains little for W. W is far behind and should try to strengthen his group on the LR with a and pincer the B corner stone with b afterwards.]
;B[cp];W[er];B[ge];W[gd]C[Bad. As a basic rule, don't push into a knight's move if you don't want to cut immedatly since it eliminates a cutting point and thus strengthens B.]
;B[fd];W[he];B[gf];W[ep]LB[gn:a]C[Hm, now there are more drastic measures needed. With a, W can aim either at attacking the B group on the lower side or at reducting B territory on the left.]
;B[eo];W[fo];B[en];W[io];B[hr];W[hq]LB[jp:a]C[Bad. Better at a? Connect your groups...]
;B[iq];W[gr];B[jo];W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[mn]C[W is very lucky here! Of course B should have cut!]

Can be cut. W should first play the sente moves at a, b, c and d.]
