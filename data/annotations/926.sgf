(;B[mc]SQ[cb]C[Teemu: Was this a good choice for joseki?
yes it was, as it utilizes the black ponnuki. notice that Black 
must ty to get sente to play at the important marked point in 
the corner to rob the white stones off there base. Maybe 
black should even play here immediately !?];W[qc];B[pc];W[pd]
;B[oc];W[qe]SQ[nc]C[this is wrong. The joseki continues with white at the marked 
point.];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[pb]
;W[of];B[md]C[Teemu: After this I thought, that this was good for black. 
I got the corner and a wall facing my ponnuki.
indeed, white has already a lost position. This is caused by 
his bad moves 12 and 18. ];W[pj];B[nq]SQ[cb]C[black has just to play at the urgent point in the other corner 
to attack white as already shown. Look up for weak groups of 
your opponent! By attacking them you can often get an 
advantage.];W[np]C[good];B[mp]C[Teemu: Had some other joseki been better choice for black?
I think this joseki is quite straight-way. I think black should 
have not approached the corner and better attack the upper 
group.];W[no];B[oq];W[pq];B[mo];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[iq]
C[Teemu: Here I thought that white should have defended his 
cutting points,
or at least play N8, but I could not figure out any good way to 
proceed.
Is there anything to aim near R6 or P5? This corner was not 
good for black?
The white move is very bad as it has two defects.
First of all the white stone has no chance of getting a 
comfotable at the black-dominated lower edge. Black can 
attck this stone quite nicely (see variation).
Second, as you recognized already, it leaves a lot of aji (bad 
potential) in the corner/the side. I think there is no absolut 
direct way for black to play there but this aji would help him 
later on quite a lot in invading the white moyo, as white has 
to worry about his defects then (see also demo-variation).]

(;B[lq]C[bad, as white gets now a secure base on the side.]
;W[fq]C[good];B[eq]C[Teemu: Is this correct now, when white J3 is so near and I 
have thickness
on right side?
you should have used your thickness one move earlier. As 
white was able to make a three space extension he is 
already settled.];W[fp];B[dn];W[io]C[good];B[ml];W[om];B[ee]
SQ[cb]C[the urgent point for both players is the marked one. When 
white now plays there, he gets nice corner territory and is out 
of danger.];W[df]
(;B[er]C[Teemu: How urgent is this?
I think this is a very big move, but it is not urgent, as the 
white stones are still not very strong so white can not invade 
the 3-3 point (see variation).];W[mr];B[mq];W[pr];B[ef];W[dg]

;W[jr];B[ll];W[mi];B[cb]C[now this is only big, while earlier in the game this was also 
an attack on the white stones. Can you see this difference?]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[ko]C[Teemu: Here I thought, that black should have attacked 
white's J3 group
much earlier in sente to make my M6 group stronger, right?
absolutely right. as I already told you you should have 
attacked white immediately when he plays J3.
There is no reason to be affraid when white drops a stone 
into your moyo as J3. You should instead be happy of such 
a nice target to attack.
Now it nearly looks as white is attacking black...];B[lo];W[ki]
C[Teemu: Now I get in trouble and white prepares to invade my top moyo.]
;B[kp];W[jp];B[jn];W[jo];B[kq]C[quite a pitty for black to have secure an eye but it seems to 
be necessary.];W[ls]C[as black has just secured an eye, there is no way for white to 
attack this group.];B[jk];W[hm];B[kn];W[jj];B[kk];W[jf];B[jd]
;W[lf];B[ie];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi];B[ok];W[pk];B[op]C[Teemu: I had a feeling that black should have something nasty in this corner,

;W[hn];B[nj];W[ni];B[qn]C[Teemu: These black stones appeared to be quite useful in the end (probably
because of white's mistake), but I guess black does not have any dangerous
options in this corner, right?];W[ro];B[rn];W[ql];B[bd];W[cd]

C[Teemu: I guess white is leading after this. Unless there is 
really something possible
in the lower right corner for black.
ther is nothing for black in the lower right, but I think the 
game would have been very close when black played as in 
the variation.]
