AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[I narrowly lost this game.  In retrospect I recognize several tactical mistakes big and small near the end of the game.  I'm most interested though in any suggestions as to how I should have controlled space more effeciently throughout the game, especially preventing white's big encroachment in the center.  Any comments are welcome.  Thanks!

You can also just stretch to one side, attach underneath or play tenuki]

(;B[hf]C[Here I was afraid that H15 would leave too many cutting points.  In retrospect that doesn't make much sense, since this creates even more.

;W[ci];B[dj]C[> this is a reducing move against moyos, this white group is no moy so this move is not good, it will make white stronger. Attacking r14 or the white's invasion at f17 are better]

;W[bl];B[bm];W[gm];B[en];W[dk]C[This cut shows black's last two moves were an overplay.  But what would have been the more appropriate correction - C7 instead of B7, or E7 instead of E6?

Try not to play moves that make your opponent stronger without giving you a decent gain (either in territory or influence)
