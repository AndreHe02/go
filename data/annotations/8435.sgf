C[Hello, I am Chris Dams and I will be your reviewer today.

First some general remarks.

In the fuseki both of you seem to like the kind of diagonal extension that I show in the variation of this first move. However, that extension is
quite weak as the opponent can play in the middle of it. Leaving holes that the oppenent can run through is generally a bad idea.

Also, in the end game you play some really timid moves where you could actually have made moves that make points. Especially when it is close
you really should not be doing that.

(-- I am Cenair983 [White\] on KGS. I have reviewed this game and have included my post-game comments surrounded in (--- ---).

I'll try to label any variations I put in as well as ask questions. Do not feel obligated to answer them, though you are welcome to. I expect that there are key concepts I missed and poor moves I played that are not touched upon the questions, so feel free to give additional comments.

Some abbreviations:
    Bl - Black, referring to the black player
    Wh - White, referring to the white player
    Bl# refers to move #, made by the Black Player (like Bl35)
    Wh# refers to move #, made by the White player (like Wh26)

Thank you kindly for your review!

;W[pd];B[pj];W[ph]C[Uh uh. Difficult question. I am not a pro, you know ;-). Seriously, games are not won or lost over moves in the fuseki. I think it is best to play what you are
comfortable with and what you like. You might consider placing this white stone on R12 instead. In the game, after you pincer black Q10, Black does quite
some damage, but with a white stone on R12, decending to S10 becomes less attractive to Black.

(--- With this move I let black have all three left side star points. Was this a mistake? If not, was my play Wh6 reasonable? ---)]
;B[dj];W[pl]C[Again, R8 was a possibility. It is not a problem if one of these pincering stones is high, but if both are high, S10 does quite some damage.
Also R8 threatens to cross underneath on R10.

(--- I did not expect black to ignore me here, so I took most of the left side, forcing Black to run (which I was happy he did). ---)]
;B[rj];W[rh]LB[nj:A][rl:B]C[You might also consider White R11 instead. If you are lucky, Black answers on R10 and you got your move protecting the upper right for free.

I also added some comments in your variation.

Variations:

A - Actual Game
B - What I thought might be a better move for black and some of my responses

---)]
(;B[nj];W[nh];B[jj]C[This is a rather strange move by Black. It leaves a big hole between K10 and O10. Playing on M10 seems a good idea.]
;W[fq];B[fn]LB[dn:B][go:A]C[So many strange moves..... Your poor reviewer is terribly confused now. What I know for certain though is that your suggested move B is not good.
Black should play E5 after B and then the stone on D6 is just weak and cut off and F3 might end up weak as well if you do not do something about.
I guess your move A is okay. I might have played J4 while waiting for an opportunity to play E5. These two black stones have a big hole in between
them and running through holes is a nice activity with lots of profit.

(--- What is a good response to this move?

Variations:

A - Actual game play
B - Attempt to invade ---)]
(;W[go];B[lj];W[rl]C[This would also have been a good time to play K16 and prevent Black from playing there.]
;B[jd];W[cc]TR[dd][dj][jd]C[Yes, invading on 3-3 is good here. If Black were to close the corner at D17 or C16, he is bound to get lots of territory in that neighbourhood.

(--- Was this a good time for a 3-3 invasion? I've thought that once I let black get a double-wing (see marked stones) I should invade the corner ---)]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[bc]LB[bb:A][ec:C][ed:B]C[The move in the actual game is fine. Since Black had better answer, you are getting C for free after it, so no need to play it immediately. As you found
out yourself, you are too weak in the area to play B.

Variations:

A - Actual Game
B - An aggressive attempt that seems to fail

---)]
(;W[bb];B[bd];W[ec];B[ab]C[This is not a good move by Black. You can play H17. The profit you make on the outside is larger than what Black makes by capturing your stone. Note
that it is also not the case that Black is gaining stability if he were to capture your white stone on B18. He is already stable enough, so capturing this
stone is just a few points in the corner. Not  worth it. If he captures the stone, it is gote too, so you get to do another move somewhere else, making
profit.];W[ba];B[ee];W[gd]C[H17 leads to solid territory and your White group will probably not come into danger anymore. In the game you play J17 to make sure your group is safe
but then you have done two moves for this purpose. That is a bit much.]
;B[fg];W[ic]C[If you had done H17 instead, you could chase the black stone by playing M17 instead, making sure that you get territory in the upper right, though
maybe not all of what you outlined with the white stones.];B[jc]
;W[id];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[ie]C[Preventing Black from getting a base on the upper side is more urgent. Play e.g., O17 instead.]
;B[ff]C[Bad move for Black. This is very small. The big move for Black would have been O17 getting a base for his stones at the upper side. Now you get the
opportunity to play there and create some nice territory for yourself while forcing your oppenent to run for safety.]
;W[nc];B[ke];W[jg];B[mf];W[nf];B[mh];W[mg];B[lg];W[ng];B[lf]
;W[jo]C[The cut on M12 is too attractive to let go off.];B[li]
;W[nl];B[qq];W[qp]C[This seems to be the wrong direction. The wall that you can expect to get in this joseki is too close to the O8-Q8-S8 group if it faces upwards but
at the right distance if it faces the stone on K5.];B[pq];W[oq]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[rq]C[Strange move. The joseki has S4 instead. That takes a little bit more territory from White at no cost.]
;W[rp];B[sq];W[oo]C[This move is not useful. If Black plays on P4 you can capture him anyway. If you want to make sure that P4 does not cause any danger, play N2
instead.];B[qr]C[Does not seem useful either. Blacks corner is not in danger. If Black is doubting that more safety can be acquired by playing N2 and that move
at least comes with some profit.];W[mr];B[ns];W[ll];B[cq];W[gn]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[hl];W[jl]C[This should have been on J8. It is a pushing battle, so you need to keep pushing. Black would need some kind of defense after J8.]
;B[fl];W[im];B[ik]LB[io:A][ss:B]C[(--- I am testing to see if Wh78 is necessary.

Variations:

A - Connecting at W78
B - White plays elsewhere (see its variations for how to fight the connection). Note: this is not where I would play if I played elswhere. I just wanted to select a neutral point

From variations I conclude that the connection is probably unecessary but leads to complicated playing. Since the game is close (though I have the advantage) I probably cannot afford to avoid a complex fight.

Score estimate:

Black:
   7 points in lower right corner
   60 points at left side

White:
   40 points in lower side/lower center
   6 points at top side
   25 points at left (though corner is unsecured, thus I secure it soon)
---)]
(;W[io]C[As you find out if your variation White actually had nothing to fear. But even if he had it is better to look for moves that also make some points and
threaten something instead of being purely defensive. F5 for instance, strengthens you and Black needs to answer it.]
;B[ih];W[ig];B[hg];W[hf];B[gh];W[jh];B[ii]
(;W[qc]C[As shown in the variation, Black can still mess it up by creating a ko. On the other hand, if the ko does not work for him he does not have
anything in the corner. I personally would be inclined to go grab some points somewhere instead. Sometimes I regret that attitude ;-).
