(;B[ql]C[This move is too close to black's strong wall. Ideally, black wants white to invade at this point, so black can build a strong wall at the 10th line, building a strong moyo at the top half of the board. White can't live easily, so black will gain a lot. The proverb says: "play away from strength."]

Sometimes unnecessary moves were played, so always think: is this move really necessary ? Does life and death of groups depend on it ? Is it making a framework or taking territory ? If this is not the case, take sente ! Surprise your opponent by sacrificing some stones, and taking large points in other places.
Fighting spirit is clearly not lacking in any of the two players, that's certainly a positive point. Now you should just learn which fights are worth fighting.]
