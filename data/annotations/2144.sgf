C[On playing through this game I've seen various small errors, particularly in the latter half of the game.

However I don't think these were the reason for the loss. I have a vague feeling that there is something in my style of play which is wrong. Perhaps too passive, perhaps too moyo focussed, perhaps errors of timing.

Because I don't know what is going wrong I do not have questions at any specific move. Instead I'd be interested in overrall comments about strategic choices, places where you would choose a completely different line of play.]
;B[pd];W[po];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[dj];B[pj];W[ql];B[jq]C[This might be a little bit slow - I would rather play at Q3. But this warikomi should be ok, too.]
;W[pq];B[fq];W[eq]C[This tsuke is bad - - until now, black is doing well.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[mq]C[This is a very solid move. M3 would be very big for white and black would like too answer it - this move can't be bad, although it's a little slow.]
;W[qh];B[dg]C[Personally, I would prefer C12.];W[qf];B[nd];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[ec];B[dc]C[After the following move, D13 becomes ineffective. Maybe you should play D18 or C17 to prevent this?]
;W[ed];B[df];W[gc];B[he];W[ff];B[pg]C[Good!];W[qg];B[hg];W[db]
;B[cb];W[dd];B[cc];W[fb];B[pf]C[Good!];W[ph];B[oh];W[rc]C[Oops. White should hane at P11.]
;B[rb]C[You should definitely play at P11.];W[oi];B[nh];W[pi]
;B[pl]C[This move looks dubious. You are strengthening whites territory without getting definitive eyeshape. I would not play in this area right now - the stone still has aji, and white would not play there right now either. I would invade at C8, C3 or R4 (the latter is difficult).]
;W[pm];B[qk]C[Bad. If you want to play in this area, you should play at P8.]
;W[ol]
(;B[qm]C[Usually you should connect, but the white could break into your moyo. You cannot fight like this if you play a moyo game.]

(;W[pk]C[This is too mild. You would not live so easy if white plays the sagari at S8.]

;B[rm];W[hb];B[ib];W[er]C[Big, but the game is still good for black.]
;B[fr]C[To slow! White F2 should be gote. You should definitely invade at C8 now!]
;W[mj]C[Slow. White should just play at D8.];B[lh];W[ih]
(;B[jg]C[This leaves bad aji at J14. If you want to defend, push at J13]

C[I don't see why you can't block at K19.];W[ja];B[ka];W[ha]
;B[kb];W[ca];B[cl]C[Invading here after C19 is dangerous. Actually, this might be the loosing move, as your upper left corner barely lives (white could actually have killed it!).]
;W[cn]C[White should play at C10 to keep you separated.];B[cj]
;W[ci]
(;B[dk]C[The crosscut at D11 looks like the only move here, although white could live then. Now your group becomes heavy and your corner gets weak.]
;W[bj];B[ck];W[di];B[fk];W[ce];B[be];W[bb];B[de]
