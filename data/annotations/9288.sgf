AB[pd][dp]C[Thanks for the review! :)
I'm playing black with a 2 stone handicap, as you can see.


Hey. My name is David, i'm about 3kyu on KGS. 
My english may be not so good, sorry about that.
My comments will begin by D:

(;B[cf]LB[ch:A][dh:B][ci:C]C[I think this move might have been a bit too premature because there's not a huge amount of space to establish a base?

D: 
F4 is a must with this sequence. It's the normal end of the joseki, and, with this excellent shape, you become very strong at the south, which is your bigger side for now
See the discussion here : http://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointLowApproachTsukenobiPushIntoCorner

The push of white in D5, followed by the cut in E4 is hard to deal with

Concerning your move, it's playable, I think, but perhaps not so good because white is very happy to make a pincer at A, B or C. The pincer of white is a good extension of his C5 group]

(;W[fc]C[D: white doesn't play the pincer, good for you]
(;B[bd]C[D: i would nor have played this move. No more invasion in san san possible, and you give too much power to white in the top.]
;W[cc];B[ci];W[do]
(;B[ep]C[I decided to sacrifice the stones at D6 and D7. Lots of territory from the 4th line.

D : ouch. Very bad shape. White goes through a tobi, that's terrible for black. You really should add a move at F4 to avoid troubles. If you havent, i would block anyway and fight.]
;W[eo];B[fp];W[fo]
(;B[go]C[I think in hindsight this move was a bit greedy. I wasn't expecting a cut.

;W[gp]
(;B[ho]C[D : agressive and good move. The meaning is : "you have overplayed. I will kill you."

D : mmh, that's a bit slow. White is very happy to play L3 next move, and get a base of life.]
;W[kq]
(;B[pk]C[D : excellent move. That's a big point

You could have play R4 too];W[qq]C[I didn't mind this invasion as it helped me secure the right hand side.

D : yes, you'res right.];B[qp];W[pq]
(;B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[gn]C[D : useless move of white.]

(;B[mn]C[I think I should have played something like Q12 here?

D : your move is slow yes, and not urgent. 
Time to have a global look.
Ask yourself : 
1/ Have you weak groups on the board ? (no)
2/ Have your opponent weak groups ? 
Yes : J2 group is not alive yet. You can consider the attack of this group

- you can think to invade at H3 too, before white play H16

- If you really want to begin a moyo, you can O9 too. But you have to be prepared to the invasion in R12.]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[qh]LB[pg:A][qj:B]C[D : your top group is in (relative) danger. To be confortable, you can begin the sequence by R18.
If you want to play more agressive and attack the stone immediatly, consider A or B]

(;B[ph]C[D : This is a mistake. Tsuke (contact) is useful for defense, not for attack. You make white stronger that way.]
;W[pi];B[pg];W[qj]
(;B[qk];W[oi];B[ri]C[D: no, too soon for that. White will escape in the center.]

(;W[qi]C[D : white souldn't answer here. H16 is much bigger]
;B[rj]C[D : idem, too small];W[nh]
(;B[ln]C[D : why do you give up your attack ? R12 group is still the weaker group.]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jn];B[mk];W[nf]C[D: here, you must have an HUGE alarm in your head ! White is enclosing you and making a big influence in the center, begining a moyo]

(;B[of];W[mg];B[qb];W[ef]C[D : aie aie aie. White is getting a big moyo]

C[D : ouch.]
(;B[ki]C[I knew this move was a mistake as soon as I'd made it. :(

D : not so bad, this is the direction of white moyo, but this is too late, white has a huge territory in the north.
You are late now, minimum 20 points. The game is almost over.]

D : it was a pleasure.

To synthetise the game, i would say that you have not made big mistakes in the game. 
But...

You lose this game, because you let white create a huge moyo and turning it into territory without even eroding it. I have pointed out the white moves where you have to react immediately.

To improve your style, I think that you should pay more attention to the shapes you play. If your opponent get through your tobi or keima, that's seem bad. Study too the hane in the head of two stones.

Besides, try to be coherent with your choices. If you decide to sacrifice stones to make territory, go until the end, and make territory. Dont start a fight in the middle of the sequence. 
If you attack a ennemy group, do it until the group is safe or dead (or you can stop an attack to protect one of your groups)  

You can try to play a bit more agressive too. Perhaps you are a little bit scared in invading ennemy territories. To make progress, you will have to try it. You will fail in invade 9 times, but you will suceed the 10th.

I hope this was helpful for you. You can send me mails if you have further questions. I play on KGS as David925
