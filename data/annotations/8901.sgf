C[This is a league game. I am mostly interested in hints for opening and invasions later on. If you have some comments for the opponent side (although I think he was much stronger in joseki), I would aprreciate too.

I changed nicknames to 'me' and 'opponent' since I don't know if the opponent wants to have his game publicly commented ;)
My opponnent is 7k, and me 8-7k on KGS.

Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS, your reviewer. :-)

Let's have fun together.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]
(;W[cd]C[W: This is said to be a "bad" move for White, because Black has an ideal approach.]
(;B[ec];W[df];B[hd];W[jp]C[I don't feel confident in Joseki. With players of similar strength, I usually get worse position in the start. Of course I can check some joseki sequences after the game, but it helps only locally, and in such situations like here I don't really now where to play. I just select some nice looking random move ;)]

W: Try to draw an imaginary line. (In this case mine is not straight, but imagine a straight line x))

If it's inside opponents line it's too aggressive, and might get captured. (A)
If it's on the line it's in balance with attack and defense. (B)

TR[ln]SQ[ko]C[Could this fight be better played? Could G6 be used?

W: Fighting is all about liberties.

Earlier, you played M6 so Black's group near G6 has 5 liberties. If you had played L5 instead, the group near G6 would have only 4 liberties. The less liberties a group has, the more likely it is to be involved in some sort of a tesuji or even capture. For now, it seems unlikely that G6 can be used.]
