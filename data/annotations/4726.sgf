C[Hello! I'm Kamtre, and this is my first reveiw, heh heh. I'll try my best to help you improve your game. If you have any questions about terms used, Sensei's Library ( Senseis.xmp something) has all (as far as I know) Go terms used, both from english and other languages. I don't know the address off by heart, but it's a partner site to the GTL, and you can find a link on the GTL Homepage.

I'll try the best I can, but if you have any questions, e-mail me at Kamtre@gmail.com
BTW I got tired of always typing variation, so I shortened it to Var.

Kamtre];B[pd]
(;W[pp];B[dp];W[dc];B[jc]LB[jc:A][fd:C][ce:B]C[Usually you wouldn't do A unless your board looks like this (see start Var.) instead of this move, you might play B or C, which both limit white's influence to the corner. B would keep him in the corner, while C would give you big territory . My pick would probably be B.]
;W[ic]C[Bad move for white, usually in this Position, hane isn't a good idea. , for the reson of your move 7]
;B[id];W[hc];B[jb]LB[jb:B][hd:A]C[Usually you would extend to A, to limit W's territory in the corner.  B was a good move, but not this early in the game, something similar would usually be only used in endgame.]
;W[hd]
(;B[je]C[This is usually a bad move (see variation)];W[ie];B[jd]
;W[ck]LB[ck:A][cn:C][dn:D][dp:B]C[With A, white can now fight a backed-up fight against your B stone, because A provides support later on for an attack at C.]
;B[qk]LB[qk:A][fp:E][gp:B][fq:D][gq:C]C[This move creates some territory, though however unstable.
The most profitable move is probably  B, C, D and, RARELY E. 
There are many Go proverbs on SL (sensei's library) and they help alot with improving gameplay. The one that applies here is, roughly "Play the urgent move before the big move"]
;W[qj]LB[qh:C][pi:B][qi:D][qk:A]C[here, A becomes an obstacle to you. You can let it survive, or make acceptable losses.  B is a good alternative, D and C not so much.  The objectice now is to keep it from taking too much territory, because the chances of killing it are very small. See Vars.]

(;B[pj];W[qi];B[ok]LB[ph:A]C[Useless move, for the most part.  A would probably be much better.]
;W[rk]LB[pf:F][qf:D][pg:E][qg:B][rg:C][ph:A]C[I can't help it, but white should've gone to ANY of these moves. "Keeping up your momentum is better than popping your vehicle into reverse while moving."
Remember to learn from your opponent's mistakes too.];B[rl]
LB[pg:B][qg:A]C[you can't forget the imminent threat on your Q16 stone, and it's territory. once again, try blocking it, you've lost territory, but it's not too late to retain some. B and A are both good]
;W[ql];B[pk];W[rm];B[rj];W[sl];B[pi];W[qh];B[qg]LB[ph:A]C[A would've been better, though it leaves R13 open, it is better than leaving an open peep like this because it means great loss, as experienced later.]
;W[ph];B[pg]LB[oh:A]C[A would've helped partially block him from spreading even more.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[rg];B[nf];W[og]
(;B[qf]LB[of:A][qf:B]C[B is more or less useless, Peeps like A are Much higher priority than B. At least playing A would protect  B from  Immediate threat because of an eye that is 3/4 formed. See move 36 Var.]
;W[rf]LB[of:A];B[re];W[pf];B[qe];W[of];B[sf]LB[oe:A]C[Peeps mean death.]

;W[jh];B[ib]LB[ib:A][ki:B][lj:C][pm:F][cn:E][on:G][gp:D]C[A is also an endgame move, it only changes territory minutely, and there are bigger, better moves like B-G]

[is]C[You played well for a beginner, but like all beginners, you made mistakes, your opponent wasn't without them, either.

     Don't let my criticisms make you discouraged, because I was a worse player than you when I began. I made many countless mistakes, but I learned from them, which is the key.
      "The fool makes mistakes and doesn't learn from them, But the wise-man never makes the same mistake twice" (loosley quoted from Proverbs, in the Bible)

Your mistakes during the upper-right cost you the game, but a lesson learned is well worth the loss.

Hope you learned alot from this reveiw, because I actually learned some attacking strategies, so I should thank you as much as you thank me. I could pick out problems in your game, because they were clearly made, but when you send your next reveiw, Remember to add your own comments and questions, because otherwise the reveiwer might not address your questions and flaws because they don't know what you want to know.

Thanks for sending the game in, I enjoyed reveiwing it.

Kamtre 

(also, please reccommend me to people you play, I've been on the GTL for a few months, and you're the first reveiw I've gotten. Thanks Again.)]
