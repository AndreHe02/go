CEG - purpose of move was to prevent B from making ideal extension  from corner enclosure

N - I would play the standard approach at A instead.  You're a little close to B's strength.]
;B[ql]C[N - This move takes advantage of your move.];W[qf]C[
CEG - Also considered two-point extension, but that seemed a little  cramped and didn't put any pressure on upper right corner...possible  downside was B's opportunity to invade...comments?

N - It's a reasonable follow-up];B[qe]LB[qd:a]C[
CEG - Doesn't B's move unnecessarily strengthen W's shape?

N - Yes, exactly.  He should play A.];W[pf]C[
CEG - I also considered the hane, but didn't want to start a fight  near B's strength, and also considered a one-point jump from the R-11  stone...but decided that this was a good opportunity to strengthen  the W shape and threaten Q-15.

N - Yes];B[pe];W[oj];B[ol];W[jp]C[
CEG - Purpose was to mitigate influence of B's strong presence in  lower right;  also a good extension from D-4.

N - Sure];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[dj]C[
CEG - I also considered invading the top instead, but this seemed  like a good move as well.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[fe];W[jj]C[
CEG - Difficult to explain this one, and there were lots of other  good moves to make as well, such as playing closer to the upper side  or enclosing the lower left corner.  But this seemed interesting.

N - I agree.  It facilitates a possible invasion of the top while building a moyo.  You are a little behind in territory and need to make things interesting.]
;B[fj];W[jf]LB[dl:a]C[
CEG - Another difficult decision about how to react to B's previous  move.  Suggestions?  I wanted to make some sort of play against the  upper side, finally, and this or plays a little to the right seemed  to also serve the purpose of securing more influence in the  center-right.

N - B's move is a sente move which gains him little.  Just play A.]
;B[dk];W[le]C[
CEG - I chose tenuki against B's left side play...reasonable?

N - No.  You are abandoning your strategy of building influence in the lower right quadrant.]
;B[cq]C[N - This is a poor move which revitalizes your center influence.  A "thank-you" move.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[dr];W[er];B[bn];W[cm];B[cr]
;W[eq];B[cj];W[oe]LB[lc:a][mq:b][lq:c][di:d]TR[dk][fj]C[
CEG - Another tenuki...my thinking is that B isn't going to get a  whole lot of territory on the left, and now is a good opportunity to  play again on the top.  In retrospect, strengthening the bottom was  probably a superior option.    N - Your stone is weak; never attach to strong stones.  A is a much better reduction, and B or C would build territory on a large scale while defending your position.  But I think D is your best move, because it weakens the black stones (which were already weakened by his invasion of the corner)  and creates various potentials for a fight.  If you can cut off the triangled stones you can get a large center territory.]
;B[re];W[rf]C[N - How may points is this move worth?  Ten?  It's an endgame move.  A, B, C, and D above are each worth at least twenty.]
;B[od];W[ne];B[di];W[cb]LB[lc:a]C[
CEG - Another tenuki on the side!  B seems to have invested four  moves to one on the left side.  He now has some territory and decent  influence there...was I wrong to let him play so many times without  an answer?  C-18 seemed like good security for my corner (which  wasn't perhaps in that much danger) plus it allowed a good endgame  clamp on D-18.

N - Now that you have let him strengthen himself on the right side, it's not a bad idea.]
;B[io]LB[lc:a]C[N - B mised the boat.  This move got him in big trouble.  He should just play A and solidify his lead for an easy win.  He's invading as if he was behind.  Shows the value of counting!]
;W[jo]C[
CEG - Important move for W.  I could have played underneath, but that  seemed too passive.  K-5 might allow sufficient strength to invade  the lower right.  Too ambitious?  I also considered playing above and  to the left of the invading B stone...any opportunities there?

N - Good move.];B[go];W[fm]C[N - Right direction, good.];B[en]
C[N - This move weakens his stones terribly and does not create a cutting point as he seems to have intended.]
;W[em];B[hq];W[in];B[hn];W[ip];B[ho];W[hp];B[gp];W[gq];B[fq]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[fs];B[fp]C[
CEG - This move by B seemed to make the game difficult for him.  The  ensuing fight turned out poorly for him, and the result was a great  deal of W profit and influence.  Seems that he could have played it  differently and gotten a very good result.  Any moves in the fight  from here on that either player should have done differently?

N - B has already destroyed his game.];W[im];B[fn];W[dn];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[eo];B[hl];W[gk];B[hk];W[hj];B[gj];W[fl];B[dl]
;W[fo];B[gn]LB[lc:a]C[
CEG - Should B have omitted this move and tried to escape at the top  J-11, etc.)?  Still probably difficult for him, but now I believe  he's dead.

I'm happy for you to ignore the rest of the game...not as interesting  and I played pretty passively at times knowing that I had the  advantage.  Comments appreciated as you wish, though.  Thanks!

N - All I've got to say is that both of you should have been looking for a chance to play A.  Good game!]
