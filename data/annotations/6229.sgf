C[Dear Reviewer -
Thank you helping me on this one.
I am bouncing between 4K and 2K recently - may be your advice will help to 'break the wall'. So my expectation is to get general advices about what I do wrong and how to improve.

In this game I played White and lost by 6.5 points.

Thanks again!
Avi

I was asked by the Teaching Ladder to review both sides, however, I will put more focus on your moves.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[qf];W[ed];B[ec]LB[hd:A]C[Although it may be more of an element of style, it's natural for black to pincer at A, which goes well with his upper right stones.]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[cc];W[fd];B[be]LB[gc:A][cf:C][df:B]C[It' too early to play the game move.  Black should jump out to A.  Normally white will play B next and black gains sente.  If white skips B and plays elsewhere, black can clamp at C later.  The game move takes away this aji.]
;W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[gc]
(;W[gd]C[[A\] Is it good to  push like this in such positions?

Absolutely, otherwise, black puhsing here is too good for him.  Please see variation.]
;B[hc]C[[A\] Should White push once more here?];W[bg]LB[jp:A]
C[[A\] So far I feel good as White, do you agree?

The corner outcome is good for white, as black crawls on the second line.  However, it is too early to play the game move.  Play A to form a framework at the bottom.]
;B[qn];W[np];B[cn];W[cl];B[dl];W[dm]LB[dk:A]C[[A\] I considered other options as too submissive. The result was that Black got the corner, but I still do not see a better continuation for White, do you?

Normally white plays A, but that looks overlapped in this case.]

;B[hd]LB[fo:A]C[The lower left hasn't settled yet.  Black needs to play A to prevent white from sealing him in.]
;W[fo];B[bq];W[br];B[ar];W[cr]LB[ap:B][aq:A]C[Throw in at A to reduce black's eye space.  Black has to capture at B.]
;B[bl];W[bk];B[am]
(;W[en]C[[A\] Looking now at this move, it does not feel right. What do you say?

Tenuki.  Don't worry about black coming out.  Please see variations.]
;B[fn]C[Black shouldn't cut.  This cutting stone becomes a target.]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[ho];B[hf];W[dk]LB[gg:A][hg:B]C[A is better.  If black pushes at B, then tenuki.  The ladder still works for white.]
;B[dn];W[em]TR[fm][fn][gn][ho]C[[A\] I could let Black capture here - the ko is too big for White... - but:

The game move is good.  Look at it this way.  Black plays two moves with his marked stones in exchange of two moves with white.  Clearly this exchange is very bad for black.  One can argue that these moves cause black more than 10 points.]
;B[pj]C[[A\] It gives Black the opportunity to take this big point.]

(;W[oe]LB[kc:D][nc:A][qc:C][qd:B]C[[A\] Looking at what starts to be a big Black moyo, I decided to invade. Is it the correct approach?

There are many ways to reduce or invade black's framework.  White can play B to live in the corner, but the resultant thickness is too good for black.  Play A with a follow up move either at C or D.  Please see variation.]
;B[pd];W[og];B[ph]LB[oh:B][qh:A]C[Although this move allows black to make more territory, white can play push at B in sente.  When attacking, it is important not to allow your opponent to find sente moves to finesse.  A is better.]

(;W[ie];B[he]C[This peep takes away aji.  Please see variation.]
;W[le];B[md];W[ld];B[mc];W[lc]LB[mf:A]C[[A\] This enables Black to split White. Is N15 better?

This is an overplay .  A gets out to center a bit faster.];B[me]
;W[mf];B[lf];W[mg];B[kf];W[mb];B[nb];W[ma];B[na]LB[oc:A]C[This is bad for black.  This allows white to make an eye in sente.  Simply defend at A.]
;W[kb];B[jd]C[[A\] This lets White live at the top:];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[oc];B[od];W[ob];B[pb];W[oa];B[li]LB[nj:D][ql:B][om:A][kp:C]
C[[A\] Now the big question: Pull out the N13 group, or give it up and use it to build take on the other side?

The group isn't completely dead and it will be expensive for black to play an extra move to kill the group.  Play A to force a response at B by black.  Then play C to take profit at the bottom.  With a stone at A, D may allow white to pull the group out.]
;W[oi]C[[A\] After a lot of thoug I decided to pull it out, because it looks too big.]
;B[oj];W[lh];B[kh];W[mi];B[lj];W[mj];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj];W[lk]
;B[ml];W[ki];B[kj];W[ji];B[lg];W[mh];B[jj];W[jg];B[kl]C[[A\] Black decides not to take chances, and let White live. I think that may be he could capture, but this way he kept the lead without risking himself.]
;W[kg];B[ii];W[je];B[jh];W[ig];B[lq]C[[A\] Black's string center give him good backup for this invasion.]
;W[on];B[rp];W[jq];B[lo]C[[A\] From this point White is having an up-hill fight, trying to close the gap - but Black wins at the end. If you find mistakes that could turn this game around I will appreciate it.
Thanks again!

You can still win the game if you play sharper yose moves.  Please see the comments for the rest of the game.]
