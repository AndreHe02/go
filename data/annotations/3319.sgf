Hello, I'm Tom (RazorBrain on IGS/KGS) My comments will be preceded by RB>>>]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dq];B[nq]C[RB>>> Typically black should approach the unbalanced corner in the lower left. C5 perhaps. There is no ruch to approach here.]
;W[qq]C[I wanted to protect the corner before expanding. Is that move correct?

RB>>> This is too slow, or conservative, especially in the opening. The corner is not sacred. If he takes it, that;s okay as long as you get something as big or bigger. I would have enclosed the left corner at C5. This is also a big move for white. The Q4 is in no immeadiate danger.]
;B[co]C[RB>>> Now black takes the missed opportunity.];W[cm]
C[Here, should try that pincer or protect byG3 maybe? If pincer is OK, maybe D7 is better?]
;B[eo];W[fq];B[go];W[dj]C[Here I thought I could always protec the group at the bottom left as it is now, but I may have been wrong, as proves the rest of the game.

If I had continued expanding along the bottom, I could have secured it and maybe reached the bottom right, but B thenwould have a big influnce on center. What's best?

RB>>> THis is okay. I like keeping your groups balanced. The white stones at the bottom feel some pressure now but are still okay at this point.]
;B[hq]
(;W[pj]C[Now I know I should have protected the corner. But I thought I'd try and see how I could do with this later on, and so decided to play a big move instead.

RB>>> This was a mistake! There is nothing biger on the board right now than your left corner. The corner is probably worth 40 points or more. see variation.]
;B[kq]C[ow maybe I should have done that before B, but i'm not sur. Maybe it's best to let him have the bottom once he started his wall and expand somewhere else? Not sure as my bottom left group is weak and this makes quite a moyo for B.

RB>>> Yes this is good for black, but O5 is a better choice. O5 is also a good move for white. But the corner has to be settled first!!!!]
;W[qm];B[qh];W[jd]C[Here: is this big move ok, or maybe i should have played to secure the bottom right from R12? Maybe a pincer on it? Or something completely different : C14?

RB>>> The lower left corner!!! Okay I think I have said that enough now :-) This is fine other than that. But I would have gone a line lower at K17.]
;B[ch];W[gd]C[Maybe I should have defended better the left side here, but this move turned out quite good after the invasion later on at C17.

RB>>> Again, you have left stones under developed. Now the two left stones are weak. K16 (k17) can respond to a black move from either side, by somply going the other way. So, C13, maybe C14 would have been better. It pressures the D16 stone and helps your left side.]
;B[df];W[mc]C[It looks like black is ahead because of this weak bottom left group. C4 now would be good, no?

RB>>> B4 as mentioned earlier. You have two weak groups. I have not seen the end of the game yet, but I suspect these will be your undoing.]
;B[oc];W[cc]
(;B[cd]C[RB>>> Wrong direction. Black should have played D17 and split white. White could have lived in the corner but the result would have been black thickness thta could have decimated whtie's holdings at the top. See variation]
;W[dc]
(;B[eh]C[RB>>> No!!!! E17!];W[ed]C[I saw the opportunity to take a good deal of territory up there. Is that move alright, or should I respond to B's E12 with F10 or something?

RB>>> THe E16 move is good! The whole move into the corner is wrong until your left side stones are safe. They must run to live. Even though it will be costly, sacrificing them will be the game!


Is Q14 a god move at the moment?

RB>>> R14 maybe, not Q14. Q14 is not deep enough. If Black closes off an R14 move you can always jump into the corner.]
;B[fj]C[Ah.. here's F10.. Now this gets dangerous.

RB>>> Already beyond dangerous.];W[ci]C[Wanted to secure the side here, instead of escamping, as there was plenty of place.

RB>>> Black can still play C9. See variation.]
(;B[ee];W[fd]C[Is F15 better? I thought about B16 but it's gote, right?

RB>>> F16 is good.];B[oh];W[no]C[I had the choice of trying to stop B from expanding.. or expanding myself on another place.

As it turns out that B invaded on the left, should I play R10, S10 or maybe R11 and start a fight there to secure the side?

RB>>> No O5 is good., as I mentioned earlier.This is a big play for both sides!]
;B[bh]C[RB>>> Too timid. Black should invade at C9 as shown in the earlier variation.]
;W[bi];B[rj];W[qk]C[I'm unsure how to respond to this.

RB>>> Perfect!!! Now if he pushes at S9 you block at S8. This works even without the R7 stone in place.]
;B[rk];W[fl]C[I guess I shouldn't have left this fight so early. Should have played S8 maybe.

RB>>> Exactly! AlsoF8 has littel or no connection to other stones and a long way to run to get back to friendly territory. This moves begs black to push through at E9. I understand that you want access to the center, but it may be too late for that now. If this stone gets severed, it has done you little good.]
;B[ek];W[dk];B[bq]C[RB>>> Finally! This is the game winning move. B$ would have won the game for you!]
;W[el]C[I thought if B cut me at E8, I would have been in trouble with that F8 stone all alone. So I decided to abandon the stones at the bottom, which I should have helped earlier. This allowed me to go to the center later and connect my groups.

RB>>> Yes it is too late for the corner stones. Black played the E9 cut but did not follow it up after you played D9.

I am still unsure, but I fell like if I am not sure I can go all the way to the center, my opponent will make a good deal of territory there. And in this situation, it looks like I will need center territory to win.

RB>>> Yes it is good for you to get into the center. But I think there is little territory to be had there for white. It is more a mission of destruction against black.]
;B[gr];W[dn]C[As I had decided to abandon those two stones, I just wanted him to believe I wanted to rescue them and we would both build a wall. Mine would help me go to the center.

RB>>>  Right. It is the energy from the threat that you will connect that is profitable for you.]
;B[do];W[fn];B[rl]C[There it doesn't work and B invades more and more the right side.]
;W[fo]C[So I decided to try the cut here and maybe rescue on or two stones and reduce B's  moyo in there.

RB>>> Yes you should push in here. Black's response at S8 has much less potential I think.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[eq]C[Now the operation s successful but is worth near zero points...

Could we say that I at least gained sente :) ?

RB>>> Not really sente really. But while you didn't save the corner, you reduced it by more than black's S8 reduce you.]
;W[gf]C[Tried to expand as well as theaten his left group

RB>>> Well there is no threat to the black group. It is alive and strong. But this is still a good move, as it builds good territory potential for you.]
;B[fr]C[Was there an interest for me to play F2?]
(;W[gh]C[Now that B let me play, I thought this was an intersting wall to build. Maybe I could connect to the left group and have a nice base for the center. I would surely reduce B's left moyo too.

RB>>> This is fine, but another thought is to threaten an invasion in the upper right and use that threat to build the other wall of a formidable moyo. See variation.]
;B[ql]C[Now this was dangerous. These two W stones are now lost and B gets a good moyo upper right of the board if I don't protect them. But how? Q8 : I don't like the shape I would get with it, as I would need a lot of stones to defend it. But at least it would have made a good moyo for me too at the bottom right.

RB>>> Yes Q8. The shape is actually quite strong (Tiger's Mouth. See variation.]

(;W[gj]C[But I decided to finish that wall I thought of. I realize now that it doesn't make territory.

Is that wall a good idea or not?

RB>>> Not unless you do somthing ont he other side, like shown in the earlier variation or somthing at least like O14. It does give white a lot of power on the left. but Q8 was still the right move.]
;B[pk]C[Ouch.

RB>>> Yes losing these was big.];W[pl]C[This is mayb to attacking, as I should know the two stones are lost already. Now Q7 or S7 look better (no wonder B played them)]
;B[pm];W[ol]C[In that situation, capturing B's stone may lead to a better situation? I thought I would prevent a ko fight.

RB>>> Well don't be scared of fight ko. But besides that this whole sequence is flawed in that black should play R6. He could have devestated your corner and even gotten your whole group to flee across the board in an unprofitable escape.]
;B[ok];W[om];B[oj];W[fi]C[S7 better? I thought if I played F11 th two black stones would be unconditionnally dead, but they're only worth a few points. A play at S7 would secure a big corner.

RB>>> At least you are seeing the mistakes in hind sight. S7 is much bigger.]
;B[rm]C[Now that it's done...];W[pn]C[Should I have played R6 instead? That black stone wouldn't go anywhere after all..]
;B[bc];W[bb];B[di];W[ei]C[This is not needed right now. And it's only worth one point or two. N15 or O15 maybe? B16? Would G6 be useful (it seems like a small move but prevents black from going straight up)

RB>>> Yes to all of those moves plus S6! Any would have been better than this. It is hard to not respond sometimes. It is blood lust that does that to us as go players :) But we have to learn to be disciplined enough to look for the beter moves.]
;B[me]C[RB>>> Ouch. Big opportunity missed.];W[le];B[mg];W[nd]
;B[bd];W[kg]C[I thought this would giveme some territory between M15 K16, G12 and L13. Maybe P15 would have been a good threat, or P16 (which I play later on)

RB>>> You lost the game once by surrendering the lower left corner. But given that it is what an 8 point game at the end, you lost the game a second time by not playing O15/O14.]
;B[io];W[jj]C[Is that too far away from L13? Is M11 better (it expands even more the moyo but the inside is weak as it is the center)?
RB>>> M11 is better.];B[ne];W[ld]C[This move was intended to prevent B to play it and force me to make an empty triangle by playing N16 (in order to avoir B to connect)

RB>>> Okay empty triangles are bad shape, but who cares if you have bad shape if you capture the invading black stones?]
;B[nb];W[od]C[This does not increases my liberties.. But I thought it might weaken the black group There may be a possibility of double atari later with those three stones in diagonal.

RB>>> What this is good for is that it contests blacks move which he thought was sente. So now if he defends you can defend with N18. So you have taken one situation in sente and he the other. If you simply respond with N18, with a threat of your own, he can take sente again. If you let him do this all the way through the late middle game and end game, he can swing the score as much as 20-30 Points.]
;B[oe];W[mk]C[RB>>> But you skipped the defensive move at N18. N9 is of little real value. Why connect? Both groups are okay.]
;B[ka]C[I never saw this move coming. I should have played N18 before and that would have secured the upper side.

RB>>> Yep! This is a monkey jump and you can not cut it. You can only limit the damage. If you do it wrong it can cost you a lot.]

(;W[mb];B[ma];W[ib]C[I was totally unsure abuot how to respond to that. M18 looked no good becaus he would have played M19 and then could have gone through the line 19. So I decided to go back a little to be sure.]
;B[nc];W[md];B[im];W[lb]C[Didn't want to leave this like that... It bothered me.]
;B[la];W[kb];B[dh];W[ja];B[na]C[Now is there a way I coul play Q17 and kill this? Later on I made a living groups by going to the 3-3 point, but I couldn't think of something more aggressive (not sure there is a way, anyway)]

(;W[lo];B[ro]C[This is bad...

RB>>> Yes a lack of S6.];W[lp]C[There I thought i would threaten to cut thos two stones apart, as well as strengthen the O5 stone and the groups around to make a decent moyo out of it.

But maybe I'm only making black strengthen himself and make a big moyo for himself at the bottom.

RB>>>  Why threaten? Try N3.];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[mp];B[bn]
;W[bm];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah];W[bj];B[ab];W[ba];B[pr];W[oq];B[nr]
;W[or]C[Thoughtthis would isolate Q2, but it didn't turn out like that.]
;B[os];W[qr];B[mj];W[pq]C[The idea was good I think, but I idn't see I missed a stone at O4]
;B[ps];W[qs];B[ns];W[lj];B[kn]C[This reduces a lot what I wanted o be my territory.. It sure is difficult to get central territory...

RB>>> Indeed.];W[ln];B[lm];W[nj];B[mi];W[nk];B[oi];W[ni];B[li]
;W[nh];B[lg];W[mm];B[ll]C[There I was happy he didn't play one place up of that...]
;W[lk];B[ml];W[np];B[lr];W[nl];B[ko];W[km]C[bad move.Didn't realize i would be atari next move...
RB>>>  :) It happens];B[kl];W[ki];B[kk];W[mh]C[RB>>> Ouch!]
;B[lh]C[RB>>> Black missed L10.];W[kj];B[kh];W[jk]C[With this move and the next, I wanted to get some territory in the center whil getting sente by putting B atari.]

;B[pg];W[gp];B[hp];W[rp]C[There i finally choose to secure the sixpoints of the corner and not risk something. I am quite behind at this moment but during the game I wasn't sure and I would invade at R17. Was it possible to capture S5 and get a big corner?]

Not sure where I lost. Maybe at the beginning when i abandonned the lower left corner? Or itis a sum of other things... :)

RB>>> The left corner, N18, S8, O15. All would have given you the game.

Thanks for letting me review it. It is good to see you analyzing your games. Besides playing a lot and doing tsumego, reviewing your games and haveing a stronger player comment s on of the best htings you can do to get strongers. Keep it up!]
