C[Thanks for reviewing. I'm very confused in fuseki, so I would like discuss this part...

GP: I'm Graham Philips, a KGS 1 dan and British 1 kyu. I'll do my best to provide helpful comments, and a summary at the end, bearing in mind how close we are in rank. Many thanks for the incredibly detailed comments you've put at the areas you want attention paid.]

(;B[de]LB[kc:F][fd:E][od:C][pj:D][dn:B][fp:A]C[I wasn't sure, what to do know...

A, B, C I mean high or low...

at A I was afraid of pincer, which could weak my Q4 star stone
B might be good
C looks slow
D might be good
E gives white nice territory and help his D4 stone
F looks bad, because of 3rd line stone at D17

I like to approach komoku rather than hoshi... so I played D15

GP: I think this is approach is fine, and maybe even correct. It works reasonably well keeping White's position low on top, and makes White's approach at P16 less powerful. Regarding your alternative move suggestions:

A) I wouldn't be afraid of the pincer. Both the White and Black hoshi stones are fundamentally flexible positions, and aren't easily made weak without a double pincer. However, both "A" and "B" are unusual approaches (near high approach to a 4-4 stone) - very playable, but unusual. You could also effectively consider a low approach in this position - particularly the approach at F3 as that works will with Q4. However, I prefer your approach in game to approaching the bottom left.

B) See A, although I think this is slightly worse than A because the direction is less efficient (approaching at A gives a much better ability to make something worth while on the bottom edge).

C) Definitely too slow in my opinion, and also is not supported by a stone at the top edge (as a result, I'd prefer P17 anyway). Actually, P17 wouldn't be that bad, as it is very big, but it does feel non-urgent and slow for this stage in the fuseki.

D) Seems odd - If White then approaches at C it will feel misplaced misplaced, as it forms an important position in a framework that will never happen as White took such a key point. P17 first makes D an excellent move, but it feels like poor timing to take the right now, having played R16 (instead of Q16, or maybe even Q17).

E) Definitely not good. White will definitely respond with D15, and can then effectively pincer your stone with an unpleasant attack. G16 is almost playable, and after wD15 Black can extend to K16 and has a reasonably interesting position on the top.

F) An interesting idea, and maybe playable. It reduces the value of White making a shimari in the top left, and can work well with C and D if you can get both of those on the board. White almost definitely wouldn't let you, but it seems to make a lot of shape sense for a move. However, it looks very unusual.

In summary, I think your approach here is excellent - out of all the moves available on the board I'd have picked D15 too :)]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[Slow but strong, I didn't want to care about this group anymore, I wanted to develop my right side now...

GP: An excellent decision. I can't fault this move.];W[jc]
(;B[pj]TR[oc]C[It seems to me better to play this big move, and when white make kakari I can strengthen my position on right side...

GP: I disagree. I think wP16 now is a really urgent point for White to take, and this undermines the value of Q10 somewhat. It's obviously not a bad move, or a smalle move, but White will gain more at the top than Black will on the right. I would definitely prefer P17 here, which will give you a big and solid corner in sente (as White will want to take the right edge), and allow you to approach in the bottom left (see variation).

This move is bad primarily because your top right corner stone is on the third line with regards to the right edge.]
;W[oc]
(;B[pe]LB[pf:A]TR[qf]C[I wanted to press on white, A seems to me rather passive

GP: I like this move as it seems consistent with what you have played so far. R14 is also possible, as it doesn't leave weaknesses and works well with Q10 and removing possible invasion weaknesses on the right hand side. If White responds to R14 with P15, you can always play K15 :)]
;W[qb]C[GP: A poor choice of direction by White!];B[nd];W[nc]
;B[md];W[mc];B[ld]C[GP: Great followup by Black. I much prefer Black's whole board position now, his moyo is developing very well indeed.]
;W[lc]
(;B[jq]LB[pn:B][np:A][fq:C]C[Now I wans't sure again...

A, B looks slow
C is the same problem as before, with pincer white can weak my star stone...

GP: Yeah, I'm not even sure whether the tenuki was the right idea - K17 allows White to press around in really good shape, although he probably doesn't want to with Black's potential on the right. Still, better to tenuki optimistically than to respond when you didn't have to :)

With regards to this move in particular, I agree completely that A and B are far too slow, and playing too much within your framework. In fact, I sort of feel the same way (but not quite so much) about this move too. I think the approach at "C" is perfect, and well timed. Sure, White can pincer, but only if he wants to weaken his own corner, and if he doesn't, Black's lower position complements the right beautifully.

See variations using C.];W[qn];B[np];W[qq];B[qp];W[pr];B[rq]
TR[rp]C[GP: Don't leave White the S4 atari - Play S4 and you threaten as much without weakness of your own.]
;W[rr];B[pq];W[qr];B[nj];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[qo]TR[rn]C[GP: S6 is also possible, and reduces aji on the right in exchange for allowing White a cut that doesn't quite work yet (but because it _may_ become threatening, there's aji facing towards the middle from this obviously).]
;W[od];B[oe];W[kd]
(;B[mf]LB[lf:A]C[A better ? I read somewhere that this is good shape (center of three stones), but I don't understand it... My last question is about 41st move.

GP: I would definitely play A - it's the key shape point for Black's shape here. If White ignores, you get to push straight over the top of the White stones, making it virtually profit in sente. White can easily tenuki this move.]
;W[nn]
(;B[pn]TR[pm]C[GP: If you can't cut and kill easily, peep and chase :) (see variation)]
;W[pm];B[om];W[on]C[My mistake... I didn't think about ladder.

GP: Yeah, it's a sensible move if you had thought the ladder didn't work for White.]
;B[po];W[ol];B[qm];W[nm]
(;B[pl]TR[ql]C[GP: R8 is much much better. Playing a ko atari is always a risk, as the opponent will always be tempted to atari round the other side.]
;W[pk];B[ql]C[GP: Imagine you had played this first instead of Q8. Would you now play Q8 in response to Q9? (This type of analysis - tewari analysis - is very useful for evaluating the quality of moves in sequence - see variation on 51).]

C[GP: Good kill :)

So, in summary:

I actually think you really outplayed your opponent in the opening. Many of you decisions were top notch, and until the disaster with White fighting in the lower right / middle right, Black was comfortably in charge of the game.

*** IMPORTANT POINTS ***

1) Be very wary of ataring a ko stone. Because of the nature of kos and ko fights, your opponent will automatically try to find ways of profiting without connecting. Particularly ataring around the other side of your stone is something you must read before playing your atari.

2) Attack from a distance. You may know this already, and I'm aware you said yourself that the problem you encountered was not seeing the ladder. Thickness is something which you use like a school bully - it's a force of intimidation - if you can kill outright, and you can read it will work, then do so, otherwise peep, cap, steal eyes, and chase the group across the board in whatever direction turns all your thickness into points. This way, you should force your opponent to concede you 30 or 40 solid points of territory just to keep his group alive.

3) Your fuseki opening intuition is really good for someone that says he finds it confusing. I've offered as much input as I can to the openings, including a number of variations you hadn't considered as well as those you had. I'm interested that you pick a lot of high approaches, even to 4-4 stones, without much consideration to the low approaches. One thing you might be interested in is exploring a few low approach josekis (www.brugo.be gives some useful references, but you probably have a dictionary / library of your own) to add to your repertoire.

If you have any comments, questions, or responses to anything I've written, feel free to respond to the email when you get the review :)]

(;B[ql];W[pk];B[pl]C[GP: Would this move make so much sense now?]
))
(;B[pm];W[pn];B[om];W[on];B[ln]C[GP: Be more aggressive, but from a distance. Black's thickness is turning quickly into points, and even if White escapes, it's going to take a lot of moves to do so - each move of which should give Black a chance to take advantage. As a general rule, peep where White could have made eyeshape (especially if you profit yourself from the peeping move), then cap at the end of the stones. I think pro vs pro would judge this as White's group being dead.]

;B[co];W[do];B[go]C[GP: Now Black can start to build the chance of a very big framework in the middle, and the C5 stone has aji in both directions (C3 threatens to take the corner with C4 and D3 as miai, and Black's position at the top left is strong enough to make use of the peep too). White cannot make more than a few points at the bottom, and the lower left can only make good profit in gote if White tries to capture the single stone with a firm grip at C4 or C6 now. On top of this, Black's thickness is beginning to make the center very large.

Having said this, it also weakens Black's position in the lower right, and I'd have chosen to jump into the 3-3 instead of jump out to F5 :)]

(;B[fd];W[de];B[id]C[GP: Moved across one position to G16 + K16, this makes a lot sense, and has similarities to chinese openings. It feels odd, but it may well work ok.

)
(;B[kc]C[GP: This is interesting. Now P16 looks more interesting, White's move at C15 is less powerful, and you can start to build a good looking Moyo. I'm not sure about this move at all, but it looks interesting and worth trying out. I still would choose D15 myself out of all these alternatives :)]
