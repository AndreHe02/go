jpl: I'm about an 8-kyu player.  I'll do my best.];B[dd];W[pd]
;B[cp];W[pq];B[qn]C[I played R6 as a defensive opening, since white is much stronger, should i have been more aggressive?

jpl: I prefer to play joseki and fuseki moves.  3-stone difference isn't that big, and you shouldn't let that intimidate you.

Joseki is the 5-line.  Q5 or R5.];W[cj];B[qf];W[on];B[pj]C[this move seemed to make the side secure but it was too loose

jpl: It's a fuseki move.  It doesn't secure the side, but it gives you good influence on the side and some center influence.]
;W[ep];B[cm]C[jpl: This is a little loose.  Joseki asks for C6, I believe.  It's not close enough to the white stone at C10 to be a threat.  It puts zero pressure on E4, and is still a little weak with C4.]
;W[fc];B[dg]C[here i wanted to put the stone at C10 under pressure

jpl: You're not close enough to him to be a real threat.  Again, joseki suggests D14 or C14.]
;W[bg];B[ec];W[fd];B[be]C[jpl: A question to always ask yourself when you're about to make a play: Is this the strongest move on the board?

B15 isn't a bad move.  But is it your strongest move on the board?  It secures the corner, which would be good if you were ahead.  But I think there are other moves on the board that are bigger, if you're willing to possibly risk losing the corner in return for influence and territory elsewhere.

B15 isn't bad, and I might have played here.  But it's a good opportunity to think about other moves that might do more for you.]
;W[ne]LB[fj:B][gp:A][hd:F][jd:G][jj:D][ld:H][mj:E][np:C]C[i probably should have invaded near K16 at this point, or at the bottom of the board

jpl: I like any of the moves that I've lettered, in no particular order.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[qp]C[jpl: Okay, this isn't a horrible move, but it's pretty small.  What does it do for you?  It might gain you an additional 4 points.  Big deal.  You could still make any of those moves I lettered earlier.]
;W[hq]LB[jq:A][nq:B]C[could i have prevented white from taking the bottom side and how?

jpl: At this point -- maybe, with plays at A or B.  Tricky.  It would be a big fight, with you getting shoved out towards the center.]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[kq]LB[fn:A][ho:B][mo:C]C[jpl: At this point, the lower side is white's.  The best you can do is gain center influence while helping white to secure territory he already owns.

Maybe near A, B or C.];B[ch]C[jpl: Sorry, WAY too small.  It pushed on white a small amount, but it doesn't help you.]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[qq];B[pk]C[jpl: Good responses.];W[jd]C[waht should i have done at this point? I think i could have done more damage to whites territory at the bottom]
;B[ol]C[jpl: This is an interesting move.  You actually come out of most of this ahead.]
;W[mm]C[now white is extending his territory, how should i have attacked?]
;B[nm];W[no];B[mn];W[ng];B[nn]C[I clearly should have reacted to this move by white at O13 and defended my territory

jpl: You were focused on the lower side, and you come out of the next exhange making a trade -- you lose territory on the right side but bottled up white and gained center territory.]

[fn:F][gf:A][jp:D][lg:B][mi:C]C[jpl: Here is a good point to ask yourself what your goal is.  I like the various numbered plays.


A and B are likely to result in white securing the top side, but you would gain HUGE center influence.

C is a safer move, but white will probably gain a lot more center influence than you might like.

D is aggressive.

F is solid but maybe a little passive.  You wouldn't want white to play around K6 and eliminate a lot of your influence.]
;B[kp]C[this damaged whites terr. a lot but i think my loss was greater in the top right

jpl: Well, it's too small.];W[jq];B[jp];W[lm];B[ml];W[jm];B[em]
C[dont know why i played this];W[gf]LB[hf:A][le:B][oc:C]C[after this move it was surely too late to think about invading whites terr. at the top

jpl: probably, but you can make white pay for that territory by giving you the center.  Push hard on him.

You can do some scary threats with C.];B[ej];W[bh];B[ck]C[jpl: C9 is too small.  You really want to think about the center and about reducing white's top influence.]
;W[ci]C[jpl: White responds small (he has to).];B[di];W[bk]
;B[bl]C[could i have prevented white from living here?

jpl: Hmm.  I don't like answering those questions.  I rarely go for a kill.  Instead, I make my opponent pay dearly to make the group live.  Give him those few points and gain huge in the center.]
;W[aj];B[dj];W[bi];B[cg]C[jpl: Small move.  Yeah, it's solid, but again, you need to think about the center.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[pp];W[po];B[pn]C[there was almost a chance of saving the stone at O3, and killing white stones]
;W[oq];B[pe]C[jpl: VERY small move.];W[od];B[dp];W[gr];B[eo]
;W[lr];B[lp];W[kj]C[jpl: Look what white is doing -- he's bottling you in when you should have had all that center territory.]

jpl: I think there are three things you can do to increase your play by several stones almost immediately.

First, study opening joseki a bit.  This is just something you always have to do.  However, I don't think better understanding of Joseki would have mattered much in this game.

Next, periodically throughout the game, ask yourself "what is my goal at this point?"  Then work towards that goal.  Basically, just put the stones down, sit back, and give yourself some time to evaluate the board.

Last, understand that the game is a tradeoff.  Your opponent gains some territory, you gain influence.  Don't make plays that aren't fair.  Don't make plays that force your opponent to strengthen his territory unless you get something out of it at the same time.  It's good to push on your opponent, but make sure you do so from a direction that nets you positive results.

If you practice these last two things, you'll gain 5 stones in just a few games.]
