C[All about whether I can prove that B's early   mistake, conceding lots of thickness, was     enough to lose.

Joan: There are more mistakes, but maybe the first is the bigger.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[po]C[I don't much like conceding two shimaris

Joan: There's an old proverb about that being bad for white,
          but it's from the no-komi times, I've examples of white
          playing for example xinese fuseki against black 2 shimaris and
          winning  too.];B[pl]C[I think that this pincer is good?

Joan : Looks good. But look at the position  after
           standard josekis are played.];W[mp]C[Joan: The meaning of this stone is sacrifice, a tipical
           continuation begins with B-P5]
(;B[op]C[This must be bad?

Joan: It's bad.];W[oo]C[Only way I could see to play.   my fear now is that I'll mistime things and let   B extend from 7.

Joan: That wouldn't be bad  if black is sealed in the
          Lower-Right corner and white get a wall working
          with the nirensei at the left out of W-N4. In fact
          that would be very good for white.];B[np];W[no];B[mq]
;W[lq]C[What's best for B now?   Simple descent from 13 might let   him get back to extend from 7?

Joan: B-N2 W-M4 B-Q11 (or B-O8) W-D10 (or W-K16) and
          it looks too good for white.];B[lp];W[mo]C[Or perhaps use the 15 as a sacrifice?

Joan: to get what in compenssation? Points made 1 by 1 playing
          in the second line ? 2nd line is the road to defeat :-)
          I think now B-L4 is the only move]
(;B[kq]C[Don't think B ca do this?

Joan: B-L4 instead seems the only way to pick-up a fight
           worth fighting, but black doesn't look well at all.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[mr];B[nq];W[kp];B[lo];W[jp]C[Joan: Even if the shicho were good for black this is good
          for white.];B[nr];W[ln]C[Joan: if the shicho were good ...]

(;B[ms];W[ko];B[ls]LB[pi:A][jr:B]C[I figured that I could only reasoably connect   if a subsequent press against 17 and 19 was   sente.     If I connect, B,plays A and can ignore B   then I didn't feel I'd got enough.

Joan: if you connect black can play J3 and the echange
          is bad for white, leaving A aside. I think that A is
          not that important as W-S5 would threaten both
          the side and the corner and thus K16, D10 or even
          J3 are better points for white.];W[pi];B[ml];W[qf]
C[Joan: I don't like this move: you are approaching the only
          thickness black has, I think that keeping pressure on
          the 2 black stones would be better.];B[kl]C[  Not sure what plan W can have now.     I thought at the time that developing at   the 10-4 points was too hard to turn into territory.

Joan: The idea of playing 10-4 points is not to make
           territory but thickness, as black has a weak group
           floating in the center it looks like a good idea.
           B-L8, by the way, feels like a good move.];W[cm]
C[I wanted B to approach the other corner   because I felt there was a better chance     of getting back to work on 31 and 33

Joan: as I said, 10-4 points are far better for this
          than a territory making move as W-C7.
          I don't mean W at C7 is bad, I don't know,
          but it does'nt have such a strong effect on the
          center stones,];B[il]C[This struck me as either slow or patient.   Is my thickness coming under threat?   Surely not!

Joan: but the 2 stones at Q11 and R14 maybe yes!
          and if black takes at M4 your thikness will rather
          look like a dragon: a target to attack!
          Any way I think that this J8 and J3 can be regarde
          as miai and I would try to play a bigger point
          somewhere else ... or may be there's not a bigger
          point ?];W[gc]C[Joan: now that black is thicker in the center maybe it's
          allright to play territorially, I would say that white
          is still ahead, but black has a chance attacking the 2
          white stones on the right.];B[kc]C[Joan: I don't like this move, looks too warm for what
          black needs.];W[qj]C[This was meant to allow me to either   ttack between 31 and 7 or go in   between 5 and 37

Joan: agreed. And reinforcing the weakest group
           when one is ahead is usually a good idea.];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[cj]C[Another weakness. Would B have been better     extending one space fewer?

Joan: Yes, i think so. Or maybe playing somewhere
           else, I don't think that black can afford a too
            conservative line of play.];W[nl];B[qm]
(;W[qo]C[I was glad to be asked to play here

Joan: I think there's no need, look at the alternatives
          begining with white playing O8 for example.
          P8 could aslso be interesing.];B[nk];W[nm];B[ok];W[mc]
C[I want to go back and cut 31 from 45, so I'm   rying for a bit of thickness, or profit will do.

Joan: I agree with the Idea, but now B-P15 can setup
          a counter attack with B-R12, if you don't think            it's a good idea to cut immediately at N9 then
          I think R5 is too slow, and anyway I think it's not
          too good to cut now, so R5 was too slow.];B[ic];W[oe]
C[Joan: maybe better at N16 anyway, or P16 or some kosumi
          ( M16 or o16). In any case you have to get thickness
          to be able to cut at N9.];B[mb];W[lb]C[Joan: B-N18 is the tipical sacrifice to get thickness, playing M18
           is falling in black's plot. W-O17, B-O16, W-P16, B-Q17
           ( or alternatively, W-Q17) seem better lines of play to keep
          the cut at N9 a possibility.];B[lc];W[nb];B[md];W[nc]
;B[nd];W[ob];B[pc]C[Joan: instead of Q17, connecting at P16 at once maybe
          would be better for black.];W[ma];B[ng]C[I was happy until B played here.   Seems like a nice point

Joan: It's a nice point :-)
          You've tricked yourself in the upper side, getting
           small profit when the important point was getting
           thickness to be able to cut at N9.];W[ni];B[mi];W[re]
C[Meant to be sente so that I could   do some more with 62

Joan: cutting at P16 instead open better possibilities to reduce
           the center.];B[od];W[hd]C[But I began to be concerned about B's growing potential
This was meant to solidify the top left, threaten
39 and 41 and keep the centre under control

Joan: I think that attacking the 2 black stones on the
          left would be a better way to accomplish this.];B[dh]
C[I suppose B needs this but now I think   I just should always get more territory

Joan: agreed, D12 is too slow, and too small in
           territory terms. The only possible black
           territory to speak off is the center, and is
           too open to let it alone. But allowing W-C12
           also looks bad, maybe instead of D12 E10 would
           give black more chances of doing something on
           the lower side or the center while taking care of
           this weak spot.];W[hf]C[I wondered about just sealing off the bottom left
but I though that this was enough to ensure that
B could not get enough territory

Joan: with all the aji at M16, and around N11, white
          can play a bit more agressive, without need of
          taking any serious risk, and try to get sente to
          do both. But H14 is nevertheless a good move.];B[cq]
;W[cp]C[Would it be better to play the other way?
I thought that it would be hard to ensure any
territory. This way keeps things under control.

Joan: The other too :-) and threatens making K2 or
           J3 a big point for white, getting sente to be
           the first to play in the center is important, I think.]
;B[dr]C[Surprised by this.

Joan: it's joseki, but doesn't look like the
          good one here.]
(;W[fp]C[Joan: seems good enough, linking both groups denies
           black any chance of upsetting the game.];B[bq];W[er]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[dq];W[eq];B[bs]C[After this B lived in gote and I got 15 or   so points on the outside. B could not build   enough in the middle so I won by 10 points or so.    Joan: playing D12 beacause of C10 allowed white
          to play a free move in the center, so all of the possible
          benefit of white's mistake in the upper side vanished.             I think that white's 2 shimaris in the left side where too
          mild, not realising all the potential of the position, but
          then I try usually too hard, and your style is more pragmatic
          than mine, so maybe you are right here.])

          play, but all are more or less like this.
          I prefer the alternative line of play for white (going
          for thickness) but it's beyond my understanding of the
          game whether one is really better than the other.
          In fact half of the variations on this line are not that
          easy to evaluate globally.])
(;W[op]C[Joan: Thickness:];B[pp];W[on];B[qo];W[no];B[qn]C[Joan: not the main variation, but white's ponnuki work
          well with the nirensei on the left, while black has all
          his stones on the right side, too busy making territory.
          And white has sente indeed!])))
