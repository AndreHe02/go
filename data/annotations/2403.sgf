C[HotSoup : I thought I was playing rather confiently at the beginning, but at the end I just lost focus, making some stupid moves... and in the end, it looked like I lost, so I resigned....

Ghost : I reviewed this game from White's (Hotsoup) point of vue.
Globally, aside from reading mistakes, and life and death mistakes that are due to beginner status, the main problem is huge mistakes in the direction of play. White also lacks real strategy. White invaded all the framework there was to invade, sometimes lived, sometimes died, but did not really construct his own territory.

For white to progress, a few points may be benefical, aside from playing a lot of games :o) 
- studying life and death (so as not to die and kill the other guy :o))

- studying just a little  fuseki (it's strange that you selected a slow fuseki for yourself and went on fighting for the rest of the game)

- Play a little more solidly and stop trying to invade all there is. The aim of the game is not to invade the opponent's territory but to have more than him.

- and remember : groups have to get out first, and makes two eyes second.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[qd];W[dq]LB[do:A][cp:B][dp:C]C[Ghost : This is the wrong direction because it invites a black approach at A (see variation). Playing White 4 at B or C is the right move.]

(;B[kd]C[Ghost : with Black 7, Black uses the high chinese fuseki.]

(;W[jp]LB[cf:a][oc:b][od:c]C[Ghost : Here, I think White plays a bit too pasively. Simply more or less mirroring the play of Black is not good. A classic answer to the high chinese fuseki is simply a (see variation). If White wants to fight, an approach at b or c is also possible, but more risky (see variations)]
;B[cj]LB[qn:a]C[Ghost : Black 9 is big, but an approach at a would be better]
;W[qf]LB[oc:a][od:b]C[Ghost : this makes no sense. As said previously, approaching at a or b is better. Here, Black answer at a or b would also be strong since it would make a shimari. (corner enclosure). Basically, here white allows black to enclose a corner.]
;B[qh]C[Ghost : This is not good. The corner is not closed and white 's stone can escape.]

(;W[od]TR[qh]C[HotSoup : This move I tried to get the corner... but then I thought I shoulda moved on the star point... but it was

Ghost : Why not play this directly ? no need to play White 10. This is a little late, since now, black marked stone will be usefull.  But indeed, one W10 was played, playing on the star point was better for white (see variation)

But you have to keep in mind that you will not be able to "get the corner", you can reduce it a little, get influence, etc. You cannot have all the territory there is to play.]
;B[pf];W[pe];B[qe]
(;W[pd]TR[qf]C[Ghost : why connect here ? this makes bad shape (empty triangle) and anyway, black cannot cut. Better to make correct shape with atari from the outside which makes proper use of the marked stone (see variation) Do not be overly concerned with territory]
;B[rf];W[qc]LB[of:a][pg:b][le:c]C[Ghost : This is a slow move, and bad shape. 'a' is still the key point. Followed by Black 'b', white 'c'.]
;B[nc];W[md];B[mc]LB[co:a][df:b][cl:c][qk:d][fd:e]C[HotSoup : from here I realized that 18 was dead... and tried to go under him...

Ghost : 18 is not dead, and may become usefull (see variation). Going under is a mistake. It's endgames move, there are still a lot of big points on the board (a, b, c, d, e)]

(;W[ob]LB[oc:a][pc:b][nd:c]C[Ghost : This is bad, Black 'a', White 'b' , Black 'c' ruins everything. Variation is better]
;B[nd];W[mb];B[lc]C[HotSoup : I guess I wasn't reading too well... but after I played it, I thought about it somemore and realized that if he moves below 20 then i wasted 2 moves...

Ghost : Exactly. This is very bad for white. The group can die pretty easily and made no territory nor influence.]
;W[lb]C[Ghost : White should have gotten out first with the sequence evoqued ealier and kept those moves for the endgame]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[nb];W[na]C[HotSoup : I was hoping he would screw up and not go for 20... just wishful thinking... it all went down hill for my invasion corner here....

Ghost : the main rule is to never hope the opponent will screw up. You have to make moves that will work even if your opponent makes no mistakes.
Consequently, the sequence is desastrous for white.];B[pb];W[qb]
;B[oa];W[jb]LB[of:a]C[Ghost : Also a mistake. Black 'a' kills white]
;B[of]C[Ghost : Black doesn't miss it :o)];W[rd];B[re];W[sd]
;B[rb]C[HotSoup : I believe I was hitting myself on the head from this point... I didn't see that 37 is a very critical point... so I kept on thinking that I could somehow make 2 eyes...I realize now that 37 is a critical point... but I dunno just can't seem to think so well during the game... especially when things are looking down for me..

Ghost : actually, B37 wasn't the critical move, B33 was, because if the white groups gets into the center, it needs not get two eyes in the corner.

The key to life is get out first, and if you see you cannot, make two eyes. The opposite doesn't work, because the opponent will let you live small, and get enormous thickness.
 Black has a lead of more than 30 points, and imposing thickness. The game is effectively over]
;W[sb];B[ra];W[gc];B[fc]C[HotSoup : I felt that from here on out, I really gotta think better... concentrate more...]
;W[fb]LB[cc:a][ic:b]C[Ghost : Mistake. Do not get under the opponent's stones to try and mae life. Get out first.this is an endgame move and removes your option at invading directly at a. Anyway, black should probably have answered at 'b' first. The following sequence is good for white, but because of black's mistakes]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[ge]C[HotSoup : I was trying to get around to his other side...

Ghost : No, you tried to get out in the center. Go isn"t just a succession of invasions. You have to build territory sometime. To attack, you use thickness. You have no real territory and no thickness. Work on getting some. You will not win consistenly by just destroying the opponent's territory]
;B[ea]LB[dg:a]C[Ghost : Big Mistake, playing 'a' is much safer, and effectively wins the game.]
;W[fa]LB[gb:a]C[Ghost: mistake. Black 'a' captures the three stones.]
;B[da];W[hb]C[Ghost : A mistake by Black gives life.];B[ql]

(;W[qn]LB[qq:a][mp:b]C[HotSoup : I didn't want him getting into my corner here, so I move 52...

Ghost : This doesn't protect the corner from an invasion at 'a' (see variation). This move attacks the marked stone (which is useless in the situation). Protecting at 'b' would have been better (see variation)]

(;B[nl]C[Ghost : Good point for black. Black leads by about 60 points.]

(;W[ef]LB[cc:a]C[HotSoup : I thought  54 was good... but I guess it wasn't deep enough...

Ghost : If what you wanted was to invade, a preparation at 'a' is better. See variation]
;B[df]LB[cf:a]C[Ghost : this is too close, 'a' would be safer]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[cg]LB[eg:a]C[HotSoup : so I decided I wanna get the left side of the board...

Ghost : this is a mistake. Black can cut at 'a'.
This kind of move (justified by your commentary) is what made you lose. You just try to invade the opponent's territory and "get it". It's much easier to make territory where YOU are strong (like the bottom), and just *reduce* the opponent's. You cannot get everything. Also, you must stick with a line of play. Your bottom is wide open.]
;B[ee];W[ff];B[bg]LB[co:a][qq:b][jg:c][hd:d]C[Ghost : Black is overly defensive : those are endgame moves. Black 'a' and 'b' and 'c' and 'd' are much bigger.]
;W[bh];B[bf];W[ci]TR[cj]C[Ghost : Because black played small moves, white got thickness to attack black's marked stone]
;B[cm]TR[cj]C[Ghost : mistake. Since the marked stone is weak, blakc cannot count on it to connect to Black 65]
;W[cn]C[Ghost : Mistake. It's way too close Making a corner enclosure at 'a' is much stronger for both attack and defense since White 66 is very weak]
;B[dn]
(;W[do]LB[co:a]C[Ghost : Too greedy, 'a' was stronger. See variation]
;B[co];W[bn];B[eo];W[dp];B[bm]LB[en:a]C[Ghost : Mistake. Protecting the cut at 'a' is stronger. White should therefore play 'a' as in variation.]

(;W[bo];B[jn]TR[ge][ff][ef][dg][cg][bh][ci]LB[dm:a]C[Ghost : the cut at 'a' can kill the black group on the left by using the thickness of the marked stones. Black's move here makes little sense. See variation for white]

(;W[en]C[Ghost : This is the right plan, but the wrong cut :o)]
;B[dm];W[fo]LB[fn:a]C[Ghost : small. 'a' is stronger because there is no cut]
;B[hp]C[Ghost : Black is greedy here.];W[io]C[Ghost : good point.]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[fn]C[Ghost : this is a good move by black since it enables him to escape. Unfortunately both players did not see it, because they were bent on fighting (more like capturing stones). (see variation)]
;W[em]
(;B[ep]LB[go:a]C[Ghost : Black should have played 'a' first to escape

;B[in];W[hk];B[gi];W[fj];B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[hl];B[iq]TR[hk]
[hm][hl][hn]C[Ghost : It seems white didn't understand the meaning of this move. It's not to make life, it's not to make territory. It's to increase the number of liberties of the black group to capture the marked stones. As a consequence, the following sequence greatly favors black.]
;W[hq];B[ip];W[jo];B[kr];W[mq];B[lr];W[mr];B[ij]C[Ghost : This moves kills the marked stones. Black now has enough liberties to win the capturing race Black has a lead of about 60/70 points. The game is over. The rest of the moves have no real  effect on the score. This ends the commentary move by move.]

;W[nn];B[pn];W[ro]C[HotSoup : this was just a mistake... I was reading what would happen if I moved under 139 and accidentally pushed the place at 140... to be honest I thought I would be ok.. and I was gonna move up near 46 area... but I made a misclick...]
;B[ie];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[hh];W[jg];B[if];W[kh];B[ii];W[jh]
C[HotSoup : here... I was thinking maybe get some thing in the center... but after I thought about it, I knew I'm not good enough to get territory like that... and here... I was also getting yelled at... so I felt pretty crappy... and in the end... I made wayy wayy too many stoopid moves... like going in when I know I would lose... or just throwing stones out there...

Ghost : It's too late, it's impossible to live in the center. It's all black.That is why black let white take the bottom, to get a lot of thickness.
You cannot simply decide to "get some territory" and have some by launching a few stones in enemy territory without any support.]
