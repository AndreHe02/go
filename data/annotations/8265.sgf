C[Please comment for the M3D side, although comments for both sides are appreciated.
I entered some remarks and questions in the files starting wit "MR".


*Hi, I'll mark my comments with the *. Just a quick disclaimer, I don't know what the best moves are, the moves I say are better are just my suggestions. They are the moves I would play. Hope they are useful to you.]

(;W[qp]TR[pd]C[*I prefer this move here. Since the triangled stone is high, it is looking at influence more than territory, by playing like this he has no good approach moves on your corner stones and it will be difficult for him to use it to make a moyo. Also you can approach that stone on either side.
Your move is not neccessarily a mistake, this is just another idea that you might like to consider.]
