C[Hi,

I play Black in this game. I need special comment on move 31 and general comments on the game.

Many thanks,

Nicolas.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cc];B[fq];W[dn];B[kq]C[Maybe a bit thin and low. I would prefer K4.]

;W[cj];B[ch];W[ej];B[pj]C[Good. P4 is another possibility here, but I can't say which is best.]
;W[gb]C[I'm not sure I like this. Even though it's nice to connect the stones, it's not that urgent, and it's on the 2:nd line.

The point both sides want to play now is P4.];B[fh]C[It's probably wise to answer White's G18. Since White's move is low, it's not a bad exchange for Black.]
;W[dr]
(;B[er]C[Even if it seems to be a big loss to let White follow up with H3, I think it's even bigger to play P4 now. White may even feel that he doesn't have time to play H3 then.]

(;B[fr]C[Black must play E4 and then connect. (See variation.)]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[op]
(;B[pp]C[This is an unusual answer to White's high approach. My first reaction is that it's a contact move, when White has played fairly deep into Black's area. It seems this will only help White. See variations for other alternatives.]

(;W[oq]C[Maybe extending to P5 is better. (See variation)]
(;B[pr]C[Wrong direction. P5 is the important point. (See variation)]
;W[on]
(;B[fo]C[White will not answer this, it's too small, and not where the focus is. Black should have played Q7 for instance.]

(;B[ci];W[bi];B[ei];W[bh];B[dh];W[jf];B[ln]C[Good move. Very big at this point.]
;W[jj]C[A good reducing move. Black should probably simply answer at J9 or K8. White has quite large territories on the upper and left sides, and Black's only potential is now in the center.]
