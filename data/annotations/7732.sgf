C[Hello!

I'll include a short summary at the end of the game (last move).  If you have any questions regarding some of the comments or variations I've made (or anything else) my email is duder@hotmail.co.uk

Hope you find this useful!

[qh:A]C[A or B are more usual in the opening fuseki, but there is nothing inherently wrong with this move.]
;B[qi]LB[pf:A]C[Should be at A, white fails to punish this]
(;W[jd]LB[pf:A]C[This move is premature - white can play A in sente first (see variation)]
;B[ql]LB[pf:A]C[Again, A is a point neglected by both sides.]
;W[dn]LB[do:A]C[Usually A but this move is fine too];B[do]LB[fp:A]
[gp:B]C[A and B are alternatives];W[co];B[cp];W[eo];B[dp]C[Correct sequence of moves so far...]
;W[go]TR[cn][en]C[This is a very thin move from white, leaving two cutting points in his position]
(;B[gp]LB[cn:A][en:B]C[G4 is a dubious move from black, with no clear outcome.  A or B is the proper way to exploit white's position (see variations)]
;W[fp]TR[cn][en]C[The cutting points remain, but it would be too passive not to play this]
(;B[fq]LB[gq:A]C[The move at A is more solid.  Even if white prevents the connect black still has options (see variation)]
;W[gq]
(;B[ep]C[Probably the best move];W[hp];B[gr]LB[fr:A]C[Black should play at A to prevent the cut]
(;W[hr]LB[fr:A]C[White fails to punish blacks mistake, should be at A (see variation)]
;B[hs]LB[er:A][fr:B]C[Black needs to defend the cut with A or B, this move is too aggressive]
;W[fr];B[eq];W[gs]LB[cn:A]C[Black can live with A (see earlier variation)]
;B[er];W[es]LB[pf:B][cn:A][po:D][lq:C]C[This move is worth little and typical of the endgame.  White should either protect the cut at A or turn his attention elsewhere (e.g. playing B or invading with C or D)]
;B[ds]LB[cn:A]C[Again, this is a small scale move. Playing A on the other hand helps black a) get a strong living shape, and b) invade white's territory on the left side]
;W[is];B[fs]C[Neither side has anything to gain from this ko]
;W[gr];B[jr]LB[mq:A]C[Helps close off the bottom side, but still leaves black a bit weak.  I would prefer a move such as A]
;W[es]LB[cn:A]C[Another small scale move from white.  Nevertheless, blacks situation is looking precarious now, a move is certainly needed to avoid capture...]
;B[js]LB[cn:A][po:B]TR[jp][jr]C[Another small scale move.  Apart from needing to attend the group in the bottom left (with A), black should be looking to play bigger moves.  for example, a move at B works excellently with the two marked stones to make a box-like territory.]
;W[bp]LB[bo:A]C[An aggressive move, but an overplay, black can cut at A and live]
(;B[bq]LB[bo:A]C[Better to cut at A first];W[cr]LB[bo:A]C[White seizes upon the vital point but leaves himself weak at A...]
(;B[dr]LB[bo:A]C[Should be at A (see variation)];W[cq];B[ap]
;W[cs];B[lq]LB[po:B][np:A]TR[jp][jr][js]C[Slightly inefficient move (too close to the marked stones), better placed at A or B]
;W[jo]C[Good move, white is using his strong position]
(;B[kn]LB[ko:A]C[Should be at A];W[jl]LB[ko:A]TR[kn]C[White fails to attack the marked stone by pushing through with A]
;B[mo]LB[ko:A]C[A strange move (would prefer A) but ultimately protects the weakness and makes territory in the bottom right]
;W[jh]LB[cc:B][fc:C][nc:E][nd:D][cf:A]C[White is beginning to form a vast moyo.  However, black still has chances to invade]
;B[jj]C[not a bad move, but probably better saved til later.  invading the top and left sides is definitely blacks priority]
;W[ij];B[jk];W[ik];B[kl];W[jm]C[Proper sequence of moves so far]
;B[jn]LB[km:A]C[Should be at A, black leaves himself open];W[kk]
LB[kj:A][km:B]C[Black needs to ataria at A to avoid the capture of the two black stones.  White will then push through with B, punching a hole into blacks wall, so it may be better to play B sacrificing the two stones]
;B[il];W[kj];B[ji];W[ki]C[Blacks stones are caught in a ladder]
;B[ii];W[hi];B[im];W[ih];B[km];W[jk]LB[fc:B][nd:C][cf:A]C[Black recovers well, but white now has a strong position in the centre.  Black desparately needs to invade the top and left sides before white solidifies his moyo]
;B[io];W[hn];B[in];W[hl]LB[fd:B][df:A][pf:C]C[This is of little value.  Better to solidify white's lead with A B or C (C is probably the best move as it is sente)]
;B[nk]TR[dd]C[Locally this is a good move, but black is way behind on points, so his priority is really to make or break territory elsewhere (the marked stone looks pretty lonely, black should be able to gain something in the top left...)]
;W[mg]LB[fd:C][df:B][pf:A]C[In the local context it is much better to play A, force black into a low position, then play a move such as P12 or O12.  However, in the global context, B or C would work as an excellent followup to A]
;B[og]LB[nc:C][qc:B][nd:D][pf:A]C[Playing at A is a more solid move, and allows followup moves such as B C or D]
;W[ne]LB[pf:A]C[Again, better to attack with A.  Always look for attacking moves which also defend or create territory - learning to make efficient moves is key to becoming a strong go player]
;B[lk]LB[cc:B][fc:C][cf:A]C[This move would be ok, but there are still holes in whites territory.  I won't mention this again, I'm sure you get the message :) Anything i say now will be relative to the local situation]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[nh];B[oh];W[qc];B[oe]C[A nice pushing move];W[od]
;B[nf];W[pe];B[of];W[pf];B[me];W[nd];B[ng];W[mh];B[mf];W[nj]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[pi];W[qg];B[ph];W[rf]C[Unnecessary, the black stone cannot escape]
;B[ni];W[mj]
(;B[lf]LB[kf:A]C[A timid move - black could comfortably play A  (see variation)]
;W[kf]LB[jf:A]C[Simply protecting with A is better.  Bumping against an enemy stone can be dangerous...]
;B[ke];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[kd];B[nc];W[nb]
;B[kb]LB[mb:A]C[White plays A and the three black stones die]
;W[jb];B[mb];W[oc];B[jf];W[kg];B[bo];W[cp];B[hf]LB[je:A]C[Playing A is the simplest way of dealing with the threat]
;W[if]
(;B[ig]LB[ie:A][je:B]C[Atari at A works better - allows the connect at B (see variation)]
;W[ie];B[ff]LB[df:A]C[Nice idea, expanding into space, but I'd prefer to see this at A - the main difference is that black has a foothold on the side, and stands a better chance of saving the black stones]
;W[je]LB[gg:A][hg:B]C[White gains relatively little from this - a move at A or B deals a killer blow to blacks position on the other hand]
;B[jg];W[hg];B[dg]LB[df:A]C[The knights move generally gives poor shape for making eyes - probably better at A]
;W[cg]C[There is a go proverb that says "Never attach against a weak enemy stone."  Better to pressure black with a move such as A - if black manages to live, the territory he gains will be small.]
;B[df]LB[cf:A]C[A is more of a fighting move, whereas D14 is a strong solid move.  D14 seems to work better here]
;W[ee]C[The peep is a nice way to stop black from making eyes]
;B[ef]TR[cg]C[The marked stone is starting to look a bit vulnerable...]
;W[gf]LB[he:A]C[Better at A - playing here allows black to force]
;B[ge];W[he];B[gg]LB[gd:B][gh:A]C[Black has nothing to gain from taking the ko, so white should play or B (see variation]
(;W[hf];B[fh];W[gh];B[cf];W[ch];B[dh];W[ci];B[fe];W[fg]LB[fd:A]
TR[dd][ee]C[Whilst this reduces black to zero eyes, the marked stones look very precarious next to blacks thick shape - a move at perhaps A would have been better]
;B[fc];W[eb]LB[ec:A]C[Black has the option to end in sente by pushing through with A (see variation)]
(;B[fb];W[ec]
(;B[ce]LB[bd:A]C[Again, black can afford to extend with a knights jump to A (see variation)]
;W[cd];B[de];W[ed];B[bd];W[fd]LB[bc:A]C[White should definitely play A - black is in a desparate situation and needs to make eyes - neglecting to play A allows black to take the corner and live]

(;B[cn];W[cm]TR[dl][an]C[Blacks liberties have been reduced to two and loses the capturing race]
;B[ak];W[dl];B[ai];W[al];B[na]LB[ej:A]C[A is another possible ko threat]
;W[an];B[ob];W[pb];B[oa]LB[ja:C][pa:A][rh:B]C[If black is going to play a gote move it may as well be A (worth 1 more point).  B and C are bigger moves however]

[kq][kr][lr][sr][ks][ss]C[Ok so in summary I'd say there were a lot of elementary errors made by both players - there were times when it was clear what a certain move was trying to acheive but it was simply misplaced.

I would recommend to both players studying some go problems (www.goproblems.com is an excellent resource) - this will help inform your intuition, and you will find with time that the positions you study become second nature.  Combine this with plenty of practice and you will advance quickly!
