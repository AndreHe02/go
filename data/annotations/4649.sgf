C[kousei [12k?\]: hi, gg
TeeSushi [11k\]: moin

@ Reviewer: Thx a lot for reviewing this game *bow* ^^

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2dan at the local club.  Hope this review will be useful.  Please use an SGF viewer that displays variations nicely; qgo, ggo, jago, glGo, cgoban1 will all work fine, but cgoban2 (the KGS client) has some issues.]
;B[dp]C[TeeSushi [11k\]: viel spa?];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[nq]
;W[qn];B[jp]C[Is that too risky? (K4)

crux: No, that's fine; the pattern on the lower side is quite common.]
;W[jd];B[dj]LB[ce:A][qf:B]C[Is there a better move than this one?

crux: It can hardly be a bad idea to make a shimari at A.  Approaching at B seems like another standard idea.  The game move seems OK, but leaves White a lot of room to approach the corner near A.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[ch]LB[dj:A][fc:B]C[is that attack appropriate or should i have attacked somewhere at R11 or maybe strengthened my moyo in the down left corner?

crux: The white stones are already pincered by your stone at A, so in a sense the game move isn't needed.  Simply continuing at B might be effective for Black.]

(;W[ge];B[qi]LB[qf:A]C[I'm not very good at invasions ^^ How's this one / What would have been a better alternative?

crux: Better to approach the corner at A, I believe.];W[qg]

;B[pk];W[ok];B[pj];W[on]LB[pn:A][rn:B]C[crux: White should just connect at A.  This move leaves Black with B.]
;B[gc]LB[fp:B][qc:A]C[I wasnt really sure about this one, it seemed pretty small to me.

crux: Some other options I'd consider here are A and B.];W[hc]
;B[gd]C[crux: Again, playing into bad shape.];W[hd];B[he];W[fd]
;B[fc];W[hf];B[ie];W[gf];B[if];W[hi];B[jc]TR[he][ie][if]C[crux: Good eye for a vital point, but the question is whether this helps the three critical stones?  It seems like you tried to invade the top side while having a weak group in the center - a bad idea.  Also, you provoke White to take away one of your liberties.]
;W[id]C[crux: Now the three-stone group lost a liberty, and Black really should defend it.]

(;B[nc];W[kc]C[crux: White can be pretty happy with the way things are going.]
;B[pc];W[qc]
(;B[pb]LB[qb:A]C[crux: Poor; this must be at A locally.  The game move is a bit heavy and lets White take the whole corner.]
;W[qb];B[od];W[pe];B[lb];W[jb];B[me];W[kf]C[i pretty much abandoned J14, bad idea?

crux: If White captures them, all his stones are safe.  But I don't think an attempt to save them right now is likely to be productive.]
;B[jg];W[lf]
(;B[nf]C[crux: This move isn't defending the weaker group of stones.  The ones at the top look like they can take care of themselves for now.]
;W[li];B[pg];W[ji];B[cm];W[gp];B[gq]LB[dq:A]C[crux: Attaching to a stone makes it stronger.  There's no way to connect underneath, even if that was desirable.  Black could keep the white stone weak by enclosing the corner at A.]

;W[co];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[bp]LB[bo:A][em:B]C[crux: Should be A locally; but possibly B looking at the big picture.]
;B[bq];W[bo];B[en]C[this onewas quite risky now that i look at it. I cut the groups in order to kill E5 which didnt work (maybe you can explain why it didnt later on).]
;W[dn];B[em];W[dm];B[el];W[dl]
(;B[hl]TR[el][em][en]LB[ek:A]C[crux: The three black stones don't have many liberties.  White can escape (and thus damage Black's stones on the side) by playing at A.]

;W[fi]C[the sequence up to here seemed a little fishy to me. was there a possibility to gain moe than that?

crux: To be quite honest, I can't help but think that White should have been able to do better from that situation.]
;B[ei];W[bi]
(;B[fj];W[gi];B[ej]C[crux: This move in particular does not seem productive.  You're saving one non-critical stone which was played as a forcing move.]
;W[bj];B[lm]LB[qf:B][qq:A]C[that one again was pretty risky. is there a rule or something like that based on these kind of jumps?

crux: This one is not risky, but inefficient.  Black is extremely strong towards the left; there's a couple of proverbs to be aware of: "don't play close to strength" (your own or your opponent's); "don't use thickness to build territory".  Invading at A seems possible; the hane at B also looks like a largeish endgame move.]
;W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[crux: Very submissive; Black chooses the defensive move in an area where he's extremely strong.  See variations for other ideas.]
;W[mp];B[kq];W[np];B[oq];W[pq]LB[rn:A]C[crux: There goes the chance to do something in the corner.  Black should probably play A immediately now that other options are gone.]

(;B[ko]C[crux: The center territory is small.];W[jm]
(;B[kk]LB[kl:A]C[crux: If you can't capture the stone, ignoring it is an option.  A seems to be a stronger attack, but...]
;W[jk];B[jl];W[kl];B[il];W[km];B[lk]C[crux: This and the next couple of moves seem a bit panicky.  When something goes wrong, it's helpful to take a step back and consider the whole board again - locally you may have had a setback, but if you can find the biggest move on the board, you may still be in the game.  Don't make a bad situation worse by adding stones.]
;W[ll];B[ml];W[ln];B[kn]C[that cost me the game. Would there have been a possibility to secure the moyo i build down there and kill L8?]
;W[mm];B[in]LB[mj:C][nj:D][oj:E][qf:A][rn:B]C[crux: Again, small.  A and B seem much bigger.  I also don't know whether Black's center stones are lost or whether they can escape with C.  If not, forcing moves around D or E might be large.]
;W[pr]
(;B[or];W[pf];B[ph];W[rh];B[ri];W[rn];B[rm]C[crux: Ouch.  White got four big points in a row, and made Black respond every time.  I think here and with some of the center moves before you're being too protective over what you think is rightfully yours.]

C[TeeSushi [11k\]: thx

Have you noticed anything in my playing style that i should specifically work on (like invasions, life and death situations, Fuseki or anything)? Where do you think were the biggest mistakes?

Thx a lot for the Review :)

crux: All areas need work, but you were really being clobbered in the endgame because you were following your opponent's orders all the time.]
