C[Hello!  Thank you for taking a look at this game.  In this one, I am White.

rs: Hi, I will focus on Fuseki since I think it's there where u made the crucial mistakes that eventually did lead to your defeat.]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[oq];W[pe];B[ph]LB[oc:C][md:A][ne:B]
TR[qc]C[rs: Your approach move is alright. Here u have several options, you did choose the wrong marked one because it leads to a pressure situation against white, i.e. white can't develop efficently while black can use all his influence.

Good continuations are: A-C. I'd recommend B since it's just running out, i.e. you don't need much joseki knowledge. But A is best overall, but leads to complicated joseki.]
;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[ob];W[qg];B[qh]C[rs: Here u can see very good why your "joseki" is no real joseki. Your stones are pressed in while black makes territory or increases his influence on top right and the whole right side.]
;W[nd]C[rs: This move is actually too greedy, because it leaves a cutting point and your right group isn't settled yet. Simply O15 would have been better.]
;B[od];W[oe]C[rs: Here u can see the cutting point. If black takes his chance you'd be under heavy pressure, because you'll hardly able to save your group and the cut stone.]
;B[nc]C[rs: Black takes it easy which is understandable since he has an advantage now due to your bad joseki.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc]C[rs: Here it is important to keep going ahead to not only press down black as much as possible but also to build up influence, see var.

Going ahead if you can in a stone race like in your case is an important rule you might want to memorize.]
(;W[pk]C[rs: From what I said before it's obvious that this move is a mistake. You are too impatient resp. greedy...yoo wanted too much.]
;B[rg];W[qf];B[nh];W[qn]C[rs: That move is alright, maybe at R5 is even better, because it pressures black even more and is lighter.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[qk]TR[pn]C[rs: So far it's OK, but now - again - you are too impatient. Instead of stabilizing your whole group and closing the cutting point you play elsewhere and give black easy territory through the cut. Your next move should have been just at the marked spot.]
;W[jq];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[nm]C[I was happy to get a bit of a wall out of the situation, at least.]
;B[cj];W[oo]C[Probably a bad move.  I don't know what I was thinking here.

rs: Well, it was a mistake since you opponent could have been just played tenuki and gained some big momentum elsewhere while giving up just some points in his corner. But he did answer locally so no harm done eventually.]
;B[pp];W[rb]LB[kd:A]C[An attempt to get a bit of a base here.

rs: Well the attempt itself is good because your group there is indeed in potential danger. But a move into the center would be better since S18 doesn't settle the group. So play more like A.]
;B[kd]C[rs: Here u see the disaster that was caused by you not playing there earlier. Black threatens your hole group with that move and you must answer and later black has a move at F17 to basically  extend his territory.]
;W[mf];B[fq]C[rs: See the var., you were too much afraid here.]
(;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[hq];W[jo];B[gn]C[I wanted to cut G6 off, but I couldn't find a sequence to do it.  I feel the game is rapidly becoming a lost one.  Is there something I missed here?

rs: You can't cut G6 here from the rest of the group as far as I know.]
;W[cr]LB[fc:B][jc:A][cf:C][nq:D]C[rs: This move is a huge mistake, because it's too slow and gains too little considering there are still big points left on the board, like A-D.]
;B[ir];W[jr];B[er];W[cf];B[fc];W[db];B[hc]C[At this point, I feel there isn't much I can do.  All of his groups are safe except the stone at C10, which can easily run away to another living group.  What should I do?

Play like in var., you played too soft considering black's lead.]
(;W[mp]C[I];B[cg];W[dg];B[bg];W[bf];B[cl]C[This is just played good by black and here I close my review since the game is basically decided. You lost, because you didn't play some important moves at the beginning of the games. You didn't play these moves, because you were too impatient. Try to learn to recognise these moves and to play them even if other moves are tempting. Try to focus on Fuseki and you will get better.]
;W[bm];B[bl];W[ch];B[bh];W[dh];B[bi];W[em];B[ek]C[At this point, I'm out of ideas.  I tried to reduce him as best I could, as there's nothing to attack, and I knew I was behind by around 20 so I eventually resign.]

;W[no];B[mq];W[op];B[nq]C[I resigned at this point.  I see no way to make up the point deficit.

Thanks for looking over this game!])
(;W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lq];B[op];W[np]C[rs: It looks better but black still leads with a good chunk.]
))
(;W[eq];B[fp];W[cn];B[hq];W[jo];B[ho];W[ch];B[cl];W[jc];B[kc]
;W[hc]C[rs: White pressures black more and looks better this way. Don't fear the invasion at C3 since you can still jump out at E6 while black is still weak with two of his groups there.]
))
(;W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[ic];W[he]TR[cf][ef][jf][lf][dg][hg]C[rs: Black is pressed down and you are in the beginning at building a nice moyo for yourself around the marked area.]
