C[R: Hello, I am your reviewer my name is Ken, I will notate my comments like this, ("R:" means "remarks"). I hope that my thoughts give you a new perspective on your options in a game. Find a style which matches your personality. After reviewing your game I have the following for you to consider... is the move you are about to make helpful globally as well as locally... chase your opponent unless you are sure you can kill them... be sure your moves give you good strong shape so that you can attack with strenght.... find the biggest move on the board instead of a small local move.... read 3/4 moves ahead... Have at least 2 good moves in mind before placing a stone... these concepts should take you to 10k]

R: top seems worth more to B and B is not strong enough to kill W 2 stones. weakness began at move 161 for B. Most of the time it is better to chase and harass the opponent instead of "atetmpting" to kill them. Only go for the kill when you have read it out. see var at 175]

R: each time you do not respond to W in your area, gains you a point, so read out what is happening so that you gain points. see var]
