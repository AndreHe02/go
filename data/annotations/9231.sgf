C[Hagios: Hello, I'll be writing your review for you.];B[qd]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[oc];W[qj];B[qn];W[qg];B[jq]SQ[co]C[H: At this point, black has enclosed both corners, and white has only a small amount of cash.  In addition, black has extended along the side of the board which both the bottom corners want to occupy (envision an enclosure at the marked point for white, and you can see why).

Presently, this game is good for black.];W[hq]
(;B[dn]TR[jo]C[Not entirely sure if this was good direction. I was thinking about playing the ikken tobi (triangled) as well.

H: This is a bit strange, indeed.  I'd much prefer to jump to the marked point.]
;W[co]LB[jo:A]C[H: This move makes d6 look bad.  Helping white to solidify their corner should be avoided.  At this point, I would consider simply jumping at A and treat d6 lightly until it's useful later.]
;B[cn];W[do];B[dj]LB[cg:B][ch:A]C[H: This move leaves an opening starting at white A or B, which worries me, since white owns the upper-right corner.]
;W[cg];B[jo]C[H: Black still got this, so it's okay.];W[qp]
;B[qq]TR[pp]C[I had a feeling that closing white in the corner would give him too much and overconcentrate me. But I'm not sure about it now.

H: This damages r6, indeed.];W[pp];B[op];W[pn]C[H: This feels thin.]

;B[db];W[da];B[cb];W[ee];B[fd];W[ab];B[fb];W[bj]C[H: If we look at the board now, we see that white is causing problems everywhere.]
;B[of]LB[ld:A]C[H: This move feels a bit aimless.  Perhaps around A is better?]
;W[mc];B[me];W[jc];B[kd];W[ib]LB[ie:A]C[Is this a correct defense against my play?

H: This makes me think that white wants to jump at A to escape and run.]
;B[lb]C[H: Very sharp!];W[lc];B[mb];W[kc]C[H: Time to seal white in.]

(;B[kb]C[H: This is slow, better to prevent white from escaping.]

H: You started with a lead in the opening, but white was able to slowly chip away at it as you made tactical errors.  I strongly recommend studying tsumego and tesuji problems to help you find areas where you might find a sharp move; there were several points in the game where you left yourself open to attack, or failed to see where you could attack white.]
