(;W[eq]C[this was bad ...

Reviewer: It would be better to play E3 before the Q18-R17 exchange. If black chooses not to respond to E3 then white ends up with a very strong position in the lower left, but black also ends up with a very strong position in the top right.]

Playing down like this helps white make a base which is very valueable, but I would prefer K2. This really isn't such a terrible move.]

(;W[lc];B[je]C[H13 seems like a better way to cut than H15, however it is very difficult to read out. Cutting is definitely essential here. White cannot play passively and let black connect.

At this point though white is at a disadvantage because the center white stones are surrounded by black, and black has a LOT of liberties on the left side.]

Yes, a simple diagnoal move or just capturing the stone would have been better. This also leaves black good end game moves.]

C[had to take... black mistaked?

It looks possible that black can kill white here. So I wouldn't necessarily say it was a mistake. I have two variations showing how black could have played better.

If black seals white in and gets sente then black has done very well here even if it white lives.]
