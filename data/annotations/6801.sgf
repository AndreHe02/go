C[Nick [?\]: click on undo
amzolt [?\]: ok
amzolt [?\]: it's ok if you're black
Nick [?\]: somehow you set it up with me as black
Nick [?\]: let's go for it
amzolt [?\]: good]
(;B[qd]C[Nick [?\]: I guess we'll just see how you do..];W[qo]
C[amzolt [?\]: ok
Nick [?\]: ...and I'll give advice as we go
amzolt [?\]: ok];B[dq];W[dd]C[Nick [?\]: I see you played the 5-3 for your firswt move]
;B[pq]C[amzolt [?\]: yeah, thought I'd try it
Nick [?\]: cool];W[qq]TR[qk][op][nq]C[I'm guessing you're just experimenting around here, but this isn't a good move.  Look at how close your two white stones are, you aren't creating a lot of influence.  Also, they're so close to the side of the board that you aren't creating much territory.

The 5-3 starting point move usually focuses on gaining influence.  I've posted some of the more common moves in this situation with triangles.  Look at a Joseki Dictionary for more details.]
;B[pr];W[oq]C[I don't like this move.  That white stone is far too easily cut off from its support base.  Black now gets to attack both your stones on the left and right, keeping you on the defensive.]
;B[op];W[nq]C[Nick [?\]: I see you are not following the Nick method]
;B[pp]C[Nick [?\]: may I give one piece of advice?
amzolt [?\]: just "havin' fun"];W[qp]C[amzolt [?\]: server seems slow]
;B[jq];W[or];B[cf];W[bf]TR[ce]C[C15 is probably a safer bet. Unless you were trying to start a fight here I recommend you do that instead.]
;B[bg];W[be];B[ch];W[dg]TR[gc][od]C[This move doesn't have much purpose, I recommend building territory instead.]
;B[cg];W[pj];B[pm];W[qm];B[pn];W[qn]TR[ql]C[Go up instead.  Your connected well to the bottom stones, so you want to work instead on connecting with Q10.]
;B[oc];W[jd];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[cn];W[cl]
TR[dh]SQ[dg][dj]C[I'm not sure what you're doing here with this move.  What I recommend doing right here is strengthening you D10 and D13 stones, so that you can build territory in the upper left middle.]
;B[bl];W[af]C[You're not thinking big enough here.  All this does is gain you a few points in the top left.  Make a more important move here.]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[ag];W[df];B[lc];W[md];B[mc];W[pg];B[fc]C[You're in good shape here.  What you need to do now is focus on killing F17, and then you'll have lots of territory up top, as well as plenty of influence to start attacking the bottom.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[dm]TR[ec]C[You lost focus here.  You need to keep attacking his stones up top.]
;B[dc];W[qr];B[ib];W[jb];B[fo];W[kc]C[Nick [?\]: I just got done scrubbing the kitchen floor]
;B[lb]C[amzolt [?\]: hmmm
Nick [?\]: It's good to take a rest!];W[nc];B[nb];W[od];B[nd]
C[amzolt [?\]: oops
Nick [?\]: you want to take it back?];W[ld];B[pd]C[amzolt [?\]: no]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[pf]TR[mf]C[I would suggest N14 at this point.  Your Q15 group is connected well enough to Q13 so you don't really need the move you made.  N14 will help connect your two top groups, and keep black's top right group from moving into the middle.]
;B[mo];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[ol]C[Nick [?\]: Ah, the ever popular ladder]
;W[np];B[nm];W[ps];B[lq];W[mp];B[lp];W[mr];B[lr];W[ns]C[Wait to make this move for later in the game.  Right now you have the initiative, so make a bigger move.]
;B[nj];W[qs];B[fm];W[no];B[on];W[pl]SQ[ff][gf][hf][if][jf][kf]
[lf][mf][nf][fg][gg][hg][ig][jg][kg][lg][mg][fh][gh][hh][ih]
[jh][kh][lh][mh][fi][gi][hi][ii][ji][ki][li]C[It seems to me at this point in the game you were unsure how to proceed.  This move right here does little to attack black or build territory.  

Look at the area that I have marked with squares.  This should be your focus, you need to start surrounding it, with a mvoe like G15.  

Watch what black does for the next few moves.  He is building territory on the bottom part of the screen.  Observe how he does it, and try to apply it to your own games.]
;B[fk];W[ce];B[jj]C[See how much territory he secured with just those two moves?]
;W[ee];B[jm];W[nk]C[Nick [?\]: I would say the first part of the game is over]
;B[mk]C[amzolt [?\]: you'd know better than I
Nick [?\]: So, I am now using middle-game tactics];W[ok];B[nl]
;W[qk]C[Nick [?\]: It is important to know when the beginning part ends and the middle part starts]
;B[ng]C[amzolt [?\]: ok
amzolt [?\]: I think I may have lost the middle but I really can't tell]
;W[rl]C[Nick [?\]: you are quickly losing the middle];B[lf]
;W[ke];B[jg];W[fj];B[gj];W[hj]C[This stone right here is far too isolated from your main groups.  Not only are you going to lose it, but you're going to let black build up his groups in the process.]
;B[hi];W[ij];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[hl];B[gk];W[ii];B[hh];W[ig]
;B[ih];W[ek];B[ji];W[fl];B[gl];W[el];B[hm]C[amzolt [?\]: oops, havin' fun now
Nick [?\]: The problem with your group in the middle was that they were not connected to anything]
;W[oj];B[ni];W[oh];B[nh];W[oi];B[ge];W[fd]C[Nick [?\]: We are quickly coming to the end of the middle game]
;B[ec];W[ie];B[gd];W[jf];B[gg];W[hf];B[gf];W[he];B[hd];W[id]
;B[gc];W[ff];B[fh];W[eg];B[ei]C[It looks like you are cut off, but you can save your group with D11, see my variation.]

;W[eq];B[kg];W[kf];B[me];W[le];B[mg];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[ia]
;W[ja]C[Don't bother with this move, you aren't building territory or denying black much by doing it.  A move like M1 is better.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[fp]C[Nick [?\]: We are now in the end-game phase
amzolt [?\]: ok];W[ls];B[er];W[kr];B[jr];W[js];B[kq];W[ks];B[hr]

;W[kj];B[mh];W[li];B[mi];W[jk];B[lj]C[Here are 2 areas that I thought you were weak in.  First you would overplay your stones.  You'd play a stone too far from its support base.  When you're playing near your opponent, try and be more conservative next time, until you find the right balance.

Second, you need to focus in on what is the most important move at any given moment.  Take your time when playing, look all over the board for moves, and then compare those moves, trying to figure out how important each one is.  If you do this, you'll learn how to develop an overall strategy for each game you play.

Nick [?\]: Hopefully, as time goes by, you can pick up more ideas
