AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Good day!  I am Fletcher, your friendly reviewer.  Sorry that this review took longer than expected, but I'm in the military, and I had some unexpected interuptions!  So, I hope this is helpful.

Enjoy...................];W[pp];B[cg];W[cn]LB[fq:a][jc:b]C[It is much more common, and probably better to play either 'a' or 'b' here.  C5 is risky because it makes a black pincer around C9 very powerful.]

(;B[dm]LB[co:a][dn:b][cl:c][fp:d][fq:e][dk:f]C[This is an odd move.*  The most common responces for white C6 are a-f.  I've included some of the most common examples of these josekis in the variation.

I probably would have played at f.];W[dn];B[en];W[eo]
(;B[fo]C[Black's move up to here seem without direction.*  They are all outwardly directed, but then F5 offers up the e7 cut. Meanwhile the D4 stone is starting to feel lonely.  Better to play E4 here, keep pressure on the white group, but protect to bottom.]
;W[em];B[fn];W[dl]C[Ok, before we go on, let's think about blacks next move.  If you don't know, black played d9.  Now I want you to do something for me.  Sit back, and look at the whole board. Really look at it.
Now we'll have a makeshift quiz.*
1.  Are black's stones in the bottom left secure?
2.  Are white's stones on the left side secure?
3.  are all the "Big" points on the board taken?
4.  What would be the most common point to extend white's left side to?

Answers:
1.  white E5 would effectivly cut apart black's stones, destroying any chance for territory there.
2.  Sure these stones aren't fully stable, but since the stone at d7 is dead, White is pretty safe.
3.  By big points here, I mean the areas around the star points (Where you put the handicap stones.)  If you are ever looking for a place to play in the opening, I'd pick one of these, corners first, than side.
4.  to give a stable base to the white stones, c 11 is your best bet.]

(;W[ck]C[Atari the other way?*];B[dj];W[nc]TR[dj][ej][cg][dd]
LB[jc:a]C[Again, the pincer here would be dangerous for you.  Better at 'a'.  The marked stones are working fairly well to influence that area.  If black played around 'a', you'd have a dangerous moyo to contend with.  Better that you play there first.]
;B[me]C[Another strange move.  Refer to the previously mentioned Joseki.]
;W[oe];B[ep]C[Important, but wrong timing.  Top right is far more urgent now.  This move is not sente, so it lets black get another move in top right.]
;W[pe]C[now black's in trouble!];B[od]C[this move killed black's corner!! It forces o16, which locks these two stones in a white prison!]
;W[nd];B[ne]C[This doesn't do anything to help the two white stones...]
;W[kc];B[je];W[qd];B[pc]C[Too late to try to help them.];W[qc]
;B[qb];W[pb]TR[pc][pd][od]LB[qh:a]C[The shape the three marked stones are in is the worst shape three stones can get.  any 'L' shape should be avoided at all costs, because it means that  they are 'sharing liberties' in a sence.  More realistically, they are Taking each others liberites!!!!!

Oh, and white, your move is not neccesary.  better to extend here.  Black can't get two eyes, so as long as your outside stones don't get into trouble, Black is dead!  Therefore, extend to 'a'.  Grab some territory, and protect your murdering stones.]
;B[og];W[pg];B[ph];W[qg];B[ld]LB[oi:a]C[Not sente, because those three stones are dead.  Should have defended at 'a'.]

;W[qi]LB[pk:a][mj:b]C['A' much better, SpaceDog.  Those black stones aren't going anywhere, and now black can force you by playing there!  Plus it gives a cut at 'b' MUCH more meaning.]
;B[nh];W[og];B[mh];W[jp]C[Good point, But I'd play a line lower at k3]

(;B[jl]LB[fk:a]C[Too far down.  You're right to protect your center, but white can still come in at 'a', and this does nothing to protect that.    It would still be more valuable to attack the bottom right, though. *]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[gj];B[gl];W[fj];B[eh]C[Already connected... If you're worried, play c 10.  better shape, and has attack potentional.]
;W[pk];B[ol];W[qm];B[pm];W[pn];B[mo]C[I'm not sure what this stone is going for..]
;W[om];B[pl];W[ql];B[on]C[Dangerous!  White has his eyes on 'a'!!!  Your pushing him where he wants to go.]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[nl]LB[mk:a]C[Try to read ahead to what is going to happen.  black 'a' saves two stones, and forces white to capture, or else you can rescue your stones in atari, attack his three stones!]

;B[gi]C[There is no way that you can separate these stones, so all you are doing is making white stronger and yourself weaker.  Just think about this while looking at the upcoming plays.]

;B[db]C[Black, these stones are dead, so forget about them.  At some point later on in the game it might be possible to save them, but now they are hopless.  So leave them alone.  I know it's tough, but you must just tear yourself away, and forget.  You just guaranee their death by poking the body like this.  You lose liberties, and possible approach points to drag them out.]

Try to find places to play where you can make the other guy respond or get points.  'a' is good.  (black doesn't have very many good endgame points, because his only territory is in the middle.  That's the problem with the center; not much you can do FROM it, but it's real easy to poke at.]
