C[Babibo (Remi) :
Thanks for reviewing my game.

I am about 4-5k, and playing black here. White is 3-4k.
It was a tournament game, so we both had plenty of time to think (one hour each), and we both played our best (and the result might look pathetic to you)
I think I won this game on little fights, but I certainly made strategic mistakes. So I'm a bit disappointed not to have the correct global sense of the game. Could you help me improve it ?

Thanks !

Hello Remi,

As is my usual style, I will go through this game several times.  On the first time I will go through very quickly, like a kibitzer, and just express what I am thinking at the time.
On the second time I will go through much slower, probably about the speed you played or slightly slower, and discuss what I'm looking at.  
Finally, I will go through again 'cheating' by playing out variations, looking things up in joseki databases, etc.

The reason I go through several times is that each pass tells quite a different story.  The first pass gives what my intuition notices.  For instance, if the first pass notices a group under attack that you're not defending, then you need to concentrate more on looking for weak groups.  I don't do much reading in this pass, so frequently make mistakes.  I leave these mistakes there (with notes) so you can see where inutition is being overruled by reading.
--
The second pass gives something close to how I would play the game.  Reading is much more careful.
--
The final pass is intended principally to reduce the number of errors I make.  It ensures I suggest sensible choices of joseki and fuseki.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[There is, of course, nothing wrong with P3.  However, it will affect much of the fuseki development and so you should be quite familiar with 3-5 fuseki before playing it.

The komoku and hoshi lead to simpler fuseki.

Having said that, if you are familiar with a number of mokuhazushi games, it could lead to you getting an early fuseki lead.]
;W[dc];B[de]C[--
--
I would have played F3 instead, it seems to fit better with P3 to me]
;W[dh]C[I don't know what to do, so I play elsewhere
--
You really need to learn D12, it is the most common response to D15.  The normal continuation is G16 and that is what I would play, but C17 would be adequate here and is quite a lot simpler]

(;B[fq]
(;W[hq]C[After the game, we agreed that H3 was not a very good move if followed by F5 because of the stone at P3
--
I think H3 is okay.  I have had problems with this move when the P3 stone was closer (e.g. if B R4, W P4, B N3).]
;B[fo];W[cn];B[ip];W[iq];B[jp];W[hp]C[--
Normally white pushes (at K3) once more before H4.  This move gives black the option to play K3 and live in the corner.  Normally, pros decline this option and play H5 anyway but given P3, I would accept it here.]

(;B[ho];W[jq];B[kp];W[lq]LB[mo:A]C[Here, there is a joseki with A (N5), but I didn't like the shape I had with P3 if I played it.
--
You can also play M4
--
I think M4 (as you played in the game) is better];B[lp];W[mr]
LB[oo:C][mp:B][nq:A]C[Here, I only considered A or B. Since none is sente, I think C was better.
--
N2 should be M2 or possibly N3, I would play N3 now]
(;B[nq];W[qj];B[ec]C[Here, I want to stabilize my group.
--
This is okay, but I would prefer C17 (apart from G16, of course).  I would also force at N3 before the tenuki.  Leaving the aji on the board seems wrong.  If you force at N3 then you can attack R10 better without worrying about white playing N3 to fix shape in sente]

(;W[ed];B[dd];W[fc];B[eb];W[cc];B[fb];W[ee]
(;B[ef]C[Oops. Got away from the joseki.
--
I assume you're referring to G17 as joseki, but due to the ladder missing R10 (just), this move is about as good.]
;W[ff]C[--
--
F14 is an overplay, I would answer at D14 (as you did).  White should have played G16.]
;B[df];W[gc];B[gb];W[hc];B[hb]C[--
--
Better to force at B16 before crawling at H18.];W[ic];B[bd]
;W[bc];B[cd]C[--
D18 is better than C16.  White cannot escape at C16 anyway, and D18 greatly simplifies the semeai (and reduces ko threats)]
;W[ib];B[db];W[fg]C[Wow ! I am sente.
--
White gets a lot of thickness, but I think y ou get more territory.  The game looks good for you.]
;B[qh]C[I want to push white towards my wall, and I want to create fights in the area to make use of my wall. However, I don't like the Q16-R12 shape.
--
I think this jump is too big.  I was deciding between R14 and R13.
--
In hindsight, I think R12 is okay.  R4 is also okay];W[qn]LB[qm:A]
[qn:B][qo:C]C[Which move is better ? A, B, or C. And for what reasons ?
--
For white?  I would play B (where white played).  The reason is that R3 is open and so if black takes R8 then white has R3 to settle there.  R10 running away is somewhat useful to white given R14.  The tight formation at A would also be okay if white wished black to defend the lower side and immediatly attack at R14 (i.e. A gives sente).  C is also interesting, but handling shapes that weak is awkward.
--
Had the P3 area been more open, C would be a better move.];B[qp]
;W[oj]C[White is slow, but my wall is hard to use now, so I like what he did.
--
I agree.  Also, you must defend against R14 this move so white has sente.]
;B[oc]C[I try to take the corner, and compensate the big influence white has in front of me
--
I would have played Q17 or Q14.
--
I think you made the wrong defensive move here.  Ignoring my initial suggestions, how about P12? It protects the corner and highlights R8 again.  I think it is probably best]
;W[go]C[In this sequence, clearly, I was lucky.]
(;B[do]C[--
--
It is more common to play C3 and simply live in the corner.  Black ends up sacrificing one stone (F3) and getting either sente or good shape.
--
Also, taking the corner with the normal joseki gives the cutting point at D6 (see var)]
;W[co];B[dq];W[ep];B[fp]
(;W[cq];B[gn];W[gp];B[gr]C[No need to play there now. Perhaps bad timing.

G2 seems wrong to me

Had white attacked... black would have died];B[en]C[Lucky !
--
Indeed... your opponent is too cautious];W[of]C[--
I think P14 is too soft.  Also, white is not going to make a grand central moyo in this game, so it seems the wrong technique.]
;B[qf];W[nd];B[nc];W[md];B[mf]C[--
Too deep, you are ahead and so a lighter invasion is better.  how about N10?]

After G9, this often works.  It is the first thing I look for.]
;W[hk];B[eg]C[--
I would have played to kill H8 instead.  If that fails you can come back and take the _huge_ E13]

(;W[ge]C[--
Nice of white to give you it in sente.  I agree black could capture something there, but G15 is _much_ too small.]
;B[ck]C[This is awesome. In a few moves, I won the game.
Nothing really interesting from now.
--
agreed, the game is sealed now.  Apart from crazy mistakes, you cannot lose.]

Pros quite often play (more complex versions of) S5 just to force black to play J10.  In the commentaries they say "White asks for a reason to resign" or similar.  If you fail to spot J10 and they get points at S5 in sente, then they can come back, fix it and win.  Here I doubt even that would be enough to win, but I digress...]
;B[ij]C[White resigns

--
Overall, I don't think your strategic play is as bad as you make out.  There were a few moves of yours I disagree with (P17 and D5 come to mind first), but nothing major.

In some ways the bigger strategic errors were white's, such as going for a central moyo in a game where she was behind and you already had a wall, and playing too passive.]

Black can ignore O3 for now, or take O3.  Either seems quite good.  Tewari analysis says that M2 is fairly normal, N3 is fairly normal, but N2 is a yose move and playing it at move 22 is premature (best answered by tenuki).]
