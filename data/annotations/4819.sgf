C[Hi,

I played this game on IGS.  Against a 4k, but for some reason I fealt I got outplayed everywhere :(.  So any highlights on where I can improve will be helpful.  Thank-You!]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qf];W[cf]C[R14 is one step wider then R15.  So thats why I didnt' consider playing K17 right away.  And made a kakari instead.

The one step wider shimari might be faster, but it's also a bit weaker, that's why e splitting move on k17 is possible and i would recommend it. But a kakari might be another possibility]
;B[gc]C[This move I don't know what the answer is.  Playing C17 seemed to cause me grief because I get entrapped in corner.  And playing the B16 Joseki here didn't seem right because I wanted to keep the C17 option avaible to me for later with G17 being soo far away.


C 17 is a possible answer but if you don't like it. D10 is also possible, but c17 is a very big point.

G17 tries to prevent that you play the sliding move with b16, because the result would be better for black

i think black g17 is a bit passive. Because if you play d10 - Next...]

(;W[dj]TR[cc]C[- The corner is left open and if black takes the corner...]

(;B[jq]C[I wanted to help my one stone at Q4, so I decided to push from N3 side, I held back and not played M3 because I later didn't want to defend M3.

M3 wouldn't be a good move, as you already said.];W[mq]
(;B[gq];W[eq];B[cm]C[This move is a problem move for me, I don't know how to answer it.  I played C9 considering to pincer it, as C5 looked like odd shape, plus the C12 threat didn't look very nice either :(.]

(;W[ck]LB[ch:A]C[there is always the weakness on c12 left];B[bp]
;W[bq]C[This fealt wrong to me, but  playing C3 didn't seem right either.  So I choose lesser of two evils (I think).]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[br];W[bo];B[aq];W[cn];B[qn]LB[qp:A]C[I expected this, so I was going to pincer any approch black made.  So i decided with 2 point high pincer b/c of black formation above.  I wanted to cramp black up and keep my stone kinda high so it's easy to run.

This move isn't good
Just responding with A is probably best because the lower group is yet weak and is only waiting to be attacked.]
;W[pk];B[on]LB[qq:A]C[Just invade on A is enough];W[mo]C[After looking at it .. maybe this wasn't a good move?  should I have played S5 instead?]
;B[rp];W[qq];B[rq]C[I usually don't see this? how do I answer it?  Isn't it a bit early for end game?]

(;W[rr];B[qp];W[pq];B[po];W[qh]LB[go:A]C[correct shape?

this move is ok  but attacking somewhere around A is better.]
;B[of];W[pb]C[Probe to see what is important corner or side?]
;B[qb];W[oc];B[pd];W[lc]C[Right move? or should i play L17 to have more space to run out?

this is the right move, if you play one line above it would be too open]
;B[jc];W[le];B[nb]
(;W[kb]C[Strange answer I think, but connecting at P18 was just getting heavy and I didn't think that works.

if you answer like that, your exchange in the corner get useless and turns into a bad exchange.]

and this means that black has an advantage in this fight so best is to not start a fight in this situation.]
;W[em]C[good idea? or bad?  I later thought H15 would have been better Idea ... but after this I don't know :( Please make comments on anything you think I need to work on.  I am kinda lost in this game =.= he kinda lead me around like a puppy :(.]

Another critic is that you know very fancy things but you should really learn the basics (attack, defend, basic tesuji, weak groups, strong groups, walls and so on)

But I somehow like your style it's some kind of fighting and your timing is also very good.

If there are any questions left please ask me.

Sorry that it took so long but i was very busy lately.])
