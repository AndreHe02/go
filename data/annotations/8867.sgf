C[Hello! I am Dirk and my strength is around 5k on KGS. So I am still a beginner like you, however I will do my bests to provide some useful insights. 

In general, I think it is important for you to learn where to be agressive and fighting-oriented and where to not. In general you should be careful to invade or be agressive there where your oppponent has strong infleunce. Fights will likely turn out to your disadvantage there. On the other hand you can  enforce profit by playing agressively there where your influence is big. 

I think the above happened with your early invasion in the upper left. By invading you helped B to gain territory and thickness there, leaving yourself with a thin group that is easy to attack. However B luckily did not exploit this opportunity well. On the other side, I think you played too submissively around move 85. You could have made use of B's weak position here by playing some agressive moves. Perhaps you could work on your fighting skills to make you more confident in doing so.]
;B[dc]C[xxx [?\]: Hi];W[pp]C[yyy: Hi good game.];B[qd]C[xxx [?\]: good game!]
;W[cp];B[dj];W[qj]LB[kc:A][eq:C][iq:B]C[Move 6: After seeing the later development I guess I should have better stopped the double wing?

N: I think you could say that white around B or C would be better than R10 since they make white's stones face each other and work well together, while white around A would be better than R10 since it prevents black's stones from working well together. 

I think it depends mostly on style which one you choose. B and  C are more peaceful, A is more oriented towards a fighting game.]
;B[jd];W[ce]LB[eq:B][iq:A]C[Move 8: And probably should have taken the center in the bottom now?

Yes, I think you would better play around A or B here. Don't be impressed too much by black's 'double wing', since you can easily make one yourself as well. You should always be careful about invading a sphere of influence like black is constructing here. You will need some fighting to establish yourself here, and you are fighting at a disadvantage because of B's influence. Fighting at a disadvantage will make your opponent surround territory and build walls very easily. He becomes strong while you might get a weak group that is a burden for the rest of the game.

Remember that a sphere of influence or a moyo is far from territory yet, don't let it impress you too much, tempting you to invade prematurely and fight at a disadvantage.]
;B[de];W[df];B[cd];W[cg];B[be];W[ee]C[Move 14: Don't know what made me do this...

N: this move on itself I think is not very bad.];B[cf];W[bf]
LB[dg:A]C[N: This move looks bad. It adds no value to your group, while it adds one more cutting point, while with D13 and E14 you already have two major ones. You could perhaps have played A. It strengthens your group whilst making a little wall against B's D10 stone.]
;B[ce];W[eg]LB[ff:A][dg:C][dh:B]C[Don't use this move too easily. It may seem to nicely cover two cutting points at once, but it leaves B with two potentially severe peeps (A and B). E13 may have been better played at C, making a little wall against B's D10 stone. The E14 cutting point is not a problem since the ladder does not work (yet) for B.]
;B[cm]C[N: Remember what I wrote at the beginning of this invasion. You now have a thin and attackable group, while black has put a very solid group to surround the corner and score some points. I think this shows what can happen when you start a fight at a disadvantage. B can continue attacking your group and use that to become stronger, now or later in the game.]
;W[eo]LB[fd:C][gf:A][ei:B][eq:D]C[N: I think here it may have more priority to strengthen your weak group in the upper left. It is too heavy to sacrifice. A-C may help (maybe there are better options).

Locally E5 looks not good. It is far too high to get a stable group with corner territory. D would do that job nicely. D also is a nice base for further extensions along the bottom side.

Apart from that weak upper left group which to me seems top priority, it is indeed important to play in the lower left corner. It relieves your C4 stone from some serious pressure put on it by B C7.]
;B[kq];W[iq]LB[eq:A][fq:B]C[Good. But look at W E5, which would have been so much nicer placed at A or B now.]
;B[nq]
(;W[np]LB[oq:A]C[I don't think this one works. It leaves the way to the corner quite open for black. Its connection the Q4 stone has weaknesses which B could exploit in order to establish his group by fighting. 

I think most players would have played A. It seals off the corner, but still has some attacking quality, squeezing B into a base on the bottom side that is quite small. B might want to move out to the center, after which you can follow with a move like in the variation. B gets a small group in your sphere of influence, you get the corner and a good development towards territory on the right side.]
;B[oq];W[op]C[There you see you need one extra move to secure the connection, B gets a free move to strengthen his group.]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[pq];W[qq]C[I'm qafraid for the black cut at R4 here. I am not good at reading but I think it could at least lead to a scary fight for W.]
;B[jq];W[ip];B[jp];W[jo]C[Move 34: Here it was maybe the time to secure the right side?

N: I think R5 is big here... K5 serves very little purpose, while it introduces J5 as a future cutting point of concern.]
;B[qm]C[In principe this is not a good move by B. It is too close to your wall, and by chasing it from your R10 stone you could have gained a lot.

IF, however, your wall around Q4 would have been strong. But with the R4 cutting point I am afraid it is not.]
;W[pm]C[It looks a bit too agressive and fighting-oriented to me. 

In general you should watch out with trying to totally surround or kill an enemy group. If the enemy has no way out, things may quickly escalate into a very big fight with unsure outcome. With invasions it is often much better to gently chase your opponent out into the center, letting him escape while you are making territory or a nice wall for yourself.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[qo];W[qp];B[pn];W[on];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[qh];B[rh]LB[qg:A]C[The outcome however looks not too bad for white: black scores some points on the side, but you get a very nice wall and influence into the center.

It might be good here to expand further by A. A is a big point for Black and may become even bigger.]
;W[lp]LB[mq:A];B[mq];W[lq];B[lr];W[jr]C[Move 54: I simply missed about M-5

And K2 has no use. It is an endgame move that scores only a couple of points. Furthermore it's gote: after B L2 you defend at J2 and you lose the initiative.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[kp];W[ln]C[Good.];B[kr];W[ir]C[I think it's better here to tenuki (play elsewhere). Being able to take the initiative somewhere else is worth a few points.]
;B[lp]
(;W[mm]LB[lh:B][lk:A]C[Move 62: Did not want to get cut on the right to keep my wall effective. If this move was efficient I am completely unsure.

N: This move is very effective in protecting the cut. And I think the cut could need some protection.

But I do think there are more efficient moves, like A. This move protects against B running away after cutting, while using your nice walls to work towards territory in the center. I think it might even work with a move near B. Remember that it is most often not good to play close to strong walls, be it your own or your opponent's. Always try to play moves that serve more than one purpose.]
;B[jj]C[Move 63: This move puzzled me.

N: I think it is an effective move for B. It greatly reduces the efficiency of your walls, while K10 is hard to chase because B can make a loose connection with K13 or G10.]
;W[fm]LB[lc:C][oc:B][od:A]C[I understand the idea behind this move but I think it is not the best option locally. E7might be more interesting beause next to increasing your influence, it also puts some pressure on B's stone on the left.

More in general, I think there are bigger points on the board. B's top side is still very open and moves like A, B or C are big. Big points can often be found in open areas.]
;B[il]C[I don' t see the use of this move by B...];W[lj]C[Nice move since it works well together with your wall and at the same time puts some pressure on B's two stones. Still I think the top side is bigger.]
;B[nd]C[Looks like a good move for B with good timing. Now for W it will become much harder to invade the top right and B may make a lot of territory here. R13 may now also become more interesting for B.]
;W[ed]C[Good idea to try to strengthen your thin group. I think it should have been done earlier. B could have profited much from attacking this group, which I think he should have done much earlier as well.]
(;B[ec]C[As black I would respond with F17 to prevent W from intruding the top side.]
;W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[hc];B[jc]C[This looks like an ideal move for B combined with his stone at O16.]
;W[ie]C[Your group is now safe, and that relieves you from a big burden. Good strategy since now it now looks like a good plan to attack and chase (or even kill some of) blacks thin stones in the center. You could get a lot of profit from that.]
;B[qg]C[Indeed this looks like a big sente move for B.];W[pg]
;B[qf];W[pf];B[pe];W[nf]C[Maybe this move is too small and defensive. Launching an attack on blacks thin center stones in sente seems to be the best option. It looks big to play near F10, to split B's stones and make him have two groups to rescue. It also works towards connecting your groups.]
;B[jh]
(;W[lh]LB[jf:A][fj:B]C[I think this is too defensive as well. It is good to play a little agressive since you have much influence here (see my notes in the beginning). Around A or B look like options to me.]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[gg];W[gf]C[Here your upper group is getting into some trouble. It looks like it might take you effort to keep it alive. I think this may be the result of playing a little too reactive and passive.]
;B[ci]C[Big move for B, he now has a good chance to live.];W[fi]
;B[eh]C[Now B's groups have attained some strength, he can start attacking you...]
;W[fh]C[For some time I thought black could launch a life-or-death attack on your upper group, but now I think the shape might be OK.]
;B[fg];W[ei]C[Move 94: Here I was not sure if I should try to save and get something on the left or work on my center. I went for the center (more or less succesful.]

(;W[ji]C[Move 114: Again I decided for the center right. Now I am not sure if maybe pushing more to destroy blacks structure in the left center would have been better.

N: I think B is pretty much dead here... The cut at E7 looks dangerous but it can be prevented with W D8 (see var) and for the rest I see little way out for B. Or am I wrong?]
