C[Hi!

My name is Miguel Araujo and I played white on this game on Nova.gs. This was my first correspondence game and I really focused on reading whenever difficult situations arose. I think it was a quite even game.
I don't have any specific questions, but given the amount of time I spent in this game I think it is a good candidate for reviewing. I've marked my comments and thoughts during the game with "MA:".

Thanks,
Miguel

Hello!

Tapir here. I will do the review, my comments will be marked by "T:" I understand your pain with having to write questions, when you don't have a question in particular :) I am only a few stones stronger so don't take my comments as the gospel.

The game at times doesn't feel like a correspondence game with a lot of thinking time spent for each move. I would expect a calmer game, i.e. less difficult situations because more reading happened before they arise. 

Overall, Black had some strong positions but played too softly in the critical spots so you got away with situations that could have ended just as easily in big trouble.

Best Tapir.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[jp];W[qn]C[MA: I didn't know what the best answer was so I decided to treat this as an incomplete Kobayashi.

T: The reason you avoid the closer approaches in the Kobayashi fuseki is the K4 stone - it would help Black in any possible running fights after a pincer. Good decision.]
;B[po]
(;W[qk];B[qo];W[qh];B[qf];W[fq];B[fc];W[hc];B[df]C[MA: we both have enclosures on the adjacent corners so I guess neither of us wanted to let the other create a safe position facing that side.]

(;W[dj]C[MA: I chose a loose pincer to work as an extension.

T: I see. You really don't want the upper left corner, do you?]
;B[fe];W[kc]C[MA: I was ok sacrificing my corner stone at this point given the amount of aji is still had left.]
;B[mc];W[he];B[db]C[T: I don't like this move.];W[cg]C[MA: I wanted to solidify D10 in case he decided to approach at C6 and I figured this would be sente.

T: While the reasoning seems sound, you wrote about the aji in the corner just a few moves ago.]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[id];W[hd]C[MA: I never know when J17 is better in positions like this.

T: Me neither.]
(;B[dg];W[ch]
(;B[cp]C[MA: I was very surprised with this attachment as I don't think he can easily end in sente if he chooses the outside, and if he chooses the inside then I'm happy with my left side. (he deviated from the joseki at some point in this corner)

T: One doesn't always have to end in sente. Especially invasions rarely do so.]

;W[br];B[cm];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[em];W[fm]C[MA: should I push once more? I fear he will play B14 if I do so, and this variation seems more sentish.]

C[MA: I read a lot but I couldn't find a good attack against black's 3 weak groups if I cut at G15 now.
- the top has miai between B18 and H18 for life.
- the left group can live at B9]
(;W[gi]C[MA: I wanted to make him flee with either D14 or D7.]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[ge];W[eb]C[MA: I thought he would simply answer at E19 as being cut is painful.

T: "being cut is painful" - then why you ommitted G15?];B[hf]
;W[da]C[MA: I didn't want to give him H14 free];B[hb]
(;W[ea]C[MA: I believe this killed the corner.];B[hk];W[ke]
C[MA: I didn't want to create an heavy group, but I couldn't give him the whole top area.

T: Your reasoning is sound, but I believe it conflicts with the reasoning of earlier moves.]

(;B[ie]LB[da:3][ea:2][eb:1][pg:H][ph:D][ei:A][oi:F][pi:E][qi:G]
[pj:B][qj:C]SQ[id]C[T: At this point you spent three moves to kill the Black corner stones, while Black got very strong in an area that was dominated by White just some dozen moves earlier. Black eyes at A and B next - A would settle the last weak group Black has (+ make some territory), B-H exchange would start a whole board attack against the weak white group, even if White survives Black will most likely profit by turning the upper right corner to territory and gaining some useful moves in the center. 

Black spent too many moves locally as well. Especially the last one looks underachieving. J16 is safe without it and makes it difficult for White to make eyes, so Black would better play elsewhere in my opinion.]
;W[lp]LB[oh:B][fj:A]C[MA: I'm not sure if:
a) This should have been at the top, helping L15
b) M4 is the right invasion point on the bottom

T: I would consider A and B too. Locally I tend to play invasions on the third line - to make a base - or reductions on the fifth line. I rarely invade on the fourth line, this isn't necessarily correct, but that is what I do.]
;B[kn]LB[jo:A]C[T: Usually the better way to cut a knight's jump is at A. (See: http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsukekoshi)]

(;W[ko];B[jo];W[jn]C[MA: I read I could make my strength work to my favor, I don't know if M6 wasn't simply better.]
;B[ln]C[MA: This feels bad

T: For whom?];W[no];B[mp]C[T: Black plays as if he is afraid here. If you have a tesuji, you don't necessarily have to play it instantly.]
;W[mq]
(;B[lq]C[T: Too soft. This is the kind of move an invader plays to settle, not the invaded player when trying to attack the invading group.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[np]
(;B[kp];W[om]C[MA: I think I can be happy with the result but I don't know if P7 is the right connection.

T: P7 isn't connecting R6 and the invading group. It does the job for the invading group to run out. Good result for White.]

(;B[kg];W[lg]
(;B[lf];W[mf];B[lh];W[mg];B[mh]C[MA: He was greedy here.

T: All this fighting is so local and makes it easy for White to settle. Attacking works better on a large scale.]

;B[on];W[lr];B[kq];W[kr];B[nr];W[mr];B[nq];W[iq]C[MA: I knew J2 was safer but I thought this was better to attack later.

T: You can't really attack the black group, but Black threw away a lot of points here.]
;B[mp];W[mm];B[pm];W[lp];B[jr];W[jq];B[mp];W[ir];B[lp]C[MA: I whink I was safely ahead without O5 even if black got G8 for free.]

(;B[ro]C[MA: I didn't get this move.

T: This isn't a turn-based move. Looks like byo-yomi move.]
;W[pn];B[ok];W[oo];B[ol];W[nn]C[T: Now, White suddenly looks strong, and Black is under attack. Given the territorial advantage White already has the game is decided.]
;B[ri];W[kl]C[MA: he had to protect instead of S11, he resigned shortly after.]

;W[ii];B[kk]C[T: I count White 73+Komi, Black 64 like this. Well, this is probably safe enough. Still, if it is a correspondence game you have sufficient time to count at every move - you don't have to feel who is ahead.]

Although there is a weakness at P6 in this variation, Black has enough time to run out to the center, and when the center is closed on the right side, D will hurt.]
