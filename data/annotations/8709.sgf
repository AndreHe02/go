C[K: Let's start!
The global comment for the game is in the last move.
Enjoy, Andrea.];B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pc];B[iq];W[jd]LB[jd:B]
[qe:A]C[Question: How can i attack against this fuseki ? Or should i attack ?

K: for white, 3-4 point have a natural direction toward the corner enclosure A, and only later in the other direction B.
4-4 point instead have no set direction.

The last white move is a mistake, and black can take advantage of it taking away white direction of play while expanding in his!]
(;B[cf]TR[cp][iq]C[K: since there is a sort of enclosure on the lower side, from the chinese formation, it is ok to approach from this side too, but still inferior.]
;W[ch];B[fc];W[df];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bc]C[K: here you can think about tenuki.
An approach on the lower side is very big now, white can't afford to end the joseki in gote.]
(;W[bd]
(;B[ic]C[Question: Is this bad move ? or early ?

K: this strengthen white too much. Answering naturally leave black weaker.
White have no real way to attack the corner.];W[jc];B[ib];W[pf]
(;B[nc]TR[kb][mf]C[Question: How can i attack this area ?

K: attacking deep like this is good, because you can connect or jump away light. Just be prepared to sacrifice the first stone for a greater result, if it is needed.]

C[Question: Is it passive ?

K: this is a good move, it is solid, it make a good shape with j3 and you can use your thickness later to reduce or invade white's left side.]
;W[em]
(;B[qk]C[Question: is Q9 better ?

K: R9 is better, because if white invade in 3-3, R9 is better placed (see the 2 variations)]
(;W[mp]
(;B[nq]C[K: the same as before, too near the white stone, you help white making his stone more strong.]
;W[mq];B[np];W[jp];B[ip];W[jo];B[mo]C[Question: Bad ?

K: good, you press down white.
The hane at the head of two stones it is almost always a good move.]

;B[hs];W[jr];B[js]C[K: You told that your opponent played a strong fuseki against you, but I actually think that you have a stronger fuseki than him, and you player well your opening.
You got a bit lost in the middlegame, letting your opponent settling himself a bit too easily.
If you learn to avoid moves like J17 and O3, everything will be easier, because your attacks will be suddenly more effective and will give you more points while the battle runs, as a side effect.
Those are called "shoulder hits" (http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShoulderHit  and a few links at the bottom), and you usually use them against stones that are already strong, like in a moyo reduction (variation at move 75), never against a stone you want to attack.

I tried my best to be clear and not too dispersive, I hope it worked and that you like the review. If anything is confuse or unclear, feel free to call me on KGS when I am online, my nickname is kaiou.]

A and B are no good, because leave white with a single side and black with the bottom and the right side.
The only option left is a pincer.]
