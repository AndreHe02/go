C[Hello,
I was wondering if you could provide me some feedback on my opening moves. Do I focus too heavily on unnecessary reinforcements at the expense of white gaining territory unopposed? Thanks for any comments, and my apologies in advance if full games need to be provided in instead of just the opening 50.

John


It helps if the whole game is provided, but this is fine. 
                         Evan];B[qp]C[ight off the bat, I would say you should open up on the star. There is nothing wrong with opening on a 3-4 point, but a 4-4 point means more space.]
;W[dd]C[Heres a good chance to make the point. As of now, white has more influence. The computer is winning by 8.5 moku. However, it's not really a big deal. Just be aware of it.]
;B[pd];W[dq]C[Tie. For the next move consider O-3. It is closer to the edge, and it's still not too vulnerable.]

(;B[oo];W[hp];B[qj]C[Again, try to take the 4th line, not the 3rd. The 3rd is more useful in the corners and in closer combat.]
