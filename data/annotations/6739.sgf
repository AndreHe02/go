C[Okay, my name is Johnny5, and I'll be reviewing your match.  As I've looked over it, I noticed a number of reading errors, and some other minor things, but I will mention those as I go.  And so we start.]
;B[pd]C[mineteaser: hello
danieleff: Hi!];W[pq];B[dc];W[cp]C[Another possibility would be K3 or K4.]

(;B[pj]C[This move is not necessarily the biggest on the board.  It's not a bad move, but there are better moves at this point.  Please see the variations for alternate plays.]
;W[jq]C[See how one of white's first moves is to take that central point in his group?]
;B[jd];W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[Should I have pincered the white stone at M17 instead?

Yes, a pincer would have worked better with your other stones I think.  Please see the variation.]
;W[nd]SQ[lc][qf][pg][qg]C[The typical play is marked.  See possible variations.]

;B[qb];W[pa];B[nb]C[I thought I had gotten him with that move, but I was wrong.

Yes, you still needed a play at R19.];W[mb];B[qa];W[na];B[ci]
;W[ce]
(;B[bd]SQ[cg]C[Is that a good response to white's stone?

The better response is to support your stone at C11 with a pincer.]
;W[ee]
(;B[dd]SQ[df]C[Uneseccary move.  Better to play at D14 here.]
;W[dg];B[de];W[df];B[cf]TR[ce][df][dg]C[Reading mistake here.  As you know, this turned into a ladder.

Typically when there is a formation like this a ladder will be formed if you cut the triangled stones.  Watch for this in your other games.  If you take the time, you will see where it is a bad idea to cut.]
;W[bf];B[cg];W[ch];B[bg];W[bh];B[gd]C[This I feel was a good and necessary play.]
;W[eh]C[gote for w.]
(;B[ck]C[This is probably a little too slow.  Usually a 2 space jump is safe in these situations.]
;W[fq];B[cn];W[di];B[be]C[Save plays like this incase a ko fight appears later in the game like it does in this one.]

(;B[qn]C[I played here to prevent stones R5 and S5 from being in atari and losing the potential eye at Q5.

At this point it actually doesn't really matter.  The only time you really want to prevent an eye is when you are trying to kill a group that is trying to live in your territory.  

There is not really any way for you to kill this group so the move is better played elsewhere.  This could also be saved for ko threats later.]
;W[ql];B[rk];W[rl];B[sl];W[sm]C[This group is alive, no point trying to kill it.]
;B[sk];W[rm]SQ[qk]C[The move is here.];B[pk];W[oq];B[nq];W[np]
;B[mp];W[no];B[oo];W[nn];B[on];W[mq];B[nm];W[nr]C[The cut became useless.]
;B[lo];W[qk]C[Best to let the stones die and save your territory.]

(;B[oi]TR[pj][pk][nm][pm][on][pn][qn][oo][qo][ro][op][pp]C[Should I have extended the atari stone instead?

It's hard to say at this point.  By extending rather than playing the hane, you put your lower group in a risky position, and it's still very unlikely that you will actually kill this group of stones.]

Yes, thankfully your opponent didn't notice either.];B[cm];W[an]

This is alive.  White simply made a mistake.  This will not be successful in other games.]
