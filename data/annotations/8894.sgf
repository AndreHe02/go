C[To the reviewer:
Dear reviewer :)

I sent you a game I won, but it is because I was very lucky in the endgame, my opponent did not protect his stones correctly.
I should have loose it by around 10 points.

I can see one obvious mistake, my move 46 in B5 does not work because my opponent can cut.
I added other few questions about moves I am not really sure about.

Do you see bad moves / errors I made in this game ?

Thanks for your time

-Hi there BurgerKing,

I saw a few mistakes. More importantly than single moves you did, I think some of the thoughts behind your moves were mistaken. A lot of the times like in the opening of top left, you had a good idea but didn't solidify yourself first and didn't think what I'm going to get by attacking. You also had a big wall but didn't use it correctly. If you read any books, I would recommend "Fundamentals of Go" by Toshiro Kageyama. Move 46 was a mistake but it wasn't as huge as you think. Again, I think you should focus more on your thought process rather than a single move right now. I left some comments and other moves you could have made in places, if you have any more questions you can email me! 

Good luck!

What do you think of this kind of move ?
I use it again

-This is not a move you use unless you really need to connect. It's not something you want to rely on, especially if your stones could have been better in another way. This makes B stronger and while you do connect, you're usually still weak.]

Here I think I  made a mistake, because my opponent can cut in C3

Is this move a mistake ?
it worked well in this game but I guess my opponent's move in N4 was not the best.

-This move is a mistake. You should have just connected the peep at this moment. You were supposed to be the one attacking and now you're connecting under. B made a mistake though.]

Here I was not completely sure if my opponent could cut or not.
But I decided to invade the right border because it has a lot of potential for my opponent.
Should I have protect the cut ?

-I don't think he can cut but it's a bit complex for your level to read. But you shouldn't just leave something big like that to chance or because you think it's too difficult to read on both sides. The right side is also big though.]
