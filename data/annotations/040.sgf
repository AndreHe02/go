(;W[qm]C[I am not very good at analysing openings, but i would have considered finishing the joseki in NE by playing w j17. Also a following b play at k4 could have been balanced with w d10, extending d16 in both directions.

Not playing j17 could be justified to attack b or to take another big point. w r7 just seems too slow, i may have played k4 to restrict b shimari in its best direction, and to develop q4.

balance of territory evals to b = 15(NE) + 10(SE) = 25, w = 0
w influence does not compensate the deficit];B[nq]C[Here as b i would have played on the upper side, at j17 or c14 then around j17.

If i were to play on the lower side i would have calmly extended from the shimari at k4.]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[lp]C[w corner does not seem to be so strong as w can push b o3 against it. I would extend on S side as soon as possible.]
;B[nn];W[ln]C[i would not have waited this long to play h3, giving b the opportunity to play there before.]

(;B[mo]C[fortunately b "loose" a stone];W[hq]
(;B[pq]C[b q3 is very kind. w is weak in the corner and b just gained a strong wall. I would cut at r5.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pr]C[b can take the corner (or a large E side) with r4 ?];W[qr];B[fq]
C[this is small, there is still the unfinished joseki in N side

during the last few plays
- w has gained territory (5) in SE
- w has limited b extension on S side from his SW shimari

- w has isolated a b weak group on S side, hoping to gain territory on E side and/or power in the center.
- b has gained territory (5) in SW

i think b is still leading due to the unfinished joseki on N side];W[mr]
;B[op];W[po]C[w gains 10 points];B[lo];W[ko];B[fc]C[i think this is not the best point, as it allows w to extend from his o17 stones, and to finish the unfinished joseki]
;W[hc]C[i prefer j17, h17 being too close from f17 if b extends to f15]

(;B[fe];W[df];B[hd]C[b allows w to strengthen (one more time)
he should cut w h17 from the o17 stones!];W[ic]
(;B[dc]C[as b has enforced his f17 group, it might be possible for him to take the corner straight on with c17 (this is not guaranteed, i show a possible sequence)]
;W[cc];B[ed];W[de];B[db];W[cj]C[again b has strengthen white. The balance of territory is now
b: 15(NE) 15(SW)
w: 12(SE) 10(NW) 5(S) 5?(N)

b has two groups not really set, w may still suffer an attack on N side
The game is now fair]
(;B[mq]C[it is still time for b to attack w N side,
for example with l17
there is also b c12 to reduce w L side.
b n3 is not very useful.];W[lr];B[pj]C[i prefer r10 (on E side), and l17 globally]
;W[id]C[good, defend the weak group and make territory.
now w has no weak group, except perhaps a b invasion at c12 ?

As b q10 gains "no" territory (too high with respect to r7), w is leading both territorially and in influence]
;B[cb];W[bc];B[iq];W[ip];B[gq];W[hr];B[ml]C[??];W[fg]C[on this side i believe w c7 is better]
;B[pl]C[?????];W[cm];B[kn]
(;W[jn]C[w k5 is also possible, gaining sente to enlarge w influence zone on W side]
;B[km];W[jm]
(;B[kl];W[jl];B[go]C[b seems afraid to go too far]
(;W[ho]C[i think w should not be afraid from b cut at k5 (see variation move w a1). It would be better to play w e7, calmly but surely widening w territory]

(;W[di]C[w cannot gain everything. a move at c11 would save more. w c7 is a very important stone to reduce b side.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[bk]C[w has gained 4 points around d12 and lost 6 points around a12, b has gained 20 points around c7. b is leading.

w must make his best from his center, and reduce as much as possible b prospects on E side.

It seems imperative to close b f15 but it seems also difficult to do it. w h14 might work.]
;W[gn]C[gote ?];B[eo]C[thank you b];W[he];B[gf]C[:-)
some stones are important, others not
b made the good choice];W[ge];B[ff];W[ej];B[dk];W[hf];B[gg]C[?? w is pushing b into territory]
;W[gd];B[bb];W[be]C[o13 more important ?];B[eg];W[dg];B[fh];W[eh]C[what is the aim of this stone ?]
;B[hh];W[ih];B[oh]C[as b i would play more deeply (m12), in order to ruin w hopes of territory in the center. b p12 seems to make territory on the side, however the side is still open at r7.]
;W[mh];B[ng];W[mg]C[again b has forced w to make territory :)];B[ql]C[in compensation b takes the E side (~20)]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rm];B[pm];W[pn];B[rj];W[nh]C[?? the center still needs consolidation (w j11 ?)

balance of territory is
b: 15(NE) 15(E) 6(S) 41(SW) 3(NW) = 80
w: 14(SE) 13(S) 17?(C) 10(NW) 16(N) = 70

;B[oj];W[ni];B[lk];W[lj];B[ll];W[ef];B[fg];W[tt];B[tt];W[tt];C[as a final commentary i would say that w plays in a hopeful spirit. After a difficult start b allowed w to catch up then to lead by concreting w hopes. However a mistake of w at d11, and the use of it by b, lost the game for w. Again at the end a wrong evaluation of w center as "territory" destroyed the last w hopes.

So for w, do not take influence areas as territories, and for b, try to play more agressively if w allows you to cut his groups.]

(;W[ci]C[balance of territory would be
b: 15(NE) ?(E) 6(S) 23(SW) 3(NW) = 47
w: 12(SE) 13(S) 10?(C) 15(NW) 12?(N) = 62


next important things are the ?, and especially the frontier between the black's ? and the white's ? around n11.]
