AB[pd][dp]C[Hello reviewer !

I'm a french 3K (maybe a little underrated : I am KGS 2 dan), and my opponent is 1K. It's a tournament game - 1 hour each. I'm black. I won the game by 2 points.

You'll see questions along the game. I'm wondering what we did wrong. Please give me your thoughts and ideas about the game, about white's moves as black's, since I intend to forward the review to the other player too.
I'm sorry to say I can't remember what was played after move 80. I hope there is enough to say about the opening.


semelis: the opening is the most complex part, I'll give my thoughs, but don't think they are absloute.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[cn];B[de];W[cg];B[ef]LB[gc:A][cd:B][eg:C]C[-->: 
Taking into account left side of the board, the most often move here by white is A, B is also very common anc C a little less.
See variation.]
(;W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[dh]C[probably slow. What do U think ?

-->: 
Only move that comes to mind. It's joseki.
Again, looking only at the left side of the board, I've found a chinese pro game, see the variation played. In the pro game the upper rigth stone is white (an even game)  and colors are reversed.
Players were Zhao Xhelun and Kim Seunjun in the 6th chinese city league A round 7 , 2004-06-03]

(;W[fp]LB[dn:B][eo:A]C[I played B, because I don't like A (see var). Do U think A is playable ?

-->: I think so, specially after seeing the similar pro game showed before.]
;B[dn]LB[eo:A];W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[ep];W[bq];B[dk];W[em];B[fm]
;W[el];B[fq]LB[gn:A]C[It doesn't seem to be joseki.

-->: I've found a Tengen title game between Sonoda and Shimamura from 1977-12-01 where this is played. Only that black now protects at A instead of the hane under.
So, it can't be that bad.];W[nc];B[fk]TR[gn]LB[gk:A]C[I regretted this move instantly. My idea was to sacrifice D9 and get a big wall so as to simplify the game, but the wall is weak. What do U think ?

-->: Even with the cut protected, the pro played at A -and much later. There are a lot of holes and cuts here now. The hane below and this wall idea seem contradictory as the cut will be a weaknes.]
;W[fl];B[gl]
(;W[cl]C[Phew !

-->: The vairation you show seems ok for black though.];B[ek]
C[-->: Wrong direction. D9 stone is not important, specially after C8 has been played.
If black's interested in the left side C9 seems better, but the cuts to the center are more important I think.]
;W[ck]C[big but slow, I think

-->: Yes, it gives you the chance to protect some cut.];B[pf]
TR[gk]C[-->: The marked cut worries me, but this is also big.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kd]TR[ic]LB[kc:A][ld:B]C[-->: The standard joseki move is at A. If white wants to play high for some reason, then it's B.
Now the positiioin is weaker, and black can take profit atacking at the triangled point.]
;B[mq]LB[qj:A][qq:B][gk:C]C[I like this move.

-->:
I'm not sure if it's the best.
I would play at the right side, or at the 3-3 point or solidfy at the center: so A, B or C in order of preference.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[qn]C[Suddenly, the game looks very promising for black. Was white too soft ?

-->: I don't think so, it's a 2 stone game, and black has not make any big mistake, so there's still an advantage. Maybe you are overestimating the left wall, that's full of cuts.]
;B[qp]LB[on:A]C[To me, A looks like the only move

-->: For white ? It's the more simple, but atacking the weak spots in the left wall seems also possible. And white has to take the initiative to catch up with black.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[gm];B[fn];W[hl];B[gk];W[hp];B[go];W[fr];B[hq]
C[Was this a good idea ? I can't tell...

-->: The alternatives seem not good.];W[eq];B[iq];W[ip]
(;B[jq];W[hn];B[ho]
(;W[hk]C[-->: Might has been soft, look at the variations I propose.]
;B[jn]C[probably not a good idea. The remaining aji prevented a cut at C4-D2 later (see variation when white passes)

-->: I agree.]
(;W[hj]C[Not sure this was the move played by white.

-->: Seems reasonable.];B[ch];W[kl];B[pl]LB[rl:A][rm:B][ml:C]
[hh:D][ic:E]C[Any other suggestion on how to take advantage of white's weaknesses ?

-->:

Complicated.

I don't know if t's better to begin with an attack at the toop with E and see how the fight at the top develops or to attack immediately.

In the later case I would have a hard time decing between D -that would help invading at the top-, C -that can help to build up the lower side while attacking the right or even make the placements at A or B a real danger-.

A direct attack agains the 2 stones seems also possible, but I prefer the previous approaches.]

(;B[rj]C[I don't think this is the good side for the hane.

-->: I give some variations about how I think the game could proceed, but probably there others better.]
;W[qj];B[rh];W[pi];B[qh];W[rk]C[This is the key moment of the game. I really didn't know how to take profit out of white's weak group in the center.

I didn't feel like taking the S10 stone, which was probably sente and would have launched a good attack on the white side group. Apart from this move, do U have any suggestion on how I should continue this game ?

-->: The problem I see here is that allowing white to get the marked stone and a way to the center contradicts the 4 stones invested in cuting white first, so the attack on the center group becomes more difficult.

Taking the S10 stone is not that good, attacking from the corner is better I think.
See the variations I give before.];B[kj]LB[hf:A]C[I can't remember what happened next. I didn't profit at all from this attack, so I played the yose, and won by 2 points (I had the opportunity to play C10, R18 and B18 !

-->: This move is the "killing" move, but I don't think that's possible, so attacking from the top to help the invasion seems beter.

In the end, white made about 10 points in the center (I could not find any way to invade the top, by the way - do U see any way ?). I simply played A (answered by H16).

-->: If white is not strong in the center invading at H17 as pointed out before ought to be possible.

Thanks a lot !!!!!

-->: You are welcome, I hope it has helped a little bit.];W[kn]
