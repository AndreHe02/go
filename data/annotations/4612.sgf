;B[pc]C[hi reviewer

i am white/yahiko

thx for commenting

it was a close game.without komi i would have lost

second move is a missclick...so please dont be confused

B: Hi Im Baga, approximately 11kyu by the new KGS ratings.]

(;W[or]C[UNDO])
(;W[dq]C[B:Firstly a global comment on your game. You seem to have a good grip on the many different issues you must weigh in considering your moves. In fact, I would have easily mistaken this game as between 17-20kyus if i didnt know better. 

What you LACK however is the preserverance to follow through on an idea. You try to form dozens of little strategies , a new thought/strategy with every new move. Instead you should have fewer strategies and allow more moves (per strategy) to build them up. You understand?]

;B[co]
(;W[dm]C[B: Id go for C7 instead. Thats a stone in enemy territory. I dont see why you should go in high. By going in high you have the potential to reduce enemy territory, but you have a real chance of forming territory if you go in low. 

Alternatively, a solid B10 is a good invasion too. But not the best move I think.]
;B[cq]
(;W[cr]C[B: Maybe D4 would be better. More possibilities and also provides a possible future support for the lone D7 stone.]
;B[br];W[dr];B[dp];W[bq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[ar]C[B: You'd notice how the progression of events has lead to you being enclosed in the corner and bottom side. This is not in and of itself a bad thing. But you should try to be aware of it beforehand to finetune your strategy.]
;B[ap]C[B: Here giving up the two stones would seem more advisable. 
If you would play G3 or maybe even E4. You get that group its base and secure the bottom. Otherwise the D4 stone sticking out seriously hampers your prospects.]
;W[bs];B[fp]C[here i played elsewhere because the corner is alive]
;W[of]C[now i think: i should have made a "faster" move

e16 or d10.would this be good?

B: That D7 stone does look weak... C13 maybe. Or if you want to ignore the issue for now, i personally wouldnt go for E16, but maybe E17

E16 is good when the opposite side of the board (Top right) is open. But here it seems pointless in territory, or in future prospects.]
;B[nf];W[pj];B[nq];W[lq]C[B: Better to just secure the corner I think. You can also spill into his territory from the D2 group. Doing it from both sides is wasteful]
;B[op];W[oo];B[no];W[po];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[nr]C[in this situation i didnt know what to play
so i tried to make more territory at the bottom

B: It looks weak. Try J3, make a solid base? Or do something on the relatively open left side... or build the right side outwards by O6 ( will have to think ahead a bit so M3 survives easily though)]
;B[ql];W[ol];B[qj];W[qi];B[rj];W[pk];B[qk];W[pi];B[qn];W[rn]
;B[rm]C[i wanted to seperate blacks stones
now i think s5 is better

B: Without a doubt.];W[pm];B[ro];W[qp];B[pn];W[on];B[mo];W[qm]
;B[sn];W[qo];B[rn];W[sl]C[B:Seems you are too intent on killing.]
;B[rl];W[ri]C[i thought i had to enclose black stones because they were already alive

if w:t9 then b:s4
right?];B[sk];W[rp];B[qr];W[or];B[oq];W[mp];B[np];W[lp];B[lo]
;W[mr];B[jo];W[rr]C[i thought the white group at the bottom would be alive
so i played elsewhere];B[fc];W[ed]C[i didnt know how to attack two stones....so i tried

B:Its pretty strong. Best to let him keep it. C10 maybe?];B[ec]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[cc]C[i wasnt sure if this cut was good...
i thought it could work to get the side or a little bit of the corner]
;B[bc]
(;W[cb]C[i thought of c15 too

B: C15 better.];B[be];W[ce];B[bd];W[df];B[cf];W[de]C[B: Bad shape isnt it? C15 would give you more control and reinforcements for the D7 stone.]
;B[cg];W[eh];B[nh];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi]C[B: I believe thats already dead.]
;W[bb];B[ab];W[ac]C[i thought i could kill the four stones]
;B[ad];W[af];B[bf];W[ag];B[db];W[bj];B[bg];W[cj];B[hd];W[ai]
C[B: wasting moves. 
Better to play J3 or something and get some free territory.]
;B[ah];W[gd];B[gc];W[hc]C[by this....i wanted to get a group in his territory

B: Your play seems desperate. Thats what happens when you think too many strategies.]
;B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[he];B[id];W[fe];B[em];W[en]C[is hane here ok?

B: I wouldnt. But it worked out ok.];B[dn];W[fm]C[B: E8 better...makes you territory for free.]
;B[el];W[fl]C[here i thought that i could only get stronger in the centre]
;B[ek];W[cl]C[i wanted to get two eyes there];B[fn];W[eo];B[fo]
;W[cn];B[do];W[bn];B[dl];W[cm];B[fk];W[il]C[actually i wanted to play h8 to keep the two stones alive.
j8 was by accident...so i had to try];B[gl];W[ld]C[at that time i couldnt imagine i would  get all the upper side
 i think black made some big mistakes there];B[lc];W[mc];B[md]
;W[nc]C[there i planned to connect to my white stones on the left]
;B[le];W[pb];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[lb];B[kd];W[kc];B[ld];W[kb]
C[B: Instead of L18  ( a one-pointer) Id go for J3];B[ha];W[ii]
C[for influence... i thought

B: Influence is rather pointless near the endgame when most groups/stones are alive. You could make the same or similar move but it would be to increase your territory and/or reduce his, but NOT for influence.]
;B[jg];W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[kp];W[jq];B[hp];W[kq]C[B: H3 better.]
;B[ko];W[hq];B[gq];W[gr];B[fr];W[eq]C[i like this one

B: Nice.];B[ep];W[fq];B[gp];W[fs]C[i thought of g1

Technically here it probably doesnt matter. But as a general principle of play...why are you giving your opponent a free ko-threat? H2 accomplishes the same thing with no net loss of points and no ko threat.]
;B[im];W[jm]C[i didnt want to make territory anymore
i thought i would win if i could prevent black from making territory in centre
so i tried my best];B[in];W[jl];B[ji];W[gk];B[hk];W[gj];B[hl]
;W[ik];B[hg];W[fj];B[fg];W[dg];B[ca]C[this one wasnt important of black i think]

thanks for the comment
i will learn from it^^

B: Good game. Concentrate more of your moves in pursuit of fewer ideas, and you should rise fast.

Best of Luck,
