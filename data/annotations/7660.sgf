AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello, Andrew!

I am Bernd, 1k in Germany, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

In this game you made some mistakes of the same kind, so it is very suitable for review. By closing one gap of knowledge you might well increase in strength soon. As the main issue I will explain to you one very important strategic concept which is important in every game of go:

Play close to weakness, play away from strength.];W[nc];B[qf]
;W[fc];B[jc]C[Here I try to double pincer.

Hon: Good move.];W[cf]C[He double kakaris my corner.];B[df]
C[Is this the correct side to block from? I thought it would get a big wall with which to attack the F17 stone.

Hon: It's possible. 

But you have to know beforehand, that if you touch a stone, it will usually get stronger. If white gets strong on the left side, that side will be devalued for you later (explanation will follow). But there is no problem with this, if you build up the rest of the board by attacking the two stones on the upper side.]
;W[dg];B[ef];W[cc]C[I wasn't sure what to do here.

Hon: Since you told me what your plan was, there is only one move, right?]
;B[dc]C[Hon: And there it is. :-)];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bg]
C[Hon: So far it was joseki, and your plan seems to work out.]
(;B[gd]C[I decided that I had to block the F17 stone.

Hon: This is a defensive move. Your plan was to attack, wo why are you afraid that F17 might move?

In fact you want the stone to move. Because it will be a weak stone, and hunting him will help you in every other part of the board.

Capturing this stone small like this, for something around 10 points, in gote, is simply too small. White has the same amount of points - probably more - in the upper left corner!]
(;W[cn]C[Hon: Your opponent develops from his strong group in the upper left, but if you answer correctly, he will not be able to make a lot of points here. Of course it is hard for white to find a good move in a handicap situation, but here he is playing close to his own strength.]
(;B[cl]C[I pincer.

Hon: In most cases it is not good to pincer in front of a strong enemy group. Since White is alive here anyway and you will never either harm him or make many points here, you should rather go on developing the rest of the board.

Here you try to play close to his strength, giving him the chance to make good use of his position in the upper left.]
(;W[fq]C[White double kakaris again.

Hon: I would have jumped out in his place.];B[dn];W[dm]
(;B[co];W[cm]C[Is there a joseki for this?

Hon: Getting C8 destroyed like this can not be joseki.

But if you play this, then you must be ready to dismiss C8 for now ...]
(;B[ch]C[I nozoki.];W[cg];B[dj]C[Hon: Now you start to play in two places at the same time, while you have weak groups on the left side and in the corner. You maybe thought you were attacking, but rather you were helping white on his mission here.]
;W[en];B[do]
(;W[dr];B[fp];W[gq];B[em];W[dl];B[dk]
(;W[ck];B[cj];W[bl]C[Hon: Instead white lives small on the left side, which was small to begin with.]
;B[el]C[I decided this result was acceptable.

Hon: Yes. White was being nice to you. He is compressed and weak and small on the left side, while you get center influence.]
;W[fn]
(;B[go]C[Hon: This is bad shape.]
(;W[bj];B[gm]C[I decide that keeping white's two E6 cutting stones surrounded is the most important thing to do.

Hon: I think, white's move at B10 was cowardly, and capturing these stones is good for you.]
;W[ek]C[White cuts.

Hon: Too late.]
(;B[ei]C[Hon: Missed a good chance.];W[fk];B[gl];W[fi];B[eh]
;W[eg];B[fh];W[gi]
(;B[fj]C[Hon: No!];W[gk];B[fg]
(;W[nq];B[qn]C[I decide to avoid any more double kakaris.

Hon: The more important point is that since his group in the lower left is alive, a pincer would have little effect. It is just the same as before on the left side: Make the opponent play close to living groups, but don't play there yourself!]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[bi]C[Hon: What is white doing? Why is this move big now?]
(;B[ej]C[Hon: This move weakens his group further, but I think, you should rather play in the upper right now.]
;W[fb];B[fa];W[jp];B[pj];W[lc]C[Hon: White should have taken Q18 instead.]
(;B[je]C[Hon: What are you doing? Defending your weak wall? ;-)]
(;W[no];B[kj]C[I decide to play a move that will give all-around influence.

Hon: Q18.];W[ql]
(;B[qk]C[Hon: I think, this move is not good.];W[pl]LB[qi:B]
[oj:A]C[Hon: You just help him out while weakening your corner. Your stones fight against each other. What is more, you have weakpoints at A and B now. 

Attaching with a move like R9 is good in special cases, but normally it is bad shape for black.]
;B[on];W[pq]
(;B[op];W[oq];B[np];W[mp];B[mo];W[lp];B[mn]C[Hon: Okay, but this shape also has its merit. R8 should die now, you are very strong, and white's lower side, which had lost its value for you anyway, has been solidified as it is, without a lot of potential. Still - the point R3 is very large!]
;W[pb]C[Hon: A pity that white gets in this move!];B[qc];W[jb]
;B[ib];W[kb];B[ea]LB[me:D][cq:B][qq:C][cr:A]C[Hon: Strange to connect here.

Since white is alife anyway and you are also alive and have no problems, I would maybe look for another large place, like A to D. If you play here, then rather J17.]
;W[ic]C[I forgot about this cut. I misread and thougt E19 was necessary.

Hon: Well, this is no problem.]
(;B[hb];W[jd];B[id];W[kc]
(;B[ik]C[Hon: You should not kill weak groups like this directly - you only give him a good excuse to sacrifice it.]
;W[ie];B[hd];W[jg]C[Hon: This move prepares a squeeze.]
(;B[ih]C[Hon: Close to your strength. He can sacrifice the stones now and at the same time destroy your center potential.]
(;W[ig];B[hg];W[hf];B[gf];W[hh];B[gg];W[ji];B[ii];W[ij];B[hj]
;W[jh];B[jj];W[qh]C[I wasn't sure how to answer this.

Hon: in the joseki formation in the upper right, when white plays at this point, you normally play at R18 - a valuable move which also gives you immediate solidity. Then R12 would be sitting next to a living group.]
(;B[ph]C[Hon: Covering is very often a good move ...];W[qi]
C[Hon: ... but in this case you just help him make use of his dead stones.]
;B[qj]C[Hon: Since you insist on keeping them dead ...];W[pi]
C[Hon: ... he has no trouble escaping now.];B[oi];W[pg];B[oh]
;W[qg];B[of];W[oj];B[ok];W[og]C[Hon: At this point the game has become too close, and the stronger player is likely to win.

Your mistakes in this game were first to pincer on the left in front of his strength. He did not continue in the best way, but he was able to live easily on the lower side, which reduced the value of it for you. 

Then you missed the opportunity to attack the O17 stone, which would have been very profitable, since there was still weakness.

At last you made the mistake of capturing the center group directly, although you were strong everywhere, instead of playing away from it, building up. White reduced you in sente, sacrificing, and then had an easy road into your right side.

Try to understand the principle of playing close to weakness and away from strength thoroughly by using it as a strategy in your games!]

But altogether white has already profited too much. He should win the game easily by just playing endgame.]

(;B[ke]LB[fg:B][gm:A][mn:C]C[Hon: If for example you just play here, I also say no escape route for white.

Another way to put it: You are strong in all surrounding places. So why add more stones there? Rather play at L15, where you have weakness! Like this you increase the value of your whole formation.]

Right now he is sitting right next to a living group - a useless place to be.]

(;W[pb]C[Hon: Now white got away with his mistake, and black is overconcentrated on the left side, since he played close to his strength.]
))
(;B[pb]C[Hon: Here instead! You take 14 safe points in the corner and weaken his group. Walls are made for attacking, not for making points. White will run in front of your wall, then you will get the complete right side.

Make him play in front of your wall, don't do it yourself!]
))
(;B[pb]C[Hon: If you play here or at P17, you do the opposite of playing close to strength - you are playing close to weakness, and that is good. With one move you solidify your corner and weaken white dramatically. You have immediate profit and will get more from your attack. If instead white got Q18, he would be immediately alive (as will happen later), and you would have less corner territory and no potential for attack. That would be a waste.

Play close to weakness, it is valuable, but avoid playing close to strong positions!

Attacking the group in the center is on the one hand overkill, because it is already so weak it should die later or suffer a worse fate. On the other hand, you are strong yourself in this area already, at the top and at the bottom, so it is not clear to see how your profit will increase by attacking that group now (there might be a better opportunity later). But in the upper right, it is a big difference who plays first, because neither side is settled yet.]

Both of you kept misjudging the left side as important, but in this result black is better. White has something below 30 points, and black is the supreme ruler on the board.]

Now black has a surrounded corner (small, don't get surrounded!), and a very weak group in a place of no value. White instead has built influence on the lower side, which has more value than the left side.

But his area will not increase a lot more from there, and you built up influence towards the remaining large open spaces.

You force white to play in front of his own strength, making him overconcentrated, while you also build strength, but towards a large open place!]

When you played G16, you violated the topical principle of this review - you played close to your own strength and insisting on taking points there.]
))
(;B[eg]C[Hon: This is the first move. It is necessary, because it is sente for both.]
;W[dh];B[oc]C[Hon: Now I would look for a way to create a double attack.]
;W[nd]C[Hon: If white answers ...];B[je]C[Hon: You could jump out, and you are attacking now on a large scale.

This might not be the only good way to play, and maybe there is a better one, but it is important to understand, that simply making a few points with a wall is wrong. A wall should be used for attack!

By driving your opponent's stones towards your walls (your strength), you force him to violate the principle I am explaining to you: you force him to play close to strength, which is bad.]
