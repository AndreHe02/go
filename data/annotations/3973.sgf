C[
Thank you for reviewing my game! Along the way i have put up variations and questions. Thanks again!

- You're welcome, and thank you for submitting it to the Ladder.  I'll start all my comments with Sirkut>.  That is my name on KGS, where I play mostly.  If you have any questions regarding this review, feel free to email me sirkut001@yahoo.com.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[dd];B[fd]C[XCM: I'm not familiar with joseki's. Actually, i don't really understand their concept. What would've been a good response to the black kakari?

Sirkut> Josekis are just commonly used sequences of moves around a corner.  They are considered 'ideal' because the end result is an even trade between black and white.  I've demostrated a few common josekis from this position in the variations of the next move.]

(;W[dc]C[XCM: I made a tetchu. Is this ok?

Sirkut>  This was a good reponse because it gives a you a good solid corner.]
;B[df];W[ce]C[XCM: I was afraid black would go to D15 here. But would it have been that bad?

Sirkut> Yes that would have been bad so you were right in defending.  This also gives you definite territory, while black still has none.]
;B[ef];W[ee]TR[kc][dj][pj]C[Sirkut> This is a wasted move at this point in the game.  It just forces black to strenthen his shape.  I've marked a few better options.]
;B[fe];W[fb]C[Sirkut> This is a good move but it is too early.  In the openning you want to make broad moves and place stones that will be strategic later in the game.  This corner situation was 'done' for the time being at move 9.]
;B[do]C[XCM: How about this kakari? What would have been good?

Sirkut> Again I've illustrated some josekis for this position in variations on the next move.]

(;W[fp];B[hp];W[co];B[dn];W[fn]TR[cp]C[Sirkut> This push into the center is early.]
;B[ko];W[qf];B[nd];W[od]LB[rd:A][qi:B]TR[fn][fp][dq]C[XCM: I squeezed here because i felt it was safe. But was this a good move?

Sirkut> This move, like any move that comes in contact with you opponent, just serves to make your opponent stronger.  Both 'A' or 'B' would have been better local moves.  I would prefer B because it creates a base for you marked corner group to run to.]
;B[oc];W[oe];B[ne];W[nf]TR[od][oe]C[Sirkut> This is a place where 'hane the head of two stones' is not appropriate because your base (the marked stones) only have two liberties and are consequently very weak.]
;B[oi];W[oh];B[ph];W[pg];B[nh];W[og];B[je]C[XCM: At this point i felt black was (vaguely) outlining the centre. But i felt i shouldn't play there yet. Opinions?

Sirkut> Yes, black has been playing a very 'high' game.  While black is building very large moyo, it is so large that you can easily just play under him and get a lot of territory.]

(;W[hc]C[Sirkut> Good, but you could have gone farther. See the group of three variations off this move.]
;B[he];W[jc];B[ej];W[bg]LB[cj:A]C[Sirkut> You have plenty of room to still play 'A' here.]
;B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[em]C[Sirkut> Protecting your corner is now much more urgent!]
;B[dp];W[cp]
(;B[hm]LB[cq:A]TR[em][fn][fp][dq]C[Sirkut> Black misses the ciritcal weakness you left behind at 'A' and doesn't see it for most of the game!  This is a good size or territory and more importantly if black took it your marked stones would suddenly have had to struggle hard to find life.]
;W[np]LB[ko:A]SQ[pj][qj][rj][nk][ml][km][in][ho][hq][hr]C[XCM: To me, this was my only karari/attack on a corner stone. However, it looked isolated, no? But i felt this was better than attacking around Q6. I also felt that it was crucial to attack, lest black gain too much power in the lower left corner. What do you think?

Sirkut> On one hand Q6 and O4 are about the same because I think what you are missing is how large black's moyo really is.  I like Q6 more because the 'A' stone is there to provide backup.  If you wanted to attack on that side, I think I would have played O3 instead for safety.]

;W[mo];B[mn]
(;W[ln]LB[mb:F][qc:C][cj:B][qm:E][cq:D][qq:A][gr:G]C[XCM: My diagonals at W68 and W70 were aiming to penetrate into the centre.  But is there a better option? (tenuki perhaps?)

Sirkut> Rather than pushing into the center I think I would have focused on the unclaimed corner and side territory (A, B, or C), solidified your position (D + E), or extended current positions (B, F, G).  I've shown a variation on this move that might have gotten you a more solid shape into the center.]
;B[lm];W[kn];B[km];W[jn]C[XCM: At this stage i felt the white group here was reasonably safe... but read on...]

;W[le];B[lf];W[kd];B[ld];W[ke];B[kf];W[me];B[mf];W[md];B[no]
TR[op]C[XCM: This was the kicker. Now I knew the white group here was i trouble...

Sirkut> You would have been fine if you'd protected P4.];W[gn]
;B[op];W[mq];B[nq]C[XCM: ...and now i knew it was dead...];W[gm]
C[XCM: A move driven by desperation...];B[ho];W[nc];B[ng];W[fj]
C[XCM: This was the beginning of my expansion into the centre. Actually, i was feeling very proud of it when i finished.]
;B[fk];W[gk];B[pl];W[ql]C[XCM: This was bad. Now i lose 4 stones.]
;B[qm]C[XCM: See? Another kicker. 4 more stones lost. However i tried to keep my calm and play on. Perhaps i should have responded differrently here?

Sirkut> Unfortunately after 119 it was too late; after that it was too late to save them.]
;W[rm]C[XCM: Another desperate move. I forced him to take the 4 stones.]
;B[qn];W[rn]C[XCM: ...Actually I had been planning to creep along the right side all along :-)]
;B[qi]TR[ph]C[XCM: But this black move was a dramatic move. If black took the ko, and connected, I would lose my side!

Sirkut> Actually you would have been fine to just connect at Q12.  See variations.]

(;W[ri];B[ph];W[ij]C[XCM: ...so i had to play elsewhere to distract him from connecting the ko!]
;B[hj];W[ik]C[XCM: One of my more brilliant moments. This was the beginning of my reduction of the enemy's centre territory! Perhaps there is another series of plays that would have benefitted me more? If so, where?]
;B[jl];W[hi];B[dj];W[ek];B[fi]C[XCM: Now black is getting desperate...]
;W[fl];B[gi]TR[ff][gf][hf][dg][eg][fg][gg][hg][dh][eh][fh][gh]
[ai][bi][ci][di][ei][aj][bj][cj][ak][bk][ck][al][bl][cl][am]
[bm][cm]C[XCM: ...more desperate...

Sirkut> Actually I think both those moves were good for black.  Now that he knows you are going to get into the center he needs to reduce the amount of damage you'll do.  It looks like he's trying to strengthen his position around the marked moyo.]
;W[gj];B[hh];W[ii];B[ih]C[XCM: Now i have made a clear path for annihilating the centre.]
;W[jh]C[XCM: I was following a proverb at this point: "At the head of two stones play hane". Was this wise?

Sirkut> At least in this situation, where you're just trying to reduce as much of black's moyo as you can, there are very few bad moves. ;)]

(;B[jg];W[kh];B[kg];W[kj]C[XCM: More expanding into the centre...]
;B[lh]TR[ji][ki][jj]C[XCM: This move initially surprised me, but after a closer look this stone pessessed potential lethality. I need to make a bamboo joint right away. Or is there a better option?

Sirkut> As long as you connect at one of the three marked positions you'll be fine, and there outcome should all be about the same.]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[mj];W[li];B[mh];W[mk];B[ml]
;W[ro]LB[rj:B][cq:A]TR[qc][bj]C[XCM: After thrashing the centre i continue to creep along the right side... Is this good?

Sirkut> A and B are _very_ urgent.  'A' I've explained already. 'B' I'll explain more when you ask about it in a few moves. Also, the marked positions are _huge_ compared to S5.  When you're ahead in the game, try and keep your lead by defending before attacking more.]
;B[rj]C[XCM: This was tough for me. Black could've taken my S11 and R12 stones, thereby alowing him a path to expand into my upper right corner. However, i knew that if i didn't play at S8, my 5-stone unit at Q9 will be killed. I decided that the large unit was more important. Thoughts?

Sirkut> R12, S11 and the group at R8 are small.  Now that black has S10 (which as shown in the variations on move 161 could mean death for all the R8 and S5 stones) I think the best option is to run into his corner and take as much as you can.  See the variation on the next move.]

(;W[rl]
(;B[jj]C[XCM: This was an eye-opener for me. I would have thought that he would play S12 to eat into the corner. But instead he is forcing me to connect my bamboo joints.

Sirkut> This is called a 'senti' move.  Since you have to respond, black has control of the game and can then decide to go on to S12 next if he wants.]
;W[ji];B[dk];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm]C[XCM: I felt this was a bad move...

Sirkut> Small mistake.];B[dm];W[el];B[bm];W[pi];B[ch]C[XCM: throughout the whole game, this area worried me the most. Black has now secured a wide swathe of territory in the centre around G13. Was there a move i could've played to minimise his territory?

Sirkut> A good saying is "Your opponents good move is also your own!"  C12 would have been the best place to cause damage to black's territory.  It's all about how to get there first. ;)]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[bh];B[ci];W[cf];B[gc];W[fc];B[gb];W[fa];B[hb]
;W[ib];B[hd];W[ic];B[nb]
(;W[mc];B[jd];W[kc];B[qq];W[eq]C[XCM: This time i wanted to creep (safely!) along the lower side... Was this a good idea?

Sirkut> Yes, E3 was a big move.];B[gq];W[fo];B[ph]C[XCM: Ahh, this was my moment of briliance (read on!)...]
;W[oq]C[XCM: No, this wasn't a stupid move. I fully understood that my white unit at M5 was dead. However, with THIS move i was giving black a choice: either connect the ko at Q11, thereby destroying my side, or kill my white group now and allow white to win the ko at Q11. (Actually, after further analysis I think that even if black took the ko, white would have still been dead on the bottom. I won because black didn't read the bottom correctly [i think...\]. Thoughts?)

Sirkut> Let's see...]
(;B[mp];W[pi]C[XCM: Taking the ko...];B[mr]C[XCM: I was laughing here. Black had already sealed off the bottom. Why play there anymore?

Sirkut> You could have still used the stone at N3 as a ko threat later because it would threaten to capture O3 for life of the group.]
;W[ph]C[XCM: And success! I win the ko! My right side is safe (for now...)]
;B[fq];W[ep]C[Sirkut> This move wasn't needed.  You don't need to connect two live groups.]
;B[rp]C[XCM: Black is pushing me...];W[sp]C[XCM: A yose-type move, i know...]
;B[sq];W[so];B[rh];W[rg];B[si];W[sk];B[sm];W[sj]C[XCM: This is the move that saved my bacon. Even my oppnent praised me for this move (because i had made it so quickly). I now know why this was a good move, but at the time i played this, it felt strangly instinctive, as if i had to move there. It wasn't until AFTER i played there that i KNEW it had been the right choice. See variation next page.]

(;B[lb]C[XCM: I took black 30 minutes to make this move. I think he was still speechless when i played at T10 :-). Good thing this game had no timer.]
;W[mb];B[ma];W[ob];B[pc];W[qc];B[qe];W[qd];B[pb];W[oa]C[XCM: I played here instead of capturing at O19 because i felt i could capture it later. What do you think?

Sirkut> Be careful of the snap-back.  See variation on next move.]

(;B[re]C[XCM: Black was looking very scary at this point. I was thinking: "Is he going to win the corner?" I just played on to find out.]
;W[rd];B[rf]C[XCM: I felt that this move had the potential to save the R10 black group. Thus i decided to seal its fate...]
;W[rk]C[XCM: ...like this.]
(;B[sd]C[XCM: Getting VERY scary now. Will I win? Or will black?

Sirkut> Yep, mistake for black.  If he would have played R18 he'd have lived.]
;W[sc]
(;B[se]C[XCM: After this move i sighed with relief. Black will NOT win this battle now... (see variation at Q15)]
;W[pe]C[XCM: Yay!];B[qb]C[XCM: Desperate move by black.];W[sf]
;B[or]C[XCM: Useless move by black...];W[fr]C[XCM: More creeping along the side...]
;B[gr];W[fs];B[gs];W[er];B[bi];W[ai]C[XCM: Early stages of yose...]
;B[aj];W[ah];B[de];W[ed];B[ao];W[ap];B[an];W[id];B[cq]C[XCM: Yet another kicker move. I should've played at B3 instead of J16!

Sirkut> Here it would have been best to just cut your losses and force black to capture your stones.  If you can do it and keep senti you'll be able to keep pushing in after you defend.  See the variation on the next move..]

(;W[ie]C[XCM: Will black save this K15 group, or continue to invade the corner?

Sirkut> Black would be silly to not keep invading the corner.  It's worth about 10 more points (6 more for him, 4 less for you).  The weakness at J14 is worth about 3 points.]
;B[cr];W[cs]C[XCM: This was useless. I think I should've gone for the K15 unit... Thoughts?]
;B[bs];W[ds];B[dr];W[es];B[jf]C[XCM: See?!?! Now it's too late :(]
;W[br];B[bq];W[as];B[aq]C[XCM: I could've ignored this, but I was getting nervous at this point. I just HAD to play at B1 then. I should've played at somewhere more crucial. Thoughts?

Sirkut> You could have ignored it but it would need to be played eventually, and you're very close to the end of the game anyway.]
;W[bs];B[bp];W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[hg];W[mg]C[XCM: I must've been crazy at this point. This was one of those "wouldn't it be nice?" moves. Obviously black wouldn't let me kill him...]
;B[lg];W[ha];B[tt]C[XCM: He passed! I can take away one more point!

Sirkut> Not really. ;)  He had to play G16 before playing G19 anyway.]

Thank you for reviewing my game!

Sirkut> Thank you for the opportunity to review it.  It was interesting and you played well.  If you remember and think about the following key ideas, I think you will improve quickly:
- Focus first on the corners and sides before pushing into the center.  It's easier to make territory in the corners and sides so only push into the center once you don't have any other better options.
- Keep asking yourself "Is the territory I'm defending by replying to my opponents last move bigger or smaller than what I could get by playing elsewhere?"  Defending the territory you've claimed is also a 'big move'.
- Keep your groups connected.  When your groups are large you don't need to worry much about keeping them alive and will have an easier time controlling the game (and not letting your opponent control you).

I hope you enjoyed this review and found it helpful.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.]
