C[dear reviewer,
i'm black in this game
well, i think my opponent made some mistake but sadly he still win this game
(actually i win by 1.5 but i forgot to mark J14 as dead group, worth 3 points)
i already point out which move i think bad
i would appreciate if u can review it and point out if there's another bad move and show the variation of better move
thanks

Dear f4223n354 (such a tough username to type out lol),
Overall you played a good game but with some mistakes (but that's to be expected of any game of go right :P?). You played a good yose (endgame) but you could use some work on fuseki (opening) strategies. I hope this review is helpful for you! By the way, this is my first review so any feedback as to what you liked and didn't like about the review would be very much appreciated! Thank you and I enjoyed reviewing your game.

Refer to the beginning for comments on the game as a whole. Also, b6 was not that important or worth very many points compared to the monkey jump at R19.]
