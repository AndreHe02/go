C[[WayFarer - Hi, I'm playing as White.  I had difficulty with the opening that my opponent played, and it seemed to go downhill from there.  I think I won due to my opponent's complacency.  Thanx for the comments!\]

Hi WayFarer,
My name is John, and I'll be your reviewer. About a year ago I reached 2k on KGS, but have played little since :-(. However, I still hope I will be able to help you through this game.

Contrary to your comments, I actually thought your opening was fairly solid. Instead most the problems I saw were in the middle game and endgame.

Also, I felt you have a good grasp of the technical side of the game, but are lacking on the more conceptual aspects, such as attacking and defending groups.

More detailed comments inside. Thanks for the game, it was a pleasure to review. If you have questions, please e-mail me. For more informal discussion AIM: etrynus

Good luck,
John];B[qd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[fe]C[[WayFarer - This threw me off.\]

B's move is not in my joseki knowledge and I don't think it is optimal for him. Nor should you feel uncomfortable with it because...

1) it does not put pressure on the W group. The reason D18 is the most popular followup for B is because if W does not answer, B can then play C12 and constrict W severely. B's move does not do that.

2) B still needs two moves to secure the top side. If he subsequently plays one, W can play the other.

So I think your tenuki was just fine.];W[op]C[[WayFarer - When in doubt...\]]
;B[dh]C[[WayFarer - This caused me to panic.  I had no idea what to do here.\]]
;W[ef]C[[WayFarer - I tried to keep his groups separate.  I didn't see E13 working out for me.\]

Again, I think you did fine. I am glad you played this and not something like D18, which would have been a little too conservative.

E13 could be just as good but less peaceful.];B[gg];W[eh];B[ei]
;W[fh];B[ci]C[[WayFarer - At this point, I felt I was at a huge disadvantage.  I wasn't sure what to do here.\]

Nope, W good :-)

I think you are overestimating the power of B's chain of three stones up top.]

(;W[nd]C[[WayFarer - Upon retrospect, I think this point is bad.  I think M17 would've been better, because it allows me breathing space on both sides.\]

This is a good direction for you to be heading, but you missed a fairly simple and important move at F11. Check out the variation.

Not only is it in sente (unless B wants to abandon the left, not a good idea), but it allows your W group in the top left to reach out into the middle. I think F11 is pretty much a must.

I also agree that M17 is better.];B[lc]C[A nice move for B.]
;W[oc]C[[WayFarer - I don't know any joseki here, so I just played what felt natural, which is to keep his R16 and M17 stone apart.\]

This is joseki.

Google "kogo's joseki dictionary" for a good joseki dictionary in sgf format.]
;B[pb]C[Not a good move, Q14 is much better.];W[pe]C[A good response.]
;B[pd]C[[WayFarer - I didn't see this.  I thought he would respond at R15.  I was hoping to build a wall facing the M17 stone, aiding me in an invasion around K17.\]]
;W[oe]C[Given that you are in black influenced territory, I would suggest playing a bit 'ligther', like at O14. That would give you more options and also you do not have to be as attached to the stones you've already played.]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg]C[Ugh. B is helping you too much here.]
;W[qh];B[pc]C[??? Very bad move.

This whole sequence benefits W a lot.];W[kd]C[[WayFarer - I know I have a weakness at P13.  I felt I had to take that risk and make this attack.  I already gave him the corner.\]

I think both you and B are overvaluing B's corner and undervaluing W's influence.

I am not sure about L16. The 'standard' approach here is probably to double approach the B stone in the lower right. While constricting B, you can also build a wall facing your R12 group, and give yourself the potential for a lot of territory on the right side.]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[le];W[kg];B[lf];W[kf];B[lg]
(;W[lh]C[L12 better I think. W is not ready for the hane because the cut at L12 will haunt W later.]
;B[ng]C[[WayFarer - Mistake on his part, should've been at P13, I think\]

Agree.];W[og];B[mh];W[li];B[oh]
(;W[of]C[This is poor. Q11 would be nice. Check out the variation.]

(;B[od]C[Pretty bad. Check out variation to see a better move for B.]
;W[ne]C[These stones are worthless - just get out with a move like R9. B can still move Q10 for maximum pressure.]
;B[nc];W[ph]C[Again, you'd rather jump out than waste a whole move creating an eye (that can't even be taken away).]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[pi];W[qi];B[rj];W[qk]C[Ugh.];B[rk];W[qj]C[R9 was a wasteful move. You should have just moved R10 in the first place. R9 doesn't do much for you, but B's response did something for him.]
;B[ql]C[[WayFarer - This is so bad for me.\]

Agree =P];W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[pn];W[on];B[po];W[nj]C[I'd be safe and just connect at P5. Leaves a lot of bad aji. Imagine you were B and think how happy you'd be to get the chance to play P5.]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[jc];W[ni]C[[WayFarer - I saw the squeeze with the throw-in at O12 after I made this move.\]]
;B[nh];W[kc]C[Since you played no followup for this move, it was worthless. Just taking away one of your own liberties.]
;B[kb];W[cl]C[I still like F11 as an opener in this section because it looks like your L13 group may need help in the near future.]
;B[el];W[dk]C[[WayFarer - Here was my strategy at this point:
 - Separate the E11 group and the E8 stone.
 - Create a lot of cutting points in his shape while attacking the E11 group and E8.
 - Using these cutting points and the wall at L15, cut the Knight's extension from F15 to G13.
This was an ambitious strategy on my part, but I still felt desperate.  Sure, I had a nice wall in the center, but I had no real territory except for the upper left, and my wall still had cutting points depending on ladders and such.  He had solit cast in the upper right and right side.\]

Yeah, W's wall is pretty crummy. That's why I advocate attacking B's left group from F11. This will allow W to create another wall facing the middle which will help your L13 group a lot. By attacking from the inside (D9), you are allowing B to create a wall facing the outside, which will create even more problems for your L13 group.

This is an important concept I think. For example, if W's L13 group was strong, then D9 would be a fine attacking point. Hope you see why.]

A big one.];B[gk];W[ii];B[hi]
(;W[jd]C[First, you should make the D10 sente as early as possible (now).

Second, K16 is not very good. Better to firmly connect your L13 group back outside with something like N11, M10 or L10 (although that feels weird to me for some reason).

Lastly, K16 is aji-keshi because you have some possibilities (in the variation) that almost work, but don't yet. However, by plyaing K16 you are eliminating all these possiblities, and not helping yourself much at all.]
;B[ic];W[gd];B[ge];W[fd]C[Looks like you're creating problems for yourself.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[ee];W[de]C[[WayFarer - I didn't notice his nice move at E13\]

;W[hd]C[[WayFarer - I read out this sequence and realized I could save these stones.  However, it would've been in gote, so I now realize in retrospect I should've played on the lower portion of the board.\]

Actually, if B didn't have E13, this would be an interesting move, because it creates a very weak B group. As it stands though, yeah, this move does not do much.]
;B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[hc];W[ig]C[Is this necessary? Save your D9 group. It is in great danger (and has been for a while). That's why you should have moved D10 way back when. Now D10 is no longer sente.]

Eventually, the game was "adjourned."  It was only after I scored it off IGS that I realized I won.  More importantly, I didn't realize I won by so much.

I've scored it correctly on here.\]

Oof. Sorry to say it, but that was a pretty poor endgame (B's was worse than W's). When you reach the stage where the life/death of groups have been decided, that is the start of the endgame. At that point, if the time structure you're using allows it, I'd suggest taking a full minute or two to find the largest places on the board. Places like S11/12 are a lot larger than you might think. Look at the final board, compared to what it would be if B had connected his stones underneath.

Not taking into account the life/death mistake you both made regarding C9 group, I would still say you both lost 20+ points through your endgame. It's also the easiest place to improve!

Anyways, rant aside, I'm supposed to be helping you with the harder stuff...

I think you are proficient enough technically to start thinking about how attacking certain groups will affect things all across the board. The best example is at move 74 when you decided to attack the weak black stones underneath with D9.

I remember that I used to always like to attack a group from underneath so it couldn't make eyes on the edge. It took me awhile to learn that it was actually much more important to take situations around the board into consideration. The point of attacking a group is not to kill it. You HOPE to kill it, but for the most part you are using the advantage you get from being the aggressor so that you can shape the board to your liking.

For the most part I think you outclassed B across the game.

Finally, this is a more advanced concept but I noticed that you don't like to let your stones die once you put them on the board. Try to play more lightly in a way that gives you more options, even if you are sacrificing some of your stones. Examples include the ones I mentioned in moves 22 and 118.

(Rereading my review, I can sound pretty harsh. Lol, I don't really mean to.)

Another ps: I didn't see this line until now:
>> More importantly, I didn't realize I won by so much.
I also think you are not evaluating positions correctly in the early-mid game. Unfortunately this is a tough thing to teach, besides just playing more games. However, the two types of mistakes most people make are either giving territory too much value over influence, or giving influence too much value over territory. I am probably like you: I usually overvalue actual territory and undervalue influence (potential territory). Just keep that in mind the next time you make a board evaluation.]
