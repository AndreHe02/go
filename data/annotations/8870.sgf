C[Dear reviewee. I will keep this review short, since your opponent is the one who was destroyed in the end, as well as in the beginning. 
---
Dear reviewer, this is a game I recently played on KGS, I am Black. The game ended somewhat surprisingly with White resigning at a point where I thought the outcome is quite unclear. Maybe he just had to leave. Nevertheless the game illustrates my playing quite well. I got an advantage early on, but then ran into trouble. In general I think my middle game is my weak point. Thanks for your comments!]

;B[dd];W[de]LB[bd:A]C[B16 would be terrible, white would be very happy to take ponnuki. There is a reason why this move by white is not so good, you will soon see.
---
It seems this is the wrong order as it gives me the possibility to play B16 next. However, that alternative didn't seem so appealing, so continued the "normal" way. Should I have optet for B16 here?]

;B[oh];W[re];B[qf]LB[qi:A]C[As you seem to have realized yourself, this move is not needed. Black can cut at A without pushing first, and probably should. The result is in any case quite good for black. 
---
I was preparing the cut at R11, but it has the taste of aji-keshi. Should I cut directly at R11?]

(;B[pb]LB[pe:A]C[You are right about the cut, see variation.
---
I played this, because I was thinking that White could with this move (Q18) andQ15 somehow get a connection, but maybe I was hallucinating.]
;W[dk]C[Quite big, of course.];B[fl];W[jn];B[jl]C[White probably felt s/he had to try something amazing, but this does not look like it can end well.

I thought to go all-out with the weak group on top.];W[hm]
(;B[in]TR[nc][id][jd][kd][md][le][ne]C[Although white is in trouble, you may consider attacking on a larger scale. Keep in mind that the marked white group has no eyes. See variation.
---
Maybe this is too early, but I didn't see any more "global" move.]
;W[im];B[jm];W[gp];B[fp];W[io];B[jo];W[hn];B[kn]TR[in]C[The cutting stone is captured and white has sente, the cut became meaningless.]
;W[hk];B[fj];W[hi]
(;B[ih]C[Keeping white seperated is a sensible idea. Black could also take it easy and chose a simpler attack. I think that would be enough.

I played this to keep the top group separated, but of course I always seem to underestimate problems of my own groups :-).]

The beginning of a very bad sequence for me. Maybe I should have protected my own weakness with G8 here, but it seemed unclear.]

Is this the right shape? Can I do L14 in absolute sente?];W[mi]
C[Black should take the ko and kill white now. The game is over. And that is what happened. This is the final comment.]

;B[cg];W[ee];B[gg]C[touchdown [2k\]: thx
DorianGray [2k?\]: thank you
DorianGray [2k?\]: a little suprised I am

I regreted this move as soon as I played it as the more I look at it the less sente it seems to be. Earlier on it might have been sente. All the more I was surprised that White resigned here. To me the outcome of the game seems quite unclear. Anyway, thank you very much for your comments!]
