C[Hi Mark, I'm Andrew aka salvor7 on KGS. 

 I'll try to give some insight into what you've asked about and some other things I noticed on my first pass through. I usually examine blunders by the opponent, as they usually highlight opportunities for the player asking for the review.  If there is a varition to look at, I'll put (var) or write see variation.



Hi. I'm Mark (SaurusDNA), and I'm 6 kyu on KGS. I was playing black in this game. Please review for black.

In this game, I feel that I came out of the opening quite well (even slightly ahead), but  somehow, white managed to grind me down and win by a substantial margin.

I am hoping that the review will give me some insight into the middlegame, and why I lost so much from a good position. I have tried to analyze the game afterwards, buit I'm finding it really hard to find where I went wrong.]

C[I like it.  The double kakari is not obviously any worse for you (see variation) The right side stone is probably the one to build with as white is missing a base below it. 



Here, I was unsure about the best response.  I need to strengthen the q8 stone, so that I can attack the weak white group later, but r11 gives white a double kakari at o17.

Was r12 OK? Was there a better strategy?]
(;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc];B[me]
C[This is optional here. Its role is to protect against the funny business white has with R14, but the proximity of r12 takes care of most of it for you.  R6 seems to be more pressing.  Return to N15 after it.]
;W[rm]
(;B[cf]C[this is likely the wrong side.  the C6 stone makes the left side slightly undesireable.  Plus F17 works well with the move at N17. (var)


What was the best way to approach this stone, and was the tenuki too early?]
;W[ch]
(;B[fc]C[Not sure running does all that much bad.  (var)


I felt that running gives white too much on to, and there's nothing for black on the left. However, there isn't anything om the top either, so I suspect this may have been a mistake.]

(;B[bg]C[this is fine in ruining whites left side. (var)];W[cg]

(;W[jd];B[mc]C[This is a good start for sure.  


How best to reduce white's moyo?];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb]
(;B[nd]C[O16 is ajikeshi (wasting potential)  See var for why.]
;W[oc]
(;B[rr]C[It's hard here to deny white anything.  (var)

This was a mistake. I meant to deny white a base, but it did more harm than good.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pk];W[qj];B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[ro]
(;B[mm]C[I feel that this is the wrong direction.  Black can connect up and enclose white at Q10.  No need to run.  (var)]
;W[pi];B[fo];W[dr];B[oo];W[bh]C[This is a big move.  One that black perhaps should have made.  The left side went from being nothing to 10ish points.  the game is quite close now, and thats without accounting for whites left side influence, and the almost weak blacxk group on the right at R15.  I think black has some work to do now.]
(;B[op]C[So see previous comment about the game state.  I think black needs to start reducing (var)

P4 is also not that great.  Even if there is aji there, (and I'm not sure that it is) black has more pressing things to do.


At this stage, I feel fine. In fact, I think I might even be a little ahead.

From here, it went downhill - I just don't know how to deal with the reductions.]
;W[kc]C[Now white leads nicely.  Together p4 or P5 were not worth even this, and white got B12 too.]
;B[kf];W[if];B[oi]C[the center here is gone.  the stone at Q11 is too strong. 
Trying to make gains near it is why the points here were reduced so much.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[pg]
(;B[rf]C[this is probably a big end game move.  You should reduce white in big ways or find moves like this that are big sente.  White can easily live even if you follow up, so this is not a good move now.

(vaR)];W[jk]C[This is probably game over.  All black's center potential is effectively gone, and that was black's last hope.]
(;B[ek]C[Possibly.  K9 is the weaker stone round here, so aiming at playing moves that cut it off should gain you some entry into whites area. (var)


Too deep?];W[fm]C[White plays the cut off game in reverse.]
;B[gk];W[hm]
(;B[en]C[see var for an alternative];W[em]
(;B[do]C[wasted move I think. (var)];W[co];B[dm];W[dn]C[Allowing this cut is a misread I suspect.  E7 was likely better than E6 see var a few moves ago.


This cut devastated me.

How should I have handled this situation?];B[dl];W[fn];B[eo]
;W[go];B[gp];W[ep];B[fp];W[ho];B[bm]C[It's a tough situation for black.  Black must live on both sides to really have a chance.  White H7 is fine now.  Unless things go weird, white can live I think.  the corner is also alive, so white is fine here.

Both sides are weak. I decided that this group was more important...]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[bn]
(;B[cp]C[I suspect that you should not play this move yourself.  fix B8 and let white play on the inside.  (var)]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[dq];B[an];W[bo];B[bk];W[bq];B[bi];W[hp]C[The move at D3 that white played due to black;'s inside play is helping to narrow the options for black here.  E2 might have been a reasonable play if d2 was not fully connected.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[is];W[fr];B[ip];W[eq];B[dg]C[At least I get sente, and some compensation.]
;W[eh]
(;B[fh];W[eg];B[fi];W[fg];B[il]C[Thsi seems like the wrong side of K9.  Black can do nothing to the h7 group.  Maybe h13 attach is better.]

(;B[kd]C[not sure this does mcuh.  If you want to live up there, O13. If you want the center M11.  N12 might do a good job of both of these.]

There was also the sense that black was trying to make points in areas that had become fruitless, like the center and right side.  A better idea of thickness, moyos and invasions might be good to learn to clarify whats important and when.
