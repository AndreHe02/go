C[Dear Reviewer,
 I am white in this game and thank you very much for reviewing and helping me improve. In this game I played someone apparantly quite a bit stronger than me and got crushed after reacting to his moves in fundamentally bad ways, as I realized a few moves later.
I would like to ask you what principles those wrong moves violate so that I can avoid similar mistakes in future. From my own review I add very few variations, since I'm sure they're all wrong anyway and are just to show ideas I have as to how a situation might turn out. In these cases please tell me if those general ideas and expectations, rather than all moves in a variation are correct.
The same applies to my comments and annotations, which are the most important part I would ask you to correct or approve of.
In this game a complex fight arose. The most important question I have is what general outcome I should have expected, tried to achieve and what KIND of moves would achieve that, rather than concrete variations which are too difficult for me to read during a game.
Once more thank you very much for your help, I'm very much looking forward to reading what you think the reason was I lost, as I'm sure it wasn't just fight-reading.

H: Hi I'm Simon. I'm a 29-year old Belgian playing go at around KGS 2k level. You can find me on KGS as 'Hushfield'. Feel free to add me if you have any questions. Or you can just contact me on the email address through which you received this review. 
All my comments in this file should be preceded by "H: "];B[qd]
;W[dd]LB[dp:A]C[I believe I need to play this corner since it's the "widest" side?

H: I don't think you "have to" do anything at this stage. Also note that this allows Black to play a diagonal fuseki, making for a game with many small groups (and possibly a lot of fights). If you don't like that sort of game, play around A instead.]
;B[cp]C[So it's a cross-game. Supposedly that's good for white. Now I'm not sure what I should play. I think I want to take the last corner but is it a good idea to play two 4-4s in a cross game where influence might be hard to use? I play a low stone, once more on the "wider side". Pro databases suggest 4-4 is played most often, followed by 3-3 and my move. The 4-4 popularity contradicts my logic. What is the correct way to think about this?

H: Aha. It happened. I have no advice to give you about this opening because I always open up in the opposite corner. I don't like diagonal fuseki, so I never allow it as white and never play it as black.
As far as "white has an advantage" goes, that idea mainly originates from there being komi, and diagonal fuseki leads to games with smaller territories, hence enhancing the value of komi. However, how many of your own games have been decided by komi? I'm guessing it's a tiny percentage. The vast majority of games are decided by life and death of groups, or large capture. Focus on the middle game, and don't worry too much about the opening for now.

For some discussion about diagonal fuseki: http://www.lifein19x19.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2567

(There is something to be said about trying out new ideas and experimenting in the opening. It too is part of becoming stronger, but avoiding openings you don't like should not impede your progress in any way until you're rising up the dan ranks.)]
;W[pq];B[fc];W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[ic];W[qo]C[This has been played by pros before apparantly. The next move deviates.

H: It's a solid move. You're doing just fine in the opening, I haven't spotted anything I would have done differently.]
;B[oc];W[ep]LB[db:1][cc:2][ic:3][qo:4]TR[oc]C[I assume the high approach is proper here?

H: I don't like the low enclosure for black all too much. Also, as you can see from your own pro library, approaching in the lower left is bigger. You proceed to take the bigger point. All is fine.

Low vs high approach:
- this fuseki is almost non-existent in pro play. Omitting the completed joseki in the top left, there are few more instances of the low vs the high move, but it's not a significant sample size.
- what you want remember is why you play in this area in the first place: you want to build a large framework on the bottom side, using your corner enclosure in the lower right. Black will try to prevent this (most likely pincer). Apart from that there are just too many possibilities. Don't get too fixated on specific moves/joseki, but tell yourself a story. "I want to play in this general area so that I can aim towards building the bottom side."]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[dq]
(;W[gp]C[I'm trying to experiment with this as opposed to solid connection. In this case I thought this might do a better job threatening to build a big moyo on the bottom. Would it have made sense to tenuki instead?

H: Don't tenuki here. That move has its uses, but this is not one of them. Your opponent is helping you. Say thank you for forcing me to build a moyo.]
;B[cn];W[qj]LB[kq:A]C[takes away his extension and enlarges my influence of the bottom right to something that might become an overstreached double-wing formation. The question is probably how bad that overstretching is.
Is my move properly placed? I feel like I'd want to go closer to black but then he will pincer me. Is that something I should invite?

H: This is a big mistake! Where is the rest of the joseki? You should play at A. another possibility would have been as shown in variation.]
;B[dj]LB[ip:B][hq:A]C[This move seems a bit strange to me, but I guess that's just my oponent being better than me. I was expecting either him playing on the bottom or playing c12 locally, which is more severe on my group there.

H: both of you are pretending the joseki is complete, which it isn't. Black A or B would spell disaster for white's efforts on the bottom side. Shapewise C12 would be the move to play if black wants to attack the upper left now.]
;W[jp]LB[kq:A]TR[gp]C[This move, as I realize now, is really terrible. It doesn't threaten to build the bottom, as I thought it would. I'm very unsure what the proper move would have been locally to do that or if that's even something to be considered. Probably best would be to respond and strengthen my top left group somehow?

H: It actually is the right direction, but doesn't work well with the marked stone (too close, overconcentrated). A is the local move. But because you're building a moyo, I would have gone for the solid connection instead of the tiger's mouth (see earlier variation).]
;B[qh]LB[oj:A]C[I'm not sure how to respond to this. Don't think R14 is an option though.

H: solid 1-space jump. Play A and you are building a bigger moyo than black is.]
;W[oj]C[H: good!];B[ef]LB[cb:A][ch:B][oh:1][jj:3][fm:2][oo:4]
[lq:5]C[This again seems strange to me. He's trying to seal me in and threaten to build the centre it seems. However it feels as if I should be able to cut through or exploit his huge knight moves somehow... What should I be thinking here?
I extend my base, but I'm afraid to play a two space jump and also thought the once-space was more active, aiming to cut through.

H: it's a floating move. No purpose at all. It's like a pass. Use this opportunity to start telling another story.
"Ok, so he just wasted move. White has miai options for life at A and B, so I don't need to defend yet. I don't have weak groups, so I can attack. Does black have weak groups? Not really. Is there something I need to invade or reduce? Yes, that might be a good idea. Or I could just expand my own moyo." Moves from 1-5 are things I would consider after two seconds of looking at the board. I don't believe 4 or 5 to be much good, so I would be tempted to play anywhere 1-3.]

(;W[ch]C[H: you defend a group which is not really under attack. A missed opportunity.]
;B[ci]C[Is this a good move?

H: locally it's bad shape by black. Explore variations to see why.]

(;W[eh]LB[dh:A]C[Following my plan of cutting through and at least destroying his hopes to build the middle. Looking at the current score, I think I'm behind already. Blacks top territory seems quite solid, also the bottom left is quite big and seems hard to reduce. My huge "moyo" however has little hope of making a lot of territory.

H: But this is much worse. While occasionaly played by pro's for very specific reasons, it's just a terrible idea. You should almost always just play at A.]

(;B[dh]LB[dg:A]C[Is this a good move? I have no idea what he's trying to do here.

H: He is trying to take advantage of your tactical mistake. A would have been better, though (see var)]
;W[dg];B[ei]C[Is this even a ko? Is it a good idea to make this for black? Should I just connect on e13?

H: it is a ko. I share your thoughts: "why?". No idea. Best ask your opponent. It seems a bit silly.]
;W[di]C[This ko seems stupid to me. If he doesn't play a threat I won't be fixing on D12 any time soon one way or the other. I decided to treat the ko and e13 as miai for not being sealed in. How worried should black be about the cuts if he loses the ko? What's the best way to exploit those without playing a heavy move at d12?]
;B[fo]C[So this looks like he's actually playing a ko threat. Is this a good move by itself? Should I fix?]
;W[fp];B[dh]C[I still think the ko is stupid. I play a probe on the top right corner as a "threat", which I thought was a reasonable move. Black is threatening E13 here. How worried should I be about it? Playing there myself seems really slow.]
;W[rd];B[rc]C[Is this the proper response by black? Would black want to play e13 if he were sure he could win the ko ?

H: The probe is a nice move locally, but you have to follow up on it, otherwise it removes all aji from the corner and blakc will get too much there.]
;W[di];B[mp]LB[oh:3][jj:1][fm:2]TR[rk][nl][pl][om][rm][pn][ro]
[rq][pr]C[Seems like an excelent move by my oponent in retrospect. I have no idea how to react to this. It's basically saying I only get like 30 points there. Expecting maybe 5 from the top left, that would mean I'm completely lost. Trying to build the centre seems unreasonable, so my plans are to build the marked region while attacking him, gain strength in the centre and then reduce his top, while my bottom left group lives with basically no points to speak of. I'm not sure if that's a plan that gives me any chance to win, as it seems black has enaugh points to win even if that works. Trying  to all out kill him doesn't seem reasonable.

H: I think this is much too deep. It's a do-or-die move. If black lives, you will lose a lot of points, but are not yet guaranteed to lose the game. If black dies, the game is more than over. A reduction, while building something of his own would have been better by black.

But ok, this where we are now. You have to deal with this. When somebody comes in too deep in a framework you are building, there are certain steps to take:
Step 1: take away any chance for the stone to make a base.
Step 2a: chase the stone to the center where you can either trap and kill it or let it escape.
Step 2b: make sure you strengthen your own position while chasing and take some points along the way.

Whatever happens here, you should get a lot in return. Either you kill (big win) or take profit on the bottom and right side while chasing and later use your increased strength in the centre to invade or reduce a black position (small win).

Also: remember that even though your idea is correct, you will lose a lot of games becoming strong enough to enforce this idea. You made a big moyo, but are not yet so much stronger than your opponent that you can kill him when he comes in. This can be frustrating because even though you play the right way, you still can't always turn that way of playing into a win. Sharper reading through doing lots of go problems will help a lot with that.]

(;W[mn]LB[kn:A]C[Probably a terrible move. I really don't know what to do. This looks as if I was actually trying to kill, but it's aimed at building the moyo on the right.

H: it's not the best move, because it skips step 1. Also, the shape is not the best. If you want to trap black, play around A and push the lone black stone towards your strong corner enclosure.]
;B[lo]
(;W[lp]LB[jn:A][kn:B][lq:C]C[This is probably even a worse move? I want to ensure he has a hard time getting eyes here and runs as far as I need him to while also making sure my bottom left group isn't in trouble.

H: This helps your opponent too much. Do you know the proverb "attack from afar?". It means never touch the stones you are chasing. That doesn't allow them to make sabaki (creating good shape by exchanging local moves) but usually keeps them floating and eyeless. After this move, black would have to make some big mistake to die or be shut in. The fight is already over. Moves that attack from afar: A, B (seal in) C (take away base)]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[mo]C[was the atari by black a good move? It seems so to me.

H: Yes: one way of making sabaki.]
(;W[mq]C[The third really terrible move in a row. Once again I don't know what to suggest for white. maybe o3 is better? Or Someting around k6?

H: see variation];B[nq]C[Here comes the punishment. Now I feel committed to take his m3 stone, while I'm really unhappy about it.]
;W[mr]
(;B[lr]LB[nr:A]C[H: a mistake by black. A offers more potential to make some shape.]
;W[nr]
(;B[oq]
(;W[kr]LB[oo:B][or:A]C[I capture his two stones while he gets to mess with my corner and escape quite easily to the middle as well. I still was hoping to build the middle right.

H: This move is too defensive. A also captures the stones, and puts more pressure on the black shape. You have B to look forward to next.]
;B[or];W[kq]LB[kr:1][or:2]C[seems to leave less aji than m1. Was it ever an option to sacrivice the n2 stones with the intent to kill him? I don't think so.

H: Compare with the variation. The result of playing 1 instead of 2 is terrible for white.]
;B[pn]C[I think this is a good move. don't really know how to respond. Is Q5 a better option? I'm afraid he's going to try to kill me completely if I do that.]
;W[qn]C[H: good response.]
(;B[pr];W[qq];B[qr]LB[pm:A]C[H: At this point black is clearly going to live anyway. Hane at A might give you more points.]

(;W[rr]LB[pm:A]C[bad move. leaves a lot of shape problems. Not sure what I should play. Maybe either aim at o4? Try to seal him in somehow? Maybe play s3, which achieves the same think I was trying to do with my move? (which was: prevent from him getting to eyes easily in the corner.)

H: Black is going to live or escape, you're too late there. A would be bigger.]
;B[pm]
(;W[ql]LB[qm:A]C[Another bad move. This is bad shape, I think? Not sure what to suggest though. I want to ensure that my stones are connected.

H: If you're stuck for time or can't read everything out, it's a safe rule of thumb to extend 3 times before jumping. That would mean A.]
;B[ln];W[mm]C[support my stone.

H: Why? It's not national support useless stones week, is it?]
;B[mk];W[nl]C[ensures my two stones connect to something. Nor sure if black should have cut them more severely? Connecting to something doesn't solve my problems though...]
;B[nk];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[ml]C[I don't like this move. Doesn't seem to do very much, I can still cut through m7 and this "forces" me to poke at his shape, basically denyhim him an easy eye there?

H: It's actually a good way to squeeze white and force you into an empty triangle. I like the black move.]
;W[nn]C[I think this is the proper response.];B[no]LB[oo:A]
C[H: A instead would also connect all 3 black groups and be better shape]
;W[oo]C[This might be an overplay, given my weak corner shape... s2 comes to bite me.]
;B[on];W[op]C[Aiming at the cut while pretending to be connected there. That's an illusion. Probably just q5 was correct instead (or rather following p4?!)]
;B[np]
(;W[lm];B[rq]C[ouch...]
(;W[qp]C[not sure if that's a good response. Everything else I could think of during the game seems worse though.

H: Look at variations for ways you can keep fighting. It's useless at this point however. Black will live or escape.]
;B[sr];W[rp];B[rs]C[Maybe t3 is better? (by like 1 point endgame... well, I guess that's not worth the aji? I think that lives too though)]
;W[pd]C[I'm desperate and try to see what he'll do up here...]
;B[qe]C[Didn't expect this move. At a complete loss as to how to respond.]

(;W[qc]C[this unfortunately doesn't seems to work.];B[pc];W[pe]
;B[pf];W[re];B[qf];W[qb];B[rb];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri]C[the game is lost. I play a couple more moves and resign. Basically the only way I could possibly win this would be killing the n9 group after it runs in a big way. Black would maybe even be fine after sacrificing it, which he doesn't need to as I won't be able to capture it.
My last question:
Are there proper ways (locally) to use the q16 stones and/or play some reduction around m17?

I include the rest of the game for completeness sake. Thank you for reviewing, I hope you didn't think this was too much of a massacre with completely obvious mistakes by me, which wasn't worth looking at. Looking forward to hearing from you.


H: Thank you for submitting your game. Don't worry about there being mistakes. I make them all the time. When you start spotting those, you can do something about them.

My thoughts:
1) Your sense of direction in the opening (fuseki) was splendid.
2) You made a big mistake in joseki at white 18. Make sure you always finish the joseki. It might give your opponent sente at times, but will leave you without weaknesses to exploit.
3) You had a good game plan, but still lack the reading ability to back that plan up with solid moves at times.
4) Don't forget about the basic methodology for dealing with invasions: 1) take away the base 2) chase the stones, while making profit 3) trap and kill the stones (big win) or make enough profit chasing stones (small win)
5) Attack from a distance. Touching is something you do as an invader to give your stones shape. As the attacker, attack from afar, force the opponent's stones somewhere they don't wanrt to go, and don't give them chances to make shape by touching them.
6) I think studying some material about making good shape will help you a lot.
- If you like books: "Making Good SHape" by Bozulich and van Zeijst is a very nice explanation on both theory and has really good problems.
- If you like watching/replaying pro games: look at Otake Hideo's games. He is known for always making good shape.

Personally I would recommend doing a lot of go problems to improve your reading and sense of technique in general and also reading the page on ripped shapes I put in the review (http://senseis.xmp.net/?LameDuGo)
Free: 
- Try the Go Game Guru problems (try the easy ones) https://gogameguru.com/get-better-at-go/go-problems/
- Hitachi go problems (even the easy ones might still be a bit difficult) http://www.hitachi.co.jp/Sp/tsumego/past/index-e.html

Books:
- Graded go problems for beginners volume 2 seems perfect for your level (general technique and reading ability)
- Making Good Shape seems perfect for your needs. It might be a bit difficult for you, but you're sure to learn from it.

Don't bother with replaying pro games at your level, unless you really like doing that, in which case, don't let me tell you what to do.

I hope this review helps, best of luck and have fun playing go :)]
