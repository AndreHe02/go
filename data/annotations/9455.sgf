Before review:
Hello, my name is Nilsen and I will reivew this game.
I focus much on the opening and seeing as this is a handicap game it might be hard to tell much
about your fuseki knowledge.

I will try to review to my best possible standard, however it might be that some stuff I say is wrong.
I shall try to keep my comments within "*/" signs.

----------------
After review:
After reviewing your game I see that you are not reading the groups stability that well.
The major mistakes in this game was simply not being able to find the correct move and read a few moves ahead.
I advice looking into the books, Attack and Defence and Lessons In The Fundamentals Of Go.

Also having a gameplan is important, top to think about the shapes, and which aji they have, think of how to use
this aji for your advantage.  And make a plan on how to attack something and gain from it.

Also I have added some shapes to the start of the game which is interesting.
*/

REVIEWER:

Thank you for reviewing my game. I have added some specific requests throughout the game but please point out anything you think is interesting or needs correcting, regardless of whether I asked about it or not. I am studying as much as I can between work so I would welcome any suggestions about where my game is lacking and any material that is good for studying to correct that deficiency. If you have any questions or comments feel free to email me at: ajkenny01@gmail.com

Thanks again for reviewing my game.

I think you have to follow up with r6.
It is all because of the stability of the shape and groups.
r6 is most of the time sente, because of the k3 stone being to far away.

Usually white do not wish to tenuki here, because his k3 stone is to far away.
Black can punish later, and keep in mind of the Aji.

Seems passive, by reading out, we can see that white can not connect and kill us,
White now have two weak groups, and a really big Aji in the bottom right corner.

This is a good time to make a plan on how to continue the middlegame.
Around move 50 is a thumb of rule to figure out how to do in the middlegame.

See variation for some examples.

This is not optimal for several reasons.
First it is not the biggest move.
However, the shape marked, have 3x3 as a big weakness aji.
These are all moves which I would think of, I might be missing some of them. A-E
But here we need a plan, and the only plan I can think of is attacking the B group.

It is hard to stop it, simply because you are trying to build the middle, which is really hard to do.
White can already jump in from two sides, and then expecting to get the middle is not something one can do.
Black still need to cut at "A".
