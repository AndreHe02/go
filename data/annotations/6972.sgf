C[Thanks for the review.

I've been in a rut lately, and it seems like my play is missing some good judgement.

I had been playing the chinese fuseki for some time now, so I've started looking into san-ren-sei and I tried that in this game.

I am black in this game, and my opponent played the chinese fuseki as white.

---];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[di]C[He played chinese fuseki as white, so I used the fact I was black to try to build on a larger scale.

---];B[jp];W[jd]C[When I play chinese fuseki, I like when the opponent plays the D/C 15 invasion, as I profit enormously. So, I decide to invade where I have a little more room, at C6. What else are some possibilities for me to do?

(;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[gn]C[I was trying to build up strength so that I could later invade his top right some.

Top left is what I think you mean. Also this move leaves a lot of weakness and oppurtunity to cut.]

Maybe if I didn't make that mistake I would of won, but I feel like my games have been lacking good judgement at parts.
