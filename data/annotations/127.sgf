[jp]C[A bigger  move would be a side extension at `a' or `b,' in front of the black shimari.]
;B[oc];W[jd];B[cj];W[cm];B[cf];W[ce]L[cd]C[This forces black into a  perfect extension, still leaving the corner invadable at
the 3-3 point.  Perhaps `a' is better.];B[df];W[fd];B[ec];W[ed];B[fc];W
[dc]L[db]C[Consider `a' instead.  I believe the connection is unbreakable, and  the move serves
to undercut black's position.];B[gc];W[hc]L[gd]C[I think you need to  push once more, at `a.']
;B[gd];W[fb]L[ef]C[This move serves no purpose  if black manages to connect through.  How about `a' instead,
to keep black separated?];B[gb];W[eb];B[ge];W[if];B[ff];W[ej]L[jp][pj]
C[There are bigger moves around `a' and `b.'];B[bl];W[bm];B[fq];W[eq]M[cm]L[dq]C[A move at `a,' in conjunction with the marked stone, seals the  corner.  This move
leaves you vulnerable.];B[fp];W[en]L[kq]C[This allows  black another perfect extension.  Better to get a stone in around `a.'
There's just barely enough room for a two-space extension to either side.]
;B[jq];W[pj];B[qg];W[qm];B[mp];W[qh]L[qc]C[This will just strengthen black's  corner.  Note that it is still possible to invade and
live at `a.'];B[rh];W[ph];B[pg];W[nh];B[nf];W[og]L[ri]C[This strengthens  black and doesn't help you much.  I think it's very big to get a  stone in at `a.']
;B[of];W[mf];B[me];W[lf];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd];W[nb]L[jo]C[This is small.  One of your biggest assets is a potential large center  moyo.  Perhaps
you could exploit that with a move like `a.'];B[kc];W[kd];B[kb];W[md]L[jb]C[This move just reduces your own liberties.  The only move that  might work is `a,' but
I think black still has to make a mistake.];B[le];W[ke];B[ne];W[lb];B[ib]
;W[jb];B[ja];W[jc];B[ka];W[la];B[ia];W[ob]M[nb][mc][md][lc][lb][la]L[qc]
C[A more  subtle approach is the invasion at `a.'  Although difficult, black really has  to be
careful or you will be able to save the marked stones *and* live in the  corner.]
;B[pb];W[ma];B[oa];W[ic]C[This is small.  Leave it for a ko  threat.];B
[hb];W[ef];B[eg];W[ee];B[gg];W[hg]C[Too much contact.  You are  going to drive black into that partial moyo and lose it.]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[bf];W[be];B[ae];W[bd];B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[oi];B[rj]L[oh]
C[Black should have just  captured at `a.'];W[ri];B[si]C[
 NoClue 25k*: ouch!];W[rk]C[
 NoClue 25k*: both made stupid mistake :(];B[qi];W[pi]C[This is *very*  small.  Look to that center moyo.]
;B[ri];W[gi];B[fi];W[gj];B[ei];W[dj];B[di];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bi];W[go]
L[mm]C[A move like `a' could serve to seal up some  center territory.]
;B[fo];W[fn];B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[hm]L[ho]C[Better to  connect at `a;' that will give black something to think about.]
;B[ho];W[io];B[hp];W[gl];B[fm];W[fl]M[go]L[mm]C[Driving black like this  isn't going to help, since the marked stone is dead.  I
still recommend a move around `a.'];B[em];W[dn];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq]
;B[fr];W[pn]L[mm][in]C[I really think `a' is the best point now, especially with the  possible black cut  at `b.']
;B[po];W[on];B[oo];W[mn];B[in];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[kn];W[km];B[ln];W[lm]
;B[mo];W[nn]C[Well-played sequence following the cut.];B[rn]C[
 Dug 20k : is entering byo-yomi];W[no]L[rm]C[Small.  Blocking at `a'  might be slightly larger.  I'm also a little concerned
about the life of the top left group.];B[np];W[rm];B[ng];W[mg]L[mh]C
[I don't like  this connection.  I think I'd rather play `a' and lose a point if black
continues to push.  At least the wall would be stronger.];B[fj];W[el];B
[gp];W[dm];B[go];W[sn]L[fk]C[You stand to lose more than you gain by not  plaaying `a.']
;B[so];W[sm];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[cr];B[am];W[an];B[al];W[bn];B[fk];W[gk]
;B[ie];W[jf];B[hf];W[qn];B[ro];W[id]L[ad][ek]C[I  don't think this is a point.  How about `a' or `b'?]
;B[fa];W[ea]L[da]C[Oops.  Should be `a.'];B[db];W[cb];B[da];W[ca];B[de]
;W[ad];B[af];W[je]L[ek]C[`a'  is still bigger.];B[fe];W[bc];B[he];W[sk]
