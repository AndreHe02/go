[kc]C[ ** I would play a)  or b) to develop the white shimari. Since G17 is very close   to the solid black shimari, c) is a better point on the upper side.]
;B[mc]L[lc]C[ ** The idea is right, but a) is the normal move here.]
;W[gc]C[ ** The white position is a bit cramped.];B[qj];W[qd];B[qc];W[qe]
;B[rc];W[qh];B[qm];W[cf]L[of][od]C[ ** White is creating a lot of groups. His  style has the feeling of handicap go.   Since he is very low all around the board, i.e. no thickness anywhere, he   might be in trouble if a fight develops. a) (aiming at b)) would be more  patient.]
;B[ch];W[dg];B[ck];W[dc];B[dd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb]L[bd]C[ ** a) here is  better shape, and still threatens the connection at b) (see Var. 1).]

(;B[be];W[ac];B[bd]C[ ** A17 helped white and black has an empty  triangle.]
;W[eb]L[fc][db][fb][ed]C[ ** This is a very common situation,  so I will discuss the possibilities. In   the absence of G17, a) would be an excellent move, forcing white to crawl   along the second line while building thickness. Here however it is an  absolute   no-no. Basically E17, F17 become very weak due to shortage of liberties. The   relevant proverb is 'at the end of two stones play hane'. Basically b), c)   and d) are possible. If black plays the simple move d), white is in  trouble with
 his two stones C14,D13.]
(;B[fc];W[fb];B[gd]L[fe]C[ ** a) - the eye  stealing tesuji in reverse - would be correct here.]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[he];B[gf];W[dh];B[ci];W[gh];B[bf]C[ ** You should try your utmost not to make moves  like this one. It has only   one meaning: defence. In terms of points, it is an order of magnitude  smaller   than other middle game moves. If white were to play this move, due to its
 zero point value, he would be commiting himself to actually capturing one of   the black groups (or he would have wasted an entire move). Conversely,  when   black wastes a move here the white stones become light (i.e. expendable).  So   if white were to tenuki here, and black later capture the white stones, B14   would be completely wasted.   Because of the weakness at a), black should try to fight on, turning at b)  (see   Var. 1).   You should take some time to consider the strategic principle here. There is  a   very real sense in which, when black plays B14 he has already 'lost' the  fight.   It is the same principle that states that you should normally jump out into   the centre before forming two eyes along the edge.]

(;W[mq]L[oo][of][hf]C[ ** This is quite a good point. If black played here, white would feel like   reinforcing at a). White is treating the four white stones C14 etc lightly.
 Alternatives to N3 would be b) or c).];B[ko]L[hq]C[ ** Protecting  against the invasion a).]
;W[if]L[hf][gg][ej][gj][ih]C[ ** This is bad.  White wants to protect against black a), but he also wants   to hang on to his three stones C14 etc. As mentioned previously, these   stones are light, and white would be very grateful if black would take   gote capturing them. So he should play a) (black b) etc. wouldn't make  sense
 for black).   This is a pushing battle. A position very similar to the one here is covered   in 'Lessons in the fundamentals of go' by Kageyama (in the chapter 'The   stones go walking' I think).
 If the white stones were not light (if black hadn't played B14), white  would   develop the position by playing from the weaker side, c), d) or e) for  example.]
;B[hg];W[ej]L[hf][ih]C[ ** The exchange J14 for H13 was very  not in whites favor. Had he just played   E10, he could have aimed at a) later, to contain black, or he could have   played b) to develop the lower group.]
;B[rh]L[el][rf]C[ ** This move  is against the principle of 'Never touch what you are attacking'.   When playing contact moves, both sides tend to be strengthened, which is not   in your interest (see for example 'Attack and Defemce').   In terms of territory, black is quite a bit behind at this point, but white   has two weak groups. Black a) would have territorial value (in conjunction  with
 L5), and  leave black good prospects for more centre territory. Attempting  to gouge   out whites base is of course a possible strategy, but probably b) would   be more effective in this position.]
;W[ri]L[rg]C[ ** White is aiming  at getting settled quickly, but a) would be good enough.]
;B[rg]C[ ** It  would have been better to come in at S13 directly - without S12 (see Var.  1).]

(;W[qg];B[qi];W[rf];B[rj]C[ ** Even in this variation, white was allowed  to strengthen himself.]
;W[og];B[mg];W[oc]L[mh][oi][od]C[ ** Unreasonable  and unnecessary. White should play a), b) or c).]
;B[od];W[nc];B[nd];W[mb];B[lb]L[nb][md]C[ ** Good! This is a similar position to the one at F17, so  black should   consider the double hane, or a) or b).]
;W[lc];B[md];W[kb]L[nb]C[  ** White a) doesn't work.];B[nb]L[pc][nh]
[ni]C[ ** White can't cut  at a), so black should play b) or c) to capture the white group.]
;W[la];B[ob];W[nh]C[ ** After the 'invasion' P17, the white group has once more  become weak,
 and black has good chances for a double attack.];B[nj];W[mh];B[lg];W[mj]

;W[ki];B[hh]L[ii]C[ ** a) might be better here.];W[hi];B[ii];W[hj]L[jh][ij][ih]C[ **  a) here is a mistake. Instead b) or c) is better.]
