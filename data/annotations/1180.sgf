C[Hi, I appreciate the review.  I am mgt74, white, 24k* on igs, and my opponent is NR, although he claims about 15k. I lost, and think I deserved to, although there are some points where I would love to know what I should have done.  I have added some comments, questions, and variations of my own. I labeled all my comments "mgt74:"

I would especially appreciate feedback on the beginning. I have just finished a quick read through "In the Beginning", and while I feel I am beginning to understand the principles, I am still poor at putting them into practice.

Also, in this game, I believe after the opening, I play a pretty strong early midgame, expanding my poor end-of-fuseki-position. Then I lose my rhythm and fall apart. I'd appreciate any comments along those lines too. Of course all other comments are welcome.

Thanks,  greg];B[pc];W[pp];B[qe];W[dc]C[Bear in mind that the diagonal fuseki is an aggressive one and usually leads to more fighting.]

(;W[jc]LB[eq:b][ce:a][ci:a]MA[ep]CR[ci]C[mgt74: Maybe better to take my own shimari at "a" or attack his around "b"? I was expecting him to play on a or b, leaving me open to play either one of the variations below... But, alas, he did neither...




In my opinion this one is definitly played on the wrong side. `a` would look much better to me.
Playing on the buttom left I`d prefer to play on the marked spot (see variation).


In the beginning you lay the fundamentals of you further play.
There are (at least) two options for your strategy to choose from:

a) create territory. E.g. a shimari like black played in uppper right.

b) create influence (moyo or potential territory). I.e. large extensions like the one you played though this one is, I mentioned above, on the wrong side.
'c' would have been one of these.
It can be anticipated that black will invade around 'a'.]
(;B[cj]C[mgt74: this is where he really played, and I think my response was poor...



You both seem to go for territory. Well at least the 3-line is said to be the line of territory ;-)]
;W[eq]C[


This one is really too close to black's sphere of influence on the left. You should keep farer away from it.]

(;B[dn]TR[cj]MA[hq][hp]C[mgt74: (Sorry about all the questions) Would a pincer around X have been a stronger response for black to make here? (previous variation).



I already mentioned black`s sphere of influence. He would have made better use of it if he played one of these pincers.
( I added some to your variation. )];W[hq]LB[hp:a]C[

'a' seems to be better because it stands heigher if black invades at the buttom right.]
;B[de];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[qj]
(;W[qm]LB[mp:a]C[mgt74: slow on my part, but not sure what else to do...


"Be more brave and try some fightin'" ;-)
(see variation)

It would also look good if you took the buttom by extending to the left of your corner stone.]
;B[ph]MA[qe][qj]C[mgt74: small??



It very severly connects the marked stones so it's quite useful.  Black now could leave these stones alone.
(In the end you'll see that black based the territory created in this corner on top of this strength.)

Note:
The balance of territory at this point of the game seems to be almost equal (considering the leak of white's buttom).
I'll make another note when this changes.];W[bd]C[


Somewhat a endgame move. Better do something for the connection of your buttom groups.]
;B[bf];W[ge];B[ff];W[gf];B[lq]C[


Now this is what really hurts.


Note:
I'd guess this was the turning point of the game. Now white's buttom is broken up in two parts and black will make some further damage here.]
;W[nq];B[lo];W[io];B[qq]TR[qm][lo][lq]C[mgt74: What would be the best way to respond? Ideally, I would like to either a) kill his invaders or  b) make a wall facing my marked white stone to keep a little territor here, and/or c) separate blacks invaders from his marked stones so I can attack them..

I try something in my variation below, but not sure if it would really work.



a) the corner stone is alive, I suppose. But the two marked stones are a bit in danger.

b) this would be VERY little territory. Don`t think about territory here, think about influence. And think about how you gain profit while threatening the invading stones.

c) separating is a good idea. Threaten to kill the corner stone while building up a strong wall and then attack the two marked stones would be an option here.

First, attack the corner stone to get strong yourself.
It is very important that you keep both invading groups separated.]
;W[qp];B[pq]
(;W[rq]C[


Don't try to kill him. Let him live small.

And don't touch his stones so closely. Stay a bit away from them like in the variation on P4.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[rr]
(;W[rp]C[mgt74: I considered P2 as well (see idealized variation)]
;B[nr]TR[lo][lq]C[mgt74: I would have liked to have prevented this, to keep his marked stones  weak and unconnected...




From the very beginning of black's corner-invasion you should have put everything into keeping black's invading stones separated and therefore weak.
I.e. you should have concentrated to the left of his invading stone in the corner.]
;W[mp]LB[no:a][mc:b]C[mgt74: poor play on my part... I think I should lave played something Higher, Like a (O5)... or even skipped up to B (N17)




I think 'b' would make more territory. But I am not sure if you have to play 'a' here first to prevent greater loss.]
;B[lp];W[mq]C[


Tenuki. Time for N17.];B[mr];W[mo]MA[mn][mq]C[


This one leaves a bad shape. Black could cut at the marked spot.
You better played elsewhere since you played N3.];B[mc];W[ke]
;B[cr]LB[fg:a][mf:b][ln:c][ol:d][fn:e]MA[gg]TR[ke]CR[fj]SQ[ch]
[cl]C[mgt 74:  At this point, I am considering pushing in one of the following directions... On a 1-10 scale, I like   a) 10 my one fear was a cut at X later on, but i figured I could protect if necessary after the fight...
b) 7--but not great if he plays X first
c) 8
d) 5
e)  5 less important if I can play "a" first



My 2 Cent on these:

a) is a nice move. As you mentioned it's a bit dangerous also.
A very good option.
(another option would be the circled spot. but this one is not as good.)

b) if you try to build up territory than this one is not a good move since it's "opening" too much.
And you reduce black's just a little bit. Well...

c) this one does not really have a purpose since it doesn't threaten black neither does it create territory.

d) small gain of territory.

e) dito


'a' seems to be the biggest move you mentioned.

Considering you're behind in the balance of territory you should now play more risky.  On the left side seems to be a bit of a chance to get an invasion going (perhaps squared spots). At least worth a try.
This in mind 'a' is perhaps a bit too conservative.];W[fg];B[eg]

(;W[ef]C[


This one is not so good.

Better keep extending.
( see variation )];B[ee];W[eh]MA[gg]C[mgt74I I was a little worried he would play at X, just because such fights are hard for me to predict, but this seemed great so far...]
;B[dg];W[gh];B[dh];W[ei];B[ek]C[mgt74: I couldn't have asked for a better result, and a gote move from him...]

(;W[fj]LB[gk:a][mf:b][lg:c][lh:d][ln:e]MA[kh][jh][ji]TR[mn]
[mo][mp][mq][nq]C[mgt74: ...but,  I stopped pushing here (bad me) and played a very submissive and slow move... At this point, I am still way behind, and need to do something stronger... maybe at one of the other points instead??
a) probably gote, but continuing my direction of attack (maybe he will respond by invasion around X to kill my potential moyo)?
b) attack while enlarging moyo a little?
c or d) to begin to solidify my moyo--i think too submissive though.
e) guard against his play at the triangle to attack my marked group, define the left border of my LR territory, and reach toward my LL group




(moyo is potential territory)

a) if I were black and you'd play there i'd probably cut.

So one to the left of 'a' seems better to me.

b) your territory will not get bigger by this. You keep black from building territory there hisself, though. But this is small and it's not a severe attack.

c, d) I like 'd' - if it's just to get some territory.

e) this is a good guarding move for the triangled stones, indeed.  And I like my "idealized" continuation ;-)  ( see variation )]
;B[fk];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]LB[jl:a]MA[lh]
C[mgt74: very bad on my part...  I was afraid if I played "a" he would play in place of my 61... probably not a real concern... I was overly worried about my new territory being invaded... now, My potential territory has shrunk, and he can attack my LL stones from his wall--he doesn't thankfully...



This "territory" you just created is very accessible from the right. Perhaps this move of yours should have been around the marked spot.

Your LL looks very lonely now.

And I wonder what would be the gain of playing 'a' except that black could cut?]
;B[jr]LB[jl:a][fl:b]TR[fk][ek]C[mgt74: I debated ignoring this and playing at a--threaten to connect and develop strength for possible cut at b... If I keep his marked group weak...



'a' would connect?
( see variation at next node. )]
(;W[ir]C[mgt74: I know, just developing the strength of his stone.... adding little potential benefit for me...]
;B[me];W[lf]LB[lh:a][kh:b]C[mt74: too slow? again, strengthening him more than me.



Yes, I think this one is too slow. It doesn't hinder black from building up his territory but still leaves your own territory open for invasion. So 'a' or 'b' would have been a better choice.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[mf];W[lg];B[jq];W[fo]C[I was actually building for the  cut i mentioned at F8 (which you will see later as I develop it). Maybe I should have saved this move however...



It would work better if you played it one square up.
And still, this group is vulnerable.];B[cd];W[cc];B[be];W[dd]
;B[ce];W[bc];B[ed];W[ec];B[mn]C[mgt74: pretty big point...

TR[mm]C[mgt74: I considered saving the marked stone, but couldn't risk losing this chance to kill innocent stones. Maybe I should have gambled more considering I'm losing



No, the move you made is very big. Why risiking this oportunity by saving one single stone.]

What if black played there? You had to play there! This was a good choice.

This extension in general is not so good since it can easily be cut.
Consider playing the knight-moves on top and to the left of your actually played one.
'a' will create some territory.
'b' will put some pressure on black's corner stone.
