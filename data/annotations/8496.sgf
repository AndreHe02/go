C[Hi,

I'll be reviewing for black.

First, you'll learn more playing against humans than against computers.

Playing against computer is like playing against just one person all the time,
and that person never learns anything, so you'll learn how to exploit computer's
programmed weaknesses instead of learning how to play well.

What's worse, computer tries to play at lower difficulty by randomly making
mistakes so dreadful even beginners rarely make them.
There is plenty of examples of such in this game.

Enjoy the review.];B[pd];W[qq];B[dd];W[ep];B[pp];W[pq]
(;B[oq]SQ[op]C[This is very weak. R3 stone is very strong. You attacked it at Q4 to trade - white gets shut in the corner but gets safe points there, you get strong group facing center and two sides.

P3-Q4 connection is not achieving this. If white cuts at P4 he keep territory, but your group is very weak and won't be able to influence either side reliably.]
;W[nc];B[pc]SQ[qe][pf][qf]C[This is an exceedingly safe move. If you want to get control over corners fast, play 3-4 point like Q17, then 5-3 point like R15.

Q17-R15 would be better than Q16-Q17. Reversing order of moves is a good technique for analyzing moves.

If you want territory in the corner fast, play 3-4 (or 3-3). 4-4 move is for more open plays like R14 and Q14.

You don't need to learn those, it's just very early for tight moves like having two next to each other not next to opponent's stones.]
;W[cj];B[cg];W[jc];B[gc]C[That's nice use of D16.];W[lc];B[jp]
C[If P4 cut wasn't a threat K4 stone would be very safe and this would be a big move.

Strong groups mean you can expans aggressively. Weak groups mean you should be cautious.]
;W[hq];B[iq];W[qf]C[This is one of the reasons why Q17-R15 would work better than Q17-Q16. Your corner needs third stone to be safe.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[re]SQ[cc][dc][cd][oe][pi][pn][cp][hp][np][op]
[qp][cq][or]C[It's a safe move, but there are much bigger moves like:
* making your Q4 stones stronger.
* invading white's unsafe lower left corner
* attacking H4 while strenghtening your J4 group
* attacking Q14 group from the other side - white would have to connect to save it, and you connect with your Q4 group and capture right side of the board 
* cutting white groups at P15 so they don't take too much central influence
* enclosing your top left corner for sure

White benefits from this exchange.];W[rf];B[nf]SQ[oe]C[White can cut you. Even if white didn't, O14 gives you neither territory since it encloses nothing, nor much influence since if cut you have no good response.

If you want to play locally P15 is correct move. But the best way is to look elsewhere.

Unless local move is really urgent it makes sense to always consider big open spaces elsewhere on board.]
;W[oe]C[White wasn't actually the best white move either, since huge open areas elsewhere on board are worth more, but it connects two white groups keeping them quite safe, and makes O14 bad.]
;B[je]C[I would probably repeat it a lot but there are much more important moves elsewhere.

This move does something, but other moves would do a lot more.]
;W[ne];B[mo]SQ[oo][po][np][op][qp][nq][or]C[Any of these would protect the cut, N5 leaves P4 vulnerable.]
;W[qm];B[pj];W[dm];B[ej]C[Bigger moves elsewhere, but not that bad.]
;W[ph];B[jj]SQ[cc][mf][nh][cp][hp][cq][or]C[This looks big, but really isn't at this point. A move like C3/C4, H4, P2 would be much bigger.

If white N14 or C17 or O12 top half of the board won't give you as many points as you'd expect.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo]
(;B[pm]SQ[or]C[P2 much better. If white P2 you lose a lot of territory here. If you P2 white must respond to protect his corner. Then you can make a move like this.]
(;W[pl];B[ol]C[A big mistake, white Q6 cut destroys your group.]
(;W[om]C[White should really play Q6 here. Black got away with something he shouldn't.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[pk];W[ql];B[qk]SQ[nm][np][op][nq][or]C[Your Q4 group is still in big danger, R9 does nothing to protect it.]
;W[rk];B[rj]SQ[nm]C[Good protection, but O7 much more urgent]
;W[ml];B[nm]C[Great move. This and P2 are essential in lower right corner.]
;W[mm];B[mk]SQ[cp][hp][cq][or]C[White N7 was pointless, black should take advantage of it and move elsewhere big.

Like P2, C3, C4, H4 etc.

What follows is a big fight with plenty of mistakes by both players.]

SQ[jo][cp][hp][ip][cq]C[Out of fight. F7 is again fairly small. White corner is still open. Or you could connect your loose stones around J3-K4 to make sure L3/M2 won't cause any problems. White L5 might still cause some issues even though the main fight is over.]
