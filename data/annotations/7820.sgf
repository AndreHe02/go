C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game. : )

-Thinking

Arlequin:
  The joseki at the top left gave you a bad opening (what was thinking your previous reviewer ?) but this is not what lost you the game.
  You lost because you had difficulties to manage too many weak groups.

Advices
 1 take care of cutting and getting cut.
 2 Protect your weak groups as soon as possible.
 3 Avoid making too many weak groups ! (point 1 and 2)
 4 Be ready to sacrifice stones or find alternative way of playing instead of running blindly.

 Hope this helps :)

(;W[bb]C[I tried this move instead of the joseki move at D17, because my last reviewer suggested it.]
;B[dc];W[cb];B[dd]C[But now that I look at it, I'm not really satisfied with this result.

I get shut off in the corner and lose connection with the E16 stone.

Arlequin:
yes, this result cannot be good for white.
white outside stone is cut, white corner is small and enclosed, while black strengh will work well with its corner enclosure at the bottom.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc]LB[bd:A]C[I'm alive in the corner so I decide to play elsewhere.

Should I have played elsewhere instead of the left side?

Arlequin:
 - invading the left side seems huge but it will be painful because of the corner weakness (see variation to move 19)
 - taking the stones at A is big, but probably too slow (see variation 1).
 - the last option is to play q10 to make a moyo contest, but black's moyo will certainly be bigger and stronger.

There is no very good alternative, the problem was the joseki at the top left.]

;W[lh]C[At the time, I liked the result even though my corner was hurt.

Reducing the black framework on the left looks easier now.

Arlequin:
Although black play was not perfect,
I think the corner is damaged too much. white might loose it, and even if it survives, white has not enough points to win the game.
Black wall destroying the corner is more usefull than the white wall in the center in my opinion.]
;B[oh];W[ni];B[pk]C[Arlequin:
this move does nothin, it just separate 2 strong white groups.
Black should attack the corner instead.];W[om]C[I played here because I thought it helps against R5 a bit.

Arlequin:
p7 is calm move especially against black r9 (the real menace for r5).
here q9 is too high to be such a threat I think, and even if it was, the top right corner is more urgent to help.]

Thank you for reviewing my game. : )])

what about escaping with the bottom group first (threatens black groups at the bottom) ?]
