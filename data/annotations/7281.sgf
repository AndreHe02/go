**Hi, I'm Johnny5, a 6 kyu on KGS, and I'll be doing a review of this game for you.  I'm aware that you want some guidance on how to deal with some particular corner approaches, but I'd also like to go over some of the other big issues in the game, that will help improve your game overall.**]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[de]C[**Remember, this is a handicap game, you need to be very aggressive.  A passive response like this is exactly what your opponent is wanting.  You should focus on taking sente and keeping it.**]

(;W[qp]C[I did choose this game to be commented because I did an action here 3 times that I really fear when others do it against me.
First time is this r4
Whenever I do that, I can easily form a living group. Whenever an opponent does that to me, he can form a living group... But I don't want my opponents to form living groups in my corner so easy, so I would like to get some advice on what can be done against such an action.

**This is not a very good move.  It is never a good idea to play contact moves like this unless you have stones to back you up.  Contacting the enemy will only make him stronger and force you to either try to make life or run to the center and make life.  Either way, you opponent will be controlling the situation and will almost certainly come out with a better end result in almost every case.**

**It would be better to play a normal corner approach as opposed to this.  I highly reccomend Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, which you can download for free online.  It has many different variations of corner plays which can be very useful.**]
;B[qq]C[*Black takes sente with the move and you now have to respond in order to save your stone.**]

[qq]SQ[rl][rm][qn][rn][qo][ro][qp][rp]C[**Once again, you will have to respond to save your stones.  Notice the difference in position between your two positions.  You can see how this is working extremely well for black's bottom side and works perfectly in conjuction with her bottom left stone.  On the flip side, you have two stones with no base and no safe position to run to.**]

[so][sp]C[formed a lving group in his corner

**Just a small mistake here.  It would have been better for you to take the three stones with move 31.  Also, this is still not a living group, and requires a stone at T5 to live.  Once you've done that, even though you have made a living group, look how little you have in comparison to black.  This is why that isn't a very good play.**

**What happens if black plays T5?**]

(;W[pc]SQ[de][ge]C[**Again, this is not a good play.  While you gain a very small amount of territory, your opponent is going to gain a lot more in influence and possibly even territory.  You need to work in conjunction with your stronger stones.**]

**I'd like to point out right now that the play at P19 is a mistake that normally would have lost you the entire corner.  I'll go ahead and show you what I'm talking about.  The correct play is Q18 or Q19.**]

I knwo he is just a 20 kyu, but I myself cannot defend against such an attack, too, so I really need to know what I can do against such an attack in my corner
( I recognized that I can prevent it when 1 play an additional 3-3 to my hoshi on 4-4, but that needs 1 move time. There need to be another way which is not that passive, right?)

**Once you get to higher levels of play, you won't see this much, if at all.  You have to remember to maintain focus on the entire board, because each and every play that you and your opponent make will have an effect on the entire board, not just where you are playing locally.  If you have opponents using this on you, let them, and take advantage of the huge amount of influence that you gain from forcing your opponent to live small in a corner.**

**Right now the entire center of the board could very easily become black territory if he played correctly.  A seemingly innocent attacking play at J14 could spell doom for your small group at Q9.**]
