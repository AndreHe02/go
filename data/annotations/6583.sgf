hello! My name is jero, as you can see i play with black in this game. I'd like to have some comments on how to improve my go and specially if i go the right direction at crucial points of the game.

****************************************************************************************
[Comments from DonPimpon\]
Hi Jero, in general, you play quite well for a 12k. You should quickly improve at least 3 stones very soon.
Let's take a look at the game.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qo]
;W[jq];B[de];W[gc];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]
(;B[ch]C[i almost don't know any joseki so i'm not sure if black 13 must be at C12 or C11 that's why i tried to play security.

-----------------------------

You played correctly here. C11 invites white to play C13 and cut/fight. See variation.]
;W[cj]
(;B[qi]C[Here you play too low. You should play as in the variation, on 4th line (see variation).
You are very strong here and should look for development at large scale.
The stone at Q11 would combine nicely with the shimari at R5. The proverb says that if you have played on 3rd line, the ideal combination should be on 4th line. 

In short: 
4th - 4th too high
3rd - 3rd too low
3rd - 4th combine well.];W[gp]
(;B[cq]C[this invasion at C3 is an example of direction of play that i would like a part of your comments to be about. (i mean if timing is correct or this is too soon or if the result is more positive for white since he has a lot of influence on both side and center)

------------------------------

In my opinion there are other bigger points on the board that you could consider first.
I think it's an error as white would block at C4 and make a big moyo with the help of C10 (see further comments on this at move 28).

See variation for better move.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]LB[fj:A]C[Follow up from move 17.

If white has the chance of playing at A, he has certainly succeeded in creating a large and strong moyo that would balance with your right side (which still is open to attack).

This is the consequence of invading at move 17. Please review the alternative at move 17.

White is very happy giving away the corner and that is what I would recommend you to do on the variation.]
;B[jc]LB[mc:A]C[i'm not sure K17 is right here...

-----------------------------------

This move depends on your playing style. This is certainly asking for a fight (that followed).
I like this kind of moves, but usually I play them against players of my own level. Remember that if you play against a stronger player, he will have the advantage in any fight and complex situation. That's why he is (still) stronger than you.

A less risky move and easier to play move is the one I already recommended before, the ogeima at A (like in move 17 on the variation).]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]
(;B[qf]C[This is too low and a mistake. Please see variation.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[le];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]C[In the end, you ended up giving away the corner anyway, so that's why my recommended move makes sense.

Now you have a group on the top that will have to live.

To be fair, this kind of moves for a 12k are still quite impressive and still good. But you want to improve, right?]
;W[rb];B[ge]C[from there i was clearly planning to make territory in the center trying to make influence on it before.

--------------------------------------

It's too late to do this because of the big influence that white has on the bottom. Any kind of territory in the center, will simply disappear.

At this point, black's potential territory won't increase much, meanwhile, white's will certainly increase in the bottom/centre.

I would say that black will keep the points it has and maybe add 10 more. White has much more potential and its points are safer too.

Let's see what happens next!];W[ql];B[pm]C[Good sequence of moves. In the appropriate direction.
Well done.];W[pk];B[oi]TR[nc][ne]C[It's a pity that the marked stones are destroying the points that you would be making for free thanks to this attack against white.

The biggest mistake was the invasion at C3. 

Your tactics are quite good, you don't make mistakes in that.
Your strategy is the weakest link here. you need a consistent plan. This can be gained by reading books or reviewing professional games. My advice would be to find a friend who is a strong player and give you some guidance.

It is very good that you don't make tactical mistakes, it's the way forward. You "just" need to improve your plan.

Play a hundred games and review them all after playing them. Look for the "losing move". If you do that, you will have a better plan in future games and quickly become stronger.

Good luck!!!

(more comments follow, so this is not the end of the review)]

;W[ml]TR[mm][nn][gp][eq][fq][jq][gr]C[As you can see, white has a plan.
He/she is building a moyo and making points.

I want you to do that. :)];B[mn];W[ln];B[mo];W[lo];B[hl]TR[de]
[ge][le][ch][li]SQ[dj][ej][fj][gj][hj][ij][jj][kj][lj][lk][ll]
[lm]C[another example of direction of play that i would like you to make comments about is this invasion.
(too far inside or not enough, too soon, is there another place on the board to be considered before?
I'm always trying to think of this but the answers are fuzzy most of the time. )

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here there are two concepts to take into account:

If you play close to the squared line, you are reducing.
If you play far from the squared line, you are invading.

How far is far?

I think the point you chose is just in the border, so I would say that it's a mild invasion or a risky reduction.

How risky it is?

It depends in how many directions you can run. If you take a look at the triangled stones, they are your "friends", if you run in their direction, you are "safe". 

When you can run in 2 or more directions, you are safe, so you can take more risk than normal.

However, if you can only run in 1 direction, then it is very high risk to be captured, and a mild reduction would be better.

In your case you have 3 directions to run to (top left, top and top right). So you are quite safe IF YOU INVADE 2 SPACES AWAY FROM THE SQUARED LINE. If you go deeper than 2 spaces, you will have to fight for your life and probably die.

I hope these rules help you in the future. You chose the right spot this time, do it again next time!]

You should be comfortable now and have an easy win. What happened?]

(;B[lp]C[Overplay. This cut does not work yet. If you had an additional stone at P4, it would have worked. See variation.]

Thanks for the tip, it happens to all of us. The stronger you are, the fewer mistakes you will make, but all of them will be dangerous.]

(;B[dr]C[Big mistake, the correct move is the one I've shown you 3 times already. It's a classical book position that I hope you'll remember from now on ;)
See variation.];W[br]C[and finally here i was quite tired (3am home) so i misread this sequence.
---------------------------

At least, you could have got a seki and still win by 6.5 points. (see variation).

I'm sure you'll progress very quickly into single-digit kyu.

Good luck!
