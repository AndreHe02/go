C[I'm dbstraight, playing black. This game was played on KGS.

(;B[ip]C[Was this move joseki?

F: I don't know about joseki, but I don't feel you come off better after the exchange.  If you push into the corner at D2 or even C2 if it works then that territory becomes yours rather than his - if he tries to pincer you then really all he'll be doing is creating a weak group of his own.]
;W[eq];B[er]C[F:  W wants to play at D2 anyway for good shape - if you care strongly about this small area of the board then you're going to have to protect at F2 anyway - why not take a shortcut and go straight there?  Then it will be he who has to respond to your moves - you gain sente.]
;W[dr];B[fr]C[F:  Interesting way of looking at sequences:  If you had played F2 first and W had responded with D2, would you have played E2?  If not, your moves are inefficient.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[oc];B[mc];W[oe];B[pf];W[kc]C[How should I have best responded to white's counter-pincer here?

F: Don't be afraid of sacrificing - if W is determined to capture your lone B stone, then you can use this against him.  If you can build a wall facing below in the following sequence whilst W captures your lone stone, then you've created a giant moyo which W will have to try to invade.]

(;B[me]C[Jumping out, while pressuring white's group here.

F: Always looks like W can escape with P14, which is going towards your potential territory.  Keep him outta there!]
;W[nf];B[mf]C[Trying to increase the pressure on white's group here, but it seems I may not be able to prevent the escape if white presses it enough. Perhaps it may have been better to try to escape from white's counter pincer.

F: Probably best to lightly skip away - contact moves like this have a few general consequences:
- making the opponent stronger elsewhere (towards your Q14 stone in this instance)
- making you stronger in the opposite direction (towards L17)
The latter is what forms the fundamental of a 'leaning attack' - lean on some stones in order to strengthen your position to attack in the opposite direction.  Unfortunately here you are also weakening your Q14 stones by leaning.]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[ci]C[F: Although the aim of your next moves are wise, W creates a large moyo here which you should be looking to invade directly on the side - the rest of the game pretty much helps W strengthen his position here.]
;B[je]C[F: This doesn't look right - too kind to W's lone stone, too close to your stones to be a respectable extension... Perhaps a more direct approach like J17 or K16, or even another leaning move like L16 would be more appropriate.  Your running group has a fair amount of escape routes still.]

;W[ee];B[ff]C[This isn't exactly an ideal position for influencing toward the center, but it seems ok. What do you think?

F: Well you've been pushing against a pretty strong group of stones so they've been happy to push back quite hard.  W has a weak group on the board - if you want to push something around then you'll find it doesn't resist very much (because if it did it would risk death!).  If you're worried about your centre B group having enough room to make two eyes then you can use the weak group to help you.  It can also help you build territory on the side.  Don't concentrate on killing it - just make sure your groups are happy and it will be subservient to them - if it is not then by all means punish it, but really you want the opponent to continue trying to save it so you can profit.  See variation.]

F: Indeed!  Threaten to isolate it - it's not going to get through into your lower territory, what is it really going to do, other than run for safety?]

;W[di]C[F: Again, don't be afraid to sacrifice - do you really want any white stones facing your open group above? I'd hane at E11 and go from there.]

(;B[ej];W[gi];B[gk];W[ij]C[F: Doesn't look good - but the knights jump has weaknesses, as does the two space jump above your stones, so before trying to make space for eyes you could try breaking through instead. This will have the side-effect of making your position more solid.]

dbstraight [16k\]: thanks for the game

After launching every counter attack I could find to try, my group still dies, so I resigned. I almost wonder now if I should've tried so hard to save it in the first place. CGoban's score estimator puts me only 15.5 points behind here even with the death of my group. In any event, it was a huge loss. Most of all I want to know if I could've saved it and how. Aside from that, how is my opening in general? What else could I have played to reduce white's territory that wouldn't have led to such a messy fight?


F: You could definitely have saved the group - try to be more threatening with your moves; threaten to connect, threaten to capture, and then the eyespace should form much easier.  Remember to pressurise the opponent's weak groups - the P15 stones had a really easy time of it compared to your weak group, it seems this could've simply been because there wasn't much attention paid to them - if he had been valiantly trying to defend them, then maybe they would've attracted your attention and maybe been killed.  Killing the weak groups shouldn't be your aim, but to gain from attacking them, and then punishing them for not being adequately defensive.  Even at this point in the game, a move at O13, P11 or O11 could stop his groups from connecting and put them in trouble.  Every move here could be used as a KO threat, so if he doesn't respond, you could kill... thus trading your E8 group for his P15 group.  Score estimator thinks his group is dead anyway, hence why the score is fairly close.  Gain a few points around F16 and you could be back in it...

Regarding the opening, it looks okay, but it's almost like you forget about the top right + right hand side completely once you've secured some space for your N14 group.  W has a weak group sitting there for a long time unpressured, when adding pressure to it should be where the flow of the game takes you (the by-product of his counter-pincer).  There's also a big area around R7 left undeveloped for a long time, eventually W takes this area and instead of it meaning he has two weak groups, he manages to just about link up with his other weak group forming (just about) one big safe group - disaster!

Maybe if you treated your stones a bit lighter, kept your options open, sacrificed where it'd help your main objective, and pressured your opponents weak groups, you'd find yourself winning more.  Good luck!]
