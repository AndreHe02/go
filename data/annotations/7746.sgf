C[In this game, I saw that black had a very large teratory at the top, but i was affraid to invade it.  Instead I attacked some weak stones and managed to make some teritory in the center, then I attacked both of Black's corners from the 3,3 point.  I thought I was going to win by about 20, but I only won by 5.5, so I had underestimated the amount of teritory Black had at the top.  Looking back at the game, other than the decision not to invade, I felt like I just kept chipping away at Black and was able to do so because all of my groups had a decent base to work from and were mostly safe from being invaded themselves.  I would have probably lost if Black had secured either corner from invasion.

Anyway, that was my general take on the game.  I'd be curious to see what a stronger player notices.

A: Hi Eric, 

this is my first review. I'm only a 6K but I play and study a lot. remember that some of my comments are from a 6k point of view and might be wrong. :) I will do my best. 
Also, i'm not the nest speller. sorry in advance.];B[dp]C[enmartin [12k\]: hi]

All in all i think you play a very nice conservitive style. You keep your groups safe. i think that is going to be an asset as you improve. Here are a few thoughts that I have. 

1. try to keep sente a bit more. 
2. try playing a bit more open in at the start of the game. Try to avoid touching your opponant's stones at the start
3. try to wait until the end before playing end game moves. 

 Anyway, I hope that helps. 

Feel free to email me if you have any comments or questions.
