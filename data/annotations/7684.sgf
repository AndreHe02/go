Dear reviewer

Please review for the white player (SaurusDNA).

There are three black plays that I specifically struggled with - namely the black reduction at move 23. b-h4, the deep invasion at move 51. b-g17, and the powerful 85. b-j13.

Black's move 85,  b-j13 effectively killed all my potential for further territory, and I feel that perhaps I played in the wrong areas between move 65 and move 85.

Please could you give me guidelines on how to handle plays such as these. Also, after the first two invasions, I was about 10 points behind,but I do feel I still had some potential until black killed it all with 85. b-j13.

Could you please also assess my position at around move 65-85, and suggest a way in which I might have caught up the 10 points, if it was at all possible.

I have also asked a few specific questions during the game, and please also do comment if you see something that I've overlooked completely during my game, or any suggestions where I might improve my play.

Many thanks

A is my favorite, or around... O16 to look up for territory or influence that suports the upper left corner and prepare strike over C13

B: Interesting because is dangerous to black alow C4

C: Seeks brake the black´s potencial if plays here

D and E: The propuse is cause a clamp, to raise a counter attack

F: seems worg to me... the force built at the left is used too soon, is recomended play far from the force to maximize their potencial]

You pick an option that matchs you style... but was extremly shy... look the variations]

Wrong thought, but right move... now your group needs base]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[im];W[no];B[pq];W[gn]C[I played this move, trying to make a little territory from chasing black, but maybe it is too small?

Yes, is too small, you are keeping 10 points at the most, the options commenten early in this game looks more promising]
;B[hn];W[gl];B[go]C[Here, attention... you already invest 2 moves in that, you cant let this go away, specially in this case because you have sente later.]

;W[bd];B[ad];W[jd]C[Perhaps I should have played b17 first, but I did not want to take gote, because I'm already behind. What was the correct play here?

i think not, because you are using your sente with a move that can be ignored]
;B[gc]TR[bc][dj][bn][fo]C[This must be an overplay, but it became a huge headache for me, especially with a16 open. How should I deal with this invasion? 
See the variations

In fact overplay, is a response to the points that black tan take (see the marks)]

(;W[pb];B[fn];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[pn];W[og];B[ig]C[This move killed any potential for further territory for white.

I am now 10 points behind, and remained 10 points behind for the remainder of the game, and eventually lost by 8 points. In a way, it's as if yose started here.

I think this is another key point in the game.
Do you see any areas that I might have caught up the 10 points before or after b-j13?

The rest of the game was uneventful, and the status remained the same until the end, so this is the last question that I have on this game, unless you see something that I have overlooked.

Many thanks

Black wins by 7.5 points


I hope help your game, 2 big things

1. Dont be afraid to fight a little or made trades.
2. In the yose keep your sente as long as you can... some moves are not big for the points, ther are because let you do another.


PD: Excuse my ortographics mistakes, if you need any clarifications i ll be happy to do it.]
