C[df: I'm your reviewer.  Center territory is very hard to solidify, and usually ends up smaller than it looks.  Focus on surrounding weak groups and making them live locally in gote, or making them run through dame near yuor own strong group.

Hi, thanks for reviewing my game. My main questions about the game will be:

1) How to solidify center territtory (the moment i use my sente to secure it, i get pushed to the defensive and end up with only a tiny plot of territory. If i play closer to the opponent's stones to force him to defend, he counter attacks and my potential center territory and his potential side territory are lost, but since my center is bigger, its worse off for me)


2) How to attack weak groups (how to respond to move 122)

The questions are not exhaustive. Please feel free to add any other comments as you see fit.]

;B[dr];W[co]C[I cannot find this move in any joseki dictionaries. In these situations, by my experience, the move MUST be a joseki, even if its an obscure one, or there is a way to make the opponent suffer. I'm not too sure if my follow up is correct in this case.

df: white's move is bad, and your answer is fine, connecting your stones.]
;B[er];W[cj]
(;B[jq]C[df: The large open areas are on the top and right side.   If you give white L3 and take two big moves elsewhere it should work out well for you.]
;W[fp]C[df: you want to attack the H3 stone, and your corner is strong, so you can hane to cut right away.  It's important that you either capture H3, or get out into the center.  If you stay conencted to the center and H3 is isolated, your attack is much, much stronger.]

;B[go];W[ep]C[Now what should black do?

df: this is not a good result for black.  the stones are floating in the center, and the K3 stone is low on liberties.]
;B[io]C[apparently, this was a bad idea. But it was either this or give up the H4 cluster. Is there a better way for black to play?

df: you needed to play G4 earlier, or take a big move instead of K3.  Your center group is too big to sacrifice, but saving it will be a burden, and should give white life on the bottom.]
;W[jp];B[kq]C[any comments on this move?

df: optimistic.   White will come out and attack the group in the center]
;W[hr];B[gs]C[and this?

df: this is good.  You need to save the cutting stones.];W[jo]

(;B[no]C[the N3 "wrong move" was so that i could take the corner, but after i used my sente to play O5, I ended up on the defensive again.

df: O5 is on the wrong side.  You need to defend your weak group in the center.  This move doesn't take many corner points, so it's small.]
;W[ln];B[il];W[qo]C[df: black is so thick here this must be an overplay.  Don't play close to thickness.  Attacking this group will get you territory in the left and center.]
;B[ql]C[i think this is correct, but is a more forceful play (i.e. Q7) possible?

df: I thnk both are possible.  The main thing to ficus on is making white live small, making thickness in sente.]
;W[rm]
(;B[fc]C[was tenuki correct? Or should i have continued to force the R5 cluster?

df: tenuki is not correct.  You are very thick and white is weak so you should attack.  You might kill the group, but certainly you can make it live in gote while making outside thickness facing your 4-4 point stone above.]
;W[rl]C[I thought it was a slow move, but on hindsight, it settled the R5 group and perhaps my tenuki was wrong?

df: the tenuki was wrong.  This move is not slow since you have a potetially huge framework here.]
;B[qj];W[qm];B[pl];W[pm]
(;B[nm]C[df: this move looks ok, but I wold prefer to play P8 to get more liberties.]
;W[rk]
(;B[cf]C[tenuki again.

df: since you can attack the weak group with sente, you can get free moves on the right, and still come back to get this move.

df: I would prefer to play on the upper side.  you are building a big framework in the upper right.  most likely this move gets you the corner in exchange for making white thick.  White thickness here makes it harder for you make center territory from your framework.  If you get a good center framework, you might want to play some move like E13 with sente.  After white gets thick here those moves are gone.]
;W[df];B[cc]C[i remember reading something about this being a bad move when there's a stone on C10, but I can't really remember it. what's wrong with this move? Or is D13 the wrong move?]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[db]C[is C13 better?];W[bf]
;B[eb];W[bd];B[bc];W[ae]C[df: now white is thick here, and can easily jump into the center or run away with an invasion.  This result is inconsistent with your center framework strategy.]
;B[em];W[cl];B[ej]C[I was trying to seal white in, but is E10 too far? is E9 better? or E11?

df: I like this move best locally, but I would still prefer to attack the right side group first.]
;W[ll]C[df: if white can jump into the center here, your move at e10 doesn't get much.]
;B[rq]C[aiming for the R5 cluster again.];W[nc];B[pf]C[i think this was a wrong move

df: I like it.];W[qh]C[now what should black do?];B[rj]C[didnt read deeply enough. very bad move by black

df: this feels like the only move to me.];W[qk]
(;B[pk]C[df: you might consider giving up the two stones below rather than the stones at S10.  Then white would have two weak groups and you can get a splitting attack.  The stones at Q8 are not cutting stones so they are less important than the stones at R10.]
;W[pj]
(;B[qg]C[was this move correct? after the Q10 move i didn't know what to do]
;W[qi];B[oj];W[pi];B[lc];W[ne];B[id];W[om]C[bad move by white. now M7 is possible]

C[df; very good play by black here, to get a solid wall in sente, then cut to make a huge center framework.  This sequence wins the game.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[km];W[mn];B[ml];W[nb]C[Now what should black do?

df: your approach is correct.  Cut white off, and force the group to run through dame while you make territory on both sides.  This is enough to win.  You could try peeping first to attack more forcefully, but your center is still open on the left, so if white connects you might not get any more than you did in the game.]
(;B[oa];W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jd]C[i understand what when attacking, you are only supposed to harrass and make profit elsewhere. but when are the moves "correct" and when are they "not forceful enough"?

I played this sequence to make profit at the top, but i think white made life too easily.

df: a simple idea is that if you can read out a killing sequence with confidence, then play to kill.  Otherwise play to attack in a way to gains something, and also keep sente.  If you attack too hard, you will have to end with a defensive move yourself and give away sente.  Choode between two kinds of sente attack, either surround the enemy so he lives in gote, or make him run through dame while you make points or thickness.]

How should black have played?

is there any way, other than to give up the Q8 cluster, for black to have played better?

df: This was a pretty even trade.  If you read it all when you decided not to defent at O13, you are quite strong.]

df; there is no no point in making a ko here.  If you win, you gain nothing since whit has to connect at a10 later anyway.  But losing the ko costs you several points.  And a ko fight make sthe game more complex.  When you are ahead you should be trying make the game simpler.]
