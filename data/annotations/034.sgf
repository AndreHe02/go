(;B[jc]C[This move feels a little
slow. And it goes against
the proverb 'Don't make
territory with thickness'.
I would prefer s.th. like
the variation at the previous

for b. The white stone c11 is in a perfect position.
Instead of c14 black should play something like
d16, c16, e17 ...];B[cn]C[Here I think it's easier
for white to play c8.

things. If you have a carefull
look on the board I think there
is no need for this. It hurts
your group around s12. Simply
playing sente endgame moves
should lead to victory. For
instance s9 also stabilises
your group. After this the score

is roughly equal, but white has
superior thickness.];B[qn];W[rp];B[rm];W[qq];B[pp];W[pr];B[rr];W[or];B[rq]

[ir];B[gs];W[jl]C[h10 is much thicker. It would
help s12 group more. White should
not fear the two black stones start moving. He rather should  welcome this. :-)  The worst thing which could happen is that white has to  sacrifice the four stones around h10.  But this would hurt blacks possibillities in making territory around o14.]
;B[hj];W[ij]C[j9 is better];B[ik];W[il];B[gl];W[fn];B[hl];W[im]C[k9! The cut doesn't work
for black.];B[jk];W[gf];B[hf];W[fe];B[he]C[This result is terrible for white. The territorial balance has  changed sligtly in blacks favor. Much more importand is all the thickness  is now in blacks hands. And s12 group is weak like a piece of butter  in the desert. (At high noon, not at night :-) )
One is tempted to live at t14, orplay at o10. But then black has clearly  more territory.
The conclusion is you lost the game in the fight in the midle.
Overlooking the damezumari of the stones f7,f8,g9,h9 was a decicive taktical  blunder.]

You missed to take a firm grip on one of the two black groups on the left.  Preferably the lower on :-). Move 86 on g12 would have ended the game.
In the later part of your games you should try to do a calm judgement  
of the board and not overplay your position (like s6) if it's not necessary.]
