C[This is a game I played on Tygem recently.
I'm a KGS 6 kyu but constantly lose on tygem against 14 kyus. I think I played well at the beginning but then I made one mistake after the other.
I don't really have much questions but I'm not sure what I did wrong except those total obvious mistakes that killed my groups^^

Any directions on what went wrong would be nice, thanks for you time in advance.]
;B[pp]C[Zwergesel: Hi, I'm your reviewer for this game. My Go has become a little rusty, because I didn't play much recently, but I will do my best to help you!
However remember that I'm only around 4 ranks stronger than you on kgs, so don't take everything I say as absolute truth. ;)]

(;B[lc];W[pf]C[After the game I found a professional game with these 16 moves played in the same order, so I think that should be fine.

Zwergesel: Good. Keeping black shut in.];B[pg];W[qe];B[re];W[qg]
;B[rf];W[of];B[fc]CR[pg]LB[oh:A]C[I wasn't sure how to answer this, F16 or a pincer where my first thoughts but I backed off instead.

Zwergesel: The only thing that might discourage a pincer is the weakness at A. However, I believe that a pincer is still the strongest move here. Black has overextended himself. C14 is not a bad move, but it's making things too easy for black.]
(;W[cf];B[id]C[Zwergesel: Black happily plays here to become strong and safe.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[bp];B[cq];W[en]C[I played this jump to protect possible invasions, but Black invaded anyway.
After this jump I thought it's pretty equal.

Zwergesel: I agree. Note that the jump does not only help protect against invasions, it also limits black's potential on the bottom (while increasing your's on the left).]
;B[cj]C[Here I was not sure how to answer this.

Zwergesel: The invasion cannot be killed, but you will gain strong influence in the center at the cost of a few points. You get to choose towards which side you want to push him by playing either C9 or C11.]
;W[ck]C[The hane seemed the best because I thought if he plays C11 I can connect at D9 and Black needs to escape, so I get sente.]
;B[ci]
(;W[db]TR[dd][cf]C[But I couldn't connect like i wanted to because I thought if Black jumps into the corener my to-left group will die.
So I closed the corner instead, was this a mistake and should I have just connected like I wanted to?

Zwergesel: He's in no position to kill your marked stones. He has to worry about his own stones first. See variations.]
;B[bk];W[cl];B[di];W[ej];B[bl]C[This hurt me and I lost much here, my only choice would be an invasion somewhere.]
(;W[hq]C[I have chosen this because I have a strong group near and i might connect up.]
;B[hp]
(;W[fq]C[Zwergesel: I believe that this is the wrong move order. J3 should come first to see his reaction (K4 or J4). A friendly 1 dan I asked recommended the hane.]

;W[cr];B[ip];W[bq]C[I was very happy with this result, now I'm ahead I think.

Zwergesel: Yes, a good result. Especially since you're connected and don't have to worry about an attack on the left side.]
;B[eb]C[Not sure what Black want here, but I felt I should answer it.

Zwergesel: see variation.]
(;W[ec]LB[cc:B][dc:C][ec:A]C[Zwergesel: Seeing what happened later in the game: You have two choices to defend here: A is sente, but leaves aji in the corner. B is gote, but removes the aji and makes a black endgame at D19 gote. C defends in gote, but leaves sente endgame at D19. I don't think there's ever a reason to play C in this exact corner position.]
;B[fb];W[fd];B[gd]
(;W[bh]C[Zwergesel: Better play from a distance (see variation). After B11 you owe a move here, which either gives you gote or makes B12 meaningless.]
;B[bi];W[oh]LB[nn:A]C[74 is a move I wanted to play for a long time, now I'm very confident that I'm leading and have no weak groups that can be attacked.

Zwergesel: It's a good move. It's hard to get the timing of it right. Personally, I think I'd probably play A first since it's big for both sides.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[qm];B[ol]C[Black got a nice wall, could I have prevented this?

Zwergesel: I don't think so, but you gained sente and you can easily reduce the potential black territory.]
;W[kl]C[Here I was trying to reduce Black a bit, but I didn't wanted to go in too far.

Zwergesel: Good.];B[il]C[This looks like an overplay to me, there is no way Black can kill off the stone. My plan was to jump to L10 but...]
;W[gl]C[I somehow thought my left group is in trouble, I forgot it was connected to the corner.

Zwergesel: Yes, you're connected so you could have played on the other side.]

;B[jj];W[kj];B[ki];W[li];B[lh];W[kh];B[ji];W[lj];B[lg];W[ni]
C[now my stones are connected and save, I reduced Black sucessfully but Black now builds a new area at the top. Now I was sure I'm behind and I don't see how I can invade or reduce it. What can  do here?

Zwergesel: You answered that yourself: Don't play G8. There are many ways this fight could go, but most results after G8 will be similar to this.]
;B[ge]C[Zwergesel: Black should play atari.];W[jc]LB[ld:D][gg:A]
[hi:B][ln:C]C[This was the only weakness I could see.

Zwergesel: Not a weakness. Better reduce the center. You're not that far behind.]
;B[kd]C[But after 101 White's stone is dead, it also can't connect underneath like I tryed...]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[mc];B[kb];W[kc];B[ld];W[nb];B[la]C[This was just bad and from here one I just kept making mistakes.

;W[rq]C[I played this because the is nothing big left, the game is over but I wasn't sure what I did wrong.
I continued to play in the hope that I can get some points in the endgame and maybe my loss will be only by 10 points.]
;B[cb]C[I thought this didn't work so...];W[da];B[cc]C[... but now I see that I'm in trouble.]
;W[cd]C[I thought a long time on this move, I belive most of my time was used here, at least all my byoyomi periods where used up here.]
;B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[be]C[So a ko was the best I could find, was there a better way to live?

Zwergesel: Ko is the best you can do. (Last comment before the end)]

;B[qb];W[rg];B[ra];W[sc];B[ob];W[pa];B[oa];W[na];B[pb]C[And I failed, I wanted to resing here but I thought the game is almost over so I finish this now.]

;W[ne];B[lf];W[nf];B[lm];W[mm];B[ml];W[km];B[ll];W[qs];B[ps]
C[Another mistake... Here I resinged continuing would be pointless.

Zwergesel: Your opening was strong, but then I think you overreacted when you thought you were falling behind, making more mistakes as a result and eventually getting crushed in the endgame. However, for a long time you were not as far behind as your comments implied. Don't get desperate when you make a few small mistakes â€“ stay calm and try to catch up with reasonable moves. You'd be surprised how many points you can gain with a strong midgame/endgame.]
