;B[pd];W[pp];B[ec];W[dp];B[kc];W[de]C[pem: 3-5 point (E17) josekis are not played very often, so I don't know very much about this. D15 is one approach though, C16 and C17 are two other alternatives.]
;B[cg];W[fe];B[eg];W[cc];B[gc];W[gf]C[pem: It seems to me that the white stones are left a bit unsettled after this, but the 3-3 stone should at least keep them alive. Perhaps White should exchange C14 first (with the drawback that Black gets stronger, but he ends up pretty strong now anyway.)]
;B[ck];W[cm];B[qn];W[ql]C[pem: Pincer too tight without backup around K4. R10 or Q9 are the normal pincers here. Simply O4 is not a bad move either.]
;B[on];W[np];B[qk]C[pem: Black R10 or Q9 are perhaps the more popular moves here.]
;W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[qi]
(;W[rl]C[pem: This isn't reasonable with the Q8 cutting point which must be protected first. Maybe a simple connection is best? (See variation.)]
;B[pl];W[pm]C[pem: Giving up the Q9 stones doesn't seem like a good idea, Black would benefit too much, but Q7 is strengthening Black and putting weaking the Q9 stones. P8 is perhaps better?]

C[pem: R12 first?];B[qg];W[qc]C[pem: It's necessary to invade the corner, but perhaps White should move out more with the unsettled Q9 group first. Black is not likely to just defend the corner in gote, he will follow with the P8 group.]
;B[qd]C[pem: Defend the wider side, that is, Q17.];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc]

C[pem: I think White can push with R4 first.];B[qr];W[pr];B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[pem: Simply descending to D3 would defend the corner and actually put more pressure on the single black stone. Here a pincer would work as well. Black will either live small along the edge or in the corner, but White should be compensated in either case. (See variations to this move.)]

[ml];W[nl]C[pem: I can't see the purpose of this move. It's not helping the heavy Q9 group, which must keep on running. White should just move out, possibly using the threat of the cutting points N17, P16, R15 Black has left there, to get either eyes or connecting towards the left.]

;B[ji];W[lk];B[mj];W[mk];B[jg];W[kg]C[pem: The L12 stones are as good as captured. In any case Black will gain from chasing them.]

[od];W[rf];B[nf];W[mc];B[md];W[jj];B[jh];W[db]C[pem: At this point Black has a big lead in territory, and only one weakish group (C9-13). White has 2-3 weak groups (upper left, center and lower right). White must somehow attack what weaknesses Black has and strengthen his groups in the process. A very difficult task at this stage.]
;B[eb];W[gh]C[pem: This is only running, without putting any pressure on Black. I think White must go for the invasion at C11, which will lead to a difficult and hairy fight...]

[os];B[or];W[qs];B[oq];W[nr];B[rs];W[ps];B[pg];W[he];B[qf];C[pem:  I think White lost this game very early, first by playing a tight pincer (White 16) which in itself need not be bad but then getting cut by Black 25. This left White with a heavy group at Q9 which really should be abandoned, but as the board stood, this wasn't easy.
After this both players played fairly well, but White kept paying for the early mistake, having more weaknesses and being one step behind, while Black was strong all over and really didn't have much to worry about.]

(;W[dq]N[Variation 1]C[pem: Simply big. Black has to get a life or move out.]
;B[iq]C[pem: If further away, White will invade between the two stones.]

(;W[hq]N[Variation 2]C[pem: A pincer and an extension from White's thickness on the right. Black can move out or go for the corner.]
;B[cq]C[pem: Actually, Black D3 is an alternative, but I will not go into such complications.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bn];W[ho]C[pem: ...or F4, F5, or elsewhere. Just watch it so the F3 stone doesn't come loose.]

;B[rl];W[rm];B[qm];W[rk];B[rn];W[sl]C[pem: From here, it's a running battle between the two R7 and R8 groups. (Which is almost inevitable after the pincer play.)]
