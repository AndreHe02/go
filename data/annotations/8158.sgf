C[Hi. I'm Shashwat, NR; White. I think my rank is probably 17-20kyu \\
on smaller 13x13, 9x9 boards. I haven't studied Fuseki/ Openings \\
yet, so I am quite weak on 19x19.

I was playing a match against slizard, NR.


paul:  To differentiate from your comments, I will begin all of mine with my name (as on this line).  The SGF, as I received it, seemed to have two errors in it regarding "NR" tokens in the SGF.  I do not know what they are, but they appear to have turned up in this node as curious comment markers.  They seem to have surrounding punctuation in your comment, so I'm assuming they were meant to be some kind of markdown... who knows.]
;B[pd];W[ee]C[paul: you asked specifically about fuseki, so I will try to comment on that.  Though, I should warn you that my understanding of fuseki is noticibly 10kyu.

This move at E15 is unusual in games at my level because it is difficult to use effectively.  It has very little effect on the corner -- where people usually start to build territory at my level.

It does have important effects on the rest of the board by projecting influence and power.]
;B[pq];W[ep];B[pk];W[jj]C[paul:  I don't really understand this move.  Again, my fuseki is rather weak, but so far to me it looks like black has made a defendable moyo and white has not.  White seems to be all influence with nothing to defend.  My understanding is that this can be OK if you intended to play a fighting game, but I personally find it very difficult to make territory when I begin this way.

Fuseki is mostly a game of metaphores though.  It is not a solved problem, so humans adds anecdote and story to the positions to try to make sense of them.  It's very subtle.  But the traditional plan is to try to grab the corners, then the sides, then fight over the middle, then dispute the boundaries (middle game), then finish up (end game).]

;B[bb];W[cb];B[cc];W[db];B[fc]C[paul: Here you've begun to build the moyo you started with the pure influence moves.  Better to let black live on the third line over there and make a giant moyo instead of trying so desperately to kill black.]
(;W[hc];B[gc];W[gd]C[paul: I noticed this hane looks rather like the crosscut from my variations at move 37.  note that the essential differnce is that he's connected to an alive group and the white of move 38 (in variation) is not.  That's a pretty important difference.

Anyway, up ahead is a note about surrounding too closely and how you shouldn't do it.  A better way to stop black from spreading out here (if you even want to do that, see comment in variation at move 28); is to build some strength first.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[ge];W[fd];B[ic];W[hb];B[ib];W[jc]
;B[gb];W[ha];B[ia]C[paul: I think the problem with this whole encounter is "playing too close."  Whenever you touch your opponent, you start at a disadvantage.  Touching should be used for running away, or to make things more complciated (if you think you have better reading skills and you're in a handicap came).  If you're touching to attack or surround, you'll ultimately fail in your goals.

See the vairation.]

paul: I'm not sure the mistake was here.  See the variations at move 67 (comment at move 94 there).  The problem you have at this point in the game is that you have 3 weak groups (none is certainly alive, one is hopefully alive) and one fuseki stone projecting influence toward an alive black group and a strong-ish black stone.  

Not a lot to go on.  At this point in the game, it actually looks to me like black already won the game -- although it's much too early to say.]

paul: maybe insteaad of move 200 ...

If you go back far enough, you should be trying to make some territory rather than just trying to live.  If you live in that small space, you make two points of territory, but you used nearly 20 stones to do it.  With each move, up until the middle game or there abouts, you should be looking for moves that make 10 or 15 points with each move.  It's best if you can find moves that make 10 points while *also* being something your opponent has to respond to.  The very best moves can even do three thigns at once ... or more.]

(;W[kj]C[paul: let that stone go.  The pseudo-kikashi of move G10 wasn't really useful, so there's no sense preserving a connection to it.   Also, J11 is just one stone.  leave it be so you can sorta save this smallish group in the middle, if you desire to do that.  Although, note that at this point in the game, things look rather bleak for white.  Black has nearly surrounded the lower left and the upper right is almost certainly black's as well.]

(;W[jr];B[ir];W[kp];B[ko];W[jo];B[io];W[jn]TR[ep]C[paul: I'm not sure this is better, since now your original fuseki stone is projecting influence directly at a black wall.  :(

Perhaps there is no good solution.  Groups in the middle of the board tend to not do so well.  Even when they live, they usually don't net much profit.  That whole middle group is worth barely 20 points I imagine (although I didn't actually count it).]

It's hard to do something useful with that stone up at e4 once it's not useful for influence anymore.]

As a rule, you shouldn't cooperate with your opponenet when they're building 4th line territory.  There may have been a better way to try to live over there.  Normally when you have a wall, .. you use it to attack.]

(;W[pf]LB[pb:A][nc:B]TR[jb][jc][id][ie][jf][ig]SQ[pd][pi]C[paul: I like this idea over the original move 66.  It might be a bad idea because it's playing between the black stones...  Who could say.  But I like the idea because it logically follows from having the wall (triangles) nearby for support and it seems to try to divide the black stones (squares).

Another idea might be at Q18 (a) or O17 (b).  I have a hard time picking invasion points myself, but making territory from thickness directly is usually a bad idea except as a last resort.]

[fb]C[Paul: This is comical, but rather unlikely to happen.  Most likely black will notice the ensuing oiotoshi before you actually get to execute the kill.  So pretend that didn't happen.


What is very important to note is that it really doesn't matter that you ate away the eyes of that formation.  Notice that the black shape is still unconditionally alive.  Black has eyes at B17 (triangle) and the area with the white stones in it (squares).

In effect, all you did with your moves 58, 60, and 62, is give black a few free captures!]

;B[qe]LB[pc:B][od:A][qd:C][oe:1][re:E][pf:2][qf:D]C[paul: black's next move is to hane.  white is already losing this fight and it's only move two.  The next move in this sequence would probably be at C -- it's known as the cross-cut.  In handicap games, you see it a lot.  White uses it to make the fight complicated.  In an even game, white is probably either running or trying to make sabaki, but in any case, black has the advantage.

I've run some possible followups.  Note that the proverb says to "always extend from a crosscut" -- they mean nobi.  And there's another proverb: if you don't know which way to extend, you don't get it yet (although I'm paraphrasing).

Anyway, the idea to stop black from spreading is to "surround at a distance."]

I'm not sure it's a good way to proceed, since you're not likely to make much territory from your own stones on the third line and it also destroys your potential for making that huge moyo with your first three moves.  But this might be a way to do it.

I like the approch shown in the first variation (comment at move 28) much better.
