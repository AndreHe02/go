;B[pd]C[Hello there.  As I understand it, I'll be reviewing black's side.  This is my first ever review on GTL, so please bear with me.  I'll try to make it understandable. :)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
(;B[qj]C[This is a good move, it strikes a balance between territory and influence.  But there's an arguably better move on the board right now.

You may already know the following, but if you don't it's critical to know.  Most typically when a player plays on the 3rd line the player is going to make territory on the edge of the board.  Whereas if you play on the 4th line you're expecting to influence other areas of the board, not (and this is critical to know) make territory.  It's far too easy for an enemy group to sneak below you on the 4th line, in most situations, to count on it solidly as territory.]
;W[ci];B[jq];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq];W[lq];B[gq]C[In this exchange you got the better end of the deal.  Black is very big on the right and has a solid base on the bottom.  Whereas white is squeezed.  O3 was probably a mistake for white.]
;W[fq]C[One thing to know about playing off a stone is it's used for defense.  White is trying to push against black to make a very large corner.]
(;B[fp]C[I wouldn't have played the hane in this situation because the crosscut looks problematic.  See variation of move 16 for details.  See variation of this move for what I would have played instead.]
(;W[eq]
(;B[en]C[This move seems really small and doesn't address the weakness of the possible cross cut.  I'm unsure what you were trying to accomplish with this move.]
;W[gp]C[White takes the crosscut.];B[co]C[This move is abandoning your base on the bottom.]
;W[cp];B[dr]TR[en][co][fp][gq]SQ[cp][dp][eq][fq]C[This invasion is a bit reckless.  Combined with your recent moves you've managed to cut your groups to pieces.  White's pieces are in a strong group.  Whereas your pieces aren't connected with each other.  While B5, E6, and F4 are in a good shape (It's called the Big Bulge shape) it does little to counter white's very solid shape.]
;W[cr];B[cl]C[It's good you jumped out, you need to build a base.]
;W[fo]
(;B[cg]C[I would have approached the corner instead. See variation.]
;W[ce];B[hp]SQ[cg]C[It's best to think of moves in go in pairs.  White is certain to respond to this,  What do you get from white responding?

But beyond that, what are you going to do about that poor stone you just stranded out in the middle of nowhere?]
;W[go]C[By playing 27 you allowed white to increase his influence while eliminating a weakness in his group and as a side effect it makes your stones weaker.  This type of move is called a "Thank you" move.  White is thanking you for making that move.  You don't want your opponent to like you that much. :)]
;B[eg];W[hq]
(;B[gc]C[You're going to have to do something about your group on the bottom before you lose all of those stones.  You should always play an urgent move before a big move.  It's critical you help those stones right now, it can't wait.

Beyond that.  Remember when I said that approaching a 3-4 from the wrong way is tough.  It really is tough and not very effective.  You should only attempt in rare situations where you get something big out of it elsewhere.]
;W[ip];B[jc];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[ph]SQ[hp]C[This move is double purpose.  First, it threatens invasion.  But second, it breaks a ladder that was good for black (marked with square.)]
(;B[bc]SQ[ee][fe][ge][he]C[Hmm... this invasion is bound to fail.  But even if white makes an error and you survive, the general outcome of an invation is black gets the territory and white gets the influence to the outside.

But what's outside of white's stones?  Your stones! Specifically two groups, both unsettled.  If you succeed with this invasion you're going to push white right between your two groups and ruin your position.  (Which you gave up the entire bottom on the board for.)]

[sp][rq][sq]C[1986: i feel like this is good for black i never played a opening this light  before its usually just a basic opening i feel like this is more of a better fit for me

Michael: Well, at this point I get the feeling that white is bigger than black.  Both in terms of territory an influence.  I marked white's probable territory using circles and black's using squares.  Currently, white also has lots of influence on the center from his powerful bottom group.  This isn't to say black couldn't come back.  You have a lot of solid territory, and white still has some weak groups to chase.]
;W[oe];B[qh];W[qi];B[pi];W[qg]
(;B[ri]C[See variation for a better way that keeps your groups together.]
;W[rh];B[oh];W[qi];B[oj]C[After this exchange the ladder I mentioned before is good for black again.]
;W[pf]
(;B[qe]C[You shouldn't have responded to white's move.  You should have taken back to ko.  See variation.]
;W[qh];B[sj]TR[qg][ph][qh][rh][qi]C[It's important to protect S11.  But it's probably better to do it with S10.  The problem with T10 is that you're leaving behind a rather sizable ko threat at S9.]
(;W[sd]C[Biiiiiiiig monkey jump.  It's too big.  You can only jump 2 spaces and sometimes only 1!  3 almost never works.  See variation to punish.]
(;B[me]C[This is a nice threat to cut white's group into two.  (Which you never followed through on.  See variation of move 59.)]
;W[kn]C[White covers the ladder again, and uses his influence to spread to the center.]
(;B[kl]TR[ci][fo][go][gp][ip]C[I see what you're trying to do and it's a good idea.  But you have a few too many weaknesses in your moyo to claim this much territory right now.  I've marked them so you can see where you need to cover up.]
(;W[ho]C[At this point the ladder was still good for white.  I don't know why he took it, other than perhaps just so he could stop worrying about it.]
(;B[ml]C[I would have pushed white the other way.  Right now your groups in that area are weak.  Driving white through there is a bad idea.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[on];B[pm]C[Nice exchange!];W[ne];B[mf];W[nh]
;B[ng];W[ni]
(;B[li]TR[nh][ni]C[I can tell you were worried about white making a nice mess of your moyo.  But right now it's more important to take care of your group.  Because you don't want to lose your right edge of the board.  You can squeeze whatever those two stones become later and profit every step of the way.]
;W[oi];B[pj];W[og]
(;B[fe]C[Rather than playing this move to directly make more moyo (you don't need more moyo here.)  I think it would be nicer to attack the white stone at C11.  See variation.]
;W[ei]
(;B[da]C[For a corner invasion D18 would be better.  But there are bigger moves on the board.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[ca];B[cb]C[You don't have enough room in the corner to make life anymore.  Corner life comes in 4 minimal varieties.  See variation for them.]
(;W[ea];B[ba];W[da];B[ai]C[This is an overplay.  There's no reason to play this move, B13 and B12 work great for cutting white off from his corner.]
;W[bg]C[White punishes you for the overplay.];B[bh];W[ch];B[bf]
;W[dg];B[be]C[When you're cutting these stones you should consider what it is that you're cutting off.  There's no reason for you to link up to the dead group in the corner.  You got lucky that white made a mistake.  See variation. :)]
(;W[cf];B[ag];W[bi];B[dd];W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[ed]C[Nice! White didn't even see this coming. But you can't rely on your opponent to make mistakes. ;)]
;W[ah];B[fa];W[af];B[gi]C[Be careful of making a one space diagonal jump like that.  It's possible to cut cleanly through.]
(;W[ac];B[ec];W[fg]

(;B[jl];W[ik];B[gm];W[hn];B[gk];W[jm]C[At this point I guess you forfeited.  The game is still very close right now.  Black is a bit behind, but only about 15 points or so.  You could have easily turn this game around.

Final thoughts: You're both playing quite well for 24kyus.  I would recommend reading a book on openings and on attack and defense.  Locally, you play well, but what you do doesn't always makes sense for whole board play.  You also have a tendency to make rather rash invasions.  I would recommend playing some more against strong opponents to learn what does and doesn't work with that sort of invasion.

I'd also recommend reading up on Sensei's Library and Go Problems.  Go problems are pretty much invaluable for learning.

This is my first review.  So I'm a bit unpracticed at this sort of thing, so if you have any comments or critisisms I would love to hear them.

Regards,
Michael])
