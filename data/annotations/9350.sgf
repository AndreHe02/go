C[AB: Dear reviewer, this is a game I recently played at a tournament. I play Black. The game is rather typical for my style as I like to play hoshi and go for influence. In fact, White has all four corners, but for quite some time I felt the game was going well. In the end my mojo completely collapses and I was forced to resign. I would be grateful for hints, in particular regarding balancing territory and influence.

Hi,

I'm Dieter Verhofstadt (dv), former 2d and occasional reviewer.

Overall I think you did very well and would encourage you to continue playing this way. Before that fatal error at the end you were comfortably ahead. Your emphasis on influence is both imaginative and sound. You don't treat influence as a mere way to make central territory but use it for attack.

So, how to learn from this game?

I think that an influence oriented player must watch his overall connectivity as the board starts filling up. Your thickness comes not from eyes behind the lines but from connection. When your opponent manages to cut your lines, take a breath and throw away the least important stones, maintaining your overall connectivity and thickness. Keeping track of the score also helps in deciding which stones can be sacrificed.

You can jump right away to the end now, as that's where crux of this game lies, in my opinion. You can also browse through the game and read my occasional remarks.

BTW, I don't think from this game you are any weaker than me.

Enjoy!];B[dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pc];B[qf];W[qd];B[qi]LB[pe:B][nq:A]
C[dv: A 2-space extension on the side where White has invested is not really influence oriented. It's breaking up his sphere of influence and therefore a "negative" way of playing. I'd say this play is somewhat inconsistent.

Instead you could think of a more positive strategy like sanrensei, or approaching at A, or the higher B, which however lets white choose how to proceed.]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[dr];B[jd]C[dv: These moves are more influence oriented indeed]
;W[cf]
(;B[ci]C[Unusual. See var.

(not wrong, certainly playable at our level)];W[cc];B[cd];W[bd]
C[dv: This is a mistake by White.]
(;B[dc]C[dv: Although you are blocking on the wider side, the moves are inconsistent. See variations at 13 and 17]
;W[bc]LB[bb:A]C[dv: should be A]
(;B[df];W[cg];B[dg];W[cq];B[nq]LB[dl:B][pn:C][cp:A]C[AB: I thought answering at 'A' was not so interesting.

dv: The question is, which purpose do you see for your original star point? If next White at B, your stones are under attack. If you play at A now, the structure becomes stronger, putting some pressure on the white corner and making a stronger shape towards the side and centre.

If you want to tenuki and go for influence elsewhere, I'd play C]
;W[qn];B[kq]C[dv: Again a not so ambitious 2 space extension, breaking up White's side rather than building influence. Maybe deep down you are not always as influence oriented as you would like to be? :)]
;W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[hq];W[qk];B[od]C[AB: I remember being unsure here at this point. I didn't want to play to passively here.

dv: It's rather active indeed.];W[oc];B[md];W[hd]C[AB: I welcomed this invasion.

dv: Yes, White is overplaying here.];B[hf];W[jc];B[kc];W[ic]
;B[kb]SQ[kc][jd][hf]C[dv: good combination];W[hb];B[gc]C[AB: Seems obvious, this one.

dv: quite so :)];W[gb];B[fc];W[jb]
(;B[fb]LB[ie:A]C[AB: Probably I should enclose with 'A'.

dv: I have an interesting alternative. I've been looking at that corner aji.
See var. (I wouldn't think of this in a real live game)];W[ie]
;B[kf]C[dv: good technique];W[if]
(;B[ig]LB[hg:A]C[dv: tough decision. Let live for more influence.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[gf];B[hh];W[gg];B[ch]LB[ba:B][ge:A]C[AB: Too slow? I was a little afraid...

dv: No, this is precisely the moment to care about this move. I would have played on a number of occasions before too.

Also it gives strength to play A and keep White to 1 eye

AND

strange things happen at B too.];W[pe];B[rk]C[dv: Very good. I like your style]
;W[rj];B[qj];W[rl];B[pk];W[ql]
(;B[ri];W[gh]C[dv: Aah too bad he did not think that was sente. It's severe.

See var];B[gi];W[fi];B[gj];W[eh]C[dv: this hurts];B[dh]
(;W[jf]C[dv: I don't know why White forgets about that left side group.]
;B[kg];W[fe]C[dv: It seems like White fears the earlier mentioned eye stealing move.]
;B[re]C[dv: same for Black. I think the left side should not be cut]
;W[rd];B[fj]LB[ej:A]C[dv: Good area but it still lets White cut]

(;W[fo]LB[fp:A]C[AB: White has all four corners, is White clearly ahead at this point? I was still feeling ok... Maybe White should have played 'A' here?]
;B[er]

;W[cm];B[cn];W[bn];B[dm];W[cl];B[no]LB[ej:A]C[AB: I was actually confident at this point.

dv: there is now a very severe cut at A];W[nm];B[om];W[on];B[nn]

(;W[lm]C[AB: Seemed strange.

dv: Yes. See var];B[ol]LB[op:A]TR[om]C[AB: I was happy to extend here. Should I have played the atari at 'A'? It helps the cutting stone and is also big...]
;W[mj];B[jm]LB[mh:A][kj:B]C[AB: Is that good direction?

dv: That's too hard for me to answer. A is larger scale, blocking the escape routes. B tackles the shape.
Between these three, I'd pick A but I'm not sure];W[jl];B[il]
;W[im]C[dv: Usually a crosscut does something, but here it's overplay]
;B[jn];W[jk];B[lk]C[AB: Seemed risky, but I felt I need to play severly.

dv: YES! the vital point];W[nh];B[mk]C[dv: good];W[nk];B[lj]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[oj];B[nl]C[dv: Well, I think we can call it territory ...]
;W[of];B[ng]LB[sj:B][dk:C][op:A]C[dv: A relentless cut, maybe a bit too much. A, B and C come to mind

However, I cannot find a way for White to punish this.];W[oi]
;B[og];W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[pf]C[dv: White gets nothing];W[jg]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[mg];W[hl]C[AB: There is definitely some aji in my position now.

dv: indeed, see var]
(;B[ij];W[ik];B[hn];W[dl]LB[ej:A]C[dv: Both players have been disregarding A for a long time now]
;B[el];W[ek];B[fl];W[fk];B[gk];W[em];B[ej]C[dv: Only here the aji is removed]

C[dv: Well played. You do precisely what I advised in the beginning: throw away those stones that don't affect your overall thickness]
;W[io];B[ho];W[np];B[mp];W[op];B[bp];W[bq];B[mq]LB[mm:A]C[AB: I guess I should have captured at 'A'.]

(;B[ml]C[dv: This is the good choice!]
(;W[mo]TR[cf][cg][nn][no]C[AB: I missed that I cannot save the marked stones. In the end White even saved the K9 stones, so I had to resign. One other question that I was thinking about for a long time: Is there a sequence to capture or cut off the C14 group? That would have saved me a lot of thinking as well... Thank you very much for your comments!

dv: No, these stones cannot be cut, but as you've seen from my comments, a lot was going on in this area.]
