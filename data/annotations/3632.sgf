C[Hi- Here's a game for review; I'd love to hear comments on it. I played white, Vanguard22. I've been stuck at 15 kue for quite some time; this game knocked me down to 16 kue. While I think I made some obvious errors later in the game in life/death type situations, what puzzles me most is that I don't seem to be getting the extensions right in the beginning of the game, and I end up getting pincered and having weak groups.
thanks for the help.
John

Hi, 
I will try to answer your questions and put in some of my own comments.
I have made some comments for the black side also.

After reviewing the game, here are some general comments.

At the beginning you seem to have been envious of black's making territory and instead of making your own you tried prevent him.

You have started a few fights and stopped short while in other cases you have used threats which were easily defended. The latter ones should be kept as ko-threats.

Tenuki. There is no need to defend every single point. After each move, look around to see if you find bigger points on the board. This is very important at the beginning when the board has large empty regions.

I hope you find this helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions. You can contact me at gbohus@yahoo.com]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[dq];W[pp];B[cn];W[dj]C[Maybe just Q10 or R10 would be better  here?

Probably, but K3 or K4 are the natural extensions for black and so are much bigger for you, too.]
;B[cg];W[bj]C[Same deal here: K16 or K17 are best in this situation. Furthermore, playing on the second line at this stage of the game is not very useful. I assume you are trying to prevent a connection but even then C9 is better as the peek that comes next and is sente would not happen.]
;B[ck];W[cj]C[These three stones don't make territory and their influence is also small as black is on both sides.]

Certainly. Are you btw abandoning the lower right corner? For now black is not that strong there but one more move and you are in trouble.]
