PL[B];B[cd];W[pd];B[pp];W[dp];B[ec]C[This is standard, I don't know any better.

RickMott: you might say that it's a good idea
because with both sides occupying opposite
corners, the game will tend to be territorial
rather than moyo.  So an enclosure will be
better than an extension.  Since these players
are pretty much beginners at 22k, broad
comments on basic strategy issues will
probably be helpful even if it's obvious to
you.];W[qn];B[np]
(;W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[pq];W[rq]C[Both of you make a strong position.

RickMott: I always try to make some
comparison of the positions after an
exchange.  In this case, I think
white is a bit better off because
black becomes overconcentrated.];B[pn];W[ql];B[pm];W[qm]C[It is allways good to protect against a "peep" (Black 15 on Q7).]
;B[pj]C[RickMott: you might follow up your previous
comment by saying that since R8 is there,
black 17 jumps too far.  White can separate
Black here.];W[pl];B[ol];W[qf]C[RickMott: white 20 is not urgent.  Having
poked through black's developing wall, white
probably wants to cut at P9 (note the
continuity with the theme of previous
comments on peeps, cutting and connecting).
If White doesn't intend to cut and fight,
Q8 should not have been played and a big  extension on the left or bottom sides would be
preferable.];B[nd];W[oc];B[nc];W[qc];B[jd]C[RickMott: black comes out ahead here.  White's
corner is secure, but it took 4 moves and black
gets an ideal extension which helps create a
moyo on the upper side (note focus on broad
strategic concepts again).  If black gets to
the area around D10 star point first, his
moyo potential grows dramatically.];W[gq]C[RickMott: when commenting beginner games, getting
them to identify the right general area of the
board is helpful.  I would call this move
too small; either C10 or K3 would be more
important to prevent black extensions.];B[iq]
(;W[cm]C[With this move, white makes a so called "double wing" formation. But the edge is not secure. The 3-3 Point could still come to live.

I probably took the "big point" at C10.

RickMott: I agree.  Black should have taken this point or
D10 instead of J3, so white must take it now.];B[ci]C[Good aproach. Extends blacks territory and reduces whites.
Each move should have too targets.

RickMott: yes, good explanation.];W[ip]C[White keeps pressure on the black lone stone.

RickMott:  I think the point is less the single
stone than preventing black from developing
another large moyo.  If black is allowed to
jump to J5, the game becomes very difficult
for white.];B[jp];W[io];B[hq]
(;W[hp]C[The proverb says: avoid the empty Trianlge (marked with triangles).
The empty triangle is called so, becuase H5 is empty.
But in this situation, I realy do not see a better response.
Whites move still leaves a cutting point at "A".
Probably G5 is a good move too for white.

RickMott: White has to decide whether to protect his lower
left corner area or reduce black.  Eventually, the size of
the black top and upper left areas will decide the game.
White must aim to reduce this eventually.  Consider K5
instead, although that will allow black to reduce white's
corner.  I worry about solidifying black's bottom territory
too in the current sequence.]
(;B[jo];W[im];B[jm];W[km]C[I think this invasion is too early.  Black can simply make a "wall", so white can not connect this stone to the white stones on the left side.
Black can play on L6 as she did, or do what I did: make the wall even longer with K8.
(see variant play)

RickMott: I agree with k8 for black next.  Maybe White should
have just extended again at J8.]
(;B[kn];W[in];B[eq]C[RickMott: wrong part of the board.  Black should not fight
in white's corner, but expand the upper left moyo.  The
corner hit at D8, or jump to somewhere around F11.  Or
even just play K8 now to keep the black bottom moyo
growing.];W[ep];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[fr];W[fq];B[gr];W[cr]
;B[dn];W[cp];B[cn];W[dm];B[bo]C[I do not see, what was the intention of this move.  Even if black can reduce whites territory in the corner, black has no base (no eyes).
(see continuation: what happens, if white ignores this move.)

RickMott: both players have been too involved in the local fight
to see the big picture.  Black doesn't need to invade this corner
to win.  Playing reducing moves around its edges which enlarge
the black moyo is good enough.  Conversely, white should ignore
some loss in this corner to try and destroy the black moyos.]

the black upper left moyo.];W[em];B[fn]C[];W[fm];B[gm];W[gn]

I would not have cut at Q9.  I would try to capter L7 and have some influence to the center.

RickMott: The cut is playable, but possibly a simple extension
to O8 solves a lot of problems for black.  Black seems to me
to be ahead here, and should aim to simplify the game.];W[nl]
;B[om];W[ll];B[oj];W[nk];B[mj];W[nj];B[ni]C[This move leaves 2 cutting points for white.

RickMott: Black is attempting to capture white
on a large scale.  White, on the other hand,
cannot expect to live insde and must capture
some of the surrounding stones to win.  This
line is really too complicated for black.  If
black simply jumps out to P13 or P14 with 77,
aiming to connect the three stones out to
the top group, that's enough.  White will
have to struggle to live and black can
complete the upper moyo while attacking.];W[lj];B[mk]C[RickMott: This is not good.  Black should concentrate
on surrounding white.  M11 or even simple connection
at N11 would be better.];W[ml];B[li];W[lk];B[mi];W[jj]

(See variant, how black could escape.)

RickMott: No, this is Ok.  Black should focus on completing
the moyo and give up the stones.  White is forced to capture,
because now if black connects white is likely to die.  Your
variation doesn't keep white confined and white gets too
many liberties.  Then it's not clear which of the assorted
weak groups will die first.];W[ik]
(;B[fi]C[Black still has a strong move on K11 which white can not ignore.

RickMott: Yes, K11 is sente and should be played first.  Also,
this move could be one line lower at F10.];W[kg]C[RickMott: Black can still play K11 now.  White cannot
allow a ko for the life of the group, so must connect.

C[This loose connection just holds because of the marked stones, but whites two stones (A and B) get weak.

RickMott: My program (xgoban) doesn't show the marks, but I assume
you're talking about black's connection.  Black should still cut
at L12 with 97.];W[if]C[This is risky, because black can now try to cut of whites stones.

The results are good for both.

RickMott: It would be good to outline the tactical situation,
which is a race to capture.  Black must connect the interior
cutting stones out by capturing some of the surrounding white
stones.  White must try to prevent this.];W[ih]C[RickMott: Even this isn't enough to guarantee white
a connection.  Black can try K12, threatening double
atari at H12.  White should probably extend at E10
here.];B[ej];W[ch]C[RickMott: white makes a mistake here.  If white
wedges in at H11, black H10 atari, white F10
atari, black captures, white D10 atari and

into black's upper left territory.  This would
be bigger than the 4 stones white would have

protect the cutting points in the bottom group was the key
mistake.  Before that, black was leading for most of the
game.  White missed several chances to equalize things on
the right side or by reducing black's upper left moyo.

RickMott: yes!  Good suggestion.  Black should have
protected this cutting point.  I would run this
variation out a little further, though:

 1) If white is allowed to extend down at
    K2, black loses 6 stones.  So black
    must atari at K2.

 2) When white extends to L3, black cannot
    continue at L2 because white can play
    L5 and capture 2 stones.

 3) Black cannot make the empty triangle
    at L4, because white M4 atari followed
    by A results in capture.  So black
    must connect at L5.  The hanging
    connection at M5 doesn't work either
    because white will throw in at L5.

 4) White descends to L2, gaining a
    liberty and threatening to kill
    the bottom left group.  Black
    must respond at L1.  White can
    throw in at J1 and this will get
    very messy (translate: I'm too      tired to read this out, but it
