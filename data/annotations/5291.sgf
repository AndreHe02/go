;B[qd]C[ZD: I played black in this game.  I had initiative most of the game, but in the end I lost by a large amount.  Something of it was caused by several mistakes I made in endgame, but I believe I could have used my attacks more efficiently.  I will mark my notes/questions with ZD.

Thanks in advance for review.

---

The direction of attack was a problem, as you say.  I'll mention some things about it as I go through the game.]

C[ZD: I considered A instead, but since I cannot attack the white group easily, that move would look weird after white B.


I agree with the low move, limiting white's expansion.];W[qk]

(;B[rg]LB[qi:A][qm:B]TR[pg]C[ZD: I probably should not have played this move.  The variation might become useful later, and A and B would have more aji without this exchange.

The descent is usually wrong in this shape, since it leaves a cut behind.  See the variation.]
;W[ri];B[kc]LB[oc:A][pf:B][pl:C]C[ZD: I considered A instead, but it seemed slow to me.

Your move is too close to the white strength (F17).

B is the best shape, locally, but it's even slower than A.
(Compare with the previous variation.)

C, separating white's groups, may be best, although the cut next to B will it a difficult fight.]

Yes.  It's big, and sente.];W[cn];B[dr];W[gq]

C[ZD: Both A and B are weak, and white did not gain much from the ko, so I think I am leading at this point.  However, I did not get much from the attack (in fact, I lost a lot on the right side). I should have started with C, securing the right side in sente.

--

White's gain on the upper side was enormous.  Not only a large territory, but the upper right group went from weak to strong.

Black, of course, has made great gains on the lower and left sides.  It's hard to say how it will pan out.]
;B[jr];W[ir];B[hs];W[jq];B[kr];W[gs];B[es]LB[qk:C][pp:B][jq:A]
C[Which profit are you trying to get?  If you plan a splitting attack on the A, B and C groups, OK, but otherwise there's no profit to be had on the lower side.

Be satisfied with sente and attack on the left.   If white makes a second eye with E2, that's a one-point endgame move.]

(;B[ll]LB[mm:A][nm:B]C[ZD: A seemed too aggressive to me, but I get stronger shape out of it in the center, so perhaps it might have been a better choice.  Or maybe I should just have played B,allowing white to jump out, but continuing the attack (it seems to me that I could build up the center in the progress).

Where is the profit??];W[mn]
(;B[no];W[nn];B[on];W[nl];B[oo];W[om]LB[qm:A]TR[mq][nq]C[ZD: I made some territory on bottom and some influence in the center, and with possibility to connect at A, I destroyed some territory for white, but he managed to tenuki and strenghten his other weak group; I think this is about even, so far.

----

Your territory gain amounts to about 2 points (marked).  You can't count the part you already had.

You didn't destroy any territory for white -- white never had any.  The A stone already had the ability to run out.

It's about as "even" as a see-saw in a hurricane.];B[dm]LB[el:A]
C[ZD: This was a mistake. Something like A attacks the white group while closing off the center.]

C[ZD: Extending to A would be a bit better.];B[fl];W[ci];B[di]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[bh]LB[kc:A][hd:B]C[ZD: I was not very happy about this exchange; it seems difficult to make territory in the center, so I tried to do something about the A group.  Maybe I should have played around B with idea of either saving A on bigger scale, or closing off the center from this side.]

---

About the same, I think.  Black must take some loss from his weak group.

The play around here shows how big the ko threat at K16 was.  (Capturing the ko as you did was very large, too, of course.)]
