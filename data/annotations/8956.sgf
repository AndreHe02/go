C[Hello, I'm Cl√©ment, french, 24, and I'll comment your game.
The problem is, you didn't ask anything, and this is bad : first it means that you didn't look at the game after playing it, and then how can I know what you want to know, what you didn,t understand about the game. Next time, put questions in the sgf file, please.

My global feeling about the game is that you played too agressivly, especially black, and sometimes it paid, but mostly it wasn,'t good for you. Let's see.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[nq];W[qm];B[qo]C[This is kind of crazy : what did black expect here ? I'm not sure he can even live, and O3 will feel so weak then...]
;W[po];B[qp];W[qq]C[Good hane.];B[qn];W[pn];B[rq]
(;W[qr]C[Here white can double hane (see variation).];B[rr]
;W[rm];B[pq]C[I think white can sacrifice his two stones and get a nice shape here. Black lives in the corner, so closing his way out is big. (see variation)]
(;W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[rp]C[Not that much important, white can't cut here (black atari at S5), black must capture with O2.]
(;W[gq]C[White should try O2, saving his stones, and black's corner isn't alive (see variation).]
;B[nr];W[om];B[iq];W[jc]
(;B[ic]C[Arg ! Never play contact moves like this in the opening. White will get solid and black's move isn,t effective.
Remember : attack is from far away, and contact moves are defemsives moves.

Black should play G17 or H17 (see variation).];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb]
C[It's submissive to play on the second line, prefer K16 here.]
;B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[lc]C[After all the sequence, white's stones are strong, because of J17.]
;B[nc];W[ld];B[ie];W[pj];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ok];B[qj]
(;W[qk]C[White could try R11 too (see variation).];B[ql];W[rk]
;B[pi];W[oj];B[rj];W[rl];B[qh];W[oi];B[oh]C[Not so goog exchange, black gets a nice shape, P11 is useless.]
;W[dj];B[cj]C[Again ! Black, you should forget these plays in the opening, I think this is the reason why you lost that game.]
;W[dk]C[There is proverb in go saying : when facing a contact move, play a hane. Here white should play C9.]
;B[ck];W[dm]C[It's a bit too late now, but white should hane with C8 to try to block black.]
;B[dl]C[B8 is enough, white must connect and black is alive with B7 for instance.]
;W[cl];B[el];W[bl];B[di]C[Bad shape for white.];W[ej];B[ei]
;W[fj];B[fi]C[Here black must connect with C11 or C12, or white must cut (see variation).]
(;W[fl];B[em];W[dn];B[fm];W[gl];B[gm];W[hl];B[hm];W[im]C[Hane here is hard because of the possible cut.]
;B[il];W[jl]C[This atari just says : ok black, seal me in and kill me ^^. (White can try J9, but the mistake was J7, or not to cut earlier)]
;B[gj];W[fk];B[ik]C[White is captured.];W[hj];B[hk];W[lj];B[ij]
;W[jk];B[hi]C[Small moves from both sides.];W[in];B[go]C[White ie trying to make a moyo, the black stones are not weak here, because white's big snake is captured.]
;W[lo];B[gp];W[fp]C[F3 is stronger.];B[fo];W[ep];B[eo];W[do]
;B[hq];W[gr]C[Black, you just give white the corner points, giving you nothing.]
;B[jj];W[jp];B[io];W[jo];B[ip];W[jq];B[hn];W[kj];B[jn]C[Your stone won't go anywhere, this is unreasonnable.]
;W[jm];B[kn]C[I think white can even ignore this (play K2 for instance).]
;W[kl];B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[no];B[ko];W[kp];B[lp];W[lq];B[mp]
;W[mq];B[np];W[mr]C[See ? trying to save K6 made you lose a big group (amd the corner isn't alive yet).]
;B[jr];W[kq];B[nn];W[oo];B[os];W[op];B[hr];W[mf];B[qs];W[ns]
;B[rn];W[kh];B[kf];W[gc];B[gd]
(;W[fc]C[Againm white can try the double hane with F16 (then H16 is double atari).]
;B[fd];W[cf]C[Hard to see how this could live ...];B[ec];W[cd]
;B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[de];B[ee]C[Not good, white will get a nice shape with E14, black can try B13 or even B15.]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[df]
(;B[dh]C[Black must not protect the atari it doesn't give an eye (see variation).]
;W[be];B[bg];W[bf]
(;B[ag]C[This is gote, black must connect, and then destroy white'eye (see variation).]
;W[af];B[bi];W[ad];B[ac]C[White lives in sente, crazy :-) .]

(;B[qf]C[Black must play double hane (see variation).];W[rf]
;B[rg];W[sd];B[rc]C[Too early, you must recude the space before attacking one vital point. White can play Q18 and live big here.]

;W[eq];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[cs];B[bs];W[er];B[bp];W[aq]C[Mistake (same as black's in the upper right corner) : to kill a group, the first thin to do is to reduce the space where to create eyes. Here Black plays B5 and lives.]
(;B[ap];W[ar];B[bq]C[This is useless, white can't play here, it's self atari.]
;W[bo];B[an];W[ao];B[bn];W[co]C[And it took one of you liberties, here blakc could have played E6 with one more liberty.]
