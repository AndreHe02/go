C[In this game I played black. I won the game with a sneaky capture at the end. I would
appreciate comments on the whole game, of course, but my main interest is how white
obtained such a large corner in the bottom-left and what I should have done to prevent
it.

vlkplk*   Hello! I'll try to answer Your question and as well add some comments on places
which seems interesting for me. Sometimes I'll add some variations just to show some
other possibility, without comment. Please, understand, that in many cases I don't
know the good moves, so my comments should be token with reserve. Sometimes the moves which I suggest doesn't mean that I criticize your play. In some position there may be many good moves, choice of one could be simply a matter of taste of the player.

Enjoy, Karel.];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp]
(;B[kc]C[vlkplk*   Maybe there is nothing wrong with this black move. But sure You have heard about famous Chinese opening? (B J16 or B J17) This actual stone (L17) may be too far to cooperate with C16.]
;W[cn];B[qk];W[qm]C[vlkplk*   Now white has somehow sketched very big moyo on lower side. To play at K4 or around nevertheless maybe not so good for black (see var.) But for black next move I would prefer something like O9. The reason is that now two moyos are
in competition and since white's position has h oles, black can afford same for the time
being.]
(;B[qh]C[vlkplk*   I think this move is too much submiting to white. There is
no vision of 3dimensional moyo and black's corner is still possible to invade at 3-3 and thus reduce the territory greatly. This move has one advantage - it's a solid play and
makes possible white move at O7 or the like goteh.];W[ed];B[df]
;W[hd]C[vlkplk*  
Here you see ( one of reason), why the 'Chinese opening' ideal. If the black stone
at L17 was placed properly at J16 or J17, whites live wouldn't be so easy... And black
would build up for example a wall too lines further and makes his prospects better.]

(;B[hb];W[cc]C[vlkplk*   Standard move from white, I think.]

(;B[bc]C[I think that the
variation would have been safer. In the game, white was too kind.

vlkplk*   I think it was ok from black.]
(;W[dd]C[vlkplk*   I think better from white would be simply draw back.]
;B[bd];W[de]C[vlkplk*   black is not unhappy when white helps him to solidify his
group.];B[cf];W[ef];B[cj]C[vlkplk*   Big point. Seems that this distance is safe.]

(;W[nc]
(;B[oc];W[ob]C[Hmmm, I probably should not have attached

vlkplk*   Lets see whether there are some better moves. It seems that contact move You hav e made was ok. Territory is also important. But I would like to switch the direction as in variation after.]

(;B[pb];W[od];B[pc];W[nd]
(;B[jq]C[vlkplk*   I think this move in center of lower side
may be questionable. White will attack from one side or other and will get profit on
both sides. Definitely, black had to continue on upper side and take advantage of
attacking O17 group. The problem is

1) two black stones on upper side
2)the weakness at R14.];W[hq]
(;B[mq]
(;W[hp]C[vlkplk*   I would prefer something like in variation.
This move was too kind for black.];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[je]C[vlkplk*   Maybe, first as in
var.];W[qf]
(;B[qe]C[vlkplk*   I think this was mistake, since it allows white to
connect easily and doesn't connect black. Black group in corner is safe, since it has
O18 left.];W[pf];B[oh];W[re];B[rd];W[pe];B[qd];W[rg]C[vlkplk*   black has been divided effectively into three groups here. Big loss even in terms of territory. Not very good I think.]
;B[rh];W[ng]C[Now, the upper right corner is a little open but I have
two ways to defend it: O18 or S18. So I decided to play it only when it became more
urgent.];B[og];W[of];B[lf];W[nh];B[oj];W[se]
(;B[sd]C[vlkplk*   Better variation
instead of this...];W[nb]C[OK, now defending the corner is urgent]
;B[rb];W[gb];B[ic];W[hc]
(;B[ib]C[vlkplk*   Black could omit this move and take some bigger point!]
;W[cb];B[qr]C[Is this too small? I think it is. I think the marked points are all
reasonable options.

vlkplk*   I think this was not small move. It makes black group safe and at same time it reduces whites corner. It was urgent move.]

(;B[fp]C[I was not convinced that this was the best or safest way to proceed but I knew that I had to reduce this corner somehow.

vlkplk*   Sure, white is too strong there, so you cannot go so deep. Lets see some variations, but I'm not sure what would be the best...]

vlkplk*   It seems that white gained as much as was possible in the corner and as well he gets some strong wall towards the center and later maybe some points there as well. The two last moves of this sequence should have been played at first and result would be better for black, I think.]
;W[jn];B[do];W[co];B[ej];W[ml]C[vlkplk*   white is obviously going to make territory in center as well. there is no need to response directly to white N8.]

bottom right group has a weakness at R5. I figured that I might be able to use the marked
group as bait. Of course, it might be possible to keep the marked group and then play at
R5, but that is dubious and capturing the white group is much better than keeping the
marked group. So...];B[ho];W[fq];B[op];W[gl]C[vlkplk*   But its clear.
White didn't calculate well and lost 12 points in this exchange.
Whites move-simply mistake.]
(;B[qo];W[qp];B[rn];W[il]C[vlkplk*   so this was minus 12 points for white.]
;C[As a result of the last capture, I managed to get a safe win.

vlkplk*   I see. To win makes sure one happy, but in this game it was by big mistake by
white. Usualy You can't count on opponents mistakes. There was an interesting article
about this subject, but I forget the source. There are two opinions. One is that player
must not count on opponent s weaknesses (if he knows some) since it is not fair and not
in the spirit of Go. The contra opinion is, that Go is a game, actually , and it is
played by people, not a gods or computer. So even some human tactitcs is allowed! As for
me, I prefer slightly the first opinion, but in real life it goes according the second
one, anyway...])
