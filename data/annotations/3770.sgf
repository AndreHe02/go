C[krv: I'm playing black here. Dear reviewer, thank you for your time and attention. I'm believe that your comments help me to improve my play.

lop: Hi, I will try to help you find and correct your mistakes. But please keep in mind that I'm just a few stones stronger than you and so there will be mistakes in my review too. If you think critically about what I say and try to find where I'm wrong you will get even more out of this review.
Your main mistakes in this game were that you let yourself become closed in in the top right corner and that you tried to kill the big white group on the left side. When, after losing many points, you failed to kill it, the game was effectively over.
The goal of an attack is to make free profit and not to kill, when you understand this you will play at least 2 or 3 stones stronger.]

C[krv: It's slightly hard to me to decide where are key points between black and white territory on the left and right sides.
I've considered also C10 on the left and several points on the right side.

lop: I think here all the points you marked are more or less of the same value. I think we amateurs can play them all without making a big mistake. Of course it makes a big difference for the continuation of the game where exactly you play now because you have to make that move work together efficiently with the whole board situation.
Wether you play the low C10 or high D10 is a decision based on your personal preferences. I don't think anybody can say D10 is really a bad move.
Other moves you can think about are the high approach move of  f (Q5), sanrensei with g (K16).  Maybe you can even split the bottom side with something like h (K3).
Personally I don't like the low approach move of i (R4) because white can press black into a low position and the influence is maybe exactly what white wants here.]

C[krv: Is C5 better? Are better moves in other areas?

lop: It's hard to say wether C5 or the move you played is better.  I don't play C5 usually.
Anyway I wouldn't play C4 either because i think something else is more important now.
A pincer on the right side (d or maybe g) seems to be playable to prevent a large white formation on the right. e is unusual but interesting. c seems playable but if I play on the top I'd prefer  a normal extension from Q16 like h (O17).
I don't like f because white will have a nice target to attack with a pincer. If you want to play an approach move on the bottom right i recommend the high move at i (Q5)]

(;B[gq]C[lop: black bumps into the white wall. I wouldn't like to extend into whites strong stones like this. 
Here white doesn't really have 2 eyes yet so maybe it is not really bad to play this way but still i feel awkward because white can still easily make it to the center. 
White can play g5 or so to become stronger and black will have troubles with his group]

(;W[qj]C[lop: I think this is a mistake white should play g5]

Can I capture C9 now?
lop: I don't think black can actually kill the white C9 group. You can attack it to get something in the center or to threaten the group on the top, but when you start trying to kill it you start losing points]
