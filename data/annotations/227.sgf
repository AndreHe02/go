;W[nq]C[No reason to play low here, I think. O4  would be better.];B[cn]
L[rp][qq]C[Good move. You often want to invade the  corner in a "double-wing", but in this case the approach works well with the  Black thickness above.
Black could first exchange A (S4) for B (R3), after White's low extension to  O3.]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp]
(;B[fn]M[cf][dj]C[This move gives White a chance to strengthen the marked weak  stones and leave Black without a base.
The normal move would be D8. It's not much of a base, but it puts heavy  pressure on the marked white stones, and Black will get to extend later.
(See variations.)];W[bl]C[This is too low, should be C8.  Now Black can attach at C8.]
;B[hn]C[Consistent anyway. Good because  it looks down into White's domains along the lower side and extends towards  friendly stones in the center.]
;W[qf]C[When Black has the  "double-wing" formation (and the center stone on top of this), invading the  corner is a must.  Starting with an approach is possible but somewhat risky  in this case. The black stones on the right side are not as weak as the white  on the left side.]
;B[qh]L[qe][pf][nd]C[This would drive White into the corner.  The sequence A-C (see previous comments about the lower left side) may be  better.]
;W[of]C[Where should White run? White must  take the corner.];B[nd];W[rd]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[mf]C[Black should play S18 or R18, and keep White on  the run. If White 39, Black M16. White is still not alive and gets absolutely  no territory, while Black can get territory on both sides of the weak White  snake.]
;W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[ra]
(;B[df]L[ch][di][cq]C[This helps White, and makes Black  overconcentrated. Several other options leaps to mind. On the left side, A or  B is perhaps better. And since White left the lower side open around H4, the  lower left corner is very vulnerable. Invading at C is a possibility. The  continuation depends on White's response. (See variation.)]

;B[pg]L[rp][qq][on]C[I don't understand this move. It doesn't  create much territory, and it doesn't attack White. A more interesting  direction would be the A-C sequence.]
;W[pf];B[og];W[lf];B[nf];W[jf];B[fh]C[How  about chasing the white eyeless, baseless, stones with J15? Every stone will  be a burden for White, while Black secures territory.]

;W[ke];B[kd];W[ji];B[kj]C[Maybe the other direction instead (J10)? I'm not sure...]
;W[ki];B[ng]C[Overly cautious. The black stones on the right side can take  care of themselves. (Actually, if White cuts at O13, it helps Black  strengthening his right side group.)]
;W[lj]C[Maybe the wrong side?  J10 looks more threatening to Black.];B[mj]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[on];B[fi]C[This move is important, but the  timing is not the best. (Should have been played earlier, perhaps instead of  N10.)]

[ld][lm][ma][mb][mc][me][mm][na][nb][nc][oc][oh][on]C[Black got a good start in this game, but seems to have a problem  finding the right direction of play. White tends to leave a lot of weaknesses  behind, which Black rarely took advantage of. White's big loss was the left  side group. Ensuring life for this group early would have been worth a lot  compared to the 8 point lump in the center. Black's big loss was of course  the overplay at the lower side. Instead of simply red

ucing White's territory to a few points, White got almost 30 points there!
Both players need to refine their tactical reading.  Answering non-threats  and playing on already dead groups is costly.]

(;B[lq]N[Variation];W[lp]L[kq][ro]C[This is a common reply to Black's invasion, but as both ladders work for  Black, it's probably a bad move by White. White's best move is probably just  exchanging A for Black M4 (or N3), and then White B.]
