R: Hi! I'm Roland, and I'm around KGS 4k. All my comments are marked with R:.

R: In this review I'll concentrate mostly on attacking and defending weak groups in the opening and middle game, since that seems to be the areas where you have most problems. I have mostly ignored the endgame.]

White on the other hand has around 8 points of territory in the corner, a few points on the bottom side, and access to the center. Additionally, the left side black group is still weak.]

thanks for the review

R: The 4 stones were a mistake by the computer, but it made a lot bigger mistakes earlier. It had a huge lead in the middle game.
I think your biggest problem was underestimating the value of attacking weak groups. Weak groups are almost always more important than territory.

R: In this game, the big problem was the bottom black group. It had a big impact on the whole board:
First it allowed white to live very comfortably on the bottom side. While attacking the bottom black group, white could build strength and weaken the left side black group. This in turn reduced the black side at the top, and made the white groups in the top and right stronger.]

Note also that as a side effect the top black group gets weakened, which in turn makes the top white group stronger. That kind of chain reaction with weak groups can very quickly lose you the game.]

(;B[em]C[R: This is the more important side. I would seriously consider sacrificing the E3 group.
They are just a few weak stones. They don't threaten anything, they don't separate anything and they don't make any territory.]

(;B[gq];W[hn];B[io];W[kn];B[in];W[hm];B[jm]C[R: Bad. Black is running away, the stones on the left side become weak, and white has an opportunity to connect to the R8 stones.]

(;B[hm];W[gn];B[hn];W[ho];B[io];W[hp];B[gl]C[R: If white really wants to capture the black stones, something like this might happen, and black at least has a strong outside position.
