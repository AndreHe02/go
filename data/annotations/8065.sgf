J: Hi my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments begin with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[dp]C[J: Black plays cross fuseki to start a fight.]
;W[pq];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm]C[RA: don't know if was the best aproach

J: Everything looks ok so far.];W[qi]C[J: White's play here is strange.  Black can punish white with P3 immediately.  See variation.]
(;B[qj]C[J: Black should not contact here. It'll only make the lonely white stone stronger.]
;W[rj]C[J: white wants to live small...  When it's this early in the game, black should be happy.]
;B[pi];W[qk];B[pj];W[qh];B[ri];W[rh];B[rk];W[si];B[ql]C[RA: too small or its ok?

J: Too small.  The variation that black chose causes black to become overconcentrated; but it's hard to find a better outcome after the contact play.]
;W[nq]C[J: White is very happy to fix his mistake.];B[qf]C[J: R14 applies some amount of pressure on white's group, but black can't be sure if he cares more about the corner or outside influence with say P13.  Black should omit playing in this area for now to see how the rest of the board develops.]
;W[ph];B[oh];W[pf];B[pe];W[og];B[nh];W[ng];B[mh];W[oe];B[nd]
C[J: O17 is the correct shape here for black.];W[fq];B[hq]C[J: This lower pincer feels weird when white has such a strong group in the lower right side.  The bottom is uninteresting for it is hard to develop meaningful territory.]
;W[fo];B[mp]C[J: An interesting direction to play from;  but it feels that black's center moyo is nullified with F5 influence. Also, be wary of white surrounding the lower left corner.]
;W[np];B[no];W[mq];B[lp]CR[nr][ns][nn][mm][mn][mo]C[J: Black looks like he is expanding his center territory;  but if we step back and look at it from a pure points perspective, black has only gained about four points; and white has gained two.  No reason to lose sente for this.

When trying to use center influence, it's very hard to make territory.  Many times, it's better to try to force a weak white group inside to kill it.]
(;W[hp]C[J: White's development here is too slow. White has the severe play of D6.  See variation.]
;B[ip];W[ho];B[cm];W[io];B[jp];W[mg]
(;B[de]C[J: White's group at the bottom left is not alive yet.  See variation.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[lh];B[li];W[ki];B[kh];W[lg];B[lj]
;W[kj];B[kk];W[jh];B[id]C[J: Black's high move here seems too distant from his other stones when there are so man white stones around.  White doesn't need to worry about the ladder here when black's upper corner is weak.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[ke];B[kd];W[od]C[J: The O16 mistake rears it's ugly head.]

[ss]C[rarellano [5k\]: thx

rarellano [5k\]: good game

stajima [4k\]: yhx

White wins by 3.5 points.

J: Thanks for showing me this game.  I think there are several take-aways from this game:

Try not to contact weak stones, you'll only make them stronger;  almost always attack from a distance.

Secondly, realize that sometimes it's useless to attack a group.  Just take the big point.]
