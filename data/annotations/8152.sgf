Time: 60 min absolute

Even though I won this game, I think that there was overplay from my part, but I'm not sure.

In the end, I played too hastly and could have lost the game because of that.

My opponent lost so clearly becouse he failed in tsumego.

I have made few comments of my own. I hope that you could make some comments on those and also if I have missed something, then pointing that out.

Thank you for your time.

(;B[ip]C[mr0661: This move was a little odd...];W[qo]C[mr0661: ...because of this.  Even after this move, I thought that there is still enough room to easily invade, or take sente.

Harleqin:  So what?  All loose formations are invadable, the question is whether that is profitable.

Please see the variation to the last move (move 5).]
(;B[oo]C[Harleqin:  This is bad shape, because Black cannot answer R3 at R2 now.  Black should play O4, P4, or some kind of pincer.]
(;W[pm];B[fq];W[dn];B[qk];W[qq]C[mr0661: I was really happy to get this move]
;B[pp];W[qp];B[qh]
(;W[lp]C[mr0661: Is this invasion good?

Harleqin:  I think that it is playable.  However, it is not urgent.  While the black stones on the right look attackable, the black stones on the left are quite stable.  Therefore, there are just a weak white and a weak black group in this area.  Black thus does not have too big problems here.

I would perhaps approach the upper right corner first.];B[om]
C[Harleqin:  Good move; Black strengthens himself.]
(;W[pn]C[Harleqin:  White should play Q8 directly.]

(;B[jp]C[Harleqin:  Peeping with a nobi is usually a bad idea, unless there is a specific tactical reason.  Black should still connect at O7.]

(;B[lr]C[Harleqin:  Now it gets ridiculous.  Just connect O7.]
;W[il];B[gm];W[dr]C[mr0661: I thought that taking base from black's group looks nice]
;B[pr]C[Harleqin:  Another wasted move.  Black used two moves (M2 and Q2) to make about 10 points.  That is late endgame!]
;W[qr];B[er];W[cq]C[mr0661: Maybe this was too much of following black moves?]
;B[ir]
(;W[el]C[Harleqin:  If you want to help the centre group, play in the centre.  If you want to make points on the left side, play on the left side.  This move dangles in between, and is in danger of doing neither.]
;B[ci]
(;W[gl]C[mr0661: I wanted to solidify my centre group.  Is this too slow?  I also thought that I could kill the whole group if I were given sente.

Harleqin:  Killing is difficult.  This connection does look nice, but E8 still looks like dame.  White should perhaps check the black stone on the left.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[cl]
(;W[dm]C[mr0661: Maybe I shouldn't have defended here at all?

Harleqin:  Since all you do is connect rather strong groups, this really looks like dame.]

(;W[ch]C[mr0661: Is this invasion good? or should I prepare this move more first, or is there better one?

(;B[ne]C[mr0661: Would invasion at 3x3 be better now?

Harleqin:  This black move does not look good.  White is quite strong in the centre, so there is no real moyo envisionable.  I think that Black should block the corner first (see variation).]
(;W[ld]C[mr0661: This move felt a little slack, but I am not sure what would be better.

Harleqin:  I think that simply invading the corner is enough.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[oe];W[pg]C[mr00661:  Is this too deep?

Harleqin:  It is certainly difficult if Black unwraps his axe.]

Harleqin:  I do not think so.  The black group at O4 is quite stable, because it can get S2.  J4 can now be stabilized by playing F3.  Afterwards, an invading white stone would be weak between strong black groups, so invading is not so interesting.]

(;B[fq];W[dn];B[ip]C[Harleqin:  This is a variant on the Kobayashi fuseki.  It is now usually seen as a mistake to approach the lower right corner tightly, since Black can pincer and J4 helps in fighting.  Invading the lower side is now not what White should think about as high priority, because the other three sides are much more open.  White would now usually play a far approach on the lower right corner.

Omitting F3 is an unusual choice, but certainly playable.]))
