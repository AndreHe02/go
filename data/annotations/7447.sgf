C[This is a game played with what I call the "stickies".... players who like to stick to your stones and are less concerned with securing a base, settling groups, creating moyo, etc.

Theoretically, I should be winning games against the "stickies", but as you can see in this game, I have a tendency to fall apart...

the question is, how do I punish deep invasions? or really small moves?

--

Dear Joseph,

My name is Joss, and I'm "tealeaf" on KGS.

As a first answer to your question: the first step to "punishing" deep invasions and really small moves is to accept that they will often, in fact usually, live. A classic mistake is to try and kill a deep invasion. If it's a reasonable invasion, even when it's deep, the correct way to play is to let it live, but make it live small. In return, you will get influence for the rest of the board. If the deep invasion takes away all your territory, and there's nothing left on the board for you to get in return, your territory wasn't solid enough and so you were too spread out!

The thing to really accept, however, is that invasions often live. When you accept that, you start to learn how to "handle" them.

Let's get on with the game. :)];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qn]
C[There's nothing wrong with this move, but I personally prefer to close off the corner at R15. That gives you a secure corner, and as it's high and facing your stone at C16 all your stones are working nicely together.

As I said, though, I don't think that there's anything wrong with your move.]
;W[pd]C[Ouch! Attacking directly with a contact like this isn't a good idea for white. In fact, attacking by touching a stone is typically a bad idea as it automatically removes one liberty from the attacking stone. Black's response should be calm and strong.]
;B[qd]C[In my opinion, responding like this just presents a cross-cut to the attacker. This gives a chance to confuse things. I would prefer a direct, solid extension at R17.]
;W[pe]C[White doesn't go for the cross-cut, but instead strengthens his stone.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[qg];W[oc]C[This is made possible because of the cut at R17. That's why I prefer to respond at the start by making my stones strong. (I'm a very passive player, though, and should be more aggressive!)]
;B[pb];W[nd]C[At this point, white has split up your top side by building a wall between it. This is why I would have preferred to enclose the corner by playing R15 rather than R6.]
;B[jc]C[This is good. Squash white in and make him live, whilst extending away from your existing corner.]
;W[lc]C[White makes a base, but looks a bit cramped.];B[je]
C[Good. Keep up the pressure.];W[le];B[nq]C[A reasonable time to choose somewhere else. I would still have been tempted by Q13, though. This keeps up the pressure on white and would work well with your R6 stone.

If you are going to play elsewhere, I would be tempted to approach the D4 stone at C6. This works with your C16 stone, and starts to make a lovely big corner framework. Those stones all working together would be very powerful.]
;W[oq];B[np];W[nr];B[op]C[I would be tempted by N2, which then would lead on to an approach at F3/F4 to grab the bottom edge, but this is a reasonble way to exploit his weak  corner stones.]
;W[pr];B[po];W[qp]C[This is all okay. 

This move is, however, a little bit too early, in my mind. It forces white to defend and strengthen his weak corner stones, so it might be best to leave the situation unresolved for the moment and maybe exploit it later. Without this move, R3 is a nice peep or ko threat.]
;B[oh]C[Pressure on the white stones and expanding your territory. I like it, but I think I prefer Q13 because of the strength of it. 

This move leaves room for a push at R14 followed by breaking through at R12.]
;W[pj]C[Can this stone be punished?

--

It's a large area, and especially with the weakness at Q13 you really have to "punish" this stone by making it live small. If you mean "can it be killed?", the answer is no.

I would first be tempted to follow up on your threat against the white group at Q16. A play around O14 would hurt, and would build up your wall on the right side. After that, playing on top of the white stone forces it to live in a small area while you gain strong influence towards the centre.

As it is, you tried to "undercut" this stone to hold on to "your" territory on the side. I think that this is the fundamental mistake. It's not "your" territory yet, because it was big enough to invade!

Even if white gets the middle side territory, you have the top right corner. You should make sure that your stones around O4 are used, so extending along the bottom would be good.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[qj];W[pi]C[This is exploiting the weakness at Q13 again.

So far, you've taken away his base, but he's got room to run away to the centre. By doing this, you've gained a little bit of territory on the side, but lost a huge amount of potential influence in the centre. Also, because he's exploited your weakness and made you defend, he has really devastated your territory.

The "trick", then, would be to play a leaning attack over the white stone. Responding with P9 to the Q10 stone would make him live underneath you and gain you all the influence. It would also, at the same time, put pressure on the white group at the top.]
;B[ph];W[pl];B[ql];W[on];B[pm];W[om];B[jq]C[You threatened the cut at P8 but didn't follow through. It looks okay to me. I haven't played it out, but I think that it would definitely be bad for white.

This move is fine in itself, though. I would be tempted to approach at F3 and then pull back to here instead, though.]
;W[pn]C[You asked for this a bit, by effectively creating a peep against yourself. It's a bit of a waste for white to play it now, though.]
;B[qm];W[qo];B[oo]C[This should have been ignored. It would only have lost you a point. There are far bigger moves on the board! C6 or C10 would probably be my choice, or C3.. P8 is still there for you.

Of course, in retrospect, N2 would have been good as well!]
;W[mq];B[mp]C[I would be tempted to abandon these stones by playing M4. If white chooses to capture them, you can build up influence before approaching at F3 and taking the bottom. By trying to save these four stones, you've given white a lot more points than you would if he'd just captured them.]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[kp];B[ln];W[kq]C[Here I was thinking push else white gets large moyo on the lower left... see variation.]

(;B[ko];W[jp];B[jo];W[ip]C[You saved the stones, but white has gained the whole bottom edge.

At this point, P8 still looks pretty good to me!]
(;B[kg]C[Pressure on the white stones, but the whole left side is open. A move there would be much more valuable.]
;W[lg];B[lh]C[Again, you're presenting a crosscut which leads to later problems. I would much prefer L12 rather than M12. This prevents you having to come back and defend later.

You can push over again with M11 afterwards if you like, but those two stones together make your whole position much stronger.]

;B[ll]C[P8!];W[lj]C[P8! :)

Actually, this whole struggle was a bit untimely. With the whole of the left side open, and the potential for a huge moyo around your top-left corner, a move on the left side would be so much more valuable.]
;B[mk];W[lk];B[lm];W[nl];B[nj]C[I won't keep pointing out how valuable the left side is. :)]

;B[jl];W[il];B[jm];W[im];B[jn];W[io];B[mn];W[nh]C[This is all an example of a stronger close-fighter pushing you around. Rather than trying to save each stone, think about sacrificing one or two to get your stones out into the open. White has erased your territory, then built a wall on top of you.]
;B[ei]C[The right sort of idea -- making a framework for your stones.

It's a lot smaller now, though, than if you'd played on the left side earlier. On top of that, white now has a hugely strong wall covering the bottom-left corner of the board.]
;W[de]C[Perfectly reasonable.];B[dd]C[I would go for the other side to defend. The reason is that white has to then make life inside your wall of stones. I imagine you chose this side because you didn't want white to life and erase your big black corner, but as it is he will now reduce your potential territory on the side and get it himself.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[dh];B[cf];W[df]C[Wrong side. White should have pushed up at C13, sacrificed the two stones and moved along the side towards the D4 stone.]
;B[cg];W[dg];B[bg];W[ch];B[cj];W[bh];B[af];W[dj]C[Okay, white made a big mistake there! Now he has to scrabble for eyes.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[ck];W[dk];B[dl];W[ek];B[co]C[Keep the pressure up! Your opponent has made an empty triangle! ALWAYS exploit empty triangles. :)

A play at E8, to white white would probably respond, would be a good "set up" move for this approach.]
;W[cm]C[That's what you get for leaving a cutting point. :(]
;B[cl];W[dm];B[em]C[Why not E8? That would achieve the same thing, but more strongly, and threaten white's empty triangle.]

Okay, my final comments.

(I apologise for not putting variations into the game. I prefer to explain principles rather than go over too many variations.)

My overall advice is this: learn to give up your perceived advantages. 

A lot of problems here are caused by a classic problem of being too attached to "territory" and stones. The problems on the right side came by trying to keep as much of your territory as possible when it was attacked. As a result, you lived small under your opponent and pushed him out into the centre. Instead, you should have pushed him down into your territory, made him live inside the territory, and gained advantage that way.

Similarly, when fighting you seem to try and save each stone. You also try to kill every one of your opponents' stones! I can't see the timing, but I am guessing that a lot of the fights on the right hand side and on the left hand side were quite fast. You moves are quite reactive and only concerned with saving a group or killing a group.

Try to sit back and think what you want to get out of each move. This means taking a global view of the board. For so much of the game you were playing moves that saved one or two stones when the whole left side was open for you.

My study advice comes in two, slightly contradictory, parts:

1) Most importantly, try to keep a view of the whole game. I would say that your major problem was getting caught up in fights, and being too concerned with the life or death of small groups. This is reflected in the effort that you spent on trying to hold on to territory when your opponent invaded. The next "big" idea for you is to let your opponent get a little bit of what he wants in exchange for you getting a lot of something else! To this end, if you have a copy of "Attack and Defense" then it would be a good thing to read.

Even in the variations that you've included, you've focused on presenting the moves that you could have played that would have killed his stones. Instead, try to think of the moves that would have gained you points on the board. Don't be too obsessed with the fight -- that's not the purpose of the game.

2) Given that you were taking on your opponent in lots of fights, he did get the better of you most of the time. Life and death problems would probably help you out, there. I get the impression that your opponent has got to where he is by being a relatively strong fighter without too many overall strategic concerns. 

You're playing a bit more strategically, but when your opponent punches you hard, it all crumbles. This is actually a little bit typical of the "Western" KGS-style play -- there's a lot of book learning and knowing what "should" work. When we run up against a player who doesn't know that and just ignores the "rules" that we've learnt, we tend to find out that we don't know how to punish them.

So my advice there would be to read up on life and death,  or alternatively to play a few games on CyberOro to toughen up your tactical skills.

To boil it all down:

Go is about compromise -- you have to let your opponent get something, just make sure you get something in return.

Don't be too concerned about protecting "large" territory, or small groups of stones.

Keep your eye on the whole board every move.

I hope this helps! If you have any questions, feel free to email me or to catch me on KGS. (I'm not online much at the moment due to work committents, but you can leave me a message if you like.)
