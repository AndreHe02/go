drmaciver 27k : Hi

Hi!  Okay, since you will get a better feel for the game and your moves as you play more and see what happens, I'm not going to address a lot of individual moves.  I'm going to focus on something more general that you will be able to apply in many situations: speed and opening theory.  Throughout the game, I think I give you enough stuff to try to remember for a while and work on.  Here are some quick things you should consider.]

(;B[qd]C[Your first move is good.  It goes for the corner right off.  Think about it: when you try to surround territory, the corners are the best possible places to do so.  Two sides are already surrounded that you don't need to waste stones on.  Stake out as many as possible as quickly as possible.  Let me show what you should have done in this game.]
;W[hh]
(;B[qf];W[ii];B[qe];W[gi];B[oe];W[hj]C[I would agree that both of you have good shapes right now, but these shapes should never occur stand alone like this.  In a close knit battle maybe one of these would be beneficial, but go for speed!  Spread across the board before trying to settle anywhere.  It may feel insecure for a couple of games, but you will be amazed at how much you can seperate your stones and stay connected.  The opening is only for loosely sketching your territory fill it in later!]
;B[qq]C[Only try to make 2 eyes when your group is running for its life.  If it is perfectly safe like this, don't waste moves making eyes.  Instead expand in leaps away from the group.  Remember this: when you  are a big/strong group you can expand farther away from it and still remain "connected".  But it is essential to grab the corners before ANYTHING else.

At this point, I'm thinking I'm doing OK.  I'm establishing my presence in the upper right.  What is White doing?  Hmm.  At this point, my goal is to make two eyes and then enclose territory from there.]
;W[oi];B[pd];W[ok];B[pf];W[nj];B[oq];W[pj];B[pp]C[The fact that he is playing the middle concerns me, so I start making my presence felt down below.  I'm still puzzled by his style of play.]
;W[ph];B[pr];W[qi];B[se];W[og];B[rd];W[nh];B[rf]C[Just to clarify: you haven't made any eyes yet.  I want to be sure you understand that both those "false eyes" can be taken away if he were to capture the outer most stone on either side.

Here come my eyes.  What is he doing?  Should I be attacking him at this point?]
;W[ni];B[qg];W[pg];B[rh];W[qh];B[sg];W[ri];B[si];W[sj];B[sk]
;W[sh]C[I start attacking, foolishly.  I should concentrate on my original plan of securing two eyes.]
;B[rj];W[rg];B[si];W[sf];B[of];W[sg]C[So he's ko'ing me to death.  I've lost stones because I failed to join up loose stones into groups.  At least that's what I think.  ???]
;B[rh]C[This is exciting.  It is rare in my games when I capture more than one or two stones at a time.  I'm feeling a glimmer of hope at this point.]
;W[sn];B[sg];W[sl];B[rl];W[rm];B[od];W[qn];B[rs]C[Try to stay away from playing on the first line until the VERY end of the game.  You will automatically be a lot more productive in your moves and sometimes it can get tricky.  So be careful if you ever do play there.  It is a very weak stone that can be captured easily when all by itself.]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[qm];B[rr]C[Really try to visualize where your territory is forming.  It will usually be along the sides and in the corners.  If attacking won't make this bigger, it is a bad idea to do it.  Remember that touching your opponent makes hime stronger.  Try not to touch him even when attacking.  Stay back a few lines and you will find yourself automatically making more territory naturally and forming stronger groups.   Meanwhile your opponent won't be able to lean on your pieces and grow stronger from them.

Trying to get some eyes in the lower right without having secured my eyes in my original group.  Looking back, I feel like I've squandered some opportunities attacking White.  Yes?]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[ql];B[pk];W[rk];B[sj];W[pl];B[qs];W[sh]C[Feeble attemps at attacking yield nothing and lose much.  What should I be doing at this point?]
;B[si];W[ng];B[me];W[nf];B[md]C[Trying to extend.];W[ne];B[nd]
;W[sj];B[rc];W[ji];B[sc];W[ki]
(;B[ma]CR[mc][mb]C[If you are going for anything expand towards bigger territory like the variation I posted.  Look at how much bigger the "implied" enclosure is.  When you are that close to the edge with the large of a group, you can pretty much assume it is closed off.  You don't need to waste moves making sure it really is  closed off until the end of the game.   Also the whole thing on not playing on the first line.]
;W[sh];B[nb]C[Notice how this move actually made your territory smaller than the implied enclosure I showed earlier.  Every move should be aimed at expanding rather than contracting.]
;W[rg];B[oc];W[rh];B[nr];W[sf];B[pb];W[lh];B[ms];W[mg];B[os]
;W[lf];B[lb];W[ke];B[mc]C[Trying to envelop some territory with some shapes that I think I remember, but looking back I see these shapes are not all that smart.]
;W[jd];B[kb];W[jc];B[jb];W[ib];B[ia];W[ha];B[ka];W[hb]CR[fi]
[ei][di][ci][bi][ai]TR[dd][de][bg][bc][ff]C[Let me show you white's implied enclosure now.  Also note that another word for this is framework or moyo.  The triangled area is virtually white's.]
;B[kd];W[je];B[ic];W[le];B[lc];W[hc];B[id];W[hd]C[I have a nice little territory in the upper right, and  now I'm wondering what to do next?]
;B[ie];W[he];B[if];W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[jg];W[mi];B[ss];W[lj]
;B[sq]C[Six wasted stones in the top middle there.  What was I thinking?]
;W[kh];B[kf];W[fi];B[mf];W[lg];B[mq];W[mj];B[lr];W[hk];B[cd]
;W[ei];B[dc];W[di]C[See his cross pattern, centered on H11?  Is that good shape?]
;B[ce];W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[fe]C[At this point I am trying to get a foothold in the next corner, but this time he's fighting me at every stone.  This always shakes my confidence because I don't feel confident that I know good counter-moves.]
;W[ef];B[cf];W[eg]C[And so, see?  He's getting stronger and stronger.]
;B[dd];W[eh];B[fd]C[Boom!  Now he's connected, and what am I doing?]
;W[ed];B[ec]C[Am I trying to capture him?];W[fc];B[gc];W[fb]
;B[eb];W[gb];B[ea]C[Darn!  Now he's connected again!];W[ab]
;B[bb];W[ba];B[cb]C[Hey!  Stay  out of my corner!];W[bc];B[cc]
C[Ha!  Go me!];W[ad];B[ca];W[fa];B[da]C[That's one eye.];W[dg]
;B[bd];W[cg];B[bf];W[bg];B[af];W[ag];B[ae]C[There's two.  Big deal.  Look at his territory!  How did this happen?]
;W[gl];B[ac];W[fl];B[aa];W[el];B[hl];W[hm];B[il];W[im];B[jl]
;W[jm];B[ik];W[ij];B[kk]C[I probably should have tried to extend my lower right groups than hit in the middle of the goban where he's strong.  Yes?]

;B[ak];W[cj];B[bj];W[ci];B[aj]C[The game is over at this point.  I'm just trying to figure out any place to get a few more points.  Or should I pass and quit?]

[sk][sm]C[Overall, try to get the corners first, then the sides, then the middle.  Try to expand along the sides in leaps rather than crawling with your groups.   Don't touch your opponent as much as you think you should.  This only makes him stronger.   Check out the stuff at the beginning of the game.  My email is drgnslyr@twcny.rr.com if you have questions or comments.  I'll be happy to answer them and get back as quickly as possible.

So I lose by ONLY 148 points.  Normally I lose by over 200 points, but I had some rare successes in the top right.  So what am I doing wrong?  A common feeling in my games is that I am being throttled every time I turn around, and I get into such a --- I don't want to say panic -- but I get so frustrated that I start making stupid mistakes.  And the more stupid mistakes I make, the more I make because I get more frustrated.  Frustrated really isn't the word.   I feel like I am just being beaten down by 20 guys.  Overwhelmed.  Help!]

(;B[pp];W[ii];B[dp];W[jh];B[dd];W[ig];B[oc]C[Now, what happened here?   While there is the proverb ponnuki is worth 30 points.  Let me assure you that your position is infinitely better than white's.  I have placed the black stones on the hoshi (star points) for simplicity.  Nothing more necessarily needs to be done to them while you position in the upper right needed an extra stone to close it off.  Believe it or not, this is good enough that you can call all four corners yours right now and move on.  While you may find out as you progress that the hoshi points don't claim any real territory, you are still there first and can benefit greatly from it.]

(;AB[gf][hf][gj][jj][fo][hp]AW[gh][ih][gl][hm][fq][ir]C[All of these (from black to black and white to white from side to side) are considered connected.  Try using these to expand along the board rather than trying to make "good" shapes.  Shapes are results of from groups and battles, so they shouldn't occur right in the beginning.  If your opponent does make a group like in this game, just ignore it and grab the easy points in the corners.]

[pe:4][pf:5][pg:6][ph:7][oh:8][nh:9][mh:10][mg:11][mf:12]C[Here is the theory on why the corners are best then the sides then the middle.  Also remember that you shouldn't close off your territory like this right in the beginning of the game.  It takes 12 stones to get 4 points of territory in the middle.  8 stones along the side.  And 5 in the corner.  Okay, so I hope this won't be too much to digest at once.  Keep playing and stuff will sink in a little at a time.  Most importantly, have fun, and you'll improve faster that way!!]
