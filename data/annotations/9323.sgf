;B[pd];W[oq];B[dd];W[cp];B[pj];W[ci];B[pp]C[This seems a little close. Contact play at P4 for white or invading are both good options now.]

(;W[pm];B[jd]C[I think ignoring Q7 is dangerous here, but let's see how it plays out!

White should be looking to get a nice chunk of points in the bottom side. The weak Q4 stone should be nice leverage to let W do that. There's also the option of pincering Q10, which is what W does this game.]

(;W[lq]C[This was a mistake by W, I think. He's stronger here - he needs to be on the offensive. B should take advantage of the initiative now.]

;B[ll];W[lk];B[kj];W[lj]C[Not sure what W's plan is here. Double atari at M7 won't happen. M10 suggests he's trying to connect to R14, but black easily cuts, and W can easily slip under B on the right side to live anyways.]
