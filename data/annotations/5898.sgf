(;B[eq]C[Is this a good response to WF3? Would BF4 been a better move than BE3?
What has happened here is that white has expanded his moyo and black is concentrated on the left side. A pincer at J4 would have been useful.
The natural continuation here is shown in the variation.]
(;W[fo];B[eo]LB[dn:B]C[Black 9 is a puzzle, B is more standard and helps you take profit and still keeps some pressure on white.
What as the next moves?]

(;B[fd]TR[fj][ek]C[I tend to always question my inital contact moves.  I'm always unsure as to how I should make contact or if I should avoid making contact unless necessary.  Perhaps in a situation like this I should jump to pincer, BH17?

The plays to the 26 / 27 exchange are poor play from both sides. white jumping to F17 is a puzzle - he left the triangle marked stones weak - they need strengthening. The black stones (diamond) are strong so pincer  see variation.]
;W[gd]
(;B[ec]SQ[pc]C[poor response - white can atari and build strenth facing square]

;W[gc];B[he];W[ic];B[eb];W[jj]C[With this move, WK10, I felt I was losing the center position quickly.]
;B[jl]C[I had always heard the motto: from 1 stone extend 1, from 2 stones extend 2.  However, BK8 still seems weak to me.  Is this an alright move?]
;W[ll]
(;B[lj]LB[jl:X][kk:Y]C[This feels like a weak move to me as well.  I know that I need to move into the right side, but at this time maybe I'd be better served moving to the bottom?  Maybe BK6?  Although I could see a follow-up being WM6 then solidifying white's position on the right.
Black 43 is a weak move - you are in White's moyo, so the important thing is to live - get TWO eyes (one is not enough!)

playing where you did means white can cut you off from your friend X by playing at Y.

[hj:BB]C[I'm unsure as to why I made this move. WN14 was obviously going to be the response, cutting of my possibility of a connection to the group of 4 stones below.
You haven't decided which stones you are going to sacrifice
You have better shape and change to make q11 group live
However golden rule only have one weak group - you have two or three
you need to 1) make Q11 live,
2) link m12 group to h15 group
3) you have a threat of AA and BB to weaken white.];W[mf];B[mk]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ok];B[pk];W[pj];B[hc]LB[kk:X][lh:Y][he:Z]C[The timing of this move bothers me. The right side obviously still needs more help.  In fact, I have yet to make a decent living shape on the right side.
There was a crucial fight to makle q11 live and you "went off made a cup o tea and watched the telly" - you are handing the game to white. Have a plan. decide what to save, wht to sacrifice 
cutting through at X and linking Y to Z is one step to being able to have some strength to invade or reduce white's area on the bottom side.]
;W[hb]C[But now that we're back to focusing on the upper left, is there a good way to attack this position?  I shut myself down fairly quickly on it.]
;B[fa];W[gb];B[ib];W[jb];B[oj]C[So, after a half-hearted attempt at the upper left, I'm back to trying to set something up on the right.]
