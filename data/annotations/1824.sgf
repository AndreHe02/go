C[This is a game between

Black: sokrates (30k), me
White: andi (30k), a friend of mine

as we're discussing the games and our mistakes comments for both sides would be appreciated, although most questions in this SGF-file are targeted at my (black's) situation.]
;B[pp];W[ec]LB[de:a][cd:b][cc:c]C[csh: The 3-5 opening is a little unusual, but not unheard of. The move, as it stands, gives up influence along the left-hand side, in favor of influence along the top of the board.

If White does not make a shimari in the corner with 'b' or 'c', Black can approach at 'a' or 'b'. White might want to consider playing the 3-4 point first, and play the 3-5 stone later.]
;B[dp]C[csh: This might be a little advanced, but this stone is in the right direction. White's shimari (corner enclosure) will point down the left-hand side of the board.]
;W[qd]
(;B[pj]LB[de:a][cd:b][cj:c][dj:d][qj:e]C[csh: Approach moves (kakari) in both upper corners are worth a lot more for Black than this extension. I like 'a' or 'b' the best, since they are somewhat supported by the marked black stone. An approach in the upper right is also possible, but White may pincer, starting a fight. I have added two sample approach moves as variations.

That being said, this extension is still good for Black. The shimari in the upper right will point down the right-hand side of the board, so this extension will check White's from extension from his shimari. An extension along the left-hand side to 'c' or 'd' is also a good move, since the upper left shimari will point down as well.

In general, the extension along the fourth line, like 5 or 'd', will have more influence towards the center of the board. Extensions along the third line, like 'c' and 'e', have less influence in the center, and aim to secure territory along the edge of the board.]
;W[ej]LB[cj:a][dj:b]C[csh: Enclosing either of the upper corners is a bigger move for White.
The move played can lead to a dangerous fight; Black could invade  the upper left and possibly leave this stone stranded.

This extension is in the right direction, but it is a little high (too close to the middle) for White. Black can cut under the stone at 'a'. Consider extending to 'b' instead. It still has influence over the center, but Black cannot cut under your extension.]
;B[jp];W[pg]LB[oc:a][od:b][nc:c][ph:d]C[csh: Again, the corner enclosure is a bigger move for White. 'a', 'b', or 'c', would all enclose the corner.

As far as the extension goes, the move is in the right direction. I would enclose the corner first, and then extend down the right-hand side. When the secured corner is reinforcing the extension, it is safe to even extend one line further to 'd'.]
;B[dm]TR[ej]C[csh: This move is a little timid. Black could play one line higher, since the marked white stone is weak.]
;W[cd]C[csh: Good! White encloses the corner. In theory, Black cannot invade there now, without paying a high price.]
;B[qq]SQ[qq]C[could you comment on the opening so far?

any tactical or strategic mistakes here?

what about the current stone on 3-3 - is that reasonable for an effective defense?

csh: Comments on the opening appeared earlier.

Black has essentially opened with a san-ren-sei, while White has used a shimari (enclosure) opening.

The san-ren-sei opening is faster, and has influence towards the center of the board. The idea is to create a big moyo (framework) and then solidify it. Even though the whole bottom half of the board might *look* like Black's territory, it isn't. White can invade along the bottom. This is part of the risk of the 4-4 points.

The shimari opening concentrates on securing territory in the corners and extending from there. White should finish the enclosure in the upper right, and then start extending from there.

As the board stands right now, Black can still approach the upper right corner. White can still invade the lower left corner.

At this stage in your learning, it is probably too early to worry about studying openings. Both players have the right idea: corners first, then extensions along the sides. It is important to enclose the corner quickly, since it will reinforce extensions from that corner later.

The 3-3 point is an effective defense against an invasion in the corner. However, in this case, it may be more valuable to invade in the upper right before White can enclose the corner. As the game turned out, Black was able to invade the upper part of the board before White solidified.]
;W[dl]C[should black see this as an attack?

is it reasonable to attack in this stage?

csh: This is a contact move, so yes, Black should answer. It is reasonable for White to attack, but he must be aware of his weakness in the upper part of the board.]
;B[cm]
(;W[en]C[csh: This move is an overplay. Black will cut. White should stay connected instead. I included a sample variation.]
;B[em]TR[dl][ej][en]C[attempt cut off the white stone

csh: When Black cuts, the three marked stones are weak and White has to worry about all of them. The cut was the right move.]
;W[fn];B[gl]C[double purpose: prevent cutting, enlarge territory to the middle

csh: Prevent whom from cutting where? The knight's moves can be cut. The lower part of the board is not Black's "territory" yet. Black has a framework there, but it can still be invaded.]

(;W[in]C[csh: This move is another overplay. Black can cut off this stone, so there will be four weak groups.]
;B[gn]C[more isolation

csh: The cut was the right idea; separate the weak white stones. The problem is that the black stones are not really connected, either.]
;W[gm];B[fm]C[csh: Good! Keep the white stones from connecting.]
;W[hm];B[go];W[fo]
(;B[fq]TR[en][fn][gn][fo][go]C[trying to encircle the group

csh: This move had the right idea, but it was the wrong move for Black. There is a capturing race between the two marked groups. Black's group and White's group both have three liberties. Whoever reduces liberties first will win the race. See the variation.]
;W[gp]C[csh: Now the black group has only two liberties while the white group still has three. Black is losing the race.]

(;B[kn]C[csh: Black's marked group is in danger! It needs more liberties! See variation.

Black might have been willing to sacrifice the stones, but it would be worthwhile to see if the stones can be saved before giving them up.]

;W[iq];B[jq];W[hr]
(;B[hs]TR[fq][gr][hs][ir][jq]C[csh: The double hane (on both sides, no less!) has many weaknesses. If White just connects, Black cannot protect all of them. It might be better to choose one side or the other. I included a variation.]

(;W[fr]C[white didn't see the atari];B[hq];W[hp];B[er]C[secure more territory in the corner while making an atari threat

csh: Good. The left-hand side was weak.];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]
C[is there any chance that black could catch the white group in this stage? white has only one eye (almost), but may spread to the middle...

csh: It is highly doubtful that Black can capture the white stones. Besides the fact that White already has one eye, the black stones surrounding the white group have many weaknesses.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[kp]LB[jn:a][io:b][im:c][hn:d]TR[hm][in][jo]C[these four hane-stones, isn't that extremely dangerous for white?

csh: The marked stones would be threatened if Black was already pressed up against them. However, these moves are not hane, because they are not wrapping around a black stone. "Hane" is Japanese for "wrapping around the end," and not "diagonal move."

As they stand, they are essentially connected. If Black plays 'a', White could connect at 'b', and vice versa. The same is true of 'c' and 'd'. The idea of either/or is called "miai."

The white stone just played, 46, is in trouble.];B[kq];W[lp]
;B[mq];W[jr];B[kr];W[hr]C[double-atari: black decides to protect the middle-right]
;B[js];W[gs];B[is];W[gr]C[has white now two real eyes?

csh: Yes, white is alive now. Since White is alive now, Black needs to worry about his own stones. White could have waited to make this move later; there was no rush to make it right now.]
;B[mo]C[csh: Good move! The white cutting stones are caught in a net.]
;W[mp]C[  sokrates 30k : fear my tesuji skillz];B[np]C[  andi 30k : ? ich dachte ICH hätte gut gespielt...]
;W[lo];B[ln];W[mn];B[lq];W[fl];B[pm]C[csh: This was a good move. A lot of times beginners get tunnel vision and forget about the rest of the board. Invading the top is also big for Black.]

(;W[cq]C[does an attack make sense at all?

csh: An attack makes a lot of sense. But this isn't the right attack. If black connects, the white stone is all but doomed. There is a proverb, "Never play next to a cutting point." It is better to either cut, or play a little further away and use the cutting point later.]
;B[dq];W[dr]C[mistake from white];B[cr];W[cp];B[co]C[csh: This move seems innocuous. It gives the black groups eye shape, and it attacks the white stones in the corner. It does set up a ko that could have been very important later.]
;W[jj]C[csh: White has the right idea: try to make a framework in the center. The weakness in the upper right will hurt him, though. It would probably be better to enclose the corner first.]

(;B[jd]C[black tries to invade the top

csh: Great idea! It is a little harder to live so far from the edge of the board. Try invading on the third line instead.]
;W[mk]C[csh: White really need to answer Black's invasion. If he doesn't, Black will get several moves in a row and almost certainly live.]
;B[mm]C[csh: Invading is a bigger move. Black is fighting with White over ten or fifteen points, but there is more than that at stake at the top of the board.]
;W[lm];B[kd]C[black is ignoring the fight below to secure more on the top

csh: Right idea, but think bigger. Make a one-point jump or a knight's move towards the edge of the board. If you were on the third line, you could safely make a two point extension. You are trying to create enough room to make eye space, so the bigger, the better. Just don't get cut in half. :)]
;W[ml];B[nn];W[nm];B[md]
(;W[nd]C[csh: White should attempt to undercut instead of trying to stop Black directly. If Black cannot reach the side of the board to make eyes, he will have to run out to the center and try to make them there.]
;B[hd]C[what about these two one-point extensions? do they make sense or are they too risky?

csh: They aren't too risky. However, you need to create eyes, so you need to move towards the edge of the board.]
;W[gd];B[gb]LB[gc:a]C[knight move extension - good?

csh: This is the wrong place for the knight's move. It can be cut. The hane at 'a' is a better move.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[hb]
(;B[id]C[csh: Again, there is a capturing race. The liberty count was three to three. Now Black has lost. See the variation.]

;B[ha];W[ib];B[jb];W[ia];B[ga];W[me]

csh: It is really cramped in the corner. It looks like it will be hard to live. I included two variations.

I think it would be better for Black to extend from the lower left, and then try to live in the corner while threatening to connect to the bottom. Maybe a reducing play along 'a' or 'b' would give the upper left corner something to connect to later on.]

The cut at 'a' can lead to a dangerous fight, though. Black's stone will be cut off, while White could run to other stones for help. Black might be able to reduce the left-hand side as a result, so it could still be good for Black.]
;W[eg];B[lf]C[csh: This is a one-point jump, not a knight's move.]

;W[jh];B[hh]C[could you comment on these four knight-move extensions? are they good?

csh: This move is also adding to the framework. Knight's moves are usually for attacking a group to the right or left. For extending in the center, they are sometimes dangerous because they could be cut. I included comments with the moves.

That being said, these four moves did do what Black wanted to: expand into the center and reduce White's framework.]

[eq][fq][ds][er]C[any comments on that fight?

csh: This fight is really interesting. The ko at 'a' becomes huge, the winner could gain the entire lower left corner. If White wins, he can save the marked white stones.

general questions:

- could you compare white's and blacks strengths? what did black do good, and vice versa?

- are there typical mistakes on either side?

- any training recommendations?

thanks a lot for your review!
tim


csh: The ko in the lower left would have determined the game, but it was left alone. The game was really close, and the two players are well matched. It was an interesting game to review.


White's strengths:

life and death
invasion


Black's strengths:

full board vision
creating frameworks (moyo)
trash talking :)


For both players, I would recommend studying capturing races and the endgame. Winning a capturing race or playing a different endgame could have made the difference in the game.

For capturing races, I recommend reading _The Second Book of Go_ by Richard Bozulich. Chapters 7 and 8 deal with capturing races extensively.

I don't have a good book to recommend on the endgame. There is a book in the Elementary Go series called _The Endgame_ by Ogawa Tomoko and Jim Davies, but I have not read it. I don't know if it is too difficult.]
