C[Hello reviewer.
In this game, I'm Eranorn[3k\].
This game was very close, but fighting the ko was probably a mistake.
I have a lot of questions on it, but please tell about any mistake I didn't notice.

I even have questions about the yose :)

Thanks a lot.

prana: hi Eranom.
thanks for the interesting game. It was fun to review.
Both players showed fighting spirit and good technical skills.
Take the global position more into account and you will get stronger soon!
regards,
prana.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[od];B[pd]LB[mc:E][oc:C][ld:F][pf:D]
[cp:B][dp:A]C[er: I wanna try this. What could I have played considering the 4-4 stone ?

prana: If you like it, play it.
There are various (more common) possibilities to play: A-F for example. 
I personally think your exchange q16,p15 is good for w, because it works well with the w 4-4 stone.]
;W[oe];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pf];W[of]LB[me:A]C[er: Is this a joseki move ?
prana: I would prefer A. In general, you don't want to push on th 5th line.]
;B[pg];W[og]LB[id:A]C[prana: again, I would rather play around A]

(;B[ic]C[prana: quietly playing at q12 is also possible]
(;W[kc]C[prana: Answering from this direction is really painful. w is badly overconcentrated.]
;B[fc]C[prana: b is happy.];W[eb];B[ie];W[ke]C[prana: again, w is too overcocentrated]

(;B[ge]C[er: Isn't it too slow ?
prana: yes, too slow. Try to handle the stones more lightly, they are not in danger, so you can tenuki, and take the 4th corner. Very big!]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[pi]C[prana: the atari is useless (aji keshi), because the stone will be captured.]
;W[oh];B[rh]TR[pf][pg]C[er: Wouldn't I be in trouble with S11 instead of S12 ?
prana: The 2 marked stones would be captured.
Try to read it out.];W[ri];B[rf];W[pe]C[Useless move ?
prana: yes.];B[qe];W[pj]
(;B[qo]C[prana: wrong direction. Dont play against thickness.]
;W[qm]C[prana: Even worse. Much too overconcentrated];B[jp]
C[Is it better to play here or in the last empty corner ?
prana: The corner is bigger.];W[dp];B[cc]LB[cf:B][df:A][cg:C]
[cn:D]C[er: Mistake ?
prana: yes, it is expensive to lose this stone. Better play from outside.]
;W[cd];B[dc]C[prana: what is your plan?];W[ec];B[ed];W[bc];B[fb]
C[Better at E15 ?
prana: yes. outside influence is more important than a few points]
;W[ee];B[fd];W[cb]C[prana: w is lucky.];B[fq]
(;W[dr]
(;B[mq]C[er: What about this move ? Slow ?
prana: yes. try to play more flexibel. If w invades here, you will get compensation somewhere else.]
;W[iq]C[What's the best way to answer that ?
prana: j5 is good.];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[cn]
;W[bo];B[co]C[I was wainting for C4...];W[bp]
(;B[df]LB[cg:A]C[prana: aji keshi. Later, you would rather want to play at A and threaten to cut.]
;W[de];B[cj];W[ch]
(;B[ei]C[er: Aiming at the center... Can I ?
prana: it is not easy to build a moyo when 3 sides are open...
Furthermore, your left group is thin, w has plenty possibilities to attack.
Also, imagine if you had played at e15, playing around here would be much bigger, because it would bemore difficult for w to cut.]
;W[di]
(;B[ej];W[eh];B[eq];W[dq];B[jj]LB[dj:D][nm:A][eo:B][jq:C]C[Is it to early ?
prana: The center mojo is not that big as it may seem. 
W can reduce at the marked points and makes profit easily.
B K3 or Q7 are IMHO bigger.]
(;W[gh];B[eo];W[er];B[gj]LB[dj:B][pm:A][jq:C]C[prana: slow. Still A, B or C are bigger]
;W[do];B[dn];W[il]C[prana: overplay, the stone is too deep in your moyo. Can it live? Don't forget, you have fine forcing moves at q7, q8.
W has a hard time after b L9.]
(;B[kl]C[prana: normally a good move, but in this case too loose. Also, there is not much territorry on the right of L8]
;W[jk];B[kk]C[Now aiming for a big corner.];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji]
;B[kj];W[hi]
(;B[on]C[prana: only around 10p worth.];W[jq]C[prana: very big.]

(;B[kp];W[nl]LB[ol:B][kq:A]C[prana: too loose. better just A. Locally B]
;B[pl]C[er: Overplay ?  Should White play Q7 then P7, P8 ?
prana: yes. If you can read this out, the answer is easy.]
