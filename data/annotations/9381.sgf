C[Hello and thank you for reviewing (:

The game was quite interesting, because B (i.e. not me) had all for corners=
, but it was still quite close. Without the slight loss of concentration at=
 move 170, it would have probably been +/- 0.5 in the end.

I added some questions in the file, but I'd be very happy about general com=
ments, as I probably don't even see where I could have played better.

Thanks a lot,
Tim];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[cf]C[CG: The approach from this side is strange. It's usually better to approach from the "friendly" side, as it would be an approach and an extension at the same time.]
;W[fc];B[bd];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[pm]C[CG: Withe the black stone on 4-4 in the upper right, it's a good idea to play an approach move first. This forces black to decide whether he answers at R14 or R13. If black answers R14 (which he usually does), you play Q7, and at the end of the joseki R11 is the perfect extension. With R14 already played, R13 is no longer a good continuation for black. 
Without the exchange in the upper right, black will have the chance to play R13 in sente.]
;B[on];W[om]C[CG: Why did you choose this variation? Usually you should connect.]

(;B[nq]C[CG: Black doesn't know the joseki he started ... 
The joseki continuation (see variation) gives black quite some profit.]

(;W[nn]C[This move seemed really slow to me, but on the other hand it forti=
fies nicely this group. During the continuation of the game, I was actually=
 somehwat happy, that I played it, but I'm still wondering which would be better options. Just going straight for r11?

CG: This move is good as it forestalls the cut at Q6 (see variation for the last black move).]

CG: R11 is large, but not urgent after O6.];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh]

[dd][dg][dh]SQ[fo][go][cp][dp][ep][fp]C[Is this cut okay in this board situation? W=
e were discussing it afterwards and didn't find a bad version for white. But it feels like a strange exchange and like it shouldn't work.

CG: My first impression was that an exchange of the marked stones is better for black (he gains more points than you). On the other hand, the resulting thickness fits very well with the marked stones at the buttom, and black will have a hard time reducing the moyo.]
;B[de];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff];B[fe];W[gf];B[gc]C[Should B  have play more someth=
ing along the lines of k17 or j17? To threaten me a bit and make territory =
on the upper right? After the following sequence, I felt okay with the resu=
lt of the cut.

(;B[jo]C[CG: No, black must resist here!];W[im];B[km]
(;W[mp]C[R11 would have been better here, I guess?

CG: My first thought would be J9 ...
The right side is unimportant - neither side can make many points there. I think the choice is between reducing the bottom (which you did) and enlarging your moyo.]

C[Maybe pincer instead? But=
 I didn't see a nice follow-up after B connected below. And it would be big=
 for B.

CG: S6 is a good answer. Just make sure you live and keep a foot (S6) in the door for the endgame.]
;B[qi]
(;W[jc]C[CG: Locally a good move, but be careful not to drive black into your moyo ...
I would rather play G15 or D18 in this area. 

But before that, I would play P4 and settle my group in sente.]
;B[ie]
(;W[ec]C[W K16 instead would be better, I guess?

CG: This is a slow move. If you want to play it to reinforce your group, you should induce it by playing G15. On the othe hand, I would like to play J13 here. 

In the variation starting with K6, black secures his corner in the upper right and reduces your moyo - I think this is more than what you gain on the top. Expanding your moyo is the better option.]

then.

1. The group is alive without another move, isn't it?
2. Even if you need to add a move, you should make sure to play out sente moves first and play the biggest move.

This is especially true as the next move seems to kill your corner.
So this is probably the losing move!];B[ob];W[re];B[rf];W[qd]
