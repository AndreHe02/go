(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]VW[]C[Would you please  review the following game for me?
I am a member of the teaching ladder system.  I took white
in this game.  Thanks very much.

Regards,
C. Nin Lei

This game is dominated by all-out fighting, something
both players seem to be strong at.  My advice, to both
players, is to be a bit less obsessed with killing and
look after your own weak groups before starting heavy
attacks on the opponent, since it often pays off in the
long run to be patient.  Also remember that a successful
attack doesn't necessarily mean to kill the enemy group.

KM[0.5];B[dp]C[EE: According to tradition, it is more polite to
play the first move in the upper right corner. :-)];W[pp];B[dd];W[pc];B
[nq];W[pn];B[jp];W[qe];B[jc];W[cj]C[EE: Good move!];B[ql];W[qi]L[qm]
[pl]C[EE: Another  idea is to exchange 'a' for 'b',
to make Black heavy, before pincering.];B[qo];W[po];B[rn];W[qp];B[rp];W
[qn];B[ro];W[qm];B[rm];W[pl];B[pk];W[qk];B[rl]L[pj]C[EE: It's a pity that  White 'a' doesn't work
now; Black has time to pull out his stone and
still get seven stones in sente on the second
line for life.];W[ok];B[pj];W[qj];B[ol];W[pm];B[qq];W[pq];B[qr];W[pr]L[nk][nm][oi][pi][qh][oh]C[EE: This is gote, since it doesn't threaten
the life of the corner group. I recommend 'a'
instead, which makes miai of capturing the
single black stone in good shape with 'b' or
the two black stones with 'c'. If black pushes
at 'd', white follows once at 'e' and still
threatens to capture using 'f'. It would allow
Black to link together his stones by playing
34 himself, but White's resulting strength
would dominate the center and support invasions
on the lower side. White would also have good
prospects of making territory in the top right
quarter of the board.];B[nl]C[EE: After this  move, White will have to play
very carefully.]
(;W[oj]M[qi][qj][qk]C[EE: This doesn't work so well, because white is
pushing black against his weak marked stones.
It looks like better style to set the cutting
stone in motion as in the variation.];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph];W[qh];B[qg];W[rg]
;B[pg];W[rf];B[nh];W[mj];B[mn]C[EE: Now the white wall below is  starting to be
seriously threatened.];W[oh];B[og];W[ng];B[nf];W[mg];B[oe];W[pf];B[pe];W
[qf];B[of];W[lh];B[le];W[rk]M[pl][pm][qm][qn][pn][po][pp][qp][pq][pr]L[ps]C[EE: I assume you played this move, thinking it
threatened the corner and thus being sente, missing Black's sacrifice at s1.  But
even if it *were* sente, and Black played,
for example, 'a' to protect the corner, it
would weaken your marked group, which already
is in acute danger.];B[ll]C[EE: Efter this move, it is even harder for
White to break out.];W[rr];B[rq];W[qs];B[rs];W[ss];B[sq];W[ps];B[so]L[sl]
C[EE: On  principle, Black should play at 'a'
instead, since it has more effect on the
outside.];W[mr];B[nr];W[ns];B[mq];W[lr];B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[ks];B[iq];W
[ir];B[hr]L[hq]C[EE: Black tries very hard to kill. A move at
'a' instead seems more balanced. Having White
crawling on the second line should be good
enough for Black.];W[lq];B[jq];W[lp];B[no];W[ko];B[in];W[km];B[kk];W[jl]
;B[hl];W[jj]L[ik]C[EE: White stakes everything on a semeai. 'a'
would be a calmer way of playing.];B[kj];W[ji];B[jk];W[ik];B[il];W[kl];B
[mk]
(;W[lj]C[EE: White could destroy a Black eye in sente as
in the variation, but it appears as if Black
wins anyway. It is very complicated however,
so I wouldn't be surprised if my conclusions
here were inaccurate. One possibility is shown
in the variation.];B[lk];W[ki];B[ln];W[kn];B[nj];W[ni];B[nk];W[mh];B[lo]

;W[ip];B[gq]M[go][hr]L[fq]C[EE: 123 at 'a' instead would make nice shape
with a knight's move relation to the two marked
stones, and more efficiently hold White in.];W[gp];B[fo];W[fq];B[gr];W[fp]

start a ko here, see variation. That ko remains
an urgent issue for the next 60 moves.]

White appears to win the semeai by one move if
Black ignores this threat. Since Black has run
out of local ko threats, White saves his big
group, but Black gets two moves in a row
elsewhere, so he keeps his lead.

liberties, hence Black has to defend and White
wins the ko.

groups still lack sure eyes, that the white
marked group in the center is rock solid

in my opinion have no problems looking after
himself. Black would do better by confining
White to live in the corner.])
