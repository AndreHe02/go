AB[jd][dj]C[Hi,

Here is your review. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

You made some tactical mistakes. But most of all, there are two important points you should keep in mind:

1. Make territory! 
2. Don't follow your opponent around. Don't play somewhere just because white played there before. It's good practice to always ask yourself "is this really the most important point on the board? Is there not some more important place where I could play instead?"

The player who has the initiative in a game has the highest chance to win.]

(;B[dd]C[Am I right to attack or should I play near k4?

Maere: the corner around K4 is the biggest point on the board right now  (which is why your opponent ignores your attack and takes it). 

An approach move on D11 is less important at that stage. But what if you do wish to attack anyway? It can be done.
But even in this case, D10 is wrong. You don't attack with contact play, it's ineffective. Contact play is for defense. I know it's not how it feels, but have a look at the variations.

What should be your aim when attacking so early in the game? Not killing a group.  Your aim should be to settle a safe position in the corner and along the edges. Next you can use your settled groups to develop towards the center.  Look at the variations for examples.]

(;B[lg]C[Here you should have played L7 instead of M7.
Note that when white plays N7, he's missing a weakness in your position. He could cut at L7, or at L9. 
I show you what can happen here in the variation. Don't bother to learn the details, just remember that joseki is M7.]
(;W[mg];B[mh]C[Remember to never play that move, ever again, and your rank will  go up ;-) And if your opponent plays it,  punish him gladly just like white did. Don't be afraid of N8. It doesn't work.]
;W[lh]C[Look at what happens if you play N8 here.]
(;B[kg]C[is this move better than n8 ?   How to handle m6 ?

Maere: Well, the right way to handle it is by not letting it happen, that is, not playing M7, and most of all not playing N6. But once M6 happened, you have no choice but to play L7. As you can see in the variation, you an't escape capture with N8.

L7 has the added benefit to repair your mistake of earlier and make your wall more solid.]

(;B[ka]C[This move is unnecessary. What is the worst that could happen if you don't play it? White could play there instead. That's worth 1 point territory. There are much bigger moves to make around the place.]
;W[ki]C[This doesn't look like a good move from white. It feels slow. Seems he's worried about you shutting his group in. But  I think either L6 or K6 would have accomplished the same purpose with more efficiency.]
(;B[ih]TR[ka][jb][kb][jc][jd][ke][kf][kg][lg]C[Alright, have a look at the board: white has about 10 points of safe territory, and some good prospects on the lower side.
What you have, on the other side: no territory whatseover.
 
Try not to be behind in territory. As a more experienced player you can afford to let the other player be ahead in territory if this is part of your long term startegy, but as a beginner you should try to make points first. 

What  you do have is a nice solid wall (triangle stones) which gives you  good prospect on the upper side.
So now would be the time to use this potential and grab some points, either by going back to the upper left corner, or by plaing on the lower side.

J6 starts to shut in the white group, but even after this move white has still a lot of space to develop along the edge, while you haven't added to your advantage much.]

[ld][md][me][mf]C[This is one of white's strategic mistakes that nearly costed him the game. 

He's going for a 3-3 invasion, exactly as he did on the top. Now look how it ended for him just a moment ago: 
- the white stones make territory. The black stones make no territory
- BUT the black stones have space towards the center. They can still develop. The white stones have no potential for development. They are shut in. 

When your stones are shut in, you can't use them as a base to do other things, like attack a group or develop in the center. This is exactly what happens to him. This is the normal outcome of a 3-3 invasion. Now white is doing it again, allowing you to build another big wall and getting shut in. He'll repeat the same mistake on the upper left, until you end up with a big territory in the center that he almost forces you to build.]

;B[bk];W[bl];B[ak];W[al]C[Right now this game is completely unbalanced on both sides:
You don't have a single point of territory yet!
White has safe positions, but they're no use to them because they are surrounded. His only exit point is G6. This is bad.]
;B[cg]C[You finally start making territorry. However, B4 is a serious weakness. You need to protect that first.]
(;W[cc];B[cd]C[If you look at this position, you'll see it's similar to the ones you got on the upper right and lower left corners, right after you answered a 3-3 invasion.
Don't try to kill these two white stones. There are so many ways to make two eyes in the corner. Instead of trying to kill, you should think about letting whit live but still getting a good position.]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[da];B[fa];W[cb];B[bc]C[How could I kill the c12 group ?

Maere: You can't. All you can do is make white live small.]
;W[bb];B[ab]C[Here you need to play B10 or B9 to prevent what is going to happen next.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[ae];W[bc]C[Don't understand... this move is unnecessary.]
;B[hh];W[gi]C[No need to be afraid of that. This group has four liberties left. It's not in any danger at the moment.]

;B[gg]C[Good. This move is very bad for white.];W[eh]C[So, here we are. White has all corners, but you have a huge territorry in the middle which must now be painfully reduced, and he waited too long to do that efficiently. This is really no good for white. If it hadn't been for the weakness at B4, you would have won this game.]

(;B[db];W[cc];B[eb]C[Here I'm NOT trying to kill white, I'm merely threatening to, and make a moyo on the upper side in the process. Now white has to worry about his position. While he's busy strenghtening it, you can quietly build up your own.

Note that your stones on the left benefit from the influence of the black wall on the right. Makes them safer. If white tries to invade for example at G11, you can chase him and give him a hard time.]

(;W[cc]C[So, at the beginning there was a white stone with four liberties.
You made a contact play and took a liberty away. 
White extends to defend the corner: the white group has now five liberties. You have only three left, and white's group is perfectly safe. Not good.

Note that because you've made white play on the 3-3 point, the corner is now his, as you've experienced later. You can't kill this group, and you've pretty much destroyed any prospects to take at least part of this corner.]
