;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pc];B[qq]LB[qp:b]C[This is a mistake by Black. To invade the 3 3 point this early
in the game is foolish. He is asking to be punished severly.

You played at 'a' next. This is far to submissive. Remeber the
proverb. Block on the largest side. So  you should have blocked at 'b'. Please see the variation,]

(;W[qo];B[pq];W[oq]LB[op:b]C[The marked w stone is very bad a play at 'b' would have been
better. Remember don't play in a way that will give your opponent
forcing moves. Playing this way leaves you very thin.];B[or]

what you want.];W[op];B[np];W[rp];B[mr];W[no];B[lq]C[This B move was poor. This is called a "thank you" move he is
forcing w to play a stone he wanted to make already.];W[mp]

enclose your corner at the top. See the variation.];B[dq];W[dr]

(;W[cs]TR[cs]C[You must learn to play lightly. Now I know you are a begginer
but you may as well try to absorb as much as you can from the
onset. When you play like this here you must ask yourself what
am I trying to accomplish? Also look how many cutting points
you are leaving. Now lets say instead of the marked stone you
played 'a'. See variation];B[er];W[lp];B[kq];W[jp];B[fq];W[ep]

been better. See variations.];B[pi]
(;W[gn]C[This move is okay but ill timed I think. You would have been
better to attack the marked B stone right now. See variation.]
;B[fn];W[pf]C[Now this move was okay but becuase it was high it just begged
for b to play 'a' which he did. I would have played 'a' first
then looked forward to making an extension on the top as I showed
you in earlier variation.];B[qg];W[qf];B[rf];W[re];B[rh];W[pg]
LB[cj:d][ic:c][jc:b]C[This move is small an extension to 'b' or 'c' much better. Or
invading at 'd'];B[ph];W[sf]C[Small again. Any of the moves suggested on the last move are
still better. Try to ask yourself each move you make. Is this
move worth 1,2,5,10,15 pts.
Don't play small moves when there are much bigger on the board
or your opponent will take them.];B[rg];W[qm]LB[cj:d][ic:c]
[jc:b]C[Again thios is small and not really an attack on the 'b' group
as it can run to the senter. So a move at 'b' 'c' or 'd' still
would have been better.];B[ql];W[pl];B[qk];W[rl]C[This move is small again the big points I have been showing you
are still better. This move also just asks B to play a move he
wanted anyways.];B[rk];W[sk]C[Now this move was really bad. I say this oy so you learn to READ
AHEAD (smile) Why B played at 'a' is foolish I would have played
as the variation and taken all your stones.]

(;W[ec]LB[cc:d][fc:c][cf:b]C[Now your move here is another thing I have been meaning to mention.
This is an improper kakari (approach move) You should either
approach from 'b' or 'c' or invade immediatly at 'd' Okay?

Lets go back one move and look at the variation with a proper
approach move.

I will conclude my review of your game here. The things you must
work on are   1) basic approach moves and pincers.
2) Learn what are small moves and big moves
3) Study the provebs they will point you in the right direction
to learn more. The proverbs are available on the internet. If
you can't find them write me I will point you in the right direction.
4) I would if you can afford to purchase from the "Elementary
GO series"     1) In the Begining (Very Important)
   2) 38 Basic Joseki
   3) Life and Death (Very Important)
   4) Tesuji (Very Good Book)

Later on order the rest of the series. But these 3 books will
propel you to beating the B player handily.

5) Learn to read a few moves ahead.  6) Play thicker. You play to thin and leave many cutting points
in your position.
7) Learn how to play lightly. DOn't allow your opponent to make
your groups heavy, becuase heavy groups are a burden.
8) Don't play near thickness - yours or your opponents. Try to
force your opponent to play near yours.

Good luck and send me another game in the future if you like.
But study the proverbs at least before you submit another game
to me for reveiw.

And remember GO is one darn tough game so keep workin at it and
have fun.];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[ed];B[eb];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cf]

 Try to read a few moves ahead. Start your next game looking
3 moves ahead at least and then try to see as many variations
as you can within those three moves. Start using the variation
that looks like it will work for you. Learn what thickness and
influence does for you on a global (full board) scale. Okay?]

(;W[er];B[hr]TR[hr]C[When Black plays the marked stone you cannot make an extension.
So now your group is heavy. Heavy groups are a burden to look
after and if you just abandon this group black makes lots of
territory. So lets say you try to cave it by playing at 'a'.
You just help B to make territory and your group is still eyeless
and heavy. There must be a better way than this.];W[ep];B[do]

you are threatening an extension to 'a'

out of schico. So remember dead stones have aji (potential) and
can allow you to make manuevers on another area of the board.

the marked schico breaking stone.];B[dh]C[Now we pa a well known joseki.]

gets sente and his postion works well with his marked stone.
So this may not be the best way for white to go but it is safe.
The problem with this joseki is that the B poknuki works so well
with the bottom stone and as I said before B has sente.  You must learn that sente and gote are not just words but a powerful
part of go. Sacrificing 1 or 2 stones to gain sente is often
worth it.])

not make a full extension becuase of the white thickness below.
