C[Hi, this is a serious game (25 min + 5x1:00) I played as white.

I would appreciate to have a review of it to try to step up my go. So please tell me the main flaws you can see in my way to play.

Thank you very much !

J: Hi my name is Jay and I will be reivewing your game.  My comments will start with "J:".]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[dh]C[J: Im not too fond of the extension here for black.  White can play C16 to make black over concentrated.  See Variations.]
(;W[jc]C[J: C16 would be big right aout now.];B[fq];W[ip]TR[cn]
[hq]C[Astralth : Here i played the pincer to avoid letting black take the bottom and threaten to take q10 after, is that right ? Is it the right pincer?

J: I would consider a lower pincer here since the right side is black's.  A black move at L3 later would be a go point for black.  But either is fine.  The simple C6 would also suffice.]
;B[fo];W[dn]C[J: D6 can be at C6, considering that there's already black stones at the top.]
;B[jo];W[gp];B[fp];W[hn];B[dr]C[Astralth : I have met this situation several time and always failed to find a good response to that (in my opinion). Was the plays in the corner wrong for the beginning or is there a good response for white ?]
;W[cq];B[cr];W[ck];B[co]C[Astralth : now begins the problems I was talking about ... maybe white c9 is too light ?

J: C9 is important for stabilizing the white group.];W[do];B[bq]
(;W[cn]C[J: C6 should be at B4.  White will get a better position.  See Variation.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[bo]C[J: Black should play F7 now.];W[bn];B[ap]
;W[fm]TR[gn][gm]C[Astralth : I wondered if this move was too small, since i should play big points such as R10 first, but I was concerned about black attaking my h6 group.

J:  This is move it important to help the H6 group.  There is a cutting point around G6 but if he cuts it now, it will only strenthen the H6 group.]
;B[ho];W[io];B[go];W[jn];B[ko];W[np]TR[cd][qn]C[J: The O4 approach as rarely good. Black can sacrifice the L5 group to develop his right side.  J2/M6 would be two good points for black to reduce later. 

As for attacking, because of the G6 cut, white is better off not starting a fight yet, a good idea is to attack the two black stones now, and in the process fix the g6 cut.

I'd think about a low approach from the other side to break up the right side; or attack the D15 group with C16.]
;B[pn];W[nn];B[ln]C[J: Black can O3 now.];W[pq];B[qq];W[op]
C[J: P3 instead of P4.  That way, you can look at R5 later.]
;B[po];W[pr];B[qr];W[mq]C[J: N3 is waayy too soft. Attack and reduce with O8.  Q2 stone are not important now.]
;B[kq];W[jq]C[Astralth : I think black should run now

J: black needs to keep white separated.];B[lq]C[J: L2 is more effective for black.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[nl];B[ll];W[km];B[lm]C[Astralth : I wondered if I could play o10 safely, then decided to play p7 but now I think it may have reinforced black's right side.]
;W[om]C[J: P7 is ok.];B[ql];W[jk];B[mo];W[mp];B[no];W[lo]C[J: M5 isn't a threat, as the M3 group can make a seki.  See variation.]
(;B[kn];W[oo]C[Astralth : These last few moves may have got me into trouble, should I have sacrificed m4 ?

J: It doesn't look like you'll be any better without M4.];B[mn]
;W[on];B[or]C[Astralth : maybe I should tenuki here

J: yes, O11/Q9 would be nice.];W[oq];B[jm];W[in];B[gn];W[kl]
;B[gm]C[Astralth : Maybe m9 but I didn't want to start a fight that could cost me the game if I lost it (as I often do)

J: Black must run the M8 group out here.]
(;W[hl]C[J: You should definately start the fight here.  It's hard to see how black can win.]
;B[kk];W[jl];B[nr];W[mr];B[ps];W[ms];B[os]
(;W[lk]C[J: White has a better chance of catching black with a farther surround with M10.  See Variations.]
;B[mk];W[kj];B[ml];W[oj];B[lj];W[qj];B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[pk]
C[J: white can make the O11 -> N10 trade first.];B[oi]C[Astralth : maybe start a ko ?

J: Just capture.];W[pj];B[pl];W[pm];B[qm];W[ni];B[mj];W[ol]

J: agreed.]
(;W[mf];B[pf];W[le];B[ph];W[jr]C[J: White is about 15 points behind on the board.]
;B[ek]C[Astralth : At this point I really wasn't sure where to play, my plan was to attack the two fourth line stone to either make territory in the left or stabilize my upper side. I wondered about c18 now.

J: C16 maybe enough.  White can stabilize his group with B10 or F8.]
(;W[ej];B[fl];W[em];B[gl];W[dk]C[J: D10 instead of D9 feels stronger.]
;B[dj]
(;W[cj]C[J: White can take D10 with D11.];B[di];W[cd];B[fi]
;W[df]C[Astralth : This move felt a bit strange but I played it anyway ^^]
(;B[cf]C[J: Black can fight heavily with D15, as the corner becomes weak.  See Variations.]

J: yes.];B[fh];W[gd]C[J: White can simply enclose with J14 instead of making the g16 trade.]
;B[he];W[if]
(;B[ig]C[Astralth : h14 might be better for black ? (at least the shape is the so called "alien symbol" of get strong at go]

J: Eee, this doesn't look good for white.  It's difficult to find another ko threat though.]

;W[sq];B[sp];W[rs];B[qs];W[so];B[sj];W[ri];B[sl];W[pb]C[J: surprsingly, the game is still very close.  This will be my last comment.

The key take-aways from this game should be to attack from strength.  It is very difficult to use a weak group for attacking.  Also look to attack from a distance, touching a group usually makes it stronger.

Thanks for showing me this game.];B[qc];W[si];B[sn];W[qb];B[rb]
