C[[xedover\]: you asked mostly about your invasion into White's large moyo later in the game. Most of my comments, even early in the game, should relate in some way to that invasion.

you played very well for only your 5th game

but your opponent out played you early on because you would shrink back from his attacks (something I'm very guilty of myself). you prevaled later by taking advantage of your opponent's inexperience in local fights.

two main things you need to work on:
1) look for the bigger, more urgent points earlier in the game. don't fear the white stones.  ignore the psychological effects of playing against a "higher ranked" opponent.  push back against his attacks.  attack him while you defend. or ignore his attacks and attack him somewhere else
2) practice life and death problems to better recognize when your own groups are already alive. A quote I learned just today: "making an unnecessary reinforcing move is equivalant to passing your turn" -- Florescu Ion 6d

I hope my comments are helpful. you're welcome to ask me more questions if I didn't explain something well enough. I hope you continue to enjoy the game as you strive to improve]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[dc];W[qp];B[jd]C[emphyrio: You're not bad, how long you've been playing ?]
;W[oo]C[OpiHart: this is about my fifth game];B[bd]CR[ce]LB[od:A]
[pj:B]C[emphyrio: Greets.
OpiHart: but i've been reading the "let's play go" books
emphyrio: I've been reading "Hikaru no go"...

[xedover\]: an unusual move. While it certainly secures the corner, it does little else. You could have easily played higher at C15 and secured more of the corner. Myself, I would have been looking around P16 or Q10 to keep white from getting the entire right side early on (and so you won't have to invade later).]
;W[oe];B[dj];W[jj]LB[jj:A][pj:B][jp:C]C[A - I think that white became aggresive here a little bit too early, especially when there were still the sides at B and C without claimants.

C - I played here on the next move, extending my influence along the sides.

[xedover\]: perhaps you're right, yet his center stone seemed to prove useful for white a little while later in the game, giving White an early lead.]
;B[jq];W[mo]LB[mc:B][mf:D][qg:1][qj:F][km:E][qm:2][jo:A][mq:C]
C[[xedover\]: now I can see that you're asking yourself, "where should I play next?"

There is a proverb - play at the edge of two moyos. D or E would have been good attacking moves either giving more strength for a later invasion at F, or making an invasion there unnecessary by reducing white.

B or C are also good cash in the bank moves, but would do little as far as attacking White.

Or now might have been a good time to just invade near F. If White approches on one side, you can expand to the other with plenty room to escape into the center if necessary.]
;B[jo]C[[xedover\]: too timid. you're inviting White to make moves he wants to make anyway.]
;W[kn]C[[xedover\]: see, White wanted to make this move. By threatening to push in here, you've allowed him to make a defensive block that he wanted to make. Instead of threatening to invade, just go ahead and invade.]

(;B[go]C[[xedover\]: no need to shrink back here. Instead, keep the pressure on white. You have nothing to fear from a White invasion here. In fact, you want white to try and invade so you can kill his weak invasion inside your stronger groups. Because even if white invades here and lives, he will live small and you will have strengthened your groups even more. (see variation)]
;W[ko]
(;B[jp]C[[xedover\]: not necessary. think about where white is most likely to play next. probably not there. more likely white will turn at the head of these stones, severely reducing you.]
;W[jn]C[[xedover\]: ...and white continues to strengthen his large moyo]
;B[in];W[je]LB[ie:A][ke:B]C[[xedover\]: Again, I can see that you're asking yourself where to play next -- maybe A or B?. I think I would have chosen B, giving black perhaps an easier push into white's large moyo]

(;B[df]LB[fj:A]TR[ef][ff][eg][eh]SQ[fg][fh][gh]C[[xedover\]: Playing at A instead of D14 was much more urgent now. Why? 1) white's group is already trapped and has no where to run, and 2) black's group is running short on liberties and is in danger of being caught in a ladder/net,since you didn't cut earlier.]

(;B[gi];W[gj]
(;B[ei];W[fj];B[ih]LB[ih:A]C[A - Yes, this wasn't a smart move because it is too easy to be cut of, which white would do on Move 48.

[ln][mn][nn][on][pn][qn][rn][sn]C[emphyrio: nice

[xedover\]: yes, white didn't see the snapback

but these last 40-50 moves are all endgame moves that should have been saved for later (even if your opponent doesn't want to wait til later, then let him have a few stones while you go get something even bigger)

see now how with these endgame moves we have helped white build a nice strong wall securing an almost sure win for white as its practically too late for an invasion..]
;B[qi]LB[qi:A]C[A - This is the start of my invasion which most interested me. I wanted to be far enough away from the live white stones in the lower right and the strong knight setup in the upper right to live, but I have no idea if this was the best choice. Also, I kept two spaces away from the edge so that it would be hard for white to cut me from the edge.

[xedover\]: this invasion started way too late. there were many, many earlier opportunities to jump in here. but White's inexperience allowed you to live inside, and even though I'm not sure that you should have been able to live here, it never hurts to try.

see: http://senseis.xmp.net/?10x10CornerGame1];W[pi]TR[as]C[[xedover\]: this and the next several moves are white's losing moves. and soon white makes several forcing plays that only strengthen black and weaken white.]

;B[nj]LB[qg:A]TR[ql][rl]C[[xedover\]: good! you see the ladder. better to sacrifice two stones and let white live on the side.

Or if white opts to reduce your eyespace on the upper side, then you can still kill white's two stones there for your second eye.]

(;W[ph]LB[qg:B][qm:A]C[[xedover\]: mistake - white should have either taken black's two stones (and his second eye) or reduced his eyespace on the upperside]
;B[pg];W[qh]LB[qh:A]C[A - White shouldn't have stepped into this ladder.]
;B[rh];W[qg];B[qf];W[ri]LB[rg:D][qi:B][ri:A][qj:C]C[A - White tries to rectify the situation by threatening B and C, but D is open for the ladder to be captured.]
;B[rg]LB[rg:A][ql:B][rl:C]C[A - Black captures the ladder. At this point, all the black pieces on the right side of the board, except for B and C, are living.

[xedover\]: very nice invasion. the game is now black's

White needs more practice with capture Go on small boards in order to learn to protect his weak groups and not get captured in local fights.

Black, your fighting skills are good, but you need to work on finding the bigger point moves earlier in the game so you do not get so far behind.

White should have won this game, but you prevaled over his inexperience with local fights.]
