C[Hi.
Here is my game.

Hi, I am Kheng Hun, (Singapore 2d), and I will be commenting on this game with kh: at crucial moves. Do look at some variations i suggested in the branch lines.

Overall, I noticed that you like to play moves which poke your opponent and try to get him to connect. Be careful of such trades, since sometimes the opponent group becomes stronger and helps him cut you better. 
Also, watch out for the shape of your stones. For example, move 77 which leaves a chance for white to break your position.

Do look out for the entire board situation. Your opening moves are logical and pressure your opponent with good strength. However you need to ensure safety of your groups, saving the top left before you get attacked. Also look for large areas, especially double sente moves (check it out in senseis library if you haven't heard of it). You don't always need to follow your opponent around by responding to every move in the endgame.

All the best for your future games! Feel free to contact me through email for any further questions or other games to review. :D

;B[gp];W[gq];B[eo]C[looks like mistake. this stone gives me nothing

kh: yes, if you want to play here then choose B4 to get the corner territory. This move forces white to connect, which helps him gain strength to cut at c7 later]
