;B[df];W[md];B[id]C[H17 is better for B. If B H17 here, W has to operate F17 directly ---   B is directing the fighting the way he wants to, instead of following  W's lead.]
;W[ib];B[ic];W[jb];B[gc];W[hb];B[ge]C[If to seperate W's stones is the idea, G18 is the move. B G18, H17,   G16, H16, L16... W's still in dangerous and the corner is safe.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[fb];B[db];W[cn];B[cj]C[B should C8. C10 is too loose; thus, W has several choices here.]
;W[fp];B[co]C[Up to now B was playing ok, but this move was too different from others.   B should D6, D7, E6, C5, E4... and it is up to W to choose where lower   or left side. In handi game, B should use his extra stones as base to   attacking, not as bank --- place that he could pull territory from.]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[ep];B[eq];W[do];B[cp];W[pf]C[Although B got the corner, now Q10 can only receive limited help from   other stones once it is under attack.]
;B[pg]C[This doesn't look good. By playing Q13, B strengthed Q14, weakened Q16...   Q15 is the play here. If W trys to operate N16, R14 in under fire. So   there is nothing to worry about as far as Q10 is concerned... On the other   had, if W operates Q14, the whole K18 group will have to get 2 eyes.   Seperating W's stones is the idea.]

;W[nh];B[oi];W[rg];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi]C[B has to live Q17, and gave W the chance take out the corner. And note:   B N18 is sente here, W is not 100% alive yet.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[de];B[ed];W[ee];B[cd]C[F16! What could W do to the corner if B F16? B17 the most. If W B17,   B C17, W could only get one eye from the corner, and will be under b's   attack... Besides, B has nN18... Well, B has to F16, and G18 first. Then   W has to live the upper group first. B could attack W's D15 group.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[ef];B[fg]C[Since B played C16, B'd better take B15 now. C16 for territory in corner;   F13 to attack? Were that two totally different commands issuded back to   back? Your moves ought to work together to achieve a single purpose...   not two different goals like this. Besides, b's corner is not solid yet.]

;W[bc];B[ca];W[ab];B[ba];W[ea];B[ff];W[pq];B[ae];W[da];B[qm]C[Is Q0 group not strong enough? Why get a narrow expension from your   strong group? H3 is the play here. If W play at the lower side next...   B F6 to attack the D6 group. B has strength at the upper, no reason not to   use it. If W play F6 after B H3, O3 is the next move for B.]
;W[kq]C[Try to count the territory here, B is behind now. B has nothing but the   lower-left corner. W has 3 corners and the lower side. The only hope left   for B is to attack D6 group at F6. But the preparation is not done yet.]
;B[on];W[np];B[dl]C[The same mistake made by B as R7 --- expend from its strong part.]

For handi game, the way to success is to cut the connection of W   and keep B's connection safe; and think about how to pressure w actively   instead of draw back to corner passively. Once the upper-right corner was   gone, game was about to over; once the D6 group was safe, game over. I   could only point the major strategic mistakes for B; it is up to B himself   to correct the tactic errors.]
