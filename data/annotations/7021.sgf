[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game for the white side. My comments are enclosed in double brackets.\]\]

[[The review request asked for tips on how to avoid letting your opponent carve out an enormous center territory.  Hey, I'm only a 5k myself, and tend to be fairly corner- and edge-oriented, so this issue comes up in my own games!  But I'll share my thoughts as we go along, and maybe we'll both learn something.\]\]]

[pg:A]C[[[This isn't joseki.  Joseki moves would have been A, B, or C.  Not that I expect you to have memorized a whole bunch of joseki - I certainly haven't - but this looks to me like the first move that is actually bad rather than a matter of personal preference, and we're about to see why.  (First, look at the variation.)\]\]]

(;B[pe]C[[[Lucky: Black doesn't take advantage of your bad shape.\]\]]
;W[pc]C[[[If you wanted the corner, why didn't you play 8 at R17?\]\]]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[oc];W[ob];B[qg];W[nc]C[[[Aren't you worried about all the cutting points you're leaving by playing this way?\]\]]
;B[od];W[lc]C[[[Later this area will turn out to be one of the only gaps through which you might be able to enter Black's center territory.  You'll want to extend down to N15 or something.  But you won't be able to.  Why not?  Too many cutting points.\]\]]
;B[op];W[qn]C[[[Okay, I think I may see one reason Black ends up with a big center territory.  You're playing very low.  You've played ten stones so far, and D4 is the only one higher than the third line.\]\]]
;B[on]LB[oq:B][qq:A]C[[[The joseki play here for Black is at A.  This suggests to me that you might want to consider B as your next move to solidify your position.\]\]]
;W[pl]C[[[Dubious.  You're not really putting pressure on Black, since you're basically forcing him to do something he wanted to do anyway - extend from those two stones on the lower right - while not strengthening your own position.  You're open to a later black play at R10, and since you haven't played P3, your own stones aren't secure yet.\]\]]
;B[lp];W[cn];B[dr];W[ci]C[[[It looks like you selected this point because it's halfway between your C6 and the black stone at C16.  I'm not sure that's really the best methodology for determining how far to extend.  C11 looks too far away from C6 to be an extension and too far away from C16 to be a kakari.\]\]]
;B[ed]C[[[Black's top left is looking big.  How does C11 help you against it?  How does C11 help you in the bottom left?\]\]]
;W[hq]LB[cq:B][dq:A][eq:E][fq:D][fr:C]C[[[Again, this may be the midpoint between the black stones at D2 and M4, but that doesn't make it the best place to try for a split.  These four white stones don't look to me like they work well together.\]\]

[[For the record, here are what I have read are five standard replies for White, in order of popularity.  I haven't tested them myself.\]\]]
;B[fq]
(;W[ho];B[fo];W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[dq];W[ep];B[cp];W[fr]C[[[There are lots of ways to secure your E4 group, and this looks small to me.  You've given up the corner, so you've sort of committed yourself to building something on the outside.  In general, you want to be wary of playing on the second line this early in the game.  I'd look at something around G7 instead.\]\]]
;B[fs];W[gr];B[co];W[do];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[cm];B[gp];W[gq]
;B[eo];W[fq]C[[[This is ugly.  Black's E5 group is a target, but so is White's enormous lump of stones.\]\]]
;B[em];W[go];B[dl];W[cl];B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[dj];B[gn]
(;W[cq]C[[[No.\]\]

[[Look at Black's E7 group.  Now that's a juicy target!  Will you be able to kill it?  Nah, probably not - killing is hard.  But look at the variations below to see what happens if you keep up the attack!\]\]]
;B[bq]LB[cq:60]C[[[Okay, so Black couldn't very well ignore 60.  You've wasted a ko threat, but the ball's back in your court.  And...\]\]]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[bn]LB[bo:62]C[[[Terrible exchange for White!  You just lost sente, and in exchange for what?  Maybe three points?  62 was a gote endgame move.  And now...\]\]]
;B[hn]C[[[Ouch. Very bad news for White.\]\]];W[io];B[hk]C[[[Hmm, I think Black could afford to press more.\]\]]
;W[jm];B[in];W[jn];B[jo];W[ko];B[jp];W[kp];B[ip]C[[[Black should have read this out.\]\]]
;W[hp];B[ir];W[jq];B[iq];W[jr];B[kq];W[is];B[kr];W[hr]C[[[Okay, this was a lucky break for you.  Your stones are now secure, and are wedged in between two attackable black groups.\]\]]
;B[pq]
(;W[qh]C[[[This move looks to me like a huge mistake.  There are two reasons for this.  One, you need to keep up the attack on Black's lower right stones.  Two, even if you did want to play around here, this is the wrong move locally.  Don't attack with contact.  You're about to make Black much stronger.\]\]]

[[1) How does playing low positions in the opening, and grabbing edge/corner positions during the early fights while your opponent builds outside walls, affect the ultimate boundaries of your territories?\]\]

[[2) How might leaning on weak groups allow you to both keep enemy territory small while building walls of your own that you can then use to project power all over the board?\]\]

[[3) How is your ability to lean on weak groups compromised when your own positions are full of cutting points?\]\]
