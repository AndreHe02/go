Dear reviewer! In this game I (Black) feel my opponent of about the same level has totally different strengths and weaknesses than I have. In the end I win by a good five points (he resigned just before counting). I made a mistake in a joseki in the beginning and caught up when I managed to grab a corner. For me, playing faster games seems to reveal bad instincts and I would like to know about them. I have also put some questions at specific moves. Thanks for reviewing this game.

Dear Andr√©,

as a rule slow games are preferred for review, you probably can tell most mistakes from your rapid games yourself, if you sit down and replay them. Sorry, I had the review ready for a while but forgot to send it earlier.]

tapir: I found the flurry of activity quite surprising. J3 for White would never have occurred to me, while you run out easily you didn't exactly gain anything in the process, i.e. it doesn't look like you are attacking, but more like running with two groups. Certainly what transpired here hardly amounts to fighting. Everything is saved and nothing sacrificed

Why is nobody playing in the top right?];W[lk];B[nc];W[kc]
(;B[mi]C[tapir: This move tries to achieve a lot (enlarge moyo, threaten white group, avoid funny business at q7), however, it is not clear whether it achieves any of these objectives at all. 

+ Just look back at the board before the whole sequence since J3, it would definitely be easier to enlarge the moyo if you had not driven White into it with the whole "fight".]

;W[ig];B[al]LB[fk:B][fm:A]C[I thought I can still attack White, but one of my weaknesses is also to forget about points like A and B, because I can never figure out how to defend in sente, if possible.

tapir: As a matter of principle you should defend when it is necessary (sometimes hard to tell, yes), but it is no good to do so only when possible in sente and leave your groups to their fate otherwise. However, here I don't see any obvious attack for White, given that her stones at C2 etc. are dead.]
