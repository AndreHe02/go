Hi, I'm Sam Aitken from the UK. I play as aitkensam on KGS is you have any questions about the review feel free to message me!]

;B[ql];W[pn]C[first question i have is here:
i know that R5 is the usual move but some days ago ang li 3p showed me R3 i just couldnt remember how to continue then and if the result in the game is ok.]
;B[qq]C[Hmm, I am not familiar with this move.
I have put in a couple of variations that seem normal to me]

(;W[pl]C[This move also seems fine for w];B[pk]C[and this answer must be the only move]
;W[ol]C[I feel like this white move is a little bit slack.
See var]
(;B[no]LB[qk:A]C[This move feels like it is too nice to white. He can settle easily now with the cut at A]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[pj];W[rl]
(;B[qg]LB[qc:B][ri:A]SQ[pj][qj][pk]C[this move i think is  another mistake of me what might be better ?

I agree. 
As A is open and B is available there are no points for black on this side. I think it is better to try and use the marked stones as thickness and build away from them.

See var];W[qc]C[I would call this premature but it is certainly playable. If I was white i would have first taken the key point at K16 and invited you to enclose this corner as I think doing so would be too slow for black.

Perhaps you did not choose the best joseki for this corner. The one you used really ends gote. Your sente was not really real. It left you a bit then.

Perhaps you could try one of the following?];B[pc];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[See vars];W[re];B[rf];W[pe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]
;B[nc];W[sd]LB[oe:B][of:A]C[One of these moves would be honte.
But i think you are right to tenuki as you will not be able to make enough points if you play this here.
You must be willing to accept the ensuing fights though.];B[fc]
;W[jc]C[Not sure I like this move as white. It gives black a good chance to create complications.
However with the Q15 aji around maybe it is ok.];B[fe];W[df]
;B[je]C[Nice.];W[ke]C[here is the question if my continuation is ok or if there is a better way to play?

You have an issue here which is Q15. If you had taken gote here and defended this cut you would be able to acctack severely and push white in to your thickness. However, here you are hesitant to do so as the aji will come alive.

This makes it very hard to attack these white stones.

I have shown some possible lines.]
(;B[jd]C[Normally this is quite a vulgar move, L14 is the shape. But as Q15 is so dangerous maybe this way is ok.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[lc];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[md]LB[oe:A]
[jf:B]C[This is an awkward position for black. You need both of these....]
;B[oe];W[hc];B[hb];W[jf];B[hd];W[if];B[gc];W[lg]C[At this point it is a very hard game for black.]

(;B[sb]C[this one i played because i was afraid of some ko ... see the sequence

Nice reading =)];W[rb];B[sf];W[sc];B[ch]C[Good. This is a must. You have to treat D14 as a weak group to stand a chance of getting back in the game]
;W[dh];B[di];W[cg];B[eh];W[dg]C[here is the question of how to continue again i think white could have done better if he pincer first after my connection

It is hard for white to attack your stones after you connect and D17 is very big and solid. I don't think it can be criticised much.

See variation of pincer];B[ci]
(;W[dc];B[cl];W[dr]
(;B[er];W[eq];B[fr];W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[hp];W[lo];B[lp];W[bm]
LB[eb:A][el:B][ml:F][fn:E][fo:C][ep:D]C[These are some of the points that stick out to me.

A is simply big and sente. No need to take it yet but make sure you get it!
B is solid and aims at CDE
F is not a move yet but if you get to play CDE this is a nice point soon after.]
;B[mf]C[here i felt very much behind so i thought a mybe ca attack this white group .. any better ideas or is white just to strong here?

Lets count!
White
Upper Left - ~20
Lower Left ~ 15 (bear in mind D1 hane is very big)
Right ~ 10 (assuming w gets S3)
Top Right ~ 5
Top ~ 5
Komi ~ 6?
= ~61

Black
Lower Side ~ 30
Left ~ 5
Upper Side ~ 12
Right ~ 10
=~ 57

So it is not a bad game really.

I have put some other idea down.];W[lf];B[eb];W[ff]C[I think this w move is a bit crazy, giving up all those points lets you back in to the game for real.]
;B[cb];W[bl];B[el]C[Nice];W[db];B[da];W[bc];B[fo]C[Very Nice]
;W[ep];B[fn];W[ko];B[kp];W[mo];B[np];W[hn]LB[ml:A][hm:B][in:C]
C[I feel this is complete overplay.
A move at A is tempting just to see what white does.

If you can't choose between B and C which does seem tough, then dont play either =)]

C[I think this move should be at D1 it will surely be sente and is almost enough to make up the final margin.

I'll stop here as the rest is mainly yose. Feel free to contact me on KGS if you feel i missed anything key or anything is unclear. Thanks.]

Bear in mind A is still open. and you took upper left corner away. So white has far fewer points than the game and C9 gains only a few.

So maybe the way you played in the game is ok given the situation.]

(;B[qb]C[This is my preferred choice.
The reason is that it feels like black is pushing white towards the R10 stones with this move which I think is logically correct.
Also the right side has little value so there is no reason to lock white in as you did in the game, it is more useful to be thick on the top.
But there is another reason i like this var in this particular game... see end of sequence]

[jc:C][gd:A][qh:D]C[Normally in this position black needs to play D to fix his shape. However, in this game the right side has very little value so I think you can tenuki here.
Sente is very big. Depending on your style you could choose any of the marked moves. (A,B,C)]

;W[qe];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]LB[sb:E][nc:A][rd:C][re:B][rf:D]
C[Probably white will play like this and you really need to defend at A so white will get the first move on the top.

Normally this would be fine but in this case the forcing sequence BCDE is of little value as the right side is small so I prefer the other variation shown.]

I'll put a couple of vars in to show possible continuations.]
