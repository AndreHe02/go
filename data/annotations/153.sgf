KM[5.5];VW[]B[dp]C[Commentary by Tero Sand, 4k*];W[pd];B[dc];W[de]C[A bit unusual, I think, but certainly not impossible.]
;B[qp]L[dh]C[I think 'a' is more usual; White is not likely to play in the last  open corner, and even if he does, the corners are split 2-2. Furthermore..  there's a feeling that it is better not to be burdened with a disadvantage  than to gain an advantage somewhere else.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dd]C[This  doesn't seem good to me; Black would need an existing position at the top for  the resulting shape to be meaningful.
For some alternatives, see variations B and C.];W[cd];B[ee];W[df];B[db]
L[fd]C[Slow though it may seem, I'd play 'a'.];W[lc]L[fd]C[This seems too  timid. 'a' would cause Black enough headaches.]
;B[ic];W[op]M[cc][cd][de][df]L[cn][qj][pj]C['a',  extending the marked group, is more appropriate. If, after the exchange comes  to an end, Black gets to play a shimari, 'b' or 'c' is just right.]
;B[pn];W[qq];B[pp]L[rq][pq][ro][kq]C[This is just bad  (unless there's a special reason); 'a'-'b'-'c'-'d', gaining sente, seems  good enough, locally.]
;W[pq];B[qj];W[cn]L[rp]C['a' seems  like the way to punish Black for his mistake. Now this group appears a bit  vulnerable.]
;B[ck]L[fq][mq]C[I would play 'a', followed  by 'b', perhaps.];W[cq]
L[cp][dq]C[Black has no good continuation. 'a' is too narrow,  while 'b' is totally useless.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[fq];B[dm]L[dn]C['a' is the way to secure the position.]
;W[ci]C[Already White seems to be leading. He has *much* more territory and  Black's positions are cramped.]
;B[qf];W[re];B[of];W[nd];B[kq];W[mq]L[rp]C[I would play 'a'; the corner territori is not small, and Black either loses  sente or leaves his moyo subject to more enroachment.]
;B[hq];W[bn]C[The time  for this is not yet, methinks.];B[ao];W[fp];B[dn]
;W[hp]L[ir]C[One has to  wonder "why?", since it strenthens Black. It seems that the base-robbing move  of 'a' is possible.]
;B[iq]L[ip][ko]C[Either 'a' or, even better, 'b' is  preferrable. One avoids the hane when it would help the opponent to form  shape/territory, but Black's group on the left means White can't derive any  advantage of a wall.]
;W[ip]C[I wonder what White thinks he is accomplishing  here.];B[jp];W[mo]
;B[jn];W[mm];B[gp];W[gq];B[go]C[And so the attack fizzles.  White does have some compensation; Black's right side moyo is rather weak.]
;W[ef]L[fd][pk][ql]C[Timid; any of the points 'a', 'b' or even 'c' seem  better. With this move White is helping Black to turn his moyo into  territory, and he can't get much territory in the center in return.]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[ol]L[ge]M[fe]C[Even though the right _is_ bigger, I feel bad about  not playing 'a'; danger is that the marked stone will be a wasted stone,  since the framework is still invadable.]
;W[ge]L[gd]C['a' is also  possible.];B[gd];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd];B[gc];W
[hf]L[he][hg]C['a' seems  better, stronger. If Black cuts, White 'b'.]
;B[id];W[oj];B[mk]
(;W[nh]L[qi]C['a' seems possible. See variation B for one possibility.]
;B[mf];W[lh];B[jh]L[mi][kf]C[It is very hard to decide what to do, but I would  play 'a' first, and then 'b'. This would give Black more connectivity, and  would still leave White a bit weak.

In my opinion, Black really has to aim for a largish center.];W[kg];B[jg]
;W[kf];B[ph];W[nk];B[ei];W[dj];B[ek]L[ej][kl]M[ck]C[Another idea is 'a' and to sacrifice the  marked stone, but even if Black gets sente to play 'b' or thereabouts the  resulting moyo looks too small - White's lead is quite big.]
;W[kl]M[mm][lh]L[jk]C[The game seems lost for Black  now. Btw, White could go even deeper, 'a' for example; the connection to  either of the marked stones seems guaranteed.]
;B[il];W[kj];B[ij];W[pk];B[qk];W[pl];B[ql];W[ej];B[fj];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh]
;B[fk];W[fo];B[gn]L[fn]C['a' is better.  And safe, yes.];W[rq];B[rp]
;W[sp];B[bi]M[sp]L[qm]C[Dangerous to ignore the  marked stone; 'a' captures. See variation B.]

(;W[bh];B[cj]L[bj][bg]C['a' would leave sente to Black (White has to prevent the clamp at 'b').]
;W[di];B[cb]L[bb]C[Okay, Black took sente anyway. :-) A good  decision, btw, but if he is to play here, 'a' seems more to the point, so to  speak.]
;W[bb]L[qm]C['a' is bigger.];B[lr];W[ro]L[qm]C[Uh, oh.. 'a'  is much, much better.]
;B[qn];W[ne]L[mr][rg]C['a' or 'b' is bigger.];B[nf]L[os]C['a' is bigger.]
;W[mr];B[rf];W[qe];B[ms];W[ns];B[ls];W[lq]L[nr]C[Better to connect humbly. See variation B.]

(;B[kr];W[or]L[nr]C['a' is better, this leaves extra ko threats, without any advantage.]
;B[se];W[sd];B[sf];W[rd];B[kb];W[lb];B[jb];W[rn]L[rm]C['a', going  deeper, is better.]
;B[rm];W[oh]L[pi]C['a' seems better; it's sente.];B[pg]L[la][gh]
[eq]C[This is unnecessary at this point. Bigger  points: 'a', 'b', 'c', for example.

Game record ends here. White wins by 15.5 points.])

Black can now tenuki, the drawback of which is that White can build a  position at the top with 'a'.
