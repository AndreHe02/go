C[Game submitted by Darrell Malick  (snip)
who played B, reviewed for the GTL
by Neil Mitchison (Niall 6k* on igs),
5.6.1998];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk];W[nc];B[pf];W[ic]C[NM: A little loose, but playable; I
would prefer K17.];B[fq];W[hq]C[NM: In the absence of a stone around D10,
this pincer is too close - J4 or K3 would
be better, because if B enters the
corner at C3, they work well with a W
response at D3.

(If there were a stone near D10, then
the correct W respoonse to C3 would
be C4 not D3).];B[fo]C[NM: Just for the reasons given
in the last comment, I would play
C3 here. Still F5 is not bad.];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ip]C[NM: After having played D2 (which
makes the F3 group heavy), I
think I would prefer  H5 to J4.];W[jq];B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[jp]C[NM: I think I would cut here straight
away (see variant).];W[kq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp];W[nq]C[NM: Good - at some point W must jump.]
;B[mq]C[NM: B is being too greedy if he thinks
he can cut here. There is one useful
piece of aji he could use (see variant
later), but I would be inclined to:   - play tenuki, or
 - play something like Q5 in order
    to hold in the W group while making
    territory, or
 - reinforce the F3 stones, e.g. with H4];W[mp];B[mr];W[nr]

(;B[lr]C[NM: There is aji here, but this is not
the way to exploit it (see variant).];W[kr];B[ks];W[jr];B[hp]
;W[gr]C[NM: This enables W to cut off the
D2 stone, but I think O4 is bigger.];B[mo];W[np];B[or];W[ms]
;B[po]C[NM: Good.];W[cj]C[NM: An excellent point.];B[em]C[NM: While this move does something to
reduce the potential W moyo (but if it
ever gets that big B has lost the game!)
and reinforces the B group, it strengthens
W too much on the side, and loses the
potential of the invasion at C8.
It is high time to attack the W moyo
 - I would play E16.  There are of
course often lots of ways to attack
a moyo, and other possibilities would be
F17 or D13.];W[dm];B[pb]C[NM: Large, because it also threatens
an invasion at M17. Still, the W moyo
is huge!];W[no];B[nm]C[NM: This move doesn't really gain B
anything - it daesn't hold in the W stones,
and it makes no territory.  Moreover there
are no weak B groups around which it
could reinforce.];W[el]C[NM: This move, on the other hand, does
help W by starting to make a moyo,  and threatening to confine B.  Still, it
is not as urgent as a play round M17
(which would also have an effect of
reinforcing the moyo).];B[kc]C[NM: Good!];W[kd];B[jd]C[NM: I would just have pulled back to
M17 in order to take the side without
reinforcing W's moyo above too much.];W[jc];B[ld];W[ke]
(;B[le]C[NM: Terrible! B must link.];W[lc];B[mc];W[kb];B[lb]
;W[kc]C[NM: As W, I would cut at N18 and fight
theko.  I have some good ko-threats, such
as G4 and Q4];B[nb];W[md];B[mb];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[ne];W[ed]
C[NM: Excellent! W has regained all he
lost from the invasion.];B[kf]C[NM: The key point for cutting, but
I would play keshi first - e.g. J10]
(;W[kg]C[NM: As W, I would have cut at K14 and turned my moyo into territory
(see variant).];B[jf];W[jg]C[NM: W is getting into an unnecessary
fight.];B[if];W[ie]C[NM: I don't see what this is meant to do
for W.];B[ig];W[je]C[NM: Pointless - loses the initiative in the
fight.];B[ih];W[lh];B[mh]C[NM: Not a good attacking move
- too close.  Something like O11 or K10
would be better.];W[mi];B[nh];W[ji];B[jh]C[NM: pointless, and reduces B's own
liberties.];W[kh];B[ii];W[jj];B[ij];W[jk];B[hl]C[NM: Good.]

C[NM: I think I would try a probe at D17
now, to try and use the aji of the
outside situation before it solidifies.];W[dh];B[di];W[ci];B[fg]

;W[nk];B[pj];W[ok];B[pm];W[gn];B[ho]C[NM: The cut is still dangerous (see variant
later) - F7 would be sounder.];W[gl];B[gk]
(;W[fl];B[ek];W[fi];B[gg];W[hf];B[gi];W[hg]C[NM: W seems to me to be ahead.

If both sides can hold their territory,

White has:
L side: 75
Bottom: 12
Centre: 11


Black has:

Top centre: 9
Bottom: 4
R side: 76

In fact, it seems to me that both are
invadable, at D17 and R4, and W would
lose more from a successful invasion
than B.  But W has better attacks
(e.g. O14, E4) against B than B against W
(although B3 is very big)])
(;W[ej];B[fl];W[fn];B[en];W[eo];B[fm];W[fp];B[go];W[gq]C[NM: and the BL corner dies ...]
))
(;W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh];W[jh]C[NM: The TL is beginning to look like W
territory. B has territory in the TR, but W
can easily invade his BR moyo (e.g. at P6).
Moreover the M14 stones still have some
aji, and if B doesn't play somewhere round
L10 there is a possible attack there.
W seems to me to be very comfortably
ahead.]))
(;B[lc];W[le];B[nd];W[ed]C[NM: The difference between this and
the sequence played is that K17 still
has some aji, which helps a reduction of
the moyo, e.g. by playing K13.]))
(;B[hr]C[NM: W cannot respond G2 or he'll lose
his K3 stones, so ...];W[jr];B[mo];W[np];B[hp]C[NM: And B's group is stable, with a good
wall towards the centre.  The drawback is
that W can enter the R side, e.g. at Q5.]))
(;B[jr]
(;W[kr];B[hr];W[js];B[hp];W[ko];B[lq];W[jp]C[NM: The B group on the L is stable,
while the W group is still weak, and B
can make territory on the R by attacking
it.])
(;W[hr];B[kq];W[hp];B[jp];W[hn]C[NM: Although B would prefer not to have
made the D2-C3 exchange (leaving
for example the aji of C3), he is clearly
in the stronger position.  He can now
either invade at C8 or make a moyo
somewhere round K8.])))
