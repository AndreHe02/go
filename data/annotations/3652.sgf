Degan:  Probably by the time you read this, you will already be 25k or better, you slaughtered your opponent.  Perhaps play this person again with less handicap.

I am tequila(black). At first, I do not have any "major" mistakes. But near the closing game, my opponent attacks 3 of my corners successfully. I had troubles dealing with them and it took me some time to think about them, but to no avail.

Degan: the 3-3 invasion is great to use (for white) in a handicap game.  White can always make some territory, unless black has a stronger presence in the corner.  The idea of putting the handicap stones at 4-4 means that the corners are not automatically black's, but give black more influence toward the center.  I will look at each of the invasions individually.

Hmmm, looking at your time settings it isn't clear that you could put much thought into any moves.  I don't know how worthwhile it is to review vary fast games.]

(;W[nm]TR[qn]C[Degan: This is an unusual start for white, I would expect the marked (r6) more often.  See variations.]
;B[pm]C[Is this a good way to protect my corner and side, or should i play R6 instead?

Degan: This really does little to protect your corner, it will not help (very much) against the 3-3 invasion. I think r6 would be better.  White can cut the connection between q4-q7.  However, q7 here does a good job of putting pressure on the o7 stone.  With this much handicap, you can afford to be a little agressive early - forcing white to look for life.  Variations showing 3-3 invasion.]

(;W[lk]C[Degan:  Interesting choice by white to try to start forming an area in the center to start.  Variation of 3-3 invasion.]
;B[mp]TR[li][nk][jl][lm]C[Degan:  Again, doesn't help too much with corner, and doesn't put too much pressure on the group white is making.  Keep the pressure on.]

;W[ln];B[oo];W[mo];B[cn]TR[lj][ok][jl][lo]C[should i continue to worry about the attacking of play else where, like this move?

Degan: White is not settled yet.  Your move communicates that you either think his group is alive (or dead), but that the situation is settled.  Urgent moves before big moves.  Keep the attack on white going, remembering to keep a surrounding shape.]

Degan: I think l3 (triangle) was an overplay, so it is a good idea to punish those.  Your other choice is to be more conservative and consolidate the corner.  I probably would have cross-cut like you.  Variation: Let's see what n3 would have done.]

I think k9 was a better play than k11 as the two black groups can be loosely connected nd supported by k12.  Variation with k11.]
