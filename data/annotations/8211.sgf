C[B:

Hello dear reviewer, this is a match I`ve played on KGS with quaite a long time setting so it was a rather serious match.
I`m playing black here and dispite the rank diference the match felt close to me until the very end. So i would like some general coments about  which moves were necesary and wich could of been left out, and about what issues  i need to focus during my study.
I`ve also added a few question regarding  particular positions.
Thankyou for your time

PS english is not my native language so please excuse any missspellings or gramar mistakes!

Hi Bogdan,

My name is Jan. I play on KGS PeatMan as 5k and I will be your reviewer. My comments are indicated by "J:".

My standard disclaimer: 
Bear in mind I'm only 5th kyu on KGS. That means that my comments may not always reflect the best advice, but it's the best I can give.

There's a summary at the end with what I see as the most important points.

Your English is understandable so it is good enough for me. :-)]

(;B[lc]LB[fe:1][cc:2][nc:3]C[here i thought that from F17 i can jump into the corner or if corner is closed i can jump into the middle so i chose to play a counter pincer in order to make a good extension from my hoshi.
Is this apropriate or is it a mistake ?

J:

1: The usual reaction to a pincer: jump.
2: You could, as alternative, take the corner.
3: The same idea as yours but more solid. (suggested by http://eidogo.com/ ) M17 leaves a weak spot at O17 and the corner is much better invadeable for white than with black O17. 
I wonder if N3 would also be a good idea: It claims the corner in a more solid way than M3 without beeing too thin and the room for extention for white towards the corner is pretty tight. The ideal extention would be at M17, but that would mean a contact play. 

M17 is probably a little too thin, as you will experience later in the game. (move 64)]

;W[dg];B[bg];W[ee];B[dc]C[J:

This move is not nescesary for the suvival of your corner group. It doesn't claim a lot of territory Therefore you can better do another larger move.
There are lots of choices considering the abundant open area. I'd say somewhere around K4.]
;W[eb];B[df]C[J:

As in the played sequence, you end up with a weak group. Alternatively you might sacrifice the stone and break through to the left center, (or treat is as a forcing move) but I think another move would gain more.

Just because you can atari doesn't mean you should. Think about the follow up.

(Looking at the continuation from this point you did fare pretty well, but that is because white made more mistakes than black.)]
;W[de];B[ef]C[J:

Given the situation I think sacrificing with D12 is better.
Here you just end up with a weak group.];W[ff];B[eg];W[dh];B[eh]
;W[dj];B[di]C[B:

I expected atari from E11 not C11
which of the two is the better option?]
(;W[ci]C[J: 

This is the best option for white, I think. The black E13 group is still weak. Weaker than your C11 group.

See the end of your proposed variations for comments.];B[ei]
;W[ck];B[ej];W[ek];B[dl]C[J:

Hmmm..... Why peep? 
Then again: treat it as a forcing move.];W[cl]C[J:

Why doesn't white just connect?];B[dm];W[cn]C[J;

Even now: Why doesn't white just connect?];B[dk]C[J:

Yes!];W[fl]C[J;

White should connect. 
Maybe pull the stone out later, but then again: It's just a stone..]
;B[cj]C[J;

Good: take.];W[bj];B[bi]TR[fl][ek]C[J:

No. Now you should connect.
Keep your stones connected when they are weak. Don't let him separate you.
You might do this move at B11 when you are connected, if you get the chance and if it is necessary.
In the mean time you can chase the marked white stones from two sides. It seems he wants to safe them.]
;W[dj];B[fe];W[ge];B[cj];W[dn]C[J:

White should make a bigger move.];B[bh]C[J:

Good. At least you are now connected.];W[jp];B[pj];W[qn]C[B:

here i was a bit surprised i expected o3 or maybe Q6 and an atempt to run back this seems to deep in my area
what could i`ve done about it ?

J:

I agree. Better would have been for white to play O3 or maybe better N3. This creates a weak group, getting chased around that might hurt the bottom and/or make the right top (more) solid.

Q6 is not so good in my opinion for the same reason.]
(;B[ql]C[J:

I would have preferred to attack from the corner.
See variation.];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo]
;W[nd]C[B:

and this again a bit overplayed maybe?

J:

Hmmm. I think not. This is a weak spot, as pointed out earlier. He should try to separate M17 from the corner.
but I would expect white to play around O3.]
(;B[le]C[J:

I think O17 is better: Try to keep your stones connected.

(The variation are continuations, possibly not the most correct ones.)]
;W[nf];B[lg]C[J:

Running out hurts your corner as you will see.];W[pe];B[qd]
;W[qe]
(;B[oe];W[pg]C[J:

Why not white P14 or P16?];B[of];W[og];B[ne];W[od];B[me]C[J:

Good idea. White is separated and not alive.
Maybe N16 was better, limiting the liberties of O16/P16.];W[rd]
(;B[oc]C[J:

I think blocking at S17 is better.
Keep him separated in two weak groups.];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb]
(;B[pf];W[qf];B[qg];W[rf];B[qh];W[nc]C[B:

i wanted to kill off the invasion and i needed that O17 point but couldn`t get it
i didn`t want to play it earlyer becous of the variation which enabled white to live... i think

so was  trying to kill allright so whould i just settled to defend as much  as i could?

J:

This or your variation (move 83) are both not so good for you.
 I think you went wrong earlier. See move 79 and variation.]
(;B[mc]C[J:

White has to react to this, but it is not nescesary for black right now so I wouldn't do it.
Invading as mentioned earlier seems better. Or descending with P3 might be wise first as a preparation for that. White has to defend his group, but you'll get a wall facing the lower center that you can more easily invade afterwards.]
;W[ob];B[nb];W[pb];B[ma]C[J:

And you end in sente if you want to protect that stone.];W[si]
;B[rj];W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[ph];W[jm]C[J:

Seems a little thin.. I would close the corner.]
(;B[fk]C[J:

This is just a stone. Leave it.];W[gk]C[J:

And white shouldn't bother too];B[el];W[fm]C[J:

Yes: close it.];B[gj]C[J:

There's a go-proverb saying: "Play away from strength."
This means you shouldn't play too near the opponents strength, but also not near your own strenght.
But this is just what you are doing now. Nobody can hurt the D11 group, so leave it as it is.
There are possibilities for invading that gain much more.];W[hk]
;B[hj];W[jk];B[ln]C[J: 

Now decend to P3?
White should react and you can invade the bottom better by treathening to connect]
;W[lq];B[nq];W[lm];B[kl]C[J:

This makes white stronger and your stone is immediately under attack or already lost.]
;W[km];B[jl];W[il];B[kk];W[jj];B[kj];W[ml]C[B:

at this point i begun to feel behind and looked for a quick end of the sequance in the middle in order to play san-san

as i was replaying the game on my own later i`ve added a san-san move earlyer..so the question remain about the timming .. when to play it?

J:

The sequence beginning at L8 gave him a chance to go into your territory. There were lots of chances earlier to invade.]
;B[ji];W[mn];B[mo];W[lo];B[nn];W[nm]C[J:

Hmm. White should just connect.];B[mm];W[nl];B[ll];W[mn];B[cm]
;W[bm];B[mm];W[ki];B[mn];W[lj]C[B:

big mistake here];B[nh]C[J:

Probably wise to secure these stones.];W[cq]C[J:

Good idea by white. Other moves that would prevent san-san invasion are D3 or E3.]
;B[im];W[jn];B[hl]C[J:

What were your plans? 
If white just captures you'll find the played stones are  completely lost.]
;W[lk];B[jh];W[if]C[B:

and i think now black might just as well abandon
 i`ve still carried out the match
so if you have any comments about the endgame please fell free to make them]
;B[gq]C[B:

also this invasion was just a desperate act ...which succeded but i don`t think is my own merit more like some mistakes form my oponent helped out a lot]
;W[er];B[fr];W[hr];B[iq];W[gr];B[fq];W[fs];B[hq];W[hm]C[J:

Mistake: Not nescesary. Attack the black bottom stones.];B[ir]
C[J:

Good: Ignore.];W[gs];B[eq];W[dr];B[go];W[lr];B[kr];W[lp];B[jq]
;W[js];B[ks];W[kq];B[is]C[J:

That's one eye...];W[ip];B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[ep];B[gm];W[gl]
;B[fp]
(;W[gn]C[J:

Another mistake by white.];B[hp]C[J:

Yes!];W[db]C[J:

Nice. You reduced him quite a lot by beeing able to make live group at the bottom.
White shouldn't have let that happen.];B[cb];W[ca];B[ba];W[da]
;B[ab];W[kb];B[dq];W[cr];B[cp];W[bp];B[do];W[co];B[bn];W[bo]

White is kind to black. :-)

J:

A summary:

- Play away from strength. 
  When you have a live group with not much potential
  for development: leave it. Make another move.
  (move 21, 101, 105 and probably some more moves)
  
  More on playing away from strength:
  http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayAwayFromThickness
  (also compare the last example with move 7.)

- Always think about how to proceed after a move. 
   Don't do an atari or a peep just because you can.
   You might do this but only when you can leave the 
   stone just like that and the reaction of your opponent
   doesn't make him stronger. (a 'forcing move')

   More about forcing moves:

   You may also want to check out:
   http://senseis.xmp.net/?ForcingMoveMisunderstandings
   (Seems nice stuff. I have to check this out myself too.)

- Don't be too greedy. Make stronger positions and 
  don't overextend. (move 7)

- Don't bother about just one stone. There might be
   better moves elsewhere.])
