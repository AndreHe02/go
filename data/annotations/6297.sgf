C[als111 [18k?\]: Good luck
elconde [18k?\]: hello

Hi, my name is Marco and I will review your game for Black.
Since you didn't ask any specific questions, I will just pick out some moves where you could have played a better move.
I will try to focus more on the general rules then on loads of variations.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[fq];B[pd];W[qf];B[je]C[Here, White attacks your corner.

Of course you can defend your corner by playing at O16/O17.

You chose to extend on the side, which is fine, but you should have played at K16 then. Now White can easily take the top side, by playing at K17, because your move was too high (5th line)

General rule: in the opening play on 3rd line or 4th line mostly.]
;W[nc];B[eq]C[Here, White played a double approach move against your top right corner. If you don't respond, White can seal your corner in by playing at P15; this would be a good result for White. So defending your corner is quite urgent

Instead, you touched his approaching stone. This made his stone stronger. He can extend to F4, then you have to defend the corner, then White can make in ideal extension to K4.

General rule: Don't touch weak stones.

Exception: When you have a stone on K4 yourself, then it is ok, because White can't make his ideal extension.]
;W[fp];B[dj]C[White can seal in your corner now, by playing at D5 (See variation).
You have to defend at C6/D6.]
(;W[cq];B[do]C[This is too easy for White, because he can connect.
Play at e2 to prevent White from connecting.
After that you can play around J3 and attack his 2 stones.]
;W[er];B[jj]TR[oe][pf][qk][qn][kq][nq]C[This is too early.

General rule:
In the opening we start in the corner, then the side, then we go into the center.

I marked some of the big moves.
So a better move would be bottomside, leftside, or approach White's bottomright corner. And of course your top right corner]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[jb];B[ic];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc]
(;B[gc]C[General rule: if you cannot catch a stone, don't atari.

In  this case extend to G18 is better, because then you would be strong and his stone weak.
After the atari he becomes stronger, and you are weak, because of the cutting point at G18.
See variation.];W[hd];B[kd];W[gb];B[fb];W[ga];B[fa]C[Don't force him to take your stone.
Instead you can ignore his move or connect at F17.];W[ha];B[lc]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[ka];B[fc];W[kc];B[ia]TR[oe][pf][qk][qn][kq][nq]
C[You don't have to fight this ko now.
There are points on the board which are much bigger than this ko.]
;W[ja];B[kb];W[mc];B[md];W[kc];B[dr];W[dq];B[kb];W[nd];B[mj]
C[This is move is too high again.
Also pay attention to your stone on Q16. It has just become weaker, because White played at O16. So it getting even more urgent to come out.]
;W[oj];B[ok]C[White move is too high, you can punish him by going under his stone and play at R10.]
;W[ie];B[jf];W[if];B[ig];W[jg];B[kg];W[hg];B[jh];W[ih];B[ii]
;W[jg];B[fr]C[Again, you shouldn't fight this ko.
locally, just connecting here is the best, I think.];W[ep];B[ig]
;W[hh];B[jg];W[fg];B[jn];W[jp];B[dg];W[ed];B[ec];W[ee];B[de]
;W[fd];B[gd]TR[pf][pj][qn][nq]C[This move is small, it doesn't cut White, so play a bigger move (defend corner, approach corner).]
;W[ge];B[ef];W[fe];B[pm];W[dc];B[db];W[cc];B[cb];W[ea];B[eb]
;W[bb];B[bc];W[cd];B[ba];W[bd];B[ab];W[gj];B[gk];W[hi];B[hj]
;W[hk];B[gi]C[Connecting at J10 is necessary.];W[ij];B[ik];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[jk];B[ii];W[il];B[fj];W[hj];B[pf];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd]

;B[oi];W[pi];B[pj];W[qj];B[pk];W[oh];B[nj];W[ni];B[nh];W[oj]
;B[op];W[oq];B[oi];W[ph];B[mi];W[me];B[le]C[White has a double ko here (as you noticed in the game), so you really need to defend here.]
;W[ld];B[nq];W[np];B[md];W[kc];B[pq];W[oo];B[kb];W[ld];B[or]
;W[op];B[md]TR[qq][qr]C[You need to take the bottomright corner now.
A move at R2 for instance would be big.];W[kc];B[jd];W[pr];B[hn]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[ei];B[di];W[ej];B[fl];W[ek];B[dl]TR[cl]C[C8 is better, now White can break through.]

;W[gp];B[ho];W[mm];B[mn];W[nm];B[om]TR[on]C[Now White can cut off your Black group.
Locally, a move at P6 would be best, because you would connect your stones.]
