;W[dd]C[Hi, 

This is Jenson. I'm selected as the reviewer for this game, I'm also still learning to improve my game, I shall now try my very best to give my comments as details and straight-to-the-point as I can. 

Due to my heavy schedule at work, I couldn't afford to review most of the games assigned to me. Thus, this time round I hope I can come out with a review for you despite my tight schedule. Stay tuned and have fun! =)

(;B[cn]MA[cj][ck][cl][cm][dn][do][ep][fp][gp][hp][ip]C[This move is not urgent right now, though white's next move might invade black's territory as what has White responded next.

Why so? Black is relatively strong on the right, there would be no worry for Black to respond properly when white invades.

Black can try playing somewhere which can further extend the territory, though Black's 29 futher secure the bottom left corner.]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[eq]
(;B[hq]C[I think Black should play at the other site, try to push White play towards your strong site and kill their groups without mercy.]
;W[cq]SQ[cn]C[Now the door is wide open for White to invade.

Obviously, Black's C6 lead to such failure and successful invasion.]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[dq];B[ep];W[er];B[bp];W[bq];B[pg]C[Try to play further up, Q14 and R14, or R13 would be better moves.]
;W[nc];B[qe]C[This move only help white to strengthen the ties and build up his territory from the border to the corner, a very huge camp they have there.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[re];B[rf];W[rd];B[me];W[md];B[jf]C[Too much, K15should be sufficient.]
;W[rl]C[Black "steal" the chance from Black to block there.]

;W[ll];B[mn];W[kj];B[ji];W[mj];B[nl];W[nk];B[ol];W[nj]
(;B[cd];W[lk]C[hmm, White is trying to make a living group and ignoring his corner. Btw, although Black took some advantages there, but too close to White 4 is not that good too. Playing 113 at B14 is still preferable.]
;B[nh]LB[li:A]C[Since White will seal of the open port, Black should play at point "A" first then just follow by Black 115, it would be a better sequence.]

;W[jh];B[ih];W[ii]C[Now you can see that you made a greater loss here with White getting a bigger gain.]

;B[tt]C[Well, if you have realised some mistake made earlier, you would have a better results, but overall, Black still play better than White, and Black missed quite a number of good chances to make White resign before having the needs to come to the end.

Enjoy!

(;B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[ap];B[en]C[Even though this move was made, though unnecessary right now, but just for illustration and better secure your group, this outcome is far better than the actual proceeding of game.

This traps White group in the corner and prevent it from branching out and further strengthen the Black outside, from the board, it's clear that Black is at advantage.]

(;B[dq]TR[cn]C[Playing here protect the corner, since you have previously played at C6 (the triangle marked stone), it would be a waste if you give up your corner. If it is to be, then your C6 is a wasted move lead to failures later on, which is white successfull invasion, and gain of territory, and other unforseen threats buried across the region.]

(;B[qf]C[Black can try playing here instead of the actual Black 29.]

;B[rd]C[Black can then further extend to this point.];W[qc]
C[White should respond. After this Black has plenty of good points can try to play around with White, which will either end up in building big moyo and influence for Black, and minimum territory for White to the right of the board, which you would be able to imagine the moves in your head ;)]

(;B[rj]C[Black can try here too.])
(;B[qi]C[Try here, or ...])
(;B[rl]MA[qi]C[Here is  good point too, but leave spaces for White to invade later somewhere around the "x" marks. When the opportunities come by.]
