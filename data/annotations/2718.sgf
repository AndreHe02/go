;B[kn]C[White starts building a wall that I can't break into.  I have trouble in these situations because I don't know how to play stones into opponent territory or cutting points without getting trapped.

You should not be worried about White making a wall here.  If you continue with the wall the way it's going, you should be very happy.  The huge area you are staking out above the wall is MUCH larger than White's area below.  This is not a situation where you want to think about jumping into White's territory.  You can still invade the lower left corner later on.]
;W[jn];B[ff];W[df];B[ed];W[dd];B[ee]C[This is another example of the trouble I have with cutting.  White builds a solid wall because I didn't play close enough for a successful cut.

You should not be jealous of your opponent's territory.  You sound like you want to destroy all of his territory.  You don't need to, all you have to do is make sure you have more than he does.  If you can solidify the territory you have already staked out, there is no way White can win.  The last few moves you made were good, because you are making your area larger and stronger, and White is just reinforcing what he already had.]
;W[de];B[fh]LB[ec:A][jm:B]C[At this point, I would be thinking about either A or B.  This move is okay, but I would prefer one of those.]

C[White's wall is pretty strong now but I made a few cutting points I thought would be useful later on.  However, as it turns out my cuts failed.

This actually is going very well for you.  The cutting point you made here should allow you to keep sente, and you are still making tons of influence towards the center.]
;W[jm]C[This is what I was worried about earlier.  You really don't want White to get in and mess up your center territory.]

(;B[km]LB[ll:A]TR[kn][ln]C[White wants to mess up your territory.  I might try messing up his instead of this move.  See variation.

Even if you are going to respond to White directly, this is not the move you want to make.  My first thought would be to play at A.  The move you made is bad shape.  The three marked stones make what is called an "empty triangle".]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[lj]C[Now white starts to squeeze my wall into a smaller group.  43 was an attempt to get around this and connect to my group on the left.

This is where things start to really fall apart.  You just have too many weaknesses in this area.  I think one of the problems here is that you are playing to close to the white stones.]
;W[lk];B[mk]LB[mn:A]C[This is a big mistake.  See variation at A.]

(;W[ml];B[mm];W[lm]
(;B[mn]C[Things look bleak for me as a kou battle starts

It should have been much worse for you.  I would consider this a small victory :)

You should not have saved the three stones that were in atari, I would have defended instead.  See variation.]
;W[nl];B[ll]C[I don't think you can win this ko.  White doesn't have too many weaknesses where you can make ko threats, and you have a lot.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[lm];B[mi]LB[ol:A]C[I probably would have played at A.]

;W[mh];B[ll]LB[jj:A]C[A double atari with 64 breaks up and weakens my group further.  I let 43 live because I liked the idea of it being able to connect at the left and it has the possibility of threatening white's outer wall.  This works out in my favor later on.

You should probably play at A before capturing in the ko fight, and then you would probably win it.

White's group in the center is cut off.  You should be attacking them instead of fighting this ko.  The way to start is to make your isolated stones in the center stronger.]
;W[ki];B[jj];W[lm];B[oj]LB[oi:A]C[A is a much better move here.]
;W[oi];B[ll]C[I continue trying to win the kou battle by eventually capturing the group at O8.]

;W[qj];B[qk]C[91 seemed like the only good play here.  It keeps white from connecting by threatening the lone stone 87.

It was the only move.];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj]LB[mg:A]C[This is a wasted move by White.  You should take advantage of sente to make your territory in the upper right safer.  A seems like a really good idea.]
;B[qn]C[I don't think you need to worry too much about these stones.  This is probably a wasted move at this point.]

(;B[rm]C[Do you see what White was trying here?  See variation.]
;W[pr];B[qr]C[My cut with 101 pays off and I save my group.

Yes, and White foolishly gives up sente for 4 points.];W[ps]
;B[qs];W[os];B[qq]C[Oops, you just gave it back.  This move is unnecessary.]
;W[mg]C[This is a big move, and it's going to cost you a lot.]

;W[ig];B[gg];W[ih]LB[kg:A]C[I think at this point, I would play at A.  The white group has to make two eyes in the square, and if he screws up, you gain about 40 points.]

;B[qd];W[pb];B[rb];W[lb];B[mc]C[White resigns and disconnects from the internet.  It seems like a lot more could have been done by both sides and that the game was far from over.

White was right to resign.  He is behind by about 50 points, because the white group in the middle is dead.The only big think that is left to do is for you to invade the lower left corner.  The standard sequence is played out after this move.

Your game looks spotty - parts were very good, and parts need some work.  Your opening was fantastic, and you had a HUGE lead early on.  If you would have just kept White out of the center, the game would have been over very quickly.  When you were trying to limit White's damage to your territory, you consistently played too close to his stones.  If you played a little farther away, it would have been a lot easier to stop him.  Your endgame needs a lot of work, too.  Towards the end of the game it becomes very important to always play the biggest move that remains on the board.  Try to keep that in mind when you're deciding what to do.]
