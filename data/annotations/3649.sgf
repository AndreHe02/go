C[[PL\] My name is Peter Leyssens, I'm currently 3k on KGS, and I will review this game for fuseki for both sides, as you requested, and hint at possible tesuji when applicable.  All my comments will start with [PL\] like this one.]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp]TR[cq][qq]C[[PL\] Both sides are equal now.  W is playing very influential (B can invade both corners at the triangles when needed).  B is playing a compromise between influence and territory.]
;B[ce]TR[oc]C[lately im playing strictly territorial.

[PL\] This is a very good move.  Much better than the other shimari (triangle).]
;W[oc];B[mc]LB[kc:A]TR[dc][ce]C[[PL\] This is the reason why your shimari on the left (triangled) is so good: an extension from a shimari is always strongest if it points away, like an extension from a wall.  So this move, is now a very good extension and a pincer.  W can later play around 'A', but that's not a problem right now.]
;W[qf];B[od];W[qi]LB[nd:A]C[[PL\] This move is a matter of taste.  W could also play 'A' and be agressive.  But he can also leave 'A' for later.]

(;B[qm]C[i play at r7 so that a white pincer won't work so effectively with the stones at the right side.

[PL\] The disadvantage is, that you can also not extend.  See variations to this move.  Looking at the rest of the game, you will see that this move isn't doing anything, except helping W.  So this move is not good.]
;W[qo];B[nq]LB[qk:A]TR[qm]C[is this right? i was thinking of restraining white's corner development.

[PL\] Because of your triangled move, W can now easily attack it.  For example, 'A' would be irritating for B: W is strong above and below, and you can only run.  See the variation to the next move.]

(;W[oq]TR[qm]C[[PL\] W clearly wants security.  Your triangled stone is still weak.]
;B[np]C[[PL\] Yes, very important.]
(;W[cj]C[[PL\] A big move, but the principle is: first urgent moves, then big moves.]
;B[jq]LB[fq:B][gq:A]C[[PL\] Yes, very important move.  This is a very good example of an urgent move.  Playing on the 4th line is also possible, and you may have the chance to extend to 'A' or 'B' (these extension works better from the 4th line than from the 3rd line).]
;W[gq]LB[cq:A]C[[PL\] This move is okay.  If you want to play territorially, you should now invade at 'A'.  'A' is a good move.]
;B[jd]LB[cq:A]C[i feel so slow.

[PL\] This is actually quite a big move.  But I think 'A' is bigger.]
;W[cg];B[bo]LB[bp:B][cp:C][cq:A][dq:D]C[i didn't mind playing this low because i felt i could handle white's influence after the sequence.

[PL\] Yes, your thinking is right.  This area is the best place to play now: if W can turn this all into territory, B lost.  So B must invade.  Except for 'A', 'B' is also a possibility.  Or 'C' or 'D' if you like it complicated ;-)]
;W[bq]LB[gd:B][pm:A]TR[oc]C[i didn't expect this territorial move and timid. should white play for influence?

[PL\] Playing for influence would be good for W now.  After building up influence on the left, W can play e.g. 'A' and his position will be good.

[PL\] Possibly W believes that with the 2 bottom corners and the 2 groups alive on the left&right, he can win.  But the B top side is now quite big, so he must also invade (around 'B') or use the aji of the triangled stone.  This move turns W's slight advantage into a slight disadvantage, though 'A' is still a very nasty move.]
;B[dn]C[so i play to the center inmediately.

[PL\] Yes, good thinking.  Another principle is what an 8 dan pro from China once told me: first connect, then make life, then attack.  Running to the center, as you do here, is indeed most important.  Just living on the side would be very small, and W can still make influence.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[do];B[cm];W[dm];B[en];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]
(;B[gc]TR[qm]C[[PL\] If you want to defend the top, this is okay.  But the triangled stone is still extremely weak.  So check the variation.]
;W[qk]
(;B[qn]LB[om:A]C[i  think i play this move to treathen to invade at r3 and if he defend i got to the center.

[PL\] Invading at R3 now is very difficult, because W already defended his corner twice.  Playing at 'A' yourself gives W less possibility to attack.  see variation.]

(;W[ro]C[[PL\] W is kind :-)];B[on]C[[PL\] Yes, now B has very little problems.  W made the mistake of not cutting you, so now you must indeed run out immediately.]
;W[ok]
(;B[nl]LB[of:A]C[[PL\] This move is okay, but 'A' was also interesting.  See variation.]
;W[nm]C[[PL\] The next sequence is weak play by W.];B[om];W[ol]
;B[mm];W[nk];B[ml];W[mj]LB[of:A]C[[PL\] Very small move.  'A' was much bigger !]
;B[of]C[[PL\] Yes :-)];W[eg]
(;B[fl]LB[gn:A]C[trying to avoid W expansion to the center.

[PL\] No, there's another reason why you should play here.  W is strengthening his left top.  So that means that your left group becomes weaker.  So you must also reinforce.  This is not the best place, though: just 'A' was okay.  Or maybe you can take a look at the variation for another idea.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[gm];B[fj]C[[PL\] Hmmm, risky.  W has split you, and now you have a new weak group.]
;W[em];B[fp];W[fq];B[ep];W[eq];B[ho]LB[hg:A]TR[fj][fl]C[trying to connect this stones with the group at the right and to damage W center.

[PL\] W doesn't have a center there.  If W wants the center, he'll play 'A' and try to capture your 2 triangled stones.  But this move is necessary to connect, because on the left side, you have limited eye space.]
;W[lo]C[[PL\] W is playing more agressive than in the beginning of the game, and he's right, because he's behind.]
;B[nn];W[jn];B[lq]LB[im:A][ip:B]TR[fj][fl]C[i think i'm playing very greedy

[PL\] If you want to play more agressive, you can play 'A'.  W must run after that move, and you can run with him, saving the 2 triangled stones.  This move isn't very greedy, it's a bit slow.  And W can cut at 'B'.]
;W[im];B[hj]C[now im concern about this center group

[PL\] I've been concerned about this group for a long time :-)  W's previous move wasn't very active: just a simple defense.  That's why you now also have the chance to defend.]
;W[kk]LB[hg:A]C[[PL\] Another slow move by W.  'A' is still better.]
;B[gh];W[me];B[pc];W[nd]
(;B[oe]C[[PL\] This way, W can cut you.]
(;W[mg]C[[PL\] *oh* surprise !  W is very scared here.]
(;B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[hf]TR[fe][ge][he][ie][ff][jf]C[[PL\] Yes, a good attack.  B will probably live, but then W will become strong on the outside (triangled area) and he can invade the top.]

(;B[ih]C[making shape

[PL\] Yes, okay, but a bit slow.];W[jf];B[jj]
(;W[kj];B[ji]C[now im more relaxed with this group

[PL\] I don't think it's entirely safe yet...];W[kh];B[ki];W[li]
;B[gg]LB[gf:A]C[[PL\] The one-point jump at 'A' is much better shape than this move !]
;W[gf];B[fg];W[ff];B[eh]
(;W[df];B[dh];W[ch];B[di]
(;W[ci]C[[PL\] B's play is slow, but fortunately for him, W isn't agressive at all.  W should attack harder.  And B should defend harder, too :-)]
;B[eo]C[[PL\] I don't understand this move.  B takes away a liberty from himself, and he isn't threatening too much.  What about this move next ?]

(;W[gk];B[fk];W[gl];B[gj];W[ip]C[[PL\] Yes, the cut that I mentioned before.  Sometimes W plays very good moves, but then he follows them up with weak play that stops him from achieving the goal he wanted.]
;B[go]TR[eo]C[[PL\] Because B took his own liberty with the triangled move, he must now defend.]
;W[io];B[iq];W[hp];B[md]C[[PL\] Yes, good defense of the top.]
;W[ne];B[qg]LB[pg:A]C[trying to make some damage here...is this the correct way?

[PL\] Yes, though you cannot expect to do too much damage.  But compared to if W played 'A' before you played here, it's a very big difference.]
;W[rg];B[pg];W[qh];B[cp];W[dq];B[cq];W[cr]TR[eo]C[[PL\] This was the threat you had in mind when you played the triangled move, but as you can see: the damage is very limited.  The disadvantage in the center was much bigger.  So the triangled move cost you points.]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[ej]
(;W[cf]C[[PL\] W is being friendly again.  He is forcing you to defend.]

(;B[cd];W[bf]C[[PL\] W is being friendly again :-)];B[be];W[bk]
;B[bl];W[al];B[bn]C[this left group was my downfall. i didnt notice that c6 was a false eye much later. i should have play a7 and finish with this side.]
;W[bj];B[op]LB[am:A]C[[PL\] I think a defensive move at 'A' is important :-)]
;W[or];B[nr];W[pq];B[id]C[i play here because i was afraid that W could attach to L16 and with the possible cut at N18 could have made some troble for me.

[PL\] You are right, as I have shown in the variation before.]
;W[oh]LB[re:A]C[Rather small.  'A' would've been better, for example.]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[hr]C[[PL\] Big point.];W[gr];B[re]C[[PL\] Yes, this is very big endgame.  Also for W, so it's actually double-big: big for W and big for B.  That makes it one of the biggest moves on the board.]
;W[og];B[pf];W[rf];B[qe];W[am]C[see...i should have play here. is there a way i could have save this group?

[PL\] By defending in time :(  Now it's dead.  A4 & A6 are miai for the 2nd eye.]

Black: 72 territories + 2 prisoners = 74
Result: W+35.5

[PL\] B's main problem was that he didn't watch out for weak groups.  For example, the single stone on the right has been laying around for a long time.  It should've been extended to the center much sooner.  Also, the center group (triangles) has been left for too long.  Thirdly, the group on the left had a false eye and wasn't defended soon enough.  The move at 'A' helped white, and then forgetting to defend allowed W to kill the group.

So if you take more care about making groups run away, and defending them in time, you will improve quite a bit.

W's main problem was that, while playing very good moves from time to time, the sequences of moves after a very good move was usually slow and not severe enough.  W had many chances to attack B's groups, but either didn't do it, or in a way that gave B the chance to live.  So practice a bit in playing more agressively and you can improve.  The book "Tesuji" may help you both.  Also for W, sacrificing can be an interesting way to attack: remember that not every one of your stones must live.  Sacrifice 1, 2 or 3 and kill the opponent.
