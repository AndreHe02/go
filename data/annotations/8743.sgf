C[In this game I tried to play more on influence and not so much on territory, but I obviously handled the invasion at move 82 wrong.
If there are any mistakes or things to point out, please do.
After move 170 it's going down the hill, so no need to comment too much on that :-)

Hi, my name is Miron Brezuleanu. I will review the game for black, marking my comments with "MB". Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.]

(;B[gc]C[MB I believe it would have been better to play this at D4 if you were aiming for influence. See variation.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dd];B[ce];W[cb];B[fe]C[is this ok? I wanted to keep my stones (sort of) connected and wanted to keep white confined in the corner]
;W[bb];B[qn]C[MB: again, this would be better at D4. If you play in this area and go for influence, an alternative would have been Q6.]
;W[nc];B[lc];W[qf];B[oe];W[rd];B[qc];W[ne]
(;B[nf]C[MB: the O17 O15 stones are the weaker stones here, because of the M17 black stone. You should have tried to attack them on a large scale, not strengthen them by playing against them. See variation.]
;W[ld]
(;B[md];W[mc];B[me];W[kc]C[MB: Nooo, the white group is now settled, strong and you gained nothing. See possible variation at move 25; the white group is still under some pressure at the end, and you stand to make some points on the upper edge. Better result IMHO.]

;W[ng];B[mg];W[mi];B[li]C[MB: Not really necessary. The white stone threatens nothing and is alone against a huge black wall. Better to have played this at D4.]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[ep];B[lj]C[MB: Again, the white stones are cutting two strong black groups. They are not worth the stone spent capturing them.]
;W[il]C[how to handle this?

MB: After white E4, your wall lost much of its value. I would try to attack the L17 white group, which still doesn't have eyes. It looks like J18 is a vital point for that group. Right now the J8 stone can escape to two sides, or can connect to the L17 group. Very difficult to attack with a profit.]
(;B[cn]C[i think this lost me the game, is that correct?

MB: this game was lost in more moves :-) Right now, I would focus on the L17 group. In this area, something along the lines of E6 might have been better. Again, the J8 stone has so many directions to escape it's hard to figure out an attack.]
;W[cj]
(;B[en];W[cg]
(;B[go]C[MB: this move does very little. Your variation attacking the C10 group is better.]
;W[gq];B[di];W[ci]C[MB: it looks like E10 was better here.]
;B[dh];W[dj];B[ch];W[fj];B[fp]C[MB: this only helps white strengthen. Terrible.]
;W[fq];B[eo];W[dp]
(;B[gm]C[MB: this is too safe at this time. If you are to get back in the game, you need to be more aggressive. See variation]
;W[ip];B[io];W[gl];B[fl];W[gk];B[ek]C[MB: this only helps white connect. What about C8 instead, limiting white's base?]

C[MB: I don't see what this accomplishes. The vital point on the upper side is J18, depriving the L17 group of eyes.]

(;B[jr]C[MB: Some attempt to prepare for J18 by playing J16 first (giving the impression the purpose is to seal in the L17 stones and make some points in the center) would have been better. The black center is toast, and white has too many points on the rest of the table. No further comments.
