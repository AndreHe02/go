C[>Hello, and thanks for reviewing my game.
>I play white in this game against Norwegian, Thomas Vasdal(1kyu).

>Some history:
>This game was just played in the Norway Championship(NM).
>I'm ranked as a 3kyu Norway, 2kyu KGS, 1kyu GTL.
>After wining my first two matches I got matched with Thomas Vasdal, ranked 1kyu in Norway, >because of a loss in one of his prior games.

>Time: 60min - 15min/5stones, for each player.

>The game goes very bad for me, and I can understand if it is somewhat hard to review this game.

>I will add notes where I have questions, and somewhat explain what my thoughts was in the game.
>Please feel free to add any comments on moves where I do not have a question.

Hi Christoffer
I will try my best to explain your mistakes];B[dp];W[pq];B[pc]
;W[cd]LB[fc:C][pe:A][qe:B]C[>Note: Not sure if I should directly approach at A or B. Don't like that I'm inviting black to play on the biggest side of the board.

Your last move wasn't a mistake. It can lead to miai B-C.];B[pn]
LB[pe:B][qe:A]C[> How to approach?

It's 1 to 1 in BR corner and B didn't make shimari in the TR corner so approaching his stone with A looks normal. You should notice that in this kind of fuski it is hard to build big moyo, so you should play A instead of B to limit B's territory.]
;W[pe]LB[qe:D][qg:E][qo:B][np:A][pq:C][qq:F]C[>Note: Don't like giving black a mojo, thought of miai of A/B if black approach corner, the "C" stone looks "loose" so I decided to play elsewhere.
>Since I do not know any joseki for the lower right corner, I hoped to involve it with some fighting.

>What to do?

B has many choices here. D,E,F all look like decent options]
;B[qg];W[qc]C[> Decent move?

It's ok in this stuation]
(;B[qb]C[>Note: Not the joseki I was hoping for.

Pretty reasonable move, it's a territorial type of game];W[qd]
;B[mc]
(;W[qi]LB[pn:A]TR[qc][qd][pe]C[>Looks like an overplay.
>But I find the variations to be lacking.
>Am I wrong? Better answers?

It's an overplay.Your stones are not settled yet, but you invaded and made another weak group.]
;B[og];W[ql]
(;B[op]C[Not the best approach];W[oq];B[np];W[ne]LB[rb:A]C[>"A" first?

Your move is ok, moving out is important];B[rb]
(;W[le]LB[oi:A][rn:B]TR[qi][ql]C[>"A" instead? Marked stones really starting to look weak.

Again, you couldn't skip that move. But there was some options
Also, your stones on the side are not that week, you have A and suberi B  for easy living.]
;B[nq];W[qo];B[qn]
(;W[qp]C[>Better variation?

Your move was too defencive.];B[pk]
(;W[qk]C[>Here I missread, ( see variation )

This move is a mistake.];B[pi]

Not the worst result for W. A has very big aji. B and C are miai]
;B[jp];W[cn]LB[fq:A]C[>Was thinking of A, but seems like an overplay.
>Any thoughts?

A is an overplay. The game is still not over for w];B[dn];W[dm]
;B[en]
(;W[cq]LB[dq:A]C[>The standard joseki variation looked to good for black, had to try another variation.
>Thought of A, but did not know the variation.

It's an old variation and looks unreasonable]
(;B[cp]C[This look like mistake];W[dq];B[eq]
(;W[bp];B[co]C[>Black mistake.

Very strange shape by B];W[bo];B[ep];W[cm];B[fl]LB[ok:A]C[>Against, black looks huge.

Not really. W can reduce his moyo using A]
(;W[kc]LB[nb:A][og:B]C[>Aiming at A, when I studied the shape, black had no stone at B, mistake by me.]

Your A was a big overplay];B[pf];W[nf];B[ic];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc]

;B[pa]C[>I resigned here.

You made too many weak groups that hard to handle in the beggining, that's too much. Just play something that would be easy for you, don't start a fight where you are at disadvantage.

Try solving fuseki and chuban problems, and don't skip urgent moves

Hope my review will help you.
Thank you.])
