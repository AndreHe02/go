C[Mongoose11 [5k\]: hey, have a good game

Hello Mongoose I'm Arne about 1k, or was since I have not played for a long time. But I'll give it my best.]
;B[pd]C[hiroshima [5k\]: Hi  enjoy the game];W[dc];B[qp]C[Mongoose11 [5k\]: I've never seen advice on fuseki that don't start parallel, so I just avoided the cross placement.]
;W[oq];B[oo]C[This seems not good]
(;W[qn]C[Arne: Think this is an overplay.]
(;B[op]
(;W[pq];B[qo]C[Mongoose11 [5k\]: I don't know any joseki from herem but dividing him like this seemed to work out well]

C[Mongoose11 [5k\]: would have given as many nobi as he wanted at first line. I am very happy.

Arne: OF COURSE, LET HIM CRAWL ;)];W[qq]
(;B[dp]LB[jr:A][ql:B]C[Arne: but this is not so good. Due to the open side at A.
It's better to attack here at B.]
(;W[gq]C[Arne: Overplay];B[jr];W[cn]C[Arne: And another overplay]
(;B[eq]C[Is this the correct way to approach? Is on the same principle as before - stay in between, have the stronger group, remember that I have the k2 stone so he has no base

Arne: Yes w in serious trouble, but think leaning attack at D6 is even more severe]
;W[go];B[dn];W[dm]
(;B[co]C[Arne: W is happy, just extend here];W[en];B[do]
(;W[cm]C[Normally this shape is bad, but it seems ok with the stone at e3? Still not very stable, but I wanted the cut at next move.

Arne: Well B lives and gets some territory but seperating W is much better.
Arne: W connects on the wrong side here.];B[em]C[Arne: Indeed cut here]
;W[fn];B[el];W[ck];B[gl];W[in];B[kl]C[Arne: good move!];W[kn]
(;B[nm]C[Arne: W almost dead];W[il]
(;B[qj]LB[hm:A][ql:B]C[Arne: There's a cut at A but better to leave it for later.

B is more severe probably better.];W[ol];B[oj]C[Rather than try for a kill straightaway, I build potential for territory around r13-r14 by making him run. his groups are still very weak.]
