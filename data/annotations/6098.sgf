Hi Dear reviewer,

In this game, i play as black. I am a moyo oiented player, i like very much takemiya's style. I made some mistakes in the endgame, but i would like you to focalize on the middle game, i think i may have done better in terms of attack.

Thank you very much.

LB[qd:A][pf:C][qf:B]C[reid: this is a bit slow for white.  Black's natural response at A helps build a nice moyo.  More usual would be a double approach at B or C.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[mc]LB[oc:C][rc:D][nd:A][rd:B][ql:F][qq:E]
C[reid: this is also slow.  But white A and B suffer from the aji of too many cut points after black C.

How about white D?  If black preserves his moyo by blocking at B, then white A is good.  If black exchanges A for N17 first, then black B is gote (white probably invades at E or F).]

(;B[no]C[Was P3 better ?

reid: It looks like P3 would be another possible way to play.  See comments in variation.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[mq];B[lo]LB[lp:A]C[reid: black has a lot of stones here.  A seems to be a bit better - it has more effect on the white N3 stones.]
;W[li]LB[lg:B][jh:C][ji:A][mi:F][ni:E][mj:D]C[Typical invasion, i did not think of a good way to attack it directly, so i let it for later.

reid: As I mention in the variation to move 16, black wants to use his framework to attack white, and the earlier the better.  If black fails to attack now, he risks losing his investment.  White has taken his profit - he's got four corners already.  Black needs to make equal profit (plus komi), either directly, or by attacking.

Here white has "crossed the line" between black's furthest outposts (G5 and N15).  That puts him inside black's territory.  The cap at A seems to let white out too easily (white B), so black C looks like a better option.

Just like in the variation on move 16,  black's strategy should be to try to solidify some of that territory.  It is not reasonable to kill this white stone, so black should not assume it will die.  Instead, assume it will live but try to make moves that threaten to kill it while improving black's position.  If white lives small inside, black should get good thickness outside.  If white runs out, black should get some territory.

Taking profit with D, E, or F might be enough (because white has made some slow moves), but it doesn't feel like the right use of the moyo.]
;B[de];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ch]C[reid: this result is joseki locally, but in this game, the F16 stone helps the lone M11 stone, so it doesn't feel right to me.]
;W[oi]LB[pi:A]C[reid  think white should attach at A instead.  Even more so since white has F16 in place (M11 still has a friend, even if he gets cut off from the attaching stone at A).]
;B[oj]C[I found Q11 too submissive.];W[ni];B[mh];W[mi]LB[qh:A]
C[reid: Does this exchange help black?  I don't think so.  It seems to help white more than black (N12 doesn't really do anything for black, but white is now much stronger).  That makes this exchange aji-keshi (erasing the potential).

If you don't want your opponent to win, you should not help him.  Avoiding aji-keshi should be very high up on your list of "things to do to get better at go".

The normal slide to A (instead of the N12/N11 exchange) would be much better here.]
;B[pi];W[og];B[ph];W[mg];B[cn]C[reid: Hmm, black has helped white to get stronger around N13, and now he's walking away?  I'd be worried about white Q13, cutting off the four Q16 stones...]

(;W[dn];B[dm];W[co];B[en];W[do];B[em];W[cm];B[cl];W[bn];B[ji]
;W[kg]C[reid: now white Q13 is even more dangerous.];B[ig];W[ke]
;B[ie];W[hf]LB[ff:C][ck:B][bl:A]C[reid: now it's white's turn for aji-keshi.  If white wants to get into the left-center area, he should just jumpt to C (after exchanging A for B).]
;B[if]C[reid: this exchange is much better for black than for white.]
;W[of]C[reid: hmm, white would be satisfied with taking the single N15 stone?  Too small!]
;B[qf];W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[ff];B[kd];W[le]LB[jd:A][ld:C]
[fh:D][mk:B]C[reid: white is playing very submissively in this area.  Cutting at A, jumping to B, even cutting at C all seem to be better.  Or tenuki to play something like D.

The center white stones already have one eye, and for black to attack it effectively, he needs to stop the connection, so white doesn't really have too much to worry about here.  White B is almost enough for a second eye already.]
;B[fh];W[kk]LB[mk:A][nl:B][mn:C]C[reid: this jump is awkward.  Better to make a solid jump to A, looking to continue either to the right with B or to the left with L9.  White might try the peep at C first (before A) to see how black answers.]
;B[kj];W[jh]C[reid: more aji--keshi.  After black blocks at J12, the center belongs to black.  White can no longer think about G12, for example.]
;B[ih];W[lj];B[jk];W[ki];B[jj];W[kl];B[jl];W[km];B[jm];W[mn]
LB[ml:A]C[Here, i did not know where was the biggest point to play...

reid: hmm, white has some awkward shape here.  It looks like A is the key point for black (center point of three).  Black can't expect to cut off anything major here, but he should be able to lock up the right side territory - perhaps even in sente.]
;B[fq];W[eq];B[fp]C[At the end, i found this move quite small..

reid: yes, it's gote now, and even though descending to F2 may be sente, taking G3 with another move would be a second gote, so it's not very big.  Even simple moves like S3 (or S17), A9 (to stop the clamp) or even J17 are bigger than F3.]
;W[om];B[pm];W[ol];B[pl];W[rq];B[rp];W[sp];B[so];W[sq];B[ro]
;W[eg]LB[dh:A]C[Here, i did not find a good move to answer this one.

reid: yes, this could have been some trouble for black before white helped make that solid wall at J12.. But now, black A should be good enough to stop white's encroachment.]

(;B[ee]LB[cg:B][dh:C][eh:A]C[reid: this looks like another helping move.. White's response threatens to make a fair territorial gain on the top edge.  And if white feels he's losing, he could still play at A or B before responding.

Better for black to simply block with C.];W[hd]C[This move is so good ....]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[cg];W[id]C[Here i counted :
white : 75 points
black : 25 points on right side, 30 points in the center, 8 points on the left...]
;B[oc];W[ob]C[I tried to use some weaknesses...];B[nb]C[reid: if black fails to make profit in the area around L17 ( and that looks difficult to do), then black has thrown away yose points around S17 (after white responds with Q18).]
;W[pb];B[ld];W[md];B[jd];W[je];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[ne]LB[jb:C]
[kb:B][rb:E][jc:D][kc:A]C[White's mistake !

reid: yes.  Best here is simply white A.  Then if black ever tries B, white C stops him cold.  If instead black C, white still has time to play B (if black D, white O15).  Black E makes a dead shape in the corner, but it's a big eye, so white will win the capturing race.

For his last 6 moves, black has just been giving points to white.]

(;B[jb]C[Black's mistake...];W[ka];B[ja];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[fr]
C[I thought that the top was alive, but in 30 seconds i just hurried too much

reid: Yah.  Since both sides made major mistakes in this life-and-death situation, I will end the analysis here.

I think both sides should concentrate on avoiding aji-keshi.  That's the single most common mistake I see in this game.  In addition black wants to play a moyo type game, so he should work to make his moyo stones effective - attack the invading stones.

Actually, it's not really a good idea to play just one type of game.  All your opponent needs to do to put you at a disadvantage is to force a different style of game.  A flexible player who can respond to different styles is a much more formidable opponent.  As a strong player, it's your job to find the move that is required by the current board position.  Trying to force the game to a preferred style is a sure way to stall your progress and lose games to stronger players.

Good luck, play strong - reid.];W[hb];B[cq];W[er];B[es];W[ds]

(;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[lp]TR[go][jp]C[Like this, i thought that the marked stones would be weak, so the attack would not be profitable.

reid: Well, strength and weakness is always relative.  Your two stones (K4, G5) are facing off against 5 white stones (G3, D4, M4, O3, and O4).  O3 and O4 don't really contribute much towards attacking black, and D4 is not all that close, either.  The black stones have easy access to the center, so they are not really all that weak. 

The three white stones are are goiing up against 5 black stones (K4, G5, P3, Q4, and R6.  In the distance, Q10 and the N15 wall are waiting.  In addition, it's now black's move.  So I think it's safe to say that white is weaker than black in this fight.

If you want to focus on moyo strategy, it's important to understand what the moyo is for.  The idea is to build a fast framework that you can use to attack white when he invades.  This is a fairly classic example: white has invaded, and black should use his high stones to attack the invader.  In general, the earlier you can use your influence, the better your attack should go.  Your goal in this attack would be to solidify the right-hand side territory in sente.

If I were playing black, I would welcome this fight (I would probably play L6 next).]
