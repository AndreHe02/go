C[This was a seriously suspenseful game for me.  In the end I won by half a point but only because my opponent missed a very difficult-to-spot weakness in his territory.
MR: Enclosed please find the review of your game. Besides trying to answer the questions you posed in the game record, I tried to indicate situations at which I had chosen a different route in the game. My feeling is that the main topic of the game is "balance of power" - keeping part of the problem with the opponent when making life for one's own weak groups and utilizing weaknesses of opponent stones to take some advantage.]

MR: P2 is natural. B O4 directly is certainly an overplay. I just showed one variation ...]

If you want to push at Q14, you can do this directly. Most likely, P17 or P13 are better ideas ...]

;B[ed];W[cj];B[ke];W[ie];B[kg];W[oh];B[pi];W[jf]C[MR: ?
This peep weakens your own stones around Q15. If you want to peep, my feeling is that you rather should peep from the other side with M14. 
In general, in situations where it is not clear from which side one wants to peep, one should better not peep at all.

Anyway, the white group in the upper right is the group you currently have to take care of.]
;B[kf];W[ih];B[oi];W[mh];B[ki];W[oc]C[MR: Altthough this is a key point in the white shape, white should first continue separating the black center stones to keep the balance of power (if black is safely connected, it is only white who has to struggle for life).]

;B[mf];W[nd];B[lc];W[mb];B[mc];W[nc];B[le]C[I think this is a mistake here.  I figured he'd come down at Q18, I'd hit 019 and he'd do M19 to cut off my second eye, then I would try to cut him around M11/L12 and fight for life.  But I guess he made it too easy for me here?
MR: I agree that he made it very easy for you here. However, the problem after B Q18, W O19. B M19 is that white can play M14. This threatens either to capture the stones N14, O13, O15 or to cut off the four black stones around L17. However, B M15 is small if white can live anyway, so black should first play some manouvers against the white group in the upper left (for example, black K15 is sente against the variation mentioned above against the white group in the upper right).]

MR: If you feel to have enough territory and cannot read out the variations, it is a sensible strategy to invest an extra move to secure the own groups. 
Looking on the board from a strategic point of view, my idea would be to attack the black corner in the upper left. If black has to struggle for life there, he will automatically strengthen the white group in that area (that is itself not fully secured).]

MR: Yes. You are behind some 15 to 20 points. 
Strange enough that you both played few point endgame moves for the last 50 moves or so. 
In my own games, if I feel to be behind for more that 5-10 points, I try to create some kind of trouble, and if it does not work I simply resign. One potential area for trouble would have been to try to cut of the black stones around E10 with F7, but of course before peeping with G5 and before allowing black to connect them to the upper left corner.

In addition, the main point is that black does not need to play the ko! He can simply allow you to capture the black stone Q9 - and still has more territory.]

(;W[cj]C[MR: In my opinion, if white exchanges C14 for F16 he should follow up with an extension on the left side around C10. This is because white has a weakness at B C8, and if white defends the lower left corner, black can play an extension that is at the same time a pincer against C14.]
