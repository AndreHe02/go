C[Dear reviewer,

This game was played in a tournament in Turkey. I played with black. Both of us are 1 dan player.

forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for submitting an interesting game. I think there are some good learning points here. Overall, I thought it was a game between two reasonably balanced opponents. Black got in a little trouble early along the top but did a good job of enclosing the center after that. Unfortunately the game essentially ended when Black died in the upper left with essentially no compensation. Let' s have a look at some places that Black could have improved his chances...]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[jp]
(;W[qn];B[po];W[qk]C[I didn't see this move in Kobayashi, was this playable?

ff - This is a known but rare variation in pro games. The idea of extending back and then playing in the top right is better known when White plays the high approach. See the variation to move 8 earlier.]
;B[pn]
(;W[qg]C[ff - This distant approach is relatively popular with pros right now (although not in exactly this position). It is mainly for when White wants to discourage an invasion. However, in this case the stone is relatively strong and Black can be in some difficulty if he does not respond.]

(;B[fc]C[ff - I think this is too aggressive here. White has played rapidly with the R9, R13 combo and outnumbers Black on the top half of the board. Black should settle for answering R13 to avoid becoming too thin. See the variation.]
;W[hc]C[ff - This is a good idea by White, taking advantage of Black's general weakness at the top.]

(;B[fe];W[df]
(;B[id]C[ff - This inevitably strengthens White along the top. It is not clear that Black can expect sufficient compensation in the center.]
;W[ic];B[jd];W[hd];B[he];W[jc];B[kd];W[lc];B[me];W[nc]C[I am not sure this thickness was good for me since white has R13 stone. But I thought that by using this thickness I can attack white's right side group.

ff - I think you are right to be concerned here. It is not easy to decide how to continue here. Basically White's top and rightside stones both look more settled than Black's top and upper right corner. If both Black and White are cut in two, White may end up better off. Should Black play to connect and strengthen his stones?]

(;B[qi]C[ff - This is a tough response. However, Black is thin in the upper right. There is a risk that Black will not get enough profit from this attack.]
;W[qm]
(;B[pg]C[ff - Attaching here leaves White with a lot of options. Choosing the White stone at R13 as the target does not take advantage of Black's thickness at the top or the framework at the bottom.]
;W[ol]C[ff - With one move the White stones start to look pretty safe while reducing Black's center formation. Meanwhile there is plenty of play left in the R13 stone.]

(;B[fo]C[Maybe I could play N4 area, but it looks not urgent to me. I thought that after playing F5, if white attack N4 area I can fight.

The action on the right side is not finished. This looks like a mistake in direction.]

(;W[lo]C[ff - This seems like an overplay. Black should be happy]

(;B[lp]C[ff - It is tempting to try to turn the bottom into territory but this seems rather defensive. See the variation...]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[op];B[pp];W[mn];B[no];W[oo];B[np];W[kp];B[lq]

(;W[ko];B[kq];W[nq];B[mq];W[nn];B[mp];W[jo];B[ip];W[on];B[oq]
C[ff - Let's ask ourselves whether Black has gotten full value from the F5 stone here. Doesn't it look over-concentrated?]

(;W[dr]C[ff - This seems like a very passive use of White's new center thckness. Also Black has just strengthened the bottom so this is smaller than it would have been before White played M5. Black should be happy about this play.]

(;B[jj]C[Tengen looks very important for both of us.

ff - I think this is sound judgement. The one potential problem is that if the White stones are strong enough to ignore this play, it may turn out to be rather small in terms of territory. Black makes the topside stones much stronger. Next we have to be sure to use the stones well to make territory elsewhere.]

(;W[gd];B[ge];W[fd]
(;B[dj]C[ff - Black should be more concerned about the corner. It does not seem likely that Black can make enough in the center to compensate if the corner falls completely to White.]
;W[ch]
(;B[dh]C[ff - This exchange is certainly bad because of the negative impact on the corner.]
;W[dg]C[ff - By now there is a high probability that Black can not live in the corner.]
;B[eh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[od];W[qh]C[Was R12 better instead of P16 for black?];B[ph]
;W[ri]
(;B[qj]C[ff - This is bad shape. Black does not want to play like this. See the variation...]
;W[rj];B[nj]
(;W[lj];B[pk]C[ff - This is not a good idea. What is the point? Forcing from this side makes it difficult to use Q7, which looks like a much more powerful play for the future.]

(;W[pl];B[lm]C[ff - There are far too many complexities in the next few exchanges to analyze conclusively. However, clearly Black is playing with a broader vision than White.]
;W[ll];B[jm]
(;W[km];B[kl];W[ml];B[kn]
(;W[ln];B[li]C[ff - This seems bigger than White's saving four stones with M6. I think that Black rather nicely outplayed White here. Black had a better appreciation for the overall position.]
;W[kk];B[kj];W[jk];B[ik];W[jl];B[il];W[km]
(;B[im]C[ff - This is too much of a good thing though, relative to other moves on the board. It is time to play C17.

Even if White cuts at J7, Black can take the ko and atari White's three stones to slow White down.]
;W[mj];B[mi];W[ci]C[C11 was big but I couldn't find time to play there.

ff - Again this is big because of the corner. Black wants to play C17, not around here.]
;B[cc];W[dc]
(;B[bd]C[B16 was a mistake I think. But I don't know if I played D18 instead of B16, could I live in the corner? I think, If I didn't die in the corner I can win the game.]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[cd];B[bc];W[db];B[bf];W[ce];B[be];W[ba]
(;B[cj]C[ff - Giving up the corner this way seems to mean giving up the game. Black has to consider carefully:
1. Does White win the fight here?
2. If yes, what is the best way to give up the stones!?];W[bg]
;B[dm]C[ff - This just does not seem big enough.];W[fg]
(;B[fh];W[ff];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[hf];B[if]C[ff - Black has given up about ten points here in gote.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[fr];B[gr];W[eq];B[gq];W[gs];B[oc];W[ob];B[nd]
C[ff - As mentioned in earlier variations, Black should be able do do better than this by cutting at O18.]
;W[mb];B[rc];W[rb];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[pf];B[qe];W[pi];B[oi]
