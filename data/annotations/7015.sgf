;B[pd]C[jitse [4k?\]: have a nice game
swanized [4k\]: hi];W[dd]C[swanized [4k\]: you too];B[qp];W[dp]
;B[oq];W[pj]LB[qg:B][qj:A][qm:C]C[1.here i'm just wondering if playing the move at r10 is better, I think so but I'm not sure.

It's more common to play at A (r10).  That way white can extend to B or C and form a base quickly.  Because white is inside black's strength (top right and bottom right), it is generally a good idea to settle quickly.]
;B[pl]LB[jq:A]C[is this good or should I developp top right instead?

This is good.  The bottom is bigger because you already have a corner enclosure.  Later black can aim to play at A to make a nice formation (corner enclosure plus extensions to both sides).]
;W[qf];B[mc];W[rd];B[fc]LB[qc:A][of:C][ph:B]C[Normally black has the option to tenuki as you did in the game.  In this situation I am inclined to play at A to force white to respond at B forming an overconcentrated shape.  Always look for opportunity to make white stones inefficient.  If white responds at C instead, then his shape is thin and black can invade later.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[fq]LB[hc:B][ic:A][kc:E][fe:C][he:D]C[here you usually extend at J17 but I'm wondering if this move is correct too(it was an experiement i dont usually play it)

No, black should play at A.  Try not to create a weak group.  White can pincer at B now.  If black runs out to C, white can either continue applying pressure at D or extend to E for a base.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq];W[ck];B[ic];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[go]LB[hq:A][lq:B]C[I have seen this move often, but it is really bad for white.  It helps black to solidify his bottom area.  Without this move, white can invade at A if he has a stone at B.]
;B[hp];W[jn]
(;B[ek]LB[dj:A]TR[ck]C[here i'm not sure if this move is ok.i don't think so and ithink that M4 would be better after all was just wondering if you could confirm these thoughts.

White's marked stone is a weak point because it is on the third line.  It's common to play a shoulder hit at A for a shallow reduction.  Please see variations for the continuation.]
;W[di];B[fi]C[is that right?

This is fine.];W[dm];B[ff];W[kd];B[le];W[jf];B[ke];W[je];B[jd]
;W[he];B[gd];W[hg];B[gh]C[is that kosumi any good?

You need this to stay connected.];W[lg];B[nf]C[Since white can connect, save these moves for later.]
;W[ng];B[of];W[og];B[qk];W[qj];B[ko]TR[jn]C[here we discussed afterward and decided that M4 would be better can you confirm our thoughts?

M4 is too conservative and it has no impact to the marked stone.  The game move is better.]
;W[mp]C[This white's move is unreasonable.  There is no easy way for it to make live.]
;B[ln]LB[mn:A]C[A will be trouble for white.];W[nn];B[mm]C[swanized [4k\]: never played so much kosumi in a game
jitse [4k?\]: it's a good one, your last move
swanized [4k\]: thanks


here i decided that this was the best move to play you got anything better?

I can't see any move that can stop white from running out.]
;W[ol]C[swanized [4k\]: your m13 was not bad either];B[om]LB[pm:A]
C[Since white can run out, black should simply descend at A.  The game moves form a weak group for black and bad shape for another group.]

LB[kk:A]TR[mj][nk][nl]C[here I try to kill the middle stones is there anything better?

This is necessary as your marked stones are weak.  A is more solid.]
;W[li];B[lj];W[jl];B[hm];W[hl];B[gm];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj]
;W[hi];B[ik];W[ih]C[i think i dealt with this ok you what do you think about it?

This exchange is clearly good for black.  He settles his weak center group and also gets more than 10 points in the cener.]

;B[mk];W[mi];B[hq];W[jr];B[cb]LB[rk:A]C[any bigger moves?

This is big, worth about 15 pointsl, but in gote.  I will look for double sente moves first.  For example, A is one of those points.]
;W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[rj]LB[rk:A]C[The game move is bigger than A but ends in gote.  I am more inclined to keep sente by playing at A.]
