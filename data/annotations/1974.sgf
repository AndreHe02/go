C[I am hv2go, a15k on IGS and in the  Netherlands clubcircuit about 10k.
I thought I had lost the game by a large  margin, but somehow managed to come  back from behind. Was I lucky is my main   question?
My oponnent was enic. He is an 8k on  IGS. We did not use a handicap.

RickMott: Hi, J.W., I'm doing your review.  Hope it's helpful...]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[de];B[ce]MA[ee]C[Black: should I have played at the X-mark  (E15) ??

RickMott: Not necessarily, since there is no position in the upper right
yet.  I think what you chose is quite standard.];W[cd]MA[cf]
C[black: I expected white to play at X(C14).  And did not really know what to do.

RickMott: Yes, C14 is normal.  This is wrong for white; you can cut or you
can extend to C14 yourself.  If you extend, white will be forced to connect
and you can extend at the top also to E17.  White's stones are not doing
much for him.];B[dd];W[cc]
(;B[ee]C[RickMott: No, attack the two-stone group first with a hane at C18.  I think
this weakens your C15 stone for not much gain.  See variation.]
;W[df];B[be];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc];W[ef]C[RickMott:  This is a mistake by White.  You can kill his corner with B16.
See variations.]
(;B[fe];W[ff];B[dj]MA[ge]C[black: I realized after playing D10 that a  play of white on X might give me trouble.  However I did not want white to play on  D10.

RickMott: D10 is OK, but you should still take the corner first with B16.
Otherwise your two stones are weak.];W[ge];B[fd];W[gg];B[pd]
MA[jc][jd]C[black: here I played Q16, but considered  to play on the marked positions (L16 /  L17). But had no idea what to use as a  follow up after that move.

RickMott: This is fine.  Taking the last open corner is more valuable than
an extension from your existing position.  However, it's still more
important to attack the upper left.  White's next move will make that
impossible.];W[bg]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Now you cannot take the corner because white can trap
you in a shortage of liberties.  This changes the score by more than 30
points.]
(;B[jq]C[black: a wing formation seemed good.

RickMott: Seems OK.  You have a sente play at C12, threatening to pull out
the captured stones, if you want it.  That would help close the open left side
later.];W[nd];B[pf];W[gd];B[ic]C[RickMott: Good, otherwise white G18 kills you.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[id]C[RickMott: This is a small and overconcentrated move by white.  You could ignore
it and make a big play on the right side, R6 or R8.];B[jc];W[jd]
;B[kc];W[kd];B[ld]MA[lc]C[black: Later I thought stretching at X (L17)  might have been better??

RickMott: The real issue is that you're fixated on the local area, when you should be
looking at the big open area on the right side.  U.S. pro Janice Kim likes to quote a
Korean proverb that goes something like "Rush to plant your flag."  As soon as you
have (a) no weak groups under immediate attack, and (b) no weak opposing groups
you can attack, you should look for a big play.  Exactly where to play is a matter of
choice, but any of (Q6, R6, Q8, R8) seem reasonable.];W[lc]
;B[lb];W[mc];B[hc];W[mb];B[kb]C[RickMott: Both players are making the same error.  This connection is worth about 4
points.  Surely there are bigger plays available.];W[bj]C[RickMott: White is first to come out of the trance.]

(;B[cl]C[RickMott: You could defend a bit more agressively with a play at C13, using the aji
in your two dead stones.];W[pj]C[RickMott: Making the first play in this area is big for white.]
;B[qh];W[qi];B[gj]C[RickMott: Good idea, but I think you need to think on a larger scale.  This doesn't
threaten much of anything.  How about extending from the other side to N14?  That
would threaten to pull out your M16 stone and make an attack on white's four-stone
group possible.  If you're going to extend here, you should probably go at least one
or two lines further (H10, J10, maybe even K10) to neutralize white's wall.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[qf]
;W[ph];B[rf]C[RickMott: White has pushed you around a bit here.  You don't have to make this
connection to live, so you must find a bigger play to get compensation for white's
outside strength.  Approaching white's lower right corner, for example.]
;W[lq]C[RickMott: Compare this to a black play at O3 or O4.  Big difference!]
;B[nq]C[Black: I decided to play O3 and sacrifice  this stone, so I could build a wall on the  K-line, I thought this might give me an  advantage.

RickMott: I think you have to fight; you can't sacrifice because white will get a huge position
in the lower right corner.  White's 3-line knight's move is weak, so you have to jump in.
You could consider a contact play at R4 instead, which is more flexible for fighting and
splits white's potential area roughly in half.  Remember, your lower left position is still
vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion and various reducing moves.];W[np]
;B[ko]C[RickMott: If you weren't going to help your O3 stone at all, why play it?  Why not play L5 straight off?
I would recommend wedging at P4 here, followed by atari at N4 and connect if white ataris at P3 or
P5.  You would have reasonable chances in the resulting fighting.]
;W[oq];B[mn];W[mq]C[black: I thought whites moves were  dubious, I thought I got more than white  here.]
;B[om]C[RickMott: White has spent a lot more stones than he should have capturing your
sacrifice, so the end result is good for black.  With better play by white, though,
this shouldn't have worked so well.];W[pm];B[ol];W[pl];B[ok]
;W[cq]MA[jj][kj][jk][kk]C[black: If I had been white I would have  played around the marked spots. (K9/10  L9/10) ???

RickMitt: No, the corner invasion here is well timed.  You can't close the gap in your moyo
with one move, so white will still be able to make a reducing move here after the corner
is finished.];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[bn]C[RickMott: Good move!  I think the double hane is superior to the extension here.]
;W[cn];B[do];W[bm];B[cm]C[RickMott: But this is not the best follow-up sequence.  If white chooses to atari on the
outside with B7, you should counter-atari at B4 and then take the corner with B3.]
;W[an];B[dn];W[bn];B[jj]C[RickMott: Tough call.  I might have played this at L9, but it's arguable either way.
White has an easier game than black now; you must defend one big center territory
with a lot of weak borders, white has secure territory left and right and a nice wall
facing the center to back up his reducing moves.  He does not have to play very
aggressively to come out ahead.  Center territories are never as big as they look.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[kr]C[RickMott: This threatens a monkey jump, which would reduce your territory by a bit
at the bottom, but you can expand it by almost as much at the top with something
like N10 with better follow-up moves to destroy the influence of white's wall.  It
might also be interesting to think about a move like M15, which makes pushing at
M16 dangerous for white.  Thinking about sente is important.  You can make a sente
reduction of the right side at Q6, followed by Q5, for example -- a difference of at
least 6 points compared to allowing white P6.];B[jr];W[ej];B[ek]
C[RickMott: Too passive, white's last move was an overplay.  You should hane on the outside
at E11.  You still want to think about the aji from B15-C15, too.]
;W[dk];B[fj];W[ck];B[ei];W[el]C[RickMott: Bad move for white.  He should play D8, threatening to either take 2 stones or
break into your territory.];B[dl];W[bl];B[dm];W[ki]C[black: Here I started counting territory and   calculated, in spite of the large territory  in the middle, that white was far ahead.

RickMott: Not necessarily, although it looks that way.  You have a number of sente reductions
in what looks like white territory.  For example, poking in at Q9, then following up with Q6
is good; a hane at D7 looks harmless but could result in big trouble for white it he answers
on autopilot, because it changes the liberty balance; poking at H16 and folowing up with M15
is still a possibility.  N14 is still good, too.  R19 may be sente because of the weakness at
P17.];B[kj]C[RickMott: But if you keep playing simple blocks, allowing both sides to solidify
their position, it will be harder to win.  When you perceive you're behind, you
must aim for complication.];W[lj];B[lk];W[mj];B[mk];W[ji];B[ij]
C[RickMott: These are all passive moves, and white should be happy.  If he plays
correctly, he should get territory in the upper center now and win easily.]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hh];B[nf]C[black: this seemed like a good reduction  move ??

RickMott: Yes, this is Ok.  I might go a line further to N14.]
;W[of]C[RickMott: This is a bad move for white.  He should just make territory with a move like M14.
When you're ahead, avoid complications and consolidate positions.]
;B[oe];W[mf]C[RickMott: Another strange move.  White has no business making contact moves here.]
;B[le]C[RickMott: Good idea!];W[me];B[og]C[RickMott: Poke in at H16 first.  You will get a very good reduction out of it.  If white
just connects here now (H16), there's not much you can do.]
;W[nh]C[RickMott: But he doesn't see it either.];B[hd]C[RickMott: Brilliant!!!!]
;W[he];B[kq];W[lr];B[pk]C[RickMott: Yes, this is a very good sequence for you.  Good choice.]
;W[qk];B[pn]C[Black: this is one of the few times in the  game I thought I played well. What I  calculated in my head actually happened.]
;W[on]C[RickMott: Bad move by white.  He gave you even more points.]
;B[qn]C[RickMott: correct response.];W[ql];B[oo];W[qo];B[rn]
C[RickMott: Perfect!!  You have a monkey jump to either side.]
;W[ro];B[nn]MA[sk][so]C[Black: here I felt insecure. Should I have  played the X-marked spots(T5 / T9) first ?

RickMott: Not yet, but you shouldn't capture.  Look for a sente move; R19 for example.
The poke at P17 might be good, too.  Then the sente T5 before the gote T9 gets you
both of these.];W[rm];B[oh];W[oi];B[ng];W[mg];B[ni];W[mh];B[oj]
C[RickMott: No, O10 is better because you threaten another atari.  Ko isn't good here.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[mi];B[cj];W[bk];B[ch];W[bh];B[cg];W[cf];B[gh]
;W[fh];B[ie];W[je];B[if];W[jf];B[hf]MA[hg]C[Black: this was the wrong move. I should  have played at the X-mark(H13) and set  up a snap back at G14.

RickMott: Yes, I agree.  Good idea on the original cut, though.]
;W[gf];B[jg];W[ig];B[od]C[RickMott: Hane at R19 first.  This way, you just force white to fix his problem.]
;W[oc];B[pg]C[RickMott: Not sente; T5 would be better.];W[qh]
;B[lo]MA[sn]C[Black: I wanted to protect my territory  here, but considered playing at the  X-mark(T6). ?? what would have been  better ??

RickMott: T5, not T6. T5 gets you three more points in sente.]
;W[sn]C[RickMott: This is worth 4 points for white.];B[qm];W[rl]
;B[po]C[RickMott: This is only 1 point.  Hane at one of: D19, N19, R19, D1, K1 first.  Or poke at
B11.];W[op];B[no];W[ra]C[RickMott: Your playing R19 would be 5 or 6 points better for you than allowing this.]
;B[sb];W[dh];B[eh]MA[di]C[Black: wrong move. Should have been at  (D11)

RickMott: I like B11 instead.];W[ci];B[di];W[dg];B[ks];W[ls]
;B[js];W[gi];B[hj];W[fi];B[eg];W[fg];B[ej];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh]
;B[da];W[ca];B[ea];W[es]C[RickMott: You should ignore this and play B16 to take the upper left corner!!!!!]
;B[fs];W[ds]C[Black: Calculating everything I thought I  was loosing with a large margin. Now I  could resign or try everything I could  think of.

RickMott: Now I can answer your question at the beginning.  You were lucky.  White should have
ignored the one-point connection at D1 and played B16.  You can capture the corner, finally,
because of white's automatic response to block at C19 giving him a shortage of liberties.]
;B[bd];W[bc];B[ac];W[ab];B[ba];W[ad];B[ae]C[RickMott: Ko is good for you, you have many, many threats.]
;W[bf];B[ac];W[fr]C[RickMott: Poor choice of ko threat, corner is bigger.  White could have tried (for example)
E17, threatening to connect out.  You have good threats all over the place, though; L14,
and cuts in the lower right corner.];B[gr];W[ad];B[kf];W[hg]
;B[ac];W[eq]C[black: I could not figure out if this Ko  threat would reduce my territory more  than the points I would gain by capturing  the stones in the corner. I did not dare to  risk it and captured the single white  stone. I also thought I had some more  threats to go.

RickMott: The corner capture is worth 30 points, but yes, the reduction would be pretty big.
Hard to say.]
(;B[ep];W[ad];B[nr]C[RickMott: This isn't a good threat.  The cut at R4 should be good, though.  If white
ignores it, you can either capture 2 stones or maybe live in his corner, which would
be very big.];W[af];B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[or];B[ms]C[RickMott: very good!  I take it back, the ko threat was good :)]
;W[ns];B[os];W[ps];B[kp];W[ns];B[mr];W[os]C[Black: at this point I thought I might have  a small chance.]
;B[ma];W[na]
(;B[la];W[qq]MA[qp]C[Black: I cried my eyes out when I saw this  move. The cut at the X-mark (R4) would  have given me quite a few points, the  points I needed to win.

liberties and you will lose the capturing race.];W[ab]C[RickMott: You can't connect, because white will play B19 and live.  Then your group
obviously dies.];B[ba]C[RickMott: So you try B19.];W[ad]C[RickMott: But now it's 3 liberties to 4 in white's favor.  He just fills your liberties
from the outside and wins.])

have to connect at E19 and playing A16 would cost you a liberty.]

(;B[bd]C[RickMott: So how does White live?  Trying to make an eye in the corner
with A18 or B19 can be answered with black B17, which makes B18 and
D17 miai.  The only tricky play is a block at B17.  You must respond with
an extension on the side or White can win the capturing race, but white
still cannot live.  I think this is worth giving up E15.]
