C[I tend to feel more comfortable with large moyo games. Tried my attempt at a more fighting game, not looking for the safest path.

Michael: Hi there, I'll be reviewing your game, sorry it's late. :(]

(;W[pp];B[qd]
(;W[cd]C[I have little experience, but i usually start on the star points. Wanted to try 3,4 point here.

Michael: This is the better of the two 3-4 moves you could have tried here.  Though I would have considered a 44 here, because that makes black's enclosure urgent.]
;B[jd];W[ec]C[Seems appropriate to close the shimari, if black plays e17 i will have a weak stone and black gets a large moyo in return.

Michael: This seems a bit small scale.  Which is another reason why you ought to have played on the 44 instead.]

(;B[cl]
(;W[ci]LB[cm:1][cn:2][co:3]C[Extend looks good from shimari, and blocks black extension

Michael: See variations.  You need to play more aggressively because Black is being too greedy.]
;B[pj];W[jp]TR[ec]C[Expected k4 and q10 to be miai

Michael: The problem with that is now Black can play P17 and make a very strong double wing formation.  This situation is because you effectively lost a move with E17.]

(;B[gq]C[My two groups felt strong enough, so went on to invade blacks weak spot. This was where i first decided not to walk a comfortable path]

(;W[oc]C[Michael: You have several possibilities here];B[pc]

(;W[od]C[I know 14 is better without black on k16 but could not think of a better move]
;B[md]
(;W[nf]C[Tried to run out and split black in two

Michael:  I don't like this.  This group is floating without a base, and all of Black's stones are high, meaning that running isn't as effective.]
;B[pg];W[qm]C[Proverb: Don't go fishing when your house is on fire.]

(;B[df];W[ei]C[Considered c14 as an option. But did not want to allow black too much center influence]
;B[fe]
(;W[dn]C[Wanted to reduce blacks corner while planning on getting help from e11 or k4 when needed. Looking back at this move, i believe i am creating too many weak groups for myself.

Michael: Your enemy left a knight's move, we can use those.]

Michael: Yes, d8 is better.];B[co];W[cm]C[I believe d8 is definitely better now.]

(;W[mj]C[That stone isn't worth anything.  Don't save it.];B[ml]

(;W[kk]C[I did not know where l9 will lead me, but it seemed like an interesting move with nice potential at cutting black. L9 could always run towards the white groups on the left or bottom]
;B[ll];W[jj]C[I believed l8 was simpler, but because black at l7, and my hunger for cutting tried out k10]
;B[ki];W[jk];B[ih];W[hg]C[Considered g13 or g14. Not knowing which is best decided this triangle shape is strong enough to try out]

(;W[jm]C[With my plan not working, decided to tenuki and maybe save these stones later or use as aji, even though it was a painful decision

Michael: You gave up too early, there's still a lot of possibility here for white.]

Michael: Good idea, but these moves would be better for that.]

Michael: Should have been played immediately, it's worth a lot of points, if black had connected earlier and then used that to attack your outside stones it would have gone very bad for you.]
