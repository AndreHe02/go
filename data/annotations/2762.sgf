C[This wasn't a close game, but there were some specific situations that I was hoping to get some feedback about.  Also, any general comments on improvements would be greatly appreciated.  I am somewhat of a novice (I played consistently for about two months a couple of years ago and have just recently started back) so any advice will be helpful.  Thank's very much.

I am from Hong Kong, about 8k. Nice to review your game.];B[dq]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[jq]C[for 3-4 points, corner enclosure is big point, so C5 or P3 is big (C5 is bigger than P3). white is ni ren sei, so K17 is also big. if you really want an extension, L3 would be better (better shape with R4).]

C15 is big, and it is sente generally. for upper right corner, need not attach, simply R14 is ok.]

the center is bigger, but you must make sure your right black group is alive.]

it is very good for black to have a seki because the 2 black stones should be dead. the best way to finish off is S18.]

Once I got this Ko here, I initially thought I could use it to gain a few more points in endgame...(See additional comment on move 181)

white should play H12 instead of H13, so there should be no ko. this ko is a bonus for black.]

In general, I would really appreciate any advice on attacking into an established territory.  It's hard for me to do.

sorry, I can't think of any way to invade white moyo. from my view, there is no way to invade white moyo because white has no weakness.]
