(;W[cf]C[oc: wrong direction? better at a?
tibia: I would have played from the same side

** The two points are difficult to choose between -- which is
why C11 was quite a good point. Personally I would play C9
because having to play C2 feels rather submissive.];B[cl];W[cr]
;B[lc];W[rd]C[tibia: too early ? You risk to loose sente and maybe at this point there are bigger points. What about: K14, around L4, R13 ?
oc: my plan was to see your reaction. If you stress the outside as you did, i would make some erasing moves, leaving the corner for later on. If you defend the corner, i would attack the stone at r11.

** The more natural idea would be the invasion at R13 -- seeing as the white group
below is fairly solid. But I would feel that defending the top left is bigger.]
;B[qe]C[** Good and simple answer.];W[ph]C[** Not a bad idea to try to forestall P11.]
;B[qh]C[tibia: maybe Q11 is better

** I think so, even though it does not have too much effect on the
group below. If we assume Q11-P12-R12, the Q11-P12 exchange
is in black's favour, making the white group heavy.];W[qc]C[oc: this would be to early

** Ok to exchange R17-O17, but too early to take gote, agreed.]
;B[pc];W[qb];B[re];W[sc];B[pi]C[tibia: I am happy

** This move does not seem so big -- maybe black is paying too
much attention to white's O12 ? Two things to bear in mind are a)
that this move does not affect the white group below much, and
b) black's framework is still rather open -- he is lacking a stone
around M15 for example. Also black's framework is rather small.

I would prefer one of the points D17, E18, F17, H17 or H16.]
;W[op]C[oc: its not such a good idea because it strengthens you unneccessary. So a white invasion on the lower site would become harder.
tibia: agree

** Yes, this is bad.];B[oq];W[ke]C[** Good. Could also play something like K17 or M16.]
;B[no]C[** Seems a bit early to play this exchange. Black will not mind
if white plays O5 - that would only solidify the territory at the
bottom. Black O5 will also be sente later. There is very little
aji left in the R7 stone after the exchange O5-P6.];W[on];B[hc]
C[tibia: around K5 is probably better

** I think the top is bigger, although the importance of the
bottom was of course increased after O5. At the bottom,
if black plays around F6, white can still reduce, say at K5,
fairly safely.];W[ic]C[** Don't touch what you're attacking! Maybe L17 instead ?]
;B[hd];W[hf];B[ec]C[** The slide to D18 seems to be possible here. Playing at the
"corner" like this generally strengthens the opponent too much.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cb];B[eb];W[ca];B[ie];W[kg];B[fe];W[oe]C[** This feels a bit of an overplay -- black is rather thick around
here! I would prefer something like N16.

Is white ready to fight if black counter-attacks with M14 or O14 ?]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[of]C[** N15 is better here I think. The cross-cut gives white
forcing ataris on both sides. Black cannot be proud to
just capture P15!];W[og];B[pf];W[mf]C[** I would play N15 and turn elsewhere. The O15 stone is not
really that important.];B[me]C[** Again I would have turned elsewhere here -- white cannot cut
even if he captures O15.];W[le];B[ld];W[kp]C[** Big. Black should probably just play L3.]
;B[jo]C[** Nice aggressive move, but maybe an overplay? White has
no other really weak groups, and with his influence at the top
he should be ok.];W[mq];B[nq]C[** Maybe L5 instead and let white live small ?]
;W[ln];B[lq]C[** Black is understandably a little concerned about his own
safety, but this move is undeniably petty...];W[lp];B[mp];W[kq]
;B[mr];W[oi]C[** Or N7 ? In any case white's invasion has been a success.
Note that the black group on the left is beginning to look thin.]
;B[nn]C[** N7 ?];W[nm];B[lm]C[** This dos not quite seem to work. What's wrong with O7 ?
(W: N5 is answered by M5 - L5 - L6 .)];W[mm];B[kn];W[lo]
(;B[km]C[** The cut is not out of the question here, but it seems white
will live fairly easily after breaking through at K4. But it is not
good to force white to connect in this way, maybe starting with
E5 could be more interesting ?];W[mn];B[bn];W[bo];B[bm];W[bp]
;B[oj];W[ni];B[nj];W[mi];B[pk];W[ql];B[ol];W[om];B[rj]C[tibia: I thought a lot and then I chosed the wrong move. I think I should play L2 before attacking and S10 seems not so big for you, but you probably have to reinforce the group

** L2 certainly seems bigger. S10 and S3 can be seen as miai, so they
are not too big. There is also B13 or F5 to consider.];W[rq]
;B[rp];W[sp];B[qq];W[rr];B[qr];W[lr];B[rs];W[sq];B[ms];W[kr]
C[** Big to get L2 in sente.];B[qs];W[rk];B[fo];W[em];B[gm]
C[** B13 looks bigger here.];W[ef];B[if];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[ib]
;W[jb];B[hb];W[bh];B[bi];W[bg]C[** White has been able to take a lot of profit while
putting pressure on black's separated groups.];B[kj];W[jh];B[kb]
;W[ja];B[kc];W[jc];B[se]C[** Good play.];W[ra];B[pb];W[sb];B[el]
C[oc: now all groups are more ore less stable lets count
black:  left 7 points
bottom 15 points
bottom right 6 points
right 15 points
top 6 points
makes about 50 points total

white:
upper left 15 points
lower left 7 points
right 11 points
upper right 2 points
center 6 points
about 40 points

So i am behind by about 10 points without komi
there must be something wrong with my play but worst i didnt see it

tibia: in my opinion P4 and S16 were not strong moves. I missed L2!

** Using your count, black has 49 and white 41. But I think 15 pts. is
a bit too much for black's framework at the bottom. White could play
G2 and connect to either side without trouble, for example. I would
say that it's a close game, but taking into account that white has sente,
I think he is actually a little ahead at this point.];W[ir]
C[** Big.];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[jj];B[hs]C[** This is not urgent. The important thing here is the possible
white play at R10.];W[kk];B[jl];W[lk];B[mj];W[lj];B[qj];W[nl]
;B[ok];W[pm]C[** Forestalls black T9, but I am not sure it quite is biggest. K2 would
be 9 points in gote and secure half an eye at the bottom - T9 is about
3.5 points in reverse sente.];B[jr];W[jq];B[is];W[il];B[im]
;W[hl];B[hm];W[fk]C[oc: i am clearly going to far here. i was thinking that i am behind and playing one overplay after the other.

tibia: maybe, but my left group is still weak

** It looks good for black to get E9, so I would play E10 or
E9. There are many possibilities here though, and F9 is not
bad really.];B[ek];W[fj];B[gl];W[mb]C[oc: the biggest endgame i found

tibia: what about E10/E11 ?];B[mc];W[ka]C[** Since white takes gote here anyway it must be bigger to
play O18 now.];B[nb];W[la];B[gk];W[gj];B[ei];W[ed];B[fd];W[he]
;B[id];W[da];B[gb];W[ai]C[oc: as i played it i thougth it was 3 points in sente]
;B[aj];W[ah];B[er]C[** About 8 points.];W[dj];B[ej];W[di]C[** Could also cut.]
;B[cj];W[dh];B[ck];W[ia];B[ha];W[ea];B[fa];W[cn];B[fl]C[** This does not seems necessary - note that white
cannot reduce black to one eye in sente (white B9
black A8, for example).];W[hj];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[ar];B[ee]
C[oc: not good imho because you lost some liberties and i can try to make some points in the center.]
;W[de];B[gh];W[ff]C[tibia: you are right. I missed my problems after F14]
;B[gd];W[fh]C[** Better just at E12.];B[fi]C[** Better at E12.]
;W[eh];B[gi];W[hi];B[jk];W[ij];B[pg];W[oh];B[ch];W[cg]C[oc: the game is close now, in the 2-points range i think]
;B[en]C[** I would play E5.];W[eo]C[oc: to keep sente];B[fn]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[dm]C[** 3 points gote.];W[cm];B[dl];W[an]
;B[bl];W[jp];B[ip];W[mk]C[** Should be at T10 which is 3 3/4 points in gote]
;B[sk];W[sl];B[sj];W[oa]C[** 1 1/3 pts gote.];B[na];W[pa];B[sd]
;W[rc];B[am];W[ao];B[mq]C[oc: this was to small. there are several real points an the board. i must win the KO to win the game.

tibia: if you get the KO I think I have to play inside to live and this 1,5 points sente for you. Maybe I am wrong

oc: but only if i win the KO :) i think it was your last chance to get a jigo if you win the KO.

** I agree with this analysis. But black must play O16 - 1 pts reverse
sente - to have a chance. Assuming play proceeding as in the game black
would then have more than enough ko threats to secure the jigo.

(;B[pp];W[gg]C[tibia: maybe G13 is better for me than Q4 (I thought they were equivalent). Maybe I eventually lost the game here :)
