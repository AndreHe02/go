C[(sorry for my english)
I played with white.
I live in Ecuador(yeah! you can find Go in Ecuador)
This was a game I played in Ecuador national tournament, the winner goes to Japan to the international amateur championship.
Anyway It was the second time that I'm really close to win him.
I won him just once.];B[dq];W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[dk]LB[gp:B]
[jp:A]C[How should I play Its the first time that I see this fuseki. Variation of Chinese fuseki??

This is the High Chinese Fuseki.  Common plays by W are A, B and your move.]

(;W[cg]LB[bf:A]C[A is stronger shape.];B[eg];W[ic]LB[db:B][mc:A]
[jp:C]C[How was this move?

This move does not seem good.  I would play at A, hoping to keep the aji of F1 alive.  B and C are other options.]
;B[jc]TR[ic]C[The exchange of the marked stones favour B.];W[he]
C[These 3 W stones are very weak.];B[cb];W[bb];B[db];W[bc]C[This is not needed and giving up sente is almost equivalent to passing, therefore it is a big mistake.]

[gc][gd][hd][he][gf]C[This is a very bad result for W - 8 stones played for a heavy group which makes ZERO points.  This is the beginning of a losing game for W.]

Bad move - see variation.];B[ck]TR[cj]C[Again, this exchange favours B and is bad for W.]

I think you should attack B's weak group on the right.]
(;W[do];B[cn]LB[cp:B][fp:A]C[wrong direction of play - should be along the bottom]
;W[eq]LB[fo:A]C[W is outnumbered in this area and cannot fight too strongly.  The key is to make a light shape that can escape and live.  A is good enough I feel.]
;B[ep];W[dp];B[fq]LB[er:A]
(;W[cq]LB[er:A];B[er];W[co]C[Terrible shape and result - B is clearly better and winning the game already.]
;B[cr];W[bq];B[nq]LB[br:A]C[B could play A to keep the pressure on but he is ahead and no need to complicate.]
;W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[mi];W[kh];B[no];W[ld];B[lc]
(;W[lp]C[Its there any possibility to live over there?

No, this is bad overplay.  Better to try and attack B's weak group on the right or left (but neither will be easy).]
;B[ko];W[np];B[mp];W[op];B[mo];W[jq];B[iq];W[kq];B[mq]C[B is clearly ahead and the game is essentially over once these W stones are captured.  The reason it is close is because of B's mistake at 215.

Moves 18, 24, 30 and 32 were big errors and by move 38, W had a tough game ahead.  Move 46 was another mistake and big loss for W.

Overall, B made better shape and efficient with his stones, while W often made bad shape and exchanges.
