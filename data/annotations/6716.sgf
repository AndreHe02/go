C[Hi!

Overall this was a very good game. Black lost for two reasons. 

Firstly, his play was not powerful enough in attacking. The 3-3 points allow you to take control of the game because they don't need a follow-up move; they shouldn't be used for developing. 

In Go there is a broad range of play, from very defensive to very aggressive. Anyone who says that they have a particular "style" is a weak player; a strong player knows when each type of strategy is appropriate, and uses the entire spectrum to his advantage. In this game, both players missed chances to attack (and the other player, of course, missed the corresponding chance to defend).

Secondly, black lost a lot of points in the endgame. In particular, weak groups can be pressured right up until the end of the game. Groups which have been "safe enough" for many moves can be forced to defend as the board gets fuller, and there are many such tactics for scoring a few extra points.

If you have any questions at all, feel free to email me or send me a message on KGS. I play as "sixsix". Good luck!]

(;B[ce]LB[cf:A]C[This is the right direction; however, a pincer is  also good for white, so perhaps you could consider A (C14) instead, to make a pincer less appealing. 

This move is good though, and being afraid of a pincer is no reason to avoid approaching this corner.]

(;W[qm];B[qh]C[Black is very thin everywhere. White has no weak groups and lots of good invasion points. Black's strategy has been inconsistent, as he has tried to develop his 3-3 points as though they were 4-4 stones.

The idea of 3-3 stones is that they require no follow-up, so black can ignore them and play a fast-paced game, taking control by pressuring white's weak groups. They are not good for developing on a large scale.]
