C[I am playing black in this game.

I would like to hear mostly about my strategic mistakes, because I felt I could do nothing to white's moyos and my attacks gave me no profit. By the time the game ended, I was clearly behind in territory.

Thank you for looking at this game.

-Tuhkelo];B[qd]C[Hi, I'm Darrell.

I would point out that blitz games aren't generally the best to submit for reviews. That said, I will do my best.]

(;B[el]C[I would have been inclined to take the corner here.  Then black is settled and white's stone at D10 feels like it's in the wrong spot with black able to slide under.]
;W[ec];B[ch]C[seems too soon - black ends up with two weak groups and white has a single running group.  White is strong above and below, so this really can't work out well.]

(;B[em]C[I opted for outside influence.

D:  this seems wrong.  White's group will be unconditionally alive after capturing C8.]

White does need to move now to defend the center group however.]

I would say you still had a chance in the game.  White's group in the center is not alive.]
