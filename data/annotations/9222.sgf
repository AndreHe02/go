AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS reviewing this game for you.

Since you did not have any questions or variations in the game itself, I'll mention whatever I find noteworthy.]

(;B[qe]C[W: This only helps your opponent become stronger.]
;W[pf]LB[pg:1][ph:2][pi:3][pj:A]C[W: White is happy about this exchange, because the stone A is now a perfect extension from White's 2 stone wall. Typically the proper extension length is height of wall + 1.]

(;B[ro];W[cj];B[hd];W[cn];B[gq];W[cd]LB[cc:A][ce:B]C[W: At this moment you only want to think about two options, A or B where A is taking the corner points and B is closing White in while building a wall.]

(;B[cf]C[W: The idea of closing white in is good, but C14 does not put much pressure on the corner stone.]

Some tips:

Keep your stones connected. (Move 20)

Don't get closed in. (Move 31)

Keep your opponents stones separated. (Move 70)

Don't escape with dead stones. Your opponent will only get a bigger profit out of it. (Move 76)

Don't follow your opponent around. (Move 124)])
