C[Hi
in this game there was many fights and yet i managed to lose all of them :<
in the end it became blitz,but most of my mistakes were done with full thinking

Hello Andrey,

I'm Andrew, roughly a 3 dan in the US. I'm glad to be able to review your game.
You fell behind in the opening - it seems to be your biggest weakness. However, your play in the middlegame was decent - I only noticed a few mistakes in shape and aji. And, forthe most part, you attacked White's weak groups in the correct direction.
To help with your opening, Opening Theory Made Easy is a great book. I also recommend looking through several professional games - get a feel for the flow of the stones in the opening.
I hope I covered the problems that arose in your game. If you have an additional questions, feel free to email me at gizoku00@gmail.com.]

It's no problem :)
You have some interesting ideas and your plays were sometimes very sharp, and it shows that you try to make your stones do as much work as they can. However, this can be very dangerous (without eceptional reading skills).

I heard a phrase from a famous Japanese professional that went something like this:
"When we are beginners, we simply play the fundamentals. As we get better, we start trying to make our stones do more. But as we get really good, we revert back to the fundamentals - we understand that they are indeed the best moves to be played."]
