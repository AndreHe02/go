C[Hi, I (pupukani KGS 2d) will be reviewing this game.];B[qd]
;W[dp]C[hedin [8k\]: Hi have a good game];B[dd];W[pq];B[oc]
;W[qn];B[pj];W[ic];B[gc];W[lc];B[dj]C[This is probably ok, but I would play instead to the bottom or approach the corner. Approaching the corner is usually bigger, but moves like k3 are also common, since they break whites framework.]

(;W[cg]C[hedin [7k\]: White had to take lower side first right?

Yeah it is quite big. This white invasion stone could become heavy, while black will get profit.]
;B[ce]C[This is very good, now white has to seek eyes elsewhere, and you keep the corner.]
;W[bj];B[ck]C[hedin [7k\]: As black i was happy with this fuseki for black, am i right?

After this result the game looks good for black. Black has a territorial lead and also white has weaknesses at j17 and b10]
;W[bk];B[cl]C[you can also jump, but this is also good];W[bl]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[cn]C[hedin [7k\]: Black is happy to see white crauling on the second line. Is it right here?

Yeah, whites corner stone is reduced, and another black stone on the other side would be severe]
;W[bo]C[Now white is connected, but some aji still remains. White just played 5 stones on the second line and black got 5 on the outside.]
;B[fq];W[fp]
(;B[gp]C[hedin [7k\]: Are there some better ideas here ? I do not see any.


I always play this move without thinking. Just following the principle that you should hane from a tsuke, and nobi from a tsuke if you want to keep them weak. This white is alive so no need to nobi, just hane. Hane makes your own stone stronger.]
;W[eq];B[fo];W[gq];B[ep];W[fr]C[Black can also connect the ko for a similar result (see variation)]

(;B[hq];W[fp];B[eo];W[fq];B[hp]C[hedin [7k\]: I was quite happy to exchange the solid influence to reasonably big coder. Is 27-35 exchange good for black?

Yeah its very good, black just fixed his weakest group and also got good influence.]
;W[jq];B[lq];W[jo];B[lo];W[kp];B[lp];W[in];B[hn];W[jm];B[lm]
C[hedin [7k\]: I am not happy with form white got here, were i able to press him harder?

H6 could be at G6, but this white result cant be prevented. White also has a connection at h2.]
;W[hm];B[gm];W[hl];B[gl];W[ho];B[gn];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[hk]
LB[em:A]C[hedin [7k\]: I have considered the ledder does not works, i have a strong A group and 2 sources of influence so i cut. Was i right?

This stone is actually caught in geta. (see variation)

But to answer the question, if the cut would work, youd have nothing to worry about, since all your groups are strong. Even m3, since they have a lot of moves to settle or run.

Instead of cutting in these situations you can also just wait, white is in no real danger because of h2.]

(;W[ik];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi];W[gi];B[hh];W[gh]
(;B[il]C[see variation for blacks h13];W[im];B[jl];W[kl];B[ji]
;W[jk];B[jg]C[hedin [7k\]: Was this sacrifice a right way to get strength for my h12 group?

The sacrifice was unnecessary i think, since it became an eye.]
;W[ll]
(;B[nm];W[mn];B[no]C[hedin [7k\]: I feel proud for this move. Are there a better way to resist? Have it some flaws oppenent have not used?

This looks good. You can control which push white plays first by first connecting at n7, for example in a situation where white can push through o6]
;W[mm];B[nn];W[mo];B[mp];W[ln];B[ml];W[km];B[op];W[ko];B[nk]
C[Black should attack the corner, r5 is one possibility];W[mk]
;B[mj];W[nl];B[ol]C[This tactic seems pretty high level :)]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[li];B[lh];W[mh]LB[ji:A]C[hedin [7k\]: Going for this croscut i considered A group strong enougth am i right?

At the moment A is fine, G13 is an urgent point for both.

After this cut you should protect the double atari. M12 might have been overplay because of it. I wouldnt say its impossible if you want to keep white inside.]
;B[nh];W[mg];B[ml];W[lk];B[lg]C[Now you got a good result];W[mf]
;B[ke];W[le];B[lf];W[me]C[this exchange made white stronger. Maybe just l16 directly]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[hd];W[id];B[ie];W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[gf];W[eh]

(;B[gg]LB[ld:B][fh:A]C[hedin [7k\]: Was this slow? I were preparing F12 squise also strengthening myself against h15 group. But lost moment for M16.]

;W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[pg];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk]
(;B[rj]LB[qo:A]C[hedin [7k\]: I was loking for move like R5 now may it give more then this anty yose? S10 worth about 8 points right?

R5 is still possible, but now not so good as before R9 (see variation)

This yose move is more than 10 points. Monkey jump is 13 points if i remember correctly. S11 for white may be better than mokey jump]

It looks very solid so i dont think so];B[cr];W[dp];B[ld]C[hedin [7k\]: Is the ko threat good? It shows good in game, but is it really good?]
;W[co];B[md];W[mc];B[mb]C[hedin [7k\]: Can white live now?

It looks killable.];W[lb];B[jb];W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[la];W[ka]

(;B[nj]C[hedin [7k\]: Was out of time and missed simple kill here.

its still ok, its dead];W[oh]C[hedin [8k\]: sorry may i abck
hedin [8k\]: missid stupid thing .];B[oi];W[nf];B[ph]C[hedin [8k\]: oknevermind]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[jh];B[kh];W[ki];B[ih];W[ma];B[pb];W[ha];B[ga]
C[djed [8k\]: thx
hedin [7k\]: thanks
djed [8k\]: bye

The game was looking good for black all the time. You thought about influence a lot.

Next time remember that large keima enclosure from a komoku is not a very strong shape. You just need 1 stone nearby to make an invasion work. In this case r5 would have been a knock out]

))
(;B[hg]C[I always play this kind of moves. It strengthens the cutting stones by a lot, and the next move black can almost capture G11-stones.

The best case scenario would be blacks attack now from around m10, building the right side a little bit. It could even become a double attack since m17 is still weak. If white connects at h2, black has won the fight, since h2 is small in points and doesnt affect the rest of the board.]
