C[First game with the W. for me

2 questions:

What about the begining of the game ? Is there big errors ? How to improve it ?

How being more efficient with my lower left "invading" group ?
Thx !!

Hello, 

I'm Andreas. around 13k or somesuch. I try to give you some pointers, though it's quite hard in that game, as black wasn't a real challenge at all for you.

I hope the comments help a little and feel free to contact me at: cadellin@dragoncairn.net if you have questions.

Winning the game basically was a question to defend the lead you got in the beginning till the end.

I noticed some points in the endgame, where it seems you are to focused at a certain area then look at the whole board.

1. If you have a wall and you get an invasion. You use the wall by pushing the opponent against it.

2. Consider the direction of your play. Do not force the enemy to run into your potention territory.

3. No second line plays in the early stages.

But all in all, very well played.];B[dd]C[gct [21k\]: hi :)]
;W[pp]C[Taucetil [?\]: hi !];B[nq]C[Odd. to approach the corner now. Black usually wants to have a stone around D4 for that.]
;W[qn];B[lp]LB[qk:B][np:2][oq:1][qq:A]C[What's the intention of your next move at 1 ? Expected black to answer at 2 with really bad shape ?

Your two stones are fine. You got either A or B to settle. Trying to secure the corner now is to early and small.]
;W[oq]C[Touching isn't good either just makes plack stronger.]
;B[or];W[pr]C[Playing on the second line is considerer bad so early in the game.]
;B[mr];W[np];B[mp];W[no]C[I guess O5 isn't bad in that situation and white got away better in that corner. Black has sente though.]

;B[nc]
(;W[ld]LB[ne:1]SQ[md][nd][od][ln][mn][nn][on][pn]C[What's the intention of this one ? Usually black will jump to o 15 now and you rather would like to build a wall that works with your lower group]

[pk][jl][ll][nl][no][oo][po][qo]C[Disaster for black. White comes out with a big wall and black has nothing at all in return. Well his group is alive. That's about it.

Basically I woudl go for a big mojo strategy for the game from there.]
;B[dj]
(;W[ep]LB[cc:A][cg:B][cm:C][ln:1][ep:F][eq:E][iq:D]C[Nope. this is to early. Why not just threaten to crush black with building a really big framework.

Black doesn't have much and there are lots of invasion points. It's a matter of style I know but 1 is really asking black a big question what he's gonna do.]

Well that was kind of a success, that increased your wall. Locally the gain was small with 4 more points, while the middle is still open.]
;B[mn]TR[fg][fi][ii][ji][li][nl][ol][nm][om]C[Akward, but how much does it cost, but where can you make most territory now.

Not sure how to get most out of it though.

You are really really stong now here so the protection at o10 isn't necessairy.]
