C[WOG: I'll preface my comments with WOG.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[fq];W[po];B[np]C[WOG: Normally, with so many friends around, you can pincer this stone.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[pl]C[A modern variation !?
(LL)

WOG: This is not unheard of. A tewari analysis of this is like you pincered and he attached at the 3-3.]
;W[rr];B[pr];W[ql]C[WOG: This isn't great for White. Small territory and gives Black outside influence.]
;B[qk];W[qm];B[pk];W[dn];B[ip]C[WOG: This move is for outside influence. If you wanted to coordinate the territory, you could play at k3.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]LB[cf:B][ko:A]C[which point is most urgent : A or B ???
(LL)

WOG: A is not urgent at all. It's a one meaning move. At the beginning of the game, you want your stones to affect as many things as possible. The move at A merely is endgame and a small protect against a White move at M4 or so.

B is much more active and has more options for the board. With A, you're investing a ton of moves to get a small portion of the board.]
;B[ko];W[cf]TR[dc][hc][me][cl][fo]C[what is the good direction ???
(LL)

WOG: IMHO, White is ahead now.

Of the choices you've outlined, the question should be answered by an analysis of the positions. The move at f5 shouldn't be a consideration. You've already over invested in this area. A move at N15 believes that the moyo Black creates is bigger than the corner and side territory that White can build. It's a narrow moyo. So, I'd go with one of the other choices.]
;B[cl]C[WOG: With the backing of your over investment beneath of stones, this invasion seems well supported.]
;W[cj];B[el];W[go];B[gp];W[gm];B[ej];W[ci]C[WOG: Move 32 is an enabler for the double peep of your connection.]
;B[bn]C[perhaps/probably a mistake !?
(LL)

WOG: It's not a mistake to ignore the double peep. It's a choice. Your analysis has to be whether ignore the cutting of White makes sense.]
;W[dk]C[tesuji !
!
(LL)

WOG: Not a tesuji. Just White's right after playing at c11.]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[fl];W[gj];B[gl]C[WOG: This seems fine for Black. White is hurting in the corner.]
;W[bo];B[co];W[bp];B[cn];W[cp];B[fo]C[WOG: Black is good here. Yes, White got influence up above, but your moves have negated a number of White moves and White needs to respond in the corner where plays have no future potential.]
;W[er]TR[eb][hc][me][hk][fr]C[I still doesn't know what is the best direction !?
(LL)

WOG: D and E seem like very limited options, more like endgame since D leaves the backdoor open.

A is going back to the moyo which now with more of the board resolved may be possible. B and C are possible if you think the moyo isn't enough.]

(;B[me]C[black wants to play at the frontier...
(LL)

WOG: Your analysis should be that the moyo is bigger than White capturing the corner and side.]
;W[ld];B[kf];W[nn]C[WOG: This isn't really eliminating or dealing with the moyo. White is playing dame to reduce the side?]
;B[mo]C[WOG: This seems too small too];W[mm]C[WOG: Why is White creeping along in the middle... not gaining territory, not really invading the moyo or reducing it??]
;B[mk]C[WOG: With this move, Black says, "go ahead and take your dame."]
;W[km];B[if]C[WOG: Again, the analysis needs to be, is this bigger? Giving up the fourth line territory to gain what?]
;W[hd]TR[pb][gf][jj][cc][dc]C[and now ???
(LL)

WOG: With moves 53 and 55, it seems like the proper follow up would be either the move at k10, or a move at b. Otherwise, why were you trading off center moves for side moves? 

If the analysis was wrong for why to play 53 and 55, then it's not too late to start playing right and play to reduce the corner, at say, b.]

(;B[gf]C[black reduces, but helps white to reinforce his own position...
(LL)

WOG: While 57 does reduce White's potential, the corner potential seems more real.]
;W[ec];B[pb];W[mg]TR[mf][lf][lg][lh]C[diffilcult to find a good answer fro black !?
(LL)

WOG: Here, you want to make White heavy if possible, capture if you can, but if neither, you should extract some territory from White if you can't.]
;B[lh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qf]C[WOG: White is keeping things light. That's good for White.]
;B[qe];W[mj];B[lk]C[WOG: This way is rather aggressive. Pulling back, you can carve off some territory, but otherwise, you're rather forced to try to consume all of White.

That said, there is an effect on the White stones at l7, n7, and o6.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[lj];B[nj];W[ni];B[ok]C[WOG: Now, there's an opportunity to cut find pressure against the White stones below.]
;W[kh];B[lg];W[li];B[mh];W[mi]
(;B[jj]C[WOG: Move 79 invites White to make a tiger's mouth and get out.]
;W[ji];B[ij];W[hh];B[he]C[WOG: Why make this exchange unless you can cut off White somehow?]
;W[gd];B[kj];W[ki];B[hk]C[WOG: Not sure sealing here helps much as White still has problems here.]
;W[fh];B[mn];W[nm];B[lm];W[pi];B[ri]C[WOG: Might be better to play around r13 on this side. Also, there's moves like o18, e14, f2, s1 that make more sense for Black]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[oj];B[nk];W[rh];B[rk];W[sl];B[oh];W[oi];B[ll]
C[WOG: This move seems a bit chicken. Is White going to be able to cut off these Black and kill them?]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[rf];B[re];W[md];B[eq]C[WOG: D5 seems bigger.]
