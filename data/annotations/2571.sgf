AB[dp][pd]C[Hi, thanks to whoever is reviewing this for your time. I am playing black against a 22 kyu white player. This was a close game up to the point where white resigned upon making a really bad move in a fairly important area.

Cheers,
my name is Peter Strempel, I play somewhere around 8k. I'm glad to do a review for you. :)
If you have some questions left, feel free to contact me on KGS, you find me there as 'cron'.]
;W[pp];B[dd]C[First move, and the first one I'm not sure about :) In a 2 stone handicap game, is it better to place this stone on the 3-4 point rather than the 4-4 point to get territory, rather than ending up with 3 stones on hoshi?

There is no reason to worry about this move. 4-4 is good here. You can also consider 4-3, 5-4 or 5-3, which are all common corner openings. 4-4 is as good as the others, at least for my lowly kyu level knowledge. After all, it is a matter of style. 4-4 aims for influence, which is good for a handicap game, if you know how to use it properly (which is difficult).]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[cf];B[fd]C[Not sure about this move, would it have been better played at D14 or somewhere else along left side, rather than along the top (since I played along the top in the top-right corner last move)

No, this is allright. These moves are calm, and if you can later get K16 or K16, the top side will look good.
Also note that white omits the follow-up moves of the corner approach, so you can attack that later.
I dislike D14 here, it only helps White to settle his group. I will explain that later in the lower left corner in detail.
So far your moves are good, nothing to worry about.];W[fq];B[fp]
LB[gp:A]C[I don't like this. Usually white will be able to settle his group easily after this attachment, while black does not get so much out of it.
I will show two of the common variations, white normally plays (A) next.]

(;W[dq]C[This is unusual.];B[ep];W[eq]
(;B[nq]SQ[cq][gq]TR[cp][gp]C[Ah, you missed a chance here to seal white into the corner!
Please see the variation.

It will make a huge difference if black plays first the hane at the squares, or white the hane at the triangles.
You should not ignore this now.];W[np];B[mp]C[Right, I see you know this sequence better then white :)]
;W[oq];B[no];W[op];B[mq]LB[nr:A]C[(A) is also possible.];W[pj]
;B[pm]LB[cq:A]C[You should play the previously shown sequence starting at (A), see earlier variations.]
;W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[mo]C[Bad move, that O5 stone is not important. Rather get your stone P7 stones out.]
;W[pn];B[nm];W[mn];B[qn];W[ql];B[qm];W[mm];B[nk];W[dj];B[cl]
C[Good, white should not have played on the 4th line here, as it leaves black this move.]

(;W[jd]C[Actually, that K16 is not so good. Instead White would normally invade on the 3rd line to make life quickly. See variation.]
;B[jc]C[Is this ok? In trying to secure territory at the top, I allow white to create a large wall. Is this worth it for the amount of territory I end up claiming?

This is a very bad move.
In general, if you attach on a single opponents stone, you will only help your opponent to get stronger. But as white has played within your sphere of influence, you do not want to help him getting stronger, instead attack from some distance and while white needs to run away you build up some precious territory.

And your K17 does not make any territory at all. It only assists white to get away with this invasion.]

(;W[hd]
(;B[hc]C[Not good. J17 is better as it hits the vital point, the point white would want to play to get good shape.]

(;W[ld];B[lc]
(;W[nf]LB[ic:B][kc:A]C[White is too soft on your. He should start to wedge between at A or B.
You cannot attach like this from below, after either White A or B Black will crumble.]

(;B[ip]C[What does this move do?

You play high (4th line) if you aim for influence, low (3rd line) if you aim for territory.
As white can play something like H2 or H2, you won't get much here.
And as mentioned earlier, attacking the D3-F3 stones is still possible.

Also note that you have a weak group on the right side, which certainly demands more attention than your stones on the bottom.
Consider a white move at N8, the vital point for blacks shape.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[qd];B[qc];W[cd];B[cc];W[ff];B[df]C[What does this move do?
Again, you only help white to get stronger. And your 3rd line stones on H17, K17 and M17 are still doomed to crumble if you dont protect there soon.

Occasionally it is good to lean back and observe the board without the mouse in your fingers.

You have a weak group on the right side. You have a problem on the top.
White currently has no weakish group on the board you could attack. So it is time to do some defensive maneuvers which would secure you some points.
Consider something like the wedge at J16, which defends your top and creates a weakness in whites shape.
Or, as white missed the followup moves of R16 and C16, capture these stones and get a huge corner.
Or play something like N8 to help your weak group on the right.
There are quite urgent moves on the board, so no need to help white to make his left side group strong, which had until now been the only white group with
a little weak shape.];W[dg];B[de];W[ce]C[Did this help you now?

No way, you only helped your opponent, as white now got his shape fixed up and threatens to play B17 next gobbling up your corner territory.]

;B[eb];W[ea];B[da]C[This move was horrible, I acted instinctively to the play on edge rather than thinking it through.

Agreed. :)];W[ec];B[fa];W[db];B[ea];W[ga];B[gb]C[Well seen, however you might want to leave it for later, your Q7 group needs urgent attention]
;W[ca];B[fc];W[dc];B[bd];W[bc];B[be];W[cb];B[ac]
(;W[bb]C[Bad move by white, E19 and he lives.]
(;B[ab]LB[ea:A]C[E19 (A) kills. A18 does not. See variation.]

(;W[cp];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[cr]C[I think it should turn obvious now that you missed an important move here earlier by not playing C3.
Compare this result with the earlier variations starting at C3, and you easily see why you should not have missed it.]

;B[mf];W[ne];B[md];W[le];B[mg];W[lg];B[ie]LB[mi:C][ng:A][ni:B]
C[A, B or C would finally connect your stones at O9. A white move at (B) looks bad, as it cuts your right side stones off.

Also, what does J15 do? You play a peep,  but in fact you destroy some potential for later.
Also you violate the concept of a peep, see comments in few moves.]
;W[id];B[if];W[hg];B[kc];W[ic];B[ib];W[kd];B[jg]C[Allright. Some moves before I wrote that you violate the concept of a peep.
Sounds mean, so what is the concept of a peep?

A peep is a forcing move which is usually answered by your opponent, and you will treat that forcing stone lightly. Read: Sacrifice it if necassary. You don't lose something, as your opponent had answered your move earlier, so you got that forcing move for free, both in terms of sente and points.
What you would *not* do with a forcing move is to add further stones and make it heavy (in opposite to treating it lightly aka throw it away maybe).
So what are you doing right now?
a) You create a weak group for yourself. Now you have three stones where you started with one stone as a peep. Three stones are too much to sacrifice. One stone you could have sacrificed.
b) Look how white fixed up his shape. Compare with whites weak shape few moves before, your three stones, which are a burden for you now, have helped white extremely much.

To sum it up, your last moves hurt you and helped white. It would have been better to pass. That had only hurt you, at least not helped white.
Sorry for being so mean, but this is an important concept which is difficult to understand for beginners, to treat forcing moves lightly, so I say it bluntly in the hope you will remember. :)]

Thanks for the review :)

Ah well, I think if he had protected, it had not helped either.
Well, if he captures the 7 stones with K14 next, the loss on the right side is too big. So resigning was probably appropriate.

I hope you can get something out of this review. :)])
