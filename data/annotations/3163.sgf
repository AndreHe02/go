;B[qd]C[I am not strong in fuseki

hartz: Hi, I will try to help you to spot stronger moves but I am only 4k so dont take my advice as the "only" move.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[kc]
(;B[fq]C[hartz: this is the first move i dont like.

I think that h17 extending from your corner enclosure is better.
r6 or c6 are also better in my opinion.

Look at the variation];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[od];B[pf];W[qj]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[nq]C[hartz: o2 is not a bad move but as j3 is low and o3 is also low is not urgent.

Moves that i like more are j17, c8 or r12];W[pn];B[cj]C[Hartz: c10 is a good extension but in the wrong direction. Always try to extended in front of your corner enclosure or shimari. J17 also threat to invade severely at n17 so it is also sente, keeps the iniciative.

If you want to play at the left side, i think you should go to c8 threating to play c2 later and getting white corner under attack.]
;W[hc]C[Hartz: Very good move !!!];B[ej]C[Hartz: this is not a bad move but it is not so good because it is not in the good side of the corner enclosure, so it doesnt  take the most territory.]
;W[ee];B[dg];W[qh]C[Hartz: Another good point taken by white again.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[mo]C[hartz: this is a good secuence for black :)]
;B[lp];W[rf]C[hartz: white takes some points WHILE attacking. Good !!!]
;B[re]C[I tihnk it's a mistake

Hartz: I think it is the proper move for defending the corner. The problem came for not playing at r12 before. In fact q14 is almost a wasted move.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[It is bad too - empty triangle

hartz: not sure about this move. It is an empty triangle but i dont see anything better.]
;W[pg]C[hartz: i think white loses a good opportuny here. I would have cut at q15 instead of q13 because black corner is quite weak]
;B[md]C[Here i don't know where to play, i think it is not a good move

hartz: black corner is weak so i think it is not time for invading but for defending. P18 or q18 is mandatory.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[ke];B[kf]C[hartz: I dont like l14 because black has a weak point at n15 and l14 dont defend it. I would have played at m13, keeping white divided while escaping in the center.]
;W[le];B[lf]C[hartz: it is much better to connect at n15. This way white gets a lot of points]
;W[me];B[ne];W[oe];B[ng];W[of];B[je];W[jd];B[if];W[mg]
(;B[lg]C[hartz: this is the losing move. You simply cant give white 7 line territory. It is HUGE. 

I think you should fight and rescue o13 stone. Look at the variation.]
;W[mh];B[lh]C[hartz: this is slow. Think about jumping to l11 to get an advantage. While running try to get ahead of your opponent !]
;W[mi]C[hartz: after the n13 secuence i think the game is lost but the only way I see to try to come back is something like q9 or r8. Look at the variation]

(;B[fg];W[fc]C[hartz: this another good point taken by white.]
;B[li]C[hartz: again very small and slow. Think about jumping first and if it doesnt works then extend]
;W[lj]C[hartz: White is playing too agresively here. you should cut. Look at variation]

(;B[kj];W[lk];B[kk];W[ll];B[op];W[oo];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[so]
;B[no]C[hartz: this is a good move but it is gote, you lose the iniciative, so it is important to  another moves first. For example, q18, c8, t14.]
;W[nn];B[np];W[dk];B[ek]C[hartz: e9 show a good fighting spirit but in my opinion is better to connect at d10. White doesnt have any good continuation and black gets some points and a strong position.]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[jk]
(;B[jj]C[hartz: same position as before and same mistake. You should extend at j8. Look at variation.]

Final commentary:

You play quite well a territory oriented game but , in my opinion, you should improve at fighting because you retreat when you should attack. Another important point for improving is at keeping the iniciative because you have lost it many times. Another point is to improve at head to head runs. Try to jump ahead, not only extend.

I think you style would improve much if you try to fight more at your games. Maybe you will lose big at the first games but you should fight more and better.]
