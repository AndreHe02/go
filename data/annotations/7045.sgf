C[C: Hi, I'm around 7k in strength and I'll be commenting on the game. I'll mark my comments with a "C" so you know it's me. Since you're playing as white, I'll mostly stick to white's moves, but I'll also comment on black's move so you get an idea of what you're opponent might be thinking.

I was white.

This game ended up being pretty close. I made a couple mistakes in the beginning that I think could have given me an easy victory. I'd like to know what these mistakes are and how I could have played them better.

Towards the end, I think I was still ahead a bit, but must have made a few endgame mistakes that pushed him in the lead. Could you help me with this, too?

Thank you very much];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[oq]C[C: This kind of early approach is Shusaku's Fuseki, so it's a perfectly legitimate move, albeit aggressive. One small note though, in this specific position, you should definitely know some joseki and theory for the 5-3 point. Because black opened with hoshi on the first move, if he plays hoshi again on the fourth corner, you would have to follow up with a second move on the bottom right. This would end up as if you played the corner on 5-3 and black approached. This is because Shusaku's Fuseki involving two approaches is usually for two komoku corners. This isn't a bad move, but just something to keep in mind.

I think this might be jumping the gun? I figured I'd try it out, I'm just starting to learn about fuseki.]
;B[op]C[C: Black gets nervous, it is better to take the last corner.]
;W[np];B[pq]C[C: This move is incorrect, the proper continuation for black is at P5.]

(;W[no]C[C: This move should be atari at P5, see the variation.]
;B[oo];W[dp];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[ci]C[C: Should be at C10 instead.]
;W[cl]C[C: You're right, his shape is overcrowded. However, don't worry too much about "punishing" him right away for such a mistake. The move you played is fine. Normally, if black had played the correct move at C10, he would stabilize his group with the one point jup at E10. But, that's not possible with the move at C11, so black's outline is much smaller.

Was this too far away? His shape is overcrowded, I think, but I'm not sure how to punish him without making myself spread apart too weak.]
;B[hq]C[C: Should be at F3, black doesn't have to worry about the wall yet.]
;W[fq];B[mq]C[C: Very big mistake by black! He must cut directly at O3, this is a "thank you" move.]
;W[nq];B[kq];W[on];B[qn];W[nc]C[C: The approach is from the wrong side. F17 is low, so the top is uninteresting for you. If you wanted to approach on the top, the high approach at O16 might be better.]
;B[lc];W[ne]C[C: Probably better to play on R17, as black can't take advantage of a wall in either direction, because of F17 and R6 respectively.]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[C: The normal joseki move is L16, creating the wall, which is the aim of the O15 sequence.

I don't think this is right];B[le];W[ng];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[qh]
C[C: A bit of an overplay. It is difficult to invade the right when your group is still weak.]
;B[nb];W[ql]C[C: Again, slight overplay. Black's group is strong, so the two point jump at R9 is safer. Also, you're playing from the wrong side, as your O3 group is not completely safe.]
;B[pm];W[pl];B[nn];W[lo]C[C: Should start from the atari at N6 and sacrifice the stone.]
;B[om];W[mn]C[C: Black let's you get away with it.];B[nm]
(;W[nk]C[C: Note the tesuji starting from M3. With that fun little sequence out of the way, there are some realistically more important moves on the board. Number one is connecting your weak group directly. O11 is more practical here, as your R8 group already has a base, and therefore isn't in immediate danger. Second, the one point jump at E8 is a big move, as it protects against an invasion in the lower left and is sente, in that black should respond with E11. If he doesn't, you can completely restrict development for black on the left, which has the nice side-effect of relaxing the pressure your feeling on the right with a nice wall.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[en];W[gn]C[C: Again, the cap is an overplay, you need to save C8.]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[ck];W[dj];B[cj];W[el];B[dm];W[fj]C[C: That was a lot of territory to give up.]
;B[jo];W[jm]C[C: It really seems like you play the cap too much. The cap is a move you use to keep up the pressure on a weak group and force it to continue running. However, none of the groups you've capped were weak, so it ends up stretching your own groups out. One thing to note is that in even strength games, it's generally hard to create territory in the center unless it's your plan from the very start. In this position, black's groups are all relatively strong. Because this game developed somewhat passively, you could say this is already the start of the endgame. Your focus now should be to enlarge your framework in the center where you can, stabilize your O15 group, and then start grabbing the big endgame moves.

In no particular order, some of the points you want to keep an eye on are K18, S14, S7, G2, B5 and O11.]
;B[mm];W[kn];B[lp];W[kb]C[C: Better at K18.];B[mc];W[md]C[C: Better to play P15 directly.]
;B[ld];W[oe];B[pe];W[rf];B[ph];W[pi];B[qg];W[rh];B[re];W[oh]
;B[rg]C[C: Black decides to give you a very nice shape.];W[pg]
;B[sf];W[fe]C[C: A very big point.];B[mk];W[mj];B[lk];W[jj]
C[C: This move is too small. Again, remember that not many points come from the center. Here, your outline isn't too big to begin with and black has two ways in. There are two sente moves at G2 and S7.]
;B[lg];W[jg]C[C: See previous comments. Although, I'm not sure why black played M13. K13 could enlarge your territory on the top.

I was thinking I could use his running positions on both sides to give me the remaining territory in the center?]
;B[lj];W[mi];B[eh];W[gh]C[C: Black plays passively and you end up with a decent outline in the center.]
;B[jk];W[ik]C[C: Extension at J10 might be better here.];B[jl]

;W[ig];B[ji];W[ii];B[kj];W[kh]C[C: Small move, better reserved for an endgame ko threat. The big moves are at B5, G2, and S7.]
;B[ki]C[C: Mistake by black. The much bigger sente moves at B5, G2, and S7 are still there.]

(;W[ip]C[C: Aji-keshi! G2 must come first. In fact, looking through the entire game, I would identify the J3 as the losing move. A play at G2 here instead would have easily made up the final score difference.]

Click on a group of stones to mark it dead and remove it from the board.]
;B[tt]C[C: Okay, to sum up, the two big things I noticed in your play.

First is your habit of capping strong groups the moment they go to the sixth line. When you consider these aggressive kind of moves, you should always consider the purpose behind playing it. Are you trying to stop the group from getting into the center? If so, why? If the group has no base and is trying to survive, then capping it could put a lot of pressure on your opponent. If the group already has a base and the jump is just a framework extension, then a cap doesn't really do anything, except put a stone in the middle of the board that may not even have support. Again, just keep in mind that territory in the center tends to be easily reduced.

The second thing, and definitely the most serious, is your endgame. Both you and your opponent in this game consistently missed the big endgame moves as you fought for chunks of 3-4 points in the center. I know this sounds harsh, but that's just how important it is. Remeber the big endgame points are usually on the side, are on the boundary between two outlines, and are sente. I pointed out the big ones in this game. Try to go through your old games and maybe some pro games and try to spot the big endgame moves before they're played. After a while, you kind of get a more natural feel for it. I think a mentality a lot of people get into is that by the endgame, all the important moves have been played and what's done is done. This is NOT the case, the endgame can easily swing the game by 20 points or more if one player gets and keeps sente. As an example, if you had taken B5 and G2 in this game, you would've won by around 15 points, and this is taking into account losing the moves you played instead. Remember, it's never too early to consider endgame moves. Keep an eye on them, and when you find yourself considering fighting around in the center for small points, that's the time to grab them. Improving your endgame would probably net you two stones in strength, if not more.]
