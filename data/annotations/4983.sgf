C[Dear Reviewer,

I am playing white here. In this game, a big fight broke out after P6 (move 31). I'd appreciate your comments on this fight.

could you comment also on

- direction of play
- various joseki alternatives for upper right corner...

Thank you!];B[pd]C[unstable [2k\]: hi again];W[qp]C[kittykatty [2k\]: hi again]

(;W[of]C[In this variation of the corner joseki, white opts for outside influence. Perhaps not the best of choices in this case because you are in direct competition with black, who set up for development of influence and moyo with the 3-star opening; also, the 3-4 points are generally precursors to more territory-oriented developments. If you really didn't want to play at R17, perhaps Q12 would have been a better option.]

C[This move is a no-no. You are pushing your opponent along, and he's always one move ahead of you. You could've moved ahead by playing at P7.]

(;B[rk];W[qn];B[on];W[mm]C[This is one of the moves that looks clever but really isn't. I too learned this the hard way. You are not really sealing him in any more than he already was, and he has a back door which neither of you saw...consider black R5...]

;W[qo];B[mn];W[ln];B[mo]
(;W[km]C[the stone at N7 is still "soft", vulnerable to atari after black play O7; M7 would have been more solid. Besides, white wall is solid enough that this is not really needed. Perhaps O4 would have been better?]
;B[pq];W[oo]C[If I were black at this point, I would have played at P4.]

(;B[nm];W[oq];B[ml];W[lm];B[nk];W[mj]C[If you insist on killing, then you really have no choice. But the black group doesn't look too killable at this moment.]

;B[lj];W[li];B[jj];W[ki];B[hj];W[gi];B[gm];W[ld]C[The territory up there is worth 12 points, max. There are much larger places on the board, such as the lower corner (maybe G4?) because if he goes down, your group has no eyes.]

(;B[me]C[Stupid move, really; he can't kill your stone with your thick wall up there.]
