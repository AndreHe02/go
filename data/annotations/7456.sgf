C[methanol [2k\]: hi

Chris: It seems the reason you lost was greed. Do not start weak groups everywhere because you are afraid of your opponents terretory. Two mindsets might help your game:

1) Aim to win in endgame. This way you may play more solidly, aiming for big reductions later. If your opponents make mistakes you can still kill ;)
2) Look where you can build terretory/moyos yourself rather than only look at what your opponent is doing

Of course better reading helps at any level :)

If you have questions feel free to email me.

(;B[ch]LB[cf:A][cj:B]C[Did black overreach here for settling on the left.  Should I counter immediately.   Many large spots on the board and its hard for me to decide.

Chris: I would immediatedly play A. There is not a good way for Black to respond. It feels like Black should have played at B to move out into the centre with better shape.]

(;W[oq]LB[nc:B][cf:C][jr:A]C[Chris: Wrong direction. 
1) Since the A stone is low, the bottom side is not really developable.
2) It is a narrow part on the board.
3) A will be looking at the base of any white group there making it weaker.

B or C are better options];B[po]C[Chris: This is a good response by black. Maybe white should abandon the stone for the moment and wait for a better chance later]
