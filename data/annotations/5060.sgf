C[Hi, I'm shmolex and I'll be reviewing your game.  I will precede my comments with an S.  You asked about fuseki and invading points, so that's what I'll focus my review on.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[op];W[dc];B[df];W[ch]
(;B[dh]C[S: The standard joseki would be at c15 or d16.  The way this variation turned out allows white to fully use it's 4-4 stone well.  See variation for joseki.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[cg];B[cf];W[cl];B[fd];W[fb];B[ec]C[S: Bad move.  Dont push unless you are going to cut.  since you cant cut at d18, you shouldn't play e17.  All you do is force white to connect, and waste a good ko threat.]
;W[eb];B[dd];W[fc];B[ed];W[cc]
(;B[dn]C[is this good invanding point?

S:  well, this is more of a reduction than an invasion.  If you want to reduce, this is a good move, but now is not the time for reduction.  White can't secure this territory with 1 move, so you have time to play somewhere else and still come back and reduce later.  There are bigger points on the board.  See variations.]
;W[co];B[cm];W[cn]C[S: If white wants to connect, the correct move is b7.  This turned out quite good for black.]

(;B[fj]C[S: This should be at f9.  No sense in leaving a huge cutting point.  See variation.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[ej];B[fk];W[gd]
(;B[ge]C[S: Black can kill white with b11, but I guess this is pretty big too.]
;W[hd];B[he];W[id]
(;B[mc]C[S: This is slow.  It should be 1 line farther as that also threatens to undercut white.  See variation]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[fg];B[ef];W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig];W[ih];B[if]
;W[jq]
(;B[gq]C[and is this good move? I think that white could kill it.

S: Part of getting stronger is being able to determine when to invade and when to reduce.  Take a look at the situation on the board.  

Black has:
About 15 points in the f13 area, 
15 points or so in the upper right corner
about 15 points in the center
and 1 corner in which you have sole influence.
Thats about 45 points and 1 undeveloped corner not to mention that the top and center have a lot of room to expand.

White has:

About 15 points in the top and upper left corner
About 10 in the lower right
That's about it.

Black is well ahead, so there is no need to risk a failed invasion.  A reduction is more than enough here and less risky.  Now if you were losing, then g3 would be a good invading move.  White doesn't really have a chance to kill it since there are many ways for it to escape.]

(;B[go]C[S: This should be at g6, and I think white showed you why.]

S: A safe extension at r7 is good.  No need to play on the 4th line here.  However....]

[qs][rs][ss]C[S:  Overall, it was a very well played game for black, especially since white is supposedly 3 stones stronger.  The only real big mistake was in the r7 area that let white get that large chunk of terriroty on the right.  The only thing I would suggest that you work on is deciding when to invade and when to reduce.  Although it may not look like it, reducing usually is worth as much as an invasion.
