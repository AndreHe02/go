;B[qd]C[Hi,thanks for your time.
I played against someone around 2-4d,my main questions are about my fuseki and life and death in this game.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[ep];B[oc];W[qj];B[cp];W[dn];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq]
;W[gp];B[ce];W[ch]LB[cg:D][bn:C][bo:B][nq:A]C[reid: Hello Andrey.  I'd like to start here.  This pincer is questionable since white is open on the left side (under the D6 stone).  I think it is more natural to switch to A instead.  Alternatively, white can force with B or C first.  If black answers, then the pincer is OK (although I think a closer attack with D would be better).  It is important to think about how your stones work together as early as possible in the game.  If they don't work well now, it is difficult to make the game come together.]
;B[ed]C[reid: Since C12 is not severe, black could also slide to A.  This is very big reverse-sente move, and it makes it difficult for the white stones to work together.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[cb]C[i wasnt sure what is the best respond]
;B[cd];W[hc]LB[bb:E][eb:D][fb:B][gb:C][fc:A][gd:F][qn:G][nq:H]
C[reid: This move looks very slow.  I understand that white wants to prevent ladder after  the push and cut (black A, white B, black C), but white needs to think of something more active.  For example, white D prevents the cut and also makes black E gote.  This helps keep black unsettled.  White F would also be better thank H17.

White could also consider extending to A and allowing the ladder (white D after black C, then black H17).  Black gets a nice ladder breaker at G and after black takes the G17 stone, white gets a double approach with H.]
;B[bb]C[reid: black gets the critical move for eye-shape.];W[bo]
;B[bp];W[da]LB[db:A]C[small?

reid: Not small, because again, it is critical for eye-shape.  But connecting sollidly (A) is better shape (as you find out much later).]
;B[qh];W[qm];B[mq];W[kq]LB[qq:A]C[reid: In the US, we have a saying about closing the barn door after the horses have already escaped.  It feels like white is following black around the board. 

Invading at the 3-3 (A) would be one way to stir things up a bit.]
;B[qo]C[reid: So now black has three and a half corners.  White has very little.  White needs some drastic plan to get back into the game.]
;W[oj]LB[ba:A]C[reid: This is too defensive, particularly when white is behind.  Instead, white should hane at A (B19) and attack this group severely.]
;B[cj]C[reid: Black is looking for trouble.  With the C16 stones not really settled yet, black doesn't have time for this invasion.  He also doesn't need it as he is ahead in territory.]
;W[eh]C[reid: White's natural response becomes a great splitting attack.]
;B[ej];W[gh];B[gj];W[ii]C[seems like i didnt gain much from this attack

reid: I don't agree.  I think white now has a chance (where he didn't just a few moves ago).  Black's groups on both sides are not alive.  These white stones have a very nice splitting attack going.]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[ik];W[ji]C[reid: However, I think this move is a problem.  More interesting would be to hane at B19 now..  If black cuts at K11, white simply pulls back at J13.  Black will have a very hard time keeping all his stones alive.  In the meantime, white should be able to get very strong in preperation for invading the upper right corner.]
;B[ba]C[reid: With one move, black changes the whole picture.  Now one of the two groups is alive and white must make a full-out efffort to kill the center group.]
;W[fk]C[reid: Be careful of peeping like this.  After black connects, the white C12-E12-H12 chain might be too weak to keep black enclosed.]
;B[fj];W[dk];B[di]C[reid: This is a very bad peep by white.  I'll explain why in a few moves.  Black should simply connect instead.]
;W[dh];B[ck];W[dl];B[dj]C[reid: Black still needs to connect with D10.  So now, the exchange of black D11 for white D12 is obviously very bad.  Perhaps black could have exploited the weak white chain if he had not made this exchange]
;W[km]LB[mo:C][kp:E][mp:A][np:B][lq:D]C[reid: I would prefer to make a leaning attack now.  The black dragon really has nowhere to go and making eyes could be very difficult.  I would like to see white play A to see how black responds.  The normal response of black B, white C, black D, white E looks very nice for white and black looks even worse off than before.]
;B[im];W[jl];B[gk];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[el];W[il]C[reid: this cut is not worth very much if black gets to live in exchange.  I think white should save his F9 stone with F8 in response to black G9.  That would make it much harder for black to make eyes for his group.]

;W[ad];B[ae];W[ab];B[ca]C[reid: Here is where D19 at D18 would have been better shape for white.]
;W[bc];B[db];W[eb]C[no way to make something with blacks group?

I can't see anything.  Probably not playing B17 would be better,  Connect your stones as best you can in the F18 area instead, and hope to make a seki with black B17, white A17 later.  Seki would be 10 points better for white than this result.]
;B[ea];W[ga]C[reid: again, connecting at G19 is a little better.]

;B[ng];W[nf]C[i felt i was behind so had not choice but to play this

reid: Yes, black has all four corners.  White's center is not big enough to compensate.

My suggestion would be to work on the early part of the game.  Try to make a plan for getting all your stones to work together well.  Try not to let your opponent dictate the game - play your own game.

Good luck, play strong,
