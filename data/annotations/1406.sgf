PL[B];B[do];W[qd];B[op];W[cd]C[THIS LOOKS A LITTLE STRANGE TO ME.

BLACK IS LOOKING FOR INFLUENCE AND WHITE IS  PLAYING FOR A QUIET GAME.

Very interesting.];B[cj];W[pj]C[I would play at the 3-4 points in either bottom corner.

the 5-4 points invite playing 2 points under them at 3-4.

generally speaking, corners first
sides next, middle last.

It is usually better to approach the 3-4 points, 5-4 points, before  extending along the sides.

With thrdr 5-4 points you want to prevent black from enclosing the corner.

This move is certainly big, but you might be able to play  this after seeing blacks response to  your approach move.

This move is alot bigger after black has enclosed the lower right corner rather than the  lower left corner.

Again I am not particularly strong at fuseki, so take my advise as 10k advise.]
;B[ec]C[Looks good for black.

although I would try and play on the 4th line.];W[qo]
(;B[qq]C[This exchange looks better for black to me, now black has some good pressing moves on the lower right to build a wall by playing a shoulder hit move  at the 4-6 point.]

;W[ek];B[gi];W[cf];B[fk];W[dk]C[This looks risky on both sides especially with  huge moves on the top.]
;B[ck];W[dl];B[cl]C[black is forced to push  from behind here, making white stronger]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[dn];B[cn]C[but this looks good for black white]

;B[gp];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[iq];W[jp];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr]C[2nd line moves should be saved for end game they are too slow now]
;W[lq]C[White is trying to avoid being cut
and attacked, so this is ok for whilte.

Now,
The big move is in the middle of the upper side of the board, black has big flaws in his thickness up there and  white has yet to enclose the corner]
;B[lr]C[too slow, too small, black gets 2 points of territory and white can play the big moves up top]
;W[np]C[white puts pressure on black to stabilize his position, but this hurts the white stone in the lower left,

white shouldn't play  moves that hurts his own pieces.]
(;B[mq]C[?   black his helping white get strong on  the outside

this complicates the situation and  starts a fight.];W[mp];B[lp]
;W[kp]C[black needs to be careful,
he still has 3 cutting points in the upper right and white has a  clamping  move @ f18 to take advantage of

if black starts fights and white comes out ahead black is looking fragile.]

(;B[lo];W[nq];B[oq];W[mr]C[blacks cut is looking weak now];B[ko]
;W[jo]C[now blacks cut looks terrible,  black only has 3 liberties and white is almost connected.

this whole exchange has hurt blacks corner in the lower left.]

white is pretty happy];W[mm];B[lm];W[ll];B[pl]C[this is ok, but I would attack the lone white stone more firmly]
