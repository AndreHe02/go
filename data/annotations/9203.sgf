(;W[cf];B[eh];W[ql]C[how about this

- Way too fast!. There's a big open top side and the top right corner is unplayed. Why in such a rush to attack B? You end up playing the top right immediately afterwards, anyway. Why not leave the bottom right corner unplayed, in case another opportunity arises?]

Needlessly fancy. L16 stones aren't important at all. B only helps W get stronger by inducing W to connect at J16.]
;W[id];B[fg]C[B loses time here. He already let W jump out once at J13; this is his last chance to try and cap with J11.]

;B[eq];W[hr];B[hq];W[iq];B[gr];W[ef]C[How does this move help W? IN fact it hurts W by making the J15 dragon weaker.]
