 The game has W building huge thickness but not finding

something sufficiently devastating to do with it. Pretty soon

B has 3 solid territories amounting to 65 or 70 points and

white has no prospect of building something of that size.

So black just calmly plays sensible yose and wins.



Somewhere W has to find a way to stop that happening.



Both players show too much respect for each other, They

treat moves as sente which are (probably) not. I think that

most amateurs (myself included)  should seize the chance

of playing elswhere at the earliest opportunity.];B[pd]BL[292]
;W[cp]WL[298];B[pp]BL[281];W[dc]C[

Opening theory is not my strong point, but my way of thinking

is that asymetric points such as 3-4, 5-3  and 5-4 are usually

played with the expectation of getting in a follow up, forming

a shimari or whatever. Now W is always a move behind in the

opening so B is going to be able to find ways to stop this,

or reduce its value. So W, already needing way to gain the

initiative, is giving B more possiilities.



So *I* always play 4-4 with white. However, general wisdom is

that proving *any* opening bad is very hard to do, so if W

likes his way of playing then I wouldn't stop doing it.]WL[295]

Good, I think W keeps the initiative well with this.]WL[288]
;B[ce]BL[263];W[cg]TR[dn]LB[cj:a]C[

Good, a pincer seems the right idea. The choice of *which* pincer

is well beyond my strength, even with the joseki books beside

me.  So I think like:



The marked stone is high, so I'll play low.



We are going to get a stone somewhere around a,  that's a bit far

from the marked stone, so a slightly wider is pincer is better.



What I want is B straggling out and W making territoty around

him.]WL[281];B[ee]BL[260]

Too low, should be at a     This may seem a picky comment, but it's very fundamental. The

difference between 3rd and 4th line territory is crucial.  Having

got the two marked stones low W should be feeling a

need to get a 4th line stone in between.]WL[276];B[ci]LB[dh:a]

WL[272];B[cl]TR[ee][ce][fc]LB[bg:a]C[

But this is annoying.     However, the two marked stones have been neglected.



W's objective should be to attack these stones.  This would

be a lot easier if the marked W stone were higher, and that's

anothern reason why it's joseki.



The other problem is that B has a move at  a]BL[233]

Bad for B it is not urgent, he's already alive, and so is

W so he's playing yose with half the opening to finish.





Two choices.  Cover his weakness at the marked point, if W

plays there he makes strength and points. Or, play to

make sure W's thickness is reduced, probaby at a.]BL[208];W[cb]

I'm not convinced that B has to play in this area.     I suppose he's trying to defend in sente, but removing a liberty
