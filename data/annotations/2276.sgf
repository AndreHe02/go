C[This is my second game to be reviewed. Here I think I have a comfortable advantage in the beginning, but I don't know what happened, I started making fatal mistakes, and also played desperately towards the end. Again I would like to know my weaknesses in this game, and maybe if any, my strong points too.
And also, suppose I didn't make those fatal mistakes (indicated inside the file), would I have won the game?
Thank you very much for your help.

In general, black plays more loosely than white.  This gives black larger areas of less secure territory.  So, in the late opening and early midgame black seems far ahead.  Later in the midgame, however, white starts to exploit the weaknesses in black's positions and reduces them drastically.  Playing loose in the opening is generally a good idea.  At around move 20 I would rather be playing black than white, although neither player is in bad shape.  Black's major failing is not going back to strengthen and secure his loose positions before white attacks them.  Instead, black tends to try expanding further and further.  Remember, you only have to win by 1 point.  If you are ahead, then take time to secure what you have.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[cd];W[qq];B[ph]TR[fp][po][do][op]SQ[ec]C[This is rather small for the opening.  It isn't close enough to the upper right corner to really secure the corner.  It isn't really attacking anything either.  The square is good to secure the upper left corner.  The triangles are good approach moves. K4 would also be a reasonable choice.]
;W[ec];B[dc]TR[dg]SQ[hc]C[This is not a good choice.  It makes black too concentrated in the corner.  During the opening, your stones should make just a "rough sketch" of territory.  Black should either pincer around the square or extend down the left side around the triangle. BTW, when I say "around" a point I mean you could play either at or next to the marked spot.  When I say "at" a point, then I mean play at that specific spot.]
;W[co]SQ[do]C[White would do better at the square.  The resulting corner formation would be better for dominating the lower side than the current stones.]

(;B[cj]SQ[hc]C[This isn't bad, but there is a better option.  Since white did not respond to black's move in the upper left corner, the white stone there is very weak.  A pincer at the square would work well.  See the variation.]
;W[po];B[jp];W[ic]C[Now white is more secure here.];B[lc];W[fe]
;B[pm]SQ[qm]C[Playing at the square threatens to undercut white's lower right corner.  White would probably play another stone in the lower corner and leave black with sente.  During the opening, a good rule of thumb is to have half of your stones on the 4th line and half on the 3rd line.  Almost all opening moves should be on one of those two lines.]
;W[gq];B[np]SQ[mq]C[The square makes a more secure group for black.  Playing both stones here on the fourth line makes it harder for black to live on the side.  Thus, when making these moves black should be making plans to focus on the center.]
;W[cl]SQ[qc][qk][lq][cg]C[This is small.  White should invade at one of the squares.  C13 and M3 are probably the best choices right now.

Currently, white has smaller but more secure groups.  Black has a much larger area "sketched out" but not as securely.  So, at this time, black should be securing what he has while white should be attacking]
;B[dg]C[This secures the upper left side nicely.];W[qc]C[This area is still open enough that both white and black should expect white to live.  Black should not plan on killing.  Black should decide where he wants to build a wall while containing white.  The black stone at M17 is weaker than the black stones on the right side, so black's wall should face the upper side.]
;B[pc]C[This is the correct way to build a wall strengthening the stone at M17.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf]
(;W[pb]SQ[rf]C[White should play at the square before playing here.  See variation.]
;B[ob];W[qb];B[rf];W[se]SQ[sd]C[The square is better for white.]
;B[pa]TR[oc]SQ[le][rn]C[This is a small endgame move and should be saved until later. Particuarly since it is gote.  The squares are both better.  So is connecting at the triangle.  Remember, don't leave too many weaknesses behind.]
;W[qa];B[oa];W[qn]C[This is also small and merely forces black to secure the right side.  Try to avoid forcing your opponent to strengthen his position.]
;B[qm];W[or];B[sf];W[rd]SQ[rc]C[White should defend at the square.]
;B[sc];W[nq]C[By playing here, white must have decided that the stones in the upper right are dead.  If white thinks that they can live, then he should play there until they are settled.]

(;B[hq]C[See the variation for another way to defend here.  These stones are in a difficult position, so there is not excellent way to defend them.]
;W[lq];B[lp]C[Again, black is looking to the center with this move.]
;W[gp];B[mq]SQ[nn]C[This changes black's focus from the center to building eyes on the side.  Once you have decided on a general direction of play for a group, you should stick with it.  The square is better since it follows black's previous center emphasis and helps connect to the right side stones.]
;W[sd]C[White should not do this.  If white thought that this group could live he should have responded to black immediatly.  If he decided that this group was dead, then no further moves need to be played here ever.  The only exception would be to use this group for ko threats by threating to live.]

(;B[sb]C[See the variation for another possibility];W[rb]
(;B[sa]C[I think I did pretty well here to prevent W to make a living group on the top
left corner, is move 49 necessary? I keep telling myself that it's not, but
I could be wrong.

Also, is there any way I can kill that W group and get to move first afterward?

But, later on I made a very fatal mistake, which let those W group lived!

Move 49 is not absolutely necessary.  It does keep black from fighting a ko in the corner, so it may be worth the effort.  See the variation for details. I don't see a way to kill the group in Sente.  Killing in sente is very rare unless your opponent doesn't realize that the group is dead as soon as you do.]
;W[gm];B[mr]C[This strengthens black's group nicely.];W[jn]
;B[lm]TR[nr][hr]SQ[mn]C[This move seems to shift black's focus back to the center for this group.  Switching the focus back and forth is ineffective. The triangles are both sente moves that will strengthen black's lower side group.  Black should do these first.  Remember to secure what you have, particularly if you can do it in sente. Only then should black go back to playing out into the center. Once that time has come, the square is better locally since white will have a harder time cutting it off from the rest of black's stones.]
;W[on];B[nm]SQ[om]C[Black should connect solidly at the square.  Black should be trying to secure more territory on the right side.  So focus on keeping white out of that area.  The lower side black stones are on their own and should plan to live without any outside connections.  At move 142 black will wish that he had a stone at P7.]
;W[ln];B[nr];W[mo]
(;B[mp]SQ[oq]C[No, just capture at the square.  You don't always have to connect when your opponent peeps.  See variation]
;W[io];B[kf]TR[hr]SQ[ip]C[This is a fairly good way to expand black's territory.  M14 would actually be a bit better since it is more secure.  I think the lower side group still needs more strengthening first however. The square is a good response to white's last move.  The triangle should be a sente move for black and also strengthen this group.]
;W[pn]C[This move does nothing useful for white.]
(;B[rn]C[This move is gote for black.  Keeping sente is worth more.  See the variation.]
;W[ro];B[rm];W[ie];B[hg]SQ[kj]C[This doesn't surround any territory.  It also does a poor job of connecting over to black's left side group.  Connecting these groups is unnecessary anyway since both are strong.  The square surrounds territory better.]
;W[db]C[White plays a gote move similar to black's move at S6.]
;B[cb];W[da];B[ca];W[eb];B[ik]SQ[kj]C[This is too greedy and leaves room for white to reduce black's territory more.  The square is more solid.]
;W[gj];B[fg]SQ[om][kl][ii][kd]C[Again, don't bother trying to connect these groups.  The squares are all better to secure black's territory.]
;W[hk];B[ij];W[dj];B[ci];W[jl]C[Now white exploits black's greedy move.]
;B[jk]SQ[lk]C[Black should block around the square.  This would defend the right side better.]
;W[bk];B[nn]SQ[bj]C[Blocking white at the square is better.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[ck]SQ[ah]C[White should follow up on his move at B9 by making a monkey jump.]
;B[no];W[iq]C[Now white attacks the weaknesses left in this group.]

SQ[kl][jg]C[This doesn't change the score much at all.  Black still needs to defend his central area.  The squares are better.]
;W[jf]C[Again white exploits black's weaknesses.];B[jg]SQ[kg]
[ke]C[Either square is more solid and works better.];W[ke];B[le]
SQ[lf]C[The square is better.  Black is trying to hold on to too much. Accept that there are enough weaknesses here for white to reduce your territory and make an orderly retreat.]
;W[kg];B[lg];W[lf];B[kh]SQ[mf]C[The square defends the right side better.]
;W[nf];B[kf];W[mf];B[lo]TR[ld]SQ[nf][mf][lf]C[No, black needs to make sure the three white stones are cut off from any aid.  Connect at the triangle.  The white will take the ko at L13 and black will have to find a ko threat.  E2 and H18 are both good places for black to threaten white.]
;W[ld];B[me];W[md];B[ne];W[kc]SQ[nd]C[White should keep pushing at the square.]

(;B[mc]TR[lc]SQ[nd]C[Sacrifice the marked stone at play at the square.  See variation.]
;W[nc];B[nd]SQ[oc]C[No, Black must connect at the square instead or lose the corner.]
;W[nb];B[kd]C[MISTAKE!!! Here, I should have connect at P17, right?

Ow, man what a fatal mistake. =(

Yes black must connect at P17 here.  Actually, the connection should have been done earlier, but white hasn't cut until now.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[lb];B[je]SQ[nf][mf][lf]C[Good, this isolates the three white stones.]
;W[jc];B[mb]SQ[de][om][kl]C[Don't bother with this area.  It is lost.  Defend your remaining territory at one of the squares.]
;W[na]C[ARGHHHH!!! That hurts!];B[if]C[This is small.  Defend your main territory.]
;W[mh];B[mg];W[mj];B[of]TR[pe]SQ[kl]C[No, you have to keep white from connecting out through your loose side connections.  White can't cut at the triangle, so don't worry about this area for now.  The square is best.]
;W[ok];B[pk]SQ[om]C[No, again you must block white from connecting out.  Play at the square.]
;W[kk];B[kl];W[hi];B[ii];W[ol];B[kn]TR[ol][ok][kk][mj][mh]SQ[om]
C[No, play at the square.  The marked white stones have no eyes. The only way they can live is by connecting to a live white group outside of your area.  Black must prevent this at all costs. Currently, black is ahead by about 7 points including komi.  If white manages to connect the marked stones out, then white is ahead by around 14 points.  So, this move essentially decides the game.]
