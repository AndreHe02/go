would an invasion at e.g. m17/m16 maybe be a better idea than my continuation?"\]


I think Black is leading by a little bit. The two moves marked by triangles were mistakes on Black's part, but the white stones marked with squares are also bad shape, so now the question becomes: who will make best use of their opponent's bad shape ?]
(;B[qq]C[This feels a bit submissive. It does help protect the weaknesses in black's position a little, but I have the feeling it might not be enough.]
;W[fo]C[White now protects one of his weak points while expanding his framework.]
(;B[jj]C[If I have to pinpoint the losing moves, it would be black's three moves in the middle of the board.

This move does not protect a black weakness. It does not expand a black framework. It does not take territory.
Neither does it attack or reduce white (white will not expand this far from either of his frameworks). It is almost a wasted move, and that at a crucial time.]
;W[no]C[This removes almost all possibilities from the bottom.]
;B[jh]C[The same holds for this move.

One possible strategy black might be thinking of is of using the two stones either to make a framework on the left or on the right, stretching all the way to the tenth line. However, both would be open to white invasions]
(;W[ne]
(;B[og]C[This is a good move. It protects the black group while trying to get the two stones in the middle involved in an active strategy. However, white can still reduce the framework.]

C[And here the same thing. This illustrates the problem with the strategy behind the three stones in the middle]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[lh];W[ng];B[nh];W[of];B[pg]C[With these reducing moves, white is making more territory than black. There is a proverb stating there are no points in the centre. This is a nice example: the black framework in the centre, eventhough it looks imposing, is actually not taking many points.]
;W[fk]
(;B[gg]C[This move seems to prepare for an invasion at the top, but white can protect in a nice way:]
(;W[fi];B[eh];W[dn];B[cn]C[Instead of invading, white just calmly reduces. Since white has a nice lead, this is the proper strategy for white. Black needs to play aggressively, looking for complications.]
;W[dm];B[jn];W[lo];B[lm];W[on];B[pm]C[Black follows white's lead. This means white reduces the black territory and expands their own with every move, and black submits to this.]

(;B[ho]C[This is better, black taking initiative, but a reduction like this is not enough.]
(;W[hp]C[I would advise against an attachment here myself.]
(;B[io]C[With this move black requests white to remove their last weakness. This move, which does not take any territory and does not attack, is only helping white. It is a fine example of a "thank you"-move.]

Yes, for example by playing S2. White only threatens to take a few points away in the middle, nothing compared to the value of an end-game move in the bottom right corner.]

Main remarks:

* Keep an eye out for weaknesses in the positions of both players. If there is a way to protect your own weakness while doing something else (expanding, extending, attacking, reducing) this is always a good idea. Do not force your opponent to remove his own weaknesses.
* When you think you are behind in territory, and playing reductions is not sufficient, look for trouble. If you're going to lose, it's better to go out with a bang. Start enough complications and who knows what will happen ?
* Some endgame moves are deceptively large. Some of them get played long before you'd expect them to, just due to their size. Often such moves also settle your groups. In this game, the end-game move in the bottom right would have been enough to win the game.

In any case, the strategy with the stones in the middle, even though I did not think it a good strategy here, does show a crucial skill in go: improvisation. If you look at the board at the end of the game, it is actually clear that white did not reduce the right-hand side enough, so in this case it actually worked.

Some recommended reading, if you feel like it:
* Attack and defence
* Get strong at the endgame

I hope you find this review helpful.
Keep playing !
