C[Hi Enrico.

My comments are marked with (magic:). I will try to answer your questions along the way, and I will put a summary at the end.]
;B[dd]C[Game played: 4/5/2002 at 14:23
A game which seemed to get needlessly complicated. I misread an attack on a weak group escaping into the centre and consequently lost the game.]
;W[pd];B[dp];W[qq];B[dj];W[fc];B[df];W[db];B[jq]CR[cc]C[I don't know enough about fuseki yet to know whether it would have been better to have played at c17...

(magic:)
If you'd played C17 (red spot) then he would still have had to add another stone to his group to stabilise it (J16/J17) and you could have played down here aftwerwards. Not answering this move means that you will probably loose the territory in the corner. Personally, I don't like D18 - it tries to settle the corner too early - at this stage of the game, I prefer to play J16/17]
;W[pk];B[kc]C[Seemed like a good time to invade

(magic:)
Well chosen spot - you can extend either side.];W[cb]C[is this just a bad move on MFGO's part?

(magic:)
Not necessarily bad on its own, but out of sequence. This move does more or less guarantee him a life on the upper side (You often see C17 instead) , but it doesn't do anything to pressure your invading stones. He should first pressure your stones and then, if he has to, make life on the inside. J16 or even 17 would probably make more sense.]
;B[hc]C[(magic:)
Good.];W[pn]C[(magic:)
A rather pointless tenuki from MFOG. He has one weak group in the upper left and a potential target in the shape of your invasion to play around with which should be more urgent.]
;B[nc]CR[nq]C[thought about playing around o3 instead but though this would give my upper group more lebensraum

(magic:)
Agree. It is also, in most cases, sente, so you can play in the lower right later.]
;W[pf];B[pb]C[(magic:)  Again, I don't think I'd do this right now. Your group has a solid base, you don't need this at the moment.]
;W[qc];B[ge]C[wanted to seal W in

(magic:)
Maybe overly ambitious. White can live on the spot, sealing him in is no goal in itself. The lower side is where the attention should go to.   Locally, I think I prefer to exchange G18 for F18 before trying to squeeze white.]
;W[lq];B[jp]CR[jo]C[is this move ok?? g4 better?

(magic:)
K5 (marked) is good. G4 is submissive and still leaves you weak. K5 protects the lower left (invading is more difficult) and is also uselful to push into the right side later. You could also play e.g. L5 which is a more direct counter-attack.
The played move is not bad, but better moves are around.];W[gp]
;B[gn]CR[dn][en]C[seemed like I needed to cap

(magic:)  Depends what you want to do. Problem with a cap is that they often give you weak structures around. White can happily get out, and you will be cut up. It is better if you can pressure white more indirectly, making her struggle to live or connect out. D6 or E6 help your left and put pressure on the invading stone. (You will notice that D6 or E6 would have worked well with K4 at K5).

If you feel uncomfortable pushing him towards your weak stones, e.g. J6 is better. As it is, G6 is not connected to anything and may become a headache later.]
;W[ho];B[in]C[(magic:)
This is leaving lots of holes in your 'cap'.
Variation shows one way to chop this up and live on the spot at the same time.]

(;W[fo];B[en]C[(magic:)
Previous var still works];W[hq];B[fq]C[wanted to destroy eyespace

(magic:)
Yes. It seems that MFOG is more set on trying to live locally (although failing to do so) than to cut out and escape. Previous variation still works.]
;W[cl]C[invasions always seem to make my heart quicken!...still, must remain calm...

(magic:)
This is slightly overambitious. White may be able to live on the spot, but unless she can connect with one of the outside groups, it serves little purpose.]
;B[el]CR[cn]C[preferred capping to eating away at the c stone base

(magic:)
Same comment regarding capping as earlier.  If you just answer at C6 (marked), you cash in some points and let white have the hassle of living. White can still easily push thorugh your stones on the 6th line, which would put your entire corner in danger.
You said that you found that this game tourned out more complicated than you wanted - this is one of the reasons. If you answer with simple, solid moves when invaded, it will be your opponent who gets the trouble.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[bp];B[cq];W[kn];B[jl]C[looked like I had to defend my potential territory on the left

(magic:)
Hmm. If white cuts between K4 and J6, the whole bottom could become white. There is little territory in the center. If anything, whites last move is weakly connected to his other stones and could be attacked. His lower right corner should be cut down to size while you still can.
If you want to defend territory, you are 'open at the bottom' on the left side both at the top and at the bottom...]
;W[kp];B[jo]C[necessary?

(magic:)
Absolutely.];W[ko];B[bj]C[(magic:)

Good move.];W[bk];B[ck]C[(magic:)
This move is too small.];W[bq];B[cr]C[too cautious?---b2 instead?

(magic:)
B2 makes a very weak corner which can be exploited in all sorts of ways. This is fine if you're unsure.]
;W[br];B[nf]CR[mf]C[trying to build up the right-hand wall of a large central moyo

(magic:)
Good idea, but...
Too far from your own / too close to white. N14 is much better connected to your own stones and makes better shape.]
;W[dk];B[cj];W[dl];B[ek];W[hl]CR[ll][ee]C[this looks like it's aimed right at the heart of things...and seemingly is the move that provokes a response from me that begins the win for W

(magic:)  White would have been better off extending his own moyo in the lower right by playing e.g. M8 or, if she wants to reduce yours, play somewhere closer to her own groups. e.g. E15 is interesting. Here, she will have a long run to get 'home']
;B[hn]C[(magic:)
Good response.];W[hj];B[jj]C[(magic:)
Still good response];W[hh];B[jh]C[the chase continues...

(magic:)  Indeed. White is not doing much, but you are gaining a series of stones facing the right side, which could be useful later.]
;W[ig];B[hf]CR[jg][kf][eh][ph]C[there was almost certainly a better move here

(magic:)
If your plan is to kill white, this is not bad - as it steals euespace. But since white can still wriggle, killing my not be the best choice. You could either push with K13 (messy), stop from a distance with L14 or cash in some points with E12. Your string of stones on the K-line enable you to come back and play moves like Q12 later, since he must play at least a couple of more moves to get his center stones to safety.
Anytime you feel like it, you can cut at H9, although the benefit is small.]
;W[jf];B[jg]C[(magic:)
This white formation is uncuttable. Indeed, it is so strong that is often considered to be bad shape, since it is unflexible and because 3 stones have been used for what 2 stones could have done almost as well.]
;W[if];B[hg];W[ih];B[gh];W[kf];B[ii]C[don't know how best to deal with this rampaging but weak W group

(magic:)
Now that he has bent around the top of your stones on the K-line, their usefulness is a lot lower. With the contactplays on the left, you have not left behind a strong wall either. Now, all of a sudden, it becomes important to kill him, because otherwise your position will be weak. This is ironic, since he was the weak one to begin with.

You should never try to kill unless you are absolutely certain that you can. Chase and push, but make sure that you cash in as well. When attacking, always ask yourself if the moves you play are efficient if he lives. If they are only good attacking moves but serve no other purpose, they are probably not the best moves around.

Like you say, it is now difficult to deal with him.];W[hi];B[lg]
C[(magic:)
Good.];W[le];B[kd]CR[ne][oe]C[all the time I'm trying to attack the weak W group with moves that provide me with profit but I don't seem to know the moves...I played L16 in order to prevent any eyemaking moves from W but perhaps should have played somewhere near o or p15?

(magic:)
I agree that one of the marked places would have been a better move than the one played. But you are quite thin at the top and he could ruin your position if left unstopped. Locally, K16 is better shape and also works as an eye-remover. I would have probably played O15 myself, although it is very passive.]
;W[ne];B[oe]CR[ne][pf][pd]C[(magic:)
Wrong side. This shape (marked) is very strong and difficult to cut, even with the help of your stones around. You could just cut at N15, though.
In the upcoming sequence you loose out badly.];W[id];B[ic];W[md]
;B[nd];W[mg];B[mf];W[me];B[lf];W[ke];B[og];W[od];B[mc]C[perhaps my most unwise move so far...]
;W[of]CR[nh]C[...and W has escaped  :-(

(magic:)
Much more importantly, you have weak positions all around.
Now that you realised that you have lost the battle for this group, forget all about it. Take a deep breath and sit back and look at the goban with fresh eyes to find the important area to play in.

The top left is open at the bottom and represents many points for either side.
The right side is open and black could reduce the white territory here.
The right bottom has a large white influence which black should think about reducing.
The black groups in the middle right are weak and disconnected and need reinforcement.

My choice would probably be O12 (marked) which protects against the cut at O13, threatens R12/R11 and can also serve as a basis to play incursions into the lower right later (maybe starting with e.g. P8)]
;B[oh]C[(magic:)
This does (rather bluntly) threaten an invasion on the right, but does not protect against the cut and does not provide as solid a base to thrust downwards from either.]
;W[qh];B[ec]C[(magic:)
This is small. He will answer and you haven't gained a lot.]
;W[eb];B[gb]C[(magic:)
Ditto];W[li]C[(magic:)
He judges the escape of his marked stone and attack of your centre groups as more important than the top.  I would agree. He also indirectly prevents you from reducing his lower right corner.  Note that his top left corner group can live as it is, even if you cut.]
;B[nj]C[(magic:)
Good idea];W[nl]C[(magic:)
This is reasonable, and it shows that his last move was too deep.]
;B[lk];W[im];B[jm];W[jn]CR[bd]C[(magic:)
Your group has lost its base but can live on the spot.   There are not really any big battles left to fight now. The middle will live with hardly any points and there will be some smaller reductions along the boundary and the final yose.  Concerning the center, I don't think that white can kill, so black should take sente and play elsewhere.
White can reduce the top left a lot, so black might want to invest a defensive move there. B16 is probably sente against the upper left white group, so white should respond.  Black could try to invade the lower right - it'd be difficult, but he could benefit by trying.]
;B[hm];W[cd];B[ce];W[ba]C[(magic:)
If this were a human, I'd say it was a mis-click. Since it is MFOG it probably makes some eyes or something. In this context, it's a useless move, though.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[bd];W[mh];B[lh];W[il];B[ik];W[hk];B[ij];W[ki]
;B[ji];W[ng]C[just silly];B[mi];W[io];B[co]C[(magic:)
This is reasonable, but...];W[jr]C[(magic:)
This is much bigger and also effectively kills off any profit black could gain from an attempted invasion.]
;B[ir];W[kr];B[iq];W[hr]C[(magic:)
Tricky, this. If you cut at J1 white will win the semeai. If you don't cut you loose as well.]
;B[fp];W[go];B[gq];W[fn];B[fm];W[gm];B[gl];W[bo];B[gr];W[dm]
;B[fi]C[wanted to protect the cut at e10];W[qb];B[pc];W[em]
;B[hs];W[fd];B[mm]C[wanted to eat into the bottom right];W[kh]
;B[kg];W[fl];B[fk];W[mo]C[(magic:)
I think that white is being too lenient here. A push and cut at N8/M7 would have put more pressure on black.
If defending, O5 is better, this move is too close to the white wall on the left.]
;B[nn];W[ml];B[lm]C[(magic:)
Good response];W[km]C[(magic:)
M8 puts more pressure on black.];B[ll];W[kl];B[kk]C[ thought this was preferable to k9

This Ko isn't really worth much.];B[dc]C[now threatening f18?

(magic:)
Yes. Even if white lives, F18 is worth a good 10+ points.];W[fb]
;B[fe];W[bl];B[ac];W[ab]C[(magic:)
White has a ko to live, worth around 30 points. There are few issues on the goban which are bigger than this.]
;B[bb];W[hd];B[gd];W[bc];B[or]C[(magic:)
This is not really a threat - if black plays R2 then the ko at P2 becomes worth something, but it is still less than  the upper left corner.
If white has many good ko-threats left, he should answer. Otherwise, he should make life and accept the loss.]

Overall comments:

You played a game which was quite good. There were no real monster mistakes.
I think that what you will learn the most from is:
1. React more purposefully to invasions. The reasons you get invaded is because your opponent thinks that you have made a too large a structure. This is good. The fact that he has to take the risk and invade your structure means that you should benefit while chasing him. This does not mean that you should try to defend your entire structure nor that you should kill him. Chase him and let him live, but make him pay for it. Having a weak group throughout a game is more trouble than losing a 10 stone group after a brief battle. Sometimes you should (and many players try to) plan your moyo so that you know where the invasion is likely to come and you know what to do with it.
2. Think about the direction of play. This ties in with the above. Your moves typically push the opponent towards or away from something or force him to flee or live locally. How he reacts depend on your moves. Planning your moves make him react the way you want. Very satisfying :-)
3. Do not get caught up in a battle and loose the view of the entire goban. Keep the global vision and play moves which work locally and globally (or the other way around).
4. Have fun playing :-)

I hope that this review was of use to you. Please don't hesitate to ask me questions, if you have any.

Best wishes,
