C[Hello I am rhianna playing white, and this was a game played on KGS
Thanks in advance for commentating

I feel like a weakness is not judging to well when a group is in danger, and am always reluctant to go into a fight.

Any general comments and observations would be welcome.

thanks

Rhianna.
_______________________________________
Thanks for taking the time to send in a game for reviewing and adding comments. Your comments  are very helpful for reviewers.
First of all, I've had a look at your game, and I'll be going through a few (maybe 3) major points and concepts I think will be helpful for you to review.
1. Eye-space.
This is the space required to make at least 2 eyes. In other words, enough space to live.
I found that you played moves that had limited potential eye space, hence your stones became weak and hard to defend. I'll point out some examples in the game.

2. "3rd line for territory, 4th line for influence"
This is just a guideline, not exactly a rule. We play on the 3rd line (that's columns C, R, and rows 17, 3.) for ease of making a 'base' (easy to make 2 eyes) and 4th line (4th line from the edge) for influence. It is easier to attack from 4th line.

3. Knowing your options.
You play a move, and you should know what the stone does, and where it can play next. Can it make a base? Can it extend along the side? Can it run away easily? It needs a plan to live. Otherwise, it is too easy to die.

Without further ado, let's begin the review.

rhianna [14k\]: greetings];B[pp];W[dd]C[bleep69 [14k\]: hi gg]
;B[qd];W[do];B[nc];W[dq];B[jp]
(;W[lp]C[Let's talk about M4.
Why did you play here? (Multiple choice time.)
A: Territory
B: To attack Black (B)
C: To prevent B from taking an important point ('big point')
D: To play on the right side to be more spread out.

If A: This is a poor move to gain territory. It is not on the 3rd line and the 3rd line is the perfect distance  to use the edge to help you make a base. 
If B: M4 is weaker than the K4-Q4 duo. One vs. Two is generally a bad thing for you. M4 does not have the backup from D3-D5, it's too far away.
See First variation for [A\] and [B\].

[If C\]: M4 is not a crucial point for black. K4-Q4 is strong enough at this stage in the game. If anything, Black will want to go play at Q10 to join the top group and bottom group together in a massive framework. 
Therefore, if W wanted to prevent this from happening, W will play Q10, or R10. Refer to Move 7.

[If D\]: At long last, D. I hope you have read [A\], [B\], and [C\] too, because they are still helpful.
M4 is very weak. It cannot provide you with the necessary strength to be able to live on the right side where B is. If White wants to play on the right side, I suggest Q10 or R10, it is the easiest and safest option]
(;B[mq]C[B takes W's base.];W[lq];B[jq];W[hp]C[rhianna: not sure what to do about my m3 group, i decide to play close but not commit more stones. I have a poor sence of whether they are defenble after blacks next]
;B[ln]C[bleep69 [14k\]: cool, thanks

After this move, I wouldn't bother saving the M3 group. No base, no eyespace, and now no direction to go. It is caged in. I would play somewhere else to make some points.]

(;W[og]C[P13. We call these kinds of moves 'floating' because they have nothing to anchor them and they have no base. No 2 eyes, and not attached to any safety.]
;B[cf];W[dh];B[ef]
(;W[df]C[bleep69 [14k\]: hah, what do ido now???>

W doesn't need to separate C14 and E14, and can't. What W needs to do is protect W, and at the same time, prevent B from making 2 eyes.

Even then, if B manages to make 2 eyes, W will have solidifed W's territory and gained overall.]

;B[ej];W[bj]TR[kc][he][mg][qg][mj]C[bleep69 [14k\]: especially considering that was where i was going to go...

P13 isn't a good move for B either. Triangles are other moves good for B. Some of them are good for White too.]
;B[bi];W[el]C[rhianna: black's left side and lower left side look huge, but i always feel like defending my space is more urgent

Defending your groups is more important than attacking your opponent's groups. Unless you can do both at the same time. (or if you are a defensive sort of player.)
But, you should also make sure you play moves that make groups with few weaknesses, otherwise you always defend and never attack.]

This move allows W to deter B from playing R10 or Q10. It is good for W because:
1. takes B's crucial point. If B takes this, B will have a very strong framework, and all B's stones will be working together. 
2. W has options to make a base  at A or B, and they are equally as good. I like option B better because it allows White to attack Q4 later on. Attacking R16 is harder because O17 is closeby. 
3. After making a base with either option A or B, White still has the additional option of moving towards the centre.]
