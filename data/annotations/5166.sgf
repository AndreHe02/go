C[Im playing white. Generally I think I played this game pretty well. Except once I got myself a weak group which black could have killed but didn't. Still I couldnt surpass black in score. I'd like to know which kind of situations I'm playing wrong. Am I too slow sometimes or do I leave too many weaknesses behind?

Thanks

F. I think your made one big strategical mistake by getting yourself two weak groups on the upper side. Later on you catched up nicely by attacking a weak black group. Otherwise I think you played a good game, so just take care in the future when (not) to start battles in the sphere influence of you opponent.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[ep];B[ce];W[qj];B[jd];W[ej]C[F: Maybe better on C10 or D10 to counter the influence of the black shimari]

;B[qn];W[pn];B[qm];W[qf]C[F: I think it would be more consistent to expand your moyo by a move like P8]
;B[nd];W[ok]C[F: You got away with it, since black responded on the upper side. Locally P8 is better shape. This move leaves much aji (see variations at next move)]

;B[bo];W[cl];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
(;W[gd]C[F: You've done quite well on the lower side. You've got a huge moyo, but you should consider that you have a weak point a F3 (giving black a free move there, if he wants to invade) and that there's still place enough to make an invasion. So instead of G16, you could consider other moves like the variations.
But G16 is also playable.];B[ch];W[jc];B[kc];W[ic];B[kb]
(;W[jq]C[F: This is not good. Too slow and not ambitious enough. This should be at least J4.
And more important, your stones on the upper side, in blacks moyo, are still unsettled. You should take care of them first. See variation]
;B[jj]
(;W[kd]C[F. You could call this the losing move. You're creating another white group there where black is strong. You will have to look after two weak white groups. Simply running away with your G16 stones is much better.]
;B[je];W[ld];B[mc];W[lf];B[jg]C[F: Ideal for black. Splitting white into two and connecting with his K10 stone.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[kf];B[he];W[jf];B[if];W[ig]C[F: Another risky cut]

;W[gi];B[gj];W[fj];B[hj];W[id];B[ie];W[fb]C[would e18 be better for making eyes?
F: I don't think so. You're so weak here that you shouldn't be able to live her at all.]
;B[fc];W[gb];B[hd];W[hc];B[ec];W[jb];B[eb];W[ja]C[black could kill here.
F: Yes,  the game would be over then, which proves that your L 16 was a bad move.]
;B[mb];W[ha];B[gc];W[ei]C[F. But this is sill a very good result for black.  He is strong in the center now and should be able to greatly reduce your moyo on the lower side. Further more there is still a chance to attack your M14 group.]

(;B[gm]C[F: Now that black is strong in the center he could invade much deeper. See variation]
;W[df];B[fe];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[cg]C[F: Nice gain, but the lower side is more important now.]

C[am i trying to kill correctly?
F: You're chasing black correctly. Maybe you can kill him, byt if not you will be able to profit in other ways.]
