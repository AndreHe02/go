C[ADAP [5k?\]: good luck and have fun

--------

rosecroix: Hi. My name is Manuel Ramírez and I'm from Chile, South America. I played white in this game. I think that my fuseki is what i need to improve. Specially, i usually find myself playing as a reaction of what my opponent does...and I've been told that one has to play his own game. Is this right?

Thanks for your comments.

catch22: Hi Manuel, hello from the Netherlands. I'll be reviewing your game. Although the fuseki is also the weakest part of my game, I will try my best to help.

Always reacting to the moves of your opponent, and following him around the board is indeed not good. You should always be looking for ways to take the initiative. However, not all costs. If you incur a loss by ignoring a move locally, you have to make sure that it is offset by the gain you got elsewhere on the board.]
;B[qc]C[rosecroix [6k?\]: yes, have a good game];W[dd];B[qq]
;W[dq];B[co];W[ep]C[rosecroix: Is the joseki suitable for the situation?

catch22: Yes, I don't think there is anything wrong with it.]
;B[cl]
(;W[op]C[catch22: I don't think that this is a good move. 

Firstly, the joseki in the bottom left is not yet finished (see the variation). Although it is good to try to take sente, that should not be done at all cost. 

Secondly, there is no real urgency to approach a 3-3 stone. Letting Black add another stone nearby is not something to worry about. White will still have plenty opportunities to play at that part of the board. Black already has some territory in the corner, and he won't be able to claim (much of) the side by adding one more stone.

Thirdly, if you want to approach this stone, then this does not seem to be the right place. It seems better to play at O4 instead.]
;B[po]TR[op]C[catch22: The exchange of the marked stones is clearly in Black's favour. 

The white stone does not have much purpose. It does not really help White to territory at the bottom, as Black can easily slide underneath. 

White cannot effectively build influence either. If White plays a move like P5, he is pushing from behind and helping Black to fourth line territory. Doing something like this is only justified when, considering the whole board, the influence is worth it. This is not the case here.]
;W[kq]TR[op]C[rosecroix: Was L3 premature?

catch22: I think the previous move (at P4) was the one that was premature. 

However, I also think that this move is at the wrong position. It is too far from White's stones at the bottom left. Yet, it does not have a good relation with the marked white stone either. Black still has a good invasion point at N3.

So judging this position, White has already fallen behind. Black's stones are all placed quite effectively, whereas White's stones aren't.

One way to approach the opening is to make sure that all your moves are efficient. Especially when you are White this can help. In the beginning, Black will have the better position on the board. This is unlikely to change soon, and may last until the end of the game. This is not a problem. When the difference on the board is not more than the komi, White still wins. So, White can afford to be a little bit patient. Playing more efficiently than your opponent is all that's required.]
;B[fc]C[rosecroix: I didn't quite like my fuseki situation here...black looks pretty solid and wide

catch22: Black's stones indeed seem to be better placed. However, the opening is not over yet. There are too few stones on the board for anything to be solid.]
;W[cf];B[jd];W[pd];B[pc];W[od];B[qd]
(;W[pg]C[rosecroix: Overplay?

catch22: This is how White usually responds if Black's previous move had been at S15. However, because Black played at R16 instead, playing at Q14 now is better (see variation).

White should also check if playing at R15 is possible, but that does not seem to work (see other variation).]
;B[qf]
(;W[qg]C[catch22: White could play at Q14 to keep his stones connected (see variation).]
;B[pf];W[of];B[og]C[catch22: This cut is severe.];W[nf];B[oh]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[oj];W[pk];B[ok];W[rf]C[catch22: I think this forcing move is good...]
;B[re]
(;W[rg]TR[rf][re]C[catch22: ... however, I am not sure that White should connect here. It lets Black close White in, and connect his own five stones in the middle to those in the bottom right. 

The exchange of the marked stones is already in White's favour as is. White can afford to play elsewhere and sacrifice his marked stone. Although Black can capture, this will be gote.

So before settling his group at the right, White has to first try to break out into the center, or at the very least, separate the black stones. See variation.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[qm];W[pm];B[ol];W[rl];B[rm];W[rj];B[om]
(;W[lc]C[catch22: This is not good shape. It leaves too much bad aji behind for Black to maybe exploit later. For instance, later Black may be able to separate this white stone from the other ones. 

Also, it is too early for White to think about attacking the two black stones at the top. Although White can maybe invade at H17, Black does not mind, as he can still jump into the corner at C17 in response. Since Black has also built a nice center facing wall, White should secure his group before thinking about an attack.

Playing at N16 therefore seems much better (see variation).]
;B[nc]
(;W[ld]C[catch22: It seems better to play at N16. See variation.]
;B[oc]C[catch22: This is not a good move by Black. It only encourages White to strenghten his stones.]
;W[nd];B[db]
(;W[ci]C[catch22: I think it is maybe better for White to play at C17 to keep Black out of the corner (see variation). Letting Black take C17 secures the black stones (while also being worth a lot of points). It also makes an invasion at H17 far less effective. 

Admittedly, C11 is a nice point. Black would like to play here as well. Still, Black does not yet have to worry about his two stones at the left. He can still secure them by playing B3, or run away with E8.]

;B[kr];W[jq];B[oq];W[pp];B[qp];W[pq];B[pr]C[rosecroix: Are this moves ok, or should I leave the aji for later?

How important is to play K2 now?

catch22: Usually, moves like White's last one should be avoided. It reduces White's liberties by one (which could become critical later on) for a gain of only one point.

However, in this case it creates important aji. As a result, K2 becomes actually pretty much sente. See the variation that follows in a couple of moves.]
;W[qo]TR[pm]C[catch22: I think this is a good move. White threatens to pull out the marked stone...]
;B[pn]TR[qo]C[catch22: Black defends, but the marked stone creates useful aji.]

(;W[dm]C[catch22: I think K2 is pretty much sente for White now. See variation.

rosecroix: I wanted to put pressure on these black stones...was this move ok?

catch22: I think I would attack the group with B7 instead (see variation).]

(;B[dl]C[catch22: I think Black can afford to simply link up with C7 (see variation).]
;W[em];B[dj];W[di];B[ej];W[cm]C[catch22: This is a big move. It takes profit, while completely taking away Black's base. Black now has no option but to run away, and his stones have become heavy. Black should not have allowed this.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[bo];B[ei];W[ef]C[catch22: I think that it is better shape to play at D13 instead.]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[ge];W[eh];B[fh];W[fg]C[catch22: It is better to play at E13 instead. The variation in the game is obviously not good for White.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[ch]C[catch22: Oops, this turns the table completely. Instead of a weak black group, there is now a weak white group. :-(]
;W[bi];B[bh];W[cg];B[ah];W[gh];B[fi];W[hg];B[jf]C[catch22: White's position is now very difficult. Black can start an ideal splitting attack.]
;W[jl];B[gf];W[gg];B[hi]
(;W[jg]C[catch22: This weakens the white group at the top right. It's therefore better to save this group in a different way. See variation.]
;B[kg];W[jh];B[kf];W[jb];B[ib];W[jc];B[ic];W[id]C[catch22: This does not seem to gain anything. So better not play it.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[gc];W[ia]C[catch22: Although it's sente, this move is better left unplayed. It does not really achieve anything.]
;B[hc]
(;W[gk]C[catch22: With two weak groups, White cannot afford to play moves like this. The group in the top right is in grave danger and needs to be secured right now, e.g. starting with N18 to create eye space. See variation.

Also locally the move at G9 is highy questionable. Firstly, it prevents White from pushing through at G11 and cutting, which may be necessary to safe the top left group. Secondly, Black can still play at F8, so it does not really give White much territory either.]
;B[gj];W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj]C[catch22: This cut does not gain Black anything.]
