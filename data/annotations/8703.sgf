;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[pj];W[oq]C[was this a good move?

gpaul: This is an excellent move. Black is playing very defensively and you're punishing him for it by pressing in close.]
(;B[op];W[np];B[oo]
(;W[jp]TR[np][oq]SQ[oo][op]C[I can't quite recall the joseki but this feels wrong. firstly, the triangles are much weaker than the two squares. And the move at K4 is very high (4th line without support is *very* easy to invade. Any black play at .. well let me show you]
(;B[dj]
(;W[ci]SQ[di][ei][cj][ej][ck][dk][ek]C[This is too close. This is called a contact move (all the squares) and is used to stableize both yourself and your oponent. Even though it looks aggressive, it really isn't. The reason is that by playing either D11 or C10, black makes an iron pillar (two stones horizontally/vertically touching like P4+P5) while removing one of C11's liberties.

Only make contact moves if you feel unstable or you're ready to engage for the kill. A play at D12 would have been better, but even that will be invaded at C14...see the other branch for some examples of decent approach play here]
;B[fc];W[de]C[perfect. For black to keep attacking in the upper left will be very inefficient, far bigger moves remain (R15 is huge for black, so it is huge for white).]
;B[jc]C[Too weak, too low. Inefficient.];W[qe]C[i planned to reduce his moyo

This is the single biggest move in the game thus far. Well read. This is huge. If black played here you would likely lose the game or be fighting for air until the end.]
;B[pe]C[he likes his attachment joseki. Every joseki has a theme: the attachment joseki relinquishes the outside to the opponent while securing edge territory for yourself. In this case black already has K17, I would play the pincer at R13 because Q17 is very strong where it is, meaning white has limited room to pressure it.]
;W[qf]C[Why not follow the standard joseki here? Q14];B[qh]
C[I would jump to R17 and be happy to live having reduced much moyo.]
(;W[rg]C[Not bad, but you have no base to make eyes with yet. A play in the other direction gets you in a much better spot...see the previous branch]
;B[dn]C[Weak approach by black];W[sj]C[Monkey jump is a great move, but it is for the midgame. There is much still to be done before you start thinking about reducing his territory. An outright invasion at R6 would be preferrable if you feel like you could escape at P7 or live, using the threat of connection at S12.]
;B[rl];W[rh]C[Just in time];B[rj];W[ri]C[nice];B[sk];W[rc]SQ[qh]
[pj][rj][sk][pl][rl]C[very nice, staying cool. With this much of a wall you can start to take apart his very loose structure at the squares]
;B[qd];W[rd]
(;B[mc]C[This is too low, He is sooo very strong here already.]
(;W[qb]C[This is another good endgame move that is played too early. Think: where can you play that threatens him most, while gaining influence and/or territory for yourself. This move strengthens an already strong white group, attempts to threaten a very strong black group (and can be ignored if black decides to do so)

A play at R3 or O3 would threaten him more. A play at C5 (even though its a contact move) sets D6 running (see the alternative branch) and a play at B9 solidifies your framework and undermines black's "open skirt" on the left. See branch.]
;B[pf]C[useless move, white can see black is aiming for big center territory. At this point none of white's stones are threatened, time to make one or two big jumps to the center to eiliminate black's chances:]
(;W[qj]C[good];B[si]
(;W[sh]C[A bit premature, if black playes at T12, what have you lost?, rather take the opportunity and stretch as per the other branch...]
;B[qk];W[qi];B[pg];W[ph];B[pi];W[qg];B[oh]C[i live there but i think i failed as he has an amazing wall

Yes, You fought very hard to hold onto the edge, where you were already alive :)]
;W[co]C[good time to tenuki, and a solid one at that. This *does* give black the choice as to how he wants to survive, whereas B9 would force him into action to protect his base. Although I guess this does the same ^^]
;B[fp];W[gq]C[This is letting him off too easy. You are very strong and he has no base and can be easily cut at E5. Attach him hard at F3!]
;B[fq];W[gr]C[Win the edge but lose the corner - that is not efficient.]
;B[lp]C[This is the danger of playing K4 instead of K3 - it is very high. Not bad though but you must expect to be invaded. A 4th line play is completely focussed on center influence and only once it is backed up by knight's moves or large knight's moves to the 3rd line does it become territorial]
;W[lq]C[This attachment is greedy, give you opponent what he is due (imagine that you will hold onto about 50% of your moyo, and never let your opponent hold onto more than 50% of his!)]
;B[kq];W[mq]C[very good, you strengthen your weaker stones with good shape. A followup play at Q3 or even R2/R3 will make good territory. But your lower left corner needs attention first. Threatening to connect at E2 is good, but let's see what happens next first]
;B[kp]
(;W[ho]C[try and connect first, before you start running.];B[jq]
C[bottom edge is forfeit now.];W[eo]C[That is called "playing at the elephant's eye" and is a very good move if you're splitting two weak groups (which you are).

You also threaten to connect your two weak groups, which should really be your priority right now. If you have two weak groups close to each other, the opponent can attack both with a single stone, meaning at least one of them cannot block and gets even weaker. Hence the koan "Never have more than one weak group."]

;B[fn]C[all these were really good calls by you. If black had worried less about escaping and more about invading things would have looked a lot different :(]
;W[gm];B[kn]C[This needs to be countered at N5 before black gets to play there.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[hf];B[jf];W[ih]C[This would have been better played at J16, This move isn't pressuring black, and it is obvious you're trying to connect. Because black isn't forced to respond to save a group, he can focus all his efforts on preventing your connect]
;B[jj];W[gj];B[cn];W[bk]C[nice];B[am]C[wtf?];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo]
C[good];B[ck];W[cj];B[cl];W[fo]C[the two-stone skip from G7 to G10 can be cut very easily! Then it becomes a race between black left trying to live and white center trying to live]
;B[do];W[ep];B[en];W[fk]C[go deeper, you have much support and will mess up his potential eye shape. just don't get cut off!]
;B[el];W[in]TR[jo][jp]SQ[fb][hd][id][ie][kh][qq]C[This saves 2 useless stones that have no territory impact. A play at squares is much bigger.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[jl]C[now you're paying him to build a wall that encloses massive territory. Don't play moves that force your opponent to play moves that are good for him.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[il]C[you gained 2 points with J9, but lost sente...]
;B[fi];W[di];B[ej];W[ek];B[dk];W[fm];B[fl];W[fj];B[ei]
(;W[bl]C[D7 kills him unless he can connect to another group, which seems easy to prevent.]
;B[dh];W[ch];B[dg];W[fg]C[You play his eye point and connect, very good, but don't think he is dead until you play D7]
;B[he];W[ge];B[nr];W[kh]C[a good tactical choice - this is bigger than responding at the bottom. But don't let the bottom die]

(;W[mo]C[nice, but due to the turn of events down at the right, you will want to play L2 soon to force him to block at K2 so you can live down here. See the alternate branch]

This move undermines black's whole strategy: build a large high (4th line) framework on the right-hand side. If he blocks with the shoulder hit at R16 you force him to take very little territory in the upper right while you jump lightly to R11, threatening to cut into his remaining framework and solidifying yourself on the edge.

BTW, playing Q17 as an opening move makes sense ONLY if black intends to follow it up immediately (3rd black stone in the game) with R15 - otherwise this happens, and Q17 is now very very inefficient, especially considdering it was an opening move.]
