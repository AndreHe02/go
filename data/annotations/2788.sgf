C[this game was played on KGS between Myself (10k) and Ernst (9k). i basicly though that i played the opening well with one or two exceptions.  the middle game i also thought i fought well in the middle game i thought, attacking a weak group when my thickness was almost enough to kill it. but the yose was terrible.

anyways i would like comments on all parts of the game, since my weakest area is the one i already think i'm good at :). but with picticular attention to the endgame.]
;B[qd];W[cq];B[pq];W[dc];B[po];W[jp];B[ce];W[ed]C[this move i haven't delt with before and am not sure of the joeski. another thought on how i was considering playing is in the variation.]

(;B[cc]TR[dg][ch][ci][cj]C[pem: Strange move. A common move would be one of the marked points.]
;W[cb];B[bc];W[oc];B[lc]C[my thought here was to force w to run or secure a small spot in the corner while claiming some of the top for myself

pem: But W can run with P14 which then branches in a multitude of variations.]

(;W[pd]LB[kc:A][ld:B]C[pem: I have only seen this with the pincers A and B. I'm not sure how much the position of the pincer matters for the joseki. Black should play R15.]

(;B[pe]C[pem: I don't like this; letting W play R17 makes it too easy for him.]
;W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[qf];W[oe];B[ic]C[hey, one of my plans worked out like i thought it would. that's a first :)

pem: I don't think this is good for B.];W[qm];B[qn]C[pem: Bad shape. I only strengthens W and leaves a weak spot at R4. Better to play  R15 or a pincer at R10.]
;W[pm];B[qi];W[gc];B[ch]C[i think this is too small. any suggestions?

pem: It's a bit slow, but probably wise. B has played a strange shape in the corner which makes a W move around this spot painful.]
;W[cn];B[lp];W[kq]C[pem: Also questionable. Better at M3.];B[lq]
;W[jn];B[eq]C[this is probably way to deep. e6 is probably correct, but i thought if he capped i'd have some room to live small inside.

pem: I think this is too close to W's strong 3-3 stone. The moyo is probably invadable, but it's hard to advice a specific path; it depends on the player's own fighting skills. But there is a weak spot at J3 to aim for.]

C[i had hopes of isolating the q7 group of w and attacking them with this move. but he can connect easily

pem: B must play Q12.];W[qg];B[rg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pg];B[ln]C[here i was thinking of p10 as well.]
;W[oj]
(;B[rf]C[pem: B must play P11!];W[oi];B[le]C[this was to counter the w wall that has developed]

;W[hb];B[ib]C[i hate that shape but i didn't see an alternitive]
;W[kf];B[lf];W[bb];B[ci];W[pn];B[qo];W[mo]TR[qn]C[this move caused me some problems and i don't think i made the best responce

pem: It's a peep. Just connect. W will reduce B's area, but B doesn't really have a claim, because of the bad shape at R6 played earlier.]

;W[ml];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[co];W[bo]
(;B[fr]C[pem: Better on G2 I think.];W[gr];B[hd]C[now that i am thick i go on the offensive

pem: It's hard to see how this will work. B should simply continue playing end-game moves, and let W worry about these stones. B should be able to get deep into the W center area by just threatening these stones, but not necessarily killing them.]
;W[he];B[gd];W[fd];B[ge];W[hf];B[gf]C[pem: This looks crude. W is getting stronger, and B is one step behind.]
;W[hh];B[ii]C[i was also thinking k10 might be a better net but i was worried it would get cut off itself

pem: I think K10 would work fine, W can't cut immediately. But this should do as well.]
;W[hi]
(;B[hj]C[pem: But this doesn't work. Should play J10 instead.]
;W[gj];B[ij];W[fi]
(;B[hg]C[pem: No good. Must play G9, and cut W off. Even if W manages to live, there's some possibility to capture the L9 stones.]
;W[ig];B[gg];W[ih];B[gk];W[ie]C[pem: Still a change, if B plays H8 now.]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[kg];W[ji];B[jj];W[hk]C[and i get out beacuse of aji]
;B[ik];W[hl];B[kl];W[fk]C[pem: So B got the three stones, but W connected out, which is much better than having to live small.]
