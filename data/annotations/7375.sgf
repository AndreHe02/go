R: Hi, my name is Can Nguyen. I'll be your reviewer today.]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[Jedo [8k\]: hmm
Jedo [8k\]: have we played before?];B[pc]C[AG4GO [8k\]: I think so]
;W[dq]C[Jedo [8k\]: k];B[qe]TR[pc]SQ[pj][qj][qn]C[R: Q17 is the right direction as it emphasises the upper side and to counter white's stone influence on the right. 

But your enclosure isn't that good - it doesn't work well with your lower stone (Q4) because your overall position is low, and your prospect of expanding on top is fairly limited because of the white stone at D16.

But it's not too bad - not a game breaker by any mean and it does secure a corner for you. 

As for why it's not optimal - at this position, think about where you'd place your stone on the right. 

Q10 makes an up-down-up formation with your top corner but it leaves too much room to slide in from underneath. 

R10 is too low overall, not very efficient. 

Enclosure at the bottom corner isn't very efficient either at this stage.

Normally people would choose Q15 - though it isn't as secure as your enclosure, it radiates influence both on top and works well with your stone downstair.]
;W[jd]C[R: right move by white - now imagine if your corner was P17 and R16 instead.]
;B[qj]C[R: too low - too slow.

Anywhere on the left is better];W[qh]C[R: White's creating a weak group within your sphere of influence. But that doesn't mean you should attack it directly.]

(;B[oj]C[R: while this is good directional judgement (IMO) because the upper right corner is solid, in the next few moves you left those 3 stones hanging and become the hunted. 

If you decide to attack - do so till you get a settled position or if you really want to attack the lower left corner then just play something like R7 first. 

R7 settles your group, White's R12 still doesn't have a base. If he plays elsewhere, you can later attack him by a cap at P12 or a shoulder hit and White will suffer if he wants to escape.]
;W[oh];B[ni]C[R: I still think a cap at N12 is better if you want to be direct about attacking this white group.]
;W[nf];B[mc]TR[ld][md][ke][lf]C[R: this is too low if you want to keep up the pressure. 

Any of the triangles is better. Aim for P13 later.];W[le];B[do]
;W[li];B[fp];W[gr]TR[fr]
(;B[fq]C[R: this exchange is bad for black. 

F2 would have been better if you want to press white low while keeping up pressure.]
;W[fr];B[mq]C[R: bad move.
1) you have no hope of expanding on the bottom side nor the right side. 

2) your moyo doesn't yield much point because of 3-3.];W[pm]

L5 threatens to kill the right handside group is better. 

F8 is not bad 

infact you can even try N10 for a squeeze then try to connect to your left hand side group and threaten that weak white group on the right.]

R: Overall, I think you've played ok but towards the end you seemed to lose your concentration. A lot of wasted moves towards the latter half. 

You even tried to save the very-dead-looking stones towards the end which made you lose the game.

The upper middle stones were probably your biggest loss. 

I don't know how much time you had left towards the end but if you could just stop for a sec and roughly counts the point you'd have made better judgements.

As for white, he's made some dubious moves in the beginning 
and he was lucky you made some serious errors on top and towards the end.

If you really want to move to a different part of the board, makes sure your groups are settled. 

Before you make a play in the fuseki, look how your stones would form potential framework. Likewise, when you play in your opponent side, look for an exit before you make that play. Play where your opponent would play to make the most out of their stones - dont' just throw stones in there and look for ways to manage it later.

I hope you've gained something from my quick review. 

Cheers,

A cap at N12 is very bad for white if white plays elsewhere and if he continues to run you can continue to rip the rewards elsewhere.]
