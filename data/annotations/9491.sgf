C[X: Hi, I'm Steve and my pseudonym on KGS and IGS is Xue. So I'll start all my comments with "X:" so you know it's me : )

X: Okay. The order of choosing moves in the early game is:
1) Do I have any weaknesses? If yes, fix them
2) Does the opponent have weaknesses? If yes, attack them! (or exploit them)
3) Take large points.
Always keep this in mind.

Also, always consider during an approach of the corner: should you pincer or should you answer? This depends on the global situation, and therefore also if you want corner territory or influence.

(;W[ed]C[X: (See first variation first) But what is the plan here? How do you plan on using the approach E16 to work together with your other white stones? And why is this more urgent than finishing the sequence in the bottom right? Would perhaps be better to approach from the other side, so white can actually then cooperate with the bottom left corner.

But anyway, nothing too eventful yet];B[cg]C[X: As black I would pincer here (a loose pincer would work well with top right, and start forming a double-wing formation), but this is also calm and okay.]

(;W[cc]C[Player comment - Since my opponent backed off the corner, I thought that taking it for myself would be a good trade for me.  I do not know if there are any joseki that exist for this variation.

X: This is not joseki, but it's not too bad.];B[dd];W[dc];B[ee]
;W[fd];B[fe]
(;W[gd]TR[dp]C[Player comments - I extended again because I believed that the fourth line territory I was taking was more valuable than the wall he was building on the outside.  I also considered jumping to H16, but was not sure if it would leave defects.  Looking over the game myself, I think that a one space jump would have been a more efficient move.

X: Your thinking is absolutely correct: taking territory on the 4th line, you should be very happy. Also black is making a big wall, but has nothing to use that influence with. If D4 had been a black stone, this wall would have been very good for black, but since it's white, the wall isn't so valuable. White's firm territory is much better.
Also, the simple extension is better than the jump.];B[cj]C[X: This is actually very slow for black, black should approach the corner directly.]
;W[nc]C[Player comment - I wanted to develop along the top seeing that I had a fourth line stone at G16.

X: Good thinking.];B[kd];W[ne]C[Player comment - This is where I believe I made my first crucial mistake.  My reasoning here is that I wanted to split the 2 black stones.

X: This isn't a mistake...
This is absolutely fine. The black stone L16 is alone and not very strong. So cut him off! Now  must choose: lose points on the right side, or lose the center stone.]
;B[pf]
(;W[hf]C[Player comment - I think this move was entirely unnecessary and gave my opponent time to run toward the center or settle himself while hurting my O15 and O17 stones.

X: This stone is a bit lukewarm. One thing white could do (or could also have done before approaching with O17) is a "leaning attack": this means you pressure one side to develop strength, then attack the other side. See variation. This stone is a bit in between attack L16 and leaning against the left-side group, and not doing either one very well.
But it's not terrible either.];B[kf]
(;W[qc]C[X: This is a mistake. As white, do you want the corner or the top-side? You thinking so far has revolved around extending the top-left group and using it to make territory on the side. But not you're invading the corner, forcing black to become stronger and neutralize your center.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[re]C[Player comment - This sequence was probably played too early, as my two stones are now trapped between two strong black groups.

X: As mentioned, this sequence isn't played just too early, it's the wrong sequence. This forces black to create a strong wall, which now works well with L16 and L14, while O17 and O15 are now weak.]
;B[qg];W[nb];B[oa]C[X: This is very greedy. White says "I want to have the corner, but I also want the side". Instead white should have let black keep a small corner, and taken the entire side.]
;W[mg]C[Player comment - Now I try to run into the center while putting pressure on the enemy stones.]
;B[kh]C[X: Remember also: when you want to make life, play contact. If you want to attack, usually you shouldn't play contact. So here, white needs to make life....]

(;W[lc];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[la];B[ic]
(;W[gb]C[Player comment - I played this sequence to try to settle myself, but it turned out that it gave black ample time to settle.  My territory in the upper left has also shrunk considerably considering the development I had earlier.

X: At this point this is slow! White is not yet in danger, but also there is no potential to make territory. So... not urgent, and not big. So play elsewhere! Unless you were trying to remove the black base to coninue the attack... but it's very difficult now...
If you are just worried about life, then better to take the base on the other side (see variation)]
;B[pj]C[X: After this, white must really struggle for life.]
;W[ld];B[le];W[oe];B[pe];W[me];B[lq]
(;W[qq];B[rq];W[lp];B[mq];W[qo];B[ro];W[mp]C[X: Hmmm... this seems like you can't decide which side to play on...]
;B[nr];W[oq];B[kq]C[Player comment - At this point I was completely lost as to what to do.  I would like some guidance on how to approach the board in this situation.

This is the point that I would like the game to be reviewed to.  Thank you very much!

X: Yes, from here on it is very difficult! : D
The main lessons I think are keeping an overview of the entire board and choosing in the opening keeping this in mind. The first thing means, think of how each move can cooperate with other stones. Which side should you approach from? It depends on which corners you have: after you approach do you want to just live immediatley locally, or extend back to your allies? If you want the side, you should approach from the side where you already have a stone.

Same thing with whether to pincer or to answer: which side do you want? this should depend on where your other stones are.

Also, always consider the outcome of invading: you take away a corner but give up the side. You can't have both! In go you don't have to destroy your entire opponent, just gain slightly more points.

Hope this helps and you can start making these considerations in your next games : )
