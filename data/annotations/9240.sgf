C[macac014 [16k\]: hi

N: Hello! My name is Nils and I am from Sweden. I have agreed to review your game. All my comments start with "N:". Hope you find them useful.]

C[is this the best way to defend?
N: Well, your stone is safe, but it's just one stone. There are much more important things to do. If he wants to waste a move catching that stone, let him.
Any of the marked moves would be much bigger.];W[jq];B[iq]LB[ip:A]
C[play j3 was a good idea?
N: No. If you were fighting for survival it would be ok. But as a general rule: a contact move makes your opponent stronger, being purely defensive. A shoulder hit (like A, diagonal, but not in contact) is agressive. What happens is that your opponent get two good white groups worth many points to the right and left. And you get a cluster of stones in the middle worth just a few points. That white loses most of the left side is a later mistake.]

LB[cf:B][cg:A]C[this move is a mistake?
N:No, this move is alright, but personally I would play A or B.]
;W[pl];B[nn];W[nl];B[pi]LB[ln:A][qo:B]TR[nn][pn]C[N: I don't like this move. The marked group is too weak. You have to do something about that first. Perhaps start with A and B. Later you can play q11.]
;W[ln];B[ql]C[this was a good move?
N: Not really. White could have cut you apart, see variations. However, in this tight spot you have to do something. It was the previous move that was bad.]

(;W[pm];B[rn];W[rp];B[qm];W[ok]C[N: Slow move ny white. Does nothing.]
;B[jc]LB[jd:A]C[N: Good move. Biggest move I can see. But I would prefer A. It claims more territory.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[nd]C[N: This exchange was good for you.]
;W[oi];B[pj];W[oj]
(;B[gn]TR[pe][qe]C[N: Now you got nervous. That group is not in big trouble yet. Keep attacking the weak marked group instead. See variation after move 42.]
;W[in];B[hl];W[jl];B[dk]TR[di]SQ[dg]C[this move was good idea?
N: In principle, yes. You squeeze the white stone between the two black ones and it works out well for you. I'm not sure about the timing. By that I mean that the fight you start now might get your group around g6 in trouble. It isn't safe yet.
N: Going over the game again I really think this was a good move, even if white hadn't played so badly. It works well with your top left corner and your bottom left group. d11 is under serious attack. After this you are in a big lead throughout the game, despite some serious mistakes.]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[ci];B[cl];W[bk];B[bj];W[dl];B[bl];W[og]
(;B[oh]C[play p 15 is better?
N: I think this move is better. You are safe in the corner. But see move 42-43. You should have played here first!]

N: To answer your main question: Your opening is not your big problem. You win this game with a large margin, despite to expensive mistakes (moves 111 and 149). You would benefit more from practising your reading. Correct timing in your opening moves is an advanced matter which you should focus on later, not when you are 16k (which you probably aren't anymore). Just a hint about such matters: It is very easy to just follow your opponent and respond to his/her moves. Your first thought should always be "can I play somewhere else and benefit more".
I hope you find this review helpful. It was fun to do.
