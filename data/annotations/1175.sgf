C[Hi, I played Black in this game. There
were several situation in which I did not know how to play. It would be
much help if you could comment this game. I added some questions, too.
It is not a very long game, only 100 moves before I had to resign...

Thank you very much,
Joerg.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[od];W[qk];B[qi]C[Would it be better to make a ssecond shimari immediately?

No, this is the right direction, I think.  If you make the shimari and then
white extends upward, your upper shimari loses some value.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[qg]C[This is a gross overplay for white.  Black is much stronger on this
side of the board, so white should play conservatively.  P6 or thereabouts
would be a fine move on this side of the board, threatening to enclose
black on the lower side.  E17 would be my choice of move at this point in
the game.  Black should gain a lot of thickness in this fight.]
;B[oi]C[Q12
maybe
better?

Not just maybe, definitely!

Black should attack aggressively since black has many more stones on this
side of the board.  Once white links up, black has no potential for attack,
and the game is as good as
over.];W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[ql];W[rl];B[pk];W[rk];B[qm];W[rm]
C[Black has gained some thickness here but not enough.];B[ed]
C[I
think black needs to play Q6 to finish the wall.  Then F4 would be a huge
followup.];W[pn]C[Now black's thickness is not so powerful.  White is
strong too, and has gotten out into the center with a definitely live
group.];B[om]C[Black could still wall white in
later with P6 but this would not be as good as Q6 would have been.  White's
sente move here is very big.];W[gc]C[Joseki???????????

This pincer looks like an overplay for white too.  Simply playing at D14
would be sufficient, I think.];B[fe]C[This looks like a good move for
black, threatening to attack G17.];W[dc];B[ec]C[???];W[mc]C[This is an overplay for white again.  Black
should punish it by playing at K17.  Black has the advantage here: 5 stones
to 3 on the upper side.  So black should not let white push him
around.];B[nb]C[too timid?

MUCH too timid.  Black's corner is not going to die!  The balance of power
between the E17 group and the G17 stone is what is important here.  Black
needs to attack G17 to make the E17 group get settled.];W[jd]
C[Now black has nothing!];B[lq]C[I did not know
where to play next, so I tried to gain some territory here, but maybe
this move is far too slow?

Indeed, the E17 group is very weak now.  White can play around D14 to take
territory while attacking it.  White will gain more on the left side than
black gets at the bottom.  Black should play around D14
himself.];W[dj]C[White is looking like swallowing up black's E17 group on a
large scale.  Black needs to defend it!

Letting white get such a good formation at the top is a big disaster.  O18
is a game-losing move.  Black has a weak group and didn't get any territory
to compensate for it.];B[fq]C[Is this the right side? Is there a more
urgent move? I
tried to forestall a white double-wing formation.

The E17 group is weak, so this is the most urgent thing.
1) where am I weak?
2) where is the opponent weak?
3) where is there territory?

The first question ALWAYS comes first.  Territory at the bottom is not
urgent at all.];W[fp]C[White takes a big left side and still aims at
attacking E17.];B[gp];W[fo];B[cq]C[good idea?

Yes, grabbing the corner is a good idea here since the lower side is not so
big with the low stone at M3.];W[dq]C[maybe I was luckky that
White played on this side.

No, white should play E3 and then G3 to make a strong group here, then
attack your E17 group all-out.  D3 is almost the same as E3 but doesn't
kill the F3 stone quite as clearly.];B[dr]C[should be at c4, i think

Yes, probably so.];W[er]C[noch glueck gehabt, dass er
nicht auf der anderen seite spielt.


I'm not sure I can translate, but yeah, white could get a pretty good
result at C4 instead of E2 now.];B[cr];W[eq]C[This is the wrong way for
white.  If white wanted this side, E3 in the first place is better.  Black
gets stronger shape this way.];B[cp]C[B5 is a better way for black to get out ahead of
white.];W[co];B[bo];W[cn];B[bn];W[gr]C[This is a weird move.  G3 is
better.];B[cm]C[Fehler!

Endspiel zug ????????

Yeah, it's not big enough to play right now.  It is pretty big though.  But
the urgent move is still to help your E17 group!  P6 looks less important
now that white has a strong group in the bottom left.];W[bl]
;B[cl];W[bk];B[bm];W[jq]C[This is a REALLY tiny move.  Neither side
is going to make much territory here.  White should be playing D14 to take
the territory while attacking.];B[ko]C[This is a tiny move too!  Neither
side is going to get much territory here.];W[eb]C[This is a mistake for
white.  It gains a few points in the corner but makes white's upper group
much weaker.  D14 is the right direction to attack from, I
think.];B[fb];W[db];B[fc];W[gb];B[gd];W[ic];B[ka]C[This is a big endgame move, maybe
too early? How could I make good shape with the black group in the upper
left corner?

You should not have played O18 earlier, but started attacking white then!
This move, though, is more than just big endgame; it's threatening the eye
space of white's group.  Actually M18 would be a little better I think.
This is the right way to defend your upper left group; attack white's
upper center group to make a fair fight.];W[cg]C[Should probably be high
(D14) for more attack.  Or even D15, a key point for the shape of this
group.];B[de]C[maybe around g12 better?

Black finds a great point here.  I think this sente move helps your eye
space a lot.  Move here first, and if you want to play G12 next that's OK
too.];W[ce];B[io]C[This move is tiny!  How many points does white make by
going here?  And in gote, too!  You need to play P6 first to have any
chance of getting a big center.  Then you can think about this kind of
move.];W[nq]C[Again white plays a little bit too aggressively.]
;B[op]C[maybe
at m2?

Yes, M2 looks like an interesting choice, but then white can almost link up
to Q6.  I think this way  is better; black should try to take some
territory in the center to make use of the J5 stone.  Aim at playing P6!]
;W[lr];B[np]C[I think K2 first makes better shape in the end (white has to
capture it).];W[mq]C[Letting white get M3 is like a free
gift.];B[kr]C[Doesn't K3, followed by N4, make
better shape for black?];W[kq];B[lp];W[mr]C[Ah, black is trying to take
sente, and the shape is good enough with the L5 stone to back it up.
Ok.];B[jf]C[Fehler!

keine bedrohung, keine funktion, kein gebiet in der mitte

If the idea of K14 is to try to make a big center territory, it's a little
too ambitious.  K12 or so would be better.  But this move might make an
interesting battle on the upper side (white is not yet definitely alive.
What will happen if black plays F19?)];W[jj];B[fa];W[hd];B[ie]
C[a mistake. better at h15?

Yes, because the black group is not definitely alive either, H15 defends
and attacks both.];W[he];B[hf];W[ge];B[gf];W[ff]C[i
made some big mistakes here, no hope.

Now it looks like your group might die.];B[ef];W[fg];B[eg];W[fh]
;B[ha];W[ga];B[hc];W[hb];B[ib];W[ia];B[jb];W[je];B[if];W[jc]
C[no way to get out. i resign.

Thank you very much for reviewing this game.

Bye, Joerg.

I think the key mistakes in this game were letting white link up to the R13
stone, and then leaving off the Q6 move to make your thickness really
strong (and also take some points on the right side: white might even have
answered Q6!)

But even bigger, playing O18.  At that point in the game, black could still
start a good fight on the upper side.  Instead, black takes a few points in
the corner and suddenly has a weak group with nothing to attack.

Attack and defense are more important than territory!  If you can take
territory WHILE attacking or defending, that's OK.  Otherwise, be sure to
find the URGENT move (looking at your weak groups and your opponents weak
groups) before the big move.

Thanks for sharing your game and your questions!
