C[zcacrgw [3k\]: hi gl

MR: Comments are included always starting with "MR:"

MR: The game is quite ok from white's perspective. Even after losing the upper right side corner (hint: play more flexible in enemie's sphere of influence) there are lots of opportunities for white to win (or better: not to throw away) the game.

If I should give you a hint on where to improve: 
Sometimes you seem to get lost in local fighting. Then you seem to lose sight of the "big picture", i.e. the areas you already invested moves to close three sides of a territory and now should close the remaining side, or to keep an eye on sente vs gote and sometimes take sente to make the big points.  

I commented the game until you kind of enter endgame.];B[qd]

(;W[ph]C[MR: White should step back and think about where he wants to get his territory. To compensate for the upper right corner, white needs to turn a large part of his moyo into territory. Because of B K16 he needs to think about the how.]
;B[qi]C[MR: In what follows, white builds an outside wall in *gote*. In my opinion, this is not the very best choice. White should rather be the first to play around J14 - the right side is not too important, it is anyway open at S5.]
