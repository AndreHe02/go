PW[Wang];B[dp];W[qd];B[pp];W[cn]LB[qn:a][dd:b]C[To early and unrelated. a and b are more natural
choices.];B[dl]LB[fp:a]C[a is simpler and better.

You play this move if you have the upper
left corner.];W[en];B[co]LB[fp:a]C[helping w to build up strength.

a is simpler and effective.];W[fo];B[fp]LB[fq:a]C[a has the same effect, but is safer.]
;W[dj]LB[bn:a][dn:b]C[No good. Black a leads to
overconcentration.

Black b might be possible too.];B[dn]C[Hard, but might be possible.];W[dm]
;B[bn]LB[do:a]C[Why not a?

W will end overconcentrated.];W[do];B[cp]LB[cm:a]C[Don't know about a.]
;W[bm];B[bo]C[Definitly to small.

You should be afraid of doing small moves,
which are not forcing or locally necessary.];W[dc]C[Leaving room for invasion. Looks better on
4-4.];B[bj]C[No good invasion point. Might even die.];W[cl]LB[ch:a]C[Why not a?

This creates a floating B group and makes
territory.

But maybe this move has the same effect.];B[dk]LB[ce:a]C[a looks more promising.

Again a small move which even helps white.];W[cj];B[ck];W[bk];B[bi]C[Not good.

Fighting for little.];W[ch]C[good.];B[cc];W[cd];B[dd];W[ce];B[bd];W[be]
LB[cb:a]C[No.

a, then connect, and B cannot live.];B[bc];W[ed]LB[db:a]C[Allows the corner to live with Black a.

White a would kill it.];B[db];W[ec];B[eb];W[gp]LB[fb:a]C[Shifting unfinished scenes, but a good move.]
;B[ep]LB[fq:a]C[Black a is certainly better.];W[go]C[Good.];B[gq];W[hq]
;B[gr]C[To small.];W[np]LB[qn:a]C[a is from the right side.

B cannot make much territory below. But W
can do so on the right side.

If W thinks about center territory, he might even
play in the center or at the top first.];B[nq]C[Should develop along the right instead.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[mq]C[No good for the same reason];B[pq]LB[qp:a][po:b]C[a looks much better.

Even b might be worth considering, trying to get
foot on the right side.];W[mp]C[To small.];B[mr]C[Again the false side.]
;W[ol]LB[po:a]C[Should play on a first.];B[qm];W[qk]C[good.];B[on];W[mm]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[iq]LB[hn:a]C[a sets up a ladder.];B[gn]C[does not work.]
;W[fn]LB[hn:a]C[Shoud cut at a.];B[gm];W[fl];B[ek];W[fm]LB[fk:a][gj:b]C
[b or just a are much better.

No need to be afraid of the cut.];B[mn];W[ln];B[io];W[im];B[lo];W[mo];B
[nn];W[ko];B[lp];W[lq];B[lr];W[kp]C[Unnecessary.

Each unnecessary move looses points!];B[po]C[Afraid of what?

And even then: to small!];W[jd]C[Ah finally a big point!

But a bit to vague.

Should be more to the left.];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc]LB[gd:a]C[Giving in to easily.

Why not a? B can live along the top.];W[gd];B[fc];W[fd];B[de]C[W need not answer!]
;W[ic]C[Good!];B[hb]C[To small!];W[ib]C[Same. To small!];B[cg];W[dg];B[df]
;W[cf]LB[bg:a]C[Avoiding the troubles with a.

This is a good strategy, if you cannot overview
the result.];B[bg];W[ee]LB[ef:a]C[a catches immediatly.];B[ae];W[ef];B[bf]
;W[od]C[Again big!];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[qi];B[oh]C[lost in foreign fields.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[qh];B[qf];W[pf];B[qe];W[pe];B[ph];W[pd]LB[rd:a]C[Come on! Unnecessary. a!]
;B[rh];W[ri];B[pm];W[oj]LB[nl:a]C[a is safer!];B[nl];W[nm];B[lm];W[ml];B
[nk];W[ok];B[pj];W[pi];B[kn];W[lo];B[jn];W[jl];B[ll];W[mk];B[jr];W[jo];B
[jq];W[in];B[hn];W[gl];B[hr]C[To small.];W[bh];B[ah];W[ci];B[ak]C[W is far ahead now.

B did to many moves, which were very small.])
