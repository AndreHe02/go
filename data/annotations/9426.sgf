C[Hello!
My name is Asaph, and I played as white.
I thought this was an Interesting game.
I wote a few comments but any advice would be welcome.
sorry if there are spelling mistakes
thank you in advance.

Hi!

My name is Vinyoo. I think overall you played well.

The area that you may need to careful is your invasion. Normally, to time the invasion is quite difficult. You tend to invade too early. It could cause the problem with your surrounding groups and gave black strong positions. However, if you invade too late, the invasion may not be successful and your group might got killed. In that case, you should consider reduction instead.

In general, it is better to be aggressive than to be defensive all the time. So, do not lose your edge just yet :)

To improve your skill in general, my advice is to play lots of games. Review them by yourself or discuss with other people. And doing go problems (tsumego). Most of all, have fun!

Feel free to contact me if you have any further question.

;W[jd];B[jp];W[hq]LB[dj:A]C[Here I consriderd A, but I thought that Black wold respond locally, allowing me to play A next move.]
;B[ho]C[this seprised me, Ithought black would play on the lines of K3 or K2,]
;W[kr]LB[lq:A]C[Since he didn't defend, I tried to take away Black's base.

--- Black move at H5 was OK. It is one way to emphasizing the center, though a bit unusual.

White move at L2 was not in the correct direction. In the opening stage, it is more important to get access to the center rather than playing on the 2nd line. Black can play at M3 for example and get a lot of influence in the center.

One possible move for white is F4. This creates potential territory for white and prevent future problems in this area.

L2 was also a bit too deep. To keep connection between stones, you should play K2 instead.]

(;W[ip]TR[hp]C[here Is W L5 better?
in the game Ithought since it is still in the opening, there was no need to start a big fight and I was stisfied with disconnecting  the H5 stone


--- The shape after J4 pushing is not good. Notice the empty triangle at H4. You should consider the move at J5 instead. See variation.

L5 will lead to a difficult fight for you since black is stronger in this area.]
;B[jo];W[io];B[jn]
(;W[dj]C[would white J6 here be sente?
I don't know so I took the big moove.


--- Black and white are "struggling to get ahead". You should not stop pushing yet. Black J6 is very good point for black.]
;B[in]C[--- This is bad for white.];W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm]
;W[go]C[my thought was to remove all aji, probebly should have played F6(?)


--- F6 is better. Black H5 cannot separate white group easily.]
;B[fm]C[--- At this stage, the game looks better for black. He gets a lot of outside influence and enclose bottom white group.]
;W[qh]C[here I was Trying a trick play, and get a ladder breaker for J7, I ended up getting it and mutch more...


--- Good thinking.];B[qg];W[ph];B[ob];W[rf]C[--- I feel that this invasion is a bit premature. White group is currently weak on both side.

After white settles down, the black outside influence will be more valuable than white's territory.]
;B[rg];W[qe];B[pe];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[qf];W[re]
(;B[pc]C[--- Black played a bit too loose. He should play at R18 to kill white. See variation.]
;W[qb];B[md]C[--- White was alive, but black got solid wall.]
;W[ne]C[--- Good decision to discard O17. Howver, Q12 group is more important.

White should play O12 instead.];B[nd];W[ng];B[kc]C[--- Black should play M14 to try to enclose white group.

If successful, the wall black creates from enclosing white will be useful for attacking white K16 later.

Playing L17 now will make K16 solid.];W[jc];B[jb];W[ib];B[lb]
;W[ja];B[kb];W[im]C[--- This cut created complication. However, it is still not easy fight for white.

Since white is falling behind, this move is OK.]
(;B[il]LB[km:A]TR[in][jn][jo][jp]C[--- This is wrong direction for black. He should develop from his weaker group (K6 group).

This move should be at A to pressure white's J7 and prevent shortage of libery of K6 group. See variation.]
;W[jm];B[jl];W[km];B[lo]C[I dont know why black didn't play L5

--- Yes, he NEEDS to play L5.];W[ko];B[lp];W[kn]C[--- Now white is VERY strong.]
;B[gi]LB[gk:A]C[--- This was too far. Black should play at A.]
;W[hk]C[I thought black would answer at H8 and then I'll try and surround the G11 stone]
;B[ij];W[hl];B[fk]
(;W[hi]C[my thought was to sacrifice the H9 stones to get influence at the top.

--- White is able to break through. See variation.];B[hj];W[gj]
;B[fj]C[--- Black should play at G9 to capture white's cutting stones.]
;W[ik];B[gk];W[jk];B[ii]C[--- Black should not give up K8 group. He should play at L8.

J11 was a bit slow. Black group was not in immediate danger here.]
;W[mn]LB[mm:A]C[--- This move was a bit thin. It should be at A instead. 

Black should cut white as in variation.]
(;B[no];W[om]C[--- Good move. Now white had some potential in the center.]
;B[pn];W[qo]C[--- This move was a bit overplay. White should not be able to live here. See variation.]

(;B[po];W[qq];B[qp]C[--- This move helped white. Black should play R2.]
;W[rp];B[pp];W[qr];B[qn];W[ro];B[pr];W[sr];B[dl];W[cg]C[--- Good play to connect your stones together. Black is very strong here.]
;B[hh]C[--- Another very slow move by black.];W[rn]LB[dc:A]
[hd:B][nj:C][cp:D]C[--- This was more of and engame move.

There are bigger moves out there such as A (secure corner), B (prevent invasion by peeping at H17, C (connection between top and bottom group), or D (secure corner).]
;B[rm];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[nj];B[rl]C[black played to small]
;W[ki]LB[dc:A][hd:B][cp:C]TR[qk][pl][rl][pm][rm][pn][qn][po]
[pp][qp][pq][pr]C[--- You cannot expect to make much territory here since marked black group is very strong here.

The move around A, B or C look bigger.];B[ck];W[cj];B[cq];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[co];B[bo];W[cr];B[br];W[bq];B[bp];W[bs]
;B[aq]C[was that the right way to handle the corner invasion?

--- I think white should just connect at D2 instead of B1.

The game move leaves D2 for black to capture white.];W[dc];B[ff]
C[--- This was a bit too shalow for black. Since his group is very strong here, he can afford to invade at H17.]
;W[gd];B[df];W[cf];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[es]C[--- White lost quite a bit of points here. 

I will end my review here. Hope my comments will be useful for you.]
