AB[pd][dp]C[Hello,

First of all, thank you for reviewing my game !

I played this game on IGS. I am playing black (my provisional rating is 13k) w\\
ith 2 stones of handicap against my 12kyu opponent.

I lost the game with 12.5 points but it could have been much worse.

I have commented my logic begind some of my moves, feel free \\
to critic my way of thinking and of devising a strategy. I think I have spotted and understood some of my mistakes but I need somebody's else point of view to know if I am thinking the right way. I stopped commenting moves when the endgame started. I probably do not play very well during endgames, but I feel that every game I loose is rather due to bad strategy in the opening/middle game, so this is were I want to improve my skills !


Cheers !
Maxime


Hello Maxime!

My name is Martin and I am going to review this game for you!

I hope you enjoy and learn something from it!];W[de];B[qq]C[With already 2 stones on the hoshis, I thought securing the last corner was\\
 a good way to start the game.


I think this is ok. More common to secure the corner is either Q3 or R4. An other good response to this is to play D17 right away.]
;W[nc];B[pf]C[Q14 is good as you have r3];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]
;B[qj]C[Good no need to answe r18];W[rb]C[You can tennuki here, Its so small and on the second line. D17 looks nice now]
;B[rc];W[jc];B[cj]C[Avoiding white to achieve extensions along both side from the the top-left stone.


I think its better to attack the corner while it still open! D17]
;W[qh]C[Despite my defensive move at R10  my opponent invaded. Is th\\
is a good invasion or is it too optimistic or too early ?


I think its a bit to early and Q11 would pressure this stone.. He should Q4 now instead.]
(;B[ph];W[pi];B[qi];W[pg]
(;B[oh];W[qg]
(;B[qf]C[With this move I was eager to secure territory but after this my group was \\
cut off from the rest of the goban by white. I could live but had the bad feel\\
ing that I had played in a bad way. Isn't black 20 better at P13 to keep conta\\
ct with the centre ?


I think p13 Would be the best move now, he cannot cut at p14]
;W[og];B[nh];W[of];B[rg];W[rh];B[re];W[sg];B[rf];W[ne];B[oj]
C[Alive but enclosed in the corner, i thought capturing the cutting stone was\\
 a big move that would give me, as a reward, a solid group with good influence\\
 toward the centre, although it is more oriented toward my stones ...


I dont think you need p10 better to play D17 or secure the corner. He would need to struggle to much with Q11 for it to be worth fighting for.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[op]
(;B[ro];W[oq];B[pn]C[I guess this move should have been played on the other side, right ? I shou\\
ld force white to extend toward my thick group in the middle

Yeah your wall in the middle is thick, you should use it for attacking and not to build territory.although he have Q9 in sente.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[lp];B[jp]C[So now as a result this move is too close from white strong group

I think its OK, W is not totaly alive yet and you might be able to push him around abit]
;W[fq]C[and my opponent punishes me for that move !

I think you are still ok];B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[fn];B[go];W[fo]
;B[jn]C[I am trying to escape to avoid too much casualties.]
;W[gn];B[ho];W[fk];B[cg];W[cl]C[Should I have defended here (or at D8) after F9 ?

I think you should try to fight att e7, Cut his stones!]
(;B[cm]C[I think this makes W stronger.];W[dl]
(;B[be];W[bd]
(;B[hc]C[I have big problems with invasions. As you will see, this one turned to a disast\\
er. I felt like it was time to invade, but maybe I failed in the first place by choosing the \\
wrong point.];W[ce];B[bf]C[maybe I should have extended from by invading stone instead of defending he\\
re ?];W[ec]C[Because from here my stone becomes very weak !]
;B[eg];W[gd]C[I guess E13 was a bad move,  I should have extended from my invading stone.\\
 Is that right ? I played this move because I didn't want to have a second gro\\
up cut off from the center if white had played here.

I think you are still ok.];B[id];W[gf]
(;B[fb];W[eb];B[gc]C[Maybe I should have use this stone to move out to the center, i.e. with J14 ?

Yes you should've.];W[jd]
(;B[he];W[ge];B[hg];W[hf];B[ig]C[Loosing move. Should've been K15 if you want to live]

(;B[io];W[jq]
(;B[ln];W[kp];B[ik];W[on];B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[mn];B[mm]C[a harsch fight followed from that. I probably blundered (more than once) as my opponent was eventully able to penetrate and rob a lot of my territory. However, he eventually blunder and I captured a big group of white stones.

I think this was a must from your side.];W[lm];B[km];W[ll]
(;B[kl]C[Maybe I overplay here ? I should have seen and defended the cutting point at Q7

Q7 looks safer indeed, I dont think M7 could've lived anyways!]
