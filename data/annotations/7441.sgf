Gear reviewer!

Thank you very much for reviewing my game and I would appreciate it if you can point at some weak points of my games that I should upgrade.

Regards,
Lovro Furjanic.

Hi, I'm Daniele. This is my first review, I hope you find it helpful. Anyway, in case you have any doubt regarding this game or question of any kind, please feel free to contact me.]

In chinese opening black can play 5 at Q9 or R9. I think your approach with O17 is good.]

****
You have a great wall (H15,G15...), so you can make some points in the middle.
A stone in M12 or L12 is better than G12 becose it makes points with the wall and helps your weak group on the right.]

with this ko fight you can take the upper side, but if black wins he saves his group in the middle and kills both your groups. Bad mistake for black...]

C[thanks for reviewing my game. I belive I was losing till the endgame where he made two mistakes that cost him a lot
****
You made two mistakes in the left side, black would have easily won if he had killed your group in the centre. 
I think you can improve a lot in the reading, I suggest you try to read out the whole sequences before you play.]
;W[tt]C[You can check your score with the score command, type 'done' when finished.
Click on a group of stones to mark it dead and remove it from the board.]
