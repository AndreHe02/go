AB[dd][pp][dp][pd][jj]C[Hi, I am hartz and I would try to point out some aspect that you didnt notice, imho, when you reviewed this game.

In general I do agree with most of your review :)]PL[W];W[nq]
;B[kq];W[mo]C[I guess tobi is better for white here:
 more strong and simple.];B[np]LB[pn:a]C[what is black intending to do?
cutting white stones?
It perhaps possible: enough blackforces.
However, he should have played security on east edge:  tobi from corner stone on 'a'

hartz: Good comment];W[mp];B[no]C[If black wanted to cut he had to do it know:
 more coherent with preivous move.
But remember:  "attaching to stones only to strenghten ones weak position."

Here black makes white more solidfor free.];W[lq];B[mr];W[mq]
;B[lr];W[kp];B[kr]C[no need to connect:  better playing on third line  -> making points.

hartz: true, and safer for the black stones also.];W[jp];B[jq]
;W[ip];B[lo]LB[jl:a]C[this _is_ a good move,
as it destroies black's influence towards middle of game.
For the same kind of purpose,
it would have been better to play tobi from middle board stone:
on 'a'

hartz: I think that while this move attacks white strongly, he is not worried at all because it is very premature as white has a lot of possibilities to run and even very good chances to kill black m2 stones.

I think the best move for black would be h3 making that stones safe. Remember that white is stronger than black as this is a H5 game.]
;W[lp]LB[ln:a]C[not very pretty: 'a' would also disable black to cut

allowing capture of black stone,

and rebuilding lost influence.

hartz: true m6 is better than connecting at m4, anyway trying to kill is unreasonable.]
;B[ln];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[oo]LB[po:a]C[bad move for many reasons:
1- no need to save those 2 stones:
there don't serve any goal; unusefull move is bad move.
2- it is a bad shape:
connecting would have been nicer whith the bamboo knot: 'a'

hartz: I agree about the bad shape but not about the black two stones, they are quite important. The strategic question is "Is black doing well attacking white this way?".

In my opinion he is not because it is leaving his shape full of holes and as white is going to live easily he could make lot of trouble later.]
;W[on];B[pn];W[lm]C[yeap: white shows how weak is black's position.
here the move captures one or two of the 3 stones.

hartz: Now you agree with me :)];B[km];W[ll];B[ml];W[kn];B[kl]
;W[ko]LB[lk:a]C[no: white should have played once more.
the two white stones are still captured yet:
better playing on 'a' for white.

hartz: true, black stones were dead, no way to rescue them]
;B[lk];W[ln];B[jn];W[iq]C[very good move:
should have been played earlier by any of the two players.

hartz: Again the same theme. It is far better to defend first so you can attack later. If not when your opponent counterattacks you have a lot of problems usually. Balance between attack and defense is needed. If you go for the killing and you ended being killed yourself it is very hard to win any game. And I say it for experience :(]
;B[jo]C[what is this for?

hartz: black is still trying to kill.];W[nr];B[io]C[dead angle is bad shape.

Hartz: this shape is usually called empty triangle.];W[jm];B[im]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[ho];B[in];W[il];B[hl]C[hartz: This is bad for black because white can cut directly at h7 and kill black. But nobody notice it ¡]
;W[ik];B[hm];W[hj];B[ij];W[hk];B[gk];W[gh];B[hi];W[pq];B[gj]
C[good white move: destroyes black's corner.
But, black's move is very good to:
very much power on middle of board for black now!   why did white abandonned that?
I don't think the corner is better at that time.

White move is localy good. But globaly it looks bad.

hartz: true, usually when fighting it is not good to play in another place. Letting you opponent capture center stones at the beggining is also bad, because you give him a lot of strengh in the center, just where it is more useful.]
;W[oq];B[qq];W[op];B[po];W[qr];B[qp];W[go];B[ns];W[os];B[ms]
;W[ps];B[rr];W[qs]C[hartz: this move is not needed. White was alive.]
;B[rq]C[hartz: Again not needed. White cant cut there.];W[ir]
C[hartz: very big, now black is dead.];B[js];W[is];B[oj]C[good move (better on 4th line)

hartz: In my opinion this move not only try to make territory along the edge but to defend against the n9 cut also. So it is fine in the 5th line.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[pf:a]C[that move should be played when black
yet has a stone on the oshi on white move's edge.

here, it's better playing tobi on east edge 'a'

hartz: Very good comment because many begginers get used to play the diagonal attachment when playing 9 and 8 stones handicap games and they play it later when it is not longer good like here.]
;W[kc];B[nd]C[good: white should have played ther first.];W[mc]
;B[lc]LB[md:a][ld:b]C[ouch: isn't black looking for some complication?
'a' looks stronger,
even 'b' could have been played,
allowing black to build nice influence.];W[ld];B[lb];W[md];B[kd]
;W[jc];B[jd];W[ic];B[id];W[gc];B[hc];W[hb];B[hd];W[kb];B[fc]
;W[gd]C[hartz: Black can now cut at g18. Look at the variation.]

(;B[ge]C[why not.
But since those 4 white stones in the upper right corner
are still able to connect,
capturing the two black ones,
that black wall isn't very powerfull.];W[fd];B[ed];W[ec];B[fb]
;W[dc];B[gb];W[mb]LB[ob:a]C[dead angle:
not very nice shape.
White wants to capture, secure his position..
 Ok.
Perhaps he'd better play hane on 'a'];B[fe];W[ib];B[cc]C[yes!]
;W[ne]C[hartz: this move is very small for white, he is not going to win this way. He should have played at r17 or c10 or c6 or r10.]
;B[od]C[not important stone.

hartz: I think it is good to connect because it defend the corner also.]
;W[mf]LB[lf:a]C[better shape on a

hartz: on this position i prefer the move white played because it leaves the opportunity of playing q14 later.]
;B[pb];W[oe];B[pe];W[oh];B[pi];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[qf];W[oi]
;B[qg];W[pg]LB[of:a]C[not very nice:
white can connect securely with the bamboo knot:
'a'

hartz: Again i prefer q13 than p14. Both are secure but q13 makes more points and leave not weakness for later.]
;B[qe]LB[pj:a]C[no: 'a' or by there is more important.

for securing a very nice amount of points.

hartz: true, q10 is big now. White cant cut at r15 because black can kill him easily with a ladder at s15, so r15 is not needed at all.]
;W[ke];B[ni];W[nh];B[nj];W[mi];B[qj]C[it was time! ;-)  black should have also played there before.]
;W[mh];B[mj];W[om];B[pm];W[ol];B[pl]C[what is white looking for:
he doesn't earn any point but constructs  very secure territory for black.
this is not good for white.

hartz: true, white has got nothing. Black is happy];W[pk];B[ok]
;W[jg];B[qk];W[hh];B[nb]C[Look now:
why is that huge part of the goban so empty?

:-) do you see it?

One of the 2 players should have played there a while ago!

There is especially big danger for black's hoshi
with that very powerfull white Wall.   I'm speaking about southWest corner.

It's important to see it.

hartz: Very important commentary. It seems that both players are so engaged fighting that have forgotten to play at the left side.]
;W[na];B[ob]C[hartz: now the corner is safe, so defending is very small.]
;W[la]C[those are yose moves: it is not time yet.

hartz: simply not needed.];B[oa];W[gi];B[jk];W[ii];B[hj];W[ji]
;B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[lh];B[ih];W[jh];B[ig];W[if];B[hg];W[hf]
;B[gg];W[gf];B[fg]C[very good from black.
But once again,
all those yose moves are very little money
in front of that empty West Edge.];W[ff];B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[fj]
;B[ej];W[fk];B[fl];W[ek]C[don't understand:
white doesn't know about ladders? ;-)

hartz: it seems so :)];B[dk];W[el];B[em];W[ef];B[db];W[cg];B[dg]
;W[df]
(;B[dh]LB[ch:a]C[don't understand that move:
better downstairs to block black's invading.
'a'

hartz: look at previous variation. It is safer for black to play d12.]
;W[ce]C[Black is winning here.

you can see it easily:
east edget any group, while white doesn't have much territory.

Things are still possible with that lonely hoshi
in front of such frightning white wall.];B[jf];W[je];B[kf];W[lf]
;B[ie];W[le];B[dl]C[why? this is a lost move!

hartz: open ladders are always a threat because white could play a ladder break move at c6 for example, so if black feels he is leading, it is not bad.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[cd];B[bf];W[cf];B[bg];W[bh];B[eb]C[here too:
why capturing?
even if there is some aji,
those stones are done yet.

hartz: very true.];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ac];W[ad];B[ab];W[bi]
;B[bj];W[cj];B[di];W[bk];B[ck];W[aj];B[ha]C[no:
black has to close the border line on b8.

hartz: H19 is very small, just one point in gote. Any move at LL corner would be far bigger.]
;W[ia];B[ga];W[bl];B[bm];W[eq]C[there we are,
a bit late and in the wrong direction imho:

white's policy should be to push black's stone toward the wall,
making some money (points) by the way.

That is, playing around the san-san.];B[dj]C[black makes tennuki?
for the less value move:
half a point.
No,
here black _has_ to answer to white move.

Hartz: you are right :)];W[dq];B[bj];W[ai];B[cj]C[hartz: very small for black]
;W[ak]C[hartz: not needed for white];B[cl];W[cp];B[do];W[bp]
;B[ep]C[Black lost very much points not defending his corner in time:   perhaps is it a 30 points difference...

hartz: yes, around 30 points. And black again makes an empty triangle.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[gq];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[cq]C[hartz: it is not needed]

;W[jr];W[nl];B[mk];C[Didn't count: felicitations to both of you.

This is my first review, and i liked it.

Thanks.

Hartz: I dont know who asked for the review, but black should not attack so fiercely without defending and white should play more lightly not helping black to became strong.

I think most of the comments are useful and I agree with you usually, but I think it is very nice for the players to look at variations for other possibilities and you havent included any.

It is also very helpful to explain at the end of the game where is the weakest point of the players, for example black dont defend properly and attack too much. White plays to close to his stones and helped his opponent to make territory too easily.

I hope this review of the review would be of help to you. Please ask me any question you have.]
