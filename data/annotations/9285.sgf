C[Hello dear reviewer,

I play here as black (nocebo). My opponent is an acquaintance of mine and we had played real games: we are both interested in the review. He is a bit stronger than me. We played with french Aga rules on kgs (filling dame for instance).

Beyond the comments, I ask for your help: how to get stronger in go?Â I now try to concentrate on my games (foreseeing moves as much as possible, take care of time, applying the basic strategic principles) rather than books, tsumego or joseki I long studied (and forgot).

I put some questions we both asked ourselves and cleared our talks.
Thank you in advance,
nocebo

[Nexik\] You should study tsumego. You have a lot problems with reading. White on other hand should study position judgment and how to handle big moyo without big fights or invasions.

If you both want to be stronger you should ask yourself before every move this question: Do this move improve my situation greatly? If not try to find another move. You play a lot of very slow and not interesting moves.

I don;t suggest to look for something brilliant. If you can't find great move it is ok to play slower move but be sure you know what you are doing.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[nq];B[pj];W[nc]C[[Nexik\]Both variation are better than the game. If you want to pincer it should be at M17]

(;B[dg]C[Useless as long as n17 is still open according to my partner.

[Nexik\] Not useless but not so big. On other hand this is also wrong move locally. See variation for proper one]
;W[cg];B[df];W[lc];B[le]C[[Nexik\]Connecion would be more natural]

(;W[rp]C[[Nexik\]White play solid. Probably think he is leading a lot and game is easy for him]
;B[on]
(;W[dh]C[[Nexik\]Again very thick move, but N6 would be better]
;B[mp]C[It sounded good, like a kata, but white thinks it's a "between two" move : not really preventing the bottom formation and not really making black's moyo growing
