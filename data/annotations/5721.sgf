AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi! I'm your reviewer Edgar Ibsen. My comments will start with "Edgar: ".]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[cf];B[ch];W[fq];B[cn];W[mp];B[hq];W[qn]
(;B[kq]C[Edgar: I believe this is a mistake; see my comment two moves after.]
;W[oo];B[nq]C[olligo [7k\]: Looking for a way to save the corner - O3?

Edgar: Well... at this point even if you save the corner you will still incur quite a penalty insofar as influence is concerned; and the L3 group will be weakened quite a bit.

I believe L3 is a mistake. H3 is in no immediate danger, but Q4 is already pincered. If you had played O3 instead of L3 you would be able to play P6 after White responds with N3 (see variation).

P5 is a huge move for white; it unites his two potentially weak groups, and seriously threatens the corner, therefore allowing w to play P5 is a mistake.

If you want to save the corner here, you will need to play R3 or R4 (I perfer R3 though, though R4 possible) at some point. And this shows the problem: even if b lives, he'll end up with a very small chunk of land, and give white huge influence.

I think the root of the problem here is that you are being too greedy. You want to deny white everything, but that is impossible in Go, unless he is much much weaker. The trick is to come out ahead in exchanges, and not to deny everything.]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[mr];B[qj]C[Edgar: No! This is *way* too greedy. As the saying goes, urgent moves before big moves. Your Q4 group is in danger of dying. Remember that the 4-4 stone *never* means free life; in fact, it means the opposite - namely that you need to add a move in gote in the corner to live.

Hence, while R10 may be big, it is way smaller than the R4 required here for life in the corner. Though, even after R4 black still has bad aji in that corner. But this is the price to pay for ignoring the pincer.

Again, remember that you do not "own" any part of the board at the beginning of the game (even in a 4H game), and any attempt to get everything will make you lose.]
;W[rp]C[olligo [7k\]: was there no way to save the corner from here?

Edgar: Probably not, unless you are much stronger than white. I personally can't see a way for b to live there; there is just not enough eyespace.]

;B[dk];W[hm];B[im]C[Edgar: This move is too hasty. You are giving white, who was comparitively weak, a chance to fight you and potentially seriously harm you. Attaching to a running group should be done with extreme care, because more often than not it helps the running group and not the side who attached.

Here, a much better move might be G9. It at the same time expands your huge moyo, and also attacks white. Actually killing white will prove hard; this seems to usually be the case for low 5-3 approaches (i.e. F3) with a 4-2 leg (i.e. D2), especially since the group already has a sente eye at E2.]
;W[in];B[hn];W[jn];B[ko];W[jp];B[kp];W[ip];B[hp];W[gm];B[ln]
;W[km];B[il];W[jr]C[Edgar: Now it is your group that is more likely to die, and not white's. This happened because of the hasty attach. Attaching should be done only when there is enough support, but your H3/L3 group was quite weak when you attached, partly also due to the mistake in the corner. Now you see why trying to get everything is a bad idea ;) You usually just end up killing your own groups.]

[ll][kp][hq]SQ[fq][jq]C[olligo [7k\]: I used 5 min to decide on O8 - still looking for a way to capture K6 group

Edgar: Trying to capture K6 at this point is more or less daydreaming lol. You should be fighting for the survival of N5, since at least H3 is already pretty dead.

We can compare the group situation on the board right now. B has 4 weak groups, while W has 2 weak groups (actaully F3 is probably already alive, or at least can run into the center). There is absolutely no way B can capture either of W's weak groups unless W blunders; saving even one of his two larger weak groups is hard.

Again, you were trying to kill white too hard, and the hasty attachment shows this. But this is something that you have to get over in order to advance... I still remember I was similarily vicious when I was a 7k ;)

More interesting than killing groups is to get something while chasing them (like the G9 I proposed). Especially for a group that is very hard to kill.

Anyway, this is another manifestation of being too greedy.]

Edgar: You were just too greedy ;) Though to be honest, learning when being greedy is ok and when it is not is not easy; for example, you need to be able to accurately feel how hard killing a group is, and that takes experience.

So play more games, and turn down the greediness a little ;)]
