C[Hi,
I will be greatful for any comments about good and bad moves, but especially about direction of play in fuseki and moves in center.

Big thanks for review.
Paul

-------------

Hello,
my name is Holger and I will be reviewing your game.
Please be patient with me since this is my first review on GTL.

After looking at the game, I have a few comments.
In the opening game, you should be clear whether a stone is played for building moyo, or for securing territory. "In between stones" generally do not help for either goal.

In the course of the game both players focused on the center, while the top side was still open. Be sure to roughly settle the sides, before you move into the corner.


In the following, my comments will start with H];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[lq]TR[pj][jp]C[H: This move does not enclose the corner and is too slow for building up moyo. If you want to build a framework, K4 or Q10 are a lot better.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[qj]
(;B[ql]C[H: Again, this jump is at least one space too far. If B played at R7 it would help to defend against the white invasion later on. (see alternative)]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qq]C[Isn't it too early for this move?
H: Yes it is quite early. It would have been better for white to build moyo on the left side. But this invasion works, because the two stones at M3 and R8 are too far away.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[pr];B[or];W[ps]
;B[os];W[rr];B[nq]C[H: Here you see, that the stone at M4 did not help in defending the corner. If you played it for building moyo it would have been a lot better at K4]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[cn]
(;B[cf]C[I didn't know from which side I should attack white's corner. But if I played at F17, he might extend along left side and gain big influence.

H: That is true, but you would have gained influence on the top. As a rule of thumb, one should always prefer to attack from the outside.]
;W[fc];B[cj];W[ce];B[df]
(;W[ck]C[H: White shouldn't attach to the black stone. This move is too close.]

(;B[dj]C[H: The right answer to contact play in this situation is to hane. See variation]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[el];B[fk];W[fl];B[gl];W[gn]
(;B[in]C[H: This move doesn't accomplish much. The biggest move on the board right now is on the top]
;W[hm]C[H: This move starts a sequence where you fight for the center. But the top is still open and has a lot more points.]
;B[hl];W[im];B[jn];W[il];B[ik];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[jk];W[kl]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[kk];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[li];B[lh];W[ml]
;B[nl];W[nk];B[ol];W[ok];B[gm]
(;W[hn]C[H: No need for white to connect. The white group in the center lives]
;B[fm];W[em];B[fn];W[fp];B[fo];W[go];B[ho];W[hp];B[io];W[en]
;B[ip]
(;W[gp]C[H: Again, white doesn't need to connect. The stone is only worth one point.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[ep];W[eq];B[gj];W[gq]C[H: Unnecessary, white should rather play at the top.]
;B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[hs];B[is];W[fr];B[rj]C[This move was bad.
But I didn't see, and know, that he might invade so deeply.

H: Again. Black should play on the top first.];W[gh]TR[jc]SQ[fg]
[gg]C[And when he did it, I didn't know how to respond.
Maybe I should sqeezed him with move like G14?

H: This is a bad move by white. Black G14 would certainly have separated this stone from the top.
On the other hand, there is no territory there yet which black can claim. Black only has strong influence.
If white wanted to reduce black's territory, I think F13 or G13 would have been better. 
And of course there is still K17]
(;B[fh]C[H: Never attach to a weak stone. You will only make it stronger.]
;W[fi];B[gi]
(;W[ej]C[H: This move is not dangerous for black.]
(;B[fj]C[H: Black is too afraid. Just keep white inside.];W[ei]
;B[eh];W[di];B[ci];W[dh];B[dg];W[ch];B[bh];W[bj];B[bi];W[bk]

;B[de];W[cc]
(;B[fd]C[H: Too timid. See alternative];W[gc];B[be];W[cd];B[bd]
;W[bc];B[jc]C[H: This move should have been played a long time ago.]
;W[ic];B[jb];W[ib];B[jd];W[jf];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf];W[kg];B[lg]
;W[kh]C[H: The following sequence will be about 2 points for white, while P14 is important for both players]

(;B[si]C[H: These are just four points at the right. An invasion at the top is worth a lot more.]
