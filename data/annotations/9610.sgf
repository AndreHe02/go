AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Dear Reviewer,

I am a beginner and would be happy if you could tell me the main reason why I lost this game.

R: Hi, I'm Riani and will review this for you. I'll try to give you comments to improve you game overall. If you have any quesitons about this review, don't hesitate to send me an email!
Summary: your problems end up with the loss of that group, but it would have been easier to have never gotten in that position. Take a good look through this game, it should be instructive: Overall, you play too gently. Don't be afraid of white's stones: they aren't magic! I put out a few variatoins for you to look at over all, but the main idea should be to play calm, but firm in a handicap game.]
PL[W];W[qf]C[R: So from the beginning, you're aobut 80 points up (that's the usual estimate). This is a standard appraoch.]

(;B[pf]TR[pj]LB[qe:a]C[Hanspeter Schmid (hanspi): Have a very good game!

R: While this is possible, there are better ways to play here that take advantage of the marked stone. (A for example, see variation.)]
;W[qe]C[R: This is not a standard response. As soon as I see this move, I have pegged my opponent as a territorial player. What can we do to stop/reduce him from getting territory? Take some ourselves or have solid influence.]
;B[nc]C[R: This is actually a good response here.];W[cn];B[bn]
C[This may have been weak, as Linus cuts immediately.

R: This is a possible move but it's a trick move and gets complicated quickly. I included the best simple variation. White doesn't get tricked in the game, so we could call this a loss.]
;W[co]
(;B[dm]LB[cm:a]C[R: I don't understand this move. A is natural for white, and b just concedes terrtiroy. While it does look like an influence move, it's not as solid as other options that may be better.]
;W[cm]
(;B[dl];W[cp];B[ep]LB[dq:a][nq:b]C[R:This does nothing for you. Choose A instead if you want to still play here. It does kind of help the cut, but there are bigger fish to fry. (B would be fine, for example)]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[Correct, and fine here.];W[pr]
(;B[pq]LB[qq:a]C[R: This is slightly problematic. A would have been better.
The attachment you play later in the game is also a viable option here.]
;W[qr]C[R: This is sente. It shouldn't be this big of a sente though. (threten to loose whole corner.)]

(;B[qq];W[fc];B[eb]C[This sweep is nice and territorial. B can be happy with ths here.]
;W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[I am trying to connect my stones ...];W[cd]
(;B[df]C[R: a bit passive. Hane here, instead.];W[ce];B[de]
;W[cf];B[cg]C[R: a hane 2 stones too late, but better late than never.]
;W[pe]C[R: Looking at the board up to this point you're not doing bad. You have plenty of potential on the bottom and right side, the top can still be something, and the influence you built on the left can be helpful.
Therefore white wants to start a bit of a fight to figure out where s/he should focus.]
;B[oe];W[qd]
(;B[ph];W[pc];B[od];W[pb];B[ld]LB[lq:a][cq:b][nb:c]C[R: Wasted move.
A, B, or C would be better here.];W[ma]SQ[fc]C[This move I really don't understand. Why would he set  stone on line 19 here?

R: This is an unusual move for sure. IT would usually be saved for  the endgame, but if he can connect this and the marked stone, your entire top becomes useless, and either way he gets a reduction. This also shows why your last move may be considered wasted.]

(;B[lb]C[R: a fine response.];W[la];B[mb];W[na];B[ob];W[oa]
;B[kb];W[ka];B[ib]C[Does this give me higher losses than it gives him?]

(;W[kq]
(;B[mq]C[It's a little late for this attatchment.
Furthermore, the time you spend defending this stone is precisely what allows him to get out and start trouble. There are simpler alternatives here.
Even though he gets out in the alternate variation he can do much less damage/more manageable damage that way. Black should never be the one to complicate things in a handicap game, and this is exactly what happens here.]
;W[mr]
(;B[kp]C[R: block instead, since you make more territory on the lwoer left this way.]

;B[nr];W[lr];B[oq];W[pl]C[Later in the game, I will lose a big stone group in the middle. Would I have been able to prevent this right here?]
;B[om];W[ol]
(;B[pm]C[R: your gruop in the corner is strong enoug, this move isn't needed. I would do something about his connection instead.]
;W[ql];B[nn];W[nl];B[no];W[cq];B[dq];W[cl]
(;B[ci];W[ck];B[dk];W[jm];B[im];W[il];B[jk]C[R: Don't peek if you can't cut.]
;W[jl]
(;B[ji]C[R: This feels like you're inviting him to pick a side. You pick the one that matters more and let him fight you for the leftvoers.]
;W[hk];B[hi];W[mi]
(;B[gf]C[R: I assume this was to keep the marked stone in? Good idea, but that matters a little less than the destruction of your territory on the right. A lot of your points are evaporating right now.]
;W[mg];B[jg];W[lf]
(;B[me]C[R: There are so few ponits to the right of that stone. Aim left to prtoect something bigger.]

;W[mj]C[R: This stone removes the possiblity of the cut.];B[mk]
;W[lk];B[nk];W[oj]C[\]
(;B[oi]C[R: Surrendering hte se stones this way was probably good.]
;W[nj];B[qg];W[rf];B[rg];W[qc];B[qk];W[kg];B[le];W[mf]C[I think here he did not see the Atari]
;B[kf]C[R: The capture is right.];W[kh];B[jh];W[of]C[R: This is the problematic cut we've been watching for a while. Now it's sente.]
;B[pg];W[og]LB[rk:a]C[R: Doesn't really hurt you, particularly if you played A instead.]
;B[oh]
(;W[nh];B[rk]C[R: THis works, but he didn't have to let you have this. See variation.]
;W[sk];B[sj];W[sl];B[ri];W[pk]
(;B[qs];W[os];B[ja];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj]C[And now I realise that a big group of mine around P12 is lost.]
;B[nb];W[pa];B[fd]TR[gf]C[R: Not needed right now. This also defeats the point of the marked stone that you played earlier.]
