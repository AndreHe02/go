C[Hello, my name is Ian Davis, I hope you both enjoy my review.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[jp];W[cn];B[en]C[So Black is hungry for a moyo game !]
;W[bp]C[yes white can establish himself on the side this way quickly]

(;B[cq]SQ[pj][qj]C[I wonder if Black really wants to make this move.
It is possible to play on the other side, aiming for super moyo. Just an idea anyway.]
;W[dk];B[bq]
(;W[co]LB[bo:A][co:B][cp:C]C[Do you know if it matters how I connect?

Peronally I would play C normally. Again as with Black's move at san-san (c3) I am wondering if white can also tenuki here..]
;B[oc]C[a good point to take]
(;W[pe]C[white can also consider a pincer here.];B[lc];W[qi]
;B[qg]LB[fc:A][qm:B]C[This move looks foolish but I could get an advantage.  As soon as I  use the thickness from the the lower 3 star point moyo develops as fast as this thickness.

I don't like this move at all actually, it is very jealous. I would play either at A or B]
;W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[ri]

C[Now he's alive, so my only trade off is thickness.  Can you spot something which is poor play regarding the use of this thickness?

i can try ;-)]
(;W[ic]LB[cf:A]SQ[fc][lc]C[well I am not happy with this pincer - why? White pincers Black, but he is also pincered himself. so I prefer a move at A]
;B[db];W[cc]
(;B[cf]LB[hd:B][fe:A]C[this is again very jealous play by black. How many groups do you want to create? I would prefer A or B]
;W[df];B[ce];W[de];B[ch]
(;W[gd]C[Looks like this must be dead, but I couldn't kill it.

With this approach you are going to seal it in at least, it is also possible to make it run out]
;B[fd]
(;W[fe]LB[ge:A]C[a little soon, but a common mistake ! correct move is A.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[hb];W[ib];B[cb];W[bb];B[fb]C[looks alive now]
;W[dc]LB[le:B][bj:A]C[well this won't kill, just a dame point i'm afraid

As white I would try A or B to press against those black groups.]
;B[ec]C[alive! ??
... yes];W[pb]
(;B[pc]C[black shows no fear, but it is important to make eyes. Note how living in gote on the top left hurt the group on the top right !]
;W[qb];B[ob];W[md]C[it is a good idea to press down like this]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[nd];W[ne];B[kb]
(;W[kd]C[variation is an attempt to kill, but isn't it bad to try to kill before he is boxed in? 

You get a good result from enclosing black, so it is hard to criticise it, if you can't see how to kill outright I advise squeezing first]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pa];W[rb];B[od]
(;W[dh]C[Now I am thinking forcing him to run would have been better.


look at that moyo ! White should be celebrating.]
(;B[ci]C[a slight error];W[di];B[cj];W[jk];B[mk];W[lj]LB[gk:D]
[ll:A][jm:C][mm:B]SQ[dp][gp][jp][mp][pp]C[i don't like this. Is this how we use thickness?

Why not playy A or B and start asking how black is going to live + hurting the bottom. I feel black has pushed too far with this move. For me Black should have played around C, or D. For if you want  to reduce D has more aji to do so.]

;B[dj];W[ej];B[ek];W[el];B[fk];W[dl]LB[bl:A]C[now a move at A asks questions of white on how he plans to live ! Here it isn't easy for white to attack any Black invasion]
;B[ei]C[yes Black is connecting, but B8 is much bigger. White cannot take gote to defend this cut.]
;W[eh];B[fj]
(;W[oj]LB[bk:A][mm:B]C[This must be too small.

Yes it must be. I see only 2 ideas
A - make life
B - try to make a really big kill];B[oe];W[nf];B[mq];W[qq];B[qp]

(;W[qo]C[I guess this was foolish of me.

no given the local situation this move is fine, you can ask if K7 is bigger I guess]
;B[po];W[qn];B[ik];W[ij]LB[jj:A]C[A move for white at A was slightly better shape]
;B[jl]
(;W[iq]C[desperation.  I am behind if he closes this off, I think.

Desperation indeed! The white group on the left doesn't seem so alive]

Black - too many greedy moves. Go needs patience sometimes.

White -( besides the unreasonable play at the bottom) , maybe focus on your attacking technique a little more. Some times your threats were not sente for instance.]
