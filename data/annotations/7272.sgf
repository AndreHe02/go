For any related questions, feel free to contact me on kgs.
I tried to sum up my comments at the end of the game, i hope it will be helpful. Enjoy !]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[cf];B[pj];W[nc]LB[lc:A][pf:B]C[How should I handle this move?

- There are many possibilities, but only 2 of them are recommended :  A or B 

A : is inviting white to jump into corner, so that black can get a wall out of the exchange, and potential at top.

B : will allow white to take top. I can't recommend it here, thanks to white's position in top left corner, white would be too happy.]

(;B[lc]
(;W[ne]C[Jumping here  can be unusual, in those cases, just keep in mind what your strategy is : keep right side.]

(;B[ic]
(;W[qc]C[as white i would be more tempted to play Q14 to punish black for not extending earlier. Let's see how to punish.]

(;B[qd]C[if you push here, you have absolutely no choice but to cut.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nd]
(;B[qg];W[mb];B[lb];W[nq]C[I probably should've played q6 or r6 here, but I never know which.

Play Q6 when you think you can build some potential.
If it's not possible, play more territorially with R6.

Here i would recommend Q6, to make Q10 work more efficiently.]

A few tips you would like to remember : 

1/ Try to keep in mind what your strategy is and stick on it  ( the fuseki on right side was not very consistent ) That will help you improve your " direction of play" skills. Keep wondering " what do i want, how can i get it ?"

2/ Try to think a bit more sometimes ( you missed an easy kill on right side)

3/ When the opponent plays strangely or plays something you had never seen before, try to play simple ( just split him, make your groups safer )]
