AB[pd][dp]C[I won this game by a half a point and i think i played well but since it was my closest game i figured it was best for review

Congrats! Playing handicap games is very tough. The key idea (in all go really) is that you should aim to win by 0.5 points. If you win by more than that it means you opened yourself up for counterattack at some stage by overreaching. That is why pro games usually end with <5 point difference.

Also, moves become worth less and less as the game progresses: with the first 10 moves white can regain much of the handicap while the same 10 moves in the midgame will be much more difficult to do much with.

So your plan when playing a stronger opponent with a handicap should always be to gain as much from your moves as he does from his, since you're already ahead to start with. Only attack when you think you're going to fall behind in the next few moves and need to make a play to prevent that. Play calmly! Here goes...]
PL[W];W[dd]
(;B[pp]C[Great. Calm.

If you know the joseki I'd recommend playing 3-4 with this stone as it is much more stable.

Remember, white is behind, he NEEDS to find a chink in your armour. You must not show him one.

Let's look at the big moves available to him...]
(;W[jd]C[Pretty fine.]

C[I've been trying to experiment with the 33 invasion

There are times when the 3-3 invasion is good, but the opening is pretty much never one of them.

Think of the 3-3 invasion as being worth 20 points. Right now there are bigger moves on the table. 3-3 point is extremely annoying for someone who holds the 4-4 point as it cannot be killed. Even with the knight's move enclosure it cannot be killed outright, so this means it would take white 2 more moves in that area to ensure that he has that territory.

This makes the 3-3 point an incredibly useful threat! Very few ko-fights are going to be worth more to white than having you play 2 moves in a row in his corner. Don't waste ko threats.

That is all quite high-level (which you're becoming btw - 18k is getting to the meat of the matter imho and as your own comments clearly show) Most importantly of all, 3-3 steals territory but gives massive influence to your opponent.

This makes it a super good late mid-game invasion as the board will be so full of stones that there's no way for him to use his newfound influence. In the early game the opposite is true. The triangles are currently worth around 40 points EACH, so think of it this way, if someone came along and told you you could put down black stones on all the square points right now but it would cost you 20 points later, would you take it? I certainly would. You just gave that to your opponent.

The fact that you won this game shows that you are quite a bit better at the mid-game than your opponent - unless he made some terrible mistake. Basically, After this exchange your opponent has probably made up the 1-stone lead you had on him.

Maybe it's too early to say :D];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[cf]
;B[db];W[eb]
(;B[gd]C[i wanted to steal whites influence without playing to close to his wall thinking if he put pressure on the stone i might be able to run or set up a base

3-3 means you took his territory in exchange for giving him influence, you cannot have your cake and eat it, too. You must respect your opponent by letting him have what is his (and taking just a bit more than he gets, every once in a while.)

Another way to think of this is ... can you give him this much territory and get even more yourself? Then you can let him have it - you may even be able to invade him later, when you have more supporting stones in the area, see the variation.

This is the kind of move that he wishes with all his heart you will play. It makes optimal use of his K16 stone and his D16 wall. So not only did you give him strong outside influence with the 3-3 invasion, you are now also making it as useful as could be. If you were white, is there anywhere you'd rather have black attack you? I think you saw yourself getting behind in that area, while forgetting that you are uncontested everywhere else and can freely spread your framework like the plague.]
;W[cb];B[bb];W[da]
(;B[gc]C[i don't know why i played their

Lol, yeah, the other way might have been better if you really felt like pushing the attack

See variation];W[nc];B[jc]C[trying to get a base take territory

This is a good move - this whole play is pretty good, just not in the early game. Say you played 10 more early game moves like the corner approaches, etc. Then arguably the white stones would be placed exactly as they are now but your black stones wouldn't be there, they'd be solidly defending or approaching elsewhere.

Then, you could look at white's structure (say, exactly as it is now) and choose where to attack. You would also decide whether you want to kill, or just press him low. Maybe prod from a distance to get him to play awkward responses. I would consider playing Q18 / P15 / A9, etc. Never risking anything but limiting his options while building your own potential.]
;W[ld]C[he is being too soft];B[lb]C[nice!];W[qf]C[i really dont like the pincers so i don't know if i played this well

Very interesting situation. The best you can hope for now is to live small in the corner. If he makes a mistake your could *maybe* connect underneath to M18. Your best bet is to feint as though you want to connect, while really just trying to get another stone on the board to help out...see variation]

(;B[nd]C[trying to maybe cut and connect to white group

This is a good strategy - it basically says "i'm not willing to live small in the corner while giving you a big wall towards the center - I'd rather run away into the open space and use that influence to chip away at your armour.]
;W[oe]C[This is good because you have to respond and he gets another stone to help settle his R14 stone.

He is letting you cut his top group though, but if you cut it he cuts off your corner stone and may even kill it and take the corner.]
;B[od]C[I would do the same.];W[mc]
(;B[kd]C[This is not really a cut as it gives him sente]
(;W[ke]C[I would probably play the opposite if I were white.]
;B[kc]C[nice one. solid, settling your group and he has lots of cutting points for later.]
;W[id];B[lc]TR[pb][gf]C[Ponder this move: what did you gain and what did he lose? You gain nothing and force him to connect his stones, making him strong. I would choose between the triangles at this stage. The G14 move is a very good mid game move, jumping from an iron pillar while cutting two opponent groups is huge, but Q18 settles your corner stones and threatens the N17 group as much as M17.]
;W[md];B[le];W[me];B[lf];W[kf]
(;B[lg]C[the extra stone was to be able to later create influence

Nice, see the variation for how to use 'light' stones by resurrecting 'dead' stones.]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[on];B[ol];W[np];B[qq]SQ[no][oo]C[I like this kidn of play because you can focus on your outside stones now - and they would love a stone at R12 right now. If Your BR corner is strong now and even though you gave him some outside influence, his wall is far from solid, you have the outside stones and the bottom left is open, and he has a cutting point at the squares.

A possible variation is given]
(;W[fq];B[jq]C[i saw that potential for white and thought i better invade

YEAH! This move is perfect. It can connect to the left by attacking his white stone, or to the right underneath. Either way white is left with at least one group that is weak.]

(;W[cn];B[eo]C[i really like this move i dont know why but i think i used it well i dont know it probably wasnt the best move but i wasnt able to think of a better one at the time

i think it's great. It works very well with your K3 stone to pressure F3, if he runs with F3, you can pressure C6 with a move at D7.]

(;W[cq]C[he's just taking a couple of points, there's much open territory on the board to take now that you have sente.]

(;B[gp]C[Nice];W[dq]C[Very weak move imo.];B[dm]C[Nice, you're pressing him very low - he gains 2 points for every move he crawls along the 3rd line - so you win more than he does.]

(;W[cp]C[more weak moves by white. see variation to compare]

(;B[do]C[why this move?];W[lq]C[There's no need to worry about life yet - your group is facing the center with lots of supporting black stones to help later.]

(;B[kp]LB[gq:A]C[this may have been a better move for territory but i thought if i could connect to those other two black stones it would create allot of influence

good thinking but it is too late. He would have to pass many times for you to build a connected group through those two knight's moves of his.]

(;W[lp]C[Exactly. With one move he removed all his cutting points, strengthened his stones and locked your corner in completely. And you kinda asked him to play this move...]
;B[lo];W[kq];B[jp];W[mo];B[ln]C[nice

your black group can make two eyes if necessary now - so stop worrying about saving it and focus on using it's influence]
;W[nm];B[ml]C[probably a bad move idk

depends on what you're trying to do. It begs a cut at O8, but you don't care as N8 is really a very versatile stone and will be very hard to kill.]
;W[nl]
(;B[nk];W[pl];B[pk];W[pm];B[ok]C[ok - this is a bit dangerous - you're asking him to play at R11]
;W[dj]LB[qp:A]C[that move scared me

i hear ya - remember "important moves before big moves".

He spent a lot of time making sure his groups are kinda OK so that he could play a big move. You can't afford to do that yet as you have important moves to make to secure your weak groups. BUT he has one weak group (R14) that you can pressure while strengthening your opwn weak groups - see variation]

Stronger opponents can use that against you.
