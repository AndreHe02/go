AB[pd][dp][pp]C[goCoder42 [14k\]: hi gg

Hey there, I'm Johnny5, a KGS 6k.  I'll go ahead with the review and then sum up at the end.]
;W[nq]LB[dc:B][cd:C][dd:A]SQ[qn]C[Okay, first off, this is not a good move for white.  When starting a game, you should be looking to play the "big" plays.  White decided to attack here, but it doesn't mean that you need to respond since there are still much much larger places to play, like D16 for example.  You took it later, but it would have been better to play there after this play.

If white insists on capturing that corner, he'll be wasting moves to secure one corner while you can play big elsewhere.]
(;B[kq]C[Here, I'd prefer a calmer response from black.  You already have the advantage of the handicap stones, so it's best to use them to their fullest potential.]

[qo][ro][pp]SQ[qj]C[This was the big play.  Other big places would be at the marked locations. 

One thing that is important to remember is that you generally want to avoid playing near thickness, like the marked stones.

Click the square to see why.]
(;W[mo]SQ[hq]C[This is quite a small threat.  black should be more concerned with the L3 stone.  It is very weak currently and the white stones at O3 are very strong, so it's easy for white to invade and push your weak stones around.]
(;B[nn];W[lo]
(;B[ko]SQ[hq]C[Again, the move you want is marked.  It does no good to try and attack strong groups of stones with weak stones.]
;W[kn];B[jo];W[jn];B[in];W[lq]
(;B[jp]TR[jo][ko]SQ[jq]C[This play doesn't make sense.  The empty triangle is never a good shape, so it's best to avoid making that shape when it's possible to make much stronger shapes instead.]
;W[lp]SQ[cj]
(;B[iq]LB[jc:D][jd:C][cj:B][dj:A]C[This play is not necessary.  Again, you want to look for big moves when you're in the opening.
In case you're wondering what happens with the cut at J5 without that stone, I've included a variation.]
;W[cp]C[The almost seems like an overplay to me on white's part.  it would be best for you to let him live in the corner and get a really powerful wall on the outside.]
(;B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[cr];W[bp]SQ[ep]C[The correct move for black is the extension at E4]

[ds:4]SQ[ch]C[Good on black for getting the big play, though remember urgent before big.  You need to give some help to the marked stones since there are in grave danger right now.  White will gain substantial territory by capturing those two stones, nearly 30 points.]

;W[lb]C[Anyway, to sum up.  When you open, you want to look for the big plays.  Be sure to practice making good shapes and avoid the empty triangle whenever possible.  Urgent moves before big moves.  Overall you didn't do so bad.  Just a few reading errors I think.  You successfully played most all of the big points in the middle game, but when had trouble with fighting.  Be sure to practice reading ahead and you'll improve greatly.]

(;B[hq]LB[jc:D][ed:E][jd:C][cj:B][dj:A]C[From here, white doesn't have any particularly good continuations with his small group in the corner.  It's obvious that the places you both want to play now would be around the marked areas.]

(;W[jc];B[qj];W[ed]C[Here you can see that black's stone played at R10 did very little to increase his potential territory, and is not necessary since the stones at R5 are already quite strong and should have no trouble living if they somehow came under threat.]
