Black: BlackCat, 4k

September 23 1994

White wins by time.

Commentary by weakknee and TS.];W[qe];B[qp];W[ec];B[cd]L[de][pp]M[dp]C[TS: Of course this can't be bad (can it?), but I would've  thought 'a' works better with the marked stone.

W: I think it is a matter of style here. If the stone at R4
is moved to `b', however, the high move at `a' is probably  preferable.]

(;W[fd]L[jc][oq][op]C[W: A strange move, too solid I think. It forces black to  settle
himself by extending in the direction of the lower stones, which
is not consistent with the aggressive 3-5 moves.

If white dislikes pincering black, he should play a wide extension
to `a' directly. White could also press down on the black stone  before extending as shown in the variation; this gives the same  sort of result as the game, but better. Another idea is to leave  the top left and play a kakari at `b' or `c'.]
;B[dg];W[jc];B[od]L[pc][mc][kp]C[W: I don't like this move. Right now, black is developing  quite rapidly, whereas all whites stones are on the upper side.
The chinese move at `c' looks good now. Should white answer at `a',
black can continue on the left side, and there are plenty of reducing
moves left for the top.   Another reason is that none of the moves in the upper right looks ideal.
I guess the choice is between the move played and `a'. If black plays as  in the game. he (should) get a fairly weak group which won't help any moyos
near the bottom. On the other hand, black `a' gives white the ideal pincer  at `b'.]

(;W[mc]M[jc]C[W: Interesting, unusual move. The standard  sequence
in the variation can't be bad though, because black can't
extend as far as he would like to because of the marked stone.];B[qd];W
[qc]L[rd]C[W: Another interesting choice. Looks a bit brutal :)
At `a' instead?];B[pd]L[rd]C[W: I honestly don't know what the correct  move here is.
The move played looks OK; extending down to `a' seems too thin.];W[rd];B
[pf]L[rc]M[qe]C[TS: ? Playing 'a' and capturing the marked  stone seems good enough.

W: Yes, cutting at `a' is definitely much better! A ponnuki on the  inside is not interesting for white, and so this looks like  a refutation of the move at R17.

The move played only helps white. It also looks a bit thin,  because of the cut it leaves.]

(;W[re]L[rf][qf][pe]C[TS: A fellow 3d said  'a' would be better. I considered it,  but disliked Black then playing 'b' or some such point and  defusing the cut at 'c', which I apparently was obsessed with.

W: I would also prefer `a'. The reason is that it has better  follow-ups than the move played; see the variation.]
;B[ck];W[fq]L[oq]C[TS: Trying  to prevent a large moyo.

W: I would prefer a kakari at `a'; the 3-3 invasion doesn't
run away in the near future ...]
(;B[eq]L[jp][hq][ip]C[W: Not so  good, as it strengthens white. I only like this move  when it overconcentrates white, i.e. if there is a stone around `a'.
My own preference here is a pincer at `b' or `c'.];W[fp];B[kq]M[eq][dp]
C[W: Overplay!  The idea of forcing white into overcrowding
is nice, but white gets too much pressure on the marked stonesr.];W[do]
L[iq][dn]M[dn]C[TS: Hm. 'a' first?

W: No, if W plays `a', then B will extend at `b' and W ends up  overconcentrated. What white did was correct.]
;B[co];W[dn];B[cn];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[cm]L[ep]C[TS: 'a' first!

W: Yes!!! a move at `a' makes all the difference here,  leaving black with an unpleasant result (too little area for the  white thickness, given that there was a black stone in the corner  when white started).]
;B[ap]L[bo]C[W: Better at `a' (see sequence)]
(;W[bm];B[bo];W[dl]L[el][eo][em][dm]C[TS: It was suggested to me that 'a'  is better, but then 'b' is troublesome. Now, however,
Black 'c', White 'd', Black 'b' is just as nasty.
White clearly bungled this corner.

W: I think the solid connection is best (least aji).]
(;B[dj]C[TS: Gives me  a break, but...

W: Black is playing gentleman. I would cut immediately.];W[iq]L[gm]C
[TS: ... White  decides pigheadedly that he's not going  to lose momentum. He'd rather lose, period. :-/

W: The cut certainly looks worrysome. A protective move
around `a' might well be preferable ...];B[ko]M[ko]L[eo]C[W: I think  black again should cut here directly at `a'!  The marked move is huge, but chasing two weak dragons  and maybe even catching one looks even bigger :)]
;W[io]L[fn][gm]C[W: Protecting the cut directly is more important.
I would play `a' or `b'. The move white played doesn't
actually do all that much.];B[fj]M[fj]C[W: Black should still cut! White would be  in  really sick shape. Moreover, the marked move does  relatively little for black (except forcing white to
protect himself).];W[fl]C[... which he promptly does :)];B[mf]M[pf][pd]
[od][qd]L[pk]C[W:  Blacks stones don't work together too well now.
One excuse for the previous black move would be to give  indirect help to the marked group in case of a cut.
So, I would prefer a move on the right side, at `a' for example.

W is a bit behind, but the game is certainly still playable.];W[op]C[W: Deep sea diving:) A nice invasion I  think.]

(;B[pq]C[Hmm I think playing outside looks more interesting,  as in the variation.]
;W[mq]L[on]C[This may threaten a connection, but  I think white would do better to jump to `a'.
This keeps the threat of disconnecting black  open, and prevents a weak heavy group from  appearing.]

(;B[jp]
(;W[ip]M[mq]C[If white is going to answer here, he  shouldn't
have played the marked stone in the first place.
The two stones get into too much trouble. Ignoring black dosn't
look disasterous (variation) ...];B[pn]C[Now things get hairy ...];W[mn]
;B[km];W[jn]C[No, this peep is definitely from the wrong side.
Always play from the weaker group, unless you intend  to sacrifice it.]
;B[lo];W[on];B[om]C[Ojoj, overplay, just extend to `a' and  let white
struggle on. This move leaves too many cutting points ...];W[nm];B[lm];W
[pm]L[po]C[... which white promptly exploits. However, I would
leave out the atari and play immediately at `a'. Later,
you would probably prefer an atari from the other side.];B[ol];W[po];B[qn]
;W[qo];B[rn];W[ro]C[Very good result for white!!! Nice sequence.];B[rp]

(;W[sn]L[ql][sp][so]C[TS: Now that I look at it, 'b' looks better. It  would seem either the corner dies or White
gets out with the sequence shown in variation B.

W: Generally, the golden rule is to extend straight down (to `c')
because that dos't give black any forcing moves from either side.
However, here `b' really looks better. Which just shows that not
all that sparkles is a golden rule :) Or maybe I am missing something here  ...]
;B[ql];W[oq]L[or][sp]C[An all-out attempt to kill black would start at `a',
but because black has `b' in sente, there is very little
chance of success here. So I think whites move is correct.];B[or];W[qr]
L[nr]C[Does not kill! better at `a' immediately!];B[pr];W[nr];B[rr];W
[mk]L[nl]C[TS: Blunder. 'a' is correct.];B[nl];W[mm];B[ml];W[mo];B[lk]
L[qg]C[Not neccessary! A move at `a' looks big now.];W[qh]C[Good move.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[qj];B[pj]C[
 eek 5k*: this game still looks balanced

W: Not really. Black is a good bit ahead. A little bit
more territory and also more opportunities for expansion.];W[kf];B[ld]C
[
 olli 1d*: well, tero's bungled bottom left]
(;W[kc]L[kd]C[TS: This is probably  unreasonable, White should settle for 'a'.

W: true, it is risky, but white is behind and needs to find a way to catch up.
So a complicated fight seems about right. white `a' gives away too much safe  territory for black (see the variation).

 olli 1d*: to me seems b a bit ahead];B[kd];W[jd];B[je]C[
 eek 5k*: yes, he's thicker];W[ke]C[
 olli 1d*: thicker and got more potential];B[jf]C[

 olli 1d*: b in trouble now?
 olli 1d*: hm, looks like
 eek 5k*: are k15 stones so important?];B[hf]C[
 olli 1d*: well, b's idea of a moyo has now been frustrated];W[kh];B[lc]
L[hg][lg]M[kh]C[TS: This seems foolish, it just reduces Black's  liberties.

W: agreed

 eek 5k*: yes
 olli 1d*: l12 seems too loose

W: hmm, I quite like l12 (the marked move). It aims stronger
outwards than a solid connection, and works well with moves such as `a'.
The only annoying thing is the peep at `b'];W[lb]L[md]C[eek 5k*: n16 then attack  middle w group?

TS: One problem: White would ignore 'a'.];B[hk]C[TS: Still, this is  a blunder.]
;W[me]C[TS: This evens things somewhat, although Black still seems to  have more potential to me.

W: It all depends how strongly black can attack the bottom left  white group (not very strongly I think). Over the rest of the board,
things are pretty much even again, so white is back in the game.];B[md]
C[TS:  A follow-up blunder.

W: Oje. ascii board or byoyomi?];W[nd]C[
 olli 1d*: b blunder
 eek 5k*: sure did];B[gn];W[fn];B[db];W[eb];B[hd]C[TS: This threatens nothing, so  it just loses momentum.]

[hf][hd]C[This ko looks a bit risky, as white is doing  better now,
and black has a lot of ko threats..  When lost, it can become quite a burden for white. I guess  I would simply connect solidly at `a' in sente, aiming to  attack the marked stones afterwards.]
;B[de];W[cc];B[ne];W[le];B[cd];W[kn];B[ln];W[cc];B[mp];W[cd]L[no]M[mo]
[mn][mm][nm]C[TS: A miscalculation - I didn't realize 'a' captures the  marked stones. However...

W: Yes, that was the problem with your previous ko-threat.];B[no]L[fg]
[rm]M[hf][hd][jf][je][fj][dj][ck][dg][de]C[ copernicus 6k*: what is w  doing ?
 olli 1d*: netlagging, I think
 olli 1d*: oops :-) blundering, I mean
 copernicus 6k*: resign time

TS: Wrong. For one thing, all the marked stones are somewhat vulnerable.  Secondly, although I
didn't realize it at the time, White can live or escape with 'b' - see the  variation for some
outcomes.
The upshot of all this is that o5 is not a threat, and probably is a losing  move.

W: I agree. The sequence in the variation is nice. Also, even if white lost  that entire group (13 stones), that makes about 40 points in total. The ko  fight
in the corner alone was worth more than 30. It is your move, so if you make a  splitting attack at `c' (better than `a'), you should actually capture one
of the marked groups. That gives you more territory. The sequence in the  variation  is an additional bonus.]

(;W[fg]L[gg]C[As said before, I think `a' is better.];B[ff];W[ef]L[hh]
C[ copernicus 6k*: as long as b's top and left  hangs vaguely together, he cant loose, i guess

TS: As explained, not true. As to hanging together, 'a' seems better.

W: better for black than his next move, I take it? Yes.];B[fe];W[ee]C[
 olli 1d*: seems like a think hope now];B[eg];W[gg];B[df];W[ed];B[hg];W
[gi]L[fi][hh]C[ copernicus 6k*: i guess b f11 does the trick
 copernicus 6k*: no doesnt

TS: Right, 'a' doesn't work; White plays 'b' and captures the Black stones.  Which, when combined with the capure of the upper left corner, would negate  the loss of the lower right - assuming it was a loss, that is.

 eek 5k*: h12 looks vital
 copernicus 6k*: yes
 copernicus 6k*: then w f11 and then ????
