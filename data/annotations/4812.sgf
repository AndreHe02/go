C[[[Hello - my name's Adam, and I'm submitting this game for review because, even though I won, it is all too typical of my recent wins.  I've been repeating the same pattern over and over: I fall behind, I frequently find myself with no idea what my next move should be, and eventually I am reduced to picking hopeless fights.  Fortunately, I'm not too bad at close fighting, and have somehow been winning the hopeless fights.  But I imagine that this will change when I start facing even stronger opponents, and I'd rather not get into that situation in the first place.\]\]

[[I'm interested in any comments you'd care to make, but I've marked a few of the moves that follow as spots where I was in particular need of direction.  I'll be using double brackets to separate my questions from your answers.  When this game started, I was 7k, my opponent was 8k, and I played White with a komi of 0.5.  Thanks for your help!\]\]


Hello, my name is Christian Reiling and will review this game
for you. I hope you will find my comments useful.];B[cp];W[pp]

;B[cn];W[jp];B[qn];W[mq];B[pj];W[dj]LB[cc:A]C[[[Up to this point I was pretty satisfied with how things were going.  (Should I have been?)\]\]


CR: Hmmm. I cannot find any real mistake until here, but
I would say black is better here.
Black has corner territory in the bottom left and a strong moyo
around the right upper corner. White has something on the bottom and the three stones on the upper left, but it's black's turn and black should invade at A in sente now.

Therefore I would feel better as black now.]
(;B[fd]LB[cc:A]C[[[This move stumped me.  I thought that if I made a joseki reply on the left side, my K16 stone would come under severe attack, but if I tried to save K16, my D16 would become just as vulnerable a target.  I could really use some direction here.  What should I be looking at?  What should my priorities be?  What are the best moves here?\]\]


CR: This move is surely playable, but I would have invaded at A here. Look at my variation.]
;W[jj]LB[df:A]C[[[I made this response thinking that it might help tie all my stones into one big framework that would support itself... I thought that if D16 got cut off and had to make its own life in the corner, then K16 and D10 would have to run to the center, and playing tengen would give them a target to run towards.  Even with that justification, though, I felt like I was playing a stupid move.  I just couldn't think of a better one.\]\]

CR: You should play A instead.];B[cf];W[ce];B[jf]C[CR: Very aggressive.]
;W[ke]C[[[I thought the game would be hopeless if I didn't save K16, so I tried to save it...\]\]]
;B[kf];W[le];B[md];W[df]C[[[I thought the K16 group now had enough chance at life that I could defuse the threat of C14...\]\]]
;B[ff];W[dg];B[hc]C[[[And suddenly saving K16 looked nowhere near as likely as I had thought moments earlier.\]\]]
;W[lf]C[[[I thought I could run this way...\]\]];B[lg]C[[[...but evidently not.\]\]]
;W[ne]LB[mg:A]C[CR: I think the hane at A would make better shape.]
;B[ng];W[qf]C[[[At this point I gave up on K16 and figured I'd use the threat of linking up with K16 to make life on the side.\]\]

;W[bj];B[lk];W[qo]C[[[I played this thinking that if Black played R3 I would have no chance whatsoever.  Of course, it later occurred to me that it doesn't prevent Black from playing R3 later!\]\]]
;B[pn]C[[[But even though I knew this would be the response, it suddenly looked almost as bad as R3!  At this point I felt like I was hopelessly behind.  To my eyes, Black appeared to have a stranglehold on most of the top 1/3 of the board, a chunk of the right side, and the bottom left corner.  I was likely to end up with the top left corner and a thin strip along the bottom.  I see that Cgoban imagines that I have some claim on the bottom left center, but I figured that would all become dame.  I thought I had no chance if I couldn't rescue my K16 stones.  Finally, some direction - but much too late, since K16 looked irretrievable.\]\]]

;W[nd];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[me]C[[[So, I hit upon a combination to rescue the K16 stones.  This is the sort of thing I have to do in EVERY GAME!  And while these escapes are nice in retrospect, I'd rather not be so far behind to begin with.\]\]


CR: But, if you are successful by doing this, ... :)];B[jm]
C[[[So, 19 was the first "What on earth do I do?" move I'm hoping for help with; here's the second.  So many options, but which is best?  I was looking at F12, E8, H10, L8, O5, S18, and several other possibilities, but I don't know how to prioritize, or even if those are the right points to be considering.\]\]]
;W[no]LB[kl:A]C[[[I eventually decided that this was the best dual-purpose move, but it was a pretty arbitrary selection.\]\]


CR: I would have probably played A - either for separation, or for spoiling blacks influence on the right.]

;W[rn]C[[[This move was based on a misreading - I thought that B S7, W T5 would be sente for me because of the threat of the clamp at S8, but then I saw to my horror that that clamp doesn't work.\]\]]
;B[rm];W[so];B[gm]C[[[This move was pretty demoralizing.  Is this where I should have played at 140 instead of S6?  I had considered it!  I just thought S6 was sente!\]\]]
;W[gl];B[hl];W[fl];B[gn]C[[[This move was unexpectedly passive, so at this juncture I went into full-on endgame mode.  In the past my endgames have been absolutely terrible, but this one went okay, so maybe I've learned something.  Still, let me know if any of these endgame moves are bad.\]\]]
