;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[co];B[pp]C[Again, I'm playing with black.

This is my first 19x19 game and my first serious  game.

Any comment is welcome and appreciated.

Hi Florin, my name is Martin, let us see:];W[jq];B[pj];W[nc]
;B[lc];W[qf]
(;B[qd]C[I don't know for sure but I don't trust this move...

It´s not the best move. Now you must make a decision:  corner or the outside wall?]
;W[ne];B[le];W[of];B[oc];W[nb]
(;B[ob];W[md];B[ld];W[re];B[rd];W[rb]
(;B[rc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qc];B[qa];W[oa]
(;B[mb]C[????? If you shouldn´t make this move, the  situation on the board is the same. Any another  move is much more better...]
;AE[mb];W[na];B[pa];W[mc];B[lb];W[od];B[pc];W[sd];B[sb];W[pe]
;B[ra]C[Yeah, you are alive, but the W is much more  stonger (see the situation on the move 29)
now, alive and you have no territory yet.];W[qn]
(;B[qo]C[Very bad move!!!];W[pn]
(;B[np];W[nj]
(;B[me]C[???? You must safe your stone or make some  territory, but this is nothing!!!!!!]
;W[nn]
(;B[nh]TR[pj]C[Again I have the feeling something is wrong with  this  move...

It has no relations to the marked stone on the Star.];W[oi]
;B[oh];W[ph];B[pi];W[qh];B[nf];W[oe];B[og];W[pf]
(;B[qi]LB[ol:A]C[This is very very bad shape. You can still run out  with your stones. If W plays A, it would be very  difficult.]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[pg];B[rg];W[si];B[sj];W[sh];B[rj];W[ni];B[mh]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[pl]C[The entire sequence is doubtful...];B[ok]
;W[nk];B[rl];W[ql];B[ol];W[nl];B[rk];W[rm];B[ma]C[It is nonsence to loose ko threat now. Anyway W  could answer.]
;W[om];B[nd];W[qj];B[ro];W[sl]
(;B[rn]C[This move is not big. Your stones are captured  anyway.]
;W[hd]
(;B[hf]C[At that time I haven't seen a better move... not even  now...

Anythig is better...];W[ec];B[dc];W[ed];B[ee];W[eb];B[db];W[jc]

(;B[ic]C[To me it seems a useless move now; however I  don't see any other...

You help to make your opponent stronger.];W[id];B[if];W[fe]
;B[ef];W[ff];B[fg]LB[dj:B][lq:C][cl:A]C[It is not a good idea, you still have big points on the  board.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[eh]
(;B[gg];W[dh];B[df];W[ch];B[cg];W[dl]C[And a huge white territory shows up. At this point I  got confused: what had been the main reason  (mistakes) for this?


See move 105 - varint - YOU WAS TOO MUCH  AFFRAID TO SAVE ALL YOUR STONES.]
;B[gq]C[??? A hectic answer... What could have been a  better move here?

I think it is a good one, but the question is: why did  not you continue???]
;W[hp]
(;B[kq];W[kp]
(;B[lp];W[ko]
(;B[lo];W[lq];B[mq]C[This sequence has a bad omen but I don't know why...]
;W[kr];B[ln];W[jm];B[hl]C[You was very kindfull to your opponent, you asked  him to build a big territory.]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[hn];B[jl];W[ib];B[fb];W[da]

(;W[hc];B[fd];W[gd];B[fc];W[gb];B[ea];W[ha];B[ga];W[fa];B[eb]
;W[ga];B[jd];W[jb]
(;B[jn]C[Finally, white survives on the upper border and I  make a new strange move. I had the feeling I have  to play on the bottom. But I didn't have a clue  where... and now I don't either.

This is not a big move.];W[in];B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[ll]
;W[kk]C[Any idea?];B[ki];W[jk];B[hj];W[il];B[hk];W[ji];B[jh]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[ih];B[jg];W[hg]

;B[bf];W[bj];B[cj];W[ck];B[el];W[em];B[fj];W[dk];B[ej];W[fm]
;B[gk];W[ns]LB[mr:A]C[And now comes the biggest mistake I committed: I  ignore the the attack.

Monkey jump, that is why point A is so big. And  your answer was bad too.]
;B[im];W[lk];B[mk];W[mj];B[ml];W[kj]
(;B[mr];W[ms];B[lr];W[ls];B[kq];W[jp];B[jr];W[lq]
(;B[ik]C[I had b12 (too tired to remember it) but I don't know  if this would have meant anything...


??? I don´t understand, but anyway this move is a  very little one.]
;W[kq];B[ig]C[??? Still you have time to safe corner!!! You got 11  points, but lost everything in the corner!!! Bad  exchange!!!]
;W[qr];B[jj];W[qq]C[I had the idea that I can survive in the corner and  that I get more points by attacking the white pieces  from center.

MISTAKE!!!];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[no];B[mp];W[or];B[oq];W[oo]
;B[pr];W[ps];B[rp];W[rq];B[sm];W[qm]C[All this seems to me a hopeless attempt to make the impossible.]
;B[sq];W[sr];B[rs];W[qs];B[nr];W[os];B[op];W[sp];B[sk];W[oj]
C[And here I resigned.

I thank you for any comments you might have.


THE MAIN PROBLEMS:
You are too much afraid to fight and you don´t want  to sacrifice any stones. You cannot safe all your  stones and make big territory!!! And I thing  sometimes you wish that your opponent would  make mistakes!!! ("I hope he wouldn´ t see it!!!") It is  much worse: Opponents see everything. Do not  think that you can win with your opponents  mistakes. You must win, because you are better  then your opponent!!!

Bye.
