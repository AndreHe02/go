C[Hello, I'm Erin (14k on KGS). In this game i played for black and lost by 12.5 pts. All my groups was alive, but territory wasn't enough to win. I would be grateful to reviewer for stressing my bad moves and  lost opportunities.  Thanks in advance!
(PS: sorry for my bad english).

Hi Erin, your style is not bad at all for a 14k. You will improve very fast (maybe while I'm writing this you are already 9k).

The only problem I see is lack of strategy, but your tactics are quite good. With experience and maybe some reading, you will improve your shape, which is not the best and gets you in trouble sometimes, but I don't see any big mistake.

Let me give you some tips.];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd]C[This is my favourite opening, two komokus. ^___^]
;W[dp]
(;B[cn]LB[qn:A]C[This one is not bad. It gets outside the meaning of a 2-komoku opening, but it's possible and flexible.

I would recommend to play at A though. The theory says that if you play in third line, the next time that you play on that side, it should be on fourth line. The reason being that if you play like here 3rd and 3rd, it gets a bit "flat" and you are losing potential points. If on the other hand, you play 4th and 4th, your opponent will invade in between, and you'll have a fight and things will get complicated.

The harmony is on combining 3rd with 4th line.];W[cl];B[cq]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[dn];B[dq];W[eq];B[bn];W[ed]C[White finally attacks the komoku and selects the best one of the two.]
;B[ec]LB[gc:A]TR[pc]C[I prefer the pincer in A, but this joseki is not too bad, because White won't get comfortable when finishing the joseki with the extension, because of the marked stone.]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cg];W[jd]TR[ed][fd][cl][dn][dp][pp][eq]
C[See?

It's too short, too compact. But we should be careful, as white is getting a lot of external influence (marked stones) and that will be very powerful on the second half of the game.]
;B[lc];W[kc]
(;B[lb]SQ[kc][jd][ld]C[This is a mistake, as there is a proverb that says "you should never allow your opponent to form a dragon's mouth (marked with squares)".

I can't remember very well if it's called dragon's mouth or not, but the shape is that one. That shape is very powerful and one should always try to make it for oneself and avoid the rival to make it himself.

See variation.]
(;W[kb];B[qf];W[ld];B[md];W[mc]
(;B[mb]C[This is a mistake.

Here the best thing to do is to sacrifice those 2 stones, if not this can happen (see variation).]

(;W[me];B[nd];W[ne];B[od];W[le];B[pj]LB[jp:A]C[Erin:
Maybe seeding down side (H3, K3 or O3) was bigger?

***************************************************************

Yes, O3 was better here. You already played on the right side at R14, but not on the bottom.
If you don't play at O3 now, white will play at A and it will be now very difficult to enter comfortably on the bottom.]
;W[jq]C[White played there. Too low, as she already has E3 on third line. K4 was the best move.]
;B[qm];W[ci];B[mq]LB[qq:A]TR[kb][fc][kc][ed][fd][jd][ld][le]
[me][ne][ci][cl][dn][dp][eq][jq]C[This was the biggest mistake you made in the game.

Now it is too late for this move.
If you wanted to get more points, you should have just entered in san-san at A instead.

Having white the stone at K3, playing here is getting into trouble. 
Just take a look at all the marked stones that were waiting for you to make that mistake.

White will try to push you against that wall and even if you live, you will make 2 or 3 points with that group, while white will be making 10 points per stone you add to that weak group.

The idea here is to enter at A and after getting the corner, jump in to the center from the right side and try to reduce white's territory in the center to the minimum. Remember that White didn't get any point, while you were making yours in the corners and side, so you have the advantage. You don't need to create more points, just destroy white's potential to get it.

On the other hand, it will be impossible for white to not get any point, so don't be greedy and complicate things too much, or white will use her power to kill one of your groups.]

(;W[nq]LB[oo:A]C[This was a mistake from white.

When you are attacking, try to NOT touch the enemy stone. The opposite is also true, if you are defending, it's always a good idea to touch and sacrifice some stone to get a living shape (this technique is called sabaki).

White felt that she was DEFENDING, but in reality she was ATTACKING, because there are more white stones than black.

DIVIDING is always a good attacking technique, so I would play in A, separating the stone at N3 from the rest, and then attacking it or enclosing that group and take the outside.

See variation.];B[np];W[oq];B[po];W[qo];B[pn]LB[mp:A]C[Erin:
Is it right? Maybe P5 or even N4?

************************************************
Yes, I think this one is not too bad, but it still has the weak point at A.

The very important thing here is to go to the center as soon as possible. But it's still ok, as white has not used her influence very efficiently and black has 2 big entry points to the center (left and mainly right sides).

Like this, Black still wins and by far (don't trust the Score Estimator, it's crazy most of the times).]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lp]
(;B[no]C[Defending here is not important, the important thing is to maintain White flat.

See variation.];W[lo];B[fg]C[Good one!

In the precise spot.];W[lm];B[mk]LB[fg:B][lj:A]C[Too shy.

A is better, because is deeper and you still can connect with B.]
;W[lk];B[lj]C[Erin:
 I think it's a bad move? Was something like N13 or F10 better?

*********************************************************************

This is why I said that playing M10 directly was better. 
At this point, this is only move, so it's a good one. It's not wrong.]
;W[kk];B[fj]LB[mi:B][mj:A]C[Very bad.

When White plays L9 (standard move), you should always defend the cutting point A at B (sometimes connecting directly at A is also good).]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[mi];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji];W[kj];B[lh];W[li];B[ig]
C[Nice sequence. You got style.];W[fl]
(;B[hl];W[hk];B[ik];W[hj];B[gl];W[fk];B[ij];W[fi];B[gj];W[gk]
;B[gi];W[ej];B[fh];W[ei];B[hi];W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[im];W[jl]
;B[il];W[qh]C[This one is SO big.

Sometimes is good to stop playing and think: WHERE ARE MY POINTS? WHERE ARE MY OPPONENT'S POINTS?

If your points are on the right side, you should, maybe, play an "extra" move to consolidate your territory. R12 must have hurt you when White played it.

I think that if you had played there instead of white, and reducing a bit more down, you win hands down.

Good luck with your improvement!!!
