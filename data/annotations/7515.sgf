C[Dear reviewer. I am Lovro Furjanic, a Croatian 9k and IGS 8k+. This was played on 29.10. on IGS Pandanet. Main time was 30 minutes and a byoyomi of 30 minutes for 25 moves. Please review both sides as my opponent is my friend so I will share this review with him.

Regards.


* Hi, my name is Litost, I play on KGS as 1k and I'll be your reviewer. I will be prefixing all my comments with a star ("*").

*This was an enjoyable game, with a great fight in the middle game. Feel free to contact me directly if you have any question regarding this review.

* About Black: a good reading, but a few passive moves, a few heavy moves, and you ended in a difficult situation (which turned out great!). Try to be more dynamic, more flexible.

* About White: a good style.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]
C[Always this fuseki with black.

* I like it as well, as it may lead to great fights.];W[po]
LB[qj:A]C[* White does not want to let black make two shimaris; this is a good move. Playing around R10 is also possible.]
;B[pl]C[* Black tries to attack white while taking advantage of the shimari. Another good move.]

(;W[qq]LB[no:A][mp:C][np:B][oq:D]C[* I think that the inner attachment is uncommon: white does end settled, but with no good extension to follow up. A to D are standard, but I cannot really tell which is best. I would probably attach to D (see variation).]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[hes stronger I dont want to take chances. also, R7 is in gote

* This is a good answer. Black's shape is strong, and White's shape appears a bit heavy, as Q8 prevents good extension.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[np]C[he has defect now

* White cannot invade the moyo immediately, because doing so would direct Black to the center, damaging on of the White group. As a result, white tries to give his group a better shape, grab some influence and also theatens to enclose Black in the corner. This is a good move.]

(;B[rq]C[I am sure to have two eyes now, altough in gote

* Losing sente in the opening is painful; this move is probably too slow, as it does not really theatens white's base, nor gives your group access to the center. 

* Why not simply extend at N3? This maps territory, and prevents white from enclosing the black group.]
;W[rp];B[rr];W[jd]C[* White takes sente and play a very good move! This offsets Black's influence, can support an invasion on the right side, and starts building the top.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[ci]C[* White presses black's group. This works well with the hoshi - good move.]

(;B[ph]C[I tought this was the biggest spot. is there anything bigger?

* This is big indeed, but I would rather concentrate on the top left. White is building something, and has 3 stones there - Black has none. I would probably reinforce the left group by attaching to D11, reducing the influence, then invade the corner right away (see variation).]

(;W[mc]C[* This move creates some good aji on the corner, but I feel going for the top left is bigger. White not threaten black's group on the left, then close the corner? (see variation)]
;B[cf]
(;W[ei]LB[cd:A]C[* Enclosing the corner immediately is also possible.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bg];W[gc];B[db]LB[eg:A]
[mq:B]C[Mistake, too small

* I agree; even the C18 descent would look small. Piercing through A (E13) looks severe. B (N3) is interesting as well (though maybe a bit slow), as it appears to safely reduce white as well, while not leaving attacking opportunity on the C9 group.]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[bq]
(;B[co]LB[bi:A]C[* This is a bit passive. I think that Black should answer more dynamically, for instance with B11 (see variation).]
;W[dm]LB[eo:A]C[* An interesting kikashi. As black shape does not look too good, and as getting enclosed would be unbearable, I would go for another stronger response (see variation).]

(;B[cm];W[dl];B[kq]C[* Awww. Now this is getting dangerous for Black! The left group is not alive yet, and White can have some attack on it. While it is not very clear how White can profit for it, we can say that Black has lost the initiative.]
;W[bl]C[* Good move, depriving Black from his base.];B[cl];W[bk]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[cj];W[aj];B[ak]C[* When under attack, it is better to save as many forcing moves as possible, as well as liberties. A move like this does not really help the group.]
;W[ai];B[bm];W[al];B[am];W[ak];B[di]C[* Good move, creates cutting points and weakens White's shape.]
;W[dh];B[dj];W[cg]LB[ch:A]C[* I would prefer a solid connection (less weaknesses), but there are so many variations I cannot be sure.]
;B[bf];W[ej]
(;B[ek]LB[df:A]C[* This move is indeed important, but I wonder if, before that, playing D14 cannot somehow damage white's shape even more.]
;W[df]C[* White fixes his shape, building the moyo. Though the move is gote, it is necessary (lots of bad aji).]
;B[fk]
(;W[gj]C[* This move let white live freely, ending the attack abruptly.

* White had such a strong attack, which could help him secure some territory in the center. Saving the D7 stones was therefore very important - and was even sente since it forced Black to defend the cut at D9.]
;B[en]C[I think the result is a little bit better for me than for him.

*  Securing your group is big indeed. If we check the situation, I think White still leads by komi; he has sente, but his group on the right isn't that healthy. Black has no weak group. Everything may now happen !]
;W[iq];B[mq];W[ne]C[* White plays at the junction of two moyos. This is a big move.]

(;B[pf]LB[nh:A]C[* This looks a bit too passive. Jumping to O12 looks more dynamic, though leads to complicated variations.]
;W[pj]C[* White wants a fight, so that he can secure an outer wall. This is a good strategy, though I do not really know what is the best way to do it.]
;B[qj];W[oj]C[* This feels heavy! What if Black now jump to O12?]

(;B[pi]C[* This is too passive (see variation).];W[nh];B[kh]
TR[hj][ij][jj][kj][lj][mj][nj]C[I had to reduce, otherwise I would lose for sure.

* Yes, but here you do more than reduce - you invade. To reduce, you would have to play on the moyo boundary.

* Invading is the right decision here, though. White has weaknesses on the right, which you can exploit to build a path out. Still, playing more actively in past moves would paradoxically have been more secure.]
;W[kj]C[* The cap looks natural.];B[mi]
(;W[ni]
(;B[lj]C[* This shape looks a bit strange. Why not tobi at N9?]
;W[ki];B[li]C[I also tought about M12

* 4 stones, one empty triangle - that's quite the heavy shape you got there!]
;W[jh];B[mg];W[ng];B[kg];W[jg];B[mf];W[nf];B[ke];W[kf]
(;B[lg]C[* This is a bit heavy. Are you trying to build half an eye in a gote move? :)

* White's shape has defects which you may exploit (see variation).]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[nl];B[ll];W[kk];B[ml];W[ol];B[pm];W[nn];B[qn]
C[I tought a lot about this move. I counted, and was behid a few points on territory. This would grant me victory if I managed to get life for my central group.]
;W[lo];B[km];W[jn];B[jm]C[This was also hard to decide.];W[in]
;B[im];W[hn];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[gm];B[hj];W[ik];B[hk];W[fl]
;B[dk];W[gi]C[Now I have one eye  in B6, and have to fight for another one. E6 cannot make an eye, and I can try connecting with my lower right group or my upper right or making an eye around L15. I decided to try my luck on the upper part of the board since I have a lot of adji for attacking in lower right.]
;B[jf];W[je];B[if]C[This ruins his territory. Now my victory is certain if my group gets life.]
;W[hh];B[kd];W[jc];B[md];W[nd];B[nc];W[nj]C[* Excellent move by White!]

(;B[lc]LB[lc:A][lk:B]C[I must do this instead of connecting. If I connect, I cant do a thing in upper part.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[mj]
(;B[me]C[A mistake

* I'm not so sure. Unless I'm missing something, I think that not protecting the shape can lead to disaster (see variation).]
;W[gf]LB[hg:A][ln:B]C[He had to play this otherwise he is risking his entire middle.

* Actually, I do not really like this move. It does help protect a bit the shape, but feels a bit loose. If white can kill the big dragon, then the game is definitely over. A or B look more interesting.

* Now, Black to play and live. High level tsumego :)];B[ij]
;W[jj];B[il];W[jk];B[ii];W[ji];B[dn];W[el];B[mn]C[The moves before I used just to test his reactions and to have a better position if I get out alive. Also, D6 makes my group harder to kill.

* This is indeed getting difficult for White. All the variations I read do not look too good.]
