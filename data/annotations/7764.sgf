C[Hi, In this game I played White.  It's somewhat of a close game.  But in the end I lost by 7.5 with komi.  The problem is, I am not quite sure what mistakes I made.  But there are a few parts where I was not sure what to do.  Please comment on my mistakes, point out better moves, and how to punish my opponent for playing bad moves.

Thank you in advance.

Hagios: This was an interesting game where your opponent overplayed a lot, but you responded mostly passively towards him.  I'll try to point out some of the main mistakes and areas you could best work on.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dd];W[cp]C[Ok I am not used to playing games that starts with cross corner openings like this.  Not sure if its coincidence, but i lose most of them.  Is there any tips or anything i should pay special attention to when this happens?

H: Of course if you hate this sort of opening, you will lose it more often.  You have two options here: Play more of this tasuki fuseki (cross fuseki) so you can get better at it, or avoid it by playing a parallel fuseki such as nirensei or sanrensei.

Remember, both players must agree to play this sort of opening for it to occur.  If you don't want it, you have to choose to avoid it.]
;B[dp]C[this move, I am not quite sure how to repspond to this.  I definitely want to keep the corner if possible, but at the same time I don't want to be closed in.  I have been taught an approach as close as this is not good, but i am not sure how to counter it.

H: This move, I'm also not certain how to respond.  A rule of thumb is, if your opponent plays tsuke, you have two choices: nobi or hane.  We can explore all of these possibilities simply.]
(;W[cq]C[H: As we saw, the hane variations had a better chance to end favorably for W.  These nobi variations are less forceful, in general.]
;B[dn]C[H: This threatens to damage W's shape at c5.  It would be wise to play c5, to prevent a bulge by B (see variations)]
(;W[dq]LB[co:A]C[H: This helps B create a thick shape facing the center, and helps strengthen the ability to play his bulge shape at A later.]
;B[ep]

(;B[qd];W[qc];B[pe];W[od];B[re]LB[rc:B][rd:A]C[H: Here, we have to consider A and B as possible moves.]

;B[rc];W[qb];B[jc]
(;W[lc]LB[ic:3][jc:2][lc:1]C[What do you think about this move?

H: I don't like this move.  Let's consider a tewari, with my new move numbers.

After W 1, B plays 2, a checking extension.  You surely wouldn't play 3!  By playing m17, you turned his strange move at k17 into a good one, and you turned your good move at j17 into a strange one!]

;W[gb];B[hb]
(;W[ga];B[ge]LB[ha:A]C[H: Now B is safe, and A is always his sente.  W has 2 small corners, and a weak group at c15.  B is favorable in this game.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn]C[H: The AB exchange is good for W, forcing W to make a good shape (extend 3 spaces from a wall of 2 stones)]
;B[rp]C[H: I guess this is a shape that B prefers in his games.  This aims at s6.]

H: 19 points is a big corner, but it's not a game.  There were a lot of areas to improve the game earlier, so this single problem can't be called the losing point.]

H: This game wasn't lost in the endgame.  B ended this game ahead on the board by 14 points.  If you would like to improve your endgame, look into the book Get Strong at the Endgame by Richard Bozulich, published by Kiseido.  In the meantime, the following things you might want to work on, are as follows:

1) Attacking spirit!  If your opponent does something weird (like move 5) then you need to be willing to fight over the validity of the move.  As the game was, you allowed him to make your position worse than his after a strange move.  If that was a normal sequence, then the 3,4 point would be ignored by amateurs and pros alike.

2) Positional judgement.  You should consider each structure's strengths and weaknesses, as well as how it is working with other stones.  s17 is a good example of letting your opponent get a good move that should have been yours.

3) Direction of play and consistency.  You almost could have killed the e4 group, which would have kept you in the game.  At the last minute, you changed your mind and jumped into your opponents (comparatively smaller) territory.  This kind of inconsistency will destroy your game.

I hope this has been helpful to you.  If you have any other questions, please feel free to ask me.]

As an aside, since both hanes are gote, we normally consider the result as W at g19, B at h19 when considering the endgame.  There is a wonderful video by Catalin Taranu on this subject at the following address: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6fFqhod8L0]
