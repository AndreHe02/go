C[In this match I felt behind my opponent for the whole time, but in the end he won just by a small margin. I wonder when he took the lead...

I haven't played for a while, so I've probably become weaker and my rank on online servers is messed up. I'd really appreciate if you could give me an advice about my current rank, to help set the correct handicap, find the right opponentes, etc.

Thanks!];B[pp]C[N3cro: hi

it's unnecessary right now.You could tenuki and get more points (may be to win the game)
White stones are dead already..Tenuki is the best answer :)]

Post game: i am not the one to tell you about rank but just don't care rank too much.Also i can say that you lost game with the "misread ladder" or KO at yose.You play too solid but a little slow.And seems like you are too afraid from getting cut.Sometimes you placed unnecessary stones to your own area and they reduced your score one by one..
Just try reading a few moves far..
Hope you improve fast and much.Have nice games.With my best regards..
