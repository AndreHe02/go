C[Hi paco,

This is an exciting game, full of action.  B gained a big advantage when he won the first battle, but he failed to keep the edge when he started a running battle and then failed to keep up the pressure on W.

I've added comments and variations to most of the early moves, and also at crucial stages of fighting in the middle.  There's no endgame comments (since I'm not so good at it myself :)  There are comments on some W moves as well, where they might be of some interest.

Here're some general comments:

Opening:  have a consistent strategy.  Try to think of the whole board.  See #5, 13, 19, 21, 23.

Regarding seeing the whole board: during the game, it's also important to see beyond the immediate area of action before responding to your opponent's moves.  It might be possible to play larger moves in other areas or simply on the other side of the "natural"-seeming move.  Consider whether a move is "urgent" or not before you play it.  See #63, 65, 81, 107, 125.

Attack:  Maintain pressure on opponent's weak groups.  Attack with the objective of making profit.  Sometimes it's okay to let a group run along to safe connection or a small life, so long as you have made some profit along the way.  See #13, 73, 81, 107.

About the fight in the lower right side of the board: W gave B a great opportunity with two weak groups in LR corner, and it's great that B managed to capture one of them.  But some of B's moves were a little loose.  See#33, 35, 37, 39.

Defense:  Beware of making purely defensive moves.  Unless they are absolutely urgent (that is, if you don't make a move, your group'll die), it's better to first look for other options on the board (again, remember to play with the whole board in mind).  See 19, 76.

Lastly, take all the variations with a grain of salt.  They're only a not-so-good go player's imagination :)

This is my first time doing a review, so my advance apologies if it's in anyway confusing, needlessly redundant, or not quite helpful.  Hope all this is useful, and good luck in your games in the future!

Best,
Ken];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc]
(;B[ec]LB[fd:a][dd:b][ed:c]C[P: maybe too agressive?

K: The more usual approach to a 3-3 stone would be on the 4th line, especially given that B has started out on the two star points.  B's intention with this type of opening would seem to play more of a "power" game, with emphasis on thickness and to derive profit from attacking.

There's no point in trying to attack a 3-3 stone directly, since it's alive anyway you go about it.  The goal, then, should be to build up a thick, solid position on top of it.]

(;W[dd]LB[de:a][cf:b][ed:c]C[W6 is too "narrow".  And just imagine W4 and W6 reversed in order (i.e. W d16, B E17, W c17).  If B had somehow approached W stone on 4-4 with something like E17, would W not attach at D17 instead of ducking into 3-3?  a and b would seem more usual.  c could be interesting also (see var.)]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[fe];W[de]LB[ef:a]C[W should extend along the 5th line.  There's no need to mind the breaking pt at W10.]
;B[ff]C[P: maybe L16 is better

K: This is good.  It builds up a wall, working nicely with B1.  And it checks any potential W has on the left (see later comments here and there).]
;W[jd]
(;B[hd]LB[mc:a][lc:b]C[B should apply pressure from the other side.  a or b would serve a double purpose of attacking and making an extension.  B13 here is purely defensive.  This is not quite necessary because W12 is high, so B'd have enough space below to live.  Alternatively, since B11 is out into the center already, it wouldn't be hard to make life in the center (while possibly reducing W territory on the left).  Good rule of thumb:  drive the opponent's stones toward your thickness (where there're more stones of yours in solid formation).

see var.

BTW, for the reasons that B a/b would be good, W should've played maybe L17 instead of K16.  It'd give W more comfortable extension space on either side.]
;W[nc];B[oc]LB[pf:a][lc:b][nd:c]C[B should simply play a.  If you want to attack, splitting W at b might be considered, especially since B played B13 already.  c might be interesting, too, since W12 would in the wrong place for the joseki.  The combination of B15-17 doesn't work here because W's got W12 in place...]
;W[nd]C[...and W16 makes for a perfect shape:  a 3-space extension from two stones.]
;B[pf]C[B17 thus hands sente over to W.]
(;W[ic]LB[nf:a]C[I'm not so sure about this, but I think W doesn't really need to play this.  Jumping out to a would be more efficient:  it'd both alleviate the severity of a B throw-in at M16 or M17 and create possibilities in the corner (since B15 doesn't enclose the corner yet).

See var. for what can happen in the corner.];B[hc]LB[cn:a][fq:b]
[qj:c]C[Since B's group's got its head sticking out into the open, there's no real threat here.  And since B19 cannot put pressure on the W group, either, it only serves to give B 4 or 5 pts of territory.  That is too small at this early stage.  I'd rather play c6, f3,  or r10 now.    Perhaps there's something in B playing at L17 next, but I'm not sure.]
;W[nf]
(;B[jq]LB[cn:a][fq:b][ph:c]C[Since W20 presents no immediate threat, it is right for B to ignore it.  But instead of B21, it'd be more effective/efficient to play a or b (c could be played, too, perhaps, knowing the defect in the corner.  But it's not urgent.)

See var.];W[dh]C[Better to play on the right side, to prevent B making a double-wing formation.]
;B[dl]LB[ck:a][fq:b]C[If you want to invade a moyo, go deeper.  It'd be easier to make life on the side starting with a stone on the third line.  Also, B23 is not really reducing a moyo, since there isn't one yet.  It's probably best to approach at b, since B has played B21 already.  Anything W'd be able to build up following B F3 would be well matched by what B can build on the lower side of the board.  And it (the future W moyo) would not be hard to handle (again, given B11).]
;W[cn]C[Good move to start protecting the corner and depriving B of a base on the side.]

(;B[qj]C[P:  because 23 is alive and this way I make more territory

K:  well, B23 might not live if W is good at attacking.  Just at first glance, it'd seem rather easy to make it into a "floating group" with no eye space on the side by playing something like C9 or C10.  Then, as B runs out into the center, it is *not* inconceivable for B to be captured or to suffer heavy losses elsewhere trying to save this group.

Again, imagine reversing the order of these moves.  If B played 23 at R10, then W24, would B make a reducing move or an invasion at D8?  B25 certainly is a large move, so B should've played it first!]

(;W[nq]C[Might not be a bad idea for W to simply go into 3-3 and let B build up something along either the right or the bottom, since neither could get too large:  (1) the right side would be easy to reduce because of the corner aji, and W20 making a play at R12 quite reasonable;  (2) B's not too solid at bottom.  With the weak stone B23, W could reduce any bottom B moyo through attacking B23.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn]C[This time, B27-29 is appropriate, with B21 in place.]
;W[qm]LB[kp:a][kq:b][ql:c]C[Not a good move.  a (to get out quickly) or b (to try to get a base quickly) would seem more practical.  If W wants to invade and start a fight, c would work better.  But W shouldn't try to start a fight here.  W30 (or c) only creates two weak groups inside B's sphere of influence.]
;B[qn]SQ[pp][oq]C[P: threating to kill 30 and making territory   K: in the future, remember, Q4-P3 formation simply doesn't secure the corner yet.  So here B should think more in terms of creating a splitting attack since the corner.]
;W[pm];B[oj]LB[on:a][nn:b]C[P: the  same idea

K: too far to be threatening W30-32 group, and too open yet on top to make solid territory.

B33 thus actually feels like a defensive move.  But at this point, pushing out at a would be a better offensive option. (b might also work; it's perhaps better shape anyway.)  a would split the two W groups for good (and ensures B can get out into the open in case something goes wrong in the corner -- that's my mid-kyu thinking :)]
;W[on]C[And W grabs the good point.  But this is risky (and B proved it to be costly ultimately :)]

(;B[oo]LB[om:a]C[B could perhaps cut immediately at a.    See var.]
;W[no];B[nn]LB[om:a]C[P: separating both groups

K: a would be better, since W30-32 is easier to catch (fewer liberties).]
;W[om]
(;B[mm]LB[mn:a][nr:b]C[P: to prevent scape

K:  to prevent escape of which W group?  B39 is too ambiguous (too ambitious?).  I'd take a instead, to first aim at the lower group; then, depending on how W responds, decide which group to enclose and capture.    Also, B shouldn't worry about getting into a fight, since he's got support on both sides.  So, leave B37 and playing b instead (to secure corner) could be an option, too.]
;W[qq]C[P:  oh my god

K: yup, this kind of corner formation is still quite vulnerable :)  But you responded well.]

(;B[rn];W[op];B[po];W[pq];B[rm]C[Jumping to s8 is better.];W[qk]
LB[mn:a]C[It'd be better for W to a to threaten B21 stone.]

;W[ql];B[nm];W[ok];B[ol]C[P:  his group is dead

K: nice kill :)];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[pg]C[P: to separate 58

K: This does the job, but what was your purpose?  Did you intend to get into a running battler?  I'd think that, with W58 now so surrounded by B stones, the idea should be to capture it outright here.]
;W[oi]
(;B[nh]C[It wouldn't be a bad idea to sacrifice B59 and play 63 at Q11 instead.  B'd get the right side (if he gets to play p18 eventually, he'd have the corner, too).  And W'd be getting a wall on the 5th line (a bit too high), which probably won't amount to much territory.  See var.]
;W[pi]
(;B[nk]LB[ni:a]C[P: maybe 0-10 better

K: W64 doesn't seem to be a forcing move, so there's no need to take out the O9 stone.  B O11 instead would be more than sufficient and much better than get into an uncertain running battle.   B10 wouldn't be so good (See var.)]
;W[ni];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh]
(;W[lj]C[W should push along a bit more.  See var.]
(;B[jh]C[W70 would've been really bad if B should play M11 now.  See var.]
;W[jj];B[fi]LB[hj:a][kk:b]C[P:  threating to kill 58's group

K:  B73 leaves W too much space to work with.  a would be more severe.  Playing b first might also be a good idea.]
;W[kl];B[lq]LB[gq:a][kn:b]C[P:  i think is wrong

K:  Doesn't seem like an urgent move.  Either a (to stablize own group) or b (to keep on the offensive) would work better.  B75 is not a forcing move (see var.)]

(;W[or]C[W basically gives B a free move here.];B[di]C[P:  consolidating left side to prevent scape

K:  B should keep up the pressure on W58 group more directly here, for a couple of reasons.]

(;W[ci]C[W needn't answer here.  He should settle his center group first.]

(;B[dj]LB[cj:a][ch:b]C[B could have a bigger impact by playing either a or b here.]
;W[ch];B[gq]LB[hj:a][ik:b]C[P:  consolidating  down side

K:  looks like B simply has given up on attacking the W group in the center.  B81 is too far to exert any pressure on W group, which's not quite dead or alive yet.  And after having played B77-79, something like H10 or J9 could generate some profit for B in the middle, even if W manages to live.]

[jl][il][sr][ss][bi][ai]C[P:  too agressive

K:  B does still need to be aggressive, because:

To take a quick count now (being very conservative):

B:  23 (right side) + 12 (UR, with all the aji left) + 9 (top) + 2 (center) + 8 (bottom) = 54

W: 22 (UL) + 15 (LL) + 10 (LR) + 9 (top) + 7 (center) + 0.5 = 63.5

W seems to have a comfortable lead now.  At such a point, given it's B's turn to play, it's more important to grab some large endgame pts than to start attacking a group that's quite secure.  Playing, say, p18 , D2, or G8 (all of which would enlarge a B territory at the expense of a W one) would give B a better chance to come back.]
;W[mf];B[md]C[P:  i should have resigned to this group

K:  agreed.  should've given up this group.  but the game is not over yet.]

;W[eg];B[hm];W[gk]LB[gm:a][hk:b]C[W should simply connect at F13, then start grabbing big endgame pts.  B109 is again too ambiguous.
