[Because Black got sente, he made a solid position on the bottom that
reduces the usefulness of White's thickness. However, the relationship
between the three marked stones is not strong.

White should have taken sente to pincer at 'a' (instead of making the
hane at p8).]
(;W[ef]LB[ck:A]C[The right idea, but the wrong move. C9 looks good since C6 and C12 are miai.]

think of taking the entire left side at this stage.];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq]

top left corner or build his moyo.]

Black's top left corner (see variation)

[if][ig][ih][hh]C[ White was in a losing position because of three mistakes:
1) taking gote with the p8 attack sequence
2)  the big mistake at F3 and
3) taking gote with g9.

Black has now  returned the favour to make the game close since
1) white is threatening to make a huge territory and
2) black's upper left corner can be reduced to nothing.

Black must now be prepared to give up the five stones in
return for reducing the center and either securing his
own corner or invading white's corner. In this case,
Black will still win. If black tries to save his five stones,
he is betting the whole game on a difficult proposition.

I will cease to make comments on the rest of the game since it
is full of mistakes that I think both players can spot.];B[jd];W[ic];B[kd]
