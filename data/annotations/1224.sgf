AB[pd][dp][dd]C[My name is Barry Willey and I played black in this game.   I have been playing a about a year and one half.  I am currently a 12k on NNGS and a 19k on IGS.  I want to thank you in advance for reviewing and commenting on my game.  I am especially interested in comments on the direction of play and why those moves are important.    I have recently hit a plateau of sorts and am trying to improve my play.  I would be interested on any comments you might in that regard.

Thanks again.

Hello Barry, my name is Vince Suttle and I am currently an 8k* on IGS and about 3k in the BGA (British Go Association). My intention is to concentrate on the main points, if you have any comments or would like more explanation please feel free to email me.

I will start the rest ofl my comments with [VS\]. Oh by the way I used WinMGT version 0.83 to comment the game.]

When pincered it is often a good idea to either try to obtain a stable base for  your stones or to get good shape towards the centre. If you attack too early, the attack often fails due to having to defend a weak group.

When playing black in handicap games you don't want to have too many weak stones for your opponent to attack. However you mustn't be too cautious either !

Have a look at the variation which shows the start of a simple but common joseki, to give you some idea of what you could have done instead.]

;W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[hc]C[[VS\] This was quite a good move, it attacks white stone and also extends from your own strong position at the top. It is always a good idea to try and find moves that accomplish more than one thing.]
;W[cc]LB[cd:a][dc:b]C[Q:Could you explain which direction I should have cut (either a or b) and why, relative to the whole board?

[VS\] A very common question. The basic idea is that in this situation you cannot kill white unless he makes a mistake, so black should try to confine him to the corner and build a strong wall on the outside.

Which side depends on where the best prospects for making territory lie. In this position I would have gone for b. But you should be aware that because the black stones at H17 and M17 are low white may well try to reduce your area, much like he did in the actual game.

Look at the variation.]
(;B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[cf];W[bp]C[[VS\]
White is living dangerously. His group in the top left corner is vulnerable and he also has the weak stone at Q9.]

(;B[cn]C[This invasion confused me because I had never seen it before.  I wanted to build a moyo in the center left so I cut at c6.  Any other suggestions ?

[VS\]
This sort of move is a probe, white is looking to see what you do next before deciding whether to play on the left side or dive into the corner.  
Your move looks ok to me, when white goes into the corner you can make a big framework on the left hand side.]
;W[cq]
(;B[dq]C[[VS\] Blacks chances of making territory on the bottom are not great because of the stone at N3, so I would be looking to try and expand the top and the sides instead, where black has a lot of potential.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[jq]C[[VS\]  See how this move reduces the potential of the wall you have made in the bottom left, whilst expanding whites area at the bottom.]
;B[hq]LB[dj:a][dc:b]C[Q:  Was the extension at h3 too small?  What about a to help solidify that area or attack the top left at b?

[VS\]
This is definately too small. It is not much of an attack on the white stones which should have no problem living on the bottom.

Either a play at a or b or even at F16 would have been much better. I quite like the look of F16, which aims to make a really large framework. After playing this move black should look at attacking the white stone at Q9.]
;W[jd]C[[VS\]  Your area at the top is beginning to look big and white needs to do something about it while he still has the chance.

White has not got much territory so far, and black has good prospects on the sides. Black should be looking to attack the white stone in such a way as to build territory on the sides at the same time.

White will have to scramble a bit here to live, and so what if he gets a few points in the centre if you get much more on the sides.]
;B[ge]C[[VS}  This looks ok, it is helping to build the area on the right side, while restricting the stone at F17 and puts some pressure on the stone at K16.]
;W[ld]C[[VS\]  The black stone at M17 is not in real danger as it can connect with the black stones on either side. And even if white does capture it, black can make a much bigger territory on the sides while he does so.]

(;B[jc]C[[VS\]  I didn't like this move. It looks to me like you are too bothered about the territory at the top which is not that big, as your stones are on the second line.]

(;W[mc];B[kc];W[kd];B[md]
(;W[oe]C[[VS\]
See the variation.];B[nd];W[od];B[mb]C[[VS\]  This lets white off too easy. The two white stones can't escape so I would move out with N15 instead which put pressure on the three white stones.

However you would need to keep a close eye on your stones on the right. They are beginning to look a little weak.]
;W[me]C[[VS\]
This is why I would have preferred to play here on the last move.]
;B[nb];W[ne]
(;B[pf]C[[VS\]  Your stones at the top are secure and this move does not threaten white much.  
If you wanted to attack white you could cut at M15 and split white into two groups but see the variations.

Instead a peek at M14 looks more interesting. It threatens to cut and will have an effect on whites eye shape.

Alternatively you could look at strengthening your stones in the bottom left first. It is often a good idea to secure a weak group prior to attacking. The danger is in playing too defensively. See variation 3.]
;W[kg];B[ng]C[[VS\]
I don't think this does enough. It does not seriously threaten white who should be able to live from this position.

I would be more interested in securing the left hand side a bit more.

Your stones at P6 and R6 can either connect to your stones above them, or move towards the corner or run into the centre.]
;W[nk];B[mn]C[[VS\]  These stones are running into neutral territory, I would be more interested in securing their eye space at the moment, i.e. a play at S4 as suggested earlier.]
;W[lk];B[jj]C[[VS\]
No I didn't like this move. It doesn't help you  to make any territory anywhere and neither is it much of an attack on white. If you want to attack white then you could try splitting him in two by playing at M11.]
;W[li];B[if]C[[VS\]
The left side needs a stone!];W[cj]C[Wasn't quite sure how to handle this invasion.  Would it have been better to be more aggressive.  Perhaps a shoulder hit?

[VS\]
This is going to make quite a bit of damage to you potential area. There should be enough room here for white to live without too much difficuty.

Picture the difference if you had played here  instead of your last move.
I would probably have ignored it for now and attacked white who still has several weak areas.

The white stones in the top left are weak as mentioned earlier. Also white stones in the centre are still weak.]
;B[cl];W[ch];B[ek];W[ei];B[eg];W[gi];B[di]LB[gk:a]C[I was unsure whether I should attack his formation before he connected up or if I should have just played at g9, fencing out some territory.

[VS\]
I think playing at "a" would have been a better choice. Not only does it help to fence off some territory, it also reaches out a hand to the stone at K10.

You can take away the base of the whites stone at any time by playing at B11.]
;W[dh];B[dj];W[eh];B[ci];W[ej]
(;B[ck]C[[VS\]  No this move is too easy on white.

See the variation.];W[fk]C[Q: I felt like I had handled the invasion ok up to this point; however, he seemd to get too much influence in the remaining moves.  What suggestions do you have that you think would have ended on a better result for black?]
;B[fl];W[el];B[dk];W[gl];B[fm];W[hk]C[My next move was at j12.  I don't think that was a good move.  Do you think I would have been better off moving at g7? (see var.)

[VS\]
White has reasonable shape and black has been pushed fairly flat here. Not good.]

(;B[ih];W[gm];B[gn]C[[VS\]
If you want to protect your territory on the left then I think F6 might be better. It gives white less to leverage off.

However your stones there  are not in any real danger so you could have tried a move at K8, which would help to keep the white stones divided whilst reaching out towards the three  stones on the 6th line.]
;W[fn];B[em];W[hn];B[go];W[ho]C[I was now faced with trying to make the stones along the 6th line live and was unsure of the best approach.

[VS\]
See the variation for a simplest way.]

;W[jp];B[jo];W[jn];B[hm]C[Slack move.  I didn't read this out very well.  I think I would have been better off with l6.

[VS\]
Yes I think L6 would have been better. But remember this area is still fairly small. There are more points to be had elsewhere.]
;W[io];B[ko];W[jm];B[kn];W[jl];B[qq]C[Another move that seemed to create more problem than it helped.  However, my options seemed limited.  While I lived in the corner, my group along the sixth line got squeezed pretty tight.

Black had plenty of chances in this game. You need to take the fight to your opponent more.

I don't know if you have been reading any books or if you have any available to you.  I would reccommend reading a good book on Life and Death and one on Tesuji (good moves in a local context) to sharpen your general tactical play and reading ability.  
The elementary go series and the Get Strong at Go series are both very good. Other good reads for someone at your level are the Graded Go Problems for beginners and Learn to Play Go, both of which have 4 volumes.

Try not to leave too many weak stones on the board at once. And try to find moves that do more than one thing, ie extend from your own territory while attacking your opponents stones.

There was lots more I could have pointed out but I thought that this should hopefully help.

If you have any comments or questions please don't hesitate to contact me by email.

Blacks stones on the right should be pretty safe for the time being, meaning that he can go after white without having to worry about them.

When you have some weak stones not far from your opponents weak stones he can often strengthen his by counter-attacking against yours.

White has plenty to worry about now, and none of blacks stones are in any serious danger.]

(;B[nj]C[[VS\]
A move something like this would put the white stone at Q9 in trouble while also helping to building up the right side. It would also help to attack white top stones if he tries to run them out into the centre.

It is often a good idea to build up a stronger position a little bit away from the stones you really want to attack and then drive them towards your new strong position.

If white now plays at the top you could ignore it and play around C10 so help secure the left side.]
))
(;B[dc]C[[VS\]
Even a simple play like this applies pressure to white. If he ignores this his 3 stones in the corner are likely to die, plus it makes a big difference to your territory at the top.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[ca];B[ec]C[[VS\]
Blacks position looks pretty good to me at the top. If white plays somewhere around K16 to reduce blacks framework, black will make territory on the sides while chasing white into the centre.  
If you look at whites territory around the board so far it doesn't add up to much, and he still has weak sotnes for black to go after.]

If you had done something like this it would have helped to prevent some of the difficulties you got into later in this  part of the board.]
