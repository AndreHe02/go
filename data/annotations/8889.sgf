Hi reviewer. I'm 'rarellano 4k' (white), I lost this game for about 11 points. The game was close until yose. I want a general review on my style of play . Hopefully found some missed big points in the game and reveal the mistakes.]
(;B[pp];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[jp];W[cn];B[do]
(;W[bp];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm]C[Here are several variations I have seen in pro games.]
(;W[dl]LB[cl:A]C[This is an overplay since black's cut at A is a problem.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[cl]
(;W[ck]C[maybe the direction of this atari was wrong. "Yes"]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj]LB[an:A][cq:B][cr:C]C[White now has two groups to manage. The question is how best to do this.

The first task is to keep the corner group alive.
For that we need a move at one of the A, B or C points and we will end in gote.

If we do that now black will get good play against the outside group so my idea would be to try and strengthen it before living in the corner.]
(;W[ek]LB[el:A]C[Here I think A is better shape.]
(;B[ci];W[an]
(;B[pn]LB[ei:B][ej:A][fk:C][gk:D][fl:E]C[This black move looks cramped to me.

I'm not sure what the strongest play is here for white. I would consider one of the A-E spots for the next move. 
In any event I think your group needs help right now and any move you make will strengthen it a lot.

Other than that you can still invade the bottom.]
(;W[ql]TR[pn]C[Black's delta stone is very strong so I would not want to play close to it like this.]
(;B[qm];W[pl]C[VERY BAD exchange for black.];B[jc]
(;W[ml]LB[qo:B][or:A]C[I think this move is misplaced. It violates the corner-side-center priority. Since the bottom right is still open (e.g. at A) you don't need to fear a black move at this point. Additionally black has a weakness at B.]
;B[rm]C[very small];W[mn]C[Again I'd go a lot deeper or defend the left-center group.]
;B[nc];W[qf];B[pb];W[qc];B[mp]LB[lc:A]TR[ml][mn]C[With this move it becomes very hard to reduce the bottom. But I think that black is way ahead so if I were white I would try something desparate. The problem is that the left-center group is so weak and the marked stones give no territory to white.

Also note that black has left a weakness at A.];W[cg]C[This is the natural point to squeeze the black stones but the black group is stronger than the white group so this is not a good place to start a fight without first strengthing the white group.]
;B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[fi];B[dj];W[dk];B[fh];W[gj];B[eg]
(;W[dg]LB[eh:A]C[Doesn't do much.

This move doesn't take the corner or strengthen the outside white group. Both of which are urgent items. It is essentially a shape move to kill a black eye at A which means you are trying to kill the black group but that is much too ambitious in this position.]
(;B[fc]C[A territory grubbing move and not a particularly good one either.

I think the game will hinge on the fate of the white center-left group. Not so much whether it lives or dies (I assume it will live) but on how much black will make out of attacking it.]
(;W[fd];B[ec];W[ed]C[An interesting way to play. Puts good pressure on black's group.]
;B[gd]
(;W[dc]LB[hc:A]C[But now changes horses in the middle of the stream. If you want the corner it is best not to make black strong on the outside. Now you don't have the move at A which I mentioned earlier.If nothing else you would have liked to make black defend that in gote.]
;B[hc]C[Black seems bent on handing the initiative back to  you in exchange for a few points.]
(;W[ge]C[This move needs to be used to strengthen the white group.]
;B[gi];W[fj];B[hi]TR[ge]C[And black plays well here. Notice how little work the delta stone is doing for you.]
(;W[hj]C[Pushing from behind. Better to jump ahead if you can.]
;B[ii]
(;W[gn]C[I think this is too vague. 

It doesn't really connect. If black answers below he secures territory and can still attack your group later.]
;B[gp]C[maybe was better hit the 3-3 directly.

Just using the built in score estimater white is behind by almost 40 points.]

You do a good job of reducing black but there is not enough play in the position to come back.]
