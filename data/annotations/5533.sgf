-- Hi Michael!
My name is Sven and I´m somewhere between 9 k (slow game, Dragon Go Server) and 14-12 k (KGS). I hope I will be able to give some useful hints to you. If something remains unclear, feel free to tell me. 
I have put "--" in front of  my comments so you can better spot them.

I think you and your opponent were not much apart as in terms of strength, as suggested by your KGS ranking. What made White lead most of the time was the advantage he gained from the opening game. To start with, you should stick to the rule "First the corners, then the edges, after that the center". And try to remember that the 3rd line aims at territory, the 4th line at influence towards the center. 
Both players left their corners open to invasion, as you realised in the end.

As for the rest, which concerns mostly reading a local situation and applying the best local move, you made some mistakes (as did you opponent), which I tried to highlight in my commentaries. If you are eager to improve fast, try and read about some basic shapes (good and bad shape) and capturing races in Sensei´s library for example.

Hope this helps.. :-)];B[op]C[Masuran [23k\]: Hello];W[dd]C[Sasuke10 [21k\]: hi]
;B[nd]C[-- a bit far away from the corner...];W[jj]C[Can you tell me why he made this move? I wouldn't make a move like this one because I think it really neglects the lower left corner.

-- no I can´t! The next move should be in the corner indeed]
;B[pg]C[Here I didn't enter the lower left corner because I wanted to be friendly to my opponent. Turns out I should have invaded that corner.

-- yes :-)];W[jp]
(;B[mq]LB[kq:A]C[Play wider here? Like at A?

-- Now you should definitely establish a position in the left corner.]
;W[dp];B[pl];W[dj];B[kd]C[-- Now compare with the result in the variation - here White has occupied most of the board, while Black´s stones are overconcentrated.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[gd]C[Here I felt pretty lost, It looks like he took control of half the board and that I should have invaded the lower left.

-- You´re quite right - just take your courage and invade!
(see the variations)]

(;B[kq]LB[jr:A]C[Is A better? I made this move because it works towards my stone at N3

;W[cq]C[This move should allert me for my group that only has 2 liberties left, but I failed to see it. Is there a way out of a situation like this?

-- No.  You just can try not to donate your opponent even more stones in a desperate attempt to save yaou group. Perhaps you can make some points out of it by using it as a ko threat or by expanding a different group in sente.]
