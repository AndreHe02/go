C[Here is a game I played as white against the program ManyFaces, who recently got crushed at 7 stones by Kim Myungwon 7p. Kim said this bot plays more like a human than mogo, but mogo is stronger at tsumego.

I believe I fell behind early, and only won when the bot made a mistake during ko for seki. Comments from all stages of the game are welcome.

K: I will put K before all of my comments. I took the oppurtunity of studying a bit of joseki with your first question. I put many of my comments and thoughts about the situation. I am not an expert on Joseki like some people are, but theres are things I might consider when reviewing a joseki after a game. It's a joseki that I have not seem before, so hopefuly we can try to figure out what white should have done.

K: sorry I was so slow, but it was interesting and I wanted to spend more time on it. If you have anymore questions feel free to ask me. I am Kilroy on KGS]

(;W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[kq];W[pe];B[qg];W[pg]C[is this a bad move?

K: Well the way I see it is that contact moves are generally used in three situations. 1. When you want to settle quickly 2. When you want to start a fight 3. When you want to try to make your oppenent over concentrated. So this is a move I wouldn't have considered. 

I think this move is also used in special situations although I cannot think of one where I would prefer this move over another move, unless maybe I had a very close wall on the top, like somewhere around L16. This move would try to keep me from becoming overconcentrated, and try to kill the Q17 stone.

It seems difficult for me to see a fighting joseki when white has no near stones.]

(;W[og];B[qf]
(;W[oh];B[pi]C[K: By here you did not accomplish any of the 3 reasons that contact moves are played, there was no fight, black is not over concentrated, and you are not settled.]
;W[oc]C[K: So you contact again.]
(;B[od]C[K: I feel like this is an overplay for black, black can play more simple and make your shape bad on a larger scale, or just play the big move on the board.

Also this makes your contact move a move that starts a fight.]

;B[me];W[md]C[I think this corner played out to b's advantage, but I don't know my joseki well and can't say exactly where I went wrong.

K: I think the corner ended well for where white was on the board, but it is true that black's thickness is in the direction that black wants it.]
;B[hd]
(;W[pm]C[this move was a difficult choice. I feared that if I played upper or left then black would make too big a moyo, but didn't know where to place within his sphere of influence.

K: well this is clearly an invastion, and as such you usually do not want a 4th line move because that means it is already floating before the counter has even begun.]
;B[op];W[qo]
(;B[ro];W[po];B[pp];W[rn]C[K: this outcome is good for white, now that white has the S4 move and a move like R10 in reserve it is very hard to kill it.]
;B[le];W[kd];B[jf]
(;W[ok]C[K: this move looks weird to me, it looks like you want to make your group stronger while treatening to save the 3 stones. Also the P12 stones are not very big.]

(;W[nj];B[mj];W[pj];B[gq]C[K: here black was able to get a few moves in sente before responding to your move, if you are confident your move is bigger then dont' respond to his move. It is hard for me to say how much defending your group was though, so game might still be the way to go.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[hq]C[K: this is bad since the move does not work, once you do this the move of J2 is gone after black defends. if you wanted E5 best to just play that first.]
