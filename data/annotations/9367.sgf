It's ok, from this game you could try to improve reducing technique for black territory (N10 stone was good, but not continued!), and to check in late middle game and yose to not answer to your opponent last move but to play the biggest move! :)

Thanks a lot for letting me review your game and I hope that it will be useful to you!
