C[Elathalion [7k\]: hi
Elathalion [7k\]: gl fh
So this game I played against lambe who had a question mark next to his rank... After the game I asked him whether he realistically is a 6k and he said he was stronger..
I thought I look at this game and review it because it might help a lot to see where I usually go wrong.

J: Hi my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments will start with "J:"]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]LB[cd:A]C[lambe [6k?\]: hi
Maybe A was better because it sets up a good follow up in the next move... The left becomes big.

J: Q3 is playable.];W[dd];B[qk]C[low chinese against him playing some thing similar..]
;W[dk]LB[jq:G][fq:B][jp:F][dp:A][po:E][dd:C][fc:D]C[He goes for high chinese sort of..
Now here are my thoughts:
In chinese black tries to build a moyo usually right and bottom side are aimed for..  but because of D3 I have no good way to approach the lower left corner. If whites stone was at A I could approach at B. Therefore I approach the C stone at D and aim to build my moyo that way.
Other moves I considered were E and F or G, However that felt small. For E i probably answered by white G and. For G or F I still would like to get the enclosure.

In hindsight I suppose G might be best.

J: There's nothing wrong with D.  G feels a bit low, considering it will become a moyo game, so F is better.  Another option is approach at G4, see varaition.]

(;B[fc];W[df];B[jd]C[So far so good ... He defends high and I take the upper side.]
;W[jp]LB[jp:A]
(;B[lq]LB[lq:B][jp:A]C[So now he gets in the big move at A and I try and rescue some of that side with B also trying to get him to play another move there.

J: M3 is once again a bit low for the lind of game this is developing into, but is playable.  One option is to play N4 to help the right side, while aiming to pincer at G4.  See variation.]
;W[lo]
(;B[jr];W[iq]C[He caps and I slide.. maybe O4 was better? I still feel I owe a move here.. and he retains sente.

J: Yes, diving at K2 feels like it's helping white solidify the left side. Instead of O4, the normal shape is O3, it's stronger and it gives white less aji to work with.  See variaitons.]
;B[np]C[J: O4 is necessary now.];W[pl]C[then the shoulder hit...

J: Shoulder hit is good timing now.];B[pk]C[I stand up to get at least the upper part of the right.

J: Q9 is the correct direction, as opposed to R8.];W[nl]
(;B[pn]LB[nj:A][mn:B][do:C]C[he jumps and I take Q4... I thought that was good but I might be wrong.
 His moyo is getting bigger while I am reduced... but I suppose I would play Q4 again.. it puts some pressure on Q8 and N8 while taking lots of points.

J: Locally, Q6 is incorrect, the tesuji here is the clap at Q7.  See variation.

J: Globally, Q6 area is really slow, because the bottom group is alreadly alive and strong. Some ideas are: making the moyo bigger with O10, or splitting white to start a fight with N6, or diving deep with D5.]
;W[no];B[oo]C[Attach and hane... Would I have better extended?to P4?

J: P5 is ok.];W[nn];B[ol]C[J: Small. Should tenuki.];W[nk];B[om]
LB[om:A]C[This is slow... I can get that stone on Q8 whenever I want.


But what better .. I need to get into the lower left...

J: correct.];W[nm];B[jj]TR[co][do]LB[nk:A][dd:B]C[This is probably bad... But I thought it is right at the edge of his moyo.. I did not play this for being tengen.If you draw a line from A to B I am just inside..And If I connect or gain life I can destroy the lower left centre.

J: I would still try to start at C5 or D5, it's still very wide.]
;W[ok];B[oi];W[mp]C[This might be slow from him.. Maybe I shoould have given up that two stones on the bottom and just gotten in deeper.. K8 or so ... starting something in that area..]

(;B[nq]C[J: Simply blocking at N3 works.  See variaion.];W[mq]
;B[mr]C[So far so good..];W[op]
(;B[pp]LB[oq:A]C[I think A would have been a lot better

J: Yes, Q4 is a blunder.];W[on];B[pm]C[J: Hard to find a good response now.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[lr]C[And so I get taken apart...];B[nr];W[kq]
C[Again I should just take sente... Some move in the middle...

J: This is very painful for black, but white should have tenuki instead.  Black can still save K2 in the endgame, see variation.]

(;B[oo]TR[mi]C[J: very small.  Should instead be at N11];W[qc]

(;B[pc]TR[qk][jd][pk]MA[hc]C[J: direction here is questionable, since black is farther on the bottom side than top.  F17 cannot be counted because of invasion at H17.  See variation.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[qg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]
TR[mi][rh]C[standard joseki .. I guess this was fine... blocking the other wy sould be worse But now I lost sente and I am behind... next white reduces my area and I lose..

J: having both of these open is distasteful, so I would have preferred the other direction.]
;W[ni];B[nh]TR[do][co]LB[ng:10][nf:9][ne:8][oh:7][og:6][of:5]
[oe:4][pg:3][pf:2][pe:1]C[J: The game is getting very hard for black. 

J: One way to tank about this move is: you're only protecting 10 points, in exchange for hurting K10.  I would still consider an invasion on the left side.]
;W[mi];B[mh];W[ki]LB[lh:A]C[what can I do .. A and white simpy connects. and then my middle stone is as good a s lost.]

(;B[ji]C[J: black K11 is ok, K10 desperately needs help.];W[lh]
;B[lg]TR[dh]C[J: At this point, there's no time to simply take territory, black needs a crazier plan.  Black can try something like D12 to attack D14 stones.]
;W[kg];B[ej]TR[dh]C[bad move... I let white in and the shoulder hit??? does not to too much to help my middle...
I guess the game was just over ....

J: shoulder hitting a 4th line stone is rarely a good idea.  Should still consider D12  here.]
;W[di]C[J: D11 is a mistake, white should just play D10 to be solid.]
;B[dj];W[cj]
(;B[jg]C[J: Can try to sue white's weakness on the left side.  See variations.]
;W[lf];B[mg];W[jf];B[if]
(;W[ig]C[J: J13 is wron direction for white, K13 is obvious.]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[hg];W[ie];B[hf]C[Some hope for my middle group but the top seems destroyed...]
;W[ke]C[J: strange move, K15 would have sufficed.];B[je];W[ck]
;B[kf];W[ec];B[jf]C[this was quite good for me.. for the first time there is a small comeback possible..

J: taking the ko is large, but black should still try to reduce the bottom left side first.  Black has many ko threats.]
;W[ek]C[J: after E9 it becomes orders of magitude harder to invade the left side.]
;B[fj]TR[cq]C[J: no time time to be slow here.  Should immediately drop a stone at C3 to see what happens.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[gl];B[hk];W[hl];B[il];W[im];B[jl]C[J: All these moves solidified white's corner, and now it's almost impossible to invade.

J: This is my last comment.  Black fell behind in this game with many slow moves that gave up sente.  I tink the take away from this game is how to play efficient moves that can take sente.

J: Thanks for showing me this game.];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[hb]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[fg];W[kr];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch]C[stupid move.. just toesnt work.]
