C[This is my first review. It was fun. I hope the comments are usefull

[MAFU\]
Hello! Thank you very much for taking the time to review this game. I (4k) played black in an even game against Philogo, 2k.

I had no special plans for the fuseki. The game soon developed into a massive fight. I could have played it simple a few times but i decided to keep attacking for fun. ;)

I experienced time pressure after less than 100 moves and my game got worse (lots of misreads due to lack of time). I'm extremely bad at blitz fights :(

The game was left unfinished in chuban.

Please point out my mistakes. I'm especially interested in joseki choice and direction of play. Please also show me shape mistakes. Since the game was mostly a fight, i'm interested in strategic and positional judgement of important positions.

I hope i'm not demanding too much :) Thank you again!];B[pd]

very normal opening so far, but i dislike white's lower left a bit.]

is this really a good spot to invade?]

shouldn't white defend his r5 invasion first?]

i knew playing here might turn out very dangerous, but i wanted to test my fighting ability. in a serious game, i'd play p11 instantly.]

we stopped playing here because i had to leave.

am i mistaken, or did white just die in gote?

is there a way for black to exploit the aji in the upper left?
