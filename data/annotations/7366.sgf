C[Hi Campbell,

I'm Dieter (dv), a 2d from Belgium. I'll be happy to review your game.

Judging from this game I can indeed see a balanced approach, neither greedy nor slow. You display good overall middle game technique and resistance. Resistance is in my opinion what distinguishes dan potential. I only see elementary mistakes in endgame techniques and endgame judgment. Indeed, that is likely to be the area where you can progress most. Richard Bozulich' "Get strong at the end game" is an amazing resource.

The main theme in this game is your choice to build a large moyo and treat the groups on the upper side as disposable (or not). I would have treated the upper left as disposable, but not given up the upper side group as a whole. Most of the comments relate to these treatments.

In the end you could have tried to kill the invasion in the lower right, and probably should from a strategic standpoint,  although the game was still close enough to justify your decision.

If you want to iterate this review with more questions, be my guest.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[de];B[fd];W[dh]LB[cc:A]C[dv: This move shows that you have a good sense of opening moves and techniques, which is not acquired through root memorization of joseki. I think that is a virtue. However, it can be interesting to inquire for yourself why this move is not joseki, and A is almost invariably played.]
;B[pc];W[pe];B[nd];W[qh]C[dv: Same here.];B[jc]C[dv: But this move by Black is just as slow. His forces are overconcentrated;]
;W[qn]LB[qh:A][cn:C][pn:B][fq:D]C[dv: This move is too low for my taste. With A low already, a move at B would strike a better balance between development and stability. Another option is to approach the lower left.]
;B[cj];W[jq]C[dv: This move makes a statement "I'm going to build a moyo. My stones in the upper left will be treated lightly: when under attack, I'll sacrifice a part"]
;B[gq];W[jo]C[dv: This move reinforces that statement and invites Black to further attack the upper left.]
;B[bh]C[dv: Black does not attack on a large scale. Hence, you can play very lightly. Here's an exercise: where would you play to make a large scale attack difficult, in the meantime increasing your claim to make a moyo?]

(;W[cc]C[dv: Attaching is also a sabaki technique.];B[cb]
(;W[cd]C[dv: However, this connection makes a heavy group. Now the group must be saved as a whole, not as easy to shed your skin.

See var for another possibility.];B[bb];W[ec];B[ed];W[dd];B[db]
;W[fh];B[ff];W[bf];B[cg];W[dg];B[cf];W[ef];B[fe]
(;W[kd]C[dv: This is an overplay, inspired by envy. Indeed, you would like to reduce the upper side now that it is becoming territory, but your upper left group is still too weak to afford and leave it. Instead ...]

(;B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[lg]C[dv: The result is ok. Black has submitted to your forcing moves.]
;B[fg]
(;W[eg]C[dv: This move just adds to the weight of the group to defend. The four stones in the corner add no value but their 2 points each. I would sacrifice them. See var.]
;B[ei];W[di]
(;B[ej]C[dv: Poor technique by Black. See var.];W[dj];B[dk]
;W[ck];B[bj];W[ek];B[dl];W[fk];B[gh];W[fi];B[gi];W[gj]C[dv: Good.]
;B[li]C[dv: This is a good attack by Black.];W[qd];B[qc];W[rc]
C[dv: This is endgame. Connecting the upper central stones is bigger]
;B[pd];W[qe];B[oe];W[og];B[of]
(;W[pg]C[dv: good technique, the last 2 moves

But the choice to sacrifice the stones for a moyo is made here. Myself I would have played something like the variation.

(;W[ie];B[jd];W[hd];B[gc];W[cq]LB[gn:A]C[dv: I've let the whole debate in the middle for what it is. Exploring all the tactics there would lead us too far. You made the choice to sacrifice the large group in return for a majestic moyo. This leaves us with two counting exercises, two tactical questions and a strategic one.

1a) How big is the upper territory? 
1b) And how big is the white moyo?
2a) Can Black still invade the moyo?
2b) How about the cut at A?
3) Where to play?

I'll pause for your answers. You have chosen to invade the corner. Was it based on judgment like the above?]
;B[dq]C[
1a) How big is the upper territory? - 70 
1b) And how big is the white moyo? - 90
2a) Can Black still invade the moyo? - my feeling is yes, but somehow the weakness of the wall must be exploited. I cannot calculate such a thing.
2b) How about the cut at A? - White can live
3) Where to play?

I believe you did right, but then Black will invade your moyo. If he lives, he will still win I think.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]
(;W[am]LB[bp:A][dr:B]C[dv: this is an elementary endgame mistake: look at the weakness at A. Moreover, this move is not urgent. B is bigger. The question is: can White tenuki, and defend the moyo? Will Black be able to kill?

See var];B[bl];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eo]C[dv: very slow move by Black! Now you can reinforce your moyo and win the game.]

(;W[mm]C[dv: I thought you had to play in the corner of the moyo. But indeed, perfecting this wall allows you to chase any invasion to death.]
;B[qq];W[qp];B[pp]
(;W[oq]C[Here you could have resisted and try to kill the invasion. See var.]
;B[rp];W[qo];B[qr]C[dv: This group lives and now the game is very close.
