Playing for moyo is is hard for Black, because of all the open room and White's space in the P3 area

Right now, if Black were to play for territory, the game would be very close.]

(;B[cg]C[This was way too far. Also, Black's stone is going to be swallowed up. See variations.

Although joseki, with strong white stones on both sides, White can really mess with Black.]

overall it was a fine game. Both players made mistakes, but Blacks were more severe. 

Be sure to watch forcing points and dangers moves or aji left behind.

right here, unless Black kills a big group, it doesn't look like he can win.

As for shape, be sure that if you're going to play chinese fuseki, that you stick with that top and focus on not letting the territory go. The whole point is to develop fast territory. However, looking at the fuseki now, it looks like Black forgot all about his stones.

Also, the reduced moyo was very sad. Remember to play forcing moves that develop a wall as shown in one variation. Giving White sente in this situation was a losing variable.

It was a very intresting game. I was very surprised that both players knew the joseki so well!]
