AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, my name is shade. I'll made a review for white.
Hope my comments would be useful for you.

If you have any questions about rewiev, be free to e-mail me at shadew@gmail.com

Enjoy the review!


About comments: be free to add more expanded comments to explain, what goal you hish to acheive with your moves.


As the resume for whole game:
 You played well, exept few moves in the middle-game, that allows black to go ahead.
 If you count the result - you lost just 5.5 points, it means that you had chosen right strategy.

 Main mistakes, I think, are:
  slow moves;
  leaving big threats in own position;
  too calm game when you must attack.];W[dd];B[pp];W[cn];B[gq]
(;W[ck]C[Would d10 be better?



* This is ok. Both moves playable.
You get strong position on the side.

After wD10, black can attack later (see variation).

Playing handicap game, I will also prefer C9 rather then D10.]
;B[jp];W[nc]C[Good, you're making great framework];B[pf]
(;W[pc]MA[pn]C[Is this a good play? Felt right to get some corner and gladly he responded, so I could still get some more territory.


* This move still ok, it depends on your stile.
Of course, playing handicap game you want to start fight as quickly as possible and make your opponent make mistakes...


Also possible wQ18, it allows to keep game quite and flexible
Or you can even tenuki, e.g. wQ6.];B[qc]
(;W[pb]C[Because of previous idea, I think better to play R18 and start fight, it looks favourable for white.]
;B[qb]
(;W[jd]MA[ob][ld]C[After this exchange you have worse result, then black.

You create weak point nearby M16 and  P18 for the future.

Better was to play M16 then.

Look through variations and comments at the end of each variation.]
(;B[pl]
(;W[qh]C[Is this a good time for invasion? I think maybe securing some territory in C14 would be better.



* Yes, time for invasion is good..

If you continue secure corner, it will be harder to invade, and black can secure more territory then you.
Also you can invade at 3-3 point yourself (like black did it at bC17), try it in your future games. Generally, this invasion ends in sente.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[bd];W[df]C[Could I defend like this and still keep the corner? things went wrong from here on.



You can't keep corner - corner is alive in any case. It is impossible to kill black (see 3-3 invasion joseki).
But you get influence to center. This is fair exchange];B[db]
;W[eb];B[cb];W[ab]MA[fc][ec]C[What could I have done now? still any hope for saving the corner?



* You must defend cutting point at E17]
(;B[ba];W[da];B[ac];W[bb];B[ae];W[af]C[Probably didn't need this last one, right? too small of a play it seems now.]
;B[ca]
(;W[ea]C[Still wF17 is urgent and better..];B[oh];W[qk];B[ql]
;W[rk];B[rl]
(;W[ok]MA[oj]C[what do you think about this? I ended up with this stone cut.

It should be at P10 - it is further from black's wall.

On the other hand cutted stone can be also usefull..];B[pk]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[pi];B[oi]
(;W[ol]C[You can start run just now with O9.];B[om];W[nk]MA[mk]
C[This is first, I think, big mistake in you play..
While trying to save dead stones later you allow black to get stong position in center and didn't get reasonable exchange for yourself.

You can run with N9 or N8.];B[bp];W[qq]C[Good invasion!];B[qp]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rr];B[mm]
(;W[pm]MA[rf]C[this cut went so wrong, what should I do with the 3 stones group at p9? Extend to the middle?


I think you can sacrifice them and build influence or to run with M9 or N10.

Anyway, wQ7 is deffinetly wrong direction to play.

By the way, wR9 group can be killed. Try to imagine black plays S14 first..]
;B[qm];W[pn];B[on];W[qn];B[rn];W[sl]C[By last 5 moves you lost lot of useful ko-threats..
Better to keep such moves  for future, if you'll get ko-fight.]
;B[rm];W[po];B[oo]
(;W[qf]C[Is this move too small? I was guessing it was sente, but if he had ignored it I would feel stupid.

Good move!
Also you can play S14.];B[qe];W[qg]MA[rf]C[S14 another option.]
;B[pg];W[he]SQ[ec]MA[ij][hj][jh][ji][ii]C[This moves looks useless because of 2 reasons:
 * you have a weakness at E17;
 * this is too small move for expanding moyo - better something nearby K12.]
;B[lk]C[and now those 3 are dead? did not fell like such a loss though.

Yes, you're right, you can sacrifice them.];W[en];B[mj];W[fl]
MA[hj][ii][gk][hi][gj]C[This is too small move. Again look at H10 or something like this.]

You should count before and realize, that you're still behind about 20 points, you must be more agressive..

Yes, you're right. Options I mark..


Also looks good some probe at C3 or J11.
They are more risky, but you're behind and can think about such variants..
Of course, try to count before making move and deside between possibilities and lack of points.]

Ok, this was the last comment. There is no threats left for white.

Still E17 must be secured, but black didn't see it for your lucky.]
