C[crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2d.  I find games like this, where nothing much happens, difficult to review, so I don't have as many comments as usual.  It seems to me that all the damage was done early in the opening, followed by quite a peaceful/meaningless middlegame and endgame.  White got behind quickly and, except for the ko that developed, never made an attempt to change the course of the game.]

;B[qf];W[rb];B[rd];W[qo];B[ne];W[md]LB[lc:B][mc:A]C[crux: I don't like this move.  It does very little to stabilize your group; Black is able to attack it later.  In terms of territory it is small.  It also has no effect on any of Black's positions.  A move at A would do more for your shape, but like the game move it would also feel slow.  B would have a small effect on Black's position.  Tenuki may be possible, but expect Black to attack.]
;B[qk];W[jp]LB[dj:A]C[crux: Black really wants the point A to finish his double wing formation.  Maybe it would be better to play there in order to foil his plan.]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[dj]C[crux: Black got exactly the position he wanted.  His moyo in the top left is bigger than White's at the bottom.]
;W[bp]LB[je:A]C[crux: Too small, I think.  Black can expand his position faster than you can.  He has an ideal point at A.]

C[crux: The last two moves seem a bit crude to me.  They force Black to take territory, while adding little to your position.  This is a heavy way of playing.]

(;W[oc]C[crux: Throughout the whole game, at every point, Black gets exactly what he wants.  Fighting spirit requires that you at least consider blocking Black's path; then you need to read out the result.]

C[crux: You've made five defensive moves in a row, while Black has been surrounding territory on two sides. While your groups are relatively safe now (the shape is still somewhat poor), it seems that Black has more points in secure territory than White has in potential (since the lower side can't be counted as all white).  On top of that, White's top right group seems weaker than Black's top center group.  I'm tempted to call it game over at this point.]

;B[oq];W[pp];B[gn];W[jn]LB[op:A][or:B]C[crux: Meaningless move on a neutral point?  How about attacking at A or B?  It's Black's only weak group on the board.]
