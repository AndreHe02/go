;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[op];B[jp]LB[qp:A]C[Approaching the corner at A is more usual.]
;W[qp];B[pj]C[it's an important point];W[dj]LB[cn:A][nc:B]C[I prefer A or B  instead of this white move, but of course this is not a bad move.]
;B[jc];W[fp]LB[cn:A]C[I don't think it is the correct side to approach. Playing at A is enough.]
;B[dn];W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[hq]LB[cr:A]TR[jp]C[Black should finish the joseki instead of this move. The marked stone is light, it is difficult for white to attack it.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[ck]C[Strange move, white is happy to solidify is position here. I think It is more natural to move toward the center for black.]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[cp]LB[lq:A]C[This doesn't work very good. White is eliminating aji (potential for later) here. Just play at A, which is very big. The white group is not in danger.]
;B[bp];W[co];B[bo];W[do];B[cn];W[eo]C[White is completely safe but black too. And white is gote. Black is quite satisfied.]
;B[bj]LB[mq:A]C[No, should really be at A.];W[lq]C[Good move.]
;B[mq]C[black doesn't need to play such move here I think. The situation can soon be out of control.]
;W[mp]LB[lp:A]C[white at A is worth considering, it seperate black in two. Since the white group on the left is secure and the shimari on the
right is strong, black will have a very hard time dealing with his groups.]
;B[lp]C[black can sabaki (make shape lightly)  with the crosscut]
;W[lr];B[np];W[mo];B[nq];W[no];B[kq];W[oq];B[kr];W[nr]LB[lo:A]
C[white should play the kikashi (forcing move) at A before.]
;B[fr];W[gq]C[this move is not very good. Black is looking for eyes, don't help him to get some.]
;B[gr];W[hp];B[iq];W[qk]TR[mp][mo][no][op][qp][oq]LB[pg:A]C[this is not a good move. It's too low, and doesn't use the fact that white's marked stone are very thick.
If you want to use this thickness, I think A is a good point. Thickness should not be used to make territory, but to
attack.];B[pk];W[pl];B[qj];W[rk];B[ol];W[pm]C[It is a real success for black, white is overconcentred in the lower right, and black has build thickness.]
;B[df]TR[cj][dj]C[now, i got problems with the two marked stones . Can you  assess this position and tell me if the situation on the left of the board is good for white/black?

the white stones are not so much in danger. It is difficult to answer your question, black has played more move in this
part of the board, so it's normal that he has an advantage, no reason to be alarmed about that.]
;W[fd]LB[fc:A]C[Since black is looking after your two stones, perhaps you should play at A instead of your move to stabilize the top
more quickly and have more time for them.];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd]
;W[bc];B[de]
(;W[ch]LB[eh:A]C[It is difficult to assess the position, but I wouldn't have played here. A  come to my mind, but I'm not sure here.  I think nevertheless that playing higher is better. Have a look at the variation to see why I like a play at A.]
;B[dh];W[di]TR[ch]LB[dk:A]C[this move is not good. First it is bad shape and secondly the marked stone is not important. If black  uses two moves to capture it, you save the other stones. I think A is better in this position.]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[bg];W[ed]C[Now you are really in danger : your stones are heavy and the shape is bad.]
;B[gc];W[fc]LB[fb:A][gd:B]C[this is a bad move. Try to avoid the empty triangle shape. If you want to answer, play at A or B.]
;B[bi]
(;W[ci]LB[eh:A]C[First you must play at A. This is an effective kikashi (forcing move). Then you must think of sacrifying your two stones, see the variation.]
;B[ah];W[dk];B[dl];W[en]LB[gj:A]C[in a fight, play from your weak group. It is a iron rule. Better play at A.]
;B[el]C[this black move is good.];W[eh];B[eg];W[fi];B[fh];W[ei]
C[look at your shape :(];B[gh];W[fk];B[ek];W[fj]LB[hj:A]C[this move is again too heavy, you make an other empty triangle. A seems better.]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[gm];W[fm]C[doesn't work, keep it for later.]
;B[gk];W[hl]LB[hi:A]C[A is better to try to save the white stones, but the game is lost now. Even if white escape, black will be
too strong in the upper right quarter.];B[gj];W[gn];B[hm];W[im]

;B[gi];W[kn];B[hk];W[il];B[qf]LB[pc:A]C[this black move is not good, there is still a lot of aji in the corner. A is better.]
;W[sh]LB[pb:A]C[A is bigger I think, white must try something here.]
;B[rj]C[not good];W[sj];B[rh];W[ri]LB[sf:A]C[just play at A, black can't cut you.]
;B[qi];W[si];B[sg];W[sk];B[qg];W[qc]LB[pb:A][ob:B]C[the invasion is difficult now. I still think A or B is better]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[re];B[rc];W[mc];B[md]LB[ke:A]C[A is more natural for black. Keep things simple.]

;W[pe];B[ne];W[ga];B[hc];W[la];B[ob];W[ha];B[kf]C[There is something you must learn from this game, it is to play lightly in difficult situations.  When you are in a hostile surrounding, don't make your stones too compact, it makes them easier  to attack and impossible for you to sacrifice.
Try to avoid bad shape too. When you are bound to make an empty triangle think twice. It can be a good
move, but it is rarely the case.

Have fun playing go :)])
