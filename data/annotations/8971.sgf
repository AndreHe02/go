AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi Rukis,

I'm Cookiex on kgs and I generally play at the 1kyu level. I haven't played in quite some time, but I'm sure I can give you a lot of tips and pointers that will improve your play. My strong suit is basics.... basics basics basics! It's all about the basics!
You can't build a house on a wonky foundation :-)

That being said, let's get into the game.];W[nc]C[Rukis [6k\]: ty glhf

(;B[kc]C[This is too aggressive.

When you're playing a handicap game against someone stronger than you, you should always assume that they are much better at reading than you are. Getting into a fight with someone stronger than you on equal grounds will most certainly lose you the fight.

Contrary to popular belief, doing a lot of fighting in handicap games will lose you the game more often than not. You need to consider your overall board position, and use your opponents moves to make a strong framework for yourself (see variation)]

LB[kc:B][lf:A]C[White has pushed black into a very heavy shape while making points at the top and influence in the middle. The 2 marked stones can be considered to be dead at this point in the game.]
;W[kb]C[White has to fix his shape, but it is worth it because he has made a solid amount of points and influence.]
;B[nf];W[mf];B[mg];W[ke]LB[lf:B][nf:A]C[Black has a lot of weakness in his shape at the cutting points A and B]
(;B[mh]C[This does not fix the cutting points at A and B (see variation)]
;W[ng];B[of]LB[lg:A]C[White prepares the weakness for black. There is still a cutting point at A]
;W[fq]
(;B[fo]C[This is playing in the wrong direction.
When choosing a joseki or fuseki, it is important that you do not play what YOU want, but that you play what the BOARD wants.

Right now, black has a lot of influence on the lower right side. This move pushes white into this lower right side, reducing the influence black has built up. (see variation)]
;W[nq]C[White has the freedom to steal the bottom area because black did not play at the bottom.]
(;B[lp]LB[fq:A]C[A high pincer is dangerous here for black because white has a stone at A that allows him to fight later.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[jp]LB[jp:B][lp:C][fq:A]C[the relation between A and B make the black stone at C very weak.]
;B[hp];W[lq]C[White can simply connect his stones.];B[kq];W[kp]
;B[jq];W[lo];B[lr];W[mp]LB[cq:A][fq:B]C[Whites shape is extremely strong, and there is still the invasion at A because of the stone at B]
;B[ip]C[Black must fix his shape, so white gets to destroy blacks influence with sente]
;W[dr]C[I'm going to stop the commentary here.

The biggest weakness that you must work on is your shapes! I'm going to continue through this game and mark every weakness in your shape, and show you 1 move that would not create a weak shape. And you will see white abusing most of the weaknesses in your shape.

I recommend reading a book on good shapes, and practise looking at your own shapes and identifying weaknesses by spotting where eyes will form and where cutting points are! This is one of the hardest things that you must learn to surpass the 5-4kyu barrier.

If there are any questions after this game, or you want a teaching game with me, you can contact me via email: jokerenting@gmail.com or on kgs via Cookiex on KGS.

I hope the little information I gave was useful to you.];B[cq]

(;W[fo];B[dn]LB[kq:A]C[White can't counter pincer at A because his shape is too weak and black made a wide pincer at J3 instead of a tight pincer at F3. This gives black more space to deal with the white move at A.

Therefore, white should establish a strong shape before fighting.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[hr];B[lq]LB[co:A][oq:B]C[Black has turned the area around A into points now. It will be very risky for  white to invade there.
Black has made the area around B very difficult to invade, this will turn into points later in the game.

Once again, white has gained only a minimal amount of points compared to black.]

[jn:A]TR[lf][lg][li][mk][ml][pp]C[Black does not need to get up close and personal with white. If black simply prevents white from escaping and cutting black into pieces he will create a VERY big wall that creates MASSIVE influence towards the A area.

White will have a hard time creating 2 eyes because of the stone at B.

If black reads carefully, he will be able to kill white here or at least minimalize the amount of points white will make. I estimate that even if the stone at B dies, white will gain only a maximum of 5 points in this area.

The area at A is worht much more than 5 points.]))
(;B[ng]LB[ja:2][ka:4][la:6][ma:8][jb:1][kb:3][lb:5][mb:7][mi:A]
TR[ob][gc][hc]C[By letting white connect under, you are giving yourself a really big influence around A. This is a good trade for black for several reasons.

1) The white shape is still very weak and can be exploited later in the game. If he wants to secure the points at the top he will need to add more moves. Black can reduce the points very easily there by placing some stones at the marked points when the endgame starts.

- Result: White may effectively get around 8 points in this area

2) Black has created a strong shape with influence towards the right side and bottom side. It will be very hard to invade this for white without sacrifising a lot of pionts.

In the end, black has gained more than he has given away.

The basics teach us that in the fuseki (opening stage) of the game, you must sketch your territory which you will fight for later. Fighting early will accelerate the game unnecessarily. Containing your enemy is more important than killing him.]
