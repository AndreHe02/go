AB[pd][dp];W[pq];B[qn]C[This is a new approach move for me.  I think the normal follow up is white R4, black R9?  I also know that black R3 can be a reasonable follow-up for black if white pincered...

All correct. It's just another move, nothing wrong with it in this position]
;W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[db]C[I know the end result from this side is that I'll have a low position that could be pressed down.  I was thinking that a long on the right possibly made a long extension on the top less valuable.  I'm not really sure if this is true or not.

Don't think so, but your choice isn't really bad];W[cc];B[ic]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[iq]C[this is an unusual move]
(;B[co];W[cn]C[c5 is not a terrible idea, but your followup was attacking the wrong group. top left is quite stable and c12 isnt completely forcing. d9 is the key point here]

(;B[ch];W[cj];B[eh];W[ej]C[white does not feel attacked here at all, instead it is black who feels apprehensive]
;B[cb];W[bh];B[cg]C[this move is happy for white. it would be better to just tenuki, and save the sharper play of either b13 or b11 for a later moment.]
;W[bg];B[df]
(;W[de];B[bf]C[of course, since white plyaed this way, this is promising for black]
;W[ce];B[bi];W[be];B[ah];W[af];B[ci]C[this is good enough for you for sure]
;W[cq];B[dq]C[you chose to play a little safer, i can't too strongly condemn this, especially since you have j3 to look forward to attacking]
;W[cp];B[do];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp]C[white seems to be stretching. he should be happy to play b7]

;B[ih];W[fd];B[gc]C[While I initially felt good about my invasion on the left, by this point, I was already regretting it.  white was now strong in the corner and I had a weak group on either side of white's weak group]
;W[hf]C[while the result was not fantastic for you, if you count the actual points things are not terrible yet. the main problem is fixing your center & bottom without giving white too much]

;B[ji];W[eq];B[es];W[ds];B[fr];W[im]C[I felt like white was being extremely kind to my weak group here

I agree! something like m10 would be much harsher];B[ki];W[li]
;B[lj];W[mi];B[mj];W[kj]C[i would have played the hanging connection as black, but i checked some variations and n10 seems to be an interesting way to resist white. this immediate cut is probably overplay]

(;B[ik];W[pj];B[il];W[jm];B[gl]C[I bet black can kill.  I may have been too greedy about poking out along the bottom.  White made life :(

white should indeed probably be dead here];W[gm];B[fm];W[fl]

;B[qk];W[pk]C[How should black follow up here?  I was torn between R8 and S10.  Neither felt particularly good to me.

its a bad shape place, since you probably should have settled before drawing out those four stones. s10 was ok as far as i can tell]

;B[rk];W[qm];B[gf]C[This started a bad exchange for me.  I probably should have left the area along or just played K16

;B[hb];W[id];B[jc];W[je];B[le];W[mf];B[rn];W[pn];B[kr]C[Now begins an interesting invasion.  I unfortunately had both time pressure and significant distractions during this fight :(  There may be some nice moves that I missed]
;W[jr];B[kq];W[jp];B[lp];W[lm];B[nr]C[I considered P2 in addition to this move.  I'm not sure how that would have worked out

probably both dead. quite is quite thick, hard to live here. catching s5 in gote for a large yose is pretty nice though]

it might be, yose is not my strong point :)];W[nl];B[hs];W[is]

(;B[dk]C[C12 is a nice followup move if you get time. otherwise, you focus on attaacking D6 (probably by leaning on j3)]

(;B[dk]C[I think the pincer at D9 is very playable immediately, as the vital attack point against d6. consdering he chose to play the unusual move at j3, this feels most miai. i am a little doubtful about the exchange of c5 for c6 before this attack being gainful (considering white might just ignore c5, for instance, and even in replying the c3 aji is still very much a great concern)]
