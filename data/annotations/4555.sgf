;B[pc]C[I played as black.  Thank you for your time and effort in reviewing this game :)

I think my biggest enquiries are around the running groups in this game.  How does one prevent making a running group? 

<vador> : basic answer : you can't :-) now you can prevent most of the bad feeling of having to manage running groups by taking care of them soon, that is, before it is too late (= cut from center freedom).

How does one run with a group?

<vador> : to the center, or, better, towards a lively or healthy group. And don't run if you don't think you can benefit from it.

Etcetera.  Still I think I did ok, but I'm sure a stronger player would have killed me.

<vador> : stronger players allways do :-) That's why they are stronger ;-)

Then I'm also just unsure about overplay at some positions - I indicated one place, but that's not really too important.

<vador> : don't expect professionnal judgement from me !

I think all these things would improve with time so I'm just actually looking for some general comments on my game.  I made some comments on my thinking and indicated some possible alternatives I considered during my own review of the game.

Thanks again for your time and effort :)];W[pp];B[pe];W[dc]
;B[dp];W[jc]C[That would probably have been my next move - extending from my corner enclosure.  But his corner is not yet that secure, so maybe the move from his perspective was not that good.  So my next move takes advantage of this...

<vador> : yeah, I think your way, but it doesn't mean K17 is bad. Just that you generally can't win on both sides.]
;B[de];W[cg]
(;B[ce]C[This response was incorrect.  But it turned out ok at least.  The usual response in that direction is B15...but maybe one of the other responses are better - more influence orientated.

<vador> : I saw this move somewhere. I think it's not THAT bad.]
;W[fd]C[He grabs some potential territory at the top.  Things are looking tight for my black group.

<vador> : you have plenty of ways to escape. The only trouble is, while you are only engaged to SAVE your stones, W can win influence/territory on both sides. Well, that's what he SHOULD have done.]
;B[dg]C[<vador> : good reaction]
(;W[ch];B[dh];W[dj];B[ci]C["Never allow a hane at the end of your stones"...even though the hane is now going downwards...  Think this was quite an ok move to make.

<vador> : "never follow proverbs you don't FULLY understand"... that's what I say to me ;-)

You're probably right about this move, but just because those two W stones look completly useless !]
;W[di];B[bi]C[Black looks stronger.  He has four liberties.  White only has three.  And white can't easily increase his liberties.]
;W[be]C[If my own black group wasn't so weak I could probably have blocked him at B16.  But then he can link up and have more liberties than my very weak black group.  Another alternative I haven't really considered but which can work is B14 - which acts as a mutual attack on B15 and B13.  B15 would never have been possible if I played C15 there.

<vador> : yes, but with B15 instead of C15 on the board, W reaction on D13 is probably not the same : C14 peep has to be taken into account.]

(;B[bh];W[bd];B[bf]C[I should have played this instead of B12 before.  It wouldn't have been necessary if I played B15.  So this is a move that could have been used better elsewhere (assuming correct move initially at B15) at for example one of the many points shown earlier.  So by this stage I have basically already made two redundant moves - B12 and B14 just because of incorrect play at C15 and not B15.

<vador> : don't forget the two useless W stones at C13 and C12. And the two floating ones at D11. The only good point for W here is his framework on the north, and at the NW corner.]
;W[cj]C[I still have more liberties.  No response is really necessary.  To extend to B10 would have been too small a point.]

(;B[qi]C[I make a big move.  I think an approach at R6 would have been better though since he would most likely not have pinched me.

<vador> : Wrong direction, I think. M17 looks better to me.]
;W[qk]C[Too aggressive for white...

<vador> : Considering the east situation, I think you're wrong. R9 is fine for me.]
;B[cm];W[bj]C[Still more liberties.  No response still necessary.  I can still play around F15 somewhere, but I think the moves indicated are better for now.

<vador> : why not an extension at K4 ?]
(;B[ei]C[I wanted to play E11 and say something like F15 to increase the influence of my (semi-) secure base.  Yet, maybe a better move right now would have been (since he can actually hane me there and I can still do something) - is to play an invasion at say R6 instead.]

(;W[ej];B[fi]C[He has a ladder breaker at K16 - and an atari if I push him the other way - so he could have cut me...but I think my black group is pretty secure since there seems to be something like a bent four (or something larger) forming there.  And his white group is still weak - so if he did cut then I could have made a hane at the end of his stones.]
;W[fp]TR[di][bj][cj][dj][ej]C[I don't feel comfortable pinching him now as I have now black stones in that direction.  I protect from a 3-3 invasion.

<vador> : let him have the corner, you take an attack on the marked stones. Who is better, do you think ?

Yet, I realize now - I immediately rejected the possibility of the pinch - yet a pinch in this position could have been good.  I mean I would have gotten a lot of pieces near D4 - and I would have had pieces on the other side as well - all of them now boxing in the white at F4 and B10...I should just have made sure that I don't get boxed in - would have been tight...maybe my response was safer.  Either way he has no secure base, but with the 3-3 invasion he could possibly have boxed me in. 

<vador> : you are wrong about this : if he makes a san-san invasion, HE is the one being sealed !

Maybe a low pinch to maybe play at H3 later...

<vador> : I think I would have played F5, no matter how bad it is on the lower side and SW corner. It is SO powerfull on the marked stones !]

(;B[dr];W[en]CR[cm][dp][dr]SQ[ej][qk][fp][pp]C[He doesn't grab territory.  For now I protect my own - as he still has no secure base.

<vador> : but now the D10 group is safe, and there is a W framework developping on the lower side.

Not secure, of course, but you have to deal with it, so it's not very satisfactory. And your corner stones are sealed in !]
;B[dn]C[<vador> : Look for a way out instead !];W[jq]
(;B[qn]C[The move I could have played instead of E11.  Also - I don't want to give him a base at F4 - should maybe have played H3 and put some real pressure on white there.

ALl this is very narrowish ! The white stones on the lower side are quite safe, I think ! And R6 could come under great pressure.]
;W[qo]C[I don't want him to form a half-eye (tiger's claw?), and in this position I can't afford to get boxed in.  I play Q6.

<vador> : what is a tiger claw ? What do you mean by this ? Q6 is quite automatic !]
;B[pn];W[qg]C[I want to retain my territory.  I play Q13.

<vador> : advice : R13 is NOT your territory. At most, it is one of your spheres of influence. Seeing it as your territory will drive you to play in a lot of wrong directions.

At go, nothing is fixed unitl the endgame, sometimes later. You have to be flexible and willing to EXCHANGE some of your influence for something elsewhere. Or, of course, fight to keep what you have invested in, if this is your best interest !]
;B[pg];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[qf];W[og];B[pf]
(;W[rg]TR[pn][qn]SQ[og][ph][ej][en][fp][pp][jq]C[I need to respond or possibly end up with too few liberties.  A very aggressive alternative could have been R10.  Q10 is too aggressive.

<vador> : This is THE W mistake ! The W plan is very good (I think) here ! Look on the outside ! The two marked stones are HELPLESS, and the W moyo being formed occupies a QUARTER of the board !

S13 is horrible, because another move could have changed the WHOLE path of the game. It's a wasted stone. You were lucy here.]

(;B[rh];W[qj];B[rj]C[I consider R13 dead.];W[rk];B[rf];W[nk]
C[Not sure what that was.  That cutting point at Q10 has a ladder breaker.  Maybe an attack on R6.

<vador> : and a potential HUGE territory !!!!!];B[nn]C[<vador> : just about time !!!]
;W[np];B[em]C[I want to extend that base to the center.  I am not too worried by R6 right now - even though it looks tight.  Also if I can follow this move up with say F10...

<vador> : fortunatly, the situation is not that bad for you at R6, that is, not as bad as what it is for W at D10. E7 is quite a good move, because it isolate the D10 group. Remove the big W group from the board, and you'll see what is at stake here. This is how you should consider E7 so good.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[gn];B[eo]C[I couldn't extend to F5.];W[fo];B[fl]
;W[gm];B[fj]C[D10 is dead.  There's still enough space for eyes - but not really anything I'll allow...]
;W[fk];B[gk]
(;W[el])
(;W[dl];B[bl]C[Question: Was this overplay.  I don't think so.  Well I guess it was.  I don't think he would have been able to form eyes in any case - but I played it just to be sure.]
;W[ek];B[lc]C[He can cut me of from my influence - making the influence insecure - but he is basically dead at D10, so I grab a big point.  And I'm a bit worried about the influence he has towards the center - with myself also having a running group there...

<vador> : W is loosing D10 quite surely, but look at what he has gained with is wall at G6. It is not so healthy, but R6 and friends look more and more isolated.

Don't let yourself be disturbed by regions of the board where nothing happens. The NE group is COMPLETLY SAFE, and F8 has to be protected !]

(;W[gj]C[I see his plan and play G8.

<vador> : yeah ! but imagine W playing G8 himself !];B[gl];W[dm]
;B[en];W[el];B[hj]C[I put G10 in a unfavourable ladder.];W[cn]
;B[co];W[bn];B[bo];W[hk]C[No reason to capture G10 now....I want to increase my influence in that region.  Maybe in hindsight it wasn't that smart to let G8 get disconnected.  What do you think?  It was quite a struggle to have it alive in the end.

<vador> : you're completly right, my friend :-)

Ok but ouch - I actually needed to capture G10 as you will seen now.  I think this is where my troubles started.

<vador> : maybe a bit sooner ! M17 effect ;-) It is just useless, even for the ladder (now broken by H9).]
;B[hl];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi]C[He escapes my ladder.  And now G8 is weak.  P6 is also weak.  Surrounded by white influence.

<vador> : I warned you :-)];B[ik];W[hh]C[In hindsight I should have sacrificed G12 - its only one point and played J11.  Or a connection move between my two groups e.g L7 area.]

(;B[fh];W[gg]C[I need to respond.  He can capture all my stones there if I don't.]
;B[fg];W[gf];B[ff]C[<vador> : now this one is useless ! Time to handle H8 and O6 !]
;W[jn]C[Large moyo for white at the bottom.  And maybe in the top center as well - since my influence there isn't secure.

<vador> : WHAT influence ????? You don't have any ! just a running unsecure group !!!]
;B[lo];W[il];B[jl];W[im]C[He can ladder H8.  I need to respond.

<vador> : ladder doesn't work, but you definitly need to respond :-)]
;B[kk];W[lm]C[Now I am in trouble.

<vador> : now you see it :-) This is called a cut. W has two targets, you have none. I'd like to be W now :-)]
;B[lq]C[Question: What do you think of the game so far.  I don't think my game is that bad - its just these lose groups that trouble me.  How could I have played differently since a stronger player would most likely have killed both my groups there - and maybe using a eye stealing fuseji my D4 group as well...

<vador> : unless you play against a dan player, D4 group is a stronghold ! Just as Q17 one.

What you lack mainly is the ability to look on different directions. Don't just consider your side. Fear large frameworks, isolated and unsettled stones. When W pushes you ang gives you some territory, look on the over side to see if some other place on the board is not reinforced by W moves. Don't expect him to give you territory for free (well, he does, sometimes !). Consider the game globally. You can gain a lot from this.

Forget about fine arts, tesujis and other black magic. Just focus on the flow of the game. Play, encouter situations, and analyze them with your opponent and stronger players (well, stronger than me, I mean ;-) There are rooms on KGS dedicated to this.

THEN, and then only, come back to theoretical study. I can tell a lot about this to you, because my beginings were all theoretical, and I have now lots of problems to improve !]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[jj];B[jk];W[lj];B[kj];W[ki]C[I went for a double atari at M11 in the hope of playing at K11.  Alternatively I could maybe have tried something at J11 or K11.  But its mostly stabs in the dark hoping the opponent would make a mistake.

<vador> : yeah, you are being driven into W's plan.]
(;B[li];W[ji]C[He sees what I'm planning :)];B[mj]C[I am basically just clutching at straws here.  I should never have gotten that group disconnected.  But in hindsigh I recall I was quite focused on getting it connected to my other group - while at a certain point I could probably still have justed killed B10.  I got a bit too focused at this point maybe.

<vador> : sure. Still, there is Q6 to think about ! And D10 is not so easy to get off the board.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[km];B[kl];W[om]C[Seems that black has gotten connected...  Though not yet secure.  Yet I have a possible attack on the corner etcetera.]
;B[ln];W[jm];B[jo];W[io];B[jp]C[I am making an aggressive attack on the G6 group - at the moment feeling at ease with my liberties.  P6 is important for me - overlooked the importance of it.

<vador> : now it is far less important. W is not threatening to build something big anymore.]
;W[ip];B[gr];W[iq];B[gp];W[kp];B[ko];W[mo];B[mn];W[lp];B[hm]
C[In hindsight.  P6 gives me a load more liberties.  L3 is also important - but too early to play now as M3 is too small to withstand a concentrated attack at this stage.  I want to now crawl to H6 - killing one of his groups, but he sees what I'm planning.  I should have cut at G5 BEFORE doing this maybe - but it turned out ok all the same.]
;W[go];B[hn];W[in];B[ho];W[ep];B[do];W[gq];B[hp]C[I consider F4 dead with correct play.

<vador> : I think you're right. W is loosing his time here. H3 is better for him, giving him the entire south border.]

;W[np]C[I'm not too worried about these recaptures of his.  His white group at K3 doesn't have that many liberties.]
;B[nr]C[He resigns.

<vador> : my global view : things went complicated at the end, because the combat was confused, and very borderline. Sooner, it was more a strategic battle. You could have gone very bad strategically and tactically. But your opponent made a few big mistakes.

Look back at the game, try to see it from a few meters, allowing it to flow globally. You'll certainly see it from a new point of view.]

By chasing the two marked stones (even without capturing them), W can develope a huge territory, while you can't do more than defend. So you'll end up breathless, and W will be able to attack somewhere else, make more territory...]
