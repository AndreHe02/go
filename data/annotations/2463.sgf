C[Hi.

In this game, I was playing as black. I came out with a clear lead after fuseki, so I just tried to make a sure victory. But maybe, because of that I played too conservatively. Also, as yose is my weakest skill, I ended by losing by 4.5 pts. I'll make some comments during the game, butI'd like any ideas and comments you can make.

Thanks

PS: BTW, I'll start my comments with pajaro

Hi, I'm reviewing your game.  I think that overall you played a good game but you played a couple slack moves at key points.  This allowed your opponent to take the key points and catch up.  Also, you played a good reducing move that lead to a weak group at a time there were big gote moves.  I think it would have been better to reduce in sente and take one of the gote moves (K2 for instance) than the bigger gote reduction.

Any questions, just ask

Corrin];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dd];B[ep]C[pajaro: Classical fuseki, I think.
--
yes];W[dn];B[hp];W[cj];B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic]C[H16 more popular, but this is fine.]
;W[qn];B[qk]C[O4 was also ok];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nr]C[O3 was joseki for white, O2 is normally used if w doens't want to exchange s4 and weaken Q6.]
;B[cq]C[Reducing the influence of O2 is very big, I would have taken gote here personally]
;W[bq];B[dq];W[bo];B[qd]C[pajaro: Up to here, white has a corner and a potential side, though black can still invade at C8, C12 or reduce at E10, for example. Black has little profit but a good position along the other sides. So I take R16 to prevent a white invasion. I think black is ok.
--

Yes, b is good.  You still have quite big weaknesses at the top around n17, and it is a big pity not to seal off O2 with N3 or similar.  I would have done that instead of R16 I think.]
;W[nc]C[pajaro: That's what black wants. Now I have a target to attack and turn my moyo into cash.
--
right];B[lc]C[I would have attached first];W[ne];B[pg];W[ld]
;B[kc];W[ng];B[pi];W[ni]C[Worth thinking quite a bit here. I think you are ahead on the board and you have sente, so a good move here should wrap up the game.  

P9 is tempting, as is P17.  Something around K3 is also nice for sealing the bottom left.

Apart from helping black you can weaken white.  F6, F14 are both good.  E10 also has potential.

I think I would be mostly deciding between P9 and F6, and would probably go with F6.]
;B[ok]C[Fair enough];W[pb]C[This is big, but I'd ignore it to get F6 now.]
;B[qb];W[ob];B[mb]C[This is too small];W[cb];B[eb]C[pajaro: Is this a mistake? I guess yes. This is the typical yose sente that weak players like me always answer instead of getting sente. My upper side is in no danger, so I don't really need to asnwer. What can I do instead? Attac the white group? O reduce the left side?
--
Yes, this is certainly a mistake. I think you must either attack the white group or else your N18 move is shown to be a big mistake too.  That means a move around N9, forcing white through the center where J17 will reduce the effectiveness of white's moyo.  Then when you shoulder hit at N3, you should get a nice bottom right.

Alternative you accept N18 as a mistake and play F6.

-- 

After reviewing the game, this move cost you the game.  The key points on the board are sealing off N3 and reducing with F6.  By playing here you allowed white to get both of them.]
;W[fn]C[pajaro: This is point I'd like to have played before.
--
right];B[hn];W[kq]C[Ouch again.  This move is a disaster.  You can no longer block off O3, plus white can reduce with H2 to get over 10 points of what was black's.]
;B[di]C[pajaro: I reduced because the bottom side will be small. White is low and black is high there, son I expect a big reduction. Also, white has a big yose hane in C2 to make my territory even smaller. So, this time I say "you harm me, I harm you". So, I reduce...
--
Fair enough. I'm not sure about your choice of point.  W G5 threatens to kill if b responds H5 so b has to respond j3 or similar.  That means H6 is not well connected.

I think this move is the wrong point though because it is going to get heavy too fast.  How about F10, W D12, H8 or similar?  Note that J2 is getting quite big now.]
;W[dj]
(;B[ei];W[ci];B[ej]C[pajaro: Too slow? I played it to ensure a good base to jump, as this black group can become heavy. White is getting strong.
--
Any think you do here will result in this.  You must play with jumps to avoid it.  I'm not happy with the shoulder hit, but this seems a fairly logical continuation.]
;W[dg]C[I would play H8 here, and be willing to give up E10.]
;B[hj];W[kg];B[mk];W[kj];B[el];W[cl];B[kl]C[I still think you're ahead, but your lead is falling as white reduces your moyo and L3 becomes the key stone.]
;W[hm];B[in];W[gm];B[im]C[I'm not sure about this, I would have played H12 instead.]
;W[il];B[jl]C[I don't like this because it looks too easy for white to really attack H10 etc.]

--
Yes, you have the chance to win in the midgame but after D11 etc got heavy you had to allow L3 and even H2!  I think if you had reduced from H7 etc instead then w would have got slighly more around F10 but you would have bot all the territory to say M3 and been a good 10-20 points ahead.]
