C[Hi thanks for taking the time to review my game. I am playing black and although I ended up dying a miserable death in this game. I felt I had the upper hand at times and ultimately failed at pressing my advantage. I had chances to kill 4 different groups but couldn't. I know I need work on that. But also in a lot of areas as well.

Elvard: Hi there,
usually you don't have to kill anything to win a game. Weak groups (which you'd like to kill) are something like negative points. You can attack then, steal their bases, chase them while you are making your own territory or build up strength.

So, first principle is, you should attack to:
 1. Get territory
 2. Get strength (thicness, influence)

If you are strong nearby and you are pretty sure, what are you doing, you can try to kill enemy group. But it's very risky and usually you end with your own weak groups...]

;W[fd];B[fq];W[dq]C[This seemed odd, but I wasn't entirely sure what to do, I figured C10 was solid but maybe I should have approached closer? or would that allow him to pincer my weak F3 stone?

Elvard: F3 is weak, but so as D3 group. D3 move is usually slack in this position.]

;B[qr];W[rq];B[rm]C[I'm not strong at invading... I think I should attack at S6 here? White has 3 weak groups but I'm uncertain at how to punish

Elvard:
Don't try to kill it so if you don't know how. It's better to keep this "unsetled" groups as ko threats.]

This game was especially frustrating because I felt I let every opportunity slip through my fingers and couldn't capitalize on his mistakes while he was able to make me pay for mine.

Elvard: Indeed, too many mistakes. Next time, try to attack calmly. By putting too much pressure you are making yourself weak.]

It doesn't matter that you are not going to kill anything. More important is be strong everywhere.

By the way, try to count (I know it's too early, just try it):
White:
Lower left - 12
Upper left - 15

Black:
Upper right - 11
Lower right - 9
Two groups with two space extension - 8

W has 27, Black has 28, so white is leading by komi. But black has 1 "weak" stone (well, it's not weak at all, yet) while white has 3 weak groups... This is very important and much bigger difference that 6.5pt]
