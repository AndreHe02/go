AB[pd][dp]C[Dear Reviewer-
I'm playing black as a 9k on KGS with 2 stone handicap and got soundly beat.  I would appreciate if you could tell me where I went wrong.

Thanks for taking the time to look over this game for me.  I felt like I was doing okay during the game and the next thing I know, I'm behind by forty points.  In retrospect I have found what I think are a few major blunders.  I would appreciate any help you could give me.  Thanks.

Barry

All my (the reviewers) comments are preceded by the tag [orionsky\] to indicate it is me writing. Most of the time I will comment on blacks moves but occasionally make some remarks on white's moves as well.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[cn];W[iq]LB[dr:a][cq:b][jp:c]C[[orionsky\]:
In even games, this move is usually played after the W a (d2), B b (c3) exchange since then the W group would be more solid. Now B can some time play at a and attack while securing territory. Thus, and to ensure a better efficiency, W usually plays at at c (k4).]
;B[qn];W[pn]LB[ql:a]C[[orionsky\]:
This is not very consistent with the W move before. This one is aiming at influence while the one before aimed at immediate stability. W should rather use his stability to pincer B around a (r8).]
;B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[qk]LB[qj:a][jp:b]C[[orionsky\]:
This move is a overly cautious, joseki is at a. Nevertheless B is now settled and can aim at the excellent reduction point at b (k4).]
;W[om];B[pl];W[fc]LB[po:a][oo:b][op:c]C[[orionsky\]:
Since B connected his cut in the LR corner tightly, W sooner or later has to do so as well. As it stands B has the severe cut B a (q5), W b (p5), B c (p4) to aim at.]
;B[df];W[ic];B[dj];W[fj]C[[orionsky\]:
Strange. What is the idea with this move?];B[kc]LB[db:a]C[I think that this was a mistake because I extended to far, but did not really attack anything.  Perhaps g15 or o17.  I'm really not sure what the best strategy is at this point.

[orionsky\]:
This move is good. If W negelects to defend at a (f17), B has a perect attack there. Since B is strong on the upper side of the board, he need not fear a white invasion there.]
;W[nc]LB[pf:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Overplay. If B simply plays at a (q15), W has no good continuation. The lone black stone ends up between two weak W groups. A rule of thumb: "A weak group between two other weak groups is a strong group!"]
;B[md]C[[orionsky\]:
Too easy for W.];W[nd];B[ne]LB[me:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Tough. If W cuts at a (n15), matters would become very difficult for both sides.]
;W[mc]C[[orionsky\]:
Submissive.];B[ld];W[oe];B[od];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[of];W[rc]
;B[rd];W[pc];B[qd]C[I don't believe the result was bad though.  I was able to build some strenght and seal white in.

[orionsky\]:
Right.];W[rb]C[[orionsky\]:
At this stage B should probably take territory at a (d18) and after W defended his group reduce the W bottom moyo at b (k4). This seems the best way to use his magnificent influence.]
;B[lp]C[Maybe I should have moved n14 instead to finish off my wall

[orionsky\]:
There is no need to invest another move in the wall. If W cuts, he is the one in trouble.
This move should rather be at a (k4) as indicated before. a is a standard reducing move which perfectly fits here. The move which were actually played is danger of being severly attacked and even be shut in.]
;W[ln];B[jo]C[[orionsky\]:
You should not use a knight's move if you are to run. Rather use kosumi (diagonal move) or ikken-tobi (one point jump) since they are more stable. In this position a move at a (k4) would be particularly good.]
;W[fo]C[[orionsky\]:
B now has difficulties to fix his shape. Maybe cutting at a (q5) immediately is best.]

(;B[oq]C[[orionsky\]:
Aji keshi (loss of potential). Another rule of thumb: "Don't peep where you can cut!" This move only strengthens W.]
;W[op];B[nq];W[kq]C[[orionsky\]:
B position is ruined.];B[lq];W[pq]
(;B[pr];W[qr];B[os];W[kr];B[kp]C[m2 instead?

[orionsky\]:
No. Getting out is most important.];W[mr]C[[orionsky\]:
B must intercept (see var).]
(;B[jm];W[mq]C[[orionsky\]:
W got much better off than he should.];B[fm]LB[jk:a]C[[orionsky\]:
Hm? This move is not connected to the running group, is it? Better run at a (k9).]
;W[hm];B[hn];W[gm];B[gn];W[fn];B[im];W[hk];B[mn];W[mp];B[lm]
;W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[eq];W[fr];B[ml];W[me]C[now I pay for not sealing this wall off...

[orionsky\]:
B need not be afraid, his lower group is out of the worst so he can fight confidently in his sphere of influence.]
;B[nf];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[le];W[mf];B[kg];W[lh];B[ki]C[Another mistake.  I think that I should have kept this wall solid and moved at k12.  White would have had a hard time living

[orionsky\]:
Right. This is a serious mistake but B still can attack the W group.]

Bad (see previous var).];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg];B[rg];W[pf];B[pe]
;W[rf];B[re];W[qe];B[sf];W[rh];B[qf];W[qi];B[og];W[ph];B[sg]
C[[orionsky\]:
Why this move? The B group is alive anyway. Now its much more important to get the first move on the outside.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ig];B[if];W[hf];B[hg]C[[orionsky\]:
Better keep this atari in reserve. The next B move works without it, so it is better style not to play atari at once.]
;W[ih];B[he];W[gf];B[ge];W[fe];B[ff];W[gg];B[fd];W[ie];B[id]
;W[je]C[[orionsky\]:
B has to give away some stones.]
(;B[ke];W[jd]C[[orionsky\]:
Game over.];B[hh];W[ii]C[[orionsky\]:
I tried quite a lot of variations to save B's nine stones on the top but B always lost by one liberty. The sequences are quite long and difficult and there are many possibilities to make a fatal mistake. The one that seemed most promising for B is shown in the variation.]

(;B[fg];W[gh];B[fh];W[hi];B[hd]C[Perhaps g17 instead?

[orionsky\]:
Yes, but it is too late anyway.];W[hc]C[[orionsky\]:
Better capture at once so W cannot force B again.];B[gd];W[gc]
