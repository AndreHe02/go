AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[This is a game I played with a 3k while he was slumming it, I guess. The first few moves he passes to let me place further handicap, and then proceeds to trounce me mightily. Through most of the game he seems, from my point of view, to be beating me with magic.soneca [1k\]: Hello, my name is Bernardo and I'll review this game, any further questions PM me on KGS. =)]

soneca [1k\]: those groups are dead already
soneca [1k\]: and the square is almost dead
soneca [1k\]: You make some mistakes over and over, you need to think in a strategy when playing. Sometimes you can't save all, but even losing a group you can get profit. Go is about using strategy to beat your oponent for 1 point, is not about kill and surive.
