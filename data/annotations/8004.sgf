Dear reviewer

Please review for both sides.

The following game was a study game on DGS, and my opponent and I decided to put down our thoughts as to why we played each move so that we could both learn from each other's play.

We decided before the game that we would play a diagonal fuseki. I, playing black, have very seldom played diagonal fuseki, and I struggled to find a good strategy. White outplayed me, but would also appreciate your comments, as this was a study game.

Please comment on our moves where you see fit, and also if you see any weaknesses in our reasoning.

Many thanks in advance.
Mark (Saurus)

==

I will prefix my comments with == (as shown).

It was a very good idea to test out fuseki like you guys did in this game.

The first thing you should do is jump to the end of this game and read my comments there before going through the review itself (but it's ok if you go about it some other way). In any case, the comments at the end of the game deal with the opening phase.

Try to remember that your stone must be as efficient as possible. A player who gives 2 purposes to his moves will always win against a player who only gives 1 purpose to his moves.

The rest of the review deals with local and global considerations that are not linked to the diagonal fuseki.]

Oh man! This is joseki repeating at its finest!

Black is thinking locally (the corner), but should be thinking globally (the framework).]
;W[qq];B[kq];W[fp]C[Stefan: Difficult situation. I want to invade your area before you can make solid territory, but after a low approach at f3 you get a comfortable situation with f4 and so on. So I play the high move. If you play d6 or so I get a solid base with j3, else I can get something on the left.

Difficult situation always arise when you favor a local variation that is not globally compatible.]

The L3 stone is badly placed. It doesn't put pressure on White F4.]

Black's corner stones have now been shut in, this is bad. Even if they later become connected to the center, white still gained way too much from this sequence.

What you guys identified earlier as an overconcentrated position has now become a very nice thick position for white. White's influence will control the flow of the game.]
;B[nh];W[oe];B[nm]TR[nh][oh][qj]SQ[no]C[==

This is bad shape.

Shape is a very important concept in go but I can't go deeply into such considerations in this review.

The important thing to observe is that, at the end of the game, these stones are not connected (the R10 stone got cut off).

White can split Black on a large scale through the hole at O5.

I will not hear any justification for this move. Bad Shape! Accept it!

[nm];W[fg]LB[kq:A]TR[nm][nn][no][op][nq][pq][pr]C[Stefan: Nice wall there. However, I like my moyo more as the g4 region seems pretty settled.

==

Black's wall is fairly useless at this point (unacceptable since Black could have killed White in the corner). The A stone is way too close.

Plus it was gote for Black and it let's white take the most important move on the board.

Perhaps Black can still try to attack the G4 group to gain somthing in the center, but since White is already in the center, it won't be as profitable.]
(;B[dh]LB[fg:A][dh:B]C[Saurus: Safety first...   :)

==

The exchange of A for B is better for White.];W[io]C[Stefan: Yep ^^

==

Hard to attack White to gain profit now. So Black's wall is not so great.

Try to make walls in front of large empty space, then play as far as you can away form it.

Don't make walls in front of solid groups.]

Check out the modification, then read what is here.

A is the wrong place to be. It's an end game move. We are still in the middle game!!!

Let's look at the shapes: White's shape is impeccable. Black's shape is bad with cutting points everywhere.

This is unfortunate. This bad shape is the one that gives control of the game to white.]
;W[ec];B[bm]C[Saurus: I believe that at this point, the game was already lost for black. I have two big weaknesses - the center and the left. I decided that the left was bigger...

Saurus: I am almost certain that a white invasion around here would live, so much as it pains me to do this, I think it is necessary. Unfortunately, it means you will get ahead on points, so I will have to try and catch up in yose.]

;B[ij]C[Saurus: Yes, it was a difficult decision, but I tried to estimate how many points I would have after each variation, and this way came up 4 points better than saving the two stones. it's hard to say, because the l8 area can still be reduced a little...]

You can exchange the smaller part of the corner for sente to block the other mokey jump.]

This is not a complication. Seems more like a reckless attempt to kill White (but White cannot be killed here).]

[oh:B]TR[qj][pk][ql]C[==

===============
Center (continued):
===============

I think it's safe to say that A and B are considered the first center stones played by each player.

White A was used to secure the upper side and center.

Black B was used only to connect the upper right stones to the center stones at the cost of R10 which is one of the most important stones black played.

What you should be seeing is that White was more efficient with his stones than Black and this is why White won.]

C[Saurus: Thanks and congrats!

Result: W+Resign

==

Alright, so this is the end result that started from the diagonal fuseki (stones numbered).

Here are questions you can ask yourself at the end of every game you play, which I will try to answer for this specific game:

Considering corners:

1. Who controls which corner?
2. Given an answer to 1, who played first in each corner?
3. Given an answer to 2, did the player correcly use the first stone played in the respective corner?

Considering sides:

1. Who controls which side?
2. Given an answer to 1, who played first on each side?
3. Given an answer to 2, did the player correcly use the first stone played in the respective side?

Considering the center:

1. Who controls the center?
2. Given an answer to 1, who played in the center?
3. Given an answer to 2, did the players correctly used their center stones.

=======
Corners:
=======

* Upper right corner (move 1):

As we can see, the upper right corner is controlled by black and he played there first, so this is natural.

We can conclude that the stone was used correctly during the game.

* Lower right corner (move 2):

White played first, but doesn't control the corner. This is not bad, as white got a piece of the right side instead (with black stones in it which is a nice bonus).

We can conclude that the stone was used correctly during the game.

* Lower left corner (move 3):

Black played first, but doesn't control the corner. He doesn't control either side of the corner, so his stones were not used correctly. Instead, stone #3 (which is supposed to be one of the most important stones of the game) serves only to link the 2 stones below it to a center group.

We can conclude that this stone was't used correctly during the game (and this gives us a hint as to how white outplayed black).

* Upper left corner (move 4):

White played first, he controls the corner and the side. A very good result. So the move is correct.

If you do this type of analysis for all your games, then you will be a better player than me in no time!

=====
Sides:
=====

* Left Side (move A):

Black has 12 points on the side. Given his intial framework on the side, this is not a great result.

* Upper Side (move B):

White controls this side all the way up to the center... (with a corner too). This is a great result.

* Lower Side (move C):

Black controls a small part, but all the way up to the center, so it's a great result.

* Right Side (move D):

Black is dead after playing the first move on this side... I don't want to say that the first stone you play must absolutely be alive, but if you lose it, please make sure you get compensation elsewhere on the board. In this game, Black got no compensation for the loss of D, and this reflects the fact that he lost.

======
Center:
======

White and Black have about the same type of control of the center, but because white played better in the sides and corners, we can say that White made better use of his center stones than Black.

Move one step back for my explanation of the center.])

Let White play here instead of the game move.];B[bb]SQ[ob]C[--

If Black's move really was sente, then it would be better for black to play at B18 then to respond to P18.

This begs the questions: is Black's move really sente? Are all variations of the monkey jump necessarily sente? These questions are way to deep for an answer here.

But it seems to be a example of a monkey jump that is not completely sente (that is the final parts aren't worth it yet, they will be bigger at a later part of the game).]
