C[Hi pretorium, I'm LST and I'll be reviewing your game. I reviewed mainly for black, but there are also some comments on white's moves when I felt they deserved attention. My comments will be prefixed with [LST\].

This was a nice game, and I thought that in the opening black had quite a good position. However, in the middle game white was able to get some big and solid territory confortably, and managed to reduce black quite a lot, leading to his victory.

I believe most of the problems in the game were due to reading mistakes, so this is one area you should train. One of the best ways to train your reading ability is by solving Go problems (tsumegos). Some people find them boring, but they're an invaluable training tool.

My second advice would be to keep playing! At 15k, you'll improve a lot just by playing.

I hope my considerations will help you better your game.

Now, without further ado, let's go!]FG[259:]PM[2];B[qd];W[dp]
;B[qo]C[[LST\] This 5-3 (mokuhazushi) opening is a little bit unusual.]
;W[dd]
(;B[oc]C[[LST\] This is a nice enclosure that protects the corner and aims to develop the right side of the board.]

(;W[lc]C[[LST\] Now this is unusual. White usually aproaches on the other side to reduce black's influence, which is directed to the right side of the board. See the variation.]

(;B[qj]C[[LST\] This is fine, but maybe the high play at Q10 would be more balanced in this situation because R5 is low.]
;W[gd]
(;B[pq]C[[LST\] Now black's formation on the right side of the board is nice and very strong. Black has two corners and white still doesn't have any solid territory. I'd say black's prospects are really good at this moment.]

(;W[mq]C[[LST\] White played too close to your strong group.]

(;B[kp]C[[LST\] Pincering the N3 stone is a good idea, it's punishing white for playing too close to your strength, although maybe L3 would be better because it leaves less options for white (see the variation).]
;W[kq]
(;B[jp]C[[LST\] This is too passive, it lets white settle easily. I think this was one of the main mistakes in this game.]
;W[jq]C[[LST\] White is happy with this development.];B[ip]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[mp];W[fp];B[fo];W[ep]C[[LST\] Suddenly white has a very big amd strong area at the bottom. On the other hand, black has a lot of strength towards the center, but I think white got the best of this trade.]
;B[cj]C[[LST\] This is good, you managed to play in the last open big point in the board.]
;W[cg];B[cm];W[cn];B[dn];W[co];B[bm];W[bi];B[bj];W[ci];B[jj]
C[[LST\] This is not a bad move, but you have to keep in mind that it's hard to enclose territory in the center.]
;W[le];B[oi]C[[LST\] This is a nice move, it enlarges and starts to consolidate black's territory.]

(;W[gh]C[[LST\] White was too passive here. See the variations.]
;B[gj];W[dm]
(;B[em]C[[LST\] This atari damages your stones on the left side, I believe the other side would have been better.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[en];B[bn];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[dk];W[el];B[gl]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[fj]C[[LST\] I think black managed the situation here well, keeping most of his center territory.]
;B[dj];W[gi];B[jg];W[je];B[cc]C[After this, my game became a tactical mess. How could I refute tactical attacks following and escape the mistakes I made?
Finally, what can I do amout my middle game?

[LST\] This move has the right idea, it's the time to invade white's big - but still open - corner.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[db]C[I enede up being killed. How could I avoid this?

[LST\] See the comments in the following moves.];W[bd]C[[LST\] With this move, the B15 stone is already captured. You shouldn't try to save it.]

(;B[ad]C[[LST\] This is the wrong direction. B15 is already captured, so this only helps white.]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[eb];B[de]C[[LST\] This was nice, black's corner group could still have been saved.]
;W[ae]
(;B[ed]C[[LST\] This atari actually helped white. Always try to predict the next following moves your opponent will play. See the variation.]
;W[ec];B[fc]TR[fd][ee]C[[LST\] This leaves a lot of cutting points for white to exploit.]
;W[ee];B[fb]C[[LST\] Don't play atari just because you can. This isn't accomplishing much, besides forcing white to play moves that he would play anyway.]
;W[ea];B[fa];W[fd];B[da];W[df];B[mg];W[nf];B[og];W[of];B[pf]
;W[mf];B[hf]TR[lg][ng][pg]C[[LST\] This aims to reduce white's territory, but black's walls around O13 are still very thin. White could've pushed through now.]
;W[gf];B[hg];W[gg];B[hi];W[lg]C[And here the push that finished me started... How could I refute it?

[LST\] It's hard to stop white from entering your territory because black's wall is very thin. In these situations, you should try to play solidly, without leaving cutting points and weaknesses behind.]

(;B[lh]TR[ng][pg][mh]C[[LST\] This hane leaves many cutting points behind. You shouldn't leave these weaknesses when trying to protect an area.]
;W[ng];B[mh];W[nh];B[ni];W[oh];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[pj]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[qg];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[pe];B[qe]
;W[pd];B[pc];W[nd]C[[LST\] White was very successful in reducing black's territory, but I think the game is still close.]

(;B[mj]C[[LST\] I don't think this was necessary, black's already very strong on this region.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[rb];W[ob]

(;B[pa]C[[LST\] This wasn't necessary.];W[se];B[qa];W[nc];B[sd]

(;B[in];W[go];B[ho];W[gn];B[il];W[hj]
(;B[ij];W[hh];B[ii];W[ih];B[jh];W[ko];B[kn];W[jm]C[[LST\] This was a tricky move. Always keep track of your groups's liberties (or lack thereof) and try to predict how your opponent might be trying to exploit your weaknesses.]

(;B[km];W[im]
(;B[hl]C[[LST\] Black chose to save the H7 stone, but it would have been better to sacrifice it and save the J4 group instead.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[io]C[[LST\] This was a big loss for black, and the game is definitely decided.]
;B[jl]C[[LST\] Capturing this group wasn't urgent.];W[mo];B[ln]
;W[op];B[no];W[pp];B[qp];W[qq]
