AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[WOG:  

Thanks for submitting the game!  I racked my brain trying to figure out the tsumego in the upper left, but leave it to better minds to figure out.  Nonetheless, there's still a lot to learn from here.

I have a number of suggestions in general for White:

Rule 1. Can't play normal, even game, Go!
Antithesis Rule:  Play stranger, less obvious moves

Rule 2.  Can't be so slow
Antithesis Rule: Leave the slow move for later.  Trust in Black's weakness to not see the incompleteness of the move.

Rule 3.  Don't resolve everything for Black.  You're being too obvious in what you're attacking and what you're doing.  Be coy.  Be sly.  Be cagey.  Don't be "Hey, over here, I am attacking you now!"
Antithesis Rule: Lean, then attack.  Make Black make a choice.

Rule 4.  You have to trust Black will make mistakes.  Be patient
Antithesis Rule:  You have to change up the order of standard moves and variations.  You create mistakes for Black by introducing things Black hasn't seen before.  Don't stick to pat moves.

That is, you must play partial josekis, fast moves with light shape, but, more important, you have to be indirect about your aims!

If Black makes no mistakes, then the handicap is wrong ;)

When Black just takes territory, make a giant moyo.  Black can't protect everywhere.

When I play White, I try to NEVER trick move.  Sometimes probe aggressively ;) but try not to trick.

Go is a game of taut and slack.  Slack moves, like some problem books, are moves that are less than 100% correct.  Maybe 50%, maybe 75%.  White's job is to eat up the slack left by Black.  You'll see more of this in the review

The top complaint for your style against Black - YOU'RE BEING TOO DIRECT!  BE INDIRECT!]
;W[gd];B[jc]C[WOG: Already, Black is making mistakes... how to capitalize?]
;W[cf]C[WOG: Good.  When Black goes away from a threat, either point at it or mix it up]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[ce]
(;B[ec]C[WOG: Tewari under this variation];W[fd]C[How do you feel about this move?

WOG: Bad :)   Remember the rule from before... Be indirect.  This move says, please fill in this gaping hole in your position.  While it's observing the other rule - "Don't play normal" - this move smacks of a trick instead.

This is a slack move by White.  Maybe 50%]
(;B[cd]C[WOG: Interesting!  This shows tewari why your move is bad.  See earlier variation]
;W[de]C[WOG:  This isn't working]
(;B[eg]C[WOG: Wow!  Black let you off the hook!  In some ways, Black has done you a disservice by rewarding your strange play at f16.  Ouch!]
;W[ee]C[WOG: Now that bad move by White earlier (50%) becomes a 150% move in combination with this connection!   This is the benefit of playing non-normally... of course, I found the move at f16 abnormal, as opposed to good-not-normally... subtle difference]
;B[jp]C[WOG: Good tenuki];W[eh]C[Perhaps I should have focused on the bottom side more?

WOG: Yes, taking the three stones is too slow.  Now, Black has atoned for his mistake in the corner with two free moves!

Slack move by White - 50%]
(;B[bd]C[WOG: Slow for Black, you get the move back :)   Black thought the corner would die if not reinforced???]
;W[cn]C[WOG: There's a big board out there... You have nine stones on one side...]
;B[fq]C[WOG: Take an assessment at this point.  What is Black doing?  Playing very very conservative.  To beat this Black player, you need to make Black uncomfortable by getting Black out of Black's conservatism.]
;W[nc];B[je]C[WOG: Black is showing signs of a target :)];W[fb]
;B[eb]
(;W[jg]C[I think the next few moves were questionable.

WOG: Right, this is a bit questionable... Better to leave this and start on the corner first  IMHO.   Still, the idea is right, but you need to be indirect with your moves.  This move, like many of your moves, proclaims loudly "I AM ATTACKING YOU!"  See variations]
(;B[md]C[WOG: Interesting idea by Black, but maybe o15 is better]
;W[nd];B[pf]C[WOG: Black seems a bit schizophrenic... why not play here from the start?]
;W[me];B[le]
(;W[lf]C[WOG: Covering is usually good.  Is this the best way?]
(;B[mf]C[WOG: Why must Black always atari...];W[ne];B[kf];W[lg]
;B[kg]
(;W[ld]C[WOG:  Don't atari first!  Atari-ing compels Black to fix things.]
;B[ke];W[kh];B[lh];W[mg];B[mh];W[ng];B[jh];W[ki];B[ig];W[ji]
;B[ih]
(;W[ii]C[Was this the best idea for white?

WOG:  It's great locally, but you have a lot of ground you have to make up for.  75%   See other possibilities considering this is a handicap game]
(;B[hb]C[WOG: Black prefers not to live small or just connect]
(;W[gb]C[WOG: You're being obvious.  Try not to be obvious. If Black wants to connect in gote, let Black.  If you had two moves against this group, could you kill it?  Maybe.  Therefore, raise a ko somewhere else.   Don't resolve everything so soon.]
(;B[lb]C[WOG: Black sees your moves White.  Black says, "If White is playing here, then I must follow."  Usually to the demise of Black.  However, you have to be more surreptitious in your moves.  When White is obvious, Black wins.]
;W[hi]C[WOG: This isn't an even game... an even slower move... still directly pointing at a potential target...]
;B[mc]C[WOG: Black responds.  Black can play six slow moves in a six stone handicap game.  Don't point them out to Black!]
;W[mb];B[lc]
(;W[el]C[WOG: This is OK, but still a big board out there.  See variation.

Also, you need to anticipate what to do with d7.]
(;B[qc]C[WOG: Submissive, but OK idea.  White still not alive.]
;W[ph]C[Maybe the bottom side needed invading.

WOG: No.  The group above is still cut and needs to live.  

Yes, White shouldn't always plays correct and sure, but Black can take advantage of White lapses.

This move here, however, is strange in that it neither connects or kills... Black just got through playing at r17, so the corner is only threatened in Black's mind.]
(;B[qh]C[WOG: Black can't help but help you :)]
(;W[qg]C[WOG: Is this right?]
(;B[pg]C[WOG: Black lets you off the hook];W[qi]
(;B[rh]C[WOG: Black likes to miss the opportunity to hurt White :)]
;W[pi];B[ri];W[qj]C[WOG: White covers for the gap (although aji abounds) and Black makes small territory... just like a handicap game]
;B[dm]C[I was not sure how to react to this stone.

WOG: Then don't play at e8 ;), play at f7

The rule for a circumstance when you don't know what to play, is to play away from there.  Try the corner]
(;W[dn];B[em];W[en];B[fm];W[fn];B[fk]
(;W[gm]C[WOG: Can you guess my comment?  Too direct];B[dl]C[WOG: Black responds to "I AM GOING TO KILL YOU" with "I WILL PROTECT MY STONES"]
(;W[gl]C[WOG: Direct, direct, direct...];B[fl];W[bk]C[WOG:  [Start Melodrama Routine\]

(;W[ek]C[I wanted to eliminate at least one of Black's eyes.

WOG: Unreasonable!  Try not to do things directly against Black!  Sure, if it kills, it kills, but if it doesn't, you're in more hurt than before

[melodrama continues\]

"YOU'RE POTENTIAL FOR TWO EYES IS GONE!"];B[dh]C[WOG: Oopsy!]
(;W[cg]C[I was thinking about D11 as well. What do you think?

WOG: D11 would have been my first thought...  But there's a hellalot to think about with d11... some ideas below.]
;B[fh]C[WOG: Don't follow Black]
(;W[ei]C[WOG: White is following Black now??];B[fi];W[di];B[ci]
C[WOG: Game over];W[ch];B[ej];W[dh];B[gg]C[The result was too good for Black, I think.

WOG: Correct!  White can resign now]
(;W[cj]C[This was probably too small.

WOG: White's not alive??   Hard to say.  There may be enough pressure on the upper corner by White to eek out life.  Not sure.  My tsumego is weak... consult a good tsumego-er... too much for me to read :)

Nonetheless, Black is ahead in points... Doesn't need the big kill to win by resignation :)]
(;B[cp]C[Black started playing very defensively from here on; how could I have complicated matters a bit more?

WOG: Got to start earlier :)  Also, now would be a good time to play a big move endgame that threatens the corner]
(;W[hq];B[jq]
(;W[gp]C[WOG: You have to do more than save your stones at this point]
;B[qq]C[It seemed as if Black knew she was ahead.

WOG: This is bold for Black.  Not quite connecting the stones]
;W[np]C[WOG: Good.  Threaten];B[qm]C[Interesting]
(;W[om]C[Was this the right way?

WOG: White has a lot of ground to catch up so threatening the big moyo is good, but so is just eating the two side stones... 

This move tries to eat too much IMHO];B[mq]C[WOG: Hard to kill]
