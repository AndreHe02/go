C[durandal(W)-steinb79(B) on IGS, we are probably both around 23k.

This was a close win for me (W), but I feel I should have done more invasions. Generally in my games there tend to be one or two large regions. Somehow I don't find the right time and place for invasions. I would greatly appreciate any comments on when and where to start invasions in black's moyo.]

C[I think this was too far for a pincer. It should have been at A to exert more pressure on the marked stone.

A would be ok so would be X];B[pn];W[oq];B[cn];W[dn];B[cp]LB[co:A]
C[I didn't expect that. Should I have played at A now?

yes];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[dm]MA[cm]C[here is the problem: had you cut at A previously you wolud either get a big corner or sente play at X]
;W[en];B[em];W[fn];B[gm];W[hn]MA[fm]LB[co:a][iq:b]C[Should I have invaded somewhere now? How should I attack the stones on the 4-4 points?

basiclaly you need to begin to worry about the moyo at upper left.  cut at X offers some promise because of  weakness at  a.

however something bigger would be better at this time.
I would probably either tenuki or took ground at  b.

please notice that black c takes away most of what you aim to have on the bottom side]

I dont know :)
  I would personally start off more traditionally with X];B[pi]

;B[jc]MA[ph][gl][cf]C[Is there a good way to play at the top now? Or is it already too late?


If you ask such a question just count to see the rough score estimate.

If you need to attack - prepare backup then atack

try a few sente manouvers like X to see the result black cant ignore any of them and you will have support for your invasion]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gl];B[gk];W[gn]C[ajki keshi - VERY BIG LOSS

you gained a few points and lost all the potential there.
if you plan invasion DO NOT strengthen black walls.

playing X move I marked previously in this area would leave at worst some stones on the outsied to connet to to get extra liberties etc.

now there is na such possibility.];B[lk];W[mk]C[let him connect that stone - it is a few points. there are muchbigger moves on the board]
;B[ll];W[mm];B[rj]C[good black move];W[rk];B[qh]C[another X  possibility gone ...]
;W[ik];B[ij];W[hj];B[ek];W[jj];B[ii];W[lj];B[jk];W[kj];B[il]
C[This turned out to be a bad move for black. Had he let gone of the 7 stones, I wouldn't have been able to push into his moyo so far.]

you shouldnt he will simply extend to h18]
