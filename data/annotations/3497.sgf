[bn][cn][en][ao][co][bp][cp][aq][mq][lr][ks][ms]C[I was told that i got really lucky in this game. I think thats true. The move I made @ 03( i think). Almost secured the game for me. Any comments and variations would be helpful, thank you.

P3 was the move. Actually it was a mistake by white to play P4. Both black and white played too much with a local view and were missing whole board vision. Both of you should avoid playing too close when attacking or invading. Try to read a little to see if a move is really necessary. Don't be afraid to sacrifice one or more stones. Black did this really well in the beginning. Also try to count liberties when you're in close combat. Advice: 1) Look for the biggest move, corners first! 2) Healthy groups. 3) Attack when opponents groups are not healthy.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
