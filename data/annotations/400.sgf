;B[qd];W[dc];B[cp];W[oq];B[oc];W[pj];B[qp];W[pn]LB[qn:A]C[EE: a) is an alternative. It might be better, based on my comment for move #14, but it is hard to say for sure, of course.]
;B[pq]C[NM: I was pleased that he let me link my stones, resolsing the weakness of the taisha.]
;W[op];B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[mq]LB[hq:A][fq:B]C[NM: Should I have played tenuki rather than N3?

EE: N3 is the kind of move you more often are sorry you omitted than sorry you played. It makes a strong and clean shape so it is unconceivable that it could be wrong. Besides, proper moves are rare enough in kyu players' games, that I feel it would be almost a pedagogic crime to advise against such a move. :-)

Of course, now Black can play a) or b) to reduce the effect of the white wall, but that's the price you'll have to pay if you insist on playing taisha (which often gives a white wall facing left) in this kind of position.]
;B[rn]LB[ro:A]C[EE: Forestalls a white move at a), but not as urgent as the moves shown in the comment to the last move, in my opinion.]
;W[ep]C[EE: Very good!];B[gq]
(;W[cq]C[NM: I thought the wall I could expect to come out of this joseki with would be useful on the L side.  Would it have been better to go say F5 or E2 to put more pressure on the G3 stone?

EE: Yes, I regard both those moves are far better than this tsuke.];B[dq]
;W[dp];B[eq]C[EE: We see that Black will get completely settled right in front of the thickness you just had created. Then it will be hard to use that thickness for attack. Thus this joseki was not well suited for this particular position.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[fr];B[cr];W[bq];B[er];W[co];B[br]C[NM: A mistake, since it removed the possibility for him later of playing E5.

EE: According to Ishida, this move is "possible". Maybe not here though, if White makes the correct reply.]

(;W[bp]LB[gp:A]C[Ishida: "submissive and shows a lack of fighting spirit". (!)]
;B[gr]LB[gp:A]C[EE: Ishida gives a) instead. Black can thus economise on the move on the 2nd line, since White don't have B2 in sente anymore. This would be quite a good result for Black, locally as well as globally.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[qf]MA[rn]C[NM: Was this good, or should I have gone say D12?

EE: This was bad, since the right side has an open skirt. Left side is clearly biggest.]
;B[de];W[dh]C[EE: Good!]
(;B[cc]MA[dh]C[EE: This is not joseki, since the marked stone serves to make Black heavy.]
;W[cb];B[ec]C[NM: A non-standard move, but I'm not sure if mine was a good refutation.

EE: Maybe my variation is playable.]
(;W[dd]C[EE: Ends in bad shape after Black's next move, but when the cut it aims for works, it is often the strongest move.]
;B[ed];W[ee];B[cd];W[db];B[bb];W[eb];B[fb];W[ce];B[df];W[ef];B[cf];W[be]
;B[eg];W[gd]LB[fe:A]C[EE: It's a pity this doesn't break the ladder. Maybe the ugly move of a) works? Keeping Black separated would mean success for White.]
;B[fc];W[bc]C[NM: I couldn't let him take my 5 stones, but I don't seem to have come out of this much better than him. Was there a better sequence?

EE: This would be great if it weren't for that wretched ladder!];B[ff];W
[bf];B[fe]C[EE: Black is very thick, so it is fair to say that he is leading now.]
;W[cg]LB[nd:A]C[NM: I thought of M17, but C13 also seemed big, giving me a secure L side (so I thought)

EE: White must do something at the top. a) seems like a natural choice. Your move M17 is also possible - hard to say what would follow then.]
;B[ke]LB[nd:A]C[EE: Strange... a bit loose. I think this just makes a) an even better move for White.]
;W[oe]C[NM: His top was very big, so I felt I had to reduce it.  Would it have been better to play say L17 and try and live inside?

EE: This is too shallow, I think. It also helps Black to enclose a large top. L17 seems dangerous.]
;B[md]C[EE: Very big! The variation tries to show a little of the aji there is left.]

(;W[fi]C[NM: Was this too hopeful?  Would E10 or D9 have been better?

EE: Black is ahead, so White needs to be ambitious. When Black invades, White's influence on the right can be transferred into cash.]
;B[ei]C[NM: Seemed to me an overplay, but it didn't work out like that.]
;W[eh];B[fj];W[gh];B[dk];W[cl]C[NM: If I didn't defend he would take the  whole side]
;B[fl];W[gj];B[hl]C[EE: Black plays lightly in White's  stronghold.]
(;W[hn]C[NM: I could affore to let him cut at F6

EE: Yes, but the question you should ask yourself is: "Do I have any use for a stone at H6?"
(I think you can guess my answer :-))];B[go];W[gn]C[

 robin 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[jl];W[gm]C[NM: Trying to protect my F6 cutting point in sente. After G7, he could take the F6 stone but not cut effectively.

EE: Please spare me the sorrow sight! :-o Peeps are usually made when they contribute to *good* shape. Whatever tactical motives you find for this move you should really think twice before playing like that... :-) This could also be taken as evidence that there was something wrong about H6 earlier.]
;B[gl]LB[gk:A]C[EE: Black should play at a) of course, to really rub it in! :-)]
;W[jn]LB[ll:A]C[EE: A question to ponder: Where will you make territory from the attack? You are driving him right into your only remaining area with potential for expansion. There is just too much space to have the slightest hope of killing him. He has no other weak groups on the board. When he lives big in the center, you have no points there. And K6 is not likely to help to surround any area of importance. Stop him head on (a) and you will at least get something.]
;B[ij];W[jd]C[NM: I wanted to use the threat to live on the side as a means to penetrate it, while continuing the atta!
 ck on the F8 group.

EE: You are clearly behind, so I guess you have to try something like this.]

 Niall 5k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[ig];B[hh];W[hg];B[gg]LB[ji:A]C[EE: Black is trying too hard. Simply a) to make shape.]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[ji];W[gi];B[ii]C[EE: Nice squeeze!];W[ki]C[NM: I reckoned he couldn't afford to cut at L12 or he'd lose the F8 group when I played J9.]
;B[ik];W[kg];B[kj];W[li];B[ll];W[mk]C[EE: Finally you attack from the right direction!]
;B[lk];W[jq]LB[ro:A][qo:B][rm:C]C[NM: If I kept on pushing him (say L7) I'd push him into my moyo.

EE: Both players are very strong here, so this area is uninteresting. I would try to block off the right side. a-b-c perhaps?]
;B[km];W[ge];B[gc];W[ql]C[NM: Purely territorial, but it seemed big to me.  Now I wanted to play C9, but I had to reply to his kikashi.]
;B[mf];W[ng];B[re];W[rf];B[rl];W[rk];B[qm];W[pl];B[nf];W[og];B[ck]C[NM: Damn!]
;W[pc]C[NM: This was a bit too hopeful a push, but I was sure I was losing now, so I had to try something.]

 Niall 5k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[qo]C[NM: Well, the invasion at the top hadn't gained me anything, but since he was solid before it hadn't lost me much either.]

;W[os];B[sk];W[rj]C[EE: Black's error costed him almost 15 points. The game is suddenly pretty even!]
;B[po];W[oo]LB[bl:A]C[NM: Another mistake, played without thinking! I should have gone P6.

EE: Yes, but note that Black later reduces more than 6 points in sente, starting with a), due to the remaining aji of b). Therefore, it seems better to defend thickly at b). I suppose you hoped that Black would answer your move at c)?]

(;W[jf]LB[ie:A][mp:B][lr:C]C[NM: probably not the biggest move, only gaining me 1 point in gote... but there aren't many big moves left.

EE: It is a little bigger than 1 point, since you have the follow-up at a). And it is reverse sente, since you will answer a Black move here to stay connected and get 2 points for G13 and F12. But the biggest move is b): 2.5 points in reverse sente, since Black would threaten c) if he played b).

But White can't win unless he gets help from the opponent - see alternative for this move!]
