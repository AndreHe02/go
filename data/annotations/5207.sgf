C[Greetings,

My name is Zoran, and 8k at KGS.  In this game (White) I tried to play openly, paying more attention to shape than territory.  I've made some obvious blunders which I annotated in this file, and some not-so-obvious (to me, at least) for which I will rely on your judgement.

I would appreciate some comments on fuseki and direction of play, and also any other area that you percieve that I am especially weak at.


Thanks in advance,
Zoran

hi Zoran,
it is an interesting game, in which you showed good fighting spirit and good judgement. Go on like this, and you will get stronger soon.
I gave some comments on style and technique in the game. Also, I added some variations in order to illustrate alternative ideas (not necessarily better ones).

Hope you enjoy the variations like I enjoyed studying your game.

best regards,
Christian (prana).];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[ip]C[Zoran: I don't know any two-point high josekis.  I just played it like this hoping that I will be able to get a light shape along the bottom.]
;B[dn];W[eo];B[cq];W[cp]C[Zoran: I chose to block this way because I already have a stone at J4.]
;B[dq];W[en]LB[go:B][gp:A]TR[dn][ip]C[prana: looks a bit heavy. I would prefer A or B.
It strengthens the white marked stone, and aims at attacking the marked black stone at a big scale.]
;B[qo];W[lq];B[dl];W[em];B[df];W[dh]C[prana: difficult variation. Playing just at f16 looks normal to me. Of course this is a matter of style.
But it might also indicate that blacks development on the left side is superior to whites.]

Thus it is unfortunately aji keshi.];B[db];W[ib]C[prana: in general, this is bad style because you eliminate the cut. After the connection your stone is too close to the black wall.]
;B[hb];W[id];B[ic];W[jc];B[hd];W[ie];B[qi]C[prana: black has a solid lead in territory.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]C[Black is ahead and I don't really have that much thickness; I must resort to invading before it is too late.
prana: I agree, that black is ahead. But the upper right group is already sure territory. It is already too late for invading there.]

(;B[rg];W[pr]C[Zoran: I'm not sure about this one.  Is it correct to attack Black's shimari at this point and, if so, how?

But what about the left black group? How can he live after white A9?]
