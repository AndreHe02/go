C[Dear Reviewer,

Please review this game for me (black). I made one nice tesuji, but generally I think I was severely outplayed.

I would appreciate help both in my attempts to fight; whether I should have avoided the fights I got into or if I just missed the right fighting moves.

Also, if you could show me where I made mistakes in the opening and early middle game.

Hello,

I will do my best to help you out with your questions.

- Velirun (1d)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[po];B[qo];W[ce]
;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[cc];B[df];W[qn]C[Velirun:  White should, of course, have jumped out at C13 to finish the joseki.  However, lower left is likely more urgent at this point.]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]
(;B[eb]C[I thought this was a very big move, making my group save rather than weak. But perhaps there were bigger moves?

Velirun: It's not really a matter of big - you want white surrounded.  The only way to do that is C14, and that is what you should have played.  See variation.]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[dh];B[cf]C[I think probably E13 would have been a better response, leaving me with more aji.

Velirun:  It is almost never correct to push into a shape like this, unless it is a ko threat or you can cut one side off.  Always save it!  I would have gone with D13 here, myself.]
;W[bf];B[dg];W[ch];B[ei];W[dj];B[jd]C[At this point I think I am ahead a little.

Velirun:  You should have extended one more line away - L16.  Your wall is large.  And I believe you are behind by a little - you have a large framework, but you've given white a lot of settled territory.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[Velirun: The normal strategy is to attack with P17.  See variation.]
;W[ne];B[pc]C[Velirun:  Ouch!  Really bad move!  You have such glaring weakness at R14...]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[qf]C[What is my best move in this situation? I felt I needed to separate his groups.

Velirun:  Difficult position you're in... he hit you right on the spot.  I would peep at P16, then attach at Q14 in hopes of splitting and attacking.]

(;B[of]C[but this move doesn't work, because this stone could easily have been caught in a ladder.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[pf];B[qe]C[I don't think I can safely play P13 like I would like to.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[me]C[I think W would have been better off taking my cutting stone. Do you agree?

Velirun:  I can't imagine why he didn't take it.];B[og];W[ph]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[lg];W[ke];B[lf]C[I think this was a mistake, and ended up making W thicker without helping me much. Would K15 or maybe N11 be better?]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[ig];B[md]C[This is the tesuji which I saw and don't think W saw.

Velirun:  These two stones don't matter right now.  You should be attacking on a grander scale while securing your center group.]
;W[le];B[nd];W[ji]C[Is there a way to rescue my stones here? Or would I be better playing tenuki and trying to use their influence later?

Velirun:  A quick count indicates you can't give these stones up, and you can't give white many more points while he attacks them.  I would say the game is almost over.]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[lj];W[kh];B[li];W[lh]C[I think with O11 I could probably rescue all but the two stone group, although it would still be hard. Instead I played N12, which was a mistake.]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[ni]C[throwing good stones after bad];W[mj];B[lk]
;W[nj]C[finally I read out that the inner stones are lost and try to gain thickness in exchange for them.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[nk];W[nh];B[mk];W[mg];B[gq]C[This move I made by looking for an aesthetic placement. Is there a better choice?]
;W[jj];B[jl];W[mo];B[lp];W[lo];B[ko]C[I think this is a mistake. Probably L4 is correct, taking some territory below before moving to rescue the stones in the center.]
;W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[kp];W[jm];B[in];W[km];B[kl];W[im];B[il]
;W[hn]C[I should have sacrificed these two stones, but then maybe I would have lost the game anyway on points.

Velirun:  This is true.];B[io];W[ho];B[ip];W[hl]C[Now I think I have lost this game and the rest of this game is just my death throes]
