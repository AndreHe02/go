C[T3282: Hi!

J: Thank you for reviewing my game. I feel that I am still a vey new player and would be thankful for any notes you can add.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[fq]
(;W[dm]MA[cm]LB[cn:A][dn:B]C[J: Too pasive? should i have played at the marked spot instead?

D7 is not close enough to limit black in the corner, and is also too loosely connected to D4 to allow white to attack black.  The spot you marked is playable, but A or B are more normal.]
;B[co]C[J: This felt agressive, and I believe i fended it off well. Thoughts on the following moves?]
;W[do]C[This is fine.  Black played an odd move and this 1) preserves white's connection 2) keeps black separated.]
;B[cq]
(;W[cp];B[dq];W[bp];B[bq]C[This sequence feels like it is soft on black.  Black takes a decent sized corner and has good access to the outside.  White has good potential on the left, though, so it's not bad.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc]
(;W[mc]MA[ne]C[I played this stone anticipating the parked play, which he never made.

White does need to protect the cut at O17, but can also consider a couple other moves.  This move is perfectly playable, however.]
;B[ph]
(;W[qk]C[If invading was the best move, did i pick a good spot to invade?

This is not ideal, because black can play to simultaneously attack that stone and make a corner enclosure, as shown as a variation for the next move. 

This is a fairly critical point, as the game is turning from the fuseki to the middle game.  It's important to consider the balance of areas and groups at this point.  Black and White seem relatively equal, but black has a little more settled territory in the bottom left.  All four sides are still fairly open, and the top left and bottom right corners are both relatively alone.  Since all four sides are open, you can probably assume that you will get two and your opponent will get two, regardless of who takes one first.  For the corners, on the other hand, the approach to a 3-4 stone is more urgent than the 4-4 stone, so this is where white should look.  See variations for other options.]
(;B[pm];W[rh];B[qg];W[rg];B[rf];W[ok];B[nm];W[rn]MA[rm]C[This was a miss click. i meant to play the marcked spot.

This doesn't quite work.  The marked play would be fine, I think.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[pj];W[pk];B[rm];W[rl];B[sm];W[sn];B[qn];W[ro]
C[Here, these stones are already dead, so it's better to take sente and tenuki.

Without black's followup move, there is still aji in the corner, so white might be able to exploit it later.]
;B[qp];W[sl];B[qm];W[kq]C[I think this move might be too deep.  It does live, but black gets a nice wall in exchange.  I'm not entirely certain about this judgement, though.  I might have tried something like G4, F5, or even G6, on the border of two moyos (always a big point).

That said, it's definitely the right idea, as white should do something about black's potential on the bottom, and once white lives there, black has no potential for large expansive territories anymore.]
;B[iq];W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[jr];B[ir];W[jq]
;B[jp]
(;W[or];B[np]
(;W[pr]C[See variation.];B[qr]
(;W[mf]C[Was this a bad play?

This is exactly the right idea.  It expands white's prospects on the top, and limits black's on the left.  My only quibble is that I might play on the other side instead, as shown in the variation, because black is stronger on the bottom and has more prospects for territory there.]
;B[fc];W[hc]C[Good!  White is making use of the thickness on the right to play a severe pincer.  Black should probably just take the corner with C17.]
;B[fe]
(;W[dg]C[As mentioned before, this is too loose.  To attack black more securely, see the variation.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[cb]
(;W[bc];B[dj];W[ck]C[In most circumstances,  this is not a good move, because it is playing into a position where black is already giving white a shoulder hit.  I'm not entirely certain what white should do, however.  Black's stone is quite problematic.]
;B[cj];W[bk]
(;B[bj];W[bh];B[ep]C[This is a mistake by black.];W[he]C[A good idea, but it does induce black's next move.]
;B[df]C[Is there a was i could have captured this stone?

This goes back to the weakness of the 2 space jump.  I don't see an easy way to capture it.]
;W[cf];B[de];W[ce];B[ed]
(;W[gg]C[This move is the right idea, limiting black, but maybe in the wrong spot.  See the variation.  There is also aji at E14 that white could use now or later.]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ke]C[This is quite ambitious for black.  White does kill the invasion, which is good.  The key is to try and use the strength white builds from killing the invasion to bully black's two other weak groups, at f15 and c10.]

;B[lb];W[gb]C[This tenuki is good for white here.  Black's last move was basically a pass.]
;B[fb];W[ml];B[mm];W[ll];B[lm]
(;W[km]C[This hane is ambitious.  Before playing a complicated move like this, it's a good idea to estimate who is ahead.

Without any centre territory for white, I count 80 points, give or take a few.  I only see about 65 points on the board for black.

To catch up, black needs to create complications, which means that white should play as solidly as possible to maintain the lead, while still playing strong moves.]
;B[kl];W[jl];B[kk];W[jm];B[nl];W[mk];B[nk];W[mj];B[nj]
(;W[mi]MA[jk]C[K9 instead?

K9 is quite playable.];B[jk]
(;W[ik]C[This hane is also dangerous.  White's three stones are close to a lot of black strength, so white needs to take care of them and play solidly.  As long as the white stones all live, black should not be able to live with the three stones at L9.]

;B[ip];W[ho];B[hp];W[ln];B[mn];W[lo]C[This move is not ideal, because black has a big sente squeeze he can apply.]
(;B[mo];W[kn];B[qa];W[pa];B[dh];W[ch];B[eg];W[mb]C[I see now that I made a very silly move...

Yes, there's no need to worry about white's stones being cut off because of the black group in atari.  I'm pretty sure a white move on A15 prevents the seki.]
;B[cg];W[bg];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bf];B[be];W[ah];B[bi]C[After this, I count about 62 points + 5 prisoners for white, and around 80 or so for black, so white needs to find some big endgame moves or make complications to win.]
;W[kb]C[This move, however, has the feel of a pass.  White doesn't need to worry about those black stones, so he is taking gote to reduce his own territory.]

If black invades, it is probably best to lean on the invasion to attack black's floating center group.

If black runs into the center, one of the first moves should be d17, to secure the corner and take black's eyespace on the side.]
