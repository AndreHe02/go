C[Hello,

it would be kind if I could any advice or comment on any part of this game.

The game was played not so long ago on the KGS server. I played with the black stones, so it would be great to get some comment on these moves. Here and there I added some comment myself, what i was thinking and so on.

Well, I hope you enjoy the review,
thanks,

(;B[or]C[Olaf: without any support of white stones around, P4 seems possible.]
;W[op];B[nq];W[no]
(;B[mr]C[Not sure about N2.

Olaf: N5 seems possible, but leads to a fight. In a fight the white starpoints looks good. On the other hand its black who has the more stable groups, so a fight isn't bad for black.]
;W[mo];B[on];W[oo];B[ok];W[pl];B[pk];W[ol];B[pf]C[Olaf: playing in front of your wall seems a little bit overconcentrated to me. It would be a good move, if your wall becomes weakend by white (by moves as R8 or O8, O9), but for now, the wall is very stong. So if you want to play around this corner, O16 looks better. Another possibility would be F17 or K16. My choice would be C6 here. It puts a little problem on white. The standard answer around F3 would be the wrong direction, because the black group in the lower right corner. A hazami around c8, would leave the corner open for attack.]
;W[og];B[qh];W[nk];B[nj]C[Olaf: the interesting part of the board has clearly switched to the left now, so both players should think about tenuki here.]

;W[fg];B[di];W[dl];B[fh]C[F12 was meant to be an attack on the white group, but it looks a bit .... slow ?

Olaf: an attack from an unstable group?. F12 isn't a bad move, but i would look at it more as a possibility to make your group more stable in the white moyo. :-)]

;B[dr];W[fq];B[eq];W[ep];B[fp];W[er];B[eo]C[wanted to invade the white moyo. Don't know really of this is a good idea.
Olaf: The idea of erasing the moyo isnt bad, but perhaps you should look at the other maneuvres to do so? There are gaps around the bottom and starting whit the hane at M9. So perhaps the white moyo isnt as big as it looks first.]
;W[eq]
(;B[go]C[Olaf: a haevy move. If you are playing inside of a strong enemy area, look for something to abandon. In this situation, abandon your 2 stones at D5-E5.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[io];W[kp]C[Olaf: if whit is successfull (and black has no eyes an), how many points will white get now? The point for black is, that the stones around D5 are much more a burden now as in the variation. :-)]

;B[gc];W[hd];B[hb];W[ib];B[pc]C[Olaf: btw. The group around D5 isn't definitly alife (if i see it correctly), so a move around there seems to be necessary after you invented so much in it.]
