(;B[dd]C[Per: Until now both sides have played normal moves, but D16 is not so good. When white answers at D17 black has to few liberties.
The normal move is B17 (go back and see variation).];W[dc];B[ee]
;W[fe];B[bc];W[de];B[ef];W[bd];B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bb];B[fd]
;W[ec];B[gd]C[Per: White has a safe corner and black is fighting a difficult fight. This is the result of the black move at D16.
White now has to choose between G15 or F14. See variation.]

(;W[ic]C[Per: I don't understand the purpose of this move. If black captures with G14 the two weak groups is now one strong wall.]
;B[ie]C[Per: As mentioned before this should be at G14];W[kd]
;B[mc]C[Per: Good move. It makes territorie and attacks at the same time.]
;W[lc];B[md]C[I think the exchange is bad for the White.

Per: You are right.];W[kf];B[ig];W[bf];B[cg];W[hf];B[if];W[ff]
;B[fg]C[Per: This is an overplay. Black has to play E13. See variation for white's counter moves.]

(;W[gg]C[Per: Oops. White has to play E13 first.];B[gf]C[Per: Good reading by black]
;W[ge];B[he];W[fh];B[eg];W[gh];B[gf]C[Per: The game is going to be very difficult for white now.]
;W[qf]C[Per: In this situation black should keep white seperated and use the strong positions to fight.
See variation for one way to start an attack.]
(;B[pf]C[p14 is better, I think.

Per: Maybe, but the important thing is that you are playing in the right direction and keep white seperated.]
;W[pg];B[of];W[og];B[qe]C[Per: Black should keep attacking white with O13]
;W[rf];B[re]
(;W[qh];B[hc]C[Per: This is not important white can't connect here. Go back and see variations.]
;W[ib];B[mb];W[kh]C[Per: This is a very big move for white !!!]

;B[kq];W[ir];B[jq];W[iq];B[is]C[Per: This is a small endgame move. Moves like D3 and B13 are both much bigger endgame moves.
But a move around O7 is most important now.];W[hs];B[js];W[hq]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[cr];W[dr];B[on]C[I think p7 is better.

Per: P7 would be to thin.White could cut you and start a fight. O7 is another possibility.]
;W[om];B[bg];W[mm];B[pm];W[pn];B[lg];W[kg];B[mh]C[bad move.

Per: In the local context O13 would be better];W[nf];B[le];W[lf]
;B[mf];W[ne];B[me];W[ng];B[ke]C[of course n13, connect

Per: Capturing the white stones at the top is worth close to 20 points and you can still reduce white with moves like L10 and O7.  I believe L15 is the best move.]
;W[mg];B[hb]C[Per: F18 is worth more points.];W[od];B[oc];W[pe]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[qd];W[gk];B[gm];W[hl];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj];W[gj]
;B[di];W[nn]C[Per: White now has 3 weaknesses black should take advantage of.  1. M12
2. H7
3. J10 or K10

By them self they are not dangerous, but in combination one feals that something should be possible for black.
Let's try some variations.]
