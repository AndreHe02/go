AB[pd][dp]C[Hi Alexsander, 

I hope I can answer your questions. Enjoy the review!

Timm];W[nf]C[why did white start? I thought black always started

As you are the weaker player (25k vs. 23k) you get two extra stones, which are placed in the corner. So you already "started" with two moves, which are done for you.

My english is not very good, so I copied this from Wikipedia:

Handicaps are given by allowing the weaker player to take Black, and declaring White's first few moves as mandatory "pass" moves. In practice, this means that Black's first move is to place a set number of stones (usually the number is equal to the difference in the players' ranks) on the board before allowing White to play. Traditionally, the hoshi ("star points") -- strategically-important intersections marked with small dots -- are used to place these handicap stones.]

(;B[oe]C[tried to block off territory in the upper-left corner

do you think this was effective?

No. Always try to play from the corners to the sides to the centre. The reason is, that it is much easier to get points in the corner as in the centre.]

You shouldn't attack if it is not necessary (for example to save a group). In this case you have a weaker position, as with every white move you lose one liberty and your opponent is always one move in front.]

;B[fm]LB[fm:A][gm:B]C[again, how do you battle out an attachment?

Even if your opponent didn't care about your attack, you'd need four stones to catch one.]

Capturing stones is really not important, though it sure is great fun to capture a large group. Watch some games of really good players and you will see, that they hardly capture stones. Territory is much more important.

You can practice capturing in 9x9-games.];W[ho];B[io];W[cc]

You will never be able to get the whole territory. So try to get territory where you are strong. In your case, in the upper left and right corner.]
