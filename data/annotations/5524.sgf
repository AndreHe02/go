C[A close game until black makes a silly mistake.  I feel horrible about my endgame so am looking to commetns specific for that in addition to general help.  Thank you.

[DP  OK.  In general, W outplayed B in the opening until the unnecessary attempt at reduction threw away the lead. B then outplays W in the middle game, mainly because W leaves a lot of weak groups around missing out the final defensive or shape move needed for them.  Around move 70 B is a good 30 points ahead, so would be good for you to practise a little more on knowing the score during the game.  It was only when B tried to save the G17 stones that you got back in the game.  And finally the K6 mistake hands you the game \]

[DP Your endgame is not bad - you're looking in the correct areas, but you're not following through your moves.  For example the B9 descent was good (although you thought it bad) but needed following up with B2.  Look for sente moves in the endgame - ones that your opponent must answer - and in particular ones which YOU would have to answer if he got there first.\]

[DP One area you should look at is leaving weak groups around on the board.  Try to ensure there's only one on the board at a time\]]
;B[pd]C[digital8 [10k\]: hello];W[pp];B[dd]C[digital8 [10k\]: have a good game
linguist [11k\]: tx];W[dq];B[qg]C[[DP This is not generally a good move.  The corner can still be invaded at the 3-3 point, so a kakari at O17 is still completely effective.  B would be better advised to play C5 or D5, approaching the asymmetrically placed W stone at D3\]]
;W[cf]C[[DP I'd go for O17 before B does actually secure the corner\]]
;B[cd]C[Don't know this or the next joseki.

[DP This isn't really joseki - it is good for W since B is weak at F17 still.  Your response should ideally be at D10\]]
;W[dk]C[[DP Sensible response, but a slight overplay, leaving an easy move for B around C12.  A stronger opponent might well punish you for this immediately\]]
;B[qo]C[[DP Again, hands initiative to W, who now secures the corner and gets sente\]]
;W[qp];B[pm]
(;W[jc]C[[DP Don't like this - encourages B to defend his weaknesses.  Just go straight for the jugular with G17 or O17.  Alternatively defend your own weaknesses with N3 for example.  But probably favourite would be a forcing sequence against B - see variation\]]
;B[fc];W[nc];B[oc];W[nb]C[[DP This is wrong.  Should almost always be towards the centre.  Playing here leaves the excellent move of O16 open to B who should play this immediately\]]

(;B[ob]C[[DP but you get lucky...\]]
(;W[ph]C[An attempt at reduction.

[DP Why?? There's no need!  You need convincing? OK, look at territory - B has 25 points top right and 15 points top left, and no moyo potential.  You have 15 points bottom right, and big moyo potential.  Purpose of reduction moves is to reduce moyos - so it is B who should be reducing, not you!  You should simply extend to O15\]]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[qk]C[[DP Oooh, this really hasn't gone well for W. B has made nice secure side territory, and W has a couple of loose stones in the centre.\]]
;W[qi]C[I this this move is bad.
[DP It's fine, but you must follow it up by splitting the groups with S11\]]
;B[rj]C[[DP This rash "reduction" has effectively lost W's advantage from the opening and handed the lead back to B.  Think about the territory / influence balance when you've got sente and are thinking about playing elsewhere.  A simple big point like D5 or E14 would give you a stranglehold on the game\]]
;W[lq]C[Too slow or safe territory grab?

[DP Needed doing sometime, much more urgent is something like O15 to try to link your weak groups.  Try to avoid having two weak groups on the board at the same time - a stronger player will destroy you in a situation like this\]]
;B[co]
(;W[fp]C[[DP The classic (played by the great Shusaku) and correct move here is E4\]]
;B[cl];W[ck];B[cq];W[cr]C[[DP Cripes you're not making it very hard for him!\]]
;B[bq];W[of]C[[DP Needs to be at O15 - this is too far away\]]
;B[pf]
(;W[pg]C[[DP No - pull back with P15. ALso note Q13 reduces your liberties - rarely a good idea\]]
;B[pe];W[gb]C[[DP No, you must complete the right hand side link up with O15.  Then attack\]]
;B[ge];W[ee]C[unconnected - I see now

[DP The bigger picture to see here is that you are strengthening B between two weak W groups. This is suicidal\]]
;B[de]
(;W[df];B[ef];W[ff]C[I was lucky this fight worked out, for the most part

[DP This should be E13, followed by F18 to shore up the weakened top group (letting B play G15 has weakened it)\]]
;B[eg];W[fe];B[nd]C[[DP This is a huge move by B which puts immense pressure on the W Q12 stones\]]
;W[lc];B[md]C[[DP This is a quiet move by B, preparing for O9 to destroy the Q12 stones - but I am not sure B saw this!\]]
;W[gd]C[[DP Better would have been something like C12 to secure the group and take the fight to the B E14 stones\]]

(;B[ed];W[fd];B[ch]C[[DP Ouch that hurts.  Excellent move by B who now has the lead comfortably\]]
;W[dh];B[dg];W[di];B[bf]C[[DP C13 better\]]
(;W[ro]C[[DP W continues to abandon his weak Q12 stones.... and his weak D9 stones... a move like D8 is what you want to strengthen a group, build presence in the centre (which will help Q12 stones later) and to attack the only weak B group\]]
;B[qn];W[ri];B[rh]
(;W[dn]C[[DP Arrgh!  Follow S11 through with T11 - then you can attack the R9 stones. And if you *are* going to play on the left, D8 is the move\]]
;B[cn];W[dm]C[Hoping to make a wall

[DP This will only work if you can do something with it.  Until Q7 stones are separated, the wall is pointless. The real big move for you is T11 to separate B and allow the weak Q12 stones to fight against something\]]
;B[cm];W[fi]C[[DP Horrible, given all the big points on the board, such as M5, E18, P19, T11, B9...\]]
;B[nk]C[[DP Lovely move by B putting real pressure on the Q12 stones\]]
;W[ni];B[si]C[[DP B doesn't really need to do this now that he has started to attack.  I would prefer something like M9, continuing the attack, threatening to cap, and destroying W's centre\]]
;W[oe];B[od];W[kj]C[[DP At this point B is winning by a country mile.  He has two absolutely secure corners worth 25 points each, 10 points lower left and pokes into the W moyo.  THat's 60 points.  W has one secure corner worth about 25 points and about 10 points up top for a total of 30\]]
;B[lf]C[[DP Mistake by B - should be in the L7 area to ensure W doesn't get a large area there\]]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[lh];B[he]C[[DP Horrible.  This is in effect the losing move by B, and certainly his biggest mistake. Leave this as a dead stone.  This hands the initiative back to W who should separate with K15. Trying to save these stones throws away B's big lead\]]

(;W[hd];B[ie];W[ld];B[le];W[je]C[good choice to fight?

[DP yes, but don't use contact moves.  They strengthen your opponent.  You have helped B link up with M16 earlier\]]
;B[jf];W[kg];B[ke];W[jd];B[jg];W[kh];B[kf];W[if]C[[DP and you get your reward for fighting where you are strong\]]
;B[hf]C[[DP Poor judgement by B - the ladder does not even begin to think about working\]]

;W[eh]
(;B[cg]
(;W[fb]C[bad move
[DP A bit wimpy when E18 is available, but not that bad\]];B[eb]
;W[ng]C[any other way to aim at the N15 cut, or is it safe?
[DP You can't cut it because of the N14 response which will capture your P14 stones if you resist.  But you're playing in the wrong area.  L7 would give you big centre territory and regain the lead\]]
;B[me];W[iq]C[slow?

[DP Yep - L6 or L7 much bigger\]];B[mn]C[[DP A bit slow, but good enough for B, aiming at either K6 next or O3\]]
;W[no];B[oo];W[op];B[nn];W[bk]C[bad move I think - I am drawn to these, and I don't know why
[DP They are NOT bad moves - but you don't know the follow-ups - that's what trips you up.  This puts huge pressure on the C6 stones, is sente, reduces B territory and stops him linking up.  That is 4 reasons to play this move.  If I played that well all the time I'd be 5 dan!\]]
;B[bl]
(;W[rn]C[[DP Small.  Follow up your B9 move with B2 - that's tough on B\]]
;B[rm];W[ko];B[kl]C[this is where I beleive he gets way too much.  I couldn't see the big picture

[DP Indeed - that's the L7 type move I've been going on about for about the last 50 moves... see comment on move 71\]

[DP But you really should be after B2.  Huge move in sente\]]
;W[jk];B[im];W[jl]C[DP You don't need to shore these up any more since J12 can be capture anytime. H5 might be better\]]

[DP Yep.  He wimped out of a big ko fight\]];W[hq];B[br]C[[DP B grabs some critical points and keeps the game close\]]
;W[dr];B[hl];W[gl];B[hk];W[jh];B[gk];W[gi]C[necessary?

[DP not really\]];B[ci];W[mk]C[aiming at something with the Q7 group and preventing this as a forcing move from black, but nothing meterializes.

[DP Keep an eye on connectivity.  This comes back to the T11 move you should have played earlier.  The Q7 group is also the Q16 group, so you're not going to get a big return since it is so strong\]]
