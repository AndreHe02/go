C[Hello Paul,

I'm your reviewer, known as Djif-Master on KGS.
I'll start with a short summary. I also added comments at the moves, I find quite important.

Summary:
General speaking I would say, that you omitted some important moves during the opening. Which left you with a worse position than your opponent. It is important to finish formations in the opening. I know, that it sometimes seems slow, but it pays out later in the game.
During the midgame you played very passive, not making use of your strenght. A proverb says: "Play away from strength." This means not to play to close to your own or opponent walls! During the game you played several moves to close to your own strength, which was passive style and made not enough territory.

I hope you find my comments helpful. Feel free to contact me, if you have further questions.

Best regards,
Felix a.k.a. Djif-Master];B[pd];W[dc];B[dq];W[pp];B[de];W[ce]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc]LB[ck:A][cn:B]TR[de][cf][dg]C[Black needs a stone on the left, to finish his upper left formation. That is why Black usually plays at 'A'. Making a shimari at 'B' is also a good idea. Space on the left is to close for White to invade easily.]
(;B[nq];W[cl]C[White can invade easily on the left because Black did not play there.]
;B[cj];W[co];B[cp];W[do];B[qm]LB[qn:C][ep:A][fp:B]TR[nq]C[Black again does not continue his formation. The lower left corner needs an additional stone at 'A' or 'B'.
This move would work well together with the marked black stone and it would attack the white group!
Locally, Black's move in the lower right should be at 'C'.]
;W[oo];B[pj];W[pr];B[kq];W[eq]C[Again, White can make use of Black not finishing his formation in the lower left.]
;B[er];W[fq];B[hq]LB[cr:A]C[Black should play at 'A' because if White plays there this move makes a lot of trouble. See variations.]

[ch:B][en:3][rq:2][br:A][lr:C]C[At this point I want to make a rough count. Because you had the feeling, that your were leading with 10 points. I think, that you missjudged your position:
Black has groups A to D.
A, B and C are all very small. I would say around 25 points max. together.
D is not secure territory yet. But it has big potential.
Black has groups 1 to 3.
Group 1 is about 15 points, group 2 about 5 points. Group 3 is allready 5 points of secure territory plus potential for further developement.
So the position seems equal.];B[qg]LB[jd:C][qq:B][or:A]C[This move is very passive. It makes solid territory, but there are other points, which are more urgent.
I would exchange Black 'A' for White 'B', to strengthen the bottom black group.
Then I would play at 'C' to create an even larger moyo.];W[pb]

;B[pc];W[ob];B[rc];W[qb];B[mb];W[sb]LB[kg:A][om:B]TR[nj]C[The sequence on the top was good for Black. White is enclosed and Black has a lot of power on the outside.
Because Black is so strong on the outside the next move at 'A' is not good. Black should start to attack the marked white stone at 'B'.]
(;B[kg];W[id];B[kd]C[This move is very passive. Black is not even making a lot of territory.
You may felt well, because of your big right side, but you forget about White's potential. Black's group on the bottom is very weak. White starts to attack this group later and makes a lot of profit. Black's single one big group won't be enough...]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[lj];B[nh]C[Another passive move. Black did not make use of his power. White gains influence in the center.]
;W[mp]C[White starts to attack Black's bottom group.];B[mq]

;B[if];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi];B[qi];W[bk];B[bj];W[ck]C[Last moves were usual. If we look again at the groups and territory we see, that Black has only on big group on the left. Worth about 45 points. The other two groups are both 10 points. So a rough estimate would be 65 points for Black.
White has 25 points on the top and 25 points on the left. Groups on top and bottom right are worth 10 points together. So White has 60 points plus komi! So again, the situation is about equal! Black is not leading.

From now on White got the bigger endgame moves, so that Black lost the game.]
