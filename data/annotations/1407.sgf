C[Commented by Nicolas Bourbotte  (nicobul), 15k on IGS];B[qd]
C[After getting an earlier game reviewed on the GTL, I decided to be more aggressive and invade my opponent's territory.  Not that it's helping -- I still can't stop my opponents' invasions, and am getting so little territory in compensation that I'm losing even worse than before.]
;W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[oc];W[dj]CR[jd][jp]C[So far these all look like reasonable opening moves, and I should be able to take one of the two remaining marked star points, so things look fairly equal for me.  But....]
;B[ed]C[Here I didn't know what to do, but I  figured my next move was the one  most likely to secure the corner.

NB:  This looks like a "reasonnable  opening move". If you don't want to  split the corner, then it is best to put  your corner stone at C17 or D16.

In the game, E17 is commonly played  to secure the corner (please see  variation)]

(;W[dc];B[ec];W[jp]CR[jd][pj]C[I'd better try to take more territory, and  this seems safer than an invasion at  either K16 or Q10.  Should I have tried  the invasion instead while Black has  fewer stones along either side?

I really have no clue which of the  moves would be best.

NB:
K4 is all right.
Note that the sequence on the upper  left is not finished: if white D14, then  black needs to play J16 or J17.]
;B[dn]C[Another invasion I don't know how to deal with.];W[nq]
CR[cl]C[I think this may have been a mistake,  in light of Black's next move.  But if I  try to defend either D3 or D10, I'm  probably going to end up losing a  bunch of territory on the right-hand  side.

Would C8 have been better?

NB:
D6 is premature.
For now you can play elsewhere (O3 is  ok)
Else jump directly to C7.];B[ck]C[They say that play starts in the corners, then goes to the side, and then in the middle.  So I figured I should try to keep him from getting the entire left-hand side.  It didn't work that way.]
;W[cj]C[Is this a mistake?  I should probably  try to connect the stone at D10 to  something, most likely the group at  C16.  I thought this would do it, but the  following sequence shows otherwise.

NB:
Looks bad!
A go proverb says: "extend 3 stones  from a 2 stones wall". If you had a  stone at C14 or D14, then C10 would  be perfect. But C16 is 5 stones away.  Much too far!
I would try C13 instead.];B[dk]C[Is this a mistake?  I should probably  try to connect the stone at D10 to  something, most likely the group at  C16.  I thought this would do it, but the  following sequence shows otherwise.

(;W[ek]C[NB:
E9 looks like an attempt to kill black.
The left side has never been your "territory".  You had initially 2 stones (D10 and D3), but  this doesn't mean they were surrounding  "territory".
Now black wants to settle between those  stones. So be it! He will get small life. You  needn't kill him.
The right side is much bigger, don't you think?  (please see variation)]
;B[cp];W[dp]C[I doubt it's possible to stop Black  from making two eyes here.  So, I  thought this move would make it  easier for me to secure the  territory along the bottom than had  I played C3.

NB:
Once again, your 2 stones are  much too far from K4.
C3 is good to make a few points in  the corner, but I would prefer F4  here.]
;B[co];W[cq];B[pn];W[pi]C[Since I've lost a bunch of territory on the left-hand side, I need to invade Black's territory to make some of it back up.  I figured that a right-side invasion would be more likely to succeed than an invasion at the top, since Black looks stronger there.]
;B[ic];W[qk]C[NB:
No! R8];B[rm];W[pq]CR[nn][lf]C[Looking at the rest of the game, I  don't think this was the right way  to go about attacking Black.   Would either something like O6 or  M14 have been better?  Both look  like they produce more influence  in the center and are worth more  than the few points in the corner  that Q3 gains.

But, you're supposed to play in  the corners first, followed by the  sides and only then the center,  so....

NB: I don't understand M14 nor  O6.
Q3 is ok, provided you be the fist  to play, after the bottom right  corner is over.
I mean you have to secure your  stones at R14, before black gets  the oportunity to play R13.]
;B[qq]
(;W[pr]C[This doesn't look too good either  now.  Does White have more  territory after the variation I've  included?

NB:
Black will not necessarily follow  the variation.
What if he plays R13 (eventually  followed by P13) instead of, say,  Q2 in var2 ?]
;B[qp];W[qf];B[re];W[rf]MA[ne]C[I wanted to defend my invasion on  the side, but would it have been  safe even if I tried to increase the  central influence with a move like  O15?

NB:
At first sight, I would play S14 too.
But considering how huge a upper  side black O15 would make...
Then O15 is good.];B[cf];W[ce];B[ef];W[be];B[de];W[dd]C[NB: Not necessary]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[gp];W[gq];B[el];W[fk];B[fl];W[in]CR[gl]C[Since I missed C14 a while back,  now I have to try to connect the  group from D10-F9 to something  else, and I guessed (wrongly) that  a move like this would connect it  to my stones at the bottom and  take away Black's influence  growing toward the center.

Would G8 have been better?

NB: B13 links B15 and C10];B[hl];W[om]C[I don't know if I can do anything  with the stones between C10 and  F9 anymore, so it might be better  to try to hem Black into the bottom  right-hand corner.

NB:
Rescue the C10 group... or resign!
B13!!!];B[np];W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[no];W[mp];B[nm];W[nk];B[pm]
;W[ol];B[fi];W[ei]TR[cj][dj][ek][fk]C[I probably should have sacrificed the four marked stones in favor or building influence somewhere else, but already I appear to be terribly far behind.  There's no way I could gain enough territory in the center to make up for what Black would have on the left side and the top.  Only 60 moves have been played and I'm probably lost already.]
;B[eh];W[dh];B[fh];W[dg];B[df];W[bf];B[cg]C[NB: B13 can still save the C10  group
But look how black has build a  wall from E17 to F11.];W[ch]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[ag]TR[bh][ch][dh][dg][ei][cj][dj][ek][fk]C[And now I won't be able to make  two eyes with these groups.  I can  make one eye around C11 or D11,  but Black should be able to make  the "eye" at E10 a false eye.

NB:  Right.
The best move now is ... resign!
( and ask your partner for another  game )];W[ah];B[bj];W[bi]
;B[bk];W[ej];B[gk];W[kl];B[jk];W[jh]TR[nk][pi][qf]C[I thought my stones on the  right-hand side were exerting  influence toward the center, but  apparently they aren't.

NB:  Something like L12 or even M12  would be more reasonable]
;B[hf]C[NB: Black is prudent];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg]
;B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[mj];B[mh];W[ng]TR[jh][kh][kg]
[kf][je]C[I'd better stop Black from connecting the stones in the center and the stones in the upper-right corner.  But as it is I'm going to end up with virtually no territory on the right side.  The invasion has effectively been a failure.

Also, the marked stones are probably dead, too.

My position now looks even worse than after move 60.  I might get a little territory along the bottom, in the top-left corner, and along the right-hand side.  But Black has the bottom right corner, and almost the entire top, left side, and center, along with a bunch of extra points for killing a bunch of my stones.]

(;W[cr]C[I don't think this was necessary and cost me a point.  Not that it matters considering how badly I'm losing at this point.

I probably could have saved a few points by playing at E18, but didn't see it at the time.]
;B[db];W[cb];B[eb];W[af];B[ca];W[ba];B[da];W[bb]C[And here I only end up with 8 points in the top corner.  Playing C2 instead of E18 effectively cost me 5 points.]
