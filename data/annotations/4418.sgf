C[Any comments will help

pajaro: Hi. I'll try to review your game and point out the biggest mistakes. I hope you can learn something from my review. I'll start my comments as pajaro.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[qn];W[jq];B[hq];W[mq];B[dj];W[cq]
TR[cm][cn][fq]C[pajaro: This is probably too early. Black will get strong and will make a moyo on the left. White can wait, because there are more points to invade, some marked here.]
;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr];B[gr];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]
;B[cn]C[pajaro: Ok, white is sente, but the 2 white stones at the bottom are now in b's influence.]
;W[cf]C[pajaro: A sanrensei (3 in a row) at the top would be bigger, but I think this might be ok too, preventing b playing there and getting a bigger moyo at the left.]
;B[jc]
(;W[hc]C[pajaro: When you opponent makes a splitting invasion such as K17, you have two chances. First, you can wait and see what will happen, because whatever you do, b will have room to extend. Second, if you attack now, you should do it from the weaker side towards the stronger. In this case, this is the wrong side. This is to avoid an attack on your weaker side. See var.]
;B[nc];W[lc]C[pajaro: I think this is too much. Considering that it's b's turn, who is better here? Both sides have splitted positions. This can be when b has a chance to counterattack.]
;B[qf]
(;W[oc]C[pajaro: The proverb says "don't attach a weak stone". You would like to attack O17. Now, you are helping it to get stronger. I think that just P15 is ok. See var.]
;B[nd];W[qe]C[pajaro: Notice that san-san remains open for b.]
;B[je];W[nb];B[mb];W[ob];B[mc];W[pf];B[qg];W[re]C[pajaro: Why this? Is it sente? No, black doesn't feel threatened. Does it defend? No, white is already alive. Does it attack? Hardly, b doesn't feel any pressure. This is yose. You should try to have in mind the idea of sente. think that if a player is always in control of a game, he can't lose.]
;B[pj]C[pajaro: Now black takes control of the last big point.]
;W[he];B[fc];W[jb]C[pajaro: This is dubious... I'm not sure that b will answer this. Always consider tenuki if there is no risk of death.]
;B[ib];W[ic];B[kb]
(;W[hb]C[pajaro: In this case, another sequence is expected, see var.]
;B[ja]
(;W[ec]C[how about something like f15 instead?

pajaro: This is ok, It protects the corner and pushes towards the strong position. If f15, see var.]
;B[fe];W[gg];B[fg];W[fh];B[eg];W[eh];B[dh];W[dg]C[just connect at g12 be better?]
;B[gh]
(;W[ff]C[lost a lot here and kind of felt like i lost the game from this point on. do you see how maybe i could of handled this situation better?

pajaro: I always find comlicated to judge these sequences. I'll show some possible variations.]
;B[ef]
(;W[gf]C[pajaro: In this case, see the squeeze possible. See var.]
;B[fi];W[ee];B[ei];W[df];B[np]C[pajaro: White lost a big chance.]

pajaro: Black is huge everybody because w played a bad fuseki, giving b all the big points. W should try to have a wider approach to the board, not trying to save every stone and trying to see where the bigger areas are, without playing every sequence to the end. Also,sente and gote are worth remembering.]
