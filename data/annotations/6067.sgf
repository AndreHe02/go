C[Hello!

My name is Bernd, and this game was played on KGS. I am the black one, HonFu.

I always get in trouble with weakness - also in this game. I had a huge moyo from two sides into the center, but my opponent cut his way into it from so many sides, that finally I lost by a few points. Please help me to see, how and why this could happen, and what I could have done for more safety.

Thank you!

B: Hi, I'm Ben Bildstein. I'll prefix my comments with "B:".

Before even looking at the game, let me respond to your opening comment. I'd say huge moyos tend to get reduced. y a lot. In fact if you can't reduce a moyo, it means it's not a moyo, it's a huge territory. Think about it - I've certainly played games against stronger players where the realisation hit me like a slap in the face, that there moyo wasn't really a moyo, and I had already lost. But enough about me.

Remember that with a moyo, you shouldn't have to turn it into territory. It should be flexible enough that if your opponent attacks one way, then you get something else in return. I'l ltry to return to this idea when I see the game.

If you have trouble making the most of your moyo, it could simply be that you need to try to make some real territory instead! You don't want to spend your whole life wondering why your moyo got reduced - if you make territory and your oponent makes a big moyo, it becomes *his* problem how to deal with it.

Okay, that's enough to say for now, given I haven't even seen the game yet.]
;B[pc];W[cp];B[pp];W[cc]C[B.: Here I considered to play chinese, but it seemed to me more important to make a kakari-extension double purpose move.

Okay, I won't bother putting "B:" for my comments, as you're already doing that. I'll just comment...

I don't agree. Here c17 is settled, and c4 is looking towards q4, making the left side uninteresting. I think you could be happy with Chinese. But of course it is not the only option. My point is simply to remind you that a move like c17 leaves that corner uninteresting, and because of where c4 is, the whole side is uninteresting.]
;B[ep]C[BB: Okay, I'll go the second B, for "BB:"

This is definitely a good move. I can't fault it.];W[eq];B[fq]
;W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[BB: Okay, I have to say I think you're ahead. You're clearly controlling more of the board. Your stones at the bottom are clearly working better the White's stones on the left, and you've got q17 as well. Your stones are high, and hence useful. White's stones are ALL low (i.e. on the third line). c17 is too far from the action.]
;W[fd]C[B.: Instead of playing kakari, I considered K16, R11 and C11. Was one of them better, or was there another, even better move?

BB: Do you mean instead of e4? r11 would be okay, but to c11 and k16, I say NO! c11 because that whole side is uninteresting, with both c6 and c17 low (third line). k16 because it approaches a settled stone (c17) and also q17is low from that perspective. Between the top and the right, the right was the more interesting.

If that's not what you meant, and you still want my opinion, send me an e-mail.]
;B[qf]C[BB: Keep in mind that this makes a move at the top really big. White should play there now. Something like k17 or l17. These moves would work really well with the White stones at the top left, and stop you from making such an extention from your new position in the top right.]

(;W[qn]C[BB: Should be at the top. See var.]
(;B[ql]C[BB: Here you're opting not to make territory, choosing to attack instead. That's okay, but keep it in mind. If you decide to try a more territorial strategy, play a move like o3 instead (it works quite well with the bottom side). See var.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[BB: OK I can see why you did this, but it's worth considering r4, which is after all more conventionally joseki. Here the choice is obviously between the bottom and the right sides, and k4 is high while r14 is low. But if you did play r4, you'd have the whole right side to yourself. This way, White connects and you commit yourself to making something of the bottom, where you don't even have one corner.]

(;B[pm];W[qm];B[rl];W[sn]
(;B[pl]C[B.: Gote. And an open skirt. But what else could I have done?

BB: For starters, p7 instead of q8. Now the cutting points are just awful. With q8 at p7, you only have one cutting point, and of course q8 as a cutting point, but that's not bad at all. You'd love White to cut there!

I've explored some variations to answer your question...];W[kc]
C[BB: I think jumping under with p2 is even bigger.];B[ci]C[B.: I thought it was urgent to prevent a moyo here. Would E7, L15 or another move have been better?

BB: q2 is bigger. e7 is also great, as it's a classic reduce-while-expanding move.]
;W[cf]C[BB: c11/c14 constitue a good exchange. You don't even need to defend there - c11 has done it's work. q2 now.]

(;B[cl];W[en]C[BB: You've just pushed white exactly where he wanted to go. Be7 would have been better.

Loot at it this way: who had the large potential territory?]
;B[gn]C[B.: I played on the moyo diagonal and thought, my two-space-extension was able to survive alone.

BB: Yes, but it's heavy now. You'll keep paying for that...]
;W[lq]C[B.: And immediately he invaded. While playing G6 I didn't think about the open bottom.

BB: You call that immediately? I say he should have played p2 before l17!

As Black now, I'd play q2 or o3 - let White struggle to live.]

;B[is];W[or];B[ps];W[mr]
(;B[mp];W[mq];B[ke]C[B.: I saw a sequence to kill the group at the bottom, starting with o2, but the group is not confined very well, and I was afraid to push it in the direction of my prospective center territory.

I don't see any sequence to kill. But also I agree with your logic anyway.]
;W[ic]
(;B[ie]C[BB: Perhaps n17 instead?];W[ns]C[BB: See vriation for if Black attacked the bottom.]
;B[fl];W[lo];B[lm]C[BB: l5 instead.];W[nc];B[ne]C[B.: This move leaves a weakness, which white will exploit later. Was P15 better?

BB: I like this.];W[gg]C[B.: To cut or not to cut? I wasn't sure if my stones would do alright, but I knew I needed a lot of territory from my moyo, so I cut.

BB: Not to cut. Surely White can live in the centre. Surely you can't actually kill him, even if you can cut him off. And when he does, how can you win?]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[ge];W[fe];B[he]C[BB: h14 takes away one of White's liberties.]
;W[gc]C[BB: White shouldn't bother playing this.];B[fg];W[fh]
;B[eh];W[ei];B[gh];W[fi];B[hh];W[ef]C[B.: I must have done something wrong ... but if I had ataried at h13, I would have opened a new road into my moyo for my opponent.

BB: Yes, but White already has a road in - l6.];B[gj];W[ek]
;B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[bp];B[cm];W[dm];B[cg];W[eg];B[bf]C[BB: Do you think you're dead on the left? Or do you think this is sente?]
;W[ce];B[sl];W[sm];B[qs];W[rr];B[rs]C[BB: I guess I don't need to tell you this is a gift.]
;W[bk];B[ck];W[ao];B[sq]C[B.: I thought about this move a while earlier and was so excited to play it - just to find out that I counted wrong. Well, everybody knows this ...]
;W[rp];B[sp]C[B.: Mistake.];W[sr];B[am];W[bh]C[Here I read a while. Could I capture it, if I connect? I thought I could. Mistake.

BB: I don't think you can capture. You just need to live.]
(;B[bg];W[ch];B[dh];W[di]C[Hadn't read out his ataries right.]
;B[dg];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[ah];W[oe]C[I knew he would try something around there, but there was just no time to fix it ...]
;B[od];W[nd];B[me];W[qd]C[BB: Br17 is the obvious move.];B[pe]
;W[qc]C[And now the bitter loss of the corner.]

;B[lc];W[lb];B[kd];W[jc];B[bl];W[dk];B[jn];W[gi]C[B.: Now. I thought I could defend alright here, but he is going to push my borderline so far back ...]
;B[hi];W[hj]
(;B[gk]C[BB: I'd have to call this the losing move. W j13 is just too good. Here the normal idea is to fall back as soon as possible. In this case, try B j10.]
;W[ig];B[jh];W[ih];B[jj];W[ii]
(;B[ik]C[BB: k11. m12 is another idea, too.];W[ji];B[ki];W[jf]
;B[je];W[kh];B[lh];W[kg];B[lg]C[B.: I even had to give up 3 stones. Or did I miss something?

BB: Not really.];W[li];B[kj];W[ij];B[lp];W[hk];B[hl];W[mi];B[il]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[jg];B[mg]C[B.: Looks bad, but helps the stones to crawl out between the two invaders, P15 and M11 group. After N14 I was afraid of the sequence N13, M15, N12, M14, P14 and maybe the defeat of my whole top.

This is not a bad move.];W[be];B[af];W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[rg]
;W[er]C[BB: Okay so you have sente. Don't give it up...];B[qe]
C[BB: Yes, sente.];W[rd];B[md]C[BB: Yes, big at least.];W[ob]
;B[oa]C[BB: No, gote.];W[na];B[pa]C[BB: Wouldn't you rather play a15?]

C[B.: Wrong sequence, as it seems to me. Just descending to the 2nd line would have been better, right?

Yes.];W[js];B[oq]C[B.: My final hope. Would he get impatient and take J2?]
