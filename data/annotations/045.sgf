 JamesL 20k : hi];W[dp];B[jd];W[qf];B[qh];W[of]C[This move should normally be made if you intend to capture the black
stone (R12) below it.  Otherwise it makes your invasion to come more
difficult, without giving you much in return.];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd]
(;W[pc]C[This move is not Joseki; better is S17 (see previous variation)]
;B[oc]C[The nice shape black has here is a result of the exchange of
O16 for P14 earlier];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[qa];B[oh];W[mf]
;B[ld]C[The three white stones are now a liability, and black is being
strengthed on both sides.  As it turns out, these white stones will
eventually die.  They should have been given up when they were just a single
stone.  Even if they lived, they wouldn't be worth the influence they give
black on each side.];W[og];B[pg];W[pf];B[rg];W[rf];B[sf];W[ph]C[This move is worse than useless.  Don't give your opponent a
pon-nuki shape.];B[pi];W[qg];B[ri];W[jp]C[This is a good move, showing that you know when to give up.
Three stones across the bottom like this are fairly powerful.];B[nq];W[lq]
;B[no];W[pn];B[pq]C[This move, the tsuke, seems preferable to the 3-3 invasion in
this situation.];W[qq];B[pr]C[I don't think this is Joseki for black, but it is not unreasonable.]
;W[qr];B[op];W[po];B[ql];W[qm]C[This move seems timid.  Perhaps Q8 would be better, choosing
outside influence
over territory.];B[rm];W[rn];B[pm];W[qn];B[pl];W[mh]C[This is a purely defensive move and gives black a chance to
defend his one weak group
(the group around O3) while attacking white.

Better would be a kakari against D16, an attempt to cut off the black O3 group
(which would probably be premature), an extension to D10, or, my favorite,
a shimari such as D6 to work with the stones at K4 and M3 while making the
corner more difficult to invade.];B[dj];W[cl];B[fp];W[fq];B[gq];W[eq];B

[nj];W[mj];B[nk];W[dm];B[fk]C[This move is a good move by black, connecting his groups and making a
territorial framework.];W[en]C[I would invade near the upper left corner rather than make this move.
This move should be followed up with an attempt to cut off and kill the
black group below it, but since it is made to early, it never gets used
for that purpose.];B[fd]C[While this isn't a bad move, I think black would have been
wiser to defend the

corner with C17 after which white would have a very hard time with any invasion.]
;W[cf]C[This is, as white proved, not a bad move; but a 3-3 invasion or a C16 tsuke
would have been safer.  C12 could also be considered, threating to connect
at B10 or else invade with greater strength.];B[ce];W[df];B[ch]C[This is a very severe move by black.  I am surprized that white
managed to live.];W[cj]C[This is a bad move, since it proves to neither connect white or cut black.
Better moves include a 3-3 invasion (giving up the 2 stones just played,
but in that case it would have been better to invade earlier.  F14 or
D12 are propably the best ways for white to try to live here.];B[di];W[ff]
;B[hd]C[I think black would have been wiser to play H15, defending his
side as effectively
and making a more sever attack on white.  Another play might have been E15 to

strengthen his corner before playing H15 or H14.  Black has influence below which
he should be pushing white into.];W[ec]C[This is a good move by white and the start of a nice sequence.]

(;B[ed]C[black should consider C17 instead of this move, which should be able to keep
white separated although black would have to scramble to live in the corner
after he was separated.  See variation.];W[cc];B[be];W[gc];B[hc]C[black should have cut at D17 instead of making this move.]
;W[gd];B[ge];W[fc];B[gf]C[again, black should cut at D17 now.  He is asking for trouble.]
;W[fe]C[A good agressive move.  I credit this with making it possible for white's
stones to live.];B[fg];W[eg]
(;AW[bg];B[de]C[A very poor move by black.  The throw in at E14 would probably kill white
(see variation).];W[ef]C[forcing with F12 before this move might be better, or giving up
the two stones
to the snapback and connecting with B12.];B[bg]C[I would prefer B14, making the connection while also reducing white's
liberties.];W[fh];B[gg];W[bf]C[I like the sequence white begins here];B
[af];W[dh];B[ci];W[cg];B[bh];W[fi];B[ei];W[eh];B[fj]C[Black should play H11 instead.  Even if his D10 group is cut off, it can
live easily enough and has more liberties than the white group being
attacked.];W[hi];B[ji];W[hh]C[A nice move, bamboo connections are handy.]
;B[jg];W[ig]C[This move is counter-productive, especially with it's follow up.  White
strengthens black without gaining anything.];B[jf];W[if];B[ie];W[ij];B[jj]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[il];B[mk]C[ JamesL 20k : is entering byo-yomi


Note that the white group starting from R14 P14 has again become a liability.]
;W[kh]C[I would suggest L9 first, threating to surround the three stones at K9-K11.
But I don't know if it would save the group.];B[jh];W[lg]C[I think L13 or L11 are better.  L13 M13 leads to the capture of M13.]
;B[ki]
(;W[li]C[This move is foolish, and the whole situation may be hopeless, although I
see some prospects from L13 (see variation).];B[kg];W[lk]C[This is now useless...]

C[This move is unneeded, and could be better used elsewhere, such as K6.]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[fo];W[hm];B[hn];W[bc];B[jr];W[kr]C[ flyboy 22k*: is entering byo-yomi

J1 or possibly K1 would be better, I think.];B[is];W[jq];B[js];W[ks];B[hs]
;W[hq]C[This wasted move cost you your group...];B[mr];W[mp]C[K6 would be better, I think.  This isn't a forcing move.]

;B[om];W[ml];B[kl];W[ip];B[ko];C[A final general comment:

   I think you need to learn to offer more tradeoffs to your opponent, so
that either way he/she plays, you win something and he/she wins something.
Much of Go seems to be orchestrating these tradeoffs.  For example, you
can often kill a group only after making an approach move which if
properly replied to just gives you a little extension to some existing
territory; but if your opponent decides you have extended too far and
cuts you off, they suddenly find their larger group in trouble.
   Or, as in this game in the last variation, where you could have forced
black to choose between connecting to either of two of your otherwise
dead groups.
   You thought up and played out a few very nice sequences in the course
of the game.

Cheers,
Mike S.])
