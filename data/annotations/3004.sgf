AB[dd][dp][pd]C[[Hikaru79\]: This was a 3-stone handicap game played for Canada's Youth Go Online tournament... I took white and gave my opponent three stones. I got desperate through the game, made many deep invasions, made small, living groups all over the place, and still lost by a crushing amount. It seems the weight of the three handicap stones stopped me from making enough territory to compete. I'll make some comments and questions on the SGF throughout the game. ^__^ Thanks for the review!]

(;W[pp]C[[Hikaru79\]: Is occupying the last corner OK in 3-handi, or should white take the offensive immediatly?

This is OK, if not mandatory.
See some basics at the end for Hcp games];B[nq];W[qn];B[jq]
C[This is too loose by Black. This does not exist.

You can punish this later with M3.
You could even go now (see variation next stone)]
(;W[qf]MA[nc]C[This is not the best direction, since it is on the same side as your first corner. Rather choose O17.]
;B[qh]MA[pp][qn]C[Not good at all.
B will live small against your corner];W[of];B[nd];W[pi];B[qk]
C[[Hikaru79\]: As far as I know, R9 should have been at R11, for this joseki. I did my best to punish R9, but was there a better way to do so?

Right.
B is going to feel bad after you split his two stones.];W[qi]
C[Yes.];B[ri];W[rj];B[ok];W[mp];B[lq];W[mq];B[mr];W[np];B[oq]
;W[pq]TR[mq]MA[lq][mr][nq]C[[Hikaru79\]: Would P4 work to cut for black here?

I give an exaple of what can happen if B pushes too hard at P4.
Because of the marked shape, t does not work very well.]
(;B[rk];W[rh];B[rg];W[si];B[rf];W[fc];B[fd]C[[Hikaru79\]: This attachment is a recurring theme throughout the game. I only really know two joseki for this variation, so I took the easier course of action here. What would have been a better response to F16?

This is considered the standard response, and probably the better in this situation.

There is a joseki with E16, but it is out of scope here.];W[gd]
;B[fe];W[ec];B[dc];W[ic];B[dj]SQ[de][ed]TR[dd][dp][fe][jq]LB[cf:F]
[cj:D][cn:C][cq:B][dk:E][fj:A]C[[Hikaru79\]: I have a feeling that D10 is a bit too far, and it leaves the black in the top left a bit vulnerable, but I wasn't confident enough to take advantage of that. How should D10 be countered?

There are *many* ways to enter a moyo (triangled stones)

You can either 
- "reduce it" (A) This is often as efficient as invading
- invade corner (B). Not good at this stage, and to be saved for later.

- invade on side (C). I give the common joseki in the next stone, as variation.

-invade in the middle (D or E) to settle under B, or cut in two.

There is also a trick play at F (threatenening the cut at squares), but again, this is out of scope for now.]

(;W[qg]C[ok, though somewhat small. this is sente against the 2 B stones.]
;B[qe];W[fq]C[[Hikaru79\]: In hindsight, an approach at C6 would have been better, right?

Maybe.
Here you risk to be covered by B, which will strenghen its moyo.]
;B[fp]C[eh ...];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[do];W[gp];B[fo];W[cq]MA[cr]
[dq]C[hmm, risky];B[dq];W[cr]C[Ouch !

Stay Connected !!!

this will cost you a lot.
Normally, one of your groups should die.];B[dr];W[cp];B[co]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[bp]C[Ouch !

The correct move is A4.
B can kill this shape]
(;B[gq]
(;W[hp]C[too submissive (see var)];B[hq];W[gr]C[Useless. Move H4]
;B[hr];W[ds];B[es];W[cs];B[cm];W[io];B[ip];W[hn];B[jo]C[Hmm.
B is helping W to make good shape (see var).];W[jn];B[ko];W[lp]
;B[kq];W[kn]C[small.];B[kc]C[Ah. Too late for W.
But There is still a weakness at P17.];W[ie]C[good];B[ke]
(;W[mn]TR[ok][qk][rk]MA[lk]C[[Hikaru79\]: Was this move neccesary? I made it in a state of paranoia of my groups not making life on their own and needing to be connected.

Locally, this is good, and a good principle at Hcp games.

However, here :
- this is gote, and B earned a move.
- you group is not in a bad shape. You can save this move for the time you are under heavy attack.
- If your group is weak, then strengthen it *by attacking* B from it. (M9 aiming at the marked stones)

You will disover the importance of sente, because you don't have a free move until ... too late.

Other than that, you can usefully use your group to reduce at F10 (see variation)]
;B[ao];W[br]C[good];B[aq];W[ap];B[ar];W[as];B[bs];W[iq]MA[an]
[er]C[OK, fair threat.
However, before that, you can choose inttrinsic life ko moves.]
;B[ir];W[as];B[on];W[bq]MA[an]C[A6 better.];B[op];W[oo]MA[po]
C[Rather protect the corner, because you threat to connect anyway.
If B blocks at P5, you can connect on the left with M5];B[po]

;W[qr]
(;B[qs]C[[Hikaru79\]: Could black have killed with S1 instead?

eh, of course not !];W[sp];B[ro];W[sn]C[You complicate !
Q1 was enough ...];B[qm];W[er];B[pl];W[rs];B[os]C[bad idea.
F2 was required !];W[fs]C[!!];B[so];W[sq];B[nm];W[nn];B[ol]
;W[on];B[mm];W[lm]MA[lo]C[B is easy on W.
M5 was spending eye shape, and very sente.];B[ge];W[he]C[not safe.
Don't leave weaknesses such as G17 ...


At this time, the game is still playable for W, because the left side can still be invaded.]
;B[gn];W[lo]C[[Hikaru79\]: Another move born of paranoia. I doubted the ability of that group to make two eyes, so I figured losing two stones to the snapback at H5 is worth a free eye. Also in hindsight, that group probably wouldn't have had any trouble living without M5, right?

Yes, that is about right (see my previous comment about this group).]
;B[ho];W[in];B[gj]C[Too late (refer to my previous comment)

The whole sequence until here has been played with B sente.

Therefore, W could not allow time to invade left.

Now it will be more difficult.];W[ll];B[mk];W[cg]C[[Hikaru79\]: Too deep?

No much choice if you want to invade.
I would have tried, though very daring.];B[ch];W[be];B[bd];W[cd]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[de];W[ad];B[bc];W[bh];B[ci];W[af];B[bi];W[bg]
;B[dg]C[[Hikaru79\]: This could have killed if it were at A12 instead, I think...

Not killed right away, because the group can try to run to the centre, but yes, dangerous.]
;W[ah];B[mf];W[ni]MA[hg]C[The points are in the centre now]
;B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[ig];B[gg]C[[Hikaru79\]: This is the first time I realize how behind I really am on territory. I'd been so caught up on my minor victories of living groups all over the place that I'd totally lost sight of the fact that I had practically nothing. Was the game lost already by now, or did I still have a chance?

At this time, you can only hope to kill something, but this is very unlikely.

If you consider, it partly happens because of your stone at F3 that got capped by E4]
;W[gl];B[fl]
(;W[gm]C[[Hikaru79\]: Was this too passive? Would F7 have been better?

Yes, probably (see var)];B[fm];W[jj];B[kh];W[jh]MA[ai][ps]C[Hmm, you are playing dame points here ...
This does not achieve very much.

There is still some invasion possible at P17, or big yose points]

[qs][rf][rg][ri][rr][sh][ss]C[[Hikaru79\]: Well, there it is... my main questions are:

1) What would have been the ideal time to invade black's giant middle-left territory?

About when I mentionned it.
That was rather a direction mistake when you played F4.
Otherwise, as you saw, it was nearly impossible during the course of the game until B played G10


2) How could I have better utilized my influence around the L6 area earlier on?

I showed this, I think.

3) What is the ideal strategy to adopt against 3-stone handi players?


Okay, basic rules at handicap for W are :
- settle quicly on side
- use you settled groups to attack B
- don't crawl under 4th line, run to the centre
