C[Hi I am your reviewer Chris, I will review for both sides, but I will focus mainly on Black's moves, since that is where the questions came from.

This was an interesting game. The tactical blunder on the top right by black led to some very strategic consequences. Later black saved his damaged stones in the top right with a ko, but winning the ko came at a very high price. White earned huge influence, which black did recognize in time, allowing white to build a large territory in upper left region. This, combined with a joseki/direction error on the bottom right, allowed white to take a lead in the game, and when black misplayed in a fight on the bottom left, white's lead became decisive. Until, that is, white made the final mistake, losing some stones to give black a narrow win. Truly, go is a marathon!]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[iq];W[pj]
(;B[od]C[Question: Another better move ?

I normally avoid this move, because it is easy for white to make a severe pincer, e.g. with N16, and white has a stone at Q10 waiting. In situations like this, where your opponent already has two stones on the side, I prefer to approach at O17 (O16 is also possible). That way it's easier to settle. See variations.]
(;W[jd]C[This is a very odd move. Not wrong exactly but lacking severity.]
(;B[of]C[Question: i think something is wrong still, isn't it ?

It's ok. Might want to consider playing on top and not giving white easy points here.]
;W[qf];B[qc]
(;W[pc]C[White can't do this.];B[pd];W[qe]
(;B[rc]C[This direction is extremely risky. Very complex things arise out of this.]
(;W[pb]C[One option.]
(;B[qb]C[This is a catastrophe. Anytime you're playing empty triangles this early in a game, almost certainly something has gone horribly wrong.]
(;W[cn]C[White lets you off the hook in a big way.];B[ep]C[Nothing is more urgent than P18 for black.]
;W[cj]C[C9 is probably better, but this is playable.];B[cl]
C[Premature and pointless fight. C6 is not important. As a general principle, capturing a single stone is usually not worth it. Here, you'd have to play at least 2-3 stones to securely capture it, to gain what, 6 points?

Again, P18 is the best move. Other good moves include F17, R6, E6]
;W[en]C[Now you have a target.];B[el];W[gn]C[Bear in mind white can connect at C8 anytime]
;B[gp]
(;W[cg];B[kc]C[A bit odd. Locally, P18 is best. However, why abandon the fight on the bottom left? That is the main action now.]
;W[nb]C[Mistake from white. Usually, O17 is the correct shape.]
(;B[pa]C[Big mistake. See variation.]

;W[dc];B[pa];W[eb];B[na]C[Well, black has saved his pitiful stones in the top right, but at a very high price. Because of white's colossal strength in upper left, the game is very hard for black now.]
;W[fc]C[Much too slow. Better to let black be a target for attack. White should approach at R6]
;B[cd]C[Question: how can i make alive upper left group ?

(;B[bc];W[if]
(;B[er]C[Too small. Minor groups in the corner are not relevant at this stage. Right now black should be looking to neutralize white's strength in upper left, or growing own moyo from bottom right.]
;W[bp]C[Not important. R6];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[bs];B[ar]C[Good kill]
;W[nq]C[Wrong direction. A very greedy move. This will create problems. Much better to approach the other side. That way white grows his own group, without creating problems.]

Not good. Attack!];W[qn];B[np];W[qq]
