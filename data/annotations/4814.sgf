AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi this is Fatih from Turkey.

Hey Fatih,

I am Alfa, from the Manitoba Go Association in Manitoba, Canada.  I am going to be reviewing your game for the GTL (gtl.xmp.net).

I will review primarily from the side of black, but will also throw in the side of white with some good explanations.  It should help get you in a good frame of mind when playing another 4 stone handicap game.

Any questions to: iamtengen@gmail.com
KGS: BlaiddDrwg


Final Thoughts at end of review (move 230)];W[nc]LB[jc:I][kc:G]
[lc:F][jd:E][kd:D][ld:C][nd:H][pf:B][qf:A][jj:J]C[These are the most standard openings in a handicap game for black.  

A:
When you played A, this is a very defensive move, it is very sold and means you do not have to defend as much in the future.

B: Is a larger move, and gets more territory on the right side.  It does have a few follow ups and is preferred in handicap games, to teach you how to properly use the 4th line.

C to I:
These are much more agressive and means a fight will break out early.  These can often work to your benifit if you make influence.  

J: will turn the game into a 5 stone handicap game.  Tengen will be a very strong stone for the rest of the game and is good to place now.

*With the pincers C-G,I they are turn out same or similar ways.

**Cut and seperate as often as you can. You have the advantage, and most ladders should work in your favour.]

C[Thank you for your precious time.

The game was overall well played. With a few minor tweaks to your play, you will advance quickly.

Attack (for the purpose of killing) less.  You expect to kill your opponents groups too much.  It is better (and easier) to make them live small in the corner.  It is ideal to do so while keeping sente, and small groups leave ko threats for endgame.

It does not matter how strong we get, there is always room for learning.   Keep up the great work!

Most of the situations can be prevented, your play is in the right area, just need a few adjustments to shape.

You both play a very good end game.   Pay close attention to the sacrifice at move: 209
