C[Hi!It is the game i think i play well.I hope someone can find the defect for me to improve!Thanks!

Reviewer: Jarkko Lindblad (JL), A Finnish 1kyu, IGS 3d* at the time of the review.

I reviewed for black (as you seemed to be black), but also made comments on some white's moves.

There is a summary at the end of the game.];B[pc]C[JL: the 'polite' move would be R16 instead :)]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qe];W[dj]LB[jc:A]C[JL: Can't say this is necessarily bad but extending at the top around 'A' might be better to reduce the thickness of the black shimari.]
;B[fc];W[ec]C[JL: Very bad as it makes black strong while not helping white as much. This kosumi is good if white already has a pincering stone (hasami) on the top.]
;B[fd];W[df];B[kd]LB[jd:A]C[JL: This stone should be at 'A' or just above it to.Now there is too much room for white to invade and attack the two black stoes. Also the shimari is strong, so no need to play too close to it. Anyhow, black can be happy about the developement so far.]
;W[dm]C[the left seems hard to invade.

JL: White is overconcentrated on the left side. Also both left corners are open for invasion and the side can still be split at D12, so there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Black on the other hand is developing nicely in large scale.]
;B[qk]MA[qe]C[JL: Many moves are possible here, this is ok as well I guess. I think however the it would have been better to play this move high as the marked stone is already low and now the whole black moyo seems a bit low.]
;W[mc]MA[fc][fd]LB[id:A]C[JL: This is both too early and the wrong spot. White should first extend on the bottom where there is lot's of free space left. Also, it would be better to try to attack the marked stones by invading at 'A'. Now white will be under severe attack and that is only fun for black.]
;B[kb]LB[lb:A][lc:B]C[JL: right direction as making the side stronger is important. I would have played at 'A' or 'B' instead though, but can't really critisize this move.]
;W[me];B[kf]LB[lf:A]C[JL: leaning with the keima at 'A' would be more agressive and would make thickness for black and give less room for white to run away. This move is a bit passive.]
;W[mg]C[JL: now white is happy to jump out lightly.];B[ph]C[JL: This move is a bit passive for my taste, but it is hard to find the best move in this position. Anyhow black secures some territory, so it can't be bad.]
;W[ob]LB[lh:A]C[JL: a bad move only helping black to secure the corner assuming black will bother to answer - tenuki of course is proper for black now. White should have instead jumped out at 'A' or something like that to seek safety from the center.]
;B[oc]C[JL: the whole bottom of the board is empty yet black is playing small moves. Neighter player can do much here. Tenuki and playing on the bottom would be best.]
;W[pb];B[nc]LB[qb:A]C[JL: Aji-keshi (move that loses later potential). Locally simple hane at 'A' is better. If you want to attack something, contact moves are to be avoided unless for a good purpouse.]
;W[nb];B[qb];W[nd];B[od]LB[oe:A]C[bad shape!

JL: And what is the reasoning behind this move? This is simpy a bad bad move. A bad shape is not just bad because of inefficiency, but also because it takes away liberties (or future liberties). Anyhow, this move does not accomplish anything. The "shape" move would be 'A' here. That shape appears again and again and is very strong.]
;W[oe];B[qd]C[JL: because of black bad shape this is necessary]
;W[pe];B[pf]LB[pg:A]C[JL: 'A' is better];W[of]C[JL: now this is sente.]
;B[og];W[ng]C[JL: I'm not sure I'd have played here as the eye is already there. However I'm not sure where to play instead. Definately towards the center though.]
;B[nh]LB[oi:A]C[JL: Instead 'A' looks better and faster. Also now white has this peep available later on.]
;W[lb]C[JL: It is a good idea to stabilize this group.];B[lc]
;W[ld]LB[je:B][ka:A]C[JL: bad move. Better to play 'A' and connect, then perhaps peep at 'B' and finally secure the second eye.]
;B[kc];W[mh]C[JL: no reason to make black stronger, ie. a bad move.]
;B[pm]LB[ni:A][nq:B]C[JL: This is a really odd move. There is nothing wrong with the exatension of 'A'. And on the bottom, 'B' seems better than what you played.]
;W[fq]LB[cc:A][ch:B][oq:C]C[it's time for black to invadethe left side?

JL: White should have played the atari black failed to protect against. And no, the whole bottom is still open for either player. There is plenty of scope left in the left, like invasions of 'A' and 'B'. Also white is quite thin all over the side, so nothing there is solid territory. I would probably play simple 'C' now to secure the corner and make the side less interesting for white.]
;B[jp]MA[fq][mh]C[JL: I think this is too loose, especially now that white has the marked stones present. As white I would now invade the bottom right corner. It is hard to build moyo in the center, so corners and sides are more important. Playing this move low would also be better as it would be easier to make territory.]
;W[iq]LB[jr:A]C[JL: This is a classical 'Thank you'-move. Black is more than happy to block at K3. White loses the later possibility to slide at 'A'.]
;B[ip]C[JL: Argh, this is not a good idea. The other block was the right one - it would have made territory, this looks horrible. Now white should play K3. Black can not hope to make territory in the center (at least not much), and all white groups are quite safe, so no targets for attack are present. Thus building a wall here is not smart.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[kp]LB[lq:A]C[JL: I'm not sure if I like the result coming from this move. 'A' was probably best move.]
;B[kq]C[JL: This is the only move, AFAIK.];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[nq];W[hp];B[hr];W[jr]C[JL: empty triangle is better at it takes a liberty from black stones.]
;B[ko]LB[ho:C][io:B][jo:A]C[JL: white should now play 'A', and then either 'B' or 'C' depending on how black plays, IMHO. This is to retain sente white capturing the black stones. There is  aji left for black however. This black move you played is also the only move.]
;W[nr]LB[gq:A]C[JL: it would have been better for white to play 'A' and capture the black stones white making the corner stronger]
;B[or];W[gq];B[ho]C[JL: usually this is the right move, but now I think it is an aji-keshi as the other atari might provide interesting aji later on when you decide to enter the corner.]
;W[gp];B[fg]LB[cc:B][dh:A]C[JL: This is a bad move, and helps the opponent more than you. Now  white secures territory with  'A'. Also if black invades at 'B', harms this invasion the territory black is trying to create in the center.]
;W[eh]C[JL: This leaves more aji in the side if black does not lean on the stone.]
;B[cq]MA[gp][ho]LB[cp:A][mi:C][ni:B]C[here i invade !is it right?

JL:  I think 'A' would have been a better idea now after you exchanged the marked stones if you want to invade the corner. White can now block at 'A' which is troubling. Anyhow, after the bad exchange of the marked stones it is hard to decide how to invade. Good reading skills are now needed and some imagination. I would have instead invaded at 'A'even if my own side were damaged.  or tried to find a place to hit white in the middle. At some point I would also want to play 'B' or 'C' to make nice territory for myself. It is necessary to play one of the two moves soon as white atari of 'B' is quite sente. Whatever black does here, it is definately crirical to get sente to get to play on of the two moves.]
;W[dq]C[JL: white should have blocked the other way];B[cp];W[co]
;B[bo];W[bn];B[cn];W[do];B[bm];W[bp];B[an];W[bq]C[JL: black can be happy. The side is reduced nicely and he may even get the sente he needs.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[bj];W[bi];B[dk];W[ek]LB[cc:A]C[JL: I am not sure of the reasoning behind this fight for either side. For both players getting sente here is very important. White should be able to get it easily. The problem for white is that black 'A' is still possible.]
;B[el];W[dl];B[ej];W[fk]LB[bk:A]C[JL: white might also want to consider 'A'.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[em];W[fm];B[cm]LB[bk:A]C[JL: Better to just connect ar 'A'. White can't play here anyhow, can he?]
;W[fl];B[bk];W[ei]C[JL: bad mistake. Locally a hanging connection on the side is much better.]
;B[ci]LB[cc:A][mi:C][ni:B]C[JL: even though this grabs points, the corner move 'A' is still possible for black, so I'd just play 'B' or 'C'.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[bh];B[cg];W[bg]LB[cf:A]C[JL: white should have played 'A' and scrifice to secure a large corner. After that invading the 3-3 would no more be possible.]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[eg]C[JL: here this move is guzumi - a good bad shape.]
;W[cd];B[fe]MA[ej]C[JL: White lost quite a bit of territory and also black had the nasty marked cutting stone left. The position is very bad for white even though he has sente.]
;W[mj];B[ml]LB[io:A][la:B]C[JL: More interesting move would be for example 'A' to protect against the big cut. Also the atari of 'B' is big and double sente. I'd play it first, then 'A'.]
;W[ni]MA[mj]LB[li:B][oi:A]C[JL: now that the marked stone has been played, this move loses aji of the peep 'A' and creates a bad shap after black peeps at 'B' at some point.]
;B[kl]C[JL: quite small and definately gote. No severity in this move.]
;W[oh];B[pg]C[JL: it is very painful for black to have to play like this]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[qh]LB[pk:A]C[JL: ikken-tobi of 'A' better.];B[pj]
;W[oi];B[qg];W[rh];B[ri]C[JL: the other extension is simpler]
;W[rc];B[qc];W[rb];B[ra];W[rg];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[pa];B[qa]
;W[pd];B[sf];W[io];B[jo];W[in];B[hn];W[im];B[qq]LB[pq:A]C[JL: Why not simple 'A' if playing in this area?]
;W[km];B[lm];W[kn];B[ln];W[jn];B[lp];W[jl];B[ji];W[kk];B[fj]
LB[gi:A]C[JL: white 'A' seems to capture in a loose ladder.]
;W[gj]MA[cj][di][dj][eh][ei]C[JL: black will capture all the marked stones now white white will gain very little.]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[gi];W[gh];B[hi];W[hh];B[ih];W[hj];B[ii];W[ig]

;B[dh];W[lf];B[ke];W[ka]C[JL: kind of odd that white get's to play this move.]
;B[ja];W[la];B[ib]C[JL: this move loses one point in itself as it is not necessary.]
;W[ea];B[da]C[JL doesn't do anything];W[ca];B[fa];W[bb];B[ap]

;W[qo]C[i think the move is unreasonable

JL: of course it is. Black can even ignore it and take one more point if needed.]
;B[qn]LB[aj:B][rn:A]C[JL: even better would be a leg-sweep of 'A' take take away all possible eye-shape, but the best move would be to ignore and play 'B'.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[pn];B[qm];W[po];B[rp];W[ro];B[qp];W[mo];B[lo]
;W[op];B[oq];W[om];B[nn]C[JL: no reason to play here. Just fill the ko.]
;W[on];B[no];W[aj];B[hk];W[gk];B[ai];W[lk];B[aj];W[hl];B[tt]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[JL: End comments:

In fuseki (and later as well) you should think what is big and what is small. And always think of tenuki when your opponent makes a move that does not seem to be severe. In this game you both played many unnecessary moves on top right even though the whole bottom was free for grabs.

You should also get a better sense of shape. Always try to play an efficient move - a move that works, but "moves away" from your other stones to a maximum distance. Shapes you learn if you observe games of stronger players or go through pro-games (or god-forbit, joseki books).

Also all your moves need to have a clear purpouse.

You also need to improve your reading skills. Reading is a foundation to a good game. Playing without reading well is like building a house on sand. To me it looked like this, and shape sense arew the weakest points in your game. Study easy problems and play lots of games and you'll do well.]
