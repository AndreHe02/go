C[KiraBox [11k\\\]: hello
HalfStar [10k\\\]: Good day to you];B[pd]C[[[KB\\\] - I'll throw in my thoughts with this tag.

Hello! I'm Elom Willson, A 3 kyu player from the UK, and I'll tag all my notes, comments and wonders with Elom:

This is an exciting game with many twists and turns. It turns out that some of the small decisions were game-deciding!]
;W[pq];B[cd];W[qf]C[Elom: A lively move :)];B[cp]
(;W[qk]C[Elom: Hmm-- I personally would feel a bit low as white.]
;B[po]C[Elom: The active way.]
(;W[op]
(;B[oo]C[Elom: This move is a tad too bland for me.];W[qn]C[Elom: It became too easy for white to pressure black.]

(;B[pm]C[Elom: I think that this move may be questionable-- it seems that black made white stronger for little gain.]
;W[qm]C[Elom: White is happy to defend.];B[qp];W[qq];B[mp]C[Elom: Interesting move.]
;W[qo]
(;B[ec];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[Elom: We usually play n the other direction, towards white's strength. Since white is stronger on the right than on the top, and because white building a wall on the upper side would ruin the power of the upper left shimari, I think that Q14 is he way to go if you want to attach.

But I *would* choose a different strategy if you ask me.];W[md]
;B[oc];W[lc]C[Elom: A bit slack... P17 is the vital point of this shape.]
;B[ne]C[Elom: I'm sure black is happy to play here :) but still, it is dissapointing that black has lost all hope of making points on the upper side]

(;W[qc]C[Elom: I feel white lost sense of direction here.];B[nb]
;W[mc];B[jc]LB[nb:1][mc:2][jc:3]C[Elom: Very good sequence, just like how the pros do it  ;)]
;W[qd];B[mf]C[Elom: I feel, that you are ahead now.]
(;W[ke]C[Elom: Too plain, white seems to be relaxng in an urgent situation!]

(;B[kd]C[Elom: This move seems to put black in trouble.];W[le]

(;B[me]C[Elom: Seems like the best idea (To attack white) but white has a deadly counter.]

(;W[ld];B[je];W[kg];B[jf];W[lg]
(;B[cj]C[Elom: A risky choice, and even if I were to play here, I would definately take the star point here since like this black too low on the left, in my humle opinion.]

(;W[eq]
(;B[gq]C[[[KB\\\] - I wanted to avoid building a wall facing my stones on the right.

Elom: Well, I'm not sure that the lower side is interesting for both sides, since neither side  can make much territory due to the presence of the opponent. Maybe the pincer  isn't correct  here?]
;W[eo]LB[do:A]C[Elom: A might be possible.];B[dn]
(;W[cr]C[Elom: Is white sure?];B[dq]
(;W[dr]C[Elom: Again, I would lean first.];B[ep];W[fp];B[dp]
;W[fq]C[[Elom: White lost the opportunity to strengthen herself/himself.]
;B[hp]LB[en:A][ho:B]C[Elom: A or B seems to be the only way for white now.]
;W[iq]C[Elom: It looks like an overplay.];B[ip];W[jq];B[gr]

(;W[fr]LB[gp:A]C[Is it possible to  jump out into the center? With a move like A, for example?]
;B[en]C[Elom: I feel that white was outplayed on the lower side :)]
;W[fn]
(;B[fm];W[gn];B[gm];W[gp]C[Elom: Now black has allowed white to play here.]

(;B[hn]C[Elom: Black sacrifices too much here. This move is not worth 30 points.]
;W[hq]C[Elom: Black loses around 30 points.];B[in]C[Elom: The wall here  seems  useless at the moment-- and black lost 30 points for it.]

(;W[ho]C[Elom: ?];B[io];W[go]C[Elom: ? ???]
(;B[pe]C[Elom: Too timid-- it's better to choose a move with more power, more drive, more life, more kiai (fighting spirit).]

(;W[qe]C[Elom: White is making a similar mistake-- this move is lifeless.]
;B[mh]C[[[KB\\\] - I wasn't sure how to handle this group. I didn't think it would have trouble with eyes but had trouble thinking it had enough strength for an invasion on the right side.

Elom: While white's group cannot be killed, since out is as of yet eyeless, you could first attack it to gain strength and muscle might. This move is in the right direction, however, I would place it one point to the right-- like this, black can be cut, making things unecessarily risky.]

(;W[ph]C[Elom: A very risky move. The upper side white stones will become even weaker!]

(;B[og]C[Elom: Hmm, to me, it seems this move is too narrow in it's focus.]
;W[ji]C[Elom: White is happy to play here.];B[ih]C[Elom: Nice point.]

(;W[jh];B[hh]C[Elom: Good, dynamic response, showing why white's last move is questionable.]
;W[hc]C[[KB\\\] - I am terrible at dealing with invasions. I lose most of my points this way.

Elom: There is absolutely no way white can live here. I've seen many invasions, but... This is WBaduk style! First of all, white has a weak group in the center which has been left undefended, so it seems like black will win the game easily, since she/he has more territory than white in the unlikely event  of the central eyeless dragon surviving.

Fortunately, severely dealing with my opponent's invasions is one of the trademarks of my Go :D all because I started playing the cosmic style from day one.]
;B[jb]C[Elom: Calm and nice, the central white stones are nearly dead as well now.]

(;W[gd]
(;B[ff]C[Elom: You're intending to kill white, right? Black need not worry about white moving into his strength ;)]

(;W[ce];B[de]C[Elom: Black should just extend and play at the starpoint. The hane invites unnecessary complications.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bc];B[cf]C[Elom: Black should play on the starpoint instead. Like this, it is easy for white to make life.]
;W[eb]
(;B[bb]LB[fb:A]C[Elom: You panicked. There is no other way than blocking at A.]
;W[cb];B[ac];W[fc]C[Elom: A huge move, now the game is reversed.]
;B[fd]C[Elom: Doesn't  accomplish much.]
(;W[gb]C[Elom: Too safe. White is not reading enough before making a move.]
;B[fa]C[Elom: Whoa! A timesuji perhaps.];W[ga];B[dd]C[Elom: Not sente.]

(;W[ba]
(;B[ab];W[da];B[ge];W[id];B[jd];W[he];B[hf]
(;W[kb]C[Elom: It looks innocent, but it's actually self-destruction! White is wide open!]

(;B[ka]C[Elom: It seems to me that A is superior in removing eye shape. This move looks harmless, but actually, black nearly threw away the game. Finesse can sometimes be vital.]
;W[la];B[ja];W[mb]C[Elom: White gets a free eye.];B[ob];W[kc]

(;B[ie]C[Elom: Unecess... Well, In any case, this could have been the losing move.]

(;W[ik]C[Elom: Unecess... Well, I'm sure you understand what I mean. In any case, this could have been the losing move.\](;W[ik\]C[Elom: White managed to not only miraculously survive, but garner a ten-point lead!]
;B[gk]LB[li:A]C[Elom: Would something around A still effective?]
;W[il]
(;B[hl]C[Elom: You don't have to follow white here...];W[im]
;B[hm];W[pl]C[Elom: Big. White can play safely now, since she/he is ahead.]

(;B[ko]C[Elom: Doesn't defend against the cut at A.]
(;W[nq]C[Elom: It is only possible to extend in the other direction.]
;B[mq];W[no];B[nn]
(;W[np];B[mn];W[on]C[Elom: I would shift my attention towards the upper side group, and squeeze it first while solidifying the centre-- White should be playing safely now-- before coming back here.]
;B[om];W[pn];B[pg];W[qg];B[li]
(;W[ki]LB[ii:A]C[Elom: Maybe white could play something like A instead.]
;B[kl];W[kk];B[lk];W[kj];B[lj];W[jl];B[km]
(;W[ni];B[nh];W[oh];B[oi]C[Elom: Overplay.];W[nj];B[pi];W[qh]
;B[mr]C[Elom: Brilliant point! This move was huge, every point black made in the center has now been defended. The game has reached a crucial phase, I'm on the edge of my seat.]
;W[nr]
(;B[ms]C[Elom: It could have been a game-losing mistake!];W[kp]
;B[lp]
(;W[jm]C[Elom: Actually helps black ;)]
(;B[jn]C[Elom: !];W[mo];B[lo];W[jp]C[Elom: !!];B[fb]C[[KB\\\] - I didn't read carefully enough and thought I could poke out an eye.

Elom: White is overly-thick here, like a garrison.];W[ea];B[ic]

(;W[ok]C[Elom: Losing move.];B[nl];W[do];B[co];W[fo];B[cn]LB[bq:A]
C[Elom: A is the only feasible defense here. And, black really doesn't need to defend here.]
;W[hr]LB[kr:A]C[Elom: Again, only A is playable here.];B[hb]
;W[ha];B[ib];W[jg]LB[hj:A][pc:B][bq:C]C[Elom: A is sente, B and C are bigger.]
;B[ig]LB[hj:A]C[Elom: A is better.];W[hk];B[hj];W[ij];B[hi]
;W[bq];B[bp];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[cq];W[br];B[ns];W[os]LB[or:A]
C[Elom: A is better, but I expect that both players were in time trouble long ago.]
;B[or];W[pr];B[ps];W[qs];B[os];W[oq]C[Elom: Whoops!];B[qb]C[Elom: Good.]
;W[pc]
(;B[pb]C[KB\\\] - Too timid.

Elom: Yeah, but the game was irreversible at this point.];W[rb]

;B[qa];W[aa];B[ad]C[Elom: Wow! What a game.

Elom: I feel that both players slightly lost sense of direction of play at certain points in the game, specifically corncerning the judgement of the strength of groups and "urgent points before big points", leading to some dramatic instances!

Elom: After many twists and turns, black finally won by 4.5 points (partly due to your better endgame in this match.

I hope this helps even a little!
