C[Hello and thank you for reviewing. I played black in this game.

I added some questions - maybe you can have a look at them, too. :)


***********

Hi,

thanks for submitting your game for review and giving me the possibility to learn from it as well. Reviewing was really a great pleasure and I hope there are also some pieces of advice that you'll find useful.

Please note that everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt - after all I'm just 1-kyu myself and far from understanding anything about go. ;-) Anyway, feel free to contact me in case you have any further questions, remarks or different opinions.

Though you requested a review for Black, I had a look at the moves of both players as it's easier for me this way, too.
I also tried my best to answer your questions properly and gave some variations along the way - be sure not to miss them.

My comments during the game record are preceded by "fey:" to distinguish them from yours; I also addded a brief summary at the end of the game.

Sorry that reviewing took a little longer, I really tried my best but was awfully busy with school. 

Best wishes,

Nadja Sommerfeld
(2ndtry@gmx.de)];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[qh]C[fey: Good, the more valuable direction.]
;W[qn]
(;B[oo]C[Should I have followed B O4 - W S4 - B R3 - W Q8 - B F3 instead ?
With his overstretched stones it didnt feel right to let him off so easily.

fey: This move is certainly unconventional but follows the right idea.
Unfortunately I guess it doesn't really achieve your goal of taking advantage of White's wide extension, as White can simply protect his three-space extension with his next move and is left with aji in the corner for later.

If you are in a fighting mood (no need to fear a fight here, as you are locally stronger on the right side), you could try splitting White directly with R8 - I added a variation on that move.

But the sequence you propose in your comment doesn't seem bad for you, too. See the second var.

The problem with P5 is that it kinda overlaps with Q4 - both 5-5 and 4-4 strive for influence, but your weakness in the corner still remains and P5 doesn't influence the edge much, either.]

(;W[om]TR[qk]C[fey: This leaves lots of aji around the marked point, maybe White could try playing as in the var.]
;B[jq]C[fey: Because of the presence of P5, this move feels a little off balance and should be propably played on the fourth line, but this might be a matter of taste above all.

An extension seems appropriate and necessary, but you have to agree that P5 would be better placed at O4 now. :)

Just try tewari: Would you follow K3 up with P5? I bet you wouldn't... ;)]
;W[dj];B[rp]C[fey: This move doesn't feel that urgent now, though I understand why you like to play it (it's the balance between K3 and P5-Q4 again - S4 evens it somehow). 

But after all this move isn't a big threat against White's right-side group which is pretty light. S4 is therefore just a big gote move, and that means White has time to tenuki to a big point like K17 - this way his moyo would be way larger than yours and he'd prevent the double-wing formation formed by P17-R16-R12 as well.

I guess that attacking at F17 or simply extending to K17 would be best for Black here.]
;W[mp];B[fq]C[fey: I like your idea of dogding away here first before attacking N4 later.]

(;W[oq]C[fey: If White just treats this as a kikashi (forcing move) and turns to D6 then, P3 is playable. 
D6 has the virtue of 
a) keeping White's moyo intact and
b) aiming at Black's weak spot at H3 (might come in handy for a counterattack while running with N4.)

N4 needn't be protected right away - it's a light stone and can't be attacked that easily, too.]
;B[pq];W[nq]C[fey: So White decides to make his group heavy instead of treating P3 as the forcing move it was.
This way he achieves just the opposite of his original aim of strenghtening his N4 stone: The group becomes heavier, clumsier, but can't be sacrificed anymore.
White has just provided you with a nice target to attack and hardly will have time to switch to D6 or K17 anymore.]
;B[mo];W[kp];B[nm];W[ol];B[ip]C[fey: Nice sequence up to here, you are taking good advantage of White's weak group.]
;W[on];B[no];W[lo];B[lr]TR[cn][jc][jd][fc]C[fey: To my mind this move isn't really important now - White's territory here is small and you'd only be happy if he'd have to live here in gote somewhen.

K17, D5 or F17 look big instead.];W[lq];B[kr];W[kn]C[fey: A little slow; L7 or L8 are the usual moves.]
;B[cn]C[fey: Good! :)]
(;W[cq]C[fey: In spite of its passive look this is a fighting move following the basic idea of playing all-out after having secured a position in the corner.
It's certainly an interesting idea for White to play here, but I think my choice would have been F4 as in the var.]
;B[eo];W[do];B[dn];W[en];B[em]C[fey: I'm not sure whether you really should play this atari - what about D8 instead?
One proverb states: "From a crosscut, extend" and D8 is kind of an extension. It's often better to keep both ataris in reserve than to decide on one right away.]
;W[fn];B[dl]TR[em]C[fey: The marked stone isn't really needed in this position, it has just provided White with more options.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[gp];W[go]
(;B[dr]C[I got paranoid about the W G3 cut and thought D2 would protect.

fey: See the var. on G3.]
(;W[cg]TR[fj]C[fey: This looks a little strange, at least it doesn't put much pressure on Black. 
Perhaps White could try playing the marked point as in the var.]
;B[ej];W[di];B[ml]TR[qh][qd][oc][hl][gl][ek]SQ[ej]C[fey: As you write later, you seem to have misread here. If you decide on E9, you have to follow it up somehow, maybe with one of the marked points.
Otherwise E10 becomes just a wasted, useless stone and plus your group is in for a hard time when White attacks.

N8 itself doesn't seem like the biggest move, too - it reduces some white influence, ok, but honestly White can't really expect much at the bottom center because it is open at three (or at least two) sides, and even if he somehow manages to build something there, it's likely that 10 points will be the absolute maximum.

K17 is still, along with F17, a very big move, it forms an ideal double-wing formation with the marked stones.

All in all you shouldn't get too paranoid about White's potential, at least not in situations like these where your own possibilities for expansion are as big as White's, if not even bigger.]
;W[ek]C[fey: Ouch... :(
It's pretty hard to find a good move for Black here, but maybe living fast and simple is the best thing to do here - every attempt to flee will just give White a powerful wall. Just try to keep things as open as you can, painful as living in such a narrow space ist. Refer to the var.]

(;B[gl]C[Misread, didn't see white cutting.];W[fm];B[el];W[fl]
;B[dk];W[fk];B[cj];W[ci];B[bk];W[jd]C[What to do about the moyo ?

fey: I'd propose G16 here, please see the variation I added a couple of moves earlier (on move 50), the result there looks pretty similar to the game.

After all White's moyo just looks pretty intimidating, but in fact it's White's only considerable territory and can on top of that be reduced. 

The only thing that doesn't seem to work here are direct attacks on the upper left corner which are either bound to come un der heavy attack or give White an even moyo.]
;B[dq];W[bo];B[bp]TR[fd][ji][mc]C[I searched for an answer in sente here.

fey: Just play B6. In endgame terms, it's quite big with C5 as a follow-up (C2 is your sente, too.).
At this stage of the game, no move against the corner is really sente, though. The focus should be White's big moyo - instead of answering D3 he should consider one of the marked moves.]
;W[co];B[bn];W[an];B[bm];W[cr]C[fey: White is kind here - C2 is worth several points, ok, but it's simply an endgame move.]
;B[oh]C[fey: A nice, big and patient move which I like.

Follow this up with something like the G16 invasion and you have a reasonable game going.]
;W[oj];B[hp]C[Still paranoid + searched for a secure entry in whites moyo.
G8 looks like a peep now - perhaps I could put it to use.

fey: Your mistake in thinking seems to be that you consider the bottom center white moyo - it isn't! Even if it becomes territory somehow, it will be really small compared to White's moyo stretching from the upper left corner. It's way more urgent to invade the top now and prevent White from playing the way he did with his next move.

About you G3-cut-paranoia: Simply sacrificing still works, there's absolutely no way your group can die.]
;W[mc]C[fey: Invading becomes harder and harder, but you have to do something about White's moyo. Possibly G16 might still work, or you could think about J16 or D17 if nothing else works.]
;B[jm]TR[kn]C[fey: This attack is a nice idea (remember how I criticised White's marked move as slow? Now here's why I didn't like it ;) ).

The plan should be to drive White out, reduce the center part of his moyo and then invade the corner.]
;W[km];B[jl];W[kl]TR[gl][jm][jl]C[Once more with B K9 ?
I wanted to keep whites group seperate and as weak as possible.

fey: K9 looks reasonable (mind the fact that you still have to secure a connection for your marked stones), but maybe K10 would be a little faster and effective.]

(;B[mj]C[fey: This move emphasises a stronger attack on White's right side group and kind of discards the possibility of pressuring the white group stretching from the bottom in a way that destroys White's potential in the center (shown in the var. on K10).

N10 looks like a strong attack, though. I guess White really should add a move to the R10 group as soon as he can.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[jk];B[kj]C[L10 doesn't look good at all. But I needed some preparation before invading.

fey: L10 is ok as a forcing move, but I guess it isn't really a good kikashi as White can answer with the move I propose in the var.

Probably we have to accept that the attack on White is over for the moment and that Black can't profit from it for now.

Kyu players almost ever attack too soon and too directly - that's what some pro said once and I believe it's one of the best proverbs ever.
Of course speed and pressure are important when attacking, but attacking just for attacking's sake will bring you no gain.
In cases like this, it's better to discard the battlefield temporarily and return when there's profit to be made from attack. 
You have to be patient to master this strategy, but it'll sure pay off - if you once felt the pleasure of killing an enemy group which he thought was save in the endgame, you'll know what I mean. :D

This principle applied to your game:

An invasion into White's moyo is urgent and big.
The attack on White's group doesn't look like you could profit from it now, but probably White's weakness will prove useful later to counterattack with your own invasion group.
Any further attack would only kill that potential and should therefore be left out.]

(;W[kk]C[fey: White is kind again.
This move is a little uninspired, K6 looks way better.];B[id]
C[I guessed standard invasions such as C17, D18 or F17 just weren't enough.


fey: Correct judgement. All the points you name are simply going to help White, so I like your idea ot attaching at J16, which is a pretty common and effective sabaki strategy.

The G16 I proposed earlier might still work, too, but J16 looks like a good way to invade in any case.]
;W[ic]
(;B[hc]C[fey:  The crosscut is often an option here, too, but I guess I'd have chosen the hane, too.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[jc]C[Now I really felt screwed...
My next move searched for complication.];B[dc]C[fey: Have you ever read this small book called "Sabaki - How to manage weak stones"? The technique you adopt here is excactly one of its main themes - "create a battle nearby - you will win one of them".
Good!

(Just for completeness' sake, the other two principles are: 
(1) Look for counterattacking possibilities when running with a weak group; if there aren't any, don't try to run.
(2) If you can't flee and the invading stones is in a valuable area, try to live fast.)

It's really a great book that teaches you a new technique in a bare hour.]

C[fey: Let's take a look at the board now:

Black managed tp invade the upper side successfully and even kept sente (!!). In return, White's outside influence grew and has to be reduced as fast as possible.

My counting is far from being good but I'll hazard a guess anyway;

Black:

Upper left: 8 points
Upper right: 19 points
Left side: 4 points
Bottom: 15 points
Lower right: 6 points
==========
Total: 52 points + some prospective points around Black's shimari in the upper right


White:

Upper left: 32 points
Lower left: 11 points
Upper side: 4 points
Rigt side: 7 points
Komi: 0.5 points
+ potential in the center
==========
Total: 54.5 points + some points in the center that White is surely going to make

So the game is quite close as long as Black keeps the majority of the center neutral.]

(;B[jf]C[fey: This move is too heavy and just serves to present a target for White to attack. Those two stones it attempts to rescue aren't that important.

Actually it's quite difficult to find a good starting point for a reduction of White's moyo. 

I've tried some of my initial thoughts in the var.
(Var. 1 - Some kind of counterattack
Var. 2 - Reduction via sente endgame plays and forcing moves)]
;W[kf];B[ib]C[I didnt like the shape of my group at all...

fey: Understandable, but if so, B18 is the move to play. It's one of the biggest plays on the board, and a double sente move, too.

But I still guess you have to challenge White to a fight inside his moyo here - simply giving up the J15 stones won't suffice to win the game. Maybe J11 is still worth a try, or you might ply something like the L13 hane.]
;W[je];B[if]C[fey: Too heavy again - saving those two stones only increases your loss.]
;W[kg]
(;B[ij]C[fey: What about K11 instead? I've tried some vars that all in all don't give Black a bad result.]
;W[jj];B[hm];W[ii];B[ik];W[hi]C[fey: I'd call the result of this exchange game over for Black :(]
;B[jb]C[How about B M17 instead ?

fey: Again - B18 first, then M17 looks like a nice tesuji for you indeed.]
;W[lc]
(;B[rl]TR[ni]C[fey: This move is good if you plan to use it as a sacrifice stone and force from the outside afterwards, but you could also consider playing from the outside right on as in the variation - this might be reasonable because White has still aji around the marked point and it's probably unlikely that you are going to kill the group.]
;W[ro]
(;B[rj]C[fey: This doesn't seem to work well.  You should play like in the variation to prevent sacrificing more than necessary.]
;W[ri];B[rk];W[qi];B[rh]C[I wanted to threaten with my inside group as much as possible, before discarding it. Didn't turn out as a success. :/

fey: Mh, I guess you were just a little too generous here... :/]
;W[si];B[qo];W[rn];B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[ql];B[rm];W[qm];B[so]
;W[sn];B[pi];W[pj]C[fey: The final result isn't too bad for you anyways, though the sacrifice stones weren't absolutely necessary.]
;B[kh];W[jh];B[ki];W[ji];B[mh];W[nf];B[gj];W[gi];B[pf]C[fey: Absolutely necessary and big.]
;W[oe];B[le];W[ke];B[nd];W[me];B[md];W[ld];B[ne];W[mf];B[of]
TR[cs][bi][bb]C[fey: A nice endgame sequence, though B18 and B11 are probably bigger, along with the C1 hane.]

[bd][ad][mb][na]C[fey: The final margin by which you lost seems quite big, but actually we can blame the single strategic mistake of not invading White's moyo in  the right way: You had some splendid opportunities (for example on move 60) to turn the game in your favor and you played well and took good advantage of White's weak groups.

Try to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your moves: Never chase a weak group without gaining - It'll lose you lots of aji.
Plan your reductions and invasions with a little look in the future - can you live inside without giving your opponent too much influence or preserve the possibility of reducing iot somehow.
Can you just smoothly reduce or is a daring invasion necessary? It's important to learn to count properly to make this decision.

Practice to calculate the value of a move at a cetairn point of the game - any strong player won't answer an endgame move right in the middle game when the important points are to be made elsewhere. (cf. the lower left corner)

Plus, the will to sacrifice a strong point of yours and will help you to get stronger, but don't overdo it. The S8 stones were unnecessary sacrifices - remember the proverb: "Play from the outside first.", so you won't lose stones by playing inside right on. Often enough your opponent will be forced to defend inside anyways.

Maybe you are just about the right strenght to enjoy replaying pro games (a matter of taste, though, there are also some who don't seem to gain from doing this) - I experienced that this influences the intuition, timing of your moves, shape and strategic vision in a positive way and teaches you what is commonly called "good style" as a nice plus.
Check gobase.org for a giant repository of pro games.

*****

I hope it doesn't seem as if I critisised too much - I always tend to be kinda wordy in my reviews and naturally there's more to comment on the mistakes than on the good plays. But anyways most of my comments should be taken as suggestions and "betters" or simply as my personal opinion which might seem utterly stupid to a stronger player.
I'd be glad if there were also some pointers you found useful and -as always- I'll be keen to hear which points of the review you liked and where I could improve something.

(;B[ql]TR[qh][qq][rl][on]C[fey: With the marked stone present, this is also a common technique in this situation.

The three options I'd consider as White here are marked with a triangle.

a) The san-san invasion.
This can be a useful move if, for example, the shimari in the upper right corner is White which hems the development of every black moyo that might occur on the right side.
In this case, though, it doesn't look appropriate because the wall Black gets combines just too nicely with his other stones and only burdens White with R10 as a weak group.

b) The link-up at S8.
This move is often right in situations where White is as outnumbered as here and needs to strengthen himself quickly. It looks, though a little passive, like a good option here.

c) The ikken tobi at P6.
By tackling the Q4 hoshi first R8 is weakened and White aims to attack it afterwards.
Possibly this is the most common answer to B R8, and it looks good here, too. White gets quite a secury position on the right, but it's rather narrow and Black keeps sente, so we can call this result even, if not a little better for Black.]

Black has sente to play any of the marked points, so there really is no need to be dissatisfied here. :)]
