C[>Hello, I am Mark Fyffe (bucky 1k on KGS).  I play black in this game.
>I do not normally play a slow game or play as black, so this game was quite interesting to play.
>Other than some ugly misreads, the second of which cost me any hope of winning the game,
>I think I did well. Please help me to find a better way to keep my stones alive more securely.

After the first 40 moves you already had a lost game, I think you should pay more attention to the opening and try to make your stones secure from an early stage.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dq];W[pp];B[co];W[jq];B[pm]C[This is a strange move, usually you would play wide approaches like this if you were afraid to be pincered, but here it seems to me there is nothing to be afraid of..]
;W[nc]
(;B[dj]C[I think it is dubious to ignore the white move at O17]
;W[qf];B[oe];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[pg]C[this move is inefficient, you have spent far too many stones to kill the single white stone on the side. I think it is better to play on a larger scale.]
;W[qk]C[This is a clever move, treating the W stone above lightly.]

;W[ob];B[od];W[rc]
(;B[fc];W[cf];B[ld]C[this move is insubstantial in my opinion, it does not really threaten anything or build anything. The upper side is still open so it will not become your territory, and the right side W can play R13 to live big at any time.]
;W[gq]
(;B[qq]C[>where does this corner go wrong. i thought i could cut and live, is this possible?

It goes wrong when you hane at S4, but I don't really think the 3-3 invasion is appropriate even if you played it right.]

(;B[qj]C[>another clumsy play. how can I play this better and still keep the center?

You can always press at Q12 instead, but I am not sure R10 is that bad, if you play the press, then it will be easy for W to tenuki to reduce your center and just secure his lead. R10 is a play looking for complications, which is not neccessarily bad in an unfavourable situation.]

maybe you can try to sacrifice in such a way that you stop the N16 cut in sente?
However, W could have cut at N16 directly instead, see variations.]

I'd say W leads 10pt and B has very bad aji -- I expect W to win at this point. I think you are missing that almost all the endgame plays are sente for W so the B territory is smaller than it looks.]
