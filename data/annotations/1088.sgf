C[berni: Dear reviewer!
We have played this game at the 14. Erlanger Go Turnier.
I'm black and would like to know, why I've lost the game.

My opponent is also interessted in your comments --I will send him a copy--, so I would ask you to comment his moves too.

Thank you, berni

;B[jd];W[fd];B[cj];W[cm];B[cg];W[nq];B[pn];W[ef];B[lp]C[Instead of M4 I would prefer to stabilize the left group with a move like E10.]

;W[nm];B[pl];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[nr]C[O2 P1 is a bad exchange, better just S5.]
;B[os];W[lr]C[as black mentiones later there is still a cut at O4.]
;B[qp]C[S4 instead of R4 seems to be a clean kill :-)];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[sq];B[mk];W[jn];B[ll];W[dh];B[ch];W[dj];B[cd]C[before a move like C16 creating some cutting points with
the sequence D11, E11, C11 seems ok.];W[cc];B[dd];W[ed]C[the exchange D16 E16 is very bad for black. It stabilizes white a lot und is really bad shape for black. Bumping his head against a wall. B17 instead of D17 is better.]
;B[ik]C[Tenuki is virtually impossible after the bad D16 E16 exchange. Look at the black shape if white now plays B16.]
;W[km]C[B16 is better.];B[lm];W[jl];B[jk]C[These two exchanges are helping black a lot and do nothing good for white.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri]C[I don't see why black has to sacrifice this stone. Better just S9.]
;W[rh];B[rk];W[si];B[pi];W[ph];B[nf]C[Instead of O14 now it would be a good time to invade the lower left. For example at D3 or C3.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[og];B[ng];W[oi];B[nh];W[nk];B[li]C[berni: I played this and the next few moves with the intension to cut at O4 (bL5,wK5,bO4).]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[ml];B[lk];W[mo];B[il]C[berni: Here I thought, that the cut is not possible anymore, so I concentrated on other regions of the board.

comment: Why not? But still invading the LL is better. :-)]

;W[rr]C[S2? I don't see a move to kill the corner.];B[lo]C[berni: meanwhile, i've seen that the cut is still possible (see later in the game)]
