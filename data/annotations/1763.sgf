;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj]C[Very interesting move (on our level) After this move my goal was to ignore the fluence of this stone. (Avoid ladder and dont let build up such big moyo)]
;W[dj]C[You could also invade at the right. Black then cannot get a double wing formation. Maybe you should do this already at this point.]
;B[jd];W[qj]C[I hear that this is the counter move of K10 but I dont know how to use it.

You simply extend the stone to above or below, which is Miai. If black sets here, he gets a big Moyo due to the double wing in the upper right, which is well supported by the center stone.]
;B[fp];W[dn];B[ql]
(;W[qf]C[Safer one point below. You do not want to get much territory, but quickly make the group as safe as necessary.]

(;B[pf]C[This helps white.];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]C[I was happy of this sequence. Now I try to find an invasion to the bottom ...]

(;W[pn]C[Not really good. A point deeper is locally better. However the lower side is more urgent. You can use a split move there or squeeze the black stone.]
;B[ol]C[See, now you do not get a base easily.];W[nq]C[Good.]
;B[oo];W[qq]C[Good.];B[qp]C[This is the wrong direction. Black gets overconcentrated.]
;W[pq];B[lq]C[Not good. You can sramble blacks territory while securing yourself.]

(;W[mp]C[See variation.];B[jp];W[on]C[Maybe an overplay. But if you think you know what you do ...]
;B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[nm];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo]C[I felt that P3 is a big aji but i did not see what is the cost.

P3 is no danger.];W[hp]C[Tough attack.];B[jn]C[My plan was coming here after H4 :(.

Tht would only drive black into the direction, he wants to go anyway.]
;W[hn];B[or]C[Aji Keshi.];W[oq];B[mq];W[np];B[nr];W[pr]
(;B[hq]C[This is almost never a good move.];W[gq];B[gp];W[iq]
;B[hr];W[ip];B[ir];W[jq];B[kp]
(;W[lp]C[What is this? Empty triangle for no value. Aji Keshi.]
;B[kq];W[jr];B[fq];W[ll];B[jl];W[ko]C[Unnecessary.];B[jo];W[kn]
C[Also too slow. The lower middle group must be safed first.]
;B[gn]C[Now you got yourself in trouble.];W[hm];B[in]C[Nonsense.]

(;W[go]C[Just connect.];B[fo];W[ho];B[dl]C[Wrong. Overplay.]

(;W[gr]C[Not a good attack.];B[fr];W[is];B[gs];W[em];B[dr]
(;W[cr]C[Does not work. And does not threaten black.];B[gm]
;W[gl];B[co];W[do];B[dq]
(;W[fn]C[I thought better to give up the corner and get some strategical advance. Maybe it was not a good choise.

I think it was right. See the variation. You suddenly have no more troubles.]
;B[cp]
(;W[cq]C[I force this only to better isolate the corner and maybe get a sente at the end. (and it was).

You can do that more easily. See variation.];B[cn];W[cm];B[bm]
;W[cl];B[bq];W[br];B[bp];W[bl];B[bn];W[aq];B[cs];W[am];B[bs]

(;W[hd]C[I was thinking a lot where to put this stone?

Right so. But the result may not be lukewarm like this. This neither attacks the black group below, or does it secure the corner, nor is a good extension.]
;B[jf]C[This looks ideal for Black, doesn't it? Secure the upper side, connect the lower stones.]
;W[jh]C[Good try.];B[lk];W[ml];B[kh];W[oj]C[This is no thread against the black group on the right. And therefore, you simply let black connect.]

(;B[rk]C[Out of focus.];W[kk];B[kl];W[lj];B[jk];W[kj];B[ji]
;W[hf];B[dh];W[hj]C[Neutral point.]
(;B[hi]C[Again the wrong focus. Also locally wrong, since black might get cut during the fight.]
;W[gi];B[gh]C[Black must be careful!];W[hh];B[fi]
(;W[gj]C[Why not simply take?];B[hg];W[ih];B[gg]
(;W[ii]C[it sd be J13?

See variation.];B[ig]C[Now he gets cut.];W[ki];B[kr]
(;W[ms]C[Mistake! Simply connect.];B[ls];W[js]C[I do all the cut in the center because to kill this group. Now I let It to make two eye. Why?  Where is the mistake? should I accept the ko fight now?

Of course, there is nothing you can loose!];B[mr];W[km];B[il]

(;W[cg]C[Not good. Black can now invade the corner.];B[fd]C[Or do this in preperation.]

(;W[fc]C[As I said, this is almost never a good move.

However. It is tough to find a good move now. See variations.]

;B[di];W[db];B[gc];W[cj];B[bi]
(;W[mb]C[I made a lot of bad moves till now to shorten the invasition but finally black get all the territory. Please point out what is the best strategie to keep the upper left corner as big as possibile?^

You alredy choose the best method. However the loss on the upper side is big. You should have secured the corner before.

This is not the correct invasion point. it is too deep.];B[nc]
C[I am unsure, if this is the right defense in view of the white Aji in the upper left.]
