C[Hartz: Hi, I am just 4k at KGS so I will try to do my best but dont take my advice as certain always.]
;B[qp]C[P12 on move 148 was a mistake i think for white but other then that could i have killed white if I went T12 or S10. Aside from those, please give me any other tips that I could've done to this 5kyu player.
Broody [14k\]: :D thx
Broody [14k\]: hi
yni1935 [5k\]: hi];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[nq];W[gc]C[yni1935 [5k\]: no problem]
;B[do]C[hartz:

In this position I would have played around r10 or in the left side around c10. Black d5 is prone to a pincer attack and that pincer works beautifully with white upper corner.]
;W[gq]C[Hartz: 

I think a pincer is far better for white, his position  is too low.]
;B[dl];W[qe]C[Hartz:

Same idea in the right side now.];B[oe]C[Hartz:
 I would have pincered without a question. When you have a possibility for attacking and make territory at the same time that is usually the best move.

P15 is not very good, imho, because it dont attack white very much and while try to make thickness at top, it would be difficult to make territory there because g17 white stone.]
;W[pf];B[qh]C[Hartz:

This is the move I would have played before.];W[mc];B[qd]C[Hartz:

Good move. It take the corner AND attacks white stones.];W[og]
;B[qf]C[Hartz:

This is an overplay. Now the black stone at r12 is weak. The idea should be to reinforce r12 while taking territory at the right side and attacking white stones. A possibility would be p11 or simply r9.]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[pe];B[re];W[rg];B[ph];W[pg];B[od];W[pd];B[qc]
;W[qk]C[Hartz:

Now the roles of attacker and defender have changed and white is attacking when he should be running.
Black corner is not enough compensation.];B[rh];W[sg];B[pj]
C[Hartz:

Good move, white has two weak groups while black only one. But white is far stronger than black so usually he is stronger at fights.]
;W[qn];B[pl];W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[pn]C[Hartz:

This is not the right move. The idea is to reinforce the black weak stones while attacking but q6 leaves many weakness behind. I like O11 for this position.]
;W[pk]C[Hartz:

And white takes the chance.];B[oj];W[ok];B[mi];W[mg];B[nf];W[ng]
;B[mf]C[Hartz:

I  think m15 would be better, but n14 is in the right direction.]
;W[lg]C[Hartz:

Black has two options here: attack the center stones, get strengh and then attack the white n17 stone. Or just the opposite, attack n17 and later continue against the center group. This technic is called "leaning attack".]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[kb];B[jd];W[jb];B[df]C[Hartz:

Not bad, quite big but while in fights it is not good to play at another part of the board.]
;W[md]C[Hartz:

So white take the iniciative.];B[lf];W[kg];B[di]C[Hartz:

Same commentary as before. The game is at the fights between the weak groups at right side.]
;W[nk]C[Hartz:

And white again plays on the right area.];B[mj];W[ce]
(;B[ee]C[Hartz:

I dont like this move, it dont serve for anything. c14 is MUCH bigger. Even it is possible to invade at e17. Look at the variation.]
;W[bg];B[cf];W[bf];B[ed];W[ec];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[ql];B[jj]
C[Hartz: I think this is a very important move. It helps black weak group WHILE attacking white]
;W[sh]C[Hartz:

White feels the pressure and try to connect.];B[kq]C[Hartz:

Big mistake, you have put a lot of stones just for attacking white and you have a very good chance to kill his big group and now you just play  at another side ... I dont understand why]
;W[pm];B[rj]C[Hartz:

This is the proper move for keeping white split.];W[ri];B[qj]
;W[sj];B[sk];W[rk];B[si]C[Hartz:

White has managed to get a ko skillfully. But this is a good ko for black because it is very big and he dont risk anything.]
;W[nj];B[ni];W[sj];B[ic];W[sl]C[Hartz:

The ko is very big so white dont answer it. The question now is if white can live there.]
;B[ib]
(;W[mb]C[Hartz: 

I think this move is too tight, i would have played at p18]
;B[ob];W[le];B[kd];W[ke];B[me]C[Hartz:

This is black only chance.];W[kf];B[bi]C[Hartz: 

Were you so sure white was dead at top? If so you have a good eye for live&dead questions :)]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[ge];B[hf]C[Hartz:

I think h13 is better, but it is quite good.];W[gf];B[hh]C[Hartz:

When you CAN it is better to jump ahead as here. The question is when you can and when you cant.]
;W[hg];B[ig];W[gg];B[jh];W[li];B[lj];W[ki];B[kj];W[ji];B[ii]
;W[ci];B[cj];W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[kl];W[hk];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj]
C[Hartz: 

Again jumping at e10 is better.];W[hn]
(;B[ho];W[go]C[Hartz: 

I think that if you want to kill white you should cut at g6 now. Look at variation2]

(;B[hm]C[Hartz:

h7 looks like a tesuji but dont work for cutting here.];W[gm]
;B[gp]C[Hartz:

Simply an overplay, too many weaknesses.];W[hp];B[fp];W[io]
;B[fq];W[lo]C[Hartz:

White has achived his objetive, he is now the attacker.];B[mn]
;W[lm]C[yni1935 [5k\]: sorry
Broody [14k\]: np :D];B[ll];W[mm];B[km];W[ln];B[jn];W[jo];B[jl]
;W[jk];B[qi];W[si];B[kn];W[ko];B[im]C[Hartz:

White could have killed black. Look at variation.]
(;W[oh]C[Hartz:

BIG mistake for white.];B[oi];W[hq];B[eq];W[dp];B[eo];W[bp]
;B[bn];W[dr];B[br]C[Hartz: I think this is an overplay. It is usually better first reduce the eye space from outside, c5, b5, for example, and after that, if there is a chance go inside for the killing.



Broody [14k\]: hmmm i placed my piece 20 seconds ago... bit laggy]
;W[bq];B[ar];W[fr];B[er];W[es]C[Hartz: White has connected so black b2 stones are a gift for white.

FINAL COMMENTARY

You have played quite well at this game but you must improve your attacking tactics and opening style but your life&death strengh is good.

I am sure that you are far stronger than 14k probably around 6k-7k]
