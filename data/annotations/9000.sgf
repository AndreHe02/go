C[Dear reviewer!

This is a game I played in a recent tournament as black. I think I was in the lead after the opening, but the middle game did not went well for me and I lost.

Any comments on my or my opponents play are welcome.

Thank you for your review!

Tomas


Hi, I'm Andrew and I'll be reviewing your game. I'm about 1 dan or 2 dan, depending on the day. In this game there are many moves of white's that I'd like to comment on in addition to yours. I hope everything is altogether helpful for you. If you still have questions after the review, I'd be glad to answer them at ajnz1234@gmail.com.

Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[po]TR[qk][pq]C[In this game, you said that you felt in the lead at the beginning but lost it later. I think the overall reason for this is that you weren't quite aggresive enough about punishing white's overplays.

This move by white is the first overplay, a common mistake. You have the marked stones already waiting there to attack, so there is no way for white to get a good result.]
;B[np]C[This is the correct move.];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr]LB[qp:A]
C[Here white overplays again. This must be at "A". I think this move must be some kind of trick play, hoping for black to cut at "B".]
(;B[qp]C[This properly punishes white.];W[rq];B[pp];W[pr];B[or]
;W[qs]
(;B[rp]C[This move is just slightly on the small side. With or without it, however, your result here is very good.]
;W[iq]
(;B[kq]C[This is small. There are only about 10 points here, and with 17 your group is already very strong.]
;W[io]C[I think white starts to be ahead here. This means that you will need to be especially agressive when white later invades on the right side.]
;B[jd];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi]
(;B[ok];W[qc]C[White has the wrong idea here. He is creating another group when his 22-24-26 group is still weak. This gives you an opportunity.]
;B[re];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[ph];W[nf]
(;B[le];W[mc]
(;B[me]C[Connecting is very good, but in this case doing it in sente is important because you want to get another move on the white group below.]
;W[oh];B[pi];W[qh];B[pj];W[mh];B[pg];W[og]
(;B[kg];W[rf];B[mg]LB[rj:A]C[This appears to take white's eye away, but attaching only makes white stronger. A would be a better way to take an eye away (it would also be a big move point-wise, since A is a sente eye for white).]
;W[mi];B[mk];W[ki];B[cn]
(;W[dl];B[cq]C[This is a very good plan. At the end of the sequence white loses all his territory here and becomes overconcentrated.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[fq];W[go];B[fp]
;W[fo]
(;B[fm]C[This is much too close to white's thickness. This will only increase white's territory and give you another weak group to handle.]
(;W[ln]C[This is an overplay for white. This gives you an opportunity to counterattack.]
;B[ko]C[A very keen move.];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[jm];W[ll]

;B[qo];W[nk]
(;B[lm];W[nj]C[After this point I don't think there is much more you could have done. White has territory on the left, the bottom, the right/center, the lower right corner, the top right corner, and the top left, and you only have territory in the bottom left corner and the right side. You do a good job of stealing the upper left corner territory from white later, but it's not big enough to make up the difference.

Again, I think the main reason you got behind was that you weren't aggresive enough attack-wise. Also, a few moves like 17 and 19 were slow.

If I may, I would like to recommend the book "Attack and Defense" from Kiseido. You may have already read it. I think it is the perfect book for players of your level who are approaching dan-level. It discusses much about different attacking strategies (leaning attacks, capping moves,  splitting attacks) and also has very helpful explanations of thickness and how it is used.


I hope my review has been satisfactory. I stop the comments here at move 106 because, in general, it is the first one hundred moves that are worth studying. The endgame is usually a matter of reading, and is best improved by doing tsumego. If you still have any questions, please ask me at ajnz1234@gmail.com.

Wish you the best,
