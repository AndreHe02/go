C[Hi Patrick,
I am a 3K player on IGS, and I think I have a lot to learn myself - so take my comments with caution.

I have reviewed this game and it is an interesting one. You read the board better and won, but you had some basic mistakes inside.

On the tactical level, you left a big group unprotected for many moves and even after that you did not protect it correctly; You were luck that you opponent did not take advantage of it. I would recommend to you to strengthen you skills in this area by solving more life-and-death problems.

On the strategic level, your opening was sound, apart from the top left where you played sumbissively and let White invade your territory. Here again, on the tactical level White failed to read and attack you back. Before you attack you have to make sure your weaknesses are covered.

All in all you played better and your win is justified.

I hope the review will help you - feel free to ask questions as you like.

;W[ql];B[mp];W[mc];B[qi]C[A: I would take advantage of the fact that the White R8 group is not settled yet and extend to R10. The game move lets White attack back and settle hig group too easily.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[qj]C[Now White has no wrries for the moment, and the Black group is too crowded.]
;B[cj];W[po];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[cn];B[cf];W[hq];B[jq]C[This move leaves something to be desired.
White encloses the corner, with good chances to grab mor territory with moves like H5. Black on the other hand had his group already secured - but he did not increase his territory by much, and there is a weak point around M3 which White can invade later on. I would consider invading C3 immdiatelly, and later reduce White's influces on the outside.]
;W[dq];B[cc]C[Is this a weak move? should i have expanded on the top side instead?

Yes, This is too submissive to play like this. you should have played around F17, possibly G17. White could carely live by invading into C17, and Black outside influence  is good compensation. Note the difference between what happened in the lower left versus the upper left: White had only 2 White stones and selected to extend before protecting the corner, while Black had 3 Black stones and selected to protect first... Who gained more?]
;W[jc];B[hc]C[I think this is a bit of overplay on Black's side - let me explain in coming steps.]
;W[fc]C[Good invasion by White.];B[he]C[Is this a bad way of attacking the f16 stone?

This is too loose. G16 would be much better. In this case White would regard F17 as a probe,   steal some points and stabilize his territory on the top right by trying to link to this stone.]
;W[fe];B[fg]C[Again, G14 is preferred...];W[gf];B[je]C[Look what happens here. White is in fact strong: He can link his stones with H18. In this case, it is the Black which will have some troubles. So white should try to split the 3 Back stones from thier allies (Q13 group).]
;W[hg]C[White here feels under pressure and let Black attack him, strengthen himself and taking territory on the left. I would press back by G13, and then play around L16 to start attacking the Black 3 stones.]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[ff];W[ge];B[if];W[ig];B[jg];W[ii]C[Bad move. What would you do if White plys J16 instead? There is a miai of H16 and J15!]
;B[gd]C[Good - starting to close the door.];W[fd];B[jh]C[But now you should have continued with J16 before White plays there...]
;W[hh]C[But he did not... and this is repeated for the next moves as well.]

;W[dc];B[lc]C[I try to attack k17 and m17 but don't know how to follow up

Before you attack, you must make sure you do not have weaknesses yourself. If you do not, you will end up being attacked. The J16 weakness is too big to ignore.]
;W[ld]C[Linking underneath (M18) would give White more territory than in the game.]

;B[jn];W[jm];B[jo]C[Note that the Black Q13 group could be killed at any time for the next moves (starting with White playing S13)- I will refer to it later.
A basic principles in GO is that first priority should be given to make sure your groups are alive...]

;W[jj];B[mf];W[me];B[ke]C[is this a bad move?

There are much bigger moves. Apart from protetcing at S13, look at J2 for example. The K13 group is not under immediate danger at the moment, because it has a safety move at N11.]
