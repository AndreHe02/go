C[Durak: Dear reviewer, even though I won this game, I don't feel like I deserved to win. The thing that really troubles me about this game is that, even though my opponent clearly made some mistakes locally, he ended up with a better position anyway. So where did he have a better direction of play than me? Where was his global positioning better than mine? Thank you for taking the time to review this game. I will indicate some possibilities and comments myself.

In hindsight, I made quite some comments myself. I hope that's ok. In any case it may help you see what my problem is.]

(;W[kc]C[I prefer moves in the corners]
(;B[pk];W[ci];B[nd]C[D: I dont really get this move.

It is less unusual than your L17.

Both players seem to build big moyos, so it is interesting to peserve the center controle here.]
(;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[? strange attachement.];W[qo];B[rp]C[D: this is a mistake by black. At least locally it is. You can check this at www.eidogo.com.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[po];B[qr];W[oq];B[pr];W[np]C[D: The ladder favours me]
;B[de]C[D: here I have to capture the stone at p4 because this move is a ladder breaker. So he gets to play twice in my corner. But all things considered I still feel that I made the better exchange.]
;W[oo]TR[po][qo][np][pp][oq]C[D: the triangled group is very strong and destroys much of the influence my opponent had before. He started with a stone on takamoku (5-4 point) in the lower right, so he wanted to play with a lot of influence, but clearly I totally disrupted this play. So I think black messed up the lower right corner.

all you write is correct. Well done!];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]
;B[jj]C[D: to me this seems like another mistake. Joseki says you should defend the group at c16. Now I know joseki isn't always the best thing globally. But surely it is not good to leave c16 without a base? On the other hand black has developed a large moyo in the upper right, so maybe I'm wrong and this really is the best move.

I think blacks play is bad here.]
(;W[cf]C[D: I tried to take away black's base, not to lead an attack immediatly but to create potential.]
;B[ff]C[D: At this point I felt I had an advantage when I was playing the game. But now I'm not so sure anymore. White really only has the lower left corner to make much territory. And black has a large moyo in the upper right. I wonder why black didnt just play q17 or something like that. That would claim a large corner plus it would make it harder to invade the large moyo between r15 and q9. But then again it may be overconcentrated to play q17.

white clearly leads here, there is nothing to be afraid of.

Q17 is just a bad move, because it makes o16 look silly. Black might try o17 to close the corner, but that leave aji for w to destroy the Q13 area.]
;W[iq]LB[gd:B][op:A]C[D: Is this good or should it be on the other side?

This is your first bad move.
It is to close to the strong shape at A to be efficient. A proverb says: "Stay away from thicknes"

Apart from that w realy wants to add a move on the upper side. This would prepare to attack black and saveguard L17.]
;B[go]C[D: see variation.]
(;W[dn]C[D: all things considered I think it's necessary to play on this side (see variations). Does that make j3 a bad move?

j3 is bad for different reasons - to close to thickness];B[mq]
C[black helps white to knock some sense into j3];W[io];B[kp]
;W[ro];B[rq];W[hm]C[good, the ponuki does not need help.];B[dr]
TR[go][gq]C[D: can i do something better here? Because this one move seems to suddenly stabilise the two marked stones. Suddenly my attack is over, and my own stones at j3 are weak.]

no, w was fine all the time.];W[mo];B[or];W[nq];B[mr];W[jm]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[lj]TR[mm][ln][mn]C[D: somehow this seems like another mistake by my opponent. It allows me to capture the marked stones and link my groups together, making them safe beyond any attack.

Both white groups are almost alive. capturing might not even be the biggest move on the board.]
;W[nl]
(;B[nm];W[ol];B[om]
(;W[pm]C[this move is clearly a mistake! And a realy big one!]
;B[pl];W[ml];B[qm];W[pn];B[oi]C[D: by this point my opponent has made several mistakes but still I dont really feel I'm winning. In fact over the next couple of moves it will become clear that I am losing. My main question is: am I already losing here? Or is it only because I messed up the next couple of moves that I lost my advantage?]
(;W[ke]C[D: this is probably wrong. Better at c8.

Better at G16.];B[lf];W[kf]C[D: If the previous move wasn't wrong, this one definitely is. Black's severe attack at d8 proves it.]
;B[dl]
(;W[me]LB[gm:A]C[D: persisting in stupidity... I should have gone for c7.

this is indeed wrong, you underestimate the weaknes of A - now b turns weak into strong. Even localy this does not seem to be the biggest move, a corner invasion looks bigger.]

;B[ei]
(;W[ck]C[D: desperate move.];B[bm];W[bn];B[be]LB[gm:A]C[D: at this point the match should have been over. Black has some good territory on the right and left and I really dont' have any territory left. How did this happen? Just a few moves ago I thought I was doing well.

You started wiht the big blunder at Q7, so black got nice sente moves, which he was never supposed to get. Then you refused to treat A as a weak group ang got nothing on your side. You are just too friendly here. :)]

time for a sumary:

A Make sure to profit from your opponent weak groups in one way or another! Dont let them become strong for free.

Because ot the weak group at A i dont think black will find the time to invade the left side, so I counted 23 P for w there. Wtih Komi w has a litte more than 40 Points.

So black needs 32 Points from his right side (C) if we dont asume thet B or A will get severly attacked. For fun i marked 32 Points round C.

W has two options to stay in the game after the blunder at Q7. He can eather invade th upper right corner, make points there and preserve the lead in Points. However this seems a little unlikely. I prever to protect the top with a calm move at D. This way white can attack B to reduce and get points at the top too. Maybe even A can be in dagern sonn this way.]
