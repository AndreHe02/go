;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[ec]C[Although this is joseki, it is too tight for this stage of the game. It forces Black to strengthen his position.]
;B[kc];W[nq]LB[dg:A]C[It is more usual to strengthen the corner, for example at A.]
;B[cf];W[ce];B[ch];W[ck];B[cj];W[dk]C[This pressure makes Black too heavy, which is good for White.]
;B[qn]C[White now needs to invade the right side, so that Black does not manage to mark out more than half of the board as prospective territory.]
;W[fd]C[Too tight. Too small a move, compared with the right side]
;B[gc];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[bf];W[be];B[ei];W[jp];B[pi]C[This is the result I was warning against. White has one and a half sides, and Black has two sides and a piece of another. Both control two corners.]
;W[nc]C[An overplay. This invasion should not succeed.];B[mb]
LB[oc:A]C[Black should have protected the corner at A.];W[nb]
LB[me:A]C[Too tight. This will allow Black to confine the White invasion closely. Running out to the middle at A is much better.]
;B[nd];W[mc]LB[qc:A]C[White cannot make life in this direction. A stone at A can certainly live, either linking with the other White stones or sacrificing them for a larger invasion on the right side.]
;B[lb];W[md];B[ne];W[pb];B[qc];W[pc];B[od];W[le];B[ke];W[kd]
LB[lg:A]C[It is more important to break free into the center than to take one point along a border. Play at A.]
;B[jd];W[lc];B[jb];W[je];B[ld];W[kf];B[kd];W[me];B[jf];W[ie]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[lg];W[kg];B[mg];W[nf];B[of];W[ng];B[mi];W[kh]
;B[qb];W[mh]C[Black made a mistake, and White took proper advantage of it.]
;B[nh];W[lh];B[oh];W[og];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf];W[qh];B[qi];W[ph]
C[Unnecessary.];B[ni];W[nn];B[ol];W[om];B[pl];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk]
;B[ml];W[mm];B[ll];W[lk];B[pm];W[nm];B[np];W[nj]C[White cannot make a significant invasion or capture here. Blocking the Black invasion along the bottom is better.]
;B[ok];W[li];B[oj];W[mj];B[oi];W[kl];B[mq];W[mp];B[oq];W[nr]
TR[mq]C[This White group cannot survive. Trying to keep it allive forces Black to strengthen his wall starting from the marked stone.]
;B[mr];W[or];B[pr];W[ps];B[ns];W[qr];B[pq];W[no];B[os]TR[mq]
[mr][ns]C[White now has to deal with an invasion based on the marked Black wall.]
;W[qq]C[This group has no hope.];B[qp];W[lp];B[kq];W[lq];B[lr]
;W[jq];B[kp];W[jr];B[kr];W[lm];B[cq]C[Good timing. This Black invasion will force White to build a wall, but that wall will not make any new territory for White.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bq]LB[co:B][bp:A]C[An error. Black should have played at A, threatening to move out of the corner at B.]
;W[dr];B[bp];W[bo];B[cr];W[er]LB[ar:A]C[White now threatens to kill the Black group by a play at A.]
;B[ar]LB[bs:A]C[Black would like to make two eyes with a play at A. White must kill the Black group by playing there first.]
;W[ko];B[hd];W[he];B[ge];W[id]C[This endgame move is too small, worth only two points if it succeeds. The unfinished wall building in the center of the board is much more important.]
;B[ic];W[gd]LB[fk:A][gk:B]C[Black needs to invade the center, perhaps at A, before White can block it off. White needs to block it off, at A or perhaps B, before Black can invade.]
;B[hc];W[gf]C[There are two weak White groups that Black can pressure, winning two stones.]
;B[fe];W[ee]C[Right. White cannot afford to save the two stones in atari.]
;B[ed];W[if];B[ff];W[fg];B[eg];W[fd];B[gg]C[Did Black not notice the atari?]
;W[gd];B[fh]LB[fk:A]C[Again, Black needs to invade at A.];W[hg]
C[White does not need to defend here, and should block off the Black invasion route to the bottom instead.]
;B[ff];W[gh];B[fg];W[gj]C[Finally, a middle-of-the-board move to block Black. White is clearly ahead now. What remains to fight is the Black group in the lower left corner, which can still live or die at a move, and the endgame details along the border walls.]
;B[eb]C[Black should save the corner group, but failing that, the sente moves at the center left take precedence over moves like this which give up the initiative.]
;W[db];B[ea];W[da];B[fb];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[gi]LB[fj:A]TR[gh]
C[Black's thrust through the White line not only gains territory, but forces White to respond so that Black retains the initiative (sente). At this point, White should abandon the marked stone in favor of walling Black in at A to preserve the large White territory below.]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[hk]C[White has saved a few points in the center but let Black invade a much larger area below.]
;W[gk]LB[fk:A]C[White needs to connect up his wall at A rather than pressing too close to Black.]
;B[fk];W[fj]LB[fl:A][gl:B]C[White should not try to capture this Black stone. Connect around the outside at A instead. If Black then tries to cut at B, then White can atari the Black stone.]
;B[ej];W[ek]C[The group of three White stones is in serious danger. Connecting it to other White stones is more important than chasing the Black stone.]
;B[fl];W[gl]LB[dk:1][gk:2][hk:4][fl:3]C[There are two weak White groups (1 and 2) and two weak Black groups (3 and 4) attacking each other in semeai. They cannot all live. White should not have let Black get this opportunity.]
;B[em];W[fi]LB[cm:A]C[No. Connect at A first. then connect the other weak White group to the walls around it. By attacking Black here, White gives up a liberty and leaves both White groups open to attack.]
;B[cm]C[Now the only way to save White's group of three stones is to kill Black, who has more liberties]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[dj];B[ci];W[di];B[eh];W[bl];B[bm];W[dh];B[aj]
;W[fe];B[cg];W[ak]C[White creates a ko. The semeai on the left is nearly even, with both Black and White having four outside liberties. This battle to the death will decide the outcome of the game.]
;B[ai];W[af];B[bk];W[al]C[Fine.];B[cl]TR[bk]C[White can capture the marked stone and start a long and difficult ko fight. White is at a disadvantage in the ko fight, since Black can win it outright by capturing three white stones, while White has to win the ko, attack the Black group, win the ko again, attack again, and then win the ko again in order to finally capture the Black group. This is called a three-step ko.]
;W[hl]C[No, no, a thousand times no. When you capture these four stones you give up the ko and lose the semeai, and you are giving away about 50 points, compared with winning the semeai yourself. There are nine White stones and nineteen Black stones in contention, along with the territory they sit on, or about 56 points in all. In addition, if Black wins the semeai, he also wins the lower left corner, worth 30 points.]
;B[am]LB[co:B][bs:A]C[In order to kill the Black corner group, White would have to play at both A and B. Actually, whichever White plays, Black plays the other, either making eyes at A or capturing one stone at B and connecting to the group above.]
;W[gn]C[This is the kind of wall-building you should have done earlier.]
;B[co];W[do];B[cn]C[Now the endgame, finishing details of walls.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[fm];B[el];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[fn];W[fo];B[gm]
;W[hm];B[fm];W[ho]C[Not really necessary.];B[ag];W[ae];B[cc]

;W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[op];W[qo]LB[pn:A]C[No. Connect at A.];B[pn]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[rn];W[rq];B[so];W[sq];B[qs];W[sg];B[sf]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[oc]C[Worth only one point, and gives up sente.]

;W[na];B[jo]LB[lo:A]C[Threatens double atari at A.];W[jn]LB[kn:A]
[ln:B][lo:C][mo:D]C[No. Any of A, B, C, or D defends against the double atari.]
;B[io];W[in]LB[ip:A]C[White should defend against the double atari.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[lo];W[mo]LB[kn:A]TR[ko]C[Having gotten into this much trouble, White should save the marked stone by playing at A, and let Black have these three stones. The actual move saves the three stones, but also lets Black save three stones and continue the attack. Thus it gains nothing.]
