C[Hello, this was a very close game throughout, any ideas/ suggestions on strategy  or other things very welcome
Many thanks,
neil Mclean

Hi my name is Floris Barthel and I am a Dutch 3d. I hope my review helps. I would love to hear your feedback.]
;B[qd];W[dq];B[dc];W[qp];B[co];W[ep];B[ci]C[i wasnt sure about this, just feels right, sort of mini chinese, that shusaku era go used to play.

It's ok]
(;W[cl]C[I don't like this move. The meaning is unclear. Therefore I would like to tenuki with black.]

(;B[cq]C[is this right?];W[cr];B[br]C[This is wrong.];W[cp]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[White's shape is too strong];B[dr];W[er];B[cs]
;W[do]TR[cl]C[seems standard trade...

Even though the marked white stone is much more effective one space higher, black cannot be satisfied.White is very strong on the outside.]
;B[nq];W[lq]C[I tried to avoid the pincer by playing O3 now it looks out of place

The pincer is good.]
(;B[no]C[Im not sure of these far kakari joseki's]
(;W[lo]
(;B[qn]C[I would prefer to make a slighter stronger shape.]
;W[op];B[np];W[pn]C[Good]
(;B[pm]C[This is wrong. Black is only cutting himself into pieces.]
;W[on];B[pr];W[qm]C[This is very painful.];B[ql];W[rm];B[pl]
;W[rl];B[rk];W[rn];B[mn]SQ[pm]C[This result I dont like at all.

Indeed :) The fatal mistake was the marked hane. In such a shape, you must almost always cut on the inside. Hane on the outside implies you are sacrificing the other group.]
;W[ip]
(;B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[pq];B[qr];W[qk];B[qj];W[fd]C[i didnt even check the ladder didnt work, but its right to take it off most times?

possible to play c15/c14 first, mybe that would have been better.]

(;B[pk];W[ce]C[---> stats Neosai];B[de];W[df];B[cf]TR[fd][df]
C[i fealt i had to cross cut and  decide what to do after.

Eeh? Not possible :) When you see such a shape you must almost always go right in between to cut the stones up.]

(;B[hc];W[gc]C[h17 worked and got a forced white, but if i was to play i would mybe play w p16 instead.]
;B[ac];W[db];B[bb];W[cb];B[oc];W[ff]C[now black f14 would have looked very big]

(;B[fi]C[This is now where I have difficultly finding where to play

My groups seems safe and I want to play at bottom left to reduce white.
 F11 I feel or e11 is needed to get black some power to reduce in this area,
your thoughts?

The shape you make here is too weak, and white does the common sense thing: cut. Ok I will stop here. If you have any more questions/comment please email me at floris.barthel@inter.nl.net.]

it seems a fight is unavoidable, but should be good for black]

h18 is slow but big, perhaps q13 area instead?];W[pg]C[*Neosai*: 5k :D
looking back on the game, i think allowing q13 is the losing move, or the winning move for white]
