C[I'm a newcomer to Go, so I'm not quite sure what to pose as key issues.
Two things do stand out as failures on my part: my inability to successfully
finish what appeared to be a severe attack (say from move 23 to 43, and that
I was not able to exploit the strong center influence I gained in the
opening and early middle (starting at about move 120 to the end). Again,
these are what stand out to me, as a rank beginner. If you feel that there
are more important issues to concentrate upon, I'll welcome the guidance.

Thanks very much,

;B[oc]LB[nd:a][cj:b][pj:c][fq:d]C[I feel this is weak. If answering white's  last move, "a" is better, but now I think  you should play a big move like "b",  "c" or "d". (DR)]
;W[nd]MA[oc][od]C[now the DIAMOND stone is too close to  the xx wall. the wite stones on the  outside are better placed.]
