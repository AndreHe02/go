C[Dear Sensei,

In this game I'm playing as black. The game ended pretty soon. My opponent thought his groups were unsecure and the game wasn't still decided, but I thought his position was superior to mine. There were several strategical decisions I wasn't sure about and I'd like to get comments on them.

Please don't mind that the game was played pretty quickly, I've spent time on the game afterwards.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
(;B[dj]C[I don't even know if this move is good, I don't get any matches from my pro game database.

Niklaus: Searching the gobase.org database, I could find two games with that position, both from the early thirties. The reason is probably that preventing a white sanrensei is not very urgent at this point.
 I'll show some more common alternatives in the variations.]
;W[po];B[pl]C[I thought this could work together with the Q16 stone, even if it's pretty far.

Niklaus: Seems fine by me, a very common pincer];W[qp];B[qq]
C[The right answer? The corner got low and if not enclosured, at least it had little space for extending.

Niklaus: Yes, looks like the only move to me. R4 is quite unusual, the normal idea is to jump out into the center and keep the attachment at 3-3 in reserve.]
;W[np]C[Niklaus: You might consider cutting here]
(;B[nq]
(;W[qm]C[Niklaus: Another strange move, strengthening the black stone without getting much in return.]
;B[ql];W[qf]C[Should I attack or invade white's group? For example, r6?

Niklaus: Don't invade! it's way too early for that, as white can easily run out into the center.]

(;B[qh]C[I don't like this move generally but this should work with the q8 r8 stones, right?

Niklaus: I do like this move generally :) Apart from tenuki this seems like the only option here to me.]
;W[nc]C[Niklaus: The usual idea is to attach at either O16 or Q14. See the variations.]

(;B[oc]C[Again confusion. What about p15?]
(;W[qc]C[Niklaus: Another move I've never seen before :)];B[qd]
;W[rd]C[Niklaus: White should be punished for not answering P17]

(;B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[nd];W[mc]C[But this looks fine to me.]
;B[pf]C[Niklaus: looks a bit overconcentrated to me. Black spent a lot of stones that don't do a lot of work. I prefer white's result.]
;W[jd];B[cn];W[gq]
(;B[fd]C[I thought I couldn't let white take the whole upper side. It always confuses me which side to approach from.
I thought that low approach would be bad because of k16 (see variation).]
;W[dg]C[Niklaus: This is one space too far.];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec]
;W[cb]C[Niklaus: D13 at D14 here makes more sense]
(;B[ic]C[I decide the open skirt at d18 is ok for now.

Niklaus: Sure, open skirt is fine. However I don't like J17. It unnecessarily strengthens white. You will very rarely see this move (kosumi on 3rd line to a stone on the 4th) in a high level game. See also the 2nd variation at move 41.]
;W[jc];B[id]
(;W[ci];B[cj]C[Niklaus: Again this move. White can forget about an invasion now. Also, the position on top is not really strengthened.]

(;W[co]C[Is this a good move by white? It looks as if it actually helps me. Is white's corner now secure?]
;B[dn]C[Niklaus: No, Ws corner is still open to invasion/reduction at 3-3]

(;W[kq]
(;B[iq]C[I thought my own territory was pretty secure so I decided to make some kind of reduction.
Would a shoulder hit to g3 and l3 be ok?

Niklaus: I don't like it. You just create a weak group.];W[jp]
;B[hp];W[gp];B[ho];W[ip];B[hq];W[pj];B[nk]C[Was I too ambitious?]
;W[oi];B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[ng];B[mg];W[pg]C[There is a fight here but I'm mostly interested in help with fuseki.]
;B[qg];W[of];B[ph];W[pe];B[oh];W[ni];B[mf];W[ne];B[rf];W[me]
;B[nf];W[og]C[Huge reduction, I resign.
Do you think I had any hope? If I hadn't resigned, what could I have done? Maybe to do something about white's upper left corner?

Thank you for all your comments.]
(;B[oe]C[Niklaus: There's still a ko here! I agree with your opponent, you should not have resigned yet. Upper left as well as lower left are not solid territorry yet. You also have a lot of influence to the center, so you can expect to make some territorry there.]
