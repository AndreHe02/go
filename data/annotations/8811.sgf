C[    Hello !
 I'm Tilwen, Black in this game. I won that game (by resignation, White lost a big group at the end because he attacked my weak one before defending his own), but at the end we both had a feeling as if a lot of global or strategical things has just gone above us and we didn't have a lue about it. More clearly I think we both missed big points during the game and we were just faced with the consequences of that. Well that's maybe not much more clear.
  The point is I would like to have advices about the global strategy, when did I go in the wrong area of the goban, how did I get a weak group when I was attacking, and ideas like that :) . I hope you'll be able to help me !

  I put some questions further in the game.

-Hi, I'm SkyOverSea on KGS and Tygem. 2d on KGS and 4d on Tygem right now. If you'd like to talk more about it, can email me or try to message me on the servers. The game actually was pretty even, I feel like at the end if white didn't make the mistake of dying aha, it could go either way but I think you had the advantage. I think you need to look more at the tradeoffs at each point of play, knowing you can live by playing a move so you tenuki or creating a weak group so you can extend one stone further. These aren't things you do to get ahead most of the time especially not during fuseki. You don't want to live small during the opening. Hope it was helpful, there's more comments than there is variations cause I think it had more to do with thinking this game.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dq];B[do];W[op]LB[cq:A][mq:B]C[This is kind of unusual but why not :)

-I think this gives you the choice of how you want to play it. It's mainly preference still I think. When you're stronger though, I'm sure there's certain moves which would seem better given where the stones are right now.]
(;B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[gq]LB[de:A][ck:B]C[-This actually isn't joseki by w. I think he's confusing this with the 3-4 pincer joseki. You should look at this more like where else can I play after c9? I would probably play c9 to keep it simple but after he plays wherever, I think I still have a nice move. I have the bottom right or an extension along the left depending on where w chooses to play after.

Something else most important, after you play C9, what was the trade off? You have a stable base on the left and w has a bottom which can easily be broken up. This is more at fault with w playing the joseki wrong.]
(;B[de]C[Here i decided to go in the upper left corner to keep sente a little bit, I didn't want white E3 if i played C9, and I was thinking I still had B2 to defend my group.

-I don't see how you didn't think you would get pincered. I would definitely pincer here. I don't know why white would E3 but I know he has a weakness there. Another thing, yes, you won't be dying anytime soon in the bottom left but having to play b2 as a life-saving move isn't something you actually want to do. Also, just a little thing, I might have approached at c15 instead given your group on botom. I don't think this itself is a bad move though.]
;W[cg]LB[cc:A][be:B]C[But here he pincered me and I really don't like the result of this joseki ...

-I think you can still be fine, you chose the wrong move after this for sure though.]

;B[ec];W[bg];B[ef];W[dg]LB[ck:B][cl:C][mq:A]C[It seems like black gets nothing except sente, and white gets a solid group... Here I was thinking a move around C9 was too close of white's strength, so I went in the lower right corner.

-Indeed, the only reason black is okay in this joseki is because he has sente. I think this turned out bad for you.  I think you need to extend on left now.]
(;B[mq];W[cl]C[So white went on attacking me here.

- This is a weird way to attack but yeah.];B[br]C[-This is the most obvious move and the thing is while it's kind of big, things could have been better for you. I think that's the most important part.]
;W[kq]C[I think this move and the following ones are just too good for black, and if i keep sente I'll play D2.

-Weird move by w. This pincer is usually needed to play directly. Almost always.]
;B[oq];W[qo];B[pp];W[po];B[np];W[oo];B[pj]C[I decided to keep pressure on that group before defending on the lower right, I don't know if this choice was good.

-Defending what on the lower right? This is a good move for sure. Going great for you right now.]
;W[no];B[mo];W[lp]LB[mn:B][mp:A]C[He peeped me, but i was thinking : my corner is alive, if i get N6 he'll have to worry.

-This is exactly the point where you changed the game. This train of thought is exactly what you need to change probably. It happens a lot, there's different reasons to tenuki or ignore something. This is a bad way to ignore something. Sometimes the flow of stones is more important. Staying connected and attacking is much more important. Right now you have a corner, a stone at Q10 which looks great and w has a weak group. You only stand to gain, well that is until you made a weak group. Why make a weak group on purpose?]
(;B[mn];W[mp];B[nq]C[-W cuts you off in sente. Very very painful.]
;W[ol]C[Here is the beginning of the things i didn't master at all. At this moment I'm attacking, my two stones are quite weak, but middle is open, and his group needs to go out. But at the end of it I got just a very ugly shape and white a quite nice one ...

-Because it's hard to attack when your stones are weak as well. Everything fell from the moment you got cut off.]
;B[ml];W[oj];B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[ql];B[rk];W[kn];B[nk];W[ok]
;B[mi]C[Are these two moves in  the right direction ?

-I think these moves are fine, yeah.];W[oi];B[ph];W[nc]LB[ob:B]
[nd:A][ng:D][oh:C]
(;B[nd]C[I wanted to keep white separated, having in mind it would get points for me later

-Good thought to keep white seperated. But terrible way to do it. This was a great chance to have w have two weak groups but O16 lets white settle on top. A empty part of the board. In short, you're helping strengthen W with this move as well.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[kc];B[rp]C[Slow move ?

-Yeah, it's slow but w still needs to live/run out. Maybe playing P12 is still better than this and make white live in gote.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[oh];B[og]C[Too greedy ? Probably wite's shape is good now and i should defend my middle group, but a white move on Q13 would hurt ...

-w playing q13 would be terrible for you so either hane or extend is needed.]
;W[ng];B[of];W[lk]C[And here began the ugly shape ...];B[mk]
;W[mh];B[lj]C[-I would say this is still good shape given what you have. It's a very attackable group though.]
;W[kl];B[jj];W[dr]LB[cn:B][fo:A]C[So I was left with two kind of weak groups, when did I fail to defend ? (I mean, when become attacking less sente than defend ?)

-Well attacking with a weak group, when the attack was done, you still had a weak group there so that was the problem. I would rather settle with C6 or something so you don't have two groups that can be attacked.]
(;B[fo];W[bs];B[aq];W[cn];B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[dp];B[cm];W[dn]
;B[dm];W[en];B[em]C[Maybe this exchange is not good for me, as white is already strong on the left side ?

-This is bad for you except W decided to tenuki. So ended up great for you. W is taking the bottom while you cant really take the left anyways.]
;W[bl];B[eo]C[But he let me that ...];W[ik];B[fm]C[Taking the stones would have been better probably ...

-Yes, taking the stones would have been better.];W[kh]C[Now my group feels really bad ... I managed to link it but maybe it shouldn't, white is pretty strong everywhere here.]
;B[ii];W[gj];B[hh];W[gc]C[How about E13 instead ?];B[fe];W[gg]

;B[hj];W[gn];B[fn];W[fh]C[These moves seems not very big.];B[gk]
;W[go];B[lf]C[Now I felt a bit safer, I had no clue of what could hapen to the upper left corner, and his group is kind of weak, even if Q7 or so lives.]
