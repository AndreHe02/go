Hi, this is Scartol (I was black). I think a 14.5 loss to someone 2 stones above me is fine, but I'd like to know what I could have done to win. There was a lot of fighting in this game, and while I didn't lose any big groups, I obviously lost and so didn't fight as well as I could have. Thanks for your help!

Tristan: I will do my best for you.];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[ec]
C[Tristan: You see moves like this in pro games, aiming to prevent Black making a shimari, but at kyu level I think it would be safer to play in an empty corner, since White can easily fall a long way behind if she does not know what she is doing.]
;B[df]LB[gc:A][de:B]C[Tristan: Black might have considered a pincer such as G17 in view of the support lent by Q16 (point A). The move you played should be fine, though. The Shusaku Kosumi (point B) looks good to me, too.]
;W[cc]
(;B[cj]C[I chose to go for territory rather than strength. A mistake?

Tristan: You should play at B17 and divide up the corner with White (see variation). Your move is too loose, allowing White to take a big chunk of easy profit with B16.]
;W[bd]C[Tristan: This move is very large.];B[ce]C[Tristan: You more or less have to play this otherwise White starts eating stones in the top left and making both territory and power at the same time. C15 gains nothing, while White's corner has become fairly large (about 12 points), and so you have taken a loss here.]
;W[be]C[Tristan: As Black I'd be inclined to ignore this move, but on the otherhand C13 would be decidedly annoying as a White follow-up, so perhaps you judged rightly to answer it (see variation).]

(;B[bf]C[TJ: This move leaves behind excruciatingly bad aji. I reckon that you should have played C13 instead. That would link your stones up and create a certain amount of thickness; you could then ignore it if White carried on crawling into your "territory" (see variation).]
;W[cp];B[jd]C[I wanted to build my foundations early, to have a stable platform from which to engage later.

Tristan: That bad aji around C13 will come back and get you sooner or later. Fix it up while you still have the chance! You can never have a stable platform for fighting with such glaring weaknesses lying around.]
;W[dd]C[Tristan: Slow.];B[cm];W[nc];B[lc];W[de]C[Tristan: This is a very bad move.]
;B[cf]C[Tristan: White did you a big favour. She forced you to correct the bad aji. Now the left side looks quite decent for you.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[Tristan: It seems to me that this is the wrong direction. At any rate I cannot find a follow-up line in which you gain sufficient compensation for White's territory - M17 and K16 end up being too close to your wall.]
;W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[qe];B[pe];W[qh]
(;B[jq];W[pf]C[Tristan: This kind of hane is always very valuable. You might even lose the top right altogether now.]
;B[ne];W[eq];B[gq]
(;W[dn]LB[oq:A]C[Tristan: White does not need this as she is not under threat in the lower left. I think it would be a very long shot for Black to attempt to build a giant moyo by playing around here. A cool, calm move such as a shimari at P3 would look good to me here.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[oq]LB[mq:A]C[Too wide, I know. I should have jumped to A, perhaps. On the other hand, it seems like I should have been able to respond aggressively to white's counterinvasion. As you'll see, white took the whole corner.

Tristan: Difficult for me to say whether P3 is a mistake or not. It depends on how strong G3 and K3 are. Normally a two-space extension on line 3 is safe, but White has got a very strong position in the lower left and might be able to attack G3 and K3, which means that you will also have a hard time in the lower right should White attack there. It's too complicated for me to give advice, so perhaps you should show this position to a stronger player.]
;W[lq]
(;B[ko]C[Tristan: Maybe you should settle P3 quickly with R3, using the same techniques (crosscut and atari) as we looked at in the top left.]

(;B[hq]C[Tristan: I'd also look at ways of mixing it up with a cut at P6.]
;W[io];B[jo];W[gp];B[fq];W[fp];B[er];W[dr]LB[fr:A]C[I should have just connected at A.

Tristan: No, this is fine. It's later in the line you go astray.]

;W[om];B[kl];W[jm];B[jl];W[jn]C[Tristan: Black is surely lost now.]
;B[ml];W[lk]C[Tristan: I would prefer to "divide and conquer" with P8. I'm sure there's no way Black can live with two separated weak groups in the same part of the board.]
;B[ol]C[Tristan: Good move - answering the kikashi at M9 would have been suicidal. Trying to connect the weak groups is the best hope.]
;W[ll];B[nm];W[on]
(;B[mm]LB[mk:A]C[Tristan: This is a blunder - White was not threatening to capture. You simply cannot go wasting moves in such difficult fights. Point A was probably essential (see variation).]
;W[nq]LB[or:A]C[Tristan: There's a proverb saying that you should descend from the 3rd line to make aji. I would consider playing at A here.]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[nk];W[mn];B[nl]C[Heavy, but alive. 

Tristan: Heavy and not 100% alive - Q10 would steal an eye and I am not convinced you have space to live on the right side. Even if you live here, White is very thick in the centre.]

;W[pg];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni];B[oi];W[ph];B[mi]C[Tristan: Positional judgement:

Black
Left = 16-20 points
Bottom = 5-10 points
Top = 20 points

Max = 50 points

White 
Top left = 12 points
Centre = 15 points
Top right = 12 points
Bottom right = 24 points

Roughly = 63 points

Given that prisoners are even, Black is a long way behind here.]
