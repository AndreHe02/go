C[Hello, I played white, comments are put into the game marked as GVi. I lost the game, indeed it was a quick game, but I failed at opening (seems it is one of my weaknesses) and it lost the game as whole.

Thank you for your review
__________________________________________________

Saurus: Hi GVi. I am Saurus, and I'm 6 kyu IGS.

I will be reviewing the game your game for the white side.

I think you came out of the opening quite well. You shouldn't fear large moyos, as they can normally be reduced quite effectively.

I think the most important thing you need to learn is how to play inside your opponent's moyo. Read as much as possible about "light" moves. Three key concepts when playing inside your opponents moyo (General rules):

- If his stones are on the fourth line, invade deeply.
- If his stones are on the third line OR if he is strong in the area, reduce by playing fast and light moves such as 5th line reductions and two-space jumps.
- If you are forced to live inside his moyo, play as many contact moves as possible. See comments for how to put this into practice.

I have also put a summary of key areas that I think you should work on at the end of this game.

I enjoyed reviewing your game, and hope that you find my comments useful.

Regards
Mark (Saurus)];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc];W[df];B[kc];W[qn]
C[GVi: I was not sure if it was correct time and place, but I did not like the idea the B will gain two sides, he already had a small chinese opening in the top side. There is another variation I use, but I wanted try something different, seems it was too small

Saurus: This move was fine, but I think your follow-up was not ideal - see comments on the next move.]
;B[ql]
(;W[qq]C[Saurus: I think you need to set goals before choosing joseki.

Let's evaluate the board...

White has potential to make territory on the left and bottom.
Black has potential to make territory on the top and right.

Therefore your goals should be:
- Make territory on the bottom and left.
- Reduce or invade black's moyo on the top and right (don't expect to make any territory in this area.)

Your move at r3 is joseki, but it is bad here, because it will damage your potential to make territory along the bottom.

If there was a black stone at k3 or k4, your move would have been perfect, since there was then little potential for white territory along the bottom, but there isn't, so your move does more harm than good.

In this situation, a move like w-o4 would use the aji of r6 to make a nice chunk of territory and would go towards achieving your goals. 

(See variation)];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]
(;W[rp];B[ro]
(;W[sq]C[Saurus: This move ends up very badly for white. Black's unchallenged p3 stone means that black has influence along the bottom, which should belong to white.

See the variation for the correct continuation. It is worthwhile memorizing it, since it occurs in almost every game. 

(See variation)];B[qo];W[rr];B[pn]
(;W[od]C[Saurus: There are two vital issues here that I think I should mention...

1) There is a proverb which says: "Beware of going back to patch up."  Each time you leave a weakness, you leave more and more options open for your opponent to try something later, and his invasions are much more likely to succeed. P2 is an example of a weakness which could have been fixed in sente before moving on.

2) In fuseki, you should always play the biggest move. 
Which is bigger - invading my opponent's moyo, or building my own moyo? 

If white invades his opponent's moyo, black will chase white out to the center, while making territory. White will have to live or run, and the sequence will certainly end in gote for white, giving black a chance to invade at d5. Since the space at d5 is so wide open, black will settle easily, and might even make some territory in white's moyo. End result: Black makes territory top right and bottom left.  This result is unacceptable for white here. In this position, building your own moyo with c5 or d5 was MUCH bigger.

(See variation)];B[oe]
(;W[ne]C[Saurus: Good!];B[pe]
(;W[pd]C[Saurus: This is terrible shape. 

It's as if black has played a hane at the head of your two stones. With black to play now, he can simply cut at o16.

Connecting your stones was urgent. 

(See variation)];B[nf];W[me];B[mf]C[Saurus: You were very lucky that black did not cut.]
;W[mc]C[Saurus: Now you have to prevent the cut in gote. Connecting earlier would have been sente.]
;B[ke];W[qc];B[re];W[co];B[iq];W[dj]C[GVi: maybe P2 was more urgent

Saurus: No, after w-p2, b-d10, black's influence is too much.
W-d10 was urgent.];B[db]
(;W[ge]TR[qd][oe][pe][re][mf][nf][ql][pn]C[GVi: too far, at the nd I lost the stone.. now I realized the B has a strong wall with stones playing to the wall and I did not know what to do with it.

Saurus: Not a problem. Your territory top right and bottom left, along with your potential territory on the left are more than enough to compensate for the territory that black can make from his moyo.

You still have the ability to reduce black a lot, as long as you don't invade too deeply.]
;B[hd];W[he];B[id];W[gp]C[Saurus: White is now clearly in a better position.

Both white and black have large moyos (roughly equal in size.)
White's potential to make territory on the left is about the same as black's potential to make territory on the right.

However, white has a lot of secure territory bottom left and top right, whereas black has only a little territory on the top.]
;B[ho]
(;W[go]C[Saurus: This is tiny. You already had the corner. W-g5 only adds three points to your score, whereas black's h15 has added about 15 points to his.

G4 was safe, and did not need strengthening. If black EVER approaches a stable group, it is gote, and you have the chance to tenuki.

Why not take the initiative immediately with something like k10?

(See alternative)];B[hn];W[fm]C[Saurus: Two points in gote. If black had played there, and you had replied at w-d7, you would have been two points worse off.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[rc];W[qb];B[gr]
(;W[hr]C[GVi: this was a mistake, I wanted somthing like the variations. but later a realized that keeping black away just strngthned his center area. Now I fould pretty hard to go for center.

Saurus: Yes, h2 was a huge mistake. Reducing black's moyo was urgent.

(See variation)];B[hq];W[gq]C[Saurus: The next few move should all have been omitted.]
;B[fr];W[er];B[fq];W[ep];B[or]
(;W[pr]C[Saurus: I think a reduction would have been bigger. To give black sente here is catastrophic.

(See variation)];B[hk]
(;W[pj]C[Saurus: Too deep! Black can either cap and kill or make huge profit while chasing you out.

Always reduce a large moyo fast and lightly. Be prepared to sacrifice some stones in exchange for life elsewhere.

A standard reduction technique you should know is the 5th-line reduction. Here, you should have played at w-p10 (and not w-q10)

(See important variation)];B[ph]
(;W[pm]C[Saurus: No. This make your group heavy, meaning it becomes too valuable to sacrifice. You have to live, and you will suffer because of it.

This is probably the most important lesson for this review...

Always reduce with fast and light moves.

Fast, meaning bigger jumps such as two-space jumps and light, meaning you always have the option to give up some stones to make life elsewhere.

(See variation)];B[qm];W[pl];B[rj]
(;W[qk]C[Saurus: Black is MUCH stronger than you in this area. Fighting is futile. Leave you options open for later!

Play fast and light!

;B[np];W[mo];B[km];W[mi];B[nm]
(;W[om]C[No! Don't try to save everything. This is your opponent's moyo, not yours. There is no way you can have it all.

When invading a large moyo, you will always have to give up something to come out on top.

(See variation)];B[nk];W[nj];B[nl];W[ok];B[oi];W[oj];B[qj];W[ki]
;B[ih]C[Saurus: This result is not altogether unexpected, since you made your group heavy.]
(;W[ni]C[Saurus: Technique to learn:

If you are forced to live inside your opponent's sphere of influence play contact moves whenever possible, to increase your eye space. Black will have to defend each time, giving you sente to play another space-making contact move.

C[GVi: now I belive I should defnd my left side more, I payed for the mistake

Saurus: Yes, remember that if your stones are on the fourth line, an invasion will almost always succeed.

Invade your opponent if his stones are on the fourth line.
Reduce your enemy if his stones are on the third line or if he is strong in the area.

Black played correctly here.

C[Here are the things that I think you should focus on to improve your game...

Summary of key points:

1) Beware of following your opponent around. Remember that if your opponent approaches a stable group of yours, it is almost always gote, and you should be able to take the initiative. If your opponent plays a move near one of your strong groups, ask yourself: Is it stable? If yes, then tenuki. (Example - moves 42 and 44)

2) Change your thinking about how to invade large moyos: 
- Focus on not making a group heavy (ie. don't make it too valuable that it cannot be sacrificed). 
- All your moves in your opponents moyo should be fast and light.
-Read and understand the concept of light and heavy groups. 
- Don't try to save everything. Go into the reduction with the idea that you WILL give up a few stones.
- Reduction moves along the 5th line are often highly effective, since they may force your opponent to protect his territory along the third line, and you gain a lot on the outside.

3) If you are forced to live inside your opponent's sphere of influence, play as many contact moves as possible. This will force your opponent to defend on the outside, allowing you a series of sente moves to increase your eye-space.

4) Remember always that Go is largely a game of psychology.
He who has the strongest will wins. Tenuki as soon as possible AFTER ensuring that your group is stable (meaning that it can either live or run.)

I hope you found this review useful.    :)])
