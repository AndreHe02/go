C[D: Good Morning Paragoomba, I'm dERC/Jordan/the guy giving your game a review. I'll be marking my comments with a lower case d.]

(;B[gq]C[d: If it were me I would pressure at D5.];W[co];B[lq]
;W[id]
(;B[jj]C[d: This isn't a slow move, but it is definitely a passive one. I would go with a split at C10, or even an approach at C7, depending on whether or not you're good at fighting.

see variations for more details];W[nc];B[pc];W[ld];B[ej]C[d: This move is high, white can and does defend underneath.]

(;B[gj]C[I see this a lot and its no place of mine to say this is a bad move, but have you ever considered the advantages of just connecting over not connecting? its really a comparison of flexibility over durability, and depends on the situation at hand.]

(;B[ph]C[This move feels as though you had been sucked into whites rythym. if you catch yourself responding without thinking you can give up some important moves. R14 or 15  will solidify the corner enough for you to leave it on its own.]

;B[ij];W[kj];B[lj];W[hq];B[hp];W[im]C[d: I absolutely hate it when people play this way, rather than playing through skill they hope that their opponent will slip up. Nevertheless its one of the 36 dark school of taoism strategies, which basically means when you're about to lose just go for broke.

with each move white makes in your territory, you are forced to respond, squaring out his throwaway stone. Finding a move you don't need to respond to in these situations will give you an extra half a point.]

[si][sj][sk]C[dERC: Overall it was a good game. my advice to you is be more agressive and check to make sure you're not just following your opponents lead. Think outside the box, and look for situations where you can gain points by making things more complicated. This was a very straight forward game, I would like to see more fighting from you in the future. Work those fighting buns!!

I hope this review has helped you, and if it hasn't than hopefully it will get you thinking about different things. Goodluck Paragoomba!]
