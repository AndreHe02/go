C[yan2002 [5k\]: hi ^^
cardhu [5k\]: hi gg
yan2002 [5k\]: goodgame and have fun


Hi ,
I'm yan2002. This is a game I played not long ago and I lost by nearly 10 points. I would like to improve in go and teach others, but first I need to improve myself.

Thx for the revieuw already. ^^

PS you can leave the endgame if you want

F: This was an interesting game. You're biggest problem in this game is having a good understanding on how to attack your opponents groups. You had more than one possibility to attack black on the left side, or on the lower left side, but you could'nt take advantage of it. So I think you should work on that. If you want some studying material, I can recommend 'Attack and defense' in the Elementary Go Series.]

F: a suggestion in the variation];B[bm]
(;W[ci]C[F: This is completely wrong. You are strong on  the upper side. You should chase black to this side. Now you're letting him escape to the lower side.]

but then I think I wasnt aggressive enough];B[fh];W[ej]C[F: Very bad, this only strenghtens black]
;B[ei];W[ed];B[ec];W[id];B[hi]C[F: Now you have to take care of your two groups]
;W[fi]C[pure mistake here :(];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[op]C[Should I have kept attacking instead of doing a corner inclosure?

F: Black is already quite strong, so keeping on is probably not good.  You might even get in problems with one of your groups. So this move is good. Another idea would be to attack the black stones in the lower left]
;B[gf];W[gm]C[F: Rather vague, what is this move doing?];B[kc]

F: This is OK, but attacking immediately is also a possibility.]
