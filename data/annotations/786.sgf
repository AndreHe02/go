C[This is very unusual.  W usually invades at the 3-3 point and, less frequently jump out to 'a']
;B[dm]LB[dk:a][ck:b]C[This move is asking for a fight.  THere is no need to play like this.  Both 'a' and 'b' are simpler.]
;W[cm];B[ck]
(;W[do]LB[em:a]C[W gets a solider position with the variation at 'a', although B also ends up with a thicker position.]

;B[fp];W[jd];B[dk]C[B seems to have got the better of this exchange.]
;W[fo];B[gp];W[qn]C[.];B[pk];W[nq];B[qq]LB[pn:a]C[This move seems very incinsistent with B's overall thickness in the lower half of the board.  It is defensive and B should be on the attack. 'a' is the only move worth considering.]
;W[lq]LB[oo:a]C[Must be at 'a'.  This small extension is too cramped.]
;B[kq]LB[kr:a]C[This move doesn't make strength.  It is a defensive move which strengthens W. 'a' is much better.]
;W[no];B[oo]LB[pn:a]C[Better at 'a'];W[on];B[pn];W[pm]C[Look at the order of moves here.  If B had played correctly at 37 instead of 35 would he then play at 35 in response to 38?  Clearly not: he would play 36.  But in this sequene this is exactly what did happen.]
;B[po];W[nn];B[om];W[ol];B[pl]LB[qm:a]C[This is askingfor trouble.  The W stones are pretty much inattackable now so simply sonnecting underneath with 'a' is more solid.  It does preserve the small possibility of an attack on the W stones if the game were to develop favorably.]
;W[nm];B[qm];W[ql];B[rm];W[qk];B[pj]LB[rn:a]C[This position is scary.. W can leave it as it is until the balance of ko threats is in his favor and then play at 'a'. On the other hand B can play at 'b' to resolve it immediately.  Letting the opponent play hese option is not attractive to either player and so the ko must be started immediately.  Bit W cannot win it right now and so W46 was premature.  He should have waiting until the ko threat balance was more in his favor.]
;W[rn];B[om];W[eq];B[pm];W[er];B[fr];W[ds];B[fq];W[cs]C[W lost far more on the right tat he gained on the left.  Moreover he is left with a weak group clining to B's wall]
;B[qf]LB[mp:a][nc:b]C[This is the wrong direction.  It violates the principle of playing away from thickness.  B's position below is extremely strong and so B should be trying to force W to play close to it.  B should use the thickness as a springboard for invading the top and attackignthe W group below.  Making territory with thickness goes against basic principles.    B has a good attack starting at 'a', but it would be premature at this stage. I would invade at 'b' and use the B thickness to attack the W group on a large scale.]
;W[qh]LB[nd:a][pf:b]C[This move makes even less sense the B59.  What can W possible achieve by invading an overconetrated B position.  W should bwe delight that B has played overconcentrated and just extend to 'a' or attach at 'b']
;B[of];W[oh]C[W just gives B two targets to attack and the fate ot the lower W group is now put into doubt.]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[mc];W[oc];B[md]LB[mf:a][mb:b]C['a' is better shape for an attack on the W stones below.  If W protects the group below B can play 'b' in sente and then play a splitting attack below.]
;W[rd];B[rf];W[mh];B[mk]LB[mf:a]C[B needs to cover the weakness at 'a'.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[kp];B[jq];W[ko]LB[mf:a]C[In the space of a few moves B's whole game has fallen apart.  The bottom is now over concentrated while W has, a least termporarily stabilized all his stones.  In addition there is the weakness at 'a' to worry about.  The cause of this was B67 with lost a tempo.]
;B[jo]C[There is little prospect of attacking this group further for the time being. Separating the W group including W70  looks like it has better possiblities.  Even if the W group does not die (and it shouldn't) an attack is likely to spill over in to the top and naturally destroy W's territory there.]
;W[kn];B[nh]LB[mf:a]C[Too direct.  B is not strong enough above. B need more preparation.  I think I would reinforce at 'a' and bide my time.]

C[B has gained very little out of this sequence.  Sure, he got into the top, but he was probably going to do that anyway while attack.  Now he has los the attack on the W group.]
;W[kg];B[ec];W[dc];B[cf];W[ed];B[fc];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[be]
LB[ce:a][eg:b]C['a' is sente so B can get to play 'b'.  Letting W get to paly at 'b' is too big.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[ce];B[bd];W[cg];B[bf];W[eh];B[di]LB[bc:a]C[By palying the atari at W114 W has lost the sente block at 'a'.  It does not seem then theW gain enough extra in the center to compensate for that.]
;W[bc];B[mb];W[nk];B[nj];W[pr];B[qr];W[lr]C[Far too small.  there is still a lot of terrritory to claim in the center]
;B[qj]C[Why play this?  W cannot save the stones];W[jn];B[in]
;W[im];B[hn];W[ri];B[rj]C[This is gote.  W would have to take gote again to gain about 8 pts.  This is far too small at this stage.]
