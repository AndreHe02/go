C[Hello,
 I am dragon68 black in this game.

I would like you to comment freely, maybe focussing on pointing out the worst mistakes.

There a few places where I ask a specific question.

Thanks in advance.

Max- Hello I did my best. Sorry for my tardiness in replying. 

Overall I think your game suffered primarily from following black's lead and being a bit timid in some places. You missed some golden opportunities to press harder or cut. 

I hope you find my commentary useful.];B[pd];W[cd];B[pq];W[dq]
;B[qk];W[qf]
(;B[ph]LB[nc:C][nd:B][qe:A][qh:D]C[Max- This seems rather an odd move to me. A is the first move that occurs to me (see continuation), but I think calm moves B and C are playable.  If you must attack on this side, I think it's best to do so with D on the third line.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[oh]
(;B[pi]LB[nf:E][pf:B][ng:D][og:C][pg:A]TR[ph]C[Is Q11 needed or should I go to white corners ?

Max- If white played here after you go to the corners she's still a bit cramped and the triangle marked stone would still have some aji. But I think you can be more aggressive and play the sequence; black A, white B, black C, white D, and then black cuts w. E. The sequence gets  complicated and you have to be careful, but I think it works well for black. Iv'e gone over some of the sequences. At the very least I would suggest playing A first before going to the corners.]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[pg];B[ed];W[df];B[gc];W[dc];B[ec]C[Max- This seems slow to me. Many bigger moves to play. On the plus side, the fact that the d14 stone is high leaves you some aji.]
;W[ic];B[kd]LB[kc:B][lc:A]C[Max- I'd play A or B. Being on the fourth line leaves white the option of undercutting your territory after she pulls her stones out.]
;W[ie];B[ge];W[dn];B[fp]C[Max- This stone seems too close.]
;W[ep]C[Max- Mistake on white's part that strengthen's black.]
;B[fq];W[fo];B[jp];W[nq]
(;B[po]C[Is it better to pincer with M3 or M4, to let white invade right side, which I think is the idea of the chinese fuseki ?

Max- I would play M3. I don't see white making an invasion on the right. Might be done, but doesn't seem advantageous even if successful.]
;W[kq];B[jq];W[kp];B[ko];W[lo]LB[ln:A]C[Max- Black should double hane with A.]

(;B[kn];W[ln];B[no]C[Obviously I am trying to attack white as it is still weak.
Maybe It is better to invade left side d10 ?

Max- This attack doesn't gain you much and it strengthens white while leaving you with weaknesses. Yes, d10 or d12 would be better.]
;W[mp];B[nm];W[km];B[in];W[jm]
(;B[jn]LB[ch:A][cj:B][lm:C]C[Max- k6 was unnecessary and slow. Invade or cut would be my call.]
;W[mm];B[nl]C[Max- Again slow.];W[jr];B[ir];W[kr];B[hq];W[rh]
;B[ri]C[Max- you needn't answer every move of white's.];W[qh]
;B[qi];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe];B[jb]C[Maybe d10 is more urgent there ?

Max-Or d12.];W[ib]
(;B[jd]C[k17 was more obvious, i suppose this peep is not good ?

Max- Or you could invade. So white captures a stone. Big deal.]
;W[jc]C[Max-Follow through on your threat. Cut!]
(;B[kb];W[kc];B[lc];W[id];B[kg]C[Max-:You left some cutting points. See what happens if white cuts.]

(;W[le];B[ld];W[kf];B[lg];W[mf]LB[jf:A][lf:B]C[Max- Another cutting opportunity. I think A is best but B is not bad either.]

(;B[mi];W[dk];B[ch];W[cg];B[bg];W[bf]LB[dg:A]C[Max- Now atari at A.]

(;B[bi];W[dh];B[di];W[eh];B[ei];W[bk];B[cj]LB[fi:A]C[Max- I don't think white needed to answer. You should keep running with A.]
;W[ck];B[fi]C[I am not sure i made the best out of this invasion ?

Max- No. But you got a serious reduction in. You have weakened your e17 stones, but not sure how you could have avoided that at this late stage.]
;W[ag]C[Max. You have no eye space to speak of. Just run.]

Though I still don't see bigger moves...

Max- Well there's the cut at A, that's huge. Then if you miss that there's B, C or D. I think even E is bigger.]

(;B[jh];W[if];B[hh]C[this one seems really unnecessary

Max- It is. You should cut off white's stone with A, making that a wasted move.]

I think it could change the issue.
