C[[Dave\]
In this game, I played black.  My opening, which has been
improving rapidly these past 3 weeks, seemd to have fallen to pieces
this game -- the result was that I lost the game very early and
resigned.  I would really appreciate some comments on my opening --
especially alternative moves.  (Perhaps it has come time to study
joseki?)]
(;B[oc];W[qp];B[qd];W[cq];B[ce];W[dc];B[ed]C[[Dave\] Was this wrong?  Perhaps C17 better?]
;W[ec];B[dd];W[cc];B[do]C[[Dave\] Too early for
D5?  Is F16 critical?  Or perhaps just calmly play C10/D10?]
;W[eq];B[cj];W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ff]C[one should explore b hane at g14 or
atari at g16 (followed by extend to h16.  Not sure whether they're
right but worth considering.];W[gf];B[gg]C[i would explore cut at g16 then after w connects at
f17, extend to h16.];W[hd]C[[Dave\] I was
happy at this point; white had secured territory across the top, and I
had more potential for growth.];B[lc]C[[Dave\] Wrong direction?  I
thought about R6, but decided
against it because there didn't seem to be a point in developing a moyo
facing white's wall.


Maybe protect at f12 is more important ?];W[be];B[bf];W[bd]
;B[fo]C[b stones at top left are going to wither if w cuts at c14]
;W[di]C[[Dave\] This got way out of hand --
white picked apart my weaknesses, however, I got a good outside
thickness which eventually let me play R6 -- it looked
big.];B[fi];W[dj];B[ck];W[dk];B[cl];W[fk];B[hj]C[b got nothing for his
potential thickness at upper left, while w got BOTH territory in upper
left and a foothold in b's influence so b is falling behing]

Perhaps R6 was too greedy, and I should have stepped
back to R10?


almost ALWAYS, one respnds to r4 stone at p4 or p3.  playing r6
induces w to do exactly what he wants anyway, namely p4 or p3.]
;W[qi]C[[Dave\] I think this shows me that I was in fact trying for
too
much.];B[qk];W[qf]C[[Dave\] Now my potential is gone, and the game is pretty
much over.  Thanks in advance for any and all
tips!];B[of];W[og];B[pf];W[pg];B[rg];W[qg];B[ri]C[


better to play b s12 than s11, since b can connect either way
