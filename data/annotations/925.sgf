Hello,

It is my pleasure to review this go game. Let's enjoy go and improve on it together!

Because I am not good at English, there may be some words which seems confused in my reviewing, please be patient.

Yao Kai
Shenzhen, China];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[qk]C[5:
Sorry, I could not agree with black's using the Chinese opening at this point, even if I am Chinese myself, because white's 4.

After black's 5, white can play e3 to
1. protect its coner,
2. limit black's extention around r4.

You know, the territory around the komoku(q3 in this game) is of the most importance in the Chinese opening, so after black's 5, it should extend around k4. But unfortunately white's left-lower coner(c4 and e3 assumed) is so strong that
1. black's extention can not put impression on it,
2. black feels itself relatively weak at the same time.
(See variation 2, please.)

Important: not make the left-lower coner(c4 and e3) for d3 and c5! If so, extention around k4 would be very good for  both side, and to black's pleasure, it can obtain it ahead of white, because white need two moves to protect its left-lower coner.]

(;W[jp]C[6:
Not good shape.

The normal extention from c4(without e3) is J3, and at this point e3 is good enough for white.]
;B[ce];W[cd]C[8:
Bad.

It make black strong(d15) and leave weak potential in white's left-upper coner.]
;B[de];W[oc]C[10:
Very very bad!

Why? I can not understand it! Because
1. white should respond black's move in the left-upper coner,
2. even if white does want to approach black's right-upper coner, p17 can hardly be one of the candidates. At this case, o17 is the only choice.]
;B[mc]C[11:
Bad.

q17 is good enough, as it makes black's coner very strong while white's 10 weak. That's why white's 10 is very bad.]
;W[pc];B[od]C[13:
Too slack.

To make best use of its 11, black should not give white the coner to allow it to gain the base and make safe. Remember, r17(c17, c3 and r3 the same) is always the most important point for the coner, so black should take r17 at this time. Don't worry, white's r16 is not so severe as it looks.]
;W[qd];B[qe]C[16:
Not good.

After black's 17, white can not prevent itself from being enclosed in the coner. This move should be at s15. Thus white has two cutting points ---- r17 and s16. If white
1. cuts at r17, see variation 2,
2. cuts at s16, see variation 3.]
(;W[rd];B[re];W[se]C[18:
Slip to give black a gold chance.

White's coner is weak because the cutting point of r17. After this move, if black cuts at r17, white will have no move to answer it, see variation 2 please.]

(;B[sf];W[sd];B[rg];W[nc]C[22:
Bad.

This move makes black outerside strong, so white should play 24 without 22 to leave the choice at 016.]
;B[nd];W[qb];B[me]C[25:
Not necessary.

White should pay for its kenuki in the left-upper coner. Don't you think black's e17 is a good choice to attack white's 2 and 8? After that move, black can force white to live in the coner, and obtain thickness outside, which matches the strength of black's right-upper very well. And white's cut at n16 will be proved meaningless.]
;W[gc]C[26:
Not good shape.

The honte is f17.];B[ci];W[dl]C[28:
Not good.

Obviously, e3 to protect the coner is much bigger. Even if white does want to put impression on black's left group, tsume at c9 is much severer. At this point, if I took white, I would play n4 to exchange black's q5, and then e3.]
;B[mp];W[jd]C[30:
Wrong direction.

After black's 29, white's left-lower group is getting more weak, so e3 to protect the coner is necessary. On the other hand, black's right-upper group is very strong, so moving near to it is dangerous and of less value, for white can hardly gain points in the upper boarder.]
;B[hq]C[31:
Now white gets into trouble for its letting the left-lower group uncared.]
;W[fq];B[jq]C[33:
Bad! Too coward!

Black's h5 is honte at this point: is splits white's 6 out, which becomes the target to attack.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[io];B[iq];W[gp];B[kp];W[jo]C[40:
Now although black gains some territories along the lower boarder, white becomes thick at the same time. This result is not good for black, because it should have put stones in the left-lower to split white into several groups and attack them to make much more profits.

It is time for both to calculate their territory to decide which way they should follow with next moves.

For black,
the left-upper: 6 points,
the lower boarder: 15 points,
the right-upper: 12 points(by estimating),
totally 33 points.

For white,
the left-upper: 15 points,
the left-lower: over 15 points,
the right-upper: 12 points,
the komi: 5.5 points,
totally 47.5 points.

So white leads 14.5 points. Therefore black must try to ensure some more territories or make a large moyo, and remerber black has weak group(the left-upper). Above all, at this time, black should try to:
1. make its weak group stronger in sente,
2. make large moyo along the right side, waiting for white's invasion and take profits with attacking the invader(if white did not try to destroy the moyo, black would happily change it into territory with several more moves).
(See variation, please.)]
(;B[dk]C[42:
Slack.

It should be c9, which is the key point for both to gain territory along the left boarder.
(See variation, please.)

Because black is strong in the right-upper while white is thick in the left-lower, both have little possibility to make large moyo in the center.]

(;W[ek];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[cn];B[el]C[47:
Slip.

It should be c9. Why not d10? It is always the normal move. Because if so, white's b7 will be sente.]
;W[ck];B[dj];W[bl]C[50:
White ate two stones of black and obtain the left boarder. Too big!]
;B[ej]C[51:
Not good.

It forces white's 52 to make white stronger, missing the chance to invade into white's moyo.]
;W[fk];B[po]TR[pm]LB[mb:a][gr:b][jk:c][bd:d]C[53:
Now it is another time for both to calculate their territory.

For black,
the left: 10 points,
the right-upper: 9 points,
the lower and right-lower: 33 points,
totally 52 points.

For white,
the left-upper: 15 points,
the left-lower: 40 points,
the right-upper: 12 points,
the komi: 5.5 points,
totally 72.5 points.

So white leads 20.5 points. Even if black uses one more stone(marked as triangle) to contain nearly all of the right boarder, white can use its turns to occupy several biggest end-game moves(marked as letters). Thus white can continue to maintain its leading, so it is not necessary to invade black's moyo.]
;W[jj]C[54:
A little greedy.

It should be k9, because it is 52 and 40's cross point.];B[mh]
;W[ld]C[56:
Very bad.

It is meaningless and wastes the chance at n18 in sente(a very big end-game move).]
;B[md];W[lm];B[ln]C[59:
It should be L6. No battle no win for black now.];W[kn];B[mn]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[nl];B[om]C[65:
Slack.

It is better for p8.];W[mj];B[ni];W[ol];B[pl];W[oj];B[ok];W[nk]
;B[ph]C[73:
Bad, too slack.

Now white can leave it alone and do some big end-game moves elsewhere. Black should play q10 to try to contain as large as possible using the ko.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[qm]C[77:
It should be r10.];W[pi];B[oi];W[qj];B[kb]C[81:
>>From now on, it goes into the end-game period. To my point of view, both black and white are not good at it. They should learn the basic end-game theory and tesuji.   As a whole, black's losing moves are 11, 33 and 47.

Now Black loses too much and could catch up only if he were good at end-game moves as Lee Changhao, the No.1 go professional. So I will not review each move after 81.

Reviewing ends here.];W[jb];B[kc];W[jc];B[ed];W[ec];B[gd];W[fd]

[bd:e]C[50 and 52:
White disables the possibility for black to make large moyo to seek the balance at the level of the whole game.

Attention: the right-lower can not be said the territory of black now, because white can invade at r5 and r3(marked as triangle).

If black spends an additional move to ensure its safe, white can take the end-game moves first at a, b, c, d and e as the sequence of alphabet. Thus white will lead 5 points or so.]

White loses it left-upper coner(about 6.5 points) and has no base to ensure that it is alive when attacked in future; while black gains some territories and becomes alive and strong. If white continues to leave itself uncared, black's attack at k18(marked as triangle) will be proved fatal to white.]
