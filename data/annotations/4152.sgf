C[[kk1\] In all a good game by B. Main comments to improve game play:
1. try not to play too defensively all the time. assume that not all stones played will live even if they were not initially intended to be sacificed. Instead you could take advantage of an even greater weakness of the opponent
2. When placing a stone, try to think of all the possible uses for a stone at that point. You have one motivation for playing in that area, investigate the nearby points to see if they also satisfy the original motivation as well as offer flexibility when the direction of play varies. This also prepares you when the original goal can no longer be attained, the played stone can still be part of your alternate plans.
3. look to initate play in other areas, especially open areas where territory is unsettled. Each time a this can be done will often be worth much more than the small boundary skirmish or saving of a few stones.
4. It is good to play many games at the start and playing fast games will be good for this. It also shows you deeper consequences as more moves are played in a given time frame. Try to mix in playing of some slower, longer games, if you don't already do so. This will prevent you from developing too many reactive habits and let you think more about strategy and deeper tactics.

I'm a beginner player, I've been reading go books for about fifteen years now but only now have started actually finding opponents.  I think I'm reading books at a 15k level, but my play has yet to catch up.

This was a great game for both of us. I had a forty-point lead at the end, but I felt keenly pressured throughout.  I'm interested in feedback on the points of my play that need particular scrutiny.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp];W[jd];B[dj];W[pj]C[I tend to play tic-tac-toe at the beginning of the game.  Usually my opponent makes the first approach move.
[kk1\] There's nothing wrong with this. Just try not to make it so automatic that you miss opportunities if and when they arise. Once you have exhausted this style of opening play, you can try different ones for contrast and comparison.]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cf];W[nc];B[pf]C[[kk1\] Fine opening play by both sides]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[qh];B[qf]C[Both of these iron pillars seemed passive and the one at the top makes particularly bad shape, but I don't know what else to do.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc]C[[kk1\] you play a good defense leaving very little weakness that you have to use later moves to reinforce.]
;B[nf];W[cd]C[[kk1\] in this exchange, the top-right corner seems greater, so B should have played there first. B's top right group is settled and O14 did not put much pressure on any of W's groups. If W played C16 or C17 first, it would do so in sente.]
;B[cl];W[cr];B[fc];W[fd];B[ic]C[A tight side invasion like this is particular unexplored territory for me, as will be clear in a few moves.]
;W[ec];B[kb]C[I had a bold notion that surrendering F17 would give me time to build a base]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[gb];B[ga]C[This move makes me think that I forgot the plan.  Is H18 a similar threat that would be more helpful to my remaining stones?]
;W[eb];B[hb];W[fa];B[ha];W[lb];B[kc];W[lc];B[id]C[I see dead stones.  They don't even know they're dead.

[kk1\] consider L16 instead. It can either capture the W stone to the left, or meet up with friendly B stones to the right.]
;W[kd];B[he]C[I know I need to run, and I feared that H14 would be cut.]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[ff];B[hg]C[[kk1\] consider cutting at M16. It may create a bigger problem for W than B is running from.]
;W[be];B[bf]C[I knew he'd plant a flag in the middle of my base (A12 if not worse) if I ignored this

[kk1\] good play];W[dg];B[ch];W[cg];B[bg];W[fh]
(;B[kg]C[This seems like a mistake now.  K13 would have been just as much in the open and much less likely to be cut.

[kk1\] true. The cutting point at M16 is still a major weakness for W. see the variation which leads to interesting situations that seem better for W than B.]
;W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih];B[dh]C[[kk1\] this didn't seem to be so big or urgent. perhaps you just didn't think of a better move, given the pace of the game]
;W[eh];B[di]C[[kk1\] this is overly defensive and reactionary. it could be ignored and initate play elsewhere for a much greater advantage. ideas: cutting at M16 or J15; H11 or J11. also N3 is a large still unplayed point, similarly for Q7]
;W[fj];B[ij]C[H10 seems better now that I'm lookiing back, but it's getting awfully close to enemies on both sides.
[kk1\] perhaps better to peep at G11, W may connect, then J11 trumpet]
;W[ki];B[hi]C[[kk1\] yes a cut by W was possible. you should realize that W is in as much trouble with cuts at M16 and J15. Remember that it's relative--your groups may be weak, his groups may be weaker.]
;W[kf];B[je]C[I figure I'll sacrifice this stone so I can make the cut at M16 in sente]
;W[ie];B[ld]C[The weak part of the plan is that H16 is a huge vulnerability for me. Fortunately, I saw it before he did.]
;W[ke];B[md];W[mc]C[[kk1\] that was a good play by B. protect the cut at H16.]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[qa];W[oa]C[I'd better ask about those last four moves, because I play on the second line like that all the time.  Is it sound?  It seems like most people descend to Q19, but then you lose sente.]
;B[el];W[hk];B[hd]C[I wanted to escape more, but I noticed the cutting point and realized that it was incredibly urgent.]
;W[hc];B[ia]C[[kk1\] unnecessary moves by both W and B];W[ka]

(;B[ib]LB[ib:A][ss:B]C[I'm not convinced this response was needed, I sure hate risking seven stones and giving his white group uncontested life just because I failed to see some clever tesuji.
[kk1\] good to see you were aware of the danger. as you later realized, this was not needed yet and gave sente to W]
;W[kh];B[ik];W[hl];B[il];W[in];B[gk]C[I hoped that cutting here would leave his three white stones as desperate to find life as I had been.]
;W[gj];B[hj];W[gl]C[[kk1\] W should have played a simple net at F8]
;B[fk];W[fl];B[ek];W[km];B[ej]C[Wow, I bet F11 would have worked much better than forcing him to make that move himself.]
;W[fi];B[eg];W[df];B[ef];W[de];B[ee]C[[kk1\] L9 is so important]
;W[fe];B[bn]C[My next plan is destroying his corner while simultaneously keeping him from connecting with his stones on the right.]
;W[kk]C[This hit me hard.  I nearly resigned in frustration.  About five turns later, it struck me that I would probably win the capturing fight with the separated one-eye group at the top when it came to that.
[kk1\] glad you stuck it out. you always should, you may learn more from a gone bad than an uneventful one. Excellent analysis about the top W group. If the cut was made at M16 earlier, it may have saved you many escaping moves.]
;B[jm];W[im];B[jn];W[jl];B[en]C[Back to the destroy and separate plan.]
;W[jo];B[kp]C[[kk1\] why didn't you save your group. the ladder fails.]
;W[kn];B[aq];W[eo];B[fo];W[dq];B[em];W[er];B[fr];W[br]C[We didn't get back to this group for a long time.  I kind of speculated that it was still unsettled and that I should play A2 to put the final nail in the coffin, but didn't get around to it.  What's its status?]
;B[hp];W[mp];B[mq];W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[po];B[ro];W[rn]
;B[sp];W[sn];B[mi];W[kj];B[oi]C[This is a half-hearted invasion move, but I started to second-guess the stability of the N11-O14 connection given the huge white wall.]
;W[nj];B[nh]C[I thought about playing a point lower, but the threat of O13 was haunting me.]
;W[mj];B[oj];W[ok];B[pi];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rg]C[I saw that the cut was too ambitious and figured that making this exchange would solidify my corner.]
;W[rh];B[lg];W[jg];B[lh];W[li];B[ni];W[od];B[oe];W[pa];B[qb]
C[The flaw in my edge design is that I have to connect in gote, but my theory is that sente is worth less as the game goes on.  Thoughts?]

;W[qq];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[dm];B[ds]C[This didn't work for me at all.]
;W[es];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds]C[Take that!];W[ar];B[nd]C[I suppose this is better than letting white play here, but I did overlook the fact that my monkey jump at the bottom is now unsecure.]
;W[ap];B[bo];W[bp];B[cm];W[cn];B[bm];W[co];B[mo];W[nn]C[This was a much stronger response than I expected.]
;B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[ll];B[mn];W[no];B[lo];W[nl];B[gn]C[I was trying to destoy his eye space..  Seconds later, it dawned on me that the cut probably would have caught the four white stones.]
;W[hm];B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[fm];B[lf];W[le];B[me];W[af];B[jf]
C[I didn't even look to see how bad his follow up would be.  I figured it couldn't possibly be more urgent than this.
[kk1\] you're probably right at this level, but that is a very bad habit to develop and hard to break.]
;W[ce]C[Yeah, even if he had been able to cut those three stones I'd just move my wall down to AB-11 and in exchange I got six prisoners and the comfort of knowing that I could kill the top white group without having the game be on the line.]
;B[ag];W[ae];B[bi];W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[ph]C[Is this better than R13?]
;W[qg];B[rf];W[pg];B[og];W[rj];B[fs];W[ep];B[fp];W[dl];B[dk]
;W[ao];B[an];W[gg];B[ii];W[jh];B[ja]C[If I knew then what I know now, I'd have played N19 first.  We didn't have any languages in common and he was rated at 27k, so I wasn't certain that I could convince him that his group was dead.  So it turned into an absurd ko fight that he didn't want to win but wouldn't give to me.  Kind of stretched out the endgame.]
