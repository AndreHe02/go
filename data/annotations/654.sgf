I think this was my second biggest loss ever - and I really don't know
what went
 wrong.

I'm "strombrg", I played
white.];B[pp];W[cd];B[dp];W[pc];B[pe]C[White's move (R16)
is too passive. R15 would have been appropriate if the goal was to
challenge on the right side.]
(;W[qd];B[qe]C[Another more in the UR corner
would have been appropriate.]
(;W[ec]C[Is this truly "too slow"? I thought
making a shimari was good.

The move is just fine, locally, but white owes black a move in the UR
corner.];B[oc]C[The next move is terrible.]
(;W[pd]C[
Emtpy triangle == bad?  I know something went wrong in this corner, but
I'm not
sure what.

Yes, an empty triangle has fewer liberties than other groups.]
;B[od]C[White's group is easily killed from here.];W[cj]C[Finally, I try
to grab some territory.  Or was there still an urgent move back in the UR
corner?

Sometimes it is best not to spend more moves on a hopeless situation, so
I'm inclined not to criticize 12 C10, which is pretty big.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[pb];W[qc];B[pj]C[There's almost a double wing here.
  I know I need to play around A.  But I'm worried that black is going to
play at B and grab the corner.

Black decided that 17 Q10 was bigger than killing the corner; perhaps
your other moves (I can't see your A and B) are likewise bigger than
saving it.];W[re];B[rf];W[sd];B[of]C[I'm still concerned about a
black play at A.  Or is B more urgent? Or C or D?

I think that white is alive now.  I would play either C06 or P03 (to
prevent black from getting too large a moyo).

R18 is a very small move.]
(;W[qb];B[jp]C[There it is.  Another double
wing.  This seems to appear in a lot
of my games.

You let him do it by playing more moves than were necessary to secure your
UR corner.];W[jc]C[24 K17 was good.];B[ej]C[You should be a little
worried about black's moyo developing on the lower side. You want to
invade or reduce it before that becomes truly difficult.]
(;W[di]C[Is this
a good response?  Is there something
better?];B[fh];W[eg];B[je]
(;W[mc]C[This ended up not working well.  Maybe
A would've been better?  Or something else?

The thing is, I know I'm incredibly behind, so I'm no longer playing at
all cautiously.

Actually, this is OK. You are, however, extending towards strength.   Did you have concrete plans regarding the invasion of black's moyo? How
does this move work with them .];B[ic]
(;W[id]C[Davies book Attack and
Defense is a good place to review these sequences. You will see that the
one you choose here leads to results other than what you had intended.]
;B[jd]
(;W[hc];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[if]C[The sequenc you played
starting with J16 gave black the right side and you the left, which was
probably to his advantage. You had to give black something. It would have
been better to let him invade a little on the top in exchange for
establishing a living presence with a little influend in the upper right
quadrant of the board.];W[cm]C[40 C07 is too timid. Go further.]
;B[dn];W[qq]C[This is wrong here. You get the corner, but you cannot win
this game without a bigger invasion, which would normally come along a
side. The corner is too small, and makes the necessary side invasion even
harder to accomplish later.];B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[pr]
C[I don't
like 48 Q02.   S06 is standard.];B[or]

invade at S02.]
(;B[os];W[rr];B[nq];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl]C[R08 is a weak
point. It can be used by white later in an invasion. Black would have been
stronger still by just playing R08 earlier - there isn't much territory to
be had on the first line!]
(;W[eq];B[dq]
(;W[er];B[gq]C[White' s attempts at
invasion are not sufficiently flexible. You have to be willing to
sacrifice stones. The player whose territory is being invaded cannot stop
everything, but if you announce your intentions it is easy to stop them.]

of your position in the game.];B[jk]C[This is white's last chance.

summary, white made moves in the early part of the game that ignored
black's threat to construct a moyo. Joseki advice is available in the book
"In the Beginning."

Later, white's attempts at invasion suffered from tactical weakness and an
unwillingness to sacrifice stones.  Invasion sequences are found in
several books, including "Get Strong at Invading."

Finally, white's efforts to break into the moyo were insufficiently
aggressive. This is a matter of personal style, but also a matter of
realizing when aggressive moves are appropriate.];W[tt]TW[aa]
