C[Hi, I was White in this game. Above all, I think my fuseki was a bit chaotic so some comments would be nice.

Hello, my name is Pavel. My comments will be marked as 
P:];B[pp];W[qd];B[dd];W[dp];B[dg]C[S: This looks very unusual.]
(;W[qn]C[P: There are better options. See variations];B[lp]
;W[pj]C[S: The Black answer to my approach seems very wide. Should I have attacked immediately around o3?

P: Well that depends on the style you prefere. From my point of view, at the moment, there are better places to invest stones]
;B[pg]
(;W[oc];B[oe];W[fc]C[S: This looks bad as Black already has the D13 stone. I think an attack on the P15/Q13 stones would have been better, maybe R14 to steal their base?

P: I belive you are right. It's to early to attack upper left corner. First you must deal with invading stones]
;B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[fe];B[kd];W[dj]TR[dl][dm][dn]C[P: too wide. you just invite invasion at the marked points]
;B[dm]C[S: It's hard for me to cope with his quick invasions.]

P: Well. Thats it. let me give you some advices.

1. Make your moves safely.
2. Use sente to push your enemy around to gain profit.
3. Sometimes saving a distressed stone worth you a lot of territory. So you must consider sacrificing it deliberately, but it trying to get some profit (terrytory or influence).
4. Sometimes sacrificing a stone give much greater profit that one point. You see, under japanese rules, when you play inside territory of your opponent, and he makes his responding moves inside his own territory - the score doesn't change. Since for every captured stone, your enemy will cover one of his own territory points. So, don't hesitate to risk.]

(;W[od]TR[oc]MA[qj][pj]C[P: One of the fuseki principles says that first you must attack or enclose unbalanced corners. Upper right corne is the only unbalanced one. Another good move is triangled point.
