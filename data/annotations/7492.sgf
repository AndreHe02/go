C[cthufoo [9k\]: have fun
pooishness [10k\]: hi gg

In this game. I felt like I handled fuseki pretty well, but my achilles heel has always been invasions...

I'd like comments on how to improve handling invasions


Hi];B[pc]C[cthufoo [9k\]: how long were you waiting for a long game?]
;W[pp]C[pooishness [10k\]: oh not long.];B[dd]C[cthufoo [9k\]: lol]
;W[cp];B[qe];W[jc];B[lc]LB[hc:A]C[Here I thought better to extend and make the natural extension from my corner.  A I felt would have been loose.. is this the right side though?

Yes, although the other one can also be played I guess.];W[fc]
LB[ec:B][hc:A][fd:C]C[A I've seen in a lot of pro games.. but I didn't feel comfortable playing it.
B I was debating to just take the corner and extend at d 14
C I thought would be best. because of the influence joseki and my strong position at the top right.

I think A would be fine, but there are a lot of possibilities as usual in the opening]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[fe]LB[ec:A]C[I expected this.

yes, it would have been better than the game move]

;W[ed];B[ee];W[hb]LB[bb:B][jb:A]C[Ok. here my opponent played out of joseki but I'm still happy with the result.  He doesn't have corner and he's only got very little influence I tenuki'd here, but maybe you'll see something more critical. for me to attack like A or B.

You get the sente and influence for a tiny territory, it's a good result for you (d18 was bad). B is too small for the moment, and A is not a good attacking point for the moment (white could just draw back at J17 and break through towards the center). If you want to attak in this zone K16 is a big point I think (you want white to live tiny on the edge while you get a huge wall from C16 to M17. But your next move is fine.]

(;B[dk];W[fq];B[kq]LB[dk:A]C[I don't like this move. A was working well with your upper wall, and you will have to play with your influence. I think K16 was in order now, building big in the center. By diving so low into the right side, you allow white to get center influence if he wants, and he will be able to destroy some of your influence. Invading the right side was not pressing, and if you want to invade, you have to invace higher (on 4th row, L4 for instance), so that white cannot destroy your center influence. You want to play high to have your upper wall working well.]
;W[nq]C[this is bad, n3 would be better];B[hq];W[cm]LB[dq:A]
C[Is A still possible?

It's not pressing, the center is the issue here I think (K16 again)]
;B[cl]C[This does not feel right.];W[qj]LB[dm:A]C[Now A is big, your central influence would be big]
;B[qm]LB[oj:A][dm:B]C[Again, not the way to go I think. If you don't want to play B, then A might be good way to play on the right (or K16 before)]
;W[qo];B[om]C[Now you are fleeing towards the center, allowing white to destroy your central influence if he wants by jumping along with you]

(;W[qg];B[of];W[je]TR[om][qm]C[Oops, now white has broken through towards the center. Compare with when you playe K16 first - the difference is huge. Moreover you have two stones floating (triangle stones), so you don't have good prospects in the center anymore]
;B[hf];W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[nd];W[kc];B[pj]LB[oj:A]TR[qg][qj]
C[A instead is a better shape, you usually make enemy stones stronger by attaching them (and you want the two traingle stones weaker, not stronger.

White should have jumped to A first, so you would punish him by taking this good point (A).]
;W[pi];B[oj]LB[qk:A]C[A would be better for white, same problem as with D18]
;W[rl];B[ql]LB[qk:A]C[No, white's weakness was A, like E17 after D18 in the fuseki]
;W[qk];B[oi];W[ph];B[oh];W[dh]LB[ei:A]TR[dk][cl]C[Ok. this is the key question for me.  how to handle that white stone.  Normally, I'd attack it on the d11 or maybe e11.  but according to kato's attack and kill, i should make him heavy first, then move lightly.
 I wasn't too comfortable with d15 cut so I thought, defend that cut and make white heavy at the same time.  hence. d13


You don't want to attach a weak stone, again. d13 and d11 are bad moves (you are not making your opponent heavy by attaching in general, on the contrary he can hane and then sacrifice his original stone (treat it as light). Here you are very strong (because white hasn't played the crucial D7, so your two triangle stones are super strong, and could even be made almighty with a single move D7 for you.

So just A would enclose the stone (it is basically dead I think, white should have played the mandatory D7 before thinking about invasion), and actually maybe D7 for you would be even stonger (try to kill this invading stone on a large scale, D7 is a hige point anyway)]
;B[dg];W[dj]LB[ej:A]C[Just A now would enclose the wihte group I think., push hose stones towards your upper wall]
;B[eh];W[di];B[ek]LB[fk:B][dm:A]TR[dk][cl]C[If white had a stone at A, your nobi would be an ok shape. But here your traingle stones are very strong already, no need to advance so slowly (jump at B is fine)]
;W[ei]LB[fh:C][ek:A][fk:B]C[NowIf A was at B, C would finish the kill]
