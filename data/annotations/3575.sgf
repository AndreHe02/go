AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[- hi im lect, 5k on KGS. i will be reviewing this game.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[fp]C[- this feels too high];B[kq]C[- interesting. W really can't afford to lose any stones this early in the game, so W is going to have to make some sacrifice.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[iq];B[eq]C[- good, keep W cramped.];W[dk]C[- W has too many groups. something will have to die]
;B[ko];W[cf];B[df];W[dg]
(;B[ef];W[ce];B[cd];W[gc];B[fd]C[- not a good result, see variation]
;W[id];B[lc]C[-F17 first];W[md]C[-this is not a good move. why force B to strengthen his stones? this is aji-keshi. it removes the potential at R17 and O17]
;B[mc];W[nd];B[nc];W[pe];B[od];W[oe];B[ld]C[- not too big]
(;W[nf];B[pj]C[- im not sure what u were trying to do here, but  R10 seems better]
;W[qh];B[qd];W[qe];B[eg];W[dh];B[le]C[- this move is??? F17 is still quite urgent]
;W[eb]C[-good];B[fb]C[- this is quite silly];W[fc];B[ec];W[db]
;B[cb];W[qj]LB[dc:a]C[vernon: I thought it would have been more productive for W to have pushed at D17 (a) in order to rob B of his base in the corner. Thoughts?

-pushing at A is small change for W. R10 is active for W];B[pk]

(;W[pi];B[dc];W[gb];B[qk];W[rj];B[io]C[- good idea, but its better to destroy W's base first.]

(;B[de]LB[jn:A]C[- this is not needed and isnt sente. A is better]
;W[co];B[do];W[jn];B[kn];W[jl];B[ll]C[vernon: B chose to defend the Q4 moya and try to separate F4 from O14 instead of keeping F4 eyeless. Thoughts?

- at this point, F4 is ok. M8 is still good, as it increases B's territory]
;W[gl];B[el];W[ek];B[mf]C[- small. biggest move is R3 right now]

(;B[lj]C[vernon: B's thought was that this move guards the cut at Q5 and separates W's groups.

- there is  no cut at Q5. see variation];W[jj];B[if];W[eh]C[-good]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[fr];W[gr];B[hr]C[vernon: F2 was a waste. B decides that keeping W away from J3 is more important than saving F2, but that decision weakens the D4 group.

-yep, a waste indeed. silly, too.];W[er];B[dr];W[fs];B[bp];W[bo]
;B[br]C[vernon: B spends a move securing D4, gives W sente.]

i'd suggest to both players to take a time out to read ahead a little bit - some moves were not sente and could've been used to play bigger points.]
