C[Fegg: "The opening has always been my weakest point. This is my first effort to try the san ren sei."

An email from Bing - "I would be happy, if you also could comment on some of my moves. Most important for me are the moves, where my invasion into blacks san ren sei went wrong (maybe 52 E8 and 56 E6 are overplays?).

After that I was falling far behind in the game. At the end I was luckely able to recover.

There is also this question about the attach and extend with the san ren sei. I thought it did not fit well, as attach and extend goes for territory and san ren sei for influence. What is your opinion?"

forfun (DS) - Thanks for giving me the chance to review your game.  It was quite interesting.  I've tried to point out a few things as I saw them.  I also added quite a few variations without comments - hopefully the stones speak for themselves.  If there are any points that are unclear, feel free to send me a follow-up question or two.  Look at my variations with a critical eye - there are mistakes to be found there (my own games are full of them!).]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[dj];W[qo];B[jp];W[fc]C[Fegg: "My friend and opponent Bink (very sportingly) informed
me that my attach and extend did fit with the san ren sei well"

DS - Let's look at this at the end of the joseki.];B[fd];W[gd]
;B[fe];W[ec];B[dc];W[jc];B[qf]C[DS - I think that the attach and extend has worked fine for black in this position.  with the stone already in place on K4 in addition to the san ren sei, the attach and extend has more the feeling of speedy thickness than aiming for territory.  Black has not defended with a play at D14 ("a slack move" - Ishida volume 3).  The good point of the attach and extend here is that it is virtually forcing and allows black to set the pace of the game.  I think the 1-space low pincer at H17 would be the expected play in a pro game but would allow white to take sente.]
;W[pi]C[DS - A nice aggressive reply, more interesting than O16 for example.  How should black answer?]

(;B[qc]C[DS - I favor the 3-3 invasion in my own games but I wonder if it is the right move here.  It seems to fall in with white's plans.

Now white faces the classic choice - which side to block on?]

(;W[pc]C[DS - This seems like the wrong side.  White's position on the top is too limited.]
;B[qd];W[pe];B[qe];W[pf]
(;B[jg]C[DS - This is an interesting idea, black seems to be trying to find the right point to both limit white and build up black's moyo on the left.  To return briefly to the question of the attach and extend joseki - it seems that black is thinking in terms of influences radiating from the upper left rather than of territory there.    However, this play is too distant from white to force a reply at the top, so white has time to invade.]
;W[cf]C[DS - One of the normal invasion points.  However, white has quite a tough time of it.  In particular black's stone sitting out at K13 is a barrier that usually isn't there when white runs out.  Alternatively it is a source of strength for black if the corner stones have to run out themselves.]

(;B[ce]C[DS - Black follows joseki and protects the cutting point.  But is black weak here?]
;W[dg]
(;B[ed]
(;W[ge]C[DS - White makes black stronger before trying to save the invading stones.  This is not the best approach here.  Just B2 instead?]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[gg];B[ff];W[ig];B[hh];W[if];B[ih];W[bf]
C[DS - White is overly optimistic in assuming that black will answer this. Black plays along in the game but should not have.]

(;B[be];W[bj]C[DS - once white plays here black can not expect to capture everything. Black should now aim to seal white in if possible since the potential at the lower left is greater than the value of the stones white has played so far.]

(;B[ci];W[bi];B[ch];W[bh];B[cg]
(;W[cl]C[DS - This is the right idea.]
(;B[bg]C[DS - This is too slow, white should answer at C6.]

(;W[ag]C[DS - Both white and black are concentrating on stones with no value.  White should again be at C6.]
;B[ah];W[ai];B[df]
(;W[el]C[DS - C6 first would give white some base before jumping out.]
;B[fj];W[gp]C[DS - An overplay];B[cn]C[DS - What would white have done if black had played F5 for a splitting attack?]
;W[en];B[dm]C[DS - Black in turn over plays the position.  This peep is not possible with a knight's move because it can be cut,just as white does. Black's D4 stone needs to be on C4 or C5 in order for this peep and cut to be effective.]
;W[dl];B[em]
(;W[fm];B[fl]
(;W[gm]C[DS - There does not appear to be time for this play.  This is not a threat to black's F8 stone because black is strong at the top.]

(;B[hm]C[Fegg: "My (black) moyo in the center looks promising, but what
is the best way to use it? My efforts seemed to give white far
too much area."

DS - The key point here is to understand that black has no moyo really.  White can come in from the P5 stone, the Q11 stone, or use the aji of the H8 stone.  As a result, black's prospective area is not so large.  The center is not the main issue now but rather what white will make of the right side and whether or not the black stones at the bottom will ever be attacked.]
;W[mn]C[DS - White exploits the gap between the stone on O8 and the bottom stones.]

to use the cutting points at N10 and M8 to my advantage. After
consideration I decided that it was too dangerous to procede."

DS - It looks like there is nothing like that here. However, it is black's next stone that is probably the losing play.]

(;B[ki]C[DS - This is almost worthless.  White wisely takes the opportunity to grab the last big yose point at P2 after a couple of forcing moves.]

;B[io];W[go];B[sg];W[si];B[jn];W[kn];B[lh];W[ng]C[DS - The stage is set for black to reap the rewards from the cut at M8.  Before looking ahead, try to read out the ko fight at L5.]

;W[pa];B[qa];W[lp];B[oq];W[pr];B[ls];W[ia]C[DS - Now white's turn to make a mistake.  White should play H1, J1, G1.  Black has to add a stone.  Actually black should have played M1 at L2.]

;B[qb];W[lp]C[DS - Black looks like have a little over 100 points (90+ on the left and 10 or so in the UL.  White looks like 8-10 in the LL, 70 in the upper center and a lot in the LR.  If black now tries to reduce the LR, whites center will naturally grow as he attacks the black invaders.  In the same way, if black chooses to encroach on the center, whites right side will swell up.  I'd rather be white than black.]
)
(;B[ri]C[DS - This seems a more balanced approach.  The game has yet to be decided.]
))
(;B[fg]C[DS - This way black aims to settle things quickly without letting white build too big a wall.]
;W[gf];B[eg];W[hh];B[ji];W[hj];B[jk];W[hl];B[jm]C[DS - Black simply draws back.  The white stones diminish black's prospects on the left side but equally the black stones do the same to white's prospects on the right.  White has built two walls facing each other in the center but black has already limited their usefulness.]
)))))
(;B[kd]C[DS - This hits white's standard weak point after building a wall opposite a low stone.]

(;W[jd];B[ke];W[je];B[kf]C[DS - If white pushes up the white stones become over concentrated.]
)
(;W[kc];B[ld]C[DS - Black erases the influence of the white wall.]
)))
(;W[qd]C[DS - This seems more natural since the right side has more potential than the top and white will end with sente to extend along the bottom.]
;B[pc];W[od];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[nc];W[lq]C[DS - I would be inclined to try something like this.  On the other hand, I often get into trouble in my own games by failing to secure my stones.]
))
(;B[of]C[DS - I wonder whether this is a better choice in this position?  Black has created a large sphere of influence on the left and then played away at R14 in order to limit white rather than try to further expand the black area.  Entering at R17 gives white to counter with a large moyo of his own.  Jumping to P14 seems more consistent with what has gone before.  If play continues along normal lines...]
;W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[ri]C[DS - White has a large prospective territory at the top although it needs at least another play to prevent black from invading in the future.  White would like to extend at M3 but the black stone at S11 limits white's ability to build a double-wing position.]
