E: good start for both sides so far.];W[ek];B[dl];W[gk];B[kp]
C[i must something be
done against the upcoming white moyo, but wonder where the rigth point is.

E: l4 is good enough.];W[mo];B[lp];W[mp];B[kq];W[lr]
(;B[kn]C[l2 first is forcing. W o3 defense will hurt your shimari a little, but that is acceptable for your invading group's increased safety.
j4 leaning move is also good, building yourself while reducing.]
;W[lm];B[hp]C[dangerous. j4 is far enough.];W[kr]C[W reacts submissively.he should push up.]
;B[ip];W[jq];B[fn];W[en];B[jl];W[km];B[jm];W[in]LB[hn:a]C[i think this is an overplay that let me take life much
more easy than a) did.

E you are right - you can capture l6, but you are already quite safe, and next h3 is big. W played poorly here.]
;B[hm];W[jj];B[kk];W[jn];B[jo];W[hq]
(;B[gp]C[good - otherwise W g4 is big sente.];W[gq];B[hk]C[this just helps W. you are already out at l9 - lean against the r10-r13 stones to add strength to your group, then take the last big point, k16.]
;W[qp]C[this is the drwback of my invasion in the white moyo, but
if i can manage the group, i was satisfied yet.

E: right. the successful invasion means you are ahead .];B[pp]
;W[qo];B[po];W[rn];B[qq]C[wrong direction. r7 is painful. it links W's weak groups. and you don't even get good eye shape for your corner.
The double hane is much better.
then if W takes your s7 stone, you get a much bigger corner.]
;W[qm];B[pn];W[rm];B[rq];W[rp];B[sp];W[ro];B[nr];W[nq];B[or]
C[you are alive even without  this move. but notice how successful W's r4 was.]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[hj]C[now that W's side is stronger, it means your invading group is weaker.]
;B[ik]C[if the centergroup was alive, i thougt, i was
leading, but i told the whole left to my territory hence...]
;W[bh]C[... i was very surprised by this move and did'nt  know how
to deal with it :(

E: this is W's right, because of his added strength around g9. defend once at d12, then take k16.]
;B[bg]C[asking for trouble... W will isolate your d14 stones and you are in trouble more than his b12-d12 stones.]
;W[dh];B[ej];W[fh];B[ge]C[not only W invaded, now he is also chasing you and will make more territory on the upper side while chasing - that is, in sente. he is using his influence around g9 optimally. that is why B d12 was better, W would connect at b14, and you play k16.]
;W[hc];B[gg];W[fi];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi]LB[gh:a]C[this was a clicko of mine, should have
been at a and then i would jump out next.];W[gh];B[hi];W[hg]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[ig];W[ih];B[ji];W[hh]C[W now has 2 heavy target to attack, right under his guns. so, there was no use to create the g11 group.]
;B[ki];W[if]C[h16 seals the capture and is better. this captures wouls end the game.]
;B[kj];W[bi];B[fr]C[it should break the
connection but didnt work

E: W connected correctly - this is standard tesuji for watari (connection on the edge) using shortage of liberties.]
;W[fs];B[fp];W[gr];B[mr];W[mq]LB[nm:a]C[treating at a) would be better i think
now.

E: a) is not a threat. if W ignores and you play m6, after W n6 you have to go back and protect against W l5, so W connects at n7.]
;B[hs];W[nm]C[W does not need this, as I said.];B[om];W[ln]
;B[ko];W[nn];B[ie]C[now if this group dies (and may be it does)
than i have to resign

E: looks like you get out.];W[gf];B[eg];W[di];B[dd]C[your kikashi moves when pressed to save a group are a strong part of your game.]
;W[cc];B[ff];W[fg];B[he];W[fe];B[fd];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff];B[gc]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[gb];B[gd];W[ic];B[jd];W[kb]C[is not as good i think, because i come out easy
now

E: you are already out, l18 guards that you don't take the upper side entire.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mc];W[jg];B[bj];W[cj]C[this loses sente.]
;B[ck];W[ci];B[fk];W[gl];B[rf];W[rg]C[time for territory evaluation.
very close game, W slight lead after komi.];B[re];W[el];B[dk]

E: true :)];B[pe];W[oi];B[oj];W[pj];B[oh];W[pi];B[nh];W[nj]

;B[bk];W[ae];B[bf];W[co];B[bo];W[ma];B[ob]C[not needed. if W r17, B s17 then q18.

to sum up : you get out of trouble well, but you can improve your vision so as not to get into them so often, and if to get in trouble - at your own choice and in a more controlled way.

Good luck !
