C[BVdb.: This is like the typical game I always play.

 Although it's a blitz game, I only made 2 or 3 reading mistakes. So I feel satisfied about this game. Yet I lost slightly.



I usually have the feeling I'm a little bit behind after opening. Also in this game, but usually these things make no difference after early midgame. Then things become even again.



But then in a 3th phase of the game, it turns out I underestimated the center slightly. ... The game becomes very even again.



The game keeps being close until somebody loses a group.



...

What usually helps me a lot:

reusable tricks and shapes, things that can help us all.



When you are not sure about something, please mention so. Or whenever you have a reference for something, do not hesitate to share it. Sometimes 10 persons have 10 different opinions. So even though I am certainly open for every opinion, I am also trying to verify and double check everything in all possible ways.

janr:
In general, it is not recommended to submit blitz games for review.  It is very easy for the reviewer to find some lementary mistakes that change the game, even if you believe you only made 3 reading mistakes (it's not true, as much of the game is based on reading (to decide whether you can do something or not), even very strong players make many reading mistakes).
Therefore, it is preferable to submit serious games where you get more feedback than things you know already.]

(;B[kq];W[cn]LB[dn:B][fp:A][eq:C]C[BVdb.:

I expected A or B.

but this can't be bad for white.

janr: it's a good move, an alternative is to play first the tsuke at C.  It makes black heavier, but in this situation, white has to think about his lower side stone.]

(;W[eq];B[dr];W[ep];B[er];W[bq]LB[fn:F][fo:D][go:E][fp:B][hp:G]
[ip:C][gr:A]C[BVdb.:

Somebody commented during the game that A is wrong, but B is correct



janr: yes, B is better I think.  With A, white can make a wall while B allows for the cut.
The big question is here whether white can make his stone at C useful.  If not, he has made a mistake in choice of the variation. (then the tsuke F3/E3 is necessery or the atari at E3 in the game is not correct.  If black can now cut and make whites stone useless (e.g. if black B, white D, black E, white F, black G follows), then C4 would have been better than E3 (black has sente here in contrast to (*1))

Bvdb:
I looked this up in a database, and he is right.
 (janr: yes, but is L3/J4 in the database?)
However I have a question about this. ... see variation.]
(;B[gr]C[Bram Vdb.:



Ok, white does build a lot of influence and the position of black is rather low, I guess white is ahead and my L3 idea turns out to be a bad one.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[go];B[jq];W[hp];B[gq];W[df]LB[qf:C][hn:B][ho:A]
C[janr: it may be better to protect the cut at A. either with B directly or with some more distant move such as C]
;B[jd]LB[pj:A][ho:B]C[janr: I would prefer A which both builds a moyo and prepares the cut at B (making the fight harder for white due to the influence)]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[nc]LB[qc:B][nd:C][oe:D][pf:A]C[Bram Vdb.:



A: simple and most common joseki. But is it correct ???



B: at the moment I had the idea that B would be a slight overplay, but now that I look at it B looks like a very strong move.



C: same, I would think C cannot be played when white is strong in the upper left corner.



D: the move I never play, leaves too much aji to my taste.

janr: I don't like D either.  I like B.  I think C and A are playable, but probably one is slightly better than the other (there is a whole theory about choosing A or C, but I think white's upper left corner is not the most important issue).]
;B[pf]LB[qc:B][pg:A]C[BVdb.:



Here white should play A before B.

janr: I don't think omitting A is necessarily bad if white wants the corner and a fight on the upper side.]

(;W[qc];B[pc]C[BVdb.:



Here white can still play Q13 to capture the 2 black stone]

(;W[qd]LB[pe:B][qe:A]C[BVdb.:



A is wrong, B is correct.

janr: usually A is better. (see also variation)  But i dont know the correct sequence with O17/K16 present at these exact intersections.]

(;B[qe];W[re];B[pe];W[rf];B[qg]LB[pb:B][qg:A]C[BVdb.: Another mistake.



I should play B here instead. Also A is not that, I worried too much about the cutting point.


janr: yes, i think A is too slow];W[hn]LB[qb:A]C[Bvdb.: A bit overdefensive I think ?

janr: getting a complete (strong) shape is important.  Compare with a black cut in conjunction with the black moyo on the right.  after this overdefensive slow move, white has a moyo on the left and is strong (therefore able to attack invading stones), while also strong enough to support invasions of the black moyo on the right.]

[hd:E][he:G][cj:F]TR[kc]C[janr:

I think it is better for white to use the strong wall and attack the invading black stone (at F e.g.)


bvdb:

A and D = are too defensive and only does half the job done.



B and C help white and leaves invasion points at the triangled point.



I took E just to make quick shape.

janr:
E is an attachment, usually good fod making life (but black is not weak here), or fighting (but there is nothing to attack).
Among, the different choices you consider, G is missing.  It is the normal move to make shape and make a moyo/influence.]
;B[hd]C[janr: the disadvantage of this move is that White's corner gets strong.]

(;W[id]LB[ie:A][ch:B]C[BVdb.:



Although A can support B a bit, the center does not look interesting enough to me.]

(;B[ic];W[ie];B[he]C[BVdb.: Actually this is a missread.



I seemed to remember that a nobi could break the ladder.

But my opponent stretched correctly once more.];W[if];B[gc]

(;W[jc]C[janr: the proverb advises white to increase a sacrifice of one stone to two stones (see variation)]
;B[hb];W[kd]LB[pk:A]C[
janr: by not sacrificing one more stone, white failed to capture the black stone unconditionally.  The geta does not work here.

BVdb.: Here I'm thinking about playing A later on, but I figured white would ignore A for now. see variation]

(;B[bf]C[Bram Vdb.:



Judging the current situation,

I would say: black is ahead, but the game is only starting of course ...

janr: it is a good idea to strengthen c12.  However, now the white stones can move out easily (with the attachment which is good for making shape), so E12 would be better locally I think.

As white failed to attach C12, his wall is ineffective and he is behind.]
;W[dh]LB[ce:B][cg:A][di:C]C[BVdb:

I didn't want to play A, because it does not look efficient with B.

So I played B first.

janr: even if you would not choose it eventually, considering C is very natural here.]
;B[ce]LB[cg:A][dg:B][di:C]C[janr: what happens if white resists?
I believe the problems of the variation can be avoided by exchanging A for B or by playing C.  later in the game you can still play C15 and hope white will docily answer at D15.]

(;W[de];B[ci]LB[bf:C][eh:B][di:A]C[BVdb:



So here I got what I wanted.

janr: but is it good?  White can now push at A, and get influence working together with his wall.  It still prefer B to C.]

(;W[qn]LB[di:A]C[BVdb.:



Here I was a bit surprised. In my opinion this is bad timing for white. White cannot allow Black A in sente.]
;B[di];W[eh];B[op]LB[di:A]C[BVdb.:



"A" really kills a lot of potential in my opinion. So at this point I had the feeling it would be hard for white to catch up in territory.]
;W[qj]LB[pe:B][ql:A]C[BVdb.:



I shouldn't let my feelings take over, but A looks too risky while B is starting to look heavy.]
;B[mc]LB[oh:A]C[BVdb.:



I realize that white can capture my stone, but on the other hand I will reinforce while sacrificing ... so entering midgame.

janr: 
* I disagree and think white can not capture this stone. (see variation)
* This moves seems to try to reinforce black because he has no eyes.  But it also reinforces white.  
I would prefer a shape-making move such as A white protects the cut and attacks white below at the same time.]

(;W[oj]C[BVdb.: The ladder does not count anymore., so k18 looks like good timing.



On the other hand, now that I look at it, maybe I should have played it a lot earlier. Because it looks like white can play J18 in sente, so that makes it sente for both.]
;B[jb];W[kc];B[md]LB[ke:A][gg:B][oh:D][fi:C]C[securing but also looking at the aji of A

B is only good in exceptional cases.  Here, given blacks wall on the right, making influence with A is clearly better.  White B / black C may follow, and black would get both territory and influence.  If white chooses another move (C or D) the cut at E is annoying.]

Black becomes heavy and not alive yet.

I played A to settle, not to run to the center ...

If I just want to run to the center, then why play A first?

So, I have no interest in C.



2) What if black responds by playing D?


janr: first, the moves suggested for white seem bad.  I don't like the forcing move at G2.  Black can just connect and get stronger by the exchange.  .

1) A is to settle and get eyes.  A and C are both good points.  Getting both A and C is still better than only getting A.
