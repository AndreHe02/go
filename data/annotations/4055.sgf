C[Hi there!

This is the most recent game I played, still, I recorded it from memory and am almost sure that the order of moves in the endgame isn't correct, so don't mind this point, please.
The game was a relatively fast one at my club, where I decided to test my 2-kyu. :)
Though I won by resignation, leading by almost 40 points by my count, I feel that my opponent simply missed several opportunities or played slow and timid moves when there was no need to do so.
I reckon that my play is full of oversights and bad moves, as I'm not that bad at fast games, there have to be other reasons for them.

I've gone over the game myself briefly, but of course every piece of advice is welcome and will be carefully studied. :)
My own comments are preceded by "fey".

Best wishes,

Nadja Sommerfeld
(2ndtry@gmx.de)];B[dq]C[fey: Naturally, as I took the white stones here, the game is recorded from White's point of view.

CG: This is off topic, but D3 as the first move is considered impolite. If black choses komoku for his first move, he should play it on C4.]
;W[dd];B[qp];W[pd];B[co];W[op];B[mq];W[no];B[qm];W[qq];B[pq]
;W[pp];B[oq];W[qo];B[rp];W[qn]C[CG: It's surprising how many (even stronger) kyu players do not know this move and play S5 instead.]
;B[rq];W[pm];B[nc];W[jc]C[fey: A play on the right side seemed unappealing due to the aji left in R7, or was I just overly scared?

CG: Of course R7 still has aji, but this does not mean the right side is unimportant. I would not like to encourage a black kakari around F17 (since the left looks unappealing to me) so I would also like to play a pincer. But I don't think Q14 would be a bad move.

Playing the low pincer makes a follow-up more urgent (I would not like a black boshi or kata-tsuki) - so I would prefer K16 or L16.]
;B[qf];W[oe]C[CG: I'm not sure which move is correct here - O16, Q15 or Q14. But Q15 looks ok.]
;B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pg]C[CG: I would rather play P13. If black plays tenuki, you have the sente move R12 (threatening S15), and if plack answers at R12, there is less aji compared to the actual game. But I can understand you want to get sente to play K15.]
;B[qg];W[je]C[fey: This move looks somewhat unusual, black seems to have lots of possibilities left for later; but I aimed at developing a moyo on top on a larger scale, so this was probably the price I had to pay.
Still, the timing of black exploiting the aji there seems important. If he plays there right now, I'll just chase him out by building up a moyo on the left, if he waits to long, the possibilities may be gone. Hm.

CG: I can understand your reasoning, but playing tenuki here is painful. My feeling is that something went wrong before - either K17 (wouldn't you like it on K16 now?) or Q13.]
;B[cf];W[ch]C[CG: I don't like this pincer. Your focus is the top, not the left. What would you answer if black plays E14 now?
I would rather play D14, F16 or even C16.];B[cc]C[fey: This looks just perfect for White! Possibly he should have jumped to D14 instead? I he gets to counterpincer my C12, he starts to stake out an even bigger moyo on the bottom...

CG: If I were black, I would play E14. Yes, this looks perfect for white!]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[df];W[ce];B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[ef]C[fey: E14 was played reflex-like, bothering to take the corner now just seemed slow here. Merely a "feeling" move.

CG: B17 is worth about 25 points - I think taking the corner would be the correct move. But of course E14 is also very big.]
;B[dh]
(;W[di]C[CG: This invites black to take the vital point E13. I don't think it's wise to pull out the white stone immediately.]
;B[eg]C[fey: Ok, here is where I think both me and Black misplayed somehow. F14 is clearly vital here, but I didn't dare to play here because of my weak stones on the left.

CG: Well, this is inconsistent. You should handle the two stones lightly. If you play F14, what are you afraid of? Is there something better than the cut?]

(;W[cl]
(;B[ei];W[dj];B[ej]C[fey: And this is his mistake, I guess, because he can F14 for free and this b47 wasn't really sente against my group.

CG: Yes, black should still play F14.];W[ff]C[fey: I was happy again at this point :)]
;B[el];W[dm];B[dk];W[ck];B[em];W[cn]C[CG: This is bad shape - extending at D6 is better.]
;B[do]C[CG: Yes, this shuts white in and is very big.];W[nq]
C[CG: This looks strange. If your group on the left side is already alive, B17 and M5 are the urgent moves.]
;B[nr];W[mp];B[lq];W[qr];B[pr]C[fey: I know there's ko aji here, but during the game, I didn't remember the exact sequence (which I looked up later) and therefore left position as it was.

CG: Black is very happy to get N3 and M3 - I think O3 was too early.]
;W[ip]C[CG: This looks like an overplay - playing such an invasion is dangerous if you have a moyo. Black can reduce it easily while attacking your stone.]
;B[jo];W[hn];B[jm];W[hl];B[jk];W[fk];B[ek];W[ik];B[kj]C[CG: This is a strange move - black should extend to K10.]
;W[ii];B[mj]C[CG: Black is playing neutral points. This way the white invasion was a success.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[ro];B[rr];W[qh];B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[qj]C[fey: R11 seems better, I don't  remember my exact resoning for not playing there.]
;B[rh];W[ri]C[CG: Connecting still looks better.];B[pf];W[mf]
;B[og]C[fey: This surprised me, along with black's whole last moves. When I asked him about this sequence after the game, he told me he was afraid that I'd cut his K5 stones off and aimed at connecting them, but in fact it looks like terribly aji-keshi with regards to the white position on the top, and like a rather slow way of playing.
Couldn't he have defended at least by cutting off J4?

CG: Yes, black must not be afraid.];W[bc]C[fey: This isn't a move I'm proud of...
Still, it's a fairly big gote play, but I have to admit I lacked a definite plan here.

CG: Well, this is a VERY large move. You both should have played there before.]
;B[hp];W[iq]C[CG: Have you read out what happens if black cuts at J5?]

(;B[hq];W[io];B[lg];W[kf];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[ih]C[fey: Besides, this is the point from which on I can't guarantee the right order of moves. Sorry for that!]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[hh];B[ig];W[hg];B[jg];W[hf]
(;B[ne]C[fey: This didn't work out well for Black. I wonder if there was a better way to exploit the aji here, maybe starting with M14?

CG: M14 looks better, but if white is willing to give away one stone, there is no real problem. I think the game is already decided.]

;W[bh];B[bj];W[bk];B[bg];W[ah];B[cg];W[cj]C[fey: This sequence left me feeling relieved. I got the akward feeling that there was a better way to play for Black here, maybe his initial move of B5 wasn't that good?]
;B[om];W[pl];B[on];W[nl]C[fey: I guess I misread here, though I managed to somehow cut my losses.]

;B[gj];W[ij];B[fj];W[hk];B[gn];W[qi]C[fey: Black resigned here, beeing behind by quite a lot.
The result of this game surprised me, I haven't been playing 2-kyu for more than two weeks now and am still very doubtful about my rating. This game certainly didn't help me to make a decision. :/

Still, I'd be glad to hear your opinion about my moves and thank you in advice for taking the time to review my game.
I'm especially interested in some strategic pointers, as tactics naturally suffer when playing a fast game, but feel free to comment on anything you notice.]
