C[Brian: Thank you for reviewing this game I had between me and a 2D, it ended surprisngly close for how I normally play so I thought it would be a good game to review, I thought the middle game of this was good, so I would appreciate if you placed an emphasis on that. However of course, I am sure I made many mistakes throughout the whole game.
Once again thank you for your time and effort.];B[pd];W[dp]

(;W[re];B[rf];W[qe];B[qf];W[nq];B[cf];W[bf];B[eb]C[Brian: During the game I didn't expect this move to be sente, but I did feel a bit uncomfortable leaving it alone.

This is quite big move, just feels to slow, if white adds same move at the bottom black is behind for sure.]

I do not really like it, you  just get weak group and nothing else. I would just play F3 or F4 because of better follow ups.]

It isn't bad but you could probably try to attack white on bigger scale.]

Also watch our for moves that does nothing and helps your opponent to get points(for example F3) as everything is exchange and we do not like bad exchanges.]
