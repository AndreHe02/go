Jeff: Hi.  I have gone through the game a few times and would like to answer your question about shape.  Shape is a foundation, therefore it is made as an attack or a defense.  Once fighting is happenig, shape may not be the highest priority.  But going into a fight with good shape is beneficial.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[dp];W[qp];B[qn]C[Jeff: This is not normally played. P3 or P4 would be expected.]
;W[oq]C[Jeff: I would play P4 here.  R6 is not threatened by P3.]
;B[mq]C[Jeff: Here White has 2 black stones near a strong white group.  White can lean on one then attack the other.

The following branches are some ideas on how to handle this general position.]
(;W[qf];B[qh]C[Jeff: Now that black has played here, white does not have the same options because R6 has some backup now.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[pf]C[Jeff: A strange move by black.  White should look to make black overconcentrate.  Here white's job is not so much to make good shape, but to give black bad shape.]

;W[np]C[Jeff: This is greedy,.  I understand trying to seperate the two groups, but black has little to worry about.]
;B[nq];W[no];B[po];W[qq];B[lc]C[Jeff: THis is a mistake by black.  He would do better to play C14.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[jd]C[Jeff: K17 is better.]

(;W[nc]C[Jeff: This is a good examle of bad shape.  O18 is better.  See branch.]
;B[lb]C[Jeff: THe marked stone hurts white to the left.  N18 was not a good play for this reason.]
;W[na];B[sb];W[qa];B[pb];W[ob];B[og];W[mf]C[Jeff: THis is a bad move. L14 is not an interesting stone.  The white group is alive.  C14 would be bigger here, or C16.]
;B[fd];W[ec];B[fc];W[df];B[ff];W[ge];B[fe];W[gh];B[eg]C[Jeff: Now the white group at the top is in trouble.  N14 should have been used to support it.]
(;W[fg];B[ef]C[Jeff: F13 is a thank-you move.  Black is very excited to play E14 for free.]

[cq:C][jq:B]C[Jeff: Ok, big time in the game here. WHite needs to make a big move.  G10 is a bad cutting spot.  O4 is a weak two stones.  Black has prospects on the right and lower sides.  White needs to fix all 4 of these problem areas.

A is probably not a good invasion
B looks promising do to the N3 group being a little weak.
C would grab a huge chunk of territory.  Probably a secondary consideration right now.
D has some interesting prospects, but like A it seems a little too "black" in that area of the board.

I would choose B and hope to both live on the bottom in some way, and while attacking the black group, also strengthen the O4 group.  Once the O4 group is strong, I could choose between D and C next.]
;W[ng]C[Jeff: This is not an interesting spot.];B[nh]C[Jeff: Now black is even stronger on the right side.]
(;W[gk]C[Jeff: H9 is a little farther into the center and probably a better connection.  But good play for seeing this important part of the board.]
;B[hj];W[hk]C[Jeff: THis is a good play, it should have been there before]
