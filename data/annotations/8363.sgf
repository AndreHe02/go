C[P: Hi, my name is Peter, and I'm 3k on kgs. This is quite an interesting game to review, and most of my comments have to do with the strategy of the two players, though I will also comment on some of the fighting. I mostly use english terms, but any japanese terms I use can be found on Sensei's library. I use W for white, and B for black.

The most striking thing about this game to me is that W never had a clear strategy and in the early game, scattered stones around that didn't seem to have much relation to each other. This lead to W  having no territory and several weak groups by mid game, while b was strong everywhere and had considerable territory. But from the beginning of the mid game on, black lost ground in every single exchange, almost without exception, to finally lose by less than ten points. Quite a dramatic turn around.

You both play quite well and are fairly evenly matched. I elaborate on this more at the end, but I expect that future games will go to the player who can best learn about go strategy.]
PM[2]FG[259:];B[dd];W[po];B[dp];W[pc];B[dj]
(;W[pq]C[P:  Already, w's stones are inconsistent. The stone played at q5 strongly emphasizes influence along the right side, and the usual strategy is to invite b to play in around q3 and then press on that stone to gain thickness. 

This strategy would be consistent with the w stone in the upper right. But making the enclosure, especially the high enclosure, emphasizes extension along the bottom side -- but there is no w stone there, and it is b's turn to play! This makes the bottom side ideal for b to play in, and w's stones would not be doing as much as they could. See variation for another idea for w here.]
;B[qf]C[P: this move by b is fine, but in my opinion, the bottom is the biggest area. W could even ignore this stone to play the f3 approach.]
;W[pe]C[P: Again, w play a sequence that emphasizes building thickness along the top, but it seems unlikely that w will have sente to play there first. This sequence is generally reserved for when there are already stones around f17 and k16.]
;B[pf]C[P: B plays to deny w the thickness...];W[pj]C[P: This move seems to be intended to deny the b stones a base, but it doesn't do that at all. It violates that proverb -- don't play towards thickness! The two b stones are thick, and playing a lone stone near them in this way means that w is creating a potential weak group for themselves. Wq10 doesn't claim any territory, either, since b can easily invade. And the right side is small right now anyway.

The b stones are not at all threatened by this, because they can still slide into the corner or make another move against the weak q15 stone.]
(;B[rd]C[P: calm, steady play by b. I suggest a more active play though, like playing the wrap-around at p15 to confine the w stones. See the variation]
;W[qc]C[P: This move is extemely small. B has settled their stones, and could now approach from the other direction, around k17, and w's corner would have no prospects for expansion.

The needed move here is o16 or n16, to get up to the fourth line and begin making territory.]
;B[oe];W[od];B[ne];W[nd];B[me];W[lc];B[ic]C[P: If b would rather take a big point than play the important press at l16, then b needs to be sure that they are taking the biggest point. The upper side at this point is very small, but the bottom is still huge. As well, splitting the w stones around q8 would be very satisfying.]
;W[fc]C[P: this move seems a bit thoughtless. What is it trying to do? Attack the black stone? All black has to do is close the corner at e17 and it is the w stone that is being attacked. W is just giving themselves a weak group by playing this way.]
(;B[ie]C[P: this is too soon. Best to close the corner first. See variation.]
;W[cf]C[P: This is a good play -- I was imagining that w was looking to jump in at c17 afterwards]
;B[ee]
(;W[ci]C[P: This is a 'thank-you' move, because it invites b to strengthen their position at c10, a move that makes w's position weak and cramped, while b gets a wall facing their corner stone. Best to just jump to the corner at c17 or w will just be left with a weak group and no territory. See variation]
;B[cj]C[P: be sure to see how good this two-move exchange is for b and how w gets nothing]
;W[cn]C[P: Now what? is w trying to attack the thick position again? After creating two weak groups with no base?]
;B[co]C[P: Good.];W[fq];B[dn];W[eo];B[do];W[dq];B[cq];W[ep]
;B[fm]C[P: this move is where b starts to fall behind. There are too many unresolved positions to begin staking out a moyo. This move is small and doesn't really do anythign at this point. Better to close the corner around c16, likely killing both f17 and c14. B might also want to think about how to stop w from exterting more control over the bottom (notice how well the f3 stones work with the q3 enclosure?) Bl3 would be huge. bf7 just forces w to make another move on the bottom.]
;W[jp]C[P: W's moyo now extends arcross the bottom and right hand side and will be difficult to reduce.]
(;B[hq]C[P: Play away from thickness, goes the proverb. Consider the variation.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[hr];B[ho];W[gp];B[jq];W[ir];B[jo]
;W[kp]C[P: this sequence simply helps w seal up fourth line territory. The fourth line is often called the line of victory -- so don't push your opponent along the fourth line if you can avoid it! B seems so preoccupied with gbuilding a centre moyo that they don't mind w sealing up thirty points of solid territory on the bottom. 

But centre moyos are deceiving. it's far easier to control territory on the side, and when you end up betting the game on closing up a single, large territory, the odds are against you. You need to successfully defend against every invasion, whereas you opponent need succeed only once to leave you with nothing. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket by trying for the single large moyo this way. The wall will never even begin to equal the thirty points it cost.]
;B[ko];W[lp];B[pl]C[P: Good job b! Build up thickness all over the board, then attack. Perfect use of the two walls.]
;W[og];B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[rk];W[qk];B[ql];W[rj];B[nl]
C[P: Why let w capture the s9 stone in sente this way? Best to simply connect. Connecting also threatens w's corner, leaves w with no eyes and b with no weaknesses.]
;W[nj];B[mg];W[nh];B[sj];W[qj];B[sk]C[P: unneccessary. Jump up before reaching down.]
;W[lj];B[mh];W[mi];B[mk];W[mj];B[ng];W[oi]C[P: Oops! B forced w to play on the critical point, giving them 2 eyes. This is the point b would have needed. Avoid playing unneccessary forcing moves -- especially when it helps your opponent!]
;B[kh]C[P: this move does nothing. Close the corner at c16, attach at q2]
;W[jj];B[di]C[P: right area, wrong move. w could just hop into the 3-3 point now and steal the corner.]
;W[ch]C[P: w should just jump into the corner, rather than taking a weak group heere. the corner is even larger than the side here.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bg];W[cg];B[bf]C[P: It is a mistake to play b14. b13 was an excellent move that left w with only one eye. But pushing this way just forces w to strengthen their position while cutting into b's. Leave moves like this for later -- Jump up before reaching down! Seal the group in at e13 instead and it would be dead.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[bc]C[P: notice how the b14 push was gote?]
;W[eg];B[ff]C[P: wrong direction. b is pushing w's weak group towards safety.]
;W[fg];B[fj];W[gg];B[gf]C[P: b is responding to a threat that does not exist.]
;W[bj];B[bk];W[ai];B[hg]C[P: w could simply live by playing b12 now. if you want to have any attack, b needs to play b12]
;W[gi]
(;B[gj]C[P: Again, b pushes w towards safety. see variation]
;W[hi]C[P: it is best for w to simply live now, taking away the aji of b12 -- it may not be sente just now, but it will become sente later.]
;B[ki]C[P];W[kj];B[ij];W[ii];B[ji];W[hj];B[ik];W[hk];B[il];W[hl]
;B[im];W[fl];B[el]C[P: this is a fight over nothing. whoever stops playing here first and takes a big point is the winner.]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[gn];B[mn]C[p: connecting in gote like this is painful, considering it was b who was making the attack]
;W[kl];B[ln]C[P: doubly painful];W[no];B[ro];W[om];B[ol];W[qn]
;B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[rq];B[qp];W[pp];B[pm];W[nn];B[pn];W[qo]
;B[on];W[nm];B[mm]C[P: and yet a third move required to connect, while w seals up a huge corner.]
;W[oo];B[dc];W[hb]C[P: this is hopeless for w];B[ib];W[eb];B[db]
;W[hc];B[ec];W[fb];B[ea];W[id];B[jd];W[hd];B[jc];W[kb];B[ia]
;W[ig];B[if];W[hh];B[je]C[P: In the endgame, both players make gote moves before sente moves, and make unneccessary moves to join live groups together. But up until the sequence around b9, there are no serious mistakes. It is very, very close right now. 

W played sloppily and without clear direction, but was able to fight strongly to regain lost ground. B played calmly and solidly, not allowing any weakness, but was too passive and missed all of their opportunities to take big points or kill weak groups. The game is a tossup at this point, and w wins because they have a slightly stronger yose, continuing to play much more assertively than b and getting the better slice of every area.

Both players have very different strengths, and a future game would go to the one who can most improve their strategic sense -- to play in the most important areas of the board.

Each turn, ask yourselves, 1) do I have any weak groups? If so, strengthen them. 2) Does my opponent have any weak groups? If so, attack them. 3) If neither, look for the biggest point and play it. Many moves in this game seem to be attacks on strong groups, or are taking small points rather than attacking a weak enemy group. Applying this simple formula will greatly strengthen your play. 

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me.
