C[Dankna(w) vs. Shuichi(b)

Review by no2k:
It was a nice game with a lot of fighting in the end.  You both should take care of the 3-3 points. You can count a successful invasion by ca. 20 to 30 points difference. So defending the corner in the middle game is important.]
;B[dj];W[jk]C[dankna: I need to learn more about the 4-3 point, so I played it.
no2k: But you must be aware, that the josekis are designed for the 19x19 board. The main reason why josekis are designed for a specific dimanesion of a board is the value of influence.]
;B[dd];W[jd];B[gc];W[hg]C[no2k: This is very ambitious. Note that L11 is open. Because black has a stone at G11 you cannot do much with the resulting influence if black invades there.]
;B[gf]C[no2k: It's not easy to make territory in the center. A proverb says: There is no territory in the center.]
;W[gi];B[ie]C[shuichi: Trying to claim the top and separate potential groups.
no2k: It's good to have a plan!];W[je]C[no2k: Good. Solidifying the position, and taking territory on the right.]
;B[gg]C[shuichi: defending desired territory.
no2k: It's mostly not a good idea to play play one single stone (J9), forcing the opponent to strengthen his position, (Two connected stones are strong), and tennuki then.
What about black J8? This connects also to the G8 stone.];W[fk]
C[dankna: Neither of us knows much about how the joseki in the left corner can proceed from here.
no2k: Good move here. A 2 stone extension from a stone on the 3rd line is safe. A 3 stones extension from a stone on the 3rd line like this one can be cut, but the G5 stone helps the connection.]
;B[hh]C[shuichi: the upper territory seemed to be in the greatest   danger. Also it was my prioritized section. I decided   to push white to the right.
no2k: If he answers.];W[ih]C[no2k: Good move.];B[ig]C[shuichi: Again. I was separating groups and getting rid of   potential threats]

(;W[hf]C[no2k: This does not work. Better to play at K7. Let your opponent have that one (useless) stone. See Var]
;B[he];W[dl]C[no2k: I wouldstill  prefer K7. Try to imagine how much territory remains, if black plays K6 and L7.]
;B[ii]C[shuichi: Trying to extend my territory further. If he extended   right I would gain influence at the bottom. If he   guarded the bottom I would secure the top area   further.]
;W[jh];B[ij]C[no2k: This is risky. The 2 stones can be separated.]
;W[ik]C[dankna: first contain...
no2k: Perhaps H5 is a stronger move. This nearly kills the 2 black stones.]
;B[hk]C[no2k: Better to connect.];W[hi]C[dankna: ...then separate
no2k: Good!];B[gh];W[hj];B[fi]C[shuichi: Trying to gain sente
dankan: You already had it in my opinion];W[gj];B[fj]C[shuichi: trying to secure the left side for myself]
;W[gk];B[ek];W[el];B[hl]C[shuichi: Possibly take more of the left side; distract   opponent.]
;W[dk]C[dankna: Take advantage of play which I don't need to respond to immediately to possibly gain more space in the corner.
no2k: Seems good to me.];B[ej];W[fl]C[dankna: But now I do need to respond.]
;B[jc]C[shuichi: With sente I decide to tenuki to gain more territory   on the right]
;W[kc]C[no2k: Calm and good. Takes the corner.];B[id]C[no2k: Not a good move. Bettrr to play at J11, helping the K11 stone.]
;W[cj]C[dankna: Hey, it worked.  Surprise.
no2k: Playing at the top right and the bottom left are miai. One of you gets to play there, the other takes the other point.]
;B[ci];W[bj];B[kd]C[shuichi: I felt that that section was safe enough and so I   tenuki'd.
no2k: This seems unreasonable to me, but one has to read out the situation carefully. On the other hand, white has the nasty move at B6.]

(;W[jg]C[dankna: I'll lose the corner altogether unless I strengthen my connection.
no2k: The corner is still yours. Try the variation.];B[if];W[ke]
;B[ld];W[jb];B[ic];W[lc];B[jf];W[kf]C[dankna: I could have played m9, but I believe that would have left me unable to connect.  Although perhaps ending this more swiftly would have let me get more territory on the top, I judged the territory on the right more important because it was surer.
no2k: Good move. With M9 black could separate your groups, yes.]
;B[kg]C[shuichi: threatening both groups.
no2k: There is nothing to fear by white.];W[le]C[dankna: Would have liked to play j12, but had to threaten now or be pushed against the edge.]
;B[ib]C[shuichi: realized I couldn't take the bottom group so I   defended again.
no2k: This is small compared to B5.];W[ja]C[no2k: L12 is good form. It enables you to play J13, bH13, wK13 and bF12.]
;B[ia]C[no2k: Now you have to answer.];W[lb]C[no2k: Better to connect solidly at K12.]
;B[la]C[shuichi: Possible capture later on.
no2k: B5 is urgent.];W[cc]C[dankna: Possible capture was only worth a few points; invading here is worth more, and I know shuichi is watching and would have moved to block it as soon as he thinks I am going to invade.  Black's thickness after the joseki won't matter to me because I see no way to invade the center anyway.
no2k: Also very big.];B[cd]C[shuichi: Fell into the Three Point Invasion joseki. Was   confident as I had support on the right.
dankna: Was aware of the support on the right and didn't know specifically what effect it would have, but trusted my reasoning ability to figure it out when it became important.]
;W[dc]C[no2k: This is risky. But it is a little complicated.]
;B[ec];W[eb];B[fb]C[shuichi: With the other stone there I felt this drastic move   would work.
dankna: I've played a similar sequence against the computer many times and knew I couldn't do anything to threaten the stone at f12.
no2k: Good black move.];W[bd];B[be]
(;W[ad]C[no2k: This is wrong. The correct move is B12. See Veriation.]
;B[ce]C[shuichi: Setting up to try and kill his group
dankna: It's already alive, so this just gives me a chance to reduce the central territory more.  Better would have been the sequence a9-b11-c9 or a9-b11-c8.
no2k: Wite can make life with B12 now. This is good enough to win the game.]
;W[ae]C[no2k: B12!];B[bb]C[shuichi: Trying to eliminate eye potential.
no2k: This is the vital point of this formation.]
(;W[cb]C[no2k: This does not work. B11 is a must. See var.]
;B[bc]C[shuichi: blocking the connection];W[af]C[dankna: Gain two more liberties, only safe answer is b7, then I will win a race to capture the black group b11/b12 should it come to that.
no2k: That gains ONE mor liberty. A better move is B8. If black plays A11 you simply connect.]

(;B[bg]C[shuichi: Using the net to trap him.
no2k: You have to count the liberties. You both have 3. So you have no time for a geta. The best moves are shown in the variation.]
;W[ba]C[dankna: Well, I don't see a threat I can make so I'd better take a liberty immediately.
no2k: This leaves a nasty possibility for black. Better at A12.]

(;B[ea]C[shuichi: Realized I had not enough liberties so  I set out to   minimize damage.
no2k: There is a nasty move for black. It is A12. Try the variation.]
;W[ab]C[dankna: d13 and d12 would have been disastrous for me.
no2k: Good reading.];B[db];W[ac];B[ag]C[shuichi: The bottom would be harder to defend than the side   if he decided to extend.
no2k: I do not see any territory on the left side. B5 is a better move. It threatens B3.]
;W[bi]C[dankna: Threatening d5, must therefore respond with c6, so I can continue to push upward.]
;B[ch];W[ah]C[nmo2k: What purpose?];B[bh]C[no2k: Very small. K12 is bigger.]
;W[ai];B[kb]C[shuichi: With not a whole left to do I secured the capture]
;W[md]C[dankna: Playing it safe.];B[kk]C[shuichi: I realized I had insufficient moku and decide to   invade.
no2k: This is the vital point. Try it.];W[kj]C[dankna: Intuition.
no2k: Good move.];B[lk];W[lj];B[jl];W[il];B[im]C[shuichi: With sente I could easily form two eyes]
;W[jj]
(;B[km]C[no2k: Perhaps M2 forms 2 eyes. Now there is only a nakade. M2 kills black. K1 is only a false eye. See var.]
