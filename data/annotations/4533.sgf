(;B[iq]C[J3 is strange, this move is often played when there is a black stone at D4, forming the mini chinese pattern, but now the lower side is white area so you want to settle your group early, not to build a moyo. 
The normal joseki starting with q2 is natural here];W[qj];B[ce]
;W[oc]
(;B[pe]C[This is a solid move which aim at an extension on the right side and at a pressing move or pincer against P17. Since there is already a white stone on the right side it loses its effectiveness, a simple extension at r13 is better]
