C[Hi, thanks for reviewing this game.

I am playing Black.

--

Hi, I have made my notes throughout, below two dashes like this one.  Please let me know if you have any questions or notice any mistakes.

C[This trickmove... I have only read about in books, but never tried it in practice.

I wanted to give it a try for once.

Here I would force once more at F7.  White could ignore it and capture the G3 stone, but this seems like a bad trade, so most likely the result will be F7, D8, F4, and then continuing as in the game, but the b stones have a better shape.]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[gr]
(;W[fm]C[--

This seems to be a mistake, see the variation at H2.];B[hp]
;W[go];B[gn];W[ho]C[At this point I started using my time.

"How to continue?"

--

Due to the move that w made at F7, b has time to play this "driving tesuji" and then capture at E2.

This is why F7 was a mistake: it looked like sente but actually was not because of this sequence, so b ends up with quite a large corner.]
;B[hn];W[io];B[er]C[After using a couple of minutes I ran into the conclusion that this move will capture the white cutting stones.

I like the result here for black, large corner and breached through the white wall.

--

Yes, this is a very nice result.];W[gm];B[in];W[ip]
(;B[mq]C[My aim was to nullify white's thickness while protecting the corner.

--

Not a bad idea, but then w can play K6, which seems a very obvious and nice move for w.  If your opponent has an obvious response to a move, maybe you should look for a better move, or play the obvious response yourself in some cases.

In this case K6 seems to me a better move than N3, simply because it is such a nice move for white.]
;W[jn];B[hl]C[This seemed like the best move for moving out at the time.]
;W[cl]C[When I saw this move, I had already made my decision.

Whatever happens, I will give up B7 stones, as E3 are the true key stones attacking my group.

--

"Whatever happens" is a dangerous idea, you should always keep looking for opportunities.  Sometimes it is better not to have a plan.

In this case, B9 is big later on, and the w stones are not completely alive, but they are much better off than they were.  C8 was a really big move.

How should b deal with the left side now?  It seems like that is the main question for b here.

B9 right now seems too small, but there b needs to play somewhere in the top and left part of the board.  Maybe N17 or so would be a good idea now.]
;B[mc]C[--

OK, you had the same idea. :-)];W[ob]C[This move was new for me.

It has never come up in any of my games before.

--

It is a good way to split.

W feels confident in the top and left area of the board, and wants to create an opportunity for fighting, which could help turn the left side into territory.

An interesting idea here for b might be F17.  It is not clear what the result would be, but it would make a difficult situation for white.  Black needs to just get some solid living group in this area, whereas w may need to kill something.]
;B[jc]C[I thought he was aiming at my N17 stone, so I decided to defend it.

--

I think this is a good idea.

F17 next would be very nice, but w should play there first.  Then the issue of the left side is still troublesome for b.]
(;W[gc]C[When we reviewed this game together, my opponent said

"This position is perfect for white. Black has failed."

I didn't think so, but... what do you think?

--

I agree, this is a nice result for w.

When w played at C8, this looks like an optimal result he might have gotten.

The problem now for b is that the left side is almost entirely sealed off by w, using very few stones.

Because of the weakness of the stones at K17-N17, black cannot comfortably invade on the left side, so this is a difficult situation.]
;B[pf]C[--

This promises to weaken black's top group even further.  This is something out of a joseki book perhaps, but in this position it seems to be a mistake.

Of course from the perspective of the right side, this looks great for b.  However at this time I think the problem with the top group and the left side is critical.

An alternative to this move would be O15, and the idea would be to try to attack the two white stones which do not have a base, while strengthening the top group, and then use that strength to deal with the situation on the left side.]
;W[ne];B[cc]C[--

This must be a mistake.

The two stones are weaker then ever, and you cannot have yet another weak group here.

Of course, if this is part of some subtle sacrifice strategy then maybe it is brilliant... but to me it looks like you are trying to make a living group in the corner and that cannot be good.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]C[--

A mistake, should just be F17 here.];B[ed];W[fc];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bb];W[ad];B[bc]
(;W[db]C[--

Another mistake.];B[ce];W[de];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[fe]C[--

White should cut first.];B[eg];W[ff];B[bg]TR[jc][mc]C[Black has a large corner, has moved out and... if he decides to protect the B7 stones maybe he can even attack the white group below later?

Two large safe corners, and two more corners that might become my territory later.

I liked the wholeboard situation.

My biggest problem is the two stones from earlier, but... only one weak group can't be bad or can it?

How to move them, what to do with them?

--

Sacrifice them perhaps, they are a liability at this point.  If you can make it very difficult but possible to kill them, while gaining strength towards the center and right side, it should be enough to win.]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[qk];B[qi]C[White threatend by base by moving on the third line, so I decided to attack while extending.

--

First I would play Q17 which threatens to connect to the weaker group.  White must answer this.

Then you could play O14 and play moves in the center that threaten to connect to the top group.  The idea is to build strength in the center, while trying to get white to waste a lot of moves just to kill the top group.  Then you can attack R9, and the groups around E7 and K5 both have weaknesses as well.

If you can get something for the two stones on top, it might be a better idea than trying to save them without having a clear plan for the rest of the board.]
;W[qn]
(;B[qo];W[pn];B[je]C[I really wanted to move this group out!]
;W[kd]C[How to answer this white move? I always get a horrible result... : - )

--

M15 might be interesting here, the idea being to connect to something in the center, rather than trying to save everything.

Black does not need the top group to live in order to win, but the center is a mess and some solid connections would be a big help.  See variation.]
(;B[kc];W[ld];B[lc];W[me];B[jd]C[--

How about H15 instead here?]
(;W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[re];W[pd]C[I wanted to ignore this move... but the price would've been too high.

--

K13 might be possible here; instead of ignoring it, try to address it in a way that also helps the top.  But Q15 is big enough that you were probably right to play it.]
;B[pe];W[bl]C[As mentioned earlier, I had already made my mind about giving up the B7 stones, so I like this possibility of gaining sente.]
;B[oj]C[Should I have protected bottom right corner instead, or should I have jumped out with K15 group instead?

--

I would try K7, then maybe L3 also, and then K13.  O10 seems not hugely important at this time since the Q15 stone makes this group easily alive.]
;W[op]
(;B[po]C[--

Oh, my.];W[oo];B[on]C[In a book or two, I have come across this empty triangle followed by the the cut, but... this is where I got utterly crushed.

In the books position is either "good for black" or "unreasonable for white" etc...

I have been searching for the tesuji to compare it with the game result, but haven't found it yet.

Probably it's closer to the corner or... N3 / P10 stones should be closer.

In any case, this is an utter failure by black.

EDIT: Found the problem I was referring to, see it in the variation-tree

--

Yes, this looks really bad.]

C[This is where I resigned, I answered L7 too hastily before realizing the threat of H7.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

I hope you can point out my biggest weaknesses, or where I'm good at and such.

Based on that, would be nice to know what to concentrate on, I have been studying joseki/tesuji/L&D problems daily.

--

You did very well up until these last two big mistakes.  So perhaps the biggest improvement you can make is in consistency, and when you do make a mistake, don't panic, but very carefully evaluate the board again, since the entire situation has changed.  Once something shifts like that, different groups become strong and weak and that's why it's very easy to follow one mistake with another, which is often impossible to recover from.

Also in the case of L7, this is a move made possible by the bad shape of the group at J6 with only two liberties.  When possible, avoid bad shape, such as by playing K6 at the point much earlier in the game where I mentioned it.  Especially in a faster game, the cost of bad shape is often that it leads to a major mistake later on.  This was a spectular example because you were doing so well up until the last few moves.

One final remark is to always keep track of how many points ahead or behind you think you might be, and when you are ahead, try to play more safely.  Don't try risky ideas like the empty triangle followed by cut when you can win by a safer and more secure path.

I enjoyed reviewing this very lively game, and your interesting questions.  Thanks!]
