C[Dear reviewer, thanks for having a look at this game.

I think the game started well. The upper right corner looked good.

But something must have been horrible wrong there. We (my opponent and me) had a look at this
corner after the game and found some worse solutions, but no better one.

I'll add some comments on my moves... the breaking point seems to be near move 105.


Hi,

My name is Micha Pringle. I am Tobamf on KGS. Unfortunately, I am rusty as I hardly play anymore and probably cannot review any higher than the 10k level. Although I have 20 books on Go, it's still likely that a lot of my suggestions/advice are going to be erroneous (i.e. probably make a 7d cringe). So take it all with a grain of salt, and if you have the time, explore some of my suggestions and see if you can come up with something better.]

SQ[qb][cc][dc][fc][gc][qc][qe][qf]C[The opening here suggests to me that black is emphasizing the sides, and white is emphasizing the side and also the middle. I'd love to comment on the direction of play and how the stones work together, but frankly I suck at that. 

The point to keep in mind here, is the idea behind the moves. D5 is a move that emphasizes the middle, so whites game, at least on that side should be directed at gaining influence towards the centre. If white does not follow this idea, his overall game will suffer (books never specify how much it will suffer though). So if you play a move that focuses on the side, that should be your idea to follow through on, if it's a move that's more in the middle, then focus on influence.]
;B[de];W[pj];B[dj];W[jd]C[white definitely seems to be going for a central strategy.

notice that blacks stones are on the 4th line (the D line) and these emphasize the centre as well.

Just as a general note, 3rd line territory (where your stones are on the 3rd line from the side) is considered to be reasonable. If you can get 4th line or more, then it is generally considered an excellent result. Conversely, second line sucks.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[dp];B[co];W[jo]C[well, white is following through with his strategy, keeping it all centrally oriented. K5 seems a bit high to me, but my fuseki/early chuban (middle game) stinks too.]
;B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[em]C[4th line for black. Yummy.

White is getting thick though. In the hands of a pro, this goes a long way. In our hands, well, we keep practicing don't we?]

;W[fo];B[gn];W[hm]C[i' m not clear what the previous comments meant/were asking, but notice that from the exchange that just took place, white and black are both stronger, i.e. more solid. This solidification will make it more difficult for black to launch an invasion later.]

Notice that while the white group broke out, 2 things happened.

1. Black got thick (see squares) and made a whole ton of points on the side.
2. white drove blacks stones (see triangles) into the moyo he was forming.]

(;B[mj]C[this is probably not a great move. White will be able to strengthen here, making his moyo all the more solid. Black would be better off to invade instead at Q5 (as an example point). See the variation.]

There really isnt one, in the same way there is no starting point in your massive left side. Keep this in mind as I will point out something at the end.]

So the major problem here is picking a time and place to invade. Typically, once all the large, easy to take moves are gone, its a good time to think about invading. If you leave it too late, well, you die, or stuggle along so weakly that your opponent makes a ton of points chasing you. Too early and you might be taking a spot offers a target to an opponent giving him some big moves early on. The biggest part of invading, in my experience, is in deciding when and where to invade.

If black had invaded earlier around R5, then the score would have been much different.

I hope this helps. Feel free to seek a second (and third) opinion.]
