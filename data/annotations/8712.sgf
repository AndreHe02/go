C[Hi.
I will do my best to answer your questions and to review the game.
---
Dear reviewer,

I added some questions and thoughts. I would appreciate your comments, especially on opening and middle game fighting.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[fq];B[mq]LB[po:A]C[N2 looks like it is not the best move. F3 makes the lower side uninteresting compared to the more open left or upper side. That said, we should not exaggerate it's badness. At least at our level I do not think it means that much.

Now after this A would be a terrible move for either player. 

There is a kind of fundamental principle in go, that you want to play in the area with the fewest stones. So you do not want to play close to thickness and you where the board is empty-

From that perspective, A is among the worst possible moves, because it would be played exactly in the least empty area of the board.
The move played in the game is much better, because it is played on the wide and open upper side.

---

Locally 'A' is better I guess.
I was thinking about approaching at 'A' immediatly.
On the other hand, if Black would play 'A' now, N3 looks to close and overconcentrated.
So I decided to play somewhere else.];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cf]
;W[fc]LB[ch:A][ci:B]C[Pincering may be better, as a pincer would work well with the lower left corner. A pincer also makes sense when considering again the principle that we should play in the most open area of the board. The left side is clearly bigger than the upper side, and so we would naturally feel like playing there.. 

---

I don't know, if it is better to pincer at 'A' or 'B' instead?]
;B[bd];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh];W[bf];B[ce];W[ci]
(;B[be]C[This is a mistake. Black should take the corner instead.]
;W[cc]C[I agree about this move and the reason for it. 

---

Usually Black takes the corner, so I thought it cannot be bad to take it myself.]
;B[bg];W[cl]TR[df]C[Black makes small life while White get to play on both sides. Furthermore, B still has to worry about the aji of the cut at A. 
White now has the advantage.

---

Black is safe now, but I got the top left corner plus an extension for my bottom left corner enclosure. So I was quite satisfied.]
(;B[cm]LB[hc:A][lc:B][df:C][ef:D]C[Black plays another strange move. If black wishes to invade it would make more sense to invade at A or B, where he has some kind of support.

But black also has the cut at C  which makes any invasion dangerous. Black probably has to play a move like D before he can do anything else. It feels like a slow move, but I believe the cut is too serious to ignore.

In any case, the objective of C7 is hard to understand. It does not really threathen anything, and it's is a small area where white would not play anyway.

---

Felt like an overplay to me.];W[dl];B[cp];W[cq];B[dq]C[White can play pretty much anything here, as long as it makes some kind of sense it will turn out well. It is hard to see where Black is going with this. 

---
Here it was pretty difficult for me to decide, which is the right move.]
;W[ep];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[co];B[bp];W[dr];B[bo];W[cn];B[bs]
;W[bn];B[ao]LB[df:A]TR[mq][pq]C[Black got about four points in the corner, white got big happiness. At least black managed to turn n3 into a good move, as his two stones are now in the right place to reduce the effectiveness of the White thickness. 

White may want to consider cutting at A now. 

---

Corner is gone, but I got tremendous thickness on both sides and sente.]
(;W[kq]LB[kp:A]C[I prefer L3 to A. But it is a kind of marginal question in my opinion. The important question is wether it is a good idea to extend in the first place.
Approaching a solid position like this is often not good. It doesn't put any pressure at all on the black stones.

---

Here I was unsure, if 'A' might be a better extension?

Till this point of the game I think I'm ahead. But in the upcoming fight, something went wrong obviously.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[ej];W[cj];B[hc]TR[df]C[Black invades, but the aji of the cut still lingers.]
;W[gd];B[lc]C[Black is playing more fancy moves that are very difficult to understand.]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[kc];B[kd];W[jc];B[md];W[lb];B[mb];W[ka];B[mc]
(;W[nb]C[This looks like a bad move, as it will just give away points. Also, white should still cut in sente.]
;B[ma];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qb];W[rb];B[pb];W[rf];B[qe];W[re]
;B[ra];W[qh];B[rc];W[rd];B[sb];W[oh]TR[ma][nb]C[The marked exchange, if white can not somehow make use for it, represents a clear gain for black. A single white stone would also leave some aji. and the endgame would be better.  

Also, the White group is not yet clearly alive, and it is not unlikely that black will benefit from attacking it. 

---
This again seemed like a success to me. The Black group seems quite overconcentrated and there is some aji left with the two white stones.]
;B[pi];W[ph];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo]
(;W[ir]LB[ko:A]C[This is often the natural shape, but in this case white has huge thickness that he wants to make use of. A two space extension on the second line is not the way to make use of a wall, so we should try to think of an alternative strategy. Pushing at A comes to mind.]
(;B[jq]LB[ko:A]C[This pusch does not seem like a good move. Instead, black should probably play at A to remove the danger that B wil be seperated.
Also, white should consider playing a now instead of responding.]
(;W[jr]LB[ko:A]C[Black should still play A and make W thickness ineffective]
;B[lr]C[Strange peep. White does not have to connect, so it is still possible to seperate and attack B.]
;W[ko];B[jn]
(;W[kr]C[White could still keep pushing.];B[kn];W[mo];B[pn]
;W[ln];B[jl];W[ll];B[hm]TR[df]C[White's thickness is almost worthless now , and the aji of the marked cut is much less serious.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[qm];B[qn];W[pm];B[om];W[rn];B[pl];W[qo];B[rm]
;W[oo];B[np];W[no]C[It does not feel like white has really gained anything from the sequense starting at r4, and Black now has sente. 
There is litte left of white's early advantage. If anything, the game is starting to look more promising for black.]
;B[hq]LB[hr:A]C[Most likely Black expects White to defend feebly at A, but that will of course not happen.]
;W[iq];B[fl];W[bh];B[af];W[bc]LB[df:B][gg:A]TR[fl]C[A would be a rather vague and abstract move. Then I prefer B17, which has a clear purpose and is easy to understand. 
White takes a big corner while also making B next sente. Black might have been better off, had he played b17 instead of the keima before.

---

This would probably the time to jump to 'A' or something in that area.]
;B[hf];W[hd];B[ac]TR[hf]C[It looks perhaps like marked move is now protecting against the cut, but this is not quite correct.]
(;W[ff];B[bb];W[cb];B[fg]
(;W[ba]LB[ad:A]C[This is being too kind to black. The cut remains, so White should at least take two stones by throwing in at A.
White can also tenuki and save the aji for later, but there is no reason to play this move instead of A.]
;B[ef]C[Black finally protects, though by now the cut is much less serious a threath than it was during a large part of the game.
Still, some aji remains, so it is not an useless move.];W[gf]
;B[gg];W[ig]C[I do not understand what this move is.];B[if]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[hg];W[kf]LB[mh:A]C[That way white will be able to link up.

[jr:84][kr:88][lr:85][bs:39]C[A, like most other moves, would have been better. But white is far behind at this point so it really does not matter. The review ends here.


Summary:

White played well early in the game. Black made a serie of mistakes beginning with 21 and the sequence starting at 25, that taken together White seemed to have a comfortable game. Both players made the mistake by ignoring the cut at B throughout the game. 

After 41, White had gained thickness, and had sente to use it. The thickness was never really utilized however, perhaps most important reason that white lost. White had an advantage but never used it.

Starting with 62, White created a weak group which would turn into a serious problem later, as White was forced to defend with 134 instead of connecting at 135.

Perhaps the point where things really took a turn for the worse started with White playing the submissive move of 82, seriously compromising the effectiveness of W thickness. Instead of using the strenght to attack, W decided to get about 10 points on the edge, which makes Black's four points-corner look like a good deal, considering the amount of stones played in the area by both sides.

When white lost sente after an invasion which at best gained nothing, starting with 96, it feels like white is falling behind. The game is over when white dies in the center, but even before that things had not been going white's wayt for a while

Most important point:

You played well in the opening but lost in the middle game, gaining a significant advantage but never knowing what to do with it.

Most crucial to this game is not using thickness properly. Not exploitng the weakness at B, playing the weak move at 82 and just generally not using the thickness for anything much. The fact that you managed to die right next to it is really something. So my main advice is that you should try to train in using thickness. For example, play openings with 4-4 or 5-4 in the opening and try to focus on getting thickness instead of taking points. That is something that I found useful at least.

That is all I have to say. I hope this review was of use for you. Good luck

Also the two marked stones are weak, and are likely to be captured by a move around A, which would be a huge gain for white.

Attacking to gain elsewhere is the basic principle of using thickness, though it is not simple to do in practise. Of course, we can not say for sure that black would play like this in the actual game. But with the very nice white thickness to the left, and black only having one direction in which he can escape, it is most likely that the result would be something like this.]
