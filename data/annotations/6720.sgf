C[Hello, dear reviewer! In this game I played black and won it only bu 0,5 pts. My main problem, I think, was making not enough cash from attackhing W weak groups. I have added some questions during the game, but will be happy to any other suggestions and general comments about the game!
Thank you in advice for help!
Good luck!
Igor' (FR)

[ZD\] Hi; I will mark my comments this way.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[nc];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]TR[qj][cn]C[FR: In the game I played C6 kakari. Was it better to complete moyo and defend right corner weakness, playing around R10?]

(;B[cn];W[ck]LB[ck:A]C[[ZD\] A is unusual; other pincers are considered to be slightly better.]
;B[bp]LB[dp:B][cq:A]C[[ZD\] However, this answer seems to be a mistake -- you lose a chance to invade at A, or to attack B later, and your group does not become much stronger.  It is not necessary to play here to separate black, either.]
;W[cq];B[en];W[gq]LB[fp:A]C[[ZD\] for white, I would think about A, to continue attacking.]
;B[fc]LB[di:C][ck:A][ek:B]C[[ZD\] Given that A is far, this is playable, but still, exchanging B for C to strenghten your group might be better.]
;W[df];B[id];W[ec];B[fd];W[ql]LB[ek:A]C[[ZD\] Now A would be a good point for white.]
;B[qj];W[rn];B[np]C[[ZD\] This move looks weird -- you will get an overconcentrated group, and strenghten white.]

(;W[mq];B[oq];W[rp]
(;B[qq];W[pj];B[qi];W[dh];B[rq];W[eb];B[qm];W[rm]
(;B[rk]C[[ZD\] This is overplay, you cannot close white in anymore.]

(;W[rl]C[[ZD\] But white makes a mistake, so the sequence works again.]
;B[pl];W[qk]
(;B[rj];W[pk]C[[ZD\] Letting white out like this seems wrong.]

(;B[ol];W[qn]C[[ZD\] Answering this seems unnecessary.]
(;B[pm]
(;W[qo];B[so];W[sp];B[pi];W[nj]
(;B[oi];W[nk];B[ni];W[of];B[qf]LB[mf:B][of:A]C[FR: Now I think, that R14 was to passive :(
Was it better to cap P14 with N14?

[ZD\] Yes; A is a bit deep, B looks like a correct answer.]
;W[pd];B[pc];W[qc];B[pe];W[od]
(;B[qb];W[oc];B[rc]
(;W[oe];B[ob]C[[ZD\] A mistake from white, now his group is heavy.]
;W[md];B[mc];W[mf];B[li]LB[li:A][qi:B]C[FR: Was M16 better?

[ZD\] I think so; A is not necessary to prevent connection, and since B is connected, it is not necessary to strenghten the group, either.]
;W[kd];B[lc];W[ld];B[kc];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[nn];W[jd];B[ic]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[ha];B[ga];W[gb];B[hb];W[ia];B[ib];W[fa]C[FR: Is there still any chance to kill W ot to attack him further? (L14 for example)

[ZD\] L14 does not work.  K14 closes white in, giving you thickness necessary to invade left side.]

;B[le];W[ng];B[bq];W[br]
(;B[bl]C[[ZD\] This is aji-keshi, making it harder to invade left side.]
;W[bk];B[cl];W[dk];B[mn];W[lm];B[ln];W[lj];B[mi];W[lk];B[km]
;W[kl];B[kq]C[[ZD\] Good point.];W[kp];B[lq];W[lp];B[mp];W[mr]

(;W[jr];B[kn];W[jk]
(;B[ce]LB[bk:B][bl:A]C[FR: W left side seemed too big :( But I wasn't sure about right way to invade it... Was there something better, then C15?

[ZD\] I think it is too late to invade left, after the A-B exchange.]

(;W[cf]C[[ZD\] This answer looks a bit risky, but might work as well.]
;B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ee];B[ed];W[dc];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[ge]
;B[gf];W[be];B[he];W[gd];B[gc];W[bd]C[[ZD\] Yes, it was too late to invade there :-(]
;B[hd]C[FR: Now I have wall around F14, so it would be difficult for W to make some territory in the center. But still I'm not sure about result of C15 invasion.

[ZD\] Since there was not any danger that white could make a territory there, this does not seem to be a gain.]
