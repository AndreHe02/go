;W[ne];B[ng];W[jd]C[Li: o9 (node9) is very good];B[jp];W[po];B[np];W[qq]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[rr];W[rk]
(;B[rl]C[Li: s9 itself is not good, but b missed the chance. r9, s10, r7 are all
possible. Variations are a lot (see some enclosed). I don't know what is the

best move here, but I prefer r7 because that is where w should play. The point is
that B should get better result.];W[ql];B[qk];W[rm];B[rj];W[sl];B[fq];W

[rq]
(;B[ko]C[Li: s3 is too bad. But l5 is too kind, m6 could determine the game, seeing var.
for some common moves.];W[jq];B[ir];W[mn]C[oba: I had not seen the W followup at n6 which lets W escape. But even then j2 might be correct
 because B is happy to chase W after W n6.   Li: agree.];B[nn];W[ln];B[jm]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[kl];B[jl];W[mj];B[jj];W[mh];B[mg];W[kh];B[li];W[ki]C[oba: B m11 weakens k10 for little benefit, so I should probably have played directly around d6.   But I was very short on time so the next 15 moves were played on instinct very quickly.
 Li: yes, m11 too bad, should d6 or c6];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[mk];W
[ll];B[dn];W[er];B[eo];W[fr];B[cf];W[dj]C[Li: maybe d11 is better, if w c14, you can invade upper side]

(;B[cg]C[Li: connection at c13 seems not good, because it creates two separate weak groups.

u can think about exchange as shown in Var. B takes the corner in sente and has no weak
 groups, can chose q18 or m12];W[ef];B[di];W[cj];B[fj];W[fk];B[ej];W[gl]

;B[ge];W[be];B[pb];W[lh];B[mi];W[ni]C[oba: B n11 should have been directly at o9, but again I was extremely short on time.]
;B[nk]C[Li: Have you thought about giving up these 4 stones? They are not so important
. how about r11 or e18 then j17 etc?];W[nh];B[ph];W[ri];B[sj]C[oba: B t10 doesn't work but I was so short on time that I played it immediately without thinking.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[qi];B[rh];W[si];B[sh];W[qj];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq]C[B loses on time


oba: B had to defend against w o8 and the f16 group is not yet settled, so W may have won anyway.


Li: Both have good and bad moves. It seems to me that you are better than your opponent in the global  sense, but you should improve your fighting ability.]
