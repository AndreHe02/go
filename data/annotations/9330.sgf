C[Hello dear reviewer.
I picked this game since I had hard  time picking moves in this match and I would like to hear the opinion of the stonger player.

[kb\]: Hello,
I think you should have spent more time reviewing the game yourself for submission.  It would have been more instructive for you to try out some variations first.

You have made several serious middle game errors in this game.  Please study it closely so you can try to open your mind to new possibilities.  I hope it can help your game!]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[ed];B[ec]C[I decided to defend the corner with sente and take the empty corner]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf];W[jd];B[dp];W[nc];B[qf];W[fq]
(;B[cn]C[[kb\]: Wrong direction - bottom side is more open and has more potential .  H3 and J4 are good moves here.]

(;W[jp]LB[hq:A][lc:B]C[[kb\]: This White play is a little loose.  There are two invasion points, so as White I would choose D2 instead.]
;B[qn];W[pk]
(;B[on]C[Too passive?

[kb\]: I think going into the corner or a double approach is acceptable.  This move is probably also OK, but seems a little closed-minded.  See variation.]
;W[np]
(;B[rp];W[qq];B[rk]TR[qf]C[[kb\]: I do not like the combination of the marked stones.  White can safely treat Q9 as light, and continue to expand either framework.]
;W[fo]C[[kb\]: Black gives White the opportunity to play this move.]

(;B[lq]C[Later I thought about playing m4(inviding on the same line as the opponent stones are placed?)

[kb\]: This move is played way too early.  How about playing M17 instead?]
;W[jq]C[[kb\]: Wow, what a poor White move.];B[lo];W[nn];B[om]
;W[nm];B[lm];W[nl];B[jn]TR[jq]C[[kb\]: Black gains great shape within White's framework.  K3 allowed this.]
;W[jl]C[[kb\]: This doesn't work.];B[lk];W[rq]
(;B[qp]C[Bad move?

[kb\]: This move is very slow.  See variation.];W[po];B[qm]
TR[rp]C[[kb\]: These moves only get a few points for Black, but White gains a lot from blocking in the corner.  It's better to play more actively.]
;W[li]C[[kb\]: Looks like an overplay.  The wedge still works.]
;B[il]C[[kb\]: Just separate!];W[ik];B[im];W[hk]TR[il][im][ik]
C[[kb\]: This exchange is better for White.];B[kr];W[jr];B[oo]
;W[mq];B[no];W[lp];B[kp];W[mp];B[ko];W[kq]
(;B[mj]C[The trade seems to be bad for black side and reviewing the game later I thought n10 is a bit slow

[kb\]: N10 is slow, but the right direction.  How about N11?]
;W[pg]C[[kb\]: This looks like a good move for White, but it feels like an overplay.]

(;B[qg]C[[kb\]: Very slack.  See variation.];W[ph];B[nh];W[ng]
;B[mg]C[[kb\]: In this case, extending straight to N12 is better, since it doesn't help your opponent and preserves the connection without creating a weakness you have to fix anyway.]
;W[nf];B[ok]C[[kb\]: Small - you should continue chasing these stones.]
;W[mh]C[[kb\]: Ouch, White gains 20 points.];B[oi];W[lg]C[[kb\]: This is terrible for Black.  What was Black's influence before is now all White's, and the invasion at top is all but gone.]
;B[jj];W[jk]C[[kb\]: Small.  White should tenuki.];B[oc];W[nd]
;B[kj];W[qh];B[jg];W[jh];B[ih];W[ii];B[hg];W[hh];B[ig];W[ji]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[hd]C[[kb\]: Premature; you're giving up an invasion opportunity.  First secure your central group with G13, then invade later.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[je];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[fg]C[I felt I reduced white on top but I ended up with aji]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[Best answer?];W[ob];B[pb];W[pc];B[qb];W[od];B[rc]
;W[ie]LB[dk:B][dr:A]C[Maybe I should have tenuki here?

[kb\]: Yes, B is a good move.

The rest of the moves are uninteresting.  I hope this review has helped you think about how to improve your middle game.]
