C[Hi, Matt! I'm Igor', currently around 5k on KGS (Felisratus) and I'll do my best to review your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them!
See also final comments.];B[dd];W[cq]C[Rare move.];B[qd];W[pq]
;B[oc];W[cf];B[fd];W[qo];B[qj];W[jp];B[nq]LB[jc:B][cj:C][oj:A]
C[This is a gready move for B. It would be better for him to expand his moyo at A or B or to attack C14 stone (C)]

(;W[lq]C[Good response for W, but look also at some variations at move 11]
;B[no]
(;W[ci]C[Good solid move :)];B[co];W[ep];B[cl]LB[cc:B][bd:A]
TR[jc]C[If you want to strengthen your C14 group, it would be better to exchange A for B, but playing this way you erase aji of invading san-san later (see variations). 

But even if B plays B16 first, W can live easily playing B9. So you can see, W group is safe now and there is no need to play in the upper-left corner immediately. It would be much better for W to play around K17 (your opponent's good move is your good move too)]

(;W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[de];B[ed]
(;W[ff]LB[jc:A][qh:B][ql:C]C[This is the bad move for W: it doesn't make territory, it doesn't  protect your weak stones (C14 group isn't a weak one), it doesn't  attack opponents weak stones. This move is gote. This  move gives B a chance to take any "extra" big point on the board "for free". It is like giving your opponent a handicap stone during the game.  Try to avoid such moves in your games and you will become 2 stones stronger ;) 
Now B can take any big point on the board (K17 or P10 for example) and fuseki will be favorable for him. W should play A, B or C (see variations at move 23) instead of F14 in this position]
;B[jc]TR[oc][qd][qj]SQ[cl][co][no][nq]C[Now B is ahead. His territory on the upper side is roughly equal to W bottom and low-right (but keep in mind, that invasion around G3 is still possible), but B has great center moyo (marked with triangles "two-wing" formation) to expand. Now W should launch a very effective atack against B weak groups (marked with squares) to win...]

(;W[en]C[Good but kind passive. Better to put it on the D6 or D7]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[bq]
(;W[br]C[W can safely play B4 (see var.)];B[bp];W[el]LB[oe:A]
[qh:B]C[If you want to expand W moyo, it will be better to play K6, but it will be slow (around 8-12 extra points for W). Now it's much more urgent to reduce B potential centre moyo (A or B for W). If B manages to play P10, the game will be very hard for W]
;B[eo]LB[je:C][oj:A][qm:B]C[Black moves 33-37 are a kind of "thank-you moves" - they give nothing to B, while helping W to build the solid wall.  B left group is safe now, so instead of E5, he must take any big point (A-C)]
;W[fo]
(;B[do];W[fq];B[dn];W[em];B[dl];W[ej]C[There is no need to connect two strong alive groups. Instead of E10 W  MUST reduce B moyo now]
;B[cj];W[di];B[dj]
(;W[fi]TR[oe][qh][pi]C[Now B lower-left group is super overconcentrated and W has the extrasolid wall which will be very useful in reducing B moyo ))) Moves from 33 to 43 were very bad for B. But F11 is slow for W - there is no need to defend this cutting point now (see var.). Now it is the best time to play P15, Q11 or R12 to reduce B moyo!]

Try to consider the  whole board position and make not just good local moves, but the best moves on the board. It will be very usefull for you to read Otake Hideo book "Opening Theory Made Easy" and, of course, solve as much life and death problems, as you can. Good luck in improving your Go!
