eboshi1 [3k\]: hi


Hello, and thanks in advance for the review!];B[qd];W[dp];B[cd]
;W[qp];B[id]C[I'm not really sure if this is a good way to go or not, I think I thought I had Q16.

Kirsten: might not be a catalogized opening, but this cannot really make the difference in an amateurs' game I guess]
;W[fc];B[ed]C[Trading the corner for influence.];W[fd];B[fe]
;W[ib];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[kc];W[ge];B[ff];W[hd]C[I was ok with this turnout, since I felt I gained good influence on the left and the right side of the top, while white lives small (with potential access to the corner).  Any further movement towards the middle would be easily contained so I move on.]
;B[op]C[Kirsten: my instinct tells me the left side is  more importtant.]
(;W[qm];B[lq]C[Would M4 be better here?  I guess I thought I would be safer this way.

Kirsten: I think both are ok. Or R3.];W[nq]C[Kirsten: You have to decide what you want: fighting wit P3 or trade territory for influence with O4. I would play P3 with R7 in place.]
(;B[np];W[mq]
(;B[lp];W[mp];B[mo]C[Kirsten: this doesn't look good.];W[oq]
(;B[fq]C[Is this too far of a jump from my strength?  I wanted to use it to attack the corner.

Kirsten: Well, there is no strength with all those cuts...]
(;W[hq]
(;B[hp]C[Kirsten: I would not attack this hard];W[ip];B[gp]
;W[jq];B[jo]C[Kirsten: Your groups don't work together. Attacking with one weakons the other.]
;W[io];B[in]
(;W[ho];B[fn]C[Again, I feel ok with this since I did in fact gain more power to attack the corner and control the left, as well as good general influence for the center.  Was it worth giving up so much of the bottom though?

Kirsten: First, I think W's move at H5 is too friendly, because he ends in gote. But the result here looks ok for you.]
(;W[hn];B[im];W[hm];B[dn]C[Kirsten: good. Attacks D4 and also works together with the upper left.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[ck]
;W[jl];B[km];W[jm];B[jn];W[il];B[kl];W[kk]
(;B[lk];W[kj];B[hf]C[I'm not entirely sure why I did this.  I might've forgotten that both groups were alive...]
;W[gf]
(;B[hg]C[Kirsten: this is the wrong side. Influence against the right is worthless, as W stands inside with L10. Defend Your moyo.]
;W[gg];B[om]
(;W[pp];B[nn];W[ll];B[lm];W[ml]C[This is where I started worrying for this groups life.  I feel that in general here I have bad shape, since there is so much aji all over to take away any eyespace I have...  Is that right?  I'm still trying to improve my ability to recognize good shape from bad shape.  Would there have been moves earlier on that would give me better shape?

Kirsten: see comment on move 59];B[mj];W[nk];B[ok];W[nj];B[mi]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[ko];B[lo]C[I think I did this for the sake of shape.  I felt that if I had connected there, it would've been a death over many moves, or just a big fat shape that's running to the corner to die.]
;W[kp];B[pi];W[ni]
(;B[nh]C[Kirsten: I see, that you do very often moves like that. Attacking very hard, but creating own weaknesses. I'm not saying this is bad. In this example, your group isn't alive yet, and you create new weaknesses in another group.]
;W[oj];B[pk];W[mh];B[mg]C[Was the hane at O12 a mistake, or was trying to make those three stones live a mistake period?  I gave up on it living here and instead tried to grab a huge corner.

Kirsten: see comments before.]
(;W[lj];B[lh]C[I was very happy for a ponnuki here to help with my influence.  Was this a mistake on white's part?

Kirsten: W is a very nice person :)
Sure, I see no problem with W M12.];W[mk];B[eh]C[I wasn't really sure what to do next, so I decided to try and prevent an invasion of the corner.  At this point in the game, I feel like I'm pretty far ahead with two large corners and lots of influence along the left and top, as well as points to attack white's corners.  I also feel that white has a lot of stones that serve no purpose and don't really gain territory.  is this the case?

Kirsten: Yes, getting this perfect ponnuki plus getting it in sente (!) puts you ahead very much. E12 is the best move here I think.]
;W[hh]
(;B[gh]C[Kirsten: why? what do you want to attack?];W[fh];B[fi]
;W[gi];B[fj];W[ie];B[jg];W[he];B[ih];W[ii];B[ji];W[ij]C[Kirsten: You are both playing endgame while the upper right corner still can get invaded...]
(;B[je]C[Stopping white's advance into the corner.  Are there bigger moves here?

Kirsten: still P17];W[jf];B[kg];W[ke];B[le]C[I was ok with sacrificing one stone.

Kirsten: OK, but why playing it then? this sacrifice didn't gain you anything. You could have played L15 instead.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[qi];B[qh]
(;W[qk]C[I almost forfeited in the next few moves.  I felt like an idiot and that this was more urgent than I imagined.  I guess I didn't forsee this sequence.

Kirsten: I didn't see it too. So of course this would be more important then than E12 or P17.]
;B[pn];W[oo];B[qn];W[pm];B[ql];W[ol];B[rk];W[rl];B[rm];W[pl]
;B[nl]C[I live... but barely.];W[no];B[mn];W[oh];B[og];W[ph]
(;B[ri];W[pg];B[of];W[pf];B[pe];W[kb];B[lc]C[I don't hane because I'm ok with the influence I gain, and I feel it's almost even because for every point white gets, i also secure one more point for myself.

Kirsten: You don't need any influence in the endgame, but not playing hane is still correct because it leaves no aji vor an invasion.]
;W[jd]
(;B[dq]C[Would there be a better way to attack this corner?]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[hr];W[ir];B[gq];W[kn]C[Should I have saved this?  I thought most of my moves since then have been more than the ~8 points I'd get.

Kirsten: You are right, there are bigger endgames. Still a W move on D18, N18 or B10 would cause much more damage.]
;B[kq];W[jp];B[ec];W[rf];B[re];W[rg];B[ep]C[B9 or M18 is bigger.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[bk];B[cj]C[Same idea as the upper right.  Are there better alternatives?

Kirsten: I guess not.];W[nc]C[Ok, this next sequence ends in a ko fight that I mess up.  Any advice on how I could've better responded to make better than ko would be much appreciated.  Also, I'll probably ask more later but any advice on the ko fight would be appreciated as well, since I'm fairly unexperienced with them and finding ko threats.]
;B[mb]C[Cut off escape.];W[oe]
(;B[od];W[ne];B[nd];W[mf];B[me];W[pc];B[oc];W[qc];B[rc];W[ob]
C[I didn't really see this yet.  I wanted to take out eyespace, but I kinda freaked out after this move.]
;B[qb];W[pb];B[nb]C[Reviewing this, would S18 be better here?  I think that would've prevented life.]
;W[rb];B[sb];W[qa];B[oa]C[Trying to take this eye space, P19 would've made life right?

Kirsten: still looks like Ko for me.];W[ah]C[Saw this coming and was ok with it, but I think I responded to it wrong.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[ch];W[cg];B[dg];W[ci];B[cf];W[bj];B[di];W[ig]
;B[jh];W[eb];B[db];W[fb];B[da]C[Too small?  I was thinking something with the M3 group to maybe stretch down and monkey jump into the corner like I do later.]
;W[ic];B[la];W[kr];B[lr];W[gr];B[iq];W[kf];B[lf];W[hq];B[fr]
C[I didn't really care for this ko fight.  As I mentioned before, I'm bad at them and I felt like it wasn't worth the effort.  Good thing I kept the ko threats for the one coming up...]
;W[hs];B[os]C[I think I played this wrong because it wound up with me dying in the corner.  I think I tried to get too much out of it.

Kirsten: correct. Just the normal sequence and you and in sente, that's great enough.]
;W[or];B[ns];W[ps];B[pr];W[ms];B[qs];W[mr];B[qq];W[rr]C[Dead.]

;B[jj];W[jk];B[qg];W[qf];B[qe];W[se]C[I think this is what made the corner a ko fight.  Should I have seen this coming?]
(;B[sd]C[Kirsten: With T16 it's easy to spot the Ko. But you could have played S16 instead.]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[oi];B[ea];W[fa];B[ka]C[Any advice on my end game would be appreciated, I think I have a hard time seeing bigger sente moves so I settle for little moves like this.]
;W[sf]C[I guess if I had captured that it would've saved me some trouble.

Kirsten: Sure,];B[fs];W[sa];B[ra];W[nm];B[on];W[sa];B[sp];W[ro]
;B[so];W[sn];B[rn];W[sq];B[ra]C[I never really understood how higher level players could play whole sequences out in a ko fight.  Did I do that right?

Kirsten: First, you lose Ko threats by doing so. I see no reason here to do so, the B group in the lower right has no other purposes than creating ko threats.]
;W[dc];B[qb]C[I thought the upper right was worth more than the upper left.  In retrospect, it looks more equal.  I think I had hoped to have my cake and eat it too.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[dd];W[cb];B[bd];W[rb];B[nf]C[I think I just gave up here.]
