C[Dear reviewer,

I play White in this game. From the start, I felt that Black had taken a lead. I would appreciate comments on some sequences and the whole game in general. Thank you very much.]

I didn't know how to respond to this move... I assumed that I could run and build up strength and then attack this stone... Wrong strategy?


I belive that your strategy is correct. There are other choices through, for example, you can play P17 and end up getting the corner and give black the outside. There was a game between changhao Lee and Changhao with asimilar opening , which you may try to find and refer to. Overall, this is a complex situation and I can not confidently suggest more.]
;W[nf]C[I think the direction is correct. But play W[O15\] is better. the prent move gives less pressure to B.]
;B[rb];W[qj];B[qh];W[od]C[I wanted to make good shape before embarking on the attack.


Correct, however, if you played at O15 eariler, you would not have to worry about the shape of this group. O14 is a thin shape due to a possible cut]
;B[oc];W[ne];B[md];W[oj]C[This a move I can not agree. I will play R6 to see how black respond. and latter play O12 to attack the two black stones. 

Unless you can play P11 to seal these two stones. Otherwise, attacking from this direction will gives more pressure on the upper white group.]
;B[nh]C[Now, the upper white group is in a worse postion then the three black stones. I like B better.]
;W[le];B[ld]LB[pk:A][pj:B][qm:C]C[For this move, I will  consider B[A\] , W[B\], B[C\] to attack W first. W has no time to play M16. Even W does, it would not affect much the upper black corner.]
;W[lg];B[mi];W[pn]C[After this move, I think W is not bad now. My feeling is that B[M16\] is slow.]
;B[np];W[qp];B[po];W[qo]C[This exchange loses territory vey much, W is happy]
;B[on];W[pm];B[pk];W[qk]C[This is bad move. Certainly, W could connect at W[Q11\], and black has no further effetive moves to cut white into two parts. This is a very serious mistake. Notice that the weak 4-stone black group is now not only settled, but forms a wall outside. which is a big loss for W.]
;B[pj];W[pq]LB[om:A][nn:B][ok:C]C[Was this too early? Should I have played O8 first...?


Yes, I think it is two early. I will play  W[A\], B[B\], A[C\],

That way White is still in an attacking position. Black needs to worry about the middle group, and is not possible to seal w and form a wall outside.]
;B[oq];W[pr];B[pl];W[ql];B[om]C[Black formed a perfect wall outside. It is very hard for w to win this game now. The potential of black moyo is huge, expecially when there is still one white group unsettled.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];B[ol];W[nj]C[White draging two stones out from here is quite over-played. There become two unsettled group for white.
The situation is very diffcult.];B[lh]LB[mj:A]C[B[A\] can easily capture the two white stones.]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[mk];B[jh];W[mg];B[mh];W[og];B[oh];W[kk]C[If W can destroy the potential of black moyo with little cost, then W can catch up with a lot.]
;B[ll];W[ml]LB[lk:A]C[W[A\] probably is the only move.];B[lk]
;W[lm];B[mj];W[kl];B[lj];W[oo];B[no]LB[op:A]C[black should play B[A\], and W can not escape.]
;W[op];B[mm];W[lp];B[ln];W[mr];B[nr]LB[ko:A]C[B should B[a\]]

;W[gq];B[er];W[gp];B[go];W[gs];B[fr];W[fo]C[I misread the following sequence. Did I end up strengthening Black?

I belive it is a consequence of previous moves way way back.]
;B[fn];W[ho];B[gn];W[ko];B[jn];W[lo];B[km];W[jo];B[io];W[in]
;B[hn];W[iq]LB[im:A]C[W should absolutely play W[A\], and should not tolerate B[a\] to take this stone away. Note that B[A\] is also a sento.]
;B[im]C[B is too thick outside. W has no chance afterwards.]
;W[ms]LB[di:A]C[This is unnecessary. W is alive already. W[A\] is better.]
;B[je];W[me];B[pd];W[oe];B[qe];W[qf];B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[rh]
;B[ch]LB[ck:A]C[Again, how do I respond to this move?


in an usual situation , you can play W[A\], but now it is not possible to W to win. So it is hard to say how to respond.]
;W[cj]LB[cl:A]C[This move gives Black a good invading point of A]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[bf];W[de];B[bd];W[bc];B[db];W[cd];B[be];W[cb]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[eh]LB[cl:A]C[now white again needs to make alive and also worry about the invadion of B[A\]. Since W can not win for sure. I have no further comments but a summary afterwards.]

This was a game where I can't really say where I made my biggest mistakes. I hope the reviewer can point them out. Once again, thank you very much, and I apologize for the excessive amount of questions I asked.


I marked the 6 biggest mistakes I can tell  using letters from A to F.  From the questions asked, I can tell that you are a pretty strong player.  You will certainly become stronger when you have a better understanding of the potential of thickness.]
