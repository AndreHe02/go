C[Hello!

My name is Kalle. I hope my review will be helpful for you and stimulate some interesting thoughts. I'll start my comments with "Kalle:"]
;B[pd];W[fq];B[qp];W[cf];B[oq]LB[cp:A]C[Kalle: You could also approach the white corner, at A for example, not to give him the shimari he's aiming for. A matter of taste I guess.]
;W[cp];B[pj];W[nc];B[pf];W[qh]C[Kalle: This white invasion seems way too early. You will build nice thickness while forcing white to live small on the side.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[pg];W[qi]
(;B[lc]LB[qj:A]TR[qp][oq]C[Kalle: I think it's very important not to tenuki yet from the right side. You have a shimari in the lower right corner and it is crying for you to block at A to maximize your territorial potential in that region :) The block also forces white to settle his stones on the side while you build more thickness (see variation).]
;W[pi]C[Kalle: White pushes immediately to create cutting points and settle his group.]
;B[oi];W[qj];B[pk];W[rl]C[Kalle: With this sequence white stabilized his group and erased some of your potential territory at the same time.]
;B[dc]C[Kalle: A good point];W[qc];B[pc]C[Kalle: This is the correct direction for the block.]
;W[re]LB[hd:B][de:A]C[Kalle: Now it's a good opportunity for black to tenuki and reinforce the upper side. You have a great wall facing the upper side, so you have to make the most of it now before white gets a chance to reduce it. Points like A and B seem interesting to me.]

(;B[rd]LB[qd:A]C[Kalle: This move is a little greedy. White can reply at A.]

(;W[qe];B[qd]C[Kalle: This is a big success for black.];W[pe]
;B[oe];W[qf]LB[od:A]C[Kalle: This move seems unnecessary for white. He's just helping you by forcing you to protect the cutting point.]

(;B[od]LB[nd:A]C[Kalle: I think this connection would be better at A.]
;W[fc]LB[ic:A][fd:C][de:B]C[Kalle: This is a very big point at this stage of the game. White has the upper hand now. Preventing this move at an earlier stage would have been very important. 

Answering this move is difficult, because you would like to use you thickness on the right, but not give up everything on the left either. It's hard to say what's best here.

Just playing at A is possible. The corner stone still has room to move, so it's not dead. You can treat it lightly and see what white does.

It might also be possible to move out with B. The continuation from there looks quite good to me, maybe this is the right choice.

Your play at C is natural, but it strengthens white and gives him an easy way to answer.]

(;B[fd]C[Kalle: The problem with this move is that it forces white to strengthen himself on the upper side, making it difficult for you to use your wall effectively. You should try to keep white weak and aim for attacking him either on the upper side or the left side.]
;W[gc]
(;B[ck]LB[ed:A]C[Kalle: This is a big point, but the problem is that this leaves white the opportunity to settle his shape in the upper left corner, which harms your prospects on the upper side. White can play for example A.

Maybe it's better to continue on the upper side a little bit and settle the shape. Black can play at A now instead of this.]

(;W[ci];B[cn];W[eo]LB[ej:A]C[Kalle: This move tries to attack, but it doesn't have very much influence on black. I think A is the right direction.]

(;B[ek]LB[ej:B][dl:A]C[Kalle: It seems to me that you can't get a good result after white plays at A. Maybe it's better to play at B instead (see variation).]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dk]LB[dj:A]C[Kalle: My first instinct is to resist at A but it doesn't work that well (see variation).]

(;B[cj];W[dj];B[bi];W[ch];B[dm];W[em];B[en];W[fn];B[dn];W[fm]
;B[cd]C[Kalle: Very big point];W[jc];B[ke];W[je]
(;B[kf]LB[jf:A]C[Kalle: I think you should push more and play at A instead, to use your wall more.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[kq];B[dp]LB[bp:A]C[Kalle: This is a bit optimistic :) Maybe you should start with A or just wait and see what the appropriate approach here is.]
;W[do];B[co];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr]
(;B[iq]LB[jp:A]C[Kalle: This invasion is too deep and very dangerous. Just reducing with A is enough.]
;W[jo];B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[hn];B[jn];W[ko];B[fo];W[ep];B[fp]
;W[eq];B[kr];W[lr];B[jq];W[lq];B[gr];W[jr];B[ir];W[ks];B[gq]
;W[hp];B[go];W[gn]LB[hq:A][fr:B]C[Kalle: You fought well, but there's just too little space for living. Playing at A won't help you live, because white can answer at B (see the variation)]

(;B[el];W[hq]C[Kalle: This is actually unnecessary. The black group is dead.]

(;B[di]TR[em][fm][fn][gn][hn][in]C[Kalle: Here you could think about playing atari from the other side and aiming to threaten the marked white stones below. This way you might be able to create a big center still (see variation).]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[fj];B[eg];W[bh];B[aj];W[be];B[bd];W[dg];B[fi]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[fg];B[eh];W[gi];B[gg];W[ed];B[ee];W[dh];B[df]
;W[bg];B[jf];W[fr]LB[gj:A][gk:B]C[Kalle: Here you have a chance to play the ataris at A and B and take the center. You can still attack the top later, if white doesn't protect (see variation).]

(;B[jd]LB[kc:A]TR[je]C[Kalle: This move is actually helping white, because he gets to play A next and by sacrificing the marked stone he can play some forcing moves.]
;W[kc]LB[lb:A]TR[jd]C[Kalle: Now blocking at A is best, even if it means sacrificing the marked stone.]

(;B[id];W[lb];B[ic];W[ib];B[ld];W[hb];B[mb];W[ka]LB[nb:A]C[Kalle: You can play in the center now, but white has the play at A, if you don't defend.]
;B[ja];W[jb];B[ma];W[eb];B[db];W[ec];B[ce];W[af]LB[la:A]TR[ma]
C[Kalle: Here is again a good opportunity to take the center, and after playing the marked stone your corner territory is safe. You should abstain from playing at A, because it's gote.]
;B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[he];B[ie];W[hf]C[Kalle: Forcing white to push through like this harms your prospects in the center.]
;B[ga];W[fb];B[la]C[Kalle: ?];W[kb]C[Kalle: Now you have to connect and you lose sente at a critical moment.]
;B[mc];W[kj]LB[gj:A]C[Kalle: Playing in the center was your priviledge, but white gets there first, which is a big loss. You can still play the ataris starting at A though, so he shouldn't get much territory either.]
;B[li];W[lj];B[mj];W[ki];B[kh];W[lh];B[mi];W[jh];B[kg];W[gh]
C[Kalle: It's a pity that white gets to play this move first.]
;B[lm]C[Kalle: Reducing the center is the right thing to do, but at this stage it has become very difficult.]
;W[mm]
(;B[ml];W[ll];B[mn];W[nm];B[kl];W[lk]
(;B[ln]LB[kn:A]C[Kalle: Maybe it's possible to connect at A instead, to get further inside the white territory.]
;W[nn];B[mp];W[no];B[lp];W[kp];B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[kn]LB[gj:B][il:A]C[Kalle: I recommend playing at A instead. Before that you should force the ataris from B.]
;W[nr];B[op];W[pr];B[or];W[qn];B[ns];W[ms];B[os];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[ro];B[po];W[pn];B[sq];W[jk];B[il]TR[jk]C[Kalle: After the marked stone on the board it's too late to jump here.]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[im];B[hk];W[fk];B[gj];W[gk];B[gl];W[fl];B[hj]
;W[ii]C[Kalle: All in all, you played well, you had many attacks going on in different parts of the board. There are two main things you might want to think about.

Firstly, the timing and direction of forcing moves. This came up when you were attacking the upper side white group and had a chance to build a moyo in the center.

Secondly, considering more flexibly and actively the possibilities of using your walls and thickness to create moyos on the sides and in the center of the board.

Take care! :)])

C[Kalle: This way you are actually attacking the marked stones, and there will be little left of the white center. White might also have to capture your bottom group stones to connect his wall. You will most probably get sente to block at A also.]
