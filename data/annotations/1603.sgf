C[Hi  Tristan,

First, I'd like to emphasize that I'm about 1 Dan. This means I make lots of  mistakes myself and that there are a lot of things I don't know. My remarks  reflect the few things I do know and *my* ideas about the game. With this as  an important sidenote, I'm sure you will get something out of the review,  and improve your game. *Be yourself* (c) The life of Brian.

(...)];B[pd]C[The game you played shows the following areas for improvement:

- the direction of play
- avoid unnecessary fights = sacrifice unimportant stones

You held the advantage for quite some time in the game, but a strategic  error, namely failing to sacrifice stones and build a position in the upper  right, made the game close.

There is a book by Kajiwara on the direction of play. Here is a link  http://math.stanford.edu/~carlton/go/g26.html. Replaying pro games also  gives feeling for that, especially in the middle game. Don't feel offended  if you actually thought this to be your strong point. It's a weak point of  mine, too.

;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn]C[(dv) I can see you  know your joseki. #:-7  It is important to know why you jump with B15. It  has everything to do with the "struggle to get ahead" - see Kageyama's  "Lessons in the fundamentals".  http://math.stanford.edu/~carlton/go/g28.html]

(;W[dn]LB[em:a][fp:b]C[Seems too soon to play this.

(dv)

It is not so much a question of timing, but of speed.
White's mistake is to neglect the "struggle to get ahead".

Var2 (a (E7)) and var3 (b (F4)) show two better options with comments.]
;B[cm]C[(dv) Black says "thank you".  Black gets additional territory,  while White gets almost nothing in return.]
;W[po]
(;B[np]LB[qo:a]C[(dv) This is the wrong direction. This move shows the  intention to develop along the lower side. That is precisely where white  already has a strong presence, so that is not really interesting. In  exchange, White extends along the right side, which is open space and thus  much more interesting.

I would prefer the "tsuke" at A (R5). The joseki in var2 gives the corner  and reduces the influence of the left White group. White still gets his  extension along the RS. The joseki in var3 gives a large corner and access  to the RS. White builds a moyo. var4 is another possibility.

Playing a pincer is also possible, but in view of the White influence, I'd  personally be reluctant to play it.

A stronger player will probably differentiate better than me. I'll post the  question on Sensei's Library.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[rr]LB[qj:a]C[(dv)
B23 is an agressive move. It is usually played when Black already has a  stone around A (R10). If you play the usual reinforcement instead, you could  take sente and alleviate the (small) mistake of B19. See  Var2.]
;W[ql];B[kq]C[(dv) After B23 you indeed need a reinforcement. Still,  the Black shape is rather thin.]
;W[no];B[op]LB[mp:a][mq:b]C[I don't like  being "told" where to play, but I couldn't see a better way to resist  White's plan of getting outside influence in exchange for profit.

(dv) I would prefer A (N4) to B27 because it also protects against the  invasion at B (m3). This move is on the 4th line, makes profit and  reinforces the thin group, so there is no reason to be unhappy about it,  even if you are "told" to play there.]
;W[mo]LB[qf:a][nc:b];B[qg]LB[mq:a]C[(dv) This move reduces White's  influence. It is a nice move. White has some action now against the LoR  group, such as fencing it in as in  the game and invading at A (M3), but not  severe enough  to make you play there instead.

In any case, here you display a good sense of direction.]
(;W[kp]C[(dv) This move fences Black in.  See var2 for  the invasion at A  (M3).

In general, it is not advised to let yourself be fenced in, but the Black  group should live easily with some 10+ points territory. White gets enormous  central thickness, but Black can continue to play far away from  it.]
;B[jq]LB[lq:a]C[(dv)

My comments before were merely suggestions and second thoughts. This move  here however, I would call a clear cut bad move.

Drawing back at A (M3) is better];W[jp]C[(dv)

The proverb says: hane at the head of two stones. This shape is advantageous  for the side who hanes in 95 % of the cases, and in 100% of the cases if the  cutting point is backed up. Allowing your opponent to make this shape is  bad. (= more criticism on 31)]
;B[ir];W[hr]C[(dv) A double hane is one of the  things you can expect after a "hane at the head" but in this case it invites  aggressive countermeasures.]
;B[hq]LB[rq:a]C[This starts an exchange in which  I give up my profit on the lower side in exchange for an attack on the d6  group and erasing White's influence.

(dv)

You not only give up profit. You put the life of your LoR corner in danger.  In exchange you plan to attack the White chain in the LoL.  What can both  sides expect from the attack ? Black will probably make more territory at  the left side, while White will become thick around 28-30 and can occupy a  large endgame point at A (s3) in sente.

All of this doesn't seem really bad, but very aggressive.];W[ip]
;B[gr];W[jr];B[hs];W[lq];B[kr];W[lr];B[js];W[nr];B[or]C[(dv) Correct. This is the  vital point. Still not completely safe.]

(;W[rq]C[(dv)
Grabs the points in sente. See the variation for some severe  alternative.]
;B[mp]C[This looks like a mistake. Black loses the aji of  cutting at m4.

(dv) Agree];W[lp];B[nq];W[mr];B[oo];W[on];B[pn]C[I knew this doesn't  accomplish anything at the moment, but I hoped to generate some aji. Shame I  couldn't find a way to use it!

(dv) Pushing at the last move (B51) generated the aji. That was good. It is  not really necessary to cut rightaway but it is not really bad  either.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[gn]C[(dv)

Good splitting move with nice shape.];W[pp]C[(dv)

If Black played this move before B57, White had most probably answered and  Black would have lived in sente.]
;B[ps];W[go];B[fo]LB[ho:a][lo:b]C[Was this  the wrong side? Perhaps h5 was better?

(dv)

The principle goes "Hane from the other side than you want to cut". Here it  is not clear where you should cut. Given the continuation, this move is OK.]
;W[fn];B[fp]C[(dv)

Good. Resisting to play the atari is very  important.];W[ho]
;B[en];W[dm];B[fm]C[(dv)

With the ponnuki, Much of White's central influence goes to waste, and he  gets a weak and heavy group. Black's aggressive strategy is successful.

Remind however the severe variation diagram I gave for the LoR corner.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[ck]C[(dv)

Good.

Very important to stretch here. Jumping would indeed get ahead of white, but  leave a severe cutting point. Judging whether a cutting point is severe or  not is mostly a matter of reading. However "stretch to four then jump" is a  good principle (note that at 15 you jumped from bent but connected four, and  also met with appraisal).]
;W[hm];B[dj]LB[om:a][nn:b][ok:c]C[(dv)

Wrong direction. Black must continue the cut and play F9. White will keep  running and you run along on the left side making territory. When his group  is safe, you play Black A(p7), White B(o6), Black C(p9) and White has  nothing.

If White hanes after you jump, you cut.];W[fk];B[ej]C[(dv)

Same idea. You must cut at G8 here, otherwise white connects and has his  central thickness back in business.]
;W[fl];B[cf]C[(dv) I know what you are  trying to accomplish: the last three moves have made additional territory.  While you are *making* territory, the opponent makes something else, in this  case, central thickness. If you attack from the right direction, you will  *receive* territory for free.]
;W[ns]C[This seems like aji keshi to me.

(dv) Agree. These kind of "0 points in sente" moves are ko-threats thrown  away.]
;B[os];W[ls]C[(dv) One point gote move in the middle game. Equals a  free move for Black.

This may be a good opportunity to make a positional judgment - unless this  is a 4/1 game on IGS, of course.

BLACK

LeS: 25 points
UR: a shimari, worth appr. 15 points
LoS: +- 10 points

total 50 points

WHITE
LoR: 10 pts
Komi: 5 pts

total: 15 points, plus central influence with quite a few cutting points,  difficult to measure in terms of points.

Since Black has the next move, it will be difficult for White to transform  his central influence into something that recovers his being 35 points  behind.

An extremely valuable but also extremely dry book is
"Positional judgment" by Cho Chikun.
http://math.stanford.edu/~carlton/go/g45.htm]
(;B[fd]C[(dv)
The double kakari is certainly a good way to use your sente. In var2 I  propose an alternative.]
;W[ks]C[(dv) Another ko-threat thrown  away.];B[jr];W[gp]C[(dv)
Truly, White is playing purposeless moves here.];B[fr];W[fs]
;B[gq];W[df]
(;B[ce]C[(dv) A bit meek. This is a move for when you have already built up  strength at the US.  See var 2 and 3.]
;W[de];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[cg];W[hd];B[ff]LB[jd:a]C[(dv)

The Black 83 stone has enabled you to increase your territory to 30 points  and has served its purpose. The time has come to sacrifice it. The best way  to do this is by playing A (k16) and build a position on the  UR.]
;W[fc];B[gd]C[(dv)

You're giving White free territory and a target for attack. It could well be  that the game reaches a turning point here.

Just throw those stones away, and build a position in the UR.]
;W[gc];B[he];W[ie];B[id];W[hc];B[if];W[je];B[hf];W[jf];B[jg]
;W[kg];B[jh];W[nd]LB[gl:a][hn:b]C[(dv)

The result of this exchange is that White has built a territory of about 30  points at the top. Black has built a +- strong group in return. Black should  make use of it to cut at A (F8) or B(H6). But Black is stirring things up  while he's ahead - the opposite of what should be done.]
;B[pc]LB[nb:a]C[(dv)Good.

This is the proper move to protect the corner in this situation. Moreover,  it threatens to slide into White'  territory]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[nb]C[(dv)

Good.];W[jj]LB[gl:a][kh:b]C[(dv)

White is now really playing at another level than before. This is a very  important point:

- It protects against the cut at A (G8)
- It attempts to build additional thickness at B (L12)
- It starts making territory in the center];B[kh]C[(dv) Good.]
;W[lg]LB[mc:a][qj:b][dg:c][bb:d]C[(dv)

Although some of the groups still contain weaknesses, the endgame has begun.  First a positional judgment:

BLACK

LeS 30+
UR 20+
LoS 10

WHITE

US +- 20
Center + RS 30+
komi 5

So the game draws close, but you are still ahead and you have the next move.  Large endgame points are at

A (N17)
B (R10)
C (D13)
D (B18)

A being the largest by far.];B[kj];W[kk];B[lj];W[gi];B[lk];W[hh]
;B[ih];W[ii];B[jk]C[(dv)

A mistake. Give atari from the other  side.];W[kl];B[ij];W[ji]

;B[nl];W[mn];B[ol];W[ml];B[mk];W[pk]C[(dv)

Up till here White's center has effectively and irrevokably become  territory, about 20+ points. You have connected your stones, but this big  dragon is still not completely safe.

The dragon has come to life because you were determined to save the  unimportant stones  at F16 and at  Q6-Q7.]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[mm];W[nn];B[mi];W[ob]C[(dv)

Because you had to assure life for the dragon, White takes the very large  endgame point at 158, playing a nice "tesuji".]

The ill-mannered one here is your opponent. See end  statement.]
;W[jl];B[jm];W[ik];B[ko];W[lo];B[sn];W[rn]C[(dv)

When reviewing the endgame, I became wary of something. I assume this game  was played over the internet, and from the playing style I am pretty  convinced that someone took over for White at some point in the game. His  endgame is flawless, in any case I can't see any mistake, and myself as  a 1  Dan, I'm known for playing a good endgame.

At move 122 I made the incidental remark that "White is playing at another  level now". With hindsight, I'm certain that this is actually true. In  particular White 114, 116 and 122 are moves that show at least Dan-level  skill, if not very high Dan level. I think he took over around move 90.  Moves 86 and 88 are the last questionable moves of his.

This was not a fair contest, so don't worry about the loss. Take pride in  having made it so close against a strong player. Maybe avoid this opponent  in the future # : - 7. Maybe it's just a kid who had to go to bed and his 6  Dan father prevented the "escape".
