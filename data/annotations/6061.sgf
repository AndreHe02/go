[pl:B]C[Too far away. No need to go out of the joseki. A is the normal move, but B can be interesting when you already have a presence on the right side, and you want to develop it. 
Q10 let a invasion point that your opponent will be able to use, later in the game.]
;W[jd];B[dj];W[jp];B[cn];W[jf]LB[df:A][fq:B]C[The 0 point move. Be glad and take advantage of this kind of move :)
Take a large point, now, before White can get it. I prefer B but A is developing the left side, and it's not a bad move.]
;B[pf]C[This is not bad too, but D14 would have been better, I think, because the less side is almost virgin. If Q16 is attacked, there are many ways to deal with it.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[rc]C[smartnik: I believe this is a bad mistake that lets white have big advantage here; I should play p17 instead; is that right?

Yes, it's a big mistake. You're right, P17 is far better.];W[od]
;B[oe];W[nd];B[gc]C[I'm not fond of this move. F17 is better I think. Besides, you still can play F3, there is still no need to strengthen D16.]
;W[rb]
(;B[sc]C[What are you thinking about? :)

There are a lot of more importants points! 
C15 protect you from an invasion at the san san point, and you can attack F3 now; do it before you can't.
T17 is a yose move, and a little one; you hadn't reached chuban yet, you're still at the fuseki. So don't bother is your opponent is taking 5-10 points, as long as you're taking 20-30 and more points elsewhere.
If I should elect a move now, it would be C15.];W[sb]C[Here again! Forgot your two stones and strike where it hurts! 
F3 is the only move.]
(;B[re];W[cc]C[Bam.];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[db]C[I'm not sure you gain something, the joseki is at least as best.]
;W[cb];B[fb];W[da]
(;B[ed]C[No! Much too slow, and you lose sente without nothing in exchange!]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ad];B[ae];W[bb];B[cf]C[Compared this to the variation to get a glimpse of what you missed.]
;W[cl]C[I think it's not good. Go to the variation to see why.]

(;B[dl];W[cm];B[dm];W[bn];B[ck];W[bk]
(;B[bm];W[bl];B[bo];W[am];B[do]C[It's a strange development. With your upper wall, one would have thought that you would have developed the left side. And now, it's devastated.]

(;W[cq]
(;B[bp]C[smartnik: maybe I should make a more efficient move now? k17 or f3 or g5 or something like that...

A more effcient move now, that's for sure. What move, though, I don't know...]
;W[bq];B[ao]C[Hey, what's that? ;)
You're 14k, make sure you don't make any more empty triangles...B10 again is better.This move is useless, as nearly all the empty triangles.]

(;W[an];B[bj];W[ak];B[aj];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[cp];W[eq];B[fn]
;W[gn]TR[fn]C[That is a bad exchange for you. Now, you cannot invade the bottom anymore. At least, it's getting very difficult.]

(;B[go];W[gp];B[ho];W[hn];B[hp]C[smartnik: trying to save the g5-h5 group looks stupid; but what would be more efficient? k17 right now?

I still don't get the point of K17. Write me to explain, and if you want more precisions ;)]
;W[gq];B[in];W[hm]C[Very, very bad...]

(;B[kn];W[km];B[lm];W[jn];B[jc]C[No, the battle's not here, now. Don't let the fight go into his hands, never. Fight until the fate of your stones is clear.]

;W[no];B[pm]C[Well, ok, but you have to see that all your moves served to nothing. And you can't do any more points in the center.]

;W[gm];B[el]C[You get a 0.5 point whit this move. I'm sure you will find bigger move ;)]

Of course. It's always a few less points for him.];W[me]C[I didn't see it. You see, now, how bad L16 was. Make sure you read well when you try little tricks.]
