C[
 tom 5k*: hard for you in this area.  with cut at J3 needed to 
strengthen one group or other
 JamesL 15k*: true - but i should be able to build strength by chasing your middle group
 JamesL 15k*: i just don't want to chase it the wrong way
 tom 5k*: true, just earlier the cut was something to note and remember
 JamesL 15k*: right, i thought about j3, but didn't see how important it was
 tom 5k*: not J3, perhaps K3
 tom 5k*: or even L3 :-)
 tom 5k*: J6 also possibility, build moyo if I cut
 JamesL 15k*: right, didn't think about those, considered j5
 tom 5k*: good direction
 tom 5k*: also at C5, possibly D3 or C4 better, definite cut
 JamesL 15k*: ok, i'll have to look at that again
 tom 5k*: I am using say so should be in game record
 JamesL 15k*: thanks
 JamesL 15k*: now i'm considering k5, j9 and something to prevent an invasion in the upper left corner
 JamesL 15k*: not sure if i should strengthen the UL before chasing your group in the middle
 tom 5k*: groups without eyes are most vital now
