C[Anhanguera [11k\]: hello
itrythis1 [11k\]: hi

White loses this game in miserable fashion. But it's not because of just a bad day - i think i commited several very bad moves with easy mind and collapse quickly after realizing i'm far behind...

I think this game illustrates gaps in the way i'm thinking, so it would be nice to get hints especially about moves, which are wrong in a general, strategic sense.

[Calvin\] Hi. I'll try my best to make useful comments on things that I see differently about this game, but remember that I am a weak player too and there is much that I will not catch.]
;B[dd]C[itrythis1 [11k\]: have a nice game!];W[pp]C[Anhanguera [11k\]: u2]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qe]
(;W[md]LB[jc:A]C[Wrong for two reasons, i guess:
1) Too close to b strong corner
2) No way to develop after a pincer on e.g. L16, i can only run in no mans land.

[Calvin\] Correct on both counts.  Also, it is easier to make a solid base if the invasion is on the 3rd line.  See variations.

It's worth noting that eventually this stone dies.  So if it is a mistake, it might be worth treating it lightly now. :-)]
(;B[qg]C[[Calvin\] Slow move.  See variation.]
(;W[qm]TR[pc][qe][qg]C[(K16 instead?)

[Calvin\] Black has invested the three stones in a strong, tight formation.  This blights the right side of the board and makes it uninteresting for the time being.  It's good for W8 to keep a distance, but this move should be played later.   Right now white should help his N16 stone.   See variation.]
;B[kc]
(;W[qj]C[Good or bad???
Not small due to extension point for both - but isn't strengthening of N16 more urgent?

[Calvin\]  This move is totally uninteresting at this time.  Black is not about to play here.  See variation.]
;B[ke];W[mf];B[kg];W[mh]TR[md][mf]C[[Calvin\] Black is already controlling the flow of the game.  White's marked stones are running on dame points, and black is building a nice framework on the left in sente.  The mistakes at white 6 and 10 are looking quite costly.]
;B[pi]C[[Calvin\] This is a leaning attack.];W[ki]C[[Calvin\] It's good to get ahead like this.]
;B[li]C[[Calvin\] Cutting a knight's move like this depends on a ladder, which is not working for black right now.]
;W[lh]C[During the game i still wasn't pessimistic at all....
Appears rather strange to me afterwards. B is (far) ahead in strength AND influence, how can this be good?]
;B[kh];W[lj];B[pl]
(;W[ok]TR[qm]C[(proudly recognizing Q8 as a ladder block...)

[Calvin\] Doing this just allows black free forcing moves.    Plus, the shape made by white's marked stones is a classic bad one called an elephant's eye with black now right at the vital point.  See variations.]
;B[oj];W[ni]SQ[li]LB[mi:A]C[[Calvin\] It looks ilke white is only concerned about the marked black stone pulling out.  I still think the solid capture at A (N11) is better.]
;B[nj]
(;W[mj]C[[Calvin\] White doesn't need to answer here.  See variation.]
;B[nk]TR[mj][ni][ok]C[[Calvin\] The result is a terrible broken shape for white.]
;W[pk];B[nl];W[ol];B[hd]
(;W[cm]SQ[nk][nl]C[Still felt optimistic.... i liked my center stones, thinking "just catch up in moyo and all will be well....."

[Calvin\] It is hard to make this a moyo game for white.  The marked black stones poke in.  Besides, this is not a moyo move.]
;B[jq]
(;W[mq]C[[Calvin\] I'd prefer to squeeze from the other direction.  See variation.]
;B[np]TR[qq]C[[Calvin\] This move is a terrible aji keshi (erasure of potential).  Before this, black had the ability to invade at R3.  (This is called the "Butterfly" formation.  See http://senseis.xmp.net/?Butterfly.)   After white answers, it is much harder for black to invade.]
;W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[pm];B[nn]
(;W[qq]C[I still felt optimistic: "now all is healthy, soon i attack."

[Calvin\] It's not very healthy, because this the the wrong connection.  :-)   See variation.]
(;B[mp]
(;W[gq]TR[cm][dp][mq][pp][qm]C[[Calvin\] Interesting.  White makes the butterfly twice in one game. :-)  What does white want here?   See variations.]
;B[ci];W[cf]TR[ci][hd]C[Planning C17....think i should have done this immediatly...

[Calvin\] Yeah, black has two short extensions, so the 3-3 point is normal and easy.]
;B[cd]C[...since now it's impossible?!];W[dh]TR[ci]C[[Calvin\]  I'm not sure what white is doing here.  This is the kind of move white might play if white thought that it was possible to attack black's marked stone severely.  But black has strength in this area and a fair amount of room, so it could backfire for white.]
;B[di];W[eh];B[ei];W[bj]C[[Calvin\] Is white trying to kill black?  This is not realistic.]
(;B[bi];W[ih]LB[fh:A][ji:B]C[Hoping to link all up - seems weird afterwards?!

[Calvin\] Dream on.  Black has the hane at A and the atari at B as resources here.]
;B[ji];W[kj];B[ii];W[jh]C[W was already far behind, but the invasion at C14 was a complete failure on top.

SQ[ag][bf][cf][dg][dh][eh][ef][ih][jh][li][pl]C[I assume it was not possible to kill blacks left group ( at least a 12k can't reasonably hope to manage that....).
Here (finally) i thought W will not simply loose, but rather get blown off the board....

[Calvin\] This move is gote.  Black answers, but does not have to.  So let's estimate the score.   Black's upper left is almost 80 points, at least 15 in the upper right and can make maybe 5 points in the center.  White is harder to count, because black can live by playing at C3.  Even we assume white plays there now instead of C10, it's maybe 40 points in the lower left.  On the lower right, black still has the chance to play R6, so white may only make 20 points in the lower right.  Komi is  6.5.  White's L10 group actually doesn't have two eyes yet and may come under attack if black plays in the area of K7.  Maybe that group is negative points because black can gain more by attacking it than white can from defending.

Black is quite far ahead.  If I have gnugo finish this game from here, black wins by about 40 points.  So this is a resigning position for white.

However, later on a huge mistake on black's part makes the game close, so one never knows!]

;B[fj];W[gl];B[ek];W[fl];B[gj];W[nm];B[mm];W[om];B[kk]C[[Calvin\] A little dangerous for black...]
;W[ml]C[[Calvin\] Good idea!];B[mk];W[ll];B[lk];W[kl]C[Finally overlooking tha atari (but even this contains some logic in view of the course of the game...).]
;B[mi]SQ[nn][pn][po][op][mp][np]LB[lp:A][jq:B][mm:C]C[I wthink it wasn't too early to resign here?!

[Calvin\] The game is a lot closer now that this exchange has been made.  If you can kill black's marked group, maybe starting with the hane at A (M4), then black is still ahead by a few points, but an endgame mistake on black's part may allow a comeback.

Some things to take away from this game.

W6: K17 is the normal move.  W6 itself isn't a game-losing mistake.  It's more how the stone is treated by later moves by white.  4th line moves in a strong area of the opponent can be considered light.  It may enhance your game to first think of ways to sacrifice such stones rather than to defend them.  An early sacrifice may look big, bit it can give you many sente moves and ko threats later.

W10: Try not following your opponent around.  The biggest area of the board is usually where neither player has stones.  Also, remember the proverb "your opponent's good move is your good move."

W22 and W24: I think you can see the value of capturing a ladder stone cleanly rather than getting into a ladder breaker fight. Compare the game result to one where this stone is taken right away.

W34 and W46: Your opponent didn't punish this, but remember that the butterfly shape has a serious weakness:  http://senseis.xmp.net/?Butterfly

W48 through W56: This is where white fell very far behind.  The expectations were just too unrealistic.

Finally, at the end it may have been worth a few more plays.   The game was closer than you think after black made a mistake.

Your play is pretty good for 11k and I'm sure you'll improve quickly.  In the future if you find yourself with a single stone that's hard to defend, consider letting it hang out and not defending it right away or at all.  Throughout the game, it's often more important for a stone to be dead and useful than alive and a burden.  The more I look at the opening in this game, the more I'm inclined to view W6 / B7 as a kikashi, and we treat kikashi stones like W6 lightly.  That's not the same as saying you should continue to play W6, though.  It's just a way of thinking after black has played a slow move like B7.]
