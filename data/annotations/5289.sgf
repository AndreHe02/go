C[I am white, and am attempting to play an influence orientated game. However, some early errors in fuseki gave my opponent far more influence than myself, and I was left facing huge moyos. As it turned out, my opponent allowed a group to die, and prompty resigned (unnecessarily in my opinion, he was still ahead), but I'm more concerned about my choice of moves in the opening and the early middle game that put me on the back foot so early.

Thanks for any advice!

;W[hh]C[Oddly enough, black resigned here. Which was ridiculous, as black was definitely still in the game. Clearly Black hadn't bothered counting. The worrying aspect from my point of view is that I needed to kill that large black group merely to be close.

Mirage: When opponents invade your territories, think of large scale attack (ie. attack whole group). Always look for critical points of moyos (eg. O14 in this game).]
