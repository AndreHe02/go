Hi, senko.
First of all, please forgive my poor english.

My comments will begin with [A\]
See the end of the game for a global comment and a few advices.

If I have used Japanese words you don't understand, please refer to : http://senseis.xmp.net (the Go Bible !)

If you have any question on the comments or about particular variations, please feel free to contact me by e-mail.

And finally, keep in mind that my comments are just my opinion and not uncontestable truth.

Hope it helps,

Thanks to the initial handicap, B already has an option in three corners.
I think it would be better to challenge him in one of these corners. 
This move is probably not big enough to be played that early in the game.

Furthermore,it doesn't really close the corner (A or B would be better for this purpose).]
;B[jd];W[jj]TR[cf][df][pf][qf][cj][cn][dn][fp][jp][fq][jq]C[[A\]
During the very beginning of the game, it's more usual to take big points on the sides of the board. Which doesn't mean that playing in the center is necessarily bad. But it's the kind of move that need to serve a very precise purpose since it doesn't really help you building immediate territory.

I think all the marked spots are possible alternatives.];B[qf]
;W[qh];B[md]
(;W[cq]LB[cf:I][df:H][cj:G][dj:F][cn:E][dn:D][fp:B][jp:A][fq:C]
C[Should I have played e5 and try to make black live small instead?

[A\]
Playing the san-san (3-3 point) under a hoshi (4-4) stone usually leads to :
- W takes the corner
- B builds big outside influence (a 'big wall' like in this game)
This is not what W should want now because the influence B is going to get is worth more than the ~20 points of territory that W will get.
San-san invasion can become, though, a very interesting option later on.

About your other idea (E5), please see the variation.

Personnaly, I would consider moves A to I instead of C3.];B[cp]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[ep]LB[fq:A][fr:B]C[[A\]
Nothing wrong so far.
For your information, the Black joseki moves are A and B, instead of E4, which is a bit too slow.]
;W[bp];B[bo];W[ap];B[co];W[bq];B[ao];W[fq]C[[A\]
This is a standard result after an 3-3 invasion : W got the corner, B got a wall creating side oriented influence.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[fp];W[fs];B[gq];W[fr];B[gp]LB[ci:C][cj:B][dj:A]
C[[A\]
Black went on building an very big wall.

Now there is a very important point to play for both sides, which is situated around A/B/C.
Can you see why ?

A wall doens't really work well until it has an extension on the side.
See both variations for explanations.]
(;W[hq]C[[A\]
Like I said before, this move (and all the following B & W moves) should be around D10 / D11.
H3 is nice, but clearly smaller.];B[hp];W[iq];B[jq];W[jr];B[jp]
;W[kp]C[I wanted to protect my position at the right here.
(didnt have any other position thou. should i have played somewere left earlier? (but end up with a weaker position at the right side) )

[A\]
Your right side is ok. There are still weaknesses, of course, but if you add moves to consolid your position, you will be late on the rest of the board and thus be in a difficult position.
As you suggest it, I think White's priority should be to settle a position on the left side.]
;B[kq];W[lq];B[kr];W[ks];B[ls];W[is];B[js]TR[kp][lq]C[could i have prevented black from separating my stones?

[A\]
After L4, I can't see a way to prevent Black from cutting your bottom left and your right side.
But at your I wouldn't really bother about this. If White's priority was to protect you lower right corner, a move like P3 or N3 would have made the job.
Instead of this your M3 and L4 stone look quite weak and unefficient. A this stage the area around O3 can be considered as Black's privilege. You will need later on to protect your corner with a move like P3.

As a conclusion to this sequence, I would say that you should think more about the global position and forget the local fight as soon as White and Black groups are not in danger. That's is to say after move 25.]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[lr];B[ip]TR[kp][lq][lr]C[would n1 have been better from black's point of view?

[A\]
In this local position, B J4 is not urgent since the three marked stones are weak.
Later, a cut at A would push White into a difficult position.
Nevertheless, I think Black is ahead so he doesn't need to take risks.
A move around C11 is still the biggest priority.

Nota :
Some complicated local fights can begin from here. It's difficult to point out the best line for both sides. I deleted your many variations because I prefer to concentrate on the main line.]
;W[lp];B[hs];W[hr];B[dr];W[cr]C[Here i considered my group safe.
(but the black wall don't look too friendly: :-)

[A\]
As shown by the last moves, your group is safe (it was safe after move 25).]
;B[dj]C[is my following moves too defensive?

[A\]
Black finally takes this huge point.
I think White needs to invade or reduce Black's potential.
Defending the right side won't probably be enough.];W[jm]C[[A\]
see previous comment...];B[em]C[[A\]
This Black move doesn't really serve any goal.
The proverb says : "Dont't play too close to a wall"];W[jn]
TR[dc][fc][cd][fd][gd][cf][df][dg]C[[A\]
Once more, very slow and defensive move !
Maybe White should try to invade the upper left (the other B positions are too strong). It's hard to find the good point to invade. Personally, Iwould consider one of the marked spots and get prepared for a difficult fight :)]
;B[dg]C[[A\]
Black quietly transforms his potential into territory.];W[pf]
C[[A\]
This is the wrong direction. Black is very stong in this area.]
;B[qe];W[qg];B[rf]LB[ec:B][jg:A]C[[A\]
Not very good from Black.
A move around A or B would be MUCH bigger.

In a moyo game (two large areas of influence facing each other), the biggest moves are often situated on the border between the areas.]
;W[rg];B[sf];W[sg]C[[A\]
very small !
This move is worth 1 point and loses the initiative. Which means it is almost as if you passed your turn.
It is Black's mistake to play T14. You don't need to follow him into useless moves !
Invading or reducing Black's moyo is probably worth like 30 points or more.....
I let you judge :)];B[pe];W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg];B[lf]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[kh];B[jg];W[ji];B[ih];W[jh];B[ig]C[[A\]
After this sequence maybe you were happy to have consolidated your territory, but don't forget that Black is probably even happier.
There's no room left for you to reduce or invade excepted..........]
;W[cc]C[[A\]
...... at the 3-3 point !
Good.
At this stage of the game you definitely need an invasion.
3-3 is ok now that Black's positions are settled on the top and left.
Can you see why it is good now, and why it was bad at move 9 ?

In fact Black should have protected his corner with E17 before. This is your chance to come back in the game :)]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bd];W[bc];B[bf];W[ad]LB[db:A]C[[A\]
This variation is not the best W can get after B B16 (some difficult variations may begin from there)
Now Black can play A sente (see variation)

But it's ok : If no mistakes, W is alive.]
(;B[de]C[[A\]
not needed];W[af]C[[A\]
This is a small endgame move.
As the following moves demonstrate, it doesn't give White an eye (which he doensn't need anyway).]
;B[ag];W[ae];B[bg];W[db]C[[A\]
W don't need this move to live
A move around G10 or O2 might be bigger.];B[eb];W[ea]C[this was a mistake on my part think.

[A\]
Right.
But if White doesn't try to resist, B can't kill the corner (see variations)]

(;B[fa];W[da]LB[cb:A]C[[A\]

;W[jo]C[i should maybe have played h6 instead. i guess i'm a bit paranoid. :-)
or would that be unwise?

[A\]
You should have locked the lower right with O2 which is bigger than K5 or H6.]
;B[hn];W[ms]C[[A\]
Should be at O2 !

After a black cut at N2, your lower right will be badly reduced.]

B18 would have been slightly better, but after B19 White is still alive if he plays A.
So the wrong move is the next one at M10 !]

Without the upper left seki, the game would have been even. I think you are both quite the same level, since we may assume that a 2 stones handi is worth ~20 points.

This is a good game for KGS 25k players. I would give the same advice to you, Senko and to your adversary, mostly about your playing during the opening :

1. ALWAYS keep in mind the global position on the board.
I mean, even if you are in a local fight (like in the lower left in this game), as soon as your position is safe (at move 25, for example), take some time to observe the rest of the board, to evaluate the positions and always ask yourself : where is the biggest point, where are my opponent's weakneses ? And you'll see that it's often elsewhere (invading a side, attacking a corner).

2. don't follow your opponent all over the board. He might make mistakes or useless moves. Winning a go game is making less mistakes than your opponent. If you follow him everywhere on the board, you'll never take the initiative and you won't take profit of his mistakes.

3. Keep the initiative (sente). If your opponent makes a bad/slow move, just discard it and take the initiative. Also don't lose the initiative by playing yourself slow or useless moves.

Accoding to me, the 2 best ways to improve at your level are :
- playing !! but don't play too fast games. It's better to play a slow and collected game than 3 fast ones.

- observe many dan/pro games. Don't try to understand every move or to study it in details, but just try to feel the pace, the style, to observe and 'feel' the whole board, the overall playing direction... Even if you won't notice it quickly, this will learn you a lot !

Black gets this very big point and thus takes a big lead.

White now has to invade (hard to find a good spot) or to reduce Black's moyo (territorial framework).]
))
(;W[eo]C[[A\]
This move is very unusual (no joseki from here) and I can't find a way for White to get a good result.
Since it is played very high (line 5), its purpose must be to build central influence. Not to build territory (which is probably the reason why it is never played that early in the game).]
;B[ep];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[bn];W[dm];B[bp];W[dj];B[hq]C[[A\]
