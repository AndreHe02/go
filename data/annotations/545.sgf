i think k13 looks better.];W[mc]C[o17 is the vital point now, then he gets aji in the corner and n18 for making eyes.

now m16 was a good move :)];B[fd]C[this is nonsense, k13 is very important now, later you can still play there.]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[de];W[ce];B[eh]C[what do you want? the way you played means, you split yourself, you have 2 groups instead of 1. he can connect at f18, so he is in no danger at all. k17 starts to look weak, so it will be hard to attack his group n17.]
