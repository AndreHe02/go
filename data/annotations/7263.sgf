C[Hello, dear reviewer!

I am HonFu in the GTL and on KGS. My real name is Bernd, and I'm a German 2k.

I have some questions about this game (especially about the size of moves, proper direction and the handling of an invasion) which I entered as comments in this file. But since I want to improve generally, please don't hesitate to tell me everything else you see too! Especially I would be grateful for general principles which I can apply in other games.

Thank you very much!

Hello Bernd!

You game is quite solid. You show good knowledge of direction of play, though at times it's very hard to determine where next to play.
The only weakness (if you would even call it that) that I noticed was that sometimes you didn't respond severely enough to invasions. But this can be quite hard to do. The most important thing is that you have to change your mindset somewhat to making sure your opponent has the worst possible shape. Perhaps some of the moves I mentioned you didn't notice, but it's important to learn how to respond severely to invasions like these.
I have tried to address your major concerns. If I left out anything you weren't sure about or you have additional questions, feel free to e-mail me.

I can't agree with this.
In conjunction with Black's strength in the top-right, Black should be able to either gain territory on the center-right or chase a baselsss group towards his strength.

But here, White can easily live by sliding at A or playing the hane at B. In addition, the cut at C isn't ideal, as you saw later in the game.]

(;B[fq]LB[gq:A]C[Here I would play at A to attack more strongly.]
;W[lq]C[Here I wondered if I should kakari, but white's play on P3 looked too convenient for him. So I rather postponed the kakari ...]

(;B[nq]LB[pr:A][rm:B][rn:C]C[... and defended my weak point instead, tightening him in at the same time. Was this reasonable or too shy?

It can't be helped - this is the proper move.
It does put some pressure on both the bottom-center group and the lower-right corner - A is no longer sente for White, so only B is left (thus making C a larger move for Black).]

LB[lo:A][pl:B]C[This isn't bad, but first I would like to press at A - the cut at B is somewhat severe for White, but with Black A , Black's group can easily escape in the center.]

(;W[ed];B[ic];W[qb];B[kc];W[lb]C[Giving him R18 was unpleasant, but spreading conveniently on the upper side, where he was strong, looked alright for me. I thought, if he doesn't get to start a very good attack, he should have no development potential left now, while I got more stake in the center. I felt a bit nervous, but still on a good course.]
;B[ch];W[bp]C[So now he comes in. This invasion I seem to handle rather bad. instead of walling him in tightly or making him weak ...]
;B[cq];W[co]TR[ck][ch]LB[cn:A]C[I believe A would be better in this case - especially since the marked are close and with A, the stones would become, more or less, settled.]

Now I had to decide live or kill, and decided (I think) for the wrong ...

I would play A. It may seem bad, but it's actually very good.]

(;B[cs]LB[ao:A]C[Anyways, this isn't so big, as you can escape. White would have to play here or at A to make her corner group live, which is much more painful than being able to make a semeai.]

;W[hp]C[Luckily enough he gave me sente ...];B[mg]SQ[fc][ic]
[kc][ld]C[... so I could go on trying to make at least some points of my influence. Was this the right direction or were other things bigger?

I don't see a problem with this. As long as you were sure that the marked stones were safe enough, this was fine.]

;W[mr];B[fg]LB[eg:A][ff:B]C[This is one of the moves one gets often criticized for, but my thinking was that closing off the center was my largest play now anyway. But was it enough to win? I felt my opponent started to help me a bit now ...

Personally, I don't see a problem with this. Allowing White A or B would significantly shrink your moyo.]
