joeb331 [8k\]: hello
joeb331 [8k\]: gg


joeb331: I left the game text in, but it shouldn't be too troublesome as very little was said. This was a 4 stone game with my friend. No real epic battles happened or anything, I am just looking for any general advice (opening, middle-game, and end-game) on how I could have done better. I'm sure my friend will want a copy as well but I don't have his email so a review for both sides would be helpful and I can show it to him when he's here.
Thank you for taking the time to review this for me.];W[nq]
C[****
Hi, my name is Daniele. In case you have any doubt regarding this game or question of any kind, please feel free to contact me.

Some general advice for both of you:

B. Sometimes, especially in the opening, you are a little slow. Try to take the biggest point on the board.

W. Some mistakes about direction of play in the opening. In the middle game you missed the invasion in the lower side (you tried, but it was too late).

Endgame
In the endgame is important to take first the double sente points (sente for both players).
Then sente (for only a player), then reverse sente (sente for the opponent, gote for you) and at least gote.]

There are a lot of joseki to approach the star point. I'll show you some simple ones.]

joeb331 [8k\]: should be interesting
joeb331 [8k\]: trying to think how many pincer josekis i know

joeb331: I've seen this played before so I had an idea of how to play this, however any advice on correct direction/josekis that should have been played instead would be appreciated. As it was, I went with what seemed like a good position.

In handicap games pincer joseki are usually better for W because they often leads to tangled battles.]
