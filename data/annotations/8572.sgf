C[Dear reviewer,

I played W in this game as part of our local club competition, where we play 1:30 each + byo-yomi. I did not record the moves during play, only created this SGF the following day. I know it contains some flaws especially in the endgame, but i found no way to correct them. I still added the endgame to show which point me and my opponent got, rather than the exact order.

Lately i've been playing 3-4 points a lot, but as i cannot be bothered learning all joseki of 3-4 approaches and pincers at the moment, i abandoned that and switched to san san opening completely. This avoids early fighting and leads more to balanced games, quit fuseki and this rewards a good feel for the direction of play. My understanding of the direction of play is one of the things i like to develop more. Consuming reviews of GTL helped me with that already, but I would like more sansan opening games on GTL, and that's one of the reasons to submit this review.

Me and my opponent have an estimated EGF-rating of around 1900 (2 kyu). However, since i've only been playing for a year, i can easily be lured into traps or misjudge positions completely due to lack of experience.

I don't mind that to much, actually i enjoy entering a trap, seeing how it closes around me, review the trap and learn to recognize and/or apply it in later games.

I also tend to tenuki if i feel i cannot be killed/enclosed in one move. In this game this really backfired at me, as central fighting (due to a weakness i left, and subsequent running with weak stones) ultimately mostly reduced my top group. Could you please help me develop a feeling of positions where i can let my opponent make the next move, mostly in the fuseki stage of the game?

I added comments and questions on several moves to explain my inentions and/or doubts when playing them. I hope these help you reviewing my play. Please do feel free to challenge any of my comments.

Thanks in advance,
Paul];B[dp]C[N: Hello,
It seems you think about the/your game quite a lot and this shows a good attitude. 
It is hard to comment on all the things you mention ahead and during the game, but I picked some spots were I found a remark or idea usefull.

Your main mistake during the game was your miss to make a living shape in the lower right. This would have made things a lot easier for you. Otherwise it seemed at some times you have a tendencie to play too heavy and maybe this would be the easiest way to improve for you? As a second biggest mistake, maybe you showed some bad judgement thinking you were behinfd, were I had the feeling it was still well playable.

My comments are preceded by "N:"

Hoping you find the comments/ideas usefull,
Nelis (Lambic)];W[qq];B[dc];W[qc]C[I started playing san san recently because i found 3-4 pincer joseki too complex and because i feel 4-4 does not suit my territorial style.]
;B[pj];W[cf]C[I choose the distant low approach whenever i can to avoid complex pincer variations.]
;B[ef]
(;W[dh]C[are there better / more solid answers here? B7 surprised me so much i did not have a clue how to proceed. Then i reminded the "answer a cap with keima" proverb, so i chose d12

N: very strange move indeed. My first reaction was to cut immediately, but this leads to another joseki with white making an overplay. The second variation seems best to me to make the black move look bad. But also playin calmly as you do seems fine. It leaves a lot of aji in the black position.]
;B[qe];W[od];B[pg]C[N: now black seems a bit overconcentrated]
(;W[jc];B[hc]C[in hindsight, K17 was too far, but it felt too slow protecting at m16 here. I also felt B top position was too weak to invade immediately, so i thought i could leave it for now

could you please indicate alternatives for K17 and/or a proper timing to fix the defect around m16?
N: according to my feeling, you might even play closer, but your move is fine too. E14 seems strange like this.]
(;W[ck]C[Here i wanted to solidify my D12 group so i could attack B top left corner strongly if B would invade round m16

N: this is definetely too close to your other two stones, especially for an opening move. Your two stones are far from being in danger, so playing so safe is too slow.]
;B[kq]
(;W[fq]SQ[pj]C[i played here to invade 33 later, or build a group reducing B bottom prospectives. I did not like the result as B got sente to play Q4 at the end of this sequence. should i have played an extension from R3 first?

N: That would be my reaction, certainly as the marked stone is high i'm inclined to approach this.]
;B[hq]
(;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co]C[overplay from B but i did not see any need to start a fight here]
(;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn]C[N :And this is the easiest way to punish black.]
;B[do];W[bo];B[dn];W[cm]C[N: but now white feels quite low and overconcentrated on the left side.]
(;B[pp]C[i think B R6 would have put me in even more trouble, both extening and approaching, meanwhile forcing me to approach B strong group at the bottom. What other reasonable moves to you see for B here?

N: correct, this is a matter of direction of play. As black is high on the right side, he needs a move to finish his territory/position over there, also a stone on the fouth line aims at developping.]
;W[pq]
(;B[qp]C[in my eyes this contradicts Q4, so i hane

N: terrible];W[op];B[oo];W[no]C[i knew this was an overplay because of the p3 cut, but i trusted my opponent would not bother to read it all out

N: hmm deliberately playing an overplay shows bad style. Not sure it is an overplay though, it is more a chice]
;B[po]C[N: auw! terrible shape];W[np]C[later i found i left too much aji, but  i did not want to play O3 eitherbecause of the peep it leaves at N4.

should i have protected the cut differently, or could i also have covered the aji by spending another move later on?

N: seems possible, this puts more pressure on the black lump of stones and his influence. It is more choice you have to make between both you and your opponent having a good position or both having a lesser position.]
;B[nn]
(;W[ko]C[here i felt i could not afford to be enclosed in the corner. I played here to flatten B on the bottom and because i was looking for an opportunity to set F3 in motion, weakening the B bottom group

N: strange shape. It is of little use for you to build influence because of the strong black bottom. Therefore I think the most urgent place right now is the left side. I would be inclined to try the deep invasion.]
;B[mn];W[fr];B[fp];W[es];B[gp]
(;W[ol]C[another overplay.as follow-ups I was looking towards setting up the cut at p6, cutting through at R8 or running lightly via P10

N: you seem to be convinced you play a lot of overplays. This move allows a strong attack, but full of complications, not sure what the result would be
More imortant: if you count territories it is not necessary to  play this way. You might want to try to make some sabaki with attach and croscutts.]
(;B[ql]C[N: now you basically played a forcing move, meaning you can safely abandon this stone if necesarry.]
;W[oj]C[N: good, attach];B[pk]
(;W[pm]C[N: this seems more like an overplay, you start to become heavy]
;B[qm];W[rq]C[i played this to remove some of the p3 aji and to make a base for this group]
;B[rp]C[N: this last move looks too small];W[on];B[nr]C[i did not see this comming, and i also missed the was B found to connect in the game.]
(;W[nq];B[or];W[mr];B[lr];W[mq];B[ms];W[lo]
(;B[ok]C[N: Here and later, black plays moves that weaken his own stones, he basically forces you to attack his stones.]
;W[nl];B[ml];W[nk];B[mk];W[mj];B[oi];W[nj];B[jm]C[in the game i thought B was helpng me getting my o10 stones out, now it looks more like a leaning attack]
;W[lm];B[mm];W[km];B[kk];W[jl]
(;B[kl];W[jn];B[im];W[jp]
(;B[jq];W[pr]C[i saw a posibily to live and connect my stones in one move]

;W[ki]
(;B[lq];W[mo];B[ln];W[sp];B[ro];W[kh];B[kf];W[kn];B[ij];W[lk]
C[this tesuji got me back in the game. But it is clear to made i made mistakes earlier on. Would there have been better ways for me managing my 2 weak groups, or better ways for B to exploit them?

N: off course, you shouldn't have had two weak groups in the first place. After you lost eyespace and made a heavy center group, it looked quite bad for you, you needed mistakes by your opponent. Only thing you can do is wait for them and maybe give hime some bait ;-)]
;B[lc]
(;W[id]C[panic response. i wanted to secure top right corner but i felt i should B something to worry as well

N: First response is to check whether or not you should panic. Look at the balance of territory and power. To me it seems you are ahead and so you can afford to give your opponent something on top; the most important is you should avoid to play heavy.]
;B[hd]
(;W[qd]C[N: strange shift of place to play. This is not consequent with your previous move. Also I do not think this group is in immediate danger.]
;B[re]C[this dit not help me a lot. i have no clue how much damage my corner could take. Could i tenuki here?

N: s15 seems more useful then r16]
(;W[ig];B[if];W[pe];B[qf];W[nc];B[mb];W[nb];B[cd]C[very big, made me feel i should have played in that direction much earlier

N: I agree];W[be];B[bd]
(;W[gn]C[another overplay. I was looking to either enclosing the bottom an making it struggle to make 2 eyes, cutting of J7 and J10 making central moyo and expanding my borrom. in the end, this move did neither. Should i have started on E7 with G6 as possible follow-up?

counting this position i estimate 30 points on the left for W + 6, 9, 11 in lower right corner, top corner and center respectively
 = 56
for B, 25 on the right, 40 at the top, so B is leading by about 10 points. So i should make 10 points more in the center than B
 = 65

With this count in mind i think i should play f8, threatening to pull out K8 (thus capturing j10 and L8) and setting up g6.

The more i stare at this position, the clearer it becomes to me that i have now idea how to execute the plan of 'making 10 points more than B in the center'

N: look at the variation, i think this is the best and could be enough (taken komi into account)
The variation you played in the game looks damaging. If you wanted to end up with more points, it is better to focus on this kind of sequences then to think you must play a very high level endgame.]
;B[fl];W[gm];B[il];W[jk];B[jj];W[ll];B[hn];W[kg]C[i wanted to force B to capture K17 on a small scale, and destroy potential territory around N14. What are other reasonable plans in this position? When counting i felt behind a little]
;B[lf]C[from here some of hte moves have been interchanged, the moves serve mainly to indicate who got which points and the fimal score.

I got some big endgame points, and so did my opponent. Could you indicate any big move that either me or my opponent failed to play? The game ended closely, so i think i should improve my endgame some more, and i like endgame a lot, because it has not so much variations to read.

N: This becomes a bit hard to comment, I included one variation as an idea and as last variation/comment.]
