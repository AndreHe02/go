C[This game was between myself (8k before the game) and Metal4Ever (5k). It was an even game, I played black. There were some risky situations, and even a point fairly early on at which I nearly considered resigning (you'll probably see why). The end result was that I won by 0.5. With any luck, you'll be able to help me pinpoint bad plays, and reasons behind better plays. Thanks!

** My comments are marked like this.  I think the biggest problems occur on the right side (and the corner) where a few key plays were ignored, and a few others were overplays.  Actually, the upper right corner problems were a side effect of the problems on the right side.  Try to keep an eye on your group safety.  It's more important than attacking your opponent.  
** There are some other comments in the game about some shape, the false ko fight, and the left side moyo that wasn't invaded.  I hope those comments along with those about the right side help avoid future pitfalls.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[qk];W[po]C[I've never known any particularly good responses to this kakari against the low chinese. I think the one I played worked decently, though I also considered plays such as R4 and R5.


** Your play looks good to me.];B[np];W[pl];B[oo]C[** This seems like an awkward shape for you.  It remains awkward through most of the game.]
;W[pp];B[qq]C[** Your shape here is still not good.  After white gets strong, you end up playing N3 to help "fix it", and then end up needing to play O6 to fix it again  Try to find other non-contact plays to pressure white.  In the end, I don't think P5 accomplished much of anything.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[pk];B[qn]C[** should white save those two stones?  If yes, good play, if not, you'll likely lose your two black stones on the side (or get them endangered)]
;W[pn];B[rm]C[** Consider R8 instead...  Stealing white's base and building your won.]

[ng][rg]C[I felt that I needed to play on top in response to this, but at the same time I didn't want to leave my side group so vulnerable. Thoughts on this, or ideas?

** I think supporting the side group is more urgent than the corner.  That said, there may be a few moves you can do in sente that can support either group (marked points).  If you use one, to support one group, I'd recommend the next move to support the other.  S16 may be the best]
;B[pj];W[lc];B[ld];W[mc];B[kd]C[This play may have been a little overzealous..

** Yes, it's an overplay :(];W[md];B[ec]C[** I'm starting to get very uncomfortable with your position.  I don't yet feel like the right side is secure, the upper right corner is weak, you have two floating stones, and are potentially starting a new group.  A pincer of E17 *will* hurt.  The lower right seems to be massively in your favor, especially with another stone down there... both to threaten full enclosure of white and to stop a counter attack against your right stones.  On the right, I like P10.  Also, L17 is looks like enough of a threat against the 3 white stones, but also helping to ensure the death of your corner (already likely)]

;W[en]C[I don't know any joseki that involve E6 here, so I went back to the needy corner. :S

** I don't either, E6 feels atypical.  You don't really need to fear it, but it is setting up the left side to be big.]
;B[qb];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[qc];W[rd]C[This play troubled me, so I decided to again leave the corner alone until I had a better plan.]
;B[mq];W[oj];B[iq]C[** eek!  P10 is sente.  See variations]

;W[rg];B[ri];W[qd];B[gf]C[I felt safe on the right at this point, but only because I made a reading error... white capitalizes.]
;W[sk];B[sh];W[sj];B[sg];W[se];B[si];W[sk];B[sn]C[Ko fight anyone? I think white's response ought to have been S6, but I at least appreciated the bait being taken.


** Umm... no.  It's a ko fight for a false eye.  White should S4]
;W[sm];B[qe];W[pe];B[sl];W[rg]C[This, I think, is the only reason I came out ok. The response gave me a good position.]

;W[nk];B[cr]C[** Too small.  White has some majore moyos starting.  A play in the middle of the left side is very big.  White's 5th line stones won't help stop your invasion... The E6 stone you didn't know how to handle won't end up being all that useful for white.]

** You have some vulnerability (see variation).  A move like F8 may be timely, but K8 is probably the correct immediate response]
