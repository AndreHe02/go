C[Overall tips: Don't shy away from fights. Take advantage of openings in your opponents formations and put pressure on them. Leave it up to them to figure out how to deal with your invasions. Your play is generally too mild and conservative, and often inefficient (though the same can be said about white).]

There is nothing wrong with blacks opening so far. It's not like he has done badly. The thing is that it feels a bit dead. There's no fighting going on.]

This white move is wrong direction and not that big. Blacks follow up move is even worse.]

(;B[lm]C[Daddeldu [2k\]: but C7 is very strong on the other side. Especially because of your middle strength

What does this do? Pretty much nothing. Even if white encloses black, she won't get points outside.
