C[I hope that some of my comments are helpful, if only to give you some idea of what I was thinking during the game.

*** My name is Joerg, about 4k.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]
(;W[qo]LB[qo:A][po:B]C[W: Maybe B would have been better?

B: Q5 doesn't look bad. R5 lets black muscle white's group out of the center.

*** I think R5 is fine. Your  variation after Q5 looks good for white, but black may choose another joseki (e.g. R7), see variation]
;B[oo]C[*** I believe that this is not the best move for Black. It neither aggressive enough nor defending. O4 would be adequate for protecting the bottom side territory. P5 leaves room for later trouble (white N4). A pincer is best suited here (e.g. R8)]
;W[qq];B[pp];W[qp]
(;B[qk]C[B: I'm not sure I like this move. White's group isn't really threatened by this. The star point is probably better, or even an approach on the upper left corner.

**** The natural move for black would have been P7 and then white R8, see variation. This more in accordance with the strategy of P5.]
;W[hq]C[B: I think an invasion here is difficult for white. It might be better to play near the star point at the top or to approach black's upper right corner.

**** I agree. The invasion here is (at least) too early. White has no support for this. I would just calmy play the obvious opening points that have not yet been taken, like K16 or O17. More aggressive could be R14.]
;B[jq]C[**** K2 is probably better.]
(;W[hp]C[**** not good move. White stones H3/H4 are heavy. It will be difficult to rescue them. They will be a burden. H4 is better, see variation.]
;B[fm]C[**** good];W[fr];B[gr];W[er];B[gq]C[B: As black, I was happy with the result on the bottom to this point.

*** black can be satisfied, indeed.];W[nc]C[*** just before it is too late. Good move.]
(;B[qc]LB[pf:B][qc:A]C[The move at R17 probably isn't great for black. Q14 is probably preferable with the low stone at R9.

**** exactly. The outcome of your variation is fine for black. This looks timid.]
;W[ne]C[**** This looks strange to me. White should either make a base with an extension along the top side (e.g. L17, L16 or K16) or "invade" at R14. O15 is normally played if white has no eye-space along the side or wants to seperate hostile groups. Both is not the case here.]
(;B[pf]TR[pg]C[W: I was surprised by this short move. A 2-space-extension at Q13 would have been possible.

**** no, I think that this would be too lose. Black could think of P14, which would attack and enlarge the right side territory to the 5th line.]
;W[jd]C[Locallly, this seems like a good result for white

**** not really. Black has basically secure 4th line territory on the upper right side. White is far from having secure territory.]
(;B[df]C[B: Maybe O13 is a better move for black. White gets the point later and it flattens out black's moyo even more.

*** certainly, O13 is a hot spot for both sides. But approaching the lonely corner stone D16 is at least as urgent, I guess. Strategically this was a good choice. However I would have preferred C14, becasue the threat of an invasion on C17 is higher and it is easier to stabilize for black on the left side.

nice variation...];W[fd]C[*** natural move. good]
(;B[cj]C[***** what is black's strategy here?];W[ng]
(;B[ff]C[**** looks like a mistake. White's last move O13 should not be ignored.]
(;W[he]C[***** too timid.];B[hg]C[**** good move. The exchange white H15 against black H13 is obviouly good for black.]
;W[jg]C[**** too passive.];B[ih];W[jh];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[kj]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[kl];W[ll];B[km];W[dl]C[**** black has many cutting points and an open base. Not too comfortable.]
;B[ek]C[**** E9 is the obvious reaction. So maybe D8 is not as good as it may look like.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[el];B[fl]C[**** this sequence was not good for white. Black secures its group whereas white has now destroyed all possible further means to create trouble for black here]
(;W[ph]C[B: I think this it a powerful move for white because it puts pressure on black's three stones in the corner and leaves R9 looking lonely.

*** yes, it should have been played much earlier. Now white can even go deeper (R12)]
;B[lm]C[*** wrong judgement by black. The move is locally very valueable. However leaving the situation after white Q12 as is, means losing too much. White can drive a splitting attack now, as the upper right cornder is not yet secure. see variation]
(;W[nl]C[**** White should attack the upper right corner first. To answer blacks move makes it sente and awards black unnecessarily.]
;B[qm]C[**** black must secure the top right with priority. Then there are more points to gain (possobly in sente) in the upper left.]
;W[pn]C[**** yes, definitely.];B[rn]
(;W[ro]C[**** see variation];B[rh]C[*** can this work? White should have played here when he had his chance instead if O8.]
;W[cf]C[B: Looking at black's 3,3 invasion later, it may be better for white to play in the corner instead of attacking. It's gote but it looks like a big point.

*** I would have play this earlier];B[cg];W[ce];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[db];W[eb]
(;B[bd]
(;W[cd];B[bb];W[be];B[ac]C[B: Black loses sente but the success of the corner invasion looks big.
W: I 've got the feeling, the defense totally messed up here as Black's corner get that big.


**** yes, blacks invasion should not be that successful.(see variation)]
;W[bg];B[ch];W[mm];B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W[on]C[**** what does this move serve? white should exploit the gaps between S12 and Q14 and S12 and R9.]
;B[qg]C[**** pitiful for white.];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[pl]C[B: Black's move doesn't really do much here....

**** true.];W[mo]
(;B[ln]LB[mp:B][ln:A]C[B: I didn't see the cut here, and my response very nearly cost me the game. N4 is probably better, but I think I was concerned with fighting a disadvantageous ko.

*** your concern was right. (see my variation on the ko fight). But there is no need to start a ko fight after N4 (see variation)]
;W[mp];B[nq];W[np];B[pr];W[op]
(;B[po]C[**** losing move, see variation];W[oq];B[or]C[**** obviously this cannot work. Why continue?]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rr];W[qr];B[qs];W[ns]C[W: Here I thought, I would win :-)
B: White has obliterated black's moyo at the bottom, gained a huge corner, and is way ahead at this point.

***** obviously];B[ok];W[oj];B[nb]C[W: I've read this as overplay and decided to cut that stone off from the corner.
I could prevent Black from making 2 eyes, but did not think he could connect to the stones near the center.

B: I can't decide whether O18 is a bad move or not, but at his point I was desperate for any advantage I could get.

*** it is overplay, but black must overplay anywhere, there is no other chance to win.]
(;W[oc]LB[oc:A][mc:D][ob:B][mb:C]C[B: I was hoping for a hane move on either side of O18. I'm not sure white can cut off black's stone from the corner altogether by moving at P17. For some reason I like N17 better.]
(;B[lb]LB[ob:B][lb:A]C[B: This is probably too aggressive. Black would might do better by just playing at P18, but I felt I needed something more drastic to have any hope at making a comeback.

**** your variation P18 is playable, M19 is the wrong direction. There is no way to make eyes here]
