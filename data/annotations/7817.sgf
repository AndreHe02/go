C[Dear Reviewer,
Thanks for your help. I played White in this game and lost - please guide me to understand why.

I put some specific questions inside, but all comments and advises are welcome.

Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[fd]C[CG: This move looks a bit strange to me. If you don't mind black getting a secure posion on the left, attaching at C15 gets more territory. Actually, C15 is the move played most often by pros in this position.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[jd]C[[A\] Is this OK for Black? Joskei is C11.

CG: No, this is not ok - black should extend to C12 (or C11).]
;W[cg]C[[A\] Is this response OK? I could not launch a satisfactory attack in next steps.

CG: This move looks ok. Of course you can't expect to kill black.]
;B[fe]
(;W[ge]CR[cg]SQ[jd]C[CG: This looks dubious, especially as you planned to connect next.
The marked black stone reduces the value of the triangled stone, and the black extension to F14 harms your stone on the left.

What about just playing E13 or C10?];B[ff];W[gd];B[gf];W[ie]
;B[je];W[hf];B[hg];W[ig];B[hh];W[fh]C[CG: Hm, is this a kikashi or an overplay? I'm afraid it's the latter - the following moves look all natural, but if black can easily capture F12, it's clearly a bad move.
 Maybe just C10 would be better.];B[eh]C[CG: Good counter!]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[dh]C[CG: This hurts! Pushing from behind.];B[ei]
;W[di];B[ef];W[dg];B[dj];W[ej];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[dk];B[cj]
;W[ck];B[bi];W[bk];B[bg];W[bf];B[bh];W[cf]C[[A\] I was satisfied with capturing the Black group - do you agree?

CG: Yes, that would be ok. But can you capture it?

But even if you can capture black you should keep in mind that black has some really big ko threats now.]
;B[af]C[CG: Black is trying hard ...];W[be];B[bd];W[ae];B[bj]
(;W[ag]C[CG: This is only a thousand year ko. Hane at B11 is slightly better as it allows you to chose between a thousand year ko and a direct ko which you capture first.]
(;B[ce];W[aj];B[ad]
(;W[ci]C[CG: Dangerous! Now black can get a favourable ko.]
(;B[df]C[CG: ... but now black misses his chance! The result should be a ko.]
;W[ai];B[cq]C[[A\] This reduced my territory significantly, did I play right?

CG: Of course this reduces your territory ...];W[cp]C[CG: I'm not sure which blocking is better. This one yields more territory but white gets over-concentrated.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq]
(;W[cn]C[[A\] Losing sente here is painful for White

CG: Well, the invation at 3-3 is usually sente for black. Being very strong on the left, you can even consider to take sente - the cut is not small, but only endgame.]
;B[iq]C[CG: Looks too close to white's thickness - Q14 is more urgent.]
;W[gr]C[CG: Why the heck do you answer here? The kakaris at R14 or R6 are MUCH  more important!]
;B[io]LB[io:B][gr:A]C[[A\] I regarded this as a critical point. What should White do now?

CG: Well, what happens here? Black wants to reduce your thickness which you wouldn't want to use to build territory anyway. 
So don't panic, just play on normally.
Of course, the exchange white A - black B is very bad for white, but that alone should not lose the game.]
;W[jp]C[CG: Well, that's a REALLY bad move. What were you thinking? 
Did you think you were strong enough to attack the black stones (which would have been a misperception) or were you just panicking?

I think if you look again at this peep now, you see that it is a bad move. If not, try again tomorrow or read Kageyama's "Lesson in the Fundamentals of Go" (which is really a good idea to do once a year until you are shodan).]
;B[ip];W[nq];B[kr];W[lp]C[CG: This is also a little bit strange. Just play O5 or even R6 and forget about the "kikashi" K4.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[jq];B[jr]
(;W[hr]C[CG: Aji-keshi of the worst kind!!!
If you just decend (see variation) you threaten to kill the corner or cut.

Even leaving the ko threat is better than the peep in bad shape!]

CG: My feeling is that black can easily escape to one of the marked stones. That's one reason why N13 was bad.]

C[[A\] Trying to do do something here, but the Black group is already dafe. Black is leading by comfortable margin. What went wrong?

CG: Apart from many "small" mistakes like H2, the main reason is that black managed to secure the whole top right. 
There you should blame moves like N13 (more or less a pass). 
At 168 you may still have had a chance to live on the right side.]
