AB[pd][dp][pp]C[>Hello! Im playing black here, and loss this game by 10,5 points. Im not really >sure, what i schould do better. So any comments and advices are welcome.

>Thank you!

Sirkut> Hi kostuek.  Thank you for submitting your game.  I'm sorry for the delay in getting this review to you.  I hope you find it helpful.  I'll precede all my comments with 'Sirkut>']
;W[dd];B[fd];W[cf];B[dc]C[>Maybe just K16 or Q10 or something like this instead?

Sirkut> This looks good and looks like a fairly common fuseki to me.]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[>Again.. R14 better?

Sirkut> No, I think you had the right idea, but your choice invites a pincer at J17.  I'd recommend K17 or J17 instead.  Just let white make a small weak base if he wants.  In exchange you'll have a larger stronger base and sente.  See variation.]
;W[qf]
(;B[oe]C[Sirkut> It is much too early to start pushing into the center.  As you'll see later in the game, it's also not a good idea to leave the 3,3 point unprotected.  This is a complicated position to be in.  Look at the variations for a few suggestions.]
;W[qn];B[np];W[rp];B[qq];W[pj];B[qh]TR[cj][jq]C[>This one looks strange for me...

Sirkut> I agree. ;)  It's too early to invade IMO.  I think K3 or C10 would have been more appropriate.  C10 I like better because it has three strong corners to push against and is farthest away from other clusters of black, yet still close enough to have something to run to.]
;W[cn];B[oh]TR[jc][oc][ld][cj][cl][cp][fp][jq]C[Sirkut> At this point there are much larger positions to worry about.  I've marked a few.  It is very tempting to take particular stone and run with it, but you have to fight that urge.  Instead, each move look for the biggest move - first look for biggest by amount of territory gained, then look for the positions that will get you the most influence.]

[mm][pm][bn][bq]SQ[eq][gq]C[>Wrong direction? somthing like D12 better maybe?

Sirkut> I like this move better than D12 because when you're in the center you have to think about making circles around the territory you want.  J12 would be a natural next move.  However there are some better moves on the board.  B3 significantly hurts white and puts pressure on E3 and G3 while leaving a good follow-up move of B6.  In a variety of combinations the positions of N7, Q7 and R9 look like they could have a lot of potential.  Also the stone at H9 needs protection because otherwise white can use it as a pivot to push deep into the center.]

[rk][ql][dm][bq]C[>K12?

Sirkut> K12 would have been a little better, but look at the size of the marked positions.  R8 could have been particularly interesting because you might have gotten something by pushing in whichever direction white didn't protect.]

C[> Im not sure this one is necessary...

Sirkut> Don't think so.  Rarely needed in a center shape (as opposed to one on the border).  I'd have waited until a few more outside liberties were taken and it was more obvious.]
;W[ni]C[Sirkut> Here you can ignore white's fake threat and instead take sente and gain a few points here.  The end game is all about who can gain a point here and there by forcing the opponents hand.]

[ss]C[Sirkut> This was a very good game.  Thank you for sharing it.  The few tips that I'd suggest thinking about are:
1) Always focus on the whole board and finding the biggest move, for each and every stone.
2) Each move try and some tangible about of territory from a part of the board where your opponent has the least amount of influence.
3) Don't be afraid to experiment.  Don't go looking for a fight, but instead look for positions that could have several, or more different outcomes.  Then look for positions that have move possible possitive outcomes for you than for your opponent.  Then see how you can use other 'throw away' stones to influence which outcome happens!

Again, thanks for the game and I appologize for the delay.  If you have any questions about the review, please contact me at sirkut001@gmail.com.  Best of luck!]
