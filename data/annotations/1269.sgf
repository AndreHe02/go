AB[pd][dp][dd]C[Hello, My name is Otso Alanko and I am a shodan from Finland. This review was asked by Cristiano Garbarini, who is playing white in the game. I will, however, comment on both players' moves, as I find it easier and more helpful.

Ok, to the game.];W[pp]C[This is a 3 stones handicap game. This sort of small handicap means that neither player needs to try any special handicap strategies. Normal moves are ok.]

(;B[ck]LB[dj:a]C[Black 2: Normal move would be at 'a', forming the very powerful sanrensei formation.

See var 2];W[qf]C[White 3: Normal];B[nd]LB[nc:a]C[Black 4: Good

Another good choice was 'a', to keep sente.];W[pj];B[ic]C[Black completes his formation.

Now white must think what to do. If he just tries enlarge his own framework, black will surely keep ahead, because of his 3 handicap stones.]
;W[cf]C[White 7: Invasion, Very good

This is the right place to play as it is the largest gap in black's formation. This also shows why black's play at c9 was not very good, white had an easy time choosing where to invade.

Next move is very difficult.
I will show some variations.]
(;B[ch]C[Black 8: So it seems that this move, which is a pincer and extension at the same time is quite a good move.

What should white do then? Actually, white has nothing to be afraid of.   As this is a rather interesting situation. I will again show some variations  to illustrate the possibilities.]

(;W[ef]C[White 9: Not good

This is a joseki in some situations, but here it is wrong. Check variations from one move back for suggestions.

The real problem with this move comes a few moves later.];B[fd]
C[
Black 10: Good

Now white would like to play at d11, to make a wall facing the center, but black's stone at c9 spoils the chance.   Check the variation for normal joseki moves.]

(;W[gf]C[These white stones here are now just running out, they are not really not doing anything.]
;B[cd]C[Black 12: Very nice

Black takes area and keeps white's stones weak.

Black is clearly doing better now, so white has to think what to do.]
;W[fq]LB[he:a][fi:b]C[White 13: This is good.

Although the white's stones at the upper left are still weak, running more would ensure black's victory.

Later black can choose how to attack the white stones. Good attacking points are 'a' for making upper side safer and 'b' for building the left side.]
;B[nq]C[Black 14: fancy

By ignoring white's last move black seeks complications.];W[lq]
LB[jq:a]C[White 15: Good

A pincer puts black in a difficult situation.

At 'a' is another option, rather similar.];B[no]C[It seems both players like to jump out in this situation. I can't say really that this is totally bad here, but there are other options too.]
;W[pn]LB[kp:a][ip:b]C[Next black move is difficult.   See the variations 2 and 3.]

(;B[pr]LB[qq:a]C[Black 18: Mistake, losing options (or 'aji' as japanese say)

This move loses the possibility to later take the whole corner by playing at a.]
;W[qq]LB[ip:a]C[White 19: Could also think about playing right away at 'a' (j4).]
;B[qr]C[Black 20: Mistake again, as white's next move demonstrates. This move is simply too slow.]
;W[ip]LB[rq:a][rp:b][rr:c]C[White 21: Very good!

White patches all problems here.

Black should also settle his stones right away with the combination of black 'a' - white 'b' - black 'c'.]
;B[dq]LB[rr:a]C[Black 22: Settling the black stones is more important.

White should play at 'a' right away. That way both players would have one weak group.]
;W[fi]LB[cn:a][lc:b]C[White 23: Making shape.

This is nice move  to take away white's only weak group. After this invasions for example at 'a' and 'b' become much easier.

However I'd still harass the black stones in the lower right first to see what happens.]
;B[ol]LB[nn:a]C[Black 24: I don't understand this.

Black is asking white to make territory and there is even the frightening possibility that white just cuts black 24 off at 'a' (see var).   Black should settle these stone by taking the corner with the sequence suggested earlier.]

(;W[ql]LB[nn:a]C[Should have been at 'a'.];B[nm]LB[qc:a][cn:b]
[lc:c]C[Ok, there is some aji left in white's right side, but still, these black stones here are rather pointless.

White's next move:

White has no weak groups now so should consider an invasion.   Points 'a', 'b' and 'c' came to my mind first.]
;W[qc]LB[rd:a]C[White 27: Very nice.

I also like this invasion point best. A black move at 'a' would have made a very big difference in areas.]
;B[qd]LB[rd:a]C[The next white move should be at 'a', see the variations.]

(;W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb]LB[dm:a]
C[The corner sequence:
By playing this way white gets shut in very tightly and black gets sente. Black should be satisfied.

The middle game is starting, counting the areas roughly, it seems that black has kept his advantage from the 3 handicap stones.

Black's top is bigger than white's right. Black's left is bigger than than white's bottom.

See variations for suggestions where should black play the next.

I personally prefer 'a'.]
(;B[sg]LB[cn:a]C[Black 38: Hmm, sorry to say, but this is probably the worst move in the game this far. Maybe it is a mouse slip?

White gets his chance, as suggested, black was leading, so white should think about something interesting.

I suggest invading at 'a', the upper side is not easy to take in one move.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[gb]C[White 41: This is too deep];B[gc]C[Black 42: Good]
;W[ec];B[ed];W[cb]C[Interesting life and death.

See var 2]
(;B[bb]C[Might a tesuji, if followed correctly];W[bc];B[db]
;W[ba];B[cc];W[ab]LB[dm:a]C[Ok, white took some of black's corner. Time to play at 'a'.]
;B[bd]C[Black 52: Again bad, this doesn't take any points, nor is it sente.]
;W[eb]C[White 53: Saving these stone is small.];B[dc];W[da]
;B[hb]C[Black 56: Both players fail to look at the whole board.]
;W[if];B[je];W[cn]C[White 59: Finally!];B[dm]C[See var for white.]

(;W[bp]LB[dn:a]C[Black should block at 'a' right away to keep white confined.]
;B[bq];W[co]LB[eo:a]C[White 63: Strange shape, should play at 'a']
;B[bm]C[This looks like black is going for kill. Hard for white.]
;W[en];B[fp];W[eo];B[gq];W[gp]C[Nice movement from white.];B[fr]
;W[fo]C[Black should eat so as not to give white another sente atari.]
;B[ep];W[hq];B[gr];W[go];B[fk]C[White's 2 invasions have been rather succesful, game is closer.]
;W[gl]LB[gk:a][kn:b]C[Black should push at 'a' or play around 'b'.]
;B[fj];W[ei]C[Good move from white, black's shape is bad.];B[dj]
;W[ln];B[ll];W[hj];B[jl]C[There is little territory in the center.]
;W[dh];B[bh];W[mc];B[nc];W[qh]LB[rq:a]C[Good move, removes lots of aji from the right.

The biggest move is at 'a'.];B[of];W[me];B[ne];W[lg];B[mf];W[lf]
;B[le];W[ke];B[ld];W[kd];B[kc];W[jf];B[jd];W[kf]LB[rq:a]C[White gained little and lost sente.

Biggest play is at 'a'.

The endgame has started.

;W[hs];B[fc]LB[er:a]C[Ok, the game was very close before this. Should be at 'a'.]
;W[er]C[Both players made some mistakes at fighting. but that is not too important.

Rather, both players made several small moves on the edge, when much bigger plays were still there.

You should always look at the whole board after every move. This will help your game tremendously.]
;B[eq]C[White's choice of joseki in upper left corner was very bad. Joseki should be chosen according to situation, or better yet not thought about at all.

That gave black the lead, which lasted nearly to the end. Black played some strange moves, especially at t13, but the lead was still very big.

White gave away some chances, for example when black played at p8, but so did black.

Both players played rather good shape, which is always nice to see.]
;W[es]C[Overall this was a good game, and interesting to comment.]
;B[fq];W[ds]C[I hope my comments were helpful and wish you both nice time with go.
