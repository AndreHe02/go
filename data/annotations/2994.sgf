GC[This is my first serious 19x19 game against a Handicap.
o what is the best general strategy when playing against 2 Handicap,
  especially in the opening?
o where are the neuralgic points in my game? Where could I have made
  a big move when playing a lukewarm one or where did I overplay when a
  silent move would have given me more profit?
o Are there any mistakes I make over and over again?

any criticism and propositions welcome..]

AB[pd][dp]C[[Rich\] 
Hi Peter,

Interesting game, and quite close scores at the end. 

You make quite good shape, it's the direction and timing that could be sharper, I think; also the meanings of some set moves. I'll comment as we go and summarise at the end.]
;W[pp]C[pn> I guess it's no bad idea to claim at least one corner

[Rich\] - It's a very good idea.];B[dd]LB[qq:A][nq:B][jq:C]
[fq:E][qj:D]C[pn> should I secure my corner with a move like A or B, or
pn> should I extend to C or D or attack (as I did) at E?

pn> I feel that it's too early for a 3-3 point Attack...

[Rich\] - As white in a handicap game, you have to catch up - this means keeping the initiative. Playing at A or B is slow and A-D all give the initiative to black. E is great.

If you want to play halfway along the sides to prevent black from getting three parallel star points and building a moyo, then midway between the black stones on the third line would be usual. However, in a handicap game the two points at C10 and K17 are miai; if white plays one, black plays the other. See var. 

It's *definitely,*, *definitely* too early for a 3-3 invasion. Save this for when you have groups around that can negate the value of the thickness black will build up. See corner invasion var. for explanation.]

(;W[fq];B[cn]LB[jq:B][jp:A][fo:C][dj:D][qf:E]TR[fq]C[pn> what is the best follow up move for W?
pn> should W secure his marked stone and if so, how - or
pn> should W further attack?

[Rich\] - well, a simple way to secure the stone would be D2: either he defends or you grab the corner - see var. 

This combines attacking and securing your stone. Always try to find moves that do more than one job - it's much more efficient.]

(;W[jp];B[nq]
(;W[lq]C[[Rich\] - this pincer to a low approach is often an invitation to invade the corner. If that happens, white will have a lot of stones and a strong group, but rather densely packed in the lower half. See var.]
;B[qn]C[[Rich\] - good pincer for black.]
(;W[qq]C[[Rich\] - I think this is the weakest move white makes in the game. I doesn't defend, it doesn't attack, it doesn't make territory.

In this position, either move out diagonally to split the opponent's stones apart, or attach to the strong stone to capture the weak. See vars. given your later play, playing either of these, you would have won.]
;B[no];W[pf];B[qf];W[qg];B[qe]
(;W[ne]C[[Rich\] - normally here, white plays as var.];B[nd]
;W[pe]C[[Rich\] -  this is a heavy move, and encourages black to make himself even more secure. At the same time, it doesn't do too much for you.]
;B[qc];W[fc];B[cf]
(;W[jc]C[[Rich\] - I think in this position I would have played as the variation. This group is weak and has black groups either side; that means you'll have to lose the initiative at some point to defend it.]
;B[lc]LB[qk:C][je:A][fe:B]C[pn> should I enforce my stones at the upper edge with moves like
pn> A or B or was it a good Idea to launch a new attack at C?

[Rich\] - C was early. White's top group has a weak point at H17. Also, black can cut in the top right. For a move that keeps black back while settling your top group, how about make a play at D18 and then L16?]

(;W[qk]C[Rich\] - see vars. for other options.]
(;B[rl]LB[or:E][ro:D][pn:C][pm:B][rk:A]C[pn> maybe I should have gone towards the outside with something
pn> like B (I don't like C somehow)...
pn> or I should have tried to do something to enforce my corner,
pn> maybe D or E instead of playing A?

[Rich\] - You get good outside influence here anyway. C would have been a reasonable move to try and rescue the corner - I've put a few comments in your C var.

The point is, each stone should say something definite. 
A stone at A says that you want the territory above. A stone at C that you're going to fight to get the corner stones out. A stone at D or E that you want a fight for life in the corner (although it will probably lead to black getting influence and shutting you in).]

(;W[rk];B[rp];W[ol];B[po];W[lo]C[[Rich\] - Not an urgent point, and not as big as black's next play... once you have a position settled so that the opponent can't do serious damage with one play, look for the biggest points on the board.]
;B[cj]
(;W[fo]C[[Rich\] - Another move that doesn't threaten black much. Perhaps now would be a good time to play the 3-3 corner invasion... see var.]
;B[em];W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[cr];W[cs]C[[Rich\] - this is a small point, to be saved 'til the end of the game.]
;B[bs];W[ds];B[bq]LB[gm:A][ke:C][fe:B][cc:D]C[pn> It looks like it is more urgent to do something for the upper edge now
pn> instead of playin A....
pn> or maybe a 3-3 invasion at D??
pn>

[Rich\] - Your top group is too weak to invade the corner... see var.

Again, I'd suggest D18 to start with... see var.]
(;W[gm];B[ek];W[gk]C[[Rich\] - this does trade you more influence in the centre for some territory on black's side, but a general rule that trade is fair at the fourth line... black gets too much out of this and is happy to play along.]
;B[fi];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg];W[ee];B[de];W[fg];B[fh];W[gh]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[hi];W[ij]C[[Rich\] - This is a strange move. If you want to make territory with the lower group, attacking the lower right would be better.]

(;B[om]C[[Rich\] - white has a weak point on the top; see var.]
;W[ql];B[rm];W[qm];B[qp]
(;W[pm]C[[Rich\] - when fighting: connect when you can, cut when you can.
See var.];B[pn]LB[or:A]C[pn> I think it wouldn't have been a bad idea to save my corner now...
pn> something like A, maybe?]
(;W[nm];B[nn];W[on];B[oo];W[om];B[mn]
(;W[km]C[[Rich\] - This is just a little too far away; eventually the black group pushes through here and takes a lot away. See var.]
;B[lm];W[mm];B[ln];W[kn];B[lp];W[mp];B[mq]
(;W[kp]C[[Rich\] - you don't have to take this yet; it can't escape, and you can fight locally or play elsewhere. See var.]

;B[kf];W[ke];B[lf];W[mf];B[je];W[le];B[jd]LB[id:A][ic:B]C[pn> and again the ladder at A... although I think playing B

[Rich\] - In most cases, the tightest way to capture stones is usually the best. In this case, though, you're right.]

(;W[id];B[ie];W[he]C[[Rich\] - Another chance to have played at J17...]

[ca:B]C[pn> playing A was probably unneccessary, eh?
pn> I guess B would have been better?

[Rich\] - Yes, those two stones can't do much as long as black plays reasonable moves. Count the liberties: his B19 stones have three to your two.]

(;W[ad];B[ab];W[bd];B[be];W[ed]C[[Rich\] -This is very small. You can't be cut here, it only protects one point of yours, and most importantly of all it gives him the initiative.]
;B[dh]C[[Rich\] - fortunately, it's wasted defending where it needn't be defended. :)]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[nk];B[nl]LB[mr:B][lr:C][nj:A]C[pn> is A necessary?
pn> maybe something like B or C would have been better?

[Rich\] - In this case, not necessary. However, with the upper right edge not really secured, perhaps better safe than sorry, especially playing with time limits.

While learning go, playing good, solid slow moves is almost certainly better than playing bad fast ones.]

[of][nf][lf][kf][hf][gf][me][je][ie][ge][gd][fd][eb]C[[Rich\] - you made some nice plays in the game; just ended up with a few too many weak points and black had the chance to attack them. A few points in summary:

* Especially in a handicap game, white has to catch up with black. Always try to make moves that black has to respond to; keep the initiative, make black play your game. Conversely, playing black in a handicap game, always look for any opportunity to not respond to white's move. It's a struggle for initiative.

* Once a group is settled and there are no more urgent plays, look for the biggest points (like move 29/30). Similarly, don't play big points if there are urgent points to be played.

* In handicap games, the stronger player (white) should have the advantage in an even fight. When behind, make moves that will make things complicated and where you can use your skill advantage in reading and life and death (and playing handicap go as black, make things as simple as you can.)

*Finally, don't underestimate the value of influence! Early 3-3 invasions make the game harder later on. If you can build a good wall on the fourth line in exchange for giving your opponent territory on the third, it's worth doing.

Hope this helps!])
