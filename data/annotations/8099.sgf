AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi,

I'm playing black in this handicap game, and I feel I lost ground around move 54.
Could you please highlight my main errors ?

Thanks !

Hello!

I'm Kalle, I'll start my comments with "Kalle: " in the kifu.

In general I think you played well, but you have to pay more attention to attacking possibilities, direction and shapes. In this game white created many weak groups, but you didn't manage to attack them very effectively. Instead white captured one of your groups in a big way, which was a big loss. But still after that you had chances in the game, it was close fighting until the end. I hope you find my comments useful.]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[dh];B[ed];W[dd];B[de];W[ee]
(;B[fd]LB[dg:A]C[Kalle: The joseki move here is at A, see the variation. This move that you played leads to a difficult position, if white answers correctly. It seems white knew these josekis.]
;W[ef];B[bc];W[fb];B[gc]C[Kalle: This is the right move.];W[bb]
(;B[bh]LB[bd:A]C[Kalle: Normally you would play A first.];W[bi]
(;B[ch]C[Kalle: You could consider throwing the corner away, saving it will just give white an overwhelming thickness towards the center. See variation.]
;W[ci];B[dg];W[eg];B[eh];W[di];B[df];W[fh]C[Kalle: The white wall is very strong and makes the game easier for white. You get very few points by living.]
;B[nq]LB[bd:A]C[Kalle: Here white could play A, you should defend here if you want to save your group.]
(;W[ei];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[ec]
(;B[bf]LB[gb:A]C[Kalle: You should block first at A (see variation). It is painful to let white play there.]
(;W[gb];B[hc];W[hb];B[ic];W[cn]
(;B[fq]LB[dn:A][en:B]TR[ci][di][ei]C[Kalle: White wants to use his thickness (the marked stones) to build a moyo. You should attack his plan. Therefore attaching at A or the keima at B would be better here. (see variation).]
;W[hq]LB[en:A]C[Kalle: I think this is a mistake by white, he is not following his plan. He should play at A to build a moyo. That is also the vital point for you here.]
(;B[bp]LB[en:A]C[Kalle: This is passive, white could now jump to A.]
;W[qn]LB[kc:B][en:A]TR[gc][hc][ic][ed][fd]C[Kalle: White is throwing stones on the board, but they don't work together. A is still a huge point, but attacking on the right is also good.

You would also like to make an extension from your top stones (marked). They are quite vulnerable to a white attack around B. If white plays at B he is threatening to connect under to his top group, which is annoying.]
;B[qo]C[Kalle: Good.];W[pn]
(;B[qj]C[Kalle: It's hard to say, but maybe this could be one point closer to the white stones. I would play this on the fourth line so that it works better in the center fighting later. (See variation).]
;W[lq];B[no]C[Kalle: Good. You are now aiming to attack on both sides.]
;W[qq];B[ro]C[Kalle: This is correct.];W[oj];B[ph];W[qk]
(;B[pq]LB[rk:A]C[Kalle: This move is not necessary. If white starts doing something here he will just hurt his own groups outside, so you don't need to worry about this.

It is really urgent to answer white's previous move. The natural answer is at A.]
;W[pj];B[qi]C[Kalle: White gave you a really good shape.];W[pf]
LB[qf:A][og:C][nh:B][rk:D]TR[gc][hc][ic][ed][fd]C[Kalle: White is making a third weak group on the board, but it is not so straightforward to attack this stone because you also have a weak group on the top (the marked stones). You would like to be able to play an extension from these stones, when you have the chance.

Because of this, it may be best to settle the situation locally and not drive white out into the center. The attachment at A is good for this.

If you want to start a jumping fight, you can jump directly (B) or play kosumi (C).

The final option is to reinforce yourself locally before moving anywhere. You could play at D.]
(;B[qf];W[qe]LB[pe:A][qf:B]C[Kalle: In situations like this, you just have to cut at A. Only in very special cases you should draw back. If white gets to connect at A, your groups will be separated and they will suffer so much that it's better to accept some complications than to give white the connection.

I have included some variations about the cut and they all have some kind of complications, but I think you just have to accept that in this case. If you don't want to end up in complications, you should play something else than the attachment (B) in the first place.]
(;B[qg];W[pe]C[Kalle: This connection makes the game really difficult for you.]
;B[qc];W[nd];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[nh];W[nf];B[mi];W[mk]
(;B[lg]C[Kalle: This move should be played a little differently so that you can help your weak stones at the top.]
;W[ke]C[Kalle: Now the five stones at the top are almost captured so it is best to sacrifice them.]
(;B[jf]LB[jg:A]C[Kalle: This keima looks nice, but white is so strong around here that he can cut it quite easily. You could consider the jump at A.]
;W[kf]
(;B[jh]LB[kg:A]C[Kalle: Just block at A];W[kg];B[kh];W[jg];B[hh]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[hg]
(;B[jq]LB[ol:A]C[Kalle: This is a very big point, but I think you should start from A and see how the fight develops first. The group on the right is more valuable than this side.]
;W[jr]LB[ir:A][kr:B]C[Kalle: Normally you play now either A or B. See variation.]
(;B[iq]C[Kalle: This is considered bad style, because you are helping white to create the "hane at the head of two stones" -shape. In other words, you are losing your on own liberties this way. I think you should play one of the hanes.]
;W[ir];B[kq];W[kr];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[nr];B[or];W[jo]LB[hp:A]
C[Kalle: White can now play this move, because you don't have many liberties. You can play A, but then white takes away all the side territory. (see variation).]
(;B[ko]C[Kalle: This move is bad, it just gives white another forcing move. You should connect solidly instead, (See variation from the previous move)]
;W[ip];B[kk]LB[ol:A]C[Kalle: Good idea, but I think this should be at A. You have to take the shape away first from white, and then attack from the outside. You have thickness on both sides, so white has a hard time escaping.]
;W[kl]LB[jl:B][ll:A]C[Kalle: In this kind of situations you should normally play either A (cut) or B (block). You play the block when the cut doesn't work. I think you can cut in this position.]

[nl]C[Kalle: These three stones are not valuable anymore, you shouldn't answer here just because white threatens to squeeze you. You should play for example A, after that the connection at B is sente. Or you can connect at B straight, it's very big also.]
