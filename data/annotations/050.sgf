(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]VW[]C[Another review request. In this game I played W.
 I am mainly concerned with the opening.  I think I got behind in the opening
somewhere, but managed to overcome my opponent because I was tactically
better in general. I seem to have a lot of trouble with the opening, and
am often finding myself having to fight to regain ground lost early.  I think my opponents pincer in the lower right corner early on was bad,
but I think I bungled the lower left somehow.
 Anyway, I'm only concerned up until around move 56 or so.

Thanks, David.

Hi David, Sure, no problem. But let's make this the last game, ok? Not
because I don't like to analyse your games, but for both of us it's good
to see other people's games/analyses as well I think. This game contained
again some interesting teaching material. I hope I could shed some light
on the questions you might have had while you played the game.

Kind regards, Jan van der Steen.]PB[zaier]BR[7k*]PW[vlk]WR[6k*]DT[1995-04-12]

[0.5];B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[ep];B[pp];W[nq]L[de]C[Could also be on 'a', the traditional big move because it prevents a shimari
for black.];B[lq];W[qq]
(;B[qp]L[qj][pq]C[Wrong direction because there is no black extension around 'a'. Correct
here is 'b', see variation.];W[pq]N[The game];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[pj]C[Good, this move largely reduces the effectiviness of the black wall.]
;B[pl]L[pg][pn]M[pj]C[This is hard to play since it looks so small. More positive would be 'a'
for example, trying to use the wall to attack the marked white stone.
However, white will occupy 'b' (after 'a') and thus striking the black
vital point. So white won't do bad in this fight.];W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd]
;W[df];B[fc];W[cj];B[gq]L[lr][cn]C[The lower side is not valuable because white can play 'a'. Black is open
there. A better point might thus be 'b'.]
(;W[er]L[cq][fo]C[This is the fighting approach, played when both sides are strong. In this
case however, the bottom is under black's control, so more usual would
be either 'a' (variation B) or 'b' (variation C) for white in this position.]
;B[dn]N[The game];W[fo]L[ip]C[Usually this move would require black to protect around 'a', enabling
white to play as in the variation.]
(;B[cr]M[fo][gq]N[The game]C[The difference in this position from the usual joseki pattern is that
white doesn't have a severe follow-up of the marked stone to attack the
marked black stone.
 Thus, black's move: taking the opponents's base while creating a base
for himself is a very good move here.];W[hp]L[iq][gr]M[gq]C[Good, the usual way to move these stones and also good enough in this
case.
 But, just curious: did you consider 'a' as well? That would also be worth
considering (maybe next time). White 'a' attacks the marked stone and
aims at the underneath connection at 'b'.];B[gp];W[go];B[hq];W[iq]L[ip]
[jp][kq][im]C[This makes things too easy for black. He can capture the marked stone
now. Better is to stretch with 'a', black [j3\], white 'b', black 'c',
white 'd' (to give shape and escape from the battle scene).];B[ip];W[ho]
;B[jq];W[cm]L[cn][cl][co]C[Not good since black's answer at 'a' is too obvious. A better move would
have been 'b', threatening 'c' next.];B[cn];W[jc]M[fc]L[nc]C[Not good since black is very strong on the left (the marked stone). The
best white can do in the upper-right corner is making a shimari with 'a'.]
;B[qf];W[qh]L[re]M[pj][qf]C[I agree that this is the keypoint for both marked groups to make eye shape.
But when black would invade (3,3) now the shape would become inefficient
(see variation). The usual move (considering the presence of white [k17\])
is 'a' (also see variation).]
(;B[pg]L[of]N[The game]C[This move "doesn't exist". Black should either attack with the normal
move at 'a', or play san-san (3,3). The reason that the played move is
not so good is that it stresses the attack too much while not having the
same impact on the corner as 'a' would have.];W[qd]M[pg][qf]L[ph][ql]
C[Shape-wise there is only one move: 'a'. This would give the marked stones
bad shape, while giving the white stones good shape (white 'b' next would
live conveniently).];B[mc]L[ph]C[Impatient, better continue the attack with 'a'.]
;W[nd]C[Looks ok, seperating the two black groups.];B[ld]L[md][me]
[kd][ne][jd]C[Again bad shape, usually running with kosumi (diagonal connection) is
considered bad. Black 'a' is usual instead. White 'b', black 'c' could
follow. At that point black can either look forward to the cut at 'd'
or the big move at 'e'.];W[oh]L[ph][ng][pi]C[Also bad shape, giving black the option to push through at 'a'. The usual
attacking move is 'b', black 'a', white 'c'.];B[og]L[ph][pi][nf]
C[Slightly clumpsy. Better would be: black 'a', white 'b', black 'c'.];W
[nh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mf];W[me]C[Interesting move!]
(;B[ne]L[le][nf][lf]C[The only move when considering shape is 'a'. After white 'b' (of course)
and black 'c' this will lead to some severe fighting with lots of variations
(see variation).];W[lf]N[The game]C[This move really hurts black. The game is virtually over like this.]
;B[nf];W[le]C[Black has two weak groups. Actually, it doesn't matter whether these groups
live or die. White will have a decisive advantage anyway.
