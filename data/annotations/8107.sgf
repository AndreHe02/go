AB[pp][dp][pj][dj][pd][dd]C[gdc:

 I recognize some obvious tactical mistakes (commented in the file). My biggest question is about how to more effectively defend against the invasions at the beginning.

Hi Gabriel,

My name is Jan. I play as 'PeatMan' on KGS. I'll be your reviewer. My comments wil be indicated by "J:"
Bear in mind I'm only 5th kyu on KGS. That means that my comments may not always reflect the best advice, but it's the best I can give. 

There are 2 points that seem most important to me:

1) I think you should accept that white can (most of the time) live when he invades. The trick is to attack him and put pressure on him in such a way that as much as possible of your claimed area  will turn into solid points that cannot be invaded anymore.
When attacking: Attack from a distance. 
Try reading a book about attacking. (e.g.  http://www.kiseido.com/Begin3.htm#K14)

2) Mind your shape. When you construct better shapes you are less vulnerable to counter attacks and breaking through of enemy stones. (wich happens a few times in your game!) You can attack more freely with safe groups and strong shapes. Seemingly less efficient structures may cost a few points, but it safes a lot more afterwards.
I cannot recommend a book about good shape because I haven't read one myself. (Anyone have a good title?)]
;W[jq];B[jc];W[mc];B[gd]C[J: 

Black claims lots of territory with G16, but because of its high position it is not so solid. For solidness I'd play G17. 
Alternatively -If you want to claim a lot of territory and apply some pressure on N17- you can play K15. I think this is the best move.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[og]C[J:
Quite high and far from Q16. 
When I first saw this move I knew it wasn't good, but I couldn't exactly pinpoint why. It seemed too unsolid to me.

Later on in the game (see move 139) you'll see that P13 is not the best place for this stone: white breaks through quite easily. 

I'd do black Q14. Black R14 is also possible, although that move might be a little too timid.]
;W[rc]C[I am a little surprised by white's action here since this ends in gote.

J:
I suppose he's just trying to secure life here.];B[rd];W[pc]
;B[qd];W[sc];B[sd];W[ra]C[J:
He got himself a nice safe corner but lets you claim lots of territory.]
;B[nq]C[This seems a poor choice in retrospect - maybe should have strengthened the left side instead?

J:
Playing in this area seems fine to me. It applies some pressure on K3. And yes: you could have played from the other side at F3, but I think there's little difference. If you play O3 he'll try to play G3 or if you do F3 he'll do N3.
You could consider N3 instead of O3, but personally I like the solidness of O3 more, especially because it's a handicap game.]
;W[qm];B[pn]MA[qo]C[J:
This is again (like G16 and P13 before) a little high.  You are giving him the possibility to jump into the corner later with S5, as he does later on.

I'd prefer black R5 instead of Q6.
You 'll have a stronghold in the corner and you are free to attack K3 and R7 then.]
;W[rj]
(;B[qi]C[J:
Better play R10. See variations.];W[ri]
(;B[qh]C[J:

Blocking at S12 is better. You are letting him too far.];W[ro]
;B[qp]MA[rq]C[J:

S3 would be better shape. This is too heavy and white can still slide further.]
(;W[rp];B[rq];W[qn];B[qo]C[this also seems a wasted move - should have taken G3 instead?

J:
I think you should make a move in this area but not this one. You've  made an empty triangle wich is generally considered as "bad shape". I think a solid move like Q5 would have been better. Now you still have a weakness there for no good reason.]
;W[gq]C[J:

Inevitable.];B[eq];W[cg];B[ci]C[J:

OK: Attack him from your weakest side.
Good attack: You don't touch his stones, but just deny his eye space on his lower side.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc]
(;B[cb];W[cm];B[cl]C[J:
I would first attack from the corner, C5. Your D10 group is not so weak compared to C7. When your corner is strong you can pay attention to the D10-group wich is still at least as strong as his C7 group with an added stone.

But when you insist on attacking from the D10-group: The best attacks are not contact moves. The best attacking is done from a distance, stealing eyespace, blocking escape routes.
So this move is not a good attack, I think.];W[dm];B[bm]C[J:

Hmmm.....
Your contact move made him stronger and you have to watch out now for your center-left group. 
Still I think C5 is a better move now. Maybe sacrifice a stone from the left center, but walk out with the rest.]
;W[bn];B[al];W[co];B[cp];W[bp];B[bq];W[aq];B[ar];W[ap];B[cr]
C[J:

OK. You have the corner, but your center left group looks a little thin. But then again his stones below that group are also not safe yet...]
;W[an]C[J:

.. and he knows.];B[eo];W[dl];B[ck];W[fl];B[fj];W[do];B[fn]
;W[en];B[fo];W[fm];B[ho];W[mr];B[nr];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[no]
C[J:

N5 is better. He can atari at N5.];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[pr];W[kq]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[ln];W[bb];B[ba]MA[rh][eg]C[J:

Too small for now. This is an endgame move.
It might be a good move if you want to kill it, but I don't think that is possible.

Blocking at S12 is bigger, for instance.
or E13 would make a nice mojo and a connection with your weak left-center group.]
;W[cd]
(;B[de]C[J:

This leaves lots of cuting points. Be more solid.];W[ce];B[df]
;W[cf];B[dh]MA[eh]C[J:

Too close. He can peep through (and he does later on.)];W[dg]
;B[eg];W[bh];B[bi]C[J:

Your group is OK when it is connected.
The area in your center-left is too small to defend right now. 
Try securing your connection. E14?];W[eh]C[J: 

OK. Let's see what happens now.];B[fh]MA[fg]LB[dh:A]C[J:
It's not nescesary to put him into atari right away.
F13?

He cannot capture A and treathen your group yet. His cutting stone is too weak now.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[ec];B[eb];W[ef]
(;B[ei]MA[fj][al][bm][dj][cl][ck][bi][ci]C[E11 looks like a mistake - was E15 the right move?

J:
I think you went wrong earlier, but given the circumstances you may want to let him eat the D15-group and seal him in.]
;W[ed];B[fb];W[fg];B[ff]C[J:

Hmmm... I would cover and keep my centergroup safe and try to make the most of the top group. Maybe seal him off if still possible.]
;W[eh];B[fe];W[ee];B[eg];W[gg]MA[eh]C[J:

This worked out quite good for you. This your chance to take the ko. Where are the two single stones going after taking the ko?

The question is wether white will be able to break through the wall. See next variations.
(To be honest: I think I would not foresee the outcome of the 2 variations I made if this was a live-game, but I probably would have taken the chance: It seems playable to me.)]
(;B[gf]C[J:

Ai ai: Empty triangle.
Not always bad, but always (very) seriously consider other moves.]
;W[eh]C[J:

A Ko fight starts. 
I would have ignored some treaths. 
Always consider ignoring the treath.];B[rn];W[rm];B[eg];W[fc]
C[J;

Don't ignore this one.];B[gc];W[eh];B[so];W[sn];B[eg];W[mo]

(;B[op]C[J:

Seemed ignorable. See variation.];W[eh];B[bo]C[J:

This is worth 6 points or so. The group is safe anyway.
I would ignore if I were white.]
(;W[ao];B[eg];W[br];B[bs];W[eh];B[qk];W[eg]C[I was surprised by this.  Did White just decide he didn't have enough ko threats, or was I underestimating the importance of the ko?

J: 

This is a big treath. But the result is that your centre left group definately needs attention.]
;B[rk]C[J:

Yes. Take it.];W[pm];B[nl]C[J:

Good: From a distance.];W[sp];B[sq];W[od]C[J:

The stone at P13 would be better at Q14. You could safely play P15 and extend to O15.]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[nd]C[J:

As white proves later: to much cutting points because of bad shape. Better repair.]
;W[oc];B[me]C[J:

Seems like the wrong direction or better not even atari, but repair at P14.]

;W[oh];B[pg]C[J:

This is just one not so important stone..
Try to see if there is a beter move yielding more points.];W[mh]
;B[kg];W[ch]C[J:

This was a move black should have taken when he could. 
It would secure his life.];B[di]C[J:

One stone won't safe the group. 
You do not nescessarily need this one.];W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[gk]
;W[hi];B[fh];W[ih];B[ki]C[J:

You are probably trying to prevent a connection between two strong groups.

From the other side! You are hurting your weak group.];W[hj]

(;B[lk];W[im]C[I evidently wasn't doing enough to save the left side (I mistakenly thought A7 would make it live).  But I'm still confused as to exactly when that group died.  Was this the killing move (so I should have played K8 earlier)?  Or could it still have survived with K8 on move 210?

J:

The variations you made on move 210 seem OK.

So: yes, you payed too little attention on your centergroup. 
But even now there seem to ways out....]

I think it was a good game to review and I enjoyed reviewing it!
The review reminded me once again on the importance of attacking in the right way and on the importance of good shape, so I learned something too. I sometimes seem to forget. :-)

If you have any questions feel free to email me.
Or you can contact me when you see me on KGS (or DGS or incidentally even IGS) and we can play a game if you want to.

Succes! Have fun with your games!

I had a large variation here but I think that is speculation, so I took it away. White can spoil the corner further, but black must take something in compensation. For example a wall facing the center. 

(Then a good strategy would be to attack the K3 stone from the left, pushing him towards your wall and in this way taking large portions of the left side.)]
