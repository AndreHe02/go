RE[W+10.5]

C[Hello!

It would be great if you could go through that game and give me some ideas
how I could improve.

There occured some situations where I didn't know what to do. I added some
questions...

Thank you very much for spending your time, reviewing my game.

Joerg. (played black, and around
10k)];B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[cf];B[jd];W[nq];B[pn]
;W[jp];B[qj]C[I think it is a peaceful development. Very moyo-oriented game.

Yes.  R11 is a very
important move here.  White may take the lead if he is allowed to play
around R11 or R8.
Big points for black now are P10, C6, Q2, O16; I have a hard
time deciding which is biggest.];W[kf]C[Now, what is that? It seems, if I
defend territory, White will invade at R17.   My idea was to wait for his
invasion and then build strength to attack this stone. So I played at
another part of the board.

Yes, this move seems a little early.  White should think about P10,
perhaps, or simply D6, but I think D6 would be too easy for black.  O5 is
very big too.  In fact that's where I would play if I were white in this
position.

Black N5, aiming at a large-scale attack starting with J14, might be an
interesting reply.];B[cn]C[What would you have done? Defending the upper
side? Breaking out around J14? Where is a good point for invading the lower
side?

This move is not so good, because white is already low at C14.  If white
answers with a simple move like F4 to get sente, it's probably a good
exchange for white.  E6 should be interesting for white too, reducing
black's moyo.

I think where the two moyos meet at N5 is the biggest direction for black.
Or, an immediate attack on L14 with J14.  Even answering at M16, taking 4th
line territory, is not bad either.

So, I think N5 is worth considering, but your suggestion of J14 is fine
too.  M16 is a little passive but probably playable too.  For invading the
lower side, it seems a little small and thin.  Wait a while to see how
things develop first (your right side is more important right now).]
;W[cl]C[Here's another joseki you could try that achieves the purpose of
making white overconcentrated on the left side and getting you an easy
life.]
(;B[en]C[Ich darf Weiss kein Moyo machen lassen.

Lucky I know some German :)
"I don't want to let white make
a moyo", is that about the translation?

Anyway, this answer is OK.  White will be overconcentrated on the left side
(you'll press C8 down low and C14 is already low) while you get some
thickness in the center.

C8 is the wrong direction; the lower side is bigger than the left, so E6
or F4 is better, I think.  White probably thinks that this is a severe
attack on black, but it really isn't.];W[fp];B[dk];W[dl];B[el]
;W[ck];B[ek]C[If I played at D10, White could cut,
and the ladder would be good for him because of L14. So L14 is a kind of
"reverse ladder-breaker". :-))

I think it's a good choice of joseki, but the bad ladder means you should
have played J14 first.

Maybe the joseki attaching on top at D8 would have been a better choice
with J14 not on the board.];W[ci];B[nc]C[This is defensiv. But I had no
better idea. I thought that the black group on the right side could easily
escape. I was wrong...

It is way too slow.  If you are going to defend, do it around M16 to attack
more.  J14 is also good (cutting off the retreat).

Black's shape on the board as a whole is not looking very effective.  What
is the purpose of those stones in the lower left?  They are outward facing
but not very strong.];W[ne];B[md];W[ng];B[pf];W[kh];B[hm]C[This shows that the joseki here was bad for
you.  This joseki is supposed to give white territory and make thickness
for black in exchange.  If you have to play extra defensive moves, then
it's not thickness!

White's weak group has become strong so the game looks hard for black.  But
black has a large territory, so the game is still close.  The question is
how much white can gain by attacking these black stones.];W[ho]
C[This is a
little off; G5 is better shape for defending the lower side and for
attacking (G7 later may be interesting)];B[if]C[It's too late for this
move now; white has good shape already.];W[je];B[ie];W[kd];B[jc]
C[What would happen if you played more aggressively (L17)?  Letting
white in here is very painful.];W[kc]C[The J14 stone is not worth it if you
have to let white in like this.];B[le];W[ke];B[hd]C[Bad shape.  H17 or K18
are better.];W[jb];B[ic];W[ib];B[hb]C[A bad exchange for white.  M18 is
better, then jumping on one side or the other later (that is, after M18,
if you play J18 white gets O18 or P19 later; so white gains more
total).];W[mf];B[lb];W[kb];B[pq]C[Another defensiv move, I aimed at an Invasion around
M3. But maybe this move was too early.

I would play D18, making your group completely safe and taking territory up
there.  This is not really defensive, since your group is not weak; it
takes territory and threatens M3 later.  Similarly D18 takes territory and
defends your group.  So they are big places to play.  Nobody's going to
make a lot of points in the center, so the corners are big.

Actually D3 might be even bigger than either of these
moves.];W[lq];B[bp]C[I realized that this group could be split. So I tried
to get some eye-space.

This is a mistake: the C6 stone must be treated lightly (or, play E7 to
connect it if you want).  That is, you should play C3, not
B4.];W[cq]C[That was a bad exchange for you; white gets territory and your
shape is still bad (how do you answer D7?)];B[oj]C[This sort of move
works better with N5.  You played Q3 instead, emphasizing the corner
territory.  So now this move looks slow.  "Take territory while attacking"
is a good idea, so maybe P12 or Q12 would have been the move.

This whole game looks a little awkward for black.  White's lower side and
left side add up to more than black's big side, and white's weak group
looks better than black's weak group.];W[pg];B[qg];W[qf];B[ph]
;W[pe];B[og];W[of]C[If you play R15, the ko is so huge that white
will allow you two moves in a row anywhere you want to play them, just
about.  If you get R15 and P15, white's weak group is much weaker and your
territory becomes rock-solid.  C10 and B10 would be a nice pair of moves,
don't you think?  So play R15!];B[no]C[This is TINY compared to R15.  I think even P2 is bigger than this
move.  Defend your weak stones first!  So R15 is huge.  Or, if you're too
scared of that move, R16.

If you're thinking purely about territory, you won't get stronger.  But O5
is not even the biggest territory on the board; D18 is
bigger.];W[qd]C[Ouch.  Now black is in BIG trouble.];B[qc];W[pg]
C[Why does
white play this move?  It is unnecessary.  White S17 would start a ko that
might kill black's whole corner.];B[pc]C[Now black is definitely
alive.];W[dm];B[dn];W[em];B[fm];W[fn]C[Uh oh.  Now you see that B4 was too heavy;
black's cut-off stones still don't have enough space for eyes.]
;B[bq]C[I am
trying to live.];W[br];B[cp];W[dq];B[bm];W[bl];B[bo];W[do]C[Black's bad position here is because of B4.  C3 was a very
important move.];B[an]C[I succeded, but it is small live.

And your upper right corner is destroyed; it looks like white should win
by a LOT of points by now.

Black has about 40 points, and white has about 48, and it's
white's move, not to mention komi ... plus black's weak stones in the
center are in bad trouble, and black's upper-side group might get in
trouble if white plays D18 (at least, D18 should be a big sente point for
white to get even further ahead).];W[fl]C[This move is too small; black doesn't need the one stone.  White
should attack on a large scale at G9 or just patiently play D18 and see
what happens.];B[fk];W[gm];B[eh]C[Is this move good?

Black needs space to live!  Running toward your friendly group, trying to
connect, is the right idea.  But the particular move is not so good.  D12
might force C12 as a reply, so you get sente; F13 would be more certain of
conecting to the top group (and if white cut off the lower four stones, at
least white would only get a small area there).];W[gk]C[This is a little
slow, but white is ahead, so it's probably OK.  White can think about
getting a big center later with a move like N8.];B[lf]C[This just forces
good shape for white.  I don't see that this big group can get into eye
trouble.];W[lg];B[jg];W[kg];B[mh];W[mg];B[lo]C[THis is a good move; prevents white from
getting a big center, and expands black's side too.];W[jn]C[Answering here
is too small for white.  D18 is bigger.  Even P2 is bigger.  S11 looks like
a tesuji; does it work?  Anyway this move for white is very
small.];B[km]C[Black gained in this exchange, but still D18 or P2 is
bigger!];W[oh]C[This makes white's group absolutely safe, so I think the
game is over.];B[jm];W[mj]C[This is very small.  D18 or P2 are much bigger
endgame moves!];B[ni];W[li];B[rd];W[qe]C[White has very little to lose by fighting a ko
here, but I suppose a simple answer is not bad either.];B[dc]
C[I think D18
is slightly better (white probably answers at C17 anyway, and D18/C18 is a
better combination)

But you certainly moved in the
most important part of the board here.  White (or black) should have
moved here sooner!];W[cc];B[ed];W[cd];B[ee]C[Black gets safety but in gote.
White should play P2, then D18, and start wrapping up the win.]
;W[fj]C[If
black ignores this, and white moves again, white still only gains 10
points.  Meanwhile black plays P2, and if white ignores that, M1 or N2.  So
black gains about 10 poitns in sente on the lower side while white gains 10
points in gote in the middle.  P2 is bigger (almost twice as big) as this
move!

D18 is bigger too.];B[di];W[dj]C[Wups!  The four stones are small compared to
C12!];B[ei];W[ej];B[ch];W[bi]C[White lost a lot of points here;
effectively white took 8 points but lost about 8 points on the side of the
board, and ended up in gote. So this exchange for white was about like if
white played on a dame.  Not good!];B[nk]C[Wups!  Isn't B12 much bigger
than this?  After B12, white has to worry about life in the upper corner.
In fact P2 is bigger than this move in the center, because it's sente for
both sides.];W[or];B[pr];W[ll]C[This move looks like sente, threatening to
cut off black's center stones.];B[db]C[It's hard to say whether this or B12 is bigger.  But B12 makes the
game more complicated, since it cuts white's two groups.  So, play that way
- you are behind, so make the game more complicated.

Still, D18 is a huge point, but the game is over if white M6 or N6 works to
cut off the center...];W[bh];B[bb];W[cb];B[ca];W[bc];B[gh];W[mm]
C[Probably
better to peep at N6 instead.  White may succeed in cutting off the center
then.];B[nn];W[kn];B[lm];W[ln];B[mn];W[ml];B[in];W[jo];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[lk];W[mk];B[jk];W[kj];B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[ih];B[hj]
;W[jh];B[gi];W[hh];B[gj]C[I managed to connect. :-)

The rest is endgame. I am not really good at that. Maybe you could point
out the larger mistakes.

OK.  Let me count the score at this moment.  Looks like a pretty close
game, actually!  White is a few points ahead on the board, plus any
komi.];W[hg]C[Big because it's sente.  S11 tesuji, does it work?  Then it
is big.  S13 for black looks biggest around there.  N18 is pretty large
too.  J19 is big too.

You can tell you've done well or poorly in the endgame by how many of the
big points you get.  There are a few smaller issues (did you take one
point in sente when the opponent got two points?) but the important thing
is spotting the big points
first.];B[gf];W[hf];B[he];W[om];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[nj]C[uh oh, black's
attempt to cut turned out to be an overplay.];B[ok];W[oi];B[pi]
C[White gained several sente points
there!];W[qh];B[rh]C[nice tesuji for you.];W[rg];B[ri];W[ps]
;B[qs];W[os];B[qr];W[mp]C[small but sente, OK.  Usually save these sorts of things for
ko threats, and play around N18 first.];B[oq];W[mr];B[mo];W[ba]
C[SMall
mistake by white here; and this is not the biggest area anyway.  N18 is
bigger.  A2 is bigger, I think.  But again, as long as it's sente it
doesn't really matter.  But is it really sente?  What would happen if black
answered at A2, white D19, black C2?  Who gains more?

Always remember in the endgame, the best response to your opponent's sente,
so long as your group is not going to die, is an equally big sente threat
of your own somewhere else.

Otherwise your opponent keeps sente the whole time and gets all the big points.

You need to count whether the exchange (you play A1 and C2 while your
opponent gets D19) is better for you or for him.];B[aa];W[ac]
;B[da]C[Here
the threat is even smaller; if white plays A18, you lose only 4 more
points.  A2 looks bigger.

Before you decide whether to attack or defend, count to see which is
bigger!  Here it's clear that the threat of A2/C2 is bigger than A18 for
white, so if you play A2 white will answer instead of playing A18.]
;W[hn];B[hl];W[gg];B[ff];W[fg];B[eg];W[df];B[ef];W[ld]C[I think N18 is bigger.
Especially since this is gote for white.  In fact A2 is bigger than
this!];B[mc];W[me];B[eo];W[ep];B[cg];W[bg];B[kp];W[kq];B[fo]
;W[go];B[de];W[ce];B[ia]C[A2 is bigger!];W[ja];B[ha];W[al]C[Even now, can you play A2?  If
white ignores it to take away the eye at A7, you capture at C2 and still
live, right?];B[am];W[ar];B[aq];W[re];B[rc];W[od];B[oc];W[nd]

;B[si];W[sg];B[jq]C[Trying to make trouble. Usualy am avoiding
this kind of fight, where you hope that the opponent makes a dumb mistake,
but I feel that I need some points, so I am trying... It will  not work
though.];W[iq];B[gp];W[gq];B[jr];W[ir];B[ms];W[ls];B[qi];W[qg]
;B[la];W[ka];B[pm];W[cm];B[co];W[fi];B[fh];W[ab];B[ba];W[ig]
;B[jf];W[jj]C[This is the end. White wins with over
ten points I think.

It is a surprisingly close game to me; it felt like black got much farther
behind.

Major things to remember:
When your opponent plays something that looks like sente, see if you have a
sente move with an equally big threat, so that you can trade sente moves
instead of always answering.

In the endgame, look around the corners for the big moves.  Both sides let
big moves (D18, P2, A2) remain unplayed for far too long.

In the middle game, connect your groups more (you allowed white to break
through in two places, L17 and R15, and white later allowed you to break
through at C12).  Don't let that happen.

Also, the sort of compromise you made at B4 is representative of a lot of
your game.  Play C3 instead, boldly offering an exchange, instead of making
a tiny life for the stones you already have played.])

;B[bp]C[I think this last move is necessary because otherwise if white
plays here, black's life is in danger.  Besides being important for life,
it's also worth a lot of points in the corner, so it seems like a
worthwhile move.]))
