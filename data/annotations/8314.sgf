I am black in this game.

Recently I have been trying to break out of the habit of grabbing territory and concentrate more on
creating and using influence.

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer.  This was a good game for B, with several nice moves, but also a few lapses.  You achieved your goal of creating and using influence, and your overall strategic decisions were good.  Try to look a little harder for strong tactical moves, read a little deeper in close fighting situations.]
;W[pq];B[cd];W[ed];B[ee];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[fe];W[bd]C[[EV\] This move is unusual, but I do not see any immediate refutation.  B can be satisfied that W forces him to protect the cut at D15.]
;B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[fd]C[[EV\] This seems like a mistake, inviting a strong B double hane.  The hanging connection (F17) is usual, instead of the hane at B16, and still looks correct here.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[ge];B[hd];W[fb];B[gb];W[fc]
(;B[dj]C[[EV\] Good!  B played well here and ended up with a nice position, getting both a wall and an extension from the wall.]
;W[df];B[de];W[gf];B[eg];W[cl];B[cn]CR[cl]TR[ge][gf]LB[cj:a]
C[[EV\] This may be a good move objectively, since B is fairly strong above and does not mind fighting there.  But in a handicap game for sure, and maybe even in an even game, I would probably play at A, to secure the territory above, limiting the potential for W to make use of the triangled cutting stones.  The circled W stone is already pincered and has no room to make a comfortable base, so B should get a good result, with less room for W complications.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[bi];B[ck];W[bj]
(;B[bk]C[[EV\] This feels like a overplay.  If W simply cuts at D9, B will have to give up some stones on one side or the other, giving W an easy life.  See variation for an alternative.]
;W[di];B[dk];W[dh];B[fg]
(;W[if]LB[fi:a]C[[EV\] W does not really have time for this.  The marked point is vital for both sides.]
;B[fi]C[[EV\] Perfect!  This move should feel really good, whether or not W can live on the left.]
;W[bg]C[[EV\] Does this move really make two eyes?  The game is lost for W if B can come back to kill this group any time in the future.  Pretend this is a life-and-death problem in a book before looking at the variation ....]
(;B[jd]C[[EV\] Why not extend one space further?];W[gh];B[ei]

;W[kc];B[je];W[nc];B[lg];W[li];B[oe];W[nf];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]
(;W[pb];B[ng];W[qc]C[[EV\] Both sides are already alive, so this move and the B response are endgame moves.  There are more vital points elsewhere.]

(;B[eq]C[[EV\] Is this exchange necessary or useful?  See variation.]
;W[fp];B[ip]C[[EV\] This seems like a speculative move, not quite attack, not quite invasion.  It would be safer without the previous kick, which strengthened W.]
;W[ho];B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[kp]C[I was hoping to use the N4 stone but W escaped too easily in the center and ended up with the right side.]
;W[mn];B[jm];W[il];B[nl]LB[ol:a]C[[EV\] The leaning attack at A looks stronger.  It is a more severe attack on the lone W stone, and it removes all cut aji.]
;W[pn];B[jl];W[ik];B[qn]C[[EV\] B really wants to atari the other direction (if he can capture the cutting stone) or not at all (if the corner is already safe).  The atari in this direction strengthens W for the center fight.  It takes some reading, but I think B can and should avoid this move.]
;W[pm]
(;B[ol]C[[EV\] Taking a W liberty is not very important -- see variation.]
;W[rn]C[[EV\] Is this really sente?  Playing first in the center is worth some pain in the corner.]
(;B[qo];W[rm];B[ro];W[ll]C[[EV\] Ouch.  Now W has lots of counter-play and the situation is suddenly very difficult.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[gm];W[gn];B[mq]
(;W[pi]C[[EV\] This is a little loose.  The center B group has very few liberties, and capturing it seems like a win for W.  See variation.]
;B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[pg];B[oh];W[ph];B[of];W[ml]C[I think that by this point I had lost most of my 2 stone advantage.

[EV\] Yes, the game looks close now, assuming nothing large dies.  There is still lots more fighting, but I think the most interesting part is over.  Comments end here.]
