C[[Actorios\] Many thanks for taking the time to review this game.

ER:  Hi, my name is Eric and I'll be reviewing this game for you.  My comments are prefixed with 'ER'.  If you have any questions feel free to get in touch with me on KGS (EricR) or by emailing me.  Hope you enjoy the review!]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qj];W[mc]LB[ep:A]C[[Actorios\] Is it correct to approach at this stage when both corners are not secured after a komoku?

ER:  This approach feels mistimed since a play around A is large for both players.  If you play there (or E3) then you have a nice shimari facing the left side of the board, and you can work with D17 to build from that.  If Black plays there then he expands his framework and limits you at the same time.

Also consider which of your two stones on the left is better for Black to approach.  If you play at E3 or E4 then he can still stop you from making the shimari at C15, but if he does so that move will not simultaneously expand his own framework.  On the other hand, a move at A is a large, dual-purpose move for Black.

So I think White should make the shimari in the lower-left first, and then worry about approaching.  Playing at A serves two purposes for bother players; you should rush to be the first to get those moves in the opening.]

(;W[cn]LB[cm:A]C[ER:  The joseki move is at A.];B[hq];W[qo]
TR[qj]C[ER:  Because of the marked stone, this type of approach to the Low Chinese fuseki favors your opponent.  He could play a move like P4 to put pressure on you and build up the bottom at the same time.

That said, it is usually better to approach Q3 from the other direction---from the bottom.]
(;B[qp];W[po];B[nq]
(;W[ql]C[[Actorios\] The extension is short... should I have attached the black stone?

ER:  No, this looks fine.  When you attach you make your opponent stronger.  He is already strong in this area, so you do not want to make him even stronger.]
;B[rk];W[ol]C[[Actorios\] Was this an appropriate response? Is the shape correct?

ER:  Yes, I think this looks good.];B[pm];W[pl];B[on]
(;W[pn]C[[Actorios\] Bad shape but I wanted to connect... Maybe R7 was simpler and more efficient

ER:  You are correct.  R7 is a better move to connect.];B[qm]
;W[om];B[rm]LB[ol:A][nn:C][po:B]TR[on]C[ER:  I could not find a way of catching P6, so I think you may have to choose one of the two groups to save.  Which means, which is more valuable, A or B?

I would save the A stones.  The B group has a bad shape, has little room to move, and is not threatening Black.  The A group is not attacking Black either, but at least by saving those stones you will reduce Black's influence in this area.  If he swallowed the A group then his influence in the center of the board could be over-whelming.

So I think you should play at C and make the most out of sacrificing those three stones.]

;W[ml];B[nl];W[nk];B[mo];W[mm];B[no];W[mp]C[[Actorios\] Was there a better way to deal with this fight for white?

ER:  I think the previous comments showed a better way.  The way you play here makes the stones at O9 really weak and gives Black the chance to create massive influence in the center.]
;B[lo];W[lp];B[ko];W[kp];B[jo];W[mr];B[jq];W[kr]C[[Actorios\] Here I think I'm unconditionnally alive. I also thought that I could get an eye on the other side by exploiting the aji.

ER:  I agree, I think you are unconditionally alive.]

(;W[rq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rr];W[sp];B[sr]C[[Actorios\] Unfortunately, this didn't work...

ER:  It was a good try, and at least you still have sente.  Because your opponent had nine points of territory in the corner, I do not believe you could have killed him in any way, but I could be wrong.]
;W[rl];B[sl];W[sn]C[ER:  Better to save this as a ko threat for later.  Or go ahead and sacrifice the stones by playing P10 like you considered earlier.]
;B[sm];W[mk];B[pg]
(;W[ce]C[ER:  Good move, this is big!  How about playing P10 first though?  That will make your stones in the center a little bit stronger, since Black could launch a big attack on them.  Then you can play C15.]
;B[jc];W[hc];B[je];W[me];B[mg]
(;W[oi]C[ER:  This should be at P10, because after Black plays P10 you do not have a good follow-up.

Or you could play to help the stones at N15 or N17.  In the variations I have explored different possibilities.  I am honestly not sure which is best.  Personally, I would play to help the two stones up top.]
;B[oj];W[pc];B[nd];W[nc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[qc]
(;B[md];W[qd]TR[jc][je]C[[Actorios\] I was surprised black didn't play R16

ER:  Black may have been worried about what could have happened to the two marked stones and how you could have hurt his influence in the center.  Here I suspect Black is letting you live easily in the corner to continue to build his moyo.  See the previous variation.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[qf]
(;W[rf]C[ER:  This move feels too small right now.  I think you should help your stones at N9 before Black swallows them completely.]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[ni];W[qg];B[rh]
(;W[kd]TR[oi]C[ER:  You have played this type of move twice, a keima where you could have played a hane instead.  It is almost always better to play the hane.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[rd];W[rc];B[jd];W[jk]C[[Actorios\] I should probably have played this move before... It was critical, I believe.

ER:  Very nice!  And yes, I think you should have played this earlier :)]

(;W[bd]C[ER:  Is this necessary?  I understand the temptation to play these moves just to be safe, but the score in the game was pretty close.  Giving up one point like this when you do not need to really defend can decide the outcome of the game.  Practicing life and death problems will help you know where you can afford to not defend.]

[rs]C[[Actorios\] The game was won for white but I missed the eye at M10... A lesson for the future.

ER:  Yes, it happens ;)

Overall I think you played well.  In the opening I think you put yourself in a bad position by playing deep into the Low Chinese, but you fought back well in the middle game and prevented your opponent from making the most out of his potential.  In general I think your attacks were good.  I suggest working on improving your opening game; if you put yourself ahead in the beginning, you should be able to hold that lead until the end of the game.

Thanks for the chance to review the game.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!]
