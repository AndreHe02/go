C[Nisse: Dear, Sebbe! Sorry about the delay. Please remember that I myself is only about 6k, so don't mistake my comments for those of an expert. A high ranking player may well disagree with me.

This is also my first game review on GTL.

Here goes!];B[pd]C[Zebasrin [16k?\]: Hi gg
Gabriel82 [15k\]: Hi gg];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[cd]C[Whites second stone is a bit unusual for beginners, but black's reply is fine.]
;W[kc];B[dc]LB[hc:C][df:A][cg:B]C[Black 7 I do not like.

Why? Because it does not threaten white 4 and does not give black any territoy either. A or B feels much better. Or even an agressive stone around C.]

[oq:11]C[What was your idea with this move?

I don't like it for two reasons:

1. It does not threaten white 16 at all.

2. It does not help black 1 to make a base. The group 1+17 is "floating".

Suggestions:
A does both 1  and 2. 
B does 2.];W[nc]C[White exploited black 17.];B[og]C[We are now getting in to the middle game with the first fight.]

If we look at the squares as white boundaries and the triangles as black boundaries we can see this.

Black is by no means beaten, but what should he do?

Well, you must either make your territory grow faster than his, or you must make his smaller...]
;W[en]LB[dl:A][gp:B][cq:E][fq:D][gq:C]C[White goes here, making his bottom moyo (potential territory) larger.

Black 35 at A (actual game) would be fine in an even game, but when you are behind it is not enough. 

In this situation I would try an invasion at B, C or D to try to destroy Whites territory. If you succeed in living there you might get even.

E is another possibility that should succeed, but perhaps is not enough.]

Zebasrin [16k?\]: Thanks

A few final remarks.

Your opening would benefit from studying a few basic josekis. But focus on only a few basic ones! Then use them a lot to try them out.

In this game your middle game was a bit to timid and respectfull. When you attack - believe in your attack!  When you feel that you are behind â€“ go on the offensive! You started some attacks but then became defensive again.

I hope my comments help you in your development as a go-player. Please feel free to ask further questions or comment on my review.

Bye!
