C[hello, my name is moku. I play around 14K and black in this game.   it would be great if you could give me a review of this game.   i made some bad mistakes during that game and i need some suggestions. i added notes at these moves.

thanks in advance,

bye, moku.


Okies - I've added some comments and varations to the game, I hope they're useful.  :-)]
;B[dd];W[oc];B[dp];W[qq];B[dj];W[fc]C[Black has three high stones here, White has three low stones.  Black should pick a joseki here that builds his influence and presses White down.  I feel d14 does not emphasize how low White's formation is.  See the variations.]

(;B[df];W[db]C[Black chooses to leave this joseki.  Normally Black plays c17 and White chooses j16 or k17 (j16 probably because p17 is low).  I don't konw if tunuki here is a good idea or not, but k4 is not the point I would choose next.  Instead maybe somewhere in the upper right corner?]

(;B[jp];W[cn];B[co]C[Yes, I would pick this move also.];W[dn]
;B[fp];W[dk]C[this should be not good for white, but how to continue. maybe e7?

Black should try to seal White inside, making influence on the outside.  See variation.]

(;B[cj]C[to passive?];W[ej];B[ei];W[ek]C[Now the White group is out in the center, so it is more difficult to profit from attacking it.]
;B[np]C[I don't like this move, it doesn't really put much pressure on r3, yet later o4 requires protection.  Locally q4 would be my choice.  However now that White has stones on e10/e9 the center is more difficult to grab, so maybe a move in the upper right corner would be good now...]
;W[pn];B[qk]C[is this good, or should i play a kakari against the upper right corner?

This move is very, very bad!  When White plays r11 next he gets a HUGE profit from Black's effort to save this one tiny stone!  r3/q6 cannot be attacked in a serious way here.  Locally you should be thinking light reduction, possibly a shoulder hit like p7.  But that doesn't seem like a good idea right now, so I would prefer a move in the upper right like you suggested.]
;W[qi];B[ok];W[nh]C[Ouch, in just two moves White has mapped out an absolutely huge moyo in the upper right!  Black's p9/r9 stones are not doing much here either.]
;B[qo]C[This does seem like a reasonable way to try to settle the p9/r9 stones.]
;W[po];B[qn];W[pp];B[pm];W[nn]C[White correctly prevents Black from getting a monopoly on the center.]
;B[lo]C[This move doesn't threaten White much, and it would take more than one more move to seal White in, so White ignores it.  But the worst part is that as the game later shows it doesn't even protect the territory here!]
;W[fi]
(;B[eh]C[Too passive!  You should be trying to break into White's sphere of influence here.  White is handicapped by the need to babysit the weak e9 group.  You can use this to force your way into the middle destroying White's moyo.  See the variation.]
;W[mp]C[I would play f15 or c17 as White here.];B[mo];W[mq]
;B[nq];W[nr];B[or];W[mr];B[no];W[oq]
(;B[cc]C[or a cut at f10?

Well c17 is certainly a very big move...  But f10 is a bad idea, maybe f12?  See variations.]
;W[id];B[qd]C[white build a big framework in the upper right. I had no idea where to invade it.   maybe i shoul have done this before. but when?

Ugh, White got to play j16 so now it's getting more difficult.  I'm not very strong at invading... Maybe o17?  k16?  Invading in the corner this way seems to give White too much on the top and in the center.]
;W[pe];B[qc];W[qe];B[pb];W[ob];B[re];W[rf]
(;B[ge]C[i knew, that the upper right corner was not already alive, but i thought i could manage it in case of an invasion there

Ugh, g15 is a very small move.  I think you should just make life and try to reduce the best you can after that.  See the variations.

But let's assume that you don't play in the corner, where is the best move in the center?  I would choose something like k16, k15, or maybe j17.]
;W[gd];B[fe]C[Not good shape.  Try to use both dimensions of the board, make 2-D shapes, not 1-D lines.  g14 for example strengthens the connection of g15 to it's friends, but also influences the center more.]
;W[om]C[White tries to come out in the center here, but I would kill the corner or play around h15.]
;B[pl];W[ik]C[White is nervous about his group here, and he has good reason to be.]
;B[if]C[Seems good.];W[hp]C[Basically this starts a dogfight.  It's dangerous for both sides, Black's k4/m5 and d4 groups are weak, but so is White's d6/e9 group.  I don't really know what to recommend here, it's too complicated for me!  :-)]
;B[iq]C[But I don't think this is good.  I would try h5 trying to connect the two Black groups, force White to make small life on the side, and then counter-attack d6/e9.  Remember to consider the whole board, not just the 15 points of territory on the 3 lines from f-k.]
;W[hq];B[ho];W[ip];B[io];W[jo];B[kp];W[jq];B[ir]C[Here I would play k6 instead, and White needs another move to make his group safe, and then Black can try to counter-attack d6/e9.]

(;W[hr]C[White lets Black off the hook.  See variation.];B[jr]
;W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[fq];B[gp];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[gq]
;W[fr]C[White is dead here, he should save these moves for KO.  Black on the other hand does want to make these moves so f4 and e3 can be connected if necessary later.]
;B[gr];W[cp]C[Doesn't work.  :-)];B[bp];W[bo];B[cq];W[do]C[white played not very good here...  Yeah, but he had chances as I showed.  Also d5 is small, Black correctly ignores it.  But I think the upper right corner is the biggest thing left.]
;B[jd]C[deeper invasion?

Save the corner, but as far as this area is concerned, I think this is a good move.]
;W[jc];B[ie]C[But now Black should continue l16 to continue reducing White's territory.]
;W[kd];B[hd];W[ic];B[hc];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fd]C[I don't think this was very successfull, if White plays k15 now he gets a pretty good territory in the middle here.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[qp]C[Ugh, bad move, should take sente.];B[pi]
C[This reduction is small, other than upper right corner, c18 is very big.  Locally s10 is a double sente move (sente for both sides) and therefore urgent.]
;W[ph];B[oi];W[oh]C[White doesn't have to play this...];B[gn]
C[Black tries to threaten the White group here...];W[kf]C[White ignores and expands territory.]
;B[em]C[But now I would strike the eye space from below, like c8.  This would send White running towards friends on l14/n12.  The problem is it's hard for Black to profit since White's territory is solid around the n15 area now.  Anything other than an outright kill (unlikely) will not be worth many points.    Upper right corner still.  :-)  c18 also still.]
;W[ck];B[bk];W[bl];B[bj];W[bm]C[White has one eye, he can easily make another.]
;B[lj]C[UR corner?  c18?  Ok, I'll quit typing that now.  :-)]

;W[qj];B[rl];W[ri];B[sk];W[pj];B[oj]C[Saving these two stones is worth 4 points!  What about the corner!?!]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[fl];B[cb]C[Aha, good.];W[rb]C[no it comes
alright, i will lose that corner and the game is decided.
would it be possible to save it know.
there is an interesting ko situation concerning this corner  later. but it would help me already if you could comment the game so far.
many many thanks.

No saving it now.];B[rc];W[qb];B[od];W[pc];B[il];W[mj];B[mk]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[jg];B[fb]C[e18 would be worth some points.  This is negative points move!  :-)]
;W[ec];B[ib];W[jb];B[mi]C[This move is gote.  How about t11?]

;B[ks];W[pr];B[sf];W[qf];B[si];W[sh];B[rh]C[Ok, Black got something out of the corner, a ko!]
;W[sj];B[ia]C[Gee, I don't know what to say about this ko... It's big, but so is j19!]

;W[jf]C[White wins by 2.5 points, very close!  I hope my comments help you.]
)
(;W[jr]C[White adds a stone to the sacrifice.  Black has a harder time capturing k3 now, and this gives White the time he needs to decimate Black.

Black's best chance would probably be to give up j2/j3 and play k6, saving his own stones.]
;B[hr];W[gq];B[kr];W[gr];B[kq];W[go]
(;B[fo];W[gn]C[Yikes, White took a big chunk out of the Black bottom, the black corner is in trouble, and White's middle group is doing fine.]
)
(;B[gp];W[fo];B[jn];W[ep];B[fq];W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[gs]C[The Black corner is dead.  I'm not even sure if White needs to add a move to make sure...]

(;B[fh];W[gi];B[id]C[Something like this to reduce?  Also the f10 cut point may still haunt White.  The danger here is that White may not answer f12 by g11, and instead play j16.  But at least in that variation Black has sente, as opposed to the f10 variation where White got j16 AND sente.]
)
(;B[fj]C[This is a _bad_ idea!];W[fk];B[gj];W[gk];B[gi];W[id]
C[Breaking the ladder, so if Black goes ahead and captures...]
;B[fh]C[The f10 cut has resulted in Black making 4 moves (f10, g10, g11, f12) to capture one stone, while White made 3 moves (f9, g9, j16) and has the chance to do something else.  This is a huge win for White.]

(;B[id]C[Here is another choice, again trying to build influence.]
;W[fe];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[ib]C[Black can move somewhere else now, perhaps r16.    Also an important point here is that Black should not add more moves around j16 for now.  Playing moves here where White is stronger will only help White.  Black should treat j16 lightly.]
