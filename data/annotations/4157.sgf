C[Dear reviewer,
I plaed black. Please help me to improve my game. This was tight one and I think I lost because suddenly I had a weak group to care that I only could rescue omitting strenght to my opponent.
Thank you in advance.

White is aiming to complicate things.  Usually if my opponent is aiming to complicate things this early I develop a very patient style.  Opponents who like complications and fights will often choose bad times so with patience you can wait for a favourable fight.]
;B[hd]C[I like this choice of joseki.  Be aware that the development of C16 will be slightly hampered by D4]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[pp]C[The LR is big, but leaving the UL unresolved is bigger.  Black can take a large sente move attacking it, and then get the key point of around D10. The game looks good for black already.]
;B[qn]C[Attacking E16 is sente and so bigger.  White should ignore R6 to put pressure on C16 and then answer R6.]
;W[nq];B[pj];W[pg]C[White is greedy, there is no way Q13 is the key area of the board.   With R3 and S4 still available black can tenuki to resolve the UL, and then gently lean on Q13, making it heavy.

You should win this game.];B[df]C[:)];W[gc];B[hc];W[fc]C[Now is when reading strength comes in.  Can black play a useful sente move against that group?  If F15 is sente then black should play it but if white can tenuki and live then black shouldn't.  Lets have a quick look.]

(;B[ga]C[G19 is a bad move.  It is gote and tiny.  Also, it gives white threats at G16 and J17 later.  The right side is much larger and so is C9 area.

C[This result is gote so not very good.];W[dj]C[black's early lead is gone, but the game still feels ok.  At least, black is not far behind. I think black needs to invade now, probably at F3.]
;B[of]C[This is ok, but a little premature.  Remember white cannot live without a base, and so simply playing R15 forces white to run as well.]
;W[oh];B[mg];W[jf]C[White is an overplayer.  I used to hate playing overplayers but now I quite enjoy the challenge of finding the refutations.

Black would like to punish white for ignoring N13 and I would choose O11 myself.]

(;B[go]C[Big or was c3 bigger?

I would have played N4, white is unlikely to answer G5 at C3 so C3 is still available.  

Remember that white has H9 in sente so the cut at G7 is a big problem.]

Ok.  White is the kind of player that I used to hate, but quite enjoy playing now.

Overall you got a nice initial lead and then lost it very fast with a couple small moves at critical points in the game.

Also you let white boss you around much too much.  Players like this push in the hope you will give way and you need to learn to hold your ground more.

While the final score is close, it swung very widely during the game.  You got a commanding lead in the fuseki and then lost it in the late fuseki.  Over the midgame white built up an excellent moyo while leaving you overconcentrated so that white had a comfortable lead after E3.  During yose a few slack moves by white such as C3 and missing E6, lead to you getting a lead again.  You then gave that lead away at O15, but took it back again at N7.]
