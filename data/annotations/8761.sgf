C[Hi, I'm Anand and I played Black in this game. I'm about 9kyu on IGS.

I finally lost on time, but at that point I believe I was slightly behind. But it was very close.

All comments you may have are welcome. I'm particularly interested in

A) The joseki on the UR corner and the resulting fight after White's invasion.

B) I have trouble deciding when to switch to endgame moves and not allowing a big center to the opponent at the same time.

Thanks.


D>  Hi sorry for the late review; I hope you still find this useful.  General comments to your questions: 

A)  I think studying josekis with a whole-board mentality will help.  For example, maintaining a balance of high and low stones along the sides is important.  I think this principle of balance was not always followed by black in this game.

B) I think black's error of focussing on the end game before the centre was settled might stem from not counting during the game.  Ensuring that there a good balance between territory and potential can begin very early.  As the game develops, estimating territory becomes essential.  Steve Fawthrop has written a set of very good lessons on counting which you can download .sgf files for at:

I have found them to be very useful.  

Cheers and I hope this was useful!

C[Is A better in the low Chinese opening?

DB>  I think A is the best move here.  It has better balance with the R9 stone and has influence to the top side.  A low stone here has very little effect on white O17 and results in two low stones along the right side.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]LB[qi:A]SQ[qc][pd][qf]C[This move always confuses me. To me it seems like an endgame move. However I'm aware that now the marked group can have trouble making two eyes. Playing A seems too passive. What is a good move here?

D>  Just tenuki.  A is certainly a wasted move.  If A, you would be placing 3 stones along the third line, all within 6 spaces of each other: overconcentration.  If white plays around A later, then black can simply jump out and the invading stone would be in some trouble.]
;B[fq]LB[jp:A]C[Is A (K4) better?

D>  I don't think it is better, just different.  If A, black is continuing to build a moyo, which is good, but it allows white to expand the left side into a moyo.  
F3 feels more flexible to me, but does allow white to pincer, which could diminish the moyo that black might build on the right side.  So I think on this board, F3 or K4 are both large moves.  For me, it might be just style, but I like F3 more.]
;W[iq]
(;B[cq]C[I am always confused with the low two-space pincer. On the one hand, I'm playing low Chinese opening, which is supposed to be a moyo game. On the other hand, I can't find a good move for black here developing the moyo. So I take profit in the corner. What are the alternatives?

D>  I don't think of the low chinese as a "moyo" game.  Indeed, it seems to me that the game will be determined by both sides.  Black cannot expect to have a "moyo" game if white is determined to break any and all moyo's that black starts to build.  In any case, I always thought that the chinese openings were about fighting - forcing white to invade into the growing moyo to gain territory/profit elsewhere.  If you want to continue that idea, why not jump out at F5 or counter-pincer? I explored these ideas in variations.]

C[Enclosing the corner. Played high to balance the top.

D> The balance is good.  The timing seems reasonable.  This is a big move.  now big areas on the board are the upper left and the lower right.  I think the upper left area is the biggest, but both white and black would find profit in an extension along the bottom.]
;W[qh]LB[ob:D][rd:C][bp:A][qp:B][gr:E]C[Here comes the invasion. I'm not sure if I mind this too much, since I can develop bottom moyo. Was it the right way to play?

D> you shouldn't mind this at all.  White is starting a weak group without good reason, I think.  In terms of territory, black is leading I think with one solid 10-12 point corner (group A),  a strong control over the corner (B) which will certainly result in some profit, but the corner is not yet 100% secure, and a small stable group (C) which is about equal in points to white's top group (D).  By my estimate, A and E are about equal, C and D are about equal, leaving black in a nice lead with whatever he will gain with B.  I think white would be better to expand from his D16 stone.  Perhaps the K16 area, which would build on D and coordinate with D16.]
;B[of]C[D> The only move I think.  Now white has to run into the centre with his invading stone, or force black to capture it in on a small scale.  Black is happy.]
;W[oh];B[ok];W[ng];B[nf];W[ld]LB[nd:B][lf:A]TR[ob][mc]C[D>  I don't like the attachment at B.  there is a little aji here with 2 knight's moves.  The marked points are possible cutting points that might be useful later.  If black B, then white will simply fix his shape and black would *still* be behind a line of white stones.  Why not just jump at A?  then white's weak group is once again inside of black's influence and will have to jump out again.]
(;B[nd];W[mc];B[oc];W[ob];B[lf]C[D>  I think this is less optimal - white's group has been solidified.  Granted, black gains a little eye space, but I'm not sure it was worth the cost.]
;W[lh];B[jf];W[jd];B[lq]C[D> Big move.  I might have liked to chase white's group first with a move around M10 though.]
;W[qm]C[White creates another weak group. I'm not sure this is a good idea. Comments about this?

D> Definitely not a good idea for white.  Starting a new weak group when one is already on the board is risky.]
(;B[pm]LB[om:B][pm:A]C[Looking back, I think this is a mistake. Perhaps not contacting the stone is better.

D> contacting will give white the chance to strengthen it.  the advantage for black in contacting is that it will strengthen black as well.  This way, black builds a strong wall, at the expense of losing some right side territory.  But this wall is facing a strong white group on the left side, so I don't think it is optimal.]

(;B[rj]LB[qj:A][rj:A]C[Is A (R10) is better? See variation

;B[lp];W[ko]
(;B[cf]LB[fc:A][cf:A]SQ[cn]C[Should I have continued on the right hand side? Where?

Also, is 3-3 invasion better here? Since marked stone is low. Also approaching at A (F17) seems to invite trouble.

D> The A is an invasion and not an approach.  If A, white will surely pinch and enclose the top side in one move.  I don't think this is good for black. The 3x3 invasion is out of the question: white would simply make a wall to build the top on a large scale.]

[kb][lb][mb][nb][bc][dc][rj][hp][fq][fr][gr][hr][ir]C[White seems to have both the corner and also threatens my territory. I'm uncomfortable here.

D> well, the amount of territory being threatened is small.  So I wouldn't worry about that.  Let's count points to see where things are at.

I count white with about 20 pairs (40 points).  Each square marks my estimate of 2 points for white.

I count black with about 24 pairs (48 points).  Eeach circle marks my estimate of 2 points for black.

So let's be conservative and say black is about 8 points ahead.  So white's gain isn't a bad exchange for black I think.

The question is where is black's next move?  Black's groups are stable and not in danger of being surrounded or killed; white's groups are also not in danger.  So we need to find the biggest move.  If white plays along the top side, around A, it could secure about 12 points for white.  if black plays around  B, it would secure about 6 points for black.  C would secure about the same - 6 points.  So I think the A area is the biggest move.]

C[To avoid leaving a big center to White. Good choice? When should I play endgame edge moves A, B, C, D, E, F?

D>  This is still in the middle game, so I don't think it is time for end game moves yet.  Especially B, D, E, or F.  These moves are all gote.  C is very hard to ignore and sente for both sides, so it is worth considering.  I think A is gote, but not 100% sure.

Since the middle is still undecided, it is the biggest area.  However, I don't like black's attaching move at L12, it seems to only help white secure the centre.

Instead, I would think about the "holes" in white's influence, which I have marked.  For me, I would rather just poke with moves in these areas before attaching.  (see variations).]
