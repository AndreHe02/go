C[Hello, I'm playing this game as white here. I will be glad If you can show me my main mistakes in this game.

thanks for the review.


---

Hello,

I will focus on what should be immediately useful, and on what I am reasonably certain about. I'm currently playing at the 4 kyu level on KGS (as Tictoc), so I do not know everything, far, far, far from it :)

In that context, I've analysed the fuseki thoroughly, added a few comments on the chuban, but I did not look much on the yose. By move 130 or thereabout, you had the win, so it did not seem necessary to comment.

My overall advice would be: early in the game, focus on building your potential, before you try to destroy your adversary's. Unless of course you can do both at the same time :)

Personally, I do not like reviews that offer a thousand variations. They feel tedious to me, so I will keep it to a minimum.

What else? You should be in the single-digit kyus in no time.

I hope this helps!

As you probably already know, this is the correct, standard approach against B's san-ren-sei formation.

I think the same approach on the top side might be better, but that is a question of style.

Everything's good.];B[pn]
(;W[qq]C[This is a mistake. Of course, W will live in the corner and B will loose potential territory, but it's too early in the game. This invasion gives B tremendous outside influence. This influence is worth much more than the small corner W gets in exchange.

Remember that this san-san invasion can be played later, when influence might count for less because the goban will be crowded. Of course, B can block the corner before that, but in doing so he will give you sente and you will use it to take a big point somewhere else.

Let me offer other options (see variation starting on 7).];B[pq]
;W[pr]C[this should have been R4 first?

---

From this position, this is the classic variation. No problem there.]
;B[qp]
(;W[rq]C[Not the best follow-up. See the variation: it's the classic joseki.]
;B[or];W[qs];B[oq]
(;W[ro]C[This is more of an endgame play. It's also dangerous, because the corner is not absolutely alive. I think a simple, sente push is better (variation starting on 15).

As you progress, you will see your adversaries respond less and less to those early provocations, and they will go for bigger plays.]
;B[rp]
(;W[pm]TR[nc][de][ci][jp]C[Were you thinking of reducing B's moyo? It's a bit early, and he's strong in that area. So in theory, a fight will not favor you. Think of a big play elsewhere.

Let me show you what I mean. Suppose B really wants to turn is right side in territory and that he will play two stones to do it (variation starting on #17).]
;B[sq];W[sr];B[sp];W[rr]C[Good defense. The corner is settled, but B has sente.

Go back to my comment at #8. Your corner is worth 3 points, with no influence. B has influence and sente. The outside W stones on the lower right are not connected. Not a good result.]
;B[os];W[ps];B[qn]C[Very small at this stage.];W[qm]C[Here again: you should ignore B's small move and play big elsewhere. In theory, a fight in this area will not turn in your favor. In this game, it certainly did not!
Sure you did well on the other parts of the board, but your later success had nothing to do with this early, moyo-destroying fight. Jump to #57 and see if you can agree with this assessment.]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[ol];B[rk];W[qk];B[sl];W[qj]C[Good reflex: as long as you're fighting, you have to find ways to weaken B's shape. Cutting a keima is almost always excellent.]
;B[ql]
(;W[pl]TR[pk]C[Since you are protecting yourself in gote, you might as well start bracing the lone B stone, an option that leaves less weaknesses.]
;B[rl];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[qf];B[nc]
(;W[ni]TR[pk]SQ[nc][pd]C[When you push out like this, especially when you are one stone behind, ask yourself what will be the outcome.

My impression is that it will not work here, because B can cut (triangle), and because the wall you are encouraging him to build is well oriented, toward the bottom, where he could expand his potential easily.

On the other side, your white wall will not have such an easy time, since B already has a strong shimari in the top right (squares)

I would favor a quick defensive maneuvre, then move to somewhere else (variation).]
;B[ml];W[nk];B[mj];W[mk]C[I know I should have connected with Q9 but I wanted to see what else I can do.

---

One of the reason I find go difficult is that quite often, even though we know very well what has to be done, we prefer to change things a bit... As beginners, this obsession with originality holds us back. When you know the correct play, go for it.]
;B[lk];W[ll];B[li];W[nl]C[Not good: you're helping B here, you're giving him the ladder that will create his impressive center influence.]
;B[mm]C[B is happy.];W[pk];B[kl]C[B is extatic!]
(;W[hp]TR[qf][ni][oi][pi][qj][mk][nk][pk][qk][nl][ol][pl][pm]
[qm]SQ[iq]C[If he answers K4, it will be too big profit I think, but where else could I play?

---

I would have gone a bit deeper, maybe lower (square), but this might be a question of personal habits (variation).

---

This is your first play since #4 that is not directly related to the action on the lower right. So the time is right to consider the situation:
(1) you managed to break up B's san-ren-sei formation
(2) your big right side group is still in danger (triangles); it can live, sure, but B can gain profit from attacking it.
(3) B's center influence radiates over the whole board, putting him in a good attacking position: ladders will be good for him, his invading stones will be able to reach to the center easily.

All in all, my main comment is that you focused too much on destruction. You got hypnotised by the san-ren-sei. Destroying potential is not enough to win, especially this early in the game. At this point, I would put my money on B.]
;B[lm]C[The correct play by B, even though it is gote.];W[ci]
TR[qf][ni][oi][pi][qj][mk][nk][pk][qk][nl][ol][pl][pm][qm]C[Always protect you weak groups before going for big plays. Here of course, your right side group is in trouble...]
;B[qi]
(;W[qh]C[I did atari this way without thinking as a mistake

---

It seems to me that either way, B's cut is working. Atari on the other side is  better, but it's going to get messy anyway. The important mistake is the previous stone: protect before anything else.]

[rj][mk][nk][pk][qk][nl][ol][pl][pm][qm]SQ[jp]C[he plays submissively as I saw from the earlier moves, that is why I chose to threaten but I still would like to know what the proper move would be.

---

There is no way your group (triangles) gets back from the dead, even if B lets you play the next move in the area (check it out). Consequently, N4 does not treaten much. If you want to play in the area, maybe to limit B's potential on the lower side, then you should play to create something that is solid and connected. Here, B can attack around K4 and W will have a hard time locally. Better play L3, or something like that.

One thing that I've learned from playing with stronger players – Parisian go clubs have their share of 2-3 dan – is that they never play in the hope that their adversary will react badly, unless they are in a very tight spot. My point is that if you want to get better, try not to play according to your adversary's bad habits. When this backfires because your adversary does not "cooperate", you wind up with a wasted move, or worse... Look for the best play you can devise, always.]
;B[no]C[B is wasting a move. This is the ACME of submissive, where he should be pushing you around...]
;W[mo]TR[kq]C[Your stones are still dead, even if B passes! Go for the side, if you must play in that area.]

TR[hp]C[this doesn't seem like a usual san san invasion. I think I made a mistake somewhere that he couldn't see.

---

Not really. Your H4 stones made it unecessary to stretch to G3, which is what you must do normally.

The play at D2 was useless, but it was sente, so no harm done.]
;W[hi]TR[jd][ei][fi]C[ok. I tought this a lot. Is this greedy or proper for making a big box.


---

Well, those strategical moves are not easy to evaluate for mere kyu players like us. But the real danger for you here is still B's influence in the center. Considering that influence is a tool for attack, I would have played a bit farther from it (triangle), or played to add to my already considerable left side potential. Let B in: he won't be able to destroy everything and you'll profit from his invasion.

Or you could consider securing the life of your upper right group. It's not exactly safe and if B attacks it, he will gain from it.]

(;W[ld]C[This feels like you're looking for a fight, to complicate things. But it seems you're ahead in the game, so I would advise restraint: play solidly. For instance, you could secure you upper right side group in sente.]

(;W[jc]C[I can't read too much. I tought he may cause trouble if I K18.

I think you're right. And letting your adversary crawl on the second line is rarely a bad idea. Here, by playing under, he helped you prepare to erase any potential he might have in the center.]
;B[mc]C[Not useful.]
