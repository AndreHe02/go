AB[pd][dp]C[dip: This was a DGS tournament game I lost again a stronger player. Why did I lost it? ;) I mean, how should  do I play? Where my main errors were? I pointed out some comments to explain why I did some moves.

Thank in advance to the reviewer!

Hello dip,

So I'll do my best to give you a thoughtful review - though I'm not so much stronger than you guys. I was 8k KGS, took a long break and at the moment am about 10k KGS. It's also my first Teaching Ladder review, so thanks for your patience. I hope my suggestions are helpful.
Jesse

jesse.haasch@gmx.net];W[dc];B[ce];W[ed];B[pq]C[dip: tenuki as i fear to end in gote and let W in another corner

Jesse: Good idea. I would have done the same.];W[po];B[qm];W[on]
;B[np]C[Jesse: I didn't know it, but it seems this is joseki. There's an interesting discussion to this on

http://senseis.xmp.net/?BQM209 

I've also given the standard moves as a variation.];W[pl]
(;B[pi]C[These moves seem a little strange to me. You might be giving up R7 too easily (see variations to move 10).]
;W[ql];B[qk];W[rl];B[dj]C[dip: letting R7 as a sleeper, sacrificing it

Jesse: Certainly now you can't do much there.];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]
;B[pf];W[kd];B[kc];W[jd]C[Jesse: I'm not sure if it's really a mistake, but as White I might have played M16. Letting my stones work together.]
;B[ld];W[le];B[ic];W[id];B[ke]C[Jesse: A strong cut, but in the end perhaps it helps White...]
;W[kf];B[je];W[lf];B[ie];W[hd];B[he];W[gd];B[hc];W[ig];B[gf]
;W[ni]C[Jesse: Now we see that White responded well to the cut at L15.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp]C[Jesse: That was a nice sequence for Black in the corner.]
;W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[dn];W[ip]C[Jesse: White is about to get too much influence in the center. Black mustn't let this happen. Perhaps L4 is better. Attacking J4, threatening to connect and looking towards the center.

I'm not at all an expert in these things, but the variation I've given might be much better.]

(;B[iq];W[jp];B[hp];W[ho];B[jq];W[kp];B[lq]C[Jesse: We can see this is much too nice for White.]
;W[dg]
(;B[ef]C[Jesse: Black should see that White can cut. D14 might be better. See variation.]
;W[df];B[eg];W[de];B[fd]C[Jesse: What's happening to C15 reminds me of what happened to R7. It's good to learn how to sacrifice, but also how to take care of your stones.

This move loses sente.];W[fc];B[fe];W[gc]
(;B[jc];W[md];B[mc];W[nb];B[mb];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[kb];W[la]
;B[ma];W[ja];B[ia];W[ka]C[Jesse: I tried a couple of variations seeing what would happen if black played G18 instead of K17, and kept the one with best play (as "best" as I can see it). Though it isn't at all better for Black.

So Black has defended well. Seki.];B[na];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[ei]
;W[cq]C[dip: i should have blocked the invasion before, but when? I had two groups to save in upper side!

Jesse: Maybe instead of R4 or instead of F16.];B[dq];W[dr];B[er]
;W[cr];B[eq];W[bo]
(;B[co]C[Jesse: This move lets White escape along the side (see variation).]
;W[bn];B[cn]C[Jesse: Watch out for empty triangles. There's almost always a better move (C7, C8 or tenuki for example).]
;W[cm];B[bp];W[cp]C[Jesse: B4 doesn't help matters much.];B[bm]
;W[bl]
(;B[cl]C[Jesse: If you want to give up B7, you could do it with D7 as well (see variation), Have more influence in the center and avoid the problems you run into later.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[em];B[bk]C[Jesse: Not a bad move for the left side, but White-E6 is dangerous.]
;W[en];B[fr];W[kq];B[kr];W[qe];B[qf];W[pe];B[re];W[oe];B[qd]
;W[rj]
(;B[ri];W[qj];B[qi];W[pj]C[Jesse: Again we see a black stone behind a row of three White stones. Perhaps the variation would have been better.]
;B[mn];W[kl];B[bg];W[bh];B[ch];W[bf];B[cg];W[cf];B[af];W[ae]
;B[ag];W[be];B[gj]C[Jesse: That was a nice sequence for Black, though the last move (G10) could be more forceful (G9, H9, bold souls might even go as far as tengen - Black needs to do something about the center).]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[eh];B[fh];W[el];B[ek];W[fk];B[fj];W[gk];B[ij]
;W[ki]
(;B[gm]C[dip: G7 was surely a kind of overplay, and following moves confirm that it was a bad idea. But in my opinion at this point B is behind a lot, so it should do something.
maybe H7 would work better.

Jesse: I can't always see too far, but it looks like H7 (see variations) isn't too good for black either. Maybe J8, K8, K9...]

;W[jj];B[kj];W[lj];B[jj];W[li];B[ng]C[Jesse: O12 would also work nicely.]
;W[rb];B[rc];W[am]C[Jesse: A fairly big gote-sente move (white has A9 to look forward to).]
;B[ak]C[Jesse: Exactly.];W[mm];B[nm];W[lm];B[nn];W[lp];B[mq]
;W[om];B[ok]C[Jesse: Nice peep.];W[pk];B[ol];W[oj];B[og];W[jh]
;B[hh];W[gp];B[gq];W[fp];B[mh];W[lh];B[mj]C[Jesse: This is a rather small gote move which is then abandonned to start another gote sequence. Remember the end game rule of thumb (first big sente then big gote then small sente then small gote). There are still big gote moves (D5) and many sente moves on the board for black (A8, H19, P17, H12, P5, M5, T6 etc.) play these first. If Black can play these one after the other (of course assuming that white doesn't find anything bigger), That can make several points of difference in the end game.]

Result: W+17.5

----
Jesse: I think both sides have played a nice game. I (just barely a single digit kyu) am not so sure that my comments have always been the most helpful. But I hope you can find some use in them. Feel free to write me if you have any questions. Perhaps we could play a game sometime too (jesssster or jcharles on KGS)

All the best, dip.

May the force be with you ;-)
