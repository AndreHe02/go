;W[qr];B[pp]C[as far as i know, this is not joseki (but i dont know many joseki) but i wouldnt call it a bad move. as white i would be thinking of keeping my stones together so would reply P3]
;W[rq]C[CZR: How should black respond here?];B[qp]C[as black, i would have considered P3, to give white a small corner and separate o4 from the corner. but i guess this is okish - as white i would be happy to see it and would reply P2; black will have to connect and white connects too as the variation shows.]

(;W[oq]C[this is ok but it gives black  sente move at s4]
(;B[pl]C[wrong.  too high for the side.];W[fq]C[nice answer]
;B[cj];W[jp]C[also nice, but notice white has played all his moves at the bottom.  if black now plays m16, he will have a nice framework]
;B[jd]C[good!];W[qk]C[thoughtless move.]
(;B[pk]C[CZR: Was this the right side to extend?  I'm hoping to form a big moyo in the center.
it looks ok to me; a picer is also possible. see variation.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[qi];B[oh];W[qe]C[looks too far];B[qg]
(;W[qd]TR[qh]C[awful, inviting black to separate]
(;B[qc]C[wrong thinking.  keep the enemy apart .see variation.]
;W[pe];B[od];W[oe]C[reckless. white should scrabble for life on the side instead.]
;B[rd]C[wrong direction.  keep white apart.];W[re];B[rc];W[rg]
;B[qh];W[rh]C[white breathes a sigh of relief!];B[pi]CR[qg]
[qh]TR[qo][pp][qp][qq]C[too slow and wrong direction.  the stones that count are the lower ones, not the two above]
;W[ql];B[qm]C[is it safe?  looks a bit unsafe to me];W[rm];B[pn]
C[nice move!];W[ec]C[yecch.  this is the same bad thinking as on the right side.  you need to cure yourself of this bad habit.  shoulder hit at, say D11 is meaningful, but this is not. it only heklps black.]
;B[dc]C[good!];W[gd]C[no comment.  pros make moves like this sometimes, but they know what they are doing.]
;B[hc]C[good!];W[gc]C[bad!!];B[gb]C[i dont like this move. it is simply trying to kill, not thinking about what happens when white runs out. better to hem white in, make him live small, and take large territories on the left side and the top.]
;W[ed];B[eb];W[df]C[interesting move; i wonder if you read it out - silly question - of course you didnt!  as a general principle, dont play a keima unless you know what will happen when it is cut.]
;B[ee];W[hd];B[ic];W[fe];B[ef];W[dg]C[oh boy....what about the stones above?]
;B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[id];B[je]LB[db:C][hb:A][jc:B][de:D]C[greedy. the cutting points may come back to haunt you.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[hb];B[ib];W[fb];B[ha]LB[db:A]
(;W[fa]C[greedy.];B[da];W[hf]C[good move, but white has suffered from his attempted invasion which has only strengthened black on the top and left]
;B[hg];W[if];B[kg]C[i dont like this move.  the lower middle is wide open.  better to play on the left side.]
;W[de]C[well, you have to try :)]
(;B[dh]C[oh oh, black forgot about his weak position in the top left]
;W[ea]C[premature, but probably will work, although the white stones have only 3 liberties, so as white i would tnow think about givng black the corner and trying to somehow make life on the side.]

(;B[db]C[thoughtless.];W[cd];B[cc]C[if black manages to live, i will give up Go]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[bf]C[good. vital point.]
(;B[cg]C[awful.];W[bg]C[necessary];B[bh]C[this move says: kill! kill! i wanna kill!!

this is no way to play Go.  take up roulette if you like staking everything on a quick kill.]
;W[cf]C[necessary];B[ag]C[black must defend his corner. this is pure nonsense.]
;W[ch];B[ci];W[ac];B[ab];W[ba];B[ad];W[ae];B[ah]
(;W[ig]C[what?? take the ko];B[jh]C[what??! the corner isnt settled yet.

to win a game of Go, you need a half-point lead.  you dont have to kill all the enemy stones.
