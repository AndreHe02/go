C[Hi! I played white in this game. I added some questions, remarks and variations.

Thankyou for any help!

pheno : Hi benni. I'll try to do my best analysing this game. I'll insist on basic principles more than on technical complications. The commentary is about both black and white's moves, and you can show it to your opponent if you like.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[op]C[pheno : Diagonal fuseki often leads to complicated and fighting games. So does the high move of p4. Well, you're white, after all, it is normal to look for complications!]

(;B[qp]LB[od:A]TR[qd][qp]C[pheno : I think this move is not urgent, and may be too low in conjunction with the r16 stone. If white gets a chance to play around A, black's right side will feel cramped. See variation.]
;W[pn]C[pheno : Good move, the real spirit of the takamoku (5-4) corner stone. Black is already low on the right side.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[np]LB[rn:A][ro:B]C[pheno : This simple joseki gives a nice thickness on the outside, and black gets the corner. Black can play at A now but it is a bit slow. If black neglects to play here, white can force anytime at A or B.]
;B[oc]LB[gq:A]TR[oc][pn]C[pheno : A shimari (corner enclosure) is always big in the opening, but white q6 nicely reduces its effectiveness. In fact the right side is not an interesting area anymore : black can't develop anything nice from his low position here.
Maybe a black move at A to reduce white thickness is better than the p17 move.]
;W[fq]TR[fq]C[is this move ok? white says after the game he found this an bad move. My idea was, that it works good with the 04 stones.

pheno : This move is a must, to develop the nice thickness you have on the right. Very good move.]
;B[hq]LB[cn:A][hq:B]SQ[pn][np][op][nq]C[pheno : This move goes against a basic principle of go : it is directed toward white's strength. To choose between A and B, look at the side where it is possible to have further development. Here A is correct. B is a jealous move, it will only create a target for white. The thickness is about to work!
In short, don't pincer when the opponent is strong on the side where you'd like to pincer. A pincer is an attacking move, and it is not a good idea to attack where the opponent is strong.]

(;W[cq]LB[fo:A]C[is the variation better?

pheno : yes, A is the correct way to punish black's overplay.]

(;B[cp]LB[dj:A]C[pheno : Black makes the final mistake in this area. This is the wrong direction. Remember to block on this side only when you already have an extension around A, else the wall you build won't work. See variation.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[go]C[pheno : White lives in sente so...]
;W[cj]LB[gp:A]C[pheno : This move is perfect. Black exchanged the corner for a wall which doesn't work. It might even become a weak group latter (there is a cut at A for instance).]
;B[kq]LB[fc:C][qj:A][rn:B]TR[pn][np][op][kq][nq]C[i thought this was a bad move from black. he has no territory and his influence is neutralized by c10. so i was happy here. black sayd after the game, that he played this move to weaken o4 stones.

pheno : This is indeed the wrong direction of play. White's group has a very solid shape, this is thickness, not a weak group. Approching thickness has no effect on the opponent, black only risks to become weak here. There are several big points better than black's move : A, B, C...
Of course the strength of the groups may vary during the game and eventually white will have to take care of his group but for the time being he is untroubled.]
;W[ro]LB[rn:A]C[i tryed to get a wall in sente, but it does not work.

pheno : s5 is an usual kikashi (forcing move) here, when black neglects to play at A.]
;B[rp];W[qo]LB[qi:A]TR[ro][rp]C[i think this move was bad. maybe i had to play around A instead. where exactly?

pheno : Good feeling, r5 is indeed heavy. s5 is a kikashi stone, that is a stone you exchanged for nothing (black s4 has no other purpose than defending against s5). So it can be discarded if needed. By trying to save this one stone you make it heavy. Kikashi stones are light.
A is indeed a first class spot, and the s5/s4 exchange juste raises its efficiency.]
;B[qj];W[nr];B[qr];W[rq]
(;B[sp]C[pheno : t3 is probably safer to make eye shape.];W[ps]
;B[qs]
(;W[sr]C[bad move again? see variation.

pheno : Yes, s2 looks better.];B[rr];W[oj]LB[jc:E][qh:D][nn:C]
[ko:B][kp:A]C[i played this to strengthen my o4 stones. but it ended with many secure territory for black. better ideas? A or B?

pheno : If you want to strengthen the group, C is proper shape. It seems slow but doesn't induce a reinforcement by black and later you can invade at D, pincering the r10 stone against the thick group.
But the white group is not so weak, it had a rather thick shape. So I suggest to take the big point of E instead of p10.]
;B[pj]LB[ph:A]C[pheno : This is quite slow, A is more usual.]
;W[oi];B[pg];W[ol]C[pheno : Now the white group is strong but at the cost of the initiative. The last big point is for black.]
;B[fc]
(;W[hc]LB[df:A]TR[oc][cj]C[pheno : White is pincering on a side where black is strong (because of p17). Moreover c10 is low and the wall white intends to build will not work so well. The simple move at A looks better than the pincer. (See variation.)]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge]
(;B[jc]LB[gd:A]C[pheno : Wrong direction. Black is playing from his strong side, no need to add a move here. The cut at A is small and white will happily discard a stone in such a strong black environment. See variation.]
;W[cm]LB[ej:A]TR[cm]C[pheno : Very good move, which weakens the black group and mitigates the threat of the cap at A.]
;B[ej];W[em]TR[ej][go][cp][dp][ep][hq][kq]C[pheno : Black is separated in two weak groups. White has good prospects.]
;B[gj]
(;W[fp]LB[gp:A]C[i think the cut was bad at this time. i got three stones but black was very strong in the outcome.
is the variation better? but i am way behind in territory, so maybe the game is allready lost?

pheno : The following sequence may lose the game indeed. Your variation is good. If you want to cut anyway, do this at A, it won't destroy your shape on the outside as in the game.]
;B[fo];W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[dn];W[co];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[bp]
;B[fm]TR[hc][cd][dd][ed][ge][cj][cm][em]SQ[ej][gj][fm][bn][cn]
[dn][en][fo][go][hq][kq]C[pheno : This sequence is terrible for white. He only captures three stones, whereas all his outside stones become weak! On the other hand, by discarding three useless stones, black makes the main part of his group very strong. Now the game seems promising for black.]
;W[dh];B[ef];W[fe]LB[fg:A]C[pheno : Playing on a dame (neutral point) like this is submissive, white can capture at A instead. Black should have play at A instead of this move, it is enough to win.]
;B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[fh]LB[je:A][ng:B]C[pheno : Very small move : it saves only one stone. A, or B are much bigger.]
;W[hp]C[now i realized, that i am behind and try something strange.

pheno : When you are behind, look for complications, indeed. However black is strong here and is untroubled.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[iq];W[io]C[pheno : White cutting stones have a weak shape, and black is thick, so it can't turn well for white.]
;B[jo];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[jl];W[ik];B[jk];W[ii]
LB[ij:A]C[pheno : This move leaves a cutting point, A is needed instead.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[jj];W[hi];B[ip]LB[hk:A]C[pheno : Useless move, the cut at A is a must!]
;W[ho]LB[gk:A]C[pheno : White must connect at A. He is separating two strong groups instead, this is useless.]
;B[hk];W[gk];B[hl];W[gi];B[fj]C[pheno : Now the game is clearly over.]
;W[fi];B[ei];W[eh];B[ci]LB[el:A]C[pheno : But black tries to capture more and may have problems. Just playing at A instead would take a safe win.]
;W[dj];B[di];W[gl];B[hm];W[ch];B[bj]LB[fl:A]C[pheno : Black hasn't got a lot of liberties and should simplify with something like A.]

(;B[dk]C[pheno : This cut doesn't look so good.]
(;W[gn]C[an error again. see variations. but maybe it does not help?]
;B[fn];W[ck];B[dl];W[dm];B[el]TR[cp][dp][ep]C[at this point i resigned. thankyou for your comments!

pheno : I didn't give a complete analysis of the last messy fight, it would need a lot of reading. But the fact is that after discarding the three stones for outside strength, black had an easy game and could have win without the complications of the end.

This game was interesting from the global viewpoint. Please remember not to pincer on a side where the opponent is strong (h3 and h17 moves). Try to develop on the most open side instead. Another mistake was to think the thick white group around p4 was weak : black wasted time in attacking it, white in defending it.]

(;W[bi];B[ai];W[fk];B[bi]LB[bk:B][bm:A]C[pheno : Well, the question is : can white do something by playing at A, or B? The throw-in indeed costs a liberty for black, but it doesn't seem to be very relevant here.]
))
(;W[fk];B[fj];W[gm]LB[ij:B][gp:A]C[pheno : Black has two weak groups and the threat of a cut at A, he may well lose something. White threatens A, or B, both being very severe.]

(;W[rr];B[sr];W[rs]LB[pp:A][qq:C][pr:B]C[seki?

pheno : Even locally dead. As A and B are miai, the liberty at C will have to be filled, and we have a dead shape. The problem is whether a black move at A threatens to escape (see the following moves).]

[np][op][kq][nq]C[pheno : Blocking from the correct side and calmly extending at l3 reduces white's thickness. White's stones seem almost useless here. So c3 was a mistake, but Black failed to punish it in the real game.]

(;B[oc]C[pheno : Enclosing the corner is more simple.];W[qp]
C[pheno : If white encloses too...];B[qj]TR[qj][qp]C[pheno : Black takes the ideal mutual extension point. So black has not to fear white's move at r4, and it is not urgent to invade here.]
