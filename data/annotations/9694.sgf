C[Hi Scaevola!

My name is Leandro and I'm a 7k player from Portugal.

13x13 is not my favourite board, but I'll try my best to help you.

The overview:

The game, as you said, was very peaceful. You followed B's moves, but, as it turned out, B's moves were also very calm and unobtrusive. In the end, you both just did a diagonal line across the board which B made one point larger. There were no fights and (almost) no life or death situations-.

I'll now give specific comments starting with LR.];B[kd];W[dk]
LB[cd:B][dd:A]C[LR: D3 is considered a not so good move (yes, I know, it is only the second move!), the reasoning is W is already pulling back from the opponnent. If B plays A or B, he's placing himself to push W one line further.

Note that this is only true for W. L10 is not a bad move for black, because he is one move ahead and can turn that move into an enclosure, for example, before W can do something severe.]
;B[cd];W[kj];B[gc];W[kf];B[cg];W[gk]LB[ic:A][id:B]C[Im guessing I should have shook things up a little more instead of playing defensively here.

LR: I guess so too. B didn't respond your approach, so you could go ahead now and invade. It would be good timing.

This is very important to remember: when you approach an opponent's stone, you are threatning something. Your opponent can do one of three things: he can answer the threat by protecting himslef or attacking your stone; he can make a threat of his own, as severe as yours; or he can ignore the threat and just take a big point. This last option is usually a bad idea, but in this game it was what B did. When your opponent ignores a threat of yours by just taking a big point, you should go ahead with what you were threatning.

A is a good place to invade, but I guess B would also be feasible but less agressive.]
;B[ci];W[ej]LB[ic:A][ei:B]C[LR: This is too slow.

The invasion at A is still possible, but even if you want to reply B's move, you should go higher, like B. D3 is already a very low stone. You need to expand from it as fast as possible.]

[gg][hg][dh][eh][fh][bi][ci][di][bj][cj]SQ[gi]C[I think i was just reacting to black's moves but I wasn't really sure what else to do

LR: The A invasion is still there, but now it is harder to play. Let's look at other options.

How is the board right now? For B, this diagonal works, so W14 is just playing what B wants. Also, it has a poor relation with  G5, and B can easily cut your stones by playing B.

Let's go back and see other options.];B[if]
(;W[hg]LB[hf:A]C[LR: the next moves just close the diagonal, but you could have started some fights. Here A was a move with a fighting spirit. Remember the Go proverb: Attach, Hane! http://senseis.xmp.net/?RespondToAttachmentWithHane]
;B[hf];W[cj];B[di];W[ke]C[LR

Touching stones like this just makes them stronger. K9 was a point to exploit.]

C[LR: this move just gave you one point! A or B were much bigger.]
;B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[lc];W[ec]C[this was me being desperate, I should have done something like this earlier but I am not sure when

LR: yes :)];B[dc];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[dj];W[ah];B[ag];W[ai]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[LR: hope some of my comments helped.

As usuall, I'm just a 7k player, so take everything I wrote with the proper grain of salt ;)

If you have any follow up questions, feel free to contact me.

Good games,
Leandro])
(;W[hf]C[LR: this would have shaken things up a bit.]))
(;W[ie]LB[if:A]C[LR: B wants to take half the board by making a diagonal wall, so you could deny him that and jump right in from a solid position. This breaks the simmetry and forces B to rethink his strategy. A was another option to do this.]
