AB[pd][dp]C[SigmaD [16k\]: rematch ..

RickMott: Review requested by SigmaD.

My main suggestion is to keep a whole-board focus and not get wrapped up in the local fighting.  Several times in the first huge battle in the lower left, you could have given up something small to get an enormous strategic advantage on the outside which would have let you win easily.

Also, do some life-and-death problems; you left some groups hanging which your opponent could have killed if he knew how.  You need to learn to spot potential eyespace problems ahead of time.  As you move up, you won't be able to depend on your opponent missing the attack.  Your reading skills need work.  They don't have to be hard problems to be useful, just do a lot of them to train your eye to spot typical situations.  "Go problems for beginners" is a good series, as is the "Art of Go" series from Yutopian.  I like these because they are organized thematically (cutting and connecting, etc.)  I think doing problems will improve your play faster than anything else at the moment.

Good luck!    (RickMott)];W[oq];B[dd];W[dq];B[eq]C[RickMott:  I think a hane from the inside, at the 3-3 point, might be better.  But you may not want to start a fight with the stronger player at all.  You could play a strong and simple move like C4.

In a handicap game, you want to take maximum advantage of your extra stones, so building strength facing your own stone is worth a lot.]
;W[ep]
(;B[fp]C[RickMott: Again, a hane from above (E5) pushing White to the right would be better.  You will build a position facing your 4th line stone.  See variation.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[dr]
(;B[fr]C[RickMott: Wrong direction, and doesn't pressure White's two stones.  You're building a position facing his stone instead of your own.

Either D5 (threatening a ladder) or C2 (threatening capture) is better.  You will sacrifice the E3 stone to build a position facing up along the left side.]
;W[cp];B[do];W[bq];B[bp];W[cr];B[co];W[cq];B[ap]C[RickMott: I would capture the two cutting stones E4-E6 in a ladder at E6 instead.   It doesn't matter if White captures B4; you'll get a strong outward-facing formation on both sides, which is worth more than White's small life in the corner.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[dn]C[RickMott: Now the ladder doesn't work and the fighting gets much more complicated, which favors White in a handicap game.]
;B[cn];W[aq];B[ao];W[er]C[RickMott: White B2 is better; it lives immediately and does not force Black to make a strong shape.]
;B[fq];W[fs]C[I could still have killed here right? Or am I missing something?

RickMott: No, you can't kill him.  If you throw in at E1, White should answer at the vital point B2 and can make two eyes.  If you play B2 immediately, White gets out with G2 and the resulting fight is unclear, but he can probably escape.

That would still be good for you, because you can press white down while he's struggling to make a second eye.

To avoid all this complication, White should descend at E1 instead of the hane.  Then he's alive for sure.  But he still would have been better off to play B2 several moves ago.]

(;B[gs]LB[es:B][gs:A];W[es];B[cs]C[RickMott: This is a mistake.  White should ignore you and play G2 to take your stone and get out.]
;W[bs];B[hr]C[RickMott: But he responds locally, so you get away with it... :)

Overall, this is a fine result for you.  Strong on both sides, with a weak group to chase between your strong ones.]
;W[fo]C[I guess I shouldn't have pursued this corner any more right now..]
;B[en]C[RickMott: Good idea, split White when you can.];W[dm]
;B[em]C[RickMott: Now you have ladders on both sides.];W[el]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[cl];W[gp];B[go]C[RickMott: Oops, this is a mistake.   Better to make a bamboo joint at H3.  You don't want to force white to atari you.]
;W[fn];B[fm];W[gn];B[ho]
(;W[jq]C[RIckMott: Phew.  White gives up too soon.  You're lucky; there's a sequence here which would give you a lot of trouble.  See variation.]
;B[hm]C[RickMott: The net doesn't work, because white has an atari at G7.  You have the right idea, but it should be a ladder with black G7.  If you do that, White almost has to resign.  It would be very hard to catch up.]
;W[gm];B[fl];W[gl];B[ek];W[fk];B[el];W[gq]C[RickMott: This doesn't work for white.]
;B[gr];W[hn];B[im]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Wrong extension.  You have to extend from your two weak stones at J5 instead.  Now White can capture your bottom stones.]

(;W[in]C[RickMott: Fortunately for you, white doesn't see the sequence.]
;B[io]
(;W[jn]C[RickMott: White misses another bet.];B[jo];W[jm];B[il]
C[RickMott: This can't be a good move.  You're making an empty triangle and your bottom stones still aren't secure.]
;W[jk]C[RickMott: White goes for the three stones, which is too small; he should attack your bottom group starting with blocking at L5.  Even if he doesn't kill it, he will make a big territory in the bottom right.]
;B[ik]
(;W[ij]C[Can J8 escape?

RickMott: The real question is, why do you care?  The J8 group is 8 measly points in the middle of the board.  There are enormously more valuable points everywhere, starting with making really, really sure your bottom group is alive. :)]

(;B[hj]LB[hj:A][jj:B];W[hk];B[jl]C[RickMott: Wasted move.   Save it for a ko threat.]
;W[kl];B[ko]C[RickMott: Excellent!  Now you've broken into white's moyo and he won't get a giant territory here.  Phew.]
;W[kp];B[jr];W[ir];B[iq];W[kr];B[is];W[lo];B[jp]C[RickMott: Unnecessary.  You already have two eyes.  Now your priority must be to constrain the size of white's bottom-right territory, maybe R3 or R4.  He is too far from the corner to hold it.  White should ignore this and play R4 himself.]
;W[kq];B[ln]C[RickMott: Wrong direction, and too close to white strength.  R4 still very important for both sides.]
;W[kn]
(;B[mo]C[RickMott: How about the other side?  See variation.]
;W[lp];B[nn];W[mp];B[np];W[nq];B[op];W[pp];B[pq];W[oo];B[no]
;W[qq]
(;B[pr]C[RickMott: White's atari is too aggressive.  You should take the double atari at Q5, let him capture, and extend toward the edge.  You'll get a nice right side.  See variation.]
;W[or]
(;B[po]C[RickMott: Consider the other atari, too.  See variation.]
;W[qp]C[Now I make a big mistake .. should have realized Q3 was dead.]
;B[os]C[RickMott: This should be at R5, and we'd be in the last variation I showed you which is favorable for you.]
;W[qr];B[ps];W[ns];B[pn]C[RickMott: Almost right, but you can afford to play R5.]
;W[qo];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[sn];B[sm];W[rp];B[ll]C[RickMott: You must protect the cut at R7.  It isn't secure, because after you atari white also gets an atari.  See variation.]

(;W[lm];B[mn];W[qm];B[ql];W[pm];B[on];W[rl]C[My opponent once again has read the situation a lot better than me ..
I didnt evn notice my weakness until now!

RickMott: yep.];B[rk];W[sl];B[pl];W[om];B[nl]C[RickMott: This is a very good move!  It protects your one-eyed group and starts to make a center-facing wall.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[lk];B[ml];W[km];B[jj]C[RickMott: I think you forgot your stones were in atari.

You need to start making some territory on the left or top.]
;W[hl];B[ii]C[Things are starting to look bad .. All I have going for me is my handicap stones above .. I don't think I realized that during the game though.

Still pretty much optimistic.

RickMott: Yes, but you have to stop playing right next to your opponent's stones and make some bigger moves.  The top is wide open for either side right now.]
;W[ik]C[RickMott: Fortunately, your opponent is following you, but a stronger player would leap at the chance to get a stone around K17.]
;B[kj];W[kk];B[lj];W[mk];B[nj]C[Idiot move!

RickMott: No, it's OK...];W[nk]C[Punished!]

;W[ni]C[White is cutting me like butter now .. How should I have kept this situation contained and still save O6?

RickMott: It's still OK for you.  Don't worry about a couple of stones.    Connect out and make territory in the upper right.  See variation.]

(;B[mj];W[oh];B[qg];W[ph];B[qf]C[RickMott: Ok, but not as much territory as the variation I showed you, and white has sente so you don't get to make the move at the top.  White should play around F17 now.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[od];W[nc];B[fj];W[gk];B[gj]C[RickMott: Good sequence.  You complete one wall of your moyo in the upper left.]

(;B[li];W[kh]C[Realize ladder will fail..]

;W[mi];B[hd]C[Desperately I do what I should have done much earlier ..
I guess I still want to beleive that is mostly my territory.

RickMott:  This is a good move, but you are so far behind now that it's very hard to catch up. and the remaining potential is not big enough.]
;W[jd];B[ic]C[RickMott: Small move.  You must play to hold the corner, maybe C16 or C14.]

(;W[ec]C[RickMott: wrong place.  Follow standard 3-3 invasion in the variation and do "score estimate".  White wins by 2.5 points.]
;B[ed];W[fc];B[gd]C[RIckMott: D17 to protect the corner is bigger, and you can attack the stones' eye space.  White's approach was not good.  He could just have invaded the standard 3-3 and probably gotten enough to win.]
;W[gc];B[hb]C[RickMott: D17 both reduces his eye space and protects your corner.  This just reduces his eye space.]
