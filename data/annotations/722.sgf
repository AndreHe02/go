AB[dd][dj][jd];W[jj];B[gk];W[kf];B[hd];W[jl]C[dada: so far nice moves of both sides :o)]
;B[kh]LB[cj:A][cf:B]C[dada: it is possible to play this invasion, but it will lead to heavy fighting.
Black should avoid fights in a handicap game.
Alternatives are A (c4) or B (c8)];W[jh]C[dada: correct];B[jg]
;W[ji];B[jf]LB[kg:A]TR[kf]C[dada: this has to be at A (l7). This way the marked W stone is cut off and the W group in the corner is not 100% alive.]
;W[kg];B[ke];W[lh];B[lf]C[dada: the outcome is still not too bad for B.]
;W[lg];B[ld]C[dada: I think this move is too small at this stage. The left side is more urgent.]
;W[ie];B[if]LB[je:A]C[dada: Why not at A (k9)?
(note that the cut at A will be a burden for Black for the rest of the game)]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[id];B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[hc];B[gc]C[dada: I think B is trying too hard ...
B has cutting points left all over the place
One proverb for handicap games is: "Stay connected!"];W[gd]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[gf];W[fe];B[hf]LB[fc:A][je:B]C[dada: impossible - W will cut at A (f11) and is alive.
Not only is this fight difficult, but what if B fails? W might be able to capture the B center stones after cutting at B (k9) (which indeed he did, as it will turn out).
You don't have to fight this hard in a handicap game - in most cases fighting is the cause of a white win. White's reading ability is better than B's, so only W is going to profit from a fight (in most cases).]
;W[he]C[dada: W misses the vital point];B[ee];W[fc];B[gb]LB[ed:A]
[ef:B][ff:C]C[dada: bad - you can't save this stone
Either connect at A (e10) or play from the outside at B (e8) or C (f8)]
;W[fb];B[ha];W[ga];B[ch]LB[cj:A]C[dada: good - maybe A (c4) is better, as it secures the corner 100%]
;W[cc];B[cd]C[dada: good - right direction];W[dc];B[bc]LB[ff:A]
[je:B]C[dada: too small, as it is gote
Better to protect the lower left corner, or play at A (f8) for the center.
Note that a White play at A is more or less sente because of the cut at B (k9).
Therefore W is able to lay waste to B's center moyo (potential territory).]
;W[bb];B[bd];W[ck]C[dada: this hurts];B[dk];W[cj];B[cl];W[bl]
;B[dl];W[bm]
(;B[cm]C[dada: ????
What's the purpose of this move?
See variation for a better way to play.];W[ci];B[di];W[bh];B[bg]
;W[cg]
(;B[bf]LB[dh:A]C[dada: WRONG!!!
This has to be at A (d6) - see variation.];W[dh]C[dada: ouch
At this point the game is lost for Black.
The groups on the upper left and lower side have to make life and meanwhile W will expand his territory.]
;B[kk]C[dada: dangerous - W might try to kill the upper left group ...]

(;W[kj]LB[jk:A]C[dada: W is too cautious - connecting at A (k3) is better.
But actually attacking on the left is the right way - see variation]
;B[jk];W[ik];B[il];W[kl];B[ij];W[hk]C[dada: bad - this is only helping Black to fix the shape]
;B[hj]C[dada: good];W[hl];B[gl];W[im];B[gm]C[dada: again too small - you should play on the left instead.]
;W[gh];B[cf];W[df];B[de];W[ef]
(;B[be]C[dada: painful, but necessary
See variation.];W[je]TR[gm][if]MA[df][ef]C[dada: painful - this is a direct consequence from playing at g1 earlier instead of strengthening the left side.
Because the left B group was weak, W was able to surround it in sente (marked moves) and now reaps the profit of the attack.
This is to show that even groups which are alive (like the B group on the left) can be exploited.
Defending is not only about making eyes.
Note that capturing the center stones was made possible by playing at j8 instead of connecting (early in game) in the first place.]

(;B[ag]C[dada: not necessary - see variation
This is a 'lost' move - the lower side is more urgent.];W[ah]
C[dada: W is too nice];B[ab];W[ba];B[fj]LB[gj:A][gi:B]C[dada: the solid connection at A (g4) looks better, as it doesn't give W the forcing move at B (g5) next.]
;W[gi]
(;B[ej]LB[gj:A]C[dada: should be at A (g4). There's nothing to worry about - see variation.]
;W[gj];B[el]C[dada: not necessary - see previous variation]
;W[hm];B[mg];W[mh];B[mf];W[li];B[ia];W[ed];B[fk]LB[eh:A]C[dada: unnecessary - this only loses points. Should be at A (e6) instead.]
;W[eh];B[tt]LB[fi:A]C[dada: Pass?
The game is not yet finished - Black should play at A (f5).]
;W[fi]C[dada: W wins by a huge margin.
Black showed some unsteady play - sometimes very good, sometimes very bad.
The main reason for B's loss was of course the fighting.
In a handicap game in 9 out of 10 cases W will profit from a fight. That's why W will seek and jump on any fight that develops. Black on the other hand should avoid fighting like the plague. Especially the early invasion and the futile attack on W's stones on the upper side lead to B's eventual loss. To me it looked like B wanted everything - denying W any points if at all possible. However, Go is a game of "give and take" and it's only natural that W will get some territory as well. You don't have to have the "all is mine" attidtude. Give White what is white's and you will get your share as well. This is the road to victory.

Remember: if you win by only 1 point - you win! There's no need to win by 100 points.]

But while doing so B will make no territory whatsoever. White will push Black around and gain point after point.
B's situation is hopeless.])

C[dada: W can't get two eyes any more, as this move makes A (b3) a false eye]
;W[ci];B[bg];W[di];B[fi]C[dada: As far as I can see this move should contain White and therefore kill the group.
But it's a hard fight. And in a handicap game it is likely that W will succeed and live with this group.
Then B would be in trouble as the group on the bottom might need to make life.]
