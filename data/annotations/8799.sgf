C[Hello, I'm da9304, 6k in KGS !


I felt bad after this game.  I think I have been to nice to black during the chuban, when I could have attacked him stronger. Finally, I won by destroying his corner territory because of his missread.

I would have your opinion espacially on those two points : fuseki and middle-game (the way I should have attacked black).

Thanks ! :)

Hi, 

This is Wonodan from KGS.

My EGF ranking is 4-kyu, and the strongest solid rank I've achieved in KGS is 3d.

I will begin my comments with W.

Let's have fun. :-)];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[fq];W[pe]C[I thought attacking 3-4 point was more important than aswering F3-approach.

W: It's hard to tell which is more important, I often play this way too. Sometimes it's good not to play as your opponent expects you to play. :-)]

---

W: Yes, I feel there are now too many weaknesses. Black is not yet closed in the corner. He can get out with Black 1, White 2, Black 3 or he can simply attach at A or cut at B. You must not leave weaknesses in the opening stage, because they will hunt you down from the middlegame to the endgame.]

---

W: If you play O3 here, black will give atari at O7, and start attacking your group which isn't 100% alive yet. This mvoe makes sure you're not getting into any trouble later, which is why it's good.]

There are two things I think you should need to keep in mind, moving out (avoiding getting surrounded) and fixing weaknesses early (to fight and avoid getting attacked).]

1) You make a base.
