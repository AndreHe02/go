C[Greetings!

My name is Matt Puumala, and I'm playing at about the 20k level on the Dragon Go Server. In addition to lessons learned directly from this game, I am interested in learning more about what I need to learn. That is, what book ( or section of Sensei's Library) should I read next? If there are aspects of this game that give hints about my weaknesses, please point them out!

This game was played on the Dragon Go server, over the course of three months. So, if there seems to be a lack of "flow", that may account for it...

Thank you for your time in looking at this game, and I look forward to learning from your comments!

*Hello! I'm Wojtek Jedynak, 8k EGF from Poland. I play as wjzz on KGS, so if u have any doubts about my comments, or smt is still not explained propelly tell me or e-mail me! 
This is good game to explain some things, but in some places, i wasn't able to tell you what the proper move should be, so instead i showed you may thoughts on the current situation. I hope u will like this comments!]

(;W[pf]TR[rd]C[matt: Too aggressive? E16 or C10 instead?

*Imo this is 
1. played too soon
2. it helps your opponent and strenghtens him. Why? Because this is a contact move. Contact moves should be played when you are weak and while defending. They aren't to be used to attack.

If you want to play in the upper right corner, i think S16 is the move. It gives you the whole corner.]

(;W[eq];B[dq]
(;W[hq];B[mp];W[eo];B[dn]C[Right now, your stones look weak. You should add another move avoid problems. I think L3 is good enough]

(;W[cj]C[This move seems to be too loose. You dont have a stone at E16 od E17 yet and you are weak at the bottom. If you play komoku, first play E17 (16) and enclose the corner, then extend.]
;B[cf]C[matt: Since this move caused me anxiety, I deduce that C10 was premature...? E16 first?

Yes. Black is strong, and now you are faced with a hard position I mean, a difficult fight is starting.]
;W[ec];B[di]C[Now it looks like white is outnumbered :( I will show you some posible sequences]

;W[df]TR[cj][dk][dl][fl][dm]SQ[eo][fo][eq][hq]C[Bad! Why? Both the Triangled and the Squared stones are weak. They may die at every moment so you have to start looking after them.]
;B[dg];W[de];B[ci];W[qn];B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp]C[matt: Sorry you had to see this...]
;B[rq];W[rn];B[sp];W[ql];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd]LB[jd:A][ri:B]TR[cj]
[dk][dl][fl][dm][eo][fo][eq][hq]C[Ok, let think about the situation so far.
White has two strong groups at the top and a move around K16 ('A') would be perfect

Black group in the upper right is strong but its worth much territory, since white's B is very big and urgent! S11 would give white a solid position and also some amount of territory so i recomend playing it as fast as possible.

Black group at the bottom is very strong and gives his alot of territory. 

Black group in the left bottom is also strong and attack both marked groups, so i guess i would let black play S17 and took care of the weak groups.]

(;W[rc];B[gd];W[jc];B[je];W[gc]TR[gb]C[matt: At this point, I felt good about grabbing narrow territory across the entire top...

Again, a contact move. This helps your opponent! g18 is better!]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[fd];W[lq]C[matt: This invasion turns into unmitigated tragedy. Is there something I should do first? A different approach to the attack?

This is premature. You can play like this when you are strong nearby. Unforunately, you arent :(]

;W[gn];B[fm];W[kn];B[oe];W[io]C[matt: Proper to make connection and sacrifice P15, Q15? It seemed much larger to me.

Very good, you managed to connect the two gropsQ15 is sooooo small. it's just 4 points!]

TR[me][ri][bj][rj][hr][cs]C[matt: Again, knowing that I was going to lose ~4 in the corner, I chose to disrupt in the center. It felt bigger, but I can't put a value on it, even now. Was this a good choice?

Yes. look for big plays, dont worry about your opponets moves is there are just bad.

I marked with triangles the places where you should try to play as soon as possible.]

I would start with L11 but S10 is very big! C1 is a must to play, shince its sente!B10 is also big!]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[mi]C[matt: Setting up option to cut L12 from K10, or L12 from N13.]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[ki];W[hj];B[hi];W[hk];B[lk]C[matt: I agonized at this point, and came to the conclusion that I was either going to lose M10-N12 or J11. This was my last-ditch try-to-save-the-game ploy, and it didn't work. *sigh*]

ok. i think you lost because you made two weak groups and could have played better in the yose. On the other hand you took alot of territory at the top and managed to connect the two weak groups. I think you should read Otake Hideo's book "Opening Theory Made Easy". It's a cool book, helps alot. Another book i liked is "Attack and Defence" by Jamies Davies and Akira Ishida. The latter may seem tough but is worth reading. Also Graded Go Problems volumes 2 and 3 by Kano Yoshinori are great! Ok, i hope i helped you!]
