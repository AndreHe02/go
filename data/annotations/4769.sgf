AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I can see the small mistakes I made thru the game, but it seems that even if I hadn't made them I would have lost.
Even if had not lost the group in the lower right after the ko (move 216), black would be behind.
How did white get so much territory and black lost his initial handicap advantage? That I cannot see.

Thanks in advance for the review!

catch22: Hi, I'll be reviewing your game. I hope that you'll find my comments as useful as I found the game interesting.]

;W[qj]
(;B[qk]TR[qh]C[catch22: This is not a good move. A contact move tends to make the stone it touches stronger, and should therefore be used with care. It can for instance be used to help your own stones make shape when they are in trouble, or to make your opponent's stones heavy before attacking them. Here neither applies and you end up hurting your marked stone without gaining much in return. 

There is no need to worry about your stones at the bottom right yet. A better strategy seems to keep White's stones separated. See the variation.]

(;B[jd];W[cc];B[de];W[ed];B[gc];W[bd];B[ee];W[gd]C[catch22: This looks to be an overplay by White. The proper move by White is probably just to play F16.]

(;B[hd]C[catch22: Why not prevent White from getting out by playing F16? The variation seems to punish White's overplay effectively.]
;W[ge];B[he];W[fc];B[fe];W[fd];B[dj];W[qc];B[qd];W[qe];B[pc]
;W[qb]C[catch22: This looks like another overplay by White. White should probably have played at S18 instead.]

(;B[cq]C[catch22: Black could punish White's overplay in the top right instead. See variation.]
;W[lc]C[catch22: I find it difficult to see if this is an overplay by White, or not. If there is a weak spot in the black, this seems to be it.]

(;B[md]C[catch22: This move is lacking a bit of force. See the variation for a different way of playing.]
;W[ic]
(;B[jc]C[catch22: Letting White play at H17 is a loss for Black. Black should therefore consider blocking at H17. See variation.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib];B[kc]C[catch22: This is a good result for White. He has enlarged his territory at the top, and reduced Black's territory to virtually nothing.  There are a lot of Black stones at the top, but they are not doing much. They hardly enclose any territory, and their influence is largely negated by the white stones at the right, and the fact that White can still pop through at G14.]
;W[lb];B[ka];W[ld];B[le];W[na];B[mb];W[ke];B[kd];W[gf]
(;B[jq]C[catch22: It is tempting to play here, as it is the only remaining big open space. However, I am not sure if it is good to play here directly. It pretty much forces White to jump into the bottom right corner, at S3, which is a point that Black would like to play himself. It may be better for Black to play there directly. See variation.]
;W[qq];B[qp]TR[pp][qn][qk][pk]C[catch22: It is hard for Black to ignore White's move, but he should not be happy about the result. The five black stones are too close together to be efficient.]
;W[gq]C[Up to this point I was pretty confident about my moves, but I didn't know how to answer to the invasion a g3.
I thought about g5 and h3, but in the end I prefered k3.

catch22: Jumping out at K5, as in the game, is hardly ever wrong in situations like this where it is difficult to create a base along the side. It also seems to be the best move in this case. See the variations that follow for my thoughts about the other two moves.]

(;B[jo];W[go];B[jm];W[ip];B[iq]C[catch22: Why not simply connect? Because you have already jumped out to K7, it is a bit strange to let these stones be cut off now.]
;W[jp];B[hp];W[ho];B[gp];W[io];B[fq];W[kq];B[hq];W[ko];B[jn]
TR[jo]C[catch22: This move is not good. There is no point in saving the marked stone. It does not serve a purpose anymore. It is not a cutting stone. White is already connected to his group at the bottom right. So all that this move does is give Black a heavy chain of three stones to look after. Black should have played elsewhere instead of wasting a move.]
;W[ln];B[oj]TR[ln]C[catch22: What is the purpose of this move? It only invites White to play the move he would like to play anyway (S10), whereas it is unclear what Black gets in return. Because of the White marked stone, Black cannot effectively create center influence here.]
;W[rj]TR[qh]C[catch22: This is the move that White has wanted to play for a long time. It reduces the bad aji associated with the marked black stone, and is territorially big as well.]

TR[mq][mp][lp]C[catch22: It seems premature by White to play here. He should probably have played N2 to make sure of the capture of the marked black stones.]
;B[mr]C[catch22: Good.];W[kp];B[oq];W[hf]C[catch22: White is trying to surround the center, but this is a risky strategy. If Black plays P2 now, he gets a lot of points in the bottom right. It will not be easy for White to compensate for this in the center, as Black can still reduce the center territory by quite a bit.]

(;B[ps]C[catch22: Black has an even better move. See variation.]
;W[qs]C[catch22: White should probably have played at N1 instead.]

(;B[op]C[catch22: Not good. Black can still play N1 and capture the entire corner.]
;W[ms];B[ns];W[nr];B[dm]TR[cf][de][ee][fe][cd]C[??? Was this a good move?

catch22: I think it would be slightly better to play at C7 instead, as this results in a more balanced position. Because the stone at D10 is at the fourth line, the black position would be stronger if this stone is at the third line. As it is, I don't think the left side is entirely certain territory for Black yet. White may still be able to pull something off here, starting with for instance C10. This could work because the marked Black stones are fairly weak.]
;W[lf]TR[ld][lc][lb]
(;B[je]C[Would N15 be better? I though my answer at K15 was without thinking and weak...

catch22: Yes, I think N15 would have been slightly better. See variation.]
;W[me];B[ke]C[catch22: The mere fact that Black has ended up with an unshapely large clump of stones, means that I would rather have played at N15 instead of K15. On top of that, White is now also able to enlarge his territory at the top right.]

;W[ih];B[ri]C[This was a mistake I noticed right after I played - should have been T10 instead of s11?

catch22: Yes, T10 is better than S11, as Black is now just giving points away. Although T10 is only an endgame play, it is quite big, as White has to respond, and it prevents White from playing T9. 

An interesting question is whether or not Black can even afford to play either T10 or S11 now.  White may not respond, but play J14 instead, which seems to kill the black stones at the top.]

(;W[sj];B[if]C[catch22: A narrow escape.];W[ig];B[jh]C[catch22: What's the point of this move? White is happy to respond at K11, whereas the black stone at K12 does not have any purpose. You should only play like this if the cut works, which is not the case here.]
;W[ji];B[ii]
(;W[hi]C[catch22: White decides to capture the cutting stone, which works but is maybe a little bit difficult to read out. However, before Black played K12, he should at least have read out the simpler sequence shown in the variation. As a result, Black should never have cut in the first place.]

catch22: R7 is not a mere reduction of territory. The intention is to also threaten the black stones. So you have to be confident you can handle the consequences of ignoring the ko threat. 

Whether or not you can afford to ignore the ko threat is difficult to read out here. So you may be better off responding to the ko threat, as there is so much at stake.]

(;W[pn]C[catch22: At first sight, this looks like a bit of an overplay by White, but it may have been a pretty good move. Simply playing P7 does not get White very far. See variation.]

;B[hi];W[gh]TR[jh][ii][hi][ji][ij]C[This simple variation should be enough for Black to discard the cut. 

If you consider the last six moves, none of the three black stones are doing anything useful. The cutting stones would be valuable if the cut is valuable, but it is not. Both White groups are already very strong. 

The three white stones, on the other hand, are all pretty useful. The stone that White played last not onlythreatens to capture the black cutting stones, it also makes the Black stones at the top left look very weak. If Black is not careful, these may all be captured. The other two stones help White surround a bit of center territory, and also pretty much completes the capture of the three Black stones below.]
