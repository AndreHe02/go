C[Hello and thank you for reviewing my game. In this game, 
I thought I was winning through most of it because of my 
moyo forming in the center. I don't know what happened. What did I do wrong?
I was Black in this game.

GP: Hello, I'll do my best to pick up on the key points 
as I see them :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]
C[My first thought was to play at k4, but I decied to change 
my mind.  Was this a mistake?

GP: No, this is fine. K4 is fine too. Normally after this wC3 bJ3 and both sides can be happy. As White tenuki'd Black is also free to tenuki - bC3 is a big followup for later if you get the chance.]
;W[qo];B[qm];W[oo];B[np];W[pl]TR[pm]SQ[ql];B[pm]SQ[ql]C[GP: R8 is normal. White can play R8 now and the fighting is complicated.]
;W[om];B[ql];W[pk]C[GP: After R8, Q7 is normal for Black - so by this point you have returned to a standard joseki. Everything fine so far.]
;B[qk];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi]TR[pn]SQ[qh];B[pn]SQ[qh]C[Was this correct or should I have played at R12?

GP: R12 is definitely correct. You don't need to fear White playing here at this point.]
;W[on];B[po];W[op];B[oq];W[pp];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[ro]
;W[nq]TR[mq]SQ[nr]
(;B[mq]SQ[nr]C[GP: This is a tragic mistake! The difference between Black having the corner and White having the corner is very big (see variation).]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[or]TR[mp]SQ[iq]C[I am so glad that he didn't read out the cut at n4.  Luck 
was on my side :D.

GP: I don't think there is any value in the cut for White. O4 itself is a small stone and it isn't a cutting stone with P3 dead. This is better for White than making the cut.]

(;B[mp]SQ[iq]C[GP: Very heavy, now you have stones with no base that must be looked after. This is only good if you really need to protect that cut. In this case, if White decides he wants to cut, Black can profit anyway, so better to establish both lower black groups.]
;W[qh];B[ri]C[GP: Good.];W[og];B[nd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc]
;W[rb];B[qb];W[rc]TR[ic]SQ[kc];B[ic]SQ[kc]C[Do you think this was too far away?  What move would you reccomend?

GP: This feels too far for me, simply because White is very thick below, solid in the top right, and neither of Black's groups will be secure after a White invasion around L17 or M17. However, the corner was well played generally.]
;W[cg]TR[fo]SQ[cq][iq];B[fo]SQ[cq][iq]C[I made this move with the intention of making a moyo.  Do you think that a reduction at around c10 or D10 would work because I lost this game because My opponent made so much territory on the left side.

GP: It's not really a moyo yet - another reason why J3 early would have been a nice point to have taken. C3 is locally bigger in this area, and if you would like a moyo J3 is still good. Never underestimate the value of making your groups completely settled!]
;W[cq];B[fc]C[Was this good?

GP: Yes, this is fine. It removes the dangers of White invading around L17/M17 and challenges the corner.]

(;W[dc]C[I don't know why white didn't kick me here.  Was this a too defensive move ir is there something more behind it?

GP: White wants a big corner -- lots of points here with this move! There's no real benefit to wF16 or wE17 (see variations). This removes almost all the dangerous corner aji, and gives White an easier job of capping F17 without the risk of a counterattack.]
;B[lm];W[em]CR[ci][cl]TR[gm]SQ[df][eg][dh]C[I think this is where I really started sliooing up becuase that is a strong move since it is reducind my moyo and gaining him territory.  What are your thoughts?

GP: White is very loose with regards to points on the left hand side. Key invasion points require lightness. Capping or shoulder hits on a third line stone are likely to be effective, and there's a perfectly placed stone to approach. It is important for Black not to try C11 or C8 as White will simply profit from chasing out the poor White stone.]

(;B[gm]SQ[df][eg][dh];W[fk];B[fe]C[I think this is my sad attempt at trying to reduce this.  As I look at it right now, would a move at E 11 be good?

GP: E11 is a bit wishy-washy for my liking. It's not really directly threatening anything, and White gets to pick how he wants to play it. I'd still go with the shoulder-hit at D12.]
;W[gd]C[Helsbecter [6k\]: since july
artboy598 [6k\]: cool];B[fd];W[eg]C[White eventually got all of that territory :(.]
;B[gf]C[GP: Understandable, but slow. E13 netted White a lot of points as you noticed. How many does this really gain Black? It hasn't removed much of the aji of the G16 stone, and it's not really picking up much territory. Taking gote here is very costly!]
;W[rh];B[gh]C[After this I thought that I was starting to make a comeback.

GP: This isn't a bad move, but it feels slow. If this was the last nail in a 60 point territory at the top, then great. As it is, White can reduce it very heavily from his thickness on the right hand side.]
;W[hk];B[il];W[mf];B[le];W[fi];B[lf];W[lg];B[kg];W[lh]C[GP: Not only has this reduced Black, it also threatens to make points for White.]
;B[lk]C[Should this have simply been at L12?

GP: Yes :) You really want to avoid the shape White gets bending around a single stone like that - at best you'll probably give White a lot of sente chances to either build points or cut and attack.]
;W[kh];B[jg];W[jh];B[gj]C[GP: Again, after wJ13 there's some very nasty aji left. "Hane at the head of two stones" is a common term, and it's got good reasons. In this case you are letting White hane at both heads of the two stones, which can become very destructive locally.]
;W[fj];B[gk];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij];W[ig]C[GP: This is a bigger gain for White than losing H9.]
;B[if];W[me];B[ld];W[md];B[mc];W[kf]C[I think there was another move white could have done to cause alot more trouble.  What about you?

GP: It's hard, there's a lot of bad aji here certainly];B[je]
;W[jf]TR[ke]SQ[ie];B[ke]SQ[ie]C[GP: J15 better shape, as White can't successfully push and cut here.]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[hg];B[he];W[gg];B[ef];W[df];B[fg]C[This move is pointless to me now.  I think C2 would have been WAY bigger than that.

GP: This move is very slow. If you get a response, tenuki ;)]
;W[fh];B[ff]C[GP: Still C2 would have been bigger than this.]
;W[cr]C[see what I mean?];B[eb];W[db]TR[sq]SQ[da]C[GP: You've got a response, follow it up in sente.]

(;B[sq];W[rr];B[qf]C[GP: Q18 is bigger. Although this gives danger to the corner, it is only dangerous when White cannot capture R18. R18 is 6 point gote (though arguably, as White will probably want to play R15 to prevent serious reduction), and allows you to take S19 as a futher useful endgame gote move.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa];B[oa]C[GP: You want to avoid this move unless you can solidly read disaster. At this stage in yose you want to be pushing sente every move. D19 is big, as is T2.]

TR[nl]SQ[nj]
(;B[nl]SQ[nj]C[GP: Don't play the cut, just play O10. You have a double atari if White cuts back, and you allow yourself to push later at N7 if White connects at O8 (though obviously N11 first is urgent).]

C[Don't even talk about this move.  I thought there was a stone at O15 and was yet again hasty. lol.]
;W[sq]C[artboy598 [6k\]: oops];B[tt];W[tt]C[Well the game is over.  What should I look for in my play?  What should I study?  The books I have currently read are: Go! More than a game, Opening theory made easy, and Janice Kim's Learn to Play Go series.  Any recomendations that you think I should read based on what you have seen in this game?  Again, Thanyou for the review! :D

GP: Firstly, fill in the dame!! At makes no difference in this game, but White should only have one point at K13 / L13 and no points at P8. Simply pushing at K11 and making the atari with O15 will pull two points off White for no cost. (K13/L13 is reduced to 1 point because after the dames are filled, Black has a snapback with K13).

Ok, in summary:

1) Settle your groups before thinking about moyo building. Moyos are supposed to be light frameworks that invite invasions, not solidly built central territory. For one thing, if your opponent gets jealous and tries to dive in, you've got the strength to fight back and not risk getting a group cut in half. White moves such as D17 are strong precisely because it suddenly gave Black's no weaknesses to exploit.

2) Invasions and reductions seem to be a weak point. Neither your fighting nor your shape seem particularly bad, and you didn't make any big life and death errors either.

3) Yose: Never play gote unless it is all that is left or worth over 10 points. If you can't find anything sente, look for your opponent's sente moves and play there instead (where it is "reverse sente", not "gote"). A good rule of thumb is take the gote value of a yose move and double it if it is reverse sente.

Without any question, if you don't have it and / or haven't read it, I think you would benefit from "Attack and Defence" from the Elementary Go Series (Book 5) by Ishida and Davies: briefly speaking it covers how to attack, how to reduce, how to probe, and how to come up with a sound mid-game strategy.

I hope that helps, and do feel free to ask me any questions that you may have about my comments!]
