;B[pp]C[odif [5k\]: Dear reviewer,I played white in this game against a 6k, my opponent played low chinese,I would like to know if My Fuseki was reasonable, I failed to find an effective way to attack his 2 weak groups on the top. I think my worst move was at move 60, This lived his top right at great expense to my stones.

were my stones too overconcentrated after the fuseki?

Can you tell me if you think some of my stones were inconsistant with what had already been played?

I thank you for taking the time to look at my game


AP:  Your stones were a little bit too overconcentrated after the fuseki, but it wasn't too bad, D13 was a poor fuseki choice in my opinion, and while D10 is fine, I prefer to approach the chinese opening at R6.  Your main problem is moves like J5 which force your opponent to get solid territory, if you could avoid that, you would improve a lot.]
;W[qd];B[cp];W[dd];B[iq];W[dj]C[Odif:If I played Q 10,would that be better, or R6 hoping for black 04 white Q 10
Is P 17 too slow];B[od]C[Odif: Is it good for black to play here immediately in this fuseki pattern]
;W[pf]C[Odif:maybe I didnt spend enough time on this move, I also thought of a pincer arround k16, or a play at  p17 or r14. this Q14 stone was played with a hope of later making something on the right hand side. If I already had a a stone at k16, then this would probably be more effective]
;B[qc];W[rc];B[pc];W[re];B[lc];W[qi]C[Odif:  Was this move bad here,if I had played at q10, I could play at R 6 later making a big side. It is maybe too slow here, a move on top is possibly more urgent. Or can I approach at E4 now.

AP: A bit too close, R11 isn't too bad, but R10 is probably a bit better.]
;B[cl]
(;W[dg]C[Odif: Is this a reasonable way to play, the black opening looks much better, I wanted to keep my stones linked.

AP: I would play at E4 to try to cut down on his moyo before he builds it up, connecting your stones isn't your first priority at this moment.  See variation for E4]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[ic]C[Odif: My upper left stones are a bit thin and my corner is open, so maybe not right time to play here, it just seemed natural though, I was scared that I would lose if  I let him get too much here

AP:  You definitely have the right idea here, but I would try J16, seems to work better, it leaves him without a great response.]
;B[ie];W[jd];B[ff];W[eb];B[fb];W[le]C[AP:  Try K15 instead, keeps the pressure up, he doesn't have life yet.  M15 gives him forcing moves to make easy life]
;B[je];W[kd];B[of]
(;W[pe]C[Odif:I feel this is too slow, maybe just jump out to k 13. Up till now I have played all my stones on the top half of the board, are my stones too overconcentrated.

AP: try P13 instead, you need to get control of the game so you can escape with your m15 stones, see variation.  Black can make a more threatening move like n14 and put pressure on your stones.]
;B[oe]C[Odif:great I have just given him a wall facing my eyeless group at L 16. and I also lose the possibility to play kikashi at 015 later]

(;W[ep];B[bj];W[do];B[co];W[dm];B[cm]
(;W[io]C[AP: This move doesn't take advantage of your wall on the left, it just builds his territory, try a move at N3 to break up his territory rather than build it, see variation.]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[kp];W[pn];B[ho];W[hn];B[go];W[cn]C[AP:  This move just gives black strength, opt for G6.]

C[Odif:The C10 stone hurt, and I am still reeling from the blow,but this move feels bad


AP:  B12 is the right idea, but it lets black have a move at c11, opt for c11.]
;B[ko]C[Odif: ouch again. My h6 group looks a bit lost out there.]
;W[mc]C[Odif: now I just ruin everything with this move.Or maybe it was just the follow up.

AP: This move was bad, but not as bad as you think, it solidified the cut at m14, opt instead for a move at R4]

;B[qo];W[pm];B[oq];W[ge]C[AP:  The attack looks natural, however, you dont end up profiting much from it and you cannot kill, so try a move at P13 to gain territory.]
