AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer, I am Kurato1 (not solid 8k on KGS)

It was a seanse game in russian game room on KGS (my opponent simmultaniously played with 14 kyu players).
I am very interesting in handicap games and looking for advices, which could help me in other hadnicap games.
There is some comments in the game tree with my questions about the situation.

Also i would like to know where black could play tennuki?

Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english!

Hi, this is Wonodan from KGS.

I will start my comments with W:

I hope I can answer most of your questions with satisfactory accuracy. : - )

Common rule in big handicap games (6-9 stones) is to try to connect your stones.

White's strategy would be to cut as many of these connections as possible.

In this case, if you can connect all your 6 stones in to one big living group, chances of losing are minimal.

Don't forget to check all the variations, I did not use "Label Variations" tool because I used letters A, B etc... a lot.

;W[dh]C[W: This is an overplay, but in a big handicap game White needs to play such moves to create chaos. The stronger player loves chaos in a handicap game. : - )]

White groups A and B both have 2 eyes, no matter what you do.

The Black group C is alive no matter what White does.

So certainly, this move at 170 was unnecessary. It's not even very big considering the endgame.]

;W[lk];B[kl];W[ho];B[hn];W[in];B[ep];W[gp]C[W: White's move is a big mistake, or a silly overplay.

Don't rush to connect just because three meaningless stones are in atari. Be rational and calm.

If you connect here, you gain 13 points.

If White captures here, he gains 6 points, and you lose 6 points, so this is worth around 19 points.

And the corner? White has 8 points, and if you capture the corner White loses 8 points and you gain 28 points, a total of 36 points.

Attacking the corner is more profitable for you, than saving the three stones.]
