C[This game was played by myself, "zenjutsu" (13k* on IGS) and
"aah" (12k* on IGS).  I play black and I won the game by 3.5
points.  I feel that I was losing the entire way through the
game, and I miscounted and misplayed many key capturing races.
I appreciate any and all commentary, advice, insight, etc from
the reviewer.  I have attempted to indicate what my thoughts
were when making various plays, and where I have specific questions.
Thank you for taking the time to review my game.];B[pp];W[pc]
;B[cp];W[cd];B[iq];W[ic]C[TJ: It's normal to approach either at D7 or R6 to start trimming black down in quite an aggressive way. Straightforward moyo-building contests usually favour black, since he is a move ahead.]
;B[cj];W[qj];B[cg]C[This stone is too small, right?

TJ: It looks pretty reasonable to me.];W[qn];B[on]C[I'm not certain this was the best response.  However, this particular
stone turned out to be one of the few stones that I looked back
at and said "phew, good thing I played that one".  It just happened
to work out that way in this game.

TJ: I like P6 very much because it is a dual-purpose move - it threatens violence against the R6/10 structure while building up on the lower side.]
;W[eq];B[dq]C[I'm actually somewhat happy with the D3, E4, D6 sequence.  However,
should I have played differently?

TJ: You play a good plan here. D3 forces white to add a stone (making it heavy) and J3 assists your attack.]
;W[ep];B[dn]C[TJ: Good attacking shape, but keep an eye out for a possible invasion at C5 should white get settled enough on the outside to support this.]
;W[hq];B[hp]C[I was pushing hard to threaten the possibility of capture while
building up a wall to get territory on the bottom right quadrant
of the board.];W[gq];B[ir];W[hr];B[gp]C[TJ: Vital points first - you need to defend the cutting point J4 in good time. You got into a really messy fight later because white was able to cut at J4.]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[dp]C[TJ: A classic bad move for white - this is "aji keshi" since white forces black to strengthen himself in the lower left. White gains absolutely nothing, while losing the chance later to play such moves as B2 and B3. Better simply to defend at E2.]
;B[cq];W[er];B[mq]C[Too low?  Perhaps a better placement would be M4?  ...or somewhere
else entirely?

TJ: I'd have defended J4 here. This move is too one-dimensional, anyway - it grabs a little territory, but that's about it. Besides, it looks like you've played too many stones at the bottom of the board (over-concentration).]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[en]LB[dm:A][em:B]
(;B[dm]C[Again, too slow?  I thought about this stone for a while before
playing it, but I couldn't think out the risks of not playing
this extension, so I took the cautious approach.  I made an alternative
move tree to try to plot out what I was thinking during the game
regarding a play at E7.  I was also considering playing elsewhere
on the board, but I chickened out and went with the extension.

TJ: Still, I think the vital point is J4. K5 might be a stylish way to defend it indirectly while enlarging the lower side.]
;W[qe];B[ed]C[I became afraid that white would play here.  Is this the correct
approach?

TJ: Certainly you need to break up white's framework, but even so, I'd probably do something about J4 here. After all, even after whie played at E16, black would still have possible invasions at R8, M17 and R13.]
;W[de]C[White's stone caught me off guard.  I fully expected white 34
to be at E17.  I have to admit, the exchange in this top-left
corner is where I first became certain I'd lost the match.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[fb];B[dd];W[ce];B[bb];W[dg];B[dh]C[TJ: You need to make sure of life by capturing with B16. If white now played E18, you'd be running for your life.]

(;W[eg];B[gd];W[eh];B[di];W[ad]
(;B[eb]C[I chickened out again.  I probably should have played elsewhere,
but I'm not certain where.  I _wanted_ to continue pressuring
white's ability to escape and/or make eyes.  No intention of
capturing, just pressuring while I build territory.

TJ: You could capture F18 by playing G18. This would be quite large and would give you total security with follow-up moves around L17 etc.]
;W[fc]C[TJ: You begin a pretty strong attack soon, but first you might have defended with E17 - the attack fails because at the critical moment you find you have to go back and defend. Remember, VITAL POINTS before big points. Defend you weaknesses and then you have both hands free for fighting. The same applies to J4, and, in a few moves' time, to the cutting point at L13. Vital points may not look large, but in fact they are gigantic because of the effect they have on developments in later fights - why take a big point if you only have to give back all the territory and more in order to make some weak group live which has fallen under attack because of neglecting a vital point?]
;B[fd];W[hb];B[cf];W[ee];B[be];W[bd];B[gf];W[gh];B[ig];W[fj]
;B[ei]C[No idea what I was thinking.  Perhaps this stone is better at
J11, pressuring white to F8 (or some-such), then allowing me
to try around L17?];W[fi];B[fg];W[gg];B[ff];W[fh];B[ii];W[hf]
C[TJ: This is my point exactly: because you have to go back and defend, your attack comes to nothing.]
;B[he];W[if]C[I felt that this stone hurt, however (in hindsight) my response
(next play) was useless.  I got the greedy idea that maybe I
_should_ try for the capture, not just the pressuring to build
territory.  It didn't quite go how I hoped.];B[hg];W[ie];B[id]
C[I first just hoped to put pressure on the top-center white stones,
and perform a divide-and-conquer strategy to grab one group or
the other.];W[jd];B[hd]
(;W[jf]C[TJ: This is a blunder. White could set up a "flower-viewing" or "picnic" ko....]
;B[jg];W[fe];B[kf];W[je];B[jc]C[I played here because I began to see that the top-left group
of mine might not have two eyes.  I became chicken that I had
to put pressure somewhere to either make a capture, or make eyes.
I opted to try to capture the top four white stones.  Bad choice.]
;W[kc]C[As soon as white placed this stone, I realized that I had comitted
a miscount error.  If I K18, then white L16, and I don't think
I could capture the white stones before they capture K17-18.

TJ: Black should descend to K18, anyway, since this gives you more liberties to play with (increases "aji" or "potential").]
;B[ec]C[Now my group is secure....];W[ge]C[.... but so is white's....]
;B[jb]C[...which somehow I fail to see, and I plan to try and capture
the top four anyway (I miscounted again, and gave myself a false
sense of security in the attack).];W[kb];B[kd];W[ef];B[ke];W[gf]

(;B[fa]C[TJ: This is far too small. L13 is a glaring cutting point which needs urgently to be defended. Indeed, defending J4 would also be a very good idea here. Besides, this is the wrong move to get profit - G18 is the tesuji. However, VITAL POINTS before big points. Very soon the game descends into desperate fighting, which you could have avoided by defending your vital points in good time.]
;W[gb]C[Oops.];B[ab]C[Too small.  I should have played elsewhere.

TJ: I could not agree more. Defend either L13 or J4!];W[ip]
C[TJ: Now all hell breaks loose.];B[jp];W[io];B[gn];W[jo];B[kp]
;W[ko];B[lp];W[fm]
(;B[hn]C[Perhaps this stone should have been H7?

TJ: H7 is a dubious shape since there is often a cut available at H6.]
;W[jm];B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[ik];B[jl];W[lm];B[nl]C[I placed this stone to threaten to capture (and hopefully do
so) while also allowing an attack at the bottom right.  The center
capture did not work... actually, it backfired and I ended up
handing white the entire top-center stones of mine.  My only
solace is that the opportunity to attack the bottom right _did_
pan out.

TJ: This fight is chaotic and I have no idea how it should all work out. What I do know is that you needed to defend both L13 and J4 in good time. Trying to fight while you have weaknesses like that to aim at is just like trying to box when standing on one leg - it's easy to get tripped up!]

(;W[ll]C[TJ: Too slow - M9 is correct shape.];B[kk];W[mk];B[nk]
;W[mj];B[nj];W[mi]C[Now I start to see that white will have an opportunity to attack
my top-center stones.  I played wrong (trying to hyper-aggressively
surround the white stones).  I should have tried to build two
eyes and/or connect to the bottom-center stones (which later
connect to the left side), right?];B[nh];W[ni];B[oi];W[kj]C[Ouch.  Now I'm afraid that I'll lose the stones.]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[gk];W[hj];B[gj];W[hi];B[kl];W[ki];B[kg];W[ji]
;B[km]C[Hoping to salvage something.  Should have focused on saving 7-stone
L-shape near top, right?];W[ln];B[kn];W[lo];B[fk];W[gl]C[Yikes!]
;B[fl];W[gm];B[fn];W[em];B[eo];W[do];B[fo]C[Well, I'll live, but I just had my left side decimated.]
;W[co];B[bo];W[bn];B[ap];W[cn];B[dl];W[bl];B[bk];W[an];B[ar]
;W[cl]
(;B[ql]C[Finally, I feel that I get to take sente again.  Should I have
attacked now, or played to save the 7-stone L-shape in the top-center?

TJ: I don't know if the 7-stone group could be saved, but one way to try might be to use the aji of K18 by playing at M17 and trying to squeeze out some space to make eyes. Even so, it looks very difficult to make it live and so I think you made the right decision here.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[qp];B[pr];W[rm];B[rl];W[qh];B[qm]C[Unnecessary stone, right?  Even without me placing this stone,
I'm not certain white could make life.  I chickened out though,
and placed it anyway.  However, in hindsight, whether white could
survive or not is unimportant compared to this last opportunity
to save my 7-stone L-shape, right?];W[mh]C[I _finally_ realized the 7-stone shape was going to die.  Ouch.]
;B[oh];W[mf];B[of];W[md];B[od];W[oc];B[qf]C[Not certain what I expected from this attachment.  Just grasping
at straws now, because I was certain I was losing by a lot.]
;W[rf];B[pe];W[re];B[ga];W[ib];B[si]C[Probably not the right time to place this stone, but I was still
quite certain I was losing by a pile of stones.];W[rh];B[ri]
C[Bad stone.  I knew it as soon as I'd placed it.  Too slow, right?]
;W[qi];B[rj];W[pk];B[oj];W[pl];B[pm];W[sh];B[qk];W[pj];B[mo]
;W[nd];B[hs]C[This stone begins another mis-read sequence.  I thought I might
have a chance to capture.  I'm getting desperate at this point.]
;W[gs];B[fq];W[is];B[js];W[fr];B[hs];W[fp]C[Duh.  Exactly what was I thinking?  ...if I only knew.  :P]

;B[ph];W[ol];B[nm];W[om];B[pn]C[Unnecessary, right?  If white plays here, then I can just T9
or S6 to make two eyes.];W[im];B[hm];W[lk];B[al];W[ak];B[aj]
;W[am];B[cm]C[Bad play, right?  Only one point, and there are _many_ better
plays.  I recall regretting this stone as soon as I placed it
because it is poor end-play.

TJ: RULE OF THUMB for ENDGAMES.

0) See if you can play elsewhere (if his threat does not affect a life and death situation, see if you can threaten mutual damage elsewhere before simply following him about the board).
1) Take territory in SENTE first.
2) Take big GOTE moves next (these can be surprisingly big - a hane and connect on second line can be worth about 14 points!).
3) Finally, REVERSE SENTE moves (that is, moves which defend against a sente incursion).]

;W[lg];B[hs];W[ci];B[ch];W[is];B[gi];W[hh]C[White took a _long_ time calculating the snap-back risk.  Thought
he was going to let it slide.  Hehehhehe.  Good thing he didn't;
I hate winning/losing games due to a single late-game MAJOR mistake.

TJ: I like your attitude. Indeed, it is better to know that you won here because you played better overall than your opponent.]
