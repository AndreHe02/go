AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Peti29> Hi

Thank you for reviewing this game!

I've deleted unrelated "goodbye" comments from during game.

My ingame comments are prefixed as "Peti29 [14k\]"

while my after game comments start like "Peti29>"

Sorry for my English...


Hi, my name is Yannick (6k on kgs) and I prefixed all my coments with '/Y']

(;B[qe]SQ[rd]C[Peti29> M17 suprised me. Now I think S16 is better.

/Y
M17 is quite a common approach in handicap games. 

R15 makes the W stone stronger (especially if W plays Q14 in response) while not protecting the corner territory. A good move for B in this situation is N15

A pincer is also appropriate (R10 for instance)];W[qn];B[mq]
;W[re];B[rd];W[pj]TR[qf][qn]C[Peti29> I myself also try to build this shape if I give many handi.]
;B[pf];W[rf];B[dj];W[nq];B[pq]C[/Y
Q3 is probably stressing too much the corner territory, wich is rather small considering a white slide at S4 or S3
N4 is a better alternative];W[rq];B[mp]C[/Y
good];W[np];B[no];W[oo]
(;B[op]C[/Y 
Why noy B Q5, which makes miai of P6 and P4];W[mo];B[nn];W[nr]
;B[mr];W[pr]
(;B[pn]C[/Y
B can capture the three W cutting stones with P2
Here B capture the P5 W stone but if W saves the 3 O2 stones, the B group N2 is separated from the other B stones]

C[Peti29> I tried to make use of the wall so I didn't respond directly to E3.

Is J3 at a good position?

Would K3 or H3 be better?

/Y
W can still save his 3 O2 stones with R2.
But considering B can also capture them if need be, I think H3 is better]
;W[co];B[ep];W[fp];B[cq];W[dr];B[fq]C[/Y
good];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[fo];W[hq];B[gp];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip]
;B[jq];W[ir]C[/Y
W is living with (close to) no territory while giving B an overwhelming influence on the left, this is good for B]
;B[jp]C[/Y
Here B must capture the 3 O2 W stones instead (at P2 or R2)]
;W[io];B[jo];W[jn]C[/Y
why not playing J6 instead of L6 ?]
(;B[kn];W[hn];B[im]C[/Y
This is a mistake
Better at N7 or even G5];W[go];B[in]C[Peti29> Here I wasn't aware of the atari at F4. However I still think that J6 was big enough to worth losing the G3 group.]

Have you considered C7 instead ?];W[cm];B[dl];W[dk]
(;B[ek]C[/Y
W could kill the W grop by playing like in the variation];W[ck]

(;B[ci];W[qc]TR[ci][dj][ek]C[Peti29> I think that this kind of diagonal shape is very strong when not touched. Here it is touched but I still think it's strong.

/Y
I think C11 is better at C10 (and W can live by ko, see var)]

;W[df];B[bg];W[cn];B[en];W[gm];B[bn];W[ee];B[gf];W[bh]C[/Y
Here W is threatening to connect his C9 dead group];B[fe]C[/Y
Is F15 really important ?
I dont think it achieves a lot];W[bj];B[bm];W[bl];B[al]C[Peti29> It was only a timeout move.]
;W[bk];B[cr]C[/Y
C2 is gote and not so big, while there are big moves left, such as capturing the 2 lone M18 W stones]
;W[cs];B[br]C[/Y
Why not B1 if you want to respond here (which I would not recommend) ?]
;W[bi];B[fj];W[ch]
(;B[gh]C[Peti29> I feared that all F10 group will die if I fill in at E10.

/Y
E10 is very small, agreed (3 points). THere are still big moves to play: capturing the M18 stones, reducing/invading the right side, R2, ...

I think the F10 is in no great danger (B can jump to H9)];W[gi]
;B[hi];W[gj];B[gk];W[ej];B[dj]C[/Y
what good is it to capture 1 stone that has no impact on the game ?]

;W[id];B[ld];W[ni]C[Peti29> O11 was very big I think, and I did not really know what to react.

/Y
B can play K17 or erode at R8];B[lh]C[Peti29> So M12 was a move to strengthen all directions, but it doesn't defend any particular moyo.

/Y
It does not strengthen anything since all B groups are alive at this point, and you're right it doesn't defend any particular moyo (nor territory). Therefore B played on a neutral point with a no value.]

W saves his M18 stones];B[kd];W[jf];B[ig]C[/Y
Try to think of what you want to achieve, when playing, do not respond automatically to W.]

;W[hc];B[kb]C[/Y
Why play here ? I think the 2 stones cannot be saved];W[ij]
;B[ji];W[ii];B[ih];W[pk]C[Peti29> I "disliked" this move cause it ruined my plans on R8...]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[qr];W[qq];B[or];W[ls]C[Peti29> I just hate monkey jump. It's always a thrill to respond to it.]
;B[jr];W[js];B[kr];W[ks];B[ms];W[lr];B[lq];W[is];B[ns]TR[mp]
[lq][mq]C[Peti29> I treat this "empty triangle"-like shape dangerous so I was to defend it beforehand.

/Y
It is bad shape because it loses a liberty which can impact subsequent fighting. Here it really does not matter because all B groups are alive anyway.]
;W[rr];B[qs];W[rb];B[qa];W[ra];B[pb];W[am];B[ap];W[ef];B[oh]
C[Peti29> This very move is my favourite during the whole game : )

/Y
You can also capture the W H9 group by playing at H7, which is worth around 20 points.]

Either is ok. But you should read the life-and-death problem before playing :)]
