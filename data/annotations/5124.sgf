C[Hi, iI'm creeed on kgs, i played white in this game. the game was close (4.5 pts loss). An my mistake was - i think - my invasion/reduction on the right side.

If you have any information on how to improve my direction of play, and how to take advantage of my opponent's mistakes, i would be grateful.
I added some comments, feel free to comment my comments^^
Thanks a lot  for your time and patience.

R: Hi, I'm "unstable" from KGS. Hope you find this review useful.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[fd];B[di];W[ic]C[R: This seems alittle small at this stage, because D17 group is already stable. How about an approach at P16 or Q5 instead?]
;B[oc]LB[qj:A]C[i believe it was black's first mistake to tenuki from the top left, but was my invasion right, should have i waited?

R: Usually after this corner enclosure, a move around A becomes very big for both sides. The black's group on the left is light; and black can't efficiently settle it with one move. So P17 is ok for black. On the other hand, white can't attack is efficiently either, so A is better for white.]

;W[ce];B[bf];W[ee];B[fg]LB[dd:A][be:C][ef:B]C[R: Instead of B as in the game, consider "A". Then "C" is no longer sente for black. This can make a big difference in terms of stability of the black's group later on.]
;W[ef];B[fi];W[ej];B[ei];W[cl]C[i thought about playing B15 before, but this seemed like a good attack on the black group

R: actually since B15 is sente for black, this group is pretty strong. C8 seems alittle too close; black will pincer it at c6 (as in the game)

I prefer C7 (to enclose the corner while reducing black's influence). B15 is also very big. 

Note that by attacking this group, white has created an extra big point at C6. This means that black will get one of R10 or C6. Before the attack, if white takes R10 right away, black C6 is not nearly as big. This shows that the attack is premature.]
;B[cn]C[R: Good move for black. C8 was too far.];W[cj];B[ci]
;W[dn]C[i was hoping to build a wall facing the str on th lower right]
;B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[ep];B[dm];W[en];B[cm];W[em];B[cp]C[R: Seems D8 is bigger for black.... but not sure...]
;W[dl];B[dq];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[fk];W[el]LB[mp:A]C[and it went quite well, but is the exchange fair? Did black get too much territory? 

Note that white got a wall but black also got a big corner. Moreover the corner was white to begin with. Moreover, black got sente! So the white wall is missing its extension. If black goes around "A" next move, then black is better.

I didn't give it much thought, but is the corner killable?

R: I very much doubt it. The shape is too big.];B[pj]LB[mp:A]
C[R: Wrong direction. This is big but around A is more urgent!]
;W[lq]C[i was glad to be able to play this one

R: Very good.];B[lo];W[jp]C[R: This is too close to thickness. On the other hand, it's not clear how to attack M5. In this case, consider tenuki such as P15 or S16 or Q5.]
;B[jn]
(;W[ho]C[is it the best way to use the wall?black gets  a lot of influence facing his shimari, i was not feeling so well then

It seems tha black is ahead, isn't he?

R: Just at a glance, black has 3  big corners and B15 is still open.  White only has upper left and bottom. So seems black is ahead quite abit. I count about 70 for black and about 45+6.5 comi for white. Moreover black has more potential than white.]
;W[rd]C[i like this move, eventhough i screw up everytime i play it

Anyway thanks again for your time and patience.

R: Thanks for showing your game. It's an interesting one.

After black captured O6, black was winning too much (20 points lead for black). So by that time, white had already a hard time. There were mistakes before that which made the game difficult for white. One thing to remember is to try using thickness for attacking. When you are strong, dont get yourself be humiliated by replies such as H5. Instead, cut and coutner-attack. Also, remember to cut in response to S15 instead of S17.]
