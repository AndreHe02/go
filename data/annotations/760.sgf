AB[jj][pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Comments on this game are intended to be from the perspective of the black player, who asked for the review via the GTL.]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[jq];B[fq];W[pr];B[rq]C[r3 is more usual here.]
;W[qg];B[qj]C[Good. A pincer which is also an extension from your lower right corner.]
;W[rd];B[of]C[r17 puts more pressure on the group];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[Too close. K17 is better if you want to play from this side. This is likely to end up too close to your wall. r18/q18 is better here.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[nb];B[oa];W[me];B[ld];W[md];B[le]
;W[mf];B[oh];W[oe];B[pe];W[pf];B[pg];W[qf];B[ne];W[nd];B[od]
;W[nf];B[oe];W[lf]C[White now has a very heavy group with no eyes which you should aim to attack while making a profit on both sides. Moves around j16 and n11 are close nough to attack while building strength and territory for yourself.]
;B[mh];W[jf];B[ic]C[j16 better];W[fc]C[Think what you want to achieve here.]
;B[fe];W[db];B[he]C[This connects well & puts the corner and the centre group under pressure, you should be able to kill one or the other.]
;W[jd];B[jc];W[id];B[hd];W[ie]C[This is a desperate attempt to make eyes. Where is the vital point?]
;B[hf]C[Not here...];W[ke]C[At this point, one eye is certain. A play at l15 one move earlier would have put White in deep trouble. Where is the vital point now?]
;B[kc]C[This is unnecessary to defend the group, and fails to attack either white group. c17 or l13 are much better,l16 at least forces j14.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[cf];B[df];W[ch];B[eh]C[This builds no territory & does not attack. C9 much better.]
;W[ck];B[cm];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[br];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[er];W[aq];B[iq];W[ir];B[ip];W[jp];B[hr];W[jr];B[io]
;W[jo];B[in]C[The hane at k6 is safe and good.];W[el];B[em]
;W[dl];B[dm];W[ao];B[bn];W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[jh]C[Good move. Makes the potential eye at m13 false.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[lj];B[kl];W[ll];B[km];W[mk];B[nj];W[nk];B[oj]
;W[qe];B[qh]C[Nice shape, defends the group well.];W[lm];B[jg]
C[The hane at m6 is essential to prevent a link to the group below. This fails to stop the eye being formed.]
;W[kg];B[if];W[kd];B[kj];W[li];B[gc];W[ec];B[ed];W[bd];B[be]
;W[bc];B[ce];W[bf]C[Now the hane at f8 is big, or the shape play at e10.]
;B[dg];W[fj];B[gj]C[This forces white to strengthen his position.]
;W[fi];B[fh]C[g11/12 defends better.];W[gi];B[hj];W[fm];B[gm]
C[There is more potential below. g6 is better.];W[fn];B[gn]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[gp];B[go];W[fp];B[gq];W[gl];B[hl];W[gh];B[gg]

;W[qp];B[qq];W[rp];B[sp];W[so];B[qo];W[sq];B[ro];W[sp];B[sn]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr]C[Well played! :-)];W[rh];B[ri];W[sh]
;B[si];W[rg];B[fb];W[mi];B[nh]C[Good.];W[eb];B[gb];W[hh];B[hg]
;W[eo];B[do];W[hp];B[hq]C[Look for bigger moves!];W[la];B[lb]
;W[ma];B[ka];W[ae];B[fd];W[ii];B[ij];W[jn];B[jm];W[lq]C[This point was a start for an attack that could have killed the whole lower side. It was far bigger than any of the last 10 moves.]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[ho];W[fl];B[en];W[kk];B[jk];W[lk];B[ss];W[qs]
C[Pay here before the corner.];B[cs];W[bs];B[ds];W[ng];B[og]
;W[ni];B[oi];W[oo];B[po]C[Try to stop replying automatically. This was not needed, and you could have played a big point elsewhere.]
