C[I have put in a couple variations where I saw we could have played better.
  I am especially interested in places where direction of play was incorrect.
   DrGoPlayer

[EV\] This is your reviewer Eric Vella.  My comments will be marked this way.  This was a good game for both sides, with some very nice moves.  There were a few mistakes in direction of play, plus a few tactical problems, which I tried to point out.

One basic lesson for both sides is to avoid forcing your opponent to split your positions.  An extreme example of what I am talking about is shown in the variation below.]

(;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[iq];W[qf]
;B[qi];W[qc]C[I looked this up later in Kogo's and put in the joseki.  drgoplayer]

(;B[qb]
(;W[rc]C[[EV\] This move looks awkward, giving W a cramped shape  See variations for some better alternatives for W.]

(;B[pd];W[rb];B[pb];W[qe];B[jc]C[Too far?  drgoplayer

[EV\] Yes, B should just make a normal three space extension.  This wide extension leaves behind a dangerous invasion point.  If B later defends against the invasion, his shape becomes a bit over-concentrated, defeating the purpose of the original wide extension.  

A wide extension like this is possible when it serves as both an extension and a pincer (for example if the D16 stone was black and W had a stone at F17). 

A wide extension is also reasonable when B has forcing moves around P14 to extend the wall, protecting against a W invasion and making a big territory.  That is not the case here.

Finally, note that the W upper rigtht corner lacks eye space if B plays S13.  This would force W to run out.  In preparation for this, B would like to have a strong group on top.]

(;W[df]C[[EV\] In view of the previous comments, I think W should extend the other way, to take advantage of the thin B top position.  See variations.  This corner enclosure aims toward the top, but B gets to move there first.]
;B[fc]C[[EV\] Good.];W[nq]C[[EV\] This invasion is not urgent.  W should not mind if B gets some territory here, as the low B shape to the left does not threaten to make a big moyo.  If W wants to play around here first, how about simply taking the corner at R3?  B has to decide which side to block, and W will probably get sente.  But actually I think the top is still the vital area.]

(;B[lq]C[[EV\] I would prefer to play Q3 or P3 or even O4 (see variation) instead of this pincer, planning to take the corner, letting W make a cramped position on the bottom.  The point is that the right side is more open, with more potential for development, than the bottom, which is already played out.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[Right direction?  Over concentrated the other way?  drgoplayer]
;W[rp]C[[EV\] W should connect with Q3 first.  This hane and connection will still be sente later.  What happens if B switches to Q3 now?]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]C[[EV\] B misses another chance to block at Q3.  Note that W could not cut, as the ladder is good for B.]
;W[pq];B[np]C[[EV\] P4 is the correct shape in this position.  W should break into the center with N4 now.]
;W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[mp];W[db]C[[EV\] Good.];B[hd];W[cj]C[[EV\] This move is a bit thin.  It seems unlikely W can make territory on both sides, certainly not more than second-line territory.  I think a move one space higher (C11), cleanly defending the more important side,  is actually stronger.  If B then invades below, W will be strong on both sides, so only B will come under attack, and W will naturally get to erase the B center thickness.]
;B[ch]C[[EV\] Perfect invasion point.  Note that this invasion is only good because the H16 group is very stable, so W has no opportunity for a leaning attack.

I think B could also simply play forcing reduction moves like E10, giving W a small side in exchange for more center thickness.]
;W[dh];B[ci];W[cg];B[di];W[dj]C[[EV\] The last two W moves were terrible, forcing B to break right through the W side and leaving bad shape.  Look at it this way -- once B breaks through and makes a strong group, the W stones contacting this group become weak and inefficient.  W should see this coming and avoid contact plays here, once he decides to let B out.]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk]C[[EV\] Great move.];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[fl];B[gk];W[el];B[gi]C[[EV\] B should be very happy with this result.]
;W[fo];B[go];W[hm]
(;B[fn]LB[nj:B][in:A]C[Is black better at A?  drgoplayer

[EV\] Yes, A is probably better.  Or you could play a more patient large move like B.]
;W[gm]C[[EV\] Why not G8 instead?  Sente against the group above.]
;B[in];W[fp];B[gp]
(;W[pj]C[I thought the alternative might be better for white.  drgoplayer

[EV\] This move looks dangerous but necessary.  Simple safe continuations leave B ahead on territory.]
;B[pi]
(;W[nj];B[oi];W[oj]LB[lk:A][ml:B]C[[EV\] W should play lightly within the B sphere of influence., for example at A or B.  W would be happy to get outside forcing moves and good shape if B cut and captured the Q10 stone.]
;B[of]C[This was my intent in pushing.  drgoplayer

[EV\] Good plan.  Did you read that S13 would kill W, once B is sufficiently thick on the outside? 

A higher level strategy is to continue the attack with a move around M10 which blocks the W group from connecting through the center.  When W moves out with O11 or N11, B gets natural momentum for moves around P13 or P14, for a nice splitting attack.  Force your opponent to force you to play where you want to play anyway :)]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[li];B[lg];W[hj];B[gj];W[ff];B[ih]
C[Keep some pressure on right side group.  drgoplayer

[EV\] Another very nice move.];W[im];B[jm];W[jl];B[km];W[nm]
;B[on];W[hf];B[if]C[[EV\] Here B is doing the same sort of thing W did with C13 and D10 -- pretending to block, but actually forcing his opponent to break through his position.  This block only succeeds in keeping W out if B continues with the ko sequence shown as a variation, which B is not really going to risk here.  It is better therefore to simply defend the center group without forcing W to squeeze through, say with K13 or perhaps K10.]
;W[ie]
(;B[jf];W[he];B[id];W[je];B[ke]C[[EV\] More of the same, contact plays which do not stop a break-through and hence leave weaknesses.  W chickened out here, but he should really break through and punish B for his overplays.]

;W[nl];B[nn];W[mr];B[lr];W[ls];B[ks];W[ms];B[mq]C[[EV\] What if W cuts now?]
;W[nr];B[jr];W[dq];B[er];W[bj];B[bg];W[bf];B[bi];W[rh]C[[EV\] Finally!  Could W have lived if B played S13 first?]
;B[qh]C[[EV\] Aji-keshi and bad shape (empty triangle).  The simple connection at S11 is better shape and leaves S13 as a threat.  Or just tenuki, since the W cut is not dangerous.]
;W[rg];B[ha];W[eb];B[ri]C[[EV\] Is this worth more than 1 point?  Now the R12-S13 exchange is clearly very bad.  B lost a full move here.

B has earned large sente moves at A14 and A10, yet he never gets them :(]
;W[ag];B[bh]C[[EV\] Connenting here is fairly small and unsatisfying.  B should be unhappy at letting W get this move in sente, since A14 was really sente for B.  Also, B gives up the option of starting a ko at A12, which looks more dangerous for W than for B.]

;W[cs];B[ep];W[eo];B[do]C[I dont see how this can work.  drgoplayer

[EV\] B loses quite a few points here, compared to just playing A10 sente.  (Note that W cannot just block at A9 or B plays A12 with a double threat.)

C[Black seems overconcentrated here.  Is that correct?  drgoplayer

[EV\] No, this joseki is fine for both.  W absolutely needs one more move here to finish the joseki (S18, worth over 20 points).  B can then take sente to play elsewhere, or he can continue with A (to break up the top) or B (to expand the right).]
