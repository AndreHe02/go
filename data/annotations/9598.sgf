 kingt403 BC : Hi!



-- Hello Gurego, I'm Sven and about 7 kyu at DGS. I'll try to clear things a bit up for you.
All my comments are preceeded by "--" so you can spot them more easily.

-- In the end, White manage to take home a clear victory, so there is not so much room for improvement. However, both players played rather defensive and territory-oriented; this is ok for the later stages of the game, but in the beginning it meant a disadvantage for White. Here you should have taken the center into account and played more influence-oriented, relying on (usually) White's better fighting abilities. It was not until move 20 or so that game started to favor White, this because Black did not take advantage of White's letting free space on the board and played too defensive himself, thus letting you confine him to the right third of the board. Afterward, there were only minor flaws, as you will see in my comments.]
