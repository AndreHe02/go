TM[1800]RE[W+7.5]US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[0.5];B[pc];W[qe];B[pg]C[Play another corner  point.  White is just bullying you.]
;W[qg];B[qd]C[This is small compared with the  open corners.  It also invites white to separate you.]
;W[ph];B[pf]L[og]C[If you  must play here, `a' is better.  But play in another corner instead.]
;W[qf];B[pe];W[md];B[kd]C[I don't think you're strong enough  in this corner for this pincer to be effective.

A move in any other corner is much bigger.];W[od];B[pd];W[mf];B[ng];W[kc]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[id];W[ld];B[mb]L[dd][ed][ec][dc]M[id][jc]C[Is this too early here ?
Should I have played better on a,b,c

Is your plan to kill the white stones?  I don't think you can at this point.   I like
a move in any corner, particularly `c' and even `d,' as they work well with  the marked
stones.  However, you are undercut at l18, so your top area is not terribly  secure.]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[ke];B[jd]M[kd]C[This move is extremely  small.  Abandon the marked stone, and be happy if white wastes
a move taking it.  There are still points on the board which are at least 20  times as  good.]
;W[mg];B[oh];W[pi];B[ne]M[od]C[Attack the group and cut off  marked stone (too early ?)

Much too early.  If you cut off the white stone, you will get two points.  If  you attack
the white group, you will just make it stronger.  Play in another corner.]
;W[nf];B[nd];W[nh];B[og];W[lh];B[dc]L[oi]C[Try to make territory;   I know I keep saying to play in another corner, but now I think things have  developed  far enough that you need to keep white separated on the right.  Play at `a.']
;W[nc];B[oc];W[me];B[oe]M[nd][ne]C[Small.  This move is worth six  points.  Let white capture the marked stones if he
wants to.  Play a 20 point move elsewhere.];W[jh];B[hf]L[if][ce][de]
C[more aggressive play on a better ?

No...you have no hope of killing this white group.  Play a shimari at `b' or  `c' instead,
or play in one of the other corners.];W[if];B[ie]M[ie][id][jd]L[he]
C[Bad shape (empty triangle).  Play at `a' instead.  As it is, you now have  a cutting
point at `a' to worry about.

Even better...play in another corner.];W[jf];B[hh]L[hg]C[This will leave you  vulnerable.  Play at `a' instead, or, better yet... :-)]
;W[de];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[df];B[cf]L[dh]C[This white group is killable.  Just connect at `a.']
;W[eg];B[dh];W[ff];B[ed]L[fe][eh]C[Destroy eye shape

Point `a' (the eye-stealing tesuji) is better for this---if you can afford  it.

I'd be more concerned with sealing white in at `b.'  If white gets out, it  doesn't
matter that you've destroyed his eye shape.];W[ce];B[bg];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc]
;B[be];W[bb];B[db];W[dd];B[bd];W[cd];B[ba]L[eh][fd]C[Not necessary.  White  cannot get an eye in the corner.  Better to play `a,' to keep
him from getting out, or `b' to strengthen yourself.  You are getting _very_  weak here.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[fe];B[fc];W[ef];B[ec]M[ed][ee]C[No!  Let white have  these stones.  He cannot get an eye here.]
;W[eh];B[gc]L[hb]C[To prevent invasion at a and cut off of the group

I think you're worry is justified.  Unfortunately, white is now out.];W
[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[gg];W[gf];B[ge];W[gj];B[fh]L[hi]C[Play `a' instead.]
;W[hi];B[gh];W[ej]L[ii][hj][ih]C[Now he had closed in my group. How could I have prevent this ?

It's not really closed in.  Consider black `a,' white `b,' black `c.'];B
[di];W[ig];B[hg];W[ei];B[jb]L[ha]C[Good.  The monkey  jump (white `a') could have been fatal.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dl];B[cn]C[Try to  take influence on the corner

You are too far.  The way to influence the corner is to play _in_ the corner.]
;W[dn];B[do];W[en];B[eo];W[gn];B[cp]L[cq]C[sealing the corner

I think it's still quite open.  Point `a' might be better, but you are still  quite high.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[iq];B[io]L[fq][hp][ho]C[Also taken a into consider, but my group would have been enclosed.
Would b have worked ?

Your wall is too high.  I don't think white will have any problem living  underneath,
but you don't want him connecting through.  Your jump is a bit premature,  though.
If white wedges in, he can enclose your corner group anyway.  Try just  pushing out to `c.'

Regardless, I think a move in the remaining corner is bigger.];W[eq];B[dq]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[er];B[fp]L[pp]C[This is at most a one-point move.  Think  big!  Play `a.']
;W[fq];B[hp]C[Again, this is not a big move.];W[hq];B[gq]C[This is very small.  You cannot hope to kill white.]
;W[gr];B[gp]L[jq][pq]C[I think a would have been better

I think `a' would be a mistake.  Something like `b' would have been _much_  better.]
;W[jp];B[ko]L[jo]M[io][ko]C[This one-space jump is cuttable with a white wedge  at `a.']
;W[kq];B[oq]L[pp][qq]C[I think this is the  wrong corner point.  It emphasizes the bottom side, where you have
very little potential.  Since white has stones relatively close on both  sides, I think
you should take a symmetrical position with `a' or `b.'  When white  approaches on one
side, extend on the other.];W[qp]C[White takes advantage of the mistake in  direction.  This is a _good_ move.]
;B[oo]C[This move invites white to take a  healthy territory on the right side.]
;W[pn]C[This is a _very good_ move.];B[pl]C[Ambitious.];W[qk];B[oj];W[ql]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[on];W[po];B[pp]L[lk]C[Very small.  You should be looking to take some center territory now.  I'm  not sure of
the best point, but `a' is appealing.];W[pq];B[op];W[qq];B[pj]L[or]C
[This is very small.  You still have an opportunity to get some territory in  the
center.  Or, if you want to cause white some damage, how about `a'?];W[qj]
;B[ni]L[mi][jl][ii]C[Think I should have expanded further to a or b

Or get out with `c.'];W[mi];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk];W[lk];B[kp]L[lq][lp]
[jl]C[Big mistake ?!
Better a or b?

This depends on what you are trying to do.  You simply cannot kill that white  group at the
bottom.  Now, I think you should aim at a point in the middle to reduce  white's potential
territory there.  Perhaps `c.'];W[mq];B[mp]L[mo][or]C[Avoid contact moves like this.  For  defense, play `a,' and for attack, play `b.']
;W[or];B[nr];W[nq];B[lq];W[lr];B[lp];W[mr];B[cl];W[lm]C[This is a big point.]
;B[mm]L[jm][nl]C[White's last move was very damaging.  Your best reply is to cause equal  damage, rather
than trying to secure a small territory.  Maybe `a'?  If you are worried  about getting
eyes, play `b.'];W[im]C[White does not deserve such a big center.];B[km]
L[kl]C[Trying to reduce his big moyo

Better to peep at `a,' to get further in.];W[kl];B[ln];W[ll];B[ml];W[jm]
;B[hn];W[hm];B[ii];W[hj];B[ih];W[jj];B[ij];W[ik];B[ji];W[ki];B[lb];W[lc]
;B[re]L[rd][ka]C[Just descend to `a' so that you can make a monkey jump if white  tenukis.

It's also quite valuable to connect underneath at `b,' so you don't have to  defend
on both sides.];W[ck];B[bk];W[dk];B[bm]L[dm][bl][cm][bj]C[should be a

No, `a' does not work.  Consider white `b,' black `c', white `d,' for a  double atari.]
