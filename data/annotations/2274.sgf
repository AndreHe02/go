C[Thank you for reviewing my game.  Any comments about my play would be very helpful.  If you could point out the big points on the board at certain points during the game that would be great.  Sometimes I can't decide where need to be playing.

Rev:  Hi, I am David Richfield (7k* IGS) If only I knew myself where the big moves were!  However, I will give my opinion.]

;B[hq];W[gp];B[gq];W[fp]C[Should I have played somewhere else here?

Rev:  I must admit, I've never played this type of opening sequence myself.  I am sure a dan player would have more comments here, but I think it would be unwise to simply ignore the situation as it stands here.]

SQ[cf][ch][fg][hj][ck][gl]C[Rev: Although this is not a bad move in itself, I wonder whether it might not have been wiser to keep up the pressure on the stones black has been playing on your half of the board.  I marked some places where I might have considered playing, but I myself am unsure of the best moves here.  Maybe the move marked with a triangle would be a good prelude to an attack on black's single stone?

Another comment:  The sequence you started here ends up looking somewhat strange.  I can't put my finger on any disastrous moves though, so maybe you should ask for a review of this review, or ask a dan-level player how you should have approached black's side here.  at least you end in sente, and return to black's invasion, so it's not so bad.]

;B[el];W[fm]SQ[gl]TR[ck]MA[dg]C[Maybe I should have played somewhere bigger?

Rev: I also don't think that this was such a good move.  Peeping at a bamboo joint is ineffective.  Maybe you should seal black in more completely (square) or keep him away from his other stone (triangle).  The move marked with the triangle has the advantage that it attacks the four black invading stones, thereby strengthening the wall which is surrounding the lone black invader (X).]

Rev:  Definitely!];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[lp]LB[pm:A][rf:B]SQ[oi]
[oh][ph][qg][qi][mk][ok][qk]C[Rev: Maybe A instead?  Another possibility is to play B, cutting off black's  group (squares) so that you can strengthen your stones (triangles) by attacking them.]
;B[lq];W[mn];B[on];W[mp];B[mq];W[kk]LB[mj:A][li:A]C[Rev: Rather try to keep black's center stone apart from the other group, maybe by playing "A"or "B".]
;B[mi];W[le];B[ki];W[md]C[Rev: This is an inefficient move.  You do not need to make eyespace for your group, as you can easily connect it to the outside.]

Something like "C" or "D" might help to settle your stones (triangles) in sente.]

(;W[gj]LB[fk:A]C[Rev: Rather cut black off at "A"?  I tried one variation, but couldn't see a way for black to survive.]
;B[jh];W[jg];B[ih];W[ig];B[hk]C[Rev: Now black is connected.]

;W[mm];B[ap]C[Rev: Now black proceeds to make about 20 points profit by playing a series of small sente moves.  It's a bummer if your opponent gets these in, as they're rather hard to ignore.  You could try and watch for one which is not really huge sente, and play one of your own, but in this game you don't really have much. that I can see.]

game is over now.  I probably could have ignored some of blacks plays, and black also missed plays at L10 and N10

Rev:  I agree.  I don't know what black was doing in your territory, after all , he had won!!

Hope my comments helped.
