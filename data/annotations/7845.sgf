C[Dear reviewer.

My name is Ole. In this game I played white. The game has been played on KGS with 1 hour time + 20 stones in 5 minutes.

I added some comments and ideas to the SGF already.

The opening is quite unique, I would say. That means probably bad. I would like some suggestions there.
 The middle game was quite complicated. I missed some important moves and as well did my opponent. Maybe you could point out the most horrible mistakes. Also I built up some strength and did not know how to use it.
 In the endgame my opponent did not read properly and gave away the game. So the opening and the middlegame seem more interesting to review.

Thanks a lot in advance.

WOG:  Thanks for sending in the game.

This is a classic game of aggressive (wellgo) vs. passive (Zordon).  Wellgo attempts numerous overplays, while Zordon sacrifices too much.  Oddly, the game is balanced for the most part as you're both truly 1d, so the mistakes level out.

For you to improve, you need to sacrifice less.   Learn to save your stones.  You have already learned how to sacrifice and win; how to tenuki and find the win elsewhere.  Your particular path for improvement is to fight to live; fight to kill; fight.  My advice to wellgo is the opposite.

Another common theme missed in this game is miai.  Creating miai is a good thing.  Go is a game of options.  Creating miai gives you options.   There are times where you forego creating miai and select a path.  While every game is unique and sometimes it's better to not create miai, more times than not, you're better off giving yourself options.

What seems most lacking in the opening, however, is an appreciation for aji.  You tend to kill aji like a kyu player :)  Aji is a dish best served unplayed.  You tend to play wherever there's aji, whenever there's aji.]
;B[dd];W[pc];B[qo]C[Already hints of aggression :)];W[dp];B[fq]
(;W[hq]C[The right choice?

WOG: That's more a 9-dan problem to solve.  In my weak strength, my understanding is that one uses a pincer when White has a stone in the lower right corner, unlike the current circumstance; therefore, this play is less than optimal and not something I would do.  See variations.]
;B[fo]C[WOG: This seems right.  Now Black can counter pince the White stone at H3 and has a good relationship with the lower right corner stone; hence, why I find your move at h3 suboptimal.]
(;W[cn]C[WOG: Why not one space jump to D6?

This smacks of passivity];B[dr]C[WOG: IMHO, k3 is better for Black]
(;W[cq]C[WOG: One option...];B[dl]C[I felt this move was hard to answer. I decided to disturb the connection between blacks groups but was afraid to give black to strong a wall on the right.

WOG: This is a brutish tactic by Black.  Already, Black is leaving a hole between his stones around e7-f6 and has not counter pincered the White stone at say k3.  Black is playing brutish.  Black must be smelling the blood of your passivity?

Never be afraid to give your opponent something.  This attitude of "was afraid to give black too strong a wall on the right" is not balanced Go.  Balanced Go is Black gets something, White gets something.  The r5 stone is not in a good position to make use of a wall anyway.]
(;W[en]C[WOG: This seems like a fine idea to split, but is just one of many variations.  The other thing about this is that even if White is covered by Black, White still is fine in the corner by responding at c2, so possible to leave here and play on the side instead.  See variation.

The way you split as well is too connected.  White is safe underneath here without connecting to the outside.  Therefore, you don't need to connect your stones.  Try g7 e7 f6 ... moves like that when you're strong inside.]
(;B[ho]C[WOG:  Now with White having split, the usual concept of repincering with k3 is harder for Black to pull off, although still not impossible.]
;W[kq];B[eo]C[WOG: Black plays to thwart the double peep at g4]
(;W[em]C[WOG: This is certainly not following Black which shows good spirit.  Good for you!]
;B[gl]C[WOG: More brutish play by Black... Is the idea for Black to surround and kill the White stones??  Not sure what's Black's thinking here.  Black leaves a lot of holes in Black's shape.]
(;W[gm]C[WOG: Yes, there's a hole.  Do you need to play in the hole as soon as you see it?  No.  Aji is a weapon.  Untaken care of aji is a bigger weapon.  Playing inside and settling aji is one way to think, but usually not the right way to go.

Same comment as e6, why not split without connecting?];B[hm]
;W[gn];B[hp]C[WOG: the bait...]
(;W[gq]C[WOG: Oops!  You ate the bait!  

What's the good next for this move?  Black's already connected.  This is IMHO the wrong move.]
;B[el]C[WOG: Black is tenuously trying to trap White.  Now White is falling into a hard situation where reading needs to occur.  A proper Black move would be to make the wall at h6, but no... Black goes for the whole enchilada.]
;W[hn]C[WOG: This way is precarious... you need to be careful]
;B[in]C[WOG: Yikes!]
(;W[io]C[WOG: Oops.  This move doesn't help your liberties with the bamboo connected stones.  When your bamboo joint connection is prone to getting bamboozled, you need to play more directly.]
;B[do]C[WOG: Yep...];W[co];B[dn]C[WOG: Ouch!];W[im]C[WOG: Not being able to stop Black from connecting the stones is a tragedy]
;B[dm]C[WOG: Black connects!  How sad]

(;W[ck]C[I decided to give away the corner. Living inside gives black too much influence. Was this correct?

WOG: Nooooo...!!  Better to live small in the corner.  This is a terrible loss.]
;B[bm];W[bj];B[cm];W[fr]C[WOG: There's still aji in the corner!  Don't force Black to take this... Black is not going to play here in gote at the moment.  There's no sente on the bottom middle White group.]

WOG:  Yes,  I like playing for the side for White earlier when Black jumps to D2.  Always look for miai.  Playing White at l3 earlier raises the miai of Black jumping in the corner with c3 or attacking from outside at c8.  Either way, you can deal with it.

The issue, as I mentioned earlier, is that you're connecting your cutting stones to the live stones in the corner by playing at e6.  Therefore, your stones are overconcentrated here in this variation.  That said, you can't blame this variation on the moves at e7 and e8; they are not to blame.  The blame lies with e6.  That all said, q3 r3 q4 are all potential ways into Black's area.  Maybe p3 is best at this point, but that's another game.]

WOG: There are tons of joseki dictionaries online, but none raise the same circumstance of a stone at k4 and f3.  Go is too varied to be nailed down like that.  While knowing some joseki is good, knowing that you're playing in the place that's an ideal place for Black's stone is sufficient.  The rule is "Play the stone where your opponent would want to play it."  This is where I would want my stone if I were Black.]
