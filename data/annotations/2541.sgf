AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Matteo> Hi, I'm black. I appreciate some comments about my game.
I think the best way to improve is with comments form stronger player.
Please, comment also my stile of play and in with direction I would have to work to improve.

Thanks];W[dd];B[jp];W[qf];B[nc];W[qi]C[patrickb:
Okay, first point: while it is normal to take a two-point extension
from one stone, situations like this are exceptions. White normally
makes a three-point extension to R10 in situations or slides into the
corner at S15 before playing R11. The reason why is that now b can make
the R15/Q14 exchange and then w is a little overconcentrated.]
;B[jd];W[fq];B[eq]C[patrickb: Good.];W[fp];B[dn];W[iq];B[jq]
;W[nq];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp]C[Matteo> little :(

patrickb: yes, this is too small right now. How about something like P2 instead?]
;W[no];B[qn];W[ql]
(;B[pq]C[patrickb: you're getting sealed in, and now the K3 stones aren't working so well.]
;W[fn];B[dj];W[co]C[Matteo> Is this so severe or is a bluff?

patrickb: Just connecting here is reasonable. w will then play something like C3. See the variation.]

Not a bad recovery, all told. You're now really thick and need to find
a way to use it, though. Making territory with it directly is
unappealing. Again, how about coming out near P7? Capping at O7 is also
a possibility...];W[ch];B[fc];W[db];B[fe];W[ef];B[ee]C[patrickb:
crude. Before there was some aji near C14 and D13. You're making white
fix that. Are you getting enough compensation in return?];W[de]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[of];W[rd];B[qc];W[jf]C[patrickb:
ouch. This is why you weren't getting enough compenstation. Also, w can
still slide to F19.];B[qg];W[pg];B[pf];W[rg];B[qe];W[rf];B[re]
;W[se];B[og];W[ph];B[jh]C[patrickb:
Nice attempt at an attack here, to lean on the right side to get some
thickness first. Again, perhaps come out at P7 before this, though.
That way you can get him with multiple weak groups to manage.]

atari at L12 and connect instead. P10 is a nice forcing move, but it
doesn't have a lot of value in the current fight. See the variation.]
;W[mf];B[ld];W[om];B[mp];W[np];B[mq]C[patrickb: small. Now when w decends to O2, he threatens to erase territory on both sides.]
;W[ln];B[nr]TR[qn][pp][pq]C[Matteo> Bad move! I helped white getting strong against my group.

;W[ii];B[hi]C[patrickb: good.];W[ig];B[ij]C[Matteo> I thought: "I won.. cutted..." I was wrong

the lower right hand corner was the killer, and I think you could
probably have saved it. You seem to be looking for complex moves, which
is good, but make sure that the simple move doesn't work before you try
to find something complicated.])
