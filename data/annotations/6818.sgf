Thanks for giving me the opportunity to review another game. It is always fun, and educational, even for the reviewer :)]
;B[qd];W[dd]C[Gwyel [-\]: have a good game];B[pq]C[Aki [13k?\]: You too.]
;W[dp]C[Gwyel [-\]: I just got deja vu];B[od]C[Aki [13k?\]: lol]
;W[qo];B[qk];W[oo];B[mp];W[op];B[oq];W[qq];B[jq];W[jo];B[fq]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[cj];W[ej];B[cf];W[gc]LB[fc:A]
C[al> white streches a bit too far to secure the corner. if that was the purpose, the stone should have been placed at A.]
;B[dh];W[fh];B[jc];W[je];B[cm]TR[ej][fh][je][jo]C[al> Up until move #14 the game looked pretty normal. Now, with the white triangle marked stones played on top of the black stones along the board edges, it appears as if white is trying to make a moyo in the center. This is, of course, extremely difficult, and even so, it would be wise of white to make some bases at the edge of the board first - it is almoste impossible to live inside an area completely surrounded by enemy stones.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[kp];B[kq]TR[ip][jo][kp]LB[io:1][jp:A][ko:2]C[Aki [13k?\]: I'm not doing too good...

al> The three tringle marked stones have an unfortunate shape, in that if black plays at A, there are two cuts (numbered) to protect. (This happens a move #97, which proves the point, even if black fumbles it)]
;W[hp];B[gp];W[ld]SQ[ej][fh][je]TR[fp][fq][go][gp]LB[hq:A][lc:B]
[md:C]C[al> White has a chance to cut at A, separating the black  stones into two groups. The leftmost group (trianlges) can of course run out into the center, but now white's square marked stones would serve the purpose of preventing the black group from connecting to the left.

al> if the aim with white M16 is to split the black stones at K17 and P16, it is placed a little off. It would do a better job at B or C. Since black can run along the border with a one space extension, the resulting shape gets hard to attack.]
;B[lc]C[Gwyel [-\]: actually];W[mc]C[Gwyel [-\]: this is going well]
;B[md]C[Aki [13k?\]: i have a feeling you're tearing me apart]
;W[kc];B[lb]C[Gwyel [-\]: you're underestimating yourself];W[mb]
LB[kb:A]C[al> White N18 at A would be from the right direction. Now, the two white stones are doomed.]
;B[kb];W[kd];B[nc];W[nb]C[al> white O18 does not accomplish anything other than making black reinforce the top right corner. When a group is beyond salvation, like the triangle marked group, it is better to leave it, instead of forcing the opponent to capture. Even if it gets captured in the end, it may serve the purpose of a ko threat, or use as leverage for doing something nearby.]
;B[ob];W[me];B[nd];W[of];B[pf];W[pg];B[qf];W[qg]SQ[of]TR[pg]
LB[og:A]C[al> by descending instead of preventing the cut at A, white creates a weakness that puts both marked groups at risk, and it can be exploited by  black to reach out into the center, destroying white's potential territory there.]
;B[bd];W[cd]LB[cc:A]C[al> white's potential territory in the upper left corner is suddenly much smaller. To save as much as possible, white should answer at A instead of C16. NOw black can reach under the white stones further into the corner.]
;B[be];W[hq];B[hr];W[gr];B[rh];W[ok];B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[rg]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[qi];W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[oh]LB[og:A][rf:B]C[Aki [13k?\]: this is tricky

al> white has to play at A to connect to  the white stones outside, or at B to make the second eye, in order to save the group.]
;W[oe];B[rf];W[pe]LB[og:A]C[al> A was the critical point.];B[og]
;W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[re];W[ne]SQ[qd]TR[pf][qf][re][rf]MA[md]
[nc][nd][od]LB[rd:A]C[al> W O15 is not necessary to protect from a black cut, since the X marked black group only has two liberties. By playing #82 at A instead, white would capture either the triangle marked group, or the square marked stone. In the latter case, even, the rest of black's stones at the top right would be in jeopardy.]
;B[oc];W[jb]SQ[mb][mc][nb]LB[rd:A]C[al> Of course, a white cut at A is still severe.
al> K18 is a wasted stone that does not accomplish anything useful for white, as it will immediately be captured, and even helping black extend to the left along the top into white's potential territory.]
;B[ib];W[ic];B[ja];W[mh];B[qc];W[gn];B[fr];W[ir];B[ho];W[hn]
;B[io];W[in];B[jp];W[hs];B[gq]C[al> Black G3 is a mistake, as it removes one of the black group's liberties...]
;W[hr];B[jr]SQ[gr][hp][hq][hr][hs][ip][ir]TR[fp][fq][fr][go]
[gp][gq][ho][io]LB[er:A][es:C][fs:B][gs:3][is:2][js:1]C[Aki [13k?\]: I don't think I'm good enough to play you yet.
Gwyel [-\]: don't say that
Gwyel [-\]: the point is learning

al>...something that gives white the means to kill the black group even though it may look as if black has the upper hand.

al> The triangle marked black group has three liberties. The square marked white group appears to have only two, but it has, effectively, three (numbered in the diagram), in that black has to make an extra move to reach under at J1 or G1. So, white A forces black to play at B to stop white from escaping, and the follow up of white at C causes black to self-atari if he attempts to play at 3.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[lp];B[ko];W[jn];B[mn]C[Aki [13k?\]: damn...]
;W[lq];B[no];W[kr];B[mq];W[js]C[Gwyel [-\]: I should say " I don't think I'm good enough to play you yet."
Aki [13k?\]: How do you figure? You're in the lead as far as I can tell.]
;B[on];W[pn]LB[bc:B][cp:A][qr:C]C[Gwyel [-\]: you have 3 corners

al> in fact, white does not "have" any corner at this point. There is potential that may be secured by playing at A, B or C, but the only corner white has any kind of grip on is the lower right, which is worth about 10 points. If black plays any of these points first, however, it will cause serious harm to white in the corners.]
;B[pm]C[Gwyel [-\]: atm
Aki [13k?\]: I don't consider bottom right or top left mine yet
Gwyel [-\]: I guess I overplayed little bit..];W[om];B[nn];W[jd]
;B[hb];W[jb];B[ma];W[sf];B[rd]C[Aki [13k?\]: This is fun, if a bit nerver-racking.]
;W[kl]C[Aki [13k?\]: Sorry I'm taking so long
Gwyel [-\]: no worries];B[mj]C[al>  Possibly, it would have been better to reach from the bottom, to N8, making use of the threat of capturing the white stones at P7 and P9.]
