C[I'm playing as black.  Any advice would be helpful.  One question would be which stage of the game (opening, middle, or endgame) am I losing the most points on or not placing enough emphasis on?  Where are the big loss of points occurring?

Hi - while you made several end game moves that cost you the game, in my opinion your biggest problems lie with your middle game decisions.  This is true of you, of me, and of amateurs stronger than me.  It is unquestionably the most compicated part of the game.  

Having said that, I think your intuition is good and I like your style.  Your attacking in this game was great, but you would make 5 great attacking moves followed by one big mistake that made the first 5 moves irrelevant.  You just need to sharpen up your focus a little.

I have included comments and variations where I thought they could be of use.

Good luck and look for me on IGS (criminal) or KGS (sergeant).  I will be happy to play a game with you.]
;B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[qd];B[cj]C[
Although I cannot tell you exactly why this is not considered optimal, the usual play would be at C11.  (You would then be playing what is called the Chinese Opening)]
;W[ic]C[Should I now play something like K3 or O3 on the bottom or is D15 or C15 better?

I like your move.  If you don't enclose the corner, white will put pressure on it and likely find a way to develop his top right stones in the process.]
;B[de];W[iq]LB[qj:A]C[At this point in the opening, what are the best options.  I wanted to prevent white from enclosing the corner with P16 or P17 but I could also plan to attack the white stone at J17 with a move like M17 and then play P17

A piece of advice:  Don't worry about corner territory too much in the opening.  Personally, I like a splitting move at A to keep white from trying to make a huge moyo. (see my variation - you have a couple of variations played out yourself here)]

(;B[od];W[mc]C[Should I play P17 or Q17 here, aiming to keep the white stones separated?

Actually the two joseki that come to mind here are at O15 and R17. (there are many joseki, but see variations for two possibilities)

Your two suggestions - P17 and Q17 - both keep white from connecting, but they are "thank you"moves.  Once white fixes his corner after either move, you would be left with heavy stones.]

(;B[pf];W[oc];B[pd];W[pc];B[qe];W[rd]TR[od][pd][qe][pf]C[What is a proper extension from the Black Q16 group?  R8 maybe?

First, this exchange was very bad for you.  Trying to convert the marked stones into territory will be very hard since white can slide in underneath.]
;B[qn];W[ql]C[Fortunately, white makes a mistake.  The pincer is a fighting move, but you can see that you have more stones to fight with in this area than he does.  Hence, you should be able to get something out of this.]
;B[on];W[np]
(;B[mn]C[I think you should try to attack first.  See variation.]
;W[lp];B[rp]C[Perhaps R10 instead of S4?

Yes - I think R10 is better here.];W[qi];B[qq];W[pq];B[qr]C[I don't understand this move (R2).  Are you trying to kill white?  I don't think you will be able to.  If you are just trying to make territory, R2 is small - an end game move.]
;W[pr]
(;B[rl]C[Is there better way to attack the two white stones instead of S8?  Or is it a hopeless cause?

The proverb "don't  touch weak stones for it makes them strong" is in general true.  See variation for one possibility.]
;W[rk];B[rm];W[pk];B[nd];W[nc];B[oi];W[nk];B[pj]C[This move (Q10) was mean't to be an attack, but it seems I only strengthened white.

Right -- seems awkward.];W[qj]
(;B[ej];W[oh];B[nh];W[og];B[of]C[I think O13 better.];W[ng]
C[Now you have two weak groups to worry about.  Sometimes better to just give up a few stones than to try to save everything.]
;B[qg];W[mh];B[re];W[fq]
(;B[dq]C[This D3 move seems to be slow to me.

No seems ok here.  See varation.];W[fc];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[dg]

(;B[cf]C[This C14 move seems to be too slow.  Would the variation I list be better?

Yes I think so.  See comment at end of variation.];W[cg];B[fd]
;W[gd];B[fe];W[fg];B[ge];W[hd];B[go];W[hp];B[gj]C[Nice attack. :-)  But you need to keep attacking.  You let up in a few moves.]
;W[hg]
(;B[in]C[Here you must play at J14.  After white fixes his problem here there is nothing else to go after.  See varaition.]
;W[ih];B[ij];W[ki]C[At this point I wish I would have played k8]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[ef];W[di];B[dj];W[fh]C[Here again I wish I would have played something like k8]
;B[ec];W[hk]C[How should I handle this white invasion?

See comments a few nodes down.];B[hj];W[il]
(;B[fk]C[This seems very slow.  See variation.];W[gm];B[em]
;W[hn];B[ho];W[io]
(;B[jo]C[Don't atari just because you can.  Extending is better here.]
;W[ip];B[kn];W[im];B[jn];W[kl];B[mo];W[mp]
(;B[pn]C[In hindsight, this Q6 move does not seem necessary and would have been an opportunity for me to play something like E2.

Hmm.. interesting.  See variation.];W[nm];B[oo];W[er];B[dr]

If you want to play in the top left, I think G18 slightly better.  See variation.]
