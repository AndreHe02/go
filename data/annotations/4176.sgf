Further updates
----------------------
I have marked up the solid territory, which comes out to 20 points.  But you use 3 moves to secure the area, suggesting each move comes out to slightly less than 7 points.  So the game move is not worth 20 points.  More like 7 points instead.  Besides, the two marked black stones are too closed to each other.  Not an efficient move.

Another concept you might want to think about is that the game move is a single purpose move.  It is a purely territory play.  It doesn't put pressure on any white stones, nor it expands any moyo framework.  There are more opportunities during the opening to play multi-purpose moves.  Aim to find those moves in your game.

A is a double-purpose move.  It aims to capture the white stone at C if white doesn't response.  Also, it serves to build up the framework with the two black stones in the lower right corner.

Also, white just played the '1' stone.  It is common to answer his move with A in sente, expanding your framework.  If white invades, having an extra stone at A allows black to attack more aggressively.  It is part of a pattern recognition.  If you haven't seen tihs move before, it is unlikely you will think of this move during the game.

Unless a move is urgent during the opening, a move like enclosing a corner or approaching is biggest.  By playing the game move, white can play D instead.  Not only does he secure 12 points in the corner (or 6 points per move), he also exerts influence in the E and F areas.  So enclosing a corner is a big move.]

;W[lk];B[km];W[lj];B[jd];W[mi]LB[lc:A]C[This exchange is good for white.  White is very thick at the center.  The invasion around A becomes more severe.]
;B[ej]LB[de:A][cq:B]TR[ej]C[A is bigger.  I assume black is interested in reducing white's terroritory, but it is not achieving much.  For example, a move around A by white can secure the corner.  Whereas a move by white at the marked black stone position doesn't get much.  Black can still invade at B.]
;W[cf];B[cq]LB[ci:A][ck:B]C[I did not know how to follow up E10

That's a good observation.  If a move doesn't have a good follow up, it's probably not a good move.  The usual approach is to follow up at A or B.  That requires reading, but I don't think either point will do much damage to white.]
