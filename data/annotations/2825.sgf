My name is Barry and I am rated ~ 8k on KGS.   Please keep in mind that my suggestions and comments may help in some ways, but the advice is only as good as my rank...  I will mark my comments with  *.

If you have any questions about the review or other games you wish me to comment on, feel free to contact me at bconwil@aol.com.

Overall you played good game.  It could have gone either way.  I've tried to hit on the big points.  Try to keep in mind the entire board when choosing your battles and how to set them up. Play agressively close to your strength and lightly next to your opponents strength.  Keep enjoying the game. 

One of the best pieces of general advice I can offer is from a book I recently read.  The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move? 
    a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."]

;B[en]C[Telach [16k\]: yeah so it seems];W[em]CR[co]C[*  This is an unusual move for white.  Joseki would have been at c5.  I would have moved at c5 instead of f7.   "My enemy's best move is my best move" (see variation)]

(;B[fm];W[gp];B[ip]C[I thought this move was playing too close to thickness on my opponents part.

* Yes I think you are right.  J4 was not  a bad move, but I like to make sure that I don't end up with weak groups at the beginning.  So if you are3 going to attack make sure that you keep good shape with your groups.  I might have moved at c5 before j4.  Remember to attack from a position of strength.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[iq];B[hq];W[io];B[hp]C[* nice move.  White is now split and you have him on the run.]
;W[ho];B[go];W[fo];B[gn];W[gq];B[hr];W[fn]CR[gm]C[* Your next move was g7; however, I would have reacted differently.  You allowed white to contol the flow. Perhaps a move at f4 (See the next variation)  White made an overplay and got away with it this time.]

(;B[gm];W[do]TR[gm]SQ[gn][go]C[those two stones are unsavable, and had i not protected with the marked stone, he could have double ataried and caught, the square marked stones in a ladder saving his stones there

;W[eo];B[fp];W[eh]
(;B[dg]C[*  Not a good move choice.   The board is much to open for a move that is neither urgent or big.. This just allows white to solidify his territory.  Early moves can be very important.  Remember..urgent ?  big?   moyo?]
;W[dh];B[cd]CR[cc]
(;W[dc]C[* white should have moved at c17];B[cc]C[* not a bad move, but you did lose sente.  Don't give it up unless you have to.]
;W[hd];B[ek];W[dk];B[el];W[dl];B[jp]C[*This move was a little slow.  Once a group is safe, try to develop other areas more quickly.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[qp];B[qq];W[rq];B[rp]CR[pq]C[* This move might have been better at q3.  By driving white up the side you would have made a huge moyo.]

(;B[qp];W[oq];B[rr];W[ps];B[mq]C[This was an attempt to cut off his room to make a base
* This was a good plan, but remember you don' need to kill groups to win the game.   If you can keep white from breaking into the center, you will have a huge area.]
;W[nq];B[np];W[mr];B[lr]C[*  This was a somewhat critical mistake.  It allowed white to break into the center which caused you a lot of problems later in the game.  You should have moved at m3.  Let white live small while you build some great thickness.]

C[* you should have blocked at q8 instead of descending to s7 (see variation)]

(;B[rm];W[nh]
(;B[jc]CR[jd]C[*  This move is more of an invasion as opposed to a reduction move.  I think you would have been better off moving at k16. (See variation)

If you don't think you can invade and live, try to reduce from the outside.]

(;B[ib]C[* While it is ususally god to grab a base for a set of stones, you won't live  by establishing a base for this group.  Keep running toward the center.]

(;B[ha];W[ka]C[should've played there instead
