marbun [8k\]: hi gg];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[pc]C[I see a lot of players playing this move. As I understand it it's not a good move. Am I right? Distance for attack and contact for defence.

> you are correct, it's not a move I would play too often, it almost forces white to become stronger, but you can play it if you want to experiment or if you are uncomfortable with the local joseki.]
;W[pd]TR[pp]C[> this response is a bit strange, you are pretty much giving up the corner in exchange for influence, but note that the marked black stone already somewhat counters your influence.
Playing at R17 for example makes more sense.];B[qc];W[qh];B[qj]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[qm]LB[rc:A]C[>here you can see the consequences of what I previously staded. White has not built up much from his influence, he even looks a bit overconcentrated. While black is developing quickly.
Note that it is now rather big for white to play at A. But it might not be the best play at this moment, just keep it in mind.]
;W[dj];B[cn]
(;W[pq]C[but i saw once a high dan play this against this kind of half enclosure, even though its a contact play

>It s good to try :) however, imagine playing on R3 instead. Black sealing you in is good for him and bad for you, the same can happen with this contactplay. I would prefer to play K3 .]
(;B[qp]TR[pp][qm]C[> this black play is bad, it makes overconcentrated shape and the overall orientation is wrong.]
;W[oq];B[qq];W[lq];B[fq];W[cq]C[is it possible to live here?

> I don't really think so, but it can serve as aji later. I wouldn't play it I think. You can't have everything, and it s probably better to first play at H3 or J3]
