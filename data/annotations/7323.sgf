C[Dear reviewer,

In this game, i played white and i lost :-(
I think I lost the game because i spent too many moves on the center black group.
Please, help me to find out my mistakes.

Thomas

Kyle: I'm happy to review your game.];B[qc]C[fantomas27 [1d\]: hi gg]
;W[dp]C[miliot [1d\]: hi];B[qq];W[dc];B[ce];W[dh]C[since my opponent played two sansans i wanted to attack asap.

Kyle: Good balance.  Two-space low or one-space low can also be played here and is probably more "correct' because of the low position of the Black stones on the right.]

(;B[eg]LB[bi:A]C[Kyle: Too early.  It will be a burden for W to pull these stones out.  Just extend here, the hane is painful.

Even if B wants to capture here, B should atari at A first]

W has fallen behind]

(;W[dm]C[with this move all my groups are connected and only remains the weak black group, that's what i thought

Kyle: The B group is very light, so this is like playing on dame points.  Take more outside influence and make B connect instead.]
