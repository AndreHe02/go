C[Hello,
I took black in this New Jersey Open game against an AGA  7k and lost. Please give me pointers on where I could have played better.
Thanks... Zee

First of all, I am only 2K myself in Germany, so I might not be able to comment about subtle Fuseki issues.

However, let me give it a try.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk]
;W[qf]CR[qh]C[Black should be able to punish white for this.
Maybei R12 would have been better response!

The normal approach for White would be the outside.]
(;B[nd]C[Does not look like a big mistake.

However, it makes it easy for White to get himself settled.

Actually, I do not know a better move myself.];W[rd]
(;B[jp]CR[qc]C[I thought this is bigger than R17.

No you should continue and the Joseki. Moreover K4 is very vague. White can invade at Q5 ans spoil everything. K4 is not on the right spot, as we will see.]
;W[po];B[np]C[See, the connection between O4 and K4 is not good.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[rr]TR[oq]MA[lp]C[This leaves Aji at P3. We will see later, how this will affect the game, when White invades at M3.

On th eother hand, it undermines White.];W[qm];B[qh];W[qc]
(;B[fq]C[Is this good timing? Or is it better to approach in the top left?

I think you must do something for your two top stones. You cannot treat them lightly as you do.]
;W[dn];B[cf]C[Again, wrong direction. You must find a way to make your stones work together.]
;W[ci];B[ef];W[fd];B[hc]
(;W[gc]C[Bad.];B[hd];W[cd];B[gf];W[oc];B[nc]C[Not my style of play. Gives White a grand corner]
;W[fj]C[Too lofty.

Black can invade too easily.];B[dr]C[Is this too small now?

No, but due to K4, is is not too effective. However, it is big enough.]

(;W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[Not good, but you have Aji in the corner to take care of.]
;W[kq];B[mq];W[kp];B[cq]C[Good.];W[cp];B[iq];W[no];B[ok]C[Are you afraid?

Right so, but this is not sente, so the move is really small.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[mp];B[nq];W[pc]C[Likewise too small.];B[mo]C[This is a mistake.

Yes.];W[mn]
(;B[hj]C[No.

This spoils your chances to invade to the right, and is too loft to make big a Moyo of your own.]
;W[jo]C[Too small.];B[io]C[Likewise. Too small.];W[jn]C[Another small move.

The top is important.]
(;B[fo];W[in]C[White shows no sense for the important things.]
;B[fm]C[Yep.];W[el];B[hn]C[Too small.]
(;W[kj]C[Wrong order of moves.];B[kh];W[mj]C[This is not good. Tame, and does not make territory.]
;B[mh];W[ii]
(;B[ji]C[Don't get carried away.];W[jj];B[ij];W[ki];B[jh];W[lh]
;B[lg];W[li]
(;B[og]C[Better a tight and secure move.];W[od];B[oe];W[ne]
C[Bad.]
(;B[me];W[gb];B[hb];W[nf];B[of];W[mf]
(;B[lf]C[You must be careful!];W[nb];B[lc]C[A bad mistake, costing a lot of points!]
;W[md];B[le];W[mc]C[Now black is much behind. He could just as well resign.

White has 20 points to the left, 20 in the top left, 10 in the top right and another at least 15  in the center. With 65 points, you win.

Black cannot cope with this. Moreover all his territory is open.]
