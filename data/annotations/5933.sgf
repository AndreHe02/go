[Peti\] Dear reviewer!
This game was played on KGS me being black.
The game started unusually and I ended up having a huge moyo, which got unfortunately invaded. So my main question is: how I should have responded to the invasion? Is W130 killable?
The rest of the game I was trying to realize as much of my influence as possible but I couldn't turn back the game and lost by 9.5 pts.
Thanks for your time!
I'll mark my comments with [Peti\].];B[dd]C[The tradition is to start in upper right corner - with the attack on the opponent heart.]
;W[qc]C[Peti29 [8k\]: gg];B[pd]C[Empty corner is considerred to be bigger than kakari.]
;W[cq];B[pq];W[oc]C[ [Peti\] The 3-3 was a strange start to me so I decided to cover it to gain influence.
I wasn't prepared for P17, I expected Q17 or R17. I didn't know how to respond so I decided to peek in and see what happens.]

C[[Peti\] The roles have changed at the top: I ended up having little territory and white ended up having influence. O14 was to regain my influence and decrease his.

O14 is a good move.];W[qo]

(;B[lm]C[[Peti\] He ruined my top-right territory but I built a nice wall and he was left with a weak group between two of my strong groups. I was happy.

This is certainly a good result for black.];W[ki];B[jl];W[mi]

(;B[kh];W[ji];B[ij];W[ih];B[jf]C[[Peti\] I wanted to ruin his influence up there.

White has no more influence there. it was there, but you diminished it with o14 move. Later it was not so terrific.]

;W[bj];B[cl];W[bl];B[cm];W[bm];B[cn];W[jp]C[[Peti\] Now I had a huge moyo at the bottom and I knew an invasion was to come. I thought I could kill w130 (K4) but I failed. Maybe I should've responded M3?

Looks like white can live there or al least reduce considerably, but I would start with l3 or k3.]

(;B[io];W[ho]C[[Peti\] J5 was a mistake, I knew he lived now. From now on I was to realize as much territory as I can. Did I have any chance to turn the game from now?
My comments end here. Thanks for the review!

White is not completely alive, but he is close to the life


you have much less territory than white at the moment
white about 45 at the board, black about  25  - big difference

So you need to try something special to gain some points.]
