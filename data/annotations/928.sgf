C[Review requested by Martin Gruber (B)

performed by Neil Mitchison

(Niall 6k* on igs)];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[ec]C[NM: Good, because it is also an

extension from Q16];W[oq]C[NM: Playable, but perhaps less

good because D3 doesn't point in this

direction, and because it allows B

to play D15 and press the C16 stone

severely.];B[op]C[NM: This is playable, but not quite to

my taste Although this move works quite well with Q16, it also strengthens the P3 stone a lot.]
;W[np];B[oo];W[pq];B[qq];W[kq];B[ee]C[NM: Good - though I think D15 would

have been even better.];W[dc]C[NM: Better C14];B[cf]C[NM: I think this leaves E17 etc. a bit

too weak. I would have played E18 here.

This is not bad, in that it tries to

confine the C16 stones, but it isn't

really consistent with the apparent

"moyo" strategy of B.];W[ed];B[fd];W[dd];B[fc]C[NM: I would prefer F15 - if W wants

to play F17 and take the B stone,

(or better to play F18)

we let him - he's safe in the corner

anyway.];W[de];B[df]C[NM: I would play E14 and encourage W to cut at C13 and take a few points on the side while B builds a huge moyo ...]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[be];B[eg]C[NM: Possible, but vulnerable to a later

ladder-breaker. I would play C11

and let W try and pull E14 out if he wants to - B will make territory on

one side or the other.];W[bf];B[bg]C[NM: Too small. Better to take the W stone with F14, or to play tenuki.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[NM: This is a rare case when Q4 may be better than R5, because of the shortage of liberties of the P3 stones it induces. But R5 is reasonable.]
;W[qk];B[qh]C[NM: Good - there's no immediate

danger to the corner, so attack.];W[eb];B[ol]C[NM: Ut is difficult to know how to attack these stones. I would be inclined to play tenuki for that reason.]
;W[nc];B[kc]C[NM: Now that W has ignored the B attack at P8, I think B has to continue it - e.g. with S7.]
;W[fb];B[gb]C[NM: This is gote, and doesn't even block W totally (with the aji of the E14 stone, W can play H18).

Better would have been P17, or (in

descending order) Q17, L15, J17 or tenuki.];W[qf]C[NM: I like this W move - complicating things nicely, and requiring strategic thought....]
;B[pf]C[NM: A joseki response, but it doesn't look good to me in this context: it allows W to take territory while strengthening his R9 group. I would prefer P12 or Q13.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[qd];B[qc];W[pe];B[oe];W[qe];B[oc];W[rc];B[qb]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[pk];W[ql]C[NM: And W has all the territory, with no weak stones. Against which B has a lovely wall, but that can be difficult to exploit properly.]
;B[dl]C[NM: Not a bad means to exploit the wall; I think my preference would have been something like L14 first of all.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[hc]C[MG: This starts the first very unsatisfying sequence



NM: Yes, I understand your feeling.

Now that you've played D8 and stand to make good territory on the L side, I'd think about answering this with something like J16, allowing W to take your G18 stone.]
;B[gc];W[hb];B[ga]C[NM: Much better F19, which is nearly sente against the E18 stones.]
;W[he];B[hg];W[ke];B[le];W[ld];B[kd];W[me];B[je]C[NM: I think leading out at M14 may be playable, but certainly after this you have to lead out the L17 stones.]
;W[lf];B[ng]C[NM: I suppose this was played because you were anxious about the cut at Q12, but you shouldn't have been - if he cuts you let him take the R12 stones.

You should play J16 here.];W[jd];B[id];W[jc];B[jb]C[NM: As you found out, this doesn't work; J17 would have been better.]
;W[ic];B[ia];W[ie];B[jf];W[kb];B[ha];W[cb];B[lb]C[NM: small. C5 was bigger.]
;W[lc];B[ka];W[ig];B[if];W[hf];B[gg];W[jg]C[MG: what went wrong here?

NM: Well, it was a somewhat pointless

fight from your point of view. Saving the K15 stones gains you very little, since the H15 group is already alive.

But if you really want to, you have to answer H14 with K13.]
;B[do]C[NM: Good! I would have a slight preference for C5, but the difference

is largely a matter of taste.];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[bn];W[fq]
;B[iq]C[NM: Very agressive, but - I admit - it's my sort of move.]
;W[eo];B[dp]C[NM: Silly!];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[io];W[ko];B[jm]
;W[in];B[jn];W[hn];B[jo];W[mi]C[MG: what about my following moves?



NM: well, it's a tricky situation. You try and kill the W stone; you don't succeed, but you make a reasonable wall round it. I don't myself see any straighforward way to kill it.

The question is whether you should have tried directly at all. I would have played H10 first of all, and only if he failed to answer that tried to kill N11 (and if he does answer, H10 is a big territorial move in sente).]

;B[il];W[kl];B[ik];W[km];B[kn];W[ml];B[nm];W[lk];B[mj]C[NM: Doesn't work, therefore O10 would

be better - but even that should be kept as a BIG ko threat.]
;W[nj];B[nk];W[ni]C[MG: wasn`t this life to easy?



He settled 2 living groups in my main sphere of influence.



Something must have gone wrong!



NM: Well, I don't think it was ever going to be possible to kill that stone... but you're not badly off. In particular the W O4 group looks attackable, and you should be able to make lots of territory on the L side...]
;B[gj]C[NM: A little too close for my taste, but the principle is sound.]

;W[bo];B[cm];W[bq];B[cq]C[MG: I didn`t see the danger



NM: Watch out for shortage of liberties! At best C3 gains you a point...]
;W[br];B[cs];W[fs];B[gs];W[ar];B[fl]C[MG: until it was to late]
;W[as];B[mp]C[MG: is there a better attacking move?



NM: I don't see one now; I don't think N3 works.];W[mq];B[no]
;W[lp];B[nq];W[nr];B[np]C[NM: Why not fight the ko?];W[pr]C[MG: is the white group save now?



NM: Looks it to me - one eye at P2, the other at or near N2. :-(]
;B[gm];W[fs];B[rb]C[NM: Good. Very big.];W[rd]C[NM: W shouldn't reply here - S2 is bigger, and his group is in no danger.]
;B[oi]C[NM: I don't see any danger to your group, so R2, S7 or O18 would be bigger.]

;W[ah];B[ai];W[af];B[bi];W[an];B[am];W[ao];B[mr]C[MG: I wasn´t sure who had more points at this time, so I tried something whithout seeing a real chance



(sorry to my opponent)



NM: It was a nice attack - although W

can defend against it, B gains something anyway, and the defence is not obvious. Well done!]
;W[lq];B[ms]
(;W[ns]C[NM: Of course this should be M2

(see variation).];B[os];W[or];B[pp];W[lr];B[ps]C[MG: nevertheless I think I´m weak in close combat. do you have some hints to improve in this field ?



bye, magruber



NM: Ooo, difficult to give hints on the basis of one game. I think that your faults are those of most players of your strength; I really don't see anything special.]
