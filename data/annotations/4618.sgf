AB[pd][dp][pp]C[K- this game ended up close but had moments when it looked as though each player might get a decisive win. First it looked as though black wasn't going to stop white getting a large territory at the top, later white nearly lost a large group.

Both of us made mistakes and lost groups we shouldn't really have lost.

M- I agree with many of your comments. I have tried to point out some strategic considerations as you asked. Hope this helps.]
PL[W];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[cf];W[ee];B[dj];W[nc];B[kd]C[K- this turned out to be a very significant move in terms of the shape of the game later on

M- I am not sure that this is the best move in this situation. It is a joseki for the upper right but it starts to look weak after w's next move. It's merit is that it tends to prevent from making a large scale moyo at the top. However, b's subsequent play is not consistant with this strategy.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kf];B[jp]LB[kd:A]C[
M- This is a good move by itself and represents a good strategy in handicap games of mapping out influence rather than fighting with w. However, A is looking like it will be captured on a large scale. As noted earlier, A is justified to prevent a large scale moyo at the top, so either A is a mistake or b should try to save or use A.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[qn]
(;B[nq]C[
M- Not that the game move is wrong, but I might have played the alternate line here.]
;W[rp];B[cq]LB[qq:A]C[K- I view this as the end of the opening, in that this move forced white to launch a determined attack on the lower left quarter of the board, which in turn dictated how the wholly rest of the game developed

M- A is joseki for the corner, but not absolutely required. The game move has merit. Other moves in this corner are also reasonable.]
;W[ck]LB[cj:A]C[K- this proved surprisingly difficult to respond to, and same again later for a similar attack on the bottom side. In this case I decided to play for corner territory and influence, conceding the side

M- That seems a mistake to me. It is generally best to play on the weaker side of an invading stone. Your corner with its stone on the 3-3 is inherently stronger and is farther away from the enemy stone. Your side group is weaker because its stones are more loosely connected and have enemy stones on both sides. If you lose the side group, b's moyo on top gets really big.  I would play at A, making for a good extension from your 2 stone wall.]

[kd:C]C[
M-  Lets evaluate the board at this point. b and w's positions on the right are more or less similar. If w captures b's weak stones at A-C, w will have a much bigger area at the top and left than b has at bot and left. w has a less secure hold on his moyo at this point, but w is the stronger player so presumably he will have the advantage in the fighting. I think w has substantially reduced the value of the handicap stones at this point.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[eh];W[dg];B[em];W[dl];B[en]LB[fn:A]C[K- didn't want to leave this cutting point in case of W E8, B F8.

At this point I had a good wall so expected an attack on the bottom side, and sure enough...

M- I agree about cutting pt., but anticipating w e8, would be better at A]
;W[iq]C[K- this time I played it differently. I prevented white making an easy base at the side, hoping to push him into the centre and use my wall. Didn't quite work as intended but the thought was there...

M- sounds like a good plan.];B[jq];W[ip];B[gq]LB[jn:A]C[
M- You could consider a move at A to map out a larger territory to the right. w will try to build a base to the left, but you can still attack him.]
;W[jo];B[ko];W[gp];B[fp];W[jn];B[go]LB[kn:A]C[
M- A is better here. It builds your position while leaning on w.  Your move keeps w from getting eyes, but it doesn't really add anything to your position and he is going to escape into the center when he bends around you in the next move.]
;W[kn];B[lo]C[
M-  w is using his weak group to force you instead of you chasing his weak group.]
;W[ho]C[K- here I was stuck for a good continuation locally. My next move was played purely out of courtesy, didn't want my opponent to fall asleep while I was deep in thought, so played a "simple" move, planning to come back to this area later.

In retrospect I think I should have played H4 here (as I did when coming back in a few moves time)

M- I disagree, H4 seems small to me at this point.];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[cd];W[eg];B[fh];W[fg];B[hp]LB[kj:A][jj:B]C[
M- this still seems small to me  The action is in the center now. Something like Aor B would be a good extension for w and therefore are vital points for you too.]
;W[jr]
(;B[lq]LB[kr:A]C[
M- I think you safely block at A for a few more points. See alternate.]
;W[hn];B[mm];W[bg];B[bf];W[cg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]LB[hh:A]
[pb:B]C[K- at this point I was desperately trying to work out what to do about the top side, as it stands it is a huge area for white

M- It really is his now. the best you can do is reduce his moyo at the edges with moves like A or B]
;B[im]LB[hl:A][hh:B]C[K- an experimental move, of which my opponent immediately showed me the weakness...

M- Yes, this move is too close to w and has no clear relationship to your postions. You have to think that w is going to escape or live here and it is only a question of what your attacking moves are going to build for you at the same time. A move like A might work well with B which you want to do anyway.]

C[K- this was the start of my troubles in this corner. I had thought it secure, but evidently I did not play it right, and it ended up as a ko for life

M- Yes, this corner needed one more stone to be secure.];B[bd]
;W[ce];B[ae];W[de];B[mf]C[K- going for reduction rather than rescue here

;W[nf];B[in]LB[rb:A][rk:B][bl:C]C[K- thought it was time to steal some eyes

M- OK, but w can make 2 eyes so what is the point? A-C are bigger.
Subsequent events make me take back this comment.];W[io];B[jm]
;W[mk];B[mc];W[jc];B[oc];W[ob]C[K- this was white's big mistake this game, we agreed afterwards

M- Sure is. w needed to be thinking about how to connect all of his stones and keep yours separated.]

;B[kc];W[mg];B[lg];W[mh];B[mi]LB[ke:A]C[K- this was forcing me to play where I wanted, if I could get N10 and L10, black's large lower-centre group would have a struggle to make 2 eyes

M-  hmm. I just realized how insecure w's group is. The cutting pt at A is also interesting.
