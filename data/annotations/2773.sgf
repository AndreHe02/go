C[Arend: I think you didn't attack W severely enough in several places where W left weak groups behind, and played a little too slowly a couple of times. However, W missed his chances to
strengthen his groups, and even helped you to keep them weak (with K9), so your inefficiency did not get punished.

Its hard to make general advice out of this game. Maybe one pt you can try to remember is that you should make the opponent heavy before attacking (see the possible attacks on the group on the right-hand side.)

And one comment about your comments: You seem to assume that the purpose of attacking is to kill. Almost always, however, attacking is only trying to gain points while attacking, in the best case forcing the opponent to live with 2-3 points in gote.]
;B[pp]C[Arend: First mistake :-)
Polite opening is on the lower right half of the upper right quarter of the board. I.e. Q16 if you want to open on hoshi.]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[ip];W[qn]C[Joe: I considered O4, but felt white was developing better than black
Arend: B O4 is ok, too.]
(;B[od];W[np]C[Joe: I felt that if I got out to the middle then I would be okay, white could only settle one side or the other and I would be able to pressure white appropriately, so I felt P16 gave me the option to press down on the left if necessary.]
;B[oo]C[Joe: Black is out into the middle and white can push me if he likes but he'll be cramped in the end, and R6 will get hurt, I should end with sente.]
;W[kq]C[I think black should attack the weaker stone immediately.]

(;B[jq]C[This is bad, (and white should answer it directly).]

(;W[oq];B[pq];W[no]
(;B[on]C[Arend: This is too slow.];W[pl];B[nn]C[Arend: Now this move has little effect on the O5 stones, so W can play around K3 first, which is _very_ important.]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[jp];B[iq];W[jo]C[Joe: What should black do now?  one white group look settled, and black can get two eyes on the bottom even if white moves against them next]

(;B[qo]C[Joe Settle the corner first?
Arend: I am not sure what is best. I would prefer to attack.]

(;W[io];B[qj]C[Joe: Develop the left and attack the white stones working with P16]
;W[qk];B[pj];W[nl];B[mn]C[Joe: this seems slow, but I didn't want to get enclosed.
Arend: I think this is too slow. Your corner is full alive, so you need not worry about getting enclosed.]

(;B[nd]C[Arend: This is not so urgent and Black should attack the Q8 group instead.]
;W[gp]C[Joe:  I ignored 3 moves and now I must answer, but I felt I didn't not get as much out of the tenuki's as I should have.  Should I have settled this sooner?
Arend: The white plays K2/K4/K5, J5, G4 are all very big.];B[kr]
;W[lr];B[js];W[lq];B[ho]C[Joe: Get out to the middle before settling.  Now that I look at it, it seems clear that H5 will get cut off and it can't really hurt the white group to the left, so was this unreasonable?  How should I have settled here?  It does set up a ladder that gives the black group below room to live.  But C4 gets hurt.
Arend: You should just play F3 here.];W[hp];B[hn];W[gr];B[hr]

(;W[fr];B[hs]C[Arend: It is very humilating to have to play H2 and H1 while the oppoent is strenthening his cutting stones and weakening your corner.]
;W[fn];B[hl]C[Joe: I have to run away, but this looks like Black has the weak group, not white]
;W[cn]
(;B[ep]C[Joe: Sets up a squeeze to escape or capture white, while settling the corner.
Arend: I think this is bad. You set up your own shortage of liberties.]

;W[cr];B[br];W[ds];B[bo];W[cl]
(;B[gm]C[Arend: Inefficient. As both F4 and K4 are alive, the reason why you want to save the cutting stone are the C8 stones. So F8 is better.]

(;W[or]C[Arend: This is off-topic now. White should do s.th. for his Q8 stones instead.]

(;B[nj]C[Arend: This is not severe enough.];W[ll];B[ln];W[kn]
;B[km]C[Joe: I keep doing this to seperate stones, only to later find out they are not as weak as I believed.  Is this unreasonable?]

;W[rs];B[rp]C[Joe: Did black get lucky again?
Arend: Black is very unhappy because he had to live in gote with 3 pts.]
;W[rm];B[so];W[sm];B[sn]
(;W[jk]C[Arend: The combination K9/M10 leaves too much weakness in W's shape.]
;B[hj]C[Arend: Black is grateful for the chance to strengthen his weak group. W K9 is probably the biggest mistake in this game.]
;W[lj];B[cj]C[Joe: How should black settle the middle black group?  Shoudl I be attacking like this now?  White always seems to leave weak stones behind.
Arend: After W induced H10, this attack looks almost automatic. Good move!]
;W[ek]C[Joe: Black is already out into the middle, I can ignore this and develop the left.  Right?
Arend: But you could also try to enclose white and force him to live in gote.]

(;B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[cc]
(;B[jc]C[Joe: Black could settle in the corner and get a living group, possibly giviing up C10, but the weak stone in the middle might be a burden.  I felt if White invaded at C12 I could run out and then The white stones at the top would be in  trouble.  Is this poor planning?  White has 3 weak groups and black has one in the middle.  Or am I wrong on that point as well?
Arend: You are right that you don't want to invade and give white influence with so many weak groups around. However, leaving the gap at C12 makes it a little to easy for W to settle his weak group at E7. (See variations for how W can do this.)]

(;W[df];B[cg];W[ei]C[Arend: This combination is inefficient, as Black can cut through....]

(;B[dg]C[Joe: I thought about running at H12 instead but decided on this instead]

(;W[ef]C[Arend:...but at least W should strengthen his weaker grouop, not his stronger group.]
;B[eg];W[ji];B[fj];W[ej];B[gh]
(;W[bk]C[Arend: This is apparently a mistake.];B[bc]C[Joe: I think white still only has one eye for the group on the left, and the top is still weak.  I decided to settle by group on the side, so I only had one weak group in the middle while white still had 3 weak groups

Arend: I think agree. (See variations.)]
