C[This is a game played on IGS 20k* v 20k*.  I played white and lost by 1 point (5.5 komi).  Would like some help concerning my play style as I missed some end game points and made some very bad shapes that did not help.

{You played a very interesting game and I enjoyed reviewing it.  I also think you played pretty well.

You have a very agressive style, but leave yourself thin in many places.  You need to take care of the thin positions better, I think.

When you're reading my comments, remember that I'm not such a strong player myself--if you disagree with the comments, you might well be right.  When in doubt, continue to play as you think best--if you're wrong, the opponent will show you more clearly than I ever could.

I've put all my comments in {}s to distinguish them from your questions and comments.   -edgy

{Whenever you find yourself thinking about a bad-shape move to save a couple of stones, consider sacrificing them.   White might consider giving up the N5 stones and shoring up the lower right corner (variation) or even playing in the center.

Of course, in this case, they are cutting stones, but  still, I think White gets more from playing elsewhere and taking a loss on the bottom.}]

It looks to me like Black has about 60 points, plus whatever he can add to the upper right territory, and White has  about 40 points, plus whatever he can get in the right center, plus komi.
So White needs to get about 15 points more out of the center than Black adds on the upper right. And it's Black's move.  Whiets positionis difficult.}]

*ssper*: Thanks. Good game
--> done <--

I really did poorly on endgame in retrospect, too many gote moves.  Time never became much of a factor.  Plus lost by one point but I felt I could have done much better.

{Both of you missed sente moves and big moves in the endgame, butthe endgame is hard.  I think you both played quite well--much better than 20k.  It was a very interesting game.

You played several agressive tenukis, maybe too agressive.  Mainly, you need to be more careful with the kind of thin positions you got on the right side and the bottom.  When you're thin, it's usually better to sacrifice something and make thickness and territiory than to try to save all your stones.}]
