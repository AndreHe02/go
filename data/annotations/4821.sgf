C[Joonas Tyystj√§rvi, 1D: This was a very difficult game to analyze. I've added variations where I saw possible improvements.]

(;B[dn]C[JT: This is bad, see the variation.];W[eo];B[cm];W[en]
;B[dm];W[fp]C[JT: This result is bad for black. White has too much territory and influence.]
;B[qo];W[bh]LB[bg:A][ch:B]C[this seems early, what should i counter with?

JT: the usual answers are A and B. Since black is strong in the lower left, black should cut.]

(;B[bf]LB[bg:A]C[JT: A is usually better, see the variation]
;W[dh];B[eh]LB[gf:A]C[JT: This is too focused on territory. Black should try to attack indirectly with a move like A, aiming at destroying white's moyo. See the variation on move 35.]
;W[ei];B[di];W[eg];B[ch];W[fh];B[dg]LB[fe:A]C[JT: Connecting these groups in gote is not enough compensation for white's ponnuki. Note that if white just plays A, he makes a much bigger moyo than black's territory to the left.]
;W[nq]C[this attack seems too much, what is the best counter?

JT: it's not really too much, considering white's thickness in the lower left. See the variation for the next move.]

(;B[lq]C[JT: this is an overplay, see the variation.];W[mp]

(;B[lp]C[JT: this is very heavy, see the variation.];W[lo]
(;B[mo]LB[no:A]C[JT: this is not good - black gets cut to two weak groups.]
;W[no];B[mn];W[nn];B[mm];W[ko]C[JT: this is very difficult for black now. Black is split into two weak groups.]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[ip];W[io]
(;B[mq]LB[nr:A]C[JT: This is pretty vulgar. Better to just play A, see the variation.]
;W[np];B[nm]C[JT: this is an overplay, since black can't really hope to kill white. Actually, white could kill black right now - see the variation.]

(;W[pn];B[pl];W[qn];B[ro];W[or]C[JT: this is the last chance to make life. It's very tricky, and black has to sacrifice part of the group, but at least that way it's not a disaster.]

;B[of];W[qj]LB[pe:C][kl:B][rl:D][om:A]C[how to counter, this seems too deep for me

JT: white makes the game unnecessarily difficult for himself with this, but black can't really hope to kill. The best black can hope for is to somehow push white small here and make a severe invasion to the top.]

(;B[ql]LB[qg:B][rk:A]C[JT: Although this is the strongest move, white still has moves like A and B that pretty much guarantee him life.]
;W[oj];B[mj]LB[mi:A]C[JT: I don't think it actually works, but A is a somewhat stronger attack since it pushes white against the wall.]

any overall remarks on how to improve?

JT: learn to read further, and try to take your opponent's thickness and weaknesses in your own shape into account. Try not to start big fights in places where your opponent is strong.]
