C[W: Hello. I'll start my comments with 'W' since I played white in this game. I think I lost the game due to several reading mistakes. But I'm mostly interested in the less obvious mistakes we made, like "wrong area of play". And since I suck at creating ko-fights I'd appreciate some comments that point out where they could have be started, even if they wouldn't be the best available move.

I picked the game because it wasn't decided by a single big mistake (as most of my games :-/) and tried to add my thoughts and own analysis to several positions.]
;B[pp]C[dede: Whlie preparing game for comments, pls avoid variations - it makes commenting hard.]
;W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[qi];W[dj];B[jq];W[gq]C[dede: this move looks slow. May be k17, or q15 would be better.]
;B[jc]C[dede:I think k16 looks better for Black here.];W[gc]
C[dede: This move is weak. I think White should enter right side. q-r 15, may be r6]
;B[mc]LB[qn:a][lp:b][nq:c][oi:d][md:e][jj:f]C[W: If I continue to build a framework on the left side I loose most chances to invade and I'll end up with a smaller mojo. I think possible attack points are "A" to "F". "A" is probably best because there's space for an extension along the side. In the game I picked "B" to play something less common and attempt to cut the black stone at K3. "C" and "D" force defensive moves but would have to run to the center. "E" could cut the black stones (if I were a better player) and "F" looks reasonable, but perhaps isn't ambitious enought.

dede: Black N17 is weak and should be at k5, q5, k15 or p11 . From shown moves for White, I like 'F'. Other moves are q15 and k5.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mq]LB[jp:a][mp:b]C[W: In retrospect I suppose it would have been better to build up influence with "A" or get stronger with "B".

dede: if you aimed for influence directed into the center,  yes. Also, o4 is promising.]
;B[mp];W[nq]C[dede: may be n2 would be better for White here. Anyway, before starting such operations, try to figure out what do you want to achieve. Invade and build living group down here? Center influence? Some strength to support corner invasion?]

(;W[kr];B[kp];W[lo];B[jr]
(;W[ln]TR[nq][mq][lp][lo]C[W: During the game I was afraid that an attempt to connect the marked stones would end with a trapped group and I preferred a move that gave me the possibility to continue on either side. Now I think an attempt to connect would have been better since the corner can still be easily attacked.
dede: Passive move. White  could make good position by playing n5, l5, o5 and then for instance p8]
;B[np];W[on]C[dede: White forces Black to take points on the right...Better would be k6, may be j6. If Black try to go in (with for instance h4), White has still open right side for deep reduction, like q6.]
;B[qn];W[oo];B[op];W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[qk];W[oi];B[pg];W[lj]
LB[ng:a][jh:b]C[W: Is this too small? Should I have continued with O13 ("A") or K12 ("B") instead of M10?
dede: Trying to close Black's door into your moyo with something like j5 would be best. Black is low on the top, so his reduction from that side would be less painful.]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[dede: i would choose d6 and take wall around line 'D'.Any joseki here White can finish with sente, and then play j5]
;B[en];W[fl]C[dede: c4 is good enough, and then try to prevent connection with k3 stones. Now game is hard for White to win]
;B[gn];W[io]LB[ho:a]C[W: H5 ("A") looks a little better.

;W[fp];B[fq];W[eq];B[fr];W[er];B[hm];W[in];B[gl];W[gr]LB[bo:a]
C[W: 4 points in gote are very small. I suppose B5 ("A")  is preferable and tenuki would risk the corner?
dede:  b4];B[hr];W[fs];B[gj];W[ik]C[dede: bad direction of play. Only hope for white to make some territory is top left, so push with, for instance, f11 and protect corner. The game is almost lost for White.]

(;W[bq]C[W: Now I'd prefer B7... (see variation)
dede: yes];B[bm];W[bl];B[fk];W[cg];B[el]C[dede: from my point of view, the game is lost for White. Black can still invade top left corner, and Black's territory is unsheakable]

(;B[db]C[W: As my opponent pointed out after the game the group would have lived after B15.
