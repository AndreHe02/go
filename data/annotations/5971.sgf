AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Dear reviewer. My name is Biondy and this is my game in IGS.
Handicap gae and I still lost 3.5 moku. My opponent also had reviewed this game by some var. I'll add it.

Please your help

[Agi\]
Hello, I'm Agilis of KGS, and I'll be reviewing your game. I'll place a tag near my comments to separate them preexisting ones.

Because this is a 9H game, and white could easily give me 9 stones, I'm sure I don't understand a number of things white is thinking, so I'll refrain from commenting too much about white.]

(;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pm];B[nq]C[ok. I don't really know what move should be played here.

[Agi\] There's nothing particularly bad about this move.];W[nj]
;B[ok]C[[Agi\]
Good, coming out, splitting white, and keeping white weak is important.]

(;B[jf]C[not very sure w/ this move. What do you think?

[Agi\] This move is fine from a framework-building perspective. However, white is weak in a number of places, and could be exploited. See variations.

The point is, you can't expect to win just by defending, you already have a huge advantage at the start, and should be using that position to make white live small, and profit accordingly.]
;W[jc];B[ic];W[kd];B[ke]LB[id:A]TR[nj]SQ[pf][qf]C[Bad move create weakness at A, but I don't want w to go to centre

[Agi\]
Corners, sides, then center. 
Converting influence to territory involves attacking, so you shouldn't let white settle groups quickly if possible.]
;W[id];B[je];W[ib];B[hc];W[hb];B[gc];W[kc];B[le]LB[nb:B][mc:A]
C[My opponent said that it's better to play at A or B

[Agi\]
Yes, A or B would do 2 things,
1) it would defend the top right corner from invasions.
2) it threatens to limit the base of the top group. again, weak white groups == profitable chasing.]
;W[gb];B[fc];W[nb]C[[Agi\] And white now settles, and takes away the entire top and most of the corner.]
;B[mb];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[oc]
(;B[rc]C[[Agi\] Settling like this is costly. See variation]
;W[od];B[re];W[qa];B[rb];W[pe];B[qd]C[[Agi\] Here, black barely lives in the corner,]
;W[mc]C[[Agi\], and with this move, white makes a strong connected group on the top.]

(;B[hq];W[rq];B[rp];W[qo];B[rr];W[ml]C[[Agi\] Now that white is strong on top, the right black group is weak enough to attack]
;B[om];W[nm];B[pl];W[on];B[qm];W[ol];B[qh];W[ql];B[pk];W[rm]
;B[qk];W[rl];B[rk]TR[nj][ml][ol][nm]C[[Agi\] the price that black paid here for life, is a live white group facing the center. This makes profiing in the center difficult.]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[kp];B[kq];W[lq]
(;B[lp]C[[Agi\] here black accept's white's offer to trade. However, white gets more out of the deal. See variation.]
;W[ko];B[lr];W[jq];B[kr]C[is there any better way to prevent white attack here?

[Agi\] Once you take the trade, this is more or less inevitable]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[ep];B[do];W[ip];B[jo];W[iq];B[jn]TR[nm][ko]C[[Agi\] Sadly, this move doesn't split white in a useful way. Thanks to the strong white group on the right.]

[Agi\]
The highlight of this game was that black gave white most of what she wanted without a fight. Only during endgame did black try to make more agressive moves, but by then white's stronger reading made profiting difficult.

With 9 handicap stones, the aggressive one should be black, the one who should be scared of the board is white.

In a game with only 2 opposing players, letting your opponent have everything go their way, is usually a bad idea.

Stick to the basics, stay connected if your groups aren't alive yet, keep white separated whenever possible, and think twice about what you really want before taking what white offers.]

(;B[jq]LB[iq:B][qq:A]C[[Agi\] Group A is alive, and doesn't look like it will die if white moves nearby. Group B however, has a white group on the left. it would be better to defend it and make it stronger.]

(;B[od]C[[Agi\] The corner is about lost, but you should keep your stones connected.]

(;W[rb];B[mc]LB[fb:A][re:C][oh:B]C[[Agi\] At this point, black has 2 places to aim at.
point A would make the top group practically dead. It would take more reading to figure it out, but if it were true. N17 feels like sente.

Point B is the other big point. it really starts building the center. White has trouble connecting with C, see hypothetical variation]

Let's just assume white goes here.];B[oh]TR[nd][qe][jf][eg]
