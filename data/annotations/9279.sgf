C[Firstly, you're playing a *much* stronger opponent. I can tell you ways to improve your moves but my experience is that you learn more by playing opponents who are 1-5 levels above you, not 12. He will play moves that are very forward looking and are difficult to explain if you don't have the intuition of a player nearer his level.]

;B[od];W[nb];B[me];W[nq];B[lp];W[no];B[pn];W[pr]TR[qq]C[I think R3 is very important to stop white from settling.]

(;B[mq]C[There are much bigger moves. You're attacking a group that is already unsettled. By attaching, you are stabilising white's weak group. Tenuki to D10 or R3 is more forward looking I think.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[or]C[I would focus on cutting his groups.]
(;B[np];W[nr];B[mn]C[What is the point of this move? O5 is extremely light, there is nothing to gain in attacking it. R3 is peeking up your open skirt, as you promptly see ;)

Remember: important moves before big moves.];W[ro];B[rn];W[qo]

;B[mp];W[mm]C[White is coming out, this is not an attack you can stop, play any of the big moves instead of saving N6. If white takes N6 within the next 30 moves he wastes a huge move.]
;B[ln];W[kl]SQ[cf][dj][cn][ep]C[He's trying to survive. You should benefit while chasing: playing at the squares are ways to benefit greatly. He will have to achieve two goals with every response he makes: guard against your invasion, while keeping escape routes open for his unsettled white group.]
;B[gp]C[This is a bit small - you have a huge wall to the right, so you want to encourage him to play in that framework so you can chase and and profit, or even kill. This places comparitively little pressure on his corner stone.]
;W[dn];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[cr];B[ep]C[This is not very good. I'm not even sure it is sente. It is called aji-keshi http://senseis.xmp.net/?AjiKeshi]
;W[do]C[You played a move that forced your opponent to respond with a good move.]

(;B[mr]C[I think that was my first mistake 10C would be better in the future. 

I agree, that would be much bigger. "Your opponents best move is your best move."]
;W[cj];B[io]C[Very little pressure is applied to your opponent here. It secures territory that is already certain.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[Very little pressure on your opponent.];W[ff]

(;B[li]C[This is good, I would play on N10 for symmetry reasons, skew connections end up costing a lot of moves when you eventually patch the diagonal jump. It also has a severe cut as you soon saw : /]
;W[ni]C[I would say you *have* cut at O10 now. He has jumped far into your territory and if he tries to save his stone you can cut at M7 while attacking and end up killing a lot.]

C[This game is going very badly for black I'm afraid. I cannot see how you can win from here: you could try and play deep and connect out perhaps:]
