AB[dd][dj][dp][jd][jp][pd][pj][pp]C[Dear reviewer. I played this against a 1dan and ended up winning narrowly. I have a couple tsuji questions which I would appreciate your advise on. Critique me harshly. Thanks in advance.

-Kyle

I am Tuomas, 6 kyu from Finland. Agressive and intuitive player who don't much care about playing by the book. It seems that you are not afraid of words. Good, then I can use them freely. Please bear with my hopefully sharp criticue.

The first mistake you make is apparent from your comment above. You should not try to use tesuji. Never. The reason is that, face it, you as 20 kuy do not understand the basics of the game. If you try to trick with tesuji, you only trick yourself. Learn the basics first, and learn them good. And then, one day, other people will call basic move tesuji.
.];W[fc];B[ec]C[OYAOYA: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.]
;W[fd];B[df];W[nc];B[lc]C[This black shape is not efficient. Black K16 is already a pincer and this is another pincer.  Black side does not become much stronger after this, and black corner is left open. This black is also a bad shape in this situation, I think.

One strategy for handicap games is playing time. Not clock time but stone time. Try not to commit on anything and keep things simple and clean. Black K14 is such move. M17 commits black to the side and black becomes heavy.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[le];B[md]C[Go is not a simple game. Nothing is as simple as it looks like and straightforward attack like this will usually end up badly.  Here white is using strong basic shape, while black has formation with well known weaknesses.

Rule of thumb: attacking somethign makes it strong. To kill something, don't attack before you can kill it.]
;W[nd];B[me];W[mf];B[lf];W[of];B[pg];W[kf];B[lg];W[ke];B[hc]
C[Unless black defend, white can connect his two weak groups to single living group. This move puts presure to right white group, but it has no effect on center. Black is weak, he needs to defend before attacking.]
;W[kc]C[Some people would call this tesuji that kills two black stones. I think this is basic move. Or perhaps tesuji are actually basic moves.  I don't know, I am just 6 kyu after all.]
;B[jc];W[kd];B[hf]C[Failure to build basic tabletob shape. H15 instead of this would complete the tabletop. 

Reasoning behind tabletop is following. The bamboo joint, black H16 in this situation, is ultimate connection between K17-H17 groups. But it is heavy and slow. To make it lighter and faster there is tabletop. It has some weaknesses that bamboo does not have, but in many cases it is a lot better. Then this H14, well it might be ok, but I would not call this basic move. Take it easy and make the tabletop.

If you do not know basic stones then find and read excellent ``Shape up创 by C. Mathews. It is available online in gobase. I really have to read it soon.

Back to board. What is the situation now? White has three groups, but two can connect and are fairly safe.  This connected group can also support further operations in center and top-right corner. The third white group is in fairly bad condition, but perhaps that black uncommon shape has nice weaknesses that can help.]
;W[mg];B[kg];W[ff]C[White simply pushes out using the weak black group to get more time.]
;B[ge]C[By the way, think situation where black has tabletop here (so move stone from H14 to H15). What happens if black goes straight to F15 instead of this. Does it work? It is a mess of course and I think white can get too good result from it, but thik it through anyway.]
;W[fe];B[gh];W[gg];B[gf]C[The most fundamenta bad move is one that makes so called ``empty triangle创. In Finland one of the strongest players claims that he has patented it and tells people to pay for him every time they make empty triangle. This is perhaps the most wastefull shape in go. Only ``power square创 is worse (it is formed when you fill empty triangle, H15 here). H13 would be a lot better because it prevents white from connecting this group to the strong group.

In one of my funniest games ever I was playing even game with a bit weaker opponent. I managed to force him to play one ``power square创 after another. After every one he was so busy defending it that he had to play new one somewhere else. In end he resigned with 15 or 16 power squares on board. You can imagine what it looked like.]
;W[eg]C[White plays basic move to connect and put presure on left side.]
;B[dg];W[hg]C[The weak white groups is slowly becomming a killer. Black topside is crumbling.]
;B[fh];W[if]C[Disaster for black, he has to go all out defence just to keep the upper side alive.]
;B[gc]C[Good basic move that prevents some nice white tesuji.]
;W[gd];B[fb];W[fg]C[White has single connected group now, by the way.]
;B[eh];W[hh];B[kb];W[mc];B[gj]C[Black took heavy beating up there, but this wall is nice. White will have difficult times to destroy this framework.]
;W[nq];B[qn]C[Good, here you do not want to touch the white O3 because it would allow white to build strength towards left side.]
;W[fq];B[fp];W[gp];B[eq]C[Bad choice of joseki. Think where the territory is! This variation is corner oriented and it allow white to build influence towards center. This influence will ruin your wall at line 12. F5 would be sweet here.]
;W[fo];B[ep];W[go];B[gq];W[hq];B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[ip]C[And now again, black stone is starting to be weak. Black has to pull it out. Too good result for white. Not only the wall, but also handicap stone at K4 is wasted.]
;B[jq];W[pq];B[qq];W[qr];B[pr];W[oq];B[rr]C[Take it easy and keep it simple. Again here you offer a trade where you get the corner while white takes center influence. Just what he want. He has strong shape on botton side that will work well with this stength. And he also makes black right side smaller.

In handicap games white usually wants more influence and the last thing he wants to do is live small in corners. So let him take corners and build walls. 

Play R4 instead.];W[qp];B[rq];W[or];B[qs];W[po]C[Here the bottom side is under white influence. Also Black right side has become much more vulnerable. If black had given white some more points in corner he could have taken right side easier.]
;B[pn];W[op];B[mp]C[I would take O6 and then try to figure out something clever for two stones at column K.]
;W[on];B[no]C[After white got P6 you have to play something like this.

One plan: just om with N6 or K6 instead. Then you split the white groups and after white defends one, you attack the other. But killing this big groups is almost impossible so you need to attack so that you can make territory.]
;W[mq];B[oo];W[lp];B[lo];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[ln];B[lq]
;W[mo];B[om]C[This is fairly large,but the other side would be better. That white group at lefthand side bottom is not alive, in fact it does not have single eye. Wall at line 12 is in perfect position for attacking it. Only weakness is the black center botton group that is weak.

First step would be either preventing white to enter left side with E6 or D6. After that white would try to push towards tengen which would be dangerous for black. Another alternative for black would be to attack from center with H6 for example. It defends the weak black groups and forces white to live in left side. White really has to respond that attack. 

If that attack fails, then black should try to get sente to play this P7 first.]
;W[dn];B[nn];W[np];B[ki];W[dl]C[Now black has allowed white to build base without distraction.]

(;B[do];W[fl];B[gm];W[fm];B[el];W[ek];B[gn];W[fn];B[gl]C[I'd like to think e8 got me this wall (not worth much though).

What does this wall do? It is frankly fairly useless. Wall need open space on one side to be effective. This late in game walls are worthless.]

;W[pi]C[Allowing white to penetrate your defence like this is a bad mistake. Territory decides the game.]

White challenges black but black redraws. I would connect at D15 and fight for it. Try the connection and then think if you can get the white alive. I think this white stone is bluff.]

But what to do differently: pay more attention to the whole board and try to get above of just fingting the fight. I got a sence that you concentrate too much to local situation and lose in big scale. Examples were the botton left white group that is barely alive, even though you allowed him to make two extra moves inside your framework. Another is the way you gave out the right side to white to defend the center group that has now more than enough eyes.]
