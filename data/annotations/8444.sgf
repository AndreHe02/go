C[I lost this game by losing a big corner in the lower right.  I lost that corner trying to save a weak group in the center.  I put comments on moves I thought were questionable.  Thanks for reviewing the game!]
;B[qd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dc];B[ce];W[dh];B[cl]C[I felt like it was a mistake for black to leave that black stone, but looking back I didn't really gain too much, maybe black's move was OK.

CG: I don't think that was a "mistake" - tenuki is always an option. You'll find professional games where black plays tenuki after the two space high pincer.]
;W[de]C[Maybe C16 instead?

CG: No, I think D15 is ok. C16 isolates D12.];B[df]
(;W[cd]C[Is E15 better?

CG: Yes, you should try to keep your stones connected.];B[ee]
;W[dd];B[ef];W[od];B[pe]C[Never seen this move before

CG: Yes, this is a strange move.];W[cf]C[I was trying to keep the 3 stones weak, but I didn't succeed really

CG: That's a bit optimistic - D12 is much weaker than the three stones. It's also strange to play tenuki after blacks diagonal play.]
;B[cg];W[be];B[dg];W[bg]LB[ch:A][eh:B]C[Sente, but maybe helps black more than white

CG: Black might also judge that he can answer A with B and switch to the top right which is very big.
I like the definition of sente as "a position where I wish my opponent does not answer".]
;B[ch]
(;W[oe]C[CG: I found the variation with R17 in professional games, but it depends on a ladder.]
;B[qh];W[kd]C[CG: Now I would attach at R17 before playing the extension.]
;B[nq];W[qn];B[jp];W[fq]
(;B[hq]C[CG: This is a mistake in direction.];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]
;B[co]C[overplay?

CG: Yes!!];W[cr]C[CG: Good, you know the right answer.];B[dr]
;W[do]C[I think black messed up some here];B[eo];W[dn];B[fp]
;W[cn];B[em]
(;W[lp]LB[kp:B][mp:C][lq:A]C[I think maybe just a play around G16 is bigger

CG: This is a bad move locally. The correct invasion points are A, B, or C. I myself would still play R17.]
(;B[no]C[CG: Bad answer.];W[ln];B[nm];W[oq];B[mq];W[ll];B[pl]
;W[gd]C[CG: No! You should not play tenuki while having such a weak group.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qm];W[rn];B[ic]C[I think my response to this ultimately lost me the game.  I got too excited about capturing the black stones and let my own weak group get completely cut off.  I'm not sure who's ahead before this, but it seems fairly even.

CG: That's the problem: You cannot fight hard while you have a weak group - therefore G16 is not as big as it looks. Settle your group first.]
(;W[jc]C[J16 better?  this was my only big territory, I wanted to preserve as much as possible.  I thought I could make J17 heavy

CG: K17 is ok, but you can't expect to capture black.];B[id]
;W[he]C[CG: Overplay - You should play L14 instead.];B[ie];W[hf]
;B[mc]C[good move from black];W[md];B[fc]
(;W[fd]C[CG: Bad answer from white. You should connect by playing G17.]
;B[ed];W[gc];B[ec];W[if]C[CG: Now you are separated.];B[ke]
(;W[le]C[CG: N17 still has lot of aji with the sente moves M17 and O17.]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[kg]
(;W[jd]C[CG: Bad style (aji-keshi). Maybe at some point you need the sente variation. Black won't play K16, so you can wait if you need this peep.]
;B[je];W[jh];B[lc];W[ld];B[kh]
(;W[lf]LB[ib:A]C[Maybe I needed to try harder to connect my center stones

CG: This is what happens if you carelessly play "sente" moves. Even if you cut, black can play A threatening to connect to either left or right. 
You should just extend to K11.];B[ji];W[kf]C[Seems like I wasn't being cautious enough here.  I made big profit on the top, but my stones in the center are in trouble now]
;B[ii];W[ig]C[CG: H12 is correct shape.];B[mi];W[kj]C[Now I have to struggle to live

CG: ... which is already difficult.];B[ik];W[ki];B[mg];W[jo]
