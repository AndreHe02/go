TM[2700]RE[B+2.5]US[Brought to you by IGS]KM[5.5];W[fq];B[jp];W[cq]C[In a high handicap game, white needs to tenuki frequently in the opening.  Your first

move at F3 is fine, but now you should abandon it.  C3 will lead into a rapid settlement
of this corner, which is something you do not want.];B[fp];W[dq];B[dm];W
[fc];B[jd];W[fe];B[he];W[df]C[Still too focused.  You need to get some stones all around the board, where they may
help you in the fighting to come.];B[dh];W[cf]C[Heavy.  You should be playing very lightly now.]
;B[gh];W[nc];B[nd];W[lc];B[ld];W[jc]M[jc][lc][nc]C[The marked stones are extremely weak, because of all of the potential cutting
points.  Avoid contact moves like this until you are prepared for a fight.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[kc];W[hc];B[id];W[qc];B[pg];W[pc];B[od];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]
;B[op];W[oq];B[pm];W[mq]C[Though this secures more territory on the bottom, you need to get into that large

black moyo in the middle.  Aim to separate the black stones as much as possible.]
;B[mp];W[jq]C[Attaching under like this is not a good strategy in this situation, as it will just

strengthen black.  The attachment might be good if you were invading black's side
territory, but that's not the case here.];B[jm]C[
 jim 9k :  W should not contact underneath B so much.];W[ke]C[A peep like this is one nice way to get into your opponent's moyo.  However, the peep

must represent a real threat.  In this case, it does not.  Even if you push in at L16,
black can capture at K18.];B[kd];W[kg]L[mj]C[This is too tight.  Perhaps a move around `a' would be better.  Leave as many options
open as possible, rather than aiming towards a single goal.];B[me];W[ms]
C[phh: This was a typo. The move
should have been N14 (the "4" key
on my PC is bad).  Fortunately
black didn't take advantage of this.];B[kq];W[kr];B[lq];W[lr];B[ko];W[mf]
C[This is good shape, but it's still heavy, and this close to black's strong wall, you

can't really hope for all of your stones to survive.  Play light and sacrifice to
make good shape and keep some stones alive.];B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[mh];B[mj]
;W[li];B[lj];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[ih];W[jf];B[ig]L[le]C[Black should probably have played `a' instead.  I think that move kills.]
;W[le];B[ki];W[kh];B[mi];W[kj];B[kk];W[ki];B[lg];W[lf];B[nh];W[co]C[Though this will lead to more territory on the edge, you will strengthen black's
central moyo so much that an invasion becomes impossible later.];B[do];W
[cm]L[cn]M[cm][co][cq]C[There are too many cutting points between the marked stones.  Perhaps `a' is  better.]
;B[cn];W[bn];B[dn];W[cp];B[cl];W[ch]L[dl]M[cm]C[Saving the marked stone may be worthwhile.  It's worth about 5 points in gote, but it
may lead to the possibility of a cut at `a' too.];B[ci];W[cg]L[bh]C[Bad shape.  Consider `a' instead.]
;B[eg];W[ef];B[fg];W[cc]C[Good!  That's a big corner.];B[fd];W[gd];B[ge]

;W[qj];B[qk];W[qi];B[pi];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rm];W[sj]L[re]C[I don't think this move is necessary.  A better defensive move is to maintain
an unbreakable connection with the corner by filling at `a.'];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[nb];W[pb];B[mc];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip];B[io];W[ik]L[ij][jk]C[A proverb says `never peep where you can cut.'  You can cut at either `a' or `b.'

I don't see anything coming of the cuts just now, but the peep will strengthen  black.]
