myopian [4k\]: m

T: Hi, as well. No guarantees for the reading in this review, you should check everything twice.

M: yours is one of the finest reviews i've ever received; very instructive, thank you.  i have since edited in a few follow-up questions in places where i am still puzzled, if you would be so kind as to put me straight on them.

T: I added some more comments and sequences (which in part I only saw now).]

(;B[cd];W[po];B[qm]C[reasonable?

T: Don't know.];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[qj]C[b feels happy

T: Why? I assume, and it is a pattern later in top left as well, for playing on both sides. This isn't always the best way. Effectively you sacrificed a corner for R7-R10.]
;W[or]
(;B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[op]TR[np][nq]C[T: White has 6 stones in the corner against Black 4, now is White better here than with net 2 stones in other configuration? You feel happy about this if because you count marked black stones as influence, not as liability.]

(;B[re]C[a 5d i used to know often played this move; is it good here?

T: Seems reasonable enough, especially since there is already a black stone at R10.]
;W[pc]
(;B[lc]C[T: Too ambitious. White has two strong groups and one weak stone, instead of doing something about White's weakness you play an unconnected stone next to his strong group.]
;W[qh];B[oi];W[oh];B[me]TR[lc]C[T: In my preferred version this stone would already be here, M17 doesn't help the fighting that much and you would surely like to place it elsewhere now. Compare diagram.

M: i would like to explore this a bit more; going back to your preferred move 20...]

;W[og];B[pf];W[ph];B[nd];W[oc];B[mc];W[nf];B[ne];W[kp]C[T: Previous exchanges left White groups strong, which isn't good for Black in a handicap game, now don't offer to weaken yourself.]

(;B[nn]LB[nm:A][om:C][pm:D][on:B]C[T: Ouch. One group will be hurt.

M:  i dont understand why "ouch"; in my eyes, this move helps b on the right and makes w play more moves if he wants O3,4 which i'd be happy to sacrifice to get thickness facing left in return.  but am i missing something?  if you were w, where would you play now?

T: You made a small gap and drive White through it. While it is at times necessary to add a stone before sacrifice, I doubt this was your idea when playing O6. Even a single line makes a lot of difference here, it would probably work out differently had you played on A, B or C. As White I would consider C or D (or even A to make you cut like in the game) locally.]
;W[om]C[T: Don't force White to weaken two of your groups at once. You would do better if you consider O4 as dead weight / bait for sacrifice. 

M: this looks like a typical w overplay to me; if you were b, how would you handle it?

T: Looks perfectly reasonable to me. White is already alive in the corner and will be able to handle cutting stones, while Black is busy on both sides.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[pm];W[nm]
(;B[mk]C[T: If you fear about this group, you better not play O6 etc. Result gets worse with each move.

M:  even after your comment, which makes me doubt myself, i still like the look of this.  yes, w will go after 4 more b stones, but who cares?  4 stones is only 8 points.  but again, am i missing something important?  something strategic?

T: You write now as if you plan to sacrifice, but only in retrospective, in the game you play with a visible intention to 1) go after P7 (cutting stone) and 2) save O4 stones. Even after 1) is gone, you pursue 2). The problem is the consistency, you play out moves for a certain purpose only to abandon that purpose a few moves later. Compare this to the situation, if you had played N9 without cutting first.]

(;W[mn];B[lo];W[no];B[mo]C[T: This move doesn't work.

M;  yes, typical short-sighted me :(  it hadnt been my plan, but i thought i saw something for nothing... wrong again! :)]

(;B[ko];W[jo];B[mp];W[ip]C[T: While Black is busy making a heavy group White builds strength towards the area where it matters.

M: yes, b lost the plot a few moves back];B[jq]C[another overcook...aji keshi... sigh

(;B[fr];W[ep];B[gq];W[fp]
(;B[dq]C[T: Why G3 if you intend to play D3 instead of D2 now?

M:  G3 wasnt played with any deep thought; i am a lazy thinker and often toss in a stone for opp to seize upon whilst i calmly make more territory on the other side.  here, i felt the corner was bigger and dint like the thought of w entering at 3-3.  was i right to be concerned about this?]
;W[gr];B[mm]C[aji keshi?

T: There is no aji for you in this area. White is already alive.

M:  i just meant i think it was a waste of a ko threat and an unnecessary loss of sente.  i think i played it out of lack of confidence after stuffing up on the lower side, making a hevy group that was starting to get too big to lose

T: You don't lose sente. (You are too self-degrading in your newer comments, no reason for that.) But yes, I know the feeling.]
;W[oo];B[cn];W[ki]
(;B[kl]C[T: You realise there is no white stone at O6, i.e. there is no cut threatened?

M: i do now!  but at the time i guess i was still feeling a loss of confidence]
;W[ed];B[df];W[cc];B[fc]C[T: ?

M: ok, here is where i might learn something important from you.  i guess you are going to tell me it loses the corner, but is that really so important?  of course, i plyed this hoping to get a lot on the upper side, but again, am i missing something?

T: Again it is more about consistency. Why D14 first, if you care about the top?]
;W[fd];B[hc];W[ec];B[bc];W[gc]
(;B[cj]C[b feels like he has already won.  is that feeling justified?

T: No. You later lost by over 30 points. 

Long form: You have a sizeable framework on the left side, but only the bottom left corner is countable territory at this point. + It is a handicap game of 250+ moves, even being ahead at move 100 isn't enough. Ask yourself, how much of your starting advantage have you retained / lost so far, by this measure White can play fairly confident as she certainly gained more than 40% of the handicap from you .

M: interesting.  of course, b doesnt expect to get the whole left, but i imagine he would have, lets say, at least 30 points more than w there.

w has a couple of corners, but there is aji on the upper right side and if b gets to play O2 later, the lower side wont be that big.  can you elaborate a bit on why you dont see b having a big lead here please? - stop press: i see that you do, later on.  it was quite an eye-opener for me; clearly my eyteball guestimates of territory are woefully unreliable.

T: At B82 you wanted to gain on the top, now you completely abandon it, although you have the opportunity to play H16 now. (Flexibility is great, but with some of your sudden changes of direction / plan you incur losses, because your  stones work at cross-purposes.) + You got what you wanted on the left side in the end, but this is simply not enough if White makes territory and captures stones everywhere else. Arguably end game mistakes contributed a lot to the end result, but that is part of the reason for writing that being ahead at move 100 isn't enough to be complacent in a handicap game.]
;W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[jc];W[hb]
(;B[qg];W[jd]
(;B[je]C[T: What is this supposed to do?

M:  a rhetorical question, i guess, but i was (and still am!) thinking it could be useful to pressure the w group on the right in the hope of soldifying my moyo on the left

T: Not rhetorical, I don't understand this at all. A simple move guarding the eyespace of your group puts more pressure on the white group on the right.]

(;W[ie];B[kd];W[jf];B[ke];W[jb];B[ej];W[kc]C[T: White plays unnecessarily slow here.]

(;B[cb];W[er]C[T: E2 as Black would probably end in sente in the game, as it threatens to bring G3 back to life and erase white territory and eyespace.]
;B[dr];W[fs];B[en]C[T: Black now spending moves to "defend", what he probably already counted as territory earlier, losing elsewhere in the meantime. White is comfortable everywhere, expecting endgame profit.

M:  hmm - i am obviously not seeing w can still get in

T: I don't either, but count how many points you made on the left side at the end of the game, compare with your earlier estimates and look at all the moves you additionally played after that estimate to make it that large and what White got in the meantime.]
;W[ds];B[mr]LB[cr:A]C[T: Is this really larger than the corner?

M:  the top left corner i guess you mean.  i thought i already had it!  or do you mean reducing the bottom right instead?

[rr][sr][as][bs][cs][es][gs][hs][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[T: A bit of estimation. Looks like White 43+8 is already ahead compared to Black 45.

M: that's very instructive.  even looking at it now, unless i painfully count all the points you marked, one by one, it still looks to my myopic eyes that b is way ahead!  and of course, as you demonstrate, he's already behind !!

4 little bits are bigger than one big bit... i guess i am blinded by having had too easy a time of it on the left, and by often winning games by a huge margin because my opp completely neglects a whole are of the board, so hell-bent are they on killing one group or another.

but in this case, i dont end up succeeding, and even in retrospect it's not immediately apparent to me why, even though i can see your count.  it still feels like i must have made a silly slip later on... 

i obviously have a blind spot, but the trouble is, being blind, i cannot see what my blind spot is, even when you point out the big picture so clearly.

help!

as i cant remember what ensued, and havent followed the further plays yet, it looks to me like b has a chance of further expanding his moyo as well as reducing w's bottom right corner.

what am i missing??  presumably invasion weaknesses...

T: There is no alternative to counting. (It is easy to miss the lopsidedness of captures (8+4 vs. 1) if you only "inspect" area sizes visually without counting.) There is no invasion in any of this counting only endgame assumptions (which may be off here and there) and middling out of border areas (no points for either side where playing is gote for both). 

T: Personally, I count in pairs 2-4-6-8-10-... to speed up the procedure.]
;W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[ms];W[kq]LB[if:A][ng:B][ih:D][lh:E][gm:C]
C[T: White has only one apparent weakness. B isn't yet finally alive (unlike the other groups), and although it won't be killed maybe there is a way to bring its relative weakness profitably into play, otherwise you have to beat your opponent in the endgame.

M: i hear what you say... yet i still cant see it.  to me b looks safe on the right; and w's last move looks like a weak yose move even though the middle game hasnt quite finished.  oh dear, i am really confused.

T: The white B group has one definite eye and more potential. IF you find a way to threaten it while building the center it may work and turn out better than your move at C, e.g. sth. like D (looking at both A and around E). You may even get the possibility to come back to C. But then, maybe simple endgame moves are even better.]
;B[gm]LB[dc:A][rc:C][ro:B]TR[kl][dm]SQ[ki][fo]C[T: Not really clear to me, whether this is a focal point enlarging your area while reducing opponent, or just slow. It is easy to overestimate this kind of move during the endgame. Compare with A, B, C for territorial moves.

M: hmm, maybe you are finding my blind spot... i thoght this was a fast move, enlarging the moyo and reducing w's potential enlargement toward the centre.  i see it as what Bruce Wilcox calls a "sector line" move, crossing w's sector line between the square stones and strengthening the relationship between b's triangle ones.  but am i misunderstanding what he means?

T: I only know about Wilcox second hand. I thought he is mainly talking heuristics for opening / midgame. Either way, the game is much closer than the result at the end suggests = you lost a considerable amount of points due to  endgame mistakes, that should be easy to correct (missed sente, scared unnecessary moves).]
