C[Hi, 

My name is Mike, I'm around 8k on KGS and I'll be your reviewer for this game. I will focus on black's position, and try to answer any questions you had, as well as make suggestions of my own.

As a disclaimer, take my words with a grain of salt, for I am but a beginner. But I hope I show you what potential your stones have, as well as where you might have made some of your biggest errors, and how to improve upon them.]

(;B[qq]TR[cj][cn][fq][nq]C[This move is considered an invasion (called the 3-3 point invasion, or san-san, from the japanese word for 3). At this point in the game it is a bit too early for an invasion, so you might try a corner approach instead. Although this cannot be a terrible move, it is probably not ideal. Consider the triangled moves as large points.]

(;B[gr]C[Also, this move seems a bit unecessary. If you were worried about this group dying, try working on life and death problems at goproblems.com or buying a book. This group should live, as it has ample eyespace. Notice that if you were not worried about the life of this group, this move actually takes away a point of territory from you, as well as wasting a move that could be spent elswhere (huge defensive move like C17, etc)]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[go]
(;B[hi]C[I tried to analyze whether white's cut at G12 was dire or not. And it seems that white can probably do some damage with it, so this is a good defensive move. The variations are other possibilities that you might consider.]
;W[pc]C[This is a large area, but its hard for me to say which is more vital at this point, H11 or here.]
;B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qc];B[bk];W[fk];B[fj];W[qa]
(;B[kh]C[This move is quite unecessary compared to a defensive move at C17. think of the diferences (lecture coming in a few moves.)]
;W[ki];B[hk];W[ik];B[gk];W[gl];B[ij];W[jj]C[This is a very important lesson in go, and if you remember one thing from my review I hope that this is what you remember. Think about what happens if white captures K10. 

1. Does it greatly affect the life and death of surrounding groups?   Not really, G10 is very safe.

2. Does saving K10 put much pressure on any of white's stones? Not that I see. Perhaps a cut at K9 becomes a bit more attractive, but nothing extroardinary.

So after realizing that saving K10 doesn't have much affect on large groups or large territory, lets think about how much it is worth to save it. about 1 point of territory + a bit of potential at K9.

Now lets think about how much a defensive move at say C17 is worth. (look at the variation)

It is vital that you learn to spot moves that are tiny in the scheme of things (worth around 2-5 points when moves at C17 could be worth 20 or 30)]

(;B[hj]C[this move is TINY =(]
(;W[jl]
(;B[nj]C[This move is not a bad idea, but it is not worth as much as say C17. You should defend this spot now!]
;W[cc]C[And see, now white notices how big this move is.

Its important to notice that as it stands, this invasion is going to be a success. So now your job is to pressure white into living small, and make a big wall for yourself. The joseki goes as follows]

(;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb]C[Nuro [17k\]: e17 for w better?

M: this is following the joseki so far, but your next move deviates from the joseki, and is the culprit of the poor result you mentioned.]

(;B[gb]C[Nuro [17k\]: instead of d17];W[ed]
(;B[fd]C[Also, you should at least fight white. try extending from E17.letting white capture E17 is actually HUGE. follow the variations and see that allowing this stone to be captured is much different than allowing J10 to be captured. The main difference is:

1. Does it affect the life/death of groups in the area?

YES! saving E17 puts a great deal of pressure on C17/D17 and will allow black to make a wall in sente. Furthermore, it means the likely death of E16 (look at the variations, play some out, think about what white can do).

So one thing you need to learn is which stones are junk stones (not worth very much, dont affect large groups or large territory, for example J10) and which stones are key stones, (stones that mean life and death for certain groups, stones like E17 here).]
;W[fc];B[ee];W[ec];B[fe]C[See now you have to protect this cut, white seems strong in the area, and he really should not be, he's invading. This is mainly due to the mistake at E17, not at G18 (G18 might not even be a mistake, just a deviation from the joseki)]
;W[gc]C[and now white pierces right into black's precious territory. This is very unfortunate, as the top was black's main area of control.]
;B[gd]C[Just to show how big saving E17 was, compare the difference between this position and the one in the variations.]

;W[af]
(;B[ae]TR[ad][be]C[Also, this is a minor tactical mistake that ended up having a large point-value since it let whites b14/a14 group live, whereas it probably would have died. notice how this makes bad shape (empty triangle, highlighted) and it leaves black's stones with only 2 liberties! you've got to be very careful when making moves on the edge, and next to enemy stones, as they leave you surprisingly short of liberties.

Just take your time and read out the situation. perhaps you were pressured on time here. If not, make sure you're reading out your enemy's next moves, it should be pretty obvious here that white will play C15, and i'm sure you can read out that sequence. In general though be quite cautious on the first line, and ESPECIALLY cautious in corners. crazy things happen in the corners.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[bd]C[ouch =(];B[cf];W[be];B[df]C[Key points:

1. Look at my comments of J10/E17. Learn to recognize which stones you should save and which stones you should let go.

2. be careful on the first line! you're already one liberty short when you play there. Tactical errors were not such a great part of this game, and your reading ability will improve with practice.

3. Dont get caught up in local battles when there are much larger points on the board (this relates to J10/L12 and is the lesson i hope you take from this game.)

4. As a final note, if you're goint to sacrifice stones (which is okay, provided they're not vital/key stones like E17) use their aji (aka potential) to wreak havoc. I'll provide some examples here as variations to show my point. (look at C4 and P4).

I hope you enjoyed my review as much as I enjoyed reviewing your game. Good luck in the future, and remember to always ask yourself whether a move is tiny or not. And dont make empty triangles.

my name is Mike on KGS, although i'm not on very often.]
