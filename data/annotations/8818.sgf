C[Hi there!

This is a game between myself (17k) and a 18k? opponent on KGS. I'm White, and it's 25mins each timed.

I found this game very difficult. There was lots of aji everywhere, and fighting at every turn. I'd like to cultivate a calmer playstyle and learn to take the big points and create frameworks properly.

>> Hi, I am about 4-5 k player from Germany. I hoep I can make some helpful comments ;-)]

;B[dp];W[dc];B[de];W[fd]C[If you can't tell, I don't know Joseki well, so I took my best guesses when it came to corner fights

>> this is a posible joseki move and is ok here. Possible joseki continuation ...]
(;B[ed]C[>> well, this is not joseki. Reason is: the 2 white stones are close togther but not tightly linked. Now white links up his stones early, leaving black less opportunities for later.

For joseki study: check www.eidogo.com];W[ec]C[>> right move]
;B[bd]C[>> now it should be clear: the exchnge E16 against E17 was in white's favour. Without the exchange, black could have played C17.]
;W[cc]C[>> a little slow. As there is no danger for the white group, bigger points should be played (R6, K3, G3, ...)]
;B[bc]C[>> white C17 was already slow in the beginning. Balck should ignore and play a bigger point (like R14, K3, C11, ...)]
(;W[ee];B[dd];W[ff];B[ge]C[I wasn't happy when I saw this response by black. where should 14 have been to prevent this awkward situation? (F15? G 15?)

>> to prevent this (called kikashi), white should have made a solid link (F15). However, I think the kikashi is much too early. If white covers with F15, black cannot atari at E14.]
;W[fe];B[df]C[>> D14 is gote -> bad];W[fq]C[here I let him start too much of a battle again I think...

;B[ld];W[ke];B[kf];W[lc];B[le];W[kd]C[I honestly thought he'd take that stone instantly, but he ignored it and it went well for him. oops

>> yes, the corner is still important];B[qe];W[nc]C[>> not urgent. White's stones are linked either through O17 or R16 (miai). R15 is no real kikashi. white should play elsewhere]

;W[cn]C[felt ok here, so wanted to take a big point elsewhere (sick of fighting :P)

;B[re]C[>> black likes you so much, she gives you presents ;-)]
;W[rf];B[sf];W[sg];B[rh]C[did I have to prevent the connection here? probably too cautious on my part]

;B[rj];W[qk];B[rk];W[ql]C[>> extremely good for white];B[rl]
;W[qm]C[Here was odd. I mean to hane here when he was at 6 stones, but then he moved away anyway. My follow through on killing this group was... well, non-existant though, and in trying I lost big (see next 40 or so moves)]
;B[qn];W[rm];B[sm];W[ro]C[Had I connected here at S6, probably would have cleaned everything up...

;W[qo];B[pn]C[He surprised me here, and it all went downhill haha]
;W[po]C[>> if you want to keep your stones in the corner, you should not reduce their degrees of freedom in the beginning.]

(;W[rq]C[I actually liked my bamboo joint here, but Realized later that I would still have to kill his group, and he had a whole lotta liberties]
;B[pr];W[ol];B[sl]
(;W[qg];B[qp];W[rp];B[qr];W[no]C[noticed his extra liberties, changed plans. Better to move in on the bottom-left ish side here?

>> yes, or play tenuki and fight on the lower left corner, where you have advantage (2 against 1)]
;B[rr];W[oq];B[pq];W[nq]C[>> too many cutting points.];B[mp]
C[>> black should cut];W[np]C[tried to get influence and failed. Also built near thinkness, better way to play here?

;B[nn];W[ml];B[mn]C[Yup, didn't even notice until too late that he disconnected that bottom l shape... still tried to save it though :(

>> another group lost];W[mr]C[>> fighting for survival is good, but needs a plan. If you cannot win, you should not fight here.]

>> this move was another waste :-(];B[ep];W[en]C[>> strategically wrong. Balck group is not endangered. Balck can now extend on left side. White should be here first.]
;B[dm];W[dn];B[fn];W[ck]C[>> too close. You may play further as there plenty of friends in the center]
;B[dj]C[better to extend down (C8?) or even diagnal at D8?]
