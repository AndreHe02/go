C[Tilwen [1k\]: Hi, I am Tilwen, Black in this game.
Tilwen [1k\]: My opponent managed to win the fight that appeared in the middle and save all his weak groups, I think I missed the opportunities to take the lead.
Tilwen [1k\]: Thanks for helping me finding my mistakes];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de];W[di]C[Tilwen [1k\]: I don't know the D11 pincer and I choode an easy variation. I felt I didn't gain a nice position (what possibilities did I have ?), but it wasn't that terrible I guess.]

(;B[cc]LB[fd:A][gd:B]C[dv: I don't think this is the right direction.]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cg]C[dv: this feels cramped];W[bh]LB[fc:A]
C[dv: White did not defend at the top. I think you can pressure there]
;B[bg];W[ch]C[Tilwen [1k\]: I dedided to take sente, my group is not 100% safe but not in a mortal danger I thought.]
;B[fq]LB[fc:A][dk:B]C[dv: the white groups are not stable, so normally one uses the sente to attack unstable groups, not to explore new areas]
;W[dn];B[jp];W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd]C[dv: White gets the best of both worlds here. You have developed at the wide lower side but White's stones look better placed overall.]
;B[qo]C[Tilwen [1k\]: He attacks and gain some profit, but I felt like the shimari was big enough.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[qh]C[Tilwen [1k\]: And now he pincers directly. My feeling was that this was overplay, but I didn't get such a nice result …


dv: Indeed it has a feeling of overplay but White can afford creating another weak group.]
;B[qk];W[rf]
(;B[qg]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Maybe this a wrong idea ? I thought that getting influence and trying to connect by above was OK …

dv: this is bad technique];W[rg];B[ph];W[pi];B[qi];W[rh]
(;B[ri]C[dv: I think you should be more forceful on the cutting stone. This group will be hard to catch]
;W[oh];B[pg];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc]C[Tilwen [1k\]: My shape is not very beautiful but I have sente and he has weak stones.]
;B[oi]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Maybe this atari is wrong ? I felt like if he tries to rescue Q11 he will need to defend it in gote and I will have time to make my upper group stronger.]
;W[pj];B[ni];W[pk];B[ql];W[pl];B[qm];W[ml]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Should I directly capture the P12 stone ?

dv: give the subsequent events, yes that seems to be a good idea now]
;B[ld];W[qe];B[nd]C[dv: tempting but the shape is bad];W[pe]
C[dv: bad shape now for Black];B[oe];W[of];B[og];W[nf];B[ng]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[mc]C[Tilwen [1k\]: I felt like the result was OK for me here, he now has two weak group, and I feel my upper one is quite OK, so that I will defend O11 while threatening his groups.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Is O18 necessary ? If I play there, he will have M13.]

(;B[lg]C[dv: pushing from behind gains little. You should jump if you want to get ahead]
;W[kf]
(;B[je]SQ[kf][lg]C[Tilwen [1k\]: I'm not sure about my strategy here …

dv: indeed you have created a broken 

You need to choose where to drive White if you can't cut or surround him. See var]
;W[jf];B[ie];W[oc]C[Tilwen [1k\]: This is big, but gote for white ?]
;B[od];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[he]SQ[pg]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Questionnable too … What would you suggest ?

dv: I think this is still ok

White has invested a lot of stones in the endgamish top right, while you have connected all stones, albeit not in a grand way
You have one weak group and White has two

The game is not lost];W[jc]
(;B[ke]C[dv: try to grab sente here];W[jh]C[Tilwen [1k\]: Now it is a very big fight and it ended too bad for me. Can you help me seeing my main mistakes ?
Tilwen [1k\]: Thanks :-)];B[kj]LB[li:A]C[dv: When I saw this jump, I thought it was rather thin but I admit I didn't foresee WHite's later sequence]

;W[mp];B[nq];W[np];B[kn];W[mq];B[kq];W[lk]C[Tilwen [1k\]: I missed the sequence here …

dv: The cut was nicely executed.

End of comments here:

Overall your game looks passive. You do take the initiative but use it to move into undisputed areas rather than pressuring the opponent's weak groups.

At 31-37 some bad technical choices turn the top right into a heavy group
57, which tries to resist, aggravates this and by 58 Black has bad shape

At 83 you should try harder to obtain sente for the battle in the centre.
I'd say this is the pivotal move. Walking on neutral points like this is unacceptable for us. We should try and find a way to get connected with more pressure on the opponent so that we have sente or profit.

After losing the initiative there, Black needs to overstretch]
