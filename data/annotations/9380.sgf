C[Thanks in advance for your review!  I've left comments within.

In general, this is a game where the board divides into roughly 2 halves with large moyo.  I tend to be poor at this type of game, as I don't always pinpoint the best places for invasions and the best routes for defense.  I tend to be better in games with lots of smaller groups.  But I do want to improve at this type of game.  Your thoughts on how to approach these situations would be great.


T : Hi, I'm Tilwen, about 1k/1d KGS, and I'll try my best to make you understand what you did wrong in this game. My comments will start with a T. This kind of game indeed is difficult, having a moyo is nice and reassuring, but the problem is how to make points with. In your game, I think what made you lose tempo was knowing about who was ahead and about your priorities and aims. I'll put my feelings in the file, if you have others questions feel free to ask me :) .]

;B[qf];W[jd];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc]C[I'm more comfortable with this joseki than something like F17 (especially with the W stone at K16).  Would you recommend something else here?


T : I don't see anything wrong with it, it's easy and you will have sente. If you jump with E14, it will become a fight on whole board, it will be an other game.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf];W[eg];B[ne]C[Looking at this move now it seems bad.  It invites the white response and doesn't seem to gain much in return.  I generally lack an understanding of when to attack the weak point in this joseki.. obviously in this case I didn't give myself a chance to at all.  I'm curious what moves you would consider at this point.

T : I don't think this is bad, it makes your moyo grow, and is sente. The thing is, this move means "I want influence and moyo", so for instance san-san is not that big anymore.]
;W[ld];B[pk];W[pb]
(;B[qc]C[T : I wouldn't answer this and would solidify my moyo, with O3 for instance (a white invasion around L3 or so could end weakening H4).]
;W[gd]C[This seems a little too cautious from W.. I don't know how I would invade there.

T : I agree, playing L13 seems more urgent, making white's moyo bigger and black's smaller.]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[cj]C[Any thoughts on how better to fight here are welcome, though I think it came out clearly in my favor.

T : You should play light here, exactly as you did, white was greedy and captured some stones, putting too much effort in it. One thing about the reduction point, you should be aware (before move 27) that you can play the monkey jump at A11, or B12, so this area is not so easy for white to make points. Maybe you should aim at making your moyo bigger with D7 instead (for instance).]
;W[bj];B[cl];W[bk];B[dj];W[bl];B[em];W[dl];B[el];W[dm];B[dn]
;W[cm];B[fk];W[en]C[T : This feels so wrong by white, now black will connect all his stones and the moyo will be very solid.]
;B[fn];W[eo];B[fo];W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[lp]C[At this point I considered playing up high, but I thought that would invite an invasion at the edge.  Is this acceptable?  Would the 3rd line be better?

T : There is aji around E3, but as earlier around R17 this is not the main topic now, ad building the moyo is good. I would play O3, aiming at territory easier.]
;W[np];B[nn]C[T : This is strange, but seems to work not so bad. Anyway, be careful with moves like this, because black has a lot of cutting points etc. If you're not sure of what you want, it could end like everything is destroyed. When playing this, you need to know if you want to make points on the left or lower side,  or if you want attack/kill white (killing seems impossible), you need a target.]

(;B[pr]C[T : This feels not so big, white can't really get an eye here (the best is R2 but it's more like yose move. I would play M2 I think, reducing white eye space while taking points.]
;W[lr]C[T : White gets an eye in "sente", if you don't block with L2 for instance, white will probably get two eyes.]
;B[lm]C[I think this was a mistake.. perhaps better at P5?

T : When you play this, you should have thought before : ok white can try to live on the lower edge, I will connect my group and make a moyo. You must have a target at this point, if you want to kill - or at least, attack - white, you should try for him not to make eyes easily.]
;W[jr];B[jq];W[ir];B[iq];W[hr];B[gq]C[T : I don't really like this sequence, white got eyeplace in sente, black didn't gain much.]
;W[jn];B[km];W[jo];B[lf];W[qk]C[Better ideas for how to fight this are welcome.]
;B[qj];W[ql]C[T : this is a standard invasion, and the big point is S10 now. As you saw, if white takes it you can't block him very effectively, so he will probably live.]

C[T : This is a yose move. If you think all groups are more or less settled and this is big, answer it. If you think there are more urgent moves to play (like attacking M5), ignore it :) .]

(;B[ie]C[I took some time to decide whether to invade at the 3rd line or simply push in from this group.  I'm not sure hwo best to invade in this case if it is possible.  I left one variation as an idea, but your thoughts would be great.

T : Invading here seems crazy. Unless you have counted and think you're way behind and needs this kind of thing, play "safe" moves.]

;W[mr];B[ns]C[T : This is a very bad mistake ! If you think the group is dead, and if you have read what would happen, it's OK, but if it's just like "ok, this seems to be a vital point, i'll play it", it's very bad. I really thing the worse thing in a go game is to try to kill a group that lives eventually, because more often the attacker will lose a lot in the meantime. Attacking a group is OK, and when it's surrounded and it becomes a tsumego, ok, why not try to kill (or if you're way behind and it's your only way to win). But here, if you think white could struggle to live, first enclore him with K8 for instance, it gives your points, and if white answers you have sente (and if he doesn't answer, maybe it's time to try to kill). Basically here O1 only lose you points.]

At some points you should think about questions like : how is the game, am I ahead/behind in points/influence ? Is it enough to secure my points and game will be OK, or do I need to actively attack/invade somewhere ? When white invades or plays for points, is this important globally ? Do I want  a moyo, points, etc ?

I hope my comments were helpful :)])
