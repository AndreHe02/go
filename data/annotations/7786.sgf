;W[cf];B[cd];W[df];B[fc];W[cj];B[bl]C[J: It is painful to play a defensive move, but it seems needed here. It does make future invasions possible, such as B12 , since you can connect to either side.]

During this exchange, white also captured a stone and solidified his left side. He no longer needs to worry about a black play at B12 threatening his entire group.]

If you had connected here initially, white would not be able to expect much in the center. You were also entitled to some territory on the bottom. You were each able to gain territory, but white seemed to get much more than he deserved.]

J: W+3.5
You didn't lose by much.
You were very fotunate that you were able to recover from a poor corner exchange in the lower right.

There were 2 points in this game where you ignored your opponent to either grab or destoy territory, but allowed your opponent to gain or destroy more. One was the monkey jump on the left side at move 169. The other was a series of moves that focused on the bottom, while ignoring white's center.

You made several moves to surround territory on the bottom, while you were open from the other side. Your opponent let that work for you here, but you shouldn't have gotten the territory you did.

You also missed joseki opportunities in the lower right and upper left. In the lower right, you were lucky to come out with anything. Even at the end of the game, you can see that you formed no territory there and you just have a snake of stones leading out. You also missed an oppertunity in the upper left to develop your stones on the side with a pincer. 

The 3 things I think you should work on:
1. Try not to let yourself be blinded by moves that seem to surround or destroy a large territory, when your opponent has larger moves available. Try to find your opponents best move.

2. Don't enclose territory while your "skirt" is open.

3. Study joseki! This is the easiest to work on. Learn a new joseki and when it is best applied. If you have a game where you aren't sure what joseki would work with the arrangement of stones, try to find a joseki that would have worked after the game.
