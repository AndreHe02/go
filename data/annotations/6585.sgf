C[FM: Hello, I am Field Mouse. My comments will begin with FM:. :-)]
;AB[dd][dp][pp]C[This was my first handicap game, so I was somewhat
unsure of how agressively to play. Please help me to learn
what I can do to improve my game.];W[od];B[qd];W[fc]
(;B[kc]LB[ic:B][cf:A]C[Perhaps A would be better? I didn't play it since white
could play at B and then build a large base. Your
thoughts?


FM: I think beginning some fight here is possible, though this place is strange as after white B, which is natural, it has no good attacking power on the P16 stone.]
;W[ic]C[H];B[ec]C[FM: The corner is not really important now, when the board is empty and especially when having stone like L17 it is better so build power instead of points.]
;W[fd]
(;B[oc]C[FM: interesting idea, though it feels like forcing white to attack the middle stone.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[Too agressive, or not I just not play optimally afterwards?

FM: interesting variation! I would not think about it before.  It seems to be better than just connecting at Q17.]
;W[pc];B[ob];W[pd]
(;B[nb]C[FM: good and calm move];W[qe];B[pb];W[qb]LB[rb:B][qf:A]
C[FM: although white shape looks nice, the aji if A and B makes it a fair position.]
;B[df]LB[cf:A][ch:B]C[A is better.

FM: This is the fighting style: of course your opponent will think about  B when you play like this. You just have to have some plan prepared for that case.]
;W[ch]LB[cf:C][ff:B][bg:D][eg:A][cj:E]C[FM: this move is extra frequent in handicap games. Now there are three basic responses: A or B, C or D and E.

A and B seems to be bad in this position as the upper white group is quite ok and can make shape with J15 or L18

The choice is between C-D and E.]
(;B[ck]C[FM:This move is too far and makes it possible for white to make good shape.]
;W[ce];B[de];W[cf];B[dg];W[ci]C[FM: this result is good for white]
;B[cd];W[ei]LB[ek:A]C[I wanted to play at A, but would that be premature?

FM: A really looks very nice];B[id]C[FM: I dont know if this move is the best on the board, but I have a nice feeling about it.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[jc];B[kd];W[mc]C[FM: This move is very bad. White wanted to get the Q19 move for himself, but gives up the O15 atari, which is much more important.]
;B[md];W[fg]
(;B[cn]C[FM: Big and safe point.];W[qn]
(;B[pl]C[FM: this side is not iinteresting for black now.];W[on]
;B[nq];W[pj];B[nl];W[mn]
(;B[qj]LB[nj:A][ll:B][kp:C]C[Mistake, should be at A or B.

FM: just C is also playable now.]
(;W[qk];B[pk];W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[FM: this move looks to be a little tesuji, but loses one liberty and lowers the power of black shape a lot.]
;W[rm];B[pm];W[pn]
(;B[ro]C[FM: This move secures some territory, but also forces white to protect his weakness.]
;W[rn];B[rj];W[rk]
(;B[oj]C[Would playing atari the other way be better?

FM: There are many many variations and the decising about this move is just the moment when players spent 20 minutes of their thinking time on a tournament. I have added some for inspiration. This move looks a bit strange as it forces white to attack the right stones, but probably is possible.]

and tell me if my analysis was wrong. Thanks so much for
reviewing this!


FM: I hope my comments will help you and that I didnt make any mistake in the variations. This is my first review on GTL so please let me know your opinion about it :)
Thank you, Field Mouse])
