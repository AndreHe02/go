C[Hi, my name is Klaus (Kirus) . I´m playing white against black.
 I think I´m somewhere between 17k and 15 k.

 Something that really disturbs me is a feeling that I just won because of my oponnent mistakes, and not because of good playing.
 Thanks for any help.

*Hi, my name is Roger (rog on KGS).  I'll precede my comments with an asterisk.

It is a bit hard to review this game for white.  After all, the final score is w +50+ which really is a very big margin.  This fact, together with your statement that you lost because your opponent made mistakes, leaves me really having to review the game for black.  But I'll do my best to be helpful.

Generally, you played well.  I think black failed to take advantage of your weak groups, so against a stronger player you may be punished for these. It would be more useful to send a review request for a game which you lost by up to 10 to 15 points.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[op]C[*Black moves into the widest space and moves in an incomplete corner]
;W[oq];B[pn];W[pp];B[oo]LB[jc:A]C[* if you count the intersections between q6 and q16 and then b/w q16 and d16, you'll see that the top is wider.  This means that if you play on the top side (say, around A)  then you have more opportunity to live and you spoil more black area.  Further, black is undercut on the right side so he'll have to play an extra move to convert  the right into territory.  

Unless of course, black wants the centre (P5 is influence-oriented).]
;W[qf];B[md]C[* Really should be at O17 unless black wants white to invade corner and then take the right side.]
;W[qi]C[White creates a base...];B[qk]LB[oj:C][pk:B][mq:A]C[* This move by black means he can attack the white group with a view to gaining profit / influence.  The white group has room for one eye and is flanked by 2 black groups.  white should help this group.  Best way?  Threaten the weaker black group, i think (see variation)]

(;W[mq]LB[of:B][oj:C][dn:A]
(;B[dn];W[cn];B[dk]C[*Just c7 is better i think - black could set up a big moyo]
;W[cf]LB[fc:B][fd:A]
(;B[fd]C[*again f17 would be good];W[jd]LB[lc:B][ke:A]C[* as white, you have 4 weak 'groups' that can be attacked.  Black should have attacked more strongly in the game.  Your plays look like a high-handi game AND you managed to make them live.  You are right - this can partly be attributed to black's passive play.]

(;B[ke]C[*i prefer m17];W[je]C[*This black move might be ok if he had a plan to attack white's R11,14 group later.  Somehow, I don't think black had this (or any other) plan.]
;B[he]C[*these plays by black contradict his earlier moves that wanted the top.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[ic];B[hd];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[jf];W[kf]C[* this looks like a good move - separating black and leaving cutting points in his shape.]

LB[cd:A][ci:B][jj:C][gk:D]C[*Black has inconsistent plans - moves like A-D would at least have his stones working together.]
;W[dq];B[ip]LB[fp:B][kp:A]
(;W[kp];B[im]C[*A quick look at the board and you have to ask the question - what does black want?  

Top left corner?  Undercut on 2 sides.
Top right? Ditto
Right side?  undercut.
Left hand side / middle?  Undercut with holes and a bit of white aji to boot.

The game is already white's unless black can secure a large middle / left.]
