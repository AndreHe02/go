# Hi, I'm your reviewer, I mark my comments like this

S.

hello,

in this game black plays a rather aggressive game. Obviously since I lost I must have made many many mistakes. This is why I am submitting it for review.

Thanks in advance

#
# Often single mistake is more than enough, but will see. :)
#];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[ce]C[#
# Very unconventional. 
#];W[cd]C[#
# Simple and solid. Black stone is 
# badly placed now. 
#];B[db]TR[fc][bd][ch]C[S.

I found this very strange, I figured I would play somewhat patiently.

#
# This move is simply a wishful try
# to create some confusion. 
# (Triangled places would be viable
# plans. )
#
# you can even choose to ignore
# this move or get F17 for good
# shape and hard time for black.];W[ec]C[#
# not so good shape for white, however crawling at the second line certainly painful for black.]
;B[eb];W[fc];B[bc];W[bd];B[cc];W[bb]MA[ce]TR[fb]C[#
# No need to do this. 
# Just close in black, or simply set up # your moyo. The lone black stone
# is completely useless. good result 
# for white.];B[ab];W[ba];B[fb];W[gb]TR[gc]C[#
# You have just created a cut
# for yourself, gave 2 stones
# to black and made it alive.
#  
# It is unneccessary.
#];B[ca];W[ci]C[S.

If black insists on living then I might as well use my thickness]
;B[dg]C[S.

Perhaps I should have pushed black down?]

# B14 is not important since

Black has a baseless group but I cant say my groups are so much stronger


# Sure, but ...
# 1. you shouldn't expect black
# to play bad moves like C13
# 2. black do not need a base
# since it is out to the center. 
# 3. Your white group is also 
# without base *and* is not out
# to the center. Black will play to 
# (a) making a nice moyo *and*
# attack your group.];B[gc]C[
# sooner or later this cut was 
# inevitable. Please consider
# the variation (see var) where 
# you've simply played F18
# instead of B18.

#  Anyway, the left side is more important now.]
(;W[gd];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic]
(;W[dn]C[S.

Just trying to settle myself

# Yes. You have to. (You had to
# much earlier.)

# however this move is a little bit far
# away. Black can initiate a heavy 
# fighting at d8 or claim a solid 
# territory at the bottom.];B[cl]C[S.

black wants all the things


# And (s)he is right. White 
# group is very weak. 
# Splitting attack can be 
# advantegous.
# I would prefer D8 though.]
(;W[dl]C[S.

I guess attaching wasnt the best move

# yes, the cap (e8) may be better.
# but it is ok.];B[co];W[cn]TR[cm]C[

#  stabilizing your shape

So I dont think I can attack black any time soon, might as well poke at his weak points now that the group is settled

Now that I think about it through the other white stones arent 100% secure either.

Could have saved the group as well...

# It was a violent but interesting
# fighting game. 
# some final thoughts:

* you shouldnt want to kill so eagerly.
let your opponent to make agressive invasions. reactly calmly, play safe, make base. And watch how those weak groups kill themselves.

* do not try to cut where you know you cant and do not try to connect where you know you cant.

* try to find multiple purpose moves. Do not concentrate on single target! Aim multiple targets or attack *and* deffend, or attack and build. (usually it means attacking from secure distance.)

Keeping these in mind, you will advance I'm sure. Otherways  your fighting skills were spectacular sometimes.
