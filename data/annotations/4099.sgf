;B[qm];W[jp];B[cf];W[fc];B[cn];W[fq]C[Up to this point I felt the game was realtively even - and I still retained the first move advantage]
;B[fe]TR[gd][ef]C[What about this move - it seemed like a good idea at the time but I wasn't really happy with the result

This move is dull
The common moves are marked.

E14 is good enough, and a far better result than a pushed down side and a weak group.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di];W[ce]C[Surely being connected to your cut stone was better.]
;B[hc]C[I thought I needed to do something with this stone (otherwise white's area looks too big) but was this premature?

Should I re-inforce my own moyo instead?

!!!  This was a terrible result.  you know have a group that is a great reliability.  In position counting, having a group like this can be counted as -10 points.  Bad result!  Also, don't be jealous that W gets territory to the point you're willing to have w drag your group around the board for the sake of 4-6 points along the side.]
;W[jc];B[fb];W[eb];B[fd];W[ec];B[he]TR[hc][fd][fe]C[OK I seem to have made some shape here but the triangled group seems a bit heavy]
;W[pb];B[pr];W[ph];B[qc]TR[ph]C[trying to push upward to build strength to attack  the triangled stone]
;W[qg];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[mc]C[You should not have gotten this kind of exchange.]
;B[oh]C[Is this the right way here - or should I come from below with R11?

W's invasion is very crazy...but this helps w
I'd tenuki for reinforcing your stranded floating group on the top.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qj];B[qk];W[pk];B[oj];W[rk];B[ql];W[ri]C[White has lived on the side but at this stage I felt  that I had quite good compensation in the black wall.
Could I have done better here?

Don't make a wall unless you understand what the strength of the wall means.   Considering your weak groups, you're losing by this point.]
;B[lq]C[The invasion seems natural

No, it doesn't.  It seems very boring, and ignoring the rest of the board.  This invasion is clearly overplay.]
;W[mq]C[but this response was unexpected - never seen it before. I thought it must be bad because

This response is terrible.];B[lp]C[it lets me cut white in two like this]
;W[no];B[lo]C[but then I found that this was the only move and my stones felt heavy -  all the lighter moves seemd vulnerable to cutting.

Perhaps I should have started with the one point jump instead of the solid extension?

It's fine...but don't be a wuss to play the 1 point extension.]
;W[nm];B[ol]C[Now white seems to be escaping and I feel I have to defend - its starting to go wrong...

You think this w group will die?  This move of B is defending what?  A single stone is worth more than stabilizing b's bottom group with m7?  If you don't know what you're doing, play from the weak side!]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pn];B[op]C[Just connecting at R6 seemed to be making it too easy for white]
;W[mo]C[You now have miai weaknesses.  The game is over.];B[oo]
C[Overplay.  Just connect.];W[on];B[mm]C[I felt I needed to defnd the m4 stones so I couldn't afford to defend at r6. I thought that I could keep white separated and defend the corner - which I did in the end - but at some cost

Play simple.  P8 was the wasted move.];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn];B[rl]
;W[sl];B[sm];W[sk];B[rm];W[sn];B[pl];W[rq]C[Arrgh

Now the best I can do is a ko. I thought that white had a better sequence than the one he chose however]
;B[qq];W[rr];B[so];W[qr];B[oq];W[nr];B[or]C[I thought that w s4 produced a better result for white than the game - see variation]

(;B[rp];W[ns]C[You were better off playing o1 first, to connect out, and letting w live in the corner.]

(;B[sq]LB[ln:A][mn:B]C[Now I get the first capture and white needs an approach move  - hwever I reckon I should have played A or B  instead

This is all because of P8.  All of this weakness is unreasonable.  You'd ko your corner for P8.]
;W[ln];B[jo];W[mn]C[W got the vital point in shape.  You now have a very weak group on the outside.]
;B[ko];W[sp]C[Both sides trying to mingle ko threats with the fight around m4 its all very confusing - but were there better options for either side here?]
;B[rj];W[sj];B[sq];W[og];B[pg];W[qf];B[ng];W[sp];B[of]C[I must cut off all the threats in the top left

W has won.];W[np];B[sq];W[jm]C[Now I have to finish the ko but my m4 group is in trouble.....

Yes, it should die.  Never put yourself at these risks.];B[ss]
;W[ip];B[io]C[With hindsight j5 looks better - but would it have been any use?]
;W[hm]
(;B[hn]C[Now the diagonal move - but with hindsight (again)  was g5 better - or have I misread it.

I was relying on following at  f5 here but in the event it didn't seem to work.]
;W[gm];B[hp];W[hq]C[Now I'm in big trouble - and the next move doesn't help at all.
Is there any escape now?
 
It's ko to escape.]
(;B[iq];W[gp];C[Result: W+Resign

This is still ko.
But!  Go is not about this nonsense.  Playing as a dan player requires you to be able to stay out of these kinds of sticky situations.
