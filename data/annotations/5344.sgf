RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[this is my ttengen macht i would liike pointer but no ur still a 30kyu u dont need to know about tengen no disrespecting but i hear that alot]
;B[pd]C[Degan:  I would say the level of play is above 30k.  You may get more out of the review if you go through the game and review it yourself first, give some idea as to what you were thinking when you played moves and what you wanted to accomplish.]
;W[jj];B[pp]C[i win in this game by 29+5 but my oopponent got fustrated i and resign i think i would like to know my mistakes and what i could of done better and also if i played good or bad

Degan: I am guessing that the above statement is by white.  White loses by resignation.  ScoreEst says white is ahead by 29.5.  ScoreEst is only a guess of sorts.  I do not understand "opponent got frustrated".]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[jd];B[fq];W[dj]LB[cn:A][dn:B][hq:C]C[Degan: Usually it is valuable to respond to a threat.  A or B are most common.  C is also possible.]
;B[pj];W[jp]C[Degan: All the hoshi are filled, plenty of suspense...]
;B[mp]LB[jp:A][dq:C][iq:B][dr:D]SQ[fq]C[Degan: Good play.  With marked stone, threatens A.  B,C,D all good.]

;B[mo]C[Degan: Good response - makes the right side strong.]

(;B[lp]LB[mq:A]C[Degan: A is the clear play instead.  With one more stone captures the corner and right.  See variation.]
