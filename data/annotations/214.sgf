[0.5]HA[2]GC[Game reviewed by  Steven J.C. Mays on July 31, 1995 for Alf Mikula.]
;W[qp]C[General  Observation: From the analysis of this one game I would say that your opening  is weak in regards to two points: (1) You have to try to play on a larger  scale and to play in such a way as to maximize your options; and (2) You must  try to maintain sente more effectively. In this game, Black kept sente more  effectively, and usually got to play the big moves first. I hope my comments  will illustrate my observations.]
;B[dd];W[qf];B[nd];W[qi]L[pj]M[qp]C[Many players, including myself, would tend to play at  'a'. A stone a 'a'  works well with the marked stone and allows White to spread his influence  more widely on the board. As it is, the white stones are too close  together.]
;B[dj];W[nq]L[fq][jp][dn]C[This is a matter of taste, but I would have  played at 'a'. Again the idea is for White to spread his influence on the  board in the beginning. By playing where you did you allow Black to play at  'b', thereby allowing him to spread his influence. If, in response to 'a',  Black plays at 'c', then White can play at 'b' himself.]
;B[jp];W[kq]L[jq]M[dp]C[This is not a good move. The reason is that it forces  Black to play at 'a', which re-inforces his position, and allows him to have  a position that works well with his marked stone.]
;B[jn]C[Naturally, in  light of the previous comment, Black did not play well here.]
;W[fc]L[jq]C[Although playing tenuki is not bad, I would have played at 'a' immediately.  This is a big move.]
;B[fe]C[It's obvious that Black is playing in a  consistent manner, and is going for central influence.]
;W[ic];B[kc];W[jd]L[kd][je][ke][db][cc]C[Again, White is giving Black the opportunity to  solidify his postion.  If Black plays at 'a' White will want to play at 'b'  thus giving Black the chance to play at 'c'.  Instead, White should have  played at 'd' and if Black plays at 'e', then White can take the initiative  and play elsewhere knowing that his group is alive. In the beginning both  players should  want to play in such a way as to maximize their options and  maintain their abillity to keep the initiative. Helping your opponent to  solidify his positions goes against this spirit.]
;B[jc];W[ib]L[id]C[The  right move ('honte' in Japanese) is to connect at 'a'. It may appear slow,  but it is solid.]
;B[he];W[db];B[cc];W[cb]L[id]C[Connecting at 'a' is far  more important. It is important because White must maintain access to the  center]
;B[id]C[Black was right not to respond to White's last move and to cut  instead. Now, White's group at the top is isolated from the center, and its  role in influencing the rest of the game will be limited.]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[gd];B[ge]N[Crossroads!]C[White is now faced with a difficult decision. Black  has built up a large moyo. Where should White play next? Remeber that White  should want to find a move that will allow him to keep the initiative and  maintain his options, look at the variartions.]

(;W[gq]C[I don't think this is  the right move, as Black's subsequent moves will demonstrate.]
;B[go]L[jj][og]C[Black is playing very well. A sequence is beginning that will  allow Black to play 2 very big moves (at 'a' and 'b'). Again, White is  playing in such a way as to allow Black to gain the initiative too often.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[ep];B[eo];W[fp];B[fo];W[jq]L[jj]C[Although this is big,  giving sente to Black to play at 'a' is questionable.]
;B[jj];W[kp]L[og]C[White's move here is simply too small, whereas Black's next move at 'a' is  very big.]
;B[og];W[of];B[nf];W[pg];B[oe]L[ng]C[Black made a mistake  here, he should have played at 'a']
;W[oh];B[ln];W[nn];B[lj]L[nj]C[Good  move for Black, but perhaps he should have played even more deeply, like at  'a'.]
;W[nj];B[cq];W[dr]L[cj]C[Responding to Balck's move is too small.  White should have taken the initiative and invaded at 'a', Black's vulnerable  spot at this stage of the game.]
;B[cj]C[Very good move for Black];W[ng];B[mf];W[be]C[Good move.];B[cf];W
[bc];B[bf];W[cd];B[de];W[hm]C[This invsion is too  deep inside of Black's moyo.]
;B[gl]L[ll][jl]C[In my opinion, Black  should have played at 'a' or 'b', but I can understand his worry.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[kn];B[kl];W[lm];B[ko];W[lo];B[jo];W[ll];B[kk];W[ho]L[qc]
C[What  is White hoping to accomplish? A far better move would have been to invade at  'a'.]

;B[mh];W[mg];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[lf];B[jf];W[me]L[qc]C[A much bigger  move would have been the invasion at 'a'.]

;B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[kb]L[sd]C[Although this is not an insignificant move, it would be much better to play  a sente move like at 'a' first, then come back to play where you did.]
;B[ne];W[pe];B[od];W[qe];B[iq]C[Look at all of Black's moves up to B136, see how  long he keeps sente. Keeping sente (the initiative) is paramount in go.]

C[This option is not too bad since Black is left with a very  large open area in the bottom left quater of the board and that White's  marked stone is well poised to do some damage in that sector of the board.]

(;W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[fp];W[bj];B[cj];W[bk];B[bi];W[dl];B[ch]M[kq]C[This is  another possibility, again the marked stone is well poised to some damage in  the bottom. The drawback to this variation is that the black group in the top  left quarter is not wide open for invasion, its territory is only  reducible.]
