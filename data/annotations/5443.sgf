AB[pd][dp]C[Dear Reviewer,

I played as white in this game and lost by 3.5. In this game, instead of fighting I tried to outbuild my opponent. I made a mistake and had some stones captured. Any advice and tips to improve are appreciated. If any books are recommended to improve, suggestions are welcome.

Thank You,

A.D. White's move is just perfect];B[dl]

A.D. Both ways are possible -];B[cm];W[bn];B[bl]C[A slow move. Black may think about tennuki]
;W[ck];B[cl];W[oq]C[White is happy to take sente];B[or];W[op]

(;B[nq]MA[nr]C[A joseki, but the extension at X puts more pressure on White -]

(;W[pr]C[I think next time I'll take the corner in a handicap game

A.D. Both ways are possible, but right now it's better to take the corner -]
;B[qr];W[nr];B[ps];W[mq]C[It's a joseki, but now White's wall is useless]
;B[ch]C[The ladder breaker is quite passive];W[no]C[The wrong way to defend. It's always better to capture the stone directly, destroying adji]
;B[jd];W[qp]
(;B[qq]C[The corner is big, but tennuki is possible -]
(;W[qc]C[Is R14 or P17 better here

A.D. The invasion at san-san is gentle, but quite passive for handicap games -]

;B[qf];W[pj]C[A good move];B[pk];W[nj]C[Should I continue with P10. I didn't know which was better because black is thick on top and the left. looking at it now. white is thick on the bottom too

A.D. The move in the real game is just perfect];B[oj];W[oi]

A.D. Yes, tennuki was better];B[qh];W[qj];B[rj];W[rl];B[rk]

;B[mn];W[jr]C[A good move];B[gc]C[Each side made some mistakes and the position is still close to 2-handicap game.]
;W[gb]LB[ic:B][hc:A]C[A bad move, making Black stronger. It was better to keep the invasions at A or B in reserve]
;B[fb];W[fc];B[hb];W[gd];B[hc];W[eb];B[ga];W[nf]MA[cf]C[White seems thin. Would J6 be better here

A.D. I think, that your group is quite strong. I would prefer to extend at X]

A.D. Yes, it's sente];W[fd];B[fh];W[hn];B[ln];W[kn]MA[li]C[Is it better to defend at X?]
;B[ko];W[dh]C[I looks like the center is missing two eyes. I didn't defend because I didn't think black would attack correctly if the white group can die

A.D. Yes, it was a good decision];B[di];W[dg];B[ci];W[bg];B[bh]

A.D. Yes, you did];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[bj];B[cj];W[ea]C[The largest place on the board. The position is still close]

A.D. Yes, you made a big mistake. Now W cannot block at X];W[kk]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[il]TR[nh][mg][mh][mi]C[White lost more than 15 points here. Later you played well, even capture the marked stones, but it was too late ...
