KM[0.5];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[jp];W[nq];B[lq];W[pq];B[dj]C[This is your first mistake, I think.  Instead, play R3.]
;W[qp];B[po]C[rather than this move, which doesn't accomplish anything offensive,
I'd recomment a hane at R5 or a cross-cut at R3.  That way you get a  trade-off rather than just a liability.]
;W[qo];B[fc]C[Your two stones are not very useful now.  Making them 3 long makes them much harder to kill.   Or you could try the hane at R6, the cut at R3, or perhaps N5 aiming to  sacrifice the two stones for some profit.]
;W[pn]C[now you are wise to give these up, as you did.];B[cf];W[eb]C[I don't think this is a particularly good move by white.]

;B[pi];W[qk];B[pk];W[qj];B[pj];W[qi]C[Now a stone at R12 would be sente, and a good reinforcement for you.]

;W[dl];B[el];W[em];B[ek];W[dm];B[in]C[This move should have been held in reserve, since you might want to attack at H7 instead.]
;W[hm];B[gj];W[co]C[I think you can probably play D5 safely.];B[cp];W[do]
;B[bo];W[cn];B[hn]C[Since white already has two eyes easily, this move is wasted.]

;B[nh];W[rf];B[od];W[nc]C[Now you should continue to attack the corner, with Q17.  This will keep the stones around N16 weak.]

;B[if];W[ih];B[ki];W[ig];B[kg];W[lh];B[jh];W[mi]C[I would attack now with N12, N10, or O11.  The Ko is not a threat to you, particularly, becaluse you can seal it off.]
;B[ji];W[mj];B[mh];W[nj];B[le]C[??];W[me];B[nl];W[ml];B[mk]C[you need to prepare for a wedge like this.  Perhaps N7 or O9 or P8 first.]
;W[nk];B[lk];W[ol];B[nm];W[ok];C[As a general comment, keep an eye out for aggressive defenses for both yourself and your opponent.]
