C[Hi there, 

my name is Marc and I am currently ~8kyu.
I have spent a lot of time to review the game.

So please take a close look on my comments and the variations.
I also mentioned a lot of things you might not be able to understand/see today
but when you've got much stronger (lets say ~12 kyu).
So it might be a good idea to have a look on this game again when you are stronger.

If you keep on playing Go you will truly become much better!

So don't give up!

Conclusion
------------------
This game was really not  bad for 20kyu (in my opinion).
Fortunately, white has not punished blacks mistakes (and amusingly the other way around :D).

Black  should have a better look on his cutting points and play more
solid moves at the beginning and in the mid-game instead of hane....

Playing hane is (of course) not wrong in general. But the player who plays it
should keep in mind, that playing hane may leave some cutting points for his/her opponent.

Another problem was that black sometimes fight for small points instead of looking for the
big points (or open corners).
Loosing 3 or 4 points but winning 20  (or even more) is worth it :-).

Recommendations
-----------------------------
* Train Fuseki
   -> Studying Joseki (for the Fuseki): http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm
   -> Study fuseki of some 2kyu - 4 Dan games (you may have a look on games from KGS...).
        => You will recognise that in most games the players will concentrate
              on the corners and borders (in fuseki) instead of playing stones in (or near to)  the center of the board

* Keep on studying Life & Death problems!!! Especially keep in mind that your opponent needs
   two eyes to keep his/her group alive!!!

* When you play on the 19x19 board, take a look on the whole(!) board from time to time!
  Watch out for weak groups (yours and of your opponent), open corners (where you can easily create a good mojo) and
  good invading (and attacking) positions.

* When you are stronger (~12kyu ) keep 'sente" in mind. Sente in Go means that you have the initiative.
  So whenever it's your turn AND you have the initiative try to think of "Does my opponent has to react on that move?" ( when the   
  answer is 'No' try to find another move).
  This implies that you are able to punish your opponent when he plays elsewhere (instead of reacting on your move)!]
FG[259:]PM[2];B[md];W[ld];B[jd];W[le];B[lc]C[I am very new to the game,
and don't actually know how to respond to this. Is there a stronger play
I could have made in response?

------------------------

Blacks response with K12 (to w M12) is pretty interesting.
I think it is nice.];W[lf];B[ll]LB[kc:A]C[

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Please have look on the variatons for white here!]

(;B[lh]LB[kl:A]C[
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Altough M8 is interesting I wonder about the intention of your move...
Do you want to prevent that the 3 white upper stones  to get connected with bottom 2??

In my opinion black should better play at A to get a thicker mojo in the corner!
Even if white is able to connect the stones she won't get much points or influence there.]
;W[kg];B[jg]LB[dc:B][kc:1][dd:C][kd:A][dl:E][kl:F][dm:D]C[Here I thought it might be good to support the stones
in the corner, but I tried not to abandon the stone at m-8. I am not sure
I did it well.

----------------------

The triangled stone is too slow (weak) and definitly does not support the corner stones.

In order to get a strong top right corner I would recommend A to prevent white to cut off K12 with '1' (see the previous variations).
Other good moves are B-E or simply continue at the bottom right with F.

Personally, I think F would be the best here.

Note: The thing about Fuseki (Go opening Phase) is to get a good starting position for the mid-game.
So it is a good idea to obtain solid corners to get easy points.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[jh];B[jf];W[lg];B[li];W[kl]LB[ml:A][lm:B]C[Black should respond with either A (prefered) or B.]

(;B[km]LB[ml:1][lm:2]TR[mk][ll]C[I am told a double hane is usually a bad play, but it felt appropriate
here.

The thing is that w has some dangerous cutting points at 1 and 2.
So L3 is a bad move.];W[jm];B[kn];W[jn]LB[mm:A]C[
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Black should respond with A to make everything secure!]
(;B[mj]LB[lm:1]C[I have had my stones split before, so I
wanted to be sure I could connect these if I needed to. The corner felt
secure.

The corner isn't save because of the cutting point at 1.
Black should better play N3 instead of N6.]

C[---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should really keep that shape in mind.
It's really bad for black because white can give
a double atari with 1 and destroy blacks corner.]

;W[ml];B[mm]C[Oops. Missed that.];W[lm];B[nl]C[Does he see it too?]
;W[mn]C[Apparently not. Lucky me.];B[ll]C[I was only half proud of this. I didn't plan it, and should have
seen it coming. It also only worked because my opponent made a mistake.]

and sneak in.];W[nm];B[ml];W[ji];B[nn];W[mh];B[mi]LB[dc:A][dd:B]
[dl:D][dm:C]C[N7 is to slow.
If white plays N7 black can still connect with M6.

;B[oi];W[nf]C[This surprised me. If it were me, I'd have
simply played O-9, but after seeing this I can see it's a much stronger
play.];B[nd];W[je]LB[kd:A]C[----------------------------------------------------------
A is a very important move for black here.]
(;B[ie]LB[dc:A][kc:1][dd:B][kd:E][dl:D][dm:C]TR[jh][ji]C[I wasn't sure what to play here, but it felt
right. Would L-11 have been better?

-----------------------------------------------------------

No J11 is just too slow (not so good...).
Black can do better with L12 (E) to get a large corner or play somewhere from A - D.

Note, that white can still cut of black with 1 and is able to run out with the two triangled stones...

You can say, playing at the center in fuseki is seldomly good!]
;W[ke];B[kd];W[if];B[ig];W[hf];B[hg]LB[id:1]C[----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note that the cut at J12 (1) may cause a lot of trouble for black.

As the game will get too complicate I will only give you one good variation for black :D.
Please, note that  black has a lot of cutting point here (that's what causes the trouble)]

(;W[he]SQ[lc][jd][kd][md][nd]C[I asked my brother to go over this with me, and he
says white should have played J-12. Which would have forced me to play
H-11, and then killed the group above at L-11

If w would have played J12 it might causes some trouble, but I think
w wouldn't be able to kill the whole (marked) group.];B[id]
;W[gg];B[gf]C[Interesting move :-) (really not bad).

On the other hand, it makes the game complicated for both (black an white).]

to the group on the right, and did not see my error in placing this stone
until it was too late.];W[hj];B[ij]TR[jf][hg][ig][jg][ih][ii]
C[This was a difficult choice, and took
me nearly all of five minutes to make, but I decided that saving this group
by connecting to the right was more important than the two stones in the
middle.

here, but I get the feeling I would have failed anyway, and it was necessary

managable, and I wanted to place the first stone here. I am not sure I

White does not need to connect with F13 (see the variation) and
can cause a lot of damage....]

to capture these two stones, or connect at C-10, but I didn't want white
