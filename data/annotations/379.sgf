;W[cg];B[cm];W[bo]LB[np:A][em:B][jd:C]C[My feeling is that B5 is trying to greedily hold the corner. Don't. It is small. Instead use the outware influence of your stones try a move around A, B, or C instead. It often turns out that moves like B5 fail to capture any territory at all after an invasion at C3 or D2.]
;B[pj];W[jd]C[Seems like a solid opening. White seems to have a broader development, I might have swapped Q18 for K16 if I were black.]
;B[dc]C[This move was unclear to me. I think that the more orthodox move of C17 would have given a better result. Attachments like this or usually special purpose moves when the surrounding circumstances prohibit and invasion at the 3-3.   Not a bad move, though.]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[ed];B[fd];W[cb];B[fe];W[ef];B[id];W[ie];B[je]C[Both white and black have played well at this point.

K15 is aggressive. J17 is a bit more patient.];W[ic];B[hd];W[hc];B[he];W
[ke];B[if];W[gc];B[fc];W[kc];B[nc]LB[ld:A][kf:B][le:C]C[One possibility is to peep at A first and then play O17. Makes white heavier. Another possibility is to strengthen blacks stones with B. If white plays C, then black can play O17.]
;W[qf]C[This is a bold invasion on white's part. Too bold I would say. He is weak on the top. I would attack aggressively as black]

(;B[rd]C[This is a little too passive];W[of];B[er]LB[lq:A][hp:B]C[Black already has one weak group at the top. It is unwise to invade like this without support. Perhaps a move around A or B would be wiser.]

(;W[dr]TR[cm][cj]C[D2 doesn't keep black out of the corner. I think that E3 is better. It either locks black in the corner or flattens him out on the side while building up outside influence to attack the marked black stones.]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[eq];W[en]LB[cr:A]C[This is a good idea, keep the black groups seperated. But first you should make black run to the middle by strengthening yourself at A.]
;B[ch];W[dh]LB[bg:A]C[Instead of this simply descending at A keeps white from strengthening black, while still leavin blacks position unresolved.]
;B[di];W[bh]LB[eh:A][ei:B][fh:C]C[If white has chosen to play on top with D12, then he shouldn't switch strategies, and instead should continue with A. If black continues with B, then white can follow with C and black will be hurting his group on the top.]
;B[eh];W[ci];B[ej];W[eg];B[fh];W[bj];B[ck]C[After this trade, white has a little inside territory and black has a lot of outside influence. Plus blacks group at the top is all but secured.]
;W[gq];B[ep]C[Once again. If white wants to chase black out to the center which is a good strategy, he must first make sure that he is strong. Playing at C2 is very important. It secures white eyespace while robbing black of eyespace.]
;W[do];B[gp];W[hp];B[go];W[ho];B[cr];W[br]C[Now it is white who is in danger, and black is pratically secure.]
;B[ds];W[bp]C[Having to play B4, white loses sente, and now black can dictate the pace of the attack.]

MA[gq][hp][ho][jp]LB[lq:A]C[The marked black group can live or run. It has no worries. Instead the marked white group should be the target! Play at A and the group has nowhere to go!]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[lq]C[By playing this way black has lost the opportunity to attack.]
;B[mf]C[N14 is excellent. But it needs a good follow-up.];W[qi]
(;B[qj];W[ph]C[This lets white defend and poke out into the middle.];B[rh]
TR[qj]LB[rj:A]C[If black is going to defend with the marked stone, then he should follow up at A, not invade. White is still open at the bottom. There is no need to rush in and invade.]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[sh];B[sg];W[si];B[rf];W[nh]C[In any case. Black's attack has succeeded. White is on the run. To make this really effective get the other black group runnin too!]

(;B[kf];W[le]TR[kf];B[gl]LB[nj:A]C[This is a confusing move. The action is in the upper right. neither the black group nor the white are in any danger. Black should push with A.]

(;B[nj];W[oi];B[nl];W[mk];B[pl]C[By playing like this, black has lost all his chances of attacking white.]
