C[Hi, I started go in january from true beginner level, had a review at 22k (KGS) in Feb, and progressed steadily to 13k (KGS) currently.

But recently, i feel my progress is stuck a little and i loose many games by small margins except when i get caught in my major failure: "saving that group that is unsavable" and put lot of stones that finally get eaten (... in this case i loose larger).
So i guess it is time for another review.

I have chosen this game, it is quite quiet so it is less full of blunders like some other games. I had the feeling i was doing good but lost anyway without really knowing the reason.

I have tried to comment some moves along the game so you can correct my thinking process (i am black in the game).


RickMott: Hi!  Getting stuck is painfully normal. :)  It seems like you plateau for a long time, then some  strategic concept finally clicks and you jump two stones.

You were in fact doing fine, until you (a) missed a huge opportunity in the lower right corner, and (b) made an unnecessary defensive move which let your opponent reduce your top group on the edge.  You were ahead for 2/3 of the game, but couldn't simplify and close out the game successfully.

I recommend doing simple life-and-death problems.  They don't have to be brain-burners, just common situations with one or two move solutions.  You need to learn to recognize the dead shapes and common attacking moves.  Just doing that will improve your game a stone or two for sure.  

Also, don't panic over your opponent making territory.  It's normal.  All you have to do is make a bit more. :)   Good luck!]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp]C[Generally i would play R14 or C14, but in this game i wanted to change a bit.

RickMott: It's fine.  I suppose it's a bit unusual to have ALL the first 5 moves played on the 4th line. :)]
;W[cj];B[fc]C[Here i made a common approach, but i realize now it is maybe the wrong side, because of the extension in C10 already, white priority is not a move like C14 or D14 and he will probably just extend his other corner to pressure this stone

RickMott: No, this is OK.  There are at least three reasonable choices; this, R10-Q10, or somewhere around R14.  All are playable. The advantage of this play is that you prevent white from getting a double-wing formation.  The drawback is that it will start a local fight.  If you can come out of the fight with sente, you'll be happy.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[jc];B[ed]C[I was not sure about what to play. I though also about going 3-3 right away

RickMott: Actually, you don't have to answer at all.   You can still consider Q10 and R14.  Your group is able to escape into the center, and is not at risk of capture yet.

One of the skills that will advance your game is knowing when to tenuki (play elsewhere) and take a big point.]
;W[dc];B[ic]C[Giving some space to my stones, but quasi automatic K16 response by white let me in very constrained position. Should i play on the other side of this white stone ?

RickMott: I would not play this contact move.  I'd hane at D15, or play elsewhere on the right side.  Your group has accomplished its purpose of limiting white's moyo.]
;W[jd];B[id];W[df];B[dl]C[I didn't want to give all the edge to my opponent.

RickMott: Wrong side.  The right side is worth more.  In this position, R10 or Q10 is huge for both players, so you must take the opportunity to get there first if you can.]
;W[pj]C[RickMott: See what I mean?  Imagine the difference if this was your stone.]
;B[pl];W[jj];B[jl]C[Building large moyo seemed fine enough at this moment.

RickMott: It's OK,];W[if]
(;B[he]C[Trying to preserve eye potential.

RickMott:  You can do better.  White made a mistake by not playing J15.  You should punish him.   See variation on previous move.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[hg];B[pg]C[As the top right group seemed ok, i started to invade white moyo. This area appeared the weaker (Q10 stone is isolated, and it is away from my force and white wall).
But is Q13 point the best ? (it is symetrical, but not common corner joseki approach).

RickMott: This is a hard position to evaluate.  I think it's probably OK, but the fighting is going to be complicated.  White's wall has lots of cutting points, but you're jumping into the middle of enemy territory.

It might be easier to just keep moving out with G13, and then make a 3-3 invasion at R17.  We know that  works.]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[qf];B[qj]C[I decided to take the edge.];W[oj]
C[RickMott:  This is a mistake.  White should extend at Q11.  Then he either cuts you at Q12, or pushes through at R11 and makes your life difficult.]
;B[ph]C[RickMott:  This is a great result for you.  White should have extended to Q11 instead of P10.  Then you might not have been so happy.]
;W[cl];B[fl]C[I played toward the center to reinforce my moyo and protect the touched stone.

RickMott: I would hane at C7 instead.];W[fj]C[RickMott: Not the best move for white.  He won't get much territory because your group is above this stone.  He should continue down the left side, since you left it open.]
;B[gd]C[I felt white last move was a bit slow, and after reflexion i feared for my black group so i used this tempo to securize this shape.
Is it a wasted move ?

RickMott: Yes.  Defend the left side with C7.  If you're worried about the group, jumping to F14 or playing G13 would be better.  But white is very likely to answer C7.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cp];B[cq]C[I didn't want to give white the edge, but offered him miserably...]
;W[do];B[eo];W[dq];B[co];W[bp]
(;B[dr]C[RickMott: This is a tactical error.   See the variation on the previous move.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[cr]C[RickMott: ouch.];B[fq];W[bq];B[ep];W[cq]
(;B[cm]C[RickMott: You missed a game-winning move here.  B5 kills the corner. See variations on previous move.]
;W[bn];B[ck];W[dk];B[bl];W[ek];B[el]C[A strange atari battle i admit, but in definitive white frontier is damaged and my moyo is still preserved, so i though it was not a bad operation.

RickMott: B5 still kills the corner.  Same moves as before, but you make a sacrifice throw-in at A4 instead of a hane.  White must make a move here right now to live.  B5 and A2 both work.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[I prefered to close the moyo space from white invasion by this strong connection.s

RickMott: correct, block on the side with the most potential.  Killing the lower left is pretty big, though... :)]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[po]C[RickMott: Yeee-hah!  I think this is called "rodeo go". :)]
;B[oo]C[RickMott: extending toward the edge at S5 is better.  White's cutting stone will find it hard to live.  You don't need to atari it immediately.  S5 threatens to kill the corner and helps right-side territory.]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[qn];B[qm];W[rn];B[qr];W[rr];B[ps];W[rs]C[My play was terrible but white was terrible too. I got benefice out of it, don't know how

RickMott: Your play is not so bad.  You can't stop white from living with a 3-3 invasion.  You did fine to make a nice wall for your bottom moyo.]
;B[ff]C[Used sente to spread this group a little.

RickMott:  slow.  This group is hard to kill, and there are many unsettled places left.  If white plays here first, you simply hane at the upper edge to make eye space.]
;W[eh];B[eg]C[RickMott:  This move doesn't make your group any more safe; it's already alive.  Even if you don't see the kill in the lower left, the 3-3 invasion in the upper right is much bigger.]
;W[dg];B[fh];W[fi];B[gh];W[di];B[ig];W[jg];B[ih];W[jh];B[hh]
C[I stayed in the logic of extending my group but realized afterward that it gives me only a few points, and because of white stones K13,  K12 invasion of N15 area looks now compromised.

I realized after this exchange that white has huge top left corner and will probably make many points in the top right one.
I have a big moyo myself, but i'm starting to fear it would be reduced, i have no corner, and only a small edge on the right.

RickMott:  If you're looking at this with the KGS client, now would be a good time to select "Score Est" from the options menu.  You are ahead by 8-10 points even if the lower left group lives.  Now is not the time to dive in and start some big fight; you should try to settle the game.

For example, consider O9.  It closes the widest opening in your bottom moyo and simultaneously puts pressure on white's P10-Q10 group.  He will have to run away with it, or you'll get even more territory.]
;W[of];B[mj]C[This move was kind of multipurpose move. Enclosing P10 group, while trying to connect the moyo and Q12 triangle, also can serve as a support to extend along N column (N13 for example)

RickMott:  This move tries to do too much at once.  It leaves many weaknesses and does not really enclose the P10 group.]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[mi];B[nk]C[RickMott: White has been a bit passive, so you may get away with it.

If I were white, there are many choices now.  See variations.]
(;W[nj]C[RickMott: Poor move on white's part.  This connection is not needed.  He can cause you some trouble (see variations on prior move).]
;B[lj];W[mh]C[Well, it didn't turn as planned... (Q12 triangle lost his influence, and N15 area is totally white now).]
;B[ng]C[RickMott: Use the first line of play in the previous variations (hane at R9.  It's always better attacking the group if possible rather than just doing damage control.]
;W[nf];B[qi]C[Still a move driven by fear of being disconnected.

RickMott: Quite correct.  Up until this move, you COULD have disconnected him.  Not now, though.]
;W[mg];B[ok]C[This move is small i guess.

RickMott: Yes, and not necessary to hold the line for your moyo. L9 or G9 would be better.]
;W[ki]C[RickMott: But white responds timidly.];B[rm];W[sn];B[sm]
;W[sp];B[hj];W[kk]C[RickMott: White finally notices he can walk through the open door.]
;B[kl];W[lk]
(;B[mk]C[And here came the snake. This is something i don't know how to address while playing, i kind of panic and play systematically too close to oppoent stones.
I follow white instead of enclosing a little further. See for yourself...

RickMott: Yes.  Give up the two stones (only 4 points) and play M8.]
;W[ll];B[lm];W[ml];B[mm];W[nl];B[nm];W[ol];B[pk];W[om];B[on]
;W[kj]C[RickMott: Not necessary.  You can't cut white off.  So at least you get sente.]
;B[ij];W[pm];B[ql];W[ik];B[jk];W[il]
(;B[km]C[RickMott:  Too fearful.  You need to learn to read these situations out.  White's "threat" is an overplay; it doesn't go anywhere.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[hl]C[RickMott: This is bad.  White should drive straight down into your moyo with G8.  He will get to connect, because you must keep him from playing G7 at which would cost you many points.]
;B[gl]C[The result is not brilliant, possibilities are narrowed now and right top corner is huge!

RickMott: Not huge compaged to your bottom territory, and a 3-3 invasion is still possible.]
;W[bm];B[gj];W[fk];B[bo]C[RickMott: Dare I think you've seen it???]
;W[ao];B[do]C[RickMott: So far so good...];W[cs];B[am]C[RickMott: Oh  Noooooooo......]
;W[ap]C[RickMott: but white STILL doesn't see his danger, and fails to make life.]
;B[an]C[at least white makes mistakes too...

RickMott:  A2 would have killed  the white corner.  you don't need to take the 3 stones; you'll get them anyway.

Learning to recognize dead shapes, whatever their orientation, is critical for you to improve.  Try doing some life-and-death problems.  They don't have to be hard complicated ones.  Practice simple ones until the moves become automatic.]
;W[ar]C[RickMott: White makes life, but you have sente.  You are still ahead, if you play the endgame correctly.]
;B[fr]C[I wondered if this connection was mandatory ?

RickMott: no.  But it doesn't matter, you're still more than 10 points ahead and white can't make that up.  The positions are pretty well settled.  Should have been 40 points, though. :)]
;W[bj];B[bk]C[Very slow move, i guess i should have played S13 or something like that.

RickMott: Yes, that's big.  Hane at K18 is big too.];W[rh];B[ri]
;W[rg];B[sh];W[sg];B[si];W[ib]
(;B[rk]C[oops, i saw it just in time, but with white correct play i guess all this stuff was dead.

I think i should play S9 in place of 155, right ? Or was it 153 already ?

RickMott: No, white cannot kill you with S9.  See variations.]
;W[hb];B[hc]C[again so small, i don't benefit at all from the edge position.]
;W[fb];B[gb];W[ga];B[gc];W[ea]C[RickMott: White gets a big reduction and even makes a few points.  Now you are slightly behind.  The exchange at the top was more than a 10 point swing.]
