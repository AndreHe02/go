C[Dear Reviewer!

My fuseki is not so good, so normally I am fighting an up-hill battle from the middle game onward to the end. Being ahead after the opening is very rare for me, but in this game, after a joseki mistake of my opponent, I felt I had a won game. Anyway, I still lost it, not being able to "win the won game".

So this is what I am asking you about: Please show me why I did not win and give me some hints about how to win safely in situations like this one. Any other comments are also very welcome of course!

Please help me clarify this mess ... thank you!


FM: The game was very good for you in the beginning, but you missed a chance to finish your opponent. Outsmart your opponent once, she will try to make a comeback and fight. Outsmart her twice and she will give up. That is the psychology of go.
After you killed the corner the game was a constant line of bigger or smaller successess for your opponent. White was playing moves (many time tricks) and wanted you to answer them with a common shape and you were answering them with the common shapes because you thought you are ahead enough to win by playing that way. You accepted white challenges to fight everywhere directly while you had enough time to strenghten first to make it unfair for your opponent. In the end white won on a lucky ko.

The main mistakes and chances to simplify the game are numbered (you can shift-click them to go to the position and then shift-click E5 to go to this comment):
1) White played B13 after a psychological blow and tenukying it would be the resistance that would make him lose quickly, even if the D12 stones were not captured. A16 was not a threat, the groups could not be connected.
2) Hane was locally good, but it gived your opponent a chance to consolidate the upper side - exactly what white needed at the moment
3) With the P14 cut white wanted to start an immediate fight here. Resisting with a preparation move first would be perfect at the moment, making things much more complicated for white and easier for you.
4) Technical mistake, no need to atari directly, white will have to protect the cut after a few moves anyway.
5) Very slow move, just what white wanted when he played S5 and S6. Resisting by not accepting this wish and just connecting and making strenght would be perfect.
6) A small move...
7) ... followed by another move white wanted. Q6 had no real meaning except that white hoped to trickily cut black and succeeded. Again there was a nice chance to resist by letting white to cut as he wished - two living groups.
8) A chance to kill the stones in a more effective way.
9) Semeai mistake, missed a chance to destroy white eye shape at T3.
10) Sometimes it is better to create ko instead of giving your opponent a big eye.

I hope you enjoyed my opinions on the game and good luck in your games :-)]
