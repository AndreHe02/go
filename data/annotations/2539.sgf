C[Hi there

My name is Johan Meijerink (nickname Mokoji) I am around 5k* and I played this game vs Zartole 1k*
I've been playing Go for 9 months now, and I try to improve every game, but I can't do that alone so that's why I am asking your help to review this game and to point out the biggest mistakes made by myself.
Please don't let my opening scare you, I happen to like 5-5 :)
Anyways, have fun reviewing this game as much as I played it, thank you!

greets Johan

Christian: Wow, 5k* in 9 month, that's pretty fast!
I don't know much about 5-5, so don't expect helpful comments on Joseki from me :-)]
;B[oo];W[dd];B[cp];W[ip]C[Christian: This seems to be an advantage of 5-5: The opponent thinks he has to do something special (instead of playing in the free corner). 
BTW: I found some games of Yamashita Keigo featuring 5-5 in "Go Games on Disc". Maybe you can find some study material at www.gobase.org.]
;B[pe];W[qo]C[Christian: This is not a point where I would invade the corner.]
;B[qp]
(;W[rp]C[Christian: I don't know any 5-5 Joseki, but this looks too submissive and does not use J4. I would like to play Q4, but this may be an overplay ...]
;B[qq];W[po];B[op];W[pm];B[kq];W[eq];B[dm];W[iq];B[fp]TR[dm]
SQ[cp][dp][ep][fp]C[Christian: This and the subsequent moves are very bad! Your stone at D7 is much too close to the wall you are building. If you want to settle the situation, you should take the corner instead by playing D2 or D3.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[dq];B[dp];W[cq]TR[dm]C[Christian: Look at D7 now!]
;B[qh];W[on];B[mo]C[perhaps this move is one step too high, and better to place at N4, as you will notice in white's next move]
;W[lp]C[I had no direct answer on this move.. so I decided to play somewhere else

Christian: That was a good decision. M4 is big, but it is not urgent - I think white played it too early. C9 would have been better.]
;B[fc];W[ck];B[dk]C[Christian: I think you know that this is a defensive move. This shows that something went wrong here earlier - a single stone attacks 5 stones of yours and you feel a need to defend them ...]
;W[dj];B[cl];W[ek];B[dl];W[cj];B[cf]C[Christian: This is a kind of move white makes in a handicap game - you get a good result, so you are stronger than the result in the lower left suggests.]
;W[fd];B[cc];W[cd];B[ed]C[Christian: This is an overplay.];W[ee]
;B[ec]
(;W[fe];B[ei]C[Christian: This is a well-timed kikashi.];W[ej]
;B[de];W[dc];B[ef]TR[cj][dj][ej][ck][ek]SQ[de][cf][ef][ei]C[any comments about this ? I think I was very lucky to get this result, it seems good for black, cutting white into 2/3 groups, but black's groups aren't "that" safe either

Christian: I agree to all of your points :-)
Here you managed to let your stones work together while has no eye shape at all.]

(;W[bd];B[gc];W[ff];B[eg];W[hd];B[hc];W[id]
(;B[gd]C[Christian: Why do you push in if yo can't cut? The aji of the shicho remains either way, but if you don't push in, you have one more liberty. Just play at K17 here.]
;W[ge];B[jb]C[Christian: Now you can't play at K17, which is a huge loss!]
;W[gh];B[fh]C[Christian: such a "bump" only strengthens white - he should actually play at H11 and shut you in. Is there a reason you don't want to play F11 instead?]

(;W[gg]C[Christian: This is too mild. See the variation how white should have faught back. Now White gets into trouble.]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[gj];W[gk]C[Christian: This is a bad move, but white has to try something.]
;B[hj];W[hl];B[hh]C[Christian: You found a nice tesuji, but by sacrifycing two stones white gets a result which is not that bad.]
;W[ii];B[hg]
(;W[ig];B[fg];W[hf];B[gf];W[gg];B[ih]C[Christian: This push-in actually helps white. Just playing J9 would have been better. Later on, you might want to attack by peeping at K14 instead.]

;W[kf]
(;B[bb]C[and this.. wasn't as good as I hoped it to be.. :) quite a mistake
Christian: Yes, just playing D18 in sente would have been better.]
;W[cb];B[db];W[bc]C[Christian: You should still play E18 with sente. This is very big, especially since white E18 is also sente!! If you play E18 now, B18 would have been not that bad - your tenuki here was the mistake. Up to now, the game is still close. The worst mistakes were in yose!]
;B[nk];W[eb];B[ib];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[mc];W[kc];B[kb];W[mf]
;B[qd];W[oc];B[pd];W[rb];B[nb];W[ob];B[rc];W[qb]C[Christian: Why don't you play S16 with sente? This move is also very big. Maybe you wanted to leave it as a ko threat or you thought that it would be aji-keshi - but don't forget that Go is a competition for territory, not aji!]
;B[rn]C[Christian: This is a good move, and if you played S16 before, you might have won the game.]
;W[ro];B[nq];W[rm];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[oj];W[ql];B[rk]
;W[nl];B[mk];W[mm];B[bq]C[Christian: This move is big, but not sente. Here you should definitely have played at S16!]
;W[br];B[bp];W[lq];B[ar]C[Christian: This move will at some time be sente, while N2 is the prototype of a double-sente (a sente for both sides). Don't miss them!!! I'm not a yose freak myself, but I think N2 is consired to be worth about 10 points in sente. This would mean by playing N2, S6 and A2 (in this order) you might still have won the game!]

C[and this is it..
a 16.5 moku loss..
my yose technique could use a huge upgrade, aswell my opening and midgame.. I have no idea what my strong points/weak points are, perhaps you could help me making that clear :)

Christian: You name it. I think you lost this game in yose - I'm impressed you played that well against a 1k* after playing go for only 9 month. And you are lucky: Yose is not that hard to learn (compared to opening and middle game). Just don't forget the big points, especially if they are sente or even sente for both sides.]
