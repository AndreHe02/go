C[I played white with 0.5 komi against a 10k* NNGS player.  In this game, I felt OK about the late middle-game (after black attacked the right side), but I felt like I was playing catch-up in the opening..

Later on, I made a good sized moyo on the right-hand side, but I don't feel like I made the most out of it.

Dave Sigaty (hereafter "ds" - forfun on NNGS) - Below are various comments and variations.  You will note that I let my mouse do a lot of my talking.  Good luck, I hope you enjoy it.  More or less you should trust what I say but you should check the variations and think through them yourself.  Two reasons for this:
1. I am sure there are mistakes in some of them (there always are in my games so why not here!).
2. You will learn and remember a lot more if you do not trust my variations too much - no live opponent has tested them for me.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[cd];W[pp]C[I wanted to play this on Q3, but it seemed weak.. should I have mirrored on R4 if I were to play a 3-4, or was Q3 OK?   ds - The question isn't so much what play is best or whether a particular one is OK or not.  Rather, why did you want to play it?  If you have an idea that includes plans for how to follow-up on black's possible responses, go ahead and try it.  See what happens and learn from it.  You could ask a pro what is the best play here, but you won't be able to justify the answer yourself because you won't be able to continue with best play - neither can I.  My advice is - always have a plan, then just try it.]

(;B[ck]C[ds - Here black has a plan - to build a structure on the left.  However, this let's white take the initiative.  Usual would be E17 or O17.  With white having played nirensei on the right, letting white play first across the top can't be good.]
;W[ed];B[dg]C[ds - Black follows his plan to build a structure on the left but white has the opportunity to play on a larger scale.]

(;W[jc]C[ds - This looks loose to me, allowing black to invade.  See the variation.]
;B[gc]
(;W[cc]C[Is this tesuji?  In Direction of Play, the author says that a move which looks similar to this is a "group settling tesuji that everybody knows".  Except me.. this worked out for me, but I'd like to know if it is really a good move after all.

ds - Whether or not the play itself is good or not, the idea behind it is wrong here.  White doesn't need a "group settling tesuji" here.  Rather the issue is how to deal with a black invasion of white's area.]
;B[dc];W[dd];B[ec];W[ce];B[bd]
(;W[be];B[bc];W[df];B[fd]C[ds - This is too nice a play for black to get.  Look at the situation now.  White staked out the top but now black has taken the corner in a big way.  White's stone at K17 is misplaced - there is too much space between it and the stone at Q16.  Black's stone at C9 has begun to look good.  It is well placed to pressure white's stones.  White has been outplayed here.]
;W[cg]
(;B[eg]C[ds - A bit slack for black.]
(;W[ci]C[ds - See the variation, white leaves black some chances this way.]
;B[bj];W[bi]
(;B[cn]C[ds - This let's white off too easy.  Black should keep white surrounded and force a small life on the side]
;W[cq]C[If I were black, I would have responded to this at D3 instead of D4, and then used the wall to build strength facing the empty bottom side and the Q4 stone.  Is this a correct assesment of the situation?

ds - As can been seen in the other variations around here, the situation of the left side is unsettled.  Therefore this invasion is played too early.  Black should indeed block at D3. Playing C3 instead makes C6 earlier look strange.]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er]
(;B[bq]C[ds - Makes C6 pointless.  Black should continue as usual - see variation.]

C[ds - Does this work?]
(;W[mq]C[I didn't know what sort of extension to make to expand the framework I was building on the right.  N4 seemed better for influence along the side, but I was afriad of black slipping underneath.  So I played this move without too much direction..

ds - On the assumption that the ladder works (and that black is thick) this is the right extension.  Even one space more invites an invasion, if not now then later.]
;B[kq]C[ds - This is the wrong direction - it is small at this point.  Black should invade at the top, I think.]

;W[mc]C[Should I have played at P10 instead of here?  P10 had been my goal for about a dozen moves, but I didn't see a good time to get it.  I was worried about the two white stones along K, and I thought black would end in gote by playing S16, so I made this extension instead of playing P10.

ds - No, this extension is better.  But again it depends on what you are going to do with it.  The real point comes soon when black plays into your moyo.]
;B[oj]
(;W[ph]C[..trying to drive black toward the bottom, so I could attack and break up his potential on the left side at the same time..]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[om];W[rc]C[This tenuki was probably a mistake, since I lost sente, but I thought that my upper-side wall was looking fairly weak, and Q12 was trying to make territory with it.

ds - The left side wall has been reinforced by Q12 and you have S16 as your sente any time you want it.  If Q6 instead black is heavy with no prospect for eyes.  Black will have to run all the way to the left, with white attacking in order to escape.]

;B[pi];W[qh];B[qi];W[ri];B[ng];W[of];B[nh]C[I got pretty squished here, but I didn't see a better way to play it..]

(;W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk];B[nf];W[ne]C[Should I have ignored O14 and played Q10 instead?

ds - Well, Q10 is a pretty pointless play (at least very small) at this time.  The reason is that capturing at P11 is gote.  Black can easily escape while you are busy.]
;B[ok];W[nn];B[on];W[ko];B[lp]C[ds - This play doesn't do anything but strengthen white.  Black needs to connect along the bottom (assuming that black and white agree that the upper right corned isn't dead :-).  If black connected at N2, it looks like the bottom will be worth nearly 20 points.  Since white's right side is only worth about 30, it looks like black would have an easy win.  The success of the suppression of white's right side has left black in the driver's seat.]
;W[lo];B[hm];W[mr];B[ps];W[gr];B[fp];W[fs];B[hr];W[io];B[ho]
;W[iq]C[ds - Both players misunderstand the bottom left corner status.  Black should capture at G1.  This is sente against the corner because the next capture at E1 starts a ko to destroy white's eye.  After capturing at G1 black can jump to K1 saving the stones.]
;B[ir];W[jq];B[jr]
(;W[kr]C[ds - The idea was good, but realize that here white didn't actually need to throw in a stone.]
;B[lr];W[lq];B[ks];W[kp];B[kr];W[gs];B[hq]
(;W[cj]C[ds - At some point white should take the time to hane at O1 which is virtually sente against the lower right corner and prevents the connection later.  See variation.]
;B[dk]C[ds - Black should just connect at B9.  If white D9, black can just cut at D10.  White's left side group is too weak for white to resist strongly.  When black leaves behind the cut at B9 white's group is suddenly not weak any more.]
;W[ei];B[ee]C[ds - As seen in the earlier variations, E14 is the right shape here.]
