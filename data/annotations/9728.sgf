C[N: Hi I play as Numsgil on KGS (around 1k-1d). I'll prefix my comments with N: like this.



gogol [11k\]: hi
Eysenck [11k?\]: hi!


Thanks for reviewing my game. I hope you will find it interesting.
I'm probably around 11kyu (used to be 10, but haven't played in a while).
I will comment the game.
Best,

;B[qo];W[ro];B[qn]MA[rn]C[N: Because there aren't any other pressing moves, whit should continue pushing here at X I think.  Why?  Because if black plays there, he can seal white in the corner in sente.  Being sealed in the corner is so bad white usually doesn't mind spending a move pushing along the second line just to prevent it.]
;W[jp];B[mq]MA[rn]C[N: As I mention, playing at X is sente for black (white will have to connect or form a hanging connection to be sure of life) so black should do so now.]

(;W[mp]C[This move looks bad now.
Maybe M3?

N: Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.  Black is strong in the area, so even tenuki is reasonably.  Really no one should be playing here for a while when there are still corner approach moves to make elsewhere.  "Don't play near thickness" and all that.]
;B[np];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr]
(;B[mo]C[N: See variation.  Black can sacrifice a little to make a bigger wall.]
;W[lp]MA[jp]C[N: Not great for white, since the X stone is too close to the wall he's made.  White shouldn't have played in the area just yet in the first place.]
;B[rn];W[sp];B[sr];W[rr]C[I was in doubt about to to respond to bT2 and came up with this.]
;B[sn];W[sq];B[qf]MA[jd]C[N: This is IMO too small.  Black should have expanded his moyo with a play around X, since he's built up such a big wall on the bottom.]
;W[nd]MA[ld][kd]C[N: First really big mistake by white.  Don't play near thickness.  If black's smart, he's going to pincer around X and chase white's group downward, forming lots of impressive central facing thickness while white has to run for a while just to survive.]
;B[oc]C[N: Black is not smart :)  This is just helping white.  White could even tenuki.]
;W[nc];B[eq]MA[nf][of]CR[jc][ic][id][jd][kc][kd]C[N: Having kicked, Black should either cap at X or pincer around circle.  Letting white play around circle to create a base would be too terrible to allow.]
;W[gq]MA[jp]CR[eo][ep]C[N: White's bottom formation is too tight.  The X stone is almost not doing anything.  I don't know what to do instead, though.  Maybe play around circle?]
;B[eo];W[cn];B[cr];W[dl];B[cf];W[cd]MA[ch][ci]C[Instead of the pincer at C12, I choose to close the corner in this way

N: This isn't as good as it might first appear.  The top is really, really open.  So trying to close it off for territory isn't that compelling.  And this doesn't put much pression on the black stone, because it can make a base along the side still.  A pincer around X would be waaaaaay better, because it does two things quite well: it closes off the side from invasion and puts pressure on teh black stone.  That sort of two-for-one move is what you should look for, especially in the opening.]
;B[ci];W[cj]MA[dl]CR[ck][ef]TR[jc][jd]C[This contact move was bad.
But I'm not sure what is best.

N: Yes, contact move is bad here (contact moves make both sides stronger.  White is penty strong already).  First, consider why you're contacting.  Because black is threatening to scoop out the side from under white.  Because the X stone is high, which mean the formation was unfinished.  So back to the previous move, a pincer would have been better.

Now that we're in this position, if I had to play locally, I'd play either of circle.  The one on the side aims to stabilize the white group therewhile preventing black's from being totally safe.  The cap along the top would aim to provide some pressure while growing the top for points.  But they're both pretty lame moves honestly.

But honestly, I think something like triangle would be much smarter.  It grows the top and protects those two white stones that are heavy.]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[bl];B[di];W[bh];B[bi]
(;W[bf]C[Here I failed to connect. Was there a way?

N: See my variation for the usual sneaky high handicap tesuji that usually makes black angry :)  That said, now isn't the time, because you're not going to get to do all this in sente.  Take the move along the top I mentioned.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[ae];W[ad];B[bg];W[ce]C[N: This is sort of a thank-you move.  It just destroys aji white might be able to use later, and what is white's benefit?  -1 liberty on that group.  Again, take sente and do something along the top.]
;B[af];W[ah]C[N: If you don't see a clear way to kill, leave well enough alone and come back to the position later.  Worst case there is a way to kill it you miss, and black ends up burning a move at some point to protect himself.  As it is, if you can't kill the group, black gets free points.  Clearly a bad trade for you.]
;B[df];W[gn]C[N: I'd still say the top is bigger.  This puts some amount of pressure on black while growing the bottom, so it's all that bad, though.]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[bq];W[bp];B[cq];W[fq];B[er];W[ds]C[I was hoping to kill black's group on the lower left, but maybe already at this point it was not possible.

N: Again, don't try poking at black's groups if you don't see a way to kill it.  At least not this early in the game.  You can always come back to the position later if black hasn't added a move.

Honestly I don't think there's a way to kill black.  Not until you've started eliminating liberties at least.]
;B[fs];W[aq];B[ar];W[gc]C[N: The stones on the right need more help.]
;B[ic];W[kc]C[N: This feels cramped, right?];B[hd];W[gd];B[jd]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[nb];B[kd];W[ld];B[hb];W[gb];B[hc];W[of]C[I couldn't come up with a better move at this point, but probably there is.

N: This isn't bad; you're on the boundary of black's moyo and flattening it.  If black got to go here, imagine the difference.]
;B[ph];W[od];B[pc];W[pa]TR[nh][kn]C[N: It's way to early to be doing these sorts of first line moves.  Why does black care?  Worst case he loses some points in the corner.  But he can make moves like triangles to grow his moyo, and it'd be worth way more points.]
;B[qa];W[oa];B[rb];W[le]C[Black looks solid on the right side, and I'm concern that it can grow by expanding from the group on the lower right.

N: White's group on top is pretty okay even without this move.  Spend it flattening black's moyo intead.]
;B[ie];W[nk]TR[oh][qk][pj]C[This was a wild attempt.

N: If you're going to invade, consider attaching to stones.  It strengthens both sides, but black is plenty strong already.  Remember these are probing moves, so nothing has to come of them.  BUt they might help you.]
;B[pl];W[om]TR[pk][ol][nm]C[N: This stone can be cut (as you found out).  It could be used as a sacrifice, but I don't see a way to do that well.  ANy of the triangle moves would be better.]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[nn];W[lo];B[ge];W[fe];B[gf];W[gj]
TR[ll]C[N: I would prefer finishing your wall on the right with triangle, so you can actuall y get points on the side.  This isn't bad, but it's harder to make points over here.]
;B[ih]C[I think that usually I have trouble to aproach to the center.]
;W[ff]TR[ll]C[N: This is breaking in to black's tiny center territory when you still have a big hole in your own.  Again, triangle calls out to me :)]
;B[ln];W[kn]TR[mn]C[N: I'd play at triangle and fight, but I'm crazy like that.]
;B[lm];W[km];B[ll];W[gg]TR[kl]C[N: I'd continue pushing here, because if black ignores you, you have a bunch of forcing moves.]
;B[hg];W[pe];B[qe];W[pj]C[N: THis is hard now, because you don't have any groups you can run towards easily.]

;B[jb];W[kb];B[gh];W[fg]MA[fo]C[Maybe I could have tenuki here?

N: Yeah I think so.  Usually letting your oponent get a ponuki is realyl really bad, but black is so strong around here anyway it might not matter.  Maybe X instead.]
