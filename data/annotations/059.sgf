(;W[nq]C[White doesn't want black to build a san-ren-sei (if black adds a stone on K4), but
he doesn't really have the choice.  
Now black can play a pincer, e.g. on K3 (see variation) and white will be in trouble.

Other possibilities for white are shown in the variations.

(but I think the best thing for white is to let black play the san-ren-sei and have
a moyo game, in which each players looks for the biggest moyo possible)]

(;B[pn]C[A black pincer would have been better now (see previous comments and variations)]
;W[fq]
(;B[hq]C[Maybe it's a good idea to let white take the lower side as is shown in the
variation.
This move serves white purpose cause, as will be seen, this stone will come  under severe attack.]
;W[fo]
(;B[ho]C[This is not joseki, and will leave black with a weak group in the center, and
a very little corner (as will be seen later)];W[pr]
(;B[qq];W[kq]C[This points out the weakness of the black position I talked in the previous
variation.
This move is very strong here, cause it settles white while attacking Black]
;B[dn]C[This move is strange : as long as white will have no trouble securing his two

stones, it may have been better to play on K2 before (K2 is nearly sente, cause
it threatens white's lower right group) and only later come back to D6.]
;W[dr]C[Securing white group, and thus attacking the two lone black stones on the lower side
(see previous comment)];B[cq];W[gn]C[This move is of course a strong attack to the black stones.
But I think it's more important to play on the upper side now.
For example a white stone in the upper left would make a big difference,
as well as a shimari in the upper right (on P 17 for example)]
(;B[jo]C[This is bad shape (in my mind). To escape in the center, it is correct to  play on J6, but the 'shape' move here is in the variation.]
;W[ip]C[This strikes at black's vital point, and such a move usually even cuts
black in two, which would be awful here ...];B[hp];W[io];B[in];W[jp];B[hn]
;W[ko]C[This move looks slow to me, cause it doesn't really destroy black's influence
in the center.
Plays in the upper (left or right) corners are much more important now]

(;B[dd]C[Good move !

Maybe it would have been better to switch one line to the left (so that there is  
a little less room for a white invasion in the left side), but switching it to  the left also has a drawback : the upper side is very wide......]
;W[gr]C[White is not really in trouble here, so it's only an endgame move.
Black should make a shimari in the upper right];B[gm];W[fm];B[gl]C[Black has gone further in the center, but still doesn't have eye shape, and now
the left side is very weak, due to the possible invasion (by white) at D8]
;W[ql]
(;B[qm]C[If I were to give one advice concerning the whole game, surely it would be :
Never play this move again !

This move is way too passive ...  Moreover, in this position, black's corner is still open to invasion at S2
(even if a direct invasion doesn't work for the moment)

In answer to such a play, black has two possibilities :
*) escape in the center or
*) make a small like in the corner by playing R2 (leaving it open at R7
   is definitely better than at S2)];W[od]C[White finally got to make a shimari.....

The only white problem may be his stone on R8.... (vulnerable to attack)
I think white should plan on sacrificing it to build a huge moyo in the  upper right....]
;B[lc]C[Maybe the wrong direction ?  R10 still looks interesting and keeps white from taking the left side
(but leaves the upper side open)];W[fc];B[hc]C[This stone shoud be on J17 (one line to the right) cause there is a very
weak point for black now : K17 (and white will play there later in the game)

Playing on J17 gives black a very good position on the upper side
(thus white should have approached the corner from the other side)];W[fe]
;B[df];W[ch];B[ck];W[ce]
(;B[cd]C[(See variation)
Now black will get cut, and this is a disaster.];W[de];B[ee];W[ed];B[ef]
;W[cf];B[ec]C[This move only strengthen white, and will lead to a very bad result on the
upper side (as will be seen in the game)
To make the corner alive, i think C2 now is enough (at least I didn't see any
real possibility for white to kill it)];W[fd];B[eb];W[fb];B[cb]C[Black finally gets to play C2 anyway, but White has a wonderful wall on the outside.
(which he will use with the next move)
(see previous comments)];W[jc]C[I think this move is clear enough now with the previous comments.]
;B[he];W[gf];B[jd]C[Okay with this move... It looks good to me in this position]
;W[id];B[ie];W[kd];B[je];W[kc];B[ic];W[ke];B[ig]C[Though the apparent positive result (he's out in the center and has eye potential),  black can't really be satisfied with what happened on the upper side.


To avoid such a position, a move such as J17 instead of H17 when white attacked the
corner would have surely been enough.


(Cause there is no obvious way black can capture the whole F18 group, which will escape
in the center)];W[gh];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[fj];W[hi];B[ff];W[ge];B
[hh]C[Black should start to worry about his eyes.....
H16 is nearly forced here (instead of this stone on H12)];W[fi];B[fh];W
[hg];B[gi];W[ih]C[After this "obvious" sequence, white is in the center and black group has lots

of problems (white can completely destroy the eye on J16, as will be done in the  game) and needs to run in the center too.]
;B[hf]C[This is an error (see previous comment and next white move)];W[jg]
C[Now black can't escape in the center anylonger....];B[gb]
(;W[ea]C[This move is not the best one locally (in my mind)

If white plays on F19, black is in great trouble with his group (see variation)
and his corner is full of weaknesses (see other variation)];B[da];W[fa]
;B[jb];W[kb];B[ia];W[hb]C[There is a trick there (see variations after)]

(;B[ha]C[After this move, white seems to be able to kill the corner again....]

(;W[bd]
(;B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]C[Now there is a ko threat against the corner, starting with D18]
;W[gj]C[White starts a fight there, which will result in a big ko fight.....]

(;B[ek];W[dk];B[dl];W[el];B[em];W[ej];B[fl];W[fi];B[fn];W[fk];B[hr];W[cr]

(;B[fj]C[I think black should sacrifice his E14 group and focus on the attack of the white
group on C2 et al.... (looks weak) and the defense of the lower right side

I think it's bigger];W[bq];B[gi];W[gc]C[This is *not* a ko threat

In fact, it kills black unconditionnally (see one of the variations I put below)

So, for the moment, black would do as well to ignore this and connect the ko.]
;B[ga];W[fi];B[gd]C[Now, since white gives him a chance, black should forget the ko and save this
group (capturing the white stone just does the job)];W[hd];B[gd];W[hd];B
[gi];W[ab];B[ba]C[and there is still a ko threat against the corner....
(thus the use of the variation i showed sooner)];W[fi];B[cg];W[bg];B[gi]
;W[dg];B[fi]C[Black finally wins the ko but :

*) he lost his upper side group (which he had an apportunity to save)


*) white could have played the ko on longer, since he has *lots* of ko threats
   (against the upper left corner, lower left side, and even lower right)]
;W[cj];B[bp];W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[br]C[Endgame move.  (see variations)];B[qk]C[This looks like a tesuji, but there are a few points to consider :


*) black is way behind on the board, so if he wants to play on, he should take maximal     risks and invade deep in white's moyo (at K10 for example)


*) correct conclusion after first point is that black could (should ?) already resign


*) this, because now white only needs to play very solid moves and black won't be     able to catch up.]
;W[qi];B[lb];W[ka];B[ob];W[pb];B[pc];W[qc];B[qb];W[pd];B[nb];W[pj]C[White now builds a huge moyo in the area (with this move and the following)]

[md];B[kf];W[jf];B[lf]C[This is hopeless....

Black has no way to make a live group there (unless white blunders of course)  cause white is quite strong in the area.


The following fight shows a good and classical "encircling" technique by white,

any further comment];W[me];B[mf];W[nf];B[lh];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj];B[kg];W[jh]

(;W[bk]C[Looks interesting (locally) cause if black wants to take the corner, he will lose
the side.


Yet, both of these moves should be kept for the endgame, and white should think
about enlarging his upper-right moyo (see variation 2)])
(;W[pj]C[After such a move, the game is over and black can resign.
Though maybe it's not the best place to put this stone ?]))
(;B[br];W[fj];B[fp]C[Now, black has some (possibly very good, if he manages to kill all the white group)
compensation for his sacrificed group]))
(;B[fk]C[This solid connection looks interesting to avoid the ensuing ko, but black is in
trouble anyway cause he will lack eye space...];W[ek]C[Now black has nearly no way to connect to the left and will have a hard time  making the center group alive]
;B[jl]C[But black can try to make one eye in the center starting with this move,
and may find some eye place on the edge too.....

So maybe it's ok for black to avoid the ko, but it's impossible for my mind to
browse through all the variations]))

sequence which leaves less ko threats at the end ....];W[dc];B[cc];W[db]

around J18 and vice-versa)])

here is what may happen if black manages to live with his H17 group or ignores threats
to the corner)];W[ea];B[da];W[dc];B[db];W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb];W[cg]C[And black is confined in a 3 or 4 points corner.]

There is no need to think about where white will play later on, just  put a stone there...
There is a saying that : "even a moron connects against a peep"]))
(;B[qi]C[Now white has trouble to handle this stone, which will settle easily.   If white attacks from the upper, white stone on R8 will be very weak, and if
white chooses to attack from the lower, black will settle easily, weakening
the corner, and white is overconcentrated.]
(;W[qg];B[pk])
(;W[qj];B[pi];W[ok];B[qf]C[After this sequence, black's lower corner looks really weak, but so
is white's upper right, so i think it's fair]))
(;B[qr]C[This move is much better than what was played in the game, cause it puts
pressure on white side.
Imagine White plays S6 now to capture black corner :  here is one possibility.....]
;W[rn];B[or];W[oq];B[pq];W[nr];B[ps]C[And, though White didn't lose sente, black corner is completely alive, and
is (by far) not shut in...

Now white strongly needs to play a move to strenghten the right side, leaving
the upper side all open for a black extension...

The game looks close to me at this stage (even with the weak black group)
(but after white R8, i think a play around R11 is best for black)]))
(;B[cd]

such a passive way (i.e. white can also attack the upper left as in variation)]

to shut black in.];W[hn];B[jn];W[hn]))
(;B[lq]C[It is surely better to let white get away with the corner now, while securing
the center group.

When there is no black stone on the lower side, R3 (played in the game) is ok

(it is joseki), and it is even a strong move if there is a black stone on K4  or around (cause white lacks room to extend on the side)]

(;B[dn]C[This is the beginning of the local joseki.

White can slide in the corner at D2 (if he doesn't want to fight), but there are,

roughly speaking, two ways for white to handle the position, which are shown in the  variations.]

(;W[ho];B[eq];W[fr];B[jq];W[fm]C[End of first joseki here. Both white and black groups are weak, so this will
be a "fair" fight.

Note that the lower left corner is still opened to an invasion at the san-san (C3)]

on O3 looks very weak now (it is black turn)])))
(;B[dn];W[jp];B[cc]C[I think black can be happy with this position : if white wants to take one
of the lower corners, he will have to leave sente, whereas a black move at
Q2 or D2, while securing a very large corner is sente if white wants to  keep the side.   Moreover, white's upper right corner is also subject to a kakari (approach  by black)]
;W[oc];B[pr]C[If White doesn't answer this move, Black will play on m3, destroying
the lower side (black can connect either under the white stone, or  make an escape in the center]
)
(;B[jq]C[If black wants to play a pincer attack now, it should be played here (or very near,  
e.g. on K4) cause this stone (on K3 or K4) also puts pressure on white stone on O3


(In the game, black played on H3, and later white has been able to expand his lower-right
stone at L3 which would be impossible now)]))

This is a good result for black]))
(;W[jq]C[White can also try to invade the lower side here, but it leads to
a sequence similar to what is shown now.


If white really wants to attack on the lower side, maybe the best idea for him is

to go on the left corner, for example on F3 (cause the upper left corner is empty
for the moment and white doesn't risk to see one of his stones feel *alone* on
a corner)];B[dd];W[cj]C[THis move is "forced" cause otherwise black will make a san-ren-sei on the left side.]
;B[oc]C[Black has made the first move in 3 corners, and white played two moves on the sides.

In the beginning, corners are much more important than sides, so black is happy with this.]
