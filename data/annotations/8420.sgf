C[forfun (hereafter ff) - First of all thanks for providing an interesting game to put on the board and analyze. I had an enjoyable time preparing the review. Both players showed lots of fighting spirit. If there is one single piece of advice that I would give to Black it would be, "Finish what you start!" Many times during the game Black played a few moves in an area and then played away. These means giving you opponent many opportunities to exploit. To become stronger at Go we all have to learn to play the reality on the board. We are all weaker to the extent that we are willing to leave things unfinished and just "hope for the best" when fighting continues in the future.]

(;B[dl]C[ff - See the variation for an alternative...];W[cp]
(;B[dm]C[ff - This is a mistake in direction. Why? Because these stones can not accomplish much toward the right after White has played the F4 stone. Joseki is to play down at C8 to build strength up the left side, see the variation.]
;W[bo];B[cn]C[ff - Pretty pointless. Black would do better here by just playing C8 instead.]
;W[bn]C[Q: I feel like I came out way worse in this corner.  Should I have done something differently?

ff - See earlier comments. You are correct that Black is dissatisfied. The Black stones achieve little while White's corner is big.]
;B[oc]
(;W[qj];B[qh];W[qn]
(;B[nq]C[Q: In retrospect, this was probably too defensive, but the kick felt like it would help W out.  Was there a better response?

ff - See the variation.];W[rp]
(;B[qq]C[ff - May not be the best here. See the variation...]
;W[pl]C[ff - Compare the variation on White 16. White's position is a little bigger and can not be flattened out nor easily invaded. However, White has used four stones instead of three and Black has sente.]
(;B[cl]C[ff - Black plays away from the lower right and pays the price when White immediately plays M3. Black would have been better off to extend on the lower side in order to prevent White from getting full value from the F4 stone. See the variation...

Locally Black should probably cut at B7 instead. Here if White ever comes back and connects at B7, Black will still be open at the side. See the second variation...]
;W[lq]
(;B[jq]C[Q: Too ambitious?  Maybe a shoulder hit or something else would have been better?

ff - White' sM3 directly threatens the life of the lower right group. Black has to defend first, and worry about the bottom side later. See the variation...]
;W[kp];B[gq];W[fq];B[fr];W[er]
(;B[hr]C[ff - This is a fundamentally flawed idea that takes a nice, light group and makes it a heavy burden. G3 and F2 are good as forcing moves, but they should be understood as forcing moves. Now Black should want to move out quickly. See the variation...]
;W[fs];B[gp]C[ff - Forcing a response where White wants to play anyway!]
;W[fo]C[ff - Ouch! White starts to hurt the left-side stones...]
;B[kr]C[ff - A very damaging play for the lower right.];W[lr]
;B[jd]C[ff - Black has two weak groups at the bottom, neither of which are alive. So he turns to the top. This can not be done.

In addition, this is not the right direction. The left side Black stones have been weakened by White F5. Looking just at the upper left, Black should play C14.]
;W[rq]C[ff - White sets out to lock up about fifty points in the lower right.]
;B[rr];W[pr]C[Q: I feel like I really botched this corner.  How could I have defended better?

ff - See previous comments.];B[qr];W[oq];B[op];W[nr];B[fc]C[ff - Black plays away again. Basically Black has just used up three large ko threats in the lower right for no reason.

Again this should be C14. Black just invites White to play against the left-side Black stones.]
;W[cf];B[db]C[ff - See previous comment.]
(;W[ld]C[ff - Now White returns the favor. Up to here White was looking like a sandbagger masquerading as a kyu player. :-) See the variation...]
(;B[kc];W[cc];B[ch]C[ff - Good choice!];W[lg]C[ff - With this jump, most of the pressure is off the White stones.]
;B[oh]
(;W[lc]C[ff - See the variation...];B[om]C[ff - Good idea. Black needs to do something with these stones in order to stay in the game.]
;W[ol]
(;B[nm]C[ff - Is this heavy? See the variation...];W[mk]
(;B[fe]C[ff - Bad idea :-) It is not time to leave the bottom alone.]
;W[cb];B[eb]C[ff - Maybe a ten-point gote play?];W[km]C[ff - Fundamental bad shape, begging Black to play at M8. If White had played M7, Black looks dead?]
;B[ll]C[ff - Black answers the call! :-)];W[ml];B[pn];W[qo]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[mo]C[ff - A good choice for trying to make eyes. But is it too ambitious here?]
(;W[ln]C[ff - This looks like it assures Black of life. The question is what about T2? See the variation...]
;B[sr]
(;W[no];B[mp];W[hn];B[ip]C[ff - Good, the key point for eyeshape.]
;W[gr]
(;B[hs]C[ff - Dangerous? Should this be at J2 to be sure of living? See the variation on White's next play...]

;W[of];B[ph];W[nh]C[Q: Obviously my shape here is awful.  Was there some way I could have avoided it?

ff - Shape is only a general guide. Black has successfully connected along the side after playing away in order to gain the upper hand in the center. He also has sente to play against the upper left. Black should be very happy with this result.]

(;B[kq]C[ff - This would make Black fully safe and limit what White can do with the lower left. However, Black does have the feeling of being overconcentrated. Black would rather not have played the R3 stone since together R3 and L3 create an over-concentrated shape. So in the end, Black is dissatisfied after choosing O3. He would have been happier to have invaded at R8 instead, or to have played L3 directly instead of R3.]

(;B[kq]C[ff - Black should definitely have considered this.]

The basic shape formed by three stones on O3, Q4, and R3 is overconcentrated. That is why White will so often rush to play S4 when Black answers an approach move with O3. Black should always consider whether answering S4 with R3 is worth it or not. Here it probably is not!]
