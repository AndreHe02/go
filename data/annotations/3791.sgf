C[Dear Reviewer, this game was played between erro and myself on KGS. I played black. I have added some questions, where I am interested in special aspects of the game.

But any comments you have for me would be greatly appreciated. Would you be so kind and review the game to find out my mistakes, please? Any idea which topic of Go I should especially train would be helpful. Thanks. Yanshou]

(;W[dr]C[Yanshou: This move seems to secure the corner. I am interested in ways to attack from inside.

**************************************
Dave: This is not a typical reaction to the F3 play, though it seems playable. White is trying to build a moyo with the high chinese opening and so should hit on top at F4 perhaps. See Variations.

It is too early to attack inside. Even if you live, it will be small and the thickness white gains will be larger.

Generally speaking this formation has a weakness for a play at the c6 point. If white defends at c5, for example, the forcing moves by black can result in good thickness. The white corner is not large.

Again here this is not appropriate, as the F3 stone is close to white's thickness and needs help before invasion can be consider.]

(;B[iq]C[Dave: This is too conservative. Play on the 3rd line is for territory and D2 compromises the territory here. At least J4 or K4.

If you are worried about an attack with K4 see variation];W[lc]
C[Yanshou: I dont know how to handle this move. I decided for a pincer attack. Are there better possibilities?


********************

This is too far from the D17 stone. Its not a very effective move.

A pincer is possible, but not necessary.  Black could try and break up white's position by playing around the D17 stone.  Black could build his own moyo at M4, for example.]
;B[jc];W[oc]C[Dave: unfortunately, an extension like this is quite strong, and perhaps suggests the pincer was not a good idea.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[pa]C[Dave: Mistake by White. Black can play at O18 and destroy White's position.]

(;B[qa];W[nb];B[pf];W[gc];B[de]TR[jc]C[Yanshou: Should I´ve better moved out with K17?

*******************
Dave: I think this is better.  W''s top group is almost alive. You probably should have helped this stone instead of Q14.]
;W[cg];B[cc]TR[de]C[Yanshou: Is there a way to settle my 2-stone group at the corner?

;B[kj]C[Yanshou: I´ve red, a boxlike shape is solid base for a moyo.

*******************
Dave: This was a terrible way for black to lose. The top right corner, while it could have been saved, required a little reading. The loss of over six points on the bottom though was pure blindness. Ouch!

Generally speaking, Black must work on shape and preventing bad aji. One must always look to see what forcing moves your opponent can and (one must assume) will play against you and see what the situation is. You have good situational awareness, in that you seem to have a good sense of where you should be playing; your timing is good and end play in a given area when you should - these are good traits to have.

I think psychologically, Black got flustered when white became threatening. White's invasion into the moyo was to be expected - the key is to contain White, not kill him. Try to count a bit to see where you stand - its better than you probably think.

The game was exciting and interesting. I hope my comments were useful and I appreciate your interest in my opinions.
