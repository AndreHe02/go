C[Hi Reviewer, i'm Piter playing white in this game.
I lost 6,5 points and dont know why.
My biggest questions is 1) where i can invade 2) how to use my thickness and 3) where was wrong direction to attack or play?)
I add some variations/

Sorry for my bad English))

Thank you for your review!

Hi, I'm Josh and I will be your reviewer and I typically play on KGS as Kashomon (1k). I'll be marking my comments Josh: or J:  I will refer you often as "white" and you opponent as "black"  -- just a habit.  

In general,];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]
(;W[po]C[to prevent black chinese opening

J: It's not necessary to prevent the Chinese opening, but if you don't like playing against it, playing where you did is fine. Admittedly, pros will almost always take the corners first before approaching a corner.  Some pros like Yang Yilun believe it's completely bad to deviate but I still do it too.]

J: Agreed.];W[nc];B[pc];W[ke]C[not urgent move?

Josh: I think this is ok.];B[jd];W[kd]C[J: A side note. This is a bad exchange for black (and good for you).  Normally, these moves are made to make your opponent have less eye-potential, but here it actually prevents some nice attacks.]

(;W[qh]C[J: I think you can go farther to R13, but this isn't bad.]
;B[qf];W[qg]C[J: This doesn't get you very much (and makes black's corner stronger).  Black can tenuki to play at B8]
(;B[pf];W[kp]C[here is question)
i think, i need to play here. but m.b. c9 is better? or i need to play more deep? l3?

J: All of black's stones are low, so your potential for reduction is also low.  Moreover, now black has something to attack! (see the some of the variations).  As such, I think that playing at c9 would be better. 

I think this game is even right now, so strategically, I think there isn't much reason for invading since you have sente and there are places to play that make some points. (c9 or c10).]
(;B[io];W[hp]
(;B[hq]C[J: Ack, this is bad for black.  Black should press his attack!  You got away with too much here.  The reduction here went better than it probably should have]

(;W[nf]C[J: I think you need an extra move to defend your four white stones on the bottom or else they will come under attack]
(;B[cl];W[cr]C[J: Not as urgent as playing f4, as black can follow this move with f5]
(;B[er]C[J: small for black -- an endgame move];W[cj]C[J: doesn't seem good -- also gives something for black to attack, allowing black to use the thickness on the top side.]
