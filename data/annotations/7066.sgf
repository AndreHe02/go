TR[pq]C[CG: This would be the normal move if the marked stone had been played on 4-4. 
In pro games, almost always a kakari on either A, B or C is played. In the rare cases where white played a wariuchi, he played D.

The proverb "don't let your opponent get two shimari" is no longer strictly followed by professionals, but I think there is still some truth in it.]

;B[gn];W[fo];B[fl];W[hm];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[nq];B[de]C[CG: Up to this point I have no objections to any of blacks moves (and would prefer playing black).]
;W[ch]
(;B[fe]C[[Wrenn\] here I was confused. I thought that by jumping out, he would respond in the corner, and I could put pressure on C12. This turns out failing, and I then attack his corner badly :(

Would attaching to the corner stone be better here, as I would be more forcefully strengthening D15?

CG: Yes, attaching on 3-3 and playing a counter pincer looks better.
Another possibility might be pressing with a knight's move which looks more senteish against the corner.
But I don't think F15 is a really bad move. You cannot expect the left side to be black territory yet.]
;W[ck];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[gc]C[[Wrenn\] Because it seems like here F15 would have been better replaced with a counter pincer on C12]

(;B[bb]LB[eb:A]TR[fe]C[CG: I think with the marked stone you can even play A (see variation), but this move is good, too.]
;W[eb];B[ca];W[db];B[ic]C[CG: Good!];W[ge];B[gf];W[he];B[fd]
;W[hc]
(;B[fc]C[CG: This is overdoing things! Just play on the outside. If white has to struggle for a small life, this is good enough for black. You shouldn't try to really kill white.]
;W[fb];B[hb];W[gb];B[jb];W[ff]
(;B[ef]LB[dg:B][gg:A]C[CG: This is submissive! Playing from this directions and pushing from behind just strengthens white. Fighting spirit calls for A, and if you are afraid of this fight, you should rather play B.

This way, you can neither effectively attack the white group at the top nor the group on the left.

Maybe this is the losing move.];W[fg];B[eg];W[fh];B[eh];W[fi]
;B[ei];W[bm]C[CG: Now both white groups look secure, don't they? This is a bad result for black.]
