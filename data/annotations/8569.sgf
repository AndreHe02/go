C[Hello GTL reviewer, thanks for reviewing my game.  I felt like I was doing ok until I misread a ladder.  Later, I misread a corner capturing race and resigned, but I think the game was probably mostly lost by then anyhow.  I will be grateful for any insights you can share -- thank you!

Hmm... If white blocks at c9, this exchange seems to help white more than you. See variation for a possible continuation.]

This is a fine move given the situation.];W[ng];B[iq]C[I was not sure what's best for this move.  Any thoughts?

(;B[ho]C[I felt happy with this group, and I thought I could cut at D8.  But I misread it -- F3 kills the cut.  Considering how the capturing race went, I now think that this move sucks.  Would it be better at J6, G3, or what?

This shape does seem odd. I'd prefer something like k6. Contact moves are in order here. I'd try to attack to the l6 group to gain strength. There is still aji in the 3-3 in the bottom left.]

This was an interesting game. The biggest "mistakes" I feel are marked here.

A was somewhat slow, as you say, but moreover, it offered white the chance to just block and blocking does more to help white than the diagonal does for black. 

B, connected two living groups on the first line in what should have been gote.

C defended a weakness that wasn't worth worrying about when there were much bigger areas on the board.]
