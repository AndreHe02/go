C[Babibo :
Hi reviewer !

This game was very close till the yose where I made a misreading mistake. In fact, I ignored the threat because as you will be able to see, I feared a big ko in the upper left corner.

I want to be reviewed because I get stuck at 6k and keep losing against 5k these days. I feel like I'm bad in middle game fighting (thus I make a lot of tsume go problems) but I'm unsure. I think I play slow moves. I hope you can tell me what weaknesses I should work on to improve.

Thank you for your time !

Hello Babibo

Remember that KGS ranks are deflating (getting stronger) recently, so it's normal to stay the same rank or go backwards a bit.

I hope my comments can help you improve your game];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[kq]C[Babibo : experimenting the mini chinese]
;W[cj]
(;B[pj]C[Babibo : Is this move slow ?

It's a big point, but maybe you want to play on the top side instead?]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc];W[ne]TR[lc][dd][pd]C[Babibo : I like this joseki for black. That's why I play that pincer.

It's a bad pincer when the stone on the left is white. Even the joseki gives black a bad result]
;B[pf]
(;W[ng]C[Babibo : This is not joseki, and I hesitated a lot to play Q12. But I felt that a move at J17 would be very painful.]

(;B[qh];W[pi];B[qi]C[Babibo : Is there a better way here ?]
;W[oj];B[pk]C[Babibo : I like when my opponent makes me crawl along the 4th line. However, maybe I should have played P9 ?

No, this is good enough];W[gc]

(;B[ec];W[ed];B[pb]C[Babibo : I'm weakening my own group. This can't be good, no ?

Well here you are threatening to connect so I would assume you would defend your group with the next move]
;W[ob];B[if];W[ih]
(;B[fd]C[What are you doing here, if you want to cut, do it directly]
;W[fc];B[eb];W[gd]C[Babibo : I'm unhappy of this. Could I take advantage of a cut around here ?]
;B[gf];W[fe]LB[gf:A]C[If this was your plan, play A at the beginning]
;B[lf];W[lh];B[dr]C[Babibo : I can't stand wasting moves on a group like this. I prefer to let my opponent think.

You never had a chance because you created the weak group at the top]
