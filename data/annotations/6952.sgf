C[Hi,

I'm white. I haven't played in a long time (1 year or so), and only started again this week, I'm very rusty.

Both me and my opponent made alot of mistakes during this game, so I'm very curious to see what suggestions there may be to improve my game :)

Please bear in mind I'm a rusty 4d ^^

[EV\] This is your reviewer.  I am only a little stronger than you, so take my comments for what they are worth :)]
;B[qe];W[qp];B[do];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[dj];W[dq];B[eq];W[co]
C[[EV\] This is not joseki and looks unreasonable for W.  Ishida's joseki dictionary says the hane at E2 is the only move for W.  Did you maybe confuse this with the joseki which has the same pattern but with W to play?]
;B[dp];W[cp];B[cq];W[dn];B[bq];W[cm]C[[EV\] This result is clearly good for B.]
;B[dl]C[[EV\] Vital shape point, but I like the simple C9 even better, leaving W without eye space.]
;W[dr];B[er];W[en];B[fo];W[fn];B[go];W[bk];B[bj];W[ck];B[cj]
;W[dk];B[ej]C[[EV\] W is already fairly secure, and B could easily become overconcentrated here, so B could consider taking sente for a large play elsewhere.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[oq];B[pc];W[qj];B[qo]C[[EV\] I would take one of the many large points on the outside before invading here, but that may be just a matter of style.]
;W[po];B[qn];W[rp];B[pn];W[oo];B[ql]C[[EV\] This move seems too cramped for B.  After giving W a large corner, it is unclear he can get much from an attack on the lone W stone, which still has room for a two-space extension.]
;W[on]C[[EV\] W has already secured a large corner, so there no need to press more, simply extend to R13.  The exchange of this move for the next B move hurts the weak W stone on the side and will end up mostly wasted if B gets to extend around L3 before W.]
;B[ol];W[qf]C[[EV\] R13 would also be fine.];B[rf];W[pf];B[rg]
;W[pe];B[pd]C[After this move I regret my attachment in the first place]
;W[oj];B[ph]C[I have no idea how to handle my 3 stones now.

[EV\] They were forcing stones, so you can treat them lightly.]
;W[nl]C[[EV\] Blocking like this when you cannot prevent a break-through is usually bad, but here it seems to turn out OK.  I think just jumping out to N10 (preparing P12) would also be good.]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[nm];W[ml];B[om];W[rk]C[I guess n7 is better?

[EV\] Yes, I think a move in the center is better, N7 or M6 or simply N10.  B cannot connect underneath, and W is still too thin here to be concerned with constricting B eye space in preparation for a kill.]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[lm];W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[jn];W[jl];B[mq]C[[EV\] A little greedy.  Connecting around L5 (to defend against J6) would leave B in the lead I think.]
;W[in];B[io];W[lp]C[Don't ask :)];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[jo];B[kn]
;W[ho]C[[EV\] How about changing the order a little and playing E4 first?  But the B side is broken in any case.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[hn];W[gn];B[im];W[ep];B[hq];W[fq]C[[EV\] Nice.]
;B[fr];W[eo]C[[EV\] B still cannot play here, so this move is not absolutely needed.  Still, after the big gain in the corner, W is now in the lead.]
;B[nk];W[ok];B[mj];W[mi]C[[EV\] It looks like you will have to give up six stones this way, which is not bad since you get compensating thickness.  You could also consider attaching at P12 and fighting.  I have no idea how that fight would turn out :)]
;B[lj];W[li];B[nj];W[ni];B[kj];W[oh];B[ik];W[ki];B[jj];W[kd]
C[I was pretty confident I would win now. Then again... my judgement is really scrappy at the moment :)

[EV\] Yes, W is ahead now.  Nothing happened after this to change the course of the game, so my comments end here.]
