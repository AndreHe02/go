the usual sequence, which is a trade of corner territory for  a black moyo.]

(;W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]C[Black is getting the better of this deal in terms
of territory -- the corner is big.];W[pc];B[qd];W[ld];B[kd];W[kc];B[le]
;W[md];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb]C[good for black,  fourth-line territory on the
right and a wall on the left!];W[ke];B[jd];W[lb];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[cf]
;B[kf]C[is there any point in this? I ended up  ignoring the ladder block, losing
 this anyway, so why did I playit?

kjd: yes, both groups are settled so L14 is not worth much.];W[dj]C[Somehow, O3 seems more urgent here.   but this move makes a nice moyo.]
;B[fq]L[dn][hq]C[Instead of "a", white should consider the  pincer "b"
(see variation)]

C[would
 S6 or S10 be better?  THis seems to help W
 live.

kjd: how about s5 instead?  s5 secures the black lower
right corner better.  w will live here but in gote ...];W[rm];B[rj];W[ro]
;B[rp];W[sn]L[dh][ch][cc]C[At this point, black will play d12 ("a").  this  is the wrong point
locally.  black should play c12 ("b").  See the two variations.

Another good invasion point for black is C17.  see variation 3.]
(;B[dh]C[Wold
 something on bottom be better? would D8 or C8 be a better way to
 reduce W's territory?  This left side is what ends up winning it, so
 it would seem this is the game critical
 moment.];W[je]C[I do not understand K15.  I'd play b12 or something here,
really toast the white moyo.];B[ie];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[df]C[d14 is  bad, it encourages w to make moyo and b
gets useless influence on line d.  c12 or b12
are better.];W[cg];B[dg];W[ch];B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[dc]C[now white's territory is real.]
;B[di];W[ci];B[ej];W[dk]C[wow, black gives away  more territory..];B[nn]
C[this is a good move, except that it doesn't threaten  the white group, and black is missing f6.]
;W[ig]C[I don't understand j13.  g5 is the key point here, or
maybe even m3, though m3 is pretty risky.
r3 first then m3 maybe.];B[hg];W[hh];B[gh]C[both groups are settled so these  moves aren't  accomplishing much.  the big open area below is
more interesting.];W[hf]C[In view of the loss b is about to take, obviously g12 was
wrong.  at this point he could save himself with h15.];B[gg];W[id]C[here, h17 is better than h15..]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[ib]C[This
 was an unforseen loss.  I suppose I should have pushed onece more at
 H13 before returning to
 bottom.

kjd: ouch.];B[ih];W[lq];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[lg];B[nq]C[Is
 there a better move? It seems I can chase this guy, so I wanted to
 block the good attachment.

kjd: o3 is good but I'd play n3 instead.  Try to make him heavy.];W[lo]
C[kjd: here, w runs lightly.];B[lm]C[would the peep
 or a jump from the left grp be
 better?

kjd: since the white right group isn't so strong,
and you have the wall above (line 12), I'd play k5
or thereabouts instead of m7.  chase the opponent
towards your strength and his weakness.];W[qq];B[pq]C[black r4 is probably better.
now w has r4.];W[kn];B[km]C[now you are chasing w towards his strength  (d9/d6).]
;W[jn];B[il]C[how about g6 instead?  you'd much rather run
white towards j8 than block there, due to  your strength at j12.];W[hn]
;B[io];W[in];B[gl]C[hmm, this seems to let  w escape.  f6 was the last hope
of really making him run, and destroying some of his
territory in the process.];W[gp];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[fn];B[fp]C[This
 looks dumb now. R2 or R4 seems much biggger
  kjd: there are a number of bigger points.
r4 is big, and so are c2 and n11.];W[qp];B[qr];W[rq];B[rr];W[po];B[sq];W

;W[pl]C[trading q9 for q8 is wrong, it  solidifies white.
better to just play o9.];B[nk];W[mr];B[nr]C[o2 seems small, not much territory to  defend.  b5 seems bigger.]
