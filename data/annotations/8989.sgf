C[Do you think B should play at R5 instead of here instead?
your possibilities are:
A: normal joseki (in this case not the best idea,but better than R7)
B: perfect move here, uses the strong top to build moyo
     in fact the are many variations here but in any case Q8 is well supported by the top
C: not recomended [just for pros :-)\]];W[qo]C[This is a good result (locally) for white]

(;B[oi]C[This move seems quite slow for me, I'd like to play m17, see var before]
;W[nf]C[This w move helps black a lot];B[pf]C[good answer (honte), but now w gets the nice point n17]
;W[mc];B[je]C[B played here to prevent white from getting a moyo on the top. Do you think the capping move was too deep? In my opinion I think it was fine

I can follow your feeling about reducing well, but what can you do after w k16, see var ...]
(;W[jg]C[perhaps a w overplay, but in any case H17 is better]

(;W[me]C[to easy for b];B[kc]C[good point but still r14 cut is open, L17 not so important

w made a big mistake so you got everything];W[kd];B[lc];W[ld]

(;W[nb]C[this should be at m18 !!, see var];B[nc];W[md];B[kb]
;W[jb];B[la];W[jd]C[now the game is very hard for white (because of O18)

this move is slow, but if not r14 might be sente for b now ...]
;B[he]C[good move :-)];W[kf];B[pl]C[I had doubts over this move. I played it because it seems like the black group at P11 seems strong enough for a fight. What do you think?

I would fear still r14, if w answers now with Q9. see var ...]

(;B[ln]LB[mo:a][km:b]C[here locally (senseful or not) there are only two options:

N5(A) or L7(B) instead of M6, if none of both is senseful, the cut N7 was bad. see vars]
;W[lo];B[jn]C[Is there a better way black could have played the sequence out? It seems like my attack only gave me small points in the centre but at the same time restricted my development at the bottom. Was there another way in which my attack would have benefited the bottom group instead?

this time i can't unterstand the whole idea
m6 is simply wrong

if you got the bottom teritory, the center is not important at all, just m3 is good enough and honte.

Or still r7 is good.
K6 stays on the center and is wrong direction];W[ko]
(;B[im]C[I think this was a bad move. Probably black could have defended at L6 while continue to threaten the two white stones?

see var where i tried L6, this end up in some centerpoints for b, but the rest for w]
;W[kn];B[km];W[lm];B[hg];W[ji];B[kq]C[good idea, but m3 is the exact place for it (you saw the problem later with the ko)]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[dh]
(;B[eh]C[Was this move in the right direction? On one hand it seems like it strengthens the three black stones at H15 but on the other hand I was considering to sacrifice the E13 stone and jump out at H11 after getting sente

D12 is a bad w move, in this case both E12 or D11 is possible (D11 is more difficult), so well played :-)]

it's ok, but r2 is correct now!
s4 is bad];B[rp];W[sp];B[rr]C[I think black should have defended at R3 instead]

yes];W[kp]

;W[pn];B[oo];W[sq];B[np];W[no];B[eo];W[df]C[Except the N7 and some of the following moves you showed quite a good feeling for directions and judgement, i think.

Remember the shapes for using a cutting stone (normally one space-jump) never move diagonal out please (keep in mind: this is a kyu-move).

Hope the vars and the review answer your questions. 

Best wishes
