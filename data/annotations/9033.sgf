It's not urgent, but it's not small either. The mistake was playing R6.]
;W[fo];B[jc];W[pr]C[R3? Tenuki?

R3 would have been fine, also consider R14]
(;B[lq]C[This looks a little premature and could end up badly damaging your Q4 group.]
;W[lp];B[oq]C[Judging from the follow-up, this seems to be a terrible move, but it might just be that after M3, nothing good could come out. If you had tried to save M3 (with N3 or something), you would have severely weakened the Q3 group and given white strong central influence, but with this move you severely weawken the M3 group.]

From a wall that strong, you should go as far as possible, so this is good.]
