C[[Splinter\]: Hello, reviewer!  Thank you in advance for your time and suggestions.  I played this game as black.  In this game we played with Canadian byoyomi of 15 minutes for every 25 stones, so we both took plenty of time to think.  I felt like I was winning this game up until move 38.  After white 38 there seemed to be a fairly big shift in control of the game.  I think I still had a pretty good chance of winning at this point, though, since white had two or three weak groups still, but after failed attempts at attacking these I resigned.  I have added a few comments at certain points to help you know what I was thinking.]
;B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[eq]C[Good move - although 1 line higher may be slightly better. White really should not have given this opportunity]
;W[do];B[od]LB[ip:A]C[its rather inconsistent to play here - you should re-inforce your stone on e3 - somewhere around A - working with the q4 stone]

(;W[qj]C[Should be on the lower side - see variation]
(;B[gp]C[Got away with it...];W[nq]
(;B[qn]C[[Splinter\]: White O3 looked good to me.  I wanted to do a combination pincer-extension from G4, but the pincer didn't seem to work well with that R10 stone there.  I decided to play R6 so that at least one of his stones (R10 or O3) wouldn't be able to get a good base.  After playing it I kind of wished I had gone R7 since it would put more pressure on the R10 stone and would also give me a good result if white played Q2, but looking at it now I kind of favor a pincer around L3.  Are any of these choices better than the others?

The pincer looks good at first sight the tight  one at m3 is probably best-   but maybe doesn't work out that well because of r10 see variation

No point in "extending towards r10 - he will just extend to r13. Maybe attach and extend? But white can jump into the corner with a similar result to the pincer.

Can't help thinking that g4 is too far away. See variation further back for what might have happened then.]
;W[kq];B[oq];W[qg];B[iq]C[Should have played O4 right away  No pro player ever omitted  white o4 in similar positions on gobase so you should have been straight in]
;W[ko];B[np]C[He didn't take the second chance...];W[mq];B[de]
C[Bad move - a good white player would have made you suffer with a pincer here]
;W[fd]C[Bad play by white];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb]C[As white I would still have pincered here]
;B[cj]C[Rather than suffer this excellent black move];W[mc]
;B[cr]LB[me:A]C[Don't ignore n17 - cap with A- keep the white stones separated]
;W[me];B[cm];W[dh]C[Why do both players ignore black's thin corner enclosure?

Why does white leave his c4 stones floating?];B[ff]LB[ef:A]
C[[Splinter\]: I wanted to push into white's top moyo some and also develop some thickness to fight the C4 group by chasing D12.

but f14 is too far - it can be cut very easily as happened later - better to stick with A]

(;W[fh];B[ei]LB[eg:B][en:A]C[If you want to play on this side then press against d5 first at A.

Then peep from the other side at B - will prevent the cut that happened later 

Peeping from this side just makes it possible - white will have thanked you for this move....]
;W[eh];B[hf]LB[fe:A]C[Better at A stops the cut - and presses against white's upper side]

(;W[ci]
(;B[dj]LB[bj:B][dj:A]C[[Splinter\]: My assessment at this point was that I was ahead.  White has 3 weak groups (D12, C4, and L3), and I only have C17 and P16 to look after, and I felt like both of these groups were better off than any of white's groups.

Yes but  the weak knight's move is the key point - you can't make a strategic assessment without accounting for all the tactical possibilities

btw
A is inefficient  B is better];W[ef]C[[Splinter\]: This cutting move changed the game.  Suddenly white's E12 group was safe, and I couldn't chase it to build up influence for fighting white's other weak groups anymore.  Furthermore, I knew I probably wouldn't be able to keep D15 alive in sente.  Plus white's top moyo got much stronger after this cut.]

(;B[ee];W[fe];B[eg];W[gf];B[df];W[gg];B[cg];W[ch];B[bb];W[ba]
;B[bf]C[[Splinter\]: Maybe better just to play B14 directly without the B18/B19 exchange?]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[ac];B[gj]C[[Splinter\]: Now, how should I have attacked the D5 group?  C6 looked like a vital point, but I decided to attack from a distance instead.  If white lived I figured it would be small and I would be thick on the outside.]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[fo];B[go];W[fm];B[hm]C[The sequence that follows is a classic of attacking you opponent - and not keeping an eye on your own stones.. - been there many times myself...

You added too many stones to your lower left group];W[hl];B[gl]

(;B[kp]C[Up is surely better];W[lo];B[jp];W[mo];B[or]C[[Splinter\]: O5 would have probably been better, but at this point I felt like I needed a kill in order to stay in the game.

Yes - but you weren't likely to kill with such a thin group...]

General comments

Try yo make your stones work together.

Look after your own weak points before going after your opponent.

Spread your positions out a little - to avoid inefficiency]
