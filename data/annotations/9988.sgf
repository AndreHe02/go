C[B: Hi, I'm Bart and I'll to do a review of your game.];B[qd]
;W[dp];B[oc];W[qp];B[dc];W[oq];B[ee];W[ci]C[B: good approach after the strange move E15 by black.]
;B[dg]
(;W[cg]C[B: I'd prefer B13 - not direct contact with black and still threatening to get into the area on the left.]
;B[cf];W[bf]C[I think this was overplay, but I did not see that at the time. I would probably play B13 or D12 instead, but maybe C13 was already too much.

B: yes.];B[bg];W[ch];B[be]
(;W[ag]C[I should probably have played B12 first, had Black played the variation things would have gone from bad to worse.

B: yes.]
(;B[af];W[bh];B[bf]
(;W[ah]C[B: this is a good moment to tenuki. See variation.]
;B[df]C[B: no need to for black.];W[dl]C[This was an attempt at protecting my now heavy group

B: better play it a bit lower then, e.g. C7.];B[di];W[dj];B[ei]
;W[jq]C[Since I didn't need to respond, I tried to build a bit of a framework.

B: good idea. I'd prefer to play on the right side, e.g. Q10.]
;B[hc]C[B: black could also play around Q10.];W[pj]C[At this point I though I was not too far behind, I was looking to confine Black to the top of the board, and maybe splitting his groups around M16

B: good];B[pg];W[qi];B[qh]
(;W[pm]C[I should probably have defended where Black was attacking instead of tracing lines..

B: yes, better play S11.];B[ri];W[rj];B[pi];W[qj]C[Now I have little hopes of attacking the upper right corner.

B: true, but you can still get some points in the center or reduce black there.]
;B[oj];W[ok];B[nk]C[B: this way black gives you a nice opportunity.]
;W[oi];B[ph];W[nj];B[mj]
(;W[nl]C[I'm not convinced this was a good move. I knew Black would connect and I'm not really gaining anything in the exchange, but I don't see where I should have defended instead. For example I think that N9 would have pushed him down ruining my territory.

B: or N11. Then you have a weak black group to push around, and you get into the upper framework of black. See variation.]
;B[mk];W[rh]C[Wrong time to tenuki, I though he would answer but in hindsight of course the only thing to do for Black was sacrifice the stone and take sente.

B: yes. N11 is way better.];B[ni];W[oj];B[oh]
(;W[si]C[B: taking the stone instead of cutting at N11 misses an opportunity. See some variations]
;B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[mn]C[And now I've lost control of the center and I'm practically walled-in, but I'm not sure how it hapenned!

B: yes, it was a bit difficult. There was only a short opportunity to pressure black and use the weakness at N11. Now he has a wall of 4 stones.]
;B[nn]
(;W[no]C[B: see variation. Try not to make cutting points, but keep your stones strong.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[ol];W[om];B[pl];W[oo];B[ql]
(;W[rl]LB[rg:B][oj:A]C[B: better keep a bit of a distance. Your group A is strong enough and can even get a second eye with B.]
;B[rm]C[B: now black takes away another liberty from your stone.]
;W[qm];B[rk]
(;W[qk]C[B: I'd prefer S6. See variation.];B[sl]
(;W[pk]C[B: see variation.];B[rl];W[rn];B[sj];W[sk];B[sg];W[sm]
C[Maybe capturing was a mistake and I should have responded on top. I think that Black's invasion was reckless overplay, but in the end even though I got the stones, I lost the game. Was Black sacrificing this many stones on purpose inside to control the outside? Could I have defended better?

B: I think taking the stones is good at this point. You dont want to fight a ko when there are 10 of your stones in atari.]
;B[rg]
(;W[sh]C[B: here you could he played tenuki. See variation.]
;B[ln];W[lo];B[ko];W[kp]C[I'm happy to double-hane here because of the one-sided double-atari]
;B[mp];W[kn]C[I also think that Black's invasion was serious overplay, instead of preventing my double-atari. I felt that Black was very aggressive, but maybe he could afford it with that huge wall on the outside.
I'm not sure what would have been the better way to respond to what I think was a reckless invasion.

B: it's hard to see another move., so I'd say this one is ok.]
;B[lm];W[jo];B[lp];W[np]C[B: should have been at N5.];B[lq]
C[I should have protected N5 and Black didn't miss that! I think I got so involved in the local invasion, I didn't even bother reading what could happen to the nearby groups.

B: yes, he now gets a double atari.];W[kq];B[mo]C[B: at this point.]
;W[nn];B[ko];W[qg]C[This was intended as a very stupid ko threat that somehow worked.]
;B[qf];W[lo];B[lr];W[ko]C[B: good];B[in]
(;W[kr]C[B: better ignore the black stones at the bottom. They are not doing anywhere. A play around K8 is more needed. See some variations.]
;B[ks];W[ls]C[I always make this mistake on the first line. There are two stones around me, and I'm so quick to fight I don't realise this is self-atari!

B: yep. And giving black eye shape.];B[ms];W[js];B[ls]
(;W[ns]C[I blocked by instinct and once again I missed the obvious and played on the first line!

B: but good that you see it yourself.];B[nr];W[or];B[os];W[ps]
;B[km];W[ns]C[B: the black group will not live, so more important to play elsewhere.]
;B[jn];W[os]C[B: see previous comment.];B[fk]
(;W[en]C[While I was busy dealing with the invader, Black F9 I think definitely cost me a lot. At this point I'm pressed down and even though I killed a lot while I spend all my time defending I have little territory to show for it.
Should I have started an invasion next?

B: invasion is pretty difficult at this time, but if you're behind it may be the only way. But it's hard to see a good invasion point. I tried some variatons, but it is hard at this point.]
;B[fm];W[gn]C[A weak attempt to cut Black];B[hn];W[fn]C[Now I though I had to defend again instead of going in

B: yep.];B[gm];W[ho];B[el];W[em];B[ej];W[dk];B[cj];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[cl];B[bk];W[ak];B[ai]
(;W[bi]C[B: take away the stones, and you take away the forcing moves.]
;B[bl];W[bm]C[And once again I think that Black is very reckless, and playing in tight places with little hopes of even one eye, so I'm a bit frustrated to be so far behind on the score.

B: yes, I can imagine that. He's playing a ladder that doesnt work, but has a big area at the top. The moves are probably to get to close D12 in sente.]
;B[dh];W[al];B[jh]C[B: that doesnt close the area, but it was hard to invade anyway.]
;W[ck]C[B: ?];B[io];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq]C[This should have been G5, H3 is a disaster. I think that when I'm attack I want to respond too quickly.

B: yes];B[go];W[gp];B[fo];W[ho];B[eo];W[do];B[hp];W[ep]C[B: better play a ko threat, e.g. N11.]
;B[fp];W[fq]
(;B[ho];W[gq];B[dn];W[dm];B[hl];W[cn];B[ek];W[rf]C[This was an incredibly bad move with the idea of somehow making my way to the corner

C[I finally try to invade, but by now Black is awfully thick around here

B: yes, might have worked better from the upper side and then down.]
;B[me]
(;W[mf]C[B: when invading, dont make your stones heavy, give some away and make shape with the rest.]
;B[kf]C[B: not a good move by black.];W[kg];B[jg];W[jf];B[ke]
;W[le];B[ld];W[kd]C[I like this move, Black has to give me a stone no matter what and that seemed like a good jumping point for two eyes

B: yes, black is giving you lots of opportunities.];B[je];W[md]
;B[lc];W[ne];B[if];W[jd]C[I tried going closer to the edge to make some eyespace while attacking the three black stones]
;B[lh];W[ie]C[A forcing move to give me some room to expand]
;B[jf];W[ic];B[hd];W[kc];B[he];W[mc]C[And now I'm in a good position to run to the edge

B: yes, you got lucky here. Your group is already alive.];B[lb]

(;W[mb]C[B: wrong side, black can get your group now. See move 203.]
;B[kb];W[jb]
(;B[ja]C[B: should have been at J16.];W[la]C[I think that Black should have taken my eye at O16 instead of struggling with dead stones at K19.

B: or J16 earlier.];B[ma];W[ka];B[lb];W[na];B[ia]
(;W[lc]C[I secure some eyes

B: no need to. M17 and O16 are miai; you can play one if black plays the other to threaten you.]
;B[ib]
(;W[nd]C[And connect.

B: missed chance at H18. With your previous move, you already secured your eyes, so you could play elsewhere.]
;B[id];W[kb]C[Capturing the dead stone was a mistake, I should have played at K17, I didn't even see the atari!

B: ok.];B[jc]
(;W[nb]C[What would be a good ko threat? Forcing the two dead stones on the right to be captured?

B: it's not a big ko. Black can play H18 if he loses the ko.]
;B[ic];W[lg];B[ob];W[oe];B[pe];W[pd];B[od];W[pc];B[pb];W[se]
C[I know that I'm behind but catching up a little, and this is a thoughless attempt to get a way in Black's hole-ridden territory

B: hm. I dont see the holes. I see your stones are all in atari :-)]

;B[bs]
(;W[ds]C[I swear I'm not normally that bad at life & death!

B: ok, A2 was still possible];B[ar];W[cp];B[ap];W[ao];B[bo]
;W[bn]C[I missed the obvious atari on the first line. Again.

B: yes, that seems to happen a lot. Not much I can say about that.]
;B[an];W[am];B[ao];W[co];B[qq]C[B: a bit annoying, I would say. But as the left corner seemed to work, black can try :-P]
;W[nq];B[qr];W[rr]C[B: better play S4 or something, now you give black a stone to make an eye around. Not that there is enough room, but in other situations this can be a problem.]
;B[rq];W[qs];B[qo];W[pp];B[rp];W[ro];B[so];W[sq]C[This killed Black's group in my mind if it wasn't already dead.]
;B[sp];W[rs];B[sr];W[pq];B[tt];W[tt]C[B: ok, interesting to see the strange invasion working in the end. So if you defended the lower left corner better, you would have won.
But I think the main thing (besides the many 1st line mistakes) was to use black's weak points when they were still there. As early as move 44 it was still possible to get to the center and reduce black from there.
I hope I've been able to give some pointers in the right direction. Keep on playing!]
