;B[pd]C[MvdL: Due to some 'lucky' moves at the end of the game I won. But, during the game I really had problems to turn my influence into territory. What went wrong?]
;W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[gc];B[ci];W[qo];B[np]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[ql];B[kq]C[seems like underplay.  k3 is better.  also, f3 and d6 look nice.]
;W[nc];B[kc]C[MvdL: I didn't want white to play this move. He then influenced almost the complete upper side. However, I think M17 had been better.

i personally wouldnt play l17.  m17 seems better, but i would prefer r14, m16, o16.

i wouldnt play l17 with g17 so near.];W[qf];B[pf]C[MvdL: My intention was to become strong at the right side, so that I easily can attack white O17 in a later stage.

i see what you are saying, but it seems like it would be hard to do, because l17 seems like it is in a kind of tentative spot, as if o17 has too much room to maneouvre, while l17 doesnt have enough.  i personally would prefer o16.]

(;W[qc];B[pc];W[qe];B[qd]C[MvdL: I think Q15 had been a better move. But, I tried to prevent white from the corner.

i agree that q15 seems much better.];W[pe];B[qb]C[difficult situation for black]
;W[od];B[oe];W[of];B[ne];W[pg];B[hd]C[MvdL: My first idea was to play O14 but that would leave a large gap in the black moyo around H16.

h16 seems like a strange move, and i disagree with your reasons behind it.  it seems strange to try to make a moyo in this position.]
;W[nf];B[me];W[hc];B[gd]C[interesting move.  you are trying to build influence, with the c15 stones?  but also have the option of moving j17?  i am not sure if this move is good or bad, it looks pretty suspicious.

it seems like white should respond around d10, which he fails to do.]
;W[ec];B[mf]C[i think this move is bad.  you are inviting  white to push back, say, with n13.  but you havent played j17 to seal up  the other side of this territory it seems like youre after.  maybe you should just forget about this part of the board and move at d6.]
;W[ei];B[eh]C[MvdL: With this move I tried to defend my black moyo.

it seems like you have some potential territory around c13, b13, that area.  but it seems like you are trying to make territory between two walls with this is move.  this is something you should not try to do, it usually just helps your opponent - you get small gains and your opponent gets large gains.  d11, d9, c9 or c8 seem like the sort of moves you might want to try in this situation.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[cj];B[ch]C[i think b11 is better.  if white b10, then black can cut at d10, causing problems.]
;W[ek];B[fi]C[you are trying to make territory between two walls.

the white moyo around q10 looks ominous.  you might also try f4.]
;W[mg];B[lg]C[white is pushing and making his moyo bigger.  black is making small gains.]
;W[lh];B[pn]C[this move looks pretty good.];W[kg];B[kf]C[either m14, or you ignore this move and take r6.  i would move at r6]
;W[lf];B[le];W[fp]C[this is a good move on white's part.];B[ol]
C[this is a difficult decision to make- what direction to attack- r6 or p8?  it seems that after white f4, black should r6.]
;W[qn];B[ho]C[this move does not look very good.  maybe h4 instead, or h3]
;W[en];B[hm]C[the moyo you are working for looks a little doubtful.  i wouldnt try with this move.]
;W[lk];B[ll];W[ln];B[qp]C[MvdL: The white attack at M6 gave me a bad feeling. In my opininion R4 was at the same time a defending move for the black area and an attacking move on the corner.

maybe m8 if you want to protect your moyo.

it seems like you have a good philosophy, making moves with double meanings.  its hard to say if this was a good move in this case, however.

h3 would also be a good move at some point.];W[pk];B[po];W[fd]
;B[fe];W[jc];B[kb]C[seems k16 is better];W[jb];B[je]C[this move looks too small.  h3, o9, c8, c3 are good moves]
;W[hq];B[ip]C[this makes a big dent in the territory you might have had]
;W[ok];B[cq]C[i think this is a good move];W[cp];B[dq]C[i think black dies after this.  maybe b4?]
;W[eq];B[bq]C[i think black dies after this if white e2];W[bp]
;B[er];W[dr];B[cr];W[fr];B[es];W[fj];B[dj];W[dk];B[ej];W[ck]
;B[gj];W[gk]C[white is not playing this well];B[fk];W[fl];B[hk]
;W[jf];B[if]C[m13 is better];W[ke];B[kd];W[ig];B[kf];W[jg];B[hf]
C[seems like there are better moves at o8.

the rest is endgame.

to summarize-

playing with influence moves is very difficult.  try to be more conservative, dont overestimate your moyos. dont try to make territory between two walls.
