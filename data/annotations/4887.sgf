;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[pk];W[dj]C[Here, I tried to use that joseki that creates a kind of wall in the right side of goban (I think that joseki is san-ransei).]
;B[jp]
(;W[od]C[Is it correct that kakari? Here I thought that i could push black to the upper right corner and right side in order to claim upper side.

But I don't know if this is the best strategy in the early game. So what do you think about it?
RS: So far okay. Or you could play at K16];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc]
;W[ld];B[fq]C[Well, after Black 13 I saw that Black would be building a huge moyo in lower side abd right side.
RS: You are also building a big moyo.];W[qo]C[So i tried to invade here in R5... Could in Q5 too?

I don't know if was the best option invade or build more territory.

RS: Sometimes strong players say just keep building your moyo.  Let him come in to your area to fight.]
;B[pm];W[qq];B[pp];W[qp];B[po]LB[hd:B][pn:A]C[Here I think would be better play tenuki and go to another place, like B or C.

What would be better: protect the corner or the upper side?

I think would happen something like this.

(;W[fn];B[fl];W[em];B[fk];W[ek];B[fi];W[fh]C[Here I made a terrible mistake.

Because left side is more important that center (and he did a quite damage after F12).

I think that E11 would be the best option to me, right?
RS: Right just close off your side.  Your other group is alive so no need to connect to it.  There are no points to make where you played.]

Well, I think these are my mainly doubts about this game. I really should play more often because sometimes I have a bad feeling about some moves and shape in my movements.

Thanks for your attention and I hope you can help me.

RS: Try to play once per day.  
Your invasion on the right side likely lost you the game.
An guarding your left side would have been important.  Beware of the middle game moves getting smaller,  At some point the yose moves become bigger and you must switch to yose. Your F6 move was an example of that.]
