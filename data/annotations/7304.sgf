C[flintstone [5k\]: hi
stephand [5k\]: hi - have a good game


SD: In this game I have the feeling that I played too agressively trying to kill white instead of being a little more smotth but granting territories.
I have the ffeling I am taking too much risk and then at the end it is very difficult to manage the game.]

[dj:A]C[I don't like this move very much. It seems better to me to just complete the side. Hard to say what tengen will do.]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[em]LB[mo:A]C[SD: At this point I thought that I started to create a very big moyo in the centre and that my situation was not that bad.

Well you need to make tengen work now, if you get to push on the right you can do well]

(;W[cf];B[cd]TR[fc][gc][fd][ch][ci]SQ[cl]C[SD: There I hesitate a lot between this and a pincer at C11 or C12 but I thought that with the white group at the bottom my stone C8 was not very strong so I playedC16. Maybe F17, F16 or G17 would have been better as well.
My question in fact here is what to choose?

maybe answer with keime to then take sente to come back and enlarge the bottom side?

However the move you played in the game can't be that bad, but you don't play honestly after it]

(;B[ef]LB[eg:C][bh:B][ei:D][bl:A]SQ[gc][mo]C[SD: That was probably a big mistake but white didn't try to use it.
What should I have played here?

Well White has miai to live - so you must either fix your weakness or try to enlarge the bottom side]

;B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[gc];B[hb]C[SD: At this stage, I feel I start to be in a very dangerous position. Either I succeed to kill the white group and I am in a good position, either I fail to kill it and I loose the game.
How could I have been a little less advanturous?];W[db];B[cb]

(;B[de]TR[df]C[SD: here again I made the mistake that enable white to leave. I should have played D14 instead of D15]

I think that White should have been able to escape much earlier (he should have played N9 instead of M9 for example]
