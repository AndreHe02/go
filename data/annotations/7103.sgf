To the Reviewer:
Hi. Thank you very much for your helping.
I am very weak at opening.
In this time, I try make the biggest moyo, but I can't.
Please, try to see where I must play, to develop a big moyo.
Thank you again.
(sorry for my poor english: I read well, but I don't write well).


[Wrenn\]: 
Hello, I am Wrenn from tthe KGS go server. Thank you for submitting your review. I will try to address the opening concepts, and I will try to focus on the most fundamental of aspects and work up from there. Also, I will try to begin everything I say with [W\].]
N[Ask001];W[pp]C[[W\]: There is a level of heirarchy for opening moves, containing for general levels. It is a useful guide, and gives you a good guide for playing the opening. Keep in mind it is general guidlines, and not a list of steps, sometimes it is good to deviate from the hierarchy, sometimes it is not good to deviate from it. The difference between these boils down to how well it realtes to your game.

The hierarchy is as follows:
First Rate Moves:  
      Empty corners.
Second Rate moves:
      Approaching/enclosing an unsettled corner.
      Playing in the middle of two facing positions.
      Starting a joseki.
Third Rate Moves:
      Approaching/beginning to enclose a balanced corner.
      Playing in the midpoint between a facing and non-facing                 position.
      Any two or three space extension in an important area.
      Playing any move that strengthens you while weakening                  your opponent.
Fourth Rate moves:
      Playing on a midpoint of two non-facing positions.    
      Any remaining two or three space extensions.
      Playing the final enclosing move for an 4-4 point.


I will set about to explain what this means as the next moves get played. White here clearly has played a first rank move in an empty corner. You can always get to the above chart by going to "Options" --> "View Named Nodes" --> Move Hierarchy Chart.]
N[Move Hierarchy chart]
(;B[qn]C[[W\]: This is a 3rd class move when a 1st class move remains on the board. While it is playable, there needs to be a pressing reason. Please move on to the alternate threat here before continuing with the game :)]
;W[nq];B[dd]LB[dd:2][pj:B][qj:A][qn:4][pp:1][nq:3]C[This is good, finally playing the 1st rate move here. However, imagine the move order was as shown on this screen, with Black two being in the top left and White beginning a solid corner enclosre with 3. Would Black play close to White's strong corner, or would he block from somewhere farther away, such as [A\] or [B\]? Remember the advice "play away from strength. Here White can severely counter attack R6 with a pincer move.]
;W[rp]LB[jd:F][dj:E][pj:C][qj:B][pk:D][qk:A]C[This is looks like a very small move, but it is a powerful threat against R6. Before Black could jump into the corner and live small if White pincered. Now the corner is off limits, and Black should really extend along the top if he values the R6 stone at all. You can of course treat R6 lightly, and let White spend moves attacking it, but that means you are resigned to losing the stone, and should not later endevor to save the stone. Some good local continueations for Black are [A\], [B\], [C\], or [D\], although tenuki to make a san-ren-sei at [E\] or [F\] is very big as well. Keep in mind, playing there will give your opponent a bigger attack, but you should be better able to handle it.]
;B[jd]C[Nice 2nd Rate Move :)];W[qk]C[[W\]: Now he attacks. It will be very hard for you to get a good result by running away here, and you cannot counter attack his corner. A very nice idea is to ignore this move of his, and leave the running away as aji, a threat for him to worry about far into the future.]
;B[dj]LB[rk:x][sk:x][ql:x][qm:x][pn:x][qo:x][oq:x][nr:x][ns:x]
C[Kamelo88: Maybe P6?

[W\]: this is fine. He has spent 4 moves getting maybe 30 points. This means that he has gotten about 7 and a little points per move. This is a very slow way of playing, especially with Black making a super huge, co-ordinated moyo.]
N[Ask002];W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[[W\]: This is also fine, building your moyo. An alternate idea, especially as he is already so strong on the right side is to play Q14, forcing him to over concentrate his stones. Please see the variation before moving on.]
;W[rd]C[While this may be the joseki move, it seems very small and locally minded. The question to ask is which is more important, some corner territory of the Black moyo?]

(;B[qc]C[You chose the corner, however look at the variation to see what other ideas there are.]
;W[fq];B[dn]C[Kamelo88: Maybe D2?

[W\]: D2 is used when you can rally a powerful attack against the F3 stone, much like what went on in the lower right corner.]
N[Ask004];W[cq]C[Cut his stones if you can, otherwise D6 ends up very close to a very thick wall.]

(;B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[fp];B[eq];W[er];B[bq];W[dr];B[fo]C[Kamelo88: Maybe F6?

[W\]: the hane at the end of two stones is usually a very good shape, and is even better when it can be followed up by a double hane.]
N[Ask005];W[go]
(;B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[jj]LB[og:A][qh:C][gm:B]C[before we decide what action to take here, it seems good to make a rough estimate of the score.


Black has two sides, the top and the left.
White has two sides, the bottom and the right.


The Left and the Bottom seems of comparative size.

The Top seems bigger than the Right, because it is on the 4th line while the right is on the 3rd.

The tengen seems to build White's moyo up very much, but Black is able now to eat away at the edges while increasing his moyo. Black has to make a choice. B is a very solid turn, limiting White's bottom moyo and building Blacks. A is very nice because it threatens an invasion at C. If White was more ahead, then an invasion at C might be necessary.]

(;B[on]C[[W\]: Trying to save this now seems quite difficult.]
;W[nk];B[gm]C[Kamelo88:
Where is better?

[W\]: this is a very big move.]N[Ask006];W[ko]LB[im:A]C[[W\]: White chickens out. now is a fine time to get ahead!]

(;B[hn];W[ho]LB[im:A][in:B][io:C]C[[W\]:
A:  very timid
B: ok to keep ahead
C: it is always worth it to read out the double hane.]

(;B[jm]TR[of]SQ[og]C[[W\]: Black's invasion has worked out quite well. If the game was even last time we estimated, Black is probably a little ahead now.  Black has taken a huge chunk out of White's bottom, and White has built up his right side.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[df];W[ic];B[jc];W[id]LB[ib:B][ie:A]TR[ic]
[jc][jd]C[[W\]: White is in a terrible shape now. there is a saying "hane at the head of two stones". B will take away a little territory, but will help White make a base. A will start forcing White into a small position.]

(;B[ib];W[hb];B[jb];W[je]LB[ie:A]C[[W\]: cut at A first.]

;B[ll];W[mm];B[kk];W[ml];B[jl];W[mj];B[mh];W[cc]C[[W\]: White has built this group much bigger than my earlier 5 point estimate. This is because you began at J18. Letting White get stronger makes his invasion much harder for you to deal with too.]

[bo][co][do][eo][ap]C[So, I will sum it all up.

1: you missed the big juncture points, places where you could most efficiently build your moyo while limiting your opponents. 

2: You gave up one stone in the beginning, but then tried very hard to save it, damaging your prospects elsewhere.

3. You cut groups, but then sacrifice the stones, wasting some moves while making your opponent stronger.

4. Your opponent took all of the endgame points from you.

All in all you played a good beginning, better than your opponent, but it could have been more focused. In the middle game you gave up stones while letting your opponent grow, letting him invade your area very well. Especially when you pushed him into your moyo rather than sealing him in. In the endgame, you missed the big points, and let him pull further and further ahead. 

If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me, or contact me as "wrenn" on KGS.]
