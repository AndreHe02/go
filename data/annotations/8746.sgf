C[Hello.

I played white in this game as "jerhum".
Although there were some silly mistakes around the end of the game, I would like it to be reviewed.

Could you please give me advises on:
1/ What is the best direction of play in the fuseki?
2/ What were the main strategical mistakes?
3/ What are the concepts I should focus on to improve?
4/ How to better keep sente?
5/ Simple tips to optimise the yose?

See my comments in the game logs.

Thank you very very much for reviewing my game.];B[pp];W[pd]
;B[de];W[dq]C[jerhum: shall I start approaching in the lower left or in the upper left corner?

stephan: I am not sure I understand the question. Clearly White has to target the corner first and then it is Black that has the sente. So he will drive the next sequence... Unless White choose to not answer a move but at the stage a play around D4 is OK. Attack D15 would be  too early unless White has a special strategy.]
;B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[cp];W[er];B[cl]C[jerhum: what is the direction of play, here?

stephan: at this stage it is a tough question and I am not strong enough to answer.  I think I would attack one of the two remaining Black corners (the top left and the bottom right) with a preference with the upper left... As White did]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[fd]TR[eb][gc]C[stephan: this move (F16) is not joseki. E18 and G17 are the joseki moves.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fe]
(;W[gd]TR[fc][fd]C[jerhum: Is G16 the best move?

stephan: I guess White has to protect the marked stone. Otherwise Black playing on F17 might be very painful. The problem is coming from the move made earlier on F16. I wonder if White playing on F17 instead of G16 is note better? It is more solid and protect better de North moto]
;B[ci]
(;W[ge]TR[lc][nc][qn][nq]C[jerhum: Is G15 the best move?

stephan: I feel this move is much too slow compare to either:
- attacking the lower left
- playing an extension on the north];B[ff]C[Stephan: this is fairly slow as well there]
(;W[nq]TR[nc][qf][qn]C[jerhum: Direction of play? Was R6 better? Why?

stephan: It is a very difficult question and I am not sure I can answer easily. Simple extension on the North might have been considered.
The advantage of 03 is that White then is in a position to either make a big moyo or make a strong pincer on Black which is what happened in the next move]
;B[kq];W[iq]C[jerhum: I would like to get your point of view on J3.

stephan: I like this move. It keeps the sente for White. Black has to run without constructing any moyo... Which is good for White.]
;B[ko]
(;W[qq]TR[no][nq]C[stephan: I am not sure I would have chosen this. White will ending up been enclosed. It seems that White were not sure of his strategy. Playing O3 initially meant that if Black is playing around L3, White will attack Black. But playing R3 now means that this strategy is no more White's strategy. So if it were not the case, White should have played R6 at the beggining.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[np];W[op];B[oo];W[oq];B[no]
(;W[qj]C[stephan: good move. I think I would have played on R11 though because this way you prevent Black to have a base for life if he wanted to pince White]
(;B[ql];W[qg];B[jc];W[nc];B[gb]TR[fc]C[stephan: A White stone at F17 might have preveneted such move.]
;W[fb];B[hc];W[lc];B[ib]
(;W[gf]TR[bb][fh][fj][fl]C[stephan: again a very slow move. Why not play either at B18 so as to live definitely or on the column 12 so as to limit Black moyo?]
;B[kb];W[ke];B[if]C[stephan: J14 looks to be an overplay for Black. White can cut it fairly easily.]
(;W[gh];B[eh]
(;W[ok];B[ol];W[kg];B[je];W[kd];B[kc];W[ih];B[lb];W[fg]TR[mc]
C[stephan: even there N17 is important (much more than F13)]
;B[eg];W[nk];B[mc]
(;W[ld]C[jerhum: N16 was much better, wasn't it?

stephan: yes, no doubt. Once the mistake is made. White may consider how to stop Black for running inside the territory. Quite often is is by placing a stone one or two extensions away.]

;B[nf];W[ki];B[ng];W[nh];B[pg]
(;W[pf]TR[qf]C[stephan: sometime to play two stones in line looks too slow but it is very solid and it prevents the stone to be in atari in the future. Cost usually wil be no more than one point.]

(;W[jr]CR[qo][pp][qp]TR[ro]C[stephan: I would have continued on S5. Empty triangle is not a good shape so when it exists, always ask the question , what can be done against it.]
;B[kr]CR[jl][kl]C[setphan: A White move on this area builds some territory. Play at the second line is a Yose move so it is too early now (at least when there is still territories to be created.]
;W[bq];B[bp];W[br];B[bb];W[db];B[hr]
(;W[hq]CR[ir]C[stephan: I am not sure it is a good answer. Black can play on J2. I think K1 works but it doesn't look very obvious I admit. White J2 is definitely better and safer]

;B[pk];W[pj];B[om];W[hl];B[jl]TR[gn][ko]SQ[ik]C[jerhum: Is it possible to cut the black K8 stone?

stephan: As I said earlier, White should have played there much earlier. I don't think Black can be cut because of the two marked black stones nearby so White should have played on J9]
