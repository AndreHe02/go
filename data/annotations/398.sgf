[reid:  personally, I usually avoid the large knights move from the 4-4
point because it has so much weakness.  I only do it when the small knights
move just won't do.  In this case, white o3 would still leave to little
space for black to extend, so it would be OK, I think.  White could also
think about playing at m3, but that seems to give black a lot of choices.]
;B[fq];W[qp]LB[cn:A][hq:B]C[reid:  Hmmm, I think I would want to respond to f3.  I'd think about playing
patiently with a (c6) or attacking directly with b (h3).  I'd probably decide
to play c6 hoping my opponent would play h4.  This gives white the chance to
play r4 anyway.  It would be dangerous for black to ignore white c6 since he
can't be sure he could keep sente long enough to come back to h4.

I feel that n3/q4 can't really be attacked to effectively yet, so I don't want
defend them quite yet.];B[pl]LB[dn:A]C[reid:  This feels a bit heavy to me.  After white r5, the black stone at
r6 is going up against 3 white stones.  Rather than fight against bad odds,
it would be better to let this stone just sit there for a while and see
what devolopes.  As it stands, it is light.  Add q8 and it becomes heavy.

I think I'd play at a (d6) instead of q8 (since white didn't defend his
corner).];W[dq]LB[cn:A][hq:B]C[reid:  This is OK, but it feels a bit like white is overly concerned with
territory.  This early in the game, strength and weakness should be the
prime concerns.  I'd still prefer a (c6) or b (h3).];B[hp]LB[fo:A][dn:B]
[qh:C]C[reid:  Safe, but a bit tight.  And doesn't have much affect on white.  How
about something like black a (f5), inducing white to play b (d6) giving black
a chance to attack with c (r12)?];W[dn]LB[qf:A]C[reid:  This is a bit passive since black doesn't really have much of
an attack here yet.  Probably a (r14) is more urgent.];B[qh];W[qi];B[ph]
;W[nj];B[ml]C[reid:  The upper right is turning into black territory as he attacks white's group.
This is the way to get territory!  Nice move for black!];W[ol];B[qk]LB[om:A]
C[reid:  Black seems to be abandoning n8!  More consistant would be to hane
at a (p7).];W[pk];B[ql];W[ri]C[reid: Ouch! his move hurts black on both sides!  Good move for white :-)]
;B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[mm];B[np];W[nq];B[mn]C[reid:  This is really gonna hurt the stone at n8.  Perhaps black should consider
variation 1 instead.]
(;W[lm];B[ln];W[km];B[ro];W[rp];B[oc]C[reid: These exchanges have helped white a lot!  n8 is almost dead already, and
black has played a bunch of moves on dame points (n6, etc).];W[kn];B[lp]
;W[mg];B[jg];W[og];B[qf]LB[ch:A][bd:B][er:C]C[reid:  Saving two stones here doesn't feel too big to me.  Something like  a (c12), b (b16) or even just c (e2) seems bigger.]
;W[nd];B[nc];W[md]LB[ld:A]C[reid:  Jumping to a (m16) is probably a bit better.]
;B[eg]C[reid:  This looks big, but center territory is hard to take.  Actually,
black is only getting a few more points around h15.  But when white responds
at d12, he solidifies a lot of territory!];W[dh];B[op];W[oq]C[
 dongdong 4k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[cl]LB[fi:A][bd:B][lc:C][oi:D]C[reid: I don't think black needs to invade this deeply.  Continuing to
build the center with a (f11), securing the corner with b (b16) or
connecting with c (m17) should be enough.  I think I like c (m17) the
most since it seems to make the aji at d (p11) interesting.];W[ck]LB[dl:A]
C[reid: Neither white side looks endangered, so I think I'd play severely at
a (D8).  Probably black will live, but white should get massive central
thickness.];B[bk]LB[el:A]C[reid: simply running out with a (e8) looks easier.]
;W[bj];B[dk];W[cj];B[cn];W[co];B[dm];W[bn];B[en];W[cm];B[bm];W[cn]C[reid: this is too much for white to lose.]

;B[hm];W[fn];B[eo];W[go];B[hn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[ho]C[reid: once the black d8 stones are safe, white has no chance.]

 dongdong 4k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[ic];W[id];B[kc]C[reid: "From the cross-cut, extend!"  Since the upper-right is quite safe,
black should probably just play safe with j18.];W[jb];B[kd]C[reid: This gives white a big chance!]

;B[gf];W[ig];B[he];W[if];B[ge];W[ie];B[bc];W[cd]LB[ec:A]C[reid: This seems to let black live too easily.  White needs to
try something desperate like a (e17).];B[ec]C[reid: Looks like white needs 25 points in the center to be able to win.

their play a bit.  Make sure that groups are settled and strong before
launching a new invasion.  Try not to leave unfinished business behind.
