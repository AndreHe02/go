C[Hi reviewer! Thanks in advance for having a look at this game.
I played black, and felt like I had the more active role in leaning on white through most of the game, but still stumbled my way into a six point loss. Part of that was endgame blundering, but I'd be really interested to hear your thoughts on timing and direction mistakes in the early and middle game.

Thanks again!

Steve

Hon: Hi, Steve, this is Bernd from Germany, HonFu in the GTL and most other online go places. 

So let's see what we got here!];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ed]
;W[od];B[cc];W[bc];B[dc];W[be];B[mc]C[Is this a reasonable idea? w-14 tells me white sure doesn't think so. What would you be looking at in this position? Or would you avoid getting here in the first place? 

Hon: N17 as a move is okay, but there is a problem with the timing.

When you have this kind of position, where both sides have opposing kakari-stones, it is natural to play a pincer. Because this pincer will not only be a pincer, but also an extension of the kakari stone.

But you should play it right away, not exchange the moves in the upper left first. As the stones stand there, you have not finished the joseki, your stones have no extension. Later, when the upper right is settled, you might want to have another joseki in the upper left. Also, you might come under attack there, since you have omissed the extension.

Only start a joseki after you know what kind of shape you want to have in the sector. And if you start one, play it to the finish, do not leave stones standing there half weak!]
;W[of]LB[ob:D][qc:A][md:C][ne:B]C[Hon: This is a mistake.

If white plays here, it should be a move that aims to separate black. The moves from A to D are some options. This move is no separation at all.]
(;B[hc]C[Hon: Okay, now you still played the extension. Since white's move in the upper right do not work efficiently, it may be okay too.]
;W[kc]C[Hon: This is another mistake.];B[oc]C[Hon: Very good!

After this move, all your stones have reasonable, efficient shape. But white's stone at L17 is sitting baseless right in the middle of two solid groups - a very useless place to be! And the group in the upper right is floating in the center area with no meaning.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[nc];B[ob];W[nd];B[nb];W[md];B[lc];W[ld];B[qf]
C[Hon: This was a very patient sequence, confident that white is already falling behind. With M17 you prevented that white capture a stone for strong shape, then you played R14 so that you don't get surrounded.

And I should not forget to mention that you're ahead on points already. :)]
;W[qg];B[pf];W[pg];B[og];W[nf];B[oh];W[qi]
(;B[pj]C[Hon: This is not the best move.];W[qj];B[kd]C[Really unsure about this move. I was hoping to build a lot leaning on this floating group, but I was very afraid of white q9. Your thoughts?

Hon: Shapewise playing Q10 only to allow Q9 afterwards is considered bad. If you play Q10, you normally have to follow up with Q9. If you want to cut and fight, you should do it right away, leaving the right unsettled for now. 

But I think, my variation would be best for you.];W[kb];B[mb]
;W[ic]
(;B[ke]C[Hon: Very good. You play with "ikioi", the japanese go-term for "momentum". White wants to force an answer with J17, then push the other stone around. But you ignore the move and run out with L16 instead.

You should be sure that you can handle your group in the top left though. If not, then you have to answer his attachment!]
;W[ie]
(;B[id]C[Hon: I'm not sure if this is good. Basically at the end of the sequence white is connected and out, so you have not accomplished much, right?]
(;W[jd];B[hd];W[je];B[kf];W[mg]
(;B[ni]C[I was looking for something that would threaten the floating white group and/or let me hane at r9 by stopping white r11 from pushing straight through. Looks like this move doesn't actually do either of those things! would p11 or q11 work? Or do the L15 stones need to jump out urgently? Or something else completely?]
;W[lh];B[qk]
(;W[pi];B[oj];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[rf];B[re];W[rg]C[Hon: If white has to live in gote like this while strengthening you, then of course it is very convenient for you.]
;B[jg]C[Hon: You are still in complete fcontrol of the game.]
;W[ig]
(;B[ib]C[Hon: This is not good.]
(;W[jc]C[Hon: Phew!];B[jh];W[lj];B[ll]C[better n9? I blame o11 stone for this debacle. Your thoughts?

Hon: N9 looks necessary if you want to go on with your attack.

O9 was strange shape, but it ended in a good result. If you play N9, everything looks alright. 

Still - strange or bad shape has a way of coming back to haunt you later. So the idea that o11 might be faulty is at least something not to completely dismiss.

Takemiya Masaki once said that the way to win in Go ist to make good shape all over the board. Since we can't move stones later, we should always be sure, that every of our stones in in the best possible position!]
;W[oi];B[mh]C[Doesn't work.];W[mi];B[nj];W[nh]C[Hon: What a pity.]
(;B[fq]C[Better f4? Also, the unfinished bussiness in the center looks urgent, but it goes ignored for the next few moves... your thoughts?

Hon: I also have a tendency to leave groups like that. But I think in this situation it might be best. After white lived in the upper right sector, your stones have lost a lot of their value. You can still push around the top white group, but it is not clear now, where you will get profit with this attack. Your wall in the lower right wants development though.]
;W[jq];B[lq]C[Hon: I think, this might be good. 

The normal move would be a pincer in the corner, but here white invaded and has to fight in the vicinity of your wall.]
(;W[hq]
(;B[cn]C[Better f5?

Hon: Definitely F5. You have a weak group in your moyo - attack it!]
(;W[dn];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[fp]C[Hon: This was somewhat easy on white. Your strength in the lower right goes to waste, but ...]
;B[gp]C[Hon: ... I see you still have plans with him. :)

He should have played f4 right away.];W[eq];B[er];W[ep]
(;B[fr];W[gq];B[go]C[Hon: This fight looks more difficult for you than my variation.]
;W[io];B[dm];W[en];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[gf]C[Hon: Here I wonder what your plan is. First you cut with G4, then you play b4 to hurt your D7 stones, and now you leave all of them half dead and play a move like G14 from your strong group, driving your weak stones against his strength.]
;W[ih];B[ji];W[ii];B[jj];W[kk];B[ij];W[fh];B[gj];W[gg];B[hf]
;W[if];B[ch]C[Hon: I see, you want them all. :) Risky plan though. You had a good game, now you're staking it all on this crazy multiple-group-fight. Looks like something the potential loser would do to complicate the game.

Have you counted the score? Even if white captures all the scattered stones in the upper left it is still close. You should be concerned about the safte of your center stones, now that you ran with them.]
;W[fj];B[hm];W[gn];B[hn]C[Hon: You got to have a clear plan here, otherwise you only destroy aji.]
;W[ho];B[fn];W[gm]C[bg8-wf7-bf8 ?

Hon: Definitely.];B[fm];W[gl];B[fo];W[cm];B[hl];W[fl]C[Hon: Big loss. You helped white gain on the left side.]

(;B[jm]LB[ed:A][ni:C][ij:D][pj:B][dk:E]C[Hon: Okay, I will end the review here. 

This game is a good example why it can be good to review a game which you totally dominated. You sometimes need to hear from a stronger player that the moves you thought were good are actually good. Also there are always points where your opponent just does not punish you. But the main reason why this game is such a good example - you dominate your opponent in every local situation as if he was much weaker, and you end up losing the game. How did it happen? There must be some kind of severe white spot in your skill, right?

First of all: You seem to me like a player who has a very good fighting intuition and can spot the ouch-moves in the opponent's shape. You read. That all is very good!

But often this kind of players (I also belong to them) have a lack of solidity and reason, of FOUNDATION. They leave positions weakish and suffer in the endgame. Largely this is what happens to you after this diagramm - white will go on torturing your center group while destroying some points here and there. And eventually he wins.

You should develop a healthy suspicion against leaving sequences unfinished. Because in this game you did it a few times. First you did not finish the joseki in the upper left; then you risked your opponent's hane below B; you played a tricky move with C instead of just repairing your shape with Q9; you let your stones in the center at D stand there half dead; and finally with E you left bad aji which your opponent will exploit later.

Not all of this was really bad - C was an interesting move and D can be called a reasonable strategy wholeboardy. But I can see a tendency there of not playing the proper shape move which leaves no bad aji.

So theoretically what you have to do is - don't start a sequence if you are not ready to play it right up to the point of safe, solid shape! And take gote at some crucial points to repair your shape, when it is thin.

But that is easier said than done. What is good shape? How do you identify it? I also know that it is psychologically hard to play safe for our kind of players. I also suffered quite long from the I-either-win-by-100-or-lose-by-100-disease. 

But I have developed a good practice against this condition, which you might wanna try. 

1.) Look for an opponent who is two or three stones weaker than you and play an even game with him (many will be grateful)

2.) You will very soon get the lead in the game because the opponent makes mistakes. But now the training - at no point in the game you are allowed to lead by more than 5 points! So first thing you have to do is to count points throughout the game. As soon as you get the lead, you MUST NOT increase the lead, but you must play patiently (or even slack), so that you won't lead by more than 5 points. 

3.) Also you might end up playing sloppy early in the game, falling terribly behind, and then kick his butt later. This is also not allowed. You must not be BEHIND more than 5 points throughout the game!

So simply put - you are supposed to keep the game close from the first to the last move. Since it is very hard, it is good if your opponent is a bit easier to control. Later you can go on to harder opponents. 

There are three good reasons for this practice:

A.) You practice positional judgement which is essential and should be the foundation of every of your decisions.

B.) You develop a more balanced game. Go is not about winning by 100+, it's about winning by 0,5. You will learn that you do not need to push and push and push, but that you can take a safety move once in a while and still have a good game.

C.) Since your lead is not very large, your opponent might find tricks to upset your lead. So if you have trouble with your shape, he might actually end up winning! So you also learn to play SOLID shapes that don't involve the bad aji of getting your lead upset in the endgame.

Give it a try - it can really alter your understanding of go!]
