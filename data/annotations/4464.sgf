AB[pp][dp][pd][dd]C[My opponent is an established 18kyu man on IGS. When starting this game I did not expect to win but was determined to try and put some of the principles that I have been told into action.  Time limit was 1min + 25stones in 10 minutes byomi

I play at between 20-25 kyo on KGS and at 22kyu? on IGS.

In order to try and improve I have been playing a series of blitz games and this is my first slower serious game since then.

I have tried to annotate the game myself to show my thinking and some variations that either I considered or that I saw in hindsight.

I feel that there were a number of lapse and loose moves in the endgame where I was intent on safety as opposed to pressing the position.

In the middle game I was unsure whether I was playing 'big' moves and felt that in many instances I was reacting to my opponenbt as opposed to try and set the agenda.

I would welcome comments about

a) my strategic thinking
b) opportunities/threats that I did not see];W[fq]
(;B[dn]C[My standard response to the kakari. Though I have been told to consider also ..]
;W[iq];B[qj]C[Played this to try and take advantage of my Handicap stones. Prefer R10 to Q10 as I feel that this is more territory orientated and I have had bad experiences with invasions behind my stones on 4th line]
;W[qn]
(;B[qo]C[Played this as I have a stone at R10. But again, what about Q6 instead?]
;W[pn]
(;B[nq]C[Chose O3 ( as opposed to O4 ) because of W stones on  3rd rank. Thought that  M3 would be too far allowing W to play at O3]
;W[no];B[kq]C[Trying to extend my base and squeeze W stones. BUT would C10 or K17 be bigger? Also R13 to prevent a pincer on R10]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]
(;B[jc]C[Again using my handi stones  and extending from them. As before rank 17 NOT 16..territory before influence. Hold what I have and try not to be greedy]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc]C[Preferred to Q14 as K17 present. Also fortifies my corner (?) tho this may not be true as R17 could be invaded]
;W[nd];B[pf]C[Q rank now ( as opposed to R ) as W stone not present]
;W[kc];B[jd];W[kd]TR[nd][pn][no][lp][kp][iq][fq]C[kklim> please assess the situation, at this moment of time, white is having more stones having influence in the center play than black. If I was white will think of way to join the center stones to cut cross all the black stones.]

(;B[cj]C[Again looking for a big play but it does mean that K and L stones are matched..the race to get ahead. Perhaps the variations are better?]
;W[cf];B[ce]C[As before];W[ci]
(;B[di]C[Considered D10 as alternative but thought this was more forcing. Also the W stones look weak and I thought that this 2 point extension may/should not work
Wonder if B11 better but my variation shows little to be gained]
;W[ch]
(;B[dj]C[This was played so as to build a wall supporting D6 and also giving a base to move out from D10/11 and I was unsure about D12]
;W[dh];B[gc]C[Filling the whole and trying to prevent W playing G17. I did ( briefly! ) consider G16 but if W plays C17 then G17 is better placed but]

(;W[fh];B[nf]C[Looking to limit O stones expansion whilst starting a framework of my own. Considered P12 but thought slow/  ( but did prevent an invasion at Q12 ) Also considered extensions from D10/ D6 R10 but all slow whilst worthy. F8 , like P12 also prevents invasion.. I really fear these invasions]
;W[kf];B[fj]C[Extending my wall and matching F12];W[cq]
(;B[cp]C[C4 or D3?  D3 separates W stones but I felt that C4 helps to build my territory and that this was a better bet than separating W]
;W[dq];B[bq];W[br];B[bp]C[Building the wall and giving me 20 points]
;W[cr]
(;B[mh]C[Was very unsure what to do here.
 N12 helps to form framework, helps to protect against invasion at Q12. Alternatives were P10 /F5 /G8. Also concious that E17 grp is a little weak but I cannot extend everywhere. Have 4 groups now, maximum I can manage. Looking now the W wall ( C3- R6 ) could have influence]
;W[kh];B[jj]C[For me this is adventurous. Aimed at trying to stop a connection between W wall at bottom and the W snaking stones along L
I played this ( K10 ) as I felt I could connect it to F10 or stones on RHS. It also helps my framework.

At this stage I still felt OK and not yet in the mire];W[jm]

;W[kk];B[jk]C[Now K9. I was now looking at possible opportunities for Table Shapes and bamboo joints to solidify my stones

Thought I was still holding on to my ( handi generated ) lead]
;W[pk];B[pj]C[Chose this to build a wall for R17 area. Alternative was R9 but prefered this move]

;B[pq];W[qp]C[Unsure over the next few moves but it worked out OK BUT..against best play could I have done better?]

(;B[qr]

;W[hf];B[hd];W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[nb]C[Small.  But is there anything bigger? Even now, nothing obvious to me.D14/ K12 / N14 / N15/ E4]
;W[mc];B[mb];W[hb]C[This surprised me, and threw my  thinking for next few moves
Considered J19 to separate W stones ( and variation shows that this would be better ) BUT I felt that I was winning and so safety moves.

C[I played this as a safety move against an invasion as a bettewr player might tend to take advantage of novice lack of skill]
;W[as];B[aq];W[tt];B[tt]C[kklim> overally, black strategy should aim at utilise the handicap 4 stones to build up center influence. Every challenge from the white should think of block them into side or corner...

in the game white is sucessfully penetrate into the center first at bottom right, then upper right and then join force in the ceter.

Personnally I believe the game may be much simplify by following this governing principle. Hope help.]
