I found this strange.

Agree. White is too busy];B[le];W[og];B[pg];W[oh];B[pi]C[Good replies for B, gets a lot of territory]

Leaning for strength, trying to settle

yeah, possible too];W[ic]

Same thing again

Yeah, that's why i didn't really like L12];B[jg];W[jh]

Though this is probably too good for white

simon.tve: thanks for the game
simon.tve: you play well

S. I had to go to class but I didnt think my chances looked too good...

Agree, that top center, all through the whole board group is still not alive, and you lost so much in upper left and on the left

Still an interesting game and your right is pretty big too. 

I think the most important thing is try to settle your gruops without hurting other groups (yeah, I know easier said than done :)

And do your tsumego and eat your veggies and your go will improve :D

Enjoy!
