C[Reviewer:

From a ddk perspective, this was an interesting game.  I have tried to be specific in my questions.  Please feel free to comment on areas where my understanding is weakest.

Thank you,
CaeZaR

s: Hello CaeZaR.  I'll be reviewing your game today.  I'm currently 3k on KGS, where my handle is samtregar.  That means I know a bit, but I'm by no means an expert - please feel free to take my review to a dan-level player to see what I missed!  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[pd];W[cp];B[mq];W[pn]LB[qm:A]C[CZR: Maybe 'A' instead?  But why?

s: I like your move better - it's tighter and projects influence.  Your first stone here is on the star point, so you're not expecting to gain territory.  A is more territorial since it's on the third line, but also looser because it's farther away.]
;B[jq];W[fq]LB[eq:A]C[s: This is good, although I find A to be easier personally.]
;B[qq]LB[jd:B][dj:A]C[s: Terrible timing.  This is much too small for so early in the game.   I follow Janice Kim's advice on the opening - "rush to plant your flag."  That means you should find the biggest open part of the board and be the first to play there.  In this position I think A and B are screaming for stones!]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[so];W[qr];B[rr];W[pr]C[CZR: It didn't appear to me that I could kill the corner.  I was happy with the result however as b gets surrounded in sente.

s: Black's shape is terrible, but I think you're doing fine even if you don't kill here.  You have all the influence.]
;B[sq];W[qi]LB[jd:C][cf:B][qf:D][dj:A]TR[pn][rn][qo]C[CZR: Trying to extend a good distance from marked stones.

s: Too small.  I think moves around A, B or C are all much bigger.  D is better too.  This move is cramped.]
;B[qf]C[s: Nice.];W[cf]C[CZR: I thought this approach was natural with the bottom left corner.  Comments?

s: Yes, this is perfect.];B[cl]
(;W[ci]TR[cl]C[CZR: Would invading into the corner have been better?  See variation.  I chose this move because I thought this applied pressure to b's stone.

s: Yes, good move.];B[cn];W[eo]C[CZR: Applying pressure to b while expanding my corner.]
;B[en];W[fn]LB[fo:A]C[s: Hmmm - this invites problems.  I think I'd extend to A.  A primary rule is to keep your opponents stones separated.  You're asking to be cut here and giving black a chance to fight for connection.]
;B[fm];W[gn];B[gd];W[bd]LB[cc:B][bd:A]TR[cl][fm][cn][en]C[CZR: Wasn't sure what move to make at this point.  It seems as though more pressure could be applied to b's marked group.  In the game I thought to exchange 'A' for 'B' to strengthen my group and then go back to attacking below.

s: I like this - it makes a strong base for your group and is probably sente.]
;B[cc];W[ef]LB[kc:B][ej:A]C[CZR: Maybe 'A' is better.

s: I really, really don't like this or A.  Both are very small - less than 10 points I think.  B is very really urgent now - it's the last big open space so whoever plays first gets a big advantage.]
;B[gf]LB[hf:A]C[CZR: This move felt like too much too me.  So I tried to expose b's weakness in the 2 space jump.  I believe I made technical errors however.  Please show where things went wrong in the next exchange for w.

s: This looks like a great move to me - it aims to build a huge moyo and restricts your moyo, a dual-purpose move.  Maybe it would be better at A, a little faster.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[ge]C[CZR: I'm not sure about this move.

s: Yes, this is nasty.  The shape you end up with is just terrible.]
;B[he]LB[fe:A]C[s: Black should be more severe - A for the double atari.]
;W[fe];B[hc];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[ff];W[ee];B[fg]SQ[ff][gf]C[s: black is kind - he makes you make terrible shape and then he has pity and makes terrible shape himself!  The marked stones are the dreadful "empty triangle".]
;W[ie]C[CZR: I played this in order to lead up to a reduction along the top.

s: ok.];B[hd];W[ld]LB[nc:A]C[s: This a good move, but maybe a little timid.  I think A is better.  Black's corner isn't complete - you can play there and expect to live with ease.]
;B[nc]LB[qc:A]C[s: Now black has the double-wing formation and invading around A will take finesse to pull off.  Usually that means you need some kind of threat to escape out to live.]
;W[lf];B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[ej]TR[ff][gf][fg][hg][cl][fm][cn]
[en]C[CZR: I'm trying to pressure both groups no that I feel my group at the top is fine.

s: I like it.  Keep the groups separated and one should die.]
;B[ek];W[fj]C[CZR: I'm happy to extend knowing it weakens b's upper group and strengthens my own.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[cj];W[dj]LB[bi:A]C[s: ok, but I think extending down at A is stronger.]
;B[dk];W[bj];B[bk];W[jh]TR[ff][gf][fg][hg]C[CZR: An outright attack on b.

s: Good.];B[hl];W[ij]C[CZR: To prevent b from connecting two groups.

s: I don't think you needed this.];B[hn];W[ho];B[in];W[io];B[jo]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hp];B[jp];W[ir];B[jr];W[rg]LB[sn:A]C[CZR: Turning from the bottom, I looked for the biggest move I could find.

s: Not bad.  The defect at A makes this smaller than it could be, but as it turns out black doesn't notice.]
;B[rf];W[qg];B[pg];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[ng];B[nf];W[mg]
;B[mh];W[mf];B[of];W[mo]LB[kn:A]C[CZR: I'm trying to exploit 'A', extend from my wall and form a moyo with my thickness above.

s: What is there at A to exploit?  Black can live below if you cut him off, I expect.]
;B[nk];W[kn];B[kl]LB[jn:A]C[s: Ok, black called your bluff.  He also doesn't think there's anything at A to exploit!]
;W[ll]C[CZR: Here I try to cut black off.  First, is this the right idea and second, is this the right execution.

s: Yes, right idea.  I think this moves is ok.];B[lk];W[kk]
;B[kj];W[jk];B[ml];W[lm];B[mj];W[li]C[CZR: I'm trying to take away eye space.]
;B[lj];W[lh]C[CZR: I don't want to see my upper stones get disconnected in the fighting.]
;B[mi];W[ol]LB[oj:B][pk:A]C[CZR: Maybe 'A' is better?

s: B looks like the vital point to me.  Black is dangerously close to making two eyes, I don't think you can aford to play loose.]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[pj]
(;W[qj]C[CZR: Is the cross cut better?  See variation.

s: hard to say - but this looks like black should be able to make two eyes, so I'd say try the cut.]

;B[lo]C[CZR: Black has escaped.  Better technique would have ended the game already I think.

s: Yes, I think you could have killed black, but you did well anyway.]
;W[jl];B[kb];W[ko]C[s: This move is "aji-keshi" - meaning you're taking away future potential and getting nothing in return.  This move could at least be a great ko threat later.  As it is you play it and gain nothing.]
;B[lp];W[kp];B[kq];W[nq];B[jc];W[jd];B[rs];W[ql];B[kd]LB[bc:A]
[sf:C][bo:B]C[s: so tiny...  big moves around the edges are still available - A, B, C.  One thing I've learned is that the little fighting moves in the middle towards the end of the middle game aren't usually worth very much.  If you're playing a move that's only worth 2 or 3 points you should instead look for an end-game move like A or B.  It's probably worth a lot more!]
;W[ke];B[id];W[je];B[md];W[kc]C[s: Way, way too small.  If that's worth 2 points in gote I'd be surprised!]

;B[qb];W[er]C[CZR: Didn't have time to read this out fully during the game.  And I felt I was far enough ahead that I could spare a move.

s: I think you didn't need it, but there's nothing wrong with a defensive move when you're way ahead!  You're at least 20 points ahead here.]
;B[sn];W[sm];B[ji]LB[rp:A]C[CZR: At this point, I figured w probably missed the play at 'A', so I saved it for later.]
;W[ii];B[kh];W[kg];B[ki];W[lg];B[ih];W[jg];B[ig];W[kd]C[CZR: Just make two eyes.]
;B[kf]C[CZR: ??

s: Not at all.];B[gg];W[gh]C[s: Even worse!];B[ol];W[rp];B[rq]
;W[sp]C[Black resigns.

s: Good game.  You clearly beat black in hand-to-hand combat in the middle game, and in life-or-death in the end-game.  You have a good grasp of how to separate stones and attack.

s: I think your biggest weakness is in the opening - you need to be more aggressive and try hard to figure out what the biggest move is.  Also, in the later parts of the middle game you need to work harder to find the biggest move - don't get sucked into tiny 2 point battles in the center when the edges are open!  Aside from that, just keep playing lots of games!

s: Please feel free to send me any questions about this review.]
