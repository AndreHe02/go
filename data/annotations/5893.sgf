C[Hello reviewer.Please review for both sides,especially the variations i have given.
  Thank you very much and have fun with our game.
  Game information is correct.

[EV\] Review comments will be marked [EV\].  This was a close game, and the players seem evenly matched.  I hope my comments will be helpful.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[qn]C[I do not like R6 anymore since it does not put enough pressure on black even if black plays in the empty corner in my opinion.

[EV\] This move is fine.  A pro *might* worry about such subtelties.]

(;W[pf]C[I did not know the joseki unfortunately.

[EV\] Strange for W to initiate this joseki, then bail out.  B gains here, since the corner is big, but at the amateur level this will not decide the game.]
;B[re];W[rf];B[qb];W[ld]C[I knew this move as the tesuji in this shape.
Good or bad in this situation?

[EV\] This looks too close to B thickness to me.  Any reasonable B response will split and weaken the W positions on both sides, while also preventing the W cut at O17.  The B corner is completely alive, so W has no possible attack here.]

(;B[nc]C[[EV\] Much too submissive.  Please verify that if B plays out, W cannot cut here.  (Figure out how the W cut works if B tenukies, then see how many B moves defend the cut.)

[EV\] B played several moves like this during the game.  B player -- you should dislike being forced to make purely defensive moves like this which have no outside influence.  Try to be more aggressive, even if it looks risky.  Better yet, spend some effort to read out a more forceful defense.  You may miscalculate and lose a few games, but you will also win more, and the wins will be more satisfying.]
;W[nf]C[I like it for white.

[EV\] This result is good for W, but only because B played an inefficient move at O17.  However, the W stone at M16 is not doing much either.  If you could pick it up and place it somewhere else, I think you would :)]
;B[eq];W[cj];B[fc]
(;W[df]C[See variation.];B[cc]LB[lb:A]C[[EV\] Good direction by B.  The top is not so big, with the "open skirt" at A.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[bb];W[bc];B[cb];W[cm];B[me];W[gd];B[fd]
;W[gc]C[[EV\] The shoulder hit was an interesting idea, but this looks like the wrong follow-up, an overplay in the wrong direction.  Nobody is likely to make any significant territory around K17.  I think W should just draw back and emphasize his center territorial prospects.  If B plays well here, the attack on the W stones should help erase the W center, gaining more for B than the small territory loss on top.]

(;B[ge]C[See variation.];W[fb];B[eb];W[gb]
(;B[ec]C[[EV\] B should dislike being forced to connect here and should try hard to find a way to omit this move.  I would defend the important cut at F15 first (see variation).]
;W[fe]C[I like it very much for white.];B[ee]C[[EV\] Wrong direction.  This weakens the B cutting stone and strengthens the W cutting stone.  W is locally stronger here, so B should not expect to be able to capture anything.]
;W[ff]
(;B[ed];W[ef];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[bd]C[[EV\] Since B has to capture here to live, this whole sequence was a disaster for B.  Note how weak the cutting stone at G15 has become.]

(;B[ic]C[Black misread obviously.
See variation.];W[id];B[hd];W[hc];B[ib];W[jb];B[gg]LB[hg:A]
C[Good or bad?
Should black better abandon them?

[EV\] Probably too big to give up now.  But this move is not a very good way to help the B stones.  Diagonal moves like this are good for attacking or pressing an opponents weak position, but here W is very strong to the left, so B has no forcing moves.  W can even push through and cut and still have no liberty problem.  A move one space to the right (A) makes better B shape.]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[oq];W[lg];B[mp];W[lq]
(;B[hh]C[[EV\] B should play lightly here.  Aim for a quick stable shape (sabaki), be willing to give up a few stones if necessary.  See variation for one idea.]

;W[kp]
(;B[bn]C[Is this a good move?
See variation.

[EV\] There are many large endgame moves left.  Maybe a pro could work out the best sequence.  My only suggestion is to try to work out which moves are sente, reverse-sente, or gote to guide your play.]

;B[ml];W[lk];B[mk];W[mj]C[[EV\] Since B breaks through anyway, maybe just M9 is better.  Then no furtner moves are needed to defend the left center.]
