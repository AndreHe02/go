C[[BrenBarn --- I feel like there were some particular points in this game where I did something wrong, but I don't know what I could have done instead, or how I am supposed to tell by looking at the board what the appropriate response is.  Basically I have trouble choosing between moves, so I just sort of randomly choose something that looks good.\]

You seem to have good tactical ideas most of the time, but you must learn how to use your moyos more effectively to make territory.  To do this, you must learn how to handle invasions, and how to invade.  This is a large subject, amd I also need help here, but there are good books out there.  Your endgame needs some work: Look at sente/gote.  Before responding to your opponent, think what will happen if you do not.

You are definitely stronger than your rank would imply, but with some work you can improve dramatically quite fast.]

I think this worked out well for you so far, as black's thickness after his atack at E17 is now looking at a reasonably stable white position.  You seem to think that you have sente here.  K17, however, is a bit far from O17 fo you to feel completely safe.  If you have a look at what happens later, you can see that the influence of black's stone at H14 is still going to make itself felt.]

I agree.];B[kc];W[ib];B[ld]
(;W[ke]LB[nc:A]C[I think this is the wrong way to go.  Now black can cut off the stones at A (O17). See variation.]

(;B[le]LB[kf:A]C[I expected this to be at A

REV: I don't think A is better for black (see variation) because this way,  he keeps the stones at O17 cut off.  If you look at the final situation, that was big for black.]
;W[kf];B[lc];W[if];B[lf];W[kg];B[he];W[ie];B[hh];W[ei]C[My situation on the left is the kind I find myself in often.  I feel like there is the potential for territory there but it is still so wide open that an invasion can really ruin it.  How should I play to maximize this potential?

I think this move is too high.  You must remember that your stones near the corner are still vulnerable, so this move will provoke an invasion.   Black cannot kill your corner, but he can threaten, and make profit in the process.]
;B[ig];W[lg]LB[qh:A][ql:B][pr:C][co:D]C[I don't think that this is a big enough move at this stage of the game.  Maybe you should work on your corner around C5 (D), or invade around R12 (A) or R8 (B).  Even a slide around Q2 (C) would be bigger.  Did you maybe play here because it was near your opponent's last move?]

LB[oh:A]C[How about P12 (A) instead?  If he cuts you off, you live comfortably and get influence towards the center.]
;B[mj]
(;W[mi]LB[oh:A]C[How about first playing P12 (A) first in sente, and then connecting?]
;B[hj];W[co]LB[dm:A][hq:B]C[I just made this move because it seemed like a good idea to protect this corner a bit.  Part of me wants to play something like A or B instead, though, to get a stronger grip on one side or the other.

This is a good move.  If black invades either side, you can squeeze the invasion without worrying about your corner.]
;B[jq]LB[io:C][gq:B][kq:A][hq:D][kp:E]C[This is the kind of move I don't know how to respond to.  I can think of various general ways to respond --- A, B or C, say --- but I don't understand which is better in which circumstance, or how I should choose between them.  In this situation I felt I needed to play A to ensure a stable base for my stones on the right.

I like D.  Your move at L4 (E) takes a high position after Black pulls back to Q6 after your approach at O3.  Going down to A, you're changing your mind.  So yes, you get to stabilize your stones, but he can then extend towards your shimari.  If you play at H3 (D) instead, you get a nice extension yourself.]
;W[kq];B[gq];W[jp];B[iq];W[fp]C[Does this move make sense?  Somehow it looks odd, but I want to keep black from popping up somewhere around here.

I like it.  You are making territory.  You don't want him to press down on your stones.]
;B[ho];W[hp];B[ip];W[gp];B[hq];W[io];B[er];W[dr];B[eq];W[ep]
;B[fq];W[hn]C[This is a great result for you.  You have contained black, and have good influence towards the left side.]
;B[cj]LB[ch:D][ek:C][cl:A][dl:B][ho:E]C[This is the move that gave me the most trouble.  How should I respond to this?  My instinct is to play around A or B because that is where it looks like black has potential to make a base.  I played B because I thought if I played A black could jump out with something like C and cut my two groups apart.

My main question is how I should think about moves like this.  At this point when I see this kind of move my instinct is to regard it as an invasion and I want to kill it.  Should I instead be content with something like D, securing my stones in the upper left and letting black have a bit of room?

In this situation, you must ask where is your influence, and where are your vulnerabilities.  I like C8 (A).  Put pressure on black.  If he lives small, that's OK, as long as you get territory in exchange.  B makes it easier for him, as he can slip under you.  Of course, you don't have to worry about a ladder-breaker on E (H5) as it isn't a ladder.

You shouldn't worry about black splitting your groups around C.  The stones in the corner should be fine.  They are in a better position than black's cutting stones would be..]

(;W[dl];B[bg];W[bk]LB[cf:A][bf:B]C[I suppose I should have connected at A?

Yes, you should have done something to connect your stones.  I prefer B (B14) as it keeps black out of the corner better.]
;B[cf];W[bf]LB[cg:A]C[It looks as if it works out more simply if you play at A (C13).]
;B[cg];W[be];B[cc];W[bj]LB[dh:A]C[In retrospect A seems like a better move.

Definitely.];B[dh];W[eg];B[eh];W[di];B[fg];W[ci]C[Now you have a problem.  After losing a group like this, you shuld have a look at the board.  Depending on the time limit of the game, you can either do a quick count of the probable territories, or just compare the different territories by eye.  Partly, this will help you to guide your strategy (aggressive or defensive), but it will also help you to see which territories are in dispute, and what the large open areas of the board are.]
;B[ag];W[oh];B[ng];W[qk];B[ql];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg];B[rf];W[rk]
;B[rl]LB[pr:A]C[Is this a decent result?  I feel like I reduce black's side territory quite a bit from what it might have been, but I strengthened his corner areas.

It's good.  You end in sente, and you still have a threat against black's corner around Q2 (A).  You are quite far behind, though, so you have to keep your eye on the sente-gote situation and see if you can reduce your opponent and consolidate your territories.]
;W[hl]LB[pq:A]C[What I am trying to do here is solidify some territory in this large lower left area.  Is this a good idea, or should I be doing something else at this point?  Like maybe pushing into black's corner at A?  Or should I do what I'm trying to do with a different play like A?

This looks like a good move to me, but in this situation, I would first attack, then defend.  The area around A is a good idea, but I think A ends in gote, which is not what you want now.  Maybe one point lower would be better.]
