Hope my comments help. Pls. forgive me for any misspelings or typos :)]
;B[pq];W[dd]C[I understand you play white so I will focus on your moves but I will comment on B move also...
The review will be sent to GTL and you. I would also like to sent the review to your opponent pls. mail me if thats o.k...]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qo]
(;W[cn]LB[jp:A]C[Playable - but I prefer comming from the other side. Since B has a shimari in the lower right corner (q3,r5) an extension around A (k4) would be ideal for him. His stones might seem very concentrated along the bottom side but in fact they are working idelly. Remmember one of the most important things in go is the effective use of ones stones.
See variations...]
(;B[dn]C[Interesting... But not quite good. (see var. at move 12)]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp]
(;W[cj]C[I dont really like this move (see var.) Still all this is probably playable...]

(;B[hp]C[Another interesting move - B shows a good grasp for the important parts of the board - but this stone should be played around A (k4).]
;W[jd]C[Good point.]
(;B[cf]LB[cc:A][fc:B][qf:C][pf:D]C[Wrong direction. If anything b should invade at A (3,3 point when the opponent has extensions on both side of hoshi.)  Black at B is equally wrong...
Black C or D would be interesting since it turns the game into a mojo contest..]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd]C[Excellent - B is in trouble...];B[cc]C[This move is obviously in contradiction with his last two moves...
All the same it seems the only options. I B wanted to invade he should have done that imediately.]

(;W[dc];B[db]LB[ei:A][be:B]C[B should play on the outside like A (e11) as W will have to play B eventually anyway. Also Black at B is better than this...]
;W[eb];B[bb];W[bd]C[Good for W.];B[bc];W[da]LB[bf:A]C[W trying too hard. A better - let B live in the corner - he barely makes 2 eyes while you get outside thickness which surpasses his profit.]
;B[cd]C[Good for B.];W[de];B[be];W[bf];B[ad];W[bg]LB[ch:A][di:B]
TR[cf][df]C[Now there is some aji left in B's marked stones and he lives in sente. Note that b shouldn't do anything about his marked stones just now but it remains a possibility for later (the definition of aji :))
Moves like and B practicly sente for B.];B[ef]C[1. Too hevy
2. Too slow
3. Too soon
See comments...];W[dh]C[Vital pont.];B[fg];W[fi];B[nc]
(;W[lc]LB[oc:A]C[W shouldn't pincer from his strong side like this except if the pincer serves as a perfect extension. A (p17)]
;B[ne];W[qf]TR[qo]C[White too low. The resoning behind this move was probably the B's marked stone. Still W at Q14 is much tougher on B. Remmember W is the one doing the attack, no need for submition here...]
;B[pb];W[qc];B[qb]C[B cannot get eyes playing like this so his group will be weak no matter what...
Why not play a move around h13? Since B has two weak groups he should play lightly (sabaki) try and get them connected or settled - in such cases avoid settling shape!]
;W[rb];B[pc]
(;W[rc]C[Bad move - B wants to get this group quickly settled so W shouldn't let him. (see var.)]
;B[od]C[This is why S17 was bad. This is too good of a move for B... S17 at R16 is joseki - sure it makes B' s19 sente but so what?]
;W[pe];B[ng];W[ph]C[Wrong direction. Since now B's group is practicly safe W should concentrate his attack on the other (e14) group.  Lets make a stop here and check the score. Black has 4pts in the upper left corner, 25pts in lower left (bottom side still too open to count.), 15pts in lower right and 1-2pts for eyes of his P16 group. His score is roughly 45. White has 15pts on the left side, 20pts on the top and 10pts on the right. This is also 45pts. Howerver W has only 0.5 komi so B is in the game. Now B has another problem, his groups arent all safe so white should be ahead a little. This disadvantage is not so big as W didn't properly handle the o17 approach stone.]
;B[lq]LB[jg:A]C[Although this is territorialy big it is not urgent. Somwhere around a much better - Get your groups connected.]
;W[jg]TR[ng][ne][od][nc][pc][pb][qb]C[Excellent. Good thinking. However since B's marked group is now much stronger this is not a good spliting attack. W should have j12 - and not leave a hole for b to get through.]
;B[em]LB[hh:A]C[Bad - W should play A now and win.];W[el]C[At d8 better.]
;B[cm]C[Neither one of you is concerned about B's e14 group?]
;W[dl];B[bm];W[cl];B[bo];W[fm]C[This is interesting white helps b soldify 6th line territory - B helps w make a wall toward his weak group.]
;B[fn];W[gm];B[gn];W[hm];B[fj]C[Too late now.];W[gi];B[hh];W[hf]
LB[ji:A]C[Wrong direction - A (k11) better.];B[hg];W[ji];B[hi]

;B[fe];W[gd];B[gj];W[ei];B[ij];W[hk];B[ii];W[jj]LB[jo:A][oo:B]
C[Contact play with your opponents stones makes both of you stronger, which means W is working for B now.
A and B seem good timing - Test what your opponent will do before returning too attack his center group.]
;B[ik];W[il];B[jk];W[kk];B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[lk]C[This just shows how unreasonable W's last moves were...]

C[Cut - see var.]
(;B[lp];W[mn];B[ni]LB[mb:A]C[B should rather spend a move securing his eyeshape with A which is incidently a very big jose point.]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[qm]LB[pr:A]C[Good. Big point. The only problem is that B is ahead on pts. Since there are no unsecure groups on the borad we are in endgame.
W should have tryed something bigger here like A and then resign.]

;B[cr];W[go];B[fo];W[br];B[ke]C[Good but j16 first - get two ko threats.]
;W[je];B[cr];W[bl]C[K5 is the only move. This is too small, b should d1.]
