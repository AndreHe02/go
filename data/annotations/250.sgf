;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rc];B[nd];W[oc]C[This is  unusual to me. Is there a way to punish, or is it simply different?

It is a very strange sequence for white, I think - white has 10 points of  territory in
the corner but at the price of a lovely thick wall for black. I think your
following move is OK, perhaps N17 should also be considered?];B[rd]C[I've been burned here before. I don't like to play this.]
;W[qm]C[This is a strange place to jump into now, I think.  I expected C15 or K4  or O3.]
;B[qo];W[rj];B[qj];W[rk];B[ri];W[rn];B[ro];W[om];B[gq]L[mp]M[rj][rk]
[qm][rn][om]C[Is there something else to finish up the right  corner? Or an attacking move?  I
couldn't fine one, so left the area.

I think you should pressurise the marked white group a little, allowing you
to take profit (you have read Attack and Defence, haven't you - great book).
Options for this are in the region of N4 (a).];W[nq];B[lq]L[no]C[(a) is much better, splitting the two weak white groups.  Now whichever of the two
white chooses to defend, the other ends up being weakened.];W[pr]C[Wrong. White should jump out to connect his weak groups.]
;B[qq]C[Black should split, as before.];W[qr];B[rr];W[pq];B[rq];W[op];B
[oo];W[no];B[on];W[nn]C[After this sequence,  black has been made to grovel in the corner (value 5 points
or so [if it lives {in gote}\]). White now has practically linked his  groups and
has so formed quite a thick group.];B[nm]C[This is good. You must try to keep those groups separate.]
;W[pn];C[I assume that black Q5 is the move which is missing in the  game record at this
point.];W[ol];B[mp];W[np];B[ip]M[nm]L[ml]C[Better to protect the (marked)  cutting stone by playing (a).]
;W[ln]C[It would seem the LR needs another move.  I felt it was liveable, so  perhaps I simply
make the wrong move later on.

I think you are right.];B[de]C[Fine. I'm not convinced that there aren't still possibilities
for attacking one of the white groups in the lower right quarter of the
board. Also, something like C6 looks good - it's usually good when you
can attack a corner from two sides like this. Either white then has to
grovel and live small in the corner, giving you lots of outside thickness,
or white has to run.];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[ci]C[what's the correct extension?

Don't know, sorry. Perhaps one closer (C12)?];W[nj];B[oh]C[This feels passive, but I feel ahead.

Ahead? Probably.];W[ck];B[ei]C[My thinking is this prepares to invade, and protects from  invasion. Is that right?

Yes, I think this move is correct.];W[cn]C[what I expected];B[dr]C[too far?  what about D3 or E2? Would J17 be bigger?  What about O7? Can it be
mobilized, or is it just aji? if that?

J17 isn't bigger. It may be better to play E3 or E2 because I think they
are sente.];W[cq];B[eq]C[Necessary?

I don't think so. Something would have been necessary if white had played a  more severe move like D3, C2 or E2.]
;W[mh];B[mb]L[sc]C[seems wrong. Is N17 sente? What about M18?

Shape looks wrong.
Better:

1) Stop the LR black corner from dying!
2) Menace the top right white group, probably with a hane at (a).];W[nb]
;B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[mc];B[md];W[lb];B[kb];W[ma];B[kc];W[ff];B[dg];W[jo]
;B[hc]C[I would have been inclined to respond to K5 by playing K4.  Especially if
you think you're ahead, it's better not to risk anything nasty happening on
the lower edge.];W[jp];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[kp];B[jr];W[gi];B[ni];W[mi];B
[mj];W[nk];B[lj]C[I  really thought this would work.  Was it the wrong idea in the first place, or  is the result acceptable?]

;W[nh];B[nf];W[oi];B[ph];W[pi];B[qh]C[seems this couldn't be helped.];W

[ie];B[ge]C[i thought the corner group !
 was attackable if cut, but obvious
ly it isn't. where would this move have been better spent?];W[gb];B[hb]
C[didn't want to do this, but it seemed big enough for this late in the  game.]
;W[rs]C[this is the loss. further review won't help.  I count myself  ahead before losing this group. I thought the game  would be decided by what  W could get out of upper center, and endgame points.]
