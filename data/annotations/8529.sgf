C[Mjondras [16k\]: Hi :) Good luck

-------------------------------------------

pz- hi, i'm pzykr, 9 kyu under a different name on kgs. i'll always preceed my comments with pz- so they're easy to identify. i recommend that you set your sgf viewer to show all move numbers since i will refer in my comments to the move numbers (eg, b5). if i intend to refer to a location on the board, i'll use a capital letter (eg, B5) . in this game, b5 is on P16.]
;B[dp];W[pp]C[garamayo [17k\]: you too];B[dd]C[Mjondras [16k\]: thanks]
;W[qd];B[od];W[oc]LB[nc:A][pc:B][nd:C][qf:D][jd:E]C[I don't know any josekis for 3-4 invasions, so I was a little lost here


pz- just as a point of clarification, w4 is not an invasion: w played there first. nor is w6 an invasion: w is protecting his corner.

a common and simple joseki to use here would be to play bA, wB, bC, wD, then bE either as shown or on K17 (depending on your strategy--higher [at E\] for influence, lower [at K17\] for territory). it would be a mistake for w not to play at D. (lower usually means closer to the edge of the board--higher, towards the center.)


a couple of general observations here...
 
--the fourth line is called the line of influence; the third line is called the line of territory. neither E nor K17 is right or wrong here: it all depends on what you want to accomplish--your strategy

--notice that either bE or K17 extends three points from the two-high wall of bA and bC.  this is in accordance with the proverb that instructs that one should extend three from two and four from three. further and one risks invasion; closer is inefficient, "overconcentrated," and "small."


a few words about influence: when one side builds territory using the third line often the other side plays "outside," on the fourth line. the "influence" referred to has to do with the power fourth line stones exert on the center. in the current situation, if b is at E s/he is on the fourth line, the line of influence, but the position is too "thin" to have much power yet. it's still early in the game! but if one is aware of the use and purpose of influence, and that is the chosen strategy in a given part of the board, then one chooses moves consistent with that strategy.

eventually, the objective is to make the outside influence "thick," that is, without "defects" or cutting points.  once thickness has been achieved (later in the game) the power of the influence makes itself felt. it is a mistake to try to use outside influence directly to make territory--very difficult to do!  the usefulness of the outside influence is in fighting. for example, if the opponent plays too near that powerful influence (a violation of the proverb "don't play near thickness"), one can often play on the other side of the offending stone (pincer)--the side opposite one's thickness--and chase the weaker stones directly into the thick wall, killing them.

i've talked a lot here about using the fourth line for influence; it seems easier to understand about using the third line to make territory so i don't emphasize that so much.  one should always be aware, though, of the balance between territory and influence.  see ishida akira's excellent book "attack and defense" for a thorough discussion of this balance.]
;B[pc]C[pz- this is a fighting move, "cutting at the waist" of the small knight enclosure of w4 and w6.  in general, i think it's a bit early to start a fight. the opening part of a game is called in japanese "fuseki" which means "scattering about" of stones. in general, strategy should preceed tactics. my previous comment is a discussion of the strategic possibilites. in particular, though, according to ishida yoshio's "dictionary of basic joseki," the shape of w4, b5, and w6 "always" secures the corner for white. with proper play, this corner belongs to white.]
;W[pd]C[pz- to keep the corner, w should probably have played 8 at R17.]
;B[qc];W[pb]C[pz- a mistake by w
b can live in the corner, using the "aji" (latent potential) of b5. (aji in japanese literally means "taste")

for example see variation]
(;B[qb];W[ob];B[rd];W[oe];B[nd];W[re];B[qe];W[pe]
(;B[rf]C[I did not see I was in atari, but was there anything else i could have done?

pz- the vital point of your position is at T17.  playing b19 at T17 should have lived the corner and there's some potential to attack w's stones above that are cut off from the lower stones by b5 and b15.  there also seems to be some potential to attack the lower w group--w4-w14. difficult for w to defend both. it seems like a complex position with lots of variations...

see variation of the last move for an example];W[qf];B[se];W[rg]
C[pz- mistake by w: w22 at S17 kills the corner];B[qe];W[qg]
;B[re];W[fq]CR[sc]C[pz- your vital point is still at T17 (circle). w should have played here with w26. i haven't looked at all possible variations but just on general principles, w has a good chance of killing the corner. (not as easy as it might seem, having played through some variations...the problem is w's weak stones above. still, may have created some aji or some ko threats for later use.)]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[dn];W[cf];B[fc]C[pz- this is a rather passive response, the "softest" way to play. it gives w the chance to play the good move of w32--your response on san-san (3-3 or C17) left your stones just a tiny bit overconcentrated.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[ci];B[nq]LB[jp:A]C[pz- ok. not a bad move. i'm looking at w26 and w28, though.  you might have played, for example at A instead to take away w's nice extension therebouts from those two w stones.]
;W[kq]C[pz- overplay by w--one too many spaces from his two-high wall. however, it would take a good bit of fighting skill to punish him for this move.]
;B[pr];W[qq];B[no]C[I am thinking now that maybe extending my base at m2 would be better, since it would force a response

pz- indeed M2 would "force a response," but would more likely benefit w than b. imagine after you'd made that move, w40 at b39: w would have the makings of a nice moyo (potential territorial framework) on the right side while you would be in a low, not-likely-to-be very profitable position on the bottom. the move you played, b39, could prepare the way for you to invade at J3, or example.]
;W[pm];B[lo]C[pz- alas, we won't find out how that possible invasion  might have gone!  this does not strike me as a very forceful move. there are bigger points on the board.]
;W[pj]C[pz- this is a very large move for w];B[kc];W[lr];B[cl]
;W[bk];B[bl];W[er];B[dr];W[gr];B[nc];W[mf];B[nb]C[Did I really need this to secure the corner? It doesn't seem so to me now, but at the time i prefered to play safe.

pz- after b51 i don't see any scope for those three w stones above to live: you're right, this move seems wasted. especially note that you now have a three-high wall but b43 is only two spaces away: terribly inefficient and overconcentrated.]
;W[fm];B[el]C[pz- what was the purpose of this move? i can't figure this out... the four b stones in the lower right are weak, for example. the only eyespace potential there could be destroyed by a w move at O2.]
;W[fj];B[hd]C[trying to secure some territorry, but i guess expanding somewhere would be better

pz- actually, this looks like a pretty good move to me: nothing wrong with "cashing in" on some territory, especially since w's right side is so big.]
;W[jn];B[kn]C[pz- the connection between w36 and w58 is vulnerable. on the other hand, "attach to make shape" (as your b59 attaches to w58) is less risky. you desperately need some eyespace for those b stones and this is a step in the right direction. risking more to attack the connection could pay off handsomely or could fail dismally...]
;W[jm]C[pz- the "attach-hane" proverb suggestes w60 at L7. i think w did you a favor with this move...]
;B[km];W[kl];B[mm];W[mk];B[mr]C[pz- ok: now you have some pretty good eyespaces, but look how you are completely surrounded by w stones. you needed the eyespace. you cannot expect to get many points in this area.]
;W[ff];B[hf]C[pz- i like this move. it challenges w's large center moyo.]
;W[hg];B[ig]C[pz- good: "attach-hane"];W[gg];B[lf]LB[nf:A]C[pz- how about "cutting at the waist" of the knight-move (w52) by playing at A? neither of you seems to play risky moves, ever. "nothing ventured, nothing gained."]
;W[lg]C[garamayo [18k\]: true];B[le];W[ki];B[ne];W[nf];B[kg]
;W[lh];B[ll];W[kp];B[ko]C[pz- no! you are forming "solid shape around small territory." this move induces w to strengthen his position in the lower center and gains you very little or nothing.]
;W[kk]LB[jo:A]C[pz- wow! pretty significant error by w. this is an opportunity for you to break into w's lower center area, expand your almost-if-not-already-completely-alive group and destroy some of his territory. the only move on the board here is at A--for either side.]
;B[lq];W[lp];B[mq];W[ls];B[ms];W[kr];B[mp];W[jo]C[pz- and the opportunity is lost...]
;B[oo]C[pz- again forces him to make a move that is an advantage to him]
;W[po];B[om];W[on];B[nn];W[pn];B[ol];W[ok];B[pl];W[ql]C[pz- next b Q9, which sets up an atari against w98. this way you might have some chance of breaking through the w encirclement. every point you can take away from w is two points for you--one he doesn't have and one you do...]
;B[nl]C[pz- just too passive, you might have pushed up from b79, maybe, or tried anything else that wouldn't make you lose the point at O7 as this moves does.]
;W[ml];B[nm]LB[nk:A][nj:B][lk:C]C[did not need this (i can see now), would q9 be any good? Maybe j11?

pz- eventually, you will need this move, but right now this move was no better than a pass. much better would have been b103 at A. w should block this at B, then when you atari two w stones with C, you force either a loss of two stones for black or the opportunity to push out of the encirclement and erase (keshi) some of w's territory (not much, maybe--but you only lost by 2.5!)]
;W[lk];B[lm];W[op];B[np]LB[oq:A][qr:B]C[pz- again, just too passive! this point was dame! better would have been A. or better yet B.]
;W[mn]C[pz- totally wasted move by w];B[qr];W[ih];B[jg];W[me]
;B[md];W[nk];B[rq]C[pz- this was a good move: several points he doesn't get swings the score twice in your direction.]
;W[rp];B[pq];W[qp];B[rr];W[sq];B[sr];W[oq];B[or];W[sp];B[fk]
LB[ck:A][bj:B][ej:C][df:D]C[pz- i've been looking in the direction for a while. but i don't think this was the best way to use your sente (initiative) here. "forcing moves first," you could have played bA, wB, then (without reading it out very deeply) perhaps bC or bD. use your sente to squeeze as many points as you can out of his territory! also, the move at B17 is quite large, but use your forcing moves (look for others!) before making the gote (opposite of sente) move at B17. actually, since after bB17, w32 would be vulnerable to attack, maybe it's not so gote after all :)]
;W[gk];B[ek]LB[ck:A][bj:B][ej:C]C[pz- no, no, no! first of all, this makes the classic bad shape "empty triangle." this shape is ineffecient because is has fewer liberties than a better shape would have. but this move is simply too passive. (i'm detecting a theme here). again, the forcing move at bA is available, and then you could attach at C. yes, w could then atari b125... but after you connect at b127 w would have to pay attention to cutting points and a possible double atari (read ahead a few moves!)]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[ei];B[ck];W[bj];B[cj];W[di];B[en];W[fn];B[fl]
;W[gl];B[fo];W[go];B[eo];W[ge];B[he]C[pz- this move is simply "following" w around and is very passive (again). you have some opportunities to create some action; it's worth a point or two to regain sente.]
;W[ed];B[ec];W[gd];B[gc]C[pz- since you made the passive move at b143, w gets to use his (free) sente to reduce your territory]
;W[de];B[cd]LB[bc:A]C[pz- another empty triangle, but this move's worst failing is that it was not played at A!]
;W[bc];B[cb]C[could have played b18, right?

pz- could have? absolutely _should_ have! this mistake alone was enough to cost you the game.]
;W[bb];B[ep]LB[gf:A]C[garamayo [18k\]: maybe we could play again some other time

pz- yes this saved you a point: not worth it! it was gote. you  have forcing moves you can make. look, for example, at what possibilites come about after a b move at A. (this aji has been sitting here for quite a while; i just haven't mentioned it yet...)]
;W[ca]C[Mjondras [16k\]: Let's do that. =)];B[db]C[pz- unnecessarily defensive. what could w do to you if you blocked at D19? notice, here, the extra liberty at C15... if w occupied that point, then yes, your move would have been best.]
;W[da];B[ea];W[ba];B[eb]C[pz- what on earth? w couldn't play there... this is one of the 2.5 points you lost by! plus it's gote: since your opponent doesn't have to respond he gets to take sente.]
;W[be]C[pz- two free points for you--w should have played at C15 if he were going to play in this area at all.]
;B[ce];W[ef];B[fd];W[ee];B[gf];W[fe];B[jh];W[ji];B[ak];W[bi]
;B[aj];W[ai];B[al];W[kh];B[es];W[fr];B[fs];W[gs];B[ds];W[em]
;B[dm];W[pk];B[gm]C[pz- not quite tesuji (finesse), as w doesn't have to fall for it, but nevertheless a nice move and decidedly less passive :)]
;W[gn];B[hm];W[sg]C[pz- obvious mistake by w, not tending to his cutting points...]
;B[gj];W[fi];B[hk];W[hj];B[hl]LB[gi:A]C[pz- these two stones are dead and cannot escape. why not play at A? look at the cutting points that are there after that move! without reading it out (you should, though!) it looks like there's potential for a bit of mischief around w110.]
;W[gi];B[hi]C[pz- oh my... i like what you're trying to do: you're a little behind and you are trying to attack to make up the difference. just, this doesn't work well.]
;W[gk];B[gl]C[pz- not necessary: w cannot play there without first connecting at G10]
;W[hh];B[gj];W[ii]
(;B[gk]LB[ij:A][hn:B]C[pz- the glob of stones that b199 is part of is called a "dongo" (dumpling). it's an ugly, heavy shape. instead of filling in the ko, how about a move at A to make the ko worth something?  see the previous move for variation and comment.

even a play at B would be better than simply filling in.];W[ik]
;B[il]C[Mjondras [16k\]: damage control! :D];W[jl];B[hn];W[ho]
;B[io]C[pz- what could you _really_ have done if w had played above you (cutting you) instead of below?]
(;W[ip];B[hp];W[in];B[gp];W[io];B[hr]C[pz- gotta give you credit for trying, though :)]
;W[hq];B[dk];W[im]C[pz- useless move- w plays a dame when he has a good forcing move at T14...]
;B[iq]C[pz- wasted move: this simply does not work];W[gq];B[rc]
;W[sf];B[kf]C[pz- here is another point of your 2.5 point loss! you did not need this move]
;W[tt];B[tt]C[pz- in sum, i think you lost this game by yourself... what's the theme? too passive!!! i like how you took a few risks near the end: too little, too late.  of course, the points you !gave away! would have been enough to win...

i appreciate this opportunity to review another game for the GTL. i hope  this review will do you as much good reading it as writing it has done me! many happy games to you!]
)
(;W[in];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gp];B[iq];W[ir]C[pz- this is about the best i think you can do, and it goes nowhere...]
))
(;B[ij];W[gk];B[jk];W[gj];B[jl];W[jj];B[ik]C[pz- this is worth a couple more points for b, as there have been plays made in w's territory. there are several variations but they seem to have much the same effect.]
))
(;B[sc];W[ra];B[rb];W[qa];B[pa];W[oa];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[pa]
;B[ma]C[pz- at this point w can play at T17 to get a ko, but there are few ko threats early in most games and nothing here that would save him.]
;W[sb];B[sa]))
(;B[qb];W[ob];B[rd];W[re];B[sc];W[rb];B[rc];W[qa];B[qe];W[pe]
;B[qf];W[rf];B[pf];W[oe];B[of];W[ne];B[rg];W[pa];B[sf];W[ra]
;B[se]C[pz- this is one possible variation. the b stone on P16 is dead, of course. w has thickness stretching across the top of the board; b has thickness radiating power down the right side.  this actually is a pretty even result... 

it's now w's move: he might choose to play F16 or F17, remembering the proverb "don't play near thickness;" either your own (inefficient) or the opponent's (dangerous).]
