C[White belettego 13k
Black Serenus 22k?

* My comments after the game are marked with *

It might look strange that that I post a game between a 13k and a 22k player (KGS rating) without handicap stones. First: It was an ASR league game, that's why there is no handicap. Second: My opponent's rank was marked with "?", so (s)he could be much stronger, and in fact I think is.
I post this game because I suggest that either we are even players OR I played miserably regarding my 13 kyu. I know, I played some bad mistakes by not reading enough (a time limit of 30 min sets me under pressure), but the consequences were annoying but not too big, it seemed.

I would like to have help on some general tactics or big moves or mistakes. I tried to comment on some moves where I thought help is needed the most. But these may not be the major points.

Thank you, dear reviewer, very much in advance!

(;W[jc]C[I feel this move is to small but I don't know where to play otherwise. I thought  I needed to protect my stones at N16 and P17, and playing G17/H17 would probably leave room for an invasion at K16 leaving me with two weak groups. I need help here.

* I think this move is good enough. If you play J17/H17/G17, black has a chance to separate the white stones in future. by. nono]

I also thought about F17 some times, but never saw a possibility to play there.

* I think Q12 is good enough, because if you play Q13, R13, black has a chance to separete the white stones. I think R13 is better than  Q13, because white stones looks more stable.

There is some possibility to play F17, but I think it is risky. by nono.]

;B[mp];W[lq];B[jq];W[lp];B[mn];W[rp]C[* small, I am afraid. but i thought when black plays there I might get in real trouble to get life or run.

* I agree with you. by nono.];B[ck]C[* See the right lower black group. This black group is weak, because there are strong white groups both the upper and lower sides. So black have to move center to live the group. And the black did in this game. by nono.]

(;W[ko]C[* I think that this white move was one of the worest movements in this game. Actually the white group was divided two groups at L4 later.
You should have played at K4 or L4.];B[kn];W[jn];B[km]C[* See, now the black group is safe enough, becuse the group can make two eyes easily now. by nono.]
(;W[hp]C[* I think K7 would have been much better here. But how high should I push the black wall? Or is it better to play K7 and then K9? Some help would be highly appreciated.

* I don't like K7, because the right white group will be dangerous.
   I prefer K9. But H4 is also good enough, becuse if black play H4, 
   you have to protect M4, and it is very big. by nono.];B[jm]
