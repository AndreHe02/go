AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Dear Reviewer,

This is the first game my friend Nelis and I have submitted for review by the GO Teaching Ladder. Please let us know if there is any additional information be should add in future.

Could you please provide advice for both Black and White as I will be discussing the review with Nelis.

THANK YOU!!! for taking the time to review and comment on the game.

Hope this finds you in great health and have a wonderful day :)

Regards LINDEN,


LINDEN 9K (White) vs NELIS 13k (Black) H4

Hi Linden,

My name is Horst Timm.

I'll do my very best! :)

Sometime I suggest alternative points without comment, just lokk at it]
PL[W];W[cn]
(;B[co]C[How should white respond to this?

First: Black should avoid contact moves. This is a bad habit.

On a leaning attack you should nobi (strect out) or bend.]
(;W[ck]
(;B[ch];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[again!, now it is not better];W[fd]C[ah, you know already ;), or a very quick learner]

(;B[eb];W[jc];B[mc];W[cf]C[good move against 4 stones, a bit agressive, but not greedy]
;B[ef]C[bad shape, no real connection and the net is too loose]
;W[dg]C[that's it!];B[dh];W[eg]
(;B[df]C[unnessecary (argh, no spelling correction tool)

don't push into keima, if you don't want to cut];W[cg];B[ce]
;W[eh];B[dj];W[el];B[ek]
(;W[dk]C[shape is not perfect];B[ei]
(;W[fg]C[oops, looks like a misklick,

you should avoid empty triangels]
(;B[fk];W[fl]
(;B[dn]C[not urgent]
(;W[dm]C[why offering black a stone?]
(;B[en]C[Should black have protected at G9?

I am not sure.
Black can live if he is sealed in. E6 is a very good point
But it is too risky!
Sio better play G9, YES];W[gk]
(;B[gj];W[fj];B[ej];W[fi];B[gi];W[fh]C[w captured stones, now the left side is strong.]

(;B[gh]
(;W[cj]C[slow]
(;B[cm]C[small!]
(;W[cl]C[you should play tenuki];B[bm];W[bl];B[em];W[bn];B[dl]
;W[am];B[gl];W[di];B[dm];W[hk]C[VERY BIG MOVE!

after a lot of small moves this is really big!];B[ff]C[good!]
;W[gg]
(;B[gm]TR[qf][qj][qn][jq][nq]C[small, what does it gain?
you are playing near w`s thickness 
there are so many good points on the 3rd line!

And what about attacking the w group at the top?]
(;W[ii]TR[qf][qn][jq][nq]C[Was this a wasted move? What could have been stronger?

Good! you discovered it already.
Your top group can be attacked

It does not matter if you captuere 3 stones. only 6 points!

If you like to attack, look at triangeld points]
(;B[fm]C[slow again];W[iq]C[good! maybe k3 or l3 easier]
(;B[hq]C[leaning attack again, makes w strong]
(;W[lq]C[lukewarm];B[ip]C[good]
(;W[ir];B[hr];W[jp]
(;B[kp]C[oops, too agressive, perhaps no mistake];W[kq]
(;B[lp]C[but this is wrong, I am sure ;)]
(;W[nq]C[good move, but I would prefer K5]
(;B[mp];W[io];B[hp];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo]
(;B[kn]C[no!!! there is no chance to fight in close combat against this strong w stones]

(;W[pr]C[Felt the Black allowed white to much space at the bottom?

You are right.
In attacking too close, w can spread his stones nearly everywhere!]
;B[qq];W[qk]C[good timing]
(;B[ql]C[HOLD IN!

golden rule:

Don't play leaning attacks]
(;W[qn]C[Overplay

maybe, but this is not the main problem, you should make it easier for yourself, so:

golden rule

If the opponent plays a leaning attack: nobi or magari];B[pl]
C[now this looks very good!];W[np]C[good!];B[mn];W[mo];B[lo]
;W[no]C[difficult for black now]
(;B[on]C[a bit between attacking and defense, maybe it's ok]
;W[mq];B[ln];W[po];B[oo];W[op];B[qo]
(;W[pq];B[pn]C[worst case for w!

b has got one strong group]
(;W[qh]
(;B[hh]C[comment in japanese style:

interesting move

























but what I really mean:



FORGET IT!]
(;W[ih]C[Read that white playing at J13 would not work. But was unsure as to how J12 would play out luckily white killed black.


Look at 107 in your variation

your move is ok];B[hg];W[gf];B[hf];W[jf]C[captured];B[ge];W[fe]

(;B[jg]C[Mistake

difficult to comment, because starting a fight with really dead stones is always difficult]
;W[ig]
(;B[if];W[je];B[gd];W[gc];B[ij];W[hj];B[id]
(;W[hi];B[jd]
(;W[ie]C[Black should have aimed at L16, forcing white to respond then at R 13

in the next move, yes. But the difference is small

this w move is not good enough]
(;B[qg];W[pg];B[qf]
(;W[oh]C[shape?];B[pi]C[ah, black has the eye to steal the eye (if this is english)]
;W[oj];B[qi]C[fighting spirit!
go black go!];W[ph];B[rh];W[nn];B[nm];W[jj]
(;B[ik]C[oh no! a wasted stone. There is no need to add another dead stone here
b missed to attack Q12]
(;W[jk]C[small];B[il];W[kd]C[Took way to long for white or black to see this move.

big move, but P11 is better!]
(;B[qc]C[Unessary move by black, i think?

sorry, I think you are wrong

perfect move, if b has enough territory. 
only alternative: attack!

even in an even game I would like to be safe in the corner.

Maybe you can make the corner more safe or bigger in attacking?]
;W[ne]C[I like to know who takes P11 ;)];B[pf]C[not good, makes the w wall perfect]
;W[of];B[oi]C[Damage by black

Very good analysis, yes!]
(;W[ni]C[bad shape];B[nh];W[og]
(;B[mi]C[if this "works" black wins, but isn't it greedy?];W[nj]

(;B[pk];W[pj];B[qj];W[ri];B[rj];W[mj];B[oe];W[nf];B[nd]C[close game now]

(;W[me]C[don't play empty triangel if there is an alternative point
(this is not a mistake!)]
(;B[ic]C[this does not work]
(;W[ib]C[I thought it would not work ...];B[kc];W[jb];B[ld]
;W[ke];B[le]C[very good sequence for b!];W[lf]
(;B[kb]C[N16 was begging to be played by both players but eventually black saw it later on

You are right!]
(;W[hl]
(;B[in]C[Do you know the toothpaste-metapher.
If you sqeeze too hard, all the white mess goes everywhere you don't like to see it!

Black plays the toothpaste-style, in this case, it does not matter]

(;W[mm];B[ml];W[hm];B[hn];W[jq]
(;B[md];W[lm]C[this is black's stile];B[km]C[Mistake by Black, instead M8

maybe, but that is very common, so don't bother.];W[hs];B[gs]

;W[al];B[bq];W[ae];B[ad];W[ag];B[ee]C[LINDEN got very lucky

I liked this game,
very few mistakes or misreadings, a natural flow and interesting attacks.
Just go on playing, both of you have a lot potential.

Keep sente!
