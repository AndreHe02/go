;W[de];B[hd];W[ci];B[co];W[cp];B[do];W[fq];B[ck];W[cm]C[Was this move here a mistake?  Perhaps I should have instead crawled down the bottom side, or played at Q10 on the right side...  (TB)

Johnny5:  This isn't too bad of a move from what I can see.  You manage to seperate his stones and you prevented him from making a base on the side.]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[bn];W[cl];B[fo]C[Johnny5: Here B has no territory on the side, and just a small string of stones that he will need to worry about keeping alive later in the game.

W may think about threatening b by playing H4.  This gives the possibility of gaining a larger territory.  (See variation)]

(;W[qj];B[qn]
(;W[qg]C[This may have been too passive; perhaps a more agressive play on the corners?

Johnny5: This isn't such a bad play.];B[nd]LB[kc:A][kd:B]C[Johnny5: This should have been a big indicator to you.  There is no way you can allow B to have such a moyo on the 4th line.  It should still be fairly easy to invade his territory at this point.]
;W[hp]C[This was DEFINITELY too weak. Bad move. Should have stretched along the bottom.  (TB)

Johnny5: This is actually a decent forcing move.  It threatens his string of stones at D5 and gives you the possibility of extending even farther on the bottom side.

(See variation)];B[em]
(;W[bk];B[lq]C[Johnny5: B has taken the initiative and gotten a very large corner.  Looking at SE you can see at this point B is ahead by almost 40 points.]
;W[jq];B[lo];W[qq]C[Johnny5: Jumping into a corner like this is pretty much suicide.  You simply don't have enough room to make 2 eyes.]

;B[sq];W[pn];B[op];W[po]C[Johnny5:  Okay, here you were able to gain a small amount from the exchange.]
;B[ng];W[pm]C[Johnny5: Way too small.  Think big.  Be sure to look at the whole board position, especially when your opponent doesn't play in a place that you think is very important.]
;B[hg]C[This move really kills it for white. Perfect box formation at the top. I would have needed to invade immediately after this play, and, even then, there would have been no guarantee of success....  (TB)

Johnny5: Invading after this would have been extremely difficult.  Reduction looks like the only sure option and even then, you won't be able to reduce much.  Jumping in at L16 before would have allowed you to run out if you thought you couldn't form a base, but now b could easily close you in.]

At this point, I'm guessing that I'm at least 10 stones behind, without a good chance of picking up more... (TB)

Johnny5: Toward the end you played a better game.  Overall you have a decent game.  Just be sure to work on paying attention to the whole board rather than getting caught up with a small area.  Sometimes you may notice the by sacrificing a small group, which may seem important with a small view, can be sacrificed and give you the lead when you look at the whole board.

Hopefully I was able to answer your questions, I I really hope that this review has helped you out.]
