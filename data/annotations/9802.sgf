B: yes, it's not a usual play, but not sure how to best to react to it. J5 looks like an option as well as your next play.]

LB[ne:b][kf:a][nn:c][no:d]C[At this point I was really concerned with White influence in the center. I was especially worried about White expanding the top side and right corners with something like A or B, or reducing my possibilities in the lower right with C or D.

B: a is indeed interesting for white. b is a bit too far - you can live under there. c and d reduce, but you can also reduce or invade (top left corner, top left or top right).]

(;W[od]C[B: see comment on variation.];B[of];W[md];B[no]LB[mf:a]
C[Here again I was not sure if I should have jumped again torward the center with A or played at 47. Again, I was really concern that White would play at 47 before me, so I did.

B: yes, I think it's better to play where you did instead of a, because your play also strengthens the corner. You can still invade the top left.]

B: yes, a or b is possible.];W[kj]

B: yes, bit more solid. But doing domething in the top left is more urgent I think.]

B: no, but the program doesnt count them as captured because point A is still open. If black plays here first, it's 1 point less territory for white. So it doesnt score, but waits for the players to make the decision. I think by passing, both players agree it should not be counted.
