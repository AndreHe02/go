C[I am 2k(IGS) and playing white. I lose the game and I would like to seek of advice on how to build up a mayo and direction of defense.

Thank you in advance for your kindly review.


*** 
Hi, glui. It's difficult to make a conclusion here, so, just read on and enjoy.

Hope it helps. :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[mp];B[po]
;W[jp];B[fc]C[Should I pincer the Black 9 or play on F16

*** It's a matter of playing style. A pincer shoule be ok, but after b jumping out, your moyo will be seperated.]
;W[fd]C[*** W #10 leads to an old and simple joseki, in which both b and w are settled up. Also, w is quite likely to lose his sente in this variation. 

*** W plays here first, but still ends up in gote, and w's shape isn't quite good. ( We will see it later.)

*** The joseki is rarely seen in pro's games.];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec]
;W[dc];B[jc]
(;W[cj]C[Here is my first puzzle. C10 or D10. I chosed C10 as I think white 8 is too high and black 3 was peeping to the bottom territory. Am I right ?

*** Books say that it's good to play a 3rd and 4th line combination in the opening. However, it may *not* be correct when you're trying to build a moyo, because the low-position stones will be the weaknesses of your moyo. ( You see it later: w doesn't have a good way to deal with b D11. )

*** I'll definitely go to D10. 

*** After then, if b still plays at 3-3, The position D10 will be much better than C10. See in variation.

*** W #8 is just joseki. B can get more territory at bottom right with n2, which is a big move, but not urgent. Also, w has a way to prevent it, see in another variation below.]

(;B[cq]C[*** It's hard to decide which side to block.]
(;W[cp];B[dq]C[*** I think it's important for w to get a sente here. See in variation.]

C[Another question. D10 or C11. I chosed D10 as I want to cash out the territory around the mid-bottom left and I believe D17 group is save from any attack. Am I right.

*** D10 of course. You're right, but you failed to save your D16 group later on. I have some detailed comments about it.]
