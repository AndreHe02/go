Hi, I am kex, 4kyu.

I think in this game white created several weak groups, and forgot to strengthen them before creating new weak groups - and should have lost because of that.

My general feeling is that in order to improve, both players would benefit from life-and-death exercises, for example Cho's elementary that can be found here: http://tsumego.tasuki.org/

Also, it would be good practice not to try to play calmly and territorially, but instead seeking for fights, to get practice.  BUT: when fighting, always check which groups are strong and which groups are weak.  Do not strengthen your opponent near your weak group, unless you are prepared to sacrifice.  Instead, strengthen your weak group and push your opponent towards your strong groups.

And a special advice for white.  Try not playing weird, fancy moves, or trick moves.  In this game, there are two good examples of such moves; first of which black was able to take advantage of, and second of which succeeded.]

I don't see the point in this move.  The area marked by the squares is not very big.  Instead, white A group is in danger of becoming very weak.  I think better to play L2 first and then  to the rescue of A]

kex: This move does not accomplish much.  It threatens to cut, but all groups are relatively strong

group A is very weak.  Attacking with a weak group does not work.  Black does not need to connect here, but can play for an attack.

Instead, black B group is weak, White C is still pretty weak, but stronger than B, so it is possible to attack B and strengthen C at the same time, by playing e.g. N11]

Everything else than A is alive, and A is dead.  So it only endgame is left.

If white wants to reduce, than by just playing E instead of first playing J14

Counting areas, black has about 110 points, and white about 60, so it is time to resign.  And - if white continues, black should just fix weaknesses.]
