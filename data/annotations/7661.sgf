C[Hello, I'm Pekka Keipi and this is a game from a tournament me playing black. I would appreciate a review for black. Thank you in advance for doing it. :)

DanielTom (DT) - Hi, it is a pleaser to review your game.];B[dp]
;W[pc];B[pp];W[dd];B[pe]LB[pp:A]C[DT - Good point. This move works well with your A stone.]
(;W[qg]LB[qe:A]SQ[pp]C[DT - This pincer doesn't make much sense because of your marked stone. It would be normal for White to take the corner with A and then split the bottom side - see possible variation.]
(;B[re]LB[dd:A]C[DT - I can't say this move is bad, but it doesn't feel right in this position. The reason is the A stone - if it was Black's, then this would be a good choice. See variation 1.]
(;W[nd];B[of];W[qj]
(;B[ql]LB[lc:A][oc:B]SQ[dd]C[DT - Black A instead is the standard joseki (aiming at White's weakness at B) and I think that even with the marked stone in place you should play it.
There is a tesuji here for Black that sometimes is very handy to know - see variation 1.
You can see my suggestion of play (Black A) in variation 2.]
;W[qd]LB[kc:A]C[DT - White can also skip this exchange and play at A right away.]
;B[qe];W[og]LB[oj:A]C[DT - This kind of moves are usually bad because they make Black stronger. If White really wants to defend here, A would be better.]
;B[ng];W[oh];B[mf];W[mc];B[nj];W[ne];B[nf];W[oj];B[nk];W[rl]
;B[rm];W[rk]
(;B[qn]C[DT - Black is happy with this result. White made you stronger without gaining  much in return.
By the way, you don't need to connect here right now - you can take sente and play another big move.
 -];W[jq]
(;B[lq]C[ -];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[dn];W[ip];B[eq];W[fr]
(;B[cf]LB[ck:A][hp:B]SQ[hq]C[DT - This is usually seen as an overplay - defending at A is correct. However, in this case, I would probably start a fight by moving out the marked stone with B - that would be a good way to use your thickness - see variation.]
(;W[fd]LB[cl:A]C[DT - White was kind :) I would be afraid of White A if I was Black.]
(;B[di]LB[ci:A]C[DT - A low move at A instead would be safer.]
;W[nq];B[oq];W[lr]
(;B[mq]C[DT - It is also possible to take territory here - see variation.]
;W[mr];B[np];W[nr];B[hn];W[hp]
(;B[jo]LB[hc:A]C[DT - I don't like this move: it is too slow. Black A would be much more active.
 -]
(;W[jk]LB[jo:A]C[DT - This invasion is way too deep and it is not necessary at this point. White should take advantage of your slow move (A) and defend the top side. See variation.]
(;B[ji]LB[hk:A]C[DT - Black A instead is probably better.
 -];W[hk]LB[ji:A][fm:B][jo:C]C[DT - The problem with A is that it exposes your weaknesses around B (which your slow move - C - didn't fix).]
(;B[fk]C[ -]
(;W[ii]LB[hi:A]C[DT - This is a tesuji to get a good shape but here it feels heavy (because you can cover White, as you did in the game). White A would make it easier to escape - see variation.]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[hh];W[gi];B[fg];W[gm]
(;B[em]C[This feels kind of slow. What could be better?

DT - Of course it is slow! The only option Black has is to cut - see variation.]
;W[mp]C[DT - This is an overplay.]
(;B[mo]C[DT - This makes it too easy for White...
 -];W[lp];B[lo];W[kp];B[kl]LB[hc:C][gn:D][ko:B][er:A]SQ[em]
C[Is this any good? I thought about playing A, B or C, what would be the best move for black?

DT - You lost a big chance to make things really hard for White when you played the marked move instead of cutting at D. Now you have a weakness at B so I guess this move is OK - it is sente anyway as it threatens to cut at D.
Of all the moves you suggested, C is the best.]
(;W[cq]LB[gn:A]C[DT - This is a terrible overplay! Connecting at A was the only move.]
(;B[cp]C[DT - I just don't understand why you don't cut at A... see variation.
You lost a big chance to end the game here.];W[ei]
(;B[dj]C[ -];W[eh]
(;B[hc]LB[ef:A]C[DT - Very bad! Should be at A - see variation.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[jc];B[cc]LB[ef:A]C[DT - Of course A is still better, but I'll ignore it from now on because clearly neither of you noticed it.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[fb];B[ec];W[fc];B[ed]
;W[ee];B[df];W[de];B[fe];W[ef]
(;B[gd]C[ -];W[eg];B[fh];W[ff];B[ge];W[dr]C[DT - Too greedy.]
;B[fi]C[DT - Good!];W[ej];B[fj];W[ek]
(;B[dk]LB[ck:A][gn:B]TR[cd][dd][be][ce][de][ee][ef][ff][eg]
[dh][eh][ei][ej][ek]C[DT - This is a terrible shape. The marked group would be dead if you played at A - see variation.
You lost yet another chance to end the game!
By the way, you can also just cut at B, it would be more than enough to win.]
;W[el]
(;B[dl]C[ -];W[fl]LB[gn:A]C[DT - Unfortunately it is not possible to cut at A and kill the whole group now... you lost your chance!]
(;B[hl];W[gl];B[gk]C[DT - Finally you cut something! Now the game is hard for White.]
;W[jh]
(;B[jg]C[ -];W[kh];B[ki];W[kg];B[hm]LB[if:A]C[DT - Answering at A would be the gentle way.]
;W[li];B[kj];W[lj]
(;B[gn]LB[gf:B][kk:A]SQ[gi][hi][ii][hk][jk]C[DT - This is a mistake - it is better to connect at A and capture the marked stones because the group you are trying to capture can escape at B.
 -]
(;W[kk]C[DT - This was a big mistake! - see variation.];B[gf]
;W[ni]TR[cd][dd][be][ce][de][ee][ef][ff][eg][dh][eh][ei][ej]
[ek][el][fl][gl][gm]C[DT - The marked group is captured so this is the last chance.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[ke]C[DT - It is better to find a way to sacrifice this stones in sente because it seems very hard to live here. Even if this group died the game would still be slightly favorable for Black. In the game, however, White tricked you and gained the lead because you added many stones to this dead group.
Needless to say, you wouldn't have had any of these problems if you had cut the left White group sooner.]
;W[je];B[kd];W[jd];B[kc];W[jb];B[kb];W[lb];B[ka];W[hb];B[gb]
;W[ig]C[DT - Great sequence by White. He is now leading!];B[gg]
;W[ko]C[DT - White was silly here - defending at S17 would be more than enough to win. Remember: when ahead, play safe!]
;B[kn];W[no];B[op];W[ln];B[mn];W[lm];B[km];W[fn];B[fm];W[ll]
(;B[bf]C[ -];W[pm];B[rg];W[rh];B[rc];W[qc]
(;B[qb]LB[rb:A]C[DT - Black could also play at A (the result would be at least ko) - see variation.]
(;W[pb]C[DT - There is a ko in the corner - see variation.]
;B[rb];W[rd];B[sd]
(;W[rf]C[DT - This is the losing move.
 -];B[nb]C[DT â€“ What a change of events!

Let's see what lessons you can take from this game:
1 - Don't play "empty" moves - move 49 (K5) was too slow, it was much better to take the INICIATIE to attack White and use your thickness;
2 - While attacking, try to drive your opponent in the direction of your thickness and not towards your weaknesses - move 51 (K11);
3 - Don't lose a chance to finish the game - when there is a weak group inside your influence area, be sure to cut it and then attack it (in the game, it was easy to kill it) - moves 61 (E7), 69 (C4) and 103 (D9) - you lost many good chances. Remember: "CUT FIRST, THINK LATER";
4 - Don't let your opponent overplay and get away with it it - for instance, see move 63 (N5);
5 - Keep your stones CONNECTED and then attack with full strength! - moves 73 (H17) and 77 (C17);
6 - Avoid bad SHAPES - move 103, (D9);
7 - READING is very important - in this game you lost many good chances of finishing the game soon, and then you were in trouble after being tricked by White (after the cut, that is, when you added many stones to a "dead" group (move 125 - L15) and your situation got even worse. White could have ended the game if he had simply defended the top right corner after killing your group, but because he didn't you were able to "make some noise" there and due to a misread he let his group die. This game shows how the reading ability of the players can determine the winner of the game.

I hope this review was helpful! If you have any questions/comments feel free to email me: danielfacto@gmail.com.
Best regards.])
