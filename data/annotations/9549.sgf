;B[pd]C[HI.  I'M YOUR REVIEWER (CURRENTLY ~5K ON KGS) & WILL PUT MY COMMENTS IN ALL CAPS TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM YOUR OWN.  LET'S GET STARTED...]
;W[dd];B[pp]LB[pq:A][po:B]C[Used to handicap games so opened with star points. Should maybe look at other common openings.

NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.   LATELY I'VE BEEN PLAYING 'A' THEN, AFTER WHITE'S MOVE, 'B'.]
;W[dp];B[fq]LB[fp:A][iq:B]MA[nc][nd][mc][qf][qn][qm][pn][np]
[nq][mq]C[Just used normal approach move. Unsure of benefits vs extension along the side of approaching from above to try to separate. Probably more to do with style.

THIS IS PREMATURE IN MY OPINION.  IT'S TOO EASY FOR WHITE TO REPLY AT 'A' (BEST) OR POSSIBLY 'B' AND THUS TAKE SENTE.    I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU DEVELOP YOUR CORNERS FIRST, SUCH AS ANY OF THE 'X' POINTS.]
;W[jd];B[jp]LB[gc:A][gd:B][nc:C]C[I think this is the normal length of the extension.

HERE WHITE EXTENDED TOO FAR AND YOU COULD TAKE SENTE WITH 'A' OR 'B'.  BUT THEN WHITE MIGHT PLAY SOMETHING LIKE 'C' AND YOU'D HAVE TO DEFEND.  THAT'S WHY IT'S WISE TO DEVELOP YOUR CORNERS A LITTLE FIRST.  

THE MOVE YOU PLAYED IS SOUND AND PROBABLY WILL LEAD TO A RELATIVELY PLACID, TERRITORIAL GAME.  'A' OR 'B' WOULD LIKELY LEAD TO PROLONGED FIGHTING.]
;W[dq];B[cf]LB[nc:A]C[BETTER TO PLAY AT 'A' WHERE WHITE PLAYED NEXT.]
;W[nc]LB[mc:A][ck:B]MA[cf]C['A' WOULD BE SAFER AND STILL SENTE FOR WHITE.

IF WHITE PLAYED ON THE LEFT SIDE INSTEAD (SAY, AROUND 'B'), YOU WOULD HAVE TO EXTEND SOMEHOW FROM YOUR 'X' STONE TO PROTECT IT.]
;B[pf]LB[oc:A][pb:B]C['A' IS SENTE AND STOPS WHITE FROM DESCENDING INTO YOUR CORNER WITH 'B'.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[dj];B[ci]LB[de:a][cj:A]MA[df]C[Feels like I handled this wrong. Only got a cramped base for my group. Possibly should have played 'a' would first?

NO.  'A' IS BETTER; IS SENTE AND SECURES LIFE.  IN FACT, IT'S NOT EASY FOR WHITE TO ANSWER WELL.  BLACK CAN JUST KEEP RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE.]
;W[ck];B[fc]LB[fe:A]C[I WOULDN'T HAVE CONSIDERED THIS MOVE BUT IT WORKED OUT WELL FOR YOU.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[ee];B[ed];W[dc];B[ic];W[pc];B[qc];W[ob]LB[pb:A]
C[WHITE WAS STUPID AND YOU MISSED A CHANCE TO PUNISH HIM WITH 'A'.]
;B[qb];W[od];B[pe]C[I was happy with this corner result.];W[jc]
;B[id]LB[fe:A][de:B][be:C]C[I'M NOT POSITIVE, BUT I THINK YOU CAN SAFELY PLAY 'A' FIRST. WHITE THEN MUST CONNECT AT 'B' OR LOSE A STONE.  THEN YOU CAN PLAY THE MOVE YOU PLAYED.   THUS YOUR LITTLE GROUP IS STRONGER.

EVENTUALLY BLACK WILL WANT TO MAKE THE SENTE PLAY AT 'C'.];W[de]
;B[di]LB[ef:a][be:C]TR[fd][ed][fc][id][ic]C[Seriously considered playing 'a' instead hit thought it would push him towards my other group (marked).

WHAT YOU PLAYED IS OK BUT I WOULD HAVE PRECEDED IT WITH 'C'.]
;W[pj];B[ql]LB[qn:A][qm:B][qh:C][nq:D]C[TOO FAR.  'A' OR 'B' IS BETTER.   NOW WHITE CAN START A NASTY FIGHT BY PLAYING 'A', WHICH COULD MAKE TERRITORY IN 'YOUR' CORNER OR SPILL INTO THE CENTER.

NOTICE THAT IF YOU PLAED AT 'B', FOR INSTANCE, WHITE WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND WITH SOMETHING LIKE 'C'.  THEN YOU COULD FOLLOW UP WITH 'D' AND HAVE A FAIRLY SECURE POSITION.

BY MY COUNT BLACK IS ALREADY ~10 POINTS AHEAD.];W[fp];B[gp]
;W[fo];B[mp]C[This is a nice move to solidify territory. However I was unsure if I should first have tried to split some of his other territory first. This is a gote move as far as I understand.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[Unsure which side was the right one to pick here.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[oq]LB[nq:A]C[HERE A 'FISH MOUTH' OPEN CONNECTION AT 'A' IS BETTER.]
;W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[go];B[hp];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg]
;W[eq];B[fr];W[ei];B[cj];W[ek];B[eh]LB[qh:A]C[At this stage I think I already let the area in the lower right solidify too much. Unsure when I should have invaded or have done differently to prevent this.

NO, I DON'T SEE THAT AS A PROBLEM.  YOU DO NEED TO MAKE LIFE FOR YOUR SMALL GROUP AT THE TOP.  

ALSO, YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT A STONE AT 'A'.  WHITE WILL PLAY THERE IF YOU DON'T.

FAMOUS SAYING: 'OPPONENT'S NEXT MOVE IS USUALLY MY BEST MOVE.']
;W[fh];B[ch]LB[qh:B][ol:C][bk:A]C[NOT NECESSARY.  YOUR STONES WERE ALIVE AND ALL YOU DID WAS FILL A POINT OF YOUR OWN TERRITORY.  

'A' WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS A LOCAL MOVE.  

ALSO, DON'T FORGET ABOUT 'B', WHICH IS WHAT I THINK I'D PLAY. AFTER THAT,  START THINKING ABOUT  'C' TO MAKE TERRITORY WHILE APPLYING PRESSURE ON WHITE.]
;W[gi];B[fe]LB[ff:a][qh:b]C[I thought white would respond at 'a'. Bit in hindsight it it definitely kit a sente move since both groups are probably alive for white... However I still feel that my group is weak and needed to be strengthened and this was the closest thing to a sente move I could think of. Maybe it would have been better to play at 'b' too make sure white does not get too much of a foothold on the right side?]
;W[qh]C[WHAT DID I TELL YOU?];B[qg];W[ph];B[nf];W[jj];B[lj]
LB[nj:A]C[GOOD IDEA.

I WOULD HAVE TO STUDY IT, BUT THINK AT 'A' MIGHT BE BETTER.

BLACK IS STILL AT LEAST 10 POINTS AHEAD.];W[qk];B[rj];W[qj]
;B[rh];W[pl];B[pm];W[nh];B[le];W[rl];B[qm]LB[ol:A]C[IF I WERE WHITE I'D PLAY AT 'A'.]
;W[ri];B[qi]LB[ol:A]C[Tried this throw in to try to prevent white from making an easy eye.

THAT'S A USEFUL IDEA SOMETIMES, BUT WHITE HAS PLENTY OF SPACE TO MAKE EYES.

I WOULD PLAY AT 'A'.];W[pi]LB[ol:A][rk:B]C['A' IS URGENT AND MAKES TERRITORY.  WHEN YOU CAN, IF YOU CAN, A PLAY AT 'B' SAVES YOU AT LEAST ONE STONE.]
;B[sn]LB[rk:A]C[Decided to rather cut of the possible connection to the lower group like this.

OK, BUT YOU COULD ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING AND SAVE STONES BY PLAYING 'A'.]
;W[sp];B[rg]LB[lc:a]TR[qh][ph][pi][pj][qj][qk][nh][pl]C[Realised that the white group (marked) will probably live anyway.

YES.

So rather tried to end the exchange in sente so that I could split the top two groups with a move like 'a'.

YES, WORTH A TRY.];W[sj];B[sl];W[rk]C[NOW WHITE HAS 2 EYES, YOU NOTICE.]

;B[nb];W[ib];B[ie];W[ke];B[lf];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea];B[hb];W[kf]
LB[ia:a]C[Noticed that white was running to save his group and that he did not notice that he could make two eyes by playing at 'a'. Thus tried to cut him off, prevent his second eye and capture.]
;B[kh];W[ff];B[ge]C[Was very concerned for my group in top left.]
;W[jh];B[jf];W[kg];B[jg];W[lh];B[je]LB[ia:1];W[ki];B[kd]
(;W[ha]C[This move by white gave me the opportunity to prevent him from making a second eye.]
;B[ia];W[ld];B[rp]LB[kl:C][ml:B][ol:A]C[Wasn't 100 percent sure if this ko threat was sufficient.

LATER ON I WILL DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF 'A'.  

IT'S A GOOD KO THREAT BUT IF YOU HAD PLAYED AT 'A' ALREADY, YOU WOULD HAVE SEVERAL *HUGE* KO THREATS AVAILABLE BY  EXTENDING TO 'B' AND 'C', BOTH ENLARGING YOUR TERRITORY (LOWER RIGHT CENTER) AND REDUCING WHITE'S TO THE LEFT.]
;W[rq];B[kd];W[ma]LB[bg:a]C[I think white light have had a better ko threat at 'a'. Couldn't find any other significant ko threats for white or black.]
;B[ld];W[na];B[hg]LB[ml:B][ol:A]MA[od][pc][ob][nc][na][ma][ka]
[lb][kc][jd][jc][jb][ha][ib]C[I think this was a crucial move to make sure I have two eyes.

YES, BUT THE WHITE STONES ARE EFFECTIVELY DEAD.  SO I'D SAY LET WHITE MAKE A LITTLE TERRITORY HERE AND YOU MAKE BIGGER TERRITORY WITH 'A' .  WHEN WHITE CONNECTS, YOU PLAY 'C'.]

[lb][ma][nc][ob][na][pc][od]C[NOT NECESSARY.  WHITE'S MARKET STONES ARE EFFECTLIVELY DEAD WITH PROPER PLAY WITH BLACK.

YOU NEED TO PLAY 'A' AND MAKE TERRITORY WHERE MARKED.

NOTICE THIS ALSO MAKES IT HARDER FOR WHITE TO BUILD TERRITORY ABOVE 'A', WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE GAME AS PLAYED.]
;W[lk]LB[ol:A]C[WITH THIS MOVE, WHITE IS ABLE TO ENCROACH ON THE TERRITORY YOU COULD HAVE SECURED WITH 'A'.

THIS IS VERY BIG FOR WHITE, MAYBE ALMOST BIG ENOUGH TO CANCEL OUT BLACK'S LEAD.]
;B[ml];W[mk];B[nl];W[nk];B[ll]LB[km:a]C[It might have been better to play at 'a'.

NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.  THERE IS GIVE & TAKE IN EVERY GAME.  YOU MADE A FEW MISTAKES, AS POINTED OUT, BUT STILL OUTPLAYED WHITE. AS I SUSPECTED,  IT WAS A TERRITORIAL AS OPPOSED TO FIGHTING GAME DUE TO THE LACK OF SHARP ATTACKS, INVASIONS, ETC. IN THE OPENING STAGES.

TO SUMMARIZE, MY MAIN CRITIQUES WOULD BE: (1) OPENING DEVELOPMENT, (2) FAILING TO PLAY WHERE WHITE PLAYED ON MOVE 68; (3) FAILING TO PLAY 'A' ON MOVE 137.

ON THE OTHER HAND YOUR MOVE 93 WAS VERY SMART, KILLING WHITE'S CHANCES TO MAKE LIFE ON TOP.

OVERALL IT WAS A NICE WIN FOR BLACK.   NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF AT YOUR 15K LEVEL!]
