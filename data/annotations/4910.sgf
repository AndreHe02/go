C[Hello, and first of all thanks for reviewing my game.
This time I played black and tried to make territory in the
center while containing white on the borders/corners. It
seems i've not been aggressive enough, as i couldnt get
his territory smaller.
I believe i didnt make any huge mistake defending the
center but please correct me if i'm wrong.

Thanks again ! :)

maybe the shape looked nice.

That's exactly what I would do.  You've confined C14 very nicely, and are at t
he same time putting pressure on D10.  White definitly spread himself too thin
, you did good by cashing in on this.];W[ef];B[ff];W[ee];B[fe]

(;B[ed]C[I would recommend D17 instead.  White doesn't have enough room to stay al
ive, so just keep yourself safe.  You're being too aggressive here, and have l
eft C16 alone.  Now he can counterattack.];W[ce];B[dc];W[bd]

 is all about trading.];W[kb];B[me];W[gb];B[ic];W[ib];B[hc]

this is a tricky part of the game.  White's definity go the territory advantag
e, but moves like B4 could cut into it, and O3 could help you start building s
ome secure stuff of your own.  On the other hand, your H4 move is appealing be
cause its making use of that big wall you have on the top of the board, you're
 trying to use your influence to cash in big in the center.

I can't honestly say what's best, if you try for territory you help your oppon
ent fortify his position, making it tougher for you to grab the center.  On th
e other hand, you're spread pretty thin right now, and have plenty of holes.  
Its a style thing, go with your strength.];W[hq];B[hn];W[ip]
;B[io];W[jp];B[jo]SQ[dg][jj][qn][bp]C[This move is too slow, its worth very little and now your opponent ha
s the initiative.  Secure the top left, and start putting pressure on D10 inst
ead.  Or go for a completly different part of the board.];W[bq]
C[I didnt understand his move, i was sure he could get far
more of the corner than what is aimed at right now
--------
It is a strange move, if you want the bottom left why not go for B4 instead, i
ts actually more secure that way.  Also, there's plenty of other good places t
o go for, your opponents not thinking big enough, make him pay :)]
;B[kp]C[This isn't ambitious enough, you're not going to strengthen your cent
er by running along the bottom, he's the one really benefiting.]

loose much of the center if i went more ahead in his moyo.
What was the best play at this point ? (i though i was
winning at this point, was I ?)
-----
Be more agressive in securing the center, and play higher up.  N10 for example
.  You're only winning if you can secure all of the center, so you need to mak
e that your main goal.];W[pm];B[ph]SQ[nj]C[I'd take care of the center first, you've got a huge hole in your def
enses right now.];W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[rg]

----------------------
Its not that you're too close to him, its that you're too close to your weakes
t area, the top left.  Check out some of the other moves I suggested back when
 you played F10.];W[ej];B[fi];W[dg];B[eh];W[dh]

------------------
Games are always tough when you've got to secure the center, because you've got to think big.  The key is to use any move they play to secure your position, don't worry if they're getting territory because you're getting more.  I hope this review helps, if you have any questions let me know:
