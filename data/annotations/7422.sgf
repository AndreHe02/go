C[forfun (hereafter "ff") - Thanks for presenting us with an interesting game for analysis.  In this game Black never seemed to be able to get traction and lead the way.  Early on White gained the initiative and did not let go.  This is an unfortunate but frequent occurance for all of us when we face stronger players.  Our opponents have a nasty tendency to demonstrate a slightly better understanding of the situation on the board and use that to turn aside what we think are our best punches! :-)

In order to improve our games, however, it is of little use admiring our opponents' plays.  Rather we have to dig into our own and consider where and how we should have played better. Let's see what that means in this game...]
;B[dp];W[pq]
(;B[qd]C[ff - If we compare this game against the pros, we can see that this is a rare (but not unknown) choice at the professional level.  Playing in the upper right is one common idea.  However, the most frequent choice is Q17, the so-called "opposing komoku".   See the variations.]
;W[dd]
(;B[cf]C[ff - Fundamentally, a stone on 4-4 finishes the corner in one play.  It is stable and symmetrical.  In contrast, a stone on 3-4 only half finishes the corner.  It is asymmetrical and the next play in the corner is very important for determining who gets the most value in the area.

In this situation, the upper left and lower left are less urgent than the upper right and lower right.  Either continuing against the bottom right or enclosing the upper right would be more typical ideas.

If Black plays against the upper left, the play at F17 would build a connection to the "hot" corner in the upper right.  The play at C14 should be used only as a probe.  See the variations...]
;W[fc]
(;B[bd]C[ff - Years ago Black could count on White answering this play at C17 most of the time.  Modern go is different.]

(;W[cg]C[ff - This is unusual.  Normally White attaches here when the bottom left corner is a White stone.]

(;B[df]C[ff - This should be at D13. D14 is too conservative. See the variations.]
;W[bf];B[cc];W[dc];B[be];W[bh];B[dg];W[ci];B[af];W[bg];B[ce]
;W[ic]
(;B[oc]C[ff - This is the wrong direction.  Once White plays at J17, the top becomes uninteresting. The urgent question now is on the left side. Black should attack the White stones. See the variations]
;W[cn]C[ff - White is very happy to get the opportunity to play first on the left side.]

(;B[cp]C[ff - A very tough play but it assumes that Black can profitably invade the left side.  This is not likely here. See the variation.]
;W[fq]C[ff - Now Black's corner stones may become threatened.]
;B[cl];W[en]
(;B[fp]C[ff - Black can not decide which side to play on and goes back and forth.]
;W[dk]
(;B[bn];W[bo];B[co];W[bm];B[dn];W[cm]
(;B[dm]C[ff - This gives up the left side.  See the variation...]
;W[dl]
(;B[bl]C[ff - Black plays this and seals off the corner.  However, White gets to play the atari at E7 along the way. This does not look good for Black.]
;W[an];B[al];W[em]C[ff - Ouch, that hurts! :-)];B[do];W[am]

(;B[ap];W[bp];B[bq];W[bk];B[aq];W[ck];B[gq];W[qo];B[qj];W[mc]
;B[nq];W[ql]
(;B[oj]C[ff - This looks "normal".  But is it?  Where is Black's next play going to be that will make good use of this stone?  

On the upper side, Black looks at invading at L17.  In that case if White and Black move out into the center together, White has an easy invasion of the right because the gap between R10 and R16 is too wide.

On the bottom right, there is no interesting invasion point that will make use of P10.  Black needs a different plan here.  See the variations...]
;W[rd]C[ff - Good timing.]
(;B[re]C[ff - This seems like one way to reply.  See the variation also.]
;W[qe]
(;B[rf]C[ff - A passive response.  Can Black afford to play this low (and slow) stone? See the variations.]

(;W[qh]C[ff - Undoubtedly White played S16 expecting to play this invasion.  However, Q16 looks like the better way to punish Black S14 here.  See the variation...]
;B[pd];W[rj]
(;B[rk]C[ff - The exchange that results here seems to leave White in the lead. White's original position in the lower right is low. It is not so interesting for Black to try to push into it with an even lower group.

This seems like a key point in the game. Black should target to build the bottom on a large scale. See the variation.]
;W[qk];B[ri];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi]
(;B[sj]C[ff - This is a classic bad play.  Black captures before White threatens anything. As a result, White never plays S12 and Black falls behind.  Black takes a few points on the second line while White builds a wall on the outside that decides the game. See the variations.]
;W[oh];B[rl];W[qm]
(;B[ro]C[ff - This seems off the mark.  In the game, Black attaches at R3 next.  What would happen if Black played there directly without exchanging S5 for S6?]
;W[rn]C[ff - This stone gives White the placement at T8.  As a result, S12 may become a forcing move if there is later fighting in the upper right.]
;B[qq]
(;W[qp]C[ See the variations.];B[pr];W[qr];B[or];W[rq];B[kp]
;W[no]C[ff - Unfortunately this threatens to invade the lower side while starting to build center territory.]
;B[kc];W[ob];B[pb];W[me]
(;B[pg]C[ff - Black can not turn aside like this.  The stone at L17 absolutely has to escape if there is to be any hope in the game.]
;W[og]C[ff - White demonstrates a better grasp of the whole-board situation than Black.]

(;B[ph]C[ff - Black decides to take one stone in gote.  Effectively the game ends here :-)]
