;B[qd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking into my game. It was played on Tygem on standard (20 min+3*30 sec byoyomi) time control, although my opponent used a total 5 minutes of his time. That was one of the things I found rather shocking, is that he could beat me with such ease without thinking for even one moment let alone reading. I don't know for sure where I went wrong either. I hope you can point out how I lost this game by so much in the end. Also sorry for submitting such a boring game. In fact I usually like peacefull games and don't get to play them much, so I was rather pleased at first when I saw what my opponent was doing after the weird opening. However this was the first peacefull game I ever lost. In your comments please try to focus on general principles and common shapes. Also please try to correct or validate my comments about the game, as it's revealing my thinking process that needs to improve.

Hi adomasu,

Thanks for sending your game in to review.

I was a little hesitant about accepting a review as I have been playing only a little for the last two years.  However I used to be 3-4 dan on Tygem so hopefully I can remember enough to still make it a useful review.

My standard way of reviewing games is to go through them once relatively quickly and present the comments I have as I play through, and then go back and add additional comments with the benefit of hindsight.   I do it that way because the later comments are always much more useful but I want to highlight things that I only saw on the review.

Also I would note that people who are stronger a) have a extremely good sense of who is winning and losing and b) can play exceedingly fast as a result.  So having not seen a single move by your opponent I'm guessing they're a sandbagger with a 3k account for relaxing.

--
Comments after a second -- are from me reviewing the game with the benefit of hindsight.

Thinking about it now I don't think your opponent was a sandbagger.  In many ways I feel you beat yourself - a few key mistakes were simply too expensive.  It's really hard to completely eliminate those mistakes from your play but with a bit of luck you should be able to identify them as mistakes shortly after you've played them and then sacrifice them quickly.  I think that small change will make a big difference for you.]
;W[qp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce];W[fc]C[Wery weird move. No idea what to do here. In particular I have no idea what exactly that threatens in the corner. I was considering H17 but that seemed too dangerous. I try to attack from afar. However my move is clearly wrong.
--
Ok, F17 is clearly a mistake/overplay.  Your top left is strong so you can easily pincer it, force it to run and you should get good profit.

I'd be tempted by a loose pincer - inviting it to settle awkwardly.  Basically I'm worried my opponent will spot they made a mistake and counter pincer, at which point the aji of F17 becomes irritating.  Instead I'd rather encourage F17 to form a group and make the mistake bigger.

Especially this early in the game you don't need to play a particularly severe response.]
;B[jc]C[--
Right - very similar thinking to me.

I would have actually gone at L17 instead.  If white settles with J17 then you can jump to L15 and you're pretty happy.

If white doesn't settle then you can continue at H17, at which point it suddenly becomes severe.]

(;W[id]C[this is very unexpected. I try to patch up the right corner rather than extend up.
--
No, that feels pretty natural to me.  I'd be happy to see this as black.

You've got two choices, both of which are good.  J17 emphases the attack and K16 the upper right.  The way I'd choose between them is think about what happens if white doesn't play along.

Say you played K16 and instead of the natural J15, white plays J17 - would you be happy with the small heavy white group? I would.

Say you played J17 and instead of the natural H16, white plays K16, would you be happy continuing with H16 and fighting? I would.

So I feel either move is good and it's a matter of style.  I would personally play K16 and be very happy.]
;B[nc]C[--
I really don't like this move.  While locally it's fine/good, I feel like you've let all the pressure off white and now don't have a weak group to attack.  I don't feel you got enough compensation for white's overplay.

That said it does have a couple redeeming factors.  After white answers (probably with J17), your shape there is pretty good - you could even tenuki to say Q7 and work out how to use K17 later.]
;W[qf]C[white continues in the same fashion. Once again I have no idea what exactly this threatens in the corner. As I still think white is the overplaying style, I try to fix the weakness in the corner.
--
Absolutely white is overplaying - it worked out well last time, why change? :)

But I think it's a bit more than that.  White is also playing quite a sabaki style.  Keep it light and form groups anywhere.  This will normally lead to a fighting game where both players get very few points (<50 each)]
;B[pe]C[--
Locally fine but since you already have K17 I would much prefer J17.  For a start I'm sure you'll get a response.]
;W[re]C[here I decide that playing S17 is too slow.
--
Absolutely!  And locally you'd play S16 anyway

I'd still J17.  Apart from that I find splitting the right side pretty interesting, or the lower site.]
;B[jd]C[--
This seems fine too - though I feel you're a bit too territory focused.  You have 5 stones there and they've practically created 20 points of territory - that's very unusual for move 13.  I'm worried white will lightly threaten your territory and build outside thickness.]
;W[ie];B[ic]C[this move is  too slow. White should probably turn.
--
Both of you played fine.  White will probably continue at G16 since there's no serious attack against J17.  You could have played H18 instead - that would be a little interesting given F18 works.]

(;W[gd]C[This move is waay too slow.
--
Hehe :)

No it isn't.  See variation];B[je]C[--
Now, this is a slow move :)

Try L14 instead.  I'm also wondering about L13];W[rc];B[if]
C[--
yeah.

I would have pushed once at S16 first just to cut eyespace.  Say you play S16 first and then this sequence, and finish in sente - you'd be able to continue at R18 and white would probably not get an eye in the corner.]
;W[hf]C[I play double hane. might be too agressive, as white is basically alive already.
--
Double hane is good.  What you're trying to do here is force white to form eyes rather than run.  If you can do that then you should create good outside thickness.

I would also consider the cut, but probably settle on the double hane - see variation]

(;B[hg];W[gf];B[gg]C[hoping for something like influence. In this game influence meant nothing though.
---- 

Right - it is really interesting to look at this position having reviewed the game.

You've got a great wall facing half the board... but in the game that did not turn into a decent attack on white later (or points). 

So... is the wall wrong, or how you used it?  Or in other words, was it a mistake to make it?  I think the wall is ok and the problem is later than this.]

(;W[ff]C[white doesn't even cut, which seems quite severe actually.
--
Cut isn't severe.

The K15 etc stones are 100% save and do not need a defending move after the cut.  So that leaves H13.  That stone is facing a wide open centre and so not at all worried. Also a cut will create a weak cutting stone at the same point as white is not 100% alive.]
;B[ch]C[trying to not get sealed in the corner, hoping to relieve some aji there. Probably still a bit slow.
--
I don't really like it.  It's ok though.

I would have pushed white one more, probably with the keima to E12.  Then I would have played probably C13 depending on how white approaches the corner]
;W[fg]C[I decide that hane is dangerous and doesn't give me any clear benefit.]
;B[rd]C[Not sure why I made this exchange.
--
It is odd timing but fine - see earlier commentary on it];W[sd]
;B[op]C[--
Woah, what!

That's unexpected :)

I had thought you'd follow up with say P13 or G11];W[pq]C[This seems like a remarkably decent move, considering that it's almost never played.. not sure how to respond.
--
I don't see why white would play it here.  

There are lots of joseki on it since it was fashonable 100 years ago or so... However assuming you're not the sort of person that has memorised old joseki, what's wrong with just P3 and settle on the lower side?  White will jump somehow probably and you can settle.

If white pincers instead then R5 becomes pretty natural for you, white crosscutting would be an overplay.]
;B[oq];W[qm]C[this seems a bit thin. Hard to take advantage of though. I extend to the left first.
--
Right, Q5 or R6 feel more expected but I think it would take quite a few support stones before you can actually punish it.  For example if you had a stone at R9 then S5 works
--
Something I'm just noticing looking later is that after this move white is sitting pretty well on the right.  The R14 group is safe on its own due to S17.  The lower right group will always be safe.  Because of that white has two ways of reducing the central influence which largely nullifies it.  Say you get sente here and play R9.  White is likely to protect somehow (S7?) and you can then jump to R12 - that feels like the most you can get out of the aji on the right.  

I hadn't spotted during the initial review how the strength of white on the right neturalised the wall.]
;B[kq]C[--
A bit slow I think, but ok]
(;W[cm];B[qo]C[trying to exploit white's thin shape.
--
This is classic ajikeshi.  You can't really punish white yet and this move forces white to settle.  Far better to ignore it for now if you can't see how to punish.]

(;W[ro];B[qn]C[--
Ouch no :)

That's just horrble shape for you :)

Q5 and force white to S6 - don't take your own liberty without compensation.]
;W[rn];B[pp];W[qq];B[pm];W[pl]C[this seems to have backfired.
--
Yup :)

Most of it was R6.  It's not too bad - just throw those two stones away and the moyo starts to look interesting.]
;B[ql];W[rm]C[----

Ok here in hindsight let's think about things...

Do you think you can save R8 without Q7 dying in the process?  This is actually the question I asked on the variation for the next move in the initial read through, but it feels more critical now.  If you can save R8 then it would be very easy to cramp out the lower right and get good benefit from your wall.  Remember white needs to be vaguely worried about eyes in the upper right due to e.g. R18 or even S18 if black gets stronger locally... so white cannot respond too agressively to black threatening to enclose the central area.

Say you played Q9 now, I think you would be in a great position.]

(;B[om]C[----
In many ways i think this is the losing move.  After here white can push you around locally in a way that neutralises your wall.  Then the game comes down to points and white's a small amount head.  It would take something special for you to catch up after this.]
;W[ol]C[pretty badly...
--
yup, when you make a mistake it's often easiest to get out of it by throwing some stones away.  Rescuing mistakes is really painful]
;B[nl]C[overplay.
--
Yes and no.  You do have L3 and saving R6 is nothing.  I think I would have played this.  Basically you are trying to reverse the mistake from R6.]
;W[oj]C[white again responds in the calmest fashion possible.
--
Well, white's pretty happy! :)

It's hard for you now, do you continue with O9 which will settle that shape, or dive into Q12?  I would play O9 myself]
;B[ph]C[----
In hindsight this is a good move and just about got you back in the game.

If you can either isolate P8 and attack it, or isolate the upper right and attack it, then you'd be sitting pretty well.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[qi];B[pj];W[nk]C[--
That went well :)

You've essentially ensured the right side is not too big, only 3rd line territory.]

(;B[pk]C[--
Better to leave that unplayed - it doesn't outright save R8 and too much chance you will want the snapback threat instead.

One problem you've got is you can't threaten the snapback since white capturing O8 favours white way too much - shown in variation]
;W[ok]C[hoping to attack white.]
(;B[qj]C[--
but after O8 is captured white is too strong.  I think instead play N8 and try to form a moyo on the lower right.  If white overplays in response and tries to reduce _then_ you can play something like this and suddenly white is in trouble.

That said, as I'm writing this I'm starting to change my mind.   Cutting off the white group in the side starts to make R18 work again... Hmmm, no, I'd still N8.]
;W[pg]
(;B[nh]C[--
I would have played P13 - see var];W[nm]C[this is hard to fix.
--
Well yes and no.

It comes down to what your plan is and why you chose R10 instead of N8.  To me that plan says attacking the R12 group is juicy, and you don't realy mind white living with P8 easily.

Given that plan you could even tenuki here, or else O6 seems fine.]
;B[on]C[this seems suboptimal.
--
Yeah,  you've played I don't know 4 moves? that are suboptimal beause of the R6 mistake.

Those two stones are _nothing_!  White R4 is safe, White S5 is safe.]
;W[nn];B[no]C[white gets two stones endgame profit.];W[ml];B[og]
C[connecting my group and building the top right.
--
Right, good];W[pb];B[qc]C[--
ajikeshi again

Yeah there is a weakness there, but there are other ways to exploit it and this forces you to this way.]
;W[qb];B[fq]C[this is a critical point in the game. White doesn't seem like he can be attacked and I try to take big points, however white plays a great shoulder hit now and I respond too passively, maybe thinking I'm actually ahead since white can't really make points in the middle. The cuts at J13 should be worrying, but white never tried them..
--
ok, let's step back for a minute

F3 feels quite nice locally - reducing white's corner and expanding from L3.

You have a moyo in the centre / upper portion of the board but it won't turn into 100+ as white has reductions from Q18 and O9.

You also have C9 which is straight points but feels like the wrong direction of play.

H17 doesn't feel like it is threatening death, so let's rule that out.  

F12 is tempting but again it feels like your attack would peter out.

That leaves white's O9 group.  It's clearly alive as it virtually already has an eye, but it doesn't have two yet.  

So...

I would play N10 and force white to make the two eyes, hoping to build a decent territory while white defends.  Ideally you would get N10, N9, M6 - though white is unlikely to be quite that passive
--

Again revieiwng with hindsight.

It's pretty clear here that the central area is not that big.  Maybe 20 points?  You can't block off Q18 well even if you play there first, and you still have weakensses around say J13.  White will have to get at least one of those two, and probably both.

Your lower side is looking pretty small right now - so you convered just about all of it to territory from here.

The top left is looking ok but small.  C9 is looking huge for you.  Note that white can invade the top left at any time but unless F13 is stronger it doesn't feel like it is worth that much.

So... you don't have many points but that this point neither does white.  White has the lower right and upper right corner, a couple in the middle, a couple around F13, and C4 is bound to turn into a few.  Maybe 35 safe points and a little aji?

So overall point wise the game is currently still quite close.  The main problem for you is that white's groups are safer than yours so you're going to have a harder time than white using your influence to create points over the remander of the game.

Also worth noting that I said by move 90 the game was over.  But at move 70 it doesn't feel over.  I think that's quite important - you're behind sure, but while the midgame is over and we aren't settled into yose, it's still winnable.]
;W[jp]C[excelent move.
--
Hmm, it's fine but you weren't planning to form a huge lower moyo there as white alread has O6 etc.  So if you just play along it seems fine for you]
;B[jq];W[ip]C[I just can't think of anything better to do than take third line territory. White would cut off F3 and attack it otherwise.
--
I'd just take the cash.  If you play L4 then cutting off F3 is too hard for you to manage and anyway L4 is too close to O5]

(;B[iq]C[--
I would have done a one space jump];W[hp];B[hq]C[--
This feels odd - you already have L3 so G3 feels more natural than H3]
;W[fp];B[gp]C[--
This move feels wrong - I would have played the hane on the other side.  This will settle white and while you've got quite good territory for it, I would hate to miss out on the attack]
;W[go];B[gq];W[hn]C[at this point the game might be about even.
----
Ok let's evaluate

White's now destroyed any central influence you might have had but in exchange given you solid 3rd line territory

You now have 20 points on the lower side which combined with the upper side actually puts you ahead on straight points.  As per before, the problem for you is that white's shape is very close to creating more points in a number of places while yours is much more easily reduced.]

(;B[mo]C[very slow move.
--
No kidding!

Right idea to split white here, but you need to tolerate being invaded more.  Say you had played I don't know L5... let's look at var

--
In hindsight, it's these kinds of moves that cost you the game.  You're behind and you need to be pushier :)]
;W[dq]C[--
That sure is big, but a) now you can split white, and b) C9 is big too.]

(;B[ep]C[--
Doesn't feel as interesting right now];W[fo];B[eq]C[bad gote exchange.]
;W[cj]C[white gets the last big point. Now white is winning.
--
Yeah, by taking E3 over C9 what you're saying is that it is an urgent point.  I.e. you can punish white for the tenuki and so get profit equal or more than C9.  For example say you split white agressively - maybe even L6? Now that you've got E3/E4 in place that starts to work a bit better.

--
In hindsight it feels really hard for you to win now.  White has turned the lower left from good potential but no points into almost guaranteed 20 points.  In exchange you've got a reduction opportunity starting from E4, but we hadn't counted anything there as white's anyway so it won't affect our counting.

If you were to passively protect with say B12 now then it would change the effect of C16 a bit.  However I don't think it would be enough to win.]
;B[hi]C[trying to largen my territory while taking care of the cuts.
--
Locally G11 is better but globally this feels like accepting a loss

As you've said white just took the last big point.  If you don't get something in compenesation then it's over.
--
In hindsight this move is not attacking a white group, it's trying to turn moyo into points.  We've done that arithmetic, and it gives white the win.  To win from here you'd need to be more creative - attacking a group and it working out unusually well.]
;W[fi];B[ki]C[this might be wrong direction.
--
yeah, feels like you're just collecting points with no real regard for sente.

White can settle the two weakish groups, or outright attack]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[oc];B[od];W[mb]
(;B[lc]C[maybe I should hane here.
--
Yes, you're just giving (6?) points away];W[cd]C[this is the point where the deal was sealed. If white lives here I'm lost. And he did live. Is this the correct way to take advantage of the aji in the corner for white?
--
White _will_ get something from this move.  Your C12 is too far away to kill, especially when white is strong all around.]
;B[dd];W[cc]C[I don't know what to do here.
--
Hane at C18 feels best.

In other situations you'd descend to B15 but here you have C12 and your biggest weakness is the D17 stones, so play the hane.]

(;B[be];W[db]
(;B[eb]C[I thought white would go for the ko, which probably means I'm loosing anyway since I don't really have threats.
--
yeah, maybe - J17 becomes helpful for you.  Anway you're behind, you need a strategy to catch up, not a strategy to avoid falling further behind :)]
;W[da]C[this though... seems to just live, as I have to connect.]

(;B[ec];W[bb];B[ac];W[ab];B[ba];W[ca]C[white lived in sente, since I have to fix D15 and the game is lost. The rest of the game is not included, as nothing really happens. I hope you can tell me where I went wrong. I assume the reaction to the shoulder hit was too passive, but I don't really see an alternative. Shoulder hits aren't something I get to respond much; normally people try to invade everywhere and live of cut and kill everything, instead of reducing. Once again, thank you for your time. Looking forward to your response.
--
Ok.

Fundamentally I liked a lot of your play.  However you had a few mistakes that after playing you sort-of clung to and effectively made them worse.  

If you look now, where is your territory?  There's a few points in the upper middel and the lower side is large.   That's it!
At the same time white has all four corners and a few points elsewhere.

So... Let's go back and, with the benefit of hindsight, look at how some of the moves panned out. I feel like the game was over by move 90 (after you played L11).  Had you taken the key point of C9 instead of E4 then it still looks possible for you to win.  I think that makes evaluating the value of sente as the game progresses a key point.  I'm going to go back and review now with the benefit of hindsight.
--
Ok, thanks for sending your game in for review.  I found it very interesting.  You played a lot of good moves but were let down by a few small, slow ones.

Because white can't cut, white will probably go here directly.   Compared to the game line this means you have fully sealed the central area off and so will get an extra 10 or so points there, maybe more.  Realistically I don't think that on its own would be enough to win.]
