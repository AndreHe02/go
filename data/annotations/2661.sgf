Hi,

I reviewed your game, and I hope that my comments are of some use for you.

ug: I don't think this is a big mistake. Of course, white could have played at E16 instead, but this is ok, too.]

(;W[cg]C[ug: This, however, doesn't look good. You give black a big corner, and the extension to C13 is not worth so much for white, since white was already very strong there before. Compare this with the variations.]
;B[ed];W[jm]C[ug: It is very hard to attack this black stone, because there is a lot of space around. Maybe white should first play at the top. N16 or M17 look possible.]
;B[bm];W[bl];B[co];W[dl]C[ug: Again, a bad exchange for black.]
;B[hk];W[jk];B[hi]
(;W[ji];B[hg];W[jg]C[ug: Black escaped easily, and it's not clear how white can use the strength he built up. Thus I am not sure whether white's attack can be called a success.]

ug: A big mistake indeed. Still, black wins only by 1.5 points, so you can see from that, how much white was ahead.
