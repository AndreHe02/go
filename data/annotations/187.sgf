;B[kd];W[nd]L[qj][jp][nq]C[a proverb says,  you should play where is the most space, i prefer one of the moves a,b or c]
;B[pf];W[nf];B[nc]C[black should  continue jumping, making white strong by attaching is not good.]
;W[mc];B[oc];W[md]L[ld]C[playing at 'a' makes him answer  locally, then you can go on jumping.]
;B[kf];W[ki]C[vague. why  not just 'a', this move invites him to cut by playing somewhere between.]
;B[qj];W[cl]L[jp]C['a' fits better to your moyo strategy.  your aim is attacking his invasion there, you can efficiently attack him.]
;B[fq];W[fo]L[ip][hq]C[this way you come in an overconcentrated  position. i think pincering is better. 'a' or 'b']
;B[hp];W[je];B[ke];W[kb];B[if]L[ic]C[better at 'a' and take  off white's base.]
