C[Hi, Xylol,

this is HonFu from the GTL. 

When I watched this game, I felt that both of you were confused sometimes about the proper directions or purposes of fighting, so I will focus a bit on this, on the question, what every fight is actually about.]

(;W[pp]LB[op:A]C[White A is more common

Hon: Let's not get into joseki details, where even professionals often disagree or change their minds later, but let's look instead at what happens in the big picture.

First of all we have to see that this is the first small "fight". What is it about? Your stone at Q6 is heavily outnumbered and has to settle somehow. In the process it is unavoidable that Black gets solidified somewhat at the bottom and at the upper right. (That's what the Kobayashi-fuseki is about after all.) You of course will try to get as much as you can here, but a local "loss" here is unavoidable and also natural. I mark the word "loss", because from a more "enlightened" perspective, it only looks like a loss - your opponent has invested more stones in the area, so obviously his stones should achieve more than yours, otherwise he would be cheated. 

I am telling you this, because in later comments you seem to judge your own positions too harshly.]
;B[qq];W[op];B[oq]
(;W[mp]LB[nq:A]C[White at A instead?

Hon: Looks like an overplay.];B[mq]
(;W[nq]C[Hon: I think here you missed a chance to get more!]
;B[nr];W[np];B[lq]C[Hon: Black can connect. If possible, I would like to prevent this.]

(;W[qp]C[Hon: This looks a bit slow to me. You already have a lot of strong shape, so what are you doing? Getting points? This is hardly to expect with R8 in place.]

(;B[rp]C[Hon: Black is playing endgame.];W[ro];B[rq];W[qj]C[Hon. Since your opponent played an unnecessary gote move, you get around to pincering the stone.]
;B[rn];W[pl]C[Hon: Black continues to overvalue small profits on the edge. I think if you can confine Black here, giving him a few points, getting strong on the outside, it will be a good result for you, because Black made just a few points on the 2nd and 3rd row, where he should have gotten a moyo or attack.]
;B[qh]
(;W[so];B[qk];W[pk];B[rj]
(;W[qm];B[pj];W[rl];B[rk]C[Hon: In this situation, if you don't connect, the atari didn't profit you.]
;W[oj];B[pi]
(;W[rm]TR[ok]C[Hon: I think, the center was more important.]

(;B[om];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn]C[overall, b got territory at bottom right and a strong group on the right

w got overconcentrated shape, maybe 11pts. blacks n6/n7 stones are virtually shutting w in and reducing the radiance.

Hon: I think, the overconcentration originated when you did not cut at the bottom. Also you could have avoided strengthening the R9 group. The N6 chain can still be separated later.]
;W[nc]LB[hq:A]C[I didnt think for long about this move. Maybe A instead?

Hon: I agree with this move. We're still in fuseki, you should take the large spots before invading.]

(;B[nd]C[Hon: I doubt that this is a good move. Black builds strength towards an area, that is tight and solid already, asking for overconcentration.]

(;W[od]LB[md:A]TR[jd]C[White should have played at A. I should wedge only if i have a stone around the marked place.

Hon: I have tried this wedge myself a few times - with little success. ;-)]

(;W[md];B[ne]
(;W[me]LB[lc:A];B[mc]
(;W[mb]LB[lc:A]C[Hon: Like this, you make your result worse than it should have been, trying to live by any means with your surrounded stones, crawling on the second line, almost killing your stones in the center.]
;B[lc];W[pb]
(;B[pe]C[Hon: This looks too careful to me.];W[lb]C[Hon: Push once, so that Black can not block in sente ...]
;B[kc]
(;W[qc]
(;B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[oa]
(;B[rc]LB[mf:A]C[i think Black A would have been better, to place a strong group facing in the middle but giving up the points on the side.

Hon: But A isn't even fully capturing the two stones, and the corner is big. After playing Q15, this looks natural to me. Black can fight it out with the two white stones.]
;W[mf];B[hc];W[fc]C[Now white can try to hunt for the H17 group and gain something while doing so.

Hon: You can not overestimate the prospects, because White's stones around N14 are also weak.]

(;B[jd]C[Hon: This looks slow.

It looks like Black is defending points. Since L18 is open, there are no points.]

(;W[jb]LB[jf:A]C[White A instead?

Hon: I agree. Attack from where you are weak, not from where you are strong. 

Also normally you attack from the outside, aiming to confine a group. Coming in like that is rarely the most effective way to go.]
;B[jf];W[lh];B[nh]C[Hon: Now Black is doing the same - attacking from where he is already strong. 

We should play, were there is weakness, not where there's strength!]

(;W[mi]LB[lg:B][mg:A]C[White N11 protects against the cut at A but the second i played it i realised the cut at B is possible.

I think white should simply connect at B.

Hon: Yes, with the keima, you always have to check both cutting points.]

(;B[hf];W[ke]TR[lg]C[White is protecting the marked cutting point.

Hon: But now it is not sente anymore.]
(;B[jc]C[Hon: This looks strange. Was it really necessary?]

(;W[ff];B[kb];W[dj]LB[hq:A]C[w lets black live but tries to take points at left side. maybe an invasion at A is still the better option.

Hon: You played F14 and let Black live, so if this is supposed to have a meaning, a follow-up on the left side looks logical.

Also, just looking at the idea, it is a good way to attack, because while you attack the top, you get to play stones on the developable left side. When attacking, you should always look on "the other side" of the attack, where you want to profit. When there is no "other side", then often it is best not to attack, or at least not now.

Only problem in this position is that it turns out to be still rather open and Black finds a way in.

Personally I would have just gone with C15 in the first place. Call me lazy, but you got what you got.]
;B[be]
(;W[bd];B[ce];W[cd];B[ch]
(;W[bi]LB[ci:A]C[I think white A would have been the better sequence.

Hon: Hard to tell which is better.];B[ci];W[cj];B[bh];W[bj]
;B[eh]C[Hon: You got your corner solidified and also the left side. 

From here on it is hard to really profit more from an attack (unless you kill, but the top group is hard to threaten now), because the whole area is largely played out. Probably this is not a bad moment to tenuki and decide what to do in the lower left.

Or separate with one move, then tenuki.]
(;W[gh];B[fi];W[ib]LB[fk:A][hq:B]C[Here i decided it is time to revive this stone and attack the black group once more. maybe a play around A or B would have been better.

Hon: These things are not easy for me as well, but I think, your instinct, to play where it's "hot" (weak groups involved) instead of where it's "big", is generally correct.

But you also have to judge the prospects of the fight. If you are not confident to kill (which is most of the time), you need to think about how you want to profit from the fight. For example, if we just look at where you could still grow, a move at A looks more logical, developing the left side something more.]
;B[hb];W[ka];B[la];W[ma];B[ja];W[ia];B[ic];W[la];B[ha];W[ja]
;B[qa];W[pa];B[jh];W[gi]LB[eb:A]C[in this whole fight i didnt feel cmofortable, I think these kind of fights and running I have to practise.

Hon: Maybe your instinct told you, that your fight was not about the "right thing". Here you are splitting groups, as often we indeed should do, but where do you profit from it? The left side you already got, the right side is totally played out, the lower side can be entered anyway, if you attack or not.

If we start a fight, although we don't see how we can profit from it, rather than taking profit we often end up compromising our own position and lose points.

Your idea, F14, letting Black live but making two profitable moves in a row, that is the "gentleman way of attack". Even if the opponent lives, you already made a profit. In this situation, if you don't kill, what will you get? The risk of losing something is larger. I think this is where that uncomfortable feeling stems from!

For example you insisted on connecting the K18 stones, keeping the group eyeless. If you can get something from the attack or even kill, that is great. But if you don't get anything ... look at the point A. This is a nice endgame point for Black, and it has been made possible by H19. Okay, Black could always play that move; but by connecting your stones, you even gave it to him in sente. So you already lost something before you can start to aim at profiting from the attack.

I hope I am not overdoing it ... but here's a little "by the way". In Go, a move of "bad technique", a "vulgar move", is often described exactly like this - you give the opponent something (for example strengthen it), before you even know if you get something back. "Good technique", "tesuji", "honte" and the like is very often a move, where you first aim at getting something yourself (for example strength, territory, influence), without giving something to the opponent first. (Maybe Black Q17 earlier instead of attaching is an example - take something without giving something away volontarily.)]

End of comments.

Hon: Yeah, normally you just take an offered stone.];B[eg];W[gf]
;B[fk]
(;W[el]C[Hon: This move plays from the strong side again. Lefd side was not invadeable at the moment, so why defend there?]
;B[jj]
(;W[gk];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[hk]TR[fk][fl][gl]C[Hon: You are just "toothpasting" your opponent out between your stones. This is at best uneffective, at worst dangerous, because it's very bad shape to help the opponent to split your stones like this. Instead you should look for a way to surround the enemy groups.

Please just take a look how you hunt your opponent across the board without getting anything in the end.]

(;W[iq];B[dq]
(;W[ep]C[Hon: I think hoping for this group to die is unrealistic.]
;B[eq];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq]C[Hon: So basically what you did with your moves - you pushed both groups across the board, until they found eyes somewhere. To show for this, you only have J3, where you could have invaded anyway. 

On the other hand, you lost points in the corner here. 

Maybe in your future games you should be on the watch for the basic principles of fighting mentioned in this review.

1.) Attack (and obviously defend) from where you are weak, not from where you are strong. (Both of you made this mistake a few times.) 

2.) Attack to make a profit, not to kill. Your actions in the center could not profit you, because the paths both of you crossed while struggling, had been taken already, nothing changed due to all the fighting. Worse even - you played sequences which LOST you points instead of giving you any. If you don't see how to profit from an attack, then better don't attack, but play a profitable move, that threatens - even only slightly - to attack harder later. If the opponent defends, you get two moves in a row which is also fine.

3.) Try to obtain a realistic perspective on what you can actually achieve from a fight. This is also true when you are on the defending side - you should be happy if you get a solid, living shape. If the opponent gets some points in the process, this must not annoy you (because then you feel behind and start to overplay) - it is the natural thing to happen since he was in the area first!

I hope this review helped ... thanks for the opportunity and good luck with your go!]
