C[ts: Thank you for taking your time. I feel, this game is more or less
 even. There was time, when black (me) should have resigned, but then 
after mistake by white I returned to the game. I lost because of two 
blunders in a row, where there should be none. Naturally, there are 
many more, which I'm not aware of. I think, main theme of this game was
 attacking group without base. I settled quite quickly, but failed to 
attack white properly. Could you help me with that by pointing out my 
mistakes?

D: Hi. I'm Daniel, a 3k player from Germany. I'll try my best to analyse your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[qo]TR[nc][ce][de][ci][di][mp]
[gq]C[ts: I consider this approach a 
mistake, as white stone is already pincered.

D: Yes, this is very probably not the best way to play against the 
chinese fuseki. Other points, like the ones marked look bigger right now.]
;B[qp]C[ts:  I want to attack while making territory, but not kill, so 
I show clear way to escape.];W[pm]
(;B[po]C[ts: This is probably my first mistake. As I see it now, this 
move doesn't have good followup and unnecessarily strengthens white. Is
 it "thank you" move?

D: I think it is good.];W[qn]C[D: W is quite heavy now.]
(;B[pk]C[ts: To slow?

D: Yes, the other moves look better.];W[kq]TR[pm][qn][qo]C[D: It appears quite risky 
to leave the triangled group alone here. However, Q9 was not so severe 
as an attacking move, so it's not easy for B to find a punishment.]

(;B[nn]C[ts: Mistake? Extention at N3 better? Weak white group would be
 still atackable.

D: I think this is the wrong direction of attack. However, N3 
doesn't look so good either, as your corner is already pretty strong. I'd play either m4 or o8 (see variants).]
;W[nm];B[on];W[om]
(;B[mn]C[ts: Trying to get step ahead, but here I forgot, what was the 
plan - make terrritory, not kill.

D: I think the move is okay.];W[ll];B[nk]C[ts: Expand and threaten to cut.

D: Yes this is a very good move.];W[ml]
(;B[mm]C[ts: My plan here to safely extend further to the left. One 
point jump from two stones can't be cut, but maybe I should've extend 
by jumping two points (please see variation at 23)?

D: The exchange n7-o8 is just helping w, as it weakens o9. You can 
safely jump to l6 without the exchange. Later on in the game this exchange will be punished.]
;W[nl]
(;B[kn]
(;W[nq];B[rp]C[ts: Yes, B21 and B23 were mistake - I gave white sente 
and had to defend, where one move at N3 would be enough to secure 15 
points.

D: Not too bad I think. N3 is still possible.]
(;W[jl]
(;B[lp]C[ts: I felt good about this move...

D: I think this is a bad move. It helps W to eliminate the
 aji and doesn't get almost anything for it.  A "thank-you move". 
If you want to continue playing at the lower side, N3 looks much 
stronger (see variants).];W[lq]C[D: W is very lucky to get such an opportunity to fix his weakness!]

(;B[ko]TR[gd][nd][de][df][qf][iq]C[ts: but followed with slow move.

D: Other areas of the board are much more interesting now. B could 
play at one of the triangled points, for example.];W[ce]C[ts: And this is punishment for gote moves...

D: Yes, W is happy to get the shimari.];B[fq]
(;W[cn]TR[kq][lq][nq]C[D: A mistake by W. He shouldn't leave the l3 group weak like this]

(;B[iq]C[D: Good, attack L3! 
An alternative idea to consider would be J4, which would leave you with a stronger position even if you don't manage to kill, as the B groups would be able to connect.]
;W[jp]
(;B[in]C[D: "Play far from strong groups and close to weak groups." .....
L6 is strong, but j3 is weak. So this move appears to be in the wrong 
direction.];W[or];B[pr];W[ip]
(;B[dr]C[D: Don't let w get out that easily!];W[hq]
(;B[hr];W[ir];B[gq];W[hp];B[gr]C[D: Gote, ouch! Now, W is pretty muhc]
;W[cq];B[jr];W[is];B[hs];W[jq];B[cr]C[ts: I think, I'm settled now. Because 
opponent responded to all my moves (don't know if he couldn't tenuki), 
I see this as success. But this move is gote, am I right? If white 
tenuki now B at B3 whould be small.

D: I think this is good, as C2 would be sente for W. You don't want to 
have to play a move like f1.];W[br];B[fo]C[ts: Mistake by me. This is gote, as it doesn't attack any
 white stones. Whole sequence untill B61 shouldn't be played. As I 
don't see any way to attack white and all my groups are safe, I 
should've grabbbed big point. Am I correct?

D: I think this move is big. If w plays there you are locked in and 
probably even have to play f1 to live in gote.];W[en]
(;B[eo]C[ts: Intended this move as solid connection in sente (see var).
 But it hasn't good followups, as my opponent showed me.

D: Yes, this move is pointless. G6 would be a connection.]
(;W[fm];B[do];W[co]
(;B[dq];W[bq]
(;B[ep]C[ts: I'm connected, so this is passing move. I'm just 
frustrated because of several last moves and want to accomplish 
anything at all. Now I'm probably loosing.

D: Still, G6 looks like the move locally.]
(;W[cj]C[ts: This is wrong direction for white?

D: This move makes it very hard for B to invade the left side 
effectively. I wouldn't criticise it too harshly. However, the point h8
 looks extremely urgent.... (see comments in variants)]
(;B[mc]TR[hl]C[D: This is missing the important point again....]
;W[rd]C[ts: Is this normal invasion or mistake by white? I'm very
 weak at invasions...

D: I think this is possible.];B[qc];W[qf]
(;B[rh]C[ts: My mistake?

D: Yea, third line may be better to keep some of your territory as i 
don't think you can kill.];W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[ph]
(;B[rg];W[nh]SQ[pe]C[D: This move is not so good, I think. W should better try and stay connected, e.g. by playing q15.]
;B[qg]C[D: Good!];W[pi]C[D: A mistake, as this is not sente...]

(;B[qj]TR[rd][qf]C[D: This was your opportunity to capture the triangled stones...]
;W[nd]
(;B[nc]C[ts: I thought about B77 at Q14 (see var), but after W O17 I 
saw entire top left as white territory which would be hard to reduce. 
Now I see, that white has one killed group and two weak groups. During 
the game I imagined stones on their positions, but failed to judge 
strength of groups entirely.

D: I think the truth is in between your view in the game and your view 
now. O17 is definitely a big move, but q14 is as well.];W[od]
;B[oc];W[of]
(;B[pf]C[D: This move helps w to make shape.];W[pe];B[pg];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[og]C[D: W fixed all his weaknesses and can be happy with this outcome. Now, he is clearly leading the game.]
;B[oi]C[ts: I have read out sequence untill B93 from now and it was 
very good feeling;) During the game I thought, that only way to have 
chance in this game is to kill white middle group or make some 
territory at top left.];W[oj];B[pj];W[oh];B[nj];W[ni];B[ok]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[li];B[kj]C[ts: I'm aiming at cutting. But right now it would fail and I knew it.]

(;W[im];B[ij]C[ts: J6 is unimportant to me, so I was glad I could play 
B99, but cut still doesn't work.

D: W should now defend his shape.]
(;W[le];B[hm];W[hl]C[ts: White responded as I liked, now cut works! 
Moments like this are rewarding even if you still lose. But... As I see
 now, it still doesn't work - I still can't read that far ahead, so all
 my work was fruitless...

D: Yea, that's right, the position isn't easy to read.... But when you're behind it's sometimes a good idea to "shake" the game: Just steer the game into complications!]
;B[jm]
(;W[il];B[kl]C[ts: this shouldn't work with correct white play.]

(;W[jj]C[ts: Interesting thing is, that white made this mistake and now
 I returned to the game.

D: Yea, the right combination was easy to miss though. So you're lucky!]
;B[jk];W[ji];B[ik];W[mj];B[mk];W[lk];B[kk];W[gm];B[ii]TR[fc]
[kc][hn]C[D: I'd have played one of the marked moves instead.]
;W[gj];B[gi]TR[db][jc][kd][ee]C[D: This move just helps W to strenghten his moyo! Better just extend at the top, or if you feel brave invade properly at one of the marked points.]

[qq][rq][sq][er][qr][rr][sr][ds][es][gs][qs][rs][ss]C[ts: Liked this game. We both made many mistakes, during this 
review I saw some of them, perhaps you can help me with others? My main
 problem, I think, is playing small moves, when I'm already safe and 
can't threaten anything. What do you think?

D: Yea, it's a nice game! I'd sum up as follows:

You got quite a nice start, as W invaded too early against the chinese formation in move 6. However, then you wasted your (small) advantage by playing a few slow moves (11, 13) and finally the "thank-you-move" 27. Next, you took the opportunity of punishing a W mistake by the strong move 33, but unfortunately missed the right continuation (35), so W got out lucky. After you managed to live with your lower side group, H6 was a huge point that both players seemed to ignore (62 and so on..). However, W managed to invade the right side and get a living group, which was also very big. Now, W was quite a bit ahead, but still had a weak group on the right side. If W played carefully, this would not have been a problem for him, but he blundered and you took your chance. Now you were in the game again. However, in the endgame you played clearly too meek and also made some tactical mistakes, perhaps because you were still dazzled by your big gain on the right side?! :-)

I believe you can learn two things from this game:

1. When you play forcing moves don't just play them because you think that your opponent will answer. Play them only if the exchange really helps you. 21 and 27 are textbook sort of examples of forcing-moves that you should _not_ play!

2. Although I think you are tactically strong, you seem to miss the right direction of play quite often (13, 29, 35, 61, 75, ...). It helped me to regularly watch games of very strong players, at best professionals, to get a bit of a feel for this.

3. Even if you feel you made a huge gain (or also a huge loss), go on and play calmly the best moves that you can. This sort of discipline is really crucial in Go, and I think many games especially at our level are decided by these psychological factors.]
