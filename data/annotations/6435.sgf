C[First of all I want to thanks the reviewer in advance.

SC: I will place my initials before my comments.];B[cp]TR[dq]
SQ[dp]C[Just tryng a position I never tried before

SC: The 4x4 point (square) and the two 3x4 points (triangles) are all good places to start a corner with.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[de];B[io]TR[sq][rq][qr][qs][ik][ij][ji][ki][lj]
[lk][kl][jl]SQ[iq][kq][gq][fq]C[SC: This is too "high" for the opening.  "High" means closer to the center of the board and "low" means closer to the edge. In general, play your opening moves on either the 3rd line or the 4th line.  Playing roughly half of your opening stones on the 3rd line and half on the 4th line is also a good "rule of thumb".

This stone is too "high" to really control the lower side.  White could invade at any of the squares and should be able to make a live group.  If this stone was at J4, then only the F3 invasion spot would be workable for white.

While this stone doesn't control the lower side, it might be intended to move into the center.  That isn't really a good plan, however.

It is very difficult to make territory in the center of the board. This is because you need to surround all 4 sides, which takes a lot of stones.  It takes a minimum of 4 stones to surround 4 points of territory in a corner.  It takes a minimum of 8 stones to surround 4 points of territory in the center.  This means it takes twice as many moves, which gives white twice as many chances to mess things up.

So, don't waste much time on center territory, focus on the sides and corners.]
;W[ke];B[el]TR[qf][pj][qj]SQ[pd][pp]C[SC: This is also too high.  Another good idea for the opening is to find the largest gap between two stones and play in that gap.  The gap between the two marked stones is the largest by one intersection.  So a good move for black this turn would be any of the triangles.]
;W[ij];B[ok]C[SC: This is the end of the opening phase of this game.  The opening involves placing widely spaced stones to "sketch out" areas that each player would like to have for territory.

The middle game involves trying to secure and expand the territory you sketched out in the opening, while trying to reduce and invade your opponent's sketched out territory.  This is when the most attacking and killing of groups happens.

The end game involves filling in the final details of each player's territory.

These phases are not always clearly defined, so it isn't always easy to pick an certain move and say that is when the game moved to the next phase.]
;W[ek];B[gk]TR[dk][qk][iq][dc][gd][hd][hc][gc][dd]SQ[ek][ij]
C[SC: What is black's plan at this point?  You should have at least a general plan or goal in mind.  Otherwise you are just reacting to your opponent's moves. 

This move looks like black is trying to cut the two marked white stones into seperate groups and/or trying to push into the area around G13.  Neither of the marked white stones is weak.  This means that neither is in any immenent danger of being cut off and killed. So, cutting them apart doesn't accomplish much.  Also, white is not at all close to making real territory around G13.  This would be territory in the middle portion of the board and I have already mentioned how many moves it takes to secure this sort of territory.

So, I think black needs a better plan.  Focus on attacking your opponent's weak groups, or capturing the corners.  Capturing the sides is also OK to work on.  I have marked several possible moves for black.

J3 and R9 work to secure the bottom and right sides respectively. These are rather passive, defensive moves.  So, these would be best if you think you already have more territory than white.

D9 attacks the white stone at E9.  The reason this is better than the actual move you made is that D9 also starts securing the left side.

D17 and D16 invade the upper left corner.  They take advantage of white playing his opening move too far from the corner to really control it.

The 4 triangles near H16 invade the top side.];W[fj];B[fk]C[SC: This is a contact fight.  Contact means the stones are touching the opponent's stones.  A contact fight isn't always about killing your opponent.  You can often gain more by threatening to kill you oppoent's stones, then build up nice strong walls while your opponent scrambles to defend his stones.

In a contact fight, try to keep your stones in a few larger groups, rather than lots of little groups.

Counting liberties is very important in contact fights.  You want to increase your liberties and reduce your opponent's liberties. Before this move, black had a single stone group at G9 with 4 liberties.  Now black has a 2 stone group, but it still has 4 liberties.  If black played this move at F8 instead, then all 3 of black's stones would be more connected and black would have more liberties.]
;W[ej];B[og]SQ[sk][rk][qk][pk][oj][oi][oh][sg][rg][qg][pg][ok]
C[SC: This is still too high, too far from the side.  It may look like the marked stones control the area outlined, but they don't. There is too much room for white to invade and make a live group.

Black would be much more secure if these stones were at R9 and Q13 instead.  These locations would fit with the opening rules of thumb I mentioned earlier.]
;W[ph]C[SC: White invades, taking advantage of black's "high" stones. Now, white needs to either connect to the white stone in the top right corner, or make two eyes on the right side.  Since black can only work on preventing one of these two options per turn, white should be able to accomplish one of these

Black can choose which of those two options white does, however. So, black should decide which way he prefers white to go.]

(;B[qg]C[SC:  See the two variations that start on this move.]
;W[pg]
(;B[pf]SQ[qg]C[SC: This makes 3 seperate black groups of 1 stone each.

One important concept here is that contact fights are not usually about killing your opponent.  Contact fights are usually best for building up your strength while threatening and harassing your opponent.

Another important concept here is that I don't think White can be killed even if black tries.  There is enough room between black's 5th line stones and the side for white to live.   So, black should not be trying to kill white.  Once you get the idea of killing white out of your mind, you can focus on what you can do.

I think the marked stone is doomed, but it can still be useful. See the variation.]
;W[oi]
(;B[ni]C[SC: Playing right next to white is not the best way to surround white.  Playing one space away is often better.  See Variation.]
;W[nj];B[oh];W[nh];B[pi]C[SC: Good, this puts two different white groups in Atari.  White can only save one group, but white does get to pick which group to save.]
;W[oj]
(;B[mi]C[SC:  No, don't treaten to capture white, then let him off the hook.  You are trying to save one black stone, but letting 2 white stones escape in exchange.

I suspect this move was made with black focusing too much on saving every stone.  You will never save all of your stones, so don't get too focused on trying.  You want to make the best move on the whole board, not just the best move within 2 inches of white's last move.

See the Variations.];W[qh];B[qi];W[rh]C[SC: Currently, in this contact fight, black has 6 groups of stones with none larger than 2 stones.  White has 3 groups of stones with the largest of 4 stones.  The most liberties any group has is 3.

This many small groups is a recipe for disaster for black.  Black should start thinking about ways to connect stones and increase liberties.]

(;B[rg]C[SC: See variation.];W[ri]
(;B[qj]C[I know.. the empty triangle is a bad shape.. but how to save those two stones? Better to consider them lost?

SC: Consider them dead, but still see if you can use them.  See variation.

If you are about to make an empty triangle, stop and look all around for a better move. There will almost always be one. About the only time making an empty triangle is good is when you are making eyes to secure a surrounded group of stones.]
;W[rj];B[qk]C[SC: Black still has 6 groups and white still has only 3 groups.]
;W[of];B[ng];W[mh];B[oe];W[nf];B[mg];W[lh];B[mf];W[ne]C[SC: Black should see that the ladder won't work at this point and move on to something else.]
;B[nd];W[me];B[le];W[md]C[Here I realized that I the ladder was broken.

SC: You should be able to read out a ladder before you waste this many stones on something that won't work.]
;B[qe];W[od];B[pe]SQ[qd]C[SC: The square is better.  Playing the square makes more room for eyes.  Trying to save one stone and losing the whole group isn't a good trade.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lf]SQ[qd]C[SC: Pick one group and stay with it until it is secure and alive. Trying to save more than one weak group at a time usually means you don't save any. 

The square is still the best move locally.  The black group around N13 wil be very hard to save even is black focuses on just that group.  It has nothing that looks like an eye at this point. The black group against the right side has one eye around R14, so it only needs one more to live.

See Variation.];W[kg]C[SC: White is blocking black without playing in contact.   This usually works better than contact plays.]
;B[ld];W[kc]C[SC: White is still blocking black well];B[mc]
;W[nd];B[lc]C[SC: This long chain of black stones still has no eyes.  This means it is no better off than it was at move 53, so the last 3 black stones have done nothing useful]

;W[rl]C[this move was a surprise...

SC: White doesn't want black to be able to play on T8.  However, white can just capture at T10 and have two eyes.]

(;B[rm]C[it was better to play Q9?

SC: I would play at R8.  One way to choose your move is to find the point your opponent would most like to play, and play there first yourself.

See Variation.];W[ql]
(;B[pk]C[SC: This looks too much like making an empty triangle.  I think Q8 is better.  See variation.]
;W[lb];B[qb];W[nl];B[sm]C[SC: Play on S19 so your corner group will live.  No matter what you do around T8, white can always capture and T10 and live.]
;W[lg];B[nk];W[mj];B[ra]C[SC: Good.];W[kd];B[sl];W[kf]
(;B[sj]C[I think this was useless.

SC: I agree.  Playing at Q8 catches two white stones in a ladder that works for black.  See Variation.]
;W[og]C[SC: White doesn't need to connect here.];B[qa]C[SC: Black doesn't need to play in this corner until white has played on either R19 or R 17.

D17 is still good, although the large white wall at L16 means that a black invastion at D17 would get just the upper left corner, rather then the corner and part of the upper side.]

C[SC: Now the ladder doesn't work for black.];B[qm];W[pl];B[lk]

;W[li];B[jj]SQ[km]C[SC: Before this move, the one stone group at L10 had 4 liberties. Now it is a 2 stone group, but it still has 4 liberties.  So this move doesn't accomplish much.  L7 is still good. So is D17]
;W[kl]
(;B[kk]SQ[lj]C[SC: Playing on either square will connect black's stones.  So black doesn't need to play on either spot until right after white plays on one.

Thanks again.

SC: I don't think the game is lost yet.  The marked white stones need to make 2 eyes.  If black plays on J5 before white does, then the white stones have only one eye and will need to make a second eye to live.  Black doesn't have any weak stones, so there is nothing white can attack.

I continued the game as an example.];B[io]SQ[mn][fr][fq][dq]
C[SC: This is the key point.  If white plays here, then he has two eyes and only the marked white stones would be dead.  Black would be losing, but still might win with an invastion at D17.]
;W[lp]C[SC: White starts to make an eye at L4.];B[kq]C[SC: This is where white would like to play next, so black plays here first.]
;W[lq];B[ir]SQ[kq]C[SC: Black needs connect the marked stone to the group around H3.]
;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[js];W[lr]C[SC: White will need to play M1 before playing atari at L1.]
;B[nq]C[SC: Don't let white run into the corner and make an eye.]
;W[ls];B[ks];W[hs];B[is];W[gs];B[nr]C[SC: It may be hard to see, but white is dead.   This means that black controls the lower half of the board.  White has most of the upper half, but the large number of dead white stones puts black ahead.  Black could still invade at D17, but you don't need to do risky things like that when you are winning.

Now the end game would start. Probably white's best endgame move would be D17 just to make sure black can't invade.  Black could then play C9 and go from there.

Don't play contact when trying to surround something.  Play about 1 space away.

If you do end up in a contact fight, don't make lots of little groups of stones.

If you have more than one weak group, focus on saving only one at a time.  Usually start with the easiest group to save first.

Don't try to save every stone.

Look for the best move on the whole board, not the best move locally.

Empty triangles are bad unless you are making eyes.])
