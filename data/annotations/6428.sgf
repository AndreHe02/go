C[Hello, daveadams here. I played white in this game. I should have lost this game, but I managed to save a group of mine and kill a group of black's which swung the score my way in the end.

I made a lot of obvious mistakes in this game, but I think I also made some bigger mistakes that I probably don't see.

Mostly I'm interested in how I might improve my fuseki, and there are a couple of fights where I just really didn't know how to handle how black played. Endgame advice is appreciated, although I think I came out relatively well in that regard for this game.

I'll comment on particular points at which I have questions as well.

catch22: Hi, I'll be your reviewer for this game. Thanks for giving me an interesting game to comment on.

One disclaimer before we start, when I say "it is better", or something similar, I typically mean "I think it is better". I am far away from  mastering the game of Go myself, so I am not always right of course, but still I hope that you'll find my comments useful. :-)]
;B[pc];W[dd];B[qp];W[cq]C[daveadams: I'm not very comfortable with the 3-3 opening, so I'm just experimenting here.

catch22: I believe it's a bit uncommon to play a 3-3 stone together with a 4-4 stone. They generally don't work that well together, as the 3-3 fits a territorial strategy, whereas a 4-4 stone goes for influence instead. However, it's good to experiment.]
;B[nq];W[qj]C[daveadams: Is this the right place to play? Maybe R11 instead? Or somewhere else?

catch22: I think R11 is better, and I also prefer R9 above R10. The problem with R10 is that it gives Black a continuation where his stones are ideally placed (see variation for the next move).]

(;B[qf]C[catch22: I think it is better to approach from the other side. See variation.]
;W[qm];B[co]
(;W[dp]C[daveadams: Again, I'm unsure of where best to play here. I also considered E4.

catch22: E4 is better. This gives a more balanced position when White next extends further along the bottom (see variation)]
;B[dm];W[hq]C[daveadams: Too far?

catch22: No, White can handle an invasion at F3 (see variation for the next move) playing at G3 instead would be too inefficient. The White group would be too cramped.]

(;B[jq]C[daveadams: Were I black I would have played L3 here.

catch22: Out of K3 and L3, K3 is better as it not only extends Black's position, but also puts pressure on the white group. Playing L3 only extends Black's position, so seems too slow. Although it creates a more solid position, overall the move is less efficient.

Having said all that, Black should settle his group at the left by playing C10 or C11. That is much more important than a move at the bottom.]
;W[ho]C[daveadams: This doesn't look right to me. F4 seems like better shape, but K3 is so close...

catch22: K3 is much better than F4. F4 only surrounds territory, and it's only a little, given that four stones have been used. K3 on the other hand also stops Black from invading, it also threatens an invasion at M3, and gives White more influence in the center.

Furthermore, it is important to realise that in the opening you should not aim to build invulnerable positions. That is simply not efficient. Just make sure that when your opponent invades a position of yours, you get something (territory elsewhere, or influence) in return that is just as valuable.]
;B[jo]
(;W[jc]C[daveadams: Here I considered C9, C10, or C11 as another option, but decided to play towards the shimari instead.

catch22: I think it would have been better to play at C9 instead. Obviously, K17 is a big move. It is a good point for both players. However, C9 gives White a good attack on the black stones that will also help White's position. See variation.]
;B[fc]C[catch22: This looks a bit premature. Black should just settle his group at the left by playing at C11. This also reduces the size of White's moyo at the top.]

(;W[ec]C[daveadams: Okay, this is the first fight where I didn't know how best to respond, and I think I came out for the worse.

catch22: E17 helps to strengthen Black, as it induces F16. Therefore, it is better to play D17 instead. See variation.]
;B[ic]C[daveadams: This looks like a bad play to me, but I didn't manage to punish it.

catch22: This is indeed not good. It helps White to strengthen his stone at K17. Black should just play F16.]

(;W[id]C[catch22: Best to just extend (see variaton). The cut at K16 helps Black to settle his stones.]
;B[ib]C[catch22: This is awkward shape. It is better for Black to extend to H17. He can then either jump out (G15), or cut at K16.]
;W[fd];B[fb];W[eb];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[hd];W[ie];B[he]
C[daveadams: Already I'm split up, black is free, and my wall points nowhere useful.

catch22: Well, I actually think you got a good result here. Firstly, you've gotten points in the corner, with the option to extend alongside the left side of the board. Secondly, your wall effectively stops Black from getting any territory in front of his shimary. Thirdly, Black's stones have poor shape and are not out of danger yet, and they only make a few points of territory.]
;W[hf]TR[he][hd]C[catch22: This is good. It punishes Black's bad shape. It takes a liberty away from the two marked stones, and if Black wants to move into the center, he has to make an empty triangle.]
;B[gf];W[ge]C[catch22: Good. Although White has to be careful that his stones at the right are not cut apart, Black is too weak to do so right now.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[hg];W[if];B[ff]C[catch22: So Black is cut off from the center after all...]

(;W[df]C[catch22: This move lets Black of the hook a bit. Better play at G17. See variation.]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[ee];W[ed];B[de];W[ce];B[ig];W[kf];B[cf]C[daveadams: This is the other fight where I wasn't happy with the result. My corner is weak so I chose to defend it, making yet another weak and heavy group with C13.

catch22: Once again, you are too negative about your position. It's been Black who has been making overplays, which have left him with many weaknesses. This you can punish if you patiently wait for a good opportunity to do so. I'll try to show this later on.]
;W[cd]C[daveadams: Probably B15 is better.

catch22: I don't agree, because it leave a weakness behind at C16, which would give Black more chances to settle his stone at C14. Playing at C16 forces Black to play at C13, which means Black is pushing from behind, which is in White's advantage.]
;B[cg];W[dh];B[ch]
(;W[fh]C[catch22: This is a bad move. It forces Black to connect. White should keep the option of cutting at G13 open. See variation.]
;B[gh];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj]C[daveadams: This double hane was a terrible idea. :)

catch22: Indeed. Reading mistakes like this are very costly. This move severely weakens your stones while strengtening Black's. :-(]
;B[di];W[ei];B[cj];W[ej];B[gi];W[jg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ji];W[gk]
;B[gj]C[catch22: Not good. Black unnecessarily strengthens White. It would be better for Black to play L11 and keep the option of cutting (at F9 open).]
;W[fk];B[hk];W[hl];B[ik]C[daveadams: Black's crawling here drove me nuts. I kept feeling like I shouldn't respond, but also that I had to. My R7 group is beginning to look weak, too.

catch22: The way I see it, Black has only helped you. Your stones in the center where very weak, and they are pretty safe now. Black may have also strengthened his own center group, but it was not in much danger anyway, because the white group was even weaker. So these last moves helped you to catch up. Of course, you are still behind, but that's because of the two bad moves earlier on (F12 and B10).]
;W[gm]C[catch22: Although this is good shape, you could consider omitting it to take sente (you have to try something to catch up). It gives Black the opportunity to cuat at G8, but you can still connect by squeezing this cutting stone.]
;B[il];W[im];B[jm];W[qq]C[daveadams: I was feeling desperate at this point, so I made this probe move that I don't really understand. It turned out okay, but I think Black could have done more. Had he sealed me in and built a wall facing up my R7 group would be in bad shape.

catch22: Well, indeed, you have to try something to catch up. If you let Black make too much territory here, it is not clear how you can catch up. It is, however, an emergency measure, and not something you'd normally play. If Black handles it properly, you should not gain anything.]

(;B[rp]C[catch22: Black gives you a chance immediately. Black should have played at Q4, see variation.]
;W[pq];B[rq];W[pp]C[catch22: This is already a great result for White. Black now has three weak stones to worry about and White may cause an upset in the fight that follows.]
;B[pn]C[catch22: Bad shape. Black should just play Q5. This also puts more pressure on the White stones, as the O3 stone is placed perfectly.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[qr]
(;W[po]C[catch22: Not good. It lets Black connect his stones after all. Play Q2 instead. See variation.]
;B[on]C[catch22: Even though White can catch this stone in a loose ladder, this stone is not worth saving. R12 would for instance be better. It expands Black position at the top, indirectly helps to defend against invasions there, and it keeps some pressure on the white stones (nevertheless, they're pretty safe for the time being)]
;W[pr];B[rr];W[kn];B[jn];W[no];B[nn]C[daveadams: I think Black made some mistakes over the next few moves.

catch22: Black also made various mistakes in the moves leading up to this. Already you are back in the game.]

(;W[mo]C[catch22: It is better to play P4 (see variation). As it is, you still have to worry about the cut that is left behind.]
;B[ko]C[catch22: Not a good move. It is not even clear to me what it is trying to achieve.]
;W[ln]TR[kn]C[catch22: Saving the marked stone is not important. It is not serving any purpose. So it is better to play N6. This puts more pressure on the black stones. It takes a liberty away, and also does not give Black the free forcing move at N6 (Black should not play this forcing exchange immediately, but it could come in handy later on).]
;B[ok]
(;W[oi]C[catch22: This is not a good move. Although it attacks the black stones, it does not really help White. For instance, it does not make any territory. You should not just attack for the sake of it, but always make sure that you gain by doing so. 

See variation for a more constructive attack.];B[qh]C[catch22: Now Black gets to play here instead of White (compare with the variation for the previous move).]
;W[qi];B[ph];W[oh]C[catch22: Once again White leaves a potential cutting point behind. You should only do so when there's a clear benefit. I don't think that is the case here, so better to just play P10.]
;B[mk];W[kk];B[kl];W[ll];B[lk];W[kj];B[lm];W[ml];B[mm];W[nl]
;B[ol];W[km];B[jl];W[oo];B[eo];W[ep];B[fo];W[gp];B[go];W[hn]
;B[fp];W[fq];B[do];W[nm]
(;B[om]C[catch22: Better for Black to play at N6, and at least get some compensation (see variaton).]
;W[mn];B[ki];W[lj];B[lh];W[kg];B[mj];W[mi];B[li];W[nk];B[mh]
;W[nj]C[daveadams: At this point (probably well before) it's clear my J15 group needs eyes, but I tried to connect instead.

catch22: You indeed have to make sure that it does not die because that should guarantee a win. Ensuring the group lives is not difficult as long as you realise that M18 (or moves nearby) are sente. If Black does not respond, White G17 kills the group at the top.

By the way, it's amazing how the game has turned around after your invasion at R3.Your two weak stones have transformed into a monsterous group, that destroyed most of Black's territory and made a lot of points itself.]
;B[og]C[catch22: Not good. Black should attack the white group to stand any chance at all, e.g. by playing at N14.]
;W[ng]C[catch22: Not good either. Just play at N14. It is much better shape. It for instance helps to protect against Black M15. This is quite a vital point. Black L15 next would take away all eye shape in the center.]
;B[of];W[nf];B[nd];W[nh];B[md];W[nb]C[daveadams: Should have just connected. Instead I was being greedy/overconfident that even if I got cut off I could manage two eyes here.

catch22: Indeed. All you need to do is connect, and you have a sure win.]
;B[lf]C[This play drove home how bad my shape was.];W[le];B[me]
C[catch22: This is very poor shape. Black should have just played N14.]
;W[mf]C[daveadams: Okay I see now that M13 would have connected. Duh.

catch22: :-)];B[lg];W[ke];B[ld]
(;W[lb]C[catch22: First play L16. See variation.];B[kd];W[nc]
C[daveadams: I'm not sure how I missed that I was getting cut. I thought I had one more move to make an eye. Too bad for white!

catch22: Yes, you're giving Black the chance to get back into the game.]
;B[je]C[daveadams: Turns out the way black chose to cut was bad. this is part of why I managed to win. Black K16 is better. I suppose he was trying to save a move to keep me from connecting around P16?

catch22: Black was maybe just being too clever. He should indeed simply have cut at K16. As it is, his stones at the top are still not out of danger yet.]
;W[jd];B[jf];W[od]C[catch22: Best to simply play at G17. You will still win the capturing race by one move.]
;B[oe];W[oc];B[pd];W[pb];B[qb]
(;W[pa]C[daveadams: Probably should have played tenuki in here instead of forcing it. I was hoping I could make eyes, but I hadn't read it out. It was hopeless

catch22: Tenuki? What? Are you crazy? ;-) Just play P19 and you've got your two eyes. See variation.]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[na];W[qc];B[qd];W[rc];B[rb]
(;W[bp]C[daveadams: Giving up on my M17 group I go for some yose moves hoping to catch up some.

catch22: What? Still too premature. You can still live easily. See variation.]

;W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[em];B[en];W[fm]C[catch22: These last two moves were bad. They only take a few points. Not enough to lose sente.]
;B[be];W[bd];B[bf];W[fa]C[daveadams: So here's where I manage to save myself. Black played very poorly, though. I should have been easy to kill.

catch22: Well, I think it is fair to say that both players entirely misread the situation at the top. :-)

Had the white group at the top right been alive, there would be no way for Black to save his stones.]

catch22: I this game your fuseki was not bad. Maybe you are a bit too careful (e.g. by playing extensions that are just a bit too safe), but I think your main problem was that you did not fully appreciate your position for what it was worth. When the other player has been playing thinly and left weaknesses in his position (as happened in the game), that works in your favour. You simply have to find a way to exploit those weaknesses. Sometimes this requires patients. Furthermore, Black staked out more territory initially, but it was still open to invasion, and that has to be taken into account when evaluating the position.

From this game, I'd say that inaccurate reading was more of a problem. A clear example was the life-and-death situation at the top, but also the double hane at B10 at the start of the game. These were both of crucial importance. Fortunately, it's easy to improve your reading skills. It mostly requires dedication. Simply practise a lot of life-and-death and tesuji problems.]
