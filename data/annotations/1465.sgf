AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer,

I'd like to have you show me better moves in general.
And especially the timing of moves.  What's urgent and what's not.  What could
have been a better sequence of moves.
I didn't take care of my left bottom corner in time, it died.  My middle bottom
almost died.  What should I had done and when? Was the shape i left it in for
quite a while dangerous?
Any pointers about the middle game/middle board;  I always seem to be lost about
that part of the game.

Thank you very much for reviewing

Regards,
Yimeng];W[nq];B[lq]C[dada: playing the low pincer in handicap games is not really good. It cannot be expected that white jumps into the corner at this early stage .....]
;W[no]C[dada: .... so white jumps out here. ....]
(;B[ip]LB[pn:A]C[dada: ... and black should play at 'a' to avoid his corner stone being shut in.
(see variation).];W[pn]TR[ip][dp]C[dada: this is good for white. Note that black has to make life for his stone in the corner, while W builds influence. Also, the distance between the two marked stones is big, so once white has built influence, he can invade easily.]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qq];W[jp]C[dada: ashi keshi];B[mp]C[dada: not necessary - only makes white stronger in this area.]
;W[np];B[jq];W[qf]C[dada: white is putting the thickness in the lower right corner to use.]

(;B[qi]LB[pi:A]C[dada: a low pincer in this situation is not good. Do you really want to make a pitiful 2 point-life on the side, while white builds further influence? If you play a pincer here, then it has to be on the 4th line around 'a'. One could also argue not to play a pincer at all and instead develop the upper side. (see variation.)]
;W[pj]LB[of:A][nd:B]C[dada: this looks like a bad move (I'd play something like 'a' or 'b')]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[qg];W[pf];B[pk];W[ok];B[pl];W[ol]
;B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[oi];B[of];W[nh];B[oe]C[dada: up to here it seems like black achieved something -- but white's influence (plus the ponnuki) should not be underestimated.
Black is doing well.];W[rd]
(;B[rl]C[dada: bad - see variation instead.];W[qc];B[pc];W[jc]
;B[lc]C[dada: as a consequence of missing the opportunity to kill the w group in the corner black has to play this pitiful move. White has not played a flawless game, but somehow he is still in command.]
;W[fc]
(;B[ec]LB[hc:A][df:B]C[dada: ouch! Why play something like this? You force white into perfect shape.
If you want to play hardball, then invade at 'a' right away. Otherwise play peacefully and extend at 'b' (see variation).]
;W[fd]C[dada: white is happy];B[df];W[cn]TR[ec]C[dada: because of the marked black stone white gets sente to play here (compare with previous variation)]
;B[kd]C[dada: black is losing a move here ....];W[fp]C[dada: ... which gives white the opportunity to cause some trouble.]
;B[gq]C[dada: playing diagonally below a stone is bad in 95% of all cases.]

(;W[fq]C[dada: let's see why the diagonal move was bad (see variation)]

(;B[co]C[dada: what's the idea behind this move? Never try to live when you can run. See variation instead.
This move only strengthens white.];W[dn];B[eq]LB[eo:A]C[dada: this is your last chance to play at 'a' and try to split white into two.]
;W[fr];B[cq];W[hr]LB[eo:A]C[dada: white should be satisfied and connect his groups at 'a' instead, then play an extension along the left side next.]
;B[jo];W[kp];B[ko];W[eo];B[jd];W[ic];B[ci]C[dada: good - white is punished for missing the crucial point on the left side.]
;W[cc];B[eb]C[dada: good fighting spirit];W[ce];B[cd]LB[de:A]
C[dada: this is inconsequent - connect at 'a' instead and let white live. Then chase the white group on the top.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[cf]
(;B[ed]LB[dg:A]C[dada: there's nothing to be afraid of - black has to play at 'a' instead (see variation)]
;W[dg];B[cl]C[dada: ouch!!! bad move.
never give your opponent a ponnuki!!!];W[ef]C[dada: white is extremely happy!]
;B[bc];W[fe]C[dada: white secures his weak top group -- a great benefit for white
and the black group on the left side still may come under attack.]
;B[rf];W[pb];B[rb]LB[ob:A]C[dada: as this does not kill the W group, black should just play at 'a' instead]
;W[qb];B[ob];W[ra]C[dada: white lives];B[fl]LB[el:A]C[dada: too loose - one point closer (at 'a') is better]
;W[dl]C[dada: white hits the weak spot];B[dk];W[el];B[ek];W[fk]
;B[gl];W[bn]C[dada: dangerous move -- threatens to kill the corner. White's group is weak also, so it's a gamble, but black has to save his corner group now.]
;B[fj]LB[bp:A][dr:B][br:C]C[dada: black sacrifices the corner - a play at 'a', 'b', or 'c' would have saved the corner.]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[dr];B[kk]C[dada: let's do a rough count:
white: lower left: 25 points+, upper right: 5 points, top: another 5 points, right side: 5 points+: 40 points or more
black: upper left: 10 points+, 10 points- on the left, 10 points- at the bottom, 10 points lower right, 10 points+ at the right, 10 points at the top: about 60 points

So black is ahead 20 points -- this is from a 4 stone handicap, so black has lost about 20 points already. White is on the right track. The fight in the center where both players have potential for more territory will decide the game.]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[pr];B[qr];W[pq];B[rq];W[jk]C[dada: this looks like an overplay]
;B[hi];W[kj];B[ff]C[dada: good - the deciding battle starts]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[he];B[hf]LB[gg:A]C[dada: better play at 'a']
;W[ie]C[dada: white is strengthend];B[eh];W[dh];B[di];W[fh]
;B[fi];W[bh];B[if];W[je];B[gb];W[fb];B[fa];W[hb]LB[jf:A]TR[fe]
[fd][fc][fb]C[dada: white is too weak to play around here -- he has to sacrifice the marked stones and then play at 'a' next and try to attack the black group on the right.]
;B[gc];W[hd]C[dada: suicidal];B[kg]C[dada: good];W[kf];B[lg]
LB[lf:A]C[dada: correct - the other shape move here (at 'a') does not work]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[lf];B[mg];W[jf];B[jh];W[mf];B[ng];W[nf];B[ki]
LB[qe:A][oh:B]C[dada: black played tough - actually the top group has nothing to worry about: there's the capture at 'a' and if that fails the ko at 'b']
;W[mb];B[mc]LB[lb:A]C[dada: why not at 'a'? Playing at 'a' should kill white right away.]
;W[lb];B[re];W[nb];B[oa];W[nc];B[oc];W[qd];B[qe];W[sb];B[nd]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[ha];B[ga];W[kl]LB[ja:A]C[dada: black's attack was a success - if white uses this move to make life for the top group (e.g. by playing at 'a'), then black plays here instead (l8) and makes a big chunk of territory in the center and wins the game hands down.

Black showed good fighting spirit throughout the game, although sometimes it is better to concede with white's wishes and make some safe territory (or moyos) instead. White for his part made too many lukewarm moves and fought an uphill battle.

It seems that black didn't make full use of his handicap stones. These stones are on the 4th line, so you should play for influence and not get into messy (and small) hand-to-hand combat. Try the following in your next 4 stone handicap game: play your first 3 moves on star-points on the side, then play "normal" from there and try to exploit the influence you have created.

Black also has the tendency to play unnecessary moves which strengthen white like moves 10, 40, and 48. Your priority should be to keep white weak and separated. And don't let white make ponnukis that easily. The ponnuki in the upper left corner was quite dangerous for black - if white had put it to full use he could have won the game easily by attacking the lonely two black stones on the left side (not to kill them, but to force them into small life on the side while white makes territory in the center). But white missed his chance and thus black won the game.]

After that white can still manage some life on the side, but his top group will come under heavy attack.
Note that if white cuts at 'a' black plays 'b' and has secure life.]

;W[lo];B[jq];W[ip];B[hq]TR[nq]LB[qq:A]C[dada: a standard joseki, but not optimal for black in handicap games. White builds influence torwards the center, while black crawls along the side. That's not making good use of the handicap stones, which are geared torwards influence. This is why the low pincer is not an optimal move.

The white stone can be cut off, but W still has the 3-3 invasion at 'a', so there's little territory for black here.]
