C[Nisse [8k\]: hi!
fatso [7k\]: hello

Nisse: This is a game I would like to have reviewed for two main reasons. First I'd like to know how I should have played to win this game, because I think I was in the lead but lost it. Second I'd like to know what I most urgently need to improve in my game to develop as a player.

I've had one game reviewed before (when I was about 20k) and it helped a lot.

Thank you for your time and effort!];B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pd]
;B[co];W[di];B[df]LB[cf:A]C[EmTom: I would prefer to play this move at A. It makes your corner more solid and attacks white as well.]
;W[cl];B[jq]LB[nc:A]C[EmTom: A good move. The other possibility was to approach white corner at A.]
;W[cg];B[jd]LB[lc:A][nc:B]C[EmTom: Hmm... I don't really like this move. If white plays at A it is hard for black to answer. It seems that k16 wants to build towards the center but theres not that much potential there. I think it would be better to approach white corner at B right away]
;W[md];B[qj];W[qm];B[qg]C[Nisse: So far I think I've done well. Now he invades me and throughout the game I handle invasions badly.

EmTom: I'm not sure about this position. It's quite unusual. I think it is about even...]
;W[hc];B[fc]LB[be:A]TR[df]C[EmTom: You have terrible shape in the corner now. White can still reduce it greatly with a slide to A. Your marked stone seems totally out of place now.]
;W[jc]
(;B[hd]C[EmTom: It looks quite bad for black... white gets nice territory and blacks influence is limited by d11 stone. Maybe you should have cut white and try to attack it? It looks difficult tough.]

(;B[mi]LB[rd:C][bf:B][qq:A]TR[qg][qj]C[EmTom: This move doesnt do that much. I think you should have invaded white corner at A or defended your territory at B. You also could have reduced top right which makes your marked stones stronger.]

;W[qb];B[rc];W[rb]C[Nisse: How should I have played this corner?

EmTom: You shouldnt have played here at all. Up to r18 its a joseki. White takes corner back, black gets ponuki on the side. If you can live on top its ok for you but if you cant its a disaster. I think its impossible to live in this situation. See another joseki in variation on move 65.]

EmTom: Yes. I believe white is behind after this blunder. You can't get overconfident though.]
;W[nn];B[lm];W[gp]C[Nisse: How should I have handled this invasion?

EmTom: Well you shouldn't touch this stone for sure. You play tsuke when you want to defend not attack. I would try to force it to connect to left side group. This way black can get some cash in the center.]

 (EmTom: sente? you ment seki didnt you ;))
fatso [7k\]: it's dead
Nisse [8k\]: yes
Nisse [9k\]: thx

Nisse: Thanks again to whoever reviews me!

EmTom: Ok so generally: dont play so many stones high (4th line) early in the game if theres no moyo potential. Don't be affraid to approach opponent corners in the opening.  Also to attack doesnt always mean to kill. Try to figure out how to gain from the attack. Go all out for a kill only if you are sure that you can do it or you have to kill to win the game.

EmTom: If you have any further questions feel free to ask (my KGS nick is EmTom)]
