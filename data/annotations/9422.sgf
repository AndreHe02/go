C[Elom: Hello, I'm Elom, and my inquires start with Elom:

I would firstly like to thank you again for reviewing my game-- your help is greatly appreciated. This game became confusing for me in the opening, to the point where I could judge the position. Positional judgment is my weak point, and I would love to have some assistance with that. I would also like to know of big endgame moves that i have missed, wich is also a problem for me.

F: The focus in this game is the attack on the white group on the left side. You start of very well, but later miss the opportunities to finish the job, by trying to rescue the weak white stones in the middle.
Other questionable moves are white 18, 42 and 54.
To improve your positional judgment, you should try to assess regulary the situation on the board. Which groups are strong, which weak. How is the balance in terms of territory. How can I attack a weak group of my opponent, so as to improve your own position.]
;B[pd]C[Elom [7k\]: Hello,
dreadcat [7k\]: hi
Elom [7k\]: have a nice game.];W[qp]C[dreadcat [7k\]: gg];B[dq]
;W[dd];B[op];W[do];B[eo];W[en];B[dp]C[Elom: I wasn't sure how to handle this move at all.]
;W[fo];B[ep]
(;W[co]C[F: Now you have two cutting points];B[fn];W[fm];B[gn]
;W[dm];B[jp]C[Elom: Black ends up extremely powerful, so I tried to make him over concentrated.]
;W[oq]C[F: This is not making black overconcentrated? you just help him to expand his big bottomside]
;B[nq];W[pq];B[np]C[Elom: Black seems to follow me, maybe this was good for black.
F: Very good for black, He gains more than your 15 points in the corner]
;W[nr]C[Elom: I played here because...];B[mr];W[qn]C[Elom: ...black has to choose weather to take gote with p2, which he won't, so I could play p2.
F: You could play here, without exchanging O2 against N2. This is aji keshi (wasting of possibilities). Maybe later you want to play at N2 yourself]
;B[ci]C[Elom: This is where I begin to get confused in the opening. I feel like the opening is too good for black, but I can't know for sure, and after black plays here I feel like the game is bad for white.
F: You helped black on the bottom side, but this doesn't mean that the game is bad for you.
This is the time for some positional judgment. .
You have a strong group around D6, You should use this group to chase the black stone at C11, toward this strong group and develop your UL side.
Let's see]
(;W[or]C[Elom: Was this too early?
F: Off course, this is way too small and shows a lack of positional judgment. See var]
;B[lq]C[F: You are lucky that black misses his oppurtunity]
;W[cg]C[F: Yes, this is the  right move!!];B[ei];W[dj];B[di]
C[F: This is making black heavy, ok.
The question now is how to continue the attack]
(;W[eg]C[F; For another option, see var.];B[el]
(;W[dl]C[F: Just connecting is easier, I think.];B[ej];W[fl]
;B[fk];W[dk];B[ek];W[em];B[jd]C[Elom: The position becomes quite akward for white. I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I don't know how it got this bad.
F: Not so bad at all, you just created a nice clump of black stones to attack. Even if you don't kill them, your position will be so that it's much easier to invade the upper side and reduce the bottom.]
;W[bk]C[Elom: Is this move too slow?
F: But you misjudge the situation. this white group is not in danger, you're making 10 points at the best, you shoult play in thet centre anayway]
;B[cc]C[F: Overplay. Black sthould take care of his center group.]
;W[dc]C[Elom: should I have blocked from the other side?
F: No,  this is ok. Blocking on the other side would be too small for you.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[ld]C[F: You should first make yourself strong and connect. Than you can attack with all force]
;B[fc]
(;W[hd]C[F: This is making things easy for black; He can connect at E17.See vvar]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[gd];W[id];B[ec]C[Elom [7k\]: sorry, I had to go for a second.
F: Big loss for white];W[gg]C[dreadcat [7k\]: i will hurry up
F: Very good];B[gf];W[hn]C[Elom: I'm pretty much in utter confusion up to this point, ?)
I was just hoping to make myself stronger here before attacking e10.
F: Your left group is strong enough, you could attack right now]
;B[ho]C[F; F5 is stronger, leaves no weak point]
(;W[in]C[F: See var];B[io]C[Elom: seemed quite risky for black.]
;W[go]C[F: Since the ladder isn't working, this is a risky move]
;B[gm]
(;W[gl]C[Elom: This might be an unnecassary move.];B[hm];W[im]
;B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[jl];B[ik];W[ij];B[jk]
(;W[km]CR[hk][ij]MA[jl][im][in][hn]C[F; After palying the o-stones, you can't expect to save the x-stones too. See var]
;B[kl]C[Elom: I'm in trouble.
F: Connecting a H10 is sitll the best.
Now you're fighting in blacks sphere of influence];W[kk];B[jm]
;W[jn];B[jl];W[jj];B[ll];W[pj]C[F;  Now you leave a weak point at H10 behind]

;B[fj]C[F: Disaster for white, the game is  as good as over]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[ad];B[jc]C[Elom: the game has collapsed on me, but if I hadn't made black so strong in the opening, it could have been possible to comeback.]
