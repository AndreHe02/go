C[jds [9k\]: hello
arcin [10k\]: hi

AB: In this game I am playing Black. My impression during the
opening and early middle game was that I had many opportunities
to attach White's weak groups. I could not do it. I am looking
for comments on "direction of play and why?",  critical moves
missed in the game (why is it critical).

I felt against a style of play like that I should have won easily.
I won but not because I played well.

All other comments welcome. Variations in the game file are definitely
appreciated.

Thanks to the reviewer.


K: Hi, I'll mark my comments as reviewer by "K:"

K: As you said, your opponent causes a lot of trouble for himself. You just need to take advantage of the weak groups. You did that well enough to win the game!

K: The biggest issue is life&death. By reading out correctly the life&death of White C14 group, Black D17 group and White R3 group you would not have given your opponent so many chances.

K: Other than that I think move 59 is too soft and 93 is an overplay: a calm move would have given a harder time for White.]

(;W[cf]
(;B[ci]LB[ch:A]C[AB: this was perfect for me. an extension and a pincer. could
it be harsher? Maybe at A? is 3rd line correct?

K: Third line is correct in my opinion. As you suggest, A is more severe. In fact I think White enters an unnecessarily narrow side and omits a natural move in the lower left.]
;W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[K: You can build a wall.];W[fc]LB[fd:B][ee:A]C[AB: I didn't see it as an attach. More as a chance to cut into
two weak groups.

K: This seems like an overplay. You can simply keep White split into two weak groups by A. To attack the weaker group (C14), it is common to attach (lean) to the stronger at B.]

(;B[df];W[cg];B[dg]C[AB: he is settling himself. Is there a sequence that could kill
him? I did not see one so I just blocked him in and was hoping
to use thickness afterwards.

K: Sealing White is good.];W[bc]
(;B[bb]C[K: To block at C12 may be more efficient. There is no territory in the corner anyway.]
;W[cd];B[dc]
(;W[bh]C[K: B11 is probably better for White.];B[bi];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[de];B[ee];W[ce];B[fd];W[gc];B[af]C[AB: didn't clearly read this one so wasn't expecting much out
of it... But I felt like I could do something... Didn't work.

K: The group is alive and not all moves are sente so you're risking a free move for White (it is almost like giving a handicap stone!).]
;W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[bk];W[bf];B[ae]C[K: Not sente. If you know life&death you will not give a free move for your opponent.]

(;W[ag]C[K: Mistake.];B[ab]C[K: Definitely not sente!]
(;W[ac]C[K: Big mistake!];B[jc]C[K: Yes, to attack the weak group is important. Again, J17 may be more severe.]
;W[gd]
(;B[nc]C[AB: White allows me to play these nice moves. But I cannot really
turn them into territory. Or attack him well afterwards.

K: Now is the time to attack. Territory will come for free during the attack.]
;W[lc]C[K: Again, this is an overplay.];B[je]C[AB: Cut into two.

K: Good!];W[ge]
(;B[ne]C[AB : Safe Territory and hoping to solidly capture single W stone.

K: Attack G16. The White stone at M17 should face a natural death while White struggles with the other group.]
;W[le]C[K: White can't be serious!];B[jg]C[K: Yes, White is hurting himself bad.]
;W[if];B[jf];W[gg]
(;B[pj]C[AB: Instead of trying to capture the two W stones, I went for
more territory.

K: This is a big point, but as both White groups are weak you can block their way to the center. The game is very much favourable for Black.]
;W[qm];B[jp]C[K: On the third line it is easier to make a base.]
;W[rj];B[fq]
(;W[fp]
(;B[gq]LB[gp:B][eq:A]C[K: This is too soft. You can play more severely at A. In many situations B is the simple and good option.]
;W[eq];B[gp];W[fo];B[nq];W[lq]C[AB: AGain! He is going in, leaving himself weak. But then, I
can't make use of it.

K: This White is more than fearless :).];B[no];W[mp];B[np];W[ln]
;B[hm]LB[nm:A]C[AB: I should have played this one probably at "A". But I was
hoping to eventually build presence below the big W group to
force into making defensive moves to create eye shape for himself.

K: A would be a good move, it also aims at weaknesses of the White lower right group.]
;W[fm];B[mm];W[lm];B[ml];W[jm]
(;B[ko]C[K: This is not the vital point.];W[lo];B[gn];W[fn]
;B[gi]C[K: Good leaning. Now White has too many weak groups.]
;W[fh]C[AB: I should have read the situation here...

K: There is no problem.];B[fi];W[ec];B[ed];W[ef]
(;B[kq]C[AB: I figured top B was dead but I had two weak White groups to attach. So I started the attach below.

K: You need to read life&death situations more carefully.];W[kk]
;B[lj];W[lk];B[mk];W[ik];B[il];W[jl]
(;B[jj]C[K: This is overly aggressive, you can take the eye away by playing J10,K10,L10 at any stage.]
;W[kj]
(;B[jk];W[ji];B[ij];W[li];B[mj]
(;W[mi]C[K: White can connect to G15 group at any stage now.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[lf];W[mf];B[me];W[oh]C[AB: Finally, only one group is dead. Out of 4 weak groups.

K: This is the natural death that the group was supposed to face.]
;B[mh];W[lh];B[nh];W[ni];B[ng];W[og];B[nf];W[oj];B[pl];W[pi]
;B[qj];W[qi];B[rk];W[ri];B[qo]C[K: Good, another group has become too weak!]
;W[po];B[qn];W[pn];B[pm];W[qp];B[rm];W[rp];B[pr];W[qr];B[pq]
;W[ro];B[rn];W[qq];B[sr];W[rr];B[sq];W[qs]C[AB: White lives.... as far as i can see..

K: More life&death problems :). This is a bent four in the corner. White is dead (but it will be evident only in the end of the game when there is no more ko threats).]

(;B[kh];W[ki];B[ll];W[kl];B[hg];W[ff];B[kn];W[km];B[qg]C[AB: All previous moves were preparations for this, to take his eye space away...

K: White can connect to the G16 group.]
(;W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[qe];W[qh];B[pf];W[pg];B[sg]C[AB: I figured he had his eyes and though Ko would be that only way...]
;W[qf];B[eb]C[K: This move makes your group alive, remember? This is a big move, but not a ko threat. Moreover, the ko is not important because White has J11. However, G16 group is in trouble :).]
;W[fb]
(;B[qg];W[ii];B[hj];W[qf];B[db];W[hf]C[AB here he let me live at the top corner. I do not know why.... At that point I also make the living move and ignore the potential kill of the big White group... This was much safer and  a lot of points :)

K: Now you know why...];B[ca]C[AB: Now I am clearly leading in territory.

K: And now you know that this is a wasted move. :) You could instead kill lower right by T5. Life&death makes a big difference!]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[nm];B[on];W[ok];B[nl];W[di];B[dj];W[ei];B[ej]

(;B[ck]C[K: This is not necessary!];W[io];B[ip];W[im];B[hl]
;W[fk];B[el];W[fl];B[lr];W[fj];B[ho]C[AB: He tried to capture some stones but I didn't give him the chance and he resigned....

The game should have developed so much differently. Clearly something is missing from my play. I cannot take advantage of weaknesses properly. Could please give me ideas on this...

Thank you for the review

K: Most importantly I think studying life&death will make any player stronger. The biggest mistakes in this game are life&death related.]
