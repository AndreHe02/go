C[I am black (mortymanta). At the end of this review could you what my strangth is cause i have to teach myself since I live in Jamaica. I play on the KGS server and on that server im 25kyu. I am not sure if thats my true rank.

`` My name is Kim and I'll be reviewing for black.  I'll start all of my comments with `` to make them easy to identify.

To answer your rank question now:  As long as you have a solid rank on KGS (meaning a rank without a question mark next to it), you can be pretty certain that it is your actual rank.  There are many different ranking systems in the world, and each is a little different.  But, many people are familiar with the KGS system, and since it's easy to play a lot of ranked games on KGS, ranks there stay up to date.  Even at the club I attend in the US where some people have AGA ranks, we usually use our KGS ranks to determine relative strength.

As long as you are in the 20-30k range, you will probably encounter some variation in the ranks.  I imagine there are 23ks you can beat in even games and 26ks who can beat you.  It's often just a matter of how skill sets match up.]

This stone is too far from the edge of the board to be useful at this point in the game... (See variation for explanation)]

`` Yes, this would have been a good point in the game to move on to another part of the board.  The border between your group and your opponent's group is solid now, so you should look around for the big moves.

A would be a very nice move right now.  There is a lot of open territory on the right side of the board, so staking a claim there now would be good.

An approach at B looks pretty good right now too since it attacks white's lone stone.]

(;B[dl]LB[cl:B][dl:A]C[`` Expanding this way isn't worth as much as a move on the right, but it's not a bad idea.

However, if you chose to keep expanding, it's important to make sure your stones are hard to cut apart.  Try to read situations like this out in your head a little.  Consider in your mind what would happen if white played D7.  Just reading ahead a move or two makes a big difference.

Of course, once you find a problem with one move, the real trick is find a move that does work.  Here the thing to do is try a knight's move at B.  (see variation)]

The problem is that it's too easy to cut a stone in the middle of the board off from the edge, and the middle of the board is the hardest place to keep your voice alive.

You still have good moves near the edge around A and B to consider at this point.]

`` That shows that you do a good job of judging the score.  If you had patched up this hole before white took advantage of it, you would have had the lead in this game.  But, since you can't really minimize damage here enough to save the game.  resigning was the right decision.

C[`` The most important thing for you to do right now is to start finding the big moves along the edges of the board, especially in the opening.

The other thing to do is to work on you reading skills a bit more.  Before you play each move thing about how you would respond in your opponent's place.  Try to picture the result and think about which of you will get the most out of the exchange.  Also, keep your eyes open for ataris and try to read out sequences of forcing moves.  The more you practice the further you will be able to read, and even as you get stronger, improving your reading skills will always help.

Good luck with your future games and your continued improvement!

[fp:4th][fq:3rd][fr:2nd][fs:1st]C[`` Most moves at the beginnings of games are played on the third or fourth line from the edge of the board.  (I labeled the lines so you can see what I mean.)

The reason for this is that the corners of the board are the easiest places to make territory, and moves near the edge help with that.  The third and fourth line are far enough away from the edge to surround a lot of territory, but close enough to the edge to make invading tough.  So, moves on those lines are very efficient and particularly useful early in the game.

Some examples of moves on the third and fourth lines that would be good right now are:

A - A very common move and the best choice right now.  It would make a strong presence for you on the right side of the board.

B - A good choice if you really want to approach one of your opponent's stones now.  It helps you expand the top of the board.

C - A good move if you want to stop your opponent from developing too big an area on the right.]
