GC[  Dear Joerg,

It was a fairly straightforward game to review, with not too many twists and surprises. I spent most of the time commenting on the middle game, since it was what decided this match.

  I avoided using japanese go terminology as often as possible, since I do not know how familiar you are with it. The following three appear a few times and you probably know them well already.  But it does not hurt to give definitions here.

  sente - not having to play the last stone in a local situation
  gote  - having to play the last stone in a local situation
  atari - threat to capture something with the next move

  Enjoy!
  Pekka Karjalainen]

C[Hello! It would be great if you could go through that game. I played black (20k) against 22k*

Fro

  I am happy if I can help you understand go a little better.  As a disclaimer, you will please note that I am only a 8k* on IGS.  I do know something about go, but I am not an expert.
    Pekka Karjalainen];B[pc];W[dp];B[cd];W[qp];B[qe]C[  Up to this all the moves are natural and need no special comment.
     Black aims at building the upper side or pincering a white approach stone at E16/E17 by making the corner enclosure.  Q15 and R14 are also possible moves with the same aim but subtle differences.]
;W[oq]C[  I do not like this move.  I would like to approach at E16 or make the Chinese fuseki shape with L4 instead as white.]

(;B[cn]C[  Please go back and study the variation for another possibility.

  Comparing this to the variation, I only prefer the variation a little bit more because it leaves white less options.  Yet it is hard to see (for me) how white should play here for the best result.

  I think that black should be well satisfied with his development in the opening so far.]
;W[fp]C[  A solid answer.  White runs a risk of becoming overconcentrated on the lower side if he keeps up like this.]
;B[bp]C[  This is very good, though white has the option of ignoring it and taking Q10/R10.]
;W[cq]C[  Safe and solid.  White's development is starting to look too slow.]
;B[cj]C[  This is a mistake, plain and simple.

  The correct move is to make the two-point extension at C9, or a form a higher position with D8.  Both are standard moves, securing black group completely.

  With this move black leaves a terrible weakness at C8, which white can aim at for a big advantage in any fighting in this area of the board.

  Perhaps white will not invade, black being forced to defend there instead.  In that situation, black's stones will end up being placed very ineffectively.  And white gets an advantage of a move elsewhere at the same time.

  Or white may have the chance to invade at C8.  This could mean black being cut into two weak groups or being pressed very low on the side.  Both are terrible results, bad enough to make one lose the game.

  For now, white need not to do anything about the weakness directly.  It will remain a problem for black for a long time to come.

  Without the B4 - C3 exchange this could be playable.  But it is a totally different tactic, with the position kept flexible and light.  You have to know what you are doing if you want to play like that.]
;W[ec]C[  E16 was also possible.  Seeing that the left side is thin and low with three stones on the third line I would prefer it greatly.]

(;B[gc]C[  Pincering is the only thing to do here.  Please go back and study the variation for a another possible pincer.]
;W[ee]C[  A natural response for white.]
(;B[cf]C[  This is too low and can be considered a rather bad mistake.  Please go back and see the variation.

  When you have more than one stone on the third line, stones played near them should be on the fourth line and vice versa.  Balance is important!

  The reason for this is that having a lot of stones on the fourth line makes it easy for the opponent to invade, often resulting one or more of one's own stones being wasted.  Similarly, a third-line position is often easily pressed down, with the stones
 again working ineffectively, not securing enough territory for the effort invested.

  Of course this is a bit advanced, and not the only cause of losses in beginners' games.  But it is still good to learn to make correct balanced shape right from the beginning.  I am sure that you will start to grasp the importance of 3rd/4th-line balanc
e better very soon.];W[jd]C[  White counterpincers.  This pincer is a bit loose, so black has plenty of chances to bring his own pincer stone out.  But the left side is problematic, as previously noted.]
;B[ge];W[ff]C[  E13 instead would likely be quite much better.  It would threaten C12 among other things.]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[gg]C[  It is dangerous to push enemy stones like this, when you have a thin position on the other side.  However, the wall you make should work well with the upper right corner, so if you are prepared to lose something on the left side this is quite playable
.

  K14 instead of this would make a nice development and attack the lone white stone at the same time.]
;W[gh]
(;B[hh]C[Fro:

I do not know, if that move is correct or maybe G13 should be at G14. I am not satisfied that White presses me, but I do not know, what to do against it.

Pekka:

  Please go back and study the variation for possible results of the cut at F12.

  White is trying to force you around and here he succeeds even though he should not have.  Unfortunately you played just too submissively here.  The later situation in the game shows that this was not a really bad move, but it still feels too mild to me.
      I am not sure what you mean by G13 being at G14.  However, if you were thinking of leaving holes in that wall you are making, I do not think it would have been a good idea at all.  And K14 is still a very good option.]
;W[gi];B[hi]C[  This is sente and an important point for both sides.  If you had followed this up correctly, it would have been a good solid move.]
;W[hd]C[  Another forcing move by white.  However, this is fully legitimate forcing move and it should be answered.      I cannot see what purpose this would serve for white, since he should go back and defend at G10 as soon as possible.]
;B[gd]C[  Correct and obvious.];W[mc]C[  Now white wants to live on the upper side.  You have little chance of stopping him after this, but you should be able to get compensation by building influence instead.

  The important thing in this position is that black can still cut white at F12.  White should really have played G10 instead of this.]
;B[jf]C[  This protects the cutting point at H13.  I would recommend J14 to do that, as it is more solid.  Often the most effective defending move is the most solid, which nevertheless seems very ineffective at first glance.  But if you have to add stones later
, you did not defend effectively.

  Earlier you did not have to worry about white H13, so K14 was what I recommended then.]
;W[ie];B[if]C[  Do you see what I meant now?  This is a free move for white, because K14 left the position thin.]
;W[le];B[lg]C[  This is good.  You are building influence and surrounding white.

  Black should be planning to cut at F12 very soon and this kind of move will make the resulting fight even more favorable for black.  You will see this later in an example.]
;W[ob]C[  This helps white to make eyes.  Very typical move to make when one needs to live.]
;B[pb]C[  This is a natural answer, but it is wrong when considering the whole board.  Here is a good rule of thumb:

  Never let your opponent live in sente.

  If it looks like he will be alive even after you answer his last move, do not answer it.  It may look quite big sometimes, and this is fairly big.  But it rarely is the biggest or best move for *you* to answer it.

  White's next move should bear this out quite obviously.];W[pj]
C[  White takes the key point on the right side.  Now, please consider what things would look like if you had gotten here first.]

(;B[qh]C[  Now you are letting your opponent dictate the game to you.  Please go back and study the variation to see what the cut at F12 leads to now.]
;W[ri]C[  I will now comment on some local matters for a few following moves.  You should keep in mind the cut at F12, however, which is the most important point of all in the current situation.]
;B[qi]C[  This move is pretty pointless.  White will be happy to connect.  It is an example of a bad forcing move by black.]
;W[qj];B[rh]C[  This was the move you wanted to make anyway.  It should be natural to make it at once, and leave such exchanges as R11 for R10 as potential for later.  You only managed to strengthen white more than need be.]
;W[rj]C[  This is very slow.  Black will not capture at S10 anytime soon, since it is a gote move.  White answers with S9 and there is no immediate threat after black T11.]
;B[oc]C[  O18 could very well be more effective.  It is likely to end in gote for black in the usual case, but here white group is still weak.  Perhaps you could study the situation further on your own?]
;W[nb];B[nc];W[md]C[  This is another example of ineffective forcing technique.  Sure, white is pretty much forced to answer the last black move, but at the same he is strengthened greatly.  He has reason to be grateful for black.]
;B[nf];W[hj]C[  You still could cut at F12...];B[ij];W[hk]C[  Even now...]
;B[ik];W[fk]C[  This does not stop the cut either.];B[dk]C[  That thinness at work again.  With C10 at C9 there would be no need for this.]
;W[jp]C[  How about that cut at F12 now?

  OK.  You really missed it completely, so it is not fair for me to carry on about it.  I apologize for being repetitive and rude - but I wanted to make it clear to you what you might have done instead.  This time I will not give a variation, but I sugges
t that you study it on your own.

  Please put a black stone at F12 and carry on from there!]
;B[hl]C[  Most of the moves you make here are nice solid moves reducing white territory slightly.  Seeing how big the white lower side is, that is not enough and the moves are the losing moves of the game.]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[gm]C[  Locally, this is good.  You do not answer the forcing move of J7 immediately, because you can play a forcing move of your own.]
;W[fm];B[il]C[  Now it is proper to connect.  But please remember I am only commenting on the local line of play now.]
;W[km];B[kl]C[  When these kinds of moves are good, jumping with a move like M9 is often moreefficient.  Here white makes a huge territory, so it is just as pointless as this.]
;W[ll]
(;B[lk]C[Fro:

Same thing. White presses and I do not know how to react in a less defensive way. I have no idea how to cut the white group.

Pekka:

  Here it is more risky to cut than previously.  White is already very strong on the lower side so you face a more difficult fight after the cut.

  However, in this position you should stop and try a quick count of the prospective territories.  It should tell you plainly enough that if you do not cut and start a fight you are going to lose by a big margin.

  So, cut and decide the game by a fight or don't cut and lose quietly.  Which one do you prefer?  Here is the question you should be asking yourself in this kind of situation.

  I have give a possible variation for the cut.  Please go back and look it over.  The situation is worthy of extensive study, if you are so inclined.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj];W[ok];B[oi]C[Fro:

I let White press and press. What to do?

Pekka:

  Do not let that happen the next time!  It is quite clear now that there is nothing to be done for this game anymore.  The cut at F12 no longer gives you much, with white sacrificing couple of stones in the correct line of play.  Please study the situati
on and see if you agree with me.

  There does appear to be a chance of making something happen with black F6 though.  What do you think?

  On more general matters:

  I hope that you did not get the impression that it is automatically bad being pressed or forced in other ways by your opponent.  Sometimes you even might not have the other options.  But if you let your opponents get away with it all the time, you will  have very difficult time with all your games.]
;W[fn]C[  It seems that white thought F6 was really important...]
;B[dc]C[  You have a lost game now and should resign.  Making moves like this has little point, since you just cannot catch up to white.

  Overview:

  You made several good moves in the opening and generally had the right idea about the direction of play.  There were few obvious mistakes which I pointed out for you.  The worst of them was letting white force you too much when middle-game started.

  When you learn more good lines of play and make less mistakes you will naturally improve.  However, more important for you would be to learn to avoid being forced when you should not be forced.  There are many examples of forcing situations in this game
 and I have commented on many of them.  Please study them further and look for similar situations in other games you play or study.  This should have a positive effect on your skill.

  The concept of a forcing move is very subtle and important part of go theory.  There is a lot more to be said on the subject than I can hope to present in this review.  I hope that my humble efforts have helped your understanding a little and made the g
ame more enjoyable.

  Sincerely,
  Pekka Karjalainen

  Black also has many other options in addition to this.]))
(;B[fh]C[  There is no question of ladders or nets here.  White is short of liberties, so black can escape with the atari of F11.]

(;W[eh];B[fi];W[ei];B[gj]C[  White cannot save both groups.  Sacrificing the two stones is extremely painful, but I see no other plausible way for white to play.]
;W[ej];B[dg]C[  Another good forcing move.  White cannot afford not to answer.]
;W[eg];B[en]C[  White is under severe attack.  Now, black is still a bit thin on the left side because of that move I warned you about earlier.

  Still, black can be well satisfied with the marvellous shape made by capturing two stones at G10.  It is just beautiful.

  What it means in practice is that black's stones in the upper center are all alive and very thick.  White cannot do *anything* to them anymore.  In contrast the heavy white group on the left will be a tremendous burden on white's shoulders and a clear t
arget for attack.

  Now black aims attack white on the large scale with G6 and J6.  Only the weakness at C8 has to be dealt with first - another example of how a bad move can haunt one for a long time.]

(;B[fh]C[  This seems to be a position where black can start a fight with confidence.  A possible continuation follows.]
;W[hh]C[  When cut, first put your head up.  It is good style.

  The reason is that when a string of stones has more liberties, it is more stable.]
;B[jf]C[  White cannot cut the connection between K14 and G14 yet, with the two stones being too weak.  Please verify this for yourself.]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[ei];B[fj]C[  White has no effective way to attack the cutting stones after this.  They may look weak, but so is white at G12 and K16.  The left side is a bit problematical, but black can even afford to lose the corner if he can take a big upper side in return.

  Based on this we can feel confident in black's cut at F12.  White was asking for trouble with the move at G12.]

;W[eb];B[ef];W[hc]C[  Sacrificing the pincer stone makes the left side look a lot more healthy.  Black has the sente now, so the game is still far from being white's go.

  This white move is very important.  White cannot expect to be safe without the black sacrifice being securely captured.]
)
(;W[ef]C[  You may ask what happens if white pushes like this...]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[jc]C[  Pushing and pincering this way is not very good for white.  Black's left side has been solidified and is not small in scale, so he need not worry greatly about white's framework on the upper side.  Were I black here, I would consider following up with
 K15, prepared to sacrifice the stone at G17 freely.

  White's strategy is not sound.])))
(;B[ic]C[  A three-point pincer.  Attacking white severely at G17 may not be the best choice, since black's stone is left too far from the right side position afterwards.  Here the distance is almost ideal, and white is still under a pincer attack.

  It is important to consider the placement of the pincer stone carefully.  G17 is more aggressive, but is that required?]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dd];B[ce];W[cb];B[dg]C[  This is a possible continuation.  White is now settled, with B18 and G17 remaining as equivalent options to make life in need.

  Black's left side is not very solid, so white has many options for his strategy.  Consider having the C10 stone at C9 now.  Doesn't that look like a much better shape?]
))
(;B[pj]C[  Black takes the key point.  White would like to extend here from his corner enclosure too, but it is not possible anymore.  Furthermore, the upper side is threatening to become very big, so white will have to enter there.

  R10 is about the same, but I prefer the higher position myself.  If you prefer to emphasize territory, R10 is your move.]
;W[jc]C[  Splitting the upper side at K17 is probably best for white now.]
;B[lc];W[gc]C[  A two-point extension is a best way to settle stones quickly.  Please note that white had room to make that on either side of K17.]
;B[ec]C[  White should now defend his two stones with a move at K15.  That would let black have the opportunity to make a big move elsewhere.  C6, C10, D10, P15 and K3 are all possible.

  Playing elsewhere now runs the risk of letting black attack at J16, aiming at closing the white group in with small life.  This would be a very good result for black.]
