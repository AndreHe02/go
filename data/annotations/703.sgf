C[I (strombrg, IGS 14k*) am submitting this game for review. I was black. My opponent was 11k*.    
    
    
JMR My review. Interesting game - very instructive. You have a good attitude. I make lots of little tactical points, but there are two very important principles, both commented on at move 98. Also move 60, and a nice point at move 243.    
    
Enjoy. Good luck.    
    
I hope this is comprehensible. My WinMGT refuses to work, so I am having to use GoWrite, and I think the sgf is not quite standard.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq]
(;B[co]C[My teacher feels that preventing the shimari is a very big opening move. Does the reviewer agree?          JMR Yes. What you have played is probably fine, but 4th line stones are for attack, and it would be more consistent, to play on the fourth line here. The resultant group would be more use in attacking.]
;W[cp]
(;B[cl]LB[bo:A][bn:B]C[I did this for lack of anything better. I really expected white to hane at A, because I really cannot counterhane at B very well.]
;W[gq];B[bo]
(;W[bp]C[JMR Too small at this stage. One of the 3 places in the variation would be bigger, and more normal.]
;B[fc];W[ec]C[White likes this move, and I still don't know how to handle it.          JMR Below 11.]
;B[ic];W[nc]C[JMR Better to approach from the other side of the corner.]
;B[lc]C[Dual purpose move (extension and pincer) - so good play?    
    
JMR Yes indeed! Ideal.];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[cg]
(;
(;B[fb]C[Again, I get to white's hane in what seems to be sente. Am I correct in thinking that white probably should have played the hane?          JMR If you play BELOW 11, then W would not hane as it is gote. This is, however, a very big move.          You should instead attack the weak W group, to build your territory and influence.]
;W[eb];B[qk]C[JMR Good];W[qn]
(;B[qp]C[I was reluctant to use white's diagonal play - It seems I've gotten into trouble doing that in the past. But perhaps it's a good thing sometimes?          JMR (Capping W16 first is still good).    
    
Normal way to play is to attach, W stands up, B extends along the bottom, and now W has a 2stone group that is "heavier", i.e. needs looking after, rather than a single stone that he can abandon. But what you have played is fine. It is in accord with the principle of not playing in contact with the stone you are attacking. (Variation).]
;W[on];B[mp]C[I'm hoping to extend and put pressure on white's right-hand group at the same time. Does it work that way? Is there a bigger point? Please, if at any time I make a move and you see a bigger point, don't hesitate to point it out.          JMR This is the right idea, but slightly too far. A 1-space jump is right here. Two spaces on the 4th line is too far, usually.          Overal assessment: W has slightly more of solid territory in two groups, plus two weak groups; B has almost as much solid territory, and much more potential territory.]
;W[qh]
(;B[qg]C[I get over my distaste for the diagonal attachment. What else could I do?          JMR Here it is not a good idea. The ordinary response to this - to the left of 28 - helps W out into the centre, and tends to surround B above and below. See variation.]

(;W[ql]C[JMR not necessary. If worried, the variation would be better.]
;B[jq]C[A large point, but the W group at the top is crying out to be given a hard time. The B group on the left is weaker, and it would be better to extend from this. If W extends to here it induces you to play below 27 and patch up your weakness there, which is considerable now that the W stones above are so strong.]
;W[ke]
(;B[nd]C[Is this worthwhile?          JMR It is axiomatic in Go that you do not play in contact with stones that you are attacking. See variation.           This is a disastrous move. One move ago there was a thin W group asking to be cut, and this helps him to become strong at your expense.      ...]
;W[md];B[od];W[mc]C[... and now W14 and 46 (and 18) are strongly linked in sente.]
;B[me];W[ld]LB[me:A][lc:B]C[Oops. I didn't see that coming. White has attacked A and B simultaneously, no?]
;B[kc]C[This seems the bigger of the two. Correct?          JMR Yes. But the capture of W16 is very small, so the idea of B51 was mistaken.]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[oe];B[of]C[JMR This is another bad move. B55 and 17 are already joined. It does not matter when B 51 is captured. You should tenuki (play elsewhere), i.e. extend from your group on the left.]
;W[le];B[ci]
(;W[pe]C[This is sente, but small? Is it worthwhile to play this, this early in the game?          JMR It is important to distinguish between a move that the opponent must respond to, and sente. It is the SEQUENCE which is sente or not. Since he connects the three stones on (W62) after your block, it is NOT sente for him to play 60.]
;B[qe]
(;W[me]C[JMR This too is very small. If B captures here it is worth 3 points in sente, (i.e. if W recaptures one stone) or a maximum of 5 points. Any of the big end-game points at the edge is worth more than that.    
    
Ignore the variation for a bit and look at it later.];B[hr]
C[Here I go wild trying to play every sente move I can think of. Is this short-sighted?          JMR No it is exactly right - although W should not always respond as he does.]
;W[gr];B[ro];W[rn];B[bh]C[JMR It is clear that this move (67) and 65 are similar moves. If White lets Black have all these "sente" moves, Black gains 10 points each time.    
    
It is difficult at first, but unless the life of a group is threatened, one should look for a similarly large move elsewhere. B65 does not threaten the life of the group above, so W 66 should not respond, but play at 67, SHARING these big "sente" points.

;B[ir];W[sm];B[so]C[JMR Above 19 (B91) is bigger.];W[rm]C[JMR Ditto.]
;B[qb];W[pc];B[pa]C[I thought this would be sente also, but obviously I was mistaken.]
;W[oc];B[qd];W[oa];B[qa]C[Gote.];W[do]C[Here's where my flurry of small-sente moves starts to hurt, maybe. White finds it kind of easy to shut me in.          JMR W gets more territory in the middle because of your low plays at the beginning - B 9 was not here (98) but down towards the edge. So now W can play these expanding moves, many of them in sente.    
    
 No, you did fine by your sente moves, gaining many many points. [Count all the enclosed territory, and compare with my variation at move 63 in which W takes all these moves - see several lines below\].    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
I make it about

So B winning by about 22, although less as W has a little more central influence. A swing of about 30 points compared to W getting all those sente yose plays!]
;B[cn];W[fd]C[JMR Again, this is where you should have gone when W played kosumi-tsuke at 12.]

;B[iq]C[Here I'm trying to prevent at least one of these forcing moves from white, that have the effect of shutting me in a bit.          JMR Right attitude, but wrong occasion. There is not now much territory to be made in the centre. You both missed a tactical point here, for a while. Variation coming up.          At the head of 102 (above it) pushes back his territory, and starts to surround some in the middle yourself.]

(;W[ip];B[jp];W[io];B[jo]C[Is there something bigger than this drive to get ahead?          JMR 111 is the right idea. (Although there is the tactical error at the left edge). You are limiting the territory to the left. Imagine what it would look like with a W stone at 111.]
;W[dl];B[ck];W[dk];B[dj];W[ej]
(;B[ei]C[JMR Looks suspect to me: you are helping him to surround the territory including B107. It is hard to say though. On the other hand 117 stops the development of any territory above it in sente. W is clearly going to get more central territory one way or another. See variation.]

JMR  A is not necessarily sente, since the cut is not important: the stones to the right of 107 are safely joined up.  Black would save 2 points with 2 plays.  Not very big. 217 is worth 2 points with a ONE stone difference.]
