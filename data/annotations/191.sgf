(;W[ef]C[e14 is possible, but going for the corner with  c17 is usually better.]
;B[fd];W[bd]C[b16 is a bad move. White should keep the  option of invading the corner later.]
;B[cc];W[dj];B[eh];W[gf]L[hd]C[Black should  play at A. The two black stones can't be attacked very strongly because
of the white weakness here (see variation).]
(;B[gh];W[hc]L[hd]C[White  should not invade, but take care of the outside group (h16 seems correct).  Black should lean against the invasion
stone and build thickness to attack the c14 group (see variation).]
(;B[he]C[The black move is not good.];W[hg];B[ic]M[gh]L[ec][jc]C[runski: I thought if black didn't play here white could form  a small group by playing 'A' or 'B'.
jm: But the real problem is on the outside group.];W[hh];B[fj]L[ej]C
[runski:  I thought about the attachment at 'A', but that would strengthen white.
jm: the black move induces a white reinforcement, anyway.];W[dl];B[hi];W
[ii];B[hj];W[jh]C[The black central group is now strong enough. Black  should switch elsewhere, at d4 for example (see variations)]

(;B[fl];W[em]L[ep]C[The Black group is too strong for e7 being an effective attack, and White  perspectives on the left side are not good,
because of the black c12 stone. White should play at A.];B[bj]C[B  10 is a move on the second line. It would be better to play on the lower  side.]
;W[cd]L[dc]C[runski: It seems like black should answer at 'A'.
jm: I do not agree.]
(;B[bc]L[ec]C[Black has to play here if the white peep at A  doesn't succeed (see variations).]

(;W[ci]L[bh][cg]C[Black should answer at  A of B. It is now apparent that the b10 move was a mistake. C11 is also a  dubious move that makes
black stronger..];B[bi];W[dh];B[dg];W[di];B[cg];W[ee]L[ed]C[A black  move at A is absolutely necessary. One has to accept the cut.]

(;B[ed]C[runski: It seems to me black  should play variation 'b'.
jm: The black move seems normal to me.];W[db];B[eb]C[runski: It seems like this  isn't good.
jm: I think it's normal.];W[ec]L[fc]C[Black should block at A (variation).]

(;B[fb];W[fc];B[gc]L[gd]C[Black A would probably be better.];W[gd];B
[ge];W[gb];B[fe];W[ff];B[df]L[bf]C[This move is bad, it just remove one  liberty to the black strings. Black can play directly at A for the same  result.]
;W[de];B[bf];W[ce];B[hd];W[gc];B[fm]C[runski: Not only  black lost a lot in the corner, white's center group is settled, and black  can no longer make profit on the
upper side by attacking it.
jm: I agree. White has 20 points in the upper left corner.
The black move is bad, as it strengthen the last weak white group.];W[en]
L[ep]C[Better at A.];B[qj];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]L[pe]C[runski: I  meant to play 'A', but I clicked too fast.  I think white can
destroy black's upper side as in variation 'b'.
jm: I think the black move is ok.]
(;W[re];B[qf]C[runski: I switched  plan, and played different from the joseki.  White took advantage of that.]
;W[pb]L[ob]C[Black must play at A.]
(;B[nc];W[rf]
(;B[ob]L[qg]C[runski: I think  playing 'A' is better.
jm: I don't think so. The black wall is useless because of k12, and white  destroy the
upper side.];W[qg]C[runski: Now black is in bad shape.];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[rg];B[of]L[pf][og]C[runski: I think this is another bad move.  Maybe 'A' is  better?
jm: "In face of a double hane, cut once and extend". The normal move is at B.  Anyway, the two black stones on the left side are
nearly lost.];W[og];B[pf];W[qi]L[nf][pi]C[runski: I think white should  atari at 'A'.
jm: A is not atari. If white A, black cuts anywhere.
Black should atari at B first.]
(;B[oh]L[pi];W[pi];B[ng];W[pj]L[oq]C[The white move is useless. White should play elsewhere, for example make a  shimari at A.]
;B[op];W[po]L[pn]C[White move is strange. The normal move  is at A.]

 runski 9k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[pq];W[kq]
(;B[iq]M[fm]L[mq][pm]C[Dubious move.  I would play at A as a stronger black group is a pre-requisite for a black  invasion around B. Black can invade
the lower left side later, thanks to the marked stone's influence (see  variation in preceding node).]
;W[mq];B[fq];W[oo]L[rr]M[mq]C[White A instead would be  terrible. In running, black would help white to secure the left side and make  the marked stone
alive.];B[rr];W[ro];B[mp]L[np]C[White A seems possible (variation).]

(;W[lp];B[no];W[ln];B[mn]L[nn][pm][ko][nq]C[runski: Shouldn't 'A' be better?  That will  support an invasion at 'B' better? (jm: better=later?)
jm: Actually, I don't think A or the black move makes a large difference for  an invasion at B. No invasion is possible as long as
black corner is weak. D is urgent. Anyway, A is more solid and gives a  kikashi at C later.]
;W[fn]L[nq][lm]C[White A or B, continuing the  attack on the white group, seems more normal.]
;B[lo]C[Black has  nearly nothing to win with this ko, and a whole corner to loose. :(]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[mo];B[cb]C[runski: A complete misread.];W[np];B[nq];W[nn]
C[runski: I lost too much here :(];B[sq];W[rp];B[nr];W[bl]L[ib][ni]
[qb]C[White has around 20 points in upper left (A is white's sente), 40 point  on right side, that can get bigger with B.
Black has at most 30 points on upper side (if he plays the C gote move), 10  in lower side, not much on left side and on left part
of lower side.
Black last chance is a splitting attack in lower left.];B[dp];W[cp];B[do]

(;B[jk]L[gj]C[runski: I think blocking at 'A' is better?
Blocking at A is terrible, see variation on preceding move.];W[gi];B[fi]
;W[gj]C[Now that the splitting attack failed, black should resign.];B[bk]
;W[am];B[ah];W[er]L[ib][mi]C[This move is gote. A or B are better.]
;B[ol]C[runski: I thought black was way behind, and the only chance was to  invade white's right side.  Even if black could make a
live group, I think white still probably wins the game.
jm: This invasion is pointless. Black can do nothing as his stone is  surrounded by formidable white forces.]
