(;B[gq];W[eq]
(;B[jq]C[with these moves, black remains competitive on territory alone, altho your thickness is superior.]
;W[oo]LB[lq:A][qh:B]C[P5 would be the orthodox move in this position afterwards. (the reason is that it is the key point for black's framework of territory - if he takes it, he grows incalculably stronger on both sides). there are a number of possible joseki from here. with your superior center power, i think you _deserve_ to win, but you would have to use it most effectively in order to eliminate black's territorial lead. after the P5 sequence plays out, you will have two possible targets:

if black defnds on the right, you should be able to cut off his extension on the bottom in reply. Then you will be able to aim at moves such as H2 and K5 to force his group to live small. K5 would probably be the best aim, once you have cut those 2 stones off on the side, as it would build your central framework. Also, even if black plays a one space jump at K5 (if your P5 stone ends in gote), you should be able to cap at K7 and look forward to some attacking moves.

If black defends on the bottom, then you will want to cut down on the right, and then try to invade at B12. you will need to peep at R15 or get a supporting stone at R8 first, before you can play a move like B. this tough invasion will be good afterwards tho, because your center is so powerful.

despite what i said before, i'll show just 2 possible sequences, highlighting both of these ideas]

(;B[pn]C[i show a joseki for the move at O3 (which is the natural followup once Q6 is played). however, it is dynamic to create aji on the right now.

an example:]
(;W[nq];B[op];W[np];B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[or];B[pr];W[nr]C[this is one possible joseki. (black has other replies than P4.

since you have gone for thickness, it is necessary to vigorously break into his sides, like this. it is a little sad that his right has swelled so greatly after this sequence, so maybe a more dynamic plan is needed than this]
)

;W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[lq];W[lp];B[kp];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn]C[with R15 in place, and Q10, you have more to look forward to with the O3 sequence. R17/R16 offer life, and you can look forward to playing a move such at O10, or Q8/Q9 to turn Q10 into a reduction. in a sense you can view the corner and the reduction at Q10 now as miai. 

keep in mind black has many other replies, and there are possibly better plans than this for white, but i am limited in vision by my strength]

(;B[np];W[pp]
(;B[pq];W[qo];B[rp];W[mn]C[this is a standard reduction technique once O4 is played. (i did THIS one from memory, since it is so common).

(;B[pn];W[pm]C[if black tries to peep, connecting would make o5 a burden again. so you must remember the sequence for o5, and resist such a devilish tactic. remember, your real aim is to invade top right somehow. (R17 would be good immediately after the reduction, for instance)]

(;B[qq];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[ql]C[i am showing this just in case you wonder about r3. i would not have considered this, but i consulted a book of reduction joseki to determine the best answer for you.

i would play p5 without hesitation in the initial situation where i advised it, but i have not learned all the joseki yet, true! this result in particular is considered very poor for black]

(;B[jp]C[P5 is still the move, but i realized that K4 might be preferable to K3 for black, to keep balance of 3rd/4th line on bottom. refer to K3 for white's followups [they are unchanged\]]

(;W[fg]C[F13 is best. solidly connect your stones, and J12 becmoes a target soon.]
))
(;W[cc]C[C17 is the best move. it connects to c14 and leaves little bad aji behind. the peep at e18 cannot make black an eye and is small yose. pushing thru at E17 is no good. you should look for more efficient connection moves in situations like this. 

connecting solidly at E17 might seem to be a basically good move, but it left more bad aji in the corner.]
