C[I'm Witols, white. I'm rather bad at go, but I'd really want to get better. Please note all my mistakes and show me moves that would be more beneficial.

Hi Witols, happy to help you if I can :o) . 9x9's narrow space makes me a little uncomfortable though, now ! Go is much more than local struggle and little combinations, so my first advice would be to try games on larger goban soon enough, for you will see that go is wonderfully enjoyable with tactics and massive fights, territory and influence, and so on !
Well, let's see this one already...];B[cg];W[gc]C[Although the best 1st move on 9x9 is proven to be the 5-5, black let it open. On 9x9, having the first move is such a gigantic advantage...]
;B[gg]
(;W[cc]C[there, although good-looking, I guess this move is not optimal :
- you may play C6 to let your legitimate greed catch a little more. On 19x19, C6 would be a "komoku" opening, almost an enclosure, especially with the G7 stone not so far (see variant).
You may then tell me, "Hey buddy, how could I possibly have read the C6 play as deeply as you show me ?" I would totally agree, but thing is, C6 is a standard 4-3 move, and impossible to approach with the contact move C7 to steal the corner. That is a common fact, you needn't read it, you may just know it :o) .

3-point extensions for 2 single stones on the 3rd line are usually overplays, because it is possible for B to cut in E7. There, with a B stone on E7, B could flee unconditionnally (!), and it would be tricky to believe both live, although they are both 3-3 stones.
Hard to believe ? Too complicated ? Give you a little time to experiment it by yourself...]
;B[ee]C[I'm wondering if this tengen move in such situations is a good one. Could I get a stronger player's opinion?:)

A central move is a good move right now. Don't know if it's the best, I guess not :
- I like E7, told you, although maybe premature. Invasion is usually not a bad thing, but if it gives W too much strengh, you may avoid it. Big point : I admit E7 is very aggressive and may be shifty if not read through in a fair way. So, playable I guess, but dangerous ^^ .
- That's weird, but then I would seriously consider W E3 ! Aggressive also, but it should end in killing one B corner. Sthg is obvious : B has set up 2 elephant steps : double-diagonal extensions (C3-E5, G3-E5), and W can cut by D4 or F4 as well and successfully wrap one of the 2 corners. Bad thing, though : B can do some wreckage as well, with E7. And B's tengen gives him the critical advantage, if well used.

See variants ! :o)]
(;W[ec]C[Your play. At this point, you lost. Not because E7 is definitely a bad move : it is sound and efficient locally. But even with a calm E3, B has such a great position at tengen that he could ensure an easy win. You must... you have to prove E5 is an overplay. Letting B take the center without even battling for it lacks ambition here ^^ .
Even side plays aren't sufficient, as B may play symetrically and still own the tengen. Depends on the komi also. But after E7, the tengen is sooo heavy !]
;B[gd];W[ce]C[Please have a look at the board. Where is W ? Where is B ? where are the potential territories ?... The pivot would be  D6, giving B a bigger area, but :
- G6 is not a good move, H6 is a nice follow-up if B doesn't makes it more solid right now.
- D4 is huge for W !
So G5 made it at least a close game, and C5 not only "clean" to the eye, but nice also, presumably forcing D4 and leading to a good yose.]
;B[fc]C["Ouch !" would be the word. Though F7 being stingy as a sacrifice, D4 was much more needed, I would say.]
;W[fd]
(;B[fb]C[H7, sacrificing F7, is much much bigger, and you could have lost a corner. Sacrificing stones is very useful sometimes : see variant :o) .]
;W[gb];B[ed]
(;W[eb]C[This one is a mistake, I would say. See why ? OK, F6 is atari, but does that mean it is dead ? Please take this one back and read through it. Why B's E6-E5-G6 shicho doesn't work on F6 ?
I guess you saw B D7, but it is not so deadly if W can take F7-F8, holding the side.]
;B[fe];W[cf]C[D4 D4 D4 D4 :oP
This must become almost like a reflex : double-diagonal extension --> cut ! C3-E5 elephant step --> cut. Just seek this structure in your games, and see each time not only why cut, but above all : why not ? ^^ It is usually a perfect occasion to cut weak groups, invade or grab some points or find grip in your opponent's structure. Almost always a good idea, and always to consider. Then, my advice would be to keep it in mind !


There is a more urgent move there, though, and a kind of sente, although D4 is the next key spot to settle. Can you connect your G7-G8 group ? It can live in the corner, not enough eye space. Answer is : yes, you can. So don't lose your group and its whole corner, just play it easy and connect first :o).]
;B[fa];W[ga]C[Not only a loss of time : once B cut, this group is dead. If you don't play there, you die as well. So, better not play it !]
;B[df]C[There he goes. You can't win anymore. Sorry...];W[de]
;B[eg]C[D3 better. See why ?];W[bg];B[dd];W[cd];B[dc];W[db]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[ea];W[da];B[fd];W[cb];B[hc]C[B's mistake as well. Dead group, so loss of time. There is only one playable move for both...]
;W[hd];B[he];W[ic]C[Don't worry, I know isay many baaad things about what you did, but time will come and you will read the game as if it were a great thriller. Play on, and try anticipating. When you play with better players (and it's a no-brainer : it will help you badly !), just ask for them to show you "good" and "bad" shapes. Common sequences and eventually joseki will become more familiar to you before you could notice it !]
;B[id];W[hb];B[ib]C[All these moves are pointless, as you may see.]
;W[ci]C[This is the last point.];B[di];W[bi];B[dh];W[bf]C[Unneeded, so this gives up a point.]
;B[ha]C[I resigned here. Could anything be done? I'd be thankful for any advice.



Hopefully this whole crap variants i showed you are not too many, or too complicated !! You can ask me for more comments at any time : azzerrtyyuiiopp@yahoo.fr or "mianreg" on kgs.

Last, but not least : key advice.
- Don't get killed !
- Don't get cut ! Although 2 living groups can be cut without any disturbance (it's like a sword cutting through a river... Doesn't stop the water at on any side !), this is almost always useful and efficient to connect. So, don't get cut...
- Try not to form empty triangles (experience will help...). For more detail, see there what it is :
http://senseis.xmp.net/?EmptyTriangle
(http://senseis.xmp.net/ is a great site, you may browse it if you like, it can help you understand the game and some concepts and tools, although playing games is the major way to improve...)
Empty triangles might be good ones, but just sometimes... So, before making an empty triangle (and you did in this game, I saw you ! :oP ), you should analyze it and be sure it is an efficient shape in the game you play.

Carefully seeing pro games can help a lot, even now as you are beginning. .sgf files of pro games are easy to find in the Internet.


Hope I will meet you soon on kgs ! Bye !! Have fun !])

(;B[ca];W[fb];B[ea]C[Here, W could start a ko on B9. Logic of ko is, whether I win it and that's full house, or I lose it and get a compensation with a good ko threat : that is, a presumably forcing move in order to take the ko back if the opponent answers indeed to the threat. That's why finding good ko threats can be most important in a game. Here, B can't afford to lose a B9 ko, so W can play an enormous ko threat and win, for B can't reasonably answer. See the following, for instance.]
;W[ba]C[see, if W can win the ko and just play C8 after a A9-then-B9-again exchange, game over !
I let a whole bunch of variants down there. It may help you, maybe not, but you can find some tiny helpful ideas if I made it clear enough...]
;B[aa]C[Forced.];W[eg]C[This one is obvious to me. It ruins any hope of continuous territory for B on the south. That was already there, but as B can't answer, for W couldn't be attacked in such a big way to have him let the ko back to B, W has already set up a big big position as compensation for his 2 lost stones.]

;W[bf];B[ae]C[Well, just to say : if B lets C3 die, game over. G5 or sthg would't be enough,and E5 is definitely not the critical move to attack E3. so let's say B pushes along the edge, to try to find a cut...
I guess the best move here may be H6 for B (I may be wrong, well I'm not a pro ^^), but B obviously loses the game with it also.]
;W[af]C[If W doesn't mess it up, B's stone on C3 is dead. See B fleeing by D4 (variant). B has to kill E3, arguably he just can't : it's easy for W to connect.]
