C[Hello Mario. There are three main take aways from this game. 

1. I have some advice for your play in the beginning.

2. You can learn from black's moves in the middle of the game to cut off your white group.

3. Finally, I will review black's failure to kill you on the top left. 

Let me know if you have any questions, or would like to see more variations!

TR[ik]C[At this point, I think you should take a look at the big picture on the board. Right now, you have a nice solid base with all four of your stones. Where as black's stone at J3 is very weak, and L10 still needs more enforcement. Black's next move is at J5. He's making a run for it. I would at this point pursue black, knowing that even if I can't kill him below, I may build up a strong base for attacking the top right.]
;B[ii];W[ci]C[Refer to my comments earlier. I think this move is too slow. Your white stones aren't in much danger, and by playing here black gets to respond at D6, which not only reinforces him on the left, but also makes him one step closer to connecting to J5.]
;B[dh];W[gc]C[Good idea here. Black is mostly safe on the bottom, so you move on to the top. I would be more aggressive here with a J11. Try and leverage your strength on the right. By playing here, you let black do a dual purpose move at J11. Not only are his stones on the top right now secure, but he has also started the attack.]
;B[ic];W[hb];B[hd];W[kk];B[hh];W[ke]C[At this point it was more important to make a move in the top left. Your stones up there are too weak to leave alone.]
;B[gd];W[hc]C[I'm not sure what you're thinking with this move. This isn't creating any space for you to live on the top. Now black is one step ahead in trying to box you in.]

;B[ib];W[dc]C[Watch and learn carefully from black here. Your white stones don't have two eyes right now, so you're trying to make a run for it. Black does an excellent job cutting your white stones off. Notice how he plays cautiously in the top left, but still doesn't give up any eyes.]
;B[cb];W[dd];B[cc];W[de]C[Black is not afraid to let you move down because of his earlier play at D6.]
;B[bf];W[cf];B[bg];W[ce];B[be];W[bi];B[gj]C[Watch and learn from black again here. See how he attacks you in the bottom left and right. But his real objective is to cut off the path of escape. He uses the attack in the left to accomplish his real purpose.]

;W[ji];B[jj];W[ki];B[di];W[cj];B[ih];W[ee]C[Black did a good job up until here sealing your white stones off. I'm sure you'll want to do the same thing to your opponents, so make sure to learn from black's example.

Now here you pull a fast one on black in the top left! Pulling off life here was no easy task. I'll spend the rest of the review showing what black should have done to stop you.]

;W[fe];B[ge];W[cg];B[ea];W[fa];B[da];W[ia];B[tt]C[As a beginner, I think it's good not to give up too early. You reaped the benefits of that in this game. Your opponent is also raw, and might make a mistake that both of you can learn from. Be sure to learn from his mistakes trying to kill your group here. Also, keep in mind the advice I gave you in the beginning about attacking. The ncie thing about a 13x13 board is that every move can affect the whole board. An attack on one side of the board can strengthen your group for an attack on the other.]
