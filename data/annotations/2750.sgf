C[Hello,
I am 5k* on IGS.
I have Black in this gameand my opponent (white) is stronger than me.]
;C[Zee,
Thanks for the chance to comment your game. Remember only a high ranking pro know the truth about go. My comments are only useful if they help stimulate your own thinking in interesting directions.

;W[hp]C[I thought this is unusual for this fuseki.
I was expecting a play on the right side.

W6: I think C6 is common.];B[fo]C[I decided to come out

B7: normal to split White since you are favorable to counter play on the bottom due to the lower right corner being black.]
;W[en]
(;B[dr]SQ[en][jp]C[trying to get a base

Yes, Zee, a normal way to think, but because E6 is on the fifth line and not at D6 which is joseki, White is being greedy. White is making the left bigger than normal. This shape is usually seen with the stones all moved one line to the left.

Frankly I would have to ask Mr. Y about this one because I am not sure how to handle the unusual white move; however, solidfying the white position by exchanging D2 for C3 doesn't seem to be good; rather you want to leave the white position a bit thin so perhaps don't touch it. I think K4 might be a reasonable counter-play for Black (but still not sure). C7 may be too early for Black to counter play right now. I don't see the push at E5 and cut working tactically. See variation.]
;W[dj]SQ[cq]C[I expected W to take C3

Me too.];B[cq]C[I did this instead of H2 because I thought it was bigger]
;W[po]TR[en][dp]C[First White did not directly answer D2, then tenukied again after C3. This cannot be right. Black can tenuki Q5 and try to punish the two marked white stones with D8. This requires a reading. Of course, if you cannot see how to punish White right away, then you should continue normally.]
;B[np];W[lp]
(;B[qp]CR[nn]C[B15: better at O6 to separate and keep the pressure on all white stones?

This is also consistent with the principle of moving the inside stones outside prior to making a base.]
;W[no];B[mq]C[this may be slack
I do not know if I can tenuki here?

You need to separate White if possible. N3 is a defensive move in a position where you need offense because you are stronger in this locality.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[nc];B[lc]CR[pf]C[This may be where I lost the game.
Please advise if it would be better to play Q14

Normally you pincer when you have some support in the other corner (in this case D16); M17 is saying the top is more important than the right, which is not clear to me here. Q14 seems better locally.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd];B[ld];W[le];B[kc];W[ic]C[I expected W to play the joseki at K16

Yes, J17 seems thin.]
(;B[jd]CR[md];W[ke]
(;B[id]CR[jc]C[This helps White since you have to go back and fix your defect at K17. So instead, fix it right away.]
;W[hc];B[jc];W[md];B[qj]C[Should I have played instead on the top to help the black grp there?

Yes, because never take a big point over an urgent point. You can tell if something is urgent if it is uncomfortable due to
1. short liberties
2. cutting defects
3. lacking base

Both the white and black stones are in a running battle; must continue thereabouts.]
;W[if]C[Now White will force you into a narrow area. Painful.]

;W[eg]SQ[qj]C[I am running under attack, not a good thing but don't know what to do otherwise

This is the big price for R10. R10 was a fundamental error. Always urgent before big points.]
;B[gj];W[fi];B[gi];W[ij];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[qe]C[What is the best way to respond to this?

Connection.];B[pe];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb]C[B59: is this the biggest area move? Instead of S18, how about trying B15 invasiion? What do you think, is an invasion possible on the left.

Remember the guidelines:

1. under 20 points area? Reduce it.
2. 20 or more points and open to center, invade.
3. 30 or more points, invade.];W[ra];B[rc];W[qh];B[qf]CR[ph]
C[B63: slow and small. Better at Q12 connection and seal white in. It builds power so you can play all out on the bottom and center.]
;W[ql];B[rn]C[B65: this look like it defends the black stones on the bottom? Do they need help?]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[rl];B[ph];W[qi];B[pi];W[rj];B[bo]C[I am interested in reducing the left side.

The left side is too large for only a reduction; it begs for an invasion.]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[bm];B[bd]C[I felt that I have to do something about the left side. Is this invasion well timed? Is it at the right point?

It might work; lets c...];W[cc]
(;B[cf]CR[df]C[I expect to live here, right?

Yes you should succeed or get something.

See Var];W[df];B[bc];W[bb];B[cd];W[db];B[bh]CR[cj]C[Is the top left grp alive?
B85: thin.
If you see life with this gote move, fine; otherwise you must find forcing moves. For example, C10 is a forcing attachment.]

B93 is heavy. White punishes you correctly. Maybe try C9 instead?]
