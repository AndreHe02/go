C[Bill: This is a game against the Smart Go computer.. I used to be about a 5 kyu but haven't played in years and I am trying to get back into Go.

catch22: Hi, I have been reviewing this game. It has been the first game I reviewed where one player was a computer. I have to say, I think White played quite a few strange moves, where it was difficult to see any logic. Even when someone is much weaker, you can usually see what their thinking is, even if it is flawed. This was not always the case here.

You definitely played better than the computer and deservedly won. Nevertheless (surprise, surprise) you did not play perfectly. To illustrate what is wrong with some of your moves, I have shown quite a few variations where White exploits these mistakes (in the game, that did not happen that often). Of course, I have also shown variations for Black that suggest better ways of playing.

I hope you'll find the comments useful. If you have not started doing so already, I suggest you'll find yourself some human opponents (for example online). I think it will help you improve more quickly if you play opponents where you can (mostly) see the logic behind their moves. :-)]
;B[pd];W[qp]V[0];B[dq];W[cd]V[0];B[co];W[oq]V[0];B[jq]C[Bill: Is this move okay or should I approach the white stone in the upper left corner.  If that is better,Why?

catch22: This move is fine. An extension like this in front of your shimari is rarely wrong. Approaching in the upper left corner is okay as well. However, there are multiple options there, and if it is not clear yet (to you, or due to the board position) which approach is best, it is better to stick with a move you know to be right. :-)]
;W[pg]V[-1.9];B[ec]SL[md]LB[md:A]C[Bill: I chose to attack this stone now after computers move #8 was that good or would it have been better to respond to #8 with something like A

catch22: First of all, an approach is not an attack. An approach is just intended to get a part of the territory/influence in the corner. You need a few more stones before you can call it an attack on the white stone.

Secondly, White's approach is a bit strange. It is more usual to approach at Q14 or R14. As it is, the white stone is a bit far away.

Thirdly, if you are going to respond, you should probably do so at either O16 or O17. Responding at N16 is a bit too far away. It gives White too much opportunity to mess around in the corner, e.g. by playing R17, Q17, Q18, R16 or S16.

Having said all that, I think it's okay to ignore White's approach and play an approach move yourself. With a stone on the 4-4 point it is usually okay to ignore an approach move (you will not be in too much difficultly if later there is a second approach move), and given that White's initial approach move was quite far away, it holds even more so.]
HO[1]V[-1.9]BM[1]
(;W[go]V[5.2];B[gq]C[catch22: White's move was a bit unusual. Responding as you did is good. You claim some territory, whereas the value of White's stone still remains to be seen.]
;W[lq]C[Bill: I was at a loss as to where to play here, went with a to press the attack on the upper corner but I don't know if that is any good?

catch22: Yes, I think that the top left is now the most important part of the board. Whoever plays here first, gets an advantage there.]
V[5.4];B[ee]C[Bill: Move 12 seemed small for white....

catch22: Indeed.]BM[1];W[dc]V[-6.3];B[jd]C[Bill: My move 15 is not Joseki so is it okay ... I was looking at the whole board perspective

catch22: I am not entirely happy about it. See the variation for White's next move to see why.]

C[catch22: This is a bit of a strange move.]V[-6.1]
(;B[if]TR[pg]C[Bill: Was 21 okay? Not sure if this was the right move to make to attack 20.

catch22: No, this is not good. First of all, this move is not doing much useful besides attacking. Should White get away, its purpose is unclear. It is not making any territory, and neither useful influence (the marked white stone limits what Black can do with any influence). You generally should not attack to kill or capture. If that fails, you may end up with nothing. It is better to attack in such a way that you gain something while doing so, even if the target eventually gets away.

Secondly, you are weakening your stones at the top left. They are not as weak as the White stone. However, you still have to be a bit careful.

See the variations for better ways of playing.]BM[1]
(;W[fp]C[Bill: This seems kind of weak... should I respond?  I just thought there were bigger points to make elsewhere on the board

catch22: This is a strange move by White. Nevertheless, you should respond, as doing so helps you. As it is (also before White's last move), there is still a weakness in your position at H2. There's aji there that White can exploit. If you now respond at G3, that aji will be gone. So you gain by responding, whereas it is not clear what White gained by playing F4. 

Furthermore, if White separates you into two groups by continuing at F3, you will be split into two. Much of your territory will be destroyed. Playing at G3 also avoids that.]
V[-12.1];B[qj]C[catch22: Best to simply play F3. With two unsettled positions on the board already (at the top left and bottom left), it is a bit premature to play here.]
;W[jc]V[-10.1];B[kc];W[ql]V[-8.7];B[oj];W[ng]V[-14.3];B[mj]
TR[ng][pg]C[Bill: I like the way things have gone so far

catch22: Yes, White has been jumping around the board a bit too much and left too many weak stones lying around. He now seems committed to save the marked ones, but doing so will harm the others.]
;W[kb]TR[mj][ng]C[Bill: I am at a loss as to what white is doing and hence not sure how to respond?

catch22: White's play is a bit inconsistent. It now looks as if White wants to rescue his stones at the top (or sacrifice these, and in exchange invade Black's territory at the top right). However, doing so will harm the two white stones at the left. So if White was going to play here, he should not have exchanged the marked stones.

See variation for the next move for a suggested response.]V[-28.2]

V[-22.6];B[ff];W[hc]TR[jc][jb][kb]C[catch22: Bad. Unless White can/wants to rescue these stones right now, he should not make this exchange, as it hurts the three marked stones.]
V[-25.6];B[ib];W[kd]C[catch22: Also bad. It unnecessarily sacrifices three stones, and it's not clear what White gets in return.]

(;B[qn]TR[kd][ld][md][nd][ng][pg]C[Bill: Was this the right time to spring the attack at 45?  I could have responded to 44 in the corner but might have lost the chance at attacking here at 45?

catch22: No, this was not the right time. You should have simply responded at the top (see variation). This attack/invasion is not urgent because White has to look after his marked stones first, before he can soldify his territory at the bottom right.]
BM[1]
(;W[ob]C[Bill: Ouch?! Now I am a little worried

catch22: No need to worry. White is actually letting you of the hook. If White had played P17 this would be more difficult to handle (see variation).]
V[-21.1];B[oc];W[pc]C[Bill: I got lost here a bit and feel like I missed a chance to gain much more

catch22: Indeed, you could have handled this better.]V[-12.8]

(;B[pb]C[catch22: This is not good. Unless you follow this up (e.g. by playing O18 next, still not a good move by the way), you should refrain from playing moves like this. In the game White captures this stone, which gives White eye shape. You do not get anything in exchange for this "sacrifice". So, you are effectively giving White a free move.]
;W[qc]V[-13.8];B[od];W[qb]V[-25.4];B[qd]TR[kc][jc][jb][kb][lc]
[mc][nc][oc][od][pd]C[catch22: White lives in the corner, and takes away Black's territory here. Not a good result for Black. 

Note that Black does not have to worry about the safety of his marked stones. He can capture the three white stones at anytime. There is nothing White can do to rescue these.]

;W[pa]V[1.2];B[ke]TR[jc][jb][kb][mj][oj][qj]C[Bill: I don't think 61 was the right move but I wanted to solidify the large moyo I'm building.

catch22: This move is slow. Capturing these four stones is worth about eight points at best. Even if you do not play here, it remains to be seen if White can rescue these stones.

Capturing cutting stones is sometimes very big, because it can be strategically important (giving you one strong group instead of two weak ones). This, however, is not the case here. Black can still capture the three marked white stones at anytime, so the two black stones are already connected.

I would be better to play Q7. This goes a long way towards capturing the White stone there, which strengthens the three marked black stone, which in turn also soldifies your moyo.]

V[-1.1];B[ck]C[Bill: Don't know about this move

catch22: It's not good. Given the big weakness at C4, you should have played there instead. That not only gives you solid territory in the corner, but also reduces the amount of potential territory White can make at the left.]
BM[1];W[cp]V[8.4];B[bq];W[rj]C[catch22: White should have followed through with B4.]
V[-8.3];B[ri];W[oh]C[catch22: Another strange move.]V[5.1];B[jj]
C[Bill: How is this move to prevent white from running?

catch22: Definitely the right idea. The other moves that spring to my mind are K11, L10 and L11. It is difficult to say which is best.]
BM[1];W[lf]V[3.3];B[le];W[cj]V[-3.8];B[dm]C[catch22: It is more important to connect to the corner by playing B4. If White plays there instead, the black stones will be in trouble. Even if they can run away into the center, doing so will not gain Black anything.]

(;W[bk]C[catch22: Strange. After playing the last couple of moves, White should follow through by playing M7.]
V[10.5];B[cl]TR[ck]C[catch22: The marked black stone is not important. Locally it is better for Black to connect at B4. Alternatively, Black could leave these stones to fend after themselves (and in the worst case, simply sacrifice them), and play at M8, or thereabouts, which is much bigger.]

V[-21.6];B[jk];W[nj]V[-21.3];B[ni];W[rp]V[26.9];B[nk]C[Bill: This move seemed not so strong

catch22: It is not too bad. If you do not play here, White could play here in sente (if you then don't play P11 in response, White can play there). Furthermore, playing here is pretty much sente for you as well.]
BM[1];W[ol]V[4.3];B[lk]TR[kl][ll][mk]C[catch22: This is unnecessary. As the three marked stones are short of liberties, there is nothing White can do with these stones anyway. By playing here now you give away a ko threat, and also the option to play at N7 in sente instead (this does not yet look too useful, but you never know).]
;W[ml]V[0.8];B[pm];W[mo]V[-6.9];B[bp]C[catch22: Good. This is a good moment to tenuki. As you can play either K6 or Q8 you do not have to worry about your stones at the right.]
