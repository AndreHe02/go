C[rarellano:

Hi reviewer.

This is a game that i feel confortable playing it, but still lost by 16.5 points. I had some oportunities to attack and drive my opponent but finally i didn't kill and got  no profit. I misread one invasion on the corner, but I don't think that was so huge to lose the game.  Maybe some moves are conceptually wrong.

Thanks in advance for the review.

Hi Jon. My name is Paul and I will be reviewing the game.
I'm 1K on KGS.

(;W[bh]LB[ch:A]C[This is a mistake in direction as well as technique.

If white wants to fight on the side he should attach at A instead of diving onto the second line.
His prospects here are very limited as he can't expect to get much on the left side.

The question for B now is how to proceed.]
(;B[ce];W[df]LB[fd:A]C[This is a "thank you" move. The W stones are now stronger than before and your pincer stone is separated and alone.

If I were B and really wanted to play  at A I would do it without this last exchange.]
;B[fd];W[ff]TR[cn]C[W has poked out nicely but his group still has a lot to be desired shape-wise.

The focus now turns to handling the marked B stone.]
(;B[bp]LB[qj:A]C[Good focus. You clearly understand the importance of this area and didn't go off looking for big points like A.

But... the second line move seems to mimic W's weak move above. You can do better.]
;W[en];B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[qn]C[A big point to be sure but I think completing the bottom left corner is more urgent.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[nq];B[pj];W[qh];B[qf];W[oh];B[rj];W[nc]
(;B[kc]LB[lc:A]C[I would tend to think first of going all the way to A.]
;W[hc]LB[md:A][nd:B]C[This looks like an overplay to me.

The top is clearly B's sphere of influence and W is spreading himself thin. A formula for trouble.

In this position W has 4 groups on the upper side! Way too many to manage.
Separating W's stones would be the first thing I would strive for by plaing at A or B.]
(;B[oc];W[nd]LB[qc:A]SQ[nc][oc][pd]C[A note here on shape.

In the shape created by the four marked stones W's stones have better shape. This shape is seen all over in Go and is well worth understanding. The idea is that the marked black stones have a weakness at A where as the W stones don't have the same problem.

In some situations B is willing to accept that small defect in order to keep W's stones from settling too easily but here the corner is still not without aji and B's stone on top is weakened.

In fighting like this (i.e. in your own sphere of influence) it is usually better to avoid any move that strengthens your opponent.]
;B[gc];W[hd]C[This strengthens W on the outside also.

Additionally B's shape evokes the proverb Beware The Clumsy Double Contact:

(;B[of]LB[ke:A]C[rarellano: slow ?

This is correct locally. The two space jump is not so good as it will require you to return and add another stone later.
I like playing at A.];W[me];B[ke]C[GOOD. W's move is way too timid.]
;W[mg];B[kg]C[YES YES, it is important to strengthen your group and get out.]
;W[mi]C[In this position I don't think you can make a lot on the top side as your three stone group is weaker than the surrounding W stones in this area.

My eye is drawn to the bottom which is waiting for a W move to consolidate a lot of territory.]
