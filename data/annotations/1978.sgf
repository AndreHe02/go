C[Go friends,

My name is Peter Hoehe. I am 2k in Germany. I enjoyed this game very much. It was a calm and collected game. It seems that you should both look for sente moves in the endgame. And you both should not try to make much territory in the center, it is very difficult.

enjoy the upcoming games.];B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[qn];W[jp]
;B[gq];W[op];B[oq]C[R: Better at Q4. B takes territory and W must answer.]
;W[np]C[R: Better at O3. W want to have a base.];B[nq];W[mp]
;B[pp]C[R: Good.];W[mq];B[iq]C[R: Better to tenuki here. If W wants to live now, he has to add a move, which is very small. So B can consider to make a big move instead of J3.]
;W[po]C[R: Too early. Better to jump immediately to P7 or O7. B gets secure territory this way.]
;B[qo];W[pn];B[pm]C[R: Good.];W[om]
(;B[on]C[R: This is only good if you are going to cut and fight. see var.]
;W[oo];B[ol];W[nm];B[ql]C[R: Good. B can consider playing first O8 and then R8]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[nk];B[jq]C[R: Why not take territory with P10? B would have 30 points secure territory AND influence. Now W can play P10 himself.]
;W[kq];B[jd]C[R: If B wants to have a stable group, it is more easy to play there on the 3rd line. With the 2 point extension the group on the 3rd line is nearly alive.]
;W[mc];B[gd];W[cg];B[cm]C[R: This lets san-san open to an invasion. Better to play C4 or C5.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo]
(;B[cn]C[R: Why not B6? The 3 stones are connected, and W must struggle to live. see var.]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[gm]C[R: This leaves ayi for an endgame move at F2.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[dc]C[R: Good.];B[dj];W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[gi]
C[R: It is very difficult to gain territory in the center. A proverb states: There is no territory in the center. So B should consider to invade the left side instead of these moves. Or take a big move on the right side.]
;W[oj]C[R: Good.];B[pk]C[R: That is not necessary. It is better to play Q10. This gives more territory.]
;W[pj];B[qj];W[nj]C[R: Also not necessary. Consider a W stone at R11. The top right looks very white then. The possible cut at O10 seems not so problematic as the center group is alive.]
;B[qh]C[R; Good.];W[kc]C[R: Small.]
(;B[jc]C[R: I think this is too small. The 2 B stones are nearly connected to the center, so they will not die. R17 is much bigger. Invading there would be good, because the resulting W wall has no target to attack. see var.]
;W[kd];B[fc]C[R: Very small, and this does not attack W.];W[qd]
C[R: Good. Now it is very difficult for B.];B[rf];W[je];B[ie]
;W[if];B[jf];W[ke];B[jb];W[kb];B[hf];W[ig];B[hd];W[jg];B[pf]
;W[kf];B[ip];W[jo];B[io];W[jn];B[in]C[R: Jumping to J7 would be faster.]
;W[jm];B[oh];W[ck];B[cl];W[eh];B[fi];W[bk]C[R: Small.];B[an]
;W[ap];B[im];W[il];B[hl];W[ik];B[mh];W[li];B[lh];W[kh];B[mi]
;W[mj]
(;B[me]C[R: This is not the biggest move on the board. I think it's about 4 points in gote. Let's pick up some possibilities. see var.]

(;W[ne]C[R: W could consider some bigger moves. see var.];B[nf]
;W[nd];B[lf];W[rd]C[R: S15 is a little better. S16 is purely defensive. S15 threatens T14. So B may answer there and W gets sente.]
;B[pi];W[fe];B[ce]C[R: An overplay. Overplay tend to make the enemy stronger. One should work out a possible sequence before invading so deep.]

;W[ef];B[cb];W[db];B[bb];W[cc];B[ed];W[dg];B[ec];W[cf];B[eb]
;W[da];B[ea];W[be]C[R: Not necessary now. If B connects there, W can play atari at B14. So the 8 stones above are safe.]
;B[ka]C[R: Good, this is sente.];W[la];B[ja];W[lb];B[gf];W[hk]
;B[gk];W[kr];B[jr];W[mr];B[nr];W[es]C[R: F2 is much bigger. Note that B cannot block at E1 then.]
;B[fr];W[ds];B[ki];W[lj];B[jh];W[kg];B[ii]C[R: Nice sequence.]
;W[kj];B[ji];W[hj];B[hi];W[gj];B[fj];W[jj];B[fg];W[re];B[qe]
C[R: Better S15 or R13.];W[pe]C[R: First T14 because B cannot block at T13.]

This seems a little more for B. It could be predicted, that the points can be equally divided in the center.]
