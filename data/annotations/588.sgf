;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[I'm playing white.   I've played hundreds of games against
TurboGo and ManyFaces, but relatively few against humans.  So in some areas
I'm somewhat skilled, while in others there are large gaps in
my knowledge.

  I'm very hesitant to make large jumps, or to invade, and I don't know how
to handle either side of a pincer.  I'd be very interested in hearing about
ways I could improve my skills in these areas, via books, reviewing
specific game collections, &c.

Go books I've studied:

1) Go for Beginners (Iwamoto)
2) In the Beginning (Ishigure - about fuseki)
3) Get Strong at Joseki (Bozulich)

I'm still working on the Bozulich book.  I'm not sure Joseki is the correct
"next step". Should I be working on Life and Death
instead?];B[de];W[cd];B[ce];W[fd]C[This I felt very comfortable with.  It's
just like what ManyFaces would do.



b's aim would be theE17 point, maybe not right away...];B[dh]
C[usual extension is one more empty row than number of stones.  Since
it's a 2-stone wall, normal would therefore be D11 or C11.]
;W[gq];B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[jq]C[
why w K3 this early instead of a more global point such as R10 or Q10
?];B[pj]C[I have this feeling -I- should have gone there, but somehow these
small extensions feel more natural.];W[ic];B[kc];W[or];B[nq]
;W[mr]C[
I like w O2 better than N2; it threatens w N3, but if b plays N3 after w
O2, then w can do R3];B[nr];W[qq]C[I think W R3 right away better than doing N2
first];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro];W[sq];B[qo];W[pq]C[
what if b went Q3 instead of R5 ?];B[oq];W[pr];B[rr];W[ns]C[This didn't go
the way I'd hoped.  Isn't it supposed to be always possible to make life on
a 4-4 invasion like this, without escaping to the side?];B[mq]
;W[lr];B[lq];W[kr]C[
how about w L3 instead of L2 ?];B[rq]C[this is big for B, hence the
suggestion of w O2 before];W[ko]C[This feels like a good
move.];B[mn];W[fo]C[hmmm, if b L7, it works with L17 to sketch out large
moyo, so maybe w should L7 himself instead of F5.];B[ep];W[eq]
C[
what about w E5 instead ?];B[do];W[cq];B[fp];W[fq];B[bo];W[gp]
;B[eo];W[gm]TR[fo]C[This was too far? The
marked stone was left vulnerable.];B[ek];W[km];B[ke];W[hj]C[w H10 doesn't
look so large.    It neither grows w much or shrinks b much.   For example,
if b responded at L10, b grows while threatening to take away whatever
extra H10 threatened to give to w.

In contrast, if b played R16, it prevents w from invading at R17, so R17,
although maybe not the best move for w, looks bigger than H10.]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[go];W[ho];B[cp];W[dq];B[ec]
(;W[eb]C[I suppose I should have gone at the mark, instead?


seems to timid for w, who has lots of stones in this area.  if E18 is best
w can do, even after fortifying with J17, then F16 was inadequate and
should have been at F17.  I think e E16 instead of E18 makes better use of
W stones.];B[ed];W[fc];B[fe];W[kj]C[

hmmm, has w left himself open to b F18, which threatens to both atari at
D18 and to move out to G18 ?];B[pf];W[ml];B[om];W[nj]C[
Again, given that w can still invade at R17, and that b Q17 would prevent
it, is w O10 really very big ?];B[pc];W[hg]C[maybe w B16 would be bigger than H13 ?  w h13 makes b L13
attractive, since L13 is the point that grows b and shrinks w.  Maybe w L13
better than w H13, since L13 *threatens w H13 and also threatens followup
at w O13.];B[he];W[kg];B[hc];W[gb];B[hb];W[dd];B[ee];W[ng];B[ne]
;W[ph]C[maybe w Q11
is better.];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh]C[Is there any way I could have threatened the
middle right, without getting cut off?



w giving b too much here.
instead of w O11, maybe w R10.  Learn to use contact plays when defending
yourself in enemy territory.];W[nh];B[og];W[mf];B[me];W[lf]
C[When I played this, I thought it was sente.
 Obviously not.];B[jf];W[jg];B[if];W[ig]C[And yet, I just realized, that I
reacted to it as tho it were sente here.

I suppose I should have been pushing into the left, or solidifying the
upper left?];B[lm];W[ll];B[kn];W[jn];B[ln];W[jl]C[
instead of this wK8, how about w sentes at H19, and B16 then A15 then w P9.
