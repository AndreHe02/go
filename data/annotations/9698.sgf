;W[qj];B[ol]C[Seems promising for black, white's upper right is a little awkward and is not projecting influence in the way that white intended.]

(;B[qe]C[spiritburd [1d\]: Probably not the best attack he could counter with r17 making my group weak, but seemed better then r17 directly.

This is horrible, it's as though you had a stone here, he played a shoulder hit with Q14, and you tenuki'd (which you would obviously never do).]

(;W[pe]C[spiritburd [1d\]: strange move the wall seemed bad to me with his influence being directed at f15 developing]

(;B[qf]C[spiritburd [1d\]: should have played other direction I think looking back.]

(;B[oc]C[spiritburd [1d\]: He should ignore this and push of course.

This is the worst move of the game (so far). Never, ever, ever peep like this. It does nothing for you and helps white become much stronger. Just about the only good thing about this is that at least it's sente so you can try to repair the damage by playing elsewhere.

White should just capture as in game. It's so good for white.]

(;W[pc];B[kc];W[ob]C[Insanely slow, WTF. W]
(;B[jp]C[spiritburd [1d\]: was debaing l15 to fix my weakness but c6 is just to much to let him have so would pincer if he plays there I assume.

(;W[ic]
(;B[ke]C[spiritburd [1d\]: Looking back I think two point jump is better here get ahead of white maybe?

The best answer is to defend against this invasion. This is better than the 2 space however since you want to put some pressure back on white, and the 2 space does not do that.]
;W[ie];B[kg];W[ig];B[ki]TR[ob][pc][pd][pe][pf][pg][qg]C[This isn't really a very good result for white. As long as you can make sure that white doesn't get a splitting attack going on your center white isn't using his thickness at all effectively.]

I will point out that this stone was bad shape back when you played it, and you've had to invest three seperate moves I think to try to deal with the problems it created. Playing good shape the first time is worthwhile, you've paid and paid for an attempt to cut corners.]
