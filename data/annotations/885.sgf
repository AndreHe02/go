(;B[cf]C[Normally on C16. This Variation is too good for White.]
;W[cd]
(;B[di]C[This is too close. C10 is normal.];W[ic]C[The direction is OK. But it should be further to the right.
An alternative is a move around R6 to keep the balance.];B[qf]
C[Not a good point.

Look into Joseki books for ways to attack 3-4 stones.];W[nq]
C[When should i attack the left side?

That is not urgent. Play constructive.
You could defend the upper right first.];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[oq]
;B[pq];W[kq]C[Too close.];B[gq]C[OK.];W[cn]C[Looks good, because of the mistake with D11.]
;B[co];W[dn]
(;B[ep]C[bad play for black,
right? should he have moved to c8 maybe?

The move does not look good, because it is too tight. I am unsure about a good and save alternative. See the variations.]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[dj];B[ej];W[pn]C[White should continue on the right side, or White will be in trouble.]

(;B[pl]C[Looks like a possible answer.  A good alternative is Q5.]

(;W[po]C[bad move for white, right? suggestions for a
better one? perhaps i should have pushed at p4 first?

Pushing at P4 does not help much. See variation.];B[op]C[An empty triangle. I do not see a way to avoid this. W is in trouble.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[rn];B[qm]
(;W[rq]C[s5 instead?

S5 does not help. If anything, then S4.

Running into the center is the only way.];B[rp];W[qp];B[qq]
;W[qo];B[rr];W[rl];B[rm];W[sm];B[rk];W[nm]C[Why not jump?];B[mo]
;W[nl]C[Oh, this looses too much on the lower side.]
(;B[ok]C[Empty triangle. Bad move!];W[nk]
(;B[qk]C[Another bad move. Not necessary.];W[pe]C[hmmm.  53 seems like a bad move for me.  suggestions
for a better way to put pressure on black & also secure terrirotry? or
is there a better move altogether?

The last move was White 54. Seems we have a different count.

However, you should use the opportunity to save your lower side.]
;B[pf]C[Ok.];W[oe];B[oh]C[Bad move. Locally and globally. Too small.]
;W[me]C[OK.];B[nj]C[Too small and just helping White.];W[mj]
;B[ni]
(;W[mi]C[I'd prefer going to the left];B[mh];W[ki];B[kh];W[ke]
C[Not urgent. The lower side is still in danger!];B[kg]C[Again, the main focus is not here.]
;W[lp];B[lo]C[Not a good way to attack.];W[ko];B[kn];W[jo];B[jn]

;B[kk];W[kj];B[mm]
(;W[ml]C[Making it too easy for Black.];B[nn];W[li]C[i had no business saving the middle there. i should have lost it.  black
misplayed.  suggestions for a better approach to save the white group on
the white than what i did there?

Now, you must save them immediately, because Black is now strong in the middle.]
;B[ho]C[Unclear. Serves no purpose.]
(;W[io]C[Should be on J3, if at all necessary.];B[hn];W[bj]
C[Finally, White is doing something for this group.];B[bi]C[Too small.]

;W[fg];B[eg];W[ff];B[iq];W[jr];B[jp];W[kp]C[Not necessary.]
;B[ir];W[lr]C[was this necessary?

Of course.];B[gl]C[Another unclear move. What is this good for?]
;W[gk]C[Too small.];B[hj];W[hk];B[ik];W[il];B[jl];W[hm]C[hmmm.  a better move
than this? maybe j7?

A better move is a move somewhere else. All these moves are smaller than anything on the top corners.]
;B[im];W[hl];B[gm];W[in]C[Especially this is way too small.]
;B[gn];W[ip];B[hp];W[if]C[there must have been a much bigger move somewhere than this?

Yes B16 or S15. Enlarging the corners is usually big.];B[ii]
;W[og]C[You did consider this carefully?];B[of];W[ng];B[nf]
;W[mg];B[mf]C[Black should invest a lot of time, before playing such a move.
Very dangerous!!!];W[pg];B[lf];W[nh];B[lh];W[oj]C[Oh!];B[ph]

(;W[oi];B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[ne]C[If you thought this is necessary, you are right to play here.]
;B[je];W[kf]C[No! Leaves to much chances for Black (Bad Aji).]
;B[jf];W[ni]C[What is this good for?];B[lg];W[le];B[jd]C[Black has gained a lot due to the mistake at L14.]
;W[ie]C[You need to defend you territory now, instead of this one stone.]
;B[id]
(;W[qe]C[Not good.];B[re];W[rd]C[Now you have to play this in Gote. Very bad.]

(;B[pi]C[Very bad! Gives opportunties to White.];W[pj]

S11, and everything is save.];W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[rf];W[ji]

Black should try to live with the four stones immediately.]

it somehow
