C[Brian: Well this game was intresting, I'd appreciate a review of the fight in the middle, which I won totally by luck, but I think it would be a good game to review. Thank you, Brian Yee.

FM: natural splitting. Maybye playing on the fourth line would be a bit better to make it easier to go to the centre]
;W[ql]C[FM: also natural move.]
(;B[ph]LB[rh:A]TR[qj]C[FM: this makes the marked stone standing a bit strange and white is instantly aiming at the A point]
;W[of];B[nd];W[mf];B[ck]LB[ld:B][bn:A]C[FM: strange move. As the lower left corner is dead, this stone has only minimal attacking power even if black gets the A sente move and can be easily pincered. This move should absolutely be tenukied by white, for example by playing at B.]
;W[bn]TR[ck]C[FM: This makes the marked exchange good kikashi for black]
;B[pl]LB[rh:B][ok:A]C[FM: interesting move. Black is afraid of white getting both A and B, which would hurt his shape, but also strenghtens white a lot.]

(;B[ri]LB[qh:A]C[FM: when playing in this area, A is better, hurting the white shape and making some cutting aji. Being thicker is more important than getting one eye.]

;B[lc];W[se]C[FM: white last seven moves were 12k moves. Probably a matter of psychology, when the winning player, after a successful beginning, tries to end the game too quickly and underestimates his opponent, resulting in getting such a terrible outcome as in this area.]

[mk:A][nm:B]C[FM: black gets an optional life in the A-B-C combination and gets our of the fight quite well]
;W[ci];B[cc]LB[ib:C][gd:A][id:B]C[FM: A was the proper invasion I think. After A, black can easily make good shape by playing B and C in sente, while destroying the eye space of the two white stones]

;B[cd];W[de]
(;B[db];W[eb];B[cb]
(;W[fc]C[FM: white is missing a big opportunity];B[cf]C[FM: black gets a fantastic position out of playing sansan into the area where white already had four stones around. White is losing points again]

;B[bg]
(;W[df];B[cg];W[dg]LB[ch:A][dh:B][bi:C]TR[bf][bg]C[FM: the A-B-C aji is too painful for white. The marked exchange was bad for white]

;B[ig]C[FM: fighting spirit];W[kf];B[jg];W[kg];B[hf]LB[jb:C]
[ie:B][ii:A]C[FM: discutable. Better to play A directly. By playing atari like this, black forces white to play B, which protects the big endgame point of C. Also, if after black A white continues attacking, black can play B himself when he gets a chance]

(;W[cj];B[jb]C[FM: this move is too optimistic]
(;W[ib]C[FM: big loss];B[kb];W[hc]
(;B[mm];W[mn];B[mk];W[nm];B[ml];W[lo];B[fr]TR[db][sd][qi]C[FM: black got all the four most important endgame moves. The game is over now.

It was won by psychology, luck and nice trying - after what happened on the bottom, white started playing quite careless and lost every fight after black splitted his groups on the right side. You erased his lead little by little everywhere, making no really big mistakes after losing the lower left corner. The most painful black mistakes were the few too quickly played stones like those I have markered, which could be much improved quite easily just by looking a bit more detailed on the position. Except of those, I think it was a nice game from your side.


Wish you many enjoyed games and I hope you liked my comments.
