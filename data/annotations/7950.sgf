C[Marvin; I'm reviewing this game.

I'm 6k on KGS. And basically I'm not very good. So please accept my attempt to teach you.

ps; they greeted each other etc. but I deleted all conversation from the file. So hopefull everything that's to be read is by my hand.]

;B[qi]C[Marvin; black is not safe yet in the top left. Also 13 could be played higher I think.]

[rk][sk][ll][ol][pl][ql][sl][rm][pn][qn][sn][ro][qp]C[Marvin; I don't know who I did the review for, but I'm assuming black. Since that's the weaker player and has most to gain from this. 

Black needs to look a lot more at life & death situations.

But most importantly he needs to look more at what white is doing. It's easy to see your own plans, but you need to be aware of what white is planning. So when he's creating a wall in the center. Your first instinct will be to protect your right, but you need to see how much weakness it creates on the left (in this case) as well. 

In this case; Weakness = inability to create space for yourself.

I hope it helped.

I'm sorry if I made a lot mistakes. I'm still learning as well.]
