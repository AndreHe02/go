C[forfun (hereafter ff) - This is an interesting game.  Both sides are willing to fight it out when necessary.  On the other hand both sides could improve their game by working to understand the big picture better in order to get more benefit out of their fighting spirit.  In Black's case I thought that there were a couple of times when a better understanding of the strategic balance of the game would have led to quite different choice of plays.]
;B[qd];W[ec];B[cp];W[pp];B[cd];W[de]C[ff - This is an unusual choice when the upper right corner is Black.  Professional play tends to be at E3 instead.  Of course the logic of D15 is that the stone at C4 is low in relation to the left side.  Therefore if White can push Black down in the upper left as well, Black's overall position will be unsatisfactory.  However, the pushing joseki that starts with D15 gives Black secure territory.  When Black has a solid stone in the upper right, White is in danger of not obtaining sufficient compensation for Black's profit on the left.]
;B[dd]C[ff - The push and cut is unusual when there are no supporting stones nearby - for example a Black pincer stone on the top side.  Black tries too hard here?]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[ce]LB[ce:10][df:A]C[The joseki given in Ishida/Kogo is W A, but nobody plays this.
The answer W 10 seems to be better than the joseki.
How to continue without being enclosed in the corner?

ff - If Black is not ready to be enclosed in the corner, the answer is simple - do not push and cut with D16 and E15 :-)  The fundametal situation here is that one set of Black stones will be confined while the other (the lone cutting stone for now) will be floating in the center.  The White play at A (D14) is the most common continuation here but C15 is also used in professional play.  It is more severe on the Black corner stones but perhaps less so on the center stone(s).  Generally speaking Ishida/Kogo is not a reliable indicator of what lines are available to your opponent.  It is already 30 years old and did not cover the less common joseki very completely to begin with.]
;B[be]
(;W[bf];B[bd]
(;W[cf]C[ff - usually this stone is played at D13.  C14 here is more severe toward the corner but puts less pressure on the center.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[bb]C[It is annoying how many sente moves White got for very few points although White deviated from the joseki.

ff - Normal here is D17 afterwhich the corner is alive.  The play at B18 leaves the 3-stone White pillar with one more liberty.  Black may come to regret this when the cutting stone is set in motion.]
;W[ic]C[ff - Note that this is somewhat odd.  A low extension does not put pressure on the stone at E15.  Again because it is low, there is no good follow up on the top side, which means that White will have difficulty getting full usage out of the White wall in the upper left.]
;B[cj]C[ff - This looks like the right direction after White has played at J17.  However, this stone should have been played on the fourth line at D10.  The basic relationship between the stone at C10 (third line) and the cutting stone at E15 (fifth line) is not correct.  White is able to easily intercept on the fourth line.]
;W[dh]C[ff - This hits the sweet spot to separate the Black stones.  However, White could also have waited until Black tries to put the E15 stone in motion (for example with a play at E14) before making this play.  Although the relationship is good the play at D12 is not yet urgent and it is not big by itself.]

(;B[ep]C[ff - This stone is played at a normal "large point".  In this particular situation, however, I think that Black could have done better with a play at E10 (see the variation).]
;W[ej]C[ff - This is a big play that finally makes some sense out of White's upper left.]

(;B[pj]C[Is p16 better?

ff - The right side is not the point right now.  The issue is what will White make out of the wall in the upper left.  I would not choose P16 in any case.  A high move is interesting since White would not like to play a second low move off of J17.  However, I would prefer O16 to P16.  See the variations.]
;W[od];B[qn];W[np];B[md]C[Is the pincer still possible? If not, how can I forestall a big white moyo on top?

ff - See the variations.  White certainly had more resources here than the game showed.  Given the number of Black stone on the right side, the pincer seems possible.  However, with the White strength on the left, it is not clear that White is under a lot of pressure.]

(;W[qc]C[ff - It is rather naive to expect Black to passively answer at S17 :-)]
;B[pd]C[ff - Good choice by Black.]
(;W[oe]C[Mistake of opponent.

ff - I think the mistake was really R17.  Now White struggles with how to find a reasonable line of play that makes use of the left side walls.]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[mf];W[og];B[mh];W[ob];B[qf];W[oi]
(;B[ie]C[ff - Black could also consider playing this at N18 to continue attacking the White pillar on the right.  However, this play wipes out all of White's moyo and firmly puts Black in control of the game.  It is a good, calm choice.  Basically White's plan in approaching the upper right at P16 has not worked.]
;W[lc]
(;B[mc]C[ff - This exchange of N17 and M16 by Black for N18 and L17 for White is very bad for Black.  This greatly reduces the aji of plays like the attachment at H17 and the attachment at K17 is gone completely.  The resulting shape for Black's stones "looks" nice and solid but this is thinking purely defensively.  With the cutting stone at E15 waiting, Black should be thinking about the potential to split the top side in half.  Instead Black forces White to solidify the connection.]
;W[mb];B[ld];W[kc];B[ig];W[qh];B[qb]LB[qb:47][qh:46]C[I guessed 46 and 47 to be miai.

ff - In terms of life for the upper right Black stones they are miai.  However, R12 undercuts the stones on the lower right, putting them at risk.  If Black had connected the right side stones by playing R12 instead of N17, etc. in the center, White would have no counterplay on the right side.]
;W[gq]C[ff - Having played R12, it is strange that White turns to G3 instead of attacking the two Black stones on the right.]
;B[iq];W[go];B[lq]C[ff - Black has gotten lucky here I think.  The balance of Black versus White stones in the lower right has gone up.  Black is still subject to attack here but should be able to handle it now.  Meanwhile White has created a weak group on the bottom side that has very little potential for making territory.]
;W[nn]C[ff - White invites Black to reinforce the right side :-)]
;B[rj]C[ff - Black accepts the invitation.  This has to be considered a poor exchange for White.]
;W[ql]C[ff - This timing is wrong.  It is no longer so easy to attack these stones profitably.]

(;B[pl]C[Is there a better answer for Black now?

ff - See the variations.  Basically though Black has resources here and should be able to handle the situation.]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[pm];B[qm];W[pk]C[B has three weak groups, but a plan to sacrifice one, thereby securing the two others.

ff - White has not separated Black into three groups.  Black is still connected underneath.  See the variation.]

(;B[rh]C[ff - Assuming that Black is separated :-), this play saves the wrong group.  The three-stone pillar is small.  After R18 in the upper right, Black is absolutely alive there.  Strengthening the upper right with S12 is uninteresting.  White ends up capturing three other Black stones on a much larger scale.  See the variations.]
;W[rk];B[pr]C[ff - Basically this stone looks too deep into the corner.  White cooperated in the game but the question is what would have happened if White had resisted strongly.  See the variations.]

(;W[qq]C[W does what B wants, he takes many points, but will be attacked on the lower left.

ff - In the game Black does not demonstrate that the attack on the lower left White stones is worth giving White such a large territory here.]
;B[oq];W[qr]C[ff - This looks very small.  Black is lucky that White did not take sente to play on the left.]
;B[dm];W[er];B[dq];W[dr]C[ff - Since White can not make eyes here, sliding and pushing like this only help Black solidify the lower left.]
;B[cr];W[ck];B[cl];W[dk]C[ff - If White can not descend at B9 and then turn at B10, the original attachment at C9 seems pretty pointless.]
;B[io];W[hr];B[ir];W[gm];B[ol]C[additional sacrifice stone ...]
;W[ok];B[nk]C[... to get this one.

ff - It is not at all clear that this exchange has any value for Black.  Later White plays P10 which has very bad aji on the right side black stones.]
;W[om];B[bk]
(;W[bi]C[ff - Another aji-keshi play.  This exchange makes it possible for Black to play E11 later and weakens the connection between White's lower left and upper left.]
;B[bj];W[oj]C[ff - A very big play made possible by Black's earlier P8 - O9 plays.  See variation on next White move.]
;B[fe]LB[ei:A]C[aims at A

ff - At this point Black aims at a weak point that White fails to recognize.  However, I don't think that Black is ahead.  Black has been outplayed on the right side.  Black made submissive plays at R18 and S12.  Black did not gain much from attacking the weak White stones on the lower left.]
