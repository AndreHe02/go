RE[B+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

;B[pd]C[Dear reviewer:
Thank's for your time in this review.
I played black and I win because my opponent did a very big mistake at endgame.
In the opening I'm feel winner but I did some mistakes and the game turn very close. Other mistakes and the game turn white and then white did the big mistake and resigned.
Thank's.

Hello,

The biggest issue I saw with black was the first corner fight. Also, general rule is to make sure your groups are safe before playing anything else. If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.

Have fun,

;B[op]TR[pl][ip]C[Comment: Splitting white's stones is correct. The idea is to let white have small profit in either side or in the corner and then build thickness using either of your marked stones.]

;W[jm];B[jn]LB[kq:A]C[Other waste mov.   Comment: This is good cut. White has to play A to live, his group has no route to the center and his stones are separated.]
;W[kq];B[fc]LB[hl:A]C[Comment: Correct. A would also be good move here. It gives your group access to the center and also puts pressure on white stones.]

;W[di];B[nc]LB[qf:A][qi:B][dl:D][hl:C]TR[qn][po][qo][pp][rp]
[qq][rq]C[Comment: I prefer A here. Perhaps black has more area potential with A and it forces white to invade upper side with no supporting stones.  Now white could play B and get support from his marked group . Anyway this is correct idea since you get huge moyo.  As said, C would be good now since it also supports later invasion at D (for example).]
;W[hm]
(;B[ck]LB[hn:B][ir:A]TR[hm]C[Hummm. Perhaps better a move near to R12?

Comment: Too deep invasion. Also notice that your bottom group is not completely safe after white played marked stone, so I would prefer playing A or perhaps B before anything else. See Variation.]

Comment: This is not good at all. There are many bigger moves, for example A would make white run towards your moyo and you could make large profit by chasing it.]
