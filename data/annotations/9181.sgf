C[e: Hey, my name is Evan, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'll concentrate on sente/gote timing, and fighting technique. I'll preface all my comments with "e:".  Hope you find this review helpful!]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dq];B[od];W[qo];B[pl];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp]
;B[oq];W[rq];B[mp]LB[dq:C][kq:A][lq:B]C[e: I find this move mildly questionable.  Compared to B, it gives you a higher position, but has a weak point at A.  Because C is a low white stone, the weak point benefits white - attacking those stones makes white territory.

So I'd prefer B.  But this is playable.];W[cj]C[I think this is correct. Enclosing the corner is big, but I can't develop the top or bottom now that black has formations in both corners. I think that if I enclose one corner, black will approach the other - while I'll get more solid territory that way, this makes it easier to apply pressure to his approach.

e: c10 does look good.];B[de]LB[pi:A][iq:B]C[e: I'd also consider A or B for black.  But d15 looks fine.]
;W[ce];B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[df]C[I didn't expect this variation because the ladder doesn't work. We kinda wander into a noseki. Could I have made life more quickly here and given up less influence on the top?

e: You do have choices.  I think you played well, though.];B[cc]
;W[db];B[bc];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb]LB[gc:A]C[e: If you want, here, you could give up the corner for more influence on the top, by playing at A.]

(;B[cf];W[ee];B[ed];W[gc];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[cg];B[bf];W[bg]
;B[dg];W[dh]LB[ef:A][eg:B]C[e: Better A than B.]
(;B[eg];W[ge]C[e: This push is a great help to white.];B[ef]
;W[mc];B[me]C[e: I think this was an excellent response.];W[kd]

(;B[do]LB[pi:B][qm:C][iq:A]C[e.This seems like a hard way to play.  There's easier territory to be made with moves like A, B, or C.]
;W[cm]
(;B[cq]LB[ip:A][eq:B]C[e: feels like the wrong direction to me. You have potential on the bottom side, so I'd try a move like A or B.]
;W[cr];B[cp]LB[aa:B][gq:A];W[gq];B[em]LB[en:C][jq:B][br:A]C[White's response here is not joseki, and I'm not sure that I handled it correctly.

e: If I were black, I'd take the point at A immediately.  It practically ensures eyes for the black group, threatens white's bottom stones, and is worth quite a bit in profit.

The problem with your move is that the white stones underneath are so strong that your move becomes gote - ignorable.  That means white can take to the offensive - taking an important point like A or B, or cutting at C.]

(;W[dn]
(;B[er]C[e: Interesting response!  But so complicated!];W[dr]
;B[eq]
(;W[ep];B[dp];W[fq];B[eo];W[fp];B[br]C[e: You do get a key point.  This strengthens your stones quite a bit, to the point where you can consider a counterattack on the left side.]
;W[es];B[en]C[e: Very solid move.];W[kq]LB[rr:A]C[White seems to get the best of that exchange :(

e: Agreed.  Your group is out, but your bottom potential has been wiped away.  The key point now is is A, which secures your eye shape while attacking the white stones above.]
;B[oo]LB[mn:B][rr:A]TR[pp]C[e: There's a proverb: "The one-space jump is never bad"

but there's an exception: When the enemy has a peeping stone already in place, like the marked stone.

I'd consider moves like A or B instead.];W[rl]C[e: this move drastically reduces black's side :(]
;B[ip]LB[ko:A][kp:B]C[e: This move is bad form.  You have weak groups to the left and right: Creating a new weak group right in the middle is sure to cause them both distress.

A or B have similar intentions but strengthen your right-side group instead of weakening it.]
;W[iq]LB[ko:A]TR[ep][fp][dq][fq][gq][cr][dr][es]C[e: White is needlessly submissive.  The marked stones are very strong, so white should not hesitate to counterattack at A.]
;B[kp]C[e: Black's result is shockingly good!];W[qj]LB[rm:A]
C[e: White invades more deeply.  There is a way to cut off these stones.]

(;B[qh]LB[qk:C][ip:A][kp:B]TR[qj]C[e: The wrong direction.  You gave up on right side territory when you left S8 unanswered.

R12 claims too little territory, and does it in gote.  Your past moves at A and B are emphasizing the center - so you can consider following up with C.]
;W[rh]LB[qi:A]C[e: White's given you another chance to build up your center! Why not reply at A?]

(;B[ri]C[e: This move emphasizes low side territory up above.  It's not a bad move!]
;W[qi];B[ph]LB[rg:A]C[e: Confused plan.  Taking the single stone by played at A makes more sense - settling for side territory.]
;W[oj]
(;B[rk]LB[rj:A]C[I suck at fighting :)

e: This move expresses a desire to cut off the white stones and fight them.  Unfortunately, that's difficult to do at this point.  With that aim, you should start earlier.

See the comment and branch at move 70.

Instead of your move, it now makes sense to play for humble side territory with A.]
;W[ql]
(;B[qk]LB[pk:A]C[e: Looked unreasonable - I was thinking A would be better.  But looking again, it's playable!]
;W[pk]
(;B[ok]LB[rj:A]C[e: This move is very bad form.  Don't atari a stone without good reason!  Black's position is much worse a result.

Playing at A instead is the only continuation.];W[pj]
(;B[rg]C[e: It's all black can do, now :(];W[rj];B[pn]LB[cl:B]
[jq:C][rr:A]C[e: It's not really sente! White can ignore you - and if white does response, she can take the far more valuable point of A.  If you're going to play anything in this area, A is the spot.

But there are more forceful moves to consider, like B or C.]
;W[qn]LB[rr:A]C[e: White should play A or tenuki.];B[hp]LB[jp:B]
[jq:A]TR[ip][kp][iq][kq]C[e: When you see the formation of the marked stones, you should try to play A before your oppenent can play B.]
;W[jq]LB[jp:A]C[e: White should have played A.  But either way, you lost a chance here.]
;B[nk]LB[nb:A][ke:B][cl:C]C[e: It makes some sense to go for some center points.  But doing so is completely gote! When it comes to making points, it's far more valuable to make them in sente, or at least in a way that has some impact on white's stones.  A, B, or C are examples of that kind of thinking - do something that impacts your opponent!]
;W[pm];B[nm]C[e: Good shape move.  But: It's gote!!];W[fi];B[eh]
;W[ei];B[di];W[dj];B[ch];W[bh];B[ek]LB[hi:A]C[e: Here, you peep at a cut.  White defends it, so the cut becomes impossible.  In return, you get E9.  E9 only slightly improves your position - white's new strength is far more valuable.

Consider a move like A instead!];W[ej];B[gk];W[jp];B[jo];W[ko]
;B[lp];W[io];B[jn];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[hj]C[e: Again, making a bit of territitory, but it's completely gote! You need to impact your opponent with your moves.]
;W[ob];B[bi];W[ci]LB[ag:A]
(;B[dh]LB[ag:A]C[e: There's a tesuji here.  Instead of connecting, play A!]
;W[bj];B[cl];W[dl];B[bl]C[e: The descent is good fighting form.  It's hard for white to answer.]

(;W[hi]LB[dk:A]C[e: gasp! A tenuki! Quick, play A before it's too late! The profit is enormous!!]
;B[hg]C[e: Trying to attack the whole group?  White's stones are very hardy, that's a tough maneuver to pull off.]
;W[ij];B[ii]C[e: great fighting spirit!];W[dm]C[e: White makes a mistake!]
;B[dk]C[e: Good.];W[fk];B[el]C[e: Nice - this capture is very big for black!]
;W[gg];B[hh]C[e: Superb response!];W[gi];B[hf]LB[gl:A]C[e: It's not a terrible point, but I'd fix the aji by playing A]
;W[gf]TR[hj][gk]C[e: White responded! you can save your stones!]
;B[id]LB[ji:A]C[e: This is greedy. White should ignore it and start carving up the center with A.]
;W[kf];B[ji]C[e: nice response!];W[ih];B[jg]C[e: perfect shape!]
;W[ie];B[ik]C[e: fantastic! This sequence went extraordinarily well for black - white made some very poor plays, and you took perfect advantage.]
;W[if];B[ig];W[pc]LB[gh:A]C[e: A tenuki? Black can cut at A, and white could likely die!]

(;B[ic]C[e: Looks like black's chasing illusions.];W[pd]LB[gh:A]
C[e: painful for Black, but at least he can play A, and kill a big group in exchange :)]
;B[pe];W[oe];B[of]LB[gh:A]C[e: Proper response locally. (globally, of course, you should take the 50 point kill at A)]
;W[ne];B[nf];W[nd];B[qc]C[e: dangerous move.  But maybe you can get away with it!]

(;W[qb];B[md];W[nc];B[qe]C[e: black played well here.];W[nj]
;B[lk];W[mf];B[mg];W[lf];B[lg];W[rb];B[rc];W[mr];B[lr]LB[nr:A]
C[e: Doesn't work.  Better to play A.];W[lq];B[mq];W[nr]
(;B[or]C[e: this move preserves a point or two, but in gote! Sente is too important to throw away like this.]
;W[ol];B[nl];W[si];B[cs]LB[bs:A]C[e: Good move! It's good you got to play here before white played A.]
;W[fr];B[ag]C[e: Good  - you're playing in sente now!];W[ai]
LB[gh:A]C[e: Last chance to kill all the white stones at A]
;B[af]LB[cb:B][gh:A][mj:D][rr:C]C[e: This is a one-point move.  There are much bigger ones, even disregarding the kill at A - you could make far more points at B, C, or D.]
;W[gh];B[jf];W[je];B[he];W[hd];B[ah];W[bi];B[jd]C[e: Don't atari without a plan! Otherwise you tend to make your opponent stronger at worst, or lose a ko threat at least.]
;W[ke];B[kc];W[kg];B[jh];W[ib];B[kh];W[hc];B[rr]C[e: Good point!]
;W[sr];B[nq]C[e: It's sente! Good!];W[kr];B[ns];W[ls];B[mi]
C[e: Another nice point!];W[se];B[re];W[sg];B[rf];W[sf];B[sd]
;W[mj];B[lj];W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[sh];W[mk];B[ml];W[fl];B[gl]
;W[in];B[im];W[hm];B[il]C[e: Good judgment here.];W[gm];B[fm]
;W[fj];B[hl];W[gn];B[cb]C[e: You're playing a good endgame - nabbing the important points!]
;W[on];B[om]LB[nn:A]C[Better to preserve your territory with A]
;W[nn];B[po];W[ll];B[mm];W[lm];B[mn];W[ln];B[mo];W[jm]C[e: Awww - you were simply out-read.]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[ri];W[op];B[no];W[rh];B[lo]LB[kl:B][km:A]C[e: This is the key to ko fights: Don't make threats that lose points!

M5 is an example of a points-losing threat.  When white plays A in response, the invasion grows stronger.  If you hadn't made this exchange, B would have preserved more center territory.

Now, even if you win the ko, you would only break even.  Another threat like this, and you'll have lost points whether or not you win!]
;W[km];B[kl];W[sg];B[np];W[qp];B[jl];W[kn];B[da]C[e: Good spot.]
;W[gb];B[sf];W[ea];B[ca];W[ds];B[bs];W[sb]C[e: Big, at least for this stage of the game.]
;B[sc]C[e: Dame.  Basically a pass.];W[mh];B[lh];W[ni];B[li]
;W[gj];B[jj];W[sh];B[ak]C[e: Good point!];W[ck];B[bm];W[pi]
;B[pg]LB[bk:A]C[e: You don't need to play it! Negative 1 point :(  Much more valuable to play A.]
;W[ol];B[os];W[ms];B[pl];W[bk]LB[bk:A]C[e: Fighting a half-point ko is bad when there are 2-point moves like A available on the board.]

e: Good game! You made many good moves, especially considering the rank gap.  

Try to keep in mind: 

Have a plan when you atari.

Keep the larger picture in mind  - where's your potential?

When you have a choice, take easy territory over stealing well-defended territory.

Don't lose points with ko threats!

Don't respond automatically! Read what happens if you tenuki.

Make moves that IMPACT your opponent's stones!
