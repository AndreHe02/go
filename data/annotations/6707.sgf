;B[pm]C[How to deal with B 33? What went wrong there? How could I make the most of my wall in the north? Was H18 an important position? What went wrong in the south-east? Why was mygroup surrounded so easily?

palleon86:  You had two vital mistakes that your opponent capitalized on.  First, you must attack your opponent's weak groups.  If you are having a hard time finding a move that gains you power or territory while attacking, at least find a move that gives your opponent trouble.  You absolutely can't let him live easily when you have such an advantage in numbers locally.

The second mistake was having too many weak groups.  Its ok to have one weak group if you gain compensation (you create a weak group for your opponent, gain a lot of points elsewhere, or something else).  Having two weak groups is almost always bad.  It gives your opponent a chance to launch a splitting attack and when that happens, you'll often have to choose one group or the other.  Try to keep your stones connected and split your opponents groups. 

H18 wasn't ever a vital point in this game.  Before the fighting started on the right, the top side was small; both players needed 2+ moves up top to make a big position.  After the fighting started it became the largest open area so it starts to look interesting but the fighting at this point would have been much bigger.once the fighting settles a play up top looks like the next place to play.

One more thing to remember:  If your opponent plays a "sente" move with a gote follow up, look to see if you can find a big move somewhere else.  Often times playing tenuki two times is bigger.]

;W[pj];B[cf]C[palleon86:  Sure at this point B has a good result in the top left but he spent four moves to do it.  Compared to what you can get on the rest of the board it seems like a good exchange.  And remember it's W's turn here.]
