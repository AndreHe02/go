;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[qf];W[of]LB[jd:A]C[greenbean [2d?\]: What to do here?

FM: this move is usually played when there is a white move at A.]

(;B[rd]C[FM: possible];W[qc];B[ph];W[ic]C[FM: this result is quite strange for white]
;B[jd]C[greenbean [2d?\]: This seemed okay but not sure maybe I should have just c14

FM: this move is not very good. Black does not know yet if he wants to invade or reduce here - it would be better to play elsewhere and decide later]

(;W[jc]C[greenbean [2d?\]: Maybe m16?

FM: I would slightly prefer white at J16 instead]
(;B[cf];W[ci]
(;B[ef]TR[jc][jd][ci]C[FM: usually you do not jump after the marked pincer though because of the marked exchange it is probably okay]

(;W[fc]LB[gd:A]TR[of]C[FM: weak move, playing on the fourth line is better here - black is the one who has weak group so white must put it under a pressure. Now black can play A later and make good shape too easily. Maybye white was afraid of sansan but the outside influence is much more important now, especially after white played a move like the marked one]
;B[bd]
(;W[kd]C[FM: extremely slow move, white is completely ignoring the option of attacking black the group on the left side]

(;B[cl]LB[cc:A][cm:B]C[FM: black is happy to take this point. But if blacks plan was to play A next then B would have been better here.]
;W[ei]LB[cc:A]TR[kd]C[FM: compare with the result if the marked stone was at A.]

(;B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[cm];B[dm];W[bm];B[dl];W[bk]LB[bl:A]C[FM: this move is bad because it leaves a lot of aji at A. White should have played A instead.]

(;B[en]LB[bj:A]C[FM: slow move. Maybye black was planning to continue around A]

(;W[fo]C[FM: a move that invites black to fight]
(;B[eo]C[FM: very slow];W[jp]
(;B[mq];W[gp]LB[gq:A]C[FM: A would make a little better shape]

LB[fg:A]C[greenbean [2d?\]: Not sure where to play after here
greenbean [2d?\]: Would love any comments on the game not sure there is much more to review then here.

FM: this result is very good for white considering the other variations that black had there. What used to be weak group here turned into strenght and black also lost points. Still there are chances for black to play on. The key points is the left group, which is still not settled and the difference of who plays first around A is very big.]
;B[me]C[FM: this is also nice place to play, but black must have in mind to play on the left side before white gets there]

(;B[lh]LB[ne:A]C[FM: it is better to tenuki than to play this move. Black really wants to leave the possibility to connect at A later and this move does not do much.]

(;B[oh];W[gk];B[hl];W[gl];B[km]
(;W[hm];B[kl]C[FM: now it is only endgame as the last group did make clear eyes (there are a few more comments after this move but nothing important).
The game was quite fun to watch - white played very slow fuseki, which gave black an advantage and then white was trying to catch up while creating weaknesses. Black did not succeed to exploit any of the weaknesses (you can see it clearly now - what black gained in the end around whites formerly weak groups) so white made it to the close end. If blacks technique was a little more precise then this would be a very hard game for white.

I hope you enjoyed my comments, feel free to mail me any problems you had with this to improve my future work! :)]
;W[hr];B[jr]C[FM: not small but I think it is not big enough now as capturing there is gote for white]
