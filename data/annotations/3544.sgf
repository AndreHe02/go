C[Dear Reviewer,
I played Black in this game, and lost by 0.5 point.
I am interested to learn about 'small' mistakes such as during the yose as well about 'big' mistakes on my strategy, so please do not spare any comments...
Thanks!];B[pd]C[

hello,

I reviewed your game. My comments are precedet by "jos"


It seems that you got out of the fuseki with a slight lead but failed to conserve it with the slow move Nr 47. Another mistake in my opinion was move Nr 55- see comment. those 2 moves changed the pace of the game considerably  but may not have been decisive yet. 
You actually lost during the yose when you failed to spot and play your sente moves.


I would like to thank fj from KGS for giving me some advice for the comments]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[lc];W[ne];B[pf];W[pb]C[jos: this exchange is considered bad for w because....]
;B[qc]TR[kb][pb]SQ[kd]C[jos: if b had played the 2point high pincer at L16, then w now could get a base by playing at L18 but b M17 denies this. The marked exchange prevents w from later invading at 3-3.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[fc]C[Is it the right approach? The result was that Black invaded the 3-3 point, but I felt that the Black group around M17 consumed a lot of energy to be kept alive.

jos: when playing F17 you have to expect a splitting attack from w]
;W[ic]C[ jos: I wasn't sure about this so I got some advice from fj ( KGS) 8d. He would enter 3-3 right now so the following sequence could happen:]

(;B[jd]LB[cc:B][jd:A]

LB[cc:A][ie:B]C[jos : not answering K15 leaves a lot of bad aji.]

;W[cg];B[ie];W[he]
(;B[jf]LB[hf:B][jf:A]C[jos: cutting is better. W can't resist with j13and if b captures J13 in a ladder, his position seems good. See var.]
;W[hf];B[lg];W[ni];B[li];W[mb]C[jos: actually i don't think the outcome is bad for b. He has taken territory in the upper left and on the right side and the M17 stones are not in immediate danger. B should now try to develop the lower side as it is the only place where he can claim more territory.]
;B[ih]C[jos: J12 looks quite slow and does not acomplish much, M11 should garantee the M17 stones a quick escape in times of need. I would have prefered to play on the lower side, around F3 for example.]
;W[qn]C[jos: In my opinion this is the wrong direction. 
W should play O3 and develop the lower side while limiting b at the same time. This would be a more postive aproach than just try to prevent the oponent from making territory.]

(;B[np]LB[qo:B][np:A]C[How about this answer? Should I have attached on R5 before this move?

jos: indeed, it seems important to prevent w from settling R6 too easily]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rk];B[ri];W[rq];B[cn]CR[bf][ih]TR[lq]MA[np]C[jos: looks like the wrong direction. The only place where b can make any noticeable territory is the lower side in combination with O4. If w tries to build up the left side, there is J12 and B14 to help reduce it.

Furthermore, the high position of O4 makes it vulnerable to an attack at M3.

It feels like C6 was played in the same spirit as w R6 : Instead of building up your own position you try to prevent your oponent from building up his.

It is said that Go is about taking and giving - your attitude feels like "NOT taking and NOT giving"]
;W[gq];B[jq]C[jos: now K3 is necessary since b can't allow w to aproach any further. In itself, K3 is a fine move, but now it gives w a third move to defend the corner and attack C6.]
;W[bo];B[co]C[Is it the right answer? The down side is that Black has completely secured the corner.

Actually there is not much that b can do about w getting the corner. B can try to complicate the situation with moves likeE3, e.g. but but then certainly the left side will suffer.]
;W[cp];B[bn];W[bp];B[cj]C[Is it too wide? The C8 invasion was not easy for Black...]
;W[cl]C[jos: wow, this should be an overplay.]
(;B[en]LB[dl:B][en:A];W[el];B[go];W[fp]
(;B[io]LB[ej:C][io:A]MA[bh][bl]C[jos: this feels too slow. It is w who has a weak group sandwiched between 2 b groups. You should not let it off the hook se easily
E13 therfore looks better to me. B has B8 and B12 if he needs to defend.]
;W[gl];B[il]MA[ni][qn]C[jos: J8 looks like B tries to meke some points in the center- but because of O11 and R6 he can't expect to get much out of it.]
;W[ej]MA[il]C[Jos: Having played J8, b gives up any attack on C8 so consequently you should try to get something from the center starting with R8 ot Q7.]
