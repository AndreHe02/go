RE[W+5.50]
TM[900]

C[As I (derhannes, black) lost by just 5 points, I don't think something fundamentally went wrong. If I am mistaken, tell me.

If I am right, please tell me where I could have gotten (at least) those 5.5 points that made me loose.

J: Hello! I am Joe, roughly 2d. All my comments start with 'J'. I added quite a few variations, I hope it helps.]
;B[od]C[This was a misclick, actually (due to using a touchpad). But who wants to undo his first move? ;-)

J: Good to vary things up anyways. You learn more.];W[dp];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[qd];W[nq];B[pn]C[Is this sensible (given the stones in the upper right)?

J: I think so.];W[pr];B[qq];W[kp]TR[lq]LB[kq:A][lp:B]C[J: This white move is not joseki. Joseki here calls for a move at either 'A' or 'B'. Now white has a weakness at the marked point, which black can invade at a later point.]

(;B[pj];W[pg]C[J: As a general rule, in the opening you should avoid creating weak groups. This white move is too aggressive.]

(;B[md]C[J: Best to protect the corner against the peep here at Q16.]

(;W[ne];B[nd];W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qc];W[re]C[J: White is alive, but you got a decent position on both the top and right side. You lead at this point.]

(;B[cj]C[How would you judge C10 compared to Q8?

J: C10 is much better. Q8 is timid. See comments attached to the Q8 move.]
;W[pl]C[J: This is too early for w to invade. This is going to be a running group.]
;B[qm];W[ql]
(;B[cm]C[J: Some options are available to immediately attack white's invasion. See variations.]
;W[cg];B[bp];W[cq];B[eq]C[Invading at G3/H3 would be more usual, I suppose. However, I thought that this was the weakness of his two stones shape. If he attacked, I could counterattack.
What do you think about than?
 At least it did not come out too bad.

J: You should look at the weaknesses of the bottom as a whole. Since white omitted joseki earlier, plays at M3 or J3 are better invasion points.
Your position on the left is a little thin, which makes these stones hard to pressure.]

(;W[gq];B[iq];W[ip]
(;B[hp]C[J: This isn't the first move I would look at. K4 and G3 seem the most natural continuations.]

(;W[jq];B[io]
(;W[ep];B[jp]C[J: This capture is big, white is too nice.];W[kq]

(;B[ko]C[J: This feels like a natural move to get eyes, but this group is tough to attack, and the continuation seems to help white.]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[ln]C[J: Whites stones at Q8 are looking better after the last couple moves.]
;B[jc]C[My judgement was that all of my groups were more or less save. So I decided to extend. Should I have attacked the upper left first, and extend after the corner sequence?

J: This is timid. This is similar to the Q8 move you were considering earlier. You are saying that this is all I want and you can have the rest of the top. 

You could justify a move like this if your upper right was weak, but it is already very strong. This is too close. A play around F17 would be called for here.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[bq];B[cc]C[My sequence worked, but please tell me if this was the proper way. to get the corner.

J: This is fine. D17 and D18 also possible here.];W[dc];B[cd]

;B[gc];W[fc];B[gd];W[bo];B[bn];W[ao];B[an];W[ap];B[co];W[cp]
;B[ci];W[bh];B[dm]C[J: I'm a bit confused about this move. It is very slow, and doesn't really improve your position much. 

You are alive here. Maybe consider sealing white in with N13 or attacking white with O7. If you are worried about weak groups, the lower right seems to be the worst off.]
;W[do];B[cn]C[J: Small again.];W[em];B[dk]C[J: This is another move that says "This is all I want". This group is not in danger, but if you were to play on it, you should build towards the center.]
;W[km];B[in];W[el];B[ej]C[J: Slow.];W[qr];B[rr];W[pq];B[rq]
;W[op];B[po];W[rl];B[rm];W[nl]C[J: Your chance to attack a weak group is lost. White has no weak groups now. You on the other hand have 2 groups that dont have 2 complete eyes yet.

Black still seems to have a lead, but how these groups are handled can change everything.]
;B[mg];W[nf];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[pm];B[rn]C[J: Bad shape. S5 is best for life.]
