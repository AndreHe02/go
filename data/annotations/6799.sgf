C[Hi, my name is Kyle Blocher, 4-dan from the United States.  I thought I played a pretty good game here, and was wondering how White got the game in the end (I thought I was ahead towards the middle).

Thank you for the review.];B[pd]C[linkai [3d\]: hi
linkai [3d\]: enjoy
ago1 [4d\]: hi];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[jq]C[linkai: I've seen this move infrequently.

Donal: Although white 6 is far from the left corner, it is ideally positioned to erase the influence of black 3, so it seems fine.]

(;B[cq]LB[dq:A][lq:C][dn:B]C[Because white 6 is so far away, invading at the 3-3 point seems questionable. When White blocks at A, the position of white 6 becomes ideal. I would suggest playing black 7 at B or C instead. (See diagram.)]

(;B[qo];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]C[With white 20, I think that White has a slight lead. The combination of black 17 and 19 is slightly overconcentrated, while White has better balance.]
;B[cf]LB[hc:A]C[Again, since Black is really strong on the lower left, it's slightly over-concentrated to play at 21. An invasion at A would be better. This uses strong position on the right to attack White's thin position.]
;W[ef]LB[df:B][dg:C][ce:D]C[linkai: I thought this wasn't so good, as Black can still invade around M17.

Donal: Since Black is already strong on the left side, it's better to attach at B. If black C, then white D.]
;B[cc]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[Black 23 is good. If White blocks at A he will have poor shape with white 22 in the wrong place. So he should block at B. (See diagram.)]

(;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[cb];W[db];B[pb]TR[cf][cn]LB[kf:A][kp:B]
C[linkai: I am aware of the weakness of these stones, but I don't want to play anymore on the lower side as it is not interesting.

Donal: The problem is that White may be able to exploit those weknesses to make a huge center territory. Black 29 doesn't address this problem. Some move like black A or B to limit White's framework might be one way.]
;W[ne];B[lc]LB[em:A][cm:B][cg:C][nb:D][mb:E][oc:F]C[Up through black 29, Black has been playing a very slow game and with white 30 White seems to have a good lead. White A forces black B, and White also can attach at C. White could end up with a lot in the center.

It would have been better to jump in directly at 31 without playing 29 first. When White defends at 30 it's more usual to attach at D instead of invading, and then when White blocks at E, force at F. But in this game, White would have too much on the upper side. Black therefore makes a somewhat desperate move at 31.]
;W[oc];B[le]LB[jc:A][ic:B][id:C][pc:D]C[When White plays 32, he is threatening to break into the corner, so Black has to be prepared to allow that and take compensation on the upper side. This position resembles a ko fight, as White is going to ignore one of Black's moves and break into the corner. That being the case, Black 33 is too passive. He should attach at A, and if White blocks at B he should crosscut at C. Now if White plays D, Black will have lots of opportunities on the upper side.]

(;W[pc];B[qc];W[qd]LB[qe:A][qb:B]C[Black cannot avoid giving something up. The simplest is just to atari at A and let White cut at B and capture black 29. Note that White now has eyes, so black 33 is ineffective as an attack. (See diagram.)]

(;B[qb]LB[qe:A][pe:B]C[Black 37 is really risky. White can start a fight by crawling at A, and he gets the upper hand. (See diagram.) Or he can start a ko fight by playing at B, but Black does all right in that case. (See diagram.)]

(;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[rd]C[Correct for Black?];W[of];B[qf];W[kc]

(;B[kb]LB[og:A][ng:B][nh:C][lg:D]C[linkai: After White cuts me, maybe this move is a little weak.

Donal: That's true, but even more important is that these stones don't threaten White. So they aren't worth saving. I would hane at A, and when White plays B, follow up with C. But it's difficult to win at this point.

Running away with a move like D is not so good, because Black's territory on the right will be reduced.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[kd];B[mc];W[me];B[nb];W[ob];B[ma];W[jb];B[oa]
;W[ka];B[lb]LB[pn:A][cg:B][dn:C][oi:D]C[linkai: It seems Black got pushed around a little here, but the invasion was relatively (?) successful.

Donal: it's not a success, because Black is so low and White has become much stronger in the center Next White has moves like A, B, C, and D. White's thickness ended up costing you the game.]
;W[em]
(;B[lf];W[oh]C[Black 59 is just unreasonable. It does threaten White's group, but when White runs away at 60 he is completely safe and in addition is erasing Blacks's territory on the right.]
;B[ng];W[og];B[jf];W[id];B[hf];W[rg];B[pd];W[mg];B[ge];W[gc]
;B[mq]LB[ii:A][cg:B][cm:C]C[linkai: Is tenuki a good choice here?  I thought that this was the biggest point and there was little to attack on the right side.  The Black group seems to be able to take care of itself as well.

Donal: Black 71 is big, but other points are more critical. Black should play A, B, or C.]

Donal: I think the biggest point is at black A (see diagram.)]

;B[mo]LB[mr:A][kn:B]C[Donal: There's no reason to cut at 13. This doesn't attack White and it doesn't gain any territory. In general, cutting and connecting moves are neutral points, and are only worth playing if there is some strategic advantage to be gained. It's better to just play at A or B.]
;W[lp];B[kl]C[linkai: I felt I had little choice but to defend.

Donal: This is the result of your original play at 59 which created a group that could be easily attacked.]
;W[mr]C[When White plays 16, Black loses a lot of points. The exchange of Black 13 for White 16 is a huge loss for Black. The game is over here.

Actually, I think the biggest problem is in the fuseki. Slow moves like Black 7, 19, 21, and 29 are slowly adding up, and then Black has to resort to unreasonable moves like 31 to try to catch up. Try to maintain a faster pace from the start, so you don't have to do anything special later on to win.]
