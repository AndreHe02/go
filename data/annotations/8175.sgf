C[I lost everything in the endgame... I'd like to know my biggest mistakes and how to play better instead of those moves.

Im playing black

I maybe lost because i started to overplay

I marked the continuations with a triangle

R: Hi!  My name is Riaan, I am a 3k on kgs from south africa!

I thought you played a nice game, but you did get greedy later on!  I tried to comment as best I could, I hope you find some of my comments useful!

In general, I think you should just try to play a little more calmly and take your time to think about moves even if you are certain about them!]

;B[or];W[qk];B[jq]C[is this necessary or is this at a good point?

R: It is not needed.  Approaching a corner would be much larger.  You are becoming overconcentrated on the bottom side now.  That side is already uninteresting due to your strong group at p3.]

C[was this too far away? ive actually never seen a move like this in a pplace like this but i decided to try

R: Locally I think P12 is better.  This move seems awkward.  Ask yourself what exactly this stone is doing though?  Square points you had secured before this move.  Moves in this direction barely secures you 6 triangle points of easily reducible territory and some center influence.  And it's gote also!  Not good.  A top left corner approach would be at least 20 points bigger.]

(;B[bf]C[R: I think threatening the corner like this is better than taking the side.  Corner territory is a lot more valuable.  I think white should respond to this.]

;W[oh]C[at this point i started to lose. white got a lot in the center, which should be hard, so i must have done something wrong. maybe the big jump at O12, and helping white at F16, because theres a nice wall

R: Yes, O12 was a bit strange.  The F15 loss was definitely also a problem.  I think you should keep an eye on the center during the game.  If you play into your opponent's hand he can score a lot!  However, even here the center territory has a lot of weakness!  Don't panic!  Calm reductions like O8, J5 and F9 wil do immense amounts of damage.  I think you lost a lot more by getting greedy in the bottom center later.]

Thanks for commenting my kifu!

R: No problem!  I think you played allright.  You lost a lot because of tactical mistakes, but this can be fixed with life and death problems!  Also, I think you should try not to panic - it clouds the mind and lets you make emotional moves which are not thought through properly.  Good luck and have fun!]
