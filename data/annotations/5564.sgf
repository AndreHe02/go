C[Dear Reviewer,



I chose this game because it seems I was behind by a few points for most of the game. In the end I caught up to take the lead by a few points, so after counting, my opponent resigned. In this game I cannot really find any mistakes I made myself. Thats why I believe it is a good game to review.



I have added comments about my thoughts during the game and after.



It would be great to identify where the biggest weaknesses in my game is, so I can specifically work towards improving that. Also any comments about how you think I should continue studying would be great.



Thank you very much for looking at this game

;W[dp]C[Chris: I felt like solid terretory in this game so I went for this variation hoping to get a shimari in the top left to restrict blacks influence, before he can approach there.]

(;W[qi]C[Chris: Even though my group will suffer a bit, I thought it would be imperative to get a stone on the right side, before black can utilise his shimari properly.

janr: usually white plays as in te variation, keeping black low without the possibility to separate white in two weak groups]
;B[om]LB[qk:B][pl:A]C[janr: Black may also consider A or B]

;B[ic];W[gc];B[ld];W[oi]C[Chris: This move was difficult to come up with and I really am not sure what move would have been bigger or more urgent instead.

janr: this move is a good and simple idea.  As white is ahead, he does not need to do complicated things.]
;B[ml]C[janr: Black has even to defend];W[dj]C[Chris: This is another one of those moves. I am not sure where the biggest/most urgent point on the board is.

janr: it is the last open place, so it can not be bad];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[db]
(;W[bc]C[janr: the variation shows another possibility, that keeps the situation simple.  As white is ahead, there is no need to start complications]
;B[ec];W[cb];B[ed];W[kc];B[kd]LB[lc:A]C[janr: it may be better for black to play A and to start a fight]

(;W[nc]C[janr: this is dangerous.  White should be sure to live

I think it is simpler to not strengthen black and just start the favorable running battle in the variation]
