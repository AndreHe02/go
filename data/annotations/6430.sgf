C[daveadams: Hello, I'm your reviewer, daveadams. 4k on KGS. Thanks for submitting a game for review. I hope you find my comments helpful.

My main comment is that you missed a lot of opportunities to spread out and play in Black's sphere of influence long before he built a moyo and long before your plays would have been called "invasions". You were playing endgame-sized moves while there were still open starpoints. You say you want to work on your transitions between game phases, so my recommendation is this: stay in the fuseki longer. You are not done with opening moves once the four corners have been played in. Try to balance your play across the board. Once you got around to thinking about "invasions" it was too late. You should have played those moves in the first 30-40 plays instead of late in the game.]

(;W[jp]C[daveadams: I think you'd be better off responding at F4 or C5 (see variations)]
;B[cq]
(;W[eq]C[jeff: how do you feel about this move?

daveadams: I think it's too heavy and too slow. If you had a stone at G4 or H4 this would be a better looking move, but you are too far from K4 to play so heavy. Black doesn't take advantage, but he probably could

C2 is the right response to Black's attachment. See variation.]
;B[qn];W[qp];B[qk];W[mq]C[daveadams: Your lower side is getting very strong, but notice that you don't have any stones above line four, while Black is spreading out all over the board. This is a dangerous situation.]
;B[cr]
(;W[ol]C[daveadams: Capping the black stones on the R line does you no good since they can just expand up the board towards the Q16 stone. P6 would at least have been expanding your influence, but P8 is too far away given R6 to really feel connected to your stones on the bottom.

Better I think to have played your P8 stone as a kakari on one of the top two Black stones and spread out your stones a bit more.See variations.]
;B[gp];W[gq]C[jeff: where should white have played instead?

daveadams: I think G3 is the right play locally, and it turned out fine for white.]
;B[on];W[fp];B[go];W[hp];B[ho];W[hq];B[fo]
(;W[dr]SQ[do][fo][go][ho]C[daveadams: It's a little early to play here. At most this saves you 5-8 points in the endgame, while the whole top of the board is empty except for some Black stones.

Also, notice Black's thickness (squared stones) facing up the board towards D16. He can use that thickness to stop invasions and project power up the board. This type of position, with White so low and Black wrapping around two sides, getting the corner and building a big wall facing out, is unquestionably far better for Black.

Given Black's wall and White's lack of presence on the left and top, now might be a good time to play a miai move like C11 (see variation).]
;B[np];W[nq];B[op];W[oq];B[po];W[mp]C[daveadams: This move gives a nice strong shape, but it's a tiny, tiny move compared to what's available on the board. This early in the game, whenever you are not immediately threatened by Black's play, you should look for big moves to play elsewhere on the board. Don't get sucked into the trap of just focusing on the part of the board where Black played last. You want to take the initative.]
;B[oj];W[ml];B[ln];W[mn];B[jd]C[daveadams: Here, Black played a huge point while White is still playing small moves at the bottom.]
;W[om]C[daveadams: Tiny move.];B[pm];W[pl]C[daveadams: One point move at most.]
;B[ql];W[nn]C[daveadams: You are very strongly connected now, but the stones at P8 aren't doing anything for you. They aren't projecting influence, attacking Black, or surrounding territory.]
;B[oo];W[io]C[daveadams: Tiny move.];B[qo];W[rp]C[daveadams: Small move. If Black never blocks at S5, you'll get at most eight points from this.]
;B[cg]C[daveadams: Black expands his framework, playing another big move.]
;W[dj]C[jeff: how do you feel about this move?

daveadams: It's a decent choice for an invasion in that area. The fourth line is optimal I think, since you should be aiming not to make territory there, but to run out and connect, but White is in dire straights. You should have played in this area long before.]
;B[ck];W[em];B[dk];W[eo];B[en];W[ep];B[dm];W[fn];B[dn];W[fm]
;B[ej];W[hn]C[daveadams: You captured a few Black stones, and destroyed Black's wall, but he already got his use out of it, and White only gets eight points. Meanwhile, Black E10 kills your D10 stone and makes Black's moyo look incredibly strong.]
;B[jl];W[lm]C[daveadams: This move is not tiny, but it is the wrong play. You should be invading Black's moyo. Nothing is more important right now.]
;B[jn];W[kn];B[km];W[lo];B[jj]C[daveadams: Black is not playing the best moves, but with this move, do you see how he's built a huge moyo covering half the board and controlling six star points? This is White's worst nightmare.]
;W[li];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk];W[lk];B[pg];W[ji]C[daveadams: Attaching like this will make Black stronger, and since you have plenty of room to play, you should look for broader moves. I would invade at M17 and use the M11 stone as a target to connect back to.]
;B[ij]C[daveadams: Like I said, attachment makes Black stronger.]
;W[gh]C[daveadams: Too far if you are trying to stay connected, given Black's stone at J10.]
;B[hi];W[hh];B[ii];W[ih];B[fi];W[jo]C[daveadams: Bad move, you should have connected at K12.]
;B[jh]C[daveadams: Black has cut you off. Your J12 stones are dead if they can't make two eyes.]
;W[mi];B[ok];W[hc]C[jeff: was this a good time to play this kind of a move?

daveadams: At this point in the game, it's necessary for White to play desperately. The right time to play in the vicinity of H17 would have been about 50 moves back. Also, when you invade you should have a plan for making life or getting connected. M17 would have a better chance of connecting up to the M11 stones. You might connect to H11, but it doesn't have life yet either.]

;B[gf];W[ff];B[ge];W[fd];B[fe];W[ec]C[daveadams: You lived, but Black played poorly.]
;B[fh];W[fb];B[ed];W[og];B[of];W[hf];B[if];W[jg]C[daveadams: what would happen if white had given up these stones?

The stones look dead and purposeless at this point. It's okay to sacrifice stones if you use them to achieve a bigger goal. Perhaps these stones helped you create life up top in which case they are no longer needed. And you should leave them alone. Their aji might serve you later on.]
;B[kh];W[kg];B[lh];W[lg];B[mh];W[ig];B[jf];W[mg];B[nh];W[ng]
;B[oh]C[daveadams: Now you have cut off any chance of expanding your M11 stones into Black's territory and you have a new big heavy group that needs life badly with very little room to expand.]

(;W[cd]C[jeff: what is a better place for this stone?

daveadams: I think C17 is what you are looking for. See variation.]

;B[me];W[da]C[daveadams: Turns out Black let you get a big corner, but I still think C16 was a bad play.]
;B[la];W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[kl];W[ll];B[sp];W[bh];B[bg];W[dg]
;B[ef]C[jeff: what should white do in this case?

daveadams: Not sure what you are asking. White is playing inside Black's strong territory. White should have immediately defended at T3, because Black S3 could be huge.]

;W[fj];B[eh];W[gi];B[fk];W[gj];B[gk];W[hk];B[hj];W[ki];B[hl]
;W[rm];B[qm]C[daveadams: In the end you were able to make life along the top and secure quite a bit of territory. Given Black's moyo, it was a very unlikely thing. Still it looks like White lost by 20 or 30 points, mainly because in the opening stages, white kept playing on the bottom while Black took huge point after huge point at the top. Had White spread out more early on he would have been a lot better positioned to win the game.

I will say that you did a great job taking the corners on the top, and you show some good fighting skill. Focus on the opening moves, building a better position to start from, and you will get much stronger.

Thanks again for submitting this game for review, I hope my comments are helpful to you.]

(;W[ci]C[daveadams: This move gives White miai at C8 and C14. In other words, Black will likely play in one of those two places (or nearby), but White can immediately play in the other, forming a solid group and preventing Black from making the entire left side his territory.]

Black is building territory in this continuation, but you also have strong territory at the bottom and in the C14 group, and good invasion options at Q12/R12, H16/H17, and C7/D7. Black can also invade the bottom at H3/H4.]
