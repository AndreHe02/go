C[Hi,
I'm Cooper... 1d kgs.  hope my comments are helpful.

You played well towards the end... and managed to pull together a lost game.

You had trouble managing the bottom right corner throughout this game... I tried to show you some better ideas.]

LB[rb:A][lc:B]C[CC: You shouldhaveagood reason for playing such a strange move...

Problems: 1) it leaves the top right vulnerable... 2) by leaving Black with A... it is very hard to attack these stones in the future. 3) it doesn't really secure any points on the top and actually leaves a very easy invasion at B

I recommend sticking with more solid shapes instead]
(;B[qh]C[This seems slack for B.  He has S18 to secure base... so he doesn't really NEED this super safe move here.]
;W[qp];B[qn]C[I'm curious of this lower right side, I felt there were mistakes on both sides, but can't pinpoint them.]
;W[po]
(;B[rq]C[Odd.  Usual variation gives a much simpler/better result.
White is happy to see this strange mistake.];W[qq];B[rp];W[pn]
C[Very good move! press black down to punish him for his mistake.]
;B[qm]
(;W[np]C[CC: This move doesn't look right.  Its the right direction, but the wrong spot.  see variations.]
;B[iq];W[pm];B[fq];W[ql]C[CC: Very good! punish black for his tenuki]
;B[qr];W[pr];B[ro]
(;W[cn]C[CC: IMPORTANT COMMENT

This is a big move.  But you are in the middle of a fight on the lower right, so it is better to finish that first. Play URGENT moves (those that have to do with severe attacks and avoiding severe attacks) before BIG plays like C6

If you had capturesed the r2 stone here the game would have been very good for you.]
;B[rl]
(;W[dr]C[CC:  again... it is more important to secure your stones in the bottom right and pressure blacks stones there.

This is a big play but not the urgent play....];B[lq]
(;W[rb]LB[ob:C][lc:A][kd:D][qd:B]C[CC: better to exchange Q8 for B S9 before making this move. 

This move leaves a very easy invasion at A -- and you don't have a chance of attacking blacks stones so there isn't a good reason to play it.  simple would be better or D to take the top might be more interesting.]
;B[nr]
(;W[or]C[CC: This is not the best move for securing your group]
;B[nq];W[oq];B[qk];W[ci]
(;B[mp]C[CC: black lets you off easy here. settling your shape for you.. he gets little in return]
;W[no];B[kd]C[how to handle stone such as this as white?

C: black is keeping you from making pointson the top.  just keep his stone week and secure your group and try to make points elsewhere.]
;W[lc]C[this doesn't keep his group weak... attacking or shoulder hitting strengthens the opponents stone.]
;B[ld]
(;W[nf]C[Nope.  if you aren't prepared to defend your M17 stone... then just don't play it.]
;B[mc];W[nc];B[mb];W[jc];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[jd]C[CC: Not the best];W[jb];B[lg];W[pg];B[qg];W[eh]C[CC: you can't afford to tenuki in the upper right.. your group is weak.

Remember play moves that relate to a fight before big moves]
;B[dj]C[CC:  bad move for black... unclear what his plan is with this move...]
(;W[dl]C[CC: too fancy.  just take the points that he is gonna give you - see var]
;B[cj];W[fj];B[di];W[dh];B[ch];W[cg];B[bi];W[bg]C[too aggressive... black can cut you apart and you will not be happy]
(;B[ek]
(;W[fk]C[CC: Better to just fix your shape right away instead]
;B[el];W[ef]C[CC: had to do that eventually..];B[en]C[CC: This way not great... cause he loses sente.... but overall black is happy because he totally destroyed your territory on the left.]

;W[dg];B[bc];W[jf]LB[qb:B][kd:A]C[CC: this is the big moment to see if you stratagy of building up thickness and letting black destroy your territory is going to pay off. Its very hard to even think about killing the black A group.... your B group is still so weak that you don't have many attack options... game is lost at this point.]

C[CC: good];B[jh]C[CC: ABSOLULETELY HORRIBLE. Black has to escape here... i don't know what hes thinking... losing a won game]
;W[lj];B[mi];W[pi]C[CC: Good... he might fall for it];B[mj]
;W[qi]C[CC: game changer... this gives you a good chance to win now... black had to keep those points to stay in the lead.
