C[briguy:  Let me first say that though the score is listed as white winning by 21.5, actually I (black) should have won by 8.5.  I accidently removed the wrong group, which made the difference.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[ep]LB[jq:A]C[fess: This move seems questionable. With b's corner enclosure a b move at A is good and with this w move, a move around A would serve as sort of a loose pincer as well.]
;B[cm]LB[jq:A][iq:B]C[I looked for this move in Dictionary of Basic Joseki. It wasn't there but that doesn't mean it is bad locally. It seems OK to me, but A or B would probably be better.]
;W[cq];B[do]LB[bp:A][dp:B]C[This move seems a little passive to me. I don't know if A or B would be better or not.]
;W[dq];B[jq]C[Good move!];W[hq];B[jo]C[Another good one. Nice moyo!]
;W[ho];B[qi]C[Another good one. Moyo is huge!];W[jd];B[qf]LB[cg:A]
C[I wonder if A is bigger first, but this is still good.];W[rd]
;B[cg];W[fc];B[be];W[bd];B[cj]LB[nc:A][qc:B][lc:C][hc:D]C[Later you make the comment that w gets the whole bottom. It looks like the top to me, but, in any case, I think that looking for an earlier opportunity to invade is a good idea. The game move solidifies your territory, but it is not unreasonable to consider an invasion at one of the marked points.]
;W[ql]C[briguy:  I wanted to play here before, but since that would have been gote, I refrained from doing so.
fess: Don't feel bad about this. w's stone is really weak and a target for your attacks. If you had the chance, I would invade rather than play here yourself. Your chances of successful invasion at the top are much better than w's here.]
;B[oi]LB[ol:A][pm:B]C[Attacking w's stone is good. A or B are alternatives. The game move has the advantage of strengthening b's weaker side, but A or B might lead to a bigger moyo.]
;W[ol];B[on]TR[oi]C[briguy:  with these two moves I was trying to attack & get territory at the same time.  Anything else I could have done?
fess: I think your thinking is basicly sound here];W[lo];B[mm]
LB[lq:A]C[This splitting attack is strong, but I am a little concerned for b's stones on the k column. Playing arround A is probably a key point for either side, although probably not right now.]
;W[kn];B[mq]C[good!];W[lq];B[lr];W[nk];B[mi];W[lk];B[ki]LB[kl:A]
C[This move is a little weak. It is not necessary for the defense of b's group, doesn't build much territory, and doesn't attack w's weak groups as much as a splitting attack at A would. This a great time for an invasion at the top.]
;W[mp];B[nq];W[np];B[op];W[mr];B[kq];W[nr];B[lp];W[kp];B[lq]
;W[jp]
(;B[iq]C[Passive. See alternates.];W[ip];B[oe];W[od];B[ne]C[briguy:  again trying to attack (with a shoulder hit) while building a moyo.  The only problem is this also gives him a strong wall to seal off the whole bottom.
fess: Yes, at any point in this sequence an invasion would be better. This moyo is not that big for the number of stones in it. w's is bigger. The 2 rows of b stones are too close together for maximum efficiency.]
;W[nd];B[me]LB[le:a][lc:b][hc:c]C[briguy:  upon consideration, a seems like it would have been a better move.  True?
fess: Not really. It is the same idea. An invasion is better.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[le];W[ke]LB[lc:a]C[briguy:  at this point, it seemed as if a would be a good place for a successful attack to break up his bottom territory.  It worked out after a fashion, but it seems as if it should have been done better initially.
fess: You have some potential here, but exactly how to best exploit it is unclear. See alternate line for an idea.]

(;B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[mn]C[fess By this point w has cleaned up a lot of his problem points.]
;B[nn];W[lm];B[no];W[mo];B[ef]LB[gf:A][ff:B]C[Good idea, but I like A or B better.]
;W[gf];B[fn]LB[gm:A][gn:B]C[briguy:  again, trying to attack & gain territory in sente.
fess: Yes, might consider A or B to reach a little higher.]
;W[hm];B[go];W[gp];B[gl];W[hl];B[gk];W[hk];B[gi]LB[fh:A]C[A better to prevent w's playing there. "Your enemies vital point is your own."]
;W[fh]C[this sequence has been good for b but w's move is a very serious threat.]
;B[ig]C[No! Urgent to deal with f12.];W[if];B[gg]C[briguy:  this works, but it seems like it shouldn't have.  Was this the right thing to do?
fess: Not wrong, but it should not have worked this well. See alternate.]
;W[gh];B[fg];W[hh];B[eh]
(;W[hg];B[fi]TR[fh][gh][hh]C[briguy:  he played that exactly how I wanted him to, which always makes me nervous.  I guess that he was more concerned about protecting the triangle stones then invading my moyo.
fess: Yes, he had 2 ways to connect so he should have exploited your weakness a little more.]

;W[pk];B[lc]C[briguy:  this is the invasion that doesn't seem to work, though I feel like it should have somehow.  Maybe I am just expecting it to go like it would have one line lower.
fess: At this point it is too late to expect too much from this. You ultimately got a lot but you were lucky that he didn't see a shortage of liberties situation.]

;W[rr];B[rp]LB[ik:a][qc:b]C[briguy:  he played at a (J8) next when the biggest move is at b (R17).  Variation 2 shows how the game would have ended if he had played correctly.  Since he was ahead by ~10 points, he should have played very conservatively at this point, or at least so it seems to me.
fess: Yes, these shortage of liberty plays are hard to spot for both sides. You did well with this.]

(;W[ik];B[qc]C[briguy:  Variation 2 is what I hoped that he would do, but either way, this should have won the game for me if I hadn't removed the wrong group at the end.
fess: he wins variation2 if he plays it right. see subvariation]
