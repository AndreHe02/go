C[Dear reviewer:
  Thanks for your kindness to review my game.

  I play black. There are several mistakes on the LR. And please indicates
when white miss the chance on the UL.

  Most of the variations are on B103. Trying to reduce white's territory and
develop walls towards the center. Please check those variations.

Leonard,

This is a good game of course. You'd have won even without White losing his group in the UL. You show good tactical skills and also some global vision. My advice is that you should consider more simple moves more often: play an extension rather than a hane, a solid move rather than a jump, etc. because your stones are sometimes too thin. Thanks to your good fighting skill, you managed well with your thinness in this game, but you were often on the razor's edge (like at move 74). Also, keep in mind the fundamentals about cutting and connecting: don't allow your opponent to cut you, don't miss an opportunity to cut your opponent.

Good luck.

;W[fo];B[fp];W[cn];B[kq];W[hq];B[ip]C[zbuh:  h4 looks better to me: the white stone is more efficiently neutralized, your thickness is improved, your four stones are safer. Avoid creating opportunities for your opponent to cut through your stones.]

C[zbuh:
This isn't very safe as illustrated by White's next moves. To keep things more simple, you could play m4 (play hane against a tsuke) or even simpler m3, heading to your stones in LR. You needn't worry too much about your stones h5 h6 : they are in the open and potentially connected as you can capture the three white stones below. In addtion, White will have hard work putting his thin stones to good use: you needn't be too aggressive and should take the opportunity to play a safe and territory making move.]

(;B[hs];W[lq]C[Is losing the territories here favors black?

zbuh:
My point of view is that Black made a strong group with a significant influence in the centre, while White's is weak and there's still the painful cut at q6. Black's result is ok.
But Black could have taken the territory and left White a not very strong position on the outside. I think this would have been a better outcome.]
;B[qj]C[zbuh:
Don't miss an opportunity to cut: take q6. You should then be able to either pressure the White stones at the bottom or take the fourth line on the right side.]

C[Should be at A right?

How could black response to it correctly?

zbuh:
Agreed, a is better. k17 is a good answer: it's sente and works well with the stone at f17.]

(;B[jc];W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[Is this the correct side to defend?

zbuh:
No, the right direction to defend against an invasion at san san is usually to block White's most promising escape routes, i.e. to cut him off from his stones outside. To the left, White can try and connect his stone, while to the bottom he'll meet Black's relative strength: it's the latter scenario that you should prefer.
Hence you should play p18. The variation you proposed is another possible answer. It's not a big problem if White lives in the corner: he'll be small, likely gote, and you'll get plentiful of thickness to severely attack White's fledgling o17 l17 f16 stones.
I suspect you wanted the corner for yourself. This is a mistake. When you play p17 - o16 - q14 against the o17 kakari (an acceptable choice when you have a stone at k16 as in the game), you must be aware that the corner remains vulnerable to an invasion.]
;W[ob]C[zbuh:
Here, White improves the safety of a group you had an opportunity to pressure. The territory you get in exchange is not very big.]
;B[cj]C[zbuh:
Rather at c12, to put pressure on the White stones above.];W[ch]
;B[ej];W[di];B[dj];W[rc];B[cc]C[zbuh:
This move says: I want the corner, cut me off from f17. In such a position, this isn't good, because your group k17 k16 f17 will be pressured between two strong White positions. Just exchanging d18 for c17 in sente is enough. After that, you could place a good claim on the centre with o14. e6 or something around is also promising. But it's not a time for you to lose sente and, worse, to make your stones at the top a target for attack.]

C[I've researched for this shape. I believe that black is unconditionally
alive.

zbuh:
Yes, but you're gote, and White can easily go after your stones at the top and regain some control in the centre in the process.]

;W[pk];B[ok]C[zbuh:
This won"t connect. What you'll get with s9 afterward isn't very big. So it's not very good. I prefer p10, closing the door to White and restoring the opportunity to connect p8 later.]

(;B[lo]C[zbuh:
This move is not very promising. o11 is more interesting in my opinion, as it shuts the door to White almost in sente (after o11 Black threatens to capture two White stones and save two of his own). Your move destroys the sente of o11.]

zbuh:
The sequence looks reasonable. As I explained above, it's normal that White can successfully invade at san san after the joseki you played. But the result is extremely good for Black: White's corner is smallish, in this sequence he ends gote, and Black has thickness so that White's stones to the left are in a desperate position and that Black's prospects in the centre are excellent.
I'm not sure how Black should continue here, but the compensation for White's corner will come almost without effort: this is the magic of thickness, all you need is to be confident.]
