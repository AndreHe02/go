C[Hello, I'm fujichan
I'm french, so, please excume me if my english is not very well :)

In advance, thanks for reviewing !
I tried to add questions or variations.

[kb\]: Hi Fujichan!  I'm American, so please excuse me if my French is poor!

You played well in the beginning and early midgame, but make three crucial strategic middlegame mistakes that cost you at least 20-25 points and allowed Black to take control of the middle.

I suggest you try and play more influence-oriented games to gain experience in winning games through power instead of territory.]

C[Playable ?

After the game, I studied this joseki, and A and B was better.
I didn't find variation with my move

[kb\]: The shape is strange.  Black playing normally is likely punishment enough, because after one of the normal variations G16 will be in a strange position.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[dh];W[ci];B[pj]C[I've often the same problem
I give a big moyo to my opponent. I work to don't do that but in this game, was so difficult for me, if you have advices ... :)

[kb\]: Normal game so far.  Try to get sente to play at the top left, because it is very big.  It is unusual to leave it that way.]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[pn];B[np];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp]C[I search the sente, I think this move is not joseki.

[kb\]: No, it's not - and Black pushing through at the bottom is probably good enough-]

(;B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[mq];B[mp];W[nc]C[[kb\]: I think playing at the top left is bigger.
Also, you may consider playing the high approach here.];B[oe]
;W[me]LB[qc:A]C[i didn't want to play at A because this moyo will be so big]
;B[oc];W[nb];B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[ke];B[ie]C[[kb\]: Oh, really!  Seems way too early.]
;W[gf]LB[id:A]C[For me, it's time to attach. I'm feeling my opponent is ahead
For me, A was so passive. Am I right ?

[kb\]: Yes, this is the correct direction.];B[ig];W[lh];B[di]
C[[kb\]: This is a very poor move, as Black can simply settle his stone by pushing through.  This move helps you fix your weakness.]
;W[cj];B[dj];W[ck];B[dk];W[dl]C[[kb\]: Overplay.  Just answer at C8.]
;B[cl];W[cm]TR[cg]C[[kb\]: Now Black is completely safe as the C13 stone can be cut off at any time.]

;B[ch];W[bh];B[bi];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai];B[bf]
(;W[kc]C[[kb\]: This is a very bad move.  What are you doing here?  You should jump into the middle, disrupting Black's moyo and weakening his middle chain.

This could be considered the 'losing move'.];B[fq]C[[kb\]: Also a poor move, as White should not respond.]
;W[dr]C[[kb\]: This is your second 'losing move' as the White stones to the left are completely secure.]
;B[ep];W[lr]TR[kc][dr]C[The last three moves by White have betrayed a greedy or jealous love for points over power and positioning. Based on these three moves alone I suggest you trying to play more influence-based games to practice "naturally" gaining points throw power.]
;B[oq];W[or];B[kr];W[mr];B[kq]C[[kb\]: Slow.]
(;W[mg]C[[kb\]: There is a better way, shown on a branch instead of L17.]
;B[ob]C[[kb\]: Slow.];W[oh]C[[kb\]: Good.];B[nh];W[ng];B[og]
;W[ni];B[ph];W[oi];B[pi];W[ne]C[[kb\]: Aji keshi - you can play this exchange when you need to.]
;B[of];W[nk];B[kg];W[lg];B[ok]
(;W[nl]TR[jj]C[Mistake for me =/

[kb\]: Yes, but not the mistake you think it is - it is a strategic mistake. (Even tactically, you forget you have a resource at K10.)

You should take the key point of J7 right now, because while O8 is big, your group is already very thick. "Use your thickness to attack."]

(;B[do];W[cp];B[im]C[[kb\]: Tedomari - the last strategic point.  Black wins.
