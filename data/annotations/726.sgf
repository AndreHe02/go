C[Hi. My name is Tim, and I am playing as  black. My estimated ranking is 18kyu, and  my opponent today was Andy, 19kyu.

We had a good game, and I have a few  questions, which I have indicated near the  moves in question.

bom: The comments that start with the tag "bom:" are made by me. I hope they can be of some value.
/Tomas Boman];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd]LB[eq:A][dj:B]MA[dh][dl]
C[I notice this a lot. My opponents often start  at 4-4, and I start at 3-4.   Is this ok? Sometimes I feel like I'm a move  or two behind because I have to complete  my corner enclosure..

bom: This is ok. After a shimari at A white has to invade around B Black can then put preassure on that stone for example from one of the marked points, or he can approach one of the white corner stones.

As you have noticed, this black opening is not a large scale moyo strategy, but rather a calm territory oriented opening. White on the other hand goes for influence, black will sooner or later be forced to invade white's moyo, and if he is uncomfortable with that, he had better choose some strategy that doesn't let white buid moyos.]
;B[eq];W[jp]LB[di:A][jd:B][pj:C][nc:D]C[bom: A black play around A looks very attractive now. After white B black can enter the right side. If white C instead, then black gets the ideal approach move at D, or perhaps B himself]

(;B[jd]C[bom: This is okay too];W[dj]C[bom: An invasion by white was the only possibility at this stage]

(;B[ce]LB[dj:A][dh:B]C[See.. here, I have both my corners enclosed  with the standard moves, but my opponent  has gained a move on me.

There is nothing wrong with that, is there?  Did I play those corner enclosing moves (E3  and C15 - letters on bottom, numbers on  right, starting from bottom left) too early?

bom: This move, C15 is too timid in my opinion. It doesn't put much preassure on white A, and it doesn't make a lot of territory. I think it would be better to play at B instead]
;W[dm]C[bom: this looks loose. It is probably better to play on the third line.]
;B[hq]LB[dm:A]C[bom: Another loose move. White A was not forcing and the right side is much bigger]
;W[iq];B[ho]LB[hp:A][ho:B]C[bom: I think A is better. B leaves white the possibility to play A himself.]
;W[hm]LB[in:A]C[Here, I feel that I was constricted. Was there  any way (at this point in the game) to break  out from this position into the centre? Or,  should I really even think about breaking  out?

To get out of the corner black could play A and keep white separated]

(;B[gn]MA[eo][fo][go][gp][fp][ep]C[I decided to be passive.

bom: This is the wrong direction, White gets thicker and black only makes a few points]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[fm]C[bom: Now white has immense power in the center and can no longer be attacked  with any succes]
;B[ch]C[bom: This is small. One line higher looks more interesting, but the right side is still bigger.]
;W[ci]LB[dh:A]C[bom: A thankyou move. Black should play A];B[eh]
;W[ei]C[bom: another thankyou move];B[fi]LB[fh:A][ci:B][ei:C]
C[From here (moves 23 to 43) I feel that I was  only lucky that I got away with this...  Obviously I should not have started like  this. Any recommendations?

bom: Simply play at A instead. To be pushed at the 8'th line should be very welcome! White is strong in this area, so you should not try to attack him. Making the forcing moves at B and C was bad play from white]
;W[fh];B[gh];W[fg];B[ej];W[di];B[eg]
(;W[fj]LB[gi:A]C[bom: should be at A instead];B[gi];W[gg];B[hh]
LB[ih:A][ii:B][hg:C]C[bom: bad shape. Better at A, B or C];W[hg]
;B[ig];W[ih];B[ii];W[jh];B[ff];W[gj];B[hi]
(;W[hj]C[bom: the alternative looks promising for white];B[hf]
C[A more experienced player would not have  let me get away with my group stuck in the  centre of all those white stones. I hope to  avoid the same mistake next time.]
;W[kf];B[nc]LB[qf:A]C[bom: This should probably have been played from the other side instead]
;W[nd];B[md];W[ne];B[oc];W[od]LB[pc:A][pe:B]C[bom: This is poor shape for white. It is better to play at A or B]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[qb];W[rc]LB[mc:A]C[Right now I feel I was doing well in  getting territory along the top (and that  upper left corner). Any comments?

bom: It looks rather good for black att this stage. A is a serious weekness that white can aim at when invading the upper side, but it looks like white needs some preparatory move to make it work. Therefore black should now invade the right side.
A few variations follow, and in all of them black seems to be ok]

(;B[pj]LB[qj:A][qk:B][qe:C]C[I thought this was a good time to attack  (invade). If I didn't do it, white would have  the whole right side. Did I wait too long  anyways?

And... any comments about the next  sequence of moves? Again, I think I was  lucky to get to move 91 with a living group.

bom: For a long time the biggest moves were on the right side, (see earlier comments).
Since there is nowhere to run to at this stage I think it would be easier to make a living group by playing on the third line instead. A or B looks best. Remember the forcing move at C if white attacks from below.]
;W[qj]MA[ph][qh][pl][ql]C[bom: This is not the way to attack. Ataching moves usually tends to strengthen both players. White want's to hit hard, so he should have picked one of the marked spots instead]

;B[ri];W[oj];B[oi];W[pi];B[ph]
(;W[pj]LB[nj:A][ni:B]C[bom: too submissive. white could have played A or B instead. After that black would have a hard time to manage his stones]
;B[qf];W[oh];B[ni];W[qh];B[qg];W[pg];B[rh];W[ph]C[bom: It is not necessary to connect, so this is too nice to black.]
;B[re];W[rd]LB[qe:A][qd:B]C[bom: bad shape. Now black gets to play A in sente too. It would have been better to play at A or B.]
;B[qe];W[pf]LB[qd:A]C[bom: white should of course connect at A here.]
;B[qd]C[];W[rb];B[pa];W[rg];B[sg];W[pe];B[sj];W[sh];B[rf];W[sf]
;B[se];W[sk];B[qq]MA[ni][oi][ok][pl]LB[jj:A]C[bom: It is bigger to enter the center at tengen. It destroys territory, and threatens to pull out the marked stones]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn];B[pr];W[or];B[qs]LB[qr:A]C[bom: better to connect firmly at A]
;W[os];B[ps]C[bom: black has bad shape now];W[rn]
(;B[sp]LB[rr:A]C[bom: I think black should play at A. White can kill now.]

(;W[qr]C[bom: this gives black the two eyes for free!];B[rr]
;W[sn]C[I have a group of stones around N11 and  just below. I assumed they were going to be  squished out, so I left them (and in fact, they  stayed out of the game until the end).   Could I have done anything with these  stones?

Instead... I played away from them hoping  something would turn later on..

bom: see comment at move 97]

;B[me];W[mf];B[jg]LB[jj:A]C[bom: Better to play at A];W[ji]

;B[kn];W[kp];B[ir];W[jr];B[ip];W[jq];B[hr];W[kg]C[Now, here, I knew I had a good chance to  expand into the middle left part of the board  with my stones at the bottom left as a base.  Should I have done so?   Instead, I protected I13 and J13... but as you  can tell in a few moves, I lost my left side...

bom: You are in a big lead now, and the only way to loose it is to loose a big group. Therefore I belive it is correct to play conservatively at this stage.]
;B[jf]LB[je:A]C[bom: This is bad shape. I would play A instead. Now white has te chance to play there himself]

(;W[en];B[eo];W[do];B[dp];W[co]
(;B[bo]LB[bp:A]C[This is a sente loosing move. better to desend to A]
;W[bn]C[This moved shattered my hopes of getting  into the left side, and I would have done the  same if the situation were reversed.   But seeing that I had a large area on the  top, it didn't concern me too much.

I guess I should have invaded earlier? Or  not at all?

bom: there were no plays in this area that were big enough to be played much earlier, and white simply got here before you.]

;B[gc];W[bm];B[fp];W[af];B[ae];W[ag];B[jo]C[Any comments about how the game has  developed?

There were quite a few misstakes from both sides, but it seems that you got away with yours(black);-)
Try to avoid bad shape, unless it is the only way to live, I noticed some empty triangles in this game, unfortunately the opponent didn't make full use of them.]
