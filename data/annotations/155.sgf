Bob- My main point of concern in this game is the opening, where I got
way behind, and the end, where I screwed up when he invaded.. Thanks!]N

I would probably complete the one of the shimaris on the bottom
instead];W[oq]C[
You should probably respond in the upper left instead. You could
pincer the E17 stone, perhaps at H17 or J17. The pincer will allow you
to make territory while attacking the E17 group, and it is a good
extention from the Q17 stone.  Black will get a thick position around
E17 and you will get territory on the side. Black's thickness won't
work well because of the pincer stone.];B[kq]C[
Good. Attack the P3 stone, while making territory on the right and
bottom. This is an example of what White should have done on the top];W

This is probably not good. It lets black make thickness around the E3
stone which works well with the L3 stone. Black needs to make another
move in this corner anyway, and you are "forcing" him to do it. Make
the shimari in the upper right instead. If black takes C4, you can
take H17, pincering the E17 stone and extending from the shimari.];B[do]
;W[co];B[dn];W[cm]C[
The farther you go in this direction, the more territory black makes. You make
two or three points for every move, while black makes four or five. Just close
off the corner with D2 or D3 and don't play around here any more.];B[cn]

Too slow. Don't push against the knights move unless you plan to cut.
The move just makes black stronger, and doesn't get you anything. You
should look at the whole board and make the biggest move when you have
sente.  I would probabl play R15. That give me several good moves next
time, no matter what black does.];B[ep];W[dq]C[
How many points is this move worth?  R15 is worth AT LEAST 12 points,
and probably a lot more.];B[dr];W[dl]C[
Still making black stronger, while getting very little in return.];B[el]

Now black has 30-40 points of secure territory on the bottom left,
while white has gained about 10-20. The game looks difficult for white
now.];W[qe];B[de];W[ce];B[dg];W[dd]C[
Too slow. K17 is VERY big after R15. The C16 stones probably can't be
killed, and D16 just makes black stronger. Again, don't push against
the knights move unless you plan to cut. Look at the whole board and
pick the biggest move.];B[ed];W[df]C[
The cut at E15 may be better.  It splits black up into two groups. You
can probably make some territory attacking one of them. Play F15 after
E15 and see what black does.];B[ef];W[ee];B[fe];W[de];B[jd];W[ff]C[
Good, but a little late. Now, black is strong on the top.];B[ge];W[lc]C
[
Taking at D14 is MUCH bigger. Black has about 30-40 points on the bottom
left, and (after D14) you have 30-40 on the left side. Black has
maybe 15 points on the top, and you have 12 in the upper left corner.
If black extends on the top, you can extend on the right side and get
about as much. Black is a little ahead, but white still has chances.
This is probably the losing move.];B[eg];W[gg]C[
Not good. Even if you escape with this stone, you will have let black
solidify his bottom territory while attacking. He gets territory, you
get nothing. You can save this stone later if it seem needed. R10 is
big right now.];B[fi];W[fj];B[gi];W[ig];B[gj];W[le];B[kc];W[pj];B[ql];W

R18 secures the corner. It will be hard for black to escape. You may
not be able to kill the Q18 stone, but R18 minimizes the damage if you
can't.];B[ob];W[mb];B[rc];W[qb];B[qc];W[rb];B[sb])
