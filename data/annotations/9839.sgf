C[TM: Hi, my name is Tom치코 and will review your game. I will review mostly for white.]

C[TM: This is strange, usualy black will just extend to the triangled position.]

;B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[bd]TR[ce]C[TM: If there was a stone at C15, black would not have it so easy.]
;W[cc];B[je];W[dm]TR[ne][nf][cg][dj][ck][en][fn]C[TM: This is one of the decisive points.

D7 is not completely wrong, but its aim is not clear. If you want to reduce your opponents influence and expand your framework (and I would recommend that), this is too far away from the F4 group. It will be cut and you will end up with a weak group, while black reduces your potential in the center. I would play E6 or maybe just F6 here.

If the aim was to invade the left side, which you do not need to do at this point, I would invade at C9, D10 or C13. You would still have a weak group, but at least you would not drive your opponent directly into your framework.

The same basic idea of reducing black while expanding can also be realized at the top, with O15 or O14. This migt be better than the E6/F6 play, because it threatens a severe invasion. Black would probably respond there and you can continue expanding.

Another think to consider is the corner. If you played elsewhere, it would still be possible to invade at C3 and get at least a ko. In the next few moves you force black to secure the corner and prevent any successful invasion.]

(;W[ck]TR[ek]C[TM: Consider playing E9 here.];B[gn];W[ne]TR[ek]
[jn][hp]SQ[ck][dm][em][en][fn][gn]C[TM: This should have been played sooner. Now there are more important things on the board. You have a weak group and black also has one. You should strenghten your group first, then atack black's group. Consider playing at one of the triangled points.]
;B[nc];W[kf]TR[ld][le]C[TM: Again, don't play here, resolve the weak groups first. But if you were to play here, maybe one of the triangled points would be better.]
;B[ke]TR[bj][ek][gl][hp]C[TM: Black should not respond here. Any of the triangled points is more important right now.]
;W[lf];B[le];W[fi]TR[ck]C[TM: This is too far and will be cut.]
;B[fr];W[hq];B[gl]C[TM: Now black makes his group stronger, while attacking the white group. This is something that both players should have been concentrating on for last ten moves or so.]
;W[il]TR[ek][in][jn]SQ[ck][dm][em][en]C[At this point I had the idea to attack this weak group in order to build up a moyo on the right side.

TM:  If you are trying to build, you should play something that would not be so easy to cut. Maybe J6 or even K6. But I would concentrate on saving my weak group fist.]

;B[fj];W[bi]C[B69 threatened to cut my group on the left off from the center, so I tried to build a base here.

[dl][ko][jp][iq]C[In retrospect, I wish I'd played H10 instead.  I think my idea was that I could still potentially kill this group and didn't want to let it connect to the upper right.

I wonder if I should have been more aggressive at trying to kill this group, or less aggressive and tried to lean on it for more territory in the center.  Or perhaps my timing was off somewhere?

TM: This problem goes back to move 34. You created a weak group and then let black to get stronger, while attacking you. Leaning on a group and expanding is generaly a good idea, but after 68 or so (triangle=critical move) you cannot really do that, because just leaning on the black group and building would kill your own group. Therefore you alternate between trying to attack and saving your own group, which leads to all sorts of shape problems (marked with squares) on both sides of the black group. Even after all these moves, it is not really clear that your group has two eyes (but the same can be said about the black group, to be fair).]

C[Was this a bad place to invade?  Any way this invasion could have succeeded?

(;W[tt];B[tt]C[TM: Black wins by 0.5, even though it is still possible to win for white, see variation on the last move.

Most of your trouble were caused by shape problems created by having an unnecessary weak group around (see my comment on move 114).

Thank you for sending the game for a review.

Have fun playing go!
