C[Dear Reviewer,

this is a league game i (1k in germany, KGS 2 dan) played recently as 1st board of our club, Overplay Würzburg. My opponent was Moin Moin Hamburg's Uwe Stolzenburg, german 2d. 6 komi, 60 Minutes, 15/5 byoyomi.

Please point out my mistakes. Thank you very much!  ^__^


Hi,

Thanks for submitting the game! Most of the comments are in the first half of the game. White got a bad result in the bottom right corner, getting no points in gote, and the situation was too quiet for white to use his thickness, so black should have tried to keep the game simple and win. White should have tried more dynamic things to stop the game being all about territory.

In the second half, black was very greedy and played lots of heavy moves trying to connect all his stones. In a long game, both players should take time to count properly and see what they need to win, rather than overplaying when they are ahead. White played well, finishing with what must have been an enjoyable kill :)

I've put in lots of variations, many without comment, but they are only ideas, not necessarily correct! If you read well, you might be able to defeat some of them.

I hope this helps. If you have any questions or comments, please email me, or just say hi on KGS (I am "sixsix").]

It's painful to give black sente; i would tenuki, even though he has the ladder breaker. You have thickness for points, so you have to play an active game.]

(;B[qj]C[this black move seems a bit slow, but i did not like black to attack my group. i decided to induce white M6 to help the group a bit

Good idea. This is a bad move from black, almost wasted. You can also just tenuki, to play on the top side.

Starting with this move, black overplays a lot instead of playing a simple game for a safe win.]

Well no, because black plays there later! It's still a good move though.]

Yes, it's good. I don't know what black is doing. He is making sabaki... on an empty part of the board!]

Why are you playing this move? You should only play these probes if you have a plan. Otherwise, it helps black plan his strategy because he knows how you're invading his corner.]

Fighting like this is good, since it gives black fewer points. White is not in too much danger, since black owes a move around Q12 and also has shape problems. White gets thick in the game, but he doesn't really get enough to make up for black's points.

This move is normally bad shape for white, since he is "peeping at a bamboo joint" (almost). Usual shape is jumping A, or maybe B to fight. 

*However* there is a special tesuji for white in this joseki that makes this move work well If you knew it already then good move! Otherwise, look in the variations to see why black can't do well here.]
