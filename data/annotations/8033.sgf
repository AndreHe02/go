C[Hi Derek,

I am Yun, and I will be reviewing your game.

My comments will be marked with a " - " in front of them. After the last move, I have also some final advice to you that I hope will prove useful.

Please feel free to email me any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
Yun];B[pd]LB[pd:1]C[I'm playing White this game, the person playing black had
reached 10k on KGS, but had not played in some time, I
guessed I was between 15k-10k, so not knowing we've
started out with even games.
I think I should be playing with 3-4 handicap stones, and
he thinks 2 is enough, so if you could give a suggestion
on that as well it would also help.
I haven't made as many notes as I could have, because I
(white) am just looking to see what area I seemed
weakest in this game.
My games with this person always seem fine until about
70-80 moves in, and then my game just collapses.];W[ep]LB[ep:2]

I suggest spreading your stones out so that they are more efficient. (see variations, which are joseki)]

Also, making center territory does not seem very plausible at this point, since you are facing black's influence on the right side, and aren't exactly strong on the left.

I suggest playing somewhere else (such as bottom right). since your white group is in no immediate danger.]

influence, not recognizing it as a ladder breaker.

- Black 71 is also very dangerous because your white wall on the left has many cutting points waiting to be taken advantage of...]
(;W[kj]C[I played this to try and give my right side some eyespace
and negate black 71, of course it's too far to help make
eyes...
I consider 72 the losong move, To juct capture and
maintain center influence, then moving on to defending
the bottom or invading on the top.

- Actually, playing around the south-eastern area of black K10 (such as L9 or L8) might be a better option than just capturing. You achieve two things: 1. you make the ladder work again 2. you are making the center black stone feel uncomfortable, as it is alone and inside your sphere of influence.]
;B[no]C[I now saw 71 as a ladder breaker, but decided to play it
out some, to try and give me eyespace on the right, and a
moyo on the bottom.

-You have the right idea of expanding your moyo while making your right side group live, but keep in mind that playing out a ladder that doesn't work leaves you with lots of cutting points. Also, you will likely be left with a live black group in the center. 

Please take a look at this famous game between Lee Sedol and Hong Chang Sik for a successful failed ladder (sounds ironic..hm..)

trying a 3-3 invasion in the top right.

(Please go to next move for final advice)];B[tt]C[-Here are some suggestions to keep in mind in your future games:

1. Try to use your stones more efficiently. Rather than only following your instinct (or your opponent), try to think of *what* your move achieves. Does it gain territory. Does it defend? Does it attack? If so, how? 

2. Learn to recognize urgent points: places that have grave consequences if not played. Urgent points often arise when a not yet alive group is about to be enclosed. "Urgent moves before big moves!"

3. Think twice before direct contacting with lone stones, as this often strengthens them.


As for handicaps, I think that you are right that black should give you about 3. It would have been a more even game.

Finally, thank you for giving me the opportunity to review your game.]
