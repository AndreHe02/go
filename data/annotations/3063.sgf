RE[W+27.5]

C[>Ok. This is my first annontated game.
>I've been playing Go for a month now, and ranked 28 kyu on IGS.

Hi, I'm Ryan...I'll be reviewing the game.  Generally speaking, I thought this game was well played by both sides for two rank beginners.  I know at 28k most games I played were much uglier. =)]
;B[pd];W[cd];B[qk]C[>Doh, I should have been playing in the corner.

yea, corner is typically better than a side play on move 3...but you end up with a chinese opening on the right so no harm done.]

(;W[dp]C[I think white should have played in the lower right corner here to keep black with an akward opening...]
;B[pq];W[nc];B[fq];W[kc]C[this move by white is a bit timid...but solid.]
;B[jq]C[better extension by black here than white move before.]
;W[po]C[> Was that a good move ?

yes it was.  it's probably the best way to mess with the bottom right corner where your sphere of influence is centered.  eventually, black should make a similar move around e/f 16/17, but never does.]

(;B[pm]C[this...is okay, but not good.  o4 is the obvious choice to me.  keep your lower side stones talking to each other, apply some pressure to the whit stone.  q7 doesn't extend your terriotry really, and white can jump out to o5 easily and threaten the bottom side.  and the attachments at p3 and r3 are still available.]

(;W[no];B[nq];W[qq];B[qp]
(;W[rq];B[qo]C[> Trying to isolate white

good.  s3 looks very odd to me...I would expect to see q4, but maybe not in this situation.]
;W[or];B[oq];W[pr]C[> S4 to prevent him to extend

I think the block at o2 is bigger...but you've got the right idea either way.]
;B[rp];W[qs]C[> Late attempt to kill that group. Don't know if it's alive yet.

it's alive.]
(;B[rr];W[sr];B[sp];W[sq]
(;B[ns]C[o2 is what you want to play here, but it's alive either way.  playing o1 is asking for pain for the o3 stones, which you find out quickly. =)]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[os]C[He lived and ended with initiative. Too bad.]
;B[ms]C[must protect n3 cut.  n1 is small endgame move for either side.]
;W[mq]C[3 dead stones, 3 more in danger. So running away to K3.]
;B[lr];W[lq];B[kr];W[qn]C[black is very unhappy at this moment.]
;B[rn];W[pn];B[qm];W[pp];B[mp];W[np]C[> N4 dead ? Trying to block his way to the center.

no, n4 is very not dead.]
(;B[nm]
(;W[of]C[this is not a good move by white.  any of the other moves here is better.  p14 doesn't really threaten anything.]

(;B[pf]C[this is an okay response by black...my instinct would be to seperate the white stones...]

(;W[oh]C[this is not so good...]
(;B[ph]C[q12 is bad.  I used to make this kind of move all the time.  look at the q14/p14 + q12/p12 shape.  remember it, and don't make it.  bad shape.  why?]

(;W[pj];B[nj]C[> O10 is a mistake. Should have played R10 (or at least to the right of Q10) to prevent invasion

I think o10 is a very good move.  this invasion is no big deal... you've got two eyes with the s7ish group, and the top right corner can easily be fixed...o10 threatens to split the q10 stone apart, and makes inroads to the center.]
;W[qg];B[pg];W[qi]
(;B[qh]C[r12 is fine.  be thinking about splitting up his stones here...the hane at p11 is too good a move not to make sometime soon.]
;W[ri];B[rh];W[og];B[pi]C[I still like p11 here, you're going in the right direction...]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[om];B[ol];W[pl];B[on];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[ml]
;W[om]C[> Now I have to kill that Q8 group or S6 will get eaten.

yes...and white is looking very dead.  black played the last few moves very well, and white should not live on the right side.]

(;B[nn];W[ql];B[rm]C[I don't see how white can live here...]
;W[rk];B[ol];W[pk];B[rl];W[qj]C[> This time I got him :)

well played =)];B[sj];W[mm]
(;B[mn]C[> Maybe M6 was better ? Still trying to keep him away from center. This leads to get my O6 group closed on its left side.

hrmm..you are thin to the top.  I think letting the o6 group getting locked in is okay, if you can lock in his corner with the k3 group...]
;W[lm]
(;B[ll]C[> Did P7 on his side do a better job ?

not sure what the question is.  P7 only works if the n6 group will be in atari., then it becomes a big ko.

more importantly...m8 is really bad shape.  you should feel the pain of making shape like this in your bones, throughout your whole body.  if it doesn't physically hurt, you haven't been punished enough for it yet :)]
;W[ln];B[mo]C[> Naively saving N5 and stupid move.

this is not so bad of a move...p7 is the bad move.];W[lp]C[So I lose initiative again]

(;B[om]C[this move...was not so good.  you need to push out at m5, make cutting points, and escape.  split white up.]
;W[kl];B[lj];W[mi];B[mj]C[> Hes trying to confuse me thinking I forgot about there ? Well that will work later :)]
;W[sl];B[sm];W[li]C[slack, slow move by white...];B[lo]C[> "Aiming" for M3

finally =)];W[ko];B[cj]C[> !! Now that i see it again, I could have got it by L4... C10 was a way to counter its influence.

ahhhh!!  you had it and lost it!  don't tennuki yet. =)  at least you played a good large move.]

C[> Should I get a joseli manual ?
> This looks messy and he can connect to L5

joseki I think you mean.  it's probably not a bad idea to maybe study the basics, but this is not exactly a joseki...]

nope, perfect extension here.  but I think you should do some cutting first]
;W[ep]

;W[dk];B[ck];W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[dj];W[kj]C[getting locked in here is not so great.  now look...white has major center influence from the bottom right, whereas in many of the variations we ran, black had that.  the difference is very distinct.]

;W[hn];B[gn];W[gm]C[> There is too much white on the top half. At that point I thought I would badly lose.
