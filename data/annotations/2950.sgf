C[Ixiah [7k\]: hello


To the reviewer:

Lately my games have tended to be very one sided.  I either win by a ton or lose very badly.  I`ve been told that I tend to overplay a position a LOT (this game being a rare exception.    Would appreciate any observations you see of that.

I`ve included a few questions in the game--mainly about where to invade, was this good, etc.

While I have looked up the joseki`s used.....any comments on choice of joseki would be very helpful.

All comments are appreciated and thanks for the review!

Reviewer: You had the disadvantage in the game during the middle game. You had a very weak group in the upper left. It needed some strengthening moves, which you didnt do. Your oponent didnt take full advantage of that weakness, but even so, you were behind most of the game. You played a very good endgame. So at the end you won. Congratulation!  If you have more questions about the game, please dont hesitate to ask me,

;B[cd];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[od];W[pg];B[dq];W[ed];B[jd]C[I thought this was logical.....a pincer and a extension.

B: The right thought! And nearly the right move. There is one problem: White can still make an ideal three point extension (by plaing H16). Therefore the move is not much of a pincer. J16 would have been very good.]
;W[ce]C[I didnt want to play low with b 15....so I did e 17 ( a move I`m not familiar with) was this a correct decision?

B: your move doesnt seem to fit to your pincer strategy. It invites a big fight, but white should have no trouble settling himself. with a pincer you would play low, settling yourself, so that the pincered stone is between strong positions. In addition as it is whites move after E17, white seems to have a fight in his favor coming up. 

I think B15 is the only move here.];B[ec];W[dd];B[dc];W[fd]
;B[cc]C[OK, white played peacefully. The result in this corner looks fair to me. But it weakens your position on the right.]
;W[fc];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[co]C[B: Good];W[jp];B[hq];W[ld]
C[This move caught me a bit by surprise.

B: because your play in the upper left corner white built so much strength there. This white move is an attempt to use that strength for an attack. Your pincer stone K16 is now pincered itself.]
;B[nf]C[B: Good!];W[ng];B[mf]C[B: N15 looks better to me. you are leaving a big defect at O15 behind. White should play N16 later on]
;W[ke];B[mg];W[nh];B[if];W[kg];B[qn]C[This was my choice for invasion.   my idea to avoid being pushed toward whites thick group.   Was there a better invasion spot?

B: It looks good as an invasion spot.  But it looks more urgent to me to do something for for your J14 stone. You shouldnt invade if you are not strong.

I would have played N12 puting more pressure on whites stones in the middle. After that H16 would have been good, to attack the three stones in the middle.]
;W[ql];B[on];W[np];B[qp]C[With white so strong I just wanted to make life.
B: That is the right plan.];W[qq];B[po];W[op];B[rp]C[B: Now you are nicely settled. white should attack your stones with J12 now.]
;W[ol];B[rq];W[qr];B[ih]C[B: After all you lived in sente in the lower right corner. And white didnt get much outer strength in return. The result is very good for you. But white could have played stronger. (Like J12 earlier on). You would have been in trouble. The problem with your move is: White K15 makes easily a base for the white stones. You should attack them by playing H16.]

;B[rm]C[B: This is an endgame move. Not good. white should ignore it and play J10. Attacking is (in most cases in the middle game) far more profitable then defending a few endgame points.]
;W[rl];B[en];W[el];B[hc];W[jc];B[ef];W[ee];B[eg];W[fb]C[B: wrong direction for white. white should attack your weak stones from the other side. (D11)]
;B[eb]C[B: Again an endgame move. Big but Gote. Attack is better (like D10, threatening to cut off the two white stones C7/E8]
;W[dh];B[bn];W[bm];B[bg];W[bh];B[ah]C[B: I am repeating myself, but white should attack (F11).]

;W[fp]C[I tried killing this invader with g 5 making two knight moves around the white stone.  Was this prudent and, if so, where did I go wrong?

B: Yes this is a white overplay. you killed the invader, so you didnt go wrong.]
