C[Hi, I am Peter loving the game of Go. For the last 3 years i
am about 12-11 kyu.
I like to hear what are my general mistakes so I can 
improve.

Saurus: Hi! I'm Saurus, 3 kyu on KGS.

I have reviewed this game for the black side.

This was a really good game to review. Most of the errors were strategical errors or conceptual mistakes, with very few or no tactical blunders. I have tried to give you general strategical considerations to consider when deciding on a move, and have tried to point out areas where I think you are missing the bigger picture.

I have marked my comments with "Saurus: ", and wherever I have offered variations on a move, I have marked [See Variation\] in my comments.

The way I have reviewed this game is from my understanding as a 3k. Perhaps a stronger player may review differently, but I have merely commented according to my understanding of the game.

Sometimes some of my comments may seem harsh. I apologize if I occasionally come accross as very harsh. This is just my style of reviewing, and no disrespect is intended.

I have also given a detailed summary of key concepts that you need to focus on at the end of the game.

Regards
Mark

Saurus: Ok...];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc]
(;B[fc]LB[ie:A]C[Peter: making a base

Saurus: This is a gross strategical error. White has invaded in YOUR sphere of influence. To play passively and defend here is just a tragedy.

Simply jump with j15. Then black will make huge territory to the left, since white cannot invade without making two separated weak groups.

[See variation\]];W[kf]
(;B[cn]LB[oq:B][qj:A]C[Peter: Here i thought of bR10, bP4 or bC6. Choose C6 because
black could maybe build a double wing on the left side.

Saurus: Hmmm... Tough choice...
B-r10 converts the top left into territory and prevents an ideal extension from r4.
B-p3 prevents white from making a shimari (corner enclosure).
B-c6 is a natural extension from c16 and a great approach to c6.

As I see it, all three options are good. However, since the white group at o16 is now alive and healthy, a top right corner invasion by white looks possible now. Therefore I probably would have played at A (B-r10). As the proverb says: "Safety first!"]
;W[dj]
(;B[ck]LB[fq:C][fp:B][cq:A][en:X]C[Peter: making base

Saurus: No!!!!! What are you doing? Why on earth would you want to allow white to surround you while you live small? Especially when there are so many other options! B-c9 is just sick.

When your opponent pincers you, the normal responses are one of the following:
- To separate the pincer stone from the corner stone by jumping out (at X)
- To invade the corner with a 3-3 invasion (at A), since the presence of the approach stone at c6 means you will finish the invasion in sente (and for that reason, 3-3 invasions are often a very good option after a pincer)
- To approach from the other side (B or C) since white has "abandoned" his corner by pincering. 

In this case, white's pincer at d10 is probably a little far from the corner stone for a jump to be effective, so I don't think X would be a great choice in this particular instance.

I think A, B and C are probably equally good. I probably would have played at B.

[See variation\]];W[cj];B[fq]C[Peter: attacking the corner stone. Found bD9 to passive.

Saurus: Yes, yes, yes!];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[co];W[ep];B[bq]
;W[em];B[dl];W[el];B[cg]LB[jp:A]C[Saurus: Stop!

The sequence at the bottom left is finished and black has sente. Did you stop to consider what your and your opponent's aims are at this stage as you should do whenever you have the opportunity of placing a stone anywhere on the board?

While theoretically c13 is a good move, there is a very, very important proverb which you should try and understand and repeat constantly to yourself when playing Go
:
"Stand further away from the board."

In other words, consider the whole board position...

Firstly, why did you play f3 if you were going to simply abandon it?

Secondly, black has a clear territorial lead. White has absolutely no territory, but has massive influence over the entire bottom right two-thirds of the board. So what is black's aim? Certainly not to make more territory in gote, while giving white a chance to exert his influence?

Black needs to limit white's influence before it gets too late. White has a super strong wall at e7, and you have but one move to negate it's power. To consider a gote territory move now is just crazy. 

You had to play at A (k4) or somewhere around there. At this vital point of the game, just about anything on the board is as good as a pass.]
;W[qh]C[Saurus: White has also missed the wood for the trees. While r12 is very good locally, a single white stone at k4 would be enough to eventually catch up all the territory that black has collected.]
(;B[iq]C[Saurus: Don't you wish you had not played a gote move at c13 now, but rather played here first so that you could now respond to r12?

Strategically, j3 is in the correct area, as I have already mentioned. However, you have invested a lot to get the top right corner, and your earlier play at p17 says that you intended to keep the corner. Giving it up now is totally inconsistent with your earlier play. Always protect your assets first before starting new investments!

Therefore, a response to r13 now was much more urgent.

[See variation\]];W[oq]C[Saurus: White is building fast...]
(;B[if]LB[qj:A]TR[de][dd][ee][ed][fe][fd][ge][gd][he][hd]C[Peter: building moyo

Saurus: Aaaarrrrrrggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another slow gote move for a few points.

What are the major issues on the board?
1. Top right corner is under attack.
2. White is threatening to take the whole right side.

A black pincer at A (r10) solves both of the two major issues with one stone! 
...and you play a slow gote move for maybe 10 points (the same size as a small monkey jump in yose). My tummy hurts.

so run into the center.

Saurus: What do you mean? The area that white is threatening to take in it's totality is marked on the board. Where in the center could white do anything? You need to play on the right. B-r10 is still a good option!

P.S. W-e13 has completely negated your j14 move, since you have lost your 10 points there too. Just shows how sick j14 was.]

(;B[kr]LB[kq:A]C[Peter: unsure what to do here..

Saurus: Simple... You are strong in the area. Simply stop L4 from connecting to anything and you will get a good result - either by killing the L4 group or by chasing it at will.

I would have played at A to stop the connection.

[See variation\]];W[lq]
(;B[io]C[Peter: run to the center?

Saurus: Getting out is always good, but here, cutting white is much, much more important and changes the result of the game.

[See variation\]

There is another important proverb:
"Cut now, think later."
That's how important cutting is in situations like this.];W[lr]

C[Saurus:

I think you played very well, and I believe that if you followed few basic strategic principles, you would jump up a few stones overnight...

1. Always be aware of your sphere of influnce (areas where you are strong - for example, the top of the board after your Chinese fuseki.) Your opponent has no right to invade what is yours. If he does so, he should be punished for it. Whenever your opponent invades YOUR sphere of influence, attack aggressively. Responding passively as you did with f17 on move 11 is a quick way to lose control of the game.

2. Always be aware of what your strengths and weakness are. When you come to a point in the game where you have come out of a sequence with sente, and have a stone to place anywhere on the board, stop, make a conscious decision to see what your and your opponent's strengths and weaknesses are, and play accordingly. Use your strengths and make sure your opponent doesn't get to use his.

3. Probably the most important concept which you need to concentrate on is to stop playing big gote territorial moves while there are urgent moves on the board!!! You did this so many times (for example move 27 - c13 and move 31 - j14) and if I had to choose one thing you did that cost you the game, it would be this. The rules for when it is the right time to play a big gote move is as follows:
The middlegame - How to choose the best move (in order of priority):
1) If there is a move that affects the base of both your and your opponent's groups simultaneously, play it before any other move.
2) If you have a weakness, fix it.
3) If your opponent has a weakness, attack it.
4) If there are no weaknesses, play on the moyo frontier, on the border of your moyo and your opponent's moyo.
5) If there is no moyo frontier, only then, play a big move on the side.

4. Never allow your opponent to connect a hanging group in the center to a living group (as you did with moves 49-L2 and 51-J5). Cut it off and kill it, or chase it arouind while making profit all around it!

While there are other smaller considerations, I think you would do well to memorize these four points and make a conscious decision to be aware of them in every game. I believe that these alone will jump you up by 5 stones or more and will certainly help you to get past the 12 kyu barrier.

I hope you enjoyed the review and that you found it useful.

Mark
