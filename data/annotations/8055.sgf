;W[od];B[lc]C[I felt this related well to my upper-left shimari.

seems ok to me but maybe M16 is better.  not sure, but i've more often seen m16]
;W[qc]C[since white has support at q4, maybe r15 or p13 better than r17 ?]
;B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[jc];B[le]C[i don't like the white move of K17 since black M15 is good, as it separates white into two unsettled groups.   this relates to previous comments.]
;W[je];B[lg];W[kf]C[This deviates from the joseki I learned on eidogo.com, and I wasn't too sure how I should handle it. Simply connecting seemed easy on White.]
;B[of]C[This felt more ambitious.

how about o17 instead of p14 ?  just an idea, as o17 protects against the m14 cut and also takes one of white's shape points.]
;W[md];B[me]C[
maybe instead of n15, connecting at m16 is better ?];W[ld];B[nd]
;W[nc];B[ne];W[kd]C[looks like black failed since he wanted to attack white but white is all connected now !]
;B[pn]C[I wasn't sure how to approach the corner, here. I get the feeling this is the wrong direction...

since black has strong position above, this seems ok.];W[pk]
;B[np]C[
this black could be ok if you have a plan that includes how to handle white poking through at p5.  if no plan for that, maybe r4 instead of o4 is better.  the plan with r4 would be for black to make a base for his stones, even if small, from which to launch possible attack on q9.]
;W[nq]C[
white answered docilely so black is redeemed perhaps undeservedly.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[qh];B[qf]C[
if black has to make an extra move at r14 in response to r12 by white, then the black position up there wasn't as strong as we thought.  the beauty of a strong position is that the opponent doesn't have big sente moves against it.

instead of black r14, black would love to play n3.  it would be worth reading whether n3 instead of r14 is supportable.]
;W[mp]C[
black gettng beat up by white now, since white both got  a viable position with r12 and got to play n4.]
;B[mq]C[my first thought about n3 is that it is not good in this position since white can capture it by going atari at o5, and assuming black answers that atari at p4, white ataris again at p3, and assuming black answers at p5, white plays atari at m3.

so, maybe instead of black n3, how about s3 which strenghtens the black position hence leading to possible attack of the q9 white position.]
;W[no];B[op];W[oq];B[oo];W[lq];B[mo];W[lp];B[nn];W[ql]C[now we can see that black has two strong positions on right side of board, but white is viable on all flanks so black's positions aren't employed.]
;B[qj];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[rh];W[pg];B[pf];W[mk];B[cn]C[I did not reply to W52 because one of my major faults as a player is pushing attacks too much, leaving me weak.]
;W[dn]C[This is obviously the right move for White, but I had no clue about how to answer it. The usual attach-and-extend joseki seemed to go along with White's plan.]
;B[fq]C[
normally when white plays d6, black answers immediately, with either d7 or d5.  d5 mostly reserved for when both ladders are good, those ladders appearing if white ataris at c5.

since black didn't play either move, white should think seriously about playing c7 himself to mute the black c7 stone.  but white sort of let black off the hook i think by answering f3 at h3.]
;W[hq]C[if white had a weak position at m3, then h3 would seem ok since it would be a simultaneous pincer on f3 and helping white's m3 position.

but in this game, white is already strong at m3, so to me h3 seems like overconcentration.  I still like c7 for white instead of h3.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[co];W[ep];B[dm];W[en];B[cq];W[dq]C[
hmmm,  did white let black off the hook ?  what if white plays c4 instead of d3.  black then has alot of cutting points to contend with.  this d3 lets black repair them.]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[cp]C[black already repaired the cuts so c4 seems unnecessary.  how about d8 instead ? or d9 ?  or even e7 ?]
;W[cl];B[dl];W[dk];B[ek];W[dj]C[
white getting a position where black was strong.  i don't think black needs to let this happen.  What about black cut at c9 instead of e9 ?]
;B[cm];W[bl];B[ch];W[ei];B[jo]C[Trying to stop White from expanding.

a reasonable idea but several things come to mind:

1) how many points do you need to prevent white from expanding ?  That helps determine how risky you need to be

2) what if white answers this move at L6 ?  Such an answers starts to look like a double attack, both atainst K5 and the black position on the right .

3) Black may want to start thinking about a profitable way to attack the Q9 white position.  if the black O6 position can be made strong enough, or is strong enough, attacking white's Q9 position is just as big as directly reducing the lower side.]
;W[ip];B[kn]C[white j4 seems very docile.

instead of black L6, what about L9 or K9 to attack white ?]
;W[li]C[
now it's hard to attack white ,  maybe black waited too long']
;B[nh];W[ni];B[oh];W[ph];B[ol];W[rg]C[Oops.];B[si];W[qg];B[sg]
;W[nj];B[rf];W[bj]C[
this seemed like a large move for black at b10.  you might think about whether some previous move should have been here instead.]
;B[eg]C[
there's something strange about this move.  for one thing, without it, black has g17 right away.  with the extra support of e13, black would like to think about aiming at h17 instead of g17, for extra profit.  but if e13 doesn't really support h17, maybe e13 is not well placed.]
;W[ji];B[gc]C[I was behind in territory, so I needed to play there, and if White took this point the game felt as good as over.

when behind in territory, look for opportunities to attack profitably.

Instead of g17, what about g11 or h11 ?];W[ao];B[an];W[bn];B[ap]
;W[am];B[bo]C[white has possible ko with a3 instead of b7.  i wonder if black a4 originally instead of a6 would be better ?

also, instead of b5, what about b7 ?  things to think about.  Author named "Hunter" has a book called monkey jump workshop , worth looking up.]
;W[bm];B[fl]C[E8 would've felt better.];W[hn];B[rb]C[
f8 is defensive, and h6 takes profit, so again, for black to keep up, black should think about attacking.  the f8 move wasn't answered directly by white above, so now black g11 looks even more juicy.

s18 doesn't attack white much, and black already seems alive in upper right so other moves seem bigger.  besides the g11 atack on whites left side position, how about s3 ?]
;W[qb];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[ar];W[ah]C[
this white move doesn't make eyes so black could still try g11 attack.]
;B[bg]C[
if black is ahead, this move is ok, but if black is behind, another approach is needed.]
;W[ge]C[this is quite large.  perhaps black at h14 instead of s2 ?]
