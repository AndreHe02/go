C[I played white in this game and felt out of control.  Even though the final score is close, and I can see yose mistake that would give me a win, I felt my opponent controlled the direction of the game.

So I would appreciate you pointing out where I let my opponent take control more than where I lost. I think the key points are after the moves 46, 62, 79 and 100.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[fc];W[df];B[kc]C[The small chinese seems odd with D3 and Q3.  But I don't think it can be punished. I don't know much about the small chinese

Comment: the opening seems very standard to me,if you don't want to let black to have the small chinese,you can play the pincers at H17,and black will probably play at O17,then white plays F16]
;W[po]C[Comment: the usual move for white is to play around R10,because the focus is at right side now.If white plays Q5, the pincers at Q8 would be great for black,invading the white stone while expanding the moyo]
;B[mp]C[I've never seen the long keima here before.  A quick search shows L4 is the most common response (!), with my R3 fairly common too.

Comment:the long keima is not from different from O4 in this situation.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[pl]C[Now N4 is perfect :-(

This feels like black gained

Comment:it's still a standard joseki,but i would rather play at R8 instead of Q8]

;B[gp]C[I'm playing this joseki from memory, I haven't experimented with it which makes me uncomfortable.  This is the first move black varies, and I think it favours white.

comment:yeah,the result favours white];W[fm];B[em];W[hp];B[hq]
;W[ho];B[iq];W[fr];B[gq];W[cp];B[gk]LB[db:C][ke:B][qf:A]C[Ok, this is the first point I was unsure what to do.

There are many big points on the board: D18, R14, K16/L15.

The urgent point is protecting H5.

I often find in games that I choose a big point instead of an urgent point and either narrowly survive and win easily (because of my big point) or die and lose by lots.  However, if I choose the urgent point I find I get behind and have to struggle.

Anyway, I decided to choose the urgent point here.];W[ko]C[As you can see, I can't bring myself to simply defend.  Is this the problem?

comment: it seems fine to me];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq];W[lp];B[kq]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[nn]C[You can see I'm still leaving a lot of bad aji behind.  O6 is a nice point but N5 and K5 both cause a little worry.

comment: I wouldn't play at O6 because it simply connects white and has no effect to the E9 black group. I would play at J9 to add pressure on black while protecting the aji at K5]
;B[fi]C[F11 feels a little slack to me.

comment:black is aiming for D12,white can play at E12 first to protect the territory]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[I've never seen this before. I think I let black gets a good local advantage.

comment: actually,black made a mistake. Q14 will only strengthen white at right side.I would rather play at Q15 first and then princers at Q11]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[pd];W[ic]C[perhaps a little deep given D14 is a little weak.

comment: white is too hasty over here. I would play at E17 first to protect the corner, after black plays F16, white can play at G14 to invade the black group and aim for J17]
;B[ge]C[I had expected F15, I was happy to see G15 because I thought the cut would cause black trouble much later.

comment: yeah,but black wuldn't follow your plan of course,:D]
;W[ie];B[jd];W[id];B[hg];W[ig];B[ih];W[hf];B[gf]C[I spent a while reading out G13.  The semeai is tight, but the bad aji of D16 means black wins it I think.

comment: H14 is not a good move,white should play at K13 first since you can play at H14 anytime]
;W[jg];B[hh];W[fg];B[gg];W[le]C[comment: this move seems very questionable to me,because it only helps black to protect the territory on top. I would rather play at K12 first and aim for N16 or even N17]
;B[md];W[og];B[ng]C[Ok, this is the sort of thing that seemed to keep going wrong in the game.

O13 highlights R13, while cutting off K13.  How do I see these moves before they appear?

comment: try to have the sense of thickness, although K12 seems very slow,but it is a very thick and safe move]

C[White lives, but suddenly black throws another bombshell, I'd missed M11 activating the cut.

comment:yes,however,it is too dangerous to give up such a big group,i would rather take the risk to play at M7]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[km];B[jn];W[jm];B[in];W[im];B[hn]
C[At this point I sat back and counted, and found I was still ahead!

comment: yes,because white gained alot on right side and left side]
;W[db]C[Probably I should H7 first

comment:this move is correct,it's the extremely big];B[eb];W[ec]
;B[ed];W[dc];B[ee];W[fb]C[I wanted E18 because I thought it would give me H18 in sente.  Obviously dealing with D15 is important]
;B[gb];W[ea];B[gc];W[hb];B[bo];W[eq];B[bm]C[B7 felt small, but ignoring it cost a lot]
;W[lb]C[In hindsight, this should perhaps be N18 and ko

comment:this is a safer move to play,white does not need to take the risk since white is already ahead]
;B[mb];W[dh];B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[rr];B[rs];W[rd];B[rc];W[se]
;B[pe];W[qg];B[ai];W[bh];B[sc]C[T17 seems a mistake.  I think white is ahead now, perhaps as much as 10 points?

comment: the game is close actually,and white will probably win by komi]
;W[sq];B[hm];W[op];B[nq];W[mk];B[la];W[ja];B[gr];W[ik];B[hl]
;W[ah]C[this move cost me the game, it should be L9.

Before playing it, I surveyed the board for a while and just could not find any good points.  P12 is one point reverse sente, G19 is a few, A3 is a few, but K10/L9 is ten or so!]
;B[bk];W[bi]C[B11 was just awful :-(

comment: B11 is very small];B[lk];W[ml]C[comment: white should play at M8 and take the last chance

comment: after 159,black is ahead, white 152 is definitely the losing move
