BL[1078];W[dc]TR[df][hc][fd]MA[cf]C[I would rather play on one of the triangles or on the square. White 6 is too defensive.  Black can simply leave the scene because he has not invested much yet while White has commited himself to defending the corner. When Black later plays on the square White has to defend again or loose the corner.]
WL[1126];B[fq]BL[1064];W[jp]LB[ip:A]C[ok, but maybe a bit too far. A looks better.]
WL[1117];B[jq]LB[fo:A][cj:B][cq:C][hp:D]C[I would only attach like that if I was in trouble. If Black wants to play in the area he plays
at A, B or maybe invades at C; maybe D would be another possibility. Afters Black 9 White has the initiative and can choose how to attack that stone.]

TR[fq]C[this only makes the connection to the marked stone easier for Black because he gets to play C.
After playing A or B Black would have to defend his cut so White gets sente and later White could attack the marked stone]

;B[kr]BL[1002];W[ko]WL[1041];B[jc]C[I would rather play at the right or left side, that seems to be bigger. Black should not woory about an attack on the marked stone as he can simply give up that stone or run into the center.]

BL[878];W[ce]LB[ch:A][dh:B][bd:C]C[this is doing exactly what Black wants. Better White attacks at A or B trying to get some influence. If White  insists on defending the corner better do it at C.]
WL[934];B[df]C[the only move]BL[834];W[ff]LB[he:A][hc:B][ej:C]

possible continuation for White.]BL[742]

BL[589];W[qg]LB[ej:A][oj:B]C[White should first press at A and then attack from the outside at B or maybe C creating a large moyo. Later on White can still invade but then the chances of the fight spilling over into his area are not that big.]

;B[md]LB[oj:A][oi:B]C[A or B is better as it cuts the main escape route and cancels some of Whites influence. The played move only defends territory. You should always strive for every move to achieve several things at the same time.]

Black should try to poke at the marked weak spots in the white wall below, that would even give the black dead group some purpose.
