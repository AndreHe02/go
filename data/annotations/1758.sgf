C[In this game, I placed too much into capturing one of two groups.
I could see that I was doomed as soon as those groups both made
two eyes.  My oponent was kind enough to continue playing with
me so I could practice analyzing my end-game moves as well.

I am black.  I lost by 37.5 points.  (ouch!)  I am exceptionally
curious how I might have made better profit out of dividing white's
groups.  I would also appreciate general comments anywhere the
reviewer sees fit.

;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[kq]C[Chinese opening.

MM: Fuseki and joseki are not my strengths, so please forgive my lack of insight here.]
;W[dj];B[fc]TR[pf][qf][pi][qi][pj][qj]C[I played stone 7 in hopes of avoiding white's potential of monopolizing
the entire upper left corner.

MM: I know little about the Chinese opening, but it seems that since you have Black, it's a bit early to adopt such a defensive posture.  Who cares if White monopolizes a corner, as long as you get the other three?  My choice here would be R14 or Q14, or near R11 (triangles), because I like having a large double-wing formation early in the game.]
;W[hc]C[MM: Since there's already a stone at D10, White's pincer looks good to me.]
;B[db]TR[fe][ge][ef][ff]SQ[cc]C[MM: Normally in a position like this, we see Black jumping toward the center (triangles), or taking the 3-3 point (square). This probably lets Black live small in the corner while White gets strong on the left and top sides - bad for Black. It seems better to keep access to the center and to keep White's two sides split apart.]
;W[fd]C[As soon as white capped me with 10, I realized I had made a mistake
by not extending.  However, I thought I would try to make the
most of my mistake, and learn as much as I could from it.

MM: Ok, you agree it would have been better to jump into the center.]
;B[cd]TR[cc]C[MM: I'm not sure about this. It seems thin. A White answer at C17 looks complicated and possibly severe. If this Black 11 is at C17 instead, I think Black is safe but small. But I don't know much joseki, so don't take my opinion as gospel.]
;W[ec]C[MM: This seems slack. Black will happily sacrifice a stone or two in exchange for a bigger corner with thickness facing the left side below.]
;B[dc];W[eb];B[de];W[ed]LB[bc:B][cc:C][df:A]C[In hindsight, I probably should have reinforced the corner with
either 'b' or 'c'.  'c' appears best to me in terms of stabilizing
and controlling the corner.

MM: Both seem ok. I prefer 'b'  at B17 even though it gives White a ko threat, because it seems to have better eyeshape.]

(;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[cb];B[bb];W[da];B[be]C[MM: Black is safe in the corner. White is safe on the upper side, but suddenly the Black at D10 looks lonely. This looks ok for Black.]
;W[dl]LB[ci:B][cm:A]TR[cn]SQ[pf][qf][pg][qg][qi][pj][qj][op]
C[At this point in the game, I decided to attack white's side group.
Perhaps I should have initiated the attack from the top left?
Doing so (such as at 'b') would have secured my top left group,
put pressure on white's left side, and likely kept initiative
for me to secure territory on the right side (which I failed
to do).

MM: The proverb says 'play away from strength.' Attacking from below at triangled C6 looks good to me. It simultaneously encloses the corner somewhat. Dual-purpose moves are Good. This also prevents White from making the C6 kakari against Black's corner. C6 is probably where White should have played instead of D8. So, a good plan for Black now is to attack from below - which also strengthens the corner in sente - then move to a big point on the right. I marked the ones that look good to me with a square.]

(;B[cm]TR[cn]C[MM: This feels too close. A contact play like this will make both groups stronger. That's ok if you're weak in this area while White is already strong -- then it doesn't hurt to make him stronger, while you get strong yourself. In this case, your goal in attacking is not to kill, but to make good shape in sente so you can be the first one to move into an empty part of the board.]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[cg]LB[nc:E][qf:D][dh:A][pj:F][qj:H][qk:G][np:I]
[op:C][fq:B]TR[ad][cf]C[Here is where I realized that I should have attacked from the
top left.  Now, my group was in danger, and white had a strong
opportunity for escape to the top.  Also, the pressure I intended
to apply with 'a' quickly became non-existent.  This would have
been a good time to explore a move at another location for more
territory.

MM: I disagree: your top left group is not in danger. You can live anytime with triangled C14 or A16. If you want sente, you can tenuki, let White attack you, then run to the center, which also splits White's groups. Attacking from below was proper. Black is in good shape, but White is not yet safe, and open at the bottom -- on both sides!  White is thin here, but Black is thick.
 As for applying pressure with 'a' - good idea, but wrong spot I think. More comments in the next node. Your proposed other locations look good, some better than others. Following the principal 'play away from strength,' the kakari at R14 'd' is my favorite.]

(;B[dh]TR[eg][bi][ci]C[MM: Ambitious, but thin. Here, you want to destroy White's base so you can harass him, making territory while he runs to the center struggling for life. Or, you want to run to the center yourself, keeping his groups split while threatening a severe invasion. This move at D12 tries to do both, but ends up doing neither. I like either of the triangles better.]
;W[ch]LB[nc:A][md:B][od:C]
(;B[nc]TR[pf][qf][pg][qg]C[I did not want white to establish complete dominance along the
top, however I realize my attack may have been too tight.  Would
I have been better off with another move?  (see trees)

MM: You shouldn't mind if White dominates a side, if you dominate another.  You don't have to win all the territory, you just have to win more than half. I prefer triangled R14 instead of this O17, because it works better with the stones you already have on the board below and to the left. On the 4th line at Q14 might be better still.]
;W[oc];B[ne];W[pf];B[kc];W[lb]C[MM: Agressive, but probably correct since Black is sandwiched between strong Whites. The center is starting to look large, and Black seems to have better access to it.]
;B[ob];W[pb];B[od];W[pc];B[kb];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa]C[MM: Good sacrifice. The only thing really wrong with this sequence is that Black ends in gote, and the upper right White corner is big.]
;B[lc]C[I now realized I had made a foothold on the top, but in doing
so I had also established a firm grip on the top right corner
for white.

MM: Right. But, you can't have it all, unless you're playing someone much weaker than you -- in which case it's unsporting to take Black. White's going to get something. In this case, I think White got more than you because you approached the corner from the wrong side. Even so, this sequence left White's top left group open at the bottom and now there's aji - possibility for future attack - in the F17 stone, so this is probably ok for Black.]
;W[fq]LB[fp:B][gp:C][hq:A]TR[fo]C[How should I have defended this attack?  This stone generated
my most consternation in the game.  Sure, I had made mistakes
earlier, but this stone led to my downfall by letting white divide
my groups when I intended to divide his.  While my infighting
is weak, I try to explore 'b' a little.  I think I like that
defense more than 'a'.

MM: 'The best defense is a good offense.' He is alone in your sphere of influence, so think 'attack' not 'defend'. You probably cannot kill, because he has room for a base on one side or the other. So you need a different goal, and I think you grasp it when you say you want to divide White's groups. Good, so you must attack in a way that unites -your- stones. Let him have 8 or 10 points in the corner or on the side, while you develop thickness facing the center. Exactly how to do that? I am not so expert, but F5 looks like a good beginning. Your 'b' at F4 is probably ok too.]

(;B[hq]C[MM: If you're going to squish him against the side, then you need to get higher than he is.]
;W[fo]C[MM: Natural.]
(;B[dr]C[MM: Well, this should defend the corner, though a White peep at C3 could be interesting. Looking at the whole board, Black still seems to have the advantage.]

(;W[dn]LB[dm:A][co:B]C[I think 'b' would have done a quicker job of securing my corner
from attack, however I was afraid that it would also leave initiative
to white, who could then move easily to divide my bottom and
right corner in his next move -- or to secure more territory
along the right side.]
(;B[dm];W[em];B[co]C[As it turns out, I chickened out and secured my corner anyway.
I then tried to attack both white groups by dividing them at
move 57.

MM: This is ok. By pushing first at D7, you created a serious weakness for White at F8. Either you will get to exploit it, or White will spend a move to cover it, which means you get sente.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[fp];B[el]C[MM: Nice, exploiting the weakness you created.]
;W[fl];B[ek];W[fn];B[ej];W[di]LB[eh:A][ei:B]C[I think 'b' would have been _much_ better than 'a'.

MM: Yes, it looks that way.]
(;B[eh];W[ei];B[gj];W[fi]
(;B[fj]TR[gk]C[MM: The next time you have a position like this, experiment with the 'bamboo joint' connection at G9. I don't know why exactly, but it often gives better results. Maybe because you're not filling in one of your own liberties then, or because it gives you flexibility in more directions.]
;W[fh]LB[gm:B][hm:A]C[I played an amateurish scenario out at 'b'.  I do not think I'm
playing out the scenario correctly.]
(;B[hm];W[bl]C[MM: This is huge. Now maybe White can live on the side.]
;B[cn];W[hn]LB[gm:A][in:B]
(;B[gm];W[hp]LB[gn:A][iq:B]C[I played my next stone out of desperation.  I mis-read E6 as
an eye for the next few stones, so I was desperate to prevent
what I thought would be the second eye.

MM: No need for desperation. Black is ahead. Especially, don't be desperate to kill. All you need is a little more than half. A move near Q10 is huge, and makes White's F6 groups almost irrelevant. Your weak stones in the center should be able to connect to the top or the right.]

(;B[gr]TR[gs]SQ[pj][fm][in][cq]C[MM: White lives with triangled G1, so why make this move? Better to fix a weak spot by playing C3, or G7 and then J6, or take a big point on the right.]

(;W[gs]LB[jr:B][is:A]C[The next stone was a mis-click.  Was intended to be K2.

MM: Misclick or not, this is small potatoes at this stage of the game. White can probably afford to tenuki if you take K2.]

(;B[is];W[jr];B[kr];W[js]
(;B[ks]TR[pj][in]C[MM: The 8 or 10 endgame points this move saves are trivial compared to something like Q10. Even H6 is bigger.]
;W[in];B[fm];W[im];B[np]TR[en]C[MM: Probably not necessary, given your thick formation. Probably better to capture the one stone that keeps your center groups separate and weak.]
;W[qq]LB[rp:C][pq:A][rq:B]C[Here, I defended my corner very poorly, and ended up giving white
the entire side.  I feel that I could have defended better, but
I would appreciate help seeing exactly how.

MM: Again, be happy to let White spend 10 or 12 moves making 3 or 4 points in the corner. Attack his stone aggressively, but in a way that confines him to a small life while you spend those 10 or 12 moves getting strength facing out.]

(;B[pq]C[MM: Natural, good so far.];W[rp];B[rq]TR[qo]C[MM: This seems kind of aggressive, maybe even unreasonable. Better to extend at R5.]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[po]C[MM: Oh, this is bad for Black. Now it is Black who is confined, and White who makes thickness facing some distant Whites. Ideal for White, horrible for Black.]

(;B[sp];W[oo]LB[qk:B][ql:A][qm:C]C[MM: Too greedy. Should cover the R7 shape point.]

(;B[ql]TR[qm]SQ[pj][qj]C[This stone was terribly placed.  I didn't see that until after
white's next couple of stones.  How would you advise that I attack
the white group at the bottom right?  Is there a clear way?  Would the stone have been better at R9?

MM: Either get close and hit the shape point at R7, or back away to R10 or Q10. I think R7 is best.]

(;B[pk]C[MM: I like S8 much better.];W[rl];B[rk];W[qk]C[yeah.

MM: Yeah.];B[no]TR[nj][mk]C[MM: Maybe the wrong direction. Probably something like N9 or O10 instead could lead your stones to either the top or the left living stones.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mn];B[fg];W[kk]TR[nh][oh][oi][pk][ol][ql][nm]
SQ[jl]C[I did not see how easily white would make two eyes on the left.

MM: Because of the weakness at circled D9, White's group on the left looks thin and killable now. Black can probably force White to have a dead shape.  However, the real issue is that White's move is huge and needs a local answer, or else White will surround the 4 weak stones and have a gigantic center + right side territory. Maybe Black should answer at or near P12. Cutting at K8 looks like a good possible follow-up.]
;B[gg]C[MM: Missing the point. May be the losing move.];W[ng]
C[MM: Getting the point.];B[mg];W[mh];B[lg];W[lh]TR[nh]C[MM: These are big moves, surrounding Black's weak stones on a grand scale. Black has been ahead until now, and still may hold the lead if he kills the weak Whites on the left. But White is making big territory in sente, and Black should resist by cutting at O12, or some similar move, to have any chance.]
;B[id];W[nf];B[mf]C[MM: Empty triangle. But it didn't seem to hurt you much this game. Most unusual.]
;W[oe];B[nd];W[ic]TR[nh]C[MM: Ouch, another big move. Still, the cut at O12 looks good.]

(;B[gi]C[MM: Wasted move. If White tries to go there, you can block at H11. E6 is better. K8 and O12 are bigger.]

it.  I'm not very good at seeing my stones until after I've placed
them.... but then that's why I'm a 20k*-and-learning.  : )

MM: I wish I could say this problem goes away as you get stronger, but that hasn't been my experience: I still put down a stone, then see why it's a mistake. But I'm not sure why this is a mistake. I guess you wrongly thought it would be sente, threatening to make B12 a false eye; or else it's just plain small.]

;B[em];W[ca]C[MM: 222 moves, White wins by 37.5.

Black led for over half the game. It seems that if you had killed that group on the left, you would have been within 3 or 4 points, or possibly even ahead.
 But the fatal problem was not letting White's C12 and G3 groups off the hook, it was letting White surround your dead P8 stones on such a huge scale. Look at the area around N10 -- it's almost 30 points.

Except for a few spots, I think Black's moves mostly are not so bad. The main problems I think I see are Black's vision of the whole board, and Black's unreasonable expectations.  Your opponent is going to get some part of the board no matter what you do. That's ok, you only need 51% to win.  But focusing on the areas your opponent claimed, you neglected to claim the empty areas that could have been yours.  Also, you tried too hard to accomplish everything at once.  Seeking efficiency is a sign of your growing strength, but sometimes you have to take things one step at a time.

These are my opinions; stronger players can show you my many mistakes... :-)

I think a few main ideas will help you. Play away from strength. Don't try too hard to kill right away. Rather, be happy to let the opponent live small while you live larger in sente. When fighting, try to push your opponent against the edge of the board, not into your prospective territory. In the fuseki especially, it's ok to lose 8 or 10 points on the 1st or 2nd lines, if it means you get to place the first stone in an empty part of the board.

Anyway, I hope this review doesn't have too many serious errors, and gives you some ideas for your next few games. If you have any questions or comments, or even corrections, please contact me.  Thanks for the opportunity to review your game!  It was fun.

Next White will save the cutting stone with E6, thus probably capturing your two stones, uniting his groups, and making a big center territory. I do not think you can afford this O4 move.
