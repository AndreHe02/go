C[Hi, Michael:

I'm SirBowen (9k on KGS) - I'll prepend my comments with "SB". I hope they're useful.]

(;B[dg]C[is this one a "good" reaction to the C15 attack?

-----
SB: Well, yes and no. It's a joseki move, so it's certainly playable. However, I don't think it's really right for this situation.

Players at our levels can't worry too much about the subtleties of choosing between joseki. I think it's good enough for us to keep one idea in mind: "How well does my response coordinate with the other stones I have on the board?"

This idea is often referred to as "direction of play".

From a direction-of-play perspective, I look on the other side of this move and see the enemy position at D4. Take a look at the variation to see an alternative that seems much better to me.]
;W[cg];B[de];W[cd];B[cc]C[SB: I would advise that you should have played D16 instead, to close the gap there.

In fact, it is a general rule that, when the opponent plays a peep against a gap, it should almost be a reflex for you to respond by closing the gap. This is doubly true in the case (like this) of a 'reinforced' peep where it's not just a single peeping stone.

This may seem overly rigid, almost to the point of turning over control to the opponent. But pushing though such a gap is a powerful move, and it's just a good rule not to allow your opponent to do that to you. You should only ignore it if you can fully read out that there's no danger there.

It's true that, in this case, you would have given your opponent more of the corner, and easy life for his group. But you could have been happy with what you gained in return, which would have been a beautiful, solid wall facing toward your upper-right position.

As it is, you give up WAY more in the next few moves than you would have by simply playing D16.]

;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nr]TR[qj][qm]C[this should be white's mistake ...

-----
SB: Not a mistake, necessarily. This (and the following sequence) can be joseki when the White wants to "swap" with Black. The "standard" sequence lets Black live in the corner while White gets a wall outside. By swapping, White got the corner position instead.

Is this what White intended? I'm not sure. It makes sense in this situation; the outside wall that White would have gotten in the usual sequence would be almost completely wasted. The wall would be facing your strong position (trianges), so he would have gotten nothing useful in exchange for you getting the corner territory.

On the other hand, if White were able to do this sort of analysis, he really shouldn't have been in that situation in the first place. He made a more basic direction-of-play mistake at move 24 (R4 should have been at Q3), which would have let him build a huge moyo along the bottom.]
;B[nq];W[op];B[mr];W[pr]C[... but i've never seen this before. what's the best response to it? do i have to sacrifice the P2 stone or it the Q3 group dead anyway?

-----
SB: You did right to capture next. The only problem comes in a few moves...]
;B[ns];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[cq]TR[or][ns][mr][nq]C[SB: You played the lower-right corner correctly up to this point, but you leave too early.

Instead of starting something new, you should notice that your triangle stones are weak, and almost surrounded by White. This makes it urgent to get space for eyes or (more likely) run the group out to the center.

Having this weak group here causes problems for you later.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[SB: White uses the same tactic again, but this time it seems even less reasonable. White should have been very happy to have the outside wall in this case, as it would have reinforced his positions along both the left side and the bottom side.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[gq];W[dr];B[cr];W[es]C[as you can see, i have tried both variations of it.]

C[can this move be defended or is H4 dead by now?

----------
SB: You netted him very nicely. The triangle group is dead.

The only thing to watch out for at this point is a move such as White L5. This would force you to spend a move to keep the triangle group dead (lest it slip the net on the next move by an atari at J5.)

Meanwhile, White would then certainly be able to kill your weak square group. This is the main reason to stabilize your weak groups before starting something else - otherwise the weakness haunts you later.]
;W[io];B[in];W[ko];B[jn];W[fo];B[mo];W[ln];B[kn]SQ[ns][or][mr]
[nq][mo]C[SB: Be careful of the type of plays you make on this move and the next several. You're not seriously threatening his group, but rather just pushing it right into your weak square group.

Your square group lived, but frankly it was luck. With only slightly better play on White's part he would have killed it (and taken all pressure off himself in the process.)]
;W[lo];B[lm];W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[nm];W[on];B[om];W[mp];B[kr]

(;W[lq]C[SB: Just so you know, check the variation on this move to see the way White should have played at this point to finish off your weak group.]
;B[lr]C[i think i shoul have played N2 or O4 here.

-----
SB: No, you did fine. This move or one at K2 are the only ways to save your stones.]
;W[mq];B[np];W[no];B[nr];W[jr]TR[br][cr][cq][dq]C[SB: This begins a very nice sequence on both sides; White makes a clever series of attacks and you defend nicely.]
;B[js];W[gs];B[hs]TR[br][cr][cq][dq]C[SB: Make sure not to just take the "obvious" answer to the opponent's moves.

This very nearly turned into disaster for you, by allowing you to get cut off when your group can't make 2 eyes. You were somewhat lucky, in that you still had some "aji" in the triangle stones (aji = potential that's left in otherwise "dead" stones").

A better play would have been at G4 - not the most obvious response, but one that securely saves all of your stones.]
;W[gp];B[fs]
(;W[gn]C[this was whites mistake i think, should have connected at F4 here

-----
SB: Yes, White not connecting now gave you a pool of nice ko threats that helped you survive the attack. But it wouldn't have made any real difference. See variation.]
;B[fp];W[ho];B[hn];W[go];B[er];W[ks];B[ds];W[is];B[eo]C[SB: Very nice move]
;W[en];B[js];W[jj]C[this is no real ko threat i think. is it?

-----
SB: I don't see it, and if White intended for it to be a threat he didn't follow up on it after you finished the ko.

White doesn't have too many ko threats right now - perhaps the best one would have been to re-take the ko at E15! If he won that ko by taking your E14 stone eventually, he probably would have done more damage to your position than what he lost at the bottom.

But he can only use that threat once - when you defend one time, it loses its punch. While you have quite a few nice ko threats at hand.]
;B[ls];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[gm];W[do]
;B[fm];W[fn];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[sf];B[sg];W[rd];B[em]C[don't know what's worth more here. defend S13-group? or attack big group in the lower left?

-----
SB: Well, as it turns out, when White didn't respond to this play, you had the lower-left group killed. Certainly if you have a guaranteed kill of a large group, go for the kill.

BUT! If you can't read out the actual sequence for killing the group, and only think that you could harass it and gain some advantage, then it's much more urgent to secure your upper-right group (by playing Q13, BTW, which defends both cutting points.)

And consider this imporant point... the sequence you played to kill the group was not the correct one! You made a small error, and only the fact that he made a counter-error kept him from making life with that group. I'll show you how in a bit...]
;W[qg];B[dn];W[eo];B[cn];W[bn]
(;B[co]C[SB: This was where you missed really killing the large group. You didn't actually cut him with this play, and instead you gave him the chance to spread upward along the side and get eye space.

See variation for the guaranteed killing move.]
(;W[bm]C[SB: White made a decent try to get some eye space, and under some circumstances this would have worked.

However, had he, instead, played the variation, he would have bought himself more of a fighting chance to save this group.]
;B[bo]C[SB: OK, now the White large group is dead, and the game is really over. You're probably 90 points ahead now, and even though he makes significant gains on you later he only narrows it down to 30 or so.

The most important comments, though, are yet to come. He should not have been able to gain 60 points on you in the 2nd half of the game.

We'll ignore your huge lead, and keep looking at the following play.]
;W[rh];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[sh]
(;B[jc]LB[ck:C][gi:B][lh:D][jc:A]C[that were the moves i thought about here. but i din't know how to evaluate them

-----
SB: This is an excellent move. Up until now, the walls on both the upper-right and upper-left were not actually securing territory - they were merely projecting influence that could be TURNED INTO territory.

A clever invasion by White might have negated a lot of that influence. This would have been a disaster, in that you spent so many moves building up the influence in the first place (and giving White territory in exchange for that influence.)

So, this one stone finally makes a reality out of the potential.

The only alternative might have been something like D, which extends from both the right-hand wall as well as the lower wall on line 7. But that's still growing your moyo, and it's now time to make secure territory and prevent an invasion.]
;W[pi]C[SB: If white had any hope of getting back in the game, it would be for a daring invasion. Perhaps somewhere around L14, planning to use his center stone as support.

But instead his play is timid, giving you just what you want - a chance to solidify your positions.]
;B[qi];W[pf];B[pe];W[of];B[oi];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[el];W[dk]
LB[an:B][ek:A];B[an]C[i think this was the wrong decesion.

-----
SB: Yes, it carries no real threat, and White didn't really need to respond. He could have had a free move.]
;W[am];B[ao];W[ek];B[nf]LB[mh:B][md:A]SQ[pf][of]C[i never know how to stop these groups from running into my terretory

-----
SB: OK, I'll tell you. The answer has two parts; two of the most important things I can try to pass along:

1) He's not in your territory!

As I've said, the walls you've built have established an area where you have strength. But it's mostly not territory yet.

2) When the enemy has weak stones in your area of strength - DON'T TOUCH THE WEAK STONES.

It's a little bit like jiu-jitsu - touching him just gives him a chance to get some leverage on you, and the right leverage can overcome strength.

Instead, attack him at a distance, using your superior position to keep him running. OK, maybe he does run away, or eek out a small living group. But neither of these gains significant territory, while in the process you've been building huge amounts of secure territory.

Better moves would be A or B.

From this point forward, he eats up a huge amount of your lead. And every bit of it results from your touching his weak stones. If you had kept your distance, the remainder of the game would have been just you making territory out of the area sketched by your huge moyo.]

C[SB: That's more like it - you didn't touch him, which cuts him off while securing territory along the right side.]
;W[lh];B[if];W[lj];B[ki]C[SB: But now you've ended up touching three of his weak stones at once...]
;W[kh];B[li];W[kj];B[ji];W[jh];B[ii]LB[jf:A]C[this was a fatal move i think. should have connected at A

-----
SB: Well, yes, but mainly this is just the sort of result that happens when you get into close-up combat in multiple directions at once. You end up losing some of your own guys to "friendly fire".

If you had defended A, he would have just come at you from the other side, with results that would have probably been just as bad.]

;B[jk];W[fl];B[ia]LB[sk:C][rn:B][bc:A]C[white underesteminates this ko-threat, isn't it?

-----
SB: Again, I'm not sure. The amount he loses is about the same as what he gains by saving his extension into your center territory. So it's not really a clear loss for him.

And, as I said, when you're so far behind at this point in the game, sometimes all you can hope for is to just try to make something happen.

That being said, White isn't going about it the right way... There are plenty of legitimate end-game moves left, and if you can make them all swing your way you can make up a lot more points than most people realize. That's where he should be putting his effort - moves like A, B or even C.]
