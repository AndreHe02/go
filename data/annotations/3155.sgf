Hello. I will try my best to give you a good review. Please keep in mind though that I am not a master at go. ;-)]

This jump comes too early. Just read what would happen, if Black pushes through at Q4. Playing N4 would have been better.]

I kind of like this move. Blocking at Q5 would lead to complicated fighting with Black having the advantage because the ladder starting with Black P5 does not work for you.

You have a nice position with respect to your stone at D4. Also R5 has a lot of potential. Even if Black invests another move (at Q5 for example) this stone is not dead yet. And after black Q5 you would have sente to play a big point.]

Looks like a good move to reduce the side. But Maybe this comes too early. I would suggest to keep building up your own positions and decide about an invasion if the board is more settled.

A shimari around E17 oer 16 is big. Don't worry about Black playing then on the right side.Black can't solidify the whole side with just one move. You could build up an even bigger framework yourself and the potential of R5 or another invasion still remains.

Try playing more constructive than destructive. If you have build up good positions it pays out later in the game.]

Very passive. Imagine a black move at R12. I think you would then end up with a weak group and R5 captured...]

The invasion turned out good for you :)

But this move is too small. You dont't need it right now to live. Living at the side and running out to the center is both possible.

So play a big move instead. For example E16];B[rd];W[sf];B[ed]

Better at C9 or D10. Depending on your strategy.];B[ck];W[bk]

yup. This is wrong. Watch your cutting points. :)];B[bl];W[aj]
;B[cm];W[em]C[----
This move is unnecessary. It does not put pressure on Black. I think you should reduce the upper side before Black is able to make too much territory there]
;B[fl];W[gm];B[gl];W[ff]C[----
Good. This pint would be great for Black, too.];B[fm];W[fn]
;B[jd];W[hm];B[hl];W[hf];B[hh];W[hd]C[----
The sequence you played here just helps Black in solidifying his territory.

Black is ahead. Maybe you should try to reduce his territory.

Some move I would try:

- monkey jump at E19. You should come out with sente and could play another reducing move

- Try an invasion at M17

- Maybe you could live with a move at S3 if you are lucky ;)]

ok. You can't allow Black to capture];B[lo];W[ko]C[?

Similar to D7. Watch your cutting points

Just play N2 if you want to play here.];B[kp];W[kq];B[jp];W[jo]
