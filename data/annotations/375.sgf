[ph]LB[jc:A][cj:B]C[bene: feasible, but not so good move. though subtle, between A and B, i think A was better.]
;B[cj];W[jc];B[hc];W[mc]LB[md:A][je:B]C[bene: feel somewhat uneasy because A feels good. maybe better if B.]
;B[md];W[ld];B[qd]LB[le:A]C[bene: inconsistent strategy. and as shown later, allowing cutting point. i recommend A.]
;W[qe];B[fq]LB[nc:A]C[bene: should keep with A. anyway, A was big in territory.]

(;W[eq]LB[jq:A][ip:B][iq:C][jp:D][hq:E][hp:F]C[bene: when there is no stone near A, this kind of strategy should be avoided. why? allowing black stabilize his group. and still aji at 3-3. i suggest pincer . possibly A thru E.]

MA[rb][mq]LB[rb:A][mq:B][qq:C][lq:D]C[HANiN : There I thought "well so what..." I guess that playing at a
        would have been enough to live, but somehow I got worried
        that white might play something like b on the lower side...
 Was that wise ? bene: i am teaching go to my girlfriend, and i am emphasizing A is vital point in this shape. there shouldn't be a little hesitation. if without it, black surely die. actually, you need not worry about B. it is not so good point. why? there are not sufficient pressure on bottom black, and  if 3-3 invasion, black can live(by ko).]

(;B[mq];W[sd]LB[rb:A]C[bene: white also missed a vital point, A. here, you can live with A (by ko). but you missed it.]

(;B[do]LB[cq:A][rb:B]C[bene: this is nothing. did you gain much influence? this was not sente. should play at B.]
;W[co];B[eo]LB[ep:A];W[rc]C[HANiN : I thought I was already dead there. bene: no, it was alive .]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[er];W[dq];B[dr];W[bq]LB[cr:A]C[bene: A is correct move for white]
;B[cr]LB[pr:A][oq:B][mn:C][ie:D][mo:E]C[bene: this was small. this is opening stage, and C2 is only a endgame play, though it is big. there are some alternatives.
black A or white B was biggest when considering solid territory. but unfortunately both players missed it. or, you can find this is moyo game. left: black, right: white. borders of each sides' influence are always good points. black C(in white's position, E) will be one example, and D another. think go like war. you cannot rescue every soldier in war. you should save only important or big group.]
;W[em];B[dm];W[dn];B[en]MA[dl]LB[dl:A]C[HANiN : I had not seen that White a caught me in a working ladder...]
;W[cm]C[HANiN : neither had white... (phew)];B[dl];W[fm]C[bene: too brave move.]
;B[hj]C[bene: due to white's questionable move, you could place an excellent move. swelling your upper territory, and attacking bottom. this kind of move must be sought.]
;W[hm];B[jm]C[bene: good spirit.];W[il];B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[ik]LB[jj:A]
[ij:B]C[bene: difficult decision here, but in general i think tight move such as B is better than looser move A.(though A also gave good results) if A, there 4 possible cutting points, but if B, 3. it is difficult to capture white group, but the goal of attack is not to kill. its aim is to utilize it. with A sequence, you could build upper influence, and still possible to attack more. see var2.]

[HANiN : in order to connect at a. Wouldn't I have been in trouble after
 White b instead of White c ? bene: if white b instead of c, then mere exchange. the size are similar, i think. no need to worry.]

;W[el];B[bl];W[bm];B[br];W[bp];B[ao];W[an];B[bo];W[ci]LB[oq:A][bd:B]C[bene: this sequence cannot succeed without black's help(mistake). keep A first, and seek variation with B.]
