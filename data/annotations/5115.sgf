C[I thought I had a slight lead but I got crushed in the endgame ... I left some comments in the game itself to explain my stategy and feelings.

csh: I respectfully disagree with your analysis. I think that you did expand more quickly than your opponent, but I think you were somewhat optimistic of your position. I will provide my analysis, and hope that it will help you.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[ic]C[csh: This extension is a little odd. It's too close.]
;W[ec]C[csh: After White bumps into Black...];B[fd]C[csh: The group becomes overconcentrated.]
;W[po]C[csh: Seems like a reasonable approach. Approaching the lower right is bigger than approaching the upper right.]
;B[pm];W[qq]C[csh: I would have jumped out, but I think making a base can be okay, too.]

csh: I don't like this move. I don't think your group is strong enough to be able to fight right here. Assuming Black connects under, what are you going to do?

See the variations.];B[or];W[op];B[nq];W[no]C[csh: This was not a good result for White. The white group doesn't have as many liberties, and now, S2 is no longer sente.]
;B[mo];W[nn];B[lp];W[pk]TR[pm]C[csh: This is the right idea, to attack the marked black stone.]
;B[qi]
(;W[ok]C[csh: This move is slow. It's generally the right idea, but when Black pushes in and attempts to connect under, White is left with little territory on the right. See the variations.]
;B[fp]C[csh: This extension is big. Black is starting to pull ahead in potential territory.]

(;W[er]C[csh: While this is a good move to keep his stone from getting a base, the black group on the right gives a lot of support to the approach move.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[fr];W[nc]C[csh: First of all, it's good that White didn't automatically connect. It wasn't the biggest move on the board.]
;B[oc]C[csh: After this move, I think White *has* to respond.]

(;W[pf]C[csh: This is a bad move.]
(;B[nd]TR[nc]C[csh: After Black plays here, there is little White can do with the marked white stone. See the variation.]

[sp][aq][bq][cq][ar][br][cr][as][bs][cs]C[csh: Already I see this as a tough game for White. There isn't an invasion in the upper right. I don't think White can invade the top, either. White might be able to reduce Black's territory there, though.

I think this would be a good time to pause and look at potential territory.

I have marked about what I think both sides will get in territory.

Black's upper right cannot be invaded. That is definitely his territory. Similarly, the white group in the lower right will make points. It cannot be killed.

Black has a lot of potential along the bottom of the board. While it isn't territory yet, I think White will have trouble trying to invade there.

The two groups in the upper left are less definite, though. White still can have problems with an invasion in the corner, especially if Black gets another move on the lefthand side. 

Black's group in the upper left isn't generating much territory, but it has the potential to connect across the top and get a lot of territory at the top of the board.

The important difference between your assessment of the game and mine iis that I think you were counting all of the lefthand side as your territory, while I don't think it is.

You do have an advantage on the left, because you have more stones, but I think it will be hard to secure territory there with one more move.

Because of this, I think White is behind.

Remember when you played the marked white stone in the lower left? Wouldn't it be better to have it at D6 now? That way, the next move could be around D10 and the game would be much closer.]

(;W[ie]C[Here i plan to make use of my thickness on the left side either to built a moyo or to make points, depending on how my opponent reacts ^_^

csh: I'm not quite sure what thickness you are referring to. White has some influence on the righthand side, but corner y group in the upper left is not really exerting influence on the top of the board.

I don't see this move expanding White's moyo, since Black F14 or so will just about cut off the stone. Black can also play around M14 to keep this stone from making a moyo with the group on the right.

I don't see how this move makes territory, either.

That being said, this move looks more like a reducing move, one that reduces Black's potential territory at the top of the board.]
;B[kd]TR[ie]C[csh: Because of White's move, Black starts to solidify the top. I think Black benefitted from the exchange of moves.]
;W[me]C[csh: This move does the same thing.];B[md]C[csh: Black takes the territory at the top. White had better get something worth the fifteen points that he let Black have.]
;W[ff]C[csh: While I can see where you are going with this, the problem is that the lefthand side is far too open to really make any territory there. Black can invade around C9 and wreck any potential White territory. I don't see a way that White can get back into the game.]

I wanted to reduce his moyo while making mine growing ^^
