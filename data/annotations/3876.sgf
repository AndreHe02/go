C[Hi, my name is Roger, and this is one of my more interesting Go games on Yahoo.

Although, I have IGN I like playing against my friends on Yahoo.



Anyways, this match in my opinion was the most evenly matched game I have had in a long time without handicaps.



I'm white in this one, and although I did lose, it was still a great game.



Thank you for reviewing my game!

T: My name is Tomas. I'm 3kyu in The Netherlands and 5 kyu on KGS. I'll mark my reviews with T:
T: If I use terms you don't know, you can look them up at senseis.xmp.net

T: The biggest problem of w seems to be that he wants to save EVERY stone and wants to capture ALL b stones. A better technique, as Go Seigen said, is: give a little, take more.
T: Although b seems to be a bit stronger on this matter, he plays very defensive and makes a lot of strange useless moves.]
;B[dp];W[qd];B[pd]LB[qe:A]C[T: Strange choice by b, which i'd personally would punish with A. w gets a better result]
;W[pe];B[od];W[pp];B[po];W[np]LB[op:A][qp:B]C[T: Again, w at A or B seems stronger, cause you get a good result without any complications]
;B[op]
(;W[oo]C[Although, I thought it was a good move, I soon realized that it can get complicated. and can probably go bad for me.  Comments?

T: It's not a bad move and it turns out well, but again, cause of b's aggresive yet not so strong approach, there's no reason to make things complicated. See var.]
;B[oq];W[pn];B[qo];W[qq]C[That i realized was pointless.];B[qp]
;W[pq]LB[nq:A]C[T: if b plays a first here, w gets captured]
;B[pr];W[nq];B[or];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[ps]C[At this point a plan came to my mind.]
;B[os];W[nr];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[qk];B[rk];W[qj]
;B[rj]
(;W[ri]LB[qi:A]C[T: I guess this is quite an import mistake cause it's quite big and you make this type of mistake often. w has set up an impressive wall and b only lives small, so i'd say w is way ahead now. 
The problem is, that there is no reason to create the cutting point at A. If w plays at A b gains only one point, while w's wall is getting even more impressive.]
;B[qi];W[rl];B[rm]LB[rh:A][pi:B]C[T: ww B is not so good, cause it leaves easy cutting points, so the importants of the q8 wall is not so big anymore. w A saves all (see var)]

(;W[pi];B[qh];W[sj];B[sl]LB[ph:A][rh:B]TR[ri][sj]C[Throughout the game you'll notice mistakes like this.  Mostly because I leave so many holes that it looks like a rat has gone through the game.



Anyways please help me in this area.

T: This doesn;t look so bad for w if he plays A now instead of B. Giving away the marked stones is very small compared to letting b out. As a general rule: If you have the chance to seal your opponent in, letting him live small, you should take it]
;W[rh];B[ph]C[T: Good move by b, this looks very bad for w now]
;W[pj];B[on]LB[no:A]C[T: Defend at A to weaken the b stone..]
;W[ns];B[nn];W[oh];B[rg]
(;W[qg]C[T: This is the first exemple of w wanting to capture everything. A general tip for w is NOT to try to capture unless you're sure it works. 

The couple of points on the side here are worth nothing compared to the chance you have to close b in. See var]
;B[pg];W[rf];B[qf];W[sg]LB[og:A]C[T: Hopelessly small compared to A]
;B[og];W[qg]C[T: w doesn't seem to see the value of his own wall, which is completely taken away in the following sequence, due to small moves like this.]
;B[nh];W[pf];B[rg];W[ng];B[oi];W[qg];B[ok];W[qe]C[T: Terrible result for w... Gained 4 points on the side, lost his powerfull wall which was worth at least 50 points, lost the q8 stones.
The main idea here is that small life on the side, is not worth anything compared to strong influence, as in some shown variations. 
The couple of points on the side has cost w 5 moves!];B[of]
C[T: good move, b takes his chance to create a wall for himself]
;W[oe];B[nf];W[mg]LB[ne:A]C[T: Invading at A is worth more then that single stone, cause you attack the upper to b stones]
;B[ne];W[pc];B[nc]LB[oc:A]C[T: b should have played A of course]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[mh]LB[dd:B][pk:A][hq:C]C[T: i don';t get the idea of this stone. w stones are very weak, and this doesn't make 'm much stronger, b has no reason to take at A, cause w stones are already dead.

This is a good time to tenuki somewhere near B or C. The move that is played makes stones that can easily be given away into stones that are more expensive to give away]
;B[pk];W[mj]C[T: Same story, b 's strong there so w's just creating a weak group for himself]
;B[mi];W[li];B[ni];W[nl];B[ol]LB[ml:A]C[T: way too defesive by b. w is very weak, so a play at A leaves no chance for w]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[nm];B[om];W[no];B[mm];W[ln];B[ml];W[lj]LB[ip:A]
C[T: instead of playing around with the weak group, this is a good oppurtunaty to cash in the o3 wall, by playing somewhere near A]
;B[jj];W[ll];B[lm];W[km];B[nk];W[kk]LB[kn:A]C[T: if you play at A instead you're making a lot of territory on the bottom. This is worth more then saving the weak group]
;B[kn];W[lo];B[jm];W[kl];B[jn];W[jh]C[T: good move.];B[ki];W[kj]
;B[ji];W[kh];B[ih];W[ii];B[ij]LB[ig:A]C[T: play A to be save. Do NOT keep trying to save EVERY stone!]
;W[hi];B[ig]
(;W[jk]LB[ik:A]TR[jm][jn][kn]C[T: Try A instead, this quite probable leads to the capture of, or at least pressure on  the marked stones, see var...]
;B[ik];W[mf]LB[ke:A][jf:B]C[T: not so good by w. If you want to get out, play as far as possible without getting cut, in this case A or B would have worked]
;B[le];W[kf];B[je];W[il];B[hk]
(;W[gk]C[T: bad move, you can't capute in a ladder if there's a hole or a block somewhere. In this case there both there so this doesn't work.
Instead w should try to keep b seperated so b has to choose between his k10 stones and his k6 stones and maybe even the j13 stones. 
See also var];B[hl];W[hm];B[gl];W[gm];B[fk];W[im];B[jl]C[At this point I really wanted my middle to live so I tried to cap some of his stones.  Twice, and I failed...miserably.

Was there a way to win the middle?

T: Best way to attack is usualy not by attaching. Try j5 here (see var)]

(;W[jo];B[ko];W[mp];B[kp];W[jp];B[io];W[kq];B[in];W[ho]C[T: b seems much stronger fighting. w keeps attaching stones, which is generally not a good idea cause it gives b the chance to attack those stones to get out]

T: g15???];C[Pass



I noticed when creating this replay that I really should be more aggressive in my defense.  I could have earned one point or two.



Anyways, thank you for sitting through this reply.



Although I didn't ask many questions I do want to know any suggestions on my style and anything on my defense or lack there of.



Thank you again for veiwing this and happy holidays.



Roger
T: How did you count without g15???


T: Some general study recommandation:

T: Try understanding the importance of a big wall and the non-importants of a small side group. You gave away a lot on the right side. Take a good look at the variation at move 36
T: Understand the size of big moves as in move 92.
T: Try not to save EVERYTHING. Try to see why the move at 76 is bad.

As for fighting. 
T: If you want to capture a group, it is generally a bad idea to attach a stone to the group unless you have read it all out. Better is to play a bit on distance. A lot of exaples exist.
T: Try the leaning attack technique. Attack one group and that way get strong to attack another. A good example of this is in the centre fight around move 113.]
