AB[pd][dp]C[B: hi, I'm Bart, I'll try to do a review for the black side.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[jd];B[pk]LB[qk:A][ql:B]C[B: good, alternative is at A or B to work even better with the lower corner stone.]
;W[dj];B[cl]LB[jp:A]C[B: playable, although you also play around A to let your stones work together.]
;W[bk];B[bl]
(;W[oc]C[Vatoreus [?\]: Thank you];B[pc];W[qh]
(;B[qi]LB[pd:A]C[B: not so good. Your previous respons A was to defend the corner. Now you suddenly play on the other side and leave te corner open, making the A stone very unhappy.]
;W[oe]LB[qe:A]C[B: to punish black, this should be around A.]
;B[pe]LB[qe:B][qf:A]C[B: or A or B];W[pf];B[qf];W[qg]
(;B[od]C[B: yes, this is a weakness for white, but first playing A makes your corner safe. After that, white still has some problems. See variation.]

[sf][rg][sg]SQ[ma][na][oa][pa][mb][nb][ob][pb][mc][nc][md][nd]
C[B: also possible. Keep in mind you're making a trade now. You give away the area with the circles for the area with the squares...]
;W[rg];B[qd]C[B: white can ignore this...];W[md]C[B: so he places a stone in your area (remember the squares a two move back?).]
;B[rd];W[sf]
(;B[ob]C[B:...and you give some more squares away. See variation.]
;W[nc];B[nb];W[mb];B[nd];W[mc];B[ma]C[B: as you see later on, this is quite small.]
;W[la];B[oa];W[na];B[qb];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rc];W[jq]C[B: white now plays a bigger move. Would be better if there was a black stone.]
;B[cc]LB[cf:A][ch:B]C[B: interesting. Good idea to invade. Around A or B is also possible, I think.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec]
(;B[bd]LB[eb:A]C[B: usual you play A first.];W[be];B[ad];W[ae]

(;B[cg]LB[bb:B][ae:A]C[B: and after A you need to play B to protect the corner. You played 4 stones there. Don't let them die in vain!

;W[ef];B[hq];W[eh];B[di];W[ei];B[dh];W[bg];B[cf]LB[lf:D][ej:C]
[qo:B][mq:A]C[B: at this point you have to try and see if your moves are big enough. Moves like A to D are big, around 10 points each. The move you play loses white around 10 points too, so probably white will respond.]
;W[ce];B[bh]C[B: but now white only loses about 5 points, so other moves shown earlier are bigger.]
;W[np]C[B: white plays a big one.]

C[B: good.];W[on];B[pn];W[nn]
(;B[om]LB[no:A]C[B: not so good. You played stone A, don't give it away so easily. See variation.]
;W[mo];B[pl]LB[lf:C][ml:A][hn:B][cq:D]C[B: no need to. Your stones are already strong there, so try to find a big move. For example A to D.]

(;B[bn]C[B: dangerous, but interesting.];W[cn]
(;B[bm]LB[bn:A]C[B: here it is better to give up stone A and go for the wall to the center. See variation.]
;W[do]LB[lf:C][fo:B][fq:A]C[B: now, white can play at A, B or C to attack you or make points...]
;B[dn]C[B: ...so it is urgent to keep white from playing any of the moves mentioned. This move doesn't help for that.]
;W[dr];B[eq];W[er];B[cm]C[B: it seems from here on, you are a bit panicking, or maybe didn't see the danger.]

;W[br]C[B: ok, so you're move after this...];B[en]LB[lf:B][ej:A]
C[B:...don't play too close to those white stones. play at A or around B is bigger.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[jj]
(;B[ng]LB[ri:A]C[B: if it is your aim to kill the white group, better start at A. See variation.]

(;B[ak]C[B: no need.];W[ek];B[el];W[fl];B[fn];W[gn];B[gm]C[B: a bit too far out.]

;W[ik];B[in];W[jn];B[kl];W[ll];B[ko]LB[jm:B][in:A]C[B: group A had 2 liberties. Group B has 3. And it is white's turn.]

;B[nl]LB[kf:A][ri:B]C[B: better A or B.];W[ri];B[rj];W[qj];B[qk]

[ai:D][ro:C][kq:B]C[B: quite impossible to invade. My comments end here. White areas A and B are very big. Black has the smaller C and D, and the corner E.

What went wrong, I think, was not keeping in mind where the interesting area's where. For instance, the way the corners were played. That gave white the chance to get a big influence to the center, which only got bigger.
Maybe look at some basic opening patterns (joseki) and especially how the areas are divided.
