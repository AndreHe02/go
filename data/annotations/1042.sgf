C[Hi there,

This is my first review for the GTL.  I certainly hope you find
some of my comments useful.  BTW, I am only 2-3 stones stronger
than you guys (I'm 1 Dan in Canada; I have an older 6k account
which I don't use much, and a newer 4K account, both on IGS),
in case you were wondering.

The comments made are more focused on White's moves (because
he requested the review and lost the game)/];B[pd];W[qp];B[cd]

you were:

1) Black played the wrong joseki but your response was also wrong.
Black was able to settle his group in sente.

2) Your strategy in handling Black's invasion at H3 was wrong.
Worse yet, Black made forcing moves and settled his group at
the same time.  The thickness you made on the right was not utilized
at all.];B[pi];W[pj];B[qi];W[oi];B[pg];W[oh];B[pf];W[og];B[of]
