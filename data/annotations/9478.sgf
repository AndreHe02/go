C[Hi, 

This is Wonodan from KGS.

I can see that you have not included your own variations or comments, so I'll just try to point out what I find important.

"My opponent (Black) gained a lot of influence and ended up with a territory that was quite large. I couldn't figure out how to invade it or when I should have changed my play to stop it getting so big. Please comment on how to reduce influence or prevent this large territory.."

My comments will start with W: in any case.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq]

[qk][ll][ml][ol][pl][lr][mr][nr][or][ls][ms][ns][os]C[W: All in all the problem of Black's moyo getting so big was that you never really tried to invade or reduce, and these are difficult to teach - one needs to experiment oneself to find what works and what does not - experience is needed for example to be able to differentiate if you should reduce or invade the potential territory of your opponent.

I hope you find this review useful, please feel free to send me any extra questions you might have to my e-mail.]
