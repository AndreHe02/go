LB[nc:B][nd:C][qh:A]C[Its better not to attach here, as it makes white stronger. You should consider a pincer around A, or maybe just B/C]
;W[pg];B[of];W[qd]
(;B[pc]LB[qc:A][qe:B]C[razmataz [9k\]: This isn't Joseki

Indeed it isn't. You can play A or B instead.];W[qc]
(;B[og]LB[qg:A]C[This is by far the worst move you played in the whole game. Reasons:
-. You are pushing from behind
-. You are giving you opponent fourth line territory
-. You are helping white protect his weakness.

Instead you can cut at A. If you dont feel confortable with the fight its better to just tenuki.]
;W[ph];B[dj]LB[cn:A]C[Good move. Its also posible to approach at A]
;W[ic]C[This looks like a handicap move... this move is wrong. Of course, he will not die, but you'll get enough compensation by building influence]

(;B[hc]C[The other side looks bigger. It may also allow you to close the corner while attacking.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[jd];B[ie];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb]
(;B[fb]LB[eb:A]C[This move is wrong. you should just extend. The cut is very bad aji. And even if it doesnt work, white can always play at A. So black is not defending any territory]
;W[je];B[if];W[ld];B[mc]
(;W[kb]LB[fc:A]C[This move is so incredibly slow. White should cut at A instead]

(;B[qb]LB[fc:B][lf:A]C[Another small move. If you feel unconfortable with your group you should jump into the center at A. This move attacks white and makes the black group stronger.
However, white will just cut at B and laugh at black. That's why black should just defend the cut]
;W[rb];B[pb];W[fc]C[Nice move by white.];B[fd];W[ec];B[ed];W[dc]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[db]LB[dd:A]C[Why give one stone away?. Blocking at A directly is just as sente, and doesn't give white such a good shape.]
;W[eb];B[dd];W[da];B[dn]C[This move should be low. Its only very rarely that this hight approach is ok. Locally, the result is very good for white. He just make way too many points.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dm];W[fp]C[White is very happy. Compare this result with the joseki starting at 3-4, high approach, attach underneath.
White has a lot more points, and black is overconcentrated.]
;B[kq];W[mq]
(;B[hq];W[gq]LB[eq:A]C[This move leaves bad aji around];B[hp]

(;W[qn]C[You are lucky white played here. Its very bad move, as it doesnt close the corner completely]
;B[gn];W[fn];B[gm];W[fm];B[fl];W[go];B[gp];W[gl];B[fk];W[ho]
;B[fq];W[hm];B[gk];W[hn];B[eq];W[ep];B[cr]C[razmataz [9k\]: I thought this exchange was worth it at the time, not sure now?
This is extraordinarly good for black. White lost 20 points in exchange for capturing 2 stones. And your mojo even got stronger. Black is leading now]
;W[cq];B[br];W[hk];B[hj]C[This is terrible. White is helping black complete his mojo. This should be an easy game for black now.]
;W[pk];B[ik];W[hl]
(;B[qq]LB[nq:A][oq:B][pr:C]C[razmataz [9k\]: Any way I can win this invasion?

Locally Its a ko (follow the secuence).
However, I can tell you that its wrong to invade here. At this time, you should count. Black is leading by a lot. You dont need to take this risk. A mild reduction should be just enough. You can try A-C, but i would just recommend A, as its the safest and should be more than enough.]

;B[lq];W[lr];B[ko];W[kr];B[jq]C[razmataz [9k\]: Lost the corner, but gaine some outside influence.

You lost the corner (made it bigger actually), lost points at the botton, and gained absolutely nothing. This result is terrible for black and white is leading again.
He has even sente!]
(;W[rq]C[You're lucky white decided to pass. This move is not needed. Your corner stones cannot live.]

;B[oj];W[pj]
(;B[ml]C[razmataz [9k\]: Knight's jump instead of one space jump?  I was treating the p10 stone lightly.

You are right to treat P10 lightly, but big moves in yose are ussually on the side, Its very hard to surround the center]

 Your group wont die because white's outside is not strong enough]

;B[lk];W[mg]C[razmataz [9k\]: should have seen this cut]
(;B[nf]C[DON'T TAKE! See variation];W[nh];B[ob];W[mb]C[razmataz [9k\]: was hoping to attack the other side to gain a forcing move, didn't work.  Any way to make two eyes there after the cut?]
;B[oa];W[qa]C[Final Comments:

Good game, you have good feeling for the fuseki. But you were way too greedy at the bottom right. Keep playing and having your games reviewed, and youll get stronger.
Finally, don't take ANYTHING that I said as absolute, I may be wrong in many things.
Hope you learned a lot.

Bye

(;B[mh];W[nf];B[nh]C[Like this your group won't die. However, Because of the result on the bottom right corner, while is leading by a lot anyway. You should resign all the same.]
