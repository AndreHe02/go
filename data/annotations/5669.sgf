;B[ej];W[ic]C[don't forget you're playing an handi game. 
it means you start with an advantage so just try to keep it.]

(;B[en]C[this stone i attacked seems pretty weak in retrospect, i think i should have responded to the last move]
;W[hq]C[i think E6 was a mistake as you said. the problem is you're trying here to capture C6 but this is not efficient : take a look at the variation.

You should defend the top left group.];B[ho];W[jp];B[jo]C[my first instinct was to play another knight's move but i didn't want to let white keep expanding towards the center, however i don't think this was a great move either]

(;W[ql];B[ol]C[second time this series of moves has happened, would another pincer here have been better? i assume there is a joseki considering how often this happens, but i really only know one joseki



it depends on the strategy you're adopting in this game : i guess you try to defend your territory in the center. 
But globally you make your opponent invasion on the sides too easy.]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[pi];B[oi]C[similar to the moves leading up to m5, this seems reasonable as it led to a lot of influence towards the center



The problem here comes earlier in the game than you think. And what happens "now" with this sequence is directly bound to the fact that you never get sente. So you're only answering your opponent moves almost during all the game.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[this time too...
And the result is that you make more difficult the way to survive on the sides. 



Don't forget : 
corners first, 
then sides
ad eventually center. 

Because corners are easier to defend, sides a little more difficult  and center is potentially under attack from  all directions.]
;W[bf];B[gh]C[i'm thinking there was a better move here, this area led to big problems later


yes definitely right. but the problem is you've let the situation go critical for you on the top left. and now you need to play very good to live. and even though you would play very good you would unconditionnally let some territory to your opponent.]
;W[rn];B[qo];W[pb];B[qc]C[Yes!
R17 is natural and good defense.
you should play this way more often (in handi games i mean).]
;W[ld]C[i hope you see the importance of sente after this little sequence both on right and top sides.]
;B[lf]C[M14 is good too...];W[bp]C[... but your opponent is always sente (that means he  
decides of the way the game goes) and he is reducing your advantage because you didn't pay enough attention to some of his groups or to your potential.]

(;B[cq];W[bq];B[cl];W[cr];B[dr];W[qb];B[ge];W[fi]C[As you can see the shape you got with G12 is very bad]
;B[gi];W[ce];B[de];W[cd];B[cc];W[bc];B[ec]C[this tiger's mouth seemed good for protecting the cut but maybe f16 would have been better as white starts expanding that direction and i had to fill it in in a few moves anyway]

(;W[fd];B[fe];W[cb];B[dc];W[dm];B[el];W[pr]
(;B[qq];W[qr]C[i don't like this shape much, i feel like i could have attacked better here

The reason is simple : you're not attacking anything here. 
definitely nothing.];B[qh]C[very good you  take sente with this.]
;W[rk];B[fb];W[ro];B[ri]C[As for me this move is very "poor" because you're not getting much.]
;W[rp]C[and as a matter of fact your opponnent doesn't feel concerned by S11.]
;B[ie]C[this is excellent it makes a lot of points.];W[rq]

;W[dg];B[di];W[eg];B[cf];W[cg]
(;B[bg]C[this feels like a waste of a move, it seems unlikely that this stone will survive

;W[hr];B[ds];W[qp];B[oo];W[op];B[tt];W[tt]C[Well to sum up : 

you have to protect corners first then sides and finally the center. 

you're playing an handi game so you start with an advantage and you must try to keep it. 

It means don't take risks and protect your terrritory when you're under attack, but globally when attcking or protecting you are too submissive or you don't defend at all. this is not interesting because it makes your opponent sente when he attacks critical areas. So this is unavoidable that he leads the game almost from the very beginning to the end. try to take sente not answering exactly all your opponent's moves.

But i might take time to find the balance between defending well and attacking so play as ofen as possible and play against people on go servers. It is better than GnuGo.
