C[philipm [11k\]: hi gg

The part of the game I don't understand is from moves 16 to 85. Before and after that section, I think I can get what's going on. I got myself into a horrible situation, but I don't know quite how it happened, other than one specific sequence where I played a crosscut that didn't work. I thought I was getting a great position in the opening, then my opponent whipped out these Lee Sedol-style moves that I had no idea how to deal with. I only won because my opponent made a series of obvious mistakes starting from move 86.

*** Hi.  I played through the game and read your comments.  I think i can give you some helpful advice that you can use to win more.

-Bill];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[Here I'm planning to go into the orthodox. The reason I took this point rather than the 3-4 is that if white chooses to play in the lower right rather than take the upper left, I'd rather have this side than the other side of the corner. I'm not sure that's in line with mainstream thinking. In any case, I like the 5-3 point.

I've heard there's a kind of trick fuseki coming out of this position, where white takes the other corner, then I approach at F3, and if white responds at C6, and I come back to K4, now if white invades at R4, I play the taisha, and it's advantageous for me. But I went for the orthodox instead.

***Don't worry about trick fuseki right now.  That's something two dans might worry about it's not going to affect your games with other 10ks.  Its more important for you right now to learn the general principles of what is a good opening than focus on tricks.]
;W[cc];B[qp]C[*** I don't like this move.  I'm sure it's fine but I like to open fast this is kind of slow.  In the course of the game this area actually comes under attack as well so doing this didn't get you much really.  I prefer putting a stone in one fo the major areas still not spoken for. K3, J4, C10...]
;W[ed]C[I don't see why white is going for this kind of formation. If we're both building big frameworks, I'll always be a move ahead.

***You'll always be a move ahead no matter what he does.  this is a pretty standard way to develop a 3-3, but again, I think a move like K 16 attacking an unclaimed area makes more sense for white.]
;B[cn]C[I decided to disrupt white's development here, rather then take Q10 right away. I'm confident I'll either have time to come back and play Q10, or if not, I'll get something even more valuable on this side.]
;W[co]C[I wasn't expecting this one.];B[dn];W[cq]C[I thought this was way too small. Yes, if white takes F4, there's still aji in the corner, but I'm not going to use that aji right away.

***Yes this is too small.  Usual is F3];B[cj]C[*** Good move taking advantage of your opponent's small move.]
;W[jq]LB[nc:B][ch:A]C[I thought this was the wrong direction. First: white's enclosure in the top left is losing value. Second: I'm threatening to build something big on the right. Third: the bottom isn't super developable for white anyhow. If white was going to ignore my development on the right, I would've at least expected A or B instead.

*** The move just seems ineffective to me.  right now it looks like black can play Q10 and no matter how white reacts he's going to be down a lot of points.  He probably should have made a move like R10 after which K16 and K4 areas are pretty much Miai.  He should try to get K4 if he can but if Black plays there he can take K16.

Here Black should play around Q10 and if white answers at say, K17,  there are a lot of ways to attack based on the K3 stone being easily cut and really not having any friendly stones to help it.]
;B[pj];W[qf]C[Again, I think white is approaching from the wrong direction.

***White is already hurting and looks like he wants to fight and hope for the best.]
;B[qe];W[of]C[I'd never seen this move before. I know it's not the standard response.

***It's very common.];B[nd];W[qj]LB[qk:A]C[I don't know if this attachment was good or bad. It seems I can cut this stone off, so if white wanted to attach to my stone, maybe Q11 would've been better?

*** A play at A for Black here is probably better direction.  if he extends toward his other stones with R-!! you Play Q9 and your lower corner is getting massive while he has a really fishy group tightly surrounded.]
;B[qi]C[I'm wondering if hane on the other side would've lead to a better result. Maybe this was an overplay, and if so, I blame it on being overconfident due to disagreeing with nearly all of white's moves up to this point.]
;W[qk];B[pi]C[In any case, I'm happy with this result. White now has two weak groups compared to my one.]
;W[pk];B[ni]C[I'm looking at this now and wondering if it was too slow.

*** No. it's a move that strongly limits the options of both weak white groups while increasing the prospects of your own weakish group.  I'd say it's pretty efficient.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[pf]
(;B[qd]LB[re:A][nf:B]C[***In this fight I like the decent better than the r16 connection.  I would also strongly consider playing B (Variation given).]
;W[ne];B[od];W[ng]C[I figure white's group on the top is now strong enough that I don't have any good threats against it. Maybe N15 would be all right, but I thought white might be able to ignore that, so I played elsewhere.]
;B[qm];W[qn]C[I was surprised by this move. Maybe R7 was too close for me to play? But I doubt it. I thought it would be ridiculous for white to make three weak groups.]
;B[pn];W[qo]
(;B[pm]C[I think this was a mistake (see variation)

***It's interesting.  The way I look at this you've told white he can have the lower corner but, you're going to absolutely win the Q 9 stones, shut white into that corner, and probably make him take gote.]
;W[po]LB[oo:A]C[*** I think A is the right move for Black.]

(;B[pp]C[*** this still isn't terrible, it's just messy now and I like to avoid messy in areas where I'm strong.]
;W[oo];B[nm];W[nk];B[li];W[mk];B[mn]C[I have hardly any experience with running battles, so I don't know if any of these moves are good.

*** So far good.  You want to look for moves that help one of your groups while hurting 2 or more of his.  so far you're doing that.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[nn]LB[on:A]C[And at this point I figure I've made a mistake somewhere.

***possibly not, but you are about to.  You've got to stop him connecting these groups here.]

(;B[rp]TR[pm][qm][pn]C[A last-ditch effort to save my stones. I looked at connecting at N7, but I thought it would be too slow.

***your stones looked fine to me.];W[mm];B[rm]C[And still not connected, but I think it's good to at least have this point to prevent white from connecting immediately, and perhaps save my weak group above.]
;W[om]C[I was sure white would play S5 or S6 instead. I wasn't planning on this connection actually working.]
;B[ln]C[Maybe I was pushing my luck here, but I figured that if white isn't interested in disrupting that connection, I can prevent white from getting too much strength in this area.]
;W[mp];B[lm]C[Again, pushing my luck...];W[nl];B[rn]C[And with no more forcing moves in that area, I'm done gambling.]
;W[ro]C[Maybe white thought I couldn't make the connection anyhow? I don't see any reason for white to play here right away. This would've been a good ko threat in the future ko that would've been huge but wasn't played out...]
;B[so];W[lp]TR[kk]C[This does guarantee a connection for white, but I think a move around the triangle would've been a lot more threatening for me.]
;B[hc]C[But during the game I wasn't thinking about that area either. I was probably obsessing too much about punishing white's questionable fuseki.

Was this extension too far? White seemed to think so, given that there was an immediate invasion.

*** yes too far. K16 was a great extension to put pressure on O15 as well as gaining points.  if white tries to invade O15 probably dies on a huge scale.]
;W[jc];B[je]
(;W[kd]TR[id]C[Why didn't white just split my shape?];B[ke]
C[This is the move I regret. I should've read that the crosscut didn't work...

*** yes just M15 pretty much kills O15 which was the more important idea.]
;W[le];B[ld]C[And here we go.];W[md];B[lc];W[mc];B[lf];W[me]
;B[lb];W[mb]C[I'm seeing trouble now, but I figure I can connect...]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[jb];W[kb]C[And it wasn't until here that I saw I had a liberty shortage.

Yeah that's big.];B[jd];W[kc];B[ob]C[I decided not to take the forcing move at J17 as well, since I figured it wouldn't get me much. As it happened, I'm glad I didn't take it now...]
;W[oa];B[pa];W[nb];B[na];W[ib];B[ic]C[Now I figure this move will get me H18 in sente, so I take it.]
;W[hb]C[!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I couldn't believe it.

From this point, things are straightforward enough that I've been able to review the rest of the game by myself, and have a decent understanding of what's happening.

*** Well, that's go.  It's usually not our well thought out and conceived plan that makes the difference.  One or the other just plays a REALLY bad move.]
;B[ka];W[lg]
(;B[mh];W[mg];B[kf]C[L13 is a common tesuji here. he tkeas the stones, you play K13 locking him in.  He still hasn't got an eye there until he takes one in gote and that might let you kill him since he doesnt have a lot of other prospects for eyes.

Now he's out and your stones at Q 11 are strongly threatened.]
;W[kg];B[jg];W[ki];B[kh]
(;W[oi];B[oj];W[oh];B[nj];W[jh];B[lh];W[jj]TR[kj]C[Why wouldn't white just play there instead? It also takes care of the double atari. If white wanted to turn this into a capturing race, which is what I think white was trying to do, that would've been the move...

***I agree that would be a better try.]
(;B[rf]C[Here I'm still assuming this is going to turn into a capturing race, and I'm really worried about this point. Also, I'm holding out some hope that white will let me connect. And I think I would've played here even if I had looked at L10 (see variation)]

(;W[rg];B[re];W[qh];B[ph]LB[ri:A]C[Must prevent an eye...

***But let him connect under?]
(;W[pg];B[nh]C[Still bent on preventing an eye...];W[og]C[I was happy to see this move, since it meant that even if I wasn't sure what was going on, my opponent wasn't either.]
;B[rh]C[Now I'm expecting a giant ko. I plan on ignoring any and all threats, since capturing at T13 would just solve every one of the problems I currently have. M6 is going to come under a huge attack, and I might still lose if that group dies, but I'm not thinking about that now.]
;W[ri];B[qg];W[sg]C[I thought this was a nifty idea, even if it didn't work.]

(;B[rj]C[I think this was a slight mistake (see variation)]
;W[qh];B[si];W[qg]C[???

***doesn't matter.  He sees now that he's lost this fight.]

(;B[kj]C[Now I'm trying to get M6 to safety, and take some forcing moves away from white]
;W[ji];B[lj];W[kk];B[lk];W[ll];B[kl]C[Ko #2 that wasn't played out...]
;W[jk];B[ml];W[jl]C[ok];B[ll];W[jm];B[rk]LB[cg:A][ig:D][ej:B]
[jo:C]C[I'm not sure why, but I felt like I wanted this connection anyhow. Something on the left would've probably been better.

***yeah playing extra moves in a fight that's already won or lost is a huge hole in the game of just about every Kyu player.  You'll want to discipline yourself to make tenukis when you can't find a real threat that needs defending against.

I struggle with this at times as a 3k.];W[ol]C[philipm [11k\]: gg thx

White played this move, thought for a bit, and resigned.

*** GG indeed!  What to take away from this...a few ideas will help you going foward:

1) the playing extra moves in a fight that's over, covered that, every time you do it you lose the opportunity to play a big, meaningful move somewhere else and give your opponent control of the game.

2) when you fight keep in mind that it's not always about making eyes.  It's about making points.  A lot of times a move that puts gentle pressure on a weak group while making points is better than a severe attack that leads to an unclear result.

3) don't worry too much about your fighting mistakes, you'll get better at that with time and practice.  Watching high dan games online is a great way to see common patterns and how they tend to play out.  solving probelms is good too if you enjoy it.

Thanks for submitting your game for review!])

(;B[qh];W[sh];B[sf];W[si];B[rj]C[I could've done this, right? In hindsight, this would've been a somewhat better result for me, since now my dumb group is finally connected. But since I'd win a capturing race anyhow (or so I believe,) that connection isn't so important anymore.]
