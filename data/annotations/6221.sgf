AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Ekberg: I think my fear of contact play is my largest weakness, and I will be grateful if you point out a few variations showing how I could have fought better, especially against the disastrous invasions on the upper half of the board.
You shouldn't use a lot of time on minor mistakes or the obviously bad moves that I have marked as bad!

C: Hi. I will mark my comment by starting them with "C:". 

There are two main opportunities for improving your game that I found here:

1. a tendency to play poor shape moves (consider "Shape Up" by Charles Matthew, I believe it is on gobase, or try to play through some professional games)
2. a tendency to focus on minor tactical situations that had no real strategic or territorial value, or put another way, a tendency to follow your opponent around rather than looking for opportunities to tenuki and play big points.

You also have a tendency to over-value your thickness and seem unwilling to let white get anything (and as a consequence you overplay and end up with nothing). When white invades your moyo's you need to accept that white will probably live but you must be able to get compensation elsewhere in terms of territory or thickness.

Also, when your opponent invades your territory, consider capping moves or other enclosing moves, attachments usually give your opponent something to work with.

Although it didn't matter in this particular game, your endgame was good, and that will be important in closer games.]
;W[jj]C[Ekberg: Should I play close to this to reduce its influence?

C: You already have plenty of influence with the 4 star stones. You should just remember that while white takes a territorial loss, he now gets to win most ladders and has help for his fights.]
;B[pj]C[C: This is fine];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[gq]C[C: This is a vague move - it cannot secure the corner, and in terms of reducing white's options to expand on the bottom, F3 is better because it has a more secure connection to D4. K16 is also a nice move here.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[bp];B[bo];W[ap]
(;B[ao]C[C: I would prefer to leave this alone, and save it as a threat later on. C6 is a better shape move (although there is the cutting point to worry about).]
;W[br]C[C: You've now forced white to live and lost most of the aji in the corner, and still ended in gote.]
;B[ep]C[C: you still have a weakness at C5];W[bf];B[jd]C[Ekberg: A pincer would be better, huh?

C: Definitely. Something around c10 attacks white and starts taking territory.]
;W[ci];B[ck];W[cc]
(;B[dc]C[C: correct - the other direction does not work, see variation.]
;W[cd]
(;B[ce]C[C: This is not good shape - you leave a cutting point, and you force white to connect. D15  is better.]
;W[be];B[df];W[gd]C[Ekberg: now this looks to me as an overplay (too close to my thickness), but my attempts to punish it failed miserably. Please tell me what to do!

C: This is a good move from white. Your thickness is not as thick as you may think, because of the weakness at D15 and the large number of surrounding white stones. Also, white has invaded high, and it will be difficult to kill, especially with the support at tengen (K10). You do not want white to separate your stones. It is hard to find a suitable move here. Perhaps connecting underneath is best.]

(;B[gf]LB[ff:C][hf:A][if:B]C[Ekberg: I guess A or B might be better, but then white could escape at C?

C: Its very difficult - your stones at D17 are weak.];W[ie]

(;B[je]C[C: Perhaps cut immediately? See variation.];W[hf]
(;B[hg]C[C: Try not to give white options to make sabaki - white will be looking to crosscut, attach and sacrifice. G15 looks like a nice move here.]
;W[gg]
(;B[if]C[C: Always at least consider an extension after a crosscut, the atari very seldom works. See variation.]
;W[he];B[ig];W[ff]C[C: You have obtained some nice thickness in compensation for the invasion, unfortunately you have pretty much lost your D17 stones. Its probably best to leave them now and hopefully use their aji later.]
;B[gh]C[C: After this your group on the left is basically dead.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[eg];B[ic]C[C: This is a difficult move. It is aji-keshi (reducing the aji of the D17 stones), but it is sente, so long as you follow it up with a big move.]
;W[gc]C[Ekberg: I might have done something like jigo, if I could save my top left group. Is it dead now, or is there still some way to rescue it?

C: dead];B[hd]MA[qf][pf][mc][md][nd][nc]C[C: Consider a big move. Force white to invade.]
;W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[cb];W[bb];B[bc];W[bd];B[ba];W[ac];B[eb]
;W[ee]
(;B[de]LB[da:A][fa:C][ha:D][ab:B][fb:E]C[Ekberg: this is of course stupid. 'A' would give one eye, but the other eye seems impossible, unless I can win a ko on B (which I can't, but then at least white must ignore some ko threat of mine). C would threaten to connect, but after white D, A and E are miai to kill.
Please correct my miscalculations!

C: As you can see in my variations, there is no ko, and the group is dead as it stands]
;W[da];B[dg];W[eh];B[ch];W[bh];B[di];W[dh];B[cg];W[bi]
(;B[cj]C[Ekberg: stupid move again

C: of course you are upset at losing that group, but you still have a lot of potential territory on the right and top side. You still have a chance.]
;W[ei];B[fj]LB[gk:A]C[Ekberg: Would something like A be better to stop W's agression?

C: I'm not sure what your goal is here. If you are trying to protect the territory on the left, then something like E9 is better.  If you are trying to protect cutting points, then rather connect them. I suspect you are trying to prevent white connecting to his other stones, but I believe now is a time to play some big moves.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[dk];W[gj];B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[fi]C[C: white should just extend to E8]
;B[fl];W[hk]MA[nc][nd][md][qf][pf]C[C: OK, at this point its worth doing a count. White has gotten about 50 points on the top left, and about 5 on the bottom left. Black can get perhaps 20 points from the group on the left, which means black needs to get 35+ points from the top right and right hand side corner, while preventing white from getting any meaningful territory in the middle. 

Black's wall is reasonably strong, and black should definitely be thinking about trying to claim some sizable territory now. Moves like J10 achieve nothing, instead consider moves like the ones marked X. Of course white will invade, that will however give the chance to secure the territory on the other side of the invasion. So long as the black K16 does not die, then there is a good chance of catching up.]
;B[ii]C[C: The H10 stones are no important at this stage, your moves are little better than passing. Big moves are needed!]
;W[ji];B[jh];W[hh];B[ih]C[C: This is a common DDK error, once you realize that its not necessary and that you can play elsewhere,  you will improve.]
;W[fn]
(;B[gl];W[hn];B[ng]LB[en:A]C[Ekberg: I guess something like A was more urgent. But to claim the upper right corner, what would be correct? A block against the 3-3 invasion?

C: Something around here has been urgent for about 20 moves, fortunately white let you play first. The problem with O13 is that it gives white a lot of space to invade underneath, and is probably too close to your thickness. I've commented earlier on some suggested moves.]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[pg]
(;B[ph]C[C: Cut!];W[lg]C[Ekberg: How to stop this invasion/reduction?

C: This is possibly too deep, however your O13 stone is quite weak, so this is a reasonable move from white. I don't think you "stop" it, all you can do is try to get some compensation out of it.

I show some variations where you may end up with an attack on white, but the weakness in your wall at K14 is a problem. There are also possibilities to take some territory, but white always has R17]
