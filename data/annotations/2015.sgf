C[I'm at a begginner level, don't really know my rank (maybe you could give me an estimate after looking at the game). I guess the big mistake about this match was not connecting the two main groups and not invading when I should, and playing too defensively ([cowardly?\]). Any advice, comment or correction is accepted. Thanks a lot for your time.

I played with the white stones on this game.

I'm andre, about 14k in strength, i'll do my best in reviewing your game. I've already take a quick look. it seems that black player is not 30k in strength. Probably 26k. My english is not quite good, hope you can understand.

Basic principle :
- At opening sequence, always play for big points
- Don't make early territory
- Don't touch your opponent's stone unless your group is weak
- Touch fight will make both side stronger
- GO is a game about searching/identifying/playing big points and vital points
- Don't create a huge single sided wall, build the other sides too to create large moyo
- During end games, don't play on dame points. But ensure connections
- Don't play endgame moves during midgame

My suggestion for you to improve yourself :
- Learn all basics first (fuseki, joseki, live&death)
- Learn basic principle (you can learn his from GTL's review and Wings GO Club's review)
- Play as many as you can and get reviewed, learn from your mistakes
- Don't be afraid to experiment new moves, the fun of go resides on trying new moves
- Best players is not the one that never makes mistakes but ones that learn from his and others' mistakes

Hope this helps,

Hoshi point is flexible, a stone at it can invade to centre, side and secure corner. Its negative side is that it is weaker than other points. A double attack at hoshi point weaken that point badly. I'll give you an example.]
;B[fc]
(;W[dc]C[was that protective move too premature?

Yes, and it is small. see variation.];B[ic];W[ej]SQ[qm][pn]
[qn][np][mq][nq]C[Instead this move, i recommend attacking Black's corner position to gain better position. Either one of the position marked square is fine.]
;B[fq];W[hp]TR[jq][kq]SQ[cm][pn][nq]C[Was K3/L3 better in this move?

It depends wether you need influence or territory, a move at line 4 means you take influence over territory and a move at line 3 has the opposite meaning

I myself prefer L3 in this situation. You have so little territory compared to black.
Or a move at C7 to defend your corner and attack Q4 at O3 or Q6]
;B[fo]
(;W[fp]SQ[dn]C[That cut on F4 was never going to work, right?

Don't touch opponent's stone unless your group is weak, D6 is better.]

(;B[dq]SQ[cq]C[This move is weak, see variation.

Instead, it is better to advance to C3.]

(;W[bq]SQ[hr]C[This move is small, it looks like black is abandonining his small left area to advance to bottom right area, I recommend placing the stone H2 (32 points worth).]
;B[hq]
(;W[go]LB[gp:A]C[was that a good move? or should have been better to secure the group at A?

A move at G5 is to challenge your opponent  to a ko fight but in this case your position is weak, you should play at A]
;B[iq];W[ip];B[jq]C[I gues by this point I should have started playing in the right area (like  Q10 or Q11)]
;W[kp];B[no]
(;W[lq];B[qq];W[kq]C[This move is over protective and useless, K4 is better to make connection between groups and shut black group so he cannot advance to centre]

;B[mc]C[Now B has almost the whole upper area  :(

not yet!! see next comment and watch the variation]
(;W[or]SQ[pr]C[Too small, Q2 is fine.
 But instead, how about attacking upper area to secure a huge moyo ?
you already has a wall at bottom area altough not quite strong but can be fortified later]
;B[pr]
(;W[ps]SQ[fe]C[This move usually occurs at endgame sequence, too small to play now. Your opponent can tenuki to play for bigger points, and the worst side is that you lost sente. You can play at F15 to secure centre area]
;B[qs];W[os];B[oq];W[mr];B[qk]TR[qf]SQ[pi]C[This move is small too, he should play at around R11 to secure more area and to defend an attack at R14]

(;W[ef]LB[gf:A][gg:B]C[Was it too risky to play at A or B to have a bigger moyo?

Yes, a position at either A or B is too weak. Black can cut.]
;B[gf];W[eh];B[gh]
(;W[ce]C[was that move too small/defensive?

What is the purpose of this move ? Black is making a wall to take middle area, but currently the wall has not yet finished  Your current position is weak, but there is still a chance to take some area on the middle.]

Why do tjese group needs connection ?
Only weak groups need connection, these group already has base

You should concentrate on destroying black's large moyo at centre]

(;W[dg]C[What's this move's purpose ?

If you need defense, try attacking and gain shape points by kikashi]

Dumb move.

Think with clear head, which move can exploit big points, I myself prefer invading at R17]

Instead of this move, how about making a move at A2 ? (4 points worth)
M4 (1 point)
L7 (1 point)
C5 (1 point)];B[qg]C[This is a paranoid move by black

white cannot attack and make eyes there if attacked properly]
;W[pi]C[By this time that I lost so much presence in the center/right area, is there any chance to keep on playing to gain some territory, or is the game considered to be lost already?

Unless black makes mistakes, the games can be considered lost already, this move should be played during fuseki, it's to late to play it now
