C[I played against an opponent of or equal lesser skill on the KGS. Originally I expected a close game or a close win on my part, but this game was anything but close for me.
   I would appreciate any comments you have regarding my play, a vital move that was missed by both, and feel free to point out anything I missed.
***Thank you for your time***



Hi Andrew,

This game was a great game to review, because the mistakes illustrated a couple of important concepts for growing stronger in go

1) Attack weak groups
2) Profit when groups that enter your area of influence. 
3) Expand your potential at the expense of your opponents.


My comments are preceeded with NS

Please let me know if you have any questions about my terminology, concepts, etc, and good luck!]

C[NS: Good move.];W[qj]C[seems really weird that he would play this move looks more a random side extension, I am unfamiliar corner approaches on stones that are on the third line.

NS: An odd move.  Could consider  tenuki.  I would probably respond with R3]

(;B[oq]C[in retrospect I really didn't like this move at all and also  looking back it seems that he placed that other stone out there with the intention of escaping and making a good chunk of side and corner territory.

NS:I don't think this is a very good choice of joseki, especially with C4.  Typically you play R3. (see variation)]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn]C[I think the  extension is ok, but  I think you should play q7 first.]

(;B[jp]C[I believe I should have protected my stones before I played like this but, in the end it did well for making territory.

NS: This is Ok, but Q7 first, see variation.];W[or];B[nr];W[pr]
;B[np]C[NS: Odd shape.  Perhaps n3.];W[pm]C[Big move.];B[eq]
C[I really don't know if there is anything to be asked on this move. It looks nice, anything wrong with it?

NS: This is a fine move.];W[ep];B[fp]C[NS: See variation.];W[eo]

(;B[hq]C[NS: So by playing this move, you allow W to get some good forcing moves beginning at D3.  This move should be at D3.

See variation.];W[dq]C[Ns:  Big.];B[er];W[dr]
(;B[fq]C[slow move on my part.

NS: Yes, cut doesn't work.  See variation.];W[dj];B[jd]C[NS: big.]

[rr][sr][as][bs][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][qs][rs][ss]C[i felt this was a rather slow move that he did

NS: So this move, is actually bigger then you expect, because it expands his potential at the cost of yours.  With the two marked moves, it will be difficult to expand your bottom.  It is important in the early game to try to keep your stones flowing towards the center, because it increases your potential territory.

I'd estimate the score right now to be 44 to about 23 in pure territory.  Granted B has a nice Sanerensei, but A and B damage its prospects.]
;B[el]LB[dg:1][qg:2][go:3]C[so I'm not even sure what to call this move. I wanted to mess that  territory up and jump in there but i think this was as far as I could go. Could/should I have gone any deeper? Was it completely the wrong time and/or place?

NS:I think this move is your first really bad move This stone is instantly weak, and will be chased,  and W will gain influence from attacking it, while not losing much territory.  Now is the time to strengthen your stones on top.]
;W[fj]
(;B[gl];W[dl];B[ek];W[dk];B[ej];W[ei];B[gk]LB[fi:1]C[another slow move on my part, If I could do it over, I would have done a corner enclosure like c14 or maybe a cap at p10

So this move is a bit slow.  E7 accomplishes the same thing, and is more profitable. The marked cut should also be considered.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[NS: Good choice of joseki here.];W[cc]
(;B[dc]TR[jd]SQ[ei]C[wrong way right?

NS I think this move is fine, though marked moves look a bit better.]
