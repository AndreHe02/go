C[Hello dear reviewer:

Sorry to tell that i'm not very good at asking question bout my game ><||

If you do not mind, can you review it your own way?

Just tell me where should i respond?
Where should i improve?

P/S :if playing with stronger player helps to improve?

Jay: Hello, be glad to help.  It is always good to play with stronger players.  I think, though, the optimal is to play players 2 or 3 stone stronger.  Review like this is very helpful too.  You played solid in the first half, only to have faltered in middle game.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[eq];W[iq];B[cq]LB[kq:B][mq:A]C[Is this wrong respond?

i was thinking of A or B but i'm not really sure if my E3 can live after i move A or B.

can you show me your idea?

Jay: This is ok and simple.  It is a good idea to make yourself strong first before attacking J3 stone.  A is not good.  B is playable.]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[ep];B[gq];W[gp]
(;B[hq]C[Jay: This invites W to build big moyo on the left.  Tenuki is possible.]
;W[hp]
(;B[lq]LB[ip:A]C[Should i cut at A first?

I know i have to cut but then, i feel like cutting it at later.. is better, am i right?

however, A was covered after late game.

Jay: Cutting is not urgent.  Left side IS.];W[kq];B[lp]C[Jay: This exhange is good for B.]
;W[dj];B[nc];W[jc];B[ce]C[Jay: I would prefer D15 with higher position to emphasize the center.]
;W[de]C[Jay: W should pincher at D13];B[df];W[ee]C[after W E15, i don't really know which move should i move next. and so i move at C17.

Is that move correct?
Is there any other better choice?

Jay: When B played D14, you are committing to play the next move, otherwise D14 should not be played at all.  The next move could be either C16 or C17.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb]C[Jay: This move is better played at D18.  This leaves weakness at E17.]
;B[dh]TR[bb]C[B18 can do monkey jump, though i'm quite afraid of it but in my mind i think that...

"if W go a monkey jump maybe i can get exchange something with it"

is my thinking correct?

i know W will not monkey jump so early. i just feel a little afraid of it.. cuz it could kill my eye something.

is my D12 correct?

Jay: It's too early to worry about monkey jump.  That's for endgame. This move would be better at C12. You want to play defensively in area of W's superiority.]
;W[ch];B[cg];W[ci]
(;B[fh]C[my opponent told me that my F12 was wrong because my group is live already.
Are they really live?

i know my next move is Q10....  but then W gets it first ><|| because of my F12.

comment?

Jay: I don't agree. There are too much aji here for B that one has to be careful about.  Though W has weakness around E17, B also suffers from lack of eye shape on the left. W's K17 stone should be helpful in the fighting to follow.  B's move here to remove aji seems necessary.  W doesn't need to kill the W group.  The threats to do so will cause B much pain and make W's gain in the process. I make a few variations to illustrate B's problems. 

B's this move is ok. I would prefer F14 or even G13 to deploy faster toward the center.]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[qn];B[qp]C[Jay: B should split W at R8 now. Although this B move is big to get the corner it's not urgent. Allowing W settle is not too good and exposes B's own weakness at R14.]
;W[pl];B[on]C[i realised my P6 was wrong. after i have made a move...

why is that most of the time, after i have made a move, i realised that it was wrong ><||

i should have move P12 is that right?

give me ur comment also =)

Jay: Yes, P12 is much better.  There is a wider realization after a move is on the board for most of us, so it is normal.  This move is just too small.  Protectiong the weakness at R14 is urgent.]
;W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[pi]C[i don't think my Q11 is correct.

can you show me ur idea?

Jay: This is ok if you chose to fight.];W[nf];B[ni];W[nl];B[ll]
C[Jay: This is not a good move. I would jump out at M11to continue applying pressure to O14 group and also develop toward center quicker. This move doesn't even get any moyo for B, W's left side too strong.]
;W[mj];B[mg];W[mf];B[lg];W[lf];B[kg];W[lc];B[rf];W[rg];B[re]
;W[rh];B[ok];W[ol];B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[kj];B[jo]C[i made mistakes here, i should have cut.. but i forgot.. haha

Jay: In fact, this is a good move to prepare attacking W's L10 group.  Cutting is not so good because W K4 group would come out and counterattack.]
;W[ip];B[fq]C[my F3 wrong.. just afraid that... i cant live...

but are they really live? i somehow confuse... some strong player can kill them, i think so...

Jay: This move is better not played.  This is a slow move, away of the battle field. The corner is alive, thus, this is just a big endgame move. The urgency is to attack the middle W's group eyeing to destroy W's side on the left.]
;W[fj]C[Jay: Now, W's center group is almost home free, not good for B.]
;B[hh];W[hj]C[Jay: The left side is getting bigger and bigger for W, while B's last two moves have no potential of profiting at all, just small endgame moves.

W's this move could be better at J9 to be solid.];B[jj]
(;W[ji]C[Jay: W's this move is in the wrong direction.];B[ii]
;W[ij];B[jk];W[ki]C[Jay: It's strange for W to make the center group heavy and subject to attack like this.]

(;B[ig]C[comment bout this move.. please =)

my idea was that.. i'm afraid that my group cant live at P12 if white cut somewhere at K13.. something..

Jay: This is ok, but leaves some aji. I would play K12 to reduce to connect the two groups while reducing W's liberty. This will help in later fight.]
;W[kk];B[jl];W[kl]C[and so on.. if you don't mind.. review it your own way the rest of the game which you think is wrong by me ><||

should i improve my yose?

thank you]
(;B[km]C[Jay: This move is not good, better at K7.];W[jm]
(;B[jn]C[Jay: This atari is bad.];W[im]C[Jay: Giving up the three stones at K9 for sure has cost B the game.]

(;B[kd]C[Jay: This is small, helping W.  It is better played at H17 to exploit the weakness at E17.]
;W[jd];B[ke];W[qg]C[Jay: This game is lost for sure. No more comments beyond this point.]
