;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[jp];B[pj];W[nc]C[when white approaches me with such a move, what would be a better reply, the one I made (k17), to defend the corner, or to move down to f.ex. q13 to protect the side?]

- White broke into your moyo in the center. Why was she allowed to to that?
- Black's invasion backfired allowing white to secure the corner and take initiative on the right side

All in all a good game. I think your Go would benefit a lot from the study of basic shapes and applying them to your games. If you ever find yourself on KGS ask dsaun about it :)]
