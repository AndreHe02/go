(;W[cg]C[This is the first move i have to critisize. It is almost wasted because B can  still invade 3-3 point and reduce your corner territory to zero.
Locally C15 is better to secure the corner but this would be too slow.

see variations];B[cj];W[cm];B[dk]
(;W[mq]C[see variation];B[fq];W[jq]TR[cm]C[this seems slow. i still prefer E7 to pull out the marked stone]
;B[em];W[qm]LB[qc:2][qd:1][qg:3]C[here the same applies what i wrote about W7, Also  B has a good follow-up at P10 which would be the beginning  of a huge mojo in upper right.

on the other hand it is not easy for me to find the best move.
You played a very slow fuseki and a result B is clearly ahead now.
i have marked some possible alternatives which i like better.
1 can lead to quite complicated fights - so you might prefer 2 or 3]

(;W[pg]C[Nina> Should I have played this stone at B14?

No! B14 is not sente(see variation)
Q13 is right direction IMO];B[qe];W[ng];B[bf];W[cf];B[bg];W[ch]
;B[bh];W[ci];B[fi];W[dj]TR[cm]C[i dont like this move. it forces black to strengthen his own position
without achieving much. Also further weakening the marked w stone]
;B[ck]
(;W[ej]C[Nina>I was thinking -  how about B11 instead of this move or even C3?

B11 makes no sense because all black groups are strong.

C3 is worth to think about. W can at least get a ko and it can lead to a difficult fight
I tried to give some variations but the outcome is not clear.
Since you are behind C3 is a good start to create a fight];B[fj]

but it was mainly caused by poor play of black.

(;W[ao]C[Nina>I didn't actually have to take this group just yet,  so I should probably have played this stone elsewhere - how about P10?

you are right. killing the b stones now can be considered as the worst  move in this game until now- a completely wasted stone.
try to avoid this kind of move and your strength will increase by several grades.

p10 is an interesting option because b can not connect easily ( see variation)]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi];B[rg]C[Nina> This really hurt - but what else could I have done?]

;W[kl]LB[ie:5][ne:4][rh:1][gj:6][kk:A][qq:3][hr:2]C[not good. the cut at A is useless and the  white mojo is open on two sides
i have numbered some bigger plays
1 is an intersting tactical play and was discussed earlier
2 is a very big endgame move and sente
3 is even bigger but gote
4 reduces b in sente
5 only 1 point but sente
6 is smaller then it looks(only ~10 pts in gote), but much better then L8]
;B[jl];W[kk];B[ji];W[eg]C[Nina>I've been playing these group of stones in order to reduce black's moyo, but I haven't gained any territory myself so I was thinking maybe there was a better way of playing ...

see comment on move 115. all options there still apply
i would probably start with H2 and if B defends launch the attack with S12]
;B[ij];W[qh];B[gj]C[B found the worst timing for this save. he could
have played here for the last 5 moves or so without loss.

;B[fc];W[ed]C[I played this move because I did not want black to save the two stones at F14-15 so these stones cannot be used to reduce my already small territory but was there a better move?]
;B[fb];W[da];B[cb];W[ie]C[Nina> Should I have played F19 or something first?
F19 is sente(must be answered) this kind of move cannot be bad]
;B[je];W[jf]C[this cannot gain anything];B[jh];W[li]C[Nina> I was really worried about black breaking through here so I played this stone, but what I really wanted to do was to reduce black's moyo on top right - just couldn't think of any good move though.
