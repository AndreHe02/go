;B[lj];W[mj];B[mh]C[> Summary:

One thing handicap games teach is how to play when ahead (Black) and when behind (White). That is, for Black, simplify by using the huge lead in influence; for White, complicate and take risks.

In this game, Black made a slack shape at N15, a mistake in direction with R11, and a blunder with P3. He also took unnecessary risks with the weird move of B9. Yet overall, he stuck to the basic strategy of simplifying the game.

After offering early thickness with Q17, White went on to reinforce Black at E16. White did complicate the game notably with C6, but then played even game moves to help the group directly. That was not so good a strategy here. White needed to create weak black groups. She failed to take advantage of the only target Black had offered after his B9 move.

So for Black, push the opponent towards your thickness, and do not let your groups get sealed ! It will make fighting easier.

For White, first avoid helping Black, then spot chances and invite him into fights whenever necessary. Put your superior reading to use !]
