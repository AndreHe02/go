C[I resigned.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[as white i normally dont play this:
now there are 5 big corner points and black takes 3 of them (2 4-4 points and a kakari)
however, if _black_ plays chinese he has another stone on the side before white can play the kakari, so the kakari isn't good.  perhaps it's a matter of taste, dont know if its really bad (ask a 1 dan :-)]
;B[de];W[fd]
(;B[dj]C[bad? should I maybe have gone into the corner with C17. I was not too sure how to answer W F16.

perhaps it is possible if you want to prohibit white from making a moyo and/or  want to play lightly (creating a lot of possibilities).
however, your stones are overextended, so soon or later white will play between them and fighting will follow

The variation is a joseki which is possible (i'm not sure the last move, the extension, is the correct distance)]
;W[dg]C[Indeed, such a wide extension invites an invasion];B[dn]
C[personally i prefer C6 which can revert to a joseki (D4, C6, F4, D10)
D10-D6 is more easily invadable i think.];W[fp];B[pj]C[hm, dan players often play so confusing, but i like to limit the possibilities more.
I feel D6-D10 asks for some extra stone to make that group more stable. perhaps then you can aim at the revival or the aji of D15]
;W[dl]C[With hindsight, this position has virtually mapped out the game:- white got the left, and my moyo on the right established by the sanren-sei was successfully invaded by white.

that seems possible. on the other hand, not everything is lost i think]

(;B[fn]C[perhaps first you must cut D4 and D8 by playing C4 or C5 (see variations)
This must happen in sente
This could then prevent move 18 (White C6) threatening to connect.]
;W[fl];B[hn];W[hp]
(;B[jo]C[i prefer the variations];W[cn];B[jd]C[I thought I may have recovered my mistakes on the left, at this point, because of the framework I had.

however, C6 was a very powerful sente move.connecting D8 F8 with the corner and leaving you with 3 weak groups on the left.
you framework can be invaded very easily.
observe that i white now plays c5, he has nearly 30 points of secure territoy in the lower
left corner and the possibility to capture at least one of the 3 weak groups, moreover, he has secure territory in the upper left. Since his group D8-F8 is then connected securely, all his stones radiate influence, which is only slightly less than the influence of your framework.]
;W[ff];B[jq];W[nc];B[lc];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[od];W[nd];B[pf]
C[too defensive?

also consider playing  R14(defending also the cut at R16)
R13 and Q13 which are less defensive];W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[mb]
;W[nb];B[jf];W[ic];B[id]C[the actual game proves this to be bad]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb]C[oops! m18 better];W[lb];B[gc];W[fc]
;B[gb];W[fb]
(;B[ge]C[living in the corner is perhaps still possible(variation). dont throw away that aji by saving a group that is already able to live without such a sacrifice or to escape lightly in the center.

variations show  1. life in the corner
2. easy life of the group on the upper side];W[fe];B[gf];W[gg]
;B[hg];W[gh];B[hh];W[gi]C[I know white has built up a huge wall/territory on the left, but I wasn't sure how else to play.

indeed, you're giving white sixth and seventh line territoy without getting much back.
better was to let the group at j16/g18 die, using the aji to successfully invade the left side.
see variation of move 47 if you want to save it];B[hl]C[notice that your framework is very open.
white can enter with upper side group and from the left.
so i would prefer a move which prevents invasions (such as R3)]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[qp]
(;B[qq]C[you want to save your framework, not you corner, not even the stone on q4.

==> if you want to live, attach! if you attack, keep some distance   see variations for some other ideas]
;W[rp];B[po];W[pn];B[rm]C[these were the same moves as played top right up to here, but because of the unsatisfactory result (maybe due to the k18 mistake with hindsight) I played S7 here(......the corresponding move would have been O5)

you are making white strong with too many forcing moves i think]

;W[rs];B[qs];W[ps];B[sr];W[sp]C[was there a way to catch that white group centered around P2? there's a bit of aji left around the R5 white group, but I was a bit disappointed here. I cut next at Q7 to stop white getting out into my moyo.]
