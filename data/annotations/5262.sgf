C[I'm now 2D on IGS. This is a confused-fighting game so although
I won, I don't sure if my fighting plays are good enough or not.
Please review for me (I'm White), thank you very much.  Black

It was really hard for me to understand what is happening on the board :)]

(;W[on]C[I think this move is too quick since my shape after cutting is
bad and my group isn't strong yet.

;B[mf]C[A good move, on the border of two moyos]
(;W[jo]MA[ci]C[Is this move good or keima better?

Breakfast: Both are dame points. How about extending around X and taking territory? -]
;B[hq]MA[fq]C[Too close. Must be at X, preventing the invasion]

;W[gk];B[ho]C[Now the position is very complicated. Black was far behind, now he has a chance]
;W[gj];B[gi];W[hi]C[I think I can't just let black settle the center or the game'll
be bad.];B[fi];W[li]C[Is this attacking move good? I'm in time trouble around here...

;W[en]C[I've counted that the score isn't bad for me, so I play safe.

Breakfast: Yes, it's good. White is leading, so you can play solidly.
