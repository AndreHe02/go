C[J: Hi my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing you game. My comments begin with "J:".]
;B[qq]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking into my game. It was played on Tygem at standard (20min + 3*30 sec) time control and I resigned, playing white, at move 211, although the game was over a long time before that.

In this game my opponent followed the strategy "I live on the second line everywhere you're trying to make territory while trying to kill you". This works extremely well against me, as it did in this game. I wonder what in my approach is wrong, when playing against such a style. Clearly enaugh, the style, be it even "objectively bad" doesn't matter at all at this level of play, rather the one who wins is the one who finds the ways to kill and live. My opponent was obviously stronger at reading and fighting than me and that is why I lost. Still, I think there should be much to learn for me from this game. Looking forward to your advice.]
;W[dd];B[nq]C[J: This feels slow for black. Normally, with the 3-3 stone is played, it can be considered settled locally. When black adds an extra move, black is only increasing a few points.]
;W[qd];B[cq]C[J: black's bottom side is low.];W[pj]LB[dn:A]
[oc:B][qj:C]C[this move might not be that good. I wanted to play in that area to prevent a nice extension from black's corner, but this move doesn't prevent that at all while actually not doing much. I didn't like the idea of playing low though, as it didn't seem to work well with R16.

Then again the opening doesn't matter one bit in these kinds of games.

J: Another idea here, is that white can try to keep black's bottom side low, or take your own enclosure with P17. Regardless, there's nothing inherently wrong with Q10. R10 is also possible to keep match black's territory potential.]
;B[rj]C[J: S10 is much too low now.]
(;W[kc]C[I try to argue that black's move is too slow, trying to take away something I don't look forward to having. There doesn't seem to be a good way to attack that stone either.

J: White should think about making the R12 trade, as it connects white's position, while leaves black over extended. See variation.]
;B[kb]C[And here I basically knew that I was going to loose the game. People who play like this at 4k are good enaugh at reading to make it work.

J: When black touches a stone like this, it is already lacking in liberities. The best result for black would be living small in gote, or running away.]

(;W[lc]LB[gc:A][oc:B]C[J: Because the A direction is wider, M17 should be at K17 or K18 instead to push black towards the narrower side. See variations.]
;B[lb];W[mc]C[J: K17 is still ok.];B[mb];W[nc];B[jc];W[jd];B[ic]
C[J: White is pushing black from behind.];W[id];B[qg]C[J: Black is very confident.]
;W[hc];B[hb]
(;W[gc]C[J: G17 is slack. G18 is the correct move. See variation.]
;B[gb];W[fc];B[qe];W[pd];B[re];W[of]C[trying to build the center basically. I'm not sure if I'm even ahead at this point.]
;B[oh]
(;W[cj]C[J: P12 is a strange shape, white can attempt to seal black with Q12. C10 is large none the less. See variation.]
;B[cg]C[J: C13 is unreasonable.];W[ce]C[J: C7 or E10 are possible responses. Strengthen first before attacking.]
;B[ci]
(;W[di]C[J: Hane probably not necessary here. Simply extending to D10 is enough. That way, white's shape is stronger. White does not need to try to kill black here. See variation.]
;B[bi];W[dh];B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[cl];B[bf];W[be]C[Kindo need territory somewhere. This move is terrible though. I have 0 points still on this board and only that huge wall facing something like a sad 30 potential points, which won't win me the game.

J: B15 is ok, black still needs to spend a move to live afterwards.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[bh]C[This move is completely unnecessary.];W[og]
C[I'm hoping black would connect, but of course he shouldn't and doesn't. Building the center doesn't look very promising and Q10 will be in trouble.

J: P13 can be responded with by P11. Should be P12. See variations.]

(;B[nh];W[ph]C[Still I feel compelled to cut this. It doesn't do anything but maybe attempt to connect Q10.]
;B[qi];W[pi]C[J: Result is good for white. There is now a target to attack.]
;B[lh]C[The game is lost at this point.

J: There is still a lot of room on this board. White is definately behind,  bute black has a floating group in the center.]

(;W[mg]C[J: N13 is the wrong direction. White should push a weak group into its strength. Here, killing black may be possible. Maybe start with N9. See variation.]
;B[mh];W[jh]MA[gf][gg][hf][hg]C[J: K12 is once again in the wrong direction. Trying to make points with a wall is misguided. N9 is still possible.]
;B[lg]C[J: Now that white has blocked from the middle side, black should simply jump away to M9.]
;W[le]C[J: White should still try to surround.];B[pg];W[nj]
C[J: White could have already had a stone around here earlier.]
;B[jg];W[ig];B[lj]C[J: Now that black has run away, the game becomes very difficult.]
;W[ol]C[J: P8 is solid but slow. In these drastic situations, white needs to play more dangerously, maybe N8 to keep pressure on black.]
;B[jf]
(;W[ih]C[J: White has no time to fix this cut. Cutting here won't help black gain an eye here anyway. White should keep black sealed with M7. See variation.]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[lf]C[wrong move. I was looking at disconnecting K14, then this move simultanously takes away the eye and I was tempted. Then again maybe trying to kill black and hoping for him to make the 10 blunders in a row to make it possible is the only hope I have left.

J: Good idea. When this is your last winning condition, you must followthrough.]
;B[me]C[black reveals the second part of his strategy: trying to kill things that don't have two eyes yet.

J: N15 doesn't help do that here, as it's not possible to cut L16 right now. Black should just play M8 to run away while attacking white's P8 group.]

(;W[kg]C[I decide to be greedy as I'm behind by a lot here.

J: With the capture of the two center stones, in terms of solid points, the game is actually even on the board, black has around 30 points, and white around 26 + komi. White is now only behind because of the weak P8 group.

J: White can still try to attack the center by playing O15 in an attempt to preempt black's connection at P15.]
;B[md]C[Now I have to live in the corner. Looking at this objectively, it's probably dead though.

J: Black cannot easily cut L16 nor P16 here, so white's corner isn't in danger yet. attacking with M7 is still the best idea. See variations.]

(;W[rd]C[J: S16 is only worth about 5 points in the endgame.]
;B[ld];W[kh]C[maintaining the two stones... I still have 0 territory though, not even the sad 30 points in the middle.

J: L12 is not as important as connecting L16.];B[kd];W[je]C[J: L15 is better, as it is more points in the endgame and restricts black's liberites.]
;B[nb]
(;W[pb]C[trying to live somehow.

J: P17 looks like it leads to a ko, and white has more ko threats right now. See variations.]

(;B[oc];W[od]C[maintaining connection to the 3 stones below, thus keeping black's right group disconnected, as I figure I need aji there to live.]
;B[nd];W[se]C[still trying to live

J: S18 is clear life.];B[fb];W[eb]C[wrong move.

J: The block looks ok.];B[ec];W[ed];B[dc]
(;W[cc]C[J: White should play D18. See variation.];B[db];W[cb]
;B[ea]
(;W[if]C[still need to fix...

J: Not worth fixing yet. See variation.];B[hd]C[black cuts, as on all of his moves, without spending more than 2 seconds on it.]
;W[fd];B[pc];W[qc];B[ob]C[looks like I'm dead?

J: Still a ko. See variations.]
(;W[rf]
(;B[pe]C[J: Q15 is a large mistake. Must be R14 See variation.]
;W[qh];B[oe];W[rh]C[J: This result great for white. White is still behind by about ten points after komi, but the weak P8 group is connected.]
;B[rk]C[there is no way to kill black, especially since living on the edge is what he's best at.

J: Black shouldn't try to live here. Instead, bplay a move like F4 to expand the bottom side.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[rn]C[wrong move. I should follow the newly made-up go proverb "never hane on the second line".

J: Hane is ok here.];B[ql];W[qn];B[pl]C[Fron here on the game is over and probably not worth looking at, in the end I even end up dying all over the place while still having 0 points. It's still include for completeness sake. I hope you can tell me where I went wrong and once again, thank you very much for your effort.

J: The game is still very playable.]
(;W[on]C[J: P6 is a good shape move, but when it comes to capturing, reducing black's liberties with Q7 is better. See variations.]
;B[ok];W[om];B[pk]
(;W[rg]C[J: White must block black at O9. Even if white gets a nice 10-point endgame with Q14. See variation.]
;B[nk]C[J: Letting black cut through is very painful. This is the first point in the game where I would consider white too far behind. White must care for two groups now.]
;W[pp];B[pq];W[rp];B[qp];W[qo];B[rq]
(;W[oq]C[J: P3 is inexplicable. Simply P4 is good enough for life. See variation.]
;B[op];W[po];B[or];W[mm];B[ne]C[J: If white had blocked O9, O15 would only be endgame. But now, it threatens white's life.]

;W[sm];B[rl];W[mo];B[kl];W[kj];B[li];W[ik]LB[kl:A][mm:B]C[J: There is no time to play J9 right now. The game hinges on the battle between these two groups. White must fihgt with a move like L5.]
;B[jl];W[kn];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[kp];B[qj];W[qb]C[I think this should live without ko.

J: Ko is the best that white can get here.];B[sf];W[sg]C[ but terrible blunder...

J: White can ignore T13 and play T18 for life, but the loss of S12 tail is too great in terms of points and potential to attack S10.]
;B[sc];W[sb];B[rb];W[ra];B[sa];W[ri];B[si];W[sb];B[ke];W[kf]
;B[sa];W[qf];B[pf];W[sb];B[jf];W[rc];B[ie];W[he]C[at this point it doesn't matter anymore, but still it's sad how bad the moves are that I'm making.

J: Now that the top group is alive, white's last chance is to kill the K8 group. Must start at J8.]
;B[ge]C[J: Blkc should seal the game with J8 to make life.]
;W[hf];B[gd];W[ff];B[kr]C[J: L2 should still be at J8.];W[hm]
C[J: H7 is a good move if the plan is to attack black and make center territory.]
;B[hn];W[gm];B[cn]C[J: Neither black nor white's groups are alive yet.]

;W[gq];B[fp];W[en];B[fn]C[J: Black's group is finally safe, but I can't say the same for white's group.]
;W[fm];B[gr];W[il]C[J: White must make life with something like J4 now. But black is too far ahead now in terms of points.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[ip]C[J: White's group is dead now.];W[do];B[bo]
;W[dp];B[dq];W[dm];B[lp];W[lo]C[Blunder. If I were to live, black is ahead by about 30 points.]
;B[sp];W[pm];B[nn]TR[kb][bh][rk]C[I resign.

J: I think the takeaway from this game is that white should not be too jealous of black's points. White started with a 4-4 point signifying that they are willing to fight instead of instant gratification with points.

J: When black makes small territory as with the marked areas, the most important thing is to keep it surrounded or pressured, limiting its potential points. That way, that group becomes a liability to worry about instead of a foothold for use in attacks.

J: Thanks for showing me this game.])
