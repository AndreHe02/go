C[Mark: Hi, I'd like feedback on the first hundred moves or so.  I felt at sea for much of the opening and was confused about where the big plays were.

\\m/ : Hi Mark, here your review.
Interesting game showing how the opening can be important in this game. In my opinion, it's the mistake in direction at move 32 that cost you the game. To gain some good theory about direction, you can consider reading "Direction of Play" by Takeo Kajiwara. With "Lessons in the fundamentals of go" which cover another subjects, these are the two books that I consider a player who want to improve must read. Of course, it's only my opinion and I am far from being a good player ;)]

(;B[cn]C[\\m/ : I don't like it, not really threaten d3 and not taking the maximum of ni ren sei.]
(;W[fp]C[Mark: Not joseki according to Kogo's.  Okay, IIRC, I am already emphasizing the bottom side with a 3-4 play.  Perhaps I don't need another move?  Clearly, my move puts no pressure on black, while C4 and D5 do.  Both serve a dual purpose --- attack the black stone and extend white's framework near the corner.  My stone does neither.]

[nc][qc]C[Mark: Kogo's believes this point should be at O16, but I don't see an easy way to punish black.

;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb]TR[mc][nd]C[\\m/ : see that you finally punish the joseki mistake as b feels the need to protect cut. So you had answered your question at move 15 during the game ;)]
