Hi,

I'm Julian, and I'll be reviewing your game.  I'm about AGA 3-4 dan, though I haven't played in a ranking tournament in a long time.

All my comments will appear under a separator - if there was text in the node before, it will be above the separator.]
;B[pq];W[dc];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq];W[jd];B[ce];W[gd];B[ch];W[jp]
;B[qo]C[----------------------------------------
Excellent move.  W's play inside B's framework is premature, and this demonstrates why.  B hasn't commited to taking the bottom, and can just take territory elsewhere if W invades.]
;W[mq]
(;B[iq]LB[jq:A]C[----------------------------------------
This is B's first really questionable move.

The shoulder hit generally strengthens both players, and here, where W is weak, B would rather not provoke a play at 'A'.

Your opponent's weak groups are assets, and plays like this which strengthen weak groups cost you points!]
;W[jq]LB[qf:A]C[not sure what to do about his thin and high shape up top

----------------------------------------
It's hard to fault your approach at 'A'. W's top territory remains invadable, and B can start building some territory on the right side.]
;B[qf];W[qe]C[also have no idea here

----------------------------------------
Your response here is fine.  The R15 Q14 exchange still leaves the corner open to invasion and helps B build territory along the right side.

This exchange is favorable for B.];B[pf];W[md]
(;B[od]MA[md]LB[nd:A]C[well theres something similar for 4 3 joseki

----------------------------------------
This is a strong move - W should have played the marked stone at 'A'.

That said, without the correct follow up, this can be a terrible move.  It's better to leave forcing moves unplayed until you know how to best take advantage of them - "play first, read later" just costs you opportunities in the long run.

B should take a step back and consider his position before making this play (see variation).]

Here's B's mistake - see the variations.];W[nd];B[oe];W[pc]
;B[ld]C[----------------------------------------
This is a clever idea, but doesn't quite work here.];W[lc];B[le]
;W[mc]C[----------------------------------------
All in all this result is very unfortunate for B.  W has secured the corner and part of the top, and all B has gotten in exchange is an imperfect wall.]
(;B[ip]MA[od][oe][pf][qf]C[----------------------------------------
An extension along the right side is large now, allowing B to both take territory and settle the marked stones.]
;W[op]LB[io:A];B[jo]C[----------------------------------------
Excellent!  B is beginning to build a substantial moyo on the left. while attacking W.]
;W[pp]C[----------------------------------------
This is aji-keshi.  After B's response the corner is secure and W has gained next to nothing.

----------------------------------------
Eventually, a play at A would be a substantial reduction, but at the moment it would provoke a strong counter attack against the marked stones.]
;W[ie];B[hd]C[----------------------------------------
This is small and aji-keshi.  If W hadn't missed the cut later this move would just have cost B.]

;B[oi];W[oj]
(;B[ni]C[----------------------------------------
This is generally good shape, and connecting is always valuable, but in this case where W is weak too, this is a little too defensive.]
;W[pi]C[----------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
Yup!];W[sm];B[so]C[trickyness [?\]: LOL];W[qk];B[rd];W[rc];B[re]
;W[qd];B[ff]C[----------------------------------------
This is premature.

If W settles himself cleanly on the side, this move is worth almost no points.  B should attack W's side stone first, and then come back and play this if the situation merits it.]

C[theres something about not making territory in the center but I don't know where else to
----------------------------------------
While you shouldn't make making center territory your primary plan, if your opponent is willing to oblige you by helping you build big walls, it makes sense to go with the flow of the game.]

[am][an][bk][bl][bm][bn][mo][no]C[----------------------------------------
Generally it felt as if this was a fairly easy game for you.  W made several slow plays, and failed to take advantage of your mistakes.

The most important suggestion I can make is that you make a habit of counting the score from a much earlier point.  There were many times when you could have made a simple play and secured a victory without a fight, but you instead played much more aggresively and gave your opponent opportunities to catch up.

Against a stronger player those opportunities could well have turned the game around.

The second thing I would note is a tactical point.  At a couple points in the game you played contact plays or a cross cut in areas where you were strong and your opponent was weak (see moves 13 and 125).  As a general rule, such plays strengthen both players, and if you're already strong you end up overconcentrated while your opponent builds strength.  Try attacking from a distance when you have the advantage!

Thank you for the opportunity to review your game - it was a lot of fun, and feel free to email me if you have any questions!]

Most of the groups on the board are well settled.  

B's stones marked by squares could eventually come under attack, but at the moment at least have lots of places to run to.

W's marked stone is baseless, and attacking it may be profitable.  It is light though, and easy to sacrifice.

B should be looking for ways to attack the marked stone and secure profit.]

W has about 34 points of solid territory, and the potential to make about 21 more points along the top.  While W might make a small handful of points elsewhere by invasion, he is unlikely to do so profitably.

B has only about 25 points of solid territory, but most of the rest of the board is his for the taking.  To win the game, B needs to secure only about 30 points more than the marked points.]
