;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[po];B[cm]C[Unusual, but not unknown];W[gp]
;B[dj];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[pj]C[This exchange is BAD for B.  W12 is ideal.]
;B[nq]LB[jc:a][lc:b][oq:c][pq:d][qq:e]C[B should finish the joseki by playing at 'a'.  If he does not he is left with a weak point at 'b'.

The joseki moves in this shape are 'c', 'd', 'e'. 13 is not good.]
;W[pq];B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[kq];B[mp];W[ip];B[lq];W[hp]LB[iq:a]
C['a' is more solid];B[bp]LB[co:a]C[Big point - well over 20pts.  There is a huge difference between this and Wa.]
;W[cq];B[fd]C[B has a nice fuseki,];W[jd]LB[jc:a]C[W will make shape better is he palys this low.]
;B[ld];W[jf];B[mf]LB[mg:a][ph:b][jh:c]C['a' is better.  It threatens both 'b' and 'c']
;W[lo];B[mo]C[B should connect - there is no point in resisting and being cut into two.]
;W[lp]LB[lr:a]C[Should play at 'a' to either scoop out Bs base or make 32 sente.  If B connects at 32  it make B31 look like a silly move.]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[jo];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[jm];W[in];B[mm]C[nice shape for B. W is badly overconcentrated.]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[ll];B[op]LB[qp:a]C[Very bad.  Aji keshi.  This loses 'a' and the threat to live  on the side.]
;W[pp];B[mk]LB[ml:a][ff:b]C['a' prevents the cut, but permits W to play a ladder breaker around 'b'.  It is best to just connect.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[nm];B[lk];W[kl];B[jk]LB[nk:a][jl:b][ol:c][kk:d]
C[This wold be a nice move if it works, but W can escape with the series of ataris starting with 'a' and 'd'. So when W plays 'a' B must give way in gote with Bb, Wc, Bd which secures a huge side for W.]
;W[lr]C[Miniscule. B does not need to answer  This is yose]
;B[ph]LB[ol:a]C[B has to play at 'a' to prevent the sequence shown at a  previous move.  It is too early to make this invasion.  B is not strong enough in the surroudning area to expect this to work.]

;W[ik];B[lm];W[jk];B[im];W[gk]LB[pm:a]C[No time for this - must be at 'a' to save the 2 stones.  If they are captured Ws attack is over.]
;B[on];W[oo];B[no];W[oj];B[nj]LB[rh:a]C[Very small - all of Bs stones are alive so why connect them together.  'a' is the move to separate W]
;W[ok]LB[oh:a]C[Both unneceassry and bad shape.  'a' is better.]
;B[oi];W[qh];B[pi]LB[qi:a]C[Should be at 'a'.  B has a ladder is W cuts.]

;W[hj];B[gi];W[fg];B[hi];W[ii];B[ih];W[jh];B[ki]C[Better to take the ko and make W use a ko threat.  This connection is a ko threat for B if he uses iut at the right time.]

;B[cp]LB[bg:a][bh:b][bf:c][cj:d][fo:e]C[B does not need to live here towin this game.  Capturing 4 stones in sente with Ba, Wb, Bc, Wd  followed by 'e' is big enough]
