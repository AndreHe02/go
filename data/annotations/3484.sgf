AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[H: Hello. I have added my own comments, they are annoted with "H:"
I am quite satisfied with this game overall, but made a few mistakes even I could pinpoint.
I would especially appreciate any comment on the yose because I paid attention to it for the first time...
Thank you.

Adam: Hello, my name is Adam Marquis and I'm around 6 kyu KGS/AGA. I hope this is helpful to you. In go the player who surrounds the most territory wins. Given that each player has the same number of moves, the player who is more efficient, making their stones work the hardest and fastest, wins.  In a handicap game white must catch up by being faster than black. You played a very light game - perhaps too much so. White at several points had several weak groups or weak links in strong ones. Even with non-optimal black response, these weak points caused you some trouble. These are things to think about. Good game by both sides. ~Adam J. Marquis]
;W[nq];B[oq]
(;W[jp]C[H: expanding quickly as black's move was slow

Adam: Black's move was strong and rather strong sente, as most contact plays are. See variations.]

(;B[gp]C[Adam: I believe O4 to be the only move at this point. It will remain a huge point on the board for some time, but I'll stop mentioning it here.]
;W[pf];B[qc];W[nc]C[H: Is this good? In a normal game, I would maybe jump to R10. But since a pincer would only hurt the black corner stones, I thought this would be good.

Adam: I personally would worry about extending downward's provoking black's O4. R17 is slow, and it is white's option as to how to procede. I think a valid option is just to move on elsewhere, approaching the final corner. O17 though, is I think a good handicap move. Provoking a fight where you've some wiggle room (where your stones have directions to go and many options) usually works to your advantage.]
;B[qf]C[Adam: I don't like R14. White gets some stability out of this exchange. I would contact at O16: it gives O17 stability but splits the two white stones. This leaves the other (Q14) as a valid target for black.]
;W[qg];B[qe];W[ph];B[nd]C[Adam: Bad timing methinks. This strengthens O17, but now the R13 group is has some shape and is less of a target.]
;W[md];B[ne]C[Adam: I'm not sure if N16-O15 was good for white if the intent was to tenuki now. It seems to me like black can play M17 or another attack to even greater effect in this position.]
;W[qn]C[Adam: Black loses a chance to take to the attack here by playing the huge move at O4.]
;B[rp];W[pk]C[H: is it the right timing? there are still a lot of big points (and the N16 stones are not safe at all), but I'm securing a good side here and I'm a little worried about the tengen stone.

Adam: There are a lot of big points on the board right now, it is still very much the opening. On the other hand, Q9 seems a very nice place to have a stone for white. Even further, white has big weaknesses on the top and bottom, I don't think leaving black a chance to fragment white more is wise. (Again, I believe O4 to be the best for white here. Even more than before, it makes weak black's corner.)]
;B[df];W[ck]TR[ch][cn]C[H: since black does't seem to care for my lonely stones on the upper side, I just take the big points.

Adam: This is a good wedge to break up black, as white has both triangled points to make a safe extention. Protecting weaknesses might have been more urgent (esp. since O4 is [I am rather certain\] sente in a big way on the black corner), but giving black sente would put white in an uphill battle.]

;B[iq];W[jq]
(;B[cn]C[H: black leaves a bad shape in the lower right corner... If he leaves it to play this, then I think I have plenty of time before going back to haunt him...

Adam: Do you refer to the stone in atari at N4 and such? I think black made a good move in not protecting it. If white takes it now, black should be happy.]

(;W[ch]C[H: so I extend to be safe here and threaten the corner

Adam: Good.];B[cg];W[lc]C[Adam: Again, igorning the contact is bad news. D12 greatly strengthens black and sets up white's left side as a juicy target.]
;B[jd]
(;W[le]C[H : i wanted to build thickness while threatening (it is more scaring though, because the corner isn't in real danger). Then I'll be able to attack K16.

Adam: If jumping out, why not M14? See vars.];B[ng];W[hd]C[H: Is that a good attack? Maybe H17 is better to secure territory while attacking?

Adam: This may push the boundaries of how much white can expect to get away with at 5 stones. Black is still sitting on D12 so the left is currently weak above and beyond these two groups. Even the simple move of black K15 seems to put white in a very hard place (esp. if D12 is played first). Black plays a mistake here, I think s/he imagined a black stone at N15.]
;B[kd]C[Adam: This peep makes sense with a stone at black N16 (for then white must protect against the nasty cut), but not here.]

(;W[jf]C[H: J14 better?

Adam: Yeah. This leaves black a nice avenue of escape. With J14, black's escape is more difficult.]
;B[ie]C[Adam: Great move by black.];W[id];B[je];W[jc]C[H: I spent a minute to think about this. I still believe it's the best way to keep my territory on the upper side.

Adam: It doesn't, black has a tesuji to split them, see vars. I'm not sure exactly where white 45 should be though, after J15 white is in rough times. Perhaps I'd simply connect at L14 (since white is weakened here as a result of the J16/K15 exchange) and see what black does. D12 remains a thorn in white's side, as black's corner can't be attacked effectively while it remains unplayed.]

(;B[ld];W[me];B[hf];W[kc]C[H: was this necessary?

Adam: Yes.];B[kf];W[cq]C[sugo [17k\]: read my mind!
Graou [12k\]: ^^

Adam: Black is slow, good move. This will, however, further weaken the left side by strengthening black.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[ir]C[Adam: Black leaves white the convenient clamp at F2, see vars.]

(;W[ec]C[Adam: This seems to invite D17 from black. This seals up the corner nicely and is sente on the just placed E17 stone. I don't think this move is worth giving up corner aji and sente for.]
;B[gc]C[Adam: Black mistake.];W[gd];B[fd];W[fc];B[ed];W[oo]
C[H: Now I feel that these are the biggest moves, by far.

Adam: D12! D12! Also, although C18 isn't big enough for now it is rather large. It prevents black from playing D17 and taking a large corner in sente.]
;B[op];W[mo]C[Adam: The first peep was good, but this one I'd tend to ignore as black and just push through at O5. White threatens to take a stone that is already threatened.]
;B[lo]C[Adam: Black mistake.];W[mp];B[ln]C[Adam: This makes the mistake worse, black needed to abandon these suckers, perhaps pushing through at O5. They are not very valuable stones, as they don't hamper the white position much at all.]
;W[no]C[Adam: Good. Black should now fear for the corner. (esp. at 5 stones).]
;B[pn]C[Adam: Strange, but white handles it well. My life and death is poor and I don't dare comment on the corner situation.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[ro];B[qq];W[rn];B[kl];W[in]C[H: I could enclose a large moyo on the right, but i feel like destroying black's territory instead.

Adam: playing on the right wouldn't be a moyo per se (moyo = large potential territory framework) but rather white grabbing some more territory. It's good that you didn't feel like doing that, as white needs to be active in this position to have a chance at winning. D12 and D17 remain black sente, and after playing them black could get enough of the center to pull a good win if white plays a gote expansion on the white. This is a critical stage of the game and white is behind by my count.]
;B[jn]C[Adam: A waste, this is a thank you move that forces white to connect.]
;W[io];B[jo]C[Adam: Ditto];W[ip];B[im];W[cb];B[bh]C[Adam: Wrong direction, but still very tough on white.]
;W[dh]C[Adam: Not sure where white needs to be to defend here, but I'm rather sure this isn't it. Black has a nice move in store, see vars.]

(;B[rg]C[Adam: Painfully slow gote move for black.];W[rh];B[sf]
;W[bd]C[H: thanks black !

Adam: Black thanks you back for not defending the C12 group ^_^. Joking aside, this is quite large, but by far the most important point on the board is white's hanging group.]
;B[dc];W[db];B[be];W[bi]C[Adam: Black let you off easy by being more concerned with protecting his/her group to attack yours. If black played B11, strengthening his group in an active way, white would be in trouble.]
;B[bf];W[fg];B[bc]C[H: I didn't think of that.. I should have played C16. The black group wasn't alive yet (or so I think)

Adam: If black made mistakes, s/he could die here, but white shouldn't count on it. Developing the D12 group and destroying black's center is the way to win for white at this point.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bb];B[ad];W[gk];B[gi];W[fi];B[gh];W[fh];B[gf]
;W[ml];B[ek]C[H: this hurts a lot

Adam: Not that badly, white shouldn't expect to make a large territory here. Also, black is open in the H5 area and the F2 clamp is still available.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[fk];B[el];W[ej];B[dk];W[dj];B[cl];W[bl];B[dm]
C[H: any better sequence to defend the reduction? Here I just end up helping black make a lot of territory.]
;W[gn]C[H: but not that much actually so it's ok.

Adam: I would worry about the left group here. See variation.]
;B[bj]C[h: this hurts again

Adam: This DOES hurt, excellent play by black. Even in a handicap game never underestimate your opponent.]

(;B[hl]C[H: well, thank you black for not playing G8.

Adam: Yes, that would be quite game over for white.];W[gl];B[fn]
;W[eq]C[Adam: F2 works better, as black can (I think) simply F2 here.]
;B[ep];W[fq]
(;B[gq]C[H: Thanks again fo not playing F2];W[fr];B[fp];W[go]
;B[fo];W[nh]C[H: this ended up badly for me. I suppose O11 is better.

Adam: I'd have gone O11, but that doesn't mean it is better.]
;B[gr];W[es];B[nm]C[Adam: Bad by black, no escape.];W[mm];B[mn]
;W[nn];B[on]
(;W[mq]C[h: I should have taken the ko in R4.

Adam: If you had lost that ko, you would have been knocked far out of the game. For example: if white takes the ko, black plays F7. White responds, and black takes the ko. White needs a 20+ point threat to cover the potential loss of black taking the O5 group and saving the P6 stones.]
;B[ni]C[H: this hurts (again). It ended well because (i think) black screwed up.
How to respond correctly?

Adam: Perhaps just the simple move at P12. I'm not sure though. Black has some nice aji about to exploit.]
