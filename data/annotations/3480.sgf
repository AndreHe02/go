;B[pp];W[pd];B[dq];W[dd];B[cf];W[ef]C[E14 is looking for outside infuence, but it would work better with a white stone in K16.  F16 or F17 would be more usual here.]

(;B[cd]C[Black can play C17 instead (see variation).];W[dc]
;B[di]C[To be consistent with C16, B should play C17 instead of D11.]

(;W[do]C[White could play C17, which is very big (see variation). C5 gives B a good move at D8.]

(;B[fp]C[B could play a pincer at D8 instead (see variation).]
;W[dl]C[Now W C17 becomes even more painful for B; the left B group could come under pressure.]
;B[qf]C[B could play O17 or N17 instead to go against white's plan of building a moyo at the top.]
;W[of];B[qd]C[This helps W build a moyo at the top, so B could try something else, such as Q17 or L17.]
;W[pc];B[pi];W[jd]C[Now W has a nice moyo, and good followup moves at C17 and R17.]
;B[kp];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[om]C[W P6 would be better to escape towards the center. Here R6 and P7 might be cut later. But W can simply play R3 to settle quickly (see variations).]

(;B[no]C[B could attack W more strongly (see variation).];W[qp]

(;B[hc]C[B has to play R3 instead (see variation) because W R3 would be too good for W. In any case, B H16 or M16 would be a better invasion point.]
;W[jc]C[Good.];B[eb];W[db];B[ib];W[fc];B[fb]
(;W[jb]C[W should play G16 instead (see variation)];B[gd];W[gc]
C[W seems to try killing B, but this can be envisaged only if B is sealed in. Here the exchange G17-G18 is only beneficial for B.]
;B[gb];W[ic]C[W does not gain anything with J17. Instead W could simply reinforce at F16.]

(;B[fd]C[Atari is usually bad; B gains very little and removes a W weakness. B misses a good opportunity of playing E17 (see variation).]
;W[ec];B[he];W[id]C[This is another forcing move which gains nothing (the W shape is quite bad) and reinforces the opponent. Do not play an exchange if it benefits your opponent more than you. J16 could be left as a potential ko threat for later.]
;B[hd];W[de]C[W was initially attacking a B invasion, but now plays a slow defensive move.]
;B[ce]C[B is very happy to reinforce here. The D15-C15 exchange is good for B.]
;W[jf]C[K14 is good for the W moyo, but now the W left group will come under pressure.]
;B[gg]C[B started with a weak invasion and is now putting pressure on W! This shows that W made several mistakes.]
;W[dg];B[ch];W[cg];B[bg];W[eh];B[gi];W[ei]
(;B[ck]C[This move on the third line below a stone on the fourth line is generally not good. By simply answering at C8, the opponent is strengthened and B didn't gain much. The exchange C9/C8 is not good for B. But here W can also answer at D10. See variations for possible alternatives to C9.]
;W[dj];B[cj];W[dk]C[W is now strengthened after linking his groups.]
;B[gk];W[gm];B[ig]C[B was already connected here, so B could play H8 instead, reinforcing the G9-G11 link.]
;W[ff]C[W F14 is a wasted move. B can ignore it.];B[gf]C[B is already connected and should play elswhere.]
;W[if]C[Once again W tries to remove eyes while B is not sealed in.  B can easily escape now. J14 will become a wasted move.]
;B[kh]C[B should play this way only if he is ready to resist at K12 at the next move.]
;W[jg]
(;B[ih]C[This is not consistent with L12. B could play K12 instead (see variation)]
;W[jh]C[W is very happy to push through. L12 has become a wasted move.]
;B[ji];W[ij]C[Do not peep when you only strengthen your opponent and getting nothing in return.]
;B[ii]C[B is happy to connect here. Now the B group is out of trouble and B could even end up with some territory in the center.]
;W[hf]C[Again W is wasting ko threats, trying to kill at any cost.]
;B[hg]C[B is too submissive here.];W[fe]C[W likes forcing moves too much. Keep them for later as potential ko threats.]
;B[ge];W[hj]
(;B[mi]C[B can simply connect at G10 (see variations)];W[ki]
;B[kj];W[li];B[lj];W[lh];B[jj]C[This time B should do another forcing move at N12, because the N12-M13 exchange benefits B more than W.]
;W[gj];B[il];W[fj];B[mh];W[lg];B[mg];W[mf];B[qq]C[Finally!]
;W[po];B[op];W[iq];B[kq];W[jo];B[jp]C[Avoid empty triangles, this is very bad shape.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[jn]
(;B[in]C[B can play H5 instead to attack the J3 invasion (see variations)]
;W[im]C[J7 does not help W, so do not play it.];B[jm];W[km]
;B[hm];W[kn]C[W is too heavy, with too many separated weak groups. B is strong now in this area.]

(;B[kl]C[B should play N7 instead (see variation).]
(;W[lm]C[Another ugly empty triangle. W should play N7 instead (see variation).]

(;B[mn]C[B should play S4 instead (see variation).];W[mm];B[ol]
;W[nn];B[lo]C[N5 instead would make W P5 gote.];W[oo];B[rm]
C[If B decides to ignore the W O4 threat, B S4 is better than S7.]

(;W[os]C[W should play M3 instead.];B[rp];W[ro];B[qo];W[mj]

(;B[nj]C[B should ignore this threat (see variation).];W[qp]
C[Now B is in trouble.];B[sp];W[qo]C[W should play N2 instead.]

(;B[mq]C[B should play N2 instead to capture M2.];W[rq]C[W is too kind to give a prisonner and force B to live.]
;B[rr];W[mp]C[W must play N2 instead.];B[lq]C[Again B must play N2 instead to capture M2. B still wins the capturing race by one move, but it is better to avoid the race in the first place.]
;W[ps]C[With the Q1-R1 exchange, W reduces his own liberties. However it prevents B from playing P3 so it is not the losing move.]
;B[qs]
(;W[oq]C[Same here: W reduces his own liberties. Just play N2. B can't play P3 anyway because of a shortage of liberties. However even with N2 W loses the capturing race (see variation).]
;B[sq];W[mr];B[ls];W[ko];B[lp];W[nl]C[There is now little hope for W... O8 cannot make an eye.]
;B[ok];W[mk];B[ll];W[pm]C[W is dead in gote.];B[ml]C[N8 is not necessary. B can play a safe move somewhere else, such as G3 to ensure that J3 cannot come back to life.]
;W[nk];B[oi];W[pl];B[pk];W[qk];B[qj];W[rk];B[rl];W[oh];B[ph]
;W[og];B[rj]C[S10 is not necessary.];W[ng];B[ni];W[pg];B[qg]
;W[qc]C[R17 is a very big move, that both players should have taken much earlier. Unfortunately it is too late for W now.

In this game, W has been too agressive, trying too much to kill and creating too many weak groups. In general, you can gain more by putting pressure on the opponent than by trying to kill at all cost and fail. Also, erasing an opponent's moyo is often sufficient; you do not have to invade all the time.]
