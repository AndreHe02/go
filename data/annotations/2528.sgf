C[This is my third game from the Cambridge Trigantius 2003.

I managed one win and one loss so far, then went on to lose this one.

I've attempted to analyse this game myself, and have included my comments.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[oc];W[po];B[np]LB[pl:A]C[a pincer seems more natural here, to take advantage of your shimari.  I would play around A.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]LB[or:A]C[Post game discussion with my opponent 'a' is joseki]
;B[de]C[My opponent was surprised then when I made this tenuki. I thought I=
 had enough resilance and space along the bottom to survive



Survive, yes, but the weakness around P3 is pretty severe.  Joseki would be P2 or S2.  Then white will extend on the side to prevent the severe attack, and you still get sente to play D15 if you want to.]
;W[cg]C[If your opponent thinks you made a bad tenuki, he should punish you for it by playing at P3 or the like!  Otherwise, he's admitting that you don't really need a move.]
;B[cc];W[ed]LB[cb:B][cd:A][dd:C]C[A strange move.  According to Ishida (and common sense!) white should play A.  Occasionally B or C are playable.]
;B[dd]LB[cd:A]C[Probably better at 'A'?

Seems likely: it's more stable, and makes later moves at C11 or the like look more severe.

Instead of A, how about E15?];W[ec];B[jc];W[qk]C[White's extension this way is completely failing to punish you for not following the joseki.  White needs to find a tesuji somewhere around that P3 weakness.  How do you plan to answer if white plays P3?]
;B[qi];W[jq];B[lq];W[ef]C[Black's stones look thin everywhere except that beautiful top right formation.  P11 will threaten to invade at R7, so your top right is huge.  But your upper left is in serious danger, your lower right is weak, and white's bottom left has potential to be bigger than anything else on the board.  Looks like a good game for white so far.]

(;B[bf]C[If you have to make a move like this, your opening is definitely bad.  How about fighting your way out, as shown in the variation?]
;W[bg];B[cf]C[Now I'm getting confined in the corner


You got confined in the corner when you played tenuki instead of continuing in this corner (that is, it was greedy of you to take K17; you needed another move in this corner).

And what if white plays another move here?  (see variation)]

(;W[jo]C[A slow move for white.  If he's telling you that you need a stone at P2, he should be punishing you by playing P3 as in the variation.]
;B[cn]TR[bg][cg][jo][jq]C[With the marked stones in place it looked like I needed to reduce this area, but it does look risky analysing it now

Not at all!  What's risky is leaving your bottom right group to get destroyed, and leaving sente moves for white at C18 and B18.  Approaching at C6 is just fine.]
;W[cl];B[cq];W[cp]
(;B[bp]C[The joseki is to play D3 first (see variations).];W[bo]
;B[bq];W[co];B[er]C[In the game, black gets gote here, and not as strong a shape.  D3 was a nice point for black to take first (before B4).]
;W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[ln]C[W has a good moyo here, I need to do something any suggestions?


Yes: don't let white get those nice fencing-in moves in the upper left!  


At this point, M6 looks too slow.  It doesn't threaten any groups.  Your bottom right group is still in dire straits (P3!!!).  More to the point, black has a good moyo too.  White's moyo may make 50 points or so.  Black's moyo has at least that much potential.  Thus, P11 would be a good move (threatening R7).

If you're really concerned about white's moyo, you need to hane at D13 and start a fight (but then your weak upper left group may die when white plays D14).  Or, at least, find a cap or a shoulder hit.  Your move just encourages white to make a bigger moyo with K7.]
;W[ok]C[A strong move by white, defending the group below and threatening R13.]
;B[oi];W[jm]C[and indeed white replies to M6 at K7: a bad trade for black.]
;B[jj]C[This was my attempt

Too late!  You should be at K7 before white plays there (instead of M6).  But, again, you are being too jealous: white's moyo is not so huge.  You can build your own moyo.  If you play at K10 or K11, perhaps that links up to P11 and ends up making your moyo grow bigger than white's.]
;W[je]C[Obviously white is wisely concerned more with your moyo than with his own.]
;B[ke];W[kf];B[jf];W[ie];B[kd];W[jg];B[kg];W[if]C[White M14 looks scary for both sides.  White plays it safe here.]
;B[lf];W[hj]C[White made a little dent in your moyo -- probably not big enough! ... and now tries to make his moyo bigger, but there are still holes at J9 or J11 to poke into.  This is starting to look better for black.]
;B[ik];W[gl];B[jh];W[ih];B[kh]TR[ih][jh]C[given that you are going to play L12, is the marked exchange good or bad for you in terms of solidifying white's moyo and your own?  Hard to say.  I tend to think it helps white connect to H10 more than it helps you connect to K10.]
;W[nn];B[mo];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd]C[Finally someone finds those moves.  White's sente there is HUGE.]
;W[ce];B[ac]LB[ae:A]C[Next my opponent misses 'A'

Yes, but that's only seki, as I showed earlier.];W[be];B[ae]
C[Thankfully

Nonetheless, white gained a lot in sente there.  C18 was probably bigger than a lot of moves black chose to make.]
;W[df];B[cd];W[kr];B[lr];W[oq]TR[nn][mo][kr][lr]C[White should play P3 before the marked exchanges; now black has some hope of using the marked stones to help in the coming fight.]
;B[op];W[pr];B[or];W[pp];B[nq];W[pq];B[ns]C[black's whole group may die.]
;W[ll];B[mj];W[ml];B[gc]C[I was gald to get this move in, I've been thinking about it for a while

It's a big one, threatening to cut E15 too, but still your whole lower right group dying would be bigger!!]

(;W[ee];B[ge]C[Probably a bit greedy

Your lower right group should die!  But yes, given the strength of the surrounding white stones and the weakness of the two-space extension, this is too much to hope for.  Maybe if you play F18 first to support it?]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gd];B[hl];W[gm];B[ii];W[hi];B[kq]C[I thought this would help my group "weather the s=
torm"

Yes, this makes a big difference.  White should have ignored one of your last few moves to attack this group.]
;W[jr];B[id]LB[fd:A]C[Aiming at 'A'

Small!];W[mr]C[Perhaps my wanting to protect that group highlighted my fears to my opponent

Maybe.  It still looks pretty dead to me.];B[ms];W[kp];B[lp]
;W[mq]C[Now I'm in trouble];B[ko];W[jp];B[jn];W[in];B[mn];W[kn]
;B[km]
(;W[jn]C[white doesn't have to fear this ko.];B[kl];W[lm];B[nm]
;W[om]LB[nl:A]C['A' next - but I missed it by thinking too hard :-/]
;B[on];W[oo];B[nl]C[Remembered it this time though ;-)

yes, good thing white didn't play correctly either!];W[pn];B[nk]
LB[jk:B][jl:A]C[Silly - threastens nothing, 'A' would have been better, protect against the cut at 'B'


True, but there is a lot of aji for white in the area; your move takes away a lot of it (may be helpful on the right side later).]
;W[jl];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[ij];B[fd];W[he];B[fe]C[greedy :-/

which is why your earlier move at J16 was not so big.

You spent two moves now and gained nothing!  Much bigger than that seki later.]

Yes, you had many chances to avoid it.  Note that A18 is not small either, though: how many of those 6 points did you get back by playing there compared with white A18?  Since B19 is your sente, looks like that makes a 4 point difference.  So playing A18 only lost you one point compared with preventing the seki at B1 (you would have 5 points then).]

C[black needs to learn not to leave weak groups lying around.  Notice that white NEVER had a group under attack the entire game!  Black meanwhile had to save both the upper left and the bottom right ... and was lucky white didn't find more severe moves in both cases.  It is worth spending a move to make a strong group, it is worth spending a move to prevent getting walled in.

Also, don't be jealous: make sure you look at the size of your moyo before deciding where to move.  If yours is bigger, strengthen it, don't worry about reducing your opponent.  Your reducing move ended up being good because it worked with your moyo, but from your comments you weren't thinking about your own big moyo enough.]

One way or another, this result ended up horrible for black.]
