C[In this game I had not a lot of difficult.

But i had some complication into the end.



Hello reviewee ! 

That was a simple game, I liked it a lot. Full of simple mistakes, usually slow moves, and missed opportunities. Your go style is very solid. You should improve if you read sequences deeper and try to take sente more often by asking this simple question at each move : what happens if I play elsewhere ? Do I lose a lot, or only 5 or 10 points ?

Besides, be careful not to follow your opponent's moves. In the game of go, it is very important to play your game, applying your plans, and not just trying to counter the opponent's plans. 

I'm pretty confident that you will become 1 dan soon. (it is not as hard as people think)]

;B[lr];W[sr]C[Note that your wall is not perfect. P4 could become a serious cut.]
;B[pj];W[pm];B[ol];W[on]C[This part of the game was not as i especed, 'cause i had a good wall, i had a good estention in q10, but i couldn't get enough profit from this white invasion that was (i think) wrong for white in this moment. So i don't understand which was my mistake.

Babibo : Your attack is ok. I wouldn't have played it this way, but since attack is a very difficult topic, I would not take the risk to say anything. The outcome is good for you anyway. You reinforced your weaknesses during the attack, which is very important.]

(;B[sk]C[I think this is a bad move. White has only one eye, so attacking the group from K4, or K7 looks better]
;W[sl];B[sj];W[rk];B[sj];W[qn];B[rn];W[oo];B[np];W[li]C[Wrong direction. This move induces a very good move for you]
;B[jl]C[Very good.];W[io];B[fq]C[This is a bit soft. I would play on the 4th line so as to attack (I like G4)]
;W[hp];B[hq];W[gp];B[gq]C[this move is slow : the cut at G3 doesn't work. Better to play K11, or any move that saves your center group while attacking the cutting stones at O10]

(;W[dg]C[Here white tenukies... The corner can be killed. (see variation)

In fact, before playing F2, you should have made sure that you would kill the corner if white didn't answer. If not, you played a small gote move, which is a big mistake.]
;B[dj];W[dl]C[Here, you are not exactly in a position to attack, since your D10 stone feels lonely, and the L8 group is in a bad position.
 I think I would connect (see variation)]
