C[thanks in advice for your comments.

Well the first prob i can see is you lost ;)

Flick to the end to see my first impressions - hopefully it will all add up by the end ;)]

Its certainly the right area i think l16 woul dof been better.

But black already has a stone at f14 which although its pretty weak would mean i woul dprobably end up playing where you did anyway just to keep that little bit more pressure on it]
;B[kc];W[jc];B[kd]
(;W[qh]LB[ke:B][jf:A]C[that was misclick. I wanted to put it at R11

R 11 probably better but i think they are both goign to be attacked very strongly.

You ahve a lot of potential at the bottom ... you dont want the bottom right b group to squirt into that

You should also be thinking about your top left and how to develop it whilst keeping f14 useless (or beter yet make b save it  by building a rediculous moyo.) (B)

ok, but i think a move to keep your strength around k16 would be better. (A)]

how to take advantage?

Well have a plan that involves your opponent winning locally but loosing globally. Ie set up a fight that looks really severe but do not finish it off take the inituitive elsewhere and do it all over again.

there are a few questions to ask after a crappy move

1) where am I weak - you should be reading out areas before you tenuki or respond to you ropponents tenuki - if not then you are a disaster waiting ot happen. You are playing blind.

2) where am I strong - as in what groups are alive. Is your influence influence or is it a group waiting to be attacked? - nothing wrong with it being both *if* you know it nad also how to attack it if you were your oppenent. 

3) Where is my oppenent strong - ie got influence. The aim is reduce whilst forcing him to answer somewhere else so that his strength cannot pummel you

4) Where is my oponent weak? - ie a group waiting to be pummeled (NOT killed - confined or forced to run in a way that gives you useful moves on the outside. Of course your opponent may not want an amicable end and try to fight - just keep your distance and the large picture and the rest doesnt matter)

The real goal of go imo is to make moves that accomplish both of these at once. Its NOT deception its simply forcing your oppenent to do 2 things at once ... but in different areas of the board.


IE g4 is obviously weak - as is g3 ... it just depends on who moves first. But simply defending it is a crappy slow move - you were right not to play it.

You were wrong not to defend it though ... the problem is how?

Answer is attack the bottom left group in a way that will encourage b to make it live]

(;W[ji]C[i dont like this.


yes you are attacking.


but do you want to cut it now or wait to see if you can get it all?

this move works ... so dont spend it save it as a backup. If you cant get the whole lot then pounce on this ... its a good move. It jus tmight not be the best. Also saving these moves allows for you to have a whole host of really nasty stuff saved up for when you need to fight

Also if you notice it doesnt really alter the status of the group ... 

When you are attacking something you should take its space away on the edge first ie L3.


You want to make b really heavy];B[ki];W[jh];B[hp]
(;W[hq]C[must be a better move - probably by playing something earlier on.


bad shape

having to play this may well of cost you the game even though its probably the correct move.]

hehe well id disagree ... from here on in you can read a lot of it out.

B HAS to kill something or connect out.

thats a REALLY bad situation to be in for both of you.
Someone has been unreasonable in this game (answer is both of you)

the reason is that it turns the game into a game largley about reading - and i think thats a skill that you can quantify.]
;W[ni]C[how many liberties does b have?

count em (mentally)

see if we agree];B[li]C[9-10


how many do you have? answer = 4]

you are not thinking about the fight properly

your stones are really inneficient like this];B[ph]C[game over

not read anything at all];W[qi];B[pg];W[oi];B[qj]
(;W[pk]C[crap shape again

if you have to make this shape then make it good shape by gettin gb to put a stone at p9.


a driving tesuji should do the job nicley (and keep sente];B[nl]
;W[ql];B[rl]
(;W[rk]C[bad move

see what your trying to do


if you stop doing this you will be a stone stronger.

All you are doing if giving a weak b group a solid eye and then presumably droping back to defend (which removes the liberty you gained with the sacrifice)]

ok I havent viewed the game yet.

Looks like someone invaded too deep and tried to make it stick. Big capture race errupted.

So even though its a big loss its probably just a couple of moves that would totally swing the game.]

Also to be able to win with about equal libs you also need to make an eye ....


There is a book i read called fundementals of go ... everyone says its for beginners ... no chance ... its an incredibly good book.

Id recommend buying it purley for the chapters on capture races ... in fact id probably say that about several of the chapters.
