C[tetima: Hello. This is a game between me (9k at the moment, 8k now) and my 5k friend. This was played at KGS

catch22: Hi, I'll be reviewing your game. I am 3k at IGS. As I am tactically relatively strong but strategically weak, my comments mostly focus on the tactics (what are locally the best moves), and not so much on strategy (the direction of play, the best move given the whole board position, etc). I would not want to teach you any of my often flawed strategic thinking... ;-)]
;B[nn]C[tetima: I'm trying to create my own playstyle where my opneing moves are not the normal fuseki. This way i hope to disturb my opponents game when he has to think about proper moves instead of just playing some fuseki that he's learnt by heart.

Usually i open at O5 or O4.

catch22: My knowledge of joseki and fuseki is pretty poor as well, so I fully understand where you are coming from. Although a good knowledge of joseki and fuseki is necessary to become really strong, you can get a long way without it. Being able to read quickly and accurately, being skilled in fighting and recognising tesuji and appreciating good shape and efficiency is I think much more valuable than knowing many standard sequences.]
;W[qd];B[oc]C[tetima: I don't ever want to let my opponent play the P17 in this case. part of my playingstyle]
;W[ld];B[md]C[tetima: Most of my moves are of experimental nature "what would happen if..."

catch22: Nothing wrong with experimenting. It is a good way of learning. If you always only play the moves that you know well, it is harder to learn better ones.

You should still, however, always try to read out what you think is the likely outcome. This is just general good practise and should also help you to make strategically the right decisions. On top of that, you learn more that way, especially if your opponent played a strong move that you did not anticipate.]
;W[me];B[nd];W[pf];B[le]C[catch22: I like this move. It shows fighting spirit. The three Black stones at the top seem strong enough to support it.]
;W[mf]
(;B[ke]C[catch22: See the variation for a more simple (and better?) way of playing. Black catches the White stone more directly.]

(;W[jd]TR[ld]C[tetima: This was a missclick but he didn't want to undo it

catch22: The game sequence is definitely good for Black. See the variation for what could happen if White did not give up the marked stone this easily.]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[lc]C[catch22: Black should be happy with this result. The last three moves did not gain White much (if anything). Black on the other hand connected his stones, is out in the center and ended up with a strong group.]
;W[dd];B[gd];W[df];B[gf];W[he];B[ge];W[jf];B[kg];W[hg]
(;B[hf]C[catch22: The Black moves that follow are too crude.]
;W[if];B[je];W[ie];B[id];W[hd];B[ic];W[hc];B[jc]TR[mf][me]C[catch22: This result is bad for Black. Black caught two white stones, but this is hardly worth any points. More importantly, Black strengthened his group that was already strong (note that White cannot cut off Black's connection to L13, as White would lose his two marked stones if he tries), and further weakened his four weak stones. This is just the wrong way around.]
;W[ih];B[gg]C[catch22: This is not good. It invites White to play at G12, where White would like to play anyway.]
;W[gh];B[eg]C[catch22: White's stones are now quite safe, whereas Black still has to worry about his.]
;W[fh];B[eh];W[fg];B[ef];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[ed];W[fd]
(;B[de]C[catch22: Black should probably at E17 instead because this increases his liberties by two (in the game, shortage of liberties of these stones becomes a real problem), and cleanly separates White. See variation.]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[cd];B[fc];W[eb];B[cc]C[catch22: This is indeed the move to play here. A double threat.]
;W[ce];B[fb];W[gc];B[ea];W[cg];B[dg]C[catch22: This is not good. Black loses a liberty by playing here.]
;W[cf];B[ch];W[ei];B[dh];W[bh];B[ci];W[bi];B[cj];W[bj];B[ej]
C[catch22: This move is not good. It does not really gain Black anything. His stones remain short of liberties. it does not give Black an eye, nor does it threaten White.]
;W[ck]C[catch22: White is quick to punish Black.];B[dj]C[catch22: Black is forced into an awful shape. :-(]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[dp];B[fl]C[catch22: Black's last two moves are slow. He was already out into the center, so he does not gain much by this. Although it does limit White's chances to build a moyo, Black should look for more constructive and efficient moves.]
;W[il]C[catch22: However, it is not clear what White tries to achieve here either. The black stones at the left are safe now, so White should not try to attack them. Furthermore, the center is still wide open. Neither player can expect any territory here at the moment. White should now just take a big point, e.g. at the right side or at the bottom.]
;B[oh];W[qh];B[of];W[oe];B[pg];W[qg];B[pe];W[qf];B[pd];W[qc]
;B[qe]C[catch22: In a situation like this you generally should not push, unless you follow it updirectly. There are three drawbacks to a push like this: 
1) The black stones lose a liberty (in this case, after the push a White move at Q17 is sente, whereas otherwise it would not be). 
2) It limits Black's options here later in the game. 
3) Black squanders a potential ko threat. 

Furthermore, it is not urgent to push. White is unlike to play at R15 himself, as this would be gote. So Black is very likely to be able to play the push later on in the game, should he want to.]
;W[re];B[qk];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[rf];W[rd];B[mh];W[ph];B[og]
;W[pm]C[catch22: This is the start of an interesting fight at the bottom right of the board, which lasts for over fifty moves. I think both sides play pretty well, so I won't say too much about the moves that follow. I will only comment on a few moves.]
;B[ok];W[pj];B[pk];W[pp];B[qn];W[pn];B[qm];W[qo];B[oq]TR[nn]
[ok]C[catch22: This is a bit of an overplay. The Black stones are not properly connected at all. White should have no problem cutting these stones apart, and then Black has multiple groups to worry about.]

;W[nm];B[lo];W[kq]C[catch22: The situation is now a bit worrysome for Black, as he has two very weak groups to look after. White also has two groups that are not settled yet. However, these are stronger, so Whte definitely has the advantage.]
;B[lq];W[lr];B[lp];W[nl];B[nk];W[ll];B[mk];W[km];B[mi]C[catch22: At least one group is safe (for now). The five stones at the bottom are in a lot of trouble though.]

;W[jm];B[hl];W[jn]C[catch22: That should be pretty much it. The black stones at the bottom are dead, and the game should be over. Black did not really make any big mistakes in the fighting. It just seemed impossible to save them. It all started with the overplay at P3.]
;B[kl]C[tetima: This was a move i was thinking about earlier but decided to try it now

catch22: This move does not work. White should have no problem handling this.]
;W[jl];B[lm]
(;W[mm]C[catch22: This is very bad. It does not help White at all. He still has to get back to N8 to connect. This moves only "forces" an Black to become stronger. White should just play at N8 directly. See variation.]
;B[ln];W[ml];B[om];W[ol];B[on];W[pl];B[kk]C[catch22: And Black did well to exploit White's mistake. He is in the game again. There is still a chance to save the black stones at the bottom. :-)]
;W[lk];B[kj];W[lj];B[ij];W[ki];B[ik];W[li]C[tetima: Seems like my playing style is making my opponent of the balance for not playing N10

In this case, as you have three effective liberties on the outside, you can wait with this move until White fills up a liberty on the outside. It is better to first exchange G9 for B9, which gains a point in sente, and then play J19, which gains two points in gote.]

[hk][il][jl][jm][km][hn][in][jn][sq][qr][sr][rs]C[tetima: Thanks for the review

catch22: No problem. I hope you found it useful.

In summary, I think you lost the game because of a few strategical mistakes, where you gave yourself weak groups, without sufficient compensation. E.g. the push at K15 was from the wrong direction. The push through at D15 created a shortage of liberties that was difficult to handle. The placement at P3 was too early, and you let yourself be cut apart. 

On the other hand, tactically in the fighting you did pretty well. If you keep the same spirit, you should definitely be able to become a stronger player. However, before you become too involved in local fighting, you probably should sit back and think what your aim is, looking at the whole board. Furthermore, it may help to be a bit more patient. Sometimes there is a weakness in the opponent's position that cannot be exploited right away, because it doesn't quite work yet. In that case, leave the position as is and try to make use of the weakness later on in the game. Later on, for instance, you may be able to play a double-threat move that aims at two weaknesses at the same time.]
