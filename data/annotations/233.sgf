shimari here, it leaves (a) which works well with B`s san-ren-sai];B[op]

(;W[po]C[This looks normal, but I am not sure what good reply is. P5? R3?

This move by white is not in Ishida (I looked last night). I`d expect
either the variations I show or a pincer.  
I think B should attach at the 3-3 point; the variations could get
tricky, but all the ladders will tend to favour B.];B[kp]C[I don`t think  that this is good for B, the extension is too
wide and it also leaves the W all manner of forcing moves.]
(;W[mp]C[I feel  that this is a bit premature. But it`s
probably a matter of style; certainly I can`t see
a good answer for B.]
(;B[lq];W[mq];B[hq]L[pq]C[Seems like a reasonable result for  B, theres aji left in the corner.
W might consider playing (a) now.];W[iq]C[This seems premature by  W. There`s a lot of other places on the board to play.
Yes, B has a weakness but he`s only ever going to get a few points of
territory here, there`s no real room for expansion. So if W leaves the
weakness, B will always have to waste a move to patch it up.];B[ip];W[jq]

not have played this way, losing the stones now is embarassing.];W[dm];B

I`m not sure. But it`s very complex.]

;W[mm]C[W makes the best of a bad job.  B`s thickness now dominates the board.]
;B[pi]C[>Would this be better placed  on the other side?

W`s left side group is vulnerable. Yes play C10, then C4.
W will have a hard time keeping anything on the left.

At this point W needs to do something about the left side,
but B has huge moves sealing off the upper corners. Still
first he needs to play C10 or some such.];W[pj]C[Playing a contact move  is going to strengthen B.]
;B[oi];W[oj];B[nj];W[ok]C[THis sort of sequence may  take profit for W, but B`s mojo just grows.
Playing a empty triangle must be bad.];B[ni]C[>Is this too slow, or a needed  protection against the cut?

I wouldn`t protect. Just descend at R11 which must be sente then seal off the  corner.]
;W[oc]L[nc][ob][pc]C[>Not used to this 'approach'

I think this is the right direction, (a) is bad (nowhere to run)
and the 3-3 invasion probably too small.

More normal moves are (b) or (c), I`d play (c).];B[od]C[
I`d play the other way, I know it doesn`t seem to exploit the wall so well
but W will have to work quit hard to live if B keeps him from the corner.]
;W[pc];B[nc];W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[re];W[qb];B[ck]C[>premature? should I protect  with O15?

I think B should be taking as few risks as possible. I`d play
O16.];W[pe]C[But even now I think B`s actually OK.]

At this point if B can solidify the upper left side and keep W`s upper side  under control the B wins. So W needs something pretty radical.]

W`s area under control];W[je]C[I don`t think that this is a tesuji. W should  probably break into the left side
