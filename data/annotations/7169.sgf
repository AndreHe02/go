C[Hallo and thx for reviewing my game. This game I lost while I felt good which is always a bad sign. I just don't see where I lost the game. To make it easier for you I did write down some questions where I think the game went wrong, but I don't have a real clue as I said (but I hope you have :)).
----------------
Dieter Verhofstadt: Hi. I am a 2 dan in Europe so our level is not too different but a fresh opinion is always good. I think I know at least for this game what the problem is.

Your opponent made quite a few slow moves which gave you the lead in the beginning. Yet you must have thought you were behind, because you started an invasion. Having played more slowly, your opponent's forces were obviously stronger and the invasion went to his advantage. The rest of the game it remained difficult to deal with his thickness.

Therefore, I would advise to make a more thorough positional judgment before jumping to invasions. Jealousy often inspires us to think the opponent's share is bigger than ours, while it is not the case.

;W[pp];B[cd]C[akira74 [1d\]: hi];W[dp];B[ec];W[nc]C[dv: White approaches at the small side.]

;B[fq]C[dv: You keep things simple, which is good.];W[fp];B[gq]
;W[dn]LB[hq:A]TR[fp][gq]C[dv: this move is very slow, in combination with the previous one. If we omit the marked exchange, White can approach at A later and threaten to scoop away Black's base. The marked exchange throws away that possibility. Usually White will only accept such a loss if the acquired extra strength can be put to use. However, this move adds even more strength to the shape.]
;B[qn]LB[oc:1][nd:2]C[dv: throughout this stage, the exchange of 1-2 is always a plus for Black.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[qj]LB[pj:A]C[dv: It may seem a detail, but at our level it is not. I'm sure this should be played high, to build a moyo. Now Black is flat.]
;W[np]LB[kc:B][oc:1][nd:2][pj:3][dn:A][np:C]C[rs220675: So far, so good for black?

dv: Yes. All of A, B and C are slow moves by White. Black's development is faster, while not overstretched. You have better balance. As said, the 1-2 exchange and a play at 3 would have even enhanced your position.]
;B[ch]LB[oc:1][nd:2][cg:B][kq:A]TR[gq]SQ[ec][cd][dk][np]C[rs220675: For me this looks playable and as big as playing around "A". Or is there even a bigger point?

dv: the 1-2 exchange aside, this is indeed the area to play. Both White and Black have high positions on the left, from which one wants to build. At the bottom, the triangled stone discourages building. So, the bottom has lots of open space to occupy but the left side is more interesting.

Given the fact that White is extra strong on the left, I would draw back and play B instead.]
;W[pb]C[dv: too bad Black missed the opportunity to play here.]
;B[om];W[jq]LB[lq:A]TR[om]C[rs220675: Here I felt bad a little bit. Was my last marked move too slow and should I have played at white's point instead?

dv: Not at White's point but at A. Yes, I would prefer playing there

Incidendally, White extends too far here, too close to Black's solid stones.]
;B[ld]C[dv: I have to say though that your play is very consistent. You accept the losses at the bottom and the upper right, to build a moyo on the right and centre. That's a good plan.]
;W[lc];B[nd];W[oc];B[od];W[nm]
(;B[lq]C[rs220675: I just felt I need to invade. While this might be too deep or inappropriate at all I came out pretty good, so I don't think it had to do with my actual defeat.

dv: And this is the focal point, where Black goes astray. 

See the variation.];W[kp];B[nl];W[ml];B[mm];W[nn]
(;B[ll]LB[lq:A]C[dv: I feel that Black should atari the other side. White's territory will grow, but Black's moyo grows too. If you look at the variation, my calculations still give Black the advantage, although the game is not easy after the negative invasion of A.]
;W[mk]LB[ol:1][lm:3][qm:2]C[dv: Now it is White's moyo which is growing. Black's forces are spread around, not cooperating very well, with lots of cutting points.]
;B[ln];W[lk]C[dv: White happily widens the scale of the encirclement.]
;B[lp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kl];B[lm]C[dv: Black looks as if  in despair. This kind of moves must be very well calculated beforehand, otherwise everything gets caught. Were you confident to live here? I wouldn't be ... Therefore I'd rather accept the big bottom territory, build something of my own and work victory slowly. See var.]

;W[or];B[nq];W[oq];B[gm]C[dv: Black is alive. I think White let go too easily. On the other hand, White has acquired tremendous central influence.]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[oj]LB[qh:A]C[dv: White plays too close to thickness. White must use thickness to attack, for example at A.]

(;B[pi]C[rs220675: There must be a better move than that...this move cost me trouble.

dv: There is no big trouble as far as I am concerned, because White failed to attack on a large scale. But indeed, shapewise, a bump would be better. See var.]

;W[rl];B[ql];W[ol];B[rm];W[cf]C[rs220675: Here I figured I can't catch white and play it safe since white has also a lot of influence.]

C[dv: I didn't know what you were up to here. Later I saw the threat at A. It looks a bit devious.]
;W[cl];B[el];W[cj]C[dv; after all, white gets free points];B[en]
;W[gp];B[hc]C[rs220675: I felt ahead here. True?

dv: Hmmm. You are ahead in pure points, but White is very thick. We can expect the central influence to become points too. White's thickness will surely pay in the endgame.

I'd say it is a close game.];W[fc]LB[gc:A]SQ[kc][ej][fj][gj]
[hj][ij]C[rs220675: This was obviously a mess since I lost all that territory around to white which makes no sense when I have 2 own stones there. Something went wrong.

dv: If you look at all the strength White has, you should be cautious when extending. White makes very good use here of his thickness and this may well be the decisive move.

With hindsight, you should have played A in front of all that thickness]

;W[ir];B[gr];W[mh]LB[qi:A]C[dv: But with this move, White is making central territory, while the aji of the bad shape at A comes to life.]
;B[kf];W[rj]LB[fc:B][lq:A]C[rs220675: Ok, you can stop reviewing here since from now it was a dead game.

dv: agree

Conclusion: the invasion at A was where the trouble startedn because White received tremendous central power, allowing such moves as B. Instead, building your own moyo on the right and competing on size would have been better. These kind of judgments depend on your positional judgment and estimation of the score. The book by Cho Chikun is an excellent source of improvement of that skill.]
