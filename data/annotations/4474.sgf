C[Thank you for reviewing!];B[dd];W[dj];B[jj];W[kd];B[kg]C[J11 is a bigger move -- L10 plus J11 makes a perfect enclosure in the NE.]
;W[dg]C[Also stronger at J11.];B[gf];W[gj];B[hi]C[The corners are the best place to build territory, followed by the sides.  Start in the corners and don't play in the center until all the big moves on the sides are taken.  Both players could have gained a huge advantage this way.

So far, none of the corners is truly under control.  An invasion at any of C11, C3, L3, or around J11 can succeed.  G8 and H5 were way too early. D7 or G4 should probably have been closer to the sides.  White still has J11.]
;W[ee];B[df];W[de];B[ef]
(;W[fe]C[There's a proverb that says strong groups tend to get stronger.  The connection at C8 is better because it makes white's west side almost one group.  Black has to fight hard to separate them. (see variations)]

;B[ec];W[eb]C[At that time I liked my position, but later I was not yet sure anymore...

It's hard to say for certain.  White has strength and influence on the north and SW, while black has influence on the SE and west.  The NW corner isn't settled yet. (see variation)]

(;B[cj];W[ck];B[ci]
(;W[ej]C[Should I better have played on L3 here?

The timing on L3 feels bad to me.  You can live in the SE, but it puts your three stones on the south at risk.  E4 is conservative, but not a bad move.]
;B[hk]
(;W[jf]C[I had no idea. In the next moves I was trying to connect from F9 to the stones below, but B secures the whole "SE" corner.

K8 was probably misplaced.  Your four stones on the south can live easily if they secure the edge.  (see variation.)]

(;B[ie]C[You got lucky here -- black made a very bad move.

E2 would probably have won the game.  B10, M9 and B3 are not as strong, but they all gain ground.]
;W[hf]C[Good move.  The black piece is cut off from help.];B[if]
;W[ff];B[he];W[eg];B[cf];W[gg];B[hg];W[id];B[gb];W[gc]C[Good move.]
;B[gh];W[fg];B[fh];W[eh];B[bd];W[cc];B[bc];W[gk]C[Is there a way to reduce B's territory in SE?

Not really.  The 4-4 point at K4 plus H3  and L7 make a very strong enclosure.  White might be able to invade and live with a ko, but I doubt it.]
;B[gl];W[ik];B[hj]C[An error? Can the following invasion be successful?

If you think there's a chance, it doesn't hurt to try.  However, I think black is too strong.]

(;B[jk]C[This was black's mistake.];W[kj];B[ki];W[li]
(;B[lh]C[Here I had much luck, hadn't I?

Actually, I think at this point black can't stop you from living in the corner.  He made his mistake 2 moves ago.]

I don't think black can invade.  It's too easy for white to connect and form strong lines.]
;W[jd];B[ib];W[kc];B[kb]
(;W[ic]C[J11 was a mistake here -- too slow.  You need to destroy black's eyespace.  Three moves later, black made a mistake.  If he hadn't, he could have lived on the top for a difference of nearly 30 points.]

[cm][ed]C[White: 50 territories + 18 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 74.5
Black: 20 territories + 4 prisoners = 24
Result: W+50.5

Overall, this was a good game for you.  Your opening was somewhat clumsy, but you did a great job exploiting black's mistakes in the middle and end game.

Remember to establish yourself on the corners and sides before jumping out to the middle, and pay attention to the connections between your groups.  Do this and you'll see even more improvement.]
