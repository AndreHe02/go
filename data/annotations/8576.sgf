AB[ed][pd]C[I was playing with 2 handicaps and komi set to negative(-1). The result was close enough to please me, but I seek ways to improve.

I am icluding my thoughts and my questions with Q.

Reviewer: Hi, i am 9k on KGS and will review your game. I will start comments with an R.]
PL[W];W[dp];B[cf];W[pp];B[pj];W[md]C[I wanted to block the attempt of black to create a large moyo.
Q: I also considered K4 for san-ren-sei formation. Was it better?

R: I like to spread my stones over the board in the beginning. Though i would prefer o16 as an usual approach move to the corner.
k4 would look like you are trying to build a moyo yourself. But you have a disadvantage because of the handicap stones.]
;B[nc];W[mc];B[dl]C[R: You should make an extension from your 2 stones at n17 before your opponent takes the space away. j17 or j16 would make a perfect extension.]
(;W[cn]C[Q: Was C7 too risky?

R: This is better, dont attach unless u want to attack severely.]
;B[jq];W[nq];B[gq];W[hc]C[I wanted to carve out a relitively large area at to upper side.
Q: Was this idea good for black? Should I have reacted to black G3 locally?

R: Not reacting to g3 is ok, as it is a relatively local move. Your extension h17 is one step too far, it has weaknesses. j17 or maybe j 16 would have been better.]
;B[bl]C[R: This is bad by black, dont play on the second line in the beginning if not necessary.]
;W[qm];B[rj];W[qf]C[R: This is kind of risky. You go into blacks territory although black is rather strong on both sides. Even if u dont die, black can benefit by attacking u and making territory at the same time. Also your stones at the top may become weaker while black attacks r14.]
;B[qe]
(;W[rf]C[R: Better go out, q14, u might connect to the upper stones.]
;B[pf]C[R: Now black shut u in with good shape.];W[qh];B[ph]
;W[qi]C[Q: Do I have eye-space enough?

R: This looks very narrow to me, the risk of dying for white is high in my opinion. Though u hit a weak spot with r11 u can see now, q 14 would have created much more space.]
(;B[pk]C[R: Bad by black, he should have closed one of the peeps (r10 or q11).]
(;W[sd]TR[sc]C[This was one of my most questionable moves in this game. I did it as a preparation to jump in the corner.
Q: Was this a correct move? Was the idea good behind it?

R: In such a situation (s14 is one stone closer to the edge than r15) u can do a so called "monkey jump", which is one step farther away. 
You should be very careful with this now, as your group isnt alive yet. If your stones die u just added a stone to a dead group!]
;B[jj];W[lj]C[Q: Was this a good exchange for black K10?

R: I think, because of your move, this was good for black. Again u go right into blacks strength. Black can attack u and u have to run. Black can gain something while u have to fight for surviving.]
(;B[lq];W[ni]C[Q: Was this exchange good for white?

R: You kind of force black to play q11, which helps him a lot and hurts your stones on both sides. He doesnt play it anyway.]
(;B[ge];W[he]C[R: This is good for u, it creates space and tightens the loose connection to n17. Maybe j15 would be even safer.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[hg];W[ei]C[This seemed to me the focal point of the building black moyo, so I decided to invade in order to reduce.
Q: Was this a proper response to balck H13?

R: You are in the middle of blacks influence and should die. When u invade like this, u should know your options. These are usually making local life or running and connectiong to other stones. As your invading stone is on the fith line, making 2 eyes is very hard. And there is no direct way to connect to ther white stones. 
For life u would more likely invade on the third line. But here it is quite hard to invade already.]
(;B[fh]C[R: Black shouldnt, press u to the edge, he should press u into his strength.]
(;W[fi]C[R: This makes u heavy (stones are less dispensable). The more stones u connect the surer u have to be to save them!]
;B[eh];W[gi];B[gh];W[ji]C[Q: Was this extension too far, was not?

R: I think it was, black can cut u know.]
(;B[ij];W[ii];B[hi];W[hj];B[hh];W[hk];B[jl];W[ek]C[I wanted to secure the area for the two eyes.
Q: Was not this move too timid?

R: The problem is, u loose lots of moves for making 2 eyes in the middle of the board. Even if you succed black can use his moves to gain much more than u.]
;B[ci];W[el];B[dk];W[dj];B[cj];W[dm]C[R: This worked out quite well for u, but it could have been a lot worse, if black had attacked u more severely.]
;B[di];W[ej];B[eq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cr];B[ds];W[cs];B[fr];W[qc]
C[This is the jump long planned.
Q: Is not too risky?

R: You get separated and your r11 group seems to get into trouble, therefor I think this might be an overplay. You should make sure life with the r11 group first!]
;B[rd];W[rc]C[Q: Seems a bit to defensive to me, isn't it?

R: Not sure what u mean here, but without the white move, u would loose r17, I think.]
;B[se];W[sc];B[re];W[sf]
(;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qa]TR[ra][sa][qb][rb][sb]C[R: The corner should die, too. The shape is called the bulky five and s18 is its vital point.]
(;B[mo]C[R: The upper left corner is rather big.]
(;W[hm]C[Q: Is not this move too timid?

R: I guess there are bigger points on the board like the upper left corner.]

;B[of];W[qj]C[My intention was to separate to black stone from the group.
Q: Does not this move overconcentrate white?

R: You should desperately fight for life, if u see a chance here. Overconcentration is not your problem.]

C[R: This doesnt achieve anything. You shouldnt try to cut a bamboo joint (two stones facing two stones) as it is pointless. Unless u want to reduce liberties. But here the group is alive already.]

(;W[ap]C[Done after a long consideration, I thought it to be good move.
Q: Are there any better choces?

C[Q: Was this the proper move?

R: I think its fine. better loose a few points than the whole territory. But as u can see, j14 was more important than other points u played first.]

C[R: I dont think this is good. See variation.]

Q: Was the really important?

R: You didnt save it, it is dead. It doesnt cost u a point, as black has to respond, but its just not necessary.]
