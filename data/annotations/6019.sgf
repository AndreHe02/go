AB[pd][dp]C[Daedin: Hello,

I am Daedin on KGS, coming from France.

If I could give you one advise on the game, it would be to try and see what are the strong and weak groups at any time on the board. Strong groups are fine left alone - the opponent cannot gain anything by attacking them - while weak groups need to be taken care of. If the opponent can attack one of your weak groups, he will very likely gain more than you will during the attack.

One last piece of advise is regarding reviewed games like this. To get the most out of a review, the best thing is first to analyze the game yourself. By analyzing, I mean to try variations (with commentaries) on situations where you felt you - or your opponent - did badly, try and find key moves - good and bad - explain your choice when playing otherwise on the board, etc.

By doing this, the reviewer will not only be able to focus on more specific parts of the game, he will also be able to analyze and comment your strategy and your way of thinking - which is not less important than the technique itself.

I hope you will find my commentaries useful.];W[qp];B[dc];W[dj]
C[Daedin: There is a go proverb that says : "The corner is gold, the side silver, and the center desert". The idea behind this proverb is that it is much more easier to make territory in the corners, then on the sides, and very difficult in the center.

This is why it is more usual to either defend the corner (with P4 for instance) or to attack the opponent's corner to prevent them from securing territory there (with C15 for instance).]
;B[cn]C[Daedin: It is more common to enclose from the komoku (D17) first, for instance with C15 or C14. The reason is that with a shimari (corner enclosure) from the komoku, you only need two moves to secure the corner. 

With C6, Black needs another move at E3 to protect the corner.]
;W[jd]
(;B[gc]C[Daedin: In the same line of thought as mentioned before, it is more usual to defend the corner first with C15 for instance.]

(;W[md]C[Daedin: N16 is a bit vague: too far from the Q16 stone to attack it, and too high (on the fourth line) to make a base to live. The white group is becoming a target for Black to attack.]
;B[qf];W[qj];B[nc];W[mc]LB[qc:A]C[Daedin: The O17 - N17 exchange is bad for Black. It has helped strenghten White's group, while the corner is still open at A.

I would have played either P17, both to secure the corner and aim at a move around N18 to deprive White's group from its base.

See variation for examples of White invasion (there are many more possible variations, but basically the idea is that White can live, at least thanks to a ko).]

(;B[nd];W[jp];B[gq]C[Daedin: Same as before, the corner is not secure yet.]
;W[hq]
(;B[fq]C[Daedin: H4 is more severe, and White cannot hope to gain much by crosscutting and trying to pick a fight in the area - he has too many weak groups to do so.]
;W[dg];B[oq]C[Are the moves 18 to 24 o.k. or are there other, more important moves?

Daedin: The idea behind 18 is corrent: it attacks the corner while separating the two white stones on the left. However White is very strong in the vincinity, so the fight will be difficult for Black.

Another idea could be to attack first the D13 White weak stones]
;W[nq]C[Daedin: This is a very unusual move. Contact play like this causes both groups to strenghen, and thus is seldom used as an attacking move.]

(;B[op]C[Daedin: Seems ok, since it separates the two White groups.]
;W[pn]
(;B[no]C[Daedin: This looks a bit mild. The White group at the bottom is weak, so the goal would be to attack it. To do that however, Black first needs to strengthen its own group. This is usually done by attacking / attaching to the stronger group, namely the group on the right.]
;W[mp];B[nm]C[Daedin: Now Black has a weak group running to the center, while White's bottom group looks rather solid. Black hasn't gained much in the attack.]
;W[pl]
(;B[ll]C[Daedin: It is painful for Black to run while gaining nothing. Maybe putting some pressure on the bottom White group firt to strengthen Black could be an alternative.]
;W[hg];B[ce]C[Daedin: Big. However the Black center group is more urgent (urgent moves before big ones).]
;W[cf];B[de];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic]
(;B[fc];W[fe];B[ck]C[Daedin: There is a saying that states : "never play a diagonal move under an ennemy stone on the third line". It strengthens White while Black gains nothing.]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[bj];B[aj];W[ai];B[ak];W[bh];B[bf];W[bg];B[df]
;W[cg];B[af];W[ag];B[be]C[Daedin: All these move are yose moves, that means that they should be kept when the status of all groups is decided. In the game, the Black center group is not alive yet, so it should first be taken care of.]
