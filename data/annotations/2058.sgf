;AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I started learning Go on Aug.10, and consider myself a 30kyu player, hence the handicap. I have managed to beat GnuGo three times before, but today I lost.]
;W[dm];B[cn]C[I just read on Richard Bozulich's "The second Book of Go" that on high handicap games, black should attack, rather than defend, so here I go. I used to leave this situation and start extending on my previous games, but I decided to give as little space as apossible to my opponent.]
;W[pg];B[qf]C[And again...];W[gd];B[fc]C[And again...];W[mp]
;B[nq]C[And again...];W[fp];B[ep]C[Trtying to defend, since I'm being attacked on both sides.]
;W[hp];B[ip]C[And again...];W[gm];B[im]C[Here I'll try to confine White to the smallest territory possible. I'm already thinking if it wouldn't have been a better idea to be defending from the start.

In high handicap games it is always a good idea to attack white from the beginning on. Playing defensively means to give white the initiative.]
;W[pn]
(;B[pl]C[Looking back, I guess this is a bad move. Ishould have gone for S5 instead, securing the corner a bit more, but I went for the side.

> S5 whould be not only better in terms of securing the corner but makes it very difficult for white to get a base on the third line. White's stones on Q6 will be floating. Therefore, q8 is passive. In addition, this additional pincer is not necessary as you hoshi stone on q10 is already a pincer.]
;W[nd];B[dg]TR[cc]C[Here I decided to ignore White's attack, extending on what I thought would be a large portion of the side and upper left corner.

> You build a large moyo (sphere of influence) on the upper left side but it isn't territory yet. White can still invade it on the 3,3 point for example.]

[gj][jj][cl][im][cn][dp][ep][ip][jp][dq]SQ[el][dm][gm][fp][hp]
[eq]C[> White tries to build eyespace for its group here. The available space is already limited by your surrounding groups. What you should do is to confine white white attacking this group. Good moves are g10 and c8. G10 is probably the best as it also connects your tengen stone (k10) to the left side while preparing an attack on the lonely White stone on g16.]

(;B[fq]C[> See comment previous move];W[gq];B[er];W[gk]
(;B[gj]C[> Try to remember whenever you attach to a weak stone you make this stone strong]
;W[il]TR[im][ip][jp]C[> There's a proverb which says: if you're attached then bend around (hane). Your 3 marked stones are threatened to be cut off from the center and captured by white. So I think you shoud hane and try to connect them to your tengen stone (k10).]

(;B[ce]TR[ce]C[> Try not to play an empty triangle unless it is necessary. Play c14. It is better than your move because you give white the possibility to take away a big chunk of you territory on the left side.]
;W[gf]
(;B[bc]TR[jd][jf]SQ[gd][nd][gf]C[> Wrong direction: don't go for the corner. There's something more urgent on the board. Look at your marked black stone and the surrounding white stones. It is outnumbered 3:1.  White might want to to try to cap your stone and to connect his three stones. So it is better if try to keep them separated by playing k15 instead. The two marked white stones on the left side will have difficulties to make two eyes.]
