C[P : Hi jason, my name's Peter. I'm 7 or 8k. I started go a few years back, and have been playing and studying in a fairly dedicated way for about a year. This is my first game review with gtl, so I'd appreciate any comments you have about the review, as well as any questions you have about my interpretation of your game. At the end of the review, I rattle on for a little while with some general ideas about the game.
First off, I can tell from your comments that you have been studying some go theory and that what you are learning is advising your play. That's great! Theory's useful, but the challenge is always to make it a part of the way ou approach things during a real game.
 You probably already know about sensei's library. In the comments I give, I'll be suggesting some topics and theories that might interest you, all of which you will find some information about over at sensei's.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[cp];B[ip]LB[eq:A][kp:B][lp:C]C[[jasonolson\] I thought that this was a bad move, that black was over-stretching too far. I wasn't sure how to respond though. I could have simply defined my corner with A, or split black with B or C. Since I was unsure, I decided to go elsewhere.

P : bj4 is not unheard of, but it is uncommon and is often considered an overplay, meaning it reaches further than is actually useful. Therefore, in this case it can be considered as prioritizing influence.
 You were right not to play b or c, as black's response would be to enclose the lower right corner, leaving white to fight towards the centre while black builds up strength. If white wanted to enclose the lower left corner, e4 is better than e3, getting him a little higher up to combat black's influence.]

(;W[qf]C[P : As black here, I would ignore this white's stone for now and play q5.
In the ishi press book, 'In the beginning', the author suggests first taking corners, then dealing with enclosures, then extending, then addressing other concerns. Approaching the stone at q16 is not the best move at this point. 
A stone on the 4-4 point (such as q16) is a stone played with centre influence in mind, as the corner territory can always be taken by a stone played behind it at the 3-3 point. In fact, it would take two more plays for black to secure the top right corner, so white's approach is perhaps premature. 
I would suggest the approach at r5 instead. There is a proverb that states that area in front of an enclosure (shimari) is valuable. If black were to have enclosed that corner before white eventually made the r5 approach, the stone at j4 would look a lot stronger and an invasion there would be more difficult. 
White could also play the high approach at q5, aiming to play somewhere between black's two stones on the lower side.]

(;B[jd]C[P : Although it is played fairly often, Black's move here is not joseki, being too far away from the corner stone to be of much use, and leaving the upper side open to a second approach, which is just what white goes on to do. n17, 016, q14, or q11 are the usual joseki moves. Included are some simple variations.]
;W[hd]C[P: Good calm response. It makes the enclosure of the top left very valuable, and makes the k16 stone vulnerable.]
;B[jj]C[[jasonolson\] Was a little shocked by this move.

P : Yep, that's a surprise. An extension from k16 towards the centre is the right idea, but this is a bit much, with the board still open everywhere...
A bit of general wisdom around playing against stones at tengen (the centre point). Tengen is not often played in the opening these days because it is not associated with any territory and only really becomes useful during fighting that spills towards the centre. So, when playing against an opponent who plays at tengen, it is important to try and keep the fighting contained. If you manage to do that, you will usually win.]

(;W[md]TR[pd]C[[jasonolson\] My aim was to split black's top and to isolate black's marked corner stone (and perhaps take the corner at a later time).

P : You have the right idea, for sure.
 White seems to have wanted to put equal pressure on the two black stones on the top side. However, n16 is too far away from the corner stone, allowing black to comfortably play 017 next and, as happens later, push out towards the centre while you need to spend moves to live.  See the first variation.
White was probably wary of giving black enough room to make a comfortable extension from the k16 stone. However, white would welcome this extension, as black would have violated the proverb against playing contact plays on weak stones. This would allow white to build up strength while black struggles. See second variation. (Second variation starts the same as the first one, branches on black's move)]
;B[nc];W[nd]TR[qf]LB[mf:A][oe:C][of:B]C[[jasonolson\] Rather than jumping out to A, I felt that playing O-16 allowed me to connect to the marked white stone. However, this is too far in hindsight. Black could sever my stones by playing at B or C leaving my two stones with out a base (and in big danger of survival).

P : You analysis of this situation is right on. 
The terms used to describe w016 here and a posisble wn15 are Heavy and Light. Light play is loose and versatile, keeping options open and not placing too much importance on particular stones and configurations. Heavy is to have to many stones in one place that can be cumbersome and easily attacked, as happens here.
Spending an evening learning about heavy and light play will increase your strength by two stones (it definitely did for me!).]
;B[oc]C[Black makes a docile, submissive, heavy move.]
(;W[ng]C[[jasonolson\] Jumping out and trying to connect to the right side, further isolating black into the corner.

P: Good instincts, correct direction of play (if you aren't familiar with the term 'direction of play' check it out on sensei's). I like it better at p14 though, where it would definitively connect the two stones on line 16 to the r14 stone, as well as sealing black into the corner. 
White's ogeima (large knight's extension) here from r14 to 013 is not a solid connection in light of black's strong position. Black manages to attack this weak connection several times throughout the rest of the game, ultimately killing the group r14 is part of. 
I'm sure you know this but it doesn't hurt to restate it -- maintain connections and make them carefully. It will avoid fleeing and making honte or gote moves later on.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[og];B[qe];W[rf];B[re]C[p : You played calmly and steadily, allowing black to play p14 q14, which are fairly useless (if the next move supports the line 16 stones), while you build a wall.
To support the line 16 stones, white might, for instance, a play at L15 or n17, each of which force the k16 stone to flee while also increasing your strength. Check out some possible variations on the next move (They are just general ideas).]

(;W[qo]TR[qf][rf]LB[qg:A]C[[jasonolson\] I wasn't worried about the cut at A because I thought I could capture in a ladder. I hadn't realized that this wasn't the case though as the two marked stones would be captured. Since I thought the cut at A was defended, I decided to claim some more territory.

P : The cut at A is weak, but it is not urgent to defend it -- check out the variation on the next move where black makes the cut. 
R5 is a good move for sure, very big and working in excellent conjunction with the wall as well as reducing black's ability to make territory on the bottom. However, one must make urgent moves before big moves, and it is urgent to protect white's line 16 stones]

(;B[pn]C[[jasonolson\] Wasn't expecting such a close pincer. But I figured I could still easily make life in the bottom corner. Rather than fighting Q-6 directly, I felt making a base would be better.

P :An uncommon move by black. Itseems quite weak.  Probably the best move for black would have been o4, following the proverb to play away from thickness without being too passive.]

(;W[qn]LB[rk:C][rl:B][rq:A]C[[jasonolson\] Preparing to jump at A, B, or C in order to make a base and live.

P : Your thinking about making a base and living at the bottom is smart and represents good instincts and a knowledge of how to settle your groups.  It's not a bad move, but personally I like the fight better.  Check out the variation.]
;B[qm]
(;W[rm]C[P : This move is also submissive. White should not allow himself to be pushed down close to the edge when black's position is so weak.]
;B[pm];W[rq]C[[jasonolson\] making a base to live.];B[qp];W[rp]
;B[rl];W[sm]
(;B[po]TR[rp][rq]LB[rn:B][ro:A][sl:C]C[[jasonolson\] Not worried about cuts at A or B as I can capture either because of the liberty at C (and connection with labeled stones).

P : True enough. One of the most important things to know in this game is when your groups are safe and when they're not.
 However, this result is quite bad for white. while white lived small on the side, black built up huge thickness towards the centre and largely cancelled out the influence of white's wall higher up, making a strong wall into a weak group.
From your comments, it sounds like throughout this exchange, you were mostly worried about simply living, choosing t play defensively, when you really should have been on the attack -- there's a proverb that says use thickness to attack, which you were doing when you played the approach r5. You had sente going into the exchange, but gave it up after black's first move against your approach by immediately going on the defensive. For more information about this sort of thing, there are some good articles on sensei's about 'fighting spirit' (there's a japanese word for that that's more commonly used that I can't remember).]
;W[qq]LB[pr:A]C[[jasonolson\] Threatening to move at A in order to secure eye-space and take corner.]
;B[pp];W[pr]C[At this point, since white's group is alive, it would have been best for white to take sente to a larger point elsewhere.]
;B[sl]TR[rm][sm]LB[rn:A]C[[jasonolson\] Takes vital liberty away from marked stones and threatens to cut at A

P : This is a strange move for black to make. Perhaps s/he was hoping you would not notice? If that's the case, it's a bad move and a waste of a ko threat. Or perhaps s/he did not want your group to sneak out and connect to the wall higher up. If that's the case it's premature, the white corner group is alive and the wall above wall has not yet come under attack.
You could choose to ignore this move, sacrifice the two marked stones, and break out into the bottom instead. See the variation on the next move.]

(;W[rn]LB[so:A]C[[jasonolson\] Prevent cut and can make two eyes to live by playing at A

P : See the variation for another possibility that I feel is stronger.]
;B[or];W[ps]LB[oq:A][os:B]C[[jasonolson\] Can't play at A as it is captured in a ladder. In hindsight, perhaps should have played at B in order to threaten to break out of corner and to gain one more piece. Q-1 is a safe move, but perhaps too slow.

P : You're right, safe but slow. in fact, the white plays at r3, q2, and q1 were all too slow. There's a concept in go called ambient temperature that talks about the'hotness' of the board. Hotness means, more or less, the size of the moves available. The board is still very hot, with many huge points open to both players, such as e4 and c15 and d10. WHite's last few moves would be better played once the board cools down a little bit, as the group was able to live without them, using sente now for one of the big points.]
;B[oq]
(;W[pj]TR[ng][og][pg][rl][sl]LB[ql:A]C[[jasonolson\] Not only jumping from marked white stones and defining more of the right side, but also threatening to cut at A since the move at Q-10 is a ladder breaker. If not caught, cutting at A with the ladder breaker at Q-10 would also potentially allow me to capture black's marked stones.

P : If you wanted to, you could have just made the cut. The ladder doesn't work. Take a look a the variation -- there's a bit of talk about how to use the aji of ladders in it.

It would be best though to make a larger move somewhere else and leave the cut for later. Any move on the left side is larger than the cut, so black would probably respong (or else let you make a second large move) so you can come black and make it later.]
;B[ok]C[[jasonolson\] Good move for black. Negates the ladder breaker at Q-10, though I didn't realize it at the time.

P : It also builds black's moyo and presses on white's group there, making restricting options and beginning the attack.]
;W[ql]C[[jasonolson\] Bad move on my part. I hadn't realized that black P-9 enabled the ladder again.

P : It happens. the most viewed professional game on go4go involves the misreading of a ladder -- to hilarious and disastrous results.
The important thing is that you recognized that your group in the top right was threatened and made moves to defend it. It's not always easy to realize when your groups become weak, especially if your focus has moved to another part of the board.]
;B[qk];W[pl]C[[jasonolson\] Once again, ladder's broken since he can turn the corner and capture. These are all wasted moves.]
;B[pk];W[ol]C[[jasonolson\] Here's where I noticed the ladder being broken since it "bends" around the corner.]
;B[nl]C[P : All of this has left the q10 stone high and dry, and the group on line's 13 and 14 eyeless. A tough spot to be in.]
;W[eq]C[[jasonolson\] Securing corner and threatening to come out to the bottom

P : Very good. 
It's these sort of moves that allow you to win the game. For the rest of the game, you play every big point.]
;B[dj];W[ce];B[mc]C[P : Extremely slow.];W[ld];B[lc];W[kd]C[[jasonolson\] I didn't mind "staying ahead of the race" in order to exert greater influence into the center.]
;B[kc];W[je]LB[ke:A]C[[jasonolson\] Not worried about cut at A since it is easily captured in ladder.]
;B[ke];W[id]LB[kf:A]C[[jasonolson\] Didn't do ladder at A because I felt I could threaten with J-16. This allows me to eventually secure top-left corner even more.]
;B[jc];W[kf]C[[jasonolson\] capturing in ladder. no moves beyond this necessary unless black runs...]
;B[le]
(;W[me]C[P : I prefer the basket capture here. Black can't escape, and the two groups are joined.]
;B[ic];W[hc]C[[jasonolson\] I felt top left territory is looking great. Between that, lower left and the right side, I believe white is in pretty good shape on territory.

P : Ya, white's looking great. All of his moves have been much larger and more effective than black's for the last while.]
;B[jf];W[lf]LB[ie:A]C[[jasonolson\] In hindsight, perhaps playing at A is better for white. This capturing can still be done later. By not playing at A, black can play at A instead of seperate white's top left from center.

P : The two black stones could have escaped if you hadn't made the capture.]
;B[ie];W[ke]C[[jasonolson\] Connecting. Still not worried as my stones are fine since I can still connect to the right and make a second eye there.]
;B[jg]
(;W[ch]LB[if:A]C[[jasonolson\] Claiming more territory. Can't cut at A because it would be captured in ladder.

P : This move is definitely the right idea. however, it could have been better placed.
  the extension would have been better made from the shimari at the bottom, making the largest, most secure territory possible.  variation.

The ladder is a bit more complicated than it appears. See the second variation.]
;B[nf];W[mh]LB[lg:A][mf:B][mg:C]C[[jasonolson\] I was originally thinking this move would connect my top group to the group on the right side. However, this doesn't connect as it allows black to separate the two groups by playing at A followed by B. Instead move 74 should have been at C. Then if black plays A, white plays B, or vice versa. If black separates these two groups by playing at A->B, then the top stones are dead.

P : Ya, that's unfortunate. Shit happens, and this way, you get to practice dealing with difficult situations.
One of the reasons I don't play online much is because the timer gets to me and I make poor judgment calls, like this.]
;B[lg];W[kg]C[[jasonolson\] At this point, I knew the top group was in trouble, so my only hope is to keep on running to try connect to the left group.]
;B[lh];W[kh];B[li];W[jh]LB[ig:A]C[[jasonolson\] Threatening to play A, killing black's stones and connecting top stones to left groups.]
;B[ig];W[ih]TR[ig][jf][jg]LB[hg:B][hh:A]C[[jasonolson\] Continuing to run left to connect to safety. If black playes hane at A, white can cut at B, killing back's marked stones.]
;B[hh];W[hg]TR[ig][ih][je][jf][jg][jh][kd][ke][kf][kg][kh][ld]
[lf][md][me][nd]C[[jasonolson\] White's marked stones are now safe since black's marked stones are dead.

P : Nicely done. You out read your opponent.];B[mg]LB[nh:A]
C[[jasonolson\] Threatening to cut at A

P : This is a pretty pointless move by black. It would be best to ignore it and take sente to quickly settle your group.]

(;W[nh]TR[ig][jf][jg]LB[mf:A]C[[jasonolson\] Preventing cut (since no need to capture black's marked stones (they're not going anywhere yet)). Contemplated playing at A but figured separating black's two groups won't do much compared to what white will lose if allowing black to cut at O-12.

P : Your group of stones there can no longer run towards the centre is in big trouble if black plays under it, at s11 or somesuch point.  Connecting that cut doesn't really do anything to make it better, and is allowing black to dictate the direction of play. White needs to get control of eyespace there before black does. This variation is one idea.]
;B[mf];W[qc]C[[jasonolson\] Trying to live in the corner starting at 3-3, further reducing black's territory.

P : Haha, well done on the 3-3 invasion. As a general rule, it's impossible for a 3-3 invasion to survive behind the black stones present, sometimes called 'the three crows'. But good for you for making it work anyway. If you're interested, here's a variation (on the next move) for how black could have prevented that.]

(;B[qd]C[P : Kindof a silly move black. Variation.];W[rc];B[pc]
;W[pb]C[[jasonolson\] Trying to make enough room for two eyes in the corner.]
;B[ob];W[pa]
(;B[oa]C[P : Black could play s19 here for the chance to kill white in ko, which would probably happen as black has many more ko threats at this point.]
;W[ra]LB[qb:A][rb:D][sb:C][sc:B]C[[jasonolson\] Preventing black cut at A, allowing white to make two eyes. If Black plays B instead, white plays C and makes two eyes with D.

P : The vital point! Haha! You are a go pirate! Plundering where your foe thought they were most secure.]
;B[sb]TR[qc][rc]LB[rd:B][sc:A]C[[jasonolson\] White just captures at A. If black had stone at B before this incursion, the story would be completely different (because of the reduction of liberties on white's marked stones).

P : If black had played at B, white would still have been fine, playing s18 or something.]
;W[sc]TR[sb]C[[jasonolson\] Capturing black's stone and able to make two eyes, giving life.]
;B[rb];W[qb];B[sd]C[P : Black declines to take sente in compensation.]
;W[dl]TR[rb][sb]LB[rd:A]C[[jasonolson\] No need to capture black's stones until black atari's with A. So, this move claims more of the left side as well as "squeezing" black's stone at D-10.

P : Excellent move, great bit of playing. You take a huge point now while black's marked stones die in gote. Normally, if your stones are going to die, at least you get sente in compensation. Search 'death in gote" on sensei's for a laugh.]
;B[rd]LB[fj:A][lq:B]C[[jasonolson\] This move assumes that white forgets he's in atari. Black would be better served playing elsewhere. Perhaps escaping his squeezed stone by playing A, or securing territory with B?

P : You're right, black should play elsewhere. However, black could still do those things afterwards, as this move is kikashi. Kikashi is a forcing play that can usually only be answered in one way, leaving the player of kikashi with sente afterwards. This move is just a waste of a ko threat, but check out kikashi on sensei's. It's a great technique to master.]
;W[sa]C[[jasonolson\] Forced to capture...];B[os]TR[pr][ps]
LB[qr:A]C[[jasonolson\] Threatening to cut at A, capturing marked stones.

P : Black wastes another ko threat.  You could ignore this move and go  elsewhere. You respond at r2 though, a move that is much cooler than the ambient temperature.. Black capturing those stones is worth six points -- two stones captured, two points of black territory, white's territory reduced by two. However, there are still points worth much more around. This could be an opportunity to take sente to help your upper right group, or to play f10, likely killing the black d10 stone.]
;W[qr]C[[jasonolson\] Connecting, preventing cut.];B[qg]
(;W[rg]C[P : Black should have started this attack from the other side, playing on the 11th line. Black's error leaves white a chance to live, but white's response at s13 dooms it, unfortunately.  s13 can lead only to a capturing race, the only possible outcome of which is death for white.
Reading more than a few moves ahead is very difficult, but it does come with practice and is the single most valuable skill for improving your game. One way to do that is to solve go problems -- practice thinking about the problems without placing stones on the board, rather visualize them. It's a good habit to get in to.
Here's one way white could live. there may be others];B[qh]
;W[rh];B[qi];W[qj];B[ri]TR[mh][ng][nh][og][pg]C[[jasonolson\] White's stones are now dead in this capture race. Even worse though, white's marked stones are VERY close to being dead (if not dead already) because there is no longer eye space to live (and nowhere to run to.]
;W[rj]TR[qf][rf][rg][rh]C[[jasonolson\] Pointless move. The marked stones are already dead. Should be trying to save other stones (if even possible).]
;B[sh];W[rk]TR[rl][sl]LB[om:A]C[[jasonolson\] Another pointless move. "Hoping" black forgets to capture at A so white can capture marked stones and make eyes.]
;B[om];W[pi];B[sg];W[ph];B[sf];W[oj]C[P : Black does not need to respond to this right away, although responding does remove the aji. On the next move there's a variation for how thing's go if black tenuki.]

(;B[nj]TR[mh][ng][nh][og][oj][pg][ph][pi][pj][qj][rj][rk]C[[jasonolson\] No way to make two eyes now. At the time, I assumed marked stones are now dead.

P : Yup, that's one dead group.];W[hq]TR[ip][mh][ng][nh][og]
[oj][pg][ph][pi][pj][qj][rj][rk]C[[jasonolson\] Since I assumed marked stones are dead, I need to start capturing more territory fast to make up for it. This move captures more territory and threatens to cut "under" the black marked stone, claiming even more territory at the bottom.

P : Yup, good thinking, good move. White also needs to think about how to break up black's huge moyo in the centre, but working to keep your own territory larger is a good strategy. In spite of the loss of your group, I think you're still ahead.]
;B[iq]
(;W[hr]LB[ir:A]C[[jasonolson\] Helping secure the corner. Didn't hane at A because it didn't feel like good shape to hane at the top of black's stones when my shape would be so weak.

P : Right idea, wrong direction. This move would be better played towards the centre at h4. It enlarges territory, increases influence, and strengthens the h3 stone to protect the corner. the hane for black underneath is tiny in comparison. See variation.]
;B[ir]C[P : Better move for black would be h4, allowing white in underneath, but solidifying the centre territory while pressing down on white's framework.]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[go]C[[jasonolson\] Futhering securing territory in corner. Here though, I'm thinking that I need to find a way to infiltrate the center territory black is starting to secure.]
;B[hn];W[fl]TR[dj]LB[fj:B][hl:A]C[[jasonolson\] Threating to jump to A and split black's stones in two (and reducing black's center influence). If black defends at A, also threatens to jump to B, effectively killing black's marked stone since there would be no space to live.

P : Ya! Good move!];B[gk]
(;W[fk]TR[dj]LB[hl:A][hm:B]C[[jasonolson\] Continuing to threaten to kill black's marked stone. Also keeps white's options at A and B open to break into black's center.

P : This move is a little too slow. It allows black to get f10, which leads to the fight in the centre.
 Consider the variation.];B[fj]
(;W[ej]TR[dj]C[[jasonolson\] Continuing to kill of black's marked stone.

P : This move is a mistake. Playing directly into the cut like that allows black to answer at e11, then take sente when you have to draw back to protect you stone. You could cut later, but it opens up your large top left territory as well.
Better to play the peek at e11. variation];B[ei]LB[di:A][ek:C]
[fi:B]C[[jasonolson\] If black defends at A, white can cut at B. If black defends at B, white can cut at A. So for now, just extend and connect at C.

P : True, but it lets black make the decisions and decide how the fight is going to go.]
;W[ek];B[di]
(;W[gl]TR[di][dj][ei]LB[gj:A]C[[jasonolson\] Threatening double atari at A and allowing white to break out into the center. At this point, I felt it was more important to reduce black's center potential than to kill black's marked stones, since the marked stones aren't really gaining black any territory.

P : Bluntly, I don't like this move. I appreciate that you put in a detailed comment here to explain your thinking though. 
I don't think that some access to the centre is, at this point, more important than the death of the marked stones. If they live, your top left territory is wide open and will be decimated, while the bottom area will be reduced as well. It works for you though, but that's more due to black not mounting a meaningful defence of the centre. I prefer to cut at A immediately. see variation.]
;B[gi]C[P : Black defends all cuts, is safe.];W[hi]C[P : I'd be curious to hear what you were going for with this move -- it doesn't really seem to address what's going on. If I were black, I'd respond as in the variation on the next move.]

(;B[hj];W[gh]C[P : Perhaps this move would have been better played as kikashi at f12, working to secure your territory.]
;B[ii]C[P : This move is sort fo silly, resolving to fight over a meaningless stone. Better to jump in at e13, costing white twenty points.]
;W[hk]TR[hi]LB[hh:A]C[[jasonolson\] Didn't connect at A as I was thinking this move would help white break into the center (and I was willing to sacrifice marked stone in order to break into center and reduce black's center potential).

P : Good thinking. However, it would have been best at this point to simply enter the centre at j8.]
;B[hh];W[gj];B[hi]LB[fi:A]C[[jasonolson\] Forces black to connect at A and allows white to break into center.]
;W[gk];B[fi];W[hm]C[P : This is kindof a weird move. If you wanted to jump into the centre, why not jump into the centre?]
;B[gg]C[ P : The coming sequence is very painful for white. In a comment on move 155 you say you're not very good at 'cutting battles'. It's best not to engage in them. There's a proverb that says, build territory along straight lines. This is to avoid cutting points and to settle areas once and for all. After black made this move, I would suggest this variation.
Later on, you ask if there was a way to play that would have saved the corner territory and broken into the centre. I believe that to do that, it would have been best to avoid all the ataris that went on around the weak black stones. Better to play solidly and build strong lines -- thickness -- then use that thickness to attack. Move 142 set you on the path to losing your territory here, attempting to capture stones rather than playing to secure territory. Allowing the black group to become heavy trying to live while you sealed up huge territories would have been very sweet indeed. Check out some of the alternatives I proposed earlier on in this fight.]

(;W[if]C[P : Variation];B[fh];W[gf];B[ff];W[he];B[ge]C[[jasonolson\] I'm not very good at these outright cutting battles. Is there a way I could play differently to better secure my territory/potential?

P : I addressed several comments a few moves back, but I'll restate. Try and build territory along straight lines. These sort of cutting and wrapping around fights only really happen among beginners. Not to say you're a beginner, because you're not, but your play in this battle didn't have the same sort of calmness and clarity to it as it did in other parts of the board. Go is a psychological game. Perhaps you were shaken up by the loss of your group on the right side and became desperate, playing too forcefully. If you timer allows it, try and give yourself breaks while playing, a moment to sip some water, close your eyes, and reassess the situation in the context of the whole board. You were ahead on territory going into this exchange and needed only to seal up the territory you already had, but instead hasty play cost a lot of space.
Please don't take my comment as disparaging. Quite the contrary, I'm really impressed by your play throughout most of this game.]
;W[hf]C[P : It would have been best to sacrifice this stone and play f15, beginning to confine the invasion.]
;B[fe]C[[jasonolson\] At this point, I'm realizing I gave up too much corner territory in order to break into center. Is there a way I could have played in order to achieve both goals (securing corner as well as breaking into center)?

P : I spokle to this a bit a few moves back. If you want to have some more dialogue about this sequence, send me an email and I'd be glad to talk more.

 I find that in games where I win, I'm not critical enough of my own tactics, not asking the sort of questions you ask above, which is the path to learning.]
;W[fc]C[P : Good.];B[ed];W[ec];B[dd];W[cd];B[ci];W[bh]LB[bi:A]
C[[jasonolson\] I felt this secured the top left territory. Didn't want to hane at A, as I wasn't sure how it would play out if black responded with the cut here at B-12.

P : Ya, the hane would have ended badly, you're right.];B[bi]
C[P : this is a poor move. It does not have any effect on territory. Black should have jumped in at b9 if s/he wanted to continue invading.]
;W[eg]LB[fg:A]C[[jasonolson\] Peaking at A. If black doesn't connect at A, white plays here, cutting off black's upper-left stones, more than likely killing them in the process.

P : Good move. This is a good example of kikashi, a forcing play that can only be answered one way. However, one of the important things about kikashi is that kikashi stones should be treated as light and disposable. Your next move is to play back at d13, which is heavy. The purpose of a kikashi stone is to make your opponent go around it in order to get where tehy want to be, which in this case is into the gap around c13. The kikashi stone prevents that in sente and doesn't need to be supported.]
;B[fg];W[dg];B[df];W[cf];B[dh];W[fd]C[P : This move is very slow. Better to start your invasion of the centre now, as black could ignore this move and defend against it.]
;B[ee];W[de]C[P : Also very slow, but again, black's response is slower.]
;B[ef];W[cg]C[P : Not necessary.];B[hb]
(;W[gb]C[P : In this, rather than respond to black's hane, I would rather jump into the centre and begin a process of mutual damage (check out mutual damage on sensei's). Consider the variation]
;B[ib];W[gn]C[P : Sealing up territory is a good instinct, however, white's ability to reduce here is much more threatening than black's, and white will probably end in sente, allowing him to play these smaller moves. Best to jump into the centre.]
;B[mi]TR[mh][ng][nh][og][oj][pg][ph][pi][pj][qj][rj][rk]LB[im:A]
C[[jasonolson\] White's marked stones are already dead, no need to further reduce territories. Perhaps black would be better served playing at A, preventing white from further breaking into the center?

P : Yup, black would have won by a lot if s/he's played at A.]
;W[jm]TR[hn][ho]LB[io:A]C[[jasonolson\] Further reducing black's center influence/territory. Also threatens to cut at A, capturing black's marked stones in a ladder (actually, a net?).

P : Haha, yes, a net it is. Good move.];B[io];W[im]LB[il:A]
[lm:C][ln:B]C[[jasonolson\] When I played this, I was thinking I was connecting my invading stones to my solid group on the left (by preventing black from playing this point first). However, if black were to play J-7 instead, white can play at A and remain connected. So this move is not necessary. So perhaps B or C would be better?

P : Good analysis. Both b and c are large moves, however I believe L9 should be played first, kikashi threatening the cut. Proverb : Play kikashi first in a fight, as they may not remain kikashi.]
;B[km]C[P : This response is too blunt. Black's stone does not declare any territory, allowing white to attack and flow around either side.]
;W[kl]C[P : Right idea, but the bottom area is larger.];B[kn]
;W[ll]TR[mh][ng][nh][og][oj][pg][ph][pi][pj][qj][rj][rk]C[[jasonolson\] Further invading, and vaguely threatening to make the marked stones live.

P : unfortunately, those white stones are totally doomed. It does threaten the cut at l10 though.]
;B[mk]C[P : This move also does nothing.];W[lm];B[ln];W[jn]
;B[jo];W[ml];B[nm];W[is];B[js];W[hs]C[P : Initiating this hane was not a very good play by white, as it loses sente. Black plays at k2, but s/he does not have to, as the k1 stone can run and connect with the black group on the other side. The best move for white could have been B9.]
;B[jr];W[ai];B[aj]C[P : This hane was also not  good. If black had hane'd first, it would have been a gote sequence for him/her, as white would not need to support afterwards. And white's hane here is worth only one point, as black has no territory on the left to reduce.
As well, when black's connects at B9, it is sente as it is also an invasion of white's territory.]
;W[ah];B[bk];W[bl]C[P : The contact play here is not a good defence. Better to play at b7. See the variation a few moves on for why.]
;B[cl];W[cm]
(;B[ck]C[P : See variation here.];W[bm];B[dm];W[em];B[dn];W[en]
C[P : It would have been better to block underneath, as your three stones are threatened with isolation, and it's generally easier to make eyes at the side.]
;B[cn];W[bn]C[P : Calmly handled. These sort of pointless invasion can actually become problems if the defending player over reacts, or is tired at the end of a challenging game.]
;B[jk];W[jl]C[[jasonolson\] Connecting center stones over to left group.]
;B[al];W[am]C[P : Eep!! Danger! Black could exploit this at B5 immediately and fight a ko.]
;B[ak];W[ik]TR[am][bl][bm][bn][cm]LB[ao:B][bo:A][do:C]C[[jasonolson\] BAD MOVE. I hadn't realized that if black played at A, the marked stones would be dead. Needed to play at A, B or C instead.

P : It's good you notice in retrospect. You probably won't make that mistake twice!]
;B[kk]LB[bo:A]C[[jasonolson\] Black didn't notice point A either.]
;W[lk]C[P : Good, playing endgame moves that are sente first.]
;B[lj];W[ji]C[P : This move is not associated with any territory -- better to leave it in case a ko arises (for instance, around those five stones on the left!)]
;B[ij];W[eh]C[P : I don't really see what you were aiming for with this move. It doesn't seem that black should have to respond.]
;B[cj]C[P : If black did need to respond, D9 would have been better as it would have reduced your territory.]
;W[dk]C[P : This move is honte, meaning a supporting move outside the sequence of play, allowing the other person to take sente or make a honte move as well.]
;B[ga];W[fa];B[ha];W[fb]C[P : This cut was safe and did not need to be supported.]
;B[oe];W[od]C[P : This response does nothing.];B[pl]C[P : This move reduces black's own territory by one point.]
;W[gd];B[ko]C[P : Another odd move.];W[in]C[P : That point, and others similar to it, is not worth anything, and would have simply been left neutral at the end of the game.]
;B[mm];W[ki];B[kj];W[tt]LB[mp:A]C[[jasonolson\] Is black's A territory actually safe? Or is there enough room for white to invade?

P : Play it out a bit if you want to try (could be fun practice), but I think it is very definitely safe. 
A good practice for this sort of thing -- take a blank board, and place a black stone on every second point around the whole outer edge (you can do it on every point if you want, it doesn't really matter). White play first and tries to live, winning the game if s/he makes a living group, while black tries to prevent the formation of a live group. Very challenging for white, but fun and instructive for both sides.]

[ss]C[P : Good game Jason. I really enjoyed working through it. I have some general comments.

Spend some time working on your endgame. More than half of your endgame moves did not have any effect. One important concept in the endgame is the size of moves, meaning how many points a move is worth (roughly or specifically). This was important all throughout the game. Both sides of this game consistently played small points and persisted in insignificant fights when there were points literally ten times that size available. Developing 'counting' skills is valuable for this.
A general tactical point is to not automatically respond to your opponent's moves. Often in this game, your opponent's moves did not require responses, or the responses were smaller than important moves elsewhere. As a guideline, assume you're going to play elsewhere (tenuki), then make a case for why you shouldn't. this will involve considering the whole board position on every move, which, along with counting, will help you to determine direction of play and to develop a strategy -- for instance, if you could reply to an opponent's move to save a group, but you're ahead on territory and there are big points on the board, it might be best to let the group die, take the big point, and then another if your opponent uses his/her next move to kill the group. You might suffer a loss of influence, but if you're ahead on territory, it's your opponent who has to work. You  did that well in this game, allowing your opponent to mess around while you took large points on the left side. Being more consistent and deliberate about that will make your game better. 
It's interesting to observe that you  lost every fight in this game except the top right corner, and yet still managed to win in the end. That observation shows you both your strengths and weaknesses. One strength is that you  are aware of big points and often get to them before your opponent does. This forces your opponent onto the offensive, at which point another of your strengths comes in -- defence. I know you were uncertain at times about how to defend, but largely you did a good job, using counter attacks to seal up your own weaknesses while hacking away at theirs. This defensiveness becomes a fault at times though, which is what I mean when I say you lost almost every fight. In nearly every situation where your interests came into conflict with those of your opponent's, you ended up  with less territory and less thickness. The lower right side is a good example of this. I have two suggestions. One is to have a clear idea of what you want when you go into a conflict. On the lower right, your goal could have been to split black's position, get out into the centre, make a base on the side, and work in conjunction with your wall above, but instead your only goal was to avoid death and so that's really all you did. In go, it's important to have a plan, but also to always be changing that plan as the board changes. Another idea is to deepen your understanding of when groups are safe. If your group is already assured two eyes, if it has room to run, or if it has multiple options, it can be considered fairly safe unless the local situation changes. Being confident of the safeness of your groups, as well as knowing when your groups aren't safe (for instance, the group on the right that died), is very valuable for determining your strategy. It also helps to understand exactly what sort of moves constitute attacking (reducing the territory or safeness of your opponent) and which are defense (improving your own safeness, securing your territory).
I hope this was useful to you. Like I said at the start, email me with any comments or questions. I'd love to have some dialogue. Also, I play online under the name petition. I mostly only go on to watch stronger players' games or tournaments games on igs, but if you see me online, ask for a game.
Be well!])
