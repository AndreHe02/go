C[[Review performed by Pierre-Normand Houle, "gostone" on IGS, 19k.
This review was requested by Phelan who played white in this game.\]

PNH: This is a nice game. You would have won with a big margin if you had been bolder
in invading your opponent's corners when they were open and if you had defended
you own corners better. I show and example of corner invasion (under the 4-4 stone)
in one early variation and I show you how to defend at the end.

What will make you progress the most is 1) play more solidly, that is, try to keep
your stones connected rather than run around your opponent to capture his stones
at any cost. This is an advise for contact fights. Don't have as a goal to capture
you opponent's stones, unless you have to do so to live.

2) Attack at a distance and make faster moves to run, attack or secure territory.
Learn to use the one point jump, the large and small keima (knight moves).
Watch games of slightly stronger players and you'll quickly get the point.
In some opening patterns there can be 20 more moves without a single
contact play. Think about the global frameworks you stones and those
of your opponent make.   I show many variations to illustrate some of these principles. Feel free to
E-mail me if you have any questions.

(;W[ee]LB[cc:D][dc:B][cd:C][dd:A]C[A move that far from the corner is very rarely played in the opening. Moves like A, B, C,
and D are more usual and get a better grip of the corner. D enphasizes territory and A
enphasizes more center influence. See variations.];B[nd];W[ep]
;B[fp]LB[cp:A]C[Question: How should I have defended against this?

PNH: Black wants to attack but he should not have attached.
A black move at "A" would have disputed the corner. Attaching
to an enemy stone only strengthens it and so should only be
used for defense. (contact play strenghtens both players)];W[fo]
C[PNH : This move is fine.];B[gp]
(;W[hp]LB[eo:A]TR[hp]C[PNH : "A" is better. It gives you good shape and prevent black from cutting there.

Don't try to capture those two black stones. Go is a game of territory, not a game
of capture. Once you start to realize that you progress a lot.]
;B[go];W[gn];B[ho]LB[fn:B][eo:C][hp:A]C[PNH: Now black has a solid shape. White "A" stone is isolated and
almost capured with only two liberties left. The cutting points at "C" and
"D" are also quite serious. Think about keeping your stones connected
and cutting appart those of your opponent.]

weaknesses. Although it would be nice to capture him, it is unrealistic here.
You don't surround groups with contact play. Nor is it what you should be thinking
about in the opening. Moves A, B, C, D, E, F, G are all big (G is for defence)]

How should I have attacked from here? I think I could have gotten more territory

PNH: This is a nice penetration of yours. It should ensure victory. The rest is just
a matter of technique. This will improve fast if you continue to play. Study books and
submit other games to the GTL from time to time and you strategical oulook will keep
up with your improving technique.

At this point you don't need more territory. Your ladders capture in the center
left goes a big way in protecting your territory in two quarters of the board.
You just need to invade blacks wide open moyo on the right side and rob
him of a medium chunk of territory];B[mk];W[nl];B[lj]
