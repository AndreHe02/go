;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[hd];W[ge]C[[wund\] This is not a valid move. In general, u can=20
only play here when the adjacent corner (Q16) is=20
yours.]
(;B[ed]C[[wund\] The wrong response; this way, white gets=20
away with it :-) (variation1)]
(;W[fd]C[[wund\] Not good; white gets bad shape this way=20
(variation2)];B[ee];W[dc];B[cc]C[[wund\] In this position, G15 should be at F15. That=20
is why this is bad for white :-)];W[he];B[jd];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb]
C[[wund\] About the best white can do];B[eq]C[[wund\] ok i guess. Black can be satisfied; the=20
exchange at the top is locally in his favour, and he=20
gets sente (initiative) to play in the empty corner.];W[cp]
;B[cn]C[[wund\] Good];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[dq];W[dp]C[[wund\] A blunder.White should make the=20
bamboo-joint at C5];B[cq];W[ck];B[ch]C[[wund\] This seems a bit slack to me. I see no=20
reason not to extend up to C11];W[di];B[bp]C[[wund\] Normally this kind of move is 'aji keshi',=20
wasting of possibilities, but white's shape is so bad=20
that this can't be bad for black :-)];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]C[[wund\] In effect, white has played D4 inside what=20
should have been a bamboo-joint anyway. White=20
lost a whole move here.];B[fo];W[dn];B[fn]C[[wund\] Excellent. Brilliant shape for black, while=20
white still has very bad aji.];W[mq]C[[wund\] Good]
(;B[qj]LB[qf:A]C[[wund\] Big, of course. But since u r a bit heavy on=20
the upper side u might also consider playing at A=20];W[nc]
;B[lc]C[[wund\] reasonable, i guess.

I have trouble finding a really good move for black=20
(ask a stronger player :-)). That is why i would have=20
played R10 at R14];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rc];B[rd]C[[wund\] This is an overplay. I have seen this move=20
played (in a pro game), but not like this. What will u=20
do when white pushes up at O16?]
(;W[nb]C[[wund\] white should cut (variation3)];B[kq]C[[wund\] Considering that white defended solidly at=20
O18 this is a huge overplay. White need only play=20
O16 and u r in big trouble

There is a Go proverb 'urgent moves go before big=20
moves'. L3 is certainly big, but defending at O16 is=20
much more urgent.];W[qo];B[qm]C[[wund\] Not good. As said, u should defend at the=20
top. Apart from that, this makes little contribution to=20
ur moyo (to low), and has no effect on white=20
whatsoever.];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[ok];W[qh];B[nd];W[mi]C[[wund\] Finally! Even so, white has caught up with u.=20
U have invested many stones in ur upper side, and=20
they r not working very efficiently.

Both of u didn't seem to realise, but there is still a=20
potential cut at N16. Black has to be very careful; if=20
white gets some thickness, .....];B[ki]C[[wund\] Very agressive. Let's count the score at this=20
point:

Black: lower side ~ 25 points
 upper left  ~ 15 points
 right side  ~ 05 points
for a total of 45 points (very roughly :-))

White: left side  ~ 10 points
 lower side ~ 18 points
 upper left  ~ 08 points
 upper right ~ 08 points
for a total of 44 points (very roughly :-))

adding komi, white may be slightly ahead]
(;W[lj]C[[wund\] U scared him bad! I would either cut=20
immediately (variation4), or make good shape=20
(variation5)];B[mk]C[[wund\] Wrong direction. U don't want to force him=20
into ur lower side territory!];W[kj];B[ji];W[nj];B[nk];W[jj]
;B[ii];W[jn];B[jp];W[ij];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[gl];W[hm]
;B[oq]C[[wund\] This is courting disaster. With the white=20
group virtually settled, the cut at N16 becomes all=20
the more severe. Consider also that u gained=20
another major weakness around G10.]
(;W[op]C[[wund\] White should just take sente and cut=20
(variation6)];B[nq];W[np];B[mr];W[mp];B[lr]C[[wund\] The 'shape' move is at P2]
;W[pr];B[rn];W[ro];B[rh];W[rg];B[ri];W[qf];B[oj]C[[wund\] Bad kikashi!]
;W[nh];B[ci]C[[wund\] Let me say it again..... u r much to thin.]
;W[cj];B[bn]
(;W[ao]C[[wund\] This does demonstrate how bad white's=20
shape is. I looked at it for some time, but it's very=20
difficult to find decent moves for white around here.=20
Perhaps he should make an eye? (variation7)];B[dm];W[cm];B[en]
;W[bm];B[do];W[an];B[dn];W[ej];B[dh];W[eh];B[cb];W[eg];B[df]
;W[lg]C[[wund\] This is the moment of thruth. Estimating the=20
score again:

Black: lower side ~ 30 points
 upper left  ~ 18 points
 right side  ~ 10 points
for a total of 58 points

White: left side  ~ 03 points
 lower side ~ 12 points
 upper left  ~ 05 points
 upper right ~ 08 points
for a total of 28 points

considering komi, white is about 20 - 25 points=20
behind. If white cuts at N16 he should be able to=20
capture ur wall, in sente even, considering that u=20
will have to defend around G11 to keep the rest=20
from dying. This puts white ahead.

So what about M13?];B[le]C[[wund\] vital point, very good];W[kf]
;B[ke];W[gj];B[jf]C[[wund\] Very good];W[jg];B[if];W[ig];B[hf]
;W[hg]C[[wund\] This is pushing once to many...];B[gf];W[fb]
;B[ff]C[[wund\] Ur safe!];W[db];B[fh];W[hi];B[so]C[[wund\] From here on it's endgame. compared with=20
my calculations around move 108 white has gained=20
about 20 points from his attack, so this is a close=20
game. I think u r ahead, though, especially since=20
it's ur move :-)];W[sp];B[sn];W[rq];B[on];W[qn];B[rl];W[dg]

board he can reduce ur bottom]
