C[This was the 5th round of Castrop Tournament '06, Germany.
I played as black, 7kyu.
My opponent was from the Netherlands, 5kyu.

The system was Macmahon.
I knew that  in this system you get in the last round
someone nearly your rank, but I also knew that there
weren't many 7kyu and 6kyu.
So I had much respect in this 5kyu.

Nevertheless, I tried to make it a tough game,
so when recorded, I could learn much of it.

It would be very nice, to give not only comments on black(me), but also on moves the opponent made.

rika:
Hi, I'm Chun-Kit, currently 2k in Germany.
It's a interesting game for a 7k and you had a chance to win the game. The ending is something to improve.]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[pc]C[I played diagonally to make things more interesting.]
;W[dc];B[qe]C[rika:
personally for a fast develop Q5 or D15 is ok.];W[id];B[kd]
C[I am not sure, if this wasn't an overplay of me.
But nevertheless, I wanted to play there to make use of my two stones.

rika:
ok, but since white occupies black's top extension, playing there is not urgent.]
;W[cf];B[qo];W[qj]C[This I found interesting.
On the one hand, it is good for white to be able to
play hiraki (extension) on either r13 or r7, thus
having a semeai.

but... on the other hand I was not urged to play there,
because he played no real pincer.

rika:
it's a fine move.];B[ql]C[so I wondered myself, why I played r8.
it is bad, isn't it ?
forcing him to do a good move

rika:
it's ok! Playing from your weak side.];W[qg];B[nq]C[but then again, this is also a good option, attacking
the corner from 2 sides

rika:
good];W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[qp];W[oq]C[It looks somehow overcrowded for white, having no real eyes, looks ineffective to me

rika:
the result is ok for white (settle a group in the right vs. getting small in the corner)]

(;B[jq];W[cn];B[dl]C[rika: 
f4 for a peaceful development, pincer with d9 also possible]

(;W[fq]C[rika:
not common to play here, either jump out E6 or C3];B[dn];W[cq]
;B[co];W[dq];B[nr]C[now white seems to have a bad start.
as it turns out in the game, this was luck, because it nearly won the game for me]

;B[gg];W[if];B[eh];W[gc]C[after this, the groups are connected.
was there any way I could have killed the group ?
Or maybe to do a more severe attack ?

I felt like gaining not much in chasing his stones.

Another point, we ourselves asked us, was,
if black had the possibility to kill the white stones on the right corner.... or gaining advantage of weakness

rika:
the previous attack has one goal: to weaken the right group. after bN10 it was clear.]

[ab][aa]C[the komi was 6 points.
white won with 1 Points.

there should be some mistakes in the endgame ?

rika:
there are some small stuffs, but I don't know if you have enough time for the ending stage.
Losing the lower left 3 stones is heavy, cost you the game.
But nevertheless, there is something to improve...
Good luck in your future tournaments.
