C[I get some new ideas in online lectures, so I'm trying to use them in my games.

First question: Efficiency of my moves
I need to get rid of moves which doing very little and cost too much. I always trying to play tenuki when I think that local move is not worth enough, but I'm sure I' still making lots of mistakes...

Second question: Direction of play
As usuall I want to know If I understand direction of play during openning and middlegame properly. I want to discuss mainly openning and middlegame. Macroendgame is important too, but I don't know how to ask questions in that part of the game... I think it's just matter of counting and estimating.

Thank you very much for your time! Also many thanks to GTL.]
;B[qe];W[dd];B[pq]TR[dd]C[With D16, I like this opening. When white approach lower right corner, I can play pincer as extension from R15 stone. When white approach upper right corner on P17, I can press him down and then build moyo on right side. Approach at P16 I would answer at M16. Anyway I usually feel comfortable during opening like this.

Q: Considering direction of play, is there any weaknes in this formation ?

prana: No, it is also played by professionals.]
(;W[cp]
(;B[fq]LB[fc:C][nd:D][oe:E][ep:A][eq:B]C[I don't like E3 approach, because I was afraid of white's pincer at G3. So I tried this kakari...

prana: A, B, C are also possible, and even D or E have been played (by professionals). The pincer is nothing to be afraid of.
Review some games with these pincers, and learn how to handle these situations.]
;W[hq]C[But white made pincer anyway...

Q: How to answer this move effectively? Is there any better move than F3 ?

prana: I think F3 is possible, but e3 or e4 are locally the normal moves.]
(;B[dp]C[prana: you are preparing an attack on H3. 
There is nothing wrong with this, but in order to gain thickness for F3 you have to give territory to w. 
I think the easier way is to take the corner, and let w build thickness outside. The black stone at q3 reduces w thickness perfectly, so you wouldn't come out badly. (see variation)]
;W[cq];B[dn]C[I tried to get thickness before I attack H3 stone...]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[co]
(;B[en]LB[fn:A]C[I was thinking about F6 move, but I wanted to stop white going to left side...

prana: A looks like proper shape. Don't forget, you want to attack h3. But you can only attack, if e4 group is strong (i.e. not heavy).]
;W[cm]
(;B[jp]LB[kp:B][jq:A]TR[dn][en][dp][ep][fq]C[I wasn't sure about high/low pincer, but I knew, that my marked group is not alive yet, so I have to run with her, after white run at H5. With stone on K3, white can press me down on L4 and get nice thickness.

Q: Should be better the low pincer?

prana: Higher pincer is better for fighting. You play A, if you plan to connect under h3. But this is submissive in this situation.

I would rather play at B, K4 is too close to the h3 group.]
;W[ho];B[hm]LB[ek:A][mp:B]C[I wanted to build moyo on right side, while this move helps my group on the right side...

Q: Was it good approach or overplay?

prana: Attacking H5 is not easy, but at least h5 seems to be the correct direction.
Alternatives are A or B.];W[in]
(;B[kn]C[prana: This contradicts your first move. white will get out and might fight back.]
;W[im];B[kl]C[This move was too far...];W[hl]C[prana: white is out. Now, F3 is weak.]
;B[fk]C[I have to run...];W[fl];B[el];W[fm]
(;B[dl]C[prana: a bit slow.];W[jr]LB[pj:D][po:A][qo:B][lq:C]
[ir:E]C[While white runs into my territory...

Q: How should I use marked stones to get best result? A was thinking about A to D moves...

prana: Difficult position. 
I think A, B and D are possible. 
I don't like C, it is rather defensive.

As an alternative, I think E might be interesting too]
(;B[kr]C[I didn't know which one, so I tried to connect or build wall...]

Try to defend indirectly.
Look at  A, it is much bigger!];W[qo]
(;B[qm]C[I didn't want to fight for corner, as it was very small... I rather build finally moyo
prana: If I where white, I would happily take the corner.It is around 25p, not small at all.]
;W[op];B[on]
(;W[pp]C[prana: mistake. black can now live in the corner starting at san-san, very painful for white.]
;B[jd]C[Right group is alive and I have nice moyo. I felt good at this moment.

Q: Was my judgment wrong? Was ther situation better for white?

prana: I agree. white doesn't have much territory (also because of the aji at R3.)]
;W[qk]
(;B[ql]C[prana: I think, you could play also a  bit more relaxed now.]
;W[pk];B[qh];W[lm]C[First white's mistake, I think. My group is already connected so I don't need to run into center...]
;B[ol]C[I attacked two stones instead

prana: good move.];W[ok];B[nl];W[mj];B[ll];W[li]
(;B[nh]LB[oi:A]C[Now I wasn't sure how to continue attack... Or should I simply defend territory playing at Q17?

prana: attacking is good style. I would look for the vital point. What about A?]
(;W[lg]
(;B[fc]C[prana: I don't understand this move. Locally, I would rather play on the left side, to make some territory with d11.
But, still you want to attack M13, right? Thus, I would play A like in the variation]
;W[cf];B[md];W[pc]
(;B[rc]C[My mistake, trying to kill two groups...

prana: I like this move! You deprive white from a base, while securing your own group. BTW, you don't have to kill the white groups, just keep up pressure...]

(;W[qb]LB[nb:A]C[White gives me sente so I tried again attack center group to get more profit on the top

prana: I agree, white can play tenuki, or at least defend a bit more actively, e.g. with A.
If white plays tenuki, he has to be very confident about the status of the corner. Can you read the variations?]
