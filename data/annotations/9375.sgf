C[Hello,

My name is Frank and I put this review together.  There were a few moments that black could have taken better advantage of white's mistake.  I tried to add variations to point those out.

One big thing I noticed in this game is that you should try to find good reasons for playing your moves.  Some moves were sente moves that did not help you as much as they helped your opponent.  Another thing I noticed was that you should not be jealous.  In this game, black had a huge moyo - much larger than white.  Instead of just making the moyo very strong, you invaded side territory instead and put the game in doubt.

Of course, in the end you still fought well and beat your opponent :)

Good game.  I hope this review helps.
