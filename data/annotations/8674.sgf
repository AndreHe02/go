C[I'm white in this game. This game was played on tygem. My opponent is tygem 5d. The time settings were 20 minutes main time, with 3 byo-yomi periods at 30 seconds each.

Although I'm 5d in the account I played in I think my real strength is around tygem 4d. (which is kgs 2d-3d)

I think I have issues mainly with opening and judgement. I've been stuck at the same strength for a really long time so any tips on improving would be appreciated.

Thank you very much!];B[qo];W[pd]C[reid: Hello Howard.  Let's start by considering the relation between these two stones.  R5 influences the right hand side at the expense of the corner.  Q16 in isolation extends influence along the top side and the right side at the expense of a firm hold on the corner.  Considering both stones together, we see that Q16 is contending for space that R5 has already laid a claim to.

I think this early it would be better to simply take the opposite corner.

If you want to confront black, then the lower left corner would be better because black's influence is weak along the bottom side.

The proverb says 'play away from strength' which here means black's low position on the right side.]
;B[ce];W[dp];B[qf];W[nc];B[rd];W[qh]C[I regret playing this.

reid: I agree.  Taking the corner with R17 is simple and good.  R12 will suffer from the low (strong) placement of R5.]
;B[qc];W[qe]LB[pf:A]C[reid: The joseki move here is A.  There is a slight loss of aji when white forces with R15.  Better to leave it unplayed.]
;B[re];W[pf];B[rf];W[pg];B[id]C[I feel like my influence is pretty useless now.

reid: Yes, the joseki in the upper right ends in gote.  White needs a position in the upper left to make this work.

On the other hand, black's extension here is not great - the corner is still open to invasion.]
;W[pq];B[mq];W[op];B[on];W[mp];B[lp];W[mo];B[jq]LB[oo:B][nq:A]
C[I was expecting black o3.

reid: The reason black didn't play A (O3) is worth some study: black A induces white B (P5).  Black almost certainly has to respond on the right, which would then give white a powerful attack at K3 (or J4 might be even better).]
;W[nq];B[fq];W[dn]LB[cn:C][qp:A][rp:B]C[I think tenuki at r7 might have been better.

reid: I think extending one the left is the correct idea.  R7 is not a great attack because black R13 undercuts white's position on the right side.  If white wants to attack black's position on the right, white A or B would be better, taking the corner while inducing black to extend towards the strong white R12 stone.

However, the urgent situation is the left side.  White really doesn't want to give black a chance to attack from the other side (around C).

However, since black has C15 in place on the third line already, white should make a solid position on the left side with C (C6) instead of D6.]
;B[qk]C[Black seems settled on both sides now.];W[hq]LB[ro:B]
[qp:A][rp:C]C[reid: Hmm, you said in the previous move that black is settled on both sides, but then you try to attack him.

There is a weakness in black's position here, but I think white needs to wait a bit before trying to exploit it.  Better would be to take easier targets: the upper left corner is open, and the extension along the left side (to C10) is also big.  Even white A, black B, white C to take a large corner and make black's shape awkward would be better.

This weakness is not going away any time soon, and even if black does fix it (with H4 perhaps), white is not too upset because there isn't a huge area for black here.]
;B[hr]C[After black played this I felt like I didn't have any good contiunations.

reid: that's a clue that H3 is not ideal.  But black answered low, so it's not too terrible for white.  You can consider it a good forcing exchange.]
;W[dc];B[fc];W[de];B[cd];W[dd];B[df];W[cc];B[ch];W[ef]LB[dg:A]
C[reid: black has a serious weakness at C14.  Exchanging E14 for black A (D13) just helps black to patch up that problem.  I think white should just jump to F15 if he wants to keep his access to the center with this group.

Try to avoid helping your opponent fix his aji.];B[cl]LB[cj:A]
[fp:B]C[reid: interesting tactic for black, but somewhat dangerous.  It's a good attack, but if white manages to take sente, he could probably do some serious damage with a counter-attack around A.  But first, white needs to respond to the attack.

Sounds like a good time for an indirect counter-attack with something like white B.  If he can strengthen this group in sente, he can think about a splitting attack at A.]

;W[gr];B[hp];W[gq];B[jr];W[hs];B[dg]C[reid: black gets back to fixing his aji.

Black is ahead on territory at this point.  White needs something big to compensate.]
;W[fe]C[Is this move too slow?

reid:  Yes, I think so.  If white is ahead, this is a nice safe move, but white needs to attack to get back in the territory race.]
;B[kd];W[cj]C[reid: this looks difficult.  The black groups above and below are close to alive already, or at least a whole lot more lively than the single white stone is.

I think I would want to try taking M3 to see if black can get two eyes for the bottom group.Alternatively, white might be able to get an attack on the upper group with K18 (although  black already reinforced this group so it would kind of  be like striking after the iron has cooled down).

It's always preferable to fight when the fight is in your favor.  D10 is significantly outnumbered in this area.]

;B[jm];W[fm]C[I don't think I Can really attack black so I think this was bad.

reid: it looks difficlut for black to save those two stones without getting pushed around quite a bit, so perhaps now is a good time for R4.]

reid: looks like.  P7 was a bit strange, then R7 looked deep and risky.]

;W[na];B[lg]C[All these moves by black are pretty big I regret playing b11.

reid: B11 is big too.  You could consider N18 instead of O18 to improve your shape and stop these pushes that black has in this area.  But white is not really losing anything here, it's just inherent in the shape that these moves are available to black.]
;W[kg];B[lf];W[lh];B[mg];W[mh];B[ng];W[od];B[pc];W[bg]C[I think I should have defended the r12 group. (end of uploader comments)

reid: So I guess black is a program?  Programs are usually good at reading and endgame type stuff.  You can defeat them with good strategy so that a few points in endgame don't really matter.  They are not so good at evaluating thickness, weakness, and high-level board-position evaluation.

I think if you were a bit more cautious about jumping into battles and instead think about what are the important points to play, you would make some progress (particularly against this program).  I can see that you identify weak points to attack quite well, but now you need to be patient and let the right time for the attack come around instead of just jumping right on it.  Of course, you also need to make sure he doesn't fix his weakness, which is where appreciation of aji-keshi comes into play.

Ideally, you will start that attack just before he is going to defend it, and after you have developed some support structure that tips the fight into your favor.

Good luck, play strong - reid.];B[bh];W[ah];B[oh];W[nh];B[og]
