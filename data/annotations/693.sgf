BL[5301];W[qm]C[> I am surprised I would have thought k4 bigger

Yes, It is surely bigger for white. But that's not white's main concern. With  your next stone at B10 and white is in three parts concretely.]
WL[5294];B[fq]C[This is ok.]BL[5294];W[dn]WL[5189];B[dr]C[But this is not. Of  course exchange 9 for 10 is ok under some circumstances you don't have to  make 7 (F3) alive just now! With this move you destroy chances for  potential invasion at 3,3 at C3 later on the game.



Your continuation shows that you clearly have right sense of where the game  is going.]
BL[5288];W[cq]WL[5097];B[jq]C[With this continuation you  provide white easy way to flatten your shape with say H4. I'd prefer J3 or  J4, but they clearly show that D2 is out of place at this phase of game.]
BL[5275];W[mq]C[Quite cool move from white. It's quite hard to make this  group easy to handle without making stone 6 weak.



But it's not your problem :), so we can seek effective ways to use N3's  weakness for good.]
WL[4984]
(;B[mp]C[This is not good. I see you want to get  to the center or kill white (or both). White is in tight place, you should  get stronger with his weaknesses and way to do it is by attacking it more  indirectly. Just make moves which don't call for a fight. This one does. N5,  O4, O5, M5, L5 don't invite fight. They'll induce it later, but you are  stronger then and you'll have more ability to choose way how to let white  live. And take advantage of it.



If you want to play smoothly and make "easy" but effective move, one might  play somekind of double attack like P6 or P7, even O6 can be thought as  double attack.]
BL[5269];W[lp]WL[4916];B[lq]C[I probably should have  played 15 at O4



That's one option, yes. After that you can still put pressure on white group  and go to center and strengthen your own groups.]
BL[5260];W[kq]WL[4890];B[lr]BL[5247];W[kr]WL[4888];B[mr]C[Maybe 19 at M1?]
BL[5242];W[nq]WL[4871];B[kp]BL[5236];W[lo]C[This far quite good result.]
WL[4857];B[jo]C[This is quite good move (afterall, I tried to make example where  are weaknesses of this but I couldn't :). But I think that it is much easier  for you if you keep game simple and just capture two white stones.]
BL[5228];W[jr]WL[4832];B[np]C[This makes white life quite easy.]
;W[nr]WL[4816];B[oq]C[Now you push white to live! But this move is quite necessary  to make anything reach for center.]
BL[5208];W[or]WL[4809];B[pr]BL[5206];W[ms]WL[4800];B[fc]C[Again you sensed the right point to get away from  situtation and take sente! But you should notice (and keep mind) you have  one very weak group on the lower side! It is on two parts and only left part  have anything to turn to eyes.]
BL[5194];W[ec]WL[4795];B[fd]BL[5191];W[df]WL[4791];B[ic]C[This extend is to right direction, good! Better  position would be at J16 or even K16. This extension is used when you are  trying to make your group alive in a small region. Now you have plenty of  space.]
BL[5187];W[cj]C[Extremely good move from white.]WL[4777];B[ff]
C[Wrong  idea. You *don't* want to make white's walls any stronger. So white can take  great profit or utilize his stone 6.]
BL[5186];W[nc]WL[4771];B[oc]BL[5177];W[lc]WL[4763];B[nd]BL[5173]
;W[md]WL[4759];B[me]C[With  this move you should take some profit and prepare attack to 6. O15. White on  top is still without good base.]
BL[5171];W[le]WL[4751];B[nb]C[Definitely  too haste. After this you have plenty of weaknesses.]
BL[5168];W[mc]C[Now you  can see, white's attack was placed on wrong side. Stone 6 is even more  lonerier.]
WL[4744];B[kd]C[>Wrong move. Because of O15.



Yes it was. Moreover, you don't want to make white stronger.]

;W[od]WL[4714];B[os]C[> Ko threat?? Or do I still misunderstand?



Yes, this is ko threat and you are fighting ko. Good!



But this ko isn't necessary for you or for white to win! So instead you  should play Q17 and make sure white don't get corner and all your points!]
BL[5138];W[ls]WL[4710];B[nd]BL[5137];W[lg]WL[4703];B[od]C[So now  you see, you haven't gained anything. With winning the ko. White is still  alive and white is still capable to take over 3,3 point (or at least make ko  for live). Additionally your territory is wide open for white invasion from  down parts.]
BL[5128];W[ph]WL[4692];B[ng]BL[5124];W[mf]WL[4690];B[pg]C[After 59 (O13) natural continuation is at P12. I don't think this  is correct way to play, but 61 is definitely not so good.



Idea with 59 is that you want to get out of corner. But 61 terminates this  idea. Now you want to be in the corner.]
BL[5122];W[oh]WL[4687];B[eh]BL[5103];W[dh]C[Move 63 gives white easy profit.]
WL[4682];B[ke]C[This is  second totally wasted move. Interesting is that you don't have these move  much, only two to this stage of game, and both are in the same place  (remember 47).]
BL[5093];W[og]C[Incredible valuable move white, now he  doesn't have *any* weak group.]
WL[4677];B[qg]C[> I am not sure if 67 at R13  was the best move.



No it wasn't, you are in no direct danger.



I'm not sure where is the direction you want to move the game from this  point. So I can't give you good advise. I'd think that you should attack  stone 6.]
BL[5082];W[nh]C[White wants to win peacefully, so he takes no risks.  After this game is quite easy for white.]
WL[4672];B[qe]C[> 69 at R15 probably  too conservative.



Again, out of blue you are really interesting to defend you corner.



Move like R9 can now be quite effective. You can link up it to either up or  down.]
BL[5081];W[ko]WL[4658];B[jp]BL[5078];W[km]C[Notice white making  good shape.]
WL[4654];B[jm]C[What is the aim of this move?]BL[5077];W[jl]
WL[4652];B[jn]BL[5073];W[lm]C[This is easy for white.]WL[4647]
;B[mn]C[You  just made wall and now you want to wipe white's territory off? If you want to  make wall, you really think you are going to use it for something. If you  want to wipe territory move like O7 or P7 is much effective.



You are remembering your down left group do not have territory neither eyes.  Just remember to make (both) at some point.]
BL[5069];W[mm]WL[4641];B[ir]C[So you do remember :) Good! Now you use you wall!]

Good!]BL[5059];W[cd]C[Standard answer.]WL[4615];B[db]C[Here you take  unnecessary risks. You should simply link underneath at E18. See yourself.]

Yes, I'm not sure either. I'd say you are behind some 5 points in territory  but much in influence.]
WL[4578]
(;B[eo]BL[4990];W[do]WL[4573];B[en]BL[4987];W[dm]C[So far you have utilized your wall! Good. Now we need  closing move, but it's not right time for that.]
WL[4563];B[em]BL[4986];W[hl]WL[4554];B[js]C[> I am sure that was a bad move at this point in  the game. I think I should have answered H8. Probably at H7?



Yes, White 102 aims to destroy your area and 103 doesn't do anything.  Both  of your answers are quite good, but gote. So you have to think does there  exist any move worth more than some 5 points.



How about E9 (connecting your groups and preparing to invade. Invasion at R9  is good timing. There are many alternatives.]
BL[4984];W[hn]WL[4540];B[hm]C[This is bad move and makes all your problems later. Just easily H5.]

If you examine the game by changing colors and placing stones on board,  you'll see more clearly why white is few stones better than you. You played  too many unnecessary moves. And white played few times good shape! But you  should see that you played much more contact than white.



You'll rise few stones just by keeping your game more simple and keeping away  from hard positions. Another thing is that you should not play number of  contact moves.



You have quite good sense where game is heading and what is big.
