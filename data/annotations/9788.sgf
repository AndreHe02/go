C[Hi! I play White in this game.

Daniel: Hello!  Thanks for submitting your game for me to review!  I'll preface all my comments in the sgf with "Daniel:" to clearly differentiate my comments from yours.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[do];W[fp];B[dl]
(;W[dg]TR[nc][qf]C[Here, I didn't know what was the best move. I wanted to approch the black stones to prevent them from having a large territory.

Daniel: I think that there are bigger moves on the board.  Josekipedia recommends C5 (see variation).  Since I personally, don't know all the variations there, I might shy away from that move unless I felt really confident I could read out the fight that starts with WC5 BC4.  What I would actually play in the game is O17 or R14, playing on the biggest side of the board.]
;B[di];W[cj]C[I wanted to try this move, but that was maybe dangerous. is K16 better ?

Daniel: Yes, I think K16 is better.  This sort of move is good if you're trying to kill, but B is not very killable at the moment.]

(;B[ck]
(;W[dj]C[I think I had to play C11, that was safer, but I wanted to trap the D11 stone.]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[bl];W[ei];B[ej];W[dh];B[dk];W[ci];B[fj];W[fc]
C[I think this move was too weak... Maybe playing in the R column is better ? (R14, R6...)

Daniel: I agree.  W seems overconcentrated.  Both alternatives you suggest seem good, and you could also consider K16 or O17 if you'd like to build your own area.]
;B[qk]C[Daniel: Weird spacing by B.]
(;W[qf]C[Daniel: Looks like you noticed the weird spacing as well.  I think it's just a little early to invade though.  (See variations)]
;B[qh]
(;W[of]TR[qh][qk]C[Daniel: Hard to see what W can do with these stones now.  The normal variations from jumping up like this involve attacking R12, but B already has a base, so W will not have anything to attack.]
;B[nd]
(;W[qc]C[Daniel: If you wanted the corner, it's better to just play there directly rather than exchanging P14 for O16 first.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]TR[nd]C[Daniel: O16 is perfectly positioned for B.  This is why W shouldn't have exchanged P14 for O16 earlier.]
;W[rd];B[re]
(;W[sc]
(;B[qe];W[rb]C[I don't know if that was very useful, but i didn't want to run the risk of having my stones death. By the way, I was scared for my 2 stones P14 and R14, and of the territory for black on the right.

Daniel: W definitely needed a move to live.];B[mf]
(;W[nh]C[For me, if my stones are dead, the game is lost. But maybe P12 is better.

Daniel: I don't think this is good logic.  W can afford to get up two stones and use the aji in B's position to reduce the right and it's still a game.  If you do bring them out, I agree that P12 is better.]
;B[jc];W[rf];B[se]
(;W[le]C[In fact, I think I had to try to save my 4 stones (for example with O9 ?), but I wanted to have a large area on the top-left. And with a little luck, save my 4 stones by this way..

Daniel: Yeah, W is invested at this point, and needs to help the four stones.  This move doesn't really do anything besides strengthen B.  Once B got K17, W no longer had a chance to expand the top left any more.  O9 looks a little thin to me.  Q11 seems more promising.]
;B[me];W[ld]C[Daniel: This move doesn't accomplish anything except making M15 heavy.  Now you're more committed to defending a weak stone.  This move should be spent defending the four stones to the right, or making a big move on the bottom.]

(;W[mn]C[I usually play L3 at this time, but i wanted to be a little agressive and to catch the 2 stones H4-L4 (even if i didn't know exactly how)

Daniel: I agree that L3 is too submissive in this situation.  But I don't think W has enough strength for a large scale attack.]
;B[kn];W[jl]LB[kf:2][of:1][jl:3][mn:4][jq:5]C[Daniel: W needs to stay better connected.  W now has five different groups on the board that have no eyes and can be easily separated from each other.  B can pretty much attack at will.]

;W[ji];B[kh];W[ig];B[ih];W[gh]TR[if]C[Daniel: Thin shape.  Probably better to complete the bamboo joint.]
;B[hi];W[gi];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk]C[Daniel: K7 is getting super, super urgent.]

Daniel: Yep.];W[im];B[km];W[hm];B[gn];W[gm]
(;B[jp]C[That was maybe that move which saved me. If Black played J8, I think it would have been awful for me.

Daniel:Hard to say.  The K9 group has a few more stones, but this breaks into W's area at the bottom.]

(;B[qp]C[If he played Q3, I think that would have been harder for me.

Daniel: Yes, Q3 is the better move for B.  This doesn't use B's R6 stone.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[nq];W[nr];B[rq]C[Daniel: Joseki mistake by B.]

(;W[op]C[In fact... maybe a bad idea ? I don't know if my stones always leaves with that. I could play S2 too.

Daniel: S2 is urgent because it is sente for both players.]

Daniel: Thanks for submitting this game.  The thing that would help you improve the most is to focus on keeping your stones well connected and your opponents stone's separated.  K7 is a big example of this, but most of your biggest problems in this game stem from connection issues.  A second important point is to not try to save every stone on the board.  Look for opportunities to sacrifice a small unimportant group and use the aji for profit elsewhere.  Good luck with your go playing!]
