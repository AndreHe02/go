C[Hi!

I appreciate your effort to review my game. Just review for black. To make it easier for you I have specific questions. If you see some big blunders outside of that feel free to point out.]

C[Question: Can I expect here to establish two groups around of D4 or should I just calculate with one stable group and another stone(s) for aji? In the course of the following sequence I was able to establish groups on both sides but I think my opponent didn't play as sharp as possible.]

This is also my last question. If you see an obvious mistake in the rest of the game, just point it out. Otherwise thanks again for the review.]
