RE[W+13.5]

C[JM: To the players:  Thank you for letting me review your game!  I enjoyed it very much.  This game has some fantastic points in it that I did my best to point out.This game had some very complicated fighting in it, some of which was way beyond me.    I am currently a 1kyu on IGS.  Please take all of my comments with a grain of salt.  Only the professionals can say with any certainty what the best move is in a given position.

Both players can gain a lot from focusing on 'juncture points.'  These are moves that define a border between white and black territory.  The player who takes them will control the direction of the next few stones, which can be a difference of quite a few points.

In general, I think Black needs to avoid being so greedy in the openning and be careful of overplays. White obliged in this situation, by fearing many things that black could not actually do.  If white plays more aggressively, he will improve significantly.  If Black plays more patiently, he will.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[pj];W[nc]LB[nq:a][di:b]C[BKAMINS:

I do not like playing san-ren-sei.

Not sure if this approach OK.

Maybe better to play A or B? (relative to the positions of D17 and D4)

JM: I prefer your move to A.  It works better with the D4/D17 combination since the low D17 can provide more support.  B is also fine and is a matter of style.  A is playable, though I think slightly worse.]
;B[kd];W[qf]C[BKAMINS:

Is this playable?

JM: It certainly is.]
(;B[pf]C[JM: This move is usually played at O16.];W[pg];B[qe]
;W[of];B[pe];W[mg];B[nd];W[di];B[mc]C[BKAMINS:

O16 and N17 probabely mistakes.

JM: O16 is an important shape move.  N17, however is greedy, and probably overconcentrated.  However, it does grab about 30 points and makes it easier to chase the white stones later on.  Still, white is not going to try to move this stone out yet, so it isn't urgent.]
;W[id]TR[qf][pg][of][mg]LB[ce:a][de:b]C[BKAMINS:

Expecting A or B (as in the game), but not sure if this is correct direction.

Black might lean against J16 and strongly attact triangled group (is it possible).

JM: Generally it's a bad idea to approach strength.  As you pointed out, black's last move was overconcentrated, this is probably a sign that you should stay away.  The bottom is bigger.]
;B[ce];W[fd];B[bc];W[bb]
(;B[cc]C[BKAMINS:

Variation not very good for black - right?

JM: Correct, however, a white play at C18 instead of B18 leaves black a little less settled.]
;W[cb];B[dg];W[bh]C[JM: Odd shape.  I would prefer c12.  A kill here isn't likely, so don't be so forceful.]
;B[ch];W[ci];B[bg];W[dh];B[cg]LB[ec:a][dd:b]C[BKAMINS:

I was happy with the sequence but not sure if it is OK.

There is a weak spot at A. Maybe should have pressed once at B? (shoudl black defend then like in the variation?)

JM: Playing at B is good because it's a juncture point.  Black can defend the way your variation describes, but it may be preferable to jump out at F13 instead.]

(;W[jp];B[cn]C[BKAMINS:

I think it is too deep

JM: An invasion is probably called for here, so it's not too bad.]

(;W[cl]TR[bh][dh][ci][di]LB[cl:a]C[BKAMINS:

Feel that triangled group working effectively as without C8 it would be weak.

But mabe it is overconcentrated?

JM: It's a tough decision, but I think I prefer the variation.]
;B[bp]
(;W[cq]LB[dn:a]C[BKAMINS:

Is this OK?

Maybe I should play at A immediately?

JM: As white, I would prefer to keep the black as unsettled as possible.  Playing at A invites Black to take C3 and settle his stones nicely]

(;W[fj]LB[fm:a][nq:b][np:c]C[BKAMINS:

Is this the correct way to attack the black group?

Maybe A was better?

Or should the situation be left as is and played at B or C as besst for black now is to tenuki?

JM: I think B or C should be played first, to see Black's response.  The black group should be attacked more indirectly by pressing the right side.  

Both your choice and A are too close.  Something around K8 would be nice.]

;W[gh];B[ff]TR[pj][pp]C[BKAMINS:

This was the sequence I was aiming for - to build white wall in order to effectively attack black triangled formation.

JM: Yes, the white wall does that well.  F14 is a dangerous play for Black, the center stones are still in trouble.  See the variation.

(F14 is the juncture point, so it is important to play here.  However, black needs to make certain that his stones are safe first.)]

(;W[eg];B[ef]SQ[eg]C[BKAMINS:

Was this exchange good for W?

I wanted to protect the cuts.

What would be better shape for attacking black weak group in the center?

JM: White is running away from ghosts.  I don't see any cuts to worry about, especially given the weak black stones.  In my opinion, the exchange was very bad.]
;W[bo];B[do];W[eo];B[ao];W[do];B[ar];W[ap];B[bs];W[an]C[BKAMINS:

Decided to secure the left group. Was it needed as it is gote?

JM: Not needed if you kill the center.  Besides, you just mentioned protecting cuts.  You should either do that, OR secure the group this way, both are definitely not needed.]
;B[if]C[JM: Black is asking to be killed.]
(;W[ih]C[BKAMINS:

This was probabely overly greedy.

Should I have played as in the variation?

Maybe variation better?

;W[ii];B[hi];W[ig];B[kj];W[jk];B[gg]C[BKAMINS:

The sequence was bad for white - overly greedy :(.

But the analysis shows I could kill - is it correct?

JM: Yes, these black stones should have died many times, so your sequence was not greedy at all.]

(;W[ki]C[BKAMINS:

Probably variation much better :(.

JM: Best is probably F12.  It is better shape.  It still gets the kill.  Finally, it will make it easier for the J13 group to escape from any danger.]

Black connected :(.];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]MA[qf][pg][of][mg]
LB[no:a]C[BKAMINS:

This is probabely not very good.

Better at A?

JM: Yes, A is the juncture point.  Although now that the marked white stones aren't as weak, black's right side potential is less. A is still necessary to prevent white's moyo from getting any bigger.]

;W[mh];B[og]C[BKAMINS:

Was it a good decision by black?

JM: I think so, Black loses 10 points in the capture, but gains many more on the side.  If white's center influence was useful, it would be a tougher decision.  However, the center has been white's ever since the construction of the J7-J9 wall.]
;W[li]C[BKAMINS:

Decided to take the group to make stronger group in the cener. Was it OK?

JM: At this point I don't think you had a choice.];B[nm];W[pl]
MA[mm][jc][qr]C[BKAMINS:

Probabely an overplay.

I am not very good at counting but white has a big lead now so it was betterr to play safely. But I do not see where are the big points now?

JM: Whether or not it is an overplay is tough for me to say.  However, I would simply reduce at P9.  That is a big endgame point, along with the other marked points.

This game had the potential to be rather peaceful from this point, with white probably winning.  A move like Q8 goes against that idea.]
