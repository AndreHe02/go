C[J: Hi, my name is Joe. I am roughly 2d AGA. All my comments are preceeded by a "J:". 

I've added several continuations for you to review, and I have a general review of your whole game at the end.]
;B[qd]C[Dear Reviewer,

Thank you for looking at my game!

I am black in this game.

I felt like I played a patient opening and I didn't make any major frustrating mistakes.  However, I just couldn't get the lead and I lost by 2.5 pts.  It seems like I should have been able to keep White's small groups from living so easily--I had W running a number of times, but each time W lived easily and I was left thin.

I have commented to give you an idea of what I thought I was doing with certain moves.  Please critique my thinking and my goals, as well as whether there are better moves.

Thanks!];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[qn];W[np];B[pj];W[cf];B[fd];W[dj]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq]C[I thought W would block on the other side, here.

J: White has potential on both sides. It is hard to say which is best.]

(;W[kq]C[J: This move is slack by white. He is playing inside his moyo instead of attacking yours. You have a slight lead for a while after this.]
;B[rp]C[I thought since he wants the lower side, I'll let him have it.

J: Good thinking. The lower side is very solid and this move takes away his territory while expanding your own.]
;W[qq];B[on]C[J: This is a pivot point between 2 moyos and is very large.]
;W[mn];B[jj];W[jc];B[ce]C[I thought that since the left is open from the bottom, this would be a good exchange.

J: White can close the bottom with C7. It may not be as open as you think.]

(;B[lc];W[gc]
(;B[bf]C[J: This move is not urgent. It would be best to pressure the white group at F17. This would allow you to create territory and create a weak group for white.

The C14 stones are hard to attack, since they have plenty of room to run.]
;W[bg];B[be];W[eb]C[I wasn't sure what to do here.  I thought W would answer at C12, then I would block at F17, leaving his group weak.

I didn't see a way to close the corner and keep an attack on the W group, so I settled for pushing, then going into the left side.

J: Your problem came from B14. 

D17 seems best now if you want to close the corner. It could be played immediately to prevent white C17.]

(;B[gd];W[hc];B[bh]C[J: I think this is your last chance to attack the bottom. A move around K6 would hold white's moyo in check and have an easy time retreating to K10.
White would have a hard time ignoring any pressing moves against the bottom since he's invested so many moves there.]
;W[ch];B[cj];W[ck];B[ag];W[cg];B[cl];W[bk];B[dl];W[el];B[dk]
;W[bj];B[ej];W[di];B[ek]C[This made me happy, but I had a hard time making the most of it.  W lived easily and I didn't make much of a dent on the bottom.

J: W's push at E8 helped his bottom moyo and now he has sente.]
;W[im]C[J: White's moyo is getting out of hand.]
(;B[eh]C[J: You just said that white lived easily, but you still decided to attack here.
The problem with this attack is that you let white make 2 definate eyes and end in sente.
This stone is also hard for you to use in creating territory since white has so many ways in.

An option you may have wanted to hold in reserve could be the move at B11, which would deprive white of eyes. It would be an excellent ko threat.]
;W[bi];B[ah];W[ai];B[af];W[qj];B[bl];W[ak]
(;B[qk]C[J: It would be better to press white into your stones from the other side. This would preserve your moyo.

As a general rule of thumb, first look at pushing white to your strength.]

C[J: This is best saved for end-game.];W[sh];B[ri]C[J: If you don't see a way to kill, then it would be best to hold these moves for ko threats.

;B[gl];W[gm];B[es];W[fs];B[ds];W[fr]C[Trying to do as much as possible down here... I couldn't see anything with more impact.

J: You missed your chances to reduce much more than this. You do have some pressing moves you can perform around L7. White would not be able to ignore a reduction here.]
;B[db];W[ec];B[dc];W[ie];B[kb];W[jb];B[ed];W[fc];B[ke]C[I was hoping to force W to play back inside his group (to prevent B G19, H19) and make some territory here.  W managed to live easily in sente, however, with D19.

J: It is hard to make territory here, since you are open from the bottom and R15.]

;W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[cb];W[rq]C[J: This is a very large point. It would have been best to take this instead of attacking the top. The other large point was around L7, but white got that point as well while you were attacking the top.]
;B[ia]C[This just didn't work.];W[ja];B[ga];W[ib];B[qo]C[Is this just better at S5?

J: This is fine.];W[lj];B[jl];W[jm];B[kl]C[I thought this would give me some valuable forcing moves around O7, but he blunted this easily.  M10 really hurt, since my potential area is now open from two directions...

J: You are behind at this point and it will be difficult to make up the difference.]

J: You played your start and endgames well. You ran into some difficulties in the mid-game. 

You seem like you really enjoy trying to kill groups, which led to playing several forcing moves against them. You did this with all 3 of white's smaller groups. Watch the forcing moves you play and try to limit yourself to only the ones that help you. This will allow you to fight ko's much eaiser. There was no ko in this game to exploit this.

The thing to watch for is large moyo's. When a player invests several stones forming a moyo, the other player is given numerous forcing moves against that moyo. At several points towards the start of the game, you could have kept white's moyo in check. And even towards the late mid-game there were forcing moves against the large white moyo that you could have used.

If you work on these 2 areas, games like this would turn around for you.
