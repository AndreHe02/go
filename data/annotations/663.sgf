You should learn the difference between defensive moves and attacking moves.
Contact moves are generally defensive. In this game, white played contact
moves in all four corners, where an invasion in the corner, or a simple
extension along the side, would be have been better. Contact moves always
strengthen the opponent and removes possibilities for the future.]
;B[pp];W[cd];B[cj]C[I would prefer to play E17 or E16 here. Preventing a corner enclosure is
generally considered to be important in the opening.];W[nq]
C[For the same reason, enclosing the upper left corner with E17 is perhaps
better here.];B[pn];W[qf]C[this exchange doesn't seem to come
out well for me...

After playing O3, one would normally want to follow up with Q3 or K4.
Locally, R14 is ok, if the correct follow-up is chosen.];B[qh]

(;W[qd]LB[nd:A][nc:B]C[This should be r17. (See variation.)

with a stone at A or B for instance.];B[qc];W[rd];B[pe];W[pf]

LB[qq:A][jp:B][pr:C][ec:D]C[Again, white should invade at A, or simply play B. If B, and if black def=

the corner with C, white can switch to D, which is now a very big point.]

(;W[ec]C[This is a defensive move which strengthens black and gives him a very
large upper side, while white gets very little in return. It's better to
play along the left side, attacking the lone black stone there.
(See variation.)];B[ed]C[Maybe simply F16 better for black? This makes it possible for white cross=
-cut
at F16.];W[dc];B[fd];W[ch]C[White must play C14 now.]
(;B[cm];W[cn]C[Another contact play. Simply F4 is better.];B[dm]
;W[dn];B[jd];W[df]C[Better at C14 or D15.];B[ce];W[dd];B[de]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[cf]C[in retrospect this should have
been at F15 yes?

Yes.];B[fe];W[be];B[hq];W[gq]C[This was a lousy move... One
of the problems I have is how best to counter attacks like this

To begin with, white has a weak position here, so maybe it is simply
invadable.
But if you want to attack the black stone, you must not touch it!
Contact plays strengthens the opponent, and are only used for defense.
The attacking move here is F3, or maybe even E3.];B[gr];W[fq]

to attack his upper territory after this

No, with a long series of moves (the N-line, the 8:th line) white has helped
black to strengthen his position. It is now almost impossible to reduce.
There is a proverb saying: "Don't let your opponent perfect his moyo." mean=
ing
you must invade or reduce the moyo before it's too late.];B[kg]

be at Q11 or Q10). B is another possibility, but black can also play elsewh=

corner is open, so white can reduce blacks right side.]))
