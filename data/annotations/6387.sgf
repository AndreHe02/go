C[Hello! I played black in this game from the London Open Go Congress 2007. In the beginning I felt that my opponent was too scared of me getting influence and reduced it too eagerly. I wasn't able to get any benefit from this though, and in the end the game turned into a desperate fight, which I lost after missing some key moves. I would like to hear comments about the beginning and the fighting in the middle game. Thank you for the review!

Hi, I agree with your analysis, I will see if I can point out some other ideas to profit by your opponent's mistakes.]

LB[qh:B][qr:A]C[I kind of knew I should just answer this move at A, but something kept me from doing it. I just wanted so badly to play at B, that it fogged my mind :)

--
I do not think that is so bad.  B is very big after all.];B[qh]
;W[qr]C[
--
Hm, I think this seems a little odd.  There are many possibilities here, but I think b can treat these stones lightly.]
;B[pn];W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[nn]C[I know this atari is bad, but I didn't realize it at the time.

--

Yes, definitely, after this, w got a unfairly good result.  If Q7 instead, it looks much better for b.  I think Q7 really seems better.]
;W[om];B[mo];W[mq]C[Now white is silly I think.

--

Agreed.  W is trying to make the b group a floating group, but this seems like a strange way to go about it.  This move looks like it should just end up making b thick here.]

C[I was reading all kinds of sequences in the corner, but of course I should leave this move for later, now I can't play A very well later on.

--
Yes.];W[rn];B[hc];W[mc];B[he];W[cc]C[
--

This is another strange move by w in my opinion.];B[cd];W[dc]
;B[ec];W[eb]C[
--

What about double hane here?  See var.]
(;B[fc];W[fb];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[ab];B[cn]C[I guess this checking extension is way too far from my wall, asking for trouble.

--

Seems ok to me, but these questions are difficult for someone at my level.

The reason this seems fine is even if w play as he did in the game, then he makes two weak groups.  So even if this is too far from wall, it would be difficult for w to punish because he has a weak/open position in the corner.

I would also consider F3 here, which is probably what I would play.  The situation with the M5 group is not entirely clear yet, so I would probably want to play from that side.]
;W[ck];B[en];W[fp]C[
--

Here I think b should maintain pressure on the corner.  B4 threatens C3 taking away the eyespace of two stones, but also keeps C9 stone disconnected.

If b does not play B4, w can immediately play at C5 which would be very nice for w.]
;B[ci];W[co];B[bn];W[ek]
(;B[dl]C[
--

Not really very secure here, if you were going to peep, I would do it from the other side.  This move does not really strengthen your group that much.  See variation.]
;W[dk];B[ei];W[gn]C[
--

This feels very good for w and also brings M4 weakness into play.  I think this proves that D8 and F11 sequence was not good for b.]
;B[fl]C[
--

F7 seems to be safer in this shape.  This is why D8 seems to be not much help for your shape.]
;W[el]LB[fl:A]C[I hadn't seen this white move when I played the move 'A', but luckily he answered my forcing moves and I got the connection after all.]
;B[do];W[eo];B[dn];W[cp];B[fm]C[
--

What about F5 instead?];W[fn];B[em];W[fk];B[hl];W[gk];B[hm]
;W[hk];B[je]C[
--
Looks like a good idea to me.];W[gc]C[
--
Hm, what about J18 here?  Too crazy perhaps?];B[gd];W[gb];B[ib]
LB[hb:A]C[
--

If you wanted to keep w groups separated I think H18 is more direct.  Otherwise this looks like it will end in gote, or w will be able to connect.]
;W[jb];B[ld]LB[ja:A]C[
--

This move seems a little odd now because w group can connect at H18 anytime.  Instead I would try K9 here or some similar idea.]
;W[md];B[me];W[gh]C[I didn't really know how to handle this, I was expecting him to protect his upper side group.

--

If you think that situation with upper side group was sente for b, then you should play there immediately.  Usually if your opponent ignores your sente move you should not follow him but attack the weakness he left immediately.  Otherwise he might fix some other weakness and still come back to the first weakness and you get nothing.

So here you could try K19 so at least w cannot connect, and then see what happens with the group.]
;B[gi]C[
--
This looks odd, strange shape for b.];W[hi];B[fi];W[ih];B[lc]
LB[ne:A]C[Maybe this is not the right move? I realized after the game that I really should have played A before he could, even that means letting the group survive.

--

Survival of the group is not even in question unless you start with K19 or something similar to prevent the connection.]
;W[lb];B[nb]LB[nd:A]C[
--
Bad move, "thank you move" in my opinion.  Should play O16 instead.]
;W[mb];B[ja];W[ka];B[ia];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf]C[
--

Why not cut here?  Let the top live in gote, then attack the center group, while taking two stones profit.

O14 move would look immediately silly if you cut it.];B[mg]
;W[ng];B[nh]C[
--

Again, why not cut?];W[od];B[pd];W[pe]C[I thought this was a blunder.

--
Oh, I see now... you were trying to kill everything.  I think that is kind of unreasonable, but better would be to take profit in sente and attack w center group next in my opinion.]
;B[pg];W[og];B[oh];W[pf]LB[le:B][mh:A]C[Here I didn't dare take his eyes away because of my cutting points, A and B.

--

Hm.  I think you can try it.  Cutting points are not so bad, you should have a view to make him live and then still attack center group.]
;B[hg]C[I thought I could maybe strengthen myself first and then take the eyes away :)

--

It is not likely you could kill the top I think but the center is weaker.

I think this attack is somewhat from the wrong side though, as w can simply play K9 and your attack is over.  So I would attack from that side instead.]
;W[qg];B[ph];W[qe]C[
--

Here I think w makes his group unconditionally alive, but also threatening the corner, however... he left alone the center group which is under attack.

I think you must be bold.  Attack the center group.  If the center group is not alive, even if your corner could also be killed, w will not win.  So w must defend center group now against your attack.  Start with K9 or something.]
;B[rd];W[re];B[ji]LB[hh:A]C[I guess I should have just cut at A, but I wanted to attack on a large scale.

--
I think I would try K9, but attack on a large scale is good, I agree.  This K11 though looks a little odd since H8 side is much weaker!]
;W[ik]LB[kk:B][kl:C][jm:A]C[Now I missed the obvious play at A, and he punishes me from it quite seriously.

--

B or C maybe also are OK.  You can just make sure your left stones can still connect and b has a good game here.]
;B[ii]C[
--

This seems bizarre, too territory-oriented, not thinking enough about the weakness of the H7 stones, and too clever by half.]
;W[jm];B[in];W[jn];B[jo];W[hh];B[kk]C[I thougt I got back to the game with this move, but I was in time trouble and couldn't think very well in the continuation.]
;W[ij]LB[jl:B][ho:A]C[Maybe I should just play at A now, but I didn't want to let him get away with the centre group.

--

I would play B here (K8).  Take away your worries about the cut, but still looking at the center group.]

(;B[ll]C[
--

This is similar to my K8 idea but seems less secure.];W[bi]
;B[bh];W[if];B[hf];W[kh];B[mi]C[
--
For some reason I think M12 feels better.];W[cj];B[ch]LB[io:A]
C[My notes end here, but he later cut at A and captured my stones on the left, and soon after that I lost on time.

--

W still has zero eyes in the center here so I think b has played a good game.  I think if not for time pressure, b has a good chance to kill this.]
