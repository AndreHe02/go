C[Hi! First I want to thank you in advance for helping me to improve. Well, this game is from the 2nd round from the Argentinian Tournament (28 play, switz).
I wasn't very lucky with the drawings, my first game was against Fernando Aguilar(7d), and this one Roberti Alaluf(4d). Really because of the difference in ranks(I'm 2k) I was totally hopeless, but it turned to be an even(well, not that much) game. Well, sorry for this long passage, i'll try to make shorter coments. JMB

Dieter Verhofstadt: My comments will be signed (dv). Personally, I like reviewees to make comments beforehand.]
;B[pp]C[(dv) I'm not going to say too much about the opening. Although the opening is the part I'm working on the most for the moment, I still don't feel I can say much useful about it.]
;W[cd];B[pc];W[dq];B[co];W[ck]LB[dm:a][dl:b][pe:c][qe:d]C[(dv) White 6 has the good idea: pincer and extension at the time. But it is rather unusual. I found six professional games following the fuseki up til 5. White 6 is once at 'a', twice at 'b', three times at 'c' and once at 'd'. The fact that pros often tenuki here is nice to remember.]
;B[dn];W[fp];B[bq];W[iq]LB[jq:a]C[I
thnik this looks like constrained, i think the joseki is k3, but i'm not
sure. Anyway, i was afraid because of his strength, I guess.

(dv): It is a matter of style, I think. 10 and 'a' are both possible. Whether you play tightly or extend widely, a stronger player's strength will show itself anyway. There is no reason to play moves you would'nt play against players of your own level.]
;B[ec];W[df];B[gd]C[(dv) The configuration occurring in the top left, including W6, is found in 4 pro games on gobase.org. Here, White 6 looks like an extension from the 2-12 basis, which is coming too close to Black's stable position. Making good use of the unusual move at 6 looks like the challenge for White.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[ci]LB[cl:a][pe:b][nq:c]C[This is my second doubt, I spent a lot of minutes in this one(like 4)
I considered D12(joseki);D11 and E9
I think the one I played was extremely careful

(dv) It is too careful, I agree. If W6 were at 'a', this move would work better. White must play faster and approach at b or c. The stone at 6 is not so important, so it does not need urgent defense.]
;B[ld]
(;W[pe]LB[qf:a]C[I didn't know what to do here

(dv) A useful alternative is 'a'];B[ph]C[(dv) With this ideal attack, Black has a nice opening. He definitely has the initiative.]

(;W[ne];B[nc]
(;W[mf]C[(dv) White is not really accomplishing anything except giving Black a nice heavy target to attack. See var at 20.]
;B[pk];W[nq]C[(dv) Obviously the biggest point.];B[np];W[mp]
;B[no];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[op];W[mr];B[mo]
(;W[lp]C[(dv) This is the kind of move I'd play too: "4th line territory" you know. But again it is too slow. Black's next move makes a moyo while attacking. See var.]
;B[mh];W[kf];B[jd]C[(dv) And more territory while attacking. Well, I guess you felt bad enough about this development already.]

(;W[qg]C[what about this sequence? 40-42-44

(dv) 40 is a move to avoid like the plague. I understand you are looking for breathing room, but 40 doesn't really give any. See var.]
;B[qh];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb];W[kh];B[fg]C[I was really afraid of the cut at M13 because of the ladder breaker of F13
See Var

(dv)  See var. I don't like Black's move either: it turns White 16 into a good move.]

(;W[mg]C[(dv) I think you are right about reinforcing here after Black's slack play.]
;B[nh];W[lk]C[I needed to reduce it someway];B[ki];W[lh];B[li]

(;W[lo]LB[kn:a]C[(dv) The double hane has to be foreseen. Keima at 'a' instead of 54 looks better: see var.]
;B[ln];W[kn];B[km];W[lm];B[mn]
(;W[kl];B[jm]C[(dv) You cannot play this way. I suggest you accept Black's moyo becoming territory and compete with one of your own, although that simplifies the game and Black is winning. See var.]
;W[jl];B[ko]
(;W[kp]C[I read some critics in the kibitz because of the importance of 56, what dos u think?

(dv) See my critics on their critics and my suggestion.];B[ji]

(;W[hl];B[jn];W[jh]C[(dv) It is the other group which needs defense.]
;B[gn];W[gk]LB[ek:a]C[I also read this is bad shape, but i don't know i don't see it that bad.
I considered F8, but taught that he could cut me(then I reviewed it and I think it was no that easy to do it)

(dv) I don't know about the shape, but it definitely does not connect neither does it provide eyeshape. Black can still attack at 'a'. 70 is heavy. You should include the possibility of sacrificing a few stones like 50-58.]

;B[kd];W[md];B[mc];W[id];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[nk]LB[cg:a][gq:b]
C[I knew this was dangerous
because of E9 or something, but i needed to reduce it.
what are your estimates at this instance?

(dv) Black top 30 White bottom 30
Black right 20 White left 20

But Black is much much stronger: his territory is 100% sure whereas White has troublesoume invasions at a and b to cope with. Add to that the weak group in the center and Black's victory is almost certain.]

but it was very bad, I didn't notice M8 was sente for him];B[qm]
;W[jo];B[ll];W[kj];B[pm]
(;W[rf]C[was here something better to play?

dv: If there is any occasion for you to take the initiative it is here. The only weakness left in B's position is the lower left. Grabbing some points in sente there should be possible. See var.]
;B[rg]C[well
there is nothing punctual ahead, just little yose points, I think I played
them very badly, like the whole yose, i thnk I'm very weak there, what can
yo see in this game?
Well, i know I was maybe insistent, i'll understand if it takes much time to review it, i won't complain! :-)
Thank you Again

dv : I don't think the yose was so bad, neither was it decisive. You lost the advantage by creating that weak group at the top right. Black's slow move 47 gave you a chance to settle it. Next both B and W made mistakes in treating the confused situation 50-68. Black's attack on the other weak group led to an exchange of territories. The damage to his territory was bigger than what you suffered. Black 163 was a very big move, which secured victory in my opinion.]

(;W[jn]C[(dv) So they want you to play this way ? White can't play on both sides like this. With 60, White has made a choice and abandons the points below in order to save the invading stones.]

(;W[jm];B[kl];W[jl];B[kk];W[fn];B[jn];W[ko];B[jk];W[hm]C[(dv) Let's count this.

White   Left and Top left: 20
bottom: 40
Top right and komi: 10

Black:   Top: 30
Right: 45+ given weakness white top group
Lower left: 5+

So, White is 10 points behind and the endgame doesn't leave too much room for a comeback. Moreover, Black can start it. If this was your motivation for starting a fight with 60, I can understand.]

However, Black gets sente to develop even more. I guess that can not be helped right now. Getting out of trouble first, then look what can be done about the moyo, seems appropriate.]

(;W[mi];B[lp];W[mq]LB[lo:a]C[(dv) Normally, Black's atari is too good to allow. But here White 4-8-10 has a mitigating effect. Black's position is still better (higher), but the cut at 'a' is left and the white stones at the top right are getting out of danger.]
