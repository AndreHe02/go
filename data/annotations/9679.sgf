1. I think my move at T4 was too slow but I was worried about losing the corner, was that move necessary?

2. I feel like I didn't know how to continue attacking white to
reduce his big territory in the middle, and especially the move G11
did not do much. I say this because white ended up forming a strong
wall with stones H10 and H8, so it only decreased his territory by
about 12-15pts (but then I couldn't form eyes so it failed anyway).

Any tips on how to reduce white in a better way would be
appreciated.

Thanks so much, of course please give any other comments.

TM: Hi, my name is Tom치코 and will review your game. To answer your questions first:

1. T4 should have been at S3, otherwise it's ok. White seems to be ahead, but is not lost yet. The G17 (move 25) is a little slow, but still playable. It's the development in the upper-right corner and subsequent development on the left side that gave white the whole center and lost you the game.

2. G11 was too late. White should not have got such a strong center in the first place.

I will go through the game and leave comments and variations at the moves that you should concentrate on.

Best wishes
