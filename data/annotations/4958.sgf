;B[pd]C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game. I rarely play moyo games, but here is one. I had a hard time and would like your help.

Assuming i want to play a moyo game, is there any better moves i could have made in the opening?]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[qp]C[I'd play Q4 if I wanted to play a moyo game.]
;B[id];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[dj];W[kp];B[cn];W[fp]LB[dn:A]C[If you can see to here our moyo's are identical, how do you think i could have done better on the moyo side of things

Everything looks OK so far.  You could consider A but I like to keep things simple in the fuseki.]
;B[op];W[oq]LB[pn:A]C[Wrong direction - you already have a pincer on this side.  I'd play A instead.]
;B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[pn]C[too far, Q5 better or R6?

Q5 looks better.  Q6 has some weakness in shape.];B[qo];W[po]
;B[pp];W[qq]C[S4 insted?

Yes.];B[ro];W[qm];B[or];W[pr];B[nr]
(;W[lq]C[here is a mistake balck get's the vital point of S2, if i had gone S2 then he could have L2, how would white continue after L2?]
;B[rr]LB[ip:A]C[This is a tremendous loss for W.  Though it is still early, W is quite behind after giving up such a big corner.

Now J4 is a weak spot for W];W[rp];B[sp];W[ec];B[dc];W[ed];B[df]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[ff];B[gc]C[best next move?];W[dg]LB[fh:A]C[I would play A to make sure this group is safe and out into the centre.  The group is too weak to play a fighting move such as D13.]
;B[ef];W[eg];B[cf]LB[fg:A]C[B should cut at A];W[gf];B[cg];W[ei]
;B[di];W[eh]C[B has made alot of profit, while W has made a group in the center that is not 100% safe.  B's lead is increasingly clear and it's not even 50 moves yet.

Worse yet, B has sente!  W has a very difficult game ahead of him.]
;B[if];W[ej];B[dk];W[em]LB[fl:A]C[A is more solid];B[ek];W[fk]

;W[ds];B[es]
(;W[lj]C[is this the best move, or there an extreamly important move elsewhere? (bottem left)

Why not play the ko at H2?];B[of];W[ph];B[re];W[rf];B[qe]LB[le:A]
C[can i still invade the top, how?

It would be really difficult.  The deepest I'd enter is around A.]
;W[rn];B[so];W[cm];B[dn]TR[gk][fl][hl][hm][kn][go][ko]C[I start a fight, any tips?

You should be careful when starting fights here as the marked B stones still have alot of aji.  However, you do have the ko at H2.]

Megalith [7k\]: thx
kilroy [6k\]: i wasn't going to let you lose on time like taht
Megalith [7k\]: :)
kilroy [6k\]: it seemed like an internet thing anyways

I didn't want him to lose because of time, he seemed to play all his moves slow and lose because of his interent. Thank you for looking at my game and can you please tell me any things i can do to improve? Kilroy

Unfortunately, you fell behind with the result in the lower right corner and then made the game more difficult with the result on the left side.

Try to be patient, and make strong shapes.  Strong shapes make it easier to fight and will carry you through the endgame, which is usually the last 100-150 moves.]
