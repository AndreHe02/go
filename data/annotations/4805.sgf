C[Hi,
I tried to analyse it by myself, but I couldn't find what I've made wrong.
Game was very even, although I ,almost all game from the beginning,  thinked that I was loosing, and I had no chance to win.
So I play calmly and a litle bit bravely, like for me. I was really surprised that he resigned and I was leading at the end by about 8 points.

Thanks for review,
Paul];B[pd]C[Mattias> Hi! I am your reviewer for tonight and I will try to see what you can do better in your games in the future.]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]LB[jd:a][jc:b][fc:c]C[Mattias> This early in the opening of the game you migt want to play a bit larger moves like a, b or c.]

Earlier I was afraid and avoid them.
So I didn't if it work out.

Should I play at L17 yet?

[pc:b][fh:c][bi:d][lr:e][rj:f][ro:g]C[Mattias> Before you place a stone on the board. Take a quick look around the board and look if you can find a larger point to play. This move is not big. An invasion at C17 is big. There are several moves that are bigger than M15. I have marked some here.]
