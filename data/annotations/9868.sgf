C[Hi Tamingo

I offered you 7 questions to think about

Q1 - 150-151 - look for cutting points in close combat
Q2 - 100-101 - how to win fights: count liberties
Q3 - 88-89 - think big in a fight (strategic evaluation)
Q4 - 76-77 - another haengma: the one space jump instead of the empty triangle 
Q5 - 72-73 - haengma: avoid "hane at the head" or "ja choong soo"
Q6 - 64-65 - understanding the size of a ko and the impact of a threat (this is the most interesting but also the hardest evaluation in the game)
Q7 - 20-21 - diagonals and keimas, a "haengma" to remember

The reason why I ask them backwards is that I believe games are decided near the end, not the beginning. So, it makes sense to invest in improving end game, or fighting that occurs when liberties become scarce.

Based on this game alone, but also in general I would recommend the following reads:

Haengma tutorial for beginners - by Kang U Min, at Sensei's Library
Counting Liberties and Winning Capturing Races - a book by Richard Hunter, some material also present in Second book of Go by Richard Bozulich

This will equip you with basic technique and basic tactics in fighting.
Good luck and enjoy the game of Go.];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[pq]

dv: As said, your opening skills and middle game strategy are very good. You will increase your winning percentage by paying attention to basic technique and counting liberties when fighting.

I hope you enjoyed the review and feel free to come back any time.

(;B[ee]LB[gd:A]SQ[fc][cf]C[there's an intrinsic relationship between a diagonal move and a keima opposition of stones; the triangled move separates the white stones perfectly; next Black can aim at A for another such relationship of diagonal and keima, in order to gain more influence
