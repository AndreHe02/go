;W[pe]C[JB: This is a very risky move.  Joseki, of course, is for white to play around K4 or K3.  If you get there first his 3 stones would be heavy and in trouble. White is hoping to make some progress in the upper right, exit with sente, and come back to patch the lower side.]
(;B[qg]C[JB: Why play a complex joseki?  If you can finish with sente, you can hurt him on the lower side.  See variation.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pd];B[qe];W[qf];B[rf]C[JB: You're in an obscure line of a complex joseki, which is like flipping a coin for sente.]
;W[pf];B[oc];W[rc]C[JB: A terrible move by your opponent.  You have weaknesses at S15 and S13.  ( FWIW, joseki is to exploit those weaknesses by cutting at S13. )  Even if one does not know the joseki here, it is counter productive to force one's opponent to fix a weakness.]
;B[re]C[JB: Now Q17 is a dangerous cutting stone.];W[nc]C[25 is my first big mistake i think, just a reading error on my part so i don't konow if there is much to say about it. R18 or some such oucht to have ended up more favorebale for back. 

JB: Even the best of us make oversights in reading.  I wouldn't worry about it too much.
What I would be concerned about is the error in direction of play suggested in your comment.  R18 is a bad move.  Maybe it kills.  But who cares?  If he wants to live in the corner, it will be living small and living in gote - which is almost as bad as dying.
Your first impulse - to push outward - is the correct direction.  Sure, you could read a bit and conclude that the hane is too thin, and then you should settle on the stronger push outward at P16.  See variation on the next move.]
(;B[nd];W[od]C[JB: This is unfortunate.  But Q17 is so important that you might fight to save it.  See variation]
(;B[mc];W[nb]C[JB: You are playing aji keshi.  Your Q17 stone is dangerous, so he wants to kill it.  And you are forcing him to ensure that it dies.]
;B[md]LB[pg:A]C[JB: Fortunately he does not realize that this is not sente.  ( BTW, Q13 is still a big sente for you )]
;W[pb]C[I'm not to sure about black 31, my intention was to hinder white from getting a good  double extension.]
(;B[jp]C[JB: Good idea. ( L4 would be just a bit better.  It leaves him less room for an eye. )
But you have created the exact same weakness for yourself up top, and your overall loss is bigger.  See variation.]
;W[ic]C[Not to sure about back 33 ether, would a jump to F15 been more appropriate?
JB: Hard to say.  There is no really good play here, after white got the spot that you wanted.]

JB: It does keep your guys connected, whereas C6 starts another group.]
(;B[cn];W[hr]C[Black 57 ought definately have come to better use, D5 maybie? Or a big point like somehere arround R11 or C11, D10?

JB: The fact that you ask this indicates that you are not putting enough emphasis on making your groups safe.  H3 is really the only move here.  ( Of course, if it looks submissive and small, you are right: it is.  You should have defended one move earlier with G2 )]
(;B[hq];W[cl]
(;B[en]C[JB: It may be too much trouble to hold onto this stone.  See variation.]
;W[ci];B[dh]C[A comment on this move?

JB: It may be the best in a bad situation.  Your stones are looking weak, so you have to do something.  But better than this is to make your group strong first - BEFORE YOU PLAY C6 - then this kind of problem won't arise.]
;W[bg]C[Would D11 have bin a better respeonce cocidering my emergin moyo? I playde B14 for fear of beeing cut of and  losing acces to the corner, giving white a lot of points.

JB: I think that the moyo is too thin, because white H14 pushes in too easily.]

JB: CLOSING COMMENTS:
The best way for you to improve is to become more conscious of weak groups and strong groups.  You start groups, make them big enough such that you cannot afford to lose them, then you start another group.  I recommend either making your groups safe, or if it is not worth your time to make them safe, abandon them while they are small.

Notice how your opponent plays.  On move 61, he starts a group.  His next eight consectutive moves are dedicated to making that group safe. He does not quit until he knows that it is alive.
Again, on move 86 he starts a group.  Except for move 96, where you force him to defend elsewhere, his next ten consectutive moves are all aimed at making his group alive. ( FWIW, his decision to start the group with 86 is dubious, but one he commits himself, he follows through )

Also, look at the variation that I proposed for move 58.  When black starts a group in the corner, he does not quit until it is safe.  Conversely, the stone at C6 is abandoned without making it too big to lose.

It works the other way too.  Not only should you be checking on your own groups, but you should watch your opponent's groups to see if they are safe or not.  Over on the right side, around move 100, he had two weak groups, but you did not attack them.

Make a new habit: every three or four moves, stop and take inventory of all the groups on the board, both yours and his.  Ask yourself questions like "Is this group too big too lose?", and "Is it safe?".  Make decisions about your groups, like "I'm going to make this alive", or "It is not worth my time to worry about that stone".
When making such decisions, it is not all that important that you be correct, but that you be decisive.  Commit to either saving groups or abandoning them.

Once you start checking on whether your groups are weak or strong, then start a policy of allowing yourself no more than one big weak group.  Having two groups means that he may be able to make a dual attack, and thus kill one of them.  
Conversely, if your opponent is careless enough to make two weak groups, try to make them heavy enough that he cannot afford to sacrifice them. ( Peeping at a one-space jump is an example of this technique )  Then try to make moves that threaten both simultaneously.

I hope this helps.];W[jo];B[lp];W[ks];B[lq];W[kr];B[ln];W[mq]
