;W[eo]L[cp]C[See joseki variation at `a.']
(;B[en];W[cp];B[cm]L[cn]C[I like the  strong connection at `a' better.  This leaves an unnecessary weakness
behind.];W[gp];B[jd]L[cj][dj]C[I think this leaves you weak on  the left side.  Perhaps a stone at `a' or `b'  would be better.]
;W[qf];B[qe]L[pj][nd][qc]C[Attaching here is generally  a bad strategy unless you already have a stone around `a.'
Better to calmly slide to `b' or perhaps try a pincer.  If you make a pincer,  expect
white to invade the corner immediately at `c.'];W[pf];B[of]L[nd]C[I think this can  get you into trouble.  Most players will slide to `a' instead.]
;W[gd];B[hd]L[jf]C[Attaching moves generally strengthen the opponent.  Attach  for defense, but play
away from your opponent's stones to attack.  Unfortunately, in this  situation, if
you approach white from the right, he can invade the weak left side; if you  approach
from the left, he can take advantage of your weakness in the upper right.  I  would
try an unprovocative move like `a.'];W[ge];B[gc];W[ed];B[ec];W[fc];B[fb]

(;W[gb]C[This is a mistake for white.  See variation.];B[fd];W[fe];B[ee]
;W[hc];B[fc];W[he];B[id];W[ie]L[gg]C[This move doesn't accomplish much.   Better for white to jump out to `a.']
;B[hb]L[mc]M[jd][id][hd]C[This move  isn't really necessary.  Instead, I'd try to connect the marked stones
to the upper right corner, with a move like `a.'];W[pi]C[Too  short an extension for white.]
;B[di]C[Good.  A very big point.];W[eg];B[dg];W[ef];B[df];W[ei];B[ek];W
[fj]L[je]C[Turning at `a' would now be quite nice.];B[eh];W[fh];B[dh]
;W[fg];B[ej]L[qn][nq]C[This is a small move,  and serves to strengthen white.  Better to get deep into white's
moyo with `a' or `b.'];W[fi];B[le];W[lf];B[me];W[mf];B[nf];W[nh];B[pg]C
[You're getting caught up in the local situation.  A deep invasion on the  bottom or right
is called for now, before white gets too strong.];W[qg];B[oh]C[You're leaving  a lot of cutting points behind...taking large risks for small profits.]
;W[oi];B[kf];W[ke];B[je];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[md];W[ne];B[mg];W[lg];B[jg]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[mh];B[oe];W[nd];B[mc];W[pe];B[qc];W[pm];B[fo]C[Too timid.  This is a good  time to invade the bottom, before white solidifies it.]
;W[fp];B[gl];W[hj];B[gk]C[Again, this will strengthen white, without helping you all that much.]
;W[gj];B[jj];W[ik];B[jk];W[il];B[od]M[jj][jg]C[Is this necessary?  White can  still break the connection between the marked stones,
and that could make life difficult for you in the middle.];W[in];B[ng];W
[li];B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[lj];B[kj]C[This move is unnecessary, since the diagonal  connection you had was unbreakable.]
;W[jn];B[jm]L[nq][jl]C[The bottom is  getting much too solid.  I still like `a.'  Besides, white can easily
cut this stone off with `b.'];W[im];B[km];W[jp];B[ko];W[kp];B[oo]L[nq]
[qq]C[This makes things too easy for white, either on the right or  on the bottom.  The approach
at `a' is still good, or you can just dive into the corner at `b.'];W[nq]
;B[op];W[pq];B[om]L[po]C[You're forcing white to make strong connections.   How about starting with a
turn at `a,' to put more weaknesses in white's wall?];W[pn];B[nj];W[ni]
;B[lk];W[ok];B[nk];W[kn];B[lo]L[ln]C[I might just abandon the marked stone,  using it's presence to help you connect the
rest in this area.  Just block at `a.'];W[lq]L[ln]C[This should probably be at  `a,' making it difficult for you to connect everything.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[ln];W[ol];B[nl];W[on];B[nn]L[nm]C[I think it's better to connect at `a.']
;W[nm];B[mm];W[no];B[np];W[mn];B[ml]L[lm]C[I don't think this  connection is necessary.  If white cuts here, you connect at `a,'
and white's cutting stone is lost.];W[mj];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh];W[og];B[rg]

L[bo]C[This  is very small at this point.  Perhaps the biggest point left is `a.']
;W[ij];B[ii];W[go];B[gn]L[fn]C[Just connect at `a.'];W[fn];B[fm];W[fo]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[hl];W[bo]C[This was big.];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[bq]C[I don't think  this is necessary for white.]
