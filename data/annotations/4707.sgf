C[Hi David,

I think the main problem that you had in this game was envy. It looked like you were not prepared to let black have any part of the board. The result was that you made numerous overplays. Some of these overplays could have been avoided through reading the situation more carefully, others could have been avoided if you had been less intent on the local fighting and considered the global situation; A couple of times you basically force black to make your stones weak. 

To work on these problems I would suggest that you practice life and death problems (we all need to improve our reading) and go over a few of Shusaku's games. The reason that I suggest Shusaku's games is that they are very solid and mostly calm. Hopefully you will see the patience of those professionals, where they prepare and wait for the right time to attack rather than charging in rashly.

The R4 group is not 100% safe so defending is important. The problem is that black gains strength by attack on the right, and at the same time increases the relative weakness of the white N3 group. This is called a splitting attack.]

(;W[cn]C[* This is strong but heavy. It is also clear that black will jump out to E8, so you should have a plan for dealing with that. This move looks like you want to prevent C8 from connecting to the black group on the bottom. That kind of counter-attack seems a little unreasonable given blacks strength in the area.]

* yes... but perhaps not so simple. Your group can live if you don't play L6, but I you would need to read the situation pretty carefully to see that it is safe. If you do tenuki you will only get a couple of points from this group, but potentially you could make more profit overall. Playing G12 instead of L6 looks good to me. Unfortunately, by playing L6, you give black sente so that he can attack your moyo.]
