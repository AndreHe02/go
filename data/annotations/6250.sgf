AB[pd][dp][pp];W[dd]C[Hi Markus,

This game was very interesting.
I liked reviewing it.

Your questions showed me, that you could not see the other problems I wanted to explain to you.

If you liked this comment, you can get more :)

(;B[nc]C[good move, but this position is ideal to use a pincer]
;W[qi]
(;B[kc]C[Better play one of the variations?

This is a good choice, if you want to stabilize. The variations are not so good.

you don't get too much territory here, because O17 is only 3rd row, a low stone.

You may look at other possibilities];W[qn];B[np];W[cn]
(;B[dl]C[now, a pincer is much more difficult, because no group helps the lonely stone at D8

This move is not bad, but complicated];W[fq]
(;B[fo]C[A bit to dangerous i think. Better E5?

good analysed! 
The two stones may be cut in two later on,
w can live with h3];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[do]C[I don't like it, because f5 is too near, 
difficult to find a better move];W[bl]
(;B[fd]C[good move, but

white played too far, you did not see that his stones are two weak.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ec]TR[dd]C[this is nearly never a good way to come near a stone on the 4th line. Diagonal is too near!]

(;W[cc]C[white makes it easy for you.
now E17 looks good! :)]
(;B[he]C[good idea, I don't like the shape];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[no, nay, never

The first move I would call a mistake];W[qd]C[much too easy for w]

(;B[cj]TR[qk][ql]C[good point, but not good enaugh.
you only reduce territory, you do not fight
You should see the gap at R8, R9];W[qq];B[pq]C[ah, again,
sorry,];W[qp]
(;B[ch]C[To slow?

Maybe you are right, but this move seems to build moyo]
(;W[bh];B[bi];W[bg];B[dh];W[ef]
(;B[dg]LB[gg:B][fh:A]C[Better at A or B i think.

absolutely right,
the second move I would like to call a mistake];W[gf];B[fg]

(;B[po]TR[qf]C[Should have killed triangel?
yes, yes, yes, why not? it is sente];W[qg];B[om]C[good!];W[hp]

(;B[gp]C[no!
don't push into keima if you don' want to cut the keima];W[gq]

(;B[iq]C[good move, but better without G4, G3];W[hq];B[ho];W[ip]
;B[jq];W[io]TR[gf]C[now please look:
there are two examples of pressing white toothpaste into your area: G14 and J5.
What a mess

That comes from attacking too closely];B[hn]C[good];W[in];B[hm]
;W[jl]
(;B[im]LB[kn:A]C[Better to play at A?

I don't know,
If you want to fight, you are right with J7]
(;W[jn]C[this way your move looks nice]
(;B[ko]C[oh, what a pity,

please look:
it seems to be a peep, and white did not respont, so cut!];W[jm]
C[w repaired it];B[ik]C[good];W[gg];B[fh]C[good];W[gh];B[gi]
C[good];W[bk];B[ck]C[not good, play tenuki!];W[bj]
(;B[ql]C[ok, but maybe complicated, you should attack without cutting points]

(;W[rl];B[qk];W[rk];B[qm];W[rm]
(;B[le]C[To slow, maybe J12 or K11 better.

Sorry, no. You suggest lukewarm moves.
Your move is good!];W[eq]C[bad choice];B[dr]C[yes!];W[er];B[cr]

the other side and a lot of interisting moves];W[fs];B[ds]C[oh dear, you had sente,
