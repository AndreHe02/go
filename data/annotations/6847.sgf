AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,thanks for your time.
In this game i played black with 2H against 5d(currently 6d)
my main questions are about upper left corner where i made heavy group and generally about my tactical mistakes.

----------------

Hi!

My name is Jon and I'll be providing the commentary for your review.  My comments start with "Jon:".]
;W[cd];B[pq];W[po];B[qm];W[on];B[mq]
(;W[qq]C[Jon:  This is a bad exchange for white, trying to get in this attachment in the corner makes white heavier while allowing black to strengthen both of his groups.

What should white do instead?]
(;B[qp]C[i wasnt sure about this move,maybe r2 is better?

Jon:  Yeah, the hane at R-2 is simpler and makes it harder for white to get a good result.]
;W[pp];B[qo];W[oq];B[pr];W[nq];B[qr];W[mp]
(;B[iq]C[m3 seemed heavy here

Jon:  I agree, trying to pull out at M-3 wouldn't be worth the effort required to save it.]

(;W[lq]LB[gq:A][hq:B]C[Jon:  Locally, I like this a lot for strengthening this group, but in the overall picture, considering that it's a handicap game, it's way too slow.   I'd like to play more aggressively and take a big point elsewhere.

Where's a big point white should take?

Also, on the bottom, regardless of timing, this move makes J-3 feel a bit uneasy, black has to worry about the invasion at white A later on.  It's too early to worry about strengthening J-3 right now, but you have to keep it in mind.  Because of this, I would consider playing J-3 at B instead to make an invasion there slightly less troubling for black.]
;B[ed];W[hd];B[ef];W[cg]
(;B[cc]C[Jon:  This move is necessary, but it's one step too early.

What should black do instead?];W[bc]C[perhaps playing k16 was better here?

Jon:  Not sure what you're referring to here, do you mean black K-16 instead of C-17?   C-17's not a bad move, it was just played too early.]

(;B[dc]LB[cc:A][lc:B][eh:C]C[Jon:  Black doesn't have time to draw back and save the stone at A, white can freely settle his pincer stone by extending to B now.

What should black do instead?];W[lc]TR[cc][dc][ed][ef]C[Jon:  White is very happy to settle on the top, black's marked stones aren't feeling useful at all now.]

(;B[be]TR[cc][dc][ed][ef]C[Jon:  It's too early to make this reduction.  Black needs to worry about getting the marked black stones out of danger first before he can play this.

What's the best way for black to get the marked stones out of danger?]
;W[bd];B[ce];W[de];B[dd];W[ae];B[df];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[ee]
;W[af];B[de];W[ck]C[bad shape for black

Jon:  Yeah, and black doesn't have a base either, so he's in a lot of trouble here.  The problem was the reduction at B-15, it was made while black's stones were unstable.]
;B[bb]LB[eh:A]C[Jon:  Trying to make a base in the corner is too small at the moment, so I'd prefer to get out into the center by jumping down to A instead.]
;W[ab]
(;B[ca]C[Jon:  This isn't the best way to protect the cutting point, it doesn't threaten as much damage to white.

Can you find a better way to defend locally?];W[fq]
(;B[cm]LB[fq:A]TR[dp][iq]C[Jon:  Neglecting to maintain the connectivity between the two marked black stones is dangerous, but this also doesn't put any pressure on the invading white stone at A.  

Can you find a better way to respond to white's invasion at A?]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[co];B[cn]
LB[dn:A]C[Jon:  For simplicity's sake, I would consider extending straight up to A to avoid leaving the aji of the cut.]
;W[fo];B[gq];W[fr];B[fp];W[gp];B[ep];W[hq];B[gr];W[hr];B[fs]
;W[hp]
(;B[bn]LB[bo:A]C[Jon:  If you want to make this exchange first, you can destroy more of white's bottom left corner by making the hane at A instead.]
;W[bo];B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[cj];B[bh];W[di];B[ch];W[dh];B[ai]
;W[dg];B[ah];W[ag];B[bk];W[en];B[dn];W[gh];B[hf];W[ih];B[ej]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[fg];B[ff]C[i had to answer each peep but maybe there was better options?

Jon:  I found one way to resist white G-15 (with black F-13), but it isn't much better.  Other than that, I don't see much else by way of resistance.]
;W[jd];B[hi];W[hh];B[fi];W[fh];B[jf];W[el];B[dj];W[fk];B[dl]
;W[fj]
(;B[dk]LB[jf:A]TR[fi][hi][dj][ej]C[Jon:  Because black can't get much more out of the attack on the escaping white stones, these marked black stones aren't as important anymore, so what if you tried to press into the center from the stone at A?]
;W[kh];B[gi]LB[lf:A]C[Jon:  The attack on white's stones is basically finished now, so this connection is an overplay.  Getting out the black stones on the top left with the jump to A wouldn't hurt, but white's center is looking very large right now, so you'll have to prepare to do something about it soon.]
;W[ei];B[kj]LB[lj:A]C[Jon:  This feels reasonable as a reduction into the center, I would also consider putting it at A to be slightly more careful.]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[ii];B[jh];W[jg]C[it seems like i wanted too much

Jon:  Definitely, the black stones in the top left are being damaged in the process too.]
;B[ie];W[id];B[kg];W[ig]LB[if:A]C[Jon:  This is painful for black, white can now cut off black's escape route with the push at A.]

(;B[lh]LB[kf:A]C[Jon:  Black stretched too thin by leaving the cutting point at A.  It's more important to connect there to prevent white from taking advantage of this weakness in black's escape route as easily.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[fc]LB[if:A]C[Jon:  In the actual game, white doesn't have to spend another move at around A to finish the separation, so this is a lot more troubling for black.

At this point, the game is in white's favor, so this is the last comment.  Please see move 145 for the final summary.]

Thanks for the review.


Jon:  Here are the most important points for this game:

1.)  Simplicity was the key issue at move 8 in the bottom right corner.  Sometimes you'll find that the simple choice is the best one.

2.)  Move 16 at J-3 was a nice idea, pressuring white's bottom right group without getting stuck worrying about saving a single stone (N-3).

3.)  In the top left corner:

       A.)  When setting up a counterattack in those kinds of fights, it's best to move the pincered stone out of danger first, then prevent the connection underneath with the attachment in the corner (e.g. black C-17).

       B.)  Peeping underneath white's corner stones should only be done when the stones you're attacking from are stable.

(;B[kf];W[if];B[he];W[je]C[Jon:  White has to make the last move to finish the separation, so black gets sente to make the first move in the top left.]
;B[gd]LB[ge:A]C[Jon:  Having sente allows black to cut off the stone at A, making it much easier to live.]

(;B[kg]TR[ab][bc][bd][cd][ae][af][cf][ag][bg][cg][dg][fg][dh]
[fh][gh][hh][ih][di]C[Jon:  This kosumi would give the black stones on the top more room to move around while beginning to push into the center.]
))
(;B[bo];W[bp];B[bn];W[ar];B[ci]C[Jon:  White's bottom left corner is a bit smaller now.]
))
(;B[fp]C[Jon:  Attaching on top is black's best option, it pressures the invading stone while preventing white from tearing the two black stones apart without a fight.]
))
(;B[ba]LB[ad:A]C[Jon:  Extending straight up is the best move.  Now black threatens to capture some white stones with the throw-in at A.]
))
(;B[eh]LB[bb:A]C[Jon:  Moving into the center is black's best option.  He can also settle directly by making the hane in the corner at A, but it's so small that you don't want to do it unless you absolutely need to make a base and have no alternative.]
))
(;B[eh]LB[kd:A]C[Jon:  I'm not totally confident in starting the counterattack at A without safely moving the pincered black stones out, so I'd prefer to get them out first.]
))
(;B[eh]LB[hd:A]C[Jon:  Because the white pincer stone at A is two points away, I'd like to jump out one more time to make sure these black stones have enough strength to counterattack.  I also don't want them to fall into trouble once the counterattack is started, so having them further out into the center helps with that too.]
;W[di];B[cc];W[bc];B[kd]LB[hd:A][eh:1][di:2]TR[ed][ef]C[Jon:  Now the fight looks more reasonable for black.  By making the 1-2 exchange, black's stones will be able to move into the center more easily, but they'll also be able to put more pressure on the white pincer stone at A.]
))
(;W[cn]LB[nc:A][iq:B]C[Jon:  The approaches to the bottom left and top right corners are the most attractive moves at the moment. I like both, but the bottom left corner feels more urgent to me, due to black having a second stone in the area at B.  That second stone will allow black to develop the bottom left more quickly than the top right, which doesn't have any extra stones nearby.]
))
(;B[lq]C[(Trying to save the N-3 stone directly)

Jon:  If black pulls out at M-3:];W[jq]TR[lq][mq]C[Jon:  I'd be afraid of white trying to pincer the two marked black stones.  It's just too much trouble for black.]
))
(;B[qr];W[qp];B[qj]C[Jon:  Once black makes this extension, he's settled both of his groups in this area, but white's group isn't doing anything useful.  This is why I strongly prefer this result for black.

On a side note, this is the end result of another joseki, but the position was created with a different order.  I've made a reference to that joseki in the second variation.]
)
(;AE[cd][pd][qm][on][po][dp][mq][qq]C[Jon:  Here is the original order of the joseki mentioned.]
PL[W];W[po];B[qm];W[qq]LB[on:1][mq:2]C[Jon:  White attaches in the corner first and saves the 1-2 exchange for later.  Omitting that exchange prevents black from strengthening the corner prematurely (i.e. extending out to 2 when white makes the kosumi at 1).]
;B[qr];W[qp];B[mq];W[on];B[qj]))
(;W[pl]C[Jon:  Pressing down on black's pincer stone is a good choice.  White feels much happier, there's no unnecessary stones weighing his group down.]
