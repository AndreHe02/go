(;B[eb]C[a little crude now you aren't very light and filled one of your own points d16 should be fine for punishment.]

(;W[fd]
(;B[bd]C[Should I play C15 ?

C15 is already on the board not sure how you can play it. 

This move at b16 helps white get base at f18]
(;W[be]
(;B[ck]C[Don't play directly into thickeness you will get burned. Instead play away weakining it slowly.]

(;W[ci]C[This gives him easy running shape.]

good.];W[bp]

probably.];B[fr]C[ This invasion ( F2 ) of black is too early ?
Its fine as long as you read it out. :) but if you have to ask then no its not fine. If you can't read it why are you playing it?]

I wouldn't call it skill you force yourself into these shapes take some more time thinking out your moves and it will come.]

(;W[hc]C[Black is really low in 3 and  2 line in the upper . White has two corner , so that White is leading in the scores in the game .
Also , the thickness of white(left side ) is really well .]

(;B[go];W[hm]C[My review will end here. 
My general comments for improvement are.
Do End game problems you do not seem to understand how to get points from using your stones correctly. 
My second word of advice is do no play by thickness play away from it.
Third is try to read a little longer in the fuseki you could have done a lot better with some of the exchanges.]
