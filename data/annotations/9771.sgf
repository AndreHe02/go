This move is not severe - white group at top is alive and as such does not have to resond to L15.

In this situation, white does not have any weak group whereas black group of stones H4, J4 and L3 are not yet alive. It is urgent to reinforce there first.\]]

yoonyul: good game
Blootooth: i was trying my hardest thx
yoonyul: sure
yoonyul: u are good tho
yoonyul: for a 20k
yoonyul: :)
Blootooth: i think i had the right idea but once i lost the p8 group it was over
yoonyul: yea
yoonyul: it was tense there
Blootooth: there was one move specifically
Blootooth: let me find it
Blootooth: i noticed it the moment after
Blootooth: i cant seem it find it
yoonyul: lol
yoonyul: haha
Blootooth: but it was around when
Blootooth: i had the chance to connect my n12 group with p8 group
Blootooth: thats what i wanted to do and then i got sidetracked
yoonyul: yea ... overall a good game tho
yoonyul: :D
Blootooth: ok see ya ty
yoonyul: ok
yoonyul: bye!


[DrK: I think you can improve a great deal by practicing Tsumego - for reading order of moves - and to try to keep your stones connected. Notice how white kee on splitting your stones.

Try to take care of your own weakness first before attacking - otherwise you expose yourself to counter attack.

I agree that you have the right ideas - just have to learn more
