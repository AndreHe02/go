j: Hi Sebastian, this is jaime and I'll review the game. I'll prepend my comments with "j:"

Some comments after seeing the whole game: you had the upper hand for a long time, but you made several mistakes:

a) you tried to save *every* group - many times it is best to leave them to die and go for the bigger points

b) you were too eager to kill him - remember, this game is of building territory, not necessarily killing, you made too many double cuts

c) and finally, you gave him a few sente moves by answering unneeded moves. This is very hard to manage, but before each stone is placed  one should pay a look at the whole board, specially for moves involving small groups. Very often saving one or two stones implies losing a lot of points.

I believe if you play a bit more relaxed you'll improve very much.

Good luck!];B[pc];W[dq];B[dc];W[qp];B[jd];W[qj];B[di];W[jp]
;B[jk]C[j: at this point I'd rather play d5, most probably, it seems a bit too early for the middle]
;W[lk];B[ji];W[pe];B[ll]C[j: again, D5 seems better. You don't need to reduce him - yet, you can grow bigger]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[kl];B[kk]C[j: it's set for fight :-)];W[km];B[ln]
;W[lm];B[mm];W[kn];B[ko]C[j: again, this seems too aggresive to me, too many cutting points left behind. Why not M5 (the ladder favours you) or O6 aiming at the right side?]
;W[lo];B[mn];W[lp];B[jo];W[jn];B[io];W[in];B[kp];W[ip];B[ho]
;W[hn];B[hp];W[hq];B[gq];W[kq];B[iq];W[jq];B[hr]C[j: well, you both are split now with two big groups to worry about...]
;W[ir]C[j: this is small and gote... something around O3 would be nice for W to be calm and start pressing N7]
;B[hq];W[jr];B[is];W[lq]C[j: m2 better];B[gn];W[hm];B[hl]C[j: g6 was ok, but now I'd rather go to D5... making his corner small and stablishing a base at the left]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[fn];B[go];W[fl];B[em];W[gl];B[eo]C[j: good!]
;W[hk];B[il]C[j: again, I'd tenuki here, you're in a wonderful position to go for the lower left  corner or else to care about your N7 group. O9, then O4, the all the way to the right seems nice]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[jj];B[kj];W[ij];B[ki];W[ii];B[gk];W[el];B[ih]
C[j: nope! now e6 or d6 will keep your lower left side nicely...]
;W[en];B[dm];W[nc]C[j: wow this is generous indeed :-) if you manage to end with sente you're done]
;B[hi];W[fk];B[hj];W[gj];B[hk]C[j: no, no need to defend, a ko at most, better g11 or f11]
;W[ej];B[dk]C[j: very nice!];W[dl];B[cl];W[cm];B[dn];W[cn];B[fo]
;W[ck];B[bl];W[bk];B[dj]C[j: why not c5? better future, killing that w group will prove very difficult, and with c5 you can either take the c7 group or the corner (or both!)]
;W[bm];B[gi];W[fj]C[j: bad for W];B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[co]C[j: well, he's safe now, and the corner looks very white :-(]
;B[do];W[cp];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ep];B[fq];W[dp];B[dr];W[cr]
;B[es];W[js];B[hs]C[j: no, please do not auto-answer, there's no need to defend there, and you lose valuable sente, your group is already alive..]
;W[cs];B[ds]C[j: again, the same... go for r16 or o9 / o4 / right side!!]
;W[fp];B[gp]C[j: this one is absolutely useless... please relax and think twice before placing the stone]
;W[cj];B[ci];W[ld];B[nk]C[j: good, you saw it!];W[mj];B[mi]
C[j: hmmm I think you missed the point. M4 is still a bit weak, press there and then jump to the right]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[ni];B[bj];W[al];B[aj];W[ak];B[bi]C[j: I hope you can see this sequence has been very bad for you]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[pj];B[oi];W[oh];B[rf];W[pi];B[mp]C[j: good again, but better from O4, not touching the enemy]
;W[mo];B[no];W[np];B[mq];W[nn];B[ol];W[oo];B[pk];W[oj];B[on]
;W[pn];B[om];W[pm];B[pl];W[qk];B[ql];W[qm];B[rl];W[rm];B[po]
;W[pp];B[qo]C[j: but that group is doomed already, you can't save it]
;W[ro];B[sj];W[ri];B[si];W[rj]C[j: bad for w, not needed];B[sk]
