C[
DRS: I am YerbaMate.  I have added comments through this file.  I see no major mistakes in my game, and yet I still wound up 17.5 points behind at the end.  Any suggestions on better moves much appreciated.]
;B[po];W[dd];B[ep];W[pd];B[co]LB[pq:A][qf:B][cf:C]C[DRS: Is this "shimari" at all reasonable?

Comment: This move is not a standard opening
play at A, B, or C is more usual];W[pq];B[np]LB[pf:A][qf:A]
[pg:A][qg:A][oq:B]C[Comment: This joseki usually plays when there's a stone at A
In this situation, the joseki at B would be better];W[op];B[oo]
;W[nq];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq];B[jp];W[iq]LB[ho:A]
C[DRS: Should I have played hane instead of just climbing along on the fourth line?

Comment: play hane is good, because play A now doesn't seem too big to me]
;B[pi]LB[pf:A][pg:B]C[Comment: This move is a  passive move
Black has to use the thickness at bottom as efficient as possible now
playing at A or B would be better];W[ip];B[io];W[ho];B[in];W[hn]
;B[im];W[eq];B[dq];W[fq];B[dr];W[fp];B[eo];W[oj];B[pj];W[oi]
;B[ok]LB[oh:A]C[Comment: P9 is another passive move
Since black has a wall at bottom
Black should be thinking about how to attack white
Playing at A would be better];W[mj];B[nk];W[li];B[oh];W[ll]
;B[jc];W[qf];B[qh];W[lc];B[fc];W[id]LB[cf:A][hc:B]C[DRS: Seems like a bad move.

Comment: J16 is a unreasonalbe move
There's no reason for white to play there
The only 2 possible places are A and B
but since white has a weak group at center
playing at A would be safer];B[ic];W[hd];B[hc];W[fd];B[eb]LB[ec:A]
C[Comment: This move is unreasonable also
A seems like the only choice to me];W[ec]C[Comment: White played at E17 immediately]
;B[gd]LB[dc:A][gc:B][ed:C][fb:D]C[Comment: Black can consider to atari at A
The sequences would be B,C,D];W[fb];B[gc];W[db];B[fe];W[ed]
;B[he];W[ie];B[gb];W[hf];B[ge];W[ke];B[fa];W[dg]LB[cc:A][dc:B]
[cb:C][da:D][be:E]C[Comment: Black can play at A as sente
If white plays at B
then Black can live easily];B[qc]LB[ci:A]C[Comment: A is the biggest place]
;W[pc];B[rd]C[DRS: Standard move?  Should result in a ko?

Comment: Yes,this is a standard move, and it will result as a ko]
;W[re];B[pb];W[ob]C[DRS: I read here a long time, eventually deciding that W was thin enough on the outside that I could try to live inside or cut and fight - but I now think this was a mistake.]
;B[qb]LB[rb:A]C[DRS: So I think this probably should've been A, S18, to make a ko.  True?

Comment: Yes, because black has many ko threats];W[qd]C[DRS: But W decided to solidify the outside before trying to kill, apparently.]
;B[sc]LB[ra:A][rb:B][se:C][sd:D][sb:E]C[Comment: Even at this move, white can still play it as a ko
see sequences A - E];W[se]C[Comment: White lost the chance of making a ko]
;B[ra];W[pa];B[sb];W[qp]C[Comment: This move is very big];B[qo]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[so];B[sn];W[sp];B[rn];W[kn];B[ko];W[mn];B[nn]
;W[nm];B[om];W[ck]C[DRS: This seems huge.  I wanted that point!]
;B[ci];W[bg];B[ei];W[cm];B[el]LB[bh:A]C[Comment: Black can consider to make the exchange at A first]
;W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[fj];W[em];B[fm];W[ek];B[fk];W[dl];B[fl]
;W[cj];B[en];W[dm]LB[cf:A]C[Comment Black can play A as sente first]
;B[da];W[fi];B[cb]LB[fh:A][gi:B][eg:C]C[DRS: Good trade?

The trade was o.k. However, Black may consider to play as the sequences from A - C and attack white
Even black doesn't play C18, white will not get many territories at the corner anyways]

C[Comment: B16 is unnecessary,];W[bn];B[bo];W[er];B[if];W[jf]

;W[rg];B[rh];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[ri]LB[sj:A][rj:B][sk:C][rl:D]
[sl:E]C[Comment: This move can be consider as the losing move
there's no need for this move
If white atari, then black can play A
Especially, black lost the sente for playing ending game moves]
;W[pg];B[ph];W[ld]C[Comment: This place is huge
Currently, Black is losing about 20 points];B[og]C[Comment: Black should play at A
If white plays at P13];W[of];B[ng]LB[lg:A]C[Comment: Black should play at A to attack white]
;W[nf];B[gj];W[eg];B[ff]LB[kj:A][lg:B]C[Comment: If Black plays at A, forcing white to connect
then plays at B, white is nearly dead already
This is the last chance for black to win the game];W[jl];B[il]

C[DRS: I believe this was a bad move.

Comment: This move is only 2 points, but there's no way for black to win the game now]

;W[oc];B[ni];W[ki];B[lo];W[qr];B[gf];C[The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 73 territory + 4 captures + 0.5 komi = 77.5
   Black = 56 territory + 4 captures = 60
White wins by 17.5.

Comment: Black needs to work hard on the opening and tesuji, and always try to get sente before playing the ending game moves
