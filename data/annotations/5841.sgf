AB[pd][dp][pp]C[[Y\] Hi, I lost badly to this 2d guy in this game.  Can you give me some pointers so that I can beat him next time?  Thanks!]

;W[cb];B[ec];W[cf];B[fd];W[fb]C[[Y\] After my f16, he still went for f18.  Is this a trick play?

--
Yes a funny kind of trick play,
 but it's bad for white if black don't answer 
because is just a very small yose gote move if you play G16 for example.
E19 becomes gote for him (so he can't play it and has no continuation).]

(;B[gc]LB[gc:A][fe:B]C[[Y\] I decided to capture these two stones.  It was not a good idea.  His trick play worked :-(.]

;W[bb]
(;B[hh]C[[Y\] Now I have only one eye.  I have to run.  What's the best to run?  Simply a jump to F11 would be better?  I ended up in a very bad shape and have no control of the game after that.
--

This is not the proper move to run away because White will use cutting points to built up territories.
If you play F11 White will be happy to continue to build territory on left side.
So may be just play G13 to play tenuki (see variation)];W[fi]
;B[gg];W[hf];B[jh];W[jf];B[mc];W[kh];B[hj];W[cn]C[[Y\] I decided to attach.  Maybe I can get something from attacking.]
;B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[je]
(;B[jc]C[[Y\] Tried to kill, but it was over-reaching.  Bad idea.

---

It's far better to take sente to keep white under pressure to built large moyo on right side (see variation)]

(;B[mh]LB[kb:B][mh:A]C[[Y\] I thought my bottom group wouldn't die.  I should've played L18...

Yes L18 seems good (white is not alive)];W[lb];B[rb];W[rc];B[qb]

;B[kb];W[jb];B[pa];W[ra]C[Game over

--

So to win next time :
1. don't fall into white traps (don't play in contact: white is always better in fights) ;
2. keep global plays in mind (to take advantage of handicap stones);
3. try to keep sente to play big points first.
