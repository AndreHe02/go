AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hi and thank you for reviewing this game!
I added some comments/variations where I have questions or I have spottet mistakes myself.

GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, though White here is likely to make plays way over my head :)

I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf];W[cn]
;B[fp];W[dg]
(;B[dm]LB[fc:B][dm:A]C[GP: This is a contact play, you are likely to strengthen White here and still end up wanting to respond. If you are that worried about F10, it is a reasonable play yourself, though I would prefer a move in the top right corner.]
;W[dn];B[em];W[cp];B[dq]C[GP: Don't be frightened! You'll have points whittled away if you pull back unnecessarily. C3 is fine here, if wD3 bE3 wD2 bC2 - F4 makes sure the cut cannot work. If in doubt, don't fall back into passivity, it's a guaranteed way of losing a game unnecessarily. If you can't read something devastating yourself, risk it :)]
;W[cq];B[cf]C[GP: Again, you'll make White stronger. Attack globally with a move such as F16 - now that D10 has been fortified a move such as F16 can threaten to swallow up D13 without needing to come near it.]
;W[nq]
(;B[pq]LB[pq:A][pr:B]C[GP: This is a definite mistake (see comments on variations)]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[oo]C[GP: This outwards strength that White is building up, sealing Black in, is painful]

(;B[no]LB[no:A][np:B]TR[oo][nq]C[Not sure about this move, I think I was just trying something new :)
And, it was some sort of misclick (but in my head xD), because if I remember correctly, I wanted to cut the marked stones.

GP: Yes, the exchange up to 19 hugely strengthens White's local position. Why do this at all. Settle the corner and tenuki is at least as valuable (S6 perhaps?)]
;W[op];B[np];W[oq];B[mq];W[po];B[rp];W[ro]
(;B[rr]LB[qp:B][rr:A]C[what's the most elegant way to live here?

GP: R4 is the only move. Remember, White's not playing to kill, just get outside influence. Giving him a ponnuki here made him much much more solid.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[nc];B[qf];W[dc];B[ed]C[GP: Again, I think you really want a hane here. Either E17 or C17 is fine, but you are being too passive. Letting White settle so easily on the top gives White much more opportunity to attack more severely, especially when White can play to attack these three White stones if he can get the initiative to do so.]
;W[ec];B[gd];W[fd];B[fc];W[fe];B[cc]C[GP: This is kind of overplayish, but the fighting spirit is excellent. Good choices of hanes as well.]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[fb];B[gc];W[gb];B[cg]C[GP: Good settling move, and builds some points. The aji at the top is still very nasty though.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[hc];B[hd];W[ie];B[hb];W[he]
(;B[lc]C[GP: Nice idea :) I'd prefer L17 probably. The pressure on O17 is still high, and it enables you to take L14 which will give you globally a much better position.]
;W[ge];B[hc];W[bb];B[dh];W[kd]C[GP: And L17 would have avoided this rather unpleasant clamp.]
;B[kc];W[je]
(;B[ld]C[GP: Connect and live, this is not a nice ko to fight. White gets two _big_ free moves in the top right.]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[ha];B[jd];W[pc];B[ke];W[qd];B[od]C[GP: This is a thank you move - you strengthen White here for no gain. Better to tenuki. M4, R8 to strengthen, K13 to attack - Even R16 is better locally (if wQ15 bS16 is a nice result. If wS16, bP16 becomes move valuable).]

(;B[cr]C[GP: If you aren't going to defend the hane, play D2 instead, otherwise C7 is wasted.]
;W[br];B[cm];W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[bn];W[bo];B[bm];W[sp];B[or]
;W[nr];B[ps];W[rq];B[fh]C[GP: Following at O1 is big! At least that settles the N3 group for sure.]
;W[fg];B[fi]C[GP: Too many gote sequences. If you were going to defend this, you shouldn't play F12. You really want to avoid attacking in gote.]
;W[ns];B[os];W[sr];B[rs];W[nm];B[km];W[gh];B[kh];W[kg];B[lg]
;W[ki];B[lh]C[GP: Be careful of leaving N3 unsettled! At the very least take L2 if you can to secure at least one eye.]

Or am I missing something? so If i'm right, the very last ko is worth one point, so battling it out in a ko fight can sometimes even have some sense, right?

GP: Yes, that would be the hope. He who has more ko threats wins a point in this exchange. However, _any_ ko threat worth a point or more needs to be responded to, so it can take a long time, and if White knows he's ahead by enough he won't bother.]

Thanks again for the review!


GP: I've not really reviewed the latter yose much as the game's key points were all much earlier on. Some real areas to focus on:

1) Don't fall into passivity. There's no reason to back right off unless you can read a solid guaranteed reason to do so, where the "back off move" is objectively more valuable in terms of points. Always look to play the proper response shapewise.

2) Settling because your group's about to die and you need it to live makes a lot of sense obviously. However, equally valuable is settling before attacking. Playing "killing/eye-removing" moves before making them work (see C2 and O18 for example) is like playing out a broken ladder, it's points thrown away. Make threatening outside moves that gain 1 or two points knowing the followup if your opponent tenukis is so severe is a much more profitable strategy. Always make sure the group you are attacking is weaker than your groups around it. Look at White's earlier play (for example 9: C3 and 53: B18) and watch how White makes sure that any big-ish groups are fully settled and alive before continuing to attack. If you don't have weak groups, it's very hard to attack you.

3) In a handicap game, the goal is to prevent White from getting strong. The bottom right is a classic example of what Black mustn't do. Letting White get outside thickness down there allowed White to fight very strongly in that area for the latter half of the game. The big life and death of that group and the lower invasion were resting on the strength White gained. Sure, stepping back to R6 would have allowed White to take the corner, but then Black gets the thickness facing all over the board (because of the handicap stones) and can fight much more strongly. An easily settled group with good thickness is normally better then living small in the corner.

I hope that helps in some way, I've tried to answer your questions in the game and post a number of comments and variations that may be useful. Please do send any comments and questions you have my way, and don't forget to rate the review (positively or negatively) when it goes onto the ladder :)

E8 is a perfectly reasonable follow up here. Remember White is the one with the weak position, so keep the three stones from completely settling and White still has a harder job.]
