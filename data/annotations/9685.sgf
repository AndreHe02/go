C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS.

I'll start my comments with W:];B[oc]C[F: I wanted to make the game more interesting.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[dp]
(;B[qn]
(;W[ql]LB[jp:A]C[Was this pincer good? Comments on the followup responses?

W: Normally you pincer if you have an extension on the side, around A. Your aim then would be to close Black in the corner, while building a framework at the bottom.]
;B[nq];W[pn];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[op];B[oq]C[W: I thought the joseki ends here?]
;W[mo]TR[lp]C[Triangle is joseki. N5 seems too slow because of the thickness?]

(;B[fq]C[F: Was this optimal? I was thinking of enclosing at R16 or playing at C6 but I wanted to be able to attack white's corner if white plays at M3 later on.]

(;W[cn];B[iq]C[Thought about K3 but thought that the cutting point at H3 would be too severe.

W: Black's position at the bottom is flat, it is hard for Black to develop.]

(;W[qd]C[Right approach? Comments on the followup moves?

W: White does not need to play this low and defensively, when he has such a strong position in the bottom right.]
;B[pe]
(;W[qe];B[pf];W[qg];B[jc]C[W: White was pressed into a low position, not making use of his strong position in the bottom right.]
;W[fc]LB[cf:A][pg:B]C[Comments on this as well?

W: White is starting a 1 on 3 battle in Black's strong area if you want to approach, approach from the weak side at A.

The correct move in this position is B. B increases White's moyo, and decreases Black's moyo at the same time. If Black were to play here, Black would increase his moyo and reduce White's moyo.]
;B[ec]C[Thought about F16, C14 but decided kick was the best out of the 3 because I can use my K17 stone to pressure the white stone.]

(;W[cc]C[Better than F16?]
(;B[cd];W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[fd];W[gc];B[gd];W[bc];B[cj]C[Comments please?

W: It's a good move.];W[ch]
(;B[dg]
(;W[cg];B[dh]C[W: Giving Black what he wants.];W[be];B[bf]C[F: Misread this]

(;B[od];W[pb]
(;B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[qj]LB[qd:A][pn:B]C[Right invasion?

W: What do you want to accomplish with this invasion? The groups marked with A and B are 100%+ alive. If your invasion does not create attackable groups, the invasion will only hurt you since you create a weak group you can not sacrifice.]
;W[kp]C[F: I felt this move was too soft and slow.

W: What is the purpose of this move in the end? Both Black groups at the bottom are 100%+ alive. This move does not threaten Black, and it does not increase White's moyo or give White points. You could even say White passed or played on a dame point (a point of no value).]
;B[kq];W[lq]
(;B[jp];W[kr];B[jq];W[ko]
(;B[qm]C[Better way to make sure of the R6 stone?];W[pl];B[pm]
;W[om];B[on]C[W: Like checking the king in chess, putting a stone in atari for no purpose is a sign of a weak player. In most cases giving atari without capturing only helps your opponent, as it does here.]
;W[ol];B[rp];W[ro];B[np];W[no]
(;B[oo];W[nn]
(;B[rn]C[Black mistake.];W[po];B[qo];W[rm];B[so];W[pg]C[W: This is an opening/middle game move. It means it is far larger than the endgame moves that have been played already.]
;B[og];W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[qf];W[rf];B[ni];W[nj]
;B[mi];W[jj]C[[Note\] Review up to this point...rest of the game was just a big mess.

W: As you wish.

Hope you enjoyed even if it was a very short review!

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to send me an e-mail.]
