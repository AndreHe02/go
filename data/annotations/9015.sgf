C[Reviewed by NM {"ProboViro" on kgs - 2k) for White];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[ce];W[jc];B[hc];W[nc]C[GG: I was expecting B:M17 here, but this seems even better for me.]
;B[oc];W[nd]C[NM: Looks good for W so far,];B[qf];W[cj];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[nq]C[GG: was not sure about the next move

NM: Your answer is good.];W[jq];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[oq];B[np]
;W[qn];B[lq]C[GG: Black group seems weak, but how do I attack it?

NM: You just keep making its life difficult while reinforcing youself, for example K5 or L5.]
;W[kp]C[NM: That's OK too];B[lp];W[kn];B[op];W[pq];B[nr];W[or]
C[NM: This gains you litte, and is only worthwhile if you have a really strong attack. I would play P5, M5, or R10.]
;B[hr];W[jr];B[mn];W[je]C[GG: I played this because I wanted to strengthen my group a little before invading at R17, but it didn't work out as I was hoping.

NM: It's a useful strengthening, but I would go on with the lower side attack, e.g. with B2 or H5.]
;B[he]C[NM: Now you have to accept that B has strengthened himself and gained points - more than you did.]
;W[qc];B[ob];W[re]C[GG: I think I should have played S16 here, or is trying to live here hopeless?

NM: No. See the variation.];B[rf]
(;W[nb];B[qe];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[qb]C[NM: This way you strengthen yourself in sente, but it's a missed opportunity.]
;W[od];B[pc];W[qk]C[NM: That's OK, but I would go one space more. While B's O3 group is weak, it's dangerous for him to invade.]
;B[ch]C[NM: His upper left is getting big - maybe now is the moment for a reducing move like F14.]
;W[ej];B[eh]C[GG: at this point I was scared by blacks upper left and started trying all kinds of silly things. What was the proper thing to do?

NM: Tricky to invade, though it may be possible - what about G13? If he makes the safe answer of F14, that's a useful reduction in sente.]
;W[fc]C[NM: Looks pretty hopeless to me - see variation];B[gd]
(;W[db];B[cb];W[cc];B[cd];W[bc];B[eb];W[ec];B[dd];W[fb];B[da]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[ic];B[gb];W[jb]C[NM: well you gained something from the invasion, but not much - and he's that much stronger.]
;B[ha];W[bi];B[bh];W[fg]C[NM: I like that better!];B[fh];W[hg]
;B[gg];W[gf];B[gh];W[hf];B[ie]
(;W[jg]C[NM: I think you can block at J14 - see variation.]
;B[if];W[ig];B[jf]C[GG: Should have simply extended here to L15 here, I think.

NM; Yes, I think so.];W[le];B[ke];W[kd];B[kf];W[ij];B[oe];W[ne]
;B[of];W[gj]C[NM: That's still a reasonable result for W.];B[br]

;W[pm];B[on];W[om];B[nm];W[ah];B[ag];W[ai];B[bf];W[lh];B[oj]
;W[ll]C[NM:  W has 10 points top centre, 24 bottom right, and a claim, if all goes well, on 48 in left centre. B has 35 in top left, 8 in bottom left, 7 in bottom right, and 25 in top right. It seems to me W is a few points ahead.]

;B[ki];W[kj]C[NM: Should be simply L13.];B[li];W[lg];B[lj];W[kk]
;B[lf];W[lc]C[NM: Should be N15, though W has still lost some points in this sequence.]
;B[me];W[ld];B[kg];W[mf];B[mg];W[nf];B[ng];W[iq];B[hq];W[ml]
C[NM: Seems pointless to me, I would prefer F15, E15, then R11]
;B[nk]C[NM: Now B is slightly ahead, unless W can do something clever.]
