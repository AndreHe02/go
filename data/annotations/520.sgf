;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[jd];W[cf];B[di];W[fc]C[Possible, but can drive to
difficult fight for white.];B[cc]C[Certainly strong resistance.]
;W[jb]C[Interesting];B[jc]C[Not bad]
;W[ib];B[hc]LB[kb:b]
C[The normal move is at "b" but 13 is not bad]
;W[lc]LB[hb:a]C[Intersting Idea but the next black move is
strong. I think I will have push at "a" instead.];B[hb]
C[Good as White cannot cut!];W[ef];B[de]LB[dg:b][fd:c]
C[My feeling is this kikashi is bad
as Black would like to play yhe other one at "b". Play at "c" directly.]
;W[df];B[fd];W[dk]LB[gg:b]
C[May be a little too much. Playing at "b" is quiet but 20 is not bad.]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[cj];W[dm];B[fi]C[Good. The beginning of the game is good for Black.]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[fh]LB[gg:b]C[Too heavy. After the nozoki of 26 , play in keima at
"b" is the shape.];B[hi]LB[gh:b]C[Hane at b seems possible and more severe.]
;W[fe]C[It looks a litle aji keshi but OK.]
;B[gd];W[hg];B[gh]LB[ih:b][jh:c]C[Bad move as you strengthen White.
Attack with kosumi or keima];W[gg];B[dh]C[First really very
bad move as you cannot cut white after it.];W[dg]LB[jg:b]C[Answering is
worse ; you should jump at b for example];B[gf]C[It may look as a eye stealing tesuji but it is not so good. Still play
keima to suuround White is enough.];W[ff];B[hf]C[You see now that 37 is almost gote and helps white to flee.];W[hh]
;B[gi];W[jh];B[ep]LB[nc:b]C[Better at b as you can attack 3 stones severely];W[oc]LB[nc:b]C[Usual at b but not so
bad];B[co]LB[pc:b]C[No. Answer first in the other corner at "b" is big.];W[dp]LB[do:a]C[Not so good. I think I will simply cut at "a"];B[do];W[eo];B[en];W[fo];B[dn]C[Black is happy to connect at 51 and the
3 white stones are not in good health.];W[eq];B[fn];W[go];B[bp]LB[fl:a][hm:b]C[No. Just capture with "a" or "b"];W[fl];B[gn];W[hl];B[ih]LB[ho:b][el:c]C[You should play hane at b as this is
almost sente. You must not worry for your group as you have some
possible connection underneath beginning with];W[ig];B[ii];W[jf];B[in]

situation is difficult.];B[hk];W[bk];B[bj];W[bm];B[dl]LB[cn:b][bn:c]C[This helps White. Play at b or c to kill eyes];W[em]LB[bn:B]C[B is also a ko but a better one for
black];B[ak];W[al];B[bl];W[hj];B[ik];W[bk];B[kg]LB[aj:b]C[Connect once seems OK at "b" ; still ko];W[kf];B[bl];W[ij];B[jj];W[bk];B[fg];W[eg];B[bl];W[gj];B[cm]C[No. You should answer the ko
threat.];W[jk];B[lh]C[May be better to leave this
stone and play in the corner but it is true that White is not alive.]
;W[jg];B[lg];W[lf];B[ld]C[Very good.];W[mc]C[White
should hane and sacrifice the 2 tones if necessary];B[md];W[nf];B[nd]LB[od:b]C[I would play at b but 107 is also
good.];W[mg];B[mh];W[nh];B[me];W[mf];B[nc];W[nb];B[ob]LB[pc:b]C[This sacrifice strategy is weak. b is
good];W[pb];B[pc]C[Especially if you want to
play it after.];W[oa];B[od]LB[kc:b]C[Test at b first. If white
answer, play at a. But white will go in the corner. So 19 is not so
bad.];W[qb];B[kc];W[kb];B[pg];W[ni];B[lj]C[The good shape is at 126 because 126 is
forcing you to connect.];W[mj];B[li];W[lk]LB[qi:b]C[Thick but conservative. Why not "b"];B[op];W[mq];B[io];W[ip];B[hp]LB[jp:b]
C[Bad move. Simply hane at "b"];W[hq];B[gp];W[fp];B[iq]C[White can resist, but it seems dangerous.]

heavy. What about "b".];W[mo]C[Good
move.];B[lp];W[mp];B[qq];W[pq];B[pp];W[oq];B[qo];W[rp];B[ro]LB[qm:b]C[Playing at "b" seems wise];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[og];W[ng];B[qk];W[pj]LB[qi:b]C[White should go deeper at "b"]

Connecting at 73 is not big. A little more than 6 points. For example b
is more than 10 points.];W[ol];B[cq];W[pl];B[dq]LB[ql:a]
C[Terrible mistake. 77 is not sente.
Black must answer at "a"];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm];B[sl]LB[rj:a]C[Playing at "a" seems to let black live];W[rj]LB[qm:a]C[Simply connect at "a"]

 If white plays at the vital point, black seems to be dead.]

7 stones and was lucky to live with 2 eyes on East side.]
