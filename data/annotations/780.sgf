C[I have been told by pros and amateurs that my weakest area is
middle-game fighting - so comments about that topic would be most
appreciated.David,I can't say from one game what your weakest area is. I
suspect that blaming mid-game fighting is not a helpful view in terms of
improving your game.The main problem I see in this game is the lack of
consistency in your moves. You seem to be reacting rather than building. If
you always react to your opponent you are always one step behind, which is a
losing strategy. That is why initiative (and/or sente) are so
important.Probably the mid-game fighting is where lack of consistency can
lose a game in one move. That is why you notice it. But the seeds of failure
get planted much earlier. Look at your move 25 in this game for a prime
example.If you are playing for both sides of a fight, you will lose most of
them. Perhaps you have too active an imagination about your opponent's
prospects. This is common when you think your opponent is stronger than you
are. You have much more fun in a game when you cause your opponent to be
worried about YOUR prospects. The way to do that is 1) to be patient (i.e.
don't try to be everywhere on the board) and  2) try use your sente moves
to enlarge rather than
invade.Regards,Brad];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[co];B[jd]C[I almost

C[By invading the corner, you
are setting your previous move up as a target. If you wanted that corner so
badly, you should have gone there the move before. N3 is steady and works
just
fine.]

(;W[jg]C[F7
turns white from attacker to attackee.Your move is a small minded
territorial move. You don't play the sen-ren-sei opening to make moves like
this.It is not that the territorial size of the move is small though. It is
a very big gote
move.]
(;B[jc];W[kf];B[le];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc];W[ln]C[White is closing
the door on the right. Get out on the left.Here is the principle. If your
opponent goes one way, the natural direction for you is the other way. If
you play in the same direction as your opponent, he always gets the best for
himself. The only way to get the best for yourself is to get there
first.]

helping white out. You did not even make your second eye, but white got 15
points.];W[cm];B[ck]C[C9 is small territorially and it is inconsistent with
your weak group at the bottom.];W[pi]C[White's move 70 is a thank you move.
He allows you to fix your cutting point. If you play Q12 his move looks even
more awkward.]
