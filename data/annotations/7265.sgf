Here R7 is played in a too narrow place; K3 ; K4 are bigger,
expanding the top right corner with G17 or H17 putting pressure on white group is also a better place]

;W[oh];B[nh]LB[nh:B][oh:A]C[white should read first the ladder this exchange is good for you!!]
;W[re];B[oe]C[P15 was a failure I think, because it enables p16 - q17 - o15 - p14 - p17 and the corner is lost. I saw that after q17 and lost the corner in another way then, but my question is:
Would there be a way to save the corner or at least my stones there with something like expanding on p16 instead of playing p15?]
;W[od]
(;B[oi]C[you don't have to take the stones now, the mistake is this move!!  Taking the outside with P15 preventing white to connect his stones is good I think but than capture him!!
S17 is doing the job (see variation) Perhaps R17 works too but more complicated, I'm not that sure]

;B[cm];W[cc]C[that move causes problems for me in many games. Whatever I try to do against c17 after d16 is already mine does not work. My opponents every time manages it to form a living group there.
On the other Hand I have to admit that I can do the same to other opponents too and that's the way I win most of my games where my opponent gets starting stones on the hoshi.
But there needs to be something that can be done against such an attack, right?
I would be pleased to get to know about it^^

Paps:  because you've made white stronger on the outside he can invade the corner threatening to connect with E 18 or live inside. you cannot avoid both but you have a choice
play D17 not E17 if you don't like this invasion but sometimes it's good for you to become stronger on the outside.]

paps: D 3 does the job better but  most important:
DON'T FEAR CORNER INVASION 
it's not a problem to let your opponent live in the corner. The outside influence you'll get is more valuable
in this situation it is better to pincer than to defend the corner]

;W[fn];B[mq];W[kq];B[kr];W[jr];B[lr];W[jq];B[qq]C[the same. I really fear that move

Paps:
1  In this position the invasion is still posible and you allready have outside influence so, letting White live in your corner just destroy your points. In this situation it is good to defend against the invasion 

2 the shape hoshi with 2 large keima (Q4 R7 N3) is not good because the invasion is still possible
usually if you play a keima (knight move) on one side you schould close the other one (Q3 and not N3 for example)]

;W[iq];B[ho]C[Sree [16k\]: thx for the game

Paps: I hope I haven't bored you with too many comments. I've tried to tell you everything I noticed.
once again I'm not a high dan player, perhaps I'm wrong with some statements.


To remember (I'm quite sure with these ideas ! ;))

1 don't fear to be invaded in the corner when you have a stone at the 4X4 point (hoshi) if your opponnent lives inside and you enclose him in the corner: it's usually better for you than for him.

2 in the opening play the largest free areas.

3 don't lose sente playing small moves (E19, T4 D1 for exempple in your game)

4 you can study the L shape (and L+1leg; L+2legs). It's very common and usefull in our games!

see you soon on KGS or in turnaments if you live in europe!
Bye
