C[Thank you for reviewing this game.];B[qd];W[pp];B[dd]C[I'm not very well educated on proper fuseki. Is this acceptable? Even if it is, what are your suggestions?
these opening moves are fine. According to Yilun Yang's opening fundementals ( I highly recommend his "Fundemental Principles of Go" book) both opponents made first class moves 9 occupy an empty corner).]
;W[dp]C[white take the last open corner which is fine.];B[cn]
C[I assume this approach is standard. Should I try F3 or O3 instead? according to Y. Yang, enclosing the 3-4 stone is higher priorty than approaching a 4-4 stone... P16 or P17 for example]
;W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[dj];W[cf];B[ch]LB[fc:C][fd:B]TR[cc]C[black makes a base... be prepared for white to often invade ... at 'A'  or double approach at 'B' or 'C']
;W[cd]C[ black now has the chance to make a big extension on the top around k17 since white did not double approach... something to keep in mind possibly.]
;B[cc]
(;W[bd];B[de];W[df]C[at this point black should stay aware of the possible weakness at D17]
;B[ef]TR[dc][ee]C[cutting points are increasing here ... but black has good idea to try to seal white in while building outside wall of inflence adn power (should be good for fighting later).]
;W[bc]
(;B[dc]LB[cb:A]TR[kc][kd]C[Looking at it now, I feel B19 should have been at A because it gives B sente

the marked points are becoming more important for both white and black ... black is building a large wall on upper left ... upper right has not been enclosed. It is also very big move for white to approach 3-4 point as soon as things settle down with the  weak white group in upper left.]
;W[cb];B[db]LB[fd:1][gd:2][hd:3][id:4][jd:5][kd:6][ld:7][md:8]
[nd:9][od:10][pd:11]C[good to seal white in ... may also want to tenuki and play in bigger open area ( see how tall and wide the open area is on teh top? )]
;W[dg]TR[cf][df]C[empty triangle ... bad shape to punish ... just tenuki and take sente is good enough.]

(;B[eg]C[Black contacted a weak stone/group. Try not to contact a weak stone... when white extends, white gets stronger. If possible, try to make moves that make you stronger, opponent weaker.]
;W[dh]SQ[ch]C[white is stronger and marked black stone at C12 is weakened...]
;B[di];W[eh]LB[bb:A]C[Should I not tenuki W26?

I would try to punish the weak white group with no eyes at this point...]

(;B[nq]TR[kc]C[L17 looks bigger to me than approaching the 4-4 stone at Q4.]
;W[oq]C[I notice many players are fond of the kosumi-tsuke]
;B[np]
(;W[pn];B[jq]TR[gr]C[good three space extension with two-stone wall. also leaves good follow-up move towards open lower left corner.]
;W[hq]LB[qq:A]C[white does not want black to follow-up.... so he closes the door.]

(;B[ql];W[qm]C[And again.];B[qq]C[I'm not sure what I was thinking with this move. Clearly too early, but I had opponent-has-too-much-territory-phobia at the time. 

>not too early... I think very sound ... maybe just one move too late. check out kogo's joseki dictionar at eidogo.com for some fun joseki variations.]
;W[qp]
(;B[pq]C[I think that this is not correct. (see some variations)]
;W[or];B[rp];W[ro]
(;B[nr]C[Good to make a base for the black group...];W[rq]C[Thankfully W responded in gote.
I think that the corner is so big for white that I would probably play gote ther too in this postion]
;B[op]
(;W[oo]C[This shocked me. W gives up corner for P5? 
>I agree... white should not give up the corner.];B[pr]C[good to punish white]
;W[sp];B[rl]LB[pl:A]SQ[kc]C[AND I'm able to correct here, albeit in gote. Should it have been at A?

either move looks like it make black heavy... I would play in biggest open area which is the top.]
;W[kp]
(;B[jp]C[contacting a weak stone can make it stronger if white extends... can try a softer attack (j4?)]
;W[no];B[ko];W[lo];B[lp]C[good fighting by black];W[mo];B[mp]
;W[jd]LB[ld:A]SQ[db][dc][dd][de][ef][eg]C[How to answer this high move? 

this is a really big move for white and black ... as mentioned earlier. now is a good time to extend from upper right to drive towards  powerful wall you built.]

(;B[hd]C[I have heard that one should not use walls to make territory, but rather to attack.perhaps I should have approached from the right? yes... it is dual purpose move from the right... attacks the white stone adn strengthens and extends corner 3-4 stone at R16.]
;W[oc]C[>white takes the approach move... when you drive your opponent towards your wall nect time, your opponent will not be able to settle so easily ;)]
;B[pf]TR[mc]C[good ... help right side and look for an invasion target on top to possibly split white.]
;W[oe]
(;B[of]C[Trying to build a moyo to the center. hard to buidl a moyo now that white is establighing base in black's large framework.  I would try to split white instead to make use of the H16 stone ( I don''t know though I am just 4k).]
;W[ld]C[ah... white may have been worried about the split attack as well.]
;B[mf]TR[pn][lo][mo][no][oo]C[good thinking to try to enclose white. it is hard to build moyo on left with big white wall below.]
;W[me]C[slow move... black should somehow take the initiative or profit then.]

(;B[lf]C[I think too slow.]
(;W[ie]
(;B[he]TR[ok][nl][cq]C[more potential on right? mabe even invade lower left corner at C3?]
;W[if];B[hf]TR[bb]C[small compared with righ side and don't forget the weak white group upper right to push around.]
;W[ig]C[white got stronger from exchange. also reduces potential on the right]
;B[ib]LB[ok:B][ol:A]C[Perhaps this is too small. Maybe A or B? it does give you a base so I think the thinking is OK... it also makes white much smaller on top.]
;W[jb]
(;B[ja]
(;W[ka];B[kb]C[This is correct way to punish, right? 
I am worried about the marked group and its territory now though.... I would tend to play something more solid...there are a lot of ko fights in pper right now though.]

(;B[nk]C[Is this too slow?
 i think so.];W[mi]C[Hrrm... a floater

it is a game of give and take... this is common way to reduce territory... this may be a bit deep... think of it as a target :)]

(;B[lg]TR[lf][mf]C[empty triangle];W[kg];B[qh]C[Is this necessary? I was afraid of W making life in here for some reason.

have no fear here... you ahve lots of power in the vicinity... hope for white to jump in rather than fear it... if oppnent does tne just sqeeze from teh outside... it wll be ver difficult for them to make two eyes in that space.]

Generally, look to use the big wall you made in the beginning of the game. I also encourage you to invade and fight some more to practice tesuji and middlegame tactics. 

Most importantly, thank you for letting me review the game. I enjoyed it. I certainly made some mistakes in the revew, being only 4k, but hopefully some of teh comments and variations will be of some use.
