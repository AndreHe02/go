AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[jsha [7k\]: hi, thanks for the game!
katuhiko [2k\]: hi

Hello,
I'll try to review your game, though a handicap game is something special.
There are a lot of moves (most in the beginning),
which are "ok" with the handicap stones.

Anyway I'll try my best.];W[qf];B[nc]C[from my point of view perfect (as it makes kind of sente)
:-))];W[qn];B[ql]LB[qf:B][qn:A]TR[pj][nq]C[as white A is kind of "playable, but near to overplay",
your intension to keep w seperated is good.

I wouldn't have played r8 (so it's surely playable),
but my idea would be:

w A can live in the corner anyway. So better put some pressure on B, so Q10 is perfect.

Another possibity (showing self confidence) is O3, let w play Q10 and have sente]
;W[on];B[np]C[ok];W[qj];B[ol];W[mn];B[lp];W[nj];B[ml];W[kn]
LB[qp:A]C[A: simple (but useful in handicap or when ahead)

1) secures the corner
2) helps against the cuts
3) with S6 b can connect  to R8 (or live)

but very slow!]
(;B[jp]C[At this point I was pretty happy, feeling I had a whole bunch of fourth-line territory.  Of course, as you will see, white cut me up pretty badly.  How should I have modified my chasing tactics to get a better result?

As far as i can see, your result is not so bad.
But there are some other variations that might be more alike.

First of all A (last move)

In the end the reason of your dissapointment is, that Q4 to K4 is not terretory, but more a moyo]
;W[oq]LB[op:A]C[Here A is the keypoint, i would connect, the result is ok for b, but might not be your taste (since it's a bit simular to your result)]
(;B[pq]C[sometimes correct, here questionable];W[op];B[oo];W[no]
;B[po];W[mp];B[nq];W[mq];B[or]C[Should I have gone o2 instead?

no p2 is perfect, because if o2 n2 is still sente];W[pn];B[lq]
;W[mr];B[lo];W[mo];B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[nl];B[nk];W[nm]
(;B[ok]C[I'm pretty sure this was better than n9, but comments would be appreciated.

totally right, n9 instead would be a desaster];W[rl]C[the cuts at s7 or s9 are not possible, see variation]
(;B[qk]C[:-))
good move];W[rk];B[mj];W[cn]LB[cf:F][pj:G][ck:C][dn:A][en:B]
[eo:E][cp:D]C[Here are some moves I would consider:

A: (mediocre) easy way to settle with center profit, but also against the proverb (not making terretory near strength). Also easy for w.

B: (unusual) locally this is a bit of a loss for b, but will give b big moyo in the center; perhaps correct here

C: As b is strong on the lower left side, the corner is not so important. C aims more the whole board bord control, if w plays in the corner, b plays around F and the game will be very hard for w. If w plays at F, b C12 is kind of doulbe attack. So C seems a good idea.

D: Surely not the best move, but a better way to get the kind of profit you aimed with G3. Anyway too slow

E: Same as D, both not so near to the b strength. Anyway too slow

F: quiet move which is also interesting, and aims to play around k16 later (is huge)

G: locally it's sente, and looks like getting complete control of the center, but in the end w answers g11 and says thank you. At least waisting a ko-threat for b]
;B[gq]C[this is the first really serious mistake:

don't make profit near your strength!

In this case even worse, becaus w can (later) k1 so the side is not so big]
;W[fc]C[this tenuki (playing elsewhere) is the logical consequence of G3 (is slow and does nothing else then a few points terretory)]
;B[cf];W[ch]LB[db:A][ck:B]C[A: easy
B: difficult]
(;B[jd]TR[dd]SQ[fc]C[I was proud of this move but it worked out poorly for me.  Should I have gone lower?  Maybe elsewhere?  Protected the lower left corner?

See the formation here:

b is high on both sides, this is not good, because w can easy live (perhaps even in sente) and gets also D9 which is very importent here.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ep];B[fq];W[bp];B[eo]
;W[jb]C[now w use the highness of b stones];B[hc];W[hb];B[gb]
;W[ic];B[gc];W[id];B[fd];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc]C[I think I goofed here, I should have just let white have the corner in exchange for a downward-facing wall, then used the wall to attack the r14 stone.  Is that right?

Normal you are right, if possible playing s15 in exchange to the corner is bigger than saving the corner;

Here it's both not very atractiv, because w strong at the right side, and the extension to the corner is also nothing worth anymore]
;W[rb]LB[qb:A]C[frist A, then tenuki]
(;B[kc]LB[jf:A]C[locally bad to slow; locally A is the form]
;W[je];B[ke];W[jf];B[kf];W[hf]LB[qb:D][pf:A][pg:C][qh:B]C[A: this is the fear of loosing the group, and wastes all invasion possibilities, for this purpose D is the correct move

B: if invading, then directly at B

C: more efficent then A, but no invasion afterwards

D: still first choice

invasion perhaps playable, but not necessary.
I'll try some variations

B seems possible]

;B[he]C[I think this was a bad move- it let white hem me in and made the ko more urgent, when i should have tried to escape or make life so i could take my time in the ko.

Is that what is meant by http://senseis.xmp.net/?Komonster ?

I don't know senseis Komonster, but w ko-threat is not big so you play well, i think]
