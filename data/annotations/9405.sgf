;B[qd]C[Ostara [7k\]: hi g g
Elom [7k\]: Hello, have a nice game!

Hello, I'm Elom, and thank you rfor rewviewing my game. My comments are marked with Elom:

Elom: Most games I play are to do with large groups involed a semai or two, making for quite show.
My opponent would usually under estimate his weakness, make bad shape or just invade too deeply, and because I 'm good at attacking, 75% of the time I'd kill that large group, Leaving me of the hook despite my lack of direction of play and limited joseki knowledge.

But in this game, my opponent doesn't do so, exposing my weak points and only losing due to a decisive error.

Please help point out any errors in my judgement, and any overall mistakes I've just comepletely missed that could be preventing me from reaching 1 dan. Thanks, and sorry for the long introduction!]
;W[nd]C[Elom: I tried experimenting with a move i don't commonly use, but I didn't foresee black's next play.]
;B[pg]C[Elom: I wasn't too sure what to do here];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[pd]
(;B[qe]C[B: this move is too mild];W[oc];B[rc];W[pb]C[Elom: I couldn't help feeling slightly strange here. Have I played a sub-optimal move during this sequence?


B: this result is good for white as white is very strong here. Also black had the first move in this corner,]
;B[qk]LB[rb:A]C[B: next A will be a nice follow up for white]
;W[dp];B[dd];W[pq]LB[qo:A]C[B: I would prefer to play this move at R4. Now black can continue making good shape on the side by playing at A]
;B[jc]LB[fc:A]C[Elom: I wasn't sure about ignoring this stone, however I thought playing in the upper left next to a strong group would just be too slow and concentrated.

B: the white group is very strong so there is no need to protect it. If white wanted to play on the upper side then A is a good start]

(;W[cf]C[B: this is good enough];B[bd]
(;W[ci];B[gc]
(;W[jq];B[po]
(;W[np]TR[jq]C[B: this move is bad when there is a marked stone on K3]
;B[qq]C[Elom: I was worried about playing R2 because i thought it would be what black wants.]

(;W[pp]C[B: this is quite painful for white too to give black points in the corner]
;B[qp];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[om]
(;W[jo]C[Elom: Should I hane at n7 instead?

B: yes. This move is not very big. O7 in sente and then protecting the corner is important.]
;B[mm]LB[nm:A][pm:B]TR[jo]C[B: the marked exchange was good for black though black should have played this move at A to remove the bad aji at B.]

(;W[dq];B[cn]
(;W[en]C[Elom: Okay, this is not one of the best moves i've ever played. Is C5 a good alternative, considering my strength in this area?

B: white is very strong everywhere so letting black to live easily is not good (if black lives easily then white probably loses on points). Pincering at C8 would be good enough.]
;B[ck];W[bo];B[co]
(;W[cp];B[bn]C[Elom: black ends up with a stronger looking group than I'd hoped, weakening my c14 and c11 stones.

B: yes, black is quite happy with this result]
(;W[ln]LB[rb:A][oi:C][qr:B]C[Elom: Is this move too slow? It seemed to give black more territory than me.

B: this move is very slow. Moves like A or B are quite nice. Also reducing at C is good too]
;B[lm];W[kn]
(;B[jl];W[ng]C[Elom: I wasn't comfortable with the  moyo black would make if he played around n14, so decided to make a heroic-looking reduction move. Unfortunately, it would have been more heroic if I was actually sure where to do that.


B: this move is good];B[nh]
(;W[mg]LB[mg:B][nh:A]TR[ng]C[B: this is giving black too much. If white wanted to play the AB exchange after the marked move was played then white should play the B move directly]
;B[mh];W[pm]C[Elom: was this probe neccesary? I was testing weather black would have the nerve to play o7, while creating a little aji. Well, that's whated I tried to do.

B: it creates some aji but I thing white could play this move anytime. There was no big need to hurry]
;B[nm]
(;W[oh]C[Elom: Looking back, this doesn't seem to help.];B[og]
;W[lg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki]
(;W[kg];B[ji]C[Elom: my "reduction" seems to help black. I must have made a mistake somewhere.


B: yes. Black is ahead now so white should start trying some tricks]

(;W[lb]C[B: very small. White made a wall so white must be more agressive here]

(;B[lc];W[mc];B[ld];W[kb];B[jb]
(;W[gf]C[Elom: This move probably needs some explaining, because it seems slightly purposeless. I was trying to lessen the burden of having a weak-ish group on the left of the board by "threatening" to connect my stones. Is it playable at all? Black immediately counters.

B: this move feels a bit like a neutral point. It helps white group a little but it does not have much other effect]
;B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[eg]
(;B[ff];W[ce]C[Elom: Hoping to get some forcing moves on the E14 group.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[ed];W[fg];B[if]C[B: the result here is not very good for black]
;W[bj]C[B: good];B[bk];W[ge]LB[gd:A][he:B][ie:C]C[B: this move is a bit weak. White does not know if he will not prefer A, B or C later. It would be better not to play here at all for now]

(;W[hq];B[ip]
(;W[iq];B[go];W[dj]C[B: this move does not do much];B[cj]
(;W[di]LB[bi:B][bp:A]C[B: now black is alive in sente because AB are miai]
;B[dk]LB[rb:B][qr:A]C[B: bad move. Black is safe so there is no need to play like this anymore. A is very important now and B is also nice.]

(;B[dm]C[B: no need to play this move for black];W[fq];B[ep]
;W[bp];B[eq];W[er];B[do];W[be]LB[rb:B][qr:A]C[B: small. A and B are much bigger]
;B[bh]C[Elom: I think my opponent misread here. I would and should have lost the game if he played b11, despite the upcoming lower right debacle.

B: very painful misread for black];W[bi];B[cg];W[bg];B[ne];W[rb]
;B[sd]LB[me:A]TR[ne]C[B: letting white to have S18 in sente is very bad. Black definitely should tenuki here. Q2 is still important. Also playing around A to finish the idea of the marked stone would make sense too]

;W[fm];B[jh];W[bm];B[al];W[jg];B[tt];W[sa];B[sc];W[tt]C[Elom: In the end, I won by 3.5 points, quite close for a 6kyu (I was promoted after this game).
I was quite lucky to win this game, but above all, this game showcases some of my weak points that I'm trying to Improve, albeit an unusually calm game for me.

Thank you very much for reviewing my game, I'll try to get to 1 dan with the help of this review!

B: 
In this game I view as important the decisions about direction in moves 30 and 34 - the art of building and using white moyo. 
Also later in the game attacking the weak group on the left by connecting on B4 was very important.  

You may want to pay more attention to sente in the middle game and also to huge endgame points like R2 (see the variation at move 63).

Overall you played very solidly in this game. That is great, but the you need to use your strength for attack. Maybe you do that in your other "not so calm" games? 

Good luck with getting to 1d :)];B[tt]TW[pa][qb][pc][af][bf]
