;B[pd]C[Although we had a lot of time, my opponent was playing very fast. It pressured me a lot. That is the main reason for some stupid mistakes you will see. I apologize for my English, its not my native language. Hope you will help me improve. Thx :))

N: Hello, When your opponent plays fast, you shoudn't follow him, see it as an opportunity to outread him.
I think your biggest mistake in this game, was that you played a lot of heavy moves after your invasion. Playing lighter and sacrifice useless stones might be the easiest way to improve for you.
Some of the longer variations which are included, may not be 100% correct, but are mainly to show the different flow which was possible.

N: This is difficult, with the benefit of hindsight, this move seems more like gambling because it leads to a ko. I would prefer using the aji of this cut with an invasion. Many choices possible i think]

N: some questions you can ask yourself:

- Is this ko game deciding? Although big, i wouldn't say the game is over if you win it, making it more risky

- Am i likely to win this ko? You capture first and there doesn't seem to be an absolute threat for white. Imagine the biggest treat for white, and try to evaluate the position after you win the ko and white plays two moves elsewhere.]
