C[Although I lost by quite a bit, besides one major error, I believe I played about as well as I can. I played as black. Thank you for the review!

Dieter Verhofstadt:
 My comments are preceded with (dv)

Main theme of this review is: don't play close to strength. Use strength to attack, not to make territory. Drive enemy stones towards strength. If both are strong in an area, tenuki.

I will label comments in this theme with S1, S2, ...
This is according to me an area for improvement.];B[pd];W[dp]
;B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[qf];B[qi]C[I know this pincher is usually used when P3 is at P4, but I wanted to experiment with it.

dv: I don't think these details really matter at our level, but it is good if you know this and know why (I don't).]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[qe]C[I wasn't sure how to respond to this.]
(;B[pe]C[dv To me this is the only move.];W[qd]
(;B[qg]LB[pc:a]C[My thought with this was to take infulence on the bottom side, but afterwards fell I made white too strong

dv You should cut at A.];W[pc]C[dv: The corner is too big for White.]

;B[de]LB[kd:a]TR[pg][me]C[dv: I'm convinced Black must continue the race to get ahead at A. The cutting points jeopardize the exchange of thickness for territory.]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[dd];B[cd];W[ce]
(;B[cf]C[dv This is a mistake. See the var for the joseki.]
;W[be];B[bf];W[df];B[ee];W[bg];B[db]LB[ec:a]C[dv White can resist.]
;W[bd];B[ec]SQ[bd]TR[eb]C[dv: In comparison with the joseki, WHite gets the squared stone instead of the triangled stone: a big loss for Black.]
;W[bc];B[ed];W[kd];B[lf];W[rg]C[dv This is a small move. White loses the option to cut later.]
;B[qh]C[dv: B becomes stronger];W[ke]
(;B[ic]SQ[de][ee][ed][ec]TR[ke][kd][lc]LB[kf:a]C[dv: Both the marked positions are strong, so 47 is a small move. You must increase your central influence with A.

S1];W[me]
(;B[mf]C[I feel like this was a mistake in the tesuji, as it ends in gote, without being much stronger, unlike the variation.]
;W[le]
(;B[ng]C[dv You should not protect this stone. See var.];W[qn]
C[dv Wrong side.]
(;B[ql]C[dv Wrong side. See var.];W[po];B[op]C[dv GOod technique.]
;W[nn]
(;B[fq];W[iq];B[dn]LB[fo:a]C[dv: I don't like the double approach, for you take the battle closer to White's strength. I prefer a simple jump at A, preparing a splitting attack on white's stones.

(;B[kq]LB[mp:a]C[I tried to separate the right group with this move, but feel that I strengthened white far too much.

dv If you want to separate, use A here.];W[kr];B[lr];W[jq];B[kp]
;W[mr];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[pl]
(;B[pk]C[dv You should fight where you are strong, not yield. See var.

S3];W[ol];B[ok]LB[qm:a]C[dv: reduce base wit A. You are strong in the centre.

S4];W[qm];B[rl];W[nl]C[dv; Now White has settled all his groups, while having more territory. Save heavier mistakes, it is difficult now for him to lose.

;B[gq];W[fn];B[eo]C[Yes, I know. Lost my mind for a moment and was running out of time. I feel there isn't much way to save the game. I count black down by maybe 6 points on the board, but with two weak groups to white's none, and not much potential, that turns to a 20 point difference easily. My yose was probably not great either,  so if you have any comments on that, I would also appreciate it.]
