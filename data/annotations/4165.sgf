C[Hi, I m sylvain (sylvainc on kgs) around 6k. I will precede all my comments by '$'.

$ I was about not to comment this game. U should play against player near ur rank, and as u already have your 3k opponent comments, and didn't ask any question it is not a easy game to comment. I will try my best, 

but it is not possible to estimate ur rank with a game against a much stronger player. The best way to estimate ur rank is kgs ranking after a few games with opponents around ur rank. ur graph on KGS makes u around 16 k.

I will comment only black side, but as I m 6k, comment a 3k side against 16 k is nonsense.]
