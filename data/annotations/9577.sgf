J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments will start with "J:".]
;B[qf];W[dn];B[nq];W[df];B[jc]C[This is not an usual openning for both of us.
Here i want white to approach the 4-3 points or the 4-4 points.

J: White's stones feel over concentrated on the left side.  K17 can be higher at K16 to counterat white's high position.]
;W[pc];B[qc]
(;W[qb]C[J: white can also choose to hane at R16.  See variation.]
;B[qd];W[mc]C[J: White's position is after N17 is thin.  White should instead play at 18.  Black can play P18 himself and damage white's base.  See variation.]

(;B[od]C[Here i'm happy it seems a good result for black, what do you think ?
Maybe i shoud have continued to gain a wall at top ?];W[ob]
C[J: black's move at P16 allows white to fix his P18 weakness.]

(;B[dp]TR[cp][ep][eq]C[J: black can consider E3 or E4 to emphasize the bottom side, working with his O3 stone.  ANother idea is to play C4 looking to disrupt white's left side.  See variations.]
;W[fp]C[Here i think my approach of the corner wasn't good maybe i shoud have approach the 4-3 point ?

J: D4 is playable.];B[eo];W[cq]C[This moves is tough and put me in some trouble after.
What can i do against this move ? whats the best result i can get here ?]
;B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[fo]C[J: F5 is the wrong direction.  Black is pushing against a weak white stone and making him stronger.  White should instead play E6.  See variaion.]
;W[gp]
(;B[jp]C[Maybe the tenuki here is not wise ?

J: K4 is okay, the problem is with F5 originally.];W[go];B[fm]
;W[gn]
(;B[el]TR[dm][em]C[J: E8 is a far extension, but a weak connection.  Black should consider tightly connecting with E7 or leaning on the left side with D7.  See variations.]
;W[dm]
(;B[fn];W[ck]
(;B[gm]C[J: G7 is slow. black can try to seal white with J7.]
;W[in];B[hm];W[ip];B[jo];W[io];B[qp]C[J: maybe too early to tenuki, should keep pressure on white group with K8.]
;W[lp]
(;B[lq]C[Here the game was kinda bad for me.

J: Hard to find a good move here.  One idea is to play K3 to keep white separated.  Another idea is to sacrifice K4 stones to stabilize the H7 group.  See variations.]
;W[kq];B[lo];W[mq];B[lr];W[mp];B[mr];W[kp];B[jq];W[kr]TR[jo]
[jp][jq]C[J: Black is in an awkward position where his three cutting stones are weak.]

(;B[km]C[J: L7 lets black connect, meaning this group locally isn't achieving anything, and is now a liability.  Black can try splitting at K2.]
;W[ir]LB[kq:A]C[Here i think i shoud have thought a way to prevent him to connect because if i can keep pressure this group i can manage to get those groups to live.]
;B[ko];W[np];B[oq];W[op];B[pq];W[jl];B[kl];W[im]LB[fm:A][ko:B]
C[Can you see a way to make this group alive ?
I dont worry about the B group i think it will be ok because it got a good shape.]
;B[di]TR[fi][el][gm][ko]C[J: D11 is a bit too far.  A safer way to escape is at F11.  Later, black can use it to reduce the left side.]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[ei]TR[di][ej][fj]C[J: this split knight's shape is usually means something is wrong.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[cf];W[ce];B[cg];W[de];B[bj];W[bk];B[dj];W[dk]
;B[bh];W[cj];B[ci];W[aj];B[be];W[bd];B[af]C[J: even though black lives, getting sealed in is not good.]
;W[qo]LB[jc:1][fm:A][ko:B]C[I managed to live small on the left but i feel i can practically resign here because of those two groups in the center that are really weak.
White got a good wall on the left and my stone on the top is in trouble too.]
;B[hi];W[ad];B[ae]C[J: A15 is a dangerous shape, and can potentially kill black's group.  But in this case it looks like it works.  See variations.]

(;W[hc];B[je];W[id];B[jd];W[ig]TR[id]C[J: White's J16 and J13 exchanges were very good.]
;B[if];W[hf]
(;B[jg]TR[he]C[J: Black can exploit white's weakness at H15.  See variations.]
;W[hg];B[jh]TR[hi]C[J: there is still some weakness is black's shape.]
;W[kk]TR[ih][ii]C[J: white aims at the cut.];B[lk];W[lj];B[kj]
;W[jk];B[mj];W[li];B[mk];W[mi];B[pj];W[ni];B[me];W[mm];B[ml]
;W[ok];B[nm];W[mn];B[ol];W[pk]LB[mk:B][ko:A]TR[od][gm][fo][gp]
C[Finally i loosed by time but i guess this group was almost dead...

Thanks for reviewing my game.

J: I think the main take awawy of this game is that black shouldn't play moves that help his opponent.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
