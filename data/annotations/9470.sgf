C[Hi, I am Felix and I am going to review this match for black. I will focus on the early game, as this is where black lost the most points.

I will write BX with X a number for black's Xth move. It is not meant as a coordinate.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[oc];W[po];B[np]C[You might consider a pincer as well to support your upper right group, but this is fine.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[Standard joseki, nothing special.]
;W[qk];B[on]TR[or][np][oc][qd]LB[jq:a][qh:b]C[This B13 is a severe error. Note how black's groups point toward the lower and right borders. You want to make use of the influence of these groups by extending somewhere around A or B, before white does so and kills your influence.

You should try to keep in mind to (roughly) first go for the corners, then the sides and lastly the center, as there are more points per stone to get out of the borders.

As far as attacking goes, B13 just strenghens white's group.]
;W[pm];B[pn];W[qn];B[qi]C[Finally :). Note that this move would have put more pressure on white had you not strenghened the group with your earlier attack.]
;W[hq]LB[kq:a]C[Now is the time to secure your portion of the lower border!]
;B[ok]TR[pj][om]C[This does (nearly) nothing for you. Even if white B19 white does not gain a lot of territory, and as far as connecting your stones go, white can still attempt to cut at the marked positions.
You do not get more territory here.];W[kq]C[And white uses it's chance to play where you should have.]
;B[lq]C[Unnecessary defensive move. And as always: Attaching strenghens your opponent, in this case greatly enhancing whites strenght on the lower border.]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[jn];B[ln]TR[mo][no][mn][nn]LB[cn:a][dj:b][jc:c]
[fd:d]C[This move is small. You can do rough estimates of the amount of points by imagening what would happen if both players were to close the territories at hand now. This move would result in a few points at best.

Attacking an enemy corner or going for any border will be larger most of the times. Examples would be A-D.]
;W[jl];B[ll];W[kj];B[dd]C[A good move. Still, white has an advantage at this point due to the strong position in the lower left quarter.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[be];B[dg];W[ci];B[di]LB[ei:a][ec:b][fb:c]C[Attaching strenghens the opponent here. If you want to attack the stone or reduce the potential of whites group you might try a more indirect approach via A.
B or C would be possible for taking the upper border and attacking white's corner.]
;W[dj];B[ei];W[ch];B[dh]TR[ed][dd]LB[eg:a]C[Bamboo joint at A would be better in combination with the marked stones.]
;W[fb]
(;B[hd]LB[ec:a]C[Play at A first for a stronger position (see variation).]
;W[kh];B[kg]LB[mh:a][hb:b][kd:c]C[W42 does not create white territory, and does not enter "real" black territory. Therefore a direct defense like B43 does hardly anything. In cases like this you have to ask yourself where you want black territory. If you want the right side play A, if you want the top maybe B or C.]
;W[ic];B[id];W[hc];B[lh]C[Good.];W[li];B[jh]LB[jc:a]C[The upper border is worth more than whatever territory you hope to create in the upper left or white's stones in the center, as they do not create any territory...]
;W[jd]C[... which is also clear to white.];B[je];W[kd];B[ke]
;W[gk];B[mc];W[cn]LB[cq:a]C[W56 takes the last good spot to attack from the outside, so the time has come to take the corner with A.]
;B[ej];W[dk];B[ek];W[eq]C[White takes the corner. This is worth more than the damage you can do by reducing white's territory.]
;B[em]TR[ni][pj][mh][hi][gi]C[Instead of reducing the opponent's territory you might want to consider securing your own first. Only attack when you do not have any weak points, such as the marked positions.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[mi];B[mh];W[ni];B[nh];W[oi];B[oh];W[ij];B[hi]
;W[rr];B[pj]C[White's group are quite strong. Securing territory would be better here.]
;W[lc];B[md];W[ki];B[ji];W[jj];B[rj]C[A bit weak compared to other bends.]
;W[qs];B[pr];W[rk];B[lb];W[kb];B[ld];W[kc];B[mb];W[qj];B[pi]
C[Ok decision.];W[ri];B[rh];W[sj];B[lr];W[sh];B[sg];W[ko];B[lo]
TR[is]C[Stuffing such a hole is very small. Also do not let go of monkey jumps if you have the chance.]
;W[si];B[qg];W[kr];B[ks];W[js];B[ls];W[jr];B[ka]TR[fn][gj]C[These bends are 2 points each. There still are bigger points on the board, e.g. the marked ones.

As the endgame was handled pretty well I will end my review here. Your biggest problems come are in the starting phase, where you seem to lack focus. Try to think where you want to have territory (be realistic) and place stones accordingly.
You react very defensive in some cases when white approached. Try to gauge wether you really need to react or not, even if this may result in some fighting (which did not happen in this game).

Lastly try to estimate how many points of territory your moves are making. Of course this is only a rule of thumb, as other criteria such as influence are also important, but it should help you.]
