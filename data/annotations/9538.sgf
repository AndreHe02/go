(;B[cf]LB[bd:A]C[SGF: This seems too easy on W. Playing simply at 'A' keeps things simple and keeps W separated.   See the variations.]
;W[bc]C[I misread the sequence and got a bad result here.

How should I respond to the non-joseki move of C16? I have no idea.

SGF: See previous variations.]
(;B[cb]LB[bd:A]C[SGF: No rush for this. After W connects at A these is a connection underneath for W]
;W[bd];B[bb]C[SGF: This does no do anything except make W connect all his stones.]
;W[bf]
(;B[bg]C[SGF: To optimistic.  The connection cannot be broken at this point so pressing at A looks much better.  See the variation.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[bh];B[dg];W[ch];B[fc]C[SGF: Too optimistic.B is never going to be able to catch these so a simple press is better.  It looks like B is panicking after the earlier mistalkes and trying too hard.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[fb];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf];B[hf];W[fg];B[gg]
;W[ff];B[he]C[SGF: B's position is not so thick and the 5 stone are almost lost.]
;W[mc]
(;B[kc]C[SGF: this seems way too close to the B wall.  I am tempted to try to seal W in as in the variation (or something similar)]
;W[me];B[oc];W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[pf]
(;B[ld]LB[pf:A]C[SGF: It is not clear what this is trying to achieve.  The two W stones have done there work by pressing B down onto the 3rd line so they are dispensible.  Capturing them does not strengthen the B stones.  I would be looking for ways to keep the stone marked A separated from the others.]
;W[md];B[lc]C[SGF: I don't understand this move at all.  It is dame]
;W[le]
(;B[qf];W[qg];B[qe];W[pg]
(;B[nf]C[I wanted to attack the group somehow, but I've never seen the shape before and got kinda impatient or smth. This was probably not the move.

SGF: It probably is the right move to split, but it is now a little late.  It should have been done before the exchange on the right.]
;W[oe]TR[qe][qf][pg][qg]C[SGF: Because of the exchange in the right the move is easily countered.  Imagine the situation without the marked stones.]
;B[ne];W[od];B[nd];W[nc];B[ob];W[mg];B[ng];W[nh];B[mf];W[lg]
;B[qn]LB[on:B][jp:A]C[SGF: It is hard to see how B can win now.  Having lost 11 stones (with 3 move for the taking) B needs to counter W's thickness with a moyo.  I would play at A now.  If W approaches at the circled point then aim big with B.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[fq];B[cn]C[SGF: This is no way to win.  A pincer is needed.]
;W[nq]C[Was k3 the right option or should I have given him k4 and enclosed corners?]

(;B[jq];W[cq]C[SGF: Playable, but I would be more incline to play on the fourth line to prevent a future cap.]
;B[dq];W[cp]C[Was there a better option that  what I played in the game?]
;B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[fr];B[es];W[bo]LB[jo:A]C[SGF: This sequence was not good for W.B ends up to strong on the outside.  As W I would have capped at A before deciding which corner to enter.]

(;B[pr]LB[mp:A]C[SGF: This move concentrates too much on the corner.You don't care is W jumps in there as the outside influence combined with the lower left is strong.  In fact, I would encourage W to enter.  What about A]
;W[fo]C[This move caused me to get into alot of trouble and I would've lost if white didn't make a mistake. How to handle this? Or was my mistake earlier?

SGF: See previous variation.  Q2 was wrong.]
(;B[fp];W[gp];B[ep]LB[go:A]C[I have a hunch that this is probably not the best move ^^

SGF: This is ugly shape.  Even B cuts at A it does not gain a lot.]
;W[hq];B[go];W[ho];B[gn];W[hn]
(;B[gm];W[kp]LB[mp:A]C[I didn't foresee this move.

SGF:  It is the only move to consider.  It is a very different game if B gets to play at A.]
;B[ip]LB[en:E][jn:C][mo:A][fs:D][ms:B]C[SGF: Is it worth saving this stone?  imagine the position after B preses at A, threatens with C and then later gets B and D.  W's territory would not be so big for all the stones invested. 

Not that B will necessarily get all these points, but it does show that W is not necessarily as well off as if there is a weak group to attack.  Don't forget, the group on the left has a weakness at E and it is not goo to havew two weak groups.]
;W[hp];B[kq];W[lp];B[lq];W[mp]C[SGF: Where is this going?  B cannot easily get out without causing distress to his left group.]
;B[io];W[hm];B[jn];W[en]C[SGF: the key point which B had to be expecting.  This is why trying to escape at the bottom was risky.]
;B[gl];W[dn]C[Here I got lucky. But it's hard to find what earlier mistake I made. Please help :)]
;B[fn];W[co];B[cm];W[el];B[em];W[hl];B[eo]C[I dunno why I did this...]

(;B[ln];W[mn];B[km];W[ll];B[kl];W[gk];B[lk];W[nm];B[jk];W[ik]
;B[kj];W[or]C[SGF: Now B has to live in the center.  While that is probably going to happen, having to do so is probably not going to provide B with enough points.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[pq];W[mr];B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[nk];B[mk];W[ml]
;B[nj];W[ok];B[oj]C[SGF: B is not making an points and is pushing W into where he needs to make points himself if he is to win,]

(;W[mj]C[SGF: Bad reading by W.   The variation is a one-way street and should lead to an easy win,.
