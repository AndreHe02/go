C[NukeMarine [7k\]: hi
NukeMarine [7k\]: Hi, my name is Charles and I played white.  Any comment would be appreciated.

wild : Hi Charles, I hope my comments will be useful to you. First things first, this is a game in which you won easily. These type of games are not quite suited for review because your mistakes or weaknesses do not show up. It is best to obtain review for games that you have lost. Anyhow, here goes...]
;B[pc];W[pp]C[kikopapa [8k\]: hi.
NukeMarine [7k\]: I always play the corner opposite a 3-4 opening for the approach move.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[kd];W[pe];B[nd]C[wild : I would prefer a pincer.]
;W[qc];B[pd];W[qd];B[oe];W[pf]TR[pc][pd][nd][oe][pe][qd][qc]
C[wild : The reason I prefer a pincer earlier is that with the stones set as marked, it is too slow to only make a 2 point jump at L16.]
;B[fc];W[df];B[fe];W[fg]TR[cn][fq]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: Here's one I wonder about. Is another move better (ex. D-12 or D-11)

wild : Compared to D11 or D12, this is fine. But I would have played C6 or F3.]
;B[ie];W[cn];B[cj];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq]
;B[bn];W[fq];B[fp];W[gq];B[cm];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cd]
;B[bc]TR[bb]C[wild : Mistake by black. Should be B18.];W[eb]
C[wild : Yes. Capitalise on black's mistake.];B[cb];W[ec];B[fb]
;W[bd];B[ea];W[qj];B[pn];W[np];B[ql];W[qo];B[lq]C[wild : Black overplay. Black will create two weak groups and will not be able save both.]
;W[qn]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: Here, as black let me take his base, I planned to chase him for profit.

wild : Yes.];B[pm];W[mq]TR[lp]C[wild : Not a good attack method here. I would play M4 to decisively separate them.]
;B[iq];W[mn];B[lo];W[nl];B[pk]TR[lo][lq][iq]SQ[ql][pm][pn]C[wild : It is easy to forget sometimes that we really wanted to chase the black baseless group for profit. Now, take a moment to think through what profit do you hope to reap from chasing this group, then follow it through with plays that are consistent with your goals. At this point I would like to note that black's triangle marked group does not have two eyes yet and it is still not connected to black wall on left side. Black's square marked group is also not safe. Which direction do you want to chase him towards?]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[ni];B[nk];W[ml];B[mj];W[mi];B[lj];W[jm];B[ho]
;W[kh];B[jj];W[kk]SQ[kj]C[wild : this kind of moves are typically not good. It helps black to strengthen its connections, thereby giving up the chance to play a cut at L10 later in the game when the opportunity arises.]
;B[kj];W[ih];B[hj];W[fj];B[gl];W[ip]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: seemed like an easy cut, black ends up killing himself though.
NukeMarine [7k\]: Regardless, a bad play on my part I think.]
;B[hp];W[hq];B[jp];W[io];B[in];W[jo];B[jn];W[ko]
(;B[kp]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: Here it seemed weird, I thought black would force me down and take my center stones.

wild : Yes. See variation.];W[kn];B[ln];W[km];B[mo];W[no];B[mm]
;W[nn];B[lm];W[ll];B[lr];W[mr];B[ir];W[nm];B[lp]SQ[jr]C[wild : Black should give up these 5 stones and save the bigger group below, e.g. with R2.]

(;W[hr]C[wild : No, black can save itself. See variation.]
(;B[kr]C[wild : suicide.];W[jq];B[ms];W[ls];B[jr];W[ns]C[wild : Effectively game over for black.]
;B[eq];W[er];B[hm];W[im];B[hn];W[hk]C[wild : This cut does not work.]
;B[ii];W[gk];B[jh];W[jg];B[hh];W[ji];B[hg];W[hl];B[fl];W[gf]
;B[hf];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[if];B[ig];W[jf];B[jh];W[je]

;B[eh];W[ik];B[ij];W[dg];B[ci];W[bh];B[bi];W[me];B[md];W[of]
;B[ad];W[ae];B[ac];W[bf];B[dr];W[fr];B[qq];W[pq]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: could q-2 kill this invasion? I've been poor at preventing corner invasions.

wild : This is an almost impossible invasion for black. There are many ways to kill it. Q2 and S4 are examples. This move is also possible. See variation.]

(;W[or]C[wild : This will result in ko.];B[rr];W[ps];B[qs];W[qr]

(;W[rs];B[sp];W[rn];B[sr];W[oa];B[na];W[pa];B[nb];W[ej]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: Odd that black misses this threat.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[dk];W[di]SQ[lm][mm][ln][lo][mo][lp][kp][jp][lq]
[lr][kr][jr][ir][iq]C[NukeMarine [7k\]: That should be game here, but black plays a bit more.
NukeMarine [7k\]: Are my responses the last few moves appropriate (don't leave black aji to exploit).

wild : I don't see any bad aji that black can exploit. Actually, the game was already over when marked stones were captured :-). Just imagine that the center black dragon is not dead, white would still win by a comfortable margin.]

NukeMarine [7k\]: ditto
NukeMarine [7k\]: review?
NukeMarine [7k\]: Black resigns at this point.  Thank you for your time.]
