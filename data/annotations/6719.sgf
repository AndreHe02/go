C[Hello I am just getting back into go and want to try to get back up to speed.  I am going to have surgery soon with a lengthy recovery so I am going to have lots of time to improve... I won this but should have done much better, I missed several things and black made it a long hard struggle to win.


***Dear Bill,

Hi, this is Bernard, I live in Hong Kong. I am 1k - 1d here, around 2k-3k on IGS. Anyway, I think that overall white proved a better player than black; whoever made less mistakes and blunders won the game. 

Something I don't understand is why white had 2 moves at 92-93. If you don't mind I would like to know the reason for that :)

I appreciate your reviewing yourself and showing me some variations. Please view your variations for comments. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.

In this review, I will enclose my comments with '***'. 

A couple of areas which definitely need improvement include:

1. Joseki
    Essential for a better early game and corner combat. No need to recite the shape and sequence, but worth studying.

2. Aji
    'Aji' literally means 'taste'. Leaving Aji means not settling a shape completely, gives room for change. When a shape is completely settled there is no room for more negotiation.

3. Tetsuji
    Tetsuji, usually used in combat. Read a book or two on it to learn some common shapes and do more Dead/Alive questions. A good place to start might be 'goproblems.com'. Doing more exercises may be tedious but you will see improvement in your game.

4. Patience/ Calmness
    Giving more thought may reduce blunders, and calm down to look at the whole board before continuing will greatly improve your game.

(;W[qr]C[Okay yeah white six was really bad.. I forgot that I was on the 3 line, thought it was the four line since I am usually black and keep to the 4 line... since white 6 is horrible what would be better

***
Not necessarily very bad, but not common. Usually this is not good because it does not make the best use of the stone. Not enough pressure on black, and leaving aji for black around the corner.

Depends on how you want to play it. Either play a pincer or make contact and settle the corner quickly. If I were white I would play a pincer and hope to make use of the stone at d-3.
***];B[lp]C[***
Not the best move by black. Black has no moyo so a simple move at m-3 would have been better; or, l-4. m-4 is too crowded (replicated and 'heavy'), and leaving weakness around k-3. White is semi-settled in the corner so black should want tro settle quickly.]

(;W[iq]TR[jq]C[How is the placing of 8, wanted to attack there but not sure where exactly

Not bad, but the shape is not optimal. Consider k-3, k-4. The distance between j-3 and d-3 is not good, along with the shape.

Redundant move, the black group on the right is settled and the white group is weak. SHould either make it bigger at q-10 or capture the territory on the left would be much better for black. It still looks better for black though.
***];W[hd]TR[ci][cf][ne][nc][pb][qb]C[Now I got to attack it

From my perspective this is very dangerous, but black does not know how to respond. I say this because white has 2 weak groups  (marked with triangles) near the combat area, and very likely a combat would lead to the death of either group.

The cut was not a good idea. Before attacking you should strengthen the weak groups first. Get out first should take priority, since after you get out (e.g. by h-12, you will still have sente wince black is missing a move.)

That's why it's bad. You settled the shape too early, leaving no weakness to capitalise on later on. Need to learn about leaving 'aji'. Now the white groups are in danger.

Very bad for white. If black plays correctly, pretty much has won the game. Attacking the black group and try to kill it seems the only way, but doesn't look like white has enough liberties.

Thanks for any advice.



***
It can be concluded that black has made the game a mess. Black failed to see white's many obvious weaknesses.

White needs to learn to strengthen weak groups before attacking and actually see the weak groups. White's attacking actually turned the game in favor for black by creating many weak groups, while black failed to capitalize on the weaknesses.

Black might still have a slight chance with a good end game now. See variation.
