AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Merhaba!

Sorry only Turkish I know.  In handicap games here is some good advice.

1 - Never get sealed in.
2 - Don't fight white too much
3 - Don't try to kill white unless you are 100% sure you can
4 - Try to make large moves.

You are too aggressive.  You need to wait until your stones are strong before you start attacking.   You died in the end because you attacked with bad shape.]
