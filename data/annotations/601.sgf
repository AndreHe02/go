;B[pd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[jd];W[cj];B[qn];W[nq];B[rp]C[A small point, but with 1 and 5 high, black should probably going for a moyo with 9bQ10.  White should not reply to 9 at the 33 point: it is rather small, unless white is very hemmed in and needs life.  The 2, 8, 10 combination is overconcentrated, and black has very good distribution.]
;W[qq];B[qk]
(;W[iq]C[Poor.  In a moyo competition, black has the advantage - it is his go next.  This is too low. How about variation, which is big, and retains sente.  A shimari is normally bigger than the sides, unless one is adopting a moyo strategy.]
;B[cn]LB[ce:a][de:b]C[Shimari at B would be best in my opinion.  shimari is normally bigger, and played before a kakari, especially against a 4,4 point.]

(;B[eo]LB[ep:a]C[A is better. (Var'n)];W[ep];B[qf]LB[nd:a]C[Interesting idea.  Another play locally (bottom left) would be one's first thought.  I think A would be better, facing the wider extension.]
;W[dl];B[fo]LB[go:a]C[Slow.  I would play A.];W[gp]C[Good.]
;B[fp]LB[fq:a]C[Bad.  This can be done later; white should reply at A.  But the exchange is bad for black at this stage because the black group is very weak, and this reduces liberties.]
;W[gq]LB[fq:a]C[A];B[fq];W[eq];B[go]LB[fr:a][cq:b]C[Why not keep going, to stop the white connection at A.  black A, then, if white plays a move on the outside, black B looks good.]
;W[jo];B[gr];W[hr];B[em]LB[er:a][bl:b][bo:c][fl:d]C[Slow.  15 and 17 are linked.  Black needs to stabilise.  A - D all look better to me.]
;W[el];B[cl];W[ck];B[bl];W[bn]C[Good, big, and eye-stealing.]
