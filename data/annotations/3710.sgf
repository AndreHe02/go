C[Hello, I'm Herv√© (also). I am 9k on KGS, and will try to help you through this review.. I will try to not bother you too muwh with strategy, and concentrate on tactics advices.]
;B[dj];W[cd];B[jj];W[ke];B[kg];W[ci]C[taorn [?\]: This is probabliy joseki but I don't know them so I'll try my best guess

H : 
- first coment : white's move is not a beginning of a joseki
- second comment : do not try to memorize josekis for the moment. try your own moves and see by yourself how it goes.]

(;B[eh]C[H: this is a good idea, but i'd rather play the variation if you want to make territory in the center]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg]TR[gd][jd]C[taorn [?\]: At this point of the game I feel I should play bigger insted of fighting. I would imagine maybe to play on marked points? Or should I pursue the fight?

H: do not leave the fight if your group is not settled.But C4 would be better. If white now plays D8 your stone is doomed.]

(;W[cf];B[bg];W[bf];B[df]CR[dg]C[taorn [?\]: Here I want to take marked stone in a ladder

H: You'll see that this was wrong.];W[eg];B[de]C[taorn [?\]: preparing the ladder...

H : yes, but no.. If white now plays correctly, your ladder cannot work. Try to find the move white should play, then check the variation.]

(;W[ce];B[fg];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff];B[gf];W[fe];B[fd];W[ge];B[he]
;W[gg];B[gd];W[fh]
(;B[gh]C[taorn [?\]: at this point I don't know what to do to respond. I try a double atari. But then how to exploit the position obtained with the ladder?

H : the position you got is extremely powerful. The double atari is ok, but there are better moves. The variations are a little higher level, but i will try to ewplain them clearly. They illustrate the principle that you should attack away from your power.]
;W[fi];B[hg];W[jc];B[dg]CR[bg][cg]TR[di]C[I think my move was bad. I thought W could cut there but it would have been in atari.  A better move at marked point?

H : you are totally right. This move is useless, and D5 is better. E4 is even better.]
;W[di];B[ei]C[H : good. You must keep white from connecting.]
;W[db];B[fj];W[gi];B[hi]C[taorn [?\]: New ladder.];W[cj]
(;B[bk]TR[ck]C[taorn [?\]: I try to protect the corner hoping to kill W group.
Maybe better at marked?
All the sequence that follows leads to W taking the coner and more...
 I think I made a lot of mistakes there


H: you are right, but white can live maybe. see variation.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[ck];B[ek];W[el];B[fl]TB[fe][ge][ef][ff][eg][gg]
;W[dl]
(;B[bj]TR[em]C[taorn [?\]: Probably a useless move. But I thought I could connect with b7 somehow. Playing at market would have been better but it meant accepting the loss of the corner.

H : that was a good idea, but the right move for this is A4, see variation.]
;W[fm];B[gm];W[em];B[ag]C[H : this moves is not udseful right now. If white plays there, you can make atari with A6. You must connect at G2 in this kind iof situation.]
;W[gl]C[H : and here you see why you must connect at G2.];B[fk]
;W[hl]C[taorn [?\]: Still hoping to connect]
(;B[bh]C[H : you don't need this move. See variation for an attempt from white to cut there.]
;W[bi]
(;B[gj]C[H : i don't think this was necessary (see variation). You should have played A5 (see next comment)]
;W[bl];B[ai]C[H : yes, but white was generous, because he could have played here instead of B2 and capture your stones..]
;W[ak]C[LaSente [?\]: oui mal lu
LaSente [?\]: non skuz];B[il];W[ik];B[hk];W[hm];B[jk];W[im]
;B[jl]C[H : good sequence from black.];W[ij];B[ii];W[gk];B[hj]
;W[gm];B[jm]C[At this stage I expect to take most of the right side. But still bad play to follow.]
;W[gb];B[lf];W[le];B[je]C[H : this is a bit too far. K8 would be fine.]
;W[kf];B[lh]C[taorn [?\]: I player there to avoid a cut but I don't think it's very good.

M7 would avoir the cut too, and avoir the atari that goes next from white. But the idea was good.]
;W[mf];B[lg];W[ie];B[jf];W[jg];B[ig]TR[jh]C[Is the move at marked better?

H: yes, but this one should also be ok.. J8 would also be good because it connects pretty much everything except the stones on the right. The lon white stone shouldn't be able to do much.]
;W[jh];B[kh]C[H : this is bad. You are removing a liberty from your own group, and your K9-K8 group looks in great danger if white plays J8 now.
J8 is the key move, but if you want to connect your stones on the right, then L5 is the move.]
;W[ji];B[if]C[H : good choice. If white plays here, your two stones are gone.]
;W[ki]
(;B[lj]TR[li]C[taorn [?\]: I want to connect the 2 groups. Is move at marked better?

H : yes, a lot... see variation.];W[li];B[kj];W[mh];B[ih];W[mg]
;B[id]C[H : K10 is better for capturing this sonte.. Please see for yourself why.]
;W[jd];B[mj]C[taorn [?\]: At this stage I just try to secure my position. I can't see any *big* move left.

H : your position is already very secure. All your stones are connected and you have plenty of eyes. On the other hand, there are still holes in white's position on the upper side. Since you are losing you could maybe try something up there.]
;W[aj];B[ah];W[ec]C[H : now it will be difficult...];B[fc];W[fb]
;B[af];W[ad];B[dd];W[dc];B[hb]C[Just trying to extend a bit.
There's maybe the corner to be taken.

H: the corner is secure. And your move can be cut off.];W[hc]
C[H : like this...];B[ib];W[ic];B[lb];W[jb];B[hd];W[kd];B[ld]
;W[ia];B[md];W[me];B[lc];W[kb];B[mb];W[la]C[taorn [?\]: Now the group is dead... This was a rather poor attempt to take the corner I suppose since it is quite clear for W what I am trying to do.

H : this was impossible, but it is always good to try and see if it works or not. And it doesn't cost you a point...]

[mm]C[H : I hope this review will be of use to you. At this stage, the best advice I can give you is to play againg and again, enjoy yourself trying your own moves, and try spotting which one are bad (it's easier than to spot  good moves, for anybody ^_^). You will undoubtedlu make progress.]

(;B[jf]C[H: the way to use power is to play far from it to enclose enemy stones. With this move you encircle from afar those two stones. As a bonus, you put a lot of pressure on the L9 stone.]

(;B[ej]C[H : the bamboo joint connection (between D6-E6 and D4-E4) cannot be cut.with this move you isolate the two white stones on the left, and put pressure on the ones in the middle.]
