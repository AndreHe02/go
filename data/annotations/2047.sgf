;B[ng]LB[pb:A][oc:B][jd:D][nd:C][lp:E][mq:F][nq:G]C[is O13 too slow?

reid: Hello Terry.  This looks like the second game I'll be analyzing for you.  For
the last game, I asked my teacher Jiang Ming Jiu to comment.  For this game, I
made my analysis, and then asked Ming Jiu for his opinion.  It is interesting to
compare his comments with mine.  It might make you think twice about accepting
advice from a "stronger" player :-)  Note that his comments are my paraphrasing,
not a transcription.

Yes, O13 is too slow.  The question is really "how much incremental gain
does this move give you?"  It looks like O13 only adds perhaps 5 points
in the area around Q12 - 5 points in gote is too slow.  Just holding the
corner with A (Q18) would be bigger, no?

Backing up a bit, I thnk O10 is too slow too.  White's O15 is a nicely timed
response, possible because black can't really attack the O8 group effectively.
Instaed of O10 (or O13), black could try something like B (P17, white C (O16),
black D (K16).

However, you should know that in Korea, only professional players are called "dan".
Amateurs are 'gup' (kyu) no matter how strong.  This means you'll see Koreans  ranked as 1 or 2 'kyu' who are stronger than American 6 dans!  If your opponent
is really Korean 2d, you may never have had a chance in this game.

Ming-Jiu: No, once black makes the R8-O7 exchanges, black *must* play O10 because
it's reverse sente - Black would have to answer white O10.  But black should start the B-D
sequence after white plays S7 instead of playing R8.  And D is better one closer at L16.
White S7 is not very important since even after this sequence, a black move at S5
makes white eyeless on the edge.

Instead of N4, black could start the B-D sequence.  If white cuts at N4, black E,
white F black G stops all problems.  Also, white should go one more space to O9
instead of O8.];W[qc]C[reid: Nice timing for white here.  Black has no good answer.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[qd];W[rb];B[rc];W[qb];B[lk]C[reid: The game already looks good for white.  Three corners, and only
the moderately weak O8 group to worry about.  For black, it looks like
there is no way to expand - white has outposts everywhere.

It may seem like attacking the O8 group is black's only way, but I think
it's too soon.  Black is just too thin to be able to capture and kill the
group. and getting outside thickness now won't be useful for black.
Better to be patient and leave this weakness for later.

MingJiu had no comment about that which probably means that M9 is OK.]
;W[ok];B[oj];W[on]C[reid: This gives white about 90% of a gote eye at A (P4).]
;B[pl]LB[nk:A]C[MingJiu: Black should atari at A (O9) first.  The one liberty difference
for the Q8 stones is not as important as reducing the aji of the knight's
move to M9.];W[lm];B[jl];W[jm];B[im];W[kl]LB[jk:C][kk:B][jn:A]
C[is L8 bad?

reid: No.  If white just extends to A (K6), then black L8 is sente.

L8 gives black three choices: A, B(L9), or C(K9).  None look very good.]

(;B[iq]C[can b cut at J5 instead of J3?

reid: Hmmm, looks dangerous.  Hard to see what would happen.

MingJiu had no comment, but we went past this move pretty fast.]
;W[jq]
(;B[hp]C[is j5 better than h4?

reid: Perhaps, but white is going to get away no matter what.  Black
is just too thin here.

MingJiu:  Yes, K3 is a big mistake for white, and J5 is the way to expose it.
See the variation]
(;W[io];B[kq];W[jr];B[kp];W[hq];B[kr];W[ir]C[MingJiu:  This is a terrible result for black.  Black lost too much territory.
White could also have played A (H9) instead of taking with J2 - that might
be even worse.  In any case, after this exchange, it is too hard for black.

I did not go further than this with MingJiu (but my comments continue).]
;B[hk]C[who is better at this stage?

reid: On the bottom (below the 6 line), white has about 25 while black has about 15.
On the right, black has about 22 (S16 and T8 are both more likely to be white's
than black's).  White's upper right  is 8 points minimum, and the D16 stone is
probably worth 5 to 8 points for a total of at least 12.  Black has some thickness,
and white has sente.  So it looks like it might be even.

But!  The problem here is that black has nowhere to build more territory - he can't
use his thickness.  White, on the other hand, can build territory almost anywhere.
And all the yose points look like they belong to white.  Black is in trouble.]
;W[fc];B[cf]C[is c10 better than c14?

reid: Well, black needs to gamble to get anywhere in this game,
but it looks like white is just going to play safe and wrap up
the game.];W[ce];B[ef];W[bf];B[cg];W[bg];B[ci];W[ch];B[dh];W[bh]
;B[di];W[jd];B[gc]C[is this the best invasion?

reid:  Since move 67 when we counted the territory about even, white has gained
about 15 points and black hasn't gained much of anything.  There is nowhere to
invade that can restore the balance.  At this point, black can only reduce white's
lead. But of course, a 1 point loss is the same as a 20 point loss.]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[fb];B[hd];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[md]
C[is N16 too early?

reid: No.  Again, black has to gamble.];W[jf]C[reid:  But white isn't giving black much to work with.]
;B[hg];W[hh];B[jg];W[kf];B[ih];W[nd];B[jc];W[kc];B[kd];W[ke]
;B[kb];W[ld];B[eo]C[is C6 better than E5?

reid: Perhaps.  But it's still too little, too late.];W[dn]
;B[dl];W[en];B[ho]C[is H5 too small now?];W[el]C[is b lost after E8?

reid: Hmmm, I think black's last chance to win was around O13.  After that,
white never left the smallest crack for black to exploit.  (But according to
MingJiu, your last chance was actually when you played H4 instead of J5).

This game provides an excellent example of how to keep the game simple once
you get the lead - how to win a won game.  White took no chances after he got
a good position, and he didn't have to make any fancy moves.
