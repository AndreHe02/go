RE[W+Resign]
RU[Japanese]

C[So, I am Black, around 4-5k and like to play in Shusaku style. I hate Josekis, and also a game without action.
I rather attack than defend.^^

Also I guess that my timing isn't the best ...
This game was about 2h. I hate to play with time, because it somehow  distracts me...

Comments with Variations are pleased :D Thank you for reviewing the game for me

Doumo Arigato Gozaimasu!!!


Hi,

This is Peter from Germany.
I am not much stronger than you both. So don't take my comments as the truth.

I prefix my comments with g4.

I hope you enjoy the review, as I did.

;B[hc]C[g4: I would like to finish the joseki. R13 becomes a good point for white.]
;W[cd];B[qh];W[ch];B[eh]C[I guess it was wrong but to play R5 was too passive for me I like fighting.
g4: If you want fights, a moyo game is good for you. Your opponent often has to invade, giving you a target for attack.
And with the follow up moves, B N17, W S18, B O15 a nice moyo appears.
I like this move.];W[dj];B[ee]C[rather bad but nessecary I guess]

;W[qo];B[ro];W[mn];B[of]C[I felt that one was the right one but after seeing w40 I don't think so
g4: I still like the sequence B N17, W S18, B O15. But I would like to play B15. Later you may aim at cutting off the 2 center stones with D8.]
;W[kp];B[er]C[g4: I would like to play L3 instead. It looks like sente.]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[jq];B[hr];W[io];B[hp];W[jp]C[g4: White got some stones in black's influence. But I think they are too loose. I would try to separated some stones with M5 now.]
(;B[fl]C[g4: This gives white a lot of solid territory. See the difference when playing D8 instead.]
;W[em];B[ml]C[g4: Playing for a moyo seems now unreasonable as white has entering points at O15, P10, F10, F16 and F7. If white defends here, his weakness at M5 will be gone.]
;W[mm];B[oo];W[on];B[pp];W[pn]C[g4: These stones are clearly unimportant. White should defend at Q8 or so.]

(;B[nr]C[g4: Very small. This is only good if black can kill white. How about O5 first.]

I couldn't turn the tables to my favour. And than I misscalculated again! with J11. In the end I resigned...

Doumo Arigatou gozaimasu! for reviewing.

g4: This was an interesting game. You missed some attacking moves. And in the end you were only slightly behind. In the endgame you didn't play some sente moves.
I hope some comments could help you.
That was fun to me. And don't hesitate to contact me.
