[na][ma][la][ka][ja][ia]C[You both missed that the white group can be killed\saved. Not that it would matter now.

Black does have more points in the centre, but he didn't won because he played more for the centre in stead of the corners. Black gave you a lot of fourth line territory and you can be satisfied with that. Most of those black moves were bad.

The first reason why you lost is that you didn't take chances to disconnect and attack the black stones. You played too much territory protecting moves. If you can get a good attack on an enemy group, that's usually worth more than a few points of territory.

The second reason is that your invasion in the strong black area was not consistend. You let black cut you apart. You can let black cut off a few stones and sacrifice them, but you cannot care for two groups in a region where black is strong.]
