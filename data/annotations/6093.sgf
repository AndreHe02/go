C[Hi Dan, my name is Joerg. I am a 6k from Germany and I am happy to review your game. I hope my comments help.]
;B[dc]C[sasuke7912 [16k\]: hi];W[pp]C[lucid [11k?\]: hi];B[cp]
;W[pc];B[qd]C[I'm not sure how I should have responded to this move.

Joerg: this is not a standard approach, so there is no standard joseki that I know of. When I encounter such a move, I assume it must be a bad move. So it is worthwhile thinking on how to punish black for his.]

(;W[mc]C[I do not think that this response is adequate.  Just look how close the black stone is to your white stone. Now W6 is too far away. B5 was a very direct attack.]
;B[nq]C[ You may consider playing tenuki here. The 4-4 point is very robust against attacking stones. It is more urgent to play kakari (attack that prevents corner enclosure) against the black lower left komuku (3-4) stone.]

(;W[pn];B[pf];W[ce]C[good. One of the urgent moves.];B[ph]C[I think I let him get too much on the right side with this move.

Joerg: B11 is too slow in this phase of the game. This is still the opening. B secures only little with this move.  I think this move is good for white.]
;W[fc]C[very good. You must exploit the B has not responded here. W12 also works well with the W stones in the upper right. You were doint right to ignore B11.]
;B[bd]C[B13 is not Joseki. B tries to secure the corner. But this corner will be small then and W gets a very good position.]
;W[be]C[the exchange B13-W14 was good for white.];B[ae]
(;W[af]C[B15 was a silly move. However with W16 your a following B. After B15 you can attack corner.]
;B[ad]
(;W[bf]C[W18 forms an so called empty triangle. (B14,B15,C15) which is considered a bad shape.]
;B[cd]
(;W[dd]C[W must:
1. connect with F17
2. seal B in

W20 does not achieve this. B can atari, come out and separate the white stones.]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ec];W[fd];B[fb];W[gb];B[fa]TB[cc][bc][ac][eb]
[db][cb][bb][ab][ea][da][ca][ba][aa];W[hc]C[good and necessary.]
;B[qk]C[B29 is again slow. If playing there (which is a mistake anyway) one position lowe (R8) would be far better.

If I was B, I played E15.]
(;W[eq]C[good move, but timing is questionable.

W30 lets B run against the W group on the upper left. This group however cannot be considered thick. It has bad shape and only few liberties. I consider E15 much more urgent.]

(;B[dr]C[B31 is unreasonable. B should pincer as this would help his lonely stone in O3.]

(;W[er]C[It may look that W32 is the obvious response, but I doubt that is there is no better move.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[do]
(;W[dj]C[Perhaps I should have played closer to his position.  I feel like this stone was too close to my wall.

Joerg: yes, it is. Your wall is not yet a wall, as B can break through with E15. When you use a wall (thickness), you must attack the enemy and drive him against this wall. So this is wrong direction, too.

The line of three stones E2-E3-E4 is very weak and need urgent support.]
;B[cl]C[The B group one the lower left is now secure. This means it cannot be attacked efficiently.]
;W[cj]C[E15 or K3 are more urgent. Do not focus on territory when your groups are at risk.]
;B[bk]C[Slow. B should play E15 and then K3. W would have hard times.]
;W[bj]C[The W stones are "overconcentrated". Too many stones for small territory.]
;B[aj];W[ai];B[ak]LB[el:B][bi:A]C[perhaps I didn't need to protect against the cut because it was so close to the other white stones.  I could have connected and killed any invading black stones.

Joerg: lets see]
(;W[bi]C[unfortunately necessary. B12 looks nicer.];B[ck]C[B makes bad shape with a superfluous move. This is like passing.]
;W[lq]C[W is lucky to be first here.];B[qq];W[pq];B[pr]
(;W[qp]C[I'm not sure if this was the proper way to play this position out.

Joerg: For me this is also always difficult to decide. Let's look at both alternatives.]

(;B[rq]C[This is wrong.]
(;W[rp]C[mistake. see variation. Always separate/cut.];B[mp]

(;W[lp]C[again: if B make  mistakes, you must punish him and exploit it. P2 still works.]
;B[or]C[W missed his chance here.];W[ee]C[B missed his cance there ;-) This move was very urgent since a long time ago. Good.]
;B[eb]C[??? B is in the mood of making presents.]
(;W[ql]C[W is right: this is the most endangered group around.]
;B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[rn];B[sm]C[??? non-sense.]
(;W[sn]C[I would have moved out to the center...];B[rj];W[em]
;B[dm];W[el];B[dl]C[??? another B non-sense move.];W[fk]C[good.]
;B[mr]C[slow. This move helps only W.];W[lr];B[ls];W[ks];B[ms]
LB[kr:A][jr:B]
(;W[kr]C[Both A and B protect the cut. When B is safe enough (and here I think it is), it has better shape for making eyes.]
;B[mq]C[very bad move.];W[pk]C[yes];B[pj]
(;W[nk]C[no.];B[mo]LB[lo:B][oj:A]
(;W[oj]C[I wasn't sure about this move, I was afraid of him cutting at P9

Joerg: certainly. You should have played P9 before. B should have played P9 with B81.]
;B[pi]LB[ln:B][oi:A]
(;W[oi]C[W84 here would be valuable if there was no black group in the lower right lurking its head into the center.

I think M6 is the better move here. Even better (there is more potential territory) is P15.]
;B[kn]C[The consequence of me playing high, this move shaped a lot of the middle play I think.

Joerg: right. B sometimes surprises with good moves.]
(;W[ko]C[I was unsure of this move.

Joerg: I think the direction is right. W shoud protect the lower side. K5 is the more efficient move.]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[io]C[I was happy to let him develop a little thickness because he was letting me built the wall so high and I had influence towards the center coming from other directions.  I think this proved true latter on, but I am still a bit unsure.

Joerg: You had little choice here. You must ensure the connection between E2-group and L1-Group.]
;B[hn];W[go]C[yes];B[ho];W[hp];B[gn];W[fo];B[fn];W[en];B[dn]
C[B99 is again a non-sense move]
(;W[jk]C[I believe this was a critical move.  However, I'm unsure if I should have played it closer to his stones or more conservativly in the middle.  He was able to make life in the middle, but small enough for me to win.  Perhaps I could have played this move better though.  This is when he gave me sente and I hope I used it correctly.

Joerg: B does not need to make life in the center, as he can connect to the living group in the lower right. Better for is W is to cut the B group off and let B run for life.]
;B[ln]C[B connects.];W[nf]C[Yes, good. I proposed P15 earlier, but O14 is probable the right move here.]
;B[ig]C[I was quite unsure how to defend against this move.  Countering invasions must be worked on.

Joerg: This B103 is reckless. B has almost no support for this invasion. B100 should be on J9 or J10.]
;W[gg];B[hh];W[gh]C[rule of thumb: stay away from the invading stones. Otherwise you may see your stones inder attack, which helps the invader.]
;B[hi]LB[hk:A][hj:B]
(;W[hk]C[I thought about h10, but decided it would be too greedy because the futures for that move look quite chopy for me.

Joerg: this move is right. Do not play too close. This move is just perfect.]
;B[gi];W[fi];B[ii]C[A bad move (empty triangle) for an invasion. Now B becomes heavy.]
;W[jf]C[Why here? Looks like defending territory. But the goal still is to kill this invading group.]
