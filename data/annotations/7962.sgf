C[I did not loose a lot of stones to the end so I lost because I was obviously overprotective and/or didn't spot the right moment to move in the center . I would like a review to focus more on the moment of going to the center and how I made the fight for the center and the errors in the corners that mabe got me to move late in the center . Also 2 moments in the fight for the center that I marked and I identified in my own analysis as critical .

R: Hi, I'm ilfuria, your reviewer. I will introduce my comments in the game by a "R:" in the whole file. If you have written anything I will reply below. I will review the game for black. At the end of the game I will try and summarize all of my remarks. Should you need clarifications, please feel free to contact me!]
;B[qp]C[*KMROCHGO*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
branco: hello

R: a little remark on this move is that it lays on the wrong side of the board… see variation]
(;W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[oq];W[pe]
(;B[qd]C[R: too small a move. this is good for white. See variations for some ideas and comments on "standard" josekis]
;W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[rd];W[qg];B[nd];W[qj];B[bp]LB[co:B][do:A]
C[R: this move is not good. It does not menace to do something effectively, nor it is a good approach for the corner: the group it creates is simply too small (it will live partly on the second line).
Remember never to play on the second line in the opening, unless it is necessary to live or kill.
Better approaches for this corner can be at A or B];W[do];B[cr]
;W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[bs];W[cp];B[bo];W[kc]
(;B[lc]C[R: this contact move is a defensive move for your group, which is not in danger, since it has the corner and can escape to the center using o16. This way you allow l17 to reinforce itself, thus not punishing the mistake of your opponent (l17 is a bit too far from d16). See variation]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[hc];B[cm]LB[cf:B][do:W][cp:W][jp:A][cq:W][dq:W]
[dr:W]C[R: I think that before this move there are two huge points, one around A and one around B.
A steals a good extension from the white wall, while extending from your shimari.
B is good since it is the last approachable corner (you can also invade in sansan if you like)]
;W[cj];B[ck]C[R: same mistake as before, this time worse. While on the upper part could be unclear if your group was strong enough to attack, this time you are absolutely alive in the corner. c9 is very small and reinforces c10]
;W[dj];B[dk];W[dg]
(;B[gd]C[R: I think you could've invaded in sansan before this one. The lower side can be even more urgent See variations]
;W[gc];B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[ge];B[ed];W[hd];B[ec];W[cd];B[cb]
LB[fg:A]C[R: when you're invading and/or trying to live in a difficult area, remember that the first priority is to escape to the center. After that you can live locally. I would've done F13 before c18]
;W[df];B[fc]C[R: you still are not completely alive, this move does not help you much]
;W[gf];B[dc];W[ne]
(;B[od];W[oe];B[bc];W[hq]C[I guess here I should have made some lower right or center moves

R: actually that was a priority before playing g16. see remarks and variations around move 34]
;B[bd]C[R: this move is small: remember that the d17 group is (or at least seems) alive. a play on the lower side, around l3 is the biggest point on the goban]
;W[de];B[be];W[kq];B[mq];W[ko];B[qm];W[pl];B[pm]LB[fk:A]TR[hd]
[kd][ge][ne][oe][pe][qe][df][gf][dg][cj][dj][ol][pl][do][ko]
[dp][dq][kq][dr]C[R: thjis is a mistake. White stones are working for a moyo in the center. It is of the maximum importance to steal some points from it, with moves like A
Your move only makes white stronger and tightens his moyo];W[ol]
;B[rk]LB[ek:A][fk:B]C[R: this move is also a fatal mistake: now white can prevent you from invating efficiently while you gain only a few points]
;W[rj];B[ql];W[qk];B[rl];W[le];B[gk]LB[fk:A]C[R: I think this is a bit too far and can be cut. The one-point jump at A should be better]
;W[oo];B[po];W[om];B[fg];W[ff];B[eg];W[ef];B[gg]C[Partida a fost amanata .
Reincarca partida.];W[hg]
(;B[eh]TR[eg][fg][gg]C[R: these three stones have been a good idea. but e12 isn't good since it makes a terrible shape (kind of an empty triangle) which can be easily cut and attacked.
See also variations at move 80 for the correct way to connect and reinforce your group. I provided many different variations in order to let you grasp the different ways you can make things work]
(;W[dh];B[ej];W[hh];B[jk]C[k9 seems like a mistake for the e13 group but I also need to get into his central area

R: yes, you need. with this move you give away the e12 stones, which makes pointless the fact of playing them. That is the strategic error.
By the way when you jump into the center use 1 point jump from a single stone, since the two point jump is weaker and cuttable]
;W[ek]
(;B[fk]TR[do]SQ[eg][fg][gg][eh][ej][gk][jk]C[R: ouch: wrong side! This way you let white escape towards his group. Furthermore the squared group is weak (it has no eyes and has an enormusly weak spot in e11) and it will struggle badly to make life in the center of enemy territory
see variation on previous move];W[ei]
(;B[fi]C[R: don't try to save every stone. Let go the four stones in order to make the opponent suffer in the center! See prev variation]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[ej];B[gi];W[el];B[gn];W[ho];B[hn];W[cn];B[bn]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[go];B[jn];W[jo];B[lm];W[jm]C[here I figure l7 would have been a good defense that would have grabbed more of his territory from the huge right group

R: uhm… I think that you're not completely alive, so your first priority is to make room eyes and stay connected. l6 looks good, l7 not much so, see variation]
(;B[kn];W[kl];B[kk];W[ll];B[ml];W[lk];B[lo];W[lj]LB[in:A]C[R: by allowing this move you should be aware that the A cut is effective now, since white cutting group can escape in the center and link up with some friendly group.

(;B[im]LB[ji:A]C[R: useless move. you are already connected. And you are connected, thus alive: you should try and reduce as much as possible above with A]

;W[kr];B[ls]C[R: it's too soon for this kind of endgame move. K11 is better]
;W[ks];B[jj]TR[jk][kk]C[R: try always to avoid this shape which is bad in almost all cases. a one-point jump should do the job better]

;B[al];W[sb];B[pa]C[R: I'll try and summarize my main remarks about this game

1) Remember to start in the upper right
2) Avoid plays in 1st and 2nd line in the opening unless really necessary
3) in the opening try to focus on open areas and corners not yet approached
3b) try abd steal the opponent's extension
4) As soon as the opponent starts to build up a moyo invade it or reduce it

I think this is all. Contact me if you need some clarifications or more infos.

(;B[ah]C[R: try always to do these moves, they rob your opponent of more points and, in this case, it is safe]

[eh][fi][gi][gj][fk][gk][jk][kk][im][gn][hn]C[R: not protecting the cut saves the right side of the group, but weakens the left side. I marked with triangles the major aji points which can be used by white. In particular the squared group isn't fully alive yet (if you play g12 white can attack the cutting points below and possibly deprive you of eyes)]

It is a minor convention, still many people consider playing elsewhere as disrespectful]
