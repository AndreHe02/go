;W[cq];B[pp];W[cc];B[pj]C[reid: hmmm, a classic confrontation between influence and territory :-)]
;W[nq];B[lq];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]
;W[kc]C[reid white is low everywhere.  stable, but hard to fight black's building moyo.]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[be];B[dg];W[fb];B[ld];W[lc];B[nd];W[kd]C[reid: white usually answers with p17 instead of l16.  there is some aji to cut through at p17.]
;B[le];W[mj]C[reid: this is pretty deep considering white has no friends nearby.  he is definitely behind enemy lines! (connect the outposts of black's positions in your mind's eye: from n5 to m15 - white is inside!).]
;B[kj]C[reid: good!  very consistent.];W[qj];B[qi]C[reid: this is the first move of black's that i might question.  when deciding which side to hane on, you need to judge which side is stronger (for black).  in this shape, it looks to me that the stone at q14 (being closer to r10) is just a little bit stronger than the r4 side.  also, there is no cut aji (as there might be if white pushes at o4 later).  the proverb says to "push him into your strength", so i think i would hane on the other side, at r9.]
;W[pi];B[qh]C[reid: hmm, now r12 and q14 look too over-concentrated.  i think i'd extend to s11, or from the other stone to q9 or p10 instead.]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[ok];B[qk];W[nj];B[oi];W[lk];B[jl]C[reid: good!];W[kk]C[reid: this push might be a bit aji-keshi.  the proverb says "cut across the knight's move, don't push into it".  if white can't play k9 right away, he should probably leave this for something else, like r8, etc.]
;B[jk];W[ql];B[rk]C[reid: perhaps taking is better here.  this move makes w s8 sente, where if you take with s10 instead, you might be able to ignore w s9.]
;W[rl];B[rj];W[nm];B[pm];W[pl];B[ko]C[reid: it looks like m7 is a vital point in white's shape.  i'd play there instead of l5.]
;W[om];B[dp];W[cp];B[do];W[er];B[gp]C[reid: black could probably play f3 instead of g4 here.  looks a bit better.]
;W[bn];B[cm];W[gd];B[gf];W[bm];B[cl];W[ig];B[ie]C[reid: how about j14 (contact) instead of j15?  looks a bit more severe, perhaps.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[if];B[je];W[ke];B[jf];W[ff];B[ge];W[fe];B[fd];W[hd];B[hh]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[df];B[eg];W[de];B[fh]C[reid: hmmm, this is a lot to sacrifice!  now white's corner/side is pretty big, and black's center has gotten kind of small :-(]
;W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[ic]C[reid: ah! well, this mitigates the loss of the e16 stones considerably :-)]
;W[gc];B[jc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[mc];W[mb];B[oc];W[md];B[me]C[reid: woops! looks like black is havaing a hard time deciding which part he wants to take :-)  but the corner is pretty big.  probably should defend before starting up with n17.]
;W[rc];B[qd];W[rd]C[reid: hmmm, just asking to get cut by black p18.  i think white needs to connect.]
;B[ob];W[ne];B[mc];W[nb];B[pa];W[md];B[od];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[kf]
;B[jg];W[ng];B[of];W[lh]C[reid: hmmm, white gets to connect, but black has taken back the corner.  probably a better trade for black.]

;B[dn];W[np];B[no];W[oo]C[mikke 3k*: intresting game!];B[on];W[rp];B[ro]
;W[rq];B[fq];W[fr];B[dq];W[dr];B[bh]C[reid: now white has 30 pts in the upper left, 5 in the n10 group, 10 in the lower right, and 20 in the lower left for 65 plus komi.  black's upper right is 35, so he needs only 35 in the center to win.  looks like the center is an easy 50, so b is 15 pts ahead.

black played a very consistent center-oriented game here.  his moves all worked together nicely.  by sacrificing 10 to 15 points (the e16 group) he was able to build his moyo and *still* invade white's top territory.

a very nice game for black! :-)])
