C[Hello dear reviewer!

My biggest question in this game is move 33.
Any comments to improve welcome.
I'm playing White and preceded my questions/remarks with fd.

Many thanks in advance.

Frédéric

Hi Frédéric,

I'll concentrate on white but will comment problematic black moves too. It was a nice game, but both sides made many blunders. If I should point out some things, it'd be:

1) Do not play endgame to early.
2) Count how much a play is worth  .
3) Play more solidly, do not leave cuts behind.

Good luck!

;B[nq]C[fd: what's the best way to answer this move?]
(;W[lq]LB[pq:A]C[fd: pincer

Commentator: I think this is bad - after black lives with A, you have an inefficient group as R10 is nicely ereasing the wall you create. R6 in your variation seems better (with a little correction).]

;B[qr];W[oj]TR[im]LB[qh:C][po:B][jn:A]C[fd: J7 is also big
