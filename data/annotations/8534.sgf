C[First of all, hello and thanks so much for reviewing the game. It was played in a tournament and we reviewed the game afterwards, so the thoughts, ideas and questions I mention here are actually the ones of me and my opponent. Sometimes I only added a comment without a question and maybe you could just write, whether the idea is right or I misunderstand the situation. Even though I played white, I would ask you to review the games for both sides as my opponent would also like to have an review. (I added the Email in the request.)
It would be great, if you could point out mistakes I didn't comment on, as we can't improve where we don't even realize the mistakes (or even misconceptions of Go). I think my worst weakness is the opening and judging whether a position is good or bad, so maybe you can keep that in mind while doing the review.

Thank you very much!];B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[ce];B[cg];W[pq]LB[cf:C]
[ci:B][cj:A]C[Is it okai to tenuki after the pincer? Of course, that was my plan as I don't really like playing against Chinese opening, but I wasn't sure, whether I should add a stone in the top left corner. I just couldn't find a good move (:

reid: sure, tenuki is OK, but if your original plan is to tenuki, perhaps a less aggressive move, like A, B or C would be more likely to get sente.  It's difficult to say that exchanging C15 for C13 (with no further followup) is good or bad for white.

You always want to avoid fighting where you are at a disadvantage.  As white, you are always a move behind, so it's not reasonable to expect an early aggressive move to yield good results.

And of course, just because black gets a Chinese formation doesn't mean white has lost the game.  It's one of many possible openings.]

(;W[pf]LB[jd:A]C[With b A, this would lead to Kobayashi-Fuseki, so I wasn't sure whether I should pincer directly  instead of letting black settle there. But I was worried about getting two weak groups and then hunted all over the board. Afterwards, I realized it might not be as bad (see var.) as I thought it to be, but still not really good.

reid: Yes, that would be a fighting game, but I think it's difficult to decide if it's good or bad.  If you are confidant in your fighting abilities, it could work.]

C[reid: This white move is a classic mistake.  The proverb discourages us from pushing our opponent along the fourth line.  A more general statement would be: don't help your opponent.

White might feel like there is no good alternative for reinforcing his stones, but the big picture is not so bleak.  White should note that the D17-F16 shape has a weakness which is to "cut across the kiema" with A.  Of course, it is too early to strike at A directly, but the josekis continue with white B (or C) which aim indirectly at the weak point of A.  See a joseki dictionary for continuations.

Since black was planning F16, perhaps he should have waited on Q18 and played F16 first.  Depending on how white responds, black might prefer Q18 to be at  D, E, or perhaps even F if white establishes a position on the upper edge.  However, black got lucky and white helps him out with the F15 G16 exchange.]
;B[gd];W[di]LB[kc:B][ld:A]C[good move? my idea was that black can't really play E13 because of w F13 threatening to cut at E12.

reid: I agree that black will be at a disadvantage if he tries to fight with C13.  It's 4 white stones against one black stone - not good odds.  Black would be better off abandoning C13 for now (leave it for aji, or sacrifice it for endgame profit) and instead complete his upper edge moyo with A or B.]

(;W[ek]C[This exchange (w E9, b C16) was pretty bad for white, as the connecion secured the groups on both sides without problems, made a lot of points for b and reduced the strength of the ponnuki by a lot. What can white do to get a better result?

see var. for my thoughts

reid: Yes, white needs to keep black split here.  I like the second variation at B16.  See my comment in that line.]
;B[cd]C[reid: Now white is in trouble.  The black stones are connected, so he has no worries.  But white has two groups with only half an eye between them.  And black has a significant advantage in territory.  Black should be able to cruise to victory at this point.]
;W[dn];B[cp]C[b should just have played F3?

reid: Yes, I think F3 or F4 is better.  Black may be concerned with white C4 if he plays at F4, but there is aji in the E9 stone that makes grabbing a lot of territory on the left side dangerous for white.  That same aji makes black F4 possible as well as F3.]
;W[fq]C[This move felt a little bit like an overplay, but I couldn't find an actual disadvantage for it. Is it okai?

reid: White's least concern should be overplay at this point :-)  He needs something drastic to get back into the game, so he needs to start gambling.  F3 exposes black's timid play at C4 as a problem.]
(;B[dl]C[This results in a wall for w and seems to be no good. Maybe b should ust break out with E5? (I don't find a good result for b F4.)

reid: Yes, there is no need for black to be picking fights as he is already well ahead.  He should just relax, sit back, and make more or less even exchanges.  He can expect white to be making desperate moves, so he should fortify his positions and not take any risks.

White of course should throw all caution to the winds.];W[el]
;B[dm];W[em];B[cn];W[en]LB[eo:A][fo:B]C[reid: white A or B would seal black in.  In the game, black gets to crawl on the second line, reducing the effectiveness of the white wall.]
;B[fp];W[do];B[co];W[ep];B[eq];W[eo];B[fr];W[gq];B[gr];W[er]
;B[dq];W[hq]C[b got a big corner, but w a huge wall. Is the game still even? I feel black is already leading as white has no actual territory and there is no weak b group that can be attacked with the wall.

reid: Yes, black is still ahead.  Black can still crawl at H2 and push out from F11, so the white wall is not very useful for territory.  And the white G14 stones are a burden - they are serving no strategic purpose and have only half an eye so far.]
;B[ie]LB[qk:B][ql:A]C[reid: Again, black doesn't need to take any chances.  The upper side is almost black's territory already (because of the weak white group at G14).

I think black should simply address the possibility of a large white moyo with a move like A or B.]
;W[kd]C[My idea was to reduce the territory on top. If necessary i would give up the ponnuki (for a few forcing moves) because then I could attack o17. But I think this is too straight forward. If I want to do something there, I should play around n15, because that would work well with my wall.

Is it big enough to save the weak group at g14? As I said, I felt behind and thought, if I just play at his pace and try to rescue it, I will just plainly lose, because I can't make any territory with it.
(PS: He kinda surprised me with h13 afterwards, because I expected j13, which would leave a ot more bad aji.)

reid: Yes, I think you're right.  White needs to gamble, and this looks like one good way to complicate things.]
;B[hg];W[qc]LB[jg:C][gh:B][ii:A]C[I though this is a mis between making territory and attacking the group. But still, o15 or n15 looks bigger now

reid: O15 runs the risk of allowing L16 to get cut off and swallowed up.  An alternative might be to sacrifice the G14 group forcibly:  White A threatens B, so black needs to respond if he wants to keep them.  Next, white C starts to make a really bit center moyo.  Still risky, but white needs the nuclear option now.]
;B[kb]C[reid: White L16 is proving surprisingly difficult to deal with.]
;W[qj]LB[pm:B][pn:A]C[reid: Which stones are stronger: Q14 or Q3?  I think three stones are stronger than 1, and the proverb implores us to "play away from strength".  R10 would be better closer to Q3, perhaps somewhere around A or B?

To summarize: problems started with F15 pushing black to G16.  But black took a decisive lead when white allowed him to connect his weak E13 group to the corner leaving white with no territory and too many weak groups.

White should take a look at the josekis for the upper left corner.  Both sides could focus a bit on basics: play away from strength and don't help your opponent.  Keep an eye on the big picture, and on the balances of territory and power.

Good luck, play strong,

(;W[kd];B[ne]C[Assuming black breaks through, what seems to make sense considering the upper left corner.]
;W[pf];B[ng];W[ph];B[hd]C[Would it make sense to play like that (for w and b)?
Even though w got two weak groups, w also got some territory on the right on thw pressure on each group is not too bad because b is quite far away and also still somewhat loose. Especially the corner is not settle yet. But I still kinda prefer blacks position.

reid: This is a joseki.  The question is: should white have exchanged C15 for C13?  I think white would rather have C15 somewhere else in this position.

However, white might choose to play Q12 at H16, which changes the whole picture.  If black Q12, white responds with Q18.]
