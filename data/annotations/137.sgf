KM[0.5];W[op];B[jd];W[cf];B[dh]C[I would play at either C12 or D11.   D12 will end up ackwardly placed  after the E14-F16 exchange.]
;W[ef];B[ce]C[This isn't a good idea.  F16 is  almost automatic after whites 1 space  jump]
;W[ed];B[dc];W[de];B[be];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb];B[db];W[gc]C[nj: At this  point I felt I'd already lost some ground, as my sanrensei      had become useless.  On the other hand, white's thickness was      held in check by my stones (though d12 looked too close), and i      had a decent corner.  GP: D12 looks funny now.  K16 is too close to white's thickness.  You would  rather have K16 at O17.]
;B[qp]C[GP:  not urgent.  I think K16 needs help now.  I  would play O16.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[rn]C[nj: I don't know the joseki  here (time to study...)  GP:  S6 looks right to me...]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[qr];B[jp]C[GP: right direction.   Perhaps a bit too close though.  Hard for me to  say.]
;W[cn];B[cl]C[GP:  F4 seems better to me here.  The left side is open at  the bottom,  so white cannot expect much territory from attacking D12.]
;W[cj];B[el];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[bn];B[dn]C[nj: At this point I was pretty happy.   It seemed to me like      c10 had induced my e8, which was a connection I would've      eventually wanted to make after d6 in the joseki anyway,      and I was ready to treat d12 lightly.  Plus I had the      beginnings of a nice moyo in the lower left.  Unfortunately...  GP: white retains sente though...]
;W[ej];B[gk];W[in]C[nj: Yuck.  This kind of  thing always shakes me.  What would      you have done?  GP: the value of your moyo is considerably reduced by the strong white group  at bottom right.  So just use the wall to attack J6.  K6 seems like a good  idea to me.]
;AB[kn]C[GP: yep.];W[ip];B[jo];W[ir]C[GP: this is a  mistake.  No reason to play on 2nd line here.  White  must continue running.]
;B[jq]C[GP: I would be tempted to play K8 now and let  white crawl on the 2nd  line towards his strong group.]
;W[gp]C[GP: this also seems like a mistake.   White must run out and sacrifice  whatever is necessary.]
;B[jl]C[GP: yes!];W[il];B[jm];W[gm];B[ek]C[GP: nice!];AW[hk]C[GP: This doesn't work.  J9 does.  See variation B.]

(;B[fj];W[ei];B[hl];W[hm];B[ik];W[gl];B[hj]C[nj: I was reasonably happy here,  figuring I'd at least sealed      him in and would likely be able to kill him eventually.]
;W[jk];B[ij];W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk]C[GP: this hane looks dangerous.  White will jump to L11 and  that hurts  your D6 group.  It also give white a cutting point.]
;W[ml];B[mj];W[ki];B[mm];W[nl];B[nm];W[ol];B[om];W[pl];B[pm];W[ql];B[qm]
;W[lq];B[rl]C[nj: At  this point, should I have played something around      q11 (where w played next) instead?  GP: white is trying to connect at K2.  You should play K2 to cut.  The white  G7 group will surely die then.  That is enough to win.]
;W[pi]C[GP:  white should  have played K2 here.  It is very urgent.];B[mh]
C[GP: both sides ignore K2...];W[jh];B[hg]C[GP:  you are too weak to jump this far.]
;W[hh]C[GP: and white  can see that...];B[gh];W[gg];B[ih];W[ig];B[hi];W
[hf]C[   nj 12k : is entering byo-yomi];B[jg]C[GP: this just helps white.  Your D6 group  is in serious trouble now.   K2 is urgent for both sides now.]
;W[hh];B[ii];W[kg];B[jf]C[GP: better to let  white have this stone and simply jump to N14 and  attack the white right side group]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[if];B[je];W[mf]C[GP: now you  are being attacked instead of attacking white...]
;B[lh];W[kh];B[lf]C[nj:  No idea what possessed me to do this.  GP: K2 is the urgent point.  But since you are both ignoring it, then perhaps  simply O13 here to split the white groups.]
;W[lg];B[le]C[GP: sacrifice the stone  and play O13.];W[mg]C[   nj 12k : i claim insanity :)  GP:  white scores a major victoryhere.  He kills the N10 group, thereby  connecting his 2 groups.]
;B[pg]C[GP: this is too far.  Perhaps O16 here.];W[nh];B[oh]C[   hockeyboy 9k*: is entering byo-yomi]
;W[oi];B[qk];W[nj]C[   nj 12k : trying too hard.  i should've just played o16  GP: Need 2 moves to secure cornerwith Q16.  Perhaps R14 and P17 here.]
;B[nd]C[   nj 12k : er, or o17.  i'm really not thinking now    nj: As you can see I was feeling kind of vocal during the game :)      It seems to me that there must be a better way to secure this      corner and avoid the eventual 3-3.  p16?  r16?  r17?  Or do      I simply need two moves here?]
;W[jb];B[lc]C[GP: this accomplishes little.  The  issue is still the D6 group.]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[em];B[dm];W[fh];B[fn];W[fm];B[ho];W[io];B[fp];W[go];B[fo]
;W[dk];B[im];W[hl];B[gn]C[   nj 12k : brain glitch.   nj 12k : maybe not...]
;W[hn];B[gq];W[hp];B[dl];W[jr]C[nj: D'OH!  GP:  the urgent point.  the game is over for black now.]
;B[gr];W[hr]C[   nj 12k : has entering byo-yomi again];B[cr];W[br];B[dr]
;W[cs];B[ds];W[bs];B[eq]C[   nj 12k : you can see the yellow streak down my back, can't you    nj: Was this actually too paranoid?  Was I alive without it?    GP:  If you do nothing, white can play F2 which threatens to cut, connect, or  destroy eyeshape.  I would play G1 here.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[qc]C[nj: There goes  my last hope for territory :)  Did I play      this sequence properly?  I wanted sente...]
;B[qd];W[pb];B[rc];W[rb];B[pc]C[GP:  I would play S16 here and then R12.]
;W[qb];B[ob];W[rd];B[re]C[   hockeyboy 9k*: has entering byo-yomi again]
;W[sc];B[bg];W[eh];B[mq]C[nj:  Thought I had some aji around here to cut at l2,       or make trouble for the white groups, but I couldn't      make anything happen.  Any suggestions?]
;W[mp];B[nq]C[GP: clearly O3 doesn't  work.  White can't be killed here, and K2-M3  are securely connected.]
;W[lp];B[lr];W[kr];B[ms];W[nr];B[or];W[oq];B[qi]C[nj: Blah.  Probably should've been s11 or something.  GP: R12.  Comments end here.]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[qj]C[   nj 12k : `By this time my lungs were aching for air...'    nj: Past this point the endgame isn't too interesting--I didn't      realize how far behind I was, and I was really tired, so I      fought some pointless kos.  (Feel free to slog through it if      you want, though :))]
