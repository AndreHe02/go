RE[B+5.5]

C[Hi, I will preface my review comments with "WOG:"

General Comments:

Most of my comments focus on play that's too slow, not big enough, or too direct.  Throughout the commentary, I'll mark things up with the RULE of Go is...  What I mean is the rule of thumb - how to make a better decision about what to play.

The other commentary is that when you're learning, don't have favorites or things you don't like.  You should be comfortable being uncomfortable.  When you play a tournament game, sure, then try to play your Go.  But, when not playing in a tournament game, you should experiment and allow all sorts of play.  Don't like or dislike moyos.  Don't like or dislike josekis.  There's so much to learn at 1k and so much variety that different styles can teach you!

Thanks for sending in the game.  I hope you like the review.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[cd];W[cp];B[ec];W[eq]C[WOG: While this is fine, it makes Black's next move rather obvious.]

(LL)

WOG: And they should know what they're doing!];B[of]LB[jd:A]
[qc:B]C[a different move than in the pro reference game...
(LL)

WOG: Interesting.  Is the moyo really that big now?]
(;W[jd]C[I don't like huge "moyo" so I played here to reduce it.
(LL)

WOG: I was joking in the previous comment.  You don't have to rush to reduce this yet.  While it's becoming blacker, the darkness hasn't completely enveloped the board. 

My larger comment, however, is not liking something.  At 1k, you don't have too much right not to like things.  You're asking for a review, therefore, I assume that you want to improve your Go.  If you want to improve your Go, then dealing with moyos is part of the territory (buh dum dum).  

Why high here?  Yes, closer to the middle and safety, but the RULE of Go is that every move has a good next.  Where's the good nexts for this move?]
;B[mc]C[WOG: This seems a bit cramped for Black, but still it does point to my previous comment and White not having a good next move here.]
;W[gd]C[WOG: What are these two floating White stones doing?  Yes, they're semi-connected, but now both sides of White are undercut - their only recourse is to move to the middle or take middle territory.  The RULE of Go is corner-side-center.  These guys have no corner or side.  They're way up there on the fourth line]
;B[fe]TR[ge][hf][jf][ld]C[how to answer here ???
(LL)

WOG: Black is playing another cramped move locally.  That's fine, I suppose.  It works well with the side stone at c10.]

(;W[ge]LB[ff:B][gf:A]C[WOG: This continues making crampedness for Black, but it's playing a bit heavy.]

(;B[gf]C[WOG: Interesting]
(;W[hf]C[WOG: White has a number of directions to go to "save" these stones.  I'm not sure that this is the right move.  Seems like it's helping Black significantly... and, if you can cut then you'd be better off, right?  Problem is strange because the White stones have no base... you put them up in the stratosphere.  Interesting problem.]
;B[gg]C[WOG: Black's much happier];W[jf]C[WOG: If you were trapped inside a tight spot, sure this could be a defense to go to, but you're not in a tight spot, so this is too timid.]
;B[cm]LB[pi:B][qi:A]C[white has developped attacking the white's group : what should white do before ???
(LL)

WOG: I'm not sure what the question is here.  Seems like Black could have made a more serious attack against the White stone at r14]

(;W[qi]C[WOG: Hrmmm.  This move seems like picking a miai before you have to play it.  You can jump in the corner or take the side.  You take the side.  When you have miai (you don't have it exactly, but you do have it some), don't play one of the choices till you have to.]
;B[op]C[WOG: Now Black breaks];W[mq];B[po]C[WOG: I am not familiar with this joseki... Seems bad for Black.  Too cramped (a theme for Black) and aji for White to connect underneath]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[qn]C[WOG: Consider jumping instead of continuing to push]
;B[pl];W[qm];B[pm]TR[jp][jq][mo][oq][ql]C[what is the direction, now ???
(LL)

WOG: You'd like to help stone N3 vs. the new Black wall... so K4 seems fine, but you have the turn at r8 which is monstrous.  You can consider a probe]

(;W[jp]C[trying to make points while attacking the black stone... but it has not work !
(LL)

WOG: This is fine locally];B[ql]TR[oi][pq][rd]C[WOG: Harsh.  This turn is severe]

(;W[rd]C[WOG: fine];B[qc]C[WOG: Seems rather local and too small]
;W[rc]C[mistake ??? this move is not urgent !!!
(LL)

WOG: Right.  The prior move didn't necessitate a response from Black, this move ESPECIALLY doesn't require a response from Black]
;B[mo]C[WOG: Yikes!  This is WAY too close to the Black wall.  This is a WALL.  A WALL is a great thick thing.  It should not be played next to by either player... otherwise, it's not a wall.]
;W[pq]C[WOG: Yes, it's somewhat big locally and is otherwise Black's right to reduce White in the corner here, but it's such a one meaning move.  RULE of Go: try to play moves with more than one meaning... especially on move 36!]
;B[hg]
(;W[if]C[WOG: Too timid];B[ko]C[WOG: I don't understand this move... Is the wall trying to be territory?!  RULE of Go: Never make your wall territory until it's time.  It's not time yet.]
;W[kp]C[WOG: You don't need to connect your stones.  This is fine territorially locally, but...]
;B[lp]C[WOG: ugh!  Never force this sort of thing unless your play clock is at 1 second]
;W[lq];B[do]C[with some forcing moves, the black "moyo" has increase and is now fearsome !!!
what was white mistake ???
(LL)

WOG: See previous comments... you've been too local: s17, q3, l4, r11]
;W[jh]C[WOG: This move is trying to be more than one meaning, that's good.  It's helping White stones and reducing the moyo some... 

At this point, however, you need to count.  If the count of the moyo is substantially more than this minor reduction, then you need to take the chance of not helping the group on the top and go for a more substantial reduction, or invasion.  The point of Go is not saving a group ;^)  The point of Go is winning by more territory]
;B[hj]C[WOG: Seems like a very good exchange for Black];W[in]
C[WOG: Again, you need to do the accounting.  Is this enough to balance the territory/win?]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[pg];W[qg];B[ph]LB[pi:B][rj:A]C[again forcing moves...
(LL)

WOG: Yes, rather pointless]
(;W[rj];B[gb]LB[fo:C][hb:B][hc:A][oj:D]C[white has a choice, here.

WOG: Big move by Black.  D seems more interesting from your choices - more meanings!]

(;W[hc]C[WOG: Is White otherwise dead?  No.  You have to read the score anyway]

;W[oj];B[kc];W[jm];B[jc];W[jl];B[jj]LB[kk:A][lg:B]C[WOG: This move separates the White group but that group still is rather eye-full]

[op][pl][pm][pn][po][ql]C[white wants to attack the "Triangle" stones, but "Square" stones are also weak...
