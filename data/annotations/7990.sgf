C[Dear Reviewer....
at the first,I would like to tell You that My English is not so good.But I hope You can understand what I mean as well.
Okay...I played White in this game and I lost by 2.5 points.And this game takes me back to 6 kyu.I also included coments & opinions and added some variations.I did some mistakes in this game.So I would like to know what need to be improved by me as well(fuseki,yose,etc)
Thank you for take your time in reviewing this.

Hi,

as you will see during the review, you play an interesting game that you lose on LL sequence and on yose. Unfortunately, yose is not my stro,ng point but b took 2 of the three big endgame moves and especially s3, the strange thing is that it's the biggest of the three has been taken in last.

My English must be full of mistakes, my go too, I'm just around 1-3k on KGS so I hope this review could help you but don't forget that it is just how I see your game, not how it must have been. We surely have different styles and the most important thing is playing moves that you like ;)

*you're reinforcing b without need because you still have d13 to reduce. I would prefer taking territory with e3 than e8 because there's less room for invasion but it's a matter of style. with e3, it's safe cash, with e8, you must have confidence to take later benefits for w invasion at e3. Now with f10 in place the o8 hane became less interesting (that's why I consider c10 in place of k4)]
