my questions will be marked with [dts\]



[dts\] Please comment on both white and black and point out any mistakes I don't see. Also general comments about my game, fuseki, middle game, yose,direction of play, and spots for improvement etc. are very much appreciated.



[dts\] Can you also suggest any books to read for low dan players and high dan players? Can you also suggest any additonal study tactics.]
;W[cd];B[pq];W[nc];B[pf]LB[qk:B]C[Instead of playing at q14, is it possible for black to play at B to directly  form the chinese opening?]
;W[ic];B[qk];W[po]LB[np:A]C[janr: usually, it is best to play on the most open part, in this case in the lower left.  This white group will have no good base quickly.

[dts\] after white plays the kakari at q5 what are the options for black? I know A is one of them.

janr: A is the best move I think.];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]
;W[qm];B[nn]C[[dts\] is o4 the correct direction of play to continue pressuring white?]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[qj]C[janr: This looks like an overplay.  Usually, white just lives on the right.]
;B[rl];W[pk];B[ql];W[pl]
(;B[qi]C[janr: this reinforces white.  I would prefer to omit this move and try to punish the overplay (see variation)]
;W[pj]C[[dts\] I feel like white escaped to easiy and ends up with superior counter-influence and sente. Did I play any incorrect moves here?]
;B[sk];W[pi]LB[qh:C][qi:B][ri:A]C[[dts\] there is a weakness at A. (this weakness is important for white at around move 60) How should I have best protected it?

janr: given that black played the atari at B, I guess extending to C now is the right continuation.]
;B[qh]LB[om:B][pm:A]C[[dts\] the cut at A is vulgar. How else can I pressure the group?

janr: I think that just playing on the left of the group (extending the black wall etc) will at a certain point make it necessary again for white to spend moves on this group to get eyes.
Cutting seems not urgent.  Possibly just peeping at B is also an option black wants to keep open.]
;W[fq];B[jq]C[janr: the move is far from white's weak stone and close to blacks strong wall.  The proverb advises to pincer closely to the weak stone and far from the wall.]
;W[dn]LB[en:A]C[[dts\] how do i respond to d6? is the k3 pincer okay?
janr: one of the joseki moves is at A.  I think it is hard to avoid white getting the corner as black only has a stone on one of the sides (and it is far).]
(;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[do];W[cr];B[dl];W[go]
(;B[en]LB[gn:A][hq:C][jq:B]C[[dts\] after e6, i felt like i benefited very little while white not only lives but has sente again. What should I have done?

janr: the last move is very submissive.  It would be normal to play hane on the top of the two stones at A.
If only the pincer at B would have been at C, variations as played here would have been impossible for white.]
;W[cj]LB[lc:C][ed:B][ch:D][ej:A][en:E][gn:F]TR[ic][cd]C[[dts\] White formed the formidable double wing formation (in triangles). now i need to reduce or invade the expanding white moyo. Where is the best place to invade? I was considering A, B, or C? Is there another tactic to invading?

janr: I don't like A as it invites white to close his territory without building useful influence (too far from the weak white group on the right, and the white group on the lower left is coming out already).
B is the standard move.
C is possible.
D may be an alternative which tries to exploit black's influence (which would have been better it E would have been at F).]
;B[ed];W[df]C[[dts\] what is the best response to c14?]
(;B[gd]C[[dts\] would play c17 been better? (see variation)
janr: C17 is the standard move here.  I don't see a reason why it would be bad here.
This black move does not give any base for life.];W[dc];B[ie]
;W[kd];B[fg];W[eh]C[janr: the stones are only running, while white makes territory.]
;B[kf]TR[ed][gd][ie][fg]C[[dts\] i realized i missed something important because white's territory just increased tremondously while the marked stones have little function and are instead a liability.]
;W[pb];B[om]LB[fh:A]TR[pk][pl][qm][po][qp]C[[dts\] i wanted to peep first, pressure the marked group while  makomg a wall. Then I would increase my territory. Is this a logical tactic?

janr: it will be easy for white to connect.  Probably black will want to answer a push at A.  all other white groups are stable.
So the attack is not very urgent.];W[pm];B[nk];W[ro];B[rq];W[on]
;B[nm]C[dtslife [1k\]: my reducign scheme seemed to backfire

Cookies [-\]: :o

Cookies [-\]: doesn't really mater if i die ~.~];W[pp];B[op]
;W[qn];B[jn]LB[ri:C][rm:B][oo:A]C[[dts\] here is where i jumped out. but white is alive in miai.

we exchange either a  or b and there is a weakeness at c.

janr: black makes a few points in the center but not much.  Answering in the upper right corner is bigger I think.]
;W[ej];B[gi];W[mi];B[ji];W[qc];B[qd];W[bp]LB[mc:B][ld:A]C[[dts\] what am I supposed to do now? Where are the vital points on the board besides A?

janr: B is at least as interesting as A.  Else, white does not have any weak points.
This means endgame will start.];B[ld];W[lc];B[kc];W[kb];B[mc]

(;B[bq]C[[dts\] is b5 better than b2? (see my variation)

janr I think b3 is better than b5 now.  White will not let his C6 stone die on such a large scale as in the variation?.]

;W[dj];B[gk];W[fm]C[[dts\] i believe i am dead here. however, white ad a misread. is there any tesuji here for black?]
;B[fn];W[gn];B[fl]
(;W[gm]C[[dts\] seems like white should have just wedged. (see variation)

janr: indeed.];B[em]LB[gr:A]TR[cb][db][bc][cc][bd][ce]C[[dts\] at this point where can i continue playing? g2?  is there any way for black to exploit the top left hand corner area?]

;W[oh]C[[dts\] the yose begins around here. you can end your comments here or provide a little bit of general commentary about opening, endgame, and yose?  Where should did I not take advantage of my 2 stone handicap?



[dts\] Thanks for the review?];B[eg];W[dg];B[is];W[gs];B[ap]

;W[jb];B[ia]C[janr: In my opinion, both sides missed some chances.  Black did not succeed in attacking the white   group on the right, White got a nice corner in the lower left.  Black made no territory with his invasion in the upper left.  
White did not protect his cut around N17 on time.  Endgame could be improved.]
