C[Hello,

My name is Julien Wiesel. I'm french. I play on KGS, with the nickname "LeWiZ", where I'm about 4k now.

Here is my review of you game. I will try to use my best english ;-)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[cg]C[This is a quite rare response nowadays.]
;B[id];W[kc]LB[qf:A][nq:B]C[This move is aggressive. 'a' and 'b' are also possible.]
;B[jc];W[nc];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb];B[pf];W[qe]CR[qh][ph][pi]
[qi]C[I think this move is played too early. It is better to use it as a threat for the future, when white stones will be present juste below. Here it just makes black stronger.]
;B[qf];W[pe];B[oe];W[qd];B[qc]C[Now black is stronger for attacking the left white group. The three white stones have no chance to survive.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[rd];B[rc];W[sg];B[sd]LB[rh:A]C[A move at 'a' would have been enough to kill all white stones.]
;W[qg];B[rh];W[qh];B[pb]C[Good. Now it's time to attack the white group on the left ! ^^]
;W[ri]LB[me:A][jb:B]C[It looks very dangerous to spend one more move here while the group on the left is attacked. I would have defended at 'a' or 'b' now.]
;B[lc];W[of];B[re];W[ne];B[nf];W[me];B[sf]C[Why do you spend a move here ? The white group on the left is very weak. Maybe you won't kill it, but for sure you can have a large profit by attacking it.]
;W[kb]C[Now white is happy and has a free move to consolidate.]
;B[jb];W[kd];B[og]C[Okay. Notice that locally, the white group on the top is not completely alive.]

(;W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np];W[qq]LB[ro:A][qk:B]C[Too early. Black can simply play at 'a'. If white wants to save his stone in the corner, black will use his thickness on the north against the two white stones. Black can next play at 'b' so the two white stones can't get any help from the three weak stones just above, and are now attacked.]
;B[pq];W[pj]C[Good. The white stone in the corner is left as a big yose move.]
;B[pi]C[Ouch !
This move has a very small value. It doesn't do anything for black and helps white to build. It's a "thank-you move".]
;W[qi];B[cc]LB[dc:A][db:B]C[This move is strange too. Now white is going to build a wall by playing at 'a', and the black group on the right will be attacked. 'b' would have been enough for black. It would have stabilized the black group.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec]C[Now the black group is severely attacked !]
;B[fb];W[da];B[ca];W[ea];B[bf];W[ce]C[This move is not useful. The corner is already alive, there is nothing to do here.]
;B[be];W[jf];B[if];W[ie];B[he];W[jd];B[hc]LB[je:A]C[I would have simply captured at 'a'.]
;W[je];B[cn];W[fd]LB[gd:A][ha:B]C[I would have attacked at 'a' or 'b' instead.]
;B[gd];W[ga];B[fa];W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[ic];W[ha];B[ia];W[hf]
LB[cl:A]C[Black is alive now. There is no need to cut here. I would have played in the lower left corner now.]
;B[ka]LB[gb:A]CR[ia]C[There is no need to do that.];W[la]LB[cl:A]
;B[ja];W[lb];B[gf];W[hg];B[fe];W[eg];B[df]LB[ck:A][fq:B]C[White already has no eye. There is no need for this move.]
;W[cf];B[ef];W[dg];B[ck]C[Ok !];W[bg];B[ad];W[ek]C[Nice.];B[en]
;W[cm]LB[dm:A]C[I don't think you need a contact play here. 'a' is more usual.]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[bk];B[cj];W[bj];B[bi];W[bn];B[co];W[bo]
;B[aj];W[al]LB[cp:A]C['a' looks very big.];B[bm]
(;W[bl];B[bp];W[am]LB[ci:A]C[You don't need to capture now. A cut at 'a' seems better.]
;B[ao];W[cp];B[bq];W[ci]C[Yes. Now white will live.];B[bh];W[ah]
;B[ap]
(;W[ch]C[There is no need to connect here. (see variation)]
;B[an];W[ai];B[bm]C[Ouch !
Now black is alive in the lower right corner, and the group in the middle has a base.]
;W[bn]C[1 point gote move ! ^^];B[fp];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[dq]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[hq];B[kq]C[Now white is attacked.];W[jp];B[jq]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[lq]LB[iq:A]C[Good. White gets a free sente move at 'a'.]
;B[mq];W[lr];B[kr];W[lo];B[mp];W[iq]C[Sente.];B[ls];W[jr]LB[ro:A]
C[Small move, not urgent. Now 'a' looks big.];B[mr];W[dk];B[go]
;W[ho];B[ko]LB[ro:A][nm:B]C[There is nothing to cut here. Black can get territory with a big move at 'a' or run into the center with 'b'.]
