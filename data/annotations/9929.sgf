;B[pp]C[Paul: This game was out of my comfort zone, not much life and death action and pretty much heavily based on moyo. Since it was really close I probably would've been able to win it if my endgame was stronger.
Time control is 10 minutes for 25 moves canadian and i spent quite a lot of periods compared to usual so i was pretty knackered by the end of it, ( 3 or 4 i think)

I counted the board quite more than usual(probably like 5 times) in this game, counting takes ages but i think i'm getting better at it.]
;W[dq];B[pd];W[dc];B[do];W[cm];B[eq]C[CG: This is an unususal move.]

(;W[dp]C[CG: Linking up while securing the corner is the natural response.
If you are afraid of the moyo, you can also play the hane at E2.]
;B[ep];W[co];B[dn];W[cn];B[jq]C[Paul: i flet like this was a good result for white, since i got the corner, later on, that bottom became all moyo

CG: I agree that this is a good result for white. 
The important point is that a moyo is not territory.];W[dm]
C[CG: This is the first white move I want to critizise. 

This move is much too slow. 
Globally, O17 is much more important.
Locally, turning is also bad: You could also cut at E5. You should not help black to remove the cut since this strengthens the moyo.
Black gains much more territory locally than you do!];B[fn]
C[Paul: not sure if this exchange was good or bad, i thought it was good at the time

CG: See my comment regarding white 14.]
(;W[qn]TR[nq]C[Paul: Is the triangle a possible invasion point in this scenario? I don't think it so i played there but it gave black a wall and then loads of territory

CG: Yes, R6 is better than O3 (it's better to approach from the outside than from the inside). Globally, however, O17 is more urgent since it also serves as an extension from your stone in the upper left.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on]
(;W[qp]C[CG: You can also play R5.];B[qq];W[qo];B[pq]
(;W[qj]C[CG: This is a joseki move, but in this situation reducing the moyo becomes urgent. Capping at K5 looks good here.]
;B[om];W[pl];B[jn]C[Paul: I thought i was doing ok here, but i probably was behind

CG: I would definitely prefer to play the black stones now :-)
The bottom side is almost territory now - and very big. You have solid positions - good for fighting - but it's difficult to find a place to fight. 
It's actually difficult to find a good move now. 
O17 looks natural, but how to respond to the pincer? In my opinion, you don't have a good answer, so you should probably approach high at O16.]

(;W[nc];B[lc]
(;W[qf]TR[qj][pl][pm]C[CG: This is the wrong direction. The marked stones are low and over-concentrated - you can't expect to get much more points than you already have there.]
;B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qd];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[og]C[Paul: this left a really good ko for black i think i should've played r13 instead.

CG: I agree!];W[ph];B[le]C[Paul: This is so small, but probably necessary?? i felt like losing to an opponent that played a move like this seems a bit demoralising. but maybe the o16 stone could've done something.

CG: No, this move is not good.
Even if O17 could escape, this would be no excuse for M15. 
Approaching the remaining corner at C15 or D15 is much more important.]
;W[hc];B[cg]C[CG: This is another bad move by black, you are recovering. Allowing C15 as a pincer and a corner enclosure is too good for white.]

(;W[ci]C[CG: I would rather play C15. You are already strong in the lower left and don't get many additional points.
C15 encloses more additional points in the corner, *and* you create a group whch is not definitely alive. D17 is not as strong yet, so black can easily settle his group while reducing the corner!]

(;B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[dd];B[bc];W[de]TR[dc][hc][dd]C[CG: The marked stones are too narrow - which means they are not as effective as they should be.
If nothing spectacular happens, black will win easily. 
Actually I would say that right now the margin is closer to 15 points than to the final 4.5 points ...]
;B[cf];W[fl];B[hm];W[eh];B[eg];W[ll];B[ln];W[ol];B[bh];W[bi]
;B[ai]C[CG: This is a bad move. At this early stage, white can play elsewhere.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[gq];W[aj];B[ah];W[bk];B[ib]
(;W[hb]C[CG: This move make your position even more over-concentrated. Black gains more points than you do.]
;B[ic]TR[id]C[Paul: really not sure about this move decided to be safe, the left black stone poking out is deterring me a bit

CG: Black is very strong on both sides, so the hane (on the top) feels like an overplay.
However, if the hane does not work, you should extend.]
(;W[ia]
(;B[ja]C[CG: Black can consider to play H16 - this is the reason I would prefer H16 for white.]
;W[ha];B[kb];W[hd];B[id]C[CG; Too slow. C18, F15 and S3 are bigger for black.]
