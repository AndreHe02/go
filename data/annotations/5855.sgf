C[Hello,
Even if I won that game, I have a lot of questions about it. Especially about fuseki.
Best regards,
Arnauld (aka. milouz)


[JB\] I hope I can help. Really, your questions are very hard to answer for me, because in most cases I cannot find a unique answer; you made me work a lot more than usual :P
I will try to do my best, please consider my comments just as my opinion: the most important thing is that you understand why you do something, otherwise it will not work.
As an advise, I could only say that you are playing better than you think. You are too concerned about killing groups, while the profit you make (in territory, strength and influence) while your opponent gets life is more important than that.
Best regards,
 Jorge (aka. brindis)];B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pq];B[ce];W[qo]LB[jc:A]
[cj:C][qj:D][cn:E][fq:F][jq:B]C[Milouz : White played in a symetrical way. That's puzzled me. What to play next ? I identified several big points from 'A' to 'F'.

'A' and 'B' seems the biggest because they form/destruct moyo on north/south.
I think C and D are big but not so big as A or B because it's harder to develop from shimaris.
F is subject to a pincer and hard fight for black.
Maybe E, which I develop on a variant branch

[JB\] I like K16 in this position. White would probably continue his symetrical play, but who knows. I prefer K16 instead of A because the shimari is strong enough and you do not want to be low on that side.
Extending to C does not look good (it is the "small side" of the shimari), while E or F would be acceptable,
Your variation on E is too good for black, notice that white may choose another joseki (e.g. e pincer) or play R14 instead of L3 (see the variation 2 of your var.2).
BTW, I found 2 professional games with this opening, following as in variation 3.]

(;B[jq];W[jd];B[nc]C[Milouz : I decided to attack the white stone by pushing it against my shimari on upper left.

[JB\] This is correct. The important thing is that if he answers your move, you have a good extension near Q10.
Another possible answer, seen in some pro games, s M17, but at my level it looks difficult to explain... :-)]
;W[gc];B[qj]LB[fq:A]TR[nc][pd]C[Milouz : well... I'm not totaly satisfied by that play. I don't like shape formed by my triangle stones. Maybe a bit weak. I wanted to play 'A' also, but it seemed more urgent to me to play R10 to help black stones in the corner.

[JB\] The triangle stones are very healthy, you can be attacked or invaded but you do not have anything of concern here yet. And since K3 can move both ways (A or N3), it is not urgent.
So, it is time for a big move, and this one is probably the best for this reason.]
;W[cj]C[Milouz : I think it's a mistake because white stone in D4 is still weak.

[JB\] This point was very big, it is important to play here for white in my opinion. Again, notice that
- C10, K3 and R10 can extend to both sides
- D4 can be attacked by it is not weak really (ok, not more weak that any stone in the hoshi at the beginning of the game). K3 is there, but the left and bottom sides (or the corner and the center) are miai.
Anyway, it would be probably worth for white to play first M3, and once black plays i.e. G3/F3/F4?, play depending on that answer.]
;B[fq];W[qf]C[Milouz : another white mistake that reinforce me

[JB\] Yes, this is a mistake because I think tenuki is not good now in the bottom left.]
;B[qe];W[pf]LB[qh:B][ql:A]C[Milouz : hesitated between 'A' and 'B'

[JB\] R7 is better than A, though a bit passive.
Notice that if it were white turn, he would play A and black would answer B. It is a good reason to think that R7 is good. In this part of the board, white is one time behind.
See also my comment in your var.2.]
(;B[qh]LB[qm:A]C[Milouz : I still wonder if 'A' was better. But I wanted to rob white base.]
;W[od]C[Milouz : white trying to sabaki...

[JB\] mmm... this may be an overplay.]
(;B[pc]C[Milouz : my corner is vulnerable. Q17 reinforce it.

[JB\] I insist it is not weak. Probably you'll have to give something in exchange, but it is ok (this is the way it works: one cannot expect to get everything).
I added some variations so you can check, but I am pretty sure the correct answer here is P17. Please let me know if you find a better white answer to P17...]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[pe]LB[nb:C][pb:B][qd:A]C[Milouz : lot of cutting point in my corner... I certainly missed something.

[JB\] That is one of the reasons I prefer P17, though initially I choose it for shape reasons...]
;B[rd]
(;W[nd]C[[JB\] I think white should better atari at S15 to avoid connection with R12, and then attack the black stones at the right while making profit in the lower right side (see Var.2). My sequence is slightly different from the actual game but the idea is the same.]
;B[mc];W[re];B[qd]TR[qh][qj]C[Milouz : triangles stones are totaly weaken now... But still I do not understand what was my mistakes.

[JB\] I think the main problems have been R12 instead of R7 and Q17 instead of P17.]
;W[cn]C[[JB\] Now white should play R8 taking the initiative. He has time for something near C6 later...]
;B[dr];W[mq]C[Milouz : I think white should have attack with R8 or defending the corner with C3. N3 is big but put no pressure on black

[JB\] Yes, definitively R8 should come first.];B[qm]C[Milouz : black is safe now. I feel lucky !

[JB\] Yes. Let's analyze the position now.
Black is ahead by about 10 pts (not considering komi), and the white stones at P16-Q15 are not safe (N16 is big for black) which should account for the komi.
It looks difficult for white to get back.];W[cg]C[Milouz : wasn't the corner biggest with C3 ?

[JB\] Yes, but still not big enough.];B[cq];W[cp]C[Milouz : I think I have the advantage with 3 corner and only strong groups.

[JB\] Right. B3 is big but N16 looks like a must now... see variation.]

(;B[bq];W[md]C[[JB\] As I pointed before, this point is very important for both.]
;B[lc];W[lq]LB[cl:A]C[Milouz : white reinforce a strong group
What to do next ?
White on upper side could be attack, but there is a big cutting point in 'A'... so I'll play there

[JB\] M3 would be better at N5, but you are right, A and the top side are more urgent. Also, since white is behind, he should play more agressively. M3 (or N5), anyway, prepare an attack at H3, so you may want to play K5 for example (you do not need to attack too soon if you are ahead).]
;B[cl];W[dm];B[dk];W[ei]
(;B[ek];W[hq]LB[gp:B][hp:A]C[Milouz : I played 'A'. 'B' is a variation.

[JB\] You can see the purpose of M3 now.]
(;B[hp]C[Milouz : I think it's a big mistake. G4 was the point because it will help the 4 white stones]

(;W[iq];B[ip];W[gq]
(;B[gp]C[Milouz : luckily, white missed the point and only weaken his own stones.

[JB\] You are right.
Note: I think F4 can be played here, though it is difficult to read out... I added some variations to give you an idea of what I think.]
;W[jr];B[kr];W[kq];B[jp];W[ir];B[fm];W[eq];B[fr];W[fp];B[fo]
;W[ep];B[er];W[bp];B[bl]C[[JB\] B7 looks better... though the follow up looks quite difficult due to the possibility of white E8.]
;W[ee]LB[df:A]C[Milouz : big ! But wasn't it more urgent for white to defend ? Anyway, I want to keep white separated and I'll play 'A'

[JB\] Yes, white could be killed now and I think it is more important. Anyway, your choice.]
;B[df];W[cf];B[de];W[go]C[Milouz : I realise now that my stones are not so strong !

[JB\] The problem is that you have 2 cutting points, G5 and E8-F9. You had the same problem (too many cutting points) in the top right, so you should train on connecting shapes.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[in];W[eo];B[fn];W[em];B[gk]C[Milouz : white live, but I think it was safer to protect the cutting point.

[JB\] Right. Though I am not sure white lives...];W[aq]C[[JB\] ...see variation below. Since you do not want white to make an eye, you cannot lose one time.
Probably you can kill, or force a ko fight.]
(;B[ar];W[ap];B[bs];W[an];B[ef];W[en]C[Milouz : white protect an already alive group.

[JB\] This one has big aji, see next variation];B[he]C[[JB\] Still, M16 is a good point to make 3 weak white groups. And you have to be very careful with white F8 now, see variation.]

(;W[hd];B[ge];W[ie];B[fh];W[fi];B[gi];W[eh];B[fg];W[bf];B[be]
;W[bi];B[dg];W[dh]C[[JB\] I do not find a way to kill this white group...]

(;B[af];W[ag];B[bh];W[ch];B[dj];W[di]
(;B[ro]C[Milouz : all my attacks lead to nothing. It's often the same in all my game. I can see some opponents weakness, I but never really now how to exploit them.

[JB\] You have followed the rule (1st reduce eye space, 2nd take the vital point) but that white group was alive probably.
And a note: in go you do not have to kill a group to be successful. You did not kill those 2 white groups, but you got about 10 points in exchange after the fights.
Before these fights you were about 5-10 points ahead considering komi, now you are 15-20 points ahead. So you were successful. Additionally, you have strong influence and probably the center points will be split, so it is very difficult for white to come back unless he finds a very big weakness.]
;W[rp];B[ad]C[Milouz : Silly. But I was in byo-yomi and was bit in a hurry.

[JB\] Yes, very silly, and quite strange. If you played S5, S6 would have been more natural. In byoyomi you usually play a sente move you have been looking for in advance, or continue at the place you were playing...
BTW, white does not need to defend here (see variation)]
(;W[aj]C[[JB\] Not needed.];B[ah]
(;W[ai]C[Milouz : well.... no comment ^^

[JB\] White did not need to play this one either (see variation).
So white lost 2 moves. He could have recovered with those moves...]
;B[rn];W[qp]
(;B[mo]LB[nh:A]C[Milouz : I'm trying to make a moyo on center. but I think that attacking with 'A' was better.

[JB\] The way to attack is still M16, which splits white in two. Of course if you just want a big moyo A may be better.]
;W[oh];B[oj]C[END OF MY COMMENTS
Milouz : The game is not finished, but I thinkg I have an advantage and that I lead with about 20 or 30 points. However, I have the feeling that I failed a lot of things and when I see all white mistakes, I wonder why I'm not more ahead.
In fact... I really can't see what I failed.
So, thank you very much to help me.
Best Regards,
Have a good go :-)
Arnauld


[JB\] You are about 10-15 points ahead now according to my count, though you are in position to increase the difference in about 10-15 points more (eg M11 now would be huge).
Maybe you feel you could not take profit of white mistakes, but: (1) white did not fail at living, and (2) white failed in establishing in the whole board, and that's why you are ahead.
Remember: go is not the capture game, it is the game of surrounding. You succeeded in surrounding white and that gave you an influence worth as many points as your current territory.]

;W[ni]C[[JB\] White is being careless with his group. It is much easier to make it live than to connect.
So, trying to connect, white has been playing neutral points while helped you to close your territory.
Here, O12 would have been enough to connect AND live.
White would have lost for about 15 points anyway.
