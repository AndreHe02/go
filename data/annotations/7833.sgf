C[CentaurusA [9k\]: salut bonne ^artie


Hello dear reviewer.

It is my first review... thanks a lot !


romp: Hi there. I am 2k on kgs, and a bit rusty to boot, so take my advice with a grain of salt.]
;B[pd]C[pockitup [8k\]: lut et bnne partie];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp]
;B[op];W[pn];B[lq]C[romp: this move is pretty bad because black still has no base. see vars]
(;W[pf]TR[pq];B[qh]C[played there to avoid a too big white moyo on the right...

romp: this joseki isn't a great choice as you probably noticed. In the beginning, it is simple and good to play where you see the most potential.]
;W[qf];B[qk]TR[nc][nd]C[to get some place to build eyes

romp: I would take a triangle instead.];W[pi]C[I was suprised by this move...]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[rn]C[I hesitate between
Q10 P10 P9 => toward center

and S6 => fragilize the Q6 group...];W[qn]C[Was Q9 better for white ?

romp: this move is better.];B[rm];W[od]TR[ne]C[Q9 still better for white ?

romp: this move is a bit too aggressive I think. triangle keeps black from solidifying too much.]
;B[oc];W[pc];B[nc]C[I decided to give up the corner... to build a moyo on the upper part...]
;W[qc];B[nd];W[oe];B[jc]C[there !

at this point my position was good...

romp: this was a good move.];W[fc]TR[cf]C[romp: this is the wrong side.]
;B[hc]TR[df][cg]C[romp: awful. you messed up a big chance here.]
;W[fd]TR[cf][df];B[ec]TR[df]C[
not a very good move...

D18 better ?

D14 ?];W[de]C[good for white];B[ce];W[ed];B[cc];W[df];B[cf]
;W[dg];B[ff]C[now i am alive in the corner...

so I attack his shape...

but a little too much I guess :)

H15 enough ?

romp: I think this might be a good idea, but it seems a bit premature. When you see a cut like this, try to make sente moves elsewhere, so you'll have more support later on.

If you want to play here directly, I would play g15 instead.]
;W[ef];B[ge];W[gd];B[hd];W[he]C[in trouble...

romp: nah.]
(;B[hf]TR[fg]C[romp: this helps white];W[ie];B[if]C[now I'm cut... so I have to live on my own...

romp: a fight is invariable. at first glance, I thought this was outright good for you, but the bottom is in some danger...]
;W[je]
(;B[gh]C[to get some shape

romp: noooo! I would certainly fight here. see vars.];W[ne]
;B[le]C[too far ?

the idea was to put pressure on the K15 group and get out of the top to go in the center...

romp: too far. the o17 stones aren't strong enough to support this move.]
;W[kf];B[lf];W[kd]C[I didn't saw this move coming...];B[kc]
C[to protect my top territory];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[ke]C[my idea is that white will have to do 2 moves to connect L16 and L14...]
;W[jf];B[jd]C[I cut to be able to put pressure on the white K15 group...]
;W[lg];B[mc]C[sente];W[me];B[jg]C[I use the sacrificed stones to develop

romp: don't fool yourself. white did not have to answer.];W[kg]
;B[jh];W[dj];B[fq];W[dq];B[fo]C[romp: this was good];W[en];B[cl]
C[have to invade !

romp: don't panic! I would start with r3, which will settle your bottom, and remove white's eyes.  r3 is astonishingly large right now.]
;W[dl];B[cm];W[dm];B[bo];W[hq];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fr];B[iq]
C[to prevent too much damage to my possible territory];W[eq]
;B[fp]C[romp: too small];W[fn]
(;B[in]C[to prevent the cut J4];W[ck];B[bq];W[bp]C[B3 was wrong ?
B4 better ?

I invaded because t was too big to give hime the whole left part...]
;B[cp];W[co]
(;B[cn];W[cq];B[ap];W[cp];B[br];W[cr];B[bk]C[B7 better ?];W[bj]
;B[al];W[bn];B[ao];W[an]C[dead :(];B[eo];W[dn];B[ci]C[to get compeansation ont the lost]
;W[cj];B[cg];W[di];B[bi];W[aj];B[eh]TR[qq]C[peep to extend my group]
;W[dh];B[gj]C[I use the dead group to get some compensations ;)

romp: again, I don't see how.];W[gl];B[il];W[hk];B[hj];W[ik]
;B[ij];W[jk]
(;B[nm]C[I thought I was alive in G12 and I got to develop elsewhere

romp: this move is thin. see var.];W[nn];B[rq]C[S3 was used to prevent white of having a base
 I thought I could connect with S6 or P4...
But P4 was weak...

overplay ?

In the end the result was good for me... but a stronger player would probably punish me here...

romp: different, but not bad I suppose. I still prefer r3 though.]
;W[qq];B[rp];W[or];B[oo]C[peep just to gain force to attck below...]
;W[on];B[oq];W[nr];B[pr];W[pq];B[qr]C[I had not read this... the fact,that the empty triangle for hime forced hime to protec it... otherwise my 3 black stones at P4 would have been in trouble...]
;W[ro];B[so];W[qo];B[mp]
(;W[om]C[There I thought it was not possible for me to block th P7 white group to connect to K9 or Q11... so I let it go...

Was it wrong ?

romp: no. just fyi, w can still cut at s2.];B[mm]C[Played N7... P8 better ?]

;W[rg];B[re];W[qg];B[qd];W[rc];B[rh]C[I thought that this move was clever to save the stones... or more probably to avoid a big invasion from white]
