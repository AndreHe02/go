;B[en]TR[fp]LB[cp:a][dq:b]C[W's answer will hurt the marked stone, so this isn't recommended. c4-d3 is normal.]
;W[fo];B[cj];W[cf];B[dc]LB[cp:a][dq:b][qp:c][po:d][rq:e]C[correct invasion ?
what else ?

It is a possible invasion.  e18 or f17 are alternatives.

Exchanging c4 for d3 and r4 for q5 are important moves that should be played first. W c4 and W s3 are sente more or less.]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[hc];B[cb]C[Good. W should have played here himself.]

;W[dj];B[di];W[ci];B[ck];W[cl];B[bl];W[bm];B[ej]C[I don't think this is sente. B is thick but he lost too much on the left.]

;B[bn];W[kq];B[dm]LB[fm:a][am:b]C[This is poor technique. B loses the chance to save a stone in the endgame with a7 and f7 still threatens to cut. W had nothing useful to do here anyway.]
;W[bk];B[pn]TR[fo][kq]LB[qp:a]C[With the marked W stones in place, the outside isn't very big. Taking the corner with r4 seems bigger, something that could have been played earlier too.]
;W[qn];B[po];W[qp]C[Now B wants to play in two places. This reveals the error of playing like B did.]
;B[qq];W[pp];B[pm]LB[op:a]C[An important shape point, but P4 is even more important.]
;W[op]C[Pushing out through a narrow gap is always big.];B[oq]
;W[pl]C[B's three stones are feeling heavy.];B[nn];W[ol];B[no]
C[o4 works better. B can stay connected if he feels he needs to. But he should always be ready to sacrifice the three stones. With o5, he is clinging to them.]

Hopefully this answers some of the questions about the opening. I've taken the liberty to end the review here, as the rest involves to a lot of complex fighting that would be quite a lot of work to comment on.]
