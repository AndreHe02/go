C[Hi! Thankfull for any pointers. Mostly of global nature in this game I guess. Hope you don't think the game look too easy.

Hagios: My comments will be proceded by "H:" to help differentiate from other comments/questions.]

(;W[ci]LB[cf:A]C[H: This allows black to form two shimari, which is considered better for black.  W should approach at A or prevent this opening entirely (see earlier variations)]
;B[cf]C[H: As black, I would already feel happy];W[dg]C[H: I'd respond to this shoulderhit]

(;B[pj]C[Emphasizing territory but I've been told D14 is a better move to lessen w capacity to extend towards bottom

H: Yilun Yang recommends this sort of splitting move on the third line so that when W approaches the stone it is more stable.]

(;W[pm]C[H: A bit odd for W, I'd generally prefer to approach low, to undermine the stone's stability.]
;B[qf]C[Breaking line to prepare for r16];W[qe]C[H: This is not usually a very good idea.  It encourages q14, which is a good shape for B (remember the proverb, "extend three spaces from a wall of two stones")]

(;B[re]LB[qc:A]C[H: This was not such a good idea.  Before, B could invade at A.  This helps to secure W's corner which gives W more than B.]

(;B[pf]C[H: During this sequence you worried about a some captures worth only a few points, taking gote too often.  See the variations for some other ideas.]
;W[ld]C[H: White played well here, and it looks like W is ahead now.]
;B[jc]C[H: This is too close to a strong white position.  You had to hold back some.  d13 already has made your position weak.]
;W[kc];B[je]LB[jd:A]C[H: When stone touches stone, 9 times out of 10 you want to extend.  Like this leaves the weak spot at A.]

H: Overall this was not a bad game at all for B.  You made some mistakes and left some openings for W to attack, but W didn't take the opportunities.  You should work on reading by doing tsumego and tesuji problems, and you should work on yose (a weak point for most kyuu players).

If you have any more questions, feel free to message me on KGS.]
