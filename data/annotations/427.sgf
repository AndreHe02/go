(;B[qq]C[Too early, I think,  and not the right place for an invasion, since Q3 makes 3 and 14 work  to maximum efficiency.  (O3 or Q2)

Should take advantage of the fact that W ignored 13 from the point of  view of the group to the left, so W should strengthen his weak gp by  attacking 12,12, and 2.  Um, perhaps D6]
;W[pq];B[qp]
(;W[po]C[Better  at R5];B[qo];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[qr]C[W will reply, so better at  Q2.]
;W[pr];B[qj]LB[dn:a][fm:b][ie:c]C[If going to play about here then  should play S7 first.  This just ends up far too near W strength.

a, b, c, and S7 are all better.  I think I like G6 best.  a then is  viscious, or you can flatten the W moyo a bit at  J7.]
;W[rm]
(;B[sn]C[This gives W the sente move at T7 instead of T6,  which can adversley affect stones above, but is not too bad.: the  corner territory is bigger, and at least 25 is not at R9 when it  would be almost completely wasted.]
;W[sm];B[rp];W[qf]C[Good];B[qd]C[Probably also good, but with the W strength W might want to  mix it by responding at the weak point of  O17.]
;W[ph]C[Good];B[oj]
(;W[nl]C[I would want to play P14 here, to  strengthen the weak group.  You should not fear another B move  towards your strength.  This is a "greedy" attitude.]
;B[md]C[Ordinary O16 is probably better.  To attack you do not want  weaknesses.  Look how weak the W gp is now.]
;W[ng]C[B is so weak, he  must come out at N10.  I can see why ...];B[rh]
C[... this is  tempting, but it does not really strenthen B, but the exchanges help W.

Black cannot attack the flexible gp above as he is too weak.  This  does not give him an eye, because - the root of all B's troubles - he  is too close to the W strength  below.]
;W[re];B[rd];W[qi];B[ri];W[rk];B[pi];W[qh];B[oh];W[og];B[rj];W[nh]C[Black
 nearly has to  play at N10 here, and at this point it becomes  obvious that he should have played N10 earlier, and the effect of his  plays in contact with a weak W gp have mad it stronger.          In fact,

a)  the life of the gp  is saved by the shortage of liberties of 32,  44, and 40; and

b)  even so W gains, as he ends up  (in my variation) surrounding B,  playing at N10, where B should have played in the first place.  Don't  get surrounded!]
;B[oi];W[mj];B[pg]
(;W[pf]C[Chicken!  B recoups a lot  here.  Now he is almost infinitely strong.  Even if you cannot read  it all out, (and I wouldn't be able to really, but)  it is clear that  after going the other side, R13, the W gp can drive out, and B will  still have a weak group to look after.]
;B[qg]
(;W[qh]C[Very wishful  thinking! DoesB really need to make another eye immediately?  These  two tactical mistakes more than make up for Black's several strategic ones.

Put another way, you now are losing a game in which you have  consistently  played better, strategically, but have thrown it with  two hasty moves; or your reading is extremely weak, and you need to  do lots of easy tesuji  problems.]
;B[of];W[nf];B[oe];W[dn]C[Good];B[ed]
(;W[cg]C[This is big,  but you have let B get away with ignoring your moves near his weak gp  again: I think you should play as in the variation first.]

(;W[hk]C[should connect;  this is greedy.  You should question being pushed around of course:  but you look at the EXCHANGE  75, J4, and think who has gained more?   You should be delighted to make that powerful  wall.]

;B[mh];W[lh];B[hh];W[gg];B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[em]C[It is obviously  imperative to get 107 or 109 out, either above or below.  Alarm bells  might start now...]
;B[fk];W[fl]C[.. or definitely  now!]
(;B[eg]LB[el:a][gl:b][dj:c]C[This is an obvious good shot, but I think  that with A, B, C up your sleeve, for an extra eye, the best line  here is to make the group live.]
;W[fh]LB[gl:a][el:b][hj:c][kg:d]C[As the play  now progresses up to 119, you (B)  rescue 69 etc, but they are worth  little compared to 107, which severely dents the W moyo.

How about the obvious push and cut  at H13?

Also after A, B, C the B stones start to look very strong.

There is also the aji of 105.  The attempt to capture at N13 does not  work, but only just; so look for a duel purpose move, making the  capture work or something else: D.

Having said all this, I don't think any of it works! (after the 115,  116 exchange, which makes the B stones so much  weaker).]
