C["This game was very close. It was only 3.5 moku, not counting Komi. I really am not sure what went wrong. White invaded me and I wasn't sure what to do."

I,  My Name is David (Arcanus on KGS) and i will review your game. I hope this helps your game.]
;B[qp];W[dq];B[pc];W[dc]C[Q10 its not a bad move, it helps you to settle your territory and framework. To me this seems like a shusaku like fuseki (opening), i guess that atacking its a best move. (b,c or d)]

(;B[pj];W[dj]C[This isnt a bad move, but again, atacking will be a more interesting aproach.]
;B[oq];W[co]TR[de]C[Good move. Maybe D15 would do a better work.]

(;B[df];W[ce];B[ff];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[pf];W[gc]C[A interesting move.]
;B[jp];W[qm]C["I felt sure that White can't live, but he did."
Someone told a while a very good proverb for this case: 
"Its Not dead, until its dead". 
With that in mind, you should asume that it can:
a) escape
b)live

The tow options arent very good for you anyway, but there is a always a good side of the things. You should remember that te best way to build territory is putting pressure on weak enemy groups, just like you did.  
Try to attack always using your strong groups/formations as a wall, so your opponent will a have a very bad time. In this case R9 would be better. Lets see.]

(;B[pn];W[qk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj]C[You dont need to protect the cut YET.]

(;B[qh];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[so]C[Put pressure on te groups to get the sente (initiative)]

(;B[pl];W[ql];B[sp];W[rn];B[si]C[Good timing.];W[rk]C[The group its alive, i suggest that you redo some TsumeGo (problems of life and death). With a little practice you will recognize the shapes of living/dead formations.]
;B[sl];W[sm];B[lc];W[pk]C[You should remember that 1 stone isnt important when the game its at hand.
Besides you need more territory. P10 would do the work.]
(;B[ol]C[I thought I had to play here to avoid a cut later, but now White escapes and runs rampant.]
;W[ok];B[ml];W[nj];B[mi]C["Trying to surround from a distance, but it doesn't work."
You are right on your idea, but N11 its not the move(not for the moment). You STILL NEED more territory, so go for it!.]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[mj]
(;B[lh];W[lj];B[kl]C[Good.];W[ji]
(;B[ki]C[Not a good one. Yes you threathen white but at the end you will have to concede some of your stones for that (not a very good trade.]
;W[kj];B[jh];W[li];B[mh];W[kh];B[kg];W[ki];B[jg];W[je]C[This is a severe attack, you need to respond with the same intensity ;-). (There is a lot of follow up moves, i put only the ones that came to me right now)]

(;B[le];W[kd];B[ld];W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[mb]C[More solid. 
M18 its better.];W[jc];B[hg];W[hf];B[ig];W[if];B[jf];W[ie];B[gh]
C[G8 its a bigger move.];W[gi];B[hl];W[gl];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn]
;W[fn]C[Again... you need to do more solid moves like G5. in the endgame, it helps you a lot.]

(;B[ho];W[go];B[hn];W[gq];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[hp];B[nk];W[oj]
;B[gf];W[ge]C[Not necessary. G9 its better.]
(;B[gg];W[fe];B[ee];W[ed];B[dh];W[ch];B[ip];W[hq]C[Still G9 its a good move.]

(;B[em];W[fm];B[gk];W[fk];B[fo]C["Trying to cut and separate him. I end up losing a number of stones, but also making life in the lower right."
That its a good way to learn when to cut/not cut at your opponent. Trying its always the best thing (some say "cut first, think later"). But remember:
NEVER COUNT WITH THE MISTAKE OF YOUR OPPONENT. you need to think as a perfect player. In the end, the one who take advantage of the other side mistakes will win.]

The best form to improve its see pro games, i recomend you games of Lee Changho and Lee See Dol   (you only need to look at them, dont try to remember all the game, just observe the fights).]

Dont stress yourself with that kind of moves, it happens a lot, you just need to remember to push your enemy against your walls or strong groups.
R18 is the move.]

[aa]C[Well, that all, i hope it helps you.
Some tips:
a) remember always the objetives and principles of the game
b) dont let your rival take the pace of the game
c) Build strong framework on the early game, it will do a good wall after.
d) if you cant kill, try to minimize the loss pushing against a strong group or to the edge.
e) do some tsumego, it helps a lot (to everyone, not just you)
f) review and comment your games with other, sometimes when you look from outside you get new ideas.

A pleasure
