AB[dp][pd]C[Hi,

My name is Joachim and I will try to review your game grom both sides.]
;W[pp];B[dd]C[Cheng63 [23k?\]: hello good luck];W[pj]C[until now, solid start, all corners covered...]
;B[nq];W[pm]C[White: good defence. Attacking around k3 would have been very aggressive.]
;B[fc]C[Black: good move, securing the corner];W[ph]C[White: this is a bit small (two-point-jump) for this early stage of the game. R14 would be better (more agressive, preparing for R17 or K16.
Amother alternative is to attack on L3. Why L3? You can ask yourself: whis is the weakest or most isolated black store? O3, because it is furthest from the string D13 group.
Then attack the weakest spot. I use this line of thinking iin my openings, balancing defence (my fear) with attack (some healthy agression)]
;B[nc]C[Black: good defence against the white power on the right side, makeing the top string for black.]
;W[pf]C[White: Same as before, too small. Also attacking the Q16 stone is not a good idea, because it already has the O17 support. If you were thinking about enlarging your terretory, that is wroing for two reasons: (1) its too early to think about terretory, this comes as a side effect of attacking and (2) Q14 is too small. Better make some terretory elseswhere on the lowere edge or on the left side where there is still open space. You can also look at the board and see that the white stones are all on the right side, they are too concentrated. You risk getting the right side and loose the rest of the board.]
;B[nj]C[black: its too early to play in the center. Also, attacking the string white group is a bit too brave. Better secure the top with K16 or secure another corner with G3 (or similar) or one of the open sides with J3 or D10.]
;W[re]C[White: Not incorrect, but there are bigger fish to fry than this small defence. All points mentioned as possible plays for black in my comment to blacks previous move would be better moves for white. Look, how large the board is and how small the arear where ALL white stone are. That cannot be good for white.]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[qd]C[Whita and black: not incorrect attack / defence moves, bt too small, the board os still empty at the botton and on the left side. Both: even is you loose a few points of terretory by not responding in the top right corner, you gain about 3 times more by playing at the bottom, top or left side!]
;W[pe];B[nm]C[Black: Looks attractive to enclose white at the right side, but this move is too far away from the 3rd and 4th lines whish are much more powerful to build up positions.]
;W[np]C[white: nice attack, but still on the right side? Learn to step back an play in the empty open space (3rd and 4th line)]
;B[mp];W[op];B[no];W[oo];B[on];W[pn];B[om];W[mq];B[lq];W[mr]
;B[or]C[Here, white could have won the battle. See variation.]

(;W[oq];B[nr];W[pr];B[ms];W[lr]C[White: Bad idea to defend stones that are already lost]
;B[kr];W[ps];B[ls]C[At this point, the game is clearly lost for white. He has some 14x3=42 points on the right, black has the rest of the board, which is more than 300 points. Even if white manages to redice these 300 points to 200 or even 150, black still wins clearly. Once in a while, its a good idea to look at the board and think: do I prefer to be black or white? why? that can give you ideas to play better moves, that seem to come out of nowhere (for example white playing at D10 instead of at Q1. Q1 secures R1 = 1 point larger terretory. D10 secures about 10 points and redices black by about 20 points = it is a 30 times better move!]
;W[os];B[ns]C[soem comment for both oppenents: this is very small (=one point larger terretory) tharefore VERY bad moves, because the board is crying for very important moves, the ones I have piinted out earlier.]
;W[ol]
(;B[cn]C[Black: Yes! very good.];W[dj]C[White: Finally!];B[cj]
C[Black: no, don't attack. Better play D12 and strengthen the D15 corner while white struggles for life on the left side. You will also be able to play around E6 and strengthen the lower side. Then you have the top and the bottom and the game is yours. A big reward for allowing white to live a small life on the left side. dont; be greedy and try to completely kill white.]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[ci];B[bj]C[both: complicated moves. Not bad, but wrong strategy on black's side. White's strategy might be ok. The game is lost anyway, so go in for all or nothing.]
;W[bk];B[bi];W[ch];B[di];W[ej];B[eh];W[ek];B[dl];W[el];B[dm]
;W[bh]C[Black should have given up his three stones here and play C14 to strengthen and secure the corner.]
;B[ak];W[ai];B[aj];W[al]C[Well played from white.]
(;B[fk]C[Black: too aggressive. Now white lives on the left side and you will never succees in killing or even limiting white by direct contact. Better play with distance: H4 secures a HUGE section at the bottom, C14 enlags the corner.P15 seems small, but it is powerfull for the top side. See variation.]
;W[fj];B[gj]C[Black: you would have won the game by not trying to capture the white group. Do you see the connection at C10? Play G4 or K16 or C14 and win the game!]

C[This whole chain is a desaster for black. You might have seen this in a book somewhere, but it only works if white has NO liberty at the bottomm (around F12). Since white has not 1, but 4 liberties and a safe connction to the group on the left side, it is a very bad idea for black to play all the unsecure stones on the side of the white line. All of them can be easily attacked by white, as it happens in the next moves. The game was won for black before this desaster started 30 moves ago. Now, black has lost the game, because white can easily expand to the right and left of the chain.]

;W[na];B[nb];W[ja]C[White is very strong now. All of this is a result of the wrong attempt of black to capture the white chain that was impossible to catch.]
