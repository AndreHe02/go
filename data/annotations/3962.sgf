C[Mattias> Hi, my name is Mattias and I will do the review for you.
I will comment on your wrong plays and where you should play
instead of your wrong moves. I will look into your questions and
answer them as good as I can. If you wonder anything you can
contact me on KGS where I'm known as "Mattias".

damashi [21k\]: salut
Pimenta [22k\]: Hello
Pimenta [22k\]: Bonne chance

Pimenta: All in all, I think I won this game more because of White's mistakes than because of my good play. I feel White could have killed some groups that he didn't, at times when that would've been crucial to the outcame of the game.

I also made some gross mistakes, letting some groups die in the process, or letting my upper left corner be taken in seki. In some cases I immediately understood my mistakes, in others I still do not know how should I have satisfactorily played.

Thank you in advance for your time.];B[dq];W[oc];B[qp];W[ce]

C[Mattias> You answered this move by playing at D19. That is not
nessecary to live. I would have left it as it is and play a large move elsewhere. Especially this early in the game. See variation.]

(;B[da];W[ea];B[bb];W[fc]C[Mattias> You also got sente here.]
;B[cj]TR[kp][qd][op][pj]C[Mattias> This move does not threaten anything. This area is not 
of high interest for white cause black can jump out with his group
at B14 to B12. You should instead try playing around the marked spots.]

to ask yourself before every move.];W[em];B[dk];W[fo];B[go]
;W[dp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[cq];B[ai];W[bh];B[fn]C[Mattias> Do not play moves like this unless you do not have
anything bigger to play. The three dead stones can be usefull
later in the game. If nothing else this move could be used as a ko-threat.]

(;B[rh]C[Pimenta: When I think about this stone, I feel I haven't answered White's last stone adequately, He could've played around O8 and I think I would've lost considerably. How would you rate black O11 instead?

white stone at O10. Look att variations.];W[rg];B[rj];W[jj]

stone. A stone you might have use for later. White group
at O10 is strong and out in the open. White can attack
at R7. A good play for you is Q7 to secure the side.];W[nh]

eight stones in a row. Easiest way to make life is to come
upp a bit. Always depending on situation...];W[id];B[gb]C[Pimenta: H17?

damashi [21k\]: thx

Mattias> Good game. Thank you for sending your game to us.
Keep playing and you will keep improving and advance in the grades.

You play well. Just try to take a pause before you place a stone 
and think "What is the biggest move on the board right now?".
This is hard to see and that is why there are so many ranks i go.
But often we can improve our play by just asking ourself that question.

Good luck in the future!   :o)])
