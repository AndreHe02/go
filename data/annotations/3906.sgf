C[[Way*\] Hi, I'm WayFarer, 16k*, playing white.  My only general comment is that I do not know much joseki except for a few 3-3 invasions.

[Way*\] Thanx in advance for reviewing this game!

* Hi, I'm Geza Bohus, 8k EGF. I preceded my comments with *. Here are some general comments.

You both have a tendency to finish local fights before moving to somewhere else, even when there are bigger points on the board. If you can look at the board before each move in a static way, as if you just saw it for the first time, that will help a lot.

Try to make box-like moyos during fuseki. That way your stones work more efficiently.

I have made comments for both sides. Sometimes I have included variations with no comments - those are just might-have-beens. 

Let me know if you have any questions. Merry Xmas,

(;W[jd]C[[Way*\] I was debating between this move and R8.

* I probably would have moved to R8 or in that region, but this is OK I guess. Fuseki is hard 8-).]
;B[qn]C[* Again, I would have moved around K4 giving myself a nice big moyo. The right side is low.]
;W[jp]C[*good];B[mc];W[ci];B[ec];W[gc];B[dd]C[* A strange move. Attaching to a single stone just makes it stronger.]

(;W[de];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc]C[[Way*\] Bad?  Hane on top of 2?

* if you mean D16 on your B-C16, that couldn't be helped.

* otoh, black e15 seems much bigger to me, if for nothing else, because you will move there and close black in.]
;W[ee]C[*good]
(;B[fc]C[* Good for white. Black should have come out.];W[gd]
C[[Way*\] Bad?  Hane I wanted to build a moyo in the upper left with this move.

* This is good as it confines black to the corner.];B[gb];W[hb]
;B[fb]C[* Too small at this point. Black should have left this and if you do atari -- which you should only do much later -- he can stop you at E2 and you have to decide whether to take it or keep sente.

* Some big points on the board are E11 (building a nice moyo), G3 (taking territory and preventing black moving there, O6 (building moyo and pushing black back), M15 (similar reason)]

(;W[ic]C[[Way*\] Is this move necessary?  I thought I had to protect  the H18 stone, but I wasn't sure.  Maybe K18 would've been a better move to protect it?

* You did not need to move here as K16 is close enough. See variations.]
;B[ck]C[* This isn't too bad, even though it wasn't on my list 8-). I think P6 is bigger though, for instance.]
;W[fi]C[* Good.];B[ej];W[ei];B[dj]
(;W[bi]C[* not so important];B[gj]
(;W[gi];B[fj];W[gq]C[* Good, but H11 wouldn't have been bad either. Your moyo is more closed than black's.]
;B[fp];W[gp]C[[Way*\] In my self-review, I think N3 would've a better move here.  Not sure.  During the game, I was worried about the moyo on the lower left.

* This is fine and you were correct to worry.];B[mp]C[* This is much less important for black than one F5.]
;W[nr]C[*?];B[nq];W[oq];B[mr]C[* The last few moves were not very important for either of you while there are still huge moyos to settle.]
;W[fo]C[[Way*\] Is this a mistake?  I did not want to give up sente.  Or would the O4-N3-P2 sequence have been better for me?  That sequence would've solidified the corner for me and force black to either escape or attack my left white stones to make eye-space.

* This is very good for you. You are basically ruining black's moyo.]
;B[or]C[* Totally unimportant as I already mentioned when you played around G18.]
;W[pr];B[ns]C[* So now he lives and took about 4-6 points I guess, in gote. You on the other hand can ruin his bottom left moyo completely.]
;W[qc]C[* That's good too.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]
(;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[oe];W[ob];B[nb];W[pa]C[[Way*\] Got the corner in gote.

* Yes. See variation for the standard joseki.];B[oi]C[[Way*\] At this point, I was really worried about the area around R8.  I did not know how I was supposed to deal with that.  Q8 or R8?  I was afraid Black would be able to capture my stone if I went around there, or that he would at least chase it and, in doing so, expand his upper right moyo.  For the moment, I went with what I hoped to be sente moves.

* And you were right to worry, black's moyo on the right is huge.]
;W[ep];B[dp];W[do];B[co];W[pm]C[[Way*\] As mentioned earlier, I didn't know what to do here.  As a result, I decided upon a shoulder hit and giving him territory under the third line.  This way, I'd at least remove any moyo that he would have.

* Some of it, certainly.];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[pj];B[pi];W[qk]
;B[rk];W[qj]C[* Bad: not much point to this and bad shape. After black S10 which was certain, you have an empty triangle surrounded. You can also keep it as a ko threat for instance.]
;B[rj];W[pn]C[[Way*\] Gote.  Bad for me?

* Not bad, because you are closing black in.]
(;B[qo];W[po]C[* You are in good shape again.];B[rp];W[qq];B[rq]
;W[rr]C[* Way too small. M3, N7, P10, J11 are much much bigger.]
;B[oj]C[* See? I told you 8-).];W[pk];B[lh]C[* Big.];W[mf]C[[Way*\] Overplay?  I think black can cut off this stone.

* Might be. Let's see.];B[ng];W[nf];B[of];W[kg];B[ih]C[[Way*\] I don't think I handled the next set of moves very well.

* This is a problem. Let's see what happens.];W[gg]C[* OK so far. Could be H13 I guess.]
;B[jg];W[jf];B[if];W[je];B[kh];W[mg];B[lg]
(;W[lf];B[mh];W[jr]C[[Way*\] Would E3 have been bigger?

* No, it isn't. This is fine. Could be at L2 or M3 as well, the latter leading to a fight perhaps.]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[dn];W[eo];B[nn];W[no];B[mo]
(;W[nl]C[* A cut at N6 could have worked. See vars.];B[kq];W[jq]
;B[kr];W[hg]C[* No point in making idle threats just because they're sente. These can be useful in a ko fight.]
;B[ig];W[fm]C[[Way*\] I was expecting he would respond with E7.

* Yes, that would have been natural.];B[he]C[* I don't think this is such a big threat.]
;W[ge];B[hd];W[hc]C[* I don't think this is too important. The cut at N6 is still there.]
;B[ke];W[kf];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[dl]C[[Way*\] At this point, I noticed the gote sequence at M17.  I decided against it b/c I wanted to retain sente.]
;B[cl];W[sq];B[so];W[se];B[rf];W[im]C[[Way*\] I did not continue at T14 b/c I don't think that would've left me at gote.  Not sure.

[Way*\] I felt I was losing... badly.  So I tried to solidify territory.  I saw a gote sequence at M17, but I felt this was bigger.

* It certainly is.];B[en];W[fn];B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[fl];B[ek]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[ba];W[ji];B[jh];W[er];B[dr];W[fr]C[* Small and gote.]
;B[bp]C[[Way*\] Mistake on Black's?  That wasn't necessary, was it?

* Not at all necessary. A simple ladder would catch a cutting stone. You got lucky here.]

;B[ik];W[il];B[hl];W[hm];B[gl];W[gm];B[fk];W[ii];B[hi];W[hk]
C[[Way*\] Is this move small?  I wasn't sure if there was a bigger move at this point.  Or at least another move that is sente.

* This is probably ok, but black has come in through M7 and for some strange reason stopped.

* Furthermore, this is sente but so is black's answer, so your sente is lost.]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[kl];W[jl];B[io]C[* -1 point for black if you don't answer.]

(;W[in]C[* No need.];B[ir];W[js];B[ks];W[ip];B[ok];W[ol]C[[Way*\] I think this was a mistake.  N10 would've better, I think.  He must respond, or else I can go to O12 and connect out.

* Would have been bigger even if he connects O12.];B[mj];W[hf]
;B[ie];W[nk];B[nj];W[nd]C[[Way*\] I read out the next sequence of moves.  I wanted to be able to play T14 in sente.  Not sure if this would've given me more points, but I thought it would be fun to try out.]
