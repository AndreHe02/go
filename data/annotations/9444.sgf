C[F: Taking a look at this match in general, I see that you have a very agressive way of playing, and it is good. You are always looking for a way to attack, and I think that this way you will end being a strong player. 

But you get involved in complex fights in wich you have to stop and calculate carefully. Some people, (like me. Im very lazy) have a more strategic way of playing and play by intuition, not stoping too much in calculation. But your way of playing really NEED to think carefully. Because one mistake in such fights makes you loose the game. 

I highly recomend you to learn tesuji, and to take your time to read positions carefully.

Your big mistake is that you have too many weak groups at the same time on the board, and they can be easily attacked]

(;W[lg];B[mh];W[lh];B[mi];W[kj]C[F: You are pushing black group but he is in the seventh line, so he is making a big moyo and your influence has two cut points, and so open, so it is not so thick and is easy to invade]
;B[lf];W[me];B[kf];W[jd];B[fd];W[li];B[mj];W[if];B[eb]C[F: You have D17 in danger, and also K16 and J14, and still you tenuki. Even L10 is not too strong. If you like to attack, first you have to make your groups strong.]

(;W[po];B[pm];W[no];B[nq];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[nm]C[F Now you have four weak groups. This is bad]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[ml]TR[lk]C[F: And still another stone not linked to others. Too many groups black can attack. M9 is good shape for him. Anyway Q7 is weak too, so I cant really say this is a bad move, but you have to be careful about L14 group because if it scape and R7 link to N10 you have lost. You get involved into a very complicated way, so think carefully]
;B[nl];W[mk];B[nk];W[mm];B[jg];W[ig];B[jh];W[hi];B[jj]C[F: Finally he scapes. It was difficult to tell it, me myself thought he couldnt. But you react in the ccorrecto way. You chase him and take influence In the end you kill, but you cant assure it now. Butthe influence is something you have for sure]

[nj][rm]C[F: The variations here are hard to study, but it seems you have the posibility of s7 and the cutting point of o10, so your success is not only a question of luck. R9 is a very good try. You have nothing to loose anyway

C13 is another very big point. I would have played it first, because it seems that if you take territory in that side, you have won, and is something more easy than what youÂ´re trying]

(;W[gg]C[F: It seems little to me. Your up group is alive since n18 is dead. H13 can link to both groups, so you may only fear the cut at H9, G10. And G13 is not the solution]

(;W[hh]C[F: Now you are alive and strong. You have territory in the center and top, and influence. Right is very open so you can still invade. You can attack being secure]

(;W[lf]C[F: I would have played this instead, so my position is more secure while I map some influence to later have territory, and I would have let the attack for later]
