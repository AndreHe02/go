C[I am Chris Dams and I will be your reviewer today.

The most noticable thing of this game is that Black plays much better than White, so I do not really have any advice for Black. White should learn more about the basic moves like extensions, approaches and so on. A book on fuseki might really help. For instance "In the Beginning". I hear that the book by Otake is also good, but I have never read that myself. Also, in this game I will be pointing out many errors by White that are of the kind that these books should help with.]

C[This is not good. Black can take the corner by C4 and obtains a stable group. If White plays on C4, he takes the corner and the lone black stone is under a bit of pressure.]
;B[cp];W[dr]C[This looks like and endgame-type move. It is way too soon to start the endgame. This kind of move can be useful in the opening if it actually makes life more difficult for a black group, but the two stones of Black there are easily defended, any White still does not have a base. It is better for White to make a base by playing, say,  L4.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[cr];W[er]C[Protecting just one stone is not important in the opening. It might be important if it had any bearing on the stability of groups, but as it stands it does not, so it a useless move. Extending around L4 is still much better.]
;B[iq]C[The exchange after White D2 is a great success for Black. The black group became very stable, the White wall did not get an extension and no longer has a good extension.]
;W[mc]C[Normally one would approach from the more open side. That would mean R14 here. The reason that the more open side is better, is that on the more open side you can make more territory. Besides, this stone can easily get attacked because it does not have much space.]
;B[oc]C[Yes, very easy dual-purpose move by Black. This both helps his corner and puts pressure on the lone white stone.]
;W[me];B[pf];W[pj]C[If you want to do something about this side, R9 would be more logical. From R9 you can extend to either R12 and R6. Since Black can only do one move at a time, you are certain to get one of these two. A two-space extension on the third line is a standard thing to do in an area that is under influence of the opponent. The nice thing about it is that unless the are many opponent stones in the neighbourhood, the connection cannot be broken. Another move to think about would be R6 but it has the disadvantage that Black can do a dual purpose by, for instance, playing R10. This would both extend from his position in the top-right and put pressure on your stone. But it is already difficult to come up with good moves for White.]
;B[lq];W[hq]C[I understand that you want to make sure that the white wall is not going to get into trouble. However, this way of doing it is painfull for White. In the exchange that follows, White only makes a miniscule amount of territory while Black strengthens the lower side. This does much more for Black than it does for White. If you want to do something with the wall, play H5 and later you may either connect it to some other white stones or make a bit of territory in the center.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[pl]C[Yes, very logical move. This helps the area below  and at the same time puts pressure on the lone White stone. This stone does not have the room to make a good extenstion to the top. Besides, there is already another not-so-strong white group (N17 and N15) in the neighbourhood. White is headed for lots of trouble.]
;W[qh];B[qk];W[qj];B[qg];W[ph];B[nl];W[nj]C[More or less connecting the weak white groups by playing O13 would make more sense. Also, playing on R3 would be very useful. Black only needs to close the corner with R4 to be more or less certain about lots of territory in the area. Black ultimately does this, but could have done so much earlier.]
;B[jl];W[jj];B[ie]C[I think D18 is better for Black because that does more to create stable territory. This moves looks a bit aimless. On the other hand, the moves by White that follow are even more aimless and because of that the white stones in the top-right get into big trouble.]
;W[ig]C[It appears that you want to make some territory in the right half of the center. However, the prospective territory is full of holes. Therefore it is better to play O13 to more or less close the most important hole.]
;B[jf];W[jg];B[kf];W[kg];B[lf];W[mf];B[lg]C[Having Black walk into your territory like this is very painful. It makes the moves on K13 and L13 rather useless.]
;W[mh];B[mg]C[This really hurts the three stones above this one. It is doubtful whether they can live. And if they somehow manage to do so, Black can ravage the territory that you are trying to make in the left center. The double attack between two not-so-strong groups is working beautifully for Black.]

;W[ja];B[ia];W[ka];B[db];W[cc];B[kd];W[jc];B[ib];W[oa]C[This looks more like a misclick then anything else. White is dead there and really should play on R3 if he wants to stand any change of making anything of this game. Resigning would be the most skillful move.]
;B[cb]C[This is not that big compared to R4, which would secure a lot of territory.]
;W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[ed]C[Bad move. In the pushing that follows, White gets more territory than Black. Black should ignore this area and hope to do something more useful there later. If he really wants to play in the area, C8 is a nice move, but, really, R4 is so much bigger.]
