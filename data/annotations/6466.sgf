AB[pd][dp]C[Feels like opening loses game for b. I often struggle by allowing one of my groups to become weak. Wondering where in this game b got behind. Left some comments along the way. Thank you in advance.


[Mathieu\] Hello, I'm Eranorn on KGS and I will comment your game. My comments will be marked as here.
Enjoy !];W[pp];B[dc];W[ce];B[cd]C[[Mathieu\] C16 is better when black has a stone around D10. Here it isn't bad, but probably a bit slow... And White is happy to reinforce his stone by playing D15.]
;W[de];B[gc]C[F17 or G17 normal here?

[Mathieu\] I think F17 would be ok, but I would prefer F16, regarding the black stone on the upper right.
You can do someting with that wide extension, like setting your own stones (see var.)]

(;W[dh]LB[ci:B][di:A]C[[Mathieu\] This a bad move... You just take the shape Black wanted to give you !
In fact, if you had just D15 and D12, Black would play C16 to take the corner in sente and make you heavy !
Remember : "From a wall of two stones, make a three space extension"
You should play at either A or B.];B[qn];W[cn]C[[Mathieu\] Here you can see that it would have been really better to have the D12 stone one space further... C6 is really far from its allies !]
;B[nq];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[pq]
(;B[jq]C[Is this sequance normal for b? Seems to leave R6 stone alone.

[Mathieu\] It isn't the joseki sequence... See var.]
(;W[ql]LB[pl:B][pm:A][oo:D][po:E][op:C]C[Not sure on best way to play from here.

[Mathieu\] I don't know exactly what is best but R8 is to low I think, Black can play at A if he wants and escape (see var.). I would prefer to play at A or B (probably B), but you must be careful of the sequence Black C, White D, Black E that can occur later.]
;B[rp];W[rq];B[pm]C[[Mathieu\] Was the A I mentionned earlier.]
;W[pl];B[om];W[mm]
(;B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[pi]C[[Mathieu\] Good ! Here it is better to extend just two spaces because I you just follow the rule, as black is strong in this region, you can get in trouble.]
;B[qp]C[[Mathieu\] Be careful...];W[qq]
(;B[po];W[ro];B[rn];W[mo]LB[op:A]C[Ways to improve this sequence?

[Mathieu\] Yes, just here you should play A instead of N5 because else the corner is dead... (see previous var. for other ways)]
;B[lp];W[qf]LB[op:A]C[[Mathieu\] A still very important.];B[nc]
;W[eo]LB[ep:A]C[This move feels akward. Not sure how to respond as b.

[Mathieu\] Well... I would say, why not ? If I was black, I would play at A, simply trying to take profit on the bottom, and not worrying about white's moyo on the left that can be reduced because the white's stones are too far from their allies.]
;B[fq]C[[Mathieu\] Too submissive.];W[cq]LB[eo:A]C[[Mathieu\] Not consistent with white marked stone. If you play A, you want to make a moyo on the left side. I fyou invade, you will take profit but black will become thick and can reduce and invade your moyo. You have to choose a strategy and stay coherent with it.]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er]C[Tenuki here? Seems top is big right now.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[fp]LB[dk:A]TR[cn][eo]C[[Mathieu\] Now, Black can pincer the two marked white stones around A.]
;W[lc]C[Pincer here leaves up right corner weak, not sure how to approach this stone.

[Mathieu\] (See var.)]
(;B[re]C[Feels akward.];W[pb]LB[md:A]C[[Mathieu\] You can still play at A (See var.)]

(;B[qc];W[nb];B[oc];W[ob];B[qb];W[ic];B[he]LB[dk:A][op:B]C[[Mathieu\] Hummm... The purpose of this stone isn't clear. Better to take your sente to play elsewhere around A perhaps (B's still here !)]
;W[ck]C[H15 feels wrong now.];B[mc];W[mb];B[ph]LB[qi:A]C[How best to invade here?

[Mathieu\] Hard to tell... Perhaps A is a good opportunity too but this don"t seem bad to me.
Remember that this invasion could be dangerous for the black s6 group. It isn't alive yet !! (as long as you haven't play P4)]
;W[oh];B[oi]C[Seems now Q13 or R12 was better?

[Mathieu\] For black ? This can be good, but Q 13 seems really better than R12.]
;W[og];B[pj];W[qi];B[oj];W[qj];B[rg];W[qe]
(;B[qd]C[S16 better?

[Mathieu\] No !!  (See var.)];W[rf]
(;B[rd]C[[Mathieu\] No need to be afraid (see var.)];W[se];B[mf]
LB[ld:A]C[This move seems to work well, but not exactly sure how to use it best.

[Mathieu\] If you want to go out, better to force at A];W[mh]
;B[so]LB[op:A]C[Too early for this stone?

[Mathieu\] Probably makes your group alive...
But If you want to do so, you always miss A !];W[rm];B[oo]C[[Mathieu\] It hurts !]
;W[gd]C[[Mathieu\] White really too nice !]
(;B[hc];W[hd]C[Feels wrong for b.

[Mathieu\] Perhaps better to play H16 as black (see var.)];B[fd]
;W[id];B[ib];W[jb];B[hb]LB[ld:A]C[[Mathieu\] ost the forcing move at A.]
;W[kc];B[of];W[pf];B[oe];W[fe]C[b now becoming desparate to enter left side.]
;B[ed];W[kf]LB[ee:A]C[[Mathieu\] Black can enter at A (see var.)]

[Mathieu\] Since your group on the top is alive, S1 is better !
But in fact, you shouldn't have played the ko on the top, you should have provoked this one and won it !]
