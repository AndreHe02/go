C[Dear reviewer,

I was white in this game and tried my best not to make unnecessary moves.

Yet, after having felt quite in control during the whole game, and even wondering why my opponent showed such a lack of spirit, I was bewildered by my final win by only 3.5 points. I do not think I have lost a lot during endgame so I must have made some major mistake during fuseki or middle game, even though I thought hard on my moves (as much as the 20 sec byo-yomi let me, I admit). I have left several comments on the moves that I think may be bad.

Thanks for your help in getting better at this !

Mark - When looking for the biggest moves, think "Which groups are the weakest?" The black group on the left can still be attacked, so i think you should start there. See variations for ideas.]

(;W[eh]C[I think this is the first of the move which enabled black to come this close, ny plan was to extend my upper left territory by attacking this group, but it may have been a mistake since the outcome was bad, or did I mess up during the follow-up ?

Any idea, or thoughts about the alternatives I propose ?

Mark - I think your variations are correct in what you should do. The key here is to make sure you cannot be cut.]

This is not a bad move, you are werll connected, and are in a good position to destry black's influence. However, you should be careful about the lower left corner, as white is still small.]

Mark - Good game in general. I think the score was very close because omf some endgame mistakes, but you can get stronger but studying endgame moves.

When thinking about big moves, think "where am I weakest? Where is the opponent weakest?" then you will have a better idea of where to play.

I hope my review was helpful to you, enjoy!
