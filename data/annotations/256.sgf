(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[I have added some comments where I thoug
ht it was necessary preceeded with "magnus:" mostly.
The difference in strength between 8k* and 1k* is perhaps not as  large as it should be on IGS, so I did not find so many errors or/else was  the situation so complicated that I could not suggest anyth
ing better.

would give white corner eyes and r8 still have activity..

magnus: If Black play 'b' white can choose to play s4 and Black has  to play 'a' anyway.
Worse still is that white might try to play 'a' and complicate  things. I think 'a' is the proper move playing 'b' might be just as good at  'a' but is probably even worse.]

;B[gq];W[jn]L[fl][hj][gl][fn][en]C[
is A better?

magnus: Difficult. White may answer with 'c' and then Black play 'd'  probably followed by White 'e' this is a mess but it is White who take the  risk in that case. If the variation is followed this is
 good for Black I think.]

;W[im]L[fn][gl]C[magnus: This is perhaps  another good way for white to fight, but Black can try black 'a' and  if Black get away with the groups White might lose much on the left side in  the process. I think it is wiser and good enough for W
hite to play  'b'.];B[gl];W[hk];B[gk];W[ik];B[gm];W[gj]C[magnus: It look like White play unreasonable but Black has to play  well to survive.]

magnus: Black can also play the tesuji Black 'c' (also very easy to  overlook). White is forced to capture with 'b' and Black play atari with 'c'.  Now White has no choice but to play White 'e' but Bla
ck captures and start a huge ko. Since Black have two dead groups the  amount of kothreats should be in Blacks favour. If Black wins the ko it would  be very profitable.]

 irrelevant? then where?

magnus: White have ~90 secure points and Black have ~45.
This mean that Black has turn the entire moyo into territory to win  and not let White gain anything or perhaps kill the only weak group on the  board. This look difficult for Black.
Perhaps this is the only possible move hoping that White will make a  mistake in judgement now.]
