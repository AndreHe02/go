C[dutchi [4k\]: hey gg :)
TooSexy [4k\]: have fun!

About ten months ago as a 7k I offered a teaching game in the beginner room at KGS.  A 25k took up the challenge and won a close 9 stone game. I was impressed by his play and liked his attitude.  When he told me his goal was to become shodan in one year I offered to help him get to 10k or so quickly.

He improved within a few weeks to around 10k.  Now dutchi is a strong 4k.  Here he is as black taking his former teacher to school for the first time!

I don't have specific questions on the game. any insights would be appreciated.

Thanks
Toosexy (Bill)

Jay: We will enjoy your game together. I will comment on both sides.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[fq];W[jp]C[Jay: This pincer is rarely seen. It's best played with some W's stone in the LR corner, as moyo building.]
;B[cq]C[Jay: I feel that B's this move is premature.  There are lots of good points on board now, with two empty corners. Playing this joseki made W K4 stone in an excellent position.]

[cm:A][fr:C]C[Jay: W's this move is off mark. It's not doing any thing. W should either play F4 or D6.]

(;B[cm]C[Jay: This B move is not needed, too slow. B should take one of the empty corner. W's previous move was not correct, since it did not pressure the B corner group.  See variation.]

(;W[gp]C[Jay: W's this move is safe, but too slow. Just look at the number of stones needed to capture the single B stone at F6, it is very inefficient. Even if W omit this move, B will not be able to do much here.]
