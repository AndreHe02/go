(;B[dc]C[white attached, which makes that area very urgent --- white's move is not good, but you should punish by answering locally (see variation)]
;W[qf];B[mc];W[pj];B[cf]TR[dc][dd]C[this is very slow, becuase black is already strong (so you're playing too close to your own 2 stones. Again, you should continue in the lower right corner.]
;W[gp];B[pn]LB[oq:A][qq:B]C[good, you play in the right part of the board. But generally, when white attach to your stone, the strongest move is hane, so either A or B (because that puts maximum pressure on their stone, since you remove one more liberty).]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[cq];B[cp]LB[oq:A]C[this seems weird --- your're asking for a fight in the area where your opponent is strong. I'd rather just play A to settle that area.]

TR[dn][eo]C[bad shape --- white is already connected, this area of the board is not interesting. A and B are big points.]

;W[gn];B[ho];W[fk]TR[dm]C[white captures on a large scale, so the marked stone was clearly a bad move]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[fm];W[gm];B[gk]C[oh, surprise ending. 

white should of course continue to fight, see continuation]

;B[al];W[em]LB[bi:A]C[white is safe. Black can save some stones at A, but this move is gote and not big enough, so at the moment you should play elsewhere (see continuation)]
