AB[pd][dp]C[I cheked some variations in the endgame and, had black saved his group, the game would've been very tight. But, had black protected better against my invasion in the first place, I think I wouldn't have had a chance to win. I.e., I won because of my opponent's consecutive mistakes. I'd like to know how my game could've developed better without his mistakes.

Hi, I'm Sisyph on KGS, and I will be your reviewer for this game. Keep in mind that I'm a KGS 5kyu player, take my comments accordingly. In any case, I hope they will be useful for you. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me ^^

My comment will be under some dashes. If I use some (un)common Japanese Go terms, I will try to give an explanation at the end of my comment. If you know them you can skip that part ...

Let's Go ^^

[ps:2][qs:5][rs:8][ss:11]TR[qp]C[As a friend told me, it's better to secure a corner before atacking. Although this looks a bit too small.

---
Well making a shimari* is big. here you make about 11 "sure" points.

Your opponent has no points, so from a territorial point of view, you lead ^^ 
Of course his potential is far greater than yours.

 It is a matter of style to play such territorial move or something else. One can argue that in a handicap game White should play more agressive moves. But in fact, in 2 or 3 stones handicap games, I've heard that you should just play as usual. Your theorically better skill will make the difference. So if you like territorial style, I think it's OK. If you prefer to play faster, begin with a hoshi* and make a kakari*. Usual kakari are at A and B to work well with your (only) corner. With your initial komoku* (triangle), B is better (see variation). Of course there is many other possibilities, that's why Go is interesting !


*shimari: corner enclosure.
*hoshi: star point, 4-4 point in the corner
*kakari: approach move, usually in the corner
*komoku: corner 3-4 point];B[cq]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[---
Too slow. Black is losing ground ^^
Probably better around Q10 or R10 to deny you the shimari extension.]
;W[qj]TR[qp][oq]C[---
Perfect extension from your shimari (triangles).];B[qh]LB[qf:A]
[qg:B]C[Extension from a corner enclosure

---
Well, a bit loose as it does not protect the corner. Probably meant to attack your stone. A or B are better as corner enclosure. This move is a bit far from the corner and does not really attack your stone...]
;W[cf]C[I attacked here so that he wouldn't get too strong in this side
---
Seems ok to me. 

As I said, previous Black move does not really attack your stone, so you can  tenuki*


*tenuki: play elswhere];B[cj]LB[ci:A]C[this makes it look like the lower left is black's. Normally, I wouldn't try to attack it.

---
This move is a pincer and has two purposes:

- It denies you the perfect extension at A (extends n+1 intersections from a n stones wall)
- it begins to build a moyo*

So it is a good move. But you should not consider that the lower left is black territory. It is Black zone of influence, but you can reduce its size and even invade it.

It is a common mistake to see a zone of influence as territory. But you have to be cautious. You do not want Black to make it real territory. So you have to try to not reinforce Black stones.


*moyo: framework, zone of influence]
(;W[cd]C[---
This contact play is usually played defensively when you are badly outnumbered, which is not the case ! As Black pincered you from a distance, you are 1 vs 1 and it is your turn !

;B[ed]
(;W[bi]LB[bd:A]C[Trying to secure a base

---
It is a good idea, but this not the best move:

- it is usually bad to play under a stone like this (see variation on the next move)
- Black can play A which is painful.
- it is usually better to escape first to the center before stabilizing. If Black shuts you in, He will get massive influence !
- when fighting try to get good shape. Here A seems to give you good shape (see variation)]

;B[eg]
(;W[bd]C[Right, now this IS an overplay. I should've gone to the center first

---
Well, an overplay usually means a move that try too much. If your opponent answer correctly (punish you) you are at a loss. I think that in this case you mean "overconcentrated", a move that is not necessary. I'm not sure as Black has some nasty moves. It seems that this move is needed ! And now it is hard if not impossible to break out to the center ...

See variations.];B[ee]LB[jc:A][jp:B]C[---
Bad move. Black should use sente to get some big point, around A, B for example]
;W[ef]LB[nc:A][oj:B][jp:C]C[---
Bad move. You better play elsewhere and use sente to get the big points on the board. A, B or C are possible.]
;B[ff];W[df];B[fh]TR[ef][ff]C[---
Slow and overconcentrated. white can not cut and if he does, he cuts two strong groups that can live quite easily ^^

;W[nc]TR[cc][dd][ed][ee][ff][eg][dh][fh][ci][bj][cj]C[Again, atacking before my opponent gets stronger.

---
Yes ! Very good !

Black has a very strong wall. You have to play far from it. And if you manage to get a strong group to face Black wall, all his strength will go to waste ^^]
;B[oc]LB[jd:A]TR[qh]C[---
I think this is bad :

- This play is usually good if Black has a stone around A. 
- Because the triangled stone is too far, this does not efficiently protect the corner.
- If Black protect the corner, you will get a group facing his wall, wasting his strength !]
;W[nd]C[---
Good];B[of]LB[pe:A]C[---

Better at A or B. Black should exploit your mistake ^^]
(;W[nf]LB[ic:A]TR[kd]C[Going to the center

---
I'm not sure. You probably should stabilize while destroying Black territory by playing around A. If Black play there, he will get too much territory !

Your contact move is not the best one. It will strengthen Black, plus it is your triangle stone that need reinforcement !

See variation for some ideas ...]
(;B[nh]C[---
Too kind ^^
It is bad direction. Black should attack you from the left, making territory ! 
And you should do the opposite ^^];W[oi]LB[ic:A]C[Trying to take my group to the center.

(;W[oe]LB[ic:A][qc:B]C[I planned to threat to disconnect the corner from the side group. I knew it wouldn't work, but at least it helped me to assure my groups stay conected

---
Well, the problem is that you strengthen Black, forcing him to make sure territory ! 
If you play A, you stabilize your group without strengthening Black. You can invade at B later ... 
Now, after Black next move the invasion at B is not really possible !]

See how you have totally destroyed Black territory while gaining some for yourself !
This is ENORMOUS !!!

The ploblem is that Black has got a lot of territory too on the right.

It is time to make a plan to win the game. 

First : counting !
You should just count sure territory. Here we have something roughly like (circled points) :
Black : 26 + 4 = 30
White : 12 + 7 + 13 = 32
The count is approximative so we can say that considering points, the game is even.
If you look at the size of moyos* (squares) they are comparable, but Black has more influence (triangles). His potential is bigger, but you have sente*
The lower size around A is open.

You have to use sente* wisely to win the game ^^]
(;W[od]LB[jp:A]C[Was this necesary?
---
Well Black can do some nasty thing using the weaknesses you left ... But you can probably survive now, so you can play A or something else i order to win the game.]

[lq:E]TR[ji]C[As I saw I was blocked from going to the corner, I extended to this side, where I still had some room. By this point, I started to feel overwhelmed by black's thickness and influence in the center. From my point of view, we're pretty even on points on the top, but given black's wall and my non-existing influence in the center, it seems black would get an enormous moyo in the center.

---
Yes the Black triangle stone is a great add to Black influence. Your move is not bad, but considering Black influence, it should have been on the fourth line., at A or the like.

With your move, Black can play a boshi* at B, and get a very big moyo* ...
D, C, E are also possible I think.

boshi* : capping move];B[jl]LB[jo:A]C[---
Probably too small, A is better. When you build a moyo, build it the biggest possible !]
;W[ii]LB[jh:A]C[Too far... right?

---
Well, I can't see what your strategy is?
You need one to win ^^

And locally, your move do not work, because A is a double threat. 
Even if it works, a contact move will stengthen Black...];B[jh]
;W[jg];B[ih];W[lj]C[Right, now this wasn't very clever. Again, too far away from white support and too deep into black's thickness.

---
Yes. "Play away from thickness".

;B[jn]C[This seems like a black overplay that allowed me to go on with the next sequence

Well I hope my comments were useful to you. Some advices :

- avoid bad shape. I showed you two very basic and very bad. Avoid them and punish your opponent when he makes one.
- play away from thickness. You were lucky Black does not know how to use his thickness to wreck you apprt when you play too close ^^
- Moyo (zone of influence) is not territory. You can reduce a moyo, invade a moyo depending on the balance of territory. Why you must not do is make an unplanned attack that strenghten your opponet and/or transform his moyo in territory
- avoid being shut in, especially in the early stage of the game !
- continue to play and enjoy Go !]
