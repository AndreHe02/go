;B[pd]C[Hi, 

I'll be reviewing the game. I have provided quite a few detailed comments. They are mostly tactical, mainly because I am tactically much stronger than strategically. I hope you will find my comments of use.

catch22];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq];B[cn];W[fp];B[gq]C[sm1983: This move seemed strange to me, but I didn't know how to deal with it.

catch22: I find this move strange as well, but I think you dealt with it fine.]
;W[gp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[hr]
;W[ck];B[dm];W[ek];B[fm]
(;W[hn]C[catch22: This is not a good move. It tries to do two things at once (attacking the Black group, and protecting the cut at H4). However, it does neither very well. Attaching at H7, as happens in the game, just helps Black get good shape. Furthermore, the cut is still there.

See the variation for a better way of playing.];B[hm];W[im]
;B[hl];W[jn];B[iq];W[hp];B[fk];W[el]C[catch22: This is too brute force. Better patiently retreat at E10 and leave this as a threat.]
;B[em];W[fl];B[gl];W[gk];B[fj]MA[ek][el][fl]C[catch22: The problem with the last few moves is that the three marked stones have ended up short of liberties.]
;W[ej];B[hj];W[gj]C[catch22: Don't play this move unless you are going to follow it through.]
;B[fi];W[ei]MA[fi][gj]C[catch22: Shortage of liberties is indeed still a problem for White. However, if you are going to play here anyway, you should do so directly, and not first play G10...]
;B[gi]MA[fi][gj]C[...  The exchange of the marked stones has only helped Black.]

(;W[gr]C[catch22: Better play at J2 directly. See variation.]
;B[fr];W[ir];B[gs];W[jq]C[catch22: The drawback compared to the variation is that Black has much better eyeshape. As a result, B2 is not sente anymore for White.]
;B[dg];W[eh];B[ip]C[catch22: This does not work, so Black should not have played here.]
;W[io];B[jp];W[kp];B[ch]C[catch22: It would have been better for Black to play E14. It gets the black stone out in the open and keeps White split.]
;W[eg];B[cd];W[ce];B[de];W[df];B[ee];W[cg];B[dh]
(;W[cf]C[catch22: This move is too slow. Better play at E14 instead. See variation.]
;B[dc]C[catch22: Black got a good result here. The amount of points that White got in return for the twelve stones played at the left is limited, whereas the black stones are working efficiently.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[kc];B[ed]
(;W[nq]C[catch22: This is bad. It is way too close to White's strength and therefore very inefficient. White should not try to get territory here. It is much better to approach from the other side. See variation.]
;B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[qk];B[pc];W[rn]C[sm:1983: On reflection this move may have been a little too far in]
;B[rp];W[qh];B[rl];W[ql];B[rm];W[qm];B[rk]C[c]
(;W[rj]C[catch22: I would have been very tempted to play at R6 instead.]
;B[qn];W[sk];B[sn];W[sl]C[catch22: Better leave this move unplayed for now. Keep it as a ko threat. Black is not going to play here himself anyway.]
;B[ro];W[rg];B[rf];W[oh];B[ef];W[bh];B[bi];W[ci];B[ic];W[ke]
;B[ph]C[catch22: This move is a bit strange. It just helps White to strengthen his group.]

(;W[pg]C[catch22: Simply playing Q11 is good enough. See variation.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[oj];W[pj];B[oi];W[ok];B[mj]
(;W[ng]MA[oh]C[catch22: This is not good. The marked stone is not important. White should prevent the cut instead. See variation.]
;B[qg];W[rh];B[nk];W[ni];B[nj];W[ol];B[of];W[og]
(;B[pf]C[catch22: White has been let of the hook. If Black had instead played at O14, White would struggle. See variaion.]
;W[nf];B[mi];W[mh];B[mm];W[nl];B[ml];W[gc]C[catch22: This is an overplay. Black is too strong for White to invade.]

(;B[ie];W[ib];B[hb];W[hc];B[jb];W[jc]C[catch22: This does not work. Black can simply respond with J16. White should therefore play there himself.]
;B[ia]C[catch22: Big mistake by Black. He should have played J16 instead and White would have no good continuation.]
;W[id];B[jd];W[ib];B[jr];W[jo];B[ic];W[hd];B[gb];W[ib];B[pk]
;W[pl];B[ic];W[je];B[fc];W[ib];B[if];W[kb];B[ic];W[ik]C[sm1983: At this point, for some reason, I persist in wasting ko threats

catch22: Well, I don't think that is quite true. Although there may be bigger moves, winning the ko is still quite big. If Black connects at J18 instead, he gains about ten points at the edge (it saves J17 and K18, forces White to take K16, gives a sente endgame move at L19, means Black does not have to play F18 and H19), and also means that Black can squeeze the four white stones.]
;B[hk];W[ib];B[bg];W[di];B[ic];W[gn];B[gm];W[ib];B[il];W[ja]
;B[fa];W[ha]C[catch22: This is a very small move. Two points in gote. Here White definitely should have played elsewhere.]
;B[jm];W[in]C[catch22: Connecting here is small as well. The stone at J7 is not important and can be sacrificed. If you respond at all, do so at L7 instead.]
;B[jl];W[kh];B[is];W[kr];B[iq];W[ip]C[catch22: Another small move. There is no need to respond. Better take sente to play a big move (such as P18) instead.]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[aq];W[ap];B[bs];W[ir]C[catch22: This is also small. Black does not have to fight this ko. Black can ignore five moves before he has to respond. Each move gains White only a little over two points, whereas there are much bigger moves elsewhere on the board.]

(;B[ah]C[catch22: There's no need for Black to fight the ko at J2. See variation.]
;W[ch];B[ae];W[be];B[bd];W[af];B[iq];W[ad];B[ac]C[catch22: This is too greedy by Black. He should play at B17 instead. Fighting this ko is not favourable for Black. He stands to lose a lot, yet can gain only a little.]
;W[bc];B[ae]C[sm1983: I mishandled this situation pretty badly

catch22: Yes indeed. You have to continue the ko. It's a picknick ko, so you don't need big threats. I would start with P18 as a ko threat, as it is big endgame anyway.]
;W[ab];B[ad];W[cc]C[catch22: In a situation like this where you misread the situation, you should stop playing as soon as you realise it. If nothing else, you now have a couple of big ko threats here.]
;B[dd];W[cb];B[ba];W[db];B[eb];W[bb];B[da]C[catch22: No need. Black should just take sente. (Why is nobody willing to play P18? Why? ;-)]
;W[ia]C[catch22: Also very small. There are much better moves elsewhere: P3, B7, O2, T14, J12, to name just a few.]
;B[lh];W[lg];B[li];W[jg];B[nb];W[ob]C[catch22: Good. Black should have played here himself.]
;B[oc];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[nd];W[md];B[ks];W[ls]C[c];B[lr];W[js]
;B[ir];W[kq]C[catch22: Better play at N2 to capture the M2 stone.]
;B[nr]C[catch22: Black should have played at N1 first.];W[mr]
;B[lo]C[catch22: Strange.];W[or]C[catch22: Yes, that's a good response.]

;B[aj];W[ai];B[lq];W[lp];B[bi];W[so];B[sp];W[ai];B[hh];W[ak]
C[catch22: Yes, that's good. Black's ko threat was too small to respond to.]

If it is not essential and not worth many points either, see if there are bigger moves on the board elsewhere. Try to make every move count. You should aim to maximise the efficiency of every move you play.]

(;B[mh];W[nf];B[mg];W[pf]C[The two white groups are now connected, and Black's corner has been weakened. Black has to be careful there. White moves at R18 and S16 are starting to look dangerous.

Although Black has become very strong in the center, his stones are actually too overconcentrated, and it will be difficult to make much territory there, as White has no weak groups anymore but access to the center from various places.]

(;B[nf]C[Black can be stubborn, and not let White play O14.]

Finally, A White move at H7 or G8 is now a real threat to Black.

Admittedly, Black has now sente and can run away with H7, but that's okay. Let Black spend a move on that. Those stones are not doing anything constructive. The potential White territory they have taken away, White gets back at the top left anyway.]
