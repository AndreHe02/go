C[I am piter.
I have White.
I am French. My English is not very good. I ask you to excuse
of it to me.
Bonjour, Piter -- Ici Rick Mott.  Je suis Americaine, et votre
Anglais est certainement meilleur que ma Francais! :)];B[pp]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[dp]C[I always hesitate between points 4x4 and points 4x3. What is
preferable?

RickMott: 4-4 is usually the basis for a moyo (influence)
game,  but because this is a diagonal game moyo is not
likely.  So I would play 4-3, or possibly even 3-3.];B[nq]
(;W[jp]C[RickMott: consider 3rd line (see variation)
Also, this is not the biggest open area.  You do not have
to answer locally; consider making an extension on the
other side (R10, for example).  This would take away
a good extension for Black as well.  Moves with two
purposes are always preferable.];B[fq];W[fp]C[I chose a joseki but I don't know if it is the better.

RickMott: A contact play against a weak stone will
make it stronger.  Maybe an extension near D6
would be better.];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[fc]LB[cj:g][pj:e][jd:c]
[qj:d][dj:f]C[Here, I chose the approach of the stone of Hoshi but,  it would
not have preferable  to play in b or c or d or e or f or
g ?   In this case, the best move is it the one of the 3° line or
the one of the 4° line?

RickMott: The move you played is OK, but I think -d-
is a bit better because it also restricts  black's  extension.]

(;B[ec];W[fd];B[jd]C[RickMott: Black has made an unusual high pincer.  The
normal move for Black would be to extend down the
left side at D14 or nearby.    Since you have a 3-stone
wall at the bottom left with influence facing up the left
side, you also want to build moyo potential with it.

I would play at C14.]
(;W[pj]C[RickMott: Ok, this is an important area.  I think 3rd line
is better.];B[qn]C[RickMott: But this is a timid response by Black.  You will
want to play R8 at some future time.];W[lc]C[RickMott:  Good idea to take the base away from the black stone,
but as we discussed before attacking on the left side first is
better because you can build a position around your strength
in the lower left.  Then make a move like this.];B[qc]C[There is what justifies my question on the previous choice of
the point 4x4. This choice permits to be invaded to the san-san.

RickMott: Yes, but this is OK for you.  You will get influence on
the outside which will work well with your stones at Q10 and
M17, and the K16 black stone will be very weak and a target
for attack.];W[qd]C[RickMott: Correct, you should block from the wider side
first.];B[qb]C[RIckMott:  This is not joseki!  White should punish black for this
bad move.  Play Q17 and black barely lives in gote, and you get
strong outside positions on both sides.  See the variations.]

(;W[de];B[cd];W[ee]C[RickMott: you have less need to connect the two stones
than to build influence for the left side.  Play C15 instead.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[fa];W[dj]LB[qb:B][qc:B][ce:c]C[Before playing this move, should I have played in C15 (c) or
should have tried to kill the B group?

RickMott:  I think definitely you should initiate the sequence
I showed in the previous variation, starting with Q17.  You
will not kill, but you end with sente and get C15 or D10
anyway.];B[cl];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn];B[am];W[ql]LB[cl:C][bm:C][am:C]
C[Would not it have preferable that I insist here on the C group
that is weak?

RickMott:  Yes.  If you block at D9, black will have to work
hard to live (if he can) and your center influence should
be decisive.  An attack on the C group should end in sente
for you even if you cannot kill.

As a general principle of strategy, you should look for weak
groups to attack (or defend) before making a move like
R8 which only attempts to enclose territory.

When choosing between two weak groups (C group and
the single stone at K16), paradoxically you should attack
the stronger one first.  The influence you gain from that
attack makes it more likely to kill the other group, and
your opponent must defend because it is too many
stones to abandon.   This is how you end the attack
in sente.];B[rm];W[rl]C[RickMott; both small moves.  You should attack one of black's  weak groups.]
;B[hc]LB[gb:A]C[RickMott: You must defend the cutting stone at A!  If white
captures it, your top side potential is destroyed.];W[lq]C[RickMott:  No, you must defend the cutting stone at A]
;B[mr]C[RickMott: Black should not answer here, he should cut at
G17.];W[lr];B[gc]C[I didn't think about to avoid this move.

RickMott: Yes, this is the critical mistake of the game.  You
have lost your huge center potential, but black still has
weaknesses.  Attack the weak left-side group first.];W[hq]C[RickMott:  This is not important, because it does not attack
black and does not protect a weak white group.  Attacking
at D9 or Q17 would be much better.];B[gr]C[But since black responds locally every time, you get away
with it :)];W[hr]C[RickMott:  If you're going to attack, attack from the corner
side with a hane at C3.  But really, you should not respond
here.  Your groups are not in danger; attack the weak
black groups first.];B[gs];W[hs];B[cp]C[RickMott: There is at least 6-8 points difference between
black getting this move and your getting the hane at
C3.  You should get sente, also.];W[eb]C[Bad move!

About my next commentaries, I am going to make affirmations that
are also questions. I declare what I believe to be true but take
me if I am mistaken.

RickMott: yes, this doesn't work.];B[db];W[ga];B[ea]
(;W[hb]C[RickMott: Better to play J18 and force black to capture.  You
might be able to cut off K16.  See variation.];B[ib];W[ia];B[ha]
C[I lost the advantage of the wall that I had created.];W[pc]
C[RickMott:  Yes, good move.];B[pb];W[qq]C[It seems that I abandoned the North side without reason.

RickMott:  Yes, the correct plays in the upper right are in
the variations of move 22.];B[pq];W[qp];B[rr]
(;W[qr];B[pr];W[ps];B[os];W[qs];B[ro];W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[mq]
;W[qg]LB[ps:D][qs:D][qr:D][qq:D][qp:D]C[Did I do well to abandon my D group? Was it already dead?

RickMott:  Yes, but this is not the right choice of tenuki.
As we discussed several times already, you must attack
black's weak left-side group or his top-right corner.];B[cj]
C[RickMott: but black gets the first play, which helps him a
great deal.  As we look at the following moves, imagine
a white stone at D8 instead of at R13.  R13 only serves
to reinforce a side territory, not to attack.];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi]
;B[ai];W[ah];B[aj];W[bh];B[dl]C[RickMott: If there had been a white stone here already, this
group could not be saved.  Now it can escape to the center,
damaging your potential area in the process.];W[el];B[dm];W[dn]
;B[em];W[ek];B[bp]C[RickMott: this is a big move for Black, enlarging his corner
territory and threatening the connection between your two
3-stone groups.  It also threatens to connect his left-side
group to the corner by playing A6 next.  You must block
at A6 in order to have any chance to kill the group.]
(;W[qo]C[Ah, it seems that I have a remorse.

RickMott; yes, this only serves to make black stronger.];B[po]
;W[qm];B[rn];W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[rp];W[or]C[Hum!];B[nr]C[RickMott: it's hard to see how White can win now.  Black has
all 4 corners, and 3 of them are very large.  Black has broken
through the walls of White's center enclosures in three
places: near O5, near F7 and in the top center.  White's
walls do not work effectively together, so it will not be
easy to make enough territory.

If you continue this way, you will lose.  I think the only
possibility to win is to cut at A6 and try to kill the left
side group.  It may not be possible, but without it
victory is hopeless.]
(;W[he];B[cf];W[df];B[cg]C[I would probably have better makes to try to avoid this invasion
earlier. Thereafter, I lose a big group because of it..]
(;W[ch]C[RickMott; no, you must play D13 instead to preserve any
territory potential at all.];B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[dk];B[ck];W[fg]
LB[eh:b]C[would b have been better?

RickMott: hard to say.  Neither one helps much, I'm afraid.]
;B[eh];W[ei]C[From there, in spite of all my efforts, I could not have made
two eyes.];B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[ih];B[gi]C[RickMott: black is greatly reducing any potential center
territory you might get.  White is far behind now.];W[gj];B[hi]
;W[ij];B[ii];W[ji];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[fj];B[ik];W[jj];B[hl]
C[RickMott: you were trying so hard to block or capture the
black stones that you didn't see that your own group is in
danger.  The whte group at center left has only 1 eye (the
D11 point is a false eye) and is nearly surrounded.  I don't
think you can save it.

White has definitely lost now, unless black makes a
terrible mistake.];W[ke];B[kd];W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[jb];W[ld]
;B[fl]C[RickMott: this move is not necessary for black.  You cannot
escape.  He should play something like L8 instead to reduce
your territory even further.];W[fk]C[I don't have the two eyes.

RickMott; right.  I stopped commenting at this point, because
the game is hopeless for white now.  You cannot get enough
territory to make up for this huge loss.

I think you need most to work on understanding how to  see and attack your opponent's weak groups.  If you had
done that early, you would have been in much better
position.

Also, you need to learn when it is important to complete
a moyo or wall.  You tend to make small, local territory
moves which do not force your opponent to answer.

I wish you luck in future games!];B[gn];W[bg]C[I insist uselessly.]
