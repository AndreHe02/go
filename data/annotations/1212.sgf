C[Hello,i am B in this game.I lost by 3.5 points,but i think i
could win also.
As the game was processing i saw that W was somehow afraid-defensive,but
i couldn't find a way to attack him properly,so as to take the
win.
My main problem is that where i live (Greece,Athens) there are
no Go clubs,no teachers,not even books to read.So i must rely
on the web to study the various aspects of the game-and the only
place i can play is on IGS.
I play Go for 4 months(currently i am 24k*) and i would be very
pleased if you can spot my weak points-and my strong ones(if
i have any)-and give me guidelines.
Thank you.

I have added comments to several of the moves.  In many cases
I have marked points on the board, so be sure your viewer program
shows these marks.  Also, I have included several variations
to show how I would play in certain situations.  In each case
I will refer you to the variation in my comments.];B[pd];W[qp]
;B[cd];W[dq]C[Both Black and White have made standard opening moves.  I personally
prefer the variety of Black's opening with one 4-4 point stone
and one 4-3 point stone.  This is just a personal preference,
however.];B[oq]SQ[fq]C[This is the best approach move for Black to make.  White wants
to take the lower side, since he has a stone in both lower corners.
It is a good idea for Black to jump in and seperate white early
on.  An aproach move near the space marked with a square doesn't
threaten the lower left corner as much since White's stone is
lower there];W[po]
(;B[lq]TR[qm]SQ[mp]C[The point marked with a square is also a good response.  Playing
one line higher and closer to white presses white more.  Black's
current position is fairly secure but won't exert much influence
towards the center.  Black's move is passive.

Playing at the triange would be a very aggressive move.  White
should respond to that move with a pincer on one of the two attacking
black
stones.  Then black would have to run out into the center and
try to wrap around white's corner to contain it.  See the variation
for an example];W[qj];B[qh]SQ[ec][do][jd]C[This is not a big enough move for black.  There are still a lot
of places to play that are worth more.  The squares mark the
places I think are best to consider.  E17 makes a strong corner
for Black and provides a good base to extend down the left side.
K16 starts to claim the whole upper side for Black.  D5 attacks
the lower left corner.

Many beginning players feel that they must play near their opponent's
last stone.  Black is probably playing here because white just
played
near by.  Don't be afraid to play on the other side of the board
from your opponent's last move if you think that is the best
place.];W[pl]SQ[dg][co][ec][nc]C[This is too close to white's other stones.  The marked moves
are
all worth a lot more for white.];B[qf]C[Again, too close to Black's other stones for this early in the
game.  Remember that the opening is a time to sketch broad outlines
of territory.
You fill in the details later.];W[nc]SQ[ec]C[White should approach the other corner by playing at the square.
This corner is now too strong for White to threaten effectively]

(;B[oc]SQ[ld][lc][kd][kc]C[I would prefer a pincer here.  Any of the marked points is a
good choice.  Black has spent several moves making a strong group
along the upper right side.  Now Black can use this group to
drive white out into the center while building a wall along the
top.  See the variation];W[nd]SQ[ne]C[White should jump out to the square.  His stones are too close
together for running out into the middle.

In general, when invading then running, be willing to sacrifice
a few stones if they get cut off.  If you focus too much on connecting
all of the invading stones together, they will all be surrounded
together.  Letting your opponent have a few stones may save the
rest.];B[co]SQ[nd][nc]C[Playing away from white's last move is a acceptable choice here.
The
black group in the top right corner is safe and needs no more
help.  The marked White stones are still very weak, however,
and Black could make a lot of profit by attacking them before
they can get stronger.];W[ep];B[cl]TR[hq][hp]SQ[dm]C[Again, I like extending to the square better.  It is a good idea
to try balancing the number of stones you play on the third line
and the fourth line during the opening.  Black has almost all
third line stones now.  This will make it hard for Black to influence
the center later in the game.

The triangles are also good moves to consider.  Playing here
takes
advantage of black's existing stones on the bottom.   White won't
be able to pincer a stone at one of the triangles.  So White
will either
run into the center or pincer black by playing near move 17]
;W[hq];B[jq]TR[lo]SQ[jd][jc][dh][dg][ec]C[This is too close to Black's group.  The moves marked with squares
are all better choices.  If Black feels he must strengthen the
bottom group, playing at the triangle is better.];W[jc]SQ[nc]
[nd]C[This was a very big move for white.  Until now, the two marked
white stones have been very weak since they are so close to a
strong black corner.  This was by far the weakest group on the
board.  Now it is much stonger and less vulnerable to attack.

Whatever is a good move for your opponent is also probably a
good place for you to play first and foil his plans.  So, when
considering your move, always take a moment to think what your
opponent would want to play next and consider playing there first.]
;B[en]TR[cq][gq]SQ[di]C[Playing at the square also extends Black's left side group but
it takes more territory.  The White group in the lower left corner
is strong, so White can ignore threats to surround it for now.
If Black really wants to play this attacking move, he should
follow up the attack by playing at one of the triangles next
turn];W[ec]
(;B[dc]TR[gc][gd]SQ[ee]C[I prefer playing at the square here.  It starts to build a wall
facing Black's stones farther down the left side.  I also threatens
invade around the triangles.  See the variation];W[ed];B[cf]
SQ[df][cg]C[I prefer one of the marked places better.  Black's upper left
corner is fairly strong and so black can afford to play out a
bit farther.

Black is still playing on the third line too often.];W[ci]C[When faced with an invasion, you have two basic types of responses.

First, you can try to surround and crush the invader.  This means
trying to cut the invading stones off from the center and kill
them.  If you can't kill the invaders, you may have to settle
for White making a small life on the side while you build a large
wall facing the center.  This
lets white take up more of your territory on the side if he lives.

Second, you can try to drive white out of you area while securing
as much of your territory as you can.  This means not trying
to kill white, just drive him out.  You can build a lot of power
while driving White in the direction of your choice.

Decide which of these two basic plans you want to use before
you play your
first response.  Try not to change plans half way though.]
(;B[bj]C[This move is too low.  Black should play here only if  one of
his groups is about to die. This move could be used to connect
under White's stone to a living Black group.

There are two variations here.  One is an attempt to surround
and kill white.  The other is an attempt to drive white out to
the center while making profit for Black.];W[ei];B[gn]SQ[eg]
[fk]C[This changes the focus from the weak white side group to the
white corner group.  While you can do this sort of "back and
forth" play to confuse your opponent, I would suggest finishing
one area before moving to another.  I would play one of the marked
spaces to keep pressure on the left side white group.];W[cp]

[ef:33][ge:34]C[Black is doing a good job of driving white.  Black is building
power on the upper left side while White's stones still are weak
and have no eyes.];B[io]TR[qp][po][pl][qj]SQ[jk]C[White should be running towards the strong white group on the
lower right side.  So, blocking around the square seems better
to me.];W[hm]SQ[jk][jl]C[White should play on one of the squares and keep running away.]

(;B[hn]C[This isn't needed.  If white plays here black can block one space
below this move.  Black should continue to wrap around white
from above.  See the variation.];W[fm]
(;B[fn]C[This is a passive defence move.  White's group is weaker that
any of black's.  So, black should be more aggressive in attacking
white here.  See the variation for one possibility.];W[gm];B[im]
;W[il];B[jm];W[jl];B[qr]C[Don't leave a job partially done.  White is still not settled.
White doesn't have two definite eyes and he is not yet connected
to
the right side.  Keep the pressure on White until the group is
settled.];W[em];B[dn]TR[dk][dl]SQ[dm]C[Another overly passive defensive move.  The square is a little
better.
Playing one of the triangles threatens to take White's eye space
and cut his group apart.];W[dm];B[cm];W[dl];B[ck]SQ[dk]C[The marked move is better.]
;W[fk]C[Now white has settled his stones];B[ch]C[This is a good defensive move.  White could severely undercut
Black if this is not played];W[bi];B[bh];W[eh];B[eg];W[gi];B[ih]
;W[je]C[White now has a very strong area on the upper side.]
;B[if];W[ie];B[jj];W[mf];B[pi]C[This is a good move.  It presses White while moving Black into
the center.  Moves that do more than one job (like attack and
defend) are almost always the best moves.];W[pj];B[oi];W[oj]
;B[ni]SQ[on]C[Black is building a wall facing strong white stones on the top.
This wall won't be of much use.  White is building a wall that
extends his moyo on the side and begins to make it actual territory.

Playing at the square will reduce White's potential territory
a lot];W[no];B[np];W[oo]TR[nm][nj]SQ[nf]C[Playing the square makes use of black's wall on the right side
to make some territory.

Playing on a trinagle starts to reduce white's moyo on the lower
right side.]
(;B[eb]C[This is not the best way to reduce white's area on the second
line.  This move should be Gote for Black.  See the variation
for another way to do this in Sente.  It shows the consequences
for white if he doesn't respond.];W[fb];B[db]
(;W[gc]C[White doesn't have to do this.  White should take Sente and play
somewhere else.

See the variation for what happens if white doesn't play here]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[lc]C[Again, White doesn't need to do this move.  Black should be in
Gote now, but White gives Black a free move.];B[nj];W[nk];B[mk]
;W[nl];B[ml];W[nm];B[mm];W[mo];B[mp];W[lo]
(;B[ko]SQ[gq][ir]C[This move doesn't do much.  Both black groups are alive, so it
isn't a big problem if white cuts them apart.  Black should press
the lower left corner to reduce it's size.  The marked moves
are both good ways to start];W[gp];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[jf];B[jg]
;W[kg];B[kh]LB[jg:5]C[These are nice light jumps and they take advantage of Black's
existing stones];W[lg];B[lh];W[ng];B[og]SQ[oe][ri][rq]C[This is too passive.  Playing on one of the squares is more likely
to be Sente for black.];W[of];B[pf];W[oe];B[pe];W[mh];B[mi]
;W[oh]TR[qg]SQ[og][ri][rq][ap][hs]C[The marked stone isn't worth much.  Also, saving it is Gote.
All of the moves marked with squares are worth more and are Sente
for black.

At worst, white will capture the stone and black will have to
play at the triangle to connect.];B[pg];W[nh]SQ[ri][pq][rq]
[ao][cj][de]C[This is Gote.  All of the marked moves should be Sente for White
and are worth more.];B[kl];W[jk];B[kk];W[ij];B[ii];W[hj]C[White should play a bigger move now and connect here later.]
;B[rq];W[rp];B[qq]TR[dc][db][eb]SQ[rq][qq][qr]C[This is Gote.  Black should play another Sente move now.

If you notice that you are about to make an empty triangle, like
the stones marked with squares, then reconsider you move carefully.
An empty triangle is usually not the best move in any situation.
A filled triangle like the stones marked with triangles is more
likely to be a good move.];W[ri];B[rh];W[si];B[sh];W[qi];B[ph]
SQ[hf][sp][hs][ap]C[Black doesn't need to connect here.  Both the upper right corner
and the center group are alive.  White can't hurt Black by seperating
them.  So, this move is worth zero points for black.

Using this move to play the Sente moves at each square is probably
enough for Black to win the game];W[hf];B[ig]C[There are still moves left that are worth more to Black than
saving this one stone.];W[de];B[ee];W[dd];B[ce];W[df];B[dg]

actually affect the score];B[mn];W[nn];B[kj]SQ[dk][hs][ap]C[I don't think you have to do this, but it is never a bad idea

This variation is included just as an example.  White has too
much space to be contained in this situation if white plays resonably
well.  Also, all of black's stones being on the third line makes
it harder for black to choose to surround.];W[eh];B[dh];W[di]

(;B[dj]TR[dh]SQ[ek]C[A "shoulder hit" is a good way to start driving white out.  Playing
at the square would also work.

I think black's upper left corner is stronger than the group
on the lower left side.  Playing here rather than at the triangle
drives
white towards the stronger group.   It also strengthens the weaker
black side group.  Always drive your opponent towards your strong
groups and away from your weak groups.];W[di];B[ej];W[ei];B[fj]

walls and thus is no real use.]))

probably break out.  Black should plan to press white's group

to kill the white corner.

live that to try to kill outright.  You can gain a lot in other
areas as your opponent focuses on keeping the one weak group
alive.]))
