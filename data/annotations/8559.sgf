C[Hi JUG,

I will try my best to give you a streamlined and easy to understand review :)
Please note that I will focus on the absolute fundamentals rather than reading mistakes. I strongly believe that preventing disadvantageous situations is better than fixing them.

I hope you enjoy this review.

-------------------

JUG: I played White in this game on a tournament in a nearby city.

I'm aware, that corners are big, but after Bs tengen i aimed to play a center-crosscut, because i often lack in fighting games, so took this as a chance to learn something about it.

I've added some questions along the way and some of what i thought during the game, but mainly i'm interested in comments on:
- bad thinking / logic ?
- how to play such a game ?
- how to better handle invasions (top and right side) ?
- how to better handle the bottom at the end-stage of the game ?

Please review for White!

Thanks in advance for any help on this game.];B[jj]TR[jd][ig]
[km][jp]C[JUG: actually, B revealed after the game, that he aimed for a "great wall" (http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall) leaving all corners to W, but ...

-----------

The question is not "what is he trying to do?" but "does he know what he's doing?"

Often, when players play with a fixed strategy in mind, they will miss a lot of other things.

The flow of the stones dictate the pace of the game, not the player's strategy. Strategy often conflicts with flow. What you want is not always the best move.]
(;W[kj]C[JUG: ... W thought, always wanted to try this ... and learn something ... and have a fun game ;-)

---------

Touching makes black stronger and white weaker. Black gets the first move, which means he has 1 more stone and is 1 move ahead in the fight until all shapes are settled.]
;B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[ii];B[jk];W[lj]C[JUG: no big choices till here after the crosscut

-------

This is a must. But black has sente now.];B[mi];W[ll];B[hj]
;W[jg];B[nh]LB[nk:A]C[JUG: W took 'A' to prevent B playing there.

-----------

The fundamental principles of Go dictate that weak shapes must be fixed for yourself, and attack for the opponent.

With A you are putting pressure on a strong black group while fixing your own weakness.]
(;W[nk];B[gk]LB[ji:A]C[Black fixes his shape and puts pressure on group A]
(;W[hf]C[This is too loose. White is better off fixing solidly. In complicated fights, it's best to play very solid to not leave weakness.

Too much weakness will make your game crumble.

A house cannot be built on an unstable foundation.
A fight cannot be started without solid groups.]
(;B[pc]
(;W[md]C[JUG: W wants to develop the top

--------

There is nothing to develop.];B[oe]LB[md:B][pe:A]C[JUG: shouldn't this be lower (perhaps on 'A') ?

--------

This is fine by black. It puts pressure on the lone white stone at B, and aims to take a big corner later.]
;W[jd]C[White has to fix!

Very good.];B[pj];W[pp]LB[nk:A]C[JUG: wanted to avoid too much pressure on 'A'-group (if B takes SE-corner)

-------

Protect weakness. Good idea.];B[hi]
(;W[ig]C[JUG: protecting the cut, ... but was is still necessary ?

--------

Yes (see variation)];B[nc]C[JUG: looks slow

-------

It is slow. The corners are bigger.];W[pl]LB[qh:A][nk:B]C[JUG: prepare for later 'A'-invasion and help 'B'-group

---------

Thinking about invading at A seems unreasonable right now.

The corners are biggest!];B[dj];W[dd]C[Good!];B[df];W[fd];B[cd]
;W[cc];B[ce];W[bc]C[White just gained lots of points.];B[ff]
LB[dp:A]C[JUG: expected B to take 'A'-corner instead

------

Me too.]
(;W[dp]LB[cp:A]C[The idea is correct, but the execution should be at A.

Black can approach from the left now.];B[cn]C[White must respond, this is favorable for black.]
;W[fp]LB[dn:A]C[JUG: develop bottom, though about 'A' too (would that help B too much on the left side) ?]
;B[bp];W[cq]
(;B[cj]LB[hq:A]C[JUG: B seems afraid, but sure looks big to protect against invasions !?

----------

Black knows his advantage and wants to protect his points.

A better move would be to play at A.];W[em];B[dl]C[Black wasted 2 moves.]
;W[dm]LB[jp:A]C[JUG: thank-you move ?

----------

This is unnecessary. It only makes black stronger.

A move around the A area would be better.];B[cm];W[hl]C[Aji keshi. You are forcing black to become stronger while gaining no points.]
;B[hk];W[ip];B[jm]LB[mc:C][rl:A][mq:B]C[Black has roughly 60 points
White has roughly 67,5 points

White should not be greedy and keep his lead while controlling his opponents points.

A, B and C are viable options. They create lots of points.]
;W[jo]LB[nq:A]C[JUG: too optimistic ?

---------

This does not fix the invasion at A]
(;B[hc]LB[cc:A][jd:B]C[JUG: looks like a good invasion-point. How best to cope with this ?

-------

Evaluate where the weaknesses of your groups are. Fix your weakness (while pressuring black's invading stone).

A can live, so pressure black from B's direction.];W[ic]LB[mc:B]
[jo:A]C[Touching makes black stronger.

If you played A at B, this would not be a problem :)

(See opening comment: "preventing is better than fixing")];B[ge]
;W[hd];B[ec]
(;W[fc];B[ed];W[eb];B[ql]C[The top left looks dire for white.

White was too greedy and did not consider his own weakness enough.]
;W[qm];B[qk];W[qf]LB[ee:A][pm:B]C[JUG: too late for invasion ? ... or better where (perhaps removing aji at 'A' or ...) ?

-------

Too early for an invasion. White has a severe cut at B. This needs to be fixed first.]
(;B[ee]LB[fb:A][qi:B]C[JUG: here W struggled a lot of of giving up the NW-corner and continue on the invasion with 'B' or similar (W was not sure what's bigger) !?

----------

The top left situation should have been avoided. Not fixed.

White needs to do damage control.];W[fb];B[qh]LB[qf:A]C[JUG: is there still a possibility to live with 'A' ?

----------

No.];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc]

;W[pn];B[om];W[ln];B[dc];W[db];B[kd];W[mc]LB[kd:A]C[JUG: close the top, avoid connection of B, connect for W, pressure on Bs 'A'-stone]
;B[kf];W[kc]C[JUG: too timid ?

------

White needs to reduce as much from black's points as possible.]
;B[bd];W[mf]LB[bq:A]C[JUG: unsatisfied with this, where better to approach ?

------

In the early endgame, corners before sides before center.

This is a center move. Focus on corners first.

A is biggest];B[ne];W[me];B[kg]
(;W[he]LB[hc:A]C[JUG: was afraid of aji of 'A'-stone]
(;B[lo];W[mn];B[fm]C[JUG: up to here W should have a lead, but I had the feeling the big mistakes started here ...]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[gn];B[hn];W[hm]LB[ho:A]C[JUG: perhaps just 'A' instead, but i often have the feeling, that my moves are somewhat timid ...

------

White cannot cut.];B[ho]
(;W[el]C[JUG: felt not good about this move, but how else to proceed here ?

------

Start the endgame.
I am going to end the review here because the rest is a series of unreasonable moves from both sides.

I hope the review was useful.];B[gl];W[hp];B[ek];W[bq];B[or]
;W[pr];B[cp];W[do]LB[go:A]C[JUG: W at 'A' first looks better ?]
;B[en];W[dn]LB[em:B][hm:C][go:A]C[JUG: still 'A' looks better (giving up 3 stones (at 'B') as it threatens to save Ws center-stones ('C') ?]

;B[fh];W[gg];B[fg];W[ap];B[bo];W[ok];B[pk];W[kn]C[JUG: still it looks like W had the lead ... how to better keep it ?]

;B[rp];W[rr];B[ao];W[aq];B[eq]C[JUG: now the big mistakes start again ... it looks i always took the worst possible move locally ... how better to cope with Bs advances ?]
;W[dq]LB[ep:A]C[JUG: perhaps better W at 'A' ? ... this looks like reading mistakes]
;B[jq];W[mq];B[jp];W[lq];B[hr];W[kr]LB[hp:A]C[JUG: this looks dead wrong, but didn't find a good point on the left as there was the danger that 'A'-group is cut !?]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fq];W[iq]C[JUG: very bad move again];B[ir];W[jr]
;B[io];W[kp];B[gq];W[kq];B[dr]C[Jens: game-over, but we played on ...]
