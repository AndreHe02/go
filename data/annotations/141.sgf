(;B[fn]C[Rob- d8 is joseki here, and I think it is superior.];W[cl];B[hp]
M[cn][dn][fn]C[This seems to be an overplay in retrospect.  My weak stones at  d6 are just not strong enough
to support an invasion.

Rob- Yes, I agree. Funny thing is, this part of it doesn't really end up bad  for b.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[ho]L[fc]C[I would have been  quite tempted to tenuki, and do f17..]

;W[ip];B[iq];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[fj]C[This is  an overplay?

Rob- It might be, but I kind of like it. I think this move leads to this  group being thickness at one point, rather than a weak group]
;W[el];B[gl];W[eh];B[ej];W[di]C[This exchange didn't help me at all, and in  fact helped w

Rob- Yes, I agree, classic aji keshi];B[gh];W[cc];B[qc]L[km][ph][md]
C[Rob- I'm not wild about r17. I realize that you are behind on territory at  this point, but I
don't like the idea of abandoning the strength you have in the game, notably  thickness, for a
slow territorial move like r17.   A further thing to realize, when looking at this board, is that there is some  aji in the
lower right corner, I think.

I would have been more keen on something like l7, q12, or n16..]
(;W[km];B[nq]L[kk][ph]C[Rob- Again, I feel o3 is too slow. It doesn't attack  anything, and protects a group that seems to me to be alive.

Maybe a cap at l9? Or possibly q12..];W[jk];B[il];W[ok];B[oj]L[pm][pi]
C[Maybe a would  be better?

Rob- I believe a would be better than the move you made, but b would be  better than either :)

It is a standard play to make an oblique knights move (like a or b) when  capped.]
;W[pj];B[pk]C[Rob - Now that l7 and k9 are on the  board, you are not strong locally, so it seems a fight might favor w.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[pg];B[oh];W[ph];B[ol];W[nk];B[mi]L[og]C[Rob- I'm sure that p13  would be better than 57 here.]
;W[og];B[mj];W[ml];B[nl]L[ng]C[Rob 61 is  not good. You are forcing w to connect, which is fine with him, and you are  hurting your own weak group

I feel o13 would be better.];W[mk];B[pm]L[ng][ji]C[Rob- Pretty clear  that 63 is bad. q8 is not a cut, just a ladder..

Again, I'd say o13 or maybe k11 are better..];W[mg];B[jl]M[mg]L[kh]
[ki]C[Starting this fight is what killed me!  Better to  play around a to keep w separated and my
stones connected?

Rob - I think what really hurt was the wasted move at q7. a is a cuttable  shape, perhaps b
would be better?

Letting w get n13 was just a killer.];W[kl];B[kk]C[This cut  just doesn't work.  I was lazy and did not read it out (I was playing too  fast)]
;W[kj];B[lj]L[kh][ki]C[And to compound my error I make bad shape here for no  benefit.  Again a should be better?  No!
That can be cut.  b seems to work though.

Rob- b is the shape];W[lk];B[ki];W[ji];B[kh];W[ig]M[ig]C[Rob - j13 seems to sound a probable death knell for one group or the other.  I can't see any way to save both.]
;B[ij]C[I thought this peep would give me  some breating room (but I was wrong)

Rob- j10 is a fine move to try and live. Problem is that after w connects, if  you don't l14, w will, killing your group..

Perhaps if after j10 k10 exchane, if you j11, it does threaten to cut w.. not  sure if it lives though.]
;W[jj]C[Rob - See Variation 1 for *possible* way to  save both..]
(;B[kf];W[ik];B[hk]C[I thought a long time about this move and  didn't know what to do.  I started to get worried that my group here would  not have room to make two eyes, so I thought this would give me some shape.]
;W[hj];B[ii]L[gj][fl]C[I just plain misread this sequence.  I thought my stone could  escape but I was wrong due to
the threat of the cut at l13 by w.  Maybe I could have lived by playing at a,  which would
allow me to make an eye in gote by playing at b, and I ought to be able to  make h8 into an
eye.

Rob- yes, problem here is that it was very difficult to save both these  groups.

As I look at it further, I think the sequence you outline may have worked.  I'm not
quite good enough to tell though :)];W[hi];B[ih];W[jh]C[
 rich 25k : ouch!];B[jg];W[hh];B[gj];W[ek]
(;B[fl]L[hm]C[This does not work. My best  chance for life seems to be at h7 (a), but it seems that w can
make all my eyes false (see variation)

Rob - Yeah, I agree.];W[fk];B[gk];W[em];B[hm];W[en];B[jn]C[This  is no way to make an eye!]

;W[fg];B[gg];W[de];B[me]C[Seems I should have  realized earlier than my group was dead and left it alone.  At least the  stones would have more aji than they do now.]
;W[jb];B[kb]L[kc]C[This doesn't work.   maybe l17 (a) would be better?

Rob - Yes, l17 is the shape here..];W[kc];B[lb];W[jc];B[lc];W[kd];B[ke]
L[le]C[Rob - Should have m15 instead of l15];W[ld];B[md];W[le]C[Oops.  It was only at this point that I realized that w would  cut off and kill my other center group :(

Rob - Yeah :(];B[mf];W[lf];B[ng];W[lg];B[mh]L[nh]C[Rob - If this is at  o12, you save the body of that group.]
;W[nf]C[
 rich 25k : you're just too strong at tactics for me ...
At this point I resigned the game since w owned the entire center of the  board!  Maybe I
should have tried to kill the w group q13 to save my center group but it  seems my stones don't
have enough liberties to fight.

Rob- I think this is true. Not a bad time to resign.

Some final comments: I think the main lesson of this game is, realize where  you are strong, and play to it. That doesn't mean to overconcentrate your  stones, but to realize where your potential in that game lies, and take  advantage of it. I think you played pretty well in this game, but just made a  few slow moves, which got you into trouble against a stronger fighter.]

(;W[dq];B[bo];W[cp];B[bp];W[bq]C[Rob- You've reduced his corner, and  possibly got an eye if things got tight-   Though he would probably play the other variation if you were tight on eye  space. In which
case I feel you had a reasonable chance to live])))
