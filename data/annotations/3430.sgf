C[Hello, I am Jeffery from Hong Kong, SAR, China. Thanks for your time and reviewing my game.

Actually, I lost this game, just because White resign without any reason. However, I know the fact that I lost, and I want to improve, thus I send this for review.

AGA ranked 5 kyu (several years ago)
I don't play that much anymore, but when I do, I think that I am still around 5 kyu.

If  anybody has any questions about this review, please send me email.

All of my comments will begin with "RR:"

I am using WinMGT to review this game.  I don't usually use variations (can get confusing quickly) but I'll put a string of stones one a single display.

I will review this game for Black.];B[pd];W[qp];B[dc];W[dq]
TR[ce]MA[jd]C[C: Now, I thought that I have to do something on one of the corner, so I did P4.

Q: Am I right? Or I have to capture some other big place?

RR:  Black has two corners, and white has two corners.  Why does black think that he has to "attack" white's corner?  I think a play in the upper left corner is better.  Enclose the corner, and threaten to extend along the top side (K-16).]
;B[op]C[Q: Should I play P3?

RR:  If black wants to attack this corner, from this direction, these are the things to consider.

1.  The stone a D-3 is on the 3rd line.  So, white will not want to extend towards that stone (better to extend towards a stone on the 4th line.
2.  The black stone at Q16 is on the 4th line, so white can extend up towards it on the 3rd line, and be OK.

So, it would be better to attack from the top, but since the white stone is on the 3rd line, I think black took the right direction.  As for the difference between the 3rd line and 4th line, that is a tough call.  Because of the white stone at D3 on the 3rd line, it would be bad/hard for black to extend towards it, so I think the 4th line is the best place.]
;W[lp];B[om]TR[on]C[Q: Is this too weak? Should I play R3 instead?

RR:  I think the 1 space jump is better.  White will have to jump out too, and then you can either jump into the corner with R3, or leave that option for later in the game.  Also, if black gets strong here, then black can play in the G4 area and put white in trouble by pincering the M4 stone.]
;W[oq];B[qm];W[np];B[oo];W[pp];B[ce]TR[qi]C[RR:  Black gets a big point in the upper left.  The lower right was a good exchange for white, as black still has no base, and white has the corner and a good base to build into the lower left side.  Black needs a stone in the R11 area to make the area stronger.]
;W[jc];B[gc]TR[mc][qi]C[RR:  Black is very cramped here.  to use this situation better, black should play on the right side, and force white to play in the area where black is strong.  Now the black stones are over concentrated on the upper left.  
However, Black should play on the right side.  See my prevous comment.]
;W[nc];B[pb]TR[pf]C[RR:  when attacked from one side, sometimes it is better to extend to the other way.  Share the corner with white, and extend towards your semi-weak stones on the lower right side.]
;W[qf];B[of]TR[lc][qh]C[C: I thought when I play S16, that would be too small for the corner, so I did P14 to make outlet. However, at the end of the game I failed because of did not connect well.

Q: Actually, is this OK? And how to respond to this correctly?

RR:  I believe that S16 is the wrong move.  In this situation, I usually play P15, which is a solid connection.  Also, black gets strong, white will have two weak groups.  See the marked locations for white's weak areas.]
;W[qi];B[re]TR[oi]C[RR:  This move gives too many cutting points.  If you can't get the corner easily, then continue jumping out into the center.  See the marked spot.  Once white lives on the side, black can concentrate on the two white stones on the top.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[pj];W[rd];B[rc];W[se];B[me]TR[lb][lc][md]
C[RR:  Better attack moves are marked.  The black move doesn't put enough pressure on white, and it also doesn't protect the cut.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[mc]C[RR:  This move makes white stronger, while doing little to make black stronger.]
;B[le];W[kd];B[ke]C[Q: Is K14 better than this move?

RR:  Yes.  Black is pushing white from behind, which is usually a bad thing to do.]
;W[je];B[kg]C[C: Originally, I just thought those four stone were too weak, so I did this, and miss the sente to capture C10 or D10.

RR:  True.];W[cj];B[ch]TR[do]MA[cq][cl][fo][ep]C[Q: Should I play D5 instead?

C: Because, after several steps, I found that I could not invade the corner anymore.

RR:  The next move for black is hard.  There are no black stones in the lower left corner.  White has the lower right corner, and small groups on the right side and the top side.  Black has a top left corner, a small group onthe top right, and some floating stones in the middle.  Black is behind at this point.  Black can play at the marked spot, and have several follow up moves. (marked with an X)]
;W[ej];B[eh];W[co]TR[iq]C[C: After this, I knew that corner was white. Poor.

RR:  Black has one spot to try, which is marked.  But White has a pretty good hold on the lower left corner of the board.]
;B[jq]C[C: Therefore, I thought that I have to do something on white territory, so I invaded at K3. But I found that it was too close.

Q: How to invade correctly?

RR:  I think you were very close.  This is the right area to try.  By playing one more spot to the left, it gives room to jump to the left or right, depending on what white does.]
;W[hq];B[jo]TR[gq][mq]C[C: After (W)44, I had to jump up to escape. Too bad.

Q: Is there any other moves to save black stone?

RR:  This would be my move too.  Either that or start a fight by playing next to the white stone.  Also, black can play a forcing move at N3.]
;W[no];B[on]TR[jm]C[RR:  This is a hard move for black to make.  It only saves the 2 black stones, which if captured, wouldn't give white too many points.  It might be a good stratagy to ignore white's move, and save the middle 2 stones.]
;W[ip];B[jp];W[hn];B[lr]C[RR:  Better to try and keep jumping out to the center.  Make life on the edge as a last chance, or if you are sure it will work.]
;W[mq];B[ln]TR[jm]C[RR:  I like the jump out better.  Can connect  at the top or on the side.  This move can be cut and black can be cut off.]
;W[rk]TR[pi]C[Q: How to respond to this? How to get back the sente to expend?

RR:  since black was on the 4th line, and white was on the 3rd line, black had no claim to the right side.  For a Sente move, you can push along the marked stone on the 4th line.  That would give black a good moyo for some territory in the middle.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[qk]TR[ql][pi]C[RR:  Empty triangle is almost always the wrong move.  Play one more out if you want to play in this area.  I still think that pusing on the 4th line at Q11 is better.]
;W[jm]C[RR:  Setup to cut black stones.  Also use to reduce the black moyo.]
;B[pi];W[qh];B[ph]TR[kn]C[C: I think this should play M8 too save my stones.

Q: How can I protect my stones?

RR:  This move is not needed.  Should protect stones by playing at L6.]
;W[ll];B[li];W[mm]C[C: Now, I knew that all my stones were dead. However, I still tried my very best to save my poor black stones.

RR:  yeah, the black stones are in a bad shape now.];B[mn];W[nn]
;B[ir];W[hr];B[mr];W[nr];B[ro];W[rp];B[qn];W[nm];B[lq];W[kr]
C[RR:  I can't see how black can live after this.  (Unless Black can start a Ko)]
;B[kq];W[jn];B[ks];W[ms]C[C: Totally, destroyed. Haha.];B[kk]
C[Q: Can L8 save my poor black stones?

RR:  I don't see how, unless you can start a big fight.  There is a snap-back possibility at N4.  If black can surround the liberties of the O7 group, then there might be a snapback by black playing at N4, but that is a long shot.]

;W[hd];B[gd];W[ib];B[gb];W[if];B[ig];W[hg]C[C: After revision, I think I should have played H14 instead.

Q: Am I right? Or having other good moves?

RR:  I don't think that H14 is any better..  I suppose black could capture the H13 stone, but extending out is good too.]
;B[ih];W[gf];B[ff];W[fg];B[ef];W[gi];B[fh];W[gh];B[gj];W[fj]
;B[lk];W[mk];B[lj];W[pe];B[oe]C[C: I think this should be P16 instead, so as to prevent my corner black stones from attack.

Q: Am I right?

RR:  Yes, P16 would connect the corner to the center.];W[od]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[nb];W[mb];B[na];W[rb]LB[qb:a][sc:b][qc:c][sb:d]
[ra:e]C[Q: How can I respond to this terrible strong move?

RR:  To live in the corner, black can play the sequence shown.]

;B[ii];W[ne];B[nf];W[hf];B[gr];W[hs];B[gp];W[hp];B[in];W[im]
;B[tt]C[C: White resign without any reason.

Q: What do you think my weakness in this game in general?
What aspects do you think I should improve?

RR:  Blacks play was very good in this game.  I think that black attacked too early, and was more afraid of white getting a territory instead of building blacks territory.  There were two or three times when black should have played in the lower left corner, but didn't.  Black was behind from the beginning, with the exchange in the lower right corner, it was a tough fight.  
Also, black should work on staying connected, and play moves which keep the stones better connected.]
