C[Dear Reviewer:

Thanks for reviewing my game. I lost this game by a small margin, but i felt that I was winning before the huge loss in the lower left.
My main questions are:

1) How else should I have handled the invasion on top?

2) how to invade into W's bottom framework?

3)Could you please comment on my beginning and middle game and give pointers on places to improve on?

Thanks very much for the review!

Hi,

First of all, I think you can learn more from a slow paced game, or maybe the lesson is to play more slowly, calculating a few variations, because some of the movesy, especially what happened in the lower left, suggests very fast play without much thinking. On the other hand, you have good fighting spirit, so keep that!

Secondly, I think you have a decent strategic thinking for a 3k, but lack some fundamental technique. In particular, you don't seem to care too much about liberties. This leads to
- thank you moves
- moves better left unplayed (aji-keshi)
- bad shape (in terms of not enough liberties)

Therefore, I advise books and articles on technique.
- Haengma tutorial for beginners, on Sensei's Library by Minue
- L'ame du go (translated to English), on sensei's library, by Fan Hui
- Suji and AntiSuji of Go, by Sakata Eijo
...

I'll comment hereafter along these lines of thought. You're welcome to discuss more about it, possibly as a BQM on Sensei's Library.

Yes you can hane at the head of two, but these two are actually stronger than that: White has the tiger mouth at B in sente. This means that the cut at A is stronger than it may seem.]
;W[po];B[qo];W[pl];B[pp]LB[no:A]C[This move must be left unplayed. It doesn't increase the liberties of your stones and it forces White to make a connection. You hence only lose possibilities: the peep at A or possible ataris.]

dv: Your move and A both reduce the moyo. Therefore I would play at the bottom (B). After your move, White still has chances to make much territory.]

(;B[cp]C[see var];W[bq];B[co]LB[eq:A]C[The mistake here is very fundamental. You were in a crosscut in enemy influence. Your task is to sacrifice one part and save the other by doing so. Obviously you have more chances to save your stronger stone, which is the one at the bottom, having more space.

You defend and strengthen the weakest stone in the crosscut, which is good if you want to keep both.

So A would have been better.];W[eq];B[dr];W[er];B[ep];W[do]
