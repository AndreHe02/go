C[Hi, 
I will try to point you in thinking more clearly on your moves in this game. 
Please read my specific comments as examples of concepts. 
You will find it will help you much more :)

It is clear you know a few joseki, and opening theory, 
You have two big weakness points in this game:
1. You do not look enough if what you learned is good for the scenario on the board
2. Because of a weak opening you started running after your opponent and let him lead the game. 

My most important tip for you, every move look at the whole board before you put your stone, decide on at least 3 key places you wish to play and only then choose the best. Remember your opponent is not much better than you, and most of his moves are also mistakes :)]
;B[jd]C[Playing the star point is a good move at the opening. It implies you aim for the center and sides, and you care less about the corner. It is a move which pays out in the long run. 

The problem is you play a 13x13 game. The game is short with no "long run"
The center is small and there are hardly any sides, the corner is much more important.

This move is possible, but you need to be stronger to use it correctly. 
3x3 point or 4x3 are easier.];W[kj];B[dj];W[dc]C[White has stronger base, black is already weaker. 
Black will need to be very aggressive to pull this off];B[ce]
C[Good move! Take out the base.];W[cd];B[de]LB[dj:A]MA[di]C[Correct. 
If two than three rule. 
Your two stone pillar need A to be one line closer (x) . Remember you have a weakness on the left side]
;W[fc]C[White made a secure base];B[hc]LB[jd:A][ik:B]MA[kf]
C[White is very secure in the top left. 
Black 9 does not threaten him in any way. 
That means your move gave up sente, 
White does not need to respond and he takes the lead. 

Extending from A is a good idea, but you chose the top which is smaller than the right. (X) is better. B is even better.]
;W[ch]
(;B[fk]C[Your joseki is correct. 
But it does not take into account the two black stones in the top left. 
White can easily attack them if you are not quick.];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[bk];B[bl]LB[ik:A]C[White is crawling into the corner. 
Black started with the star points - claiming the center and not the corner. 

It is much better to play faster where you have influence and let white gain 2 more points. 

A would be a good choice];W[cj];B[dl];W[di];B[ej];W[ge];B[kf]
LB[kc:A][ke:B]C[This move is dangerous. 
It feels like you protect the corner but it does not secure it. 
White at A can easily live inside. 
Black at B will secure the corner. 

However the most important move is to secure the two black stones on the left. 

Always look at the whole board and see what your opponents move tries to achieve. 
The top right corner is not under immediate attack after white 20. The black stones on the left are.]
;W[ik]C[This is a strong move by white. 
The fuseki is over.];B[fg]LB[ef:A]C[What does this move try to achieve?
White can easily cut at A

It does not threaten any white group.
It does not claim any territory. 

It appears more of wishful thinking.];W[ef]
(;B[hg]C[White already claims a huge territory in the top left, and a secure corner in the bottom right. 

Black has only a very small territory in the bottom left. Move 25 is much to passive for this stage.]
;W[lg];B[lf];W[kg];B[jg];W[jh]TR[fg][hg][jg]C[The three marked stones did not achieve territory for black, nor save the two stones in the top left. 

Always try to have a plan on what you try to gain];B[ih];W[jf]
;B[ig];W[ji]LB[jf:A];B[if]LB[jf:A]C[Black 35 is correct locally but it is not urgent. It cost black in sente which is worth much more. 

A does not threaten anyone.];W[mf];B[me];W[mg];B[ld];W[gb];B[hb]

(;B[eh]C[You were wise not to answer white!
White 52 is very small.];W[bm];B[cl];W[eg];B[cm]C[This is small, it also gives up sente. 
Continue with the good attack you started at the middle!];W[ei]

C[The game is pretty much over now.];B[bg]C[This is not a bad move. 
But it stood a chance before the border was so secure];W[bh]
