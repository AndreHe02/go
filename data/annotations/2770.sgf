C[buckyyowza: Hello, comments by Mark Fyffe.  I am currently 4k* on IGS, and so found this game quite challenging to review... I think you are a bit stronger than 8k ;-)  Nonetheless I hope that you find my comments to be of use.  Certainly feel free to ask if you have any further questions about this game.  Comments end at 204, where I feel that black had decisively lost the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[qj];B[fq]TR[dj][cn]C[buckyyowza: This is asking for trouble :-)  On only move 7, you are starting a battle inside of white's sphere without much to immediately back it up.  In general black will want to play more defensive in the opening and build a strong base while white will want to be more aggressive and maintain the initiative.  No matter how this corner plays out, it seems that the stone at F3 will only help white counteract the influence gained by black's other opening plays.  I'd prefer to play this stone at c6 or d10.]
;W[hq]TR[cn]C[buckyyowza: see var and comments at b11 for how to respond.  another good choice would be c6, and to leave f3 as a sute ishi (sacrificed as good aji).]

(;B[fo];W[dn];B[ip]TR[cq]SQ[qj][dn][fo]C[buckyyowza: this joseki gains influence for black, but little in the way of gained moyo against a side, which is what black needs now.  This is an excellent joseki to play if, for example, black has some shape already in the lower right. I would have played at c3 instead of f5 to get fast shape to follow up f3.  Remember, the san ren sei formation at the top is very thick, but d6 and r10 prevent you from turning that thickness into center moyo, so try to keep your focus more on the sides and corners.  see var on b7 for other joseki ideas that may fit this opening a little better.  truly it all boils down to f3 was not a good play!  it helps white at every turn ;-)]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[iq];B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[gp]TR[lq]C[buckyyowza: this is greedy, white should play m3 first to ensure safety (and finish the joseki!)]

(;B[fp]LB[qn:3][go:1][kq:2]C[buckyyowza: I would prefer to play g5, then l3 and r6 if w completes the connect (see var).  Although the fight here is possible, it is better to keep a bigger presence on the board than to squabble over a local area, unless that area is quite large or holding things together.  As it turns out, you end up losing this fight but it could go either way, especially since white makes some mistakes along the way.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[io];W[fn];B[gm];W[eo];B[kq]
(;W[kr]TR[eq]C[buckyyowza: now white and black both have 4 liberties, but black's k4 stones have quite enough to live.  I think white should attack the black stones around f3 now, at e3 (see var) for a better chance of winning this fight. there is not space for sabaki here, l2 gives sente to black so that he may find room to breathe.]
;B[lr];W[jr];B[gr];W[mr]TR[er]C[buckyyowza: white is dead now, and this cut does not appear to work.  It seems that white should lean in from e2 for a sente play that uses the aji instead of destroying it.]
;B[ls];W[hr];B[dr]C[buckyyowza: good :-)];W[cr]
(;B[hs]C[alpha6789: This is the bad move. I think I
should play
at L1 or J1, then white maybe dead. Is that right?

buckyyowza: right, j1 kills white easily.  l1 does not, see variations.]
;W[ks];B[mq];W[is];B[cq];W[dq];B[br];W[er];B[cs];W[eq];B[es]
C[buckyyowza: this is overplay.  This is already a fighting game, so it is best to leave this aji for later fights.]
;W[fr];B[qn]TR[oj]C[buckyyowza: good, although I'd lean toward playing the cap at p10 instead.  I think r6 is equivalent but more complicated.]
;W[rp];B[on];W[oq];B[qh]TR[fm][np]C[buckyyowza:  black is too bloodthirsty :-)  The white stone at r10 is not that strong now, and certainly does not need to be killed for black to win from here.  Now, you must protect against white extending from the solid base in the lower right corner.  o4 should handle this nicely.  Also, any time is a good time to strike at f7 for an enourmous gain in influence.]
;W[oj];B[oh];W[mj];B[mh];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[no]TR[fm]SQ[on][qn]CR[hn]C[buckyyowza: now white is starting to take control of the game.  white's center line extensions at p10 and n10 make the lower right much stronger, and also pull h6 back into play. black's stones at p6 and r 6 are starting to look helpless, but there is still quite a bit of space in the upper side and upper left.  f7is becoming quite important now, see var.]

(;B[nn]TR[mm]C[buckyyowza: oh no!  these stones are running into a white wall.  it is better to break your aji out by giving them a place to run first.  without a clear escape route, this sort of play becomes hamari gatachi (a failed strategy).  Even if the black stones escape, white gets further into black's moyo. When escaping it matters little if some stones are cut, in fact you will often need to sacrifice a stone or two to get out.  try n7 for a more sensible way out that minimizes the influence of white's center line dragon.]
;W[mn];B[mo];W[oo];B[mm];W[ln];B[lm];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[jm]
C[alpha6789: This is also bad. I think I should play
at J6 so that the black group will not be dead
later.

buckyyowza: j6 is no use.  it prevents black from becoming enclosed, but white can be killed from here if careful. if j6, white will run all over the remaining black potential (much like what happens in the actual game).  Since your attacks in white's sphere were only marginally successful, it is best to clean up the l3 group and protect against attacks against your own areas.]
;W[in]
(;B[np]TR[mp]CR[hl][nr]C[alpha6789: This is too bad. If I played at H7, maybe
I still can catch the white.

buckyyowza: this play should be at n4, then o2 and h8 become miai for black.  I prefer h8 to h7 because it leaves less good aji for white, but it takes no liberty. h7 seems reasonable now, but it is also quite a complicated kill, and white will likely take the entire right side in exchange for it.]
;W[hm];B[hl];W[il];B[fm];W[en];B[hk];W[im]
(;B[ik]TR[jj]C[buckyyowza: I think that k10 here will more effectively trap the white stones. This play just keeps the battle going in white's favor, allowing him a chance to connect the two dragons and destroy black's position in the entire lower right.]
;W[jl];B[lk];W[kk];B[lj];W[kj];B[ki];W[lo];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq]
;W[jj];B[kl];W[jk];B[ji];W[ij];B[hi]TR[cj][nm]C[buckyyowza: white is out, and the lower side is dead. there is little point in continuing to fight at this point.  there is a lot of aji from the m3 group remaining, so it would be best to protect the connection at o7 or develop the left side with something like c10.  the h9 and g7 triangle shapes are heavy and cumbersome to manage, but all in all if you just take good care of what you already have it is enough to win.]
;W[ii];B[ih];W[hj]
(;B[nr]TR[ch][gi][om]C[alpha6789: I am really stupid. Time is not enough. this is the thank-you move. useless.
I should play at R3.

buckyyowza: r3 is also no use (see var).  p7 is a good choice to seal the right side.  I would also consider what is happening to the left side with some alarm, and perhaps play c12 or g11 to avoid too much trouble there. see var  for how white can break up the right side now]

TR[kg][fk]C[buckyyowza: this is no use, you do not threaten white or protect black.  this is just inviting white to invade further. play l13 or f9 now for more points without all this hassle.]

problem.

TR[pb]C[buckyyowza: this is 3 step gote, so clearly not a good ko threat. q18 more efficiently threatens this corner.  all in all, black does not appear to be in a good position to fight a ko, and should not have started one.]

make eyes.];W[fj]C[alpha6789: I think those stones are as big as

buckyyowza: the stones are bigger, they are worth about 20 points, the left side is worth about 10. see var on 196.]

buckyyowza: yes, this leads to ko, see var.]
(;W[fg]C[alpha6789: maybe I should play at F14. However, I
was behind too much, and I cannot catch up.

buckyyowza: yes, i count that the best black can do now is lose by about 20 so I will end my review here.  Thank you for a chance to look over this game, it was quite a challenge!  As I said, I think you are a bit stronger than IGS 8k, probably more like 6k, so I hope that my comments have been useful enough ;-)   All in all I saw a few major flaws in your play that may help you progress to the next level:

1) You are too eager to kill something.  Your opening consisted of three sound fuseki plays and then provoking a large scale battle.  Every chance you had to play honte and accept that you were ahead for now, you would instead play tenuki and attack something else.  As a result you ended up spread too thin and your position fell apart like a house of cards.

2) Do not be greedy.  Despite white's better fighting in this game, you kept a significant potential essentially blocked off throughout the game, but it seemed that you wanted everything white had as well.  This is sure sign of not counting ;-)  Even in a fast game (which I gather this was), there is always a minute to check the score as you see it.  Once you get a feel for what you have and how much it is worth, you will find the timing to go from the attack to the defense.

3) Keep it simple. Straight away, black was divided into several small groups.  Although black had a powerful influence on the upper side, none of these groups could run to it, so many of them died.  This ties into my other two points as well:  it is easier to defend a few areas than many, and also easier to count.

Thanks again for a chance to look over this game. To improve, I'd suggest you spend a bit more time studying fuseki.  http://www.gobase.org/ has an excellent library of pro games organized by fuseki that can illustrate better how certain openings are used . It would also help to study tesuji problems, a few better placed stones could have made all the difference in this game.  Try http://www.goproblems.com for some excellent problems including fuskei and tesuji. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me via email or look for bucky on IGS.]
