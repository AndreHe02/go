C[Hi,

I'm playing black.

I think I realise 2 or 3 of my main mistakes but it would be helpful to see if you agree and to see some of my smaller mistakes.

Thanks for the review!

Balladeer: Well, Q10 wasn't the biggest point at the moment you played it, but that wasn't a big mistake, but missing F5 was too bad, taking it would have put you in the lead early in the game...

Like it is now, there is some aji in the white bottom left group, but not much, but your right side territory is still wide open, and there is some bad aji top right... see variation.]

;B[oa]C[From here on the ensuing fight is bad for white, so I don't think white should have cut, he should have lived instead and let you cover the cutting point, and then take sente to play H17]

(;B[rg]C[see variations];W[qi];B[rj];W[sh]C[ndkrempel: I played this sequence planning to push and cut at Q13.

This would capture one of the white groups and leave white's corner requiring another move to live.

Sadly I reread and misread at this stage so tenuki'd, oops!

The next move (tenuki) is the first major mistake that I can see?
