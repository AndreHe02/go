C[I'm not great at 9x9 games as my tactics are a bit rusty and 9x9 is almost all tactics -- life and death and tesuji.  I'll do my best and go through lots of variations.

Final comments at end.];B[cc]C[Calloused [16k\]: Hello

-----

3-3 opening should secure the corner for Black.];W[fg]C[pawelek [19k?\]: Hi!

---

3-4 opening.  This is pretty common for 9x9.];B[gc]LB[ec:A]
C[So far, I think I'm doing the right things

---

I'm not so sure.  Black has theoretically locked up the corners, but has left a big vulnerable point at A where a cut is possible.]
;W[cf]C[
White takes another 3-4 point.  The ogeima shimari will be tougher to cut than Black's wall, but it's smaller.]
;B[ee]LB[bd:C][dd:B][fd:A][he:E][hf:D]C[Trying to stake out some space.  I wonder if maybe c5 would have been a better play here

---

Black may be staking out space but is not putting any pressure on White.  Black should look for places where it's possible to both whenever the opportunity presents itself.

C5 looks too close to White to me.  I would have probably played D or E to build strength and attack at the same time.  Black now has serious vulnerabilities at A and B.  Also, a White move to C looks both natural and profitable.]
;W[dd]C[Now I'm worried about my C7 stone

---

C7 is still guaranteed life at this point.  What is threatened is E5 and the connection between C7 and G7.

White seems to be confident he can live, so he's trying to cut Black's more vulnerable structure apart, hoping to profit by killing some stones or forcing a retreat.]
;B[ce]C[Trying to stake out some space and connect at C6.  I think playing on lines 7-9 would be too passive and yield the bottom half of the board to White]
;W[de]C[I'm not too worried about this, since I can connect my stones easily]
;B[cd]C[If I don't do this now, I'm worried I never will];W[ef]
C[Tiger mouth at D4.  Already I'm feeling like White has the upper hand

---

At this point, I'd say White is in a substantially stronger position.  He's taken the offensive and is attacking while making territory.  Black doesn't have much firm territory yet and has positions that are still weak.]
;B[ge]LB[fe:A]TR[ee]C[Trying to expand on the left.  Maybe I should have played D7

---

The problem here is that Black is still open for attack at A.  White can damage Black severely if he plays there.]
;W[fe]C[He keeps cutting my stones.


---

As I pointed out earlier.  This is pretty devastating for Black.]

(;B[ed]C[Maybe F6 would have been better

---

Let's see.  I was wondering this as well.  See previous move's variations.  I don't think f6 is overall favorable.]
;W[fd]C[Not good for me

---

Yes. White is running Black all over the place.  Black is making no thickness or territory and White is poised to strike at weakness after weakness.]
;B[ec]C[I'd like to connect my stones ... I'm really getting worried about all the little islands

---

Black can now connect out with your middle stones.  White has sente and his choice of weak points.]
;W[fc]LB[gd:A][be:C][gf:B]C[This is not bad for White.  Other possibilities include the marked points.]

(;B[dc]C[Maybe F8?

---

No.  This is better.  See variation from previous move.];W[df]
C[His stones were in atari, so he had to play this.

---

Yes.  This might be a good time for Black to shore up the weak stones on the right.]
;B[fb]TR[fc][fd][fe]C[Now I'm thinking about trying to create two eyes in the upper left

---

The upper left is fine; barring errors it's alive as far as I can see.  It's the _right_ Black needs to be concerned with.  

This is not a bad move.  White's marked group is short on liberties, making this cap effective.]
;W[gd]TR[ge]C[My G5 stone is in trouble.  I probably should just abandon it.

---

Yes.  The situation is serious but not all bad for Black.

It _looks_ bad, but note that White gains no liberties with his last move.]
;B[hd]C[But didn't

---

Atari, attacking and forming some (weak) territory.  This is a good move, if Black is willing to let G5 go.]
;W[ff]C[At this point White has one big group with no eyes.  That's not good for White, I think

---

White is not going to have a problem living with this configuration.]

(;B[he]LB[hb:A]TR[ge]C[I should be making eyes somewhere on the upper part of the board or connecting at G8

---

Critical, possibly fatal mistake.  Black should have let the marked stone go and played at A.  This would have locked the upper left.

See variation from previous move for how it could have gone from here.]
;W[gb]C[Too late.  I think my game really went downhill from here]

(;B[hc]C[H8 might have been better

---

Not sure about that.  See variation from previous move.];W[eb]
C[Cutting again.  I need to protect my cutting points better]

(;B[ga]LB[hb:A]C[Maybe I can capture G8 and create two eyes in the upper right?

---

A would have been far better.  Black probably could have lived.

White would be wise to respond at A since Black failed to play here.]

(;W[fa]C[Didn't even see that coming.];B[ha]LB[hb:A][hg:B]C[Now I'm starting to get lost and my game is falling completely apart.  I lost the initiative (sente?) some time back and now I'm starting to play randomly it seems

---

Yes, this move is wasted.  A would probably have been better, or B.]
;W[hb]C[The G9 and H9 stones are dead.]
(;B[ic]LB[ib:A][hg:B]TR[id][ie][hf][if][ig][hh][ih]C[Thinking about trying to stake out the marked area for two eyes.  This  was wishful thinking.

---

A (or B) would have been better.  See variation from previous move.]
;W[hg]C[Now I don't think I can make two eyes anymore

---

Good move by White.  This was huge.];B[hf]C[A silly move - no way to live here]
;W[gg]C[At this point I feel I should have resigned.  The rest of the game was pretty pointless.]
;B[da];W[be];B[bd];W[bf];B[ae]LB[ig:A];W[af];B[ad]C[Here I started to feel better - maybe I could live in the top left after all.  I'm not sure how to do this.

---

I think it can be done but Black would have to have preserved an outside liberty.]
;W[bb]C[I'm guessing this kills my chance at making two eyes.

---

I don't think so, but I'm not sure.];B[db];W[ia]C[Pointless move by White.]
;B[ea]C[Pointless waste of an outside liberty.  I can't see a way to live now.]
;W[fb];B[ab]C[I think this is completely futile];W[ba]C[Yes, I cannot find a winning variant.  Black would need at least one outside liberty to survive here.]

(;B[aa];W[ac];B[ag]C[And I resigned

---

Not a terrible game by any means.  Black made some suboptimal play at the beginning but nothing really fatal.  Critical mistakes late in the game were the real factor.

The misplay on move 23 was the real game decider here.  You have to be willing to sacrifice an overextended stone at times.  Often you can still profit from it even after you have mentally "let it go".

I would recommend Black study some life and death problems and work on connecting groups, defending connections and making life.  Knowing how to attack _and_ make territory at the same time will vastly improve Black's game.]
