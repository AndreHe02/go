AB[pd][dp];W[ed]C[bridges: I was tempted to approach this stone, but decided that I was better off staking a claim of some sort on the bottom right instead.

Kirkmc: I was counting on you to approch it, and when you did'nt it was even better.

SGF:  B should not approach this move when the is an open corner.  B should follow the usual order of corners before shimari or kakari.]
;B[pp];W[qn]LB[nc:a]C[SGF: This move is definitely not wrong, but I would play at 'a' to work with W1.]
;B[nq];W[rp];B[qq];W[cd]LB[qk:a][ql:b]C[SGF: W should finish the joseki at 'a'. If W does not finish it a B pincer at 'b' is severe.  This shimari is not urgent.  In fact, as the stronger player, W should welcome a kakari by B as it would give him a chance to complicate the game.]
;B[qk]LB[ql:a]C[Kirkmc: That was big, but I knew you would do it.  I got the corner, so it was a fair trade.

SGF: First, B shuold be at 'a', which threatens immediately to conect ot B2.  Secondly, W cannot get the corner is B plays correctly and W should end up drifting in the middle without eyes.]
;W[rl]LB[rq:a][rr:b][qp:c][pq:d][po:e]C[Kirkmc:  This should have been at R13

SGF:  No, W must settle the group quickly.  W cannot afford to lose a group so easiliy in a handicap game. Wa, Bb, Wc, Bd, We is the easy way to do this.]
;B[qh]C[SGF:  This seems timid, but given that B is taking a handicap perhaps it is acceptable.]
;W[dj]LB[qo:a][ro:b][pn:c][on:d][cn:e]C[SGF:  Once again W has abandoned the group before settling it.  If B now plays Ba, Wb, Bc white is confined to the edge and is still not alive, while B has a strong outside position.  W should play 'd'.  Also, on the left, W11 is too slow for a handicap game.  'e' is correct.]
;B[jd]LB[dm:a][cm:b][jp:c][cn:d][gc:e][jc:f][je:g]C[bridges: Here, I was debating between A, B, and C, as well as move 12. I decided that 16 game me a nice double-wing up top, and prevented him from doing the same.  However, it left my stone at the bottom somewhat vulnerable.

SGF:  Your thinking is correct, but you must also consider the follow up moves your opponent has.  In this case, W has a nice follow up move at 'd', but B does not  have a nice followup move at the top ('e'e looks a little cramped).  Also, W would like to increase his moyo in fornt of his shimari (left) instead of beside it (top) so there is something to be said for playing 'b', which threatens to undercut W on the left.  At the top I think that 'f' is better than the move played. at it has a nice followup at 'g'.  My first choice would be 'b', my second would be 'f'.]
;W[fq]LB[cn:a][cm:b]C[Wrong side.  W should be delighted to expand his left side with 'a'.  This move just forces B to play 'b' which undercuts W's side.]
;B[cn]LB[ip:a][iq:b][cm:c][eq:d]C[bridges: I figured that E3 would just force him to stabilize his stones. Even though it gave me a better hold on the corner, I figured I would like to be able to hold an  extension from O3 in reserve. Perhaps a pincer here would have worked well,  perhaps at A, or B. I didn't really consider this much at the time.

kirkmc: The pincer was what I was hoping for, and I would have followed up ot C6.

SGF:  This move should be at 'a'. 'd' was mentioned by bridges.  It should not even occur to him as it is only appropriate when B has a stone in place at the bottom to prevent a W extension.  An extensino from B4 would be wrong as the B group at the right is stable for the time being.  A pincer would allow W to play the move he should have played in the first place: 14]
;W[iq]LB[dr:a][cq:b][eq:c][fp:d][jq:e][cm:f]C[If W is going to make only a 2 space extension he must exchange 'a' for 'b' first.  Without this exchange B can exchange 'c' for 'd' and make W overconcentrated: that is, if B plays 'c' first then W extends to 'e', so 15 is wrong.  Also, when B plays the small knights move at 14 it is standard to play 'a' because it leave B feeling a little overconcentrated in the corner, whereas is B make a large knights move at 'f' the slide to 'a' is bad because B gets a much better shape.]
;B[kq]LB[eq:a][fp:b][dr:c]C[bridges: Keep the white stones cramped and make space for myself .

SGF: Not true.  B should exchange 'a' for 'b' first to achieve this aim.  As is it, if B slides to 'c' he is pretty much settled.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[fo]LB[hc:a][on:b]C[SGF: Unnecessary - this group is stable now.  There is a big point at 'a', but coming out at 'b', stabilizing the W stones, is bigger.]
;B[dl]LB[cl:a][cr:b][bj:c]C[bridges: I wanted to make sure I didn't get hemmed in too closely to the edge, and didn't give him this extension, or one to A.

Kirk:  I think A would have been better.

SGF: B is thinking along the right lines.  A W play at 'a' is pretty miuch sente (threatening 'b' is B ignores it).  B could also consider 'c' to stop W from sealing off the side.  The problem with the high play at 20 is that it does not threaten the left side too much.]
;W[hd]LB[hc:a]C[SGF: 'a'  is better.];B[md]LB[oc:a][jf:b]C[SGF:  This does not secure anything. 'a' secures the center and makes a nice relationship with B12.  B can also consider 'b']
;W[ic]LB[jc:a][qc:b][fj:c]C[SGF: Very bad.  At the very least W should play 'a', but both of these moves make B pretty secure at the top. Now that B has played 22 W should consdier invading at  'b'.  'c' is another good point which enlarged W's moyo.]
;B[jc];W[ck]LB[fj:a]C[This has very little effect upon B.  'a' is better.]
;B[cl]LB[dm:a][cr:b][er:c]C[B does not need to play here as he can answer 26 with 'a'.  Playing at 'b' is better, securing the corner and  anticiapting 'c' is an attack on the W stones are the bottom were ever to develop.]
;W[jb];B[kb];W[ib]LB[dh:a][fh:b][gf:c][if:d][lc:e][dc:f][ci:g]
TR[cd][ed]C[bridges: At this point, I like the looks of things so far, except for the big white territory on the upper left. Not really knowing what to do about it, I debated with jumping right in A, B, or C, extending to D, or squeezing the group on the bottom right. Not knowing quite what to
do after A, B, or C, and not liking how much solid territory D gave white while I was still pretty open, I chose to attack the white stones at the bottom right. A related question: Where are the standard invasion points on the marked corner enclosure?

Kirk: D17 is where you need to invade, but I think it is tough to live against that, especially considering the stones that are very thick in the middle.

SGF:  First of all, B should protect the cut above 28 by playing 'e'.  This also help B is W tries to invade the top right corner.  B really should not be worrying abourt the  W territory in the upper left.  He can match it at the ujpper right and he is better on the rest of the board.  As far as invading the upper left is concerned, 'f' could not be expected to work after W has strengthened himself with 23-29.  The terrirory at the top is secure.  B can reduce the side though by starting at 'g' as shown in the variation for the next move.]

(;B[on]LB[ci:a][rq:b][lc:c]C[SGF: The variation at 'a' answers the questions asked on the previous move.    This move 30 is in the wrong direction.  Locally 'b' is better, taking the corner and forcing W to either run or live on the side.  As it is W can settle himself easily and B30 gains little.  From a whole board perspective B can probably simplify the game best by playing 'c', leaving 'a' and 'b'b as miai.]
;W[pm]LB[rq:a]C[SGF: This is pointless.  Moving out will only strength B.  W should play 'a' to settle himself on the edge.]
;B[ok]LB[rq:a]C[SGF: Now that B30 is on the board, a play at 'a' would be very severe.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[fk]LB[ej:a][fj:b][ci:c][he:d][kc:e][qc:f][ng:g]
C[bridges: Now White's territory is getting quite large...

Kirkmc: Yes, and I was hoping that my moyo would be bigger than yours.  I should have played something in your moyo now, around O13, and turned it into a fight.  I would have had more of a chance.

SGF:  This move leaves a weakness at 'a' for B to exploit.  it should be at 'b'.  B can still invade at 'c' as shown earlier so W's moyo is not yet territory.  B can play at 'd' to flatten the moyo some.  I would say the game is still even after the exchange at the bottom left.  Don't forget B's weaknesses at 'e' and 'f'.  For W to try to reduce the moyo with a move at 'g' as suggested is counterproductive.  Such a move would like lose the corner invasion and also too deep, being inside the sector line formed by B12 and B32.]
;B[if]LB[kc:a][ej:b][ek:c][dk:d][ei:e]C[bridges: But my right side is big too, and even though this gives white a nice big territory on  the left, it also sketches me out a larger territory.

SGF:  This is the right direction, and alos indirectly reinforces the cut at 'a'.  It is also a ladder break after the sequence Bb, Wc, Bd, We]
;W[gf];B[ih];W[qc]C[bridges: not unexpected.

SGF:  But too late. B has too much on the outside now.  This move had to come earlier.  MAybe instead of W35]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf]LB[ob:a][rb:b]C[Because of B's strength around here it is doubtful whether W could live if B played 'a'.  The invasion came too late.  W's best change of living is to play 45 at 'b' an fight a ko.  B probably would not want to risk losing the ko and would probably let W live.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[jo]LB[lj:a]C[SGF:  These stones are stable for the time being so this move is just a territory move. A move at 'a' would be better.  Notice that 'a' is outside the sector line formed by B32 and 38]
;B[ko];W[jn];B[kn]LB[ej:a]C[brdiges.: Didn't know what else to do. I can't let him play L6, and I figured I could push up some from the left side...

SGF: This is OK, although a W play here is not as bad as it seems.  B has some excellent moves against W's moyo at the upper left as should earlier so he can afford to take this saefty route,  However, I woulsd like to see B play 'a' before W protects.]
;W[gh];B[hj]C[bridges: This was probably a mistake. White would have done well with L7 or K8 at this point, giving me some difficulty. It also asks white to reinforce an area where he was somewhat thin.

Kirk: IMHO, this was a fine move.

SGF:  This is fine.  If B does not take it W will.];W[gj]LB[jk:a]
[jm:b]C[SGF:  Too defensive.  W cannot win this way.  He must play to reduce the moyo.  I would consider 'a' before b gets 'b']
;B[jm]C[bridges: but I got here first. Whew.

SGF:  W lost his chance.  The game will be very difficult now.]
;W[im];B[il];W[jl];B[km];W[hl];B[ik];W[hn];B[em];W[hk];B[ij]
;W[fm];B[om];W[pl];B[pk]LB[cr:a][jr:b][bk:c][rj:d]C[SGF:  The game is effectively over.  There are a few big points ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd' )  but nothing big enough to chance the outcome.  B has no weak stones or W to attack and that is the key.]
;W[rj]
(;B[ri]LB[rk:a]C[brdiges: Didn't know quite what to do about this. My first instinct was S9, and then maybe S10. In fact, that's what I had inteded, but then played this instead.

Kirk: I think your first instinct would have been better.

SGF:  W is living dangerously.  See the variation at 'a'.  B should definitely push once at 'a' before doing anything else.  To let W play 'a' is too much.]
;W[rk];B[qj];W[ol];B[nl];W[br];B[bq]LB[cr:a][cs:b]C[SGF: B must exchange 'a' for 'b' first.  Letting W get 'a' loses a lot of points.]
;W[cr];B[bk];W[bj];B[dk]LB[bl:a][cj:b][aj:c]C[SGF: B can play this later and should just connect at 'a'.  By leaving 'b' unplayed B has move of a threat when he plays 'c'  This threat may be enough to stop W from blocking 'c'.]
;W[cj];B[al]C[SGF: The solid connection is better.];W[en];B[dn]
;W[el]LB[dm:a][ek:b]C[bridges: White taking doesn't get him very far in, and I don't want him to seal me in nice and small with Ba, Wb.

SGF:  'b' is better.  This allows B to play 'b' himself.];B[ek]

;B[na];W[pa];B[pn];W[qo];B[sj];W[sk];B[si]LB[ql:a]C[SGF:  Should play 'a' first.]
;W[ql];B[is];W[hs];B[js]C[Patrick: Didn't think white needed to back up here, but I didn't see any other big sente moves. J16, I guess.]
;W[gr]C[SGF: Why play this?  It is minus 1 point in gote.];B[ja]
;W[ia];B[ka];W[oa];B[ma];W[ra]C[SGF: Before this exchange B could have played at 153 in sente to gain profit.  See any tesuji book.]
;B[id];W[he];B[sd];W[sc];B[se];W[sq];B[qr];W[el]LB[qa:A]C[Patrick: I thought about fighting this. I had an obvious threat at A. I decided to let it be, however.]
;B[dm];W[fl];B[tt];W[tt];C[Kirk: I played too submissively, and missed the chance to reduce your moyo.  I have learned that I need to fight against weaker players, whose fighting strength will  be a bit lower.  I am not used to giving handicaps, so I generally lose them.]
