C[First, many thanks for reviewing my game. I played black, and lost horribly. I think that my loss was mainly due to a fight that started due to an invasion at move 36, but I feel that I misplayed at various other bits of the game too.

Erik:
Thanks for letting me review your game.  My commets will be preceded by Erik: .
All in all I feel that your opening play was what cost you the game.
In particular the expansion of the lower right corner,both moves, was small and cost you a lot.
I also feel that you overestimate the territorial value of your wall against the upper left corner.  Thus allowing white to come along way towards neutralizing this wall.
I hope my review of your game is useful.];B[pp];W[pd];B[dp]
;W[cd];B[ed];W[ec]
(;B[fd];W[dc]
(;B[df]C[Erik:  
I feel that this is too loose.
There are defects in blacks shape, and white gets a large corner and can expand along the top.  Neither can black expect to be able to close the side.]
;W[bf]
(;B[ch]C[Should I have bothered with C12, or should I have played somewhere like K4 or K16 and the like?

Erik:
I feel that the sequence played strongly favors white.
And giving up sente seems bad.
OTOH without a stone around C12 then black has not got anything out of this, and his stones in the area might quickly become weak.
Other people I have talked to seems to think that it's an aceptable result for black so it(the sequence) might not be so bad.
D12 was suggested in stead of C12 this seems better as since you avoid the weakness created by the knights moves.
A play at F17(for black) or g17/g18(for white) is huge, so white should most likely not tenuki here.]

;B[cq];W[iq]

Erik: Yes.  This is a largely meaningless move.];W[qj];B[qm]
C[Erik: A bad move,as your corner is still open to invation]

(;B[om];W[pg];B[jd];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc]
(;B[id];W[mc];B[ce]C[I think this move was wrong, as I am overconcentrated. Is this correct?

Erik: I agree that this move was bad.  But the reason that it is bad has more to do with the fact that white too gets stronger than with overconsentration.
OTOH there will be fighting in the center, so you might get more out of your strength than white will from his.]
;W[be];B[dd]C[Erik: aji-keshi.];W[cc];B[fc];W[fb]
(;B[jb]C[Erik: you don't have time to play this.
Also it is small. White is strong on both sides and can not connect.  So cutting is largely meaningless.
See variation.];W[gj]C[I would appreciate any comments you may have on how I could have handled his invasion better. I think that this invasion was the major thing that lost me the game.

Erik:
Due to the openess of blacks position I would hesitate to call this an invasion.  Dealing with these kind of moves largly comes down to prevention, when the move is played is frequently too late.
That beeing said it definitly puts white ahead in the game, and black has to get some compensation from attacking this stone if he is to have any chance of winning this game.]
;B[go]C[I was trying to build up strength to attack the invading stone by playing the next few moves

Erik: That seems to be the right idea.];W[kr]
(;B[kp]C[Erik: but this move does the opposite, as it forces white to play stones towards conecting his stones.]
;W[io];B[im]C[Erik: This stone is not connected to g5.
For that reason I think h7 would have been better.];W[ij];B[kk]
TR[hd][jl][hn][fo]C[Was this too early to attack his stones?

Erik: attack any later and you don't have anyt good way to attack.
