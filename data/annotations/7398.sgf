C[Hi my name is Brett Lee and I played black in this game. As you can see the player is an 11k ans 7 ranks higher than me. Due to this i think i played a little scared. I lost by 32.5 but i think for my rank this is ok. I really want to become stronger a high dan by the end of the year. I would like to use this game as a stepping stone on my way to becoming stronger. Thank you so much for reviewing this game. You can email me at usfgoclub@gmail.com for any questions Have a great day Thank you

Mark: Hi Brett!  My name is Mark Schlatter (mschlat on KGS and DGS).  I'm about 7 kyu and I'll try to help you with your questions and point out where you can improve.  My focus will be on larger concepts when possible, since that's where I believe most players can improve the most.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ce]LB[oc:A][qo:B]C[Mark: An aggressive start for you --- rather than deciding to finish off a corner (say at A or B), you decide to go for an opponent's corner.]
;W[fd];B[ch];W[cm]
(;B[ck]C[I was worried that this was a bad shape but he let me play it fairly well. is there a better way?

Mark: My concern is that you now have "thin next to thin" --- that is, two two-space jumps next to each other.  This group probably won't die, but it can be reduced easily and face pressure from the white groups on the side.  See the variation.]
;W[nc]
(;B[oc]LB[lc:B][qg:A]C[Is this a bad move? what other variations are there?

Mark: Let's talk general moves first, then some specifics.  When your corner is approached, you typically have three options: extend (around A), pinch (around B), or attach (your move).  You typically only attach if you are able to put pressure on the white stone.  (Note that attaching violates the proverb "Never touch a weak stone".)  The variation shows a great time to attach.  Typically, I look at extending or pinching first.

However, in this case, your opponent has used an uncommon appproach.  The variations shows some possibilities that are also uncommon (but useful moves).]
;W[nd];B[od];W[jd]C[Mark: Here your attaching has helped white build a wall, and white gladly extends from it.]
;B[og]LB[ph:B][qh:A][qo:C]SQ[od][pd][qd]C[Mark: I see what I think you're doing here (extending from the top right).  However, since the right side isn't secured yet, I wouldn't play so high.  Since the wall is three points high (where we start counting from the third line), a good extension is three points away.  A is more secure, while B emphasizes the center more.

Note that I don't think this is the biggest move.  You already have a safe group in the top right, so I would probably play to secure the bottom right (C).]
;W[df]C[Mark: So here white starts reducing and flattening you out.  It's a frustrating place to be.]

(;B[cf]C[Mark: I've included some variations on how else to play besides the submission here --- note that all of them will probably lead to fighting.]
;W[dg];B[cc]C[i think this is a good move but was it too dangerous?

Mark: Yes!  No, not too dangerous (and as we've seen before) highly recommended.]
;W[dd]
(;B[cd]C[Mark: I explore in the variations whether you need to answer here --- I believe you do.]
;W[cj]
(;B[bj];W[ci];B[bi];W[dh];B[bg]LB[cg:A]C[Mark: Here just make the strong move at A.  I don't see any reason to let white have the forcing move at C13.]
;W[dk];B[dj]C[this was bad and started  my fall in the game.

Mark: No, this is a reasonable sacrifice.  While I'm still not sure this is the biggest area (what about the bottom right?), it's clear that white is building a large top and center.  Playing somewhere in there is a good idea.]
;W[di];B[dl];W[ek]
(;B[bl]C[Mark: This is the mistake --- connect at C8.];W[cl]
;B[bk];W[em];B[bm]C[Mark: This is not a huge move for black (not as big as the bottom right, bottom left, right side, or center) and doesn't help secure your left group (which is already safe).  Moreover, white responds by building a larger wall.]
;W[cn];B[fq]C[Mark: A difficult choice here.  I would have still emphasized the right hand side.]
;W[hq]C[Mark: And here's the pinch!];B[fo]C[Mark: Good!];W[ho]

(;B[hm]LB[gn:A]C[this was probably wrong but i can not see why. How should i have handeled it?

Mark: This has an easy cutting point at A.  The variations have some ideas.]
;W[gn];B[dq];W[eq]
(;B[cr]C[this is what killed the group i believe.

Mark: Well, I'm not sure what you want this move to do.  You do need to decide which stones are most important here, since your focus shifts from corner to center over the next few moves.  I've tried some variations to see how the atari at E2 (my preferred move) does.]
;W[er];B[cp];W[do];B[ep];W[fr];B[co];W[eo];B[hk]LB[hm:A]C[Mark: Note that your stone at A is not really crucial to the game now.  It might be used later to reduce the territory in the center, but I don't think there's a need to save it now.  Especially since you can save your group in the bottom left by connecting at B6.]

C[now there dead.

Mark: If you realize this in the game, it's time to abandon the group (that is, don't make moves like 69).]
;B[cq];W[fp];B[mq]C[Mark: Okay, good --- you've returned to the biggest area of the board (the bottom right).  However, you're extending towards a side where white already has a living group.  I'd play to emphasize the right hand side more (maybe Q5?).]
;W[kq];B[dn]C[Mark: But now you change focus from the bottom right and right hand side.  Moreover, while white has few liberties, they have an easy response to this move.]
;W[dm];B[ko]LB[pn:A]C[Mark: Side is larger than center --- a play around A is huge!]
;W[lp]LB[lo:B][mo:A]C[Mark: Moreover, as you see here, your new stone isn't connected to your base at the bottom. 

If you feel you need to play in this area, moves at A (the one space jump) or B (the knight's move) are safer.]
;B[mp];W[lo]TR[hk][hm][ko]C[i lost a lot of moyo here i was scared nd didnt protect my group well.

Mark: Technically, you don't yet have a group to protect yet --- the three marked stones are just stones, and all of them except L5 have some running room.  

This is a great opportunity to take more of the right hand side.]

(;B[ln];W[mo]C[Mark: See how your efforts to protect L5 start affecting your corner enclosure?  You lose more than you gain here.]

;W[jm];B[jl]LB[ne:B][ol:A]C[Mark: Okay, this is a good practice --- for defense, attach to a strong stone.  But is this the biggest move?  I like the hanes at A and B (which emphasize the side).]
;W[km];B[ll]LB[ji:B][kl:A]C[Mark: As shown in the variation, I'm not comfortable with this jump.  I'd rather see a strong move at A or a light move around B.]

;W[nf];B[oe];W[lf];B[mg];W[ld];B[nb]C[Mark: I think it's too early for this move --- better saved for endgame.  Morevoer, you've changed focus from the center stones to the edge.]
;W[mb];B[mc]C[Mark: And as you see, this does not work.];W[md]
;B[lb];W[ma]
(;B[la];W[lc];B[na]C[Mark: No --- this is just a move that means you have to come back and protect these two stones.  Much better just to connect at P18.]
;W[mc];B[ob];W[kb]C[Mark: I believe white wastes a move here --- there's no way I see to make these stones live.]

(;B[kg]TR[lf]SQ[mg]C[Mark: Okay, I see a pattern here --- you make moves that can be cut by the opponent's next move.  It happens here, move 107, move 75, move 43, and move 33.  Look carefully when you make two diagonal jumps or a one space jump next to an adjacent white stone.

If you want to extend into the center to save the middle stones, check the variations.]

Mark: You want you focus to be on saving some stones by sacrificing all of them --- if you try to save all, you lose all.  See the variation for more ideas.]

(;B[kj]TR[lj][kk]C[Mark: If you don't know the "empty triangle" proverb, it's time to learn --- always avoid this shape (unless of course the triangle is "full" with a stone at M9).  Also, this does not form an eye.]

Mark: You do a great job in tight circumstances, but note that white did have more effective moves available.  As I mentioned before, you can't save them all :-)

More seriously, some of your issues arise from playing too much in the center and not focusing on the side.  The three stones you saved were stones I'd give up if I could keep the large moyo on the right.]

[rs][ss]C[Thank you once again for the review I hope i didnt cause you too much trouble. i know my moves can be shallow sometimes.

Mark: No trouble at all!  Having a game reviewed is a great idea, and I hoped I helped.  Let me make some general comments.

1) I mentioned before the "cuttable moves" --- take a look at those and make sure you understand why white can cut easily.  Then, try to take those moves out of your play (unless, of course, you intend to sacrifice the stones).

2) Focus on corner first, then side, then center.  Your early moves in the center cost you when you had much easier (and more profitable) moves on the right hand side.

3) Look to get corner and side groups "out" --- that is, give them opportunites to affect the center.  You lost the lower left because you did not connect with the group above.  Your upper left was relatively small because you didn't move to the center.  Unless you are making a severe invasion for points that doesn't affect the health of other groups, you don't want to be "sealed in".

Feel free to ask more questions via email (mschlat@gmail.com) if you have them.]
