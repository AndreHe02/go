This is not a terribly urgent matter, with the white wall on the left it is unlikely that you will make much territory in the center.  A, B and C are all ideas here.]

Note that these are the same points that I suggested earlier to attack white.  Here, well into the endgame they are still important.  Both of these are huge point wise.]

Overall the game was very well played with only a couple of minor errors and the occasional mistake in the direction of play.  The biggest mistake I feel was not pressuring the white group on the right side at the beginning.]

(;B[bd]LB[fc:C][cd:B][be:A]C[now, depending on white's response you can either establish a base on the side or sacrafice the stone on C12 to take the corner for yourself.

It would also be possible to play at A, B or C to good effect.  A play at C would probably involve sacraficing on of the stones to establish a position on the side or corner for the other.]
