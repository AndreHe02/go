C[[krinid\] Hello.  I am 5k on KGS.  I'm playing black in a 2 handicap game vs. a 3k player.  White played three 3-3 invasions in the opening.  It was very surprising, but I did not mind because my understanding is that this is advantageous for black.  However, I found that white still had a strong game and brought the score within 6.5 points.  With such an advantageous opening, I feel I should have commanded the game instead of merely held my own for the win.  I feel there must be ways to punish white's play that I've missed.  Please show me where I missed chances to punish white's play.  Thanks in advance.]

(;B[bh]C[this is okay in this situation because you want to close off and protect your own group. however if your group isnt under any real threat of death from b11 or there isnt a really painful followup for you then you shouldnt just answer this way otherwise white will easiy win the endgame.

comments end here, i think the game is already decied and its only small endgame from here on.

hope it helps!];W[bn];B[bo];W[ao];B[ap];W[an];B[bq];W[dl];B[ek]

this would be the wrong side to block on.  You should always block on the wider side and because of where the l17 stone is building influence facing the top isn't too important]

this would be a bad move because of how close it is to the black wall... you want to use your wall to attack the white stone. You don't want him to run out in 1 move and then both your walls have no meaning]
