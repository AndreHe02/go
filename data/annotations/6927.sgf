C[Hello and thanks for review. Sorry my bad English, I'm not native speaker.

TH: Hi There, I've tried to focus the review on the major points that I believe you can improve on to make a big change to your game.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cp];B[eq];W[gq];B[eo]C[I dont really don't know how should I react to that pincer so decided to run to center

TH: This is a perfect continuation - but I worry slightly that you did not know how to react.

Try to be prepared at least one move ahead for any response to your approach move - look at a joseki book after each game that you felt confused in.
When you get to 10 kyu, you'll need to start learning a few common joseki.

A good free joseki guide is at http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm]

(;W[dq]C[TH: White plays a trick move, trying to connect underneath.]

(;B[co]C[white secures corner, so I decide to seal white in.

TH: not the best move, but reading ahead in a joseki can be difficult at your level.
Look at your stones - they could be separated easily.
On your move you *could* have separated white by playing D2.]

(;W[er];B[dp];W[cr];B[bp];W[cq]
(;B[em]TR[co][dp][eo]LB[bq:a][bo:b]C[TH: This is the first big mistake of the game.

The triangle stones are strong.
If white plays A you just play B and get even stronger.
(A would be a mistake by white)

Because the stones are strong you should not play near them - more stones there are a waste!
You should play far away from your stones, and tempt white to invade later - then you can use the strength against white.]
;W[bq];B[bn]C[TH: Because of E7 your stones look heavy now.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[qc]C[TH: White makes a mistake.
By playing Q17 you can force white to make small territory while you take good influence.]

(;B[nd]C[once again, I give corner to white and get influence to center

TH: This move gives white a big corner.
Look at the variations for joseki.];W[pc];B[qo];W[pj]C[TH: White gets an ideal reducing move.

This move was very good.
Look at it for a while - get a feel for how hard the stone is to attack - and how little territory black can get on the right now.]
;B[qj]C[TH: instead of fighting directly, it may be more urgent to play either N16 - to close white in - or K3 - to take a big territory point.]
;W[qk];B[pi];W[oj]LB[qi:a]C[TH: You must defend the cut at A

White can damage you by cutting - and may make easy life later.]
;B[oi];W[ni];B[nh]C[TH: The cut at R11 works now - see variation.]

(;W[nk];B[oh];W[jd]LB[jq:a][cf:b]C[TH: White gets a big point.

A and B are big points for black now.];B[dj]C[TH: Second really big mistake.

You played too close to your strong stones again.];W[cg];B[iq]
C[TH: A bit too close to the white stones maybe.
White could cause trouble at L3.];W[ip]
(;B[lq]C[TH: You sacrificed J3!];W[jq];B[mi];W[nj];B[hn]C[Trying to seal white in...

TH: This is another big mistake - again you play a stone too close to strong stones - this stone won't make any territory in the game and it doesn't take any territory either.

White's stones are strong and she doesn't need to react to this stone.]
;W[gc]C[Should I have playedto g17? Now White got upper side of board

TH: Yes, you should have played F17 earlier.

Now you can still reduce white by playing C17.
I can't tell whether it lives for sure or only gets a ko, though.]
;B[on]C[TH: This stone does not make territory - and it is not severe against White's P10 group.

White is almost safe because she can still cut at R11 or run.]
;W[fh]C[TH: White makes a big framework.];B[fj]LB[ld:a][kr:b]
[rj:c][ci:d][cc:e]C[TH: It looks like this move is a thoughtless reaction to white's last move.
You could make real points at A,B,C,D or E, but this move does very little, and white need not respond.]
;W[lk];B[ld]C[TH: ok.];W[kc];B[kf]C[TH: very passive.
You seem to be thinking "I'll make the right hand side into territory."

You forget that white can make a much bigger and more efficient territory with her next move.]
;W[if]
(;B[ki]C[TH: It looks like you are finally trying to put pressure on white's group.

You chose to play on the upper side, where you can't make much territory.
M6 makes more territory.];W[jj];B[ln];W[pm]
(;B[pn]C[TH: This move looks like an automatic response as well.
White can cut at R11 now and it works.]
(;W[om];B[nm];W[nl]
(;B[mm]C[TH: This move is not needed - white won't respond.
White will take a big point and win the game.];W[bj]C[TH: A very big move.]
;B[ck];W[mc];B[md];W[qd];B[od];W[oc];B[dh]C[I'm trying to reduce that huge white area upper left corner


TH: Play C17 instead.

You need to count.
White is at least 20 points ahead - so you need to make a BIG impact.
Invade!];W[dg];B[hk]C[TH: Small];W[lp];B[mp];W[kq]
(;B[lo]C[TH: Ignore the atari.];W[lr];B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[hi]C[TH: White and black have nothing to gain from this point.
White should cut at R11.];B[kl]C[TH: Again, this point has no value.

The game is clearly whites.

[sk][sl][sm]C[Any tips to improve my game?

TH: One thing was clear from your game - you played some stones that were not much better than passing.

I have to be severe about this - *do not play near strong stones*.

Also, do not play points in the endgame that are not sente and do not make territory. Look for the important sente moves.

Finally - when your opponent makes a moyo - invade it earlier - reduce it. Do not make it easy for her to make the whole thing into territory.
White's move 24 was a good example of an early moyo destroying move.
Later on, when you knew you should have played near G17 - this was your go instinct telling you you needed to invade earlier.

I hope this advice helps - in the next games you play, think about the advice every move: does this stone improve my position? Am I being too easy on my opponent?

Good luck!])
