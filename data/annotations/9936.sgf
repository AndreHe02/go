[cd:A]
(;B[cd]C[I prefer orthodox, but didn't want to risk white approaching anyways. I dislike that. Variation.

this move is good

(Joon)

okay
(LL)]
(;W[dp]LB[co:A][eo:B]C[Never seen this move before. From post-game review and study, it looks like he's saying he want the corner at any cost.
Any thoughts on how to respond?
(Joon)

this move is strange and bad
(LL)]
(;B[co]LB[eo:B][cp:A]C[Probably wrong direction.
(Joon)

yes, you should better go up
(LL)]
(;W[cp]C[this move is again very bad !
(LL)];B[eo]C[okay : the result is very good for black !
(LL)];W[cn]LB[ec:A][bo:B]C[strange move again by white
(LL)]
(;B[ec]C[At this point, I said whatever. The black stones likely aren't going to die, so I took my top corner.
(Joon)

this shape is good, but you have no reason to let white connect his stones on the lower side !
(LL)];W[bo]C[White uses another move. Let him take the corner if he wants it so bad, I'll take another big move.
(Joon)

okay : nevetheless, black has played three stones to do nothing, so the local result is good for white.
(LL)];B[op];W[pp]C[Again. Don't know why white is so fond of this.
(Joon)

???
(LL)];B[oo];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[mp]C[Protect my cutting point. Any better way to do this? I was thinking maybe M4. I disliked having to rely on a working ladder, though.
(Joon)

good shape
(LL)];W[kq];B[ip]C[Help E5 group and attack L3 stone. My biggest "worry" was if white jumped out. Probably G5 or such. O2 group seemed maneuverable enough.
(Joon)

okay
(LL)];W[iq];B[gp]C[Help E3 group
(Joon)];W[gq]LB[fp:A][hq:B]C[Thought this strange by white. Here I considered L4, but decided I wanted to establish solid safety for E3.

(;B[gs]C[The variation was my other option, but I didn't think white would let me scoop out the bottom.
(Joon)];W[fr];B[bp];W[dr]C[As I thought, white takes the bottom.
(Joon)];B[bn]C[good move
(LL)];W[hp];B[cm]C[Worked out decently for me. Good trade, I thought. White gets a bit of bottom, and I get a wall facing my shimari.
(Joon)

yes
(LL)];W[bq];B[ao];W[qm];B[om]C[Didn't see any need to be fancy. White gave me a reason to help my weak group.

of course, this move is natural

(Joon)

perhaps, but this move is okay
(LL)];W[qj]LB[jd:B][qk:A]
(;B[qk]C[In retrospect, White standing was probably the proper response. I would have extended down from Q16, then.
(Joon)

this move is small : you have no need to cut here
(LL)];W[pk]C[But white didn't.
(Joon)];B[pj];W[oj];B[pi];W[rk];B[ok];W[ql];B[nj]C[Crosscuts have been a favorite move of mine for the past month or so. I got a free wall out of this exchange. Nice.
(Joon)

yes : the result is good for black
(LL)];W[hc]LB[kd:A][oi:B]C[I considered leaning the other direction, but white clearly wanted the ladder break. Pincer works fine, anyways.
(Joon)]
(;B[kd];W[le]C[I guess white reeeaaally wanted the ladder break.

(;B[qc]C[Prevent 3-3 invasion, counter O17 aji. L14 looks stupid but works to counter L15 influence, so I guess it wasn't totally useless.

(Joon)

this is the proper move
(LL)];W[md];B[nc];W[mg]LB[dg:B][qi:A]
(;B[qi]C[Maybe small, but this assured a good chunk of side territory. Probably too small with the left wide open.
(Joon)

very small : you have to play somewhere in the west side !
(LL)];W[gf];B[dg]C[Gives me a reason to extend, which I planned on doing anyways.
(Joon)];W[em]LB[dm:A][dn:B]
(;B[dm]C[Thought this was bad move for white. Clearly trying to build center, but it solidified my connection and lessened the severity of a D10 ish invasion.
(Joon)];W[en];B[dn];W[ej];B[ci]C[Most profitable side. D6 group is alive and well, and I still have multiple center reduction moves.
(Joon)

okay

yes but this is not very big : a move around L11 or K7 would be better
(LL)];W[fl];B[dl];W[cj];B[bi]C[very small

okay
