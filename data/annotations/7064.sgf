;B[pd]C[Talpa [12k\]: ahoj
zetharx [12k\]: hi gg];W[cd];B[qp];W[dq];B[co];W[qc]C[rev: very bad move; white seals itself for about 10 points, while giving black very strong influence on the outside worth much more.


later in the game that move might be o.k. depending of the surrounding, but now its much to early]

[ep:D][nq:C]C[rev: much to close!

something arround A would be better;

yes, white might try to get into the area; but it would be a hard time to get something living giving black much more influence 

B: if you like the two stones

C-E other capabilities];W[gc];B[hb]C[rev: two mistakes:

1st  there are much bigger points than widenig you area by about 8 points or so

2nd  its too low and to close, white can use it to get stronger]

(;W[gb];B[hc];W[hd];B[id];W[gd];B[jb]C[rev: no, not necessary

yes, white can capture your 2 black stones,but 8 points compared to 20 that are still there by single stones!?]
;W[dh];B[cf]LB[ck:A]C[This seems in retrospect too deep in.  What would have been better?

rev: that stone is dead

A would have been better];W[cg];B[bh]LB[bg:A]C[rev: no, white can seperate your groups by playing at A ... and you can't defend both]
;W[bg];B[cj]LB[bh:A][cj:B][ck:C][co:D]C[too close, A can be captured easily by white, B does not help so C would be better as D is still alone]
;W[cl];B[bm];W[bl]C[rev: again 2 groups seperated ...];B[dk]
;W[dl];B[ei];W[eh];B[ef]LB[gg:A]C[rev: no, white can seal you in by playing at A,

there is no room for black to make a single eye here];W[bi]

;B[he];W[ge];B[gf];W[fd];B[if];W[fi];B[gi]C[rev:

wrong side; the upper group is VERY strong (even a 9DAN will not kill it) the group on the left is very weak ... so play on the weak side]
;W[fj];B[gj]LB[ek:A][al:B]C[rev: again, the strong side does not need any help ... A to run or B to connect]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk];B[fl]LB[al:B][el:A]C[rev: A ...];W[gk];B[dm]

LB[al:A]C[rev: last chance for A];W[ck];B[dj];W[ak]C[I did not win this race.  Could I have?


rev: no, you could not win this "race" but you could run and kill the white group later ...]
;B[ql];W[gp];B[iq]LB[lq:A]C[rev: too close the white stones have access to the border and are much stronge than your single stone ... so keep away ...

A would be better];W[kq];B[io];W[pq];B[nq];W[np];B[oq];W[pp]

;W[po];B[om]LB[nm:A]C[rev: too slow

A would be better];W[on];B[nm];W[nn];B[mo]LB[mn:B][no:A][mp:C]
[qs:D]C[rev: that move is too close and gives white room to run even if white plays at A it can run at B or C later (D is 2nd eye)]
;W[mn];B[lo];W[mp];B[lp];W[mq];B[mr];W[nr];B[ik]LB[jk:A][bq:C]
[gr:B]C[rev: too close -> A

also B or C is interesting];W[gm];B[ep]LB[bq:B][gr:A]C[rev: wrong side, you are pushing white to the border where white is getting stronger

A or B ... better B if you are unsure about the state of you black group]
;W[eq];B[cq]C[rev: attaching a single stone to a opponend group is wrong in most cases. that stone can be used by your oppondend to get stronger. only do it if you know what you are doing]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[aq];W[fp];B[dp];W[bo];B[bp]LB[gr:A]C[rev: not necessary, your black stones are not in danger yet, and there is still enough room for 2 eyes ... so A would be nice instead]
;W[eo];B[do];W[fo];B[gq]C[rev: don't attach];W[fq];B[hq]C[rev: lost sente ...]

;W[pj];B[ok]LB[pm:A]C[rev: an eye here would be an false eye ... and if you are afraid of a connection try A]
