C[Struggle: I have a few questions at certain points, but I'm mainly looking for any advice that would improve my play.  I feel like I lost this game in the opening and middle game so you don't have to worry about reviewing the endgame unless you want to.]

With the marked stone around... this is an open-skirt situation, not really good for white.

For your thickness to work, you should consider pincer at A.]

Not exactly overconcentrated...

White to defend at A to prevent further reduction.];W[bg]LB[eb:A]
[nr:B]C[This move seems like the only game losing mistake I've made since I could have played something like l3 instead


Not really, I feel to defend at A is very important, some bad aji in the corner.

For black to reduce by playing B is an easy option.];B[lq]C[Very risky, I am quite amazed that this works for black.]
;W[or]C[There is some risk that M3 may die... 

Not even 1 eye for now and surrounded by all white stones...]

This could lead to a more severe form of attack.]

;W[kn];B[jm];W[io];B[ln];W[km];B[mo];W[mp];B[lp]C[Black is alive and the game is effectively over here.

I should end my review here.

Some suggestions here for you.

1) On value of move. Decide whether the move you want to play is big or small...

2) On sacrifice. When the stone is not really important (even it is capture it doesn't contribute a lot to your opponent), give it up early.

3) On direction. Compare 2 directions of play and the result, pick one that is more suited for the situation.]
;W[lm];B[mm];W[ml];B[on];W[om]C[I misread this  and lost several stones.  I feel like I'm already behind on territory with a lot of bad aji around the board still.  Which leads me to believe that I played the losing move/s earlier.  This is the end of my comments.]
