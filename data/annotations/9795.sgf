C[WOG: Thanks for supplying this game for review. I like to call this game, "The Loaded Gun at N16"

It seems like the main cause for concern in your game is your aji keshi. There were many times where you erased aji that shouldn't have been, or, where you didn't take advantage of the opponent's aji.

Please understand my comments as humorous, not caustic, mean, or nasty. The humor is meant to instruct.
My comments are prefaced with WOG:. Otherwise, the comments are from someone else.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[Plunder: hi, enjoy the game
death101: hey we will see ^^
death101: good luck
Plunder: :D

WOG: Always good to exchange pleasantries.];B[pq];W[dc];B[fq]
;W[cn];B[ql]C[Not sure what i common here pincer seemed decent.

WOG: I am not familiar with this short low Chinese like opening.]

(;W[ip]C[WOG: Better to kick, then here. See variation.

This way doesn't take advantage of the play at C6.];B[fo]C[WOG: Black gets out scott free here.]

(;W[lp]C[WOG: No base here. Typical is one up one down. These two White stones are floating. 

There are good continuations for Black on both sides of these two floating stones. The move to J2 and the move to M2.

The other thing is that these two stones have no good next. When you're playing your stones, try to have a good next move for them.]

(;B[po]C[WOG: Seems over concentrated for Black with the opening stone there at R8. See variation for a better way that hurts White more.]
;W[nc];B[kd]
(;W[qf]C[WOG: This side isn't interesting due to the stone at R8. If I were Black, I would give it to you. See variation.]

(;B[nd]C[WOG: This way is also possible, but seems ever so slightly lesser than.]

(;W[md];B[mc]C[is there a better way to play this I liked the result I got but I think I could do better?

WOG: This is pretty standard];W[od];B[ne];W[pc];B[oe];W[oc]

(;B[pe]
(;W[mb]C[WOG: This is aji keshi #1. If you go to the corner first, you can atari the other way.]
;B[lc]C[WOG: Black is so happy!];W[lb]C[WOG: UGH! Aji Keshi #2

Forcing Black into a great shape is usually always wrong.];B[kb]
;W[jc]C[WOG: Aji Keshi #3! 

What is the best way forward is to atari the two stones later in the game? You're betting you know the future...]
;B[kc];W[qc];B[rd]
(;W[pj]C[WOG: You seem to not like a base for your stones...]

(;B[ol]C[WOG: I like that it keeps White from playing here and puts pressure on the White stones in the upper right... meh.

There are some other variations to consider.];W[nj]C[WOG: In response, this seems like a good exchange for White. Probably why I don't really enjoy the prior move for Black. Raises the aji of the stone at N16. 

N16 is like seeing a gun on a mantle in the first scene in a movie. The director focused on it just a second too long... Someone's going to get shot with it!]
;B[rc]C[WOG: Aji Keshi for Black];W[rb];B[de]C[WOG: Hard to continue on the right...]
;W[cg];B[ef];W[cd];B[ce];W[fc]C[WOG: OK, I suppose];B[dh]C[WOG: Given the aji at N16, this may be the best. Don't get shot with the gun on the mantle from Scene 1.]
;W[cj];B[ch]
(;W[ej]C[WOG: This move seems a bit unnecessary. Corner is better, I think. See variation]

(;B[dq]C[WOG: Ugh. Black gets to play the corner first this way. I think I like the usual variation for Black better, however.]
;W[cq];B[cr]C[WOG: Seems to be helping White some here.]
(;W[eq];B[dr];W[ep]C[WOG: Ouch];B[er];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[fr]
;W[go];B[hp]
(;W[hq]C[WOG: Why this way?? See variation];B[ho];W[iq];B[cp]
;W[do];B[gn]C[WOG: See the variation at 60 and compare. Black gets practically the same corner but now has also reduced the outside and White group below isn't fully resolved.]
;W[mk]C[WOG: A very subtle move... I don't mind this, although the coordination is better at N8 with the M4 stone, the aji at N16 is in sharp focus now...

It's obvious to the audience that the killer is lurking too close now for comfort... baiting the victim... inch by inch, step by step... the trap is set...]
;B[cl]C[WOG: White had some aji back here that needed addressing however. Nice idea by Black.]

(;W[dk]C[WOG: Does this work???]
(;B[jn]C[WOG: What?! Black needs to go for the kill here.];W[dl]
C[WOG: That was lucky];B[bi];W[bj];B[ln]C[WOG: Black making White stronger with those moves was quite terrible]

(;W[io]C[WOG: this is Aji Keshi #4 isn't it?];B[in];W[ko]C[WOG: more Aji Keshi? #5?!

Don't force Black to connect weak-ish stones!!];B[kn];W[hm]
C[WOG: Seriously! This is aji keshi #6?!];B[hn];W[rf]C[WOG: more Aji Keshi? #7?!]
;B[re];W[rk]C[WOG: While this might seem like a continuous rash of aji keshi, indeed, this move is not.]
;B[rl];W[og]C[WOG: This move is probably just too deliberately pointing at the gun now. You need to be subtle, or just go and get the gun. These sorts of moves are just too obvious.

The problem now is that you've erased so much aji across the landscape, Black has a lot less uncertainty for when you pull the weapon now :(]

(;B[hc]C[WOG: White points at the weapon. Black says, instead of protecting myself against it, I'm going to brace myself instead against this move. 

While not technically bad as there is some aji in White's position in the corner, this isn't addressing the gun at N16.]

(;W[gb]C[WOG: too small. Raise the Aji on the side at N16.

Sometimes you want a base, othertimes you reject it

You have two potential targets and this addresses neither one :(

It does address the miniscule aji of White's in the corner, but now the audience is starting to get weary. Is the villian ever going to pull the gun?!]

(;B[hb]C[WOG: Black likes to keep the suspense going about the gun.]

(;W[be]C[WOG: more Aji Keshi... #8?

See variation];B[bf];W[bd]
(;B[sb]C[WOG: Looks like Black is going to take this small profit before addressing the gun. Well, at least the victim will be safe after this...]
;W[ra];B[lr]C[WOG: Black maybe doesn't see the gun and takes the next best move.]
;W[mr];B[mq];W[lq];B[nr];W[kr];B[ms];W[jq]C[WOG: Black reduces huge in sente.]
;B[bo]C[WOG: Small potato next to the gun on the shelf... N16! N16!]
;W[bn]
(;B[bq]C[WOG: Black just eggs White on...]
(;W[mg]C[WOG: The killer's fans are flabbergasted! After long long last, White can grab the gun, White has been pointing to on the shelf for about an hour, and instead... instead... instead... White mentions to the victim, "Uummm, I'm about to shoot you if you let me grab that gun up there."

In a movie about the gun on the shelf at N16, this move is SOOO disappointing, it's hard to imagine.]
;B[lf]C[WOG: Black wonderfully complies and removes the gun from the killer!!!

While there is still some stuff to wonder about... like B13... it's like watch a straight to video sequel...]
;W[lg];B[rj];W[ri];B[qj];W[qi];B[pk];W[sj];B[qk];W[oj];B[sk]
C[WOG: Utterly endgame and pointless];W[bg]C[WOG: finally!! Maybe the sequel will have some life!]
;B[cf];W[af];B[dg]
(;W[jk]C[WOG: Black still not settled up above... Again, the killer misses the target. Maybe the series should be renamed, the Bumbling Murderer... this part of the game being Part Deux.

White has just reduced the Black position on the left to barely an eye and then wanders off into the center of the board...]
;B[ed]C[WOG: Black, sensing danger, plays on the most urgent part of the board...]
;W[ec];B[fi]C[WOG: With this move, Black has removed a significant amount of aji that was crushing to watch. Albeit, this move is not entirely safe, White's position below, in keeping with White's self-imposed ordinance of - ensure I have no base for my stones, is open to attack.]
;W[ig]C[WOG: A bit too late];B[gc];W[fd];B[fe];W[dd];B[bh];W[ag]
;B[ah];W[ae];B[ee];W[gg]C[WOG: More aji keshi... I've lost count and I don't have the heart to look...]
;B[fg]C[WOG: In Black's own inimitable style </sarcasm>, Black protects against the White onslaught.]
;W[mp]C[WOG: White plays some pointless forcing moves...];B[np]
;W[mn];B[hk]C[WOG: Black continues to apply pressure where pressure is warranted.]
;W[ij]C[WOG: White sensing no danger, in Bumbling Murderer, The Triple Threat, ignores where White is weak and goes for some choice center territory.]

(;B[en]C[WOG: Now White is under attack];W[fj]
(;B[dn]C[WOG: Black goes for the small profit];W[cm]C[WOG: Does this work??]
