;W[cn]C[w C6 is bad. D11 group is strong so w will be under attack. a better move would be F3]
;B[cl];W[en]C[still F3 is better. E6 does nothing];B[fp];W[gn]
;B[hp];W[dk];B[dl];W[ek];B[ck];W[el];B[dj];W[dm];B[qn];W[nq]
;B[lq]C[M3 is strange. if b wants to play in this area, he should have played O3 instead of R6]
;W[qo];B[pn]C[R5 is bad. just play s4];W[be];B[bf];W[bm];B[bp]
C[B7 is an endgame move. the b group is not weak];W[jq]C[why invade now when there remain so many big points ? furthermore, this invasion is a little too strong]
;B[lo];W[kp];B[lp];W[gq];B[gp];W[hr];B[fr];W[jn];B[hn];W[hm]
;B[gm]C[why not j6 then cut ?];W[in];B[ho];W[gl]C[white has gained here]
;B[fq];W[no];B[lm];W[jl];B[nn];W[pj]C[q10 is bad, b group is stronger now, and w plays near the group]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[ip];W[jp];B[oo]C[w not R3 ? the w group is weak and enclosed . it would be difficult to find a good answer to r3]
;W[np];B[lk]C[strabge move. b should pincer the Q10 stone first, at r12 for example]
;W[rp];B[ph];W[rn];B[rm];W[ql]C[terrible move. why peep where you can aim at the cut ?]
;B[sn];W[ro];B[qm];W[nj];B[li];W[qh];B[qg];W[qi];B[pg];W[rl]
;B[rg];W[om];B[on];W[nh];B[nm]C[why play here ? P11 is more interesting]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[mj];B[ol]C[again, what is this move ? the P7 stone is of no interest, but the M10 gap is very important]
;W[nc]C[M10 is the only move];B[nd];W[pb];B[mc];W[oc];B[od]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rc];B[ic];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[lj];B[kk]
;W[kj];B[jk];W[ki];B[kq]C[??? end of the record

white seems to have a bad judgemnt about strength and weaknesses of groups, so he attacks in bad situations

black on the contrary does not handle fights correctly. Try to find what are the important stones (cutting stones) and counter attack when you have strong groups]
