Before looking at the game progression, there are 2 things we can see from the end position that are a direct explanation for why you lost by 10.5 points.

At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has used his stones more efficiently.]

I think white gains much more than me...


=====

I don't know how you can say that.

When I look at the board, Black is ahead by much.

I think you forget that you have 3 handicap stones. This is bad: in a handicap game, you should be maximising the efficiency of your stones on the whole board, not be trying to gain more than your opponent in 1 corner of the board.]

I don't see a reduction. I see a weak black group floating in the center.

White can attack this group to gain enough profit to win the game.]
;B[jl];W[il];B[kj];W[nc]C[maybe somthing like M17 or L17 is better...

===

When you played Q17, did you ask yourself if these moves were better, or is it only because you asked that this game be reviewed that you forced yourself to ask this question?

The questions you ask yourself during the game will make you improve much faster than the questions you ask after the game.

I can show you things that you might not think about, so that you can think about them in your later games.]

1-2-3-4-5 is a horrible exchange. Did you get compensated for sacrificing R8?

Remember that you played R11 in order to save R8 at the beginning of the game. Because of R11 you got sealed in.

So R11 which was supposed to save R8 in exchange of being sealed in, turns out to not save R8! You can't expect to win if you play like that.

Does it start to make sense when I say you have to remember why you play your moves in order to maximise the efficiency of your stones?]

(;B[fn]TR[el]C[====

This is the end game phase. Not the time to play moves like F6.

F6 only helps white build the territory that is already his.

You may say that you gained a few points, but when you count the ammount of stones you need to play to gain the territroy around E8, you will see that it is not efficient.

I gave you examples of nice end game sequences.

The review stops here. White's end game really sealed the deal. I think you could have won from this position.]

(;B[jj])
(;B[ji]C[===

I'll let you decide which move is the best (playing go is about deciding which move is the best).

If you just play the first move that comes to mind, you're not really playing go.

Before each move, if you are able to find 2 moves and take the time to decide which of those 2 moves is the better one, you will play at a whole different level.

Alot of players ask: "what is the best move"

This is not a good way of thinking: I am convinced that even the pros can't answer that question unless it is a very specific situation that has been thoroughly analyzed.

Instead of asking that question, develop a system of thought in which you can analyze and choose moves that you think are good.

In this case, becoming a better player means improving your system of thought (and not developping some crazy intuition as to which is the best move)]

;B[pi];W[ng]TR[kj][kl][ql][kn]SQ[pg]C[===

The fact that you have a weak group in the center prevents you from getting profit by attacking white.

But at least, you didn't give the R8 stone to white. This might have been enough for you to win the game.]

;W[on];B[np];W[rp];B[qq]

The joseki ends like this.

This is precisely the stone you need in order to make your large keima efficient!!!

And it works well with the stones you just played (by preventing the inefficient shape we see at the end).

R11 is exactly the kind of move I'm talking about when I say that you play moves that seem logical, but the logic disappears later on (especially since, later, you sacrificed R8!!!).]

What you get out of the invasion is a wall.

You can say, that this wall helps you. But White is not a fool. He will not immediately invade you.

He will start by playing moves that will make this wall inefficient, and then he will invade you in sente.]

[jn][kn][ln][ko]C[Final Shape 2:

Even worse. Only 1 point. (of course the group is connected to another formation).

The point is, all these stones accomplish nothing.

They do not kill.
They do not meaningfully seperate your opponent.
They don't give you significant territory.
etc.

At 6k, you're at a point where this type of consideration is the difference between losing and winning a game.

So when you play your moves, you must ask yourself: "at the end of the game, are these stones gonna be worth it?"

Right now, your moves may seem logical to you when you play them, but they lose that logic as the game progresses. 
The main challenge you face in order to progress, is to be able to give meaning to the stones you play, in order to prevent situations like this (or to cause them to your opponent).]
