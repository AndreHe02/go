AB[pd][dp]C[Hello.  Thanks in advance for the review!

R: Hi! I assume I should review white. Remarks marked with "R:"]

;W[fn];B[nf];W[el]C[Probably should have just responded at Q12.  I take territory and O14 is overconcentrated.

R: Agree, black can severely attack the upper side and his previously overconcentrated stones become good stronghold for killing/surrounding. However its a handicap game :)]
;B[ph];W[cl]C[R: I think this exchange good for black. bottom left corner hardly can be killed by one move, but upper right seems to be territory if black make one more move.]
;B[dr];W[bm];B[eq];W[fp];B[bn];W[qi];B[pf]C[R: Black is very co...err.. cautious :)]
;W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[pg];W[re]TR[nj]C[R: second line seems to be small in this stage.
Extending the moyo or invasion would be more important.];B[qe]
;W[rf];B[rd];W[fj];B[eh];W[qp]C[I chose this side because the bottom left is reduceable at F2.]
;B[or]C[This looks awkward and low, but I think I let him get too much here.  Variations for responding to this would be appreciated.

R: Black primary goal here would be to create "sabaki" (group of losely connected stones what can live or escape). I feel so that this stone can be completely destroyed with the outer strength, but it is extremely difficult. 
White is ok, so  best option is to press that low position to more and more lower:)]

(;W[np]C[Too loose I think.
R: I agree];B[mq];W[mp];B[lq];W[lp];B[qr];W[kq]

(;W[cc]C[Is there a better invasion here?  This really solidifies black's moyo at the top.  Not so good.

R: san-san is easy and safe solution. An invasion at F16 or even F17 is still possible however.]

;B[ec];W[gh];B[fi];W[gi];B[gj]C[I'd also appreciate advice around this sequence here.  I thought I could kill black here...

R: I think it would be very hard if not imposibble to kill black without secrifice. Nevertheless i would play H10 here to kill...]

(;W[fk];B[hj]
(;W[jj]C[R: If you want to kill, you *must* prtect your cutting stones. see var.]
;B[ii];W[ji]C[Decided to sacrifice G11 because I've realized I can't kill black like this.

R: good thought, but you should have started before :)];B[ih]
;W[jh];B[ig];W[ik];B[jg];W[kg];B[kf];W[lg];B[lf];W[qc]C[This looks a little unreasonable, but I'm giving stones so I thought I'd give it a shot.

;B[oa];W[pa];B[ni];W[nk]C[I was seeking to avoid complications that might appear if I attached at O10, but this feels submissive to me in retrospect.

R: A dont think attach at O10 is good. Black will break througt.]

R:  very strange move from black. gote -1 pont at least. F2 might turn the match]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[fr];B[cm];W[bk];B[em];W[fm];B[eo]
(;W[hk]C[Wrong side.  Still have a weakness at G8.  Maybe?

R: Maybe :) If there is a weakness I cant see. However after F5 and E6 white should deffend. yep. 

anyway, some sente moves at L3, Q3, T2 seems to be better.]
