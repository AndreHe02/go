C[okay, well there's not much for me to say really.  i don't know why you want me to review a sudden death game - there are a lot of really bad moves and i'm sure a lot o fit had to do with the time pressure!]

C[everything up to here is okay, but you should realize that your group is not very stable, whereas he has created two groups that are at least anchored to the sides.]
;B[od];W[pf]C[now note that his move indirectly attacks your bottom group by making his right side group stronger.]
;B[of]C[here you are pushing him towards your nottom group]
;W[pg];B[og];W[pi]C[you keep pushing.  now he is totally settled on the right side and you have two very weak groups.]
;B[oi]C[not sure what you are trying to do here.  connect your groups?  he won't let that happen I'm sure...]
