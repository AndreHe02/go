 Hello. I have several questions about the opening and early
 middlegame.
 Also about choosing the best move during middle game.
I realize I messed up several tsumegos but I have already reviewed them.

Nicholas Roussos (NR): 
Hello Terrence. My comments in this review will be preceeded by my initials, NR. I hope the review helps you. Feel free to contact me at nroussos@gmail.com with your feedback for my review. I would like to hear from you.

General comments:
1) An overall easy win for white. By following some of my comments, I think you can improve a little and take advantage of some opportunities when these appear.

2) Pay attention to direction of play, and try to attack opponent groups efficiently, without forcing them to attack your own weak groups.

3) When you manage to cut off groups, capture them if you can. It's worth the points usually.

4) study and understand the simple josekis that you missed in this game, especially the one in the bottom right corner.

NR: K4 or K3 seems more in line with your position. That is, extend from D4 and at the same time play in the area you want to play. R10 is not an extension.

Also, my sensei says: "he who invades first, loses the game".]

NR: Well, the proverb says: "If one jump two, if two jump three". If you had a stone at Q10, R6 would be great. Now it is "attackable", as black can play R8, as he did.
