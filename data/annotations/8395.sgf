C[>Hello and thank you for reviewing the game. (I am black)

I'm not sure where I went wrong other than a bad 3-3 in this game. Any help would be appreciated. I keep losing against this friend of mine and would love to be a better opponent. We are both 9k, but I feel like he is 1 or 2 stones stronger than me.

>> Hello my nickname is ouafouaf, or jocorbeau on KGS. I will try to help you with some comments ;)
When entering the middle game (let say around move 34), the game seems about even to me. 
Giving up in the corner was a turning point, and there wasn't much to do after that.]

C[>> It might not be important, but this stone would be better on the 4th line. Since you have two stones on the 3rd line on the right, placing your extension higher on the left is more harmonious. Also, it would be more active against the white stone at C6.]
;W[ck];B[qh]C[> Is this good? I know it is fuseki in some games, but is it good here?

>> It is good, yes. It's an obvious big move, and you're in good position now. White answer is a bit too aggressive, I think.]

>> Many weakness for white, nothing to be afraid of so far. Also, white shape offers some nice cut points, but maybe it's to early to attack (see var.2) But anyway, this move is not bad for black's influence. 

>> variation 1: What about extending your top corner ? If white plays where you played (N5), it doesn't help white a lot, but certainly help black who is happy to extend his territory at the bottom

>> variation 2: A more aggressive solution. Maybe too early (would be better with some support at the top), but it shows that while isn't very solid.]
