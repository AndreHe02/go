C[XCMeijin: Dear reviewer, thank you for analysing my game!

Although i won by 16.5 points, i still feel there are some points worth analysing over. Please help!

R: I've made some comments and some variations. Hope it helps. Cheers -- unstable.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[po];B[qo];W[pp]C[XCMeijin: This particular joseki I am not familiar with. Although the end result seems OK for me, can you point out some better, less risky paths?]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pn]C[R: Another popular variation is R6. Both are complicated. Check out "kogo joseki dictionary" for some variations.]
;W[qq];B[pr]
(;W[qr]C[R: R2 is a mistake. The normal move for white is S3 here, see var.]

(;B[op]C[R: See variation... w took advantage here. The proper punishment is p2]

(;W[ro];B[no];W[on];B[nn];W[pm];B[op];W[nm];B[fq]C[XCMeijin: I think this looks good for me.

R: compared to the standard variation, w took abit of advantage.]
;W[hq]C[R: this looks like an overplay.];B[fo];W[cn]
(;B[ho];W[kq];B[ko]C[XCMeijin: Maybe this is a bit too obvious, greedy? It's hard for white to live, but also not that easy to kill.  Any thoughts?

R: L5 seems fine here.];W[gp];B[fp];W[go];B[gn];W[hn];B[io]

C[XCMeijin: Empty triangle, but i don't think i had a choice]
;W[er];B[gr];W[dk]C[XCMeijin: After this move, when I look at the whole board, my first thought is that white seems to have the lead

R: b is quite good actually. The reason is that H3 died. Also, D9 should be at around R11.]
;B[cf]C[XCMeijin: Would you recommend playing here? Where is the better point?

R: Somewhere around R11 is probably bigger, since both black and white want that point.]

(;W[ch]C[XCMeijin: I think i was a bit surprised with this move, although not in a bad way. White has made himself overconcentrated a bit, and the D16 stone is still open. What do you think?

R: No, C12 is appropriate here.  It would be different if D9 were at C10. But here it's almost expected. F17 would be rather comfortable for black]
;B[fc]C[XCMeijin: Classic approach... would you recomment another move?

R: This should work out fine... C17 is another possibility.]
;W[ee];B[jd];W[cc];B[eh]C[XCMeijin: I'm particularly proud of what happened from this move onward. Am I right to be?]
;W[dg];B[ci]C[XCMeijin: This move looked interesting to me, so i played it. Thoughts?

R: seems appropriate. white has to be careful.]
(;W[di]C[R: Seems like overplay.];B[dh];W[cj];B[bi];W[cg];B[df]

;W[pj]C[R:];B[pk];W[oj];B[nj];W[ni];B[ok];W[oi];B[mj]LB[qk:A]
C[XCMeijin: Perhaps i played N10 out of greed. I probably should've played at A to reduce complications. Thoughts?

R: yes, n10 is unreasonable.];W[qk];B[ql];W[rk];B[rl]C[XCMeijin: I had read up to here...]
;W[sj]C[XCMeijin:... But not here T.T];B[ri];W[sf]C[R: t14 is a mistake. t13 kills cleanly.]
;B[sl]C[XCMeijin: I don't think playing to start another ko at T9 would've worked anyway...]
;W[sh];B[sg];W[ip];B[jp];W[sh];B[ei]C[XCMeijin: I would've thought this was a big enough threat...]
;W[rj];B[dj];W[ck];B[ek];W[pl];B[mi]C[R: wrong direction. The stones at N10 are not useful. How about something like K12 instead?]
;W[nk];B[mh]C[XCMeijin: I feel i have the upper hand at this point in the game.

R: n9 is a mistake for white. o13 would have been better.];W[lc]
C[XCMeijin: This move proved to be a whole world of pain for me. How best to deal with this?

R: not clear. Seems about even. Depends on the endgame i think. See a variation

It was a very pleasant game, i was very happy with the invasion i made in the upper right. Obviously i'll have to work on my life and death; how i ever let white live in the upper right...

Any extra comments will be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!
