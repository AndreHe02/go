C[Dear reviewer,

my name is Martin and I was white in this game. My opponent was Eric Lui from America, I think he is 6 or 7 dan but am not sure. My rank is 4d EGF.

I would like to ask you to show me some strategies for the lower right corner, I think I didn't do well there in the fuseki and fell under the pressure.

I'll also ask a few questions during the game, my comments will begin with FM as my nick is Field Mouse.

Thanks a lot for the review!

Hi Martin!

My name is Jon and I'll be providing the commentary for your review.  My comments are marked with "Jon:".

To clarify on Eric Lui's rating, he's 8-9d KGS.];B[cp];W[pq]

(;B[fc]TR[cf][cj]C[Jon:  Moving out the corner stone is pretty passive in this position, it allows white's marked stones to make an overly comfortable base on the left side.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[dh]C[Jon:  White gets too large a base and a nice cache of points, so you can be happy with this result.]
;B[qo]
(;W[qm]LB[mq:A]C[Jon:  Alternatives for this move are discussed in the variations.]
;B[mq]LB[po:B][op:A][qp:C]C[FM: This was the hardest moment of the game for me. I can think of the A,B and C possibilities, but I don't see any really good continuations here. Maybye it's just because of the r7 pincer?

Jon:  From what I can tell, it's the pincer, since black can double approach any of them, so I would consider moving out the corner stone instead of the pincer.  At this point though, my preference would be the kosumi at A.]

(;W[po]LB[op:A][pp:B]C[Jon:  The kosumi at A looks slightly better to me since black can poke around with the wedge at B next and try to force you out of the corner.]
;B[pp]
(;W[op]C[Jon:  Because white's resulting wall will be rendered useless, I'd consider making the atari from the other side.]
;B[qp];W[pn];B[qq];W[oq];B[no];W[oo];B[jp]C[FM: this result feels really painful even with the r2 ko possibility

Jon:  Agreed, this is why I would prefer to avoid building the outside wall and try to take the corner instead.]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[pj];B[qd];W[qf];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb];B[pb]
;W[qe];B[pd];W[oe];B[el];W[fq]TR[cl][el]C[FM: another difficult move to make. I wanted to live there but was afraid of getting killed so I chose to run away

Jon:  It's tough to live in there with the marked stones so close, so I'd prefer to use this move and run away too.]

(;W[ml]LB[jk:A]C[Jon:  I'd be inclined to omit this exchange, it strengthens black and pushes him towards your escaping stones, so to avoid this, I'd prefer to jump out directly to A.]
;B[lm];W[jk];B[gp];W[hp];B[nl];W[nk];B[ll];W[mk];B[il];W[jl]
;B[lk]LB[ml:1][lm:2]C[Jon:  Now it's become clear that the 1-2 exchange hurt white.]
;W[ol];B[li];W[ji];B[bc]LB[ic:A]C[Jon:  This is pretty slow, I'd like to exand at A instead.]
;W[qr]LB[jc:A]C[FM: the upper side is probably too big to start this ko - anything played there will add white ko threats.

Jon:  Not totally sure what you mean, do you mean that white should extend there first?  I would be interested in making an extension to around A first.]

;B[qs];W[ln];B[mn];W[qr];B[rm];W[qn];B[qs];W[kp];B[lp];W[qr]
;B[pe];W[or]C[FM: q14 was too big as it is sente for black and gives him the super attacking extension on the upper side. I played this move because I misread badly - I thought I can kill the big black group if I surround it from the centre.

Jon:  Agreed, black's bottom stones won't have much trouble living, so responding to the ko threat would be best.]

;B[mg];W[mi];B[ng];W[lr];B[mr];W[ms];B[ns];W[ls];B[nr];W[js]
;B[lq];W[is];B[np]C[FM: the game is over now. It's quite shame to misread like this but I liked this game anyway. The game had 199 moves and in the end I resigned, but nothing really interesting happened after this as black has a safe win now.

Jon:  No worries, mistakes happen.  

Thank you very much for allowing me to comment your game! I hope you found it helpful, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.]

(;W[qp]C[Jon:  This will allow white to make some points and a base.]
;B[op];W[qq];B[pn];W[ro];B[oo]))
(;W[op]C[Jon:  The kosumi makes the corner easier to grab, but it also pokes out into the center.]
;B[jp];W[qp]LB[op:A]C[Jon:  This result looks a bit more playable.]
))
(;W[np]C[Jon:  White can consider moving out the corner stone along the bottom, but the question is finding which specific move would be best.  My first thought was this keima, but...]
;B[lq]C[Jon:  The double approach is quite annoying to white.]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[pl];B[pn];W[qp];B[rp];W[rq];B[pp];W[qq];B[ql]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[pk];B[rm]LB[jq:A][oq:B]TR[lq]C[Jon:  This would make the pincer at white A more feasible, though I'm concerned at black's marked stone peeking in at B, so I'm not totally thrilled with this.]
)
(;W[op]C[Jon:  Next idea was the kosumi, but black can double approach this too.]
;B[kq]C[Jon:  This double approach is still annoying to white, so I didn't like this much either.]
)
(;W[mq]C[Jon:  Since the first two don't work totally, how about the two point extension?  While it's passive, it's the most effective at countering black's enclosure on the bottom left.  I can't think of much else for preventing black's  extension along the bottom.]
;B[qk]))
(;B[ch]C[Jon:  I much prefer to pincer and create some interference.]
;W[ef];B[fd];W[di];B[bd];W[dh]C[Jon:  This is the simplest development for this position.]
