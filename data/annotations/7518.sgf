C[REVIEWER: Pete Martin, 4k AGA
General comment for white: in this game white has created too many weak groups which black was able too separate and secure territory while attacking. This is the main reason black was able to win. Black stones were never really under severe attack by white in this game. This is because black attacked first and had time to get strong. So I think white needs to be more aware of this: create fewer weak groups.
White should also look for moves that are more efficient and accomplish the same main objective.]
;B[pq]C[Pete: small advice: black should make habbit of always starting in top-right corner.]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[qd];B[jc];W[po];B[qm]LB[pc:A][pe:B][qe:C][qm:D]
TR[qd]C[Pete: The pincer move at D might be questioned by dan-level players. Black has to inspect the whole right-side to see what will happen next after the lower right corner is stable. Move at D would be excellent if the marked white stone was sitting at A. This would give black great aproach-move at B or C. As or right now, the right side is the strong-side of the marked white stone and top side is its weak side.]
;W[op]LB[qd:E][pm:A][on:D][ro:C][jq:F][qq:B]C[Pete: this is not a joseki. Typical josekis response for white ranges from A to D. I would have probably elected to play at A, strenthen white formation and push the black stone towards the strong side of the white stone at E. As soon as possible white would then play around F to prevent black from making lots of territory at the bottom.]
;B[oq];W[ep]LB[ep:A]C[Pete: white left the bottom right corner very much unfinished. If black wanted, he could easily ignore the move at A and attack the two stones first (and still end up with sente to respond to A). Because of the weakness of the two stones, black will by the end of the game end up making a lot of points in the lower right part of the board. So this is answer part 1 to your question as to where and why white has given up a lot of territory.]

(;B[dn]
(;W[dq]LB[cq:A]C[Pete: not a joseki. Normal (and only joseki) response is to attach at A. See variation.]

(;B[cq];W[hq]LB[iq:A]C[Pete: in joseki, the white stone would land one point further (at A).]

(;B[lq];W[qk]LB[om:A]C[Pete: this move seems to agressive because the two stones are not safe yet. If now black responds at A, the two stones are in trouble. Luckly for white, black did not think about separating the 3 stontes into two groups.]
;B[qo]C[Pete: too submissive move - gives white sente and allows white to connect this stones.]
;W[qh]LB[qk:A]TR[po][op]C[Pete: saving the two marked stones is more important right now then worrying about A.]

(;B[pp];W[oo]
(;B[oc]LB[om:A]C[Pete: again, move at A is a huge move for black now. White will have to respond and try to run. See variation.]

(;W[mc]LB[qf:A]C[Pete: white is creating another weak group. Notice that the second place on the board where black ended up with a ton of territory was in the upper right. Black took adventage of white spreading too thin. 
See variations.]
(;B[qc];W[od]C[Pete: good response by white .. allows white to create a wall facing down.]
;B[pd];W[pe];B[pc]
(;W[qf];B[rd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf]LB[mc:B][oe:A]C[Pete: in the variation that I presented few moves ago, white ends up in similar position but has a stone at A which allows it to connect with the stone at B.]
;B[nd];W[oe];B[nc];W[gc]LB[mc:A]C[Pete: good move. White can later on try to resque the stone at A.]
;B[ld]LB[cj:A]C[Pete: OK, black really likes that stone, doesn't he? White should smile and play at A next.]
;W[id]LB[gc:A][id:B]C[Pete: the kights-move shape that is formed by the stones at A and B is not very strong here. It can be cut. Black will take adventage of this to gain sente ...]
;B[ic];W[hc];B[ce]LB[mc:A][cf:B]C[Pete: .. there - black comfortably swallowed the stone at A and got himself sente. It would have been better for black to approach at B though. The white stones up top are very strong now and white will do what it should in this situation - push the black stone towards the white wall.]
;W[cg]C[Pete: good move.];B[cd];W[cc];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fe]
;B[bc];W[cb];B[bb]
(;W[ca]LB[cg:A]C[Pete: this move is a bit slow, I think (doesn't kill black and doesn't make white alive and doesn't gain much points). More important to make the stone at A stronger ASAP. See variations.]
;B[dg];W[dh];B[eg];W[ck]LB[ci:A]C[Pete: yes, correct way to try to establish a base .. although it is a bit lose .. imagine what would happen if black played at A now.]
;B[cm]LB[ci:A]C[Pete: black can be more agressive then this (as I mentioned, playing at A is a very good strong move).]
;W[el]LB[ci:B][dj:C][ek:A][pl:E][om:D]C[Pete: would be safer for white to play at A. Black could play at B or C next .. so keeping white stones closer together is important. Move by black at D or E would be extremly powerful right now. It would basically erase whites hopeful moyo and influence. Luckily white sees this and fixes the situation :)]
;B[bg]C[Pete: unfortunately for black, this move helps white secure the base and gives white the sente.]
;W[bh];B[cf];W[ch];B[af]C[Pete: white got sente];W[ol]C[Pete: oh yes, we forgot about this group]

(;B[ni]LB[oi:A]C[Pete: Black could go as deep as A here. But it is more important to attack the weak formation at the bottom right at this moment.]
;W[oh]LB[md:D][me:C][lf:E][kp:B][mp:A]SQ[ni]C[Pete: this move by white is too slow. It doesn't really secure many points. Moves at A or B have more potential in creating influence. If white really wanted to attack the marked stone, white should probaly play at C first, allow black to connect at D and then play at E (surround the marked black stone).]
;B[nh]
(;W[oi]C[Pete: this move is territory-oriented .. but white could be a more agressive and try to isolate the black stones more. Territorry will form itself in this process .. watch ..]
;B[ng];W[og]LB[fn:C][kp:B][jq:A]C[Pete: this move by white also does not accomplish much (worth 1 point in gote). White should consider moves like A-C now.]

;B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[ji]LB[jq:A]C[Pete: black can get more territory by playing at A. If black wants to make territory in the center, he should attack white first and only through the attacks gain strength to build territorry. See variation.]
