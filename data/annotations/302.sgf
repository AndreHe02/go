HA[0]KM[0.5]RE[B+34];B[pd]C[Here is a game where I played a superior opponent, me 18k him 16k,
where I developed a good lead i think
only to fall behind later on.];W[pp];B[dc];W[dp];B[ce];W[pj];B[jq];W[mq]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[fo]C[KT: I think this is too early.];W[dr];B[lp]C[Here I thought he  was threatening n4 but in hindsight it looks like good preparation for r3 or  p3 or q6.]
;W[cj];B[ch]C[KT: Not much potential.];W[no];B[mp];W[np];B[lm];W[nc]C[KT: The question is, on which side to kakari.  My inclination would  be to play there too, I would fear black territory on top.

However, I think the other side, around r14 it better. ;-)   You have much more potential for territory.  Now it is hard to make any.]
;B[oc]C[This looks like a mistake by him.

KT: Yes, that move strenghtens W.];W[nd];B[oe]C[KT: Is not a threat, and does  not really protect the corner.

B should play either on top, or around r13.  Now it is too easy for W.]
;W[jd];B[ph];W[gc]C[I can't really tell if this is bigger than playing around q7.

KT: A problem with this move is that it is gote.  I dont think you can ignore  the threat to Q10,

q7 is too low. O7?];B[pm];W[nm];B[nl];W[ol];B[om];W[ml];B[nk];W[mm]C[KT: You  have made it very easy for B.  Separating M7 from R7 doe not bring you much,  both are very strong, and you have lost half the right side. In gote!

Move 30 at p7, and attack q7.];B[pk];W[ql];B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[qo]C[This was  also to defend the corner.]
;B[oj];W[kn]C[A forcing move to create potential.

KT: This strenghts B.  There are big moves on the top side.];B[ln];W[kl]
;B[ko]C[KT: What have you gained?];W[fm];B[mn];W[nn];B[ll];W[mk];B[mj];W
[lk];B[kk];W[mf];B[nf];W[ne];B[of];W[mg]C[KT: Gote.  Around f15 is bigger, I  think. You can still reduce B with m10.]
;B[jl];W[hm];B[im];W[gp];B[fp];W[go];B[gq];W[fn];B[hn];W[gn];B[hl];W[gk]
C[KT: Big moves on top!];B[hk];W[gj];B[gl]C[Here I thought w g9 was full of cleverness but the cut at f9 favored  black.]
;W[ek];B[fl];W[el];B[fk];W[fj];B[di];W[ej];B[dj];W[ck];B[nb]C[Sigh, I  had been hoping to play w r17 but I have waited to long.]
;W[mb];B[ob];W[lc]C[KT: maybe not necessary.  You can strenghten left border  by moves that gain territory, f17 or something.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[ga]C[Seems he  is doing this to early. I is only making me solid and hard to attack.

KT: You are already very hard to attack.];W[ha];B[fa];W[ib];B[kj];W[in]
C[Here my eventual goal was to try to kill the  f4 group. It didn't work out though.]
;B[gm];W[ho];B[jn];W[jo]C[KT: ?];B[io];W[ip];B[jp]C[After this i gave up.]
;W[cp]C[KT: Gote! I do not think this is  necessary.

If you are very ill at easy with 4-4, maybe open at 3-4 for a while.

If you want to strenghten this corner, attack along the lower side.  B is  nervous about the f4 group, and will respond.   Big moves on top too!]
;B[er];W[fc];B[eb];W[ec];B[db];W[ff]C[In hindsight this  should have been at around w k12.

KT: Actually, I think this is ok.];B[jg];W[li];B[lj];W[dd];B[cd];W[de];B
[df];W[ef];B[dg];W[eh]C[KT: This was gote.  B did not need to respond.

 I think! :-)];B[ci];W[jh]C[KT: If you want to cut him off, you must play at  a distance, eg k11.

But even if you succeed, B will make a dent in you territory elsewhere.

But you cannot do it by playing contact here.  You strenghten k13. Play  contact where you are weak, at a distance where you are strong.   I would defend.

(But maybe I am a coward!)];B[kh];W[ki];B[ji];W[ih];B[lh];W[mi]C[KT:  Where  are you going to?]
;B[mh];W[ni];B[nh];W[nj]C[KT: You put yourself in atari!   ???];B[ok]C[KT: Pardon?]
;W[jj];B[jk];W[ij]C[A BIG mestake by me.

KT: The mistakes were made before.];B[oi];W[if];B[ig];W[hg];B[jf];W[je]

;B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[rk]C[KT: NO! This is gote.  There are sente moves.  Best are "double  sente", ie sente for you and your opponent.

EG M2, threatens an ape.];B[rj];W[rl];B[lq];W[mr];B[lr];W[sj];B[ri];W[hq]
C[KT: NO! Gote, and very small.];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir];W[hp];B[ds];W[cr];B[ak]

C[KT: Since  your h2, B has sente, and he collected quite some points.]
;W[pn];B[sk];W[sl]C[KT: Not now, t8 is gote for B.];B[on];W[oo];B[lg]C[KT: ?]
;W[ep];B[ng];W[gr]C[I knew this didn't work but you never know when he will make a mestake.

KT: Ok. In a desperate situation, desperate moves are ok.];B[gs];W[od]C
[Now i  am a little desperate for points.

This aims at r17.];B[me];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qb];W[qf];B[pe]
;W[qg]C[KT: I dont think it is possible, but 2-2 is the vital point.];B
