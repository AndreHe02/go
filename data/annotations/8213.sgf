I am not sure whether the weak spots are weak enough. The black stone in atari and the three stones with only two liberties work a bit too well for white. I am a fairly aggressive player who would try to invade or attack if at all possible, so I know what i'm talking about :-)]

OK, I think the most important things were:
* not attacking the weak white group enough
* you should make solid shape when attacking
* if you want to attack a stone, don't attach to it. In general, the opponent will extend and make his stone a lot stronger

I hope this review was helpful, and good luck with your future games !]
