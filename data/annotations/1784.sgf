Hi reviewer !
I played this game on KGS, whith slow control time.
I dismissed in the end of chuban, but I guess I lost that game
much sooner,
and I'd like to understand what happened.

I'm used to review my own games:=20
so you'll find many commentaries of my own all along.
Thanks!];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]
(;W[qj]LB[cj:E][dj:C][pn:F][qn:D][po:B][qo:A]C[Well, my first comment is here.  Move 6 doesn't seem to be part
of the Professional approach, so to speak.  When doing a search
for this position on Gobase, up to move 5 is normal (91 games
from the position) move 6 is new.  Well, my opinion of why are in the two variations.  Both seem ok for black to me.

Note that A through to F are the normal white moves in this position.]

(;B[dn]C[my favorite opening.
I don't know if it is very acadmeic, but I like it.];W[qo]
(;B[po]C[Lauching that joseki is perhaps a mistake ...
Is lower middle hoshi better ?];W[pn];B[oo];W[qp];B[qq];W[qm]

(;B[nq]C[trop pres ? ??
could I play further on the edge ?

YES!

See variation.];W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dl]C[Solid connection is more normal.  This leaves some bad aji.]
;W[fp];B[cg]C[to far stone ?
perhaps:
I have one weak group attackable now.
If I want to play far, worth approching keima of lower left hoshi.

=18Yet, the balance of territory isn't good for me ...

Personally, I would extend one closer to your group.  You are right you do have a soft spot on the right side, but its not critical yet.]
;W[gc]LB[jq:A]TR[nq]C[How did I reach such situation ?
How could it be avoided ? (I mean bad balance )
Look,
  white lower left is huge in comparison with black's upper right
  black's lower right is not as big as neighbour white
  white upper left is more stable than weak black's middle left.

Do you agree with such vision ?
Why is it so ?

The bad balance you precive comes from two things, the fact you didn't extend farther from your group in the bottom right and your slight over extension on the left.   Look at this same position with the mark stone at A instead.  In that position the white group on the left is slightly high and a bit weaker the black group on the botom right.

All things considered though, your position isn't bad.  Your group on the left isn't that weak, and you can try to correct your mistake on the bottom right.]
;B[jd]LB[eg:A][iq:C][jq:B]C[no:
the last white move attacks upper left black stone:
worth playing 'a' ?

A is large, but I think B or C is larger still.];W[iq]C[Big points move.
But was it the best one ?

I think so...see last comment.  :)];B[ph];W[oj];B[he]
(;W[ld]C[Overplay perhaps?  Since white has gotten in J3, I think hes perhaps a bit ahead.  I would play the following as white:]
;B[ni]C[I'm not so sad about those las ones.
(of course, white _had_ to invade I guess.];W[oe];B[pe]C[Hum ...
was there such danger so I had to defend like that ?
In fact I thought:
"build territory while attacking"
was it good ?

Thats exactly what you should do.];W[lf];B[fe]C[Same Idea:=20
acquiring power.
Am I mistaking ?

Again, more or less what I would do.];W[fd];B[io]LB[jh:A]C[what about that one ?
I just tried a capping move, guessing it was a good direction
at that time.
But I don't know what kind of strategy to build with that ...

Here I might try a move around A to limit the scope of that group.]
;W[lq]
(;B[lp]LB[fn:A]C[no:
at least one line upper ...
but I would have prefered something like A,=20
going on getting middle board influence.

A is very big.];W[kp];B[ko];W[jp];B[jo];W[gn]LB[kf:A][jg:B]
C[yes, I would have prefered to let white escape the other way:
on the right side, connecting whith his other group:
this could have let me build my so beloved middle board moyo
...]
(;B[kf]C[clearly a bad black move:
one never attaches his stone while attacking !
what would have been better ?];W[lg];B[kg];W[lh];B[kh];W[li]

(;B[nj]C[this could have been a nice move another time ..
but what about now ?

I think its totally needed.  If you let the whtie group escape without a fight, then you lose the abilty to create your moyo with the attack.]
;W[ki]LB[jj:A]C[this shows what should have been previous black move:
'a'];B[hm]LB[gl:A]C[what am I intending to do ?
directing white into my poor moyo?
(in fact I'm looking for isolating upper white group)
Wouldn't 'a' be better ?

Finally, my lower wall doesn't server anything, does it ?];W[em]
;B[el]C[(thanks white ! ;)];W[dm];B[fm];W[en];B[cc]LB[ii:B]
[lk:A]C[A "big points" move,
but was it time ?

Is there another better place to play ?
Strengthen lower left position ?=20
(where white should have invade I guess )
Elsewhere ?

Perhaps around 'a' where building moyo while threatening white's
group?

Or definitely closing this other moyO at 'b' ?

This is ok, but I would play at K11 asap personally, not so much as to kill white but to secure the moyo.  Your move is more or less sente as well, as if you get C16 in your territory on the side is very large.]

(;B[fb]C[What about the sequence ?
Was there a better thing to play ?

Perhaps tenuki.]

(;B[om]LB[lk:A][pk:B]C[I'm still doubtfull about that one ...
did I intend to capture white upper group ... hem, seems very
greedy.
How could I exploit the weakness of that group for my benefit
?

Is a move like 'a' good at that time ?

There is still an attacking move at 'b',=20
but how and why to play it ?

Ok first of all, A is not the right way in my opinion.  My reasoning is that you don't want to run a group INTO your territory.  If it lives, you lose everything.  B is aji, and kind of small so leave it for now.  The move is, you guessed it, K11.]

;W[jl];B[lj];W[kk];B[mj];W[jj]C[
Thanks reviewer !

The positions is still very close, so I would have played on some more.  Even with a 5.5 komi I think if you play the end game well you could still win this.  Let me indulge and try to play it out.  Rember, that this is by no means best play for ethier side.

The remainder of the game is by me.];B[gk]C[First of all you need to protect your nest egg.]
