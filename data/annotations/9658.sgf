C[Hi, I'm Norman the reviewer. I haven't played much go lately, but I'll try to give you some helpful comments. You're welcome to email me at Norman314@gmail.com with any further questions. My username on KGS is Norman314.

First off, why are you playing an even game with a much stronger player? You'll learn more if you play with an appropriate handicap. One handicap stone on a 13 by 13 board is worth a little bit more than two stones on a 19 by 19 board, so a five or six stone handicap would be appropriate.]
;B[jc];W[dk];B[ke];W[cd];B[kk];W[jj]C[On a small board, the center is worth less than on a full sized board. Better to make a shimari in the top left or bottom left.]

;B[ch]C[I wasn't really sure how to respond to this];W[cj];B[eh]

(;W[jf]C[This move plays near black's strong area, so black can ignore it to play elsewhere. Also, again, remember that the center is less important than the edge in a small board. If black does respond, then the move will work okay, you will have built up strenght to attack the group on the left. But if black ignores, then you could be in trouble.]
;B[fk]C[looking back, I should have done something about this, but I am not sure what]

(;W[kh];B[li];W[ki];B[lh]TR[ei][fi][ej][fj]C[A move aound here could disconnect the two black stones on the left side. Then you can fight. When you have influence, like your big group in the center, you need to use it to fight.]

(;W[hf]C[This move is too colse to your center group. It's true that the center group is lacking eye shape and is in danger, but it also has lots of liberties. It needs to fight. Time to attack the black group on the left.]
;B[gh];W[hh];B[ie];W[if]C[This is miserable. So overconcentrated for white!]
;B[hk];W[ef];B[el]
(;W[ff]C[It's good to connect groups, but black is ahead on territory, so you don't have the luxury to play this way. You have to attack the group in the left center and hope that your center group can live on its own or connect out later.]
;B[ei]
(;W[fj]C[this was probably a dumb move, but I feel like I have already lost at this point]
;B[ej]C[playing here destroys your chance to play the connecting tesjui. The time to try cutting here was earlier.]
;W[gi];B[cl];W[dl];B[bk]C[Is there a way I could have killed b3 and c2?]
;W[ek]C[These sorts of moves just waste potential. You could use them later as ko thereats. There is no way to live directly.]
;B[fl];W[ck];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh];W[bj];B[dm]C[The game is essentially over now. White cannot catch up.]

(;B[ei];W[hk]TR[ch][eh][ei]SQ[fj][fk]C[White disconnects black into two weak groups! It may be impossible for black to ive with both of them. If he does live with both, then it will be at great expense, with white gaining in strength.]

(;B[gi];W[fh];B[gj];W[eg];B[gh];W[fg];B[ih]C[Now there will be a fight between the two center groups, but it is a fair fight. White has more liberties, though black has as trong position on the right side.]
;W[hf])
(;B[ef];W[gi]))
(;B[hk];W[ei]C[Maybe better for black to play this way, keeping his left side group lighter.]
)))
(;W[hk]C[This move may still be helpful.])
(;W[kf]TR[jf]SQ[hj][ij][jj]C[If you're playing in this general area, this move is stronger. It puts a little bit of pressure on black's corner position in the top right and also threatens to play L4, creating some territory on the right side and plenty of eye space for the group on the right side. The one stone is weaker than the three stones, so play near the one stone. Don't play near your wall.]
))
(;W[hk]C[This move makes a nice potential territory on the bottom, and mostly connects this group to white's bottom left group. Since white has no weaknesses left on the board, black's group on the left is now in a lot of danger.]
