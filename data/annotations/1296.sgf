;B[dd]C[While we were recording these moves, we  somehow messed up right after 75 and lost some  moves.  So, I have only included up to this point.   We are basically only looking for a review of how  the opening was played.    Black and I are good  friends and we are both interested in this review .]
;W[pp];B[oc];W[cp];B[cj]LB[qn:A][nq:B][ep:C][eq:D]C[Micke: An approach around A, B or C/D would be a more classical way of playing, but the extension that was played is also a good point.]
;W[pe]LB[qd:A][qe:B]C[I wasn't sure if this should be here or at R15

Micke: This is perfectly ok! (See variation for a standard continuation.) If you want to play a move on the third line, I would recommend A instead of B.]

(;B[qc]LB[qd:A]C[Micke: Shows the right way of thinking, but better at A.]
;W[qj]LB[qi:A][re:B]C[I think this was a mistake on my part because it  allows some nasty play at S15 for black.  I knew my  opponent pretty well though, and I had a feeling he  would attack elsewhere and not pay proper attention  to this.

Micke: I agree, the extension is a bit too wide. I think A is better. But black B is not a real problem, since all black will get is a few points of territory. (See variation.)]

(;B[dn];W[fq]LB[ep:A]C[Micke: Too low, better at A.];B[ep];W[eq]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[co];W[bp];B[fp];W[hq];B[qq]LB[qn:A][nq:B]C[We discussed this move after the game, and as it  turns out his strategy was to invade here, and end  up sacrificing the stones, while attacking along line  P.  His idea was to use the corner stones as a  threat so that he could make a large center territory.

My feeling was that this move might not have been  big enough right now and maybe S15 or something  like that may have been.

Micke: Black's strategy is not sound. If you want to build territory in the center, you should not invade under the 4-4 stone. (Look at the variation showing the standard joseki to see why.) S15 is still small. I can find three interesting areas to play. An approach at A or maybe B. Alternatively a move on the upper side to make a big moyo.]

(;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[po]LB[ro:A]C[Micke: Terrible overplay. :-) Should be at A. Black can not get a good position from this.]
;W[qr]LB[ro:A]C[Micke: Maybe A is more severe, but this is also ok.]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pn]TR[po]C[Micke: Trying to do too much at once. The marked stone must be sacrificed. The corner is too important now.]
;W[om];B[no]C[Here is where he starts to build up the territory in  the center.

Micke: No no no no... :-) The black stones are on the run! They can't make territory as long as they are not secure.]
;W[pm];B[nn];W[ne]LB[ml:A]C[I decided here that a big move would be at N8, but i  wasn't able to decide how big.  I new N8 would help  me make a lot of side territory but I wanted to build  the top edge of that territory first.  I also felt that S3  would be big as it helps to kill that group on the  right.  I really wasn't sure which was best here.

Micke: A white stone at A would be more or less sente, so that is what should be done first. Then, I would kill the black corner. The played move is also a good point, though, but not at all urgent.]
;B[jo];W[mq]TR[pp][pq][qr]C[Micke: If you want to make the marked stones safe, kill the corner!]
;B[jq];W[kr];B[kq];W[lq];B[lp];W[fc]TR[ne]LB[ml:A]C[With the right group at the bottom close to alive in  my mind, I thought that either this move or N8 was  the biggest.

Micke: You are right. (A is the key point of both the black and white moyos.) Now, S15 is starting to look interesting from a black point of view. It will reduce white's territory in sente. Not just make own territory as before. See the difference? (The marked stone holds the answer.)]
;B[ec]C[Micke: Bad move, see variation for continuation.]
(;W[eb]LB[cc:A]C[Micke: Bad move. White wants to keep an eye on an invasion at A. This can not happen after this sequence.]
;B[db];W[gb]C[Micke: Too low. Black gets a lot of almost secure territory.]
;B[fd]C[Micke: Good move.];W[gd];B[fe];W[ge];B[gf];W[mc];B[qe]
LB[re:A]C[Micke: A is better, but the direction of play is correct.]
;W[qf];B[re];W[pd];B[nb];W[mb];B[pc];W[qg];B[ml]C[And black finally took N8.  Knowing how much this  confines my territory on the right, I felt that perhaps  returning the favor on the left would be best.   In my  mind this was better than defending the white  territory as it gets reduced, and then black expands  his on the left.  So I played the following:

Micke: Yes, defending the white territory would let black expand on a huge scale.]

(;W[if]LB[hf:A]C[Micke: I have a feeling that the game is over now. Black has more potential territory and white still has to spend one more move to kill the lower right corner. By the way, A is better. (See variation.)]

(;B[kj]C[I was surprised by this, because I felt that Black  would have responded either J12 or H13.

Micke: I would have played H14. (See variation.)];W[ih]C[Micke: Yes, reduce!]
;B[ij]LB[gh:A]C[Micke: Wrong direction. Better at A.];W[gh]
C[Micke: Good.];B[eh]C[I was satisfied with this result as I felt that I had  reduced black a lot on the left]
;W[mh];B[fg];W[hf];B[nj];W[oh];B[nq];W[nr];B[mp];W[oq];B[kp]
LB[sh:A][sg:B]C[And it is right here that we lost track of the moves.  I  did eventually take at O3, so we are sure that it is  correct to this point.  Big moves that we played later  are:

1:  wS3 bS4 wT3 bS7 wS8  winning the corner for  white

2:  wG13 bF14 wF11 and I reduced black furthur

3: bT13 wS14 bT14 wS12 bT12 wS11 bT11 wT10  where black reduced my side territory.

4: wb6

Thank you very much for any commentary you can  supply for this game.

Micke:
1. Worth around 20 points.
2. Not so big. Black does not have to answer G13. G14 is not an important stone to save.
3. See variation for the monkey-jump tesuji, where black jumps all the way to A instead of B.
4. Good move!

O3 is very small. (2 points in gote.)]
