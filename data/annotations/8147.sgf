C[Hello and thanks for the review. This was a really close game that I honestly thought I had lost. I know I made certain mistakes but I was wondering if there are any I missed. Thanks again.

Hi, my name is Pavel. I'm 8k at KGS. My comments will be marked as P:]

;W[np];B[pk];W[jc]C[P: By my opinion, this move is quite passive, since it does not put pressure on black and allows him to invade yor territory ar bottom.]

P: Well, that was all.

I would like to say couple of words about you overall style of play.

You should learn to see sente moves. The moves that will make your opponent to answer defensively.
If you want to make a big move, which does not put pressure on your opponent, first try to make aggressive moves which will definitely make your enemy defend, and try to get as much as you can of that moves - a bit of territory, a wall of stones or whatever... And only after that make a big passive move and give initiative to your opponent.
However you must not forget to estimate the situaion on the board from the point of view of your opponent, it may happen, that it would be better for your rival to ignore your aggrssive move, and make some other big move.]
