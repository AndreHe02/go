C[Dear Reviewer:

Thanks for taking the time to look at this.  The whole game developed from a huge fight in the lower right, probably from a misplayed joseki sequence.  I got clobbered, although I found at least one line at move 47 which would have gotten me out of immediate trouble.

I think the game was basically lost by move 70.  I found a couple of tesuji later, but never came close after that.  Was there a way out after losing the bottom?  Thanks.

Forfun (hereafter ff):  This was a very interesting game to review.  It is actually about three different games.  Unfortunately Black only won the middle one.

Sorry but there is just too much to comment on if we review the entire middle game.  I would like to concentrate on the early game including the first big fight on the lower side.  Black misses a big chance to cut White during the fight and, as a result, loses a group.  Black found the missed cut later as indicated in the notes so I will concentrate on other aspects.  I think both players could improve quickly by concentrating more on the direction of play.  Both Black and White turn away from the main issue at several key points.  We all need to understand our own mistakes and also those of our opponents.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qi];W[nq];B[pn];W[jp]
(;B[fd]C[ff - This is one possible approach.  However, the play at F17 is normal and good.  In this situation it is better.  See the variation...

The high approach to a 4-4 stone gives away too much on the left side.  It stakes everything on building up the upper and right sides.  The main weakness is that it has no good follow up at C17, which is normally a fundamental weakness of the 4-4 stone.  

When it is played at the professional level, the high approach is normally in relation to a much more developed position on the right side.  However, the normal Chinese fuseki position in the upper right is fundamentally a low, fighting position.  Therefore the relationship with F16 can not be especially good - not sufficiently for giving White a better than average result on the left side.]
;W[df]
(;B[dc]C[ff - This is the most common continuation after the F16, D14 exchange.  However, here Black makes this worse by further solidifying White and creating some not very helpful stones that could become a target later.  I think Black would have been better to have simply extended along the top to K16.  See the variation...]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[cb]
(;B[cn]C[ff - Black tries too hard here.  Black has to continue and finish the upper side.  See the variation...]

(;W[cl]C[ff - White very kindly follows Black around the board.  Although this is sufficient to give a good result in relation to both the bottom and the upper left.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[bn];W[em]
(;B[ic]C[ff - Since White ends in gote on the bottom, Black can repair the defect in the upper left.  However, J17 is a very tight defensive play.  It should probably be at K16 instead.  The point is how to think about this position.  Which side of the top is more important: the upper left or the upper right?  The upper left corner is played out.  A question remains of whether White will jump out or Black will jump up to the area around F14.  However, against that the upper right is wide open.  Black should want to play a stone here that influences the upper right.  J17 does not do that effectively.]

(;W[nn]C[ff - This is the crux of this game.  First of all we should consider whether this is a good play by White at this time?  The two-space jump looks big in relation to the wall on the far left.  However, it is thin and it is actually quite close to the stone on K4.  Black should not fear this play.  There are alternatives that White could have equally considered.  See the variations...]

(;B[np]C[ff - Black immediately attacks the thinness of White's jump.  This is natural and reasonable.  It is not the only approach that Black might adopt (see the variations) but it is the one that White most has to consider in deciding to jump out.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mo]
(;B[oq]C[ff - Black becomes confused over the objective here.  If Black wanted to protect the corner, the plays at O4 and O5 were unnecessary.  If Black wants to cut at N4, this play strengthens White.  See the variation...]
;W[nr]C[ff - Black has not yet protected R3 and White is stronger along the bottom.]
;B[mn];W[nm];B[ln]C[RickMott: Is extending and fighting here reasonable?  Is there a better way to deal with the emerging white moyo on the bottom?

ff - The timing of this question is wrong :-)  Black has to ask (and answer) this question before playing  N6, ideally before playing O4!]

(;W[pl]C[ff - White goes in the wrong direction with this play.  It does not threaten Black's corner because the White stones are too weak.  This is a great opportunity that Black misses.]

(;B[or]C[ff - Unnecessary.  If Black can not ignore Q8, then cutting and fighting is unreasonable.  See the variation...]
;W[ll]C[ff - White is smiling now.];B[jn]
(;W[ho]C[ff - This is a mistake in direction.  White pushes Black out of the bottom into the center.  White should keep pushing Black to the left until the Black stones run into the wall on the left...]
;B[kl];W[lq]C[ff - Basically White turns away from the fight at a critical moment.  Note that if Black cuts at N3 before the Black stones escape, White just sacrifices O2 and O3 since they have no meaning in the fight.]

(;B[ml]C[ff - This looks dangerous since both sides get cut here.  See the variation...  On the other hand, Black is definitely stronger in this area now, so...]
;W[mm];B[lm];W[lk];B[nk]C[ff - A nice play although it is unfortunate that Black did not find the right follow up.  It looks like White is in more trouble here than Black.]
;W[pj]
(;B[pi]C[RickMott: Thoughless reflex move.  Found a better one.  P8 captures the cutting stones or makes me good on the outside.

ff - It is a pity that Black did not spot the weakness in White's position.  If Black considers White's position solid then the subsequent plays in this area are not logical.  Let's see what we mean...]
;W[oj]
(;B[nj]C[ff - This forces White to weaken the Black stones in the area.  Assuming that the White stones are uncuttable, Black should want to give up the two stones in the center on a small scale.  See the variation...]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[oh]C[ff - Black forces White out into Black's largest potential area.  This would actually be an impressive way of playing on a grand scale if Black turned back now and cut White apart!  :-)]
;B[qf];W[kk];B[jl]C[RickMott: Very complicated.  Not clear who is attacking whom.]
;W[mh];B[lj]C[RickMott: Dumb.  Should give up the 4 stones, play K9?

ff - By now it is rather difficult to give up the stones.  Compared to the previous variation, White will do well enough with the larger-scale capture to have a solid lead.  Really Black has to see the cut around here to make sense out of the play up to this point.]
;W[ki];B[kj];W[jk];B[jj];W[ik];B[il];W[hl];B[hm];W[hk]
(;B[gm]C[ff - Black looks dead here.];W[in];B[im];W[fk]C[RickMott: Am I lost at this point, or do the variations make it possible to keep playing?  They sure seem better than what I actually did.

ff - Basically I think it is time for Black to move on to the next game.  Having said that, Black gets back into this game and is leading toward the end until the ko that occurs in the upper right.  There are really about three different games wrapped up in this record.  It is beyond the limits of my stamina to give it all the analysis it deserves.

My comments end here except for a couple concerning the situation surrounding the ko at the end.]
