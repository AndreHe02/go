AB[pd][dp]C[dear reviewer
i am white and  i am not proud of this game  how could i have played more aggressively against tha weaker player?

orionsky:
The most important thing to note is, that a two stone handicap game is nearly even, so don't try too fancy things.
You played a very patient fuseki and should have carried on in this manner.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[dj];W[fq];B[dn];W[jp];B[dq]
C[orionsky:
So far a quite normal opening. When you play this way as white it shows that you expect black to make mistakes without you forcing him. Accordingly, you should stick to your patient style.]
;W[fc];B[df]
(;W[db]C[orionsky:
The first move I don't like too much. White gets a tiny position on the top (see var).]
;B[cc];W[ic];B[kc]C[orionsky:
Perfect for Black];W[qc]LB[np:a]C[is it ok or dangerous given my moyo below?

orionsky:
Hm, if you want your moyo to become bigger, this is certainly the wrong approach.
A play at a (O4) would be consistent with your strategy up to now.]
;B[qd];W[pb]C[orionsky:
Hm? Usually you play here when you need to live quickly. Hane at S16 gives you a bigger corner, the outside will be damaged anyway.]
;B[oc];W[ob];B[nb];W[rc];B[rd];W[sc]C[orionsky:
This is close to the worst line of play I can imagine for White. You are completely sealed in without any significant amount of territory.]
;B[sd]LB[ql:a]C[orionsky:
Black should have invaded around a (r8), using his thickness to rip Whites moyo apart. Nevertheless Black seems better now.]
;W[dl]C[orionsky:
See? You think you need to do something (which is actually true) and you consequently cannot stick to your initial strategy of forcing Black into action.
With this target and a solid position around, Black should not have too many problems handling this position.]
;B[ek]LB[hd:a][hc:b][fd:c]C[orionsky:
Good response by Black. Aims at Black a (H16), Whits b (H 17), Black c (F 16), building a nice moyo.]
;W[em];B[cj];W[cl]LB[fo:a]C[orionsky:
This seems to be an overplay since B could continue his attack at a (F5). Whites group is heavy and has to run into the center so Black will both work on his potential moyo on the top and reduce the White moyo on the bottom.]
;B[cn]C[orionsky:
Too soft.];W[fn]LB[gm:a][fp:b]C[orionsky:
Hm, you want to run away quickly, better play a (G 7). Now Black can aim at a splitting attack at b (F4). Moreover, White a has a greater effect on the rest of the board.]
;B[nq];W[oq]C[is it ok?

orionsky:
Yes, you hardly have a choice although this move does not have the effect you probably hoped for.]
;B[np];W[pn];B[kq];W[jq]C[anything else i can do?

orionsky:
No, this move is important for keeping the left white group out of trouble.]
;B[kp];W[nn];B[oo]C[orionsky:
Aji-keshi. This is exactly what white wants.];W[po];B[kn];W[jo]
;B[ko];W[of]C[does not seem right?

orionsky:
This move is too ambitious considering that Black has a strong position on the top.]
;B[qj]LB[qh:a]C[orionsky:
Tough, but seems justified with Blacks strength on the top.
Personally, I would have preferred a (R12) which is farther from the Black group around N3 which is still vulnerable to an attack.]
;W[qk]C[orionsky:
Seems to be the only move];B[qi]
(;W[rk]LB[pi:a]C[orionsky:

;B[oh];W[ph];B[oi];W[rj]LB[nj:a]C[orionsky:
Bad mistake, white is connected anyway. A move at a (O10) is an urgent point for the shape of both groups.]

Now with the potentially weak Black groups connected the game is over.]
;W[fe]C[ok?

orionsky:
Seems ok for an endgame move. However, the game is already decided.]
;B[nr];W[or];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro]LB[rr:a]C[orionsky:
Should be at a (S2). Black can force ko otherwise (see var).]

Pushing once is important.];B[qh];W[rk];B[ph];W[oh]C[orionsky:
Now white has not lost too much (except his former potential territory).]
))
(;W[lc]C[orionsky:
Since black played very territory oriented, he is unlikey to invade between the two stones.
Even if he does, the point at C17 is left open so that you need not worry about the stone at F17.]
;B[mc];W[ld];B[rd];W[hd]C[orionsky:
Now white has established a good position on the top and black didn't gain too much in the UR corner.
Maybe this var is a bit too optimistic but I think it shows the right approach.]
