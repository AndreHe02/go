C[My name is Frank and I will be doing this review.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].  My general feeling about this game is that you assign to little of a value to influence.  He builds a huge moyo and you seem like you don't care, continuing to separate your groups.  It's hard to say how strong your opponent was because I think you beat yourself.  When a player has strong influence in an area, it is like there is a handicap there.  That player will have an advantage in all fights there.  In this game, he built big influence in lots of places and had the advantage in many fights.  My advice to you would be to try to learn more about influence.  This can be done by watching higher level games, dan or pro, and think about what the influence means in those games.  Try to observe the fights in the areas where one player has more influence than the other.  Another thing you can do is to just try to play some games where you are the one developing the influence.  Try the sanrensei opening and mimic the strategy used by your opponent here.  As a sidenote, Takemiya Masaki 9p is one of the best in the world at developing big moyos.

His games are available here.

I'm white against a seemingly stronger player. I feel I was matching
him for much of the game but erred by playing too territorially??
and allowing him too much influence. Would appreciate more correct
assessment
of what was going on and how accurate my comments are.];B[pd]

;W[dd];B[pj];W[nc];B[jd]C[[Frank\] I may just play joseki here.  It will otherwise be difficult to play against  the thickness.]

[Frank\] Definitely.];B[pn]
(;W[qo]C[not sure about this

[Frank\] This is very forceful.  Think twice before separating your stones and strengthening your opponent.  I do not like this move.  See variation.]
;B[po];W[qp];B[qn];W[pq];B[oq];W[pr];B[or]C[i do have p4 but when??

[Frank\] Definitely not now.  He also does not need to protected until you protected R3.]

(;W[rn];B[rm];W[sr]C[looks totally wrong but i was just looking for a move that lived
easily]
(;B[ro];W[rp];B[sn];W[hp]C[i think i'm ok in corner so tenuki. Am I. His moyo is looking
big so
perhaps i was wrong in taking the corners. I considered starting
a fight with p4 but decided against? Correct?? How about  moves
around q11 to reduce??

[Frank\] Are you sure the corner is ok?  (I don't think so)]

(;B[dp];W[dq];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[gq];B[dl];W[cp];B[dn]C[have i been too territorial?

[Frank\] Perhaps a little. I would much prefer to be B here.]

;B[op];W[mm];B[mk];W[kn];B[io];W[im];B[ho];W[jq]C[trying to link up but perhaps not necessary??]
;B[kq];W[kp];B[iq];W[jr];B[ip];W[kr]C[perhaps j2 would have been better since l3 is still trapped?

[Frank\] Yes.];B[hr];W[hc]C[his h2 seemed big but gote. i don't think i can attack his f4
group - it looks too strong?? so i try a big move but perhaps
i forgot about his moyo??

[Frank\] I think your move is ok here.];B[he];W[fd];B[cd]C[[Frank\] Essentially two choices here.  You must follow through though.]

(;W[ce]C[looks like something goes horribly wrong in the next few moves
because black gets too good a result. It would help if i knew
some joseki!

[Frank\] In this case, you give him the corner.  Be sure he stays in corner no batter what!]

[Frank\] His moyo is very big at this point.];B[ci];W[bi];B[cj]

of course];B[li];W[gf]C[trying to connect and also with a view to attacking k16 - too
optimistic??];B[bg];W[bh];B[af];W[bm]C[b7 was wrong i think. b6 would have connected or made enough
room too live i think.

That was my last chance i think. The rest of the game goes downhill
as i try too attack k16 but it backfires horribly.];B[bn];W[an]
