C[I play as white 5k on IGS verses suesaiga 6k+, 0.5 komi.

I'm not very familiar with beginning play, and that is probably my biggest weakness.  Any comments on that would be appreciated.  As this was an unusual opening for me, I couldn't really figure out what the large points to play were.
Thanks :)

Jay: It is tough for all of us amatures. I will do the best.]

Jay: Direct jump is better.];B[oi];W[lk];B[nf];W[qn]C[I wanted some support for my running group, but since it's pretty much out, maybe I should have gone to r4 or r3, so that I could get the corner, and any influence he gains for the outside would be negated by the running group?

Jay: Your endgame is better than your opponent. In fact, B is winning at this point. But, lost the game in the end. This move, for example is 8 pts in gote. D18 area is bigger and sente. E18 is reversed sente, also is fixs the problem at D16. See my next comment. Overall, this is a fighting game from start.]
