C[Dear reviewer,

In recent games I've frequently ended up in trouble because of extending too far, overplaying or rushing into a new place without properly taking care of previous situation first (that is, leave too much aji behind). I would mostly be interested in these aspects of my game, but of course any comments are more than welcome.

In this game I played white and won by resignation. The game was quite close until a misread by the opponent late in yose. I felt I should have lost this game as there were a few places where the opponent should have punished me.

Thank you very much for your time!

Comments by Az];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc]C[I tried to lure opponent into D15 so that by playing the usual joseki I could get sente and play at P16.

Az: Standard fuseki, ok.];B[de];W[ce]C[Az: A little odd. Why are you helping him build thickness towards your LL corner? A pincer or tenuki seems more natural.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[dg];W[fc];B[ck];W[od]C[It all went according to the plan, but was this play OK?

Az: Wrong direction. F17 is low, so it's strong, but doesn't have a lot of room for expansion. Q5 would make more sense, this way you're in danger of getting over concentrated on the top]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[qf]C[At this point (yes, very late ;) I realized that I was going to lose sente, so decided to leave upper side as it is and go elsewhere. This leaves a lot of aji around M17 region (where my opponent later played), but any play op there seemed too slow and not so big as the area around R5. Perhaps I should not have played P16 in the first place?

Az: Tenuki is a good idea, see previous comment.];W[cm]C[Wanted to first play here and then go to lower right corner. A play by black around C6 would have given him too much (I think), so needed somethin here. In retrospect this looks rather thin to me and I am not entirely sure if C7-E9 exchange is good for white or not. C6 seems too slow and is probably not even sente, so decided to play C7 anyway.

Az: This is ok, but you probably need to followup to defend the corner in gote afterward.]
;B[ek]C[Now white corner seems rather vulnerable and would need another move there, but once again I felt there's no time for that and left it as it is.]
;W[qn]C[Is this approach reasonable? Perhaps something like R8 would have been better, as that would have given me a base quite easily. I was afraid that that way black would get big corner, but as it happeded, black got quite a big wall and might (should) have gotten a big center as a result.

Az: D3 is urgent. Then you have miai between playing kikari like this or extending to k3 if he plays in the corner.]
;B[ql];W[rq]C[This seems too submissive. I wanted a base quickly, but black got rather appalling wall as a result.

Az: !?
This is not a good move. If you want a base quickly R3 is joseki. If you want to run out there are other options like Q4.]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[qo];W[ro];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[iq]C[Needed something here quick. A black play somewhere here would have been a disaster. When I look at this stone now, it seems a bit lost. Perhaps it should have been a bit closer to my own corner?

Az: Should follow up with S8, it is sente for both sides and would have a huge effect on the upper side if he got it.

This seems like a compromise that doesn't quite work. If you are going to extend to block his wall, play K3. If you want to help your corner, E3.]
;B[dq];W[cq]C[Az: Questionable decision, I think W should hane on the other side since you don't want to isolate the J3 stone with his wall right there.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[eq];B[dr];W[er]C[Az: Connecting at E4 is correct. This way you end in gote, which is no good.]
;B[cr];W[bo];B[bq];W[eo]C[After giving black the corner, J3 suddenly seems too close and overconcentrated. So the question is: where should it have been in the first place? And was giving up the corner the right decision?

Az: Giving up the corner was the right idea, though your initial move suggested you were going to keep it. The problem was E2 - if you hadn't played it, would you play it now?]
;B[lq];W[ef]C[This was probably a mistake. Should have first played something like K16? Or perhaps P14?

Az: I think S8 is still more urgent, letting B get that in sente is unbearable. As far as the top, I don't know what's best: the peep destroys the aji at C12, but it also helps the top out. P14 is a bit conservative, you could think about O13 if you go that direction.]
;B[lc];W[ld]C[Az: Must be N18, only move];B[kc];W[df];B[cg]
;W[eg]C[This move does not seem so urgent now. Perhaps should have played something like L16, J17 or L16?

Az: N18. Keep black from connecting, otherwise you got robbed.]
;B[hc];W[kd];B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[mb];B[hf];W[og];B[rl];W[pr]
;B[or];W[qr];B[oq]C[This I think was quite a mistake by black. I think he should have played somewhere in the middle or in the right side.

Az: Yup];W[ph];B[jf]C[Seems like another small play by black. I feel I only won because of these moves and not because I played well.

Az: This isn't as small as P3, since he is trying to prevent you from playing H12]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[jo]C[Az: This is a bit vague. S7 is sente because of the threat of a cut. If not that, how about C11 to make use of your stone at E13?]
;B[rn]C[Unfortunately I had not read that this is sente.];W[sr]
;B[ln];W[jm]C[Here is another thin play. Ended up backfiring in a bad way.]
;B[in];W[jn];B[fp];W[ep];B[jq];W[jp]C[Wanted to play here (and not J4) to threaten K3 stone. Otherwise J6 would have gotten away.]
;B[kq];W[gm]C[Az: Got to be H4. This way he can just push under and do at least as much damage as he would by pulling his stone out]
;B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[il];W[im];B[hl];W[hm]C[This does not look like a good result for me.]
;B[gl]C[This seems like a big mistake by black. I was expecting E12.]
;W[eh]C[Az: Again, C11 better];B[di];W[lg];B[kl];W[rh];B[rg]
;W[qg]C[Don't know if this is an overplay. Black Q14-Q13 would have captured this stone, but not cause any more serious problems. Perhaps a more solid play would have been better. Or Q10...]
;B[sf];W[li]C[Az: Both sides keep making moves that float in the middle of nowhere without claiming much profit. How about W E11 / B D10 / W F8, try to cut and attack.]
;B[qi];W[qh];B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[oj];B[nk];W[nj]C[Hmm... rather stupid move by me I think.

The rest is just yose and I don't have any particular questions about that. I would be mainly interested in the game this far, but of course if you have time and interest, I would naturally be glad to hear comments regarding yose as well.

Not a terrible game, just some listliss moves in the late middle game. If you have any followup questions feel free to add them to the record and send the game back to me.
