I Speak spanish but I understand english as well...

SO, I used to play with Mr. Masanao Huehara, he's 2d (amateur) and I'm beginner.
We have playing around for a year (more or less) and I'm trying to play better, I bought some books, and programs, and since a couple of months, I'm trying to play on the net (NR).
After this match, he told me "put 6 or 7 stones", I'm really trying to play better, but I can't...

ESPAÑOL:

Bueno, yo acostumbro a jugar con el Sr. Masanao Huehara (2 dan amateur), y yo estoy empezando.
Bueno, aunque hemos jugado por 2 años (más o menos) y he tratado de jugar mejor, he comprado algunos libros básicos, programas, y desde hace un par de meses, he tratado de jugar en Internet (aun no tengo ranking).
Despúes de este partido me dijo que mejor pusiese  6 o 7 piedras, y aun así NO he podido ganar NI UN PARTIDO...

samtregar:  Hello Enrique. Thank you for allowing me to review your game.  Unfortunately, the Spanish I learned in school isn't enough to write a Go review, so you'll have to make do with my English.  All my comments will start with "samtregar:".

samtregar: I play on KGS at around 15k.  This means that I should be able to give you some ideas about your moves, but the moves of your opponent are well beyond my ability to critique.  Also, when I show a variation please keep in mind that your opponent would probably not play the way I did.  You might want to send my review to him so that he can provide additional comments and tell you where I went wrong.

samtregar: Please feel free to contact me with questions about this review.  You can email me at sam@tregar.com or catch me on KGS.]
;W[qn];B[mp]LB[ql:C][np:A][nq:B]C["PRIORITY OF EXTENSION" I read it in the book "basic technic of Go".
 Well, now I think I had to play "corner enclosure", but where?

samtregar: I might have played at A or B.  Both moves are slower, but also more secure.  My philosophy when playing handicap games against better players is to play the safest move that won't be too slow.  Another possibility is the pincer at C.

samtregar: since you are on the 4/4 point you cannot enclose the corner completely in one move.  Thus, extension or pincer are your two options.]
;W[qp];B[qq];W[pq]MA[qq]C[I loose that stone... Or Can I save it?

samtregar: Yes, I think you can save it with P3.  The best result I can find for white is Ko.  But really, the bigger question is, can you get enough profit from the attack to make it worth your while?  I'm not sure of the answer.  I would probably try to attack, but I'm not certain it is correct.

Español:
¿perdí esa piedra o la puedo salvar?]
(;B[qh]LB[jd:C][qf:B][dj:D][pj:F][qk:A][jp:E]C[I still trying to "extend"...

samtregar: By playing elsewhere you're abandoning the lower right corner to white.  This might not be the best idea.  However, since you decided you cannot save R3 you must find the most efficient move available.  This move is in a strange place.  It's not close enough to the upper right to prevent an invasion around R14 and it's not close enough to white's R6 group to threaten an attack.  I would prefer A or B instead.  Also, any play on or around the remaining star points would be fine (C, D, E and F).

Español:

Tratando de "extender"...];W[oq]C[samtregar: since you didn't play the "normal" move at P3, white decided to play it for you.  He gains territory and threatens your stone at Q4.  It is always good when your moves serve multiple purposes, and for that reason this seems good for white.]
;B[op];W[rq];B[nq]C[samtregar: I don't think this move was necessary.  There are many bigger points available on the board.]
;W[qr]C[samtregar: I am surprised by this move.  It doesn't seem at all urgent.  White is giving you another chance to play a big point.  Take it!]
;B[kq]LB[fq:B][iq:A][jq:C]C[samtregar: much too slow. I would prefer A, B or C to attempt to mark out a larger lower moyo.  The star points are, of course, still begging for a stone.]
;W[po];B[ln]LB[oo:A][fq:B]C[Trying to go to the center...

samtregar: Running to the center is a good idea if your stones are at risk of capture.  Your stones in the lower side are quite strong and don't need to run.  Thus, this is a wasted move.  I would prefer A to keep white from getting influnce facing the top or B to help secure your lower moyo.

Español:

Tratando de ir al centro...];W[oo];B[np];W[qk];B[qf]C[samtregar: very small.  The fact that you had to make this tiny move shows that S12 was  misplaced.]
;W[nl];B[ll];W[oj]TR[rd][sd][qe][re][se][rf][sf][rg][sg][rh]
[sh][lo][lp][lq][mq][kr][lr][mr][ks][ls][ms]SQ[pl][ql][rl][sl]
[pm][qm][rm][sm][pn][rn][sn][qo][ro][so][rp][sp][qq][sq][pr]
[rr][sr][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[samtregar: at this point in the game you are behind in secure territory.  I've marked out the territorial balance as I see it.  White has around 25 points and you have around 21.  You can see how much white has gained by taking the corner away from you.  Also, you can see that you have done very little to mark out secure territory yourself.  However, due to the handicap you're still very much in the game. With a few good moves you could be in the lead soon.]
;B[oi]C[samtregar: this move helps white more than it hurts him.  He gets to make a move that he probably would have made eventually anyway.  This is called a "thank-you" move.]
;W[mj];B[lj]C[samtregar: again, by playing against white's wall you meerly help him soldify his territory.]
;W[li];B[kj]LB[jd:A][dj:B]C[I was worried for the stone in the center.

samtregar: why?  It is just one stone.  Always remember, Go is won by enclosing territory, not by capture.  White is marking out territory on the lower right and just burst  through your line into the top.  You should be worried about building secure territory of your own, perhaps on the lower side.  Also, plays around A and B look very ripe!

samtregar: Janice Kim (1d) has a saying in her books, "rush to plant your flag".  This means that unless you have a group in immediate danger it is better to play in an open space than to play further small moves around the group.

Español:

Estaba preocupada por la piedra del centro.];W[qj];B[pi];W[ni]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[pj]C[Trying to cut...
Now I Know I can't.

samtregar: Yes, white is much too strong to be killed or split.  Also, when playing against a stronger opponent you cannot hope for mistakes.  Instead, you must play solid moves that you believe cannot fail.  Actually, this is a good idea against weak opponents too.  However, this move is sente, so it doesn't hurt you to play it.

Español:

Tratando de cortar...
Ahora ya sé que no puedo.];W[pk];B[nf]TR[of][pf][og][pg][oh]
[ph]C[samtregar: very small.  You may gain perhaps six points of territory in this move.  This early in the game you should be looking for moves with much greater potential.]
;W[lf];B[mc]C[samtregar: I like this move.  It extends from the upper left corner and starts to secure some territory on the top.  However, it does not enclose the corner.  A 3/3 invasion will still work.]
;W[lc]C[Why so close?

samtregar: I'm not sure.  I think white expected you to respond at M16.  See the variation for an idea.

Español:

¿Por que tan cerca?]
(;B[ic]LB[fc:B][ic:C][jc:D][dd:A]C[The pincer?

samtregar: this stone is too far from A.  It invites white to attack somewhere around B and break up the top area.  I think it is also too far from C to act as a pincer.  Maybe D would have worked that way, but I'm not sure.

Español:

¿La pinza?];W[md];B[nd]C[samtregar: this should have been at O17.  The cut you left is very dangerous.]
;W[mb];B[nc];W[nb];B[ob];W[me];B[ne];W[kb];B[jd]LB[fc:A][ic:B]
[dd:C]C[samtregar: this move is not threatening and doesn't increase your territory at all.  Much better would have been A.  This is an "ideal" extension since it forms a good connection with both B and C.]
;W[jh];B[hi]LB[cj:A][fp:D][fq:C][hq:B]C[samtregar: this move appears to hope to enclose the entire left side of the board.  That's too much to ask!  Instead, you should be working on securing territory along the edge, with A, B, C or D, for example.  Particularly against a strong opponent you must be constantly concerned with building secure territory.  You can count on him to exploit any weakness, so you must be sure not to leave any.]
;W[hg];B[fe]C[samtregar: this move is too far from the edge to enclose much territory and it's too far from white to be much of a threat.]
;W[fg];B[dg];W[gi];B[gh]C[I was expecting H12...

Español:

Esperaba H12...];W[gg];B[hh];W[fh];B[ij];W[ef];B[df];W[ee];B[ed]
;W[de]C[sam:tregar: the corner is still not secure.  With just a stone at the 4/4 point you need at least three stones to fully secure a corner.  When white breaks through you are in a bad position.]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[he]LB[cc:A]C[samtregar: a very poor move.  You must defend the corner now or you will lose it all!  A move at A would be my first thought, although I am not sure of the result.]
;W[if];B[je];W[bd];B[cc]C[samtregar: too late!];W[bc];B[cb]
;W[bb];B[eb]MA[eb]C[It works?

samtregar: This move is not necessary right now, but it seems secure enough.  You lose this area due to another mistake later.

Español:

¿Eso funciona?];W[cf];B[ch];W[ej];B[gk];W[fj];B[cm]LB[cn:A]
C[samtregar: too far.  A would be much better.  You seem to like the long-knight move from the 4/4 point.  I don't think it is a very good move because it leaves you open to invasion.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[cl];B[el];W[bm];B[cn];W[bn];B[bo]
;W[fq]C[samtregar: White finally playes inside on the lower right.  You had many opportunities to play here yourself, but now it is too late!  Imagine how much better you would be if that was your stone at F3...]
;B[fo]LB[dq:A][eq:C][hq:D][dr:B]C[samtregar: better to protect the corner.  Possiblities include A, B or C.  Or, D might be good too since it will force white into the corner.]
;W[iq]C[samtregar: a two-space jump on the third line is a classic life-building move.  White is probably not killable now.]
;B[er]LB[dq:C][eq:B][dr:A]C[samtregar: this would be better at A, B or C.  You aren't going to kill white, so you might as well try to save as much territory as you can.]
;W[eq];B[dr];W[dq];B[cq];W[fr];B[fs]C[Big mistake?
I guess so...

samtregar: yes, this was a misread.

Español:
¿Gran error?
Eso pienso.];W[gs];B[es];W[cr]MA[dr][er][es][fs]C[Nothing to do... Or not?

samtregar: yes, these stones are dead.  You can force white to kill them with B2, but why bother?

Español:

Nada que hacer ¿o no?];B[bq];W[ds]C[samtregar: I don't understand this move.  White does not need to capture here as far as I can tell.]
;B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[io];B[jp];W[go];B[hn];W[gp];B[gn];W[dl]
;B[dm]LB[em:A]TR[cm][dm][cn]C[samtregar: Beware the empty triangle!  It is almost never the right move.  When you are about to make one, stop and think very carefully.  When your opponent sees you make one he will be sure to try to exploit it.  A better move would be at A]
;W[em];B[en];W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[hm];W[co]C[samtregar: here is why the empty triangle is bad!  It is easy to capture.]
;B[do]C[Now I can't make an eye...

Español:

Ahora no puedo hacer ojos...];W[dn];B[ep]TR[en][bo][do][fo]
[dp][ep][bq][cq]C[samtregar: this group looks vulnerable to me, but in the end it does live.  Maybe white took pity?  See the variation.]

(;W[fn];B[cp];W[eo];B[fp];W[gl];B[cn];W[hl];B[hk]LB[in:A]C[samtregar: of course, this should have been at A to save your group.]
;W[im];B[en];W[dm];B[il]C[Nothing to do.    Español:

Nada por hacer.];W[in];B[jm];W[jn];B[ko]C[Want to save the group below...

Español.

Quiero salvar al grupo de abajo...];W[jl];B[ik];W[km];B[lm]
;W[br];B[ar];W[fd];B[ge]LB[fc:A]C[samtregar: Better at A!  As far as I can tell the cutting stone will die after A.  This moves leaves a lot of bad aji.]
;W[ca];B[da]LB[db:A]C[samtregar: I guess you missed the double atari.  Playing at A would have save the group.  Thus, the stone at E18 was not the problem here, but rather missing the double atari here.]
;W[dc];B[db]LB[ec:A]C[samtregar: given that one group has to die, I would play at A and choose the other.  This move leaves the D19 group in jeopardy after the capture.]
;W[ec]C[I surrender.

SO, thats it. Was worse than others match, but it's the only that I have on PC.

samtregar: Overall, I think you played well considering the vast difference in rank between you and your opponent.  To get stronger, I think you need to spend some time learning about strategy in the opening.  I recommend the book "In The Beginning" and all of Janice Kim's books.  Also, you should study life and death problems which will help you predict when your groups are safe and when your opponents are vulnerable.

samtregar: Thank you again for allowing me to review your game.  I hope it has been as helpful to you as it has been to me.
