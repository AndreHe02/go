C[Dear Reviewer,
thank you very much for reviewing my game. I play as  Karthago83 12k (since one day =D) on IGS.
I was not content with myself on this game, which I played against a 13k+ since I think I made many mistakes and made wrong decisions in fighting, letting him taking my territory but not getting anything in return.
Please supply me with your suggestions! Thanks!

Hello, Karthago83! This is my first review ever for the GTL, so I hope that it's not too bad! I've put comments throughout the game, and tried my best to answer your questions.

From looking at the whole game, the most important piece of advice that I will give you is not to try and kill so much! Many of the problems in this game come from you attacking your opponent whenever you have the chance, and always attacking to kill. If you waste moves trying to kill a group that will live, you can help your opponent to become stronger. It is often a lot more helpful to make your opponent live with a small group when they invade. Then you will gain influence by surrounding them. If you try and kill and they escape, you've made yourself weaker and wasted moves.

So, my advice is not to attack so often. Relax! Your opponent deserves _some_ of the board! When you do attack, don't attack just to kill. Accept that lots of invasions will live, but you can make them live small and come out better due to influence. 

A good book to learn about this idea is Ishida's "Attack and Defense". I think that this book would probably help you a lot.]

The problem with joseki -- your opponent might not know them!]
;W[cc]C[I would agree with this response. It cover the corner and makes sure that your opponent has no easy place to run.]
;B[cf];W[dg]C[Again, a nice response. Pushing straight up strengthens your own group, leans on the black stones and gives you plenty of options.]
;B[bg];W[bh];B[bd];W[bc]C[K: Until here I made a good position, his is cramped and the ladder favours me.

I agree. So far, white is in a nice position.];B[ag];W[ah];B[bf]

(;W[ae]LB[ch:a]C[This is the first move that I really disagree with. Whilst it does threaten black's eye space, the black group has plenty of place to escape, and your own surrounding groups are not that strong themselves.

I would prefer to protect the cutting point at "A" with a stone at C11. See the variation.]

(;B[ad];W[cm]C[K: what about this move? I wanted to extend along the side. Maybe applying more pressure would have been better? He is not alive yet.]
;B[ch]C[Black has taken advantage of the cutting point.];W[ci]
;B[kp]C[The ladder breaker doubles as a nice extension from both corners. This is the problem with leaving ladders dangling unresolved on the board.]
;W[jo]TR[ah][bh][cg][dg][ci]C[K: Is it a good idea to answer a ladder breaker by a counter braker or is capturing usually better?

---

It does depend on the board. In this situation, I would be more tempted to capture. Black's position is still open enough to invade, and there are plenty of big points on the board. Capturing the stone removes the chance of future problems. Make life easy for yourself!

In addition, the white stone stays unused for a lot of the game. Black's ladder breaker is working with his corner stones to cover the lower side. Your stone is just floating in space doing nothing apart from breaking the ladder. If you had used the stone for something else later, it would have been better. As it is, this stone is slightly wasted, and the marked white group stays under threat.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[fe];W[gd];B[co];W[fg]C[K: Here, D14 would have been better, I guess?

---

I would say that F13 is better than D14. Again, D14 won't really achieve anything apart from strengthening black's position. F13 leans nicely on the weak black group, forcing it to run away to live. D14 is a bit heavy.]

;W[fm];B[jd];W[ge]C[K: I thought sealing in sente and then attacking would be a good idea.

---

Yes. This is nice. Force black to defend himself whilst you gain influence.]
;B[df]C[Black is now alive.]
(;W[jf]C[You have safe groups in the top-left corner, and in the middle of the left side. I would rather push black up against that wall and make territory from your top-right corner stone.]

(;B[hc]C[Black tries to live in the wrong direction!];W[kc]
LB[mc:a][nc:b]C[K: I once heard that a shoulder hit from underneath was never a good idea. But I did not want to attach and make his eyespace very small.

---

It's not too bad here. I certainly wouldn't like it played against me! The way that black responded was good for you, but I would be more tempted to play at A or B. These moves would threaten the same thing, but not get you involved in a fight that could go either way. The shoulder hit is a little bit too close.]
;B[jc];W[kd];B[fb];W[gb];B[gc];W[fc];B[hb];W[eb];B[ga]C[K: Was this sente vs one eye exchange favorable for me?

---

Black will now live, but white should be satisfied to seal him off and gain influence to the side and the centre.]

(;W[jb]C[This is attacking too strongly and gives away sente to black. Simply playing at L18 forces a response from black and leaves white free to play elsewhere.]
;B[ib];W[kb];B[eg];W[dh];B[eh];W[ff];B[ef];W[ia]C[This move is aimed at killing black's group, but you'd be better off making sure that he's sealed in. Obviously, you shouldn't let a dead group live, but if there's doubt then you're better off making him live small.]
;B[hd]
(;W[he];B[je]C[K: and alive...

---

It was a fair try. If I wasn't sure about killing black, though, I would have preferred playing on the top and keeping him small to trying to kill with J19.]

(;W[ie]LB[id:a]C[This move is from the wrong side. Black can always respond at A. Don't waste a good ko threat. Forcing moves should be left until they have some purpose.]
;B[id];W[ke]TR[jf]C[Same effect, but different order. A more daring player might have tried to run away through L15. Note also that black can cut through around the marked stone.]
;B[kf]C[... and he does.];W[lf]MA[if][le]TR[kf]C[The marked stones and the cutting points at J14 and M15 are worrying for white. After black runs away with L13, I would prefer to see at least one of these protected.]

(;W[qn];B[me]C[This peek is now very upsetting for white.];W[le]
;B[nc];W[pc];B[ob]
(;W[pb]C[K: I think it should be possible to kill all those stones. Unluckiliy, I did not succeed.

--- 

Again, don't automatically think about killing. Think about making them live in a small area. By trying to kill them, you let them spread out. If you'd tried to seal black in, you would have forced him to live, but gained the side.

Having said that, blocking at Q18 is unnecessary. In this situation, sealing black off from the centre wil leave black with very little space to make eyes.]

---

With the state of the board, there is still plenty of the side to fight over. The centre often becomes much smaller than you might imagine. In this game, with black and white both having easy access to the centre, there is not a lot of territory to be gained there. You should be looking at the bottom edge. Plays at A, B or C would all be very nice for white. D would also be possible, but would put a lot of pressure on the three white stones, so I couldn't recommend it.]

(;W[ac]C[K: I think that this is necessary to make the corner alive, isn't it?

There is also the option of pushing out into the centre. As it is, black would be able to gain a lot by sealing you in.]

Yes. This ko must now be abandoned. You absolutely have to save the group in the lower right.]

Well. It was an interesting game!

It was my first review, and it was a lot harder to do than I imagined! I hope that it wasn't too confused or brief. Do email me if you have any other questions.

As I said at the start, my main advice would be not to focus too much on killing your opponent. There's a lot more to attacking than just trying to kill stones. Think about gaining influence while letting your opponent live in a small area.

The other side of that idea is that there were some very large areas that were open for invasion that you didn't seem to consider. In Go, you can live in very small spaces, and the only way to learn how to do it is to try! Letting black gradually turn the lower left corner into solid territory was very bad for white. If white had jumped in there at any point in the later half of the game, it would have been an easy win for white.

When playing out a ko, try to think about follow-up moves. Don't waste a source of ko threats with one move when you could get two or three ko threats out of it. Similarly, when you are responding to a ko threat, try to think of the response that will stop the opponent from following up with another ko threat. Also, consider whether it's really worth winning a ko that's costing you a lot of points, or whether there's a way to just end it.

I won't mention the loss of the white group in the lower right -- you saw that one!

I hope that this has been helpful. Do feel free to email me with any questions.

Maybe, depending on how the play went. The marked white group will now need to run away or link up to the corner group. If black pushes on you, it could be quite profitable for him. I followed on from your variation a bit.

The way that the game went, this group was saved. What you missed was that the group is under pressure! If black had pushed on it, you could have lost all those stones, which would have been very painful!]
