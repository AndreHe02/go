C[Hello, Thanks for reviewing.  I'm white in this game.

z -- Hello shmolex.  I am Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  I am glad to review your game.  My comments are marked "z --".  Remember that I am also a weak amateur.  So be sure to consider my comments and variations critically - almost certainly, I have made a few mistakes.

z -- I prefer to reference move numbers and board markings in my comments, rather than grid coordinates.  Hopefully you have an SGF reader which displays these properly.  I recommend glGo, which I used to make the review.

z -- I notice that you won this game.  The GTL usually suggests to submit games for review which you have lost.  However, when I study my own play, I find just as many errors in the games I win as in the games I lose.  So I will trust your judgement that this is an appropriate game for review.

z -- I have made a variety of comments, but one stands out above the others.  If you take nothing else from this review, remember the situation in the center from moves 48 to 57.  It is very hard to ignore a pushing battle in the center.

z -- Feel free to contact me with any further questions or comments.  Good luck!]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[cq];B[id];W[qf];B[pi];W[nc];B[of]
(;W[pe]LB[qc:A]C[z -- Black 9 is not a standard move.  What to do about it?

z -- In positions where a double approach is made to a star point stone, playing at the 3-3 point is usually a key move, allowing the invader to settle quickly.  By pushing and cutting, white loses the opportunity to play 3-3.  This contributes to white’s future difficulties.  So, it seems reasonable for white to just play at A now.]

(;B[oe]LB[od:A]C[z -- it might be feasible for black to just push along at A, and swallow up white 8.  Did you consider that?]

(;W[od]LB[qd:A]C[I thought that I would be able to profit on at least 1 side.

z -- that's not so easy, as the game shows.  White A is also possible, even though it goes against the proverb "don't push in if you aren't going to cut".]
;B[qd]
(;W[ri]TR[qf][pe]LB[pc:A]C[z -- this move is painfully low.  I would prefer to leave the marked stones for now, hoping to use their aji later, and develop the stones on the top side.  White A looks reasonable, as it also pressures the black corner stones.]
;B[qg];W[rg]
(;B[qe]LB[rf:A]C[z -- black could connect his corner stones out by playing at A instead.]
;W[pf];B[ob];W[ne];B[oc];W[nd];B[nf];W[pg];B[nb]LB[mf:A]C[z -- black should play at A instead.]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[mb];B[lb];W[mc];B[ma];W[qb];B[pc]
;W[mh];B[ni]
(;W[qh]LB[qj:A]C[z -- if white thinks this group needs a move, then it would be better to play at A, getting up off the second line and contributing to the pressure on black's group.]
;B[lc];W[me];B[mi];W[li];B[lj];W[ld]C[z -- ignoring black 43 takes courage!  But I think it is OK, white 44 threatens much damage.]
;B[kd];W[ke];B[jd]C[z -- good, white has made some eyeshape.]
;W[ed]TR[li][lj]LB[kj:B][ki:A]C[z -- This move is wrong.  The pushing battle at the marked stones must not be ignored.  White should play at A or B instead.]
;B[ec]LB[ki:A]C[I didn't want to hane at f17 because of the k16 stones.  I wasn't sure how to do the avalanche joseki for sure, but I decided to give it a shot.

z -- black should play at A instead.

z -- Locally, it is OK for white to answer black 49 with the hane - see variation next move.]

(;W[ce]LB[ki:C][fc:B][dd:A]C[z -- this move is not good.  Black's response at A is too strong.

z -- White A instead would start the avalanche, but that doesn't seem like a good idea in this position.  White B is OK locally.  See variations.  But if I were white, I would leave this corner and go back to play C.]
;B[dd];W[de];B[fd]LB[ee:A]C[z -- black could cut at A.];W[ee]
;B[bd]LB[ki:A][dj:B]C[That didn't go so well either.

z -- It might have been worse, if black 53 had cut.  Still, black's top side is large, and white has two urgent moves to make: A, or an extension around B.  This is one reason why urgent moves must be made right away: later on, there may be more of them, but we can only place one stone per turn :)]
;W[pl]LB[ki:A][dj:B]C[z -- This move is not the most important.  Per last comment, A and B are urgent.]
;B[ki]C[z -- very important.];W[lh];B[mk];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj]
;B[jk]
(;W[ll]LB[ji:A][ij:B]C[z -- white must play A or B instead.  Black shows why.]
;B[ij];W[ji];B[ii];W[jh];B[lk]C[z -- this result is bad for white.  Black gets influence facing out to the bottom and left, while white's group gets scrunched up.]
;W[jp]SQ[ij][ii]TR[ce][de][ee][ed]LB[di:A]C[z -- an extension at or near A is more urgent.  A black play there would make white's marked stones heavy, and also work together with black's marked stones to develop the left side.]
;B[qq]MA[lp][lq][mq][mp][np][nq]LB[di:A]C[z -- perhaps the wrong idea for black.  This is big, but it makes white strong, which neutralizes black's strength in the center.  Black should attack at A, and later use his strength to invade in the marked area, while white is still thin.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[rn];B[po];W[qn];B[pr];W[or];B[qr]

(;W[oq]LB[nq:A][os:B]C[z -- White A would be better shape, and would make black's endgame play at B gote, rather than sente.]
;B[sp];W[dj]C[z -- good, white kept sente and found the important area.  Now it will be harder for black to get his money's worth from his central thickness.]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[fp]C[I had never seen this played before so I wasn't sure how to continue.  Looking back, I think c4 would be better.

z -- see next comment.];W[ep]LB[do:A]C[z -- Kogo's Joeski Dictionary gives this move or A as joseki.  I think your choice is fine.]
;B[eo];W[eq];B[go]LB[fo:A]C[z -- should be at A.]
(;W[do]LB[cn:A]C[z -- the proper play to move out on the left side is A.  This cut is dangerous, as black is strong in the center; but it does expose the mistake of black 91.]
;B[dn];W[co];B[cn];W[en]C[z -- this is why black 91 should be a solid connection.  The fight becomes playable for white now.]
;B[fo];W[em];B[bo];W[cp];B[ck];W[cm]LB[ik:C][ek:B][dk:A]C[z -- this move doesn't really work, as the game shows.  White A or B look better; if black responds underneath, white can start to think about cutting at C.]
;B[dm];W[dl];B[bn];W[cl];B[el];W[dk];B[fl];W[be]TR[bd][bn]LB[lp:A]
C[z -- the left side is undercut twice (marked stones), so white can't seal it off with one move.  Considering this, a play on the bottom might be bigger.  Especially so, since it looks like black can still invade there, perhaps with A.]
;B[fe];W[re]C[z -- good endgame play, but still a little too early I think.  The bottom is most important.]
;B[rd];W[sd];B[sc];W[se];B[rb]C[z -- black cooperates.];W[ff]
;B[gf];W[fg];B[gg];W[fh];B[fj];W[fi];B[ih];W[jn]C[z -- good, black 125 can and should be ignored.  This move finds the right area.]
;B[jg];W[kh];B[ae];W[af];B[ad];W[bg];B[ln]C[maybe trying to capture with l7 is better?

z -- that depends on the score.  So let's estimate:

Black:  top 45-50, bottom right 6, left center 6-8.  Total about 60.

White: left 20, right 10, bottom left 7 or so, upper center 3, captures 3, komi 6.  Total about 50.

So, white will lead if he can get 15 points or more from the bottom.  Defending will do this, so it looks OK.]

(;W[lp]LB[km:A]C[z -- trying to capture black with white A looks unreasonable anyway.  The variations show a few possibilities.]
;B[ml];W[nn]LB[mo:A][qj:B][hq:C][bp:D][bm:E]C[z -- why leave the gap at A?  For that matter, why play here at all?  White B, C, D, and E are all bigger.]
;B[mo];W[np];B[jm]C[z -- this is a mistake by black; it just forces white to reduce black's area.]
;W[in];B[im];W[hn];B[gm];W[gn];B[fn];W[gj]LB[gi:B][ej:A]C[z -- This is too small; the moves shown at 136 are bigger.  In addition, black could answer at A in sente, then cut at B, or just switch elsewhere.  Perhaps white could ignore black A, but there would be some damage.]
;B[gk];W[ej]C[z -- still too small.];B[fk]C[z -- too small.]
;W[gi]C[z -- too small.];B[no];W[oo];B[mp];W[mq];B[ol]C[z -- too small.]
;W[qj]C[z -- good];B[pk];W[qk];B[pm];W[ql];B[ko];W[jo]LB[iq:A]
C[z -- this is bad shape: a big empty triangle.  White should play at A instead, making territory while defending the cuts.]
;B[on];W[pn];B[om];W[km];B[kn];W[mn]C[I guess this was the game winning move.

z -- It's a nice capture.  But, I'm not so sure the game is won just yet.  Black made a few mistakes in the rest of the endgame.  8.5 points worth?  Maybe, maybe not, but it's hard to be sure.]
;B[lm];W[lo];B[mm]C[z -- really small!  This move is worth at most 3 points.  But perhaps black is rattled by his blunder at 167.]
;W[pj]LB[hq:A][bp:B][bm:C]C[z -- definitely not biggest.  A, B, and C are still bigger.]
