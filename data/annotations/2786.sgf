C[Hi reviewer!  I just started playing go about a month ago, and I'm
trying to improve as fast as possible.  In this game, I made an
effort to play for influence over the center, rather than nabbing
corners and territory on the sides.  I am white.  I believe that if I
had a better sense of how to count loosely held territory, i would
have fared much better in this game, for I wouldn't have made
certain risks that turned out to be stupid.  Please keep that in
mind when you're reviewing.

Thanks a lot!

Matthew,

I will be reviewing your game. I will preceed my comments with "DS:" OK?

A disclaimer:  I am only about 6k on KGS/ 3k on IGS.  My comments should help you see alternative moves, but certainly a stronger player may find my recommendations lacking!

David Swan];B[cd];W[pp];B[dq];W[pe]C[DS:  This is certainly playable, but you should realize what it means to play the 5-4 point.  This move plans to exert influence down the right side and toward the center while planning to give up the corner to B.]
;B[ec]
(;W[jp]C[DS:  I think this is ok, but  you should first play approach moves in the corners before taking big points like this, such as at  C5 or D5.  That said, I would have strongly considered playing at C10 first.  Letting B take that point is just too good when looking at the top left.]
;B[pk]C[DS:  Fourth line is difficult.  R9 better.  But it is in the spirit of what I said about W playing C10.]
;W[pi];B[pn];W[no]C[I'm going to try and box in the stones on the right side so that i
can gain thickness towards the center while they struggle for life.

DS: The normal move really is O4.  This too high and B can easily invade at R3 at his leasure. Also it doesn't seem to really attack B's Q6 group that much.]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo];W[rq];B[rp]C[DS: Bad move by B.  Avoid empty triangles. Anyway, this is endgame.  There are much bigger moves available.]
;W[nl]C[DS:  Although this puts some pressure on B, it is too loose. Also it really does nothing to help the stones below. A move at O10 might be better, as it extends from Q11 as well as attacks, preparing to create a moyo at the top.]
;B[om]C[DS: bad move.  Just helps W connect];W[nm];B[nn];W[mn]
;B[on]C[DS: another bad move.  Empty triangle again at Q7];W[oo]
C[DS:  Too small and too local thinking.  Expand your thinking of possible moves.  Try to find first Urgent moves that Must be played, then find Biggest move next. P5 is small and really not needed now. It is a single purpose move, ie territory, and has no effect on B.  Try to find moves that are multipurpose.  Such as with the proverb "Make territory while attacking" etc.]
;B[do]C[i am pretty happy with what i've done on the right side.  I'm not
sure if i could have been more aggressive or not


DS:  Actually, W let B live too easily on the left.  Also, the wall w got faces W's stones at D5, so is somewhat less useful now.  W seems cramped to me, while the upper R corner is wide open.  Now it looks like Q15 really should have been at Q16 instead. At this point the game is still pretty even.]
;W[jd]C[DS:  This is a big point, but I think a corner enclosure at Q17, or an invasion at C10 would be more urgent now.]
;B[qj]C[DS: This is small. Much bigger moves as noted before.]
;W[qi];B[pj]C[DS:  B really likes empty triangles.  He has wasted 3 moves here that could have been much better used elsewhere.]
;W[nj]C[DS:  Bad move.  Too small.  Again W really has no worries about the upper or lower groups.  So a connecting move like this is really unnecessary.  Better moves would be Q17 or C10.You may be thinking that this  begins to enclose the center, but with B's stones facing the center, this will be difficult.]
;B[gq]C[DS:  Too close to the D3 stones. C10 or Q17 at least.]
;W[ho]C[i'll allow black the bottom left corner, for the middle

DS:  good strategy, but wrong move.  With the C16 stones staring at the center/left, it will be hard for W to enclose the center.]
;B[go]C[DS:  Wrong direction.  Purely territory seeking, puts no pressure on W]
;W[hn]C[DS: Why?  I still think C10 or Q17 bigger.];B[gn];W[gl]
;B[hp]C[DS: Silly move. the pressure is in the middle.];W[ip]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ir]C[I am again pretty happy with this

DS:  Yes, but these still aren't the biggest moves on the board.]
;W[el]C[i feel that this move really expanded my claims a lot

DS: Good move. It looks like W is ahead by a lot now.];B[dl]
C[DS:  Both W and B play too many contact plays.  This tends just to help your opponent make a wall. In this case B is helping W enclose the center.]
;W[ek];B[em];W[gm];B[fm]
(;W[im]C[i was getting a little worried that i was too thin, so i decided to
put in the tigers eye

DS:  And just what did you think B could do?  W has played shapely moves that are thick and solid.]
;B[fl];W[fk];B[ff]C[DS:  I think D9 would be better first. Still, W has the upper R corner open.]
;W[gh];B[dk];W[hf]C[so far so good

DS: yes, and B is helping you too.];B[ei]C[DS:  B has secured his right side moyo. However, your strategy is working to enclose the center.  All W needs now is to secure the R corner and he has a won game. If B goes there, the game is a close one.]

(;W[eh]C[I think that this move was my first major blunder.  if I had
followed the variation shown, i think i may have been better off

DS:  I still think that Q17 or R17 is much more important now.]
;B[dh];W[fi];B[eg]
(;W[fh]C[would i have been better off going for the ko here, as in the
variation?

DS:  What are you worried about. F12 is very bad shape.  Even the ko is small here. B has more to lose than W.  See variation]

(;B[ej]C[DS:  Small small small];W[fj]C[DS: You are not looking at the big piture.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[ks];W[ls];B[js];W[lr]C[DS:  Endgame moves,  much bigger at the top right.]
;B[hd]
(;W[jc]C[instead of 68, should i have blocked the field, as in the
variation?

DS:  See variation.];B[ie]
(;W[ge]C[i feel that this was my worst mistake.  What was my best move
here?  was it the H15 variation?

DS:  I think K14 would work.  W will lose some, but remember your strategy, enclosure.]
;B[gf];W[he]C[DS:  You must give up unnecessary stones.];B[id]
;W[jf];B[je];W[ke];B[hg]
(;W[gg]C[DS: Bad move.];B[if];W[ig]C[DS:  Very bad move, this just opens up the double atari at K13]
;B[jg];W[ih];B[kf];W[le];B[lf]C[DS: At this point W has let B penetrate the center.  This is bad. Now W has a very difficult game.]
;W[me];B[fe]C[this is bad...i'm not happy about the encroaching stones, but i
can't see a way to stop them

DS: Not now. The only thing W could do would be to fall back all the way to L12 and try to enlcose the center. But with the corner still wide open, B has the advantage.]

(;W[gd]C[DS: Bad move, B has no worries.];B[gc];W[hh];B[fd]
C[DS:  Why save 4 stones, when the corner is worth 20?  However, see variations. I really don't see any realistic way for W to win now.]

(;W[hg]
(;B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[mf];B[mg];W[li]C[DS:  You both play local moves and contact plays.]
;B[mi]
(;W[og];B[oi];W[oh]C[DS: The defect at N10 is glaring. As is R17.]
;B[ri];W[rh];B[mj];W[lj];B[mk]
(;W[ml]C[DS: really bad move.  Two Empty triangles as well.]
;B[lk]C[how do you handle a creeping worm of death like this one?

DS:  Play away from it.  not in contact to it. ie K9 or K8.  W has no choice but to fall back.]
;W[kl]C[DS: Not good now.];B[ji]C[DS:  Empty triangle bit you..]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[kk];B[jh]C[DS: W in shambles.];W[rj];B[rk];W[si]
;B[sk];W[ni];B[oj];W[nh];B[mh];W[ll];B[ik];W[ic];B[hc]
(;W[dg]C[i figured this move wouldn't cost me anything, since black must
respond, so it was worth a shot, although i couldn't really forsee
a successful ending.

DS:  Not even a good ko threat!  Don't play hoping your opponent will make a mistake.  Try and play best move possible, not "Hopeful" moves.  R17 is still biggest.]
;B[df];W[cg];B[ch];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[bh];W[hb];B[hl]C[i didn't see this move coming, and i almost resigned, until i saw
the solution];W[hk]C[DS: Correct];B[il];W[hm];B[hj];W[gk];B[gb]
;W[ha];B[ga];W[ib];B[jl];W[jm];B[sj];W[ri]C[was this a good move, or should i have played elsewhere and
allowed a ko to start?


DS:  B clearly ahead, so what do you have to lose?  Anyway, the Upper R corner is still biggest.]

I think i was winning in the opening, but i blew it in the middle
game.  Please give me some advice as to how i can avoid such
ugly situations again in the future.

Could you give me a sense of how you think i rank, judging by
my gameplay?  I've been told i'm probably in the vicinity of 15
kyu.

Thanks again!

DS:

The Score I get is: (Terrirtory counting)
   W:
       territory 91
       Caps       2
       Komi     5.5
        Total     98.5

    B:
       Terrirtory 106
       Caps:      9
        Total        115

B wins by 16.5
 
B is ahead, but the upper right corner is clearly open but since W has sente, you should have played there to secure it..  You are learning but make too many local contact plays.  Remember the proverb "Don't touch what you want to attack" Contact plays strengthen your opponent. 

Watch stronger players, and review pro-pro games.  You (or I!) won't understand all their moves, but you will learn to see examples of good shape.  

Read some books on opening theory, But I think the best one for you now would be "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go"  You would advance your game well that way.  

I couldn't really estimate your rank. I have learned that rank/ ratings are very elusive things.  Often dependent on where you are playing and whether you are playing a quick light game, or a serious tournament game.  

Good luck!
