C[Thank you for reviewing my game.  I play white, and this game quickly becomes a large-scale battle along the left side, where I lose too many stones.  I'm still not really sure where I lost control of this game, so any suggestions of better moves I could have played would be really helpful.

--

W: My comments will be preceded with a 'W', like so.

This game was a difficult one to review. While some of the questions that you asked were strategic in nature, it was difficult to answer due to the complex situations in the game. In other words, most strategies led to complicated fights that required a lot of reading, and therefore, it is highly probable that I missed many obvious and non-obvious moves that could render my suggested strategies completely useless. As an alternative, I have suggested moves that would make the game simpler (and therefore more readable) rather than the 'best' move (since it's nearly impossible to determine at times). I tried my best, but I still expect there to be quite a few mistakes, so please keep that in mind when going through the review. My apologies for that.]

;B[bc]LB[de:A]C[I don't really like black b17

--

W: I agree that Black b17 is somewhat unusual. Black would normally look to seal White in with 'A' or something similar. That being said, I can't find a good way for White to respond here yet, so I think White tenuki-ing is a good idea. Even if Black later plays at 'A', he will have spent 4 entire moves in a single corner - not a great idea.]
(;W[fp]LB[do:A][ep:B]C[
W: Hard to say if this is a good move or not. Black can choose to play at 'A' and start the taisha, which is said to be the most difficult joseki there is. A simpler alternative would be White 'B'. See variation.]

W: I definitely think tenuki was a mistake. Letting Black get 'A' (D11) is a bit painful for White. This point also isn't urgent, althought it is quite big.]
(;B[cm]LB[bq:A]C[
W: I'm not so sure if this is a good move by Black. For one, this doesn't do much in way of attacking White. Black playing here induces White to play at C6, which later enables White to play 'A' (thus solidifying White) and also gives Black a weak group of his own to take care of.

[jl]C[i should probably just spend a move around here to protect my group on the left

--

W: I don't think so. White's left group can live in many ways. (see variations).

Apart from that, I think it's a bit difficult to say what White should do here. White can run out and attack the triangled stones, or play at 'A' and attack the squared ones. At first glance, I would tend to stick to 'A', since it both attacks the squared stones and helps White's center. However, it seems that White 'B' is much better for White in the game (see variations for next few moves).]
(;W[df]LB[ff:B][ki:A]C[

--

W: So, to summarize (as noted before, take this with a grain of salt):

-The opening was unusual, and seemed to be slightly more towards White's favour.

-White 28 was a mistake that left the left side unsettled, and was the catalyst for the ensuing complications. 

-A fight broke out in the center when Black tried to attack White's group. White's groups were split into the left group and the center group. Black made a mistake with move 53, but White failed to capitalize on it with move 60. 

-White 74 was another mistake that weakened White's center.

-White 92 was the biggest mistake in the game and turned the game solidly into Black's favour. White failed to connect his left side and ended up having the marked stones killed.

-White tried to turn the game around with 114, and was almost able to do it if it were not for the mistake in the capturing race with 162.

Judging from this game alone, it seems that you have a tendency to create complicated games. This is not a bad thing in itself, but it must be complemented by a strong reading ability. Therefore, I think the most obvious way to improve is by imprving your reading ability (i.e. do tsumego). In scenarios where the reading required is far too complex, I think it would benefit you to make the game simpler somehow (the exception to this would be when you are behind -- that's when you should strive to make the game complicated).]

;B[lk];W[lj];B[kk];W[hh]C[
W: Defending on a shape weakness like this (solid connection - not a bamboo joint) generally gives your group a lot more liberties. At this point, White's group has 6 liberties. Black's has 4. White wins the capturing race.]
