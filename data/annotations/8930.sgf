C[` My name is Kim and I'll be reviewing this game for David (black).  I begin all of my comments with ` to make them easy to identify.]

C[` Playing on the 5th line here seems a bit over ambitious, as though white is trying to claim the entire right side of the board.  My concern is that it leaves black plenty of room for a large, easy invasion.  I would prefer a stone on the 4th line here.  There will still be room for an invasion, of course, but white will be able to keep things tighter.]
;B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[co];B[dl]TR[cj]C[` Black lets white off easy here and turns that 5th line move at E10 that I said was too high into a good move.

If black had played a move like C10 (the triangle), we would be better able to see why E10 was too high.  Yes, that would allow white to cut off the initial invasion stone of E6.  But, black would have an excellent base from which to tear white appart to work with.]
;W[ck];B[fm];W[el]TR[hn]C[` This looks like a move that is trying to destroy black's eye space.  This isn't the time to be destroying eye space though.  Black still has lots of room to run, so even if you do deny him an eye, he'll be able to run and find one elsewhere.

It would be far better to just chase black for now.  Think about where you would like to have more stones, and use a chase as an excuse to put them there.  Personally, I really like the idea of a move around H6.  It splits white and gets you into the middle.]
;B[em];W[dk];B[fl];W[ek];B[gj];W[fk]C[` Pushing here is really slow.  If black was going to ignore this move, the follow up would be really nice.  But, there's no question that black's going to block here, so there's no point in pushing.  All pushing does is make black stronger.]
;B[gk];W[gi]C[` This move feels really awkward.  A single stone against two strong opponent stones like this is just asking to be pushed around later on.]
;B[hm];W[ee];B[fc];W[fd];B[bc];W[bd];B[jp];W[ip];B[jo];W[io]
;B[in];W[gn];B[gm];W[hn]C[Is it a big mistake for white to let black make a large teritory?

` What black is doing here isn't making teritory, yet.  There is still plenty of room for white to invade.  What I would call this is encouraging black to build up a big wall for influence.

That said, yes, pushing against black's stones here at this point in the game is a bad idea.  In fact, that goes for both this move and the two moves before it.  You're not increasing white's teritory by more than a few points, and you are making black stronger.  Save moves like these for end game, after more of the big stuff is settled.]
;B[jm];W[pm]C[` This is a good time to invade over here.];B[po]
;W[pj];B[oj];W[qj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[rk];B[qg];W[sh]LB[ok:A]
[qn:B]C[` Since pushing here is gote, I would not do it yet.  It would be better to push somewhere black has to respond first.  P9 (A) and R6 (B) would both be better options.]
;B[sg];W[si];B[ok];W[pk]C[` This move is slow.  If you needed this move to live, it would be fine.  But, you don't.  So, you should just focus on growing the group and getting out.  R6 followed by a move jumping out would make more sense.  You definitely don't want black playing R6 right now.]
;B[nm];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[rp];W[sn]C[` This is a bad way to protect the connection.  Right now, the group seems pretty safe.  But, you'll have to watch out for the threat of S7 later, and T7 could become a forcing move as it does later in the game.  So, it is better to just play a safe connecting move at S6.]
;B[rq];W[lq];B[mq];W[kp];B[ko];W[kq];B[mo];W[mr];B[nq];W[nr]
C[` This move is small.  It doesn't hurt you much since black responds.  But, it would be a good time to jump to another part of the board, like the middle which is huge right now.]
;B[or];W[ii]C[` Since G11 is awkwardly placed, it would be better to start pushing with a solid move like H11 rather than this 1-point jump.]
;B[le];W[kd];B[mg];W[ke]TR[ki]C[` This move is small.  It does little to stop black's advance in this direction, and it would be far more valuable to disrupt the large teritory black is trying to make closer to the center.  Perhaps something around L11 (the triangle) would be better.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[lf];W[jh];B[li];W[lh]C[` Instead of pushing here where black can block with ease, it would be better to push into a more open area where there is more teritory to be claimed.]

;B[fe]
(;W[ff]C[` This move is just asking for trouble by setting up a tempting atari for black.  A better idea would be to atari D16 first.  See variation.]
;B[de];W[ef];B[df]
(;W[dg]C[` Even at this point, atari would still work.  See variation.]
;B[dd];W[bf];B[fi]C[`  This is the sort of move that black was bound to make work eventually after you played G11.]
;W[fj];B[hi];W[gh];B[hh]
(;W[hg]C[` Don't forget that you can just atari at H10.  See variation.]
;B[hj];W[ih];B[hl];W[ij];B[ik];W[jj]C[` Saving a stone at this point is very small.  This would be a great time to go do something else.]
;B[jl];W[fh]
(;B[qc]C[Was it worth for white to invade the top right before or was the center more important?

` The answer to this really depends on whether or how an invassion in the corner would work.  As far as I can tell, an invasion in this corner would be pretty small.  So, while it would have been valuable to get to, I think several of the moves you made in the center were worth more.  At the very latest, you certainly could have gone for the corner at move 124.  See variation for my thoughts on the corner invation.]
;W[lb];B[mb];W[la];B[ma];W[jb];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[fb];B[ec]
;W[hc];B[eb];W[ib];B[fa];W[ha]C[` This move is really small right now.  It's only worth 2 points, and it's gote.]
;B[ga];W[ia];B[cg];W[ch];B[eg];W[dh];B[fg];W[gf];B[eh];W[gg]
C[` While this move works fine, I would rather see white capture at E11 here.  If there are two ways to solve a problem that seem equally good, I almost always choose to take stones off the board so they can't cause trouble later.]
;B[pl];W[ql];B[ol]C[What is white's best move?

` Locally? I think P6 is pretty good.

Globally? I think B7 is really big.];W[on];B[nn];W[oo];B[op]
;W[no]C[` White is better off not pushing here just yet.  There are far bigger moves on the board, and white is going to have to have to play defensively here when liberties get low (like after black's next move).]
;B[np];W[qp]C[` There's no harm in playing this move.  But, white is just delaying the need to defend.]
;B[pp]C[` Now white needs to defend to save all his stones.  Q6 would be good.]
;W[os]TR[mr][nr]SQ[mq][nq][or]C[` This is a bad move at any time.  Always watch out for situations like the triangled white stones surrounded by the squared black stones and avoid playing the hane at P1.  Once white connects his new stones, all of the stones end up in danger as we'll see later.

The fact that white really should have played Q6 instead makes it worse.]
;B[pn];W[qm];B[ps];W[ns]C[` I would connect at P7 here and save those three stones or at least connect at M2.]
;B[om];W[kg]C[` Play at M2 now while there's still a chance to save those stones!]

` C15 - That's the cleanest way to keep black from playing there.]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[so]C[` Connecting here now is what leads to the seki.  It would be better to just play S6.]

C[` Black wins by 12.5.

This was a pretty close game right up to the end - the perfect kind to review.

David, I believe the one thing that would help you the most is to try to eliminate small moves from your game.  Early on, these moves gave your opponent excuses to build useful influence, towards the middle and the end, you were just missing bigger opportunities elsewhere on the board.  I suggest playing your next few games resist the urge to automatically respond locally to each of your opponents' moves and stepping back to see if there's something bigger on the board to play.

The other mistakes I focused on seemed like reading mistakes (missing the seki and giving up the stones along the bottom of the board.  These are the sorts of things that I think you'll naturally miss less often as you play more.  Do try to keep an eye out for them, but don't worry too much if you still miss them from time to time.
