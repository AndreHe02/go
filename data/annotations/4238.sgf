It is maybe not the best corner move, because white would be happy to come at A, but that's a detail.]
;W[dp];B[jp];W[cf];B[pj];W[jd];B[fo]LB[od:B][cn:C][fp:A]C[-- 
This move looks a bit strange ; I think that A would be better because it puts more pressure on white. 

Looking at the whole board, I'd prefer the shimari at B which starts to build a nice moyo or maybe an approach at C to prevent white from making a big moyo.]
;W[od]LB[dn:A]C[-- 
Looks okay. A would be more careful.];B[dn];W[fq];B[ep];W[eq]

This is overplay. White isn't going to die...];W[cp];B[co];W[bp]
;B[bo]C[-- 
This is way too small ; it should be left for yose.];W[ck]LB[dj:A]
C[-- 
Good direction, but maybe a bit too close to black's strength. I think A would be better, because it also reduces black's influence on the center.]
;B[ap]C[-- 
It doesn't work.]
(;W[bq]LB[aq:A]C[-- 
Correct response, A doesn't work (see variation).];B[fj]LB[ci:A]
C[-- 
White has a weakness at A. I think it would be better to attack white's overextension by jumping directly at A. Here, black is helping white to correct his weakness in exchange for a moyo in the center ; it is usually not so good, because defending the center is hard.]
;W[di];B[ng]C[-- 
Same here. This move is too much center-oriented.];W[qf]C[-- 
Bad move ; it just begs black to separate white.];B[pe];W[fl]
LB[qf:A]C[-- 
It feels like white is giving up the A stone.
And it doesn't do much to enter the black moyo either...];B[el]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[qi]C[-- 
It will be difficult to live here...

And why does white play alternatively on the two areas ??];B[qj]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[pg];B[of];W[ne]LB[rh:A][ri:B]C[-- 
Wrong. I think white needs a move, otherwise black A or B will be very painful (and probably kill)]
;B[hq]C[-- 
A bit small.];W[jj]LB[jh:A]C[-- 
Nice. It kind of ridicules black's moyo. 
But this moyo isn't so big because there's still the invasion at the san-san (R3). So I'd say A would be more careful.]
;B[jg];W[lg];B[lh]
(;W[hh]C[-- 
Wrong ; it is almost always a very bad idea to change constantly one's plan. White should play some follow-up ; if linking isn't possible, white should try to make some shape (see variation).]

Sure.];W[hi];B[ij];W[fi];B[ej];W[qn]LB[nq:A]TR[qf][pg][pi][qi]
C[-- 
Correct, now it is time to invade black. But A is definitely better because 1/ there are less black stones there and 2/ it is very important not to weaken any more the white triangled group.]

A is probably better];W[mo];B[on];W[oq];B[pq];W[ko]LB[ln:B]
[ko:A]C[-- 
The idea is correct: there is no way to live on the bottom now, so white must get out.
But it is very difficult. 

A leaves some cutting point ; maybe B is better...];B[lp];W[lo]
;B[mp];W[np];B[op]LB[no:A]C[-- 
No ! Black *must* cut at A now, and then white dies.];W[nn]

I think white's main problem is that is doesn't follow-up his moves ; several times in the game, he played somewhere, then forgot about it and came back later, leaving black the opportunity to gain some decisive advantage...

For black, I think that trying to make a center moyo is possible, but just too hard ; playing corners-sides-center would help much.
