C[Hi, my name is Amar and i played black in this game.
Their was 0.5 komi and it was in chinese rules.
I probably would like advice on bigger moves since it was
a close game and really anything you find interesting.
I would appreciate it thanks :)

Alex: My impression is that you play a lot of "slow" moves in the opening, moves that don't put much pressure on the opponent.  I'll point those out as we go through the game.

By the way, there's something odd: in the game information with this file it says that black won by 12.5 points, but when I count the score myself I make it white by 1.5.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq]C[Alex: Now here, the normal thing would be for white to take the last empty corner, right?]
;W[qo]C[Alex: (S)he's trying to throw you off balance by doing something strange.  My first thought is to stick to general principles: the biggest move is still to take the empty corner.]

(;B[op]C[Alex: This is the first example of a slow move.  White should ignore this and play at D16, and you don't have a good way to attack the R5 stone.  If you don't want to play D16 yourself then you should try to take the initiative with something more aggressive, such as Q8.]
;W[rq]
(;B[lq]C[Alex: This is also slow.  You can extend as far as K3.]
;W[ql];B[dd];W[cf]
(;B[fc]C[Alex: I would prefer the high extension--F16 instead of F17--because it gives you a better follow-up after white plays P17.]
;W[dj]
(;B[fq]TR[lq][op][pq]C[Alex: Because your M3 group is already strong, playing at the bottom isn't urgent.  I would play P16 instead.]
;W[cn];B[ip];W[oc]
(;B[mc]TR[fc]C[Alex: Because the F17 stone is low, it's hard for you to develop a big territory at the top, so the pincer doesn't work so well.  I'm not sure what the best move is instead, but Q15 looks interesting.]
;W[oe]TR[ql][qo]C[Alex: Now there are a lot of complicated joseki that can happen from here, and I don't understand them very well!  I think the normal move for black is Q14, but with the strong white group at R8 it might not work out so well.]

(;B[qf]C[Alex: I think this is too slow, it's safe for you to go one space further (R13 instead of R14).]
;W[ld]
(;B[lc]C[should i have played this sequence differently?
I did get territory but turned out to be bad shape xD

-----

Alex: I think it's best to play Q17 first, to stop white sliding into the corner.  See the variation.]
;W[kd];B[kc];W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[hc];W[qb];B[og];W[rc]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake, white needs to play N16.  See the variation to move 33 coming up.]
;B[md];W[me]
(;B[qj]C[Alex: If you play O16 now, it looks like big trouble for white.]
;W[re];B[qe];W[rd];B[rf];W[nd];B[nf]C[Alex: Good move.];W[ne]
;B[lg]C[Alex: At this point I think you're winning.  White's stones at J16 through P15 look like wasted moves; there's lots of places you can invade on the left side if you need to, whereas all your groups look safe.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[dr]TR[ip][lq][op][og][nf][lg]C[Alex: Now I think you have a chance to do something good with the centre.  See variation to next move.]

(;B[bc];W[gd]
(;B[cg]C[was this invasion right place or any other place u find
right??

-----

Alex: I don't think you need to invade yet.  You have about 50 points of secure territory, and chance to make more in the centre; it will be hard for white to catch up.

If you do want to invade, C10 also looks interesting.  It's hard to say which is better.]
;W[df];B[bf];W[be];B[bh];W[af];B[bg];W[de]
(;B[eh]C[Alex: This looks too heavy to me, white can attack severely at B10 (see the variation to the next move).  I would play C9 instead.]

(;W[ff]
(;B[bj]C[Alex: C9 is still good.];W[cj]
(;B[ci]C[Alex: Too defensive.  B9 is better.];W[bk];B[ai];W[dh]
;B[di];W[gc];B[gb];W[ed];B[ec];W[jc];B[jb];W[dg]
(;B[ej]C[Alex: I prefer F11, it gets you closer to your "friendly" stones.]
;W[dl]
(;B[fr]C[Alex: This is another slow move.  If you want to play in this area of the board, E2 is the right shape, as it threatens to invade.  I still think Q6 is big, and R2 is also a good move here--white's group is starting to look weak.]
;W[qr];B[pr];W[fi];B[ei];W[hi];B[bl];W[cl];B[ak];W[ck];B[bm]
;W[bn];B[ag]C[Alex: You should save this move in case you need a ko threat later.]
;W[ch];B[fg];W[gf];B[ee];W[ef];B[fk];W[gp];B[hq];W[gl];B[gj]
C[Alex: This looks like an ugly shape, but I can't see anything better!  I want to play H9 instead, but I don't think it works.]
;W[gi];B[gk];W[hl];B[fl];W[fm];B[em];W[en]C[Alex: There's a nice tesuji here.  See the variation to the next move.]

(;B[gm];W[fn]
(;B[hk]C[Alex: J10 still works.];W[il];B[ik];W[jl];B[jj]C[Alex: Now that your group is definitely alive, this is a good time to count.  My impression is:

Black:
top: 18 points (white will play A17)
left side: 2 points
right side: about 15 points
bottom: about 25 points

total: about 60

White:
top (R18 through B16): about 15 points
bottom left: 20 (assuming G7 is captured)
right side: about 12 points
komi: 0.5
total: a bit under 50

so it looks to me like you're about 10 points ahead.

You should decide whether you agree with these numbers, then compare them to the score at the end of the game.]
