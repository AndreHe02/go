C[Hello reviewer!

I finally had a close game without too many obvious mistakes. Though of course there were some. (I've pointed some out during the game)

I recently reached 2k on KGS, so I think this game will do good for review.

I play white this game. and will type with "Y" in front

Thanks in advance!

Hi, Mathis!

This is Bernd from Gernany, HonFu in the GTL and in other go places.

Overall you played a solid game here, but I pointed out some thoughts and ideas about how you could have tried to achieve your goals in an easier way.]

(;W[qo]C[Y: I feel the distant approach would have been more appropriate here. This almost looks like kobayashi.

Hon: I agree.];B[po]
(;W[qp]C[Hon: I don't think this is good.];B[pp];W[qq]C[Hon: You are going for confinement voluntarily.]
;B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr]
(;B[nq]C[Hon: This does not seem like the best answer, but your sequence here eventually led to your trouble with reducing the moyo on the right side.

Better not get surrounded, rather make a free group on the side.]
;W[pn]
(;B[pm]C[Hon: Black should not strengthen you with an atari.]
;W[on];B[rn]C[Hon: Black has to come back ...];W[ro];B[ql];W[kp]
LB[np:A]C[Hon: ... and you can try to find a way exploiting black's weakness at A which you are going to do.]
;B[ko]LB[jo:B][no:C][jq:A]C[Hon: Black should have read ahead here (one-way street).

Hane looks too hard (pushing you towards his weakness), better play solidly at A or B and try to get time to defend around C.]

LB[hn:A]C[Y: I end up making sort of an exchange.. solidifying black and giving him great influence/thickness, however I do manage to break up his formation.

G6 was perhaps not the right move as trouble was found later.

Hon: You sold your five stones okay.

The proper shape would have been A.

But I can understand that you want to wall him in. I tend to do the same - follow a goal and overdoing it with the means to that goal by just a bit (and getting into trouble later).]
;B[jm]
(;W[qg]C[Y:
Felt like I couldn't just respond to k7 and let Black use his wall easily.

Hon: Good tenuki.

I approach distantly to make it harder for him to attack (Good/bad thinking?)

Hon: Black can attack you hard in both ways (see variation), but with this move you lose more of the corner.

Basically after getting surrounded in the lower right and suffering that huge wall down there, every invasion move in this area will leave you frustrated.]
(;B[qi]C[Hon: Wrong, attacking you from his strong side, leaving you an easy way to sabaki.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[rc];W[pc]LB[of:A]C[Y: Is this cut even useful? Wanted to gain some forcing moves to settle my group..

Hon: I am not good with this kind of fine technique - probes, well-timed forcing moves and so on. In many cases, though, if you want to play A, it is better to just play A, which threatens the cut all the same, but not solidifies black as much.]
;B[oc];W[pb];B[ob];W[of];B[nd];W[oe];B[od];W[pi]C[Y: Attaching here to try to make life easier for the group again.
Good/bad? Should I just run/try to make shape?

Hon: On stones that can not be harmed anyway (like R11), you are allowed to attach, because you don't lose anything. And attaching IS one and often the quickest way to make shape.]
;B[pj]
(;W[ph];B[ho]C[Y: The troublesome move by black which I mentioned earlier.

Hon: If you are ready to pay a bit more, it is not so troublesome.]
;W[hn];B[io]
(;W[gp]C[Y: Should perhaps go g5 and sacrifice j3, to avoid black gaining even more influence

Hon: Yes, I think so.];B[go];W[fo];B[fn];W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[in]

Hon: I like your follow-up in the variation though.];B[cj]
(;W[dk]C[Y: Or perhaps I should have followed up differently

Hon: This is the normal shape, but your move looks interesting.]

(;W[ij]C[Y: looks like it was too far

Hon: We tend to play too much by proverbs ("one-point jump is never bad") and neglect actual reading.

I will stop the review here. The rest is endgame, which both of us will still have to practice.

Until this point we saw a lot of our good old friends, the basic principles, at work - play away from strength, don't get surrounded, don't be afraid to pay a few stones, don't play a row of forcing (ajikeshi) moves if you can as well just play the last move in the row ...

But overall, at least from my perspective, you've played quite a good game. Try to go on like this! :-)]

(;W[jq]C[Hon: One way would be to exchange this once, then depending on how black answers, run out.

On the other hand, like that you would get a weak group, so there might be more merit after all in just throwing this group away, if you find a profitable way to do so (like in the game). Black has influence on the right side anyway.

Maybe both ways are okay.]))
