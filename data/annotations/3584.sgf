C[KKMD: Dear reviewer :
This is a real-life game, 1h+15/5, I have black. I'm mainly interested in knowing in which way what I perceive when playing the game or replaying it is right or wrong, so I'd like you to say whether my comments are pertinent or not. Of course, any other remark/analysis would be welcomed. Thank you !]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[ed];B[cd];W[jc]LB[df:A]C[White may be playing this move due to his preference, but actually this could be a trick play.  Watch out for this move when you play stronger players.  In that scenario, white is hoping black would tenuki and then play A to start the sequence.  Please see variation 1.]

(;B[ec]LB[dc:B][fc:A][fd:C][cf:D]C[KKMD: White's last move seemed strange to me. I played E17 seeing an obvious transposition, but wondering whether white could take advantage of this order of moves.

Your game move isn't appropriate.  Here's something you should be thinking when answering white's K17 move.  White extends to the side before settling the upper left corner.  How does he know he extends at the right distance?  You should think about making his extension inefficient.  Either make his extension too far, or make it too short (over-concentrated).

With the game move, the usual joseki calls for the A to D sequence.  In that case, the K17 stone is in perfect position.  Please see variation 2 for a joseki that makes the K17 stone inefficient.]
;W[fc];B[dc];W[qf]LB[nc:C][fd:A][cf:B]C[KKMD: This is the kind of move you usually don't see at our level. This one is an exception ; I know it is a standard probe with the joseki going on in the upper left ; but here, with the final stone at K17 already known, it misses the point, doesn't it ? So I try to make K17 a bad move.

You are right this white's move is seen more often in professional or high level amateur games.  Again, I don't know why white plays K17 in the first place: plan for the trick move or just exercise his own preference.  A better sequence for him is to play A to C.

You can make K17 a bad move as stated in an earlier variation.]
;B[nc];W[qc]C[KKMD: Again, I was surprised, but I can hardly tenuki.

This is premature for white, but you need to respond.];B[qd]
;W[pc]LB[rd:A]C[It's more common for white to play A.]
(;B[rc]LB[oc:B][od:A]TR[qf]C[KKMD: Not knowing any joseki in this position, I thought a long time then played this move, aware that it shouldn't be so good, but I just had to try, you know ? I think the other reason why I played this is because I coudn't decide between A and B. Could you give me common ideas in this situation ?

Key point: When white invades the corner, black gets compensation by building thickness.  In this case, your aim is to punish the white's marked stone with your thickness.  The game move (S17) puts a focus on terroritory, which is inappropriate in this situation.  Please see variation.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[rb];B[rd];W[nb];B[mb];W[oa];B[md]LB[mc:A][nd:B]
TR[jc]C[KKMD: I wasn't too thrilled to play this move, since it gives two forcing moves to white, but I see no other choice.

It's more common to play A, but in this situation white's marked stone makes the cut at B problematic.  So the game  move is fine.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[sb];B[fd]LB[ld:F][nd:B][ne:A][of:C][ng:D][pi:E]
TR[qf]C[This is not urgent.  Unfortunately black's upper right group is not in good shape.  The peep by white at A is annoying.  If black responds at B, then white can pull back at C and start a fight.  On the other hand, black can play a move around D to protect the cut, but this is too close to black's wall.  Either way is not perfect.  I suggest a move around E to limit extension for white's marked stone.  When white peeps at A, black can press at F for sente and fight.]
;W[gc];B[ee]LB[gd:B][fe:A]C[KKMD: Now I know that A is the joseki move, but by the time of the game I thought it would leave too much aji.

A is better, because the atari by white at B is just too good for him.  It's a tradeoff.  A has aji but it also builds stronger center influence and prevents white's atari at B.]
;W[gd];B[fe]LB[cf:B][cj:A][cn:C]C[KKMD: Too small, I guess I should have played around R9 ?

Not at all.  It's all about influence.  With the game move, black is very thick at the top left, and white can't play a move farther than A.  On the other hand, if white ponikues (not sure about spelling), he can extend as far as B.

Also with this thickness, when black approaches the lower left at C and if white pincers, black can use this thickness to punish the pincer stone.]
;W[pi]LB[ne:A]C[KKMD: I've had many problems with seemingly strong walls becoming a burden : you listen to the proverb, you push enemy stones against them, and suddenly you realize you are the one attacked.

Without the weakness at A, black should do fine.];B[qk]LB[nj:B]
[pk:A]C[I like A better, because it allows a follow up at B.]
;W[po];B[qp]LB[ok:A]C[It is more urgent to play the upper side.  Play A.  Either black takes the initiative, or white will be on the offense.]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[pk]LB[oo:A][np:B][nq:C]C[White should play A as in joseki, forcing black to respond at B.  If black skips B, white's move at C is very severe.]
;B[pl];W[ok];B[ol]LB[qi:B][qj:A]C[Force the black A, white B sequence prior to playing the game move.]
;W[ql];B[qm];W[rl]LB[qi:B][qj:A]TR[ql]C[With the A to B sequence, black can capture the two marked stones.]
;B[qn];W[qj];B[oo];W[pn]C[KKMD: It seems that white misread.]
;B[on];W[nl];B[om];W[ke]C[KKMD: Yep, as usual my wall seems to have become weak.]

;B[nk]C[KKMD: This was meant to set up the ladder at K11.];W[mk]
C[KKMD: But here I change my mind. I realize it must be horrible, but suddenly O10 didn't seem appealing at all.]
;B[fq];W[ji];B[nj];W[mj];B[ml];W[ni];B[nm];W[nf]C[KKMD: Hmm... All I can say is that neither me nor my opponent had read it all...]
;B[of];W[ne];B[ng];W[nh];B[mg];W[lh];B[rf]C[KKMD: ...because I thought this would give me an eye on the edge...

This is a common move to make an eye on the edge.];W[rg]C[KKMD: ...but hadn't foreseen this move...]
;B[sf]C[KKMD: ...nevertheless found this one, giving me the eye anyway, and obviously surprising white, so we were both ashamed of having played this sequence !]
;W[qe];B[re];W[jp];B[fo];W[en]LB[cn:B][dn:A]TR[jp]C[KKMD: What is that ?

White's move is bad.  A or B is more appropriate.  The game move forces a pushing match, and in doing so black builds a wall on the left and the marked stone looks more and more isolated.]
;B[fn]C[KKMD: I push white on the 5th line, hoping that he isn't building anything too serious.]

(;B[dj]LB[cj:B][ir:A]TR[iq]C[KKMD: That seemed to be the biggest point.

There is aji for the marked stone.  Play A.  It gets quite complicated.  I've put together several variations.

For the game move, I prefer B.  It is easier to form territory on the upper side.]
;W[dh];B[cm]C[KKMD: Play fast, lose fast. I missed white's answer. But what could I do ?]

;W[dq]LB[cp:A]TR[fn][fo][fp][fq]C[KKMD: An overplay by white ?

White should block at A.  With the game move, the built up thickness is useless because of black's marked stones.]

(;B[bm]LB[hs:A]C[KKMD: Aaaargh ! I should have played A ! I just forgot the connection.

Playing at A is better as it cuts off white's connection, but white still has to fight a ko to live.  Please see variation.]

[ps][qs][rs][ss]C[KKMD: Slightly disgusted not to have seen that white could connect this way, this is the last move I noted. I would say the score is about even by now, do you agree ?

Let's see. Black has 14 points the upper left, 8 points in the lower left, 8 points in the upper right, 21 points in the lower right, 6 to 8 points around L7, and 2 captured stones, yielding a total of 59 to 61 points.

White has 13 points on the lower side, 5 points on the right side, 5 points on the upper right, 10 points on the upper side, maybe about 5 points aournd L10, and 1captured stone, yielding a total of 39 points.

So, I believe black is leading by a large margin.  Besides, it's black turn to move, and a move around C13 yields quite a few more points.]
