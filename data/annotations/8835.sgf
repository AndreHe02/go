Hello, my nick on KGS is Betka (1d), so if you have any questions to the review, you can contact me there or write me a mail. I am 3k EGF. 

How to read the review:
All the comments in this sgf are mine, so I am not going to mark them with any special sign. The right order to read is first to find the commentary to the discussed move in the main line and then read the explaining variations from the top one to the bottom, since I try to order them logically. The summary is given at move 129.]

;B[ec];W[dd]C[Until now the fuseki looks rather normal, but his white move is a severe mistake ...]
;B[ed];W[ce]C[... because a double hane is perfect for you now (see variations)]
(;B[df];W[cf]LB[cg:A][dg:B]TR[cd][ee]C[Here, both black and white shape are bad because of the marked cutting points, so you should continue locally. Hane at the head of two stones at A is good here (after w protects, you protect too), if that is too hard to read then streching at B is also fine.]

[re][se][af][bf]C[White now played two times in a corner where you were first and two times got a big amount of territory and sente (I count him aproximatelly the marked 29 points by drawing a straight line to the edge where I dont know who will get to the important double-sente moves). He also has round 10 points in the bottom left corner and good potential on the bottom side. I is white turn.

Black has a moyo which will be converted to 30-40 points and maybe 5 points for his group on the left. 

White tricked you twice and is better off from the fuseki. The game is not lost yet, but it is necessary, that you trick him somewhere too :)]
;W[qg]
(;B[le]LB[ph:A]C[When playing on influence, you must be as ambitious as possible. W already got something like 30 solid points in both corners and some more on the bottom side. That means, that solidifying 35 points on the top side cannot be enough. Also a move in your own moyo showes that you are very focused on having territory in only one area of the board.

Here, a move at A is a must for several reasons.
1) w hane here makes a really huge difference on the right side (see var. starting with w playing A)
2) it enlarges your moyo (see var. starting b playing A)
3) not that important, but a good guide: it is shape]

[jg:5][lh:4]TR[dg][ph]SQ[np][op][mq][nq][mr][or][ns][os]C[Now the game is decided, most of the territories solidified, so I end my review here and give a summary.

From the third move (5-4 point) you started a game on influence. White tricked you with move 1 in the first corner  where you didnt see the double hane and a little also in with move 2 in the second corner, where he should not have taken sente. The triangle marks show places where you didn't finish the wall and the shape by extending and left white the possibility to hane over your two stones, although he didn't use it. Numbers 3, 4 and 5 mark slow moves which you played into your own moyo, unnecessary protecting and not expanding it. They also show that you were very focused on one territory on the top. When considering a move like 3, it is nearly always better to play in a completely different area of the board. With moves like 5 it is good to think about attack.
A major issue for the second half of the game was the weak group on the bottom, which really needed a jump into the centre. 

You can see that your loss is a problem of a few slow moves, two unpunnished overplayes and a weak group, so you can get a lot better by improving few things :) I think you should try counting solid territory which each side has even early in the game, in this way you can see how much you must get from your moyo. Also try not to have only one territory on the board, split opponents areas of influence earlier.]

(;B[ph]TR[eg][fg][gg][hg][ig][jg][kg][lh][mh][nh][oh]C[This is a very nice moyo. Lets look how to protect it in a good way.
I say that w cannot invade deeper then the marked line (the line between the edges of the moyo) without taking big risk. If he does reduce somewhere on the line, then you can still play the protective move you played in the game, or you have the option to attack.

A conclusion from the variations should be, that playing protective moves below the marked line is not good (if w cannot live easilly on the 3 line, cut you somewhere badly or something - not this case). Much better is playing elsewhere and using a w invasion for attack, or enlarging the moyo on the side - moving the marked line further into the centre.]
