AB[dp][dd][jj][pp][pd]C[I am only critisising and not praising in this review. :-)
Of course you played a lot of moves which are ok. But I think
a handicap game is a teaching game and shows very good the big mistakes.]
;W[fc];B[jc];W[cf];B[df];W[dg];B[ef];W[dc]C[In the following sequence white manages to connect his stones.
Blacks goal should be to seperate white. This is best done now
with a move at C15.];B[ed];W[ec]C[Last chance for C15.];B[gd]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[gc];B[hd];W[cd]C[This sequence was too mild on white. He gets a lot of territory.
Blacks influence is far from compensating this. Especially
because he has already a stone at K10.];B[eg]C[This and the following moves are a desaster for Black. They
are against two Proverbs:  Don't give your opponent territory at the fourth line.
Don't push from behind.

If Black wants to play on locally he has to cut at C13.
But I think its time to tenuki. Maybe a move at C6 would
be nice.];W[dh];B[eh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[fk];W[cn];B[co];W[dn]
;B[fp];W[hq];B[cq]C[This is far too submissive. A move like this I would expect
from a 10k, an 8k at most. Better is a pincer at K3 or a simple
move like G5.];W[fr];B[dr]C[Plants want to grow towards the light.
The light is outside. :-)];W[nq];B[pn]C[This is what white is hoping for. His two stones at F2 and H3
are not stable. White catches two flies with one stroke.
(Don't know if this is correct in english. :-) )
He gets an attack against the corner and support for his
two stones. Black should try to split the white stones.];W[pr]
;B[qq];W[kp]C[White already has 55 points of territory. So black has to get
50 points more than white from his framework. Not an easy goal
in a five stone game.];B[qj];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[qk]
;W[pi];B[ol]C[This black position is already strong. Black has to harras
the white stones. Better a move like O14. Threatening the
whote stones and in the meantime building up his framework.]
;W[mh];B[nf];W[og];B[kg]C[From now on nothing special is happening. Except that black is
mostly reacting and white is simply compressing the black
territory and expanding his own.   Black lost this game with moves like E13, E12, E11 and
C3 and D2. And he missed the opportunitys to seperate
white with moves like C15. It is very importand to  seperate white. The handicap stones are there to harras
white and get the initiative. They are NOT for making
territory.

If black recognizes this he will learn a lot from this game.
If he manages to play accordingly he soon not only will be
6k but will be able to play as 4k. :-)];W[kh];B[jh];W[lg];B[ki]
