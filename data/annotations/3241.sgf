C[Hi. Thanks for reviewing this game I lost as white.  I felt I was doing well in the early middle game.  I was chasing two black groups, but I wasn't able to profit from that and was behind going into the endgame.  Where did I go wrong?


I will do my best to find out :)
Sorry for my bad english.];B[pp];W[cp];B[pc];W[dd];B[qj];W[eq]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[db]C[I haven't encountered this move.  Was this a joseki mistake I sufficiently punished?

It seems strange to me too, but your answer was all right, I think.]
;W[cc];B[cb]LB[fd:a]C[this is the chance to enclose black with a (f16) black cannot resist, see var.]

(;W[bb];B[fe];W[df];B[jd];W[he];B[fg];W[jb];B[kc]LB[dh:a]C[Black should play a (d12)]
;W[kb]LB[mc:a]C[crawling on the second line at the begin of a game without cause is never good. If black for example answers n17 he has gained more influence than the 2 points territory white made with his move]
;B[lc];W[gb]LB[hg:a]C[much too small. better a,];B[dc]C[black shouldnt answer here but switch to another big move elsewhere. Even if white invests one more sente to catch the two d18 stones, this is small, because these stones are not important.]
;W[cd];B[ed]C[the same. this is to small. the three black stones are not worth a sente at this stage of the game.]
;W[fb]LB[hg:a]C[Oh, much much much to small. If you want to take care of this white group a is much better.]
;B[jf]LB[jp:a][dh:b]C[cause white lives now at the top, this move makes not so much sense as it looks like, I guess. a or b  look bigger for example.]
;W[hg];B[fi]LB[dh:a][eh:b]C[maybe a would have now been to risky for black (I dont know)  but b looks more active now than this move.]
;W[qe]LB[dh:a]C[Bad invasion?

I think so, because a move at a is more urgent to my opinion.]
;B[qg]
(;W[pd]C[why not r17? see one possible variation.];B[qc];W[oc]
LB[nd:a]C[better a. by the way: leaving this cut only makes sense, if you give up the p17 stone. that is not a bad idea, because the top is open, so that black must add a move in the endgame to make this territory sure. And you can use the p17 stone after the black cut to take care about your q16 stones.]
;B[od];W[nd]C[very bad I guess, see last comment.];B[oe];W[ne]
;B[pe]C[black should just extend. its a lot of territory.];W[of]

[lb:b][jh:c]C[black should first exchange a for b and then play something around c.]

(;W[mb]C[why. black couldnt link anyway.];B[og];W[nf]LB[jh:a]
C[still a would be better.];B[nh];W[mh];B[jh];W[hi];B[mi];W[ni]
;B[oh];W[li];B[mj];W[lh];B[lf]C[a wasted move.];W[kg]C[good.]

(;W[lg]C[this was not necessary. see var.];B[jj];W[lj];B[ik]
;W[mk]C[this atari is not so good. perhaps you could use the 011 stone in the future.]
;B[nj];W[nk];B[oj];W[kk]LB[dh:a][di:b]C[black has a lot of terrirory. if he now plays a or b, he is leading.]

;W[ok]LB[pk:a]C[not good. white gets nothing from this move while blck is happy to answer a]
;B[pk];W[nq]LB[ck:a]C[a seems bigger. if black playes here, his group is safe.]

;B[lo];W[jo];B[ci]LB[bj:a]C[very often its better for black to play a here, because now white can now get sente. see var.]

(;W[ch];B[bj];W[nn]C[risky. are you sure that the white group is alive? i am not, but i am not good in life and death problems.]
