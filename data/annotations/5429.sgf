(;W[no]C[sv];B[qn]C[After black closed his 'door', white left weakness at m3, if white add another move, it will be too slow. This is why white o5 should be played at m4 is white wants to defend.]

(;W[eq]C[There are two things I do not agree with this move. 1, There are many open areas, there is no need to hurry in. 2, white has already weakness at m3, it is not wise to make another weak group.  sv]

Making huge frame work;
Reducing frame work;

1, the right side is less interesting because black has r6 stone to limits white's development.
