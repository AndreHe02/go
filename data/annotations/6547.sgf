AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, I'm white in this game and I'vee lost by 0.5 point :)
It was played at DGS, so there is no time influence ;)
thanx for your advices how to play better.
I will try to put some remarks or question thru game to point out trouble points.

;W[fc]C[Q: Maybe I sould make base for D16?

A: C or D 14 are standard responses to this approach.  Either would be bigger than R15, because the Q16 group and S13 stone are both already close to settled.]
;B[qe];W[cf];B[fd];W[gc];B[ff];W[ci];B[cj];W[cd];B[de]C[You have good shape here, so your stones won't die, but white has taken almost the whole side and corner.  Something like C17 or C12 would probably have been better than F14.]
;W[ce];B[nq];W[gp];B[dq]C[This is quite timid.  It gives white's invasion a chance to spread.]
;W[dm];B[di];W[ch];B[gj]C[This anchors you, but gives white a chance to link his attacking groups D7 and G4.  At this stage of the game, one of the most important things to do is keep your opponent separated.  Several small groups are much weaker than a few large groups.]

;W[iq]C[Q: "thank you" move by white?

A: Yes, good trap at F7.];B[jq];W[fr];B[er];W[ir];B[pn]C[Q: I have many doubts according following sequence...

A: Yes, this move feels wrong somehow.  Maybe try Q2/Q3 or O5 first...?]

;W[qm];B[op];W[po];B[ql];W[rm];B[ok]C[This feels awkward for both players.]
;W[qj];B[pj];W[pi];B[qk];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj];B[sl];W[sm]C[Wasted move, I think.]
;B[oi];W[ph];B[im];W[jg];B[ji];W[lh];B[nf]C[Q: Would be better to defend in M10?

A: No, I don't think so.  This is the right kind of move because it threatens to cut white in several places, and white is still thin enough to have to react to that threat.  I'm not sure about the exact placement of this move.]
;W[qf]C[This is a very big move for white, because it settles his side group once and for all.  Up until now, a move at S12 could have reduced the group to a single-eye group, forcing it to run.]
;B[pf]C[This is not a bad move, but there are bigger moves elsewhere.  Around L17 or M11, for example.]

A: Yes, this was a good idea, but just a little too late.];W[ie]
;B[hg]C[This would have been better on the side somewhere.  Unless you have a solid wall to work from, it's too hard to make territory in the center of the board.]
