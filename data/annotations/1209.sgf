C[Hi, I appreciate the review.  I am mgt74, white, 24k* on igs, and my opponent is NR, although he claims about 15k. I lost, and think I deserved to, although there are some points where I would love to know what I should have done.  I have added some comments, questions, and variations of my own. I labeled all my comments "mgt74:"

I would especially appreciate feedback on the beginning. I have just finished a quick read through "In the Beginning", and while I feel I am beginning to understand the principles, I am still poor at putting them into practice.

Also, in this game, I believe after the opening, I play a pretty strong early midgame, expanding my poor end-of-fuseki-position. Then I lose my rhythm and fall apart. I'd appreciate any comments along those lines too. Of course all other comments are welcome.

Thanks,  greg];B[pc];W[pp]C[Merzuq:  Good day :)  I suppose I'll be your review-reviewer.  I will focus on the review, of course, but any points in the game I feel should have been noted I will point out as well.  Seeing as this is a variation-heavy game, I am going to do my best not to add any myself, but if it becomes neccesary, I will denote them with a *.]
;B[qe];W[dc]C[Steffan: Bear in mind that the diagonal fuseki is an aggressive one and usually leads to more fighting.

Merzuq: Indeed.  I'd play the same way though, seeing as if black plays in this corner, it's standard for white to play around k17, and I don't like to have to do that :)]
;B[cp]
(;W[jc]MA[ep]LB[ce:a][eq:b][ci:c]C[mgt74: Maybe better to take my own shimari at "a" or attack his around "b"? I was expecting him to play on a or b, leaving me open to play either one of the variations below... But, alas, he did neither...

Steffen: In my opinion this one is definitly played on the wrong side. `a` would look much better to me.
Playing on the buttom left I`d prefer to play on the marked spot (see variation).

In the beginning you lay the fundamentals of you further play.
There are (at least) two options for your strategy to choose from:

a) create territory. E.g. a shimari like black played in uppper right.

b) create influence (moyo or potential territory). I.e. large extensions like the one you played though this one is, I mentioned above, on the wrong side.
'c' would have been one of these.
It can be anticipated that black will invade around 'a'.

Merzuq:  I wouldn't say white's move here is ALL that bad.  If white now gets to enclose the top left, than this stone is on the vital point for both sides.  Also, if black were to play here, it is extremely urgent for white to play around r10 to prevent a black 'double wing formation'.  That being said, it seems approaching the bottom corner is more important.  However, 'c' I don't like at all, and I explain more about that in the variation it was given.]

(;B[cj]C[mgt74: this is where he really played, and I think my response was poor...

Steffan: You both seem to go for territory. Well at least the 3-line is said to be the line of territory ;-)]
;W[eq]C[Steffan: This one is really too close to black's sphere of influence on the left. You should keep farer away from it.

Merzuq:  I'd approach here, but from the 5-4 point.  It's best not to think of the left as a black 'sphere of influence'; it's only two stones.  if black get's to play here, though, it becomes a nice sphere of influence for him.  That's why the approach is important.]

(;B[dn]TR[cj]MA[hq][hp]C[mgt74: (Sorry about all the questions) Would a pincer around X have been a stronger response for black to make here? (previous variation).

Steffan: I already mentioned black`s sphere of influence. He would have made better use of it if he played one of these pincers.
( I added some to your variation. )

Merzuq: A pincer here would without a doubt be much better, but it's by NO means the end of the world.  It's to be expected.]
;W[hq]LB[hp:a]C[Steffen: 'a' seems to be better because it stands heigher if black invades at the bttom right.

Merzuq:  Either is fine, but this is more secure.];B[de];W[fd]
;B[fe];W[gd];B[qj]
(;W[qm]LB[mp:a]C[mgt74: slow on my part, but not sure what else to do...

Steffan: "Be more brave and try some fightin'" ;-)
(see variation)

It would also look good if you took the buttom by extending to the left of your corner stone.

Merzuq:  No, 'a' is not good.  No effect on black at all.  That would be way too slow.  I agree with your variation, though.]
;B[ph]MA[qe][qj]LB[lc:a][oj:b]C[mgt74: small??

Steffan: It very severly connects the marked stones so it's quite useful.  Black now could leave these stones alone.
(In the end you'll see that black based the territory created in this corner on top of this strength.)
Note:
The balance of territory at this point of the game seems to be almost equal (considering the leak of white's buttom).
I'll make another note when this changes.

Merzuq:  Well, I hate to say it again, but this is also very small, and has no effect on white.  better for black to give himself options than to try to secure one piece of territory.  Locally, 'a' is better, or 'b', if he wants to play on this side.]
;W[bd]TR[de][fe]C[Steffan: Somewhat a endgame move. Better do something for the connection of your buttom groups.

Merzuq:  Personally, I'd invade on the left here.  A play on the bottom would be too slow.  Note that the two marked stones are not very strong, or related very well to the c10 stone.  That is black's primary weakness, and it is time to exploit it.]
;B[bf];W[ge]C[Merzuq:  This is really just helping black.  The thickness white gains doesn't do anything.  Perhaps try capping at e10 instead.]
;B[ff];W[gf]C[merzuq:  Now black is much more secure, thanks to white.]
;B[lq]C[mgt74: Now this is what really hurts.

Steffan: I'd guess this was the turning point of the game. Now white's buttom is broken up in two parts and black will make some further damage here.

Merzuq:  You must expect black to play in here.  There is no doubt he will.  That is why it is so important to invade the left side.]
;W[nq]LB[pq:a][nc:b]C[Merzuq:  This move I always try to avoid.  It is almost meaningless in regards to the corner, and black's stone is still not under severe attack.  'a' is better locally, then black is almost guaranteed to try to secure his stone on the bottom, and you get to play the huge point of 'b' on the top, or reduce the left.  You must know, though, that white is going to HAVE to reduce the left to win.  The best way is still to cap of shoulder hit the c10 stone.]
;B[lo];W[io]C[merzuq:  This stone is not doing anything in particular.  It is an important thing to know that if they can't attack effectively, do something else.  They could find a good attack later.]
;B[qq]TR[qm][lo][lq]C[mgt74: What would be the best way to respond? Ideally, I would like to either a) kill his invaders or  b) make a wall facing my marked white stone to keep a little territor here, and/or c) separate blacks invaders from his marked stones so I can attack them..

Steffen: I try something in my variation below, but not sure if it would really work.
a) the corner stone is alive, I suppose. But the two marked stones are a bit in danger.
b) this would be VERY little territory. Don`t think about territory here, think about influence. And think about how you gain profit while threatening the invading stones.
c) separating is a good idea. Threaten to kill the corner stone while building up a strong wall and then attack the two marked stones would be an option here.
First, attack the corner stone to get strong yourself.
It is very important that you keep both invading groups separated.

Merzuq:  In general, this shows the mistake many people make with the 4-4 point.  you have three stones invested in protecting the corner, and nothing to show for it.  This shape, with extensions from both sides of the 4-4, is usually not very good.]
;W[qp];B[pq]
(;W[rq]C[Steffen: Don't try to kill him. Let him live small.
And don't touch his stones so closely. Stay a bit away from them like in the variation on P4.

merzuq:  Good point, Steffen.  The worst possible thing white can do is allow black to connect these two groups.]
;B[oq];W[op];B[rr]
(;W[rp]C[mgt74: I considered P2 as well (see idealized variation)]
;B[nr]TR[lo][lq]C[mgt74: I would have liked to have prevented this, to keep his marked stones  weak and unconnected...

Steffen: From the very beginning of black's corner-invasion you should have put everything into keeping black's invading stones separated and therefore weak.
I.e. you should have concentrated to the left of his invading stone in the corner.

Merzuq: Right on.];W[mp]LB[no:a][mc:b][nc:c][np:d]C[mgt74: poor play on my part... I think I should lave played something Higher, Like a (O5)... or even skipped up to B (N17)

I think 'b' would make more territory. But I am not sure if you have to play 'a' here first to prevent greater loss.

Merzuq:  'c' is the move for the top, 'b' is too lazy.  'd' is the best for the bottom, because it leaves nothing for black to atari, and thus the connection is gote for black.  And it leaves the peep to be played on the other side.]
;B[lp];W[mq]C[Steffen: Tenuki. Time for N17.

merzuq:  Still, the left side needs badly to be dealt with.]
;B[mr];W[mo]MA[mn][mq]C[Steffan: This one leaves a bad shape. Black could cut at the marked spot.
You better played elsewhere since you played N3.];B[mc];W[ke]
C[merzuq:  Slow and small.  Must attack.  Too far behind to win by making territory.]
;B[cr]LB[fg:a][mf:b][ln:c][ol:d][fn:e]MA[gg]TR[ke]CR[fj]SQ[ch]
[cl]C[mgt 74:  At this point, I am considering pushing in one of the following directions... On a 1-10 scale, I like   a) 10 my one fear was a cut at X later on, but i figured I could protect if necessary after the fight...
b) 7--but not great if he plays X first
c) 8
d) 5
e)  5 less important if I can play "a" first

Steffan: My 2 Cent on these:
a) is a nice move. As you mentioned it's a bit dangerous also.
A very good option.
(another option would be the circled spot. but this one is not as good.)

b) if you try to build up territory than this one is not a good move since it's "opening" too much.
And you reduce black's just a little bit. Well...

c) this one does not really have a purpose since it doesn't threaten black neither does it create territory.

d) small gain of territory.

e) dito


'a' seems to be the biggest move you mentioned.

Considering you're behind in the balance of territory you should now play more risky.  On the left side seems to be a bit of a chance to get an invasion going (perhaps squared spots). At least worth a try.
This in mind 'a' is perhaps a bit too conservative.

merzuq:  Well said.   Indeed, time for a deep invasion.];W[fg]
;B[eg]
(;W[ef]C[Steffan: This one is not so good.

Better keep extending.
( see variation )];B[ee];W[eh]MA[gg]C[mgt74I I was a little worried he would play at X, just because such fights are hard for me to predict, but this seemed great so far...]
;B[dg];W[gh]C[merzuq:  Better to play at f12.  No time to worry about the g13 cut.]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[ek]C[mgt74: I couldn't have asked for a better result, and a gote move from him...

You could have asked for many results much better :)]
(;W[fj]LB[gk:a][mf:b][lg:c][lh:d][ln:e]MA[kh][jh][ji]TR[mn]
[mo][mp][mq][nq]C[mgt74: ...but,  I stopped pushing here (bad me) and played a very submissive and slow move... At this point, I am still way behind, and need to do something stronger... maybe at one of the other points instead??
a) probably gote, but continuing my direction of attack (maybe he will respond by invasion around X to kill my potential moyo)?
b) attack while enlarging moyo a little?
c or d) to begin to solidify my moyo--i think too submissive though.
e) guard against his play at the triangle to attack my marked group, define the left border of my LR territory, and reach toward my LL group




(moyo is potential territory)

a) if I were black and you'd play there i'd probably cut.

So one to the left of 'a' seems better to me.

b) your territory will not get bigger by this. You keep black from building territory there hisself, though. But this is small and it's not a severe attack.

c, d) I like 'd' - if it's just to get some territory.

e) this is a good guarding move for the triangled stones, indeed.  And I like my "idealized" continuation ;-)  ( see variation )]
;B[fk];W[gk];B[gl];W[hk];B[hl];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]LB[jl:a]MA[lh]
C[mgt74: very bad on my part...  I was afraid if I played "a" he would play in place of my 61... probably not a real concern... I was overly worried about my new territory being invaded... now, My potential territory has shrunk, and he can attack my LL stones from his wall--he doesn't thankfully...

Steffen:  This "territory" you just created is very accessible from the right. Perhaps this move of yours should have been around the marked spot.
Your LL looks very lonely now.
And I wonder what would be the gain of playing 'a' except that black could cut?

Merzuq:  This move is actually not that bad.  It is good to extend like this;  strong, anyways.]
;B[jr]LB[jl:a][fl:b]TR[fk][ek]C[mgt74: I debated ignoring this and playing at a--threaten to connect and develop strength for possible cut at b... If I keep his marked group weak...


'a' would connect?
( see variation at next node. )

merzuq: 'a' threatens to connect, hence it would be sente.  I think that's what mgt74 means.  However, it is better here to leave the potential to run out to the center with this group, if need be.]

(;W[ir]C[mgt74: I know, just developing the strength of his stone.... adding little potential benefit for me...

merzuq:  This is good, trying to close off a base.  Don't forget to tell them when they've made a good move, Steffen, especially when they think it's bad :)  That's part of reviewing too.]
;B[me];W[lf]LB[lh:a][kh:b]C[mt74: too slow? again, strengthening him more than me.

Yes, I think this one is too slow. It doesn't hinder black from building up his territory but still leaves your own territory open for invasion. So 'a' or 'b' would have been a better choice.]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[mf];W[lg];B[jq];W[fo]C[I was actually building for the  cut i mentioned at F8 (which you will see later as I develop it). Maybe I should have saved this move however...

;B[ce];W[bc];B[ed];W[ec];B[mn]C[mgt74: pretty big point...

What if black played there? You had to play there! This was a good choice.

I think the marked stone still isn't big enough.
Better consider some endgame-moves like 'a' or 'b'.

merzuq:  This move is too slow considering the state of the game.  You're right steffen, white is too busy making gote moves like this.]

'b' will put some pressure on black's corner stone.

Your stones stand very high creating influence which would be your strength.]

(;B[eq];W[de]LB[cf:a]MA[jc]C[mgt74:  I felt this would give me the advantage on top, since the extension was already in place... weakening the advantage of his shimari on UR, while adding to mine on UL...

Steffan: I cannot overcome the impression that this extension is now too narrow to your corner-enclosure.
Perhaps you should go for more moyo and extend further down.
Extending to 'a' would be a good idea.
I personally feel uncomfortable with the marked stone.

Merzuq:  This extension is appropriate for this corner enclosure.  'a' I don't like to much because of the inherent weaknesses, and after b c10 it starts to feel thin.  still, white formation not worth two black shimaris.]

(;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[gp]LB[mq:a]C[Steffan: Now this one is weak for attack around 'a' but nice anyhow.

Merzuq:  This I don't mind for white at all.  You ought to continue these variations further, though.  Seeing as these reviews are for a much weaker player, they may not know where you are going with the situation. It's even possible they don't know the joseki!  If you're not sure what the best moves are, play out a variation you like and explain that there are many choices; this is just one.  I added a few more moves for effect.]
;B[cn];W[kq];B[jc];W[pj]C[White is certainly outpacing black in development, which is a good thing.]
)
(;W[ci]LB[de:a]C[Merzuq: This has no effect on black.  Black does not have to approach at 'a'.  If white plays at 'a', note that whites formation is nothing but a shimari and extension.  Look at these following plays:]
;B[fd];W[de];B[id]C[See, no real need for black to approach at d15.  This is not to be played yet, but is important to remember it is available against chinese-type fuseki.]
