AB[pd][dp]C[AKANE44111 [12k\]: hi
In a game of handicap go where I am given stones; what is more important establishing territory along the sides or securing corners?

====

Hi, my name is Simon, I'm roughly 6k on KGS and I'm going to be I'll be doing a review for your game. :)

As far as handicap games are converned, black mostly want to play with influence in mind with a focus on keeping whites stones separated and attacking them.

This is counter intuitive as white is the stronger player. If black plays moves which try to keep him intentionally safe then he may fall behind in terms of points. It is said that white's strongest advantage is black's fear of him.

White's aim is to slowly try to readjust the score of the game by creating outcomes which are locally and/or globally better for him. His main route to doing this will be by implimenting his superior fighting/reading skills.

However, at 2 handicap stones I wouldn't worry too much about this and just play a normal game. This sort of strategy is more relvant at 3+ stones where white has to be rather creative in order to get ahead.

At 2 handicap stones you'll even out the gap just by playing the game.]
;W[ce]C[loamysand [14k\]: Gg
What is the benefit of whites opening moving? It seems to be asking for an approach at c17, which I later d... I'm not sure that I see the benefit of such an opening move. Should I have approached in the corner sooner?

===

As I said before, white's advantage is his relatively higher experience in go. C15 is a move which focuses on outer influence instead of immediate territory.

What's more is that at your level you may or may not have the experience to handle this kind of move. Increasing the chance of black making a mistake is exactly what white wants to do.

As with any unbalanced corner, you don't need to approach it directly. If you so wish you are free to play Q4 or whatever move you want.

C17 isn't the move I would play straight away. I would much prefer D17.]

(;B[oq]C[Would moving to q4 be more beneficial? Or would it be better to pressure the white stone at c15?

====

You have nothing to pressure the c15 stone with at the moment so let's not get ahead of ourselves.

As with many things in the opening, there isn't a clear answer as to which of Q4 or P3 is better. The answer is that you should play as you wish. P3 suggests and influencial strategy, which is fine.]

(;W[id];B[ip]TR[oq]C[In hindsight I feel that the stones on the bottom seem unbalanced and seem to call for an attack on the right side by white.

====

This formation is a little novel, but in terms of theory it seems alright to me.

There is a 5 space extansion between the marked stones which is ideal, all the stones are based on influence.

There is a 4 space extension between D4 and J4 but once agan, in the opening I cant say with certainity that this is bad.]
;W[pk];B[ck]C[Would have been better to address whites last move at q9?

====

Meh, not really. Whatever you want.

Personally I think that if you want to play a side extension, C10 is probably better due to having a 5 space extension.]
;W[qp]
(;B[pp]C[Perhaps r2 instead? or is it better to play elsewhere on the board?

====

You can play elsewhere if you want but I thinkit would be simplest to reply.

I've never seen Q4 before but I don't think its a terrible move. Depends on what black does with it.

The simplest move is the variation which I have shown before at the start of this review]
;W[qq]C[S.

This is not good for white, you should lock him into the corner.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[pn]C[Im not sure what I am trying to accomplish by pressing on the right side other then minimizing whites territory. I find it difficult at the beginning of the game on figuring out how to properly take sente.

====

Stop worrying so much. So far you're doing fine.

Pressing like this is A okay since your wall is facing a friendly stone.]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[ql];B[lm]C[I was trying to establish territoy and great influence over the center with m7

====

Personally I think M7 is a bit slow. There is a proverb "don't make territory with thickness".

The point of your wall is not to make points directly from it by surrounding territory like you have.

The point is to say "hey, I am planning to surround all these points!" and have white invade.

Since you are so thick, you can push white around and make point somewhere else.

This is real go strategy.];W[ko]C[This is exactly what I am talking about]

White just entered your sphere of influence

Attack.

If you want to attack, don't touch the stone!

Touching the stone makes it easier for the opponent to settle.

(;W[dh]TR[cc][go]C[S.

Let me explain the idea of sente quickly.

A move is sente if black's next move is the largest move on the board such that if he plays anywhere else white's next move will be able to compensate for the most spent elsewhere with a little extra.

You exchanged white's move for yours. White can now connect and is no longer in trouble. (Maybe.)

Here you respond to this move, which is a little a little small. Let's consider how big this move is.

If you look at the variations, each way causes each person to lose 3 points

It's sente for black so its worth double (6 points)

Since the move is reverse sente for white it is also worth double (I believe) So let's say it is also worth six points.

Right, can you find a bigger move?]

Considering that you lost by the ammount of moves you wasted I would say that it might be a good idea to do propper reading in order to tell if you need to play an extra move to be "safe".

Ive seen lots of peole lose with play like this. Safe isnt safe if you lose because of it.

Consider now where white made points and where you lost points.

Ive highlighted 4 areas.

1. These stones could have lived without a problem but due to connection issues they died.

2. Black could have connected, reducing whites space & allowing him to spend moves other than ones focused on settling

3. You took sente at a bad time and white connected. He could have made far less points if you would have isolated him

4. It looks like instead of black having influence in this area first, white did and black invaded. However, the opposite is true. The invasion could have been handled better.]
