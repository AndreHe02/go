C[Jared: Hello!  I'll be reviewing this game for Brian (white).  My comments will be marked with "J:"  I will focus mainly on two ideas: "shape" and "sente."

Shape is a fundamental concept to keep in mind in all parts of the game (fuseki, joseki, even fighting).  Shape is what gives your stones strength so you can fight to your fullest later in the game.

Sente (or "tempo") is used in a couple different ways.  As a noun, it is basically synonymous with "initiative."  We say something like "Black has sente (because he didn't need to respond to white's last move)."  Another way we use it is as an adjective "That move was sente because if white doesn't respond, the corner will die."]
;B[do]C[Ivan13 [12k\]: hi
Ivan13 [12k\]: good game
Redux [12k\]: hello a gl
Redux [12k\]: and*];W[pd];B[pp];W[dc];B[jq]C[J: Strange opening for black.  D5 appears to want influence along the left side, but K3 wants territory at the bottom.  A good response for white would be C15 and then invade at the next opportunity at D3 or so.]
(;W[qn];B[mp]C[J: This is a bit of a greedy move by black, intending to scare white into playing like it was the usual 4-4 joseki with N4 at O3.  White should invade the corner immediately. (See variation).]
(;W[rp];B[rq]
(;W[qo]C[J: This move is too submissive, see variation.];B[qp]
;W[so];B[sq];W[pj]LB[ce:A][dq:B]C[J: This is a big point, but I think A or B is bigger.]
;B[dj]C[J: This is white's last opportunity to invade.  If W C15, B D3, W K17, black's moyo will be bigger because of white's defensiveness on the bottom right.]
;W[ce];B[dq]TR[cl][cm][fq][gq][hq]C[J: This sequence ends up a little strange for black.  D10 is now too high (should be placed at C10), so there is potential for a white invasion at C7.  Also, the D3 to K3 extension is fairly wide, so there is potential for invasion there as well.]
;W[jc]TR[dc]C[J:  This creates a flat shape at the top.   K17 should be placed at K16.]
;B[qh]C[J: Here is where white's mistakes start.  Black is playing inside of white's sphere of influence, so white should have a good shot at making life hard for black, but white plays much too submissively and allows black to gouge out a huge portion of white's potential territory.]
(;W[qf];B[qj]
(;W[pk]C[J: I think this is white's first BIG mistake.  This move is much too faint-hearted!  See variation.]
;B[qk]C[Ivan13 [12k\]: sorry, i had some internet connection provlem
Ivan13 [12k\]: problem

J: After this, black's group gets twice, then three times as strong, and it's hard for white to put any pressure on black at all.]

;W[pn];B[pi];W[oi];B[pg];W[oh];B[pf]
(;W[pe]C[J: I think this is another mistake.   R15 is sente, and accomplishes the same thing.]
;B[qe];W[qd];B[re];W[rf];B[rg];W[rd];B[qg];W[se];B[nf]
(;W[ne];B[lf];W[le]C[J: This is ok... but I would prefer to play a bit farther away as white and take territory.  Remember, contacting an enemy stone makes it stronger.]
;B[nh]C[J: these next few moves are strange by both black and white.  Black is playing as though his group is not alive (it is), and white is playing as though black is attacking (he's not).]
(;W[ni];B[mh];W[lj];B[ki];W[kj];B[mi];W[mj];B[og]C[J: This is not sente.  White is strong enough to let black cut.]
(;W[nk];B[li]C[J: This is one of black's slowest moves so far!  White should take the chance and invade!]
(;W[mn]C[J: But this is a slow move as well.  It accomplishes basically nothing.  Trying to surround territory in the center this early isn't a great idea.  (See variations for other, more active ideas).]
;B[ke]
(;W[kd]TR[le][ne]C[J: The sequence up to 66 occurs twice in this game, and it leaves white with bad shape and gote (opposite of sente).  This is a consequence of playing too close with the triangle stones.

Situation as it is, L16 would be better placed at M16];B[me]
;W[md];B[ld];W[lc]LB[nd:A]TR[fj][jo]C[J: The reason this is bad shape is that black can either start a ko with A , or simply tenuki (for example at K5 or F10), and the game would get very unfavorable for white.]
;B[le]C[Ivan13 [12k\]: sorry..  i am in a hotel and the internet really sucks her
Ivan13 [12k\]: here

J: ...but black is nice and connects.]

;W[fc];B[jj];W[ji]C[J: I think this cut is unreasonable.  The stone won't live on its own, and you can't connect to anything.  It makes black's territory bigger in the middle.]

;B[ep];W[fo];B[fp];W[go];B[gp];W[hp];B[hq];W[jp];B[ip]C[J: Here's that shape again that I mentioned.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[hn]C[J: At this point, black should take the big point at C13, and the game would be over.]
(;B[hp];W[jn];B[kq];W[kp];B[lp];W[lo]C[J: This is not sente.  Black should play C13 and win the game.]
;B[lr]C[J: Black misses his opportunity, and white gets the big point.]
;W[ch]C[J: This is good, and it makes the game a little closer.  I think black is still ahead by 10 points or so.]

[cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os]C[J: So you might notice that most of my comments are in the first 60 moves of the game.  The opening and initial approach moves are SO important because they set the stage for fighting later.  If you have bad shape at the beginning, it will haunt you for the rest of the game.  Keep the idea of sente in mind.  Get in the habit of asking yourself after your opponent's moves "Do I need to respond to this?  What will happen if I don't?"]

The moral of that story: don't count on your opponent's mistakes.  Even though black lost bottom right corner, the right endgame moves can recover the game.]

This is a good game for white since black is open on the left side, and K3 is low (3rd line), where K16 is high (4th line).  Fighting will favor white in the middle.]
