GC[Comments by Arno Hollosi (dada)]AN[dada];B[pc]C[dada (4k on NNGS): I'm going to comment on B's moves only, as I've no business commenting moves of a 3dan player.]
;W[pp];B[nq]C[dada: Unusual :)];W[kp];B[no];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[pe]LB[kr:a]C[dada: This move is premature.
It's better to play at 'a' (l2) instead, to stabilze to bottom group (see variation).]
;W[ec]
(;B[dd]LB[cc:a][cd:b][de:c]C[dada: Doubtful move.

Approaching the W 5/3 stone is usually done by playing 'a' (c17), 'b' (c16) or 'c' (d15).

'a' and 'b' may lead to complicated variations. You should play at 'c', if you want to avoid complications (see variation).]
;W[dc];B[cf]LB[cd:a]C[dada: Bad move.

Playing at 'a' (c16) is better.];W[cd]C[dada: W takes the vital point...]
;B[de]C[dada: .. and B gets bad shape.

The result in the upper left corner is very good for W.];W[ch];B[cp];W[eq]
;B[cj]TR[cf][de][dd]C[dada: This move is an overplay.

Your group at d15 (marked) is too weak.];W[eh];B[dg];W[dh];B[fd];W[be];B
[ce]TR[cj]LB[bg:a][bh:b]C[dada: I don't like this move. It doesn't prevent a white connection.

It's better to play at 'a' (b13) instead. This leaves B with the option of connecting to the marked stone by playing 'b' (b12) later.]
;W[bd];B[fc]LB[ff:a]C[dada: Doubtful move.

I guess it's better to play at 'a' (f14) instead.];W[ed];B[ee];W[fe]C[dada: Ouch.]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[jc];W[fb];B[fg];W[cm];B[ej]TR[eh][dh][ch]LB[bg:a]C[dada: this is not good.

B is just creating another weak group.
B should try to strengthen her weak groups first (lower left corner and upper left side).

Note that the three stones at d12 (marked) are strong as W can connect them to the upper left corner by playing at 'a' (b13) anytime he wants. Furthermore the B f14 group is weak, thus even if B cuts the connection W will have no problems securing this stones.]
;W[fh]C[dada: W starts a splitting (double pronged) attack.];B[hg];W[gh]

(;B[gg]LB[hf:a][he:b]C[dada: Bad move!

A bamboo joint at 'a' (h14) is almost always better than this move.

Here B has another option: the nose tesuji at 'b' (h15) (see variation).]
;W[id];B[jd];W[ie];B[jg];W[dk];B[hh]LB[ig:a][qj:b][kr:c][dq:d]C[dada: This move protects the cut at 'a' (j13), but it's too slow to play it now.

Several other big (or urgent) moves come to mind: 'b' (r10) expanding the upper side moyo, 'c' (l2) to strengthen the bottom group or 'd' (d3) to strengthen the lower left corner.]
;W[qg];B[md]C[dada: This move is too passive.];W[kf];B[pj]C[dada: This is an overplay.

B has too many weak groups to look after and can't afford to start a fight like this one.]
;W[og];B[nj];W[qd];B[pd];W[re];B[mg]LB[hj:a]C[dada: This move doesn't achieve much - consider playing at 'a' (h10) instead.]
;W[qc];B[hq]C[dada: Kamikazee !!

B is too weak to start an invasion like this. The lower left corner and her bottom group are too weak. If these two groups would be stronger, this would be a good invasion.]
;W[do]C[dada: first W shuts B in ...];B[dp];W[ep];B[co];W[dn];B[dq]C[dada: bad shape]
;W[er];B[cr];W[bn];B[bo]LB[bq:a]C[dada: This move leaves a lot of bad aji in the corner. I guess it's better to play at 'a' (b3) immediatly and make the corner unconditionally alive.]
;W[lq]C[dada: ... then W starts an ideal splitting attack.

There's no way for B to get out of this with a good result.];B[ho];W[kn]
;B[nm];W[mn];B[nn];W[hm]TR[hq][ho]C[dada: The marked black stones are captured.]
;B[jq]C[dada: as the followup shows, B can't live here.

It's better to force from the outside (around j8 area), threatening to rescue the two black stones. If W defends, B builds influence towards the center and may even get territory there.

By trying to live inside (and failing) B robs herself of this chance.];W

;B[hi];W[fi];B[gj];W[fj]C[dada: W captures the black group - the game is over.]
;B[ij]C[dada: This move is small.

Playing at the right side is much more important.];W[pl];B[ok];W[mk]C[
  OneEye 12k*: i know i should resign now <g> you mind if i play on a
bit to see how i can do on the rest?

  OneEye 12k*: well, my names not oneeye for nothing '-)];B[mm]LB[ol:a]
[qr:b][qo:c]C[dada: Doubtful move.

This doesn't protect the cut at 'a' (p8). Playing at 'b' (r2) instead feels good, as B could aim at 'c' (r5) later, threatening the W group on the left.]

[je];W[qr]C[dada: W gets the big point.];B[oq]C[dada: defending against the cut (p8) is urgent!

W could capture the whole bottom group, if he would play there now.];W[ki]
;B[mp];W[lp];B[kh];W[lh];B[lg];W[ol];B[mo];W[ln];B[op];W[kg]LB[mr:a]C[dada: W could kill the black bottom group by playing at 'a' (n2).]
;B[jh];W[qi];B[mh];W[qj];B[li];W[kj];B[mr];W[lr];B[po]LB[pk:a]C[dada: small gote move.

Connecting at 'a' (q9) would be sente.];W[qo];B[oo];W[pq];B[os];W[bf];B
[ph];W[pg];B[pi];W[qh];B[ib];W[hb];B[ja];W[nf];B[ng];W[oe];B[pf]C[dada: A "thank you move". B forces W to connect, where W would have to connect eventually.]

  OneEye 12k*: oh okie :-D];B[kl]C[
  don 3d : oh yeah :)];N[Conclusion]C[dada: B made several mistakes in this game. Even if her g6 group would be alive, W would win by at least 50 points.

B made the same mistake several times: instead of defending her weak stones, she created new weak groups. W had plenty of targets to attack.

As seen in the game, attacking doesn't necessarily mean killing a group. The purpose of attacking is to chase the enemy group and build influence or take profit.

Defencive moves are very important. If you defend your stones, the can't be attacked - they become strong. From a position of strength one can fight or make invasions.

Have a look at the game again and see how W defends his stones, makes them strong and then attacks relentlessly.]
