C[Hello GTL Reviewer,



This is one of my recent games, played on KGS.



Black : styxx (12k)

White : truesaint (12k)

Komi is 6.5

Canadian Time Settings.

15 Minutes main time. 10 minutes per 25 moves.





I'll be writing up my thoughts and questions as i remembered it. Please feel free to correct anything that seems wrong. Thank you very much in advance.

s: Thank you for allowing me to review your game.  I play as samtregar on KGS as 7kyu.  If you have any questions please feel free to email me at sam@tregar.com.  Also, please remember that I'm only 7kyu, so many things I say will be wrong!]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pe];B[jp];W[oc]LB[pc:A][qc:B]C[I'm experimenting with new ideas of corner enclosures. This is actually the first time I'm doing this particular sequence. Maybe this is not a good idea since black's sanrensei is kinda scary...:)

s: This looks interesting to me, although I don't know how to evaluate it.  The usual enclosure would be at A, which I've seen frequently.  This is closer to your stone at D16 and doesn't fully enclose the corner.  I think this moves aims to take territory on the top side and perhaps benefit (somehow) from a fight around the corner when black invades at B.]
;B[dj]C[Four star points.

s: A very common openning.  Black is all on the fourth line so he must be going for influence.  Stones on the fourth line are too high to make territory, so Black must plan to take a lot of the center.]
;W[pj]LB[cn:E][qn:F][cq:D][fq:C][iq:I][jq:H][kq:G][nq:B][qq:A]
TR[jd]C[I only have two real options here.

1. To expand moyo, trying to match black's big moyo.

2. To invade somehow.



So far my particular weakness is that i don't know how to do invasion or reduction properly, so i really don't have any idea on how #2 should work.



So I'm trying option #1.  Q10 looks better than K16, so i took that one instead.



On retrospect, if black took K16, White is in deep trouble.

s: I think you are confused about the meaning of black's stones.  His stones are too high to enclose territory - you can invade almost anywhere on the third line and make life!  I'll mark a few places.  In short black does not have a moyo yet, so you don't have to worry about building one yourself to balance it!  Now is certainly the time to invade.]
;B[jj]C[s: black really wants the center.  You'll have to either take it from him in battle or make enough on the sides and corners to counter it.]
;W[jd]C[At this point white's position looks a bit bad to me...

Black seems to be very big... and an invasion is bound to happen soon.

s: this is a very submissive move.  You're overconcentrated along the top while black is nice and spread out.  You are playing black's game.

s: On the other hand, this is a big point no matter how you cut it.  Taking this point can't really be counted as a bad move.]
;B[cf]LB[gc:C][ce:A][ch:B]C[These are the moves that I considered....



A is attachment, not sure how good it is.

B is pincer, but I'm worried about D10.

C is defensive. Will probably lose corner after the exchange.

s: A very common move from black.  I think B is probably the best option.  A should be reserved for times when you have the stone around D10.]
;W[ce]C[Took A with fingers crossed.];B[df]C[s: black is playing by the book.]
;W[gc]TR[cg][bh][ch][bi][ci][bj][cj]SQ[aa][ba][ca][da][ea][fa]
[ga][ha][ia][ja][na][oa][pa][ab][bb][cb][db][eb][fb][gb][hb]
[ib][jb][nb][ob][pb][ac][bc][cc][dc][jc][ad][bd]C[Although white is securing some territory, i can't help feeling that white is behind A LOT at this position.... Any comments are welcome.

s: white is way ahead in secure territory.  Black has almost no secure territory at this point.  However, black is killing you in influence, and if he's smart he'll be able to use that to attack you and gain profit.  I've marked your (mostly) secure territory and black's (mostly) secure territory to give you an idea of what I'm thinking.]
;B[jf]C[s: This is a big move.  Black is using his influence to reduce your potential.]
;W[me]LB[cn:D][fq:C][iq:E][kq:B][nq:A]SQ[ja][ka][la][ma][na]
[oa][jb][kb][lb][mb][nb][ob][jc][kc][lc][mc][nc][ld][md][nd]
C[Again, this is only 'land-grabbing'.

s: it's a pretty big grab, at around 20 points, but I think it's still too small for so early in the game.  You must invade if you want to win.]
;B[ng];W[pg]LB[lg:A]C[Again.

s: terrible move.  You seem determined to give black everything he asks for.  A would be a good start, aiming to separate this stone from the others.  Or ignore it and invade the lower side which is probably better.]
;B[nj];W[qn]LB[kq:B][nq:A]C[First time invasion

s: this is hardly an invasion.  It's meerly an approach from your strength to a weak black stone.  You're actually helping black build up his territory by playing this way!  I would prefer A or B.  If it's too late for them then it's probably too late to win!]
;B[pn];W[pm]LB[qq:A];B[on];W[qo];B[qp];W[ql];B[nq]C[s: Now black finally starts taking some territory.  This sequence worked very well for him.]
;W[fq]LB[cn:A]TR[on][pn][qp][nq]C[Last chance for another invasion.

Actually i was thinking about A, but i don't like the results of the right side, so this one (F3) is closer should there's need to run to the right side...



Wrong thinking ?

s: This is a good move, but it would have been much better before the marked stones got into place.  Now you're in for a tough fight.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[iq]C[Up to here, this is basically the same sequence with the ones on the right side.

s: black lets you off easy, but he can afford to, he's doing very well for himself.]
;B[jq];W[ip]LB[ir:A]C[The block is a must, no ?

s: I think so.  Either that or A.  I'm not strong enough to know which is better.]
;B[cn]TR[go][io][jo]C[I don't know what black is doing with C6. Is it important ? Pressing with J5 looks more severe to me.



I was starting to realize that the game is starting to look like a handicap game...:)

s: This is a slow move, but it's not wasted.  It aims to secure nearly the entire left side for black.  J5 looks good too, I agree.]
;W[gf]LB[eh:A][ei:B]C[At this point i have sente, so I was asking myself, do white need to peek out of J4, since black didn't see this part as 'important'.

s: This is a decent reduction, but black will secure more territory fighting it off.  I think I would favor something deeper like A or B]
;B[fg]LB[gg:A][hg:B][gh:D][hh:C]C[Now i should say that i'm not good with invasion/reduction. i don't know what to do with this position.

s: I think A has the most promise.  It lets black secure the left side, but you press into the center which is where the final showdown will be.]

(;W[hg];B[gi];W[jo]LB[jh:A]C[Chance to muddle things up a bit down there.

s: muddle is right... what happened to the reduction at the top!  I'd try A next which has the potential to both attack black and possibly win you some territory.]
;B[io];W[jn]LB[ho:A]C[s: this looks doomed.  A might be a good way to squeeze into the center.]
;B[ho];W[go]C[s: dangerous play...];B[gn]
(;W[fn]C[This is a very stupid move...:)

I was thinking about how to kill the two black stones on H5 that looks surrounded...:)

s: yup];B[gq];W[hp]C[Up to here, white still didn't see the danger...:)]
;B[ir];W[om]C[Tenuki.

s: this move is, I believe, called "pushing from behind".  You're basically pushing black along the line he wants to play...]
;B[mn];W[nn];B[no];W[nm];B[po];W[mm];B[ln];W[lm];B[kn];W[km]
;B[ko]LB[jm:A]C[I don't understand this move, though...

Securing territory ?

s: Yes, I think so.  Perhaps black sees that he's ahead and doesn't want to risk making the cut at A for a couple stones profit.]
;W[jl];B[rp]C[s: very small];W[ro]LB[bf:B][jh:A]C[s: I think you tenuki here.  There are bigger moves available around A.  Even if you want an endhave move, B is bigger.]
;B[ih]C[s: Good move.];W[jg];B[ig];W[kh];B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[gg]
;B[gh];W[kf];B[ie];W[hd];B[id];W[ic];B[bf];W[hh]C[I vaguely saw a kill ... here, but not sure about it.



I thought the push on the upper left is only worth around four stones.

s: If black ignores you I think you can kill.  But it's easy for him to escape.  So this is sente, but not much more.]

(;B[hi];W[hl]C[The idea is if black protects the cut at J11, white will push deeper inside around E8, destroying some territory, hopefully worth the slip up on the upper left corner...



I was torn between doing this and the cut at J11, since i was not sure it would kill...

s: This isn't bad, but I don't think it's worth as much as B14 is too black.  He can use B14 to take away your whole corner, which should be around 15 points.  You'll be able to take away around 10 points with E8.  It's not a good trade.]
;B[gm]C[s: Ah, but you got lucky, he didn't see it!];W[ii]C[This is the killing sequence.

s: indeed.];B[jh];W[ji];B[kg];W[je]C[This is rather funny, actually. I was just reading up on the 'crane's nest tesuji' on Sensei's Library. And someone said "well, i've never pulled something like that in a real game".



This is not really the same thing, but i think it's close...:)]
;B[ij];W[ki];B[kj];W[lj];B[li];W[lh]
(;B[mi]LB[lk:A]C[s: yuck.  Obviously black has to play A if he wants any chance to pull his stone out!]
;W[lk];B[ac]LB[cc:A]C[I completely forgot about the upper left... the last several moves was trying to prevent black to live on the right.

s: I think black could also play A with possibly even more devastating results.]
;W[bc];B[ad];W[bd];B[ae];W[gl]C[Looking back, i think this is the wrong thing to do...



Will G9 be better ?

White is not looking for territory, just wanting to destroy black's.



I was also looking at the possible cut at H10.

s: H10 does look interesting here.];B[fl]
(;W[fk];B[fj];W[gk]C[The thinking at this point is,

"if black protects the cut at H10, white will push inside and wreak havoc".



Didn't really work as well as i expected...];B[hj];W[ek];B[dk]
;W[el];B[fm];W[en];B[do]LB[dl:D][em:A][dn:C][eo:B]C[Lots of options.



A is about saving E6 and F6.

B is forcing move.

C, um..., i forgot why i thought it was good...:)

D is pushing further, but will definitely get blocked at C8.]
;W[em];B[dl]CR[hn]C[Now white's options are limited...



Marked point looks like a double atari, if not for the dead white stones...:(

s: I make this mistake too.  I keep forgetting which of my groups are dead so I waste lots of time thinking about how I can use dead stones.  So let's both try to stop doing that.  ;)]
;W[ff];B[eg];W[ej]C[The reason for this is that i thought i saw some sequence that will allow a cut at F12...]
;B[ei]C[Didn't work...:)];W[dm];B[cm];W[ef];B[bb]C[Ouch.

s: Indeed.];W[cb];B[ca];W[db];B[qc]LB[oc:A][pe:B]C[Here comes the part i dread....:(

s: This is the obvious result of playing A.  Most go players "know" that A and B don't enclose the corner even if they're not exactly sure how to attack them.]
;W[qd];B[rc]LB[pb:A]C[s: I think A might work better than this but I'm definitely not strong enough to be sure.  Certainly it looks like a hard struggle for black with so much white around.]
;W[rd];B[pb];W[ob];B[rb]LB[qa:A]C[s: This doesn't look right to me...  I think you can kill at A.  I don't see how black can escape after that.]

(;W[sc]C[s: this also kills, I think.]
(;B[sb];W[qa]C[I think this is a kill, but not sure....

s: Looks like a kill to me.];B[im];W[il];B[jm];W[hm];B[hq];W[in]
C[Consolation prize! :)];B[pd]C[s: yuck.];W[pc];B[od];W[nd]
C[Small ladder...];B[oe];W[of];B[de];W[ee];B[ed]C[s: Looks like you're not the only one that forgets about life and death.  I think black was imagining killing G14.]
;W[ec];B[fd];W[fc];B[nc]LB[nb:A][ne:B]C[s: ignore this.  It has no possibility of living.  If black A, white B.]
;W[nb]C[I wonder if this is the right direction of play....

s: It hardly matters.  Black is 100% dead and just wasting time.]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[ph];W[qh];B[og];W[ne]LB[da:B][sp:A]C[One less problem to think about... wonder if that's the correct thinking at this position...

s: I don't think you needed to play that.  I think you can ignore blacks last play and get some end-game points around A or B.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[oj];W[pk];B[mk]C[Frantically trying to get the second eye....]
;W[ml];B[kk];W[lg]C[One less problem again.];B[kl];W[ll];B[cc]

I can't help feeling that i got lucky with the outcome. The fuseki is especially bad. Any suggestions are welcome. many thanks in advance.

s: You are correct that black played a much better fuseki.  After he killed you in the lower left I thought the game was over.  But you came back in the middle game and caught a couple lucky breaks.  In the endgame black was clearly confused and you took virtually all the big points.

s: I've read that to win at go you must have courage. I think you would do well to think about that.  Many times you wrote about being afraid and feeling scared of black's power.  You must find a way to defeat that fear and dive in head-first.  Otherwise bold players will push you around in fuseki while their power is largely an illusion.

s: Thank you for allowing me to perform this review.  I'm sorry it was so late!]
