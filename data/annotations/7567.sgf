C[-was move 17 an effective invasion of white's position in the lower left?
-move 67 i made the decision to try and stake out territory in the center instead of trying to save the two stones at Q7 Q8, it worked out but was this because it was a good strategy or white not playing effective moves?
-at move 129 i was unsure of how to best extend my center shape, and in the end this stone let me move far into what could have been white's territory. was it a good move or was white's lack of response what allowed me to extend so far?
-from 195: would there have been a way to get two eyes in this small of an area?
-could white have made territory in the upper right corner?]

C[vlkplk: It is difficult to think about good invasion into white territory. I think that F3 was not a bad move. But jumping just between opponents stones invites problems.]
(;B[fq];W[eq]C[vlkplk: This is strongest and also very common reply from white. It deproves black from entering the corner.]

(;B[bl]C[vlkplk: Although big move, I would prefere to continue fight as in variation. Pushing from one side makes naturaly opponent stronger on the other side.]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[el];B[ek];W[fn]C[vlkplk: With this move white attempts to enclose black group. Than it would become useless for any other fight which would come on later. So, black cannot wait now and get out somehow. Notice, that white also covered his cutting point at E5, which black can no longer utilise.]
(;B[qf]C[vlkplk: Contact moves are generally not considered good for attack. It induces strong response and makes opponents stones even stronger.]
