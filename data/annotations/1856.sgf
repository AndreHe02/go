RE[W+37.50]

C[this game is a good example of me thinking I'm winning when I'm actually getting slaughtered !
VCR: Hi David. I know perfectly what you feel. I think this kind of feeling will never end.
So my comments are not focussed on how to feel better but how to play better.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[dp];W[dd];B[jp];W[fq];B[eq];W[gp];B[dn];W[gn]

(;B[hq]TR[hq][jp]MA[lq][mp][np]C[VCR: Here, David, your move is not correct. You will lose the hand and your situation will not better.
This is due to the fact that your two stones are not able to take care about themselves if white is going somewhere around X.
The variation is standard.];W[fr];B[er];W[cl]C[I didn't like the thought of completely ignoring this to playK6, but maybe?

VCR: Well there is a big difference in playing K6 as in the previous variation and now.
If you play it now look at the variation]
(;B[dl]C[VCR: So I think keeping White seperated is good.];W[cm]
;B[dm];W[ck]
(;B[cn]C[VCR: I think the way to keep on attacking is to play outside as in the variation.
The problem is that you move does not threat anything on the three white stones.
So you are only taking points. That is not the most urgent thing to do right now.]
;W[gl];B[jn]CR[cn][hq]TR[gl]C[VCR: As white invest one more stone in the center with the maked stone, it is becoming difficult to do anything against his group.
Your move gote again. So the three moves I am highlighting are dubious.
White started with an attacking move on the wrong side. From this point you could expect to have a good game. But after having played these moves
your situation is not improving. Finally white spend a full gote move the marked stone to restore his situation. He still has two weak groups but I think his
situation is not so bad.];W[kq]C[I thought this move was rash of white, but as you will see, failed to punish him satisfactorily!

VCR: maybe the desire to punish your opponent is not the best way to be driven  You can be quite happy he is putting stones in this area as it will be another target for you.]

(;B[di]C[VCR: isn't the variation 1 the standard move ?];W[dj]
;B[ej];W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[dg];W[cg]C[VCR: I think these black stones are not forming a wall that can be used for attack. There are cutting points in it.
I think the result of the previous variation is better than this figure.]

(;B[jl]C[VCR: The next variation is a way to play your move in a sequence.]

(;B[pj]TR[cf][df]C[would I have had more fun keeping up the pressure in the centre?

VCR: You played these marqued stones to make your wall stronger but it kills any opportunity in the corner.
You have the hand to keep on attacking the white group but no good point is available.
You are right to go somewhere else.
Your move is nice and flexible.];W[lo]
(;B[lm]C[VCR: You are attacking from your strong side. I give you an alternative move.]
;W[pn]C[again, this looked like an overplay - how many weak groups does white want? - but why can't I do the appropriate damage to them?

VCR: I think your stone is not so well either. That is quite fair play.]

(;B[oo]C[VCR: Diagonal play is not the move here. The result you get is not good.]
;W[on];B[no];W[nn];B[mn];W[mo];B[oq]LB[or:D][po:C][pr:B][rp:A]
C[is this the correct shape here?

VCR: I think that A or B are giving white peeps. So they should be rejected.
I could see black playing C.  But lets not talk about it as a shape move. My last try would have been D.]
;W[po];B[qp];W[np];B[op];W[nq]
(;B[lr]C[Before diving into variations. Let us recall rules in life and death :
1/ Reduce eye shape and then strike at vital point. This move is not following this advice.
2/ Do not try to kill if you are not sure of your sequence. By playing a failed sequence you are only achieving to things :
a- securing life for your opponent of course !
b- removing potential forcing move in the area theatening that group.
3/ By not killing a potential dead group, your are not making it alive ! That is your opponent move that makes it alive.
So you still get two moves elsewhere. If there are good they can be as huge as the killing of a group of this size.]
;W[kr];B[jr];W[ks];B[lq];W[lp];B[or];W[mr]
(;B[nm]C[OK - I thought I'd at least get these, but no...
VCR the fact that the white stones are now alive makes it harder to fight against these ones too.
Your Move is taking this into account but you did not realize that the capture was not so big then.]
;W[ol];B[nj];W[ml];B[mm];W[nl];B[lj]C[VCR: Good move, your are becoming thick outside.]
;W[pk];B[qj]C[VCR: all your moves are OK];W[ll]
(;B[km]C[VCR: you should have played the variation.
Now your situation will break apart. The game will become though for you.]
;W[kk]
(;B[jk]C[here I thought I'd let him out so I could push and build up strength to come back to the original weak group.
VCR: I think the idea is now that either you let you cut and then you will have two heavy weak groups or you fight to stay connected.
Making plan the left white group is not reasonnable when you have two disconnected groups without eyes.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[ki];B[ji];W[hh];B[jg];W[lh];B[hf]C[VCR: the game show it is difficult to kill this group but you played the only move.]

(;B[gs]C[VCR: if you do not kill, this stone is pointless. It is better to try a stone that can help in any case see variation]
;W[iq];B[ip];W[hp];B[fs]C[that was unnecessary, wasn't it?
VCR: I think it is setting up a way to connect your central group to the corner. So it makes your position stronger.
Of course, it does not kill white.];W[in];B[im];W[hm]
(;B[ho]C[VCR: the other move is also limiting the number of eye in this area without giving a stone to white]
;W[hn];B[fo];W[go];B[hk];W[fn];B[eo];W[fm];B[qg]LB[hs:A]C[in retrospect, should I have a connected at p10 b tenukied?
VCR: this move is OK in terms of taking something on the right side.
Of course, as the central group is still not alive, the hootest spot is to make it safe.
As White can cut you at A, it is difficult to play strongly on this corner if you need to take care of the threat white A.
Then you look how white is dealing with this corner and trying to take something out of it.]
;W[oj];B[kd]C[thought I could attack stones around here - rather missed my own shortage of liberties!

;W[gb];B[fb];W[ib];B[kb];W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[ee];W[eb]C[oops - just made white stronger and lost my aji against the top left corner?
VCR: No problem, better to try something on the right than to invade left corner.]
;B[qc]C[this is where it all began to go wrong - would s15 be better, or should I be doing something around o17?
VCR: Ouch ! Not groups everywhere. Better to make central group stronger.
Of course, it does not win the game. So, go for the max ! :-o]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[od];B[oc];W[qk];B[rd]C[this really hurts my side group, doesn't it?
