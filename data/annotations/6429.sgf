C[Hello! I'm very happy that you like to review my game. I 
(1k) was playing white against an 1k.
Please point out my mistakes. I'm especially interested in 
fuseki and direction of play.

Hello, I hope my comments will be helpful to you!];B[pc];W[qp]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[nq];W[pe]C[Since O3 did not put that much pressure on R4, i decided 
to tenuki.];B[qe]C[Should white simply play R14 here?
They are actually pretty similar outcomes; in one white 
gives more of the corner, but gives black a better shape.
However, R14 might be slightly easier to manipulate.  See 
the variations as to why.]

;W[qf];B[od];W[oe];B[ne];W[of];B[md];W[pg]C[I like the result locally, but black has sente now.]
;B[ql]LB[om:C][op:A][pq:B]C[This move seems nice. What should white do now? I 
thought tenuki might be bad now, so white has to play 
something in the corner.
My ideas are A or B. Since i'm not familiar with the joseki 
variations after A, i played B. Is B the correct move, or is 
there a better way for white?
Can white dare to attack more with a move around C?
B is decent, but A is most likely honte.
Though C at first glance seems pretty good, it is actually a 
poor move.  It places very little pressure on black's stone 
and can easily be isolated.]
(;W[pq];B[no]C[Now the corner is mostly enclosed and R8 became quite 
strong. I decided to split black immediately.
A very good idea.  I would do the same.];W[on];B[ol];W[nn];B[qi]
;W[pk];B[pl]
(;W[mo]C[I like this result for white. Now black has two weak groups 
and the thickness in the upper right is useful.
Is this hane the correct move?

It is a very good move, but I think I see a tesuji here; see 
the variation.];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq];W[kp]LB[mn:A][lo:B]C[This might be a little to critical, but here is a point that 
most kyu level amateurs play; it is good, but it leaves a 
weakness at A and B (A in this case).
It is acceptable in some cases, but here it doesn't work, 
so white should have played at A instead of at the marked 
stone, since the resulting variations would be similar.]
(;B[kq];W[jp];B[jq];W[ip];B[iq]
(;W[fc]LB[cj:A][hp:B]C[Is this move the wrong direction? Is A better for white? Or 
is B mandatory?
A is better for white.  You've probably heard never to let 
your opponent form a double wing.  Black playing A would 
let him.
B is a lot bigger than it looks.  If black gets to play 
there before you do (provided you don't approach his 
bottom-right stone, it's very big).  If he ignored it, you could 
cap his group and attack both his group and his stone in 
the corner, like in the variation.];B[cj];W[hp];B[gq]
(;W[cq]LB[cp:A][bp:B]C[I thought it might be a good time to invade now. Is there a 
better spot to invade? Maybe A instead?
A seems worse than the situation that occurred here. 
Ithink instead B would work pretty well];B[cp];W[dq]C[Is this the correct shape for white?]
;B[ep];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[dr]LB[ds:A]C[This move better at A?
I don't like the result here. Is there a way to live in sente?
A and this move are equal; this might be a tad, tad 
better in case a ko occurs here, then black has one less 
local threat.
I don't think there's a way to live in sente.];B[cf];W[bd];B[hc]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[fk]LB[ek:A]C[A better?
This move seems better than A, a cap would be less 
effective (for black) now.];B[ek];W[el];B[ej];W[fm];B[ef];W[ge]
LB[hd:A][id:B][gd:C][ic:D][ie:E]C[Is this the correct shape?
The variation white A, black B, white C, black D, white E 
is better.];B[he];W[hf];B[ml];W[hd];B[mn];W[lo];B[ic];W[ie]
C[I think the ponnuki is very good for white. Now the 
influence of N16 is not very useful, and white has perfect 
access to the center area.
Exactly! Good insight!];B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[kd];B[kc];W[dg]
;B[df];W[fh];B[eh]
(;W[fg]LB[fj:A]C[I think this move is bad for white. White should tenuki 
instead, right?
How about white A?];B[gj]
(;W[eg]LB[cg:A]C[Is this move good for black? After black fixes at A, white 
lost the possibility to play A herself.];B[cg];W[nk]C[I played here because i thought this stone will help later 
for a white move at R9.];B[nl];W[fj]C[I played here to give white a way to connect.]
;B[kl]C[What should white answer now?];W[qk]C[I misread the following tsumego. R9 is probably a very bad 
move.

Well, it's not so much the initial move as the few important 
moves you missed.];B[ok];W[pi];B[rk]LB[pj:A][rj:B]C[A is better; if black doesn't play B, white can.]
;W[rj];B[qj];W[pj];B[ri];W[rl];B[sj];W[rm];B[qn];W[rn];B[rg]
LB[qh:A][rh:B][oo:C]C[Playing A here is better, since  this move cannot 
connnect to the marked stone with just one more move.
Black has to play B, and white can then play C to cause 
trouble for black.];W[rf];B[ph];W[oh];B[qh];W[oi]C[Black lives in sente. This cannot be good for white :(]
;B[oo];W[po];B[pn];W[op];B[np];W[ld]C[I played here for time reasons.]
;B[lc];W[ch]C[This is probably a bad move, because it just helps black.]
;B[bh];W[ei];B[cl];W[bn];B[co];W[ao];B[bm]
(;W[kj]C[I do not like this move. White cannot expect much center 
territory because of O15 and L8. Is there a better way for 
white?

Well, I think going for that territory is suicide (literally in this 
case :(   

Instead, how about this?];B[lj];W[li];B[kk];W[mj]C[I played here because i thought that capturing the N6 
stone makes black half-dead, so that white can play 
sente moves to make solid territory in the center.
This actually happend, but the H4 stones became too 
weak in the process.];B[jj];W[lk];B[jm];W[lm];B[ll];W[mm];B[ik]
;W[ji];B[ii];W[ih];B[hi];W[mf]LB[lf:A]C[This is the result i hoped for. But i do not like this white 
move because
1) it is probably better to play at A
2) H4 is going to die :-(];B[le];W[ke];B[me];W[lf]C[Solid points, but white is dying :(]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[hn]C[I did not expect this move. I was surprised and i was 
going to resign soon.];W[fo];B[gp];W[ho];B[kn]LB[go:A]C[I think black could have killed easily with A.

Yeah, you got off lucky];W[go]C[I was relieved here.];B[ln]
;W[or];B[nr];W[ci];B[bi];W[dl];B[ck];W[hq];B[hr];W[am]C[I counted me behind for some reason, so i was going to 
start a ko. There was not much time to think (byo yomi), 
so i messed up terribly.

If you count, you realize here you were actually up 15+ 
moku.];B[al];W[cm];B[an];W[fp]LB[ap:A]C[This is probably the worst threat i ever played.

lol; ive played worse :)];B[cn];W[fq];B[gr]C[The game ended here, black won by time.
Thank you again for reviewing this game!

It was fun, so I don't mind at all.

Your play is very well tempered and sound.  The only 
think you might want to improve on iis finding tesujis.  If 
you would want to, I suggest going to goproblems.com 
and working through graduallly harder tesuji problems.  
They really help with analyzation.])
(;W[lk];B[mk];W[ik]C[Now white can get at least some of the center and H4 
lives :)

C[Still good for white, A is still a threat.]))
(;W[oo]C[I think this move is very big for white. It secures the P6 
stones, it threatens to connect the lower white group and 
it makes the P8 stones weaker.
It is, but playing it now is premature, since black's group 
would be alive regardless of whether or not you captured 
O5 or even N4.]))

middle.]))
