C[Hi, I'm you reviewer. My name is Pavel. 
My comments will start as [P\]:];B[pd];W[dd]
(;B[dq]C[[P\]: Stone 3 would be better to place at C4.
At this position white has good opportunity for strong attack supporteed by the stone at D16.

In fact, I prefere parallel fuseki, and I would make move 3 somewhere at the bottom-right corner]

(;W[qp]
(;B[kq]C[[P\]: Bad move, it's too earli to make such a big move. Black has his left bottom corner unprotected.]

(;W[nq]C[[P\]: reasonable move. But maybe quite passive]
(;B[mp]
(;W[pm]TR[np]C[Was q7 good, or should i have left the corner the way it was?
[P\]: Well, as for me, I would block at the triangled point]
;B[gp];W[do]C[here i felt that the bottom was getting pretty solid for black so i played here
[P\]: I belive you had to play here earlier];B[ci]TR[dm][cm]
[cl][ck][dk][dj][cj][dl]C[[P\]: Unreasonable move by black. Should be somewhere on the marked points]
;W[cl]C[[P\]: good responce. gaining base];B[cf];W[ce];B[df]

(;W[jd];B[mc]
(;W[qc]C[That probalby wasnt a good move because n17 is already there
[P\]: It's too early for san-san invasion. There are bigger points on the board]

(;W[nc];B[od];W[nb];B[nd];W[rb];B[sc];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[le]
;W[kc];B[qi]C[[P\]: quite a big point taken by black. White shoud have taken it earlier]

(;W[qj]C[[P\]: Don't touch the weak stones, or they'll become stronger. See alternative moves, they are better]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[gc]
(;W[gd]C[[P\]: Again the same advice: Don't touch weak stones]
;B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[jc]TR[kc][jd]C[[P\]: Waste of move, marked stones are already connected solidly. You only could make that move if black have played L16 before.]
;B[ec];W[dc]C[Was that move ok, or should i have tried to block Bs way to the center with e16?
[P\]: I think defending corner is good choice];B[db];W[cb];B[eb]
;W[ed]TR[cc]C[[P\]: Here you had left the cutting point unprotected]
;B[hd];W[he];B[fd];W[ge];B[fe];W[ff];B[ee]
(;W[de]C[[P\]: Again unnecessary solidification];B[ef]C[Not very happy about the result here]
;W[fg]C[F13 necessary?
[P\]: Well, it's a solid move. But it leaves black opportunity for H13]

(;B[bp];W[cp];B[cq];W[bo];B[bq];W[ip]C[I felt a need to try to invade on the bottom or black will gain too much there

[fk][fl]C[Wasnt sure what to do about blacks area around q14
[P\]: That territory already belongs to balck. There are not much you can do about it. But there is big piece of no ones territory on the left. You coud try to get it.]

[hf][gf][ae][bd][ac][pb][bb][ab][pa][na][ma][ba][aa]C[[P\]: Well, that's it. You've won. My congratulations.

At the end I would make some remarks.

1. Sometimes you play recklessly leaving holes in your defence, that gives your opponent opportunity to push you around.

2. Don't be greedy, don't try to grab all the oppenents territory. It's better to win being only 0.5 point ahead, that to loose trying to posses the whole board.

3. Territory on the border of spheres of influence, which can become either your or your opponents, depending on who move there first, has double value.

4. Do not loose tempo, don't make not necessary moves. Think about your stones like about investments. Investmenst should bring profit (with reasonable rate of risk)

5. Do not touch weak stones, especially invading weak stones. To kill them you only have to prevent them from building two eyes. Build a web around them]
