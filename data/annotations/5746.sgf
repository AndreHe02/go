C[Daedin: Hello

Daedin: I play with White, and would like as many comments as you can provide on the game, for both Black and White :)

Daedin: It was a close call at the end (B +2.5), and I know I lost some points in the very end game due to time pressure.
Daedin: During the game I thought White was doing ok, but at some points I felt like Black kept pushing the game, smothering White into submission.

Daedin: I am particularly interested in comments on the opening, since it has been known to be one of my weak points for a long time :)

Daedin: Thank you, and may you enjoy the game (Black and White both did ^^)


Hi, 

I am Peter Hoehe from Germany.
I prefix my commments with g4. go4fun is my kgs nick.
Hope that my comments are a little helpful.

Peter];B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[nc];W[pj]C[Daedin: At this point I did not clearly know what to do. Q10 looked very big for Black, and ok for White, so I chose to occupy the point.
g4: It's just a matter of style.];B[nq];W[kp];B[on];W[pn];B[oo]
;W[po];B[om];W[pl];B[mo]C[g4: Strange. Attacking from the other side seems natural.]
;W[kn]C[g4: Good.];B[pr];W[qq];B[kr];W[jr]C[g4: Overplay.];B[lq]
C[g4: Black should punish with K3 or L3 followed by K4.];W[lp]
C[g4: aji-keshi];B[mp];W[kq];B[mr]
(;W[fq]C[Daedin: Maybe a high approach at F4 would have been better ?
g4: Just a matter of taste. The high approach is going for influence. This builds territory.]

(;B[cn];W[fo]C[Daedin: Black C6 seemed submissive, but I couldn't help playing at F5 - it seemed an important point for both Black and White not to be flattened.
g4: F5 is big. The white group is living now, which is good.]
;B[dj]C[g4: Approaching the upper left corner would be normal.]
;W[cg];B[ci]C[Daedin: Would a play around G17 been better for Black ? On the moment I thought it rather small (even if it strengthened Black against an invasion at C9)
g4: I think so. I would prefer moves at F17 or R12 or J17.]
;W[qg];B[fc];W[hc]C[g4: This seems to me as on overplay. Black is stronger in that part of the board. So I would defend the corner.]
;B[kc]C[g4: F15 splitting white is better.];W[gd];B[dc];W[cc]
;B[cb]
(;W[ec];B[db]
(;W[cd];B[ed];W[ee];B[fd];W[fe];B[gb]C[Daedin: I think White mishandled this somehow (see vars.)
g4: I think black cut have cut here instead of defending. G15 seems difficult for white. As white didn't defend the corner he cannot hope for more.]
;W[hb]C[Daedin: Small ? (especially since L17 is low)
g4: Too small. And leaves the cut at G15. MOves at D2, D8, S16 are bigger.]
;B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[bb];B[eb]C[g4: B19 first.];W[dl];B[cl]
;W[co];B[do];W[cm];B[bm];W[dm];B[bl];W[dn];B[bn];W[ek]C[g4: Good sequence, expanding your moyo.]
;B[fi];W[gj];B[ge]C[g4: At last.];W[gi]C[g4: Small White gets a thick position, but cannot use this thickness.]
;B[he]C[g4: This is big.];W[fh]C[g4: Not enogh territory.];B[fj]
;W[fk];B[je]C[g4: Denying all aji. The game is close now.]
(;W[mm]C[Daedin: M8 better ?
g4: This move is fine.];B[ln];W[lm];B[km]C[g4: Overplay. White is strong. This is too deep.]
;W[jn]C[g4: Correct];B[kl];W[mk]C[Daedin: I felt White lost quite a lot there.]
;B[lk];W[lj]C[Daedin: Too aggressive ? White played it to prevent Black N8, but it still leaves the weaknesses in White's shape
g4: White is strong here. So beeing aggressive is ok. But it seems that N10 is good enough. White can cap blacks group at L13 for example.]
;B[kj];W[li];B[ki];W[lh];B[kh]
(;W[lg]C[g4: This is too mild. At least L13 now. See var.];B[hk]
C[g4: Bad. L13 connect the black string to the upper group and it is difficult for white to catch up.]

(;W[gk]C[g4: Unnecessary. L13 instead. See var.];B[hl]
(;W[kg]C[Daedin: H6 seemed to submissive.
g4: Good!];B[ii];W[ig];B[hn];W[ho]C[g4: When fighting it is important to destroy the opponent's shape. I would play J7 first.]
;B[in];W[io];B[jm];W[rd]C[g4: This is not enough.];B[rc];W[qe]
;B[qc];W[pe];B[re]C[Daedin: This was too soon I guess. Black lost sente to a small gain.
g4: Yes. Something around O14 seems better.];W[rf];B[sd];W[oc]
;B[od];W[nd]
(;B[ob];W[oe];B[pc];W[md]
(;B[dg]C[Daedin: Did Black misread something there, or was there really something to do in the area ?
g4: The biggest moves are on the side. Whit's answer is too ambitious. Compare the result to the variation.]

(;W[dh];B[ch];W[df];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[be];B[qr]C[Daedin: A few good yose moves from Black that White answered. Was there any point at which White should have ignored and played something bigger ? S2 seemed big, but M17 is worth more I thing, and Black can't really ignore E1 either can he ?
g4: The game is very close now. There is some aji in the H18 group. White should exploit this. E1 is double sente. Black has to answer at D1, but may tenuki white's F1.]

g4: I don't see it. What about O8?]
(;W[nj];B[ml];W[mj];B[nl]
(;W[lc]C[Daedin: White also felt like doing something around P3 but did not find anything that worked.]

(;B[gc]C[g4: G14 first.];W[gf];B[gd];W[ic]C[g4: This was definitely bigger than the loss of the 2 white stones.]
;B[jf];W[if];B[jg];W[ih];B[le];W[ld]C[g4: Better to play N15 directly.]
;B[lf];W[mf]C[g4: Losing sente];B[jh];W[mb];B[kb];W[mc]C[g4: O18 is shape.]
;B[ok];W[pk];B[oj];W[oi];B[pm];W[qm]C[Daedin: A lot of weaknesses in White shape around the M12 stones. Black couldn't exploit them, but was there anything relevant to do ?]
;B[pq]C[g4: This had been your sente.];W[qp];B[op];W[es];B[ds]
;W[fs];B[dr];W[dk];B[ck];W[qs]C[g4: Try to play sente moves first. How about D11 and M5?]

g4: Yes];B[fp]
(;W[hq]C[Daedin: Unnecessary I think
g4: I think too];B[en];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[qb]C[Daedin: Unnecessary I think. Black loses sente whil he still has some sente moves to play.

(;W[pi]C[Daedin: Unnecessary I think, but White did not have any time left to read through the sequence.
g4: That doesn't matter much now.];B[ca];W[ib];B[jb];W[cp]C[Daedin: Next moves from White are only to buy time to see if there is something left to be played.]

Daedin: It was a close and interesting game. I feel like both sides missed some important points, but no huge mistake overall (except maybe N7 instead of M8 for White ?)

Daedin: I hope you enjoyed the game.
