AB[gc][cg]C[Hello,
My name is Barry. I'm about a 10-11k on NNGS and 17k on IGS.  I've been playing go for a few years.  Sorry for the delay in getting this review to you, but I have been out of town for awhile.

You main problem in this game was that you played too defensively and did not secure territory with you initial moves.
Try to find moves with a dual purpose, attack and build territory with the same move.  The comments made by you opponent were generally correct.

Since you seem to be in the beginning stages, I would recommend getting a copy of the freeware program Igowin.  If you can't find it on the net let me know and I will get you a copy.  Igo win is a good opponent to play with on a 9x9 board.  You can play lots of games and it plays better games as you get stronger.

Keep on playing 9x9 games to help with your knowledge of life and death situtations.  This will help you learn what shapes to make when you nee to respond to an attack and how to attack your opponents.  I think this is the fasted way for beginners to improve.  It also helps with you reading skills.  There are several good books that would be very beneficial.

Please send me any questions you have.  It is easier for me to comment on a move If I know what you were thinking at the time.

Please email me at bcw0404@yahoo.com if you have any questions.

Best of luck and keep on playing.

Barry (bconwil on IGS, NNGS and KGS)];W[gg];B[dd]C[mauper [20k\]: d6 leaves the corner open

bw: Mauper is correct.  A move on the 3-3 point would have been better.]
;W[cc]C[labradors [?\]: again, feel free to comment as we go along.
mauper [20k\]: okay, I will
mauper [20k\]: now c7 lives in the corner
mauper [20k\]: the 3x3 (san san) normally lives if not too many b stones are around

bw:  mauper is correct.  He can now live in both corners.]
(;B[fd]C[bw: When you chose a move, look for one that serves a dual purpose.  For example, a move that attacks your opponents formation and secures territory for you would be the best move.  On this hand, d7 or c6 would have been a stronger move.]
;W[cd]
(;B[df]C[bw: While you have managed to connect you pieces, you have not secured much territory and have not put any pressure on you opponent.  You should keep in mind that connecting your groups was not that important since they can both live on the 3-3 points.

One important concept in the game of go is call sente.  Sente is a way of helping you control the game.  A move in sente is a move that forces you opponent to respond to your move.  A move in gote is a move that you opponent can ignore or that he does not have to respond. d4 was a move in gote.]
;W[ce];B[ee]C[bw: Another good rule of thumb when choosing a move is to consider whether the move makes a good shape.  While  this move is not exactcly a bad shape, it does not benefit your goal of gaining territory.]
;W[ge]
(;B[fe]CR[fd][ee]C[bw: This move was wasted.  The marked stones could not be split (see variation for an alternative)]
;W[gd]C[bw: your next move was f7.  I think a stronger move would have been d7.  Your territory would have still been safe. (See var)]

(;B[fc]CR[dc];W[dc];B[de];W[eg]
(;B[dg];W[eb];B[eh]C[bw:  Better, you trying to attack white and make him respond.]
;W[fh]C[mauper [20k\]: yes, start putting w under pressure]
;B[fi]C[bw:  You can't extend under like this.  White would have the advantage in this battle.]
;W[gi]C[mauper [20k\]: that was too much
labradors [?\]: pardon?
mauper [20k\]: you have to defend at d1
mauper [20k\]: if you want to keep f1 perhaps
mauper [20k\]: playing e1 is lethal
labradors [?\]: that was my thought for the next move.  was still looking at other areas.
mauper [20k\]: yes, there are bigger moves right now left
mauper [20k\]: maybe
mauper [20k\]:];B[di]C[bw : This is not bad if you wanted to start a ko fight.  But since white is so far ahead, it does not look like he is biting.]
;W[bf];B[ch]C[bw: ???  why not b3?];W[bg]C[mauper [20k\]: do much defense
mauper [20k\]: b3 would have been ok
labradors [?\]: okay.
mauper [20k\]: consider b2, h6 or f8
mauper [20k\]: or f4
labradors [?\]: I was thinking about b2, h6, or wondering if a sacrifice at f3 might bring anything good later.
mauper [20k\]: f3 is just plain self atari -> no gain
mauper [20k\]: but f4 is forcing move
labradors [?\]: so I see...just wanted to examine it to see if it would lead anywhere.]
;B[bh];W[ah]C[mauper [20k\]: try to stop w ealier on the border]
;B[bi]C[mauper [20k\]: you closed an eye
mauper [20k\]: if you want eyes, play e1
mauper [20k\]: e1 -> group lives
labradors [?\]: okay...was thinking it solidified the C1 eye, and wasn't that secure yet.
mauper [20k\]: but you can still take a huge part of the upper right corner
bw:  mauper is right about losing an eye.
labradors [?\]: ah...I see...
labradors [?\]: that's what I was trying to do....let's go with that, and see where it leads.]

labradors [?\]: a little better this time.
mauper [20k\]: normally I have to answer at g4]

(;B[hh]C[mauper [20k\]: yep
mauper [20k\]: now they are gone
mauper [20k\]: although still on the board
labradors [?\]: ah! so just leave them and count them later when removing dead stones? right?
mauper [20k\]: no way for me to save them
mauper [20k\]: yes, capture them only, if necessary];W[ig]

(;W[if];B[fg])
(;W[if]C[labradors [?\]: okay.
mauper [20k\]: one point more territory that way
mauper [20k\]: and you didnt waste a move
labradors [?\]: true.  do I need any more connection with the H2 group?
mauper [20k\]: c4 steals one point of mine
labradors [?\]: true.
mauper [20k\]: because I will have to defend the cut at b5 later
labradors [?\]: Okay.  but just for my understanding, does the h2 group need any further connection with the g4 group or the e1 group?
labradors [?\]: or is that considered connected enough already?
mauper [20k\]: nope, the whole thing is alive
labradors [?\]: okay.];B[cf];W[be];B[ai];W[ag]C[mauper [20k\]: over and out ;)
labradors [?\]: it looks like it...was about to pass.]))
(;B[hi]C[mauper [20k\]: also possible
mauper [20k\]: always stay calm and cool and count liberties]
;W[ih]C[labradors [?\]: the g2 was also so I would put your group in atari.
mauper [20k\]: yes, but they cannot escape anymore
labradors [?\]: that probably would have given me a little more territory.
labradors [?\]: just one or two points, perhaps.
mauper [20k\]: w cannot play j1 or g2]))
