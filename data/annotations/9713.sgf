C[The variation to move 19 is probably the most interesting, to me, and maybe to you.  Watch the ladders and ladder blockers, like that early ladder from the upper right being blocked by C3!  That's an important stone in that ladder, make sure you don't let it go!  Also, the resignation was premature, I tried to sketch out why in the last move.]

(;B[oe];W[ne]C[My joseki here is weak, but if you're playing the keima to the fifth line like you did, it seems to me you're trying to take the right side and leave white with the top.  A simple withdrawl here is better.]

;B[ph];W[cq]C[This breaks the ladder.]
(;B[cf]C[Here, you ignore the ladder breaker.  You need to either take at O15, or play another breaker above the stone on C3 like in the variation.]
;W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[This gives white what he wants. Variations that follow P3 are all black trying to make the best of a bad situation.  The kick is a nice move if there is a black stone around K; it's often a good joseki to learn to play with a handicap.  If white gets a three space extension from two stones, white can't ask for much better.]
;W[np]C[This is joseki, but black deviates widely.  The joseki is in the variation]

(;B[oo]C[Try to stick to the third and fourth lines during the opening, as a rule.  Also, the tiger's mouth shape here is formed with a peep aimed right at it from O4, which makes an otherwise great fighting shape look silly.]
;W[mn]C[white's trying to encircle that big area that worries you here.]

(;B[nn]C[black contacts, which will make white's silly wall become stronger!]

(;B[ll]C[Okay, keep in mind, these lines of variations from the kick at P3 are ones to be avoided.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cd]C[Good instincts.  With a one space low pincer from white, like this, you can jump right into the corner at 3-3. I'll confine my review of this move to the idea you attempted, but if you jump to 3-3/]
;W[cc];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[ck]C[Here, black has a tiny base, though he should be okay, but white took fourth line territory and grabbed a base for his pincer.

The approach at c14 is misplaced to begin with.  After breaking the ladder at D4, and playing out the joseki there, the approach from this side looks better, but I'd still play out the joseki in the lower left, and aim at approaching low from the top, at f17.]

[jr][ks][cb][ca][jc][kc][lc][mc][oc][pc][qf][rf][sf]C[Although it's late, there's still the 4-4 approach to that 3-3 point (see variation to 19) to try to take away territory in the lower left, and if you capture O15 (!!!) you could possibly get a huge territory that stretched from the right side to that wall on top.  Look at the lines where white has stones close, triangled.  Look where black's walls are aiming to join up.  Push from black's open areas into white's with moves like e10, and fight it out, this game isn't lost yet!

The main lesson of this review is, I think, the variations stemming from move 19, and that this game isn't actually over yet, you still had good chances.]
)
(;B[cc];W[cd]C[white will probably pick this side, because a play at d17 would make a wall facing black's wall.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc]C[This is a joseki I know.  It is better, but a counter pincer after playing out the lower 4-4 joseki would have been better (see variation to 19)]

;B[no]C[black can nip through the wall.];W[mo];B[mp]C[This might work.  At this point, keep in mind that the wall white built is based on black's kick at P3.  White makes errors after then which black can take advantage of, but P3 is still causing black difficulties.  Check out the alternates to P3.]
)))
(;B[pn];W[jq]LB[jp:a]C[white has a perfect extension at 24 or A.  Kicking at P3 is only advised if there is a black stone to back you up around K.  Black can tennuki or play to solidify the right side.  I would STILL play D4 if I had the chance.]
))
(;B[pn]C[Alternate to P4.
Simply taking the side is nice.  Here, I think you can play high, instead of at A, because you have nice back-up above, although that might be a matter of debate.]
;W[pr];B[qq]C[must defend; white takes the corner if he plays here.]
;W[kq];B[pk]TR[fq][ep][fp][dp][hq][gq][co][eq]C[If white plays this common joseki all the way out, black gets a great side, while white is very low on the bottom and is open to invasion or capping off around the triangles, not right now but later!]
)
(;B[np]C[Alternate to P4.  This is nice too, takes the side, which is nicely walled off above (as long as you make sure O15 falls, as I've said elsewhere).]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[kq];B[pn]C[Nice little grab, if you can get it.  This is joseki.  White, however, is still looking squashed.  Black has bracketed a huge side territory.  This move is necessary to protect the cut at p4.]
))
(;B[dp]C[Natural.

Both builds nice influence for black, and breaks the ladder from O15 in your favour again.  O15 splits black, so is an important stone to make sure remains captured.]

Look at the outline of the X's there, that's your aim from here on out.  And you might have a shot at actually killing a part or the whole of the white group and getting that territory too.]
