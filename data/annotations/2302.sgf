AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello!  My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.

I believe your biggest problem is not reading sequences out far enough/well enough.  (I should add, however, that I make bad mistakes in reading, and so do players much stronger than me.)  There were a few cases where you missed sequences that would have been a substantial gain for you -- especially Black 140 and Black 218.

Also, I think you played several moves with the intention of trying to save a single stone which really wasn't worth trying to save.  Black 140 is an example of this as well.]

;W[bd];B[cc];W[dh];B[gf]C[Ted: I'm not so sure this is the best move.  I would try either Q10 or R10.  I'm guessing that you wanted to stop White from jumping out into the center, but your two groups (on the top and on the bottom) should make it relatively difficult for White to get central territory.]
;W[qj];B[oj]TR[pd][pp]C[Ted: I think an extension from one of the two corner stones would be better here.]
;W[hq];B[hp];W[qh];B[qf];W[lc];B[jb];W[nc];B[pc];W[le];B[kg]
C[Ted:  I'm not so sure about this move.  White shouldn't be able to get a whole lot of territory running out into the center, so if you play something simple that keeps your stones connected (say, K14), you should be able to make some territory for yourself while limiting what White can get.

Better yet is to ignore it entirely and play something like R7 or N3.]
;W[rg];B[rf];W[sg];B[sf];W[mf];B[og]C[Ted: I don't think this move is necessary, either.  The stones in the top right are alive as is, and rather than worrying about trying to kill every last opponent's stone, you would be better off allowing your opponent to get a small amount of territory here while making more territory in another part of the board.]
;W[je]C[Ted: Now White can put some pressure on the L13 stone.]
;B[ie];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[he];W[mh];B[lj];W[ig];B[gh]C[Ted: Let White connect to the stones on the left.  Your stones on the fourth line at the bottom will make it difficult for either side to get territory in the center, and while White is connecting, you can make territory elsewhere (bottom right!)]

;W[mj];B[mk];W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[mg]C[Ted: This isn't really necessary.  The White groups on the right and at the top are both alive anyhow; White's next cut is much more damaging.]
;W[ol];B[nm];W[pm];B[om];W[qm]
(;B[qk]TR[pl][ql]C[Ted: Sacrifice those two stones and look to get territory.  If you play at Q6, White still has to respond.

The Q/R8 stones have aji -- in and of themselves they're not going to survive, but the threat to do something that will bring them back to life can be used to get you something elsewhere.]

C[Ted: You really needed to plat at L4 here to stop White's threats to connect those stones to something else.  Let White connect N6 to the N4/N3 stones -- where will White get two eyes?]

(;B[jo]C[Ted: I think you should have sacrificed the K4 stone and played at M4 instead.  See the variation.]
