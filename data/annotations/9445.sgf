AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Nine-stone handicap game and 5.5 komi for black. It's quite normal for white, being a lot strong, to have the upper-hand when fights break out. But still, I'm not that happy about how much. This game was played on IGS, between an 8k+ and an 16k. My opponent bolted the moment I made, what I consider, my first decent move of the game. Given how previous fights went, I think he still had a 50/50 chance of winning.

TM: Hi, my name is Tomas and I will be reviewing your game. I will preface my comments with "TM".

I will try my best to give you some useful advice, but this game is not a very good choice for a review. As this is a 9 stone handicap game, there is almost no strategy involved. The game is decided mostly by reading mistakes and that's something you can easily review yourself.

If you want to get better at go, my personal advice would be not to play high-handicap games at all. Allways review your games. Find your mistakes and play better next time. When you cannot find any mistakes, send the game for a review. Unless you're a high-dan player, there are probably some moves that could have been better with respect to high-level strategy. That's something a review from a stronger player can help you with. Reading mistakes - not so much, as reading is something you need to train a lot.

Another thing you can do to get better at reading is solving tsumego.]

(;B[qe];W[pe]C[I researched and this is not a joseki, I think he wanted to use his superior fighting skills. I think I did ok. I actually wanted to have te right side and in a minute he's going to take it. Any remarks?

TM: You might actualy be the one not playing joseki here. That aside, handicap games are not about joseki. They are mostly decided by fighting and thats what white does here.

I would try to save the corner first, then gain some territory on side by attacking white, while he's busy trying to live on the other side. You cannot  kill every stone white plays. You have to let him have his territory too. Just make sure it's smaller than yours.

You were given very large influence at the beginning of the game. You shoul use it to attack. But that attack serves to keep white small and secure you some territory in the process. You must of course threaten white's life. But if you try too hard, you'll just get killed yourself, since white is 9 stones stronger and he sure has a much better chance at close combat. 

You should not be picking a side in advance. Save the corner, wait for white to pick a side and let him live there. Make him live small and take territory on the other side.]

For my next moves I wanted to play something like K6 to increase my territory and follow up by something like N14 or K12. Any thoughts?

TM: In this game, you mostly made reading mistakes. To learn to read, you need to play a lot of games on long time limit and concentrate on reading every possible move.  You can also do some tsumego.

Dont' try to kill evething. It is often better not to kill the group and gain something (territory or influence) from the attack, than ending with bad shape after trying to kill too forcefully.

Thanks for submiting your game and have fun playing Go!])
