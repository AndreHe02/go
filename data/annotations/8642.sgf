C[i was black but welcome comments about both sides because will is my friend and I will send him the comments

thanks

forfun (hereafter "ff") - This was a fun game to analyze. If there was one comment that I would make about Black it would be "Overoptimistic about surrounding territory"! :-) What I mean is that Black kept wanting to settle the position by enclosing territory - when Black was not actually winning. If we look back at the game, Black only once sets out to attack a White stone, the original D12 pincer stone in the upper left. After that Black kept thinking that (or wondering whether) it would be enough to surround some center territory. Go has to be more balanced and more aggressive. In the end of this game Black tried a desperate comeback, did some nice reading, and scored a completely unexpected victory. Well done! Just don't make a habit of it. :-)]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[ericosman [1k\]: so far not bad];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
;W[dh]C[ff - Amongst the pros the pincer is a liitle unusual, since C15 is played so often.]
;B[ge]C[ff - This is an unsual choice in this position at the professional level. Basically Black plays the 2-space jump in order to play elsewhere as soon as possible. In this position, there is no really urgent play elsewhere on the board since all the other corners are 4-4 stones.

Basically in playing against the 2-space high pincer, there is one key question - should Black decide to attack the pincer stone or not? If the lower left corner is Black, the answer is normally "yes". In that case, Black will most often play the 1-space jump to F15 and counter-pincer White within the next few plays. If the lower left corner is White, as it is here, then Black chooses the large-knight's move at G16 by a wide margin.

Using the 2-space jump here is a kind of half-measure. It is thinner than the 1-space jump so it does not support an attack on D12 as well. Meanwhile it does not turn against the corner stone, so has less effect than G16 or E17 It is not a bad enough play to strongly influence the result of an amateur game. :-) However, we should realize that it indicates that Black is not really familiar with the implications of the various joseki choices here. More study is indicated. ;-)]
;W[gc]C[apparently only f17 for w is joseki,  true ?  if so, how should black punish ?  with e16 force?

ff - The source of the idea above is not indicated so it is hard to respond to. Both G17 and F17 have been played by the pros, with F17 seen about twice as often as G17. In both cases, Black's strategic ideas are the same, either try to turn around the head of White's stones or play elsewhere. So far in this game all the plays have been normal, there is no reason to expect that Black can "punish" White's play.]
;B[id]C[black didn't punish.  should w punish ?  how ?  with e15 ?

ff - There is the saying, "The best revenge is living well." This situation is similar in a way. By jumping out and provoking White to extend along the top, Black has no very severe follow up at the top. The play at J16 is the most frequently seen continuation when pros as Black continue locally. However, White usually just plays elsewhere.]
(;W[ce]C[ff - Since White is not in danger here, it is not a good idea to play like this. It strengthens Black's original 2-space jump and badly weakens the D12 stone. See the variations for alternatives to consider.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[df]
(;W[ic]C[ff - White can not play this now, it contradicts D15 etc. White needs to protect the D12 stone instead. Although that is not ideal since it is White's previous play that has put it in danger.]
(;B[jd]C[ff - This seems the right idea here. See the variation.]
;W[jc];B[kd];W[hd];B[he];W[kc]
(;B[dk]C[ff - The pushing along the top is very much in Black's favor. There is no rush to play here. The wall is so high that there is no good way to attack White's single stone profitably. See the variation.]
;W[ld]C[ff - This hurts! Black should never voluntarily let White hane at the head of three stones like this. In the present situation this stone also slaps Black's Q16 in the face as well.]
(;B[jf]C[ff - This seems too submissive to me. See the variations.]
;W[le];B[ed]C[is this too slow ?

ff - What does this protect against? If Black does not play this now, what will White do to take advantage in this area?]
;W[ec]
(;B[gj]C[ok or too territory oriented ?

ff - This looks too small. Playing to capture only one stone with the number of stones Black invested in the wall can not be efficient. See the variation.]
;W[cm]
(;B[cl]C[ff - See the variation.];W[dm]
(;B[fq]C[ff - Invites the pincer. Is this too close after the C8, D7 exchange has strengthed White? See the variation.]
(;W[iq]C[ff - See the variation.]
(;B[cq]C[ok ?  or should black jump up to f5 instead ?

Black is counting on some sort of influence-based strategy after giving White the top. Jumping in to take the lower left corner is inconsistent with his previous play. See the variations...]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo]
(;W[fp]C[ericosman [1k\]: was expecting white b7 instead of f4
is white b7 or b6 better than f4 ?
what about e9 for white ?

ff - My first reaction was that B7 is absolutely necessary. Bridging under at B8 seems like a huge play for B as it affects both the center and the bottom left. At the same time, however, it does not impact White after F4 so W has the initiative on the rest of the board. Black loses the opportunity to build a framework to use the wall in the top center. In the end, I think this idea of White's is good from the whole-board point of view.]
;B[bm]C[ff - The two White stones at D7 look strangely placed. However, we can think of them as kikashi that push Black down to the second line on the left and leave behind aji around E9 that White may be able to use in the future.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[ff - It is hard to figure out how to settle the Black stone while helping White the least here. This may be the most reasonable idea for Black.]
;W[pg]
(;B[qe];W[of];B[pe]
(;W[og]C[s14 better ?

ff - That would depend on how B answered it. What plan did you have? This connection is basically in the wrong direction. White's M15 stone is already incredibly strong. White should not want to build so much additional strength right next to it.]
(;B[oc];W[rf];B[re];W[pk];B[qg]C[ff - This is a fundamental error. Black is completely alive in the corner. There is no reason to take two stones in gote.]
;W[qh];B[rg]C[bad gote ?

ff - Frankly, terrible! :-)];W[rh];B[sf]
(;W[qn]C[ff - This looks like a mistake in direction to me. I believe that White should approach along the bottom. Fundamentally the bottom is larger than the right side now. See the variation.]
(;B[kq]C[
if i had a second chance, i think for black i might play r5 instead of L3]
;W[nq];B[pn];W[pm];B[qo];W[on];B[po];W[no];B[oq];W[nr]C[i don't like black L3]
;B[io]
(;W[jp]C[my intention was to give up L3 and try to make more in middle than white has on sides

ff - That is a reasonable plan since L3 can not do much for Black anymore. One question is whether Black can afford to play away from the lower right corner - but let's assume that is OK. Another question is what if White answered with an all out attempt to catch Black. See variation...]
(;B[kn];W[jo];B[jn];W[in]
(;B[jj];W[im]
(;B[fl]C[is f8 ok ?

ff - The exchange of F8 for L8 should lose the game outright. :-) This play contradicts the idea behind J5.]
;W[kl]C[ff - Up to here White has gained more territory than Black in the center. We can say that Black's idea with J5 has not worked.]
;B[kh]C[is this ok ?  or does black need to help lower right instead ?

ff - This is tiny. There is no way that White can break through here. It looks like it might be worth ~5 points?]
(;W[pr];B[np];W[mp];B[qm];W[ql]
(;B[om]C[ff - Black can pobably live by playing S7 (see the variation), but could never win that way. Black is right to seek complications as a last chance effort.]
(;W[nm]C[ff - White would be better off to take the R7 stone. Black is really struggling here. See the variation.]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[qk];B[op]
(;W[qq]C[ff - This is an overplay by W since later B uses the cut at N3.]
;B[nl];W[ok];B[or];W[os];B[mm];W[nn]C[ff - This is the last chance. Throughout, W did not take into consideration B's potential to use all the cutting points in W's position.]
