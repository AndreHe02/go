Hi. My name is Norman. On KGS, my account is Norman314, and I am ranked 5 kyu.

I will mark your comments with your name. All other comments are mine.


Here are some of the most important lessons to be learned from this game.

1) It is easier to make territory in the corners and edges than in the center.
2) When the opponent approaches or invades your corner, it is urgent to respond locally.
3) Don't overconcentrate your stones. Your stones don't have to be touching each other -- they can be loosely connected instead.
4) Contact moves strengthen both sides. Do not play right next to your opponent's stones if they are weak.
5) The 4-4 stone does not defend territory in the corner. Rather, it protects the center from the corner. If white invades, you will gain outside influence. But if white does not invade, you will in most cases eventually want to protect the corner by playing a stone at 4-3 or thereabout.

I hope my comments will be useful to you. If you have further questions, feel free to send me an email at Norman314@gmail.com]
;W[dm];B[cn];W[fm];B[fn]C[A move like this where your stone touches (contacts)  the opponent's stone, and neither stone is connected to others, is called an attachment. Attachments usually make both sides stronger, so you should avoid playing them if your opponent's stone is weak, unless your stone is also weak. Here, thanks to your 9 handicap stones, you are in a strong position, so you should not play attachments.]

;W[cc]C[Nathan:

At this point white has played very heavily in the upper left
corner.  I made the conscious decision when they started playing
there to let them have that territory rather than spreading myself
too thin and trying to cover the whole board.

Was this a poor/wrong decision?


Norman:
Well, at this point, your D16 stone is mostly dead. But nonetheless, you should not ignore it completely. You might be able to use it for something later.]

move.

(;B[mj]LB[jg:a]MA[ll][nm][kn][ln][mn]C[Nathan: 

My purpose in playing this stone was to cut off the white group
marked with X's, but when reviewing the game I wondered if I
would have been better off taking a more aggresive approach by
playing at A.  This would have left the white group the chance of
expansion but would have also gained me more territory
(potentially).

Was I right in where I played or should I have played A?

Norman:
N10 is an okay move. It is kind of overconcentrated, but not nearly as bad as your moves at K8 and K9. Now the marked white group has has virtually no potential left, and you are starting to build a framework on the top as well.]

I think I should have played either A or B.
How should I have recovered from this error?

A and B are not good moves. Remember, it is easier to make territory in the corner and on the side than on the center. You want to attack white's invading stone while making territory.]

in this game) I find myself losing focus and playing
very reactively.  Its not that I mentally lose focus (I can focus on
one thing for hours) but in the game itself I lose focus.  I struggle
to know where to focus my energy and attention and end up
playing very reactively.  I feel like I'm just holding off the
floodwaters, responding to my oponent and therefore letting
them "run the show".
Nathan:

The alternative to me seems to be focusing on my territory and
where I want to build it and putting my energy and attention
there, however, when I've done that, I find myself blindsided by
the opponent and lose even worse...

This is the weakest part of my game (I think) and I really don't
know what to do.  Basically, in the mid game I go reactionary, but
when I haven't played that way then I lose even worse.

Suggestions?

(How could I have better protected the lower left corner?  The
lower right corner?  How could I have kept my upper center
territory from bottlenecking?  Where did I go wrong?  What don't
I see (even upon review)?  I think that's what bothers me most,
even in looking back over it I still don't know what I could have
done differently...  I mean, I see little stupid plays that were a
mistake where I just wasn't looking far enough ahead I guess,
but I feel like I need an overall shift in perspective that I haven't
realized yet.)


Norman:
At this point, the game is pretty much over. White is way ahead, and you will not be able to catch up in the endgame. I think I have answered most of your questions here elsewhere. To reiterate: 

1) It's easier to make territory in the corners and on the sides than in the center.
2) When the opponent approaches or invades your corner, it is very urgent to respond. 
3) Don't overconcentrate your stones.]N[Where to focus?!];B[cm]

This is honestly one of my best games, which is why I'm sending it
in for review.  Many of my games end worse than this, I would
have lost even the middle of the board which I somehow
maintained in this game.  But I want this game reviewed because
my other games I see mistakes all over when I look back over it,
but this one I see some subtle flaws, but overall I'm not sure
what I could have done better/differently.

I obviously lost 34 points in the lower left and right corners.  But
how could I have kept this from happening?
I also made no real offensive moves into white's territory in the
upper left.  But how could I have?  When should I have?

My offense is lacking, my defense is scattered...
