Hi, I'm Julian and I am your reviewer for this game.

I already looked through the game and I know where your problem lies: The balance between territory and influence.

There are two main factors in go: Territory and influence. While territory determines who wins, influence is the means to get territory.

In the corner fights you stressed territory. You took the corners, but at the price of being completely sealed in. You had little potential of expansion or attack on white's territory.

If you're unfamiliar with some of the go terms I use, you can look them up on sensei's library: senseis.xmp.net

Now let's dig into the details...];B[pd];W[dp]C[pedres [19k?\]: Hello, good game]
;B[dc];W[pp]
(;B[qf]C[This is an unusual spot for black's third stone. With the variant - C15 - you ensure a large corner and a strong influence on the top part of the board.]
;W[fd];B[df]C[Correct direction of play, although I personally find 2-space jumps hard to defend.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[ef];B[dd];W[ee];B[fc]C[Very good so far - you stopped white from gaining a secure footing. However, a shape like at D15 must always be treated with greatest care, since white can cut.]
;W[be]
(;B[cd]C[This is your first mistake in the game. You want to have the corner territory, so you play submissive stones to keep it. Cuts are never a nice thing, but try to read out the continuation if you play at B14 instead.]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[bh]
(;B[fe]C[A change of direction is not bad here, but you need to know your goals. This play is not a strong attack on white (as would be E13) nor does it allow you to increase your territory (as would G16).

A general rule is: Never assume your enemie's mistake!];W[ge]
;B[ff];W[fg]
(;B[ed]C[Correct not to go on, as the ladder would get you captured in the end anyway, but you could use the opportunity to place a ladder breaker (e.g. at Q6).]
;W[gf];B[gd]C[Here you threaten an unimportant stone. White plays correctly when he ignores it.]
;W[bf];B[bd]C[This play was unneccessary. Your group could easily have survived a white play here. Better to use the initiative to start an attack on your own, instead of defending the whole game.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fe]C[I really wonder why you didn't extend instead of taking the stone...]
;W[hd];B[fd];W[gb];B[ff];W[eg];B[gg];W[fb];B[eb];W[hf];B[ag]
C[These stones are dead, no use in playing there.];W[ah];B[qn]
C[I reckon there are better ways to defend but I am quite happy with the result. At least I have saved the corner and I have a pretty nice group fully alive.

----

The result is nothing to be happy with. You have 12 points of territory in the upper left corner. In return white got strong walls toward the top and lefthand sides.

Later on, white will make use of his strength towards the right, when he cuts your stones and forces you to live small.

The attack at R6 is placed correctly though, since proper responses to white's defensive plays could allow you to make lots of territory on the right.]
;W[gh]C[pedres [19k?\]: sorry, I lost connection]
(;B[np]C[Again, a ladder breaker such as P6 would have worked better. After white's response you can build a large framework on the left.]
;W[pn]C[This situation screams for the attach-and-extend joseki.]
(;B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[qq];W[rn];B[pq]C[Correct! If you can connect to the O4 stone, you can start to build territory on the lower side.]
;W[qm];B[sp];W[sn];B[oq];W[op];B[mq]C[Very good so far.];W[jq]
C[I was able to steal a corner so far so good.

----

If white streches so far towards a stable position of yours, a pincer is in order]
(;B[lc]C[You can prepare such an extension with a kikashi - a forcing move that doesn't need immediate backup, like J17.

Also look at the pincer alternative.];W[lq]
(;B[lr]C[This one should really have gone above his stone!]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[kr]
(;B[mr];W[lb]
(;B[mb]C[Make connecting your stones a priority. Connected stones are stronger than separated ones. By cutting you in half white destroys some of your corner territory AND gains ever more influence in the center.]
;W[nb];B[mc];W[nd];B[kb];W[ma];B[la];W[pc];B[od];W[ob];B[qc]
;W[qb]
(;B[pb]C[S18 might seem bold, but it wins!];W[pa];B[pc]C[The stone at Q18 is unsubstantial. Better play at S18 to close off the corner.]
;W[md]
(;B[ld]C[This move is very tame. It is obvious that your L18 group will not make a lot of territory, so look for a quick way to live.

Also, now you really feel the pressure of the white wall. That is why influence is important.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[le];B[ke];W[rc]C[Everything goes according to white's plan. It is obvious what his moves want to achieve, so look for a way to resist.]
(;B[rd]C[S18 would still have worked!];W[of];B[rb];W[re];B[qa]
;W[me]
(;B[oa]C[Another unimportant stone you captured. You could have made some territory by extending on the right, or started a new attack on the huge area in the bottom left.]
;W[na];B[pa];W[kf];B[jd];W[pf];B[qe];W[je];B[kd];W[id];B[ic]
;W[hc];B[jc];W[no]
(;B[mp]C[Again, you need to start looking for plays that stop white from achieving his goal (here: extending his positions).]
;W[lp];B[mo];W[qg]
(;B[rf]C[This is way to submissive. Your group is alive so you can resist his attack. You might even choose to ignore it and attack the lower left before it's too late!]
;W[so];B[rp];W[rg]C[And by here I have lost a very nice part of territory, big enough to decide the final result. So I assume I have already made several big mistakes from the last comment to here.
It didn't look that bad to me while I was playing, I had several groups alive..., but unconnected. So I decided to start to attack from N5 but I was unable to get good results.

---

Yes, by defending constantly, you allowed white to gain the upper hand in return for only 30-something points in the corners.]
;B[se];W[af];B[nn];W[on];B[nm];W[lo]C[Correct idea: reduce white's territory.]
;B[ln];W[om];B[kn];W[ko];B[jn];W[jo];B[in];W[nl]
(;B[ml]C[You don't have to play near white's last stone!];W[mm]

;W[ck]C[This was a long sequence with several mistakes on both sides. But those were all lokal considerations. That's not why you lost.]
;B[sg];W[sh];B[rh]C[Correct position to begin the endgame, but this move was a mistake.]

A few final remarks:

- You had lost once the top corner was settled. White had solid walls facing the entire board, making it impossible for you to make additional territory and making it hard for you to reduce white's. 

- In addition to learing how to build and use influence, you need to loosen your game from your opponents move. You don't always have to respond around his last played stone. 

- The most important thing in a corner is to build a position you can expand from or that you can rely on. 

- Connecting your stones will make them stronger. Dividing enemy stones will make them weaker.

- Try to leave a situation earlier. Once you are sure you can survive any move your opponent makes, attack a different spot. That way your opponent will not be able to build such an owerwhelming influence.

I hope my review helps you improve your game. It was fun to do. If you don't understand one of my remarks, feel free to send me an email, I'll gladly explain more.]
