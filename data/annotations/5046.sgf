;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[od]C[Hi I'm alex and i have a few questions for you. Thank you for helping

What whould you say i should do

z -- Hello Alex.  I am Bill, "zinger" in the internet Go community.  I am glad to review your game.  My comments are marked "z --".  Remember that I am also a weak amateur, and only a little stonger than you.  So be sure to consider my comments and variations critically - almost certainly, I have made a few mistakes.  

z -- I prefer to reference move numbers and board markings in my comments, rather than grid coordinates.  Hopefully you have an SGF reader which displays these properly.  I recommend glGo, which I used to make the review.

z -- There were some strategic mistakes in the opening and early middle game, but really this game came down to a big fight in the center.  Black could have won at move 133, but missed it.  Still it might have been close if black had lived in the bottom right at move 177.  So, based on this game I would say to mostly work on your reading.  Also, keep in mind the proverb "urgent moves before big moves" - black played away from a fight twice, at 47 and 67, when local moves were urgent.

Good luck !];B[mc];W[dd]
(;B[fc]LB[qo:B][oc:A]C[z -- I would prefer A or B over 7.  A would connect your stones and make the white stone there almost worthless.  B is big by itself.  Because 5 is low, on the third line, 7 is less appealing - the black stones end up a little inefficient.]
;W[fd]C[other joseki?];B[gd];W[fe];B[ec];W[dc];B[ic]TR[mc]LB[gc:B]
[id:A]C[should this stone be somewhere else?

z -- black needs a move around here somewhere, but the normal joseki moves don't relate very well with the marked stone.  Perhaps black A could be played, but that would leave more aji around the cut at B.]
;W[df];B[fq];W[qo];B[op];W[qm]C[z -- a mistake: too close.]

(;B[cn]LB[qp:A]C[z -- black should play at A, taking a large corner.]
;W[cq]
(;B[ip]LB[eo:A]C[z -- this move seems a little soft.  I would seal white in by playing A.  Black can survive the cuts, and then white will have to live on the inside, probably in gote.]
;W[dn]
(;B[cl]LB[dm:A]C[z -- black should hane at A for better shape.]
;W[dm]C[now what?

z -- not sure.  Your move looks OK.];B[cm];W[co]
(;B[ci]LB[eo:A]C[z -- of course black must play here, but first A looks like a good kikashi.]
;W[lq]LB[jq:B][hq:A]C[how would you attack?

z -- black has a weak spot at A which needs to be protected for an attack to work.  I suggest black B.]

(;B[lo]TR[qm][dm][dn]LB[jq:A]C[z -- black is not thick enough for this to work.  White can live inside.  The outside influence black gets in return is not fully effective because of the marked white stones.  Black A looks better.]
;W[nq];B[mp];W[ir]
(;B[kr]LB[jq:A]C[z -- since black ends up losing this stone anyway, something else should be considered.  I suggest A.]
;W[kp];B[ko];W[jq]
(;B[iq]LB[jp:A][kq:B][jo:C]C[z -- black A instead might be better.  White pretty much has to connect at B.  Also, a cut at C becomes less worrisome because it can be captured in a ladder, at least for now.]
;W[jr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[jp];B[jo];W[or];B[hr];W[ls];B[pf]
TR[qm]LB[oc:A][hn:B][np:C][qp:D][eo:E]C[z -- Strategically, the right side is not valuable because of the low, strong position of the marked white stone.  Black A is better locally.  But really I think any tenuki is bad in this position.  Black has two serious cutting points left behind - this is too much.  If I  were black, I would defend with B, C, or D.  The peep at E is also still available.]
;W[io]C[z -- a good cut.]
(;B[ho]LB[gp:A][eo:B]C[z -- playing atari helps white gain momentum to attack on the other side of the cut.  I think black A is better.  Also, observe how a stone at B would have helped black in the following moves.]
;W[in];B[hn];W[im]
(;B[fo]LB[eo:A]C[z -- now A is definitely better.];W[np];B[no]
;W[oo]C[z -- another good cut.  Black's next few moves are very painful, but this is what happens when too many cuts are left behind.]
;B[qp];W[po];B[rr];W[nn];B[kl];W[mo]LB[hm:A]C[z -- this doesn't look important right now.  I think white should turn at A instead.]
;B[km];W[hl];B[fl]LB[lp:A]C[z -- by the way, good style in not playing A now or anytime.  It looks like a free move, but the chance to play it isn't going away for a long time, and the liberty may be important later.]
;W[dl];B[bf]LB[gk:A][ik:B]C[z -- this almost looks like a large endgame move.  Black and white each have a potentialy weak group in the center: this is no time for point snatching.    Black A or B would be better.]
;W[fk];B[gl];W[gk];B[hk];W[ik];B[hj];W[ek];B[hm];W[il];B[ij]
;W[jk];B[lj]C[z -- good];W[jj];B[ih];W[ki];B[li];W[kh];B[mg]
C[z -- good];W[ig];B[hg];W[hf];B[jg];W[if];B[jh];W[kg];B[jf]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[me]
(;B[of]LB[le:A][ke:B]C[z -- I don't see what white is threatening, that should cause black to make such a passive defensive move.  Cutting at A does not seem to work; how about peeping at B?  The variations are not absolute, of course, but it looks like black can fight more strongly.]
;W[kd];B[jd];W[kc];B[ke];W[le];B[nd];W[ne];B[oc];W[mh]C[where would you play?

z -- same as you did.  But differently next move.];B[lh];W[lg]

(;B[ni]LB[nj:A]C[z -- maybe something a little looser, such as A.]
;W[nh];B[oh]C[beacuse this doesn't work

z-- no indeed.  But black gets more chances later.];W[nf];B[og]
;W[ng];B[oj]
(;W[jb]LB[ib:A]C[z -- it looks like white could do better with A instead.]
;B[ib];W[lb];B[mb];W[ka];B[lc];W[lk];B[kk];W[ie];B[je];W[hh]
;B[hi];W[gg];B[ld];W[oe];B[pc];W[ln]C[where here?

z -- see next comment.]
(;B[kn]LB[lm:A]C[z -- black A instead would maintain connection all around.  This would leave white dead in the center, and black would win easily.]

;W[qs];B[rs];W[os]
(;B[sq]LB[sp:A]C[z -- this move allows white to start a ko for the corner aytime he wants by playing A.  Black should play A himself instead, which lives unconditionally.  It's a big difference.]
;W[rn]C[z -- unnecessary move.];B[ce];W[de];B[bc];W[gi];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[er];W[sp]C[z -- this ko completely favors white.  Black can die, but white can't lose anything at all.]
;B[so];W[id];B[jc];W[sp]LB[fh:A]C[any good threats?

z -- Black could try A, which white will gladly answer and keep playing the ko.  But this should not have been a ko at all, per comment at 177.]
;B[ji]C[z -- Black can't win the ko, but could at least play a real endgame move somewhere.  White still has too many liberties for black to make a seki, so this move is just a pass.]
;W[so];B[pe]C[z -- white could ignore this as well.  Both players pass for several moves now.  Was this a fast game, without time to count liberties?]
;W[ll];B[lm];W[jl];B[mi];W[jm];B[pd];W[jn];B[md];W[ml];B[kf]
C[z -- this is still a pass.];W[gj];B[ii];W[ln]C[z -- yet another pass.  But the game is over anyway.]
