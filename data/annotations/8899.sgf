rarellano [5k\]: Hi

Hi reviwer, I'm rarellano 5k (black). And I lost by 18.5 points. I feel the game was close. I got the four corners but was not enougth.

Hope to get some general advice on the opening and reveal the mistakes.
 thanks in advance.

K: Let's start!
I will add a general comment at the end of the game.
I will write my comments as "K:"

;W[qq];B[fp]C[K: It is really difficult to tenuki at this point on the joseki in the lower-right corner. Almost any move by W is sente.
The left hoshi stone is still safe, thanks to C8. You can expect a severe counterattack!]

(;B[ep];W[do];B[dq];W[eo];B[cq];W[bp]TR[gp]C[K: this is a really good result for you. W is oveconcentrated and you have a nice side, with a lot of further potential.
You have to fix your shape with G4 soon, to avoid being pressed.]

C[K: This is strange, but good!
Opening in 3-3 is usually for territory only, no influence, and you used your C17 to build a nice sente wall and attack. It is a brave change of strategy.]
(;B[cg];W[ec];B[dd];W[dc];B[cd];W[hd]TR[pb][cj][qj]C[K: here you can tenuki, you don't want to secure any territory now, and there are too little points to defend.
Tenuki is the only option.

There is not really a good answer to this invasion, it is destructive anyway, because you can't hane at right because of the marked point, and you can't hane at left, because of O3-Q2 that are under attack.]

(;B[di]TR[pj]C[K: both the marked stones are to avoid.
The center is really small in this game, because there are six groups contending it! too many to squeeze enough points. You just need to be sure that your opponent don't get any points in the center too!
Playing in second line is bigger in a situation like this.]

result: W+18.5

K: the 18 points are almost exactly the size of center territory that white manage to build in the center!
The two crucial mistakes are K15 and the sequence that follows (it is quite clear)
and N3 instad of connecting your bridgehead into W zone of influence.
The rest of the game was quite balanced, your opponent wasn't stronger than you, it was just a matter of chances.
You should try to play safer in the opening. You tend to tenuki too much in the first moves (spying your kgs games too) leaving weak groups that ofter are left on their own, but stronger opponents will easily take advantage of them, attacking!
On the opposite, you can try to tenuki more in the middle game. You often lose track of the global situation to play some local fight.

You have a very good sense of shape, and you can "fix" quickly a group that needs to be protected, that is in your favour.
It seems almost like you play an amashi strategy ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?amashi ), with group left unprotected by purpose, to leave to your opponent the hard choices on how to attack them, while you take all the big points of the opening. You can try it in some game, it is really funny and instructive! (but I wouldn't recomment it as a regular style, it is really hard to use and people will hate you ^^)

It is a sort of "turning" net, where you keep the stone to capture at 2 liberties, and you don't create any potential double-atari in your surrounding stones.
