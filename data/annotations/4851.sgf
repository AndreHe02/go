GC[move10 :  I thought that H16 gives my stones a base and that H17 bigger is than G17

move 6: I wanted to see how he is going to react on that move

move 14: I thought making a base for D11 was more important  than playing C16

move 16: was K 17 too small? purpose of K 17 was to give a base if white is going to play D 17

move 20:  was to avoid  R17

move 22: I expected M16 or M15 I was surprised about  K 18. Maybe K 16 better than K17

move 30: was that right? Closing corner more important?

move 40: I didn't want whit to spread across the lower side

move 42: I don't know why. that is a bad move.

move 52: sente move

move 56: attack white and the next move make sure that white does't jump in

move 62: I knew that I won't be able to make any eyes on the lower side so I thought It is better to make influence in the center

move: 64 avoiding of being cut off the center

move 72: making moyo in the center

move 91: dumb

move 142: avoiding E11

move 206: I wasn't sure but I thought I lost

move 246: forgot it is dead]

AB[pd][dp]C[Review by John Rae 5kyu IGS

White did very well out of the first 25 moves of this game, black missed many chances to attack. Later on black recovered some of the lost ground and then slipped away at the end.

I think in the early stages you were too timid. Handicap stones are to help you attack and pressure the stonger opponent. If you simply defend all the time the adsvantage is eaten away very quickly - as happened in this game.]

(;B[df]C[JR: This seems OK to me];W[dg];B[ef];W[eg]
(;B[gc]TR[df][ef]C[JR: This seems very odd . Black's 2 stones are under  threat. They are also working to make cutting points in white's shape - so they are quite important to keep alive. 

G17 does nothing to help them. This is where things start to go badly wrong in this corner.

The alternatives seems much better.];W[ed]
(;B[ec]C[JR: Simply giving up 2 stones having played them so recently is a waste - equivalent to giving white 2 free moves. More importantly you give white a free eye and make the group pretty much safe.

Still its really the result of the previous move, I'm not keen on the alternative ways of saving these stones now.]
;W[de]
(;B[dl]C[JR:  I understand the feeling that the D11 stone is now too close to white thickness - but the top corner is in danger, it should be protected first.]
;W[nc]
(;B[jc]C[JR: This extension is good becasue it defends the top stones. Its rather a weak pincer on the white stone though.

I think I'd go the other side];W[ne];B[pf];W[qh]
(;B[pb]C[JR: This feels  over-defensive.

In handicap games blacks extra stones are on high ponits giving (potential) influence. Usually white is invadsing in areas where black has more stones - so black's strtategy is to attack these invasions to either develop more strength to attack kill elsewhere or to make territroy while attacking.

Here white is risking a number of separate groups. Black should not think about territroy. the strategy is to split white and attack two groups at once.]

(;B[qe]C[JR: This is giving white a lot of play to undeercut and reduce the black corner to very little.

Consider the alternative];W[re];B[rd];W[oh];B[qm]C[JR : This is the correct move.

Note that compared with the earlier alternative line black is shut into the corner.]
;W[qn];B[pn];W[qo];B[np]C[JR: This is a little aggressive, the  black stones on the side are a little weak]
;W[dc]C[JR:

OK lets stop and think what's going on.

Black has played O4 looking at attacking white in the bottom corner.

White has ingored this and taken sente to cature the corner. This has always been available - white could have done it any time but didn't feel the need.

But it has implications. I black had used a move to defend here it would have saved corner territroy and made the K17 group alive.

Now White has played here the important thing is not losing the corner territory, the important thing is that black's group is not alive. This means black cannot simply ignore things and jump into R3 - (well not without thinking in terms of a large scale exchange.)

Therefore black's objective is to make the group safe AND come out with sente to make his own attack.]

(;B[db]C[JR: this stops white getting so much of the corner but leaves weaknesses to does not get sente.]

(;B[hm]TR[fl][fm]C[JR: 

Here it all depends on what you are hoping to achieve - which in turn depends upon how you see the sratus of groups and the game.

For example capturing the 2 marked stone os not that big for white. Saving them is only important if you want to stop the group getting another eye. OK  D10 makes one eye false BUT at some stage black will have to ensure E11 does not cut off the stones on the side - so white will get a free move to make life. In addition if black protects the 2 marked stones white gets to run into the black moyo and damage the bottom.

The black group above is alive so there is no problem there.

This suggests that black either plays to defend the moyo - G5 as you suggest is one option.

Another option is tenuki. Is there profit to be gained from appraoching the bottom right corner?

Its also quite big to make sure D11 is connected - that makes a big difference in territroy on the side. Without this white does not yet have much territory - I'd go for that]
;W[go];B[hn];W[do];B[cp];W[fp];B[gq];W[ep];B[eq];W[lq]
(;B[lo]C[JR: The black moyo is very open on the upper side and there is still the cut at Q7 - I don't think there is much centre territory to protect.

On the other hand if the white stone has to run it is in the shadow of a big black wall.

Therefore I would block this stone off fhom the corner.

a secondary advantage of this is that it will look under white's stones at jumping into the corner]

G16 seems possible. Black has to be sure what to do if/when white invades at 3-3. 

Are you going to block at D17, which is a bit small I feel or are you going to block at C16, concede the corner and build a big wall to attack the 2 stones below. This feels better to me - if you're not comfortable with it a smaller jump F16 or F17 might suit you better.]
