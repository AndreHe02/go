C[Dear reviewer,

Thank you for taking time to look at my game. I lost by an incredible amount, yet I feel as though I was playing well.

Please help me understand where I went wrong. I played black and lost by
almost 75 points against an opponent 2-3 stones stronger than me.

Hi dogleg.
I've tried to comment the game as thoroughly as I could, answering the questions you put.
Have a look through it, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[ce];W[dp];B[dc]C[Black has given up sente for his shimari in the UL. Not necessarily a bad thing, if he uses this fact later in the game.

The obvious place for white to play is the top side K16 or K4 for a standard opening]
;W[qg];B[mc]C[magic: Both 6 and (especially) 7 are one point further away from the hoshi point than what is 'normal'. Black leaves the corner wide open. Black could also have played e.g. K16, or even a pincer on the right.]
;W[pj]C[White takes the side nicely. Natural points for black are (in order of my preference):
K4, F or O3,  C6];B[jd]C[This stone is really superfluous. Rather, B should let white try to invade the upper side and take profit from attacking him. White will play bottom hoshi or left side, thereby occupying a large amount of side influence points.]
;W[ck]C[Maybe one line further up even.];B[ci]C[magic: Very small. K4 is only point for B (or W)]
;W[jp]C[Last large point.

So, look at the status:

White has strong influence on three sides, black has very strong influence (almost a completed territory) at the top.

To reduce the white lead, black will have to take chances in invading. Furthermore, upper right corner is still not closed.

However, White has no certain territory, but is nicely spread over the goban. If white can manage to use his influence, he will have an easy game.

At this stage,black has already lost the game, unless he can show some spectacular fighting/invading :-)]
;B[fq]C[Better at C6 or (my preference) C7. If white answers at C/D6, then black has actually helped white to solidify his territory.]
;W[eq]LB[fp:A][dn:B][hq:C][jq:D]C[Normal continuation is as marked (black  'A' etc.) Normally, this is good for white because of the white stone at K4, black cannot get a good base. and the 'iron pillar' of K3/4 makes the lower right hand very impressive.]
;B[fr]C[Very early in the game to play on the second line. B helps white to solidify the LL corner]
;W[er];B[jr]C[There are several disadvantages to playing very low stones like this:
- Even if B lives it will be with very few points
- White can build outside influence while walling in B
- Creating a weak group will be a disadvatage for B later

Better play light and skip out towards the middle (F5, leaving san-san open), or play C7]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[iq]C[Better at J2];B[ir]C[Natural cut for black.]
;W[hp]C[White gives B an eye...];B[gq];W[fp]
(;B[jq]C[This just helps W complete his wall];W[ip];B[nq]C[I would have avoided the 25/26 exchange and approached from above instead. See variation.]
;W[lq];B[lr];W[mr];B[kq];W[mq];B[kp];W[gp];B[gs];W[ls];B[kr]
;W[np];B[qq]C[I got this corner invasion wrong.

How should I have played to secure the corner?

magic: see later];W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[rr]
C[Your opponent's vital point is your vital point. If Black had played 45 here at 46, he would have lived.
Now, all black can do is either:
- connect at S3 and hope for the best
- cut at R5 and hope for the best.

See variations.]
(;B[or];W[nr];B[qr];W[rq];B[rs];W[sp];B[ko];W[es]C[? Best saved for later (ko-threats)]
;B[hs];W[dm]C[Nice move taking territory on the left.];B[gc]
LB[ej:A][jj:B]C[This is too much. Black has already used 6 stones for the top, white will not approach the top now.  If black wants to expand his top, he should not play on the third line. Consider 'A'  or even 'B']
;W[pl];B[qe]C[Upper right corner is still open at san-san];W[mn]
;B[jj]C[Nice. But after 58 and 60, less useful.

Notice how white 60/58 made more territory than 57/59...];W[gi]
LB[gg:A][eg:B]C[My opponent's move#62 ends up travelling dramatically into my
territory.

How could I have better contained it?

magic: I think your response was OK. You cannot really expect to do much about it. The upper left is not your territory. In an average game, there are very few points in the middle of the board. Both B and W are out into the middle, so it will be difficult for either to make a large central moyo with many points.

However, your response, trying to cut off W was good. However, you did not continue in the same vein. (See later comment)

In general, there are two ways to avoid a reducing move like 62. Either stop him from connecting and force him to live small (or kill him), or stop his advance. In this case, you could also just have considered simply playing 'A' or 'B']
;B[ej]C[Good];W[gk];B[km]LB[fj:1][gj:2][el:3][gm:4][cl:5]C[Now, B changes his mind. 63 was good, 64 was logical. If B wanted to cut off the white stones, something like the sequence shown may have been playable. (Black 1)
The aim when attacking a group like the white one is not really to kill it, but to build strength so that you can invade or reduce something else.
After 5, White will have to give up an amount of his left territory.

The 65 played only faintly attaches 61 to his bottom group, but is no threat to white.]
;W[jn];B[kn];W[gg];B[eg]C[Good.];W[dj];B[di];W[ek];B[fj]C[Again, good responses]
;W[gj]C[White lost sente this way, and achieved nothing.
Black can now actually cut apart 62 from 68. See variation.]

(;B[fk]C[This only helps white complete his position];W[fl]
;B[fh];W[hl];B[il]C[I don't understand this. Black 77 treatens to cut, white protects another cut, and then black forgets to cut?
If black considers the capture of the white stone at G13 and the surrounding territory small, then OK, but then why play 77?]
;W[im];B[jl];W[fi];B[ei];W[ng]C[Nice move.];B[ml]C[White should not answer this.]
;W[mm];B[nj];W[oi];B[hh];W[gh];B[hg];W[gf];B[ge]C[This really cannot be helped. For every stone white plays, black needs to play two to keep white closed in. Something will give...

Maybe better just making a wall on the right (H14, H15) and use this to make territory on the right later.]
;W[hf];B[jg];W[he];B[gd];W[fg];B[eh]C[Better at F14. F12 is only one stone. F14 closes off the side.]
;W[ef];B[df];W[ee];B[ed];W[de];B[dd];W[id];B[ff]C[I know what I did wrong here. I mis-read it as a snapback.

magic:
That's OK. Better try and learn than not try at all :-)

Ofcourse, playing at F16 straight away (threatening the snap-back) would have kept sente or given you the three stones.]
;W[fe];B[fd]
(;W[ff]C[At least this way you closed off in sente.];B[bj]C[Small play. second and first line plays are best kept for later in the game.]
;W[bk];B[cj]C[Actually, this black group around E11 is probably in danger bacause of the cutting points araound D15]
;W[dk];B[rf]C[Corner is still open.];W[rg];B[ic];W[nl];B[mk]
;W[je];B[kd];W[lg];B[rh]C[Was there any way to make this side invasion succeed?

magic: With the way the stones are now, I don't see it.

Maybe if B had used his stones 87/85/119 to develop something which could actually be used as a basis to attack from/flee towards then maybe]
;W[sg];B[qk];W[qj]C[With the white answer, maybe you had something here. See variation.]

;B[ok];W[pk];B[ol];W[om];B[oj];W[ni];B[ke];W[rd]C[How could I have prevented my opponent from taking the corner?

magic: He should have played san-san, and you would have had no choice. See variation (in two moves) for how you could have killed this one.]

;W[ob];B[nb];W[pb];B[rc];W[qa];B[oa];W[sb];B[na];W[pa]C[159 and 160 can safely be left until the end of the endgame, or as ko-threats.]

(;B[kg];W[lf];B[ki];W[ih];B[ig];W[ks]C[This is, again, best saved for a ko threat.]
;B[js];W[ms]C[And it loses sente...];B[bl]C[I wasn't hopful of success here, but I thought I might have a
chance. Could I have succeeded by playing differently?

His corner doesn't appear to have a complete enclosure.

magic: Hmm.  There is nothing wrong with trying ;-)
Have a look at the variations. I cannot see how Black can expect to live in the corner...

If the theory behind a stone like 187 is that 'once I have a stone inside, it will be easier to make a living group' does not quite apply. As 187 is plastered against the white wall, it has literally no influence. Furthermore, as a stone on the second line, it has no eye-making potential.
And it is too far from the likely invasion  point (C4) to be of any great help.]
;W[ak];B[cp]C[Right place to invade :-)];W[co]C[Right response.

Look at the variations for other ways to die...]
(;B[bp];W[bo];B[cr]C[At best, this leads to a shape with six points in the corner. They are dead.]

C[Dame point.
I can see no points where White can still gain points, but one where he can stop black from making points (marked 'A')]
;B[fs]C[Well seen];W[hk]C[Mandatory connection];C[End result, white wins by comfortable margin.
Notice how little black actually gained from his initial investment in the upper side, compared to how much white got out of his opening.

Both sides made mistakes during the game:
- Black should have been able to live in the bottom right corner.
- White should have been able to disconnect the lower black group from the centre, making a larger centre territory
- The left hand side cut by white was not as dangerous as it seemed

I think most mistakes came about because black was behind in the opening and had to play catch-up in the middle game. If black had had a better opening, then the game would have been more even.

I hope these comments were useful to you.
Good luck !])
