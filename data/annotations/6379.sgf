C[G: Hi there! I'm Gergely form Hungary, I'll mark my comments with G:. 
---

Thank you for reviewing this game.

I played as white in this game and lost by resignation. There are a few moves in the game that I deeply regretted, but more importantly, could you please offer me some advice about my direction of play and the global-board perspective? There are times when I feel that I may have played in the wrong area and ignored groups that I should not have ignored. I would greatly appreciate your input about my play and anything that might help me improve. Thanks again!

[lo:5][qo:B][jp:4][lp:A]C[Just a note, I never really know what to do against the chinese opening, so the game turned out really weird.

G: Just play normal. There is nothing dreadful in chineese opening. It has good reputation but would need firm hand to control.
Black wants the right side. Give it! :) How about sequence 1-5? Or simply play at 'A' in this position. Later invasion is possible at B.]
;W[jd]C[Was this a mistake? Normally, I would have played something like O17 or N4. I regretted this move immediately. I think if I were to play like this, maybe K4 was better than K16, since black is lower on that side of the board.

G: agreed, i would play on the lower side too. I black playing K4 then following R5 shimari would be ideal with dual extension.]
;B[jp];W[dj];B[fq];W[po];B[np];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[This was unexpected. Here's the beginning to what I feel is a huge game-deciding mistake. I thought this move was a mistake so I wanted to punish it, but I did it wrong. Maybe it would've been different if black didn't have R9. I included that variation that I was expecting.

G: I'm not sure it is cleanly bad for black. In this position White primary mission is not to live in the corner but destroying black's moyo. Considering this, R3 might be an overplay. (Im not sure, ask a pro :))]
;W[pp];B[rp]
(;W[qr]TR[qp][rp]C[Since the bottom still looked invadeable, I wanted to capture the two black stones and make a base to attack from. I spent a long time looking at it, but I still misread the situation. Should I have just played P3 instead of R2?

G: Again, white most wanted goal is not to attack the corner but destroying the moyo. If black wants you to play P3 (hurting lower side moyo), do it gladly.]
;B[oq];W[qo];B[rn]C[G: strange];W[ro];B[so];W[rq];B[sp];W[qm]
C[I didn't even consider black's response. I thought that he was going to play R7.


G: R7 is ok. Good forcing move to press down black and helps your heavy stones to escape later.]

(;B[rl]C[Here, I was seriously thinking of resigning. I had no idea what to play here. I believe the only reason I was able to get back into the game was because my opponent continually made mistakes that I was able to take advantage of.

G: I dont think Black S6 would be such a good move that would force white to resign. Consider that you can live in the corner any time (see var).]

(;W[pk]C[I didn't think this would actually work. Unless I'm mistaken, if black had played P8, it would have definately been game over.

G: P8 would have been an overplay here (imho). Building territory and chasing white is the correct behavior.]

(;B[pj];W[ok];B[rj]C[G: seems to be slow. Now white outside group is safe and will glady live in the corner.]
;W[oj];B[cm];W[pi];B[qj]TR[dd][jd][dj]C[Looking back at the game now, I'm not sure why black even responded and if he were going to, why not at R11?


G: well, Black on the right side is not so strong as it looks at first. After T3 black would be in serious trouble. Even if black can live white will get a great outside influence on the right side what is very good considering your 3 white stones.]
;W[rm];B[sm];W[sk];B[sl];W[qg];B[ql];W[qn];B[sn]LB[po:A]C[G: this sequence is aji keshi. Now white cannot take the corner any more.]
;W[pl];B[pr];W[nc];B[pc];W[og];B[em];W[re];B[rc];W[lp]LB[oq:A]
C[Should I have ignored the lower left corner? If so, was this move along the right track? I actually played this move on instinct, not from any reading. I was hoping to use my thickness to make the marked formation uncomfortable, so I could then play something around F4, threatening H3 or J3.

---
G: I wouldnt let the corner die.
'A' is not in danger as long as it has 4 lives, but black can kill the corner with a single move. Making another weak group wont help it much. 

At the other side, if white manage to escape (better for w) or live (ok for w) in the corner, black will be in serious trouble. Black has some territory at the lower side but nothing else and the top right corner is weak White controls everything else.]

(;B[lq];W[mq];B[kq];W[mp]TR[oe]C[G: Its far not good enough in gote! It would have been much better if you simply play P15 to make a *huge* moyo AND threat black's corner.]
;B[cg];W[fp];B[eq];W[ep];B[gp];W[go];B[gq];W[ch]C[Crude/bad move? I was desperate already, hoping to somehow kill or split a part of the potential C7, D7 group and make some territory.


G: "dont touch weak stone". Black wants to live on the left side? Very well then. Build a wall again and control the whole center!

Splitting black groups is essential of course, but black can not connect anyway (d10).]
;B[dh];W[ci];B[ce]
(;W[dg]C[G: That stone is not important. 
1, deffend the corner ( keep black weak)
2, chase black];B[cf];W[eh];B[cc];W[dc];B[cb];W[cd]C[

G: DONT reduce your lives if you cannot kill. This move is gote 1 point for black so he wont play it. In the endgame YOU will get it anyway but in case of fighting that single life can decide EVERYTHING.]
;B[bd];W[db]C[Maybe unnecessary? I didn't have the time to read it through but I thought maybe I could do something in the corner later.

G: if you leave the corner open, any later invasion around f17 would be serious.]

;W[ib];B[jb];W[ee];B[fo]LB[db:A]C[I'm actually surprised that my top left group didn't die. Was it right for black to tenuki here? Should I, as white, have reforced in this bottom corner, around D3 or F6. I didn't play anything because I thought it would be gote.

G: That would have been surprising if you die :) I see a strong white group pressuring weak black here. I hardly think tenuki is correct. Black's upper group will die painly. (And if black tenuki then G7, not cutting.)]
;W[dn];B[en];W[dm];B[dl];W[cn];B[cl];W[el];B[fl];W[ek];B[gn]
;W[ho]C[
G: I wouldnt try to save that stone. Simply kill the upper group (and maybe the corner) and game is won by large margin. If you running here, black will get some stones in the center what can help the fleeing upper group to escape.]

C[Although I lived here somehow, I feel that this was a big mistake on my part. Maybe I should've just given up G5.]
;B[jk];W[hl]C[This was another move played on pure instinct. I didn't have much hope for it accomplishing anything. It just looked like there was a weakness here somewhere.

G: Maybe. however I dont think White has to kill this group. Simply separate the two (top and middle).
One of them will die automagically :-).];B[hk];W[gk];B[gl];W[fk]
;B[il];W[hj];B[ik];W[ii]LB[hc:A]TR[ig]C[Again, the time issue; I didn't really know what to play. I couldn't tell if black's group could live on its own or not. I thought I had a good chance of killing it though, so I wanted to try to prevent it from escaping. I feel that I didn't play the correct moves though. Do you have any insight on the situation?

G: First of all, dont make the center group alive (as you did) The best way of killing to attack multiple groups in the same time. 

Next, consider what sente moves black has (N18) and if these are played, is the group still dead. If it is (and it is) try to occupy best shape position. I would play J13.]
;B[hg];W[id];B[mc];W[nb];B[hd];W[gf];B[ge];W[hf];B[if];W[lb]
;B[ff];W[gg];B[cq]C[I have a feeling that I played this sequence here completely wrong. Maybe I should have just played C4?

G: you can even tenuki. Corner is lost, so not important to play here. But you can massacre the top right and the top middle in exchange (as punishment for black's tenuki).]

(;W[eo]LB[hc:A]C[If I had played B5 instead of this or even if I hadn't, can white still kill black's top group and still win?

G: B5 is not good. In case of semai (life and death fight) shape has no priority. Only lives matter. Simply connect at C5 and White has 4 lives, black has 3. End of fighting.]

[lc][mc][hd][fe][ge][ie][ff][if][hg]C[
G: Well, I dont think its time to resign. 
Despite of white last mistake there is good chanche to win. Consider the following:

* Black can be attacked in sente at 'A' 
* Marked black group is virtualy dead.
* Group 'B' seems to be dead if white plays first here.
* semai in the left side can be won even now (C).
* white has single weak group (D) otherways super strong.
* .. and white's turn now!

Black has only 60 points in territory. If I have to choose here, I would choose white!

**************
General comments:  doing some corner life and death problems would improve your fighting ability. You should kill what is dead and you should live when you can.

Secondly: You should respect center strength much more. In this game you had tremendous power in the center, and you felt you are losing. Actually you dominated your opponent!]
