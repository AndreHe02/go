C[Thanks for reviewing this game. My general questions are:

I often don't know what is the best move -- in the opening and in the middle game.

I
have weakness toward the end of the opening and at the beginning of the
middle game -- I don't know how expand or develop my territories. I
find myself constantly fighting to keep my own space, while the
opponent has happily secured a large chunk of territory by the start of
the middle game.

Thanks.

Ed];B[pp]C[Ed:

My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game for you.  My comments should be prefaced with "Ted:"

I believe the reason you lost is because you didn't attack White in the upper left of the board.  Also, I think you should look more for points to cut your opponent.  You missed a big one toward the end of the game.]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[fc];W[db];B[ic]C[I
 thought this was necessary; otherwise White could play at H17 and
pincer my F17 stone.

Ted:  Extending from the F17 stone is generally the continuation in situations like this.  White does have a threat at G19, but right now that's really too small for either player to worry about.]
;W[fd];B[gd]MA[ep]C[Is this necessary?  Is it better to develop elsewhere, like E4?

Ted: I think maybe you should have played at G17 here.  If you don't respond to White's move at F16, you have to worry that White will play at G17 next.  In any case, a response here is necessary.]
;W[fe];B[ep];W[fb];B[gc];W[ec];B[dq]C[I am told the corner is important, so I head toward it.

Ted:  Well, yes, the corner is important.  But right now, I think you don't need to play a second stone here.  If White plays some sort of extension from the C4 stone next, the corner will develop like some sort of standard joseki.  And joseki are "standard" for a reason -- they generally give roughly equal results to both sides.  After all, professionals wouldn't knowingly play sequences that give them inferior positions!  :-)

I'd look at playing Q10 instead of D3.];W[cq];B[cr]MA[hp][jp]
C[I think I was too concerned about grabbing a piece of the corner.  Probably H4 or K4 is better?

Ted: C2 is premature.  H4 looks like a good idea.  If you play at K4, you'll have to worry about White attacking later on with a move like H4 himself.  This also gives up sente.]
;W[br];B[dr];W[hq]C[I didn't like that he was able to play here.

Ted: When you played at C2, you gave up sente!  That's one of the reasons why C2 wasn't such a good move.]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[lp];W[kq];B[mc]MA[dj][qj]C[Is this too slow? Black is doing OK upper right, is it better to play R10 or D10 ?

Ted: I think that R10 or D10 are both bigger than N17 right now.]
;W[pj];B[qg]MA[dj]C[Looks like Black is too concentrated on the top and to right; something like D10 is better?

Ted: Not only may Black be overconcentrated; White should be able to invade at R17, which will take away a lot of what Black would like to have as territory right now.]
;W[qm];B[qn]C[Ted: This isn't such a good move.  R5 or S5 would be better.]
;W[rn]
(;B[ro]MA[qo]C[Now
that I know he played R5 next, maybe R5 is a better move here?  I
probably played S5 to 'block' him from the corner.

Ted: I think you should have played R5 or S5 a move earlier, instead of R6.  But in this situation, I do believe that R5 is probably better than S5.]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[pn];B[po]MA[dj][go]C[Too small?  He ignored it.  Maybe D10 or somewhere around G5 to harass the H3 group?

Ted: I think it's okay for White to ignore this move.  C10 is big enough that you can sacrifice the S5 stone, too.]
;W[ri];B[qn]C[Ted: You didn't need to play this -- it only gets you one point, and the left side of the board is still much more important!]
;W[pm];B[qo]C[Ted: Oh, dear!  You're still fighting over one lousy point]
;W[rl];B[sn];W[rm];B[kr];W[jr];B[lr];W[iq];B[dn]TR[dq][cr][dr]
SQ[cp][cq][hq][br]C[I was trying to move toward the left but was not sure how.

Ted: A simple move like C10 should help you, although you will likely have to worry about the bottom group eventually, too.

Alternatively, you might want to look at what White did after playing at H2 and how it affected your group.  You might be able to do the same thing to White in the corner.  You don't necessarily need to kill White of course, just make White get a small life while taking more territory on the other side.  Playing further to the left puts pressure on the White group by threatening B1 as well (which serves to take away eyespace from White).]

;W[bn];B[ko];W[lo];B[mo];W[jo];B[ln];W[kn];B[lo];W[jn];B[dk]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[I never know which side is better: Q17 or R16?

Ted: I think Q17 is better here, if you can get sente.  I believe that having a wall facing towards the left, which would combine with the G17 group, is better than having two parallel walls in the Q/R16 area and the Q/R13 area.  Also, the Q/R13 group should make it harder for White to live if he should play a wrong move.]
;W[pc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[sb]
(;B[sc]C[Ted: This move is unnecessary.  So what if White gets to play T17 later?  White would benefit by just one point.  This allows White to play in a way that makes it easier to secure the corner.  I think I'd play P17 right now.  In a situation like this, the object isn't to deny your opponent liberties, but to play on the points where your opponent would want to play in order to make eyes.]
;W[qa]C[Ted: Which is precisely what White does here!];B[oc]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb];W[nh];B[od]C[I thought it was important to keep all the white stones cut off at the corner.

Ted:  The White stones in the corner are cut off right now.  I think it's better to play at O13 now.  Also, if White were to cut at P16, Black can still capture the stone in a ladder.]
;W[mf];B[na];W[pa];B[ke]C[I don't know how to play the early middle game, so I play stones "slowly" toward the center.]
;W[ml];B[mm]C[Ted: I don't think this move is necessary at all.  White can't benefit much from playing here or at M7 next move.  I think I'd try to go toward the center from the group in the bottom left (ie, by playing a move like F8), or possibly by jumping from L15 to L13.  The latter, however, may allow White to cause problems by trying to cut at L14.

In the area where you played, M7 might be better for Black.]
;W[ll];B[ng]MA[cg][dh]C[Is D12 or C13 possible invasions?

Ted: I believe either is possible.  The worst that can happen in a situation like this is that you learn where *not* to invade.  :-)

More seriously, I believe that you have a good chance to get one eye along the side, with the opportunity to run out into the center, either making a second eye in the center or connecting to D9 or L15.  Plus, there may be some aji in attacking the weak stone at C10 you can use to help to get an eye.]
;W[og];B[of];W[mg];B[oh];W[oi];B[og];W[lh];B[kg]C[My attempt to "throw more stones in the middle".]
