AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I felt pretty good about how I played this game, but that probably just means I'm not understanding well enough what I did wrong. There are a few moves which look too over concentrated or a bit off or whatever, but I'm not sure where my major mistakes are.

Hi my name is Jay, and I will be reviewing your game.  My comments will start with  "J:"]

Quacktapus [4k\]: hi gg];B[nc];W[qn];B[qi]C[This seemed weird while I was playing it, but I really wanted to avoid b O3 w Q10 or something like that, where w grabs the whole right side in three moves. If that's my goal, is there somewhere better to put move 4? Or should I let w try taking the right side and use sente to grab another star point?

J: both ways are valid.  I prefer the R11 move (or some other move in this area) because it keeps white split.  Getting into fights is the way to improve in a handicap game.]
;W[np]
(;B[oo]MA[no][pn]C[J: while keeping white split is a good idea, P5 is a bit slack.  I'd consider a tighter move at either O5 or Q6.  See variations.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[I know that given where moves 3 and 5 are I should normally play move 8 on the other side at Q3, but I was worried that I would be weakening move 4 by putting a strong white group in the lower right... I was trying to turn move 4 into an extension from a wall. Is this trying to hard? is it not worth it to let w make a group on the fourth line?

J: this is a sub-optimal position steeming from P5, but R4 is a little painful to play.  Splitting the other is probably better. See variation.]
;W[pq];B[no]MA[pm]C[J: Here, black at Q7 instead would eat R6 and for a more stable position.  O5 is pushing from behind, remember that R6 can stabilize with R9.]
;W[op];B[po];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn]MA[ql]C[J: S6 would be better at R8, while it's true that white can still connect, under, points-wise, it's pretty small compared to the aji still left in the R6 stone.]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[mp];B[ln];W[mo];B[mn];W[nm];B[om]MA[mk][rl]C[As you'll see, I gave up on this move quickly. Am I right that it's a mistake?

J: aim bigger, maybe a move at N9 instead? S6 can still connect to R11.]
;W[ol]
(;B[nn]MA[pm]C[J: Can start a fight with Q7 instead.  See variation.]
;W[pm];B[oi]C[Should this move have been an extension from my (still weak) wall to M9 or something instead?]
;W[on];B[pk]MA[lk]C[I was trying to prevent eye space and keep the white group weak. But it looks over concentrated... is there somewhere better?

J: right now, the key focus should be the S5 and R6 groups, so capping at M9 would be goo for black.  This ensures that white needs to live small on the right side, runs the S5 group, and starts building up the middle.]
;W[rk];B[qk];W[rm];B[rj];W[ll]C[J: instead, white takes the key area.]
;B[jn];W[ko];B[kn];W[jl];B[ip];W[fq];B[fo]C[This looked weird too... I was trying to help make my running wall safer while attacking the single white stone. Where else could I play?]
;W[jq];B[dq]C[The idea was to force w to play at J3 or something to save the stone at F3, letting me play H8 or so and get back to attacking the center w group. It... sort of worked?

J: black at J3 to threaten F3 might be better.  Your aim should be to attack a group, it should be attack a group to gain something. It's difficult to see what could be gained from puching K8 around.]
;W[jo];B[in];W[io];B[hn];W[ho];B[go]C[J: white's bottom is pretty big.]
;W[dj];B[dl];W[cf];B[ee]C[again: is this too weird? I think  I was just trying to be as aggressive as possible because w still didn't have a settled group anywhere except the lower side. Other options?

J: I think this is a fine move.];W[el];B[hl]C[J: wrong timing, saving D8 is urgent.]
;W[dm];B[lj];W[kk];B[ji];W[ij];B[ii];W[hj];B[qe]C[Looking back, this should probably have been one higher to keep the corner and the right, and probably should have been in the upper side to not be so slow...

J: agreed.];W[qc];B[qd];W[ic]
(;B[kc]C[J: pushing the other way can strengthen your right corner.  See variation.]
;W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[eb];W[md];B[ke]MA[kd]C[J: good fighting spirit, but in this case, responding is ok too.  The top rigth corner would be safe.  Also consider L16.]

;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ca];W[ce];B[dc];W[dg];B[cn]C[And the rest is (I think) mostly uneventful endgame.

J: I think the take away from this game is just improving your reading.  Doing go problems really helps this.  Also, some up with a plan before a sequence of moves to direct the direction of play to your advantage, like between R5 and R6 groups and D16 and J17.
