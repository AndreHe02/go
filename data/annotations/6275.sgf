C[C;  Hi, I'm Charlie and my strength is around 9k on IGS. I'll mark my comments with a C so you'll know it's me. Before I start, I'll just say that I'm not exactly a master myself, so take my advice with a grain of salt. I'll point out what I can, but if anything is still unclear to you, feel free to email me back or something for a clearer explanation.

Hi, im playing white in this game and i lose it by around 100 points at the end. So, im really poor, please help me! Thank you very much.

P.S. Sorry my english is like my Go -- poor.];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd]
;W[dq];B[qn]
(;W[nq]C[C:  This move is too low. Because you have a stone on D2, the correct move in this direction is O4. You can also think about a pincer, or play a shimari at C5. See variations for some possible outcomes.]
;B[qq];W[qp]C[C:  No, your move is fine. R3 is greedy for black.

Here, i try to separate his stones, but maybe its a bad idea?]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo]
(;B[rn]
(;W[pq]C[C:  Q3 seems a bit odd. You said earlier you wanted to seperate his stones, but now black plays T5 and easily connects. White must play T5 here and attack black's seperated groups.]
;B[so]
(;W[jp]C[C:  K3 is a bit slow. Your group in the lower right is very safe, plus D3 and O3 are both low, so the bottom side is uninteresting. C14 seems good here, playing into a standard opening position.]
;B[pj]
(;W[dk]C[C:  You're playing a bit too conservatively here. A play on the left side should be the kakari at C14. If you want to play on the top, the correct move is K17, not K16, as you should create a base on the third line when playing on the star between D16 and Q16.

I was thinking about K16 too..];B[jd];W[cf]C[C:  Good!];B[pn]
C[C:  A mistake for black, this is much too slow.]
(;W[nn]C[C:  You're trying to create the moyo on the bottom, but it is not urgent to answer Q6 with the immediate cap. Even if black plays O6 next, your position on bottom is still safe, and black's right side is very easy to invade right now, considering all his stones on the fourth line.

Hm..];B[co]C[C:  This move seems too risky for black, as you already have a stone on D9.]

(;W[cn]C[C:  This is an overplay. Attaching on the other side is better.]
;B[cq];W[bo];B[bp]
(;W[ao]C[C:  The kikashi at D5 should come first.];B[do]C[C:  Now black plays D5 and D3 is weak.]

(;W[eo]C[C:  Overplay! D3 is weak, you must defend before going after black's group.]
;B[dn];W[dm]C[C:  A mistake, black has a tesuji at B6 ot capture your stones.]

(;B[ap]C[C:  Black misses the opportunity.]
(;W[cm]C[C:  Should've been played instead of D7, but now C7 is needed to cover the weakness.]
;B[bn];W[dp]C[C:  Good! This kikashi's effective is less because black's group is completely alive, but it still defends your D3 group in sente.]
;B[en]C[C:  C4 is better for black...];W[fo];B[fn]
(;W[go]C[C:  C4 might be better here, I think your group is safe.]
;B[hm]
(;W[jm]C[C:  This move is not needed, as black's group is already alive. Tenuki on the top or right side is the biggest priority now.]
;B[jj]C[C:  Black does not know how to make the moyo.];W[il]
C[C:  Again, black's group cannot be attacked.];B[hl];W[hk]
;B[ik];W[jk];B[ij];W[gk];B[kk];W[jl];B[kl];W[lm];B[nm];W[mm]
;B[nl];W[on];B[om]C[C:  You must notice that the exchange of moves you just made strengthened black's center immensely, now invading the top right is much harder. You solidified your bottom, but black's moyo in the top right is much, much bigger and should've been your target earlier. The sequence you just played should be reserved for endgame. An exchange of some bottom territory for a group is top right would be favorable for white.]
;W[gn];B[gm]
(;W[gi]C[C:  It was possible to cut black's three stones here.]
;B[hh];W[in]C[C:  No, it's not over. This move at F7 would make a big difference to start, and although fighting in the center strengthened black quite a bit, there are still opportunities for invasion. San-san at R17 is an option, for starters. However, you must get out of your defensive mentality and start playing more aggressively.

Was it over already?];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[ep];B[bl]C[C:  A mistake by black.]

(;W[bj]C[C:  This move at B7 cuts the stone. Again, you should look for weaknesses instead of playing a passive, defensive move.]
;B[ck];W[cj];B[eg]
(;W[bd]C[C:  F17 was always an option, and still is. Because black did not play a direct response to C14, B16 is a bit passive, as it assumes a black stone at F17 or F16. See variation.]
;B[cc];W[bc]C[C:  B17 is too slow. You are behind, so you must play actively. A move in the top right should be urgent, Kakari, invasion at san-san, or attachment at the 4-3 point are all options.]
;B[cb];W[de];B[ee];W[ef];B[fd]C[C:  This is a strange move by black.]
;W[ff];B[hf];W[gh];B[gg];W[fg];B[ce];W[be];B[df]
(;W[cg]C[C:  Why not D13?];B[dg];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[fh];W[fi]
;B[de];W[di];B[hi];W[hj]C[C:  Again, a much too passive move. The top right is still open.]
;B[ml];W[ll];B[lk];W[km];B[mj]
(;W[qf]C[C:  Much too late. It seems you played this as an afterthought after seeing you're down a lot of points. This was a very good move earlier.]
;B[qe]
(;W[re]C[C:  Q14 is the correct move here, it allows you to either take the right side or the corner.]
;B[rd];W[rg];B[pf];W[pg];B[og]
(;W[pi]C[C:  Q12 is the correct shape.];B[ph]
(;W[oh]C[C:  You cannot cut like this during invasions, focus on establishing a base. Imagine having played Q12 instead of Q11, your position would be fine then.]
;B[qg];W[rf]C[C:  Now the white group has no way of living.]
;B[rh];W[bb];B[ba];W[aa]C[C:  This move is not necessary. Big moves at F7 especially, as well as, R2 and D1.]
;B[ca];W[ab];B[fl]C[C:  Black finally defends this weakness.]
;W[ek]C[C:  R2 or D1];B[el];W[dl];B[bk];W[cp]C[C:  Killing is impossible, black's group is completely connected because he can take the B5 group at anytime in only one move.

Here, im trying to kill his D6 group for collect some points, but i dont got it.]
;B[an];W[gl];B[fk];W[gj];B[bm];W[ak];B[al];W[bo];B[ao];W[em]
;B[bq]C[C:  Big mistake!];W[ar]C[C:  Must be played at F7!]
;B[gf];W[fm]C[C:  Yes!];B[bo];W[bs]C[C:  Black already as an eye at A7, so it is alive.]
;B[fe]C[C:  Black takes away a point from himself with this move by filling in his own territory.]
;W[cs]C[C:  Should be at D1, the plan to kill is hopeless.]
;B[ds];W[cl];B[es]
(;W[fs]C[C:  G2 the only way to stop this.];B[fr];W[gr];B[gs]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[hs];B[gq];W[er];B[hr];W[aq];B[eq]C[C:  As a recap of the game, the biggest thing here is that you waited far too long to deal with the top right. By the time he has the wall in the center, it is too late. Try not to play too many moves in one area of the board unless it is urgent. By that, I mean moves that threaten life. If a group is safe, it is usually better to play a big move somewhere else rather than extending from the group and only getting 2-3 points at a time. Also, in your local battles, try to think of how playing in that area will affect the rest of the board. One big result of your fight in the center was the wall facing the top right, which ended up as a huge chunk of black territory. You missed some tesujis, but seeing those just takes a bit more familiarity with positions. Try to take advantage of your opponents mistakes if you think he made one.

Feel free to ask me if you have any questions, and good luck in your future games!]
