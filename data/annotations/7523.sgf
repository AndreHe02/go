C[I am Hawk on KGS.  This game is close, but I couldn't break into the center to reduce his obviously large moyo.

My first comment is on move 28.  But there are not many comments because I played what I considered a good game.

Thanks in advance.
Mike

Hello Mike, i am queenofgo in KGS. My rank is around 3-4 k.
It looks like both side didn't make much effort on the opening. Since it was a ten minute game, it's 
normal. But i think you should consider working on your opening strategy. I think your mistake was 
to let black what he wants in the begining. Then, normally, you couldn't get into his moyo in the center.
My comments will begin with "Q".];B[pd];W[dp]C[rasmojah [10k\]: salut ;o)

Q: To play tengen this early in the game is not usual. Because star points stones are ideal for develop along sides rather than the center. I think your answer is not bad]

Q: In my poinion, this is not the area that white should play now. It's not a good move for black neither, because even if black takes this area, there is a gap around r12. I would play a move around k4 for activate lower side or play on the upper side in order to keep white away from making a big moyo.]

Q: Again this side is not interesting. You are not attacking black nor making enough territory, take a big point on the upper side or play to left side is more urgent.]
;B[dj];W[jc]C[I am concerned about this large area.  I live in here but don't get many points.

Q: This is a good idea . You should play it maybe a bit earlier, but it's still very open.
I am not sure about the right move here, but K17 didn't seem the right one to me.]
