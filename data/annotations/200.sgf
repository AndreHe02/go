Pls see Var 2., which is Joseki.]

(;W[dg];B[cg];W[de];B[ef];W[cd];B[ee];W[ce]L[eh]C['a' is weak.

I will hope for the sequence 'a' to 'e'.];W[ph]C[Outrageous  move.];B[og]
;W[od];B[pc];W[pe];B[qe];W[oe];B[qf];W[oh]C[Bad  move.];B[ng];W[mf]L[nh]
C['a' is a little awkward.

How about Var 2?]
(;B[nh];W[oi]L[kf][lg][kg][lh][ni][pl]C[Black can still get the  rhythmn  from 'a' to 'f', but not as good as previous variation.]

White 'a' a must.];B[ol]C[You missed a chance here.];W[kf]L[le][lf]

'a' much  better.];W[lf];B[lj];W[nl];B[om];W[nm];B[on];W[qn];B[nn];W[qk]
;B[qj];W[pl]L[ok]C[Can White cut at 'a'?];B[pk]L[ok]C[The answer is no, just  imagine there is stone at 'a' now.

So, Black should Tenuki (play somewhere else).];W[ql];B[qh]L[pg][of]
[lm]C[Wrong concept.

Pls imagine the exchange of White 'a' and Black 'b'.

Will you still play this move?

You should play 'c' instead, White will has a hard  time.];W[qi];B[ri];W
[qg];B[rh];W[pg]L[rg][of][lm]C['a' is a  mistake.

You should play 'b', if White dares to play 'a' then you play  'c'.];B[rg]
M[og][ng][nh][lg][lh][lj]C[Losing move of this game.

The marked stones cannot be sacrifice because they serve to disconnect  White's  2 big groups.

Next time, just imagine the marked stones are 50  points.];W[of]C[Game is over.]
