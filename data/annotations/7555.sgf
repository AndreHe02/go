C[This is a game from an online tournament with a lot of fighting. After the game we both had the feeling that the complexity of the game was well above our head, so we both feel like we could learn a lot from it.

Thank you very much!

*Note: Hi, my name is Huang and I'll be your reviewer. I also go by goforbroke on IGS. My comments will be indicated by "*Note:". Thank you for the opportunity to review your game and I hope you find my comments helpful! :)]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[fc];W[df];B[jd]C[*Note: Looks like black is electing for a speedy opening.]
;W[qj];B[co]
(;W[ep]LB[cj:A]C[*Note: The kosumi is steady but in terms of white's aim and the result, it seems unfavorable. When white plays W12 later at A, white does not gain much. If the plan is to play around A, it's probably better just to pincer right away.]
;B[dm];W[cj]LB[ck:A][df:B]C[*Note: This move doesn't seem optimal. For a stronger attack, the joseki is to play at A. In terms of territory, its distance from B leaves white too thin, plus the top left corner is still open for black to invade.]
;B[cq];W[cr]
(;B[cp]LB[bm:A]C[*Note: This move seems a bit heavy in my opinion. White can still reduce with a large keima at A and solidly connecting here doesn't offer much potential to make eyes.]
;W[iq]LB[cj:A][ip:B][jp:C][kp:D][fm:E]C[*Note: Playing on the third line here seems to indicate along with A that white is playing for territory. I think playing around B, C, or even D is more positive. Doing so leaves open a play around D allowing white to take advantage of black's heavy group on the lower left side by attacking it and projecting some center influence.]
;B[qm]LB[br:A][fm:B][gp:C][ej:D]C[Black: Is it okay to leave the C5 group undefended like this?

*Note: In my opinion, the C5 group should be reinforced. Simply playing at A  or even better around B which gives C or D as miai. White should seek to take advantage of black's heavy group on the lower left though throughout the game it seems the focus has been elsewhere.]
;W[qg];B[og]C[*Note: This cap is good. Black is playing on a big scale.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[pj];B[qi]C[*Note: This looks painful for white. The Q10 group has become heavy and now a burden since the group is split and baseless. Black can aim to attack it and expand the top moyo.]
;W[qc];B[pc]LB[jd:A]C[Black: Here I was very unsure about the side on which to respond. Build a large moyo on top or eat R13?

*Note: This direction looks correct. Eating R13 gains minimal points and would ruin the potential of A.]
;W[qd]
(;B[fe]LB[qe:A]C[*Note: Playing on the right side around A is more urgent.]

;W[qf]LB[qh:A][ri:B][ql:C]C[*Note: Better for white to play at A. If black connects at B, white can easily cover at C.]

;B[nl]C[Black: Better to capture P4 here, sacrificing P9?

*Note: I think it is better to capture P4. The P9 group even with one more move by white is not guaranteed to die and if white plays there you can wait for an opportunity to escape or use the P9 group's aji and take sente for the time being as the top left is still big for both sides to play.]

[lk:B][ll:C]C[Black: Any better response but eating Q12? Probably save Q9 instead?

Note: Since black's intention at turning at A is to not end up sacrificing the group, I would play around B or C instead threatening one of the 2 marked white groups.]
;W[mm]C[*Note: If not for what follows in the lower right, this seems like too much for black to lose.

Prior to this, white seems to have overplayed and black looked very favorable.]
;B[pr];W[qr];B[or];W[om];B[qs]CR[rs]C[Here we already figured out that white could have gotten a ko.

*Note: White can win the race by playing on the circled spot, please see the variation.]
(;W[sr];B[rs];W[rn];B[sp];W[rg]C[*Note: White is behind, at this juncture, this move seems too slow. White needs to take risks and start attacking black's lower left group or find a way to invade the top.]

[bj][aj][cd][bd][ad][de][dg][di][bq][aq][cm][bm][am][mk]C[*Note: If white were ahead, simply blocking for territory is sufficient, but taking the initiative should be priority and not blindly answering black.

Let's take a very rough count here. At best white roughly has 50 points not including komi. Black has roughly 65 points with not many weaknesses, whereas white is still thin in multiple areas.]
;B[fm]C[Black: I was very unsure about this, seemed like a strategic decision. Any better move?

*Note: A move to reinforce the bottom left is necessary. White is losing opportunities to exploit weaknesses in black's lower left group.]
;W[jh]LB[jg:A]C[*Note: White is finally starting to take initiative, however, white seems ok to go one line deeper at A.]
;B[cc]C[*Note: Huge for both sides.];W[cd];B[dc];W[gf];B[ge]
LB[ff:A][nd:B][ke:C]C[Black: Better to connect at F14?

*Note: This block does not seem bad but white should not answer by cutting at A, peeping at B or playing around C seems urgent.]
;W[ff];B[jf]C[*Note: Letting black easily play here is too passive for white.]
;W[hf];B[he];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[lp];B[kp]C[Black: Better to play M3?

*Note: Black is ahead so taking risks is not advisable. If white aims to attack both the L3 black group and the lower left black group connecting here is giving white an opportunity to cause chaos and the possibility to win.]
;W[lq];B[km];W[im]C[*Note: What follows looks like an intense fight. This is in white's favor though because white is already behind. Black should not give white an opportunity to win.]

Thank you very much for your effort!])

This is my last comment, I hope the review has been helpful!]

Also it leaves white to possibly play A to threaten B later if black's O2 group comes under attack.

Obviously this would have changed the game.])))
