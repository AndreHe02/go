C[Dear reviewer!

I played black in this game. I made much territory in the beginning but some time i got panicked by the white influence in the center.

Hubert :It's a normal exchange. It lusually lead to violent fighting.

 Than i try to counter the influence, but this did not work and some life&death-problems

JHubert :Again, it's usual

 occured that i did not solved. What can i do better? 

Hubert : Let's see

Thanks for any comments.];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fc];W[df]
;B[jd];W[jp];B[cn];W[cj];B[cq];W[cp]C[wrong direction?

Hubert : I think this move is Ok.
The other direction make things too easy for black : A big corner against imperfect wall in sente.
With this move, white cut C7 off, making a huge moyo in the center.]
;B[dq];W[eq]C[should at e4?

Hubert : This white move is VERY BAD. E4 is the ONLY MOVE.]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[dn];B[fq]C[i am happy so far.

Hubert : Very Happy. Big corner and access to the center K4 is weak.]
;W[po];B[nq]C[better at o4?

Hubert : O4 further degrade K4. But O3 is Ok.
Slow and solid in this area is good enough.];W[pl]
(;B[qp]C[to early? better around q10?

Hubert : POOR SHAPE & wrong direction.
Never play such a shape again, lear about R5.

1.
Locally, the move is R5 to take a big corner and make white somewhat overconcentrated.

White cannot easily counterattack because of N3.

See var to understand what will happen after R5.

This is locally very good for black BUT white keep sente to play in the upper right corner.

2. Globally, it is better for black to make a moyo at Q11.  But R5 is good enough.

See second var to see what will happen.];W[no]C[Hubert : I would have tenuki here. White is light. No need to add a stone and make a heavy group.]
;B[lp]C[Hubert : This move is GOOD.];W[gn]
(;B[cl]C[maybe leave this aji for later? maybe better at f10 to reduce whites mojo?

Hubert : PURE JALOUSY ( BAD MOVE)
Don't play INSIDE white territory.

F10 would have been PROPER SHAPE here.


BUT :

THE TURNING POINT HERE IS G6-K4

If white play first here (at K6) his influence will be tremendous.

YOU MUST PLAY J5 TO SEPARATE K4 FROM G6.

SEE VAR];W[ej];B[ch]C[Hubert : B12 is better or simply F12]
;W[dh]C[Hubert : So bad. D11 instead keeps black separated.

With his next moves, white let black connect and live very easily.]
;B[bj];W[ck];B[bk];W[dl];B[bm];W[ci];B[bo]C[Hubert ; Nor neceaasry : you weaken the corner very much.]
;W[ap];B[bi]C[Hubert : Whiete lose everything here. He had better to learn how to play against such invasion.]
;W[cg];B[al]C[Hubert : B12 is bery big.];W[hd];B[pj]C[Hubert : You must respond but this move is not so bad.]
;W[oj];B[pk]C[Hubert : TERRIBLE SHAPE

This move is dame-tsumari (you diminish your liberties)

P11 is THE ONLY MOVE  (or sometimes P9 is you feel tricky.)]
;W[ok];B[ql];W[oh];B[pm];W[ol];B[qn];W[ko]C[Hubert :
Black is very low on the right.  After the disater on the left, white is coming back on the right.]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mn];W[lm];B[nn]C[this 2 stones clearly are to small to capture.

Hubert : YEEEEESSSSS

L14 would have been correct.];W[od];B[oe];W[pd]C[Hubert : White copy your POOR SHAPE. FUNNY.
O15 is so evident !];B[pe];W[qc];B[rd];W[md];B[rc];W[ne];B[ml]
C[now i got panicked about the big white center.

Hubert : Just play H17 to make a base at the top. It's difficult to prohibit your access in the center there.]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[nl];B[og];W[nh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg]C[Hubert : Black will die in the center.]
;B[mi];W[pi]C[Hubert : White is VERY GREEDY. N9 is sure and clear.]
;B[ji];W[jg];B[mk]C[Hubert : White should live on the right, but black has his chance.]

See var.];B[rj];W[ri];B[qj];W[sj];B[rl];W[rg]
(;B[rf]C[better at q10 to live? is white dead? (see variations)

Hubert : Yes, white is dead here. But before killing, black must live IN SENTE in the corner. Of course that's not possible.  Soi white is alive in fact.]
;W[sf];B[re]C[Hubert : Playing Ko here is good for black. You have ko material in the center.]
;W[qb];B[pf]C[Hubert : Not necessary : You lose a liberty, you gain nothing. Bad habit.]

Hubert : The stones in the center could die. So, this seki could finish in black annihilation.]

(;W[hc]C[Hubert :  White has just to kill the stones in the center.
Because to kill seems too greedy, white can surrround black center THEN attack these stones.

 See var.];B[db]C[Hubert : The usual idea is to play D17 and sacrifice G17 to get a big corner. This move is very dangerous.]
;W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[dc];W[cd];B[ed];W[gb];B[ff]C[any way to live with this group?

Hubert : I don't think so

F18 destry white eyes

So no hope to live here.];W[ee];B[fe];W[hg]C[Hubert : Beware. Now a move at M10 could kill black center]
