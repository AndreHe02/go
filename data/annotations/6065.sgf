C[jamesuwe [7k\]: hi
Dear Reviewer,I lost this game by 65 points,made some big mistakes and many little ones.so i would thank you very much for really correcting all or as many as you can of them!Ive already added some comments

review by Ba_alza(2k)];B[dp]
(;W[pp]C[Kandalf [8k\]: hi];B[cd]
(;W[pd];B[fd]LB[cj:B][dj:A]C[i play this opening often(also like in the variations).is it okay or has it bigger weaknesses?

i never played this opening and cannot tell you for sure if it is ok although i think it is. It has no obvious weakness i can see right now. if i were white, i would play somewhere at A or B next.

Personally i like to play the other direction in the second corner, that is D17 instead of C16. I think this version corresponds better to the stone in the lower left corner.]
;W[jq];B[dj]C[nice black moyo];W[dc]C[this comes too early. White is scared by blacks moyo but to jump in here is a grave mistake. If black played right, he should be able to shut white in and become very strong.]
;B[dd];W[ec];B[fc]C[is this answer against the invasion ok?are there other,better variations?

i would have played the same way];W[cc]
(;B[jd]LB[ed:A]C[this is the move that cost you much! it is absolutely necessary to play at A here. (see variation) White needs another move afterwards and you get a nice wall in both directions. K16 is not urgent here.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ed];B[de];W[ee];B[df];W[bb]C[i played like this to get territorry on the left side,at the price of getting a cut through my 2 groups. would there have been a good possibility to avoid the cut?

the cut should have been avoided beforehand, i dont think it is possible here anymore. This cut really hurts.]
;B[fe]C[E13 seems to better, builds moyo on the left side];W[ef]

(;B[dh]TR[cd][dd][de][df]C[as you have seen, the marked shape is bad. So better just play D13 here...]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[eg];B[dl]C[the first severe mistake i can make out in my playing until now.I totally ignored the weakness at C14.]
;W[cf];B[ce];W[bf];B[bg];W[ae];B[ci];W[dn]LB[pj:A]C[this invasion is again too early. The big point A is still open.]

(;B[eo];W[cm];B[cl]C[was the atacking good so far or should i have done it differently?

the attacking is fine, another possibility is just to defend at F3]
;W[bp]C[too far];B[co]C[any other atacking possibilities than this move?

white jumped too far, this is the right way to punish that. Cuts are (nearly) always good :)]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr];B[er];W[dm];B[bl]
;W[do];B[cp];W[ep];B[eq];W[br]
(;B[em];W[fp];B[fo]LB[nc:B][qj:A]C[this move is not necessary as all your stones are connected anyway. Again, the big point at A, perhaps B would be better.]
;W[gq];B[ho]C[probably a bad move.before playing this move i considered the play at O17,because ofthe support of myF16 group,but theni played here to avoid white getting a wall atG,G4,G5.

yes, this move seems too small.];W[mc];B[kc];W[lb];B[mp]SQ[gq]
[jq]C[thought i should invade now and hoped that white would take territorry at the lower side and i could get a strong wall to get a big moyo in the middle.the invasion became an entire disaster.please show me better way i could have played!

If you want to attack the marked white group, this move seems fine. I dont think you can expect to gain moyo in the middle though.]

(;W[pm]C[risky play by white]
(;B[jo];W[lq]
(;B[mq]C[i think instead of this one i should have played at M5 to connect

I think this one is fine. Keeps the attack on white's group going]

;W[ml];B[po];W[qo];B[pn];W[qn];B[om];W[pl];B[oq]C[can white kill?

i dont think so, you are alive now! In my book, the invasion is fine so far if you can kill the group at K3.]
;W[pr];B[or];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr]
(;B[np]C[this move does nothing, your group already lives];W[ko]
;B[kn]C[the situation is settled, you gain nothing by this move. Better to play on the right side.]
;W[ln];B[km];W[jp];B[ip];W[iq];B[gp];W[fq];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp]
;W[fr];B[en];W[es];B[eh]LB[ph:B][qh:A]C[still better to play on the right side i think, such as A or B.]
;W[fg];B[fh]C[i was lucky to have a bit in the middle,because i had no other territorry on the fieldand all four corners lost!!i reckon i have already lost the game at this state

as all white groups are alive, i would say too you are somewhat behind!]
;W[hb]C[how should i answer this invasion?

this invasion really hurts, there is no good answer. And trying to build moyo by running at F12 has separated your two groups even more. your only hope to save this group is to run.]

(;B[gb]
(;W[kb];B[jb];W[ic];B[jc];W[he]C[white made a mistake here by chosing this jump (see variations)]

(;B[jf];W[ib];B[hg];W[gf];B[kk];W[ii]LB[kh:A]C[is this deep invasion possible?(if you dont make the foolish mistakes i did)

this invasion is way too deep. A seems resonable.];B[ki];W[gg]

(;B[pc];W[gn];B[go];W[qc];B[oc];W[ja];B[od]C[i think white was quite kind to me,could he have atacked me harder?

possibly he could have succeeded in shutting you in with P16 instead, but black is alive anyway.]

(;B[md];W[qd];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[se];B[qk]C[is this one possible.(i played it extremely near to whites thickness)

Kandalf [8k\]: thx

I would recommend doing a few life and death problems as well. Perhaps it will help you if you sometimes take a close look at the board during the game and ponder about the most urgent move.

I hope this review will be of some help for you. If you have any comments, feel free to contact me, as this was the first review i did for GTL.]
