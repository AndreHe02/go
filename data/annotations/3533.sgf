C[White is a Chinese dan player. He guesses that he's chinese 1d, but club estimates put him at about 4d AGA. I'm about 2d AGA (taking black) and trying to get back in the groove and improve a lot after taking some months off.

This game is one big fight after another. I missed a couple key points, but it was fun nonetheless. I think it was pretty complicated, so even though we went over the game for an hour or two afterwards, I feel like I missed some really basic things, especially in the first couple of moves.

There's really no fuseki to speak of, so I guess I'm hoping for some pointers for fighting in good shape. Thanks for your comments.

[EV\] I can point out a few fuseki problems and a few mistakes in fighting, but you are right, this game has lots of complicated fighting!  Reviewer comments will be preceded by [EV\].   Eric Vella (AGA 5D)]
;B[qd];W[od];B[pp]C[Should I respond in upper right corner?

[EV\] Either choice is fine.];W[qe];B[re];W[qf];B[rf]C[[EV\] See the following variation for a common joseki, to serve as a reference for later comments.]

(;W[qh];B[pe]C[Is there a better shape to play at this move? Perhaps r13 or q16?

[EV\] W last move was not joseki, so it is worth considering whether B has some way to punish it, but I do not see anything dramatic.  Your move is the most direct try, but the resulting fight seems better for W.  R13 also looks like a good try, but again leads to a difficult fight.  Q16 could continue as in the standard joseki (previous variation), leaving W with a slightly different weakness at the end, so that would certainly be playable for B.]
;W[pf];B[pd];W[oe];B[of]C[Too early maybe? Perhaps p17 instead?

[EV\] The resulting fight seems easier for W, but switching to P17 now would make the Q15-Q14 exchange bad (aji-keshi).]
;W[oc]C[[EV\] W gets the vital point.  I do not see any good continuation for B.]
;B[rg]C[Is this better than playing into the corner?

[EV\] This move seems necessary.  Living in the corner without this move is very small, and it would certainly be bad to let W get this move in sente.]
;W[nf];B[og];W[ph];B[rh]C[I'm trying not to get sealed in, but crawling seems bad.

[EV\] At this point, I think it would be better to just live in the corner (Q18).  Running along the second line is too small and weakens your cutting stones too much.]
;W[rc]C[[EV\] This move is tempting for W, but R10 would be simpler and also good.  In comparison to the reference joseki, W would be clearly superior.]
;B[rd];W[qb];B[qj]C[i felt relieved white let me play here, instead of making me live in the corner

[EV\] Yes, the B cutting stones have much more aji now.  Since W is a bit short on liberties, how about R11 instead of R10?  If w pushes, you could double-hane and get to the fourth line earlier, compared to the actual game.  W has too few liberties to cut and fight.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[qi];W[pi];B[pl];W[ol];B[ng]C[too early?

[EV\] I would never give W the atari Q7 in sente, but that may just be a matter of style.  This seems like a possible fighting move.]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[mf];B[ni];W[pm];B[ql];W[nk];B[kh];W[jf]C[[EV\] Slow move by W.  The fight below is more important.]
;B[lk]C[[EV\] Good!];W[lm];B[ih]C[[EV\] Slow move by B, again away from the main fight.]
;W[np];B[hf]C[a useless move?

[EV\] Violates the proverb "urgent moves before large moves".  The B group is already safely out into the center, and this move does not threaten anything.  This is your chance to get the upper hand in the lower right corner.]
;W[qm]C[I'm pretty confused about the next sequence...

[EV\] I can't read it all out either, but cutting looks like your only choice, and in the actual game you got a reasonable result.  So maybe W should hold back to something like Q6, protecting the cut and isolating the  Q4 stone.  B would be forced into a small life, and W would get a good result with no risk.]
;B[om];W[on];B[nm];W[ll];B[pn]C[[EV\] B should play O6 instead to escape.  W can now capture the cutting stones by playing O6.]
;W[qn];B[nn];W[oo];B[po];W[rp];B[mp];W[nq];B[no];W[op];B[pq]
C[is this the correct shape?

[EV\] This is the best shape to try to live in the corner, but unfortunately W can cut at N5 now and capture 4 stones, which would pretty much end the game.  Read it out and see if you agree.]
;W[mq];B[lp];W[kq];B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[rr];B[lq];W[lr];B[iq]
;W[jr];B[ir];W[ip]C[white wanted to play at l1, but thought that black's moyo would become to big

[EV\] Yes, W would have to live with center group, which would be difficult.]

(;B[is]C[[EV\] This is sometimes a clever move, when B is short on liberties, but here it is more important to take a W liberty, so just atari K1 directly.  I think B can capture W, but I may not have read everything out.  See the alternate sequence.]
;W[kr];B[or];W[mr];B[jo]C[mistake, misread of the the net.

[EV\] K6 would escape with better shape, giving W fewer forcing moves.  Not sure if W could still capture J3 stones.]
;W[io];B[jn];W[in];B[jm];W[gq];B[hp]C[White suggested g5?

[EV\] Maybe just J7 now to secure the center, while preserving as much aji as possible below.]
;W[hq];B[im];W[go];B[hm];W[gn];B[ro]C[What's the best possible result here? Can black expect to live? We had a sequence leading to seki, but it may have been wrong

[EV\] This looks like the best try.  I think B can get a ko (see later comments)]
;W[qo];B[qp];W[rn];B[rq];W[so];B[sq];W[rl]C[[EV\] This move does not threaten B -- the W center stones have too few liberties.  So B could live with R2 now.   W must play R2 to kill, but then B has a ko at T4.]
;B[rk];W[ri];B[si];W[qr];B[qq]
(;W[sm]C[[EV\] W can kill cleanly with Q2 (see alternate sequence) instead of defending here and leaving a ko for B.]
;B[rs];W[qs];B[id]C[Must be at f8 instead

[EV\] F8 expands B center, but not by a huge amount.  Living in the lower left corner before W adds a move there seems just as big.  This move is also not bad.]
;W[fl];B[dl]C[[EV\] Interesting idea.  Did you count B ahead if W encloses the corner?  It seems bigger to invade the corner deeply and steal the territory there.  With forcing moves like F3, it should still be possible to live.]
;W[dn];B[cn];W[co];B[cm];W[do];B[ch]C[[EV\] This move seems a little loose and small, considering the B influence in this area.  E10 would make a bigger moyo and would prepare a good follow-up at G9 to enclose the center.]
;W[cd];B[dd]C[[EV\] W has entered into B sphere of influence and should be attacked.  Contact plays generally strengthen both sides and are more for defense than attack.  Without reading out any complicated sequences, I prefer simply E17 here for B.]
;W[dc];B[ec];W[ce]C[[EV\] Maybe somewhere around here is a good time to start T2 ko?  The ko is worth over 40 pts and B now has lots of threats in the upper left corner.]
;B[db];W[cc];B[ed];W[cb];B[lc]C[another losing move. maybe d13?

[EV\] D13 is not so big, since W already has F8 poking into B center.  Your move seems fine.]
;W[cj];B[dj]C[[EV\] Without reading everything out, I guess B should try E9 to kill.  That would certainly be in the spirit of this fighting game.  The contact play lets W escape.

[EV\] There is still more difficult fighting, but I am running out of energy, so this is the last comment.  It was certainly an exciting game, and I hope some of my comments are useful.]
;W[ci];B[di];W[bh];B[bg];W[ck];B[bi]C[unreasonable, but I guess I felt the game slipping out of my grasp.]
;W[dk];B[ek];W[el];B[ah];W[fk];B[ej];W[bl];B[bm];W[dm];B[ad]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[da];B[ab];W[gb];B[fc];W[fa];B[hb]C[Better at j18. But still a ko in the corner.]
;W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[ib];W[hd];B[ge];W[ic];B[jc];W[jd])

(;W[mr];B[mo])))
(;W[qg];B[pd];W[oe];B[oc];W[nc];B[pb];W[ob];B[pc];W[md]C[[EV\] This is one reasonable continuation (joseki).  Two points relevant to the actual game:
1) The W wall has a weakness, but B does not cut immediately -- he would be at a disadvantage in the resulting fight without some nearby support. 
2) B does not extend further along the second line, as that would just help W increase his thickness.  W will not hurry to block there either, as it is not sente against the corner.]
