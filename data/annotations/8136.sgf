AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[N: Hi, I'm Jay (Numsgil KGS 5k) and I'll be reviewing the game.  I'll mark my comments by N, and keep all your current comments intact so you can cross reference :)  Other than this initial comment, my comments will come after yours.

I also deleted the few bad branches you had, so any branches in the game records are my own (and should be followed for fun comments ;) )

See the end of the game for my general thoughts on things to concentrate on for either player.

........


This is an over-the-board game, handicap 6, komi 0.5, Japanese scoring. No particular time-limits (game took around two hours).

Koroviev (white) is 12kyu KGS, Sku is 18/20kyu.

Comments for both sides would be appreciated, but particularly for black - especially general pointers on improvement, strategy etc. We reviewed the game afterwards, and our conclusion is that B tends to:
1) Play too slowly
2) Get bogged down in tactical battles and ignore the bigger picture.
3) Follow the stronger player around, and play too submissively.

We identified many basic mistakes from both sides here, but comments on our general play would be appreciated.

The game was a win for white, but by quite a small margin (3 or 4 points).



NOTE: There are a couple of branches in the game tree - these were just mistakes I made in transcribing the game, before backing up and continuing correctly.]
;W[jj]C[An experimental opening for white, just trying something out with no great plan.

(I did this because in high-handi games I have often found myself wishing I had some stones in the middle to run out to, when the sides get cramped).

N: This is playable, I think.  I've been doing tengen for some lower handicap games and it seems to work well enough.

In high handicap games, white needs to build up impressive influence he can use to break black apart into small pieces.  Forcing black to live small is the name of the game.  So tengen is definitely consistent with that strategy.

The only thing: keep in mind when you're playing that that stone is there and needs to be used.  That means white should concentrate on starting lots of running battles, and less on trying to grab territory (which isn't a good idea in high handicap games anyway).]
;B[jp];W[jd];B[jf]TR[jg]C[The right general idea perhaps (splitting white) but we couldn't decide if a more orthodox enclosure (e.g. O16 or similar) would have been better. On the one hand, it builds potential territory, on the other it may be too passive.

N: It's playable, but black needs to have a clear idea of what he's going for.  Killing white's stone here outright is unrealistic, because white should be able to either live easily or sacrifice it for good influence.

The best way for black to approach this board, if he wants to keep white on the defensive, is to try and force this stone to live small.  That means being careful not to allow white to sacrifice it.  Which means enclosing the stone on a BIG scale, so white can't afford to sacrifice it, and black can force it to live small.

With that idea, one higher, at triangle, would seem to be a bit better.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]TR[of]C[N: This is going for territory, which is inconsistent with white's first stone at tengen.  Triangle would be more consistent (though it's a hard, long slog to victory from here).]
(;B[ld]C[A mistake by white? R17 seems important here, especially with K16 stone pressuring the black group.

N: At best this is a bit overconcentrated, maybe.

Before playing here, black needs to decide what he wants from the position.  The best he could ask for is thickness facing the left side, which he can use to attack the stone there on a big scale.

See variations];W[qc];B[pc]
(;W[qe]TR[qg]SQ[pd][qc][rd]C[N: Something like triangle would make better shape.  There's a weakness here that should be protected, but this move is slow and gote.

In case it's not clear, the square stones form bad shape for white.  If the black square stone were not there, it would be better, but still not great.  The black stone is "peeping" at the weakness.

It doesn't work now, but it leaves some bad aji to take account of.

See variation for another idea.];B[pe]TR[of]C[N: This is slow gote for black.

At issue here: black already had 5 liberties, and white has even more.  You only need 5 liberties for a string of stones for it to be "stable" against contact attacks.  So once you have 5 liberties, you generally want to jump to get ahead.  Black's move here is unnecessary, and white doesn't have to respond.

http://webpages.charter.net/suewilcox/Contact.htm  This is an interactive book on go that covers these sorts of ideas.  If either player wants to spend some cash on a theory "book", this would be a good investment.

If black wants to play around here, triangle would be better.  Jump out and ahead once you have enough liberties.]
;W[gd];B[id]TR[gf]C[Would black be better off making an extension around D14, or would that be too passive?

N: D14 would be fine.  It would be considered to lack "fighting spirit", but with a 6 stone handicap black should not aim to make complex fights.

Triangle is another thought.  It gives white room to live on the top, but black builds up a terrifying wall that white is going to have a hard time defeating.

Black's actual move here is terrible for a number of reasons:

1.  This is a situation where it's better to force the opponent to live small.

2.  When you attack a single stone DO NOT attach to it.  It's counter intuitive, but you want to stay at least one space away from stones you are attacking.  The problem is that attaching forces white and black to strengthen themselves.  But black is already strong.

Conversely, white should consider attaching on nearby black stones to strengthen himself.]
;W[he];B[ie];W[ec];B[hc]TR[dc]C[B is aiming here at taking white's base, but perhaps that is unimportant since W already has access to centre?

N: Generally speaking, there are times where carving out the base is a good move, since you can chase them around and gain profit in some way (territory or influence) while the running group doesn't get any points at all.

My concern in this position is that white would just push at triangle and black has helped white hurt black's handicap stone on the left.

So as black, I would play triangle first.  It should be sente (so you'd get it for free).  If white tries to tenuki, then you play 18 here to try and gouge out the base and force white to run.]
;W[dc]C[N: Yes, this is the proper response for white.];B[ed]
;W[fc];B[ff]C[Strange move...B said afterwards he was aiming at enclosing White, but I think this is too loose, and B D16 stones need reinforcing first.

N: If we pretend that this white group is weak and has only a single eye along the top edge, this is reasonable for black.  White is forced to run, so black gets to make this move in sente, and therefore gets free profit (builds up a moyo along the left edge).

The problem is that white is almost certainly alive on top, so white doesn't have to respond.]
;W[cd]TR[cc]C[N: Yes, if you're concerned about life.  I _think_ that white can live even if black gets the hane at triangle, but it would be tense.  So I don't blame white for this at all.]
;B[gc]C[N: If black is concerned about life for these stones, maybe this is okay.  But honestly, this just helps white fix weaknesses.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ee]C[Bad for black, we decided later.

N: Black should probably sacrifice these stones, actually.  They don't threaten white, or separate white, or really help enclose white all that well.  So they're just heavy.  If it's fewer than, say, 3 stones, you should be willing to sacrifice them.]
;W[ce]C[N: Yes, black failed to enclose.  Jump out.];B[fb]C[Wrong time for this move, as white's group is already safe?

N: Yes, bad timing.  This ends in gote for black if white responds.  I think white can even just tenuki and take sente.]
;W[eb];B[gb];W[ch]C[We looked back at this point after the game and decided that black has come off poorly in the top left, about equal in the top right, and has both territory and maybe influence on the top side. But now he he plays poorly, getting bogged down in the top left and ending up in very bad shape. What was the right move here for black?

N: Sacrificing the stones at move 26 would have fixed this up nicely.  I agree with your assessment of the game state.  Black's entire left side is undercut, so even here, black's best move is to sacrifice his stones and recover the moyo.]
(;B[df]C[N: These stones aren't worth saving, but if they were, this _might_ be reasonable.  White gets to fix his weakness here, though, which is NOT GOOD for black.]
;W[cf]C[N: Yes];B[dg]C[N: This exchange is probably necessary to save the black stones, but white gets territory which he isn't complaining about at all.]
(;W[cg]C[N: eh, see variation];B[ef]C[N: No.  What little "shape" there was in the area is now gone.  These stones are just heavy now.]
;W[dh]TR[ei]C[Pressuring black's overconentrated shape...

N: Yes, this is okay.  I'd prefer triangle, as it does the job faster, and black can't afford to try and cut just now.

If you're concerned about the cut, this is fine.

White should get influence and black gets his stones not to die.  White gets the better end of the deal.]
;B[gf];W[hf]C[N: Yes, keep the pressure up.];B[gg]
(;W[hg]C[N: No, this doesn't give you useful profit.  Black has to respond, but make sure you aren't just attacking for the sake of attacking.  Have an idea of what you're aiming for.

This would be called "bad direction" in go books.

See variation];B[eh];W[hi];B[gh];W[hh];B[ei]C[N: Black is looking pretty safe, and white doesn't have much to show for it.  He has thickness facing the right side, but black is strong over there, so this thickness isn't super useful.]
;W[pf]C[N: Reasonable, since you'll have to do SOMETHING with the influence in the center, so you'll need some groups with access to the center.]
;B[jh];W[ng]C[Since black didn't block, white jumps out.

N: Reasonable.];B[ii];W[ij]
(;B[li]C[N: No, don't push on a "link" if you don't intend to cut.

See variation];W[ji]TR[hj]C[N: Careful white, you NEED to figure out how to protect the cutting point at triangle.  You can make these forcing exchanges if you like, but be sure to go back and play "honte".  White's stones would be floating in a sea of black if white gets cut off.

See http://senseis.xmp.net/?Honte];B[ih];W[kh];B[jg];W[ki]TR[hj]
C[N: White has loosely connected all of his stones.

Allowing white to do this is BAD for black.  Keep white separated.

However the cut at triangle is still causing white night terrors.]
(;B[hl]C[N: This looks big, but the corner is still unprotected, and it's gote.]
;W[qi];B[lh]C[N: Black is just forcing white to continue to separate him.  So unless black needs thickness here (he does not), this is just helping white.]
;W[pi]TR[qj]C[N: Seems okay to tenuki, but I would prefer triangle if you want to play here.  Standing up like this makes white overconcentrated.]
;B[hj]C[N: Oh no!  White should have defended the weakness earlier.]
;W[qj]C[N: Sacrificing the center stones is a bold move, but probably the only thing you can do at this point.]
(;B[ok]C[N: Black is protecting a stone that serves no function.]
;W[pk];B[oj];W[pl];B[om];W[pm]TR[ij][jj][ji][ki][kh]C[Seems bad for black.

N: White is building up 4th line territory, but black is building a wall that threatens white's weak triangled group, and turns the bottom of the board into a large moyo.

Seems okay for black. :)]
(;B[qn]TR[qm]C[W didn't want to block directly at R7 as it seemed like ugly shape, but maybe he should have done?

N: Depends on what white wants from this situation.  Blocking at triangle is indeed bad shape, but if white is concerned with territory this seems fine.

However, in this situation, damn the territory!  White is in no danger of dying, so maybe consider just breaking into black's moyo a bit.

For black: This move is bad.  Continue pushing white towards your star stone and build up a nice wall.  See variation]
;W[ol]C[N: Yes, creates weaknesses.];B[nl]C[N: Yes, defends, even though there are now weaknesses.]

(;B[no]TR[pq]C[N: There's still a stone at triangle to take care of.  It can maybe make life still.  Or if not life, it's way too much aji to just leave.]
;W[rm]C[N: Problem is that this ends in gote.  Don't make moves like this until the end game unless you're sure you can either do it in sente or you can kill the group you're attacking.]
;B[rn];W[sl]
(;B[oi]C[N: Ugh, not really useful.];W[oh]C[N: Also not really useful.  This area is small, and neither black nor white can really cut the other off beyond a stone or two.]

(;B[rp]C[N: You probably can't kill, black.  Even if you could threaten to kill, just keep white enclosed instead and keep things simple and good for you.  See variation.]
;W[rq];B[sq];W[rr];B[sp]C[N: Gote?  No, you want sente to enclose white.]
;W[lq]C[N: Oh no, white is loose now.];B[lp];W[kq];B[jq];W[kp]
;B[ko];W[lo]TR[jo]C[N: If you do this, you MUST cut at triangle right after.  Or you're just helping black by killing ko threats and aji.]
;B[mo];W[cj]TR[jo]SQ[kp]C[N: No, follow through at triangle!  Or you make pushing up at square aji keshi (http://senseis.xmp.net/?AjiKeshi).]
;B[lr]C[N: Aji keshi for black, now.];W[kr];B[jr];W[ls];B[ln]
C[N: This might feel slow, but I think it's probably a great move!  Don't leave horrible aji lingering around, especially against white in handicap games.]
;W[dk]C[N: But now white gets this move :(];B[ek];W[dl];B[el]
;W[dm];B[en]TR[fn]SQ[em]C[N: This type of move only works if you're the one along the edge.  Triangle would be the normal move.  The problem is that it leaves too much aji at square.]
;W[dn];B[co];W[cn]C[W blocks directly this time.

N: In this position, I think this is wise.  It's an empty triangle, but I honestly can't think of a move that would be strictly better.  It seems proper in this case.]
;B[bo];W[dq]TR[cn]C[N: This is inconsistent with triangle.  If you want territory, seal it off.  If you want to invade, don't strengthen black first.]
;B[cq];W[pb];B[ob];W[qa];B[kk]TR[dq]C[N: This would normally be good timing to take care of this aji, but what about the triangle stone!]

N: This is really the only way for new players to get a feel for what is safe and what isn't, so forgivable for black as long as he doesn't die in gote.  But yeah, this isn't going to work.]
;W[nr];B[hs];W[gs];B[ik]TR[gi]C[It was decided in our review after the game that B wasted a lot of moves on this central white group that was clearly already dead

N: Certainly this is probably a wasted move.  The previous moves might be necessary in terms of reducing aji, but black should only play moves like this when he's ahead.

Triangle, for instance, would also remove much of this aji, but it would do so in profit instead of 0 profit.]

In terms of either player:

White: Played well, but work on:

1.  Make moves that have your stones working together.  Don't go for territory if you play tengen on the first move.

2.  Direction: Don't build walls that face useless areas of the board.

Black: Played less well :)  Work on:

1.  Sacrificing stones that have no purpose.

2.  Allowing white to take territory while you build useful walls for moyos.

3.  Don't push unless you're going to follow it with a cut.

4.  Don't follow white around the board in the endgame.  If you let white take all the sente moves, there'll be none left for you.

5.  Take sente when you can.  Don't get tunnelvision for one area of the board.

6.  But at the same time, don't underestimate the aji of stones.  Don't let white build living groups when you could have killed him because you wanted sente too soon.
