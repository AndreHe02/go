C[k12 [9k\]: hi

[w\]=brett1138

[w\]ok, I'll start off by saying this game is a little embarassing.  I'm not sure how I came up with some of the moves I used, in retrospect, but I guess hindsight is 20/20.  I'll say my opponent definitely played more respectably than I and deserved the win.

[w\]I played as white, which was a stumbling block for me, as I usually like to make a san-ran-sei... time to branch out i guess : )

[w\]I guess what I'm looking for is... what kind of moves should I be looking at instead of some of the weak, almost random maneuvers that I played this game?  I have commented some moves, wondering what might've been better and explaining what I was trying to accomplish when i played it.  I also added variations of lines of play that I saw later, after stepping away for awhile.

[w\]In a game like this almost anything will be helpful.];B[pc]
C[Hi Brett,

It was a pleasure reviewing your game and I enjoyed doing it.

In general there are three things that really stick out in your game that need improvement. 
- the direction of play 
- Sente
- overplay

More specific remarks are below in the file.

Regarding B. There was more sense of direction in your play and you definitely dominated the game through a better use of sente and much less overplay. 

For both B and W goes to try to find the biggest move. Ask yourself questions like; what if my opponent would play here ? Does my opponent need to respond ? What happens if he doesn't ?Is this move necessary for me ? What if I omit it ? etc.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me.

Good luck!
Lothar.];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]C[W D16 is too slow B will close at least one corner so normally the Shusaku opening is answered with W P4 or P3.]
;B[cn]C[B should simply play P3 or P4]
(;W[fp]C[[w\]here black invaded before I could make my favorite formation, so I reacted in as safely as i could.  In retrospect maybe a pincer would've been better?

Better here is F3 (preventing B H3 -> open skirt) or indeed pincer which would make a nice extension from D16.]
;B[dk];W[jd]C[[w\]here is my attempt at grabbing a big point and setting up a familiar formation (still thinking handicap/san-ran-sei)

Forget the sanren-sei if B C6 didn't already ruin it B D9 did so completely.

The biggesty point on the board is simply Q/R15 and P3/4. Corners first!]
;B[fc]C[Mistake no need to invade there are bigger moves to play.]
;W[ec];B[fd]C[[w\]just what i wanted here];W[df]C[Because of B D9 you may want to descend to3rd row to prevent B C12 wich would make a perfect extension from D9 and attack white in sente.]
;B[ic]C[B in trouble];W[jc]C[[w\]with this i hoped to overconcentrate the black stones, but i think i just made myself heavy.

No this is good B has no space to make 2 eyes and must jump out into the center.]
;B[ch]C[ouch exactly what I feared. However it's a bit premature because of B's weak F17 group. W should punish with F14. See var.]

(;W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[ge]C[This is a very slow move from B. B should play F14. W should profit.]
;W[dh]C[It is sente but the action is somewhere else.. W should cap B at G13.]
;B[di]
(;W[eh]C[This is wrong. W can play a double hane at E11 and either seriouosly threaten B's F17 group or take profit on the left side. See var.]
;B[dj]C[B should obviously play E11 and push back.]
(;W[pe]C[[w\]wrong side, but i was hoping for what happened next.  also, i preferred black to live on the third line instead of the fourth. 

See var.

Wrong side ? Absolutely not! However you had unfinished business regarding B's very weak group at F17!]

(;B[mc]C[Prefer B O16. See var.];W[od];B[oc]
(;W[nd]C[[w\]this was just the result i hoped for... a little influence to build with

Play N15 instead of O16, seal B in and connect to K17.];B[nq]
C[Nice move by B!];W[jp]TR[pj]C[[w\]i think i should've jumped out from my new wall here, putting a stone where black would like to have one for a nice moyo shape.  I realized that about 5 seconds after I played k4.  too late :)

The biggest point on the  board is an extension from B's large (ogeima) shimari . W should thus play exactly where B wants play.]
;B[hq]C[there's only one move here and that's R10/Q10.]
(;W[gq]C[I understand that your trying to defend your corner territory, but I just don't like G3 because you allow B to split you up. Besides territory should be obtained while attacking your opponent..

In the variation you will see another way of thinking where B will take some territory but W will build a powerful wall .]
;B[hr]C[very strange move by B may be a missclick ? Should have been H4.]
;W[hp]C[[w\]I went for the hane instead of protecting the monkey jump... i think it was a mistake in retrospect.

no it's correct you can prevent B from splitting you up. B should worry about connecting his 2 heavy stones to O3.]
;B[kr]C[W can respond with W K2. Work it our yourself.]
(;W[pj]C[Good idea. R9 would have been perfect. See var.];B[ph]
C[B should still extend from the shimari to Q8.]
(;W[mj]C[[w\]i was still thinking moyo here... make a box while attacking the q12 stone.  but i just provoked it to make life

The problem start with Q10 on the 4th line. B R4 is on the 3rd so it would have been more logical to also play on the 3rd line. Instead of N10 R7 would have been good. 

You also have two weak groups at the top that you need to take in consideration before you play N10.]
;B[qf];W[qe];B[qj];W[jj]C[[w\]here's where the 'fun' starts (maybe it started already?)

This I don't understand. Why attack B Q12 and then let him get away with R10? The only move her would be W R9.]
;B[qk]C[There B goes..];W[qc];B[qb];W[rc];B[nc]
(;W[le]C[Good idea but it's not sente. See the var. How to keep sente and instead of making a single move, making a sequence of moves. It's like making sentences instead of uttering single words.]
;B[id];W[ie]C[B is in trouble here and could lose both groups.]
;B[he];W[if]
(;B[fb]C[There's a solution see var.];W[lb];B[mb];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[eb];B[jb]C[The corner group has bigger problems. So first B S18.]
;W[kb];B[ia];W[rb];B[je]C[Good move.]
(;W[kd]C[[w\]open triangle, i know... but if i had laddered there would be a cutting point at l17 which bothered me for some reason.  any suggestions?

It's an ugly thing an empty triangle but here it does the job. However as you pointed out in your own var. W L15 would have prevented B group N18 to connect to B group J17 at least without having to deal with the Ko. But that would have required some more reading.]

(;W[ra]C[Overplay. The right sequence is in the var.];B[ob]
;W[na];B[ma];W[oa];B[nb];W[pa];B[ka];W[la];B[ld]

(;W[pb]C[[w\]couldn't think fast enough to see a way out of this

B get's away without having to play the Ko.];B[lc];W[me];B[pf]

(;W[of]C[This is not the way to prevent B from entering your moyo. see var for a more effective way.]

(;B[og]C[There's a better way of getting in. B O13. W didn't play the double hane but it was there. See var.]
;W[ng];B[nh]
(;W[nf]C[W can play the double hane. see var.];B[mh]C[[w\]ugh this was right where it counts.... but i suppose it's too early to think about center territory anyway anyway, right?

Not really. After all it's all about the points and you just lost about 20.  see the var. how to handle situations like this.]
;W[no]TR[jj][mj][pj][jp]C[[w\]trying to find a way to reduce and build something at the same time... are these all too far apart to be useful at all?

Attack and build that's the idea and O5 doesn't really attacks so B tenuki's and goes in to the center.

On the other hand B has 3 ways to get into the center so defending it will not be possible. W is suffering from the mistakes in the opening and middle game.]
;B[ol];W[qo];B[pp];W[po];B[ml]C[Good move.];W[oi];B[oh];W[rm]
;B[rl];W[mq]C[Good move from W.]

(;B[es]C[Good move. But more an endgame move take a look at the var.]

(;W[cs]C[See var.];B[hs]
(;W[cr];B[lm]C[W doesn't respond so now B should play M5];W[qm]
C[Way too small and no sente. Look at W S15, S5 M12, E6 or  F10.]

(;B[ql]C[B should tenuki. See var.];W[jm]C[You do try to make territoy here but if you do it like this then B will play F7 and expand his own teriitory while decreasing yours, and that's exactly what you should do. So not W K7 but W E7 which also threatens W C7.]
;B[nk]C[This is a typical thank you move. W will connect and says thanks!]

(;W[nj]C[[w\]I think i have trouble giving up stones, in retrospect g9 is much bigger

Especially because B needs to make another move in order to ecrually capture P11 and Q10. See var.]
;B[gk]C[Better F6.];W[dm]C[[w\]by this point i'm completely lost, just trying to make reductions and build anything that will hold a few points... thinking at this point i'm fairly well behind, since the center is slowly becoming dame and the bottom right is too big.

So B can ignore this move.];B[kh]C[B tenuki's and does prevent w from taking territory. However it's not sente. Probably the biggest move on the board right now is B A13 (or W B11).]

Yes, quite unfortunate because there are still some big points in sente to be made at the right edge of the board.
