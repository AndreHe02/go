C[Hello
In this game  i had an easy start but in the yose i didnt notice the status of my group and lost.
however i was behind even before this mistake.
my main questions are about my moves which let b have the center.
thanks

Hi :)

I think the main problem in this game was the many moves White played on the right side without gaining much. In the meantime Black made many points in the center...

Anyway, here are my comments. I hope they are of some help :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[ed];B[fq];W[hq]LB[dn:B][po:A]TR[pq]C[With the marked stone in place, is this really a good move? I would prefer A or B instead.]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[fm]LB[ip:A]C[Better the normal move at A.];W[dl]
C[seems natural];B[kq];W[gp];B[fp];W[hn]LB[ip:A]TR[gp]C[Now, A is a very good point for Black.]
;B[gl]LB[ip:A]C[Black should have played at A];W[kn]LB[jo:A]
C[Maybe better at A?];B[ip];W[io];B[hp]LB[go:A][iq:B]C[If Black wants to cut, A is better, no? But I would prefer to play at B anyway.]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[qo];W[go];B[gq];W[fn];B[en]
;W[gn];B[em];W[eo];B[dm];W[hr]C[This is dangerous.];B[gr]LB[dr:A]
TR[dm]C[I don't think Black should answer here. Having played the marked stone, A is logical next move. Losing the four stones isn't so big, since the white group was strong already.]
;W[cm]LB[dr:A];B[cn];W[do];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]
;B[cl]LB[bo:A]C[Of course I, too, can't read such a complicated fight, but here Black really should play at A instead. Please try the variations after that - I think Black is winning there!]
;W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[bm];W[bs];B[ds];W[es];B[bo];W[aq]C[b got thickness but i felt i got nice bunch of points.

Sure, White is ahead here, but not by that much, I think...]
;B[im];W[kp];B[lo];W[jn];B[cd];W[cc]LB[ef:A]C[A should be an idea, too.]
;B[bc];W[dc];B[cg];W[be];B[bd];W[ce];B[de];W[dd];B[cf];W[ee]
;B[df];W[bb];B[ae]LB[bf:A]C[B should play at A here :)];W[jc]
;B[lc];W[je]LB[fg:A]C[This is to slow, I think. Better at A!]
;B[le]LB[qd:A]C[Better at A.];W[qc]C[wrong timing?

Hm. I think splitting the right side would be less troublesome?]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[qn]
;B[po];W[ql];B[qj];W[ro];B[rp];W[rm]LB[ol:A]C[I would jump to A instead.]
;B[ok];W[om];B[nn]LB[gf:A]C[A strange move. Black is still behind, so A to make the left side as big as possible should be more interesting?]
;W[nm]LB[rk:A]C[Both sides play dame points, I think. Isn't A big?]
;B[mm];W[on];B[oo];W[ml];B[lm];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rq];W[nk]
;B[he];W[hc];B[ff]C[Now Black has  a chance.];W[oj];B[pj];W[oi]
C[i should tenuki here?

It's a big move :)];B[id];W[ic];B[jd];W[kd];B[ke];W[kc];B[nb]

;W[ld]LB[mq:A]C[it seems like it was too slow

Much too slow! Even a pure territorial move like A is much bigger.]

(;W[mr]LB[rk:A]TR[nm]C[ive should just take the stone,but i didnt see the danger :{

Yes, but the game is good for Black anyway. Look at all the stones White played on the left side without gaining anything! Starting action there with the marked stone instead of playing A was a bad strategy, I think.]

i was suprised to see i was behind even before i lost the group
thanks for your time

--------------------------------------

This was a very interesting game :) Too sad you lost it in the end... 

Good luck with your next games!])
