(;W[qj]C[I dont know if is better to play here or q10 or if its the same.

csh: It's not the same. Q10 is more of a reduction. Generally, if there is not enough space to expand on either side, then you would play a move like Q10 to create a light group that can reduce Black's territory, but still run away. See the variation.

Since there is room to make a two-space expansion on either side, R10 is a better move. The group will have a stable base and be harder to attack.]

(;W[df]C[csh: One thing to think about is possibly a different joseki here. Playing the attach-and-extend joseki solidifies the black group, making it harder to attack later. It also ends in gote. See the variation.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[ci];W[jf]C[f17 seem too small. I also was thinking on k3.

csh: F17 (or F16) does seem small, but protecting the cut is bigger than it looks. The bigger moyo (framework) that you try to create ends up being useless if Black pushes through and cuts.

K3 is also a big move. 

One thing to note is that K14 and K17 do not relate together well. It's hard to connect the two stones together with one move, so you may end up playing an "extra" move later to fix weaknesses. In this aspect, K15 works better with K17.]

csh: I don't agree. I think White's attack on the running black group still tilted the game in White's favor. While White didn't make much profit, Black made absolutely zero points, so the balance was still in White's favor. Black also didn't get influence from the group, as you had stones surrounding it on either side.]
