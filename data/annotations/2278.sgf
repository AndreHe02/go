C[Most Important Advice
- in the opening, don't play further than the 4th line away from the edge, until the corner and sides are all claimed
(exceptions are if a group is in danger, for example if 'pinched' jump toward the centre or connect underneath, if possible)
- play in large gaps between stones to link them up and form side territory
- protect your territory in the corners and sides, don't let opponent 'get below' and skirt into your territory
BTW, I also play on KGS as kk1.

SQ[of][qi]C[An approach to a stone on the 4th line is usually done on the 3rd line, r14. This threatens to sneak into the corner, and helps to 'seal' the end of you territory by being closer to the edge of the board. If white (W) defends the corner, a very safe follow up move is r11. If W pinches by playing at r12, escape with the move at p14.]
;W[nd];B[cn];W[df];B[ch];W[cf];B[le]TR[ic][dj]SQ[fc][lc]C[d10 would be better because it almost joins up with the corner and stakes a claim on the left side. If you choose to invade, pick and open spot on the 3rd line, such as j17, then you have the option of a 2-point jump left or right--if W plays one, jump the other way to take territory and safety.]
;W[of];B[mg]TR[qj][qm]C[These stones would be more effective if they had been played to take side territory. Compare the situation to if they had been played at the marks. It takes more stones (and turns) to get the same amount of territory in the open centre of the board than in the corners or sides, so take the big and quick points first.]
;W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[pf];B[pi]C[That was a good sequence for B. W didn't get much and you have a solid group--even better if you link it up with the bottom corner.]
;W[jq];B[lo]TR[mq]C[Too far from edge. If W plays on 3rd line, you should do same to prevent sneaking into your side and corner area.]

TR[dk];W[lc];B[nk];W[qg];B[pk]TR[qh]C[These two weren't really necessary, you're pretty strong there already. You should stop the seepage of W at R13 instead.]
;W[rh];B[qq]TR[ri]C[This corner is a bit vulnerable but, not as much as the invasion into the side from above, so defend there first.]
;W[rj];B[rl];W[rk];B[ql];W[sl];B[sm];W[sk]C[ZeroKun [30k?\]: finally some makes good moyo
ZeroKun [30k?\]: someone*];B[mr]TR[rm]C[You must defend against W playing at s7--see the variation.
N2 is not needed to make your group safe, and only gets a few extra points of territory.]

(;W[lr];B[ms]TR[ck]C[Again, not yet needed. When you are not in trouble, play in a different area where more points can be claimed. The marked move is rock solid and takes all of the remaining left side, as well as making a wall facing toward the open middle for more potential territory, especially combined with G5.]
;W[ls];B[os]C[Not needed, and better played at P2 or O2.];W[mq]
;B[or];W[ff];B[gg]C[That's quite good because it can be used to make large territory in the L11 area, or in the E9 area--but not both, since W can break through one of the sides.]
;W[eh];B[dj];W[di];B[ci];W[ej];B[dk];W[ek];B[dh];W[ei];B[bg]
;W[bf];B[jj]C[That was very good, secured territory on the left side, and staked out a big area in the middle.]

C[Good, that was one of the threats into your large claim.]

;W[pb];B[rd]TR[qb]C[The 3-3 corner invasion is good, but follow up by making a two-stone wall between W and the edge. If you defend the corner, it's much easier to make life.]

;B[bh];W[ah];B[ai];W[af];B[me];W[md];B[nf];W[oe]C[The variation was just to see if B could've lived in the top right. I also think it's a lost cause at this point.]

C[There are two weaknesses left here. One is immediate at S7, as I already pointed out.
The other is at A10 which would cause loss if not for the extra liberty at C13. See the following variation, if B were to ignore it.
After reading the review, go back to the beginning and re-read the summary comments. If you apply them you can jump 5 kyu without much else.
