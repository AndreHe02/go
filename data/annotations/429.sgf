DT[1997-07-13]TM[600]KM[0.500000];B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dc];B[de];W[cd]C[W6. Too low, and not good! W should play any of the many excellent Joseki variations available instead of this.]
;B[ce]C[B7. Goes along with W, but O.K., since it coordinates well with B1.]
;W[cj]C[W8. Very aggressive, although the obvious idea behind W6. Despite this, better here would be the simple F16, since B must then play at C11. Even if playing as W does, C11 would be better because after the text B could choose to play C12 (despite its being overconcentrated), giving him miai to either squeeze W8 or press down at E17 on the W corner. Neither of these scenarios is particularly good for W, which is why W6 wasn't good.]
;B[fc]C[B9. At E17 is correct. This allows W to come out at E16 and split W.]
;W[bd]C[W10. Making your position still lower! Coming out at E16 is called for.]
;B[be]C[B11. Very passive, and making W8 look good! Instead, C12 stabilizes the B stones and takes Sente because of its pressure on W8. Also feasible is E17 to contain W and take advantage of his low position. Finally, B could even tenuki now profitably.]
;W[ed]C[W12. Better late than never!];B[ic]C[B13. Too timid! To justify B11, C7 or 8 now is called for.]
;W[cn]C[W14. This is O.K., but C13 would be stronger, because then the 3 B stones have no base!]
;B[fp];W[cq]C[W16. A bad idea in this position! Instead, B4 to strengthen W while inducing B's C3, then attack the 3 Blacks as previously noted.]
;B[cp]C[B17. Of course. W's advantage is now dissipated.];W[bp];B[bo];W
[bq];B[co];W[er];B[fr];W[eq];B[fq]C[B25. Bad. B has no clear objective here, but wants to hold onto everything - a losing strategy because it's infeasible.  Instead, connect at E4, and then ATTTACK the weak W8, 14 stones above. The W push at 25 would be far too small and slow to even worry about now. And that's what was wrong with W16 on the 3-3 point!]
;W[dq];B[kq]C[B27. The wrong idea here! The position cries out for C8 instead, but even the hard connection at E4 is better than the text. Once B has established such solid thickness, he can only welcome a W invasion on the lower side!]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[fo]C[W30. Kamikaze Go! W8, 14 are too weak to sustain this kind of aggression.]
;B[fn]C[B31. Wrong! Must be at E6, and the fight strongly favors B. This only helps W.]
;W[go]C[W32. Better to leave W30 for the moment and play either C13 or the B6, D6, E10 combination. W30, 32 are now a weak group which needs watching.]
;B[dn]C[B33. Better at E6.];W[hq]C[W34. Scores a (not very large) coup on the lower side, but at what price? B now has Sente with which to play C12 or D11 (or even E10, if he thinks that he can handle the complications) and repair the damage his previous bad play did on the left side.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[hn]C[B37. Better to play immediately on the left side as previously noted, especially since this isn't Sente.]
;W[io]C[W38. Not strictly necessary. If B38 next, W G3. Much better now is C13 and B is "sucking wind" on both fronts.]
;B[ee]C[B39. Too slow, because it allows W to play first on the left side and neutralize it.]
;W[fd]C[W40. Good locally, but once again ignores the opportunity on the left side.]
;B[di];W[dj];B[ej];W[ei];B[dh]C[B45. Allows W too much room to maneuver. At C11 is much stronger, with B's thickness above to back up these stones.]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[dl];B[fk]C[B49. At C7 instead makes W work much harder to achieve life here, if he can!]
;W[cm]C[W50. The key point! and now W's life here is easily assured.];B
[dm]C[B51. This is not a key point! At least if now B8, (or even B11) W has to show some skill to achieve life.]
;W[em];B[fm];W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bi]C[
 herve 9k*: is entering byo-yomi];W[bn];B[ao]C[B59. As a result of B's bad play to this point, he's now faced with the unpleasant necessity of somehow preventing a nasty W atari at this same point. The problem is that his move has no effect at all on W, and is therefore PURE GOTE.]
;W[gc]C[W60. Of course! W is having everything his way in this game, and thus far it's been no contest!]
;B[ge]C[B61. A nice point for later, but too small to play now. Instead, O3 is probably best, and such moves as O17 aren't too far behind.]
;W[fe]C[W62. Misses the point and unnecessarily dances to Black's tune. Instead, seize Sente via O3, which is also territorially huge.]
;B[ff];W[gf];B[gg]C[B65. Making the same mistake as with B31. B is far stronger here, so the simple H15 is correct.]
;W[hf];B[he];W[fg]C[
 asroot 10k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[ef];W[hg];B[gh];W[ie]C[W72. B's mistake with B65 unnecessarily has allowed W to build a strong formation here.]
;B[hd]C[B73. And the need for this bad shape move definitively demonstrates that fact!   CAUTION!! Black's play has been very weak, and W should NOT be deluded intto thinking that his own good play has produced the good result he's getting in this game. Against more competent opposition, this kind of opportunity will NOT often arise!]
;W[id];B[hc];W[fb];B[gb];W[ec];B[kc];W[fl]C[W80. A tricky play, but better is to simply stabilize his own still weak  stones via K14 before attempting anything like this.]
;B[gl]C[B81. Far better at H9, and W's scheme is foiled.];W[el];B[en];W
[gk];B[hl];W[fi];B[gj]C[B87. B is completely befuddled by W's play. But these 3 stones are no longer very important. Instead, B should play F12 to catch W68 and stabilize his own left side. Then if W persists in capturing the 3 stones, cut at J14.]
;W[gi];B[hj];W[hh];B[eg];W[fh];B[nc]C[B93. Now, B still has watch his left side group carefully, because the Ko Aji there is very bad!! (D13, in particular).]
;W[qf];B[jg]C[B95. The W group is now far too strong to have any realistic play against, and in any case the timing of such an attack must be very carefully planned. Here, it seems premature, so B would be better advised to play on the lower right as previously noted. In any event, at K14 is superior to the text for B.]
;W[jh]C[W96. simpler to just play at K14, on the key shape point.];B[ke]
;W[kg];B[jf];W[kf];B[if];W[ig];B[je];W[lh];B[ii]C[B103. Probing first at L11 is better, but all of this is better deferred in favor of playing now at O3 to consolidate the lower right.]
;W[ji];B[jj]C[
 herve 9k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[ih];B[lj]C[B109. Not big. Better to leave B105,7 as forcing moves and play now at O3 as prreviously noted.]
;W[li]C[W110. Very slow and pure Gote! Locally  I'd much prefer O13 or 14, but globally O3 seems best now.]
;B[ko]C[B111. Here, I'd think that O3 was far more prudent, but this certainly isn't all bad by any means.]
;W[op];B[pn]C[B113. This leaves W112 with entirely too much room to maneuver. Instead, attaching at P3 looks good.]
;W[qq]C[W114. Probing first at M4 is interesting.];B[pp];W[pq];B[nq];W[rp]
C[ asroot 10k*: has entered byo-yomi again
W118. Connecting at P3 is OK because W can not only then live here with ease, but is also led out into the B moyo.]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[oq];W[or];B[nr];W[pr];B[qn]C[B123. Suddenly, B is back in the game! (All as a result of W's emphasis on aggressive tactics instead of on a calm strategic approach.)]
;W[rs]C[W126. NOT necessary! W is alive no matter how B attacks. (for example, if B126, W on R1, B S2, W T2 makes miai of P1 and T4.) This is a VERY costly pure Gote play!!!]
;B[pj];W[qi];B[qj];W[ni];B[nj];W[mj];B[mk];W[mi];B[nk]C[B135. A mistake. At M9 instead keeps a lot more of the moyo.]
;W[kj];B[pi];W[qh];B[ph]C[B139. Not worth much, and not Sente either. Q18 is much bigger, then follow with O15.]
;W[kk]C[W140. Because of the possibility for W K6, this isn't urgent. Q18 instead is better.]
;B[qg];W[rg];B[pg];W[rf];B[pb]C[B143. Better late than never.];W[qc];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[ri]C[B149. Too slow. Instead, Q17 to induce a W respnse in the corner, then S19 ( but only if Sente), followed by O15.]
;W[pc]C[W150. Seizes the key point!];B[oc];W[km];B[ln];W[lm];B[mm];W[kn]
;B[lo]C[
 herve 9k*: has entered byo-yomi again];W[jn]C[W158. Unnecessary, and cedes Sente for no gain. Instead, N14 stabilizes the W stones and makes some more territory. In any event, this is exceedingly bad shape. At least play J6 instead (with a later threat to play at H7 if and when feasible).]
;B[ir];W[hr]C[B161. Consider B159 as a forcing move, and switch now to the hane at A16.]
;B[iq];W[ns]C[W162. The hane at A15 is MUCH bigger and better!];B[ms]C[B163. Instead, A16 seizes Sente!]
;W[os];B[mr];W[le];B[ld];W[me]C[
 asroot 10k*: has entered byo-yomi again];B[oe]C[B169. Worthless. There's no territory here for either side.  Locally, the simple jump to O13 is better, but neither is correct now. A16 is still called for.]
;W[qa];B[oa];W[od]C[W172. Just as wrong, for the same reasons. Best is still the hane at A15.]
;B[nd];W[is];B[js];W[hs];B[ip];W[ae]C[W178. At last!];B[af];W[ad];B[bg]
;W[ci]C[W182. Gote, and unnecessary to boot. Simply connecting at B10 is correct.]
;B[ch];W[rh]C[W184. A monumental blunder! At B10 is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!]
;B[bj];W[dk];B[cl]C[B187. In the final analysis, W chased and harried B until he did himself in! But even if these stones had lived, as they certainly should, it's not clear that W was ahead! In fact, by my (not so reliable) estimate he wasn't!]
