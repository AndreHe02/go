;B[pj];W[qm]C[OK, this opening is reasonable to my level of understanding. But now, the next black move should be discussed.]

(;B[fp]LB[jp:a]C[I don't like the high approach because if you come into ennemy territory, you would like to be able to settle yourself quickly. and the low approach is better for this purpose.]
;W[dn];B[ip]C[Better one space right I think. you have to developp yourself very quickly in order to reduce the maximum of territory. If white attacks, you will be separated but it will leave aji in the white structure and this is good for black : aji.]
;W[kp];B[fn]C[now you see that it would be better to settle down in the lower side : the only effect of black 17 is to allow white to enclose the left side and to have territory ! Even if white plays at 17, you invade at d9 and destroy it!]
;W[dk]C[see the var]
(;B[fg]C[since B19 has no direct effect on the white structure W6 and W10, it would be better one space right. It will have more effect against a white invasion.]
;W[jc]
(;B[lc];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd]C[B23 is a good move because it helps you to get out in the center and now B19 is ideally placed.But B25 is not necessary : you only reinforce white!]

(;B[he];W[id];B[fc];W[gb];B[fb]C[this is not a very good move : better to try to enclose white with l15 or M15 : after M15 your only goal is to play N10. Do you understand that ?]
;W[ie]C[e];B[hf];W[ld];B[md];W[le]C[you see that your moyo is not good now ?]
;B[me];W[kc];B[lb]C[no no! It is much more important to play M14 : hane! this brings you much more territory. What do you mind of saving the stone 21 ??? You want to kill ? that is not go : in go, we don't kill, we press the ennemy but rarely kill.]
;W[kb]C[OK, white answered, so you were quite right but me, I would have played hane at N14 and your territory would have been quite reduced!]
;B[pg]C[very very bad move. You play in your territory. Anyway, white will hane at N14, you will push at O14 and this stone B39 will be worthless. Please in the next games you play, do not try to make territory like this.]

[ah][ag][bg][af][jb][ic][jd]C[now, black has 43 points of secure territory and white has 36 of secure territory + 5,5 komi + about 10 points in the lower right corner (51,5) : white is in the lead because he has a group to attack and black has no group to attack.]

(;B[hb]C[very bad];W[hc];B[ga];W[ib];B[ha];W[ia];B[fa];W[go]
C[ans so on : now, the game is very difficult because you allowed white to completely destroy this group with B41. Anyway, the answer that you played is bad since if you connect at f5, white 48 is attacked and you have a chance that white wants to save it. If he does, you have to destroy his territory while attacking ; ok ?]
;B[fq];W[fo];B[ep];W[eo];B[dq]C[good idea to take the stone but how ? If you play 53 here, you should capture the stone!]
;W[er]C[var 2 is the sequence how black take the stone.]
(;B[cp];W[do];B[cr]C[does not capture.];W[fr];B[gq];W[hq];B[bn]

;B[gp];W[jq];B[in];W[kn];B[il];W[hm];B[im];W[hl]C[see what's happening on the lower right ? White is building territory while attacking : can you feel that is good for white ?]
;B[ik];W[hk]C[now, the only move in the board is the san san  in the lower right. You  escaped in the center, that is enough : you msut invade at r3 NOW]

))
(;W[fp];B[cj]C[This is the weakness of white W6,W8,W10 : B15 is a very good point to attack. It is a very good feeling i think. A fight will start and you must let W10 and W14 separated. If white plays in the center, Black plays b12, reducing the eye-potential of white. Please, try to see why l12 completely destroy the white's original shape.]
