C[Polocaty [5k\]: hi
blas [4k\]: hi

JS: Hi my name is JÃ¼rgen Suntinger and I am currently playing as a 2 dan according to my EGF rating. All my comments in this review will beginn with my initials JS.]

(;W[jo]C[blas [4k\]: I choosed this instead of o5 because I thought it was not good to sacrifice k3, and o3 aim the corner

JS: The aim of the black invasion at m3 is not to capture or attack the k3 stone. In the fuseki stage it would be unreasonable to begin small scale fighting when there is still so big open territory left to play. So the basic aim of m3 for black is to sacrifice it to close the right corner in sente, so that black is the first one occupying the next big point. So look at the variations.

JS: The move k5 does not really threaten the left black group, but also does not really capture the m4 stone. Every move you make should not be serving only one purpose, but several purposes, e.g. a move that attacks the opponent and at the same time stabilises the own position. That is why o5 is the move most played by professionals in this position.]

(;B[kp];W[kq];B[lp];W[jp]C[blas [4k\]: I think I didnt play wrong but I dont like the actual situation. I dont know if my fault has been done now or later

JS: White now is in a very comfortable position because white more or less has a base at the bottom and the group also looks into the center erasing the influence of the black wall. However the black corner is still open for an invasion at the 3-3 point, so black has achieved nothing, just strengthening the white group.]
;B[pj];W[qh]LB[rj:A][qq:B]C[blas [4k\]: Maybe was better to enter in his moyo
blas [4k\]: or to play r13. My idea was to make territory and after reduce his moyo

JS: This move seems very good. Black builded up a moyo on the right, but it is open on two sides. White now can slide to A to reduce this moyo by a lot, or white can invade at the 3-3 point at B.]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[kr];W[ms];B[jr];W[ir];B[hr];W[js]LB[qq:B][nr:A]
C[JS: Black sacrificed 3 stones for nothing, now white has clearly two eyes in is more than alive. But now White has a stone at A, which makes an invasion at B even more easy for white. You gained a minimum of 10 points (if not much more) just because black wasted his stones and made you clearly alive. You know groups which are 100% alive are the strongest base from which to attack, because you can be 100% sure, that they won't die. So white can continue very aggressively knowing she cannot lose.]
;B[qf]LB[qf:B][qh:A]C[blas [4k\]: All this play was bad for him. I dont  why at last I loose

JS: You can look at one position from two ways: The first way is: All of my groups are very weak, I have to save them and give them live, or let them escape fast into the center. This would be the way the "prey" would look at situations. Or you look at it the other way around: My stones are strong and they are building a foundation from which to attack. This would be the fiew of the hunter looking at a position.

JS: So white invaded your framework at B and it is your turn. Now comes the question: Do you want to be the prey or the hunter?

JS: If you think of A as a weak stone, you will run out with your opponent. But you should not always let your opponent do what he wants, and use your stones. Look at the variation.]

(;W[oh];B[of];W[nd];B[mf]LB[ld:A]C[JS: Just looking at the situatino now, your opponent has group running into the center, and white has two groups which need help. The one in the corner would be very unhappy black gets the point at A. But at the same time a week white group is struggling for live at the outside. So the black group is attacking two targets at the same time.]

(;W[rj]C[blas [4k\]: I try to make a base, to feel safe and after reduce the moyo

JS: The move at S10 is a very heavy move, which means that it tries to rescue the whole white group at every price. In Japanese this would mean "shinogi" It is very important to know when and what stones one can sacrifce.

JS:The right way to deal with weak stones is to make "sabaki", which means to always keep the option open to sacrifice them to get even more profit. Look at the variation.]
;B[rk];W[qj];B[qk];W[pi];B[oj];W[mh];B[ld]C[JS: Now Black got everything he wanted.]
;W[rd]LB[rf:A]C[blas [4k\]: I dont know if this is the best now

JS: this move looks very necessary, otherwhise the white corner gets into deep trouble. This move also makes it possible for white to connect his stones under at A as an emergency meassure.]

;B[ni];W[nh];B[rg];W[qq];B[rh];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[mi]
C[blas [4k\]: now his moyo is reduced, and i have only a weak group

JS: Yes, but you can already count -20 points because of the fact that you have one weak group and every group of the opponent is stable.

JS: However the position now seems a little bit favourable for white.]
;B[mk];W[cj]C[JS: Good move. This is a very big movem and also the last big fuseki point in this position, so white should have an advantage if the right group doesn't get into big troubles.]
;B[kh];W[ki];B[lh];W[li];B[kk];W[ii];B[jh];W[ji];B[ik]
(;W[hc]C[blas [4k\]: now I have towo weak groups but I thought that  the influence of my stones of the left would help me, and f17 is weak too

JS: Yes this looks playable for white, but it can get complicated because of the fact that white has two weak groups then. So for an easier continuation look at the variation.

JS: This is my last comment. Just review this game after this invasion. There was very much fighting and your groups started to becomming weak and you had to go living. Being forced to have to life with a group that was first not really weak is not a thing one wants to desire. One last advice: Moves which strengthining the own weak groups are much bigger then they look like :-).]

(;W[ih]C[JS: This move is called "one thousend dollar turn", or "magari" in japanese. One can feel, how this move strengthens the white group and reduces the moyo of black. If the moyo gets to big white still can think about invading or sharply reducing this.

JS: An advice which help me and my style of play a lot: Go is generally a construction game, not a destruction game. You should only start to destruct your opponent, when you have utilized most of your ways to build up your position, or when you counted that an constructive way of playing does not lead to winning the game.]
))
(;W[qj]C[JS: When you are week it is always good to attach to your opponents stones.]

(;B[qk];W[pk]LB[pj:A][qk:B]C[JS: If black playes a hane white can simply crosscut. Aftern this crosscut white is very like to capture one of the stones A or B. And capturing stones often lead to eyes, which would make the white group alive easily.]
)
(;B[pk]C[JS: If black dislikes the previous variation, he can nobi, but this lets white push several times on the 3rd line which is also building a base.]
;W[qk]C[JS: White can live easily now.

JS: So now you now another basic principle: When you are weak around, then attach to the opponents stones. When you are strong around, then keep a distance from your opponents stones to not give them any chance to make "sabaki". If you start some small scale fighting your opponent will always be glad to give you some little kandy to make good shape for his other stones.]
)))
(;W[pf]LB[pd:B][qh:A]C[JS: A and B form a line, so when your opponent tries to cut this line you should simply connect it, and let your opponent struggle for live on the inside.]
))
(;B[oq]LB[jo:B][lq:A]C[JS: For black I would prefer to close the corner instead of rescuing the stone at A. A is of no use because white is already very strong because of the stone at B. A general advice is to not play near positions where the opponent is already strong, this just strengthens the opponent even more.]
))
(;W[no]C[JS: This white move is forcing for black because it would be a too big loss for him not strengthening his corner]
;B[pn];W[kp]
(;B[oq];W[nr]LB[fc:D][nc:C][cf:E][qf:B][qj:A]TR[lq]C[JS: As you see white basically captured the marked stone, but black has sente to play the next big point.]
)
(;B[pr];W[lp]C[JS: this is another variation one can see in professional games.]
