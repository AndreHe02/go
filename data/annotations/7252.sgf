C[Despite how thoroughly I was beaten in this game, I really enjoyed it. I felt like it had good flow, and it might have been close if I had found a better way to manage my center group. Still, the fact remains that this was a very large loss, and I am hoping that means that there is a lot I can learn from it.

If you can, please try to overload me with theory, reading, principles, or whatever else you have to offer. It feels like it's time to get out of the kyu ranks already, and whatever help you may have for me will be appreciated : )

crux: Hi, I'm Bernd Schmidt, 2d.  I'm not strong enough to know correct play; so even if I give variations please keep in mind that there may be better plays.  My goal when reviewing is to give ideas about how to think about the game.]
;B[od];W[dp];B[de];W[pp];B[cn];W[dj]C[This move is interesting. I think my opponent has a pretty good whole-board approach, and as a result, he worked to break up my strategy. I don't know any joseki for this pincer, though, so I made do.]
;B[en]C[crux: Don't like this very much; I'd probably jump in the corner or make a second approach move.]
;W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[kq]TR[bp][cq]C[I felt that my group was resilient enough to leave, so I broke up his bottom. Is this assumption correct? If so, is this still a good time to play here?

crux: You don't have a good continuation, which is why I said I didn't like jumping out.  Also, it's probably better not to make the marked exchange, since it eliminates the possibility of a corner invasion without really giving your group stability.]
;W[iq];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[qm];B[dc]C[So far, I feel that the board is looking pretty good for me. White's two main groups have lots of aji for me to pounce upon, and my own groups seem fairly strong. However, I haven't made any territory yet, so I decided it was time for a shimari.]
;W[cg]C[crux: This is a wonderful move for White to play - extend from his single stone, and attack the corner territory in one move.]
;B[jc]C[Any response to White's move would just help him, so I worked to secure the top.]
;W[md]TR[od]LB[jd:D][je:E][qc:A][qd:B][qe:C]C[This move surprised me. I was expecting something more conventional, such as A through C, but instead White moved to break up my top.

With the stone on the fourth line like this, I am a bit puzzled as to how I should respond. Just trying to take the corner at A myself does not take much territory (and puts no pressure on N16). B fails to take the corner on top of mounting no pressure. White is looking at moves such as D or E to reduce my top, so I decided to give up the corner and attack.

Is this a correct assessment? Did I make the correct move in light of this assessment?

crux: I'd secure the corner with A.  The marked stone is closest to White's, and it doesn't have reinforcements nearby, so that's the one you should strengthen.  That indirectly puts pressure on White.  Besides, the corner territory is not small, especially if you get to extend down the side later.
If White plays D or E, that lets you convert the framework into real territory; that can't be bad for Black.]
;B[je];W[pd]LB[qd:A]C[I was expecting R16, but I don't think this move is that bad.]
;B[pc];W[qc];B[oc];W[pe]
(;B[qb]LB[nf:B][oe:A]C[This move concerns me. My emphasis until this point has been to surround N16, and strategically consistent moves would be A or B. However, playing those do not completely kill that stone, and they leave R18 open for White to make an easy twelve-point corner. So, I decided to count on my ability to cut N16 off and gain by driving it into the center.

Is this okay?

crux: I like this move; whoever gets it makes eye shape in the corner.  The question is whether you can push once at A in sente.]
;W[oe]
(;B[ne]LB[rc:A]C[crux: Play at A instead to secure the corner group and deny White any eye shape.  If he tries to connect, you can later attack the whole thing.]
;W[nd]
(;B[nf]LB[rc:A]C[crux: The ladder doesn't work for White, so I think A is still more important.]
;W[qd];B[mb];W[lc]
(;B[rb]LB[le:A]C[crux: This looks good, but have you read out whether you can enclose White with A?]
;W[lf]
(;B[nh];W[ph];B[lh]C[I wanted to leave aji on the top, so I decided not to lean against White's side to make shape before turning back against White's center group. Was this a mistake?]
;W[kg];B[ki]LB[nj:A]C[I was thinking about what would happen if White peeped at N13, and I decided that a stone was needed here to help things turn out well (please see the variation). I also wanted to drive White toward his group on the side so I could then cut them apart. Is this move too light against White?

crux: If you want to make shape and protect against the peep, A is the play, which also puts a bit of pressure on the side group.  The move in the game just provokes White to jump out, escaping easily.]

(;W[ig];B[hf]LB[gf:A]C[This move now feels like a mistake, because there was nothing I can do after this point that enables me to separate the center from the left. Might A have worked better?

crux: Neither this nor A seems important to me.];W[hg];B[gg]
;W[gh];B[fh];W[fg];B[gf];W[gi];B[ii];W[ih];B[eg];W[fi];B[eh]
;W[gk];B[bk]C[At this point, I decided that my bottom-left group needed some love. I know I don't play enough to live, but I think it's enough to get me started.

Is my center group more important right now? Should I have fully settled my group here instead of leaving?

crux: Whichever one you settle, the other comes under attack.  Probably the one on the side needs more attention.]
;W[bj];B[ck];W[cj];B[rf]LB[qf:B][qg:A]C[I think I messed up here. I thought Black can connect to either my corner or my center group, but if White plays S15, White is fine.

In light of this, is this move okay?

crux: This just seems to be on the wrong spot altogether.  No attack works at the moment since your center group is weak.  Once that is taken care of, things like A can eventually become interesting.  B is an important point for eye shape of the white group.
The game move looks like it's concerned with stealing a bit of territory by connecting out with a monkey jump, but that's way too small at the moment.]
;W[qg];B[qj]C[I am doubtful as to whether this is a good idea or not. I am making another group that needs care. I thought I could make both this new group and the center live, but now I don't think it was worth the effort.

crux: That's what, your third weak group in the area?];W[pj]
;B[pk];W[oj]
(;B[oi]LB[qi:A]C[crux: A terrible move.  Normally, you'd hope to play A at some point, threatening to push through and cut.  This move eliminates all these possibilities and weakens the two stones on the side.]
;W[pi];B[ql];W[pm];B[ol];W[mj];B[kk];W[ml];B[om]LB[km:A]C[This is where my mistakes reveal themselves. The center needs A to have a chance, and the right might need this move. I played here to be aggressive. Should I have played A? Or does the center still have a chance after White's next move?

crux: The crucial mistakes happened earlier.  Nothing to do now other than hope for the best.]
;W[km];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn];W[lm];B[in]LB[jl:A]C[Maybe A?];W[jl]
;B[jo]C[Here, I decided to throw away my center group and to make up for the loss elsewhere. I was low on time, and didn't count out that there is no way to make up for the ~45 points he secures with his next move.

Do I have any other options here other than resigning?

crux: Let's wait until we see White's next move.];W[il]LB[bq:C]
[gq:D][kl:B][nk:A]C[crux: Ok, this looks bad.  However, you have some aji around A and B.  The ponnuki is also very strong and could help you launch an attack on White's lower side group with points like C or D.  I don't think it's resignable yet.]

(;B[gq];W[gp];B[hq];W[hp];B[ir];W[ip]
(;B[jr];W[fq]
(;B[rk]LB[bq:A]C[What I really wanted was to continue attacking White's lower-left group, but I don't think I can really threaten his life. If I played A here, would White attack my left group?

crux: It takes some reading, but A may well be sente, and it is relevant to the eye shape of both groups.

If you want to reinforce this group, then rather than playing S9 which has little effect on White, you could try strengthening it indirectly with an attack on the corner.]
;W[ri];B[rm];W[rn];B[oo];W[po];B[ro]C[This is the result of a misread.]
;W[sm];B[qn];W[rl];B[pn];W[qo];B[on];W[rp];B[pl]C[crux: About one point in gote.]
;W[nj]C[White has 45 solid points in the center, 15 in the lower right, at least 4 in the lower left, a couple more on the left, and potential to make a whole lot more in the lower left, upper right, and left side. Black has ~34 points on the top, 7 on the bottom, 8 in the upper right, and a very shaky 5 points on the left. I am behind by ~13 points.

I could exchange B3 for B2, then play B14 to gain by 10 points or so, but then White can gain another 13 with S17. After those areas are resolved, there is nothing large enough to come back.

I believe I should resign here. However, I was tired, I was in overtime, and I could only tell that I was behind by a lot, so I finished the game. And I did it poorly... White gained about 20 points as it carried on.

I don't really have any further questions, but if you see anything worth commenting on, please do so.

Thanks for your help.];B[sd]C[crux: The upper left corner seems bigger.]
