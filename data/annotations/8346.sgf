C[I've made some comments through the game, but can you give me some tips if you see me doing a wrong move? Thx for reviewing my game :)



L: You are welcome and please tell me if you have any more questions about this review as this is my first and i may miss something or not explain things well enough. also i will mark my comments with a L to begin it. In addition i have made many variations so whenever you see a comment made by me there is probably a variation check it 

Some general notes overall:
you might want to work on trying to take some time and look to see what territory is being created by your opponent
also try to see what moves might gain you more points and pratice some go problems so you can be able to read ahead and be able to see if your area is invadable and if your moves can be countered

for those who may not know how to check variations below this text box there is a bar with a up and down arow on it. move it up and all moves are shown]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf]
(;B[md]C[L:here may be a little to much on the safe side because if white wanted he could play somewhere around h16or17 and put your bLack stone in danger a better move is shown in my variations]
(;W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[qf]C[L:better wouldve been to continue standard joseki at p5 then white would play k4 or k3 another option might have even been q10 because your area in the upper right is basicaly safe now]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pl];B[qm];W[pm];B[qn];W[oo]C[L: here you may have saved some territory but 2nd line territory isnt very much and white has gained a huge wall to get more territory in the bottom and the left]
;B[pn];W[on];B[qi];W[jq];B[dc]C[At this point everything seems to be good

L: I agree although white does have the huge wall which implies you should get to invading his huge moyo before he solidifies it]
;W[ic]
(;B[id]C[Is this the right move?

L: this i believe is ok for how white played but a better move might have been h16 to push him to where you are strong]
;W[hd];B[jd];W[he];B[ge];W[jf];B[kf];W[if];B[kd];W[kg];B[lf]
;W[lg];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh]C[L: This move is not a great move because it invites white to play n13 and take much of your already small teritory better might have been n13]
(;W[gf];B[gd];W[ff];B[hc];W[dj]C[Here i start to notice the shape he has around the middle and i decide to invade.

L: this is a very good thought however it wouldve been better do this earlier when white wasnt quite as strong]
(;B[lj]C[to be honest i dont know exactly what im doing the next few moves, i just try to reach the middle part but still connect those stones with the ones i have in the upper corner.

L: here this ends up working but if white were to play m11 instead he couldve just surrounded the territory and you would have no way to invade except the 3-3 point in the lower left a better move wouldve been something like m11]
(;W[jj]
(;B[nj]C[this move is maybe just a little bit to safe it wouldve been better to be more aggressive with something like m8]
;W[kl];B[kh];W[jh];B[ll];W[km];B[oi];W[oj];B[nk];W[nm];B[ol]
;W[om];B[hg];W[hf];B[ii]C[here you couldve easily been cut off but him playing k11 and you would have a very hard time making life with those 2 stones]
(;W[ij];B[hi];W[hj];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[fk];B[ji];W[cn];B[ki]
;W[kj]C[in this sequence you actualy manage to gain a lot however white was far too cautious if he had played a little more agresively you wouldnt have gotten nearly as much]

(;B[ln]C[L: here white couldve cut you with a simply move at m7 better is simply m7 or n7]
(;W[kn]
(;B[ag]C[L: here this is a gote move so it should wait until later a better move would be c3 because you can probably make life that way]

[df][bg]C[Now i see that the marked W stones can be captured. Even if he connects the triangle W stones with the Square W stones i will prevent him from making two eyes. Thats at least what i hope, but i dont succed. Some of the next few moves will be stupid because i start surrounding those stone so i can capture them instead of invading in "his" area. I try to do it without him notice my plan

L: here it may look as though you can capture him but white has many many moves he can make to get life see variations]
