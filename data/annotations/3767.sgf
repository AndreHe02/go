;W[dd];B[cf];W[fd];B[dh]LB[bd:A][dh:D][ci:B][cj:C]TR[cf]C[[Broege:\] I think that a move at A is more common as to limit the White corner. If Black chooses to extend B (or C if one is adventurous) is more standard. The move played (D) is too close to the marked stone.]

LB[lo:A][gq:B]TR[no][nq]C[[Broege:\] I would recommend A. White has to respond as the marked group is attacked, then Black has some more strength needed to counter the invasion.

As for immediate limiting of the invasion - perhaps B is a bit calmer - White still has to run and Black has no weakness.]
;W[hp];B[gq];W[jp];B[qj]LB[lo:A]TR[no][nq]C[[Broege:\] Why not run at A? White will respond by running with the marked group, then Black can take territory on the right side.]

what would the best way here be to gain center influence (i don't want to give white all the fun) without loosing as much of the left side as i did

[Broege:\] I think that F8 instead of G8 would be enough - White wouldn't try to cut at D8. See the variation at move 41.

As for now - perhaps A is worth trying as it protects the triangled group (and territory ) and leaves squared group in a position both to attack the B stone and to try connecting to C or running to the center. See the variation for more details.]

If the objective is to live in the center then beginning at A seems desirable.

If the objective is to enhance upper-right territory then a play at B (or C for ko) seems natural.]

C[[Broege:\] When trying to escape one has to make use of all the weaknesses in the opponent's position - either to escape or to make eye-shape.

Such a sequence may be A-B-C (already mentioned twice), threatening to capture the three stones (including B) and to connect to the side. When White answers C (i.e. at D) play at E forms a part of an eye.

Now it is probably too late to rescue the marked group (see the variation).]
;W[hh];B[gh]LB[fg:B][eh:A]C[[Broege:\] As the marked group is already dead it is best to make use of if from the other side, i.e. by attacking at A and then at B. This way Blacks makes some territory instead of giving more prisoners to White.]

[js][rs][ss]C[[Broege:\] There were a few mistakes made by both sides but they seems to somehow cancel each other. It is hard for me to point to a single losing move.

As a final note please read the following advice:

On tactical side of the game:

1. Don't invade when you can be immediately cut off.
Invasions made in places where the opponent is too strong to let you live and that can be easily cut off tend only to strengthen the opponent locally (and give them many prisoners).

2. Don't rescue dead groups.
Try to use dead groups to your advantage by threatening to rescue them (remember: always threaten from the side of the living group so the "threat stones" are safe). This way you can increase territory (or resurrect the dead group if the opponent makes a mistake).
Rescuing a dead group from the wrong side tends to only add to prisoner tally (see point 1.)

On strategical side of the game:

1. Don't try to over-extend.
Solid extensions give your positions more strength both to defend and to attack. They may look smaller but they allow you to take the initiative which in the beginning is more important than insecure territory. Try to remember that in the beginning there is almost no territory. Many strong players say that influence is everything (although I'm still to weak to feel that way myself).

2. Try not to create many weak groups. Your opponent will be able to split them and very often attack two of them simultaneously. More often than not you will have to sacrifice one of them to rescue the other. It may also happen that both the weak groups will die.]
