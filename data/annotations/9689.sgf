AB[pd][dp]C[[Agi\] Hi, I'm Aginyan from KGS, and will be reviewing for black. I'll be tagging my comments with [Agi\] throughout.


 igokichi30 11k+: Hi!
 mazoula 12k?: 604 hi :)


*mazoula: This game annoyed me from the start because I got a 2 stone handicap when I have been beating other 11k's on pandanet with no extra stones.  So I'm not sure what the ratings mean.  Apparently I needed the 2 stones for this game as I lost.  I'm mainly concerned about all the yose moves white ended up playing to secure her territory.  I don't understand the trade-offs related to early second and first line yose moves.  What counter play did I have or could set up to avoid giving my opponent most of the yose points?  I've had those early yose moves thrown at me by 7-8ks on kgs so this is not the first game where I have given up too many yose points in the opening and midgame.
     An explanation of any big moves my opponent and I missed would also be helpful of course.]

;W[fq]C[*mazoula I don't really understand when to pincer; so I try that here]
;B[hq];W[cn];B[co]LB[dj:B][ck:C][dl:D][eo:A]TR[cq]C[[Agi\] Up until now the game has been fairly tame. This is the first move that seems questionable.

This kick is used often to make white heavy when black has a stone around B to force it to run. Because it would be far too tight to play a far 'to tight' extension around D.  

In this situation, the C extension is still not ideal, but it's still nice and helps settle white's group on the left.

The first instinct is to split white at A. White has the choice to dive into the corner and live small, while Black gets to choose which side to block (left seems to be worth more btw). White living smal would give black thickness to secure the other side.]
;W[bn]TR[dn]C[[Agi\] And this is a decidedly odd response by white, apparently focusing on trying to live locally or try to sneak into the corner?]

(;B[bo]C[[Agi\] Black should not follow white to the second line, see variation.]
;W[ck]C[[Agi\] See how generally comfortable white is with this extension. Not alive, but pretty settled.]
;B[eq]LB[dn:A]C[[Agi\] This kick only touches a stone that black wants dead. Better to play at A and attack the stone from afar. White's group on the left isn't alive yet.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[ai]LB[bc:A][mc:B][qf:C]C[*mazoula and the eary yose point losses begin

[Agi\] These points aren't generally worth very much early on. Unless Black's group is in danger, it's worth considering where to tenuki. These sequences also leave black in gote, which is undesireable so early in the game with so many large points to play.

Here, I'd seriously consider playing A, B, or C in response. because sacrificing the 2 black stones is not a big deal.

Point A would help the black group live locally. B or C would be expanding and assumes black is willing to run with the black group later.]
;B[ah];W[aj];B[bg];W[ic];B[dn]LB[ej:A][el:B]C[*mazoula It looks like hitting the head of 2 stones cost me sente here; loosing me some points

[Agi\] This move doesn't have immediate effects on the white group, which is why white can choose to ignore. However, white's group is definitely getting weaker and ignoring this move can cost white later.

Once white is sealed in (around A/B) that white group can just barely make 2 eyes, and possibly just 1 eye if black plays first.]
;W[dm]
(;B[en]C[[Agi\] Black is being too passive here, see variation]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[lc];B[qd];W[ph];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp]TR[em][on]C[[Agi\] Black is being too territorial. white jumping into the corner is not worth a huge amount of points relative to something like the marked points]
;W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rr];W[mb]C[[Agi\] white seems to have figured out that all these 2nd line yose moves are essentially "free" points because black will respond to all of them in gote.]

;B[rc]C[*mazoula ga to that whole sequence];W[ao];B[ap];W[an]
;B[bq];W[bc]C[*mazoula What are the biggest moves here.  What strategy should I adopt?]
;B[qo]LB[pj:B][dl:C][on:A]C[[agi\] This move is worth all of 6 points if black follows up, AND gives black an empty triangle. 

Playing at A to expand the bottom,
B to reduce white,
or C to seriously threaten the white group's life, are easily worth more]
;W[rm];B[pn]LB[nn:A][kp:B]C[[Agi\] This move is developing too slowly. Plus it ends practically in gote for black because white's most obvious move leaves black almost in atari

Either go Bigger with A, or more solid with B];W[pm];B[on];W[kn]
C[*mazoula I adopt the strategy of let him split living groups; I'll attack the invasion, but i'm worried about where white and blacks frameworks will develop

[Agi\] The only flamework that's of importance right now is black's framework, that white just tried to reduce.]

(;B[io]C[[Agi\] Both left and right sides are 100% alive, white has a ton of points and if white can reduce the game is over. 

Black should be making legitimate attempts to kill the white stone while it is profitable to do so. Half-heartedly "attacking" is letting white off too easy.]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[km];B[em];W[dl]LB[el:A][kp:B]TR[jm][io]C[*mazoula I'm not sure whether to play at A or B here?

[Agi\] The problem with A is that black has been attacking from the left side the entire time (marked stones), A is simply redundant with K7 there.]
;B[el];W[kp]C[[Agi\] White is correct to ignore black's move because it does nothing against the white group.]
;B[lo];W[ko];B[lp]LB[nl:A]C[[Agi\] This move isn't effective. The point of peeping is to make white heavy, narrow, and hard to run with, and the peeping stone is often a throwaway because it's right up against enemy walls.  you don't want to add to the stone unless you havea good reason to.

Here black doesn't need the stone to live, isn't really denying white any eye space, and isn't preventing it from running.

Something like A would prevent the stones from running to the right side.]
;W[jq]TR[lq]C[[Agi\] Odd move by white, perhaps an attempt at making eyes w/ the marked point.. or connecting to F3]
;B[iq];W[om]LB[mm:A]TR[mb][fc][ic][lc][dd][sd][re][se][qf][ph]
[qk][kl][pm][rm]C[*mazoula white is developing a big moyo how should continue to play here?  Playing at A didn't work

[Agi\] but playing at A can separate white (though it is near impossible to kill quickly.]
;B[mm];W[ml]
(;B[dk];W[bl];B[cj]SQ[gg][fh][ei][fi][fj][gj]C[[Agi\] This move does almost nothing, black isn't expecting any territory  in the marked area.]
;W[nm];B[nn];W[mn]C[[Agi\] capturing this one stone is not worth very much to white since white already connected. Black should take sente and use it somewhere else]
;B[mo];W[ln];B[kd]LB[ni:A]TR[cf][ci][el][jm][io]C[*mazoula I try to develop thickness along the top to reduce white and develop blacks framework; but how should I go about it and is there a better strategy?

[Agi\] There's no real black 'framework' to expand at the top, only the left side (and it's largely neutralized by white's top and white's now-alive group in the bottom. A straight attempt to reduce white would probalby be more effective.]

;W[fe];B[gf];W[jk]LB[ff:2][jk:1]C[[Agi\] White always had at least these 2 routes into black's side, so black couldn't expect much]
;B[hk];W[ii]SQ[ph][jk][qk]C[[Agi\] White is doing 2 things at once, "reducing" black's framework on the left (except white had 2 entrances anyway. And more importantly, white is expanding the right side massively.]

LB[og:A]SQ[lh][mh][li][mi]C[*mazoula where is the best place to reduce white's potential territory on the right?  I try A looking to get as much of the space into my  moyo as possible.

[Agi\] With the black stones up top nearby, black should be able to reach deeper into white's framework.]
;B[og];W[oh];B[nh]C[[Agi\] inviting this cut can cause complications, unless that is part of the plan (white stands to lose more than white)]

(;W[ni];B[mh];W[mi];B[lh];W[li];B[ki];W[kj]C[*mazoula admittedly l11 doesn't seem good given i'm going to come back and play m16 because I'm scared of a white invasion from the top.]

If I had to summarize the entire game with one idea, it would be: Black is too protective of what he believes is his territory. 

This manifests itself in various ways,such as responding to white playing slow, inefficient, 2nd line moves early in the game, that lets white set the pace (and settle weak groups in the process)

If black is chosing to win the game using hard-cash early on, he needs to be able to stay ahead of white's points and reduce any potential frameworks that appear. Instead, white is the one locking in points to black's detriment.

Another manifestation of over-defensiveness is Black is also seeing frameworks that don't really exist and moving to cash in. If there is more than 1 real way to escape/run away from a framework, it's not worth much because it will take 2 moves to close it up. Note how few points black got around G13 and N14 for his trouble.

Black should be aware that there are 3 ways to "gain points" in go:
1) take territory (e.g. securing an enclosed corner)
2) make the opponent lose territory (invading/reducing)
3) do both with a single move (extending your own territory/framework while reducing the opponent's)

Finally, Black has to be more aware of giving up sente more. There are instances (such as M1, or E8 or C10) where black just gives up sente without thought, and each one costs him many points in white doing something valuable. Giving up sente will happen during a game, but one should not give it up without a good reason or need.]
