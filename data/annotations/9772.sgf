C[Hi,

This is Wonodan from KGS, I'll be starting my comments with W:, and I aim to review for both sides.

My KGS strength is around 2d-3d.

-Wonodan];B[pp]C[hi, i need some help with this game, how to deal better with invasions. in the end my opponent stole like everything from me and i could not get enough for it]
;W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj];W[nq]
(;B[lq]C[W: This is the most common response, there's no doubt about that.]
;W[qq];B[qp]C[W: Correct direction.];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo]
;W[om]LB[nl:A][pl:B]C[this invasion feels very early and maybe overplay-like to me but its always hard to me to punish it in the right way.

(I moved the comment back one move, as I felt the timing for it is better here :-))

W: It should be noted that Go is about exchanges: Here there was an exchange of territory for power.

White took territory in the corner, while Black got influence on the outside. Black does not have any points yet, but Black has more outside influence on the board than White. This means fighting in this area will be more favorable for Black.

Black would be happy if White invaded Black's influence. Here Black is happy to use his influence for fighting in an area where he's stronger than White. This is what influence is for - attacking invaders, not trying to claim your influence as territory.

There are two strategies for Black to try here:
A) Try to close White in, gaining more outside influence
B) Try to steal White's base while gaining points

Since Black already has two out of White's three escape routes blocked, I'd aim to close White in with A.]

(;B[pl];W[pm]
(;B[np]C[W: The threat of White cutting here was not that bad, Black could sacrifice the three stones in order to build magnificent thickness. See variation.]
;W[qm];B[ql];W[ol]
(;B[ok];W[nk];B[nj];W[mk];B[mm]C[W: Great move with great timing!]
;W[nl];B[mj];W[ll]C[here i thought i managed to get another wall to make some territory on the upper right while he stil has a weak group running. unfortunatly he just comes in again now

W: Your upper right side does indeed look nice, but you need to take care for the bottom group which is in danger of getting surrounded.]
;B[lj]C[W: This move is an attack. Think of it as an attack. If your opponent ignores this attack, show him it was sente and he should've defended! :-)]
;W[oi];B[oj];W[qf]C[W: At this moment you have a weak group, and your opponent has a weak group. The top right stone is not in danger of being closed in.]

(;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]LB[jl:A]C[W: Locally these are the best moves, there's no question about that.

The problem is that the fight in the middle is still unsettled, the one to move there first will have the upper hand.

If White gets to jump at A (k8) before Black for instance, the seven Black stones below become weak and a target for White to attack.]
;W[qi]LB[nd:3][qe:1][pf:2][qh:A]C[is he already alive?? if so, then he already destroyed all my potental

W: I'd strongly advice you to forget this kind of mentality where you only think about points and killing the opponent's groups.

When you played the joseki moves you already accepted that you would take the corner, and White would live on the side. If this was not the result you were aiming at, you should have pincered at A (r12) instead. However, that would've given you an even worse result.

As mentioned earlier, the fight in the center is more important than this area.

Why does White's group need to die here? You get ~30ish points in the corner, and White will probably 10 points max. In terms of points, I'd say Black is the winner in this area.]
;B[rf]C[maybe the wrong idea?];W[rg];B[re];W[qh]
(;B[jm]C[W: This lets White off the hook, as it's relatively simple for White to slither out.]
;W[jl];B[il];W[km];B[jn];W[jk];B[fq]C[after a few attacking moves i saw new potential for territory on the bottom, so i approached here... and he comes again immediatly. grrrrr.]
;W[hp]C[W: White's playing style is indeed overplayish. Black is stronger (has more stones) in this area, so it would be best for White to just protect the corner instead.]
;B[fo];W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[dn]C[W: Excellent sequence. 

Brilliant play by Black. 

You should never let anyone surround your corner stone like this, but White ignored two of your attacks and you were able to completely close him in the corner.]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[gm];B[gl];W[eq]C[W: In Go you need patience.

Again, don't try to kill White's corner group, you should be happy to close him in. That's reasonable enough.]

(;B[cq]C[it feels like he has 3 weak groups now, but i didnt punished it in the right way obviously, need help here :)

W: At this point it should be enough to keep his groups separated and closed in. Prematurely playing on the 3-3 point gives White the opportunity to resist.]
;W[fr]
(;B[cp];W[gq];B[fp];W[dr];B[go]C[W: This kind of move should be saved for aji or ko-threats, you're only fixing White's weaknesses and making his group stronger, while losing liberties which are vital in fighting.]
;W[ho];B[do];W[jq]C[suddenly he is settled but at least i stole his corner...

W: The corner is not important, but the balance of power outside. If you had closed White in the corner, fighting would favor you outside.]

;B[qj];W[qk]C[W: As a conclusion, I'd say you were too concerned of making points with walls and influence. Influence and walls are made to force your opponent into invading. After your opponent invades, you need to figure out how you want to benefit from your influence and walls. 

Usually there are two different options:

A) Attack while gaining points
B) Attack while gaining power/influence/wall

If you can not benefit from your attack (by gaining points or influence while attacking), then you should not keep attacking aimlessly but instead leave it for later. After the whole board position becomes different, suddenly an attack that was not worth it before can become effective.]

(;B[rj]LB[sh:B][ri:A]C[W: This move would be your strongest attack against this White group. White can't make an eye on the edge with A (s11), because you can make an false-eye with the placement at B (t12). White can still live, but his group will be smaller and you might have better endgame moves in this area thanks to this move.]

(;B[ge]C[W: It would've been better to play here instead. Make sure you can connect when reducing your opponent's territory.]

(;B[nb]C[W: In any case this is an excellent move which is a defensive attacking move. You keep all the points in the corner, and you force White to defend his three stones at the top. In other words, you get a good move like this in sente.]

))
(;B[lk];W[ml];B[kl];W[lm];B[jn]C[W: I believe this is the best sequence for Black, as shown before.

I stress that Black does not try to kill White, Black is only surrounding White in order to get more influence or fighting potential in the center, while White must really struggle a lot to be able to pull off two eyes in this cramped space.

Black does not care if White lives with 2 points here, the outside influence is worth much moce than that.]
))
(;B[lk];W[ml];B[kl];W[lm];B[jn]LB[lj:A]C[W: I would not hesitate to close White in like this. When you make an attack (A at m10), you have to make it count. If you attack your opponent, make sure you have a good followup. Since White did not answer your attack at m10, you make White pay the price.

Please note that Black is not looking to kill White. Black is only trying to surround White, preventing White's access to the center. Black's surrounding attack was a great success.

While White struggles to make two eyes in this cramped area, Black's groups will become strong as steel. Don't miss opportunities like this to turn the game around. The game strongly favors Black here.]
))
(;B[ml];W[ok];B[pi]LB[ml:A]C[W: I feel A (n8) is the correct direction to attack from. White's group remains heavy, and while White struggles, Black automatically gains points on the right side. And strenghtens his weak group at the bottom.]

;B[rn];W[rp];B[nd]LB[nn:A]C[W: Don't worry about the cut. The amount of points White gets in the corner can't possibly amount to anywhere near the benefit Black gets from his outside thickness.

A White cut at A would not do White any good either.]))
(;B[nl];W[ol];B[nk];W[ok];B[oj];W[nm];B[mm]C[W: Black is not concerned about whether White can make two eyes or not - that's absolutely irrelevant. Black is just very happy to close White in on such a large scale this early in the game. The thickness Black gains from the walls will benefit Black throughout the rest of the game.]
))
(;B[jd]LB[qn:A]C[W: This is one of Michael Redmond 9p's favourite openings. He is prepared to fight in the bottom right after White plays another pincer around r5 (A). The reason he likes to play like this is mostly psychological, he does not want to let the opponent feel confident (most players would respond to O3).]
