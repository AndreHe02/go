C[Hi ! This is my game played versus a 11k on OGS. I play White.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ed];W[df];B[hd];W[oc]C[This smells like trouble. He can now put pressure on your stone in his sphere of influence and strengthen his position while you have to run. I think it is too early for such a move. Better play save like somewhere around O4. Even around Q10 is better, because it is save and you can develop without being pushed around.]
;B[mc];W[qc];B[qg];W[jc]C[I didn't know where to play. L17 and L16 seemed to me good to. I wanted to attack the stone on N17 and keep it disconnected of H16.

This move is too aggressive. If he stretches to N15 you have 2 weak groups. Even if they both live, you will have to give the opponent too much other stuff for compensation. It is better to Q16 first and put pressure on his group and at the same time strengthen your two stones group and make a way to the middle. Depending on what he does you can still go K12, because your P17 group now is much stronger.]
;B[me];W[je];B[ch]C[This move is very bad from him. It makes so sense at all. His stones on the right are not connected yet. He must put pressure on you there and strengthen his own position. Because if his right side is not strong, his E16 stones can be a target to your attack.]
;W[eh]C[Maybe I have to play in another place ? I wanted to try, but something like H17 seemed to me good too.

Q16 is urgent in my opinion. You play this, just because he played there. You follow his lead instead of thinking about your own goals. D14 grp can easily live in the corner, no need to take care about them now.]
;B[ck];W[cn];B[db]C[Beside the urgent moves in the right upper corner, there are still bigger moves. K4 or Q5 for example.]
;W[cb]C[Better ignore and take the urgent/bigger moves];B[ce]
;W[de];B[cf];W[dd];B[ec];W[gc]C[Here, I didn't know at all where to play to try to kill the black group. Once again, maybe H17 was better.

H17 would make him more solid. But also this move is too aggressive. Go H18, make your group stronger and chase him out in the middle. He will have a running group and you can solidify K17 group than attack his stones on the right side making your still weak P17 group save.]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[id];W[jd]C[If you don't want to go J17, why play G17 in the first place? This makes his group brutally solid.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[jb]C[Starting now,I think there is nothing I can do to pressure black.I think H19 was useless.]
;W[kb];B[hb];W[ja];B[gb];W[dc];B[eb];W[gq];B[oe];W[nb];B[dg]
;W[bc];B[po];W[qj]C[I wanted to cut his potential territory, but I'm not sure that was the best place.

He has played some good moves and has now a huge influence on the right side. You should really have come out with the R17 group. But now this move is okay, to take away some of this potential.]
;B[ql];W[oj];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd];W[rh]C[if you played S18, you should follow up with Q18, otherwise just ignore S17]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[mb];W[ma]C[I'm pretty sure now that Q18 was definitly better.

Yes]
(;B[pb];W[pc];B[qb];W[ob];B[sb];W[pa];B[ra];W[oa]C[My bad. I definitly hadto play M19.]
;B[la];W[lb];B[na];W[hf]C[This is not a real KO threat is it?]
;B[if]C[I am very lucky I think, if black played N19 that have been very difficult  for me.]
;W[ma];B[pi];W[ka];B[pj];W[ph];B[pk];W[oi]C[This not good. Leaving a good cut for black. Your R12 grp is very weak. Run towards the center! Forget about one stone at P10!! A quite unimportant stone.]
;B[oh];W[pg];B[pf]C[o13 would be trouble];W[og]C[but now you can break out.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[mh];W[ne];B[nf];W[mg];B[mf];W[lg];B[mj];W[of]
;B[nd];W[qf];B[pe];W[rf];B[ok];W[lh];B[li];W[mo]C[Don't push too hard here, since black has a solid wall. Go K3. It gives you secure territory and disturbs blacks influence.]
;B[lq];W[mq];B[lp];W[mp];B[iq];W[lo];B[jp];W[kp];B[kq];W[ko]
C[Not so important to protect that one stone, since black is already quite solid and he would have to kill in gote. So better run to the middle making some eyespace. Now you have some quite heavy stones hanging around in blacks influence.]
;B[eq]C[too aggressive. He should go J6.];W[ep];B[fp]C[F3!!! F4 is a gift for you.]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[hp]C[E2. Don't destroy your own aji.];B[hq];W[er]
;B[ho];W[go]C[I don't see what you want to achieve with this stone? You realize H4 only has one liberty don't you? It is time to leave this place and make some urgent moves. For example running with the N4 grp.]

;B[ii];W[jj];B[ij];W[jk]C[Ireally wanted to kill these stones.

This is almost impossible since H14 is very weak and can be killed. But black let your 3 weak groups connect, which is good for you.]
;B[fh]C[g12...];W[gh];B[hh]C[G10 and don't see how white can live...]

C[Here start a fight to kill the G9 group,and maybe the group at J4 ! but I failed.

Yeah not a good spot to start a fight! Make good endgame moves and you win easily, because black made the huge mistake with the J12 grp.]
;B[dh];W[ek];B[fl];W[el];B[fm];W[dl];B[dm];W[cl];B[cm]C[why not B7??]

;B[kn];W[lk];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[nk]C[bad move for endgame, because you voluntarily end in gote without gaining anything. Only wasting a very decent ko threat.]
;B[nj];W[ll];B[lj]C[also a bad move.];W[rk];B[qi];W[ri];B[rl]

Not a big problem. Gote anyway for one stone.];W[jg];B[re];W[qa]
;B[rb];W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[nc];W[na]C[Don't fill it now. This move is worth Zero. There are still points on the board.]
;B[od];W[lc];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[fe]C[it's a bit late !

no, you can do it even later. O4 would be sente at this point. K1 is also quite juicy.]
;B[fd];W[ef];B[ee];W[ff]C[only woth 1/2 points. There are bigger points on the board.]

Thank very much for watching my game !

You played very well! In close games like this, the endgame decides the outcome. So take your time to look at the board when it comes to endgame. Don't be so quick to fill up 1/2 points KOs and other useless stuff. Always look for the big Sente moves.

Also don't act too quickly in the early game. The biggest mistake you can do is following the oppoent everywhere without thinking about your own goals. Sometimes even if it feels natural to follow the oppenent, take your time to think. Is following the opponent urgent? If not, look for the urgent moves on the board. If there aren't any. Look for the big points. Big points are typically in the middle of your and your oppnents sphere of influence and are save to play. Don't be too aggressive at the beginning. Usually it is not good to attack before you have secured all big points.

Hope I could give you some inspiration with my review! Good Luck1!!!]
