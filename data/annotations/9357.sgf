C[Hello,

Date of the game: 2014/02/27.
1 hour by player + byo-yomi of 15 stones by 5 minutes.

This game was an official one, played during the second round of the first qualification stage of the French Championship 2014 at Antony between my friend Philippe (4k) as black and me (3k) as white. Komi is 7.5.

You can comment anything you want about both sides since I will send the review to Philippe.

About me:
- I'm currently trying to improve my fuseki, but I don't like the one of the game: I felt behind during most of the game, even if it was still playable. What do you think about the fuseki and my evaluation of the game?
- Consequently I played more agressively that I used to in official game, in particular during the chuban. Did I overplay somewhere or was it ok? Was the overall strategy ok?

I added lots of comments in the game to explain my thinking at the different points of the game.

Thanks for you comments!
Julien];B[dp]C[Hi, 
First thing i want to say that i really enjoy this game, full of surprising moves. So i'm glad to be able to review this game.
Second, In the game I belive Julien took some time to count, I don't know what Phillippe think but possibly he also count. But you consider in points too much without noticing the power and the combinations of stones, and misjudge the aji. So sometines you feel you're behind but it's not, you're feeling to be ahead but it's still hard to say. That's the point
Last one, I'm not native speaker, so sometimes i don't choose the right words to express myself or make some funny grammar mistakes. Please forgive me.]
;W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[nc];W[kd]C[I don't like Kobayashi, so I prevented it...]
;B[qc]C[But neither I like the variations when black does sansan in this overall position :-(.

:)];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[qf]LB[og:A]

(;W[nd]C[O16 's very solid, it erase the aji of O17 completely. But it's little bit slow, that is the price you have to pay. Depend on are you a solid or agrressive player. I suggest you another option]
;B[ce]C[I already felt behind, even if it was still fully playable of course. I will have to be patient in this game...]
;W[fq];B[dn];W[jp];B[qn];W[po]C[Don't like to play against Kobayashi, but ok if I play it :-).]
;B[rp]
(;W[qo]C[But I don't play it for months, so I'm not sure of my variation.]
;B[ro];W[ql];B[pn];W[on];B[pm]C[this move is terrible for b
you know that this is not a good shape right?

and keep in mind that the aji of w s7, when he defended at r3]
;W[om];B[pl];W[qq]C[Since to be ok (?)];B[pf]
(;W[hc]C[I wouldn't like a black move around here. So I played it first.

Big move!
but how about playing f5 first]
(;B[ol]C[For B , if you want to keep this area. R9 is the best]

(;W[oi]C[Reduction move to check black answer.
Questionable. You help B to kill precious R8 stone];B[qi]LB[nl:A]
[dr:B]C[Solid as expected from a student of Fan Hui! Black is ahead in term of points.]

(;W[nl]C[So I choose to develop my influence. My stone at P11 has still potential and will limit black moves here.]
;B[nk];W[ml];B[oj]C[Now w kill his r8 completely]
(;W[dr]C[I hesitated to play a move around K7 but, after counting, it seems to be not enough (between 10 and 15 points more) since black will add another big move and white still have plenty of aji here (so I'm not even sure to make points here at the end).

Finally, The bottom left part of the board seems to be the more important one to my eyes because that's the only part where black is not strong and white has potential.

The natural exchange of white F5 for black D2 seems good for black here because the white move does not develop so much its moyo and black adds a lot of points while he is already ahead. So I played D2 first]
;B[fo]C[Good sense]
(;W[hp]C[White makes points while black doesn't, but it looks overconcentrated.

Maybe C3 better than H4?];B[dj]C[Look like a very big move!]
;W[cl]LB[cj:A][cl:B]C[Black ahead, white solid almost everywhere (not so much at the top though). It's time to destroy black potential.

Attacking here seems to be the best good point because I can expect either to live on the right side or to attack the bottom black group. "You must always have at least two plans ready", Dai Junfu told me!

^___^ I feel C8 overplay. There's no way you can attack 3 stone of black strongly with a weak running group like C8, in addition you help black run into your moyo while he got a nice move C10. Now b's surely leading. and you don't need to take time much to count, just count the questionable moves.
B made a mistake in the joseki at the bottom right, and a little mistake at Q14 since it's not sente and not gain much. 
Now w turn: you play P11 and O8 then perfectly help black correct all his mistake, then play D2 wrong direction and again C8 make weak group your self helps b gain point. so what b need to do now is playing careful to put pressure on c8m every moves b add, it will reduce the moyo]
;B[cj];W[el]C[So it's time to attack black.

3 black stone stronger than it look

and, you can't call it an attack. For me, c8's more like "running"]

(;B[gl]LB[fk:A][co:B]C[I have to say that I was surprised by this very strong move. I expected something cooler like G7.

At this point, I consider to play the second shown variation that sacrifices the white stone, but I counted that it was not enough to win (maybe it was still playable though since white got sente). Maybe it would have been better if I played C5 before E8?

G8's too much for black]
(;W[fk]C[So, after reading that the hardest variation didn't enclose white as far as I can read, I decide to continue the ongoing fight. After all, it was one of my initial plan.]
;B[gk];W[fj]
(;B[eh]C[Even if it looks big, it seems like a mistake to my eyes (the first black one?). First, playing here instead of D12 leaves weak points in the black shape. Second, I think it was the wrong direction: I expected black to continue to attack strongly with a move like H11.]
;W[gj]C[Even if I consider that I am still behind, I tried to keep cool and played strongly.]
;B[gp];W[gq];B[ho];W[io];B[hn]C[This sequence seems good for me: of course, black is stronger now, but it is still not fully alive, while white has sente again and only one white move at K7 will now fully enclose my territory.

I counted that this move was still to small right now. I still has to push further to remove black points.

B's group is more heavy now];W[cd]C[So now the top left... Not easy to attack because black is strong while my F10 group is still floating and my top group is not as strong as it may look.

After reading a lot (I read at least variations starting at D13, D14, B15, D18 and C17), I consider that this move allows white either:
- to leave in the corner without destroying too much the top white area; or
- to destroy points around C13, and escaping by connecting around H17. It would certainly put a lot of pressures over my F10 group, but since the G8 black group is not so strong it should be ok; or
- maybe to connect to the F10 group by capturing either C10 or E12.

Surprising move. I don't expect this];B[dd];W[be];B[bd]C[but now i have to say E12 is in the perfect place, so C16 not work, (i'll explain later) but i appreciate that creative thinking]
;W[cf]C[let consider without E12]
(;B[de]C[But now there E12];W[eg]C[what is the best answer here :)]

(;B[dg];W[dh]C[Sabaki is your friend in the opponent area!]
;B[ef];W[ei];B[fg];W[di];B[cg]C[Philippe told me that it was not what he wanted to play initially but he already pressed the clock...

:) too godd for w, now c8's strong, it means b have to take care of D4 himself]
;W[bh];B[bg]C[I consider this to be a white success... :-)]
;W[bn];B[bi]C[I hesitated between B6 and B11... Not sure that I made the best choice because B11 is so big. Actually I misread at this point since I though that I can still capture C10 and D10 :-(... Anyway I wanted to continue to put pressure on th F5 group.

time pressure is bad, you 2 make a few mistakes later, but sad for B, the more he tenuki, the bigger he suffer the loss]
;W[co]C[too bad for b, his group becomes weaker and weaker]
;B[jc]C[I didn't expect black tenuki on C5! But it seems very hard to tenuki on K17 too... And it actually really difficult to answer with such a black power on the left and the aji of O17.]
;W[kc]C[So I played here. I considered that playing at K16 would be either too dangerous for my P18 group if black split me; or black would get too much points if I simply connected since the power of my wall would be pretty useless. Maybe I was wrong since F5 is becoming weak.

answer here is good choice, if w still has sente to come back to punish D4 tenuki]
;B[jd];W[je];B[id]C[What a nice black shape :-).];W[ie];B[hd]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[kb];B[ic]C[Even if black got points here, I'm happy with this black potato! :-)]
;W[he];B[ge]C[Better at G16 maybe? (some aji here with the cut at G16).]
;W[do]C[Now I have to prove that the black tenuki was a bit overplayed: attack!

good enough];B[ep];W[fn];B[gn];W[en];B[cq]
(;W[dq];B[cp];W[cr];B[br];W[bp];B[bq];W[jm]C[At least, I got the C2 yose and this very big endgame move :-).]
;B[eo]
(;W[dm];B[ik];W[hj];B[jl];W[im];B[hk]C[Better at J8?];W[kl]
;B[kk];W[lk];B[ij]C[Actually, I expected black L10 instead of J10. Don't know which one is better.]
;W[pi]C[Anyway, since I don't know which direction is the best one to continue my attack (J11 or L10/L11), I played elsewhere.

I have still to reduce black points and the last big black area is the top right. It is time to use my P11 stone! Q11 or R12 seems to be playable. Don't know which one is better! Already in byo-yomi at this point (Philippe too), so no time to think a lot about that.]
;B[pj];W[qh]C[I was ready to sacrifice the Q11 stones to invade the black area.]
;B[ni]C[What a surprise. I expected something like Q12. Philippe told me that he was affraid by its weak J10 group.]
;W[ri]C[Ok, so Philippe lets me destroy its points. Even if he was right, that's good news for me.]
;B[qj];W[re];B[qe];W[rj];B[mh]C[He was still afraid by its weak group

Yes, sad for black. he had to be aware of his weak group all the time, that's is the result of misjudge the power or weakness of the group. and due to the time pressure too, i can see that b's not in the good condition when his time run out. The game's practically over here]
;W[rm]C[Then time to get life inside his territory.];B[rn];W[rf]
;B[qk];W[rk];B[qg];W[rg];B[ph];W[rh]C[Yeah. I feel ahead now for the first time of the game!]
;B[md]C[So now it's time to attack for black.];W[mc]C[Since I feel ahead in byo-yomi and a bit weak here, I decide to played very solid.]
;B[lc];W[mb];B[ne];W[ld];B[od];W[nb];B[ke]C[Yeah. Difficult cut and no time to read very deep and to count. I don't know if I can save these 3 stones or if I can sacrifice them.]
;W[ii]C[So I decide to attack again the weak black group. It should help me to save my stones.]
;B[ig]C[Whaouh. I don't expect a tenuki at this point, even if I don't read deeply if my previous move was fully sente...]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[ji];B[ki];W[jk];B[eq];W[er];B[kk];W[lj]C[Blacks seems to be dead my dear Philippe ;-).]
;B[fm];W[em];B[fl]LB[ek:B][hm:A]
(;W[hm]C[Maybe I could have let black gets life (see variation) and I win anyway? But, without thinking, I played the killing move.]
;B[ek];W[bk]C[Actually, I didn't know what I read, but I think I can connect E11 and B9. What a mistake!]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[fh];W[ej];B[dk];W[ah];B[ch]C[At this point, I realized that I can't connect and I also forgot the G7 cut. Stress + byo-yomi = really bad play!]

;B[gm];W[lh];B[mi];W[le]C[M12 connected! :-)) So black died?]
;B[ap];W[bo];B[bm]C[But Philippe is ressourceful.];W[al]C[Tsumego in byo-yomi is really hard (at least for me)... I found this tesuji...]
