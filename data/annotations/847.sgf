C[J: After my blunder at 146 its nonsense but I'd appreciate comments up to then please.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ce];W[ed];B[ef];W[jc];B[fq]
(;W[cn]C[bridges: D6 may be better here, because then C10 is definitely better than D10 later.
];B[fo];W[dj]C[bridges: This is in the right direction, though I probably would have prefered it at C10 instead of D10. As I said earlier, I might have prefered C6 at D6 to get a good balance as to high and low stones.]
;B[ch];W[nc]C[bridges: Not a bad approach, though I would probably have played something around L3 instead, because it invades the bottom where black wants a big territory, and allows a two-point extension either way. Still, L3 may end up getting cramped, and this was not  bad at all.

On this approach, note that it is a three-point extension from the K17 stone. This is fine for white, even though it leaves an invasion point at M17.]
;B[oc]C[A thank-you move from black. This asks white to play O16, covering the invasion point he had left at M17. White should jump for joy at this move.]

(;W[qn]C[bridges: Instead, white leaves it. This is a mistake, as black will illustrate for white later. :)
Again, I would have prefered L3 or O3 to this approach. There is lots of space on the right side for white to come in to later. This move (R6) only forces black to make a large bottom side territory and remove some invasion points.]
;B[qo]LB[pn:A][rn:B]C[Again, Q6 is the standard move for white in this position, because otherwise black can play at A or B.]
;W[qk];B[jp];W[de];B[df];W[pg]C[bridges: what exactly was the purpose of this move? My guess is that it is a territory move that seeks to limit the size of the black group at the top, but with the weakness at O16, thisis not effective. Also, if you've aiming for territory, the third line is better.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[pf];W[rf]C[bridges: This move is fairly small. Hane-ing at the head of two stones it not incorrect, though P14 seems bigger than S14. If white has O16, P14 is a nice move to seal in black and build good thickness.]
;B[re];W[rg]C[bridges: Even though white has a clamp at S16, black is correct to leave this position. There are bigger points on the board]
;B[pn]C[bridges: And black chose a good one. Notice that this move serves multiple purposes: It is sente against white's right side. It pushes white's right-side territory flat, and it increases the size of blacks bottom moyo.]
;W[qm];B[mp]C[bridges: Black's bottom is looking very large. However, white has three medium-sized territories on the board, and if they stand up, they may be okay. White should looks for ways to increase his moyos while limiting blacks. Moves like O16 are still good.]
;W[rd]C[bridges: This clamp is fairly small still. P14 and O16 are both larger in this part of the board. Attacks against the top left black stones are also probably larger.]
;B[qd];W[se];B[rc];W[qe];B[pe];W[re]C[J: In retrospect this seems a waste of time.

bridges: yes.];B[nd]C[bridges: Another illustration why O16 is the right response to the attachment at P17. black pushes white flat and gains thickness.]
;W[mc];B[ob];W[md];B[nf];W[gf]C[J: I considered O13 but didn't like to play alongside

bridges: G14 is okay, though I probably would have played G15 instead since it has a better relationship with the white stones at the top left. This could let black weasel his way into white's top.]
;B[nm]C[bridges: Black continues to increase the size of his bottom moyo.]
;W[eh];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[dg]C[J: this starts an abortive attempt to kill

bridges: This is not necessarily a bad idea. If you can deprive black of eyes, then you can chase this group around the board while increasing the size of your top side and left side moyos. If he lives and you seal him in to a small territory, this is also a success.]
;B[cf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ci];B[bh];W[bi];B[fg]C[bridges: Black can make two eyes by playing at B14 but because of his large bottom territory and the lack of any really thick white positions, he decided to run toward the center. White should happily chase his while increasing the size of his top and left territories.]
;W[ff];B[fh]C[bridges: A nice move by black.];W[dh];B[eg];W[af]
C[bridges: Even though you can remove two eyes (and do), chasing black is more profitable, since black will likely be able to connect this group. If he doesn't, then he has to spend moves making eyes directly, and by sealing him in, you will have helped your own territories.Moves like F10, F11, and H12 are all better here.]
;B[bf];W[ae]C[J: ??

bridges: This does keep black from making two eyes, and so is not bad. (Otherwise, black can play A15, making two eyes. Still, chasing or enclosing black while increasing the size of your moyos is bigger, since black should be able to connect easily.]
;B[ac]C[bridges: A waste of a move by black. There are not two eyes there.]
;W[ee]C[J: another wasted move?

bridges: Yes, I think so. It does reinforce your top somewhat, but there are bigger moves that do so. Black has played A17 and given you the opportunity to chase him around. Do so.]
;B[hh];W[lf]C[J: this starts to expand my territory but the following moves leave black with a huge amount of space. Would expanding from the right or left have been better? Would I have been better making the bottom left safe?   Alternatively is there any way to invade the bottom / right? I'm not good at invasions.

I really had no idea of which option to follow

bridges: This is a hard question. White has slowly gotten himself in trouble by letting himself be pushed flat in several places. F9 or F10 seem better, I think. I don't dislike this move, however. It seperates H12 from the right side while increasing the size of the top. Next, white can aim to come out near F9 or10, continuing to chase the black stones on the left that have only one eye if black doesn't respond, so this is sente.   Invading the lower right will be difficult but possible. I've included a few variations to illustrate how it might happen.]

(;B[gk];W[mh]C[bridges: This move is particularly unfocused. Its is not a stong attack on the stones at the top, which can make two eyes easily, and black can counter it while continuing to surround the middle, or black can attack the still somewhat thin left side directly (see variation for the later).]

;B[qp];W[rp];B[rq];W[oh];B[nh];W[if];B[hg];W[hf]C[J: all this seems less important than the bottom left in retrospect? Or is there any point encroaching around k12, l12?

bridges: H14 in particular is pretty small. L12, etc. helps reduce black's territory. Moves around E8 are pretty good because otherwise black can play around there to try and reduce white. D2 secures the corner, and perhaps gives white some opportunity to reduce black there.]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[jg];W[jf];B[kg];W[lg];B[ki];W[eq]C[bridges: I think I would have prefered D2 to this.]
;B[fr];W[ng];B[mf];W[me];B[ne];W[kf]C[bridges: Much too small.]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[cq];W[dr]C[J: I had no idea what to do about B 107 but I'm fairly sure this was not it.

bridges: If you think you can kill the C3 stone, D2 is the right way to start. However, because of the surrounding black stones (the F2 and F3 stones in particular), it is unlikely that you can kill black. Better to play C4 and keep what territory you can.]
;B[cp];W[co];B[cr]C[This is in fact why white can't kill here. If there weren't black stones at F2 and F3, then black could be killed with the hane at B4. With those stones in place, however, black has enough help to live fairly easily.]

;B[bo]C[bridges: Black finds the correct move to live.];W[bn]
;B[ap];W[cs]C[bridges: Black seems alive here. Accept that and move on to bigger points. Moves like C1 can be big ko threats later.]

C[J: This blunder finishes it. I should have politely resigned immediately.

bridges: These things happen :-) The game was still somewhat close at this point, though Black IS ahead. Though the black corner invasion cost white some points, it gave white places to push into black's bottom side.  Black has one large territory that white can reduce somewhat now with moves like G2, and moves like O18 finish several medium size territories for white.]
