C[This game is commented by Nicklas Ekstrand, NicklasE on IGS (9k) and NNGS (5k). Black asked me to comment on this game on the Go Teaching Ladder.

Make sure that you follow all the variations (I have _not_ pointed them out).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
(;B[fq]C[I usually play this move at D15.];W[ce];B[jc]C[I guess B is afraid of the very good position for white where he gets to play around k16. But getting a position on the left and attacking the lower left corner could also be considered.]
;W[hc]C[This seems to be a slow move by w but it may also introduce a moyo-play.]
;B[je]C[I guess I would have played K15 as well, although I don't think it is very good. There is still to much aji in the upper right corner and w might very well get a position where the K17-K15 stones are on their own.]
;W[qj]C[Yes, this would have been very big for B. W has no such big move to make.]

(;B[qd]C[Is this maybe to slow? How about R7 or R13? There is still too much aji between the upper two black groups.]
;W[qg]C[I think the exchange was good for white.];B[dr]C[I think black should play from the other side making sure to get a position on the left side of the board.

In ay case the D2 move seems very inefficient. K4 maybe?];W[cq]
;B[eo]C[E5 is playable but now good. I think B should make sure to get eye-shape and then move on to play on the left side. This approach by B is good if there are B stones on the lower side and B is aiming for a big moyo.]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[fo]C[This is a good cut. But it is very hard to say if it works since all stones are very weak in this position.]
;B[en];W[go];B[co]C[It always gets complicated after a cut.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[cr];B[hq];W[do];B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm]
;W[bo];B[gm]C[Well, I guess black will learn to cover cutting points after this :)]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dl];B[el];W[dk];B[io];W[qn]
(;B[qo];W[pn]C[The attach at R5 is not good since it gives white very good shape with the 3 point extension.]
;B[np];W[he]C[Hey, now it is time for B to count. What does he need to do about the left side?

W left side about 70 pts?
W right side about 20 pts?

B upper side 40 pts?
B lower side 60 pts?

But this is very optimistic counting. There is still very much aji. Whites left side still possible to invade. Lower right is possible to reduce significantly. White may invade around M4? Around N16 black is still very weak. The white stones on the right are strong but may be used as target to strengthen the Q16 stones?]

(;B[ek]C[What is the point with this move? B will get essentially no extra territory or strength but W will get more territory and strength for the left side.]
;W[dj];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj];W[of]C[I think W should play in the center and make sure that B doesn't get a big moyo.]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[me]C[B should be happy. Now there is less aji on the upper side.]
;W[mf];B[eg];W[cg]C[B should be even happier. He has now less aji on the upper side and has reduced white's left side.]
;B[mn];W[nm]C[I think both players are responding to friendly. For example, what is the point with O7? Securing points? Well I think black is securing more points :)]

   White = 101 territory + 13 captures + 0.5 komi = 114.5
   Black = 81 territory + 19 captures = 100
White wins by 14.5.

A lot of points :)

If white had played in the center at the right time black's moyo would have been very reduced. The lower right could have been more succesfull for white. Black should have aimed for a position on the left side. I liked the move by white on the upper side where black's position got very reduced. I guess the D7 cut won the game for white since black didn't know how to handle the left side. Then they both made mistakes but I think black's position got really bad after D7.]
