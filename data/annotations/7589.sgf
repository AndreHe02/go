C[GP: Hi, I'm Graham Philips (topazg) a British 1k and KGS 1d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can, and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf.]
;B[qd];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[ce];W[cg];B[ed];W[dd];B[de];W[ee]
(;B[ec]C[E14?

GP: Yes, E14 is joseki, although there are a complicated set of possibilities on this line (see variation for most standard). This is acknowledged to be a mistake, and I've put the punishment (starting wE18) as a variation too. There are just too few liberties to play this way.]
(;W[bd];B[db];W[cb];B[eb]C[GP: This exchange is too slow to take gote, it just doesn't get enough points. Only worth playing if the kill works, but now wD14 ends the fight, so this is only worth the 6 points for saving D18.]
;W[df]
(;B[cd]C[GP: Aji-keshi. Leave these liberties for later. For one thing, you remove the ability to play B18 this way (see variation).]
;W[cc];B[be];W[bc];B[fe];W[ef];B[hd];W[ff]
(;B[ge]C[GP: Very small! This is the sort of move you have to remove from your game. The only reason to connect F15 is A) to keep the Black group alive, or B) to keep the White group unsettled or dead. As both groups are unconditionally alive, this will never be as big as tenuki at this stage in the game (see variations).]
;W[hg]C[GP: This is a poor choice of move by White. There are much bigger moves, such as approaching at P16 or Q5. Certainly, the top left corner has been a poor result for Black - E17 was overplay, but you correctly identified a better alternative, and G15 was too slow.]
;B[cn];W[cl];B[bh];W[bg];B[cj]C[GP: This sequence is overplay. The idea of using the aji of the dead stones to help the invader is sound (though you would be better off doing so without C6 in place, as it allows you to pick your corner approach depending on how White responds), but now you just have two separated Black groups and White is already settled in the top left. With this stone in play and C8 absent, White would immediately play C8 to attack your groups, so forcing White to keep black separated like this just encourages White to attack strongly.]
;W[ck]C[GP: I would prefer D8 to this, makes it automatically hard for Black on both sides.]
;B[ej];W[dm]C[GP: Too slow by White, gives Black good opportunities to make White heavy.]
;B[cq]C[GP: Good choice, and timed well.];W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co]
(;B[gj]C[GP: A brave tenuki. I think I would choose F3 here, as it both gains immediate cash and also forces White to worry about his group still. However, if White caps here it is severe (see variations). I think this is a slightly painful tenuki to make, but probably the right decision.]
(;W[eq];B[er];W[fr];B[ds];W[gq];B[fl]C[GP: Very solid and safe, but also too small and slow. F7 will work fine from E10 and G10, and the group is no longer in danger after G10. White's potential for points in the F6 area is not as big as the remaining edge and corner moves.]
;W[po]
(;B[np]C[is this a good choice ?

GP: Nothing wrong with playing here. Following joseki, it should neutralise White's bottom side influence with E3-F2-G3, although you will still have to concede the lower right to White. R5 is also playable, for much the same reasons.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[oq]TR[or]C[GP: P2 is a must!];W[rr];B[kq];W[ql];B[jc];W[od]
(;B[mc]C[is P17 better?

GP: Yes, you've already taken away White's good extension with K17, forcing a magic sword type sequence. White's going to get a reasonable result, but Black should be able to cash a lot of points here.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[pd]TR[re]C[GP: Reducing your own liberties. wO17 is an obvious way for White to protect himself in sente. Better to play S15]
;W[nc];B[md];W[oe];B[re]TR[qf][qg]C[GP: Far too slow. The lack of liberties due to playing Q16 makes this understandable, but even so it isn't necessary. You can simply jump to R13 here, or, if paranoid, R14 is solid and safe. Dropping to the second line in this position is just asking for White to press you into the edge. This move alone will have cost you at least 10 points of the 15 point margin in the game.]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qj]C[GP: A very painful sequence for Black, playing along the second line in a previously unclaimed or contested area is normally a really bad thing.]
;B[ri]
(;W[qi];B[rj];W[rk];B[mf]C[GP: White should have taken this point at 78, rather than matching Black on the edge. This is an excellent move!]
;W[ij];B[gg];W[gf];B[hh];W[gh]
(;B[gi]TR[hi]C[GP: Better just to play H11. You are going to end up in gote anyway, and if wJ13 bK12 still runs out nicely, and is equally threatening to swallow up J10 as White can't push and cut (see variation).]
;W[fg];B[ii];W[ng];B[nf]C[GP: Never push unless you intend on cutting :)]
;W[of];B[mg];W[mh];B[lh];W[mi];B[li]TR[bj][iq][pr]C[if i play J13 to stop white, my opponente can rescue his J10 stone...

GP: This is true, but I'm not sure why the J10 stone is important. At this stage the center is little more than dame. However, bJ13 is met by wJ14, so that doesn't help you much either. This move seems strange to me. Not only is it pushing behind and giving White at least as many points as Black, but it doesn't seem to achieve anything that particularly helps your position. I would be tempted to take a move that picks up solid points. You can play J3 or Q2 as very worthwhile moves I think, and you can always play B10 saving B12 and threatening to save C6.]
;W[nn];B[mj]C[GP: Good! White should never have tenuki'd. This is very big.]
;W[nh];B[lk]C[GP: Makes sense with the idea of capturing J10 in a big way, and you give yourself good opportunities to reduce White further.]
;W[jg]
(;B[ih]TR[jj]C[GP: This move I simply don't understand however. Playing an empty triangle here doesn't achieve anything, and does it with poor shape. If you are worried about wK11, wedge at J13 instead, leaving White a forced cut to defend in sente, and allowing you to follow with K10 if needed. However, even this move seems aji-keshi. You can't cut outright, and threatening to isn't achieving enough. I would simply play K10 here - all you need to do is to guarantee connection and White has no further threats against the Black group.]
;W[kf]C[GP: A good active defence by White.];B[je]TR[hp]C[GP: This would be more effective if Black had pushed at J13. Either way, this feels much smaller than swallowing J10 up in a bigger way. How about H4?]
;W[ig]
(;B[ji]TR[jj]C[GP: Another empty triangle, yuck! Again, just play K10 and White cannot cut, and you threaten to capture the stone with the next move. Even if White tries to run with J9 he just makes himself heavy as the cut at K11 _still_ doesn't work for White.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[gm];B[gl];W[hm];B[il];W[fm];B[ip];W[hl];B[hk]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[gp];B[hq]TR[hr]C[GP: Another empty triangle! This shape really is so bad that you will rarely find circumstances where it is correct play. Jump to H2 here instead.]

;W[pk]
(;B[on]C[GP: An interesting exchange idea! If it wasn't for the fact White can capture with M10 later, this would have been a nice swap. As it is, there are good central points for Black right now. Simply connecting at O8 threatens both this and further reductions by creeping at Q7.]

[nq][br][cr][lr][nr][as][bs][cs][ks][ls][ms]C[GP: That was a really good game to send through for review. I didn't really comment on the yose which was generally fine, as most of the key points that decided the game were based around shape and standard local continuations (running fights and corner joseki sequences)

*** Important points to take from the game ***

* Opening: Every time you finish a game and you weren't sure whether you played the corner in the right way, look up relevant joseki lines that you could have chosen on http://brugo.be/. The top left (E17 instead of E14), top right (pushing and allowing yourself to be squeezed along the second line) and bottom right (P3 instead of P2) all suffered from a lack of joseki understanding, and in both cases you suffered a fair amount locally.

* Shape: Go is all about playing efficiently - achieving as much as possible with as few as possible moves. There are a number of positions where you played moves that cost you a few points simply with inefficient shape (Q16 in the top right, H3 empty triangle, J12 and K11 empty triangles). http://senseis.xmp.net/?AStaticTreatiseOnShape has a good amount of reading material on shapes that are good and bad, all of which are very important to pay attention to.

* Following locally: Evaluate how much an actual move is worth. Either a) it settles (or partly settles) a weak group of yours, b) it threatens or kills a weak group of your opponent's, or it should build you a strategic objective. Either picking up points _without_ giving a followup to your opponent that picks up as many, or reducing your opponents potential for points. A few of your local moves were either small compared to other moves on the board, or were simply not achieving anything substantial for your game (for example, G15 and M11). Quite often you played the last move locally for a few points, when globally there were much bigger areas to develop in (G15 being a prime example).

*** To take to your next few games ***

Remember to check out your corner sequences after each game for a while. Eventually you'll start memorising typical shapes and sequences, and also why they work / are worth playing in the way they normally play out. In this game, the three corners (except for the bottom left) cost you a lot of points that you were unable to recover from. You have a good eye for sensible areas of the board to develop, and if you can get the local sequences playing out on even terms you should get some good results against players of the same rank.

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]

(;B[oc]
(;W[pd];B[pc];W[qe];B[qc];W[nd];B[mc]C[GP: This seems ok, with lots of bad aji for White and a very reducible right hand side. With the left hand Black group so solid now I would be tempted to play this way as it is simple. The game looks roughly even here. Black is ahead on the board, but White has a number of points from influence depending on how he can develop the right hand side. Very importantly, Black has eliminated any very weak groups, allowing Black to play aggressively to limit White's expansion. With the ability to connect out to G10 or the top or the bottom, it is hard for White to counter-attack a deep invasion on the right hand side by Black.]

(;B[bb]C[GP: This sort of clamp works on 2-2 points quite often, because the liberties in the corner cannot properly be reduced.
