AB[pd][dp]C[KiraBox [12k\]: hello
oregonusa [10k\]: hi gg hf

[KB\] It's been 4 months since I've played online Go, and miraculously I won! I'll do my best to relate my thoughts here.]
;W[pq];B[dc];W[qn];B[cf];W[jq];B[pj];W[qg];B[nd]C[[KB\] I feel this move may have been a bit passive, but it feels like a good move.

Ted: If you were going to play at Q10, you should have responded by strengthening that stone first.  Something like R8 is a light base.]
;W[og]
(;B[jo]C[[KB\] My hope was to begin walking towards my loose stone.

Ted: I don't think that's the right idea.  As a general rule, if you've got one weak group, you don't want to go and create a second group.  You should still try to create an eye on the side for the Q10 stone by playing something like R8]
;W[mp]
(;B[qf]C[Ted: Attaching to an opponent's stone generally works to the benefit of the person whose stone is being attached to.  In this case, you're making White shore up his weak group, while also putting pressure on the Q10 stone.  At least if you had played from the other side now, might be able to help the Q10 stone.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[rj]C[Now the Q10 stone is a mess.];B[qh];W[ph]
;B[rg]C[Ted: R11 connects fo Q10, and keeps White split.];W[qi]
;B[rh]C[Ted: I don't think saving the R12 stone serves any big purpose.]
;W[pi];B[oj];W[qj]C[Ted: You should thank White for this unnecessary move]
;B[dn]C[[KB\] This felt better than D6 because of K5.

Ted: I'd still look to do something about the Q10 group.];W[ck]
;B[ci];W[bn];B[bl];W[cl];B[bm];W[cm];B[cn];W[bo];B[bp]C[[KB\] Ladder in my favor!  :)

Ted: I see a semeai, not a ladder.]

;W[ld]
(;B[me]C[[KB\] I feel this was an inefficient choice. Better at K17 to deprive white of a base.

Ted: I think you're right.];W[id];B[hd];W[jc];B[ie];W[je];B[ic]
;W[jd];B[if];W[lf];B[le];W[ke];B[kf];W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[mg]

(;W[kh];B[lg];W[ih];B[hq]TR[jo]C[Ted: Every time I see two stones like this, my first thought is that they're just begging to be split.  That having been said, splitting isn't always right, but I think it's a good idea here.]
;W[ip]C[Ted: I should point out that I wrote my previous comment before looking at White's next move.]
;B[hp];W[io];B[pm]C[[KB\] I was unsure how to use this group of stones.

Ted: Try to connect them above, and then reduce White?  Note that a White play at N16 is still problematic for Black.]
;W[qm];B[mi];W[pn];B[pl]C[[KB\] I feel this was the wrong direction.

Ted: I'd agree.  Either way, though, White still gets P6.  I don't think Black is that badly off, however.  Play something like E11 and make White run with the group on the left side, which doesn't have two eyes yet.  E11 also helps expand Black's territory in the top left while meking the center more equal.]
;W[ln];B[hn]C[Ted: I look at this and think White should peep at H5.]

;W[ja];B[dj];W[el];B[ek];W[bi];B[bj]C[Ted: Confine White to the side.  It's not necessarily a bad idea to make your opponent live small while you get substantial territory on the other side.  This just leaves you with a bunch of cutting points.]
