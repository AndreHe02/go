;B[pd]C[I'm playing as Black

Miron Brezuleanu:  Hello, I was assigned by the GTL to review your game. My comments will be prefixed with "MB:" from now on.

MB: I notice there is a fair amount of comments in the game already, I will try to cover what they don't.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp]C[I've been trying to play a faster fuseki game (by faster I mean focusing more about getting my stones across the board that securing early territory)]
;W[nd];B[of]C[hmm now looking at this I don't really like it that much. I think it's too high

MB: I think Q10 (or thereabouts) is better.];W[mf]
(;B[nc]C[White was passive so I decided to take the corner]

(;W[mc];B[oc];W[ed]C[This seems to be just a pass so I finish my shape

MB: This does look a bit slow (though not exactly a pass).]

(;B[pj]C[MB: this looks reasonable.];W[dj];B[kc]C[I take advantage of the agi here

MB: I would have played at K10 (or around it). This looks like a moyo contest. By playing K10 you get ahead in the 'moyo race'. If you can build a larger moyo, do that instead of invading. The point is to get them to fight in your moyo, on your terms.

MB: I would have simply played N18 locally. But I still think K10 is better (imagine K16 or L17 AFTER K10, if they don't defend). If they defend, you have plenty of other spots to invade and your moyo is still bigger, so you also have the option to keep building instead of invading.]
;W[ic];B[mb];W[lc];B[lb];W[kd]LB[jd:A]C[I should have played A here but I read the sequence wrong

MB: I'm not very happy with A either. The whole sequence seems to be played too early.]

(;B[be]C[I wanted to try the submarine trick I just learned

MB: The moyo contest is still on. Building a bigger moyo is preferable to invasion. K10. (Broken record, I know).

MB: K10 also reduces their moyo, always prefer reducing to invading if it's enough to keep the potential territories balanced.]
;W[cg];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc]C[MB: White's empty triangle could have been avoided by playing this at D18, for instance.]
;B[cb];W[db];B[ab]C[He chose influence and I take the corner]
;W[hq]C[I anticipated this invasion but i wanted to protect the left side before I 3-3 invade]

(;B[jq]C[DecimoKing [7k\]: submarine
DecimoKing [7k\]: ok];W[hp];B[cq];W[dq]
(;B[bp];W[cp];B[cr];W[dr]C[I should have played B5 and take away more of his left side]
;B[ar];W[bo];B[ap];W[ao];B[bs];W[qn];B[qo];W[pn];B[np]C[MB: This looks OK, the problem is that white can run towards the center.]
;W[qk]C[I never know how to punish this contact play

MB: that's life :-) Just contain him.];B[qj];W[rk];B[rj];W[oo]
C[KEITH064 [8k\]: brb];B[op]C[KEITH064 [8k\]: back];W[nl];B[nj]
;W[ng];B[og];W[oi]
(;B[oj];W[nh];B[pi]C[MB: Q12 seems like better shape here (avoid the empty triangle).]
;W[no];B[ld];W[md]C[Here I was way too passive]
(;B[jc];W[jd]C[Now I'm trying to reduce white's center

MB: reducing white center is done most effectively with K10. K10 also prepares to attack the O8 group (when you attack, they'll run towards K10, even if they escape, they will help you build a wall facing their territory, which will then be easily reduced). The point is not to kill by attacking, but to make profit (in this instance, by reducing their territory).]
;B[cf]C[MB: This is rather small. K10.];W[dg];B[le];W[kf];B[df]

;B[lj];W[jj];B[ki];W[ji];B[lg]C[Here I think is my best move in the game]

(;W[kg]C[MB: white defending at M14 is bigger for them, IMO. White just handed over a lot of stones.]
;B[kh];W[jh];B[lf];W[ke];B[mo]C[
MB: No comments after this point.

MB: One thing to try is to stop worrying about the other guy's moyo if you can build a better one. Moyos are for fighting. Whoever invades first is at a disadvantage (they have to fight on the moyo owner's terms, getting under attack and giving the moyo owner influence over the rest of the board). Make a bigger moyo to convince them to invade first. So if you can't build a bigger moyo, consider reducing. If reducing doesn't work (the potential territories are still way off balance), only then invade.]

C[And the end result was that Black wins by 3.5 points. I feel that I played a good game but I played passive at some parts. If you could give me an idea of my play style, strengths and weaknesses, you know stuff like that i'd really appreciate it. Also, I really need some help on reducing a moyo early on it would really help my game THX!!]
