C[Hi

I was playing black in this game.

This is a game where I feel I played well, but still lost badly. I think I came out of the opening well, but got completely outplayed in the middle and end-game.

After reviewing my game, I am at a complete loss as to what I am missing, or where I went wrong.

Any comments would be much appreciated.

Regards
Mark (SaurusDNA)


R:
Hi, 

I hope my review helps you a little. I have no special advices as I didn't see any special problems that were repeatidly committed. Maybe you could read Lessons in the fundamentals of Go and Direction of play. 

Wish you good luck with your Go.

Here, I was completely undecided between c3, f5 and , c6. Not sure what my strategy should be here. Where should I be aiming to make territory or thickness?

[kq:C]C[Is this too slow?

R: Yes!  A, B and C are the big areas here (sorted by size)]
;W[cn];B[bm];W[hn]C[Slow move for W];B[ip]C[Kikashi or aji-keshi?

I thought this stone would be helpful if I played q5 later.

R: Bad. J4 will not help you as an extension from q5 q3 combination. This is plainly bad sente. You might have possibilities here later on which you're erasing with this move.]
;W[hp];B[qk]TR[hn][hp][hq]C[Maybe q5 straight away, or was it good to force white to invade here?

R: The Chinese is for influential games, but W is already strong here diminishing your potential with the chinese opening. A corner enclosure looks more honest here. If white invades he has clearly the advantage.]
;W[qo]
(;B[po]C[Was this the best option? I played this because it seemed consistent with the j4 stone.

J4 is not strong J4 is weak and worthless. Q5 is the wrong direction here. I like A a lot better here.]

LB[rp:A]C[S9 feels very slow, but my goal was not to make territory, but to chase white, making thickness or a wall, so I played it anyway.

R: Possible although W is almost alive. (W has one secure eye at A)]
