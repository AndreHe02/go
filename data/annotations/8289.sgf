C[Hi
I'm Anand and I'm about 12 kyu on IGS. This was a very up-down game, with both of us losing big groups in the late middle-game. In the end my opponent bungled up the top left (where he could've got a seki) and lost by 2.5 points.

I would like comments on

1. Opening.
2. Direction of play
3. Advice on how to attack
4. How to reduce/invade frameworks.

Thanks in advance for the review.

*********************************************************************************************************
Hi

I'm Saurus, 3k on KGS, and I will be reviewing the game for the black side. I will mark my comments with "Saurus:"

You played very well in this game, and got yourself into a totally won position fairly early on. You really had no trouble with the opening or direction of play, and clearly have a proper grasp of attack and defense, and the principles thereof. Your invasions and reductions were excellent. The questions that you have asked above are not problem areas for you and really do not need much commentary, although I have mentioned specific moves where these could have been improved.

It is fairly hard to review a game that you won easily, since it is difficult to say that moves were 'mistakes' when they led to a better position locally in the game. As such, I have rather commented on the things that you may not be aware of, bringing to your attention issues such as shape, lack of consistency of moves, and incorrect mindset in places.

I have commented on each specific move where I think you should have played differently, but I think you should pay special attention to the following...

The reason why you lost your large lead (and nearly the game) is due almost exclusively to:
a) An irrational fear of losing stones (even worth one or two points) at the expense of sente or other big moves. You should make a special effort to avoid this type of conditioned/reflex move. This is critical if you wish to improve.
b) An unwillingness to accept when stones are dead, and giving up more and more points by continuing to play where your groups are dead, hoping that your opponent will make a mistake. This type of play will also seriously hinder your improvement in Go. Richard Bach wrote "There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn."

Most importantly, you need to realize that stones should be seen as currency, and can (and should) be traded at any stage where even more points can be made.

I hope you enjoy the review and find my comments useful.

;B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[co]C[This was a strange move, I'm pretty sure this is an overplay.]
(;B[dp]C[Saurus: This feels a bit odd. I would probably have played d2 first to make shape.

[See variation\]];W[eq];B[cn];W[bo];B[bn];W[cr];B[bq]C[On reflection, is C4 better?

Saurus: No, b3 is fine. White cannot cut at c4.];W[br]
(;B[ar]C[This kind of seemed small but I was worried about A3.

Saurus: A2 was indeed tiny. 

W-a3 would be as good as a pass. White can only live in gote with the two stones if you tenuki.

[See variation\]];W[dn];B[dm]C[To prevent getting shut in.

Saurus: Yes, d7 was forced.];W[en];B[cm];W[eo];B[cp];W[ep];B[ao]
C[Saurus: Overall, I think black did well in this corner. It was white's corner to begin with, and black came out of it with an even result. Black can be happy with this.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[nn];B[fc]C[Saurus: Good!];W[hc]
(;B[cc]C[Taking profit. I wonder if jumping out at F15 and counter-pincering is better?

Saurus: I played out the standard pincer sequence [See variation\] and I think it ends up about just as good for black as c17. Both are good - matter of personal preference, I guess.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[ce]C[I think this is aji keshi and not good for white.

Saurus: Indeed. However, you handled it incorrectly and actually made it worthwhile for white. See next two moves for comments...]
;B[be];W[df]
(;B[cg]C[Saurus: This is a mistake. B-c13 leaves a ko threat at b16/b14, allows white to push you along the third line, and kills the aji of the hane at d13. More importantly, it is inconsistent with your next move... This move says "I'm going to take territory on the third line", and then on the next move, after w-d13, you tenuki.

The correct play in this position is almost always b-b14.

[See variations\]];W[dg]
(;B[nc]C[Making a corner enclosure and trying to negate W thickness.

Saurus: Hmm....

The idea is OK, but white has the powerful w-r8 now. I think r10 was more urgent. Furthermore, r10 is an extension from q16, so it is a dual-purpose move.

[See variation\]]
(;W[ch]C[This seems small for W, since lower side is unimporant. However I get sealed in.

Saurus: I agree. White should have played r8.

[See variation\]];B[pj]C[Saurus: An excellent move!];W[bh];B[kp]
C[I was a bit worried about W moyo on the bottom side. So I decided to pincer/invade. Is it a good plan or should I build up my own moyo?

Would high or low pincer be better? Also since W has a two stone wall basically (O4 and O6) I thought a two space pincer is better.

Saurus: I think this invasion was necessary. Low pincer would be bad, because black would have to live small (difficult as is) and white would build up awesome influence on the outside.

I think your invasion was perfectly placed.];W[bf];B[bd]C[Saurus: This is proof of the bad aji left behind by playing c13 rather than b14 earlier.]
;W[ip];B[kn]C[Saurus: Good!];W[jo];B[ko];W[nl];B[pl]C[Continuing to jump with L8 is better?

Saurus: Yes, absolutely! You have no weakness on the right, but the L5 group is terrified. In a fight, safety is sooooooooo much more important than territory or "big" moves.

L5 will struggle to live now.];W[kl]C[I'm now worried about my L3 group. White's thickness everywhere is huge. I think W should have killed this group somehow. Can you give a good plan of attack for W?

Saurus: In general, groups are hard to kill. You should always expect a group to live, and play as if it will live. If you kill it, it's a bonus. However, I will comment on white's moves and mistakes for the next few moves as well. 

This move however, was the correct move for white.];B[jm]
(;W[jl]C[Saurus: Each contact moves chases black one move closer to connecting, gives black one or two extra liberties, and makes black stronger. White should have played j9 here.

[See variation\]];B[im]
(;W[em]C[Saurus: W-h9!

[See variation\]];B[il]C[Saurus: This contact move is good, because it is a defensive move.]
;W[ik]
(;B[gl]C[Saurus: H9 (defensive contact move) should be played first to force good shape.

If not, white can h9.

[See variation\]]
(;W[fl]C[White touches my stones, I'm happy to make good shape.

Saurus: Aaagh! White should not allow black to make shape!
White should h9!

It is all these contact moves that allowed you to live!

[See variation\]];B[hk];W[ij];B[fk]C[Saurus: Now black's group is starting to feel alive.]
;W[ek];B[fm];W[el]C[I was hoping to get one eye on H8 and one eye on the side, luckily I got 2 eyes on the side.]
;B[hp]C[I have heard that when trying to live, use contact plays.

(;B[jq]C[Not sure if this was necessary.

Saurus: Not necessary.

[See variation\]];W[fj];B[qq]C[Defending the corner to take profit now that I lived on the side.

Saurus: q3 is equally secure, and a much better way to defend.]
;W[gm];B[gk]C[This was small but I lost concentration here.

Saurus: In the middlegame, sente is everything. A move such as this can lose you the game.]
;W[gj];B[hj]C[Saurus: Doh!];W[hi];B[hl];W[lc]C[Saurus: Wouldn't it be nice if black played L17 first!]
;B[nj];W[qg]C[The invasion. I was pretty sure this would die. If not, I'll get thickness to reduce W.

Saurus: Good idea.];B[qe];W[ri];B[rk];W[ok];B[oj];W[og];B[mg]
C[Saurus: All of your attacking moves have been good so far.]
;W[mh];B[nh];W[ng];B[mf];W[ni];B[oh];W[oi];B[ph];W[mi];B[pi]
;W[rd]C[This surprised me. Is there any way I can kill W? In the end I was pretty happy that he lived in gote.

Saurus: I believe you are asking the wrong questions. I think your mindset is wrong here for two reasons:

1) You can't have everything! It would be foolish to believe that an entire moyo becomes territory.

2) If you cannot read out the EXACT sequence to kill, you must assume that a group will live, and play accordingly. How often have you watched pro games, and think that they could easily kill a group, but then they don't even try. This is because if they fail, they will be much worse off than if they didn't try. Rather, they try to attack such a group and make profit elsewhere.

See the next few moves for suggestions...];B[re]C[Saurus: Good strategy - cut the white groups into two. Now, you should kill ONE OF THEM!]
;W[qc]
(;B[pb]C[Saurus: You can't have everything. Pick a side you KNOW you can kill.

Consider how many times you could ignore this...

[See variation\]];W[ka];B[hs];W[gs];B[is];W[fr];B[ak]C[I lost concentration here after killing the large group and lost my own large group.

Saurus: This is just crazy play. The monkey jump is to destroy territory. This part of the board is not white's. Furthermore, monkey jump makes no eyes, and even detroys potential eye space. You should only ever monkey jump from a living group, and only to destroy territory.

What is wrong with b-c9?];W[ck];B[bj];W[je];B[jf];W[bl]SQ[bp]
