C[Hi,
This game was played on DGS where I'm 7k and my oponent 6k. I was white
 and lost by resignation after two of my groups were cut and died.

I think this game shows some kind of weekness in the way I play. I 
often feel late in territory so I build week groups which are easy to 
attach and cut. From here, games become complicated and I do many 
errors.
Maybe you could have some hints on what to do to improve ?

So I'd like to focus on big mistakes I did and maybe some well known 
moves/tesujis I would miss.

Thanks for the review


om3: Hi youshe,

I am a KGS 3k and my name there is om3, which I'll also use to mark my comments.

Looking at your game I think that your self-analysis is already well to the point. Your play seems often a bit unsteady and "breathless", leading to many weak groups. It's not so much fancy Tesuji that you miss, but more the simple, solid moves. Note that if you see a move, which clearly increases your thickness while leaving your opponent weak, it's almost always worth playing, as it gives you a basis for later fighting. So my general advice would be that you should learn to appreciate the value of Honte. One way to learn could be by studying professional games and focusing on the moves when they actually take time to defend their stones.

Since I am only about 4 stones stronger than, please take my advice with a grain of salt. However, in the review I also tried to clearly state where I myself feel a bit unsure about the analysis, as well as the points where I am confident.

[gq:b]MA[cd][qp]C[om3: I wouldn't call this a big 
mistake at our level, but it definitely looks to me like a bit strange 
choice of joseki in this position. The point of e5 is usually played to
 build a large position towards the left side, whereas black builds 
towards the lower side. But because of the position of the marked 3-4 
stones, the lower side appears to be bigger than the left side. All of 
the moves A-D are preferable to the game, and I would also consider 
tenuki to take a shimari at o3 or p3 an interesting option.]
;B[dp]C[Can't find the best answer to this. Maybe take the corner with 
C3 ?

om3: No, definitely not. In this shape, D5 is the only move.]
;W[do];B[cq]
(;W[fp]C[I wanted to take the influence on both sides, maybe a mistake 
with cutting points.

om3: This may be an okay move. After B cutting at C5, it becomes very 
tricky though. So as to avoid complications, you can also just connect 
at C5 here.]

connect.]

(;W[gq]C[Bad for white I think

om3: This looks a little bit slow. Instead, I'd just take at c4 instead
 to protect the cutting points.];B[lo];W[pe]C[I think both groups are still safe so I take a big point.
 My idea from here is then to extend around R10, with a pincer or an 
extension];B[qg]
(;W[qj]C[om3: It is usually not a good idea to ignore this type of 
pincer, as R15 (which happened in the game) is too good a continuation 
for black. Instead, you can just play one of the standard joseki 
variations.];B[qe];W[pd];B[qd];W[oc];B[qc];W[ne];B[ic];W[ed]
