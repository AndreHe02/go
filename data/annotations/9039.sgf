C[Hello, my name is Gianluca. I hope you enjoy this review.
First of all i have to say that influence is a hard concept to apply properly in a game i will try my best.
Second i would reccomend to play with human oppent: you will learn moro and after few games you will know your rank!
I think that your estimation is quite good, i thik your level is between 17 and 15 kyu.]

The stones are a bit heavy, but worst of all you are on the third line: you make few point and your opponent gain outer influence]

 I think the white moyo has many weak points especially the forth line (H4, J4 e K4), so you are not a disadvantage, anyway E8 was a big point!]

Again second line, better to go towards the center with L15 or M15]

P18 is not tenuki, it respond to R18. If you don't respond Q10 will die.
