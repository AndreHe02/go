C[Thanks for reviewing the game for me. I played white.  Would you mind to give suggestions on moves where you think a bigger extension would be better or a better move gobally would be better? Also, could you point out which move is a crude style? I want to improve my weakness. I would appreciate any advice about my game.


* Hello !! I play as Litost 3k on KGS and I'll do my best to review your game. Feel free to contact me via email or KGS if you have any question.

* Overall, I think that you are not aggressive enough. Black had many weak groups on the board that could have been attacked efficiently, giving you an easy game, but you did not attack them. I'll show you some interesting options during the review.

=== More About Attacking ===

* Why do we attack? We do not - never - attack to kill, but rather to get some sort of *advantage*, either free territory or additional influence, which can turn itself into territory or help support more attacking.

* How do we attack? We start by creating weaknesses in the opponent's groups, go on by exploiting these weaknesses (chasing the groups using moves such as keima and boshi), and finish by making free points during the chase.]

(;W[gq];B[cj];W[ch];B[pj]LB[cl:A]C[* This move by Black is surely a big point, but this leaves a weakness at A, which may be exploited later.]
;W[nc];B[pg];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[ic];W[qn]C[* I do not like R6 very much. Locally, Black has excellent options. If you want to approach, I'd therefore recommend going for R3, so that your G3 stone works a bit more efficiently.

* More importantly, I think that attacking the corner should not be your first option. Black has indeed two weak groups on the board, while all your stones are safe. What about attacking them and try making free points in the process? See variations.]

* So let's start.];W[ec]C[* Contact plays are normally used for defense. Indeed, touching a stone generally reinforces shapes of both players.

* White has successfully attacked and made profit, while Black group still isn't safe. That is good. What now?

* With J15, Black has undoubtly gained some influence. If he manages to enclose the White group at the top, then the center will be under his domination - we have to pay attention to that.

* Also, Black still has another weak group at C10.  If we could prepare some move that threatens both groups at the same time, i.e. a splitting attack, we would get some additional advantage. Such moves could be, for instance, "leaning" moves or "ladder-breaker" moves.

* There are, locally, many ways to continue the attack: A and B first come to mind, C and D are also possible. However, the benefit of the attack would not be obvious; you may therefore leave the situation "unsettled", and go play elsewhere (for instance E for corner approach, F to start another attack). You will decide how to settle the top at a later stage, depending on how the global situation has evolved.]
