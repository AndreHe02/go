C[Hi, I played Black here. In this game, I was totally beaten. I felt that the game was very one-sided. I was completely being overwhelmed by the opponent, causing me to make mistakes.

So can you point out where to make counter attacks in this game? Because I kept defending and defending, and I didn't it properly too.

I resigned during the mid-game because I felt nothing more can be done, am I mistaken?

Thank you beforehand for the review.


** Hello, I'm your reviewer. I'll mark my comments with **.
Please keep in mind that I'm not a pro. Sooner or later you will find out that my comments aren't perfect.

It's difficult to see opportunities for an attack because you have to analyze which connections can be cut and which groups are weak.

In this game some attacks were made without sufficient support. I hope the analysis of these situations shows you how simmilar positions can be judged. I think this will make it easier to see the potential for an attack in your future games.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[qn]LB[qk:a][pj:b][eq:c][ep:d]C[** If there is a single stone at the 4-4 point (hoshi) a fight for the corner is not very profitable until you can support other stones with your attack. It would be better if you already had a stone at A or B for example.

But right now the left white corner needs a second white stone at C (d3) even if black doesn't play there, and a black attack at C or D is very reasonable. 


In other words: C4 is considered weaker than Q4 and that's why C4 should be your target.]
;W[mq];B[on];W[qf]TR[on][qn][eq]LB[nc:a][nd:b][rd:c][qh:d][ph:e]
[qi:f][qj:g]C[I always panic when someone makes an attack like this, can you give the correct way to defend this kind of attack?

**Very often I play A or B without thinking :-/ and white continues at C or F. But to find a good answer black should also consider to start with C-F depending on the surrounding stones.

Note that your two marked stones give you a lot of influence along the right side and a black stone at G would be a profitable extension.

In this position I'd prefer to play at F because it helps you with two things at once: it builds territory and threatens the white stone.


As white I'd certainly play E3 first, but his attack is reasonable: he attacks two things at once (right side, corner) and his move requires an answer.


If you want to look up Joseki on the net try ... :

<http://waterfire.us/joseki.htm>

Just don't try to memorize to much .. I think it doesn't improve your game as much as (for example) studying openings in chess. But if you "panic" you should look up all "well known" answers and pick the one that looks most reasonable to you.]
;B[nd];W[qi];B[qk]TR[eq][ep][rd][ic][cj][ci]C[** Perhaps not now. It's the right spot if white doesn't play there first, but your group is not yet in danger and the profit is small because of whites R11. I'd rather pick one of the other marked points.]
;W[jp];B[dn]LB[rd:a][eq:b][cq:c][hq:d][cj:e][dj:f][rp:g]C[** I think this corner is indeed your best attack target. But you should start at B and either you can continue with C or D. If you want the left border start at E or F.

I wouldn't approach C4 on the fourth row. White is already closer to the left side and he can easily defend the bottom.

Since you played R9 you could also continue with A and white would have to defend his group.
G might be also an option if you think that white will answer directly.]

(;W[fp];B[cn]C[This was a stupid move, I guess.

** That depends on your goals. I think the previous move (D6) was worse but since white made a 2-space jump an attack on the corner still looks reasonable.

If you don't want to fight for the corner play C5. (After C5 it's more likely that white will respond in the corner and prevent the fight.)  If you want to fight try D4 prepared by C6.]
;W[cl]C[** I think this pincer is too close to the black wall. As white I would start with C11 and I could extend in either direction.]
;B[dp];W[dq]
(;B[cj]C[** Since white answered D4 with the obvious move I'm surprised that you stopped pushing with C3 for example.

You should try to connect to your weak group on the outside ... see variation.]
;W[el];B[dl]C[** It's good that you don't consider a 1-space jumps as uncuttable ...]
;W[dk];B[dm];W[ck];B[dj]TR[ek]C[** ... but I'm surprised that you didn't finish the cut you started. Now white doesn't have to defend much and the lower black group is in big trouble.]
;W[ek];B[fn];W[gk]
(;B[nk]TR[oj][rd][rp][dg][ic]C[** I'm not 100% sure if your group can live but I think you can't afford to abandon it right now.

Note that your opponent probably assumes that your group is already dead or he would have played G7 instead of G9 ... or he would have secured his corner.

Since you don't agree with him (as seen later) you should prove him wrong as soon as possible.

If you think you can't build two eyes with the D6 group then D13 is most important right now. And P10 seems to be a better spot if you want to trap the white stones.

(See variations.)];W[cf]TR[bp][il][ic][rd][oi][rp][dg][eh][ei]
[dl][dm][dn][dp][cn][fn]C[** Unreasonable. White can't extend properly in either direction. The marked black groups is the weakest so white should keep surrounding it if he thinks it can live. Otherwise he should "peacefully" claim territory at the top. If he wants to prevent you from making territory on the left he should be ready to flee to the center.]
;B[ef]C[** Good.];W[ch];B[ei]C[** Nice. White can't connect on the second row.]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[** Once again good answer. It's obvious that white doesn't have much room and will waste moves if he wants to secure his stone.]

;B[hd]C[** Perhaps J16 instead?];W[he];B[ie];W[hf];B[ig]TR[eg]
[fg][if][eh]C[Again, I overextend here, I should have secure my top area with a move around M15, is this true?

** Yes you overextended, but I'd prefer J14. The white group isn't very strong and would need more support before white can start the next invasion. If you could even connect your groups on the left white would be in trouble.]
;W[le]C[** White has two things in mind: extending his right group to the center (P14, sooner or later necessary) and attacking your weak stones (J14, J16). He decides to play a preparation stone that helps with both tasks.]
;B[ld]LB[if:a]C[** Wrong. If you attach to you opponents stones they will get stronger. Since he's almost surrounded by your stones you should consider something else.

Fixing your weak spots with "A" is quite important. White can't connect M15 and R14 with just one stone so you'll have an opportunity to cut "somewhere" later.

Don't forget to consider "shoulder hits" when an attacker is weak. For example L16 would have been better.]

So, as you can see, this is a one-sided game.
Can you give me any inputs on this?

Thank you again.

** Well, your two most expensive mistakes at the left and top side were not easy to see. The moves G11 and M15 served several goals and it's common to miss one of the implied threats.

Instead of analyzing every move from my opponents I tend to keep track of my weak spots - if anything "strange" happens nearby I check if this spot got weaker. Perhaps such an approach might be helpful to you?

Another possibility for improvement is to try to predict (ie: guess)  at least one move before you place a stone. Some of your moves remind me of the time when I thought that predicting wouldn't help because it's too easy. ;-)

Hope that helps, Paul (Illume@KGS)])

White can attack at A but I think if he wins on the left side he will endanger the top left corner.

The "living" black stones work together nicely.

Black could try to prevent a white connection by playing B and white would have trouble defending his three weak groups in the upper half. 

Or he could attack the two white stones on the right side (starting at C) ... even if these stones can't be captured black will build up a strong influence to the center.]
