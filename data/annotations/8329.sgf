AB[pd][dp][pp]C[zaphod [3k\]: l

dv: Hi, I am Dieter Verhofstadt, Belgian and KGS 2d.

The main lesson learnt here is explained at move 39. You lost a big part of the 3H advantage by allowing White to control the top right corner first, then by overplaying there you came out very badly.

After that, there were many minor technical mistakes, which helped White to completely overcome the handicap and have a clear win:
66, 90, 94, 112, 130

You can learn from good stuff too, for example how you confined White to the top.]
;W[dd]C[moyouda [1d\]: 46];B[jc];W[nq];B[kq]C[dv: this pincer is unusual but the idea of pincering is present, so no real harm]
;W[qn]C[z: first instinct was O4 as L3 would limit white's expansion along the lower side - dont remember why i changed my mind]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[qq]
(;B[qo]LB[pq:A]C[dv: indeed, you could have persisted with A]
;W[pq];B[qm];W[op];B[om]C[z: i cant imagine what i was thinking of to play such a slow move!

dv: agree];W[qf];B[qi]LB[qh:A]C[dv: second time you use this ambiguous pincer. This time it is clearly too close to your thick group below. A would have been better.]
;W[qc];B[fc]LB[qd:A]C[dv: you should simply cut at A];W[pc]
;B[od];W[oc];B[qd];W[nd];B[ne];W[md]LB[oe:A]C[dv: White could have cut here at A.]
;B[rc]LB[of:A]C[dv: You are in a weak position. You cannot afford this territorial move. Black should connect at A]
;W[oe]
(;B[of]C[dv: This looks like a sacrifice maneuver. But the sacrifice would be too big.]
;W[pe]
(;B[qe];W[pf];B[rf];W[rg];B[re];W[nf];B[qg];W[og];B[pg];W[me]
LB[fc:A][rc:B]C[dv: White is now extremely strong in the top half of the board. This exchange for having played A is not to Black's advantage.

In summary:

- leaving the front with A led to a disadvantage in the top right
- playing the territorial B in a disadvantageous situation led to more problems

This is definitely the main lesson from this game.];B[lb]LB[cf:A]
C[dv: Here, you approach a strong group. Instead you should play far away from it, for example the double approach of A.]
;W[mb]C[dv: White should not care here and leave the front likewise.]
;B[lc];W[mc]C[z: not dissatisfied with this result

dv: Actually, Black recovered a bit because White anwered so submissively.]
;B[db]LB[cf:A]SQ[lb][lc]C[dv: This move lacks ambition. You have added some strength with the marked stones and should now play double approach.]
;W[cc];B[cf]C[dv: ok! You could also play high here, since White has already taken the corner.]
;W[df]
(;B[ce]C[dv: I prefer to hane here];W[de];B[cg];W[hc]C[dv: counter by White. This can become heavy fighting.]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[ic];W[gb];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd]C[dv: Good technique]
;W[fb];B[ec];W[ha];B[fe]C[dv: Good technique];W[dg];B[ci];W[dh]
(;B[cj]C[dv: This move is lukewarm to me.];W[gh];B[fg]C[dv: This move strengthens White]
;W[fh];B[hg];W[gg];B[gf];W[hh];B[ig];W[fq];B[hq]C[dv: Good.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn]C[dv: Now, Black can look for an attack on the big group in the top left.]
;B[cl];W[cm];B[bl]C[dv: However, this is rather territorial and small.]
;W[em]C[dv: This move provides strength for all groups and also destroys some of Black's potential at the bottom.]
;B[gp]LB[fp:A]C[dv: Better respond at A];W[fn];B[fp]C[dv: Now Black has played very submissively.]
;W[pi];B[pj]C[z: a stupid move; Q11 clearly threatens R12; just a bit of blindness

dv: Yes, and fatal at that.];W[qh];B[rh];W[ph];B[sg];W[ri];B[qg]
;W[qj];B[pl]LB[rb:A]C[z: the debacle over, but b still ahead on the board, right?

dv: Not sure. A is sente for White. It seems about equal.]
(;W[rp]C[dv: I believe the top left white group still deserves most attention. White should keep stressing thickness.]
(;B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[gm];B[ho];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[fk]C[dv: I think the peep does little here.]

(;B[mq]C[dv: A wrong technique, filling one's own liberties.]
;W[mr];B[jr]C[dv: With this big endgame gain, the game is over.]
