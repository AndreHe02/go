TR[ec][kc]C[This seems smaller than a move around E11 or L11.]

;B[hf];W[hj];B[ij];W[gk]C[paperToast [12k?\]: lol, this looks like a rofl game
paperToast [12k?\]: you are winning though];B[hl];W[gl];B[gm]
C[paperToast [12k?\]: your early game was a bit more spread than mine]
;W[fm];B[il];W[hm];B[im];W[gm]C[This is a very small endgame move.  Play elsewhere first.]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[fg];W[fh]C[Likewise, this move can wait, I think.]
;B[ca]C[Black still needs to defend around L11.  The invasion there is the biggest move on the board at this point.]
;W[ba]TR[bb]C[B12 is a stronger connection here.  I haven't read out all the variations, but I think white needs to play it to prevent an invasion by black.]
;B[bc]C[Good move by black.  This forces some tough decisions for white.]
;W[da]TR[cc]C[This is complicated, but the connection at C11 looks like a better move.]
;B[cc];W[dd];B[bb]C[paperToast [12k?\]: niice

(;W[bd];B[ac];W[ad];B[ca];W[kc];B[ld]C[This is not joseki.  I'm not sure what the correct reply for white is, but I suspect it's the cut at L10.]
;W[lc]TR[lb][kd]C[Too slow.  White needs to rapidly build a base.]
;B[jb]C[This move wins the corner for black, I think.  White no longer has the space to build a base in the corner; the only way to live now is a capture.]

[mb]C[Black doesn't need this move.  White's eyespace in the corner is a square, so it can only make one eye.  Better to play outside and make certain white doesn't get another.  Without reading out very far, H11 and L9 look pretty good.]
;W[ke]C[Good move.  Keep black separated.];B[lf];W[ie];B[id]
TR[ka]C[Bad move -- black doesn't need to save this stone.  L13 would be better.]
;W[je];B[if]TR[ic]C[Unnecessary.  White needs two more moves to attack the G8 group.  Since black has commited to saving the K10 stone, he should consolidate that group.]
;W[kf];B[lg];W[kh];B[kg];W[jg]SQ[jf][jh]C[This attack by white can never succeed, because black will always have two threats for cutting: K8 and K6.]
;B[lh];W[ic];B[hd]TR[hb]C[Ouch.  This loses the game for black.  H12 is a better move because it makes H10 and L13 miai.]
;W[hb]C[danny3889 [16k\]: saw THAT coming...
paperToast [12k?\]: XD

Good move for white this isolates black's weak group.];B[hc]
TR[mc]C[paperToast [12k?\]: GOOD!

Not much black can do at this point.  N11 might help contain the damage, but I think white lives unconditionally.]
;W[ia]C[paperToast [12k?\]: that was a really smart move imo]

C[paperToast [12k?\]: I got it


I have a few more comments later in the game, but white has already won at this point.  The invasion in the corner was a little messy -- black had several moevs where he could have stopped it -- but it worked.  Good game - A]
;B[jh];W[jf];B[ki];W[he];B[lj];W[cb];B[ea]SQ[gj][bk]C[Hm.  Black didn't need to give up so quickly.  It looks like he has some ko threats in the corner and around G4.  If black plays at G3, for instance, white needs to respond or black will build a base in white's corner.  When white responds, black can capture back at C13.]
