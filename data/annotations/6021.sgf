C[hello Prateek i'm jero your reviewer.];B[gc]C[this is a standard way of playing it ensures you to have the corner on such a small board.

(but it is slightly different on a 19*19 boardand i encourage you to practice on 19*19 board)]
;W[cf];B[gg];W[fe]
(;B[dd]C[This is too far from the G7 stone. E6 would be better.



exactly E6 defends against the cut because the cut would not be efficient.
moreover it brings more territory.];W[ef];B[ge];W[fc]C[you see now why D6 is too far from G7 : i mean if you look at the board D6 is completely seperated from the rest of your stones. And as a consequence it will be very hard to make it survive.]
;B[fd]C[This is ok. It hurts the D6 stone somewhat, but letting White  push through G6 would be bad.]
;W[ed];B[gd];W[ec]C[The problem now is that  White threatens to take the entire upper left corner and leave Black pushed  down to the third line on the right side. Preferably, Black should bring D6  to life, but that seems to be very hard even before this exchange.




i would like to add that the sequence from 9 to 12 seems quite natural but the result is white is very strong and high on the board : invading would be almost suicide. 
On the contrary even if black is ok with his border his stones are low so it makes not enough territory.]
;B[ff];W[dc]C[why didn't white move to e5.  It would have saved the piece and given it more liberties?
- Prateek



White just want to avoid problems with D6 and so it makes defenitely the upper left corner his territory. 
Besides this is not really necessary to play at E5 because even if black plays there D5 would protect the white border.]
;B[ee]
(;W[df];B[eh]C[A very big move.

why is this a very big move?
-prateek




yes this is even an enormous move on a 9*9 board because you makes a few points but the real reason is you prevent from white playing here. 
Just imagine a white stone at E2 and you will understand that the south west corner would be white. 


The concept of "big move" has to be understood as making territory and preventing from the opponent expansion.]
;W[cd]
(;B[de]C[Answering White's  atari at C6 is gote. There's a much bigger move on the lower side. (See  variation.)


yes exactly : here you have the choice between saving one stone which is "ridiculous " in terms of profit and expanding on the south west. Of course expanding is a better solution because it makes more points for you and  as a consequence less territory to your opponent.]
;W[ce];B[fe];W[dh];B[eg];W[ch];B[fb]C[An important move. If  White gets to play G8 first it's game over.

why is G8 such a critical point? and suppose black did aproach g8 first...how could this have helped him?
-Prateek


yes simply because it would reduce your territory and make a few more points to white when the situation is already a little better for white.]
;W[eb]
(;B[ea]C[This is, of  course, an overplay. Black must connect. But even if he does, it seems he is  going to lose by 1.5 points. (See variation.)


This is my last comment on this game : i hope you already play on 19*19 board it is much better to learn the concept of territory. As you can see, on a 9*9 board, when you make one mistake it can be very hard to make the situation good for you. But when you are a novice and face someone at the same level you still have chances to win at the end on a 19*19 board of course. 



i wish you good games for the future and hope you will increase your level. Good Luck.]
