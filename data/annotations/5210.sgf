C[If you could comment on both of are play it would be appricated. I played as white in the game.

M. Hi! My comments will be preceded by an M:
I hope they are useful to you];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[cj]
;W[nq]C[M: This isn't a common approach to the 3-4 stone in Q3, because when black plays Q5, the O3 stone is too close to strenght (which is not right). I think it would be better to play Q5]
;B[po];W[kq]C[M: You may now see that it was not the correct approach to the Q3 stone, because now your stones look flat and your development slow]
;B[cn];W[fp]
(;B[bp];W[cq];B[dl]C[M: As black i would have preferred a faster pace fuseki. Those black stones seem a bit overconcentrated, while there is a lot of space left on the board.]

;B[kl];W[kh]C[M: This secuence only helped black. Because his center group is now safe, he may reduce the white moyo in the lower side]

;B[hr];W[er];B[bq];W[hl]C[I thought i could attack two groups at the same time here but did not end up that way. Any ideas here for white.

M: I think it is a good idea: the J8 stone is very important, because it's the keystone for putting pressure on black's weak groups.]
;B[gn]
(;W[fl];B[fm]
(;W[ji]C[M: The problem here, is that you are attaching to your opponent's stones. When you are chasing a group, you often do it close, but not touching it. Also, these stones weaken your H8 stones.]
;B[hj];W[em];B[el];W[gm];B[fn];W[ij];B[ik];W[ii];B[hk]C[M: This secuence only made black solid and safer. With no weak groups, he is free to invade or attack]

C[M: The yose part is ok. The main problems for white was the approach to the lower right corner, and middle game issues: attacking& defending mainly. I suggest you put more emphasis on studying life and death problems, and concepts about shape (the book Shape Up! is free and you may find it in the net :-))
It was a pleasure to review your game. I hope the comments were useful.
