(;W[qm]LB[no:A]C[This is the first big bad white move.

This is not the joseki. You should settle your stones in the corner (see the joseki in variation).

If you don't want to follow the joseki, you can still jump out at A]
;B[op]C[Black doesn't miss the opportunity to make his group stronger]
;W[qk]C[Bad move. You leave your white stones in the corner unsettled.

Black will take the corner AND have the outside influence.]
;B[po];W[qp];B[qn];W[rn];B[pn];W[ql];B[rr]C[Black has taken the corner (however small) and a very strong outside influence.

White has taken only few territory.

The result is clearly very bad for white.];W[cj]LB[cp:A][dj:B]
[eq:C][fq:D][iq:E]C[2nd big bad white move.

This is the wrong direction. Moreover, the stone A is already on the 3rd line so if you want to play in this direction, it should be one space to the left at B.

I would prefer making a shimari at C or D, or an extension at E in the direction of the black wall.]

Black has now a strong lead and cannot loose this game.];W[mi]
C[Strange. What's the purpose of this move?];B[nd];W[ne]LB[od:A]
C[I think this is again the wrong direction. Black should appreciate to have a door open into the corner, even if white take some influence on the right side.

Better at A.];B[od];W[oe]LB[pc:A]C[Coherent with the previour error but still wrong. It is still time to play at A to protect the corner.

If white play A, he should take about 10 points of territory in the corner and Black 0. With your move, and the following sequence, Black will take about 10 points of territory and White 0. This is about 20 points of difference. Bigger than the right side.]
;B[pd];W[pe];B[pc];W[qc];B[qb];W[ho];B[hq]LB[fn:A]C[Too slow and over concentrated. Jump at A. This cuts the white stone from a connection to the left and push it in the direction of your strong wall on the right. White will have to run into the center.]
;W[fn];B[jn]LB[ch:A]C[Correct. But the extension at A is bigger.]
;W[il]LB[cg:A][nk:B][mm:C][mn:D]C[I don't understand this move. There is no extension of white moyo, no attack on black, no erosion of black moyo.

If white want to play peacefully, extend at A or B. I would prefer C or even D to erode black.]
;B[lm];W[nk]LB[cg:A]C[Good. But at this time, the extension at A is bigger.]
;B[ch];W[ei];B[eg];W[gh];B[rb];W[re];B[hn]C[Good.

Black has a very strong lead and start now to erode white.]
;W[hm];B[in];W[kk]LB[nm:A]C[Try to protect the center? But there is not much point there, and it is still open on the upper side.
