C[Hello, I need some help reviewing the running battle that occurred from about move 20 to 35. I don't think I got a good result from it.

Mark- Hi, I'm Mark Wong. Horseplay (1k on kgs). I believe that your running fight was fine. There are better places to play, it's just more difficult to explain how the influence will help later on in the game.

However, your later fight is very worrisome, moves like 63 and 65 will lose you many games.

Next time, please show Go Teaching Ladder a game where you lost. It's much more beneficial for you.

Your strengths: 
- Killing.
- Chasing weak groups.

Places where you can get better:
-You want to kill too much. You leave your groups too weak.
-You sometimes play very slow moves like moves 59, and 123.

Keep up the good work.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[po];W[qf]

(;B[fo]C[Mark- you are trying to cut off a large dragon. If you want to get better, you need to find the balance. Sooner or later you will find that such aggressiveness stops working. Not even Gu Li would cut this dragon.

see vars.];W[eo];B[en]C[Mark- Try to see whose groups are stronger. White's groups are much stronger here. Therefore, cutting is very bad here.

In the game, white made many mistakes that won you the game.]
