C[Imagist: I played white in the game.

Hi David,

My name is Frank and I will be reviewing this game.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].  Hope it helps!

C[Imagist: Would this be better at A?

[Frank\] Ive seen this played both ways.  Your move is the joseki move.  The idea is to pressure the F15 stones as that is where the action is at the moment.  Though playing at C14 might feel like it's protecting your corner, the reason it's not the book's joseki is probably because its too passive here..]

(;B[kc]C[[Frank\] Black's aim here is clear - he wants to expand the top right.  I think this is a bit of an overplay...  See the variation.]

(;W[he];B[fg]LB[mc:D][hg:C][ch:A][dh:B]C[Imagist: Here I considered A, B, and C (C aims at D).  What is your suggestion?

[Frank\] How about E17?]
(;W[dh];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb]LB[cd:A]TR[hc][he]C[Imagist: Better at A?  I chose this direction to keep the triangled stones from coming under attack, but it ends in gote.]

C[Imagist: Too slow?

[Frank\] Probably..  C14 was slow too...There is no danger for either group there.  There are a number of bigger points here.  You can kakari here or play the star point at K4 or Q10.]
;B[gc];W[hb];B[fi]C[[Frank\] Perhaps it is too early to attack.  If you attack him now, you can't really gain anything i think..it will be hard to use a wall around the H line especially if he ends up getting R14 or so.]
;W[gf];B[ff];W[nc]LB[mc:A]C[Imagist: I am pretty sure that this is better at A.

[Frank\] I think I still prefer a kakari from the other side.  The reason is that, what if B decides to play Q14 or so?]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[mc]
(;W[nb]C[Imagist: I played this move with sacrifice to take the corner in mind, but I didn't get as large a corner as I had expected.  What would have been better here?]

;B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[pi];B[qj];W[fk]TR[kc][le][me]C[Imagist: Is white thick enough to attack like this?  Black's thick marked stones worried me a bit here.

[Frank\] What are you trying to gain by attacking here?  It is important to have a plan when you are attacking a group.  I don't think there is so much to gain here by attacking.  Perhaps you should just kakari D4.]
;B[hh];W[lf]C[[Frank\] It is quite difficult to attack B here because W is quite thin all around.]

;B[gd];W[cd];B[bd];W[bg];B[ab];W[jk]C[Imagist: I wasn't sure of what to do here, so I played this to attempt an attack on black's cutting stones, but this doesn't seem particularly good.  What could I do here?]

Imagist: Here I estimated that I held a comfortable lead and I didn't need to kill black M6, so I prioritized keeping my groups on the bottom right and center right alive.  The count to the left shows that my estimation was okay (it's hard to estimate the score in 30 seconds byo-yomi!)]

(;W[bj]LB[jo:A]C[Imagist: This is the game-losing mistake.  I missed the squeeze combination starting at A that allows black to capture the cutting stones.  If white plays A, white has the game in hand.

Here was where I felt under time pressure the most; who knows if I would have seen that A was necessary if I had more time?]

[Frank\] Overall, the lead changed a couple times this game because of big mistakes on either side.  It seems to me the part of the game you need to work on would be the early middle game.  It's always good to have a plan when playing, whether or not it is a good one.  (I'm referring to moves like the middlegame attack that did not seem to have a clear purpose.)  

Anyway, I hope this review helped.  Feel free to email me with any questions.]
