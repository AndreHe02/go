(;W[mp];B[pq];W[or];B[fq];W[iq]C[After this move, I'was a little confused. I had not played like Move 8(R6) to move 14(J3) before. I wonder if there was any fault . If yes, please show me the fault.

Erik: R6 is not so good because Q5 hurts your stones to much.  If you wish to switch to that side joseki is to set up a sacrifice of P3.

J3 itself seems risky to me as your stones around P3 is weak and R6 still lacks base.
You also lack a profitable attack against F3 as long as the corner is open.]

(;W[qk]C[I thought this move is important. But I also have strong strength so that I could attack C6 by C10 or C11. Which move is more important?

Erik:  As black will need to spend a move in order to make sure getting his eyes in the corner, and because your own group there is fairly weak setteling your own groups is more important.  Should you choose to attack black on the left he would most likely simply abandon one of his stones.]
;B[pr];W[nn];B[pn];W[qm];B[op];W[mr]C[Erik: At this stage it is important to concider how important your stones really are.  P3 and P2 adds little to the eyeshape of your group, and black is alive on both sides, so spending moves saving the stones is wasteful.  This is the point to concider an attack upon black.]

Erik:  Be careful about witch way you push your opponent(c4 should have been at d3), and don't spend moves saving individual stones.(both P4 and O4 should be seen as an excelent oppertunity to either tenuki or jump into the center.)]

Erik:  Atm M10 looks OK, but the continuations should be trying to secure territory in the direction that black does not go.
In general, and also in this case thebest way to handle moves like these is to be the first to play them.  Here L7 is not necesarry, and you could have played L12 or K12 yourself.]
