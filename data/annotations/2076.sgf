C[My first real attempt at a game on KGS.   I've played on Yahoo! for some time.
I think I opened alright, but mucked up the middle of the game.

I've commented on moves where I think I choose poorly. Any insight would be welcome.

  Yes, I think you had a few mistakes which cost you throughout the game.  Your invasion on the lower left was not solid enough. It would have been safer to connect to the edge of the board at some point.     You were too aggressive in your attempt to capture white on the right side.  Try to play at a certain level of aggression and look at captures as a bonus.  Sometimes chasing a living group can be as profitable as a capture.
  Also, you realized too late that you needed to make life in the lower right corner.
  In general, you play a bit too loose.  Try to occasionally make a connecting/sloidifying move.  Also, try not to connect to enemy stones so often.  Backing off one space or the shoulder hit is much stronger.  Remember that the edge is much more profitable than the center.  White seemed to leak underneath of you many times in this game.

if you have any further questions email me at esh4@po.cwru.edu.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[pj];W[cf];B[fd]C[Proper response to the knight approach.

E - yes.];W[di];B[hc]LB[cd:A][bd:B]C[Would A or B been better?

E - I think it wouldn't be better.  They are both strong, but slow.  As you played is loose, but I think Ok.]

C[Squeezing back.];W[jq];B[hp]C[I like what you are doing here by making some shape with your stones, but it may have been better to try to get a lower shape.]
;W[ip]C[This is a good move for white.  In the next few moves he will be able to separate your stones and there is nothing that can prevent it.]
;B[io];W[iq];B[gp];W[jo];B[dn]LB[jn:D][in:C][fm:B][em:A]C[Poor on my part.  A would have been better I think.

E - yes, A would be better.  B, C, and D would also have been good.  B is a bit less combative in an area where you are weak.]

(;W[cn];B[en];W[dr];B[jn];W[ko];B[kp]C[These are dead: struggling only hurts you.  It would be much better to do this above the two white stones.]
;W[lp];B[dg]C[Aggresive, but white defended, so it was ok.]
;W[cg];B[ch]LB[eh:A]C[Bad.  He will certainly cut.  Remember, this is white's area, so you must play lightly.  A is better, or a play to solidify your top side.]
;W[dh]C[I get cut alot.  :/];B[df];W[bh];B[dq]C[This doesn't really help you, but it forces white to solidify his lines.]
;W[cq];B[eq];W[cp];B[ce]C[Good.  Keeps white out of your corner.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[af];B[md]LB[qf:D][lc:C][oc:B][nc:A]C[Wasn't sure what to do at this point.

e - this idea was good, but it is very loose.  White could invade at the 3-3 point in this corner or in a number of other spots in the area.  A more solid enclosure would be better like A, B, C, D]
;W[eg]C[Good move for white.  Turning the corner on an opponent is suprisingly helpful.]
;B[ef]C[You maybe could have tried cutting him with this move.  It would have started a big fight, but you are strong in the area and your cut pieces would be facing your group on the bottom.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[em]LB[fm:A]C[You should respond and play at A.]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[fm]C[You shouldn't just leave your one extended stone.  Playing where white played his next move is important.]
;W[hg];B[gf];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[gk]LB[gn:A][fn:B][gm:B]C[I was attempting to expand upwards.   Would A or B been better?

E - Yes.  Or at least safer.  Your wall here is very weak (as you later find out).]
;W[gj];B[ik];W[gm];B[fn];W[in];B[hn];W[ho];B[go]C[This move would be better where white played his next move.  You would have been able to capture the white stone and connect outside.]
;W[hm]C[Variant is much better than B73.

E - yes.  good variant.]
(;B[io];W[im];B[ho];W[hk];B[gq]LB[er:A]C[This wasn't important. Play at A.]
;W[km]C[White doesn't need to respond to some of your moves, so he just takes your pieces during his turn.  You can't allow this!]
;B[er];W[cs];B[hr];W[ir];B[is]LB[hs:A]C[I think that A would have saved my group.

E - Yes.  You only needed another eye, which is easy to make on the edge.]

;B[ln];W[mn];B[lm];W[kl];B[ol];W[pk];B[pm]C[This is too much.  White shouldcut]
;W[ok];B[nl]C[These black stones need life somewhere.  You should head towards the right side.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[ml];B[jm]C[Useless.

E - yes.];W[jl];B[ni];W[oi];B[nk];W[qj];B[qk];W[qi];B[ph];W[ql]
;B[qm];W[rk];B[rm];W[qh];B[qg];W[rl];B[rh]C[You are going too aggressively after these pieces.  White, after his next move, has 2 eyes anyway.  White was too solid to take. Your efforts would have been better off making life on the side or connecting with your dead stones.]
;W[ri];B[rg]LB[rj:C][qk:B][sh:A]C[I think that A would have helped kill this group.

E - no. white has 2 eyes (B, C).   Your move was good.];W[nj]
;B[mj]LB[ll:D][qq:C][qp:B][mi:A]C[This is only going to hurt you.  A stronger move would have been better (marked)]
;W[mk];B[mi];W[om];B[nm];W[on];B[si]C[White is alive.  These moves should be spent making life with the lower stones.]
;W[sj];B[sl];W[nn];B[lk];W[ll];B[sh]C[Not worth a move at this point in the game.]
;W[lj];B[po]LB[qq:B][qp:A]C[Gave up on trying to kill, now just trying to live in the lower right.

E - Good.  But A, B would be better.];W[pn];B[qn];W[qo];B[qp]
C[This is bad.  You are not strong here.];W[ro];B[op]C[Way too aggressive.  Try to make life somewhere in this corner.]
;W[pq];B[rp];W[sn];B[oo];W[oq];B[nq]C[This won't help much.  Try working in the corner (though it looks pretty hopeless at this point)]
;W[np];B[nr];W[mr];B[or];W[pr];B[qq];W[qr];B[no]C[Try not to get frustrated and make bad moves.  Look at the games as if you just came to the board and must play with what is there. If this corner is dead, there are other active spots on the board.]
