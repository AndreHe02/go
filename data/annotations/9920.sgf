;B[pd];W[cp];B[qq]C[Didn't understand why the invasion was done now.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]C[R5 shows good spirit but I think it is dangerous since black might cut.  Safer is Q5.  You should look up this sequence ! One place to look up stuff (not sure if this one is covered exactly) is eidogo.com]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[pr];W[or];B[ps]C[I think I should have played P1 here first, to remove any aji left]
;W[nq];B[rr];W[df]C[I approched high here to develop as fast as possible (see var.)]

(;B[di];W[fc]C[I had no idea how to answer this pincer, so I approched myself to get outside influence]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[eb]C[I think I like white D15 instead of F18 for these reasons:

1) It forstalls black C14
2) It protects against the black poke at E15.
3) It has a followup at C16.

If white D15 and black F18 or G18, white can think about H17.]
;W[fb];B[cn];W[ep];B[jd]C[I don't like white J17 because black K17 as an answer builds black and cramps white.   White C16 instead looks possible.]

(;W[ic]C[I hesitated here. I wanted to settle this group, but maybe I should have changed direction of played elsewhere. (see variation)]
;B[jc];W[ed];B[cb]C[I would consider black D15 instead of C18.]
;W[de];B[gb]C[Maybe black C16 instead of G18.];W[dc];B[db];W[cd]
;B[cc];W[fa];B[bd];W[be];B[dd];W[ce];B[ac];W[dl]C[I don't know if this was the correct attack point, but I wanted to use the influence from both my groups to get points at the bottom.

White D8 is certainly a severe attack .

I don't think black should answer at J18.  Black could answer at E6 and if white plays F8 next and black plays G6, white is being flattened at the bottom.

So maybe instead of D8, white would like to play J4, looking for an opportunity to play D7 to build the bottom.  The R7 wall suggests white wants to build the bottom.]
;B[ib];W[hc]C[Instead of white H17, how about E6 to both build the bottom and continue to attack black ?]
;B[gc];W[gd];B[hb];W[he];B[ie]C[Since this J15 move is forcing by black, how about white J15 instead of H15 ?  The thing about defending is to do it in a way that gives the opponent the least number of followup forcing moves.  Always try to get sente !]
;W[hd];B[if];W[qf];B[pf];W[qc]C[Black's J14 and Q14 stones are threatening to build a nice big territory, so black should have answered white's r17 invasion at q17 to continue to build that nice territory !]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[kb];B[kc];W[lb]
;B[jb];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[rf];W[qg]C[That thing I was saying about reducing the number of forcing moves the opponent has, here's another xample.  If black plays R15 instead of S14, then the R13 move by white isn't forcing anymore.]
;B[rg];W[qh];B[rh];W[qi];B[qe];W[fi]C[The cap here was to continue to put pressure on black, and hopefully develop the center


How about developing the center by playing E6 instead of F11 ?  E6 works well with the R7 stones.  The only trouble with it is that black can still incade around J3.  So maybe white should be patient and play around J4 instead of F11.

If white plays J4 and black jumps out to F11, then E6 looks nice for white.]
;B[ej];W[fl];B[fj];W[ck];B[en]C[
White F6 look more natural than G5, since it has a good relationship with both the F8 and E4 stones.]
;W[go];B[gn];W[ho];B[fo];W[fp];B[gi];W[hn];B[gm];W[ch]C[I hesitated on what to do with my weak group. I though I could use it to harass black but maybe I should have saved it instead.]
;B[ci];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[bk];W[bl];B[cj];W[dn];B[dm];W[do]
;B[cm];W[hm];B[gl];W[bo];B[cl]C[
So white b7 doesn't work out so well.

Once black has played c8, white has sacrificed the D8 stones so it's important to get big stuff in return.  How about instead of B7, white plays j9 ?  

Also, are you confident as white that black can't invade at something like h3 and live ?  If one more move down there by white such as h3 is the difference between black making a living group or not making one, it's worth the one move.

Often, the best time to invade is just before one more move by the opponent would make uninvadable territory, and the best time to defend is when just adding one move makes uninvadable territory.]
;W[bm];B[bn];W[an]C[
Instead of capturing at f9, black could make a bigger capture with a8.]
;B[dk];W[ao]C[
Black is alive so the 2 b7 stones aren't important so white should not play a5.  Find something bigger !  Maybe h3 or j9 ?]
;B[am];W[al]C[same thing.  find something bigger than a8.

Actually, the white upper stones at D14 aren't alive so white needs to do something there.  For instance, black might start at F14 . . .]
;B[co];W[bp];B[el]C[not needed . . .];W[hl]C[I like j9 better.]
;B[hk];W[ik]C[black h9 doesn't look good since white is building much more with j9 than black is building with h9.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[gk];W[jk];B[ii];W[ki]C[This is when Black did his deep invasion. I don't think I handled it well]
;B[jm];W[il]C[
j8 is the sort of move you use when black k7 is as strong as your k9 stones.  But since white has more stones in this area than black, instead of j8 how about m8 and just start swallowing black up ?]
;B[oo];W[po];B[mo];W[lp]C[My thoughts here were : at least, I will try to secure the bottom]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[op];W[oq];B[lo];W[kp]C[Black might have started this entire invasion at something like j3, and tried to make life down there.  easier to make life near edge than in middle.

But since black didn't, the white n3 and L4 stones are good for white because now black can't invade at bottom anymore, plus black isn't alive in middle yet.]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[om];W[mm]C[I think this was a bad move];B[kl]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[jj];B[kj];W[ji]C[
K11 lets black out at M10, which causes black to also be threatening N9 atari.  So, instead of K11, how about white M10 to keep black contained ?]
;B[li];W[lj];B[hi]C[black needs life for the L8 stones so H11 is not important, EXCEPT for one thing, which might be what black was thinking, namely that white's upper stones aren't alive yet.

In other words, if all the upper white stones die, it's ample compensation for black losing his center stones.

Black might start with F14 as mentioned before.  If white takes at D17 to start a ko, it doesn't make eyes . . .

. . . Although I have to admit that the black upper left corner isn't clearly alive either !  One has to rea out white starting with B19, black trying to make an eye with B18, white playing A15 (which helps white's eye space on the outside!), black trying to complete his eye with A16, and white fighting a ko with A18.]
;W[mi];B[lh]C[This black M12 seems to allow white to kill the black center so black really needs some compensation.]
;W[nk]C[Since my stones were disconnected from the left, I tried making eye shape

Your stones are not disconnected from the left.  There's dead black stones there at L9]
;B[pl];W[ql]C[
whtie really wants to keep black q8 from connecting to either s12 or s6.  White R7 is very strong so R8 is not efficient.  Maybe s9 instead ?]
;B[pk];W[oi]C[This was for safety, but I think it let black connect]
