C[Me (sw): White
Opponent (Sansri): Black

sw (me): From the beginning, Black has been playing the moves that I usually play. Black has been playing at the sides and corners. Seeing as how the sides and corners are usually worth more points than the center, how should I go about taking the sides and corners from Black? Or are there other good moves that I can make to help me score more points against Black, who has taken over most of the sides and corners?

Hi sw.  Thank you for the opportunity to review your game.
I'll prefix all my comments with 'Sirkut:'.  I go by that name on KGS.
I hope you find the review helpful.];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd]

(;W[df]C[Sirkut: When you attach (play a move touching your opponents stones) you actually make your opponent stronger because you force them to make thickness to defend.  Remember that to win you must surround more territory than your opponent.  You can do that without capturing any of your opponent's stones.]
;B[ch];W[qn];B[ql]
(;W[pl];B[qj];W[pj]C[sw: When Black played his/her stones at R8, R10, and C14, I attacked them with my stones closer to the center. Should I have attacked the stones with my stones closer to the sides instead? I fear that if I play it closer to the sides when Black played his stones on the third row, he/she will easily capture the stone.

Sirkut: You should worry about the safety of your groups and getting territory before thinking about capturing black.  You could also think of it as building reinforcements before you attack since you cannot capture with a single stone.  See the variation on move 10.]
;B[qm];W[pm];B[pn];W[po];B[on];W[qo];B[oo]
(;W[qi]C[Sirkut:  This move doesn't help at all.  It's too close to black and not attached to your other stones to help the T19 corner. It also gives black the T1 corner without making him fight for it.  See the variation.]
;B[qp];W[qk];B[ro];W[rk];B[rl];W[sl];B[rn]
(;W[fq]LB[ce:B][jq:A]C[Sirkut:  While it is a good to think about invading and keeping black from turning the space around K4 into territory, but this isn't a great way to do it.  The move marked "A" would have been better because it'd give you the option of extending to either side  -- depending on which side black pushes from.  Move "B" would also be very good.  See the two variations.]
;B[hq];W[cn];B[ck]LB[cq:A]TR[cn][fq]C[Sirkut:  Now your two marked stones are in really rough shape.  You'll get something out of it, but not the whole corner that you're hoping for.  Move "A" would be good follow up here because it lets you connect and create a decent-sized live group with one of your stones, but you'll probably have to sacrifice the other white stone.  You're too weak in this area of the board to try a pincer like this yet.  You're asking for a difficult and risky fight.]
;W[fn]C[sw: Is there a better spot to play than F6?

Sirkut: Yes, C3.  See the comments on the previous move.];B[jq]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[dr];B[cq];W[cr];B[br];W[dq];B[cp];W[bs];B[bq]

(;W[jd]TR[cp][dp][bq][cq][br]C[Sirkut: This is a good move, but your work in the A1 corner made black's marked stones very weak.  It is probably more urgent to take advantage of tthe weakness now before black has a chance to strengthen them.  See the variation on this move.]
;B[fc]LB[ce:A]C[sw: Black played at F17. How should I approach the stone?

Sirkut: You don't wan't to attack yet.  "A" would still be a great move for securing your corner and it would give you a strong shape to attack with.]
;W[fd]TR[dd][df]C[Sirkut: This a very weak shape.  It's your directness here that costs you the corner.]
;B[cc]C[Sirkut: Here black uses the move I explained at move 31.]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[dc]LB[gb:B][md:C][qf:A]C[Sirkut: It's already too late to do much here.  Save these moves for the end game and get big points somewhere else like A, B, or C.]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[de];B[cg];W[md];B[qc]C[Sirkut:
When you open on the 4-4 point and don't follow it up with a 3-4 or 3-5 later, always expect your opponent to play the 3-3 invasion like this.  
You handled this situation fairly well, but since this is so common I've illustrated in the two variations on the next move the typical way of dealing with it.  It's worth learning.]

;W[gb];B[db];W[fa];B[eb];W[jj]TR[eh][bl][ml][ho]C[sw: I played Tengen (the middle) because I thought taking control of the center might help me beat Black. Is this the best move right now? Is there another another good place to play?

Sirkut: Any of the marked moves would give you a more definite profit.  A good proverb to use when you aren't sure to play is "Your opponents good move is also your own good move."  Look at where black has the most potential to profit and get there before he does.]
;B[ln];W[jn];B[fk];W[hk];B[fi]TR[fg][eh][hh][ml]C[sw: The black stones at C9, F9, and F11 take away a lot of points I would get from taking control of the center. Is there a good way to block them? Is there another good place to play?

Sirkut: Actually black's moves here aren't doing as much as you think.  The best strategy is to create territory by extending from your thickness (walls) while at the same time threatening black so that he gets heavy (dense and inflexible)  without creating much territory.  I've marked a couple moves that demostrate this.]
;W[ff];B[hi];W[jh];B[hg]TR[gh][gj]C[Sirkut: Black is still doing less damage than it might at first feel like.  He is not making much territory for himself; he has yet to make any of your stones weaker and his shape isn't very strong.  I've marked the two weakest points for you, both of wich you could use now.]

Sirkut: You're welcome.  Thank you for submitting it.  It was an interesting game and you played well.  

Some key things to think about:
- Don't think about capturing your opponents stones, think about making territory and strong groups/shapes.  A fun proverb is "Play away from the sound of your opponents stones (your opponents strength)"
- Extend away from your strength while threatening your opponent's groups to build territory in the center
