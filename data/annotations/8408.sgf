C[Hi Marcello,

my name is Felix and I reviewed your game. My general advice for you is, that you always have to look for the big picture. For example sacrificing unimportant stones can be very powerful. And by that I do not only mean one or two stones. Sometimes also 5 or even more stones can be sacrificed. There are several examples in this game.
If you have questions regarding my comments and variations, feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Felix];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]LB[pe:A][qn:B]TR[pc][pp]C[With the white stone on 4-4 in the bottom right, facing the 3-4 black in the upper right it is urgent for Black to either play a shimari around A or approach the bottom right at B.
Otherwise White will approach at A which will work very well together with his bottom right corner.]

Black should not try to pull them out right now. Moves like A or B are bigger, even if the marked black stones get lost!
The black stones are not important, because they are no cutting stones. That is also a reason, why they should be sacrificed for now.]

was E 6 a bad move here?
i feel like the follow-up was really good for me.

Answer:
I would say, that this move is very slow. The area there is not important anymore.
Why is that?
The white group on the left is alive. The white group on the bottom is alive.
Black's center group is connected and alive.
Black also has a good chance to live in the corner, even if White gets another move there.
Moves around A/B are looking much bigger to me.
