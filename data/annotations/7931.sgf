C[Hi, thank you for reviewing this game.

I'm playing White.];B[dp];W[pq];B[dd];W[pd];B[po];W[qm];B[qq]
;W[pp]C[Recently, I have been experimenting with this bumping move.

I know that the resulting joseki is bad for me if we take a look at the ladder, but I was pompous enough to play it as a trick move.

CG: This move by itself is not a trick play ...];B[qp];W[qo]
;B[pr]
(;W[or]C[At this point, I thought he knew the punishment, and it would've looked rather nice for Black.

CG: ... but this is a serious mistake. Joseki is to play atari at 14 immediately. Obviously you are gambling on your opponent not knowing the counter, which a bad style.]
(;B[qr]C[CG: This is of course a bad move.]
(;W[oo]LB[oq:A]C[CG: This is a mistake. You should just play the kake-tsugi (see Ishida vol. 2). It seems that you don't know your own hamete very well. 
The atari is gote, so you are left with the bad aji at A.];B[pn]
;W[qn]
(;B[on]C[CG: Black misses another chance to get an acceptable result ...]
;W[oq]
(;B[no];W[rp];B[rq];W[ro];B[rs];W[sr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[nr]
TR[dd][dp]C[At this point, I thought that T3 and M3 are a miai, so it seemed like I there was no way for me to lose the capturing race in the corner.

CG: The best black can do is to try to get some forcing moves. Considering blacks position on the left, trying to get outside influence (instead of making live in gote) might be a valid strategy.]
(;B[ps];W[sq]
(;B[op]C[CG: Another mistake by black.];W[lq];B[kr]C[Black felt really aggressive, trying to kill me while I'm out and all.]
;W[mp];B[np];W[mo]C[I tried to threaten O6, but didn't end up in good shape.

CG: This is a bad move because it allows black to hane at the head of two stones. Capturing directly would have been better.]
;B[mn];W[nq];B[jp];W[ko];B[kp]C[CG: Bad style - white has a good answer at M6 ...]
;W[lo]C[CG: This is a slack answer compared to M6.];B[jo];W[nm]
;B[nn]
(;W[lm]C[Here it seems that I'm jumping closer to the weak side, forcing black to defend directly.]
;B[mm]
(;W[fc]C[CG: It's unwise to play tenuki in the unsettled fight.]
;B[km];W[ln];B[ll]
(;W[jn]LB[kl:A]C[CG: This move is a big mistake, allowing black to get a squeeze. It would have been better to cut at A as black can't resist (see variation).]
;B[jm]C[CG: This is a good counter! White is shut in.];W[im]
;B[kl];W[kn];B[in];W[io];B[hn];W[rr]TR[lm][jn][kn][ln][ko][lo]
[mo][mp]C[CG: This move is premature. Now white is shut in, the marked stones are not serving any purpose, so saving them is only worth 16 points in gote.

So _now_ you should have played tenuki.];B[os]LB[df:B][ms:A]
C[CG: I can only suspect that blck is aiming at A, but of course this move is a mistake. Black should take advantage of white's mistake and switch to B.]
;W[ns];B[lp];W[mq];B[kq]C[CG: This is a wasted ko threat.];W[qs]
C[Black lost atleast 2 ko-threats here.

CG: That's not quite correct - M4 was only worth 16 points, so it was not really a ko threat. So he really lost only one ko threat.]
;B[fe]C[CG: This is an interesting move which tries to make use of black's thickness.]
;W[ho]LB[ml:A]TR[im]C[Instead of answering F15, I felt there was still something going on here.

CG: There is still some aji related to the cut at A and pulling out the marked stone, but I think H5 is premature.
Usually it's better to leave such cutting stones until you can decide which sente moves you can utilize in a later fight.]
;B[hq];W[go];B[dn]C[CG: This is of course a bad move as it allows white to capture the important cutting stones.]
;W[hm];B[dj];W[gn];B[ec];W[eb];B[db];W[ed];B[dc];W[fd];B[df]
;W[jd];B[qf];W[qh];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[pe];B[qb]C[This is a rather new move for me.

It seemed that if I answer at Q18 now, black will push at Q14 and my push&cut at R15 will have no effect.

CG: Yes, this is the idea of this joseki.];W[pf]C[so I thought blocking the push would be OK.]
(;B[rg]C[CG: Joseki is at S14.];W[pb]C[I was happy to get both Q14 and Q18.]
(;B[rh]C[I didn't find S12 too threatening, since I was never trying to build territory on the right.

CG: S12 is also a very big move for white, so I understand black wants to play it.]
;W[dl]C[Is this invasion point OK?

I had some backup after capturing the two stones in a ladder, so I felt this shouldn't be unreasonable.

CG: Yes, this invasion is of course ok.];B[em];W[el];B[fl]
(;W[fk]C[CG: This leads to unnecessary complications. Just attaching at E10 looks easier. Did you read out what happens if black cuts now?]
;B[ek];W[fm];B[gl]
(;W[gk]C[Were these bad forcing moves?

CG: For me it looks like you should try to get F10 in sente - so yes, this seems to be a bad aji keshi.
The exchange G9 for H8 is a minus for white and I don't see how it will help you in the fight.]
;B[hl]C[I mean, if black next plays at J8, he gets a surprisingly strong position compared to before.]
;W[cj]
(;B[dk]C[CG: This looks vulgar.];W[cl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[bm]
(;B[ci]C[CG: since black obviously wants to kill, he should atari first.]
;W[co];B[do]C[CG: As black can't kill, he should play C4.];W[cp]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[br]C[I was happy to live in the corner.]
;B[eq];W[gq];B[gr];W[hr];B[ir];W[fr];B[fq];W[gs];B[gp];W[iq]

[gl][hl][kl][ll][jm][km]C[Here I made a mistake.

I thought that P7 captures black unconditionally.

CG: I don't think this is a mistake. This move also aims at the stones on the left.]
;B[hs];W[om];B[pm];W[ol];B[pl];W[ok];B[pk]
(;W[qj]C[CG: I'm not sure wether R11 would have been better. R11 also leads to a difficult fight.]

(;W[pi]C[CG: This and the following moves are unreasonable. Why didn't you just play J10?]
;B[ri]

[km]C[How to continue building territory at the top?

CG: I think this is the wrong question - the marked whites stones are too important to be thrown away. The loss is too big to be compensated for with one more move for your moyo.]
