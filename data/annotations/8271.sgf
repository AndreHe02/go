Hi, I'm k43r, and i'll review your game. Through the game I'll point some basic mistakes, and i'll write quick summary at the last move.

Hope you'll learn much from this!];B[pp];W[ee]C[I advice you to make some standard moves, but if you like fancy ones, then play them.]

You will attack black stones, build points on upper side and prevent himself from closing your corner.]

Thanks to the stones p15 and r14 you can build much more efficient shapes!]

;W[fp]C[No, no, no.

This move is called "pushing from behind" and is generally considered bad.

A is giant move.

inefets [12k\]: thx bye

You played resonable game. Main mistakes:
1. Playing funky variation in LL corner instead of normal one.
2. Playing passivly on upper side. (move 26)
3. Not killing black group at move ~154.
4. Loosing UR corner.
5. General playing of small moves.

Advice for future:
1. To learn normal shapes you need to watch games of stronger players. I advice you to watch some gtl reviews of people 5-6 stones stronger then you to get used to normal shapes.
2. Here you'll need to watch games of stronger players and think a little more about each move when playing.
3. This is 23 kyu mistake. Shame on you for letting it live.
4. Reading problem - do some tsumego, concentrate more when playing. It's easiest mistake to correct.
5. Will come naturally with developing of your go skills. You can also review each of your games with someone stronger. 

You have good basics, you are reading well (except UR corner) and your moves always make sense. I think you'll progress a couple stones in near future.

thanks for interesting game. If yu have questions you can contact me by mail ( I am not often on kg)]
