AB[pp][dp][pd]C[Hey reveiwer! Thx for reveiwing.. I'll try to point everything out, but I'll probably miss something, so please tell me about everything wrong you see.

Carnubak: There are a few general guidelines which I think can help you improve your game.  I have made them just from what I saw in this only game, so you might find them obvious or not depending on your previous playing experience. I try to point out everything I feel could help you.
Be warned that this is my first review, though, so it may not be of the greatest quality, but I'm spending extra time on it because of that. I hope it helps you improve your playing.

Here are the guidelines:

First, try to avoid making empty triangles (three stones at a right angle) because this is an inefficient shape and can lead to clumps of stones with few liberties and which secure almost no territory.

Second, link your groups, while cutting off your opponent's. This will lead to a stronger position from which to attack.

Third, avoid attacking from both sides of an enemy group, because that will create two weak groups against a strong one most of the time.

Fourth, if you intend to attack a stone, do not play in contact or near contact with that stone, but attack from a distance. Contact plays reinforce both groups, so they should be used for defense only.

Fifth, use influence to attack, and play away from strong groups whenever possible. This is probably the most difficult skill to learn while playing Go.

And now, let's begin the review...];W[dd];B[jp];W[pn];B[mq]
;W[fp]C[Carnubak: Pretty classic up to this point. Your play from the left was right, since you played near your weak stone an away from your strong ones.]
;B[cn];W[dl]C[what is good here? I didn't know how to respond.

Carnubak: Since white is attacking from both sides, you should try to cut his groups off each other, so that he ends with two weak groups to defend. A play at E7 would be desirable, creating pressure on the stone at D8 and starting to surround the stone at F4 between two stronger groups of black stones.]

(;B[cf]C[Carnubak: Playing here creates the oppontunity for white of playing a pincer, strengthening his D8 stone while attacking your stone, and sure enough, that's what he did.
If you want to attack that corner, I suggest you do it from the other side, where you can expect a fairer fight. You can see two possible sequences in the previous branches.]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[fe]C[same here..

Carnubak: Your group is being attacked from both sides and is heavily outnumbered. Your attachment of C16 had success in creating life for the group, but at the expense of the upper side. A play at B16 would create room for maneuver.]

(;B[cd];W[dc];B[de];W[jd]
(;B[md]C[was this good?

Carnubak: This move is very restricted in scope by the influence of the white group on the upper left. You should probably have played on the broader side, while aplying pressure to the white stone at Q6.]
;W[qf]C[Carnubak: Because playing on the other side allows this, and white gets great prospects on the right side.]
;B[rd]C[Carnubak: This move is too submissive. It would have been better to effect pressure on the R14 stone with a pincer of some sort.]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[Carnubak: Here you're reinforcing your opponent's stone against your weak stone at O17.]
;W[nd];B[od]C[Carnubak: As a result, you get cut in two, and your stone at N16 is heavily attacked.]
;W[ne];B[of];W[ph]C[Carnubak: White defends, because P14 separates the two groups.]
;B[pk]C[Carnubak: Nice move, splitting while attacking. White has to choose one group to defend. You should see the comment on move 30, though.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[pf]
(;B[qm]C[Carnubak: The ladder on the stone at P14 is good for white, so the attempt of cutting the two white groups apart does not work. It is more urgent to defend that stone, than to immediately continue the pressure on Q6.
Notice that the stone at Q9 is not in immediate danger. Check the alternative.]
;W[qn]
(;B[qi]C[I really didn't knwo what to do..

Carnubak: You should protect the cutting stone, since white has not yet played the ladder at P13. Notice also that, since you created a base for the stone at Q9 and it can easily run into the center, it is not that urgent to protect it.]
;W[rm];B[ql];W[rj]C[Carnubak: Here, S10 can connect to either the upper or the loer white groups, so it is your choice from which one to isolate it, but since the lower group is weaker, severing that connection seems more pressing for white and can even give you the opportunity to capture the S10 stone.]

(;B[qj]
(;W[rk]C[Carnubak: Here you have the opportunity to isolate S10, with the following sequence.]

(;B[rg]C[Carnubak: S12 is better to cut the two groups apart here.]
;W[qh];B[oj];W[og]
(;B[ng]C[Carnubak: This move is too close to the white strength. Maybe playing a ladder breaker around  F6 would be a good idea now, since white would almost be forced to ensure the capture of P14 and you can then apply more pressure on the stone at F4.]
;W[nf];B[nh];W[oi];B[ni];W[nj]C[Carnubak: Letting yourself be cut like that is not good, you get two weak groups.]
;B[nk];W[mj];B[rh];W[ri];B[rf];W[rl]
(;B[no]C[Carnubak: Now that your group in the center becomes isolated, you should work in letting it out. Maybe a cap at O6 would have been better.]
;W[nn];B[gq];W[fq];B[gp];W[gr];B[hr];W[mk];B[nl];W[ml]
(;B[qk];W[pi]C[about now, i know the R8 is dead

Carnubak: Not yet, the connecting sequence still works.];B[dr]
;W[er];B[eq];W[fo]C[Kamtre [20k\]: ok, thx];B[go];W[fm];B[mn]
;W[on];B[mm];W[nm];B[jn];W[gn];B[hn];W[kr]C[Carnubak: This stone should not be allowed to make life, it is a reckless move from white.]
;B[lq]C[Carnubak: In my opinion, O2 better restricts the movements of the stone at L2.]
;W[oq];B[pq];W[mo]
(;B[lo]C[Carnubak: P5 is better here.];W[oo]C[Carnubak: Here you fell in white's trap, you should sacrifice the stone at O5 by playing P4 and O3.]

(;B[np];W[op];B[nq];W[or]LB[rp:A][mr:B][ms:C]C[Is A better than B? (or C)? A is better, according to score est.]

(;B[mr];W[rp];B[gm];W[fl];B[hl];W[bm];B[bn];W[cc];B[bd];W[bg]
;B[bf];W[lg];B[he]C[Carnubak: The three stones at O12 are important and can help you capture the four white stones at N10, if you manage to save them, you should probably try an attachment at M12.]
;W[hd];B[ge]C[how should I be invading/defending in these places?]
;W[gd];B[ff];W[jj];B[lm];W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[hk]C[Carnubak: Cutting with H9 looks good for me]

K, so what did i do wrong? What should I have done better? I'd love to know. Thanks for the help!

Carnubak: Try to keep connecting your groups and cutting your opponent's. Search the board for the move you think is best, and try not to get so carried away in a local fight that you ignore the rest of the game. Try to think globally, and weight every move for its overall potential rather than its local one. And feel free to send me any comments on the review, especially if it was helpful to you.

Good luck and take care.])
