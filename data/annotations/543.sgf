;B[cd];W[qp];B[dq];W[pc];B[ec];W[do]C[Black's
next is not joseki.  Why?  It takes the corner, but surrenders too much influence on the outside. F4
and C5 are more common.]
(;B[bp];W[cl];B[cj]C[Black's 9 was a rather long
extension, leaving a chance for white to invade above (C12) later. I
would have played at C11 however, the actual move might be justified by
black's strength on both sides. In any case, white is not in any danger.]
;W[jc];B[oq];W[fo]C[Black's next is too submissive. The corner is secure.
Playing out like that give white more influence than black's territory
justifies.];B[fq];W[md]C[White's 14 is something of an overconcentration.]
;B[qn];W[po]C[Black should respond to white's move.  White's two stones
are weak, and there is something to be gained by threatening them this is
too close to white's strong position (the stone will eventually be
captured).]
(;B[qe];W[np];B[nq];W[pq]C[N3 might be better than N4. The cutting point
at N3 is a weakness (see comments around move 30).]
(;B[mp]C[White next
correctly forces black back against white's strong
position.];W[qh];B[qj];W[oh]C[Now the black stone at R15 is as good as
captured.];B[pl];W[ro];B[rn];W[nn]C[Something closer to the weak group at
O3 would be better than black's next (e.g. K4 rather than
H4).]
(;B[hp]C[White's invasion is probably not his best move; black will
be able to harrass the stone and gain strength (in the game, this stone
is eventually captured), but it puts black's weak group on the
run.];W[kq]
(;B[ko];W[lp];B[lo];W[mo];B[mq];W[iq];B[hq];W[kr]C[So, this
situation depends on tactics -- can white capture the stones at N3-P3
before black captures the invading stones?];B[ir];W[ip];B[io]

has won the fight. However, he needs to actually get out.  Also, the
threat against his other group on the right needs to be carefully watched.
Although it should be able to live as is, it is very
weak.]
(;B[dg];W[nj]C[The group at right is even weaker. Black's replies
are OK, but fail to address these
threats.]
(;B[hk];W[el];B[ej];W[bo]C[White is settling his weak group.
Black wants to handle it so that the sequence ends with his sente
(opportunity to move without having to respond to threats). B8 does not
do this, because he will have to play B9 to save the stone. Compare
playing B9 right away - a few less points locally, but sente is probably
worth 20 points.];B[bl];W[bm];B[bk];W[qi]C[Now, white goes for black's
weak group.];B[ri];W[ok]C[Although I don't think that white's moves were
best, they do constitute a threat. Black's next ignores that
threat.];B[hd];W[jr];B[hr];W[js]C[This move (K4) makes no sense
whatsoever. The white stones cannot possibly make two eyes, so capturing
at K5 necessarily kills them. This only allows the possibility of
connection at K5 followed by threats to black's group.]
(;B[jp]C[Back to
the group at right. The last move in this area was P9 (move 62), which
black should have answered.];W[qk]C[I think that black is dead, but Q9
leaves no doubt. The sequence here after S9 is one
possibility.]

C[Black
just had a group of five stones cut off. Although I'm not going to discuss
all the moves, this illustrates two things: 1) it is hard to defend large
territories like that which black claims. 2) when doing so, it is
necessary to draw the line less ambitiously.];B[kh]C[This should not work,
but it is a valient (and successful!) try.]
(;W[oi]C[Why did white play
here? The connection being blocked is between two groups of dead stones!
However, white is willing to give up the four stones in the very center
rather than risk resurrection of all of black's stones.];B[jh]

stones.];B[ck];W[cm];B[aq];W[le];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf];W[mk];B[lj]
;W[dk]C[Three
mistakes by black in the next few moves. E9 is one.  Notice how black's next creates cutting points and how white exploits
them. Compare D10.]

points. It is critical to keep your opponent out of your moyo! The white
stones at the very center are clearly dead, but they are allowed to come
back to life.]

Black would have won if he had not allowed the two late intrusions - from

have saved the game, so I urge more attention to weak groups.]
