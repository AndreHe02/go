Shall I attack the black group on the bottom, or shall I do something about upper center.

black bottom is fairly secure, black center is not territory yet so you must reduce.  

These are possible.]

Practice some basic shapes.  

Study a little bit of joseki and do life and death.  

I think you'll improve quickly.])
