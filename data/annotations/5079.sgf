Well done, you won the game. You played pretty well and managed to get good results in local fights and capturing races although you submitted a little too much to white's moves and lost a few occasions to take sente.

Here are the main points I noticed :

* The opening moves for both white and black were too slow and heavy.

* You waited too long before invading the white moyo. You should have settled on the left side as soon as your groups were alive

* Around move 65, you spent many moves defending your group when you should have been attacking and chasing the white group.

* In the endgame, although the score was very tight, both players played small gote moves when large moves were still available.
