C[
Welcome. My name is Paul and I played white with my girlfriend, who played  black. Please indicate our biggest mistakes, what is our greatest weakness and please  answer the questions that appear in the game.


thank you very much

Nilsen:
Hello,

I will review this game.
Shall try to review the best I can.

After the review please read comments on last move for some general comments on the game.

Will start my comments with "Nilsen:"];B[bb]C[desaq : my new movie, I know, it is unusual

Nilsen:
Simply ineffective.];W[pd];B[dp];W[pp];B[ec];W[fq]TR[dc][dd]
[be][de][fe][cf][df][ef][dg]C[pablos: good direction?


Nilsen:
The top left part of the board is quite strange.
However black's two stones are pointing influence in the direction of the left side.
(See arrow on the board)

I think playing on the left side is biggest.

Also there is 12 spaces open on the left side,
while only 10 and 11 on the other sites.
Therefore the left side should be biggest.

Please see variation.]
(;B[cn];W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[pf]C[Nilsen:

This approch is special case only.
This gives a worse position for black locally.

What this move wish to do, is remove white's posiblity to devolop moyo on the top side.

In this stage of the game, I would call this a mistake.

Please see variation.]
(;W[qf];B[qg];W[qe];B[pg];W[nd]LB[jc:C][lc:B][nc:A]C[Nilsen:

"A" is more common when white don't have a move on the top side.
This move also increase the aji at "B" later.

Now white feels he owe a move around "C".];B[qk]C[Nilsen:

Good for white.];W[qn]LB[qi:B][qm:A]C[Nilsen:

White can play @ "A" to threaten the severe invasion @ "B".

Please see variation.]
(;B[cd]LB[bb:A][di:B]TR[ec]C[Nilsen:

Seems slow.
This shows the ineffeciency with move "A".

I would play around "B".

Another way to look at it is:
If the marked moves was already on the board.
Black would NEVER play @ "A".];W[ci]LB[cf:A][cl:B]C[Nilsen:

Good move, split up the side.
Have miai at "A" & "B".

Please see variatoon on "B" aji.]
(;B[mp]LB[pq:A][or:C][pr:B]C[Nilsen:

The top side looks bigger.

Also a typical way to play locally to split white's side is "A" "B" & "C".
This is often play when the opponent have made a encloser from a Hoshi stone.

Please see variation for some examples.]
(;W[nq]LB[np:B][mq:A][oq:C]C[Nilsen:

Proverb:

Do not touch/attach to weak stones.
Shoulder hit counts as touching weak stones.
Because we know black now have to play "A" or "B", and it will be a touching fight.

I think playing C good.

Just to secure the courner.];B[mq];W[kp]LB[nq:A]C[Nilsen:

White's "A" stone is out of place.];B[lc]C[Nilsen:

Seems to close, but I'm not sure.];W[jc]LB[nc:B][nd:A]C[isn't to early for invasion?

Nilsen:

Hard to say really.
I think invasion is the only option.
However we can now see why "A" would have been better at "B".]
;B[le];W[gc];B[nb]LB[oc:A]C[Nilsen:

I think playing @ "A" is possible, to peep at the shape of white.]
;W[pb];B[mn]C[Nilsen:

Black have to be careful, he is starting to create to many groups without base on the right part of the board.
White should focus on keeping the groups split.]
(;W[kn]LB[le:C][pg:B][qi:D][mp:A]C[Nilsen:

Wrong side.

Black have three groups which can be attacked.
White only have strong groups.

A&C are weak groups.
B can easily come under attack.

@ "D" black have huge aji.

Please see variation on taughts.];B[np];W[oq];B[cr]C[Nilsen:

While this is a big move, it is not the biggest.
Seems slow.
If this is a prep. for attacking the top side it might work.

Please see variation on what I mean.]
(;W[eq]LB[er:A]C[Nilsen:

Small.

With some reading we can even see that "A" is gote for black later.
Please see var. and decide which senario you would like better.]

(;B[ck];W[cf];B[ee];W[ge];B[nl]C[Nilsen:

Black have slowly made most of his group connect.];W[kq]LB[le:A]
[nf:B]C[Nilsen:

Slow

"A" is still blacks weakest group, and have to be attacked somehow.
Splitting at "B" seems logical, to split black and reduce his potential on the right side.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[mr]C[Nilsen:

Slow.

Black can continue to attack white.

Please see variation]
(;W[nr]LB[eh:A]C[Nilsen:

Slow.

"A" seems urgent.]
(;B[eh];W[dj];B[rm]C[Nilsen:

Maybe a little slow, and seems gote.];W[rn];B[js]LB[jr:A]C[pabloss : what is the best movie for white here?

Nilsen:

This is also slow.
There are many end-game (yose) moves played at the time.

White should tenuki.
If white have to play locally "A" seems best.

Please see variation]
(;W[ir];B[fo]LB[ge:A][dj:B]C[Nilsen:

Seems slow, there are still bigger fish to attack in this ocean.
Like "A" or "B" group.];W[bj];B[nf]C[Nilsen:

Black have now connected all his groups, and white failed to attack any of his groups.

I think white should have a hard time for the rest of the game.]
;W[mi];B[oi];W[mg];B[mf];W[mk];B[rg]LB[oj:A]C[Nilsen:

Also seems a little slow.
Black have to be careful of "A".

See var.]
(;W[rf]C[Nilsen: 

Slow];B[ql];W[fb]LB[je:A]C[Nilsen:

I would play A instead, going into the center is often more important then living on the side with few points.

Please see variations on some stuff both might try.]
(;B[eb]C[Nilsen:

Slow];W[be]C[Nilsen:

Getting  base, might be ok.];B[lg]LB[ll:A]C[Nilsen:

You are forcing white to become stronger this way, and making him make an tigers-mouth.

Cutting around "A" seems more important.];W[lh];B[bd]C[Nilsen:

Slow];W[ml]LB[kg:A]C[Nilsen:

"A" seems urgent and sente.]
(;B[nm];W[lm];B[kg]C[Nilsen:

Black got the white-sente move.

Getting an atari like this in the center of the board are often very big.]
;W[kb];B[fm];W[am];B[bm]
(;W[al]LB[ak:A]C[Nilsen:

Playing "A" to get sente is most of the time better.

Please see var.];B[an];W[bk];B[bl];W[ak];B[cj];W[bh];B[dh]C[pabloss: my mistake, I should play d11

Nilsen: yes.];W[ch];B[di];W[gk];B[hh];W[je];B[hl];W[gl]LB[ij:A]
C[Nilsen:

Typical escaping move is @ "A".

See variation.]
(;B[gm];W[hm];B[il];W[im];B[ij]C[Nilsen:

Black gain to much out of these moves.];W[ld];B[kd]C[Nilsen:

See var for simpler variation.]
(;W[md];B[kc];W[ke];B[jh]C[Nilsen:

Wrong.

Letting white kill your stones loses you the game.

See var.]
(;W[jd];B[nh]C[Nilsen:

Slow.
Gaining very little here.
Not sente.

We are getting into late game, I will call out some bigger end-game moves which should be main focus for both players.
Searching for sente.

There are currently no weak groups left, and most of the board is settled.

Please see var.]
(;W[sg];B[sh];W[sf];B[rh];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[mh]C[Nilsen:

Small.
White should not answer here.];W[br]C[Nilsen:

Good call.];B[li]LB[bq:A]C[Nilsen:

Small.

"A" is big sente for both players.];W[mj]C[Nilsen:

Still small.];B[om]C[Nilsen:

Bad shape and small.];W[oj];B[pj];W[ok];B[qm];W[bq]C[Nilsen:

Can't let white go into your territory.

"A" seems big.];W[jn];B[aq];W[eo]C[Nilsen:

This will be the last comment.

There is only endgame left.
Black is far behind and white continue to reduce.
White won this game when the black stones on the top was killed.

[sl][cm][bn][gn][nn][on][ao][mo][no][ap][bq][br][as]C[Thank you from the game.
It seemed like a fun game.

I feel the story of the game is as following:

White had the better opening.
Blacks inefficent first move was a part of it.
Black made to many baseless groups.
Into the middlegame I would bet on white wining.

I felt the game tourned around after black managed to connect all of his groups.
White failed to attack blacks weak groups, and black made good potential on the right side.

When black failed to attack white's reduction stones in the middle, while white killed
the tree stones on the top, the game tourned around a second time.


Weakness in this game:

White's biggest weakness was not attacking black's weak groups in the opening.
I advice going into this link:
http://eyd.yunguseng.com/lectures.html
And watch Opening & Attack theory a few times.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYNNjuhrTk
This video on attacking is also quite decent.

Black's biggest weakness was the way he made weak groups early on.
Any stronger player would abuse that, and I would dare to say the game could/should
have been decided within 70 moves.

I feel both of you in general need to study how to attack, and the danger of having weak groups.
And the effectiveness of attacking for profit.

Also quite early in the game some very typical yose moves appeared, this is moves which gives very little points.
And should not have been played so early in the game.

If you have any question, please contact me with E-mail or message me on KGS.
