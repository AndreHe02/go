C[Review is asked by juhop, playing black.

It was a close game, but white would have won with komi.

I would like to see mistakes pointed out in fuseki and early midgame, but of course any comments are welcome.

Because I notice many white mistakes, there must be even more of them by black ...

C[> Everything looks fine for
both black and white.];W[pn]C[> white is trying to build moyo in the bottom side,
but black can stretch on the right side and get sente,
not bad.];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[qp];B[qk]C[> usually it is played at R8 or R10.]
;W[nq];B[en]C[> E6 is not bad, also can
play on the upper side];W[fc];B[dc];W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[> O17 looks too passive.
surely I will play at R12
to pincer white first.
If white enter into the corner, black can build influence, if white jumps out,
black can also jump out.];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[> white looks good now since the right side white group
is settled and the right
side black group looks 
a little bit unsettled.];B[hc]C[juhop: the fight that starts did not turn too easy for black. I wonder if H17 is already wrong or if I just make too many mistakes later.

is settled, then black will
have no chance.];W[fe];B[he];W[fg];B[cf];W[df];B[dg];W[ef];B[dh]
;W[lc];B[ne];W[ke];B[hg];W[fi];B[fk]C[> better to play at H11
to strengthen the 3 
black stone. 
 Black already
has enough territories. The 
safety of the 3 black stones
is becoming more important. Wiith the
jump of H11, both white 
groups will feel pressure, and there
is no connection at H18.];W[hh];B[ig];W[ih];B[kg];W[lg];B[gd]
C[> don't like this move.
doesn't make much
sense. Only when white
plays at H18 to try to 
connect,  you can play
at G16.];W[fd];B[kf];W[lf];B[kh];W[ng];B[rc];W[id];B[hd]C[> now the previous move of G16 is
useless, and the exchange of G16
and F16 only helps white.];W[ij]C[> black has no eyes and has to flee to
the center.
So it seems the previous move of F9 has
problem.];B[kj];W[ol];B[kl];W[pl];B[ql];W[om]C[> a really bad move for white. white already
blocked the black, and the move at S4 should
be very forceful.];B[rp];W[qm];B[rm];W[rq];B[ro];W[rj];B[rk]

at J8.];B[il]C[> now white is really

C[> black should play at
 H7 first to avoid the 
ladder, and white has to
try to live inside.];W[jn];B[km];W[hl];B[hk]C[> a mistake for black?]
;W[gk];B[gj];W[hj]C[> black lost much here and the 
center black group has trouble now.];B[fj];W[gi];B[lo];W[kp]
