C[In this game I'm playing white. I will be very appreciative if someone can give me some tips and show me my mistake in the game. In advance, thanks for all the work you put in this

paichan [12k\]: hi, enjoy the game

Hi --- my name's Mark Schlatter (mschlat on kgs and dgs).  I hope this review is helpful.  Note that I'm only 7 kyu, so I may make mistakes on variations or miss some of your mistakes.  However, I hope that some of my comments can help you see the game more clearly.  If you have questions, I'm happy to answer them at mschlat@gmail.com or online at KGS.  It's good that you're getting your games reviewed --- that's an excellent step to getting better.]

C[This is not a typical joseki (although it is joseki according to Kogo's).  You are emphasizing the corner and giving black a chance to take the right.  I believe there is a risk of being sealed in here.]

(;B[qe];W[nd]LB[od:A]C[Here Kogo's suggests A.  However, I haven't found a way to punish white for the extension.  Again, the white stone in the lower left is very helpful.]
;B[qh]LB[qi:A]C[Black is playing timidly here --- an extension to A is called for.]
;W[jc]C[This is a good move, but I don't believe it's the biggest move.  You do extend the upper right group, but that group is pretty much alive already.  More important are the bottom and left --- you have large areas that both players are interested in.]
;B[gc];W[nq];B[lq]
(;W[pr]LB[no:B][qq:A]C[This is not joseki --- you are diving for the corner giving black a chance to seal you in.  (See my variation to Black's 15.)  

More typical moves would be A or B.  I've placed some joseki below.]

(;B[gq];W[qn];B[oo];W[qp];B[ql];W[pm]
(;B[pl];W[cm]LB[om:B][mo:A]C[I'm uncomfortable with the looseness of the framework in the lower right (see my variation to Black's 21.)

Why not do more to finish off this corner?  (Say A or B perhaps.)  A, in particular, might help set up an invasion of the bottom later.]
;B[cj];W[cg]C[Again, I think the lower right is bigger.];B[ce]
;W[eg];B[ej];W[em];B[fl];W[fm];B[el];W[dl];B[dk]
(;W[go]C[Note this sequence here: you extend to the center....]
;B[er]C[.... black naturally moves to the corner with some sente....]
;W[cr]C[..... and you respond in gote.   Consider the alternate sequence of moves starting with 34 --- you gain more territory and pace.]
;B[np]
(;W[oq]LB[mq:A]C[This is an "inside move" --- I think you want an "outside move".  A maintains the strength while giving you more possibilities on the outside.  The last variation handles what happens if black tries to cut at your move.]
;B[mq]
(;W[nr]TR[cg][eg]C[A small move --- I don't think this is needed for the health of your group (testing variations below).  So I think you need to look to your weak groups (say, the marked stones).]
;B[mr];W[je];B[pq];W[qq];B[mo];W[po];B[op]
(;W[os]LB[ol:C][om:B][on:A]C[Again, this is a small move.  Yes, you take away a forcing move from black, but this group can't be killed (see variation).  A move at A, B, or C is more powerful and gets the lower right out so it can affect the rest of the board.]
;B[om];W[pn];B[on]C[And now you're sealed in....]
(;W[io]LB[hp:A][ip:B]C[Ignoring the weak group in the upper left (which will need attention soon), a locally better move here is A or B.  You are more threatening, black has to respond, and you gain more.]
;B[iq];W[gl]LB[gg:A][fh:C][ck:D]C[I'm uncomfortable withe next sequence of moves.  You take the center left black group (which is somewhat weak) and attach to it with the stones from the bottom left.  These are already alive (so you add little to what you have), but you help black immensely.  By move 63, black is alive and thick, and you have to run.  

I'd rather strengthen the weak group before the attack on black.  I've marked some possible moves.  D might be doable since its aftermath makes D11 a forcing move.]
;B[fj];W[il];B[cl];W[dm];B[gk]
(;W[hl];B[hk];W[jj];B[ii];W[gf]C[Potentially cuttable --- see the variation.]

(;B[bg];W[ch];B[bh];W[bl];B[ck];W[df];B[cf];W[dh]C[I don't see a good rationale for this move --- you gain an eye, but it looks like you mean to run to the upper right for your eyespace.]
;B[ci];W[hb];B[gb];W[hc];B[gd];W[hd];B[fh];W[fg];B[eh];W[gh]
LB[ed:A][re:D][of:C][ng:B]C[Again, a relatively small move.  Your stones are already fairly well connected to the upper right, and the group you are haneing is already alive.  Locally, I think A has some interesting options.  Globally, the B area is the biggest.  You can try to flatten at C or reduce at D.]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[hi];W[ig];B[jh];W[kg]
(;B[kh];W[of];B[pg];W[og];B[oh]
(;W[lj]LB[nh:A]C[I think haneing at A has potential.];B[km]

;W[ho];B[kl]
(;W[lk];B[kk];W[kj];B[jk];W[ik]SQ[ga][sd][rm][ms]C[I don't see a purpose for this move --- you are (almost) connecting two living groups.  I think moves along the sides (marked with squares) are bigger.]
;B[ij];W[lh];B[im];W[jm];B[jn];W[hm];B[in];W[hn];B[jo]
(;W[ki]C[Again, I don't see the purpose of this move --- you are already connected (see variation).  Why not save the stone at K7?

This is the last of my comments on specific moves.  Here are my overall comments:

1) If you haven't spent some time on joseki, I'd recommend learning a few now.  You don't have to memorize a lot, but it will help to know some basic patterns.  You might start by exploring the different joseki that apply to the lower right.

2) Think carefully about "small moves" --- I've tried to point them out during the game.  Especially during the opening and midgame, you want each stone to have import.  You want to look at the entire board and examine which areas are still up for grabs.  And try to avoid moves close to your own living groups when there are other issues on the board.

3) I believe a more skilled opponent would have made much profit from your two stones in the upper left (especially after you strengthened the center left).  Look to your weak groups and make sure they are safe before you attack.

I hope this is helpful --- enjoy playing!];B[ih];W[jg];B[jl]
