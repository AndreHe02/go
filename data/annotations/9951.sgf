C[Hello dear reviewer! Today I played this really close game with a 2 dan. I was feeling strong so I played without a handicap, only 0,5 komi. In the end, black wins by time but I think black would have won with points too. Thanks for reviewing the game, I really appreciate it. I'm training for a tournament in which I will play on March. :)

forfun (hereafter ff): Thanks for a nice active game. They can be the most fun to review. :-)

This game had an interesting start as both sides failed to recognize that Black had deviated from joseki in the upper left corner. More important for later events, neither player was really familiar with the joseki in the lower right either! :-) In the upper left, Black chose the joseki but left out a critical play. In the lower right, White chose the joseki but did not know how to follow up. It shows that we should try to develop a deeper understanding, not just remember some familiar patterns.

White chose a center-oriented strategy entering the middle game but Black showed a better understanding of the direction of play and was able to disrupt White's center. Nevertheless, Black ran into trouble in the fighting on the right side and was behind as play shifted to the endgame IMHO. However, Black showed a more energetic approach in the endgame and recovered to be slightly ahead when White ran out of time.

Let's see what happened...];B[pd]C[h3horse [2d\]: hi];W[dp]

(;B[cb]C[I can play this because the ladder works for me right?

ff: Unfortunately Black forgot to push at F14 first! What happens if White cuts now?]

(;W[jc]C[ff - White does not recognize Black's joseki error! Neither player is wide awake in this game. See also White 42 later in the game. :-)]

(;B[fq]C[Would a move around q10 have been bigger?

ff: See the variations. If you check pro games where White refuses to cut immediately (but Black F14 and White G15 have been exchanged), Black goes back and connects as soon as possible. Of course it is especially important here! :-)

We can't say that q10 is bigger than F3. The right side is as wide open as the bottom. They are just two different games.]

(;B[on]C[Would s7 been ok here?

ff - It is always a possibility when Black has some support in the upper right. However, there is a sense that if you have to ask, the answer is, "No"! The reason is that the S7 variation tends to involve immediate, sharp fighting right around the lower right corner. So Black needs to know how to continue. If Black is not prepared, then the usual joseki with the play at P6 instead of S7 is more reasonable.

In this game White has a strong, stable position on the upper side after K17. It is not so clear that Black will gain from the variation with S7. White naturally depresses the bottom somewhat while running out here. Black wants compensation on the right side. However, White should be able to invade later because the top is strong.]
;W[rm];B[pm];W[sn]
(;B[mc]C[Wasn't sure about this move, is it the biggest? How about f6 or something?

ff - N17 is not close to being the biggest move. It leaves R17 wide open and has little effect on White's strong position at the top. How will Black continue at the top?

Meanwhile Black leaves two big cutting points at the bottom, P5 and P7. This is a known joseki, favored by people who like fighting. However, it means that Black is thin along the bottom. It is difficult to use the bottom for large-scale frameworks. If we look across the board in this game, the question arises is N17 worth enough to justify leaving the bottom thin?]
;W[om];B[nn];W[ol]
(;B[qe]C[f6 here?

ff - The situation in the lower right has just started. Black should be punished severly for leaving in the middle of a fight. However, White has chosen a joseki that he does not understand!]

(;W[hq]C[ff - This is not the natural invasion point here. Neither Black nor White understand the joseki played in the lower right.]
;B[hp];W[ip]
(;B[iq]C[ff - The direction of play looks rather risky here. Black's position on the right is not very strong. So fighting with White in the lower right does not seem like a good idea.]
;W[io];B[hr];W[jq];B[ir];W[ho];B[gp];W[lo];B[jo]C[ff - This is not good for Black. It creates a shortage of liberties that should help White in the future.]
;W[jn];B[kq]
(;W[mm]C[ff - This looks natural in that White has a lot of center-oriented stones. However, it lets Black off too easily IMHO.]
;B[mp]
(;W[lp];B[lq];W[mn]C[I wonder why white didn't cut here at d14 now that the ladder works for him

ff - As mentioned before, the ladder has always worked for White. Nevertheless, D14 was the vital idea here. Black can not break out from the bottom right, but can from the upper left.]

(;B[dg]C[ff - Black shows a better grasp of the overall situation. Good choice!]
;W[eh];B[ff]C[ff - The problem is that White may not cooperate...]

(;W[ge]C[ff - This looks like a mistake in direction. White should resist in the center. If White can not survive at the top, K17 must have been misplaced.]
;B[id]C[ff - Black wants to pick a fight here but the top is not that big.]
;W[ic];B[gf]
(;W[hf]C[ff - Lucky Black! The two stones are much smaller than the center, White plays from the wrong direction again.]
