C[I saw some of my mistakes, but I don't know what good alternatives would have been. Also, this is my first GTL request, so let me know how to be more helpful in my SGF comments.

OK - I don't know your strength from the review request - I play around 3k UK, and I guess you're somewhere around 10k?  Main comments would be that you need to gain more whole-board appreciation, and also gain and use influence rather than taking a territory-dominated approach. I've just raced through the game in a couple of minutes before doing the detail, and standing out are the small territorial move at O3, reluctance to take the open corner around D16, and the missed opportunity to win the game at the end with the cut at S14.  I'll try to expand on these as I go through now.]
;B[pq];W[qd];B[dp];W[qo]C[this move is unusual but perfectly playable.  white is trying to frighten you by not doing the expected and taking the top left.  you should ignore him and take it yourself.  see variation.]

(;B[nq]C[better to take advantage of white's generosity and grab the spare corner, which is the biggest move on offer. O3 is both small and defensive - to make it bigger, at least attack white (P5 would work), or extend further and possibly higher at N4]
;W[pn]C[strange move from white - would only have expected a move here if you'd played something more aggressive like P5 which actually threatened the R5 stone - he is handing you back the initiative - you should be after that top left corner again!]
;B[pk]C[there are several problems with this move. firstly, white gets to make a perfect opening move at R11, which is both an extension from R16 and a pincer on your stones. secondly, you have no room to make eyes on the side. thirdly, white's Q6 stones are not weak - they have both the corner and centre to run into, and are well connected. fourthly, you should be playing in the open corner :-)

when you make a move, consider the possible responses from white and what your follow-up move will be - if there isn't one, then what you're considering is probably a bad move.]
;W[qi]C[there you go...  white is now a happy bunny.  you should now swear inwardly because you missed this :-), take a deep breath and consider the whole board.  top left corner....]
;B[qm]C[this is not really hurting white.];W[pm];B[ql];W[mm]
C[the painful lesson to be learnt here is to leave this for later; use it as aji.  continue to play here and you will lose the game. instead of you attacking, white has attacked you, made himself stronger and left you with no eye space between strong white groups.  at dan level or above the game is now over and we're only 12 moves in!]
;B[dd]C[hooray!!!  best move so far, and you can take credit for getting there before white!]
;W[fd]C[high kakari best answered by one point jump at D14, or in this case you could make a sanrensei at D10. E18 is small and places too much emphasis on territory - like your O3 move.  D10 would build a large scale framework on the left side, and D14 would have white worrying about an invasion / pincer around K16.  see variations]

(;B[eb];W[ef]
(;B[cf]C[this is a bit wimpy - you could have played D14 quite safely, especially since E18 is in place.  see variation from previous move]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[fb];B[db]C[small - you're in no danger if white captures this stone.  you need to invade at M17, then which ever way white extends towards you, you can make the ideal two point jump the other way]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cn]C[think whole board again - main danger to your game is white getting huge framework top right.  so, if white tenukis, think - do I need to answer??  here you do not, and M17 is much more important.  it's possible that you're thinking about trying not to damage the position for your R8 stones, but think of them as aji - they're in a horrible position by themselves, but when you're invading close by, white will always have to keep an eye on what you're doing with them.  that way you will get profit from them.]

(;B[cl]C[F4 preferable to give helping hand to lower right. see variation from previous move]
;W[cp]
(;B[dq]C[wimpy - hane at c3 much more threatening - see variation again]
;W[do];B[eo];W[cq];B[dn];W[co];B[em];W[dr];B[er];W[cs];B[ep]
;W[lp]C[white has got away with murder in lower left :-) now we should make him pay for his audacity of invading where you are strong.  use the force, Luke.  sorry, I meant the wall :-)]

(;B[kq]C[again, think about the likely response - this is inviting M3 to split, so is it the correct move?  walls should NOT be used to make territory.  squash him against it instead with N5 or the like.  the wall is strong enough to look after itself.]
;W[lq]C[White splits the lower right group

well, to be fair, you did invite him to do this :-)  S3 is now critical for your corner group to live]
;B[lr];W[kp]C[amazing that white didn't play N2!]
(;B[jq]C[B lets W advance toward his wall--should have blocked?

white has let you off the hook by not splitting - play N2 yourself - see variation off previous move]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[ho];B[oc]C[Tenuki was probably wrong for B

well, N2 advisable, certainly, but think about white response again.  if this was at M17 (still the biggest move on the board...) you'd be able to get a position either way]
;W[pc];B[mc]C[Too small?

Standard move is P16, but this invites extension and pincer from top left stones.  real problem was P17 move before]
;W[kc]C[there it is...];B[lb];W[lc];B[md];W[ke];B[lg];W[od]

(;B[nd]C[nasty shape - try P18 instead]
(;W[dh]C[white should continue attacking black at the top since the group is by no means alive. see variation from previous move.]
;B[df]C[B is letting W build a big territory in the upper half

yes, and so consequently making sure your top stones are irrevocably alive should be a key priority]
;W[ee];B[ch];W[ci];B[bh];W[dk];B[fk];W[dm];B[en];W[dl];B[gi]

;W[km];B[lm];W[ln];B[ll];W[ml];B[mk];W[mq];B[nk]C[B gets a decent territory= around K10

it's tiny - you've invested around 20 stones to get about 20 points.  white has 4 mapping out 25 points top right.  think influence (followed by invasion to reduce territory or attack where territory happens as a side effect) rather than territory]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[oj];B[oh];W[ph]C[mistake by white - should push through and cut at P9]
;B[og];W[pg];B[pf];W[of];B[oe]C[Soshu [?\]: ugh];W[qf];B[nf]
;W[pd];B[pe];W[ob];B[qe];W[re]C[good push through, now screaming out for S14, which is big enough to tip the balance back to you.]

(;B[go]C[B has to fight for small life for his E4 group

S14 will decimate white.  and anyway, E4 does not need defending - see yet another variation off previous move :-)]
;W[hq];B[gq];W[hr];B[mr];W[np];B[op]C[Mistake--leaves bad cut at O2

not at all - O2 is not a problem until you miscount liberties later P4 is good and pushes into white's position]
