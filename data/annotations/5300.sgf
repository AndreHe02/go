C[I was playing white in this game. In this game, I met some situation where I wasn't sure how to play. I managed to win against him luckily because he made a few mistakes that cost him the game.

Hi Daniel,

I'm only a few stones stronger than you so I hope my comments are useful]
;B[dp];W[pe];B[dd];W[op];B[pc];W[nd];B[qp];W[pn]C[--
Thinking about the strategy here, white is developing thickness at the expense of territory and the right side looks easier to create a moyo on than elsewhere.

It is going to be easier for black to reduce white's moyo than it is for white to maintain it.  

I'm not saying there is anything wrong with what you're playing, you've just picked a style of fuseki I find easier to refute than to play.]

I would have played R17 instead.];B[re]C[i think this is too soon?
--
yes];W[qd];B[qh];W[fc]C[--
I think R10 is bigger, you can come back to F17.];B[id]C[--
I don't like j16 here];W[fe];B[df]
(;W[if]C[is this move okay?
--
Yes, but see variation for the ordinary play.];B[ke];W[kg];B[mf]
;W[le]C[is this cut okay? My friend suggest L17 instead. Is it actually okay, or there is better move?
--
No, this is an overplay];B[hf]C[i was not sure to respond this move
--
You've overplayed, but you have not lost anything yet.  Accepting that you've overplayed just concentrate on the board in its current state... There are big moves attacking the right, there is the potential to generate good territory on the top, and there is potential to create a good central moyo if L13 becomes strong and another move at say Q11 is added.

So you still have good choices.  My 'autopilot' move would be H13 which leads to the central moyo.   Thinking about it a bit more, I think I would play L16]
;W[ie];B[jd]C[is it better for me to protect h15?];W[lf];B[gd]
;W[fd];B[he]C[--
So, to reassess, you now have a mildly weak group at F17 that needs settling; some juicy looking attacks on the right thanks to M14 being strong and N14 isolated, some aji with the 'dead' J14.  

I think the most urgent is D17, followed by R10.];W[qj]C[which better f13 or r10?
--
Good question, I would have said D17 :)  Running with F15 feels less interesting than settling them since black already has D14 and H14 in place... I can see something like exchanging F13 for D18 being annoying since you're left still eyeless and H14 is pretty strong so you're going to be hassled for a while.

R10 is very important though, it would take nerves of steel to ignore it.]

good, but can S8 first];B[fg];W[dc];B[cc];W[cb];B[db];W[ec]
;B[jp]C[--
Reassess time.  F17 group good, no real room to expand so that area is uninteresting.  

Good cash on the right ans S8 appears to be sente threatening a huge kill.  

Breaking up the left is ugent, black playing say C6 would be disasterous.  

So, can white get away with S8 before breaking up the left?  My guess is no, so where to break up the left... either C9 or C6 look good.]
;W[pj]C[i think now i should move c9
--
Yes.

I also think you're overemphasising the centre far too much with Q10.  You have emphasised the centre from the start and black has maintained plenty of cental influence (k4, H14)... I just cannot imagine you winning this game through a central moyo.]
;B[rl];W[pk];B[ql];W[ph];B[pl];W[or];B[qs];W[mp];B[no];W[np]
;B[nm]C[i didn't know how to respond black move\--
Well, you have to live with N4 without helping black's grand moyo plans.  How about L6?  Really though, this just confirms my opinion about Q10 :-)]
;W[jr]C[--
Normally this is a good move, I'm just really concerned about the left moyo it will help black develop.]
;B[mr]C[--
Mistake, should be L2];W[kq]C[--
Good];B[hq];W[kp];B[ko]C[--
Overplay? feels greedy];W[jo];B[ip];W[ln];B[lo];W[mo];B[jn]
C[--
Okay, assessment time.  white sadly is not safe yet and that left got stronger.  Say you tenuki to invade the left in gote... see var.

Alternatively, you expand this group, trying very hard to do it in sente.  If I was more confident in my reading I would tenuki, the left is just getting too big.]

(;W[nn];B[on];W[oo];B[dk]C[--
All pretty much as expected.   What to do now?  Options include B5, F9 (aiming at c3) D8... I think black is comfortably winning this game now.]

Odd... that move usually does not work...];W[cn];B[dn]C[This is the second move that I think cost him the game. Maybe he should have played B6 instead

Interesting, I did not consider B6 but you're right, it appears to work here.]

At last, thank you very much for spending ur time for this game. And also if u dun mind, please comment this game for overall. Once again, thank you very much :)
--
Overall, I think you made a strategic error in this game of greatly overvaluing a central moyo but black failed to punish you for it.  The comfortable win you got came from some very expensive reading errors/overplays by black.

I hope this is helpful, if you have any questions, please send me an email.]
