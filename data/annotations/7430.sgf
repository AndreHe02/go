C[I'd like to thank you in advance for reviewing this game for me.  Lately I haven't been able to win any games.  I start out pretty strong, but it seems like every time I get into a fight, I always lose it.  I hope that I might be able to get some advice on the opening and middle game, as well as some joseki and tesuji.

Hello, Johnathan!

I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

First of all let me tell you that I enjoyed watching your fighting game - I felt reminded of my own games when I was 5k. But like every go player I know how bad it feels when you're on a losing streak. You can't really do anything, they occasionally come, and they go. Sometimes they are a sign that you are about to get stronger. Which of course is no reason for us not to look for ways to fight them! ;-)

Let's first talk about this game and see, if there are blind spots in your tactical understanding, then I'll give some general advice about how you can sharpen your sword.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[qf];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[pj]C[Hon: This is a joseki mistake. After S16 one always plays R11. Later your opponent will find out why.]
;W[jc];B[cf];W[ch];B[fc]
(;W[ee];B[db]C[This completely threw me off, since I've never seen someone play like this before.  Is there a proper way to respond to such a move?

Hon: If you had covered black with D14, you would be able to handle this easier, but I don't think you're in danger. 

First of all, you are the boss in this corner, so since he refuses to live quickly by entering 3-3, you should look for a ways to deny him easy life by creating weak black groups.]
;W[cc]C[Hon: I think this is good. It gives you a thick shape and leaves the opponent with two weakish groups.

You have not such an efficient shape, but this would not cost you the game on your level (or on mine).]

(;B[cb];W[bb];B[dg]
(;W[ck]C[Hon: Too passive.]
(;B[bd];W[bc];B[dc];W[cd];B[be]C[Hon: Since black fumbled around in the corner, he now missed the opportunity to get out ...]
;W[gd]C[Hon: ... and you wall him in. Good!];B[fd];W[fe];B[ge]
;W[gc];B[fb]
(;W[gf]C[Hon: Very bad move!

This is the right moment to introduce an important conception to you, which you either do not know yet, or don't understand in all of its implications. It is the conception of the "family feud".

When two parts of a family fight against each other, it is a misery, like we know from Romeo & Juliet. They should work together, help and protect each other, instead they fight a war and destroy each other, missing the real enemy.

On the goban a "family feud" means, that you play a move from one of your groups, that hurts another of your groups. In this game you both started several family feuds, so we will get back to this a few times!

When you think about how to go on with the fight, it is crucial that you avoid any move that helps the opponent with no need, or hurts your own other stones with no need - it's enough that your enemy thinks about that! 

In this situation you would like to kill black's top group, but to do that you need the two stones at G16. But your atari strenghtens black ...]
;B[he]C[Hon: ... and now your stones at G16 have become weaker, which will help black to survive.

Your corner group is having a family feud with the stones at G16!]
;W[fg];B[ed]C[Hon: This move gives you a good excuse to hurt his shape.]

(;W[de];B[hb];W[id];B[dh];W[di];B[ei];W[dj];B[fh]
(;W[cn]C[Hon: Here you save one of your groups, but the top left still has two weakish groups.]
;B[if]C[Hon: Black gets this move, and your groups are separated. This is bad for you and part of the reason why you get hunted so much now and lose so many points at the bottom.

Capture the crucial stones!];W[gh];B[gi];W[hf]C[Hon: Here we have yet another case of a family feud. This move seems to help your upper left group (it is not really necessary), but it hurts your top stones.]
;B[ie];W[hh]
(;B[jd]C[Hon: Black could have done simpler (see variation), but this sequence also means a lot of trouble for you.

This would be a family feud - black damaging his top left group - but there are some pitfalls lurking here.]
;W[ic];B[kd];W[kc]
(;B[ig]
(;W[hi];B[gj]
(;W[ji];B[hg];W[gg];B[lg];W[og];B[gb]C[Hon: A pity that black survives, since if he died, your group would automatically be out of trouble. And then all the points!]

(;W[ib];B[li];W[ik];B[gl]
(;W[qh]C[Hon: It is good if you are able to cash in somewhere. This is the consequence of his joseki mistake.

But maybe it was too early

Also the shape still has aji as we see later.];B[hj];W[ij];B[im]
C[Hon: Now black got the large point, making the bottom look very black.]

(;W[jm]C[Hon: Normally it is good to resist confinement with all your power, but there are situations where it does not help you, or it helps the opponent more. 

It would have been good to get J7 yourself, but now that black has it, every further white move will only help him increasing the bottom - which is a pity.

But you have the option of simply living!];B[il]C[Hon: About the following fighting sequence I like that both of you try to ignore the opponent and frustrate his intentions. I am not sure about every move, but that feeling of fighting spirit is good - keep it! 

But in general, as stated before, I think that fighting here helps black more than white, since it affects the largest open place on the board - the bottom side, where black will be able to build up. 

Which will turn into the reason for your defeat!];W[lj];B[ih]

;B[mm];W[mn];B[lm];W[om];B[pn];W[no];B[lk];W[mj]C[Hon: White found a way into the lower side, but black's corner got solidified, which is a pity. White had ways to prevent this! 

In a running fight the major direction should be to get out. Ataries or captures and stuff are only important when they help the mission - getting out.

If getting out does help the opponent too much, just live locally! E13 then B19, way earlier.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[lp]C[Hon: It is a bit funny that black still hunts this group, although it can live so easily, and that white still runs away with it. :)]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[df]C[Hon: This is another case of "family feud". In this situation it is not even necessary, since the eye was already safe!]
;B[cg];W[mp];B[lo];W[lq];B[mq];W[nq];B[kq];W[mr];B[lr]

(;W[op]C[Hon: This move only helps black to solidify points.]
;B[pq];W[kp];B[mq];W[kh];B[lq];W[or];B[sb];W[sc]C[Hon: Ambitious. :)

I do not think that this group can die.]
(;B[se];W[og];B[sf];W[qk];B[qb];W[sa];B[rg]C[Hon: If you find threats that are as large as this group, then you can fight this ko. Black has a lot to lose!]
;W[sh];B[rf];W[rm]C[Hon: But this is also fine.];B[rn];W[rl]

(;W[lh]C[Hon: Huh?];B[nr];W[oq];B[os]C[Hon: What a pity.];W[km]
C[Hon: Oops! :)];B[jn]C[Hon: You lost a lot by wriggling with your center group so far. 

Now it's hard to find a way to destroy the bottom enough.]
(;W[fq]C[Hon: This would be good if it worked, but eyespace is not likely.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[dn]C[Hon: From here on it is clearly over. 

Altogether white has lost too much at the bottom, because he missed several opportunities to just settle his group quickly, and when he was settled, he missed that he was, so he went on strengthening black.

Let us summarize the decisive strategic implications in this game: 

- the concept of family feuds (and the opposite concept of inducing)
- the difference of junk- and crucial stones
- the importance of major influence points (J7)
- the importance of taking clean life (or clean kill) when it is there

This is the part which can be learned by analysis alone.

On the other hand, for fighting players like you, it is essential to constantly practice life and death and tesuji. You can consider this the muscle training of Go. If you are not strong, and if your technique is bad, you can not win fights. But strength and technique do not grow by analysis, but only by consequent daily reading training.

I am talking about tsumego right now. :)

Here some recommendations, books which will help your go dramatically:

Richard Bozulich: One Thousand and One Life and Death Problems
Richard Bozulich: Get Strong at Tesuji
James Davies: Tesuji
James Davies: Life and Death

In Go fighting it is essential that you are fully aware of the status of each group, and that you instantly spot the moves that hurt the opponent or give relieve to yourself. And tsumego is a very effective way to acquire those skills!

I hope this review will help you, and I wish you luck with battling your way out of the losing streak!]

(;W[kr]C[Hon: Here you can start a ko fight. If you win,you have destroyed the lower side. In case of emergency you can always live with B19, so you are not in so great a danger.

You should at least find some threats, for example against the top left group.]

(;B[lm]C[Hon: This should be his move, if he wants to play here.]
))
(;W[nl]C[Hon: Just get out, which is the matter at hand ...]
;B[ok];W[qk]C[Hon: ... and as a nice side effect give yourself a good excuse to guard another weak point. 

This is the opposite concept to family feuds and it's called "inducing". You want to play a move, but it seems too slow, so you first play a move that forces your opponent to make you make the move you wanted to make in the first place! 

While a family feud is built from the sequence 1.) your move 2.) answer 3.) other group's damage, an inducing sequence (should we call it clan alliance? ^^) looks like 1.) your move 2.) answer 3.) other group's profit. 

Another valuable concept to apply in your games, but not easy to use!]

(;W[fp]C[Hon: I would take this. Black still didn't answer your approach, so it's natural to take the initiative here.

Lower right is still wide open, so you will have no trouble entering there.]

;W[ba]C[Hon: ... you find a second eye in the corner.];B[kl]
C[Hon: Continuing to surround you now would leave you sente to at least invade the bottom.

After missing J7, which was a crucial point of influence, I think it was one just to do this and live and thereby dismiss of all weakness problems.]

(;W[lk]C[Hon: This is another option. You threaten the top center group ...]

))
(;W[im]C[Hon: I think it would be better to go on and jump out. 

You want to spoil his bottom side. If you give him the crucial cap at J7, he can push you around and take the bottom. The bottom compared with his two stones in the upper right ... which is bigger?]
;B[gn]C[Hon: Black is likely to jump out further, and maybe it is good to do yet another jump.]
;W[io]C[Hon: Of course he will live, but his stones are not doing a lot, since your left side group is already alive. The lower left corner is also still open. But most important is, that you spoiled his lower side now and he will not be able to get a large moyo anymore.]

(;W[ld]C[Hon: If you play this move, it is sente against the top left, and you tidy up the upper right.

If you don't play it, then black can live in sente. This place is really big!]

(;W[gb]C[Hon: And this move kills the group directly but leaves aji at the top right.

Which way you may choose (I prefer to capture, since then you have no running group anymore), you should not let black play here first.]
))
(;B[lc]C[Hon: This looks strong. White won't have an easy time to handle this.

The ensuing variations are long, and I am not sure about the result. But if we just look at the position as it stands, then we can say that if white can not connect his two top groups, he will be in major trouble.]

There must be a dozen variations, who could ever read this out? :)]
)))
(;B[ic]C[Hon: Like this black captures your two cutting stones at G16 and his stones in the center are safely connected. Also the life of the whole group can not be questioned anymore. 

If you had not damaged the top group with your move, you could hunt a weak group in the center now!]
))
(;W[if]C[Hon: This is better. Now you will never have to worry about getting hunted across the board. 

You capture the cutting stones and save two groups with one move. This will be helpful, since you will now have a free hand when it comes to spoiling black's moyo at the bottom.

I am not sure if you know it yet, but do you know the difference between "crucial stones" and "junk stones"? 

Every group can be sacrificed, no matter how large it is, if it has no strategic function. You only lose the points of the prisoners. But sometimes a single stone can be way more valuable than 10 or 20 stones in another place. Black's stones at G15 are such stones.

You have a running group in the upper left, and your stones at the top look a bit weakish. If black finds a way to isolate them, you will have two running groups, and black will be able to hunt you and claim the whole bottom for himself in the process. But if you capture these stones, then with one strike you connect your groups, you get one safe eye minimum, and you're safe, strong and extremely thick. You will never feel the need to look back and be afraid about the top.

Try in your games to identify this difference - which stones are crucial, and which are junk, that is, pure territorial value without any strategic function.]
;B[cm];W[bg]C[Hon: This should be no trouble, since black's group is also weak. Plus: black's upper side is not alive yet!]
))
(;W[df]C[Hon: Where will he defend now first?

Black's move at E16 was starting a family feud against the top left group, and now he's in trouble.

On the other hand ...];B[cg]C[Hon: ... when he connects, your left side group also gets weakened, so you could say that you also started a family feud!]
;W[gb]C[Hon: Anyway, killing here is nice, and black still has to defend his group on the left side.

I am sure you're beginning to see now how important the concept of the family feud is?]
))
(;W[fg]C[Hon: Just jump out here!

Like this you do not help the enemy and keep him weak on both sides.]
;B[he]C[Hon: If he goes out here now, while you did not help him to do so, you have a free hand and can defend against it ...]
;W[gb]C[Hon: ... like this. Black dies and you get closer to winning the game.]
)
(;W[gb]C[Hon: Another option would be to block directly, which kills black's stones and thereby helps your own corner group.

This is the way family members should treat each other!];B[gf]
C[Hon: But I prefer the other variation, because the block allows black to surround your corner stones. If he can force you to take the top group off the board, then he will get stronger with his upper left group.

Anyway, the basic, important thing here is that you do not atari from one side and thereby weaken the other. Sharpen your attention for family feuds!]
))
(;B[gd]C[Hon: Now he could try to have it both ways.

It is still playable for you, you get out at F14 and he still has two weak groups, but when an opportunity to confine him is there, you should take it.]
))
(;W[gd]C[Hon: He came out left, you confine him right. Strike with resolution!]

(;B[dg]C[Hon: If black comes out here ...];W[gd]C[Hon: ... you just cover the other group.]

))
(;W[df]C[Hon: Here you should play this move. 

Playing E15 is good when there is no stone at C12, but when you can confine him solidly you should do so!

But I am sure the absoluteness of this move is obvious to you now that you see it.]

(;B[dg];W[cg];B[cc];W[ce];B[dc]C[Hon: This is one typical joseki for this situation.]
)
