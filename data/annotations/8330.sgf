C[Hi there.  My name is Michael.  I'll be reviewing your game today.

Some thoughts, you should probably work on your basic fighting.  One mistake I noticed from you multiple times was not extending from a cross cut.  Overall, I think you did very well in this game, and it was close right up until the end.

I suggest reading up on tesuji and joseki.  Your middle game isn't that bad for your rank.  I would suggest thinking about the whole board and not making too many weak groups.  Keep at it, every game, whether it's a win or loss is a learning opportunity.  If you have any questions or feedback regarding this review let me know: OmnipotentEntity@gmail.com]
