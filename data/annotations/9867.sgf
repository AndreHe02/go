C[Hello dear reviewer,

Thank you very much for reviewing this game. Playing as white I was brutally destroyed by someone who seemed a lot stronger than me, despite being the same rank, 14k on Tygem. Basically the game seemed lost after I messed up trying to punish strange spacing by black in the opening. I'm really curious about this game though, because of how badly that sequence went. Curious about ways to approach that spacing by black (which is, although really strange in that situation, encountered against the mini chinese fuseki, isn't it? I've never played against that one though).
The game only has 111 moves, about 30 of which are just desperate cheapos by me trying to get back into the game. I hope you can give me a clue as to what could be wrong with my thinking in terms of basic principles, that led to such a desaster for me in this game. I'm also really curious how to handle the strange opening by black.]

C[Hi Jon,

my name is Joerg, am about 4 kyu, and happy to review your game.

Until here the game is all fine. C14 is ok, I'd prefer F3.]
;B[ch];W[cc]C[now you see why. The C12 move was a good choice of black, as black has already stones on the top.

White E14 would be mor favourable joseki for White.]
(;B[cd]C[As black already has a stone on L17, D17 would better for black. (See variation.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[fc];B[qn]C[very normal opening so far, but I'm not sure about this move. Black seemed to be playing for influence somewhat, he has a wall and a 4-4 stone to develop from. However he chooses to destroy the tiny potential I might have on that side instead.

This black move is analagous to white at C14. The difference is that black has more space to extend on the right side.

I'd prefer O3 to R6.];W[nq]C[The pincer white R8 would be the better choice. This way white makes it too easy for black to settle.]
;B[rp]C[Maybe I shouldn't play R3 here? Not quite sure. It certainly can't be a big mistake, but...]

(;W[qq]C[Not the only move, maybe I should consider other choices here.]
;B[qi]C[Now that's weird spacing... What do I do to punish this? Allowing Q8 (that is best shape for black locally, isn't it?) seems good for black, giving him good shape and also slight pressure on my top right corner. However I probably choose the wrong invasion point to punish this. Read somewhere that a 3 space extension in this joseki becomes a very good result for white. Thought I'd try the same move I would do against that one...
After the game I noticed that this is found in the mini-chinese fuseki, where the s4-r3 exchange is sometimes played. I've never played against the mini-chinese though. Is there a way (or a need?) to punish this move right now?

Without lots of thinking, I just would go for R8. So let's see how things develop. Black should have played R9.]
;W[ql]C[don't know what's best here. Maybe I'm overestimating the value of Q8 for black and should instead play the lower left corner, maybe R9 or Q8 are better ways to invade... maybe my move is good but I messed up the followup...

It was right to invade now. This is the most urgent region to play now.]
;B[pl]C[the most agressive answer black has. No idea what to do here, he wants to make me read which I can't do (or he plays this regularly, also possible).
In any case black seems to be playing with his food this game...

Well, reading is important but also difficult. Don't get confused by weird/unexpected move. Most often the opponent is just clueless and wants to provoke a mistake on your side.

If reading is not possible (e.g. time constraints), just follow basic principles: black stones must be separated.]

(;W[qm]C[bad move based on wrong reading. Still no idea what's the right one though, nothing I came up with after the game was good for white.

this cannot work. Also it obviously forces white's invasion into a defensive position (thick position).]
;B[pm]C[obvious move.];W[rn];B[ro]
(;W[qo]C[the cute at Q6 looks more attracive to me.];B[pn]C[and now connecting at S7 is a desaster, so I decide to push first assuming he will respond and then try to kill the corner...]
;W[qk]C[the situation has now turned very bad for white: the group at R8 has to struggle for life and all black stones are connected.]
;B[rm]C[but black doesn't respond.

He is right.];W[pk];B[ok];W[pi]C[not sure about this move. In any case the hane at P10 didn't seem to end well for me. This move is aiming at that.

This is the right move here.];B[ph];W[oi]C[but I decide to play this instead... probably not the best choice, because although it solves the problem of the black atari at P11, the cut is now worrysome.

This move was right.];B[qg]C[good move by black thretening to cut at Q10 and at the same time attacking my top right corner.

Yes, this is very nice idea from black.]
(;W[nk]C[this move defends the cut, but it's not a good one... black can even play P10 if he wants, I think.

This looks like trick play. I would always consider first a straight forward solution.]

(;B[ol]C[but this threatens to cut again and I have to fix anyway.]
;W[oj]C[I guess O9 for P8 is a good exchange for me though, in this position.

I am not so sure about this.];B[qj]C[exactly. Balck can now play this move which is painful for white.]
;W[pj];B[rf]C[and the game is basically over right now. I have two weak groups and no potential for territory anywhere, black will gain a lot by attacking me and win easily.

I do not agree. Yes, white has a disadvantage. But it takes long before a groups dies. In this situation, white should not only always react on black's moves, but take initiative. White will definitely loose if he defends now the group on top right. Why not couterattack the group on the bottom right, which still has no eyes.]

;W[rq]C[my wall is useless, unless I get to attack black's lower right group, which isn't reasonable, but seems like my last chance.

It is extremely reasonable!];B[gq]C[Black doesn't even feel the need to respond. At this point the game is really over.

Why? Black should feel the need. So it is black's mistake not to respond.]

(;W[jp]C[bad move trying to convince black that I'm going to attack him...

White is still only reacting. Easy play for black.];B[jr]C[not sure if this is good, but in this position black could even pass and still be winning by a lot.

K2 looks strange and is definitely not a good move here. C4 would be e.g. a great move or G15.]
;W[sp]C[what is this good for?];B[cl]C[black ignores again. And again I think black's spacing is strange. I would have expected c5 instead. Is this move better?

No, it is not perfect. But indeed, black can ignore white's last move which is meaningless. Any move on the C-line secures lots of territory for black.]
;W[km]C[still trying to convince black to defend...

How did you come up with exactly L7? Is there a plan behind this or just random play?]
;B[sn];W[rl];B[nl];W[mk]C[sad move, admitting that there never was a threat against this group.

I do not agree. This move is necessary.];B[no]

C[I am really desperate and choose to play ko for life instead of living in gote.]

(;W[eo]C[life in the corner is more urgent (see variation)]
;B[ap];W[aq];B[bq];W[bf]C[ko-threat is too small];B[ar]C[black of course ignores that. At this point I'm about to resign. Try a few more moves and finally let it go.

Yes, it would be time to resign.];W[ef];B[ec];W[fd];B[af];W[bg]
;B[fb];W[db];B[eb];W[ba]C[if you showed this fighting spirit from the beginning, it would be hard for black.]
;B[fe];W[dh];B[ci]C[white resigns.
Thank you for reviewing my game, hope it wasn't too sad, since it's very onesided, but I want to know if my mindset was wrong or if I just misread and that cost me the game. Looking forward to your advice.

Well, it wasn't too sad ;-) I think it is more the mindset than the reading. I hope my review comment help.]
