C[Hagios: Hello; this game showed a few areas you might consider improving.  The fighting was not very good for black, and you missed a few key points in this game.  I'll do my best to provide helpful comments.]

;B[dp];W[cn];B[fn];W[em];B[cq];W[bp]LB[fq:A]C[I did not expect this move. I guess the stone at D7 has a bit more aji than in the usual joseki, but what should one aim for?

H: This joseki allows black to make use of d7, so I'd avoid harming it.  The prescribed play is at A]

(;B[dr];W[qn]C[H: I feel W needed another move in the left.]
;B[nq];W[qk]
(;B[ce]LB[ce:B][dm:A]C[was this the right choice? It did not feel good when I got pincered.

H: This offers a double attack against the stones at A and B.  I'd avoid offering such a gift]

[jc:C][dm:A][hp:D][jp:E][rp:F]C[H: This was needed due to the aji of A

This is a delicate moment.  Black now can give thought to the whole board state.  I see the following areas as interesting:

B is the normal extension of white after f16, so taking it or C (optimal extension from black's hoshi stone) is reasonable.
D is weak, so attacking around E is interesting.
F is an important point in the unfinished joseki];B[hc]LB[jc:A]
[eg:B]C[maybe this is overplay...

H: I'd prefer a simple play at A, because the group at B isn't very strong yet.]
;W[ge]
(;B[ie]LB[eg:A]C[H: This doesn't assist black in making a base, but white is pushed out to help pressure the group at A.]
;W[ff];B[cc];W[ef]
(;B[dd];W[ec];B[cf]LB[ed:A]C[H: This does not create any eyeshape due to the weakness at A]
;W[gg];B[fh]C[H: This move must follow careful reading.  Can you kill any white stones?  Otherwise, this is only a heavy group.]
;W[gj];B[cj]C[too early for this?

H: It's time to find out...];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi];B[bl];W[ek];B[bg]
;W[eh];B[qf];W[qq];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro]C[H: Is this best?  Can black attack white's two stones?]
;W[rq];B[qo];W[or];B[nr];W[oq];B[op];W[np];B[lq];W[mo];B[on]
;W[kp]LB[oq:A]C[H: White's group at A is not yet alive.  This is an important shape to learn.]

(;B[jq]C[this did not feel good. is there a better was for black to play to stabilise his stones (so that white has to come back and play in the corner, and black can take sente)?

H: In this case, I would consider killing white immediately.]

Pushing white here is harmful to your position--notice that you don't have much cash yet.]

;B[ll];W[jl];B[kh];W[lg];B[jg];W[jf];B[kl];W[jj]C[unfortunately here black lost on time

H: At this point I don't think black lost the game completely, because white hasn't lived in the corner, and black might keep the moyo in the top still.  White benefitted greatly from the fighting, and feels slightly better (it's hard to keep the moyo totally black's)

I'd recommend looking into books on fighting and fuseki to further your game.]
