C[I am 2k(IGS) with black and played with another 2K with white.

I won the game as I belived my opponent escaped by disconnecting from the server.

I submit the game because at the begining of the game the bet my fortune by letting my opponent to crawl on the fifth line. I would like to know is it right to do so and should I do this next time.

Thank you in advance for your valuable comment.];B[dd];W[cp]

C[This was the start of the crawl. Should I do this again ?

My point of view is try to build the moyo while did not allow white to bend to the center to make use of his C4 stone.

klin: OK here.];B[ko];W[jp];B[jo]C[klin: You can stop here, and play at, say, Q11.]
;W[ip];B[io];W[qi]C[klin: Black failed by letting w get R11.]
;B[qg]C[Is B29 in the right direction?];W[ql]C[klin: W R8 P11 better.]
;B[ol]C[Is B31 right, but other than this I cannot figure out what can I do.

klin: P11 better];W[ho];B[hn]C[a painful bet!!

klin: Black should ignor it, attack the right group];W[go];B[gn]
C[klin: No need for this];W[fo];B[fn]C[klin: You don't know when to stop.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[jc]C[klin: Another good point occupied by white]
;B[gc]C[Again right direction of B41 or not?];W[mc];B[ne]C[klin: Bad move, should P 17]
;W[pk];B[ok]C[klin: Bad move again. B play at S9, white cannot make two eyes, will be attacked.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[oi]C[klin: Black has helped white to make eyes.]
;B[ni];W[oh];B[nc]C[I began to afraid losing the game and try to seal up some area.

klin: O18 is better than O17];W[md]C[klin: white should O18.]

C[when I play B59, I believed I could but off the W58 or W60. but W62 is realy surprised me.]
;B[qf];W[lf];B[do]C[Shoould B65 hane here or should it be on m11 or around the area of D11

klin: absoluetely should L15];W[dp];B[dn]C[klin: D6 is not needed at all, D5 stone has very little value.]
;W[ke]C[klin: Kep position occupied by w again.];B[kf];W[jf]
;B[kg];W[lg];B[jh];W[li];B[lj]C[klin: N9 better];W[kj];B[lk]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[hb];B[gb];W[hc];B[gd];W[ie];B[cj]C[Is B85 too close to the black wall. Should it be aroud C12/C13

klin: C15 better];W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bb];B[ad];W[ac]
;B[bc];W[bn]C[Did I make a right chose by ignoring the W94?]
;B[ab];W[cm];B[dl]C[klin: D8 abother useless move, H14 is the key.]
;W[jl];B[hq];W[hp]C[I believe White can ignore the B99 and B101. Am I right ?]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[cr];W[gf];B[fq];W[gi]C[klin: I cannot believe white let black make alive a big goup in the lower side.]
;B[gh];W[fh];B[fi];W[fj];B[ei];W[gg];B[hh];W[dg]C[klin: white misses a chance, if plays at H11, center black group has only 5 liberties. Black cut at F13, white can get more than 5 liberties by extends to the side.]
;B[gj];W[gk]C[klin: black escaped. No comments beyond this point.]

C[When I play B175, I already know that I can seal up the left area and kill white there. Any chance for white ?]
;B[eh];W[oa]C[I thought white would play on F14 then black D14. if white at D14 then B F14 W F15 B F13 then I can cut at G15 or E15.]

White escape here.

If I can have chance to play on Q8, I believe I can get something there. Am I right.

Thank you again for your advice.])
