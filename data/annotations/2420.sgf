C[Hello, thanks for reviewing our game!  Both Tartuffe and Anglante will read the review, so comments for both players are welcome.
We have been playing Go for a few months, but we could use some advice on our play, particularly openings and tactical fights.

Peter and Dave];B[dd];W[tt];B[pp];W[tt];B[pd];W[tt];B[dp];W[nq]
;B[oq];W[np];B[po];W[jq];B[gq]TR[gq][jq]C[Anglante:  Is this too far to extend?

Migeru: The rule of thumb is: extend two spaces from one stone, three spaces from two stones. So, both marked stones are optimal extensions.

The marked black stone is both an extension from the hoshi (star-point) stone, and a pincer on (preventing an optinal extension from) the marked white stone.

Keep in mind that the large knight's move can be cut, and so can the 3-space extension.]
;W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[bo]C[Tartuffe:  Do I need to respond to black's B5?

Migeru: Eventually you will want to block at B6, but at this time that is too small a move.]
;W[fo]C[Migeru: Correct! jump ahead towards the center rather than blocking at B6.]
;B[fp];W[eo];B[ep]
(;W[ci]C[Tartuffe:  Is this overplay?  I thought that if he tried to pincer me at C8 or C9 I could fortify C11 with a move at C14 (the C6 group seems pretty safe).

Migeru: This seems indecisive, and instead of approaching Black's corner stone it allows a black extension and pincer at C13. Taking C13 yourself might have been better. Miai like C14-C8 are good when you are invading between two black stones (see variation).]

;W[pf]
(;B[pe]TR[qd]C[Migeru: Black makes bad shape here (empty triangle).]

(;W[qj]C[Migeru: You are allowing black to hane at the head of your two stones.]

(;B[hd]C[Anglante:  Is this extension too far from the edge?

Migeru: I don't think so, but this stone does not work well with the upper right corner. You are inviting an invasion around M16. Here you wish you had played Q17 at M16. See variation for move 28.]

(;W[jc]
(;B[ic]C[Migeru: Black is attacking White on the wrong (strong) side. Black should attack White from Black's weak side (the upper right corner), pushing White towards Black's strength.]
;W[nc]C[Tartuffe:  Should I have responded to H17 directly?  I thought that if he tried to pincer I could steal the corner from him, though K17 would have trouble running.

Migeru: I think this is too far from K17. Also, if what you wanted was to steal the corner, why did you play K17 in the first place?]

(;B[oc]C[Migeru: Black is being submissive. See the variations.]
;W[nd];B[nb];W[od];B[ob];W[qm];B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[hr]C[Anglante:  What would be a better play here?

Migeru: Pretty much anything. This is extremely small, it is an endgame move. There are lots of larger plays on the board, especially ones that exploit White's weak group on the upper side.]
;W[oe]C[Tartuffe:  Is sealing black off from the center a big enough move right now?  I lost sente, but it seemed like the two walls were both strengthened quite a bit.

Migeru: What two walls? But yes, this is a good move, because it patched up one of the largest weaknesses in your structure.]

(;B[re]C[Anglante:  What would have been a bigger move?

Migeru: This prevents White from playing S15, but it is another endgame move.]

(;W[jd]C[Tartuffe:  Should this have been a bigger jump?  I just didn't want to get cut and invaded.

Migeru: This is not bad, but black can't cut your 1-space jump. See variation.]

(;B[ib]C[Migeru: Another endgame move. Play towards the center, not towards the edge.]
;W[id];B[he]
(;W[jf]C[Tartuffe:  I left N18 and K18 open to attack, since it seemed like miai, and the center was becoming more important.  Is this correct?

Migeru: N18 is more urgent than K18, but still too small. Also, you can jump farther.]
;B[eg];W[hg];B[gf];W[gg];B[fg];W[ho]
(;B[gh]C[Anglante:  How could I respond to H5 to allow access to the center?

Migeru: The obvious moves to try are G5 and J4, but they don't seem to work. See the variations.]

C[Tartuffe:  Would a move around N18 or K18 have been bigger?

Migeru: B6 and K18 are the same size, but N18 is bigger.]
(;B[an]C[Anglante:  What would be a bigger move?

Migeru: This is a tiny move. See the variation.];W[am];B[ao]
;W[bl];B[rf];W[rg];B[mk]C[Migeru: I wonder if there is a way to capture that stone and save Black's large group. This move, pressing on the side, is actually forcing White to connect with J9, which is what he wants to do in the first place, but none of the alternatives seem to work.]
