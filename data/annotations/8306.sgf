This game I thought I was ahead at many points but some of the positions were very difficult, or perhaps I played wrong.]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[pq];W[ep];B[cp];W[qf]C[Maybe he played R14 to create a ladder breaker for the lower left joseki, I dont know.

reid: I think it's much too early to be thinking about such specific details as ladder breakers.  It looks to me like white is just trying to prevent black from getting a large right-side position.  This approach move is certainly playable for white, but then a lot of other moves are reasonable at this point also.]
(;B[dn]C[reid: this is also fine, as would be the pincer at R12 (in the variation).  But again, there are so many possibilities and variations at this time that following the variation beyond the pincer is not very helpful.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[od];W[nc]C[This move (as far as I can tell) is a mistake by white, isnt it?]
;B[qd];W[qo];B[qm]LB[qj:A][qk:C][ql:B]C[reid: OK, white missed the joseki move at R16 or S17 and played O17 (black's continuation) instead.   Black should punish white for that.  The question is how?

Looking at the R14 stones, white's ideal extension would be to A.  From the R5 stone, the extension white wants is to B.  If black plays C instead of R7, he prevents both white extensions with a single move.  Any time you can accomplish two goals with a single move, it's probably a good move.]
;W[op];B[pp];W[po];B[oo];W[oq]C[This also looks like an overplay.

reid: This is joseki.  White really doesn't have much choice after black pushes and cuts, he has to attack the corner.]
;B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[pn];B[nq];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[lp]LB[mr:A]
C[reid: White has a lot of scattered groups on the board,  I would prefer to see black play simply at A.  Now all the black groups are either very safe, or they are so small black can afford to sacrifice them (P5, R7).  White however has attackable groups at O16, R14, and E4.  White also has to worry about the cutting stone at P5.  Black could feel very comfortable.]
;W[nn];B[lo]C[reid: Sente, but I think it's too early.  After white responds with N6 of P6, black's aji is reduced considerably.

Black M5 would be good if black could count on taking the entire botton side as a result.  But in this game, the right side (extending to R10 or R11) is more important.  Also, white has the M3 aji so it's very difficult for black to take the bottom side.

Better to leave M5 for now and see how the game develops.];W[mn]
;B[qi];W[og];B[ng];W[oi];B[rh];W[qg]LB[rd:C][rg:A][qh:B]C[reid: White is probaly better off blocking with A.  It give black a sente at B, but that's not a very helpful sente.  White on the other had has an almost sente eye at C later.]
;B[pk];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr];B[ns];W[jq]LB[nk:A]C[reid: It looks too soon for white to take advantage of the M3 aji.  The white O6 stones are pretty safe (one eye already and access to the center), but the P13 group has no base, and O16 is not very stable.  A black attack around H3 would be painful also.  White has too many irons in the fire.

If I were black, I would want to play around A to keep the groups separated.]
;B[iq]LB[se:A]C[I didnt read all of it but I though this tesuji worked (ie: he cant hane at J4)

reid:  The black M5 stones are very close to some pretty strong white stones which means they are rather weak.  Attacking K3 directly is probably an overplay.  Instead, black should be looking at the bigger target: the P11 group.  By attacking these, he might be able to pull out the M5 stones in a natural way (perhaps black L6 or K5 will work as the attack progresses).  Then an attack at H3 would follow in due course.]
;W[jp];B[ip];W[jo]C[reid: Black is pushing from behind here - rarely a good idea.   The critical M5 stones are getting swallowed up, and black is probably not going to be able to swallow E4 in exchange (white C3 leads to at least one eye for white already).  These exchanges are helping white more than they help black.]
;B[io];W[en];B[dm];W[gn];B[jn];W[kn];B[in];W[em]LB[km:A]C[reid: Hmm, now white is pushing from behind.  Why does white want this move?  It's difficult to find a good attacking move for black.  Instead, white should keep the black stones weak by defending at A (L7).  Black can't attack the G6 stones while his own J6 stones are at risk.]
;B[kq];W[kr];B[ln];W[lm];B[ko];W[ir];B[km]C[Did I use the aji at M4 correctly here?

reid: Well, you saved the M4 cutting stone which is important,  But see the comments a few moves later (move 69)]
;W[hq];B[jr]C[This wasn't very useful for black, I think.];W[js]
;B[kp]LB[mo:A][no:B]C[reid:  This might be the move that costs black the game.  Later on, black cannot atari some white stones at A because a white connection at B is a counter-atari.  The liberty at L4 is far more valuable than the three points black saves by connecting.

This is perhaps the most important lesson in this game:  don't make endgame moves until you get to the endgame.  Yes, it's sente, and it's three free points.  But if your opponent wants to take those three points in gote at this stage of the game, you should be more than happy to give them to him.  Save that liberty!]
;W[jr];B[gp];W[gq];B[ll];W[mm];B[kk];W[nk];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok]
;W[mk];B[nh];W[pi]C[Here I thought I was going to kill one of his groups.

reid: It certainly seems likely.  However, instead of assuming you will kill a group, it is safer to play such that you are in a good position even if all his groups manage to survive.  In other words, play so that a kill is a nice treat, but not necessary for the win.  Looking at the territory so far, black seems well ahead.  It's not necessary to gamble on the kill.]
(;B[oh]C[I pushed here because I didnt want him to make an eye.

reid: White needs both P12 and R12 to make an eye here.  As long as both those moves are gote, black doesn't have to worry.  And of course, black is losing a liberty here.

Note that R12 suddenly turns into sente if black has S13.  And S13 itself threatens an eye if white doesn't answer (white S16 next).  So instead of black R10 (as in the variation), black might want to play at S10.]

;B[rl];W[rn];B[rp];W[qh];B[ro];W[qn];B[ri];W[rg];B[qp];W[sl]
;B[sn];W[sm];B[sk];W[so];B[eq]C[This is just a desperate attempt.

reid: If black still had a libertiy at L4, he coiuld have played at T5 instead of T9.  The white R6 stones then have three liberties while the black S9 group has four - easy win for black.

I think the most important lesson in this game is: don't rush to make endgame moves.  Just because a move is sente it doesn't mean it's a good move.  If black had not made the L4/K2 exchange, the result would be very different.

Secondarily, it seems to me that both black and white were rushing a lot of their moves.  There were a log of unstable groups left hanging.

Go is a game that rewards patience.  Take the time to reinforce your groups before you attack.  Attacking while you have weak groups is a gamble.  Attacking when your groups are strong gives you control and freedom.

Good luck, play strong - reid];W[fp];B[fq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cq]
