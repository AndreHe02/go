C[PG :  Black should complete the joseki in the upper right by playing at 'a' or 'b':  either move is sente. On the other hand, if White gets to 'a' first, I feel  Black would get very little out of this area.]
;W[po]
(;B[qo]L[np]C[PG : the  usual way to play the Chinese style fuseki and use the stone at R9 is to play  at 'a' instead. (See variation B)]
;W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr]L[pn][or][qq]C[jc1> Joseki dictionary says  a, b or c gives the avalanch joseki.  Q2 is  not mentioned.

I don't know the avalanch josekis so I just played Q2.


PG : I see a lot of people play Q2 but I do not really know if it is good or  bad. I would suspect the latter since White gets to settle himself easily in  Black's zone of inluence. One problem I see with Q2 is that P2 will later be  sente for White.


In any case, playing this way (that is securing the corner area and letting  White get outside influence) is not to my liking : the Black stone at K4 has  lost most of its meaning.


I checked out all variations given by the D.O.B.J. and none seems to give  Black a satisfactory result considering his initial position.]
;W[pn];B[jj]C[jc1> k10 gives me influence and is a ladder break for the cut at p4.  I'm  happy with this move.


PG : I am not so happy with this move :-). True, it gives influence and sets  up a ladder but also seems to be aji-keshi. I would prefer to see the ladder  be set up later on by starting a fight around D16.]
;W[np];B[fp];W[dn];B[dq];W[cq];B[eq]C[jc1> trying to be consistent with k4 and k10 I played a  influence orient
ed joseki at f4.];W[cr];B[mq];W[qc];B[qd];W[cj];B[jd]M[me]L[fc][ok]
C[jc1> perhaps n15 is  better than k16.

PG : I think K16 is fine but would prefer an approach move at 'a' instead.


N15 is also interesting, setting up a large moyo, but the timing may be  wrong; it seems necessary to play at 'b' before.]
;W[ne];B[ng]L[fc][ok]C[PG : Consistent with N3 but the upper side seems more important  now. I would consider an approach move at 'a' instead or once again 'b'.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[ol];B[nn]L[mp]C[PG : since it is unlikely that Black can kill White  here, simply playing at 'a' to build territory would be better.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[mm];B[lo];W[mn];B[qm];W[ok];B[mk]L[oj]C[PG : same comment again. 'a'  seems better.]
;W[oj];B[ph]L[pi]C[PG : This is hard to assess but I think 'a'  would be better shape: Black has a lot of cutting points in his position.]
;W[dc]L[hd][df]C[PG : Dangerous since White is not alive yet in the lower right. Also  it is too slow at this stage of the game. 'a' or 'b' would get my vote if  tenuki is really ok in the lower right.]
;B[fm]L[fd]C[PG : This is  wrong: Black seems to be stacking the game on killing the White group. A play  at 'a' or at some nearby intersection is urgent to settle the top.]
;W[hd];B[ej];W[jf];B[lg];W[ie];B[le]C[jc1> there is a lot of space of the top to work  with if k16 gets cut off. I think I should have invaded the right with c14 or  c13.


PG : This move seems correct. Giving up the stone would be too much: almost  all of the top area would become sure territory. Also, Black now has  prospects of harassing the White group in the upper right later in the  endgame to pick up some points.]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[eh]L[di]C[PG : 'a' is the  correct shape here. Black would then have to defend his cutting point.]
;B[fh];W[fg];B[fj]C[jc1> I'm pleased with how the f10 group is working with k10  and f7.]
;W[ck];B[lc]L[ll][km]C[jc1> if I kill the bottom right white group I  have the game wrapped up. I should concentrate on this instead of playing  M17. Perhaps l7 or r8.


PG : Right. But there is not need to kill that group. It is only necessary to  seal it in. 'a' or 'b' would seem appropriate in that respect.]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[km];B[jn];W[fs];B[fr];W[es];B[ds];W[dr];B[er]C[jc1> oops.  70 should be  at g1.

PG : indeed. This is costly.];W[gs];B[hr];W[gg];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb]
;B[jh]L[ha][dm][sc]C[jc1> I should be putting the BR white group on ice instead of playing k12  :^(.


PG : Any sente move would be better than this. 'a', 'b' or 'c' are  possibilities. Sealing in the white group is also good.]
;W[kk];B[lk];W[jm];B[ln];W[lm];B[im];W[il];B[hm];W[kj];B[jk];W[jl];B[mi]
L[ql]C[PG  : Does not seem necessary but I could be missing something. 'a' is the move I  would play.]
;W[ql]L[qn][rm]C[jc1> arrrrghhh. I should have played at b not a. 'b'  definitely (? :^) prevents white from getting an eye on the right :^).  
Variation B looks dead.


PG : Variation B didn't make it all the way here :-) I agree that 'b' is  more solid.]

;W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rm];W[rl];B[rh];W[si]C[jc1> I think I'm  behind now but not hopeless.]
