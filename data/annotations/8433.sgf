Hi, my nickname on IGS is v4hn.
I did this game a couple of days ago playing white.
Actually this is a game with 1 + 5 minutes byoyomi per 25,
so there are a lot of small mistakes, which don't need to be commented.
(If you find some very troublesome mistakes, it'd be nice,
if you'd mention them anyway).
I mostly want this game to be commented on general tactics,
because there are a number of situations, when I didn't know
what to do next and I feel like I messed up and just won
because my opponent made some big mistakes in the late middle game.

******************************************
Hi, I come from Germany (3k on KGS)
Your game is not easy to comment, but
interesting. I hope you enjoy the lines °°

This were the main mistakes, I think:

Some sequences at your game are
incompletely. You have play them out
before play on another part of the board.
(Missing R5, N3 or Q10)

If your opponent play weak, attack him!
(Especially the botton group H3 you have
to attack earlier)

Look at the biggest points on the board
before make a (small) piece of territory.

;W[dq];B[cj];W[op]LB[pe:A][cg:B]C[Which corner to approach?
I decided for this one hoping to establish influence towards the left,
so approaching with D5 might become unattractable(see variation)

**R**
Your P4 seems OK to me. (see var)
You can play A or B too.]
(;B[pq];W[oq];B[jq]LB[po:A]C[**R**
K3 is funny. A is joseki for black. Now white should shut him into the corner.]
;W[cn]C[Since he took the central bottom, I established a strong group with some
territory on the left and wanted to attack the left stone.

**R** C6 is locally not bad, but at first you have to handle with your P4 group. If black ignore C6 and play around Q5, your group becomes much weaker and he can stable his K3 stone and gets some profit on the right side. (see var)]
(;B[cg]
(;W[qn]LB[po:A]C[Since my stones at P3 are weak I wanted to confine
black to the corner or at least strengthen my two stone,
when he tries to escape with Q5.

**R** You should play R5 (see var). If you want to save a group, you have to play contact moves. If black could play Q5, he is happy]
(;B[mr];W[nr]LB[or:A][pr:B]C[**R**
This is a mistake. If you play A, white can no longer play B as sente. His corner AND the K3 group comes then under pressure.]
;B[pr];W[qo];B[rr];W[pp];B[rp];W[gq]C[So he even let me connect the right side in sente
or is P6 needed here for good shape?
But what to do next?
I decided for this extension because it attacks the two stones
as well. But now it looks like Q15 i.e. would be much bigger?

**R**
At first you has to attack the weak black K3 "group".
(G3 must at H3 before) 
After you attack him, you can play the big point Q15.
P6 is not necessary. Black is too weak here to
attack you.];B[hr]
(;W[gr]LB[hq:A]C[**R**
Here to play A is important. (see var).];B[hq]
(;W[fd]LB[jc:C][be:B][pe:A][qg:D]C[Same problem here!
Everything looks quite fine the way it is,
so where to gain territory best?
I decided to grep some here,
but since 4,4 is moyo I now feel stupid with
playing only a 1-space jump.

**R**
I prefer A here (see var), but F16 is not bad.
(B is too small here)
If black later plays a enclosure with A, you can
get the nice points C or D here.];B[bd];W[cc];B[ic];W[bf]LB[bc:A]
[be:B][pe:C]SQ[ic][pc]C[Since I didn't know where to defend best against J17
I attacked the left side first...

**R**
Why so complicated? A is good enough.
The profit, black gets is very small.
If black ignores it, you can save your
corner with B every time and he gets 
a weak group again.
The marked stones are too loose for
direct territory, so (after saving your corner)
you can invade easily or play C.];B[cf];W[be];B[ce];W[cd];B[bg]
;W[ad];B[fb]
(;W[hb]LB[pe:A]C[I suppose this was a big mistake.
He decided to sacrifice F18 for influence towards the right,
but would the variation be something to hope for as well?

**R**
There is no reason for H18. Your corner is save.
A is still the biggest point on the board. (see var)];B[hc]
;W[gb];B[gc];W[fc]
(;B[ib];W[eb];B[ha];W[fa];B[af];W[bc];B[lc];W[qe]LB[pf:A][qf:B]
C[And again I got sente with no real idea what to do...

Since the top right is pretty strong,
I saw no point in approaching high at Q15
and went with the low approach hoping to grep some territory
on the right side or duck into the corner.
Obviously both failed and I again got outward influence...

**R**
This is the right direction for playing.

But black is strong, so A or B are better shimari here.];B[qd]
(;W[pe]LB[pd:B][rd:A][qh:C]C[Is this stone needed or could I have played Q10/12 instead?

**R**
A shoulder move like R16 you have to answer.
But black is strong at the top and the bottom, so you
have to prepare for a invasion.
Thats why a sente sequence like A-C looks better for me. (see var)

Another option is to strenghten your Q15 group,
then the P4 group and play then the capping
move at P11. But this is not easy to handle.];B[qi];W[oh];B[pg]
;W[ph];B[qh];W[qg];B[rg];W[og];B[qf];W[pf];B[qg];W[nf];B[nd]
;W[re]C[Since he defended the top territory I at least wanted to cut his groups here.]
;B[ql]C[I saw no point in making territory with the lower group anyway,
since he can always jump to T7...]
(;W[on]C[**R**
P6 is too passive!
If you let black into the center this is a big loss.

If black can install a  position here
you have to hold him small. (see var)];B[mq];W[rk]LB[pj:A][pk:B]
C[I wanted to reduce territory, but outward influence looks much
better now..

**R**
Black can no gain territory here. (Maybe 6 points or so)
After preparation of A and B this move is an option.
Here it is too early.];B[qk];W[rl];B[rj];W[rm];B[ol]CR[rk][rl]
[rm][on][qn][qo][op][pp][oq][nr]TR[pe][qe][re][nf][pf][og][oh]
[ph]C[**R**
NOW black go into the center and split you in two!

OK, you can live easyly, but there is no more territory
at the right side and no influence at the center.
Now it will be a hard game for white.];W[rc]LB[nl:B][mm:A]C[Here again I didn't know what to play next and decided
on this local move.

**R**
At the moment black hasn't two eyes, so you has the
option to fight with A or B. Try to connect your
two groups.
S17 is endgame. Think of the weakness of your
two groups is important. (Thats why N3 was
a important point in your late opening)

Normally black should win this game,
but his endgame was bad...
(I see no center territory for white ^^)
