AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Commented by Niall (ProboViro on KGS), currently 2k at the request
of black. Reviewer's comments marked with "N".

Q: I'm especially interested to know if my territorial oriented opening was OK and get some tips how to handle the resulting influence of the opponent.]
;W[dd];B[jp];W[nc];B[qf];W[pc];B[qc];W[od];B[pb]C[N: I would have played Q15]
;W[pe];B[oc];W[ob];B[qe];W[ne]C[N: I'm a bit surprised W didn't take the ko, but this is OK for him.]
;B[pc]C[Q: Is the result in the upper right korner OK for me? I felt reasonably good about it, since I got corner territory, a possibility to develop the right and a good endgame option at O18.

N: W comes out with better prospects than B, but it's not disastrous. And B's territory is totally solid.]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[cp];B[cq];W[do];B[ep]C[N: yes, definitely better here.]
;W[hp];B[ho]C[N: Not good, tends to leave W too strong on the outside. I would attack much more vigirously at J5.]
;W[io];B[ip];W[go]C[N: Now if you really want to stir is up, pull out H5, since you're solid in the corner.]
;B[gp];W[hn];B[hq];W[fo]C[N: ...which leaves W with a lot of thickness]
;B[bp];W[mp];B[co];W[dn]C[Q: again I was happy with corner and fourth-line territory. Is my result reasonable?

N: no. You've got about 30 points - having started off with 2 stones there. And W's influence is potentially worth more.]
;B[jo]C[Q: Maybe this move was small? I intended to put pressure on N4.

N: I would first of all play B6, and then dive into the developing W moyo, something like C11. This is nice shape, but small at this stage.]
;W[jn];B[pn]C[N: That's fine.];W[ql];B[qm]C[N: I would play R10 here, which puts pressure on R8 and also makes 8 points or so of territory.]
;W[pl];B[qi]C[Q: I wanted to make territory while preventing R8 from getting a base. Perhaps this was not effective, as R8 has plenty of strong stones to run to?

N: No, it's fine in that way - so long as you don't delude yourself that you can actually kill them. But the problem is the previous exchange has left you a weak point at R5.]
;W[rj]C[N: ... which you should have mended immediately, e.g. by playing S7 now.]
;B[ri];W[rm]C[N: You were lucky!];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[oi];B[kn]
;W[jm];B[km]C[N: If the objective is to kill N64 you should play N6 now, but if you're also eyeing up the moyo, this is fine.]
;W[mn];B[pj];W[oj];B[cf]C[N: I would be tempted to play M5 to guard the cutting point first.]
;W[ch];B[fc]C[N: This is OK, though I prefer F16.];W[fd];B[cc]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd]C[N: I think you have to answer E17 first.]
;W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[eb];W[gc];B[ed];W[ee]C[Q: perhaps I chose the wrong sequence for the overall board position, since white gets a huge moyo. But even locally the result in this corner does not seem satisfactory, because white is going to shut me in and I end up with only about 10 points of territory. What did I do wrong?

N: see my remarks about the W wall on the 5th line: this is the consequence! But it is not disastrous: the moyo will need quite a lot of work to turn it into territory, and you could make a vague play like J10.]
;B[gd];W[ec];B[fb];W[gb];B[ed];W[fe];B[ec]C[N: No, definitely you should ignore the ko and play H16.]
;W[hd];B[kl];W[jk];B[kj]C[N: too thin];W[kk];B[jl];W[il];B[lk]
;W[ik];B[ll];W[nm];B[ok];W[nk];B[pk];W[lj];B[ol];W[nl];B[om]
;W[mj]C[Q: this is the point where I first was happy about having cought some stones and then thought that I probably was loosing the game. Do I overestimate white's moyo or have I really spoiled more than the three handicap stones by now? How should I deal with the moyo - is the kind of invasion I tried sensible?

N: Yes, I agree you're losing now. You've traded the chance to reduce the moyo for 17 points on the side. But there are things to be tried.]
;B[bf]C[N: and this is one possibility, though if W simply replies D15 you don't get that much.]
;W[ae];B[df];W[de];B[cj]C[N: OK, why not try it?];W[eh];B[bh]
C[N: I would jump out and keep this for later.];W[bi];B[ci]
;W[bg];B[bj]C[N: no, you must play D12 which connects your stones in sente.]
;W[ah];B[dh]C[N: pointless.];W[dg];B[bm]C[N: the trouble about this move is that you throw away the possibility of B6 followed by C7, which becaome real once you have a ladder-breaker somewhere near E9.]
;W[bn];B[cm];W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[ak]C[Q: from now on I thought my invasion would die and I would not have many chances left to win the game. Somehow I saw the sequence finally leading to Seki only right before I played it. Somehow I overlooked that I could threaten to connect.]

;B[ij]C[N: I think that B10 would now kill the B group.];W[ji]
;B[jj];W[ki];B[gk];W[gl];B[an];W[ao];B[am];W[bo];B[aj];W[bk]
;B[bl];W[ck];B[dm];W[em]C[psittaco: Now I think that I'm ways ahed.]
;B[nq];W[ko]C[N: W can't attack until he's resolved the weakness at J7.]
;B[im];W[fk];B[in];W[kq]
(;B[ho]C[N: I think I could have done much more truble by H7. If i read correctly, I would have captured at least one part of the white group and connected the Seki to the lower side. 

N: it looks more attractive. See the branches - I can't see how W can keep you cut off and survive.]
