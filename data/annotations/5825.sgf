sronen71 [13k\]: Hi, tthank you

The board looks nice for black :)];W[nc]C[white approaches corner]

(;B[qf]C[black response by externsion - I think this is standard

CB> There are also other standard responses, see var for another example. Also, the variation may be better : a little more aggressive for black.]
;W[pb]C[white slides under]
(;B[qc]C[black protects corner - I this is called 'kite' formation]
;W[ld]C[white extends]
(;B[jd]C[black takes star point and restricts white. I think this was a good move.]
;W[gd]C[So this white move seems multi purpose:
1) pincer K16
2) approach D16
3) invasion in between

This move made me (with black stones) nervous. I'm not sure how to respond

I considered:
1) protect corner with F17
2) strengthen K16 with K17, to seperate strongly white left stone from right
3) extend corner at D14 or C14

which is best? or is best something else?

CB> G16 si still a bit far from the corner, there are more threats on K16 - and it is very important to keep both white groups separate. But K15 si more dynamic than K17.]

(;B[fc]C[So I played F17 - thinking I'm protecting corner and same time attacking white stone.
still seems good to me.

CB> Approaching with a kosumi like this is bad shape. If you want to protect the corner and attack the white stone, you can play E17.]
;W[gc]C[white strengthen  its lone stone
now i was worried about my stone at K16

My thoughts are: I still want to seperate the two white groups, live between them, and I would like to try to cap the left group. Maybe too much to ask?

CB> Yes, you must give up something. There is not enough room to live between so you must be careful not to be surrounded - bu I think you can still separate white. To capture the left group seems ambitious, and maybe not pertinent: the real goal is just to threaten to do so while making territory.]

(;B[jc]C[Worried about K16 I strenghen it.];W[kb]C[White makes a base on the right side.
At the same time, attacks black stones. Made me nervous of white cap.
This moves also seems to aim at connecting with the left white stones under black's.
see variatons I considered. K17, C14,
in game I played J14

CB> You played K17 to separate white, didn't you? Well don't change your mind now, continue!]

(;B[if]C[I'm not sure this is a good move for me.
But, idea is to escape from K 16 stones,and same time envelope white G16.
If I play elsewhere, I was worried of white cap at K14

CB> The keima can still be cut later on. The tobi also, but it is more solid.]
;W[jb]C[
White is crawling below black,  connecting left and right

CB> Natural... it threaten to connect and give a better shape to white.]

(;B[ib]C[
I don't white to connect, so  I try to cut
But after game I don't think this is good.
White may connect, but is small. Why worry?
I think I should have played something else - see variations.

CB> It may be too slow to cut white now. Think this way : "if I play elsewhere, it will be too slow for white to come here and connect his stones, so I'm right on playing elsewhere." But, well, no, it's not a bad move, only an aggressive style.]
;W[ic]C[
This looks like good move for white. J18 looks very weak.

Key point of the game.

This was white Ko threat

White was aiming to obliterate entire black corner.

(;B[rl]C[
I think this was the biggest mistake of my game.
I didn't have to take the ko.

Final score W+90.5

Summary
---------------
In this game there were three 'snake fights' - top, left and right.
1) Top I got life but white was happy with influence.
2) Left I lost many stones and large area. Also, I had no threat to white, while in the other
two fights I also attacked a white snake.
3) On the right I managed to kill white invasion.

I think I could have avoided from the start getting into the troublesome fights
(1), (2), on the top and left. But how exactly?

Big decisive mistake was to ignore the ko threat to my bottom left corner.

I also seem to sufffer from occaisonal blindness, not seeing ataris.

CB> Yes, try to improve your reading. Practicing tsumegos is a good way of doing this.
CB> I hope my comments helped.
