C[ady1494: Hi!
Kasha: hello

Thx in advance for doing this review. I played this game in IGS but I don't know my rank in IGS but in KGS my rank is 19k, but that was thanks to me winning to a 17k thanks to luck and I'm playing black here.

TsuQ: Hi, I am TsuQ, my rating is now fluxuating from 4k-7k on KGS, I'll preface my comments with TsuQ: 

TsuQ: The time controls listed are a bit fast... If you didn't have enough time to think through your moves, it helps less when I comment on them.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op]C[TsuQ: This is a valid opening move, but usually one plays closer to the corner itself, this emphasizes the side (bottom). Q4 is quite common here.]
;W[dd];B[jo]LB[fc:B][pj:C][iq:A]C[TsuQ: This is too high. This move is trying to claim territory in the center, but the sides are still open. I've marked a few other moves that I think would be better.]
;W[dj];B[fo]C[TsuQ: Again this seems high, aiming for the center. It does put some pressure on the white corner, but white should want to take away the territory under your stones anyway...]

(;W[nc]C[TsuQ: I think white should have played F3.]
(;B[oc]C[TsuQ: This is best when you have supporting stones locally so you can profit from attacking the white stone.]
;W[le]C[TsuQ: This is odd. I've only ever seen O16 here for white.]

(;B[nb]C[I wasn't to sure about placing the stone here, cuz white then could have played a stone at around O13, but I guess I felt the need to secure my corner..

TsuQ: O13 should not be that much of a problem for you, you can continue to take territory on the fourth line. Closing off the corner completely is quite difficult when you play the 4-4.

You might see now that it's quite hard to make center territory... The stones on the bottom seem to not be doing as much as they should now. I prefer black to play O16 here in any case.]

(;W[nd]C[TsuQ: This is odd because it leaves the top open.]
;B[ne];W[gd];B[mc]C[I really put a stone here cuz I was afraid that white would gain even more territory at the top..

TsuQ: yes, this makes sure white will get less territory on top. M18 is also possible. The problem here is that white should keep most of the top if he responds, so it's important for you to spend a move to get yourself territory. White will have to use a move to block here later if he wants to keep you out. You need to move in the largest area on the side between two stones (Q10 area.)]
;W[md];B[lc];W[pj];B[qh]C[I really didn't know how to respond to white placing a stone at Q10 but I still felt the need to secure my corner..

TsuQ: It's unfortunate he played here first, but this seems a reasonable response.]
;W[cc]
(;B[ic]C[Now i realized that there's probably little chance for me gaining territory, should I have tried placing a stone at G13? or would that have been pointless?

TsuQ: G13 is perhaps a bit of an overplay... This isn't bad since it makes territory and forces white to defend to keep territory on the top, but the space between P4 and Q10 is greater.  I think a move around Q7 or Q8 could help you here.]
;W[jj]C[The threat is to make territory in the center. You can push from J17, or use the F5/K5 stone to support an invasion. It is also not impossible to attack on the side and try to gain compensation that way.]

(;B[mh]C[Now I really didn't know what to do, should I have put a stone a little further like around L12?

TsuQ: The important concept right here, is that Q10 is weak and the O16 stones are weak. Since this may be used to attack both of them, it's not bad, but consider the price of the response]
;W[kg]
(;B[mj]C[TsuQ: You make nothing by forcing white to make a base on the side, make him jump out while you get territory on the side. Also remember his connection between L13 and K10 isn't that strong, (and neither is K10 or L13) you may be able to use that also.]
;W[pn];B[po];W[qn];B[ql];W[ph];B[pg];W[oh]
(;B[ng]C[Was placing a stone here pointless?

TsuQ: You may be able to prevent those stones from connecting if you do that, but right now he has a few ways to try to live inside, so forcing him to connect might be more profitable.]
;W[qi];B[ol]C[I think here I placed the stone a bit to close, I think at that time I was aftraid of white connecting..

TsuQ: Seperating like this is a good idea if you are attacking both sides at once, but it looks like white is safe on the other side, so make sure you are selecting the best move to attack the other two stones... It may be better to close of the corner, and make them connect so you can take profit and play first elsewhere.]
;W[nk]
(;B[jl]C[TsuQ: Cutting off the O9 stone is not very important, your P8 stone is weaker than they are at the moment.]
;W[og];B[pf];W[of];B[oe];W[nf];B[mf];W[nh]
(;B[lg]C[TsuQ: I show another line here, since killing white in any case is quite hard, and can't really be attempted until playing something like R13.]
;W[mg]C[TsuQ: If white felt his group is in danger he should R13.]
;B[lh];W[qg];B[qf]C[I placed a stone here cuz, I could see that white's group of stones got strong but I still wanted to protect my corner..

TsuQ: This is the only reasonable response for you.];W[rg];B[rf]
;W[rh]
(;B[ng]C[TsuQ: This will not be an eye for white, this also doesn't connect you if you win it, so this is wrong. N15 is better locally.]
;W[nl]
(;B[ok]C[was this a stupid mistake? should i have played a stone at O7?

TsuQ: This looks bad since white can close you in where he is strong. I still like P6.]
;W[nj];B[if]C[Realized w had to much terrirtory so I tried to trap w stones and gain some territory...

TsuQ: Not too unreasonable, you can still P6 on the bottom here to gain in sente though, also realize your jump is a but weak because white has supporting stones on both sides should he try to cut.]
;W[jd];B[je];W[id]
(;B[kd]C[TsuQ: Watch out for your own thinness... L15 cuts better and supports K15 (and K15 supports it.)]
;W[jc]C[TsuQ: a bit passive...];B[ke];W[gg]
(;B[fi]C[Ok, to tell u the truth, I didn't know what I was trying to do with this stone..

TsuQ: It looks like you want to separate L10 here (at least that's my guess.)  I think the next big move must be somewhere around E3 though...]
;W[mp]C[W attacking me now, felt the need to both prevent it from connecting with the other stones and protect my corner..

TsuQ: This will be difficult for you now... you are so high on the side making territory may be hard... In order to help your corner, I think you need to attack the two white stones on the side first, then attack the single white stone, then white's corner stone.]

(;B[nq];W[jq]
(;B[gq];W[dm];B[fg];W[dg];B[gf];W[ff]
(;B[hg]C[TsuQ: other way];W[gh]
(;B[hi]C[was placing a stone here stupid of me? should i have connected my stones?

TsuQ: It looks like connecting your stones is better.];W[fh]
;B[gi];W[eg]
(;B[dq]C[tried to take this corner now..

TsuQ: A move in this corner is important, but it's also very important to play around F8 though to take advantage of the wall you just built. I don't know this invasion well... It seems that the 3x3 will work here as well. The other thing really important right now is that the N4 and K3 stones will be in some trouble if they're cut off, and if you do something to secure the stones around P8, you'll be better off.]
;W[ge]C[TsuQ: what? This is pointless, it tries to force F8 to keep your three stones safe..]
;B[kf]C[TsuQ: F8 instead... This looks unneeded.];W[ei];B[fj]
TR[fi][gi]C[In general empty triangle is bad. F8 is still ok.]
;W[gm];B[hl]C[placed a stone here to prevent w from possible connecting with K10..

TsuQ: This strengthens your position here, it's unfortunate you couldn't defend this hole earlier...]
;W[ep]
(;B[fp]C[TsuQ: Also consider E3 to keep some of the corner.]
;W[cq];B[lq]C[something i learned from someone popped into my head saying something about making this kind of frame, but do i u think I should have placed a stone at N6?

TsuQ: This is a smaller scale cut than something in the N6-O6 area, but it's more likely to succeed. P6 is still excellent as well.]
;W[lm];B[ll]C[didn't want w saving the stone at K10....

TsuQ: Reasonable.];W[om]C[Did not think these stones had a chance of surviving at all

TsuQ: well now that I've said it a few times I suppose you do =\]

TsuQ: Now that white is secure, protecting your corner becomes large locally.]
;B[fm]C[TsuQ: Also good.];W[lk];B[mk]C[TsuQ: I don't like this move even though it cuts the one stone, because it ends up being so thin...]
;W[ml];B[lj];W[kl];B[kk];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[jp];W[jm];B[ll]
C[TsuQ: In the position you ended up in, this seems the only reasonable move. That's pretty troublesome since if white were to fight this ko, you may end up having to give up a bit elsewhere... In general white's groups are more solid than yours.]
;W[km];B[il];W[qp];B[qo];W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[TsuQ:Check the option in the other line of S5...];W[rq]
C[Did not know what to do now..

TsuQ: S6, keeps separation, threatens trouble.]
(;B[pr];W[ro];B[nn]C[TsuQ: This cut threat seems to be too late since white can live on both sides, but this does seem to make S6 more of a threat.]
;W[oo];B[pp];W[no];B[np]C[TsuQ: I dont think this keeps the cut strong... better to N3 directly.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[mo];B[oj]C[TsuQ: It is too late for black here.]
;W[ni];B[pm];W[qk];B[on]
(;W[nm];B[rn]C[Though that I was pretty lucky with this move..but I don't know

TsuQ: Yes, white should give up the single stone I believe...]
;W[sp];B[qm];W[qr];B[or]C[Ok...I don't know what I was thinking

TsuQ: white has a reduction by playing P2, but many moves bigger at the moment.]
;W[pk];B[pl];W[rk];B[sr];W[sq];B[sn];W[so];B[rs]C[Hmm...should i have played a stone at R1? or is that corner already hopeless?

TsuQ: R1 will not work. This move is good in that it threatens to kill and has seki possibilities, but I think you should save it for later. It would also make a good ko threat.]
;W[qs];B[pq];W[eq];B[fr];W[rr];B[dr];W[cr];B[cs];W[en];B[bs]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[fl];B[hm];W[gl];B[ps]C[TsuQ: One point in strong sente... keep as a ko threat until near to the end, it's only a point gote for black.]
;W[ss];B[mn];W[mm]
(;B[ej]C[TsuQ: be aware the E11 stone may be expendable. I think this is strong enough at this time though...]
;W[dk]
(;B[lr]C[TsuQ: doesn't seem to be needed, G9 seems more important... Actually C4 is quite good as well.]
;W[aq];B[er];W[jk];B[hk];W[in]C[TsuQ: Things are difficult here... You must read and see if you can safely play H5.]
;B[hn];W[lk];B[kj];W[ek];B[ji]C[TsuQ: This isn't needed. The two stones are cut off, and it looks like all your stones can connect to one side or the other, even if white pushes at H12. Incidentally, if your worried about H12, just play it directly, it's at least a point better that way.]
;W[jb]
(;B[ld]C[I think by this time I was ready to end the game, felt like resigning cuz I knew that w  had already won thanks to that left side, i guess u can skip the other moves since they're really just me finalizing the territories..wasn't expecting the result though

TsuQ: I'll look though anyway...  oh and this should be at L18 (locally)]

Thought that I might have had lost by a ton! shows how big of an amateur i am..or is 93.5 to 87.0 a big difference?
