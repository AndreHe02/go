AB[pd][dp]C[Hello Michal,

my nickname on KGS is schwing. Currently I am german 1st kyu. I am reviewing this game. I will mark my comments with a leading 'TKI:'. Comments addressing to the subsequently introduced crucial part of the review will be marked with an additional asterix 'TKI*:'. I hope I can be of any help in your future go studies.

First of all, I very much like the idea of playing calm, which is a big part of my own style. Playing calm lets you focus on the territorial aspect of go and the wealth of your moves, which is a very important aspect. However, that should mean that you aren't too focused on the killing of opponents groups. That should not mean that you let live groups that DESERVE to be killed

* That is, a reason why you've lost the game lies in the false handling of your opponents weak groups. Thus, you need to practice the fighting part. I'm not talking about close combat, but overall board combat. (->1) Identify your own and your opponents weak groups and (->2) create an idea of how to 'activate' /use that weaknesses to get the next cupple of big points.
A weak group can be defined by the potential eyes (or eyespace) and the urgency in creating some. In terms of territorial points, think of a group without an eye that is a burden to your (or your opponents) play as of -20 points for the owner. If the group obtains an eye it can still be counted as -10 points, as the opponent gets to play multipurpose moves while attacking.
 
I'll discuss this part at some situations.

Best,
Thomas
P.S.: half a year is a good quote to acchieve single-diggit-kyu ranks - keep up the good work.

Hello, my name is Michal and I play for about half a year now. I'm 9k on KGS and this is a game from there. I'm white, so please review that and mistakes of black I didn't see.

It was a two stones handicap game. Recently I try to play solidly and calmly and I wonder if that was a good strategy here. Although I took three corners and diminished black's influence, so he didn't make any points in the center I still lost, and I don't know exactly why. Please point out my small moves or moves that help my opponent more than myself.

Thank you!];W[pq];B[dc];W[qf];B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd]
;W[ql]LB[jc:B][qj:A]C[I didn't know it was a joseki, so I went with a feeling and I played too far. At the same time my opponent played too close.

TKI: Don't stick with josekis too much. Yes, R8 is too far away from both, the top-right group and the bottom komuku to unify both. And yes, on the first sight N16 looks like bad shape. Try to think of the consequences this moves bring.

A fast an flexible play, such as yours, is mostly weak in connecting. Hence - even if not reasonable for now - b can (and should) aim for a splitting attack. 

On the other hand N16 is a pretty narrow (some might say "overconcentrated") move. And yet it defends against a potential cut at P16. Meanwhile the top edge remains more or less virgin territory.]
;B[md];W[de];B[gd]LB[fd:A]C[I didn't know this either, so I just played like black would play A.]
;W[cc];B[dd];W[cd];B[ch]
(;W[db]C[Is that a good way to use that weakness? Now I see that black can respond at E18 and I have no good followup (see variation). Any better moves?]
(;B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fq];B[hq]
(;W[cq]C[I wonder if my decision to jump to the corner was right. Black already has influence on the top, so giving him influence on the bottom would make it even stronger. What do you think? Would jumping out to F5 be better?

TKI: See variation nodes, but also consider that you could have played k3 in the first place.]
;B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[co]LB[co:B][fq:A]C[I knew B was a mistake with A stone in place and I've used it.

TKI: right];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[bo];W[do];B[eo]
;W[dn];B[en]
(;W[dl]C[I wasn't sure about this move. I know it is correct, I'm just not sure it's the best move in this situation.

TKI: You need to defend the three cutting stoned d5-d6-c6. If you 'd tennukied, black can escape with b5-c5 by turning at b6 or/and kill corner later.

TKI*: (->1) With the stone c12 in place, I would want to deprive the stone of the possibility for making a base with b8-c9.]
;B[ck]
(;W[cl]C[Know when I look I think I blocked from the wrong side. See variation - is that better?

TKI: No, yes or maybe - Difficult to answer. No, as the corner will die first - see my node. Yes, as the result after capturing c9 in a ponnuki is wearth a hell lot. Maybe, as I am not sure which result is best.]
;B[bk];W[bl];B[cf];W[ce];B[jc];W[df];B[dg];W[bf];B[cg]C[Often during a game, especially right after fuseki, I don't know what move to make (i.e. what is big), so I make those small exchanges. Is that aji keshi? Does that sequence help my opponent more than me? Were there bigger moves?

TKI: It was sente - at least from the point of view of your opponent - so you get the next big move anyways.

TKI*: (->1) This sequence is important considering the strength and weaknesses of groups. If you succeed in depriving this group of a base it is forced to run into the center (->2) whereas you calmly follow and get preperatory moves against a deep invation on the top.
Actually it is a bit early to actively start attacking this group but nonetheless the sequence was good and good timed as well.]
;W[kq];B[qo]C[I'm not sure I've handled that invasion well. It was close to the corner, so I was pretty sure I wouldn't be able to kill it. So instead I took points in the corner and side in sente. Was that decision good? Were there better moves to deal with that invasion?

TKI*: I think the invasion is too deep. (->1) There is no way that this stone gets a base on its own. (->2) You on the other hand have three gaps in your position due to overextended stones - at q3 to r8, q3 to l3 and r8 to q13. The idea would be to calmly defend these weakenesses while black is struggling to find two eyes.

You must not attach at r5 as r5 will become strong or easily saccrificed.]
(;W[oo];B[pn];W[qp]
(;B[om]TR[pi][pj]C[This seems strange. Myself I would just nobi at P6 and then attack R8 stone somewhere around the marked points (see variation). Does that make sense?

TKI: see variations];W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[pl];W[qk];B[pk];W[pj]
;B[og];W[ph];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp]
(;W[np]TR[gf][ni][fl]C[At this point I decided it's the last moment to enter the center, so I sacrificed the L3 stone to do that. I didn't like the other variations were L3 stones is saved. Was that a good decision? There are other gaps (marked) as well, but they seem pretty narrow to my 9k eye...

TKI: Saccrificing l3 is too big.

TKI*: (->2) As long as there are weak black groups around, the center will not become alot of territory. (->1) Note that with r7 the black group is floating without a base - without a single eye. But the proper timing is difficult to find here, because black can easily saccrifice s6 and just jump out. But this group is a part we will discuss later on.]

(;W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[dk];B[dj]C[Small exchange again, because I don't know what to do here.

TKI*: attack the base or the escape route of one of the weak groups]
(;W[nn]C[I've missed that move, I should have do that first. Otherwise, my N7 stones are in danger and black could finally use his influence to gain a lot of points.]
;B[mk];W[gf]C[Time to diminish black's influence. Is that the right point to do that? Should I approach from a different side? Deeper? How should I decide?

TKI*: (->2) look for multipurpose. This move also cuts left side from the top. You need to carefully read whether or not the left side is alive as it stands.]
;B[ie];W[he];B[hd]SQ[he]C[TKI: bad trade];W[if];B[je];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[ni]C[Again, the same questions: Is that a good direction? Is that too close?

TKI*: Again, the same answer. Right side is not fully alive either. So a cut is important. N11 looks better but needs to be carefully read out.]

TKI*: You should now come to another conclusion. If you get g10, the right and the left side group need to live on their own. Even in the endgame you can play with strong and weak groups. For example, black needs to saccrifice the s6-stone.]

And the stones on the left side are working together (A). A move around P13 creates a huge moyo (E). black will not be able to get all big points or even to defend at all the urgent points. 

TKI*: (->2) So, identifying the urgent points now is most important. I think C and D are most important as the life and death of groups is involved. Splitting at C results in a running fight and might make the lower left corner vulnerable. Splitting at D weakens the top left corner.]
