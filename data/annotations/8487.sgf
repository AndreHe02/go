AB[pd][dp]C[Hi reviewer. This game was very close -- white won by 4.5 points. I think my biggest mistakes were

allowing white to make a base on the top  and subsequently reduce the top right
and
playing hane instead of extension on move 84

This is a good forcing move: white M17 is weaker becouse escaping in the middle is more difficult now.

No, in the endgame you should play all the sente moves you have.

1) double sente (sente for both players)
2) sente (sente only for you) 
3) reverse sente (gote for you, sente for the opponent)

Norman314 [11k\]: That made the difference
gmaster [9k\]: also helps support kgs if you want to help them a little
Norman314 [11k\]: got it

****
1) Beginning: It's the most difficult part of the game. The direction of game is very important, even though it isn't simple to see. You left your D4 stone alone, surrounded by two strong white groups (taht allows white to make lots of territory in the centre).
The stones on hoshi need to extend on one side.

2) Middlegame: You played well on the right side, but you didn't attack white weak group in the upper side (maybe that could have helped you to develope in the centre). 
Forcing move: a real forcing move doesn't need to be rescued, it could probably become useful later.

3) Endgame: no big mistakes, only some unnecessary move.
Remember this:
 1) double sente (sente for both players)
 2) sente 
 3) reverse sente (gote for you, sente for the opponent)
 4) gote (gote for both players)
