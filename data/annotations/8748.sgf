Hi reviewer!

I am interested particularly in my opening and endgame, as well as bigger mistakes made. I have left questions at moves of special interest.

Thanks in advance for reviewing my game!


Yi Sheng];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[cm]
(;B[cq]C[j:  I would delay the 3-3 invasion.  Grabbing a little corner territory seems inconsistent with the first two moves]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[co]
(;B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo];W[bn]C[I later learned about a better variation, which I show at move 10. Is there any other way in this situation?                                                                 J: See comments in the variation]
;B[bp]
(;W[dn];B[eo];W[do];B[jq]TR[jp]C[Is there a better place for this move?                                                                 J:  One row higher might fit a little better with your first two stones but 21 is not bad IMO]
(;W[fp]
(;B[gp]C[J:  I think better to leave this area. White is strong. Puttingstones against this strength leaves them weak.]
;W[fo];B[fc];W[hc]
(;B[cc]C[Was it a mistake to jump in and let W create a big moyo on the left?                                                                             J: Yes, white's reply is instinctive and good.  Alternatives to stop the left building up would be better.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge];B[pj]TR[gj][hj][gk]C[J: I don't think black can wait too long before doing something about the white moyo on the left.  The marked positions do a little to flatten the left side and work a little to give black a moyo with 33 at a later stage]
;W[ef]C[J:  White gave you a free move :)]
(;B[kc]TR[fb][jc]C[Is this too near the W wall?                                                                                 Its either not near enough to too near :)  The idea of the marked stone is to allow options for attacking on the top.]
;W[jc]TR[nc][pc][qf][qn][qp][nq]C[J:  This is a bad move by white.  All the marked positions would have been better IMO.  The black stones on the top and the bottom are not secure so a standard approach play has the possibility of isolating them.                                                                               Invading and reducing the black moyo while there are opportunities also makes a big difference]
(;B[kd];W[qc];B[qd]C[Was there a better way to respond here? In the usual joseki(which was played), B is overconcentrated I think.                                                                J:  This was the correct side to block.  If there is a problem it is with the previous stone.]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]
(;B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[qn]
(;B[np]C[Should I be attacking this stone more aggressively here?                                J: The alternative does more to make the white stone run to safety. The game lets white settle too easily]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[qk];B[pl];W[ql];B[pn];W[pm];B[om];W[qm];B[ol]
;W[po];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[pn]C[Is there a better sequence here than what was played(starting from move 55)?                                                             J: White should not have played 66, it gives black sente to build his moyo.   The idea of the sequence is OK. White was always going to live on the side so the moyo was a good idea]
;B[hf];W[he];B[if];W[gf]
(;B[id]C[J: Too small.  Black's strategy was to build a moyo, why switch to a local attack?]

How could I have played the endgame better?
Thanks again for the review! You are much appreciated.                                                                                               Review by Jadoube 5k                                                                                                                                                 Both players tend towards a defensive style. This game had more opportunities for aggression and fighting. I assume the game was a fast one - both players make a number of extraordinary small moves at times throughout the game. Simply eliminating these would lead to a big improvement.                                                                                                                                      More often it is black who finds occasion to consider the wider board. Develop this habit, it will help a lot  :)                                                                                                   Try to build up a wider range of joseki - and think about the consequences of alternatives rather than one out of habit.   The end game requires counting, concentration, and attention to detail. The odd point here and there may add up to a big difference at the end of the game.                                                                                                          Overall there is a good foundation. Enjoy building on it :)]
