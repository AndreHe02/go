C[Hi

I (Batavia) Played black in this game on kgs and i hoping to get some comments

The biggest problem i seem to be having is when do i give up on fighting and when would this be too advantagious to my opponent. any insignts you could have would be appreciated

Thanks In advance

VictorPelt

MKG: Hi hi ^_^ I try to help and answer your question, my comments will have "MKG" in front of them to help you.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[pp];B[co];W[cp]TR[cj][dj][ck][dk]C[MKG: This White move is a bit odd here, as it helps black get strong.  Black gains more out of this exchange.  This move is usually played one there is a white stone around C10. To cramp black up, but this here helps black.]
;B[do];W[fp];B[dk]C[is this joseki(or just could for black)
i couldn't find the D3/C4 joseki
it seems that white after F5 has both a large corner and develops the side nicely
but i can't find a  better play for black

MKG: Please look at the comments at start of this sequence!

MKG: But if you look black gains more in my thinking! And your stones are more expanded out.  Where as white's are all crampped down usually not good so earily in game. Look at the veration for better line of play for white.]
;W[df]
(;B[ch]C[MKG: This is wrong idea, know why?

Reasons 
1) It's doubling on the effort with D9 already there white can't do much there, there isn't much potential there.

2) You are not using Q16 with this it only uses D16 to a point, think what would heppen if black plays E16 to anser this, now Q16 is alone and can later come under attack.  Look at the other possible line of play.]

(;B[le]C[I wasn't quite sure how to deal with K17
should I have played H17 instead (this would have secured more terretory butwould have made things easy forwhite after K15

MKG: You should attack F15 first. Look at the other path.];W[gc]
;B[gd];W[fc];B[ec];W[iq]
(;B[oc]C[I wanted to put some presure on white's group, but i allowed him to connect. would Q17 be better?
also, are the M17/15 stones too weak  or do they still have a shot

MKG: Problem here is I think u are thinking that white is stronger when it's other way around black is stronger! You have to attack.]

;B[qj]C[don'tknowwhy i tried this, probally because i wasn't counting liberties originally i played R9 with the intention of playing R7 and then deffencing and allowing white to live small]
;W[rj];B[pm];W[qm];B[nm];W[ji]C[can (or should) I save my black group
problam i'm always having is that i don't think i can let my group die because it's too big, but i can't affor to strengthen white too much by trying t save it

MKG: Rule of thumb, 1 stone = light, 2 stones = heavy.  When It's this open u shouldn't be scared ... help ur stones.]

(;B[ki]C[again thank you move];W[kj];B[jj]C[now the black stones are dead (almost)

are these variations reasonable? or is there something
white could have dont that i'm missing

lets take a count ...

White: BR: (10 MAYBE) BL: 20 TC: 32 R: 7 Captures: 3, Total: 72 ish (plus komi) :(

lets look at power ...

Black: 2 weak group! (J9) and (M13)
White: 1 weak group! (D14)

You are AHEAD! so don't need to be greedy with plays like M8, just play safe! The note here is to consider white's bottom isn't much for space yet! it's reducable!]

Lessons from game 

1) Don't attack what u attack
2) When heat of battle dies down take a count ...
3) If ahead reduce.
4) Don't count ur groups out quickly find a way to fight where u are strong.
