Hello!
I lost this game by a a lot of points.. I've reviewed it and I will annotate what I see that I can improve.. Please help me out  improving my review! :)


B: hi, I'm Bart, around 7 kyu, and I'll try to help you out. My comments will start with B:.]
;W[pp];B[cf];W[gq];B[cn];W[jp];B[qf]LB[jd:A][pj:B]C[B: this is ok, although playing around A or B is also possible. A makes it harder for white to invade later.]
;W[cj]LB[jd:A]C[B: not the best point for white to invade in my opinion. You can still play around A.]
;B[qn]C[B: good to play elsewhere and not follow white.];W[on]
;B[rp];W[qq]
(;B[qk]C[Maybe Q8?

B: yes, possible too. But R9 is not wrong.];W[nc];B[oc]LB[kc:A]
C[I think Q17 or Q18 is the right thing to do...

B: well, you are already pretty strong on the right side, so it's ok to play close like this. Another option is A. Maybe white will run to the center or try to live in the corner, but it will be small and you can develop the left side.]
;W[nd];B[jc]C[K16? E17?

B: I think this is ok. White will have to live small with M17, or run to the center. And you can develop the left side.]
;W[fc]C[B: ok, so white doesn't play M17 or L16 but another invading stone...]

(;B[ec]C[May this be ok now because of K17?

B: ...so I think it would be better to play on the other side. See variations.]
;W[fd]
(;B[ef]LB[jc:B][ef:A]TR[fc][nc][fd][nd]C[B: this is good for attacking the white stone A, but now your own stone B is very lonely between the white triangled stones.]
;W[je]C[B: and white plays where you want to play (see the difference if your stone is there instead).]
;B[hd]C[B: good to go in that direction.];W[he]C[Please help me reviewing this fight.. :)

B: ok. It is a difficult fight because white is stronger that your two stones.]
;B[ge];W[gd]
(;B[ie]C[B: not bad, you do not have many options here, see variations.]
;W[hf];B[id];W[fe];B[gf];W[ff];B[gg];W[fg];B[gh];W[if];B[ke]

(;W[jf]C[B: I think this is too slow for white...];B[lc];W[jd]
;B[kd];W[kf];B[lf];W[lg];B[mf]C[B: ..so you get a pretty good shape.]
;W[nf];B[mg]C[B: good. O14 was not a good idea by white, I think.]
;W[ng];B[mh];W[kg];B[ki]LB[jf:A]C[B: do you wanrt to capture group A? ...]
;W[ji]
(;B[li]C[B: ... if so, better to keep white from running out, e.g. K12.]
;W[jh];B[nh]CR[fi][gj]LB[gg:A]C[B: ok, but beware that your A group is almost surrounded. A play at G10 or F11 is probably better.]
;W[eg];B[cg]C[Is this move ok?

B: good to keep white from getting a base on the left, but... E15 is waiting for white to play next.]
;W[ee]
(;B[df]C[B: Have you considered D15? See variation.];W[de];B[ce]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[bd];B[bc];W[dg];B[ch];W[di];B[gj]C[B: what if white plays G11? Hard to get away with that group.]

(;W[en]CR[jk][dl][dm][jm][fp]TR[ge][gf][gg][gh][gj]C[B: white is trying to surround your group in a big circle.]
;B[dq];W[jj];B[dl]C[B: and I think you see it too, but it's a big jump to connect there.]
;W[fk];B[gk];W[fl]
(;B[jl];W[ik];B[il]LB[gk:A][jl:B]C[G8 instead?

B: no, it's as on the left side: the jump form A to B is a bit too far.
Problem is, a closer jump is not  fast enough to get out.];W[hl]

;B[dj];W[dh];B[ci];W[ck];B[ih];W[kj]
(;B[fb]C[Too late.. When do I have to Do This or G18?

B: yes, earlier on it was already too late.
Maybe even H18.];W[gb];B[eb];W[hb];B[hc];W[gc];B[ic];W[ib];B[jb]
;W[hi];B[fh];W[gi];B[ei];W[fi];B[ia];W[eh];B[rq]CR[mk][nl]LB[jl:A]
C[B: beware of your group A. White can try to surround it as he did with your other group before.
If you spot it in time, you can still run (e.g. M8 or maybe N8)
This is more urgent than playing S3.];W[rr];B[ph]C[M10..

B: M8.];W[lj];B[mj];W[mk]LB[jl:A]C[B: now you help white surround your group A.]
;B[pr]C[B: better to keep this for later];W[qr];B[jr]LB[dq:A]
[pr:B]C[Unnecessary? O8?

B: well, it is hard to do something with that stone. A and B are too far awaty and the white stones are pretty good connected. F2 is big endgame. And N7 is maybe (difficult!) possible to get your group out. O8 is indeed a nice point to get into the white territory.]

;W[nj];B[pi];W[mi];B[nm]C[B: this doesn't work. Better to play a big move.]
;W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[io]C[B: now you add a stone to a dead group. Better to play a big move.]
;W[om];B[im];W[hn];B[ll];W[ml];B[jn]C[B: nice! M8 was good to prevent white from making your eye false. Then I take my words back; you do have a live group :-)]

;W[an];B[bk];W[bj];B[am];W[el];B[ao]C[B: this is a lot harder ko to fight.]

;W[pc];B[od];W[ob]C[B: white lives in the corner.. so wins on points. But before the mistakes in the bottom left you played a good game and were ahead after getting your lower group alive.]

B: it only went wrong near the end. There where some choices along that would have avoided some problems. Try to see if you have a weak group your opponent is after. That will help you getting into trouble later on.
But I think you played a pretty good game, the disaster was only near the end.]
