C[Hello,

Please review for White.

I'm looking forward to learning from your comments :)

Thanks!
Martin (Tictoc)



Hello, I'm Tilwen, I'll put a T before my comments.
It seems to me that you missed a bit of tempo in the lower left corner and fell a bit behind, but then Black missed winning spirit and let you make a moyo and enough points to come back.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[cf];W[ep];B[gq]C[T : you ended the sequence with some strength, but you ended gote and white could take C10, then the result isn't good (white has no target to attack). I have to say I thought you played correctly the joseki, but truth is you played the wrong order of moves.]
;W[cq]C[Note : if you want to fight, you can try E2 instead.]
;B[dq];W[dp];B[eq];W[fq];B[fp];W[fr];B[cr];W[bq];B[er]
(;W[fo]C[T : Here is the mistake. When you play atari here, you must then connect with C5 (as you did), but this threats nothing for black (except a bit of yose at B2). Correct order is C5 first (see variation).]
;B[gp];W[co];B[cj]C[T : now your lower left seems a bit useless, and black could aim at attacking D16.]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[np];B[lq]C[T : this is not joseki at all, Black should keep pressure with Q6, O5, even R3 could work maybe.]
;W[qq];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[rn]C[T : you play safe, Black has a big defect in his position now, and O4 could have aji for later.]
;B[nn];W[pr]C[T : I feel like this hane is a bad idea, it'll make black stronger and the cut around Q7 could be not interesting anymore. I think you should let it asit stands and take sente to play an other area, upper side is widely open.]
;B[or];W[qr];B[ln];W[nr]C[T : this is only yose.];B[nq];W[os]
;B[oq];W[mr]C[T : black can tenuki here, there are very big areas left.]
;B[lr];W[en]C[T : this feels very small to me : your group is alive because B2 is sente. Black was nice with you when he answered :) . You're making your group stronger, but there is no target to attack.]
;B[hn];W[jd];B[qf];W[pi]C[T : this is too ambitious, you can't try to make a moyo because black C14/C10 is strong (white didn't defend around F17) and O6/M6/H6 are very high. Moreover, black can link more or less to R8. Black can jump (see variation).
The point is, your san-ren-sei will be hard to use here for the reasons I just told (black doesn't have weak groups and has high stones).]
(;B[ri];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[pf]
(;B[qc]C[T : black's shape is quite bad here, you did well to take advantage of it.]
;W[pc];B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[rf];B[pb];W[ob];B[rd]C[T : as black I would play R18, I think it's sente (P17 cut could hurt).]
;W[ch]C[T : this is probably an overplay, black is ahead he can play simple. But you need to try stuff to get back :) .]
;B[ef];W[fd];B[di];W[cd]C[T : I'm not sure this is sente. As Black i guess I would play R18 in sente, then aim at H16/H17 or N11 to reduce white.]
;B[dh];W[jh];B[hc];W[fc];B[jb]
(;W[ic]C[T : I think this isn't good shape (you played the same at R12), I would try L17 (see variation).]
;B[ib];W[hd];B[jc];W[id];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[md];B[gc];W[gd]
;B[fb];W[eb];B[gb];W[br];B[gr];W[cl]C[T : you probably should your moyo stronger here (with P9, aiming at the cut maybe, or K/L10 ?), C8 isn't that big (see variation).]
(;B[ck];W[jj];B[mj];W[mi];B[li]
(;W[lj]C[T : maybe N12 is enough ? (see variation)];B[ni];W[mh]
;B[lk];W[kj];B[nh];W[nj];B[oj];W[mk];B[oi];W[ng];B[pj];W[gg]
;B[gi]C[T : Black plays in dame here. B8, R18 or K7 seems bigger.]
;W[hh];B[bl];W[cm];B[bm];W[bn];B[qb];W[nc];B[hl]C[T : once again, Black defends not effectively. You did well denying his moves.]
;W[jm];B[jn];W[im];B[in];W[hm];B[gm];W[km];B[lm];W[ll];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[ik];W[jl];B[el]C[T : E8 H8 and G11 make few points in gote, white made some points around M9.]
;W[hj];B[hi];W[ij];B[gj];W[hk];B[gk];W[il];B[gf];W[hf];B[fg]
(;W[bf]C[T : because of D12 this doesn't work, B15 is just fne and sente.]

(;B[of];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[ri]C[T : this can be joseki usually to reduce a potentially big moyo. Now white Q11 is weak, and D16 needs defend, so black can easily reduce the upper side.]

(;W[co]C[T : Black now can't afford to let you play G2 and threat to capture the E3 stones, then he defends with G2 for instance.]

;B[gp]C[T : White doesn't end that much strong in this joseki (because of the cut at E5 for instance), but you have sente and can go on attack, with C12 maybe.]
