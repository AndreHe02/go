C[MK: Hello, my name's Michal Kwiatkowski and I'll review your game. My comments will be prefixed with "MK:".]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dq];W[dc];B[qn];W[nq];B[pk]
(;W[kp]C[VipassanaMan: Too close? Not big enough at this stage?

MK: I would tenuki at this point and either approach or finish a corner (see variations), as there's no immediate threat to the righ-bottom corner stones. Since Q9 is high, white can later invade at R11 or R14.]
;B[co];W[ce];B[jc];W[qf]
(;B[qh]
(;W[of]C[VipassanaMan: R16 or 3-3 R17 better? Maybe R14 is the problem - but felt I had to approach this corner but then ended up getting squeezed....

MK: R14 was OK and with that you should expect a pincer. Jumping to san-san after that would be better (see variations).]
;B[nd];W[pi];B[qi];W[pj];B[qj];W[ph]
(;B[rp]C[MK: Black is being nice, nullifying white's wall would be much more fun (see variation). Because of black stone at Q9 you can't just play joseki as nothing happened.]

(;W[qg]C[VipassanaMan: Too small I think

MK: Not necessarly, with black Q9 the cut can become problematic, although here I would go with P9 (see variation).]
;B[rd];W[ok];B[pl];W[lh]TR[hc][je][cj][dj][nj]C[VipassanaMan: I was trying to use the influence of my wall here but honestly I've very little idea how to do that exactly...

MK: You usually want to play far from your strenght. You can use a wall either to help your invasion or hinder enemy's invasion. If you're unsure of your group's strenght, a move like O10 would fix your shape better. But now white could just take a big point at C10, D10, or consider moves like K15 or H17.]
;B[cj]C[MK: Instead, black took a big point.];W[ch]C[VipassanaMan: Think something around G3 or H4 was bigger?

MK: This one is also good, as white has a nice followup at C8 later.]
;B[ip];W[hc];B[je];W[jh]TR[cl][gp]C[MK: What does this move accomplish? It doesn't secure territory nor attack a weak group. Influence gained is not much either. If you look closely at the bottom-left you'll notice black is making a nice framework, so now it would be a good time to reduce it (see marked points).]
;B[ej]C[MK: Black solidifies its framework, making it harder for white to invade.]
;W[gj]TR[fk][gl][gm][hn][ho]C[VipassanaMan: Not sure what I was trying to achieve with this...

MK: Depending on how you're doing in the rest of the board you may always consider an invasion or a reduction. If you want to reduce, move at G10 is too far from black's border. Moves at marked spots would be better.]
;B[gk];W[hk];B[gl];W[hj]C[MK: Black gained some points, but white as well (in the center). Still, considering the alternative (see previous comments), white could do better.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[hd];W[fd];B[fe];W[ed];B[in]
(;W[hp]C[VipassanaMan: So my counting skills aren't great but I think I was pretty sure I was already badly behind and had to reduce his corner, hence this attack.

MK: Touching a stone like this will only make it stronger. Since D3+C5 are also very strong you're basically placing your invasion between two strong groups. Considering available space it doesn't have much hope of surviving. The main problem is that this invasion is too late. You best hope at this moment is to try moves like J3 (see variation) that somehow utilize your L4 stone that is near.]
;B[iq];W[gp];B[gr];W[ep];B[fn]C[MK: In order to survive you need space to form two eyes. Here it is very clear there is no space for white to form two eyes. It's best to imagine where your group can get eyes *before* the invasion, so that you can choose the best option.]
;W[cm]C[MK: This stone has no way to connect to a living group nor a way to form two eyes itself. It is -1 point and gote.]
;B[dn]C[MK: Black was winning, so he can play safe.];W[cn];B[do]

C[VipassanaMan: But as often happens my attack left him space to destroy my own centre :(

MK: Yes, you've pushed black toward the center a little bit, although a stone at J6 was there even before your invasion, so it wasn't by no means "your centre". ;)]

MK: No, there was no way for white to live here, so this black move was unnecessary.]

VipassanaMan: So I lost this game very early on it seems to me - which is always where i lose to stronger players it seems - I didn't make any big life or death errors that I can see - I don't think my attack ever had a chance at succeeding, not the way I tried it anyway! Invading solid corners I find to be almost impossible right now at least....

MK: After 45 black had a lot of points in the lower bottom. It's best to try and anticipate such developments and invade before they happen - it's much easier to live or run when there is still a lot of empty space.]
