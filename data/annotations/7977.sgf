OT[5x30 byo-yomi]
RU[Japanese]

C[Hagios: This was a fun game, I never felt particularly pressured in, but I ended up winning by only 5.5p (due to scoring error--should have been 4.5p).  If this were an even game, that would be a 2.5p loss.  I want to find some good ways to improve my game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq]LB[cn:1][lq:2]C[H: This is my favorite opening lately]
;W[ip]C[H: This spoils it, of course.  With this j4, It seems best to jump out for me, making large-scale use of r4.

reid: yes :-) Your opponents job is to make your life miserable.

I think it is best to not get too attached to any particular fuseki, or even style (such as moyo vs. territory).  Instead, keep your mind open to the flow of the game and play the move that best fits the current situation.  That way, you don't get frustrated or confused just because your opponent didn't follow your plan.  And you might be able to frustrate him instead!]
;B[fo];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir];W[op]LB[nc:A][de:B][qj:C]C[H: Now I'm feeling good.  I don't see a way that this can be a bad result for Black.

reid: Yes.  The lower left corner is joseki, of course.  But white should not feel the need to invade right away.  His J4 stone by itself functions to keep black's moyo under control (D2 and J2 are on the second line, and so are not big moyo moves).  A, B, or somewhere around C look like better choices for white.]
;B[oq];W[pp]LB[nq:A]C[reid: Of course, white cannot play the josekis starting with A.  They will not get a good result due to the J2 stone.  But the avalanche joseki is for building thickness along the right side.  Also not so good since black is at Q16.  P4 was too early.]
;B[pq];W[qo];B[np]LB[qf:F][ql:E][qn:C][rn:D][ro:B][nq:G][qq:A]
C[reid: This looks to me like black is trying to attack the J4 stone.  But it is very difficult to actually capture it.  I would prefer to simply connect at A (R3) and take good corner profit while white struggles to catch up.

The continuation would be Black A, white O4, black B through white E.  Then black stays ahead on territory while negating the white thickness with F.  White's outside thickness is not useful.  White G is not sente, so black is not worried about white territory on the bottom side.]
;W[qq];B[rp];W[qr];B[ro];W[pn];B[qn];W[nq];B[po];W[oo];B[on]
;W[no];B[pm];W[mp]C[reid: This is joseki, but it feels to me like white settled just a little too easily.]
;B[nd]LB[qf:A]C[H: To this point, I feel ahead.

reid: Yes, I think black is ahead before O16 (we can't compare after O16 because black has an extra stone on the board).  However, I think O16 is asking for too much.  The right hand area is too big and too easy to invade.

If we remove Q16 and ask how far should black extent from Q7, the R13 spot looks about right.  But since Q16 is there, and the corner is also a big consideration, I think black should play at A (instead of N16 or R13).  It is much more difficult for white to invade the right side.  It is starting to look like real territory.]
;W[jc];B[ce]LB[cf:B][df:A][ci:C]C[H: This is what I feel was the first major mistake.  I should have approached further away.

reid: Further away is possible, either A/B, or C.  But C15 looks OK too.  If K17 were closer, or high instead of low, C15 would be more doubtful.]
;W[dh]C[reid: This is sort of a moyo-like move for white.  But this is not a good place for white to build a moyo (black F5).]
;B[ed]C[H: I played this, hoping to keep W low and find some attacking chances vs d12 and c6.  I am unhappy with this result.  I guess c15 was the main problem?  How should I have played instead of e16, after that mistake?

reid: I think the result here for black was OK.  Perhaps white should have tried something a little different?  See next move.]
;W[ec]LB[dd:A][de:B][ee:C]C[reid: White is a little behind, and this joseki is not really going to do good things for white.  Instead, perhaps white should try the more complicated push and cut (white A, black B, white C).  White has a numerical superiority of stones in this area, so the fighting should be good for him.]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[hc]LB[gb:B][gc:A][ic:D][hd:C]C[H: I considered punching through immediately, followed by h16.  I wasn't sure if this was a vulgar line, though.

reid: Hmm, "vulgar"?  That's a term the japanese senseis  used to use.  But if there is one thing we have learned in the last 25 years from the Korean and Chinese players, it is that "pretty" and "vulgar" don't hold a candle to "works" and "doesn't work".

If black pushes at G17 right away, white blocks at G18, black pushes the other way with H16 and white has no choice but to connect submissively at D (J17).  This makes white K17 look a little silly, so this is good, right?

Wrong!  By exchanging the push at G17 for white G18, black takes away one of his own liberties (and uses up a potential ko threat)!  That risks putting this line into the category of "doesn't work".

Instead of A (G17), black should simply push at C (H16) directly.  White still has to answer at D, but black doesn't lose the liberty.]
;B[dj]LB[fh:A]C[reid: OK, this looks like a problem to me.  The E16 stones are outnumbered and have no eyes yet.  Black tries to attack D12, presumably to get life for the E16 group, but now he has another group to look out for!  White should be able to get a splitting attack going here.  White A could be quite troublesome for black.]
;W[hd]C[H: I didn't see this.  This suggests that the vulgar line starting at g15 was the right way to go.

reid: This is reverse sente for white, and so fairly important, but the really critical thing is for white to get that splitting attack going. True, he might have to submit to black H16 with J17, but after that one exchange, black runs out of sente moves to help him save the stones.  He has to start doing some heavy lifting (non-sente moves feel like such a struggle to play).]
;B[fg]LB[gf:B][ch:D][eh:C][fh:A]C[reid: This move looks a little funny too.  A black cap at A is one possibility.  Another is to make shape with B.  But this move seems half-way in between.  It doesn't really attack the white stone effectively, and it has some bad connection aji.

I think my own preference would be to start a fight and try to settle the black stones.  An attachment over or under (C or D) would provoke something.  Black can afford to lose a stone or two here if he can settle quickly.]
;W[fh];B[eg]LB[ff:K][gg:I][hg:J][gh:A][fi:B][dm:C][em:E][fm:H]
[dn:D][en:F][fn:G]C[reid: This feels heavy to me.  The relationship between these two stones and the E16 stones is too confined.

Black A, white B, to black E might be interesting, but possibly dangerous.  There are some cuts that black has to worry about (H and I), but white has to worry about his F12 stones too.  Black can afford to give up a few stones if he can attack F12 effectively.

Black could also jump to J.  White will probably play at E13, black responds at K.]
;W[eh];B[cr]LB[hg:A]C[H: Preparing for c8, but probably a bad move.

reid: Things are a little hot around E12 right now, probably not a good time to leave that area.

Perhaps black A to keep center access?];W[gg]C[reid: Ouch.]
;B[gf];W[hf];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[ff];B[bg];W[ci];B[bh];W[ge]
LB[cf:B][df:A][ef:C]C[reid: White should first squeeze with A, black B, white C, black connects, then take at G15.]
;B[di];W[el];B[gh];W[gi];B[hh];W[fi];B[hi];W[gk];B[cl];W[dl]
;B[ck];W[hj];B[mc]LB[qe:A]C[H: I'm happy to give up 3 stones and make cash.

reid: Yes, they are not doing much strategically.  Just be careful that they are not captured on a large scale.

I think A would be bigger than N17.];W[qf];B[re]LB[qe:A][mf:E]
[nf:D][pf:B][pi:C]C[reid: The standard kick might get a better result than the game:  black A, white B black C, white jumps to D, then black attaches at E and tries to do something with the center three stones assisting.  White will have a hard time capturing the three while his own group is unstable.]
;W[rf];B[qe];W[of]LB[pf:A]C[reid: the jump feels natural, but it leaves bad aji.  Better to extend with A]
;B[qi]LB[pi:A]C[H: What's best here?  I felt bad making territory with thickness, and worse after W caps.

reid:  Right now, black is ahead on territory.  What might upset that is if white captures the center stones in a big way.

Playing at A would do more to help your center stones while still limiting white's extension (he would have to slide under on the second line which means very little territory for him).  A also makes a cap more difficult (and a smaller center for white).]
;W[oi];B[pj];W[nk]C[reid: white encloses a big center.

There are a lot more moves in this game, but the main points have all been decided.  

Black established a slight lead early on and held on to it for the whole game.  White almost upset the game with this large center capture.  Black could have attacked the white P14 stones a bit more (instead of taking territory).  That would have been a more sure path to victory.  The main lesson from that particular decision is that when you are ahead in territory, you usually don't want to take more territory.  Instead, try to maintain the balance of power and play steadily to prevent upsets.

Earlier, black D10 made the game more difficult for him (potentially two weak groups to take care of), but white didn't exploit the mistake and black settled by joining up and taking some territory.

Overall, a good game.
