(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[Reviewed by Andac 4k*.

You Andrew asked some specific questions. I try to summarize the answers
here in short. Then please browse through this small review.

"My main questions are on how can I open better.  My opening feels like i
am scrambling to keep black from influencing too much."

When you play white, it always feels that black gets a bit too much
influence.  The most important thing is to keep up with the pace. When
blacks builds, build you too. You get the komi to compensate for the
black's advantage which is often most imminent in the beginning. If you
panic and attack too early, you will lose. Play carefully but calmly.
Eventually black will make a mistake that you can utilize to get control
of the game.

Try also to figure out what formations are stronger and which ones are
weaker. Then play according to the rule "play near weak positions", both
strengthening your own and attacking the opponents, and try to force the
opponent to play against that rule, approaching your strong positions.
This will give you advantage. There is a good example near the beginning,
see the comments there.

"What key points did I miss during the game that caused black to apply a
lot of pressure with success?"

These are found from the review too, but in short: (1) You could have
attacked the D16 corner but failed, instead creating a weak group of your
own. (2) Your attack against black's invasion near K16 failed because you
tenukied at the critical moment. (3) You were already severely behind
then, but the black's suidical invasion near N3 was improperly handled,
causing you to lose many points.

"How could I have attacked the two large black frame works that
developed?"

Not effectively. The problem surfaces earlier: you played in a way that
made the frameworks too strong to be subject to an effective attack.

"Any comments on my general style of lack there of?"

I got the feeling that you played a bit passive and submissive moves.
Don't be frightened of the opponent, or you will miss many key moves and
opportunities. Also, it is possible that you could improve your playing a
lot by trying to get a better feeling of "good shape". One good way is to
observe good players' games. You don't need to understand the games fully,
just try to look what kind of formations the good players prefer. You will
start appreciating them too, especially when you play them in your own
games and see how they work.

"Any comments on what black did through out that I could have took
advantage of, learn from etc.?"

Well, black messed up with the upper left corner and lost the game because
of that. Otherwise I think black held the upper hand. No specific here, I
think that the game is best understood from the point of your mistakes
that gave black advantage.

Last few words: I'm a weak go player and have surely made blunders in this
review, sorry for those. And, don't be afraid to meet your own mistakes,
when you understand that they are mistakes and look at them for a while
you won't do them so easily again.

That being said... let the game begin.]GN[TheOnyx-salvor7.sgf]PB[TheOnyx]

US[Zone];B[cp];W[pc];B[dd];W[qp];B[eq];W[oq]C[I don't think white can play here.
If next black extends from LL shimari and white from the LR shimari,
black plays K4 and gets a "double-wing" formation.
By playing here, white makes K4 a very big point that both
players would like to play. Because black plays next black
gets the advantage.];B[di]TR[ci]C[Black extends from the shimari as expected.
Big move, although I would have played perhaps
one line lower (marked). This would form a better
shape with the UL corner stone. D10 and C10 are
also alternatives.];W[fc];B[pi]TR[qf]C[In this position, white must attack from above,
e.g. by making wide shimari at R14 (marked).
Other moves are also possible.
The shimari below is strong, so black must be
pushed against it.

The point is that when you push an opponent
group against your own strong group, you
do not need to respond the opponent's moves
towards the strong group. If you push against
a weak group, you will need to respond and
will lose the initiative.];W[pl]TR[pj]C[This is a bit overconcentrated, because white
would have liked to play at Q10 (marked).
Now black gets a very good move by approaching
the UR corner.];B[qe]C[If white had attacked from above, both white
corners would be strong. Now the UR corner is
weak and white must defend.];W[md];B[of];W[dl]TR[fc]MA[df]C[Black hasn't answered the kakari at F17 (marked),
so white could continue from it.
By creating a weak group here around D8 prematurely, white
will probably enforce the UL black formation
which could have been attacked effectively by starting
e.g. from D14 (marked).

You cannot win if you create weak groups and make
the opponent's groups strong. Try the other way around.];B[cm];W[ck];B[df]
C[Now the black stones are getting connected.
D14 would require answer near J17, but white doesn't
have time to play it now. The kakari at F17 looks a bit
suspicious now.];W[ci]C[Why? White strengthens the black group.
It could be better just to jump out,
at F8 and leave moves here for later
consideration.];B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[dj];B[ei];W[dm];B[dn];W[en];B[eo];W
[fn]C[White has played a lot of stones here,
but accomplished quite little. The both black
groups are strong and white's stones
do not have much further effect. As the upper side
is wide open for black's invasion, I would choose playing
black here.];B[hp]TR[fc]C[Now the both black corners are strong
and the kakari at F17 looks quite thin and useless.
It can become subject of black's attack soon.
The reason is that white attacked too soon at D8.];W[kq];B[ec];W[fd];B[kc]
;W[ic];B[qc];W[pd]TR[qb]C[I would have considered R18 (marked).];B[qd];W
[mf];B[qk];W[ql];B[nh];W[ke]C[This move asks for black to play at K16 and harass
the group on the left.  I think white K16
would have been better. White should ensure
that if the black stone cannot get killed,
then the white groups will get connected.
Otherwise the result will be very bad.
Now white asks black to split.   If black cannot be killed, then black
should be forced to live small in gote,
not to escape between two weak white groups.];B[jd];W[ko]C[This move is dangerous. White just attacked
the black stone at L17. By playing where, white
lets black play another move around K16.
White should keep the upper black group weak
because that would defend also the F17-J17 group.
Now black can play forcing moves against it
and get too easily out with the L17 group.

In other words, white started a fight and then escaped
without much reason. L5 is of course a big point,
but then playing the L15-K16 exhange would have been
better not to play at all.];B[qq];W[pq];B[rp];W[qo];B[rq];W[qr];B[rr];W
[pr];B[rn]
(;W[ro]TR[rm]C[S7 would go for a larger scale capture
(see the variations on previous node).];B[rl];W[qn];B[rm];W[so]C[White captures four black stones, but they were
white's territory anyway. Now black got many
points from S8-S6 in sente. Bad for white.];B[id]C[Now black gets to play the forcing move
against the J17 stone I was afraid of.
White should really have played here instead of
L5.];W[hd];B[if]C[Now black is out and the white group near H16
needs attention.];W[ff]TR[gg]C[G13 could be better, as seen from  black's response...]
;B[gg]C[Now black is basically connected and the white
group surrounded. White should have played
here, keeping the black groups separated for
a little longer.];W[iq];B[hq];W[ip];B[lg]TR[ke][mf][md][pd][pc]C[The white group is surrounded and
needs urgently attention!];W[cn]C[Quite small, as you should take care of the
group that black is surrounding.];B[do];W[bn];B[bo];W[bm]C[White ends in gote and black can continue
attack against the upper right white formation.];B[mb];W[nc];B[mc];W[nb]
;B[ld];W[le];B[nd]C[White made probably a tactical mistake here.
Anyway, even without this cut the white stones
nearby would have got into danger. The reason
is, again, the too strong black group between
white's formations. And, the group is strong
because white allowed black to play twice here.];W[me];B[ne]C[White is seemingly dead.]
;W[od];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[kd];B[lc];W[jc];B[na];W[ie];B[oa]C[Unnecessary, black wasted a move.]
;W[nf];B[oe];W[jf]TR[kl]C[There exist bigger points, such as L8.];B[mq]
C[This invasion is almost ridiculous.
Black should die easily. White must just take
care that N3 does not become a too effective
sacrifice stone for black, i.e. a stone that
is captured unskillfully in a way that gives
black an opportunity to invade the area nearby.];W[mp]TR[mo][km]C[This works for sure, but white is so strong
around that white should play a capturing
move with less aji, e.g. N5 or e.g. L7.
Black cannot make eyes here so I cannot
avoid the feeling that black is tricking here,
and white falls for the trap.];B[no];W[np];B[pm];W[qm];B[ol];W[pk];B[qj]
;W[ok];B[mj];W[mk];B[lk];W[lj]C[Crosscutting here is a call for fight.
But hard to find a good move,
N8 would be submissive and give black
large center.];B[li];W[kj];B[ml];W[nk];B[kl]C[The black group inside white's influence has
got more stones. If black escapes now easily,
the M10-L10 stones will look strange.
White must continue the attack he initiated.];W[kk]TR[lm]C[This is probably a wasted move; white has the ataris N11 and L11 to
save the cutting stones so they do not need defending yet.
I could have played J9 instead.

Also, this removes the possibility of peep at M7
(marked) if black answers.];B[jl];W[ll];B[lm]C[Now the cutting stones have become heavy and
white needs probably to save them instead
of fighting ko here.];W[lk];B[hm]TR[kj][lj][kk][ll][lk]C[... but this is horrible for white.
The crosscut was possibly a bad idea
as the result is mostly a lump of stones.];W[km]TR[ln]C[Better to play at the marked
intersection, capturing the four stones.];B[kn];W[jm];B[jn];W[im];B[in]
;W[il];B[ho]C[Must cut at M6 next!];W[hl]C[Now black will connect...];B
[gm];W[fl];B[ln]C[... here. Compare this with white cut here.
H8 and F8 did not accomplish much;
the black group at E11 removes any possibility
to make territory nearby.

White lost a lot of points here.];W[mm];B[mn];W[nm];B[fo];W[gn];B[hn];W
