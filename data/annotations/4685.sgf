;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[od]C[Is P 17 better?

[wallace\] Hi.
At that point of the game, both are ok.];B[cp];W[po]C[Is R5 better?

[wallace\] Same as before, Q5 or R5 make only a very little difference at your and my level.]

(;B[nq]C[Is this too low, maybe O4?

[wallace\] Yes O4 was possible, and worked a bit better with C4, see var.]
;W[qk]TR[no][qq]C[I think this move is not so good, what would be a better move?

[wallace\] Before extending, it would be better, either to get foot in the corner at R3, or to press B down and jump out at O3. Otherwise this extension might become ither overconcentrated (if B R5) or a bit thin (if B R7).]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[ic]TR[pe][qf]C[[wallace\] Black is greedy! Black should simply extend at any of the 2 marked points (R14 a bit better here), not to get shut in the corner.
If W then takes the extension on the top side B has the initiative.]
;W[gc]TR[qe][pf]C[Maybe black should have played R14, is this a better move for white now, or should white play another move around there (Q14 for instance)? Whats the best way to profit by putting pressure on blacks upper right corner?

[wallace\] There are lots of possibilities. Either Q14 or even R15 directly, or first exchange G17 for M17, then one of those moves.]
;B[lc];W[cj]C[[wallace\] Now W is greedy and wants to take all the board. But the top, where W could have been attacking might now see the opposite...]
;B[fc]C[[wallace\] Strange, contact move, from opposite the weak group :(]
;W[gd]C[[wallace\] B is now split and has just reinforced W...]
;B[pg]C[Is it better for black to play a folow up move at G18 for instance or is Q13 better? It looks like a good move but then why play F17 first? Is it better the other way around?

[wallace\] No, G18 would only make things worse, weakening the J17-M17 group.

Q13 is a bit vague, R14 is better shape (more solid, no weakness at R14)

F17 was not a good move, so...];W[ng];B[ie];W[gf];B[ig];W[gh]
;B[eq]C[Should white strengthen upper left moyo here, whats the biggest move? Or is it more urgent to strenghten the weak white groups on the right side?

[wallace\] For both, the top still seems more urgent.
W O13 group is still unsettled, so B should attack it and W defend it.]
;W[cm]TR[nh][ni][oi]C[[wallace\] small, B doesn't have to answer and could go back to the top, splitting the two W groups of the top right.]
;B[qm]C[Maybe Q7 couldmake better use of O3 with the idea of black building a moyo on the lower side? This may take more territory though, but it also makes white stronger?

[wallace\] W might decide to give up R9... better split the two W formations, the territory will come while attacking.]
;W[pm]
(;B[qo]C[[wallace\] B could be a bit more agressive (see var.)]
;W[pl];B[qp];W[pf]C[What would be blacks best response here?

[wallace\] I think R14 is fine now. B didn't split the 2 W groups, so they are strong, now B can only avoid being shut in the corner and take territory.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[of]C[Is this a bad move?

[wallace\] Well, I don't understand its aim.
B cannot capture the W stone, B will thus get a little group of stones isolated and under attack. Moreover R14 will be under heavy pressure.]
;W[pe];B[qe]C[Would black P13 to keep white seperated and attack the lone white stone be better or is R15 necessary for defence?

[wallace\] R15 is better, but shows that P14 was bad.];W[og]
;B[ph]C[[wallace\] I'm afraid these B stones will only get into trouble, now W is strong on both sides.
Why not simply K4 or C17?];W[qh]
(;B[cf]C[What the best way to invade and use F17? Maybe C17, and after black D17 maybe black can still reduce with E10? or from above or both?

[wallace\] C17 and live underneath (see var). Here C16 by W would be hard on B.]
;W[ce]C[[wallace\] bad shape, leaves C17 open...];B[df]C[Whats the best response for white here?

[wallace\] C15 was bad, so now... may be F16];W[ec];B[di];W[dj]
;B[ei];W[fk]C[[wallace\] good for W];B[ci];W[bi]C[[wallace\] No! Gote, B will live, just descend.]
;B[bh];W[bj];B[ni]C[Is this a good move for black to get out....it didn't turn out so well in the end. Maybe Q11 better putting more pressure on white.

[wallace\] Well, it is urgent to live on the left!!!
What if W B13?];W[oi];B[gi]TR[hi]C[Whats whites best response here, tenuki?

[wallace\] No, continue to attack, and if B lives use the strength built to attack J17 group.]
;W[hh]C[[wallace\] not so bad.];B[fb];W[gb];B[cc];W[eb];B[be]
;W[bf];B[bg]C[Is Black B16 better?];W[bd];B[af];W[cd]TR[jd]
[ih][ji]C[[wallace\] B is very lucky to live, and sente!
But now any W move on J17 group will be tough.];B[le]C[[wallace\] good!]
;W[jp]C[What the best move for white here, the plan was to build territory in the center and reduce blacks bottom. Is killing black upper middle an option? Ataacking it lets build white u center territoy eventualy and also capture black stones there....

[wallace\] K4 is fine, reduces B potential territory there. Attacking B is not urgent after M15. May be K3 a bit better (easier to stabilize)]
;B[hq];W[lg]C[[wallace\] Not coherent with K4, why not M3 or H4...]
;B[pn];W[on];B[qn]TR[jb][kb]C[[since B didn't answer M13 W can now think about moves like K18 or L18.]
;W[oo];B[ih];W[mp];B[fh];W[hf];B[kf];W[li]TR[if]C[[wallace\] Why not push through at least once?]
;B[hb];W[fa]C[Probably H19 better?

[wallace\] almost the same.];B[nm]TR[jj]C[What goes wrong in the next sequence for black and how should it have gone?
Can you tell something about the balanca of the game at tjis point? I think I'd rather be black.

[wallace\] B has 15pts in the top right, almost 20 in lower right and 15 in lower left, plus 5 for the 2 groups. Thus around 55 points.

W has 20 in the top left, 5 on the left. Without komi W needs 30 in the center, which seems a bit difficult.

Thus, B should only reduce, (K10?) instead of going that deep and taking big risks.]
;W[nl];B[mm];W[ml];B[mo];W[np];B[mq]TR[km]C[Maybe M4 bettr for black, defend and attack from the weak side?

[wallace\] May be L4, running out into the center. If M4, W might M5...]
;W[lp];B[ll]C[Maybe just black M7 or L6?];W[lm];B[jr]C[[wallace\] W got a nice present for christmas ;)]
;W[if];B[jf];W[jh]C[[wallace\] Why not cut?];B[ii];W[jj]C[[wallace\] if W cuts, B has to live on top!]
;B[km]C[White wanted first more more grip on the center territory. Would black M6 be better than sacrificing? Center is not that big. White expected M6, if white can't catch N7 group he still needs to connect at P7 probably.

[wallace\] M6 probably not enough for B stones, only bigger sacrifice.
P7 only necessary of W cannot get out to the left.];W[ln];B[kl]
;W[kn]TR[jg][ik]SQ[kl][ll][km]C[[wallace\] W can still cut at K13, threatening moves like K18. then separate B around J9, the marked stones would have been in trouble.]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[ge];W[he];B[hd];W[ff];B[ee];W[ef];B[de];W[hi]

;W[fj];B[eg]TR[fi]C[I think black was afraid to die, but is this realy a threat?

[wallace\] Well B has either to live, or to connect at F11 (and thus to the H6 group).]

[hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[[wallace\] Well B made the first mistakes on the top side, but since W didn't attack there, B managed to get his group out, to live on the left and to take territory.

B was then leading but invaded way too deep into W's framework and ended up giving up a lot there with no counterpart.

Both players need to be more careful about leaving unsettled groups on the board and about reduction vs. invasion (see top left and center, both B invasions, one lived out of two, and none should have, or at least not without weakening dangerously the top group.]
