C[scartol [12k\]: hello there
--
Thank
you in advance for reviewing my game. I feel like I played well overall,
but there were probably some obvious mistakes. Still, I was surprised by
the scale of my loss.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[cq];B[qo]C[I'm not a big fan of the Chinese opening.
I like to get my corners settled quickly, then go fight.
--
It used to be my favourite opening.  But you need to have read a book on it to appreciate how to use it.

I assume you've noticed that C3 is low.  A natural extension from your shimari is K4, which works dangerously well for C3 too.  So I personally would have gone for the chinese here for that reason.]
;W[nc];B[lc]C[seems ok];W[md]C[perhaps not optimal by white]
;B[ld]C[This move is for when you have a stone around Q14.  Here white will jump, b will jump around q14, and white can deal with your wall.  You're better playing more lightly (K17, L16, etc)]
;W[mf];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[gc]C[Yes.  Unfortunate.  You probably need to accept your losses and play J17 here.]
;B[ic]C[This makes everything cramped, but I wanted to get a base if I could.
--
Right. If you wanted to avoid this move, you needed to change M16.]
;W[pj]
(;B[ql]C[B is probably better
--
Just be careful of W R12.  It is surprisingly dangerous.  With R18 sente, w can kill the corner shape.]

(;W[pl];B[pm]C[As I see it, white's goal is to get strong here, and then weaken b with R12 in sente, and then take a key point around K4 in gote. B's best defense is to resolve this in sente, and then play K4 himself.]
;W[ol];B[dp]C[Again, the star point would have been better.
--
Hmmm? This is the star point.  BTW, this joseki isn't very good this early in the game.  Use it when you know you want center influence.]
;W[er];B[cp];W[bq];B[cl]C[...but I like the base I set up on the left.
--
Sure.  But three moves ago your goal was the bottom side, and now white has destroyed that.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[lp];B[ci];W[cf];B[cc]C[tricky.  Ko from memory.]
;W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[ca]C[dead now]
(;W[cd];B[bc]
(;W[qk];B[rl];W[nr];B[oq];W[qg]C[This should be R12.  Overall though, the game is still looking ok.  Your J17 group is looking a little weak now, and it concerns me that your prize territory is now white's.  Sure, you have the left as compensation, but even there, white has a peek under your skirt.]
;B[qf];W[rg]C[I realize I'm getting closed into the corner.]
;B[rf];W[rk];B[ie]C[...but I try to get into the center.
--
Fair enough.  S7 is the worst white can do there.];W[bd];B[bb]
;W[qb]C[This may have been bigger than J15.
--
Probably. It does depend on how much use white can make of the moyo he will build by attacking.  Certainly R18 is double sente.]
;B[rb];W[hb];B[ig]C[I prefer N18 there];W[fp]C[ouch.  I was wondering when that would come.  White is now definatly ahead, but the game is still winnable.  It concerns me that white has a peep into everywhere, if you play your yose poorly you will fall far behind.]
;B[eo]C[I don't like that _at_all_];W[fo];B[dr]C[This was a dumb move for black.
--
I think the previous one was worse.  Black is in real trouble now.  white somehow got a huge gote move in sente, and is now being allowed to seal off a weakness with no loss]
;W[dq];B[eq]
(;W[fq];B[ep];W[ds]C[Mistake, should be F2.  F5 is more important than B3.]
;B[fn]C[Right.  but can you reduce it enough?];W[en];B[dn];W[em]
;B[dm];W[bp]
(;B[bo];W[bn]C[I guess I should have played differently early on to avoid this debacle.]

(;B[bm]C[Oh no!just C5 is fine];W[dh]C[ouch, that went terribly.  Ok, time to reevaluate.  White is one move away from making a game winning moyo on the bottom.  You're left group is small and not getting any bigger.  White's top group isn't much to worry about.  A split around P12 might be useful, but is probably not going to work well enoguh with N18 available, worth keeping in mind though. So, the left it is.  G6? Or just jump in with J5? O5?]
;B[di]C[This seems like the wrong direction];W[ch]C[And by white also.]
;B[ei];W[om]C[and here we have it.  How to save the game from here? I would probably start with G6, looking towards K4.  Whatever happens, you cannot save Q7.]
;B[pn]C[Oh no!];W[le]C[white feels they have won and is protecting the weakness.  I think this is a little premature and they should have finished the bottom first.]
;B[ke];W[ib]C[Bottom is bigger, but this does threaten b a tiny bit.]
;B[jb];W[pc];B[qd];W[kf];B[jf];W[oh];B[kg];W[on]C[White finally realises where the game is.]
;B[gn]C[This felt big.
--
Yes!];W[oo]
(;B[po];W[io];B[el];W[bi];B[bj];W[bg]C[Since M14 is sente, you should probably play that.]
;B[fr];W[cr];B[gr]C[Is there a better way for black to use his position here?]
;W[hp]
(;B[gp];W[gq]
(;B[go];W[hq];B[cn]C[Too small.  Reduce around L8 instead/first.]
;W[im];B[lf];W[mg];B[me];W[ne];B[jk];W[mb]
(;B[lb]C[You shouldn't have answered that.  White played it to get eyeshape.  L8 now would have been very helpful]
;W[le];B[lg]C[Huh? one point?];W[me]C[Huh even more :-)];B[pg]
;W[ph];B[rh]C[ajikeshi on T9, but ok.];W[qh];B[sg];W[ri];B[sh]
;W[si];B[sf];W[ra]C[S12 was a loss there.];B[sc];W[mi];B[lj]
;W[ik]
(;B[fm]C[Oh no!.  you should K8 or similar];W[jh]

;W[ki];B[il]
(;W[hk];B[hl];W[jj];B[jl];W[kk];B[kl]C[Sacrificing the two let me get deep into white's terrain.
--
yes];W[lk];B[ll];W[mk];B[no]C[Probably a silly move, but I have a hard time resisting nearby atari opportunities.

C[Well, overall you played ok.  A couple times you made some big mistakes and they seem to have cost you the game. Trying to find a theme to the mistakes is a little hard.

I notice that you play joseki-like moves without looking at where the joseki ends up, and get yourself into trouble when the sequence favours your opponent.   You also seemed to scare yourself a couple times when no defense was needed, taking gote at critical times in the game, and finally you missed a couple situations where your opponent makes a threatening move that has ambitions elsewhere.  The keima around F4 was the best example, but there was another one when white settled with j18, and again somewhere around P14.

Still, a good game, and while you were behind for most of it, you were still in the running until fairly late.]
