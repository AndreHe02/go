C[Hi there. My name is Ilan. I am currently 5k on kgs, however, I am probably more like 3-4k.

I hope you enjoy the review. If you have any questions feel free to send me an email.]

(;B[qo]C[This move to me seems unusual. But I am sure it is playable. Usually, you want to make the shimari facing your own black stone.]
;W[dd];B[pq]C[This shimari however is fine. I think w should try to play on the bottom side here to avoid black getting a good extension from the shimari]

-- Correct. Absolutely cannot let the weak Q10 group connect so easily]

In terms of SOLID territory,   

black has 19+12 = 31

white has 9+12 = 21


However.. w should profit a off the weak C7 stone...  So its hard for me to judge exactly who is winning off this point...      There are many areas that are still not yet complete. 







The main problem however with judging this position, is that the C7 move is out of place. Please look at the explaination below why it is out of place.]

This move is perfectly fine. And still good for white.];B[cp]

In my eyes actually.. Black seems overconcentrated, the K4 stone seems out of pace]

black is clearly leading, and I don't think at this point w has a chance]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[ii]TR[gi]C[this is a good black move to avoid complications after cap. However. The problem with these 2 moves, is they are not making territory. and only reducing.]

Yes no chance with this kind of invasion. If you have a stone At R7. then maybe you can try something like this.]

One main reason why black lost the game was because black only focused on worrying about the corner / his own territory. and w could easily make territory at   the R8 area, and easily connect the weak p5 group



Also

Black forgot later that black could jump out at C to reduce this area. some how w managed to make 10 points in this C area.  The C area should be dame area]
