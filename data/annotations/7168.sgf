C[Hi, I thought I played fairly well, but this game didn't go so well for me.  I I look forward to your comments!  I'll be marking my comments/questions as "Josh".

Kashomon/Josh

Hi Josh, thanks for your game, it was an intersting one especially because you are struggleing with the same problem as I have how to respond to överplays"of your opponent. 
As far as the game itself is concerned it went downhill for you rapidly after white 34. I think this was mostly due to the aji left by 29.

One of the few changes you had of getting back in the game were move 101 and 109 but unfortunatly you did not see these possibilities. 

The advise I want to give you is to try when attacking make territorty as well, in stead of simply attacking a group without making much profit.
Example moves 9 and 103, try to find a move that does attack but immediatly gives you a better change of making territory as well.]

C[This move is too early. Wait how the game develops before attacking the white group.
Better is to play at A to make territory at the top.];W[rn]
C[Josh: I didn't quite know how to respond to this];B[pj]LB[fc:a]
C[You can also choose to play tenuki now and play at A.];W[qk]

(;B[pi]C[Not good because you create a weak spot.];W[on]LB[fc:a]
C[Josh: This doesn't look so good for me.  I feel like I have to lose sente to get rid of the weakness at Q9

The weakness at Q9 is not really important anymore, white lives and out to the centre. 
Play at A this is a first step in creating an impressive moyo.]

[je][fd]LB[fc:a][ch:b]C[I would play at A, this keeps the corner still open, and strenghtens the 3 stones.

;W[eg];B[dh];W[mb]C[Josh: I'm starting to get pretty worried about my stones on both sides.  I am trying to keep both sets of white stones weak so that I can come back later and attack them, but now it's looking scary for the J17 group.

True, black is the weak group on a site where this used to be a black moyo.]

C[Josh: Still trying to keep W weak.  I think I should have protected the cut at P16.

Problem is that white is alive, Black´s group on the left is eyeless and a move at A white lives and captures the 2 marked stones.

I know what you mean, this seems a bit unreasonable again. As well as unneccessary since white is ahead. Note that capturing at A and a white stone and B looks to promissing for white to attach the right site.

I think the best option is to attack at C, Black will either get the corner or seal white in. You also get some influence on the bottom site as well.]
