C[BeefSaku [1k\]: Hi reviewer - thanks for your time. I'm looking for suggestions on how to improve in the middle-game, where I usually arrive at a great deal of trouble.

* Hi, I'm mafutrct, your reviewer. My comments start with an asterisk *]
;B[pd]C[superpal1 [1d\]: hi];W[dc]C[BeefSaku [1d\]: Hi, have a good game]

(;B[mq]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: Seems normal to me - N3 is solid in the face of white wall and prepares for K3 later

* I don't see a direct problem with this move, but see the alternatives]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[or]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: Feels too slow for black. Was concerned about L3 for white if I omit a move

* Without this move, white can play P2 and live locally with points, while black has to move towards the white influence at H3. P2 is vital here!

* Note that black has no other move that is urgent in any way, so playing steady, and playing the vital point, is good.

* Then black has P2 and N3, so black is locally alive. Also, white cannot enclose b easily.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]LB[pi:A][pj:B][qj:D][pk:C][qk:E]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: All of the pincers seemed vulnerable to counter-pincer, so I played simply. I suspect an attack on the white group on the bottom would have been better, considering my slow move at P2 to take away S2 for white

* I think this move is ok, but your reasoning is a bit too shallow. In this situation, you need to consider
a) If b respons locally (O17), can white make good shape on the right? That is, can white make a good formation in 1 move? This is a fallback option, and it is usually okay-ish. Can white play any of A-E and get very good shape? My feeling is that the answer is "so-so".
b) If black pincers and white counter pincers, it would be a running fight. How would it go? If the fight is good for black, then black must pincer! If the fight is bad, it depends on how good/bad option a) would be in comparison.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qg]LB[qc:A]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: This should be at R7/R8 instead. More urgent than moving a joseki forward

* Playing somewhere on the right should be good, because (see alternative)

* Where exactly on the right? In the upper right, there is nothing urgent (lots of miai). So I think black should play at Q8 right now and see what happens. Later, black can decide what to do in UR.

* Your move is ok, too! No mistake!];W[pg];B[qh]
(;W[ph];B[rf];W[qe];B[qj]
(;W[ql]LB[qg:A]C[* White is playing away! This means black's A was good!]
;B[pi]LB[oi:B][ri:A]C[* This is super big, because now white is a) not alive and b) Q14 became an important cutting point (usually Q14 is not very interesting because the white outside is already too large and can just run away easily)

* Be a bit careful with aji at A (in combination with white B)]
;W[qc]
(;B[kc];W[ic]
(;B[de]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: I thought a long time about this move... I feel like I need to play in the top right (maybe L15?), but never saw a move I liked. So, tenuki

* Black must play Q17!]
(;W[dg];B[fe];W[fc];B[cc];W[cb];B[dj]C[* This creates a LOT of weak and/or groups on this board. Complicated fight ahead.]
;W[ef]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: this move feels crude...

* It can make b heavy. I think it is a mistake, but b must be careful.]
;B[ee];W[gg]LB[gc:C][cg:B][fg:A]C[* White is fast with this move, but remember that white is also very thin here. This means black can easily make life locally or break through if the fight gets tough.

* For instance, much aji at A, B or C.];B[he];W[cl]C[* Even MORE weak groups.... the game becomes more complicated]
;B[dn]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: maybe better to protect B5 peep... but this has such a big effect on the white wall

* Difficult to say. Black can play B6 instead of D6 to protect, but it feels too slow and submissive. Your move has future potential with moves like F5 or F4, so your move is more active.]
;W[el];B[bm]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: This move was a mistake I felt. Only helped white

* Yes this is too slow, and helps white. Black avoids a fight even though he could fight, and this tips the balance towards white.]

(;B[hm]LB[hm:A]C[* This is the less interesting side. It makes the 3 black stones weaker, so we can only play here if we follow up with a severe attack, but that is not possible.]

(;B[gj];W[ig];B[jj];W[je]LB[fm:B][hm:A]C[BeefSaku [1k\]: At this point it's a big failure for black I think... too many weak stones

* Yes. Black spent moves at A and B that made it more difficult to fight, and eventually this meant white got sente to play here.

* This black should be able to live, but not in a nice way]
