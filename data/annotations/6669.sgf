AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Thanks for the review.

In this three-stone handicap game, I can see points where I was "tricked", but in reviewing the game, the correct responses still aren't obvious to me.  Any help would be appreciated!]
;W[dd];B[pj];W[dj];B[jp];W[qq]C[pmurphy:  The first in a string of unreasonable-seeming 3x3 invasions.  I followed a previous reviewers advice to continue to extend along the bottom as long as white cares to, but I think I may have needlessly given up sente at the end.

switch: you played it perfect (except one minor move) don't worry about playing something else as the 3x3 is not very clever here.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql];W[pr]
;B[or];W[qr];B[oq]LB[nq:A][os:B]C[A is better; now B is sente for white.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[cm];W[bm];B[cl]
;W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq]LB[fq:A][es:B]C[switch: same here];W[gp]
;B[gq]LB[dg:E][dj:F][fl:D][gl:B][in:C][gp:G][hq:A]C[pmurphy:  In retrospect I'm not very happy with this move.  I was worried about the life of my western group.

switch: what would you have done with an 14k as opponend? would you also be worried about? ... its one single stone against a very thick wall. 

I would ignore it ... even with a second stone later played in this area white would have lots of trouble getting life itself 

Ok how about your answer!? ... you move is very bad here.

If you like to attack that white stone you should not touch it. The next logical move for white is A, leaving your stone with 2 liberties against 2 stones with 3 liberties each ... you are in defence

I would have played something around E ... if you worry about your stones D or B would be nice as white has to connect F and G somehow to catch your stones.]
;W[hq];B[hp]C[mostly the cross-cut is a bad move. you are complicating the situation which is wrong in your case as YOU are the strong one in this area. 

you should complicate only if you are somehow behind or weak.]
;W[ip];B[ho];W[iq]
(;B[fp]LB[gp:A]C[that stone is wasted as A is already yours ...]
;W[io]
(;B[hn]C[you don't need to protect that 2 stones; there are not that helpless.]
;W[in];B[jd]LB[jp:A][jq:C][lq:B]C[that stone is the next logical target for white B or C is nessesary ...]
;W[kp];B[jo];W[ko]C[ok. compare that situation to move 45. 

45: your stones have 2 liberties,
47: your stones have 2 liberties.

95% of all moves adding 2 liberties to a group are wrong.

white gets strength, you get nothing.];B[jn];W[im];B[jq]C[lucky ... white should have connected.]
;W[kq];B[kn]LB[jr:A]C[seperating at A may have been better ... it would be hard for white to protect 2 groups ( without a base or eyespace! ) at the same time]
;W[jr];B[ln];W[mp];B[mq]LB[dj:E][gk:C][gl:B][lr:A]C[again, don't touch what you are attacking !!! 

How about A (destroying eye-space) B or C (keeping the white stones seperated to attack E ...]
;W[lq]C[i don't get it ..];B[lo]LB[mr:A]C[no! you gain nothing here ...

white can't make an eye here; it would be a false eye ...

How about A?];W[nq];B[mr];W[nr];B[np];W[lp]C[you are lucky ...]
;B[mo];W[lr]
(;B[ms]LB[ls:A]C[no! that makes A a sente move!];W[kr];B[qg]
LB[jk:A][gr:B]C[hmm ... how about A or B

the white group needs 2 eyes to life ...];W[hm];B[fm];W[qc]
;B[qd]LB[jd:B][qg:A]C[pmurphy:  Right direction?

wrong one ...

A is to close for the wall you get now ... B would be perfect for a wall going down and A could give you sente this time ;)]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[lc];W[rd];B[re]
;W[rc];B[fc]LB[dd:B][df:A][dg:D][dj:C]C[How about A or D? Attacks B and C at the same time.

you could do that as there is not a single weak black group that could be attacked by white]
;W[ne];B[ng]LB[od:A][lg:B]C[right spirit ...

the cut at A would not work as both black groups can live itself ... 

But i would play at B as than there is absolute nothing the white stone can flee to ... now white could try to  connect somehow to the center.]
;W[mf];B[jg]LB[lh:A]C[A creates a mojo for black


but the other side is open so black only attacks without gaining something if the attack fails]
;W[mg];B[mh];W[lh];B[kf]LB[nh:B][mi:A]C[huh????

if you like to cut ... DO IT

you stones gives white some time to recover and strengthen it stones

A would be nice as W can cut at B catching one of your stones ...]
;W[lg]C[whit gets strong now];B[mi];W[li];B[mj];W[lj];B[lk]
;W[kj];B[dc]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[A or B!

if white connect its stones it would be big];W[cc];B[db];W[cb]
;B[ed];W[de];B[ee];W[og];B[oh];W[nf];B[nh]LB[df:B][dh:A]C[no ... 

just ignore it ... its worth nothing ...

there is still something at A or B possible];W[pg]

yes ... and it looks ugly also ...

;W[jj];B[gk]LB[ij:A]C[I like A];W[no]C[pmurphy:  after this move by white i decided to cut my losses and try to end up with white being locked out of my eastern group.]

(;B[op];W[nn];B[on];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm];B[om]LB[hi:B][lj:A]C[no!

catch the Dragon at A whith B e.g.];W[ii];B[hh]LB[gj:B][hk:A]
C[too close; there is also a weakness at A so B would be better this time]

;W[ek]
(;B[fh]C[pmurphy:  I completely forgot about the J9 group during this fight, I think I could have saved it with H8


... see var.];W[ei]C[the dragon is gone ...


ill stop reviewing here as i see no way for black to win this game or any unclearness.

I hope my review helped and sorry if my english sounds a bit weird sometimes ;)]
