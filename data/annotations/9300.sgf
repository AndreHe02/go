C[DanielTom (DT) – Hi Tilwen, nice to meet you.

I discussed this game with a friend on KGS, "gisel" 4d, who kindly allowed me to share his helpful comments with you. (Thanks gisel!)

At the end of this file (last move) you can find a list of advice/lessons you can learn from this game.

Hope you enjoy the review.];B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[de];W[ce]

(;B[dd];W[cd];B[ec];W[df];B[cc];W[db];B[bc];W[eb];B[fc];W[ef]
;B[fe];W[bd];B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[bb]C[DT – Perfect so far.]

(;B[fb]LB[bg:A]TR[cf][cg]C[DT – This was your first mistake. Black's move here is not sente, so it's very slow (2nd line).

Also, this group is already strong. The marked stones are weaker, so they should be your priority.

Black A instead is correct (joseki). See var.];W[bg];B[ad]C[DT – Wasted ko threat.]
;W[be];B[ch];W[eh]
(;B[cn]LB[dj:A]TR[cf][cg][ch]C[DT – The marked stones became heavy because of Black's mistake in joseki, so it's hard for him to find a good plan here.

gisel - I think Black A is fine. See var.];W[cl]TR[cf][cg][ch]
C[DT – Good idea to pincer (keeps the marked stones under pressure).]

(;B[en]LB[cq:A]C[DT – The peaceful way is to invade at A. See var.]
;W[el]C[DT - Good move!];B[fp];W[bp]
(;B[bo]LB[gn:A]C[DT - Black plays here when he wants to keep White's stones separated (i.e., when he can attack them). But in this position I feel it is too aggressive and risky. Black A instead is honte.

gisel - This move is too optimistic.];W[fo];B[eo];W[ep]
(;B[gp]LB[fq:A]C[DT - Black A is the aggressive way. See var.]
;W[gn]TR[cf][cg][ch]C[gisel - Black has too many weak groups now. His marked stones now seem as good as dead.]
;B[fm];W[in]
(;B[ho]C[DT - See var.];W[hn];B[gl]LB[jp:A]TR[hn][ho]C[DT - If Black wants to be consistent, he has to follow up with keima at A. Otherwise, the marked exchange only makes White stronger.]
;W[jp]C[gisel - Black got surrounded here. It's bad for him.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[er];W[dr];B[cr]
(;W[eq]LB[fr:A]C[DT - Black overplayed, but White played really bad shapes here and somehow managed to die...

gisel - White A instead looks better.];B[fr];W[fq];B[gr];W[gq]
;B[hq];W[dq];B[bq]C[DT - Surprising move!];W[dn]C[DT - Too late now, because White filled his own liberties before.]
;B[do];W[co];B[ap]C[gisel - Groups are dying like flies in this game.]
;W[op];B[dk];W[dl]
(;B[di]C[DT - Greedy, and narrow focus (too local). See var.]
;W[fj]C[DT - Black got surrounded again.];B[ei];W[fi];B[ek]
;W[fk];B[fl];W[ck];B[cj];W[ej];B[dj];W[bj]C[DT - Black didn't achieve anything here.]
;B[fh];W[dh];B[ci];W[bi]
(;B[oq]LB[pn:A]C[gisel - Black A instead is better. See var.]
;W[nq];B[pq];W[np]
(;B[gi]LB[mc:A]C[gisel - Another locally-centered move... he couldn't forgive himself for dying there.

DT - It's sente, so it should be okay.

gisel - But I think it is a bit premature. I would play at A instead.]
;W[bh]
(;B[qn]LB[mc:A]C[gisel - I still think Black should play at A. See var.

DT - Indeed, Black is not that strong at the top.];W[nc];B[lc]
LB[qn:A]TR[fb][ec][fc][dd][de][fe]C[DT - Pincer is correct. It supports the marked group. (Also, the right side is not that important because the A stone is low.)]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf]C[DT - Good result for Black.

gisel - Yes.]
(;B[og]LB[jd:C][gh:A][io:B]C[gisel - First feeling is for Black to connect at A. He can also aim at cutting White with B.

DT - Hmm, it looks like Black is ahead, so maybe he should just defend at C. See var.]
;W[jc]LB[nb:A]TR[fb][ec][fc][dd][de][fe]C[DT - Good point, very brave invasion!

gisel - This one is hard to kill, even to chase properly, because of the weakness at A.

DT - Now Black should cap this stone. He has to be careful because his marked group is not that strong.]

(;B[qg];W[qe]
(;B[kd]LB[je:A]TR[fr]C[gisel - Black is too weak to kill this stone, so White's invasion was fine.

DT - Black should still play cap at A. See var.];W[ie];B[ff]
;W[fg];B[gg];W[gh];B[hg];W[jg]
(;B[if]LB[jf:A]C[DT - Bad shape. Keima at A is the proper way to cut.]
;W[je];B[jf];W[ke];B[kf];W[le];B[mc];W[pf];B[of];W[ne];B[nd]
;W[mg]C[DT - White played really well. Black was tricked, lost all his territory, and his own group is still weak.]

(;B[pj]LB[mi:A]C[DT - I think capping at A is better. See var.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[mi]
(;B[lh];W[lg];B[kh];W[kg];B[hh];W[md];B[nb];W[oe];B[od];W[pl]
LB[oi:A]TR[nk][ql]C[DT - White clearly outplayed Black.

gisel - Yes, aggressive tygem style.

DT - Now Black's shapes are very weak, so it's difficult for him to attack White's center. Maybe he should defend at A here to make the marked points miai (see var).]

(;B[ql];W[pi]LB[qj:A]TR[of][og][qg]C[DT - Very interesting probe. Perhaps Black should sacrifice the marked stones and pull back at A, but then White would be ahead.

gisel - That way Black might not be able to win, so he has to take his chances.]
;B[pg]C[gisel - But this one by Black...];W[qj]LB[oi:A]C[DT - This was good for White.

gisel - Black should now play at A directly, but even then it's hard to attack White, because Black's own group in the center is weak.]

(;B[qi];W[ri]
(;B[qh]LB[oi:A]C[DT - This connection is bad, of course. Black had to play atari at A and sacrifice one stone. See var.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[rl];B[oi]C[gisel - This was heavy for Black.]
;W[qm];B[mh];W[nh];B[ni];W[jh];B[lj];W[ji];B[kj];W[hj];B[fh]
;W[kb]C[DT - White escaped again.]
(;B[jd];W[id]
(;B[ic]LB[lb:A]C[DT - Black needs to defend at A in order to live.]
;W[hc];B[ld];W[me];B[eg];W[dg];B[ib];W[lb]C[DT - Black probably missed this move.]

(;B[mb]LB[jb:A]C[DT - Should atari at A.];W[hb]C[DT - Now Black is 100% dead.]
;B[jb];W[ja];B[kc];W[ia];B[jc];W[ka];B[ma];W[oa];B[gd];W[hd]
;B[lp];W[lq];B[kq];W[kp];B[mq];W[lr];B[mr];W[mp];B[kr];W[ls]
;B[nr];W[lo]LB[hh:A]C[gisel - There is nothing Black can do anymore.

DT - Yes. Black was crushed. Later his A group also died.];B[io]
;W[hi];B[ge];W[fg];B[ha];W[ga];B[eg];W[ee]C[DT - White wins by resignation.

Let's make a summary.

We've seen that, in the fight at the top, you missed two important cap moves (moves 105 and 125), and your direction of play was questionable. The way you tried to cut White was not good. He outplayed you, and even killed two dragons inside what originally was your own moyo.

While it is difficult to review chaotic games such as this one, they are always fun to watch, and can be instructive. When it comes to fuseki, and early middle-game, here are the lessons I feel you can learn from this game:

 # Defend the weaker stones. (Move 23, F18 should be B13)

 # When near thickness, play solidly. (Move 35, B5 should be G6)

 # Avoid playing moves that only make your opponent stronger. (Move 43, H5 should be J4)

 # Don't be greedy. Think globally. (See variation for move 67)

In general, "gisel" agrees with these points, and has his own advice to give:

 # Take care of weak groups first (again, see e.g. your joseki mistake in the upper left corner).

 # Do not divide as much (see move 40) - in running fights it's important to keep your weak group count low.

 # Don't get too caught up in local situations: there are times when you must tenuki (see move 67, D11).

 # Try to not get surrounded because it hurts, and pay more attention to the global position.

---

And that's it for this review. I hope you can take something from it.
My thanks to gisel again for his valuable input.
