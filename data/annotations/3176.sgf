;B[dp]C[wjzz [23k\]: :-D];W[dd];B[jq];W[qn]C[Note: was that move ok? i mean, should i play P16 or F17 instead?

[ Usually you would want to take your corner with P16 or P17, but in the case where black plays a move like K3 or K4 here, your move is good. \]]
;B[cf];W[ci];B[ef];W[cm]C[[ Usually you would want to play F16 now.  I guess you are worried that if you play F16, black will attack C11.  But now you leave D16 all by itself and very weak.  This costs you a lot later. \]]
;B[oc]C[how respond to a move like that?

[ There are many ways to respond to a move like that.

You can attack it by playing a "pincer" on the other side of it.  Some moves that do this are N17 and M16.

Or you can try to strengthen your side position while preparing for an even stronger attack on that stone, with a move like Q15 or P15.

There are many other moves that will work here, it  depends on what style of game you like to play. \]]
;W[od]C[[ This move isn't great, but its ok.

It might be a really good move if you already have a nice wall around where R6 is.

But this is a tough position for me, so I'm not sure what move would be a lot better for you. \]]

;B[ge];W[he];B[hg];W[if]C[[ By playing J14, you are setting up a difficult fight for yourself.

You won't be able to quickly kill the black stones at H14, so it means you will have to worry about G14, J14 and H16 groups all at the same time.  Black will also have 3 disconnected groups, but only H14 is weak. \]]
;B[hh];W[je]C[[ Ouch!  This is a very bad move! 

The reason is that you make black play J16.

Before you black plays J16, you can catch G15 in a ladder starting with White F15.  But after black plays J16, you can't capture it anymore.  This is why D16 gets disconnected and dies later in the game, giving black a very big corner. \]]
;B[id];W[fe];B[gd]C[[ See?  If you didn't do K15, black wouldn't have time for J16, and so you could play G17 instead here... \]]

It isn't so bad for you here though, because you give black a nice corner, but you get a nice wall towards your right side. \]]

;B[rr];W[go]C[should i played S5 instead?

[ S5 is would work here.  S4 is probably better.

But adding *another* stone there now is slow, and maybe after that black could play G5...  So, I like your idea of G5... \]]

C[could i live here?

[ I don't think so.  The black stones are too strong, so you weren't even able to get one eye. 

But I don't mean to say you should not try.  You must try things like this to learn when it will work, and when it will not work. \]]
;B[mq];W[kn];B[mp]TR[jo][ko][lo][mo]C[[ N4 is a wasted move by black.  Maybe he is worried that you will try to kill the marked group, so he wanted to connect it.  But you could not play N4 yourself, so he didn't have to worry.

The bad part is that you play L2 here.  You cannot save your stones, anymore, so you should not try.  Black wasted a move so try to exploit it. \]]

[ It is important to remember that not every invasion can be killed, but here you are so strong, and black doesn't have much room, so killing should be possible. You did everything right until the end.  Step forward to see my comments there. \]]
