C[Hello, I'm Daniele, your reviewer.
I'll review this game for Black side. I will start my comments by "R:" 
I hope this will be useful to you
I'm sorry if I may seem harsh on some comments, it's just to strongly discourage you from certain plays, I have no intention of being rude.
You played a fine game.
You have to revise some strategical concept, but most of all some shape-related concept and you should strive for sente, especially in the endgame.
At the end of the game I summarized all my remarks about the game.
I'm sorry that I'm not a native English speaker, so maybe sometimes my english can be unclear.
Should you have any questions, please feel free to ask me, via email or via kgs (main nickname: ilfuria).

Enjoy]
(;B[pd];W[dp]
(;B[pp];W[dd];B[fc]TR[dd][dp]C[I like this opening because I can understand it (I think) and it has me on the attack straight away.

R: it's quite a common opening. It's right you attack almost right away. It is not the only opening that features an early attack but if you like this one stick to it. I think it's quite simple so very good for you.
Anyway I made a couple of variations where you can see other attacking openings against the two white stones]
;W[ec]C[This doesn't look like a great move to me (it's what I used to play when I was 25k) - it seems cramped. I'm not sure if my response was correct, but it seemed like we ended up with a fairly even outcome in this corner.

R: this is not a joseki, you have the advantage of making an extension on the side.]
;B[fd]C[R: your response is correct];W[cf];B[jd]TR[jc]C[Played here as opposed to a safer extension (e.g. J17 or K17) because I wanted to make the most of F17 stones. Perhaps an overplay?

R: remember "from a wall of two, extend three". So your extension is correct. I think I would've made an extension on k17 to strike a better balance with 3rd and 4th line but, if you play for influence I guess this is correct too]
;W[qf]
(;B[nc]C[R: this move isn't so good in this case. A pincer would be better for black (see variations).
In fact you play on a side where you already have 5 stones and do not use well the extension k16.]
;W[qj]C[This seems a BIG extension from W, but I didn't want to attack it straight away. I thought I would approach the other corner and try to exploit this later.

R: it is a big extension but is sometimes played, even if q10 is the right joseki for white. Since your corner is still open for invasion, this move is ok
Good thinking about attacking the other corner: white ended gote so you should exploit your sente]
;B[fq];W[hq]
(;B[fo]C[Aiming at D6 and H4 areas.
R: I think the best and simplest response here would be to jump in the corner. See variation]
;W[dn];B[ho]C[Making good on the threat. But perhaps something like J4 would have been better?

R: yup, j4 is better as I explained to you at move 10.];W[jp]
;B[dr]LB[gl:A][gm:B]C[This seemed like a necessary move at the time to prevent the three stones above ending up floating, but I'm not so certain now.

R: I think that jumping into the centre at A or B would be better for your stones. this move is kind of a waste, since invites white to close his corner which could be useful to save f3 stone in case of disconnection from g5.]
;W[cq];B[gr]C[I think this is a mistake - it's gote and doesn't achieve much. I should have extended from my Q4 stone, probably to somewhere around N3, aiming at taking the base from white's two stones.

Now white is able to approach my corner, making a base for his stones on the bottom side in the process.

R: I think this all descends from d2. you should not worry about the approach move to your corner since, by extending on the right, you will be able to successfully split the r14-r10 stones]
;W[nq]TR[lq]C[R: remember that white has a very weak point there, which you can exploit later]
;B[qn]TR[qm]C[R: I don't know if it's joseki, but I would've tried a mor loose solution with r7, which makes much more pressure on the right stones]
;W[pr];B[qq]LB[ql:A][qr:B]C[R: seein the next moves: remember that your corner group has miai for living in A or B]
;W[qm]C[I realised in advance that white could pressure me like this if I played the usual way, but I had a plan...
R: as long as you know that r2 is very dangerous for your corner group]
(;B[np]TR[lq]C[...this move. The aim is to attack white's lower group and stop my corner group being penned in. However, I'm unsure now if this was a good move. Maybe I just liked it because it looks pretty...

R: contact moves are never attack moves, they're always defensive moves. Beisdes from that I think that s7 would've been a much better response, making instant room. Even q7 looks good, since lets you expand to the centre.
Another choice (but I think is quite complicated and don't know if it's correct) could've been to clamp at r8 and then bridge underneath or above (see variation)
since white has a weakness in m3 I think your move is ajikeshi (=you make your opponent fix his weakness). Of course, after r7 from white your group has become kind of weak so you can't exploit m3 just yet]
;W[mp]C[R: now m3 is not a weakness anymore];B[oq]C[R: bad shape. you should've extended in o5]
;W[nr];B[or]C[Mistake, I think, allowed W to play the atari at O5...but it seemed important to prevent W from linking underneath. This doesn't seem so big now.

R: yes I removed a comment before. white should've ataried you in o5 and then he could've played o2. I think you could've played o5 first which looked better.
Now your group is in trouble since it is under heavy attack from every direction and cannot escape safely to the center (the lack of o5 black can be troublesome)]
;W[no];B[op]TR[mo][mq]SQ[os]C[Gote, but I thought for a while and couldn't let W capture. Now my corner looks in very bad shape.
R: I think this is a very dangerous response. white has some weaknesses in  the marked points but your eyespace is reducing move after move. Instead of here I would've safely responded in p1 taking the corner.]
;W[rd]
(;B[qc]C[R: I'm not sure the corner here is the biggest point. YOu can avoid his automatic response. see variations]
;W[hr];B[fm]C[W looks thin on the left side, but I didn't want to invade too early (I do that a lot, and it doesn't work, for me at least). The purpose of this move is to run into the middle while threated a play on the left side.

R: it's not too early. but I agree that h2 is a severe move, so you should reinforce your stones. anyway you push white to protect his weaknesses]
;W[ck];B[jo]TR[of]C[Closing in, trying to make strength towards the middle.

R: good plan, it works well with your upper stones. Now, though, your r17 stones looks misplaced: it could've looked better in p14]
;W[kp]
(;B[dj]TR[fd][fm]C[My plan is: if W blocks at C10, I can connect to my lower group and reduce her territory on the left. If W blocks at D9, I can invade and maybe connect to my top group.

R:I think this is a very weak move. too loose. you make white reinforce himself with the natural d9 move and he can invade  your moyo easily; furthermore, the left side is not as interesting as the right onw, since you have the marked stones to protect your moyo from a white invasion, while on the rightyou have none.

see variations (move 40 for moyo and protecting, this move for white response]
(;W[cj];B[dk];W[di];B[ei];W[dh];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[rc]
SQ[fm][fo][ho]C[This seems like a small move, I regret it now. The D7 group looks weak and more plays there seem necessary...perhaps G4.

R: yes, you are (imo) addicted to the one-point jump or the square form which is good but for sacrifice. it has a weak point. white could've disconnected you (see variation)]
(;W[eb]
(;B[fb]CR[rd][qf][qh]SQ[en]C[R: this is not good. white move threatens nothing apart a monkey jump.
instead you could've:
played on the square-marked point, to defend your group
or
try and attack white group(circles). In this case even a pressing attack to make moyo can be good (see variation)]
;W[ke]C[R: bye bye moyo];B[kd]C[Happy to block on the 4th line.
R: yes but the point is that your center moyo project will be no more]
;W[le];B[md]TR[ke][le][qf][qj][qm][no][kp]C[Trying to stay ahead.
R: again, the upper side isn't the point here. white is trying to make a moyo where you should've had yours.]
;W[gp]C[W takes G4 and things don't looks so good.

R: this is due to your shape, you should be aware of these weaknesses when you play those shapes]
;B[fp];W[go];B[gn];W[gq]
(;B[in]TR[en]C[Not sure what I was thinking with this move. E6 or thereabouts seems important for safety of D7 group.

R: you're in some trouble: first of all I don't like this shape (a solid connection would've been better) but the weakness you should really worry about is the double peep at e6. Even if white does not disconnect you, he can make your situation worse I provide a couple of variations]
(;W[hm];B[hn];W[en];B[fn]C[The only move here, I think, unless I want the stones below to be lost.
R: of course];W[he]TR[em];B[hd]CR[em]C[R: you should fix your second weakness. h16 is unimportant]
;W[ie];B[id];W[fk]C[I think I should have ensure the safety of the D7 group now, but I thought I had read it that it could either connect below or run away above, so I delayed.
R: your group is OK, you can connect directly via e7, which is the safest way]
;B[ef]LB[ec:A][dd:A][ie:B][ke:B][cf:A]C[My next few moves were aimed at not letting W's corner get any huger, while building strength to maybe attacj the H15 group later (assuming I jump out around O14.)

But I'm sure if I really achieved anything with this sequencwe but strengthening white.

see variation]
(;B[gs];W[ar];B[bs];W[es];B[fr];W[ds]TR[ro][sp][rq]C[R:
well I'll try and summarize the basic concept I think you should learn from this game.

Strategically I think you have to learn better the correct direction of play and try to pincer and deal with pincers. remember that a pincer is best when it also is an extension, but it's good too if it forces you to complex moves or to live small.
Furthermore you should learn to make moyos not only on the sides but also to expand them to the center.
You should analyse better both strenght and weaknesses of your groups and your opponents.
Then you should stick to the three golden rules, which I rewrite in order of importance:
1) if you have a weak group fix that
2) if you have no weak groups but your opponent has, attack that
3) otherwise play the biggest move
Regarding attack and planning I think you should evaluate all the possibilities and be more flexible. When you spot a weakness in the opponent's groups try to make the biggest profit, try to split, stay strong and attack two weak groups at the same time. Then if it doesn't work try for the smaller target and change your plans.
Flexibility means also to try and make the best of your stones potential even if they weren't placed there to make a certain thing (can be territory, influence, thicnkess…) you should dynamically change your plans to use at best your stones if they can have multiple purposes. (e.g. the moyo on the upper side)

I think the worst problem you have is shape. You make too many "square" shapes (two one-space jumps as in move 17) without considering that it is a sacrifice shape and has weaknesses. You also have to think about connecting the best way, which is more often than not SOLIDLY. You exceed with the cat's shape--the marked shape is only for reference, it is good shape in the example, I have told you where and when it was not during the review-- (which, in the end has proven to be disastrous), especially on the border. 

The last thing I want to say it's about endgame: you should try and make SENTE moves before other moves, and keep in mind that a 5 point sente move is worth like a 10-point gote move.

I hope you can use this review to do much better and, maybe, one day to beat me!

basic: upper side= safely black
left side= safelly white

A group: stable, it cannot expans much
B groups: can live in the centre even if they have a weakness they might connect to A group (via F14) or almost-connect to C (via o14)
C group and D : very weak, especially after s17. weakness in q12 can bring to a split attack from black which will probably bring D to trouble (C can connect to B)
E group: kind of safe. P1 would make it live while n3-n5 weakness can help too.
F-I group: weak, it can be disconnected from the I group anytime via E7 thanks to H. both groups don't have ANY eye, since white can play f2. then H and G stones will probably be split and attacked
G-H stones: very very weak. black shouldn't let them connect. H stone serve the purpose to disconnect F from I (see variation starting with white 74)

Now that we've evaluated the situation we should stick to the three golden rule for strategy (they are most applicable in the opening but here they're very useful too). The order of priority of the rules is the following:
1) If you have a weak group FIX IT
2) IF the opponent has a weak group ATTACK IT
3) otherwise play the biggest move on the board.

It's clear now that we
FIRST should fix at least the F-I groups.
then (if we think the E group as safe) we should attack the opponent's weak(est) group. which is represented by the H and G groups.
