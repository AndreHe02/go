AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,
I am a 6kyu on KGS who plays under the account "Bmaj7b5".
Thank you for sending me this game, I will be happy to review it.
It was fun game to watch.
Joseph];W[dd];B[pq];W[po]LB[qo:A]TR[pd]C[J: High approach is not as good with Black's marked stone.  High approach is for moyo-style, but unfortunately White moyo is already limited by the stone on Q16.  I would have played the low approach.]
;B[np]TR[dp]C[J: Black's response is good.  It is moyo-orientated and Black has the 4-4 moyo stone at D4.  It is good fuseki shape.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[iq]TR[pd]SQ[po][qp][qq]C[J: White's shape would like to develop along the right side, but Black already has a stone in the top right.  White is cramped.  The White stones  need an immediate base.]
(;W[cn]LB[qm:A]C[J: Here, I would like to play a Joseki that gives Black sente, so Black can immediately punish White at "A" for leaving his stones weak.  Can you find such a Joseki?]
(;B[ck];W[fp];B[fq];W[gq]
(;B[fr]C[J: If you descend to the second line early, there is always a better shape move.]
;W[gp]
(;B[io]C[jada:  too soon.  the corner needs defending.
J: I agree, J3 is safe for now.  I would defend the corner, make the white stones heavy, and disconnect his groups.]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[er]
(;B[gr]TR[fq][fr]C[J: These stones are already lost because you made poor shape by descending to the second line.  However, G2  weakens your territory further by building  White thickness.  It is bad to make a move that builds your opponent's thickness.  I would still attack the C6 stone and disconnect it from the other White group.]
;W[hr];B[hq];W[ir];B[jr];W[gs]
(;B[dr]LB[jq:A]C[J: D2 is gote and doesn't accomplish much.  And notice that by playing G2, you left bad aji (potential) at A.  This cut could be bad later.  I would still attack the C6 stone.]
;W[em];B[co];W[cm];B[ch]C[J: Good.];W[cf];B[fh]LB[fc:B][qm:A]
TR[ch][ck]C[jada:  the remaining side points or enclosing the top right would probably have been bigger.
J: I agree.  I would attack the stones on the right (because it is urgent) before approaching the top left.  I would not play around C9 or C12.  Your group has a base so it is safe.]
;W[pj]C[J: Black misses the big point and White gets away with his mistake.]
;B[qg]LB[fc:A][pj:B]C[J: A is a bigger point, but your move is good because it puts pressure on the White shape.  Since B is high, he is open to a territory invasion.]
;W[jd]C[J: Black is a bit behind in development.];B[lc];W[nc]
C[jada:  whit seems to have a good lead.
J: Yes, Black missed two opportunities to play a fast  fuseki.  From here, I would attack the invading stone, secure the corner, then run with M17.  It is good to make invading stones thick so the pressure of capture is bigger.]
(;B[le];W[ne];B[mg]LB[pc:A][jd:B]TR[lc][le]C[J: I would secure the corner first.  A is a strong move.  Your group already has access to the center, as it is ahead of the stone at B.]
;W[og]
(;B[nh]C[J: This is the wrong direction.  Black's corner and side is looming with disaster.  It may soon be lost.]
;W[ph];B[qi]LB[pc:A][qf:B]TR[pd][qg]C[J: This is too ambitious.  Right now, it is important to secure the corner, or link up your stones with A or B.]
;W[pi];B[nj];W[pl]
(;B[ig]C[jada:  this might have been better at K14
J: Center territory is not very important.  I would attack the top White shape.]
;W[mm];B[lk]LB[fc:A]TR[cm][em][mm][cn][fp][gp]C[J: It is not wise to play a center territory game right now.  The center territory will shrink very quickly.  Also, the White stones facing towards the center reduce the possible center territory to be made.  The approach at A, however, is critical.]
;W[lo]LB[jq:A]C[J: Bad move by White.  It forces Black to strengthen himself, secure territory,  and might reduce the aji at A.]
;B[lp];W[jm]
(;B[ik]C[J: There is too much focus in the center, which is incorrect.]
;W[fj]LB[ek:A]
(;B[ej]LB[ek:A];W[gl];B[fd];W[ff]
(;B[ge];W[hf]C[J: White cannot get away with this play.]
(;B[he];W[gf];B[if];W[gh]
(;B[eg];W[ef];B[dg];W[df];B[ic]C[jada:  i was so happy to get this point  : )
J: I like it a lot :)];W[pb];B[qc];W[jc]
(;B[kb];W[jb];B[hb];W[fb];B[ec]C[J: Good invasion.];W[dc];B[eb]
;W[db];B[ea];W[da];B[ii]LB[qh:A][rr:B]C[jada:  this might have been better at H11
J: This is better than H11.  
While this move helps you connect, it isn't very urgent.  You give sente away.  A and B are what I think are big points.]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[kp];B[lq];W[ip];B[hp];W[ho];B[bg]C[J: Good, it's sente.]
;W[bf]
(;B[pf];W[of];B[qb];W[nb];B[rk]C[jada:  an overplay.  needed to defend at R12 first
J:  Yes :)];W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[rj];W[si];B[sh];W[qj];B[rf]
;W[il]
(;B[nl];W[nm];B[ok];W[pk]
(;B[jk]LB[ie:A]C[J: This isn't as important as the cut, which could cause a liberty race at some point.]
;W[hj]
(;B[ij];W[hk];B[mo];W[ln];B[rq]LB[rr:A]C[J: This move gives up Sente for a few additional points.  I would play A and hold Sente.]
;W[rp];B[sq]C[jada:  greedy mistake.  should have been S2
J: Yes :)  S3 leaks a weakness so it is gote.];W[pr];B[or];W[rr]
;B[qs];W[rs];B[ps];W[sp]LB[pa:D][md:A][ie:E][af:G][fi:C][ol:B]
[bn:F]C[J: Look for sente plays that strengthen you.  I've marked points that are sente or worth more points than P4.]
;B[op];W[oo];B[bn]LB[bo:A]TR[aj][bj][ak][bk]C[J: This doesn't help you too much.  It's gote and it leaves a strong white stone on the second line, which will be able to attack your shape on the top.  Play A instead.]
;W[bm];B[bp]
(;W[bk]C[J: White get's his profit back.];B[bj]

;W[gi];B[ll]C[jada:  i should have played aji keshi at D11.  or finalized the cut by playing N18.  this move was too small, i think.]
;W[lm];B[jl];W[ol];B[ml];W[oj];B[nk];W[ni];B[mi];W[oh];B[nf]
C[jada:  same thing here.  should not have assumed the K18 group was disconnected.]
;W[oe];B[ng];W[no];B[nd];W[od];B[md];W[pc];B[pe];W[mc]C[jada:  still could have won by disconnecting K18 group by playing at M18.]
(;B[me];W[ed];B[fc];W[fe];B[gc];W[lb]C[jada:  seems like this move won the game.  my group on the left was an endless source of ko threats for emil.  it was a fun ko fight, tho.  lot's of good threats on both sides.]
