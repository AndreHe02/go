C[Hi!
I hope you  can find the defect for me to  correct. Thanks.

My comments are marked by B: or BB:
BB: means: there you can probably learn the most. If you try to learn from the mistakes you made there, and avoid them in the next games, you will be 2 stones stronger.

1.) You seem to play to much for secure territory. In some games it is better to build moyos. This game is a typical example. You started building a big black moyo on the upper side. But then you wasted it by playing for only a little territory on the upper side. That allowed white to build a huge moyo in the center.  But white also didnt know what to do with his moyo. white forced you into his moyo and destroyed in this way his own moyo.
It is not easy to play the moyo strategy correctly. Maybe you should at least try to build a moyo in the next game whih is suitable. Maybe (like white here) at the end you will not have much of your moyo and you will loose. Then send that game to the Go teaching ladder (or directly to me) and ask especially: "Please Reviewer, tell me how I could have used my moyo."
2) There are the "thank you moves". If you have a forcing move, look first if the exchange (your forcing move - oponents answer) is good for you. If you force your oponent to make a move which is good for the oponent anyway, then dont do that move (unless it is absolutely necessary for your own defense, but even then you should feel that you are helping your oponent)
3) In the game white started to get a touch down on the upper side. Splitting your territory there into two unrelated territories. If he would have carried that through, you would certainly have lost.
Strangely he suddenly made a move like passing (O18 was equivalent to passing) and you took the chance to connect.
4) You have a certain weakness in your endgame. Try to avoid small moves early in the endgame. Playing small moves to early, one can easily throw away 10 to 20 points in the endgame. This game was decided in the endgame.  But both of you made many mistakes. You made less then your oponent, so you won. Congratulation!

5): Please: Next time you send a game send a game were you lost. Believe us (me and the people from the Go Teaching ladder) that you learn more form games were you lost.
See this game for example: You won by 1.5 points against a stronger oponent. You can be proud of yourself! You did it!
And now, I come along and say: "see here was a mistake and there was a mistake". You might think: "Hey what do you want, my game was not so bad as you make it! Remember I won!" And that way you will not learn so much.
But of course you know: It is always a question of the perspective. If a professional player would look at a game from me he would find many mistakes, even if I won.]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dd];W[cp];B[fq]C[how about the approaching move?
B: This is ok as an approach move. 
F3 and E3 are similar good. But 
here R15 is far better. 
Reason: A) An approach move at 
R15 by white is rather good (as it got support from Q4)
B) The direction of your corner enclosure Q17/R15 would be to the left.
This fits well together with your stone D16.
C) after that white might want to make a corner enclosure at E3 but that corner enclosure faces into the wrong direction.
It faces your D16];W[dm];B[dq]C[B: Not good. Your stones become 
overconcentrated. J4 is better.];W[cq];B[dp];W[do];B[cr];W[br]
;B[co]C[B: This cut is not good. W should play B5 and you gain little. Better: directly E5.]
;W[dn]C[B: This is very risky. How would white
answer Black B5? White would have to answer B4 and the black stones remain a thorn. Otherwise... see variation.]

(;B[dr]C[B: B5 is better. Another thing: Maybe now you see that F3 is to close to your stones D2-D4. That shows that your move D3 was not so good.]
;W[bo];B[iq]C[B: You needed to many move to get a position on the lower side. Also white 
got to much territory in the lower left corner.];W[lq]C[B: Should be at Q15 or R15 (or R14 if you want).]
;B[qq]C[B: seems to early for me. 
Still: R15 or Q15 is the biggest point.];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[pr]
;W[or];B[qr];W[nq];B[ro];W[qn];B[qe]C[BB: Normally black should push once more with S6. If you play like that, white can play S6 in sente and keep you very small and the corner stones dont have any influence on the outside anymore.
Otherwise (better after the exchange S7-R7) R15 is an excellent move.]
;W[rn];B[sp];W[cf];B[ci]C[BB: wrong direction. you should build your moyo at the top with E14. White should now play E14. black must answer F16 and white should attack the lone white stone with C9. That would be very bad for black.]
;W[bd]C[B: wrong direction as well.];B[cl];W[cm]C[B. wrong shape. white should play B7. this would also keep more pressure on the two black stones.]
;B[bg];W[bf];B[cg];W[dc];B[cc]C[BB: Not good. white will certainly answer C16 which is a good move for white: he gets the ideal bamboo connection and can look forward to give atari to D16. This type of move is called "thank you-move": you are helping your oponent to make a good move.]
;W[cd];B[ec];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[df];W[de];B[ed];W[ee];B[fe]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[ff]C[This is now a thank you move by white. It forces black to make the nice move G15 which defends against the weakness at F16.]
;B[ge];W[bl];B[ck];W[bk];B[bj];W[lm];B[jd]TR[pi]C[maybe the marked spot is bigger than the present move

BB: That is right. You have a nice moyo at the upper part of the board. It is wrong to use that moyo for making territory (e.g. on the forth line). You should rather extend your moyo (at Q11) and at the same time hinder whites development there. Then white will be nearly forced to invade your moyo. But you are strong on the left and on the right. you will attack that invading stone getting profit and influence.]
;W[qh]C[B: good move.];B[mc]C[BB: again to low. You are looking for safe territory. Play P15 instead. In such a case you have to build a moyo not a small territory at the edge.]
;W[me]C[B: white is to greedy. something like O13 is better.]
;B[nd]C[i want to protect the cornor.
BB: The corner is very strong and doesnt need protection. It would be better to attack white with O13. This is to timid. when you are strong (and you are strong!) it is the right time to attack. 
It seems to me you are looking to much for safety and territory and not for attacking possibilities.]
;W[ne];B[oe];W[of];B[nf]C[the serious cut !!
B: white should catch that stone in a ladder with O13. If black Q14 then white P13. This cut does not work.]
;W[og]C[B: wrong. white should capture the black stone in a ladder.]
;B[mj]C[how about the move?
B: after whites mistake you should defend your cutting stone by playing N13. After that the two white stones on O15/N15 are easy target for attack.
This black N10 is a little far from all its allies.];W[mg]C[B: Good.]
;B[mn]C[B: Now the black stone at N10 will become even weaker.]
;W[mm];B[ln];W[kn];B[ko];W[jn];B[jo];W[lo];B[lp];W[mo];B[mp]
;W[nn];B[mq]C[B: This result is not good for black. black got a little profit on the lower side. but white is so strong now in the center. whites right side moyo could all become territory right to the middle of the board.]
;W[mr];B[kq];W[lr]C[B: defending that stone is to small. white should play K11 or so. After K11 white has an enormous lead.]
;B[jj];W[md];B[od]C[B: No! Defend at O17. If you defend at O17 the upper side is yours. (white cannot play M17 after that because of black M16. white cannot catch M16 as black M15 would be atari. If you play O17 the cut at P16 is also defended: white cannot play there. The white Atari at Q15 (which you might be afraid of) is small.]
;W[lc];B[kc]C[B: I would still play black M16 here. But it is hard to see what will happen then. Now white gets the "touch down". I mean he will get to touch the upper side in the middle of your former prospective territory. This is very expensive.]
;W[ld];B[gf];W[fh];B[gh];W[fj];B[fg]C[B: Another thank-you-move. white is happy to defend at E13 and E12. After that there is no weakness left.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[gg]C[B: Oh I see, that was the idea. unfortunately it doesnt work..]
;B[ei];W[fi]C[B: white H13 is better. in any case: a bad result for black.]
;B[hg];W[fg];B[hh];W[ii];B[kh];W[jf]C[B: not good.];B[ih]C[B: K13 is correct form. K13 connects your center stones and attacks K14]
;W[ji];B[jh];W[ki]C[B: white is destroying his own moyo by pushing you into it. eg. M11 is better.
If black M12 then N11 and the moyo stays intact.];B[lh];W[li]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[nh]C[B: very silly by white.];W[ng];B[ni]C[B: Ouch! Good bye white moyo.]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[nk];B[qi];W[ph];B[pi];W[qf];B[rf];W[rg];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[re];W[ri];B[ok];W[nl];B[rj];W[sh];B[in];W[im];B[hn]
;W[hm];B[mb];W[lb];B[kb];W[nb]C[B: Another silly move. white is throwing  away his lead. E.g. After white M19 black cannot defend both sides.]
;B[la]C[B: Good! Now you got a chance to win again!];W[ie];B[id]
;W[he];B[hd];W[je];B[hf];W[kd];B[jc];W[lg]C[B: far to small! White J1 is far bigger and sente. white G6 is also bigger.]
;B[gm];W[gl];B[fo];W[gn];B[go];W[fn];B[en];W[fm];B[eo]C[BB: This is not so big. You are just defending one stone. Look for big endgame moves. B1 is big and white might even answer. L1 is very big. otherwise white will play J1 in sente imediately. R8 is big.]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[ek];B[ej];W[ma];B[na];W[nc];B[ma];W[qc];B[qb]
;W[rb];B[rc];W[pb];B[qd]C[B: all this was whites nonsense. But of course it didnt cost white anything (apart from Ko threats)]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[qk];B[ol];W[qj];B[om];W[on];B[nm];W[ml];B[hi]
;W[hj];B[ij];W[lj];B[gj];W[hk]C[B: Good maneuvre your are playing here! But I think you are still behind.]
;B[fk];W[el];B[ce];W[be];B[gi];W[ce];B[ak];W[bm];B[af]C[B: Again a small move. Now white should play J1 and probably still win the game.]
;W[bc]C[B: Not necessary.];B[ae];W[al]C[B: small];B[aj]C[BB: No! Dont answer every move.
Answering every move is a sure way to loose in the endgame against a stronger oponent. If the white follow up move is not so big, then tenuki! Look for big moves elsewere. L1 is big. B1 is big. Also Q8 is not so bad and probaly sente.]
;W[gk]C[B: so small. with capturing your stone on C17 white wanted to make live in the corner secure. with this move white makes the connection. But white does not need both! This is uneffective.]
;B[kr]C[B: Good! Now you got a good chance to win. L1 would have been slightly larger.]
;W[np];B[kp];W[pm]C[B: White should finish up the sequence below with L1 which is sente. and E19 which is sente before making this move]
;B[ql]C[B: Good idea. Only to late. After whites last move this doesnt work anymore.]
;W[pl];B[pk];W[rk];B[bq];W[bp];B[bs];W[ar];B[da]C[B: Very good! This hurts white! white had plenty of oportunity to play E19  sente.]
;W[ca];B[ea];W[kg]C[B: White L1 is bigger.];B[jg];W[if]C[B: The smallest move so far.]
;B[ad];W[ac];B[ag];W[pj]C[B: This now is a zero point move.]
;B[ls]C[B: Yes! Big];W[ms];B[ks];W[sn]C[B. Yes! Big];B[sq];W[so]
;B[rp];W[ps];B[rr];W[qs];B[rs];W[os];B[cs]C[BB: No! Avoid those moves. It is exactly like passing. T14 brings an extra point. Be careful at the very end. especially in a close game like this one. Take your time.]
;W[aq]C[B. *sigh* White does the same mitake.];B[as];W[sf];B[se]
