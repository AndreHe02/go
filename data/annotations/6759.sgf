C[Hello, and thanks for reviewing my game. I lost and I need your help to find out why.  I played black.  Also, how would you rank my playing skill based on your opinion.  I asked alot of strong players and they said that i don't put up a fight,so can you help me with that? Thanks again!

Hello!  I hope you enjoy this review and find it helpful.  If you have any follow up questions please email me or contact me on kgs (MilkHotel is my user id)]

Otacon [8k?\]: hi];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[cf]C[should it have been safer to approach at f17 or f16?

C14 is a good move, very common.  F17 is also a reasonable choice.  F16 is a little bit unsual in this situation.  So I would stick to F17 or C14]

Yes c11 is better.  Misclicks happen to the best of us =).  TIll this result is not a disaster, very playable for black.]

However, It is a little bit too early to attack .  It is preferable to continue with the opening and wait for an ideal time to attack.  For example, if black got thick in the center his attack at B would be much more severe.]

White's split white and attack =) (exactly what you did)]

;W[pm];B[ol];W[pl];B[ok];W[jc]C[i started to invade at h17 but i was scared

H17 is possible but its too early now.  A good strategy would be to continue attackign m5 group.  You probably won't be able to kill it but instead you could stear the attacin in such a way that you get some thickness in the center.  Then it becomes much easier to do h17 invasion if you want to.

I think on the whole black played well.  Played failed to use the attack on the the m5 group to gain a whole board advantage.  Also black made several moves that hurt black but helped white. Particularly the early invasion at R12 and the Move at M17.  On the whole black played well and is on a good path so keep practicing and keep a good attitude and you will surely improve!

Hope my comments are helpful!])
