I've chosen one of my early games where I lost.

Hi, I am Jouni, 6k FI.  I think in your review it is good that you take just a couple of points - those you feel are most important and study them instead of overwhelming the other with your variations.

I think, though, that when you tell that a variation is better than another, it would be good if you can tell why.  Then it would be easier for the reader to apply in the later games. 

I hope my comments will be useful.];B[dc];W[pp];B[qd];W[cp]

(;W[dq]LB[dm:A]C[W defending corner and allow to enclose themself.

kex: Why did white choose to let black enclose?

* Often it is better to not to be enclosed.  

* Also, playing at A would split black in two groups, and it would make possible to attack to one of them.

Is there some specific reason for this choice?];B[em];W[od]
;B[qf]LB[lc:A][ld:B][md:C]TR[dc]C[Seem it's B mistake - better to play pincher at A-C.

kex:  Why?  My guess would be because of the marked corner stone, trying to build a framework on the upper side.  In a review, it would be good to give the reasoning, so that the weaker player learns.  (In some other situation, pincer could be worse than extending on the side)]
;W[pc]C[And for W M16 also looks better

kex:  How would black punish this then?]
(;B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[kc]C[Taking corner with wR18 is good, but shape has a wakness at Q18 - now, I think, it isn't such important, but will be in future.

kex:  True - and white got a pretty stable position on the upper side - which you can explain to be the reason why originally a pincer would have been better.]
;B[ic]LB[mc:A]C[bJ17 too far, better D14 at first

kex: again - if J17 is an overplay, you can show it by an example sequence.  The benefit of J17 is that it prepares for an invasion somewhere around A while extending from the corner.  See also variations.  (I am not so strong either, so take them with a grain of salt, but I hope you get an idea of how you can try to give some food for thought in a review)]
