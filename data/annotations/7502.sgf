C[Hello, and thank you for reviewing my game!  This was an even game (6.5 komi) between me and a kgs 2k. I took black (wren).
This was my first even game in almost a year.  I feel I really took control for a lot of the game and could easily play at 1-2k as I get back into things, but have some gaping holes in my play still that need to be worked on.  We were a bit chatty, I will try and leave my comments above the conversation in a sepereate section to keep it clear.]
;B[pd]C[wren [3k?\]: hello
Hylebos [2k\]: Have a good game and good luck with the rank :)]
;W[dp]C[wren [3k?\]: have a good game
wren [3k?\]: thanks!];B[cd];W[pp];B[ic]C[I like the chinese opening, it makes me feel solid with a lot of potential for expansion.]
;W[qf];B[pf]C[____
Reviewer: This move might be rushing it a bit, this move is not really wrong, but i feels it contradicts a bit the low chinese. It gives you and your opponent a strong position, while the low chinese opening is more terretorialy oriented, and whites two starpoint stones gives him an influence oriented game.]
;W[pe]LB[oe:A][qe:B]C[This surprised me.  Maybe it is a lesser known joseki variation, but I felt I got the upper hand from the resulting sequence.

___
wren [3k?\]: hm
Hylebos [2k\]: Yup.
Hylebos [2k\]: I'm pretty sure this will work.
wren [3k?\]: ok
wren [3k?\]: it isn't joseki, but it is interesting
___
Review:
This is a borderline trickplay, given that white has the ladder. If white doesnt have it, it is disaster for white, you should come out of this ahead.
A is correct
B is the ladder does not work for white];B[oe];W[qe]
(;B[of]C[At this point I already feel like I will have a significant advantage due to my outward influence, even if I lose the corner.  However, looking back, This sin't much better than the normal joseki, and I end up losing the corner.

___
Hylebos [2k\]: I thought it was.  =(];W[qd]C[Considered hane here, but felt I shoudl just play it safe.]

(;B[pc]C[wren [3k?\]: hehe];W[pg]
(;B[nq]LB[cn:A]C[Looking back, something around d10 seems stronger, as it puts my influence to good use.  I hate dealing with an oponent's strong area of control, though, so I tend to jump in early.

___
Reviewer: Personally i would play at A, in order to try and get huge influence on the left. But this is not wrong.]
;W[kq]
(;B[qn]C[This was pretty much on impulse.  not sure if I like it.  I think i was considering attacking the top stones, but this seems silly now, they are very thick.

____
Reviewer: This move works in a way, might want to play a high move or just go in at 3,3 point. Whites move is quite bad, and regarded as nonstandard]
;W[pn]
(;B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[pm]C[White gets awesome influence.  This is just silly.

___
Reviewer: That is why you play the hane];B[qm];W[qo];B[ro];W[po]
;B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq]C[At least I get sente to counter act the wall I just built him.]
;B[dj]C[Finally, where I should have started...

____
Reviewer: Good move];W[ps]C[meh..

____
Reviewer:
Bad move];B[ql];W[pl];B[qk]C[Sure, I'll take a bit more territory and threaten your stones...

____
R: This push and crawl favours you in a way, because white answers, he can tenki without worries because your corner is open]

(;W[qi];B[cn]LB[jo:A]C[Now I'm feeling good.  Whites wall is huge, but I got the approach and th ehigh start at d10, so I'm feeling good about my prospects.  I don't know why I always undervalue my opponent's influence and overvalue mine, but this felt dominant to me.

______
R: You are ahead, but also think about different mesures of reducing white such as A.]
;W[dg]
(;B[ch]C[perhaps a bit conservative... Maybe Black should press down a bit because of the c16 stone on the third line preventing w from entering the corner, then launch an attack on the thin ness around g3?

_____
R: This is a bit direct, and i feel it strengthens your opponent, you should attack him while taking terretory]
;W[ee];B[ec];W[fc]C[This exchange turns out poorly...];B[ed]
;W[fd];B[fe]C[I'm not sure why I decided to give up the corner... I think I ready something else.]

(;B[ge];W[dd];B[dc];W[cc];B[cb];W[bc]
(;B[bd];W[bb];B[fb];W[be]C[For some reason I wasn't thinking about those two stones.  Bad result.]

(;B[ip]C[wierd placement, a little cose to w's wall and too far away from d4 to attack it.


____
R: Yes double approach is a good move, is a good reduction move, but lacks a bit of force]
;W[go]C[w gets to come calmly into the center.];B[gq]LB[kp:A]
C[I decide to dig in.

____
R: Quite complicated, but it works. Attach at A might work aswell, as it strethens your group, white is more than strong enough with his wall, he does not gain much here.]
;W[jo];B[cq]C[Quite risky What if white play  the other side?]

(;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq];W[fp]C[You are safe and winnning]

(;B[em]LB[io:A]C[Feeling great here.  W's d4 wall is all but useless.  He has a lot of power building in the center, but my top side is bigger, and I've got more territory on his half of the board as well.  Of course, I didn't see how rough it could get for my bottom left group.

How should black continue  most simply from here to clinch the win?
How should white fight his way back into it?
__________
R:
Playing low is better, safer. You are winning no need to take risks, but als see the potential of this move leaving tyhe cut at A a possibility

White has to make a daring invasion of the top if he wishes to keep himself in the game,]

;B[er];W[bo];B[io]
(;W[jn];B[in];W[gm];B[bn]TR[jr]C[This is a bit cowardly, this group is safe enough and white has managed to get a base, get your other group out. The marked space gives you life if you are worried]
;W[il]LB[lk:B][jr:A]C[W gets the best of the last 20 moves or so for sure.  B's group is in trouble, and w's influence is spreading...
-----
R: This is too sente, white can capture the three stones. You can play B and se how he responds, the probe you play makes your stone really weak and heavy right away, It does not give you much potential for further reduction]

Thanks again for reviewing, and good luck in your games!

_________
R: You played a good game, where you got a good strong position, some misjugements cost you a lot of points in the midgame, but you came into the endgame with a 10 point lead, sadly you managed to lose it...
Count more often and if you are ahead dont take any chances
