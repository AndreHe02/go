*** DimitriLW ***
Game reviewed by DimitriLW (8k IGS).  Please note that I am only an 8k; therefore, take everything I say with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Prior to comments, I will use "*** DimitriLW ***" as a marker.  I generally use SGF Annotations features to "rate" individual moves; when I do, I will mark the rated stone with an X to alert viewers that it has associated Annotations.  Also, when appropriate I will mix in some typed commentary.

I wish to thank Wintersun for the opportunity to review this game.  Note that while I am reviewing for white (W), I will often include comments about black (B) moves.  Hopefully these will help W see their own holes and also see holes in B's play.  One of the keys to growing stronger is to learn to think like the opponent....

Having looked through the game, it appears that Wintersun was often uncertain of where to fight and how.  Therefore, I encourage Wintersun to consider joining GoProblems.com (free) and working through a few problems each day.  Start with the 15k-and-under problems until all are completed.  Then, increase the difficulty level until all of those problems are complete.  Rinse and repeat.

However, my single strongest recommendation is to remain engaged in the go-playing community: continue to play the game; read reviewed games; review the games of others and your own games; and submit your own games for review by others (such as this game) after you review it yourself and remain uncertain why a game was lost.

If you stay engaged in the game, not only will your play improve, so will your love of the game.

Respectfully,

Somewhat non-traditional placement.  This type of fuseki play is certainly outside of my expertise.  However, I would consider it risky, especially for lowe-rank players like us.]

Ambitious, but possible.  Personally, I think B could reduce W's top with something easier, like O18.

...or, B could take this sente opportunity to move somewhere completely different.  A stone in the general vicinity of W's weak two stones could result in opportunity for B while simultaneously giving a base from which to push into the center and reduce W's area]

[ci][dh][di][ph][pl][qg]C[*** DimitriLW ***
Right now, it appears that B has solid life.  Perhaps this stone would be more useful elsewhere.  Some general possibilities are marked.]
BM[1];B[ga];W[fb];B[hb];W[hd];B[id];W[ge]C[*** DimitriLW ***
Weak.  H15 works.  If B cuts at G16, just push him back into your D16 group.  ...or, if you are concerned about the cut, then consider playing G16 immediately.  After all, after B plays H15, you will play G16 anyway.  

Imagine this: if you played G16, then B played H15, would you play G15 next or something else?  This thinking shows how small G15 is in comparison to other areas (previously marked).

...essentially, what this stone says is "please play H15, it is a free play fo you.]
DO[];B[he];W[gd];B[if]DO[];W[hf];B[ie];W[gi]C[*** DimitriLW ***
This feels like a reach, which could allow B to develop some cuts in the future and/or build life underneath it by threatening cuts from the inside.]

W appears to concede the marked region for now instead of fighting for it.  What will happen first: W closing in the points with a stone at B8, or B destroying them for good..?]

From my last comment up to now, the exchange just seems slow.]
;W[oc];B[lo];W[ln];B[lp]DO[];W[jn];B[jo];W[in]C[*** DimitriLW ***
At this point, B needs to notice that the center is nearly enclosed.  It is critical that B get feelers probing into that area, such as via using the top group to stretch into the center and destroy W's territory.]

This will not secure the center.  I am uncertain what the goal of this stone is, but the result is much like passing.]

I believe E1 works.  But I can understand the desire to simply play safe.  After all, W appears to be sizably ahead right now.]

No.  B should still die, but this would be better at B12 to push B into your wall.]
;B[bh];W[ch];B[cg];W[bg]C[*** DimitriLW ***
No.  W is trying to give life to B.  If you want to kill the eye space, then play B14 instead.  This stone will be captured by a B stone at B14.]
BM[1];B[bf];W[dg];B[cf];W[df];B[ag];W[ce]MA[ai]C[*** DimitriLW ***
Oops.  Final mistake of the game.  W just allowed B to make two eyes, thus turning a dead group into a living one, and giving the game to B.
