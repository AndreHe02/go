;W[jp]C[al> This is not so good for white, I think. It is not catastrophic, but you have to be a stronger player to be able to make territory from a move like K4. Black can easily sabotage white's chance to get territory at the bottom by playing H3 or K3, for instance.

al> As a beginner, it is recommended to stay close to the borders and play no higher than the third line during the first 30 moves, or so. That will create a base for stepping further into the board later in the game. Compare with black's R5, which will most likely secure the corner, and some ten points of territory, at least. Since K5 is on the line above the black stone at Q3, it seems to indicate that white is going for the center, where it is much harder to secure territory.]
;B[pj];W[jj]C[al> K10 is even bolder, but as it turns out, it ends up being fairly well placed later, since black played into white's hands (almost). However, you hardly ever see anyone play here this early in a game.

al> Note: It is important to rememeber that noone can say that a move (like this) is "right" or "wrong". There are, in some situations, "correct" moves, but that is rather a notion of what, experience wise, is considered "good shape", or the most economic way to play, or possibly the only way to make a group survive, and things like that. So don't let proverbs and advice from others curb your imagination - you will learn soon enough what kind of moves you will get punished for :)]
;B[mc];W[ic]C[al> This is a reasonable answer to black N17. Thanks to the white stone in the middle of the board, the white J17 stone is not as lonely as it would have been otherwise, and it is harder for black to split the white stones by playing F17 or G17. If he does, white has the time to secure the corner before running with the J17 stone towards K10, squeezing the black group in the process.]
;B[dj]C[al> This was expected, since white has left the side wide open.]
;W[di]C[al> Since white has stones in the center, it would be better to try to push black out between the white stones by undercutting him at c12 or c8, for instance.

al> If you want to kill a group, attack it from some distance - contact play like this tends to strengthen the attacked group instead, and makes it easier for the opponent to counter attack.]
;B[co];W[do]C[al> White D5 is good. It threatens to put a wedge between the black C5 and D10 stones, and also makes use of the white K4 stone to begin to go for territory around G3.]
;B[dl];W[el];B[dn];W[eo];B[cg];W[eh];B[cc];W[fc]C[al> F17 could be at D17 to put pressure on black and try to not lose unnecessary points outside the corner. It would be hard enough for black to attempt to invade here.]
;B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[cf]C[--- did I let him get too strong in the sides and such right off the bat?

al> Not necessarily. Black has by now got some pretty likely territory in the upper left and lower right corner. But white still has the chance to get good points along the bottom, and it is also possible to invade blacks domain at the right side.

al> Also, in exchange for letting black build a solid wall in the upper left, white got a wall of his own, facing in the opposite direction. The white wall may yield points around f15, and by playing e10, there is a good chance that white can extend the territory downwards. White seems pretty consistent in trying to make territory in the center of the board. I especially like the E12 stone; at this point, it is very well placed.

al> The black stones along the lower left side are still a good target for attack. Not so much for to actually kill it, but rather to be able to build good walls at the same time.]
;W[ch]C[al> Splitting the black groups is a good idea. C12 has the disadvantage that black may threaten to cut it off by pushing at D13, following up with D12 - unless white gives up his moyo around F14. In the latter case, that would require white to kill the lower black group to compensate.]
;B[ci];W[bi]C[al> Things are getting complicated here. Black can play D13 and threaten to dart out into white's upper left middle moyo, but on the other hand, letting black connect his groups would make it pointless to attack the lower one.

al> I think maybe the best would be to stay consistent and play E10, followed by E9, to keep extending the wall. If black slips out around E6 it will only help white building territory at the bottom. The downside of that approach is that black gets almost the whole left side, so it becomes even more crucial to not allow black in from the right, reducing white's potential territory in the center. A successful invasion along the right side is probably also a must for white in order to win.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[ck];W[cl]C[al> This was white's las chance to play E10.]
;B[ek]C[al> Now the worms are out of the can. Black can reduce white's potential in the center, and the black groups are alive and well (or will be)

al> Note that the c8 and e8 stones are now just leverage for black to live and extend out in the board. This is what contact play does for you; you think you are chasing a group, and suddenly, it is your own stones that are vulnerable.]
;W[ej]C[al> By now, F12 would work better for fending off black from the upper left middle. Contact play is for trying to survive in a tight spot - it doesn't work well when trying to stop an intruison like this. It is better to keep a distance, winning time enough to get some stones in place before the attacker gets there. You give up some points in order not to lose even more, so to speak.]
;B[em]C[al> Black does not seem too keen on destroying potential for white, so it would now be possible to play F9 to seal him off.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[gm];B[lp]C[al> No black stones are in any immediate danger, so he can afford to play elsewhere.]
;W[mo];B[kn];W[ln];B[lo];W[mp];B[mn];W[lm];B[nn];W[ko];B[km]
C[al> black should probably have extended the M4 group instead, to get a huge corner.]
;W[lq];B[ll];W[mm];B[nm];W[kp]C[al> Well, that took care of the black stab into the bottom of the board. White should be able to get a fair share of territory there.

al> Actually, since the ladder won't work, it could be interesting to take it one more step (to N8). If black answers at N9 he will have a group with weaknesses that white can attack in order to create a moyo in the center. If black does not, the group can be cut off by white N9, and maybe killed.

al> Of course, for building territory in the center it is crucial to keep black out of it, so F9 is definitely still urgent. Also important is a play around L16 to keep black from coming in from the right. However, that is a little tricky, because it could end with black having an equal moyo in the upper right, including the corner. I am thinking that an invasion on the right side would be needed first, to be able to extend the white moyo towards the right side with some force.]
;B[ml];W[lo];B[lj];W[li];B[kd];W[jc]C[al> This leaves the door wide open for black to reach into potential territory in the upper left middle - while building a moyo of his own, no less. K15 would have been better as a stopper.]
;B[jf];W[if];B[jh];W[ih];B[lg];W[lh];B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[fp]
;B[go];W[ho]C[al> White G4 would have prevented black from digging too deep into the bottom white area.]
;B[gk];W[fk];B[dk];W[bj]C[al> White G8 would prevent the double atari coming up, at the same time strengthening the G6 group.]
;B[fj];W[ei]C[--- sacrificed the wrong stones?

al> Well, there is precious little left of the upper left middle moyo, so it would perhaps be better to see how you can reduce black's territory instead of defending your own.

al> When you are leading, you should try to expand your territory, but when you are behind, you gain more from reducing the opponents territory by destroying potential.]
;B[gl]C[al> For instance, K11 might be interesting to try. If white can connect the M12 group with the other stones, chances are that it will be possible to probe fairly deep down into black's upper right. G4 and C4 are moves that would save some points for white as well. Of those two, C4 is the most urgent for black to answer.]
;W[hn];B[bk];W[gj]C[al> White G11 would be better for keeping black from coming into the white moyo.]
;B[gi];W[hj];B[fi];W[hi];B[fh];W[fg];B[bh];W[dh];B[ai];W[gh]
;B[fk];W[nl]C[al> It is more urgent to strengthen the white F13 stone, by G13, for instance.]
;B[eg];W[dg];B[gg];W[ef];B[hh];W[hg]C[--- the game is already lost... ?

al> More or less. Like I said, it is hard to make points in the center. But white still has potential at the bottom, and black's right is still possible to invade, so the game is closer than you might have felt at the time.]
;B[gh];W[mj]C[al> White G14 at this point would have made white's game easier, although that would have given black time to play elsewhere. Timing is always important.]
;B[ff];W[eg]C[al> filling the ko does not accomplish much. Even if black captures the F13 stone, it doesn't make much difference compared to what happens next. White G13 instead, would have forced black to capture, and then white F15 would have stopped him.]
;B[hf];W[jg]C[al> White J13 here would have kept the stones connected, which is good if black plays something like J8 to cut off the middle stones from below.]

(;B[qb]C[vang [15k?\]: misclick])
(;B[ed];W[lk]C[vang [15k?\]: this is a big mistake, i think

--- was this a big mistake? it seemed to me that there is nothing I could do for the D16 group...

al> White E17 is one possible way of connecting the D16 group to the stones at the top, which should be able to find life along the border. F15, followed by E17 might work even better.]
;B[dc];W[kj];B[gp];W[hp];B[gq];W[kl];B[ol];W[mk];B[nk];W[ml]
;B[nj];W[ni];B[og];W[lf]C[al> White N13 would have made it possible to push deeper into black's area, destroying point for him.]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[ng];W[ok];B[oj];W[pk];B[pl];W[qk];B[qj];W[ql]
;B[qm];W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[no];W[np]C[al> By O4, white is sealing the fate of the P6 group. Chasing the black stones with P5 and onwards would have worked to capture them, while at the same time threatening the corner.]
;B[oo];W[po];B[pn]C[--- I had him totally in my control! how did this happen!? if the game was not already lost it is lost now, no?

al> Yes, I would say it is lost. But to claim that you had him in control is an overstatement, I am afraid. Don't play at contact with your opponent's stones all the time - remember that your stones are only connected along the lines, not diagonally.]
;W[pp];B[op];W[qp];B[rp];W[jm]C[vang [15k?\]: k7 is completely usseless. don't give up]
;B[kb]C[funduk [?\]: what would be more useful?];W[kc]C[vang [15k?\]: anithing else. l6 is already dead]
;B[lc]C[funduk [?\]: but the h4 group has nothing to work with, your large groups plus l6 couldn't be threatening?

al> White C4 would save the H4 group, and a fair chunk of points in the corner.]
;W[je]C[vang [15k?\]: don't see how. anyway... it wads just an oppinion.]
;B[ke]C[funduk [?\]: ok... i have only been playing for 2-3 weeks, i dont know these things :)]
;W[jd]C[vang [15k?\]: oh, you are playing very strong for this period of time then
funduk [?\]: ??? i thought i was getting slaughtered!
vang [15k?\]: of course. but i'm playing since 15 years now.
funduk [?\]: wow

al> At this point, white would have had to play K18 to be able to save the K17 group. It is not worth it to try to save the K15 stone, since all of them will be captured now.]
;B[ib];W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb]C[--- Should I continue to play in the H17 group? it dies later of course, could i have done something with it?

al> Yes, you need to learn how to make eye space. A group needs two eyes to live. By now, the group has no room to make eyes, so it is not meaningful to play it any more.]

;W[me];B[mf];W[ne];B[oe];W[qq];B[qr];W[rj];B[ri];W[sk];B[rl]
;W[rk];B[sl];W[oq]C[--- is this type of 'threat' useful? or should I have been concentrating more on defense at this point rather than any form of attack? especially since i know what his response to P3 is going to be..,

al> I think it shows that stones that are still on the board can prove useful, even if they are destined to be captured. Without the soon-to-be-captured R3 group, black could have answered white P3 with O3.]
;B[rq];W[mh]C[al> White saved one point at N11 but will lose several points if black plays O3. It would have been better to have followed up with white P2 first. Also, the lower left group is worth even more points, so C4 is even more urgent than P2.]
;B[hk];W[ik];B[il];W[im];B[in];W[jn]C[funduk [?\]: should have played at j5...

al> It was not necessary to capture the black stones at this point. In fact, white should have played C4.]
;B[hq];W[iq];B[ep];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[es];B[gr];W[fs]
;B[gs];W[ds]C[vang [15k?\]: ugh. what a cow i am ;-)

--- was this 'very nice' of black?

al> I think black meant that he should have played D1 instead of G1. But by playing D2, black can still atari the white group.]
;B[en]C[funduk [?\]: hehe];W[dp];B[cp];W[dr]C[vang [15k?\]: i can easily won that but i'm out of cigarettes ;-)

al> Since the black e2 group was in atari, white could have afforded to play c3 instead, gaining some extra points, and adding an eye to the group.]
;B[cq];W[eq]C[funduk [?\]: :)

al> In this situation, e3 is certainly the correct move to make two eyes, and critical for the group to survive.]
;B[cr];W[cn]C[al> Now, it would have been time for white P2. There is nothing to gain inside black's walls on the left.]

;B[cs]C[--- was the ko worth anything? when is a ko worth fighting for?

al> Winning the ko made an eye for white at K1. In this case it meant that white got a point there. Sometimes winning a ko is the only way for a group to survive. If K1 had been the only place for the group to get a second eye, then losing the ko would also have meant losing the group.

al> In close games, where half a point matters, winning a ko might mean winning the game, even though the ko itself may appear to be insignificant.]

thanks for all your help!

al> For someone who has only been playing for a month, I would say this is pretty good. You know about the concept of a ko, and you know how to make a group like E1 survive, and you know enough to look elsewhere on the board from time to time.

al> I think what you generally have to improve is your ability to play lighter, that is, space your stones further apart instead of building them like bricks, one next to another. Playing "heavy" like that makes it harder for your groups to find eye space, and makes for slow progress on the board as a whole. 

al> Oh, and contact play is not a good idea if you want to kill a group, either. Keep a little distance, and try to contain the group just enough for it not to find eye space.

al> That, and to play safer, along the borders, in the beginning, is the things you should work on. I think you will do fine, with more practice. Maybe you should try to play a lot of 9x9 games, to get a good feeling for where a group's eyes have to be.]
