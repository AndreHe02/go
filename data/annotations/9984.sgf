C[B: Hi, I'm Bart and I'll review your game. I'm around 6kyu, so I don't know everything, but can hopefully give you some pointers in the right direction.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df]
(;W[bf]
(;B[dj]C[Roido888: Perhaps F-15 would have been more standard? But I wanted to disrupt white's coordination with the lower stone.

B: white's B14 is more of an endgame move. Normal joseki white plays F17 and you make an extension on the 3rd line. See first variation.
B: but because white played B14, you can choose to respond, or build the top part. See variation.]
;W[fe]
(;B[gc]C[B: here I would cut white at E16.];W[fc]C[B: now white reinforces and made F15 into a good move.]
;B[gd];W[fd];B[fb]C[B: usually, its better to make a base first, e.g. K17. After that, you can always decide to play F18 later on.]
;W[eb];B[ff]CR[gd]LB[kc:B][cn:A]C[B: this leaves a cut between the circled stones. Better extend one of your groups, around A or B.]
;W[cg];B[dg];W[dd];B[ge]C[Roido888: Trying to build strength on the left side.

B: good. It closes that gap.];W[ef];B[eg];W[ee];B[gg];W[ch]

(;B[dn]C[B: good direction. I would prefer one line lower. That way it also looks towards the corner. See variations.]
;W[cl];B[dl]C[Roido888: Again trying using the upper formation to support this.]
;W[cn];B[ck]C[B: good];W[cm];B[dm];W[do]
(;B[cq]C[Roido888: perhaps not the best movw now that white has strength on the left side. I dont know the sequence to live. Aim is to create same distraction for white. Perhaps unnecessray and a more peaceful move would habe been better?

B: see variaton from move 39. Peaceful move like F5 is also possible.]
;W[dq]C[B: with this move, white allows you into the corner but gets strong to the bottom right]
;B[dr]
(;W[cr]C[B: not expected];B[br];W[cs];B[ds];W[bq]
(;B[bs]C[B: or extend C3, see variation.];W[cp]
(;B[fo]C[Roido888: I abandon the lower formation, as I think the middle is bigger. I think it still has some aji for later.

B: the middle takes 4 sides to defend, the corner only 2 and the side 3. So you're right, but it also good to take the profit. See variation.]
;W[cr];B[pj]LB[nc:A][qc:B][kq:E][nq:C][qq:D]C[Roido888: Again, I want to solidify blacks whole board position.

B: these are still influence moves. White can still get a living group anywhere, for instance playing A-E.]
;W[er]C[Roido888: White seems very focused on this corner, which I have abandoned.

B: it's taking profit over influence.];B[mq];W[es]C[B: strange move. As white, I would invade somewhere.]
;B[hq]C[B: a bit too loose maybe. I'd prefer K3.];W[jq]C[B: ah, that's what white is thinking as well.]

(;B[ir]C[B: as there is a gap at G4, it's probably better to attack from above, or from the right side.]
;W[jr]
(;B[mo]C[Roido888: Perhaps should have played boshi, but I think this looks strong

B: I'd prefer to attack white from above, or maybe directly. See variation.]
;W[jo];B[kp];W[jp]C[B: this strengthens white, so the gap at G4 becomes interesting.]
;B[ko]C[B: bad move. You push white into your center area.]

(;W[jm];B[jn];W[in];B[kn];W[hm];B[il]C[Roido888: The whole strategy is trying to create strength on the outside while white struggles to make life for his group.

B: which works because white doesnt use its strength. See variation at move 62.]
;W[im];B[kl]
(;W[ho]C[B: missed opportunity by white.];B[fq]C[B: good save, but not a real threat.]
;W[fn];B[en]
(;W[fm]C[B: another missed chance by white.];B[eo]C[B: good]
;W[fk]
(;B[fj]C[B: try to attack from a distance. By attaching to the white stone, you invite white to get stronger, as the normal response would be G9.]
;W[gk];B[hl]C[B: see previous comment.]
(;W[gl]C[B: white should exploit the weaknesses in your position, instead of defending.]
;B[go];W[gn]LB[hj:C][jl:A][km:B]C[Roido888: White alive now? Was there a way to kill this shape? Even so, killing was not the purpose.

B: you were lucky here. White had lots of opportunities to counterattack. weaknesses at A and B, a gap at C, and earlier the gap in the lower left.
It was hard to kill because of these weaknesses in your formation, but by giving white something in the beginning, you could have kept white very small and your own area big. See earlier variations.]
;B[hp];W[io]C[B: no need.];B[kd]C[B: good. Or take the corner with R17.]
;W[pg]SQ[ge][gg][il][kl]C[B: missed chance by white. A high move (4th line) is played when you want to reduce the area and have somewhere to run to. But because the sides all have black stones, white cannot run there. Better would be to invade the corner or side.]
;B[ng]C[Roido888: Again, I believe the purpose of this corner formation is to make strength on the inside of the board? White will struggle to make eye space surrounded by these stones, and I will create thickeness in the process coordinating with the strong position on the rest of the board.

B: yes, possible. O14 would also attack, but helps you more to build on the top (which is easier profit than the center).]
;W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[B: I think R16 is also possible.];W[pf];B[qd];W[qi]
;B[qj];W[pi];B[oi];W[oh]
(;B[ni]C[B: see variation. I think O12 is possible.];W[nh]
(;B[mg]CR[ni]C[B: it leaves a gap between the cicled stones, same as realier in the game.]
;W[mh];B[lg];W[mi]C[Roido888: This strategy is similar to what happened on the lower left side: squeezing white and creating outer thickeness for black.

B: which should not work in this case because I think white should be able to make life.]
;B[re]
(;W[rg];B[qf];W[qg];B[ri]C[Roido888: Perhaps this was a mistake to a stronger player? White could have played around N9 or M9 to create trouble? Or perhaps white would be smarted to connect up with its living group on the lower left hand side?

B: of make life first and then attack your weaknesses, so yes, I think white had possiblilites here. See possible variation at move 104.]
;W[rh];B[qm]C[Roido888: I need to make sure the black group does not come under attack.

B: white can still get the corner :-)];W[og];B[ki]C[B: white can live with S10. See variation.]

(;W[mj];B[nk]C[Roido888: White could have played at L10?

B: only after making life with S10, otherwise it is risky.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[ol]C[B: a short ladder];W[rj]

;W[rn];B[pr];W[qr];B[qs];W[rr];B[sp]C[B: doesnt work. Better try T5. Or play elsewhere and leave it as it is.]
;W[so];B[sq]C[Roido888: Misread this, T2 would have been better?]
;W[sr];B[rs];W[rq];B[js];W[gr];B[an]LB[bk:A]C[B: this shouldnt work. A monkey jump is done when there is a stone at A. See variation.]

;W[mk];B[ml];W[np]C[B: dont know what white wants with this]
;B[nn];W[ss];B[ps];W[lq];B[ea]C[Roido888: This is a stupid mistake. At least it ends in sente, the purpose is to start sealing off the black top of the board.

B: yes, better do that with G18.];W[gb];B[hb]
(;W[fa];B[hj];W[gj];B[hh];W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[mm];W[ln];B[ne]
C[Roido888: Not sure if this is a weakness or the best way to protect, but at least it creates less space at the top side for white to reduce.

B: yes, its good to keep a bit of distance.];W[lj];B[kk];W[kj]
;B[jj];W[jk];B[jl];W[ik];B[hk]C[Roido888: White should play at K11 next?

;B[ep];W[eq];B[sg]C[Roido888: Probably a stupid move. This group looks already alive.

B: yes, see earlier comment.];W[sf];B[sj];W[sk];B[sl];W[sj]
;B[rf];W[sh];B[pm];W[ig];B[ih]C[Roido888: Im sure it was the case way earlier but Game looks over to me from this point. Thank you for your review!

B: you're welcome. You got lucky at times. White could have put up a better fight. Hope I've shown you some pointers. Keep playing.]
