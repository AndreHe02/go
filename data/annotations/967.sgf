C[White's main issues in this game are attacking from the wrong side and attacking without adequate preparation.You should attack from the side where your own stones are weaker. And you should not give up lots of points to try to kill a big group.  Better to gain points while attacking and let the oppoent's group live.]

;B[nq]C[This tenuki is dangerous.  If black doesn'tfinish the joseki in the lower left, white can start anattack later.In this game, part of why white loses, is that he never attacks these three black stones.]

(;W[jp]
(;B[pr]C[This move is unusual.  Usually black would makea second approach move or jump out.  The second approach move is probably best since black has a stone in the upper right.]

(;W[om]C[Better to attack form the other side, since you are thick on this side.  You should be adding stones on the side where you are weaker.]
;B[pn]C[You should answer this move.  Later it will make the attack on the 3 stones in the lower left more severe.]

;B[qg];W[pg];B[ph];W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[of]C[The solid connection is stronger.  If you connect solidly, it is much more difficult for the one stone to run away.Now that you have a wall, you must find some plan that lets you use it to attack the group in the lower left.]
;B[ni]
(;W[mj]C[Better to attack form the other side.  Your stones above are weaker, and below are stronger.  Usually you should attack from the side where your stones are weaker.]

;W[ke];B[jf];W[je]TR[mj]C[Because of the marked move, black was able to push against the weak white group above.   White had to make several worthless moves to connect, and even gave balck a few extra points on the upper edge.  Black made a few points in the center, and completely neutralized the white wall.  The white center thickness becomes black center thickness.]

(;W[if]C[This move does not seem to attack very strongly or take much territory.  Maybe you can find a better one.]

(;W[fh]C[Maybe holding back a little would be better.];B[ef]

(;W[ff]C[This move is not so big.  better to continue playing in the center, pushing the center group around and preparing your attack on the group in the lower left.]
;B[ei]C[Good.  making lots of potential on the left.]
(;W[gl]C[This move is a little loose.  You don't want to be cut and give black a big edge.  Especially since he left a move off the joseki here.  You should be punishing him for that instead.]

;B[kl];W[hm];B[km];W[in];B[mk];W[nj];B[ln]
(;W[lj]C[Since you have to connect after this cut, you can't hope to kill the center group.   Save it for later.]
;B[kj];W[kk];B[ll];W[kn];B[lm];W[oi];B[jj]C[Now take the chance to attack.  You can still come back and connect here later if you want to save two stones.]

(;W[ik]C[I guess you made this move because you thought it was sente against the center group.  Instead you should be thinking about the left side and the weak black group there.  Trading a lot of secure territory against a chance of killing a big group is dangerous. Better to take the attack that destroys territory and save the center group for later.  If you play elsewhere and black takes two stones, you get two moves elsewhere, which is much bigger than the 2 stone capture.]
;B[el]TR[fi][fh][hh][hg]C[Now black is way ahead on territory as long as the center group can live.  Since the marked stones are so weak, the center group should live.  White should strengthen the weak stones first to get compensation on the edge if black lives in the center.]

(;W[he]C[You must use this move to break into the left side.If you end up cut off you have to find some way to fight.  Once black secures the left side, white is behind.  Before making this move would be a good time to count, since the fight in the center is over.  Seeing that you are behind after this move, you must look hard for something better.]
;B[dh]C[Good.  Now black is way ahead.];W[gf];B[hg];W[go]C[Black is way ahead now, so there is no chance to catch up.]
