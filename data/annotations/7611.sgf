******************************
[GoannaEmu\] Hi Reviewer,

This is the first game I have ever had reviewed and am excited to find the GTL. What a great idea! I hope you have fun reviewing!

This game was played on KGS with 25 mins each and 30 secs byo-yomi and 6.5 komi. Both players 11k on KGS. I am black.  It was maybe the most fun game I have played all month.

I have made a few comments after going through the game again. Most of it is just thinking outloud. 

I have been playing with 2 other friends for years but on the net for only a few months and am slowly improving in rank as I start to play a range of players.

I'm not quite sure how I lost this game though.

I appreciate any review you would like to make however short.
:)
ms- It is my pleasure to do the review. Please take my comments as suggestioins only. I am 5K on KGS and 4K on OGS at the moment. -Mike]

(;B[jq]C[[GoannaEmu\] I really have no idea this early in the game.

ms- I don't think this is the  biggest move. Yilun yang has some great concepts. I highly recommend his book "Fundemental Principles of GO".  Smartgo search did show 5 games out of 45000 that did play this fuseki ... up to this point. In those cases white played R14 or R10 next.]
;W[oq]
(;B[pq]C[ms- I would have pincered here to make K3 stone more useful. by contacting a weak stone, you can make it stronger.]
;W[op];B[qn]TR[dp][op][oq]C[ms- black gets out but K3 is looking lonely...3 against one. This becomes more of an isse later in the game.]
;W[lq]C[ms- white makes a base..which is urgent.]
(;B[fq]TR[lq][op][oq]C[[GoannaEmu\] Is there a better way to handle this corner? F4?
Im having trouble using the rest of the board to decide how to attack. What do my stones on the right side mean for the left side?
ms- black has to do something to help lonely stone... three point extension is always risky because white can split at H3. F$ is interesting alternative joseki. Either eay, ou need to help K3 stone.... so good idea.]
;W[cm]C[ms- white respnds more loosely. this may be capitalized upon later by black, if the opprtunity presents itself. Right now, black group on lowerleft are not settled yet.]
;B[dr]C[ms- I would play here too to settle group.];W[cq]C[ms- normal response.]
(;B[pj]TR[fq][jq][dr][ed][fd][gd][hd][id][jd][kd][ld][md][nd]
[od]SQ[qe][qf][qg][qh][qi][qj][qk][ql][qm]C[ms- still need to worry about weakness at H3.  Marked goup is very low/flat too. I would play to get out first. if looking for biggest open area, the top of the board looks bigger - 11 open spaces beteen stones ( triangles) versus 9 openpoints (squares).]
;W[qf]SQ[pd][pj]C[ms- a target for black.... two against one is good odds for black]
(;B[ph]C[[GoannaEmu\] better to defend the corner right?
ms- I think pincer is good. I would play more severe R12. it also keeps alternating high low ( 3rd line 4th lne ) pattern of stones for black.]

;B[rd]C[ms- I am not familiar with this joseki. I've seen Q17 and R15 more frequently.]
;W[qe];B[rb];W[pc];B[qb];W[od]C[ms- white is building a wall ... seems like mabe getting the upper and here.]
;B[oc];W[pe]
(;B[fc]TR[pb]C[[GoannaEmu\] Correct Tenuki? - I figured the stones in the top right can live - is there a way for white to kill here?
ms- it seems that black lost a lot in this corner sequence. Having a small group that is locked in is not desirable, I think white can seal black in at Q18 the next move.  I personally would not tenuki ... but try to get out]
(;W[nc]C[ms - white contacts weak black stone so black becomes stronger.]
;B[ob]C[ms- good extension];W[hc]CR[ic][jc][kc][lc][mc]C[ms- a 5 point extension is usually ideal extension]
(;B[nd]C[[GoannaEmu\] Is this the right idea? 
When I looked at the board as a whole I felt I needed to start attacking. What are my alternatives?
C17?
ms- the cut is a good idea... punish weakness when you can. F15  locally seems to be OK too.]
;W[mc]
(;B[oe]C[ms- this is an early ko fight invitation.... could be risky if white cuts at O15. Treat O16 more lightly.... don't want weak heavy seperated groups if possible.]
;W[pd];B[nf];W[pb];B[pa];W[rh]C[ms- make a base.];B[rf];W[re]
;B[sc]C[ms- black gets and eye and takes and eye... must be a good move.]
;W[sf];B[rg];W[qg]
(;B[ri];W[of];B[ne]TR[oe][nd][nf]C[[GoannaEmu\] I thought I almost got the whole group, but seemed to end up in trouble myself
ms- nice try .... the marked weak stones are getting heavier.]
;W[og];B[ng];W[oh]C[ms- watch out ... whte is getting stronger.]
;B[ni];W[pg];B[jc]C[ms- nice try to split white and use the group at O16 to O13.]
;W[nb];B[oa]LB[qa:A]C[ms- black has to watch out for ko for life if white plays at R19 at some point.]
(;W[na];B[qa]
(;W[kb]C[ms- I think whte should mabe try defensive M16 instead?]
(;B[ld]C[right direction? What can I do with this big wall in the middle of nowhere. It ends up surrounded very easily.
ms- the heavy group has connection problems... maybe connection at O12 first. Also.... use your thickness. If you want to attack, maybe try to split white at K18?]
;W[jb];B[kc]C[ms - it looks like white may already be connected. Time to fix our weak group maybe... O12?]
;W[ic]C[ms - white got stronger, safer in this sequence. better for black to leave some aji/bad potential to maybe take advantage of later.]
(;B[kd];W[se];B[sd];W[pi];B[md]C[ms- black fixes a connection problem. good.]
;W[lb];B[qi]C[ms- seems small, slow. maybe bigger move to help F17 and/or center group?]
(;W[oi];B[nh];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok]TR[qi][ri][pj][pk]SQ[fc][jc]
[kc][kd][ld][md][nd][ne][nf][ng][nh][ni]C[ms- watch out for making too many weak or heavy groups... try to settle some then attack.]
;B[fe]C[ms- seems OK to get out but allows whtie to split.]
;W[he];B[df]C[ms- nice sealing in move. However, you do need to worry about big group with no eyes yet.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[eb]C[I would seal in at F18 before jumping in. This way if you don't kill it, at least you've sealed group in.  big group with no eyes is more urgent.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[be];B[bf]C[ms- yes seal in.];W[cb];B[de]
;W[bc];B[ck]C[ms - big move.];W[lj]

;W[ko];B[ll]C[[GoannaEmu\] could this be a reasonable move? - this was one played with more hope than thought
