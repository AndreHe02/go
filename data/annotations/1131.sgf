;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[dj]LB[jp:a][cf:b]C[This is unusual, but cannot be said to be wrong.  'a' or 'b' are more common.]
;W[jc]LB[je:a][jd:b]C[Playing low invites a later cap at 'a', which would work well with B's stones to create a central moyo.  If W is going to play here he should play at 'b']
;B[jq]C[The same comment applies here -- better to be played high.]
;W[pn];B[qo]LB[qn:a][pj:b][np:c]C[This is a bad move.  White can play at 'a' and it reverts to the joseki when W plays 'a' first.  This is never good unless B has a pincer in place around 'b'. The reason is that it allows W a perfect extension along the side.  W also has the option to play elsewere. 'c'  is usually considered to be the only response to W8]
;W[qn];B[pj]LB[np:a]C[This is the problem refered to at B9.  On the one hand this pincer in premature because B needs to protect at 'a' first.  On the other hand, if B plays at 'a' then W gets the ideal extension to 11 himself.]
;W[qk]LB[op:a]C[Absolutely wrong. W should strengthen his position at the bottom with 'a' and then attack the single B stgone from above.  This move is very submissive, being a defensive move in a position where W has the upper hand.]
;B[qj];W[pk]LB[oj:a]C[W is now heavy. B 'a' now leaves B strong above, nullifying the 2 W 4-4 pts.]
;B[pf]LB[oj:a][op:b]C[Wrong on 2 counts.  First, it should be on the third line to create a more stable group and threaten to undermine the UR corner.  Second, it is the wrong direction: B should play to keep up the pressure on the W group. 'a' is better, although B still has a weakness at 'b'g]
;W[nd];B[qe]LB[qd:a][qc:b][rc:c]C[Ba, Wb, B17, Wc is joseki]
;W[qd];B[re];W[ok]LB[nq:a][op:b][oq:c][np:d]C[Look a little slow.  W is stable for now and the B group above is not easily attacked, if at all.  B has ignored the LR corner and W should put pressure on it.  'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are all seen in this shape.]
;B[ni]LB[np:a]C[Too slow.  The B group is in no danger and W is hard to attack below.  'a' is essential.]
;W[nq];B[oq]LB[np:a]C[To defensive. 'a' is better];W[no]LB[np:a]
C[Should be at 'a'];B[rn];W[rm];B[sn]C[Pointless. B should just connect after having played B25.  However, because B25 then becomes gote, this is the wrong side.]
;W[sm];B[ro]LB[rp:a]C['a' is better shape.];W[op];B[or]C[Better to connect solidly.]
;W[nr];B[os];W[po];B[qq]C[This sequence was a disaster for B.  W started with a weak group on the outside next to B's original 4-4 point.  The -4- point is supposed to be for influence and W has got suberb thickness fro mthis sequence. B will have trouble making a lot of territoriy in the lower have of the board after this.]
;W[gd]LB[fd:a][cg:b][cf:c]C['a' is better than 36 but extending down the side to 'b' is better still as it prevents B 'c']
;B[gq]LB[cf:a][fp:b]C[Too low and too slow. 'a' is the critical point.  Also, in the LL 'b' is much better shape.  B's stones are 3 adn 5 are palyed high for influence.  This stone, on the 3rd line, contradicts that  intension and leaves B with a very flat shape.]
;W[cp]LB[ch:a]C[Unnecessary.  W is already ahead.  He should be happy that B has played low at B37 and so there is no need to play this invasion. 'a' is much better.]
;B[co];W[cq];B[bo];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[en]LB[eq:a][do:b][dn:c]
[eo:d][fn:e]C[Not needed. 'a' in snete is better.  If W cuts at 'b' B can capture with Wb, Bc, Wd, Be]
;W[kn]LB[jo:a][ch:b]C[Far too timid.  W has considerable strength in the LR and should not use it for territory.  'a' is better, but 'b' is still biggest.]
;B[in]LB[cf:a]C[B is only defending a few points here.  'a' is much bigger]
;W[mk]C[Again, trying to take territory with thickness.];B[nf]
C[Small. B's group is in no danger];W[le]C[This move on the 5th line is rarely good unless it is part of an attack.  In this case it is not.  The left side is huge compared ot these last few moves.]
;B[lp]LB[cf:a]C[A nothing move.  There is almoset no territory here for either side so this is like filling a dame or passing. 'a' is worth at least 30 pts.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[np];B[mo];W[mn];B[ko];W[ln];B[jo]LB[kr:a]C[This whole sequence from B51 bis meaningless.  B gains nothing unless he defends against Wa and even then it is a mere pittance.]
;W[gk]C[Small.  B's territory is not going to grow my too much comapred to the potential on the left]
;B[cf]C[At last!!!!];W[ce];B[bf]LB[df:a][ed:b]C[Must be 'a', which protects the side while aiming at 'b'.  This is why W36 was played in the wrong place earlier.]
;W[be]LB[df:a][dg:b][eg:c][dh:d]C[Wa, Bb, Wc, Bd is better.  Then W can play at 64 if he wishes.  B cannot resist these moves and invade the corner without losing a lot on the side.]
;B[df];W[gm]C[Small that jumping sideways to the left.];B[gn]
LB[el:a]C['a' is better. This move only defends a few points.]
;W[fm];B[em];W[fn];B[fo];W[hn];B[go];W[im];B[ho];W[hm];B[jn]
;W[jm];B[jj]C[Over stretched.  See comment on next move.];W[kk]
LB[li:a]C[Too defensive.  W must play at 'a' to cut off the B stone.  It may have trouble living.  Even if it does B will gain nothing from it and W will gain something from the attack.]
;B[kj]LB[ki:a]C[Too heavy. 'a' looks lighter];W[lj];B[hj];W[hk]
LB[gj:a]C[Must be at 'a'.  W cannot let B connect so easily.  If 'a' then the 3 B stones are cut of on both sides.]
;B[li];W[mi]LB[ki:a]C[Better to cut at 'a'.  This stone would not be easily captures so B would be cut.]
;B[mh];W[mj];B[kh];W[jf]LB[fd:a]C[W's top is growing too much.  B needs to try something like 'a' and hope to get away with something.]
;B[ff]C[Too meek.  This is no way to win.];W[gj];B[hi]LB[fd:a]
C[This move has little value.  After W ignored B91, B must follow up with 'a']
;W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk];W[ao];B[an];W[ap];B[bn];W[af];B[ag]
;W[ae];B[bg]C[Both these hanes were double sente.  W gained 8 points unconditionally by getting them.]
;W[rk];B[rj];W[he]C[Nice move. Secures everything at the top.]

;B[de];W[cc];B[fi];W[gi];B[fh]C[Why not block?];W[ej];B[ei]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[gs]LB[rc:a][rd:b]C[All the moves from 109 onwards have been very small compared to Ba or Wb.  These corner moves are worth well over 10 pts.]
;B[hs];W[fs];B[hr]LB[mr:a]C[Better to defend at 'a'];W[rd];B[gh]
LB[sd:a]C[Nothing compared to 'a'.];W[sj]LB[se:a][sk:b]C['a' is bigger because it is double sente, that is B can also hane in sente.  B cannot hane at 'b' in sente so W will probably get to play this anyway.]
;B[si];W[sk];B[ri];W[gf];B[fe]LB[sd:a]C['a' first - it is absolute sente]
;W[ge]LB[hg:a]C[This move is dame. 'a' is the point to play in this area.]
