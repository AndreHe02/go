PW[pmurphy]PB[Tumblekax]WR[11k]BR[12k]DT[2008-05-25]PC[The KGS Go Server at http://www.gokgs.com/]C[Thanks for the review!  I took white in this game, and won by 8.5 points.  There are a couple of things I think I should have been able to do better in this game, specifically preventing black's expansion on the right side and responding better to black's 3x3 invasion in the southwest corner (I do see how I could have contained it better).

I feel like I'm stuck, I find myself winning handicap games against 6k players and then losing to 14k players right afterward (I've dropped from 8k to 11k on KGS in the past few months).  I study tsumego pretty regularly (mostly on goproblems.com) and have just downloaded a library of pro games to study.  Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks again!


Thanks for the game.  As a reviewer, I'd be much more interested in seeing a game that you lost rather than one that you won.  I would probably have much more constructive criticism.  As it is, I see a few things that could improve your game quite a bit.  I comment on some of these in the game itself.  I leave general comments at the end.]RE[W+8.50]
;B[qc]
;W[dp]
;B[dc]C[B is opening quite low.]
;W[op]C[This response seems odd.  B has comitted to playing a very low game.  There is no reason for you to overcompensate and go very high.  I would certainly have played R4 here.  That would give you a balance between low and high, and would force B to worry about gaining influence.]
;B[qp]
;W[lp]C[This is quite a strange response.  See here for normal joseki <http://senseis.xmp.net/?45PointJosekis>.

Imagine this sequence.  B opens R4, you respond P4, B plays tenuki.  Would you then make the M4 move?  I think not.. you would probably take advantage of B having left R4 alone.]
;B[cq]C[This seemed very early for a 3x3 invasion, I figured I could use the sente I would gain here to my advantage, but the sequence threw me off.

B is pursuing low territory almost neurotically ^_^.  You nearly got the joseki right.  See the variation at move 20.]

;B[gr]C[You are fine up to this point.]
(;W[hr]C[This is the mistake.  It seems like allowing B to crawl is giving him free territory, but really it's *ideal* for you.  You would love to let him crawl along the 2nd line all day.  The result is hugely in W's favor.  See variation.]

;B[km]
;W[en]TR[fn][eo]SQ[de][cf]C[These B stones are already hopelessly weak.  Try to play as B here and see how you would use them if W didn't play E6.  There is some aji to be sure, but it's too early to address it now.  If you are worried about D10 being split, you have a much better option in approaching the top left corner, which is something you'd like to do anyway.  Always keep an eye out for efficient moves like that.

I'll add in some general advice here.  Often openings devolve into fighting, as this one did (usually because someone makes a mistake).  Some beginning players will get focused on the fight and forget that the game is still in the opening stages.  It seems like E6 is this type of move.  There are still *huge* moves on the board that are more opening-type moves.  Don't get tunnel vision on the fight.  Consider the entire board.  Often one of the opening-type moves will even help with the fighting, which is great efficiency.

By the way, when selecting what approach to use in the upper left, consider that you are trying to help out the D10 stone.  If you approach at C15, you are likely to get a pincer in response.  That will mean more struggle.  C14 is a move that is very unlikely to get a pincer, and D15 is okay as well.  Be thinking this way when you approach, especially when there is signigicant action nearby.  Each approach is similar, but they have their different purposes.]
;B[cg]C[This is very nice for B now, he could not have hoped for this much gain out of those weak stones.]
;W[jd]C[Not approaching the corner kind of forced you into an awkward move here.]
;B[gc]
;W[mc]
;B[ll]
;W[hm]C[Very strange.  This group is not threatened in the least.  This move gets you next to nothing.  That B responds is just lucky.]
;B[hl]
;W[in]SQ[pd][qq]C[Again, there are *huge* moves remaining.  Trading small captures is end-game stuff.  If you're not fighting for survival, look around before you move.  (you should do that even if you are fighting for survival)]
;B[il]SQ[nd][gg][oo][oq]C[Lucky again.  B has much better options.]

;B[fi]
;W[ei]
;B[fh]C[This exchange has been good for B.  Your group on top is now isolated.  B is strong and can use that wall to attack.  You have simply assured yourself of territory that is already yours.  Granted, it's bigger than it might have been, but I still judge this in B's favor.  Given his ultra-low early game, he is very grateful to have this great influence in the center.]
;W[pd]C[Finally!  At this point it's necessary.]
;B[qd]
(;W[pc]C[This is a classic wrong move.  There is a very well known proverb that states "hane at the head of two stones" <http://senseis.xmp.net/?HaneAtTheHeadOfTwoStones>.  By making this move, you are inviting B to make that nice play, which he does.  Most often, when you play a shoulder hit (Q16) and your opponent extends to contact you (R16), you will want to continue extending in that direction to avoid the hane.  See variation.]

In the early game (and at every point really) don't get tunnel vision on a fight.  Always look up and consider other options.  Obviously, you don't want to lose a big group, but you spent a lot of time squabbling over small points when there were quite large points remaining.

One move that turned out to be pretty important was 74.  Remember that proverb and how to avoid getting caught with a hane or double-hane against you.

You will hit a lot of plateaus in your learning curve.  I'm currently dealing with a nice plateau at the 5k level that I can't seem to get past.  It is frustrating as a new player, because the progression through the twenty and teen kyu levels is so fast.  Your studying will pay off, as will practicing.  Remember also to take your time.  That's a huge sticking point when playing online.  It's so tempting to make the first move that pops into your head.  It's not such an issue when playing on a real board.  Force yourself to consider the whole board, especially during fights, when it's most tempting to play locally.  Play as if every move your opponent makes is unexpected and you have to find the best way to respond.  That will allow you to play more good tenuki and keep yourself aware of the entire board.  If you find yourself moving within 10 or 15 seconds of your opponent's move, you are going too fast.

In terms of study material, tsumego are very useful.  Pro games are also very good to learn from, but you have to do it right.  I picked up a pro game (Lee ChangHo v. Han SangHoon <http://www.go4go.net/v2/modules/collection/sgfview.php?id=15900>) and studied only that game for a month and memorized about 3/4 of it.  I think that's the way to do it.  Just reading pro games won't help you.  You have to get down and try to understand each move.  Memorization helps you do that.  The better you understand a move, the easier it is to memorize.  If you find you can't memorize a particular move or sequence, it's probably because you don't understand it.  So I would advise you to pick a recent game (the one I linked is quite nice) and work only with it for a while.  Try to emulate the style in your games.  See if you can pick out the moves that pro might have made.  You become aware of which of your moves look weak or passive.  Don't make random moves you don't understand just because they look pro.. try to see where you are making a move that definitely doesn't look good and find a better one.  Trying to figure out what move your pro of choice would make also helps to slow you down.

I hope this is helpful for you.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I hope you beat your 12k plateau soon.
