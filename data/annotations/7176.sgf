Hi! This is my recent game with friend, so we'd like review for both colours. We aren't best fighters, so your help with this would be appreciated. Hope you enjoy reviewing. Thanks!

yoyoma: This game had several big fights, and during those fights both sides make mistakes of direction.  During one of the breaks in the action, white made a direction mistake on move 118.  Of course more fierce fighting broke out.  :)]

;B[nq];W[qj];B[cn]LB[nq:11]C[Black approaches on the left instead of the bottom since 11 is low, good.  I would prefer playing F17 on the top to expand black's framework.]

(;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq]C[White settles quickly, but perhaps the bottom isn't interesting enough for this.]
;B[ck];W[oc];B[pc];W[od];B[qf]

;B[be];W[df];B[dc];W[ec];B[cc]C[So white gives up the corner for influence.  Somehow white should attack the two black stones now.  However it's hard to imagine where white's benefit will come.]

yoyoma: I think black's result is better.];B[gm]
(;W[iq]LB[ng:D][qj:C][fq:A][nq:B]C[too small?

yoyoma:  Yes because A and B are both very strong.  The C group is weak, so extending from C defends and also forms a better relationship with the D stone.

This is a very important point about these short extensions, they're mostly about defending against an invasion, or preventing the opponent making an extension which would setup an invasion next.]

(;B[oi];W[ph];B[oh];W[og];B[pi]C[unneccesary?

yoyoma:  It creates some weaknesses, and black followed it up with a cut, so I think it's good.]
