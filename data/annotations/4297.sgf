C[To the reviewer:

This game was not timed, ranked, or anything that might motivate
a person to do his best. And yet this game was intense, thoughtful,
and exceedingly difficult. I lost miserably, and I'd like some
comments on how to do better. Wherever a slap to my Go is deserved,
please slap away.];B[dp];W[qc];B[dd];W[pp]
(;B[qn]C[RM: Since black has played both start points he is aiming for
an influence orientated game. For consistancy it would seem correct
to play Q16 or D10.];W[nq];B[rp];W[qq];B[pj]C[I did not take advantage of this weakness until later in the
game. Did I practice proper timing?

RM:  :-)
J2 would be correct for black J4.];B[gq];W[gr];B[fp];W[hq];B[gp]
;W[ip]C[Was this the proper move?

RM: Since D2 and F3 are connected still and F5 still has aji,
then your sequence is an efficient use of the right hand side
group.];B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[fs];B[qe];W[od];B[pd];W[pc];B[oe]

(;W[of]C[Rm: This is not helpful to white.];B[pe]C[now the aji has been reduced (before Q15 was filled, white S15

too greedy? I played it because I didn't think the cut at P17
(#8) would work.

RM: Capturing in sente may be bigger and it leaves a lot of bad
aji and many ko threats in the corner position...];B[ng];W[mg]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[ni];W[lj]LB[fc:B][fd:A][cf:C][ci:D][ql:E]C[It was difficult for me to decide between the kakari A through
C, the invasions at D and E, and the move I finally played. Was
this correct?

RM: This area is not so interesting for black or white (or urgent).
The area around F15, F16 is a big place for BOTH sides, and so
must be better.];B[dj];W[fd];B[ef]C[I should have expected this move, but I did not. I also did not
like my response.]
(;W[gf]C[Bleh.

RM: I think this is a big move. If black plays here white moyo
is reduced and blacks increased. D17 instead looks no better
...];B[hm]C[This felt like the second move I could exploit (the first being
Q10). Did I handle the chance properly, or was I deluding myself?

RM: Perhaps the timing of h7 was bad. You following invasion
at c12 was good, but i am not strong enough to tell you if it
was correct or not.];W[ch]

(;W[ce]C[Should I have played B18 and gone for the corner? I believe I
misread the following sequence, even though it eventually worked
out.

RM: Since the white corner group could then be seperated by
black it would lead to a life and death struggle which is hard
to calculate. I think playing c15 in sente is better.];B[ad]
;W[de];B[be];W[ee]C[I missed the cut at C14 (apparently, so did my opponent), but
what other choice did I have?

RM This is a good move for white.
If black cuts then the cutting group becomes weak...]
(;B[ec];W[fc];B[fi]C[This move felt liberating.];W[cf];B[eb]
;W[ql]C[I decided I was not going to get territory at the top, so I invaded.

RM: A good invasion point];B[pl];W[qk]C[I still wish I had played one of the hane at Q7 or Q9.]

C[This probably should have been at N3 for simplicity, but I think
the position was still salvageable...

RM: Right on both counts];B[mq];W[lq];B[mr];W[lr]C[The fatal mistake. This should have been at O2, right?]
;B[mo]
(;W[lp]C[RM: White must not connect, until after o2.];B[pr]
C[This took me by surprise. All my readings after this play showed
me that the best I could do was capture the two black stones.
Was there a miracle here?];W[or];B[qs]
(;W[hi]C[Until I started adding my questions to this file, I did not see
that connecting at Q3 was okay. >__< This cost me my chance in
the game, too!

RM: Yes connecting gives a very large ko.];B[pq];W[ms];B[gj]
;W[hj];B[hk]
(;W[ll]C[There were a bunch of hard choices I faced. I decided that reducing
here was the best thing I could manage. Should I have instead
defended at F18? (Yes, I knew very well that I was zzzzzza's
mop at this point)

RM: Well if black plays g18, white will score nothing above row
16, and blacks corner group will be worth about 14. black's potential
to the right of m8 is about 6 points. So in these regions black
is about +20. If white playes F18, blacks corner will be worth
13 or less and white will get about 10 points above row 16. Black
o7 area may be worth 14 or so. So black would be about +17.

So white is better playing f18, it just goes to show how big
this sort of defensive move is.];B[gb];W[hc];B[hb];W[ic];B[jk]

the game, too, but I felt I had to risk this.];B[bq]
(;W[cr]C[RM: Too small,  k11 better.];B[ji];W[ij];B[kk]C[This move surprised me... once again, I was oblivious to the
obvious. Should I have tried to merely connect my stones at M9
and let him reduce me some in the center?

RM: Either way will be a huge loss. After connecting black will
make a bamboo joint and if white defends the center black can
still cut off the three white stones and gain extra benefit attacking
them. Also white is weak around G11 and so the invasion will
be costly.];W[jj];B[kj];W[ki];B[li];W[kh];B[lk];W[km]C[After this, I thought I was fine... I missed a very important
fact in my reading...];B[kn];W[ln];B[lo];W[jn];B[ko];W[jo];B[jm]
C[... and that fact was that, since I did not have a stone at N6,
he could successfully cut me at K7. And thus I resigned.

I look forward to your wisdom.

missed some urgent defensive moves.])
