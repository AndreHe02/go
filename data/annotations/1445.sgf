C[Dear reviewer:
Hello, I took black in this game and lost.
I appreciate some pointers on where I played slack moves to let white get ahead.
I added some of my questions and comments.
Thanks for your help.         Zee];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[jp]C[I think so far so good

wild : Yes, so far so good];W[qc];B[cf]TR[ep]C[I do not know if I should have ignored R17
It seemed that C14 is large and gives me the initiative

wild : I would not have ignored R17. Blocking at R16 is good enough. C14 is big but not urgent as it is star point. Easy to invade later. Of the two white corners, the bottom left corner is more urgent. A good position to consider is the marked position. It extends black moyo, which is the main theme of the chinese fuseki.]
;W[fd]C[Good response by white. Balances the low O17.];B[ci]
;W[ce];B[df]C[wild: There is strong suspect that white has helped strengthened black by playing C15. White top corner is still not secure after this exchange. Black can invade at opportune time. See variations.]

(;W[fq];B[po];W[qi]C[I am not sure how to respond to this

wild : This is a good move by white, although I would have chosen R12  instead. Black's two stones are under pressure. Its base is effectively gone when R17 is not blocked.]

(;B[ok]TR[oi]C[This move leaves the two stones at the top right vulnerable. What is a better move or variation?

wild : See my variations. This move is very bad for black. It leaves white with the obvious response P11. That makes the two black stones on top even weaker. White will benefit greatly from attacking them, even without having to kill them.]
;W[oi]C[wild : As expected :-(.];B[re]TR[me]C[wild : Bad idea. Black has no base. Better to play light at N15 and move towards the centre of the board.]
;W[rg]C[Now my three black stones in the top right are under attack

wild :  They're under attack even earlier!];B[ne]TR[mf]SQ[oi]
[qi][rg]C[wild : Black's shape is heavy and still do not have enough eye space. I might consider N1. It's faster and exerts more pressure on white marked group which also do not have eye space yet.]
;W[ld]C[wild : Good move. Getting territory while maintaining the attack on black.]

(;B[ng]TR[mi]C[wild : If you're good at fighting, may consider capping at N11 instead.]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[rj]
(;B[ql]TR[mi]C[wild : Should have taken the opportunity to cap at N11. See variation.]
;W[mi]C[wild : Needless to say, this is bad for black.];B[lf]
;W[je]C[wild : Again, good mobve. Gaining territory while maintaining attacking posture.]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[nh]C[I seem to have waisted many moves her trying to make life for this group

wild : Yes. No urgent need at this moment. Black is not completely surrounded yet. Make life only when you really have to. For this case, better to move to the centre but away from the top so that white do not naturally gain territory on top.]

MA[ki][li][mi][mh][ni][oi][pi][qi][rk][rj][rh][rg]C[wild : This move (J4) does not serve much purpose. Though it cut square group from triangle group, white have reinforcement from cross group. Besides, it gives white chance to play M6 and create good shape. Black should have played M6 instead.]
;W[ln];B[mo];W[cl]C[wild : Good. White has reduced black's moyo inn bottom right in sente and turn attention back to biggest play left on the board.]
;B[hn]TR[kk]C[wild : Better to play L9. Force white to run towards his potential territory in the bottom left. In that way, while chasing them, you reduce his potential for territory.

As a rule of thumb, force baseless groups to run in the direction of their moyo or area of potential territory. That way, while giving chase, you naturally enter their potential territory and reduce that potential.]
;W[kk];B[eo];W[dn];B[he]C[this invasion did not turn out as well as I wanted]
;W[hd];B[id];W[ie];B[gd];W[hc];B[ge];W[gc];B[cc]TR[gd][ge][he]
[hd][id][hc][gc][ie]C[wild :  Should have invaded here before playing the marked exchange. I suspect the invasion may not stand anymore given that white has strengthened itself near the marked stones. Anyway, it depends on how white response.]
;W[be];B[eb]C[Can I live here? It seems that I should be able to but do not know how! Any hint?

wild : I'm not sure. It depends on how white react. There are many possibilities.]
;W[ec]
(;B[dc];W[fb];B[cd];W[de];B[bd]
(;W[bb]C[wild : Strange move. Gives black chance to make life with ko. Could have played as shown in variation.]

(;B[bf];W[af];B[ag];W[ae];B[bh]C[wild : Effectively surrending the game. The game is effectively over by now.]
;W[fe];B[eq];W[dq]
(;B[ep]TR[er]C[wild : Black could extend to E2. See variation.

The rest of the game is inconsequential and so I end my comments here. I hope you find my comments helpful.]
