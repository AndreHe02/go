Game lasted around an hour.

Hi,
My name is Sylvain and I'm about 5 kyu (KGS). I will begin all my comments with "Syl >".
First of all, an obvious comment : this is a 9 handicap game. This means that white will fight very hard with some "tricky" moves, waiting for a mistake...
So let's try to find where are those mistakes...

Of course, as black, you should try to connect your stones and cut those of your opponent. And you should not enter complicated fights.]
;W[fc]LB[cf:B][pm:A][qo:C][qp:D]C[Syl > after F17, B is much better than A
1/ A is a tenuki : white is free to attack your D16 stone (move 56...). Well, it is possible to tenuki after F17, but as it is a 9 stones game, you should reinforce your stones. Don't let white attack your stones. Reinforce them !
2/ Q7 doesn't protect the corner. If you really want to close the corner, then play at C or D (and symmetric)]
(;B[pm];W[nq]LB[np:A][oq:B]C[Syl > K4 is a black stone, so I think that P3 is correct here for white, whereas O4 is not a bad move.]
(;B[np];W[oq];B[pq]C[I didnt know what to do here so I just tried to protect the corner. Is there a better way to fend of his attack?

;W[op];B[po];W[oo];B[on]TR[pm][po]C[Syl > very nive shape ! Q7 was a strange move, but you used it very well ! Nice sequence]
;W[no];B[mp]LB[np:1]C[Syl > oups... No need for black to protect the O4 stone. This is only 1 point. Black can forget O4 stone and play elsewhere to reinforce his position (or attack F17, or instance).]
;W[lr];B[lq];W[kr];B[kq];W[iq];B[jr]C[Syl > very good move ! White stones are cut !]
;W[jq];B[ir];W[mq];B[hq];W[kp];B[ip];W[lp];B[jq]C[Syl > again, no need to save L3 group. Only 2 points...]
;W[lo];B[mm]LB[ec:B][qd:C][co:A]C[Syl > white group is alive now. You should not try to attack it. A, B or C are some alternatives to N7]
;W[cn]LB[co:B][fp:A]C[Syl > B was better than A : black buid safely a strong territory at the bottom and white is still weak]
(;B[fp]C[Here i tried to solidify bottom and bottom right corner was it too defensive?

Syl > F4 is joseki, but this is bad here because of your very powerful stones at the bottom. With F4, black closes the corner from the strong side... Strange, isn't it ? But you are right : it's time to tranform the bottom in territory.]

;B[as]LB[ec:D][qd:C][cr:B][as:A]C[This is a start of a stupid mistake, I think I should have played c3, or is there somewhere else I should have played?

Syl > same comment as before (move 11) : A is strange. You should consider B or C instead. Or D (see variation)]
;W[cf]LB[ce:A][ee:B][df:C]C[Syl > It is 9 handicap game, so black has stones almost everywhere on the goban. Therefore I prefer to play B or C rather than trying to live in the corner, as in the game.]

;B[md]C[Should i have played c 17 instead to solidify my corner? Coming up is a big battle for the corner
Syl > this is a high handicap game, so I would have played C17. Otherwise, white will play there for sure because he wants the game to become complicated...
These moves are not very good for black. He may win the corner, but white gains strengh to attack outside.  Moves 57 and 59 were too defensive.]

;W[ab];B[cd];W[db];B[dn]LB[ea:B][co:A]C[At this moment I tought I had lost the corner but it could still live at D17, and I played there later because the opponent did nothing either

(;B[fm]LB[fj:B][fm:A]TR[cf][bp]C[Syl > A is bad : black is strong at the bottom, so he must not fear white. You should not touch F8 stone : white will become stronger. Is it really what you need ?
Here it's difficult to cut the white stone from white thickness because his 2 groups are strong (triangles). I think the best move here is to jump to the center from D10 to prevent a big white moyo as in the game.]

;W[gm];B[fn];W[gk]TR[fg][dh][fi][dk][bl]C[Syl > very, very bad sequence for black. Do you see why ?
White has now a big moyo on the side (triangle) and black didn't get much at the bottom. That's why F10 was important at move 87, instead of F7]
;B[hl];W[gl];B[hn]LB[qc:B][qd:C][hn:A]C[Syl > A is small. B or C get the whole corner for example.]

After seeing this game, do you think he is worthy of 2k+, and what rank do you think I am around?

Thank you very much for your time.

Syl > The main advice is : play safely. Simplicity is the best for handicap games.

That means :
1/ play a keima if your opponent plays a low approach to your hoshi stone (example : move 11 is better at C14)
2/ don't play (during first moves at least) right at the middle of your handicap stones (example : moves 11, 55)

Moreover :
3/ don't try to save all your stones (example : move 21 N4 is better elsewhere on the goban). A stone which doesn't cut the opponent stones is worthless.

And... congratuliations for your game against a 2k+ !!!])
