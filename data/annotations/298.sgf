;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[cc]C[Great
moves by both players up to and including black 5.  C16 might be another
choice for black 5.];W[dd]C[I'm pretty sure D16 is not joseki.  Now, that
doesn't automatically mean it's a bad move, particularly in a kyu level
game where the loss of some tiny advantage during corner play may be
negligible, but let's examine this move in some detail.]
(;B[cd]C[This is  probably a fine reply to white's kosumi.  White now
*must* play either D15 or C15.  D15 is safer and builds up a wall but puts
very little pressure on black.]
(;W[hc]C[H17 is a terrrible move.  White  proably perceives this as an
extension from a wall.  But there's no wall!  (becasue black is going to
play D15 immediately, as that's where the action is).  Furthermore, it's
too close to the other white sones, so it's over-concentrated and
inefficient.  If white had a stone at D15, then an extension around K16
would be appropriate.  White must play D15 not H17.]
(;B[fq]C[obviously black  F3 should be at D15 to take advantage of white's
mistake.  Actually, now with H17 in place, white might be able to hane at
C15 (!).];W[cn]C[C6 is a very good reply to F3.  It patiently aims to
hane at C15, the most important area of the board.  But if white were to
play there now, black might ignore it to double kakari D4.  This would be
OK for white, but the patient move at C6 is fine too.];B[jp]C[everybody's
still missing C15/D15, but locally K4 is a fine move and works well in
conjunction with the two star points (Q16 and Q4).];W[hq]C[The white
invasion at H3 is about fifty moves or more premature.  This is small
compared with C15, O17, R10, R14, or R6, all of which would be excellent
moves.  In the opening, one should play stones where there are few other
stones, unless there is an urgent need to play elsewhere.  C15 is urgent,
and the other moves I listed are big.  H3 is just a small invasion.  White
will learn the most by absorbing this single point in my whole game
analysis.  It's just not important to make small invasions in the opening.
Go is a game of balance.  Let your opponent have something, and take
something of your own.  In the end, you'll both have about the same
amount.  If you try to deprive your opponent of every little scrap of
territory, you'll end up rushing about and never make any for yourself,
and worse, your opponent will have plenty of targets for attack to use to
build territory of their own.  You can advance several ranks by not making
this kind of attack.  I'm still training myself to avoid this kind of
thing, and I'm still getting better.

Now, since H3 is small, the strongest way for black to play is to ignore
it and play the urgent move at D15 or a really big move like R10.]
(;B[gp]C[F4, the kosumi attack against G3 is a very aggressive move,
usually played with an intent to kill.  But with the strong white stones
at D4 and D6, this is unreasonable.  It is black who is weaker here, so
black should just play the standard move at H4 if black decides to respond
locally.
After F4, white will probably counterattack strongly at H4.]

;W[np];B[no];W[nq];B[pj]C[OK, so we end up with what seems
like a pretty reasonable trade of profit for influence.  But black now has
the lead, as the influence is superior to the profit at this point in the
game.  This stems fromthe poor timing of the H3 invasion.  Remember:
C15/D15 is still the urgent move.];W[oo];B[nn];W[nc];B[nd];W[qc]C[R17 is  strange.  If white wanted to go into the corner, why play
O17 first?  Not only that, but black is about to develop overwhelming
center influence.  Better to resign than to play R17.];B[qd];W[rd]C[White
is forgetting about O17 twice in a row. Black will now play Q17 separating
white and then what?]
(;B[re];W[rb]C[T16 is the only move.  If you're afraid  of ko, don't play
Go.]
(;B[se];W[oc];B[od];W[nj];B[oh]C[OK, the last little bit through black P12
was pretty good on both sides.  Now white P14 seems a little inconsistent.
Probably the best thing to do is jump lightly to M10 or maybe O7 and think
about using the aji coming from a play at Q5.
     Putting a stone at P14 is giving black two targets.  White is bound
to lose something.]
(;W[of]C[R13 is humiliatingly low and is bad shape to  boot.  If you're a
coward and worried about the cut at R15, then play R14.  Since black is so
darn strong here however, fighting at O14 or O13 looks feasible.]
(;B[qg];W[pg];B[qh];W[mf];B[nf]C[black should probably play N12 or N16
here.  N16 looks good to me. O13 is an outirght loss.  Kind of like giving
white a couple of handicap stones.  Almost never do you put a stone in the
middle of a one point jump.  And then you have *read* out *all* the
variations.]

better at C5. (see suite)];W[bn];B[co];W[do]C[how about D6?]
(;B[an];W[am];B[ao];W[bm];B[cp];W[en]C[obviously white got away with more
than black did in this corner.
L14 looks vague and purposeless.  If white is worried about his center
group, white will play N12, so if black wants to attack this group, black
should play there.
  Meanwhile a white play at C15 would seem to be pretty harsh.]
