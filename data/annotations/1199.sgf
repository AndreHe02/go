C[Dear reviewer:

I played black and I loose by 1 point  without komi (6,5 with komi).

My strength is about 16 kyu but I don't  really know these.

I put some commentaries.

Thanks for advanced.

Dear Joanco,
I hope this review will help you. I didn't  say much about your endgame,  because I got tired in the end.
A stronger player than me could make  more usefull coments. I tried to do my  best.

;W[mo];B[fj];W[ej];B[ei]LB[mp:a]C[As I said before, that group is dead.
Such moves are good as ko-threats.  So, you should leave the position as it  is and use it to fight a ko in the future.
Instead of this you should play "a".];W[mp]
