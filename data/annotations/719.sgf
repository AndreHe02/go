(;B[fp]C[Since you already have stones this direction, you could think
of using the pincer to take some territory and outside influence.

Or just take the corner directly.  This move feels a little overconcentrated
with the two stones already in place down the edge.];W[cj];B[cg]

take the corner more solidly.];W[fd];B[eg]C[good];W[ie]

to almost every move.  Now is a chance to take sente.];W[ig]

(;B[re]C[I would just play to take the corner territory.  This
move helps white defend the long extension.];W[rf];B[qe];W[of]
C[Black is maybe 3 or 4 points better than just taking the corner,
but white has gained much more, and no longer has to add another
move on the right edge.];B[po];W[np];B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[rr]

(;B[qm]C[Play here if you want to live on the edge.  Since you
decided you would rather run out, maybe another move is better.]
;W[ok];B[om];W[nl];B[nm];W[ll];B[rl];W[rk]C[White is playing very simple, straightforward
moves so far.]
(;B[mm]C[Are you afraid of dying here?  If so, playing on
the edge is probably better.  This move doesn't have much effect
on white.  Better to just live or take play a big move.];W[cq]
;B[cp];W[bp]
(;B[bo]C[You play this move if you want to give up the corner territory
for an attack on the outside.  Of course, this attack won't kill
the white stones, so you have to think about where you will gain
territory or thickness from the coming attack.  If you can't
find some compensation in the attack from giving up the corner
territory, you should save the corner territory instead.];W[bq]

;W[eb];B[db];W[dc];B[cb];W[ed];B[bc];W[bn]
(;B[an]C[better to just descend.  since you are planning to attack these
stones, you don't want to leave white with a free sente atari
later to help him make eye shape.];W[bl]
(;B[dn]C[this is too easy on him, since it gives him a sente response.]
;W[dm];B[em]C[This is good, if you plan to give up a stone.]
;W[en]
(;B[do]C[this makes a big clunky group of stones, so you should avoid
it if possible.  You get a much better result if you give up
a stone.];W[el];B[fm];W[dl];B[fl];W[bh]C[Too bad white gets this.  The black move below it
was sente agaisnt the weak white group earlier, so black should
have been able to play here first.];B[bg];W[mf]C[A very big point.]

(;B[ln]C[This is not good.  It doesn't take any points and has
no effect of white.  It's like playing a dame.  The game
is already about even on territory, so black has to
play to get more points.

There are lots of better alternatives.];W[kq]
(;B[ko]C[Another dame move.

It looks like black was worried about the life of his  group.  But he played 3 moves to connect it out to
let it live, all of which were dame.  This is like giving back
3 handicap stones.  It only took one move
to live on the side, which would have been much better.

Since black can live on the edge, or connect out, his group is
in no danger at all, so he should answer white's last move on
the edge.];W[jr];B[iq];W[kg];B[sf];W[sg];B[se];W[rh]
(;B[ek]C[building a wall here is not a good plan.];W[dk];B[ch]
;W[bi]C[This exchange gives white several points, so the wall has to
gain a few points back just to break even.];B[ej]C[Black's last 3 moves end in gote, strengthen the white group,
and gain black very little in the center.

Building a wall is not very effective when you end in gote unless
it faces a weak group or builds
territory.];W[jk]C[white expands his territory and reduces the wall's effectiveness.]
;B[ii];W[ji]
(;B[im];W[ij];B[hi];W[oc]C[A frightening move.  White already has a won game, so he doesn't
have to try this.]
(;B[od]C[It seems like black can block on the left here, since the corner
is so strong.  But it takes careful reading.

But black is behind, so I think he has to try to prevent white
from getting away with this swindle.];W[mc];B[nc];W[md];B[me]
;W[le];B[mb];W[ne];B[lc]C[White gained a lot here.];W[ir];B[hr]
;W[hj];B[gj];W[gk];B[fj];W[jb]C[Black should have gotten this move.  It was double sente, but
black has a bigger threat, so he should get there first.];B[kp]

;W[ih];B[hh];W[gg]
(;B[gf]C[I don't understand this move.  Giving up 3 stones  is a big loss
in the endgame.

You break about 6 points of white territory, so the exchange
is not so bad, but it would be better to play a move that takes
points.];W[hg];B[ff];W[gi];B[gd];W[fe]C[This move exposes the cut weakness in the corner, but that is
not easy to see coming.];B[ge];W[bb]

C[Now white is way ahead and the rest of the endgame is fairly
straightforward.

Interesting that black tried to take territory using his 4-4
point stones in 3 corners, and two of the 3 ended up being white
territory in the end.];B[hd];W[kf];B[ld];W[me];B[id];W[jm];B[jn]
