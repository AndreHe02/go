C[Hi. Although I win this game I would like to review it to find mistakes and better move choices.

===

Hello, I'm Julien, 1k kgs, I have reviewed your game and have given you feedback and variations. As a quick summary, I would say that you should really focus on shapes: you play a lot of bad shapes in this game. Good shapes are really important to get eyes, prevent tesujis like damezumari and snapbacks, etc. You could avoid a lot of bad positions by playing good shape moves.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ed]C[E17 would make more sense so all my pieces arn't 4th line...

It would be more usual but noone can say that E16 is really a bad move.]
;W[jd]C[This one would be certainly better at K17 (easier to take a base for the life of the upcoming group).]
;B[hc]C[To me this seems like secure territory now. I would not know how to invade it to make like. What is the weakness of this shape?]
;W[mc]C[O17 would be more natural to: standard approach of the corner.]

(;B[qf]TR[oc]C[I should have pressured whites group...

This move is fine: don't attack while you are not solid, so playing solid first is fine. Also because K16 is badly placed, white cannot get life with only 1 additional stone. Maybe playing P17 is possible to but I would have played R14 (or maybe Q14 to put a bit more pressure on white).]
;W[qn]
(;B[fq]C[better to play C6 for directional purposes?

I would prefer C6 (see my variations). It is also possible to directly attack the top. But it is a matter of style: I cannot say that your move is bad.]
;W[hp]C[Unusual.]
(;B[cn];W[fp];B[cq];W[cp]
(;B[bp]C[Mistake.];W[dq]
(;B[bq]C[Bad shape.];W[di]C[not really sure why I played like this in the lower left corner. How can I start to look forward in my plan better?

The lower left was not perfect but the game is still ok for black (I prefer black up to now).]

(;B[dg]
(;W[ck];B[jq];W[iq];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[pk];B[qi]TR[jp]C[It is big but K4 looks like urgent for the base of your group : prefer urgent moves to big moves :-).]
;W[oc]C[Bad move: should be at q18. More generally a kosumi on the 3d line against a stone on the 4th line is almost always a bad move.]
;B[pc]
(;W[jp]C[Bad move: white should attack at M3.];B[kq];W[kp];B[lq]
;W[bh];B[ch];W[ci];B[bg];W[dh];B[eg]TR[cg]C[Horrible: you must connect at c13.]
;W[cg];B[cf]
(;W[fj]
(;B[kc]C[Locally it is indeed the best move to attack white.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[jc];W[le]
(;B[id]C[Bad move: why to play a purely defensive move here?
Nevertheless I have to say that this group is not easy to attack (more preciselly, it is possible to attack it but it is unclear what you will get in the fight). Thus it is probably better to not attack it right away and tenuki.]
;W[je]C[trying to invade and split the K16 stone...didn't work...]

(;B[rk]TR[dm][or]C[biggest point on the board isn't this...where is it?

Indeed it is big. But P2 is urgent while D7 is also bigger.
Note that P2 is urgent and also almost sente because it threatens to take the corner.]
;W[ql]C[Now the invasion at R3 does not work anymore and so P2 is no more sente (even if still urgent).]
;B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[fr];B[en]C[Good move but D7 is probably a better shape in this position (less aji with the b5/b6 cuts even if  none of  them works very well right now.]
;W[gn];B[qq]C[should I have contined to expand the C/E 6 stones or is the timing right for the corner invasion?

This move does not work anymore (because of the s9/r8 exchange). Even if it would have worked, it would have been bad because M3 is not stable and would probably have die in response. For me, P2 is the only move in this position.]

(;B[no]C[You shouldn't play it right now because you're erasing all the aji of the q6 stones but you gain almost nothing in exchange (your group is still not yet alive).]
;W[on];B[nn];W[om]
(;B[od]C[Locally p18 is far bigger.];W[ob];B[pb];W[nd]C[Now white is almost alive with points.]

(;W[hs]C[White mistake.];B[ks];W[nh]C[After this point the game seems straight forward in many way and we just settle the edges of our territory. Please help me see any other invasion or reduction points I am missing...

This move is weird ;-). Locally I think that Q13 is far better (even if a bit complicated) or at least Q12 which is quite simple.

My remaining comments are almost about your bad shapes. I did not focus on the biggest yose move globally but I'm pretty sure that both of you missed big moves: for instance b14 was huge.]
