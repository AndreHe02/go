;B[cd];W[pd];B[pq]LB[dp:E][pp:B][qp:A][dq:D][qq:C]C[This is an interesting opening. Typically, if you had played a C16, you would play at A, to maintain symmetry. B, possibly C could work as well.

Another opening style could be to play at E or D.

Regardless, playing on opposite corners like you did encourages a game with lots of fighting, as you saw. If you wish to have less fights, play on E or D. But I won't go into too much depth on opening theory; you can read about that more on Sensei's Library if you wish.]
;W[qp]C[This move shows that he wants to start fighting immediately]
;B[po]CR[pk][pl][pm][pn]LB[np:C][op:B][pp:A][jq:E][mq:D]SQ[qk]
[ql][qm][qn][qo]C[This was an interesting reponse to his move. Depending on how "in your face" you wish to be, you should have played at A,B, C, D or E, with A being the most violent.

The problem I see with your move is that it is so early in the game and you are playing locally without making much gains. You might make gains later by winning the fight, but this may or may not happen. Playing in one of the labeled spots responds to white by solidifying your position, while at the same time grabbing territory for you.

Another way to view the situation is using the circles and squares. You are starting to form a moyo, or wall, with your stones. This will give you strength and control towards the center of the board, to the left of the circles. White is beginning to form his moyo to the right of the squares, toward the edges. When going to the edges like that, white is going for guranteed points/territory. Your moves instead are going to give you strength when you want to fight in the center, but no immediate points.

There is a balance between playing for territory and playing for influence. I recommend that you google and look for some articles on this. Here is one of sensei's articles that you might find helpful. http://senseis.xmp.net/?TerritoryVersusInfluenceStyles]
;W[qn]C[This further defines the moyos that I talked about in move 5.]
;B[qo]C[I think you are playing too much locally at this point. Think of it is as penny-wise, pound-foolish. If your opponent had chosen to ignore this corner somewhat, he could have made large gains in the D4 corner.

A better move would have been to do something in the D4 corner, since no one has moved there yet.

You may say that you have to respond to white's move there right now, but this isn't the case. There is plenty of time to develop in the bottom right. If white keeps moving there to the point that your stones are in danger, you will have had enough time to move in the other areas of the board so that for every point that white made from playing in the bottom right, you will have made 2 or more points.]
;W[qq]
(;B[rp]C[Interesting.. I would not have expected this move. It doesn't really stick with the whole moyo concept.]

;B[ol];W[mo];B[mp];W[qm];B[ql];W[pl];B[pm]C[I'll mention again, I feel that both of you are neglecting other areas of the board in an attempt to just destroy each ther right now. The problem is, you don't develop much territory, so basically the games hinges on who wins this one fight, which is a very large gamble.

Overall though, you are winning the fight at this point. White is disconnected, where as you are very connected and can become even more so when you capture the 3 white stones with S3.]
;W[qk];B[rl];W[pk]
(;B[rm]C[not certain if this move was necessary.

It wasn't. If you look at the sequences below, it might be difficult to save those stones, but it is do-able if you take some time to read out the sequence. That being said, it's always good to play it safe sometimes, especially when a large part of your winning this fight is based off whether or not you can capture those 3 stones and that your 3 stones don't get capture.

If you hadn't played that move, later on, white would have tried to exploit the fact that those three stones were a little bit weaker. So while it might not have been necessary right then, I think it was the right move in the long run.]
;W[dp]C[See, white grabs the corner finally ;)];B[dj]LB[ec:B]
[jc:A]SQ[gc][hc][ic][dd][ed][fd][ce][cf][cg][dh][di]C[Playing at A would have been an interesting option to explore. This gives you a stronger shape than your move did. Look at the squares to see what kind of shape I'm talking about. Your move leaves room to come underneath and undermine the entire foundation, but A closes that off.

If you wanted to play a little bit slower, then joseki suggests that you play at B.

Since white made the 4-4 move in both corners, you should respond in whatever way that would make your 3-4 move in the corner stronger.

I suggest that in the future, you play at A.

Read up about 3-4 points in Sensei's library some to learn more.]
;W[ln]
(;B[nk];W[ml];B[je]LB[jc:A][jd:B]C[I'm just going to say now, I don't like this move. In the territory/influence balance, this is WAY too heavy on influence. It doesnt accentuate your 3-4 point at all.

Essentially, it gives you no actual points; to get value from this stone, you will have to fight for it. I would still prefer A, but B would also be preferable to this.]
;W[gg]C[Bad move by white. This really establishes nothing, other than possibly preventing ladder attacks.]

(;B[hh]LB[gd:A][cg:B]C[was this an appropriate way to handle his stone? should I have even worried?

It was an OK response, but there were definately better choices. You could have attacked the Q9 group of white stones by playing at R17 and undermiming the white corner. 

I think the response was too close to the white stone. It's still early, you should be playing farther back, since white didn't initiate a direct fight with this stone. Playing at or around A and B would have been good because it pressures the white stone while at the same time giving you lots more strength]
;W[if];B[md]LB[jc:B][hd:A]C[playing at A would be best because it starts to connect and make use of your C16 stone.

B is very conservative, but it will help give you a platform to either attack Q16 or connect back to C16.]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[jf];B[ke]LB[ie:A]C[I prefer A, but your move was good too, since your starting to make a moyo.]
;W[fi]
(;B[fh]LB[cg:C][ch:D][dh:B][gh:A]C[As you saw in the next move, this makes you vulnerable. You don't have enough nearby strength to disconnect from your other stones. A is the best, local move, but B or D, and possibly even C, would be better, because they pressure the white stones.

This pressure happens because they now have fewer places to run to and make eyes. Instead, they will be forced to fight in the middle to make their eyes, which is much harder than making an eye at the side.]
;W[gh];B[gi]C[This move only works because it's in the center. Otherwise you would have been in danger very quickly.]

LB[gm:A][go:B]C[the fight to kill the four stones started by this contact I figured would go pretty favorably for me, can you help with ways I could've sealed this up easier?

You're trying to hard. Let white have his 4 stones for now, make sure that your stones are alive before you try to kill his. A or B would be good because you can gain strength from your nearby stones. Your move split the difference and ended up giving white two directions to run in and didn't give you any help from your other stones.]
;W[go];B[fo]C[No... Your G6 stone is too weak right now. Play at G7 to make it live. True, white will get away, but you will contain him and he won't kill your stones.]
;W[gm];B[fn];W[gp];B[gq];W[fp];B[ep]C[Again, you have a hard time keeping this stone alive because white can use his stones to effectively pressure you, but your stones can't really help much.]

C8? I disagree. That is too conservative. E8 would be good though. BUT, F3 would be best, since it would not only kill white, but make your bottom group incredibly strong.]

This fight isn't over yet. Extending to S9 would be best, because you'd be guaranteed to live.

After running through the moves for the first time, the overall impression of this game was that you were too aggressive. Instead of trying to play your game, you tried to beat white's game. This is sometimes the right tactic, but you should have focused on developing yourself first, rather than trying to destroy white.

After going through the game a second time, I noticed that you need to work on making your stones work together more. Your influence moves early on in the game could have been much more effective if you made the stones work better together.

Be wary about placing stones next to an opponents. A Go proverb is "Contact strengthens both." So unless your sure that you need to touch an opponent, don't do it!

If you look at the final board, the white group on the upper left is a result of white playing under your 3-4 point and the L15 stone you played. You need to focus on developing good shape before trying to fight your opponent.

Like I said after my first run-through, make sure to focus on developing youself before you focus on destryoing white. You played too aggresively in this game, and it ended up destroying your position.

Also, you should work on joseki, fuseki, and some fighting strategies. Once again, I would recommend Google and Sensei's library. For improving fighting, www.goproblems.com has a ton of problems to help you better.

I just re-read the email and you said you felt like your fights went horribly wrong when you had the initiative. Having the initiative and having the upper hand are very different things. You were able to push white around, but this helped white to get stronger while it made your stones get disconnected.

Hope this review helped you!
