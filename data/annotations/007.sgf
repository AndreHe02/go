C[q3 is more usually  at r4.  After black approaches q3 at q5 he gets a good shape with the 4-4  stone in the upper right.  If W is at r4, B appraoches at P4, and doesn't get  the big moyo on the right side.]
;B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pn];W[nq];B[qj]C[When there is a black stone in the upper right, Q10 is more usual, planning  to make a big moyo on the right.  If the upper right is white, then either  Q10 or R10 is OK.]
;W[nc]
(;B[pf]C[When black has stone in the middle of the  edge (R10) he should pincer at M17 (see variation).  Usually white will  take the corner and black gets a nice wall facing the stone at R10.  Note  that if there is no stone at R10/Q10, Black should not pincer since white  will end with sente and could play there himself to nullify the wall.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fq]C[approaching from the other side at c6 is better, since it  makes potential territory in conjunction with the B stone at C16.  Since the  W stone at O3 is so solid, B can't make much territory on the lower side.]
;W[hq]C[Just playing C6 is good enough.  if B takes the corner at C3, the n  plays C10 after the joseki, W gets almost nothing.]

(;B[dr];W[cq];B[fo];W[dn];B[kp];W[ho];B[ip];W[hp];B[fm];W[eq]C[This move is not very good.  It gives  up sente for a small amount of corner territory.  Playing D8 get more, and  prevents B from bending around and making a wall facing his C16 stone.  If  you leave B with a weak line of jumps you may be able to cut at F4 later.
I guess you thought he would answer at E2 and you could cut now at F4.]
;B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[er];B[fr];W[dq];B[en];W[do];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl]C[A pretty bad  result from your E3 move since B is safe and thick now.  You should push once  at C8.  he will probably answer.  You can't afford to let him turn at C8 with  sente.  After you push once his turn at c9 is not sente.]
;W[kr]C[You might  consider running away with Wg6, Bf6, Wh8.  It may still be possible to attack  the big black group later, or to come out near n5 and attack the B stoens  around L4.]

;B[fn];W[in];B[jo];W[jn];B[ko];W[kn];B[mo];W[no]C[The main fight here  is between your H4 group and his J4 group.  Driving a wedge up like this O5  move to keep his stones separated would be a great plan if your H4 group were  strong.  But since you can't hope to capture his group, as he runs upwards it  will make your weak group even weaker.  Better to play to strengthen your  weak group - M6 or N6.  Your weak H4 group is a burden for most of the game  now.]
;B[ln];W[nm];B[ll];W[jk];B[kk];W[ij]C[You probably realize now that this  move should be at K8 or J8 so you won't get cut.]
;B[hm];W[hn];B[jl];W[il];B[im]C[If B peeps first at H9 instead ofplaying here, and W connects, W  could be in big trouble.]

;W[hh];B[ii];W[ih];B[ji]C[This pushing sequence By  white, csacrificing 3 stones, is pretty good.]
;W[eh];B[dh];W[eg];B[dg];W[ed];B[dc];W[ec];B[kq]C[The question here is "can B cut through at O6?"  If so,  the cut is probably bigger than L3.  if not, then W should play M2 now rather  than connect.  I don't think B can cut and kill the W stones, so W should  respond M2.  This is big in territory, and J2 is a cutting stone, although  chances of attacking the group to the left look slim now.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[nn];B[mp];W[ml];B[lm];W[np];B[lr];W[ph]C[Rather than invading, you could think  about pushing at K12, B-L11, W-M13.  This makes a big moyo at top.  You are  already into B's moyo at O7.]
;B[ok]C[how about just connecting at R12.  The W  stone will run away and B can take sente to invade the top.  Or if you want  to attack the W stone, just P10 rather than P9.]
;W[pl];B[ol]C[If you don't  plan to cut at Q7, you probably shouldn't push here.]
;W[om];B[ql];W[pm];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj];W[oj];B[nj]C[B could sacrifice 2 stones by playing Bp11, Wo11,  Bp12, and capture the invading W stone.  Since you have to come back and  connect after the atari, W can get away or live easily.]
;W[oi];B[nk];W[qi];B[ri]C[
 ychoi 5k*: are you there?];W[rh];B[pi];W[qh];B[oh];W[ni]C[You could think  about sacrificing these two stones and playing at W-P13, B-O12, W-Q13.  Then  you might be able to kill the upper right later, or at least wall it off  while it lives.  The wall works well with your upper side moyo, making it  pretty much territory.]

W has the opportunity now to start a huge ko with W-S8, B-T8, W-T9, but B is  thicker, so W probably can't win this ko.]

C[I guess you misread here and didn't see that  your two stones at H12 would be captured.  This move, leading to the two  stone capture, and B getting a stone at G12 is the start of your problems at  the upper side.

It looks like you are a little behind, so you need to find some way to invade  the left side, but I don't see anything better than just the monkey jump.   And you have a double sente at s5 that's pretty big.]

C[about now I bet you wished you had had time earlier to save the J2  stones...  You never know what you may end up attacking later, so always try  to keep those cutting stones alive.]

Not a good move becuase of the atari-descend sequence left for black.  Just  descend at G17 then connect at F18 if he pushes again.  F17 makes an empty  triangle, which is a clue that it might be bad.]
;B[mr]C[Since black has sente  now and is slightly ahead, he should win even if you played F17 at G17, so  the losing move was earlier.

B should take the double sente at S5..];W[nr];B[ns];W[os];B[ms];W[pr];B
[ro];W[rp];B[sp];W[sq];B[so];W[rq]C[Ah, I see B gotthe double sente anyway.  W  could have taken that move much earlier and the game would have been very  close.]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[gb]C[With this big capture the game is over.


As for style, W was willing to sacrifice stones when needed.  This was  effective in the center, but giving up cutting stones at J2 was too big.  And  giving up the two stones around J12 led to some connectivity problems.  B  missed some chances to sacrifice stones.


B was generally better at keeping sente.  He pretty much kept it from white's  invasion of the right side until this big capture.



W's one change to take sente was at move 158, so that was probably the losing  move.]
