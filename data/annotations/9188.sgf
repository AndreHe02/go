C[Hello :) I have been trying sanrensei fuseki nowadays. Generally, my main questions are about using moyo. I think, in this game, I did well on using moyo. But I try to find better moves.
And, in this game, I couldn't stop opponent while he was making territory on left and top side.
After one month, I will participate a tournament. I have to play more seriously. Please show me some solid moves !! :)
Thank you a lot.
(I am not native speaker. Sorry about my bad English :))];B[pp]
C[H: hello, my comments will start with this H. I'll try to focus on your sanrensei as you requested.]

(;B[jq]C[Is tenuki alright here ?

H: tenuki is definitely fine.could also try to approach the lower left corner at D5. See variation]
;W[pg]
(;B[qf]C[H: I would prefer R15. It solidly secures the corner and then you can attack with your mind at ease. see variation.]
;W[pf];B[pe];W[qg];B[rf];W[rg]
(;B[nh]C[H: O13 might be simpler, and it would help connect your stones at L13-L15. Plus you don't really need to kill this white group. You can let it wriggle and make a lot of cash in the process at the bottom. (see var for an example)]
;W[ng];B[mh];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni]
(;B[nj]C[H: Q12 first maybe? (see var)];W[mi];B[lh];W[mj];B[nk]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[qj];B[qk]C[H: Q12 first, definitely: you can't let white play Q11, as it's making eye shape in sente. (note that white should have played Q11 as soon as possible too)]
;W[pi];B[oj];W[qi];B[rk];W[rj]
(;B[kk]C[H: OK, this is an interesting move to comment on since you wanted a focus on sanrensei. sanrensei is about influence and moyo. It is not about capturing 4 stones in the middle of the board. You need to attack this group from afar. Play D5. Then you will approach the upper left corner somehow. If white spends moves protecting his center group, it's fine, white will not make any points there anyway. see var
+ see bonus variation];W[lf];B[kf]C[H: L15-L16 are only two stones and are not important since the upper side is already secure for white. You should concentrate on keeping white's groups separated, by playing N13 or N14]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[kl];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm]C[H: looks too slow to me. At least L6 would be better I think, or even K6 maybe. Also, at this point you should already be careful about your L14 group which has no eye. If white's L8 group gets out you may end up in trouble.]
;W[km];B[kn];W[mf]C[H: that move should ring an alarm bell. Your L15 group just became very lonely. But the good news is that white's L7 group still has no eye either. So what do we do in this situation? Strengthen our group while attacking the opponent's. n other words, attack the opponent's group with our weak group. see var]

(;B[pq]C[I want to make here safe territory. Is it early ?

H: based on what I just wrote at the previous move, yes it is early, because taking care of your weak group is more urgent. Also with all the moves already invested in the neighbourhood, it's kind of overconcentrated.]
;W[re]C[Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh]
(;B[rd]C[Right move ?
H: why not R15 to save your two stones?];W[qe];B[qd];W[sf];B[qb]
;W[jn];B[ko]C[H: please play the double hane at K5 here. This is way too solid/slow. Some would even consider the cut at K7.]
;W[jo];B[jm];W[jl];B[im];W[il];B[jp]C[H: I'd prefer H7 , to keep white groups separated.]
;W[hm];B[co];W[cm]C[Hmm, it is very hard to answer for me :)

H: yes it is. white has now made a huge moyo, including a large scale attack on your L15 group that you should have strengthened earlier.]
;B[dm]C[I didn't want to strengthen his left side.

H:if you make a contact play, you will automatically strengthen your opponent there]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[cp];B[do];W[bo];B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[cj];B[ck]
;W[bk];B[dj];W[ci];B[di];W[ch];B[fc]C[Late ? Early ?
Bad ? Good ?

H: what is the purpose of the move? Now is a good time to look at the overall situation.
1) Your L15 group is still in trouble with no eye
2) White's group in the center has no definite eye yet, though it has potential.
3) you just built a wall towards the center.
Conclusion : attack the white center group, starting with a move like J11 to help your L15 group.

H: I guess he could, yes];B[ig]
(;W[ii];B[hh];W[hg];B[ih];W[kj]
(;B[gg]C[H: again, what is the purpose of that move? Capture one stone? Now you can consider that L15 group is somewhat connected with D10. However all these stones have no eye yet. A good option would be to link everything at the bottom, while menacing white's center group. Around G5 or so.]
