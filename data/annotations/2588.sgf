C[Hi, this is a game I recently played in a tournament. I won in the end by resignation and I feel I am stronger than my opponent. However, in the beginning I was saved by luck. Then it became difficult for me to see whether I am in the lead and how big it is. After some aggressive play by my opponent I was on the verge of losing, and only and exchange and some misreading on his part gave me the win. So I would like to know how to play better when in trouble and how to keep a lead once ahead. Thank you!]

;B[jh]C[AB: The two ogeima moves (G11 and K12) really put my into trouble. I thought there must be some holes, but I could not expose them. Maybe I panic too much in these situations, but how can I play against overly aggressive players?

MP: Perhaps you can simply try to live as fast as possible. In the variation you get sente to build up your moyo. That is perhaps not a winning position but it is not a loosing either. Since your group is weak you have to accept that black can attack. In a way it is good for you that black attacks early because then you can adjust your strategy to the result.]

(;W[fi];B[fj];W[hd];B[ge];W[he];B[gf]C[MP: Conncting your big group is more logical than connecting to your invasion stones. One idea is to use a connection to easily slip out in the center sacrificing two stones which will remain as bad aji for the opponent to worry about.]

(;W[hf];B[gg];W[gh];B[hh];W[fh];B[hj];W[cc]C[MP: The fight has been very complicated all the way and one has to be a pro to know which moves are bad or good. But I think you played some clever moves here so I have not much to add.]
;B[be];W[ec];B[ed];W[gd];B[fe];W[fc];B[dc];W[db];B[eb]C[Here you played the "wild" move but that was also correct. I think it is possible to play safe too - but it will not give an easy win.]

(;W[bb];B[gc];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea];B[ic];W[cd];B[de];W[bf]C[AB: Now I have five liberties on the outside, my opponent has only four on the inside, so I capture him. But that was pure luck :-). Now I think I have the lead. But how big is it? Already time to resign for Black? He does have a lot of center influence...

MP: As black I would try invade and split up your stones - as much as possible. If you then kill another group I would resign - if not then anything can happen...]
;B[af];W[ag];B[ef];W[eg];B[qn]TR[gi][fj][hj][dn][jp][fq]C[MP: This is an opportunity to play safe. Any invasion on the lower side will mean trouble for you - so why not take territory there?]

(;W[pj]
(;B[on]C[MP: You are lucky here - black forces you to secure territory]
;W[np];B[qh]C[AB: He goes all out..., how can I keep cool :-)?

MP: This has to be expected.  The trick is to play cool move and not give black any opportunites to complicate matters.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[qi];B[pg]C[MP: Just capture and then live with the corner once for all.]

(;W[qg];B[oh];W[rh];B[oj];W[ph];B[hc]C[MP: Perhaps it is possible to resist and gain more liberties. Just an idea and requires careful reading.]

(;W[ae];B[qh]C[The next white move is in efficent.]
(;W[rj]TR[pk]C[This leaves an atari for later];B[lp]C[MP: Now the invasion is severe, since black was able to capture in the center.]
;W[mo];B[lo];W[mn];B[ln];W[ml];B[ol];W[lm];B[jn]C[MP: Perhaps you should aim at safety first. Safety also mean points for you in the endgame.  If your group is safe all your move will be sente. If your stones are weak black will take points in sente.]

(;W[fo];B[dr];W[gk];B[gj];W[jr];B[lr];W[or]
(;B[hp]C[AB: Very aggressive all over the place...

MP: This is logical. Your stones are thin

But Black was perhaps kind to you. It is too complicated to tell for sure what the best moves are but my feeling is that black should be able to invade successfully here. See the other variation for black.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[in];B[jm];W[hn];B[go];W[gn];B[fr];W[gq];B[lj]
C[AB: Now I'm not sure about my lead anymore. Black has quite something on the left and upper side.

MP: The last black move is slow - the upper right corner is  most important now. You should not try to kill any stones if you have a solid lead. If you play big points first you will kill groups in later because the opponent become frustrated....]

(;W[jl]C[MP: This move is crazy unless you have read out that the black stones are captured.

If you have time left you can count the score. If you are winning then play the largest endgame move. If this attack fails you will most likely lose some points and worse: the big white group will be weaker, unless you have read it all out.]
;B[im];W[il];B[hl];W[hm]C[AB: I tried to capture at least half of the group by cutting through L6. But here I suppose H9 would have been better.]
;B[kl];W[km];B[jo];W[ip]C[AB: I gave in (I also hallucinated, because I thought I could still cut off half of his group).]
;B[jk]C[AB: Now I'm not sure whether I have still the lead.]
;W[nc];B[mc]C[MP: Since black answers nice here this should be a won game now.]
;W[oc];B[mb];W[ne]C[AB: I was quite happy to get into the center.]
;B[oe]C[MP: See the variation for an idea how to resist blacks clever attempt.]

(;W[od];B[pe]C[AB: I missed that one...]
(;W[md];B[qe];W[ph]C[MP: Black should perhaps avoid the ko.]

(;B[ig];W[bd];B[qh];W[qd];B[re];W[ph]C[MP: If black connect safely as in the variation the white corner group might  die if white finishes the ko-fight.]

(;B[if];W[oi]C[AB: I obviously hesitated here, Black's threat is big. But all my stones are connected, so it is just 30+ points :-). Looking back I think this was the winning move, from now on the game went my way.]

;B[oa];W[qa];B[pb];W[qb];B[ma];W[pc]C[MP:

How does one win a won game? This is a difficult question. But keeping groups alive is a simple strategy. 

It is also important to count - for a long time you had a lead of over 20 points and you had the chance to play many moves that could have made the game simpler. Many of those safe moves were probably not even slow - because when your groups are safe the opponent will have problems in the endgame.

Becoming confident in counting and playing the endgame is important for tournament games.]
