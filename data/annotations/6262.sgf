C[Hi there!

I played this game on DGS. This game is short, black resign at the 36th move. But I will like a review in my fuseki and some others moves please.

----
Hi, I'm DooMeeR and I'll review this game. All my comments will begin with "----".

It is hard to find truly useful general comments about this game, because it is so short, and fuseki is harder to comment. But I'll do my best :)]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[qe];W[qj]LB[qe:a][kq:b][kp:c]C[----
I think this is both too low and the wrong direction.

Black's play at A is a nice extension for its corner stone. It encloses the corner well while already extending to the right side a little bit.

On the opposite, your move extends from the other direction. The territory it encloses is small because your two stones are too low.

A possible play instead could be to develop into the Chinese fuseki, by playing at B or C.]
;B[dj]C[I don't know if I could be played right...]
(;W[jp]
(;B[dm]C[----
I think playing around K16 is better for black, building a huge moyo.

If black wants to play in the D7 area, a play at C6 might be better (see variation).]
;W[fc]C[----
Ok, you approach his corner. But keep in mind that this leaves your own lower left corner weak, especially after black's play at D7.]
;B[db]TR[cf][cg][dg][df][hc][hd][id][ic]C[----
Here black could play around C14 / D13 to:
- answer your move and have an important stone when you invade the 3-3 (though now you can't invade it)
- extend from its stone
- prevent an invasion that would split him (the 3-3 invasion wouldn't split him, it would make him more influent)

Another possibility, if black likes to be more aggressive, is the pincer. With this pincer, blacks aims to build influence to extend its upper right corner while putting pressure on your approach stone. But it leaves the upper left open for an invasion, with 3 groups for black to defend (the corner, the pincer stone, and the two stones on the bottom left).

This move at D18 is ok too. It prevents the 3-3 invasion while enclosing the corner for territory. But the two left groups can be split, and this upper left enclosure cannot be extended well to the top because of the white stone.]

(;W[jc]C[----
By extending your stone like this you will make little territory and black can play around M16 or F15 to put pressure on your group, extend his own group and gain influence toward the center.

Or he can play D13 and hope for a lot of territory on the left.

See variation for another possibility.]
(;B[mc]C[----
I think this is a bit slow ; it puts less pressure on white group and gain less influence than M16, although with M16 white can settle more easily (with less influence toward the center).]
;W[cf]TR[df][dg][je][jj][ee][fe]C[C14 is a dangereous move? It's possible to kill it?

----
Well, C14 is between two black groups, and thus is already in trouble. It can hope to live small or to split the two black groups though.

However, you already have a weak group at F17 and K17 that will need help at some point. Your play at C14 allows black to try to put pressure on your two groups by playing around E15 or F15 while building influence toward the center.

Playing at D14 or D13 instead might be better. But it still leaves your white upper group weak.

Playing at F15 seems interesting too as it strengthens and extends your group while preparing for a more effective invasion of the left. But it allows black to play himself at D14 or D13 to defend against this invasion.

You might also consider K15 (to strenghen and extend the upper white group while also allowing it to run if needed) or K10 (to continue your moyo while building influence which might prove useful if your upper stones need to run).

All in all a difficult decision, which comes from the fact that your upper group is low (on the 3rd line).]

(;B[ce]C[----
Black can try to split your groups instead, making the battle harder for you, with 2 groups to make live.]
;W[cj]C[----
This attachment is a bit dangerous for you, especially because C14 is already attacked by C15. A play at E14 still splits black while making it more difficult for him to split your two groups (up and left). Here, you want to live directly, but you might live small if you do.]

(;W[cg];B[dh];W[ci];B[di];W[dl]C[----
Again, this tsuke creates weakness around C9.]
(;B[bm]C[----
This doesn't seem to be the best way for black to exploit your weaknesses. See variation.]
;W[bl];B[co];W[cp]C[----
White his happy to be forced to enclose the corner.];B[fm]C[----
Now black cannot invade the 3-3 and has to run (or to sacrifice his stones).]
;W[fp];B[qh]TR[oq][je]C[----
This extends black's corner and makes some points, but white can take a lot more by enclosing the lower right corner. So, black could invade instead.

He could also start to attack the two white stones at the top, on a large scale. The boshi (K15) might be possible.]
;W[qm]SQ[rk][rl][sl][sk][rm][sm][sn][rn][ro][so]TR[oj][ok][nj]
[nk]C[----
This is still quite low and slow: you make little territory on the right. Instead, you might consider playing around P10 to enlarge your moyo and build more influence toward the center (which could be useful to profit from the run of the black group at the bottom left if you decide to chase it at some point; or to rescue your stones at the top if needed).]
;B[jj]C[----
This move looks good, using his influence and making some more to help his stones on the lower left and attack your upper stones on a (very) large scale...]
;W[np]C[----
...but now you can take the last big point.];B[fb]C[----
You're small and weak on the upper side and black knows it. He wants to use all his influence and his stone at the center to enclose you. But before that he reduces your base.]
;W[gb];C[Result: W+Resign

So that it. Tamiko resign right this point. But I want so know more about this game please.

Thank you!

See ya!

----
I'm not sure why black resigns at this point. He might be able to use all the influence he has built to kill your upper stones. For this, he needs to chase them and push them in his influence against his wall.

If you do live though, black will indeed make little points as he doesn't have a lot of territory and can't make a lot in the center, wheras you have a lot on the bottom.

I hope you enjoyed my comments. Keep in mind that it is especially hard to comment on the beginning on a game and that a lot of what I said might be subject to discussion :)]
N[RESULT])
(;B[ck];W[dk];B[bi];W[bj];B[bg];W[ai];B[bf];W[cl]C[----
Black has sacrified two stones. In exchange, he has taken a (very) small territory, and has a nice wall if he wants to develop the center or attack your upper group.

He can still invade your 3-3.])
(;B[dk];W[ck];B[el];W[cl];B[em]C[----
Black has a very strong wall. He can use it to attack the two white stones at the top.]

(;W[bf];B[be];W[cm]C[I think this way better.

----
I'm not sure: white has many weaknesses that black can exploit. I continued the variation in one possible way where the result for white is awful.

Playing tsuke (attachment) is dangerous, and there is 3 pairs of white / black stones right here. This should be a hint for you: a lot of weaknesses can be exploited here, by both sides.]

(;W[fe]C[----
You can try that if you don't want your group to be too low (see move 14 for an explanation of why your low group leads to a difficult decision).

Black has the choice: let you invade, or let you take territory and influence with a nice shape.

Both choice will result in a simpler battle for you than your decision at move 14, I think.]

Black prevents the invasion. You have one more stone from which to extend, and you can extend further and higher.]

But black can both protect himself from an invasion around D8 and reduce white's potential extensions with this move, while building more influence and territory for himself.]

(;W[jc]C[...here and start an invasion there. Because The influence continues with R10 in my point of view and I could grow this K17 and go to direction of Q17 and don't let black grow much there and strong my group to center.

----
K17 and R10 are both low and quite far from each other (especially since black has a relatively strong group on the upper right).

This invasion prevents black from building a huge moyo. However, you can play on the bottom (as in the actual game) and build a big moyo yourself.

This invasion will likely allow black to strengthen his left group while trying to keep you small. Black could answer somewhere around F17.

Maybe K16 would be better. But I like your move at K4 in the game.]
