C[Hello adomasu!
I'm P, 4k and will be reviewing your game. Comments will be marked with P.

P: I think the main topic of this game is not, josekis or the "correct" fighting move, but rather a general "mis-direction" of play. There is seldom "the" move for the situation, like a joseki. Even josekis have branches where you could do either move and even if you deviate from the the joseki branch, the difference is not always large. Hence, there is always a trade. When you get more than your opponent, youll win. Try to focus on the thoughts on what do YOU want, and what might the Opponent want? BEFORE you start calculating sequences. This will give you a direction of play. Where are the weak groups, how can I benefit from them? Do I have weak groups which I have to secure? Do you want territory? or influence? I dont think that your opponent was superior, rather similar. You had several opportunities in the game to pull it around, even very late in the game. The B group in the center was not very healthy and the entire top area was under W influence. However, a collection of directional mistakes let to the loss. Try to be more flexible and think about what you want in the BIG picture, then try to make this come true by adjusting your local fights/decisions. And less josekis :D they tend to make you more inflexible if you learn them by heart :D 
Good luck.

Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking into this game, I hope it will be interesting for you. The whole game is a huge fight which starts with my opponentpicking a joseki that I've never played before, even in I knew the first couple of moves.
Most questions here are concerned with issues like "how secure is that group" which is of course very difficult to decide without calculation. Nevertheless, in your analysis try to focus on baisic principles and common shapes as well as the expectations that go with each move rather than complicated sequences that are hard to find in a real game.
Although my opponent was rated one rank lower than me, he seemed like a much stronger player. In the fight that ensued he completely demolished me. Other than the correct fighting moves, there is little else to talk about in this game. Please try to validate or correct my comments and assessments as I explain the thoughts which lead to the moves I played.
I resigned the game at move 151 after noticing that I'm dead, however clearly the game was over long before that. In particular I'm looking for a way to get out of that joseki which started everything, without getting into a huge fight.]

(;B[dj]C[P: no, this is ok. B could play the variation.  However, B wants to keep things flexible, thats why he overextends to D10 and leaves a potential weakness at C12. if W enters C12, B can take the corner as a trade. W does not need to answer this now, but needs to keep in mind that Bs position is still fragile and that Ws corner is still not secure.

is this normal? I was expecting black to appoach at c6 first, if he's going to do D10. In any case, I don't feel the need to respond locally. C8 comes to mind as a move but it doesn't seem urgent (and would probably end in gote for me if black responds) and also doesn't seem to strenghthen my bottom corner very much.]

(;W[po];B[pl]C[P: we shall see...but a little remark on josekis...I think people do say that one should only "know" josekis when at around 1k...Hence, unless you are low single digit kyu, you dont really need josekis to survive. To be honest, im terrible in josekis myself and dont "know" any of them really. What you do need to know is understanding the purpose of the moves...

And this is a joseki that I've never played before. I have no idea when black should play this as opposed to other pincers or what result I should expect. I guess I picked one of the more difficult joseki, since it was the only one I knew.]
;W[mp]C[P: What you really should ask yourself is, why did you played at N4? and not at R3, P3, O5 or N5? ...Again, try to find the reason of the move, and dont play it because "the others play it too". Thats a bad habit and will worsen your playstyle.]
;B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[pp];B[oq];W[qq];B[qr];W[op];B[np];W[nq]
;B[nr];W[mq]C[P: And thats how one should NOT play a joseki, by heart. All moves have a meaning, knowing the meaning of the moves is superior than learning josekis by heart, as that experience will help you in other situations also. Just learning josekis can be a trap for yourself, as the situation on the board can give you a reason why NOT to play after a joseki.

here I don't know the joseki anymore.];B[nn]C[P: I think thats not necessary. S2 works for W, ref variation. B does not need to throw in Q2 like in the actual game. 

I wanted to secure the corner and played a forcing sequence that's probably bad, however I'm afraid of black taking away my base there.]

(;W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[ps];W[rp]C[P: As you can see, your variation from the standard joseki is only slightly different. Its not uncommon that deviations from josekis only give a slight advantage/disadvantage, as a joseki represents the "perfect" balance between B/W. Another reason to understand the moves, rather than learning josekis.

ending in gote but securing the corner. Black could now attack my 3 stones on the other side.]
;B[om]C[I decide that I can play sente moves against black's group and get a base on the bottom that way.]
;W[mr];B[ns];W[rs]C[P: Better not played. W is alive, so is B. This is a wasted ko-thread]
;B[qs]C[Now I play a blunder. The correct move is probably J3, at least that's what I think now. I thought connecting the stone at P6 would be sente because black has many cuts. That is not the case though.]
;W[pn]C[P: Nope, this is not sente to black. If you mean O7, that cut is not a very good one. and B on both sides is strong, even after the cut. J3 would have been better, you are right.]
;B[jp]C[P: I think you can do either. the 4 W stones are not dead yet,

black is going to attack me severely. I decide that I should try to fight here, since black still has many cuts. Not sure how viable of an option it would be to give up those 4 stones with a move like h3...]

(;W[lo]C[P: This seems slow.  ref variations.];B[mm];W[lm]C[trying to get out]
;B[fq]C[P: I think this is kind of wishy-washy from B. and leaves a weakness at H3 to complicate the issue. B should have played G3 to stabilise its group against the fleeing W group.

here I decided that I might be able to give up the corner and get the bottom instead. This might be wrong judgement, since the K4 stone is hard to catch.
Hence my move might be an overplay. However now that I've commited to running that group out I wanted to try helping it without giving black loads of profit.]
;W[hq]C[P: This is actually not easy for B to handle.]
(;B[cn]C[P: very flimsy again of B. 

I was surprised by this move. In any case this will position will become a big fight. The subsequent moves I'm very much at a loss what to do.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[ep];W[fo];B[eo];W[eq]C[I take the bottom hoping that I'll be able to either attack black's stones in the area or connect underneath.]
;B[dq];W[er]C[P: Yes it is better to take the stone

not sure if taking is better. Probably it is.];B[dr];W[fr];B[cp]
C[P: Yes it is. When you look at the situation now, W's plan to give up the corner went actually well. they outside area is bigger than the corner. In addition the initial fleeing W group has become very strong and W has no sorrows. It is definetely possible to catch the stones and secure the entire bottom. 

Now is my chance to seal catch those two stones. Not sure if that's possible and also not sure if the result is good enaugh, even if I manage to do that. However I fail and the rest of the game is basically both of us trying to kill each other.]
;W[hn]C[P: That is the wrong direction! Terrible! there is no danger from that side! K6 would be better.]
;B[kn]C[P: B at K6 would be more dangerous for W]
(;W[ln]C[P: Yes, your variation is better.

Maybe I shouldn't connect here.];B[kr]C[P: No, I think W can still fight.

Maybe I should let black connect here and escape? That way black is very much ahead on territory though.]
;W[ms];B[jm]C[P: W is really in trouble now.];W[jl]CR[jm][kn]
[jp][kr]C[P: I think shape is not so much of a problem. But you should rather think more about what you or your opponent actually wants from that situation. W wants to get out. easy and uncomplicated. M9 would do it. K8 announces an attack on the circle stones, and complicates the issue. 

Fighting is my weakest aspect in go. Never know what moves and shapes are right.]
;B[im];W[km];B[jn];W[hm]TR[jl][km][lm][ln][lo][mp][mq][nq][mr]
[ms]C[P: wrong direction! The triangle group is still not out of danger! The ladder at L8 does not work for W and W should steer its weak group out of danger first. with maybe L9]
;B[il];W[io]TR[hm][hn][fo][fp][eq][gq][hq][er][fr]C[P: This is good depending on WHY you want to catch G4...If you want to "catch a stone" then its the wrong answer. But if you did it because you can settle the triangle stones in sente, then its right...

catching g4 in sente];B[kp];W[nl]C[P: No, he doesnt. still. W's group still needs to run away. 

bad move by me. Black need not connect];B[ml];W[lk];B[nk];W[en]
C[P: Those two stones do absolute nothing! there is nothing to attack!

Trying to attack black's heavy group. Maybe those two black stones aren't big enaugh though and black should tenuki here.]
;B[do]C[P: W was lucky that B reacted...];W[el]C[P: Running away with the center W group is still more important. E8 destroys some points for B (if there were any) but doesnt get W a lot of points. The center group is critical, as it has no eyes.]
;B[kl];W[ll];B[jk];W[li]C[P: You should have! long time ago!

Now I'm scared that I might die];B[lg]C[P: Maybe a little bit drastic...peep on N10 then O12 might be enough. attacking and making territory at the same time]
;W[nj]
(;B[ok]C[black should be more agressive here];W[oj];B[pj]C[P: Yes, thats the price of having a weak group.

it seems I'm about to give the whole right side to black without actually getting eyes in exchange.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[og];W[nf];B[oe];W[jh]C[P: Not M13 no, the only way to turn this game is to kill the the centre black group. Not even sure that might be enough. 

hoping to either eat M13 and make comfortable life or kill black's heavy group in the center.]
;B[cd]C[P: Stop thinking about josekis...just play go :) I have not calculated through, but I think B is in trouble with H10...The centre group is not fully alive yet.

Black decides that he's fine. Also I don't know the joseki here, in any case playing in the fight seems more urgent. I respond reluctantly certainly intending to end in sente there to attack black.]

(;W[cc];B[bc];W[ce];B[bd];W[df]TR[he][ch]C[P: No, not necessarily. Again, what do you want? This move starts claiming the marked areas. Since the top is not contested by B, I think W has still a chance. but has to do a lot to catch up to B.

No idea what I'm doing here. That's probably a bad move.];B[be]
C[and now I tenuki.];W[fj]C[P: not aggressive enough against the central right group. Note that it has one eye already, W has therefore to be tougher than that.]
;B[ii];W[ih];B[gi]
(;W[fi];B[hh]C[Maybe I missed my chance to wedge?];W[hj];B[hi]
C[P: G10 is wrong. there was a possibility to cut at J10. ref. variation.]

(;W[gj]C[P: You missed the chance to cut B and kill the centre B group! check out the variation!

this might be too slow. The outside is more important. It is threatening to cut though.]
;B[ji];W[kh]C[But black's obvious resonse also threatens to cut me, so I end in gote...]
;B[fh]C[and now black seems fine]
(;W[eh]C[P: Yes, i think so. ref variation.

Should have played the peep.];B[fg];W[de]C[P: True....

small and not urgent. Terrible move by me];B[hf]C[P: Yes...and B is also living inside the area where W could have made massive points...ref the earlier variation with H13...

now black is perfectly fine, especially since he can make one eye at the bottom (?!)]
;W[kk]C[P: Yes, its quite over.

This move does nothing. I thought it's helping my eye shape but that's not the case. I should try to attack m13 and get ahead. Even if I could manage that, the game is already lost beyond any hope.]
;B[hd];W[jf];B[je];W[ke];B[jd];W[le];B[lc];W[qc]C[I misread thinking I can make 2 eyes and died shortly after this. Thank you for looking at this game. Looking forward to your comments.]
