C[Xinwen :::

hello, my name Xinwen,your reviewer of this game.

However some of the comments have been made by my friend as well, so you will have more answers to your questionable moves.

[oe:A]C[click "A" for black's variation

B is the original move]
(;B[kc]TR[pd]C[When i played L17 did i create a weakness that my opponent didn't see or was it an ok move?

Q16 has made a empty traingle for white causing white shape to be more heavy. Instead of playing Q16 for white, he should play at Q14, extension.

Q14 is actually a joseki for white, since he play out of joseki, black can do something better here 1st before conducting an extention on L17 spot. Lets see the variation.]
;W[oe]C[Should white have made that move instead of jumping?

The answer is yes, this is a good result for white if he playes, the previous variation has shown how b should play before white conduct this move. P15 tends to push black and slowly reach out to the middle.]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[me];W[of]C[After that push, white base became more comfortable.]

(;B[rp]C[Should i have played R4 instead of this?

S4 should not be a problem, You are expecting white to play R3 now so you can tenuki (ignore and play other spot) and gain  more territory at others place.

Lets see what happen when you play R4];W[qq];B[dj]C[B indeed tenuki, this spot was very good to be play. Black whole board influences was huge. Can tell easily b is leading here alot.]

Xinwen :::

Notice your games are abit overconcentrated on one side and the other side? This usually resulted a Moyo aka. Frameworking game where you compete the size of territory with your opponent.

Normally, this is rather boring, that is why stronger player tend to "Corners" first, where colours or stones are spread throughout the 4 corners then started to fight for side then lastly to center.]

;B[ar];W[ch]C[Was there a different area of invasion white should have made?

Hmm good question. Its a very good question, but i rarely seen some1 around 15kyu and below asked. If i said no, they will say but but  B is too strong, and there seems alot of empty space down there. Or they give me the answer, maybe he would made mistake and let me live, lols, this possibilities is high for lower kyu, in higher kyu, they can kill it easily. And sometimes you need to see how stronger player play, try to understand it. it would be a great help

Yea, but, always bear in mind, its your fault to let your opponent have such a big moyo due to a bad starting off by you (well ofcourse the you ehre is not refering to you).]

OVERALL, the game is alright, more room to improve
just try to watch how strong players player !])

I don't like the move by my friend B12, because if the white would really want to live there is no way white would make the shape heavier
