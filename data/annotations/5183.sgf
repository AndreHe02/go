C[Hi, in this game I played white and captured some groups 
of my opponent in the early game. But my opponent 
gained a lot of influence to the middle. So I started to run 
from the other side to middle too to prevent him from 
making too much territory. But I'm afraid I made some 
mistakes doing so and lost the game because of these. 
Please show me how to do better.
Thank you in advance.

Hi, my names Amar and i play on KGS as forgottenm as 
11k. Your game seemed pretty good but i think you should 
look for bigger moves in the opening and try to keep a 
balance between territory and influrence. Your yose was 
okay but thats not really important i think right now :P.
Good luck later, hope to see you bye!];B[qp]C[Asroc [18k\]: hi good game]
;W[pd];B[cp]C[tigrou49 [18k\]: hi gg];W[dc];B[kq];W[de]C[this move seems slow compared to blacks chinese 
opening
it also leaves a weakness for black to play c13 because 
of both stones being on 4th line];B[kc];W[mc]C[good attacking]

;B[es];W[fr];B[hp];W[iq];B[cn]C[Until here I had captured some territory in the lower left 
area. But my opponent has build his first thick wall.
Watching it now after a few days, I wonder if it had been a 
good idea to attack L3. How could I have done it? Bye 
playing N3?

L3 seems to early you might jump out in centre or play c10 
which seems biggest because of your high stones in top 
left and blacks wall which you played :)]

;B[oq]C[But now my opponent has a lot of influence, so I decide to 
prevent him from turning it into too much territory by 
running into the middle from my upper rigth stones.

good idea];W[nj];B[mg];W[le];B[nl];W[lj];B[kg];W[je];B[id]
(;W[jg]C[Is this an example for the rule: Don't touch stones you are 
attacking? Should I have played J13 instead? It would 
have been very loosely connected. I think it hadn't 
worked. What do you think?
its hard to explain but there are times when you can touch 
stones you are attacking but i think its only when your sure 
its going to die, anyways ur attacking from wrong side now 
a play at k11 or so would be better 
you might also cut and run with black kind of];B[jh];W[jf];B[kh]
;W[jj];B[hh];W[fo]C[I think this was the decisive stone, that made me loose. 
The solely fact that a ladder doesn't work, doesn't make it 
a good idea to cut. Both black groups have no problems 
to stay alive and the stone is surrounded by black groups.
this is a pretty pointless move but black responded with a 
small move. you should of just kept going into blacks moyo]

(;B[cl]C[Now my stones are dead. An unnecessary overplay. They

close game, these points have probably decided the 
game.

;B[jp]C[Here I hoped to capture the stones around M12 or at least 
some of them, but my opponent answered the L10 stone 
correctly.

nice reading it but instead of filling in ko stone u could of 
atari p15 and kept going the ko at l11 is really great for 
you unless he reads it after you play which then you only 
get two stones
he might also play ko at 015  but that ko looks bad for 
black also unless white's ko threat is like one point]
