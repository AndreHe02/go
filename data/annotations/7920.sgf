S: My name is Saurus, and I will mark my comments with an "S"
I am 6 kyu on KGS, and I hope you will find my comments useful.

I have been asked to review the game for white, and I have therefore restricted my review to the white moves.

I have indicated wherever I have given variations.

On the last move of the game, I have given a summary of what you should do to improve. I have given the main themes that need improvement, as well as seven specific areas that need work.

Enjoy the review!    :)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[np]
C[D: O3 is the usual approach

S: Actually, w-O17 is the usual approach. Black has played the Chinese opening. The aim of this opening is to expand his moyo in the bottom right corner, forcing you to invade/reduce there, and the profit from chasing your invading group around the board. Your strategy should be to avoid the  invasion for as long as possible, by playing away from that corner, and building up strength elsewhere, in order to asist with your invasion later. 

Let's consider the white stones on the board...
D4 is flexible, being on the 4-4 point, so we leave it alone for now.
D17 is inflexible, being a 3-4 stone, and a play from this stone is urgent. A 3-4 stone has only two purposes:
1) To make territory with a shimari (c15)
OR
2) To extend along the top, making territory there. Since it is a low stone, black will not easily invade the top, but will be forced to try and reduce you later, giving you solid territory.

Therefore, we want to find a two purpose move - extend along the top and approach a black stone. O17 is ideal for this purpose.

Thus w-o17 is standard.

There is a serious problem with O4 that needs to be addressed. W-O4 makes no territory, since black can slide underneath it. Therefore, you must have played it for inluence. What does influence mean? It means that you are preparing to fight and attack. Problem is that after b-q5, black's corner is unkillable, meaning that you have no target. Rather, o4 will itself bocome a target, being so close to black's corner fortress.

LESSON 1: Play stones with a specific purpose in mind.
Before each move, you need to make the following decision... Will my stone make territory, or will I use it to attack?
-If it will be used for territory, where will my final territory be? If you cannot clearly see where the territory will be, don't play it.
- If it will be used for attack, what will it attack? If you have no target in mind (current or future), don't play it. 

LESSON 2a: Don't attack stong groups. 
Black will live in the corner, no matter what. What on earth are you doing playing an influence (attacking) stone near a group that will live easily?)

W-O17 threatens to make corner along the top, so it has purpose. Furthermore, it is sente, because if black does not protect his q16 stone, white will attack it. Therefore, it was a much better move.]
;B[po]C[S: Now o4 should be trembling.];W[nn]C[S: OK, at least this move is consistent with the idea of playin a high stone. It is in preparation for a black play along the bottom. The idea will then be to pince the black stone from the left, pushing it against these two stones, thereby making territory on the left.

Problem is, it comes at a heavy price, since black will have a lot of territory in the corner, while you still have none. So now the strategy must change. You have given black lots of territory, while building your own moyo, so you must force black to invade the bottom, and then chase it aggressively, making even more territory than black has in the bottom left corner as a result.]
;B[pm]
(;W[jq]SQ[kp][lp][mp][mo][lo][ko]C[S: NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Black can no longer invade the bottom. Your two stones have just become useless.

Take the two stones away. How much territory do you lose? Only the six marked points (black can still slide underneath. Those two stones are worth only three points each.

Consider the variation instead, for how to use the two stones effectively.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[cn];W[fq]C[S: The low position of k3 means f3 can (and should) safely be played at f4, which results in more territory.

If k3 was absent, the low move is fine.];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[ce]
C[S: Excellent move!

Allowing a black approach to this stone would have been a disaster.]
;B[pf]C[S: Black is preparing to fight for the top.];W[nc]TR[jc]
C[D: Way too far, M17 or K16 should have been better no ?

S: DON'T APPROACH STRONG GROUPS!!! NEVER! EVER! NO EXCEPTIONS! EVER!

Black and white have both prepared to fight for the top. Why not share it, taking a little more than black. 
W-k17 or W-k18 would have been ideal for this purpose. White takes slightly more than half, and black has to be content with m-17.

LESSON 2b: Never approach a strong group.];B[oc]
(;W[ob]LB[jd:A]C[D: Again a mistake, i have to learn more josekis !

S: Learning josekis is not the best option. Better to reason the moves out. It will give you a much better understanding of the game than learning joseki.

W-p18 forces black to completely solidify the corner with b-q18. It also leaves a cutting point at o18.
Therefore, the hane is not ideal.

Playing nobi at w-o18 allows b-o16 - not good for white.
Playing nobi at w-o16 allows b-j17 - also not good for white.

Therefore, we must find another option.

W-k16 would be the ultimate extension from the corner shimari, and also an extension from o17.
Definitely better than in the game.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[pb];W[nb];B[ic]C[D: Really hard !

S: Yes, you're one move behind, since you approached a strong group.]
(;W[gd]LB[kc:A]C[S: Wrong side. This pushes black towards your weak white group, making it weaker.

LESSON 3: Always push black from your weaker side towards your strength.

This is a very important concept in Go.

[SEE IMPORTANT VARIATION\]];B[ie]C[Black let you off the hook. After b-m17, your three white stones are in trouble.]
;W[me]C[D: I'm already running in despair, this game doesn't start really well !

S: Knights moves can be cut. 

LESSON 4: If you're running to live, always use one-space jumps or solid connections.]
;B[kd];W[mg];B[jg]
(;W[ph]C[S: What is q12 doing???

You're stuck in a battle with a handful of men against a might army of black soldiers in black's own territroy and you're picking fights?

LESSON 5: Attack when you are strong. Defend when you are weak.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[og];W[oh];B[oe]C[D: I think this is useless for black, O9 or something around D12 seems much bigger

S: Yes, black should have ripped you apart by attacking your knights moves.]
;W[qg];B[qf];W[pj];B[pk]
(;W[oj]C[S: Perhaps w-o10 was better.

[SEE VARIATION\]\]];B[gf];W[dh]C[S: What on earth do you want to attack with that high stone?

Make territory with w-c12.];B[ci];W[ch];B[bj];W[fm]C[D: Finally a good move no? i think this stone goes very well with the bottom

S: Yes, a move with a purpose!   ;)];B[ij]C[S: Black's only aim is to destroy the potential territory in the middle.

Black is ahead, so he wants to destroy whatever potential territory exists on the board. Not a bad idea, but it does give you sente.]
(;W[gh]TR[ij][jg]SQ[ck][cn]C[D: Here, i want to connect with the bottom group cutting the 2 blacks groups. Is this the right way ?

LESSON 6a: Don't connect living groups!
LESSON 6b: Don't cut living groups!

Lesson 6a and 6b are well known proverbs.

Both black groups and both white groups are alive. Either connecting or cutting living groups simply wastes stones.

Better to play a territory-making move such as w-j7. After all, the person with the most territory at the end wins, no?

In fact, after w-j7, white has equalized in territory again.

Besides, it is your top right group that needs connecting.

[SEE VARIATION\]];B[hh];W[gj]C[S: Same comment. Simply ignore black and take territory.]
;B[ej];W[ei];B[di];W[fi];B[nl]C[S: Yes black now cashes in on your failure to protect this group. You are in trouble.]
;W[lm]C[S: Why try and make territory now, when you need to be fixing your weak top right group?

Territory should have been made already , and you should now be running.]
;B[kj];W[lk]C[S: Good.];B[jl];W[jm];B[kl];W[km];B[ll]C[S: I don't get it. You have played a few moves to connect your group, and now you simply let black cut you apart. If you were going to allow this, then you should rather have spent the previous few moves making life for your weak group.

W-m8 was the only move.

LESSON 7: Play consistent moves.];W[lj];B[im]C[D: Black is really reducing my territory, quite hard for me

S: Don't worry about a few points of territory when the whole game is on the line with a life/death problem.]
;W[in];B[hm];W[hn];B[gl];W[fl];B[mm];W[mn];B[en];W[dm]C[D: Cutting, cutting but should i have settled my top left corner first ? Or my O18 group  ?

S: Protecting your o18 group was the ONLY way to play.];B[cm]
;W[dn];B[dl];W[em];B[ef]C[D: Good point for black

S: If white had not played there rather than black, you would only have three points more than you do now. Nothing to worry about.]
;W[hi];B[ih]C[S: Black did not have to respond.];W[ii];B[ji]
;W[co];B[bo];W[gk];B[hk];W[gm];B[hl];W[hj]C[D: How horrible just telling black : "Be carefull guy, your group isn't settled !"
 Bottom right or top left is much more important and bigger!

S: Absolutely!];B[jk];W[df];B[nr]C[D: Ouch !

S: Yes. See comment on move 6.];W[mq]C[D: :'(, so bad];B[ls]
;W[kr];B[mr];W[lr];B[nq];W[lp]C[D: Take that you just lost 10 points ! :(]
;B[fe];W[fd];B[gb]C[S: Here again (and bottom right), a good demonstration of how a fourth line stone makes no territory.]
;W[fb];B[gc];W[kb]C[S: Better late than never!  ;)];B[md];W[nd]
;B[le];W[mf];B[rg]C[black O15 seems really important no ?

S: Absolutely. After b-o15, the game is over.];W[rh]C[S: But why did you not protect against o15?]
;B[pg];W[qh];B[sf];W[lc]C[S: Finally!   :)

Excellent move. The miai connection is better than simply connecting at o15.]
;B[ri];W[rj];B[qj];W[qi];B[rk];W[si];B[jb];W[ld]C[S: This is the type of unnecessary 'scared' move you must avoid. You are connected, because you can play this any time if black cuts at o15 and vice versa.

Rather take sente and play big moves like q19 and b3.];B[ke]
;W[hd];B[id];W[fc];B[bq];W[br]C[D : This is costing me the game]
;B[cp];W[dr];B[do];W[eo];B[ep];W[co];B[ln];W[kn];B[do];W[ik]

;B[do];W[pp];B[op];W[co];B[bh];W[do]C[D: And here, i aws running out of time and didn't see any ko threat so i filled but it cost me more than 15 points !

S: W-r18 was an option.

The rest of the game is pretty straightforward. Go to the end of a game for a summary of what you should do  to improve.]

[cr][er][fr][gr][hr][ir][jr][cs][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is]C[Saurus: All in all, this was a pretty good game.
It was also a nice game to review, because it is blatantly clear which principles you are missing...

Focus on improving on the 7 specific areas which I have summarized as "lessons". Scrict adherence to these principles will increase your play dramatically:

LESSON 1: Play stones with a specific purpose in mind.

LESSON 2: NEVER approach or attack a strong group. 

LESSON 3: Always push black from your weaker side towards your strength. ie. If black plays between two of your groups, always play on the side of your weaker group.

LESSON 4: If you're running to live, always use one-space jumps or solid connections.

LESSON 5: Attack when you are strong. Defend when you are weak.

LESSON 6: Don't connect or cut living groups!

LESSON 7: Play consistent moves.

In order to improve your fuseki, you need to consider the purpose of each stone, and decide WHERE it will make territory, or WHAT (current or future) the stone will attack, if it is an influence stone. Having a purpose for each stone in mind is the key to getting stronger. Don't simply play a high stone because it looks good. You should have a specific purpose for that high stone. Otherwise, rather play a territory stone.

To implement your plan, most importantly of all, make sure never to approach or attack strong groups. If you do ever approach, attach, cut or connect a strong group, stop, smack yourself on the head, and remind yourself that, above all,  it is this aspect of your play which is holding you back.

There were at least 15 moves in this game where you fell into the trap of playing near to a strong group.

I hope you found my comments useful, and expect to see you soon in the single digit kyus!
