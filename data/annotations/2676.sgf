C[Hi, i hope you can give me some advices, so that i can improve my play, i am about 17k in IGS, my opponent 19k. Thanks in advance.]

Ok with me. Further consideration would require dan level to be effective]

Though not unacceptable, it is better with the right lower corner being white]

Balanced, but the P5 wall should be turned into advantage with a play at R13.

I think you played nicely.
Overall, you deserve probably better than 17 k

However, it is difficult to assert where you could improve, because there was such stake at reading tsumego issues on the board that this could have turned the game around several times.

Hope this helps.
