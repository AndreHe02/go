C[laver: Hi, in this match I am black.
I present you many of the thoughts I had during the match, hoping to give you some idea on what to comment about.
Anyway, I will appreciate particularly comments not related to my considerations. New ideas are the best way to impreve oneself.
I am interested in comments about both sides.];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd]
C[laver: D16 aims at D5...];W[pp];B[do]
(;W[cm]C[laver: white's pincer is good for me. The usual joseki (See variation would be painful for white.

This pincer is probably a mistake.  I can't find ANY pro games where it was played. In almost all pro games white attaches underneath.]

(;B[fo]C[laver: bad for black, since white can connect at C5.

The one point jump is not the correct move here.  If black wants to run out into the center, the diagonal move is correct.]
;W[ep]C[Black should thank white for making these stones thick. Now the connection underneath doesn't work.]
;B[eo]
(;W[gq]C[laver: black welcomes the peep. Now white is separated.
Perhaps white is better in the variation I propose, ain't?]
;B[ck]LB[dl:a][el:c][em:b]C[laver: Black has to settle its heavy group. It's clear to me that the best way to do it is to attack the white isolated stone. But maybe a, b or c are better.
Any criterion for assessing them? I know very little about shapes. Could you give me any reference to some material dealing with shapes?

First of all, the black group isn't heavy, it is thick.  I like to think of the strength of a group in term of the number of resources it has.  The D5 black group can attach under the D3 stone to make a base (1 resource) it can jump into the center at H5 or e7 (2 resources)  or it can attach to the B7 stone to run out into the center (1 resource) or it can attach to the G3 stone and run along the 4th line.  Groups with 1 resource are are VERY weak, with 2 resources, a little weak, with 3 resources they are neutral, with 4 or more resources, a group is strong.]
;W[em]C[laver: This is why I don't like C9. Black is split in two, and is very heavy. A search for a base is urgent.

As I said, the black group isn't weak, it is strong.  Not need to start defending now. Keep up the attack.]

(;B[cn];W[cl];B[cq]C[Black shouldn't ignore the contact play against the C9 stone.]
;W[cr];B[bq];W[br];B[dp];W[fp];B[aq]C[laver: bad move, A2 is sente.]
;W[bk]C[laver: Black has no hope of doing anything good here, so tenuki is better. I did realize it one move later...]
;B[cj];W[bj];B[jd];W[go];B[fm];W[ek];B[gn];W[ho]LB[cf:a][df:b]
[pj:c][qn:d][nq:e]C[laver: Now the sequence is ended: Black's group can either escape in the center or make a base, so there is no urgency in developing it.
So, what to do next?
I see 5 possible moves.
Usually I prefer to approach suddenly, since I am a low kyu player, so I am not able to foresee any development of my opponent's huge frameworks.
So, I prefer not to let them make such frameworks.
It's just a question of fear, but I know nothing about pros and cons about behaving this way. Any idea?

The bottom side isn't so big. White needs one more move to make it into territory, though so now might be a good time to invade. Right now white's area looks bigger than blacks so black should reduce.  If black were bigger, it would be better to expand.


So, between e and f, I preferred e in order to prevent white from making the whole lower side.
But maybe d is better (see variation)]
(;B[nq]C[I think this is OK.];W[lq];B[qq]
(;W[qp]C[This is the wrong direction.];B[pq];W[op];B[nr];W[qf]
C[laver: white plays tenuki, leaving a weakness, but where? K3? N4? O4?

That depends on how the right side develops. N4 looks OK.

Anyway, now he threatens Q10, so a pincer is a must, I think. Also, a pincer works well with K16.

I agree that a pincer looks good here.  I might play R10.];B[pi]

(;W[qi]C[laver: not joseki!

Definitly not.  This fight should be good for black.];B[qj]
;W[qh];B[pj];W[nc]
(;B[nd]C[This looks like the wrong direction to me. This white stone is weak, and there is no reason to make it stronger.]
;W[md];B[oc]C[I wouldn't play this way.  I would try to keep white separated.]
;W[ne];B[od];W[mc];B[rd];W[ph]C[laver: I think black is good here. White has two wek groups, and K16 is in a wonderful position.]
;B[oh]C[laver: but black here is definitely wrong: he should keep white's groups separated (P14)]

C[laver: Now white is good: Black is sealed in the corner, and still has to take care of his weak group facing white's wall.]

(;B[qm]C[This should be at R6 to put more pressure on the P4 group.]
;W[rl]C[laver: White makes advantage of his thickness, here. I think it's good.

I don't know that the P4 group is thick.];B[ql];W[rm];B[rk]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[ro];B[sq];W[oq];B[or];W[rp];B[np]C[laver: Is that the good move? I think it's unbearable for black to get sealed in this corner, too.

It looks good to me.  The P4 white group still doesn't have two eyes.]

;B[mn];W[nn]C[laver: White's thickness is impressive.
But black is in advantage in term of territory, and he has the two strong stones at the top.
I think the game is open, now.

The two stones on the top are not at all strong.  The K16 stone is too close to the white thickness.]
;B[df];W[fc]C[laver: I think black has to exploit his advantage in the corner to get a strong position. White will attack thanks to his thickness. Next moves are crucial.]
;B[fd]
(;W[gc]C[laver: Nooo! While white is making solid territory, black is being split, and K16 loses most of its value, being under attack. Perhaps a pincer would have been better, rather than F16.]

;B[de];W[eh];B[fg];W[ei];B[bf];W[fh]C[laver: Now iose begins. Aother huge problem I have: how to assess how big moves are. If you have any hint, please tell me :-)

If I could tell you that, I would be a lot stronger than I am.  At this point, it looks like White has about 10 in the top left, 15 on the left side, about 25 at the bottom and a few in the center
 for a total of about 50.  black has maybe 10 in the upper left, 13 in the upper right, about 7 on the right side, about 8 in the lower right and about 6 in the lower left, for a total of about 35.  Right now I can't see how black can catch up 15 points.  There isn't really anywere that black can expand.]

I think the game got out of hand when black played O16 and made white get strong in blacks main area.  Had the two white groups been separated, black could have developed the top.  Black started off with three star point on the top, but got almost no territory or thickness there.]

This side of the board is small after the R8 play.  I would probably just play R14 to expand my area on the top.]
