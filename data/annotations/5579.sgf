C[I commented a few decisions and some mistakes I made. I hope you can show me some other mistakes.

Maybe you can give me some advices how to improve my game.

bye bye :)

It's from IGS so it's converted to SGF with MultiGo

Degan:  The SGF file listed both your ranks as "BC".  This caused a problem for CGoban2 (which I am using) so I eliminated it.  It does not give me any information of your relative ranks.

It is good to make comments in your game for the reviewer.  I would suggest even more, especially expand upong what your purpose was in making the move.]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[cp];W[qd];B[dj];W[ce];B[jp];W[qn];B[oo]LB[np:B]
[nq:A]SQ[pj][qj][pk][qk]C[Degan:  A or B are more common than your move at circle.  Your move seems to over emphasis the center of the board.  I would expect it to nearly force a response by whit on one of the square spaces, which is good for white.]
;W[pk];B[jd];W[jc]LB[ic:A][kc:B]C[Degan: This attachement is too bold, an overplay by white, punish it with A (or B).]

(;B[id]C[Degan: Too weak a response by black.  Se previous comment.]
;W[gc];B[ic]SQ[jc]C[mistake? i wanted to cut his territory into two parts.

Degan: The one stone at square is not territory.  Yes , your move (circle) cuts the squar stone from the secure territory by white on the upper left corner.  However, it also creates a weak group (three balck stones) that needs some help.]
;W[nc];B[ff]LB[ge:A]SQ[gc]C[Degan: This is good.  It loosely connects to the three stones and helps seal-off white's corner.  With white's marked stone, I prefer A.]
;W[kc];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[qg];B[qf];W[pd];B[pe]LB[of:B][pf:A]
C[Degan:  Unusual.  This is good in that it helps protect against the cut at A, but does not help against the peep at B.  See variation.]

(;W[ch];B[dh]SQ[id][jd][pe][ff][pg][ph][dj][oo][jp]C[Degan:  Very good consistancy in play by black. Black wants the center of the board.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[eq];B[ep]LB[dq:A]C[Degan:  Bold response by Black.  I would have played at A.]
;W[gp];B[fq];W[iq];B[jq];W[fn];B[en];W[em]SQ[dn]C[maybe D6 is better?

Degan: For white?  I think Black is trying to pick a fight, and white is trying to avoid one.  White is gaining more influence toward the center, and black has gained a corner. I think D6 (square) now settles large corner for black.]
;B[fo];W[rp];B[rq]LB[qq:A]C[Degan: A is more common. What is white playes there now?]

(;W[pi];B[oi];W[pj];B[oh];W[ln];B[lo];W[nq];B[mq];W[om];B[no]
;W[ng]C[Degan:  While this hurts black's eye shape, it feels too close to black's stones.]

;W[mf];B[of];W[mg];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[mc];W[ld];B[pc]
C[Degan: Good idea to cut by black.  However this is playing into a ladder.  See variation.]

(;W[qc]LB[pb:A]C[Degan:  This is a bad response by white.  A is correct.  See variation.]
;B[pb];W[mb];B[qe];W[rd];B[qb];W[ob];B[rb]C[Degan:  Large move by balck, takes corner.  Saves large weak group.  Great job!]
