AB[dd][pd][dp][jj][pp]C[Black:  Practice your tactics! There is the classic Tesuji book and Life & Death book in the Elementary Go series and the Go Problems series by Yashonori.  Plus many problem books in foriegn languages. Fortunately, problem and answer diagrams are one's main concerns in such books.

Your at the fun stage where moderate efforts in this area will increase your strength a lot.  ;-)

Also, learn to not follow your opponent around and look at the whole board. This often involves handling the double approach. Focus on the concepts behind some of those joseki.
I've included two in this review.];W[cn];B[fp];W[fc]C[I noticed in the game that you've responded with one space jumps in response to the knight's approach move many times in this game.   In H3 + handicap games learning to allow double approach moves can be very liberating as it may allow you to focus on other parts of the board.   Look at variations which are some other possibilities. One way is to try to make some assessments without going deeply into variations.]

(;B[df];W[np];B[pn];W[nc];B[pf]C[Four one-space jumps to four small knight approaches. Black is not bad off per se but it the as suggested by following moves show it seems to stem from following the other player around.]
;W[jq]C[Why follow white around. What about k17?  or d5 followed by c10? These are positive moves which attack white and gives the initiative to black.]
;B[lq]C[As a general principal when in the beginning of a game try to attack the whole group. This usually means moves on the outside of a group.   However, right now the two white stones are not really attackable. It probably would've been better to play elsewhere.  (like the moves suggested before)]
;W[nn]C[This is not such a great answer by white when black already has the q6 point.   m4 or r3 are some moves I would look at.

Black:
This is the time for a move such as p2 or p3 because you won't lose much if you end up giving up m3.

However the best move is o3. You can make your base while taking away whites.]

(;B[lo];W[nl];B[ql]C[Seems a little timid.   How about q9?]
;W[jo];B[or];W[oq];B[pq];W[nr]C[You see now giving up the two black stones would be too much?]

;B[nm];W[ko]C[Unnecessary move by white

And so is the answer by Black.

k11 for black and L11 for white is a big move.];B[ln];W[ki]
C[How about attack the three white stones in the LL?   Try disconnecting them from the j7 group. They may live but will probably endup consolidating territory in the LL corner and L side for Black.

Also, h11 is a forcing move you might not have later.];B[ni]

In k16 would have been good for white or black for that matter.]

Force white to live or connect and give yourself the chance to kill and keep your stones connected.]
