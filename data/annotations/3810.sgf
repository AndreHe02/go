C[Game review by Jonathan Cano, AKA "jonathan" and "drunkard" on KGS, 2004 Nov.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dd];W[pq];B[qp]C[black R4 is an unusual move.  It probably is suboptimal (if it wasn't it would crop up in professional play).]

;B[pr]
(;W[nq]C[after white Q4, black R3 we have transposed into a well known 3-3 invasion of the 4-4 point joseki.  White O3 is a mistake.  White P2 and S4 are possible.]
;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn]
(;W[or]C[white P2 is a mistake  White should play at R7 instead.]
;B[qm]C[Black takes advantage of white's mistake to escape.  Good move!]

(;W[jp]C[question: 16 better at q7?

jfc: no, what white needs is to beat black to R7 by playing R7 instead of P2.  Once black gets R7 there isn't much point to white Q7.]
;B[pm];W[on]
(;B[pi]C[jfc: black is strong in the lower right so Q11 is a bit slow.  Because the top side is more open and white has not sente against the black lower right, the top side is bigger. (see O17 variation)]
;W[fc]C[white beats black to the big top side.];B[df];W[jd]

(;B[qf]C[the left side is bigger than R14.];W[qe];B[pf];W[nc]

(;W[if]C[white should protect the corner instead with O16.]
;B[ne]C[black O15 is big.  now the M17 stones are connected to Q14 and have no worries.  meanwhile the white Q16 stones are studdenly cut off from the center and must take care that they can make eyes.]
;W[nd];B[mf]C[black is thrilled with the ponnuki made by N14.

This is a good point to stop and assess the board position.

black has about 30 points on the right and 5 on the top.

white has 20 points in the top right, 7 points in upper left, 10 points on the bottom, the komi of 6.5 and sente.  White has a small lead.]
;W[he]
(;B[ge];W[hd]C[this gives white too much.  now there is no aji black can use against the white stones at K16 AND white gets sente when black connectst at G17.]
;B[gc];W[cn];B[fq];W[om]C[P7 is a very big point because who ever expands along this boarder first increases their own moyo and at the same time reduces their opponents moyo.]

In any event, black should chose an attack against white here that preserves sente (variation)]

;B[pl];W[kj];B[oi]C[growing black territory with P11 is small compared to reducing white's center territory with a move like J6.]

(;W[ol]C[white P8 is too slow. White should grow the center territory with J7]
;B[jr];W[kq]
(;B[kr]C[black J6 is bigger than crawling at L2];W[im]C[white beating black to this area is the difference between winning and losing.]

(;B[qr];W[sf]C[T14/T15 is double sente.  playing here first is worth about 4 points.  Black could play T15 first, then come back to R2 and have 4 more points than he got in the game. (variation)]
;B[sg];W[se];B[rg];W[mr];B[lr];W[nh];B[mg];W[of]C[Excellent endgame tesuji by white!]

(;B[oe]C[black has blundered.  black Q12 is the best move for black that I see (variation)]
;W[qi];B[qk];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[ri]C[losing the black stones at O11 seals blacks fate.

This was a good close game with lots of opportunities for both sides.  If black avoids a few mistakes then he comes out on top.
