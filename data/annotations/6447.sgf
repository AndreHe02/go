;B[pd]C[Dear Reviewer,

Thanks for reviewing this game.

Please comment on my comments, and also feel free to criticize as much as you want!

In general, I felt that I had power early and through the middle game, but that my technique failed to use it properly.  Please comment on this as well.

Thanks!];W[qp];B[dd];W[cp];B[op];W[lp]C[Playing this pincer/extension combo is why I like to play the opposing 3-4 stones.

Why do you think its so good?
When playing this kinf of pincer you can expect, as the most simple outcome, to have black build some wall from the pincered stone and pincer your pincer. And then the important question is, how he can settle it. And with your komoku, instead og hoshi, that would be normal here, its easy for black.]

(;B[qo]C[difficult joseki...];W[pp];B[po];W[oo];B[on]C[Mistake, this can't end well for black]
;W[no];B[oq]

(;B[mq];W[kr]
(;B[rq]C[wrong];W[rp];B[ro];W[rr];B[sp]
(;W[qq];B[sr]C[You lost your advantage with this ko.];W[sq]
;B[mp];W[so];B[mo];W[nn]
(;B[sn]C[Almost pass];W[om]C[Also correct. Sthrengthens your weakest stones while black is hopeless.]
;B[sp];W[ss];B[pn]
(;W[mn]C[so you play this first, ok.];B[lo]
(;W[ln];B[ko];W[pm];B[qm];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm]
(;B[qn]C[Its easy this way :)]
(;W[so];B[jq];W[rn];B[hq]
(;W[qf]C[Ok, so I ended up with a nice gain in the lower right, and since my strength is facing the upper right, I should move in that direction like this, no?

Now your lead is so large, that the game should be easy anyway.

Yes, the direction is right, but..]
(;B[pi]C[This has to be crazy of black!

Black is loosing, so this kind of move is a good try.]
(;W[of]C[Hmm, looking at this now, perhaps I should've leaned on the top as in the variation?

This is correct, its strong.]
(;B[nd]
(;W[mf];B[pg];W[pf];B[nh]C[Now I feel like I'm under attack!

Haha, not at all :) Both black sides are weak, so you are alright.]
;W[lh];B[mj];W[kj]C[Driving Black toward my thickness, right?

Yup, perfect];B[li];W[ki];B[mh];W[lg];B[ll];W[lk];B[mk];W[ml]
;B[lj];W[kk];B[ok]C[This seems alive. So now you can either let it be as it is to preserve ko threats, or try to gain something more in sente.]

(;W[qg];B[nl];W[mm]LB[kl:A]C[Hmm, I probably didn't need to respond here since I could always follow up with A

Right];B[ol];W[oj]C[Now you give him extra points];B[pj];W[oi]
;B[oh];W[nj];B[qk]
(;W[ld]C[Ok, he lived, but small.  And I've gained great thickness, right?!  Why am I not using it correctly????

Giving him extra six points is not small, this is about 15 point worse than my variation.

And to the influence - this is fine, we will see what comes next.
Now black has to make two eyes in the corner and you should then have sente to make a moyo.]
;B[qd];W[mc];B[nc]LB[kc:A]C[Also not but, but it also has a weakness, at A]
;W[fc]C[Same comment from before.  Isn't this the right direction from my thickness?

Again the high approach is better.];B[cf];W[fe];B[if]C[Again he goes too deep!!]

(;W[gh]C[And again I attack directly when perhaps I should do a leaning attack as in the variation?

Attack like this is absolutely correct. Black should die.

But keima would be a lot better. Ogeima is a strong move, if used in a right place, because its faster and can kill where keima could't. But with your wall stretching far towards the bottom, you don't need to hurry and you should prefere the more safe move.]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[gf];W[ff];B[hh];W[gi];B[hd]
(;W[he];B[ge];W[gd];B[gc];W[fd];B[ic]C[Now black can hardly die...]

;W[kc];B[md];W[lc];B[kb];W[hc]
(;B[mb]C[Unnecesary.

I just close CGoban and the unsaved game closed with it :( So the comments might be a bit briefer than before :)]
;W[ch]C[For the third time, I have great thickess and I'm on the attack, why isn't it working?]
;B[dc];W[jg]C[Because you play gote :)];B[jf]C[Ok, now it was a good move :))]

(;W[eq];B[dl]C[Black should die here...];W[df]C[Well, I would be afraid of B tenuki, the risk is too high.]

(;B[de];W[cg]
(;B[ce]
(;W[em]C[This move is too close to black. While defending, you want to make some mess and to have some stones to attack. You give him one.
Important proverb - attack from distance.

Although a good move is hard to find here...];B[cn];W[ck]C[Again to close.

The fight is complicated and already deformed by unnatural moves, so commenting on it would be pointless.]

(;W[bg]LB[bf:A]C[I didn't see the variation.

You only want to play this endgame instead of A, when the fist line bend then would be sente for you. This is not the case.

Now the game is lost, so the comment ends here. But see the later variations and the end.]

Thanks!

This was a fast game, wasn't it? Almost no reading in it.
You should submit deeper games for a review...

I hope It was helpful.
The two main things - build moyo by high moves and attack from distance.]
