C[Hi,

I'm black in this game, where I didn't spot any big mistakes, but quite a few slow or unnecessary moves. I would like to know if my self review is ok, what I missed, and of course any additionnal advice is welcomed!]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[cd];W[qq];B[oc];W[qi]C[[Daniel\]Because 2 white stone are both in lower postion, maybe Q4 is a choice for black.]
(;B[pn]C[White 6 seemed too close to my shimari, and too far away from his corner, so I tried something here, but it was probably too slack ?]
;W[op];B[qk];W[qf]
(;B[qo]C[now I wonder if Q6 is misplaced];W[ed];B[gc]C[I think this is correct direction.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc]C[I wonder black do K16 at this point.]
(;B[ce]C[I think the joseki is at B15 instead, but I wanted to gain some time to extend from G17]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[eg];B[jd];W[mc];B[kc]C[I was wondering from which side to attack, this one helps me to settle, but maybe was the other side better ?
[Daniel\] I think it is better to try to get a seki from attacking two white stones on right, and then come to the top one. But I am not sure which way is the best.]
;W[me];B[oe];W[mg];B[og]
(;W[oh];B[pg];W[ph];B[qg];W[ri];B[ng];W[kf];B[nh]C[Black gained a lot from this corner and white still have 2 groups not settled. So P12 is wrong for white. White should settle two stones on right first.]
;W[ni];B[mh]C[Here I'm quite happy with the result, white is cut with two unsettled groups]
;W[lg]
(;B[dh]C[Why black do this suddenly? should continue attack. May be J14.]
;W[he];B[hd]C[too slow ? I felt i needed to defend here];W[ie]
;B[fe]C[trying to keep H15 cut];W[ee];B[ge];W[hg]C[Top white group is safer now. Top black group will not die but white can do j17,or something like that.]
;B[cn]C[Here white is connected, trying to develop the left side. I think it was an error, the bottom is more open. Maybe a wedge at K3 or a move around N4 ?

I was afraid of the pinced if I played F3.

[Daniel\] I am not too sure about your question. But remember white right group still weak. maybe black can compress white's bottom space by attacking it.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[en];W[jp]C[I would do H3 to break white space because black is not enough at the moment.]
;B[mi]C[There's only one unsettled group on the board, so I tried to gain by attacking]

;W[qh];B[rf];W[sh];B[re];W[rk];B[rl];W[sk];B[sl];W[qj];B[pk]
C[now everything is alive. Are we in yose yet ?
[Daniel\] I do not think black is successfull because white a live so easy from a weak group and also get chance to protect bottom.]
;W[mp];B[eh];W[gf];B[nk];W[mj];B[je];W[jf];B[id]C[probably useless, one of the losing moves ?]
;W[bb];B[bq];W[mb];B[kb];W[fh]C[[Daniel\]maybe white can do something like F9 to compress black's space. White won't scare of the attack.]
;B[fi];W[gi];B[gh];W[fg];B[gj];W[hi]

[Daniel\]It was close. I think black can win if black did better in ending. but I am not sure which way is the best.

Sorry for so many mistakes in the comments. Good luck in future games.

Thanks.])
