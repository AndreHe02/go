C[Hi.

I've been playing for about 1 year against various softwares since there are literally no people interested in go around me and I can't find the time to play online.  So I'm a beginner level casual player.

Under these conditions it's probably not that important to know what kyu I am. But I would really love to...

And I'm not sure but I "feel" that I began to catch bad habits during my vs-ai plays.

So, very much appreciated if you can evaluate my rank and warn about mistakes. I really love that game and improve it in the future.

Thanks in advance...];B[pp]C[Hello I'm Nyuubi and I'll do my best to review your game well. You said that you can't find time to play online but I really recommend you try regardless. On Kiseido go server you can play blitz and games won't last that long at all. You can also play on DGS or OGS which are turn based servers where you just play a move whenever you have time ;D


You will find tips and resume'ish thingy at the end of the game.]

-It leaves too make weaknesses in shape for white to exploit.

I don't want to guess too high or too low but on KGS server I would think you're between 15-20kyu. It's been awhile since I've been up there so I can't say precisely:)

If you play online a bit you can quickly make 10kyu KGS I think.

-Watch out for Empty triangle ( http://senseis.xmp.net/?EmptyTriangle )
-Importance in opening is CORNER, SIDE then CENTER. It is easiest to make territory in corner, then side, then center.
