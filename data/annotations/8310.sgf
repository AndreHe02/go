terraform [13k\]: =================================================
terraform [13k\]: Hello, and thank you for reviewing my game.
terraform [13k\]: Comments above the "====" line are from the game. so 
ignore those.
terraform [13k\]: I've been stuck at the 13k level for a long time now,
 so I thought I'd send in a review! I'll comment what mistakes I see in
 my own game. Thank you again for the review.


Hi. You are welcome - I am a 6k and no pro - I will write "imho" when 
you have to taste my comments with this undertone.];B[pp];W[qe]
C[soutemi [14k\]: hi gg
terraform [13k\]: I haven't played 5-3 in a while, so I thought I'd try
 it.

Good way of learning go!

terraform [13k\]: I've always thought 5-3 was for influence. Is it 
going for the side or the outside more?

imho^^
I think more to the side, 5-4 is for influence - and much more less 
common. I think the features of this move come particularly into play, 
when you try to aproach it - try a few things and see how well you get 
out of it.
Eidogo and senseis library are a nice place for a deeper investigation 
here.];B[dq];W[dd];B[pc];W[nd]C[I like this move.];B[rc]LB[nc:A]
[pd:B]C[terraform [13k\]: 
This threw me for a loop. I thought he'd try 1st or 2nd attachment 
taisha. I decided to block off the center.

If you are confident enough to play out the taisha, please give me some
 lessons - I think this joseki is for people like us just a test who of
 the players can read better - and the other one will screw up. Most 
likely we would not play joseki anymore after 4 moves ^^ But that 
doesn't mean we shouldn't try :)

I would play smth like A or B. My idea would be to shut him in 
completely - Which you also liked to do - good :)];W[oe];B[nc]

 earlier? (I _really_ have no answer here myself - but it might be an 
intereseting question to ask yourself).

I am not completely confident with this, but: Is it so bad to keep on 
stretching an the d-line? I think black can not soecure his mojo with 
just one move - and if he does, you can also play a securing move 
somewhere in your LARGE mojo.];B[ip];W[iq]LB[np:B][nq:A]C[I think something like A or B might have been possible.

so it might be a good move... I am somehow unsure. I would fear a later  invasion as white - but white is thick on the other side too, so it  should be ok... still it looks a little far from q14 and very near to  blacks thick corner.]
;B[cl]
(;W[cm]C[terraform [13k\]: This didn't end well. In hindsight maybe I 
should've attached on top.

"Top" is certainly better than this move - i agree - i think black did a good move here as its not easy for me too, to decide. I would have played in the elefants eye.]

 here...

Yeah right - happens to mee all the time. My advice: Don't let this happen. Try to play serious games - not just "spend some time on the server - get rid of some hours" (don't know if you do - just saying). Try to play at max 1 game per day - and try to take this one game very serious - make it a long game - take you time to think about the value of your moves - and if your attacks and defending moves are really efficient - if not - think of smth more severe.]
;B[ga];W[nm]C[Just to underline my last question - are you sure black can't be killed on the left side?


I don't think so - but the question is, if you really spend some time figuring this out. You should :) Its a 30 min game :)]
;B[oo];W[fn];B[fo]C[terraform [13k\]: Could I have killed 
this if I had played better? E2 was a pretty bad move, but I didn't 
read deep enough to see that.

I think the problem is, that black can play g2 in sente - when sente means you want to avoid him making eyes. So I think you can not kill.

You ask yourself this question far too late - meaning: If you were not sure about L&D here - your strategy was not sound.


I pointed out, that you have a nice understanding of the game, in terms of strategy. I think if you start to be more serious about your games, playing less lazy, maybe do some more tsumego - you will 100% let the 13k behind you. Especially L&D, when to hunt and when to defend will help you - also you know that its profitable to hunt, you sometimes misjudge the situation (I believe because of lazyness - but of course I don't know you - this is just an impression).

I think you will improve!

:)
