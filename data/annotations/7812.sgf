;B[dc]C[Hello, I'm David your reviewer. I hope you find my comments helpful.]
;W[pp];B[cp];W[pd];B[df];W[kc];B[fp];W[ck];B[qn];W[qo]C[I would prefer either O3 or some kind of pincer instead of the contact play.]
;B[qk];W[qh]C[R12 isn't necessarily bad at all, but keep in mind that it makes the invasion at R17 tempting (its a big point for white to consider at some point as well). I also like O3 and Q6.]
;B[on];W[pn]C[O3 looks a bit more reasonable in this situation. The contact play at Q6 doesn't do much for white.]
;B[pm];W[oo];B[po];W[no];B[ro];W[pn];B[rm];W[qp]C[Locally, I'd say S4 maybe. R4 doesn't really do much and its gote.]
;B[nn];W[kp]C[This isn't necessarily a bad extension but white's position is a bit high in the lower right. Also, R17 is still big for both sides.]
;B[nc];W[hc];B[ne]
(;W[of]MA[pe][pf]C[I don't like this move at P14 because white doesn't have the corner yet. Q14 or 15 would keep up the pressure on black's group.]
;B[nf];W[md]C[The peep at N16 ends up just putting pressure on white's stones in the upper right corner. I think at this point it's better to make a move from the side of the corner to prevent an invasion. If you do want to make a move from the two stones in the center I think L15 is more appropriate.]
;B[nd];W[me]C[This move at N15 doesn't really put any more pressure on black's four stones. Protecting the corner is preferable.]

(;W[oe]C[Connecting at P17 keeps black from linking up his stones to the corner and white still has the option of connecting to his stones in the upper center with N18. (see alternate)]
;B[ci];W[cn];B[iq];W[jq];B[qq];W[rp]C[I think S4 gives black too much breathing room in the corner. Probably S3 instead, though I'm not sure you can unconditionally stop black's invasion.]
;B[rq];W[sp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[sq];W[mo]
;B[gc];W[hd];B[oc];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj];B[ol];W[nj];B[lg];W[kf]
;B[bo];W[do]C[This move just encourages black to consolidate his position in the corner. Maybe move out into the center at E9 or E6 instead.]
;B[dp];W[eo];B[gp];W[bj];B[bi];W[ej]C[I like E9 or F9 better in this case.]

;B[aj];W[eh]C[This flattens black a bit on the left but locally G6 makes more sense to me.]
;B[io];W[km];B[jp];W[ko];B[jr];W[mm];B[nl];W[ml];B[gm];W[gn]
C[Is there a better response to G7?



I don't think G6 is necessarily bad but I don't see a way to cut black's move at G7 (with G6 or any other move).]
;B[hm];W[hn];B[in];W[fm];B[il];W[jm]C[The peep here doesn't really help white.]
;B[im];W[gk]C[Locally, F8 looks better. G9 invites the move at F8.]
;B[fn];W[en]C[Locally, F5 is better.];B[fl];W[fo];B[gl];W[el]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[ek]C[This seems to be a critical move as it cuts the lower left hand group off from the centre. Is that correct?


I don't think it cuts off white entirely. (see next)]
(;W[dl]MA[dj]C[I think D10 is better because the cut at D8 doesn't appear to be an issue and it looks like white can still connect up.
(see alternates)];B[dj];W[ei]C[Should this move have been at C7?


C7 would settle the group but it's not a killing move for black either. E11 is fine.]
;B[cm]
(;W[bm]C[Should this move been at D7?

Yes, I think you're right. With a move at D7 white's group is alive. (see alternate)]
