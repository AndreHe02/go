C[Thank you for asking me to do the  review.
My comments will be restricted to  some basic mistakes that both players  must overcome in order to improve.]
;B[pd]C[I say: hello];W[dp]C[*shuzo*(05:59:52): Hello.];B[de]
C[This kind of move is very popular  among some kyu players on Internet  servers.
I have to admit that I always invade the  corner at 'A' or even 'B'. The key is to  live in sente and switch to the other  part of the board or live in gote while  leaving some weaknesses in Black's  position there.
But Black is calling White to invade so  he can build a wall which can be used  in future fighting in lower-left corner  and lower side.]
;W[pp]LB[ec:A][dc:B];B[dc]LB[ce:A]TR[de]C[Now the position looks like normal  fuseki, except the marked stone is  usually at 'A'.]
;W[jd]C[Invading here can be troublesome,  especially if Black plays around M17 (I  can't be sure what's the best, but too  agressive attack wouldn't be good  because it would just stregthen White).]
;B[ic]C[This is what I meant. This move helps  White to settle and if he playes  properly he can use this group to  attack Black's right corner later.]
;W[jc];B[id];W[nc];B[pc]LB[pb:A][ne:C][lc:B][ob:D]C[This is too conservative. If white likes  to fight he can play R14 now and then  fight to settle both groups.
Here, Black's ide ais probably to  prevent White's 'A' and prepare for  invading at 'B', but White can simply  play 'C' now.
If Black really wanted to play here, 'D'  would be better, but simple extending  at R14 is usual.]
;W[ie]LB[ne:A][je:B][ie:12][qf:C]C[Professionals refer to this as the wrong  direction of play, which is very usual  for non-oriental players. Simply  jumping to 'A' makes White group safe  for now. Or, if in a mood for fighting, 'C'  is just fine.
Black can tenuki now, or even cut at  'B'.];B[he]LB[gd:A][je:B]
C['A' makes Black very strong there and  leaves White to think about his cutting  point at 'B'.
Also, Black could ignore this White's  move and play on the right side  (around R14 or so) since White  has weakness at 'B'.]
;W[hf];B[ge]LB[hd:B][gf:A]C[To me, 'B' is much safer while White  has to protect his cutting points after  what Black gets sente. This move  makes White 'A' good move.
But anyway, White is making a big  mistake here since he is attacking B's  strong group, instead of attacking the  weak one, the right corner.]
;W[ib]C[This can be left for later, there are  much bigger moves now.]
;B[hb];W[gf];B[fe];W[jb]C[This is yose move played in the early  stage of fuseki. I's value is the same  as if White played PASS.
If White rally wants to spend a move  here, protecting the cutting points is  much more useful.]
;B[hc]LB[gb:A]C[The same as White previous move.  Yes, White can play at 'A', but it can't  be compared with Black's move played  on any big point on the board.
Black could secure upper-right corner,  play in the lower-left corner... There are  so many much bigger moves that this  move is almost like PASS too.]
;W[qf]LB[md:A][pf:B]C[This may seem obvious as mentioned  before. It is not bad move, but White  has some weaknesses in his upper  group, and Black has 'A' for later.
White is provoking Black to play 'B'  which can lead to very complicated  fighting in this area, and bearing in  mind that this is the game between  11k* and 14k*, it is just a question who  will make more mistakes and who will  see how to use an opponent's mistake  after seeing it.
But in all this there is something very  nice, situations like this are very  useful for kyu player since they can  learn a lot, especially if their  opponents play without slack moves.]
;B[qe]C[Seems very obvious, but if White  plays properly, the result will be terible  for Black.]
;W[pf];B[re]LB[nd:A][pi:B][qi:C][pj:D]C[This move is very small, maybe  getting out with 'A' even at the price of  White invading the corner is better.  Now White doesn't have to think much,  'B' or 'C' are moves to think about,  each having its strong and weak  points.
'C' is good for territory, and 'B' is  excellent for building a moyo in the  center. 'D' probably would be  recommended by high dan players as  it cooperates with W's Q4 stone.
The only shortcoming of 'B' and 'D' is  that Black can jump in along the  second line if White doesn't spend  one more move in the middlegame, but  comparing to the centre that is too  small.]
;W[pj]TR[pp][hb][hc][ic][id][he][ge][fe]C[This move nicely cooperates with W's  marked stone, but White has to be  prepared for B's invasions and will  have to decide what to give.
It is easy to see how over-concentrated  B's marked stones are. The same  number of points could be obtained by  playin just 2 or 3 moves, or even better  playing elsewhere.]
;B[rf]LB[dj:A][cj:B][if:C]TR[hf][gf]C[This is so small that it almost equals  PASS. White can respond around here,  or play elsewhere.
The best move would be around A-B (I  don't mean 'A' or 'B', but around there)  since it helps a lot to the marked  stones if Black plays 'C'.]
;W[dj]C[Good.];B[nq];W[np]C[The problem here is what White wants  to keep and how much he will have to  give. Keeping both the corner and the  center is to ambitious.]
;B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[qq]C[Now Black is helping to the White to  build a wall and get enormous territory  in the center.]
;W[qp];B[mr];W[mq];B[nr];W[lq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sq];W[qn];B[qg]
;W[cq];B[eh];W[fj];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[hq]LB[jq:A]TR[lq][mq]
C['A' would help the marked stones,  while thise move leaves a lots of  possibilities to the Black.]
;B[jp];W[gp];B[go];W[fp];B[hl];W[hm]C[This helps Black to make a good  shape. If White rally wants to play  here, one point to the right would be  safer.]
;B[im];W[hn]LB[gm:A]TR[hm]C['A' strengthens the marked stone and  enables White more severe attack.  After this move Black can strengthen  himself by attacking the White two  stones.]
;B[in]C[Now White has to save the two stones  while Black has a promising shape.]
;W[fm];B[lo];W[il];B[ho];W[gl];B[jl];W[ik];B[kp];W[jk];B[kl]
;W[kk];B[ll];W[lk];B[lr];W[kq];B[jq];W[mo];B[kr];W[mp];B[ir]
;W[hr]C[This is not very good, later we'll se  why.];B[fo];W[eo]
LB[gq:A][ne:B]C[White can't play here because of Black  'A'. Since all Black groups are secured,  it would be time to do some damage to  White's potential territories. It may be  the right time to play 'B' or somewhere  around as it threatens to destroy most  of teh White center if not answer  imediately. Also Black at C11 is fine  since White C12 would be quite big.]
;B[hs]LB[gq:A][ne:B][ci:C]C[If Black really wants to play here, 'A' is  the only move, but Black could leave  this as a dessert for later and play 'B'  or 'C' or some other big move that has  to be answered.]
;W[fr];B[fs]C[This is too small for now];W[es]LB[ch:A][nf:B]
[nd:C][ne:D][pg:E]TR[pf][qf]C[White should ignore this and play 'A'  or somewhere on the right side to  strengthen the marked stones and seal  the center. The only problem is how to  do it with one move. It surely must be  around 'B', since Black threatens to  play 'C' or 'D'. White 'D' is strong, but  it makes Black 'E' hard to handle, so  White 'B' would help to stop Black 'C'  or 'D' and also help the marked stones  to counter Black's 'E' if played.

Also, there is one tesuji for Black here   (around 'B') I saw a few moves later,  but here it may be time to be played by  Black. Also White had to paly around  'B' much earlier to defend against  it.
Try to SEE that move, I'll tell it later.];B[gs]C[This is also too small. This is still a  middle game and both players play  yose moves.]
;W[gr];B[is];W[eq];B[gm];W[hk];B[fn];W[em]C[White could block immediately.]
;B[en];W[dn];B[ch]LB[bj:A][ck:B]TR[pf][qf]C[This is OK, but one point lower would  be better since White can ignore this  move because Black 'A' could be  handled by White 'B', which can't be  compared with White's play to  strengthen the two marked stones.

Try again to SEE Black's tesuji which  enables him to enter the center very  easily by attacking the two marked  stones.]
;W[ml]TR[pf][qf]C[White MUST defend the marked stones  or...]
;B[lm]LB[of:A][pe:B][pg:C][og:D][oe:E][ph:F][ne:G]C[If missed before, Black could definitely  decide the game now. Imagine Black  playing at 'A'. White would be  helpless.
Try some variations. If White 'C', than  Black 'E' is fine while 'D' leads to very  complicated variations which are out of  teh scope of this review.
Any other move would be worse for  White after Black 'A'. If White 'E', Black  'C' and Black gets into the center.  White 'B' is also naswered with Black  'C'.
So, White 'C' is the best, but if Black  continues with 'D', White 'E', Black 'F',  White 'B', Black 'G', what would  happen???
See variation.];W[mm]C[Small, much smaller than around O14.]
;B[pg]C[it was time, but I am not sure if this is  the strongest move here.]
;W[nf];B[of]LB[og:A]C[Isn't 'A' more simple and effective?  White will sacrafice the two stones, but  also he will enclose the center.]
;W[ng];B[ne];W[og];B[oe];W[me];B[nb];W[mb];B[ob];W[mc]C[Small]
;B[rj]LB[bj:A][bi:B]C[Big, but could play 'A' first, since now  White can play for sente here to get to  play 'B'.]
;W[ri]LB[qk:A][qj:B]C[Useless, just sumple 'A' or much better  'B'. See variation for White 'B'.]
;B[qi]LB[qj:A]C[Maybe Black 'A' works? see var.];W[qj];B[rh]
;W[rk];B[si]LB[bj:A]C[Could play at 'A' first, which is much  bigger.]

(;W[pi]LB[rl:B]C[Also small, could play 'A' first.
If Black plays 'B', see Var.];B[ph];W[oh];B[sk]LB[bi:A]C[Small, White can go to 'A' now, which  would win the game.]
;W[rl]LB[bi:A]C[Also much smaller than 'A'.];B[bj]C[White had many chances to defend  against this. Now his win is  questioned.]
;W[dg]LB[ck:A][if:B]C[This doesn't help because of 'B', see  later comments. Simple 'A' is a must.]
;B[dh];W[ff];B[ef]C[This is small for now, jumping deeper  into White's left side is much bigger.]
;W[eg];B[fg];W[fh];B[gg]LB[dg:A]C[Now it is clear why White 'A' was bad.]
;W[hg];B[gh];W[hh];B[fi];W[gi];B[fh];W[hi]LB[if:A]TR[jb]C[Cutting point at 'A' costed White a  game, and that wouldn't happen if he  played around there instead of the  marked stone.]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[cl]LB[cm:A][ck:B][bn:C][cl:14]C[Better at 'A'. If White answers with a  move here, Black first plays 'B' and  then 'C'.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[dm];B[ln];W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[gb];W[sl];B[sj]
;W[bi]LB[cj:A][gn:B]C[Usless, better 'A' and then 'B'.];B[cj]
