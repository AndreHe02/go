C[Tuomas: I started to play after a long break. My previous games very big disappointment but before that I had been doing very well. This game was playing in Dragon Go Server and it was my first real comeback game, even game against more or less even opponent.

I won this game, and I know that that kind of games are usually hard to review. I still hope you can get something out from this.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj]C[Tuomas: I usually don't play san-ren-sei because I don't like losing initiative this early. I also don't like the idea of focusing this much on one side. For the same reason I avoid playing the chinese fuseki. Instead kobayashi fuseki is one of my favourites. But now I decided to give san-ren-sei a try.]
;W[nq]
(;B[lp]LB[qn:1]C[Tuomas: Playing around 1 just doesn't feel right. Four stones on one side is too much to bear. But the pincer doesn't feel right either. Help me, senpai.

R: i think pincer you played is fine. playing 1 would also be fine. Go is such a flexible game that in the beginning, basically anything reasonable is often ok, especially at our level. See variant.]

;W[oq];B[no];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn]C[Tuomas: This canot be a joseki. White got too much and black wall is far from perfect. What went wrong

R: Actually, i think black is fine so far.];W[nc]
(;B[do]C[Tuomas: My thinking here is that hoshi is able to take some beating while 4-3 is vulnerable. Even more so now that black has some influence. If white plays double approach I will fight with my wall.

R: How about a pincer? See continuation.];W[pf];B[nd];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[mb]
(;B[og]LB[ne:1]C[Tuomas: I wanted to take steam out from this white stone. White gets a nice hane but I tried to place this so that the cut at 1 would not too dangerous.

R: It is important to N17 before p13.];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]
C[Tuomas: I felt good with this exchange as it pretty much killed the white stone.]
;W[md];B[me];W[le];B[ld]C[Tuomas: I also considered to pass this and then try to make a base on upper side after we exchange few moves in center. But then I decided to go for this plan. I like to have something to work with, so my normal opening goal is to make opponent have one running group from early of the game. And this seemed like a situation where I could make one without taking too much damage.]
;W[mc]
(;B[kd]C[R: l16 is overplay. See var.];W[mf];B[ne];W[ke];B[jd]
;W[je];B[ie]C[Tuomas: Black is on the limit of being able to make hane. Is this reasonable? If not then my plan was not good one, white gets too much influence.

R: j15 unreasonable, w should cut, b would collapse.]
(;W[kg];B[hd];W[fc]C[Tuomas: Getting that would have been sweet for black, but running into center fits into my plans very well.]
;B[ig];W[ki];B[fp]C[Tuomas: Now I have the running white group so it is time to give white little headache. Bad side of this plan is that now I will live and die with my center. Also note how white has all corners. That can't be good thing, right?

R: actually it's hard to assess... even if l11 lives (as it should), black aught to get a big right side, which aught to be enough to cophensate. Basically, i'm not sure but the game at this stage feels even...]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fr]C[Tuomas: I got nice walls in here but somehow I am not happy about this result. I had one extra move but this looks too much like normal joseki. Could this have been played better?]
(;B[dj]C[Tuomas: Very common theme in my games: make a moyo around opponen group.

R: This feels alittle loose. see var];W[dh]LB[dj:1]C[Tuomas: This move looks too good. Should black have been more aggressive with black 1?]
;B[ii];W[kk];B[df];W[cj];B[ck];W[dk];B[di];W[ci];B[ch]LB[eh:1]
C[Tuomas: The first idea was of course to play 1 and try to build center. But the only thing I like more than having one running opponen group is to have two. So I decided that this is the place where we start the fighting.]
;W[cg];B[bh];W[dg];B[bg];W[cf];B[bf];W[ce];B[fj]TR[ci][cj]C[Tuomas: Main plan was to kill marked white stones with sente so that I could play something like this. I like this result very much. 

R: right, esp. since you have c17 in reserve...];W[gj];B[jj]
;W[mk]
(;B[il]TR[gj]C[Tuomas: I felt that this was more important than reacting to white attachement.]
;W[pi]C[Tuomas: White counter attack. Taking the outside is best course for black. If white lives on the right side black will probably win the game by killing the center.

I got to say, I hate when winning the game depends on me killing something. Usually that means that I will lose the game. I like to decide games by killing something in center but it should happen so that opponent is forced to do something foolish and ends up dying. This is not quite like that.

R: Q11 looks like an overplay!];B[oi];W[oh];B[ph]C[Tuomas: Change of plans, white can have the outside if I can build my wall this high.]
;W[nh];B[qi];W[ng]C[R:]
(;B[of]C[R: p14 not needed?];W[se];B[sf];W[sd];B[rf]C[not urgent enough, you should try to kill center NOW!]
;W[ol]LB[po:1]C[Tuomas: This is too much and I will lose if I am soft. Time to fight. Unfortunatelly my "wall" breaks because of this at cut 1. This is one of my great pitfalls. I need to rely on my groups and having to fix this kind of defects really kills my strategy.

R: dont worry so much about 1, just stry to attach center. N7 is the keypoint in white's shape. TAKE IT NOW!!]
(;B[pm];W[pl];B[ql];W[ln];B[ni]C[Tuomas: This is vital to break white shape, but is it too slow?

R: yea, too late, besides you should have played n11 earlier (right after n9 before j8...)]
;W[mi]C[Tuomas: Lucky that white made passive response.

R: Actually this seems ok for white, it makes living shape...]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[ml];W[ll];B[mm];W[nn];B[mj]C[Tuomas: Must keep sente and make the fight larger.]
;W[lj];B[lk]C[Tuomas: Is this ko reasonable? Black has a lot less to lose in it, but somehow I have feeling that if black would lose it he would lose the tempo of the game. White would have no weak groups left, black is behind in territory and would have very hard time in building more. Game over?

R: This ko is infact very big...];W[ic]C[Tuomas: This is big but I could not come up with any threat that I would respond if I was white so I decided to bite it.

Somehow this is very typical for my ko-fights. I ignore threats very easily and that is probably one of my weakness.]
;B[mk];W[id];B[kj]LB[he:1]C[Tuomas: White group is more or less ok now. It was never in danger of dying but now it is still shaky and question is how much of it will survive. White will have hard time with black center, but somehow I have feeling that the game would be over if white would play at 1.

R: remember that c17 is still open, maybe w can play b15 now?]
;W[kp]
(;B[lq]C[R: In terms of fighting shape, this is not ideal. I prefer L3 or n3, looks better...]
;W[kq];B[gr]C[Tuomas: I want to seal the bottom but this move doesn't feel good. But I need sente. White corner is still weak, could I exploit it somehow?]
;W[fq];B[gq];W[gp];B[hp];W[go];B[ho]C[Tuomas: This is horrible plan and I know it, but I could not come up with any better.

R: you shoudl protect at j3 before h5, i feel. In go, you should move like a frog: one step back before jumping forward.]
;W[lr]C[Tuomas: This sequence cought me by surprice.]
(;B[lo];W[jr];B[ko]C[Tuomas: Is this too slow?];W[gn];B[iq]
TR[ck][cn][dn][do]C[Tuomas: Again I choose the fighting variation. My thinking is that even if I lose some territory I want to get captives to make it up. I somehow assumed that my marked stones can take the presure.

This is one high level question. This is the way I want to play and no amount of rational though can make me play otherway. So what I need to do is to make all my groups so strong that they can later take unseen amount of presure. Please keep this in mind when giving me advice. How should I try to improve my style? What kind of moves would you propose.

I can't change myself, I am quite sure about that.

Anyway here the group will break as we will soon see. This is where this game was lost.

R: j3 is good... surely marked stones can somehow manage.];W[ep]
;B[fo]C[f5 is questionable...];W[fk]
(;B[fi]C[Tuomas: This exchange made me happy. It makes me strong locally and removes major aji.]
;W[eo];B[fn];W[en];B[fm];W[em]TR[gj][fk]C[Tuomas: Too bad that the exchange that made me happy also set up nasty trap that I didn't see at all when I was in rush to make the strong local shape. At this point I know what is going to happen and see it as inevitable.]
;B[gm];W[cl];B[bk];W[bl];B[bj]C[Tuomas: It hurts but at least this group is now settled. Now I can use it for offense.]
;W[ek]C[Tuomas: I don't quite see the point of this one, it seems very slow to me. Anyway white has decisive lead and black has only one chance to come back.]
;B[hc]LB[he:1]C[Tuomas: Time to fix 1 and now I realize that I can do it some profit.]
;W[if];B[he];W[jb];B[ib]LB[hb:1]C[Tuomas: In some ways this feels like aji-keshi, but the aji is so small anyway that the the protection against 1 is totally worth it. It should be quite clear now what is my plan: upper left corner.]
;W[jc];B[hf]LB[gb:1][be:2]C[Tuomas: I need to make this group strong with sente. If I would be white I would play 1 and 2 and the game would be over.  Well, at least very hard for black.]
;W[gi]C[Tuomas: This seems weak move to me, it is something that double digit kuy player would play honestly expecting other to fall in it. I don't see any other meaning in it. Should I be insulted? :D]
;B[fh];W[gl]C[Tuomas: White seems to be going for end game and I can't let him get the flow.]
;B[fs]C[Tuomas:];W[es];B[gs];W[fl];B[hn]C[Tuomas: I am sick of all the trouble I have got with this group and I am happy to get it resolved for good. Somehow I feel that white did some thank you moves in here. Anyway, now I got sente and I have no problems with this part of board anymore.]
;W[er];B[al]C[Tuomas: Another sente. I also want to gain as much as possible from the fact that this group was settled in such a painfull way.]
;W[am];B[ak];W[bm];B[cc]LB[bd:1]TR[he][fh]C[Tuomas: I also considered playing at 1 but then decided that with all this aji also this must work. Now I could turn earlier white moves against him. More than anything I am happy with the marked stones. What can white do now?

R: yes w seems in trouble.];W[bd];B[eb]TR[bf]C[Tuomas: Is this good sequence? Should I try to utilize marked stone earlier?

R: b17 would also be ok, but this is fine.];W[ec]C[Tuomas: This is another move that I don't quite understand. It doesn't look like killing move to me.]
;B[fb];W[gb];B[dc];W[gc]C[Tuomas: I didn't understand what white is doing during game. He didn't seem to have any intention of really killing my invasion. After the game I started to think that white could actually be saving his own group. I didn't expect to get white killed and I was just hoping to turn his weakness into sente after I have made my group alive.

Am I lacking killers instincts here? Should I be raising my katana for final blow?]
(;B[bc]C[Tuomas: Now that I look this, this black group looks very very alive.]
;W[fa]C[Tuomas: Here I was thinking that I don't want to give these two stones so that I could get sente.]
;B[da];W[ga]
(;B[ba]LB[hb:1]C[Tuomas: Well now this group lives with or without any outside aji. The big question is, could black have taken 1? Even if white manages to live it would be huge point for end game and give nice sente move for more points.

R: g19 should be at h18, b19 should be at h1!!! see var.];W[hb]
;B[mq];W[mr]
(;B[nf]LB[pg:1]C[Tuomas: Is this reasonable? Or is it too slow. I want to shake white group a bit and also cover my own weakness at 1. This move also feels now a bit thank you move, giving white too solid group.

R: of course n12 is better];W[mg];B[cd];W[ff];B[be]LB[ff:1]
C[Tuomas: White 1 was better response than what I expected and now black loses sente. But I still consider this as quite large end game move with potential for more.]
;W[ik];B[jk];W[hl];B[hm]LB[im:1]C[Tuomas: First instinct is to play 1 but now I don't think I can afford it and I feel that I can afford this.]
;W[jl];B[im];W[ji];B[ij];W[ih];B[hh];W[gh]LB[dd:1]C[Tuomas: White got nice moves here, I guess. At least this last one seemed good because now black can't get much from the weakness at 1.]
;B[jh]LB[dd:1]C[Tuomas: I decide just to squeeze out what points I still can. This way I also reactivate the some of the weakness at 1.]
;W[fg]LB[dd:1]C[Tuomas: This again, time to get done with it. This also protects against my intention to kill the big white group. Black can get plenty of points from 1 but it seems gote to me.]
;B[bi];W[jp];B[kh]C[Tuomas: I estimate that taking few points from here is bigger than respecting white moves. This ruins white shape nicely.]
;C[Result: B+Resign

I won the game and the first question is how that could happen? I do consider this as a lost game that I brought home just with fighting skills. And that too is just so typical for me. So apart from fighting, how could I have won this game?

Then another hard question, you have now some idea of my style and capabilities. Should I prefer hoshi or 3-4 at fuseki? With hoshi stones I get the manoverability and durability that I need. But with those I always end up lacking territory and having to kill something to win. I really don't like the way my opponent had all corners in this game, which is also very typical for my games. (The one corner that I was allowed to take doesn't really count in my opinion.)

Another similar style of question is, should I try to stydy san-ren-sei more or continue spreading my stones all over the board? How should I change the way I play san-ren-sei?

R: Overall, you were winning most of the game, i think you underestimated the amount of house you could make in center... but your biggest mistake was being to lenient and too late to attack the center group. It was on the verge of death for a long time!

I suggested some variations of what you could have done better, but in any case you did well overall in this game; both players make some mistakes (well, this is true at any level!), in the end, black made less mistakes than white, so you won!]
