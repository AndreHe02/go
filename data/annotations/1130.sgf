C[NB: Hi,

I played this game as white last week on IGS. Unfortunately, I lost by time after 92.

Black managed to build a big big moyo.
I'm not sure that I handled the situation well...  So I'm particularly interested in when and where I should have invaded his construction. Or what I should have done to prevent such a situation to occur.

Of course, any comments on any other point  are welcome.

;W[ec];B[id];W[ef]C[NB: I'm not used to J16 in this situation.
So I played E14 without much conviction...
How would you react to J16 ?

NH: This move is ok for me. You could have played tobi too.]
;B[fd]LB[cg:a]C[Wrong direction for B. Should be at a (C13)]

(;W[cc]C[Here, you MUST play E16 to cut black. See var. The troubles you had come from this move.]
;B[ed]C[Good for B. W10 is damage.];W[dd];B[de];W[dc];B[bd]
C[Black should connect at C15.];W[bc];B[df]C[The "natural" move for White now is G18 to slide into Black moyo and to prevent being shut up.]
;W[ci];B[dh];W[cl]C[B can shut W up in the corner (see var)]

(;B[di]C[Maybe you can tenuki here, as B is gote if he wants W20. You can consider F8 locally or R14, O17, R3 or H3...]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[fj]
(;W[qf]C[Instead of this move, you can consider the other side (O17). See var.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]C[NB: I considerered playing Q12 instead.
But I felt R11 was more secure.
Mistake?

W32 is ok.];B[qq];W[pq];B[pp]C[You can also try something like the var.]

(;W[po];B[op];W[rq];B[qr];W[rr]C[Instead of W40, you should connect at S4. If Black wants to keep the corner he must play Q2, so you have the sente to play P14, for example.]
;B[pr];W[qn]C[Connection at R5 is better for the yose (see var)]

(;B[of]C[P12  is the limit of B and W moyos. You can play here now.]
;W[gq]C[Too little. P12 or the slide at G18 are bigger];B[fm]
;W[dn];B[oi]C[NB: Now black's strategy is becoming very clear.
And I realise in panic, that black's moyo won't be easy to reduce...

NH: I agree with you. The game in now difficult for W.
The "natural" zone of reduction is between B47 and B45. You can try as in var.]

(;W[kc]C[NB: I have no choice but to invade.  Yet there is hardly enough space, and my time is running short.
Do you think I had enough space to settle?

NH: No, I think you must be patient, play big yose move (F17 following by H18 to begin with) and then, count the score and resign or continue :)
