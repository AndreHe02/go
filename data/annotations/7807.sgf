AB[pd][dp]C[hey, i'm faza, currently 7k KGS/ 6k INA
i'll try to review your games
i'll mark my comment with fa];W[dd];B[pq]C[fa: it's better to play in same line]
(;W[po]C[C:Since i was playing against he handicap, which i am still new with, i though i would take the agressive stance. was it too much too soon?

fa: well, it alright but it think kakari in c6 or o17 is bigger]
;B[jq]C[C: this seems a little awkward of a move to me.

fa: yea, but since your opponent got a handycap he can play slowly and peacefully like this
but in the other hand, it give u time to strengthen your q5 group]
;W[no]C[C: this move was a new tactic i have never tried. normally, i would have just extended up the right side, but before i did i decided to try and intimidate him.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pl]C[C: after i saw this i decided i liked the playout of my O5 stone.]
;B[qp];W[qo];B[mp]C[C: correct me if i am wrong, but i saw no threat here. it seemed WAY to small of a play.

fa: yea, the black group is pretty much safe. u should take this as your adventage]
(;W[jd];B[lq]C[C: again...];W[qf]C[C: it was my hope that if a fight broke out over this stone that i could either play him down into my thick or at least apply some preasure in the corner.]
(;B[qh]C[C: i saw this move coming. it seems popular. what are some other moves that black could have made in response? ideas?

fa: check the variation before, either way white can get a big point on the right side so i think reverse pincher like this is the best move for this situation]
;W[qj];B[oh];W[of]
(;B[mh];W[qd]C[C: i felt prettty confident about the flow of the game, and i wanted to try and fight in the top corner. was this too soon?

fa: no, it's alright. black should secure his area 1st by playing o16 but he play n12 so is't alright to attack the right corner now]
;B[pe];W[qe];B[qc];W[rc];B[oc];W[pf];B[qb]
(;W[rb]C[C: in hind sight, i feel this was too small for me. what about a move like... say N16?

fa: well, n17 will give 6-7 points more but i think this move is not too small. it make a miai so your corner group is settled now so you can take your time playing else where]
;B[lc];W[nd];B[nc];W[od];B[md];W[me];B[le];W[kd];B[ne];W[oe]
;B[pc]
(;W[nf]C[C: i think i would have achieved more by placing at N14. but either way, probably too small. thoughts?

fa: yes, n14 better but your corner group already settled so it's better to leave it for now]
;B[mf];W[ld];B[ne];W[kc];B[me];W[lb];B[mc];W[gd]C[C: i feel like this was a solid move. i connected two groups, one of which was under fire, and i also borderline guarenteed a large area.

fa: yes, it's big];B[mb]
(;W[dj]C[C: i saw the last black stone as too small a threat and proceded into the left side.

fa: not only too small, the continuation ends in sente for you so it's a right idea to spread your area]
(;B[dg]
(;W[ef]C[C: should i have just extended downward?

fa: yah, i think it's bigger];B[cf];W[be];B[ch];W[eh];B[di]
;W[ei];B[cj]
(;W[dh]
(;B[ci];W[ck]C[C: i thought i might get something by playing a little more agressive here. any comments on this left side would help a lot.

fa: well, you have to make sure your group alright before attacking]
;B[dk];W[ej];B[cl];W[bk]
(;B[dl]C[C: i feel that if he had played B8 and kept attacking my stones i would have most likely not come out with a lot.

fa: yes, maybe B afraid of a ledder but actually B already have C8 as ladder breaker so D8 is not needed.
instead, B8 can easily kill W group];W[bj];B[bl];W[bi];B[bh]

(;B[ai];W[cg];B[ak];W[ah];B[al]C[C: at this point, i noted that i gave him a lot of presence in the bottom left corner. it worried me.]

;W[tt]C[fa: a bit advice from me
- remember to always count your group and your opponent group liberty
(ex: your group in K10, if you aware of the coming danger you can save it and win by 40 point more)
-check the board carefully
(ex: G17 is dead, you lost 4 point for not noticing it)
-always safe your group 1st before attacking
(ex: you should move to M1 instead of O2)
-be a bit more aggresive, whenever your group safe, use the opportunity to expand your moyo or reduce your opponent moyo
-work on yose and L&D problem
-play more games];B[tt]TB[am][an][bm][bn][bo][cn][do][gp][hj]
