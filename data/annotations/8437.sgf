C[Thanks upfront for reviewing this!  I would like general comments by a more experienced player.  Anything from opening to end game is appreciated.  I feel like I played fairly well this game, with 1 big blunder near the end, at which point the game was already lost.
Matt

Hon: Hi, I am Bernd from Germany, HonFu in the GTL and in other online go places.

In this game both sides missed many valuable tactical opportunities which would have totally changed the result. On the other hand there was some vulgarity in style from both sides, strengthening the opponent with no need. But we will see in game.]
;B[pd];W[qq];B[cd];W[cq]C[I have been using this opening a lot.]
;B[ic];W[qj]C[k4 bigger?

Hon: The value of a side point is defined by how dearly the corners want that point. Your 3-3-Stones hardly want anything, they are happy in the corner, so the lower side is rather unimportant. 

The hoshi stone in the upper right wants R10, so it is big to take this away from black. The left side is also big if you consider that whe whole black moyo at the top wants to develop along the sides.

The chinese formation has the meaning of building up a double wing moyo, since black gets either the left or the right side. White of course gets the other, so he could treat them as miai and play K4, but in the end black's moyo would be more valuable than white's, because 3-3-Stones are not good at supporting a moyo.]

(;W[dn]C[I'm thinking k3 is better

Hon: No, I don't think so, because it is not threatening the group so much. Cutting through here or getting out on the left side looks normal.]
;B[op]C[Hon: You should not ignore this.]
(;W[em]C[Hon: It is a yummy move to beat on this stone, but ...]
(;B[dj];W[po];B[lq]
(;W[fq]C[Not important at the moment?

Hon: Yes. You should mostly play moves that influence strength or weakness of stones. D4 and D5 are already so weak that black doesn't really care about them anymore.]

(;B[el];W[fm];B[nn]C[Hon: Black obviously missed his chance on the left.]

(;W[ch]C[Hon: This looks risky because you are not living at the top yet.]
(;B[fe]
(;W[hb];B[ib];W[ge];B[fd];W[fc];B[gd];W[de]C[Hon: Vulgar - you strengthen the shape of your opponent on the outside while taking your own liberties.]
;B[ce];W[ee]C[Hon: Same here.];B[ef];W[hd];B[ff];W[hc];B[id]
;W[he];B[if]LB[hb:1][hc:6][hd:5][de:3][ee:4][ge:2][he:7]C[Hon: This whole sequence was very bad for you. Every of your seven moves did only one thing: strengthen the opponent. You should never play moves like this or move yourself into a situation where you have to!

The main problem was not defending the top group instead of C12. After that you were forced to "live" with vulgar moves.]

(;B[cg]C[Hon: I wonder what black is afraid of.];W[bk];B[bj]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[od];B[pc];W[of]
(;B[nc]C[Hon: This is slack, taking (not even safe) points on the third line right in front of his super wall.]
;W[pg]C[Hon: It's convenient for white to get out easily like this.]
;B[qh]C[Hon: Black goes and helps white some more.];W[qg];B[rg]

;B[sf];W[qi];B[ph];W[oh];B[pi];W[oj];B[ri];W[pj];B[sh];W[oi]
C[Hon: Yes, just as you before in the top left he just helped you and made you strong.]
;B[rh];W[dk];B[ej];W[rj];B[pm]
(;W[on]C[Hon: This is bad shape, you can only play like this if you read out it works. 

It is vulgar since you are taking your own liberties while giving him more on the outside. If the cut works really well, you might play it.]
(;B[pp]
(;W[om]C[this....quite an overplay i think.  b should have just r4 i think

Hon: Correct.]
(;B[oo];W[qo];B[qp];W[rp];B[ol];W[pn];B[nm];W[rr]C[Hon: Here you see the result of your initial vulgar moves: Your five stones are surrounded and do nothing. They have only two liberties. He got strengthening moves on the outside in the meantime.]
(;B[pl];W[rm];B[ek];W[nl];B[ik]
(;W[gk]C[Hon: As an endgame this works, but you end up with a vulgar shape which rather helps him. You should find a more efficient way to reduce him.]
;B[gl];W[fl];B[fk];W[hl];B[gj];W[hk];B[hj]C[Hon: Again you end up being on the inside, having no liberties, strengthening him on the outside.]
;W[il]C[Hon: This looks really bad, you just help him developing.]
;B[jl];W[jk];B[ij];W[jm]C[Hon: Another vulgar move, giving him more liberties while getting nothing in return.]
;B[kl];W[in];B[km];W[jn]C[Hon: Since he can not answer with L6, the move is okay. Otherwise it also would be a vulgar move. 

Vulgar moves as endgame, when there is nothing better, are alright of course, but you got to watch out playing self-surrounding moves. Doing in the center from your wall would have been easier and more effective.]

Left side is double sente even if you play it conservatively, and F2 is also a big capture.]

Hon: The mistake was the move before this already.

Okay, this is the end of the review. Besides the tactical opportunities both of you missed (study tsumego to make an improvement on that), there were many vulgar moves in this game. It is a bit hard to define what exactly a vulgar move is (you can also say "bad technique" or "crude move"), but in most cases it is a move that helps the opponent more than it helps you. Most cases of vulgarity here were self-surroundings. Go is about surrounding enemy stones, so you must try to avoid playing moves that help the opponent surround your stones.

If by this review you get a feeling for only this, you will have learned something really valuable.]
