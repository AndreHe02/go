RE[B+R]

C[krv: I was playing white here. Thank you for your comments in advance.

You're welcome.

I have a few suggestions about commenting your game before submitting it for review.

Play out some variations instead of just suggesting moves. I'd like to know why you suggested move and what you thought would happen afterwards. That way, I can tell you not just whether the move would work or not, but also what was wrong with your reasoning when you decided upon the move.

At the beginning of the game (i.e. here), put a comment about how you felt you went, and where you think you went wrong. I usually find when I consider a game I have just played that at first I think: "I lost because this group died", but the I look back and re-consider: "This group dies because I ignored that move". Or if there were no great losses in the game, talk about how you felt about your moyo, or reduction - the strategic things.

Also talk about where you want me to focus my comments. Perhaps you're interested in a particular joseki, or the life or death of a particular group, or the end-game, or the opening. Some of these things don't warrant a lot of analysis unless you're particularly interested in them. I could go through a whole bunch of variations to show you how a group could have lived when even I couldn't have been expected to come up with the solution while sitting playing the game, or instead I could simply point out how you let your group get too weak earlier.

Important points in this game:
1. You failed to see an important weakness in Black's shape in the lower left that could have strengthened your stones on both sides. Always look for deep placements that threaten to connect in two directions.
2. You gave Black chances to invade, firstly at the bottom, and later on at the top. Keep an eye out for isolated stones that could easily be cut off from your stronger groups. In this game, Black failed to take full advantage of these weaknesses, but as the situation on the top showed, it's better to be safe than sorry. Make your stones strong, and you can do anyhing.
3. You let a quite solid framework get cut apart on the right side when you cut at S15. Because you had strong Black groups on both sides, you should have played a defensive move that helped connect your three stones on the third line.
4. You lost three stones on the right side where you didn't need to. This is not a big deal, but it shouldn't have happened anyway. When you have a cutting point like R10, you have to be mindful of it every time your opponent makes a move in that area.
5. You let your left side group (which started out quite strong and with a lot of potential) get boxed in so tighly that it didn't have room to live, and for very little compensation in terms of middle territory. When you and your opponent are pushing each other like you did from moves 95-107, be very aware of what your opponents new wall will be facing. The stronger you get at this game, the more important that concept will become.
6. You resigned without realising how close you were to winning the game. Sometimes big groups die and you can still win. It's just a part of the game. And if you can see it coming and go with the flow, sometimes you can extract a lot of potential out of those dead groups (although probably not in this case).

Lastly, I want to get better at reviewing games, so please *do* e-mail me with any questions about things I didn't comment on, or comments you didn't understand, or variations that you think were more realistic than the ones I included, or if you thought my variations didn't go on for long enough, or even if you don't understand my English.

I look forward to hearing from you.];B[qd];W[dq];B[pp]C[Although I don't really understand why yet, a play in the top left corner would be more normal than a play in the bottom right, because from the bottom right, the other two stones on the board appear on the third line, and are less interesting than from around D16, where they are on the fourth line, and hence more interesting.

But I *really* wouldn't worry about that until you're dan-level ;)]
;W[cd];B[cn];W[cl]C[I'd like to have had a comment here about why you chose to pincer.]
;B[bq]C[C3 would have been joseki for Black here, and with good reason, I think. B3 is low, making little territory, and it does little to put pressure on D3.]
;W[ci]C[krv: How about G3 or B4?

This move is reasonable. I wouldn't worry about it.

G3 would also be reasonable.

B4 might have stopped Black connecting, but without D3 or C8 having a base yet, she'd probably be able to put up a very effective fight, or sacrifice one of her stones in a very useful way.]
;B[cq];W[dp];B[dn]C[D6 is not a good move by Black. White can Play B5 and Black can't stop her connecting.]

(;W[hq]C[Reasonable, although later Black may aim at attacking at F3, so G3 would have been worth considering.]
;B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]C[Black play joseki this time.];W[dc];B[dd]
;W[cb]C[Are the two of you playing out of a joseki book? I don't think I'd come up with this by myself.]
;B[bc];W[ed];B[de];W[ec];B[bb];W[dg];B[cf]C[C14 is bad shape, as we'll see later. E15 or C15 would have been better.]
;W[ee];B[df]
(;W[nq]C[krv: E14?

Possibly. Black could hardly ignore E14. See variation. But I don't think E14 is urgent.]
;B[oc];W[lc]C[Nice checking extention, but not urgent.];B[qn]
;W[pr];B[qq]
(;W[ql]C[No. You're ignoring your weak stones at O3 and Q2, and attacking Black's corner is very unlikely to be successful.

L3 would be much better, giving you a lot of territory on the bottom the Black could not easily touch.]
;B[qr]C[Black strengthens her position while weakening yours...]
;W[qi]C[A move at the bottom is urgent. R8 can easily look after itself or be sacrificed.]
;B[ef]
(;W[pq]C[krv: Bad move?

No, but L3 would still be better. Q2 is not really worth saving.]
;B[op];W[qf]C[R14 is not an urgent extension, because there are strong positions on either side. Later on, it would be a good move, but it is still too early.]
;B[rf]

If you wanted to escape.];B[pd];W[ri];B[sh]C[krv: Q14?];W[sg]
;B[pi];W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[oe]C[Black should probably not worry about P14, but rather worry more about the Q17 and R12 groups.]
;W[pj];B[oi];W[si];B[ph];W[oj];B[ng]C[This is a bad move by Black, as the continuation shows. Better would be O11.]
;W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[og];W[nm]C[krv: How to play here?

This is fine, but be mindful of the two cutting points at R10 and O10. R10 is a big deal, because the S11 group is short on liberties.]
;B[rc];W[sd];B[nj];W[mj];B[nk]C[Black is now threatening to cut succesffuly at R10.]
;W[mk];B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[om];B[qj];W[pk];B[rj]C[Not such a bad trade after all.]
;W[mo]C[A nice moyo-oriented move.];B[rm]C[A wasted move by Black - it achieves little.]

;B[fn]
(;W[hl]C[No, you can't contain Black. Better just to make territory with a move like F4, or protect you left stones with a move like B13.

Or even better, to take advantage of the weakness at B5.];B[ho]
;W[hp];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W[im];B[gl];W[gk]C[This pushes Black towards your weak stones, without making much territory in the middle.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[hk];W[il];B[fj]C[You should be defending your left side group now, while it still has a chance to run away.]
;W[gi];B[fi];W[bg]C[Good. By the time you can't run away, it's definately time to defend.]

(;W[bh]C[krv: C12 is better? Where I've losed C11 group?

I don't know if there is any hope. I think B14 was okay, but after Black F9, F10, F11, living at all would be hard.]
;B[bj]C[This was a good move by Black. I think after this White was dead. That makes now a good time to look at how Black stopped you from being able to escape.]

Each marked point is a point of territory that can not be changed even with a gote play. It serves as a good approximation. It suggests that Black is winning by 12.5 points, which is not such a big lead that it can not be overturned. I think now would be a good time to consider the game to have entered the end game. Neither player really has any week groups, with the possible exception of M17. Therefore, I would suggest a play such as L15.]

K16 or N18 or F4. K13 achieves little, and the threat of losing the two stones at H13 while gaining sente is no big deal.]

;W[le];B[kd];W[mb];B[nc];W[kc];B[jd];W[jb]C[krv: I've missread here. Could I did anything

Yes. Keep playing. You weren't that far behind. I'll play one line out to the end... I just had a review done through the GTL, and my reviewer said to me: "You shouldn't think you're behind, you should know it." It's true. After your left side group died, you thought you were way behind, but you weren't. The line I just played out to the end edned with Black winning by 0.5 points, and I didn't craft it that way. All you had to see was:
1. The amount of squeezing you could do to the K16 stones.
2. The tesuji at S18 (remember that one, it's good).
3. Keep sente as long as possible in the end game, and when you have to give it up, do it with the largest gote move.]
