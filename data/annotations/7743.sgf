How could i avoid black doing this big central territory?

thanks for looking at my game



Hi,

My name is Jan and I'll be the reviewer of your game.
I play as 11kyu on IGS as "PeatMan" (and sometimes on DGS as 10 kyu)
My comments will be indicated by "J".
I hope this review helps you to improve your game.

You are not playing too low. I would rather say you are playing too high. Usually two stones on the third row (like the marked places) are seen as stable save groups that can't be killed when defended properly. (That is: in general, depending on the surroundings.) Playing at the fourth row claims more territory but makes the construction more vulnerable to attacks. You'll find an example in this game. I'd prefer the third row.

Try reading "in the beginning" by Ishigure, if you like to become stronger by reading books. "Sensei's library' is a great source for go-knowledge and I'm sure there's lots to find about the beginning. (http://senseis.xmp.net/)

You had the chance to get a central area yourself but you missed it because you were afraid for the eye space for your groups when you didn't need to be.

Ask yourself with each move what you want to accomplish with this move or if it a nescessary move. Sometimes moves are made by instinct or as a reflex when they should be given a little more thought. I also often make this mistake. We (at least we kyu-players) all do, but less as we grow stronger.]
;W[qo]MA[pp][qp][pq]N[1 (R5)]C[This is a place where one could play but it is less used than the marked places. It is not wrong, but be aware that it invites black to play Q3. Ask yourself if you want this and what your plans are then.]
;B[dc];W[dj]LB[qi:C][pq:B][jq:A]C[I would do something like "A" or "B". This seems the best direction.

Something like "C" would also be good.];B[pq]
(;W[pp]N[5 (Q4)]C[Maybe a little to close. I have the feeling P4 is better. You could then crawl along the third line and place a stone around Q11 or so. See variation.]

;B[dn];W[jd]LB[cn:A][en:B][co:1]N[15 (K16)]C[You played somewhere else. ("tenuki") In general it isn't recommend to tenuki when a single stone touches another single stone. Usually white would do "A" or "B". (like the proverb says: "When touched: Hane") If you want territory at the side you play "A". If you want to be in the center more you play "B". 
If you play "A", black will play "1" and I think you have to respond to this. 
The corner will be almost settled then and an invasion there will become harder.
