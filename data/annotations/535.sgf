C[
Dear Nicklas,

thank you for requesting a review. I got so many fun from the game of go
and help from stronger players that i'm happy now to give a little back.
Please don't take my comments as the real trues. I'm only a 5k* and so
mosttime helpless by myself :).

To your game:
I think it was an interesting game. Both had the chance to win and the
favour swings from one to the other many times. Let me say some hints for
your play (but keep in mind, i'm only a 5k*): Try to make attack and/or
defence as effectiv as possible. 
Attacking a strong group is just a waste of stones. The opponent will play
elsewhere, as he is in no need to defend. 
When under attack, the first attempt is to run away. Making 2 eyes and
being cut off from the rest of the board is not enough.
When you are the one who attacks, have a plan in mind what to do if the
opponent gets a live or connection. Means you have to gain something from
the attack even if you dont kill the stones.

Now i hope you have a little joy from the review below.

whith friendly regards
Olaf Salchow]

;B[do];W[cg]LB[ce:a][qj:b][qn:c][nq:d]C[the black group is very stable, so this move is not an attack.
On the other hand, black has the move a now.   Never attack a strong group, play elsewhere, there are so much big points left like b or c or d]

  daniel 11k*: hm that must have been over play by my part

i think its not a bad point because:
if black plays a, you can attack at b
if black plays c, you can switch to the other site at d and the marked stone still seems ligth]
;B[pn];W[kq]C[good point, it utilises the white thickness to the left]

  daniel 11k*: what to do with j3?
  daniel 11k*: seems too weak to threat f4 enough to escape by playing h4...

I think its good to leave j3 for a later threat at h4 or h5 or some other]

;B[rd];W[qc];B[id];W[hd];B[if]C[now lets try to count :)
White:
  upper left: 15? its still                     open at c17
  bottom: about 20
  at all: 40 points

Black:
  left: 16 sure
  bottom right: 5
  rigth: 6
  upper side: 8
  at all: 45

but white has weak groups at the rigth and upper rigth, so black can expect even more points from attacking it]

C[another plan for an attack would be to lat white live and sealthem in. Than the same with the upper group and by the way building up a territory in the middle. This would give black a sure lead.
(note:aktualy he has already more territory than white has, so he don't has to kill something)]

Than he fails to attack whites weak groups so white could make all allive and got some territory in the centre. the game was back in whites favour.
White lost the game in the endgame by letting all big senteplays for black taking nothing for himself. So black could win.
True: White could make the upper left corner seki, but in an online-game this can be overlooked easily, so this is not the real reason for the loss, i think :)]
