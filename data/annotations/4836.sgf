C[Hi kagukuk and kaktus,

first, please use handicap stones to compensate for the difference in your strength. You'll have more fun as games turn out to be much closer. Furthermore you'll learn more; in your case white would have learned a lot about influence.

I'm currently listed at 16k so please take my comments with a pinch of salt.

Anyway, enjoy your review :) Oh, and feel free to email me in case you have questions about the review.

/Axel];B[dd];W[dq];B[pc];W[pq];B[qe];W[mp];B[dj]LB[jd:A]C[taking a star point is a good idea, but here A is worth much more as it extends from both corners. Especially the extension from the shimari in the upper right is very good.  I would consider the  star points on the left and right as miai.
This is just a minor fault and nothing which you should worry about at your strength.]
;W[hp]C[white should think more about its fuseki. The marked stone is not a strong extension and black doesn't want to play here anyway. Furthermore white has a very low (i.e. with limited influence) position. Black now has the opportunity to build a huge moyo.]
;B[fd]C[it would be more efficient at the upper side star point. As said before it would extend from both corners and a significant moyo would result.]
;W[cc]C[As black has extended from the corner in both directions, a 3-3 invasion is a big point. But it requires good timing. In this case it is way too early as white gives black a moyo for free. Furthermore white will end in gote. In summary: black is happy about the 3-3 invasion.]
;B[cd]C[correct direction to block!];W[dc];B[ec]C[this is painful for white: already shut into the corner and black projects influence in both directions.]
;W[bd];B[be];W[ad]
(;B[ae]C[inefficient.  a stone on the first line is a endgame move.]
;W[bb];B[db]C[Black: take a good look at what you achieved with this move!

With move 18 white ended in gote, so you should take sente and take a big point (a side star point). instead you gained two points and ended in gote two moves later. This enabled white to approach your corner. 

Or do you see a good move for white in the upper left corner?

At your strength this is one of the most common mistakes.];W[cb]

(;B[eb]C[also unnecessary (see variation)]
(;W[nd]C[not a good idea for white. you should have taken the last big point of the fuseki, the star point to the right. 

You can't expect to live in the upper side (at least not where you put your stone), so it is a reduction move (especially since it is played on the fourth line) and therefore a good target for black to chase.]

(;B[mc]C[hard to explain why this is a very bad move (see variation of w24)]

(;W[nc]C[Wrong. You just made your stones heavy and achieved nothing. Maybe your intention was to deny black a connecting stone at O17. You should get rid of thinking this way.]
;B[md];W[ne]C[white: with move 24 you already made your stones heavy. it is better to just leave them alone and take other, bigger points instead. Remember, while running you gain nothing and your opponent gets territory and influence for free. That is basically  the reason you shouldn't have played here in the first place]

(;B[of];W[ce]C[wrong timing for white: much much bigger points are left than this.]
;B[de];W[cf];B[df];W[af];B[cg];W[bf]C[and white ends in gote again...]
;B[me]LB[me:A]TR[nc][nd][ne]SQ[mc][md]C[and black takes the opportunity! Very good! You used sente and took a big point! The only bad thing about this move (at A) is that you're pushing from behind.]
;W[jc]TR[nc][nd][ne]C[
I wasn't sure how to handle this situation from now on...

This is a doubtful move from white: 
a) the right side is so much bigger than any move on the top.      As it is big for both sides, taking it denys your opponent a       good move. Two good reasons for one move :)
 b) black is strong on the left and on the right of the invading stone. So this is a big overplay. A reducing move would have been feasible but also premature.
c) the marked stones are a very weak group. Adding another (the invading stone) is a heavy burden for white.]
;B[je]C[correct point. A capping move and you don't touch the invading stone.]
;W[mb]LB[kb:C][nb:B][ob:A][kc:E][lc:D]C[a reasonable answer for black is hard to find (and I don't claim I would have found anything useful if confronted with this situation in a game): Whites only chance is to connect both groups. Playing at "A" is a forced move for both players but good timing is necessary if black plays it. I included a few variations (B-E) I played through . B and E seem to be good answers. I'd go with E.]

(;B[lb];W[ob];B[pb]C[black is forced to takes profit.];W[lc]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[kb];W[le];B[mf];W[kd];B[jd];W[kf]
(;B[jf];W[kg];B[pj]C[well, it is a big point, but keeping whites stones separated is urgent.]
;W[jb]C[now white has succeeded in invading your moyo. your stones on the left are rather heavy now .]
;B[ma];W[nb];B[ja];W[la];B[ic];W[ka];B[ib];W[nf];B[mg];W[qm]
C[where should I pay most attention to now?

Well:
 a) the upper side is more or less settled
 b) only white has stones on the lower side and those stones form a moyo
 c) white has a huge lead

I'd invade the lower side. White stones are loosely connected, a successful invasion is therefore possible. Prior to this you certainly want to make an extension on the left side as there's the largest empty space.]

(;B[ng]C[good move, but the extension is worth more points.]

(;W[cm];B[do]SQ[cm][hp]TW[kb][lb][kc][ae][be]C[what about this move?

Well, it depends on which strategy you pursued...

Without both marked stones it is a standard approach to the corner stone. In case the white stone at H4 is added to the corner stone, playing here invites a pincer (e.g. the stone at C7). 
Running is out of question as it would solidify whites moyo while black gains nothing. Your options are either a invasion or making sabaki, both tactics I'm not too familiar with.]
;W[em];B[fo]SQ[cp][fq]C[and it's continuation?  wanted to threaten an attack on d3 and attack c7 group...

erm, your group is way too weak to even think about it. d3 is rock solid (white simply has to take either one of the marked spots). C7 has better prospects of threatening (as white demonstrates with his next move).]
;W[gm]C[easy points for white];B[cp];W[cq]C[how to make life here?? ^^**

well, your group neither has shape nor room to extend properly. Maybe you're able to live with this group, but white will secure territory and influence while you struggle for life]
;B[bn];W[go]

;W[dn];B[dl];W[cn];B[en];W[co];B[bm];W[bp];B[fm]C[this atari is more beneficial for white than for you]
;W[el];B[cl]C[another atari which forces your opponent to make a move he intended to do anyway.]
;W[dp];B[fl];W[eo]
(;B[fn]C[was this continuation acceptable for me (black) ?

given that you had to catch up: no. whites moyo has been reinforced and slightly enlarged. Furthermore I don't like the aji of E7/E8. During the continuation you made a few unnecessary ataris, forcing your opponent into a good position.]
;W[ek]
(;B[fk]C[wrong! (see variation) again you're pushing from behind, a tactic which seldom turns out good.]
;W[ej];B[fj];W[ei];B[di];W[fi];B[hk]SQ[fj][fk][fl]C[right?

yes, middle of three stones is a good shape move.];W[hi]C[white plays correctly: chasing your eyeless stones while invading your moyo. Notice that white uses one point jumps while you tend to connect directly]
;B[jj];W[gn];B[fp]C[it is urgent for your group either to 
- make eye shape or
- connect to another, living group.

your move didn't help with either goal. Reducing the territory of your opponent is a good idea, but the reducing stones have to live.. .]
;W[mj];B[lh]C[tried preventing a link up to the lower white...

you misunderstand your position at this point. White has no interest in linking the lower with the upper side. On the other hand your eyeless group' sole chance to survive is to link up.]
;W[ki]C[see, white cuts black];B[li];W[lj];B[kj];W[ji]C[now your group below is neatly surrounded.]
;B[jh];W[kh];B[jg];W[ij];B[jk]C[the problem was: I excepted being able to kill the upper white group if I play right - but it already lived. :(

yes. Never ever try to kill something when you're not 100% sure that your opponent can't escape or is able to take advantage of your inclination to kill something. Otherwise you invariably end up with too many cutting points, overstretched groups or - as in your case - being on the run yourself.]

Thank you very much for your review!!! ^__^

(kaktus 23k)

- your fuseki was pretty good. no need to work on this (yet). 
- What you should certainly learn is to play more lightly. i.e. use one-point jumps instead of direct connections. E.g. something like white 68,70,98.
- Learn the basic shapes (table, bamboo joint,...) as using them will strengthen your groups and enlarge your eye space. At the end of the game your groups form long strings which don't surround any territory.
- Sente/Gote: You took sente at appropriate times. Very good!
- Influence: The biggest issue for white (besides the fuseki). White 24 is a prime example for this. Hard to explain why influence is useful. Just play for influence instead of territory and watch how your stones are a constant problem for your opponent. You should improve your shape skills prior to learning more about influence.
- Correct handling of invasions requires knowledge about influence as you have to calculate whether it is a success or not. If a group barely survives and is neatly closed in, it is not necessarily a success for the invader (i.e. whites 3-3 invasion)]
