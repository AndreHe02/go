C[Hi

I will try to provide a summary at the end of every stage, and, of course, specific variations for some moves. For more clarity, I'll prefix my comments with R.
Also, please note that I commented some W (white) moves. The intention is to make, as much as possible, exhaustive picture.


Reviewer - Thanks for reviewing my game.
I am looking for a review of 3 areas. I am Black

Area 1 - Moves 1 through 69
I played really awful. I am trying to get my beginning/middle game strategies together but very often I forget everyhing I have learned after being attacked or once in a fight and I go too far trying to save a few stones instead of playing dual moves that both begin to shore up territory and attack positions of my opponent. If you could just look over the ridiculous moves I made and give me some overall alternatives on how I can play the middle/beginning in games in general that would be great. I have done a lot of studying but nothing so far has really solidified how I need to play in this area of the game to be successful.

Area 2 - Moves 70 through 227
Here is where I begin to try to shore up planned territory (middle, top and left) and at the some time attack or corner other positions of my opponent. Just a general overview of how I played here and any alternatives on how I can play in this area of games in general that would be great.

Area 3 - Moves 228 through 331
Here is where I needed to deal with the attacks of my opponent through to the end and I feel I did a fairly good job. I corned the invasion on the top left, formed the needed eyes on the bottom right, and repelled the various attacks into my territory including the two large ones on the right and the top. Just a general overview of how I played here and how I could have improved would be great as well.

I'll  leave notes at the various moves as well.

Thanks!];B[pd]C[Area 1 - Moves 1 through 69

;W[pp];B[de]C[R: An unusual move. Useful in some fuseki.];W[dp]
;B[pn]C[R: usual approach. Various joseki can be developed.]
;W[np]
(;B[rp]C[R: Unusual move. I think it isn't a joseki. Not bad for corner invasion (see variation), but anyway going directly to 3x3 achieves the same result. Also, usually the side is taken (see previous variation).]
;W[rq]C[R: not a very good answerfor W, B should go to r3 (again, 3x3 point).]
;B[qp];W[qq]
(;B[op]C[R: ogeima (q4 and q6) is a strong formation. Without a support, is hard to break it. This particular move is strengthening the W. See variation.]
;W[oo];B[oq];W[pq]
(;B[nq]C[R: escaping could succeed, but the W gets a very strong position. Let them and construct other moyos.]
;W[mp];B[mq]C[R: o3 is not yet alive, still need some moves.]
;W[qo];B[ro]
(;W[rn]C[R: wrong move, better r6];B[qn];W[po]
(;B[sn]C[R: this is loosing the B s4 group. You should play s7.]
;W[rm]
(;B[rl]C[R: q6 group  looks bad, should be dragged outside. After loosing the corner, B should think to another points: extension on down side, or even on right side, like r10, which threats to pull out the blocked q6 and to make an impressive moyo with smt like q13]
;W[qm];B[pm];W[sp]C[R: not needed, could continue to isolate B with r8]
;B[ql];W[so];B[sl]C[R: good sequence, it was possible because W not going to r8. Now it's  time to get the right side: q11, r12, q14...]
;W[sm];B[ro]C[R: not needed, should be kept for a possible ko fight.]
;W[rp];B[no]C[R: too early. The B o3 group still need reinforcement. Other areas are not touched. Probably this move will strength W in bottom.]
;W[lp]
(;B[kp]C[R: now o3 group looks very bad. Jumping at l3 could be a way to keep the group alive.]
;W[lq];B[lr]C[R: is kind of late]
(;W[kq];B[kr];W[jq];B[jr];W[ir]C[R: White gives B a chance to live]

(;B[iq];W[ip];B[hq];W[hr];B[hp]C[R: B should be concerned about his group live]

(;W[ho]C[R: It's time for B to punish the W for not killing the bottom group]

(;B[io]C[R: not needed, strengthening the W. See variations.]
;W[jp];B[gp]C[R: doesn't make any good for B, should be g5 first, and after that g4, but anyway, g2 is still waiting!]
;W[go];B[fo]C[R: B is doomed];W[fp]C[R: B has to make the life for m2 group and after that to make some teritory: d10, f16, q11, plenty of possibilities]
;B[gq]C[R: the started sequence has no future];W[fq];B[gr];W[fr]
;B[gs];W[fs]C[R: and the proof]
(;B[jo]C[R: At least should try to save the bottom group. W playing p2 is killer.]
;W[ko];B[gn]C[R: the B stones has noi life and no force. The play is too close and W should be happy to just not let the B stones come togheter. Leave this area and jump to important moves!]
;W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[jn]C[R: W should continue the ledder, anytime the g3 group can be captured. B has to give up the ledder and try to use the scattered stones.]
;W[hs]C[R: With p2 W can kill the bottom group anytime. The f5, g6 and h7 look very bad, as the k5 group. W has the bottom side and a strong influence for the center.
As a main ideea, the first moves (fuseki) are intended to get some influence. Moves like k16, q12, c6 are worthing arround 50 points. Being caught in local fights gives the opponent the chance to take these important moves.
But even if such fights occur, try to solve them simple and jump somwhere else.
I already mentioned some opportunities usable for taking important points. For sure, I didn't mention all of them.
As a main ideea about this fuseki, seems that the local fights started to early. A quarter of table is already full of stones, and only 2 other stones are placed elsewhere (B stones, that's important). B failed in getting a base on bottom and in making a wall against the upper stones.


Area 2 - Moves 70 through 227
Here is where I begin to try to shore up planned territory (middle, top and left) and at the some time attack or corner other positions of my opponent. Just a general overview of how I played here and any alternatives on how I can play in this area of games in general that would be great.]
;B[pi]C[R: good! It is an important move.
having scattered g6 stones, another area to play could be d10, but in this case d15 is wrongly placed.]
;W[fn];B[gm];W[eo];B[fm];W[nn];B[nm]C[R: not needed. Here B is not so weak.
Because W let B making some strength for g7, it's pitty not to use this group: d7 or something]
;W[mm]
(;B[on]C[R: bad shape. Already B is in lack of liberties.];W[mo]
;B[ll]C[R: wrong, see W variation.]
(;W[lm];B[km]C[R: good: is linking a little the scattered stones. But local gain, without many options. Important points still not taken.]
;W[kl]
(;B[jm]C[R: should connect!];W[im];B[jl];W[kk];B[il];W[hl];B[hk]
C[R: The ledder is looking well for B, but anytime W could invade d10 or d11 and using ledder threat develop a large base on left.]
;W[gl]
(;B[ik]C[Should continue the ledder.]
(;W[mk]C[R: W is wrong, W has the chance to eliminate the B influence for right too]
;B[fl]C[R: welcome to the ledder ;)];W[gk];B[gj];W[fk];B[ek]
;W[pl]C[R: and W doesn't forget];B[pk];W[om];B[ol]C[R: local move. Try to get more, not just local threat. What about p10? And don't forget s8 group: it is in immediate danger.]
;W[nl];B[pm];W[pn];B[el]C[R: not needed. could be more important points, like f16]
;W[pl];B[en];W[fo];B[pm]C[R: local, not needed, important moves are waiting]
;W[dn];B[em];W[pl];B[cm];W[ok]C[R: needs urgent defense];B[bn]
C[R: and B fails to provide it, the B wall is doomed];W[qk]
;B[pj];W[rk];B[jc]C[R: good. Is important! Now B comes to life.]
;W[co]C[R: why? If B continues to occupy important points, W will be caped.]
;B[bo]C[R: good, but not so important. Could be left for the end, useful for a monkey. q10 group is suffering.]
;W[bp];B[cj]C[R: too close... c12, or even better, f16];W[qc]
C[R: now B should be happy. Let W live small in corner and make side points. Correct W attacks could be: r13, n17, q13, etc.]

(;B[pb]C[R: don't go under. play as simple as possible];W[pc]
;B[nc];W[ob]C[R: W has the chance to make a large scale invasion.]
;B[oc];W[qb];B[qd];W[pa]C[R: and fails. This move was not needed]
;B[nb];W[sc];B[re]C[R: good];W[rd];B[se]C[R: better connect: r15]
;W[sd];B[qe]C[R: yup];W[rb]C[R: not needed. B has the chance to take the sente and make another important moves: f16, d17, l11...]
;B[ec]C[R: good];W[sk]C[R: not needed!]
(;B[rj]C[R: too close! Attack at one line distance and deffend in contact.]
;W[qj];B[ri]C[R: the s11 stones are very weak anyway. Leave s10 and close the invasion at r11. q10 group is more important that second line group.]
;W[qi];B[qh];W[ph]C[R: B has to choose: center or side. The up B wall seems now loosing. The important q10 group is on immediate danger.]
;B[pg];W[oh]C[R: B is doomed];B[oi];W[ni];B[mi]C[R: useless. p13 could use what left from the wall influence.]
;W[rh];B[qg];W[si]C[R: not needed. W should extend in center]
;B[nh];W[oj];B[nj];W[oi];B[mj]C[R: another weak stones to worry about, that's all. Let W with what got and develop a center moyo.]
;W[mh];B[ng];W[li]C[R: wrong, should be m12 instead];B[lh]
(;W[lj]C[R: wrong, should deffend.];B[mg];W[sj]C[R: of course, not needed. Again B has the chance for taking another important points.]
;B[ki];W[kj];B[ii]C[R: good. Finally, we have a little of wall.]
;W[ij];B[jj];W[hj]C[R: useless move.];B[hi];W[kh]C[R: useless move. It is strengthening B.]
;B[ji];W[lg];B[mh];W[dh]C[R: and the results of B taking the important points on table. W feels that, against the disastrous B start, the game can be lost.
I would say that in this moment B has a clear tie situation. Using sente moves for gathering important points on table, almost cleared out the W advantage of having bottom half of board. Starting with this point, B should only deffend against more and more disperate W attacks and hope that, in yose, will turn the balance in favor.
As important decissions, the game is over.];B[ch];W[eh];B[fj]
C[R: good.];W[cn];B[dm];W[bm]
(;B[am]C[R: not again! already B was tricked with move 22. The history is repeating. But don't worry, I am sure that next time you'll choose right answer!]
;W[bl];B[jk]C[R: it's a purely yose move. Not important. Limit the W invasion on left.]
;W[lk];B[nk];W[ml];B[bk]C[R: yes.];W[ao];B[cl];W[an];B[ak];W[al]
C[R: and the situation was repeting exactly the same as on right.]
;B[jf]C[R: very good.];W[kn]C[R: yose move, to early.];B[rg]
;W[sh];B[jh]C[R: not needed! the bottom B group is not alive, W can push a little B with o19. And these are the last moves.]
;W[kg];B[lf];W[kf];B[ke];W[od];B[mc];W[oe]
(;B[of]C[R: make link! is more sure and you won't have head ache.]
;W[me];B[ld];W[ne];B[le];W[pe];B[pf];W[sf]
(;B[rf]C[R: why? you loose 3 points.];W[nf];B[mf];W[og]C[R: anyway B lives, W should take what had: t13.]
;B[sg];W[oa];B[na];W[db]C[R: W is desperate. Manage your large moyo and don't be affraid by the invasion. W simply has no room for living. In the corner, yes, if W makes correct attack, let him live small. This wasn't a quite correct attack, but in order to avoid complication, sometimes is better to just leave it.



Area 3 - Moves 228  through 331
Here is where I needed to deal with the attacks of my opponent through to the end and I feel I did a fairly good job. I corned an invasion on the top left, formed needed eyes on the bottom right, and repelled various attacks into my territory including two large ones on the right and the top. Just a general overview of how I played here and how I could have improved would be great as well.

First there was the corner invasion which I tried to minimize rather than attack. Thoughts?]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[ac];B[eb]C[R: good. W should die.]
;W[da]
(;B[cb]C[R: but you gave life!];W[ns]C[R: probably you already noticed, all the game this B group was unexpected neglected! W kills with p2. This move... well, interesting, I think it also kills.
And the W left corner group? W failed to answer, kill the corner group!


Next I needed to form two eyes to stop my opponents attempt to corner my stones. Thoughts?]

(;B[ms]
(;W[ks]C[R: and W gives life!];B[js]C[R: still W can play p2! killing move!]
;W[nr]C[R: and refuses... You have to admit, the luck was in your favor here. But luck is part of game!]
;B[or]C[R: finally, p2 ;)];W[os];B[ps];W[pr];B[mr];W[ns];B[os]
C[R: yes, good.];W[qs];B[jg]C[R: of course, not needed. Game is over! Kill the W invasion in left up corner and end.]
;W[rr]C[R: W gives a point...];B[fg]C[R: as I said... well, the center 2 stones are not dangerous. Corner!

Next I needed to stop the invasion on the left. Thoughts?];W[ci]
;B[di];W[bi];B[bh];W[cg];B[ai];W[af];B[bf]C[R: And you failed to limit corner exit... But remeber, corner is dead!]
;W[ad];B[ag];W[ae];B[be]C[R: wrong, already on that direction W can't go nowhere]
;W[bg];B[bj];W[ah];B[bb]C[R: why? W still dies.];W[ab]
(;B[ca]C[R: but not with this move! And seems that the luck is equally shared! W should died for 3 times ;)]
;W[ba];B[ea];W[cb]C[R: of course, not needed.
Cut W in center.];B[ag];W[cf];B[ah];W[ce];B[dd]C[R: good];W[df]
;B[ef];W[dg];B[fh];W[ei];B[dj];W[jb]C[And now I needed stop the invasion at the top. Thoughts?]

(;B[ib]C[R: don't play scattered, keep the space limited and that's all]
;W[kb]
(;B[lb]C[R: already you have a wall there, where W to go?];W[ic]
;B[hc];W[id];B[kc];W[hb]C[R: well, W is really trying. Still should have no chance]
;B[ia];W[ha];B[gb];W[ja];B[ga];W[gc];B[fc];W[hd];B[gd];W[hc]
;B[ib]C[R: not needed. W could ignore];W[fd];B[ge];W[fe];B[ee]
C[R: not needed. Bu already is almost clear that W has no room.]

[ei][fi][aj][ej][hj][ij][ck][dk][fk][gk][dl][gl][hl][nr][ks]
[ls][ns]C[R: as bottom line, even with the local incorrect moves, B won because of taking the important spots on table. 
And local fights... in time you'll be able to solve them more accuarate. For speeding the process, try to solve some problems. On internet, you can find plenty of them.
And because you have the eye for whole table, you can grow in strength very quick.
