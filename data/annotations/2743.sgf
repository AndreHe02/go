C[tsjanl:

Dear reviewer,

Thanks in advance for looking at this game.

It was played at a tournament with 1 hour main
time and 15 stones/5 minutes byo yomi.

The white player is 9k NL, I am 12k NL.

I played black. I have the impression I was trailing
from the beginning. Because of weak joseki's I was
forced to play for the center, which got reduced.

I am especially interested how I could have avoided
this line of play.

Jan-Willem Swane];B[pd]C[hello i am daniel, danthekyu around the net, which means i am only stronger than you but do make huge mistakes
my comments are numerous and i gave you a lot of variations (i like it when reviewers do it for me!)
not all variations are interesting and some times i just wanted to see where they led!

general appreciation is you do not try enough to have a strategy ie territory or attack, so you end without territory and without having captured

do try to make SOME territory along and attack not just because it feels good but because you have a purpose (territory in another area, building strength but that will help you to do something)

best wishes for improving

C[ok so far]
(;W[ne]C[tsjanl: This move surprised me. It doesn't seem
correct to me, but I didn't know what to do.

DH: yes it is not orthodox, but you have a good answer]
(;B[ce]TR[nc][ne]C[tsjanl: I chose this because I thought that a white
shimari here would be very favourable for white in
relation to the marked stones.

dh: but you have a better answer];W[cg]
(;B[ee];W[eg]
(;B[cc]C[tsjanl: This seems a bad move. Would a play around
f17 have been good? Or B17?

not so bad
continuation is bad];W[dd]
(;B[de]C[that was bad];W[cd]C[but you have to go on]
(;B[fc]C[tjanl: I decided to go for the outside because of
O17-O15.

you have to keep on at b16];W[cb];B[bc]C[??? you are loosing points for nothing]
;W[bd];B[ic];W[kd]
(;B[pj]C[tsjanl: Was it wise to tenuki? Now I think that putting
pressure on white's group would be better. J15
maybe?

good move on its own,
seems ok on the whole];W[nq]
(;B[lp]C[tsjanl: Was M3 better? Or R6?

m3 is better locally but THE move is p3];W[no];B[pn];W[qq];B[pq]
;W[pr]
(;B[or];W[qr];B[oq]C[tsjanl: According to Kogo's Joseki Dictionary, P3 is a
mistake and black should play O2.

do not know too well but because of your m4 instead of m3, it does not work so well!]
;W[ro];B[qp]C[no need to do this now, reinforces white, is a potential ko threat]
;W[rp]
(;B[ln]C[does not work well];W[nm];B[pl]TR[ro]C[you are not making any territory on right side because of delta]
;W[ll]
(;B[mk]TR[ro][rp][nq]C[tsjanl: I thought peeking here would help to create a
moyo above it.

i do not see any moyo around, black open on the right and at bottom]
;W[ml]C[instantly white is off the hook, therefore black has lost something]

(;B[ng];W[dk]C[tsjanl: Should I have invaded here earlier?


yes probably];B[kj];W[jl]

;B[gf];W[ei];B[mf];W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[qd];W[od];B[oe]C[tsjanl: I guess P14 or Q14  would have closed the
door better.

p14 yes];W[me];B[je];W[of];B[pf];W[og];B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[nh]

;W[ld];B[kb];W[lb]C[series of bad moves, but you know it];B[gj]
C[tsjanl: I should have answered M18, shouldn't I?

it is not so much a must to answer, if you really have a strong move to make, but here g10 is not making much]
