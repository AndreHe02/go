C[I'm black in this gabme about 22k* IGS. The opponent is also 22k* IGS. I one but mostly
because I ran into W' territory late in the game. I'm mostly interested in some strategic
advice.];B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[dp];B[qj];W[nq];B[oq];W[or];B[pr]

(;B[qn]LB[np:a]C[Black should move at 'a'.  See variation 2.]
;W[op];B[pq];W[oo]C[This way, white is building a big wall and the entire bottom is being sketched out as white territory.  Black will have to work hard to reduce this.]

;B[do];W[eo];B[dm]LB[en:a]C[Almost exactly the same situation.  Black must push out at 'a' which expands black along the left and presses white down.]

;W[fk]TR[em][en][eo][dp][dq][er][ds][or][nq][op][oo]C[Two questions here:
1.) Should I be worried about the corner? I don't thinks so.
2.) F9 is big IMHO. Could it have been avoided?

The corner is fine.  And yes, F9 is huge and is an excellent plaqy by white.  Now white's walls on the left and right are working together on a huge scale.  White has about 50 - 60 points in this area alone.    Black has 14 on the left and 16 on the lower right plus the value of the black stone at R10.  White is ahead.]
;B[on];W[po];B[qo];W[nn];B[pn];W[mo]LB[nm:a]C[White should just move at 'a' and expand his potential territory.]
;B[ol];W[pk]LB[nl:a][ml:b]C['a' or 'b' would still be huge for white.]
;B[qk];W[ok];B[nl]C[This is very bad for white and very good for black.  White is now pushing black into his territory.  Very nice move black.]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[ql];B[rl]LB[oi:a]TR[pd]C[This is not so good.  You want to attack these three white stones.  This is fine.  But do it from further away.  To capture stones, the first job is to surround them.  In this case, a move at 'a' would be very good.  It attacks the stones and also works with the marked stone in the corner to make profit.  White will have to run away and black will make huge profits even if he does not catch the white stones.]
;W[nk];B[ml]C[very good.  If white wants to push you into his territory, by all means, go.]
;W[oi]C[White takes your good spot.];B[qh]LB[ph:a]TR[qj][qk]
C[This is good.  Perhaps 'a' is slightly better as it takes bigger profit on the right while attacking.  'a' cannot be cut from the marked stones so they are safe.]

[la][lc][kc][ai][bi][aj][bj][cj][ck][bk][ak][ci][ic][jc]C[White's marked stones make kind of a wall.  So do black's marked stones.  Whoever makes an extension in front of these walls first gets the most benefit from the walls.  A move around 'a' is quite a bit bigger than where you moved.]

Looks pretty even.  I'd say black is a couple points ahead without komi.  Try to count it and see what you get.]

Yes, well done for catching it.
