C[Hi and thanks for the review. This was a game where I could have taken a handicap but chose not to. I played well (I think) but I left too much weakness and got reduced a lot in the endgame. But then, I'm not sure how I could have lost less in the endgame. Thanks again.

Sven:
Hi Hari,
I'm Sven and your reviewer :)
For your level a good game with some really interesting and good moves! (In the review I focused on your mistakes from my point of view, so don't get the feeling that too many things are wrong, most of the time you had the right idea but did not gain the 100% out of them, because you played one point aside. It was a good game by black overall)
From your message I read out that the endgame is your special fokus. In my opinion the endgame is not that important for kyu players, since most games will be decided in the middlegame or even before. For this reason I commented interesting points in the whole game without a fokus and commented some of your questions about the endgame only briefly.

As feedback to your comments:
Some concreter questions, maybe with variants that you thought about, would have been helpful!

Note also that this explanations come from a 4kyu kgs player.
There are mistakes that I've overseen and also my explanations are not 100% correct!

Overall:
In Fuseki and middlegame you should check more often which of your groups need really help! If there is non, then hold on and look over the whole board, thinking about a big move that works together with your stones and put pressure on your opponent!
(see point 8 as example)
In endgame you lost many points without a reason by not reading properly, maybe the time was running out, but in some cases the answers were easy (see point 12 as example) 

The interesting and "big" points, that should help you to improve
are mentioned in the following! Note that I have also written some small comments, that I do not mention in this list, because they are not so important to me, but maybe you can gain something of them, if you find them in the game^^
point 1 - move 3
point 2 - move 5
point 3 - move 6
point 4 - move 11
point 5 - move 35
point 6 - move 37
point 7 - move 53
point 8 - move 65
point 9 - move 75
point 10 - move 89
point 11 - move 150
point 12 - 242
point 13 - 254

I hope you can improve a little bit with that review and enjoy or thinking about my ideas and meanings of this game.
     Merry Christmas!     Sven];B[pd];W[cp]
(;B[dc]LB[pq:A]C[point 1
Sven:
Normally black plays on q3 if you choose a corner and the komoku. The reason for this is trying to let all of your stones work together and at the same time denying this for your opponent.
If you now play A instead of d17 white has to play between your stones to attack your corner in a good way, for example r5. And whites stones c4 and r5 doesn't work together.
On the other hand, black can attack the c4 stone afterwards from the open corner side (e3) and has an supporting stone at q3.

In the game d17 is not so good because white can attack the corner (c15) and has a support with c4. And black actually has no support if he wants to attack the c4 stone from the open side at e3.

This is not a mistake! It's mainly a matter of style! And how the game will go on. From blacks point of view q3 avoids complications more than d17 and the game get more uncomplicated, but maybe you like complications ;)

The 2 variants show a possible progress described above]

point 2
Sven:
Well, to see the result you have to wait of your opponents answer^^

There are some possibilities black can choose.
I prefer c15(A). If you have the chance to play one like this it's good in 99% of all cases. In this case it also fixes your open side, that white doesn't want to attack from the bottom against the top left side anymore.
r5(B) or something around is also a very good point because it attacks and reduces the white corner and has support from above (q16) that a white pincer is not that good for white.

e3(C) maybe possible but not the best move, since a pincer and the next moves are dictated by white]
;W[op]C[I looked this response up afterwards and it seems this was a mistake from white. Unfortunately I didn't punish.

-------------------
point 3
Sven:
I wouldn't call it a mistake. It is just a weak move and now black has the chance to get more profit than he could think of before.
Proper reading is still needed as the variations show]
(;B[oo];W[jq];B[pk];W[qg]
(;B[qe]LB[qi:A]C[point 4
Sven: 
weak move!
r13 of white also very weak because it is too far away from the corner. With a large knight's move away from q16 white symbolises to give black the corner as long as black does not play a pincer. That's the offering of r13. But black has a good support on the right side. So the pincer should be preferred at A instead of r15.
see variation];W[qj];B[qk];W[pj]C[Thought I could get a base while restricting his/hers

Sven:
that's ok];B[qp];W[qq]C[bl.15 Should have been R3

-----------------
Sven:
Yes, see variations of point 3 at move 6 .
You have to note, that it is now more complicated! For some reasons we don't know, black could read it out in a wrong way now, and white gets the corner and black outside influence to the left (as one variation show). This would be a bad result for black since k3 of white is in place to reduce the influence and black could lost a big part of his base around s6,s7.
This could happen, but of course it is in blacks hand to constrain white to play as black whishes.]

(;B[nc]LB[jc:B][mc:A]C[point 5
Sven:
The last moves seemed all a bit slow in my opinion. Since the sequence started the following moves are forced, but the overall result seems linke the right side is now in the late endgame, whereas the left side is not even started.
But ok!

o17 is now definitely a slow move!
n17 would be the minimum! I would prefer k17 because B works well together with all of your stones!]
;W[ng];B[eq]LB[jc:C][ce:A][di:B][eq:D]C[point 6
Sven:
Since black is actually in the better position I would play calm and think about A or B to create moyo.
C and D are moves that black can think of but C is slower than A and B and D creates weak group without a base and eyes.

The shimari at A is just too beautiful to ignore for black]

(;B[ch]LB[ic:B][fn:A]C[point 7
Sven:
Well the d12 stone is hard to attack! Since it is only one stone, white can easily sacrifice it. But if black directly attack the stone, white should have no problem gaining profit or a wall. With c12 you help white to get active and use white's stone.

The better way is to ignore the white stone for the moment.
Playing A or B.

With these moves the situation for the single white stone gets more complicated, since white needs a good idea to use the stone in a good way, but with so many surrounding stones of black, white will have trouble to find a good move that helps him more than black. Black is more flexible and can wait of whites action and response in an accurate way.

;W[el];B[dm];W[fn];B[bo]LB[hc:B][ko:A]C[point 8

Sven:
slow (b5), thinking of the big!
Since d5 is connected to c15 a move like white b6 is only small damage. (if white b10 black must of course react in the correct way and defend at b9 not at b12).

So we can aim for the big!

A is reducing whites influence of f6, d11 group and deny a moyo with white L6. It also expands blacks moyo around m7.
B covers the whole upper side for black, and if white does not react and give away sente anywhere else, it provides good follow ups like L16 or e14.]
;W[hj];B[ki];W[ic];B[gc];W[lc];B[mb]C[Sven:
also to slow!

Something like l5 (as mentioned at point 8) still possible and bigger!]

Very forgiving. It is your territory! White should get a tough fight, if he really wants to get something there!
I see no chance for white gaining something big like this.

(;B[lg]C[point 10
Sven:
I would prefer m15 since this is more serious for white. black can sacrifice n13 and maybe black can capture the white stones at the top. Of course this is not easy and maybe white manages to live, but then black should get a superior outer wall and it will be easier for p16 to live.
Still something like l5 (see point 8) is a key point, since it reduces white moyo/influence and expands black

On the one hand it is hard for white to use the d12 stone on the other hand, the d12 stone has so much aji, that it is hard for black to capture it or ignore it completely.
I still think that ignoring and securing your groups at large scale  away from d12 is better than to react directly.]
