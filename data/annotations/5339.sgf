C[NA-Hi I'm Nathan and I'll review your game.  Just to start out I'll remind you of something that has becoming more obvious to me the more reviews I do.  I'm not really that much stronger than you are.  Hopefully I am enough that I have something to offer but remember to take my comments with a grain of salt.]
;B[pp]C[Both players are 22k on IGS server, but as opponent has a + by his rank on the server, there was only a 0.5 point komi. I am seannethmm(black).]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[eq];W[jp];B[mp]C[NA-In general a big move is to extend from a shimari.  A shimari is a corner enclosure like you made with your C4,E3 stones, and 'from' is defined as extending in the other direction than the shimari extends.  So in this case a move around D10 is pretty big.  Often such a move can take precedence over other moves in the opening.  Also, for white to make a move to prevent such an extension (by playing around D10 also) is about equally big.]
;W[hp]C[NA-In general this extension is considered too narrow.  The rule of thumb is n+1 where n is the height of the wall you are extending from.  So in this case the K4 stone is just one stone (if there were as white stone at K5 also it would be two) so the spaces between the two stones should be two.  Of course this is slightly complicated by the presence of the e3 stone but if white played at g3 it would both be more efficient as well as blocking black from sliding underneath into white's eyespace.]
;B[kq]C[NA-This is a good attack.  Very much the way to proceed.  Attacking the eyespace of the group as well as protecting the lower right corner territory.  Moves that serve multiple functions like this are always the best.]
;W[jq];B[jc];W[je];B[gc]C[NA-This is the right extension width here.]
;W[fc];B[gb];W[fb];B[mc]C[White's response to this invasion seemed too weak, and let me take lots of territory. However, he did develop a lot of influence.

NA-Well, what you did was NOT an invasion.  An invasion means going into territory that is mostly controlled by the opponent.  The top was wide open when you played up there.  Thus what White did wasn't really weak, at least as I see it.  It is a strategy of containment which in general is a very good way to proceed in go.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[ic];W[nc];B[qf]C[An attack on the other side of his stone]
;W[qh]C[I have to admit I have no idea how to deal with this pincer, but as I was nervous about white's center influence growing, I played it to try and get some influence of my own.

NA-Well, at this point the situation is pretty specific so it's not as if this would be a pincer joseki.  By that I just mean that you had an idea of what you meant to do, which is a good thing, and you tried to do it.  This is a general fighting situation and you have a goal in mind which is again a good thing.  So I think just try stuff out and try to learn from your experiments.]

(;B[ne]C[this line of play eventually led to these stones being eaten. Any way to avoid this without significantly weakening my position, or was this just a bad sequence alltogether?

NA-I have shown a different possible sequence. I hope you can see the variation with your software.  The first move should show up as a ghost stone.  When you see the ghost stone back up one move and then click on the point where the ghost stone was.  At least that's how it works with my program.]
;W[md];B[me];W[ld];B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[ob];B[le]C[NA-See a big problem in what happened here is that you started a weak group (R14) right next to another weak group (K17 group).  That's one of the worst possible situations in go because your opponent can attack both simultaneously.  Right now the moves white is making threaten both of these and so you have to try to save one or the other.  If you were going to try to save this group, then running out into the center would have been a better strategy to try to gain some eye space.  This move for instance isn't very threatening to white and also doesn't do much for your group.]
;W[ke];B[og];W[oh];B[mg]C[NA-This would have been the right idea about 2 moves ago.]
;W[mh];B[kg];W[ng];B[nf];W[nh];B[lh]C[A fatal error, but white was giving these stones a terrible shape anyways]
;W[lf];B[cf]C[Beginning another attack to close the gap I just created

NA-That's definitely the right mentality and you seem to be doing a decent job getting yourself in there.]
;W[jk];B[kk];W[ik];B[kl];W[ml];B[lk];W[mk];B[mi]C[giving my group at least one eye.

NA-Notice that the white stone at J13 is effectively captured.  That means that your L10 stones are connected back to D13 and that is pretty safe connection at this point.  Of course picking up a couple stones is often a good move whether you need the eyes or not!]
;W[ni];B[lj];W[mj];B[li];W[ln];B[kn];W[km];B[jm];W[lm];B[jn]
;W[ko];B[pm]C[extending to try and catch up in territory

NA-Again I think you are definitely thinking along the right lines.  At this point I think you are winning the game.]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[hf];B[ig];W[dg];B[dh];W[cg];B[eh]C[now the connection cannot be severed between the middle and left hand groups

NA-Notice that it would have been alot more effective to simply capture the cutting stones.  Instead of E12 play B13 atari, then if white were silly and played C12 you just capture with B12 and all three of your groups stay connected.  As you play it, you let your top group get cut off and I still don't feel that great about it's chances by itself as it stands.  It might be ok but I wouldn't risk it myself.]
;W[ch];B[di];W[bf];B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[ei];B[hn]C[if white made all his influence here into territory, his advantage would be unbearable

NA-Well, it's not so much territory for white here, even if you weren't consistently whittling it away.  Regardless  you are on the right track by digging out as much of it as you easily can.]

C[a blunder costing a point.

NA-Again, I would be more worried about the top group at this point.  That is to say:  I think you are doing a good job of taking territory away, and that's a good thing but if you lose your group up top that would be a loss to offset the gains you have made here.  Also, if you play N18 that is sente otherwise you play O18 and cut off the white stones.  So you wouldn't realy have to waste much time to secure the group.]
;W[el];B[em];W[ej];B[hk];W[gj];B[qj]C[NA-Again this is a good move but it also again illustrates the point that you should have captured the white stone D13 and kept your 3 groups connected because in that case this would be much larger.  Now you are still ignoring to secure that upper group.]
;W[rf];B[kr];W[jr];B[rj];W[pj];B[pk];W[oj];B[pl];W[qq]C[This invasion hurt pretty bad, but fortunately I was able to keep the corner group alive

NA-Yes, I haven't said anything about this but this is another move that probably should have had a higher priority.  If you had played here earlier on, you would probably end up walking away with the whole territory you have sketched out.]

;B[mb];W[nb];B[lg];W[mf];B[jd];W[ah]C[Would it have been better to ignore this to make the cut at J15 instead?

NA-Yes it would be much better to have played J15.  How much better?

J15 = 17 points + security of top group

A11 = 1 point

A11 is a very bad move.  It doesn't save you anything and you pass up a big opportunity.]
;B[ai]C[Blocks the cut, but gives white time to save his stones.]
;W[ie];B[ag];W[af];B[ah];W[al]C[This invasion should have been easy to combat, but I struggled to fight off his stones.


NA-  It is virtually impossible for them to make a group with two eyes down there.  The honest truth is that when someone does something like this, they are giving you points because this will never amount to anything and you will get to take these stones as captures at the end.  Now of course if you let him make 7 full moves after this then he can make a two eye group, and in other situations it might be easier but here you could easily let them plunck 4 or 5 more stones in your territory and then make the one easy move it would take to kill the group then.  To see this for yourself, try building a group with two eyes for white in this situation and see how long you can delay responding and still prevent the group from forming the necessary eyes.  It will really make you a better player if you try to do that.]

;B[ar];W[ma];B[la];W[na];B[fa]C[This move allowed him to play a sequence that killed this group.]
;W[ka];B[lb]C[Is there any better move than this?

NA-Unfortunately, not at this point.  If you had played L18 the move before your group would be secure with 2 eyes.]

NA-I think your biggest weakness is that you respond to alot of stuff that doesn't need to be responded to.  Don't worry, that's most people's biggest weakness when they start out in go.  One of the biggest skills to learn at the lower levels is the ability to ignore as many of the opponents moves as possible.  There will be some, maybe even alot that you cannot ignore, but always be on the lookout for ones that you can ignore.  Those are the points where you get a free chance to make big defensive moves like R3 or another big extension.  By the same token realizing that something is weak and needs defense, like the upper group is kind of the flip side of the coin.  Other than that, you seem to have some great intuitions about where and how to take both power and territory away from your opponent.  Your experiment with the R14 move didn't work out but at least you had something in mind.   Also with the extensions up the side from the lower right corner group.  While you left 
 the 3-3 invasion open when you should have defended it, I still think you were going on a good idea to try to seize that territory and you were doing it with nice extensions that did the job well. Good luck.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment your game, I hope it helps you.]
)
(;B[qd]C[NA-This sequence isn't a reasonable continuation.  I just give it to show you  some of the threats you have to work with in this corner.  I think O15 is really the move that stuck out as one that you really could have done something different like this.  Maybe white wouldn't play S15 but even then the Q16 and Q17 stones will still have a tough time making life in the corner.]
