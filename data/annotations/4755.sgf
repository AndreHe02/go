RE[W+51.50]
RU[Japanese]

C[Sean:  Alright, thanks for doing this review.  I've labeled my own comments with "Sean:" to avoid any future confusion with yours.  I'm not sure that my rank is correct - it's an approximate KGS rank and my rank went up to 26 kyu following this game - if you get an idea of my approximate "real" rank, I'd love to hear it.

Although the final score has me winning by 51.5 points, in actuality had black played move 287 correctly, I would have only won by 5.5 (one under komi) which is a bit too close for comfort.  I am mostly hoping for ideas on improving my beginning game and how to react best to engagements, since that is my weakness and nearly lost myself this game on several occasions.  Thanks!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jd]C[limkk> for opening, i think beginner should focus on learn few opening should be ok. I think white play K4 also ok to prevent black potential territory framework to build up. For me personally, may play move like B or C. White A play is too high, i don't think serve any purpose here, and remember weiqi is the game of resource management plus strategic thinking. Every move you waste is the gain for your opponent......]

(;W[jo];B[pj];W[lq]C[limkk> white 6 and 8 no so good. remember white is never able to faster than black.]
;B[nq]
(;W[mo];B[no];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[np]C[limkk> up to this play here by right should be ok, more move here should not be engage since it is still opening phase yet. Actually for the opening phase, not need to have close engagement......]
;W[nr];B[or];W[ns];B[lo];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[os];W[ms]C[Sean: This was a rather stupid move - I was trying to be fancy by putting a cutting move to N2 in atari, but it backfired badly.]
;B[ls];W[mr];B[kp]
(;W[ks]C[Sean: Again, stupid move.  Looking back, I should have probably moved to L3.  This was probably just a result of me rushing myself (ironically in an untimed game).

limkk> actually you should let go this teritory at this stage, play k4 or j3 will serve more purpose.]
;B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[js];B[ls]C[limkk> beaware that black is live as at this move, don't try to waste more move here.]

(;W[fc]C[Sean: Was this move too defensive?];B[fd];W[cf];B[gc]

(;W[gb];B[fb];W[eb]C[Sean: I think my rationale in moving here was that I didn't want to orphan G18, thinking I could retake F17 later by making a ko (obviously not very likely in retrospect).  I assume F17 is the obvious move here?]
;B[ec];W[dc];B[db];W[ed]C[Sean: And now I try to make that ko.  Of course, I failed to realize that at this point, he can simply fill in the ko and I'm done for.  What would have been a better move, since E18 is obviously dead?]
;B[ea];W[cb]C[Sean: This was more or less a turning point in the game where I started paying closer attention and tried not to make any more stupid moves.  So far, I'm being clobbered and I think it's because I haven't quite learned how to respond properly to attacks when they're first starting.  What things are important to consider in the first few moves of confrontation (such as moves 11-15 and 43-54 in this game)?]

(;B[bk];W[af];B[ak];W[ah];B[be];W[bd];B[nm];W[ll]C[Sean: At this point I saw that C9 was a crucial move, but I also recognized that my only hope of redemption was that bottom collection of groups and that the N6 group was in bad shape, so I reinforced over there.  Do I just need to accept the fact that I couldn't have really moved on C9 without jeporadizing the bottom, or is there a way to do both?]
;B[lm];W[mk];B[nl];W[ml];B[nk];W[jm];B[ck];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj]
C[Sean: Again, an open confrontation which I'm not entirely sure how to handle, although I did much better on this one (or at least, I'm guessing I did since it turned out well).  For the most part I gave up on taking any significant amount of space directly behind his wall and focused on keeping him from expanding into the middle.  Was this the right choice, and how could I have done it better?]

;B[hf];W[jg];B[jf];W[ih];B[ie];W[kf];B[ig]C[Sean: This is the second of many kos and/or related ataris which were formed throughout the game and I tried to take advantage of his apparent weakness in dealing with them for most of the game.  However, I still haven't really mastered their use - do you have any advice on kos?]

(;W[bq];B[aq]C[Sean: This sequence was rather frustrating since I was behind at this point and fighting for every point.  Is there a better way to deal with this, or should I simply have prepared support in the area to prevent it - and if so, when would have been a good time for a reinforcement down there?]

;W[qe];B[od];W[ne]C[Sean: This little collection of stones were made more or less by accident - there was thought in their placement but no planning as to how such a group might actually survive.  In the end, it is essentially the reason I won the game.  Can you explain what I did and why it was so strong?]

;B[rh];W[ro]CR[sk][si][rf][re][sf]C[Sean:  Now here I was debating moving to T8 to prevent the formation of eyes.  Since I didn't (I figured it was more important to keep the R7 group alive) he eventually succeeded in forming what should have been a live group.  Was this the right choice?

C[Sean:  In retrospect, I realize how utterly stupid this move was (again with me not paying attention) and that this group should have died if he'd played S3.]
;B[pn];W[rq];B[om];W[sq]C[Sean: This was, I realize now, a pointless move, correct?  Since it has 4 liberties, I could have cut off any attempt to disrupt eye formation - right?]

C[Sean: And this is my failed attempt to disrupt his eyes.  I was almost successful, it came down to one or two liberties.  I suspect the error was move 278 or so - what might have been a better way to do this?]
;B[sc];W[qa];B[ob];W[oa];B[na];W[nb];B[pa];W[oc];B[pb];W[ma]
;B[oa];W[si]C[Sean: This is a desperate attempt to see if I can kill the group - or rather, whether he knows basic life and death.  As it turns out, I got lucky and killed the group because he didn't move to T10.]

;B[jq];W[tt];B[cq]C[Sean: This entire sequence did not make sense to me - did he really have a chance of forming a group?  I assume he planned to cut C4 to distract me from killing it, but this was easily countered by making sure he was never in a position to do so.]

Any advice on any segments of play you see me playing weakly in would be greatly appreciated - and if you notice strengths, it'd be nice to know what those are, too.  Again, thanks!

limkk> overall, i think you need to build up the skill in few major phases: opening phase (your opening is really need to improve); joseki or tesuji (tactics move). With more and more play you should finally know weiqi is not about purely close engagement and fight, you need to see the "big picture" how whole board of your overall position, and which direction to play, where to drop stones...

any how both player have the fair equal move frequency, waste move by opponent is the gain for you, same apply for your opponent.

step by step focus, first build up the edge at the opening, then middle-game and then yose (end game) phases.
hope it help.

if Black play the critical move (critical decision at move 71) as I mention during early game, should be able to prevent right hand side loses, and control the development of the game. any each game alway have few critical move and call for decision, you spot it early then you will have edge to control the development of the game.
