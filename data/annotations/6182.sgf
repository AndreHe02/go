C[At first , Thank you for review my game.
I am Thai people my english is not good enough sorry for that

I am Black side,Whith is my freind he said he;s 25k
I am around 30k T_T sorry for my dumb.

any advice make me happy.Thank you

R: Hi

I am Radu, around 10k. I will focus on Black moves, but also I will note some White moves if important. 
My comments will be prefixed with R. Enjoy.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pq]
;W[cd];B[qk]C[R: this is Chinese fuseki. Not sure if played on purpose. Anyway, it is rather a difficult opening.]
;W[co];B[fc]C[R: for this fuseki, the aim for B is f4. Moreover, W played on the bottom side. F17 is not wrong... Anyway, the opening moves are hard for every player!]
;W[po]C[R: W push is not very good. B should take advantage and build on bottom side.]

(;B[cc]C[R: complicated move. There a complex fight can start after W hane at D17. W attack at Q5 requires an answer. See variation.]

(;W[bc]C[R: W doesn't what a complicated fight...];B[dd]C[R: I would rather play solid at D17.]
;W[cb]
(;B[dc]C[Is it better to play at D18?
R: nope. B would loose the advantage of keeping W weak. Very weak :)]
;W[ce];B[pm]C[R:good.];W[no]
(;B[nm]C[R: wrong direction. Let's see why. On one hand there is the formation Q7 R9 which is rather strong. It has a small base enclosed and has opening to center. Q3 is a single stone which can be easily boxed in with O3, or even can loose the corner with R3. Q3 isn't yet dead, but it could have a very hard time surviving after the next W move.
Moreover, W gaining a foothold on bottom right corner would exceed any expectations. Even if B threat to make a large moyo on right upper side, for the moment it is only an intention requiring lot of work to be done.

And there is a saying in Go: enforce the weaker group.];W[qq]
;B[qp]C[R: again a complicated joseki. W played B17 on his turn...]
;W[qo]C[R: NO. W should be cutting.];B[pp];W[qm];B[qn]C[R: although this cut is possible, it doesn't gain too much. Simply enforce the group with something like Q8.]
;W[pn];B[rn];W[pl];B[om];W[ql]C[R: B has to defend R6 group. Otherwise, W is making a strong base!]

(;B[ok]C[R: Nope, B looses.];W[pk];B[qj];W[pj];B[qi]C[mibtrex: - -]
;W[ro]C[R: W takes it. P9 was bad as been easily cuttable and also because it missed saving R6. See for comparison the alternatives.]
;B[oi]LB[jd:C][mk:D][dl:A][nq:B]C[R: again easy cuttable. Better increase power of center group or play on the bottom side for points, or play somewhere else (A-D). This move doesn't help a lot.]
;W[pi];B[ph];W[qh];B[rh];W[qg];B[rg];W[pg];B[oh];W[qe];B[qd]
C[R: good. Still, B has big problems with the group R10. I would say is almost dead.]
;W[of]LB[rf:A]C[R: W doesn't try kill!];B[oe]C[R: good move.]
;W[nf];B[ne]LB[ld:B][re:A][lk:E][dm:C][nq:D]C[R: rather than playing in contact, I would extens further on sides. See options.]
;W[mf];B[me];W[rk]C[R: W back to kill. Still, wrong move which allows B to save the 2 stones at S13 in sente!]
;B[ri]LB[re:A]C[R: but B misses that!];W[rf];B[jd]LB[id:A]C[G good intention, but... I would play this stone at J16. Why? The group on right is much stronger than the group on left.]
;W[nq]C[R: good one... but still small. B has the opportunity of invading bottom side.]

(;B[nr]CR[rq]LB[kk:C][dl:B][iq:A]C[R: too small. If B wants to save the corner: atari at s3. If B gives up the corner, look for larger moves.]
;W[or]
(;B[mr]C[R:hey, B lost the corner group! Second mistake.]
(;W[oq]C[R: W lost his opportunity too.];B[mq]C[R: hey, from now on who plays S3 wins the corner.]

(;W[mp];B[lp]C[R: B feared to play decisive invasion move in center of the side. Now, the corner is lost and there is no base on the side to develop from. Let's go back to move 57]
;W[lo];B[kp]C[R: good.];W[jq];B[jp]CR[ko]C[R: hmmm, B could escape center. That would be bad for W]
;W[hq]
(;B[ip]C[R: cut would do something... maybe.];W[iq];B[in]CR[im]
C[R: B can jump one point further.];W[lm];B[jl];W[ml];B[mk]
C[R: good, B should have no problem giving up the 3 stones in center.]
;W[lk];B[kk]CR[mj]C[R: this is the capping move used many times, but only when attacking. But in this situation B is defending, B has no solid base to attack.]
;W[nk];B[lj]CR[mj]C[R: hmmm , B gives also the group p12...]
;W[mj];B[ij]CR[jj]C[R: it is not protecting any cutting point]
;W[li];B[kj];W[go];B[gm];W[cl]C[R: this was a wanted point for long time...]
;B[em]LB[ef:D][cg:B][jg:C][dj:A]C[R: big moves missed];W[ek]
;B[fk];W[fj]
(;B[fl]C[R: overweight. B doesn't need this. Other important moves missed.]
;W[gj];B[gk]C[R: again overweight. Tenuki could be played.]
;W[fg];B[hj];W[ig];B[ih]CR[jh]TR[ij][kj]C[R: B continues to add stones to a living group. No teritory gained. It's like playing PASS. W continues to build moyo.
Particularly on this move, I prefer playing dog's neck instead the 3 corners.]
;W[hh];B[ii]C[R: not needed, another points should be played]
;W[kg];B[kh]C[R: it is only strengthening W... B passes for W]
;W[lh];B[ki]C[saxford [?\]: T_T
R: ok, this is .... worthing 1 point];W[lc];B[ld]C[R: good]
;W[kc];B[jc]C[R: usually not best way, but in this case it works because N15]
;W[nc];B[oc]C[R: good];W[ob];B[pb];W[mb]
(;B[oa]C[R: wrong. W is blocked on that direction. The other one not!]
;W[md];B[nd]CR[kd][le]C[R: wrong, W escapes];W[kd];B[mc];W[ke]

(;B[le]C[R: really don't needed];W[hc];B[hd];W[ic];B[jb];W[id]

(;B[ie]C[R: W escapes anyway. B should quickly connect K17!]
;W[je];B[he];W[kb];B[ib];W[hb]C[R: W captures];B[ha];W[ja];B[gc]
;W[fe]C[R: WHAT??? W is in atari];B[ee];W[ef]
(;B[de]C[R: B should accept the gift and capture. B group would be alive. As long as B doesn't capture, B is dead.]
;W[df];B[fd];W[db]C[R: With or without this last group, B is doomed. And that not because a bad playing. Look over table: with B surviving in right bottom corner, pulling out the group p12, living on right side and containing the whole upper side the result would be unpredictable. Still, this is not the case. Why?
1. B missed few but obvious moves (Q2, S15, L18, G18)
2. B chose complicated moves instead of simple solution several times and didn't get them out
3. B didn't act to save the endangered groups playing instead near the strong ones
4. Even there were quite some opportunities, B didn't use the sente but instead added stones with low or even no value

My advices would be to play simple and follow few principles, like: 
- establish life for your groups and try to kill the opponent ones; don't be scared of large moyos
- once a group is settled, play somewhere else
- try several variations, different moves before giving up a group or letting opponent survive
- examine your groops: is one in danger? if so, how can be saved? examine opponent groups: are them alive? if yes, try again to find a way to kill :)

One tip I learned playing with dan guys: no group is alive until it has 2 sure eyes ;)

Finally, I would contradict you. 30k is for those who just learned the rules! You have mastered very well the basics of the game. You missed some moves, true. You didn't know how to be more aggresive sometimes. But I see here "correct" moves, most of them. I can't evaluate your level after only one game, but I would say that probably is somewhere between 20 and 25 k.

I hope you enjoyed my comments,
