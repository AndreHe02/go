C[KGS game. My opponent, s2ss is a 17 year old living in London. He has beaten a number of dan players on even, real board games, and was a challenge.

My game revolved around an attack on a big group, but his defence of this isolated my own big group - I failed to spot the cut arriving.

In the late stages, I could have killed a group on the left side to live - he allowed me to live on the lower side, believing that he had to defend that group. I feel he had time to stop me living.

Zordon:
Hi, I am Zordon. I am a german shodan and play as a 2d on KGS.
GTL asked me to do this review.
First of all:
Thank you for the game, it was very interesting.
I added many comments and variants, mostly technical stuff.
There is a summary at the end.
I am not much stronger than you, so I spent some time with research.
I hope you enjoy the review!];B[pp];W[dd]C[s2ss [1k\]: have fun
CardiffGo [2k?\]: Hi - have fun];B[qd];W[dq]C[s2ss (White) plays this opening in most games. I believe my response was counter to the norm. Not necessarily better.]

I have never seen this move.
The worst thing for white to happen is that black plays at C3 and the result would be a normal Joseki.
If white plays at A however, black needs some plan, because just answering at B will make awkward shape.
The sequence from 1 to 4 is sente for black and should be played.]

;W[dj];B[ek]C[s];W[dk];B[ja]C[Zordon: lets count one more time.]

(;W[is];B[js]C[Zordon:
Alright. This was a very interesting game!
Both of you play really good and I enjoyed this game a lot.

Anyway, both players played a weired opening. Some Josekis have been left unfinished. You should finish the Josekis especially when its sente anyway!

Also both players attacked very hard and could easily have died under a counter attack. Three times black could have killed white.
(top left corner; big right group; left group)

Black took an early lead after the attack on white right group.
After the opening (around move 82) black had some solid points and white some moyo.
Black invaded very succesfully. White became greedy and attacked recklessly. Although black did not kill anything, white lost all his points while attacking.

Black needs to learn tsumego, because he missed his opportunities.
Also black had some trouble with his own eye shape.
White needs to play more solidly and concentrate on his own points instead of playing destructively.

I hope my ideas will help you a little. 
If you have any further questions, please let me know.

Bye,
