C[JP: Thank you in advance for the review.  This game was played on KGS.  I played Black.  Both my opponent and myself are ranked 10k.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[nc];W[qn];B[ql]LB[qj:a]C[JL: I would play at [a\] instead as it would co-operate neatly with the corner enclosure (shimari) on the top. However there is nothing wrong with the more agressive move played.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[pq]
(;B[oq]SL[qn]N[Overplay]C[When the marked white stone is there, this hane is an overplay. White can simply play the variation [B\].]

(;W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qo]
(;W[or]N[Too soft];B[nq];W[pk]LB[nr:a]C[White should first have pushed one more time on the bottom as now [a\] is sente for black.]

(;B[pn]LB[ns:a]N[Slow]C[JP: I'm not sure if this move was necessary.  Should I have played elsewhere?

JL: Usually one answers directly to a shoulder-hit. The move played seems slow and makes black look over concentrated. I would have played one of the two variations in the previous node.]
;W[qk];B[qi]SL[pn]N[Agressive]C[At first I though this might be too agressive, but since you played the marked stone a strong attack seems right.]
;W[pi]C[It is questionable to lean here as it makes black territory. Better to jump out with a two space jump.]
;B[ph];W[oi];B[oh];W[rl];B[qm];W[ri]
(;B[cj]SL[oh][ph][qi]N[Tenuki not possible]C[JP: I felt my stones were reasonably secure, and I wanted to play the big move, but I don't know if this was the right place to do so.

JL: Your move sure is big, but it is always better to play important moves first, and big ones later. You should have made the marked stones strong and kept the white group weak. Now white can make a strong group out of a weak one and the whole balance of power in the center will change.]
BM[1];W[qh]C[This move punishes black for his error.];B[qg]
;W[rh];B[rg]LB[pg:a]C[Now white could and should tenuki (play elsewhere). Black also has a nasty cutting point at [a\] left for white to exploit later.]
;W[rm]C[Simply a slow and unnecessarymove black should ignore.]

(;B[fc]LB[cg:a][gc:b][ic:c]C[JP: Here's where my mistake started to show.  White can respond at C14, starting the pincer on the C10 stone.  I still have to secure the top.  Since I had two free moves, what would be a better approach than C10 followed by F17?


JL: The move played is not necessarily bad, however, you could also have considered [a\] followed by white [b\], black [c\] like in the variation of previous node.]
;W[cf];B[ic]LB[id:a]C[I would have played this at [a\] to give more body to the moyo (territorial framework), but j17 is just as fine I guess.]
;W[cc]LB[db:a]C[[a\] is better]
(;B[dn]C[JP: This move did not work at all for me.  I have trouble against the 4-4 position.  Do you have any suggestions?

JL: Try the variations of the previous node. In general you should not play the high approach against a 4-4-stone unless the center/side is really interesting.

Also you should think what you want in the game, and what the opponent wants. Does the center look like someone is going to make territory there? Or are there weak groups that need indirect defending or that can be attacked if opponent leans against low stones (stones on the 3rd line)? To me it looks like center is rather uninteresting, so a low approach would be preferred. Actually a low approach is correct over 90% of the time.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cm]N[Gives in];W[co]
(;B[do]C[Bad style. Black is only reducing his own liberties while forcing white to strenghten his corner.]
;W[cq];B[ep];W[eq];B[gq]SL[dn][do][ep]LB[fp:a]N[Bad move]C[Black seems very thin. This move indicates that black does not have a plan. Or he changed it. Now the marked stones only exist to make white corner secure giving black very little in exchange. If white now ataris as he should, the marked stones lose almost all of their purpouse.

The only move was the solid extension of [a\].

Remember that one should not try to make territory where the skirt is open (bottom right in this case).]
;W[fp]N[Bingo]C[The only move.];B[jq]SL[gq]C[As the middle right white group is solid, and also blacks skirt is open at bottom right, it is rather pointless to try to create territory here. However connecting at [a\] would have been ridicilous, so protecting the marked stone is necessary. The local result is a disaster for black.]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[ps]C[White should not play here as the group is already safe.]
;B[fe]LB[je:a]C[Finally black stars enlarging the moyo. I would have played [a\] or something like this, but I can not really criticize this move.]
;W[dm];B[dl]LB[cl:a]C[Better to just play [a\]. You are just helping white to capture the three stones.]
;W[em];B[ch];W[jc]C[How you handle this invasion will be critical.]

[ff]LB[ce:a]C[Aji-keshi. You should not play this as it looses points and reduces the number of liberties of the marked stones making for example [a\] less interesting. If you want to, you can always play this move later.]
;W[ec]
(;B[de]N[Bad];W[ce];B[ni];W[rn];B[oj];W[pj];B[ok]LB[ol:a]C[Black loves leaving cutting points. instead, you should avoid leaving them. Also pushing like this against a solid group of stones is not good usually. White should answer at [a\] and then reduce the top right.]
;W[nj];B[mi];W[nk]C[White is creating a heavy group while strenghtening black.]

(;B[nm]N[Very bad move]C[I do not understand this move.];W[ol]
;B[gp]LB[bm:a]C[Big. You could also have considered [a\] to give black group more security + make territory]
;W[eo]C[Not necessary];B[fn];W[en];B[cl];W[lh];B[kj]LB[ll:a]
C[This is very agressive - especially considering all the cutting points in the shape. However it is hard to see what is the best move here - it may even be the move played, as a black stone at [a\] would start forming a nice moyo in the center.]

;W[jl];B[jm]LB[fr:a]N[Very small]C[Moves like [a\] are much bigger - a move at [a\] would no only make territory for black, but also reduce the territory of white, and also it would not only prevent white from playing there in sente, and is likely to be sente.

The move played on the other hand does very little of anything in gote.]
;W[il];B[hj]C[What is the function of this move? Nor does it create or destroy territory, or attack or strenghten anything. Splitting STRONG groups is not sensible as they do not need connecting anyhow.]
;W[km];B[kn];W[kl];B[fl]LB[fr:a]N[small]C[Playing [a\] or some such move is always going to be much bigger than trivial peeps like this.]

;W[in];B[io];W[jn];B[jo];W[sg]C[JP: Here white starts to make a lot of endgame moves while keeping sente.  Is there a point at which I should have ignored a move in order to secure some of that territory for myself?

JL: white basicly had the right to make the sente plays. There is little or nothing you could have done to change that ay more. Earlier on, many many small gote moves were made instead of big sente moves, so you kind of deserve to be punished now :)]

(;W[ia];B[ih];W[ig]
(;B[fa]C[White resigns due to overplay at J19.

JL: white can still get a (very bad) ko, better to play the alternative and extend at d18 instead of the atari.




Summary: When attacking, do not allow the opponent to settle himself easily. Also avoid cutting points in your shape - play a bit slower and less agressively (regarding tactics). You should also hane and cut less - you seem to do both whenever you think it is possible and that is not right - simple extension is often much better than hane for example.]
