C[This is a ranked Game with me (5k as you can see) as white and my opponent (also 5k) as black.

[J\]: Hi, I'm Jorik Mandemaker and I've reviewed this game for the GTL. I've prefixed my comments with a [J\]. Make sure to set your SGF editor to show variations.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dq];W[oc];B[co];W[jq];B[pd]C[This was surprising to me and i'm not sure if i find the correct variation.]
;W[pc];B[qd]
(;W[qh]C[[J\]: I don't like this move, it just forces black to play the 33 point. But the 33 point is vital point for both the black and white group's eyespace. Not to mention that it is just very big too.]
;B[qc];W[ld];B[qf]SQ[qh]LB[ic:B][oh:A][pn:D][qn:C]C[[J\]: I don't like the next white move (A) much. It doesn't really prevent an invasion on the right side, but more importantly it has absolutely no impact on the very solid black group.

I think White can view the marked exchange as a forcing exchange since black is overconcentrated. White can treat the marked stone lightly and continue elsewhere.

Instead of A I suggest B to D. B because a black checking extension to K17 is a nuicance to the white stones at the top. C or D because it is a big point that makes invasions on the bottom and right side more difficult.]
;W[oh];B[qn];W[ql];B[on];W[np];B[rp];W[qq];B[pk]C[I think this is bad for him but later in the game the wall was so good for him.

[J\]: Black should probably just have taken the corner or played a double approach move.]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[qk];B[pj];W[qj];B[pi];W[ph];B[ok]SQ[oh][ph][qh]
C[[J\]: This move covers the wrong cutting point. 

Also note that despite white build up some thickness. It has no effect on the black group above. Hence my earlier dislike of P12.]
(;W[fc];B[cf];W[db];B[cc];W[hd];B[dj];W[gq]C[Maybe instead of g3 attack his wall on the right??

[J\]: As mentioned before you can just cut him. But g3 is the last big point so it can't really be bad]
;B[lp]
(;W[mo]C[I think this splitting move is better because it makes the wall and m4 weaker.

[J\]: Playing M3 here would be horribly submissive and let Black fix his cutting points.]
;B[lo];W[mn];B[nq];W[oq];B[ln]
(;W[om]C[After the game it looks better to me to push at n7 to cut.

[J\]: I agree. The cut gets you significant profit but black becomes quite thick.]

(;W[lr];B[mp];W[no];B[oo];W[op];B[po]C[i made a  mistake with ignoring and lost the lower right side but there is some aji.]
;W[mq];B[ip];W[iq];B[hp];W[hg]C[[J\]: There is still a weakness in the white shape at the bottom. I would defend at f3 after which white can aim at the cut at M7.]
(;B[jj]C[[J\]: See the variation for black.];W[ll];B[mj];W[ch]
;B[cj];W[eh];B[fk]
(;W[bi]C[[J\]: I would play at C18 instead. If black answers this move at C18 instead as in the game, then it's not so clear what white's profit is. 

Not only is C18 a very big move (about 15 points), but when
black plays there any doubts about his eyespace are gone. White then has to worry about the thinness in the center.]
(;B[bj];W[cb];B[dg];W[dh];B[ff]C[I think i made some big mistakes here and maybe i can attack this group much harder.

[J\]: White is actually quite thin in the center so it's hard to attack very strongly. It's probably just best to defend in the center with F13.]
(;W[bd]C[[J\]: This move attacks black's eyeshape. but you can't kill him before sealing him in. It'll get quite complicated if black gets a chance to play G13 or H14]

(;W[nd]C[maybe just at o17?

[J\]: O17 would be the normal and safe move. If such a move is enough to win then you should play it. If it is not then you can try O16, however does it work?

See the variation for an estimation of the score.];B[nc]
(;W[mc]C[[J\]: Sometimes white can defend by playing atari from the other side. I can't really read out everything here but it is a shot. See the variations for some ideas. 

It is definitely a do or die move. The game move has the advantage of getting to the lower left first.]
;B[nb];W[mb];B[pb];W[na];B[ob];W[ep]C[[J\]: This move is more dangerous then might first appear. The white group is not alive yet so black can counterattack.

However simply playing the safer E2 does appear to be enough to win.]

;B[fn];W[ks];B[eo];W[fp];B[dp];W[hq]
(;B[fr]C[[J\]: If black defends the center he is quite far ahead.

There is nothing very interesting in the rest of the endgame. Therefore this is my last comment.]

[rb][sg]C[[J\]: An estimation of the score
White:
- top: 30
- lower right: 33
- bottom : 2-5
- upper center: 5-10
- komi : 6.5
total for white: around 75-80

Black:
- top right: 10
- top left: 9
- left side: 28
- center: around 40 
total for black: around 85

So I think white would be behind here. But there are still some chances. What happens in the lower side is very important for the outcome. But black has sente now, and since the white group is not completely alive he can problably get some profit in center there. All in all I think white will have a hard game like this.]
