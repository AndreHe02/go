C[Hello, Laurent!

I am Bernd, German 2d, HonFu in the GTL and other Go places.

I am not very much stronger than you, so reviewing your game will rather be an exchange of ideas than real teaching. I hope you can use some of my ideas anyway.

Okay, let's go!];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[oq];W[nc];B[pf];W[jd]
;B[pj];W[jq]LB[jd:A][jq:B]C[Hon: I think this game has already become half-way territorial for Black, because White is sitting on the two key points A and B for further moyo development.]

(;B[bo]C[Hon: This looks like honte.];W[mq]TR[dn][oo][ip][kp]
C[I don't know how to answer this move...
(LL)

Hon: I think it is not a very good move. It contradicts the marked stone which wants to be developed.]

(;B[ip]LB[io:A]C[Hon: Looks like one possible way. Consider A as an alternative.]
;W[iq];B[hp];W[gq];B[gp];W[fq];B[im]TR[dn]C[Hon: This looks good for Black. He is out, and White has been pressed quite low. The marked stone has lost most of its meaning.]
;W[bq]LB[ne:A][no:B]C[Hon: This must be bad too. Although everything is clearly alive, White closes of the corner, although there is a lot of potential everywhere on the board.]

(;B[ne]TR[le][me]C[Hon: normally you take one of the marked spots.]
;W[rp]LB[qo:B][ro:A]C[Hon: I wonder if this probe is any good. 

You play probes in situations where you don't know what to do. But in this position it is easy to see! Bottom side is already played out, so invade on the right.

On the other hand, Black can maybe not play at B easily because after m3 the outside is already not so important. Also A (see variations) just seems to end up letting White into the right side. If Black ends up just blocking the corner, then this "probe" might just be one way to enter the right side.

I am not good with probes myself, but these are my ideas about it. :-)]

(;B[ro];W[qo]LB[po:B][rq:A]
(;B[rq];W[pp];B[qq];W[rn];B[sp]C[Hon: If Black plays like this, White has begun to reduce the right side lightly.]
;W[qj]TR[nc][ne][mq]C[good move ! black's "moyo" is destroyed.
(LL)

Hon: But it was not very likely to grow it too largely anyway after the marked white stone on the lower side. 

Your marked stone didn't have enough punch, because White's marked stone at the upper side is too "light" (corner still open).]

(;B[qi];W[qk];B[pi];W[qn];B[pb]TR[ne][dn]C[Hon: Like this you just let White live and closed off your own territory.

But now you also have at least one useless stone on the board and white caught up in the game. Worse - he also gets sente. 

White's position on the lower side is not good, so maybe taking it all together the game is about even again.]
;W[ec]LB[hc:B][lc:A]
(;B[lc];W[ld]
(;B[mc]C[Hon: This is a serious mistake in my eyes!];W[md]
(;B[nd];W[kc];B[nb]C[Hon: This was nice for White, getting sente here for giving away just a few points, also solidifying the top in the process.]
;W[di]C[the result is very good for white ! what was black(s mistake ???
(LL)

Hon: You were too happy with capturing O17. It was necessary to go for more.

Capturing a stone or even a group is usually too small, when your opponent gets strong sente influence for it.]

(;B[ci];W[ch];B[dj];W[ej];B[el];W[ek];B[dl];W[hj]TR[ig][jg]
[ih]C[now, that is white which has a "moyo" : how to reduce it ???
(LL)

You have kind of missed the earlier point where you could reduce the moyo easily. The marked points look all likely; but the main problem is that you still got a weakish group in the lower center.]
;B[jg];W[lg]
(;B[hg];W[if]
(;B[ig]C[Hon: Dangerous.]
(;W[ff]TR[ei]C[Hon: This looks too passive. After Black has run out, he can aim at doing something with the cutting point.]
;B[jj];W[lj];B[ol]C[Hon: This tenuki was too much.];W[jk]LB[ec:F]
[mc:G][ne:D][qi:E][dn:A][bq:C][mq:B]C[black is enclosed !!!
(LL)

Hon: This was likely to happen after your slow connection at J13. In enemy influence you have to be ready to make small sacrifices.

I will stop the review here since the rest is just fighting. White seems to be ahead even if he doesn't kill.

Let's look at the strategical "game story" again. It was not a typical moyo game for Black, because White got to play on the upper and lower sides. It was rather a hybrid between moyo and territorial. White started to build influence with A, then played the contradictive move B, reducing the right side, so Black was able to reduce the formation, making A a pointless move. White even added another pointless move at C, so Black had a good game.

D aimed to increase the right side, going for a moyo, which I think was not good after B had already reduced the potential here. White made sabaki on the right side. Starting with E, Black was too happy to take the territory in the upper right, ending up a bit overconcentrated. Worse: D lost its meaning. White's move F looked nice. The final strategical mistake was G, helping White to increase the top to its full value. Afterwards Black overplayed in the center and died, but the game was bad for him earlier.

If I wanted to line out a few principles - you should try to get a feeling for making your stones work together and prevent your opponent's stones working together. A and B didn't cooperate, so you were able to spoil A. But D also didn't work well together with what had been played out before on the lower side, so just invading on the right was big enough for White. By accepting this outcome, taking all of the upper right with E and G, you built a losing position for yourself. There are too many stones in the upper right doing too little.

This are my ideas about the game, I hope you can use some of it.

Best wishes for your go!

Hon: I don't think that White has reason to be too happy with this!

The corners and sides are already completely played out, so White's influence does not look so effective.]
;B[jc];W[kc];B[kb]TR[ne][cj]C[Hon: If Black just manages to live here, it should be okay for him. White's influence is already limited by the marked stones. Your group on the lower side is still weakish, but I doubt it will add up to a lot for White.]

(;W[mf]C[Hon: I think, White should play here. Like this you can not block off your zone that easily.]
))
(;B[dc]LB[dm:A]TR[dn][bq]C[Hon: Personally, I would not go for a moyo here with Black. White has already played N3 and that area can not easily get blocked off. White can push at A in sente anytime, and then break through on the lower side, isolating your reduction group, threatening it and like this surfing into your moyo on the right. 

Or, to put it more easily: I think it is not so easy to increase the right side, since you have a weakish group in the center.

After White has played too passively two times with the two marked stones, I would consider myself ahead and just go for a normal game. White's moyo, compared to yours, has not yet been compromised; so reducing it now looks biggest to me.]

(;B[lq]TR[dn]C[is it better to play here ???
(LL)

Hon: I don't think so.

With the marked stone White has said that he wants to develop the lower side. 

Your move here is a small territorial gain, but there is a downside to this.]

(;W[cn];B[dm];W[em];B[el];W[fm];B[ej]
(;W[jo]TR[lq]C[Hon: After this move as an answer to your marked stone, White has closed off his shape nicely, and he's also aiming at invading the right side.]

(;AE[lq]LB[io:F][jo:D][ko:C][ip:E][kp:B][lq:A]C[Hon: Let's assume you hadn't played A yet. Would you still take that point?

I think in this position you would prefer to play B, reducing his influence and increasing your own, or C (more complicated, but the same idea), or D, F, E aiming more at reduction.]
PL[B]))
(;W[jo]TR[dn][lq]C[Hon: The downside is you just allow him to jump here which works perfectly with his marked stone.

Probably White will go to work with your group on the left side first, but probably you see that your marked stone came from the wrong direction.]
