I play as black

Thanks for the review!

Kind regards,

(;B[qp]C[Without a stone at Q10 I probably should of blocked on the other side.

N: absolutely this is an elementary mistake mistake in direction no 3k should make anymore. If there is anything you should remember from this game, it should be this.
You block only from this direction with a black stone at (or around q10.]
;W[pq];B[op];W[nr]
(;B[pj]C[Was debating between this and N5

N: Ok here you remembered about the q10 stone, but it is too late now. Hard for me to say wether the variation is better, both are not ideal for black.]
;W[np]C[N: painfull];B[no];W[mo];B[nn];W[lp]C[N: the black shape has many weak points now.]

(;B[jq]C[Maybe H/J3 instead?

--

N: see variations and the proverb: don't play close to thickness. 
Think about why you played this move: did you want to save one stone?? 
Did you attack something with this move?
Do you make territory with this move?
Does it solidify a corner?];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo]

N: Connecting seems better, but this is difficult. It is more important to understand the other (easy) mistakes you made.]

(;B[bj];W[hn];B[jn];W[jo];B[kn]C[N: here you play from the wrong direction, you should focus on securing your moyo. If white captures some weak black center stones, this is not bad.]
;W[mn];B[in];W[io];B[jk];W[nm]C[N: this is terrible for black.

Only one comment left on the end of the game. Most important mistakes are already pointed out.]
