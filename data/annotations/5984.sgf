;B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[oc];B[qn];W[nq]C[Since black approached from inside white's side, I would prefer to pincer, as I don't want black to settle easily.there.]

(;B[pj]LB[qk:A]C[Locally, because black doesn't have a stone in the top right corner, he should settle more solidly (i.e. a 2-point extension at A).  Please see the variations.]
;W[qd];B[eq]C[Better at right side ?

This is perfectly fine; trying to check the enclosure is a far smaller priority (it can only make a smaller extension anyway).]
;W[ql]LB[de:B][cj:A]C[This is very hurried.  White shouldn't be worried about this until later, as there's much bigger choices at A and B.]
;B[pl];W[pk]
(;B[ok];W[qk];B[oj]C[Black needs to extend to Q-7 first, in order to prevent white from coming out.]
;W[pm];B[ol];W[qm];B[qq];W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rd]LB[rc:A]C[I would avoid probing.  Black doesn't have anything to gain from this (e.g. white doesn't have a moyo being built below), so white'll just want to keep the corner (e.g. a hane at A, which strengthens it).

Also, it's better to avoid invading the 3-3 if you don't plan to follow through with it.  Doing this removes aji, ko threats, etc.]
;W[rc];B[ci]C[Good!  On a more subtle note, the extension should be one lower, at C-10.  White has more room to invade now.]
;W[bp]LB[jc:A]C[Alternatives for white?

A is the other big move here.];B[bq];W[co];B[bo]
(;W[bn]C[White should atari at D-4 first. Please see the variation.]
;B[ap];W[dm];B[jd]LB[jc:A]C[Because white's P-17 stone is on the third line, it's important to play on the third line too (at A) to prevent white from sliding under.]
;W[hd];B[df]C[Better at C15 or D15 ?

D-15.];W[if]LB[hf:A]C[The keima (small knight's move) is unnecessarily thin.  The one point jump at A is stronger.]
;B[mc]LB[md:A]C[This is contradictory to the nature of the K-16 stone.  If you're playing on the fourth line, you're not looking to make a base.  Instead, A is better.]
;W[ic]LB[if:A]C[Good or better at L14?

Removing the base first is correct, but that knight's move at A still concerns me.]
;B[qe];W[pd]LB[pd:2][qe:1]C[I'm not too thrilled about the 1-2 exchange.  It just gives white more strength to attack the two stones to the left.]
;B[me];W[of]C[And that's why.];B[mg];W[nh]LB[oh:A]C[This feels like a bit much, and invites the cut.  The one point jump at A would be stronger.]
;B[jg]C[Pushing at N12 better ? White can't keep black separated.

I'm hesitant about it; it'll force white to continue separating the 5 stones below, so it's a bit worrisome.]
;W[hh];B[qg]C[Now white has a chance to continue attacking.  This doesn't help black much in terms of making a base.]
;W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[kh]
(;W[ri]C[Variation better ?

This is good.];B[ng];W[og];B[oh];W[ph]C[Trying to save centre stones seems too heavy/risky.

Yeah, trying to save those would be a terrible mistake.  White is perfectly happy here.]
;B[oi];W[qh];B[jj]C[Good result for black ? Two weak groups connected.

Provided that white doesn't get into trouble with his group to the left, white is happier here.]
;W[ce]LB[cc:B][cd:D][dd:C][jq:A]C[Better first run at H 10?
Could you suggest some other ways of invading the left side?

Strengthening the weak group is much more important (this invasion is premature).  In terms of what to do after strengthening your weak group, A is one of the last big points (but it's another choice, along with the left side).

As for other invasion points, you have B, C, D, etc.];B[de]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[dg];B[eg];W[dh]C[I couldn't find another move that works.

You have to do what you have to do, even if it means bad shape.]

(;B[cl]C[Variation better ?

White is really feeling the pressure with those three stones below now, and has two other weak groups to worry about.  In order to move out the top group, H-10 is important.]
;W[eh];B[cm]C[This isn't too helpful, I'd prefer D-5 locally, but first, how about F-13?]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[hq]LB[jq:A]C[First something like D10 better ?

Extending down the side is a big move, but it's too far (would prefer A), and the weak group on the top isn't totally settled yet.]
;B[ej];W[kp]LB[hj:A]C[After E-10, white needs to care for his weak group at the top by running out at A.]
;B[fh]
(;W[fi]C[What about playing atari from the other side? Please see the variation.]
;B[gh];W[gi];B[gg];W[hg];B[gf]C[Trying to drive black out, while it does allow white to get a lot of free moves on the outside, creates even more cutting points for black to exploit (e.g. J-15).]
;W[ei]C[this isn't a sound decision.  If white loses the top group, it'll be worth far more than the four stones and the left side.]
;B[hi];W[gk];B[hj];W[fk]C[White wants to keep the D6 option open.]
;B[ho]C[A black move on the upperside will win the game ?

Absolutely, it's very very big, but you can also attack the dragon on the left side.]

;W[ld]LB[md:A]C[Trying to save the two stones isn't worth it.  It's better to just connect at A.]

;W[ng]C[Recapping, the important part of this game began with the premature invasion at C-15, which led to the difficult task of trying to manage multiple weak groups.

I hope you found this review helpful!])
