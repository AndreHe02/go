This is an interesting game. Black take the lead in the opening of the game, but misses a few chanses to chase a white group that has become heavy. Around move 90 the game is close, when black makes a blunder which costs a lot of points. He manages to make up for  this by building a large terrotory in the centre after which the game is close again.
White wins by 6.5 points. This could have been the other way around with a better endgame by black.]

(;W[qr]C[This is a good choice by white. the joseki starting with white r4 instead would bee too soft]
;B[qp];W[or]LB[on:A][no:B]C[Normally when this joseki is played, black can continue as in the variation at A, but here it doesn't work so well since white is strong on the right side
The sequence starting at b does not look to appealing either]

(;B[np]LB[no:A][oo:B]C[This looks like a sound move. Playing at A instead, to avoid the cut starting at white B seems too heavy]

(;B[ci]LB[ed:A]C[*This seemed like a reasonable exchange for black, but the cutting point at e7 seems very big now.

This is too close to the black wall below (imagine the cut and push at e7,e8...) Furthermore both c16, and c11 are low. D12 is sligtly better but you should have played around A now,]

(;B[iq]C[*I have a tendency to try to kill everything on the board.  This becomes a problem when it actually lives.  I know that I could have gained quite a bit by attacking the e14 group, but it seemed more important to establish a presence on the lower side before white closed it off.

This invasion is too deep. First of all:  You must keep the preassure up on the e14-group. If you don't think that you can kill it (which is probably not possible) you should at least attack it in such a way that you gain something from it. For example; it might help you establish a base for invading the lower side]
