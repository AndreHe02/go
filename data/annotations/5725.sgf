;B[dd]LB[dc:a]C[Possible also at "a" but Black move reverts to a classic joseki and is also correct.]
;W[dc];B[ed];W[fb];B[ge];W[qf];B[pi]C[This move I was not sure about.  Would you answer at o16 or play like this?
A pincer seems more dynamic in my opinion so your move is OK.]
;W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc];W[ri];B[pl]LB[mf:a][nq:b]C[I always have trouble knowing how to take care of my lonely stone at Q11.
JH : The way to handle it is to let it alone for the present time. "a" or "b" seems to me quite better but the present move is far from bad.
I recomand "a".];W[mf];B[ld];W[eh]LB[jp:a]C[I think this is a mistake.  Should develop his own framework now?
I agree. Something like "a" seems more natural. By the way, White has no weak group ; so Black will not profit too much in attacking this invader.]
;B[ci]LB[ch:a]C[Looks a bit too defensive. "a" would be better.]
;W[ch];B[gh]LB[fj:a]C[Seems in the wrong direction. "a" seems better.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[di];B[cj];W[ej]LB[bh:a]C[Now white has good shape, I think?  Did I do something wrong?
The boshi was too easy going in my opinion.

JH : Boshi is too late. After defending with 27, you should defend again with "a"]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[fk]C[I dont agree with this move as White is becoming strong when he pushes out.]
;W[gj];B[dg];W[dh];B[hb]C[threatening the corner and securing territory.  Too soon?

Yes as it is not sente on the corner.];W[gk];B[fm];W[jp];B[bd]
;W[bc];B[mi];W[qn]LB[jj:a]C[White is taking points and Black is jumping in the center. Of course, White has a weak group but it is not yet clear if Black can take advantage of it.
White "a" might be better.];B[jq]LB[lq:a]C[Not a regular invasion. Black is going to suffer. "a" is normal]
;W[kq];B[kr]C[I this a std. variation?
JH : It looks possible but Black situation is difficult.];W[iq]
;B[jr];W[lq]C[Looks good for White.];B[lr];W[mq];B[ir];W[hq]
;B[mr];W[nr];B[nq];W[oq]LB[or:a]C[This seems to be a beginner move : atari is a bad move. Should be played at "a"]
;B[np];W[pr]LB[or:a]C[Better to connect solidly at "a".];B[kp]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[lo];B[ln]LB[kn:a][mn:b][ip:c][hp:d]C[69 doesn't seem too good. Simply playing "a" makes miai "b" and "c". After "c" you can play "d"  to take 2 stones 52 and 58 by shicho or 65 and 67 by geta.]
;W[mo];B[kn]LB[hr:a]C[Now; should be played at "a"]
(;W[mn]LB[hr:a][fh:b]C[White missed his chance to play  "a", but still the white big group on the left side would be in danger by playing "b"]
