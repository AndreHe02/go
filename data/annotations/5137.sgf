C[Dear reviewer,

My name is Christoph. I was playing White against a 6 kyu opponent in this over-the-board tournament game (60 minutes + Byoyomi, 6.5 komi). In the tournament I scored 3:2 and earned my own 6 kyu rating. This one I lost spectacularly.
I reconstructed the game from my opponent's kifu (=notation) up to move 122, the rest from my memory. For the very final moves the reconstruction is not quite certain, but at this stage, the game was already lost.

Still, this is one of my better games, better than anything I play on the internet. So I'm leaving this pretty much uncommented, looking forward to what you have to say !

Thank you for reviewing this.

Hello! I am anicka, 2 kyu from Czechia. I am going to show you several ideas about this game. I hope it will help.]

;B[ne];W[pf];B[le];W[ic];B[qh];W[qj]C[This is the first move I do not like. I think that White cannot afford to become completely enclose. I would move out with P13 instead - Black has to move out with his r12 stone and White can attack him while strenghtening his position.]

(;W[ob]C[It is not possible to cut Black. White should probably let him to link up easily and create some base to attack r12 stone. See variation.]
;B[qb];W[oc];B[nb];W[qd]C[Cutting won't help, since Black lives easily with S15.

anicka: Yes, that is why White should probably play like in the variation. While White keeps sente in a proposed sequence, here White ends up in gote and lets Black to enclose him.]
;B[og]C[Nice move. It is better to leave White with a small living corner than to rescue three stones. Now Black can attack stones j17 and m17.]

;W[ga];B[cl]C[It is a good result for Black but it was probably inevitable. He used his thickness for attack well.

White did all his best to live.]
(;W[dl]C[My other idea at this point was the 3,3-invasion. In any case,  just making life won't  suffice given Black's influence and bottom moyo.

anicka: If White wants to invade, he should avoid strenghtening Black even more. Tsuke is exactly the kind of move which strenghtens your opponent. If White plans to invade, he should do it right now. See variation.

Unfortunately, d8 even does not establish the White base.];B[ck]

(;W[eo]C[Considering also E6, not sure which is better.

I do not know either. White has two weak groups and he cannoct connect. 

I would probably choose e6, see variation.];B[co];W[cn];B[ep]

;W[gn];B[ho];W[hn]C[This is a nice squeeze but it does not help White to connect his groups. 

White drove the cutting stones against the upper group and made iy even weaker. 

I think that White should try to play as far of the upper group as possible - maybe something like my previous variation.]

Black is too confident, I think that this cut cannot work and you prove it well. I like the way you played it.]

;B[ll];W[om]TR[mn][nn][on]C[This blunder is incredible. I  just didn't see the atari was saving Black's group. Instead, I was afraid Black might find a way to save himself using the weakness of my marked stones.
After I realized what had happened, I resigned.  (I'm not quite sure about the order of the final moves.)
