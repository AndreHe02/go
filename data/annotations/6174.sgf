C[Hi! Thanks for reviewing. I think I was staying even in this game until some bad fighting in the lower left towards the end, in which I was completely lost. I'd appreciate any comments.]
;B[qd]C[Prezli [2d\]: hi
ods [1d\]: hiya];W[dc];B[pp];W[od]LB[dp:A][cn:B][fq:C][ci:D]
[cp:E][co:F][pf:G][ld:H]C[Donal: Up to white 4, this looks like a professional game. Where to play black 5?
My first choice would be the unoccupied corner. However, I would avoid black A, because white B, black C, white D gives White the ideal mini Chugoku-ryu position on the left, which works especially well with white 4. So I might choose black E or F.

What about answering in the upper right corner? This is of course an option. The third play in a corner can sometimes be as valuable as the first or second play. But in this case, black G gives the feeling of Black haing been forced into an over-concentrated position on the right, while a pincer such as H doesn't work so well with the white stone in the upper-left corner. If that stone was black, of course H would be my first choice.]
;B[ld]LB[id:A][cj:B][og:C]C[Black 5 is definitely an aggressive-looking move. But the question here is, "What is Black's plan?" If his plan is to kill White, it's not likely to happen, so the idea is to use threats against White to get something else. He could reduce White's potential area on the upper side, or maybe make territory with sente on the right. Of course he can keep his options open and decide after he sees White's response, but at some point he needs a decision.

As White, I would be looking at playing around A, because this is an ideal pincer-and-extension combination. Later I could the play at B and get a nice double-wing formation. It's common to play such moves as C before playing the pincer, but actually that's just a detail. A is so nice that I might just skip C and play A directly.]

(;W[pg]LB[oe:A][id:B][qc:C]C[White 6 is a nice move. The only problem I can see with it is that White is probably convinced that Black will play A, like it says in the book. But what if he doesn't? If Black plays at B, he has stabilized his stones and realized his goal of reducing White's territory on the upper side. He can still live anytime in the corner, even if White plays a third move there. What was White planning to do in this case?

If White plays a third move in the corner for example at C, he will have invested three stones to Black's one stone, or a net of two stones. A two-stone investment is the same as a white shimari, yet compared to a shimari the corner has really bad aji, so Black can be satisfied with this.]

(;B[oe];W[ne];B[of];W[pd];B[qf];W[qc];B[qe];W[nf];B[og];W[pb]
LB[id:A]C[Black knew it was going to turn out like this, because he played the joseki straight from the book. But is this what he really wanted? Note that even if Black extends to A, the white stones on the right are unconditionally alive, so the value of Black's own stones is reduced by half. The white wall on the right works well with the white stone in the upper left corner. And on the other hand, Black's stones on the right are not alive as they stand, and another stone is needed there.]
;B[qk]C[Black 17 makes a bese for his group and some nice territory, but his stones seem overconcentrated. Yet if he occupies the lower left corner, a white pincer on the right is severe.]
;W[dq]C[I would have to say that White definitely has the lead at this point.]
;B[de]LB[cf:A][ci:B][cc:C]C[Approaching this corner seemed better than giving white a big framework

Donal: Black 19 is the right direction, but a little dangerous because a white pincer would be ideal. I recommend black A instead. Black can next play either B or C.]
;W[ee]LB[dg:A]C[White 20 is of course a nice move. White will build lots of territory at the top, and black 5 will die without a struggle. But notice that white A would also be very strong.. This pincer is also a perfect extension from White's stone in the lower right corner, and a powerful attack on Black's isolated stone. The white thickness at the right makes this work extremely well.

The choice here depends on whether the territory White makes at the top is going to be of ideal shape, or whether it will be perhaps overconcentrated or too wide to be defended. (See diagram)]

(;B[ef];W[ed];B[dg]
(;W[jd]C[White 24 is the wrong idea. Killing the lone black stone doesn't have much meaning anymore, because it is incapable of attacking any white stones. (See diagram)

In Go, there is the concept of tane (seed) stones and kasu (chaff) stones. Tane are crucial stones like cutting stones that separate enemy stones that do not yet have eyes. If the enemy then gets eyes, the cutting stones become kasu, because they have lost their function. Kasu can be thrown away without regrets.

Of course in this case White wants the black stone to eventually die, but he can't afford to invest too much into attacking it directly, because it is kasu. Neither can Black run away, because that also involves a cost which is not worth it.]
;B[ng];W[lf];B[gf];W[he]LB[hf:A][ie:B][mg:C][le:D][cl:E][co:F]
[jq:G]C[These last two moves seem soft but ok, since white's territory has a lot of bad aji?

Donal: Well, the aji is bad, but rather than concentrating on how to sneak into White's castle, it's better to trick him into building it in the wrong place. Note that if White were going play 24 now, he would play it at A, not where it actually is. This shows that 24 was bad, and 27 was good.

As for the aji, I would say forget about it and play black A, white B, black C, white D (although I would consider carefully whether White would really answer these). Then black E, and then if white F, play black G.

The idea here is that when you chose the joseki at the upper right, you chose to take territory on the right and give the top to White. Rather than spend the rest of the game envying White for what he got, just take territory somewhere else.

Playing in this simple way will improve your game in two ways: First, you can take all the time you would have spent analyizing White's bad aji, and spend it instead choosing the biggest point on the board. And secondly, by treating the decision to give White the top side to be irrevocable, you'll be more careful making that decision next time.]
;B[jq]LB[ck:B][cc:C]C[This seems to be the wrong direction - maybe C5 instead?

Donal: Black 29 itself is a great move. The only problem is that you still urgently need to make a base for the stones on the left, perhaps at B.  The attachment at C doesn't work, unfortunately. Playing at A is dangerous, becauase White B would be a perfect splitting attack.]
;W[ck]LB[dn:A]C[With white 30, the black stones are under a lot of pressure. Of course White needs to consider what would happen if Black counterattacked at A.]
;B[cc]C[I was looking at this when i played G14, but I misread (i expected w C16)]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[ce];B[df];W[be]C[Black is cut in two, but he can still live in the corner. But then the black stones in the center are in trouble. (See diagram) Things would be better if Black had played at 30 first.]

(;B[fe];W[cb];B[fd];W[db]LB[eb:A]C[Black 37 and 39 break into the upper side with sente and are not bad, but since you also have the option of living in the corner, it might be better to make the choice of which way to go a little later in the game. Just for example, if you have the option of living in the corner, sacrificing the stones in the center is a conceivable option, but now you can't do that and must save the center stones. In other words, the loss of that option has made Black's center group heavy.

By the way, White 40 would be better at A.];B[ek]LB[gk:A]C[Black 41 seems a bit thin. I worry about an attack at white A. Black is weak and White still has some lurking thickness he would love to put to work.]
;W[dm];B[qq]LB[fm:B][gk:C][dn:D][gq:A]C[Looking back, this is seems obviously wrong. A instead?

Donal: Black 43 seems OK to me... Playing White A now isn't so good, because then black B. Playing black B before 43 is an interesting idea. Because white B threatens both the white extension to A and the white cap at C. And black B threatens the attachment at D, while at the same time defending the black center stones and building a black framework in the center.]
;W[ok]LB[mg:A]C[White 44 is somewhat of an overplay. Black is very strong here, and black A is probably sente.]
;B[pk]LB[mk:A]C[Answering with black 45 makes white 44 a light kikashi. White is free to play elsewhere. Better to put pressure on White to continue an unfavorable invasion with black A.]
;W[om];B[oj];W[hq];B[hp]C[Black 49 is interesting, but you must be clear-headed in what you are trying to accomplish. Can you catch the white stragglers on the right? If so, you can give up a lot in order to do it. If not, you are basically just playing yose, and every point of territory is important.]
;W[iq];B[jp]LB[ip:A][jr:B][jo:C]C[You need to block at A, even though that means White will play B. If that is unacceptable, you should have jumped to C in the first place instead of attaching at 49. (see diagram)

If you let White push through like this, he becomes much stronger on the left, with almost as much territory on the bottom as Black. And the amount of thickness you get may not be enough to capture White's center stones.]

(;W[ip];B[jo];W[jr];B[kr];W[ir]LB[io:A][lk:B][mg:C]C[White has taken a lot of profit on the left here, and Black will probably have to kill the stones on the right to win this. Black A is not sente, so he needs to play a move like B to kill. C might have been sente at some time earlier in the game, but White won't answer it now.]

(;B[io]LB[lr:A][lq:B]C[White has the opportunity to test Black's response with the attachment at A. In this case, Black should probably answer at B to avoid complications.]
;W[mm]LB[mg:A][lr:B]C[With White 58, White has a reasonable chance of escaping. There was no need to give him this chance. You could try playing black A, to see whether White will defend his area at the top. But he will probably run away in the center.]
;B[gp];W[fq];B[no];W[qm]C[White 62 is an overplay. White just needs to escape to win, and he is giving Black an unnecessary opportunity.]

;B[dp];W[ep]LB[bp:A][do:B][cr:C]C[White has played a couple of slack moves, and it looks like Black can live with the sequence black A, white, B, black C.]
;B[nc]LB[me:A];W[mc];B[kd];W[id];B[le]C[Oops, White should have played at 89 himself. The White territory was already punctured by black 39, so trying to save the stone at white 28 was pointless.

By the same token, rather than hoping that White makes a mistake like this, Black should concentrate on trying to kill the white stones on the right, and if that fails, he should resign.]
;W[me];B[kf];W[kc]LB[lg:A][lc:B][mf:C]C[Black can consider playing A, then if white B, black C. There is a chance that White wouldn't answer this atari later.]

[mp:B]C[With white 114, White is alive. So black 105 was in the wrong place as it didn't take White's eye above and it didn't defend well below. If the idea was to defend, then black 112, white A, black B would have been better. White could still die.]

;W[gm];B[fn];W[hn]C[This is a move that I hadn't seen.

Donal: The problem here of course is that you are making a last desperate attempt to win, so naturally it might not work out. The way to win this game was to keep it under control from early on. If you check the diagram, you can see that you might have been able to succeed here, but it shouldn't have been necessary.

I suggest you work on improving your fuseki, and then move on to the study of the middle game. In this game, black 5, 7, and 29 were the problem moves.

Try playing out the opening moves of games of the top pros (ones with a title, or famous historical players like Shuei), and try to understand why they made the moves they did. You don't need to read the explanations; it's better to try to figure out fuseki on your own.

Good luck!

(;C[To catch the two white stones, you need to play black 1. Even without reading it all out, this is a much better shape than the kosumi in the actual game. I have given two variations.

However, note also that you are assuming that White will play at 2. If he plays at 3 instead, he can get away, although the aji on the left is bad.]
