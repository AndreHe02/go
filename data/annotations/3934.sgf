C[Hi ¡ . My name is javi and I will try to show you better moves in this game. I am only 7k at KGS so dont take everything I say as the only "move", but just as a little better move. If you dont understand any explanation, please, feel free to ask me about it.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pc];W[dc];B[qe];W[de]C[In this fuseki there is only one move for both players K17.

When two shimaris face the same side, it is very big to play there first. Look at the variation.]

(;B[cn]C[This move is not bad, but black missed a good opportunity.]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck]
(;W[jq]C[This move is good because it gives white a solid base of territory at bottom, but it is not urgent. He should have played it at top at k17. Look at variation and compare it with the previous one.]
;B[cg]C[This move is quite good because it takes territory at left side and attack white corner but it is not in the right direction of play and it makes black quite flat on the left with three stones in the third line. Again k17 is the only move]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[jd]C[Look at it ¡ Dont you think it is a marvelous move?]

(;B[mc]LB[qj:A][ql:B]C[AKIMATSU: better at A or B?

JAVI: N17 is a good extension but now it is very late. It is only two space jump so it is quite small.

Black has other options for playing. Look at variations.];W[nq]
;B[np]LB[qi:A][qj:B][qk:C][ql:D]C[AKIMATSU: is this bad in this situation? i think it would be fine if there was a stone around A-D but i'm not sure since there isn't any.

JAVI: I think it is good. As you say, if there is a black stone at any point A-D it would be even better. But the usual continuation should be fine for black.]

(;W[qn]C[I think this is an overplay by white.]
(;B[qj];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]C[aji-kehsi?

JAVI: I think it is playable here.];W[or];B[op];W[rp]
(;B[rq]C[I think this is the mistake.

After you played r10, you should take the right side and not the corner. Look at the variation.]
;W[rr]C[You still have the chance to take the right side with s5.]
;B[nr];W[ro];B[pr];W[qr];B[os];W[ql]C[Look at the result: 

White has got the corner and some points at the right side where black could have make a big territory.

Black has made a small group, not totally safe yet, and he dont have any chance to attack any white group in the area.

So this is a big failure for black.]
(;B[oj]C[anywhere more important?

JAVI: P10 is a quite big move but it is gote.

Black has another options like invading at h17 or h3.];W[le]
C[White tries to reduce black territory]
(;B[ge]C[I dont like g15 because it looks like a "half hearted" move.

If black wants to attack k16 and m15 he should separate those stones from the corner and then the move should be g16.

If black wants to invade white territory, I would have played at h17, for example.

With g15 black didnt achieved neither.];W[gc];B[ef]C[Black connects but it is gote ...]
;W[ne]C[white reduce black territory more deeply and he creates possibilities for more problems in the future for black.]
;B[nm]C[I dont undestand the meaning of this move. It dont makes territory, it dont defends properly.

If black thinks his r10-p10 stones are weak, He should defend at q13 securing territory.

If he thinks the problem is at the bottom, he should play at m3.]
;W[lq]C[The vital point.];B[mq];W[lo];B[lm]C[I dont know what is black trying to achieve here.

Black has almost a big moyo at left side, so the best move should be to develop his moyo while reducing white´s. So e6 or near it  is the right spot.]
;W[en]C[Good move ¡];B[fk]LB[ek:A]C[AKIMATSU: too wide? is A better?

JAVI: I think it is good because black e14-g15 are strong.

Do you see now the importance of playing e6?];W[cm];B[dm];W[dn]
;B[bm];W[co];B[bn];W[em];B[dl]C[Well done ¡

You have tackled with white attack very well but white has got a deeper moyo now.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[hg]
(;B[gg]C[Why not at g12?

You should alway think about jumping ahead your opponent. Be aware , not always is good ¡]

;W[fc]
(;B[ed]C[This move IS aji-keshi. Look at the variation.];W[dd]
;B[ec]C[is the last few moves aji-keshi?];W[eb]C[Here white looks weak to me, lets see it ...]

(;B[hh];W[he];B[ih];W[jm];B[jk]C[This move tries to make too many things at the same time.

I like much more h9 or L6 getting into white moyo.];W[mh];B[mj]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[lj]C[It is not needed m10. Black can connect at o6 or n6 and q13. So he should not defend yet.]
;W[jj];B[ij];W[ik]C[Black should simply take territory with an atari at h9. Look the variation.]

(;B[kj];W[jl];B[ji]C[This is not the important direction of play.]
;W[hj]C[This is ¡];B[jk];W[el];B[ek];W[fl];B[hk];W[jj];B[bf]
;W[be];B[jk];W[hl];B[il];W[im];B[gl]C[This move shows a good fighting spirit but black should just connect the ko.]
;W[ik];B[hd];W[gk];B[gj]C[This is a sad situation :(

You have made a threat and when white ends the ko, you cant even take the threat ...

If losing the ko is that big, you should not start it.];W[gm]
;B[gi];W[hc];B[id];W[ie];B[gd];W[ic];B[og]C[This is a very big move that should have been played before.]

I felt like i played fine but i still lost by quite a lot. If there are any important moves that i haven't realized, or played at the wrong time, it would be helpful if you could explain it.

P.S
I also have a problem sometimes (and realize after i did it). play sometimes thinking this move shouldn't be bad. Then after i play it, i think about it and realize that it was a horrible move, and that i missed something very obvious. I realize i sometimes make the move then think about it, instead of thinking about it before hand. If there is any advice you can offere me, i would be greatful.

Thank You
Akimatsu

JAVI:

As you have said, you have not made any very bad mistake but I think you should improve the direction of play and, in my opinion even more important, to keep sente and dont make moves without meaning. Always check that your move has a good continuation if your opponent dont answer it.

Try to get moyos based on your shimaris because they are the biggest and easiest to build.]
