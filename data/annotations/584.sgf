;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[jd]C[FB: After Q3 I was bracing myself to play against  the chinese fuseki. So I expected Q9 now.]
;W[po]C[An alternative here could be somewhere around R10.]
;B[oo]C[Black should consider a pincer here, for instance at r7. This would work well with the KQ16 stones.]
;W[on];B[op];W[pm];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn]LB[qi:A][mn:B][ql:C]
C[This move doesn't do much, it should be at A or B. I think I would prefer A in this case, since it's a big point for both sides here.
White need not fear Black S6, he simply answers at C.];B[nn]
;W[nm];B[mn];W[jp]C[FB: I wanted to have this point badly, but didn't dare to  take it earlier in the struggle.

Well, it could in fact have been played instead of S6...];B[lp]

(;W[qf]LB[qi:A][pf:B]C[FB: I realized I would be pincered here, but playing R12  instead felt a bit meek. I didn't like what happened in the  game though. What would have been my best option  here?

I think R14 is ok. Holding back all the way to A is an alternative, as is B. (See variations.)]
;B[qh];W[qj]C[FB: Would something like P14 or Q13 have been better  here?

No, I think this is necessary. The white wall will not be completely safe if Black manages to build some strength around R12.]
;B[pf]
(;W[pe]C[FB: I was expecting an atari at R16, w extends to P14, b  connects at R17 and w Q13 (picking up the Q14 stone in a  ladder).

Since the ladder favours White, Black can't play that way. And when Black plays P15 it's hard to find a really good continuation for White.
So, I think the best approach here is to switch to the upper side with O17 instead.]
;B[oe];W[pg]C[FB: Better connect at R15 immediately and try to live on  the side?

It's seem to be a problem either way, the real problem was White Q15.]
;B[of]C[Black should capture instead.];W[qe]
(;B[oh]C[A peculiar move. Black should either block the corner with R16, or pick a fight  with R13. (See variations.)]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[qg];B[hp];W[jn];B[hn]
(;W[qi]C[FB: Painful, but I thought I needed it.

It is an important point, but there are other, more indirect ways of exploiting it. Starting with P13 for instance. (See variation.)]
;B[oi];W[dj]C[Big point, good move.];B[dn]C[I think maybe C6 or C3 is better.]
;W[cn];B[co]C[FB: This hane looked unreasonable, but I failed to take  advantage of it. Where did I go wrong here, or was it  reasonable after all?]
;W[do];B[cm];W[bn];B[bp];W[dm];B[en];W[cl];B[em];W[bm];B[cq]

(;W[el]C[This is not urgent. D3 is the move here. (See variation.)]
;B[gl]C[Black D3 is much bigger. Another point is of course F17.]
;W[gc]C[Another good point.];B[jl]C[FB: Meaning w 54 should have been here :-)

Well, maybe, but not necessarily. The K-stones are rather heavy, mostly a burden for White. I would consider sacrificing them (and playing D3 instead. :)]
;W[km];B[mm];W[kl];B[nl]C[FB: I probably shouldn't have answered this, right?

White can play L9 now, but the result will be about the same as in the game. We can now see how cumbersome the K-stones are.]
;W[ol];B[nk];W[kk];B[jk];W[jj]C[FB: Desparate, I figured that if I just kept extending it  would be an easy capture for b (because of L16).
But I didn't have an answer to the expected cut at L10,  just hoping to complicate things.]
;B[im]C[Black is overly cautious, this is not necessary. He has to cut of course.]
;W[ki];B[ge]C[This is good, attacks the K10 stones. White should perhaps not answer this (or rather, answer it at H11 for instance).]
;W[fd];B[dq];W[ik]C[FB: Better to jump to H11 or something like that?

Yes.];B[hi];W[ii];B[hj];W[hk];B[gk];W[ih];B[lj];W[kj];B[li]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[gg];B[fh];W[hf];B[jg];W[he];B[kh];W[fj];B[gj]
;W[qd]C[It's still possible to first push at P13, and then cutting at P16 instead.]

;B[be];W[bd]C[Black overplayed and gave away a few stones, unecessarily.]
;B[cg];W[dh]C[FB: I should have just played B10 and forced b to play  here.]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[bc];B[hc];W[hd];B[ic];W[ij]C[FB: I thought I needed this connection to attack the LL.

There is no attack against the LL.];B[ep];W[fm];B[fl];W[il]
;B[eo]C[A mistake, capturing the wrong stones. Should be at F6.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[hl];B[fn];W[fk];B[jm];W[gn];B[go];W[al]C[-1 point in sente. The end-game move here is A9.]
;B[aj];W[og];B[ng];W[nf]C[Good, still some bad aji for Black here...]

(;B[le]C[If Black plays N18 first, I don't think White can capture, and maybe not even get away himself. (See variation for one possible line, assuming white really tries to capture.)]
;W[mb];B[oa];W[ke]C[FB: Too greedy, I should have taken the O18 group.]

;B[id];W[la]C[FB: I could find no other solution than fight this ko.]
;B[lb];W[na];B[fb]C[Black should simply play L19.];W[hb]C[FB: Connecting the ko doesn't work (w N19, b  L19, w M17, b K17 and w is caught in a snapback).]
;B[ma]C[Should be J18.];W[ho]C[FB: I should have connected at M17, I think I could still  have won the capturing race with the H17 group.]
