AN[game for review  by GTL]

C[NateEdward: This is a game from IGS sent by me, NateEdward to be reviewed by the Go Teaching Ladder. I have been playing go for two weeks, and this is likely to be the closest game I'll have for a while, ending with a 7.5 difference in my favor. Other than my idiocy about whether diagonal connections counted for territory, I'd like to know what I could improve on from this game.

--

Hi NateEdward, 

In the first few weeks of playing Go, one leans a lot of new things quickly, so I hope that I still was able to point out something in this review which you haven't figured out by yourself yet ;\]

My biggest advice to you is to play in accordance with shygost's "list". It consists of three questions, which you should ask yourself in this order:

1) Do I have weak groups? (If you have, defend)
2) Does the enemy have weak groups? (If he has, attack)
3) Where are the big points? (Play there).

Notice that defese comes before attack in Go. This is because attacks can only be effective when you have a solid position.

Determining if a weak group is weak or strong requires reading skill. Therefore, it is important to do Go problems often.

You should not start fights unnecessarily. In this game, at an early stage you created a weak group, and your opponent profited greatly from it. This is because your cut was unreasonable -- you cut a strong group.

Try not to fight in the early stages of the game. usually there are a lot of open areas left, so you actually do not *have to* fight. First play the big points, before embarking on invasions or attacks (unless the opponent has a weak group, but that was not the case in your game).

Also, both you and your opponent made the fundamental beginner's mistake of playing small moves, when you could have played big ones. Try to estimate what a move exactly does for you. And - this is very important - after each move of your opponent, ask yourself the question if you really have to reply to it. perhaps there is a much more profitable point on the board ot be taken ! Don't defend 4 points, when you can make 30 somewhere else !

Around A is the last open area of the board, so you should be playing there. The same applies to white.]
;W[kp]
(;B[iq]LB[pj:A]TR[hp][jq]C[
There are various things to be said about this opening, but I think for your level it is most important to focus on the major mistakes, and this is the first one.

In the opening, you should make a sketch of your territory, which means that you should play in the open areas first. The exception to this rule is that urgent moves come before big moves. This move, however, is not urgent. The way to check that is to read if your group is actually weak there - can white attack it ? See the variations.

Urgent moves are ones which defend your weak groups, and which attack weak groups of the enemy. Therefore, you should actually go over this list of questions before you place a stone:

1) Do I have weak groups? (If you have, defend)
2) Does the enemy have weak groups? (If he has, attack)
3) Where are the big points? (Play there).

(The list is courtesy of shygost :\] )

You should have taken the first possible opportunity to play the large open area on the right. The same holds for white.

Try not to play a lot of stones in a small area like this in fuseki (the opening). You have spent three moves, making around 20 points on the bottom side. With just *one* move around A, you could *claim* the whole right side (it would not yet really be yours, but your opponent would have to try to reduce it).]
;W[jp];B[ip]LB[pj:A]TR[hp][iq]C[
This is a bad move. It does not gain anything, and you are just bumping into white's stones. White should ignore this and play in the large area around A.

The marked stones form a basic bad shape, the "empty triangle". There are specific reasons as to why this is a bad shape, which I will not go into here (you can ask me about it on KGS).  There is a proverb which says that a beginner can get 5 stones stronger if he learns not to play the empty triangle. So don't do it ! Just don't play this shape !

The empty triangle occured several times in this game, which is symptomatic for low kyu games.]
;W[ho];B[jo]LB[ho:B][mp:A]C[
Ok.

Let us evaluate what black is cutting here. White's A group is relatively strong; the stones are more or less connected, and if they have to they can make a base in the corner.

The B group consists of 2 stones, and can be easily given up by white (it would not be a huge loss).

Therefore, it is not clear what black will gain from this fight.

An important principle in Go is that you should not fight if you do not have to. In this position, there are still a lot of large points to be taken. You should take the first opportunity you can to play in the large open area on the right side, and the same holds for white.

What do you want to achieve with this cut? It will not be easy to catch the white 2 stones, and even if you do, the profit will not be big. The other white stones are very strong and killing them is impossible -- it is your lonely black stone which is weak.

Try to remember the following principles:

1 - When you fight, you shoud usually have some friends (stones) nearby to help you with the fight. Your stone is lonely here.

2 - Try to take the big points, and make stable groups, before fighting.]

;W[lp];B[gq];W[on]LB[jn:B][jo:A][mp:C]C[
This is a good point to evaluate what you have gained with the cut. Your escape has given white excellent opportunity to solidify his group in the lower right (C group). Moreover, he has built nice thickness in the center (B group). It will not be easy for you anymore to build a moyo (large framework) in the center anymore.

Black, on the other hand, has played a lot of moves which do not make any territory (the A group). His group has escaped, but what has he gained by it? Those stones are not making any points !

The A stone did not cut two weak groups, but cut two stones and a strong group. It was therefore not a good attack. A much better idea would be justr to give it up, and play in the large area, building a large framework.]

;B[sq];W[so];B[nq]C[NateEdward: Clearly there was a specific point that I should have noticed that group was unsavable. I'd be interested to know if there was a point at which it could have made it out alive.

--

ignus: As I hope is apparent now, these are the wrong questions to ask :\]

Even if you would have made it out alive, white would have gotten a lot of profit from the fight, while you would get only a snake of stones on dame-points.

Try not to cut strong groups. Your cutting stones will themselves become a weak group - which is exactly what happened in the game - ready for the opponent to abuse. He maybe won't catch them, but will gain a lot of profit in the meantime.

Concentrate on making territory. Fight only when it is necessary (that is, when you are behind on points).]
;W[sr];B[mq]CR[nq]LB[mc:D][pc:H][je:G][cf:A][df:C][qf:E][cg:B]
[cn:F]C[
This is a very small move. Now that white has captured your group, the circled stone is meaningless. Compare how much territory you can make by playing at any of the indicated points, and compare that to what you gain by playing this move.]
;W[lq]C[
The same reasoning applies to your opponent. White should have ignored your move and played a large point herself.]
;B[lr];W[nr];B[mr];W[ms];B[kr];W[fp]C[
Now suddenly white is creating a weak group for you to exploit, while it is not clear what she will get out of it...]
;B[ep];W[fo]
(;B[gn];W[fn]
(;B[gm]CR[go]C[
This is the wrong idea. White's stones will not be easy to kill. You should have seen that the circled stone, even though it is a cutting stone, is not very important for you. See the variations.]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gl]C[
Ouch ! Each hane (diagonal contact move) creates a cutting-point, so you have to read if the opponent can cut you or not.]
;B[ls]CR[fq]C[
I don't understand this move. You should have played at the circled spot, connecting your groups and taking territory at the bottom - this is absolutely urgent now. If white plays there, your groups are cut.]
;W[ns]C[
Oops! White should have, of course, ignored your move.];B[cf]
CR[fq]C[
These are the big points which should have been played much earlier. However, now you really have to play at the circled point. It will be a massacre if white plays there. Try to keep your groups connected!]
;W[or]CR[fq]C[
Very small,  and gote. White should have played at the circled point, creating trouble for your groups, and not defend 6 lousy points in gote.]
;B[fe]LB[mc:E][qf:D][qg:F][cm:C][dn:A][fq:B]C[
A strange move. White has gained massive influence in the center after killing your group, so you cannot hope to build a large territory there. Compare how much more profit the marked points would give you, than the move which you played.]

;W[oi];B[qk];W[ph];B[qh];W[rk];B[rj]LB[qi:A]C[
This is a mistake. You should have connected at A. White can capture your stones (see variation).]

(;W[pg]C[
White lets you get away with it.];B[rl];W[qg];B[ri];W[rh];B[qi]
;W[rg];B[sh]C[
This move does not gain much for you. You should be very worried about your top right corner now.]
;W[sg];B[si];W[rm]C[
Also small. White should attack your corner.];B[sk];W[sm];B[sl]
;W[bf]LB[lc:B][oc:C][qg:A][fq:D]C[
Not taking into account the cut at D, white should attack the top right now. He as a lot of thickness at A, and a group at B he can use. Black should defend the top right as quickly as possible with a move around C. Even bigger than this is the humongously big point D, which is sitting there, vacant for dozens of moves.

The actual sequences played in the next 20 or so moves are tiny compared to these points. You are fighting over 10 points, and often even less, while the marked areas are as large as 30 points (top right) or even more (the cut at D can endanger black's groups).]
;B[bg];W[af];B[ag];W[fk];B[be]C[
Now, How much will you gain by this? 4 points in gote.

Almost each other sensible move on the board is larger than this :\]]

White should have taken sente here.]

? Very ugly - another empty triangle. 

I don't understand this move.];W[fb];B[fa];W[ea];B[ga];W[eb]

White should have attacked that corner as fast as she could, and black should have defended here (your move is fine), as fast as possible.]

;W[mb];B[oa];W[mc];B[na];W[la];B[pa];W[ob];B[oc]C[
Both yours and white's moves are meaningless, since the black group has a lot of space in the corner.]

Oops !];W[sc];B[md]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[

;W[se];B[sf];W[rf];B[qa]C[NateEdward: Likely another section I shouldn't have lost. Help on how I should have retrieved that corner would be very helpful.

ignus: The corner is quite small, and you have gotten a lot of profit from your kill, so you should be satisfied. Don't worry about losing three stones.]
;W[sd]C[
This is unnecessary - white passes.];B[pb]C[
You might just as well have clicked the "pass" button :\] One free move for white...

Try to keep cool, even after fighting, and not make mistakes like this.]
;W[el];B[dl]C[
Good move. You are (finally) building some points on the left side.]
;W[eo]C[
This is a very bad move by white. It is an empty triangle. It does absolutely nothing for her, and just invites you to link up your stones.]
;B[do]CR[cn]TR[fq]C[
Good, but around the circled point would be better.

However, it is still *absolutely urgent * to play at the triangled point !!! :\]]
;W[hm]C[
Now white passes. Those stones were already dead, white is just adding one more stone inside her territory. So not only is this a pass, but she is giving you one point for free.]
;B[fq]C[
FINALLY !! For almost 100 turns white had the chance to shred you to pieces here... With experience, you will learn to appreciate points like this :\]]
;W[hn]C[
This is nonsense of course.];B[hj]TR[cm][dm][cn][dn]C[

NateEdward: Thanks to any review I get, this will be my first with the Go Teaching Ladder. Any help is appreciated, I'm still very new to the game.

ignus: This was a fun game to review. I think that if you keep on playing, the things I pointed out will become obvious to you in a very short time. Progress in Go in the first few months is usually very rapid. My advice to you is to play a lot of games, and then look them over. I'm sure a lot of the mistakes you made here, you could have found by yourself. Your skill should go up quite quickly.

If you have questions or comments, you can find me on KGS as "ignus".
