Hi Fox007! My name is David Adams, and I'm currently ranked 5 kyu on KGS.  I think I'm a bit weaker than that, probably 7 kyu.  Anyway, I don't promise I'll be giving you perfect advice, but hopefully it's something you can use.

If you have any questions about my review, feel free to email me at dave@stuffeddog.com.

Overall, you played fine, there are lots of times when I felt you made tiny moves that could have waited, but that's something you'll feel out as you improve.  As for your question about the invasion at the end, you did stop it quite convincingly!  The result of that invasion was not negative for you in any way.

As for the top of the board, I think you need to focus more on living and most of all staying connected and free to escape.  I've put relevant comments in the game itself.]

This move is getting a little high up.  You might have done better to split White by playing at G16, or best, just developing near one of the open star points, or even something thick like Q17 or D17.]

This is an unorthodox pincer.  I've marked the more usual candidates.  Any of the triangle moves are better here.  I particularly like C8 or C9 because of your influence in that direction from the square stones.]
;W[dn];B[ep];W[bp];B[bm]C[dave>
This jump so low and so close to white's two-stone wall is much too vulnerable.]

White didn't take advantage of your weakness, fortunately for you.]

This move is too heavy.  The immediate threat isn't there, so  you should play more broadly now (triangles) or improve your solidity elsewhere (squares).]
;W[cq];B[an]C[dave>
More tiny moves.  Save these plays (esp on the first line) for much later unless you are trying to save your life or kill white.]

This is in a lot of ways the move that killed your top side.  You need to defend now or start running, because your Q-line stones are being undercut on both sides!]
;B[pj]TR[ne][og][oh]SQ[ob][pb][oc][pc][qg][rg]C[dave>
I don't think a pincer is appropriate.  You are near to being cut off in the corner and the proverb says that you can't defend territory that's open on two sides.  You have two white stones undercutting your black stones in the upper right, so you can give up on territory there, but the stones need a line of escape.  You could try to defend while giving a better base to run from (squares) or you could just run (triangles).]
;W[oh];B[oj]C[dave>
Again you are playing on the wrong side.  Don't worry about defending the bottom.  Your top right stones are dying!]

can i preserve this stone ? and build territories in this part of the board?



daveadams>>>>>>>
I think you need to defend your corner stones (squares) either by running our blocking.  O15 might be best to prevent white from using the wall at H.  Still you have to live or connect.  That should be your first priority.  Instead you are starting new lonely groups.]

;W[ge];B[fd];W[pc]C[dave>
This was the ultimate killer move.  If you had played Q17 you probably could have lived. But white got it first.]

This was a wasted move.  Those stones were already connected.  You should have been trying to save the J14 group which is being swallowed up...]

C[daveadams>>>>
I think that your stones around R16 may be lost no matter what, however, your play at R15 is bad shape.  The shape you should be looking for in this situation is S15, which gets you one eye immediately.  But like I say, it's really too late for those stones if white plays correctly.]
;W[rf];B[si];W[sh];B[oi]C[dave>
At this point the game is pretty much decided.  White probably could have made some territory in the lower right but you kept him out.  Still, you lost enough in the upper side to give him the win.

You did play well, though, in marking out the lower right.  There's not really much more to say.  Thanks for the submission and I hope you learned at least one or two things.  Please feel free to ask if you have any further questions.  dave@stuffeddog.com]
