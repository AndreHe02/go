C[Dear reviewer,

I (tom) played Black, it was an even game in our local club at Padua (Italy) without time limit and I played against a 6k.

I have added many comments, as is my habit when I go through my games shortly afterwards I have played them.
The comments give you in some occasions a hint why I made a certain move, but often just reflect my considerations during post-game analysis on my own.

In this particular game I think the game was reasonably good up to move 60, where Black made is first big blunder.

Later through the game Black and White made mutually some erros which ended in a win by 10 points (not considering komi) for White.

Any comments are highly appreciated.

Thanks a lot for your time and help!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]LB[pk:A]
C[tom: I plan to make the "chinese opening" with the next move at A.]
;W[qo]C[tom: White counters this strategy. Now I (Black) want to get out with sente from this corner to take the remaining corner ...]
;B[np]LB[jq:B][mq:A]C[tom: probably better at "A", since there is now a weakness White can aim at "B"]
;W[ql];B[dd];W[nc];B[qf]LB[pb:A][kc:C][qc:B]C[tom: I expect now the exchange White A, Black B, White C.]
;W[kc];B[fq];W[dn]LB[jp:A][iq:C][jq:B]TR[hq]SQ[kp]C[tom: now the problem is how to extend to work well with the marked stones on the right side? I considered A or B, but this leaves a weakness at the triangled point. Playing at C gives White the squared point to aim at later.]
;B[dr]LB[co:A]C[tom: Since I can not decide which point to play I  take some of the corner and settle my group. (Maybe not good since I remove any possible aji at "A")]
;W[cq];B[cj]LB[iq:A][jq:B]TR[cj]C[tom: a move off direction. I think now this must be at "A"  or "B". Black is greedy here.

Reviewer: Your are right. This must be "A"];W[fc]C[tom: White wants to avoid a "double wing formation" for Black here.]

(;B[hc]C[tom: I decide to invade and split up the white formation. Another maybe better possibility would be to defend the corner (see variation).]
;W[cc];B[cd]TR[cj]C[tom: I defend towards the triangled stone, expecting to gain more territory there.]
;W[dc];B[ed]LB[fb:A][ge:B]C[tom: I expect now the exchange A for B.]
;W[fd]C[tom: White does not want the exchange and pushes through...]
;B[ec];W[eb]
(;B[gb]C[Reviewer: Bad Move. Black should aim to cut F18 or D18.]
;W[fb];B[kd]TR[gb][hc]C[tom: this I thought would help my group of marked stones to get out of trouble when fighting starts on the left side.

Reviewer: This wouldn't be so bad move. But I think too tiny damge to be captured these marked stones.   I recommend move more urgent place.]

(;B[hq]LB[ir:A]C[tom: maybe better at "A" instead (see variation).

Reviewer: "A" looks ugly and inefficient.];W[jo];B[lq];W[cr]
C[Reviewer: This move isn't pretty good. L2, I guess.
Black can make things more easier.]

;B[hn];W[jm]
(;B[gd]LB[bc:1][hl:A]TR[ge][he][hf][hg]SQ[jm][jo][jp][jq]C[tom: Surely a big move, but gote. Black must play at "A" to keep the white stones marked with squares weak and under attack, it also helps the black group to get into the open. As long as White can't settle this weak group, Black can always capture the four white stones.
Before the actual move, Black should first play the forcing move 1 (see variation for better sequence).]
;W[bc];B[bd];W[ad];B[ae];W[ac];B[bf]C[tom: about 8 points in sente for white plus a living group :(]
;W[hl]C[tom: this hurts Black very much, as now his group comes under tremendous pressure - it also helps white considerably to get stronger.]
;B[cm]LB[gl:B][bm:C][fo:A]C[tom: Black should probably better play at A or B in order to try to settle his weak group. Black should probaly play at C if he wants to play in this area.]
;W[el];B[im]LB[fo:A]C[tom: maybe Black should try to make shape with A instead.]
;W[il];B[jn];W[kn];B[in];W[ln];B[ko]C[tom: wrong reading by Black. :(]

;W[lo];B[nm]LB[fo:A]C[tom: this was meant to menace the white marked group. Only that the marked black group should be looked after first with a move maybe at A.]

LB[pb:D][qi:C][dk:A][jk:B][rp:E]C[tom: a small endgame move by White. Now Black can make one of the big moves A to E. B attacks the marked white group and A expands territory on big scale, C and D expand territoy on smaller scale. E takes profit in the corner, but lets white expand to C. Probably the best move is B and then A? (see variation)]

(;B[nn]C[tom: wasted move (was meant to put pressure at the white center group ...]
;W[kl];B[jk];W[kk];B[lh]LB[hj:C][jj:A][ik:B]C[tom: Black must first continue at A, or White captures Black in a net (White A, Black B, White C)]
;W[mg];B[gh]C[tom: too small in scale  ... :(

;B[fn]LB[fi:B][fj:A]C[tom: Black must play at A urgently now, if not White at B will waste most of Blacks territory.]

(;B[mk]C[Review: This place wouldn't be urgent. I would understand that Black try to capture all of center white group.  Just, Chasing weak stone makes big advantage and benefit.  sometimes , it's bigger than capturing all of them.

Black should keep this white group weaker than black.];W[jj]
;B[ik];W[hj]LB[pb:B][qc:C][qi:D][fj:A]C[tom: Lets count assuming for simplicity Black A, White B, Black C and White D.
White:   upper left corner = 9 pts
              left lower side = 24 pts
              center = 8 pts

              upper right corner = 8+ pts

White: 9+24+8+18+8=67 pts

Black is ahead with some points! (of course till behind some points because of komi ;-)]
