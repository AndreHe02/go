RE[B+Resign]

C[I was 14? kyu on KGS at the time of my last rated game. KGS shows my rank rising to 11? kyu since then, based solely on improvements made by my earlier opponents. Ryan hasn't played rated games, so he has no official rank. We played this game on the Dragon Go Server to help us decide on a good handicap. In our current game on Dragon I gave him four stones and it's much closer than this one.

I wrote comments on my moves and already sent them to Ryan. I'm trying to help Ryan learn more about Go, so we'd appreciate your thoughts on how both of us played, as well as your thoughts on the comments I already wrote.

Thanks,

-Fred

Hi, I am David S. I will try and make some comments about this game, though I see it wasn't finished did Ryan resign?  Also, I question why you took Black if you are teaching Ryan?  In any event, my comments will be preceeded by "DS:"]
;B[qd]C[This move can be part of an enclosure that claims the corner and is hard to invade.]
;W[dp];B[pq]C[Again, hoping to make an enclosure and resist a 3-3 point invasion at R3.

DS:  Corner moves like this are much more than just preventing 3-3 invasions.  Each stone radiates power in several directions.  A stone at Q3 radiates influence toward the corner and along the bottom side.  It has less influence along the right side though, and less influence toward the center, especially when compared to a move at the 4-4 point  (D4) though it can be invaded at the 3-3.  This is not necessarily a weakness though.]
;W[dd];B[oc]C[Completing this enclosure puts me ahead in terms of secure territory, and this "wall" faces my stone in the opposite corner, making it a little harder for White to invade the right side of the board.

DS: Maybe ahead in secure territory, but not in influence.]
;W[dj]C[This completes White's "san-ren-sei", or "three star points in a row". It's a popular opening formation with many players, and it emphasizes influence on the center rather than claiming secure territory in the corners.

DS:  many would argue that W really should play at R10 or R9 now to break up B's potential on the R side.]
;B[pl]C[This moves tries to keep Black in balance with White, strengthen the lone Black stone at Q3, and also make an extension from the enclosure at the top. It is meant to discourage White from invading the right side, while keeping the territorial lead provided by the Black corner enclosure(s).

DS: I don't like this move.  I think it is close, but a move at R9 would be more balanced in regards to the top and bottom stones. Q8 seems awkward to me.]
;W[jc]C[DS:  Ok, but I think the bigger move is at the bottom.  Approaching the top right is not good as it is too solid. A move at K3 or N4 would have more potential in followups as they aim at invading at Q5 unless B responds.  No such luck at the top now.]
;B[ip]C[Keeping in balance with White, but trying to extend a little farther than White did at the top because Black has a relatively stronger corner position in the lower right.


DS:  B has a much larger moyo than W B is way ahead already.]
;W[mf]LB[cn:A][fq:B]C[DS:  Bad move. too loose.  the next moves should be reinforcing weak groups or invading.  Q10 or Q5  come into mind as other possibilties.  W is behind and needs to attack or reduce B to even things out.]

(;B[cn]C[This invasion turned out to be more dangerous and difficult than I expected.

DS: Coming from the wrong direction.  J4 is still relatively weak.  and this just induces W to extend toward it. A better move would be F3 which is both an extension from J4 and an attack on the corner.  

C6 is only an approach move, and in a very limited space.  See variations.]

(;W[dn]C[DS:  This is a common joseki.  But in this situation it is not the best. Just a move at F3 or C5 would be better options here.]
;B[dm]LB[en:A][co:B]C["When attached, consider the outside hane." -Go proverb. This seemed like a good way to fight back and try not to get isolated from the center.

DS: Natural responce.]
(;W[em]C[DS: NO!  W has really only two moves to consider here.  E6 and C5 See variations.]
;B[do]C[A bit aggressive. I tried to keep White separated and hoped to steal this corner.

DS:  One must punish his opponent for errors.];W[en]LB[co:B]
[eo:A]
(;B[eo]LB[cm:B][ep:A]C[Keep White separated, try to keep Black connected, and make sure Black is stronger than White near the corner. A White stone here instead would put me on the defensive.

DS:  I don't like this move.  B has too many cutting points. Just connect at C5 I think. W can capture these in a ladder otherwise.]

(;W[ep];B[cp]C[Reaching for the corner. "Corners are gold, sides are silver, and the center is grass" - Go proverb.

DS:  But the center is where the action is.];W[fo];B[co]C[Now the Black group has five liberties and is near the corner, while White has three groups with only three liberties each and two cutting points to defend.]
;W[fp]LB[fn:B][gn:A]C[White defends one cutting point and creates one group with a healthy six liberties.]

(;B[gn]C[Black threatens the other cutting point, but it's a bit of a false threat since both White sides could probably live if separated. I expected White to connect and allow me to make one more move in this area.

DS: This is a thankyou move.  W had to connect here somehow anyway.  This is a bad move.  Especially since B could just cut instead.]
;W[fn];B[im]C[This two-point-jump from J4 to J7 is now safer than if I played it before playing G6. It stakes out a big chunk of the lower part of the board for Black, and these three Black stones largely neutralize the influence of the white group.

DS:  Too loose.  B should make bigger move at either Q5, invade at C17 or extend from R16 to R12.]
;W[il]C[DS: Attaching like this only strenghtens your opponent.  Ok in close fighting for life and death, but bad here.  Remeber the go proverb " don' t touch what you want to attack".]
;B[jl]C["When attached, consider the outside hane."

DS:  Perhaps, but leads to unnecessary fighting. Just extend to K7 to further secure bottom territory.]
;W[jk]C[Another counter-hane by White (like move 14 at E7). This can be powerful, but it can also be tricky.]
;B[hl]C[This aggressive move tries to retain the initiative (sente) by forcing White to defend, strengthen the nearby Black stones, and possibly push farther into White territory later.

DS:  I think just cut at J9.];W[hk]C[DS: Bad move.];B[ik]C[I didn't expect White to make a ko, but I felt I needed to capture the White stone so White wouldn't play here instead and become much stronger than the weakly connected Black stones. The shape of these four Black stones is called a "ponnuki" (something like "empty point") and can be quite powerful.

DS: More or less. Depends on surrounding.  Here it is powerful.]
;W[ij]LB[kk:A][il:B]
(;B[kk]C[Trying to keep the initiative while securing the borders of the large Black framework in the lower right. If White retook the ko I'd have to solidify my connections, probably by playing at L8.

DS: You fight too much.  Just connect.  W has so many cutting points to exploit and B is thick (solid).]

(;W[jj];B[kj]C[Continue to solidify the borders since I have a bit of a lead and can still try to invade the upper left corner.]
;W[ji]C[DS: bad move. Empty triangle.];B[cc]C[This invasion seems bigger than anything else on the board at this point, and it retains initiative because I expected an immediate response from White either at C16 or D17.]
;W[ki]C[Turning a corner like this can be a big move, but the invasion in the upper left is more urgent. "Play urgent moves before big ones" -Go proverb.

DS:  Agreed. C17 demands a responce.];B[cd]C[With a two-move head start I hoped to take a large chunk of this corner and maybe snake out into the center.]
;W[cg]C[DS: white is just terrorized now.  Guessing.];B[de]
C[This hane from strong stones around a weaker stone puts the White stone in a ladder and threatens to push farther into White territory.

DS: Yes, powerful move.];W[ed];B[cq]C["A rich man shouldn't pick fights" -Go proverb. At this point I was fairly confident of my lead and wanted to secure some of my weaknesses. A White stone here instead would have forced me to struggle for eyespace while allowing White to secure more territory. If you didn't respond at D3 I could later play around E2 to claim more territory and possibly connect to my other stones. If you did respond at D3 I could take the initiative somewhere else.

DS:  Your stones at the top left are not secure yet. The cut at C15 remains.  A move at C14 first would be appropriate.]
;W[dq];B[pi]C[Another move that doesn't pick a fight. I wanted to secure territory on the side and strengthen the weak Black stones in the center. A White move in this area would have been quite big.

DS:  yes, but I think an enclosure move is way over due at C5 or R4.]
;W[nc];B[nd]C[Outside hane.

DS:  Bad habit of yours.  Just extend to P16. Solid then.];W[mc]
C[DS:  W lets B off lightly.];B[of]C[This move protects the cutting point at P16, partially closes the gap between O16 and Q11, and avoids starting a messy and unpredictable contact fight. This shape (P17-O16-P14) is quite strong and covers a large area.]
;W[li]C[Strong, and threatens to extend into Black's area and reduce it, but this move is a bit slow. A move at N11 would probably also be good.

DS: cutting at C15 would be better I think];B[mk]C[This move gives up some territory, but it avoids a contact fight. A direct response at M10 would have created an empty triangle (M10-K10-K9), which is considered a very poor, inefficient shape.

DS:  Too defensive.  B has no worries except lower R corner.  Again Q5, R5 or R4.]
;W[ni]C[DS: Missing the big moves elsewhere.  This hardly reduces B and does nothing to increase W's territory.  Just local fighting, forgeting the rest of the board.]
;B[ok]C[With P9-Q8-Q11 this creates the same shape we saw earlier. Still avoiding contact fights and securing borders.

DS: Ditto last comment.];W[ef]C[Nice move. I didn't realize until you played here that my invasion could be contained so well by only one more.

DS:  B had his chance.];B[eb]C[I needed to stake out enough eyespace first before doing anything around D15.]
;W[gb]C[DS:  No.  F17 at least.];B[df];W[dg]LB[ee:B][bf:A];B[bf]
C[This move accomplishes quite a few things. It defends the cutting point at C15, claims a bit of territory and potential eyespace, threatens to extend farther to B13, provokes White into responding at B13, and avoids making an empty triangle with D15-D14-C14.]
;W[bg]C[As I pointed out during the game, I was hoping you'd respond here. A White move at E15 would have contained Black better.

DS:  W should have connected at E15.];B[ee]C[This sets up the double atari.]
;W[fe]C[White had to block to avoid losing a lot of territory, but the diagonal line against stronger stones is a weakness.]
;B[ff]C[One atari...];W[eg];B[fd]C[Two ataris...];W[ge];B[fc]
C[And a nice capture.];W[hc];B[po]C[Finally completing my second corner enclosure so White can't invade around here and reduce my territory a lot. I chose Q5 instead of R5 because I was still worried about White invading around M3 and I wanted my "wall" to be closer to that area and stronger.

DS: Yes, but a little late.  A stronger opponent would have invaded here much earlier.]
;W[hp];B[iq]C[I considered the hane at H3, but this seemed stronger and better for fighting a White invasion around N3.]
;W[hq];B[ho]C["Hane at the head of two" -Go proverb. This means you should almost always play H5 when you see a shape like H3-H4 next to J3-J4 (or play J5 as White). In this case it's especially important because it also helps G6 and the other stones above.]
;W[dl];B[cm]C[The score estimator in my Go program says Black is winning by 67.5.

DS:  I assumed W resigned here.  However, W could harrass B's lower corner, but little chance to kill anything.  

PS>  Don't put too much faith in the score estimator. You should develop your own skills at counting.  Practice by watching others play and counting the score toward the end of the game and see how close you are.]
