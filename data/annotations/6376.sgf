;B[oq];W[pe];B[qi]LB[oc:b][nd:a]C[What are some standard ways to approach this black formation? this pincer seems ideal for black.

dv: The pincer may seem ideal but is actually lukewarm. It is too far a pincer to apply high pressure and too far an extension from the corner enclosure so that an invasion is still possible.

This pincer does not occur in any professional game at gobase. Which doesn't mean for us amateurs it be easy to refute.

My feeling is that pressing the black corner at A or B would be correct but i need to check with the opinion of stronger players. I've posted the question at http://senseis.xmp.net/?BQM395 You can follow it up with me there.

See variations.]
(;W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb]C[This is unreasonable.]
(;W[qg]C[With this variation White turns the pincer into an effective checking move (keeping white's extension in check). White is cramped.]
;B[nc]C[Low?

dv: it's a correct move with which Black restores his position.]
;W[ne]LB[og:a]C[It is difficult to find a good move for W now: either you add a stone and the position becomes a little overconcentrated or you leave it and it remains a bit weak.

But this move has little purpose: it has a high risk of ending up as a neutral point. A is better to strengthen the group (but as said it is perhaps overconcentrated).]
;B[qh]C[Is this a good or bad move?

dv: it is a strange move. It strengthens white and gets a little bit in return.]

(;W[rg]LB[mc:B][pg:A]C[Q13 instead?

dv: I always prefer a 4-th line move (A) over a 2nd-line move in the opening, but your move is possible.

On the other hand, you can wonder if this must be answered. You get a chance to give purpose to the previous move.]
;B[ld];W[ql]C[I understand the call for attack.];B[qn];W[ol]
C[This looks promising now for White];B[og];W[pg]LB[oi:a]C[Maybe attack at A.]
;B[oi]
(;W[ml]C[This is not urgent. These stones are light. Here it starts to go a little wrong for White. See variation.]
;B[of];W[oe];B[mh];W[md];B[mc];W[le];B[kd]C[All this leaning gives a lot of sure territory to Black, while the attack on the Black group is uncertain.]
;W[mj];B[pk]C[This is bad of course];W[pl];B[ph]LB[kh:a]C[Both previous move Black should simply jump to A.]
;W[rj]LB[lg:A]C[I prefer to surround at A first, instead of removing the base while threatening to connect underneath, but it may be preference.]
;B[rh];W[ke];B[mf];W[me];B[jd];W[ki];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh]
(;W[jf]C[You cannot back off here. See variation.];B[jh];W[mq]
;B[mo];W[lo];B[ln];W[lp];B[mn]TR[ke][jf][jg][lo][lp][mq]SQ[kg]
[jh][kh][ln][mo]MA[ki][ml]C[Two times you play an attachment with this effect. Black gets a full triangle, blighting the marked stone. If this is an unwanted effect, you should not play such attachment + retreat.

This is an example of calculating a little ahead and then evaluating the shape. I believe you played the attachment out of desire to enclose. But as we know, attachment rarely fulfills this purpose: it is rather an emergency measure or a leaning maneuvre.]
;W[jo];B[fq];W[hq];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr]
;W[eq];B[cn];W[fp]C[Too tight?

dv: Yes, absolutely. Already without the friendly stones around it is very tight. Now it is plain overconcentration.]
;B[fc]C[White is now seriously falling behind.

1) on territory: White only has the bottom against Black's top and three corners.
2) on strength: neither of White's two running groups are stabilized yet.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc];B[hd]C[So, White must look for chances to get back into the game.

- the top is absolutely unsiegable
- the bottom left is also sure territory
- there may be a small chance of attacking the middle right, but its nose sticking out with the full triangle it will be difficult

the bottom right looks like the only place where sth can be done.]

(;W[np]C[So you came to the same conclusion, but I'm thinking of sth like the var.]
;B[on];W[kn];B[hg];W[hf];B[gf];W[ig];B[ih];W[gg];B[hh];W[ge]
;B[ie];W[if];B[gh];W[ff];B[ch];W[ck]LB[cl:a][bo:b]C[The correct point to pressure the corner is A, because it aims at B.]
;B[cb]C[Black is biting off every bit of territory you have, challenging White to attack the middle group. It looks too strong indeed to attack.]

;W[hk];B[kl]MA[fi][gj][ij][jj][lj][mk][cl][dm][lm][fr][nr][fs]
[ns]C[reasonable?

dv: Well, it uses the weakness of the white group to strengthen the black group, so yes, reasonable. White must now fight very hard to attack the group effectively but I do not see how it can be killed.

If White can play so as to take the marked territory however, then there are still chances.]
;W[lm];B[km];W[jk]LB[kj:a]C[perhaps better at A];B[lj];W[lk]

LB[qg:A]TR[md][ee][fe][ge][ke][le][me][ne][oe][gf][hf][if][jf]
[gg][ig][jg]C[With this exchange all Black weaknesses have disappeared and White has lost his chances, for the territorial lead is too large.

Conclusion: 
- you got off a bad start with the cramped extension at A, leaving your group weaker than should (see variations at that point)
- the whole leaning against the top to attack black's central group ended up futile
- giving Black strong shapes as the full triangles should be avoided under most fighting circumstances]
