C[Hi,

My name is Johanna Tuominen, I'm EGF 1 dan. I added some comments during the game and to ypur questions. Hope they help. Enjoy the game of Go.



Dear reviewer,
As I now see this game after reviewing it, I know the sheer number of mistakes in the middle and end game, by both players, make the neither easy nor very interesting to study.

That is why I would like to focus more about the fuseki : which moves, which josekis should I have chosen ?

I feel I have been thinking a lot too locally throughout this game, do you have some general advice to give about my game, or how I should work in order to step it up?

Thanks a lot !

By the way, I played white. And my questions are marked Astralth :]

C[Astralth : I tend to use this pincer a lot in my latest games, in which situations is it interesting?

JT: I think in this situation it is ok. I like more the tight pincer played in M3 and the josekis starting from there but if you are more familiar with this it's ok. There are atleast four josekis for black from this point. I put some variations.

I don't like the black next move to B. The joseki book says that the variation from B is good only if you are trying to reduce moyo, and therefore I think it is too slow.]
(;B[no]
(;W[qn]LB[pn:A]C[JT: Joseki move is A.];B[pr];W[qq]
(;B[lr]LB[fc:A][gp:C][fq:B]TR[no][nq][pr]C[JT: I think the biggest point in the board is to play at A. It is a correct direction of play from the hoshi stone Q16. The marked blakc stones are alive but small so it is not an urgent matter. 

The white stone in L4 is problematic because if you try to approach, for instance to B or to C like happened in the game black can just play pincer.]
(;W[gp]C[Astralth : Now my position feels too high ... 
JT: Yeps, and the blcks next move is annoying... for white]
;B[iq];W[kr]C[JT: Does not work because of the marked stone.]

(;W[df]LB[fc:A][cn:B]C[Astralth : Is this good direction of play ?
Maybe I could make a better use of the wall in lower right corner?

JT: See the variation from previous node. I think first A then B if white gets sente.]
;B[cj]C[Astralth : I have trouble adding a second move after my approach is somewhat treated lightly, please give me some clues.
JT: The double approach you played is ok.];W[fc];B[fd]

;W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[de]LB[mc:A][qg:C][cn:B]C[Astralth : Now my D14 stone feels lonely, and after this starts my local thinking.
My questions end here, however, please feel free to add comments where you think it may help me get better.
Thanks again for your time !

JT: You should not worry about the D14 stone. Leave it there and play somewhere else like A, B or C. 
It might give you aji later and if it worries you opponent then he can use extra stone to defend but other than that it is useless at this moment of the game.]
