C[[STP\] Hello Daitenshi
I'll make my coments starting with [STP\]. should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email on 1stephan_dattner@noos.fr
Best regards, Stephan];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[dj]C[Here i wanted to be able to make a base in up there or downthere (it depend where my opponent go) but i realise that i should play on the C lane to make the classical base so i think it is bad

[STP\] I am not sure I like this move. The main reason would not be because it is on the 4th line but because basically you give the lead (the sente) to White (as you said by the way).
On move 6, he will choose the direction, you will have to follow.
There is also a rule: start to play on the corner, then continue to play on the sides, then on the centre.
From a startpoint, to play on the 4th or on the 3rd lines are both good moves. I think it is more a question of whether you want to play more the influence on the center or more building moyo on the sides.]

SQ[aj][bj][cj][ak][bk][ck][al][bl][am][bm][cm][an][bn]C[I realised that i ve done a mistake to make a base so i play here to attack the coin and force him to defend it like that i can enhance the 5th stone and make my base

[STP\] This is fairly dangerous and not joseki at all. C8 and D8 are weaknesses that will force Black to play an additional move... And then loose one move while White is building something elsewhere.

If you now look what had been achieved from a moyo standpoint at this stage, White is already ahead]

[bo][ap][bp]C[Here we play one of the joseki i know. I think it is good for me because now i think my base is almost alive

[STP\] The stones I markes are joseki' stones, you are right... but not the stone on D10.
Black is overconcentrated now, White is ahead and still have the sente]
;W[jp]
(;B[lp]CR[dh]C[[STP\] I am not sure I like very much those moves on the 4th line. Although you are building moyo the base are weak and you can be easily invaded.
As far as I would be concerned I would have played both stones (D12 and M4) on the 3rd lines]
;W[jn]
(;B[fn]C[I choose to ignore my opponent and put a stone which enhance my base and threat a bit his corner

[STP\] Remember the rule: 1-corner, 2-sides, 3-centre.
Here you are playing in the center much too early (as well as White by the way)]
;W[ln];B[hq]CR[lp]SQ[bq]C[At this point i choose to coniune to ignore my opponent moves because even if start to become dangerous for my right bottom corner i think that with one more free move i can take his left bottom corner. And so i think it is worth for me because it will make his 3 others stone really weak.

[STP\] It is a good idea... Although much too early in the game as I said earlier.
Then before launching an attack, usually it is better to consolidate the base. You are right H3 is a tentative to cut both White groups but both marked stones are very weak as well.
Another consideration is to aknowledge that the leftt White group is aready almost alive. A move on B3 is enough to settle it]
;W[ho]
(;B[dr]SQ[hq]C[I have seen this move in a post joseki lesson and i try to copy it but i am not sur if i have done it well and if it was a good idea.

[STP\] I think the problem is that the stone on H3 is too weak to support the stone on D2]

(;B[qg]C[[STP\] it may not be the right direction:];W[ql]
(;B[qq]SQ[lp]C[[STP\] I think because of M4, black could have played Q2, Q3 or even P3]
;W[ol];B[jd];W[ic];B[de]SQ[ce]C[[STP\] good move but  again you lack solid basis. C15 might have been better]

(;W[ci]SQ[cg]C[[STP\] White mistake, he should have played C3]
;B[cg]C[And at this point my oppent just disconnected from the game... So i dont know if i can be sure of the result of this game and if he "resign" or got internet trouble but anyway ithink at this point of the game i can got south west corner and west side, a little part of south east corner maybe. And i think my opponent got north west corner and a lillte base on east side that can be link with the south side.

[STP\] It is too early to determine who is leading the game. White 44 is a big mistake for White which leaves Black with a strong influence in the middle. North East is not settled at all.]

You make a moyo on the corner and you weaken White moyo at the same time.]
