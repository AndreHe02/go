C[I leave a few comments throughout the review.  Basically, this was a pretty evenly played game and we both are just looking for plays that might have been a little sharper to tip it in one direction or the other.  Thank you!

J: Hi my name is Jay, and I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments start with "J:"]

;W[gg];B[gh]C[After the game we discussed the possibility that W cut here (variation).  He said that in the end he opted for the simpler route and knew it would be sente at least.

J: F12 for black here is normal. More comments in variation.]

(;B[dl]C[How would you respond to the approach here?  We discussed after the game that this may be wasting the strength of B on the side.



Unfortunately I had to leave, so this was the last move we discussed together.

J: you're correct, it would be better to push this with stone against black's strength.  See variations.]

;W[pg];B[qh];W[ph];B[rf];W[qe];B[qi];W[qc];B[pc]MA[kc]C[J: I would rather see L17 for black here instead for it gives a larger base.]
;W[re];B[pl]C[J: the low extension at r8 is better here because it mildly aims at the corner.  It also prevents a white move at r6 later.]
;W[kg]MA[lc]C[J: L13 is too soft.  Not sure what it accomplishes. M17 would be a good way to start an attack.]
;B[kc];W[qn];B[qm]
(;W[jp]C[J: K4 is an overplay. It's too close to black's walland doesn't work well with any other stones.  Q6 might be enough.  See variation.]
;B[pn]
(;W[qo]C[J: Q5 for white instead works better with k4.];B[op]

(;W[go]C[J: white has no choice but to push along the bottom now.  See variation.]
;B[gn];W[ho];B[fo];W[il];B[nq]C[The purpose of this move was to make it possible to attack the H5 group later.

J: Black's O3 is painful for white.];W[or];B[po];W[qq];B[hc]
C[I felt this was potentially bigger than attacking, but now I think perhaps it was a poor choice.  W's next play is in the area I had been considering.

J: attacking j8 group should be black's priority right now.]

;W[jo];B[hl]C[J: K8 cut for black is playing at a bigger scale.]
;W[gk]C[J: G8 is not important, J9 would help the K7 group more.]
;B[ik];W[jl];B[hk];W[gi];B[ke]C[J: L15 is very small, worth about 3 points.  H12 is important for attack.]

;W[cc];B[be];W[bc];B[pf]C[J: Q14 is a very sharp cut.  White has to be careful because after the G14 cut, L13 may not live.]

C[In the end I feel it was perhaps the play on the left side that lost it for B, either in choosing a poor response to the approach or in allowing W to play first in that area after blocking the connection underneath at O3.  We are both curious to hear the thoughts of a stronger.  Thank you in advance for the review!

J: Not thatit matters, but black's H14 is still a point.

While it's true that the B11 area became too overconcentrated in the end, black's outside influence was very impressive for the small corner white gained.  I think the the loss happen when black didn't utilize his influence for attacking.

The takeaway from this game should be to learn to capitalize on strength for attacking, and to not play small points such as L15.  Thanks for showing me this game.]
