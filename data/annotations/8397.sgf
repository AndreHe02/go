C[Hey my name is Jake and i was playing black in this game. I only lost by .5 but i felt there were a few points i could have done better at. I would like to know what i could do to improve my game overall. Thnx for looking at my game.]

i felt like the next few moves around here were a little strange for some reason.]
(;B[kp]C[White J3 is the almost sente reponse to this.]

;W[eh];B[ei];W[cg]C[here is where you pay for playing D11 out too far; white has this cutting sequence.]
;B[ch];W[bg];B[bh];W[dh];B[ci];W[ff];B[gg]C[don't play bad shape unless you must.  First look up empty triangles, and then ask whether this move did much for you.]

[js][ks][ls][ms][ns]C[You had a won game from the middle game onward, right until the last moves.  I suspect you were under time pressure, but sometimes just defending everytime to be safe is not the way to go.  If the game is close and you don't have time to read, be daring and avoid playing moves like P11.  You might lose due to some terrible tesuji, but if playing them loses you the game anyways, you might as well bet (in a close game) that there is no tesuji.

Practice the end game.  I suspect it would help out with some or even all of the earlier problems I noted.


Thnx for looking at my game i appreciate it. :)])
