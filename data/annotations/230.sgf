KM[5.5];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc]M[po]C[I'd  normally expect W to prevent a B shimari by playing at or near
the marked point. For example :-]
(;W[np]C[Not a move I know. Looks like the  sort of move W would play
if B had played a chines fuseki, and had a stone around S9.];B[fq]C[I think B  should answer, this approach feels non-urgent to me.]
;W[pp]C[The right sort  of idea. W could just play R5 instead. We then
get into the realms of the taisha (it's like W had played R5,
B had approached at Q3 and W had pressed at O4. But anything that
gets W some thickness is going to be fine. Key question is who
gets to extend along the side first, R10 is going to be a big point.];B
[qp];W[qo];B[qq]C[Highly tactical stuff. I've no real idea what else you both  might
have played. So far so good. Both sides are getting what they're
entitled to.]
(;W[op]C[The shape feels wrong, but the idea is fine for W.];B[dn]C[I feel that S5 is too big for B to leave.]
;W[eo];B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[co];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[do];W[en];B[dm]

(;W[ro]C[Big move, but W's  left corner group has bad shape. I think  the "proper" thing to do is to add say F4.]
;B[fp]
(;W[ep];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rp]C[A bit of a grovel for B. Especially having to leave O2 behind,  but
being sure you're alive helps. W now has huge thickness but is lumbered
with a dango on the left. The trick now for W is find a way to look  after that group.]

(;W[iq];B[pj]C[Very big.];W[pf]C[Premature. K16 looks best to  me. I know that if you have  thickness
then you should use it to attack, but B Q10 is going to be hard work to  attack.]
;B[qm]
(;W[pd]C[Pushing into a knight's move - usually bad.  Contact play
usually an attempt to settle. But here just running away
is enough?];B[pc];W[qe]C[At this point B seems OK, yet in subsequent moves it  all goes
horribly wrong. I've been trying to identify *where*. I think
that the real answer is that W is "entitled" to erase the territory,
see my earlier variation. So B mustn't over-reach and try to  inflict too much damage on W. He especially needs to make sure that
he gets a chance to look after his little group on the right side.];B[od]
C[But this does seem natural. Obviously if W connects then
B is happy.];W[rd]C[So this is a reasonable idea.]
(;B[pe];W[qc];B[qf]C[B has  committed to finding a pretty big ko threat.]
;W[pd]M[pn]C[Where's the ko threat?  The problem is that W has lots of threats
to kill the bottom right. I can see only the marked point that W
might answer.];B[fr]C[Looks menacing, but even if it works W can  afford to let the  dango go!]
;W[oe]C[A real problem. If B doesn't follow up th ko threat he  feels
awful, but W's move is pretty much sente. Looks like B couldn't
afford the ko - did B evaluate the ko threat situation before
starting the ko?]
(;B[es]C[Too small, the W stones are far from extinguised.  E7 is probably best,
admittedly, B will probably end up in gote but E7 gets power across the
board.];W[em]C[I'm not sure whether W should bother with this exchange yet.  He's
rather committing to keeping the stones. Still it's pretty much sente.]
;B[dl];W[lc]L[el][gn][cf]C[Good move. B needs to decide what he wants. I'd be inclined to
play a (surely W will treat this as sente?) And then c.];B[md];W[ld]C[B sets up a target for attack here, and his right side group is
less stable now that W is stong above and below, also W is building
along the top.];B[ne];W[nf]C[
 Mars 15k*: Starting observation.];B[mf];W[le];B[ng];W[of];B[pg]C[So near ...   It's the shape move but ...]
;W[qg]C[Mistake by W, he must cut at N15, this  unifies W and removes all
B threats.]
(;B[rf]C[Nice if it works, but the cut at N15 destroys this idea];W[og]
C[N15 is still v big];B[ph]C[White seems to be forcing B to patch up  right side.]
;W[oh];B[oi];W[me];B[nd];W[mg];B[nh];W[lf];B[mc]
(;W[pb];B[lb];W[kb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nb];W[la];B[ma];W[mb];B[df]C[Flower viewing time for white. B  should probably ignore
the ko for now, it's of little strategic importance; W is
alive all around it. So B needs two moves to gain 20 points.
The board is full of larger moves.];W[cf];B[cg];W[ce];B[lb];W[ka];B[oa]
;W[dg]C[B can't afford this. Nice move by W.];B[dh];W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B
[mb]C[In  the heat of the game it's hard to know what to do. I think
that B needs to leave that ko alone. W now has sente and ought
to be able to wrap the game up. F12 looks huge to me, and in
the game it's what I would have played, almost without thinking.
However B13 seems to turn out to be big so ...]
(;W[fh];B[ek]
(;W[gm];B[bg]C[Suddenly things are less clearcut. The problem is that W can't  easily make territiory at the bottom *and* look after his dango,
and B13 threatens the corner.];W[qh]L[bf][ho]C[Again this is natural, but it loses  sente. a is very big
and probably sente. Ensuring the safety of the dango at b is also
good.];B[pi];W[rg];B[qi];W[sf];B[eb]

[de]C[Don't have time for this.];B[io]C[
B has managed to build enough thickness to contemplate
attacking the dango, and on a large scale.];W[gi];B[fj];W[hn];B[ho];W[hl]
;B[im];W[go];B[fo];W[il];B[in];W[jp]C[W needs to connect his dango, there's no  time for this. P2 is

just yet.];B[hj]C[Looks like a really good point.];W[jl];B[ih];W[lh];B[kj]

certainly won't do so in sente. Is the above shape alive?

still has sente.]))

answer, so we get ...];B[ch];W[bg];B[bi]C[If we get this result then W's  corner is much stronger, and
W still has sente. If B refuses to yield sente then life gets
complicated, but I think still playable for W.]))

later.]))

is bigger, so if B gets the timing right this is good by B.]))
