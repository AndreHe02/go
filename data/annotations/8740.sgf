C[aimaime17 [10k\]: hi
Megajohn [12k\]: Hi gg
Megajohn [12k\]: In this game I was trying to be more agressive because I generally play too safe and cautious. Thank you for reviewing and taking the time to help!
NK: Thanks for letting me! :-) Please take warning, though, I am not that much stronger than you, about 8k I'd say. So a stronger player might well disagree with what I say. Anyway, I hope I can give some useful ideas.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[qj]C[NK: Not a very agressive opening, the low chinese. :-) But there is nothing wrong with it.]
;W[cj];B[fc];W[hd];B[fe]
(;W[df];B[gg];W[kd]C[NK: Some points about being agressive.
Here white is asking for it. I'd play n17. Then you are taking away his base and he will have to go for the centre. Follow that variation.]

(;B[eb]C[NK: e17 leaves less weak points];W[nc]C[NK: Now whites group seems quite safe]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[jp]TR[cj]C[When your opponent has a corner star point with both wings (the marked stones) it is usually considered a good time to make an invasion at the 3-3 point.]
(;B[fq];W[dn]C[Megajohn [12k\]: I wasn't sure of the best way to make an invasion/reduction since he was already on the middle star point.
NK: Go back two moves for my answer.];B[hq]TR[fq]C[NK: here you can see the drawbacks of this tactic. The marked stones are too thight, but I understand why you hesitated to play j3 which is very close to k4.]
;W[nq]C[Megajohn [12k\]: hmmm...
NK: Here, or... (continue)];B[oq];W[np];B[pn];W[ej]C[NK: ...even here, I'd slide in under k4. (see variation)]
(;B[lp]C[NK: However, this is also aggressive and turns out well in the end. It seems fine to me because of you stones to the right and left. Never mind the variations.]

(;B[ho]TR[ip][jp][jq]C[Megajohn [12k\]: I realized after this was a passing move but I wasn't reading enough to be confident of it during the game.
NK: Do you mean passive? If you wanted to be sure of catching the marked group you could have made a move that did something else at the same time, like the peek at e5 (see variation).]
;W[nl];B[mo]C[This is good, semi-aggressive play I think. Not flawless of course, but if we follow the game up to move 64 you are pressing white, chasing him inte the center while taking the edge and securing your group in the middle.]

;W[pl];B[rn];W[pj];B[qi];W[pi];B[ph];W[nh]C[Not until this move can white feel confident to get two eyes, but he has gained very few points.]
;B[nf]C[From this move on I think both of you are going at it the wrong way. You are trying to separate him and he is trying to connect. Why? Both his groups will live anyway.
And there are really no points to gain in the centre. The sides and corners are far more important at this stage. (This is, by the way, a mistake that I make all the time.)]

Megajohn [12k\]: I think you were winning...
Megajohn [12k\]: Thank you for reviewing this game! I stretched myself an won but it was a challenge. What do you think I should set my focus on based off this game? tesuji? L&D? Making Good Shape? Attack & Defense?

NK: Well, I'd have to be boring and say the end game. I am not too good at it either and I'm a bit too lazy to study it hard. Up to move 65 I'm quite happy with your game, but then you should have left the center alone and tried to make sente moves at the edges and corners. You kept your lead, but if white had played a better he might well have won. 

I don't think you were too aggressive by any means.

On second thought, making good shape might be something for you to work on.

Hope this helps somewhat. It was fun to do, anyway.

Best regards,
