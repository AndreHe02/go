;B[dd]C[I'm white.  Komi 0.5  IGS network.  I'm about 27K on IGS.  I know they grade higher so I talked to a 1dan once and he thought I was 16K.  I honestly don't know.

Hi, I'm David
My comments will be designated by "DS:" Ok?

I hope they help.  I'm about 7k on IGS, but that is variable. ;)  I doubt I'm strong enough to gauge your strenght though.]
;W[kd];B[dj]C[I'm also interested in black's moves.  If he makes a mistake along the way, please tell me how I should have acted against it.]
;W[jk]C[I don't really know how to play these 3/4 openings yet, I just have fun experimenting with them.  Please tell me if I used them effectively.]
;B[jc]C[DS: Bad move by B.  J10 is better as it is an extension from D10 as well as an attack against the corner.]

(;W[kc]C[DS: Wrong direction.  K10 the only move. PRLV (Please Review Last Variation)]
N[real progress];B[jd];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj];B[fi]
(;W[kg]C[DS: W really should continue in the lower left corner with E3 or D3.  PRLV...]
N[real progress];B[jg];W[jf]C[DS: I'm not sure about this one, but I think I would have played K6 instead]
;B[gi]C[DS: B really should play J7 or even cut at L8, but L8 creates complicated variations.]
;W[hf]C[DS: Bad move.  When B plays G5 you should at least play H4. A one point jump seems too loose right now.  Perhaps J8 would be playable though.]
;B[kf]
(;W[ke]C[DS: the rule is, 'when caught in a cross-cut, extend.'   It seems perhaps that K9 might be better. PRLV]
N[Real progress];B[lf];W[lg]C[DS: Correct.];B[jh];W[gc]C[DS: ok.  I might have preferred to play F11, but G11 works better with the potential cut at J10.]
;B[if];W[je];B[ie]
(;W[jb]C[DS: Bad move.  W should just cut at J10. PRLV...]N[Real progress]
;B[hd];W[ic]C[DS: not the best, but it works. I would have preferred H11.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[gd];W[ec]C[What would have been the best move at this point.  Even though it worked out okay, I have a feeling this might not have been it.

DS: C11 possible, but I think it is more important to stabilize the stones at the bottom.  H4 or possibly G3 would be better. Then W wouldn't have any weak groups to worry about.]
;B[fd];W[cb];B[fc];W[fb];B[dc];W[db];B[cc];W[ck]C[DS: Ok, looks playable now. but G4 is still in grave danger.]
;B[cj];W[dk];B[hj];W[hk]
(;B[ik]C[DS: bad move, B should just capture. W then would be in deep trouble. PRLV...]
N[Real progress.];W[ij]C[DS: Bad move.];B[gk];W[il]C[This exchange here...  I feel it may have been a bit sloppy.  But I don't know...

DS: Yes, both W and B missed important moves here.];B[kj]C[DS: bad move.  B should just descend to G2, and capture the corner stones of D3 etc.]
;W[kk]C[DS: Seems W really should play G2 instead.];B[gl]C[DS: B gets the bigger point.]
;W[ki]C[DS: Nonsense move. W should at least try to save the stones at C3.  Perhaps C4 would be ok now.]
;B[ji];W[jj];B[lj];W[li];B[lk]
(;W[mf]C[DS: Just M2.  B can do nothing here.]N[Real progress]
;B[kl];W[hi]C[DS: Bad atari.  K2 almost mandatory.];B[hh];W[gj]
;B[hg]C[DS: Bad move. B could have just played J5 then D3 to capture F3.]
;W[fl]C[DS: Good move.];B[hj];W[ii]C[DS: well, I think this is not much of a ko threat.  Perhaps K2 better here.]
;B[gj];W[gm]C[Whoo-hoo!  I connected...  I think...  Is there a way to stop this connection?  Black didn't stop it...

DS: Just H1 breaks the connection. PRLV...]
(;B[hl]N[real progress.];W[hm]C[DS: B missed his chance to win the game.]
;B[jl];W[ik]C[DS: correct];B[lm];W[ml];B[ll]C[DS: no.  If B plays K1 then he can live by threatening to play J1.]
;W[jm];B[ih];W[im];B[km];W[fm];B[ek];W[el];B[dl]C[DS: messy, doesn't really work.]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[ak]C[DS: this move makes no sense. W should just play B4. B will have no good response.]
;W[mj];B[bk];W[bc]C[This was the right move, right?  Was there a better yose or something?

DS: I agree, this seems to be the best move at this time.];B[bd]
;W[ac]C[I'm always confused here...  Do the points work in my favor if I go at B12?  or is it the same effect?  Is B12 a better shape?  Does it give the same amount of points?

DS: W at B12 leaves the potential to play A10 in sente later, but at this stage there is little else to do. So if W B 12, then B will play A11 first. So  I think you played ok here.]
;B[ad];W[ba];B[ed];W[eb];B[kh];W[lh];B[gf]C[Not necesary right?  I couldn't have done anything I think...

DS: Correct.  This was unecessary.  Just giving points to W.]
;W[bl];B[al]
(;W[mk]N[Real progress.]C[E3 would have been better maybe..  I think I wasted 2 moku...

DS: no, if you don't play here, B could capture the entire group. Since W was way ahead by now, there was no need to take chances.]
;B[ek];W[em];B[ej];W[mm];B[bj]C[I won by 16.5

B Captured 3
W Captured 13 + (0.5 komi)

DS:  You show some reading skill, but would benefit from reading two books.  "the Direction of Play" which explores the direction that stones want to extend toward.  And the book "Lessons in the Fundamentals of GO"  Both are really great at filling in some of the gaps you have.  Also, work through BASIC life and death problems until you can play them almost without thinking. Then the more difficult ones will become easier too.]
