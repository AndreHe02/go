AB[dp][pd]C[Hi!  I played this game on KGS with a two-stone handicap.  I am Black.

Please do the review for both sides - we had interesting discussion after the game, but I neglected to save our review.  I will try to remember as much as possible.

Thanks!

Kyle

(;B[op]C[I played this move, planning on playing the avalanche if White played P3, but now I think I should have played Q10 or another move on the side to play on a bigger scale.

Az: The avalanche doesn't make sense if W has a stone at L3, the normal would continuation is shown in the variation. As for what is best, it depends on what kind of game you want to play. If you are going to take a star point, I would prefere K16 over Q10, though either is probably playable.]

(;W[nc]C[Az: I think W should answer in the LR corner to attack your weak stone, tenuki seems an inconsistent strategy for white.]

(;B[qo]TR[kq]C[I wanted to see what White would do in response in order to consider how to respond to O17 - maybe taking the corner is better.

Az: Playing this way your influence is limited by the marked stone. I would prefere to take the corner, after which white has two weak groups (see var)]
;W[ro];B[po];W[rn];B[qq];W[rp];B[pp]LB[pq:A]C[Should be at A

Az: Yup];W[rq];B[pr]
(;W[qk]LB[pm:A]C[W atari first, then play R9?

Az: Yes :) Moves like R2 are very important forcing moves, even if you leave them. After the atari W can play R9 or 'a'. Either way the result is really bad for black.]
;B[qf]
(;W[mq]C[Az: W must atari first];B[rr]C[I was happy with this - B still has Q11 with R8 as a big followup]
;W[fc];B[jc]LB[jd:A]C[Az: For a handicap game I think 'a' might be better since it is significantly harder for W to counter attack against the higher pincer. For an even game this is fine.]
;W[df];B[ee]LB[fd:A]C[Az: A strange move, this is usually bad for black once W takes the corner. I can understand reluctance to play 'a', but it is still probably better]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[gd]C[I made a mistake here - should be C18

Az: C18 is a must, but even then the result looks promising for white.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec];W[ef];B[iq]LB[pb:A]C[Is this too early?

Az: I think so, 'a' looks big since not only does it take profit but it threatens to take enough profit in this part of the board that W can't ignore it for long.]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[fo]TR[dr][cq]C[Az: Dubious exchange for W, he looses the option of invading the corner later without gaining much eyespace.]
;B[io];W[ln];B[im];W[fm]
(;B[qi]C[Both my opponent and I agreed it should be on the left side, to attack the W stones

Az: D9 is the right shape, allowing W to get around you with C8 is nearly always bad.]
;W[cl]C[This hurt a lot.];B[en]C[I was trying to resist actively, but I endeed up strengthening my opponent too much...?]
;W[fn]C[I was trying to resist actively, but I endeed up strengthening my opponent too much...?

Az: Getting sealed in is not an option, so do what you have to do to get out here even if it is an early Christmas for white.]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[el];W[hn];B[in];W[gk]TR[cl]C[Now my stones look heavy.

Az: True. The root of the problem was letting W play the marked stone earlier.]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[ej];W[ci];B[ll]C[I was happy to get this point.]
;W[oq];B[nq]C[Asking move

Az: Only move];W[np];B[nr];W[no];B[pm]LB[qm:A][rm:B][nm:C]C[Az: This is a bit passive, not enough threat to the group on the right. I think B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' is better. see var]
;W[mr]C[I did not have time to read out the variation of killing White on the right -he could probably get out, so I went ahead and responded here.]

(;B[or]C[Too soft - killing the stones on the right works

Az: Nope, see variation];W[qm];B[lp]LB[pl:A]C[Should have taken A first?

Az: Yes];W[nm]LB[pl:A]C[Az: 'a' is still the biggest move for you]
;B[kp];W[jq];B[jp];W[pl]C[Az: Now the situation is very easy for white. Even if he gives up a stone or two he isn't in much danger.]
;B[mp];W[ir];B[lq];W[lr];B[hr];W[jr]LB[hq:A]C[Az: Mistake, should atari at 'a' first]
;B[hp];W[ks]TR[np][no][ln][nm]C[Now W is alive everywhere, and B cannot attack White's cutting stones.  How did this happen?]
;B[pb];W[hd]C[Good move];B[gc]C[I was in sudden death, and thought that W could use Black's response at H17 to create a group on the side, which I did not want, but it turns out it is harder than I expected.

Az: I don't see anything wrong with H17];W[ge];B[fe];W[he];B[ff]
;W[eh];B[cr]C[This may not have been necessary, but I am not taking any chances.  It is big regardless

Az: This is probably forced after W's last move. Your group is in a lot of danger.]
;W[hc]C[Unfortunately, I had to give this point up, which is big]
;B[fd];W[hb]C[White misread here];B[lc];W[ne];B[ke]C[W in trouble, but Black screws up later]
;W[kb];B[jb];W[lb]
(;B[mb]LB[kc:A][kg:B]C[Almost the losing move - should be at A?

Az: Absolutely. After you jump to 'B' the result will be good for you no matter which side W plays on]
;W[mc];B[nb];W[kc];B[ld];W[kd];B[le];W[jd];B[ji]C[Az: I like this move]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[hi]LB[oi:A][ol:B]C[Az: How about 'a' next? It is hard to disconnect W if he ignores a further move around J12, so it is probably no longer sente to play there. 'a' aims to capture the stones on the top on a large scale, as well as preparing the cut at 'b']

(;B[hh]C[Unnecessary now, maybe better to just take points.]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[nh]
(;B[oi]C[I think I played too fast and should have played to protect the center stones first, then cut.

Az: You must defend your group first, unfortunately it is not easy to defend and capture W at the same time]
;W[kg];B[lg]
(;W[lh]C[Az: W has some forcing moves to make first];B[nf];W[of]
;B[mf]
(;W[oh]C[Big mistake, should be P15.

Az: Actually, Q15 is better...];B[oe];W[mk];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh]

(;B[li]C[Az: Small...];W[mh];B[kj];W[pi];B[ph];W[pj];B[pg]C[Black looks ahead at the start of the endgame, but not by much.  I am glad to cut off four stones at the top at least, but I think my middle game wasn't so good.  N18 and G17 may be to blame...  No more comments

Az: A few endgame mistakes, but I think I'll stop here as well.]
