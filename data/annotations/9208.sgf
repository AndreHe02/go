C[S.

Hello, my name is Simon. Thank you very much for reviewing my game.

This is a free game that I played against an unraked opponent. I believe that this player was much stronger than me and I feel that he was outplaying me since the start.

I normally review my games myself but I feel that this one is worth reviewing by a stronger player because I feel I have made a lot of mistakes which I cannot see as clearly as a stronger player can.

CB> Ok, we'll see that.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj]C[S.

The reason why I am playing free games is so that I can experiment without it affecting my ranking.

I wanted to gain some experience using sanrensei.

Any points over how to use it would be greatly appreciated. :)]
;W[di]C[S.

White plays the High Chinese opening.

I hear that the best way to counter a chinese opening is to over concentrate the opponent.

Any thoughts?

CB> That's a strategy, yes, but among others. the main idea is to use one's own influence, or to counter the opponent's influence.]
;B[fp]C[S.

I figured that this high stone would help to over conentrate him and It would coordinate well with my sanrensei

However I feel right now that I am very influence based, is this okay?

CB> Playing high makes sense.];W[hq]
(;B[hp]C[CB> Against this low pincer, we usually play high on the other side, see var.]
;W[gq];B[gp]C[CB> You let white connect his stones. You should split him.]
;W[fq];B[iq]C[S.

Hit the head of three];W[ir];B[jq];W[jr]C[S.

Here I considered playing a tenuki but I figured it would be best to play safe and add an extra stone.

CB> you are right, otherwise you leave a bad shape. But you played the wrong move, see var.]

(;B[kq]C[CB> your move leaves the cut at J4, but as long as white doesn't push it's ok]
;W[kr]C[CB> this move is sente]
(;B[de]C[S.

Attempt to reduce, I expect a pincer which I will run/jump away from

CB> The pincer is already here with D11.]
(;W[lq]C[CB> you called for it... you cannot avoid white breaking through.]
;B[lp];W[mp]C[S.

This appeared very odd to me, it is not every day that I see a tripple hane

CB> That's only a standard double hane, nothing odd.]
(;B[mq]C[S.

This seemed to be the most logical responce to what seemed to be an overplay

CB> it wasn't an overplay, since you have two weaknesses in J4 and L4.]
;W[lr]
(;B[mo];W[kp]LB[lo:A][ip:C][np:B]TR[iq][jq][kq]C[S.

I was not expecting this at all

If I play A or take at B then white will play C and my stones will be captured

I considered which stones were more important and I was not very sure.

I saved the marked stones since otherwise the other three would have to run

CB> The three stones are not so important. It's much more important to avoid to loose your influence.]

(;B[jp];W[lo];B[ko];W[lp];B[jo];W[no]
(;B[cd]C[S.

If white captures then it is not the end of the world

CB> It's big! Not only do you completely loose your influence by letting have a ponuki in the center, but your center group feels a little insecure, now.

CB> And locally, C17 is better. Here, you just help white to consolidate.]
;W[mn]
(;B[fd]C[S.

I hear that three against one stone is a bleak outcome for white

CB> It all depends on shapes. Your stones are floating, while it's still easy for white to build a base.]
;W[fc];B[gc];W[ec]
(;B[hd]C[CB> you leave a cut...];W[ed]C[CB> Now white can separate your stones, it's catastrophic.]

(;B[ch]C[S.

Perhaps I should be more agressive on white?

CB> too late, you have to be strong to be aggressive, and since you are now cut in two groups, you are weak. Another remark is that this low approach is wrong, because always gote: after a white answer at C11, the C12 black stone feels weak.]
;W[ee];B[dh];W[fe];B[gd];W[ci];B[bi];W[bj]C[S.

Continueing the sequence seems very yose to me.

Tenuki to keep initiative and to gain points elsewhere

CB> maybe... but maybe answering B12 is sente, because if white tenuki, you have the cut at C10. I would play B12, because it also makes your group more secure. It doesn't have two eyes yet.]

[dl:A]C[S.

Not sure if this is the best move

A B or C maybe better?

CB> Since you cannot kill white, B seems better to try to connect your stones.]
;W[dj];B[dl];W[ck];B[eq]TR[dp]C[S.

Put this stone under pressure

CB> Does it really work? I don't think so.]

Was afraid to atari from the other side];W[gk];B[hl];W[gi];B[mc]
TR[gc][fd][gd][hd]C[S.

Try to gain points elsewhere

Perhaps this is too far from the other group

It could be split?

CB> No it's ok. Maybe white can split your groups but he will endanger himself.]
;W[jd]C[CB> it's an abusive move.]
(;B[jc]C[CB> try not to play contact moves on an attacking stone, you are reinforcing it]

I try to save it

Good reduction by white];W[hh];B[ig];W[hg]
(;B[km]C[S.

Wasnt sure what the most important move would be so I figured I would defend some teritory

CB> Don't add weak stones like J13 if you don't take or have the time to defend them. Helping your center group is a good idea, but not for points (it won't do much), only because it can still be attacked. Locally, L7 is too close from L5. I'd maybe play something like L8 or L9.]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[cp];B[bq];W[bp]LB[en:A]C[S.

I sense a double atari at A]
(;B[fn]LB[ek:A]C[S.

Maybe I should have dealt with it after white plays A

CB> Exactly. You give back the sente to your opponent.];W[qj]
C[CB> You would play here yourself with the sente. What a difference...]
;B[qi];W[qk];B[pi]C[S.

Too passive?

I worry about the stone in the lower right hand corner

I felt that white outplayed me at pretty much every turn

He had good invasions

He had very good threats

I messed up with the monkey jump in the lower right hand corner

I don't thin I used my sanrensei as effectively as possible

Still, playing players like this is how I am going to improve.

Thanks again for reviewing the game. :)

CB> Remember:
1) Connect your stones and try to make good shape
2) Contact moves, crosscut and ataris are attacking moves (they reinforce the defender, but he is already stronger here otherwise it wouldn't be an attack so it's not a big deal) - when defending, try to avoid them (so the attacking stones have to reinforce themselves without help if they can do so)
3) Push weak opponent stones towards your strong groups and your influence (it is generally too slow and gote to try to use your influence to make points)

CB> Feel free to ask me any further question on the game.])
