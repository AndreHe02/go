AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jj]C[chilli: I play black in this handicap game. I am currently rated 10k at NNGS a
nd my opponent is 5k*. I would appreciate any feedback on the worst mistakes I m
ake and also questionable moves regarding "direction of play". I find that when  playing a handicap game I often get overly defensive, so comments on more aggres
sive ways of playing would be much appreciated. I would also like comments on wh
at my main weaknesses are.

I have also added some sporadic questions throughout the game.]

;W[bm];B[co];W[bn];B[bo];W[dj](;B[ek]C[chilli: Maybe  this is a move best left unplayed? It seems only to strengthen  white.


matt: These 2 black moves dont help much, and are gote, I like q14, r14 or l17.  see variations]

;W[el];B[ei];W[fc];B[ec]C[matt: this move strengthens white, better left unplayed, perhaps pincer instead or  on the right side at q14, etc..]
;W[fd];B[lc]C[chilli: I didn't want white to get all of the upper side, but perhaps a play a
t Q10 or thereabouts would have been better?


matt: I would play at q14 or r14, whites upper side is a lot smaller than blacks right side.
Also because of the k10 stone and e12 stones, reducing whites upper side should
not be hard];W[me];B[ke];W[ic](;B[kd]C[matt: This move is bad, its slow and doesnt accomplish much (see variations)]

;W[pf]
(;B[oc]C[chilli: Would it have been better to put pressure from the outside, R12, Q11 ?

matt: its a possibility, just give up the corner completely and try to make a hudge moyo in
the lower right.  It also leaves behind a lot of aji in the q16 stone.]

(;B[qo]C[chilli: Is defending at R3 better?


matt: Im not sure, whites group will end up without 2 eyes, but white can easily get
away i think. In one possible continuation you could put pressure on whites bottom group,
but the the p9 stones come under attack];W[qq];B[pq];W[ro]C[matt: See the variation here, its not necessarily better, but its an option]

 or bad idea?

ow I push white into my four corner stones on two points];W[od]

matt: there are a couple options, you could start a ko at s16, not sure you could win it,
i think w has more threats. As it is, you live so it turns out ok]

matt:
The main comment I have is that you should look for sente ways to defend
your stones before they are under attack. (for example, g4)   You also need to resist being pushed towards the end of the game. if you can find a bigger sente move than your oponent, ignore his.  So when you start feeling like
he is pushing you around at the end of the game, stop and look for all
your sente moves. Dont just wait for him to make a gote move.]
