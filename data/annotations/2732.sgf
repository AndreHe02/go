AB[gc][cg]C[RickMott: Hello, this will be interesting, I've never reviewed 9x9 before. :)
Because there are fewer moves, it is possible for a not-too-strong player
like me to follow variations out much further.  

The only major mistake you made was not being careful enough to
ensure eye space.  There's no room to run out on a 9x9 board, so
it is critical to check all your groups every move for potential threats
if they don't already have two eyes.

Also, in several places you played more aggressively than was needed,
giving white the opportunity to start fights.  With two stones on such a
small board, the burden is on white to start fights.  You should aim to
stay connected and take solid territory.  If white doesn't kill a large
group, he has no chance to catch up.  When you are ahead, play to
simplify the game if possible.];W[ee]C[RickMott: This should be bad for White.  On a full-size board, the center point has the
effect of  breaking most ladders and making big moyos more difficult.  At 9x9,
moyos are not an issue, so you should take one of the other two 3-3 points.]
;B[dd]C[RickMott: Playing so close gives white the opportunity to start a fight.  I might prefer the
3-3 point.  White will have a hard time making territory in the center, and you would hold
3 solid corners.];W[fc];B[fd]C[RickMott: This is an aggressive move; you don't need to fight.  Just extend at G6 and let
White worry about how to find territory.];W[ed]
(;B[gd]C[RickMott: If your idea in playing F6 was to separate White, you should follow through
with the atari at E7.  See variation.];W[ec];B[de];W[eg]
(;B[gg]C[RickMott: Better to extend at D7, making most of your opponent's stones useless.
See variation.];W[df];B[cf];W[cc]LB[dc:1][cd:3][ce:2][eh:4]
C[1 (the actual move) is a bad one, I guess - the d7 group will be highly insecure.

2 and 3 are safer, but too peaceful  

RickMott: Peaceful is good when you're ahead.... :)  but 3 is bad because you
make an empty triangle.  2 is OK because it's sente; if white doesn't respond,
you can push at 1, then C8 and (if white tries to cut at D8) sacrifice one stone
with the E8 atari to cut off white's center group.  It will have  a hard time
finding two eyes.

Now I would choose 4

RickMott: Perhaps, but I would prefer not to start a fight near your G3 stone if
you're not certain who will end with sente.  How about B6 first?  See variation.]

(;B[dc];W[db]C[
guest2627  NR : Starting observation.];B[dg]C[RickMott: This is a "thank-you" move.  You force white to become very strong facing
your G3 corner stone, for very little gain.];W[ef];B[be]C[RickMott: I think this would be better at B6.  This gives white B6 in sente, threatening
snapback.];W[bd]C[RickMott: Which he takes.];B[fh];W[eh]C[RickMott: At first, I thought white should take the snapback at C5 immediately.  It also
threatens to capture B5 if you connect underneath at E2, giving white a very big corner. 
Then I realized that this white move is sente; if you don't respond, the monkey jump
to B2 kills black.];B[dh]
(;W[di]C[RickMott: The snapback at C5 is still bigger, but if he wants to hane this is
the wrong side for white.  He should play F1 instead.   See variation.]
;B[ci];W[ei]C[RickMott: Clearly a mistake; white should take the snapback.]
