C[dmg: Hello, my name's Damien (a.k.a. dmg on OGS/DGS/KGS), I am 6k in French/European scale and I'll comment your game. I'll prefix all my comments with 'dmg'.]
;B[dp]C[dmg: Usually the first move is made in the upper-right of the board to translate the "etiquette" in real games.]
;W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[qk]
(;W[qi]C[dmg: I think you should have push at r6, building something on both direction and leave no points to black (see variation)
In this situation you don't build any point on the upper right corner and you don't make any influence.]
;B[qo]C[Black's kosumi suprised me (I'm White) - it seems too aggressive.

dmg: Just be grateful to your opponent for this move.];W[qp]
C[dmg: ...because it helps you];B[ro];W[qj]LB[pf:A][qm:B][mq:C]
[de:D][ci:E][gd:F]C[I don't know if this was the best move...

dmg: certainly not. I cannot say what is the best move (who can?).
However, you should consider the marked moves A to correct your shape with R11, B to make the situation really complicated for black (well since R11 stone is weak I would avoid this move for now). Or C to complete the bottom corner. D, E, F are also possibles (preference for D for me).

Note that R10 will remove the possibility for invasion at B.]
;B[pk];W[rk]C[This move seems slow...I started a fight here that probably should have been played later.

dmg: this seems ok to me (according to previous move) but not urgent. N3 & Q14 are still big. Also going attacking the komoku at D15 is big,]
;B[rl]
(;W[rj]C[dmg: since this is gote and the black group has no problem living it's might be better to avoid playing S10. see variation]
;B[qf]C[dmg: and here black take one point];W[qe];B[of];W[pf]
C[I figured this was one of the situations the one-point jump could be cut, and then I'd be connected...]
;B[pg];W[pe];B[og];W[qg]C[This was what I was hoping for...]
;B[qh];W[rf];B[pi];W[pj];B[ok];W[rh];B[rr]C[This seemed like an overreach on Black's part, so I cut it.

dmg: yep];W[rp];B[mq];W[rm]C[The clamp seemed like a good idea,

dmg: well it is not. It leads nowhere, it's more urgent to help the R4 stones.]
;B[qm]C[but I didn't anticipate this move.  I thought Black would connect.

dmg: this is the standard answer to this clamp.];W[so];B[rn]
C[Now I feel dumb.];W[sl]C[I got flustered and responded without thinking here.]
;B[sm];W[sp]C[dmg: this is losing a move. Since black cannot capture by playing here.]
;B[nn];W[qr]C[I want to save my corner group, at least.

dmg: good idea. You could have tried to go outside first.];B[or]
;W[pr];B[oq]
(;W[rs]C[but now black has a massive wall....

dmg: I haven't read the group situation carefully but it seems to me that this move is not necessary for life (I think white can get a seki if tennuki). See the variations.]
;B[ss]C[A mistake on Black's part?];W[sr];B[oi];W[oj]C[I want cutting points.

dmg: important];B[ni];W[nj]C[Now instead of cutting points I'm out...this is looking good.

dmg: indeed.];B[kc]C[dmg: that's a big point];W[mc]C[dmg: this is a bit submissive D15 is way bigger]
;B[nd];W[nc];B[md];W[ic]C[dmg: this is an overplay. you are giving black a group to attack and you are not attacking any group.]
;B[cf];W[fc];B[kf];W[dd]C[dmg: what's the purpose of this move? Go to L18 instead]
;B[cd];W[ed];B[cb];W[ci];B[he];W[ie];B[if];W[hd];B[je];W[jd]
C[I figured why not try a ko.

dmg: what is this ko good for?];B[kd];W[cn];B[fq];W[en]C[dmg: prefer D8 for stability of your group. The two white stones have 4 empty spots between.]
;B[ck];W[ei];B[ek];W[hn];B[bp];W[ik]C[dmg: you should cut the black group with C7, trying to connect.]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[id];W[cq]C[dmg: what is this move for? Connect at H17 and if black take you take G16.]
;B[cp];W[ie];B[oc];W[od];B[id];W[bq];B[dq];W[ie];B[bn];W[hf]
C[This was my fatal mistake.  I should have recognized that I did not win the ko, just rather failed to answer his threat and played a ko-relevant threat of my own.

dmg: indeed you fail because you fight a ko where you had nothing to win. And you lose something bigger...]
;B[cm]C[This was Black cashing in on me not responding to the threat.  I think should have just taken the stone I put in atari and left it at that...after all that's all I stood to gain by getting to play twice, and the ko is still on.]
;W[dm];B[cl];W[nk]C[I want to connect to the center, but was this too slow?  Black's groups were nigh-invincible at this point, so this cap seems pretty useless.

dmg: seems good to me. It's solid];B[nl];W[mi];B[mg]TR[qa][qb]

[an][am][bm][bl][al][nr][nq]C[I never realized how much danger I was in up in the north...I figured I had won the ko, so I assumed that everything was ok...



Black made good shape everywhere and so has strong control of the sides.  I might still be able to win by taking the ko, and focusing on connecting the center stuff.

dmg: really? Let's count a bit.
40 for white + 6 komi
45 for black.

So basically your are equal in territory. however black can easily get territory in the bottom and if you just connect you will be 15-20 points behind in the ooyose. that's not enough.

Moreover, I think it's hard to cut everything here. So try first to do something like H4 to prevent more territory for black.]
;W[ml];B[nm];W[ln];B[gm];W[gn];B[eg];W[gh]C[dmg: that's a wrong direction. Do a simple uncuttable tobi.

For now on, every problem's are reading problem so you should try to do more tsumegos and then to try to keep in mind that it's ok to leave a group sometimes...]
