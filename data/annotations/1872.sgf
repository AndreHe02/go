AB[pd][dp][pp]C[
Thanks for reviewing my game.  My basic philosophy was pretty ordinary - since I am the one with the handicap, I thought it best to "play it safe" but without giving away too much of my territory.  I am a strong believer in the notion of not being greedy.  My opponent is welcome to the other half of the board - since I just need one extra little space to win anyway.  On the other hand, people are always telling me I am "too friendly" a player, so lately I have been trying to fight a little more.  It often doesn't go well with me in those cases, unfortunately... :(

I have inserted my own observations and several questions into the game that follows.  Please don't feel limited to responding to those comments of mine - review any and every aspect of the game you think you need to, please!  :)

N - Not being greedy is a key concept of Go.  You are very right about that.  The next lesson you need is about "shape".  What you need to understand is that Go is not really about getting territory.  It's about having a stronger configuration of your stones over a larger area of the board.  Stronger shapes also win fights.  For your next several games, just forget about territory and play for shape.]
;W[dd];B[cc]C[I don't know if this is a good move or not.  My thinking was, since as the handicapee I've got influence over the other quarters of the board, then by making this move I would be kind of pushing him into my influence, and also securing a tiny bit of territory for myself.  The move didn't seem downright dangerous, anyway, so I went ahead and did it.  What do you think?

N - No, it's not good.  You are giving W a strong shape towards the middle of the board, which he can use in many ways to his benefit.  The key to a handicap game -- to any game, really -- is to connect your stones.]
;W[np];B[lp];W[qn];B[qp]MA[nn]C[N - This is heavy shape.  W should play at X, attacking your corner.  You can make the corner live, but W gains influence towards the center.]
;W[qj];B[qh]MA[lp]C[N - You seem to like these long extensions, but they are very weak.  Your marked stone is attacking W, which in turn is attacking your corner.  This is where the action is!]
;W[fq];B[hq]MA[lp]C[N - This is good, you strengthen your marked stone.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ce]MA[ep]LB[dj:a][cd:b][fr:c]C[BTW I actually ended up sacrificing this corner, though that wasn't my original plan.  Plans change...

N - This move is a disaster. You have played for influence in the bottom L.  You absolutely must play at X.  W must play A.  Then extend to A or something like that.

In any case, B is better than your move, it is much stronger.  You are inviting W to cut.]
;W[dc]C[N - A terrible move.  You have asked him to ruin your shape, but he is too busy.]
;B[cj]LB[ep:a][cd:b]C[sacrificed the corner so I could secure the side somewhat.

N - Again, A is sente (W must respond locally).  Play that first!  Anyway, B is a better move on the side -- better shape.]
;W[hd];B[lc]LB[qc:a][ep:b][cd:c][pn:d]MA[np]C[Was this a good point to jump out to?

N - No, I don't think so.  It doesn't take territory (W can still take the corner at A), and it doesn't attack, it doesn't move into the middle.    You have very good moves at B, C, and D.  Look for a tactical advantage, forget territory.  D forces W to make territory on the side while you move into the middle and attack the marked stone.  C stabilizes your side and gives you a strong base to make some real territory, or even to eventually attack.]
;W[cm];B[fp]C[N - Cut me!  Cut me!];W[ep];B[eo];W[eq];B[em]
C[N - Ouch!];W[fo];B[gp];W[do]MA[em]TR[fo]C[I didn't realize til this move that I had lost the corner, which made me feel a little silly.  My opponent got exactly what he wanted - a big territory in the corner, and I didn't really get a very good development on the outside, so I think this was a pretty bad sequence for me.  What would you have done?

N - Well, as I've said, your mistake was really a long time ago.  But your marked stone was a very bad move.  It should be where W played (triangled).

But most importantly, just take a look at X.  Learn to hate that look.  That is the look of stones which are not connected, which are waiting to be cut up!]
;B[en];W[co];B[cn];W[bn];B[bo];W[bp];B[dl]C[
With those last few moves, I was just trying some shenanigans that didn't work, but since he had to play stones to answer I figured I wasn't changing the score any.]
;W[cd];B[be];W[de];B[df];W[ef];B[dg];W[bd];B[eg];W[ff];B[gg]
;W[on]MA[gg]C[N - This move is very important.  If you take it first, you gain influence while you attack.  X should have been here.]
;B[jf]LB[ln:a][jc:b][qd:c]C[N - This is thin. Play at A, B, or C.]
;W[jp];B[ln];W[jn];B[io];W[jo];B[gn]MA[lq]C[Was this too defensive?

N - Yes, I think X would be a good move...it defends your group, while also threatening to connect to the corner, which is weak.]
;W[kl];B[ll];W[kk];B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[mo];B[mp];W[nn];B[nq]
;W[lo];B[jq];W[kp];B[kq]C[I must admit I felt kind of clever for connecting all that stuff together.  I had to think about the sequence for a while before I saw it.  I thought I could use the two stones above the corner after securing the corner, but they turned out pretty weak.  (Until the very end when my opponent made a blunder, but I get no congratulations for that.)]
;W[mj];B[mh];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]MA[nc]C[So I know that move looks crazy . And I guess I didn't even need to try aggressive tactics - I'm currently winning, I think.  (Tell me if that is true or not, btw.  I need to work on score estimation.)  But like I said, people tell me I am too friendly a player, and I really didn't want white to get the corner because maybe it could have put him over the edge.  With this move, I had a plan which worked pretty much as I figured it would for the next several moves, but I screwed it up later in the game, as we shall see...

N - Well, it's doable, but I think X is better, it connects your stones.]

;W[nd];B[ld];W[ne]C[Kurisu [15k\]: this is hard...];B[oi]LB[ri:a]
[ib:b]C[N - This is an odd move.  If you are trying to limit the size of the W territory, A is better, but B is better still, because it protects your stones while reducing W's territory.]
;W[oj];B[rd]LB[ri:a][ro:b][ib:c][ad:d][hk:e]C[That's the screw-up, I think.  I suspect this move lost me the game.  Funny, I tried something aggressive, and totally messed it up by following up with a move that was *way too safe.*  Am I right that this move was absolutely not necessary?  I think I should have gone O11 or something like that instead.  What do you think?

N - Well, you're in the endgame now, more or less.  You want to expand your territory while limiting W's.  A, B, C, and D are all sente, so you should not hesitate to play them.  They are sente, you can play them all, one after the other!  E is worth quite a bit, too.]
;W[ni];B[oh]MA[nh]TR[rd]C[N - If you play at X instead, you may be able to kill his upper side group (because the triangled stone is so strong!)]
;W[nh];B[ng];W[mg];B[mi];W[nj];B[lg];W[mf]C[N - All of your next five moves or so are weak.  You are protecting the stones which seem to be immediately threatened without looking ahead.  Like you said, Go is a game of trading...you should be ready to sacrifice something, you can't keep it all.  See variations.]

C[With these moves I was just being silly, seeing if I could develop anything from all my stones behind enemy lines.  I thought maybe I could make the group in the center top live.  Turned out, this wasn't the way to do it, if there was a way at all.  (Was there?)]

But in any case, the game went from being definitely his to being a close game.  Tell me if you think there were any better moves from this point on that might have put me over his 5 point lead.

N - Sure!  You had the chance to cut at X several times!  He should be playing there now.]

N - Learn to avoid weak shapes.  Connect your stones, while you cut your opponents'.  If you learn to watch for cutting moves, and play strong shapes, you will be 12K right away :)]
