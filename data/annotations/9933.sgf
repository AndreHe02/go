C[This is a game on Tygem I  played against a 17k player there. I am white (also 17k).

$ Hi, I'm Stefan. Let's see if I can be of help.];B[pd];W[cp]
;B[op];W[eq]C[$ This seems very cautious. You should play in the remaining corner.]
;B[qo]C[$ I think White can still live in the corner if necessary.]
;W[cd];B[qj]C[* Bad. Black should approach at e16 or e17 which is backed by the Q16 stone.]
;W[cj]C[$ Hmm. Both players seem very concerned about the safety of their stones. In my opinion this is waaay too passive at this stage. One important thing in Go is sente: Being in charge of play, and pursuing ones goals, while the opponent can only react. You should always try to find a move which your opponent must respond to, and which gives you a good followup.

This move just cedes the initiaive to Black while trying to carve out a smallish piece of territory. Note that it is easy for the oponnent to break into the left side or reduce it to something very small.

Also, as you see later in the game, this does not secure territory as Black will break into your moyo just around this stone.

To secure territory, you would have to play closer to the corner(s): c8, e17. Note that c13 would be the wrong direction.

I think this would be bad nonetheless: Better to play moves that are good for your position and give Black something to do at the same time. For example, White could have approached the top right corner. If Black defends White can build a moyo on the top.

The same applies to Black's previous move, and many of the following ones ;)]
;B[jc];W[fc];B[nc]C[$ White can still take the corner. Anyway this is the wrong idea and too small. Blacks idea is probably to have both the corner and the territory between k17 and o17. However White can play both r17 and m17.

Black can even play k4 and punish Whites passiveness.];W[jq]
;B[lq]
(;W[hp]C[$ See the variation - I think e10 or k5 would have been better here]
;B[ko]
(;W[jn]C[Here I was trying to block the peep here. I knew it would lead to a wall in the center. I wasn't sure of a better move.
How to better deal with the peep at K5? I think either sliding under at M2 or focusing on making my territory stronger would be good. (like C13 or C7). Or would invading his territory be better?

$ If you are OK with getting the wall this move is good IMO. c7 and c13 are gote and as such bad. M2 helps the opponent fix his weak corner.]
;B[kn];W[jl];B[jo];W[in];B[km]
(;W[jm]C[$ This is bad shape: Look at the empty triangle at j7.

I have added some standard variations];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[ji]
C[Tried to gain an advantage and get ahead here.

$ It's good to build a wall, but your left side is too thin to defend entirely. At least the wall should help.]
;B[jj];W[ij];B[ki];W[ii];B[kh];W[jg];B[jh];W[ih];B[kg];W[jf]
;B[kf];W[je];B[ke];W[id];B[jd];W[ic];B[jb];W[ib];B[kq];W[jp]
C[$ j4 is a little more secure here];B[io];W[ho]C[I was bocking the largest area from black.]
;B[ip];W[iq];B[ch];W[cf]C[$ I think e10 would have been best here: It separates the black stone from a possible later invasion in the c7 area, and thus forces Black to live in the cramped space c-f 12-15. However you are strong here, with a great wall in the center, so Black will struggle anyway.]
;B[cl];W[cn]C[$ Now this is definitely bad. You allow Black to enclose your c10 stone for just a few points. Separate black with e10! Two weak black groups are great for you.]
;B[bj]
(;W[ej]C[I was trying to esape and prevent black from getting more eye space

$ I have added a variation which would have allowed you to resist more.

In this situation, I believe it is almost impossible to kill the black invasion. Important thinigs to consider are:
* Keep the opponent separated.
* Help your weak stones.

However, you could benefit in the following way:
* Attack the black group so that it must be defended; don't let Black live too easily.
* Profit by doing this in a way that secures the most possible territory for you, by blocking the Black group away from the larghest space.

The variation gives a hint.];B[ck];W[bh]C[I need to focus on closing him in from the outside here. Something like E 12.

$ Black can just play b13 here - read it out!];B[ci];W[dj];B[bi]
;W[bl]C[I was trying to reduce black's eye space. I think I should have focused on enclosing black from the outside more.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[bk];W[bg];B[al]C[$ Black is alive.

From here on, counterattack should be your goal now. (It would have been easier earlier on)]
;W[ai]C[$ Don't bother with this now - this is an endgame move.

One detail here - maybe you were _hoping_ that Black does not see the threat so you can play a10 and threaten his group again. It is a very bad idea to play "tricky" like this. One should always assume that the opponent does see all the tiny little threats hidden behind one's moves. Find the moves he cannot defend against! This way of thinking also helps to play the more plain but solid move.]
;B[aj];W[ah]C[$ Not necessary to defend. Play something bigger somewhere else.]
;B[eh];W[gh]C[$ Wrong direction - you want to keep the area towards the top. e14!]
;B[cg];W[bf];B[df];W[ff]C[Trying to cut black off here.

$ You drive him into the top area. d15 seems better.];B[de]
;W[dd];B[ef]C[$ Black plays some bad moves as well ;) Not necessary, Black should either secure the bottom left corner,  or play e8 or f11.]

;W[hm];B[gp]C[$ This is an empty threat. You don't need to defend - 2 points are nothing. Take sente!]
;W[hn];B[kl]C[$ Big one for Black.];W[qg]C[$ I think r17 would have been better]
;B[qe]C[$ Black defends well];W[ql]C[I should have tried to make a base first, at S 11. I thought it would confuse him or something.

$ s11 is too small to get a base. Try to read it out.];B[qi]
C[$ Now you see why it's so good to keep the enemy separated.]
;W[og];B[rm];W[oi];B[ph];W[pg];B[oh];W[ok];B[nh];W[om]C[I was trying to make good shape for some eye space here.

;B[am]C[I resigned here.

$ Just for the book, I think invading at r3 was still possible, though this would not have turned the game.

I think your lessons should be:
* Don't think of your moyo as your territory too early. It is often surprisingly difficult to defend against all odds. 
* Don't think that you own anything at all in the opening - it's about coming into the better position for the middle and end game, not for securing profit.
* Don't play out every exchange instantaneously. It is usually better to leave them for the endgame as they are usually small. They are important for ko fights as well.
* Try to hang on to your sente. If your opponent must react to your moves, he does not have time to pursue his own plans.
* In a related way, you don't need to react to all of your opponent's moves. If there's only a few points to lose, there is usually something bigger somewhere else. For _every_ move, you should consider to tenuki!

Other difficulties (defending against invasions, surviving in enemy territory) will probably straighten out with more experience.

Good luck for the future!])
