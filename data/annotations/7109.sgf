Lenght of overtime period: 0:00:05

Reflame: Thanks for letting me review your game. I learned much 
myself during this review.

For both of you, the main thing to improve is to solve go 
problems. Do it often. An excellent server is 
www.goproblems.com. 

I recommend to choose "Test for time" in upper right, because 
there you can choose difficulty from a very fine scale.

Do not hesitate to ask eventual questions (if I explained something 
not clearly) by email.];W[pp]C[Zedus [19k?\]: Good luck];B[dd]
;W[do]C[Reflame: White now violated the rule "Dont attach when attacking" 
(see http://senseis.xmp.net/?DontAttachWhenAttacking).

http://senseis.xmp.net/?44PointJosekis (the diagram there contains 
hyperlinks)];B[eo];W[dn];B[en];W[cp];B[ep]C[Reflame Black D3 is stronger. The move which was played (E4) is 
OK if black is unable to calculate whether W can cut. But it is 
important to practise and improve in this ability.];W[dq];B[dm]
C[Reflame: Black E3 is better, because if W playes there he gains 
much.];W[cm];B[cl];W[bm];B[bl];W[al]C[Reflame mistake, which was soon punished]
;B[cn];W[co];B[bn];W[bo]C[Reflame: Good. It is usually bad to try to save what cannot be 
saved (a frequent beginner mistake). 

But this is an illustrative exception: W put his stone "for free" (Bl 
must respond) and this stone brings a nonzero gain (protects Wh 
territory). W can put this stone for free and then make a move 
which brings a bigger gain.];B[am];W[de]C[Reflame: Same mistake as playing E5

W 
stones) as soon as you see that it was wrong];B[jp]C[H4 and J7 (in any order) would be a more efficient way to block

2. After Bl F14 there is a single (very weak) stone partly surrounded 
by bl stones. It will create a very weak group.

one)];B[ff];W[ge];B[ef];W[fg];B[gf]C[Last two black moves were better than what I would play :-)))))))))

My first idea was to play something more aggresive (for example  
H14 instead of G14) and so I wanted 
to write that Bl plays too safe...  

But after a closer look, these aggresive moves for black would end 
in disaster.

This safe play for Black is exatly the correct one.];W[gg]C[This move helps the W group very little (Bl group has more 
liberties). I think K16 is much better.];B[gc]C[W group has much fewer liberties, so I think B should worry less 
about the safety of Bl group and more to prevent W from running 
away. This is why I would play K16, although it is difficult for me to 
calculate the variations exactly (that means I am not quite sure).]
;W[hd]C[J16 is better (cannot be disconnected)];B[hf]C[Good - prevents connecting]
;W[if]C[This stone can be cut from the others and easily rid of liberties. K16 
is much better.];B[ie];W[id];B[jf];W[ig];B[hg]C[K16 is better]

;W[ic];B[he];W[ke];B[je]C[Good - saves 2 stones from being cut]
;W[jc];B[fc]C[Needless - a Wh cutting stone at this position can be caught into 
ladder. Chasing Wh is the urgent thing. To keep L15 disconnected, 
L16 or M17 is a good move];W[dc]C[I cannot see any purpose in this move. B group cannot be captured 
because it has many liberties around K13];B[eb]C[No purpose]
;W[gb]C[Again];B[hb]C[Not bad, but both players forget that after Wh L16, the Wh group has 
a good chance to live, because then a Bl cutting stone at L17 would 
be in a big risk of being captured. 

So a correct Bl move is to prevent this.];W[fb]C[The Wh stone was obviously doomed, so trying to save it only 
increases the loss for Wh];B[ga];W[ib]C[L16 is the only move]
;B[fa];W[db]C[This move is no threat for Black so it only prevents Black from 
reducing Wh territory (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?MonkeyJump)

group or making territory by S9];B[ec]C[This move brings Bl nothing. 

I recommend the players to look at each move which I marked as 
pointless and realize why they played there, what benefit they 
expected - and then think whether the move really brings anything.]

very little compared with other moves.];B[da];W[ca];B[ea]C[This saves less than one point for Bl (the world "less" expresses 
that we do not know who would win the KO in the endgame).];W[ia]

move.];B[kc]C[Very good - prevents l15 stone from connecting. White group is 
doomed.];W[kb];B[kd]C[M17 is better - it prevents Wh more effectively from escaping and 
making eyes.];W[lc]C[Very good];B[ld];W[md]C[This is an overplay, because it can be punished by Bl N17
 (http://senseis.xmp.net/?Overplay)

;W[kf]C[Pointless - black can capture by playing M13 
(http://senseis.xmp.net/?Net)];B[me]C[N17 is better, because this move leaves a big chance that Wh will 
make eyes. White should punish this Bl move by N18];W[ne]C[Should be N18]

move.];W[mb];B[nb]C[Very good];W[na]C[Wh is dead. If he is able to realize it, he should not increase his 
loss by playing here. 

If he is not absolutely certain that he is dead, 
then it is better to continue playing, when such big group is at stake. 

If Wh knows he has no chance (in case of correct play) and he only 
hopes that Bl makes a mistake, this is called Trick play 
(http://senseis.xmp.net/?TrickPlay). It would be a bad habit to get 
used to do such things, although they sometimes work.];B[oa]
C[Mistake (should be at 18th line instead).

White can punish it and rescue the group.

After this move, Wh group is alive (with correct play from both 
players).];W[ma]C[Correct];B[ka]C[If black is able to calculate (read) the situation exactly, and if he 
does not assume that Wh will make a mistake, then he should play 
P18 to minimize his loss.

Because he has no move which captures Wh group.

Calculation (reading) is a difficult thing and Bl  made this 
move because he was not certain whether Wh can be captured. 

But if the other possibilty was true (Bl played a trick play), then I 
must emphasise that one should try NOT to play a "trick play" 
against oponents of similar strenght. When one learns not to play 
tricks, he will gradually become stronger. When one gets used to 
tricks, he will have a hard time to un-learn this habit when he 
becomes stronger and this habit will harm him.

By making this move, Bl risks to lose some points in the corner.]
;W[ob]C[Very good!];B[pb];W[pa]C[Until now, white made exactly the correct moves to punish Bl 
mistake. White group was alive.

But this Wh move is wrong - he should capture the other bl stone.

not sure, it is ok to try. But when one does manage to calculate, it is

C[A big mistake - should be T18];W[sb]C[Very good.];B[sc]C[This brings nothing. I would play R10, it extends Bl territory and 
puts a slight pressure on Wh stones L14 to S14.];W[qa]C[Wh group is save, so this is not needed. It loses one move and 1 
point. (But if Wh is not sure, it is an accaptable move in order not to 
risk a life of a big group.)];B[sf]C[This brings little, it is too early in the game for such small moves]
;W[rg];B[hc]C[This brings almost nothing];W[sg]C[This brings very little (with correct Bl answer), but it is quite 
good because black must respond. (See 
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Sente) 

Black must respond by N16 (this is tronger than black R16 
because it leaves a smaller ko-threat - this will be important if 
a ko-fight occurs later.];B[se]
(;W[qc]C[Good - White exploited Bl mistake.

But if I calculate right, L12 would capture the whole black 
group, D19 to T14. It has only one true eye (see 
http://senseis.xmp.net/?FalseEye).

L12 would start a thrilling battle whose 
outcome (and life of the bl group) would depend on a ko (if I 
calculate correctly).

Generally, ko is a better result for white than a safely living 
black group. (Especially if the game seemed bad for Wh, 
which is not the case here). 

The problem here is that Wh has no good threats. If he had 
some, then L12 would be certainly correct.

I entered several variations how the fighting might proceed.

PS: Later I found and added a variation where WH captures certainly 
(not dependent on KO). So L12 would be a great move in any case.]
;B[lf]C[M13 is far better - Bl would have two eyes];W[rd];B[md]
;W[kg];B[lg]C[******** At first I wrote this: ***************

K12 is stronger, because then Wh has to choose between 
preventing Bl M12 and preventing Bl cut at G12.

This cut does not bring big problems to Wh (because in order 
to capture Wh stones H9 to J14, black would have to cut O8 
group either from J12 or from P14, which has little chance to 
succeed)

But it does bring some problems to Wh, because Bl can 
attack these weak stones and gain advantage while Wh 
has to respond and struggles for survival.

Another choice is to play G12 right now.

******** But then I realized: ***************

The black group in the upper edge has only one eye. 
Therefore it is absolutely neccessary that it flees far enough 
to make a second one. One cannot use weak groups to 
attack opponent's weak groups, because the hunter would 
soon become the hunted. The Bl group is much weaker than 
white stones after cut at G12, so there is no point in that cut.

(at least in the view of my poor beginner's eyes :-))) )];W[kh]

But this move is goos, because it partly protects agains cut 
at N9 and therefore cut at G12 will do much less harm.

If black sees even the smallest chance that he can save his group, 
then the tenuki at S2 was very wrong - because White could ignore it 
and make a move against the big black group (which, at least in black's 
opinion, had a chance if black did not abandon the fight)

I must also say that losing the big black group would be such disaster 
for black, that it is acceptable to continue the fight even in case that 
black realizes that it is doomed in case of correct play. (This slighty 
differ from "trick play" because black has now no solid way to win the
