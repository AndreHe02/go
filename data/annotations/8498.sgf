C[Hello I am black in this game, I had a good feeling about the game at the beginning because i was strong and white had some very weak groups, but I didn't manage to get profit while attacking them, I don't know where I went wrong. Thanks for your comments !]

Possible for white to play A, black B (can't play O4 as ladder is unfavourable) and white C, so the lower side has lower value.]

If black responded with B then invade at C.];W[hq]C[Here is a very big sequence, I think this maybe made me lose, because he shut the corner later ... I didn't know wht to do here, was it possible to attack this white stone, good to take the corner, or just make an exchange and get stronger to attack whit's other weak groups ?

Black should play D3, please look at the variations.]

Black C3 is a must.]

Black A better, while B is the last big point on board.

I shall end the review here.

Sorry for making you waited for so long, I blamed myself for procrastinating and my busy schedule.
