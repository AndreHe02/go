GL: Hi, I'm Graham Lamburn (topazg on KGS), currently between KGS 1d and 2d. I hope to give useful comments and insights where I can (marked with GL:), and I've summarised the key points at the end of the sgf. Where I'm offering or annotating variations that deviate from the game, I mark the game move with a square and the deviation with a triangle (including your variations if you provided them and I commented on them). If I'm simply offering alternative moves as a comment, I normally mark each with a triangle, and most variations have a comment at the end.

I'm afraid I started reviewing the game as Black, so I've left those comments in (prefixed appropriately) for you to read alongside the rest :)]
;B[dp];W[pq];B[dc];W[pd];B[po];W[qo];B[qn];W[qp];B[pm];W[nq]
;B[qi];W[qg]TR[jd][ci]SQ[nc]C[GL: To be honest, I'm not convinced about the timing on this one. I'd be drawn to approach the top left (as you did later), as your stone can't be made into a weak group. That being said, this isn't a bad choice. Aiming at moves involving R8 this helps your corner slightly, and at the same time works towards keeping Black's group a bit weak. As Black can handle those weaknesses by approaching R14 directly, the timing here is probably fine.]
(;B[nc]TR[pc]SQ[pb]C[(as Black) GL: Perfectly playable, but I'd be more inclined towards the left side or the top middle, just because White already has an effective response to this move at R13.]
(;W[pb]TR[kd]SQ[pf]C[GL: Q17 is standard.]
(;B[pf]C[(as Black) GL: This move seems a bit strange .. it's not entirely clear what the goal is here? It's not particularly aji-keshi, but it doesn't seem particularly consistend with the board. My initial tendency would be to develop the top (as is normal from the approach)]
;W[qf];B[pe];W[qe];B[od];W[oc];B[ob]C[(as Black) GL: Good exchange to play first!]
;W[pc];B[ne];W[de]TR[fd]SQ[ce]C[GL: Excellent! C14 is also playable, but I like this.]
(;B[ce]TR[dd]SQ[cf]C[(as Black) GL: Inconsistent. He's just built a wall in the top right, and should be aiming to expand on that.]
(;W[cf]C[*** Important point ***

GL: When picking josekis, it's always tempting to go with the simplest ones, or the ones you know best, but it's a very important to pick according to the whole board. At this point, the result in the top right has a big impact on the choice here - outwards facing thickness often does.

He wants the top edge, so you're better off playing the avalance and building your own wall to neutralise his.]
;B[cd];W[df];B[fc]C[(as Black) GL: He can also consider E16, aiming to develop the top more quickly by getting up to the 4th line.]
;W[cj]TR[fe][cn][jq]SQ[cm]C[GL: Good, important to play this before handling the top.]
(;B[cm]TR[gd]SQ[fq]C[(as Black) GL: This seems a little undecided. Either securing the corner with an additional move makes sense, with C6, or taking a large point on the bottom makes sense. This neither develops many points, nor secures the 3-3 from invasion, and seems to do not quite enough of either.

To be honest, this corner doesn't seem particularly urgent. The 4-4 stone will handle itself from any / either approach moves, and neither side is that large as both adjacent White stones (C10 and O3) are on the third line.

Instead, I'd really want to play the excellent F15. Having invested those stones in the top right, you want to try and milk as much cash out of them as you can if possible, and aiming for a fast development helps you to do this.]
(;W[fq]TR[dq]SQ[hq]C[*** Important point ***

GL: Although this final approach seems large, the top has a larger investment in it, and a greater potential for points. As a general rule, influence (such as this position in the lower left, exerting itself along the lower side) is less urgent than thickness.

Moves like bF15 or wG16 need to become something you look for instinctively, as killing the potential for a framework is at least as important as edge fuseki extensions. In this case, it's only Black threatening to build a framework (instead of both colours), but as Black's position in the top right is fairly thick, it's still very important to reduce quickly.]
(;B[hq]C[(as Black) GL: Overplay. Simply D3 to secure points with sente.]
;W[cq]C[GL: Now his stones feel a bit out of place, and he needs to be careful not to end up with a thick wall of no great use.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[bn];B[bm];W[cn]
;B[dn]TR[dm]SQ[jq]
(;W[jq]C[GL: If you can't cut at D7 right now, you virtually can. Protecting that cut with E8 (shape move) is an important honte move for Black.]
;B[lq]TR[jo]SQ[lp]C[(as Black) GL: Again, overplay! Black now allows you to start making potential use of F3. M3 is an isolated stone, so all you have to do is jump out, and you can invest effort in making the wall of stones at D4 return nothing.]
(;W[lp]C[*** Important point ***

GL: Simply jump out, Black has far more problems to solve than White, as F3 is just useful sacrificial aji.

In this position, White effectively played a contact play (normally a defensive way of finding a quick route to settle) and then settled the side _that was already strong_. You were quite right to want to treat K3 urgently, but you then let Black really properly cut it off. H4 is another idea with the same theme, but play to help K3, not O3 (which doesn't need it).]
;B[mp];W[mq]C[GL: An unfortunate choice for White. It's difficult now to make up for the loss on the lower side.]
;B[kp];W[lo];B[kq]TR[kp][lq]SQ[lp][jq]C[GL: Good result for Black, he can be satisfied here. This marked broken shape for White is very painful.]
;W[ko];B[jp];W[no];B[mn];W[mo];B[nn]C[(as Black) GL: Somewhat crude. These two stones aren't very happy with respect to shape, and making a wall here is premature with P12/Q12 wide open. Better instead to try to develop the top side (again, with F15), and use the threat of P12 to make value out of N6.]
;W[md]C[GL: Nothing wrong with this. G16 directly would have been my choice, but Black can't easily ignore.]
;B[mc]TR[ld]SQ[kd]
(;W[kd]C[GL: Too thin - There's no way Black can ignore the thick extension, which gives you the ability to really damage Black's position on the top side.]
;B[ld];W[pg]C[GL: I like playing light and skilful sabaki, but it's too expensive to play those two stones and then ignore them. Black can respond with L15 here now and start making a large top left. This is a big move, but you're probably better finishing what you started.]
;B[ni]TR[le]SQ[nf]
(;W[nf]C[GL: You know you can get the M15 exchange, so play it first.]
;B[me]TR[lc]SQ[jo]
(;W[jo]C[GL: A bit direction, but handling the top is even more urgent now.]
;B[io];W[in];B[ho];W[hn];B[fo];W[ej]C[GL: The top side is still more urgent (although this does nicely activated the D7 cut).]
;B[gf]TR[ge][le]SQ[fe]
(;W[fe]C[GL: This move is simply damaging to White. It serves no advantage (apart from maybe one or two points around E14 if you're lucky), and strengthens Black nicely. At the very least play G15 and try to make things a bit messy.]
;B[ge];W[nh];B[oi];W[lg];B[kf];W[kg];B[jf];W[lf];B[le];W[jg]
;B[if]C[GL: In the last 10-12 moves, you've gifted a lot of points to Black, without any clear compensation. How many points have all those moves actually given White? Have they really prevented Black from gaining as many points (potentially) in the middle as they've guaranteed Black to get on the edge?]
;W[fd];B[gc];W[gd];B[hd];W[gn]C[misread

GL: It happens :)];B[el];W[go];B[gp];W[fp]C[continuation of the misread :)]
;B[gq];W[fr];B[es];W[eo];B[fn];W[en];B[fm];W[co];B[em]C[unnecessary]
;W[gk]C[small I guess

GL: Yes, if you want to play in this area, it is more important to fix the K6 cut.]
;B[km];W[jm];B[kk];W[ql]C[too late

GL: Getting S11+S12 in sente is not something to be unhappy about though, so it's not too bad.]
;B[rn]C[GL: Better is S7 shape-wise.

*** This is the end of the comments really, as the moments that really impacted the outcome of the flow of the game have already passed, and I find it's better to focus more on less moves than vice-versa ***]

;B[ie];W[lc]C[ookwrd [4k\]: ty];B[nd];W[kb];B[jc];W[kc]C[*** Summary ***
The opening in this game was relatively interesting. The core points were, interestingly enough, the lack of attention to the position at the top, and a 10 move sequence in the middle that earned Black quite a bit and White almost nothing.

*** Important Points ***
26 - Pick josekis according to the whole board (adjacent corners particularly, opposite when josekis involve a ladder)
31 - Thickness is urgent
48 - Play contact to settle weak stones / groups
76-86 - All your moves must have tangible purpose. Make points, or take them away, but don't play on dame.

*** Recommendations ***
The really important moves and sequences to look at is the moves around the top edge prior to black playing G14 (move 75). Even the joseki choice in the top left is important, but learning to keep an eye out for how thickness can affect the potential to make points is a crucial skill to develop. In this game, Black didn't make the most of his opportunities, but still was the first to play in that area and had a good advantage at the end until he didn't read the sequence out at the top well enough. I'd recommend thickness books (such as "All about thickness", by Ishida Yoshio) to have a look at the sorts of results professionals find really good, and try to find a few joseki options that give you the choice of which direction you want to take based on your opponent responding to corner approach moves.

I hope these comments are in some way helpful. If you have any responses / queries / comments or would like further input on specific moves or areas, do feel free to ask!]

It only takes a move or two and this top edge can be reduced to nothing more than third line territory. Take advantage of all those stones invested (particularly the top right stones, which are reliant on their value coming from a fast development of the top side).]
