C[Hi, thanks for reviewing.

Even though I won this game, I am not quite sure how and why this occured; I do know that I made a few rather glaring mistakes, but I don't know where I came back from them.]
N[Start];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]
(;W[np]C[I have always been unsure of what to do during the opening, whether I should play towards my opponents stones or whether I should begin building a moyo.

rehn: It would be a misstake to passively try to build a moyo. In this part of the game it is more about building influence. Here I would probably played o7, see variations.]
;B[po]C[rehn: The approach you chose made it little to easy for black to cover and it is hard to find any really good continuation for white.]
;W[ph]C[It also doesn't help that I know no common josekis by heart.

rehn: I think I know only one or two. It is way to early for you to try to learn josekis by heart. The only reason to study josekis early is to get a feeling for the flow of the stones. In many josekis one player gets some territory and the other influence. You first have to know when to strive for what in which situation.]
;B[mc];W[ol]C[In hindsight, this move does not seem good. All it does is cause my opponent to build a stronger moyo, which ends up, in the end, becoming territory. I probably should have played a bigger move elsewhere.

rehn: There is better moves, but your stones to the right radiates influence across the board. The problem is that they are to loose. They lack any base and are easily split and attacked.]
;B[pm];W[ip];B[dj]C[rehn: When your opponent has a single week stone, try to find some way to use that to strenghten yourself and maybe take some territory, while she strives to stabilise her stones. See variation.]

(;W[rd];B[qf];W[qc]C[rehn: It is too early to invade the corner. Your opponent will get outside influence that will affect the rest of the game while you get only a few points of territory.]
;B[rb];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ne];W[nd]TR[oc]C[I was a bit nervous about this formation that I had made. One problem with my play that I need to work out is, in addition to the fuseki and joseki, how close I should play to my own stones. I played sort of loose here, and, although it sort of worked out in the end, perhaps connecting with my own stones would have been a better idea.

rehn: It is always a good idea to keep your stones connected. Likewise to cut your opponents stones apart whenever possible. The diagonal connection like the one between the marked stones is often safe. If your stones are threatened and you cannot easily get life along the side, run out towards the center.]
;B[od];W[nc];B[me];W[mb];B[lc];W[lb];B[kb];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd]
;B[md];W[jb];B[fc];W[dh]LB[cf:A][df:B][cg:C]C[rehn: This answer to black F7 is too loose. A and B is the most common ones. Under some cirkumstances, C can be played.]
;B[cf]C[rehn: As you see, black can come between]
(;W[ch]LB[ee:A]C[rehn: Playing a A both divide the marked black stones as well as letting white get out towards the center. Later one of blacks stones can be attacked. See variation.]
;B[cc];W[ce];B[dc];W[fd];B[hc];W[id]LB[cm:A]TR[fd]SQ[dj]C[rehn: I don't see the meaning with the marked stones. They really don't attack the black stones or seel them in. They are too loose. I would rather have played at A to attack the squared black stone and in the same time strenghten the corner.]
;B[dm];W[ic]C[rehn: Too small this early.];B[hb];W[pf];B[pe]

;W[jh];B[jg];W[ki]C[Oops!];B[ke];W[ld]C[Double oops.];B[jd]
TR[jh][ki]C[I was playing too fast, and not paying as much attention as I should have been. (a major problem I have when playing on the internet.) Well, I certainly learned my lesson. From here on my confidence was shaken, because this mistake punched a hole through what I thought was a solid group of stones.

rehn: of course you lost a few points, but it was no mayor disaster. Try to see which stones that are important. Those that connects you or cuts your opponent and of course those that is important for the life of your groups. If you take good care of the marked stones, they may be much more important for the outcome of the game.]
;W[li]TR[jb][ic][id]SQ[dj][dm]C[My opponent let me off easy, because he could have killed the  mark stones and there wouldnt have been much I could do about it.

rehn: There are much more important things to play about. The whole lower side is unsettled and the squared black stones are still weak.]
;B[nn];W[mm]LB[ml:A]C[rehn: It is good to try to run out with the black stones, but a stone at A would be harder to cut.]
;B[nl];W[ql];B[rk];W[qm]C[Again, I should have played elsewhere.

rehn: yes :-)];B[qn];W[ka]C[I was still pretty shaken from the mistake I made, and only now I realize that those stones were in danger, and that I should try to protect my formation.]
;B[co]TR[ib]C[I wasn't sure about this marked spot, and I felt that I should have played there, but I decided to respond to his tenuki.

rehn: Good. Better to protect the valuable corner than to save two or three stones.]
;W[bp]LB[cp:A]C[rehn: Too lose again. This one space jump can be used farther away from enemy stones. This close you need to play more tight. Now black can cut immediately. A would have been a better move.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[er]C[rehn: Seal him in and let him live small in the corner at get outside influence. See variations.]

(;W[br];B[gq];W[hr]C[I wasn't really sure what to do at this point, whether to attempt to stop his movement towards the right or to try to fight his connection to the stones on the left side. In hindsight, I should have done the latter.

rehn: yes, never let yourself be sealed in if you are not absolutely sure about getting life along the edge or in the corner.]
;B[fo]C[He now capitolizes on my apparent mistake.];W[dq];B[ep]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[eo];B[fp];W[do];B[cn];W[dr];B[en]C[rehn: Now it is you that have a small life in the corner and black has outside influence. The black group on the middle left is stronger and the white stones on the middle lower side is starting to look week.]

rehn: even if there was no extra eye in the triangled position, black could have got two eyes playing both above and below the stone you played.]

Thank you very much for reviewing this game!

rehn: Try to get a better idea of what you are trying to accomplish with every move. Especially in the opening you seemed a bit lost. Remember cutting apart your opponents stones and connecting your own. Don't got sealed in. Build strength by attacking your opponent where she is weak.
One book that helped me a lot when I were at approximately your level was "The second book of go".]
