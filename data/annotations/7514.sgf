AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Good evening :)
I am Talaer on KGS and am around 2 kyu myself. I will place comments on the moves that I feel could be improved in some way. Let me know if you have any other questions after this. Feel free to add me to your friend's list on KGS, too!
-----
im an eight kyu on KGS. Im black
White is a three kyu.

i would like you the reviewer the tell me about my slow moves and bad moves please.

I won but i want to know how can i have played better.];W[nq]
;B[qn];W[fq];B[cn];W[jp];B[jd]C[Some might say that you should attack the W stones below, but I think this is perfectly acceptable too. A move this large means that W is still going to have the burden of securing the W stones at the bottom later.]
;W[cl]C[I think W is asking a bit much here. Surely he will damage his lower side or end up very weak on the left side.]

(;B[dq]C[Good, solid move. I would be tempted to play at E2, myself to try to be more "active", but W could also try to cause more trouble with that move.]
;W[fo]
(;B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[cj]C[W is now a lot harder to attack and B did not gain much from these moves.]
;B[cg]C[Yes, attacking in this way extends your influence while keeping pressure on the W stones.
--
i feel i had a really good start. C13 was to stop W extening...was it right?]
;W[fk]C[It may feel small, but I think it would be best to use a move here to keep these stones disconnected.]

(;B[pj];W[gm]C[W takes the time to add strength here.];B[md]
TR[fk][gm]SQ[pj]C[As previously noted, W played correctly. You did get moves to develop a large moyo, but now that W has a strong area, he can afford to make more weak groups.
--
i feel W played slow....cos for his 2 plays i got a huge moyo....yes? or was W playing right?]
;W[ni]C[This seems strange, though.]
(;B[nk]C[Well, the side is worth more than the center, but you can also aim to build strength here to later attack around M3.
--
is this good?];W[pi]
(;B[qj];W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[You must play the other direction here after having played N9 and S10.

first was my move to hold the corner right..i this it was... 2nd how should i play?? what joseki is best.]

(;B[qi];W[qg];B[ph];W[pg]
(;B[oh];W[nh];B[oi];W[kh]C[W has survived in the corner and broken into the center. Also this group is somewhat likely to live or escape now. I suggest aiming at this group to build points at the top, or focusing on the lower right.

TR[rg]C[No, and it would be hard to find one that is. He had one dead group and one weak group that are now one alive group. Since his corner also still lives, you did not gain much from this.

[sq][ar][rr][sr][as][qs][rs][ss]C[You won this game as a result of making some good early game decisions and keeping any center territory small while keeping your corners pretty large.

The biggest things from this game would have been separating the groups early on as I showed, and then avoiding the ko that occured at the top. Remember that weak groups are worth lots of points, so try to not let the opponent connect them for free, even if you have a big move to make.
