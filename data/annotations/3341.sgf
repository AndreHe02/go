GC[Game comment by Matthias Krings (sita@KGS)]

C[i belive i list the game due to the ko at S5 which led to the death of my group. I'd appreciate any comments on this and other sugestions.

MK: Comments to this game by Matthias Krings. In the main-branch they are preceeded with 'MK:', like this one

The ko is indeed the most interesting part to analyse. I hope my comments there get not too confusing, because they sometimes hope forward and backward in the game...]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[bf]C[MK: Overplay by white...]
;B[ec]C[MK: ...and a good answer. The move is big in itself and threatens to capture the corner.]
;W[ch]
(;B[be]LB[id:A]C[MK: But no need to capture it right now. The capture makes only some points (ok, quite many, but still only points). A move around 'A' might be more dynamic. See var.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[bd];B[bc];W[ae];B[bb];W[ef]TR[ch]C[W should take sente here. Together with the marked stone this shape is horribly overconcentrated.]
;B[fq]C[MK: Good: w has all of his stones played on the left, you control the board. The game is already very good for you.]
;W[nq];B[dn];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[do];B[dq];W[cq];B[jq]
LB[cr:A]C[MK: 'A' is sente and an absolut must, because it is enormous.

You may ask, why this move is so big, and taking the upper left corner was critisized as being to small. "Corner is corner", you might argue.

The difference is: The upper left corner were indeed only points, all surrounding stones had comparatively good shape (after b's extension), no matter what either side played there. But here, it is a matter of shape and eye space. If you play 'A', you make shape for your own stones, while limiting the eye-space of w. Look at the next move...]
;W[cr]C[MK: Now the w-group looks beautifull, and your stones are a bit cramped.]
;B[go];W[gn];B[oq];W[kq];B[jp];W[jr];B[ir];W[lr];B[np];W[mp]
;B[mo];W[no];B[op];W[lo];B[mn];W[mq];B[ln];W[ko];B[pj];W[pn]
;B[pl]C[Is this move wrong?

MK: Yes, capturing the cutting stone is usually bigger: It removes all the aji. After that, you have a really powerfull group which will give w a hard time. No way to hope that you might kill the invasion-stone, but you will surely build up even more influence somewehre on the right: Much better than killing!]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[qk];W[qo];B[qp]LB[rp:A]C[MK: 'A' seems better here.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[rn];B[sp];W[so];B[ro]C[Could I avoid the ko? Was this group killable? When did I make a mistake? Could I play the ko better?

This ko is perfekt for you: If you connect (like you do later), you have nothing to fear.]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[rp];B[sq];W[on];B[om]LB[nl:A]C[MK: Mh, looks like an empty triangle. ;-) 'A' instead seems to be the shape move. You can still be cut in two, but your left group has much better shape.]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[lm];W[ml];B[ll];W[mk]
(;B[po]LB[rl:A][qn:B]C[MK: To kill (which you should now), 'A' is better. The eye at 'B' is both, gote for w and not real unless he wins the ko: Nothing to fear here. See var.]

[ll][lm][ln][mn][mo]CR[lk][mk][ml][mm][ok]LB[sn:A]C[MK: Now the position gets difficult. In the position on the right there are 24 stones involved. That makes 48 points only "under" these stones plus some points of territory. Furthermore, if b wins the ko, the triangled stones are definitive alive, which makes the circled stones very weak. All in all, b will dominate much of the board. That means that there is definitly no ko threat on the board.

When you play a move like S5, you must prepare yourself to play 'A' in your next move, no matter what w plays in between.]
;W[gr]
(;B[fr]C[MK: Having said all that, this moves might be called the losing move. But it is not! The reason is that there is no ko on the right! Read on...

(In the variation you will find only a refernce showing that this threat isn't that big.)]
;W[rp];B[sm];W[sn];B[ro];W[ho];B[hp];W[rp]
(;B[sj]C[MK: Big mistake. W has an eye, so the most important thing you need now is an eye.]

;W[ps];B[ro];W[ip];B[qn];W[iq]C[MK: if you had ignored the first threat (asuming that there is a ko on the right), there would have been less damage done. See var. to move #99.]
;B[oo];W[nc];B[fl]TR[jm][kl]LB[lc:A]C[Is this too deep?

MK: Maybe this is the wrong question? First of all, it might be not deep enough, considering that the marked stones are exremly strong. Second, why not continue in the upper right, maybe with a pincer around m17. It is hard for w to secure as many territory on the left-half, compared to your prospects in the right-half.]

;W[il];B[jj];W[jk];B[kk];W[kj];B[ji]C[MK: The game is now almost won for you. W has maybe a little bit more definite territory than you have, but you have still an enormous potential.]
;W[ii]
(;B[ih]C[I think this was wrong. Which of the variations is better? Connecting or a sacrifice?]
;W[jh];B[ki];W[kh];B[li];W[lh];B[mi];W[ig];B[ij];W[qc]C[I think the game was already lost here.

MK: The game is very difficult to count, but I will try it nonetheless:

White:
LL: 70
UL: 10
UR: 10
-->90 points

Black:
LR: 50
UL: 20
--> 70 points.

Thus: b needs 20+ points somewhere in the upper right (either on the right or on the upper side): It seems to be a close game.]

[rn][sn][no][qo][so][rp]C[MK: It is very difficult to give some general comments to that game. You dominated the whole game, showing not many weaknesses. The ko in the lower-right was indeed the turning-point. You lost the lower-side-group *and* sente (w played o17). After that you had still a lead, but two big endgame mistakes (j12 and not playing p16) cost you the game.

Besides all the tactics around the ko there are two general things to learn from this game, I think.

The first is b15 (#11): There is no need to punish an opponents mistake right-away, by capturing something. If you see such a chance, keep calm and have a close look whether your oppent indeed might want to safe these stones. If not, play a big move somewhere else.

The other ones concern your handling of the ko-threats f2, etc. (Assuming for now that there really was a ko). If you have to ignore a big ko threat to win a ko (because you cannot afford to lose it), win it right away. Answering ko-threats make the situation typically worse.]
