C[S> Hello, this is Scartol (eric@etan.org). All of my comments will have this S> symbol before them.]
;B[dp]C[Dear Sir,
I looking for your help in review white stone. Especial in the fuseki reaction, and joseki reaction, and the order of react to the game situation.
Thank you.
--
S> Black obviously makes a big center territory, which is a problem. It's important to spread out your stones more and keep him from solidifying his walls so much. Also, in a number of spots, you defend when you don't have to.]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[oq]LB[op:A][pn:B]C[Q: am I block in the right timing?
Q: am I block in the right way, or I should take D16 or block at O4?
--
S> This is too early, and doesn't work well with the Q16 stone. I would play D16 because I like to grab corners quickly. If you really want to attack, play at A or B.]
;B[dd];W[cf];B[ch];W[cc]C[Q: am I go into 3.3 is the best move according to the current fuseki situation. I plan to take territory is the right?
--
S> Taking the corner is a guarantee of some territory. But remember that it gives black a big wall, and it's important to keep him from using that wall to make a big center territory.]
;B[dc]LB[cd:A]C[S> An odd move by black. A is more common.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fc];W[ce];B[jd];W[lc];B[ck]
;W[jp]LB[fq:A]C[S> Approaching the corner at A works on a larger scale -- this move feels timid and lets black respond leisurely.]
;B[kc]LB[ld:A][dg:B]C[S> This almost always requires a response from white at A. Otherwise, black gets to play there and makes a lovely shape toward the center -- and remember, the wall on the left means white NEEDS to get into the middle.
--
S> Note also that B is a very big move at this time, for the same reason.]
;W[fq]C[S> Good.];B[fp];W[cq]LB[gp:A]C[S> Unusual. A is better and much more common.]
;B[cp]LB[dq:A]C[S> Also odd. I can't think of a single good reason for black to play anywhere other than A.]
;W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[bp]LB[gq:A]C[S> This is a yose move. Play A instead.]
;B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[dr];B[eh]LB[dg:A][el:B]C[S> Now White A is useless. Black has made it very difficult for white to move into that territory on the left side. A reducing move around B is now very important.]
;W[qr]C[Q: if I take S3 (3.3) in here is make sense? or I should place the stone else where?
--
S> Well, R3 is the (3,3) spot, but there's no need to play that closely. The problem with this move is that it allows black to extend upward. That black stone is weak -- so approach from above and force him to run (into the center or the corner), then use the sente to build a framework on the right side.]
;B[qm];W[pj]LB[qj:A]C[S> A is better, since it stops the slide at S10.]
;B[rj];W[qh];B[qc];W[pc]LB[ld:A]C[S> When you block in this direction, make sure you use the action to form a moyo in that direction. Notice that having a stone at A would be really helpful now.]
;B[qd];W[qe];B[re];W[pe];B[rf];W[qf]LB[qg:A]C[S> A very, very slow move. A is better.]
;B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[oc];B[ld];W[rg]LB[mc:A]C[S> I'd be inclined to play A and save the white stone. It doesn't look like you can kill that black corner.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[np];W[nq];B[rq];W[qq];B[op];W[pp]LB[lp:A]C[S> This is a gote move. A is closer to sente.]
;B[po];W[pq];B[qo]LB[jj:A][hg:B][fl:C]C[S> Before white moves, look at the board -- where is the danger? White has three corners which are pretty small. The top-right white group isn't alive yet, but it's very close. It is absolutely urgent to get into that black middle aread before he can solidify it any further. A is the most timid way to reduce, but it is almost certainly not enough. You'll have to take more of a risk with B or C.]
;W[bh];B[bi];W[bg];B[gq];W[fr];B[hp]C[S> Ouch. Black has now cut white's bottom apart while making more of his own wall.]
;W[ir]LB[jn:A]C[S> Slow. Never mind connecting -- get out into the middle! A is a good way to start (but again, it's probably too little too late)]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[lq];W[lr];B[lp];W[mr]LB[jq:A]C[S> A is a much better move. At this point, black can play at A and capture one of those white stones -- again, hurting white while building his own wall.]
;B[ml];W[jr]C[S> Small. Break out into the middle.];B[jo];W[iq]
;B[ip];W[jq]C[S> There is absolutely no reason to save this stone.]
;B[hi];W[gr];B[mc];W[pa];B[qa];W[oa];B[sd];W[hq];B[gp];W[ea]
;B[fa];W[da];B[mi]C[S> At this point, the game is more or less over. White cannot possible break into black's huge (and well guarded) territory, and living inside is almost unthinkable. I will end my comments here.
--
S> You have a good playing style, but make sure you spread out more and take those big points when you can!
