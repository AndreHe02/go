C[I looked at the game very fast. Your game did not have a consistent strategy. First you played high and build a big moyo but then went for the corners. Also you can improve on the tactical level. There were some plays that were difficult to understand and you let white live on territory that was secured. Keep practicing and do not play fast games! think!

;W[nd];B[oc]C[p17 is not consistent with the previous plays that go for outside influence. YOU might play p15, o15 or o17.
In truth the secuences would be compilcated, but if you want to play simpler you should have played o16 instead of p10. Another possiblity is to play tenuki on m16 or m17 first.]
;W[nc];B[qe];W[od];B[ob]C[r17 would let the group live];W[pe]
;B[qd];W[nb];B[na]C[should be r18 here];W[ma];B[oa];W[pc];B[pb]
;W[qc];B[mb];W[qb]C[s17 is probably better for white to reduce the aji of the three whte stones and to keep n19 as a possible ko treat.]
;B[la];W[rd]C[white should have kept the presure on the black group by playing on the outside around l17]
;B[jc];W[gc];B[mc];W[dj];B[cl];W[cn];B[el];W[gq];B[cq]C[c3 is alright but i would have played around d14 or c14 first and keep c3 for later on the game]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr]C[better to play b4 so not to help white to build strength.
However the whole secuence of taking the corner is maybe out of rythm with the previous plays.
I would have attacked d10 with a play around d13 or d14 before going for the corner]
;W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[gr]C[a2 makes life. g2 helps white to extend his wall]
;W[hr]C[white should have played h3 to make his wall thicker and start a base to attack the black moyo]
;B[hs]C[why not h3?];W[ir];B[is];W[js]C[again white should play k2 instead. j2 is more than a wasted move a self damaging one.]
;B[gs];W[jq];B[mo]C[n4 is alright but too mild for my taste. need to play around d14 first. n4 helps white to weaken the stones at c8 and e8 by attacking the black moyo.]
;W[cg]C[c14 is a weak move c10 or f10 would be better.];B[cc]
C[c17 helps white to consolidate his moyo, Very poor move!]

;B[dg];W[ch];B[ac];W[ab]C[pointless move by white!];B[ad]C[why? what´s wrong with a19? You're giving away 2 ko treats]
