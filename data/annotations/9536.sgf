C[Hello, dear Reviewer!

I am Bernd, a 2d from Germany, HonFu in the GTL and other go places.

This was a game on KGS. I tried to play a controlled counting game from the start; but there were complications anyway (as usual). I lost by 0,5 in the end (my opponent had no komi), but there must have been mistakes. Especially happy I would be if there was any fundamental stuff amiss (because that would mean that there are still other ways to improve for me except doing three hours of life and death problems daily. ^_Â°) Please, if you can, review toward the very end (because it was such a close matter).

I have added my thoughts about the game in the file.

Thank you!

forfun (hereafter ff) - Hi Bernd! Thanks for providing an excellent game for this review. There were any number of interesting points. However, when you asked to concentrate on the last part you really made it a great review. I got caught up in going backward through the game, looking for last chances. :-)

If I could point to some key points to take away from this game:
1. I think that Black has to be careful about playing too passively. Maybe this comes from the mindset of facing a "stronger" player, but you were too willing to be pushed around IMHO. On the other hand, since the game was lost by the smallest possible margin and Black had various chances to win right up to the end...

2. Black badly misjudged the size of the big ko that occurred on the left side. As pointed out in the comments, I think Black would have had an easy win by giving up the ko and capturing the top. Black needs to be careful and calm in judging these kind of exchanges. All of us require a little extra push in order to calmly comtemplate sacrificing large groups when the position demands it.

3. IMHO it is not until Black 249 that the game was actually lost. Keep looking for every small advantage!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[cc];B[oq];W[qj];B[qf]C[ff - This is a very unusual play at the professional level. Black will always go futher to R12 or R13. However, with the upper left a 3-3 stone, Black is much more likely to play from the lower right at R8 than from the upper right as here.]
;W[qm]C[ff - This erases Black's shimari without leaving any good follow-up for Black.]

(;B[oc]TR[cc]C[Hon: This move is not seen a lot; my idea was 1.) to steer the game away from complications from the start; 2.) to develop away from the marked stone, because the upper side is not so important.

This way of playing looked possible to me; at least in a no-komi game it should be okay (but what do you think?).

ff - This looks too conservative. There is a degree of negative thinking that Black should resist. Black should turn to the upper right instead IMHO...]
;W[mq]TR[qm]C[Hon: Of this move I am never sure when it is an overplay and when it's not.

Is this approach (at this point in time) good? And how do I counter it?

ff - It looks too early. That does not mean, however, that it is easy to "punish" this move. If Black has to reply defensively then this is not an overplay, which in turn would mean that P17 must be a mistake(!).]

(;B[oo]C[Hon: I chose the safe way, again relying on solidity.

If he extend, I get the next fuseki move, and point-wise I didn't see myself behind.

Anyway, from a "normal" point of view, this move feels slackish to me ...

ff - Black has allowed himself to be forced here. I see this as a logical, and poor, continuation of the thinking behind P17. Black is playing with too defensive a mindset.

First lets ask, "When is P5 OK"? It can only be when Black can use P5 *after* White's next move. Since White will inevitably play next on the bottom side, P5 is only good when Black has a good attacking move on the right as a follow up. However, here the earlier play at R14 was too conservative so there are not interesting (i.e. threatening) moves against the two stones on the right.

So what should Black's plan be? Here the bottom is wide open. White has approached right up to Black's shimari without any backup close by. So pincer!.

It is worth noting that if we look only at the shape in the bottom right corner (shimari with 2-space extension in front and then an approach to N3) by far the most common reply to this White approach in professional play is to tenuki! In over 50% of the 100+ professional games where we see the approach, Black does not respond immediately. There is no example where White immediatedly invades the Black shimari next. Black is not shut in so an immediate invasion will always strengthen Black toward the outside, leading to an attack on some of the surrounding stones. Having said that, see the variations for how to reply locally anyway...]
;W[mo]
(;B[fq]TR[iq]C[Hon: Instead of this move, I thought about the marked spot; but I was not sure if it's wise to create a weak group now. A fight seems to help White more on the left side, than I can profit on the right.

ff - This move allows the pincer, which looks like it works too well with the two stones to the right. See the variations...]
;W[hq]TR[cq]C[Hon: Probably the normal thing would be to enter the corner now, but I didn't like gote. ^^]
;B[cn]C[Hon: So I came here instead to try something else, but I think, that might have been too much, since White has more support here and can risk a fight.

ff - This is a light idea. It should not turn out to be "too much" unless you are thinking of saving everything. This move naturally expects to sacrifice F3.]
;W[cp]C[Hon: And he does.]
(;B[hp]C[ff - This move can easily turn out to be a mistake (as in the game). It should not be Black's first thought here.]
;W[iq]C[ff - This greatly strengthens White's position on the bottom side.]
;B[eo]C[Hon: I  tried some make-do getaway with the purpose to get settled here and have already reduced his influence at the bottom.

ff - You are giving White too much credit on the bottom. That is not influence - it is a target! Do not help it get stronger.]
;W[dr]
(;B[er]TR[fn]C[Hon: I considered the marked spot instead, but it felt just a bit too slack to be genuinely honte ... (I get this feeling a lot. '^^)

So I wanted to at least force him here first and prevent the connection ...

ff - Well it did not work. Black is way "over-thinkiing" here. Remember, in the early part of the game, it is almost always a good thing if the opponent connects along the 2nd line. Here, Black H4 has already strengthened White to the right, so F6 is by far the better play.

Also note that Black has been forced here. When White ignores E2 the position becomes the same as if Black played E2 and White replied with D2. However, Black would never play E2! Given the chance, Black would slide in to D2 instead.]
;W[dn]C[Hon: He doesn't wait any longer, though, and opens fire directly.]
;B[do];W[co];B[dm]TR[cm]C[Hon: I thought about extending on the marked spot instead, but then I am cut, and it might have long-term consequences. So I took the offer for a ladder, knowing that he would push through.]
;W[ep];B[en];W[fp]TR[cl]C[Hon: I thought, that losing the two stones down there would be acceptable if I get some thickness and the first move on the left side.

But just looking at the local situation, it doesn't look so good to me after all. My "thickness" still has the marked weak point, which harms any potential I might want to create on the side; and White, having spent one more move, has 25 points in the bank.

ff - Your second look was better. Black's capturing shape is not efficient due to the extra stone at E5. Meanwhile E2 is a dead loss - Black passed once! Also H4 looks even worse. If the H4/J3 exchange had not happened, Black could look at playing J3 later together with L3 to rather easily reduce White's bottom side.]
;B[df]
(;W[ch]C[Hon: My opponent was stingy, though, and pincered rightaway.

I felt that this gives my "thickness" a meaning - if I find a good way to cut, that is.

ff - As you yourself analyzed earlier, there is still the weak point at C8 so it is not likely that Black can trap White here. Black should be interested in letting White connect (again on the second line) in order to build a Black position on the top.

Throughout this game White keeps trying to confront Black.]
;B[ec]C[Hon: I had a double-purpose in mind here. If White goes for some connection now, it might help my top (which could turn quite big in combination with my shimari), and if he spoils the top, I can separate him in the upper left more effectively.]

(;W[bf]C[Hon: I did not see a way to make convincing thickness in sente here.]

(;B[be]C[Hon: So I go for the cut instead.

ff - Black cuts a stone (C12) that he can not capture from a group C17 that is alive. Fundamentally, this cut can not be very valuable for Black.]
;W[ce];B[cf];W[bd];B[bg];W[ae];B[cg]C[Hon: He went for the corner, accepting the cut.

On the one hand he is cut, alright; on the other hand, my shape is not so hot.

ff - The point is not only is your shape not so hot, but Black has not carried out the strategic plan to close off the top!!! This is actually a poor result for Black.]
;W[bh]
(;B[ag];W[cl]
(;B[bm]C[ff - This is a good move if Black can seriously think about capturing White here.]
;W[eh]C[Hon: I found this situation hard to handle. I want to get ahead in the fight, but I have to watch my own shape and that thin spot, too.

ff - Realize that Black has tried to do too much, time after time. Black has forced White to become strong in the bottom side and in the upper left. As a result, White only has one weak group and Black has various thin shapes.]

(;B[eg]C[ff - Poor shape, Black pushes White from behind.];W[fh]
;B[gf]C[Hon: I went with this, although it is kind of awkward shape, leaving weakness in my position and helping my opponent's. Anyway, I didn't find anything better, and this looked like it might help me develop the top.]

(;W[jc]C[Hon: Which he spoils rightaway.];B[hc];W[mc];B[db]
;W[cb];B[hh]C[Hon: After some exchanges I went for the cap, which so often is a crucial strategic point ...

ff - Good, although White has spoiled Black's framework, there are several thin White groups lying around. Black wants the strategic "high ground"]
;W[fj];B[hj];W[gk]C[Hon: But in this whole maneuver (aiming at the top), my lower left group got compromised. Being a bit out-of-shape with my reading, I overestimated the "liveability" of this group.]
;B[hk];W[gm];B[gl];W[fl];B[hl];W[fm];B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[bj]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[ap];W[aq];B[ao];W[cm]C[Hon: I think, he could have killed me here.]
;B[bq];W[bn];B[an];W[br];B[ar];W[cq];B[dh]
(;W[di];B[cj];W[dj];B[aj];W[ci];B[ah]C[Hon: I made the 2/3 connection at the edge; he will make good use of the ko there.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[rg]
(;B[rf];W[ro];B[rp];W[nb];B[ob];W[ib];B[hb];W[nr];B[or]C[Hon: I think, I maybe answered too much with all these endgames (if so, what else?); but I thought, that if he doesn't make proper shape at the top, it might do him harm later. (So in a way, I thought this was too early for endgame and it was okay to let him strengthen me.)

ff - This is a terrible sequence! If it were used in a book on the endgame, everyone would criticize the author for putting in such an unrealistic diagram! :-)]
;W[qg];B[pg]
(;W[ph];B[oh];W[qh];B[lb]C[Hon: So here I come.

ff - This whole sequence is very nicely done. Like C10 on the left side, you were reading more deeply than your ("stronger") opponent. But realize that you were lucky to get the chance to play this. :-)]
;W[mb];B[kb];W[jb];B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[kc];B[og]TR[kd][ld]C[Hon: I wanted to capture him on the largest possible scale.]
;W[md];B[lf];W[jd];B[kf];W[ka];B[ia];W[na];B[la];W[ai]C[Hon: I think, he played it cleverly. If I don't kill the upper group, I will take harm in the upper right; so now he starts the huge ko fight.]
;B[bi];W[le];B[ke];W[ai];B[bs];W[cr];B[bi];W[ma]TR[ka][na][ib]
[jb][mb][nb][jc][kc][lc][mc][jd][md][le][bi][aj][bk][bl][bm]
[dm][an][cn][en][ao][bo][do][eo][ap]C[Hon: At this point, I gave up the idea to win the ko-fight, because my group is just bigger, and I don't see enough moves to threaten life.

ff - This does not look like the right decision. The bottom left group of stones was not really bigger than the top side. Remember that A3 is still a ko so you half "lose" it in the big ko. So only the marked stones are involved in each group. More importantly, the top is much more open than the left side.]

(;B[cj];W[lb]C[Hon: So we both lived (sigh), but at least I got sente to build up the center potential.]
;B[gn]C[Hon: Since he is not alive himself, I thought I could split him; if he really accepts that offer, he might get into trouble with my center thickness.]

(;W[gp];B[hm];W[fn];B[fo];W[go];B[hn];W[em];B[dn];W[dl];B[bn]
;W[ek]C[Hon: This worked just as I planned (but necessarily?); now I got sente again and can try further to increase the center.]
;B[ho]C[Hon: I thought this was sente, too, but that seems to have been another misread.]
;W[kp];B[gq];W[eq];B[gr];W[fs];B[ds];W[es];B[gs];W[cs]C[Hon: So ... what would be the way to increase the center to the max?]
;B[nl]C[Hon: I went with this one.

ff - This looks as reasonable as any other. The center is too wide open to say what will be the very best.]
;W[lm];B[jp];W[jq];B[lk];W[oi];B[ni];W[oj]
(;B[oa]C[Hon: This felt so big. Was it big enough already to play it in reverse sente?

ff - This is worth about 7 points but it also affects the potential in the center and along the right edge. In any case I would not blame Black's loss on this play.]

(;B[mm];W[ln];B[ll];W[jm]C[Hon: I think, this was not the best local result for me.

The rest is small endgame. Would there still have been a way to be on the better side of that 0,5?]
;B[ip]C[ff - This and the sequence in the upper left are nice reading by Black.]
;W[kq];B[bb];W[bc];B[aa];W[af];B[pk];W[qk]
(;B[qo]C[ff - But I think this is questionable...];W[jk]C[ff - This is definitely sente, so quite big. Now the game is very close.]
;B[jj];W[nf];B[ie]C[ff - This is quite a clever answer to the threat of O12. It is not clear to me that leaving the center thin at O11 is best. Black might be better off to simply connect at O12. However, I could not prove it in my variations, so we will let this move stand. :-)]
;W[nh];B[oe];W[rn]C[ff - Should White have played O10 first?]

;W[ik];B[ij];W[np];B[op];W[no]C[ff - Notice that this makes a point at N4 while preventing Black from connecting, which means Black has to fill in at M11 at the end of the game. This is White's winning margin!]

(;B[fd];W[df];B[jc]C[ff - Is this objectively better? Probably hard to say. However, it shows more spirit. Often the greatest danger in facing a stronger player is that we convince ourselves that our opponent is, in fact, stronger. It is normally a better strategy to make them prove it! :-)]
