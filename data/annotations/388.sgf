[ef];B[fd]C[White doesn't usually combine his next two moves, but I'm n
ot sure why not. Playing the shoulder hit at D11 immediately is joseki, and black first response in that case is to stop the corner invasion.]

(;W[bd]C[Black may  not need to answer this in the usual way, but I'm not sure what would be better.]
;B[cc];W[di]C[The peep at D13 only serves to strengthen white. The usual sequence beginning with C11 seems to work here.]

(;B[dg];W[df];B[eg];W[fg];B[fh]
(;W[ei]C[White's last (
18) looks heavy. The cut one point higher is the way to attack this group.]

(;B[eh];W[cg]C[Black's move here makes his stones heavy and subject to attack.
G12 moves out, and is one alternative; there are others.]
(;B[dh]C[The shape of black's stones here should be instinctively avoided.]
;W[ci];B[bh]C[Whiite repays the favor by allowing his group to become weak. He needs to make e
ye space at B17 or move out with a move like G14.]
(;W[bg];B[ff]
(;W[fe];B[gg]C[Now that escape is difficult, making eye space at B17 is particularly urgent.]

(;W[ed];B[ec];W[ee];B[ge];W[cd]C[Black's next move is a big mistake. Strategically, it makes sense, taking a big open point, but this is the wrong time to leave the upper left! White captures black stones, and takes the corner. B17 is sente (white must respond) bec
ause it threatens B15, which kills the white group. Since it is sente, it can be played at once, it also makes territory in the corner in addition to defending.]

(;B[pj];W[fc]C[This cut is a big loss for black.];B[gd];W[eb];B[dc];W[gc]
C[Black's last chance to live is probably D18, but it's complicated, and not as nice as having played B17 earlier. The variations that follow are just me playing around with some possibilities.]

(;B[hc];W[hb]C[This situation calls for the "double hane" of J18. Even though the corner is lost, black can get a lot of influence.]

(;B[ic];W[db];B[qn];W[np];B[rp];W[qq]LB[iq:A][ip:B][jp:C][jq:D]C[Black's priorities should be to  finalize his very large territorial framework on the upper right and to take some territory on the lower side. The first goal could be attempted by P6 or P7 (outlining the territory) or O16 (securing the territory).  The latter goal (taking some territory at the bottom)
 could be attempted by J3, J4, K3 or K4.]
(;B[ep]C[Black's move is too high to secure territory. Outlining territory in "outer space" is inefficient.]
;W[dq]
(;B[hp];W[kq]C[Compare wh
ite's last few moves with blacks. White has secured real claims to territory on the lower right and in the lower left corner, while black's position is open.]
;B[do];W[co];B[dn];W[hq];B[gq];W[iq];B[ip]C[White gives black a chance by trying too hard to protect the lower side.]

(;W[fq];B[fp];W[gr];B[gp];W[fr];B[cm]C[That sequence was effective for black. Although white has solidified the terr
itory I mentioned in my earlier comment, black has set up influence towards the center. As successfull as it was, there is still not as much profit as could have been made by securing the upper right. However, given the sequence played, black should have  gone all out to kill white's stones on the 11th line.]
;W[cl]C[Cutting white's four stones off by descending to B7 is a more aggressive way to play.]

(;B[dl];W[ck]C[Last chance! I think that B7 would still kill.]
(;B[dk];W[bm];B[pc]
(;W[pg]C[This invasion is very far from any help, and on the fourth line. Black can afford to take the eye space from underneath rather than capping. Again, white may live, but should be forced to live small. In the a
ctual game, he gauges out a lot of territory!]
(;B[ng];W[qe];B[qd];W[pe];B[oe];W[of];B[nf];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[oj];W[oi]
;B[ni];W[on]C[This move gives white influence affecting blacks territorial framework.  It is big, and black should have seized it earlier.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[pl];W[ko];B[jo]C[In the coming pushing race, white gains as much a
s black. Trying to seal off the upper framework is a greater priority.]

(;W[jn]
(;B[in];W[jp];B[io];W[jm];B[im];W[jk];B[ik];W[gj];B[jl];W[kl];B[il];W[jj]
;B[ij];W[lk]C[I don't understand this move (black's next - o10). Since both of black's groups affected by a cut at O10 are alive, there is no need to connect. It is more important to secure the moyo at top. In any case, the final boundaries are essentially set, and black is already lost.]

(;B[nj]C[I don't understand this either. White should gauge out territory at the top.]

(;W[nk];B[li];W[ek];B[el];W[fk];B[fi]C[White's next is either a big mistake or bravado. It is possible that he just wanted to see if he could live inside (he fails, but wins anyway).]
;W[gl];B[ej];W[dj];B[fj];W[hi]C[Black should make eye space for
 his group, or connect it to his other groups. White is not really threatening to live, but there is a  threat of black getting into a possibly losing capturing race.]

(;B[hh];W[ii];B[ji];W[jh];B[ki];W[ih]C[It is best to play a little further away in a fight like this. If white lives, he will gain more territory. By playing around b you draw a line you can actually hold. By playing at a, you do not retain white, note that he eventually extends even beyond b.]

(;B[ig];W[kg];B[lg];W[kf];B[jg];W[kh];B[lh];W[le];B[ld];W[kd];B[kc];W[ke]
;B[md];W[fm]C[Now, black's group will have trouble
 making life, and white will be able to gain from the capturing race.]
(;B[fn];W[em];B[dm];W[en];B[fl];W[gk];B[eo];W[gm];B[gn]C[If white plays H7, black's group cannot make two eyes, and will only live by killing white's group first. This will allow white to gain territory on the outside. Bearing in mind that black will eventually win, but must go through the race, you will realize that he can be forced to fill what will be his own territory, while white fills dame points.]

(;W[qo];B[ro];W[rq];B[hm]C[Good.];W[pn];B[rm];W[rd];B[rc];W[re]C[Black should have been aware that the situation in the upper  right is risky for him. There are a number of ways of securing that corner.]

(;B[oh];W[og];B[ph];W[qh];B[nh];W[qf];B[ri];W[rh];B[si];W[sh];B[rk];W[od]
C[After a cut like this, it is a good idea to read things out. Playing at P16 leads to a lesser loss. However, black has one more chance to save his group.]

(;B[ne];W[oc]C[I think that b lives after Q18.]
(;B[ob];W[pb];B[qc];W[nb];B[nc];W[oa]C[There are some other options, but black will lose this corner, too.]

(;B[nd];W[ob];B[mb];W[qb]
(;B[ib];W[gb];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[bl];B[ag];W[af];B[ah];W[ma]C[This is a mistake, white must secure his upper left corner.]
;B[lb];W[rb];B[la]C[

A better way to exploit the weakness where you did play was to play the sequence beginning with L7.]

ath" by Davies). I was 23k* about a year ago and these books were very helpful to me.]
