AB[dp][pd]PL[B];W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[qi];W[of];B[nd];W[mf]C[Hi,
First of all, sorry for the late review.
It has been a very heavy week and I forgot to inform Arno
about a possible delay. than there was an 8 day holiday
from which I came back this morning at 7am.

Now for the review...
Since W stones were put in a pincer, the third extension
-the move you have just played- does not help you in  establishing a base for your stones. You have to create some
eye space for your stones by playing near the side, not
extending towards the center...];B[ld];W[kf]C[As you see you are helping B to gain a lot of territory on top,
without gaining anything...];B[jd];W[if];B[qm]LB[qk:a]C[B move would i guess be better one up.  This invites an attack at 'a'.]
;W[np];B[om]C[Now B is strong there.  As well as on top...
Your 5 stones are in danger....];W[mn]LB[rd:a][ph:b][pi:c]C[This move is played too quickly.
There are a lot of points you should first play.
Remember,
First Corner, then Sides, then Center....

As I said before, your stones need a base.
You should immediately play some of the shown moves...];B[ml]
;W[fp];B[fq]
(;W[ep]LB[gq:a]C['a' is the answer to B move...];B[eq];W[eo]
C[This move not to be played.
Just a shape called empty triangle, means you have played sth
wrong. In our case, problem starts from the previous move....

There is a simple joseki there. I have shown in the previous move...]
;B[do];W[dn];B[cn];W[dm];B[cm]LB[en:a][gp:b][dl:c]C[B has the corner.
Your stones are not as effective and there are cutting points...]
;W[cl];B[bl]
(;W[ck]C[Both B and W thinks two stones side by side are enough to be secure.
But it is not....
If I were B,....];B[bk]
(;W[co]C[I have played a few variations,
but could not find a successful attack.
There may be. but i could not find...];B[bo]

;W[cj]TR[ml]LB[dl:a][en:b][gp:c][el:d][fn:e]C[This may be a correct move but considering the
N8 B stone which is out to the center, B can play
cutting stones at a, b, c and link his cutting stones to N8.

If he succedes W's wall will be destroyed...
W need a move like d or e.];B[dg]LB[cg:a]C['a' better for B.]
;W[hd]C[The aim is questionable....
You could invade the corner at 3-3.];B[fd];W[hc];B[gf];W[he]
;B[hf];W[ie];B[hh];W[ge]C[gives you nothing.

;W[hk];B[ij];W[ik];B[jj];W[hg];B[gg];W[ih];B[ii]C[B is very strong now...
You have two eye spaces, one on top, one on side.
But you still did not use them...];W[ji];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj]LB[ki:a]
C[better at 'a'.];W[ki];B[ll]LB[li:a][pg:b][re:c][qq:d][gp:e]
C[B did not need to link.  B could easily attack you at the marked points...]
;W[km]C[this move cannot cut B
Are you trying to make territory with this stone and
you wall?? Well, that may be possible.  But wall are generally not used to make territory,
You generally push you opponent to your wall(where you are strong)
and kill him OR let him live with a very little territory....
But since your wall is not that strong, this would not be so easy
in this case....];B[kl];W[jl];B[li];W[lh];B[mh];W[mi];B[lj]
;W[nh]C[you had to defend in this move....
the consequences were not good...];B[kh];W[jh];B[lg];W[mg];B[lh]
;W[lf];B[ni];W[mj]C[no escape...];B[nj];W[lm];B[oh];W[je];B[kd]
;W[ng]C[you are after very small points.
The bottom is still not yours. An invasion there will most
likely be successful...  Your corner at bottom right is still open.
Most important, you still have not made eyes for your stones up there.]
;B[rd]C[Will cause big problems....];W[ne];B[oe];W[pe];B[od]
;W[og];B[qe];W[me]C[First eye :)];B[md];W[kg]C[and the second...
But it cost you much. B has all the top right....];B[pf];W[pg]
;B[pe];W[rf];B[re];W[se]LB[qh:a]C[leading you to a loss.

;W[qk];B[rl];W[pl];B[pm]C[B has nothing to fear.

and a little more to the middle.... (not center, to the right i mean)]
;W[iq];B[gp]C[your two moves are supporting 2 different aims
OR don't they?
I guessed the first move was an invasion to the bottom.
But i guess now, it was just a fake move to not immediately put THIS
B stone in atari....];W[hq];B[en];W[fo];B[fn];W[go]C[here is a solution.,..]

(;B[hp];W[ip];B[ho];W[gn]C[this style made 2 week group of stones.

KO[];B[le]C[The result is not shown.
But B was well ahead....

Remember to follow the importance of corner, sides, center...
Always establish base for your stones to live.
Make walls not for territory but to push your opponent there....

Some basic joseki is helpful in the beginning.
You generally play in a way, that results in a cut.... Avoid that.
If you are split into two, think it as if you are half as strong...

I would welcome any questions, I will try to answer them quickly.
Again, sorry for the late reply....])
