Although white resigned this game, he won.  I guess he was just tired
and wanted to go to bed, and I kindof wanted to see it to the end.
 I didn't realize I was behind that much, I guess.

Anyway, thank you for taking the time to review this game.

It was between shiratori 19k* (white) and me, asobu 26k* (black), played on IGS]

asobu: a pincer seemed right, but I wasn't sure on the best distance.  'A'
seemed the safest, but the point I played seemed like the most effective.
'B" seemed like a wishy-washy move, not very strong but still easily
invadable later.

GioVAX: Of the 3 moves in exam, this is IMHO the most severe  pincer: it's true that W can invade between the B stones, but the W marked stone is weak.]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[GioVAX: Correct side. The moyo on the right side is wider.]

;W[rc];B[qf];W[nq];B[pn]LB[np:a]C[
asobu:Would a pincer here have been better?  I didn't really feel too
 confident playing too many pincers on someone so much stronger than me.

GioVAX: A pincer would make W jump out driving him right in your moyo; another possibility is 'A' (see variation)]

asobu:I decided the best bet might be to take the center, even
though I knew it would be a hard game ahead.  It was probably a mistake.

GioVAX: In this position I fear W 'A'; maybe a better approach for B would be 'B']
;W[de]C[GioVAX: W helps B's plan to go for the center.];B[ed]
;W[ec];B[fc]LB[ge:a][gd:b]C[GioVAX: B shape needs another stone at 'a'; this could be better played at 'b'.]
;W[dc];B[df];W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ch]C[asobu:I felt lucky that I could push him down to the third line]
;B[ji]LB[fd:a][ef:b]C[asobu:I just hoped I could do something with it

GioVAX: Only problem is the bad aji of cuts at 'a' and 'b'.]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[id];B[gd]LB[ff:a]C[GioVAX: Odd shape, isn't it? Simpler and safer at 'a'.]
;W[ic];B[lb]C[GioVAX: This move is wasted: it doesn't threaten the corner group, and W couldn't connect anyway.]
;W[hf];B[hh];W[jf];B[ke]LB[kg:a]TR[lb][lc][ld][md][nd]C[asobu:I'm sure I could have pushed harder here.  I was just afraid
of the difference in strengths.

GioVAX: Based only on the shape, I would play 'a': the marked group is rock solid.]
;W[kf];B[lf]TR[ji][hh]C[GioVAX: Now the triangled stones  are startig to look thin.]
;W[jh];B[kh];W[kg];B[lh];W[ih];B[ii];W[hg];B[gh]LB[ig:a]C[GioVAX: You should reduce W to one eye with 'a' first.]
;W[je];B[lg];W[kd];B[le]TR[ke]LB[kc:a]C[GioVAX: Again, this is wasted: block W at 'a': the triangled stone, even if captured will never be an eye.]
;W[kc];B[ff];W[he]LB[fk:a]C[GioVAX: This is unnecessary, W is already alive. Better played at 'a'.]
;B[no]C[asobu:But there still seemed to be a lot of center left, so I trudged on.]
;W[cq]C[GioVAX: Slow, but since W is ahead, he can afford it.]
;B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[lq];B[oq];W[or];B[hp];W[ql]C[GioVAX: That's pretty deep.... maybe too much.]
;B[pl]LB[qm:a]C[GioVAX: If B is to win this game, it should try to kill this invasion, starting with 'a' that also gives B's group a base on the side.]

C[GioVAX: Misses the key point...];W[si]C[GioVAX: ... and W thanks for the opportunity.]
;B[qh];W[qj];B[kp];W[jp];B[jo];W[jq];B[ip]LB[io:a]C[GioVAX: When caught in this push battles, B should try to avoid creating this double cuts shapes; a good way could be 'a'.]
;W[jl];B[hl];W[im];B[hm];W[in];B[hn]LB[io:a]TR[ip]C[GioVAX: Now think to the triangled stone placed at 'a'.]

C[asobu:My lick with the center had been pretty bad, so I decided
 I'd better take some profit.  This might have lost me the game.

GioVAX: Life on the lower side for B seems quite difficult.]
;W[fo];B[dq];W[cp]LB[dr:a]C[GioVAX: W is well ahead, so he avoids  complications that could arise playing 'a': he is ready to give B a small life.]
;B[eq]LB[dr:a][eo:b]C[GioVAX: B seems to have suicidal istincts :)) Again this should be at 'a', as B will have to connect here anyhow when W will give atari at 'b'.]
;W[eo];B[cr];W[ll]C[GioVAX: And now W destroys the last B big area.]

GioVAX: Yep. a W move around 'a' will map abig territory, so B should do something for this.]
;W[el]C[GioVAX: Here it is...];B[di];W[hk];B[ej]LB[ci:a]C[GioVAX: If B wants to really damage W's territory, he should turn at 'a'.]

;W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[ge];W[gk];B[hj]LB[qr:a][oa:b]C[asobu:Now my lack of skill in the endgame becomes apparent.

GioVAX: Starting with this move B will leave W all the important points on the board and will answer every move played by W. Althoug behind, B at this point is not very far, and the game could still be recovered. For example 'a' on the lower side or 'b' on the upper side are much bigger than the actual move.]

GioVAX: I believe that considering the difference in strength between W and B and the missing handicap, this is a pretty good result for B. Maybe this is the reason behind W resignation.]
