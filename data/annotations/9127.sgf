C[Dear reviewer, insert your coments whereever you think it might be of help me i my quest for improvement.

Hi, my name is David and I am 9k on KGS. Sorry for my English, it is not my first language.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[dd];W[pq];B[jd];W[jq];B[dj];W[pj]C[Up to here all of black's moves are correct,  opening on one side and extending=perfect.]
;B[cm]CR[ep]C[I don't think this move is a very good one. White is allowed to make a move far better than black's. General rule is that when playing near a 3-4 point you attack it from the open direction, otherwise the corner territory becomes too big. (see next move)]

[hr][gr][fr][fs][gs][hs][is][jr][js]C[White makes near absolutly safe territory in the corner (crosses) and black's gain is much smaller(circles). White also makes the side very likely to become territory(squares). The difference is enourmous.]
;B[eo]C[I read somewhere that this can be a good attack on the shimari, though it does not seem to be the best move at this time.

This move is the good way to reduce enclosure's potential (and opponents teritory), but it is not an attack. An attack on this enclosure is near impossible. It is a good idea to prevent such enclosures from being made or make lots of points in exchange. Once on the board, a reduction is generally the best on can do (unless one can get a wall of sones very near).]
;W[qo];B[ip]CR[kp]C[I try a shoulder hit....
Q: Is this too far form Black E5?

I think the shoulder hit should have been from the other side. When the two walls are build like it happened in the game (black on the left and white on the right) white's gain (created territory) is bigger. But when black attacks from the circle point neither side creates territory and black's group can attack ther white's (more spaced out>more fragile than black's left side) right side and also the right part of the bottom side.]

C[I wanted to jump into White's zone of influence. The idea was to lpay safely far from the wall to have space enough.
Q: Was not it too deep? Could I have placed it better?

I think living here is unlikely. This stone is trapped between two rows of white stones and chances of getting to a side are minimal. It is one of the reasons the shoulder hit wasn't idealy played.]
;W[il]C[Here white is saying "I think I can kill you even if you play another stone there", which is probably true.]
;B[hl];W[iq]
(;B[hq]C[I wanted to separate the white group from the shimari in the corner.
Q: What about pulling back at H4?

This nor H4 works as a cut. G3 cuts it off but creates a complicated fight whuch I don't know the outcome of.]

C[Black wants to escape to safer parts, still trying to carve out twoo eyes.
Q: Is there a way for black to live at all? (My gutt feeling says yes, but I do not know how to achieve it.)

I think black's chances are not good, I cant find a single way to live (unless white makes a mistake :-)]

;W[mm];B[nm];W[mk];B[ml];W[lm];B[ll]C[The whole sequence from B53 to B67 is very clumsy.  Black seems to have room enough, bat can not manage to make two eyes.]

;W[ir];B[js];W[lq];B[kp];W[nc];B[qf];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qi]
C[This was too far from Black R14, as I saw in the post-game review. I think I wanted to slide under the white wall to connect.
Q: what would have been the best move? What alternatives I had in this position?

If a two point doesn't work, there is the one point jump. You also could extend to the left or attack the white stones at the top.]
;W[oc];B[ne];W[od];B[pe]C[Q: Was the too a timid move?

It is correct.];W[oe];B[nf]CR[of]C[Here black is letting white cut off the right side group. P14 would have prevented this.]

By T14 black dies as well.];W[rg];B[sf];W[rh];B[ri];W[sh];B[sk]
;W[rl];B[sl];W[rm];B[ok];W[ni];B[pl];W[ql];B[ls]C[Questionable, knowing white's strength. Covertly aims for the while L shape.]
;W[sg]C[If black played T13 than there was a chance for a seki if white missed the Q14.]

;B[ae];W[bc];B[fb];W[da];B[ms]C[Completes a futile plan.
Q: IS there a better move?

This attack was hopeless, two moves must have alerted white that something was going on.]
;W[or];B[mp]C[This is giving your opponent a free point and giving your turn up. This move does nothing good for you.]

;W[kd];B[ke];W[ih];B[ig];W[hg];B[hh]C[Q Is Black cereating his own weak group?

Yes, but he has to. White took all his other territory so black has to protect at least this one.]
;W[ii];B[gg];W[hf];B[if];W[gh];B[hi]C[Q: Can Black gain there anything?

He can try but it looks unlikely.];W[gi];B[gf]C[Q: Was Black F13 better?

I think this move is actually better because it kind of creates territory at the left of the 2 stones.]
