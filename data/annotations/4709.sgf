;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[po];W[mq]C[This doesnt put any presure on black, so i'd be tempted to play elsewhere (O17 for example), but R3 is fine as well]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[qk]TR[pl]C[This is a strange move, b can take the corner at S2, and can still makea base at R7, if you really want to put pressure on white delta is better, but N3 is too low to make this a really interesting attack, i'd just defend the corner instead]
;B[rr];W[pr]
(;B[iq]TR[kq]C[This move doesn't really do anything, take corner or put pressure, better at delta if you want to put pressure... But it seems better to make a base first, see variation]
;W[de];B[dh];W[fd]C[This is a bad move from white, certainly because the ladder doesn't work, but even if it works it's not good for w, see variation]

(;B[fe]C[Xhiggy: Looking back, maybe E12 was a better choice?

Balladeer: Definitly! it's the only move here!!];W[ch]C[Now w gets a lot of points and a solid group...]

(;B[di]C[Xhiggy: I hated the exchange of crawling on the 4th line as this greatly strengthened his group, but I didn't see an alternative. I suppose it all goes back to move 21?

Balladeer: Yes, but you don't have to move with this stone, you can also leave it, perhaps you'd want to play C11 later... see variation, moving this stone out like this just gives w a lot of points, and you don't get much of an influence]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[cl]C[W is happy to make so many points]
;B[em];W[oo]C[this seems wrong, better at C7, very big towards the corner, and makes it possible to go out]

(;B[nc]C[tenuki doesn't seem right, this is a very big point, but now w can make himself solid in the centre... see variation]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[qm];B[rn];W[pm]C[now white only has only 1 group left to look after, and your centre influence isn't doing anything anymore because white is so solid...]

(;B[pf]C[very big, but playing on the ride side is very big for black, in the game white gets a moyo on the right, see variation.]
;W[oe];B[qc];W[qd];B[pc];W[me]C[Now whites right moyo is very big, it is very open, but black cant make territory at the top with 1 move, and can't turn it into a moyo either anymore.]
;B[od]C[questionable here, it improves the black shape a lot, but also hurts the Q14 stone... But i don't see a good alternative for black]
;W[pe];B[jd]C[strange, see variation for white]
(;W[jc]C[strange, O16 is good enough];B[ic];W[kc];B[id];W[nd]
;B[mc]C[Xhiggy: I chose this move instead of P17 since I saw the WP17 - P 18 - Q18 - R18, etc. line and saw that my corner group could live quickly and the white group at the top would have to live in ko.

Balladeer: Good idea, playing at P17 would make it too easy for white]

;B[rd];W[re];B[od];W[jb];B[ka];W[oc];B[pj];W[md];B[nm]C[strange move, why peep on a cut? perhaps youd like to cut there later... better to just move out with the single stone]
;W[nn];B[mm];W[rs];B[sr];W[rm];B[ro];W[pp];B[sp];W[mi];B[nj]
;W[cq]C[this is huge];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[cn];B[do]
;W[bp];B[cm];W[bm];B[dn];W[bl]
(;B[dr]C[Xhiggy: I thought briefly about going to A6 instead, but I wasn't sure if I could kill the corner white group, and I urgently wanted to play C15, as I thought that was very big. of a move like M4, which was very big.

Balladeer: Wanting to take sente is ok, but with A6 you'd get this move too and white cant connect underneats (see variation)]
;W[an];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dl];B[el];W[ln];B[kk];W[jn];B[lp]
C[Xhiggy: In retrosepct, I think this should be at L4 (or somewhere else entirely)

Balladeer: somewhere else entirely seems best to me... T17 is big (sets up a peep at R14), someting like H6 is also big... tough to say whats best endgame here though
