C[Dakre: hi... you did experiment a lot in this game, what is a good thing to make progress... but sometimes i think you didn't read before you play a sequence and just try whether it works or not... this attitude can end a game very quickly ;) winning a game with 0.5 moku is just as good as by resignation ;)
so try to read whenever possible... this will train you a lot and your play will improve considerably, because afterwards i noticed that you knew a better move yourself to play... but during the game you probably where just to fast... ;)
hope the comment is helpful...];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd]C[Shusmacku [13k\]: hi
hungel [13k\]: hi];W[pq];B[po];W[oo]LB[jp:A]C[Dakre: this one is usually chosed when white has already a stone around A... it stresses the outside and lets black choose to take the corner]
;B[on];W[no];B[nn]LB[pm:A][pp:B]C[This looks funny to me.
Im thinking cut on q6 was the right way to go instead of what I did play.

Dakre: you're right, the cut looks promissing... N5 the move played therefore is not so good... black should have played whether A ord B to defend the cut]
;W[mo];B[pp]C[Now I played obviously with p-3.  Instead I was thinking of something along the lines of r11 and just give him the corner.

Dakre: the corner is not small and the side territory not either... p3 seems to be the only move... ;)]
;W[oq];B[pj]LB[cf:B][fp:A]C[Now I am finding it difficult to find an appropriate move.  K-4 looks tame.  I guess approaching on c-14 wouldn't have been bad either.

Dakre: A and B are two good alternatives, but your move is ok, too ;) K4 indeed would have been a bit tame, but makes good shape on the lower side... maybe j4 is even better balanced]
;W[jc];B[ld]C[very good move from my opponent.  Im feeling pressured.

Dakre: I don't think you should... white can easily live and has much space to the left]

(;W[ci]C[Dakre: you're leaving your stone alone where you felt pressured? ;) making a base like in the variation seems reasonable, but your move is ok, too, because it starts to build a moyo around the bottom left and works with your n5 stone]
;B[cg];W[cl];B[lm]LB[fc:A]C[Not really sure what to do for the last few moves or how to proceed.

Dakre: maybe A would have been an alternative]
(;W[lb];B[nc];W[gd];B[fc]LB[ec:A]C[I dont like this for black but it might be okay.  I guess he's attacking

Dakre: A would have been better for black... it defends the corner in almost sente... if white tenukies, black has good follow up moves]

(;W[lg]C[Dakre: you should block at G17... it is almost sente ;)]
;B[jd];W[mc]LB[ic:A]C[Dakre: maybe you should just try to keep the connection to the centre... then you don't have to worry about eyes... the black corner is still open and R17 would be a good move later for white...
and M13 is reducing the black moyo enough for my taste];B[md]
;W[nb];B[oc];W[pg]C[Dakre: this maybe a bit too deep considering your weak group at the top]
;B[qf]C[These shoulder hits look funny to me.  o-13 rather suggests itself.]
;W[oj]C[Dakre: trying for a sabaki here? black makes territory and you get another heavy group to worry about... this attack is not promissing while having the weak group at the top...]
;B[pi];W[ok];B[oh];W[pm];B[pn];W[lk];B[pk];W[ol];B[kk]C[This isn't right in my opinion.  Don't they say touching weak stones just makes them stronger?

(;W[ik]LB[kl:A]C[Dakre: this cut doesn't work so well because both black groups are almost save... see the variation to explore the other cut at A]

;B[hi];W[gh];B[gi]C[This was an important moment.  He started off really well.  In fact I think hes still ahead but now all my stones are alive in the middle and they probably shouldnt be...]

C[Now your about to witness a demonstartion in sloppy reading.]

(;W[ne]C[Stupid.  Funnily enough the obvious move of m-15 works perfectly.

Dakre: but as you saw, your move could have worked, too... ;) try to read the continuation for black rescuing both marked groups while cutting your central white group apart? it is in the variation]

(;B[me]C[Again stupid. Black o-16 ensures the win of all the stone around m-11.  Now the simple and obvious move of o-16 will ensure I save these very same stones.

Dakre: very nice reading... afterwards ;)];W[nf]C[Pointless but forcing.]
;B[nd];W[of];B[fh]C[A good move.  But Black will win any liberty races anyway.]

;B[qj];W[rl];B[rm];W[mn]C[At this point my best shot is to try j-5 I figure, then see if he falls for the cut with n-7.  If he doesn't then I can probably just resign.  Black has too much solid territory and all my territory is ready to be stolen away like her virginity on prom night.

Dakre: your territory on the lower side is quite nice, too... but there is a lot of aji and black is able to live in there... so the white group in the central area decides about the win or loss of the game]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[ml];W[fj];B[fi];W[ej];B[cq]LB[in:A]C[d-3 is better I think.  Or even f-3.  Now I get to try to win the stones he plays here.  I show horrible technique and fail miserably.

Dakre: i don't agree with d3... because black has still big potential of reducing whites moyo around A...]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[bo]C[Probably white doesn't have the resources for this.

Dakre: nope... this move works when white is very strong nearby... but in this case black should make it... but the decision in playing this move is right... you have to kill this group if you want to win the game. Playing the normal 3-3 Joseki black would be about 20 points ahead i think]

;W[fe];B[ee];W[eg];B[db]LB[dh:A]C[Dakre: this move of course should be A :/ even if black plays A and considering the two marked group as dead... the upper left corner would be open for white... and i still see black about 10 points ahead...]

(;W[ei];B[dh];W[eh];B[mk];W[lj];B[mf];W[hj];B[op];W[np]C[He miscounted he told me.  Anyway I dont lose many games because I am underrated.  I am not sure what my rating should be.  Most of the games I lose are because I turn my brain off and I lose a huge group unnecessarily, not because of any skill on my opponents part.  And the ones I win are much the same story.  So I figured I would just submit one that interested me.  I figure there are lots of things in here of an insidious nature that I wouldn't even pick up on.

Dakre: i know it is difficult but my tip for you is to try to read more ;) even trivial moves... and if you are just playing moves like R13 and so on without being sure about the continuation, the result may suprise you and be exciting, but you don't learn anything ;) it works or it does not... when you try to read the continuation and fail you at least trained your reading skills ;)
