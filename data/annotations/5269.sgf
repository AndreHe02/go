OT[5x30 byo-yomi]
RU[Japanese]

AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, this is the first game I send to GTL. It was played on KGS with 25 minutes with 5x30sec  byo-yomi peiods.
I used to play all defensive and safe in handicap games, but lately some higher kyu friend (whom I can call sensei) told that handicap is given to allow the weaker player a base to attack with. I can't say I really played aggressively but tried to get a large territory.. tables turned as soon as white got sente though. I got squeezed everywhere by massive reduction.
I need to find the balance between safe and big.. I hope this review can help me get an idea.. I also have some questions.. Thank you for your time...

Gunnar: Hi, I will prefix my comments with G: when there are other comments. 

First let me say that I dont recommend submitting won games for review, I always feel there is much more to learn from lost games. 10 points is also quite a substantial victory... 

Second, I dont recommend having handicap games reviewed either - since handicap go is really a different game all together. 

So now for this won handicap game :) 

I agree with your high kyu friend, the handicap stones are there to let you attack without worrying, you are almost guaranteed life from the start, this way you can always make white live small and win early! If you really want to study handicap go, Kageyama has written a book called the "secret chronicles of handicap go", where he presents a handful of pro vs. pro handicap games, showing easy it should be win with just a few handicap stones... it's a highly enjoyable read as well!

(;B[dn]LB[el:A]C[in dont like this... i'm sure it's possible, but since you've pincered already this feels a bit soft... you have to be dedicated to everything you do! So face the fact that your stones will be apart and play at A. 
Secondly, this will become a big tactical fight, and in a handicap game it's natural to assume this will favour white, keep the game simple!]

G: this is too late now, and F10 doesn't seem very important. Grab another side instead (triangles), make an enclosure (not so satisfactory when you only have 4x4 stones, squares) or even make a corner safe by 3x3 could be fun here... (circle)]

(;B[fj]C[T: I should have played something like J11 first and create moyo.. However let's think I played this move after that.. Is it a good move to (or moves if we think D10 and F10 together) reduce whites ability to reach center?

No :) It's not a good move, see variation... if you had split white in half along the LHS, this would have made some sense...]

Gunnar: 

All in all the game was a bit boring, there were no life and death battles :) 
My dan friend says: A weak group is the engine of the game! Especially in a handicap game you should try hard to create them! CUT CUT CUT! (have I said this often enough?)

Don't try for territory in the centre, and don't try to build moyo. Moyo games are very hard to fight, because you will always be under attack, and always being defensive is no fun... in a way you should try to not become dedicated to any type of strategy early on - trying to build a moyo removes your possibilities for using another strategy. 
So only build a moyo when you have no other option!

Finally I would recommend reading "attack and defense", because I always do and it made me alot stronger when I first read it (and whenever I re-read!), and of course play lots and lots of games!

Enjoy go!
