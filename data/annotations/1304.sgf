C[wild : I played black in this game and am not sure why I lost
the game. Along the way, I realise some mistakes but I didn't
think they were fatal. Would like to hear your views. Thank you
in advance for doing this review.];B[pd];W[dp]C[
 wild 5k*: hi];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[jp];B[pj];W[cf];B[fd]LB[ef:b]
[ch:a]C[wild : I guess I could have considered the one step pincer at
'a' as well. But I'm not very good in dealing with the white
response at 'b' and hence I did not choose that joseki.];W[dj]
;B[jj]LB[nq:b][qn:a]C[wild : I considered playing 'a' but white could play k10. Though
I can double pincer at 'b' in response but I'm not confident
with the ensuing fight. So I chose k10.];W[qc];B[qd]LB[pc:a]
C[wild : I think this direction is wrong. I played too fast without
thinking here. Should have played 'a' instead.];W[pc];B[oc]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qf];W[ql]LB[qn:E]
[nq:D][fq:C][cn:B][cl:A]C[Sofar I have no comments, because the play has been fairly symmetrical
and yor own comments are valid as far as I can guess.  After the invasion though, the balance of power has turned to
black. And the question is how Black should use this power. Building
a larger moyo might be wrong because black risks overconcentration.
Black should perhaps aim at invasions that split White further
apart such as the points marked A to E in no particular order.]
;B[ol]LB[pl:a]TR[qn]C[wild : I think White R8 is not good. Better to play at 'a'. What
do you think?

I think it is normal since black cannot expand the moyo efficiently
with a capping move.

One Idea is to fight back immediatley with an invasion at the
triangled spot. The result is hard to predict but at least one
critical ladder favors black and the thickness in the upper part
make any complicated fight favorable to black.];W[pn]LB[cl:B]
[bd:A]C[Playing A is very big, and the followup B would be very severe.
It may also be possible to play B directly and star a fight.]
;B[cq]C[wild : I'm not sure about timing. In restropect, C3 now does
not look good. Where do you think should I have played?

The problem with this move is that any weaknesses white had disappears
after an invasion like this. See the previous commente for suggestions.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[fq];B[fr];W[gr]LB[gp:F][eo:E][fp:D]
[ep:C][hr:B][gq:A]C[This white move is a huge mistake. It leaves very bad aji, such
as the sequence from A to E where Black threatens to catch some
stones in a ladder with F. It is much simpler to extend as in
the joseki (thats why it is joseki).];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]
LB[gq:A]C[Cutting at A should be the primary aim for Black, and Black therefor
has to be careful not helping white to defend against this cut.
It is hard to tell exactly how this aji should be used though
- I only know for sure that this should be part of any plans
that Black has.];B[eg]C[wild : I felt this is biggest point at this moment. Increasing
b's moyo and reducing w's moyo.];W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be]LB[fj:e]
[bc:d][cb:c][bb:b][dc:a]C[wild : At the end of the game, I didn't gain anything on the
left side. So results could have been different if I had played
the sequence a,tb, c, d, e. What would you have done?

In cases like this it is very hard to choose. You chose to fight
back when white invaded and this is good spirit because the cut
at g3 becomes a greater problem for white.];W[bb];B[ad];W[bc]
;B[ce];W[eb]C[The problem with this result is that this move undermines the
entire moyo of black, and if Black do not repond immediately
White may reduce further with sente moves.];B[fj];W[fs];B[dr]
;W[nq]LB[ep:B][gq:A]TR[bo][cp][dp][cn][dj][cf]C[This white move is a little slow. This is perhaps the perfect
opportunity for Black to cut at A or B, since the marked stones
are vulnerable.];B[jn]C[wild : I think b is leading at this point. Am I right?

The game looks promising for Black but it is not a comfortable
lead. And to me the lead consists of mainly ot the cuts I mentioned
earlier, because allowing those cuts is the only obvious mistake
that white has made sofar.];W[ho];B[lp]LB[kp:A]TR[nq][jp]C[This is bad shape. It is never good to invade at this  spot between the two marked white stones. Any other invasion
is better (if they work...) It is easier to play elsewhere instead
or play the attachment at A which has a relationship to the capping
move at K6. But the best idea is probably to try one of the cuts
and choose a strategy depending on how White answers. A move
like this just help white to defend a gain secure territory,
or offer white a chance to start a fight.];W[lq];B[kp];W[kq]
;B[jo];W[io];B[jq];W[ip];B[mq]C[There is no good reason to play like this since White has not
made any mistake here and is strong nearby. Unless Black has
completely read out the local tactics a move like this is just
a perfect opportunity for the opponent to fight back.   Consider the risks involved here. White may lose 5-10 points
at the side but black may lose the entire moyo in the center.]
;W[mp];B[mr];W[jr];B[kr];W[iq];B[lr];W[jq]C[One Idea here is to invade the corner. That is not
simple since there are lot of variations and I am to weak to
read it out. It looks to me that this is a 50-50 gamble. But
losing that fight is not as bad as losing a fight inside your
own moyo... thats the point here.]
(;B[np];W[mo];B[oq];W[pq];B[no];W[mn];B[nn];W[mm];B[nm];W[ml]
LB[mi:B][mj:A]C[wild : I guess I've invited w into b's moyo with this sequence
of play :-(. In particular, miscounting the ensuing fight and
had to give up around 15 points in the centre.

This is a case of severe greed, playing at A or B is enough even
if White can easily capture the black stones, black did break
through the white territory and should be happy that exchange.]
;B[kn]LB[jl:B][ko:A]C[White should consider throwing in a stone at A in order to remove
a liberty for black. Even better would to play B immediately
to catch all black stones on larger scale while threatening the
black moyo.];W[ln]C[Another chance for Black to calm down];B[ko]
;W[jl];B[kl];W[kk];B[il];W[jk];B[ik];W[jm];B[kj];W[lk];B[im]
C[Playing here is bad because it just helps White to remove a liberty
from the dead black stones. Saving the moyo is urgent: if black
is lucky white might be forced to remove the dead black stones
from the board in gote in later fighting. This move is also aji
keshi because black could in principle attempt to escape with
these stones in the future.];W[in];B[or]LB[pr:a]C[wild : P2 was really small since my B group not in any danger.
I had wishfully hoped that w would response by blocking at 'a'.

Never wish anything in go and always play the urgent moves first.
Stronger players are often rather paranoid and would not dare
to play a move that if answered was worth as little as this non-sente
move. Only play moves like this if the opponent can play there
first and make a huge profit.];W[mi];B[lh];W[li];B[kh];W[mh]
;B[qk];W[pl];B[ok];W[rk];B[oi];W[rj];B[dl]LB[ch:A]TR[cn][dj]
C[This move was bad on the lower side and the sequence played in
the game is the classical proof why this is a bad move.

Black should play A first. This move will threat an invasion
AND take profit.];W[cl];B[ck];W[dk];B[cm];W[bl]C[Black is forced to connect]
;B[dm];W[bm]TR[ck]C[The marked stone cannot move. If it could then the invasion would
not had been that bad. In the game White is simply connected
and Black get three heavy stones.];B[fl];W[dh];B[dg]C[Pushing down here probably just help white to defend the stones]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[di];B[fb]C[At least this is a success for Black, because white probably
had sente moves here all the time.];W[ec];B[fc];W[df];B[ee]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[ca];B[mg];W[oh]C[ A quick count gives an equal result if black defends carefully
here but then white get sente to play first on the upper side
in and then in the lower right.]

it does not work..];W[ng];B[mf];W[nf];B[me];W[mb];B[lb];W[pg]

;B[aq]
(;W[ao];B[dc];W[db];B[cs]C[wild : I was worried about W playing at C1 and getting seki here.
Was I just paranoid?

No, I think it is ko since I cannot even see a seki. Perhaps
what you see is a "bent four in the corner" which look like a
seki but is a hidden ko in reality. Search in the go litterature
for an explanation if this is not known to you.];W[en];B[fn]
;W[ek];B[po];W[qo];B[on];W[qn]C[White should take the ko once and force black to use a kothreat
(nitpicking)];B[do];W[co];B[fk];W[sj];B[sd];W[sc];B[se];W[si]
;B[rh];W[ph];B[ed];W[ac];B[oe];W[ae];B[oo];W[ad];B[nj];W[bk]
C[Main conclusion: I think Black lost because he did not pick the
best fights. It is important to fight when the odds is in your
favor and it is important to avoid fights when there is no reason
to fight. It is also important to strategically play moves that
increases your chances to win a future fight that look likely
to occur. In the late fuseki and the middle game this is the
key to find moves that has double meanings. It often hard to
prove that such moves are indeed the best, but it is good for
your intuition if you try to find such moves.

I hope that my comments was valuable, despite that the difference
in strength is not that large. That is why some of my advice
is perhaps less precise compared to that of a stronger player.]
