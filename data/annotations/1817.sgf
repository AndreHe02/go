C[Game played: 2/25/2002 at 20:16];B[cp]C[Hello Norbert and 'opponent'.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[pc];B[eq]C[Fairly standard so far.  The C4, E3 shimari is easier to use if d17 is at d16.  The reason for this is the formation naturally wants to extend out to say d10 and at the same time b wants to make a shimari at say c15, but it seems unlikely b will get both of these.  Note, I'm not saying what you've played is wrong at all, just it means in the following fuseki you're going to have more to think about than if d17 was at d16.]
;W[de];B[dh]C[interesting pincer.  The general idea is d12 acts as an extension from the shimari and as pressure on d15.  I personally don't feel the shimari is powerful enough to justify this, w will extend out with say f15, f17 and when w attacks d12 I don't think c4 is close enough for support, but this may just be a personal preference.  Also note that c17 is a very natural move for w now, so w will have absolutly no trouble settling.]
;W[ec]C[Odd choice of direction by w. This move forces b to live in the corner, but since the corner is big I personally would be delighted to be forced to live there.  c16 and d16 are the most natural moves, with e18 also worth considering.  I'd go for d16 I think. If I went for c16 it would be with the intention of playing c15 in response to d16, and I think the corner is too good to let w reduce it like that.]
;B[cd];W[eb];B[cf]C[ok, I agree a move here is better than d18, but I think b is better of at c15 than c14 simply because d17 is weak.  W c18 after c15 is starting to look annoying for b]
;W[ge]C[surprising by w again.  This forms quite an impressive wall along the top, but is purely gote.

B can choose to ignore completly and play e.g. d9, or deal with it indirectly with e.g. a kakari at say r15.]
;B[kq]C[also ok, though not as sente as I would have liked.  The split wing formation is more effective when b is stronger, the gap between c4 and d12 seems a bit much to me.]
;W[iq]C[Agressive, I'm pretty sure this is a mistake by W.  B can attack quite forcefully, starting at say k4, and once the attack slows down b can casually settle at o3, or even p3 if b is worried about space and doesn't mind losing aji.  W is going to get heavy very quickly and if things go well for b, then b will get a good stone at say e5 that will make d12 look much better placed.

Basically, C4 is already settled and L3 is too easy to settle, so w is in between two strong groups.]
;B[nq]C[ok, but attack first];W[oq];B[np];W[pn]C[right, you're a bit lucky w didn't ignore o3 to escape,  this joseki means you're now quite settled and can really attack j3, I'd expect w to sacrifice it.]
;B[qj]C[much better to attack j3 I think];W[qe];B[qg];W[df]
C[either c13 or c15 is necessary.  c13 is more common but I'd pull back to c15 to help d17.  This is contrary to your plan when you played c14 so you might want to continue your plan with c13]
;B[dg]C[too much weakness];W[ed]C[gote, I'd play c15 now, or sacrifice the corner and strengthen r10]
;B[db];W[cj]C[this is just asking for c7];B[dj]C[I don't like d10, it forces w to invade what could have been black's territory.]
;W[dk];B[ci];W[da];B[ck]C[c19 is surprisingly big, but ok];W[ce]
;B[be]C[I assume you're planning on sacrificing c14 and living small in the corner.  Given how much damage this will do to the middle I would be seriously tempted to save c14.  At least that way you get sente.]
;W[bf];B[bd];W[cg];B[ca];W[bj]C[interesting.  Clearly b cannot play b9 now, but what ifb plays b11 instead? B11, b9, c8, b8, c7, ... it doesn't look at all good for w.]

(;B[ek]C[I don't like this move at all.  c9 is a useful stone for b and this sacrifices it]
;W[bi]C[only choice is to capture d8];B[bb]C[Huh? You could play e19 instead if you wanted to play here.]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[cn]C[cut at d6, w is shorter on liberties than b]
;B[bn];W[en];B[co];W[eg]C[capture, it will allow b to pressure w and escape or sacrifice for a greater return]
;B[dn];W[fm];B[el]C[f8 is much better];W[em];B[fj]C[bad shape because of e11]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[oi];B[qm];W[qn];B[ok]C[ok, given that you have very few invasion points into the top, I would have gone in that direction instead]
;W[mi];B[eh];W[ql];B[pm]C[better to sacrifice R7 in exchange for eyeshape, e.g. R9]
;W[rm];B[om];W[gh];B[mk]C[feels a little too small];W[gk];B[gj]
;W[hj]
(;B[hi]C[cut first, g8 works fairly well there too];W[hk];B[gi]
;W[hh]C[big mistake by w.  playing k10 instead would have fixed all of white's aji.  Incidentially, b has to be pretty careful about eyespace too here.]
;B[ii];W[ei];B[fi];W[ch];B[di];W[ij];B[ji];W[jj];B[ki];W[lj]
;B[lh]C[too passive.  as with o3, even if you have to play here eventually, pushing through at l10 first is essential.  If b plays l10, where does w play? L9? then b can cut with m9 and leave w stranded. H7? Then b just continues through at l9 casually.]
;W[kj]C[w says 'thank goodness'];B[mg];W[og];B[pf]C[risky but quite big]
;W[fh];B[ej];W[pe];B[of]C[w is very generous again];W[mf];B[nf]
C[ok, o13 is easier to read as working];W[ng];B[lf];W[rf];B[me]
;W[mh];B[nc];W[oe]C[ok, now b is settled it is time to take stock again.  There is a nice attack around g8 that can be threatened with the intention of capturing j3.  W also has bad aji at f13 which b can take advantage of soon.  Moves like p2 are worth a bit, though they are aji keshi if you're planning on S9 and later R3 once you're stronger.]
;B[ih];W[ff]C[ok, not a great way of using e13, but you at least got points in sente.  I'd guess b is very slightly ahead now, so if you get a few good moves in sente you should be able to hold the lead through the yose.  It looks like J17 works now incidentially.]
;B[hg]C[gote];W[rh]C[not a bad move by w, b is almost forced to r12, they even have to hesitate about s13 first since with s10 w can possibly ignore it]
;B[qh];W[ri];B[qi];W[ie]C[ouch, nice sequence by w.  B loses a lot of territory and w settles the top.  I'd play s9 now, then p2, but I think w just changed the score from a small b win to a small w win.]
;B[hf]C[gote, w just ignores ad plays j5];W[he];B[if]C[tiny]
;W[io];B[ko];W[lc]C[a little too greedy perhaps by w];B[je]
;W[nb]C[k16 is probably bigger];B[jc];W[mb];B[id];W[hc];B[hd]

C[why not t8?];W[sl];B[ql]C[filling a one point ko?? you need to keep fighting.]
;W[nd];B[rn];W[sm];B[on];W[ro];B[po];W[qo];B[oo]C[gote sequence, otherwise ok.  e5 is fairly big if you don't mind gote.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[in];B[op];W[pr];B[or];W[pq];B[nr];W[ic]C[q1 is big enough to play]
;B[jd];W[jb];B[kb];W[fr]C[interesting tenuki by w since after j10 b must l17, perhaps because n17 is then atari.]
;B[ja]C[e2 is bigger, though not by much];W[jr];B[er]C[good]
;W[ep]C[bad shape by w, tenuki (q1) or f3];B[fp];W[fo];B[dp]
;W[gp];B[eo];W[kr]C[that went ok, definatly time for q1 now ...]
;B[lr];W[pg];B[qf]C[why not s13 first?
you need to push w around a little bit more, so w keeps feeling a little cautious.]
;W[bk];B[ph]C[1 point gote? s13 is better, q1 is better, n16, e19, even b8 are all better.]
;W[bl];B[bm];W[es];B[oh]C[six points versus the damage d2 threatens.  I'd play d2 as w, if b plays o12 then b2 or even just c2 are pretty devestating]
;W[nh];B[nj]C[too small again];W[ni];B[li]C[this is a big enough threat , but it isn't worth anything]
;W[mj];B[ds];W[fs];B[cr];W[ls];B[ms];W[lq];B[ks];W[kp];B[lp]
;W[jq];B[mq]C[you could play m5 instead];W[jl];B[kq];W[km];B[jp]
;W[jn]C[seems about fair, maybe slightly better for w.  B still has q1 and s13 just sitting there?]
;B[ip];W[mm];B[hp];W[hr];B[hq];W[ho];B[is]C[k1 better, easier to end with sente]

;W[ag];B[ae];W[la];B[md]C[dame again?];W[am];B[an];W[al];B[ka]
;W[nn]C[good spirit by w, though w needs to be careful since o19 is atari, so this can easily turn into a big invasion.]
;B[ma];W[na];B[mo]C[o5 is better if you must play here, but it is very small.  O15 is atari, try and play your sente moves before defending.]
;W[la];B[ea]C[too early for 1 point kos, especially with q1, but also f3 and o15.  play the one point kos last.]
;W[jf];B[ig];W[da];B[ma];W[lg];B[kg];W[la];B[ne];W[od]C[good, a ko threat that you got a point from.  I assume you realise there is no point playing the ko since w can just play the other ko for an infinate number of threats.]
;B[ea];W[dr];B[dq];W[da];B[ma];W[cs];B[bs];W[la]C[you really should play your sente moves like f3 and q1.]
;B[ea];W[oj];B[nk];W[da];B[fe]C[these moves are fine in a real ko fight, but pointless here.]
;W[ef];B[ea];W[pk]C[this move costs w a point, which is rather silly in a one point ko fight.]
;B[pj];W[da];B[ma];W[fq]C[good finally.  this is e4 vs g2, so two points.]
;B[ep];W[la];B[ea];W[ga]C[now we've got a triple ko.  You may as well fill d19]

;B[ma];W[os];B[ns];W[la];B[ha];W[rs]C[huh? this is free points to b]
;B[ss];W[sn];B[sq];W[rp];B[sp];W[ia];B[sr]C[Overall I think B's biggest mistake was not putting enough pressure on W.  I think w generally played better than b and probably deserved to win by a bigger margin.  Both players missed sente moves and played small gote moves first.

Both players also failed to notice w sealing up a large area at the top, with w almost asking b to invade there after H10 etc., and similarly b missed an opportunity to put a lot of pressure on j3 and f7.]
