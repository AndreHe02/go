C[hello my name spyro 367i'm 8k on kgs  thanks for rewiewing^_^

ps: i putted 2 variations don't forget to look at them

Hello, I앐 Peter and 3. Kyu. I hope, I can help you.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fp];W[cn];B[ip]LB[kp:B][dq:C][fq:A]C[Peter: This move is unusual. If White A, the marked Black stone becomes overconcentrated, while White secure a lot of territory (See variation). If you want play lightly, you should play at B. If you want to strengthen your stone, play at C.
You also can play elsewhere.]
(;W[nq];B[lq];W[pr]
(;B[pm]LB[qj:D][pn:C][no:B][qq:A]SQ[pp]C[was q7 good i'm not too sure about it
Peter: I think, it압 ok. You can also  prevent Black from taking the corner by doing yourself with A. After that, there is enough time, to extend at the right side. (See variation) 
Without the exchange BA, WB the connecting between the two marked stones is a little bit thin.
That압 the reason for that:  if you want to play at the right side, play C and if White A, take the big point D.]
;W[qq]
(;B[qp];W[no];B[ln]LB[fc:A]C[Peter: Too small. Play at A.];W[dj]
;B[pi]LB[fc:A][jd:B]C[Peter: It압 to one-sided. Play A or B. 
I prefer A, because the exchange BB, WA is too good for White.]
;W[nc]
(;B[id]LB[kc:A][lc:B]C[here i tought about getting influence on the top was this move good to do so?
Peter: It압 too easy for White to build eyeshape with A  (A is the right extension for White). Better to play at B. (See variation)]
;W[kc];B[kd];W[jc]LB[ld:A]C[Peter: White압 mistake. I think A is correct, but I앐 not sure.]
;B[ld]C[Peter: It압 look to be the right answer.];W[jd];B[je]
;W[qf]LB[lc:A][ie:B]C[Peter: That압 seems to be an overplay. Connect with A  then cut at B seems to be a good choice..]

(;B[oc]LB[oe:A]C[Peter: At A!! Hold the White stones separated. (See variation)]
;W[nd];B[qe];W[pf]TR[oc][qe]C[were there any better move to play then these
Peter: See comment B 27.];B[lc]LB[qc:A]C[Peter: Good. But there is a bad aji at A.]
;W[ic];B[hc];W[hd];B[ie];W[gc];B[hb]LB[ib:A]TR[ic][jc][kc][jd]
C[could he had saved this group?
Peter: A seems to work for White. (see variation)]
(;W[gb];B[ib]C[Peter: Now black is ahead, and it should be easy for him to win the game.]
;W[he];B[gh]LB[oe:A][cf:D][hg:B][ih:E][nm:C]C[i'm not too sure about that either should it had been closer to the other groups?
Peter: Now it압 difficult to build a big moyo, because of White at A. (see variation)
It압 also hard to use the moyo to make territory, because of WB and WC.
I prefer in this case to attack at D.
If you want to enlarge the moyo, I propose E, but it압 not easy, too attack the White stones around A!
Consider: Black E and White at 41 - the White moyo becomes big too.]

(;W[pc]LB[qc:A]C[Peter: at A.];B[qc];W[pb];B[ob];W[rd];B[re]
;W[od];B[qb];W[rf];B[se];W[nb];B[pa];W[lb]LB[pe:A]C[Peter: First White at A. It압 sente for both sides.]
;B[kb];W[mf];B[lh]LB[pe:A]C[Peter: strong move. Now White must try to live with his group.
You should think about, to play first at A, because it압 sente for both sides.]
;W[jj]C[Peter: Looks like an overplay.];B[lk]LB[ri:A]C[Peter: Whats about Black A?]
;W[ri];B[rj];W[qj]LB[rh:A]C[Peter: Overplay. Must be played at A.]
;B[qi];W[rk];B[rh];W[sj];B[sh]LB[qh:A]C[Peter: Game over.
But connect at A, and there isn앖 bad aji any more.];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[ok]LB[qh:A]C[Peter: Now there is a risk of the cut at A. I think, it doesn앖 work, but it leads to many complications, and that압 good for White, because he is behind.]
;B[nm];W[qm];B[qn];W[ql];B[ro]LB[pn:A]C[Peter: better A to keep the White stones separated and connect your own.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[on];B[rq];W[om];B[gl]LB[ni:A]C[Peter: What about A now? It kills the upper White group surely.]
;W[er];B[gr]LB[cf:A]C[Peter: Too small. For example: A is bigger.]
;W[ni]LB[qh:A]C[Peter: Yes, I think, now the upper White group can live by cutting at A!]
;B[sf]
(;W[hf]LB[qh:A]C[around here i thought about connecting at R12 was it okay to wait?
Peter: White can cut at A immediately. See comments B81/W84 and variations.]
