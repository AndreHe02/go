C[Ted: It seems as though no matter what I try in my games, I fall badly behind early on.  I've been criticized by other reviewers for playing too passively, but in this game, the two times I had the chance to attack, at L3 and R6, they both ended up being reasons why I ended up falling behind with weak groups

pajaro: Hi. I'll review your game. I'll try to point out your mistakes and help you seeing what happened. Enjoy.]
;B[pc];W[dp]C[Ted: I thought about playing at Q4 to prevent Black from his choice of fuseki, but figured that at my low level of play, it didn't make much difference.

pajaro: I guess you have to be pretty good to say that the 2nd move can be bad... I won't say it :)]
;B[pp];W[dc];B[de]
(;W[fd]C[pajaro: Playing this, w will try to make points at the top. However, look at Q17. Considering the top, that stone is in the 3rd line. You don't want to make points there if this happens. On the other side, your D4 is on the 4th line, so you want to make points on the left. You might consider to pincer here. See var.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[ec]C[Ted: I don't think I've seen this move before, and I didn't know how to respond.

pajaro: Your answer is fine, w got a good position.];W[ed];B[dd]
;W[db];B[cn];W[fp];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp]
(;W[qn]C[Ted: I didn't think I needed to play another stone in the bottom left yet, and that if I did, I'd get criticized for playing moves that are too small.

pajaro: Playing there is not small, because b will need to answer, and securing the corner gives good points.]
;B[qp];W[pj]C[Ted: I've been told that Q9 and R9 are too small, but every time I jump out this far, I get split at Q8 or R8.

pajaro: This move is fine. It doesn't matter that b invades, becasue w will get thickness in compensation.]
;B[iq]
(;W[en]C[Ted: I wonder if I should have played L3 or M3 instead, but looking at the position, I'm worried about Black playing around E6 and sealing me into a small amount of territory on the side.

pajaro: W is thin, and it should be apparent now that w had to reinforce before. B3 is better here.]
;B[dq]C[Ted: Needless to say, I didn't see this coming.];W[eq]
;B[dr];W[er];B[do];W[ep];B[cr]C[Ted: Now I'm not even going to get an eye on the side.

pajaro: W is badly hurt now. Under attack, b is going to take control of the game.]

(;W[dn]C[pajaro: This move is not good. You want to make sure that b won't cut? There are many moves for that. Also, the b corner is alive, so w can't press b.]
;B[cl];W[el]C[pajaro: Now w is behind. If both sides keep on jumping, w will never catch b. You must try to be ahead, or not push at all.]
;B[dj]C[pajaro: The left side is black. Also, any chance to attack the top b group is gone. Meanwhile, w has got nothing in this fight.]
;W[kq]C[Ted: I already felt desperate.  I've got a terribly weak group, while Black has the entire left side of the board.

pajaro: It's true that b is better. L4 shows fighting spirit. If w can take advantage of attacking j3, there is still hope.]
;B[mq];W[ko]C[pajaro: This might allow b to connect. See var.]

(;B[mo];W[km]C[Ted: I'm not sure if I should have played this, or tried to kill the J3 stone.

pajaro: You must try to kill j3 in a big scale. But L3 is still there.]
;B[ql]C[Ted: I knew this was going to come at some point, but if I play to prevent it, I get criticized for playing too small and giving up sente.

pajaro: Get some thickness. You are going to need it in the fight.]

;W[qm];B[pk];W[ol];B[qk];W[ok];B[qj];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[mi]C[Ted: At least it looks like I don't have to give up a giant group of stones.

pajaro: No, but b is getting point severywhere. Living alone is not enough. You must get some compensation. Also, a b play at Q13 is very big, as it will give also the right side to b.]
;B[pf]C[pajaro: Close. B is very ahead now.];W[in]C[pajaro: W seems to want to capture J3. But playing J6 now is small. Too many stones invested to kill that stone. But L2 is still available. If b couldn't connect, b should die even with no reinforcement.]
;B[ff];W[hd]C[pajaro: Let's look at the F14-H16 exchange. F14 made the left side bigger for b. H16 doesn't get much profit, and also extends very short from a strong position. Clearly, b gets the best here.]
;B[kr]C[pajaro: At last... b will conect and take the only big territory from w.]

(;W[hq]C[Ted: I didn't see the sequence that was about to follow.

pajaro: You might try the other atari.];B[ir];W[ho];B[jp];W[io]
;B[kp]C[Ted: I had tried to reduce Black on the bottom, and it's failed.]
;W[jo];B[lp];W[kk]C[pajaro: This is another move that gets nothing.B can't attack any group, no need to connect them. And w can't get points in the center, because it's open.]
;B[hr];W[gq];B[jc]C[Ted: And now, I'm going to be stuck with a weak group on the top.]
;W[hc]C[Ted: Perhaps I should have played M17 instead, but we saw what happened when I attacked at the bottom of the board.

pajaro: M17 was a better move. W is very thick, your only chance is to fight everywhere. Like this, you are giving b a good position at the top too.]
;B[je];W[me]C[Ted: This was an attempt to reduce Black at the top, but it doesn't do much.

pajaro: No. At this point it's the best w can do, but it isn't enough.]
;B[mc]
(;W[mg]C[pajaro: Afraid again. With so much thickness, that w stone has to be able to escape. Better try to invade a corner, for example.]
;B[fj];W[gl]C[pajaro: The same again. B presses, increases its territory, and w defends very little in gote. All the rest is the same. No more comments about the game.

My conclusion is that you wanted to play big moves with little success. You said several times that people tell you play small moves, and it's true. You are a too territorial player. If you think you have 10 points in some place, you are determined to defend them, even if it means that your opponent get 30 points. H17, H16, G8 are examples of it. You have to try to see the whole board. It was too easy for b to keep sente all the time, because you were afraid of all his moves. You have to try to read the situation. You can't just say that as he won a battle, he would surely win all of them, so defend, defend, defend. Anyway, from your comments I see that you tried to play different in this game, and that's very good. As long as you try to play better, it doesn't matter that you lose. Sooner or later, things will work and you'll improve.
Good luck.];B[hf];W[cd];B[ce];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[hb];W[gb]

;B[ld]C[Ted: I did a quick estimation of the score at this point, and determined that I had maybe 40 points of territory.  I counted at least 100 points for Black, and couldn't see any way to reduce Black, so I resigned.]
