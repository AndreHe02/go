C[Hi my name is Andrew. I play black in this game. My rank is 13kyu on kgs. I was playing against an opponent of unknown difficulty. I feel I played really well. But I ended up losing by half a point. I will comments throughout the game. Feel free to critique anything and everything (I feed off of the feedback). I feel I would have lost by a lot more, but my opponent kept trying desperate moves near the end.


Y: Hi I'm Yi sheng. I'm ~5-7 kyu. I will comment mainly on bigger mistakes.]

Y: Thanks for submitting your game. I enjoyed reviewing it.

To summarise, play more hane in the opening/midgame. Learn when you shouldn't tenuki. Hane at the head of two stones. Try to see which of your groups is in most trouble, and help it. Try to see which of your opponent's groups is in most trouble, and attack it.]
