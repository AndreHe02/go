;B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[nq];W[pn];B[qo];W[po];B[qp]C[Usually this is played inmediately at san-san R3, in fact black 7 is not
so often played neither, and I think that entering at the corner so early
is not so good strategy and just settling at the lower side with an extension
around k4 or the usual joseki black Q2 etc would be natural for black.]
;W[qq]C[Good.];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[pq];B[qm];W[qn];B[rn]C[This exange is usually bad, unless the cut at S7 makes black answer
at S8 so white can increase his wall giving atari at Q7 and even though
as anyway pushing at Q7 inmediately is sente and white doesn't lose
1 liberty at R6. Now white has also lose the possibility of playing at R9
threatening to play at S6];W[kp];B[no];W[mn]C[May be better first nozoki at N4, black connects and then
white O6 or O7. Attacking from here is a bit dangerouse.];B[nn]
C[I thimk black should have played at M5];W[nm];B[pm]C[Black should better worry about the other stones, trying to
counter-attack on white stones is not wise.
M5 or the cut at N7 look plausible.];W[om];B[on]C[Awfull shape! M5 still !]
;W[mo];B[np]C[Instead of O4 maybe N4 would be more troublesome.]

;W[qj]C[Protecting at L7 would be much safer. And also bigger: instead of destroying
a bit of black potential with R10 white should be thinking of making
the most of he's wall toward the center -left.];B[pk];W[pj]
;B[oj]C[Now white has 3 cuts : L6, N7 & P10, with not so many liberties  - is better never to count the 2 liberties in the bamboo joint -
Maybe to sacrifice the 2 stones at Q10 would be the better strategy ?
That means both R10 adn Q10 where bad.];W[oi];B[ml];W[mk];B[lk]
;W[km];B[nj];W[mj];B[ni];W[nh]C[Still I think that instead of O12 M10 would be better: white would keep
points and strength at left and at least thousands of ko threats at the
right side.];B[mi];W[li];B[nl]C[Black counter attack looks like a success: 60 + points change !]
;W[mh];B[ol];W[de]C[But this rescue has not been for free: 7 points are lost each time you
add a stone in a ladder that cannot escape, and it was gote, and the shape
white gets in the center is awfully strong. I think white still is ahead.  Althought black has make up a bit from his mistake when dieing first
at lower side.];B[cg]C[Don't like this move: white's stronger both at the upper side because of the
capture and at lower left because of hoshi stone and wall, black should
play at F16, seeking to make white's strenght at top useless by developing
safe groups.];W[ec];B[ce];W[dd];B[cd];W[df];B[cf];W[nd]C[Maybe is because I'm not a territorial player myself, but I like
very much white position at top.];B[lc]C[White's too strong here, black should play more carefully.]
;W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob];B[qf];W[jc]C[Interesting sequence by white, black should reduce lightly from G12 or
something like that ...];B[hc]C[... instead he's seeking troubles.]
;W[je];B[he];W[hf]C[G14 looks better :" Don't touch what you are attacking ... it could bite !"
If then black J14 white he's running   into M11.
