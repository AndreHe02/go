;B[pd]C[My friend Bob and I are playing one slow 20/20 game per week on IGS.  I am
black and even though I won I would like some feedback on the opening.  I am
a big fan of Takemiya's style in the 1980's, but his current opening
confuses me.  Mr. Wu (Go Seigen says that the first three moves I used in
this game are the san-ren-sei of the 21st century.  This is my third attempt
with this opening and al have gone well, but I seem forced to play a
territory game and rely on the center star point to negate my opponent's
influence.  Is this natural or merely okay or should I be doing something
influence-oriented, and if so - what?

janr: I think the center star point aims at influence.  However, like all stones played, it can be used flexible as the game develops.]

(;B[ed]C[prevents the second shimari as dictated by the proverb.

An alternative would be to consider all these shimari as slow play as develop the center star point at once.  I try some variations]
;W[gc];B[eb];W[jc]C[This move is probably not joseki.
Usually white plays on the left side]
(;B[qk]C[I feel the joseki in the upper left is not finished yer.  Black has a weak group there which can be strengthened in sente (attacking the white corner stone)

playing an influence-oriented game, black must consider carefully before making a weak group.  In the moyo-game strategy usually first a huge moyo is mapped out, urging the opponent to create weak groups by invading.  By creating a weak group himself, black makes it easier for white to invade, even if he succeeds in making a moyo.]

C[I think white played too submissive in the latter part of the game.
Sometimes, fighting is necessary.  It is particulary easy when you are strong as white on the left.

In the opening black didnt follow a consistent influence oriented strategy, and so his center star point stone partially lost its value.

Both players played some slow moves, missing the opportunity to tenuki to a more urgent part of the board.]
