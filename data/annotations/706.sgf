;B[qp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[oq];W[pf];B[qj];W[dn];B[co]C[Maybe this is a wrong move?

  Comments at C5:

  I think the reason why W D6 instead of C6 is that he was probably afraid
  that B would E6 respond to C6.

  Remember, B has a small moyo at the right side by now.  The idea is to    move close to it and enclose it, not move away from it.  Thus, at least,    B probably should play F4?

  To use the background(P3-R4) more effectively, I would play at F5.
  B F5 W F7 B H6 W H8 B K7 W K9.... go on and on....  until B reaches    enclosure.  W's moyo look bigger than B's, but it is thinner as well.
  Say, B F5 W F7 B H6, W make a move at side.... D11, B G8 right away.
  Therefore, W can't quit the sequence.  If W try to cut B's connection,
  at E5, G6, or J7, evidently, W will strength both side of B.  W could    break B's lower side territory, but B will get an other moyo at right side.]
;W[cn];B[gp]C[  Comments at G4:

  F4 better now.  F5 too thin since you had C5 first.

  The way to analysis it is that: If B played at F5 first, W C6, whould B C5?
  I think B would F7 at that point.  Therefore, F5 is out if C5 first.]
;W[dj]C[At this point, I think he's ahead. At least, I like more the disposition of  his stones.

  Comment on B's comment:

  No.  W is not ahead.

  Reason: Look at B's moyo.  If W try to invade lower side, B will have    lower-left corner and hopefully the right side.  If W try to invade right,    B will be strengthed at lower and corner.  Second, it is B's turn to move.
  Once B settle a base at upper side, W only has left side and upper-right
  corner.  Once left is invaded, W has nothing left.  If not invaded, W has
  no potential to develop more territory.  Unlike B, B has G6/P10 to expand
  the moyo.  Therefore, B is ahead at this point to me.];B[jc]
C[What about this invasion? Maybe better at F17?

  Comments at K17:

  As long as B make a move at upper side, whether to chose F17/K17/O17 is
  a style problem.  All the moves could develop into different game plan.]
;W[hc];B[mc];W[oc];B[fc]C[  Comments at F17: (The following is a more advanced idea)

  What is W's intention of H17?  Territory of the upper side, right?
  Thus, C17 is a better choice here.  It is an indirect move.  B C17...
  If W C16, follow the joseki, B D17 E17 E18 F17 F18 G17/G18 B16 B15 B17 C14
  G6... By now, H17 doesn't achieve anything.  Same analysis: If B play C17    first,  W C16, after joseki, W wouldn't H17, right?

  What about B C17, W D17?  This way, W make a mistake at direction.  W is
  stopping B from the NARROWER side --- nonsense.  Thus, playing at C17 now,
  W will have a hard time to choose D17 or C16 --- both of them more or less
  make the EXISTED stones LESS EFFECTIVE.

  The correct sequence is B C17 C16 D17 E17 E18 F18...  I will leave the
  rest for B/W to study :)];W[gd];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[ce]
C[  Comment at C15:

  Always D18 first.];W[cf];B[bf];W[cg];B[bg];W[ch];B[db];W[eb]
;B[cb];W[fb];B[id]C[  Comment at J16:

  Why move your stone toward W's thick wall?  N15 better.  W's wall can't    gain much territory because you have K17-N17 there.  As long as K17-N17
  is safe, B is ahead.  N15 put some pressure on right-upper corner as well.
  Once B also gets N18/O18... R15/R17 is big play, if W respond to N18/O18,
  B gets sente.
  Again, Don't move your stone toward to enemy's strength, move toward to
  their weakness.];W[lb];B[nb];W[lc];B[ld];W[md];B[kc];W[ob]
C[  Comment at P18:

  W N18 O17 O16... B is in trouble...];B[mb];W[nc];B[kb];W[le]
;B[kd];W[iq];B[lq]C[Wrong direction?

  Comment on M3:

  Right direction, but not enough.  B should L3.  Now, W has L3 to make
  shape...  If interested at details of W L3, ask seperately.  L3 means that
  W doesn't care if B strength at the low-right --- because P3-R4 is strong.
  L3 makes it even stronger but won't have impack to J3 stone.  The price of    that is W will try to gain something from the thin move of B --- G4.     Once W settle at here, D2/E3/F3 is hard for B to convert the whole corner
  into territory.  Thus, W gets point here.];W[gq];B[fq]C[In the following few move he manages to close me in the corner, while  building a huge wall, promising an also huge moyo. Should I have sacrified  points in the lower side in exchange for breaking his wall?

  Comment on your comment:

  Exactly my point.  G4 is too thin for B to have    EVERYTHING.  Therefore, B should go for a smaller corner --- i.e. let W live
  at lower side --- and gain control to center --- i.e. helping the moyo at
  right side.];W[fp];B[ep]C[  Comment at E4:

  B should learn when to and when NOT to atari.  E3 is a better move.
  After E3, B has F5 to catch F4 or H3 to catch G3.  In the meantime, corner
  is as safe as solid rock.  The idea here is: Corner is B's base.  So, B is
  fighting with W's F4 and G3 using only G4...  B has only ONE weak group, W    has TWO.  As G4 run toward center, nothing for B to worry --- 3 HUGE    corners, upper-side, and one moyo at right.  B is way ahead to me.]
;W[fo];B[hq];W[gr];B[fr]C[  Comment at F2:

  If B E3 before, no need F2 here, H4 would be a better choice, wouldn't it?]
;W[hp];B[hr];W[go];B[gs];W[ir];B[gp];W[lp];B[mp]C[Once more, I think L4 could have been better

  Comment on N4:

  Not L4, N3.  B N4 is helping W to play at M5.  If N3, W still M5?  In    addition, you have the right to L4.  B N3 N4 O4, now B L4 becomes a series
  problem.  If W L4, B J14.  If W O5, B L4.

  W O5 B L4 W L3 is not going to work.  B L4 L3 L5 M6 K3 L2 J4...]
;W[lo];B[mo];W[kq];B[lr]C[  Comment at M2:

  M6 is bigger.  Not only limit W's moyo, also expend B's moyo at right.
  To expend futher, B's next move is P11.];W[do];B[bo]C[  Comment at B5:

  C4 is better.  Save B6 for later.  If W B5 right away, B has sente and
  take M6 or J14.  Corner is alive.  If been hane twice --- W gets B5 and A4
  --- only lose about 8 to 10 pts.  If W had J13 and M6, I think it will be
  more than 10 pts, don't you think so?];W[bn];B[cq];W[hg];B[jf]
C[  Comment at K 14 and the idea of Moyo:

  General speaking, Invade a moyo right before it gets the last touch.  Not
  AFTER --- that is called suiscide.  B should ask himself, what does K14 get?
  More territory?  Threats to W's group?  Or is K14 the ONLY ENTEWRENCE to    W's moyo?  If not, it is a no point move.
  Even if W HAD K14 here... B L14 is able to enter center.  B L14 K15 K15 M14    to prevent double atari, J14 K13 J13 J12... doesn't seem like W is able to
  stop B's advancing.

  If K14 is not the only Enterence, where to play? B M6 L6 L7 is a good    choice.  Not only W get smaller, but B gets bigger... B still HAD R11, PLS
  don't forget that stone.     What if W HAD M6(No K14 yet)?  Then, B has to draw a stright line between    H13 and M6.  Alone the line, there are points, thses are the limits that    invading a moyo(I will choose K10).
  Once more: Invade a moyo BEFORE it become considliate, NOT AFTER.]

  Comment on B's Comment:

  It is not a moyo any more, it is SOLID territory.

  And the rest are ending game moves.  No trick to improve ending game.
  Ending game part are not exciting because it dealing with real number.
  But it is the easiest part to improve of the game.  Just be patient and
  do the calculation, you will get better.];W[gf];B[he];W[ge]
