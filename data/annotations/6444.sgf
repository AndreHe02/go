C[Hi, I'm Yuki playing white in this game.  Even though I won, I'm still not sure about a few moves in the game.  Thanks for your time!]

[oc:A][oe:E]C[[Y\] Is this move necessary?  It seems to me a wasted ko threat, but I felt it's better if there is no ko because my opponent will need fill 3 liberties to kill this group.

No, simply play the A to D sequence.  The outcome is the same, but you have an extra ko threat and better aji.  For example, without the game move, E is forcing.]
;B[qe];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[rb];W[kc]LB[jc:A][md:D][ne:C][oe:B]
C[Extend to at least A.  Black has the option to force at B later.  Whether white responds at C or D, the game move is too close to white's power.]

;W[ho];B[gp];W[hp]LB[jo:A][lp:B]C[A gives white a better shape, cutting down the impact of black's pincer around B.]
;B[lp];W[gn]LB[el:A][hm:B]C[You lost a move here.  When black played at A, he covered his cut in sente.  Just jump to B to keep up the pressure.]

(;W[dk]C[[Y\] Where should this move be?  D7 E7 then H8?

Yes, that gives a better outcome.  Please see variation.];B[hl]
C[[Y\] I have a sick feeling in my stomache for losing this point.]
;W[po]LB[jn:A]C[This is unreasonable.  White needs to reinforce his lower side group.  It's true that even if black plays one more move he may not be able to kill white's group.  However, by attacking he can make profit during the process.  For example, black at A will seal white in and develop center power in sente.  That kind of move is too good for black.]
;B[nq]C[This move put even more pressure on white's group.  As you played out the joseki on the right side, you needed to think about the outcome and how it affected the left group.]

;W[ro];B[rr];W[qj]LB[rj:B][ol:C][ql:A]C[[Y\] Any other moves that's more elegant?

This helps black to solidify his upper right side.  Play at A.  Then B and C are miai.]

;B[rk];W[rl];B[sj];W[om]C[[Y\] It's gote is really not a good exchange for me.

You need to reinforce this group, otherwise black has a chance for a double attack.]
;B[gf]C[[Y\] Is this move the right timing?  I though black would go for the attachwith j6 or something.

Althougth the game move was big, attacking the lower white group was more urgent.  Black should be able to gain sente after the attack and come back here to defend.]
