C[i played black.Where can I improve with fighting? seemed liked I had a lot of chances to win the fights but fell short then lost badly in the end and should have resigned much sooner. Or were there chances to give up stones and get compensation.

P: Hi, I'm reviewing your game.   I'm only AGA 2d, so take my comments for what they are worth...  When you fight, keep in mind your objectives and do not neglect your own weaknesses. Most important, though, is picking the right fights; have a goal in mind, whether it is to settle a group or to make profit somewhere, and let that guide your moves.  Desparate fighting, however, is usually caused by mistakes made early in the game.  Here you had a successful first fight, but failure to recognize your own shape weaknesses coupled with a poor choice of direction of play led to the unfortunate later result.  Your instincts in the game seemed good--many of your comments are right on.  If you have any questions or comments feel free to track me down on KGS (I play as InExtremis).  Good luck with your games!

;W[co]
(;B[bq]LB[fp:A][fq:B][cq:C][bo:D]C[P: This is the first problem.  B3 is not to be found in my joseki book.  According to Kogo's, Black's choices here are (A) the small avalanche (somewhat complicated), (B) the large avalanche (very complicated), (C) is a steady move, and (D), the peaceful move.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[fp];B[gq];W[fq]C[P: White should probably keep this move in reserve.  This is because (1) it reduces white's liberties, (2) this move makes a move around J3 less severe, and (3) if Black comes back to fix this weakness right away it will be slow and gote--White can always play this move later.]
;B[fr];W[gp];B[hq];W[jq]C[P: What is White trying to do here?  Proverb: "Stay away from thickness."  This is not an attack, it is way too close to Black's safe position, and it invites Black to move into the center, negating White's thickness.  White should play something like D10, D11.]

(;B[ci]C[would just r10 be better?

P: I like this move. White has invested in a wall, and you hit the vital point.  However, White will play C13 and you will come under attack.  You have to be careful not to get shut in on the side.  The good thing about playing R10 would be that you would get both R10 and a second move elsewhere.]
;W[cg];B[cl];W[bn];B[bm]C[P: I would begin moving into the center immediately.  Also, there is no need to attach at B7.  Your goal at this point is NOT to kill the white wall.]
;W[bk]C[P: Now White guts Black's base.];B[ck];W[bj];B[cj];W[bi]
;B[ch];W[bh];B[dg]C[was this ok for black having him crawl along 2nd line?
P:  The important thing here is not the 1st line territory but the fact that the black stones now lack a base.  White's wall will again come into play with an attack on these stones.  Be careful with moves like D13; D13 pushes White from behind (bad), helping him to stabilize those stones and helping him to take more territory.]
;W[cf]
(;B[eh]C[I'm trying to play more of these kind of shape moves but they
don't come naturally and this did not turn out well.
Should I have played around f7 instead?
----
P: I wouldn't play F7.  It really wouldn't do much since it doesn't enable the d5 cut, and White can always connect his stones via B8, A7.
Here I would consider playing E13 or F13; I am not sure what the best shape is.
If you are intent on attacking (not necessarily bad), I think you should start with D6 to destroy eyeshape in sente.]
;W[ef];B[dn];W[do];B[fn]C[I ended up playing twice here but I thought it was sente
----
P: Why not just play R10?  The aji will still be there.  Remember, B8 allows White to connect underneath.]
;W[qi]C[now he gets the big point which was my next move :(
----
P: Doh!];B[io]C[P: Maybe play at J4 instead; that way the W stones get cut but B stays connected.]
;W[hp];B[ip];W[iq]C[looks like I should be favorite in this battle and it did turn
out ok but I'm not sure what the reality of this strange fight
was];B[in];W[bl];B[ap]
(;W[ao]C[P: Good move by White.  This ko is extremely difficult for black.  Why?  White has ko threats and Black does not.]
;B[bo];W[er];B[gr];W[bp];B[am]C[P: Not a ko threat (Black really doesn't have any).]
;W[aq]
(;B[ar]C[P: If you don't want to fight this ko play B2.];W[br]
;B[dr];W[es]C[P: Odd... White should save this for a threat]
;B[ap];W[hr];B[ir];W[aq];B[hs]C[P: Painful!];W[ds]C[P: Strange.  Capturing at A1 is sente.]
;B[ap]
(;W[cm]C[P: White should just fill the ko.  Black will have to end the ko, and then White can take this point.]
;B[bo]C[P: Now it is White who lacks ko threats!];W[dm];B[an]
;W[cn]C[P: Disaster for White.  However, Black has a couple weak groups in the area, so White may escape.]

(;B[en];W[el]C[now surely I can win this fight so what goes wrong?
----
P:  I already sense a little trouble brewing with the F6 stones, the J5 stones, and the C10 stones.  Black must manage three (!) groups while White has to snake his way out with just one.  Not an easy task for Black!  The move at G9 just doesn't work (as far as I can tell).  

The ideas behind your attack should be:
1) Be ready to give up useless stones.  When you don't need the F6 stones anymore don't bother defending them (merely 6 points).
2) Be ready to change targets.  The K3 stones are also ready to be attacked.  Killing the white chain would be fun, but there are many paths to profit.
3) Avoid creating weaknesses in your own shape.
4) Recognize the limitations of your own shape (J5, F6, D12 all lack eyes).]

(;B[gk]C[P: This is a little too ambitious.  How about G8 instead?]
;W[gl];B[gm];W[ej]
(;B[fj]C[P: Think about the safety of your C8 stones!  You are creating too many weak groups.  If your opponent makes a mistake, then you might win.  It's probably wise not to base a strategy on that hope. :)  Also, this violates the proverb of not touching the stones you are attacking.]
;W[fl];B[hl];W[ei]
(;B[fi]TR[fh][hk][hm]C[P: You now have many cutting points in your position... how sure are you of killing?]
;W[fh];B[fg];W[gh];B[eg];W[hk];B[hj];W[hm];B[il];W[gn]
(;B[im];W[hn]C[ok I lost F6 group but why can't i capture G12?]
;B[ih]C[P: Wrong side.  Protect the weak stones (C8 chain).]
;W[hi];B[ii];W[hg];B[ff];W[ee];B[hh];W[gg];B[ig]C[P: Wrong side!  Move from the weak side (C8 stones).]
;W[ge];B[fe]C[would H15 work better? or should I have given up my big group
early? Am I still in the game with my big wall and big moves
around p4? and c17?
----
P: Giving up the big group is a compelling idea and is Black's best hope.  However, it will be very difficult to win this game; white needs to make a few big mistakes.]
;W[he];B[fd];W[hc];B[gc];W[hb];B[dc]C[I'm trying for my two eyes
----
P: Difficult. :)];W[cc]C[P: Severe... black has only one eye now, right?  So why keep playing here?]

(;B[db];W[cb];B[ed];W[de];B[gb]C[would I have had a chance with k17 liberty race?
----
P: No.  The black group is surrounded and will require ~10 moves to capture.  If you have to start at K17 White will squirm away (beginning with something like K15) and get at least 10 liberties.]
;W[jc]
(;B[ek]C[bother! this does not seem to work so I wasted a move - I needed
somehow to have got an extra move on the outside with sente earlier.
Could I have made two eyes around e18?
----
P: I invite you to look at pg. 54 in James Davies' "Life and Death" (a must buy).  The section is titled "The door group is dead."  Things change if you make H18 or C18 a black stone, of course.]
;W[fk];B[gi];W[dk];B[ik];W[fa]C[now two eyes is unlikely
P: Not needed.  White is saying "this game is over."  A better move for white would be something like M17 to stabalize his only weakish group.]
;B[hd];W[id];B[ie]C[I misread the squeeze];W[if];B[hf];W[gf]
;B[gd]C[k15 better?
----
P:  Yes; either way white becomes strong.  G16 adds another stone to the dead group.]
;W[je];B[ha]C[Now I've fallen apart. Am I still in the game if I try to make
profit by m16 or p4 or some such?
----
P: Thrashing around with H19 is the surest way to lose.  At this point it is good to look at the score.  White has 80 points on the left and center.  Black has 17 points on the lower side and ~12 in the upper right for a total of ~30.  Black needs something big to happen!  P4 would be a possibility, but it looks bleak at this point. :(]
