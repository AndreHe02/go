AB[dd][dp][pd]C[Hi,
   I'm Anand and about 9 kyu on IGS. I played Black here. I'm weak in fighting and this is a good example where I get destroyed.

White played overplay after overplay invading everywhere and living everywhere. Any comments you have are welcome.

R: Hi!

R: My name is Roland. I'm about 4 kyu EGF. I'll prefix all my comments with R:.]
;W[pp];B[nq];W[nc];B[qf];W[cf];B[fc];W[cn];B[fq];W[dj];B[qn]
;W[jq]C[This can't be good.

R: I agree. It's a bit too far from O3 to really pressure it, and it doesn't have enough space for a 2-space extension on either side...]
;B[oo]C[R: Very good, seal white in and build outside stength.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[rn];B[rm];W[ro];B[pr];W[qr]
(;B[pq]C[This is a mistake I think.

R: I'm not so sure, this move gives black enormous influence to the outside... See variations for alternatives, but I think this move might be best.]
;W[qq];B[op]C[R: I think at this point you can tenuki, if you really want sente. But I like this move, black is very thick.]
;W[po];B[ql]LB[om:A]C[I end in gote. What did I do wrong?

R: Black is really strong on the outside, and white got just 7 or 8 points in the corner. That's just one point per move. That result is very good for black, even in gote. Perhaps the last move at A would be a little bit better, because the bottom side looks a little bit larger than the right side. But your move is good, too.

R: Even though I showed some alternatives, I don't think they are really better than the result in the game.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq];W[bq]
(;B[hq]C[This seems passive to me. Any options?

R: It's the right idea, driving the white stone towards your thickness. The problem with this move is that white has the option of simply jumping to the center, and then its hard to surround. See variations.

R: The general strategic idea here should be:
1) Surround the enemy stone. You don't need to kill it.
2) Drive the stone towards your strong position on the right.
3) Build influence towards the center. It will help to build something later on the top or right side.]
(;W[qi]C[Again overplay. Too close to my wall.

R: Yes.];B[lc];W[ne];B[of]SQ[nc][ne]TR[qi]C[Splitting the two groups

R: Very good.];W[bd]LB[id:A]C[Again tenuki. What to do? Is A (J16) better?

R: Definitely. The corner is just a few points territory. J16 is a multi-purpose move: It loosely connects the top-left group and the single M17 stone, strengthening both, and weakens the top white group.

R: Another idea would be a direct attack on the top group. See variation.]
(;B[cc];W[jd]TR[lc]C[White has weak groups all over the board. I seem to play logical moves yet get crushed.

R: But don't forget that black also has a weak stone at M17.]
(;B[le]C[R: It's the correct idea, play from the weak side. But see variation.]
;W[nf];B[og];W[oi];B[ng];W[lf]
(;B[kf]TR[lc][le]LB[ke:B][mg:A]C[Should be A, I think? Crucial shape point.

R: Yes, A is a crucial shape point, but I'm not sure if it's correct. Right now, the marked black stones are in trouble. See variation.

R: The problem with this move is that it leaves a cutting point at B, that you have to fix sooner or later. If you're going to play from this side, directly at B is better.]
;W[mg];B[lg]C[I played here to get N12 in sente to split off right side group

R: But you don't get N12 in sente. This move leaves too many cutting points...]
;W[mf];B[mh];W[kg];B[ke];W[lh];B[nh]SQ[kg][lf][lh][mf][mg][nc]
[ne][nf]TR[jd][oi][qi]C[Ok, Marked group is out in the open, but I have attack against two triangle groups. Yet, I seem to get crushed in both.

R: This result is very bad for black. White is out in the open, and black didn't really get that much compensation. Compare this to the end of the variation on move 36...]
;W[jg]
(;B[ie]C[R: Minor tactical comment: You usually want to play the other move to get out. See variations.]
(;W[hc];B[if];W[gd]
(;B[fe]C[Wrong direction? Maybe play from the weaker group?

R: In general, yes, you should play from the weaker group. But don't overestimate the strength of the corner. If it gets isolated, you still need the B17 move to be secure.

R: Also, this move is touching the white stones, and therefore strengthening them.

R: I have included a few variations, but I'm not really sure myself what is best here... Since in the game you could have captured white, perhaps that's best, but I probably missed some better moves for white ;)]

(;B[ka];W[eg];B[df]SQ[gg][gh]LB[ee:A][ef:B]C[Seemed to be the shape move. But what to do about the square stones?

R: No, that's very bad shape, because you need another move to connect after white plays D13. Either connect directly at A, or take a white liberty at B. Both produce an empty triangle, but sometimes bad shape is the only thing that works.

R: The important thing here is to count liberties. The white group has 4 liberties. That means when the square stones gain just one additional liberty, black can capture.]
;W[gi];B[fh];W[fi];B[eh]C[R: Note that this move would be sente if you had played E14 or E15 instead of D14. See variation.]
(;W[dg]
(;B[de];W[hh];B[ja]C[R: Black has only 2 liberties, and so white can just save these two stones and still survive. See variation for white.

R: Even if black had enough liberties, this move is bad because it doesn't take a liberty of the important white group. See the other variation.]
(;W[dh];B[ib];W[ei]SQ[oi][qi]C[Ok, I got destroyed on the top. But I have attack against square stones. So I try.

R: Correct, attacking the square stones is biggest right now.

R: This white move is very bad. White should just tenuki, the black stones are already captured for sure. White could just defend the square stones now, and have a won game.]
;B[mj]LB[ok:A]C[Might be wrong direction. Is A better to build moyo on the bottom?

R: No, this move is fine. You want white to run into your strength. A would do the opposite, then white would run towards the center, and there white is strong.]

(;B[sj];W[rf];B[ri]C[R: By now you should realize that you're in trouble. Save the corner (e.g. R15 or S15).]
;W[sg];B[sh];W[qe]C[This is a disaster. What did I do wrong?

R: You tried to kill too hard.

R: Yes, I showed a few variations where you could have killed at least in ko. But that's not the most important point. The most important point is to minimize your own risk.

R: Have a look at the variations that end in ko. What happens if you win the ko? The whole group is dead, you have won. What happens if you lose the ko? Nothing much. White lives with 3 or 4 points, and you get the corner.

R: Even if you didn't find a variation leading to ko (or maybe I'm wrong and it really is possible to live there unconditionally), it's still better to force white to live with just a few points. Black would be safe and have the corner. That would still be better than the result in the game, where white got life and the corner.]

(;B[jo]C[Ok, I try to attack the next weak group. Again, I get destroyed.

R: When playing this move, you should always have a plan what to do when white plays J4. I think here the knight move attack (J5) would be better, driving white towards the black wall. See variation.

R: Of course this is already a difficult situation. You are behind, and you pretty much have to kill white here to have a chance. Usually you don't want to get into that kind of situation in the first place.]

C[anand42 has resigned the game.

R: Overall, I think you played very well strategically. You often seem to have the correct idea of what's currently important and what should be done next.

R: I think your biggest mistake in this game was attacking without a clear goal. You often correctly identified the weak groups and tried to attack them, but you didn't gain much from the attacks.

R: When attacking, you always want to make sure you gain something from the attack. That could be building some territory, or just building strength to support another attack. But you should never try to kill during an attack.

R: If you try to kill too hard and fail, it's usually a desaster. Instead, you should attack in a way that you gain something no matter what happens. Let's say you attack some group and build a wall while doing so. If the attacked group dies, that's nice. But more often than not, it will live eventually. But even in that case, you got some profit by building a wall.]
