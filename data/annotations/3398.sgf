AB[pd][dp][pp]C[hello. my name is chris. thank you for taking the time to review this game.

i played black in this game on kgs. i think i played fairly well for my level (16k). generaly speaking: what should i work on next to improve?

Wenni: Hello Chris42, thanks for sending your game to the Go Teaching Ladder (GTL), I am looking forward to comment your game - there will be a little summary at the very end.

But please take anything I say with a grain of salt, a more experienced player than myself (currently around 9k only) may have completely different views.

That said: Let's start the review.];W[dd];B[qj];W[fq]
(;B[fp]C[Wenni: Rather unusual reaction for black against the white kakari. Please see variation for another option.]
;W[dq];B[cp];W[cq];B[hp];W[hr]
(;B[dj]C[Wenni: In situations like these, think 'Force before defending', black E3 looks too good to leave unplayed ;-) 

(Please see variation for one posiibility)];W[nq];B[oq]C[Wenni: This move (black P3) is seldom the optimal choice, since it strengthens the white O3 stone significantly - simply black R6 is often a more effective choice.]
;W[np]C[chris: how could b best secure the corner? would R6 work?

Wenni: Now that white O4 is played the bomb prove, but kind of slow option would be black R3.]

(;B[jq];W[qq];B[qp];W[or];B[on];W[kp];B[jp];W[kn];B[fc];W[ec]
;B[fd];W[df];B[jc]C[Wenni: Black K17 is a very good move - it has the correct extension to the black F17 wall (rule of thumb: height of the wall + 1 equals the secure distance to a single stone). 

Aditionally the black K17 stone together with the R10 and the Q16 stone forms the so-called 'double-wing formation' - a very desirable structure.]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[ch]
(;B[qc]C[Wenni: Maybe a kind of small move (Black R17), although it secures the last remaining corner.

Black should welcome a white invasion at R17 in order to wall white in and become strong on the outside. An alternative might be a move at P10 (please see variation for an impression).]
;W[cl]
(;B[cj]C[chris: i think now, that E9 would have been the better move ... what would you say?

Wenni: Please see the variation for an attempt to answer your question.]
;W[el];B[fj];W[eo];B[ep];W[bo]
(;B[fn]C[chris: here i guess i should have played b4 and stopped w from connecting.

Wenni: Yes indeed, black B4 seems to be the only move (please see the variation).]

[ab][ca][ba][aa]C[Wenni: It seems to be the right time to try to estimate the balance of territory and power.

1. White (x's)
- upper left corner: 22 points
- lower left corner: 19 points
- lower right corner: 11 points
- komi:  0.5 points
Altogether about 52.5 points, which seem to be sort of secure.

2. Black (squares)
Black has formed a huge territorial framework (Japanes: moyo) round the upper right corner extending towards the upper left and the lower right, which would be worth 54 points, if it would all be turning into real territory - which of course it won't.

Additonally black has built huge influence radiating into the center.

3. Strategic Summary
White is leading in actual territory while black is having lots of power which he can profit from if he uses it correctly. 

The remainder of the game will expect to see white attacking strongly in order to reduce black's territorial prospects - black will try to use his influence to create actual profit.]
;B[lo]C[Wenni: For situations like this there is one of many Go proverbs: 'Don't peep where you can cut.' Black M5 seems subtoptimal because it forces white to do what he wants anyway, which is connecting his stones. 

Still black P10 looks like an incredibly huge move.];W[ko];B[mn]
;W[op];B[oo];W[pq]
(;B[qn]C[Wenni: Black R6 is an excellent move - resulting in very good shape. Just imagine a white stone there (please see the variation for comparison).]
;W[hl];B[im];W[hj]C[chris: please have a look and comment the following variation. would there be a way for the b group to survive this?

Wenni: This is a question out of reach to answer at my skill level - there are simply too many options to consider. 

But one thing nevertheless: Would the black J7 stone have been played at H9 I am fairly convinced it might have effectively disconnected some of the white stones, therefore making the fight more complicated.

I refrain from putting variations because they would be way too complicated and there would be way too many opponent's options to consider.

Another way of answering your question would be:                 42

;B[go];W[gn];B[en];W[do];B[co];W[dn];B[dm]C[Wenni: Maybe giving atari from the left (black C6 instead of D7) might have been better.]
;W[cn];B[cm];W[bn];B[hn]C[Wenni: Maybe giving atari from above (black G7 instead of H6) might have been better.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[gl];B[lp];W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[ir]C[chris: ok. leaving on opening like this was a mistake. i thought i could kill the L2-7 group faster ...

Wenni: Looking back on last 10 moves: It seems black forces white where he can, leading to white being secure and black rather loose and threatened to die (at least partly, which happens in the game).

In close combat situations like these it is very important to seek ways to break out the of the encirclement rather than forcing the opponent. 

Therefore a learning goal may sound like 'How can I avoid forcing for the sake of forcing?' Which is a much more complicated question than it looks at first sight.]

[en][fn][fl][go]C[chris: how was my play here? should i have been more aggressive, to try and kill the group?

Wenni: I believe black played very effectively here using the combination of all of his stones in the area and was sucessful: The white O13 group barely lives with two or three points and black has solidified borders for the upper right corner, the territory round H15 and the territory round O8. 

It is often smart to chase enemy groups rather  to build territory and solidify borders than trying to kill them.

Remember the estimation of territory and power at move 39? Here it turns out that black has used his influence to actually create territory. Very good.

Let's try to count again:

1. White (x's)
- Upper left corner: 23 pts.
- lower left corner: 16 pts.
- lower right corner: 10 pts.
- lower left middle: 8 psts.
- large group round O13: 3 pts.
- prisoners on board:6 pts.
- prisoners off board: 3 pts.
- komi 0.5 pts.
Gives us a total of 69,5

2. Black (squares)
- Upper right corner: 13 pts.
- middle right: 19 pts.
- upper left middle: 24 pts.
- Prisoners off board: 0
A total of 56

3. Strategic summary
Black is behind in actual territory by 13+ points, but besides his group around H4 whose status is undecided yet all of his groups are secure and alive.

The remainder of the game will see some attempts by black to reduce white's territory in order to regain the lead.]

;B[la];W[of];B[ka];W[fl];B[ck];W[bl]C[Wenni: As promised a  little summary:

1. The both of you played a very good game, which I very much enjoyed to review.

2. You (Chris42) played some very good moves, i.e. the shape building moves at R6 and N10 and showed good strategic abilitites round the fight with the white N14 group.

3. The both of you profited from some tactical and strategic errors of your respective opponent, which roughly may have equalled out over the course of the game.

4. As areas of study for black I would suggest:
- Study tesuji, the book of James Davis is very good (Tesuji, Elemantary Go series, Volume three, by James Davies, Kiseido Publishing Company).
-  Think more in terms of: How can I keep my opponent's stones disconnected and my own ones connected rather than trying to defend would-be territory.
- Try to force your opponent before you defend - otherwise you get pushed around. (Hard to do against an opponent three stones stronger, I know ;-))

5. If you are really into studying you might want to take a look into 'Attack and Defense' by Akira Ishida and James Davies, Elementary Go series, Vol. 5, Kiseido.

I sincerely hope these comments help a bit - any feedback from yourself or another player is highly appreciated, enjoy our beautiful game and all the best to you

Best regards
Wenni]))
