C[Hi,  I am going to try to let you know my thinking along the way.  Please correct any of my misguided ideas, along with your regular comments.
--
Hi backpacker,

Thank you for sending me this game to review.  I have reviewed it in two passes - the first one shows my thoughts as I play though the game without the benefit of hindsight and the second is more careful with assistance from checking in books, etc.  The idea is that the first pass shows differences in thinking while the second picks up mistakes.

Something I have to warn you is that while I am a few stones stronger than you, I have literally not played a single game of internet go for almost two years - only tournament play and occasionally beating up CrazyStone.  So I am extremely rusty with the agressive overplays common on the internet.  I will do my best.
--
And hi again, I've had a few days to think over this game and my comments now.  You chose a few strategies which I wouldn't have and that makes it a little tricky for me; I'm not strong enough to know whether your strategy is a mistake or just not my personal style so I have noted where these choices don't match mine and you'll need to be careful around my comments there.

Overall there were a couple instances where you played yose moves when I thought it was too early, a couple instances where you chose a direction of play I wouldn't have, and one where you played a lower value yose sequence.  I believe changing any one of those would have been enough to win the game.]
;B[po];W[dq];B[pe];W[dc];B[pj]C[I have been trying this lately.  I know its not common, but hope to try this more.
--
I do not think I would like to play it, I would prefer to be white here.  To me the 4th line gives influence but the tight placement compared to to san-ren-sei is territory focussed.  The structure is very easy to reduce with both the 3-3 and 3-4 points open so there is no urgency for white to reduce - white can wait to see if 3-3 or 3-4 is better in the global context.  

I wouldn't read too much into it being against my personal style.  I'm not saying it's bad.]
;W[jp];B[ce];W[cg]C[--
I would have chosen a looser pincer as white here to aim at pulling back to C6 later.]
;B[ed]C[--
I would have chosen the one-space jump as black here.  This leads to the fairly natural joseki in the variation which I prefer for white here.]
(;W[ec];B[fd];W[gc];B[cc];W[db]C[--
This feels like a trick play.  White's shape feels so inefficient that you can comfortably spend the next move defending and come out happy]
(;B[dd];W[gd];B[ge];W[id];B[he];W[jc];B[cj]C[--
I would also have been  tempted by the slow C18 which would leave you settled and ready to attack anywhere.]
;W[cn];B[ei]C[--
I would play D12 instead to destroy as much of C13's aji as possible.  To me this move does not erase enough of C13 and so will cause problems later.  For instance how do you respond if white later F12? Or B10?]
;W[pc]C[--
I would have approached on the lower side because K17 is well settled and with Q15 there isn't that much opportunity for expansion]
(;B[nd]C[--
I would have played R17 instead.  How will you use the central moyo?]
(;W[nc]C[--
I would have played R15 and settled happily in the corner];B[md]
(;W[mc];B[ld];W[kb]C[--
Both of your play is consistant - you valuing the moyo and white valuing the top side, I just think the alternative would have been better.]
;B[je];W[nj]C[--
There are many moves white could have done here, this seems as good as anything]
;B[pl];W[pi]C[--
White needs to be careful to make sabaki, this might be an overplay with the top so strong and settled.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[qe]C[--
Right, you played there as I would have, I think this sequence favours you.]
;B[qf];W[pf]C[I think I should take the corner here now that he has cross cut.  Originally I was going to attack Q11 and P11.
--
I would play P15 here, I think you're fine.  I do not think the corner is as valuable as killing P11]
(;B[qd];W[re];B[pd];W[qg];B[qc]C[--
I think this result is very disappointing for you.  You regained about 10 points in the corner so perhaps 25 points benefit while losing around 40 points on the side.]
;W[of];B[oc]C[--
This is big, but it's yose.  The lower side is more urgent.]
;W[qj]C[--
R10 seems a little strange to me, helping you to settle Q8]
;B[qk];W[qi]C[--
(second play through)
Ok, let's stop and evaluate at this point.  You now have very few points of absolute territory but quite a lot of near territory.  S16 and P18 are both almost sente for you and so you should end up with 12 or so in the corner.  While white can take away virtually anything on the lower right, doing so will make other things bigger and put K4 in trouble so you should get something reasonable there.  Finally the C13 area looks promising though it really feels like it needs another stone to me.

By contrast white has quite a few certain points - 14 on the top and 15 or so on the right, but apart from the lower left white has very little potential for expansion.

Overall then the game feels fine for you at this point.  If you can turn the lower right into solid points, or do the same around C13, then you should be well ahead on territory and white's lower left is not much bigger than your lower right.

So I would now play something like Q3 - it feels better to me than say H11]
;B[mj]C[--
I don't understand this move. What is your plan?];W[nk];B[nh]
C[WIth this extension I have a center framework going.
--
Ok, that answers my question on N10.  I wouldn't have chosen that strategy but I can see it now.  My concern with it is that the centre won't be of much use in attacking this game so it's all about points and it isn't that big here - maybe M16 to N10 - 70 or so.  For you to hold onto it you'd have to defend against quite a few moves (e.g. R7, L10, N14) which would give white a lot of points elsehwere.]
;W[mf]C[--
I would not have played this yet as white, it's a good refutation of your strategy but refuting it does not feel urgent - I would have approached Q5.]
;B[lg];W[ie];B[if];W[jf]C[--
All these moves by white feel ok, but I do not see the urgency in playing them.]
;B[jd];W[ic];B[lf];W[ig]C[--
It feels too early for white to be playing this.  There is a lot of bad aji for black and it isn't obvious what the best move is so I would play elsewhere until it is more obvious.]
;B[hf];W[lj];B[mk];W[ij];B[mm]C[So now I am switching to profit on the right side, since he spent his moves in the middle.  I would have a hard time attacking in the center.
--
Good, I agree completely, I think white missed here.

This feels like a very different position to after R11 but it still seems reasonable to me.]
;W[gi];B[fh]C[--
I'd be quite happy with this exchange as black, now C13's aji is almost gone so you can treat that area as territory.  That gives over 60 points to you while white has half this.  White does have both sente and the nice framework on the lower left while you have a little profit to make attacking J10 etc and the lower right.]
;W[pq]C[--
This sequence is really important.  If you can get a bit of territory here while protecting the right side in sente and then reduce the lower left framework then you should win.]
;B[oq]C[--
This is also where I would have played];W[or];B[nq]C[I want to make sure he does not connectd Q3 to K4.
--
To me that is not so important as K4 can connect in many directions, I would have played P4]
;W[nr]C[--
Here I would R3]
(;B[mq];W[pp];B[qo]C[--
I would have played P5 because making P3 weak effectively makes K4 stronger.]
(;W[rq];B[mr];W[op];B[mo];W[oo];B[on]
(;W[rp]C[--
This seems slow to me, I cannot read out a kill if it is omitted]
;B[hp]C[Trying to use my thickness to go to the next open area of the board.
--
I quite like it.  White's stones in the centre are still unsettled so running to them feels uncomfortable for white]
;W[lp];B[no];W[jn]
(;B[ep]C[--
I would not have played this, I would have simply jumped to H6.  The reason is that C4 is big and I don't think making H4 strong is worth it.]
;W[dp];B[eo];W[jl];B[iq];W[cl]C[--
Ok, I think this all flowed fairly naturally from your E4 and I don't especially like it for you.  Now the lower left is big and white is stable everywhere except the central group.  Killing the central group looks too ambitious so I think you're no longer winning.  

White has:

10 odd in the lower right, 15 odd in the lower left, a couple in the centre, 15 odd at the top, 10 odd on the right for 50 plus komi.  

Black has: 15 in the upper right, 12 odd on the right, 35 odd on the left.  So I would have said black has slightly more points but white has a number of good reducing moves (F2, R7, C18 etc), while black has very few.]
;B[jq]C[Now I can see that all groups are alive across the board, except maybe the center white stones.   I looked at peeking at J7 or j5 here, but I delayed, and then he played first in the center.
--
Right, this is the start of yose];W[ro];B[rn]C[--
I would attack the central group instead, it's too hard to ignore. Then you can come back here]
;W[bj]C[Ok, here is a mistake of his.  I can capture this stone.
--
Yes, with the other aji settled this is an overplay.];B[bk]
;W[ck];B[bi];W[dj];B[ci];W[bl]C[--
Mistake];B[aj]C[--
This capture is small yose, I would attack the central group first.  Also C18 or E3 are both considerably bigger.]
;W[cb]C[very big. Sorry that I could not play this.
--
You can get it, you just have to give up other things like S6.]
(;B[bc];W[fr];B[gq]C[--
I feel white has won now, all it takes is a little care around the central group.]
;W[hn]C[Now he protects the center and he actually gets 12 pts in the center which surprised me.
--
Very few further comments after this - white is ahead with just simple yose to go and you both played that fine.]
;B[em];W[fn];B[en];W[fm];B[el];W[gk];B[dk];W[ln]C[I think M6 was slow, because it does not threaten to cut if I take D10.
