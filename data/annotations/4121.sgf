AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[xed_over: thanks for reviewing our game.  For myself, I think most of my trouble is still in the opening game, especially with handicap games. The rest of this game I should have lost due to a huge mistake later that we both missed.

Ben: yes, thanks for reviewing.  I think my weakness is also in the game opening.  I think i play much different when i have some handicap stones... i think i get overconfidant.  I also am not too used to making corner enclosures from the 4-4 point.  when i play even games i usually use the 3-5 enclosure.

Kim:  I'll see what I can do to help you guys out with the openning.  I've struggled enough with openings myself, that I'm hoping I'll be able to provide some insight into how to improve yours.

One thing that usually serves me pretty well in making my way through the opening is to constantly ask myself:  If I play here, what sort of options will it open up for my opponent, and who will be in better shape at the end of the sequence?  I guess it's rather similar to reading ahead in any other part of the game, you just have to look as far into the future as far as you can.

I noticed that you guys played this on DGS.  If you don't already, try taking advantage of all the time you get for you moves there by seeing how far ahead you can read.]
PL[W];W[nc];B[qf]
(;W[fc]LB[kc:D][cf:A][qn:C][fq:B]C[xed_over: A, B or C would have been better I think, otherwise I allow my opponent to squeeze me into a smaller base.

Kim: The problem I see with F17 is that it makes it too tempting for black to find a way to jump in between it and O17 at some point.  Basically, any black stone between the two is going to leave at least one of them very weak.  Later on you mention that you're okay with sacrificing one of these stones, but in a handicap game, you need to make even more than usually, and loosing a stone so early is going to help black a lot more than it helps you.

See the variations for my thoughts on the other possiblities that you suggested and the reasoning behind my own suggestion, D.]

(;B[hc]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[Ben: I think i started fighting too early.  Isn't A or B  the standard reply?

Kim:  A and B are both good standard replies when considering  only the sittuation that you have in the corner, and it's usually a good idea for black to focus on calmly building up potential territory rather than starting fights in a handicap game.  Even considering the rest of the board, they are still nice strong moves.  Consider the variation I show on this move for more comments on why such a move would work well for black.

However, I think the sittuation on the right opens up the other possibilites a little more.  In this case, I think a little aggression can be justified if black really wants to fight.]

(;W[cc]C[xed_over: starting a fight too early. I need to establish a better base first.

Kim:  You might have gotten the base you needed by playing at L17 earlier, but after black's pincer, you have to do some fighting.  As I showed in my variation on this move, a one point jump might have lead to some fighting, but you might have used that fighting to your advantage.

With this move, white is practically asking black to cut him into three groups and black probably should have attacked with D17 imediately.  (See variation)]

(;B[kc];W[ne]C[xed_over: again, there are bigger moves on the board still (even if I lose this stone)

Kim:  There may be some big moves on the board, but I think taking care of the stones you already have on the board is a good idea at this point.]
;B[pi];W[fq];B[dn];W[ip];B[mq];W[lp]C[Kim:  Attacking this black stone isn't a good idea at this point in the game.  White doesn't gain much teritory from this move and black gets an excuse to get stronger.  Consider the left side of the board instead.]

(;B[no]LB[mp:A]C[Kim:  This seems weak and a little wasteful.  I think A would work better]

(;W[ck]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[xed_over: perhaps A or B wouldhave been better, maybe allowing me to get a larger base on the side.

Kim:  I like your idea of playing more near the top of the board, although I'm really not sure what the best spot to play in would be.  Just keep in mind that going straight for a big base after A or B is going to leave you with holes for black to attack as my continuation of your variation shows.]
;B[cf];W[dc];B[ci];W[cd]C[xed_over: too slow. I don't know what I was thinking. So far Ben has been playing very solidly, establishing a very nice base for himself.

Kim:  I'm not sure what you were thinking either, but I'd say it'd be better to worry about C9 a little.]
;B[de];W[ek];B[ei];W[fj]
(;B[fe];W[gd];B[hd]LB[he:B][ie:A]C[Ben: maybe A or B?

Kim:  That's a hard call to make,  I don't think there's anything you can do to stop white from cutting your groups at this point.  I think the place to do something differently would have been your previous move (move 24).

From here I like B.  White could get dangerous if he decides to keep pushing, but I think black will be able to keep him confined to the corner, even if he does get cut.  But the move you made has strong points in that it keeps white away from his stones at O17 and O15.]
;W[ge];B[le]
(;W[pc]LB[pb:A]C[xed_over: perhaps A is better

Kim:  You could be right.  I've been playing around with variations to see if black can kill white after either move.  I haven't been able to come up with anything conclusive.  But, I think A would have been sente and the move you played should have been gote.  After white left to invade, if black had gotten back to the corner first of managed to cut white off from the center, white probably should have died in the corner.  I'll explain a little more in a few moves.]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[mb]LB[qb:A]C[Ben: A perhaps?

Kim:  No, I think the move you played was bigger in terms of minimizing white's eyespace while gaining some teritory for yourself.]
;W[qb];B[rd];W[rc];B[qd];W[qn]C[xed_over: the side was getting too big for black. I needed to probe and see if I could successfully invade

Kim:  I think you should have stayed in the corner one move longer.  (See my variation for what black might have done had he returned there first.)

But, invading was a good idea, your corner survived anyway, so no loss.  Besides, eventually your attempt did help when you were going for that corner.  But, I think you could have gotten more out of it had you played a few stones higher.

Here you give black plenty of ways to approach and close you in.  The next time you're looking for a spot to invade,  Try to have two possible ways to make life so when your opponent denies you one, you can go for the other.]

(;B[ql];W[om];B[ol];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm];B[ml];W[mg];B[mi]LB[rb:B]
[nf:A]C[Kim:  Black can probably afford to be much more agressive than this.  Attempting to cut at A or destroying an eye with B would both be good moves about now.]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[hf];W[hg]C[xed_over: I'm thinking, if he separates me from my corner (which I think is rather safe at this point), then I'll try to establish something in the center.

Kim:  Your corner certainly is safe at this point.];B[ig];W[if]
;B[hh];W[he];B[gg];W[gf]
(;B[ie]LB[fh:A]C[xed_over: I wonder if A would have been better for Ben here, keeping me separated from the center, and keeping black's groups better connected.

Ben: yes, A does look better... especially with the threat i make in a few moves.]
;W[hg];B[lm]C[xed_over: ouch... nice threat

Ben: this was the biggest ko threat i could find.  I am not that good with finding them.  are there any others i could have used?]
;W[gh]C[xed_over: But I decided to trade my stones on the right for connections and influence in the center. The right side is huge, but I guess I'm still thinking I can save those stones.]
;B[ln]C[xed_over: ouch, now you're making me think I've made a wrong decision. But still I can't help felling like I got the better trade (if I can keep someting alive in the lower right corner).

Ben: now i have to really fight to make sure you don't live in the corner.]

(;W[oo]LB[pm:1][qp:B][rp:A][qq:2]C[xed_over: Probably the wrong thing to do. I guess now that A or B might have been better, though that would have probably meant a sure sacrifice of my 3 stones with a black play at 1 (after white A or B). But then white 2 and I would have had the corner.]

Kim:  Definitely.  Black can still do a lot of damage if he can keep white's corner group cut off, and A will help do that.]
;W[kf];B[kd]C[Kim:  I don't think black needs this move.];W[lh]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[oh];W[li];B[lk];W[hi];B[jj]C[Ben: dissapointed in my loss at H14, i decided to head for the center.

Kim:  Cutting your losses is a good idea, but the center usually isn't all that big.  When you decide that it's time to reevaluate you position, try taking a broader look at the board as a whole.  I'd say that the bottom left hand corner of the board looks rather neglected at the moment, so I'd consider something there.]

(;B[dr]LB[am:A]C[xed_over: the ko at A would have saved your groups and the corner -- and I think I would have had to resign after this :)

(;B[kr]C[Ben: I wasn't sure if i could make life out here.  I knew it would be hard.  maybe i should have sacrificed those stones.  See variation.

Kim:  Tough call.  You didn't have much hope of giivng that group like on it's own.  But, given the way things progressed, it looks like you actually could have used the extra liberties you got for that group to kill white's corner.

Be sure to check the end of your variation to see that you could actually have killed white with a ko.]

Basically, I think I'd avoid the upper right entirely until you've done something to strengthen O17.

Black usually isn't going to want to start complex fighting with a pincer at B, but it's a good habit to consder such possibilities.  White's best response from there would probably be a one point jump to the center.  Black will then be able to take A, but from there attacking B should work out well for A.

No matter where black goes, white won't have any weak groups to worry about and will be able to pick among the big moves that black leaves for him.

Depending on black's next move, moves around A, B, and C could all work well for white.  I suggest playing around with similar moves in future handicap games to see how you like them.]
