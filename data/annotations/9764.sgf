C[Hello, to be honest I have no idea how I could win this game. My attacking didn't seem to work very well and I had a lot of misreads...

CC: this was an interesting game. you were doing well in the opening - then a couple misreads and you fell behind quite a bit - but then you made a miraculous invasion and pull off the upset. entertaining!

Agreed your attacking didn't work well. My advice would be to relax. you don't always have to attack right away - in this game you would have been better off playing more calmly and waiting for a better oportunity to attack. (see comments for more about that). You can think about it this way if your opponent spends a move just to secure one of his groups you get 2 moves making points - so that is your profit! :)]

;W[on]LB[oc:D][od:C][hq:B][lq:A]C[CC: this is a mistake. 

C or D enclosure would be bigger. you should aim to invade around A or B later. The move you played is just kind of slow... it is not a bad move. it is just that there are other bigger places]
;B[dq];W[cq];B[dr];W[cr];B[ep];W[do]C[CC: this was a good deal for white - corner is solid and pretty big. still invasions in the bottom so B should have not played this way]

(;B[pm]LB[ql:A][rn:B]C[this move confused me, shouldn't that be a bad move/sequence playing next to white's strong position?

CC: this move is played when B wants to start a ko - in this case it would probably be better for black to just play at B]

;W[nn]C[Was this move too slow? But I thought it is important to keep a weak group seperated, but because I did this black was able to secure more territory on the bottom.

CC: yes this is a good move - if b goes here his position is too good.]
;B[lp]C[CC: B decides to take the points and hopes you can't make anything of attacking.

B has about 50 - you have about 50(+) -- but b has two weak groups and all your groups are perfectly strong. So you are doing very well!]

Now I am attacking a group, but I don't really see any profit that is coming from that... Is there any profitable way of handling this situation?

CC: this move looks good. b is in a tough spot.];B[mo]C[CC: this is not a good move - this poke at a cutting point -- which in general should be avoided]

(;W[lk];B[lj];W[mj]C[Now I know, that this cut was a mistake

CC: yes, but it is not so bad because B group in top right is weak and you get nice thickness to attack it...]
