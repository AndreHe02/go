(;B[ef]LB[cc:F][cd:B][dd:E][de:A][ee:D][eg:C]C[How should I respond/prevent this move?

First, there is no way to prevent this move, in this situation, it's quite normal that black gets sente. Usually, black plays at A or B. Knowing this, you should notice that A and this E14 move are very similar in nature (they intend to block C14 by using the fact that it's low) and so, it's reasonnable to assume that E14 is indeed a possible move, but with more weaknesses than A.

When you are faced with a novel play, you shoud first answer those 2 questions :

1) Does he gain much more than if he played the normal move ?
2) Are there any obvious weaknesses? 

Here, the answer is 1) not clear, 2) not really.

So, just like many other "novel plays" in Go, there is not much to do beside way and see.

To "prove" 1), I am going to show you the normal joseki and one possible similar variation with this E14 and we'll compare.  We'll look at C, D, E, F and your move, B.

The variation for B is later in the SGF.]

(;W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[fi];W[ck]C[Compare to the previous variation, is it better or worse ?

White seems to have a bit more territory and black seems to have a bit more weaknesses, but the wall is closer to K16 so it's harder to invade. I think that overall, this is close to being even, even if I don't like white so much (the shape isn't very pretty)
