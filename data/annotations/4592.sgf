C[Hello reveiwer.. First of all, thanks for your time, and I hope You can correct some of my many errors in this game, and That you might even learn something! I have messages along the way, but if you see anything i could've done better, just tell me, thanks.

> Hi, you're very welcome 8-). I have preceded my comments with '>' so you can see them easily. I have commented both sides, so you can learn from the other guy's mistakes as well 8-).

I you don't understand a term I used, you can look it up at senseis.xmp.net .

Some general comments here, the others are in the game.

You both started to fight quite early while the board was still empty. It is much easier to make territory with a stone far away from everything than by fighting to the last local point.

You made empty threats that could be left for ko fights.

Too many cutting points left behind. 

So, leave fewer cutting points and try to see if you can find a bigger move than the one you're about to make locally.

If you have any questions, you can reach me at gbohus@yahoo.com]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[cf];W[ch];B[df]C[> This move doesn't seem to be a joseki, it's probably too solid. (A useful tool for studying joseki is Kogo's Joseki dictonary. You can find it on the net.)]

;W[cc];B[bd];W[dc]C[> W is overly cautious here. B can't cut.]
;B[ee];W[fe];B[ed]C[> A useless threat. It doesn't help you and it's easy to defend, so there is no point in doing this now. You can keep these for later as ko threats.]
;W[ec];B[ef]C[> There is no need for this. E14 and D15 are miai (interchangeable).]

;B[ag];W[fh];B[cb]C[> Too small again, this is an endgame move. Apart from the moves I marked earlier, there are two other which are very big now: L17 and D7 are both extensions that neutralize a lot of white's influence.]

(;B[mq]LB[mq:A][nr:B]C[> You are pushing white against your weak corner. If you come from the other direction (see variaton) you are using your stone at O4 to threaten white and you take the corner. O4 will be lost of course but it will have done its duty 8-).

Playing like this, you are making the white stone stronger while your own stones are quite weak.]
;W[pq]C[and the screw up.. ^^'];B[qf]C[> Oops? Did you give up all those stones in the bottom? O2 makes a ponnuki, a fairly strong shape and if white wants the corner, it needs one more move.]
;W[or]C[> Black is ruined here.];B[no]C[> It is not a good idea to play close to strength, especially that there is still so much empty space. Even if you make these stones live, you will pay a price in some way. White will get a lot of territory or influence.]
