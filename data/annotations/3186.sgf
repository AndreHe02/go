C[Dear Reviewer,

Please grade this game for white.  While both players are nominally the same grade, hence the even game, I can't come close to flustering the other player, let alone winning.

I am submitting this game for review because I honestly have no clue where and how I lost.

Andrew

DRS: For what it's worth, egeus has been on a winning streak.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fc]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[DRS: This is the first move that doesn't appear in a pro game.

I did a kombillo search for the top half of the board.  It showed W playing at A or B more commonly than making a kakari.  I think you probably want to respond locally, even though Black probably should have made a shimari instead of playing kakari against your 4-4.  In other words, I think B played a less than ideal move, but I don't think I, or the pros, would commonly punish that.]
;W[oq];B[pn]LB[kq:A][lq:B]C[DRS: I did a kombillo search on the bottom half of the board.  It shows White playing A or B most commonly.]
;W[lp];B[cf];W[ee]LB[df:A][fd:B]C[DRS: I did a kombillo search on the upper left corner.  It showed White playing the attachments more often than this move, though this is the sort of move I believe my teacher would prefer because it doesn't attach a weak stone.]
;B[ic]LB[eb:A]C[The upper left closely resembles the Zhou Lanyu - Zhou Donghou game of 1650~.  It might be worth trying to find it.  White starts with A.]
;W[cc]C[This splits a strong group from a group that is about to become strong - compared to the three white stones, at least.  If Black wants to go for C17, I'd welcome that.]
;B[ci];W[ck]LB[qe:A][qi:B][qh:C]C[Was this extension weak or ill-advised?  Certainly the stone was of no use later, not to me anyway.

DRS: It does constrict the two black stones, however  A, B and C are probably bigger.  Usually we want to play a kakari or shimari first, then into the widest area.]
;B[ei];W[qh];B[qe];W[qk];B[pq];W[rn]LB[op:A]C[DRS: A feels natural here.]
;B[qj]C[This move bothered me, both in the game and emotionally.  Can I take this stone from the outside and smother it?  My stone on C9, approaching his two space extension, bumped into strength and fell back in ribbons later on.  My two space extension, meanwhile, is of so-little account that he played in the middle of it.

DRS: I think if you try to go after this stone from the outside, you'd probably best plan to let Black escape and take outside influence in exchange.]
;W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[pk];W[pl];B[ql];W[rk];B[ol]C[DRS: How about taking a ponnuki?]

(;W[kc];B[mc]C[Having allowed him to get that fantastic wall on the right there, I had to invade, did I not?  The invasion lived, but doesn't seem to won me, or cost him, much.]

;W[kd];B[mi];W[mh];B[cn];W[co]LB[bp:A][dn:B]C[DRS: This says "please stand up and strengthen yourself".  Locally, I'd probably try A or B.]
;B[dn];W[ek]C[A foolish series of moves.  My stone has nowhere to run to.  What ought I to have done here?]

;B[eb];W[hb];B[hc];W[gb];B[gc]LB[fb:A]C[DRS: If you want to play on the right, how about A?]

(;W[ib];B[dc]C[I thought I had him here.  I cannot see much of an alternative to any of the moves I made.  Yet he lives and I die.]

Thank you very much.
