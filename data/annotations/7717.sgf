;B[dc]C[Hi there. My name is Ilan Keshet, I am currently 5k on KGS. I do lots of reviews there as well.]
(;W[pd]LB[dp:A]TR[dc]C[Here, im not saying this is a bad move, However by putting the stone here, you are facing the closed side blacks komoku. Making it much harder to approach. However this is totally fine.   I would play at A]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[np]C[High approach towards a hoshi point is generally regarded as not so good.]
(;W[qn]LB[pn:A]C[This is a possible move, However the correct joseki is at A. However R6 is going more for territory rather than influence / attacking. Not a problem.]
;B[pq];W[qq];B[oq];W[qr];B[jq]SQ[qr]C[Good to see you know correct joseki!]
(;W[ep]LB[de:A]C[I find this move not a good approach. Approaching at E4 will get violently attacked with D6 or as in the game E3. it is possible in this case to approach from the wrong direction in order to press black down.

However I recommend just played at A. and maybe later come back to reduce black



This E4 approach caused extreme grief for the rest of the game, and lost many points.]
;B[eq]C[Good idea to attack since u have K3 stone];W[fq];B[dq]
(;W[fn];B[cn]C[Yes this is very unfortunate result and quite a disaster. This exchange has ended up letting black take an easy corner, and w now has a very weak group.]
;W[jo]TR[cn][dq][eq]SQ[fn][ep]C[too early?


-- Answer: Its hard for me to say what to do here. Its not a good situation at all. At least this way you are trying to strengthen yourself outside, however, you still are not making any territory and are weak. 

Black was able to play these 3 moves, which make at least 15 points in the corner, while white played 3 moves which didn't make any territory.]
;B[de]TR[dc]C[Important to note. That this shape does not fully secure the corner.]
(;W[jc]C[Good move. Stops the explaintion of the shimari towards O17]
;B[qf];W[qi];B[nc]LB[nd:C][oe:A][pf:B]C[A,B,C are playable moves depending on what u want.]
(;W[qc]LB[oe:A]C[bad direction?

Yes, here you are after A, you get trapped into the corner, and you are still not alive. You want to avoid doing this at all cost.]
;B[of]LB[nd:A]C[Here I think that P14 seems like w can escape via the top. I would try to keep black seperated, and therefore weaker. I would probably jump out at A, and Lean on the O17 stone, and then come back and attack the P14 stone]
(;W[gc]C[I];B[ne]LB[ob:B][re:A]C[Here you have to realize that the corner is still not alive. I would try and save it with A or B.  However, Im not certain if it can be saved at this point.  If you try to live here, black will get even stronger outside, and might be able to counter attack the R11 stone.]
;W[oj]TR[qi][qn]C[this P10 move to me seems to make a bad shape.   It is not really increasing your territory by much, nor is it securing your territory. Instead, you can play like C13 or a move in that area right away]
;B[je]LB[lc:B][ge:A]C[i don't like this move. W has even 2 moves to respond to it.

W can jump out at A, or make life with B

This move for black is not making territory, nor is it connected to O15, so it leaves aji behind]
;W[lc]C[w decidices to happily live];B[le]LB[md:A]C[black has a cutting point at A now]
;W[ci];B[cg];W[cl];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr]TR[fq]C[Do you think that F3 is an important stone? What good is it doing for you? Here i would give it up, and play H4 to fix my shape with K5]
(;W[fp];B[hq];W[hp];B[pl];W[om]CR[qp]TR[pj]SQ[ok][ol][pm]C[Very dangerous. Lots of aji around, and u are trying to kill just a stone. The initial bad shape is coming back to haunt you =)]
;B[ol];W[nl];B[nk];W[ok];B[nm];W[ml];B[pm];W[on];B[pn];W[nn]
;B[po];W[qo];B[oo];W[mj];B[ge]C[Another black move that makes very little territory. black should instead try to kill the top right corner]
(;W[id]SQ[ge][je]C[I feel that this exchange just strengthens black. If you are afraid of life, you can simply just cut directly via N16]
;B[ie];W[mn];B[lp];W[fh]LB[dh:B][hh:C][dm:A]C[This move may seem big. But really is not big. Black can still jump it with C6, or C13 or K15

This move makes close to 0 points if black plays C here];B[jj]
LB[jh:A]TR[fh][mj][ml][mn][jo]C[This move... is deep. You might try to play the K12 cap. And try to kill. You are very strong all around

Learning to play and kill with A takes practice. ..   

If you can't do such a thing to fight back when a person plays so deep into your moyo, you shouldn't build moyos with these types of moves.]
;W[mq]C[stupid misreading :/];B[mp];W[qp];B[op]
(;W[kf];B[ke];W[jh]C[Aha u did do the cap.however u still are not super strong all around. It will not be easy.]

C[Which of your stones here are weaker. The square stones, or the triangled stones. ?]
(;W[li]C[By you playing M11 u are leaving a potenial cutting point/weakness at L11/L12 area.]

It sems for me that I have not made any big mistake, anyway some daubty points I've marked
I think that it's good example to get more general fedback about direction of play or something else that I miss...
I'm stuck at 11kyu and would be great to see what is the problem.
Thx in advance for good advice

PS Would be great to have also comments for black, who was my student some time ago and now is defeating me making good progress.]
