C[Hello dear reviewer,

I'm black in this game and white only have a 0.5 komi

I would like you to light my way in this game. I didn't feel greatly behind nor ahead, but I would like to know if my choices are right ? Should I have invade later or maybe reduce only ? Bottom side is bigger than the upper ?

Well, I'm still trying to improve on this point, as it is my biggest difficulty (after a few moves, my mind disconnects and I don't analyze enough... Maybe do you have a solution for this ?)

Could you help me progress ? I'm going to review myself this game for both side, but a greater eye is still the best to improve and point out mistakes !

Thanks you for all and sorry to add you more work.

dv: Hi, I'm Dieter, a 2d from Belgium. The game gives the impression of being played with a blitz mindset, despite the apparent time setting of 50 minutes each. I'll try to highlight a few things which can be of help. Don't hesitate to come back for more, although playing another game may be more valuable.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[mp];B[jq]C[I've been trying this move a lot and result where pretty good most of the time. Any point of view on this ? I didn't find any pro player who have tried this, so maybe I should stop it ?

dv: I don't think this choice is decisively bad. Given the further development of the game I suggest not to explore this opening from a pro game base perspective. There are more important points to stress.]

(;W[pb];B[qc];W[hc];B[lc]LB[bb:A][nm:B][cn:C]C[dv: This looks very greedy. Black is doing ok in this game and stabilizing the advantage at A or B is better than invading here.

If you need to deny White's development, C has much more potential.]

dv: correct];W[na];B[if];W[ma];B[fd];W[gc];B[df]C[dv: Sharp but good I think. You need to fight a bit now to make up for the loss and this is a good place.]

(;B[bg]LB[bd:A]C[wasted move no? I've played too quickly without reading. and now I don't find why I have defended here when I read....

;W[mi];B[rr]LB[qb:A]C[Too early ?

;W[hi];B[gh]LB[bd:A][pf:B]C[dv: here too, the aji of A has gone, and Black has a won game, except if White can attack the group at B, which seems unlikely.

From here on, White merely plays endgame which is not enough. It's as if White isn't even trying.

End of commentary.

Summary:

1. You played more solidly than your opponent, who had a tendency of leaving the battle front early.
2. Given that, you could have taken time to finish off the aji in the upper left and lower right.
3. Given your advantage, invading the top was not needed and rash.
4. In the end, your opponent helped you solving the aji lying about, so all you had to do was accept victory, which you did very well. Many players will throw away an easy win because they think they need to force something.
5. I'm afraid White has more to learn from this game than Black, so I'd move to the next game.

Enjoy, and see you around!];W[in];B[bi];W[km];B[jm];W[jl];B[jn]
