;B[cb];W[ec];B[cf];W[fd];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]C[KKMD: Not joseki. I suppose the main reason is that you force white to play a good move, an extension. In this case it is not so valuable because of the position in the upper left quadrant, but still, even if ultimately you will want to play this move, it just seems too early for that right now.]
;W[ck];B[jq]LB[hq:a][iq:b]C[KKMD: Probably a little too far. You are open to an invasion at A. B would be better.]

;W[qr];B[oq];W[rn];B[np]LB[ip:a]C[KKMD: Thick move, but your position on the lower side is too low to go for this strategy. White should erase it with moves such as A, and reduce the utility of your wall to zip.]
;W[qf];B[qh]LB[nc:a]C[KKMD: The right side is unimportant. Why not answer calmly at A, then?]
;W[rd];B[qe]LB[qc:a]C[KKMD: The last white move was a mistake, but you fail to punish it. A seems like an obvious urgent point to take, to deprive white of eye shape.]

;W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[pi]C[KKMD: Do you really have time to play like this?  You should probably have taken this opportunity to enlarge your moyo. For now you have a giant wall on the right, but it's hard to see what it wil be used for. You got nothing on the upper part on the board, the center is still empty, and you are low on the lower side. If you want to give some meaning to the wall you just built, you should play in the center, to get territory there. Since it's not really what walls are for, it means that building this wall was perhaps not a good idea in the first place.]
;W[lc];B[jc]LB[jd:a]C[KKMD: What is your plan with this move? Your only chance to save the game would be to make territory in the center, so you could be satisfied if white connected underneath and you build yet another outside wall.To do so, a move like A would be standard.]
;W[jb];B[ib];W[kc];B[jd];W[hb];B[id];W[hc];B[hd];W[le]TR[hd]
[id][jd][jc]C[KKMD: This is a catastrophic result. You let white go inside your moyo, and you created a weak group, that white can use to further invade your moyo. That's the last thing you want to happen when playing a moyo-oriented strategy.]
;B[ci];W[nd];B[pa]C[KKMD: I think you should have been punished for that move, at least more strongly than what really happened.]
;W[od];B[rb];W[rc]LB[qb:a][qc:b][sb:c]C[KKMD: I don't like this answer, since it gives black the possibility of creating an eye in the corner with the sequence A-B-C. White at B seems better.]
;B[mc];W[nc]LB[md:a]C[KKMD: Here, if white plays A, I can't see how you get out of this situation (then again, it's possible I missed something).]
;B[md];W[me];B[mb];W[nb];B[ld];W[kd];B[kb];W[lb];B[ja];W[gd]
;B[ig]LB[ii:a]C[KKMD: OK, you tricked white... sort of. He feels the need to defend his group, so doesn't attack from A, which would be the right direction if possible.]
;W[gf];B[jj]TR[ig]C[KKMD: The relation to the marked stone is loose, but the idea behind the move is correct.]
;W[kg];B[hf];W[gg];B[jo]LB[ih:a]C[KKMD: So what if white cuts at A? I give one sequence as an example of what might happen.]

(;W[jl];B[km]C[KKMD: Defending passively points like that is doable when you're ahead, and white is not attacking something else with his stone. Here, arguably, the game is close enough to just defend your points like that (but even that seems a little doubtful to me); a bigger problem is that you still have an unsettled group, and white stone is aimed at attacking it.]

;W[pl];B[ol]LB[oj:a]C[KKMD: This move leaves a cut at A. I don't understand why white didn't cut, now or afterwards. Right now, it's possible that black could get revenge on the white central group, so even if white seems to gain in the exchange, I can understand white would find it dangerous. But a bit later in the game, this cut was risk-free...]

C[KKMD:];W[ce];B[be];W[cg];B[bg]LB[hl:a][dk:b]C[KKMD: It was certainly more urgent to escape with your weak group.So don't hesitate, go for A, or maybe B, and forget about your side stone. Then again, white does an excellent job in this last phase of the game.]
;W[df];B[bf];W[ch];B[bh];W[di];B[dj];W[cj];B[bi];W[ei];B[cm]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dk];W[bk]TR[dj][dk][cl][cm]LB[oj:a]C[KKMD: In normal conditions, I would say this: "These stones served you well, white answered submittively to them. Now you should treat them lightly. Threaten to use them to reinforce your dragon, but don't get too attached to them." In this situation, however, you don't have enough territory. Even if you save these stones you'll probably lose; and I'm not counting the cut at A. The game is over.]
