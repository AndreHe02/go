AB[dp][pd]PL[W];W[dd];B[cn]C[It is unusual to not play in the open corner here, but not necessarily bad.]
;W[pp];B[qf];W[nc];B[pc]C[This is a reasonable way to defend the corner.]
;W[fq];B[dq];W[dr]
(;B[eq]TR[cr][er]SQ[dp][dq]C[This makes an empty triangle, which is almost always a bad shape. Try to avoid making empty triangles.
Here, E2 and C2 are both better choices.  E2 is more aggressive and C2 is more defensive.

See Variation];W[er];B[cr];W[fo];B[qh]SQ[fc][cf][ic][ci][lp]
[qn][qk]C[This is too small of a move for the opening.  All 4 sides are largely unclaimed.  You should either play an approach move on one of white's corners, or play in the middle of an open side. The squares are all good choices.  The marked spots are all on the third line except M4 on the bottom.  It is on the 4th line because white has a small wall in the lower left corner facing this side]
;W[qm];B[ck]C[Again, too small for the opening.];W[cg];B[cj]
TR[fc][lc]SQ[ic]C[This is too close to your C9 stone for the opening.  In the opening you play loosely connected stones all over the board.  Once the mid game starts you begin connecting everything tightly.
Here you should play at J17.  White will probably play on one side of your J17 stone.  Then, you extend to one of the triangles, the one away from where white just played.]
;W[fr];B[kc]C[This attacks white's O17 stone, which is OK to do at this point.]
;W[kd]
(;B[jc]SQ[jd]C[K16 is better.  You want access to the center in case you need to run out.

See Variation];W[lc];B[lb]SQ[gc]C[You want to make a wide base for your stones so you have room to make eyes if needed.  G17 does this well.  G16 would also work since it gives more access to the center.]
;W[mb];B[kb]TR[jc][kc]SQ[ka]C[L19 is better.  It doesn't make an empty triangle.  It also starts to make an eye shape around L18]
;W[ld];B[ic]SQ[gc]C[Again, you should jump out farther along the side.  G17 is still good.]
;W[ie];B[qq]TR[pq][iq][mo]SQ[mq]C[A 3x3 invasion here should succeed but isn't the best idea.  You should be able to make your stones live in the corner.  This will give you some corner territory and give white a wall facing along the lower side.  Since white already has a wall around F3, you are essentially giving white the entire lower side in exchange for a few points in the corner.
You would be better off trying to invade the lower side.  I would invade at N3 and then play one of the triangles depending on how white responded.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[qn]TR[qm]SQ[rn]C[Because of the stone at R7, white can play S6 instead.]
(;B[qk]SQ[pr]C[You should finish making your lower right corner invasion secure before moving on. 

See Variation];W[qj];B[pj];W[pk];B[qi];W[ok]TR[fo]SQ[im]C[White is beginning to surround a large area of territory on the lower side.  You don't want white to succeed.
The square is a good place to play to start reducing White.  Imagine a line from white's F5 stone to white's P9 stone.  Anything below and to the right of that line is an invasion and anything above and to the left of that line is a reducing move.  The square is just outside of this line so it is a reducing move.  Reducing moves are safer but accomplish less.]
;B[oj];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[rh];W[ql];B[sj];W[hc]
(;B[hb]SQ[gc]C[Now that stone at G17 I recommended back on move 24 would be very handy since white would be in Atari.

See variation];W[gc];B[ib];W[gb];B[ja]C[Good, that makes your group live.]
;W[la];B[ha];W[qr]C[Now black's stones in the lower right corner are in serious trouble]
;B[rr];W[rn]
(;B[qs]SQ[pr]C[Q2 would be better

See Variation];W[pr];B[rs];W[rp]C[Black is dead.];B[sp];W[so]
(;B[ch]C[If you are going to do a 3x3 point invasion of the upper left corner, now would be a good time.

See Variation.];W[dg];B[dh];W[jp]C[This secures a large area of lower side territory for white.

Currently, white is ahead.  Black needs to make some center territory while reducing white's center territory.]
