;B[pd];W[dc];B[pp];W[eq];B[de];W[ee];B[dd]LB[ef:a][cc:b]C[This is not joseki.  The joseki moves are 'a' and 'b'.  The main reason it is not joseki is that, after W responds at 'c' he has an automatic 'hane at the head of two stones'.  That is a good shape to have to B should avoid it.]

LB[eb:a]C['a' is correct shape];W[ec];B[lc]LB[mc:a][nc:b]C[Too far.  W has a strong shape to the left so B should haold back to 'a'.  This leaves an invasion point at 'b' for W to exploit in the future.]
;W[qf]C[Wrong corner.  W should not push B to strengthen his over extended shape.  The lower right corner is the better place to play.]
;B[pi]LB[pj:a]C['a' is better balance with the lower right]
;W[of];B[nd];W[jc]C[Wrong direction.  W shoujld not try to make territory in front of his strength, especially as it is open at the edge.]

;B[ni]C[Wrong direction. B is forcing W to move out to connect to his strong group to the left.  It is better to do nothing than to do this.]
;W[mh];B[kg]LB[kf:a][jf:b]C[This, in conjunction with the keima at 23-25 is too weak.  B needs to play better shape than this.  Exchange 'a' or 'b' before B33]

C[This just fills in Bs liberties.  Connecting at 'a' preserves the options of playing Bb, Wc, Bd later.]
;W[ke];B[ie];W[id];B[jh];W[ji];B[ii]C[No way this can work.  B is in trouble.]
;W[hh];B[gg];W[gh];B[fg];W[fh]LB[ij:a]C[Overplay.  Just caputing at 'a' leave B with a very weak group.]
