C[Hello, my name is Eric.  This is a game in which I played as white on April 19th on KGS under the account name of Ninjurai, taking a komi of 0.5.

Where I can, I'll be taking a moment to ask a question or two about possible alternate moves, or explaining my thought process for making what moves I did.  I figure to a stronger player, a lot of my plays don't make a lot of sense without a bit of commentary :D

Heh, Thanks! =)

I've also removed the chatter between Gwelf and me, since it was just greetings, thank-yous, and farewells.

Hi, I'm Jon, I'm 9k on KGS, and I'll try my best to do a clear review.

Sometimes I've done long variations, most of it is just to give an example of what I'm saying - no need to memorize them or anything =)...

well, with that lets get to the review =)];B[pd];W[dp];B[dc]
;W[qp];B[pn]C[One of the points of R4 is to get an enclosure with P4 and extend up the right side (see 2nd variation) - but this black move just blocks it. 

It's very tricky to know what to do here... if you make a corner enclosure he might just take the left side (see 3rd Variation).

What I like, personally, is your idea of trying to get some territory up the left side, but I don't think you moved far enough up to get the most out of your move (see 1st variation).]

(;W[qm];B[qk];W[mq]C[Looking back, I'm not wholly sure why I made this move.  Seems to leave R7 a bit stranded.

>Its a very very very good idea - the best choices for black are cutting at R6 or causing you trouble at P4 - both I've run through - and in both black is pretty screwed =P

However, they take a lot of thinking and fighting to get right (I've had to have a few looks myself before finding good results).]

(;B[pm];W[ql]C[I played here because I figured black would close me in at Q8, allowing me to connect to R4 (he did).  How effective would a black cut have actually been here?

(;W[dm]C[Looking at trying to make some center influence, here.

>It's a good idea, but black can destroy a large big of your side here as in the variation. You're slightly ahead here - so I think you might be better off defending with this move, then invading black's territory - securing a lead for yourself (variation)]

C[I seem to end up running alongside my opponent a lot in my games (like I just did here) creating a long pair of walls for both of us.  Should this usually be avoided?  I ask because I don't see it happen much among higher-ranked players,

> I've included two variations to explain why too much running alongside isn't done much in higher ranking games. I hope they answer all

On the side, I think it's a really good idea to watch games by better players... one of the things to look out for... are  the moves they do first (do they attack first? Do they defend first? Do they make corner enclosures first?)]

Thank you for taking the time to review my game!

>No problem, it's been fun =)

If you've got any questions don't feel weird or hesitate in asking them! (just send me an e-mail at LithiumTwo@gmail.com)...

You're quite good at fighting, you just need to watch out for wasted moves... think, if you didn't waste a move earlier in this game you could have won (and you pointed the move out - so no reason why you couldn't have won!)...

Also, as I said before, it might be useful for you to do a few Life and Death problems on www.goproblems.com, or get a book on the subject - there are quite a few around! =)...

good luck with your go!

The idea is... on the sides, and bottom, black gets thickness and white gets territory - which is pretty much how all crawls like this go...

But the rule of thumb, is that:

on the right (white is 2 away from the line) black and white get around equal profit from this.

on the bottom (white 1 away) black gets more profit than white

and on the left (white 3 away) white gets more profit.
