RE[W+T]

C[KKMD: Hi, this a game I played as white. It didn't go very far, because the time control was rather fast (30 min + 20s/m) and my opponent fell on time during the middle game. I think there are however enough moves played to find a lot of mistakes :-). I tried to explain my feelings during the game and afterwards, how I evaluate the position, so that you can criticize my way of thinking.

[kb\]: Hi, I am Kyle Blocher, AGA 5-dan.  I'm happy to review your game.]

;B[cf];W[pj]TR[jc][kc][jd][kd]C[KKMD: I was quite happy to try such a strategy, and looking forward an enjoyable game. I still feel good about it, so if you think this is a bad idea, please tell me!

[kb\]: Go is a game of lots of possibilities. ;)
You may also consider one of the marked points instead to help your stones on the left side.]

;W[mr];B[lq];W[lp];B[kr];W[nn]C[White's wall is working well with the position, so you are doing fine.]
;B[jd]TR[de][dd][ec]C[KKMD: This is a very logical move, I would say. I don't know what to do with this stone. If black had played much closer to the marked stones, I would have been willing to sacrifice them, but in this situation I feel I have to reinforce them and fight from here.

[kb\]: Agreed.  Creating shape looks good here.]
(;W[db]LB[hd:a][cc:b]C[KKMD: Maybe A or the variation starting with B were better?]
;B[cc];W[fd]TR[hc]C[KKMD: This feels a little heavy and slow, but I don't what else to propose.

[kb\]: This isn't bad, since E13 as a follow-up feels like a good move.  You may also consider playing at the marked point, which will stabilize your group and give it a base.]
;B[nc]C[KKMD: As black I would have preferred the high approach, I think.

[kb\]: I disagree.  White's moyo is still invadable.];W[ne]
;B[nk]LB[ld:a][lf:b]C[KKMD: This move surprised me, I don't expect black to tenuki at this point. Actually, if black plays quietly A instead, I'm not sure how to answer (maybe B?). Anyway, in this situation, I figured I could attack calmly, knowing that I will probably be able to hurt black, either by playing a move more in the center, or by invading in the top.

[kb\]: Your analysis is correct.];W[lj]TR[lk]C[This isn't the natural direction to attack from.  You should play directly orthogonally to the stone.]

(;B[ni]C[Black plays very heavily.];W[lh];B[ml]LB[kl:a]
(;W[ln]TR[jo][jp][jq][ip][iq][hq]LB[kl:a]C[KKMD: The heart wanted to continue the attack with A, but the head decided it was too risky.

Continuing at A is necessary.  Your three stones are safe because all of the marked points are sente to capture the lower Black stones.]
;B[kl]TR[lj][lh]C[KKMD: The only thing I got is sente. The two marked stones, while not completely indifferent to the fight that will happen in the top, don't seem very efficient.

[kb\]: You didn't play the key point, like you said.];W[mc]
LB[lc:a]C[KKMD: Was A a better invasion point? Or something else?

[kb\]: A is better.  This stone is easily sacrificed and it's better to put more pressure on the left Black stone at the same time.]
;B[md];W[nd];B[lc];W[mb];B[lb];W[nb];B[oc];W[ob]C[KKMD: Judging by his reaction, my opponent had missed that the two black stones are now captured.]
;B[gc]TR[dd][fd][ec][db][de]LB[ic:a][ol:A]C[KKMD: My spirits abruptly sanked at this point. Black exposes the weakness of my position. I thought about invading at A. What I read during the game was that this could lead to an exchange, white capturing the top black group in exchange for his marked stones. I didn't like this result , and was very uncertain something even worse was not going to happen. So I decided to let black live, pressuring from outside, hoping to gain power in order to reduce the left side and attack the center black group. I thought my main problem was "how to keep sente?".

[kb\]: White is doing OK.  Black still has a weak group in the center, though it has become more urgent to defend the right side (it's a lot of points!)]

(;W[he]C[F18 is also playable, and worth a lot of points.]
(;B[gd]C[KKMD: Certainly a mistake.];W[ge]C[[kb\]: Thx!];B[pl]
C[Very large.];W[ic]C[Also very large ;)];B[id];W[hd]TR[gd]
[gc]LB[pl:a]C[KKMD: So it seems the marked stones are captured. Again, the game looked good for me.]
;B[jg]TR[lj][lh]C[[kb\]: Now the marked stones will become much more useful.]

(;W[ii]C[KKMD: I didn't think more than 10 seconds for this move. It is a good shape, it seems to keep black groups separated...

[kb\]: This is a light shape, not for attacking.  You may try attacking indirectly.]
;B[ji]LB[jj:a]C[KKMD: But I didn't know how to react to this move. I was afraid that the natural answer A would lead to something like the variation.]

(;W[jh];B[lg]TR[pj]LB[mh:a]C[KKMD: The first move that came to mind here is of course A. But I figured it would allow black to easily invade the right side, probably capturing the marked stone in the process, while I wouldn't achieve much. That's what I went on a plan of making eye-shape in the center, letting black connect, make territory on the right, then do something on the left side. I figured doing so I should end up with more territory.

[kb\]: see variation]
(;W[jj];B[mg];W[mh];B[nh];W[og];B[ng];W[ph];B[qc]C[[kb\]: The problem is that this side isn't yours.  Black should live here.]
;W[pc];B[qi];W[pi]
(;B[qd]C[[kb\]: Heavy.];W[re];B[qe];W[rf];B[hg]LB[dj:a]C[KKMD: After the game, black explained he played this move as a threat against the top-left white group. I think the game would be much more difficult for white if black played A instead, for instance.

[kb\]: This is a dame point.  White is alive at the top left.]
;W[dj]LB[cm:a][jq:b][pn:c][kl:A]C[KKMD: Black sadly lost on time. I'm not sure how to assess the position now. White's upper-right seems smaller than I had expected. Black has all the sente moves up there, so I would expect at most 30 points there. So all in all I would evaluate white to have 45+ points of territory. Black's territory is harder to evaluate, but I would say 10 points in the lower right, 12 points in the lower left, 10 points in the upper left, 5 points in the center for a total of about 37+. Threats on the right side should give him probably about 10 more, so the game seems somewhat balanced. Problem: black has the move, and has big points to aim at: A, B, or C. I would probably go for C, right now, and take sente to play A at the end of the sequence. So, all in all, it seems to me white is behind and struggling, here.

[kb\]: My estimate is White is leading, but not by much, since Black is dead at the top right.  Otherwise Black would be leading by a lot.

You played a fairly good game, but missing the key point at A is disappointing and game-changing.  You would have been even farther ahead.]
