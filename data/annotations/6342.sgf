C[Hello my name is Auke-Dirk
this game is played on kgs with half hour time each.

Why i send this game, this is a tipical game for me when i feel i controle it and hunt my opponent a bit .. but as you might have guessed.... i lost it.

So i lost and  i would be very gratefull for some comments..




QuickMan: Let's take look at it!

I apologize for any english mistakes in advance, I believe you will understand my thoughts all the time :)

Note that I don't comment all small mistakes and the endgame.
I also try to concentrate on mistakes in the way of thinking rather then tsumego.

I always mark 3 most serious mistakes you should always try to understand and remember even if you ignore everything else, these mistakes doesn't need to be mistakes that lost u most points, but more likely shows the bad way of thinking.

Have fun.


(I know this is ambitous, and I don't pretend to be able to make this at 100%, so any comment of comment is welcomed )]

;B[rr]TR[fq]C[When i have a stone on the rightside i preffer to play s2 instead of p2..
Is that oke?

QuickMan:I believe that both is playable, as the triangled stone is far enough]
;W[pp];B[oq]LB[qm:C][lq:A][oq:B]C[QuickMan:We both know this is a very good eschange for black, but you must realize few things.

1) Some players make some obvious mistake in the beginning on purpose to make their opponent understimate them (Bad manner technique but often succesful)

2) Becouse you could overestimate the value of this, let's try to (very approximately) calculate how many points is it worth of.

a) the aji at A/B is gone + the territory is more secure (10 poitns)

b) the invasion at C later on will be harder to make for black (-5 points)

So let's assume the mistake is (very very approximately) worth of 5 points.


3) Your opponent has the same rank as you have, so he is probably better at the later stage of the game.

==> Don't underestimate him];W[ql]TR[qk]C[QuickMan:Another mistake of your opponent, after the exchange,  he should have expand at least one point further!!]
;B[cn];W[eo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[dm]C[QuickMan: This move of your opponent is too submisive.]
;B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[co];B[qj]TR[ql][po][pp][qp][qq]C[I felt white was not really alive yet with the s2 stone in place.. so i thought atack while he is still weak... maybe to early??

QuickMan: I think this move is good, but don't think he will be demolished if he tenukis, as he made this overconcentrated shape, it is quite robust]
;W[cj]C[tenuki.. then i must invade i tought.];B[qn]LB[oj:A]
[nn:B]C[QuickMan: This move is questionable, and maybe too straightworward, I believe some strong players would play it, but I wouldn't.

A or B would force him to live, which is humiliationg enough as punishment for tenuki.]
;W[pn];B[qm];W[pm];B[rl];W[pl];B[rn]LB[qh:A]TR[rk]C[i played s6, white cannot cut at s9
and i can always connect with the bottom group t3.

QuickMan:The triangled spot is much better move!

a) better shape
b) much less aji around A

This is the first serious mistake.];W[qh]LB[rk:A];B[pj]LB[oj:B]
[rk:A]C[Here is a i don't know ..

i did not want white to connect, so i felt q10 would split and put pressure on white.

QuickMan:You can immedeatly see that the stone at A would be very helpful, this was the aji I was talking about :)

With stone at A, B would been possible];W[qf]TR[qe]
(;B[nj]C[afterwords i felt this could've been played better for black. Idea's?]
;W[mn];B[lp];W[ok];B[oj];W[rd];B[nc];W[qc];B[kc]TR[qc][rd][qf]
[qh]C[White is happy with this result, he has sente and safe group.]
;W[ic]TR[kn]C[QuickMan:This is white's overplay for sure as the triangled spot is urgent for both.]
;B[kn]C[white still not alive.. but he is building bigtime at the top... atack?

QuickMan:Correct.];W[ll];B[fc]TR[ok][ll][pl][ql][pm][mn][pn]
[po][pp][qp][qq]C[desperate attempt to reduce leftside... i feel here is were i need some advice....

QuickMan:I also don't think that attacking the white group directly won't get you something.

So the question is:
How to reduce white, while slowly closing the way for the white group 
or
To close the way for the white group IN A WAY the forcing move on the white group will get you something.

I don't say I know the anwer, heh, I just wanted you to try to think about this more often in your games :)

This move seems to be ok.];W[ec];B[fd];W[df];B[ce]LB[hd:B][ie:A]
TR[ok][ll][pl][ql][pm][mn][pn][po][pp][qp][qq]SQ[fc][fd]C[QuickMan: Oh, this is very impatient move.

Move around A,B seems to be much better, because.

a)It slowly closes the way for the triangled move.
b) It attacks the lonely white stone
c) It makes the square moves stronger (extend the weak group prowerb.

while your mova aims just for single thing - reduce territory

3 reasons against 1 seems to be very simple but effective argumentation :)

This is the 3rd most serious mistake.];W[de];B[ff]LB[ce:A][de:B]
[ff:C]C[QuickMan: It is inconsistent to first eschange A for B, to make white stronger there, and then extend at C.]
;W[ie];B[ke]LB[hg:A][ig:B]C[You still need very badly play on the right:

Proverb:"Extend the weaker group"

Quite safe A, or very aggresive B would serve your purpouse better.]
;W[ig];B[fh]
(;W[dh];B[ij]LB[ii:A][lj:B]C[QuickMan: Good move, split white, and kill at least one part, I would play more directly A]
;W[hi];B[fj];W[hj];B[fl]C[QuickMan:This is painful, white is gettring too many moves in the center, and your attack is going to be wasted.]

(;B[qe]LB[rd:A][pj:B][pp:C]C[You should have DEFINETLY play this one, becouse if white gets A, it is a loss for you.

It is a loss because white got too safe and nice shape inside the sphere of your influence.

Don't forgot, the B must have been used in both directions, or iit was useless move.

Not playing this move is bigger than the C mistake in the beginning, so I believe that white will be ahead when he gets to A.

This is the second serious mistake.]))
