AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[This game was played with a clock. White got 20 minutes plus 5 byo-omi periods of 30 seconds and Black got 60 minutes plus byo-omi. Black was also the one who recorded the game.

These two players have played each other many times. This is their first game at six stones. Previously they have played at seven stones.


Max-I'll do my best with commentary. It's harder with handicap games.]
;W[nc];B[qf]LB[kd:B][pf:A]C[[Roger Schrag\] In discussion after the game, White said that Black's move at R14 was a "disservice to Black". White thought Black should have played at A or B. B seems to me like too weak of a pincer. What do you think would be the best play here?

Max-A is a more normal response, but I can't fault your move. It puts less pressure on white, but is a stronger connection. B is fine too, as is m16. The last two would lead to more of a fighting game.]
;W[fc];B[cf]LB[jd:A]C[[Roger Schrag\] Should I have played at A in order to prevent White from getting that move? The person who played White in this game probably thinks so, but another 5k player who I play frequently says Black is being too greedy if he plays at A.

Max- Given that you have so many stones, A is severe. But if it's a fair handicap, you've possibly also developed complications you don't want. Also it wouldn't be in line with the flavor of your first move. If you wanted to attack at this stage, you should prepare with a move like R14.]
;W[jd];B[dc]LB[hb:B][hc:A]C[Max- A very solid move. Takes the corner and threatens an invasion (A or B). Though I might have played k3 or k4 to make things harder for white down there.]

(;B[cl]LB[cq:A]C[Max- Given that corners are easy money, I would prefer to play A (see variation).]
;W[cq];B[bo];W[qg];B[pc]LB[pf:A][rg:B]TR[qf]C[Max- The marked stone was under attack. I think you should have extended to a or played hane underneath at B.]

;W[hd]
(;B[gd]LB[gc:A]C[Max- I think this move was greedy and worked well for white. Beter to play A (see variations)]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[ic];B[ka]C[Max- Too early for an endgame move like this.]
;W[mb];B[ma];W[mh]C[Max- White moves to capture on a large scale.]
;B[le];W[kc];B[kf];W[rk];B[pa];W[ra];B[sb];W[sf]C[[Roger Schrag\] My opponent said after the game that at this point he thought Black could still kill White. I still can't see a way to do this. Can you see a way for Black to kill White?

Max- If you make an eye (see variation) you can get seki. I don't think you can do better than that.]

(;B[sd];W[sc];B[se];W[sj];B[sl];W[sk];B[rm]C[Max- A gote sequence and rather small still.]

(;W[si]C[Max- I don't think white needed this move. As you can't make an eye, you can't win the capture race.]
;B[ng];W[nh]C[Max- This exchange strengthened white. How did it help you?]
;B[ia];W[hb];B[jg];W[hg]C[Max- You can cut this stone off.  Often the best defense is a good offense.]

(;B[lg]C[Max- Too timid and slow.];W[mf]C[Max- This was a greedy move by white.]

;W[bh];B[af]C[[Roger Schrag\] Okay, Black is being foolish here. I don't know what I was thinking.

;B[id];W[ff];B[ee];W[fh];B[gh];W[hh];B[gi]C[[Roger Schrag\] Black is trying very hard here to prevent White from getting a second eye. But White will probably be able to either get a second eye or connect out. Is Black being overly-agreesive? Should Black have let White get his second eye but try to profit from it with a territory gain?

Max- Gain territory where? Almost all black's territory has been lost. Only chance is with a kill. You do in fact gain a lot in your attack, but it's not enough.]

(;B[ih]LB[mk:A]C[[Roger Schrag\] Should Black have played at A to start a ko fight? Afterwards White said Black should have done this, but I wasn't sure if Black might have gotten hurt in the ko fight.

Max- I suppose you should have tried. I can't see black winning the ko or getting sufficient compensation, but one should always look for the opportunity.]
