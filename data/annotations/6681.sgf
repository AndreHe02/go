AB[pd][dp]C[A game agains a 7 kyu.
2 Stones Handicap


I think, my biggest problem is, that I don't know when to attack, when to secure the own territory, and expanding to which side and how far.



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hi, my name is Wrenn and I am a player on KGS. I will try to address the questions you asked. If I notice something else, I will try to point it out as well :)]
;W[pq];B[cd]C[I thought, it was better to take another corner but to save on of the two existing


W: That is true, there is no reason not to take the empty corner :)]
;W[ed];B[df]LB[cc:B][ce:A]C[W: What he played [A\] was a definite overplay. [B\] is the usual joseki move.]

(;W[ce]C[W: This move may look aggressive, but it is simplay a mistake. The first move I consider, given the shape, is D15, cutting off his stone. Afterwards, you can connect at D16 or by capturing the C15 stone in a ladder]

(;B[cf]C[This is not a terrible move, but it gives White some better continuations.]

(;W[be];B[de]
(;W[bd];B[dd];W[bf]LB[bg:A][ch:B]C[Good, solid play for Black

[A\] does not kill White, and the cutting point might be very painful later. 
[B\] does not kill White either, bit there is less future weakness, and White will not get anything out of crawling along the second line so early in the game.]

(;B[bg];W[cc];B[dc]TR[ed]C[Went on, building a Wall agains the marked stone.

W:  Good :)];W[cb];B[db];W[ag];B[bh];W[ac]LB[jd:A]C[W: now is the time to play a big point. K16 immediately jumps to mind, as an ideal extension from Q16, and an efficient way to extend from your wall.

Generally a five space extension is considered ideal. You may wonder why such a large extension is good, so I will attempt to explain. You can see the explanation at [A\]]

(;B[ah]C[W: Very, very small, and a waste of a move.];W[da]
;B[ea];W[ca];B[eb];W[gd]C[W: This is bad fo White, because it is two weak stones next to a small wall, and Black's next move is quite good., although a farther pincer attack would give lem less of a chance to settle their shape. I still recommend K16, because it is the ideal 5 space extension.]
;B[id]C[Making territory and also attacking his stones, thought it couldn't be that bad.

W: That is true, but it would have been even better before he played G16.]
;W[ee];B[hf]C[W: attacking from a distance is good. It is always useful to remember though that the knight's jump can be cut.]
;W[he];B[ie];W[gf]
(;B[hg]C[And again, building a wall and attacking

W: Still good :)];W[gg]C[W: this is the start of a pushing fight, a very common scenario in go. The player who is ahead has a huge advantage, because he can hane at any time. When you are ahead, you can extend a single place or hane, and when you are behind, you should try to jump away as soon as possible. Here you should still hane or double hane, running them into your wall. also this builds a thick wall facing the right edge.

Notice, it is when you get into this close fighting that White tends to get the advantage. It is very hard to kill something, and if you do not do it right or cannot, you tend to make yourself very thin in the area.]

(;B[nd]C[Too afraid so I thought "maybe you should make the corner yours"

W: You should not let them get ahead in the pushing race, as now you cannot attack them, and your strong wall will be cut off from everything, and be forced to live after White escapes.]

(;W[oc]LB[nc:A][od:B]
(;B[nc]C[I absolutely don't know, what to play against P17.
The following moves doesn't look bad for my I think.

W: an easy way to respond is by filling in your only weakness, the P16 push, that way White is trapped with tny territory along the upper edge. See the earlier variation.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[pc];B[qd];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd]
;W[ra]C[W: White is now alive in the corner for sure. The combination of moves like S19 and T18, making an eye there, is a very common, useful technique for living easily.]

(;B[nb]C[W: Probably a too small move, considering, the white stones won't die.]
;W[pe]C[W: When White cuts here, you are in a tight spot.];B[rf]
;W[of];B[ne];W[qf];B[rg]LB[re:A][qh:B]C[now White has a weak group to attack, and it is no longer possible to get a very good area along the right, wasting the efficiency of the wall on H and J lines. Black has a shape weakness at S15 that White can take advantage of. B is also a very good place to continue and attack.]

(;W[ri]C[W: this is bad of White, allowing Black to counter attack against the three weak stones/]
;B[pg]C[good attack :)];W[pf];B[qg];W[nf]C[now you have to be careful, you have two groups under attack. If you push him directly, you throw him into your second weak group. The trick is to attack from a distance.]

(;B[mf]C[This forces White to attack you]
(;W[nh];B[qe]C[if you do not follow up, White makes good shape.]
;W[mg];B[lf]
(;W[pi];B[oh];W[ng]C[W: good job noticing the snapback here. It is seeing these simple capture techniques that make forcing your opponent around in a fight much easier.]
;B[oi];W[lg]C[now White is in serious trouble, and is pushing from behind, again, being ahead in a fight like this is quite good :)]
;B[kf];W[nj]LB[se:A][oj:B]C[W: [A\] is making two eyes in gote, While [B\] continues an attack on two weak groups.]

(;B[se]C[slow, now WHite can play P10, forcing you inside a huge wall.]

(;W[sg];B[rh];W[sh];B[qi]C[I live <3

You had a good chance of living before, and making an eye just wastes a move. Look at the variation beginning on move 71.]
;W[qj];B[qh];W[rj];B[pj]
(;W[pk];B[oj];W[ok]
(;B[dj]LB[gh:A]TR[pq]C[Too far maybe?
For which Side should I have aimed?
Or should I have attacked the marked Stone?
If attacking, from which Side?



(No need to give a big introducing in Fu/Joseki, just a little hint, from which Side and how and why, would be enough for me at this time)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
W:
This is a good point to stop and look at how the game progressed. First, there is still that very very imporant pushing fight against the G13 group. It seems like that is the biggest, most urgent area right now. allowing it to escape weakens Black's position. ([A\] see variations for move 34)

Approaching the marked stone is now very difficult, due to the White wall on rows 9 and 10. he will force you into a cramped shape and attack you, maybe even killing you.

The move you played is too close to your thickness to be very efficient, and [A\] more effecticely builds you influence.

Also notice though that building influence and a big wall does not do you nearly as much good now as it did earlier in the game.]
;W[cn]LB[cl:A][co:B]C[Again, use thickness to attack towards. pincering from a huge group just wastes its attacking ability. Running a small group into a big group squashes the small group.

[A\] is a tiny extension.
[B\] forces the stones into Black's thicker side.]
(;B[cl];W[cp];B[do];W[bm];B[bl];W[cq]LB[dn:B][bo:A]C[[A\] is a nice placement tesuji, but it does build White's thickness, making E4 and E5 weak. You should wait, and if White wastes a move to prevent [A\], you will have gained a move.]

(;B[bo];W[co];B[bn];W[cm];B[am];W[bp];B[an];W[dq];B[fp]
(;W[dn];B[hp]C[Black is in trouble.]
(;W[eo];B[ep];W[fo]TR[go]C[White is helping you by playing so close, thank him by making good shape when you can :)

The triangled point makes a tiger's mouth, pushing him around and getting easy eyeshape.]

(;B[jp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq]C[W: remember when I said being behind in a push race is bad?

hane and attack him very harshly.]
(;B[nq]LB[kp:A]C[Not really gaining territory, but agains building out, outer influence.


W: This takes the pressure off of the weak J3 and K3 stones.]

(;W[oo]
(;B[lp]C[hane to attack, he is so weak there, he will not be able to cut and get a good result.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[gr];B[ni];W[mi]TR[go]C[The marked place was problably a very bad Idea.
I Think better would have been(see variation)


W: Once you have beun to cut him , it is essential that you follow-up, otherwise, why not just skip playing O11 for now and play directly at G5, looking to cut later? Also consider the O9 cut.]

(;B[go];W[mk]C[W: Now he is even stronger in the area than before.]
;B[en];W[gi]TR[ea][db][eb][dc][dd][de][cf][df][bg][ah][bh][fn]
TW[aa][ba][ab][bb][bc][ad][ae]C[taking those two ist probably less worth than 122



You should have dealt with ths group a long long time ago. Now there is nothing you can do, and the entire sequence you played in the beginning, getting that huge marked wall, is very much spoiled.]
;B[eh];W[hh];B[ig]C[bad shape, see how dynamically things change if you lose initiative in a pushing fight?]
;W[ih];B[jg];W[jh]C[Maybe the last to moves I was too afraid? He get's a good wall :

Yes, you missed your chances to make him suffer, and he has turned the tables.]
;B[jm];W[jk]C[He gets points, so do I

Let is look at the territory breakdown now, I will have it on the next thread down :)]

(;B[lm]C[Capturing at F6 is huge, because White running away there will be a huge, painful reduction]

(;W[mm];B[mn];W[nm];B[nn];W[on]TR[hc]C[Not good I think. I made him close his territory just by defending a bit. I don't gain much, but lose the opportunity to attack there.

Maybe moves like H17 would be better?

H17 is certainly a big endgame move, but taking at F6 is still quite big, more than the 4 points it seems. Your attack at F2 is also quite good.]

(;B[fr]C[this is very very good :)];W[gq];B[fq];W[fn];B[gp]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[mr];B[nr];W[lr]C[W: White here looks to be in great danger!]

(;B[hr]C[W: This is a real-game life and death problem.  Reading this out is very important, because if you mess it up, you have wasted many opportunities.]

It can be cut, but if you are in a superior position and your oppoonent is weak, that is not a major issue. it is a good way here of boxing them in while threatening to kill them. It also pushes them very aggressively towards your huge, thick wall, which is always a good strategy when fighting.]

Notice how in the joseki, White makes a three space extension from E16.

Because of White's strong corner position, and His good shape, the invasion is unreasonable. 

Black would need a support move at either [A\] or [B\] before being able to invade, and that gives White a chance then to defend against G17.]
