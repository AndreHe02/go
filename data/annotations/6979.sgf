C[Hi, and welcome to my game. My name is Gaseimasha, and I recently played a really tough game with one of my rivals, bluewriter. We are both 8kyu, and in this game things got really intense. Though, in the end, I ended up losing by 16.5 points!

Thank you for reviewing this game, Mr. Reviewer-kun. I will try to ask as many questions as I can, and explain my reasoning as thoroughly as possible. However, this game got really complicated, so I'm liable to get tired after a while. Nevertheless, I shall persevere to the end! lol. XD Let the game begin.

R: Hi, my name's Can. I'll be your reviewer for this match. I'll try to be as thorough as possible.]
;B[qd]C[oh yeah. I am white. :)];W[dq]C[I've always thought that the board position in the variation shown is beneficial and a good fuseki. But in reality, I have not idea why. In the variation, could you tell me what you think of the fuseki, who get's the advantage, development possibilities, ect? Thank you.

R: in the opening, it doesn't really matter much. In the end, it really depends on your style. 

Playing 2 low stones aiming to enclose the corners as soon as possible often means your play will be territory oriented. Advantages of this style is that you will have solid bases to extend from and it will be easier to estimate your land. 

I think this style is easier on your rank because playing higher for influence such as star pts can be hard to estimate and exact equivalent rewards.]

(;B[qp]C[Grr. That bluewriter, always messing with my plans. I didn't expect R4, as he usually plays the opening specified. I think he played here though, because of D3. It seems that it allows black to expand along the bottom side, while discouraging white to do the same. Is that correct?

R: I think his position favours right side not the bottom side. 

Having 2 low stones on the right side means any white's move around that area isn't that rewarding. But after he's enclosed the 2 corners - the right side can be a very big moyo, so at this stage you should think about where to make moves that have equivalent in value. 

You shouldn't consider jumping into that area to prevent the moyo at this stage where there are bigger pts to play.]
;W[dd]C[I decided I didn't want to play the 3-4, as I was white, and I needed to develop quickly. Also, could C16 have put me at a disadvantage, fuseki-wise? I have a hunch it would.

R: you shouldn't feel the need to develop quickly because you play white - komi is there to make sure it's fair. 

However if you want to develop quickly you can look up some 3-3 joseki as it is probably the fastest. 

C16 doesn't really put you at a disadvantage. Follow up after C16: 
- C16 -> E17 -> D5   four stones working in harmony 
- C16 -> D15 -> C9/C10];B[co]C[Ah yes. that bluewriter. What does he think sometimes? I had expected Him to extend along the south to soak up territory. But now I think that he wanted to force me into a bad position. After all, he probably wanted me to extend along the south where my lowness puts me at a disadvantage. Then he could extend along the west! grr!! I won't stand for it!]
;W[cm]C[Chaaaarge!!! *bugle horn*];B[dn];W[dk]C[maybe a little too timid?

R: there's nothing wrong with it if you dont' want to complicate the matter this early.]
;B[cq]C[good move by black, in my opinion.]
(;W[oc]C[I knew that D3 was in a bad spot. But it was only one stone, and I could rescue it later after doing some fighting over in the right. Plus, I didn't want that sly bluewriter to control the pace.

R: you should finish settling the corner first because 
1) black's invading your influence, u should let him grab the corner. 

2) a wasted move is more or less a taboo. Go is about the contest of making the most of each stone. 

3) you can look up joseki to get sente if you dont' want black to set the pace.]
;B[pf];W[ld];B[pc]C[I think he moved too soon on this one. But I have to admit, it gave him some more territory. luckily for me, he didn't hold on to it. hehe. >:D

R: you should respond to this contact play because - again, your stone at P17 can be a wasted move.]
;W[jj]C[here. I was going for big moyo. I know I'm thin on the upper side and on the west side, but he's even more thin on the south and the east. So if he invades, I reason I can do some damage there.

R: at this stage white's at a big disadvantage in my opinion. Black's basically rob white's lower left corner. 

his stones are working together really well. 

You should have settled the lower left corner and respond to the upper right. 

P16 or C2 are still better alternative. 

your moyo isn't as big as you think.];B[fc]C[yup. he invades. At this point however, I realized that it probably wouldn't be a good idea to move to the south or east. I thought maybe I should attack the black stone and profit in the process. heh. always a good idea. But bluewriter is a good rival, and he knows the plan I took. it happens a lot in our games, so he was prepared. >_<]
;W[hc];B[mc]C[reehh??

R: kinda strange to tenuki after making the move. You probably should have make his F17 a wasted move.

If he decides to run that stone, you can benefit simply by chasing it loosely and make full use of your stones.]
;W[md]
(;B[nc];W[nd];B[ob];W[od]C[weird forced exchange. maybe I should have attacked the black stone instead of... well, I can't complain. I have a rather nice wall now. But that stone at Q14 means he can easily limit my influence with it... >_>

R: true, your wall isn't that useful];B[jc]C[ah. ok. Now I see the error of my ways. he was fortifying the top so that I couldn't easily counter attack his k17 stone. good job, bluewriter. ;0

R: you can break his right side by the alternative sequence - though not right now but if you have a chance later on.]

(;W[he]
(;B[fe]C[R: he can just jump into your corner now and black's as good as won.]
;W[lc]C[profit profit. yum yum.];B[hd]C[reeeh??];W[id];B[gd]
;W[ic];B[ie]C[If I played K15, then his J14 would have made it almost impossible to kill his group. he would have succedded in carving out a large piece of my territory. On the other hand, If I play J14, then J16 is in danger... tough odds. In the end, I decided protecting J16 was more important than further attack. was I wrong? black has some mighty good shape here...

R: the problem is that you have that "wall" M16 group as a liability coming into this fight.]

(;W[jd]C[R: this isn't a good move, see variation for detail. 

this move lacks the punch, too slow and the you actually lose a lot of points with this one.]
;B[hf]C[now even better shape. also, my wall doesn't look too good when it's being crushed from the sides... >_<

R: you blew your chance at making your wall useful :P 

now black's attack around C14 area will mean you have already lost.]
;W[df];B[oq]C[oh, NOW he decides to defend the bottom right corner.

R: alternatively, black can D12 to attack your D9 group. 

C17 to solidify his lead. 

P3 means he's already won and doesn't need to do anything extra.]
;W[qj]C[Well, I figure I might as well invade. too can play this game. >:D

R: It's really hard to find a move for white at this stage. 

black can R12 for an easy win. then after white's response black can K4.]
;B[ql];W[qg];B[jq]C[Hmm... I got a small amount of territory, and he got a good formation. I don't like the way this is turning out.

R: you should have resigned several moves earlier but black's K3's too reserved :) I'd play at K4.]
;W[pd];B[qc];W[qf]C[I wanted to get my walls strength back and surround the white area between K10 and Q15. let's see how it went.]
;B[ph]
(;W[pg];B[qh];W[rh];B[ri]C[he's attacking my R10 stone. heh. not bad, bluewriter, you 'ol dog, you.

R: up to this stage you should have S13]
(;W[oj]C[but now I attack you're whole black group. >:D];B[oh]
C[hmm... this is getting complicated. why can't he just back down for once!?]
;W[mi];B[pj]C[here, he surprsied me with a devilishly good tesujii that I didn't see, watch: he manages to capture S12 AND connect his stones.]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[pi];B[rj];W[qi]C[R: you should have read this out - S12 stone means you have no chance at killing this group so why bother?]
;B[oi];W[pj];B[rg]C[damn. Not only do I have a very clunky shape that comes back to haunt me, but black has completely invaded the space I wanted to surround!!! but I'm not dead yeat, I tell ya. the game has only just begun. :D]
;W[rf];B[sh]
(;W[dp];B[cp]
(;W[do]C[R: bad move - you give black a free and really really good move. Not only he solidify his territory but he's not sealed in either.]
;B[cn];W[en]C[R: another bad move.];B[dm]C[R: black's response is just as bad - slow, pointless.

he can probe at F4 and build territory at the bottom or C17, C12 etc.]
;W[cl];B[fo]C[hehe. watch this.];W[go];B[fp];W[fn];B[gp];W[eo]
C[haha!]
(;B[ho];W[gn]
(;B[io]C[R: too slow - he should have played here in the first place]
;W[qq]C[This, while an exceedingly dangerous way to play, proved to be my saving grace. It often happens in games between bluewriter and I that stuff like this turns really crazy. Also, this is the point where my fortunes began to turn, and I was able to give him a good run for his money. My fortunes couldn't sail me all the way to the clear land of victory though. Oh well. better luck next time.]

;W[hq];B[dr]C[awww... T_T];W[js];B[ms]C[This is getting dangerous. I'm this close to being forced to resign. brrr! Thinking about it gives me the chills!]

;B[om];W[in]C[haha! false eye!];B[im];W[hn];B[hl]C[unfortunately, bluewriter is just as stubborn as I am. if it weren't for O7, this would have been a fight I never could have won. as you can probably see, he is running, AND threatening to capture a large group at the same time, furthermore, if he is successful, he will capture an even LARGER group. yikes.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[hj];B[jk];W[kk];B[ij];W[ii]C[not good. not good!]
;B[ik];W[pn]C[T_T];B[jl];W[pm];B[gl];W[hi]C[sadly, H11 was a really bad move that I didn't want to have to make. but if I hadn't done so, I would've had too many cutting points. I would have been slaughtered. unfortunately, this is the move that allows him to capture F6.]
;B[fk];W[gj];B[ej]C[greedy bastard. not satisfied with just one group. he's got to invade, too!]
;W[el]C[haha! sucker!];B[em];W[fl];B[fm]C[so much for the invasion. :D]
;W[dj]C[hmm... perhaps this is a bit too slow?];B[db];W[cc]
;B[fi]C[he's trying to connect. I'll be damned if I let him.(though he does, actually end up connecting. just not to the upper group. watch:]

;W[ig];B[jh];W[if]C[I didn't see it yet. thank god he didn't see it either. Although, maybe he did. If I could capture J15, I might have been able to capture the entire corner. nice!]
;B[ge]C[Awww... T_T];W[ji]C[aji away.];B[kh]C[no he's threatening to connect to the SIDE group! AUGH! It's funny, because this game was all about mutual collaterall damage. he invades me and lives, I invade him and live, and we go back and forth until there's quite little territory left. If only I had been able to connect F6 to a friendly group, the game would have been so close that the victor would've won by very little total territory. shrug.]
;W[mg]C[Halt!];B[kj]C[ack! a double threat!];W[mm];B[ll];W[lk]
;B[lj];W[ml];B[lh]C[his bamboo joint, while technically a good move, shapewise, is what allowed me get my white group to escape.]
;W[fj];B[di];W[ek]C[of course, he takes the opportunity, unfortunately, to invade som more. T_T]
;B[ei];W[ci];B[dh];W[dg];B[ch];W[bi];B[je];W[jf]C[dangerous, but still, he has no eye space. suddenly the game is entirely in my favor. I've got him on the run! hehehe... >D]
;B[ke]C[ouch! Another double threat! apparently, If I reinforce the attack with L14, my J17 group will be in complete danger! argh!!

by the way, do you happen to know who is leading in the balance of territory right now? or who is leading in the balance of power?  by this point, I'm so confused as to who has more territory or power. the situation is complex indeed. mmm.]
;W[kf]C[I decided the kill of a large group would outwiegh the death of a small one. :D was I correct?]
;B[kd];W[le]C[I didn't want him coming any closer to that group in the center. In hindsight, I think I was too careful.]
;B[kc];W[lb]C[this, I thought, was a good move. In any case, it was clear that Black was dead(or so I thought), and this enable me to ultimately claim the entire upper right corner. oh joy!]
;B[jb];W[bm];B[bn];W[rn]C[yose. :D];B[rm];W[qm];B[ro];W[sn]
;B[pl];W[ol];B[nj]C[here it is. The ultimate aji that led to him connecting his group. I certainly couldn't see it. I'm sure it would take a strong player indeed to see it. Far beyond what a mere 8kyu could do. *sigh*...]
;W[ok];B[nk];W[nm];B[nl];W[om];B[mj]C[if would have been pointless to try to cut at O11, because black would have captured the group with N12. damn. there goes my excellent prospects.]
;W[mh];B[ni]C[heh. And the bamboo joint turns out to be an extremely sage decision after all. >_>]
;W[cg]C[in retrospect, B13 would have been so much better that I can't believe how stupid I was for not seeing it. I have no idea who is ahead right now, but I do now that I need all the territory I can get.]

Now then. I must say, that I don't really know where I went wrong with this game, or where I made mistakes. in my head, every single one of my moves has a good reason for me, so it's important that You correct as many of my mistakes as you can. I would also like some general advice of where my game is right now, and what habits I'm doing in my games. Am I not cutting enough? Am I not staying connected? Do I need more reading practice? (although I think I  could always use more reading practice. lol.) I know that a stupid mistake cost me the game, but aside from that, I think this game was really intense. Also, I have made it so that Bluewriter can get this review from you, and have asked for a review of black as well. I don't know he e-mail address though, so send it to mine and I'll make sure he get's it.

Thank you for your time, Mr. Reviewer-san. Thank you so much. (^u^)

R: to be perfectly frank, your play's all over the place and you lack direction. 

Opening - you should settle the corner when opponent's come to challenge you. Avoid wasting stones. 

To settle the corners you should study more joseki - register at gobase.org and look at some common joseki :P  

at the very least, you'll know the outcome is more or less fair. And perhaps you can choose joseki that allow you to have sente after the sequence. 


Midgame, you should spend more time reading and watch high dan's games to at least have a sense of direction. Both black and white make too many unneeded moves. Waste a move = waste a chance. 

Go is a game where both players in the end make the same number of moves - so at the most basic level, who ever makes the most of each stone win. Though, it's hard to know the value of each stone but you should make the effort and think about that every move. 

Endgame moves are fairly weak on both sides. Again, watching games on KGS or IGS would help this greatly. 

Most of all, if you enjoy playing, and the thinking process, I'm sure you will improve consistantly. 

Black's opening is fairly good btw :P 

Goodluck and have fun!])
