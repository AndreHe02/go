C[Dear Francis,
I am Oliver and play as Karthago on IGS, currently as 12k.
My comments will be marked with: K:.
The Go program that you played was very weak. If you want a stronger one, then try Gnu Go (downloadable from the IGS page, or just google it.)
Generally you can practice against them until you become stronger but of course it is more fun against human opponents ;o).]

(;B[eq]C[K: If he plays on the san-san (3-3 point in the corner) it is better to approch this stone from further away or to play on then 4-4 point. I have included some joseki variations.]
;W[cn];B[cr]C[: I would not play this move but ruther retreat to H4]
;W[br];B[dr];W[fn];B[ci]C[: K: This move is good for weakening his influence. The downside is, that he can attack your weak group at the bottom with H3 for example, which would be a real pain.]
;W[cf];B[cl];W[gk];B[ei];W[el]C[K: The moves 14 - 16 are not appropriate at this time I think. You should rather play a corner enclosure (R5 for example) or R10. The latter would be good because the two 3-3 points are low and you can build a moyo on the right side.]
;B[bm];W[dj]
(;B[di]C[K: heavy play. Make sure, your stones are connected!]
;W[cj]C[Should I have played a cut at e9 ?]
(;B[hq]C[K: Taking care of your weak group on the bottom is a good idea, but the timing is wrong. Connect the top stones.]
;W[ff];B[pk];W[hh];B[ic]C[K: Good moyo building];W[jg]C[K: This move is totally senseless]

(;B[qe]C[Play more aggressive?
K: The stones on the left are lost, but you moyo is bigger than his. So protecting it is a good idea. Standard move would be Q14 though, I suppose.]

(;W[im]C[K: Again a very slow move. A human player would invade at one of the following points (variation)]
;B[lp];W[fb]C[K: again no invasion];B[nc]C[Too small ?
K: not the right way to protect. Rather M16 I think.];W[gf]
C[K: Totally wasted move];B[qo];W[mh];B[ph];W[fc]C[K: Again.]
;B[kd]C[K: to small I think. L9 is a good point to play.];W[lm]

(;B[oo]C[K: Too small. Attack his territory while expanding yours. (Variation)]
;W[gn];B[nm];W[bs];B[mk];W[jj];B[nf];W[og];B[bn]C[How Do I make  B7 and D11 alive ?
K: No, they are not connected. They are both dead, if played correctly.]

(;W[jk];B[co];W[dn];B[do];W[oi]C[K: He totally gave the kill away. Lucky you! ;o).

To this move you should react!]

;B[bh]C[Try to kill or determine boundaries ?
K: you cannot kill those. The only way to try is the cut at E10. Then he can connect at B12.]
;W[ej];B[ba];W[cb];B[cm];W[lg];B[me];W[mg];B[tt];W[tt]C[K: Dear Francis,
you were quite lucky that the program did not connect out from the right side and did not kill your stones on the left. 
Try to stay connected and avoid playing small points! I think, that you will figure out quite fast, which points are important.

I hope I could help you out to improve your game. 
If you have any questions about the commentary, please feel free to write me!
