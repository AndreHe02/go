C[Hi,

this is André, I mark my comments with AB. First of all I think this game was not at all bad of you. It is really the two, three mistakes at the end that cost you the game. Studying tsumego is always a good idea and the best way to get stronger. 




Dear reviewer,

I found this a thrilling game to play, but I lost many points due to mistakes. In general, I believe my biggest faults were that I didn't solidify weak groups good enough, and that I didn't see particular flaws in my shapes. For that reason, I think I should practise more tsumego/tesuji problems. Finally, I've notated my thinking process and my logic behind the moves, and I would like to know if there were things I missed, and could have done differently.

Thanks in advance!];B[qd]C[oraxisys [5k\]: Hi gg hf
Badukstone [?\]: Have a good game :)
oraxisys [5k\]: #ASR];W[dc];B[pq];W[dp];B[qk];W[jp]C[AB: I like your move, but all the other ones you mention would be good options as well. No amateur player loses a game because of a different choice here :-).



I though about D15 and P16 as well, but K4 seemed a good move for black, so I played here.]
;B[de]C[Maybe a pincer would've worked well here, with the white corner stone at D4.]
;W[fd]C[AB: Yes, a pincer would a good option. but again, your move is perfectly ok.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[bc]
(;W[eb]LB[dd:A]C[AB: Yes, now we're talking :-). The Black move is not so good, but then it becomes good, because White sticks to some joseki that Black doesn't know. Quite funny actually. D16 would be the shape move here (see variation).



I wasn't sure about this one, perhaps I should have omitted this move?]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[AB: Yes, good choice.

I chose to pincer, to weaken black's position on the upper left, and because my bottom was strong because of K4.]
;B[en];W[fp];B[bp];W[ch]C[AB: Nice! Probably Black should have played in that region (C10, C11) instead of B4.

I didn't play at C3, because I wanted to continue with weakening black's upper left stones.]

(;B[cg]
(;W[dg]C[AB: Good, I don't think the variations are better than what you played in the game.]
;B[bg];W[dh];B[bh];W[bi];B[df];W[cq]C[AB: Perfect! Í think the game is slightly better for White now.


Now the upper black group was settled, I focused on attacking the three black stones.]
;B[hq]C[AB: That seems like an overplay! You have to punish it!]

(;W[gq]LB[go:A]C[AB: I like 'A' better.

I think this is a worse response, than the other two moves I showed.]
;B[hp];W[fn]C[AB: This is the correct idea.

I played this to keep the black stones separated and under attack.]
;B[em];W[ek]LB[gm:A]C[AB: I'm not too sure about this one, maybe you should have kept separating the two groups. The separation is the most important aspect at this point in the game.

To strengthen my group, and to further atttack the 4 stones.]
;B[fl]
(;W[fk]C[Too keep black under pressure.];B[gl];W[hn]C[AB: You can already sense that there are weaknesses in White's position now as well.]
;B[eq]C[Vital point...];W[do];B[dn]LB[cm:A]C[AB: Black should probably do the bamboo. It would be much more severe on White's left hand side.]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[gr];B[jq];W[ho]LB[fo:A]C[AB: Yes, if you had played at 'A' the game would still be quite good for you.


Big mistake, now my group will be isolated and 5 stones will be cut off. Black has a huge potential moyo.]
;B[gp]
(;W[ep];B[fo]
(;W[bq]C[AB: I think you could have captured the Black group (see variation).

To strengthen my group.];B[kq];W[qo]TR[fn][hn][ho][jp]C[AB: The game is good for Black now, obviously. The marked stones look terrible. Entering the way you did is the right choice, I think.

I thought this was the best way to prevent black's moyo.];B[qm]

(;W[oo];B[pp];W[po];B[mp];W[mo];B[lp];W[nq]C[AB: Is that a misclick?]
;B[np];W[ol]C[AB: Yes, important.

Trying to create some sort of eye shape.];B[oj]
(;W[ml];B[km];W[kl];B[jm];W[nj];B[oi];W[od]C[I thought my group was relatively safe for now, so I wanted to flatten black's group with this approach.]
;B[mc];W[qc]C[AB: This joseki is unfortunately quite complicated. 

I didn't really know how to play here, I have weak joseki-knowledge. Ultimately, I played this one, so as to create good shape.]
;B[pc];W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nb];W[nd]LB[qe:A]C[AB: You have to atari at 'A' first.]
;B[ob]LB[qe:A]C[AB: Lucky you, if Black 'A' you are in trouble.]
;W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[rc]
(;W[pg]LB[qi:A]C[AB: I think you can put pressure on Black with 'A'.]
;B[ph]
(;W[qh];B[qi];W[rh];B[og];W[pf]C[AB: A little too easy for Black. Let's evalutate the game. Black has about ten points in the upper right, about eight points on the left, about five points on the right and a combined 32 or so at the bottom for a total of about 45 points. White has about 16 points in the lower left, maybe seven on the left, another five at the top and maybe six on the right plus maybe three or four in the center and another six for komi for a total of 44 ponts. So the game is actually quite close, much closer than I thought just by looking at it.]
;B[of]LB[ff:A][rq:B]C[AB: Unnecessary. So you have an undeserved sente now and the opportunity to turn the game into a favorable one. I like closing at 'A', it gives you a little immediate profit and the prospect to make lots more. A Black move there would be painful.]
;W[nh]C[AB: Good.];B[oh]
(;W[kc]LB[ff:A]C[AB: Yes, not too sure about this one. Starting with 'A' would be better.

Bad move, white's group on the right side isn't alive yet, and is threatened to be sealed in.]
;B[md];W[ne]LB[ri:A]TR[of]C[AB: Yes, I guess. Permitting Black to play there would be horrible. Maybe the marked Black stone wasn't so bad after all.

Slow, but neccesary.];B[ni]
(;W[li]LB[kj:A][lj:B]TR[nh]C[AB: Somehow 'A' and 'B' seem to be better shape. The marked stone is light and can easily be sacrificed.]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[nk];W[lm];B[ln];W[mn]LB[nm:A]C[AB: The peep at 'A' starts to worry me!]
;B[lo];W[jl];B[im];W[mf]LB[ri:A]C[AB: I don't think this is big, making life with 'A' seems better.]
;B[le];W[lb];B[mb];W[lg];B[kf]LB[ic:A]C[AB: Very safe way of White to play. Can Black not invade at 'A'?]
;W[je];B[jf];W[ie];B[if];W[ge]C[AB: This went rather well for White, Black really played badly here. At this point, I think, the game is very favorable for White.]
;B[lf];W[mh];B[nm]C[AB: Looks severe.]
(;W[mm]C[AB: Actually, maybe not (see variation) :-).];B[nl]
;W[pm]C[Also a very big mistake. See variation for my intention behind this move.]

(;B[mk]C[I didn't see this important move, though.];W[lk];B[no]
C[AB: Argh!]

;B[rl];W[rq];B[rn];W[qr];B[pr];W[sr];B[rs];W[qs];B[ro];W[rp]
;B[sp];W[op];B[nr]C[AB: Yes, the game is now hopeless for White.


And here I lost hope. Black's always happy with some extra free points.]

I didn't see this coming, now this group is marked for death too.

>End of my remarks, by the way.<];W[ck];B[bl];W[dl];B[bj];W[aj]
;B[gn]C[AB: I think the game was not bad for you. At some point late in the game it was quite favorable for you. You just let your group be killed :-). Oversights like this happen quite often, unfortunately.
