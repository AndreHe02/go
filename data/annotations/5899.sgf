AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,



Playing black, I lost by 4.5. I think this was because of my endgame, where I feel that my opponent caught up. My opponent and I are also interested in other mistakes we might have made.



Thx,

FlameinIce3838

s: Hello Wendy.  My name is Sam Tregar.  I am rated 4 Kyu on KGS (6 Kyu AGA), so I'm by no means an expert.  If you have questions about my review please feel free to contact me by email or find me on KGS, where my name is "samtregar".  I'll prefix my comments with "s:".]
PL[W];W[dd];B[cf]C[s: good - black must be aggressive when playing a handicapped game.  You start with all your stones high on the fourth line, all influence and no territory.]
;W[fc];B[ci]LB[bd:A]C[s: ok, but I would have pressed the point with A.  C11 focuses on territory but black in handicap games should be attacking, using the power of the handicap stones to win fights.]
;W[cn];B[cp]LB[cl:A][dl:B][co:C]C[s: I don't like this move at all.  You're in the perfect position for a pincer at A or B.  That would serve dual purposes, putting preasure on white and expanding your territory on the side.  If you don't like that and want to cement your corner I think C is still better than this..  White in high handicap games is low on power from the start - you should use your power advantage to push him around, not vice-versa.]
;W[ck];B[qj]C[s: Good.  Janice Kim calls this "rushing to plant your flag."]
;W[np];B[pq]LB[pm:B][kp:A]C[s: Yuck!  White's approach was high and didn't put a lot of preasure on black.   I think a pincer around A or an extension around B would better.  This move is too small and too slow...]
;W[qo]C[s: bad response by white - basically begs you to cut the two stones apart.]
;B[po]LB[oo:A]C[s: this seems ok, but I might prefer A.  Touching a stone makes it stronger.]
;W[qm]C[s: White is playing lightly, keeping options open here.]
;B[qp]LB[pn:B][qq:A]C[s: I really don't like this move.  It makes the empty triangle centered on A.  It does put preasure on white but it leaves him B where he can make the tiger's mouth.  I would play B myself - increase influence and give white lots of problems.]
;W[om]C[His shape doesn't look too good to me.

s: I agree, strange move.  Maybe he decided to sacrifice S5 and play to surround your corner.]
;B[no]C[I think attacking at P10 would have been better.

s: I think this is ok - splitting your opponents groups is a good move.]
;W[ip]C[Looking back I think not responding to B16 wasn't a good idea for white. Perhaps he intended to sacrifice it.

s: yes, I think so.  It's common for white to play lightly and make sacrafices when playing against a high handicap.  He's counting on you to make a big mistake he can capitalize on.]
;B[pn]LB[jd:A][gp:B]C[s: very slow I think.  Compare this to a move around A or B, both of which are much bigger I think.]
;W[pm];B[oj]C[s: good move - puts preasure on white and makes some moyo potential.]
;W[mm];B[mo]LB[lo:A]C[s: slow again...  A would be better.]
;W[fq]TR[cp]C[s: Great move for white, in my opinion.  It puts preasure on your corner and helps to make a base.  This really exposes the marked stone's weakness.]
;B[eq];W[fn]LB[fp:A]C[s: odd.  The usual play would be A.];B[fp]
C[s: good - the proverb says your opponent's best move is your best move!]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[hq];B[lq]LB[ho:B][jq:A]C[s: Way too small.  I think A would be the right move to attack white and make some territory.  B is perhaps a little more natural - keep white separated.]
;W[eo];B[ep];W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[in];W[jn];B[im];W[jq];B[kr]
LB[jd:A]C[s: seems small with A still open...];W[bo];B[bp]LB[cr:A]
[er:B]C[s: I'm worried about your corner here - what would happen after white A?  You'd have to play to prevent white B - seems like you could live or die pretty easily.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[kn];B[ln]LB[jj:B][jk:A]TR[im][jm][in]C[s: I don't like this move... What is it trying to achieve?  You can't hope to split white while the marked stones are so weak.  Instead I'd jump out with A, or B.]
;W[km];B[lm];W[kl];B[il]C[s: your shape is just terrible here - proof that M6 wasn't good...]
;W[gk];B[ij];W[kj];B[hl];W[gl];B[jk]C[s: this is called a "thank you" move.  Your opponent gets stronger by responding and you get nothing in return.]
;W[kk];B[ic]LB[jc:B][jd:A]TR[ij][jk][hl][il][im][jm][in]C[s: yes, finally! I might have put this at A or B instead, but this is obviously the biggest place to play.  I do worry about your marked group - it's gotten pretty big and is in serious jeopardy.  The rule is usually "urgent" before "big"...]
;W[rk];B[rj]C[Too passive?

s: looks ok to me - it can help you build a big moyo above.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[nk];B[kp]LB[jo:A]C[s: Very odd move.  This doesn't seem to help you at all.  I'm not sure it's even sente.  Seems like white might be able to live below if he lets you play A.]
;W[kq];B[ko];W[jr];B[nj]C[s: I like it - builds nice influence facing the upper side.]
;W[mk];B[mj];W[kg]C[s: great move by white - it threatends the stones caught in the middle and greatly reduces the power of your wall on the center line.]
;B[ih];W[ji];B[hg];W[gi];B[hj];W[nd]LB[pf:A]C[s: a little odd.  I think white would rather split your groups around A.]
;B[pg];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[lc]C[s: good move - attacks white and helps you make a base.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[rd];B[pe];W[rc];B[lf]LB[bd:A]C[s: not sure where this is going exactly.  I think I'd prefer A now.  I've read that vague moves like this in the center are a common mistake of kyu players - they feel big because they feel like fighting moves but there's really very little territory here and there are still lots of big moves available on the board.]

;W[hf];B[jh];W[jo];B[ek]LB[bd:B][dj:A]C[Was this overplay on my part?

s: looks like it to me.  I would expect white to play A next and capture...  I think B is bigger now.]
;W[dj];B[dm]C[s: this does work for you eventually, but it seems like it shouldn't!]
;W[co]LB[dn:A]C[s: bad shape - I think A would be better here.]
;B[bj];W[cm];B[fm];W[gm];B[bl];W[cl];B[gj];W[fj]C[Here was my opportunity to let my stones escape.

s: I'm not sure what you mean - except for white making lots of mistakes your stones should be dead!]
;B[en]
(;W[bd]LB[dn:A]C[s: ouch... not a great time to tenuki!  Obviously now was the time to play A.  I don't think black can escape after that.]

Thx for reviewing the game. I also hope you have suggestions on improving my endgame, if there are any!



FlameinIce3838

s: Your end-game looked decent to me - nothing obviously terrible anyway.  I think you would benefit more from improving your opening, particularly in terms of handicap play.  Also, you may want to be careful to play the biggest moves you can find during mid-game fighting.  Sometimes a play can be attractive to "finish" a position, but it's often the case that there's a much better play available somewhere else on the board.  If you read some professional game you'll find that they tenuki much more often than amateurs - they're always looking for the next big move and they'll take it as soon as they possibly can!

s: I hope you found my review helpful.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  -sam]
