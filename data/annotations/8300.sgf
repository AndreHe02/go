Hi There, I'll do my best to review!

LB[po:A][lp:B][oq:C]C[This move tends to strengthen white. I would either play above (A) to influence the right side, or pincer white (B). The high pincer works nicely with the stones on the bottom left. If you must play in the bottom right, I would prefer C to take a bigger corner.]

Final Comments:

You played good moves, however you often pick the wrong areas to play in. You should practice (after EVERY move) saying to yourself, where is the important area on the board?

Here's is a guideline, go through these steps after every more (credit to shygost for this list)

1.) Am I OK? If any of your stones are in trouble, play there

2.) Is the opponent OK? If any of your opponents stones are in trouble, play there

3.) If not 1 and 2, then play in the big area.

Hope that helps! good luck to you!])
