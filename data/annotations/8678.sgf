C[Dear reviewer,

I added some thoughts and questions. I'm mainly interested in advice on opening and middle game fighting.
Thanks in advance!

In professional games, usually black takes tenuki here.];W[fq]
;B[cf]
(;W[dk]LB[fc:A][dj:B]C[I was thinking that Black did not settle his stones and went for an immediate attack.
Probably calmy playing 'A' would be better? But somehow I was worrying, that this would be to easy on Black (getting to play 'B').

Juan:
I think the idea of a pincer here is correct. However, this pincer is not in the right place because it's too close to black's stronger group, see variations.]

I think this is a bad move by black, a good chance.];W[cj];B[dj]

White gets lucky.];W[gj];B[el];W[fd]C[Upcoming fight seems favorable to me.

Juan:
Your attack on those 2 stones is good, but black can always settle in the corner (at B16 or C17) and the group on the bottom left settled quickly.]

This cut is unreasonable by black, since you have G9 in sente.]

You must play G9 first, see variation.];B[ge];W[gd];B[hh];W[ff]

Black plays a key shape point, I agree it's difficult to kill.]

This move is bad shape, you can use the aji better (see variation)]
;B[bc];W[cb];B[bh];W[bi];B[ch];W[hg]C[I could not find a way to kill the black group. So I was playing this move to connect my stones.

Yes, it's painful to defend like this.];B[ij];W[qn];B[ql];W[qq]

Yes, this move is the wrong direction.];W[qp];B[po];W[rn];B[qi]
LB[om:A][pn:B][lp:C]C[I expected 'A' in this situation. I was a bit uncertain about the best continuations in this situation. 'B' seemed somewhat tempting, but I expected Black 'C' after which Black is settled on both sides.

Juan:
Black overplays even when ahead :-)];W[kp]LB[nc:A]C[Finaly this move seemed natural to me. Or would it be bigger to approach top right at 'A'?

Juan:
This move is good!];B[kq]C[Juan:
Another strange attachment by your opponent];W[lq]LB[jq:A]C['A' seemed submissive to me.

Good, prevents ko.

You played much better yose than your opponent.

Overall, you made some mistakes in the beginning (left side) and in the middlegame (the bottom right) but managed to stay ahead and played some very creative moves.

When a cross-cut happens, it's often better to extend than to atari. Here, the ladder works for you, so I think it's possible.

If black extends from either side, you can capture one of the stones. If black plays atari, you may get a good attack. You can also choose to start a difficult fight.]

A is weaker than B and the upper left corner is under attack. It's better to play a move that pressures the weaker stone, while making it unconfortable for black to settle group B.]

You can tenuki now and leave black with the aji of the peep at A (which could be used to split the groups).
