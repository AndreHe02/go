[je][jf][jg][jh][kd][ke][kf][kg][ld][le][lf]C[Hi,
My main concern on this game is those two marked area where black made territo
y that I could have minimised but I can't see what i've done wrong.

Any other tips would be welcome.

Thanks!

PS : I play White on this game.

M:  Hello!  Thanks for letting me review this game.  I had a lot of fun working through the possibilities.  Any comments of mine will be proceeded by "M:"  As always, please take them with a dose of skepticism:  I'm only 11k.  

M:  About the two marked territories:  Look at the board after move 24.  Black has staked out several bases and has sente to either solidify territory, increase the size of his moyos, or invade white.  The issue is not that white was unable to reduce black's territory -- white did a good job attacking later; it is that white did not have an equal amount of territorial potential.  With move 25, black tears the heart out of white's largest moyo, and there simply isn't enough territory in the center for white to catch up.]

LB[qj:a]C[M:  Since you have taken a high position at the star point at the bottom as well as at Q14, this stone should be at R10 (a) to strike the right balance.]
;B[nq]
(;W[pq]LB[qn:B][np:A]TR[pj]C[M:  This is quite submissive.  It also doesn't protect too much territory, as black can still invade above on lines 6 or 7.  (a) and (b) are both playable alternatives.  See the variation for one possible continuation of (a).]
;B[kq]
(;W[cq]CR[cf][cn][df][dn][fc][fd][fp][fq]C[M:  Much too early for this invasion.  You get a few points of territory, but black gets a tremendous amount of influence.  Any of the marked approach moves are playable, but the ones on the right are more interesting than the approach moves on the top or bottom.  See the var for one possible option.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[bo]
(;B[cr]C[M:  The basic joseki (see var) gives black a better result.]
;W[cn];B[do];W[dn];B[cg];W[dk]CR[cj]C[M:  Extend a bit further from your two stone wall.  Playing on the third line (marked) keeps black from sliding under your stones, as well.]
;B[ql]C[M:  Black finds a good spot for invasion.  At the risk of beating the point to death, this is one reason why R10 would have been better than Q10.]
;W[pl]LB[qj:B][rj:D][rl:A][qn:C][qo:E]C[The only others option I see is "A","B" and "C"  But "A" seems hard to protect, with "B" and "C" I fear an invasion in the center.

M:  (b) and (c) are solid territorially.  (c) takes ~15 points in the corner.  (b) is worth ~18 points on the top right.  If white takes (c), black can jump into the center or to (d).  If white takes (b) or (d), black can play (e) and attack the corner.

M:  The move you played is fine.  Black will get a base on the side, and white will get central influence.]
;B[pm];W[om]LB[pk:C][qk:B][ol:A]C[M:  (a) (the tsuke-nobi) and (b) are both playable here.  This move invites black to wedge in at (c).]
;B[pn];W[on];B[gd]LB[cc:A][qm:B]C[M:  This is the sort of formation that should be invaded at the 3-3 point (a).  Black should not have played tenuki, however.  R7 (b) is big.]

(;W[eo];B[pk];W[ol];B[ok]
(;W[nj]LB[qk:A]C[M:  Cut at (a) (see var).];B[qk];W[nk]C[M:  White has built a wall, but since black has so much access to the center, what is it worth?  Black still has access to both the top and bottom right.]
;B[qo];W[po];B[fq]LB[qj:B][qp:A]C[M:  Black secures his weak group.  A white play at (a) would strengthen the corner, and a play at (b) would strengthen the top right.]
;W[rm]LB[rn:A]C[M:  I'm fairly certain a black play at (a) secures this group against white's attack.]
;B[qm];W[rn];B[qn]LB[ro:A]C[M:  (a) is a better alternative for black.]
;W[ri];B[oj];W[oi];B[qj];W[pi];B[rj]LB[qi:A]C[M:  Black should push through at (a).]
;W[qi]TR[oj][ok][pk][pm][pn][qj][qk][ql][qm][qn][qo][rj]C[Now I'm trying to reduce the territory black's marked stones can occupy, an
d maybe kill them or at least reduce eye space.

M:  Black has been very kind in the past few moves.  White has solidified territory on the top right and will get some of the corner, as well.]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[rl]LB[cc:D][ci:E][gn:B][mo:C][hq:A]C[M:  It's time to pause and consider the board.  Black has a large moyo at the top and top left and a smaller one on the bottom.  Black also has ~8 points of territory on the right.  White has ~17 points on the top right, ~6 in the bottom right corner, and a weak group on the bottom left.  White's wall on the right has several cutting points, as well.

M:  An invasion around H3 (a) would probably succeed in splitting the bottom black groups, but it would strengthen them and may hurt the weak white groups.  A move around G6 (b) is better; it threatens the invasion, increases white's influence in the center, strengthens the weak group, and protects against the cut at E6.  Black will likely respond at H4, giving white sente.  

M:  N5 (c) threatens the black group below and protects against cuts at P5 and O8, strengthening the bottom right corner.  

M:  The 3-3 invasion at the top (d) is still open, though black will get center influence.  

M:  C11 (e) makes some territory on the left side and settles white's group.]
;W[sk]C[M:  This is better left as a large ko threat.];B[sj]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[go]C[M:  Good.  Black increases the size of his moyo and protects against the invasion at H3 with this move.]
;W[di]LB[ci:A]C[M:  This move is better at (a), since black can slide beneath the white stones otherwise.]
;B[eh]LB[cc:A]C[M:  The invasion at C17 (a) is necessary now.  Black will not gain much useful center influence from it.]
;W[ci];B[lo]LB[mf:A][nl:B]C[M:  This move does not do much for black.  A move around N14 (a) increases black's moyo more.  

M:  The cut at O8 (b) continues to be threatening.];W[cc]C[M:  Good!]
;B[dc];W[cd];B[ce];W[be];B[bf];W[bd]
(;B[lf]LB[cb:A]C[M:  Black should first play the sente sequence starting with C18 (a) (see var) to solidify his upper left territory.]

;W[bq]LB[bp:A]C[M:  Should be at (a).];B[gm]C[M:  Good!  Black has done a good job increasing his territory on the bottom.]

;W[kj];B[rb];W[jm]LB[im:A]C[M:  This move is good in that it is on the boundary of the white and black territories.  However, it would be more effective at (a).  Remember the proverb, "Hane at the head of two stones."]
;B[jn];W[im];B[in];W[ln];B[nf]LB[ec:B][rc:A]C[M:  Continue an earlier line of attack at S17 (a) first.  

M:  E17 (b) is a big move, as it protects against white cutting at D15.]
;W[ng]LB[de:A];B[mg];W[nh];B[mi];W[ni];B[mh];W[mj];B[mo];W[no]

;W[de]CR[dc][dd]LB[ec:B][cf:A]MA[ea][eb]C[This move was to force black to play at "A" and capture one of the marked groups.]

;W[fd]LB[ee:A][fe:B]TR[gc][gd]C[I'm not sure if this move is useless or if it's a "free" move since black m
ust anser at "A"

M:  It's a good move, as it breaks further into black's territory.  Black responds at (a), white forces further in with (b).  This move also reduces the liberties of the marked group, so white can push deep on the 18th and 19th rows.]

[jb][jc]C[Here I was trying my best not make a huge mistake that could lead to the capture of my marked stones.

M:  Good!  White has a lot of possibilities (aji) here.  (a) gets white into the center, and white can aim at (b) later to get into the top.  Both of these moves rely on the weakness at (c), which black should protect.]

LB[bn:A]TR[bq][cp][cq]C[M:  The three stones are dead.  (a) threatens to save them.  Likewise, after this move, a black move at (a) kills all five stones and steals some territory.]

M:  I believe that this game was essentially decided by move 50.  At that point, black had solid territory on the top and bottom, a live group on the right side, and had limited white to the top right, left center, and a small bottom right corner.  Hence, I suggest that white study the opening game.  Moves 10, 12, 14, and 24 are particularly suspect.  

M:  White's middle and end game were fairly good.  (More practice with life and death problems always helps, though. :)  Black had staked out several strong groups, however, and I believe black had too large a lead for white to make up.]
