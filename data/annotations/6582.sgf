C[I have won this game. But it was really hard game and I made lots of mistakes. But I still cannot figure out all of my mistakes. Also I am searching for some better moves. Thanks

Zander: I'll be reviewing this game and will try to make some helpful comments.]

C[Zander: This move is too far from the marked stone to use it effectively for support.  Black will be able to build a strong position while White tries to live in the corner.]

(;W[nf]C[Zander: In the game this works out for White, but if Black plays a little looser, it's very hard to live with these stones.  White doesn't have eye space nearby, so will have to run a long way to safety. I think it's better for White to make a larger play elsewhere and come back here only when necessary or as a ko threat.]

;B[lg];W[le];B[jg];W[nq];B[pn];W[pq]C[Zander: This does not seem to be a common play for this joseki. I think it generally works out well for Black, with White ending up with inefficient shape.]

(;B[ie]C[Zander: Black is overextended. There's a good chance to cut at G15, I think.]

(;W[if];B[hf];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[ge]C[Zander: In the variation this cut doesn't work because of the liberty at K15.]

;W[fh];B[je];W[eh];B[gg];W[ii];B[gi];W[hj];B[fj]
(;W[fk]C[Zander:  White needs to be concerned about saving the stones at J12. White seems to have an advantage on territory already, so it's probably not necessary to kill the group at G13 to win. I think it's better for White to save his stones first, then continue to apply pressure as a secondary concern.]
;B[ij];W[jj];B[ik];W[ji];B[hk];W[jk];B[jl];W[kk];B[kl];W[ej]
;B[gj];W[lk]C[Zander: Again, in the game this works out for White, but there isn't really room for White to make eyes with these stones.  White needs to kill something to live, so Black should play loosely with a mind to securing the surrounding groups.  Usually the group at K9 will be dead. I think White should play elsewhere to try to claim as much of the territory in the lower left as is still available, and use these stones for their aji (to threaten the black groups from the other side) and for ko threats.]

;B[oo]C[Watilla [?\]: lol];W[ol];B[ok];W[oj];B[pl];W[oi]C[Zander: From here to the end it's the same as my previous comment.  If Black focusses on securing his own groups instead of attacking, there's not room for White to live.  By this point White has committed to this line of play, but against a stronger opponent would do better to pressure black from the other side to secure territory in the lower left and on the edges.  This ends my comments, I hope they are of some help.]
