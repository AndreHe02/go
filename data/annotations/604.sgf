C[This game is not played out to the end. I have a hard time being able to foresee the destruction of groups and how to protect them. Could you please give me comments on what is wrong with my play, espesially in the attack and defense of groups.



Thanks,

Matthew

;B[dp]C[For what it's worth, I favor opening on the 3-4 point, to avoid a common invasion behind the 4-4 point.  But many very skilled players like the 4-4 point.  And many players do one 3-4, and one 4-4.]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[pp];B[qf];W[mc];B[jc];W[jp];B[pj];W[dj]C[This is a good invasion.  You have plenty of room for branching on either side.]

It may just take practice, but you always want to look ahead at least one step, to see if your opponent can put you in atari on their next move.]

(;B[gp]C[This isn't really a bad move, I was just offering alternatives.  Some would say this is good because, although white is getting the lower edge territory, you're building "thickness" from which you can branch into the center.  Solid lines are strong, things you can jump away from knowing that it's possible to trap your opponent against your thickness.

It's very difficult to make life against your opponent's thickness.]

(;B[as];W[cr];B[cm]C[
This is the right kind of thinking - right after staking out large territories, your goal should be to slice off groups and kill them.  This is a little far from the edge tho.]
;W[bm];B[cl];W[qk]TR[bm][bn][cn][bo][ao]C[This is a case of white deciding they have bigger fish to fry.  The marked stones are in some danger because of this move, but white has staked out a large territory via this move.]
;B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[si];W[rk];B[nq]C[
This is a little bit tight.  It looks good - there's room to branch to the left, or you could invade the corner - but upon playing it out, it doesn't look that good to me.]
