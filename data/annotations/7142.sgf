C[taisei [3k\]: hi
cook777 [4k?\]: Hi

Hello !

I'm your reviewer Thomas.
My comments will begin with [fantomas27\]: as my nickname on kgs is fantomas27.
Mail me or pm me on kgs if you have any question.
I added some general comments at the end of the file.

Thomas];B[pd];W[cd];B[dp];W[qp];B[oq];W[oo];B[mp]C[Should have played R3.

[fantomas27\]: well, that's what the kogo is saying but the sequence they show doesn't convince me that it's good for white.]

(;W[po]
(;B[ed];W[gd];B[ef];W[ec]
(;B[dd]C[Acording to kogo's joseki I should have D17.];W[dc]
;B[ce];W[bc]
(;B[gf]C[B15 better. Because of next move.];W[be]C[This shape seems bad now.]

(;B[qi]
(;W[fq];B[er]TR[mp][op][oq]C[Trying ot use thoughs stones as thickness.
[fantomas27\]:as they are now these stone are not thickness because  they don't have eye shape]

(;W[eq];B[dq];W[fr];B[iq]C[[fantomas27\]:good move because it is an extension-pincering move]
;W[cn]C[[fantomas27\]:this move seems abusive, just creating another weak group.]
;B[eo]C[[fantomas27\]:ok];W[go]
(;B[gp]C[[fantomas27\]:the motto says "don't attach what you are attacking" because it will reinfore your opponent like here.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[hp]LB[gp:A][dr:B][kq:C]C[[fantomas27\]: now by capturing the A stone plus the possibility of playing B, white is nearly alive.
Plus white may have the possibility to play C, that would be troublesome for you.]
;B[gn];W[gq];B[ip];W[io];B[hn]TR[ip]LB[ho:A]C[[fantomas27\]:this move is bad : after white connects at A you get a broken shape]
;W[ho]TR[hn][ip]C[[fantomas27\]:here is broken shape, this result is clearly not good for you.]

(;B[jo];W[in]TR[hn][jo]C[[fantomas27\]:broken shape again.]
;B[jn];W[im]C[[fantomas27\]:what did you gain with your last move ?
you only got a bad shape];B[cl]TR[im]C[[fantomas27\]:now the triangled stone will help white a lot in this fight]
;W[dl];B[dk];W[el];B[cm];W[dn];B[dm]LB[ck:A]C[[fantomas27\]: this move will only create a weakness at A. Since you can't cut, don't push.]
;W[en];B[fn]TR[dm]C[[fantomas27\]:broken shape again];W[em]

(;B[gl]C[[fantomas27\]:If you want to attack a group, you have to be strong, so you have first to defend your weakness before jumping here.]
;W[ck]C[[fantomas27\]: Now that is not black that is attacking white but white that is torturing the black group]
;B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[di]C[[fantomas27\]:now black is crawling on the 2nd line while white takes influence plus a black stone]
;B[ci];W[dj];B[ek];W[bn]C[[fantomas27\]: moreover, now you corner look not that strong.]
;B[al];W[am];B[bl];W[fk];B[ej];W[ch]C[cook777 [4k?\]: ah I see]
;B[bi];W[dh];B[bh];W[fi]LB[gl:A][bp:B]C[[fantomas27\]: now white's group is absolutly alive and black A stone seems useless (would be better at B for example).]
;B[cg];W[cf];B[bf];W[de];B[dg];W[af];B[bg];W[ee];B[hk]LB[bp:A]
C[[fantomas27\]:i would prefer to play A, with A your group become alive and it is also very big move]
;W[jl];B[fh]C[[fantomas27\]:useless, white's group is already alive]
;W[ei];B[hi];W[bq];B[bp];W[do];B[cp];W[ep]C[I missread how bad the cut was for me.]
;B[br];W[hl];B[hm];W[il];B[gk]LB[fh:A][ei:B]C[[fantomas27\]: you can this that is you hadn't played the A for B exchange, your last move would be sente. This is a perfect example of a bad kikashi (=forcing moves).]
;W[gh]
(;B[fg]C[[fantomas27\]: you don't have to save this stone];W[gi]
;B[hh]LB[hg:A]C[[fantomas27\]: you still have a weakness at A]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[fl];B[gm];W[hj];B[ij];W[gj];B[ik];W[ii];B[jj]
;W[hg];B[ih];W[ig];B[jh];W[gg];B[je]C[[fantomas27\]: a very vague move : it doesn't close white, doesn't help black to get out nor take territory]
;W[jg];B[li];W[kh];B[ji];W[hf];B[ag]C[[fantomas27\]: a very humiliating move but you have no choice.]
;W[ll];B[mj]TR[qn][rn][sn][pr][ps][hc][hb][ha][ad][fd]SQ[cs]
[cr][ap][or][os][ir][is][no][mo][lo][ko]C[[fantomas27\]: Let's count a bit.
Imagine triangles are white stones and squares black stones : they show the amount of definite territory both players have.
White : 23(top left) + 7 (left) + 14(lower right) = 44 points
Black : 7(lower left) + 4(left) + 19(lower side) = 40 points
We can't say where the points  are at the top right area, so we simply don't count them, but we have to think about it for the evaluation.
Evaluation : based on pure territory, your are behind, but if we think about this top right area then you are clearly ahead.]
;W[md]TR[je]C[[fantomas27\]: I think this move is a very good move : it invades black's area and attacks black marked stone at te same time.
since you are definitively behind after the sequence beginning with this move (and the fact you were ahead before), the reason of you losing the game is how you answered this move.]

(;B[pc]C[[fantomas27\]: i think this move is the problem, this is your
moyo so you have to be more offensive];W[nc];B[mg]C[[fantomas27\]: i can't find a way to save k15 without too much damage]
;W[lf];B[mf];W[me];B[lg];W[kf];B[oe]C[[fantomas27\]: you sure won some points but white as well and white has sente.
Please compare with the P17 move i showed you

cook777 [4k\]: Thank you for the game.

[fantomas27\]: This was a good game for both players, very close untill the move 126 where white played an axcellent move that gave him victory.
My advice for you for further improvement is to study shapes. I noticed this is your weakest point as you made a lot of shape mistakes.
To study shapes, you have to study tsumegos and/or play teaching games with high dan players that will teach you.

I hope you enjoyed this review.
