C[Hi! Thanks for taking the time to go over my game. I played black on this game, and although I feel that the reason I lost (or at least the reason I lost badly) lies on some tactical mistakes, I am mainly interested on any mistakes in direction.
Again, thanks for your time.

JS:
Thanks for the opportunity to comment your game. Just so you understand, only a high ranking pro knows the truth about the go game. My comments are only useful to stimulate your own thinking in different ways. Please enjoy the useful comments and discard the rest.

John Stephenson March 2004];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq]C[JS:
F3: fast opening move. No problem.];W[eq]C[JS:
E3: this attachement is only right if it makes black heavy and easy to attack; here it "forces" black to be stronger.]
;B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[I was happy with this result, good for black, right?

But is the keima (white 8, C6) a reasonable move? What is the disadvantage against the usual tobi at D6? I mean, I know it puts less pressure on black, but it does protect the corner better, right?

JS:
It is more defensive, which is right in this case since White cannot easily attack black's group on the bottom.  (Of course, E3 is the culprit.) The bad aji that remains in the lower left corner makes the white position inefficient. I.e., C8 could be sente.]
;W[lp]C[JS:
M4: too early. Should be 3rd line if play in this locale. White should be more interested in a base here. 3rd line is for base making versus the 4th line for moyo and influence building (which White cannot do on the bottom).]
;B[np]LB[oq:b][nq:a]C[A or B better?

JS:
That is hard for me to exactly say. A is the "obvious" move, in that it both helps the corner and threatens to connect underneath. B is tighter and still makes the white stone into a floater. O4 tries to emphasizes maximum pressure. In general pincer a 4th line stone on the 4th line and a 3rd line stone on the 3rd line. Maybe P4, yet another alternative, leaves less aji in the corner. 

If I'm the black stone player, I'm playing "a" normally and "b" if I am having a smart day.]
;W[jq];B[iq];W[kq]C[JS:
L3: now White has made his position heavy. Before, with a single stone on the 4th line, white had the option to sacrifice it to gain a benefit nearby. White cannot sacrifice the 3 stones, its too much.]
;B[in]C[This is wrong, I think.

JS:
It is slack. The reason is because the heavy white group can now easily secure a base with J2, so white may fix the liability he created for himself.

A move like J6 is good when you are in the enemy zone and need a light flexible move for defense. In this moment you should think pressuring the heavy white group and not defending. So you want to deny the white group an easy base.

(Remember the 3 fundamentals of the go game: liberties, connection, base. Everything comes from that.)]
;W[nd]C[JS:
O16: really bad. First of all, white cannot leave the urgency on the bottom. Second this high approach to 4-4 is only right if White has good moyo potential, which I cannot see.]
;B[pf]C[JS:
Q14: good. Answer an unusual move (O16 is an unusual approach) so it does not become better than normal. Sometime you must answer an unusual move with an unusual move, but here Q14 is perfect.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[qb];W[kd];B[cf]C[JS:
C14: sorry. You should play URGENT before BIG. This is a fundamental thing in the go game. And urgency exists when there are problems with any/all of the 3 fundamental I mentioned:

1. liberties short?
2. connection weak?
3. base gone?

The bottom white group has no base. Punish it right away to gain some benefit. Otherwise white may somehow fix it later and you lose the opprotunity. Consider J2 or N3. Drive it out while taking cash.

As far as the top and left, although the left is more open (bigger) than the top, J17 exploits white's open top-right position.]
;W[ce]C[JS:
C15: a pointless attachment again.];B[df];W[fd];B[dj]C[Maybe low?

JS:
Yes, C10 would be better. The reason is that you are in the white zone on the left; you like a base better than center influence when in the enemy zone.]
;W[bj]C[B10: white tries to punish your move right away. C8 would be better locally. It has good follow up and strengthens White's lower corner position.]
;B[ci]C[JS:
C11: really painful to make this move, isn't it? White just played a 2nd line move early. Can you press him down and separate him somehow? Think about C7 or C8 or even D7 to link up everbody; since you did D10 you already said a story that you don't want cash on the left but rather influence. Keep your story consistent in the go game and you can never be far behind.]
;W[ck];B[el];W[dm];B[cc]C[JS:
C17: not enough. The biggest defect on the top for white is J17; its urgent. White left himself with a group that can be opened on both ends and attacked.]
;W[dc];B[be]
(;W[cd]C[JS:
C16: better at B16.];B[bd];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[hd]C[Right time to invade? Right place?

JS:
It is good timing. Not exactly the right spot. You can invade the 3rd line closer to the weaker white group (J17). When invading play close to the weaker opponent position, not the stronger.

In go, what exactly is good timing? It is doing something at the last possible moment right before the opportunity could be lost completely.]

JS:
S15: you must protect your base. You're right. It's urgent. That White gets this forcing slider is his partial compensation for having you build up the bottom right.]
;W[nq]C[O3: just in time. But black gets a big corner benefit.]
