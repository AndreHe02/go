C[Reviewed by Joe Carl (1K* KGS) all my comments will be preceeded by JC:

Hello ! I was black in this game. My feeling about this game is that I had the advantage in approx. the first half of the game, and then it slowly (?) went away; and that my play was much less good in the second half. Is this true ?

I am particularly intersested about big directions of the games, strategical errors, big moves missed and so on.
I guess this game is rather typical of my strength : I did not play exceptionnaly well or bad.

I have put one or 2 comments in the game.


Thank you very much for your help,

Cosima];B[qo]C[Cosima [8k\]: have a nice game];W[dp];B[qd];W[op]
C[JC: This is the wrong direction for White.  Empty Corners are the biggest move.]
;B[oc]C[JC: This is the wrong direction as well.  Taking the empty corner is bigger.]
;W[qi]C[JC: The empty corner is still the biggest move.]
(;B[pq]C[JC: Empty Corner still.  But if black want to play here he should play as in the variation.]
;W[dc];B[ce];W[dh]C[JC: The top side is uninteresting.  Black is already on the 3rd line in the top right and White is also on the 3rd line in the top left.  Nothing big will develop on the top side.  To build a wall facing it is wrong.]

(;B[ee]C[JC: Since building a wall is wrong, trying to run away is also wrong.  Just settling would be best.  See variation]

(;W[fc]
(;B[cn]C[JC: This is a bad move.  Black only has one weak group on the board, and now he just made a second.  If white plays properly, White can patch up all his troubles and leave black with 2 weak groups and white will have none.  Black should just settle his stones in the upper left.]

(;W[fp]C[JC: This is the wrong direction for white.  See variation]

(;B[ck]C[JC: Right idea but if your going to play this, then slide to B4 first.  See variation.]

(;W[fh]C[JC: White should make black heavy first. See variation.]

(;B[qg]C[JC: Wrong direction.  It pushes white towards his other weak stone.  See variation]

(;W[ge]C[JC: This attacks, but really doesn't develop any territory.  Thus this is the wrong direction.  See variation.]
;B[cg];W[oe]
(;B[og]C[JC: Black should just stay connected and take territoy.  White is leaving weak stones everyplace.  He can't win this game unless you give him a chance to by making mor weak groups then him.  See variation.]
;W[qe]
(;B[lc]C[JC: This is very bad.  Black just created a weak group and then leaves it alone.  See variation.]
