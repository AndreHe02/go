C[" I was Black in this particular game and am curious about 3 points  in the game.  At move 75 I am not sure where my strongest move should have  been.  I went to secure the upper left but I think that was out of fear.  I  am thinking at move 78 I should have moved to the center from R11 and then  again especially as late as move 112.  My opponent said I was leading even  at 202 but it seems I was to far gone and couldn't connect anymore.  If I  was in the lead how could I have cut my losses or even win at that point of  the game?"

Hi.  I'll try to answer your questions.  I hope you find my review useful.  My apologies in advance if some of my comment sseem a little brisk.

Bear in mind that I'm not that strong a player myself, so if you disagree with my comments you should always prefer to play your own way.

If you have any questions about my comments, feel free to email me.

(;B[qo]C[This seems bad; certianly it didn't work out too well.  The joseki move is at P2. (see variation)]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[qn];B[rn];W[qp];B[qf]C[Black has taken a big loss in the lower right corner.]
;W[qd]C[I don't thnik this is too good. O16 or O17 would be better, or a pincer at R11 or R12 (which is also an extension from White's position on the lower right.)]
;B[mc]C[Now the White corner doesn't seem secure.];W[nc];B[cd]
C[It seems strange to just let that contact play in the upper right sit there.  Standing at N16 looks good, or perhaps the hane at O16.]
;W[ro]C[I don't think White needed to play here.  Perhaps he should play in the upper right himself.]
;B[ck]C[This is a good point for Black, but I think the upper right is still more urgent.]
;W[of]C[This feels like the wrong direction.  A pincer against the R14 stone (at R11 or R12) would be more severe.]
;B[qi]C[Good, establishing a base for Black on the right side.]
;W[md]C[White finally plays here, and it seems hard on Black.  See how different the upper right would look if Black had played at this point?]
;B[kc];W[lc];B[lb]C[Perhaps Black could stand at L16 here?  Then he has a nice formation extending from both sides of his corner enclosure in the upper left.]
;W[ld];B[mb]C[Also here, I wonder if L16 would be bigger than saving the N17 stone.]
;W[kd]C[Now White presses Black down on the upper side.];B[jc]
;W[cq]C[This works out pretty well, but White could also consider K16 or J16, continuing to press.]

(;B[dq]C[Black could also block on the other side, and that might be better for him. See variation.]
;W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[dr];B[er];W[cr]
(;B[iq]C[I think White can exploit the cutting points left behind by this move.

Of course if Black completes the joseki with F3, White would play arond L3 and Black's wall on the left would belargely neutralized.  (see variation)]

(;W[lq]C[I think that White could do better by cutting at E3 (variation).]
;B[eq]C[Black's J3 stone may be too close to his thickness, by the way.]
;W[jp];B[io]C[This seems too loose.  J3 or K3 might be better.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[hq]
(;B[hr]C[Maybe descending to J2 is stronger. (see variation)]
;W[gq];B[gp];W[ir];B[gr];W[jq];B[fq]C[This is small, I think.]
;W[do];B[dn];W[jn];B[hn]C[J6 is OK.];W[in];B[hl];W[eo];B[fp]
C[unnecessary.  White isn't really threatening anything.];W[iq]
C[Small.];B[fn]C[unnecessary.  White still has no visible threats.]
;W[gm]C[This does not work.];B[hm];W[gn];B[dh]C[Good.  You don't have to add any more stones on the lower side right now.  K16 is also good.

So far, I think Black is doing well, despite the loss on the lower right.  His territory extending from the upper leftcorner  coud be quite large, and this helps solidify it.]
;W[kl]C[K16 (or maybe better L16) seems bigger.];B[hi]C[K16 would also be a good point for Black.]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[kb]C[H16 is stronger.  No need to fear.]
;W[dg]C[White needs to invade Black's big framework, but this should not work.]
;B[fe]C[Bad.  This gives White chances to make trouble.  The hane on top at E13 looks good;  White will have trouble trying to live, then.

(Dealing with the invasion is much bigger than moving into teh center from R11, by the way.)]
;W[ch];B[eg];W[eh]C[Now White has good chances to live in the middle of your moyo!]
;B[ei]C[bad.  Pull back out of the atari. (D11)  Then White must still struggle.]
;W[di];B[fh];W[dh]C[I think there are better moves,  C15 for example.]
;B[ej];W[fg];B[ff]C[Again abandoning an important stone.];W[gg]
C[Should just take at E14, I think..];B[ef];W[gh];B[gi]TR[fh]
C[The stone left in atari is the one cutting the left group off from the center.  White may have difficulty living now  if you draw back to F11 instead.

If White does live without Black getting compensation elsewhere, White will be well ahead.]
;W[ig]C[W should take.];B[rm]C[This is a big move, actually, but I think F11 is still bigger.]
;W[qm];B[rl];W[ql];B[rj]C[ R9 is better;  then Black's right side group is perfectly secure.]
;W[qk]C[Now White has various threats against the right-side group.]
;B[oi]C[OK, although I still think F11 is more urgent.];W[rk]
;B[sk];W[qj];B[ri];W[ph];B[pi];W[qg];B[rg];W[pf];B[re];W[rd]
;B[ok]C[Here, a jump like N11 is probably better.  F11 is still best, though, I think.]
;W[ii];B[nm]C[It seems White can cut this.];W[ol];B[nl];W[nk]
;B[mk];W[nj];B[ml]TR[mk][nl][nm]C[You should treat the marked stones lightly.  Someting like K10, or N11 or O11 would give White more to worry about.]
;W[om]C[O11 is better if White wants to play around here.];B[ni]
;W[hj]C[Here, N10 is vital.];B[gj]C[No.  N10 catches two White stones, links up Black's groups, and destroys W's center.  Then Black is still doing OK event if white's invasion group on the left lives.]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[gk];B[fk];W[il];B[fm]C[waste of time.  White has no threats here  yet.  N10 has been the biggest point for the last several moves.]
;W[jo]C[Waste of time.];B[go]C[Not needed.];W[mj]C[Finally!  Now  B can't link up on the right. All the by-play in the left center means that B has fewer threats to push out that way, either.]
;B[mh]C[Interesting move, threatening to play M10 which might link up,  and also taking away some potential White territory.]
;W[fi]C[Now W plays this!  Now if M10 doesn't link up, White is ahead.]

(;B[fj]C[Waste of time.  M10 gives Black more chances.  (see variation)]
;W[fh];B[mi]C[wrong way!  This forces White to make a vital strong move.  M10 was still possible.]
;W[lj]C[Now Black can never link up, and the game is very difficult for him.]
;B[mf];W[ne];B[he];W[hd];B[gf]C[not meaningful];W[ie];B[gc]

;W[kj];B[ij]C[might be bigger to link your groups with L13.]
;W[li];B[ik];W[jj];B[jk];W[kk];B[me];W[le]C[This is the point where your opponent thought you were still ahead.  Lets see.  Black's lower left group is worth about 20 points, and the upper side group about 25 or 30, and the right side 5 or less, so Black has about 50.  White's territory in the lower right quarter of the board alone is 60 points, plus the upper right corner and upper center  is about 15 points and  the lower left is maybe 8.  So White is way ahead even if Black could live in the lower left corner, which he can't.

What turned the game around was White living on the left side in what was Black's sphere of influence while Black failed to save his group around O7 and destroy White's center.  If either of those went Black's way, he'd be fine.]

;B[lo];W[se];B[so]C[ bad.  White's last move must be answered, I think.  T14 T16 T12 lives.]
;W[sp];B[sq]C[meaningless at the moment];W[sn];B[sl]C[T14 is vital.]
;W[rq]C[bad.  Black must play T14 now...];B[rr];W[sr]C[Or now...]
;B[mp];W[sf]C[Now the whole Black right side is dead.];B[rf]
;W[sg];B[sh];W[sd];B[nf];W[qe]C[not needed];B[og]C[no help.  After this,you still need to play P12 AND T10 to live--there's no time!

P12, by the way, makes one eye, and White would have to throw in at T10 to kill you; so P12 would make a good Ko threat.  *This* move could be ignored.]
;W[rh];B[si];W[rg]C[not needed.  There is nowhere Black can make two eyes on the right.]
;B[cl];W[an];B[nr];W[or];B[nq];W[mo];B[nn];W[mp];B[os];W[mr]
;B[ns];W[ps]C[The game had its ups and downs, but you were doing OK up to White's invasion at move 76.  It looks to me like you need to wor on tactics, especially on conecting and separating stones.    Best of luck!]

(;B[ir];W[gp];B[ho];W[gq];B[gr]C[It seems Black can link up this way, and a big fight develops]

On the other hand, White doesn't have as much potential atthe bottom as in that variation.]
