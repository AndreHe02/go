C[[dwheeler\] hi, I hope my review is helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

first, you said you lost because of short time limits and that you ran out of time, so I looked up your game online to see how much time you spent on each move. I notice that your opponent had only used 5 minutes to your 15. playing with short time limits can be good. it helps you not overthink and second guess yourself too much, playing mostly by instinct. the more you play, the better your instinctive skills will become. You have to learn to pace yourself in order to have enough time for the end of the game.

most of your moves you played in only a second or two. I noted a few places where you spent long thinking times.

second, you were thrown off by your opponent's "box like" play. that's ok, but don't be lured into playing your opponent's game. play your own game. learn to make the best moves regardless of what your opponent does, which often means ignoring their moves completely, and maybe even sacrificing a few of your own stones in the process.

third, you seemed more intent on surrounding and capturing blacks groups, instead of making territory

Go is not about capturing. Go is about efficiency. Go is a territory game. trying to surround the most territory using the fewest number of moves (most efficient). force your opponent to make inefficient and unnecessary plays, and suddenly you'll find yourself ahead]

(;W[jc]LB[jp:A][jq:B][nq:C]C[[dwheeler\] black is beginning to build a large territorial moyo. you'll want to prevent that by invading there while you still can survive in that area.]

(;W[dj];B[mm];W[nj];B[gk];W[gj];B[mk];W[mj]
(;B[ee]LB[ed:B][de:A][gp:C][jp:D][nq:E]C[[dwheeler\] see, black thinks your area is larger than his, so he invades. but this is not the best way for black to invade

you should first defend your corner/side area. perhaps at A is best, aiming to keep your center stones connected

his move is inefficient. you can easily ignore it for now and go after something bigger (like anything along the bottom)]

(;W[fe]C[[dwheeler\] wrong side];B[de];W[ed];B[ce];W[cd];B[ef]
CR[ej][fj]LB[eh:A][gp:B]TR[gj][gk]C[[dwheeler\] be mindful of the cut between your two center stones, especially since one of your stones has already been weakened by the touching stone

you end up driving black, helping black to cut and separate your stones

instead, realize that black's group is floating, it has no base and no eyes. you don't have to capture it, but you can make yourself stronger by chasing it to death

but there's also the huge open area at the bottom (k4 area), and it will soon become more difficult to invade]

(;W[ff];B[eg];W[fg]LB[fj:A];B[eh]LB[fi:A][cl:B]C[he makes boxes like this and they threw me off because i had never seen anyone play like that.  He does this later as well.

[dwheeler\] you are pushing him from behind. he will always be one step ahead like this. you need to jump out ahead

his moves are slow and inefficient. by jumping out ahead, you will make faster more efficient moves. remember, this is a game about territory, not about capturing. once his group gets 5+ liberties, it will become much more difficult, if not almost impossible to capture]

(;W[gd]C[[dwheeler\] not necessary to protect this cut now (if ever) because both your white groups are strong there]
;B[ei];W[ej];B[fj]TR[dj][ej]C[[dwheeler\] you need to realize now that these two stones are very much in danger of dying (if not already dead)]

(;W[gi];B[fi];W[gh];B[fk]C[[dwheeler\] the black group is now safe, there's no way you can surround and capture it now. (shouldn't be worried about trying to capture it anyway)]

(;W[ek]LB[gp:A]C[[dwheeler\] these stones are lost, leave them. don't throw more lost stones at them

instead, go after something bigger];B[dk]
(;W[di];B[dl];W[dh];B[dg];W[cf]C[18

[dwheeler\] you spent a long time thinking about this move. its not a very good move. it serves no purpose. its isolated and difficult to get connected with your other groups, and it doesn't threaten anything]
;B[cg];W[be];B[bf]
(;W[bd]LB[gp:A]C[17

[dwheeler\] you spent a long time on this move too

this move is very good. keep connected. but this move should almost be automatic for you - no need to think too long about it - you spent at least 5-6 times more thinking time on this move than most of your other moves up to this point

however, its only one stone, and you can afford to sacrifice it for larger moves elsewhere]
;B[bg];W[ch]C[12];B[el];W[bh]C[29];B[ag];W[ah]TR[bh][ch][dh]
[di][dj][ej][ek]C[here i wanted to take the largest section of his on the left. is it too late for this?  i couldn't figure out how to take the bottom part because i would walk into a net at f8 and i didn't know how to go around without being cut off the bottom half entirely.

[dwheeler\] yes its too late, and you're thinking of this wrong. you don't want to capture his stones. I don't even see how you can. Instead you want to take more territory - elsewhere.

right now, your white stones are dead. there is no way for them to survive. and black's stones are completely safe. there is no way to completely surround and capture them

you need to learn to recognize when your stones are lost and his are safe and not waste more moves in this area. go make larger territory in other areas.]

(;W[hk]LB[am:A]C[64

[dwheeler\] you took the most time on this move. practice tsumego (go problems) and you'll be able to recognize the life and death status of your groups a lot quicker

playing at A would have saved your group];B[am];W[hm];B[ck]
;W[fl]C[45

[dwheeler\] another long thinking time, and it looks like you still think you can capture black's upper group - but you can't.]
;B[bi];W[gl]C[22];B[ai];W[hl]C[13

[dwheeler\] not necessary. your stones are not in danger. you need to make a bigger play elsewhere]
;B[fm]
(;W[in]C[16

[dwheeler\] feels too slow to me. a one space jump here could help you develop your invasion a lot faster]
;B[em]
(;W[gn]C[[dwheeler\] again too slow. go is about efficiency. making the most territory with the fewest number of moves. you need to move out and expand quicker]
;B[go];W[fn]LB[ho:A]C[[dwheeler\] I would have played on the other side]
;B[fo]
(;W[hn]C[[dwheeler\] don't backtrack and fill in until you are forced to. keep expanding and pressuring black]
;B[en];W[ho];B[eo]
(;W[hp]LB[iq:A]C[[dwheeler\] too slow];B[gp]
(;W[hq]LB[qg:A]C[here i used his strategy to block off that powerful group.  i don't know if that was the right thing, but it seemed like it because i thought there was no way to take it.

[dwheeler\] you need to quit thinking about trying to capture black's groups. black is going to get some territory. let him have his territory. you just want to make sure you have a little more 

by now, you've completely recovered from your earlier loss and could easily be way ahead. time to secure and defend what you've got (R13 is like cash money in the bank)]
;B[gq];W[hr]LB[mc:F][qg:D][rm:E][lp:B][lq:A][nq:C];B[gr]
(;W[hs]C[[dwheeler\] too soon, and too small

playing on the first line should be left for the endgame, as the value of these moves are so very small

but if you're going to play this now, then at the very least you should have pushed into his territory a little, taking away a couple of his points]
;B[gs];W[fh]C[24

[dwheeler\] wow, another long think time - and this move was dame (useless)

it doesn't gain any points for you, nor does it take any away from black.]

(;W[hh];B[ii]C[i liked this i was surprised he didn't know the ladder, but i guess he learned it quickly enough.

[dwheeler\] you could have actually captured black in a net (I often miss those myself). otherwise, very good reading]
;W[ji];B[ih];W[ig];B[jh];W[kh];B[ml];W[jg]LB[qg:B][rm:A][nq:C]
C[[dwheeler\] oooooh, nooooo. no need to capture them now. they are already captured (they can't escape even if black continued to try).

although, I could be wrong about this -- I just this week read where one should capture stone in a ladder as soon as possible.

I would have waited];B[lm];W[kj]C[14

[dwheeler\] what did this move do for you? there is nothing that needs protecting here (your stones are already connected). it does not gain you any more territory. you are not threatening to take anything away from black.]
;B[km];W[jl];B[jm];W[nl]C[22

[dwheeler\] don't attach to a stronger group (it has more liberties). now your stone is very, very weak and you will not be able to surround and capture it (by now, I think I know what you're thinking)]

;B[ko];W[jp]LB[kp:A][lr:B]C[once again i use his technique to get some space and make life.

[dwheeler\] but you're not getting enough space. you could get even more - especially because you're already alive (you are connected to the top groups)]
