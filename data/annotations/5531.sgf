C[JonR [24k\]: hi

Hello. First of all, well done for having such a good first 19x19 game. It is good to see that you are not afraid to make separate groups.

Secondly, I'd like to go over a few points that i think will help your play. The list is no means exhaustive, but it'll help.]
;B[pd]C[LucidMonk [?\]: hi thank you for playing with me];W[dp]
;B[dd];W[pp]C[JonR [24k\]: hi your welcome brb making a sandwich
JonR [24k\]: im back];B[jj];W[pj];B[dj];W[jq]C[Playing  somewhat equally divided around the board in the beginning is a good start.]
;B[jd];W[pg];B[pf];W[qg];B[qf];W[rf];B[re];W[sf];B[rg]C[JonR [24k\]: where do you live???
LucidMonk [?\]: New Hampshire

;B[fn];W[go];B[hn];W[en]C[JonR [24k\]: why do take so long , im not trying to be rude]
;B[ho]C[LucidMonk [?\]: I'm new and I am usually way to impulsive with my moves. I am trying to break that habit. Too fast for me means too many stupid mistakes. Sorry.]
;W[gp]C[LucidMonk [?\]: Even being slow I am sure I will make stupid mistakes. :-)
JonR [24k\]: ok];B[em];W[dn];B[dm];W[cm];B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[bk]
;B[cn]TR[cl][cm]C[Here. the squared stone is threatening to capture the triangled stones. It takes some experience to recognise it, but you can think of it this way:
-why is black playing there? black is cutting W stones, surely there must be some ulterior motive behind it.]

(;W[co]LB[cl:A]C[It's good you are trying to capture the B stone before it wreaks havoc, but you must atari from the other direction. This ensures that A gets enough liberties to fight against B.]
;B[bn];W[bo];B[bl];W[ao];B[bm]C[LucidMonk [?\]: see stupid mistake ;-)
LucidMonk [?\]: good move];W[sg]C[JonR [24k\]: ya it is
JonR [24k\]: but you need to watch my moves
LucidMonk [?\]: how do you mean? Explain?];B[bj];W[mp]C[JonR [24k\]: see i moved too b10
LucidMonk [?\]: I see that but I can't save it
JonR [24k\]: no that is a bad example];B[ak]C[JonR [24k\]: i cant explane it
LucidMonk [?\]: okay];W[pm];B[og];W[oh]C[JonR [24k\]: ask some one else after this game ok]
;B[nh]C[LucidMonk [?\]: okay I will. I will put this in for a review
JonR [24k\]: ok];W[oi];B[se];W[ni];B[mi]TR[ng][mh]C[B is playing dangerously here. Look at all those cuts.]

(;W[mg]C[Good idea. But be more direct. no namby pamby business when cutting. Nice and clean does the trick.]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[of]TR[mg][ng]C[Now your W stones are cut off from your other stones.  All alone and if it is to live, it must make 2 eyes by itself.

Lesson here is:
Getting separated from your big safe groups can be dangerous. Unless you can find a way to connect back or make 2 eyes, then you will have a hard time making it live.

[ ! \]: having stones that can easily connect to each other is good. 
(you will learn that as you play, so i won't go into that in much detail.)]

It's good to protect your stones, but it is also a good idea to think about whether they need to be protected immediately. 
In this instance, you don't need to protect immediately, because you can always capture B.]

-before capturing the theatening stone, make sure your stones that are required to capture it are not in danger themselves. (in other words, make sure the opponent can't capture your stones to safety.)]
