C[Hi Jeromin,

My comments are marked throughout. If I added comments to yours, mine are the one's below the dashed line (----------------).

A couple of points on terminology that I will use. I will make reference to frameworks and to territroy. They are not the same thing. A framework is a group of stones that map out POTENTIAL territory. It's not a sure thing yet. 

By contrast, territory is that area mapped out by a secure group of stones. It is fairly secure.

I HIGHLY recommend referring to the Sensei's Library for more information on all the topics I address here. You can find it online at senseis.xmp.net. Just type in a topic to find more information.]
;B[dp]C[Hi, this is a game I won in spite of terrible tactics, simply because my oponent new even less strategy! Any advice welcome. I'm Jeromin, playing white.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dd]C[This is a standard opening. But you should know that the 4-4 point (or star point) does not settle the corner. This one stone alone is not enough to claim the corner. But one advantage of the star point is that it is easy to expand into the middle of the broad from it.]
;B[jp]C[Black is staking out a big side framework here. It can still be invaded in many ways. Follow the variants to see a couple.]

(;W[qn]C[This approach move I do because I've seen it done, no idea on the follow up.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Don't worry too much about copying moves you don't understand. I do it all the time. Every kyu player does it despite the "stern warnings" against playing moves you don't understand. It's the way we learn.

The idea with an approach move is 2-fold. First, you want to limit the expansion of your opponent's corner. We play in corners first because it is easiest to make territory in a corner. The second goal is to stake out your own framework as well.]
;B[nq]C[Black responds nice and safely. The variation shows White's standard moves.]

(;W[on]C[Extending up into the middle is not recommended here. You need to extend along the side first. Provide a base for your stones before stepping into the middle of the board. Without a base, your stones can be attacked. See the variations from move 7 and 8.]

(;B[qp]C[Black is playing small ...];W[mo];B[mp];W[op];B[oq]
;W[lp]C[Black makes a mistake here that you exploit. Good Job. But your attacks at N5 and M4 are not the best strategy at this point in the game. You give black a lot of local strength in exchange for some points on the side. 

The variation shows Black's best response to your moves. The outcome gives black a solid position and some good cutting points against your wall.]

(;B[oo];W[mq];B[np];W[kq];B[jq];W[jr]C[Again here, Black can cut your stones into 2 smaller, weaker groups.]

(;B[ir];W[lr];B[mr];W[lq];B[ls];W[nr];B[js];W[ms];B[kr];W[ks]
;B[jr];W[ls];B[or];W[ro]C[Again, small move. You make the right move locally. But you are not strengthening your group in the process. 

White's bottom group is still in danger. See variation.]

C[Be careful with the diagonals near the edge (on the 3rd, 2nd and 1st lines).]

------------------

The wall is nice ... it has potential. But it is not territory. You need to use its strength to carry the game. I'm still learning that too :-). I recommend the sensei's section on Thickness.]

C[Don't know  how to do invasions. looked like a good spot, no idea how to continue.


--------------------------------------------------
Attack and Defense is a difficult topic, very complex. From my read, Black's territory looks pretty secure. A better invasion point might be B3. You threaten to connect to your stones at B6. While black fights against that connection, you MIGHT be able to make life in the lower left corner. But its risky. 

Rather than invade, you would to better to reinforce your remaining corner. You are ahead in points. When you are ahead, play defensively. There's no need to pick fights. Let Black take the big risks, it's the only way he can win at this point.]

;B[gc]C[Okay, Black invades. See variation.]
(;W[fc]C[this group grew too big in spite of my two walls, i think


-------------------------------------
Here's a key principle of Attack and Defense. 
To attack, play non-contact moves. To defend, play contact moves. 

In this situation, you want to attack that invading black stone. The best attack is to limit its space. When you make an attaching move, you almost always make the opponent's stones stronger by extending from that stone. You then need to waste moves defending your attached stone giving your opponent time to make life.

Don't give your opponent weak stones to attack.  I'm not staying that you can definitely kill the invasion. But you'd be less likely to give your opponent life. See variation.]

-------------------------------------------------------

Congrats on the win. You managed your one group well, using its strength to limit your opponent's attacks. In the end, you have one giant territory. That is a risky strategy to take because all your eggs are in one basket as it were. A safer course is to have 2-3 stable groups and use their strength to stage attacks and reductions of your opponent.

This strategy requires that you play around the board. Check out Sensei's Library or whatever Go books you might have on topics like:

Side extensions, Thickness, Corner enclosures, and Attack and Defense. 

Sensei's Library has good basic introductions to these topics as well as a Beginner's Course of study. 

Feel free to ask any questions you might have or drop me a note or a message over at KGS. I'm Hikertrash there. I'd be happy to go over this game in some more detail or play a practice game, whatever.

Good Gaming!
