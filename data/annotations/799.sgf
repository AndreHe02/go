C[fess: I felt pretty bad about the opening of this game, but felt that I caught up near the end of the middle game, to lose in the endgame.
I have a feeling that if I can understand what went right or wrong for me in this game, that I will learn a lot.]

;B[ld]C[black is a bit exagerating, but it is not that clear on how to react
still, white is stronger in that part of the board (3 stones against 2 to start with) therefore white should be prpared to fight

(;W[pb]LB[lc:A]TR[nc]C[fess: I thought I was being clever with this move, but I don't like the result in this corner.
Would A be better or should I not have extended as far as the triangle?

this is probably your worst move number 1 of the game];B[nd]

A: you were so much afraid of dying that you lost a lot here not so much in points of territory than in overall strength for black and loss of white's natural territory on the left
the game seems lost for white at that stage];W[ic];B[kc]

C[fess: I knew A was needed but seemed like it was turning into another small territory and thought I better take something away from black.
this move do not seem too good to me cause you are starting a new fight when 2 groups aren't totally settled, on the left & at the top but it seems you came out of it ahead thanks to black]
