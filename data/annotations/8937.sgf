mickeyruts [15k\]: hi gg];W[pp]C[This game was my first having handicap against me, and in general I would like to know how to catch up on the initial loss in points. How should W play in handicap games? Thanks for commenting!]
;B[dd]C[I'm not very skilled at handicap games so I can't comment too much a friend of mine once said to play handicap games try to steal their territory and make their groups floating but of course against a strong opponent this will backfire easily]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[pi];B[dj]LB[fc:A]
(;W[cf]LB[ce:A]C[To break up B moyo what are some points to consider?

In this situation A can be quite severe but it might be okay if your opponent is weaker 

Generally with the pincer at D10 this approach is not good because white kicks white cannot extend properly to C10 and C11 is also too close to D10]
(;B[fc]LB[bd:A]C[keima first before jump]
(;W[ef]C[a side note I have seen in high handicap games white approaches a lot without reinforcing]

;B[fq]C[now black is fairly safe];W[hq];B[hr];W[ho]C[Is one space jump too passive, was i able to cut B anymore? 

I would prefer kosumi at G4 as even if black tenuki (see diagram)]
(;B[fm]C[ this point is still very big the loss on the left side is too critical white has very little on the board]
;W[gm];B[fi];W[ci]LB[cj:A]C[Better to make base with this group or run out?

if you want to settle perhaps keima into the corner at B16]
;B[qn]C[I don't understand why black would not block it would kill the two stones and threaten white]

(;W[nq];B[nr];W[mr];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[mm]C[why? black clamps and is connected to the corner]
;B[ml];W[pn]C[Was this too early? Should I have tried to run out with upper left W group? C10 and B16 to settle first

But I don't understand why not R5 or S6?];B[ff];W[cj];B[mi]
C[C6 stones are whites only chance if white can save them maybe white can counter attack but even then the game is very hard for white]
;W[bd];B[gl];W[hm];B[hl];W[ll];B[lm]C[the game is good for black there is no need to complicate things]
(;W[nl]C[Here I was unsure of where to atari, and how to handle situation in general.

Okay important point if you don't know where to atari you can try to reserve the atari and nobi]

this kind of move helps black so you must know why you need to play the exchange]
