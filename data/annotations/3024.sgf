I've added in notes on some of my thinkings during the match.
Thanks in advanced for looking this over
I'm Black in this game

;W[ch];B[dc]LB[fc:A]TR[dd]C[Again, prolly another fuseki mistake, not quite too sure what I should have done here

T: b cuts itself here so d17 stone is quite bad. If you want to attack the marked stone better play at A, since that would serve a double purpose.]
;W[cc];B[ec];W[ce];B[ed];W[cf];B[de];W[cd];B[kc]C[Is this jump too far, or did I just not respond correctly to his invasion?

T: Probably the star point (k16) is better because there is not much to attack on the right side. w doesn't invade correctly but he could easily cut of the marked stone as shown in the variation
Also f15 might be a good option, since you're leaving quite a big weakness in your wall now.]
;W[ic];B[jd]
(;W[he];B[if]C[T];W[ff];B[dg]C[T: no good, better defend the cutting point with f15, since that also attacks the weak w stones]
;W[dh];B[hd];W[gc];B[gd]LB[fe:A]C[T: b puts himself in a lot of danger here! see variation for w's punishment.
b at A probably would have been better since it connects the d14 group and it threatens to cut of w at to sides (g16 and g14)]

(;W[je];B[ie];W[lb];B[hc]C[T: Unnecessary and giving away a lot of points. Move at l18 secures b's top]

;W[cg];B[fg]C[For some reason I diddn't see that whites response here would put me into atari =(
T: you're move seems the best way to defend w e15];W[ef];B[ee]
;W[eh];B[ke];W[ck]C[T: I think that even through all b's mistakes, this last sequence ended up quite well for b]
;B[cm]LB[rd:A][jk:B][fo:C][jo:D]TR[fq][iq]C[T: always intuative to "answer", but let's look at the whole board;
although you're move is quite big, it;s gote, while there are still some very big sente moves on the board.

A is huge, as mentioned earlier, 
B is obviously very important now. b's influence in lower right is very big and a move at B might actually end up in some good territory, 
C & D both serve a double purpose, attacking the marked stones while enlangening b's territory]
;W[bl];B[gh]C[T: far too small considering, the big points just mentioned]
;W[fj];B[hj]C[T: better approach the centre from the lower right, since there's much more potential there, w doesn't really have to answer this.]

;W[cr];B[br];W[bn];B[cn];W[bm];B[eo];W[go]
(;B[gl]TR[rd][mh][jn]C[T: wrong move; the group seems safe enough; creating a double eye or connecting are miai

Let's look more detailed at the whole board again, 

w has about 55 points of territory on the sides, while b has about 30 pts of side. But b has a lot of influence in the centre. If b plays correctly here he could easily create some huge territory  around n8.

I would definitly favour b in this position.

Unfortunatly, b doesn't use the potential, and in the end it's w that ends up with some territory in the centre. Considering this positions this should never have happened.

I will point out some mistakes but the main mistake is a more general on: preferring small moves (such as k14) to huge ones, (like the marked points in this position.

I've given a sample variation sequence...];W[fl];B[fm];W[gm]
;B[fn];W[hl]C[T: b lower right is safe now. No need to rescue g8 stone.]
;B[gk];W[fk];B[hm];W[hk];B[gn];W[gj];B[gm];W[jh];B[ik];W[jo]
;B[il]LB[mg:A]C[T: both last moves are to single purposed, you'r letting w invade you're big territory. Look at A end see how big b's area could have been]
;W[mh];B[jf]C[T: this move by b, combined with the quite useless seqence that set up, the j8 wall, is very bad for b; it now seems that b is not gonna make any territory in the middle, however if b manages to make his right side big, he still has a chance]
;W[oh];B[kh]C[T: of course b is too late now, this sequence leads to a couple of points for b, in return for a lot of strength for w.]
;W[ki];B[ji];W[kg];B[lh];W[li];B[jg];W[lg];B[ih];W[kl]C[T: ouch, well done w, all b's influence vanished!]
;B[ok]LB[ml:A]TR[pi][ql]C[T: no good. the marked stones are already connected. playing at A to gain  territory]
;W[on];B[nn]LB[mm:A]C[T: a common mistake by b; (an also very common at you're rank)
touching you're opponents stones is RARELY the best way to attack! you're just making it easier for w cause he can attack you.

w has no way of making these stones live so all you need to do is try to cut his stones of.  try A instead]

;W[mk];B[qc]TR[qf][qg]C[I'm not sure about the quality of this move. what might be a better option in this corner?
T: as mentioned earlier, s16 is much better. especially since b marked stones are weak; this way, b gets the corner but the marked stones are doomed]

T: as mentioned the biggest mistake is not seeing you;re influence in the centre area. Until move 65 b clearly ahead, and I still favour b up to move 93.
After that b definitly should have collected an easy win, with some big moves but unfortunatly ruined it by playing a series of very small ones :(
Good luck! and any more questions are welcome?])
