;B[pc]C[I think generally white played ok during the fuseki.  Black made some large territorial frameworks which white failed to invade.  A lack of fighting spirit is how I would describe the play of white.]
;W[pp];B[ec];W[cp];B[cf]C[Black's shape seems a little unorthodox in the top left corner.  Black is claiming a large corner.  White should look for an opportunity to invade if possible.]
;W[qe];B[nd];W[jc]C[Mabye q12 or so would have been better? I wanted to split while it was still possible.]

(;W[ig]C[I think at this point the situation was not THAT bad - I had a stable group on top splitting his groups and have an advantage in two corners.]

(;W[ck]C[I don't think it is good to ignore the c3 attachment.]
;B[bp];W[co];B[bq]C[Black's shape is a little lose around d3 which can be exploited later.]

(;B[qn]C[Was it possible to split again, q10?

It's possible, but you may want to solidify the top right white group first by attacking the o16 group.  See Variation.]

;W[rh];B[ph];W[qf];B[ri];W[rg];B[kq]C[The white group on the bottom right is not in any great danger here.  There is S3, M3, and running out to the center/making contact at Q6.]

(;W[rq];B[hp]C[Black is claiming a lot of territory in the bottom left.  Although not impossible to invade, h4 makes it harder.  Perhaps a stronger player could invade, but I prefer some invasion at move 42.]

I don't think you can kill the black group.];B[nc];W[pb];B[qb]

;B[lm];W[tt]C[I have about 25 points, he has three corners and is strong in the center so I resigned. Too early?

Result: B+Resign

Personally, I'd at least use this as an opportunity to practice invading Black's larger territories in the top and bottom left.]
