C[sys: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.
Kyl: hello

Thank you for the review. I have black in this game. I really thought I had a easy victory by the end of the opening (as you will see), but somehow I turned it into a big loss. I have some idea what went wrong, but I would still like to look at the problem with more certainty.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[kq];B[jp]C[...was trying to attack. apparently not a good idea. How should I respond to L3?

I think J3 would be conventional.   K4 definitely looks odd
to me.];W[jq];B[ip];W[kp];B[jn]C[This is a mistake.  Black doesn't need to
escape up, and this isn't making useful
influence.  At the same time, the bottom
is wide open for white to take.];W[nq];B[po];W[hr]C[Good for white.  Black's bottom group
is just floating uselessly.];B[cq]C[
This is a poor choice.   You can't
connect underneath, and even if you
survive in the corner, white will gain
influence toward the middle, which
will make things difficult for your
floating side stones.

At this point, if this corner is the be
the target, D5 or D4 is good.  You
want to emerge with a strong wall
between the corner and the center.];W[fr];B[dq]C[This doesn't connect to the other black
stones, so I think it's a mistake.   B5 or C4
look better to me.];W[ep];B[bo];W[hp];B[ho];W[hq];B[fn]C[
This can't be good - there are too many
cutting points for these stones to be considered
connected.];W[go];B[fo];W[io];B[hn];W[jo];B[in];W[ko]C[Going for outside influence.]
;B[dr]C[this doesn't accomplish anything.  It could
have been a Ko threat at some point, but
all it does here is change a probably bad
black shape into a certainly bad one.];W[er];B[cf]C[should I close at D6 before kakari? but I know White would make a big extension.

I think this is the wrong side to approach.  It invites a splitting move at d10 which will erase the center influence of black's stones on the bottom.

C4 is a very bad point for black if white gets it.];W[dn];B[bd]
;W[cc];B[di];W[ck];B[cm]C[F5 is already weak, you are extending
from a weak point, which makes it weaker.
You should attack from a strong point, not a weak one.   D9, for instance,  puts pressure on C9
and threatens to start working with the black
groups at the bottom.];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl];B[dk];W[ci];B[bk]C[Why not C10 here?]
;W[cj];B[dj];W[ch];B[dh];W[cg];B[df];W[dg];B[ff]C[If youre going to try to capture the white stones,
your only hope is to continue at e13.

But consider that the black side is very
weak, not in a good position to attack
anyway.];W[eg];B[ef];W[fg];B[ec]C[Black really can't do this now.  If white
is permitted to capture the black stones in the center, black has nothing left.]

;W[eh]C[My goal was to build a big moyo (and I did).

You've got about half a moyo, but it's still
open on2 1/2 sides and is unliley to be preserved.];B[pj]C[is Q10 a good point in this situation? or should I do a shimari near Q16?

At this point, I thought I won the game...

You were delusional.   There
are at least 5 open areas in addition
to the big center, White should be able to
make territory in at least 2, and in the process
ruin the center.   The only secure area
black has is the lower right.  Everything
else is open.];W[nd];B[pc];W[qf];B[of];W[rd];B[qe];W[re];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[oh];W[rn];B[rp];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[qi];B[qj]
;W[rj];B[lm]C[still focusing on the moyo.


The center is still open at at least 2 points,
and you do not have sente.];W[kd];B[ib];W[mf];B[mh];W[ob];B[pb]

m12 would have been better];W[lh];B[lf];W[mg];B[me];W[ne];B[le]
;W[nf]C[
You should have been able to read this
sequence and see that white connects
and is oozing into your center.  Since you
could see it,  and it is not favorable, you 
shouldn't have done it.];B[ph];W[kh];B[mj];W[md];B[nc];W[jd]
;B[if];W[nh];B[mi];W[ni];B[nj];W[kj];B[ij]C[I thought I had white for sure...]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[ih];B[jj];W[kk]C[maybe I should have connected at H12.]

;W[ig];B[ie]C[this was a mistake. white K14 and I am dead...]
;W[id]C[but he didn't see it.];B[jf]C[and I had to connect.]

;B[mo];W[mq];B[pr];W[or]C[end game now... whihc i am not good at.

I lost the game by about 40-50 points. I only had small areas in the middle.

My question is how can I best utilize the moyo I had in the beginning to win a won game? Clearly my execution was far from satisfactory.

Thank you for your input. You have my appreciations.

You never had a moyo, you had some influence toward the center, but at huge cost.   I think
the only way a "big center" strategy can be successful is if your opponent is not paying attention.   It should not be your strategy going in.]

;B[rq]C[
Generally, you need to consider that weak
points will eventually be attacked, and that
widely separated stones are not connected
to make a territory, even if there are no white
stones in the area.

It's very hard to make territory in the center,
and that shoud not be your plan from the
beginning.  It can sometimes emerge as
a viable strategy, but it's pretty uncommon.])
