C[MR: You put many questions in the game record at places were you or your opponent played very normal moves. 
On the other hand, you started rather strange fightings at other places of the board, where I got the feeling that you do not really had a plan on what you wanted to achieve. 

My suggestions on what you could do for improvement:

(a) Read a joseki book like "The great joseki debate" that shows you different josekis in a board position and shows you how to evaluate which joseki to choose depending on the surrounding.

(b) Before starting a fight, make a plan what you want to achieve. If it is just "create some complications", only choose the plan if you are clearly behind. If you find out that you wanted to cut apart living groups of your opponent, better make a new plan. If you can't make up a good plan, play a large move.]

(;W[qf]C[Only 2 games on gobase.org go this route, so I suspect that this move is suboptimal

MR: I think that both, R14 and a Kakari in the lower right corner, are fine.
Most players wouldn't like to allow a black shimari in the lower right corner and therefore start with a kakari there.]

(;B[nc]C[neither of them respond this way. It looks weird to me but I can't figure out how to take advantage of it.

MR: The result that you get on the right side is fine - white gets a totally stable position within black's sphere of influence. However, black does not need to answer S18 with R17, so S18 gives black another chance to play a pincer at R12 or R13.]

(;W[jq]C[I felt it would be too good for black if black plays in this area

MR: Yes, playing on the lower edge feels totally normal for white. Variations tend to be very different depending on whether you choose K3 of L3.]
;B[cn];W[fp];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[db]C[I wasn't sure about this move. It seems too defensive, but everything else on the board looks defenseive to me as well. I considred n4 too here, but it seemed I had an answer to black's play in that area that at least helped me a bit, but black d18 followed by c12 was multiple sente for black. This is a position I found very difficult to evaluate

MR: D18 looks perfectly normal to me, as it secures the white corner group. Next largest move seems to be N3.]

(;W[mf]C[MR: My feeling is that O14 is only good if you can continue with the double hane.]
;B[me]C[I didn't like the way this strengthened black, but felt that it was important to get some control of the center... when I feel like I'm not quite sure how to handle the position, I tend to start a fight and see if I can handle that :)

MR: Strange methodology ... If you want to switch to R7, better do not exchange O/N14 against O/N15. If you want to start a fight, better play the double hane or invade the upper side directly.]
;W[qm]C[This was an invitation to invade... making may wall useful...]
;B[qk]C[MR: There is no necessity for black to invade here.]
;W[om];B[ok];W[mm];B[mk]
(;W[np]C[Reduce, and create a potential exit for my stones before attacking

MR: White should keep jumping to separate the black stones. After that, white can play more severe moves against the black lower right formation, e.g. starting with O3 or Q2. White O4 just asks black to stabilize himself.]
