C[Hello, I'm Cooper Mayne (4 Dan)

you played well. many good moves, but i'll only talk about the bad ones. :)

general observations... you cannot play a slack move because you can't read out the complex variations for what you know is the right move. if you can't read it out you just have to jump into the fray and put your opponent to the test. move 15, 69 and 117 were all examples of this.

also positional judgement - try to keep a count of who is winning by how much. then play a strategy based on that information. this is extremely important to getting into dan level play.

a couple moves to look at in particular

see move 15 - this is an important set of variations that happen a lot. you should study them for sure.

see move 69 - you were right. too slow

see move 122 - that was a critical point in the game. it is important to focus on counting so that you know if you are winning or losing a game. if you are losing by a big margin like 20 you have to look for a creative plan to try to steal the game back. there was still a chance of doing that at 122 but your next moves helped him secure his weak groups so that his lead was unassailable.


I hope this is helpful.

;W[oq];B[mq];W[kq]C[this move confused me, since I don't think it is joseki]

(;B[np]C[I was wondering about P 4 aswell, but I didn't choose it, because it would've allowed white to connect easily.

this kosumi is ok i would have played P4 because it is much simpler and the result is good for black]
;W[op]
(;B[no]C[I didn't know if I should've played the hane, but I couldn't read that far, as to know, whether it'd be a good choice or not, so I'd played nobi here instead.

if you are playing kosumi have to hane. if you don't want to hane then don't play kosumi just play at P4 to begin with.

this move is too slow. you can start to attack white with J6 now. white wont have time to kill you. only make a move like O10 as a kind of last resort.]

[mk][kl][ll][km][kn][jo][jp][kq][kr]C[Instead of this move, I also thought about F 3, to negate some of white's thickness, but then I didn't play it, because I thought white couldn't make use of the thickness right away. Don't know if that is correct, though.

this is a good move
but note that white is not really thick. If you pull out the A stone. suddenly white's wall turns into 2 weak groups]

[gj][mj][mk][kl][ll][km][kn]C[you lost way too much. you had the first move on the side and somehow white got 17 points! see variation.

i would say even if you can't do the reading perfectly you just have to dive in to certain fights. no matter what you can't give white so much.

ok this is a keep moment in the game - when white gets those 17 points... he takes a big lead. white is up by 20 points. so this is the time for you to come up with an all or nothing strategy to take him down.

I would say you play A first. then B to attack white group on the bottom. once white runs or lives on the bottom aim for a play at E to attack white marked stones in the center.

small measures cannot help you win this game. you have to do something drastic.]
