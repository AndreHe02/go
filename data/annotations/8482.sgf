C[Hello, dear reviewer!

This is Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL and in other go places.

In this game I had to invade a large moyo and the fighting went confusing. Most of the time I did not know if I was reading or just guessing.
As a stronger player you will probably find many mistakes and oversights and missed chances, so please help me seeing them and understanding this mess better.

Thank you!

FM: hi, this is Field Mouse again :-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[pj];W[nc];B[ne];W[ld]
(;B[kp]C[Hon: Here my opponent surprised me for the first time.

But I thought, if he is going to built a moyo smaller than recommended, maybe the best would be to just let him have what he wants.

FM: always try not to give your opponent what he wants :)]
(;W[ci];B[kj]SQ[jj][jp]C[Hon: Again he is building tightly.

FM: black looks scared, the normal way is to occupy the star points. This does not mean black is bad, but it can give you some information about our opponents psychology]
(;W[id]TR[nc][ld]C[Hon: I thought, as long as I don't have weak groups, I should be able to contest on points in the end.

FM: The marked stones were not weak, it was better to take the big point in the lower side instead. Black pincering here is exactly what you wanted.]
(;B[gp]C[FM: strange move];W[dn]
(;B[hj]C[Hon: Another non-standard move. It was not so easy for me to judge if they were bad or actually good in another way. For now I decided to regard this move as slow.

FM: this move does not look good as it does not do much and black does not need to strenghten this way.]
(;W[ei]LB[hh:A]C[Hon: I defended where I would have played in black's place.

FM: white is aiming at A with this move, but at the same time black has an opportunity to protect his moyo]
;B[pn]
(;W[eq]LB[qc:C][hh:A][pq:B]C[FM: small, ABC are better points to play.]
;B[hg];W[de]TR[hg]C[Hon: Here again I thought H13 in itself is not doing that much, so if I just strengthen myself here with points, I should be alright.

Of course it has become obvious, that I will have to invade later.

FM: the marked exchange was good for black];B[lf]TR[hg][hj]
C[FM: After the marked stones were played this move is not so big anymore. But black still looks a bit better.]
(;W[qd]C[Hon: Is this the best point?

FM: locally it looks the best you can play, but...];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[pe];W[rc];B[qc];W[rd];B[rf];W[pb]C[Hon: Locally I thought this was okay for me, but he has sente now.]
;B[oq]C[Hon: This was to be expected.

Here I began to feel that maybe I had just waited a bit too long with reduction.

FM: Yes, you let black build his moyo too big. The plan to give black what he wanted did not prove to be good.]
;W[ip]C[Hon: This looked like a logical invasion point, since here he still has some weakness.

From now on the messiness begins.

FM: looks like the only chance to make the game not easy for black]
(;B[iq];W[hq];B[jq];W[hp];B[jn]C[FM: a bit painful result for black, although he still has 100 pts moyo.]
;W[ql]C[Hon: Looks terrible deep, like in a handicap game, but I thought I had some things to work with like moves in the corner, T14, L5 ... still, it is the kind of all-or-nothing games I usually try to avoid.

FM: this looks dirty, trying to trick life where it is not - well why not :)]
(;B[qm]C[FM: this is what white wanted black to answer.];W[rm]
;B[rn];W[qj];B[qi];W[pk]C[FM: and white makes some shape. Maybye it is still possible to capture the white group, but things are getting very complicated.]
;B[rj];W[rk]C[Hon: I thought a ko fight was a good result for me here since black has only one large territory. Every reduction will look like a ko threat.

FM: yes]
(;B[qk];W[pm];B[qn];W[qj];B[pc];W[qb];B[qk];W[ko]
(;B[jo];W[jp];B[lp];W[qj];B[hr]
(;W[pi]C[FM: slightly suboptimal, still the ko is bad for black.]
(;B[qk];W[jm]
(;B[gq];W[qj];B[oj];W[ri];B[qk];W[kn]C[Hon: This looked like my largest threat. I thought my opponent just could not allow me to capture here.

FM: yep, but black cannot allow w to capture at R12];B[qj]C[Hon: Of course he can not allow me to win the ko either, so he connected anyway.]
;W[in]C[Hon: But now my reduction seems to have worked.

Or so I thought, but the real messiness is still going to happen.]
(;B[lm];W[ir];B[fr]C[FM: mistake!]
(;W[lo];B[mp]C[FM: black is happy to protect here];W[mn]
(;B[hm]C[Hon: Here I got something like isolated, and my lower left corner and my left side framework are starting to look thin.

FM: this move does not look super serious, white has much space to operate in and one eye]
;W[jr]C[FM: aji keshi, next time keep the ko possibility];B[kq]
;W[hs];B[gr];W[ll]TR[hm]C[FM: anything white plays here costs black points while the value of the marked stone is not clear.]
;B[mm];W[hn];B[gn];W[gm];B[fm];W[gl];B[hl];W[go];B[fn];W[fo]
;B[fk];W[nm];B[ml];W[on]C[Hon: As a compensation for my thinness on the left side I manage to pull out my other group.

FM: painful for black.];B[ol];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[lk];W[om]
(;B[co]C[Hon: Now we came to a point where a KGS 3d and a KGS 2d contested their guessing skills.]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[fp]
(;B[dr];W[er];B[es];W[cr];B[kr];W[he]C[Hon: I judged that my group in the lower left was alright, so I played here to prevent his next invasion. Maybe he could have already invaded there earlier, but he didn't.

FM: yes. The lower left gote nothing was not good for black.]
;B[en];W[fq];B[do];W[fs]C[Hon: This was big for me I thought, since the left side was thin for me anyway and black can not capture C6 too largely.

FM: ouch];B[ck]
(;W[bk]C[Hon: I just wanted to reduce.];B[bj]C[FM: natural.]
;W[cj];B[bl];W[dk];B[cl];W[dl];B[bi];W[bh];B[ch]C[Hon: But he pulled me into another complex fight and I seem to be in more danger than I was hoping.]
;W[bg]C[Hon: If it was me, I would think about cutting at D 10 now.]
;B[cf];W[cg]
(;B[eg];W[dh]C[Hon: Here I felt like he had let me off the hook.]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[bm]C[Hon: There is even still a way to attack these stones, so I wondered what he had accomplished here at all.

FM: the attack is not so easy as it might look like];B[ak];W[bo]
;B[cp];W[ai];B[dm];W[cm]C[FM: unfortunately this has some complications]
;B[em];W[bp];B[bq];W[cq]C[Hon: But again here I felt like maybe It was all more dangerous for me than I thought, if he plays the atari at A7 and the nobi at B2.

FM: black can make a ko here]
(;B[dj];W[ej];B[ek]
(;W[df]C[Hon: Somehow I must have thought here that the lower left was safe enough. Well ... was it safe, what do you think?

FM: considering the ko in the lower left it looks like the best move was a7. This would be the second best move :)]
;B[fd];W[fc];B[gc]
(;W[gd];B[fb]C[Hon: Here my opponent surprised me. His push and cut here was more ajiful than I had imagined.

FM: yes, this is not good for white];W[ec];B[hc];W[ic];B[ib]
;W[jb];B[hd];W[ge];B[ie];W[gf];B[fg]C[Hon: Now I could not find a way to save my stones.

FM: yes];W[ha];B[gb];W[je];B[if];W[hb];B[gg]C[Hon: At least I kept sente here, but it was a big loss.]
;W[sn];B[so];W[sm];B[rp];W[di];B[bn]C[Hon: This looked like the wrong starting point.

FM: yes, black missed a good chance here. From now engame begins. Thanks for attention :-)]
