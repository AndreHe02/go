AB[dd][pd][dp];W[pp];B[pj];W[fq]LB[dn:A][fp:B][hq:C][cn:D]C[This move wants a response.

In a handicap game as black, your best moves are probably A or B or C.  A is a
little too territory oriented for an even game, and B isn't good in an even
game because of the way it ends up building white (attaches a weak stone).

See variations for details.

In an even game, D is often better than A.]
(;B[jd]C[Don't get me wrong, this is a big point, but it allows white to make a double
kakari on your LL corner.];W[cn]C[Like this.]
(;B[dn]LB[eo:A][fq:B]C[This isn't a bad move, I think, but my teacher likes A far more than this,
because it doesn't attach a weak stone. Note that at this point, the joseki I
sketched earlier is messed up by B.];W[dm];B[eo];W[em];B[eq]
C[This also attaches a weak stone - which sort of asks white to strengthen that
stone.  It's usually (not always) best to avoid attaching a weak stone.]
;W[fo];B[fp];W[gp];B[co];W[bn];B[fr];W[gq];B[cq]C[You've got life now, but white has built a nice wall around you, with lots of
"outward influence".  This influence is close in value to the territory you've
secured.

A goal when white comes after your corner like this: Try to break through
white's wall, to reduce the value of white's influence.];W[en]
;B[po]C[Be careful about attaching to a weak stone.];W[op];B[np]
LB[qc:A][jj:B]C[This is perhaps an overplay.  Besides you have a beautiful framework in the
top and right - it's worthwhile to develop that now.  Don't pick a fight with
white in a handicap game if you can avoid it.

I like A or B instead.];W[oo];B[pn];W[nq]LB[np:A]C[Now A is in trouble.  You could run, but white might just love the chance to
chase you and gain territory while chasing.];B[on];W[qp];B[qo]
;W[mp];B[dj]C[This is good - it nullfies white's wall to some extent, and it makes a nice
extension from the upper left corner.];W[fj]C[White's trying to take the outside again, hoping to build territory in the
center.];B[fi]C[Careful - we're attaching to a weak stone again.]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]LB[de:A]C[Note that A wouldn't have been a bad move - if you keep white on the third
line, the influence you get on the outside is a good trade.  Not so on the
fourth line though.  A has the advantage that it doesn't leave a cutting point.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[fk]LB[ec:A][fj:B]C[Defending at A is a good move.

This attack on B is unlikely to be effective];W[gj];B[gc];W[be]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[md]C[This is good, though it doesn't protect the upper right corner much.  The
upper right is kind of begging for another 3-3 invasion right now.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe]LB[pe:A]C[Save comment as before - This is ok, but A is good too.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[rd]LB[oc:A]C[This is probably overaggressive.  White's almost certainly going to make life
in the corner.  I think the best way to play here is to keep white confined to
the corner in a small area, giving yourself lots of outward influence.  Note
that influence along P and Q in the upper right would combine nicely with the
other stones at the top to build a really big moyo.

I believe A is usual here.];W[nb]LB[oa:A][oc:B]C[This is a "clamp".  White can follow up at A or B.]

(;B[oc];W[oa];B[mb];W[nc];B[nd];W[pe];B[od];W[re];B[mc];W[na]

;W[fl];B[ek]LB[ih:A][lj:B][lm:C]C[This is a small move.  I'd probably play something around A or B (to build
territory directly) or C (to threaten white's developing large moyo and
hopefully indirectly build a large moyo for yourself).  Always think "is this
the biggest move on the board?"

it's good to save one stone if that one stone is connecting two of your weak
groups, or separating two of white's weak groups, but if it's just one lone
stone like this, you're probably best off ignoring it and playing something
bigger.];W[ck];B[cj];W[bj];B[bi];W[bk];B[eg];W[cg];B[dg];W[bh]

[lg:B]C[Good. Ignoring the capture of the smallish stone at A, and threatening to
build a large moyo around B.];W[hj];B[kj]LB[jm:A]C[Really nice.

This creates a nice moyo for you, and threatens to climb into white's moyo
around A.];W[ij];B[jj]LB[ji:A][ih:B][hg:C][gh:D]C[This is a little thin.  It's better to fall back just a little bit at A.

You can recognize that this is thin, because there are two easy ways white can
atari you - first at B, then at either C or D.];W[ih]C[This is why - it gives white a couple of free moves inside your moyo, which
means white gets a free start on an invasion.];B[ji];W[gh];B[hg]
;W[ig];B[gg];W[jf];B[if];W[jg];B[jl]LB[oe:A]C[This is good, but A is good too.  Probably A is even bigger, since it helps
your large moyo, and threatens to crush white's invasion at the same time.]

of killing the triangled group.];W[nh]C[IMO, white recognized the value of that cut, and prevented it at first
opportunity.];B[oj];W[oh];B[ph];W[mi];B[mj];W[li];B[im];W[in]

;W[ro];B[rn];W[rp];B[oi]LB[gr:A]C[I think this is worth only one or two points in gote.

Consider A, which is worth a couple of points in sente - white really needs to
respond.];W[sn]
(;B[sg]LB[sm:A]C[A was an urgent move - really important.  You really shouldn't tenuki (play
elsewhere) when something like this comes up, or white will devastate your
territory by playing B.

Note that you Can sometimes tenuki in a situation like this, but only to play a
larger threat.  Your move at T13 isn't worth anywhere near as much as white's
followup at A.];W[rf]LB[sm:A]C[White's response was inappropriate, I believe.  A is huge for black, for this
stage of the game];B[sf]LB[rm:A][gr:B]C[A is still much more important.

Also, this is a gote move - even if you don't play A, B is a sente move.]
