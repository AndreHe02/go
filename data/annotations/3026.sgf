C[I won this game by the slimmest of margins and felt quite fortunate to do so. I will appreciate comments on any aspect of the game.

Both sides play well in this game. Most of my comments are made during the first pass through the game and point out things that seem to be apparent to you given the subsequent course of the game. Thus your strategy and movement placement are for the most part as good as I might have done in similar circumstances. There are, however, 2 life and death situations that could have given you a comfortable lead, if you had seen them. I am just a little unsure about the one in the lower right, but it seems that you could have had this corner.

Good luck in your future play.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]

C[THis seemed a rather weak move to me.

It seems relatively small and gote, but b probably feels that he needs to shore up this group before it becomes too heavy or he needs to sacrifice it. Maybe it is not as gote as it seems because your next move seems like a response. I am not really sure how weak or strong this move is. A or B are alternatives to consider or maybe b should just step back and strenghten his own side.]
;W[cd];B[ei];W[dq];B[dk];W[ck]C[
I can't say for sure who is ahead, but the game is an asymmetrical contest between a larger more open b influence and 2 relatively solid pieces of w territory. b's stones on the left are now playing a valuable role in flattening and reducing w's territory. w is going to need to invade to do the same to b.]
;B[el];W[en];B[go]C[
In this exchange w tries to come out into the center with his solid group, provoking b to try to hem him in while solidifying his own position.]
;W[nq]C[Should I have approached at O17, R14 or R6 instead?

I ask myself these kind of questions all the time. I would probably be tempted to play O17 first because it is an extension as well as an approach, but you are still going to have to invade b's moyo so maybe it is best to do it right away. If you end up with sente after the invasion, N17 might be better since it is a tighter extension.]
;B[pn];W[kq];B[jq];W[kp]C[
I like Q2 here because b might feel that he should respond to it.]
;B[mc]C[
b gets the big point.];W[qq];B[pq];W[pr];B[qp];W[qr];B[bi];W[ef]
;B[gh]LB[qh:A][qf:B][kn:C][nn:D]C[
Again I am not sure who is ahead in an absolute sense but I would play b's side if I had a choice. I like the central influence that he has. In order to defeat it, you probably need to do 2 things: Invade again to reduce his still loose moyo, maybe at A or B and get sente to move into the center with your group at the bottom at something like C or D.]
;W[kn]C[
I might have invaded first, but lets see what happens.];B[mo]
;W[nn];B[no];W[mn];B[oo];W[lo];B[mj];W[qg]C[
I am not sure that this is the wrong point, but it seems odd to me. Lets see what happens again.]
;B[of]C[
This seems like an odd move too. I would have played for territory on one side or the other of the invading stone. b gets sente in the end so his play has at least some merit.]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[ri];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb];B[pe]
(;W[qe]C[
You have to be a little unhappy with the way b is forcing you to make life while taking sente and central inflence, so I tried an alternate line here that i think is a little better.]
;B[mq];W[mr];B[nr]
(;W[mp]C[
I think that this move is the problem. The situation is one where b is throwing in sacrifice stones to try to get something. Your move is trying to keep him from getting anything at all, but his cross-cut tesuji is too severe for that. You must accept a lower position.]
;B[oq];W[lq];B[or]C[My corner is snatched away. How could I have played this little battle more effectively?

See earlier comment and alternate from move 77.];W[np];B[le]
;W[jh]C[I was worried about too much Black influence in the centre.

Good thought. This point is a little far from any of your groups, but it can run either up or down so lets see what happens.

Well this stone gets captured, but I am not sure that its placement could really be better. It would nice to lay a foundation for this move by making some forcing moves on the top or bottom, but I don't really see how to do it with any confidence in the desired result.]

(;W[qf]LB[pf:A][rf:B]C[
This is not really needed I think and if it was, it might be better played at A or B, leaving potential eyespace here. Meanwhile your lower right might still have life. (See alternate)]

b captures the original triangle reducing stone and grabs some territory from the center that you hoped he wouldn't.]

;W[cg]LB[be:A][bd:B]C[
I don't think you should have played the move at A unless you were prepared to play at B after b responded. If you play at B your position is secure and b knows that he needs to make life for his group. In the game line, you make threats on all sides, but they are empty.]
