C[Hello, and first, thanks for reviewing my game.  I played white in this game.  In this game, the main feature of the middle game was an attack on a black group.  My main problem is I am not sure how to attack this group so as to profit from it.  I didn't expect to kill it (although it might have been possible), but I didn't seem to be able to profit from the attack very well. I also have a few questions about earlier play.  Of course, any other comments would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Azack, 

You had an opponent similiar to the ones I hate most to play against. They play unreasonable moves and also I am always struggling to win.

Although you were behind almost the whole game you did have have 3 changes (52. 114 & 176) to get into the game again.

The first major mistake was move 26 and this caused you to be behind the rest of the game.

How to improve your play ? 
- When you have determined a strategy, try to stick to this (move 20). 
- do not get upset when opponent plays unreasonable moves, avoid to play at an impuls. Count to 10 first and then start thinking of the best of move on the board.
- do not get too attached to your own (potential) territory (move 26). With moves like black played (move 25) you normally you get compensated on another part of the board by influence or territory.]

[nq:C][ed:D]C[I wasn't sure whether this or the enclosure at A was better.

This is possible, when black B, white can play A or C.
Probably E is slightly better since white has a perfect extension to F.

When white A black will play D. This is also playable.];B[ed]

(;W[gc]LB[ec:A][df:B]C[Is it better to play a pincer or something like A or B?

Depends on what you want, play A for territory however I would not recommend it now. See alternatives.]
;B[fe];W[dc]LB[cg:A]C[I do not like this move. Prefer to play at A to keep the left open.]

(;B[dj]LB[cf:A]C[This move does not seal off the left side. 

Probably better to play A.];W[qf];B[nc];W[pj];B[oq]
(;W[mq]LB[qh:B][pj:A]C[This pincer seems natural.

I do not like this move, the area where whit has to make territory is on the left, not on the bottom half of the board.
Also you played A so your intension was to get territory on the left, stick to this idea. Strengthen the left side will also make an invasion of black at B harder for him.]
;B[oo]C[This moves destroys whites changes to a moyo on the left.]
;W[qn];B[om];W[pl];B[qh]LB[be:D][jo:C][cf:B][hq:A]TR[qf]C[This seems a little unreasonable to me, but is might be possible due to the weakness of the marked stone.  Still, this position seems perfect for a splitting attack.  I don't really know the right way to execute it, though.  This is when the game started to go bad, it feels.

Well there is a lot of aji on the left so black can play here.
However this move comes too soon,  A is much better, it makes territory, attackes the white group and by doing so strengthens the 3 black stones. 
When white answers with C, black B or D and white has a very tough game.]

(;W[qi]LB[pg:A]C[This move is too one sighted it is only aimed at protecting your territory on the left.
Playing A will give you a splitting attack on 2 groups.];B[ph]
;W[of];B[pi];W[qj];B[nh]
(;W[nj]C[This should probably be at 33.

There is no way for white to attack the black group.
I think you made the best choice to give a way the 2 white stones.]
;B[mf]C[Black does not have a weak group now.];W[qc]LB[qd:A]
C[It seems pointless to try to escape.
Should this be left for later?  I did finish in gote.

This is a big move, if black plays here or at A, this corner is at least 35 points of territory. This is more then white gained on the left site.

So timing is okay, I think the problem lies with move 26.];B[qd]
;W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[rf];W[ob];B[nb];W[pb];B[ic];W[hd]LB[fb:A]
C[Probably better one space above this.

You need to break out, although it is painfull black can play A.]
;B[fb];W[fc];B[gb]
(;W[hc]LB[ge:A]C[I do not like this move, if black plays 38 you can always defend the cut with A]
;B[hb];W[id];B[jc]
(;W[pr]C[What is the right way to attack here?  I had intended to chase the black stones to the left, to take territory on the bottom and become able to reduce or invade the left.  As you'll see, it didn't quite work.

Another possibility is A. For black to slide into the corner does not really help him so he has to get out.]
;B[mo]C[This is a good nove, white has no real possibilities to attack black.]
;W[lp]C[This looks bad now, but what would be better?];B[kn]
;W[io];B[gq]LB[im:A]C[I had hoped to play in this area first.  Now, black has left his group weak in the center, but again, I don't know how to attack it properly.

Game has become difficult for white. White has app. 40 points of territory, black has at least 40 and a moyo on the leaft side that might give him another 30 points. 
A is probably the best move, it attacks black and makes an invasion on the left more feasable.]
;W[im];B[kl];W[kj]C[The idea here is to drive black to the left, so I can destroy his framework.]
;B[be]LB[mm:A]C[Again, black leaves himself weak, but what to do?

Kill the black stones, 61 is unreasonable, black should get out.
How to kill is difficult. Maybe a move at A first is better.]

(;W[lm]C[Black is alive, so no use to play her . This moves costs you 5 points. Better Q6.]
;B[pn];W[df]C[I feel like I'm behind now, so I tried something drastic.  Is there a better place to play?

This fight, like the last one, I have no useful comments on. If you see any glaring or small mistakes, feel free to comment.

Well let's count to see if you are behind:
White:
Top left:   6 points
Top right:  6 points
Left side:  18 points
Centre and bottom: 5 points
So in total: 35 points
Black:
Top:  26 points
Centre:   10 points
left corner: 26 points
Total:  62 points

So you must kill a large group of black.The 5 black stones are the only possibility.]

You lost the game earlier but prior to this move you had a change to get back into the game again.
