C[dmg> Hi, I am Damien, I'm 14k FR and I am playing black here. It was quite a fast game but I took enough time (we have like 40sec byo youmi). Currently It seems like i just lost my games on careless mistakes. I am not really interested on the commentary of that mistake (which is obvious) but more on general tips like what big points I have missed and which shapes problem I have.

jk: Hi, I'm Joona, 5 kyu, from Finland. You didn't have a lot of questions here so I've just written some of ideas I got.

This was a good game to get reviewed, but also a bit difficult one. I've written some kind of a conclusion in the end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]C[dmg> It seems like I always do this opening when I am black. I've tried a few different thing recently but I still play the komoku and the hoshi together a lot.

jk: So do I :-).];W[dd];B[qn];W[jp]
(;B[jd]C[jk: This move looks awkward, should be somewhere on the third line. You started out territorially in the lower right corner whereas this move seems to aim at influence. However, a kyu player probably won't lose because of such an early move.]
;W[qi]
(;B[qk]C[dmg> Is that the good direction ?

jk: In my opinion, no. You are extending from a tight position (lower corner). Your stones are low here, so they're not making a lot of territory. I believe this made it a bit hard to reduce white's moyo later.]
;W[qf]
(;B[oe]C[I did not knew what to do here. The kosumi is ok ?

jk: It's not a very severe attack. White can settle himself easily. Also, White has a star-point stone in the left corner so you can't hope to make a very big moyo here.]

(;B[cj]C[a premiere also for me to do that.

jk: I don't recommend it. White is building a moyo so you shouldn't touch and strenghten it. I think this is the turning point of the game with the corner invasion.]
;W[ck];B[ci];W[di];B[ch];W[dh]C[jk: White gets central territory, you get next to nothing.]

jk: Hard to say, A looks a bit better. Also, white's moyo isn't fully completed but there's a gap you can try to exploit. Generally, making third line territory is small compared to doing something about a moyo.]

[ss]C[dmg> Then I've lost my game by 7.5 with a 0.5pt komi. I've lost around 20pt in the ko fight.

jk: 20pt is probably exaggerating, because sacrificing and living(shown in a variation) would have lead to a loss anyway.

jk: I think that in this game, you should have reduced white's moyo more lightly instead of invading. After your invasions, it was a bit hard to reduce lightly. Generally, I think you played pretty well.

It's my style to be very cautious with such moyos so I prefer reducing early. Maybe in future you should start to always keep an eye on if your opponent can make a moyo and see if an invasion or a reducing move is better. It seems like your style is territorial so reducing techniques are something you have to learn.

On the other hand, it may be so that you lost just because you wanted to try out c10. Though it's not always a bad move, I hope that this game showed you a warning about what such a move can lead to.
