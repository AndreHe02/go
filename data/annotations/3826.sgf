AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Ash [21k?\]: hello from derby
Giving away 3 stones!];W[dd]C[nikko1976 [24k?\]: from france]
;B[cf]C[all of the following stones are better for your needs]

(;W[fd]LB[gc:A][gd:B]C[too small A or B is better];B[ci];W[pj]
LB[qj:A]C[with aim of forming an extension

Dont go here yet and if you do A is better.  You still want to get into a corner area.  You are behind and letting black get stronger by not taking the offensive.  White need to be more aggressive when there is handi like this.]
;B[nc];W[jc]C[look for moves on ranks 3&4, extending from the corner

Your theory is right on but this stone is not needed yet. You still need to go to another corner.  Black at O17 is not a threat to you and allows you to move on somewhere else!]
;B[jq]C[See all options]
(;W[qf]C[staking a claim to side territory];B[qe];W[pf];B[pe]
CR[cn][qn][cq][fq][oq]C[White Q14 was good... black Q15 was very unnecessary, opportunity for White to strike!

Any of these areas are a good next stone for white
I would like to see the bottom right corner personally attacked soon!]
;W[qn]C[and now extending other side as well. despite giving 3 stones start i was not panicking yet

I would panic!  Black just needs another stone in the bottom right and white will really be losing ground!]
;B[qo];W[pn]C[Good stone but youre playing slow.];B[po]C[Another opportunity now for white with this black stone.]
;W[lc]CR[cn][nn][co][cq][fq][iq][kq]C[Just not a needed move here, better at any circle mark.]
;B[cc]C[i had wondered whether to play here myself previous move but thought that exchange of corner space for a good outer wall was a fair exchange

This would be unnecessary for white so that is good that you did not go there.  Now that black has gone there you would want to play D17 and secure your top territory and let black have this side.  You have more to worry about right now .  If you had played there before black I would suggest C16.]
;W[cd]C[chose this side ( as opposed to D17) to stop his connection.. but in hindsight perhaps better to have played D17 as it might have worked better with my stones at F16

Your hindsight is correct 20/20];B[dc];W[ec];B[bd];W[be];B[bc]
;W[db];B[ab];W[cb]C[i conciously sacrificed b15


Yes good];B[ce];W[ba];B[bf];W[cn]C[again looking for either an extension or pincer attack at F3 or even play c3

Im glad to see your stone in here!

Try to be aware of your opponent earlier and throw the stone in there and take Sente from them make them respond to your good stones]
;B[co];W[ck]C[the standard extension...,which i CANNOT PLAY AND MUST LEARN!!!!

This is fine!!!!]
(;B[bj];W[bk];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[dm];B[dn];W[cm];B[fn];W[cj]
;B[bi]
(;W[ei]CR[ej][fk]SQ[fj]C[i was beginning to think about a moyo M17/ K17 / F16 E11 with aim of using a q10 extension also

Ok, I see this.. the correct extension here is shown with circle marks.

I dont quite know that the square is too far or not.  I am generally conservative.  I try to not fight too much.  But I am a reletively strong fighter from a ton of practice and reading.]

(;B[dh]
(;W[di];B[cg];W[eh];B[jm]C[This is huge!

Still vulnerable but big territory!];W[jj]C[i could see my moyo taking shape

I see black with a huge lower territory!]
(;B[gk];W[gj]CR[gi]C[better connection]
(;B[hk];W[hj];B[ek];W[ej];B[fk]C[you can let black in; in exchange for a sente move somewhere else]

(;W[fj];B[ml];W[mj]C[at this stage i felt OK.. but was conscious of B territory up to 5th rank

Black is so big and you are getting scared I think.]
(;B[nk]
(;W[nj]C[was happy to build this wall but recognized that had to penetrate lower half as i am probably behind by ~35]
;B[ne];W[le]C[Black was good move here.  You responded well!]
;B[ng];W[ph]C[filling a weak point and protecting the side

Good];B[pl];W[ql];B[pm];W[qm];B[lg];W[kg];B[li];W[ki]C[My moyo now in place but needs a plug at e14. I have some space on RHS

E14 not a concern right now... you need to figure you strategy on the bottom and leave the territory alone on top... this is a game of give and take, you are giving more than taking... its ok to give but you are allowed to take!]
;B[lh];W[kh];B[lf];W[kf];B[me];W[ld]C[i felt that this sequence was to W advantage

W had no choice];B[qc]C[this was very bad move for Black

Yet again another opportunity for white!!!!!

SEE variations!]
(;W[ef]C[NO];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fe];B[eg];W[fg];B[dg];W[lq]
C[I am behind so need to invade. Question..if I had done this properly, and the similar fatal exercise at mve 131, would it have swung the game?  Or was W too far behind anyway?  At this stage i thought B led by ~60

Yes Black is way ahead.  This is a last ditch effort for white and still the wrong stone]

(;B[lp];W[oq]C[i thought i should be ablre to live in this situation..and failed badly. I repeated the errors a little later around F3, i think that these combination of poor play by me cost the game]

If you let something go and place a stone elsewhere and ignore your opponent, they may place an additional stone where you ignored them but often times it's because they think they are gaining more than you.  Learn to place a stone where they should respond then make them pay for not responding!!!!  Watch the mid to upper kyu players 13k-5k  You will see alot of mistakes and also learn alot.]
