C[kumakichi: Hi!
alewis: hi

To the reviewer: I'm playing Black in this game. Many of my wins are the result of tesujis resulting in significant captures. This game is different, in that it finally came down to a loss by a narrow margin. I feel I made several mistakes throughout the game that left me in a poor position, so I'm interested not only in the specific tactical errors I made, for some of which that I think I have recognised I've inserted comments, but also in what improvements I could make to my strategic game.

Thanks.

ALewis - Good game; it showed good fighting spirit on your part. But sometimes we don't need to fight to win :) It's important to pick our fights carefully, as you'll see.]

;B[lq];W[lo];B[ko];W[kn];B[jo];W[gq]C[I think I handled the response to this move poorly, allowing White to build influence in the lower left corner. This led to problems later.

- There was no way for you to avoid strengthening the lower left corner. This is the nature of trying to reinforce a group that's already sitting against a strong group at P3. What happens is that B must play moves to reinforce, while W only needs to attack from one side, in the process making territory in the LL. That's why the alternate line provided looks more appealing to me.]

;B[nj];W[jl];B[ho];W[gn];B[hn]C[After this sequence, both of you played unnecessary forcing moves. W played a bunch of moves along N7-N9, helping you solidify your right side for free (and fixing your cutting points in the process).

On the other hand, you also played your fair share of unnecessary moves at H5 and H6, helping W solidify his left side. Better for you to jump out and run, hoping to find life in the center, and leave the LL corner more porous and open to invasion later on.]

(;W[jd];B[cj];W[ch];B[cm];W[do]C[Now the lower left corner looks large. Counting it later, it is really only about 25 points, suggesting the slide to B5 and 1-point jump to E7 are enough to keep it in check. Perhaps I should be looking at someing like J15 or D15 instead?

You're right, LL is not that big (that's because you played a wedge at C10). On the other hand, W has a moyo going in the top left corner, which i pretty big. You should stabilize the left group ASAP without making unecessary moves, and then invade the top left.]

yeah, this move doesn't work at all, but since both of you played the same number of moves in W's territory, you actually didn't lose anything except a bunch of ko threats (ignoring the last move, which, as you said, was wasted)]

You were ahead for most of the game; your strategical mistakes were in being too greedy at the top left, choosing to counterpincer at beginning. Your tactical mistakes were in leaving really bad shape at top right/ enabling W to do a harsh 3-3 invasion, messy center endgame, bad shape at bottom right. 

W's tactical mistakes were in handling the ko at LL, handling the attack at UL, needlessly pushing up the middle and giving you territory on the right.  

I know you asked for analysis on your side, but it's important for both sides, so that you know when to tenuki, when to attempt to exploit bad shape, and when to play more safely.]
