AB[dp][pd]C[I had some pretty big wins against this player (with 0 komi) so, I decided to give him 2 stones, which was a little bit to much.
Thank you in advance for reviewing this game.];W[pp]C[(DrK:

Dear thenr42,

I am DrK and I will be your reviewer for this game. This is my 3rd review and I am still learning how to do it well so please do not hesitate to contact me at drk.derek@gmail.com if anything here is confusing or if you have further questions.

All comments are in brackets ().

This is a handicap game and from your comments I will focus mainly on you playing as white and on specific mistakes black made that white can punish. I will also conclude with 3 main things you can work on in your next handicap game.

Also, generally, my 7k approach to playing white in handicap games are as followed:

a. Seize corner without being boxed in. Run to the centre is quite okay (and very likely);
b. Be prepared to be pincered and know how to respond (although I am still learning too it is a difficult subject as much as you can);
c. As with normal game, play the move that is of most value on the board. Don't rashly react to opponent's move but objectively evaluate the board and fine the best move you can see.
d. Keep most black groups on the board unsettled (not yet have 2 eyes) as long as possible. It is difficult to force black or seize advantage unless opponent has group you can threaten;
e. Try to keep your groups difficult to be killed (by having 2 eyes, by connected to other groups, or by threatening bigger points of the opponent);
f. Connect your groups as much as possible and disconnect opponent groups as much as possible.
g. Initiative is even more valauble in handicap games than normal. Keep it in mind.

Enjoy!

Cheers

-DrK)];B[cd];W[fp]MA[dn]TR[fq]C[Too agressive?

(DrK: No. I think this move is fine because:

a. the stone is supported by the presence of your white stone at Q4. For example, this move is definitely better than if you play at X.
b. In order to catch up to black white needs to be aggressive, as long as there is no glaring weakness.
c. F4 has indirect influence on top left and top right (support) and top right (potential ladder breaker).

However, I would consider F3 (triangle) to be better because it balances better with Q4 (one is on 4th line the other on 3rd line) but this is a minor quibble from me. The important thing is you have the right idea.)]
;B[nq]C[(DrK: This move is questionable by black. Instead of taking advantage of his extra stones black invade white's area. Naturally white should pincer.)]

(;W[qn]C[(DrK:

This move is playable although I would consider it a bit mild. White plays safely. However I would pincer in order to:

a. Help F4 group to gain a safe base.
b. Make black stone O3 run to the centre.

See variation)];B[pr];W[qq];B[qg]C[(DrK: Black's group at bottom right does not have a good base yet. R13 is premature. White can punish by pincer.)]

(;W[pj]MA[qk]C[(DrK: This move isn't bad, but I would not play it personally because:

a. It did not take advantage of black's mistake of not making a base for black's group at bottom right;
b. It does not completely give white's group space to form 2 eyes (as opposed to if you play at X);
c. It does not really form a good area of space (black can slide in at say S10);)]
;B[no]C[(DrK: (Palms up) Black still didn't form a base. Enough said...)]

(;W[on]MA[oh][nm]C[I didn't want black to completely encrouch me. Perhaps K4 or E16 might have been better?

(DrK: I will examine each of the moves you suggested. However, the key issue in the board at the moment is:

a. F4 white stone is without a base;
b. O3 black groups is not yet with a base;

So I consider moves that 1. gain white group a base and; 2. while depriving black group safe base as most urgent.

Move P6 in here does not achieve objective 1 or 2 so I would play somewhere else.

I also note that in order for white group at bottom right to be encircled, black needs to play at least 2 moves. So it is relatively less urgent.)]
;B[nn];W[ed]MA[jp][jq][kq]C[(DrK: You seem to prefer kakari at 4th line. I note that 3rd line is usually to gain a base and 4th line is usually to be support or gain influence in the centre. Generally it is good to vary and balance with some at 3rd line and some at 4th line.

However, I reiterate that even now white should play somewhere X to gain base and pincer black group.)]

(;W[le]MA[jp][jq]C[Should I instead have made territory at the bottom or on the left?

(DrK:

Most urgent move is still pincer at X for reasons explained before.

Your move M15 is a move aiming at reducing black's moyo and is playable but not as urgent. It's too thin though black can easily disconnect white and with white's group at top left being without a base it is not a good way to reduce. See variation.)]

;B[tt]C[Result:
White: 102 1/2 (and wishing he'd been less cocky and only given 1 stone)
Black: 111



(Conclusion: I think the following are things you can work on:

a. (As in move 41) Play solidly and form bases before attacking. See http://senseis.xmp.net/?StrategyForBeginners4Questions. I am 7k and still find these 4 questions helpful.
b. Study about 3-3 invasion. http://senseis.xmp.net/?33PointInvasion
c. Study pincer and use it often (especially in handicap games).
d. I also thought for many instances your moves are automatic responses from black. Try to seize initiatives as often as possible. But don't focus too much on that it is something in my experience to come to you very gradually.

I don't think you are being cocky wth black playing at least double the number of moves that are clearly mistakes - but I think the key reason for your losing was in ~move 26 when you leave two many weak white groups disconnected and open to be attacked by black. Half the game was you being attacked.

Also, you need to be careful with moves like 73. If black played correctly and have white's stones disconnected it would be an immediate victory. The lesson here I think is need to learn when to connect solidly and when thinly. Not to worry we are all learning I need to develop too.

Hope you enjoy the review and that you will improve!
