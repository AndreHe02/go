(;FF[1]GM[1]SZ[19]C[White's position became tenuous quite early due
to the play in the lower right corner. White gave up too much to for his
center profit.

The main lesson of this game involves paying attention to the twin issues of
connection and liberties. These issues are key ingedients in life and death
and in evaluating thickness, so they are actually more fundamental (bearing
attention on a move by move basis.)

In general, white is too willing to sacrifice stones. A group is not a
candidate for sacrifice unless it has exhausted its strategic purpose.  
A clump of stones separating two of the opponent's  living groups is a good
candidate for sacrifice because there is no strategic purpose in separating
two live groups.]PW[mi3ke]WR[3k]PB[unknown];B[pd];W[dp];B[oq];W[dc];B[de]

(;W[qm]C[Of course... this is my first mistake...

First example of the question of liberties and connections. When white
creates a gap in his position it is natural to expect the opponent to push
through.];B[qn];W[rn];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl];W[qk];B[no];W[mp];B[rq];W[ro];B
[pk];W[pj];B[oj];W[pi]C[I'm not too enthralled with my position, but
I don't think black has punished my mistake too harshly.

True! Moreover, black has just presented white with a great opportunity!
There is a gaping hole in his position when he plays M5.];B[lo]C[L4 is possibly the losing move. Black has made a gap in his
position, but white responds in kind!
Push through and cut!]
(;W[kp];B[lp];W[lq];B[mq]C[c is sente and solid. It makes the most of the aji
of the captured stones.]
(;W[ko]C[My goal was to build a position that would work with my marked stone
to make a little moyo, and I wanted to stay high so that I could prevent his
two center facing groups from working together.

I have second thoughts about this strategy now. I think I like the previous
variation where I play o2, then m3 better than this.

o2 then m3 is gote. L3 instead of L5 accomplishes your objective.   Note that m3 has only two
liberties.];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr];W[ln];B[mo];W[jq];B[jr]
(;W[ir]C[I've given him way too much profit already, I think I should have
played j3...

Absolutely! Things go  from bad to worse with
J2.];B[iq];W[hq];B[jp];W[ip];B[jo];W[kn];B[jq]C[You have lost o4 stones, m3
stones, and L6 stones have no strategic purpose. And J4, J2 and H3 are 3
stones with two cutting points.

That is hardly "staying high" or building "a little moyo".   Fighting spirit might cause you to perservere but this game is over.]
;W[oi]C[I was happy to get in p11 in sente.  at least the four stones will
earn me many kikashi.];B[nj];W[hn];B[jn];W[im];B[jm];W[jl]C[Black gets caught up in small local thinking
and almost lets you back in the game. C6 looks good to me.]
(;B[hp]C[I was very happy with black's decision to take the stone.  g4, g5
are exactly what I was looking for.  I don't feel quite so hideous about this
game as I did 10 moves ago.   Yes. Good instinct.];W[gp];B[io];W[go]C[G3 is also comparatively small.]

(;B[gq];W[fq];B[hr]C[At this point there aren't too many areas of the board
that are big.  black has more profit.  I decide to gamble that I can stop a
corner invasion and make some territory since I don't have anything to
attack.

C8 is a good move.];W[cl];B[dl];W[dm]C[black should extend into the center.  He would like to get the cut at J8.   White cannot get a huge corner because black still has F2]

(;B[ck];W[el];B[dk];W[bl]C[Black need not worry about the left and white's
corner is not that large. He should tenuki at R14.

Black is again thinking too locally. But, B9 is even wrong locally. E7 is the
move.]
(;B[bk]C[I am pretty happy here.  I get sente, and a remote possibility that
the corner is sage.    Plus black's upper left group isn't completely safe if I defend the c7 cut.  A black corner invasion that lives small might still be okay If it gives me
opportunities to pressure this group.    I figure I am going to have to keep sente if I am to win.

Black's B9 is terrible. He has now made 3 small moves in a row, and you are
almost back in the game.

White's R14 is very good.];W[qf];B[nd]
(;W[ld]C[I now have second thoughts about m16.  I should slide in at s16.

If he guards the corner *then* I can take m16 or m17.  More profit, *and*
more pressure.

If he extends down the side my f17 stone shines, and I get some nice corner
profit.

Correct strategic analysis. Because of F17, the top is not a desireable area
for either side.

Black's move is good.];B[re];W[qc];B[qd];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[rc];W[nc];B
[qb];W[od]C[dumb move.  I am trying to create a weak point, but all I do is throw
away liberties. I should leave it unplayed.

I think this move is just fine -
but you must follow it up.];B[oe]C[You must complete the shape. You cannot
tenuki.  Besides you can capture O15.]
(;W[ge]C[This probably too greedy.  h16 is more proper but I am starting to
worry that I don't have enough territory and black is thick everywhere but
the left side.  I feel I need to apply pressure there somehow.   Black is thick everywhere, period.

G15 does not affect left side nor does it make territory on top. It is
vague.];B[kc];W[kd];B[jc];W[ie];B[mc];W[md];B[ne];W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[nb]
;W[ic]C[Black probably has some way to escape with k17.  At the
least I've left him a lot of aji.  but sacking 3 stones makes g15 look ok.

I disagree. G15 looks very small. Think of it this way. Your 4 stones just
got caught in sente.  It works out to a 22 point loss. Disaster.

G2 is absolutely safe and sente for black. Here black is taking an
unnecessary risk.]
(;B[cp];W[cq];B[rg]
(;W[kl]C[I'm not going to play the extra move in the lower left.  I am
gambling the game that I can kill his invasion or get compensation without an
extra move.

l8 is perhaps misguided.  black's followup at s11 is big and severe, I
probably should have responded to s13.

I think L8 is ok. You can't win by following your opponent around the
board.];B[ri];W[rj];B[qi];W[qj]C[You are alive and black's gain was small. L8
is very thick.];B[dq];W[cr];B[ep];W[do]M[fq]C[Black should play F2.]

played a9

You can kill black, but the game would just be
