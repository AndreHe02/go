C[ET: Hi No specific questions in the game, but i would like you to focus on strategy. I know i play small moves but i cant tell which are small and why (explanations regarding this will be appreciated). I also would like you to show me reduction possibilities if i missed some and perhaps some better defenses against opponent reductions. Thanks in advance for your time and effort.


A:  I found the game interesting.
I think W began loosing because the invasion in the lower right corner left a weak group in the side. B did not take enough advantage of that mistake. Then W defended more or less well an early invasion in the upper left corner. I think you have to make more effort studying the status of surrounded groups. The invasion in the upper right corner should'nt have worked so easily for B. However, the Biggest mistakes were in establishing connections and caring for cutting points in the endgame, here W lost many points. Evaluating which sides have more potential to develop in the mid-game is not easy either if you cannot read two or three steps ahead. 

I wish you lots of success in your next games, Alberto];B[dp]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[dd];B[cf];W[fc];B[ef]CR[bd][di][dj]TR[dp]C[A: Normally black answers W's extension around the marked places. D10 or D11 emphasize the right side with help of the lower left corner stone. White's shimari prepares for an invasion around C12 later.]
;W[cn]CR[ck]MA[ch]C[A: I would try a a splitting wedge at C9 . It threatens to steal a base from the black stones in the upper left side with C12, or to extend to c6.]
;B[cl];W[dl]C[A: interesting move. trying new joseki for establishing position in the side?]

(;B[ck];W[en];B[fp];W[dk];B[dj];W[cm];B[ch]CR[cf][ef]C[A: Bc12 seems badly placed]
;W[ej];B[di]TR[cq][cc]C[A: the corners seem now points of equal value to me. I think you should just first protect your W group on the left side once more. If B claims one corner you could take the other one.]

(;W[cq]C[A: before invading, it is better to keep your W-side group strong]
;B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co];W[er]CR[ej][dk][dl][en][cn][cm]
TR[bo][cl]C[A: B can now connect to the upper left group now, what makes the white group in the center more weak when facing a fight.]

(;B[fq]C[A: now B is strong on the left side];W[eq]C[A: want to make B's position stronger? That way it makes it easy for B to attack W's left side group.]

(;B[rp]C[A: the joseki is played normally in O3-O4]
(;W[pn]C[A: I think, better O4];B[np]C[A: I feel that B won too much cash with this exchange, I'm not sure that this is an even result locally]
;W[qg];B[kq]C[A: I'm not sure if this is a little slow for B... the upper side seems appealing now]

(;W[mc]CR[pk]C[A: this seems big, but maybe at O9 would have been more solid against an invasion on the right side.]
;B[ic]
(;W[kd]CR[kc][kb]C[A: this move seems a little loose to me. It doesn't really put too much pressure against Black's stone because it can settle easily in the side by attaching at L17 or sliding at L18.  W is inviting B to jump out and link to its stone with the u.l. side.]
;B[ie];W[kf];B[ge];W[bd];B[cc]C[A: I tried for a while, and I couldn't kill W in this position. This is too early. The right side is much larger.]
;W[cd]
(;B[eb]C[A: usually at E17]

[rb][nb];B[pb]SQ[ra]C[A: S19 is a larger living shape]
(;W[pj]CR[pk]C[A: Maybe O9  better because it protects the stones in the l. r. corner.]
;B[pl]CR[pn][qo][pp][op]C[A: brave move, it attacks the weak shape of W in the lr corner.]

;B[nl]
(;W[ro]CR[kj][im]C[A: I think this is smaller than expanding W's right framework and reducing B's framework in the lower side.]
;B[kh]
(;W[lg]C[A: I think here W  looses a little.];B[lh];W[mh];B[kj]
CR[lh][kh]TR[ej][dk][dl][cm][cn][en][fm]C[A: this is success for B, because he reduced your moyo and can attack the left group.]

(;W[im];B[kl];W[hj];B[fj];W[fi]MA[ek][dm]C[A: W should have defended at F9. You need to protect the cutting points.]

[qj][qi][ri][rf][qf][sf]C[A: I see that the game is still good for W.
I count about 35 points for B on the lower right corner. 17 points on the left and upper side, and 4 points on the u-right corner = (maybe) 56 points. For W 39 points on the upper right side, 9 points on the left side, 5 points on the lower left corner, 8 points on the upper left corner + 6.5 komi = 67.5 points.]

(;W[hh]C[A: W's left  group is already safe, so stealing points in the lower side is much bigger.]
