C[
 Hello.  I am trickykid 11k* playing   black against jyr 11k*.     I am asking for a review because even   when I win I feel that I am playing badly.    My main concerns are fuseki and early
 joseki.. or strategy since you can't really
 call what I do joseki :)

 Thank you in advance.  - Aaron];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc]

 This move seems a little unusual
 to me, and j16 is the only way I can   think to answer.

J16 looks reasonable to me in this position.];B[id];W[dj]C[White wants to make a moyo.  Right now, you can invade at C3 C6 C8 C12 C14 or C17,
each of which will help white turn the moyo into territory.  Since there are so many invasion points, it is not urgent to invade at this time, so you should take a big point.
Big points right now for black are F3 (limits whites moyo) Q10 (makes a big black moyo)
or somewhere around O17 (makes a moyo at the top).  THis is a moyo vs moyo game so far, so you need to think about whos moyo is bigger.  If your moyo is bigger, then you should expand it, and if the opponents moyo is bigger you should reduce it.]
;B[nc]C[Reasonable.  Your moyo on the top is about as big as white's on the left.]
;W[nq]C[OK, white wants to limit/reduce your moyo.]
(;B[fq]C[
 I didn't want to go moyo vs. moyo by
 q6 direction.

It is OK if you don't want to play moyo games, but in this case, you moyo looks
bigger than white's moyo if you just respond at Q6.
Starting a fight near whites moyo will help turn it into territory.  If you don't want to expand your area, then you should probably attack the white stone with a pincer.]
;W[hq]C[If we just look at the lower half of the board, white has 4 stones to black's 2, so fighting will be easier for white here.]

(;B[cn]C[
 I don't like the way this turned out. The way
 it turned out was almost good, but I didn't  like my shape If white played differently I  think it  would have been worse.

This move is probably not a good idea.  White has a lot of stones in this area, while
you have only 2, so fighting will be favorable for white.  I would just jump into the
3-3 point or run out into the center.  This move might be OK if you intend to sacrifice the F3 stone to break oup the left side, but I thing that would give white too much.]

(;W[eq]C[White is too nice here, making this weak stone stronger.]
;B[fp];W[co]
(;B[hp]C[You should make your weak stone at C6 stronger.
You will get either E5 or H5 later to take care of this group.]

(;W[iq];B[ip]C[Making C6 stronger is still urgent.];W[jp];B[jq]
C[I assume you plan to sacrifice this stone to get some advantage?  Remember you owe white a move around Q6.  If white gets a move in that area, the Q4 stone will be in trouble.]

 Lack of reading, either t2 or ko later instead
 of r1.  Or perhaps some other move?];W[sr];B[ns];W[sq];B[qs]

 Any comment on this move?

It makes some center territory, but you have too many weaknesses near the bottom.
White should still be able to break into the]

 h6?

The two stones at F5 are not important. If white captures them, it is 4 points. You need to strengthen you connections across the bottom.]

 Saw that coming.

You left too many weaknesses behind.];B[lp];W[ln];B[nm];W[io]

 I always realize after I do this that
 it will weaken the right side a bit,
 but still it seems the thing to do.];W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be]

 Basically a wasted move i think.

Yes, much like passing. You should defend your territory at the top right.
The game looks difficult for black now. White has 40+ points of solid territory, while
black only has the  upper right and some small stuff in the center.

You should try to keep your stones more connected and aviod fights where your opponent is stronger.]
