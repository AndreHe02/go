C[Hi, I'm Chinese 3D. This is my 1st review for GTL, I'll try my best to do it better. And hope it will help you.
--- by Randy


I'm playing as black, with 0.5 komi (My opponent is 3k, I am 4k)

There was alot of trading back and forth of big groups, and a few horrendous blunders, and the game ended up even more out of accident than anything else it seems, but I'm still submitting it for review, since I was lost for a winning strategy all the way trough the game, and need guidance and ideas on specific tactical situations.

Thanks in advance!];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj];W[nq]
(;B[oo]C[This move is OK but not usual. Normally you can consider play at Q6 or M3. See my branches.
--- Randy


This is an opening I've played alot in the past and then abandoned, tho I try it out from time to time.]
;W[jp];B[mp];W[mq];B[lp];W[pr]C[Of course the next step M3 is right.
--- Randy

I've never had anyone fail to walk with me all the way to L3 until this game; did I follow up correctly, and what other options to white have?]
;B[lq];W[qq];B[or]C[This move is unnecessary, just play at R4 is better.
--- Randy];W[oq];B[pq];W[qr]C[Yes.
--- Randy

Should I play R4 here at once?];B[fq]C[The idea here is to put preasure on either of the white stones/groups here]
;W[hq];B[fo];W[er]C[Your next move F2 is right. White has weekness point at D3 anyway.
---Randy

Is this an acceptable way to play for white? It seems a good move, covering the corner, but I've seen it rarely in games. If wrong, how to I punish it?]
;B[fr];W[dn];B[hp]C[This move is bad. While attacking, try not touch opponent's week stones.  I will play at H6.
--- Randy];W[gp];B[gq];W[ho];B[ip];W[io];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr]
C[No, G5 is righ.
Now, you see, because of the H4's bad move, white gave up 2 stones and make itself safe.
---Randy


Guess I should just capture at H2 here?];B[go];W[lr];B[mr];W[nr]
;B[kr];W[ms];B[ks]C[why not go at K2? although there is a ko.
you didn't really cut white's group because of J1...

--- Randy];W[jn]C[Thought I had cut him good at this point, so I plan to chase him and build a wall to the right.]
;B[ln];W[is];B[hr];W[kq]C[That plan in pieces, I block off white's entry to the right edge.]
;B[qp];W[nc]C[Here I had a hard time choosing between O16 P15 and Q18 (dismissed R14, it seemed overcrowded); with such influence on the right, what's the right choice?]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[qc]C[Another unexpected move.]
(;B[oc]C[wrong direction.

---randy];W[qe]LB[re:A]C[White's bad move. S15 is a right move.

--- Randy];B[qd];W[rd]LB[rc:A]C[Should be like this following steps... see viriation:

--- randy]
(;B[mc];W[nb];B[lc];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[rc];W[qb];B[re];W[rb]
;B[sd];W[nj]C[don't know why, obviously kill right-up conner is big. 
--- randy

VERY unexpected tenuki. Isn't white just giving away almost 30 points, and declaring all his moves there wasted?]
;B[sb];W[pk];B[oj];W[ok]C[Here I feel I am strong enough to fight this out. Either I get the entire right, or the top right and huge influence towards center.]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[mk];W[no];B[np]TR[pk][ok][nl]C[no need to cut this stone, play at O6 is better. your target is the middel 3 stones.

--- Randy];W[op];B[nn];W[po];B[on];W[qo];B[qn];W[rp];B[pn]C[Not bad as long as you can make sure the right field is all yours. but seems not...
--- randy



Is the stones I just gave up worth the strenght on the right?]
;W[qj];B[qi];W[pi];B[oi];W[ri]C[Q12 is better.
--- randy


Wasn't sure if I should play R12 or Q12 here];B[ph];W[qk]C[Again a dillema, limit eyespace from the top or the bottom?]
;B[rl];W[rn];B[qm];W[qh];B[qg];W[pi];B[oh];W[rg];B[qi];W[rh]
;B[rk];W[pg];B[qf];W[pf];B[rf]C[Yes. You  don't have to worry about Q15 at all.
---Randy

By reflex I went for the move that limited eyespace, but it seems that Q15 has less aji for later, and that the eye doesn't matter, am I correct?]
;W[ml];B[lk];W[ll];B[ol];W[kk];B[mi];W[kj];B[li];W[cj];B[fc]
;W[df]
(;B[fe]C[Maybe. 
If I were you, I'd chosen D18.
see variation.
--- randy

Too ambitious?];W[jc];B[kb]C[another bad move.
should be at L16

--randy];W[ke];B[jb];W[ld];B[jh];W[kc]C[Didn't see this one. Is my continuation the best when I realize it's dead?]
;B[lb];W[ib]
(;B[ic];W[hb];B[hc];W[gb];B[jd];W[kd];B[je];W[kf];B[fb];W[ja]
;B[gc];W[la]C[Considered K14 here, but didn't think it urgent enough, and it's as gote as it gets.]
;B[ce];W[de];B[ch];W[cf]C[Saw my chance to make a real attack here on the left, either on the lone stone or the heavy one.]
;B[eh];W[ej];B[cc]C[Better play at B13 first.
--- randy


Is this the right aproach? Should I play B13 first, or B17 instead?]
;W[cd];B[bc];W[bd]C[I see I can't live in the corner, but figure I'm connected out.]
;B[bg];W[eb];B[db];W[dc];B[cb]LB[ca:A]C[this move better played at D19

--- randy];W[ff];B[gh];W[ge];B[fd];W[fg];B[fh];W[hg]C[I read out that G13 and H14 cut, but realized too late that I would be cut in turn. What other options to I have? By now it seems to me white has buildt up a lead if I don't invade deeply or kill somewhere.]
;B[gg];W[gf];B[hf];W[ec];B[ea];W[da]C[This move is a nice warning shot to me, he's telling me he's confident in killing me, but the move doesn't actually help for that purpose. So I reread and find he can indeed kill me unless I connect; but I still want something from this deal, so I go for the ko.

Upon second reading, it seems I can get a semeai that I win, can you confirm this? Check the variation.]

(;B[ga];W[ka];B[ie];W[fa]C[Thought long and hard about n19 as a ko threat, but in the end figured he'd have enough liberties in the upper right corner.]
;B[ko];W[ha];B[jo];W[js]C[Ok, so I have a shot at a huge center, but what move is best to cut him off from the left? G8? G9? Something threatening his left directly first?]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[hk];W[gm];B[fm];W[jl]C[I can't see where he'll get two eyes from, but I answer just to be sure, since I think I have him surrounded now.]
;B[km];W[ik];B[jm];W[im];B[hl]C[I thought this was sente, that I could just play J8 if he doesn't.]
;W[fl]C[But J8 here and I'm dead in a ladder...];B[fn]LB[em:A]
C[this move why not at E7?
would be better.
--- randy];W[hj];B[gj];W[il];B[gk];W[hi]C[And here I spend most of my time. A bit late perhaps, cause I couldn't find any easy ways out, I have to connect, and then he'll play H12 and cut my J15 group off]
;B[fj];W[ih]C[I really expected H12 here, but this works in the end too. What can I play here to keep him cut and me connected? I have white J14 to worry about...]

(;B[ig];W[jg];B[hh];W[kh];B[ii];W[ki]C[Ok, so nothing of mine dies, but he escapes aswell. Way behind at this stage, and again I go for the kill]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[cm];W[dm];B[dk];W[ck];B[cn];W[co]C[And I shake my head at myself, realizing it's hopeless. Considered resigning, but then I remembered the T18 he didn't play...]

(;B[dg];W[eg]C[Seems his greed is his downfall here.];B[ci]
;W[cg];B[ei];W[dg];B[bl]C[almost same.

Do I have time to play B5 first? Does it make any difference?]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[dq]C[Kill!];W[eq]LB[cq:A]C[very bad move of white.

--- randy


Oh no, he lives again? Any combination of L8/J10/K10 I can pull off, and fight out the ko at Q11 for the game?]
;B[og];W[ij]C[I am low on time now, the rest of the moves are kind of hurried endgame, making sur eI don't lose on time. In the end he won by a hair and a half, could I have won with better endgame?]
