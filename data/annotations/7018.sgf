C[Hello, I'll be reviewing your game and I hope I can help you two out.  You can email me at makubesu@gmail.com if you have any questions.

White played well in the early game, but black played well in the end game.  Please don't just follow my comments, but also look at your opponents moves when you were losing, and learn to be just as good.]

C[I don't like this move.  When attacking early in the game, you shouldn't play this close, because it gives white control of the pace.  Try something more standard, and use it to put pressure on both white stones at the top.]

C[Notice how by trying to secure the cross in the top left black has allowed white a whole bunch of free moves.  Only take a KO when you have to or when you're trying to force a fight.]
;W[hk];B[ik]TR[gk]C[This isn't going to work right here, as you'll see.  Stay simple and contain white.  Corners are very strong, so don't try and cut unless there is a huge gap.]
;W[il];B[ij];W[ck];B[dk]TR[el]C[This is another case of black playing too close to white when attacking.  Remember that white needs to expand in order to make two eyes, so start by containing.]

;W[gl];B[hj];W[hl];B[jj];W[kl]C[I recommend that black play C4 first.  It'll secure the left, but keep the intiative.]

;B[me];W[lf];B[mf];W[mg];B[mh]C[I'm sure black sees the mistake here.  Don't let it bother you, when you're new you just don't have the experience to know the little things you have to avoid.  Keep playing and you'll learn to avoid these situations.]
;W[lh];B[jg];W[kg];B[jf];W[jh];B[ih];W[ci]TR[cj]C[Now here black can be more agressive.]

(;B[ch];W[bi];B[bh];W[cj];B[ai]
(;W[aj]C[As you'll see later, white, this is a bad shape.  Go problems are the best way to learn how to avoid this.]
;B[ah];W[af];B[ae];W[be];B[gd];W[gc];B[gb]C[This move right here is suicide, don't just jump into your oponents territory, though I'm guessing black was desperate at this point.]
;W[hd];B[fc];W[ge];B[ec]
(;W[fb]TR[db]C[White is being too aggressive with this cut.  You're weak on the left side, and black doesn't have much room on the right, so I recommm]
;B[eb];W[hb]TR[db]C[Go left instead]
(;B[fa];W[db];B[cb]
(;W[da]C[White's mistake right here, there is nothing wrong with playing the more cautious C11.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[ca];W[bb];B[ea];W[ba];B[bf];W[ad]C[Consider A12 black, it would destroy white at the top.]

(;B[ag];W[ab];B[ae];W[ha];B[ic]C[auedon1 [-\]: good moves, you stole that from me :-)]
;W[hc]C[Seeker [?\]: I think youll win tho];B[id];W[ie]C[Seeker [?\]: this mis only my 4th game
auedon1 [-\]: yes, hard to win with no corners];B[ak]C[Seeker [?\]: one lasy gasp
auedon1 [-\]: if you go to the brginner's room there is a very good web site in the window there with a set of tutorial problems

Very good move black!  As a beginner, don't be afraid to cut in random places during the end game in order to learn about weaknesses like this.]
;W[bj];B[cl]C[Seeker [?\]: thx];W[cm];B[bk]C[auedon1 [-\]: looks like I should go there to learn how to defend :-)]

;W[kc];B[ia];W[jb];B[ga]C[Tough luck white, black made some good moves in the top right.  A key part of this scenario is that even though you thought your territory was secure, black had some stones inside of it.  That's when you need to be cautious, especially on a small board.]

Seeker [?\]: WOW.
auedon1 [-\]: good luck with your game

Here is some general advice for both of you.  Black: in the early parts of the game, try and look at the big picture.  White came out ahead because he was able to spread out well, while you were all bunched up.

White: play more small board games.  They'll teach you about good shape in the end game.  Also, when you're ahead by a lot, keep your guard up.  Games like this happen to everyone.

Hope this review helped, let me know if there's something I missed or if you have a question.  Happy Holidays.]
