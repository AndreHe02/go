C[   Hello !
 I'm Tilwen, black in this even game. It's mostly about a big center moyo and how to deal with it, I won eventually, but it was close and he made the last mistakes, so I think I could have lost also. I'll put questions all along the game, I think I'm asking quite a lot of things. Thanks for your help !

;B[cq];W[eq];B[ep]C[I wanted to try this answer, he didn't follow joseki but I think it ended not badly for him, maybe I could have taken more ?
I show in variation the joseki I was expecting.];W[fp];B[eo]
(;W[fo];B[do]C[I cut here, thinking I could get a nice corner and white get influence. Pushing at E6 instead, then white connecting at D3 seemed bad for black. Maybe could have ataried at D3, white would have connected and gotten influence ? Did I went wrong at some point ?

Az: This may be the first time I've said this in a gtl review (since normally I get game review requests from idiots and you're not an idiot), but I'm not sure. The result in game looks just fine for black and all of your moves seemed forced when I went back and looked for other choices.]
;W[en];B[co];W[fr]C[Here, should I take D3 ? It seemed small, I prefered to play C6 to go out, but then white has sente.

Az: Up to here the result looks fine for black. White has a nasty cutting point at F6 which limits his influence.]
;B[cn];W[op]C[There is still a cut at F6, I didn't know how to make it work so I waited until white fixed it. At least teh lower right black corner is nice, but not that big, and white's influence seems fair too.

Then big question here, where to play ? As usual I was afraid of white getting a big sphere of influence on the lower side, so I considered pincering (high), but pincer or Q6 didn't seem easy or better than the usual P3 that I played. What do you think ?

Az: I like p3 from game. A pincer seems decidely bad, you're going to fight in the once place on the board where white is strongest. I don't think that you need to start stressing out about a moyo of doom, its not that impressive.]
;B[oq];W[nq];B[pq];W[nm]C[I was kind of surprised  (i was thinking O4, R6, and then something like this probably) but I took points, losing sente again, and thinking white was quite thin, so this could be reduced or invaded. Is there a time in the game when I could/should have taken advantage of it ?]
;B[qm]C[Az: I still feel that black is doing fine, white's influence isn't so impressive and black has a thick position.]
;W[jd]C[Moyo directed ...]
(;B[de]C[I approched here and ended the joseki with D19, thinking this would help to reduce. Was this approach good, should white have pincered ?

Az: Approaching is common sense, but this is a bit close since white has K4 there...]
(;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]
(;B[df];W[fc];B[dj]C[The cut at F6 looks more and more promising ...]
;W[nc]C[Once again, I played solidly to be able to make something against his moyo.]
(;B[qg];W[dl]C[Maybe now opening begins to be over, were my choices good ? How must I think now to take advantage in the game ? And by the way, is now my position better or worse than white's, is it fair ?

I had in mind than O2 could reduce , than M17 or H17 could invade, but I don't feel as if I had that much points compared to white's moyo.

Az: The game feels pretty even to me, maybe a bit better for black. I really can't see any big mistakes for either side so far (maybe thats just trauma from reviewing lots of kyu player games). However, jumping with F10 feels decidely slow and doesn't have much effect on white. I think you should cut.]
(;B[fj]C[This was in order to reinforce D14 group and to enter white's moyo.]
;W[qi]C[This was surprising too. Should I attack this stone, trying to enter white's moyo, should I take more points ?

Az: This looks bad to me, you can just protect your corner and then white has a liability later on.]
;B[pc]C[I defended the corner to make it alive and aim at m17.

Az: Again, looks fine.];W[qn]
(;B[pn]C[This is in direction of the o4 weakness ...];W[qo]
;B[po];W[rm];B[rl]TR[qi]C[I wasn't afraid of white making a ponnuki, because the upper right corner is solid.

Az: Big mistake. The UR may be solid but W r11 is weak and white is generally thin in this area of the board. The root of the problem was hane on top earlier.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[rk]C[So I took a big corner :)];B[rn];W[sl];B[ro]
C[But still gote

Az: Compare this to the variation where you hane under. This is maybe 5-6 points better but you made white so strong and took gote.]
;W[ne]LB[og:A]C[and white defends a weakness here. What should I do here, invade somewhere, reducing white's moyo ?

I was trying to estimate the whole position, but I didn't know how to do it, could you help me ?
Lower right and left corners are blakc points as upper right, upper left is white points, but how to estimate the upper side, and the lower moyo ? And how many points can we count in all these areas ?

Az: If not for the disaster on the right hand side you could jump out threatening white's stone. I don't "know" the best continuation, but I don't think you should invade the top, its too solid. The bottom is the big undecided question.]
(;B[hc]LB[ne:A]C[This was a try, like bumping a bomb and see what would happen. probably not a good idea ...

Az: You are invading between two strong positions (thanks to W reinforcing at A). How did you think you were going to get a good result from this?]
;W[he]
(;B[jb]
(;W[kb]C[Az: Bad move by white, you must hane.]
(;B[jc];W[kc];B[gd]LB[jc:A][kc:B]C[Az: Skip the A-B exchange if you don't want to hane, it does nothing for you.]
;W[ei]C[Nice move it seems. my tobi wasn't probably nice.]
(;B[di];W[ge];B[fd];W[eh];B[ed]C[I was thinking this was sente agains the corner, it appeared to be true later.

Az: Sente is a strong word but this is the only move now.];W[ej]
;B[ek]C[Probably a mistake again, D9 and C8 would be lots of points now that I see this.

Az: This is pointless. Play one of those or just tenuki, you've made a hash of this area starting from the invasion.]
;W[dk];B[kd]C[Again a try, I was quite worried by white's moyo ^^

Az: You should be, you're making it bigger and bigger. However, this is overtly unreasonable. Panicing won't fix anything.]
(;W[je]C[Az: W should give up the 2 stones, but either way is good for him.]
;B[og];W[mg];B[mq];W[mp];B[nr];W[lq];B[np]LB[kd:A][je:B][ej:C]
C[Seems like nice endgame for me ? Still don't know who is ahed here ...

Az: Your moves here seemed forced, but A-B is a big minus for you. W's moyo wasn't very impressive until W was able to push through with C (a result of a bad invasion up top).]
;W[lp];B[mj]C[I was quite proud of this move, a bit afraid of white cutting it, but had some confidence than I could link somehow :)]
;W[kj];B[ml];W[lk];B[mm];W[km]
(;B[mk];W[rh];B[md]LB[rh:A]C[These two moves helped me later, but it was a bit silly I think ^^

Az: These are terrible exchanges, you need to answer W's move.]

(;W[bf];B[bg];W[be]C[White still isn't completely alive, as it appeared later.]
(;B[dh];W[gh];B[lr];W[kr];B[jr]C[Trying again, but getting a ko was good for me, with the upper right corner being weak.

Az: In general, count before starting any ko. Not only the score on the board but the number of threats you think are big enough. It can be +/- 1 but you need to have a sense of whehter you have more or less threats, don't rely on hope and "fighting spirit".]
;W[ls];B[ms];W[mr];B[cc];W[dd]C[Az: Bad ko threat. You gave yourself a cutting point on the outside and lost points here.]
;B[lr];W[ff]C[I was maybe too confident but the cut didn't worry me too much because the corner isn't alive yet.]
;B[ks];W[ee];B[bj];W[gb];B[gc];W[fa];B[hb]C[Az: This is a dangerous ko fight for you which you shouldn't have gotten into. The only reason w had this threat was because you made a bad threat.]

;W[bd];B[lc];W[le]
(;B[kq];W[jp]
(;B[ko]C[Maybe just cutting is enough ? Once more, how to count the points now ? (or just before playing this mive maybe).

Az: I count by pairs, so each pair of points is "1". That way each capture on the board still is "1". Teach yourself to count. And cutting is bigger than this peep nonsense since you should end in sente.]

Az: Big oops. You were winning comfortably before this.];W[ho]

;W[sg];B[sf];W[sh];B[qh];W[ri];B[re];W[pa];B[qa];W[li]C[I had the feeling P19 was very big. Now it's clearly endgame, did I do some mistakes around ?]
(;B[oa];W[bl];B[er];W[bk];B[fn]C[Stupid once more ^^

Az: Yeah, don't do that.
