C[An interesting game.  Black gets a large lead in the opening, but fails to make a key group thick enough, and white uses that weakness to attack in the middle game and catch up.]

(;W[nq]C[i guess that was a mistake? if yes how to punish? o6?

Yes.  The joseki is for white to push up once more.  Turning at o6 for black now is good since it increases the strength of your wall.]

;W[bj];B[aj];W[dj];B[ai];W[gi]C[Any idea how to react here better than i did?

Now you will chase white into your moyo, and you have a weak group yourself in the center instead of a wall.  You didn't reduce the white territory any more than the jump to B11.]

(;B[cf]C[Don't play a stone in a ladder that doesn't work.  You could try using these stones as aji instead.]

(;B[ke]LB[ff:A]C[that was the loosing move i guess. it was a misclick but since it was a tournament game i didn't asked if i could take it back. i wanted to play on k15. what can i do better from here

K15 is better of course.  You might peep first to help your connection on the upper side.

Now you can see how important it is to have a black stone at A.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[jd];W[ie]
(;B[hb]C[You should look at extending at G16.  In a crosscut extending is often better than the atari.]
;W[nd];B[od];W[fc]
(;B[fb]C[Too fancy.  Just capture a stone.  Then you are stong and connected, and you get more points or sente to close the center.

This is the key mistake that leads to the weakness in the center and eventual loss of the game.

Making your groups strong like this is really important.  YOu played the opening really well, but you failed to make your groups thick in the middle game, and it cost you the game.]
;W[gc];B[gb];W[pi];B[rj];W[kf];B[le]LB[gc:A]C[If you had captured at A you would be able to hane now instead of submitting.]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[mk]
(;B[mi]C[Extending the other way is stronger because it keeps you connected.]
;W[oj];B[nk];W[ri];B[sk];W[oh];B[og];W[ii]
(;B[ih]C[Too fancy.  Just make the usual answer and your group is stronger (because he has fewer forcing moves against it).  This move gives him additional sente moves later.]

C[i just didnt see that move .. i was only looking at my group

This puts white ahead, but you lost earlier by letting your center groups get weak.]

(;B[lf]LB[gc:A]C[It seems you are worried about something here to tenuki and defend, but I don't see it.  

In any case there would be no issue in this area if you had captured one stone at A long ago.

Since your lower group is a little thin, defending in the lower left is much bigger than it looks.]
;W[ng];B[mg];W[mh];B[kg];W[ni];B[gf]C[thought that would work gaain it didn't

Also, you end in gote, so it's a big loss.];W[gg];B[gh];W[ge]
;B[fd];W[dr];B[cq];W[fr]C[White finds a really good move here.  After white destroys this territory he is way ahead.

No more comments.  The key lesson from this game is to choose thicker moves.]

I don't think so.]
