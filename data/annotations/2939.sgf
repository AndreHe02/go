;W[jc]LB[lp:C][mp:B][iq:A]C[Chyn: Should I invade around A or B?

I don't think so, an invasion would be premature. 

C is another good point to target in this framework.  It is important to note that the stone in the center bottom is a little misplaced, Black wishes it were on the star point.]
;B[oc]LB[pc:B][qf:A]C[Slightly misplaced.  This leaves aji in the corner, the proper play with the large night's extension is to play B.  If the extension were at A then this play would be proper.]
;W[dj]LB[ci:B][do:E][jo:D][iq:C][dr:A]TR[fq]C[Chyn: Is point A better

No.  If you play A black will happily invade at B (note that there is no other point on the side that will work because only there can black make a two space extension in both directions).

You can then pincer the marked stone in the lower left, but black can resist because of the thickness in the lower right.  White C could be answered at D.  Also, Black has an interesting point left at E, so he can be satisfied with the aji left in his stone.  It would be premature to set the stone into motion now, but at the proper time the stone can be activated to good effect.

Note that White's play also makes a large scale connection between the upper side and the lower left.  The double wing formation in the upper left is very desirable as well.]

C[Black should first play at A, white will play one point to the right of A, the purpose being to create cutting points.

Also, the invasion is not necessarily an overplay, but it is more of a probe to see how White will respond, Black must play very lightly into White's sphere of influence.]

C[Chyn: Black is too big, so I try reducing, is
this reasonable?

yes, this is a good point to start from too, the one that feels best to me, White might also look at A which threatens B and C]

;W[ol];B[je];W[id]LB[gb:C][he:B][ie:A][cr:D]C[this is a little slow, you might consider a play at A or B instead, also you could tenuki, both C and D are large points]

;B[fm];W[ck]LB[ck:A][dk:C][bm:D][cr:B]C[Chyn: Is this a waste move?

Yes, a play at B would be ideal here because then you don't have to worry about the cut at C (after Black A) and can respond with D, which definitely kills the black stones.

If the lower half of the white position was lacking for eye space then this type of connection would be fine.]

;B[mm];W[nl]LB[nk:C][nl:B][lm:A]C[Chyn: I believe this is a mistake

Yes, you should play at A (the key point in the position), you can look at the alternate branch to see the sequence but if black wedges at B you reply at C and there is no way for Black to seperate your stones.]

;B[li];W[qh];B[rg];W[pg]LB[ph:B][rh:A]C[Chyn: Should I play at A?

In this position there is not much chance of either player making much territory in the center so A would be a better point.  However, if taking territory were your goal then playing at A initially would be proper (instead of B).]
;B[sj];W[rj];B[sk]LB[si:A]C[This is a mistake, Black should draw back to A]

C[Premature, this play is worth only about 4-5 points and it is gote.  Compare this with a play at A, for example.]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[of];B[pe];W[mh];B[mi];W[sp];B[rq];W[ni]
LB[gb:A]C[Chyn: Is A point bigger?

Yes, the center is unattractive for territorial purposes so preserving as much side terrirtory is key (also, A is the largest point on the board right now so the move you made would have to be worth around 20 points to be larger than A)]
