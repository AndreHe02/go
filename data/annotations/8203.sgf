C[Hi Safa

I am Saurus, 4-5 kyu on KGS, and I will be reviewing your game for the black side.

You asked for me to determine your rank - it is a bit difficult from one game, but I would guess you to be about 15 kyu on KGS.

I think the area in which you most need to improve is the consistency of your moves. You tend to play a move with a purpose in mind, but then you don't follow through, and tenuki too early, or you change your mind, because you are scared of an opponent's approach, and suddenly start to play defensively from an attacking position. I have pointed out where you could have improved on these aspects, especially in the opening.

Secondly, you are too afraid of your opponent, and tend to play too defensively. You need to take control of the game. Play forcefully, and make your opponent scared of you, rather than the other way around. 

I would like you to try an experiment for the next few games. Find a weak opponent group, attack it, and keep the pressure on that group as long as possible. When the white group can no longer be attacked, find another weak group and attack it, and again, try and keep it under pressure as long as possible. Do this again and again until there are no weak groups left to attack. Only then should you start to play big territorial moves. Don't respond to any opponent's moves unless it is absolutely necessary for the stability or survival of your group. The goal is to (a) try and dominate the flow of the game, and to (b) practise building pressure on your opponents groups before playing tenuki. I think you will be amazed at how easy it is to secure territory doing it this way compared to playing passive/defensive territorial moves.

Summary of key points:
1) Once you have decided on a strategy, stick to it until it you have reached that goal.
2) Don't tenuki too early. Keep your opponent under pressure at all times, and don't tenuki until you can't pressurize your opponent any further.
3) Conquer your fears. Go is as much a psychological game as a game of skill. He with the strongest will wins. Before each move, say to yourself " I have no fear" and play a bold attacking move rather than back away and play defensively. You may lose a few games at first, because of failure to protect  your groups, but you will automatically get a happy balance between the two, and will end up a stronger player as a result.
4) Try and split your opponent groups apart whenever possible. I have given an example in the game of how you could have used a splitting attack effectively.

I hope you enjoy my review and find it useful
Regards
Saurus];B[dp];W[cn];B[pq]C[The 4-4 stone is quite flexible, so tenuki here is fine.]
;W[qo];B[cq]C[This stone is inconsistent with the last two stones that you played for a number of reasons, and also goes against some basic principles.

1) The 4-4 stone at d4 has certain goals - it can easily escape to the center, so it's strong and flexible, and should be used for attacking. Usually, you want to make a long extension from a 4-4 stone, force your opponent to invade your moyo, and then attack the invading stone strongly. It is no good for making territory in the corner. On the other hand, c3 is highly territorial, and can always live in the corner. If you wanted to take this corner, play c3 only. Why play two stones to take the corner when you can take it with one? With both these stones together, d4 looks rather useless.

2) Even if you were going to take the corner with two stones, c4 is much  better than c3, for two reasons: a) The c4/d4 wall puts strong pressure on c6; b) Ic4 takes more points in the corner, since white cannot invade there anymore anyway.

3) A 3-4 stone such as q3 is not very flexible, and cannot get out into the center easily. Therefore, you need to respond to an approach towards it immediately , if possible, because it will be severely attacked otherwise. Thus, it was much more important to support q3, rather than d4.

My suggestion for the best move here would be b-o4, which works well with the d4 stone to build a moyo, and is sente, because it also threatens the r5 stone.]
;W[en];B[iq]C[This move is a good idea, since it is an extension from both stones.]
;W[oo];B[dd]C[Q3 is now dead if you don't respond! You cannot play such an important stone, and then allow it to get murdered. If you didn't want this corner, then don't play there in the first place. Again, this is a consistency problem. 

B-o4 was urgent!];W[cf]C[You are so lucky that white did not kill the bottom right!]
;B[ee]C[This does not put any pressure on c14, as white can live with w-c17.

It would be much better to simply play f17 or f16, thereby marking out some potential territory at the same time.

Always play a move which has two purposes.];W[eg];B[pd]C[Good! It is always a good idea to take the last corner!]
;W[nc];B[kd]C[Yes! The pincer works very well with the d16/e15 stones.

L16 is a very nice move.];W[ne];B[pf];W[gf]
(;B[ge]C[This is too ambitious.

All your stones are on the fourth line, so a white invasion underneath will live. For example, you cannot stop a white invasion at j16 now.

Since L16 is high, it is designed to attack, not to make territory. Thus, you should rather use it to attack, for example, by playing m14.

If you wanted safe territory along the top, L16 should have been low (at L17).

Consistency of purpose is the key!];W[qh]
(;B[pj]C[Fighting with the two corner stones is the correct strategy.

However, you have overlooked an important fighting concept - the splitting attack!

Always split two weak groups if you can.

B-p13 would have done this very effectively.

[See variation for how to use a splitting attack\]];W[kb];B[ic]
C[Too passive.

This white group can now live easily, and if w-p12 first, your two corner stones are in big trouble.

You should continue to use your two corner stones to attack the weak r12 stone.]
;W[gn];B[gp];W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[You are letting white push you around the board, and at the same time, white is building a very large territory.

Which is bigger - white's moyo or your corner?

Obviously, white's moyo is bigger. Therefore, it is more important to reduce this moyo, rather than protect a smaller corner.

[See variation\]];W[pb];B[ng]C[Too late!

The top white group is alive, and so this move only attacks one side. It's white's turn to play, so he can spend his next move protecting his other weak group. Then, there is nothing left to attack.

You need to play moves like this as early as possible, before your opponent gets a chance to defend.]
;W[rj];B[pm]C[No! This move forces white to kill the corner. Always attack from the weaker side.

B-o4 is the only move, and attacks the two stones from the weaker side, thereby making territory along the bottom at the same time.]
;W[np]C[White gets the key point.

Now, the corner will die and white lives easily.

If you took this point first, then you would make very big territory on the bottom and the two white stones are in trouble.]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[ih];B[kf]C[What is the purpose of L14?

It makes no territory.
It threatens nothing.
It protects nothing, as it extends from a living group.
It connects nothing, as w-n14 still cuts.

Moves such as these must be avoided, since they are the same as a pass, and this early in the game, it's pretty much like giving your opponent a free handicap stone.

On the other hand, the q16/q14  stones can be cut off from the rest, so they are in deep trouble. You need to fix these first.]
;W[lp];B[kq];W[rq];B[ko];W[im];B[nn];W[jk]C[Proverb: "Attack from a distance"

Playing a contact move here allows white to strengthen white his weak group.]
;B[no];W[op];B[pp];W[bc];B[km]C[This allows white to cut at p3, taking the whole corner.

This is too big to allow! p3 was forced!

(See next move for variation)]
(;W[po]C[[See variation on how white could punish you here.\]]

This move should have been elsewhere. Playing here is like passing again.]
;W[pr];B[ps];W[os];B[kh]C[Where is the potential territory to be made with L12?

There are much bigger sente moves such as b5, r18, m18.];W[cb]
;B[db];W[bo]C[See, playing a move that white did not have to respond to at L12 means that white gets all these big points instead.]
;B[hf];W[gg];B[hg];W[hh];B[ff];W[fg];B[df];W[dg]C[The last few movces are all dame - they are worth no points, but you are forcing white to solidify his territory, thereby removing any little hope you had left of reducing him further.

White can say "thank you" after each move.];B[ce]C[From here, it's really just dame, except for a mistake on black's part in failing to connect the o6 stones, although it didn't change the outcome.
