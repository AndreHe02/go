C[I'm black. My opponent resigned but I lost about 20moku.

Sirkut> Hi.  I'll preceed all my comments with 'Sirkut>', the name I use on KGS.  I hope I'll be able to provide some useful tips.  Keep in mind though that you often get the most out of reviews if you submit slower games, such as ones that are 30 minutes or longer.  Since you didn't ask many questions, I'll also comment on what I feel are important situations.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj];W[dj];B[jd];W[nq]TR[qd][qj]C[Sirkut> The fourth line is more influence than territory, so it is a good idea in the openning to balance your stones between the two.  Playing R16 and R10 instead would be an example of this.]
;B[pn];W[jp];B[fc];W[df];B[jj]TR[hc]C[Sirkut> This is very aggressive move.  At this point at least, it's more important to protect your last stone by playing something like H17 which would give you a nice strong block of moyo.]
;W[hc]TR[cc][dc][fe][ge]C[This pincer kind of scared me.

Sirkut> You'll get used to them. :)  Your options are to either make it it's own base, like a D17 or C17, or to push into the center so you can escape  with F15 or G15.  I would recommend trying to make a base this early in the game.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[jf]TR[fc]C[Sirkut> Protecting your pincered stone at F17 is very urgent.  If white plays D17, you're going to have a very difficult battle keeping white from having tremendous moyo.]

(;B[ln]C[Sirkut> High plays like this don't guarantee any territory for you, white would have to not put up a fight.  It's easier and safer to get points playing against the edges of the board.  White has not done much to protect his openning.  See a few of the variations on the last move.  Not to say this is a bad move, but it should be played later.]

;B[sd];W[sc];B[ms]C[Sirkut> The first thing thing that sticks out to me about this game  is that you let white take moyo but just suggesting that he might want it.  His positions were not strong, but you did not test them until quite late.

Secondly, you were very aggressive for being 4 stones weaker than your opponent and not taking a handycap.  Even in even games, it's important to protect the corners first, because it's easiest to get points there, then the sides, and then start pushing into the center.  This way you won't play half your moves thinking you have something only to watch you opponent easily beat you by just playing around your stones.

Thank you for submitting this game for review.  While it was obvious that you both felt rushed, you both played well.  I hope my comments are helpful.  Feel free to contact me by email if you have any questions about them.]
