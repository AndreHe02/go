C[Most
of my games are like this one , I won because of a mistake my opponent make
not a clean win . How should I play to become stronger

lordofpi [4k\]:
This is no standard review. I'm experimenting a little bit in this review.
I loaded the game on KGS and discussed it with a few other players.
lordofpi [4k\]: I hope that the review is still clear and not confusing and that it will help you a little bit.
lordofpi [4k\]: -- Gabriel


Thanks to: emkele, Tov, planar, Dmaeden and loial from KGS how helped me with the review.]

(;W[iq]LB[jp:B][dr:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: ok dmaeden what do you think about this move?

Dmadaen [14k\]: too low
Loial [14k\]: it seemed fine to me...
lordofpi [4k\]: yes i think it's possible

lordofpi
[4k\]: but more usual are the plays at 'A' or 'B' (var.) because here black
can make white overconcentrated (var. on next node)]
(;B[ck]LB[fc:C][fd:D][cf:B][pj:E][qn:F][eq:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: this looks bad
Loial [14k\]: yes
emkele [13k\]: why?
lordofpi [4k\]: i think it's too small
emkele [13k\]: ok yes of course

Loial [14k\]: yes, not so many options off of it
lordofpi [4k\]: it has no good follow-up moves
Loial [14k\]: i'd recommend putting pressure on d16
lordofpi [4k\]: recommend moves loial :)
Loial [14k\]: f17, f16

Loial [14k\]: maybe extension around q10
Loial [14k\]: if black wants a moyo game
lordofpi [4k\]: yes loial
lordofpi [4k\]: Q10 is an important point
lordofpi [4k\]: good extension from the top shimari (P17,R16)
lordofpi [4k\]: something else?
Loial [14k\]: well the e3 exchange seems good too
Loial [14k\]: keeps sente
lordofpi [4k\]: yes
lordofpi [4k\]: i'd also play the exchange right away

lordofpi [4k\]: see variations 'A'-'E' for other possible moves. 'F' is not so good.]
;W[cg]LB[pj:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: Q10 ('A') is an important point for both players. It is bigger than C13.]
;B[qn]C[lordofpi [4k\]: It's better to play at Q10 because of white's pincer we discussed in an earlier variation.]

(;W[np]LB[pj:C][pk:B][ql:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: White should play 'A', 'B' or 'C' instead.]

lordofpi [4k\]: :)
Dmadaen [14k\]: greedy!
lordofpi [4k\]: ok recommendations?
Loial [14k\]: odd shape, seems to have problems in the future
lordofpi [4k\]: yes

Dmadaen [14k\]: white will cut into pieces

(;W[pn]LB[pl:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: what about this?
Loial [14k\]: pointless
Loial [14k\]: q7 was to split
Loial [14k\]: q6 lets black connect and have better influence
lordofpi [4k\]: yes thats bad for white
lordofpi [4k\]: white has to continue and keep black seperated
Tov [14k\]: q8 ('A') better];B[pl]C[lordofpi [4k\]: Good! Nice point for black now.]

(;W[mm]LB[jd:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: N7 is small. K16 ('A') looks better.]

planar [5k\]: with white I'd invade at R12 I think.]
(;W[hd]LB[ph:C][qh:B][pi:A][mk:D]C[lordofpi [4k\]: this is too small. white has to do something against black's big moyo

lordofpi [4k\]: 'A', 'B' or 'C' are possible invasion points.
lordofpi [4k\]: 'D' shows a way to reduce blacks moyo.];B[jf]
C[lordofpi [4k\]: black is going for big moyo
lordofpi [4k\]: Q8 helps a lot now
lordofpi [4k\]: i think here played ok here]
(;W[hf]LB[mk:A]C[lordofpi [4k\]: white is just making it easier for black. H14 is small and C17 is still open for an invasion.

lordofpi [4k\]: yeah :)
planar [5k\]: I don't think K13 is good
lordofpi [4k\]: i guess this is too late for white]
(;B[mi]LB[li:A]C[planar [5k\]: white will contact for sabaki]
;W[li];B[lj];W[ki]C[lordofpi [4k\]: yep
lordofpi [4k\]: now white can run out
planar [5k\]: N12 maybe]
(;B[kh]C[planar [5k\]: L12 seems useless
lordofpi [4k\]: l12 is useless

planar [5k\]: N12 maybe];W[lh]C[emkele [13k\]: black has to stop white at any cost

lordofpi [4k\]: i like P13 somehow

planar [5k\]: maybe one more stone at P12 first
Loial [14k\]: p12]
(;B[kf]LB[og:A][nh:B][oh:C]C[planar [5k\]: L14 is even more useless than L12

lordofpi [4k\]: so L10 is useless
planar [5k\]: then black shouldn't try to get out
