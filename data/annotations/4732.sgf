C[M:  Both players made large overplays at various times in this game.  Your stones should work together; an overplay often results when a player has too many groups working independently.  
1)  Always try to keep your stones connected.  Only make two groups when one is very clearly secure.  Make it your goal to only have 1 weak group at a time (at most).  
2)  Foiling overplays requires reading.  Keep doing those life and death problems!

M:  At other times, both players were too submissive.  Try to always be on the attack.  Settle your groups by attacking a nearby weak group, for example.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc]LB[jc:C][cf:A][df:B][jp:D]C[M:  An approach from the other side works better with black's 4-4 stone (A or B).  If you want to disrupt white's top side, then C is normal.  If you want to build a moyo on the bottom, D (sanrensei) is normal.  

M:  I feel this move is played less often than A or B for two reasons.
1)  It invites white to play a good pincer.  White's pincer stone has support from the 4-4 stone in the top right, and the 4-4 stone in the top left is being used to build up influence (like it was meant to do).
2.   It does not help build black's formation.  This stone by itself does not work with black's bottom 4-4 stone.]

(;W[cf]C[M:  As white, I would pincer.]
(;B[id]LB[jc:B][jd:C][cf:A][df:D]C[M:  This is not standard.  White's A is a defensive move.  Black usually takes a share of the corner.

M:  If you want to extend along the side, B and C are often played if white has played D.]
;W[qj]LB[lc:A]C[M:  I probably would have played this stone at A, as J16 is oddly placed.]
;B[qf]C[M:  Black does white a favor again.  Why jump INTO a pincer?  Extend from the group on top or develop the bottom stones.  Black's stones are not working well together.]
;W[nd]LB[nc:A]C[M:  I'm of two minds about this move.  On one hand, the higher stone places more pressure on R14.  On the other, if white plays A, his corner group is more secure.  I'd probably play A here to keep black from making an extension from his left-side group.]
;B[lc]C[M:  Good.  Black now has a solid group and is threatening to undermine white's group.]
;W[qn]LB[pd:B][me:C][og:D][qj:A]C[M:  The stone at A is not in danger.  It still has three ways to extend.  The group that needs attention is at B, and it has a convenient weak group to attack.  Do so (C or D)!]
;B[nq];W[rp]LB[ql:A]C[M:  The weakness at A is quite real.]
;B[qq];W[qc]C[M:  This is very submissive.  Settle this group by attacking R14 more directly.]
;B[ql]
(;W[rl];B[qm];W[pm]LB[rm:A]C[M:  Ouch.  Always, always try to keep your stones connected.  A fully connected group is much easier to defend and handle than two separate groups.  Hence, white should play at A here.]

C[M:  Small.  Play elsewhere.];W[ok];B[of];W[cn];B[fq];W[bp]
;B[cq];W[cj]LB[ck:B][cl:A]C[M:  Again, too loose.  A is a real threat.  B is the normal move by white.]
;B[cl];W[dl]LB[en:A]C[M:  This move does not prevent black from getting out.  Play A (or something like it) to get into the center and isolate the black stone.]

[dc:A][jn:D]C[M:  It is very difficult to make territory in the center.  It is even harder when the opponent has many strong groups with access to the center.  

M:  In general, play corners first, then sides, then the center.  In this case, the top left corner is still open (A closes it without aji, B and C are also possible).  Another choice is to try to reduce black's bottom side (something like D?).]
;B[pi]LB[db:A][fe:B][ig:C][hj:D]C[M:  This area is small.  Black is trying to make something of the top left.  Black can reduce the corner or the center.]
