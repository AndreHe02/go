AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[houtzager: good gane

Hi there, thank you so much for taking the time to review my game, this game was played on Dragon Go Server over the course of about two months.  I think I got better towards the end.  It's my first large handicap game.

Mostly, I'm looking for tips on building territory and attacking.  But I also tend to leave myself needlessly vulnerable.

I'm also submitting this on the behalf of the other player, as I'm sure he would benefit from the review as well.  He's 26 kyu and I was 17 at the start of this game.

Why hello.  My name is Jeremy and I'll be reviewing your game.  I've been playing Go for two years now, and am currently about 8k.  I will try to answer your questions when I can, and hopefully add a thing or two for you to think about.]
PL[W];W[qf]C[Michael Reilly: hi there, hope I'm enough of a challenge for you. :)]
;B[qe]C[houtzager: certain of that. lets make it a good and enjoyable game]
;W[re];B[rd];W[rg]C[This sequence was a mistake on my part, this is my first large handicap game and I'm trying to get a hang of it.  My thought on a better move in this position is probably R11?  Where would you play?

That was a fine approach.  It is really hard to play high handicap games for this reason.  R11 would be a good move to build a base as well as undermine black's stone there.  You could also choose to escape at O14.]
;B[se]C[Mistake on black's part.  When ahead by 8 stones, play strickly defensive and let white attack you.  No need to attack white's stones, since they are already weak.  A move like N16 or 17 would grant you that whole corner, or Q14 or R11 would stop whites expansion.]
(;W[of]C[Play a little more aggresively here, like O14.  You have good shape in the corner there.   See variation.]
;B[rf]C[Still slow, think bigger.];W[pf];B[lf]C[Good.];W[ke]
C[This was just too inviting for me to turn down.  Was this a bad idea?

This is in fact the way to divide this shape.  However, dividing needs to have a purpose.  Dividing two stones doesn't do much.  However, dividing a  group that is unconditionally alive from a potentially dead one can win games.]
;B[le];W[je]C[I think I should have played at L16 instead.

I would play K14, but if you wanted to complete the divide L16 would do that.]
;B[kd];W[ie];B[id];W[hd]C[Re-reading this, a hane here isn't safe because this can turn into a cranes nest.

Good observation :-)  Very true, but see variation.]
(;B[fc]C[Good response, block the corner.];W[fe]C[Strong shape.]
;B[ee];W[gc]C[another mistake.

I don't see the mistake, besides potentially playing bigger.  I'll come back later if I see anything.]
;B[fd];W[ge];B[ef];W[cc]TR[fc][dd][fd][ee][ef]C[3-3 invasion too early.

It isn't too early, it's almost hopeless at this point with blacks thickness there.  This is really good shape, and with the support of the stone on the side is really really strong.]
(;B[dc]C[The play at D would've killed the stone.

I lied, check the variation.];W[cd];B[ce]C[Good shape black.]
;W[be];B[cf];W[bf];B[bg];W[pm]C[Good attack, pincering the black stone at Q10 against your strength.]
;B[ql];W[qm]
(;B[ri]C[Would a better move for black in this situation be R13?

Hmm.  You could use the aji there.  I was thinking more along the lines of Q11, because I don't like two knights moves.  Check the variations.]
;W[md]C[I think I should have just taken that cutting point?

The peep here was better.  Cutting points are other things that shouldn't be utilized just because.  Use it if it could kill the stones, but in this case black would respond N16 and the stone will be dead and black gets the corner.  This, hwoever, expands your group on the right and takes a good 9 potential points from black.  This would be the perfect time to cut the elephant's jump, though.]
(;B[ld];W[ne];B[nd];W[od];B[oc]C[Don't do this.  Giving up a ponnuki is bad news.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[oi]C[Good use of your new found influence to put pressure.]
;B[pi];W[qh]C[Unnecessary.  Both of you need to think big at all times.  Take away the big points.  The proverb goes "Play urgent moves before big moves", but that also entails play big moves before everything else if nothing is urgent.  This might earn you 1 point, as well as black's response, so white can try to block black from moving into the middle or attack a corner while black could defend another corner.]
;B[rh];W[sg];B[sh];W[rk]C[This move was to attempt to eliminate black's eyespace, is this the best move in this situation?

That would in fact do a good job of that.  However, black has a massive escape route that could be used anytime to make new eyes.  Plus, black could still make two eyes with this space with T10 if necessary.  It's good to try and forsee eye shape, but escape routes need to be eliminated first.]
;B[qk]C[With this, though, S8 could remove all eyespace so that black would get nothing.  See var.

Sorry, I keep forgetting to review black too.  I would try and escape here, since white might try and block you in.]
(;W[qi];B[rj];W[rl];B[oj];W[sk]C[I don't recall why I did this move before R10, or at all really, this is really awkard and dumb sorry :(

haha don't apologize.  I still do that.  Probably were thinking to take more eyespace, which it succeeds in doing.  Just not necessary.]
;B[sj];W[qj];B[nb]C[Think bigger.D7 would be huge.  Or G13.]
;W[mb];B[ob];W[oo]C[Looking back at this, I can tell I was thinking to grab control of the entire center, (it's what I wound up doing in the end too), but this play is way too big for black, where would you invade?

It's hard to invade black with so much support.  Your best option would be to contain and go for the middle, and if that's what you do great :-)    I would actually suggest N4 to contain better, but this works well.]
;B[op];W[po];B[ni];W[pk];B[oh];W[mg]C[Very good eye.  I was just thinking "black needs to move there", and I'm assuming that's what you thought too.]
;B[kg]C[Good containment, but you could do K13.];W[li];B[jh]
TR[oh][ni][pi][oj][pj]C[I would be worrying about your group right now. N9 could kill. (note for white too ;-))]
;W[jj];B[lb];W[lc]C[Michael Reilly: oooo! :D Starting a Ko will be fun in this situation.  Glad you thought of it.

Yeah, I don't know why I thought that. >_>;  Seems really dumb now.]
;B[ma]C[houtzager: ok, lets see];W[kb]C[should have played N17

Eh, go for the gold if you're going to play ko.  You could use any corner assault as a ko threat, and if black gives in you could get a lot of points elsewhere.]
;B[mc]C[houtzager: you are right this has many aspects and chances for us both.]
;W[cg]C[Michael Reilly: problem is, it's a rather large ko fight, so only large threats will do. :)]
;B[nd]C[houtzager: well lets see

This is the problem with that, white didn't have the shape to really pull it off.]
;W[df];B[de];W[nc];B[kc];W[dg]
(;B[gb]C[I'd say take the ko back, it's pretty big and might even kill white.  See var.]
;W[hb];B[fb];W[jb]C[Reminder to think big.];B[nd];W[np]C[Although here is where urgent before big comes into play ;-)]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[qp];B[qq];W[nc]C[so small.  I should have stopped bothering.]
;B[cb];W[bb];B[ca];W[ba];B[db];W[fg]C[d'oh.

Good, although leaves bad aji.  A general rule of thumb to follow is corners, sides, middle and potentially all before battles.  If a move in a battle will cost you less than a corner, take the corner.]
;B[eg];W[eh]C[Michael Reilly: hmm... it seems that my last move was ill thought out.  I apologize.]
(;B[nd]C[houtzager: no poit. we all make mistakes.its a gift when we learn from them.

See var to take advantage.];W[lq];B[kq];W[mr]C[M4 would be more sever and is better shape.]
;B[lr];W[oq];B[lp];W[pq]C[was this a good trade to make?
Eh, it's equal.  It does get you the corner though if you're careful.]
;B[nr];W[bh];B[bj]C[Good, but a little slow.  D7 wouldn't necessarily block white, but the worst white can do from that is B10, and that can be blocked as well losing a few points.]
;W[cl]C[DEEEEEP invasion, I'm surprised I got away with it.

Play futher from strentgh and closer to the weak stone.C7 I think would've been better.  If your group was stronger it would probably work better.]
;B[bl];W[bm];B[ck];W[dm];B[dl];W[cm];B[co]C[Good plays black.]
;W[el];B[dk];W[fm];B[bn]C[Unnecessary.];W[al];B[bk];W[fp]C[Very good white.  This would've been a better play for black instead of B6.]
;B[ep];W[eo]C[Good shape.];B[do];W[fn]C[And good influence.  Definitely setting up to take the middle.  Black, I would quickly think about moving in there to do some damage.]
;B[ak];W[am];B[ci]C[C12 would've been stronger.];W[fi];B[ch]
;W[ag]C[Michael Reilly: nice.  You almost had me, I nearly connected at d12, then I realized that if I did you could atari me at a12, forcing a13, then play a11, and I couldn't approach at b11 without first connecting at b13 (self-atari) so you'd have life.

I really thought I had that group dead too.  He managed to magick it to life later from this position.  I was impressed.  D12 forces B13, D11 forces F12, E10, life in gote.  I completely missed it, lol.]
(;B[an]C[houtzager: yes. had to try it];W[fr]C[You can do E3 here.]
;B[en];W[fo];B[dn];W[em];B[er];W[eq];B[dq];W[fq];B[es];W[cr]
C[Michael Reilly: This tetsuji looks problematic for black, but I haven't thought it all of the way through yet.

I really like this corner.  But I haven't played it all of the way through yet.  It's very seki.  And I normally can't even see seki.

So umm... Go problem.  Black to respond, can black fight this off without a loss of territory?

See my attempt in the variations.  Dunno if I missed something.]

This is perfect.  Black should've made a priority to protect this.  Think of it this way, if black played H2  that's about 6 points more that you just took away by moving there.  That's territory gained in my book.]
;B[jr];W[iq];B[ip];W[kp];B[jq];W[nc]C[hahahaa, I can't believe I'm still on that ko.

Rofl...  I'm laughing because I totally forgot about it and I can't believe it isn't resolved.  Your in the worse position there so it would be good to fill if you can.]

They're about even, and considering the score est. right now says W+115 I wouldn't worry about points.  I'm still not really at that point to really be able to see the single point differences between moves.]

(;B[ic]C[houtzager: just a blunder. do that now and then.

Seki still confuses me so don't worry.];W[hc]C[Michael Reilly: So like... I only see one 2-point yose move left on the board.  You have sente, are you going to take it this time?]
(;B[la]C[houtzager: yes. think its time to count 

See var for a better endgame move imo];W[ka]C[Michael Reilly: Better move would for you would have been L19.

My count for the score is W+131.5 at this point, but had you not suicided in the lower left corner it would have been W+94.5.  That's was a 37 point blunder. :(

Though it still impresses me how you made the mid-left group live.  If it's ok with you I'd like to submit this game to the Go Teaching Ladder.]

good game]N[B PASS];W[tt]C[Michael Reilly: It's part of xmp.net.  Same place that hosts Sensei's Library.  An excellent resource, you should check it out.]

Alright, so overall well played by both of you.  I hope I provided enough variations to give you a better idea of direction.  Black, the lesson I think you need to learn from this game is that territory isn't everything, that even though in general it is easier to get corners and more worthwhile, sometimes you need to sacrifice territory for influence as white did.  Practice some go problems and you'll be better in no time.

White, well played.  The lesson I would say you should take away is to play bigger.  Always think "Is this really urgent?  Can I sacrifice this one response to play bigger elsewhere?" and just try the next game or so you play to go out of your way and look for big plays.  It might make you lose a game or two at first by ignoring a move when you shouldn't have, but in the long run it's for the better.  

Also, I've noticed as I get better that learning in go isn't all about memorizing tesuji or key points, but instead changing the way you think about the game (like thinking bigger and not responding to every move).  I hope that the variations might help you see how I think about the game, and maybe you both can learn a thing or two from it.  I wish you both best of luck playing this amazing game and I hope you continue to enjoy it!  Feel free to contact me if you have any follow up questions about this review.  I also play on KGS as jemwest if you want to find me, if I'm online I'm willing to give teaching games if you'd like.
