AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Hi, this is a match I (white) have played against WinHonte (black) a computer program that usually throw me in trouble with 3 or more handicap stones.
I would apreciate some comment about my style of play and eventually on my big errors
Thanks
PS: I reported some comment with my name before... please add yours =)

Hi, I'm richard (rhi)  rhi: I'll do the same with my comments :)]
;W[pp]C[Matteo> Is this is the only one possible move ?
rhi:> well, as you may know, you also have the 3,4 points (as 'O'),
but those are calling black's attack;
so, your choice looks like the best one.];B[dj];W[qf]LB[nc:B]
[gd:C][qf:A]C[Matteo> I was in doubt between A,B and C

rhi > ... unfortunately, you're right to doubt,          ... as I also would ;)
I never know which one to choose: this is a question of "direction of play".
Simply, A is "cool", you look at exchanging territories, were as 'B' is attacking move.
I don't like the 'C' side (prefer keima approch) because white could be serverly attacked.
In conclusion, because you play white (stronger) you should choose 'B', attacking and complicating the game.]
;B[nc];W[gp]LB[fp:A][fq:B]C[rhi: I don't know about this approch:
why not 'A' or 'B'  more conventional ?];B[nq];W[lq]LB[gp:A]
C[rhi:> hm ... notice that this pincer is better when you have one more stone on the right edge.
But on the other hand, you prevent from a sever attack on A -> in this sense it is a good move.
but consider the variations: a black move on that edge isn't good for white ...]

(;B[dn];W[np]C[rhi: ... doesn't look like a good move:
never attach to the others stones unless your weak and he is strong.
Here, you will strengten him :(];B[mq];W[mp];B[fq];W[gq]C[rhi: ok, I would have played like that too]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[lr];W[kq];B[pr];W[kr];B[cf];W[ic]C[rhi: good, this allows you to extend on either sides when approched by black.
But ... I would have consolidated the lonely white stone on the upper right first ;)]

you strengten black for free:

;B[oj];W[ok];B[mh];W[kf];B[mm];W[kn]TR[mk][kl][mm]C[Matteo> I thought : The 3 marked stones are still very far from a live group so. I have to remove eye space.
rhi: My vision is   - you 'o' stones are not so strong: beware !
 - the black marked stones still have a big space to escape
 - all off this occurs in _you_ moyo
conclusion:
   - don't try to "kill" you will strenghten them
   - strenghten you own stones before attacking
   - negociate something in exchange with your lost moyo.

:-)
well, those are easy advices, ... how to do it practically ?]
;B[lg]C[this black move let's us defend how white stones, exactly what we wanted ;)]

(;W[kg];B[hd]C[Matteo> Ouch... I suffered this move a lot.... but how (and when) I could play there ?
rhi> now that your 3 stones look safe, go on attacking those black ones.
Don't let the machine guide your moves, and keep in mind your former ideas:
attack black 3 stones]
(;W[gb]C[rhi: this is unusefull I guess:
your stones aren't in danger, you needn't live right now.];B[fb]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[id];B[hb];W[ib];B[ga];W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[sk]
;W[si]C[Matteo> Very low space.... If black T14 as in sequence white is dead as I think ?
rhi: your right ...
      As I told you before, you had to add a (at least) move to live.
(T12 looks enough)]
(;B[gs];W[hs]C[rhi: how much this move while you know you have to make you white group live ?
I think you should let black enter here and save your group: the difference is in your favor.]

Black: 76 on the left side +

rhi: Very very good idea. The best you could have: counting should indeed guide your new strategy.]

Congratulations!
As you noticed it, black doesn't keep pressure long enough:
loosing those left-downer corner stones, and the middle ones.
This black middle group could have hurted far more.

Hower, I liked your way of playing.
Essentially, you try to get a reason to play your moves: this is a good way of playing.
Go on with this.

Perhaps could you invade more aggressivly sometimes.

Also, don't let your opponent guide the game: even if he plays else where, you sometimes have to had one move
(example this right edge group that he doesn't kill )


Ok, good luck for you next games, and feel free to contact me again if you had any other question.
