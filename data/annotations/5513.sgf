C[Hi. I've submitted this game for review because there's a lot of situations where I'm not sure if the moves I played were the right ones (and some where I know they weren't), and I need some comments on how to get the best out of those situations.

I played black.

- Kamber

[Migeru\] I think a big problem is that you play moves generally in the right area but without a real purpose, and that is not good enough. You also tend to play near strength, not away from it [there's even a proverb about this\]. Review the way white got away on the right side: you should have been able to kill that group.]
;B[pp];W[pd];B[cp];W[dd];B[qf];W[qd]
(;B[fc]C[[Migeru\] Black is tryng to maintain sente, but then gives it up at the next move. Maybe it would have been better to extend to R11 and let white decide where to go next?]
;W[dc]
(;B[ic];W[ld];B[qi]C[Figured with his two strong corner groups around, I'd better get good bases for my groups

[Migeru\] I think you need to make those bases in any case. The question is whether you should have played R11 earlier.]
;W[eq]C[[Migeru\] This defeats the purpose of Black not playing 3 at D4.]
;B[gq];W[eo]C[This corner sequence bothers me. I wanted to shut him in the corner, but it left me quite heavy.

[Migeru\] That may be because you attacked too aggressively, forcing your opponent to settle, instead of harassing them while building your position.]

(;B[hq];W[ir];B[mq];W[lr]C[I didn't see a reason to keep him from connecting those two groups, since they were both alive. Also, I wanted to get an extention from this wall before he extended from the upper left corner.

[Migeru\] Especially the forced move on the left seems unnecessary.]

(;B[cj]C[[Migeru\] This is two close to your own strength. See the alternatives.]

(;B[ef]C[This is another sequence I'm not so sure about. I think I could have played it more agressively. I ended up giving him a very large corner.
