C[erker: Dear reviewer!

In this game, I (White) felt that I am behind in the beginning so I invaded Black's upper moyo. The invasion turned out bad as my upper white group died. Due to a mistake by Black (Move 73), I captured the hole upper left corner, which I blundered away with Move 128.
In the end, I won by half a point. So either my perception that I am behind in the beginning was wrong or something strange happened in the endgame, which I am not aware of.

Please review for both sides. Thanks in advance.

MR: 
Hi Thomas,
for GTL publishing reasons I will do the review in English anyway. In case of any further questions you may contact me directly via eMail.

MR: My main feeling of the game is that both players should sharpen their "aji radar". Especially white tends to produce many weak groups and then tries to save every stone of every group - in Cologne one would say "Man muss och jünne künne."]

;B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[dg]C[MR: Business as usual until now ...]
;B[fd]C[MR: Many players would answer B E16.];W[dj];B[jp];W[qm]
;B[fq];W[dn];B[nq];W[pq];B[no];W[qj]C[MR: I think that this area is not very urgent. If black plays e.g. R9, white is more than happy to answer at P7. My suggestion would be to directly take measures in the top area of the board.]
;B[cq]C[MR: Taking the bottom left corner is much bigger than R10. However, entering the corner is nearly always gote for black. An alternative idea would be to extend the top area of influence around F/G13.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[br];W[bq];B[cr];W[qb]C[MR: This is a good move *if* you want to give the top area to black. However, if you still plan entering the top area, you should do this directly, as you might need other forcing moves from inside the top area (especially as due to W R10 black has no sente forcing sequence against the white group in the top right corner).]
;B[pb];W[kd];B[md]C[MR: Mild. Black seems to be satisfied with a very small area ( N to Q) and to allow white to jump away into the open.]
;W[kf]C[MR: Good.];B[if];W[ic]C[MR: Another idea would be to continue jumping away with L12.]
;B[jc];W[jd];B[jb]
(;W[ib]C[MR: This feels like overplay! Now white has two weak group in an area where black was anyway much stronger to begin with. Most likely, one of that groups should die!
There are, of course, very many variations - I just gave one possible continuation as alternative.]

;W[ki];B[kj];W[mi];B[pj]C[MR: A splitting attack is a good idea from black's point of view.]
;W[jg]C[MR: Aji keshi.];B[ig];W[lj];B[kk];W[pk]C[MR: Greedy, white is trying to get everything. My feeling is that white has to pay a price for living with his center group, and that this price could very well be that black captures R10. Local shape move for white would be N8.]
;B[ok];W[lk];B[ll]
(;W[pi]C[MR: Aji keshi. It could very well be that white needs the atari P10.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[qi];W[qk]
(;B[ni]C[MR: Does not work. Black should live with both groups separately.
Again there are many variations, see just two to get an idea of other possible developments of the game.]
;W[nj];B[nh];W[ol];B[nk];W[nl];B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[ml]C[MR: Lucky for white.]
;B[dl]C[MR: I share black's opinion that he has to take emergency measures to create turbulences in the game if he still wants to have a chance of winning.]
;W[ih]C[MR: White should care about the bottom part of his left side group, as the top part of the group is alive anyway due to capturing the top left corner. Capturing some aditional stones around H16 is small compared to capturing white stones around D4.]
