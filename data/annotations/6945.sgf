C[Sasscho [23k\]: same to you];W[cp];B[dc];W[pq];B[nc];W[dn]
LB[po:C][cn:B][dp:A]C[> This move is "backwards"; let me explain.  First, it is wiser (especially as a beginning player) to open at least one corner on the 4-4 points.  With your moves 2 and 4, you opened on 3-4 points, which makes it harder to enclose a large corner area. That immediately puts you at a disadvantage.  If you had played 2 at A and 6 at B, you would have a better shape because it's wider in the corner and narrower on the side.  This is what black did with moves 1 and 5 in the opposite corner (although I think black 5 would have been better at C to prevent your enclosing the lower-right corner).

You should study some basic joseki to achieve more equality in the openings and put this into practice.]
;B[jp];W[mp]LB[nq:D][pp:B][po:A][mq:C]C[>Again, a "backwards" move.  If you had played 4 at A or B and 8 at C or D, it would be much better.  Also, because of the bad shape made by your moves 2 and 6, please notice that black 7 threatens those two stones.  This is somewhat typical of 3-4 openings, and you played two of them.]
;B[eq];W[dq];B[gp];W[cd];B[fd]LB[cc:D][fq:B][ep:A]C[>I would consider playing at A to consolidate your lower left corner.  That is a sente move, meaning black has to respond (by playing at B, for example).  After black moves, then you can do something in the upper left corner.  Your move was all right but you could also have considered playing a D.  That supports the corner more, where your move supports the side.  Generally corners are more important because you can make larger territories with fewer stones in the corners.  Also, if you don't play at D, black should!]
;W[de];B[id]LB[cc:B][ep:A]C[>White should play at A (sente), then follow at B as previously described.  The left side may eventually become important (or maybe not!), but the corners are important now.]
;W[dh];B[dk];W[ck]C[At this point I thought I have a good chance to hold the whole left side.

>Let's reconsider that:
1. Left side isn't that important
2. You are leaving black the whole right side, because you haven't played there
3. Black can follow with additional stones near 17 either to start a fight or to reduce your left-side territory (variation).]

(;B[qg];W[qn];B[kr]C[A];W[lr];B[lq];W[mq];B[kq];W[fh]LB[mr:D]
[qj:C][cc:B][ep:A]C[>Your move 26 doesn't do enough now.  Pushing into the center is a good idea LATER, after you lay claim to corners and sides. Also, I still like moves A and B as commented earlier.  You could also play at C on the right side.  Please note that by playing at D black can capture your 22 stone, but doesn't need to do that now because he still has bigger threats.]
;B[bq];W[bp];B[dr];W[cq]LB[dp:B][ep:A]C[>A would still be better.  Then is black plays where you played 30, you can close at B.  Black will be safe in the lower left corner but only with small territory.]
;B[cl];W[dl];B[ek];W[el];B[fk];W[gk];B[fl];W[fm];B[gl];W[gm]
;B[hl]LB[em:B][cm:A]C[>It's important to play at A.  If you don't do this, black has a nasty cutting point at B.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[hn];B[em]C[>That's the cutting point I warned about.]
;W[dm]C[>Good.  That was a necessary defense.  Black's 31 stone is effectively isolated and dead.  White is slightly ahead.]

C[>Should have been at A, which is black's next and lethal move. Remember the proverb, "Opponent's best move is usually my best move."]
;B[ho]LB[cc:C][qk:B][qj:B][po:A]C[Have not seen this. At whicht stage could I have prevented it?

>First, protect the cutting point black used.  Also you created a vulnerability by skipping a point between moves 40 and 42, where a solid connection might have been safer.

Now black has a significant lead.  How is this possible?  Not simply because black captured some white stones.  More importantly, black can use his living area to push out into the center.

I think white now needs to strengthen the lower right corner (A) and play along the right side also (such as either B).  And don't forget the upper left (C).  If you think that's too many things to do at once, you're right.  Go can be like that when your situation deteriorates quickly.  It's important to prevent that.  Wise and cautious play has that objective.]

;W[oq];B[rr];W[ro];B[rp];W[so]C[I tried to prevent black fom forming a living group but...

>Don't worry about that too much; it's a small territory.  Your stones had "bad shape", which allowed black to make threatening moves like 67 and 69.  He then used this initiative to make eyespace for his own stones, which was smart.  You will not win every battle or stop every invasion; neither can he.]
;B[sp];W[or];B[ps];W[os];B[qs];W[rs]C[>Wasted move.  What did you expect black to do, other than capture? This kind of move is only useful as a ko threat.]
;B[ss]C[...I must have make a mistake, or haven't I?];W[ln]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[qo];W[qm]LB[rn:A]C[>Notice now that black can play at A and kill your 70-72 stones. That deprives you of the possibility to use them as a foundation for expanding upwards along the right side.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[qj];W[qi];B[ri]
(;W[pi]LB[pj:C][rh:B][qh:A]C[>Wrong direction.  I would recommend A.  Black would probably reply at B, then you play C, black D, etc.  See variation.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[pn];W[pm];B[qh]LB[oo:A]C[>Why did black do this instead of capturing at A???  Stupid!]

;B[jj];W[jg];B[oi];W[jl];B[kl];W[kk]LB[bb:A]C[I think that was not the best move, or?

>Absolutely not.  Playing in the corner would be better, for sure.   Black was able to capture some of your stones here because you didn't make solid connections.  You need to think about that.]

;B[qd];W[rc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[rd];W[qb]C[Here I get often conused how to best secure a living group.]
;B[oa];W[ko]LB[ra:A]C[>This is OK because it is sente (black must respond).  But immediately you should play at A to make life for the upper right corner where you invaded.]
;B[jo];W[kp]LB[bb:B][lp:A]C[>Playing 128 at A might be better.   But still you have B in the upper left corner, which is bigger.]
;B[ni];W[mh];B[nh];W[mg];B[ng];W[kj]MA[ok][nk][lj][nj][mj][mi]
[li]C[>This gives you a false sense of security.  The formation looks solid and you might think that all the X's represent potential white territory.  But black can extend from his 129 stone and wipe that out.  See variation.]

(;B[ke];W[jf];B[bb];W[ac];B[ed];W[dd];B[eb];W[bd]LB[ab:A]C[>You did not need to play here yet.  If black plays there, you can easily capture.   However, once black plays at A it is vital for you to play a white stone at 142.]

;B[cr];W[ap]LB[br:A][ra:B]C[>Better at A, because you would thereby make two eyespace points and reduce black's territory here.  Notice that after black's next move (at A) he makes territory along the bottom.  This is a difference of about 4 points: two points of territory you could have made plus two more that black did.

However, the upper right is STILL vulnerable and needs to be protected with B.]
;B[br];W[aq];B[er]LB[ar:A][ra:B][rm:C][fj:D][sd:E]C[>Black didn't have to do this, at least not yet.  You could gain one point here by playing at A.  This is a typical endgame move.

However, you are not at the endgame yet.  You can still save the upper right corner with B and make points on the side with C and deprive black with an eye with D, which is also a sente move.

AFTER you play B, you can think about playing E.  But if you do that now, black will kill the upper right corner by playing at B himself.  Remember the proverb, "Opponent's move is usually my best move."]

[mo][oo][np][nq]C[>No further comments on the game.  In general I would recommend the following to help your playing:

1. Play openings on 4-4 points and pay more attention to your shape.  Learn a few basic joseki.

2. Be alert to urgent moves, like where you finally played 224 to secure the upper right corner.  If black were alert, he could have killed this corner as early as move 125!!!

3. As the endgame nears, pay attention to little moves that can gain you a point here and there.  Examples are 241, where black lost a point, and 244, where by allowing black to play 245 you lost a point.

I would also recommend you play some computer games.  Playing on a 9 x 9 board is very helpful for beginners to sharpen their tactics.  I like the program called Many Faces of Go.  If you don't have a program, you can play Gnu Go on line at http://eidogo.com/#1qOalTCs.]
