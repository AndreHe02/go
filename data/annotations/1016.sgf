;B[pd]C[bink: During the game the lead changed at least twice due to
big errors. These errors overshadowed the rest of the game]
;W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qn];W[de];B[jc];W[kp];B[cj];W[ch];B[cn]
;W[fq];B[bp];W[bq];B[co]C[bink: B5 would be better. It also threatens C3 next, so White has to
defend, but Blacks Position is then stronger];W[dp]C[bink: Now there are three importent points: Around G17, around Q10
and around N3. All of them are Gote for Black.
I would play G17 here. If Black is allowed to play H17
Black gets a very good, very big corner. And moreover White H17 puts
pressure on  K17, so it would probably be sente to. (If white plays O3
its not sente). The way Black played in the game, Black gave the more
important points H17 and R11 both to White];B[mq];W[lq];B[mp]
;W[qi];B[qg];W[ql];B[om];W[oi];B[og];W[hc]C[bink: The game still looks pretty even]
;B[nc]C[bink: K15 is much stronger. At this stage of the game
influence is still more important then safe territory. K15 is on the
borderline between the two moyos];W[rm];B[rn];W[ie];B[je];W[if]
;B[ej];W[dk]C[bink: This is an overplay by White. Black should connect at D10 and
put pressure on the weak white Stone. See variation]
(;B[ck]C[bink: This is going to much for safe territorry at the border. White
gets the advatage in the center.];W[dj];B[di]C[bink: An overplay by Black. Blacks stones are now not strong enough
to put pressure on White. Black shoud now stick out his head at D8,
let White play D11, and consider the stone E10 as light.];W[ci]
;B[dl];W[ek];B[fk];W[el];B[fi]C[bink: This does not work. Black is in deep trouble. White could
directly play C8 (if Black D7, the white B9 captures 2 stones, and
leaves Black with two weak groups). White G10 first is also strong]
;W[gj];B[fl];W[em];B[fj];W[eh]C[bink: White C8 looks even more convincing. Now Black can at least
secure the group on the boarder of the board.];B[dm];W[ei]C[bink: All white groups are strong. Black has a very weak, big
group. So: White clearly got the lead];B[fh];W[gn];B[hl];W[jf]
;B[ke];W[ln];B[eg];W[dh];B[en]C[bink: White should certainly play F7 now: Put more pressure on the
weak black group, and keep his stones connected];W[do]C[bink: A mistake by White. Black should play F7 before playing
D6 and seperate the white stones. But even after that, Blacks position
would still be difficult.];B[dn];W[bl];B[cl];W[fm];B[bm];W[bo]
C[bink: Now White is generous to Black. Instead of playing a small
endgame sequence with B5 White should rather attack the weak black group
with a move around K10, Blacks group has hardly any chance to survive,
and even if it survives, White will have the lead];B[bn];W[ap]
;B[ii];W[ki];B[kf];W[jh];B[mi]C[bink: It looks to me, as if Black has given up the hope to rescue
the weak group, and is instead using the aji of the group from outside.]
;W[kk]C[bink: Now I dont see any chance for the black group anymore, if
white plays correctly];B[hm];W[fg]C[bink: That move is bad. White should rather attack the whole group
instead of seperating a single stone.];B[gg]C[bink: Good! Black is using the chance, White gives him]
;W[ff];B[hg];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi];B[hk];W[ih];B[gi];W[hh];B[gh]
C[bink: After G5 the black group would still be under bigger
pressure then in the game. White
now plays the bad move G7. He seems afraid of Black G7 White G9 Black
F6. See the variation. Please note also, that White is afraid of
essentially the cut, which Black could have done for free at moves 61
or 63]
(;W[gm];B[jm];W[io];B[kl];W[ll];B[ik];W[jj];B[jk]C[bink: Good! Black made his second eye, and the central group is
alive. I think White still has the lead, but Black is back into the
game, as Black got a weak group to attack now];W[km];B[jl];W[jn]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[nj];W[rh];B[rg];W[ph]C[bink: A bad mistake by White. White should rather safe this group
with S10. After S10 the game would be pretty close. Black has got a
big corner now.];B[rj]C[bink: Good! I dont see how White can defend this group now]
;W[qj]C[bink: Black should now play S9. After that there are two options to
connect the black stone: S11 or S8. White cannot prevent both. That
means the White group has no chances for two eyes];B[ri]C[bink: not so good. It might still be good enough, to kill the white
group. But it is more complicated now.];W[rk];B[qh];W[sj];B[sh]
;W[pk];B[oj]C[bink: Good.];W[pj]C[bink: This is an important situation, please look at it
carefully. You will see:
There are two possibilities for an eye for White: One at the border,
and one at R9. For both those eyes White needs one more move. So Black
can treat them as a miai: If White makes the necessary move for the
one eye, Black destroyes the other one.   If Black would do nothing now, there
is the additional danger, that White threatens to connect to the
outside (via P8 or P9).  
The conclusion is: Black should just stop the possible connection. And
destroy the eye later. If it would be Whites move now, the best move
would be P8. That is also Blacks best move. White is dead after Black P8.
If White Q8, so Black T8. If White T8 so Black Q8. If White Q7, Black
Q6 or P6(the miai remains). If White P9 Black N9];B[sl]C[bink: Playing one of the two points of a miai is usually not
so urgent];W[ol];B[lk];W[kj];B[ml];W[lm];B[nh];W[sm];B[sk];W[nm]
;B[on];W[rl];B[nl];W[sk];B[gf]C[bink: The following moves by Black are very strong! White does not
seem to realize, that now Whites central group is in danger of dying]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[gd];B[ib]C[bink: Does Black hope here, that White does not see the cut at J16?
White should certainly play something like J16 now and should not
answer the J18 move. Black is playing with the fire in assuming that
White will answer at H18];W[hb];B[fd]C[bink: This is clever. But the simple move J16 would have the same
effect: Whites group gets cut off];W[ed];B[hd];W[gc];B[id];W[mk]
;B[ok]C[bink: A very good move! White has to give one of the groups. Blacks
lead is big now. There are only endgame moves left, so Black should win]
;W[pl];B[lj];W[mm];B[lh];W[li];B[mj];W[nk];B[oh]C[bink: This is certainly not the biggest endgame move and here was no
real danger for Black. But Blacks lead is big enough for such moves]
;W[no]C[bink: Unfortunately Black will make some weak moves now, and give
away the corner. Black should play P4 now. Then the whole group would
be stable. This type of diagonal move is often the right move to stop
an attacker coming from outside];B[oo];W[np]C[bink: Again: P3 would safe everything]
;B[nq];W[op];B[pp];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[nr];W[qr]C[bink: Black could still play S3 and win the capturing race easily]
;B[lr];W[kr];B[ms];W[qp]C[bink: White has now taken away the corner -even in sente- and White
will win now.];B[rq];W[qq];B[qo];W[rp];B[os];W[ks];B[lp];W[kq]
;B[ls];W[po]C[bink: This was ot really necessary, as White has two options to
connect (the second one being T6). But being well ahead  White can easily afford such a move]
