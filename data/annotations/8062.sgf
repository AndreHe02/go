C[I analysed it myself for a while, think I got the worst mistakes figured out, but of course I would appreciate some suggestions from some higher level players.]

;B[hc]LB[nc:A]C[slight variation to chinese opening. more focus on the territory at upper left corner. however leaves the A area more space.]
;W[qf]
(;B[dj];W[nc]C[Because black tenuki, of course white will punish black with double pincer.]
;B[oe]LB[nd:A][pf:B]C[This is simpliest response to double approach. There is also A or B.]
;W[qc];B[md]LB[pc:A][qd:B]C[Till here w is following my plan


Locally speaking I think black should tenuki, It is unsure what Black can gain . maybe black should leave this alone so perhaps later on black can choose A or B]
(;W[pc]LB[mc:B][qd:A]C[A or B?

R16 normally not played (by pro's that is...) but now should I play A or B?]
(;B[mc]LB[ob:A][qd:B]C[correct side to block. If white tenuki later on there is big end game at A as well perhaps black can block at B later on. so comparison to the joseki. White is not satisfy.]
;W[nb];B[lf]LB[qd:A][pg:B][oh:C]C[think B still good here

although this is shape point, but I think because black still have A therefore black could try to fix the cutting point by playing something like B or C. both point offer black much better expansion in the middle.]

(;W[he];B[jd];W[cl]LB[bj:C][cm:B][cn:A]C[this is over play. white play A or B both move allows white to invade at C later on. however this move allows black's option to invade at A especially black is very strong on the left side.]
;B[jq]LB[cn:A]C[not sure here if this is best

I am not sure either. there are many way to play. I would focus on setting up invasion at A]
(;W[mq]LB[lq:A]C[this is slightly awkward for white white should have play A to keep tight pressure on black.]
(;B[gq];W[eq]LB[lq:A]SQ[mq]C[This is also ok for black as black not get sente to play elsewhere. also because white marked stone is not at A so black's two stone is slightly more comfortable.]

I think this is very strong move]
