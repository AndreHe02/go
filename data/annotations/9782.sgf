RE[W+8.5]
RU[Japanese]

C[Thank you for the chance to review this game.  I tend to be much more aggressive, so this was a good lesson for me in distant peaceful play.

Reviewing for the white side.  White ends with +8.5

black allowed peep at m14
black gave up r14

note: use shift + click in CGoban to jump to the move

Questions from white: R14 D8 J3

13: R14 : work with lower stones to build up side area
21: R16 : white can lean into the black corner and build up a supporting wall.
22: P14 : black needs to avoid leaning into a group making it stronger.
28: N13 : black double hane is critical mistake
29: M13 : use sente to block the corner group from expanding
31: M15 : moving to center is better after securing edges
38: L14 : black must respond to the peep
51: R2 : when groups are strong extend more
57: S16 : extend to take profit and reduce
73: K6 : avoid forcing opponent to connect
99: L15 : use tigers mouth to connect and attack and enter top center
105: E14 : connect indirectly to support two stones at once.
108: E12 : attack rather than defending a stong place
113: G9 : sacrifice a stone and protect the center
125: K15 : defend while keeping attack point strong

In general try to play some games where you win by just 5 or 10 points.  It can be painful to give up large bits of territory, and patiently wait for opportunities.

I did not see any stone sacrifices.  Try throwing in some stones just beyond where you hope to control, then sacrifice the stone, using it to defend or attack.

N: hello this is the review of the review.
As this is my first review of a review, I hope to do this right and I'll try to follow the priciples I try to follow when reviewing a game myself:
* Limmit comments, stick to the most important lessons from the game.
* Do not always try to find the exact solution in a certain position (as reviewer) as this can get very time consuming and possibly wrong; Instead share your thougts on the position.
* also point out good moves.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have further questions
My review reviews are preceded by 'N:'

Kind regards,

;W[qn];B[om];W[pl];B[dj]C[N: can't help to add a coment here: the lower right is the hotspot of the game, and suddenly black plays elsewhere. In similar shapes, black tries to build a wall to attack the single white stone. If white gets strong on both sides, black just has a floating group.]

(;W[ol]C[N: yes, I like this move]
(;B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[fc];B[dc];W[jd];B[mc]
(;W[qf]LB[qd:A][of:B][fq:C]TR[ol]C[Question from white player:
Im not sure about letting him grab a huge corner by playing this approach. Though it ended up leading to my biggest territory in the game, I wonder if it was a good move.

Response:
That is an interesting question, is this a good trade for white, to help black solidify the corner, while white takes the area on the side.

With P8 and Q8 as support something around Q14 feels important.

Another question is... why wait until now to play this stone?

I think black made a mistake with the R16 reply
A: R16: black makes a more solid corner, inviting white to take P14
B: P14 : black aims to jump into the Q12 area while getting out of the corner.
C: F3 : black leans into the corner, planning to play at J3, putting pressure on M4

N:in this shape, A is a normal move. If the following result seems too good for white, this is because black allowed white to play the key move (triangled) p8. So the mistake was earlier and not here in my opinion.
The white approach seems also fine, exacly because of p8. See the variation for an alternative at A.
I'm not so convinced by the alternatives black responses at B & C.]

(;B[qd]LB[oe:B][of:A]C[A> game move extends R14 to grow the territory,
however this may be too open, inviting black to jump in

B> suggested move leans into black in the corner while building up a stronger R14.
The trade of a solid wall from nothing is worth pushing stones into the corner which is mostly alive.

N: A seems fine and logic to me. It also is more solid.]
(;W[of]LB[me:C][ne:A][re:D][mf:B]C[A> game move has black leaning into P14 to build up the corner
B> possible move separates P14 from K16
C> suggested move extends black and separates K16 from P14, looking to jump into H17

Move A has the side effect of forcing white to take a very sold right side.
Move B looks to be too far with P16 so open.

N: see variation after C
A does not feel to great, but is understandable from the black players perspective.
Very important to note here is the extremely important 6 point double sente at D. I think black might want to play this right away.]

(;B[ne]C[a gift from black, forcing the wall to get stronger.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[oe];B[nd];W[mg]LB[lf:B][lg:A]C[A: M13: game move : double diagonal invites white to cut at B14 and connect with K16
B: M14: suggested move : make a more solid N14 support];B[lg]
LB[lf:B][mh:A]C[
A> game move gives support to N13
B> suggested move uses sente on N14 atari to cut M13 from O15

This is a risky move, but with support at R14 and Q8 I would do it.

N: not too important I think, but I would play B here.]
(;W[mh];B[le]LB[kc:D][fe:E][if:A][kf:F][cl:C][fq:B]C[A> J14 : game move : extends group to center and separates black groups
B> F3 : suggested move : strengthen the corner to work with N3
C> C8 : suggested move : extend corner and put pressure on side black stone
D> L17 : suggested move : secure territory on top

N: the white stones at the top are now lonely and should be afraid of the black wall, I would play E and would later peep at F to reinforce.]

(;W[if];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc];W[gd];B[fb];W[kf]LB[lf:B][cn:A]C[A> Game move C6 extends black on the side
B> Suggested move M14 gets black into the center

B joins the two white groups, taking away any worries about the floating white group, turning a weak group that will fall under attack into a huge fighting weapon.

N: rewiew is done for the white side, so I would focus moslty on that]

(;B[cn]LB[ch:B][dl:A]C[A: D8 : game move : attack group directly
B: C12 : suggested move : divide side up into two parts

This is connected with the player question on move 46, where the territory on the upper left was large.

Giving up territory to the opponent can be painful, hopefully we can grab just a bit more in each exchange.

N: i would simply defend the hoshi stone.]
(;W[dl]LB[lf:D][dk:B][cl:A][dm:C]C[Question from white player:
I am also not sure about this move.

Reply:
It may need some development of M5 and C16 first
The risk of not taking M14 is big.

This feels like white and black are playing an exciting dare game by not taking the obvious point at M14

N: locally this is almost always a bad move, as black can simply connect his stones (see variation). The possible good moves are in a 'V' shape A, B, C, Possibly this is the most important that white can learn from this game.
Whole board however, there still is the situation in the lower right where white should be able to get profit from putting pressure on these stones.
As for D: I think white can risk to keep this as a kind of miai between cutting and running away.]

(;B[en];W[fp]
(;B[bp];W[cq]LB[fe:C][lf:B][cl:A]C[A: C8 : game move cuts off D10 from C6, feels like too many stones around D8 considering how early this is in the game.
B: M14 : suggested move, connect M13 stone and enter the center
C: F15 : peep to keep H16 out of E14 area]
(;B[cl]
(;W[iq]C[Question from white player:

This one as well. though it lets me stableize my territory it gives a lot to him on the upper left.
Is there a way I could have avoided such an exchange? (either now or maybe several moves before. )

Reply from reviewer:

exchanges like this are good for the game, you get support for your M4 stones and he gets something to attack J14 with.

black did take D13, but white got M14, which made J14 so strong it cannot be attacked.

the D8 move did force black to get thicker on the side.  attacking around C2 would help separate

N: this is a very safe move, normally you play this if you counted that you are well ahead. Now it feels soft because black is still weak in the lower right, so it seems you have to put pressure on black and then make territory by attacking.]

(;B[dg];W[lf];B[lo]C[N: whow, a big thank you move now white has territory (would still have been better if white played here first).]
;W[kp];B[qr]LB[fg:C][lj:A][ll:B]C[A: game move : take territory in center and side
B: suggested move : take a bit more territory, L4 and P8 are strong supportoC: suggested move : take territory on the side, while looking to threaten with E11

N: A feels a bit soft
   B: ok
   C: kind of close to thickness]
(;W[lj];B[gj];W[ee];B[de];W[re]C[N: finally, black playing here would have meant a 6 point difference and a very close game. Another important one to remember if two quite big territories are next to eachother.]
;B[rd]LB[fg:B][gl:A]C[A: G8 : game move : threaten to rescue D8 while threatening to extend G6 or M10
B: F13 : suggested move : reduce black's ability to extend from D13

I consider G8 no mans land and would focus on the G3 area, or the K8 space.]

(;W[gl];B[gn];W[il];B[nr];W[mr];B[nq];W[ii];B[fd];W[fe]C[awesome, a stone is sacrificed to keep sente.

I feel like white has enough support locally to capture the stones.
the game move of J5 forces black to connect in exchange for not much I think.

N: I think white can cut
