AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am pto from Finland.
My commenting style is that I don't show variations. You need to find it out yourself. But I do give hints on what is the direction where the variation should go. You are the one who need to do the real job in the end.

I try to keep relaxed attitude toward go and it shows in these comments too. As a Finn I tend to say things straight out which sometimes may give impression that I am impolite or something. That is never the case.

Handicap go is difficult to comment. White is forced to play agressively and black has temptation to play safe. Key point is that black has huge influence that he must use to make teritory. White on the other hand need to negate this influence while making his teritory. As allways balance between these is decisive factor.]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[ce];B[df]LB[fd:1][dj:2]C[This exchange is not good for white. If continued with 1 and 2 will white have serius difficulties ahead in lower side.

Without 1 white corner is thin. Without 2 black has to play defencively in lower left.]
;W[nc];B[qf]LB[pf:A]C[White propably hoped this exchange to happen. A might be better for black for future development in lower side.]
;W[gd]LB[fc:B][fd:A]C[I usually suggest to to play this move. It is only marginally better in than A or B in terms of territory but it gives much more opportunities for black. Pretty much every time I'we seen this move, it has failed in some part of the game.]
;B[ld]LB[dj:A]C[Move around A is vital for black.
It would allow white to play one extra move at upper side, but that is no wory for black. White would be overconcentrated and would still need at least one move to eliminate black invasion.]
;W[ne];B[id];W[qn];B[nq];W[qk];B[qi]LB[pb:1][qi:2][dj:3]C[This black stone is slow. Black upper right corner is pretty strong because black can choose between 1 and 2.]
;W[cn]C[Now it is too late. Black will fall into defensive position.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cj]C[Black took the vital spot, but this should have happened before white plays here. Now black is one move behind in critical strugle.

Now short review what is going on. White has four weak groups and one pretty stable. Black has one weak group at upper side and weakness at lower left. Both of these groups have weak white groups nearby so no danger.]
;W[cq]LB[cp:2][dq:1]TR[cn][hq]C[Black should be happy to give away this corner for a wall. Whatever black chooses to do, one white stone will connect to living group and the other will have a lot aji.]
;B[cp];W[bp]LB[bo:1]TR[cn]C[Playing at 1 would seal white in leaving marked white stone weak. White on the other hand will propably link his weak stone underneath. Black has then one large side and white gets one large corner.]
;B[dq];W[bq]C[Situation at lower left: white has a living group and one weak stone that has room to move. Black has one weak group. Black will not be able to create territory around this quarter of goban unles he can capture.]
;B[jq];W[ho]LB[lq:1][qq:2]C[This exchange favours white as now black is under heavy attack and white has interesting combinations in reserve.]
;B[co];W[bn]TR[cn]C[Result of this exchange was that marked white stone became a lot stronger.]
;B[jo];W[eo]LB[lp:2][qq:1]C[This exchange gave black some security at lower right but was painful for black lower left. White has still moves in the right for the future.]
;B[bo];W[ao]C[Black took away one liberty from himself and reduced white eyespace. White will propably live anyway so his was good for white.]
;B[dn];W[do]C[This exchange feels weird. It helps black to escape but this kind of cut can not be good deal for black. Anything else.]
;B[dm];W[bl];B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[gr];B[fo];W[en];B[fn];W[em]
;B[fm];W[dl];B[ep];W[cm]LB[in:1]TR[nc][ne][qk][qn][ho][hq][gr]
C[And here happened just about the last thing white could wish. Black thickness is crushing. And white has weak groups all over the board.

Guide for situations like this is: don't try to capture (if you have any doubs of success), just tease those groups and force them to run. Black 1 has some fatality in it though.]
;B[hm];W[in]LB[in:1]C[This split was so obious and strong that black should have prevented it. Black should have played here himself.]
;B[jn];W[im];B[hn];W[io];B[jm]LB[hl:1]TR[nc][ne][qk][qn]C[This black move could have been at 1. One nice technique agains running groups is to force two groups close and then - just in the last moment - cut them apart. That hurts both of those groups. Now marked white groups are not seriously affected as distance between them is large.]
;W[il];B[rp]TR[qk][qn]C[Black had momentum but this move loses it. Now white can start controlling the game.

It is true that marked white stones are allmost dead, but they can still run and make more eyes.

Most of all, white has big fishes to catch. Center of board is important.]
;W[gp];B[fp]LB[er:1]C[What happens when white playes 1?];W[ch]
;B[dh];W[bh]LB[id:1][ne:B][dh:2][qk:C][il:A][fm:3]TR[gf][fk]
C[Nice moves for white, lets stop for a brief situation analysis.

Black has three weak groups and so has white. Trouble is that black weak groups are closer to each other. This means that white moves around marked areas attack two of these groups.]
;B[bf];W[bj];B[di];W[fl];B[gl];W[fk];B[hl];W[dg]TR[hf][if][jf]
[gg][hg][ig][jg][kg][gh][hh][ih][jh][kh][gi][hi][ii][ji][ki]
[hj][ij][jj]C[Here white plays in small scale. Large scale attack in the danger zone would seriously hurt all three weak black groups and help all the weak white groups.]
;B[bc]LB[cc:1][fc:2]TR[bf][cf][df][dh][di][cj]C[Spirit of this move is not to connect but to live in the corner. It would ppractically sacrifice marked black stoned which would be too much. Rather black should now run and keep 1 and 2 in reserve, he could later use those moves in counter attack. But now it is time to run.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[ae];B[eg];W[cg];B[ec];W[dc];B[ed];W[cb];B[gc]
TR[nc][ne]C[Here white played submissively good result for black. Now marked white stones are in imminent danger. Danger zone begins to favor black.]
;W[lb];B[pb];W[jc]TR[hf][if][jf][gg][hg][ig][jg][kg][gh][hh]
[ih][jh][kh][gi][hi][ii][ji][ki][hj][ij][jj]SQ[pb]C[But now black strength has turned into weak shape. Marked black stone made large amount of territory but made this to happen.

Dangerzone is still important - who will control it?];B[jd]
;W[kc];B[md];W[nd]LB[rl:2][rm:3][on:1]TR[qk][qn]C[Situation: Black is strong on the right side and weak on the left. Marked white stones are wulnerable, someone might even say dead. Black 1 would make teritory in sente,  2 and 3 might be killing moves. White on the other hand can make nasty things on upper left side.]
;B[jl];W[ik]LB[er:1]C[This exchange hurts the black groups a lot.Now would be good time to prevent white 1]
;B[ii]C[Black took the danger zone but...];W[hk]LB[gk:2][er:1]
C[...now black is sealed in. And when big group is sealed the first concern should be to get two eyes. Bad thing is that white is allmost connected. If black now plays elsewhere, white 1 is allmost fatal. If white starts with 2 black will prorably live but white has sente and strength for attack.]

[mg][kh][lh][mh][nh][ki][li][mi][ni][oi][lj][mj][nj][oj][mk]
[nk]C[Suddenly black weaknes in upper side has become strength. Black has total control on this area and it can be no longer be called as danger zone.

Next dangerzone (in global sense) is somewhere around marked area.

Situation:
Black has one dying groups that is sealed in but all the rest of his groups are safe and large.

White has one dying group and one potentially dying group.]

;W[mg];B[lh]LB[mf:1]TR[qk][qn]C[White took important cut and is now able to start his rescue operation for marked stones. Black 1 could have enabled black to make wall toward the marked stones.]
;W[ok]C[Now white took control of the second danger zone. He will propably live or connect.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[gn]LB[fj:1][jj:2][go:A][er:3]C[If black had played A he would have biggery eye and better fight for life. White should either connect or go for capture.]

;W[ni];B[ml];W[ki];B[li];W[kg];B[jg];W[kh];B[if];W[qc]LB[rg:2]
[rh:1]C[So little life and death for a while. Key thing here is that white tries to use all aji he has around. Moves like 1 and 2 might have been better.]

;B[pg];W[re];B[oe]LB[rb:1][sf:2]C[Black 1 would increase difficulty for whites life and death problem. Or how about 2?]
;W[sg];B[qg];W[rb];B[ri]LB[ra:1][rj:2]C[1 Would still give white difficult problem, he could try to connect with a ko at 2.]
;W[ra]C[White is alive.];B[sf];W[sd];B[rc];W[rd];B[sh];W[lr]
LB[fj:A][er:B]C[Here is the same thing like in upper right corner. White plain is to chain togather as many things as possible. And then try to make something out of it.

Please note A and B.];B[jr];W[po];B[oo];W[nm]LB[pl:2][pm:1]
TR[lr]SQ[qn][po]C[This is painful, but it was hanging in the air. Go back to see where and how it formed.

Black has strength so counter attack might work. Kosumi at 1 threatens to attack marked white stones and push at 2 continues the idea. Study variations yourself. I think black will be well of.]
;B[nl];W[om];B[ol];W[pl]C[Black has lost valuable attack.];B[pn]

;W[pq];B[np];W[pr];B[mf]C[Cutting this white chain is surprisingly difficult.]
;W[me];B[nf];W[of];B[pf];W[ng];B[og]C[This move gave black nothing. This is tight situation, there is no time for this.]
;W[lp];B[pj];W[ns]LB[ms:1][os:2]C[White at 1 or 2 would have been so called monkey jump. It canot be cut.

You can cut this...];B[nr]C[...but not with this. Try to find the cut.]
;W[os];B[mr];W[ms];B[kr];W[lq]TR[pj]C[What happened? Black has just lost huge amount of points. One wasted move did it all.]

;B[je];W[fb];B[fc];W[eb]LB[cd:B][ks:A]C[White lost sente, so this can not be good for white. This was even small.

First move for black is one point sente at A. Second is huge gote at B.]

;W[fa];B[da];W[ca];B[hr]C[This would have been big move for white. Even if it canot capture black group, it would force black to remove this huge white group which would cost a lof of points.

And it would be hasty to say that black is not dead (assuming this had been white). Try to find out how the capture race would end.]

C[Wrong move from white, now black can make seki with two throw ins, one cut, one six stone sacrifice and one stone in the vital point of the so called rabbitty six shape.

Find the moves, and don't give up until you do find it. This is delicous.]

[iq][fr][gr][ds][es][fs][gs][hs][is][js]C[The verdict:

White concentrated too much on territory and did not try to negate black influence in beginning. White managed to punnish black from his mistakes well.

Black had good spirit and was leading from beginning to end. Victory was not in stake because white could not challenge blacks strategy. Biggest troubles black had in complicated corner situations.

Both players are sentenced to play more for lost opportunities.
For white concentration should be ballance between teritory and influence. Professional games are good for this.

For black concentration should be life and death so he can punish opponent from overplays better and to make better situation analysis. Go to the goproblems.com to get started.

This game was great! I could feel the fighting spirit in every move. If I just could have followed this while you were playing.

Good luck for the future.])
