C[Dear Reviewer, thanks in advance for the review. This my second league in the second season of the German internet go league, league 2. I intend to submit all my league games to the GTL.

I lost the game by 9 Points including komi. I surrounded a group of my opponent in the opening, building lots of influence, but i didnt manage to use that influence well enough. I would especially appreciate tips on how to use that influence properly, which seems to be one of my main problems, not just in this game. Feel free to comment other crucial points of the game, though.

I removed all conversation from the SGF file since it is in German and would only distract from the game.

;W[dq];B[oc];W[qj];B[cf];W[cd]C[Maybe a pincer would be better?

;W[ic];B[id];W[jc];B[jd];W[hc];B[rp]C[JH : This 27 looks big.]
;W[gf]C[JH : Looks good];B[kc];W[ej]C[The Attack on blacks small group is the part of the game which interests me most.

Is it better to play the b12/b13 area first?

JH : By playing 30, White will build influence but Black is solid on the lower side and it will be difficult to use it. I think White B12 would be usual.
Till now the game seems equal but now, because of 30, Black is better]
;B[be];W[fh]C[Are there more severe options during the following moves?]
;B[bk];W[cl];B[cj];W[ip]LB[ql:a]C[This sequence on the lower side turned out to be not good enough. Please show me some good alternatives. Maybe an Invasion at M3 or N4 would be better?

JH : My preference would be N4 : if Black protects his terrtory then White will be strong in the center and protect the weakness at "a"]
;B[iq];W[gp];B[fr];W[fp];B[jn]C[I think this move by black was very good, I didnt know how to deal with it. I felt like i was losing from here onwards.

JH : I agree with you Black 41 is good];W[jo];B[ko]C[42 : This strategy for white is not so good as the territory in the center is too small.]
;W[in];B[kn];W[im];B[ql];W[kl];B[jj]LB[pm:a]C[B49 instead of this move, i would play "a" which gives no chance for White 12]
;W[lj];B[jh];W[pm]C[52 : Good];B[rn];W[rm]LB[pl:a]C[According to the result White get, it would be better to play simply at "a"]
