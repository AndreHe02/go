C[<taw> Hi pretorium, I'll be reviewing your game.];B[qp];W[dq]
;B[pd];W[op]C[White is very aggressive here. This could turn into early whole board fight.]
;B[pn];W[qq];B[pq]C[This doesn't work too well.
Easy sequence of moves would be black S3, white Q3, black S5, white goes for remaining corner.]
;W[pp];B[qr];W[qo];B[rq]C[Now everybody's stones in the corner are awkward. Black has a choice of abandoning Q6 stone (in which case the whole exchange was a big loss), or getting into awkward fight for it. White's situation isn't easy either. I guess it depends how comfortable you are with getting into big fights.]
;W[dd];B[dj];W[qf];B[ph]C[This is a very interesting one. It looks almost right, but I don't think it is. Q16, Q12, and Q6 are all on 4th line. Q6 is already weak. White is going to expand from R14, which must be responded by strengthening either Q12 or Q16 but not both. This wouldn't be too bad if bottom black corner was strong - white expands, black strengthens top right corner, Q12 with strong black corner (like let's say Q6, S5, R4, S3 vs white P4, Q3, R3) reinforce each other. In this case neither Q12 nor Q6 are safely anchored to the side, so they can't reinforce each other. I think R12 would be significantly stronger here - or maybe protecting corner with O17/O16 and letting white take the side.]
;W[of];B[ne]C[Black is way too aggressive here - corner is nowhere near safe enough. This should be 3rd or 4th line (O16 looks most natural), or reinforcing the side instead with something like Q9 or R9 - that weakens the corner significantly, but at least makes decent use of Q12/Q6. O15 doesn't help the side, and it doesn't strengthen the corner.]
;W[rh]C[Now imagine if Q12 was R12 instead. Stones on 3rd/4th lines look similar when board is empty, but it's a big difference as soon as some fighting starts.]
;B[qk]C[Black trying to salvage awkward situation. Overall it's not too bad, but black was overly aggressive going for 4th/5th line and ended up in somewhat unfavorable exchange, with pretty much everything it got weak and needing further defense.]
;W[co];B[dm]C[More overly aggressive 4th line moves. White could follow up with B7 at some point (it's not the biggest move yet) and then D10 D7 stones don't look too good. C7 or C14 would probably be better.
Or D14, because white would have to respond by defensing the D16 corner (it doesn't have to defend D3/C5 corner), so black could follow up with another stone and make something strong there.]
;W[jq];B[mq]C[It seems fairly small, and Q5 cut looks so tempting.]
;W[gq];B[cg]C[Much more solid move.];W[ce];B[jd];W[hc];B[le]
C[Many 4th line moves are a bit too aggressive, but this is going way too far. White can move against upper right corner or top side very aggressively, and O15 M15 stones won't be of much use. Meanwhile bottom right area can still end up with one side losing everything there - the only reason not to move there (even if not cutting then maybe P13 or S5 or something like that) is to grab some big move elsewhere like J17 or S16.]
;W[rd];B[qe]C[Black is being very aggressive here, R17 is much more natural, especially with corner being otherwise so weak witth to 3rd line support. This move makes sense a threat of S15, but if white connects S15, black would just do R17 so we are where we started..]
;W[ng]C[White ignored the threat of S15 cut. Black should probably followup.]
;B[ni]C[This move doesn't really do anything. Top right corner is weak, right side is weak. If black moved so aggressively with R15, wasn't this meant as a threat of S15? Or to setup black R17, white S15, corner is secure exchange.]
;W[re];B[qg];W[rg];B[pf]C[R13, Q14 look like black is thinking that it got the corner and it's attacking white group. But white group is perfectly fine and alive while black control over the corner is getting lost with every move wasted. Most natural move would probably be white R13 next, as losing stone at R14 costs it nothing, but white decided that it's strong enough it can move elsewhere.

By this point black is already quite a bit behind and it would need some difficult fight to get back into the game.]
;W[mp];B[nq];W[lp];B[po]C[I like what black is doing here.]
;W[jb];B[kb]C[That's a big tactical mistake. What would be black response to white L17? 5th line stones at M15 and O15 are not helping here at all - and white can still go with R17 whenever it feels like it.]
;W[bm]C[White is now making black pay the price for playing on 4th line instead of 3rd. It's easy to overlook such things as punishment happened so many moves after the mistake.]
;B[cl]C[Now imagine if D7/C8 were one line lower. Anyway, it's probably better idea to leave that for now and try K17 or R17 as upper right corner is completely open to whie attack from both sides while left group would probably do fine.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[Somebody was bound to move with R17.];W[fe];B[fg]
C[It's reasonable move locally, but it would probably be better to protect against white L17 cut, or whole top right corner will be lost.]
;W[ll];B[nn]C[Just like F15, M8 were fairly greedy white moves. Black probably ought to show white why such green doesn't pay while many groups on board are in danger by going after K17.
O6 is decent move in that area, but there are bigger moves.]
;W[bl];B[bk]C[Similar problem - good local response, but there are bigger moves elsewhere.]
;W[gn];B[lh];W[jl];B[jj];W[ie];B[je]C[Black seems to be operating under assumption that L17 cut can't happen.]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[ig];B[ih];W[hk];B[hj];W[mm];B[np];W[gk];B[gj]
;W[qb];B[ja]C[This move is just weird. White probably should have cut long time ago. Since it didn't, closing K17 which forces (not necessarily immediate) white J18 would be a good way to close this.
Or maybe Q18 to prevent white from wrecking what little territory black still has in the corner with O19 (which would be impossible to cut from R18 with no supporting  blackstones nearby).]
;W[ib];B[ic]C[This is a big tactical mistake, still ignoring L17 cut risk and Q18/O19 territory grab.]
;W[pb]C[White decided to do this, but it could have just as easily been O19 or L17.]
;B[ob];W[kc]C[And the cut finally came. This is extremely delayed punishment for L18, which wouldn't even be a bad move if M15 was played at M17 instead. So in a way white was able to do this because black was so eager to play on 5th line. What follows is white attack in every possible direction that requires black response.]
;B[lc]C[This doesn't work. Obvious white answer is M18, but white decides to prioritize some other areas first. I'm not sure if white decisions are correct, as black could abandon some of the other areas to salvage this one, but it's a bad situation for black in any case.]
;W[oa];B[na];W[sk];B[rm]C[O19 and S7 are both cases of white not following with its cut, giving black a chance to recover (at loss elsewhere), but black not taking advantage of it. Even locally, T9 slide should probably be answered by S7 threat of cut - but then white would probably ignore that and just go back to finishing L17 cut.]
;W[jf]C[White is being a bit greedy. Black could try salvaging the situation with K17.]
;B[ri]C[Black can't afford to do this with K17 or M18 crushing the whole group on the top.]
;W[jc]C[It was bound to happen sooner or later.];B[id]C[I think it's a good place to end the review. What follows is just tactical gameplay with some minor mistaken (the biggest probably being both players ignoring P11 cut), and tactical gameplay in complex fights will never be perfect, it just takes practice.

The big takeaway is that black was far too willing to make loose 4th/5th line moves leaving a lot of weak groups, which ends up setting up unfavourable fights to save such groups. Punishment happened long after such loose plays, but it happened for pretty much all of them.

Tactically, L18 was probably the weirdest move. Attaching directly to enemy stone on 2nd line only really makes sense when there's your stone protecting from 3rd line cut. (so in this case, if M17 was there to protect L18 from L17 cut). More complex situations will take a lot of practice, but that one was fairly straightforward pattern that's rarely good.

I hope this helps. Enjoy the game :-)];W[hd];B[la];W[ke];B[ld]
