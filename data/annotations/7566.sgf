C[Thank you for reviewing this game.
I had white.
I will try to add some comments to communicate what I was thinking and why I played the way I did.


*Hi, zee.  I'm Kirby.  It's nice to meet you.  I'll be reviewing your game for you.  I will prepend an asterisk to my comments.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[cf]C[I found this somewhat unusual.
I expected F17 instead

*I would probably play F17 instead of C14, as well.  At this eary of a stage in the opening, I can't say that C14 isn't playable.  But the reason I tend to favor F17 over C14 is that C14 makes it easy for white to make a pincer that works well with the D3 stone.]
;W[ch]TR[dq]C[I pincered because I had a stone at D3

* I think it's a good move.  You can also experiment with some wider pincers, but this is fine, I think.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec]C[Not joseki so I wanted to punish

*I don't think you need to immediately punish.  If you value the territory brought about by playing B17, you can incorporate it into your plan.  But from your comments, it seems like you were concerned about the top side after black did the hane at F16.  If you are concerned about it, don't let it happen.

*Plan of attack, if opponent makes a deviation from Joseki:
1.) Think of ways that you can punish.
2.) Read out what happens if you punish in that way.
3.) Decide if it is a better result for you, which can depend on your plan.
4.) Choose the move with the best result.

The important thing to notice is that, the move giving the best result from your reading may not always be a "punishing" move.  If the opponent plays suboptimally, sometimes you don't have to punish directly.  The important thing is to read ahead and find the best result.  Sometimes this will be a "punishing" move, and sometimes it will be a normal move.

I don't think that B17 was bad.  But if you are worried about black's territory after F16, then it goes against your plan.]
(;W[bc]C[*It's good, I think.  I wouldn't say that black has lost a ton, but I think that white gained a bit.]
;B[bb];W[bd];B[fd]
(;W[fe]C[Please see var

*I think that your move is OK, as shown in the variation.];B[gd]
;W[ge];B[hd]C[Now it seems that W is crawling from behind and B extending along the 4th line.

The top side is huge and is becoming black

*Hmm, yes.  I wouldn't say that white's wall is nothing, but you're right - black is getting 4th line territory, so it may be too much.

*If you are concerned about the top side, you can play there, even instead of G15 if you'd like.  

*Another thing to keep in mind, though, is that by playing B17, you indicated that you valued the territory in that area more than the top side.  If you want to avoid black getting more on the top side, I think it's even OK to play]
;W[nc]C[I wanted to reduce the top before it was too late

*It's an OK plan to break up black.  Keep in mind, though, that it gives black the opportunity to close up his top nicely with a pincer.]
;B[lc]C[*Which he did, it appears...];W[qc]C[*It's good, I think, because you can get territory.  Keep in mind, though, that this will give black a lot of power at the top.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[he]C[*Here, black has a good moyo at the top.  If I were white, I'd be slightly uncomfortable.  However, just because black is big at the top doesn't mean that white can't be big in other parts of the board.]
;W[hf]LB[gf:A]C[W shape seems to be weak

*Yes.  If black wanted to, he could play around with the cut at A, for example.  However, black can probably be content with building up the top side, since it's already getting kind of large.]
;B[if];W[ig]C[*This is kind of risky.  Black might try something like the variation.  I think it's quite dangerous for white.]
(;B[hg]C[I think, if I were black, I would do G14 instead.]
;W[gf];B[jg];W[ih];B[cj]C[*Black seems to feel something like, "OK, I have good potential at the top.  Now, I'm going to take away your potential on the left.]
;W[eh]LB[cl:A]C[I thought I should defend here

*Hmm, it might be risky because of the cut at E15.  It's kind of a pity for the weakness, though, because I really want to play something like C8.  In general, when you have a big wall like this, a great way to use it is to push black into it.  You'll likely get a big chunk of territory on the bottom left by attacking black in this way...  Still, the E15 cut does make things risky, so maybe defending is OK...  

*It's really a pity, though.  I really want to push black into the white area with something like A.]
;B[bh];W[bi];B[ci];W[bg];B[dh];W[cg];B[bj];W[ah];B[ei]LB[co:A]
C[*I don't think that this is so big for black.  I would prefer to do something like C5.]
;W[dg];B[di]C[The W group in the top left feels over concentrated now

*Yup.  That's why I wanted to play something like C8 earlier.  That way, you could have smashed him into your wall!  It'd at least get compensation for the huge top.  Now, w has several stones with something on the order of about 20 points with his group.]
;W[qn]LB[cn:A]SQ[co][nq]C[I decided to tenuki to get profit elsewhere.

Is this the wrong direction?
How about O3? or C5?

*I like C5.  I don't think R6 is necessarily the wrong direction.  It seems reasonable.  Personally, I feel that O3 is also OK.  But out of all of them, I like C5 the best.

*Though you didn't attack the single stone at C10 with C8 earlier, the black stones still don't have a base.  With that in mind, I'd probably consider C6, even. 

C6 is a wide corner enclosure, and has the added benefit of making the black stones cramped a bit.  It's a pity that black wasn't crushed against the white wall earlier, but there's still time to do something like that.  If you play C6, and black tenuki's, you can put mo re pressure on the C10 stones, which are presently just sitting there.

I think that something like C6 could be a chance to attack the C10 stones, and make a comeback for the top!]
;B[nq];W[jf]C[Trying to reduce B here/

Is it too soon?
Should I play on the right instead?
Something like R9?

*I still think that C6 or so sounds good.  R9 is OK, but I don't think the right side is that huge.  White's stones are all on the third line, and don't really have much potential for growth.  I think that C6 is the move I would play to try to attack the C10 stones.  You can get profit from attacking!

*But if we don't do C6 or something in that area, K14 seems like a reasonable alternative.  Black's top area is large, so it'd be good to reduce it.]
;B[ie];W[kg];B[pn]TR[qn]C[Ladder pbreaker damaged R6

*I think it's worth it.  Getting a ponnuki up there reduces the potential of the top, which is large.]
;W[jh];B[qm];W[kd]C[Decided to reduce in sente

*I don't think that R6 is completely dead, yet.  You can try to live or gain something, maybe starting with R5...  It doesn't need to be done immediately, though, so your play at the top is good, I think.  Reducing the top is still big.  Though, your ponnuki has helped with that a lot.]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[jc];W[md]LB[ld:A][le:B][me:C]C[*I was going to say that this doesn't seem huge, but I suppose that you could get away with it in sente, so it's probably OK.  Keep in mind, though, that black can try to cut through at M16 whenever he'd like.  Something like Black A, white B, Black C could be annoying for white in the future.]
;B[nb];W[co]C[Great!  I think that this side is important.  Like I said earlier, though, I might do C6, since it serves two purposes: 1.) It's an enclosure (though looser than yours).
2.) It gives black less room for a base with the C10 stones.  I would really like to attack the C10 stones to try to take control of the game right now.]
;B[cn];W[dn]SQ[do]C[Maybe this is overplay.
How about D5?

*I think black's C6 was an over play.  Your move seems fine.  You could also try B6 if you'd like.  I think that D5 is too easy on black.]
;B[bn];W[dm]SQ[bo]C[Now I think B5 is better??

*You could do B5, but then black can do D7 and push you more.  I like to fight more, so I'd play D7 like you did.  Then, if black plays D15, I'd play B8, perhaps.]

Maybe should have been at K7 to seal B in.
I thought B will defend and then I would seal him in.

;W[hm];B[in];W[kn];B[km];W[lm]C[W is too weak to hane?

Is N6 better?

*I think so.  It's dangerous for white now, in my opinion.  Black has support on the right, and can push you into it.]

*Yes.  Basically, as white, I would just do whatever I could to live right now.]

;B[tt]C[tflam [3k\]: ty
zee [4k\]: thx for the game

*I think that you played well, but there are a couple of general ideas to keep in mind.  First, you did a good job at reducing the top, but if you were concerned about the top to begin with, you could have prevented its size early on: You don't always have to directly punish moves.  Read ahead, and find the best result.

Second, I think that, as you mentioned, you really needed to seal black in with K7.  It was essental.  You might have been able to win if you could have effectively attacked his group there.  

Another highlight was that you need to use your influence, if possible.  I think that C8 would have been great after C10, but you would have to be careful of the aji of the E15 cut.  But even after you played the defensive move of E12, you still could have attacked his group later on with C6, for example.  I think that you should try to attack more to gain more.]
