C[Chocobovn [11k\]: Hello, this game is played on KGS. I'm black. I had some chances to make moyo and earn me an easier win, but because of many reason (all is because I'm weak ^_^), I lost those chances. Please show me the right way to conquer!^_^

Thank you for your comments!

My name is Araldo van de Kraats, 4k in the Netherlands. Hope I can help you a bit with this review. Most comments are about strategic decisions, since it seems to me that is where you can improve the most.

Note that when I do not give any comment on a move, it mostly means they are fine.]

(;B[pj]SQ[pq][qo]C[Araldo: I think this move is not very good. It protects two groups which are safe anyway. Sure, it does claim a bit of territory, but there are bigger moves on the board.

I prefer K4, since it starts a moyo in combination with the marked stones. See variation for a likely continuation after J4.]
;W[cj];B[fq];W[dn];B[iq];W[eq];B[fp];W[er];B[gr]C[Araldo: White cannot do much damage if you had ignored E2. This move is worth less than 10 points, which is definitely not enough in this stage of the game. Try to ignore these kinds of moves and play only moves which are 15 points or more in the opening (often difficult to calculate, so you may have to guess).]
;W[de]
(;B[hc]C[Araldo: Good timing for this invasion (one move earlier would have been even better). However, you do not make it very difficult for white to seal you in. He gets excellent influence and you only get 10 points of territory. This is not a big problem if you can neutralize his influence somehow (prevent him using his influence to attack you or to make a lot of territory). Which is what you didn't...

A better place for an invasion may be K17. This threatens the two white stones (since they are placed on the 4th line, you can slide under them to remove eyespace). The nice thing about K17 is that you can prevent yourself from getting sealed in and prevent white from getting a magnificent wall.

See variation for what I mean.];W[he];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb]C[This move aim for aji at c17 when w respond with d18.

Araldo: I like that. Very clever.];W[db];B[fb];W[fd];B[kc];W[kd]
;B[jc];W[lc];B[lb]C[Araldo: This is a gote move. I believe this move is not necessary, since your group is alive even without it (I may be wrong but I couldn't find a way to kill it for white). This implies this move is worth less than 10 points, which is too small.

Better to take the initiative in the centre now.];W[mb];B[kb]
C[Araldo: Note white doesn't have to defend due to the P16 stone.]
;W[pl];B[qk]C[Araldo: Good, removes all eyespace for white.]
;W[ql]C[Araldo: A bad move by white, since it cuts two strong groups and makes his own stones heavy. A good opportunity to make territory at the bottom and reduce the influence of white at the top. See variation for how I would have played.]

(;B[lp]C[Araldo: I don't like this move. Too easy for white. Better make territory while attacking than making purely defensive moves.]
;W[nl];B[on]C[What is the good move at this moment? This move is quite big, but not urgent.
While I played, I notice I had 2 good moves at c17 and around q17, but I wanted to leave them for later. But I lost the chance to use them later in the game, so please show me when is the right moment to use them?

---

Araldo: Probably one move too late. Now it is not very useful anymore. Actually it does not do anything, except securing maybe five points of territory. White can safely ignore this gote move and start to attack you. Better use forcing moves to make territory.]
;W[pk];B[rk];W[oj];B[pi]C[Bend backward. That's why p6 is bad.

---

Araldo: Yes, this is awful. But there is nothing you can do anymore. The reason white could do this are the two gote moves you played (M4 and P6), instead of O10

In the future, if you see a weak opponent group only think one thing: Attack!!!]
;W[oi];B[ph];W[ng]SQ[cj][de][dn][fd][he][kd][ld][nl][oi][oj]
C[Araldo: Okay, now you have a big problem. White is about to claim the complete centre of the board as his territory, using the marked moyo.

I have a feeling it is too late to win this game without mistakes of the opponent. Black is behind somewhere between 20-50 points and it will be difficult to overcome this.

Still black can try some risky things to try to destroy white's territory as much as possible. For example jump right in the middle an try to live, or maybe E10.]
;B[fn]C[This move, feel bad, too.

Araldo: Normally this is not a bad move (I would play F7). However, you are far behind in this game, so this will be much to slow.]
;W[ej];B[fl];W[el];B[hk];W[jl]C[Araldo: White gives you a last opportunity to jump right into the middle of his moyo (which destroys a large part of his centre territory). However, you choose to defend your own territory for 20 extra points... in exchange for 50 for you opponent.]

;B[jn];W[lj];B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[ki];B[mm];W[mj];B[mk]C[Araldo: This move is worth close to zero points. Q17 or C17 would have been much larger.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pc]C[Lost a big move to the opponent.

---

Araldo: indeed. Now you should to find an opportunity to play the last big one yourself.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[oh];W[nh];B[of];W[nf];B[pd]C[Araldo: A good sequence of forcing moves.]
;W[oc];B[oe]C[Araldo: This one is a bit small. Better C17];W[ne]
;B[rb]C[Araldo: Again, much smaller than C17];W[dc]C[Ofcourse c17 is bigger than s18, I lost the second big move. T_T

Araldo: I think the game is over now, except for some small endgame moves.]

C[He responded as I wanted!];B[cq]C[Araldo: Of course, this shouldn't be possible. But your opponent made several bad move in this corner, so you where very lucky.

This is the end of my review. A short summary of important points:

- Do not make gote moves unless the are very big
- Ignore more moves (try to check if this is possible every single move)
- Try to prevent your opponent from getting outside influence everywhere (sacrifice some territory if necessary)
- Attack
- Attack
- Attack

Any questions are welcome.
