C[Hello,

I hope you can help me and find the biggest mistakes I made during this game. Please advise me for a better strategy.

Thanks

Rainer

Mans: First of all I am very impressed with the game. There are very few obvious errors.  I would classify this as a nice game, where none of the players are pushing the limits. Therefore I consider your loss as accidental. You could have been the one winning with 6.5 points instead. Therefore there is not much to say about individual moves, but more on the overall board situation.

Enjoy the comments, and remeber that my theories are not laws. A player of strength 1 kyu would laugh at most of my suggestions :)]

The main problem was that you thought that the upper right corner was safe. You should have played R16 much earlier. The other issue is that you didn't play the end game in the right order. As you see white also made very large territory on the left side.]
