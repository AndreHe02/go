C[buckyyowza: comments by Mark Fyffe (10k* igs, 6k* nngs).]

[nn:C]C[buckyyowza: usually A (o4) is played. now a black stone at B (r10) is a real bummer for white, who still needs to play A. if black jumps out to C now, he can easily invade the corner at r3, but playing B to prevent r8 from settling is more urgent.]
;B[cj]LB[om:A][ol:B]C[buckyyowza: good play off of d16 hoshi, but very small considering the amount of damage black could be doing in the lower right. white can now keima at A (p7) or ikken tobi at B (p8) and put some pressure on the q6 group while building some nice thickness in the center.]
;W[pi]LB[nn:A][qg:B][np:C]C[buckyyowza: A (o6) is urgent for black now. white can play B (r13) to settle his group with a nice approach to the upper right corner or play C (o4)]
;B[cn]LB[fp:A][ni:B]C[buckyyowza: w at A (f4) is a horrid result for black. especially if white is not stopped from jumping ikken tobe on the right and side in time.  since c6 practically forces A, this makes it a bad move.]
;W[dl]LB[en:A]C[buckyyowza: bad move! black at A (e6) is  very big and puts black a stone ahead locally. see variation.]

(;B[bl]LB[gp:A]C[buckyyowza: way too slow! white A (g4) is a huge now.]
;W[dn]C[buckyyowza: q6 group is too much bad aji for white too play d6 since it is easily cut.]
;B[co]C[buckyyowza: this helps white seal a very thick lower side, an ideal outcome for white.]
;W[do];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp]
(;W[dq]C[buckyyowza: a little slow,  see variations on 19.]
;B[cr];W[dr];B[jq]C[buckyyowza: bad choice after forcing white to make such a nice wall. w c7 is very dangerous now! see variation]

(;W[cm];B[bm];W[mq];B[gr];W[cs]LB[hq:A]C[buckyyowza: A (h3) would easily punish black for bad shape (too low).]
;B[bs];W[ds];B[br];W[dj];B[cg]TR[gr][jq][pn][qn]C[buckyyowza: white is really getting too much influence from that wall. black's marked stones can now be considered dead.]
;W[fc];B[eg];W[ci];B[bj];W[dh];B[dg];W[bi];B[ei]C[buckyyowza: it is insane of white to allow this activity. f17 is looking lonely and the stones noted as dead after move 33 are no longer dead.]
;W[ej];B[eh]LB[di:A]C[buckyyowza: A (d11) is an easy cut, and would have given black a slight advantage over this outcome.]
;W[di];B[fd]LB[gj:A]C[buckyyowza: f17 is not a significant threat, especially considering how bad white A (g10) is for black.]
;W[dc]LB[gd:A]C[buckyyowza: should be at A (g16).  white is easily enclosed and maybe killed after d17 where building thickness on the upper side would have been much bigger.]
;B[cc]LB[gc:A]C[buckyyowza: more improtant to protect the side with A (g17)]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[de];B[cd];W[ee];B[ce]C[buckyyowza: white's play here is suicidal.]

C[The game is over.  Final score:
   White = 67 territory + 17 captures + 0.5 komi = 84.5
   Black = 50 territory + 4 captures = 54
White wins by 30.5.

buckyyowza: nice game.  this was a pretty close match for play at your level.  your biggest problems are leaving joseki prematurely and trading too much influence for too little territory.  it is better to get no points in territory than to be enclosed.

black's play is too local and paranoid about liberty shortages.  an extra liberty is very good aji, but you need to use it... the aji in not seeing the extra liberty is bad enough to put you in gote unnecessarily. you need to consider the whole board, not just the safety of your stones. you need at least as many points as your opponent to win, so with each move you need to have a plan for making up the difference or keeping a comfortable lead. think about what is alive, what is dead, what is connected to what, what is effectively connected to what, and what can escape and to where. as you learn to see the board better by constantly keeping an eye on these things, the score should seem more obvious, as well as how to even it.    it's been a fun looking over this game. let me know if you have any further questions about this game or about go at all.
