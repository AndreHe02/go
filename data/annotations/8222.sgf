C[TM—Hello, I'm the reviewer. I have one main piece of advice, which is to pay attention to weak groups. If you spend time at the beginning to make more stable bases for your groups, and ideally to keep everything connected, then you will not run into problems later on.

Notice that white didn't need to make any big captures to win: she had only eaten 4 stones by the time the comments end, and the rest is endgame. It was sufficient for your opponent to take advantage of the weakness of your groups to prevent you from making territory.

Of particular importance are moves 7 and 35, where you played tenuki instead of the natural move. Before tenuki, consider the cost!]

TM—When white hits at D3, you really must play E4. Anything else is out of the question.]
;W[ep]C[TM—This is painful!];B[ck];W[fq];B[cf];W[ci]LB[ek:A]
C[giving black a target - but how best to exploit it?


TM—Not as much a target as you might think. White is now very strong in the lower left, so she can afford to play a severe move like this to split you in half. It might be safest here to just jump out into the centre at A.]
;B[dj];W[di];B[bd]LB[fc:A]C[TM—You could also consider playing at A instead, treating C14 more lightly.]
;W[ef]C[should black cut?


TM—I think that would be premature. Get some stable groups first, then fight.]
(;B[cc];W[dc];B[hc];W[ej];B[ek]LB[fk:A]C[TM—This, I think, is one reason why it would be better to just jump out directly earlier. You end up playing the same move, but now white might be able to hem you in with a move like A.]
;W[cj];B[dk];W[ei]C[TM—These are very slow moves by white. Still, I'd be concerned for the group in the lower left. It doesn't have much space and has a strong white group on either side.]
;B[kc]LB[kd:A]SQ[cc][hc][pc][cf][ck][cn][eq]C[TM—This is fine. Notice, however, that almost all of your moves so far have been on the third line. How about a more dynamic move, say at A?]
;W[mc];B[qe]LB[nd:B][le:A]C[thinking of a roundabout attack, expecting white to jump into the centre


TM—Since white's move was so low, consider a move like A, which threatens B. This gives your upper group a bit more shape, and you can build territory along the right as you pressure white.]
;W[nq];B[lp];W[no];B[pn];W[qq]LB[pr:A]C[TM—Typically, A is better. If white plays in the corner instead then you will be able to separate her three stones.]
;B[pq];W[pr]
(;B[hq]LB[or:A]C[comment?


TM—A very strange move! You are playing close to white's strength while letting her connect at A. As a result, you will have two isolated stones along the bottom between very strong white groups, and your group in the bottom right corner will have no base. You must play A instead, without question.]

(;B[kq]LB[np:A]SQ[mq]C[comment?


TM—It seemed to me that the goal of your previous move (marked) was to get space for your stones at the bottom while threatening to cut at A. White declined to defend the cut, so I'm surprised you didn't follow through with it.]
;W[mp]C[TM—Now the cut is impossible, and your stones are under attack.]

(;B[rm]LB[pj:A]C[TM—Since you don't really have anything to defend on the side here, what about A instead? This would relate better to your stones at the top.]

C[TM—Please compare this to the variation starting at move 55.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[lq];B[kp];W[ln]C[TM—Notice how white is trying her best to keep your groups separated and weak, and doing a good job of it.]
;B[ml];W[me];B[ke];W[mg];B[oh];W[ql];B[ro]LB[nj:A]C[too slow?


TM—I would rather first try to find a move that connects your groups and separates white's, for example around A. If white needs to live by capturing S7, well, that's just a few points.]
;W[sk];B[bo]LB[go:A]C[TM—The timing here is very strange. If you're concerned about your weak group (and you should be), what about instead looking for a move that helps another weak group at the same time, such as around A?]
;W[sm];B[nj];W[kf];B[jf];W[kg];B[jg];W[le];B[ld]LB[je:A]C[not a good move; the obvious choice is K16, but black doesnt white to settle easily.  comment?

;W[gb]C[from here on, black felt ahead and played conservatively to maintain his lead - but was surprised at the end to have lost by a fair amount.  comment?


TM—Neither player has a lot of territory, but white's is secure, while yours is not. Since you still have to spend moves to connect your groups and fix your defences, white has time, for example, to erase all the territory in the upper right corner.
