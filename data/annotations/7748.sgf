C[CZR: Hi, my name is CaeZaR on kgs.  If you have any questions, please send them to CaeZaR.kgs@usask.ca.  If you find this review helpful, please do not hesitate to ask for me by name for your next gtl review.

My review philosophy:

A good kyu review should not address every error in play; rather, it should focus on the major errors in the game, especially those errors that are repeated.  As a kyu player myself, I am incapable of finding every error anyway.

I try to restrict my comments to those that I am confident in.  Never-the-less, as my play is error prone, I may make reviewing mistakes (miss bad moves and rebuke decent/good moves) and for that I do apologize.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[op]C[CZR: This is not standard, but playable.]
;W[dd];B[oj]C[CZR: In general, you can't expect to hold territory on the side by placing stones on the 5th line as White can play on the 3rd line and live without being under pressure.

If you want to go for territory, play R10.  If you want to play early moves for influence around the board play Q10.]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[qk];B[lc]C[CZR: I like your choice to play here as White didn't play the natural extension and finding a good response to R9 is difficult given the strangly placed 5th line stones.]
;W[ne]
(;B[nf]C[CZR: Attacking these stones directly isn't the right way to exploit them.  At this stage of the game, it is difficult to kill groups outright and unprofitable to try.  A better idea would be to strengthen your M17 stone by making a base for it at J17.  See variation.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]C[CZR: See variation.];W[pc]
(;B[oe];W[od]TR[oe]C[CZR: This exchange helped White fix his problems, and was bad for you.]
;B[rd];W[rc];B[sd]C[CZR: In general moves on the first line should be left until later in the game because there are much more important areas of the board to play this early on.  White can safely ignore this move which means White can now take sente.]
;W[sc]TR[fc][gc][fd][gd][cf][df][cg][dg][cj][dj][cm][dm][cn]
[dn][fp][gp][qp][fq][gq]SQ[jc][lc]C[CZR: Bad.  White should play something big (some options marked), or could consider putting pressure on the marked Black stone with the squared move.]
;B[eq]C[CZR: This approach has a very good follow up by White (D3), so it is generally avoided.  That is why you leave at least one space in your approach.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eo];B[gp];W[fo]C[CZR: This spot is good for Black and White, so it benefits White to take it.]
;B[gq];W[fp];B[fq]TR[fp]C[CZR: Pointless exchange for White.]

;B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[pm];B[nm]C[CZR: If you are worried about White poking through here, why not just make the solid connection at P7?]
;W[po];B[oo];W[pn]C[CZR: There is no reason for a White stone here.]
(;B[nh]C[CZR: The move really doesn't lay hold of the territory underneath it because White can slide in from the side.  See variation.]
;W[qi];B[ni]C[CZR: This move doesn't make any territory either and only adds strength where you are already strong.  Conside approaching the upper left as it is still an unfinished corner.]
;W[pi];B[ng];W[me];B[of];W[mc];B[le];W[fd];B[kd];W[hd]TR[lc]
[kd][le]C[CZR: The marked Black group is now looking weak and unsettled.  Best to try and fix that now.  See variation.]
(;B[ld]C[CZR: This doesn't help make area for a base.];W[dg]
;B[ho];W[dj];B[kj]TR[dg][dj][ho]C[CZR: Consider how much more White secured with these last two moves than you did.  White played in the most open remaining area and got a lot more.]
