(;W[qf]C[I would prefer C7 or O3. The upper right is not as urgent, and it's hard to find a good answer if black plays a pincer.]
;B[qh]
(;W[nd]C[The upper side is not appealing. The low position of F17 makes it hard to develop much territory there.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[qg];W[pc];B[qe];W[qc]C[This result is unsatisfactory for white - now F17 should be at E16. Black gets sente, too.]
;B[fq]C[This looks like wrong direction.];W[hq]C[I would rather play C7. What is the point playing a pincer when the surrounding stones (Q4 and C9) are black?]
;B[fo];W[cn];B[jq]C[This is a strange move - F3 and F5 are not really strong yet.]

(;W[ep]C[This is a bad move. Your are strengthening your strong stones and weakening your weak ones ...]
;B[fp];W[bp];B[fm];W[np]C[I think this is an overplay. On the other hand - I don't see any good way to settle your three stones.]
;B[lp]C[shmolex: I didn't really have any idea what to do here.  My 3 H stones are too weak to use to attack his 3 stones.  I wont form a base here and running would be not a good option.  Perhaps a double approach would be best?

Given this situation, I would try play a double approach, but the situation is difficult.]
;W[lo];B[mp];W[ko]C[What is this? Letting black push through your formation at N5 is unbearable!!!]
;B[mo]
(;W[jo]C[This is bad shape - what happens if black pushs through and cuts?]

(;B[ir]C[What is this? Black must push through and cut, and the game is over.]
;W[gr];B[mm];W[eq];B[io]C[This is the wrong timing - F2 is more important right now.]

Well, there were other mistakes before - I wouldn't blame this single move.]
;B[gk];W[qm];B[qo];W[qj];B[pl]C[This and the next move looks strange. Don't attach to stones you want to attack.]

(;B[lc]C[shmolex: That went pretty well.  Aji exploitation to its finest :)

Well, you cannot expect to get much territory on the upper side.]
;W[mc]C[shmolex: I know touching the stone is bad.  I thought about pincering/extending around j17, but then black could slide under at o18 and then my white group is in some trouble.

I think O17 is correct shape.];B[mb];W[nb];B[md];W[nc];B[ld]
;W[ic];B[gd];W[gc];B[id];W[fd];B[hc];W[ge]C[This is aji-keshi (i.e. you might want to play H18 instead).
Just playing F15 or F14 looks better.];B[hd];W[ef]C[This eliminates the aji at C12.]

Well, the difference is not really big (see variation).]

A8 is only 8 points gote, isn't it? S16 looks ok.];B[re];W[se]
