AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[gpi: I added some variations to the game. These variations are an idea, how to coninue the game. If you can find better moves, feel free to use your own moves. Since white has won this game by far, it's difficult to give some general hints for white to do better. Maybe white should try to make territorry instead of attack to kill.

(;W[js]C[gpi: After this move black can live by playing F2.]
;B[nl]C[Do you have any clue why black left F2 as untouched? It would make two eyes and save group.

gpi: I think black did not see this move. Anyway it could be a plan for black to give up this group and get the upper side as territorry. But black failed as well. (See commentary to moves 44 and 45.)]
