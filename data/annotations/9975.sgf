C[Hello,
in this game I often had to decide between a big and an urgent move, and I always chose the urgent move. Maybe I wasn't as weak as I thought and played too many slow moves because of that?
Also I feel that I started to attack to early, I could've avoided one invasion by completly connecting my groups instead of attacking.
This invasion generally confused me. I seemed so confident in this area and yet my opponent was able to seperate me.

;B[nq];W[or]C[Maybe responding normally at Q/R 6 would've been better? But I judged that since white has a position on the right and on the left this kind of move would be good.]

;B[hr]C[good for white again :)];W[do];B[cn];W[cl]LB[qm:A]C[Was this attack any good? Maybe white should've first elimanated any invasion potential on the right side, by playing at A?

CC: it looks natural to attack. i think it is good.];B[dl];W[dk]
;B[el];W[cj]C[Here I would've liked to play E6, however I didn't think I was strong enough to do that.]
;B[qn]LB[qg:A]C[Maybe white should've played at A right now? But that would make P2 look rather stupid, I think.

CC: black just tenukis! wow. left side is urgent. in this case you usually have to protect corner territory or p2 is strange like you said]
;W[qo]C[CC: looks good];B[qh];W[pn]LB[qm:A]C[Maybe this was a mistake? And white should've played the clamp at A instead? A would connect white's groups, right? This hane however forced black into seperating white.

CC: i think this is good. very good shape. you should be happy with this result for sure. clamp is not a good idea.]

;B[nm];W[ol];B[ok];W[nl];B[nk];W[ml]C[I decided to play this ladder just because it doesn't work for black. But maybe it would've been better to just keep protecting R10 group?]

(;W[no]C[At this point I decided not to play S4, because I thought O5 was an urgent move. It connects white's groups. Black can take the corner, which would be a big point, but urgent points first. At least this was my thinking.]

;B[kq];W[oh];B[mk];W[ll]C[CC: black took your corner... you have thickness but L3 reduces it pretty well. your group on the right is not really alive but its ok. this result since the fight broke out on the right was good for black but the game is still looking good for white because of black weak groups on the left.]
