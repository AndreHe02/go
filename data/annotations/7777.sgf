C[Thinking: Hi, thanks in advance for reviewing my game!];B[pd]
;W[qp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ic];W[qf];B[md]C[You should be happy with this result. You've spread your stones much better around the table, while Black's stones inefficiently crowd on just one side.

(The only thing, if anything, you have to be concerned about is that r14 doesn't play well with r4 because they are both on the third line (the line of territory), and it's too early to make territory.)

Now let's look at Black's move. Why did he play there? I don't know. It's trying too hard to connect to q16 and j17 at the same time, and ends up leaving weakness on both sides. You should be happy with this. N16 is far enough away from q16 that these two stones may eventually be cut. And n16 is definitely far enough away from j17 that there is weakness there (for later).

r14 is low and flexible (can escape into the corner or down the side), and it has done its work (make Black play an inefficient move). You should settle it in sente or leave it for now.]
;W[pj]C[This would be a good move if you already had another stone in the bottom right. But as the board stands, this move would be better played in the bottom right.

The bottom right is more interesting because:
- "corners before edges"
- r14 can take care of itself
- r4 is low (if r4 were at q3, q10 would be a good move)];B[cn]
;W[fp]C[Why do you play high here? I can't see you getting sente this way, and that means Black gets to play p4.]
;B[dj];W[ed]C[I've always been pretty lousy at invasions. Black is strong all around and I didn't have a clue as to how to react to his moves.

I think its too early to invade. I know the black framework looks ominous. I'm concerned about it too. But none of your stones are strong yet. The bottom left particularly so.

Black's strategy now should be to settle the top left in sente, preferably in a way that leaves you without a base (d17 is the simplest, if not the best way), then play h3.

I'd prefer p4 here.]
(;B[df];W[cc]C[I wanted to settle quickly, so I figured 3-3 might give me some hope.

I think it's a good move.];B[bc]
(;W[dc];B[bb]C[This is the result I expected.

This isn't much good. You don't have a base, and just g17 won't be enough.

I think you can get a better result if you play b18. Take a look (and let me know if you find problems).]
(;W[gc]C[This move felt pretty bad. I wanted to get a base, but even with this move there was no way I could've made two eyes in that narrow space. Should I have jumped out first, instead?

This move aims at the weakness at l17, and with the weakness between n16 and q16 and the top right still not settled, Black has some concerns. I think this move makes an eye in sente, though it forces Black to strengthen his position so it might be best to leave it for a while. If not g17, I think e14.]
;B[ff]C[Now you have to think to yourself: what's the best way to attack j16. I think it's l17, with the slight possibility of letting the top left White group die.]
(;W[ge]C[This move doesn't quite get out. There is a proverb: "contact moves for defense". This suggests j16 is better here. The reasons contact moves are good for defense is that they tend to strengthen both sides. Also, j16 is a contact move at the same time as getting you closer to the outside.]
;B[ie]C[I think g15 at j16 would be better than this. If you are willing to let Black get strong, you may as well get something in return.]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[gh]C[This is very good play by Black.]
;W[if];B[je]
(;W[bj]C[Black's left side looked so enormous I felt like I had to do something about it. It looks like I should have a harder time than I did, were black's moves too easygoing?

This is too early.

L13 is a pivotal point right now. Look how Black l13 keeps you cut off while imposing on the right side. Look how White l13 frees you while creating a potential moyo on the right side, and possible later invasions into the top and top right.

Black's strategy should be to allow b10 to live small, keep sente, play l13 in sente, then using the strength created on the left, play h3 to attack the bottom left. Then when that is settled, or while it is settling, extend along the bottom side towards the bottom right corner.]
;B[cl];W[cg]C[I think Black b12 is pretty deadly here.];B[cf]
;W[ck];B[dk];W[bl];B[cj];W[bk];B[cm];W[ci];B[di];W[bh];B[op]
;W[pn];B[qq];W[pq]C[Better s3 to settle quickly in sente.];B[pp]
;W[qr]C[This is some sort of trick position taught by breakfast, I've been really fond of it since my opponent's usually fall for it.

(I know tricking is generally bad, as it can backfire miserably)

What does it do? You better get strong in sente. Or leave Black holding the corner with q4 cut off. Anyway, let's see...]
;B[rq];W[rp]
(;B[rr]C[Totally unexpected move.];W[pr];B[or];W[oq];B[nq];W[nr]
;B[mr];W[os];B[mq]C[Black made this easy for me, corner in sente.

(While I was reading it out, I thought there was no way black could win the capturing race and decided to play tenuki)]
(;W[of]C[Would Q5 have been better? R5 looks so annoying.

Did you even look at the bottom left corner? You've got only two stones, both on the fourth line, with Black with low and strong positions on both sides. How could it be any worse?!

b4 is huge.]
(;B[qs]C[Black r5 is better.];W[rs];B[ss];W[sq];B[ms];W[ns]
(;B[bp]C[I thought playing C3 would be too slow, considering black could play a move such as H3?]
;W[hq]C[This move should be at c3. You need a base. Black is too strong to attack. Black should play c3 now...]
;B[cq]C[Nice. If you played c3 instead of h3, you'd have b3 as a follow up move to make you safe. but this way you don't have any such move.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[jp];B[ko]
(;W[po]C[I wanted to get rid of R5.

Try o5 isntead.];B[no];W[ii]C[I was unsure of my only weak groups condition, so I decided to jump out once again.

Better safe than sorry, I suppose...

The bottom is weak too, and surrounded by strong Black groups. D3 is better.

(Locally, I still think l13 is better.)];B[jo];W[ip]C[I'd prefer k3.]
(;B[lq]C[Black should play e2 and k2, not here.];W[kr]C[That's such a bad exchange for Black.]
;B[hj]C[This is weak. Black should play j9. I think Black must be going for territory here, but there are far bigger moves (r16, for example).]
;W[dh];B[eh];W[qc]C[This is good. Black has let you get strong enough that you can afford this attack.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd];W[rc];B[qe];W[nb]C[At this point I noticed N16 wasn't at O16. My eyes were deceiving me. : )]

It's all about a huge fight, and I end up not killing L15.

I was so sure I could catch it.

You've got a big ugly dumpling short on liberties squeezed between a stronger group and a strong group. It looks more like the game is over.]
;W[lh];B[jh];W[ji];B[ki]C[At this point I realized L12 wasn't going to work, and I got more or less desperate.]

(;W[fl];B[gk];W[fk];B[fj];W[hl];B[gj];W[go];B[en];W[fn]C[Rest is just yose I suppose... any endgame suggestions?

I think Black h18 kills White...

...or comes very close.

I've put some notes in about yose. But the earlier part of the game is more interesting.

The opening, particularly the direction (knowing where the interesting parts of the boards are for putting your stones). You could improve this area of your game.

Also the middle game, knowing how to settle weak groups, and to do so in a way that works with the rest of the board. It's worth having weak groups, really. A go player who never has weak groups will always live strong, and lose by a little bit.

Now here's a revision task for you. Write down on a bit of paper or in Notepad this list of move numbers: 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 28, 44, 66, 72, 74, 77, 122, 154, 173. Most of these are White moves but some are Black moves. Now *turn off comments*, and look at each move and answer the question "what was wrong with this move and how could it be better played?"

Any questions: e-mail me at ben.bildstein at gmail.com (not just you Thinking, but also anyone else reading this review.)]
