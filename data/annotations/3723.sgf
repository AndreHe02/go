C[Hi.  I am Rob Fielding (rfielding on KGS).  I am about 11k.  I used SmartGo to do the editing of this file, so you might get the most out of the review if you use SmartGo viewer to see the results.]
;B[pd];W[cd]C[slightly unusual opening stone for W... still used in pro games though.  emphasizes left side, clearly aims to take bottom left if given the opportunity]

;B[do]MA[ed]C[D5 is a fine move sometimes played by pros, E16 most common though.  D5 is agressive.  Will aim for left side at cost of giving some of bottom to w.]
;W[fp]MA[co][dl][dm]C[F4 falls out of common pro openings.  Marked locations (D8,D7,C5) are more common.  When black acts to strengthen his stone, E17 or D10 seems bigger for white, so D5 ends with Gote here.]

(;W[gc]C[Q: is pincer the correct move ?
A: black is sure to jump to E14 or contact at F17, then jump.  C14 is almost an obligation in response.  So G10 is a risky move that either troubles C12 stone or G17 stone.  See variations.]

(;B[fc];W[gd];B[cc]C[Q:  what the best move to response Black C17 ?

A:  note that white now has to deal with 2 weak groups.  If he attempts to make life in the corner, he may end up surrounded on one side or the other.  The sequence wD17, bD16 may not get the corner.  It is probably best to jump out to the center for the time being.]

;B[qh];W[qi];B[pg];W[oh];B[nb];W[no];B[np];W[ln];B[nj]C[Q: is Black o10 to deep or not ? what is the best white response ?

A: the probe is deep, but point should be to sacrifice some stones to get a foothold into this area.  This is feasible because of opening around E14, and E8 area.]

(;W[ok]C[Q: is this the correct move to response Black o10

A:  the little bit of territory you spare will be lost in the race to cut off black from his allies at the top]
;B[nh];W[og];B[ng];W[of];B[nf];W[oe]
(;B[pf]TR[pg][qg][qh]C[at this critical moment, black risks getting cut off by not playing O15.  Q14 allows for black to connect into the center while surrounding his wall facing it.  a black jump to the center is probably worth more than saving those stones, because even if saved, they have no more potential, and don't participate in the life of anything.]

(;W[jg]C[Q: i think K13 doesn't make pressure to black middle group. is there any better way to attack black middle group

;W[mk]
(;B[nk]C[Q: i think black must cut my stone at q11, instead of saving his three black stone. is much bigger right ?

A: black is still connected.  L9 stones can be laddered by W.  But a ladder amounts to a free ladder breaking move in vacinity of H7, so it's best avoided.  If you don't connect, and no ladder, then you have E14 and K9 and D5 primed to invade.]

A:  right.  playing in territory that is definitely yours loses a point, and there's no danger at all in this case.  in fact, if white did invade and the game was very close, black might risk allowing white to play a few times uncontested, so long as there were no risk of white making life.  that would gain a few points for black due to white's overplays.  the only way that such an invasion could endanger black is if he managed to make a single eye inside of black's group, while preventing black from making an eye of his own.  (or if white could not make an eye, but make all liberties shared liberties, then that would be seki)]
