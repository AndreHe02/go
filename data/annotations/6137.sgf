Actually, this depends on your personal style. It is absolutely not a bad move and can also make less effective a pincer from white.]

White is trying to make you heavier stealing your eye shape. Try to think at the difference if F12 was black. 
  
I don't think it's actually a good move for white,  because he has many weak points in his shape that you can use to make you stronger, such as the marked ones.]

I think that in order to live, white has to make a ko fight (see variation)]
