AB[pd][dp]C[PM:  Thanks for the review!  I took white and lost by 14.5 points.  I tried a lot of things I don't usually do in games, so I was hoping you could point out some better moves for me.

[JB\] I will try to do my best. But in summary I think you need a more agressive play when playing white with handicap.]

;W[lb]C[[JB\] I would have tried M16 probably,];B[ld];W[id]
;B[hd];W[fc]C[[JB\] I think that for white it is better to cut at J15 first.]
;B[ie];W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[od];B[pe];W[ng]C[[JB\] As you can see, this move is not efficient; instead, having cut at J15 first white can play with sente.
You still have the cut at H15, and it is a good point to attack.
But so far I think you need to be more agressive, because black stil keeps the 2 handicap stones difference.]
;B[cf];W[bd];B[ci];W[cn];B[gp];W[ck];B[ee]C[[JB\] This is a good move for black. Now the cut at H15 is not possible.]
;W[gb]C[[JB\] I do not like this move. I understand you want to protect the corner, but it may be better to use a move more agressive like F16 to avoid giving sente to black.]
;B[hb]C[[JB\] This black move could be omitted];W[eq]C[PM:  I wasn't sure about this, but I remembered black's shape here has a weakness.

[JB\] I did not find this pattern... in fact I think that depending on black's response it can weaken the white stones at C6/C9.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[co];W[bo];B[bp]C[[JB\] Black D6 would be better]
;W[do];B[cp];W[en];B[bn];W[bm];B[an];W[am];B[ao];W[cl];B[dr]
;W[er];B[jp]C[[JB\] Not bad for white, but you are still behind.]

(;W[lp]C[[JB\] I think M3 is a better invasion point. Black territory at the bottom can be destroyed. Eg. see variation 2.]
;B[lo];W[mo];B[mp];W[ko];B[kp];W[ln];B[lq];W[no];B[oo];W[on]
;B[qp];W[rp];B[pr];W[po];B[op];W[qk]C[[JB\] This is quite safe, but I think you have to be more agressive, e.g. Q11 or R12.
You still need to recover about 18 points here.];B[qj];W[rk]
;B[rj];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[nj];W[lf];B[ig];W[jg]C[[JB\] This one helps black to do some territory at the center. If you are afraid of not living, remember you still have L16.]

[js][jr][jq][bo][ap][aq][ar][as][bq][br][bs][cq]C[[JB\] I doubt I can do better, but in some points at the game it is important to count. Reducing here is not enough to win.
Territory balance is favoring black by 14 points if you play like this, and I do not see a place for white to make so many points.

So a stronger attack or invasion is needed.

L16 may give you about 7 points and give black sente, so it is not enough.
H3 is a good point but again not enough.
Invading F12 directly is not enough but, if successful, will put you closer.]
;B[di]C[[JB\] Since now on, if black does not do a big mistake, he should win.]
;W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh];W[fd];B[fe];W[gh];B[gg];W[hh];B[ih]
;W[hg]C[PM:  I think a lot of my plays here were small, but I was pretty sure I could keep sente]
;B[hf];W[fg]C[JB: this is a mistake, see variation (black missed the G11 point)]

(;B[gf];W[eg];B[dh];W[de];B[df];W[gi]C[PM:  Until I remembered I had to fill in here.  Still, I was feeling pretty confident that I could make some points around F8 and L8 while still cutting down the amount of territory black has on the bottom.

[JB\] Notice my previous count at move 91. You can add 5 points around F8 and 4 around L8, and I did not count too much for the bottom. Black got 1 point less here at the center, but he has sente.
I agree you are closer, but getting the THREE goals you mention is quite optimistic...]
;B[ik]C[[JB\] Now getting both L8 and F8 looks quite difficult...]
;W[in]C[[JB\] This one is a neutral move... no points, and no attack]
;B[jo];W[jn];B[kk]
(;W[lk]C[[JB\] a small point, black can try in other place: E16 (sente and maybe some trick), G2 (big!)...
H3 may be a good point for you, see previous variation 2.]
(;B[lj]C[JB: bad point: does not increase territory, does not attack, does not invade... a move in neutral territory]
;W[ll];B[mj];W[kl];B[jk];W[gk];B[gm];W[gn];B[hl];W[fm];B[ho]
C[JB: it is better to close the big hole at the bottom side  (jump from E2)]
;W[gl];B[hm]
(;W[gr]C[PM:  Is there a better invasion to make here?  This wasn't as profitable as I thought it would be.

JB: H2 may work, this is a reduction. At first sight there are weakness at L3/N3, but the ko at M5 helps black.
I added a couple of variations at H2 and H3 that may work.]
