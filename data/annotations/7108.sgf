C[Hi.
Thanks for reviewing my game. I was white.
I have added some questions and comments in the SGF. I think my fuseki was bad and that I won because black was too cautious in the middle game. Am I correct ?]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[oc];W[pj]C[Approaching a corner (Say, top left) instead of playing a side extension here may help you feel like you've covered more ground without allowing your opponent to take too large a moyo]
;B[cn]
(;W[fq];B[dj]
(;W[fc]C[I'm not a fan of such a low facing stone with a 4-4 and 4-10 on the other side. A higher line can be more active against allowing your opponent too mighty a moyo]
;B[hc]
(;W[cc]C[Maybe f15 was better than c17 ? Black has built a nice wall facing d10 with c16 to g15...

-See variation];B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[fb]C[I dislike this sequence simply because it begs for W enclosure, while already on a board where B is making strong moyo.]
;B[ge]
(;W[qn]C[This is bad. 

This is passive, gote, small and it does not really take the corner. If you want the corner, you want P3, R3, or R5, typically. 

This is too slow to be effective at taking influence, and too far to take territory.
See variation for the ko]
(;B[kq]
(;W[nq]C[3-3 invasion at Q3 is still ko
Pushes B towards your Weakest group in the area rather than your strongest]
;B[hq];W[cp]C[If R3 wasn't ko I'd be fine with this. 
Your lower right, though, is very much overconcentrated for not being secure.]
;B[en]
(;W[qg]C[This just feals so darned passive];B[og]C[Black had a big moyo at the west and the north. So I tried to invade the "weakest" one the best I could. Was my thought correct 

This feels very agressive by black.];W[jc]TR[pc][fj][ho]C[Where to invade ?

This is a good spot to start
Other options are marked

One thing to note is you have more probable territory, B has more moyo. If you can limit the growth of B through the center, limit profit for B there, you will be in fine shape.]
;B[hd];W[ib];B[hb];W[mb]C[I would rather see you higher here. B has a lot of power radiating through the center. By playing low, you play into B's strength becomming B's territory.]
;B[md]
(;W[ld];B[le];W[kd];B[jf]TR[cg][eg][gg][ig][ci][ei][gi][ii]
C[ You've heard the saying small life is worse than death sometimes... 

 I don't like this field position for W
There's aji in B's shape on those attacking stones, but the neighboring area is inconsequential]
;W[kb]C[Black seems to be so strong now...

Add to that that this is gote and topside is a total loss]
(;B[nj]C[ A little too greedy

Extended knights jump is cuttable. It is near W strength, and it bites off a bigger and harder to confirm moyo

And now B's playing too agressively. It's a won game for B if he starts locking down anything
And W is getting (rightly) desperate];W[lo];B[jo];W[jn];B[ko]
;W[kn]
(;B[ln]C[This is bad for B. There is no true reason for B to make this sort of cut. It is too aggressive, it invites bad shape, and it invites a L&D fight too near B's moyo (Without B actually doing anything to protect said moyo)]
;W[mo];B[lm];W[in];B[gp];W[fp];B[go];W[gn];B[fn];W[mk]C[Good threat on B's cutting stones]
;B[nk]C[B's idea to cut everything is a good way to turn a game where B has advantage into a dragon hunt where game can be decided by L&D. B isn't playing too passive in the endgame, B is attacking too much.]

Sliding away as in the normal game line gives B more influence on the left side, and the ideal extension from D16 to D10.
