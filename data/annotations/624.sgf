GC[Joel,
thanks for the game.  As always I learned a lot by thinking about where I would play and why, as I played through your game.  This go teaching ladder is a learning ladder for me, too!

I think (for my strength) I am relatively good at openings and endgames and weaker at the tactics of fighting, so please do take any of my comments on tactics with a big grain of salt (and let me know if you have any differing opinions, I'm happy to give things more thought!)

To me the biggest key moments in the game were white's trouble handling the bottom right corner (white didn't get a moyo, didn't coordinate with the adjacent stones), and black's trouble making good use of the invasion of white's weak lower side (black didn't get an attack, didn't use the power of the adjacent stones).

I hope my comments (particularly on the opening) are useful for you. Do let me know if you have any questions (in the future, when submitting games for review, it's often helpful to see what you were thinking about, so you can insert your own comments and questions before sending it off for review).

Thanks again for the interesting game to think about.

AB[pd][dp];W[pp];B[dd];W[fq];B[dn];W[jp];B[qn]C[This move by black is not my style for a handicap game.  I would prefer to defend at C10 to keep the game simple, aiming at D2 for later.]
;W[ql]C[This tight pincer by white looks like a reasonable idea.  In a handicap game, it's good to look for influence in the opening, to counter the influence of black's handicap stones.]
;B[qq]C[See variation B for the move I would play at this point.]

(;W[qp]C[R4 looks like the wrong direction.  The K4 stone won't be well placed now,and the R8 stone is too close.  White doesn't get much territory, and the thickness will be overconcentrated.]
;B[pq];W[oq]C[See variation B for the normal joseki moves here.]

(;B[rq]C[Black is trying to trick white, but actually is giving white a chance to make up for the previous mistake!  White can just connect at P4 and get a big lower side again.  Black gets S4, then, but white can Q6 or R11 to defend the R8 stone, so it's no big deal.  The k4 stone makes the lower side big for white, so white should take it!]
;W[rp]C[This looks a little dangerous...];B[op]C[...and black steers for complications.
I'm not sure what's best for white now.  It's a tough position.  Does Q2 work?  It's too hard for me to read out.  O3?  It's tough to survive Q5 ... R6 is in just the right place, the "center of three stones", to make white suffer here.]
;W[pn]C[Q6 looks like letting black off the hook, giving up the P3 stone too easily, but I don't know if there was anything better...]
;B[oo];W[po];B[nq];W[or];B[nr]C[Compare this to the variation where white bloacked at Q3.  Generally the rule of thumb is to block on the side where you can make the most territory (the widest extension) and chase black toward your strength (the closest extension).]
;W[pf]C[This is probably about all you can do to make use of the position on the lower right, but already this game looks tough for white.  H3 is a severe invasion for black later.  The mistakes in the bottom right were probably worth 1 or 2 more handicap stones...  Will you be able to exploit the aji of O4 to do anything useful?  Probably not, with only two liberties.]
;B[nd];W[ci]C[being behind, I would try something more aggressive as white (like C8) but that could backfire with that H3 weakness.

P6 is a big point for white, or O7 (O7 is where black would play locally, too)]
;B[ck];W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd]C[With exchanges flowing smoothly like this, white will have a hard time catching up.  Both sides are playing reasonably for these last few moves.]
;W[dk]C[The upper side is more urgent than this move.  Black can just calmly pull back to C8 and make his group safe.]
;B[cj]C[But black likes to fight!  C10 feels like a bit of an overplay for black.]
;W[dj];B[dl];W[el]C[Does cutting at C8 work?  I guess it's not necessary.]
;B[dm];W[jc]C[K17 is big, but defending those cutting points seems more urgent.  K17 first, before the D9 maneuver, would be better I think.  H17 might be better than K17, too.  Black's upper right is strong, since it can R14 any time, so better to try to approach the upper left.]
;B[hq]C[White certainly has his hands full now, with black having strengthened himself at D7.]
;W[hp];B[iq]C[Black plays way too submissively here.  Black is strong on both sides, so fight!    G4 maybe?  Even J4?]
;W[ip];B[gq];W[gp];B[fr];W[eq];B[jq];W[kq];B[kr];W[lq]C[this exchange is clearly good for white, who gained a lot of center strength and can reduce black's corner territory, while black took only a few points on the side that wasn't really white's anyway.]
;B[lr];W[eo];B[em]C[With white's stones below this side group has gotten a little weak.  Black can't play around D3/D2 without hurting the lower side group, so instead tries to split white and hurt the group either above or below.]
;W[fl];B[fm];W[do];B[co]C[The D5/C5 exchange seems to only reduce white's liberties and solidify black, but maybe I'm missing something....C4 is a threat now, I guess ... but white's group above will be hurt.]
;W[cp];B[gl]C[G8 is too slow.  F10 would be a more severe attack.  White can defend at F10 now and make this upper group strong.]
;W[gm]C[This cut might be an overplay by white ... the whole game is turning into a free-for-all now.  White gained so much outward power by black's ill-executed invasion on the lower side that this kind of fighting move might well work now.  But white's shape above is really bad.  F10 first, then fight later.]
;B[di]C[Black exploits the defect in white's shape nicely.]
;W[ek]C[Two empty triangles with one move!  This is getting ugly.  That's why G7 was an overplay.]
;B[ei];W[gk];B[hl]C[If white captures here, then it's a big big loss for black; white gets all the power in the center, and O7 and O14 become big moyo-making moves.]
;W[hk]C[almost necessary to avoid capture...];B[bp]C[If black captures C12, he is alive anyway, and also gets a good attck on the C/D 14 stones, so B4 is too slow, gives white a chance to play C12.

Actually now that I look at it, doesn't J8 work for white?  That's even much bigger than the whole white group on the upper left, that would really dominate the center.]
;W[cq]C[Answering in the corner is territorially big but not worth a move will all the action further up the side (attack and defense are more urgent than the corner territory I think)]
;B[bq];W[cn]C[Throws away some potential ...unless you see a way of using it that I'm missing?  Don't play C6 until you're sure it's better than B5 (for instance, if you play B2 later, you might like B5 more).]
;B[bo];W[cl];B[bl];W[il]C[All the maneuvering on the left side is peanuts compared to these stones in the center.]
;B[ff]C[White doesn't come out too badly in this trade!];W[bi]
C[It's probably an overplay to try to save these stones immediately.  Play C17 for a swap,or just play O14 to make a big moyo in the center, or do something with the K17 stone ... if black wants to spend an extra move to lkill these stones, let him.]
;B[bf];W[bg];B[be];W[bk];B[cm];W[bj];B[dh]C[Why does black not connect?  This lets white's weak group off the hook.  So what if he cuts at C13, that's very very small, just a couple points.]
;W[cl];AB[cg]C[White gained on this exchange too.  Black is overconcentrated capturing the two stones.

White needs to figure out how to handle the K17 stone, and try to get in O14 and/or O7 to make a big moyo in the middle.   O14 is bigger since it is farther from white's strength; O7 would be overconcentrated with respect to the vast power in the lower middle.]
;W[gc]C[This is a reasonable idea.;  Usually you don't want to play the "underneath shoulder hit" like this because it strenghtens black more than white, but here there's not much white can do in the corner and black is already overconcentrated anyway.

Still I think with white's outward power, O14 is the biggest move on the board.]
;B[fc];W[gb];B[dq]C[Black wisely doesn't waste a move on F18 at this point, goes after bigger fish.  Still O14 would be huge for black or white.]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[br]C[White is trying to save dead stones?  E2 is more interesting, creates some potential...]
;B[ar]C[Why doesn't black just connect at E2?];W[er];B[cs];W[ep]
;B[bs]C[White loses the corner stones but gets G2, which could hurt the lower side group later.]
;W[pi]C[This is too defensive; white is already strong below, and has that immense power in the center.  O14 is the bigger move, backed up by that power.]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[qe]C[Black gets safety with thsis maneuver.]
;W[rg]C[The edge is still small, compared to the center.  S13 talks about territory only, and less than 20 points in gote (or about 10 in sente, if black plays S14).  Still O14 (or maybe O13, or N13, in this shape).]
;B[pg];W[og]C[A free gift from black?  I don't see why Q13.]
;B[on]C[Black sets about reducing white's center.  P6 is slow, though.  O7 is faster, but maybe less safe with all white's strength in the area.  O6 at least?]
;W[pm]C[Q7 seems excessively submissive.  Can't P7 work fine?]
;B[om];W[ol];B[lc]C[The question to ask yourself about a move like M17 is "can I still win if I move there"?  If so, black is making his group completely safe, and it's a good move.  But if the game is still close, then M17 is questionable.  O8 might be necessary.

What's the answer to that question of the score?  white has 5ish points on top, 10+ on the left side and lower center, and 25ish on the right side.  Total 40+.

Black has 10ish in the top left corner (a lot more if he gets to play F18, but white is likely to play E18 first ... on the other hand M17 might make F18 sente for black, so it's worth more points than it looks at first glance), 14ish in the bottom left corner, 25ish on the bottm side, and another 15ish or more on the top right corner after M17 is played.  So it looks like black is 25+ points ahead after M17, so it's OK to play there, as long as he's careful about not letting white get too much in the center.]
;W[je]C[Black doesn't need to try to kill this group; just try to reduce white's center prospects while chasing it, and ideally get in moves like F18 and/or L18 while they are sente.]
;B[le];W[ge];B[gf];W[hf];B[lg]C[At this point white's center prospects are almost gone so it looks like it's going to be tough to get those 25 points.]
;W[lj]C[This move doesn't really do anything -- there's not much territory there, nor does it rescue a weak  group, nor attack a weak group of blacks.

Maybe E18 instead?  Or, since white is behind, try something risky like R17?  Or O18?]
;B[hg];W[fe];B[ee];W[gd];B[if];W[he];B[fb]C[I think the game is sealed for black after F18.  L18 is probably sente now too.]
;W[nm];B[mo];W[lo];B[mi]C[Black is just trying to keep white's center from getting too big.  N6 looks better to me, though, strenghtening the shape while poking through solidly into white's prospective center territory.]
;W[nj];B[kb];W[jb]C[6 points more of nail in the coffin, after this exchange.]
;B[ig]C[It's not even trivial for white to live here at this point.]
;W[kd];B[ie];W[id];B[ld];W[kc];B[mj]C[This is moderately big.  M18 is cash in the bank, though, and keeps some slight possibilities for messing up white's eye shape later (at least moves like L15 will be sente)]
;W[mk];B[ni];W[oj];B[rf]C[Black gets anohter big big move, S14.  Jumping in to the corner is impossible now.  At the very least you have to get moves like T17 and E17 and L18 before black cuts them off -- they are sente for white, so play them!

The timing on those moves is very tricky, to play them late enough that black does answer them, bu t early enough that black doesn't get the chance to take them away.]
;W[ph]C[I think Q12 is unnecessary, but it's getting late so maybe I'm missing something.]
;B[mn];W[ln]C[I think white should count the score carefully, and then probably resign at this point.]

;B[ki];W[jj];B[sg];W[sh];B[sf];W[ri];B[sp];W[so];B[sq];W[rn]
C[Black is getting EVERY endgame point.  T13 was his by rights after S14, since it's gote for you to play there, but T3 was another potentially big one for white, taken away.]
;B[gi];W[qc]C[That looks like raw desperation on white's part.]
;B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qd];B[pe];W[rb];B[rd]C[looks like white dies, with black so strong on the outside (top middle)]
;W[rc];B[pa]C[Even the ko doesn't work, black can just play P19 if white R19.]
;W[sd]C[This doesn't save white.];B[re];W[qa];B[oa];W[fa]C[Finally, white gets an endgame point!]
;B[ea];W[ga];B[eb];W[ch];B[dg];W[hi];B[hh];W[ji];B[jh];W[gj]
;B[fi];W[gr]C[A very big point, certainly worth playing now.

If anything, black has gained even more of a lead during the endgame, though.  Work on keeping an eye out for sente points, or points that are big and could become sente, so you get more of them (F18, L18, T3, and the like).  Sente and gote are key to the endgame (and important the rest of the time, too)

(;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo]C[Now what function is the K4 stone serving? Not really any.  And the R8 stone would be better placed at Q10 or even Q11, to be an adequate distance from white's wall.  Black should just play simply like this since white blocked the wrong way.]
))
(;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[rn];W[om]C[Look how much white stands to get on the lower side, and how little black gets in the corner, with that close-by R8 stone to block.  Now it's black's move, possibly at C10, G5, or K16.  If black doesn't G5, F5 is a good point for white (though a splitting move on the upper side at K17 might be more urgent immediately?)]
