C[Hi there

I have loosing strike for couple of days and I'm becoming desperate.

Usually I lost because of:
1. One of my big groups die
2. I put so much effort to build big moyo which my oponent reduce to minimum as I'm not able kill him within my sphere of influence

This game was the second case.

Therefore, my questions:
1. Mistake in building moyo and converting it into territory.
2. As usuall, opening.


Hello !
I'm Thomas, your reviewer (fantomas27 on kgs). In your game, i noticed one big default : you are too much focused on influence. You prefer influence and moyo building, ok, but that doesn't mean you should forget about territory.
And i know what i'm talking about, i used to play like that ! And trust me territory is important. Since you want to make a moyo at any cost, your opponent will just take territory during all the game and in the end he will just have to reduce your moyo a little bit to win easily. My advice : stop thinking bout influence for a while and look for territory you will see your games will become easier.
Don't hesitate to mail me back if you have any question !];B[qd]
C[My usuall first move, komoku...];W[qo]C[... but unexpected mokuhazushi.

fantomas : what you are saying is strange, at this stage of the  game nearly everything is playable, so you can't call any move "unexpected"]
;B[ec]C[I want to prepare this stone for pincer near n17

fantomas : i think this kind of thinking is for pros because the difference is so small so early in the game. For us, poor amateurs, it is useless to bother about this ; playing the moves you like is probably better so early.]
;W[do]C[also unusual, oponent wants two sides and ignore bottom ?

fantomas : probably your opponent plays the way he likes.];B[ci]
C[Again, I wanted to reduce influence of D5...

fantomas : looks good];W[ck]
(;B[ei]LB[cd:C][cf:B][dg:A]C[This move looks weird, when I played it... What would be better response ? A, B, C or tenuki ?

fantomas : indeed, playing on the fifth line is strange.
The rule is : aim first for the corners, then for the sides, and finally, when there is nothing left, go for the center.
Here is you are directly playing in the center while the four corners are still opened. That's why i would prefer to play the C move.
A and B leave the corner opened, so C is still the best.];W[de]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[dd];W[ee];B[fd];W[dh]C[fantomas : here, you were trying too hard, you should have simply connected.
I remember Fan HUI told me once that actually, go is a very simple game : you just have to play simple moves that stick to the basic principles and you win most of your games.
Besides, white's move is a mistake, to which you failed to answer properly ; so, as often in this kind of situation, you ended up being worse than your opponent.]
(;B[ch]C[fantomas : you should play simple moves, connecting here is fine so this move might put you in trouble (what happened in the game)]
;W[cg];B[eh];W[eg]
(;B[dl]LB[cm:A]C[fantomas : this move is not good ; before white had a weakness at A, but after this move this weakness disapears, white get stronger and get cash points while your group is not fully settled.
I think you should just have jumped in the center.];W[cl];B[dm]
;W[cm]
(;B[fk]TR[de]C[Actually, I was happy with this result... I just didn't know how to connect D8 with my bamboo joint... D9 looks fine

Is it good result as reaction to d15 ?

fantomas : first, i don't think the result up to here is that good for you because of your A move. Concerning your question about the connection, i will show you a few diagrams.]
(;W[jc];B[lc]LB[fd:A][qd:B]C[I had two groups, stronger one (A) and weaker one (B)... Therefore I wanted to push my oponent toward my strong position... Is it too optimistic ?

fantomas : no your decision is the good one, with the good reasons.]

(;B[gd];W[hd];B[he];W[id]C[I builded more strenght, so I want to attack his isolated group

fantomas : good spirit];B[fg];W[ff];B[gf];W[di];B[dj];W[dg]
;B[cj]TR[ej]C[Danger at E10, which my oponent probably missed...

fantomas : white can do nothig right now, so don't worry :-)]
(;W[fe];B[gg]LB[ge:A]C[I secured very bad aji...

fantomas : you should defitly have played at A instead];W[be]
(;B[fc]C[fantomas : this move loses many poits in the corner]
;W[gb];B[pj]LB[bd:A][ge:B][od:C]C[.. and played tenuki, as I thought I'm secure now... A, B are miai (or not) ?

Second question:
As usual, I want to reduce influence of r5 stone and also build moyo. is this the right move ?

fantomas : first answer : concerning the safety of you corner, yes A ad B or miai ; but A make you lose many points, so when white plays A you have to play B and so you lose points for free, so they are not miai.
second answer : i think protecting the upper right corner with C is more important because you don't have a lot of points while white has many points in the lower left corner.]
;W[pl];B[ol]LB[id:A]C[fantomas : this move is clearly bad, after that white will get a lot of points for free again while you have no actual points yet. Besides, the white A group]
;W[pm];B[ok]TR[gf][fg][gg][eh][ei][pj][fk][ol][dm]C[Weird but true...

It looks like nice moyo, but there are lot of open spaces... moreover, the lower side is still no man's land...

fantomas : true, looks nice at first sight but there are a lot of holes where white can play. Besides, still no points for black, that's why i don't like that much the idea to build a moyo here.]
;W[nd];B[le];W[jf];B[lg]C[Using influence to build moyo...

fantomas : only choice.];W[qc]C[What now ?

fantomas : A looks more normal but in this situation i can't be sure which move is better. The few variations you showed looks good for you but there may be a way for white to settle more easily.]

(;B[ln]C[Again, expanding my moyo, although my oponent is pushed to building moyo too...

fantomas : this move is the wrong direction. Your opponent played too close to your wall, so you should use your influence to attack him. it may be the loosing move.]
;W[jp];B[dq];W[cq];B[dp];W[cp];B[eo];W[dn];B[hp]C[Is this the right attack? Attacking while building territory...

fantomas : yes, it is right to attack but you should have done it sooner]
;W[jn]LB[en:A][iq:B]C[What now with this jump ? I have overwhelming strength in the center, how to use it ?

If white jumps to A, I'm ready to sacrifice...

fantomas : with this move, white wants to invade the center at all cost. you have no choice but to try to kill him that's why i would play B.]
