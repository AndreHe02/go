C[pmurk:
 I have recently entered 14k rang on IGS and had problems to cope with my openent here. I lost due to a silly mistake at the end but I want to know where I could have played better. My comment have the prefix black. During the game I had the feeling that I had to react to W moves too often.

Thank you for taking the time to review.

Pandau:
Hi pmurk,

my name is Pandau. I will do my best. I hope my review will help you to get stronger.]

;B[pa];W[na];B[qb];W[lb];B[ie]SQ[fc]C[black: is this ok or should I secure the territory with a play around F17?

Pandau:
this move is absolutely fine to secure your territory. F17 would be too passive in my sense of go. J15 is a good move.]
;W[me];B[nd];W[md];B[ph];W[ng];B[pg];W[ne]TR[cn][qn]C[Pandau:
White O15 is super slow and gote. there is no need for black to answer at this point. black should take a big point and approach to one of white corner stones. I prefer approaching from outside without any other stones around.]
;B[pe];W[nc]C[black: I do not think I can kill W group, so a try to build something on the left side

Pandau:
This is another slow move of white. The white group has already an eye, has good enough shape to build his second eye and has access to the middle of the board. Consider this group as alive, but keep in mind that it has still just one eye. With this fact in mind you can think about how to force him to build his second eye by profiting from the attack while doing so.

Of course not now. Your idea to follow another strategy is absolutely reasonable.]
;B[cn];W[gq]LB[dj:C][bp:A][cp:D][cq:B]C[Pandau:
I will not go into joseki, since you can look them up. More important to know is, which strategy are you following? And can you figure out, which strategy your opponent is following?

Try to answer these questions and try to find a joseki which suits your strategy. This way you can't say you picked a wrong joseki. There are always several suitable and unsuitable josekis for one's strategy.

A: keeps everything simple
B: take some territory and give influence to your opponent
C: keep youself flexible and let your opponent decide
D: Attaching stones will always get strong, for both sides.

Personally, I don't like A because it gives your opponent a little bit more then he deserves for the sake of simplicity.]
(;B[cp]SQ[dj][cq][iq]C[black: brugo says: not correct - possible continuations are marked which I did not know at the time playing.

Pandau:
With the attachement you have to ask yourself. Do I want to strengthen my opponent's stone to make myself stronger?]
;W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[dk];W[cg]LB[bf:A][cf:B][df:C]C[black: where to play: corner or C6 group? In the review I think the corner would habe been better, in the game I chose to defend the side group and then to attack.

Pandau:
A good guideline for me is to play away from strength and play from the weaker side. This would induce you to play from the corner because you already made your D9 group strong. There is not a lot of space to attack. So where to play, if from the corner?]
(;B[ci];W[eg];B[ee];W[bh];B[bi];W[ai];B[aj];W[ah];B[bj];W[bf]
TR[dg]C[black: W seems to like this figure: is this a good shape? Can this be attacked?

Pandau:
The tiger's mouth is one move to defend a cut and is a faster variation as the solid connection. Since there was nothing to cut and white played it only to create an eye for himself, you can say white's play is very slow.

To peep at those one point jumps is a good way to take the shape out of your opponent.]

(;B[ro];W[qn];B[rn];W[rm];B[sp];W[qs];B[rs];W[ps]TR[qb][bj]
[sr]C[Pandau:
Again, If you need to live because your group is already enclosed, then a tiger mouth will do the living. Usually the solid connection is the best way to connect. But not if you need eyes for living.]

[sq][sr][ss]C[black: I was unsure if I should play on the third or fourth line

Pandau:
This question is an important one to ask. You can follow the general guideline, which says: 4th line for influence and 3rd for territory. There is now THE best move, but many best answers for different styles or strategies. Are you territorial, influencial or a crazy player?

Black seems to be territorial here, and white maybe tries to live small but has potential in the middle. The only weak group for black is in the bottom. Black has to be careful. Maybe J3 would be more safe then J4.]
;W[ir];B[kr]C[Pandau:
Too slow... White still can take your eyeshape away. So it is better to invest the move in getting to the middle faster.]
(;W[do];B[qk]CR[qm][rm][qn][qo]TR[ip][kq][nq][kr]SQ[qh][rh]
[sh][qi][ri][si]C[black: this is low - giving me territory but later in the game I learned that W grap some territory. Should I have played higher?

Pandau:
Think about the value of this move. You secure about 6 points of territory. My guideline for decisions where to pla is:

1.) Are there weak groups?
2.) Are there big points?

your marked stones could get under severe attack easily. But if you are looking for territory, then the 3rd line is perfect, although you played a little bit too close to white's thickness. R10 would be better, since your R9 can't really threaten the white group and therefor is aiming at territory only.]
;W[np]TR[ip][kq][nq][kr]C[the marked stones are still under severe attack. Don't underestimate the annoyingness of being pushed around by an attacking opponent.]
(;B[nr]MA[ip][kq][nq][kr]C[black: the variation seems much stronger but leaves the marked groupd weka

Pandau:
Indeed, helping your weak stones, if you don't want to sacrifice them is never a bad thing to do.]

(;B[rk];W[ok];B[ni];W[kf]TR[ip][kq][nq][kr][nr]C[Pandau:
White is still behind. The only hope for white is to attack the marked stones somehow and profit from the attack. So don't let white get an easy attack on these stones.]

So what would be the invasion? Aren't black and white already sharing the middle?]
;B[lm];W[ll];B[km];W[mm];B[mn]LB[ln:A]MA[ko][mp]C[black: seems wrong - maybe on the marked spots?

;W[ap];B[bo];W[mi];B[nh]C[black: should I just leave this stone and protect with - lets say the top left?
Is there a way to invade/ reduce the lower left?

I don't understand your first question. Your top left is secure.
No way to invade lower left. That is not a good question to ask. this is almost endgame. And in Endgame the weaknesses come into account. It requires good reading, nothing someone can teach you but yourself by solving life and death problems.]

You played well. I would say getting better at reading will be the most effective way for you to improve. And of course playing a lot of games. In a strategic sense your opponent was weaker than you. So I couldn't really figure out if you have any leaks in your strategic play. I guess it's good enough for your strength. Playing and reading is most important.]
