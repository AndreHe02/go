Hi Kelly,
I am Sen, my last rank on KGS was about 3k or so.
Currenly I am only playing on DGS about 5k.
I will be glad to answer your questions and offer some of my views too.
If you have further questions you can email me back.

So I shall begin the review..];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq]
;W[qk]
(;B[qm]LB[de:A][qg:B]C[*This felt like a mistake. I think I should have maybe tenukied at A. Later on, maybe force white to settle with a move at B instead?

This is a perfectly good move. 
While a move at A is also viable option it really depends on your game plan.
A move at A is more on the attacking style while your move at R7 is more territory orientated with a possibility of attack on the white group too.
Personally I would play the way you played.

See variation on alternative opening];W[qh];B[qf]C[too slow?


This is not wrong but you must know the intention is to attack the white group and try to extend out in the middle when attacking the white group making big moyo.]
;W[ci]
(;B[de]C[Is this approach playable with the Chinese Opening?

Yes it's a standard approach.
However you must consider the black stones at the other side of the board.

See variation];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb]LB[bb:A][cd:B]
(;B[bb]CR[cd]C[Mistake, Joseki is marked with circle. See Variation for question

Yah bad move to be trap in a tiny corner..];W[cd];B[bc];W[dd]
;B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[cg]LB[bd:A]TR[be]C[Is A better for White?

Yes A is better.
At D13 its low efficiency and there is a loop hole at A which black can crawl at A or jump at B15 which will reduce the W territory by a lot.]

(;B[jp]TR[fq]C[Here might be better to be more aggressive a bit and approach the lower left corner.]
;W[kc]
(;B[ld]TR[kc][qh][qk][fq]SQ[pd][qf]C[The aim here was to begin to put pressure on all of the marked stones. Is this the right idea?

For me I would tenuki as the marked stone aren't really very good at securing the corner.
I would develop the bottom moyo instead at F3];W[pc]C[W is pretty aggressive]
;B[oc];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[nb]C[carefull as W can choose to eat the other side.]

(;W[pb];B[nd];W[rd];B[re];W[rb]

In this case it would be better to approach from the other side.]

(;B[rl]C[Wrong direction.];W[ql];B[rn];W[pm];B[qn];W[rk];B[sm]
C[seems like white's group is already too comfortable, was there a better way to put pressure here? Or, more likely, am I fixating too much on this one group here?

Problem is you have no aim when you attacking.

When attacking you can
1) Kill a group - not really possible in this case
2) Attack it in a direction you want it to move so that you can build your own moyo or territory.

2 is more common form of attacking.

In your case you are just.... making small territory];W[gq]
C[White has snatch the sente to occupy the big point.]
(;B[cq]LB[cp:A]C[Maybe A is a better invasion?

Yes A is better.];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[eo]

[pm][lo]C[Thought briefly about playing at A, but white would just jump out and connect with his group on the right.

B dont really have a good answer for this invasion.
If you block the top part the potential is limited due to the presence of marked W group

If attack at A, W will jump at  M5 and connect with the marked group. So either way B isn't too good.]

Once it's very thick you can continue to attack the white group

You haven't seal it in yet and you attack the inside?

You played well here
One point to note here is that you have sealed white in completely before killing the group.
Light the group at right center side you try to kill it but have not even sealed it in that is why you werent too good there.]
