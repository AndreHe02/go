;B[no];W[np];B[mm];W[nl];B[kj];W[jl];B[kh];W[jh]C[inthorie has resigned the game.

* Both players missed that E17 could be captured for a long time, so for a long time the game was kind of weird.

* Both players played rather loose and left a lot of aji. I think they should try to play more tight and not care for each and every point.

* I suggest to look for possible captures more carefully. E17 and the black center group at move 93 are very important.

* Black should then try to spot these captues in advance and avoid them by playing better shapes.

* Judging from his questions, black seems to have an idea of better shapes, so just try and read deep and careful and you will easily avoid the mistakes of this game!]
