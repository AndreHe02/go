Hi my name is Justin.  I am a ~5 kyu on KGS, and I will do my best to give you suggestions for your game :)]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dq];B[qe];W[cj];B[qi];W[qn];B[mq];W[rp]

(;B[iq]C[Justin: Here I would play R3 instead of J3.  The R6-S4 group is not alive yet, and it is basically an invasion into your sphere of influence.  You want to attack this group and a move like J3 just allows him to play R3 and get a base.  One of the key points of attacking is denying your opponent a base (space for two eyes).  

See my variation.];W[jc];B[co]C[Again, I believe attacking the white group in the lower right is more important, but this is still OK.]
;W[cm];B[cq];W[dp];B[cp];W[gq]C[Justin: Here I recommend D5, to cut whites group off from the top group.  After that, his group has to fend for itself against both your corner group (which is basically alive) and your bottom group.  See my variation.]

(;B[dr];W[er]
(;B[br]C[Justin: C2 looks better since it saves a point and is more solid.  White cannot kill you.]
;W[eo];B[cc]C[Justin: I believe this is the ideal time to invade since white put it K17 and C10.  Good job.]

;W[bl];B[ch];W[dh];B[ai]C[Justin: Sadly, your B12 group is not alive after this move, I think.  See variation for my killing variation.  (Look at it yourself as a Life/Death Problem, with you playing the White side before you look at my answer).]

(;W[mc];B[rm]C[Justin: I think R3 is still the right move to attack that group, but you have the right idea!]
;W[rn]
(;B[qk];W[qm];B[rl];W[qq]C[:(  This move is big and it also makes white strong.]

(;B[pr];W[pq];B[oq];W[qr];B[or];W[op]C[Now white is attacking you instead of the other way around.]
;B[np]C[Justin: Good move for shape.];W[oo]
(;B[ol]C[Justin: I would be concerned about your bottom groups stability.  White is already alive, and your side top group is very stabile, so I would probably play a move around J5 instead.]
;W[ih]C[White is being a little too conservative I think.  Somewhere around K10 looks good as well.  You are probably behind by about 10 points here, so you have to play aggresive moves to catch up.]

(;B[je]C[Justin: See my suggestions for what look like better moves to me.]
;W[ie];B[if];W[id];B[ge]C[Justin: Woah.  You need to let your opponent have that territory.  A move like M14 is more light and will easily reduce your opponent's territory here.]
;W[hf]C[Now you are cut.];B[gd];W[jf];B[dg];W[cf];B[eg]C[You have no space for eyes here, although your determination is admirable :)  I would not try to win in this way.  Simple reduction and good endgame could get you caught up.  You are only losing by 10 points before these moves, remember... now you might be losing by much more if he kills you.]
;W[gf];B[ff];W[fe];B[fd];W[ee];B[no];W[fg];B[on];W[po];B[ho]
C[Justin: Good.  Personally I would go with J5, but this seems good too.  You have evened out the score a little bit with these moves.  If you can develop your top right moyo, you can probably win.]
;W[eh]C[White is spending way too many unnecessary kiling moves on your "decoy" group here.  He is letting you win.]

(;B[og]C[Justin: See variations for my suggestions for this moyo.]
;W[mg];B[ne]C[Justin: the game is pretty close.  hard to tell who is winning.]
;W[me];B[nd];W[md];B[nc];W[oi]
(;B[ph];W[pj];B[qj]C[Justin: You are letting him push you around.]
;W[nh]C[There are some big opportunities here.  You have sente.  See variations for some suggestions.]

(;B[ok]C[Justin: Much too small I think.  Try to find big, double sente and sente moves in endgames.]
;W[nj];B[oj];W[pi];B[oh];W[fl];B[gn]C[Justin: I don't really understand this move.  Much bigger sente moves are on the board.]
;W[fn];B[hr]C[Good... big point, but gote.  Take other sente points first and then return to this one.]
;W[gr];B[hq]C[Gote again.];W[ao]
(;B[an]C[Justin: This doesn't work.  Check my variation.];W[bn]

(;B[bo];W[ap];B[aq];W[ds]
(;B[cr];W[am];B[cs];W[es];B[bp];W[an];B[as]C[Justin: very unnecessary.  You already have 2 eyes.  Wasting moves like this can lose games very easily.  I strongly suggest you work on life/death problems everyday if you can, so that you can save yourself moves in games like this :)]
;W[gb];B[ll];W[mk];B[hk];W[ij];B[hj];W[hi];B[gk];W[fj];B[fk]
;W[ek];B[fm];W[em];B[gm];W[nb]C[This is very big.];B[ob];W[na]
;B[oa];W[lb];B[dn];W[en];B[dm];W[dl];B[gl];W[el];B[fp]C[I will stop commentary here.  

You played well in several places.  But I strongly recommend you practice the following things:

1) Do a few life/death problems everyday.  This will make you almost 2-3 stones stronger very quickly.  A lot of 10kyu and below mistakes come with groups dying or unnecessary moves being played where a group is already alive.

2) Look at endgame problems.  Keeping sente here and in other parts of the game is very important.  

3) Practice the 3-3 invasion joseki which I give in my variation earlier.  This is so important that you must know it by heart, without even thinking about it.

Good luck in your future games!
