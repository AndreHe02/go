gedh 8k*: hello :)

===

aga: I played this game at NNGS (I'm aga there). H3/K-4.5 was set according to NNGS 'sug' command that suggest how to setup game so both players had equal chances to win. Time limits were set up to 5/20.

aga: I lost this game by a small margin - only 2.5 pts. But that's not a problem. Even more, I could lose this game by more than 15 pts but my opponent made yose mistake. But that's still not a problem. The problem is that I don't see which my moves (or strategical plans) were unreasonable. So, I'm submitting this game to be reviewed in hope to get an idea what I did wrong and how to improve. Thanks in advance.]
;W[pp];B[nq]C[
gedh 8k*: you too];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[kq];W[fc]LB[ql:a]C[aga: One time I was suggested about a similar situation by a dan player that finishing joseki with wR10 is a fair game flow. But in handi game I feel that would be slow. Additionally, bD4 and bL3 stones are working good together. Being not sure how to play around bD4 stone I decided to play some moves elsewhere and decide how to handle bD4 area a bit later.

I would still suggest W R9/10.   There is still a long way to go...

If W insists to play F17, Q6 should be positioned at R6 to avoid giving B a good point - 'a'.]
;B[hc]C[aga: Actually, I havn't considered tight pincer here, without black stone around c10. But it probably better for me than extending along top allowing b to extend towards bD4.]
;W[fe];B[df]C[
mikka started observation.];W[id]LB[kd:a]C[I would prefer a pincer at 'a' to make the game more complicated for B.]
;B[ic];W[jd];B[hd];W[he];B[jc];W[kd];B[lc];W[gd]LB[gf:a]C[aga: AFAIR, this is joseki. I suppose, some w influence allows w to approach bD4 stone from left, and then invade or reduce bottom moyo with something like j3.

My personal preference is W G15 instead, to avoid 'a', W needs to respond at G15 which makes G16 looks like a dame (a zero-value move).]
;B[ld]C[aga: this move makes right side big for both players, so I [feel to\] obligated to play there immediatelly.]
;W[pf];B[lf]C[aga: I judge those 3 stones are quite small now, thus bM14 can be ignored.

B M14 a slow move...   For me I would choose to play B R15...   It is more realistic... Don't you think?]
;W[qd];B[qc];W[qe];B[pc]LB[rc:a]C[B Q17 still better at S17, it provides a yose (end-game) move at T14.]
;W[qj]C[aga: Although in gote, I have built nice framework at the right side.

Yes, I can't agree more, you are right.

Now B14 looks inefficient.];B[ie]C[B J15 a slow move, worth only 8 points.   I would prefer B C10/D10 to build a framework on the left.]
;W[if]LB[ch:a]C[Another option for W is H14, B R14.

In this way W can get a sente to play 'a'.];B[je];W[jf];B[ke]
;W[kf];B[le];W[hf]C[aga: Again gote, but I trying to keep thickness faced down.

No choice, this cut is very critical.   I would play the same, if I were you.]
;B[ch]C[aga: This the first move that makes bD4 stronger. So, I must play at bottom left now.

B C12 is inefficient.   With W C17 open and a thick wall in the middle, B D11 better.]
;W[dn];B[fp];W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[ck]C[aga: I was expecting bB3 here, but b again does not plays such a big move

It is still more advisable for B to play B3 (W C9 next), the corner is very substanial.

B is more than 25 points ahead.];W[bq];B[cr];W[ip]C[aga: My leftmost group is still a bit weak, but it's shape allows to live locally or run toward w thickness.

Sad to say, W J4 is a bad move.   Its purpose is to take away some points from B but the price is that it created 2 weak pieces, if B plays B2...

W B2 is still a better choice, settle down first, then see how... i.e. wait for the lower-hand to make mistakes...]
;B[gn];W[br]C[Sensible move for W.];B[ko];W[in];B[km];W[il]
;B[gl];W[ij]C[W managed to connect the weak piece to the wall somehow...   But I would suggest W H9, B G9 and W H11 to connect solidly.

The reason being the thinness around J7 and J9...];B[pk]LB[bn:a]
[bm:b][cm:c][cn:a][bl:b][bo:f][am:g][bs:h]C[B can choose to fix the left-hand side using the sequence 'a' to 'h' (B 'a', W 'b', so on so forth), then play Q9.]
;W[qk];B[pl];W[ql]LB[pm:a][qm:b][on:c][oo:d][nn:e]C[Why not fix the shape using the sequence 'a' to 'e' to simply the situation?]
;B[mk];W[jn];B[kn]C[aga: ok, I managed to finish reduction in sente, so now some other big point...]
;W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[cd];W[cb]C[W B18, B B17 and WC18 better, but this is trivial.]
;B[rc]LB[hq:a][iq:b][hr:c][ir:d][pm:e][qm:f][on:g][oo:h][nn:i]
C[aga: As I can judge this moves shows that bQ17 was wasted.

Yes, I agree with you.

The winning sequence here for B is from 'a' to 'i'.   Fix all the problems and win the game.]
;W[gq]C[aga: probably, not the ideal move since it forces b to play bF3 that protects d3 cut, but I feel this area is too big to let b to play there first.]
;B[gp];W[hq];B[fq]C[
mikka started observation.];W[gk]LB[di:a][ci:b][dk:c]C[Sorry, I don't quite agree with this move...

With W D2 aji to make use of...

I would play W 'a' to 'c' to separate the two B pieces first and hope to gain from something from the attack.]
;B[ho];W[jp];B[kp]LB[gr:a][hr:b][er:c]C[B L4 not necessary now.

B can simply play 'a' to 'c' to settle down first.];W[fk]C[Good move, separated the 2 B pieces.]
;B[fr];W[dr];B[dq];W[cs];B[er];W[ds];B[bs];W[as];B[es];W[bs]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[gs]LB[en:a][em:b][fn:c]C[Well... B 'a' to 'c' a better way.

But B G1 still do the job to stay alive...];W[eo]C[aga: I suppose b is undefinitelly alive now, so I play light stone to improve connection with wF9 stone]
;B[ep];W[dj];B[cj];W[eh]C[aga: It's usually a problem for w in handi games: where to take enough territory to compete with cautious b player. I got some in the very center, and I'm quite happy.

Sorry to disagree, W S16 is biggest point (anti-sente 9 points, equivalent to 18 points gote).]
;B[sf];W[rf];B[se];W[sd]C[W T13 better.

You lost 2 points here.];B[rd];W[sg];B[re];W[rg];B[qr]LB[bn:a]
[bm:b][cm:c][cn:d][bl:e][bo:f][am:g][ao:h]C[Game over at this point.

(Though B can play 'a' to 'h' first to lock out all the chances for W and then play R2.)]
;W[rr];B[bn];W[bo];B[cm];W[pq];B[or];W[np];B[mp]C[
knick started observation.];W[lg]LB[gb:a]C[Better to play 'a' first.

The center is always smaller than it seems.];B[mg];W[lh];B[mh]
LB[gb:a]C[B still to play 'a', W have to respond with B16.]
;W[nf]LB[gb:a]C[I still have to emphasize the point  'a'.

No cut at N14, B can N11.];B[of];W[og];B[oe]C[Good moves by B.]
;W[ng];B[mf]C[No cut as mentioned early, so this move is considered as dame.]
;W[gb]C[Finally...];B[hb];W[bd];B[be];W[ac];B[pm];W[qm];B[no]
C[B O6 would have made some points in the center.];W[on];B[nn]
C[Isn't B O7 better?];W[om]C[
 ronin909 started observation.];B[nm]C[B O8 better.];W[oj];B[nk]
;W[pj]LB[ne:a][nd:b][ae:c][bf:d][af:e][ag:f][ad:g][cg:h][jr:i]
[kr:j]C[W Q10 Losing move?

If W to play 'a' to 'j', then W S1, though W is still behind by 6-7 points, it is not over yet.]
;B[rs]C[aga: I wonder why b hadn't eventually protect bQ9 stones - those 6 points are not so small in yose.

aga: Anyway, counting shows that w is behind by more than 10 pts, and it looks hard to catch up in the endgame. With b having sente.

S1 still bigger than Q10...];W[sr];B[kj];W[ji];B[eg];W[fg];B[hl]
;W[ik];B[di]C[Bad shape... B D12 better.];W[ei];B[ej]LB[ao:a]
[ap:b][an:c][em:d][nl:e]C[Bad move.

B 'a' to 'e' obviously sente.];W[fj];B[dk];W[ok];B[ap]C[Misread by B.   W E8 connects beautifully...]
;W[ao];B[aq];W[el]C[B lost 4 points here.];B[hk];W[hj];B[ek]
;W[fl];B[ki];W[kh];B[ff]C[B A15 (anti-sente 4 points, 8 points gote) far bigger.]
;W[gf];B[fh];W[ef];B[dg];W[fi];B[dm];W[cn];B[bm];W[em];B[nl]
;W[ol];B[fn];W[en];B[im]C[No point... B A15 biggest.];W[jm]
;B[hm];W[kl];B[ll];W[ae];B[bf];W[af];B[ag];W[ad];B[kk];W[jl]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[oo];W[op]C[Sorry, W K2 bigger.];B[po];W[qo];B[gc]
;W[fb];B[ed];W[ee]C[Cunning move :)];B[ga]C[aga: Here b made mistake that costed him more than 10 pts. Although there are some minor mistakes I can see beyond this point,  I cannot expect my opponent will always make big errors when I'm behind :-) So, I suppose I did something wrong before this point. (And it's probably don't worth to worry about commenting moves beyond this point).

OK, I do hope you agree with what I commented previously, please feel free to consult me if you need any clarifications.
