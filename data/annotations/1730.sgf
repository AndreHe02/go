;W[pp];B[de];W[jp]LB[jd:A]C[If W wants to play on a large scale it is better to play  at A, this prevents B from expanding from his corner  enclosure]
;B[jc]C[good];W[je]C[I'd like to know if I could have reacted better to this  move.]
;B[md]C[It looks like a good idea for me to expand towards  the corner.
If you don앖 want W to get influence you also could  play at the right edge immediately.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[oe];B[of];W[ne];B[qi]C[this is a very good result for B]
;W[cn];B[dl]C[good idea to play a pincer, but to build some  potential teritorry - and that압 what you should want  here -  it 압 better to play on the third line]
;W[cl];B[ck];W[bl];B[ek]C[Seems like a good plan.  Get some wall-like figure  pointed at my corner stones.

yes, but W gets a peep now, I앇 prefer to connect  solidly]
;W[ai]C[much too early];B[bj];W[aj];B[bk];W[ak];B[bh];W[al]
;B[ah]LB[bp:A]C[Unfurtunatly, I later made a mistake here.

You don앖 have to play here now.
Does W really want to crawl on the first line while he  isn앖 even alive.  Play around A and it will be quite hard for W to live.]
;W[cp]C[very important];B[dq]C[why not hane?];W[cq];B[en]C[My thoughts are to get some influence or a wall  pointed to the right to aim an invasion along the  lines of N3 or N4

W already lives in the corner so it압 not important to  seal him in.
It is bigger to approach the lower right corner from  above, this way you not only destroy but create  some points of your own
but before you can do this you should strengthen  your two stones in the lower left. I앇 prefer to expand  at the lower edge but to try to connect as you did is  also worth thinking about]
;W[bi]
(;B[ci]C[I suggest the variation];W[ch];B[cg];W[dh];B[dg];W[bg]
;B[bf];W[ag];B[af]C[this move is much too small to play it now]
;W[di];B[eh]C[what are you both trying to do now?  The lower and the right edge are much more  interestimg now]
;C[This result turns out bad for me.  Perhaps I should  have played an extra move here to defend C12  rather than play E6


there is a W move missing !?];B[mp]LB[hq:A][qm:B]C[The promised invasion.

Your groups are too weak to attack eficiently, first  strengthen them at A or B]
;W[lq];B[qm]C[:-)];W[pn];B[ol]C[I think this is a bad move.  Could I have done better?

Your move is ok, you also could just extend];W[mn]LB[hp:A]C[Besides that, this is the start of a fight that although I  win, I was never quite sure of.  Any advice on how I  could have done things better in this corner is  greatly appreciated.


First of all, you now can see that your invasion  became very weak, because you played it too early.

Sacrifice this stone you`d only get a weak group by  defending it
besides there still is a invasion at the 3-3 point and  your left side group becomes weaker with every  stone W plays around here.
I앇 play around A.];B[oo];W[on];B[qq]C[Why not immediately?
You only strengthened W with the exchange of the  last two moves]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]C[this is the problem];B[po];W[qn];B[op];W[oq]
;B[nq];W[qr];B[pr];W[or];B[nr]
(;W[os];B[rr]C[now the game is practically over
I don앖 see a chance for W to get compensation for  this big loss.]
;W[ps];B[rs];W[ns];B[mr];W[fq]C[nevertheless still a good point]
;B[dm]MA[do][dn][eo]C[I wanted to solidify this wall to make a strong  invasion at H3 or H4, but the opponent was  apparently smarter than me.  Should I have jumped  into the invasion without this?

No!
youre leading you shouldn앖 invade at all.
eliminate your weaknesses
you could have played at any of the marked points to  connect to the center]
;W[eo]C[76 would be much stronger!];B[do];W[dn]C[apparently this one doesn앖 work]
;B[co];W[bo];B[bn];W[cm];B[bp];W[em];B[el]LB[ei:A]C[your center group is now cut off
you should connect quickly, so better play A now
you don앖  have to defend every stone];W[fn];B[bq];W[fj]C[now youre in trouble]
;B[gl]C[last way out
but perhaps give them up now instead of giving W  the chance to get back into the game by attacking a  growing weak group]
;W[gk];B[fk];W[dk]
(;B[hk]C[good idea, but see variation];W[fl];B[hl]C[Having put all my thought into my last two fights, I  was running low on time on these few moves.  I  apologise for my ineptitude.  Don't bother explaining  the obvious logic flaw in what I just did.

:-)
But it압 still a good game for you];W[dr];B[cr];W[er];B[nm]
;W[ms];B[lr]C[He could save his corner here, but chooses not to.  Is his move better than allowing my line of black along the bottom?]
;W[fh]C[you talk about this move?
It압 definitely not very big];B[kr]LB[nn:A]C[Yes, L3 would have been better.

A would be better for you];W[nn];B[hp]LB[ll:A]C[I know that this stone can retreat to one of many  different groups, so it seems like a good idea, and  turns out well.  I still have my doubts though.

I wouldn앖 invade now.
You have more teritorry AND more influence, you  have no need to attack.
But the only chance for W now is to capture your  center group on a very large scale.
You just have to defend against this, for example  play at A]
;W[mo];B[np];W[lp]C[???];B[fp]C[I only would repeat myself...]
;W[ep];B[gq];W[gr]C[I think it's whites own fault that he lost this group  with this move.

Yes];B[eq];W[fr];B[hr];W[fo];B[gp];W[hn];B[ip];W[io];B[jq];W[kp]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[in]C[I was hoping for H5, so he would keep his peices  connected nicely, and so would I.  Instead, he starts  a complicated fight that lasts till almost the end of  the game, and loses it for me.

But does your last move help to connect?
Not at all, so better connect immediately];W[ll]C[that압 the vital point]
;B[ho];W[go];B[hm];W[gn];B[hq]LB[ir:A][jr:B]C[I'm happy to have spotted the danger here, but is  there a better move I could have used to prevent it?

A defends against the cut at B too];W[jj];B[jl]C[the fight gets quite difficult now, I would have  prefered not to get in this situation at all ;-)

I won앖 comment on much of the following because I  think the early middle game is by far the most  interesting part of this game.]
;W[hj];B[kk];W[mi];B[lk];W[mk];B[ml];W[lm];B[li];W[nk];B[nl]
;W[nf];B[pl]C[Is this a wasted move?  I wanted to be sure that the  large white group could not break through here, but it  might have been a better idea to take an extra move  for my weak black group.

Trying to catch is an unnecessary risk, better defend

W is lucky with this, because without a big and  complicated fight the game is lost for him

;B[ik];W[kn];B[km];W[ij];B[kl];W[kq];B[jr];W[im];B[jm];W[mg]
;B[ie]C[At this point, I had given up on my group, hoping that  the peices at the bottom would make up for it, along  with threatening to connect while gaining territory.

If you did that earlier this would have been an easy  victory for you]
;W[if];B[gf];W[he];B[hd];W[ge];B[gd];W[ff];B[fe];W[eg];B[ef]
;W[fg];B[qc]C[This invasion goes nowhere.  Could I have handled it better?]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[pc];B[qe]LB[qb:A]C[playing at  A makes a living group, but white looks  into your teritorry at the edge]
;W[rc];B[nh];W[mh];B[ng];W[pj]C[This move is the beginning of the end.  After this  short fight I finally give up.  Could I have handled it  better?  (A common question here)

Sure , play to the right of 183];B[oj];W[oi];B[nj];W[mj];B[ni]
;W[ok];B[pi];W[pk];B[qk];W[qj];B[rj];W[rk];B[ql];W[ri];B[rh]
;W[sj];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[og]C[Black resigned.


To summarize:
You played well in the openning but soon lost the  overview and tried to defend almost every stone.

You should try not to play locally only.
Look at the status and strength of the surrounding  groups and try to estimate who is leading.

I know this sounds quite general but I hope it could  be a starting point for you.

Have a good time
