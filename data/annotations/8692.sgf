C[Hi,

I'm Florian, chevelu on KGS, should be around 1k KGS ranking. My comment and questions will start with \\m/.

I play as white in this game against a 2d and I think I could win this game without the "I'm greedy and I forgot to read" move in the yose. I don't know if I played this one  beyond my 1k or if he played below his 2d but that is not a very important point.

Because I find this game interessant and funny to play and because I'm sure there are a lot of bad moves that I don't see, I submit this game to review.

Thanks a lot

Florian \\m/

MR: 
Hi Florian,
enclosed please find my comments for the GTL review, always starting with "MR". 

I think that the decisive point of the game was that you allowed black to turn his moyo into territory (capturing the L10 stone) while in parallel not killing the black D15 group. The endgame faults only finalized the result (after your opponent being tricked in the lower left corner).

C[\\m/ : thought it was to take sente
MR: Yes, this is the idea of not playing the "very standard" P3.]
;W[nr];B[mr];W[or];B[mq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[kj]C[\\m/ : too deep ? not urgent to reduce moyo ?
MR: It *is* urgent to reduce the moyo. Your decision to invade at R3 after taking the upper right corner is very territory orientated. Players that are more afraid of opponents' moyos also consider R6 (followed be B R5, W Q6, WO4, e.g. B Q8, etc.) instead of taking the lower right corner. As your opponent was kind enough to take gote in the lower right corner, it is perfectly correct and urgent to reduce the black moyo. The particular spot also looks reasonable to me.]
;B[de];W[dh]C[MR: The choice of joseki is a bit a matter of taste (C13 would also be possible, for example), as long as you play a pincer, as the upper edge is not interesting because of N16.]
;B[cc]C[MR: The "usual" idea would be G16, because of D12 limiting the space for development on the left side (normal extension to C12 or C11 in the joseki is impossible for B).]
;W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[hd];B[he];W[id];B[ij]
C[MR: I think that it is a good idea of B to start an attack on L10, as there is no good "one move" to settle the shape for the D15 group.]
;W[ie];B[ih];W[hg]C[MR: The alternative idea would be to do something for the L10 stone / group. My feeling is that it is too large to allow black to turn his whole moyo into territory with L10 captured right in the middle.]
;B[ig];W[if];B[jk]C[MR: ? 
B should either cut at H14 or block the white route above L10.]

(;W[ff]C[MR: Not the very best move ... as you already noticed yourself.]

(;W[dg]C[MR: White should try to find a way to come out of the sequence in sente in order to help his L10 stone / not allow black to shut of his moyo.]

;W[bg];B[bi];W[bk];B[bn];W[bo]C[MR: Did you read out that you have time to block here? How about living with the white group at the upper left edge with B15?]

;B[ai];W[cg];B[jm]C[\\m/ : so here I counted, found it close and say ok, it's a yose game.
MR: Yes, you both threw back and forth bunches of points (white captured the F4 stones, black did not kill the D12 group). 

The game is now close - but you are, of course, right that in a close game, there is no room for large endgame oversights like you did in what follows. Therefore, I stop the comment here, as there is not much room for "tricking around" after the oversights.]
