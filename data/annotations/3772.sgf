C[I considered my response to this move for a while.  I wanted to choose a joseki which would expand my moyo along the topside.  But I also didn't want to make it too easy for him to reinforce his weakness of me undercutting his wall in the lower-left.  I couldn't figure out a way to achieve both objectives, so I just decided to expand my own moyo.


yip:
Right now, there isn't a moyo on the top side; it's too open.  If P17 were played at L17 or L16, it'd look more like a moyo, but since black can play anywhere on the top and live easily, white can't consider that to be potential territory at this point.]
;W[df]C[yip:
This would generally be played when white's stone is weak and needs to strengthen itself.  It seems playable here, though.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[ce];W[cd];B[cj];W[qj]LB[jc:A]C[yip:
The top is still wide open now.  If white is trying to make a moyo, then a play at A is needed.

This isn't to say that white has to play there now, but it diminshes the value of R10, since it's easy for black to invade and break up the top.

If white doesn't want to defend at A, then a more aggressive play is needed - otherwise, black can take the initiative.  Coming in around K3 would work well, for example.]

(;B[gc]C[yip:
This is premature (and not the best point - F17 is better).]
;W[ic]C[yip:
Capturing black is not realistic here.]
(;B[ge];W[ie];B[de];W[ed];B[ee];W[fd];B[gd];W[fe];B[gf];W[ff]
;B[jd];W[id];B[nc]C[yip:
Black's being overly aggressive now.  White needs to play so as to not weaken the J17 group too much.  The upper right is solid for now, so white should keep pressure on the weak black stones.]

(;W[nd]C[yip:
This approach leaves weaknesses for black to aim at later.  White should play solidly to stay on the attack and give black as little help as possible.]
;B[mc];W[md];B[lc]LB[ob:A]C[yip:
White's pushing from behind, forcing black to connect.  Black's not going to have a problem living, since A is sente.]

(;W[ob];B[od];W[pd];B[oe];W[pb];B[kd];W[lf];B[jb]
(;W[ib]C[yip:
This doesn't seem reasonable by white; black will naturally split the weak groups apart now.]
;B[kf];W[jf]
(;B[le]LB[ke:A]C[yip:
Black should just play directly at A here.];W[me];B[ke];W[mf]
;B[kg]TR[le][me]C[yip:
Note that the marked exchange here really didn't do anything for black, so it should have just been kept in reserve.]
;W[jc]C[yip:
White whould be in no hurry to play here.  It's one eye in gote, so white still needs to flee into the center.  Black won't be able to get two eyes by playing there, either, so black's not about to take it (since it doesn't affect white at all).

In fact, all it really ends up doing now is forcing black to connect, and removes the aji of moves like L18 and M19.]
;B[kc]
(;W[jg];B[gg];W[ng]C[yip:
White should play on a larger scale here; the stones at P16 are essentially captured anyway, so playing around N12 or N11 would be more effective.

I'd be more inclined to help the weak white group, though.  Otherwise, black will likely be able to build up the left side while chasing it around.]
;B[ki];W[kb];B[lb];W[ja];B[jh];W[hb];B[gb];W[ha]C[yip:
This is a terrible result for white!  The top left is completely open now, black's groups are all basically connected, as well as controlling the center of the board, and black has a huge moyo in the lower left now that will be very hard for white to invade.

White can't afford to be sealed in with K12; it's vital to at least get out into the middle.  Black would still be somewhat vulnerable, so white should be able to live.]
;B[be]C[yip:
Just playing C13 here would be good; it'd pretty much seal the left side, as well as seriously weakening the corner.]
;W[bd];B[ch];W[lh];B[kh];W[eb];B[jp]C[I feel like I'm already way behind here.  What happened?

yip:
White became too weak going after the black groups.  There were too many holes left in white's positions, when they should have been more solid to launch effective attacks.

Being sealed in on the top was huge, and pretty well decided the game.]

(;W[qn]LB[eh:C][cp:B][eq:A]C[yip:
This is small.  White needs to invade now to have any chance.

(C doesn't work yet, but is something to aim at in an invasion...)]
;B[nq];W[on];B[jm]LB[oj:A]C[yip:
Black is expanding much more rapidly.  In addition, invading at someplace like A would be relatively easy, because of all of black's influence.  That in turn makes P6 less valuable, since it wouldn't be helping make territory.]
;W[lo]C[Maybe N5 would have been safer?

yip:
White needs to invade deeply at this point - not reduce.  M5 goes a little too deep to be a reduction, but not enough to be an effective invasion.  It also allows black to gain even more thickness around white's open right side.  O5 would probably be better than either M5 or N5; it has a severe followup at N3, and doesn't leave any weaknesses behind.

By going into the lower left, white might still be able to live, and any thickness black gains there won't be as useful.]
;B[lq];W[ni]C[yip:
N10 or N9 would be better; the M12 stone isn't needed anymore.]
;B[nn];W[no]C[Wasn't sure how to handle his jumpcut.  What I did turned out badly, though.]
;B[oo]
(;W[mn];B[nm]C[yip:
White is chasing black into his own territory.  The white stones on the left end up very weak, since they face a black wall, so it would have been better to either played more lightly, or just come around at O6 instead of N6 (though that wouldn't been enough to win in this case...).]

yip:
As a closing thought, keep in mind that it's unreasonable to expect a moyo to all become your territory.  If the opponent invades, keep in mind that by attacking and building thickness, you'll naturally build solid territory, as well as making it easier for you to invade in turn.

A good example of this was the upper right corner - if white forced black to simply live small, there would still be a significant amount of territory on the right side, plus white could retaliate in the upper left.  In addition to all that, blacks position at the bottom would be thin, and white could easily invade there as well.  That indicates black made some overplays and had too many weak groups to take care of.

When attacking, make sure you don't help the opponent out.  Leaving weaknesses or cutting points in your own position will not only let the opponent live more easily, but force you to make the defensive moves that should have been played in the first place in gote later on.  Sometimes the most effective attack is to quietly build strength, threatening to follow up with a severe move.  While it may not kill, the opponent will generally have to live small or flee on dame.]
