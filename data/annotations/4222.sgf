C[[NL\] - Hello Reviewer,

I'm NhuLai 12K on KGS.

Thank you for looking at my game.

I would like you to help me on any number of things you see in the game that jump out at you.

Also, I would like you to let me know of the top 3 mistakes of my play in this game.

I will mark my comments as [NL\] -

[zs\] Hello, I'm ziggystar, 6k on KGS. I'll try my best at reviewing your game.

It's hard to point out the biggest mistakes. After all most mistakes have been compensated by mistakes by Black.

E.G. the move at P11 wasn't good. But it turned out ok because Black didn't manage to handle it properly.
But you've lost the Q15 group which was unnescessary.

You gave Black the opportunity to live easily on the left. But Black didn't use this opportunity and died there.

And finally the given variation at move 174 would have been much better than White's play in game.]
;B[pc];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[qi]C[[NL\] - chinese opening.  This opening is used so much in the games I play.  Is there any quick knowledge about it that you can give me?

Its strength is it goes fast and its flexibility.

Its weakness is..?  if any.

[zs\] Sorry, I have no idea.Usually I don't care much about the opening.]

(;W[nq]C[[NL\] - this seems bad for me after I look at it now.  Maybe the variation is better.

[zs\] I'd prefer this move over the variations. Approaching at the top right as proposed allows Black to make a nice corner enclosure.]
;B[np]C[[zs\] B's answer seems ok regarding blacks other stones.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[oq];B[pq];W[iq]LB[jq:A][qj:B]C[[NL\] -  Is there another joseki/way of playing that would not allow B to have such inflence?

[zs\] 
The outcome seems ok regarding that black had the first stone in this corner.


Usually White fixes at A. and Black at B.];B[jc];W[dj];B[fc]
;W[df]LB[cf:A]C[[zs\] I'd prefer White answering at A. This seems a bit more secure, having not all stones on the fourth line.]
;B[db]LB[jj:A]C[[zs\] This looks rather small. Maybe White should tenuki and play a bigger point. I'd be tempted to play Tengen at A which can assist when invading Black's positions.]
;W[oi]LB[qe:D][qf:B][ql:A][qo:C]C[[NL\] - Just instinct here, there may have been a better place?

[zs\] This move seems to play into Black's hands since B can now fix its position at A or B and get nice profit while White only get's a floating group which is not good.

Maybe better invade at C or D.];B[pk]C[[zs\] Now White's move looks misplaced.]
;W[qh];B[pi];W[ph];B[og]C[[zs\] Cutting here seems better since Black is strong in this area.]
;W[oh];B[qf]C[[zs\] Still a very nice result for Black. Because White didn't invade properly its position lacks a base.]
;W[ri]LB[oo:2][op:1][po:3]C[[NL\] - Maybe this move was slow.

[zs\] Yes. Since White can easily escape White should try to play something bigger like invading the corner with W1, B2, W3.]
;B[qk];W[rf]C[[NL\] - Seems like another slow move to me.];B[re]
;W[rg]
(;B[rj]C[[zs\] Black should have protected the cut.];W[qe];B[qd]
;W[pe];B[rd]
(;W[pf]C[[NL\] - Not best move

[zs\] See Variation O16.];B[pg];W[ng];B[of];W[nf];B[oe]C[[zs\] Very bad result for White.]
;W[li];B[pd]C[[zs\] Unnescessary capture by Black.];W[kd]LB[hc:A]
[lc:B]C[[NL\] - My thinking on this move is, try to separate the B living group and the B group that is not alive yet.

[zs\] This way Black can easily settle it's left group with something like A. Better play directly at A or B if you want to play here.]

(;B[cq]C[[zs\] I think Entering the corner at 3-3 isn't a good choice for Black since White will gain further outside influence in an area where White has some kind of open moyo. This will result in White gaining points while Black only gets a small corner.

Better try to invade and escape destroying white's moyo.];W[cp]
;B[dq]
(;W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[fr];W[gq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn]C[[zs\] White can be happy.]
;B[gr]
(;W[hr]C[[NL\] - Did I need to respond?  Seems so small.  I should of tenuki.

[zs\] Yes. letting Black crawl along the second line is usually good for White.Your proposed moves all seem reasonable.]
;B[mo];W[lp];B[cc];W[cd];B[dh]C[[zs\] This looks like an overplay by Black]
;W[ec];B[eb];W[fd];B[fh]
(;W[fj];B[ci];W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[bh];W[bf];B[ck]
(;W[cl]C[[zs\] This looks like the wrong direction. Please see variation.]
;B[ek]
(;W[ei]C[[NL\] - This move was so ugly.  I thought long and hard for a move here, but in the end the more I was thinking, the worst the situation got.  Should I have just captured?

[zs\] Simply connecting with E10 seems good for White. See variation.]
;B[dk];W[aj];B[bi];W[bl];B[ej];W[fi];B[di]C[[zs\] White didn't have to let this happen. Now Black is nearly safe here.]
;W[eh]
(;B[gg]C[[NL\] - A mistake big mistake by B?  I do not see any purpose behind this move.

[zs\] Yes. This move seems questionable.];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef]
;B[fg];W[fk];B[fl];W[gl];B[gk];W[el];B[fm];W[hk]C[[NL\] - Maybe there is something better here.

[zs\] This looks ok to me.];B[gj];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi];B[ij];W[ii]
;B[hl];W[jj];B[ik];W[gc];B[fb];W[hd];B[ig]C[[zs\] Black shouldn't be able to rescue these stones.

Looking now, Black didn't manage to make a good profit out of the invasion. But both players played questionable moves and the situation was changing from good for White to good for Black back to good for White.]
;W[jh];B[ge];W[gd];B[ie];W[jd];B[id];W[ic];B[lf]
(;W[me]C[[NL\] - This move seems not to be the best move.

[zs\] This move looks ok to me.];B[le];W[ld];B[md];W[mh]C[[NL\] - Are my worries too much here? Is N12 needed protection?

[zs\] This is not needed.];B[ib];W[hc];B[mc]C[[NL\] - wow, I think those stones (L16) is dead now, So I try to make the best of it.

[zs\] They can be saved. See variations.]

;W[hb];B[em];W[dl];B[cg]C[[zs\] This group is dead. Better leave it as Ko threads. So this Black move is not good.]
;W[bg]C[[zs\] White has to answer.];B[cf];W[ce];B[ch];W[bc]
;B[bb];W[dc];B[cb];W[bd]C[[NL\] - was there a better way of attacking C18 group?

[zs\] I can see none. The group should live.];B[ab];W[fa]C[[zs\] Black should tenuki. See variation.]

C[[NL\] - Thank you for looking at my game!

[zs\] You're welcome.

After all I think it was an even game where both parties had the opportunities to win easily but then unnescessarily lost groups or failed to capture opponent groups.

I noticed that white is a bit reluctant when invading. Try to invade a bit deeper with the opportunity to form a base.]
