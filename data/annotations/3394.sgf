C[ejb: Hi,
This game is typical of the kind of game I often play - I played white, and built what I thought was a nice framework, only for my opponent to reduce it enough to win by a small margin. Looking through the game, I realise I made a few tactical and reading errors, but I'd be interested to know where I made strategic mistakes in the opening and middle game.

Thanks!
Edwin.

prana: Dear Edwin,
this is my first analysis for the GTL and I really enjoyed it.
Thanks for your interesting game, there are very interesting aspects in it.

Your game, but also your questions and comments show, that you concern very much about strategical issues. 
I appreciate that attitude, because it is a prerequisite for getting stronger.
However, I think that the outcome of this game was more determined by tactical manoevers. And as this is quite common, it is well worth improving one's fighting technique as well. 

I added some variations to the game, which came into my mind. Just take them as alternative ideas and think about it. And please keep in mind that my ideas and proposals might be faulty also.

Best regards,
Christian (prana).];B[qd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[qj];B[qm]
;W[eq]C[ejb: I wondered if R7 needed responding to here. Is it urgent, or can I leave R10 to fend for itself? I think now I prefer to respond at R13.

prana: right. Without hesitation, play on R13. 
Two reasons:
1. it makes a base for R10
2. it limits the influence of the black shimari.];B[ce];W[ee]
C[ejb: looking at this move now, it doesn't seem to do much. Maybe a pincer at c13 works better with the enclosure below?

prana: right. 
A pincer around C11 is the right direction.

However, R13 seems still the biggest move to me.];B[bc];W[dj]
;B[dg];W[eg]C[prana: questionable. You are pushing B into your position on the lower left. The value of the w wall is limited by the strength of the b shimari.

instead I would make an extension on the top. E.g. K17];B[dh]
;W[cf]C[prana: looks like tesuji, but does it really work?]

(;B[bf]C[prana: too submissive. b should fight.];W[df];B[bh]
;W[jd]C[ejb: It feels like white is building quite a nice framework here, but possibly K4 is better? I didn't want black to play at K16,

prana: k16 is absolutely neessary. A black stone here would totally destroy the influence of the white upper group and  perfectly fit with the black corner.]
;B[eh];W[fg];B[qh];W[ph];B[pg]
(;W[qg]C[prana: questionable.
b is very strong in this region. 
I would not cut. Any fight here seems to help b.];B[qf];W[qi]
;B[rg];W[ql]C[prana: the w group is heavy. 
b made easy profit.];B[lq]C[prana: ??
b should answer the w move. eg. on q7];W[qq]C[prana: risky. You have a weak and heavy group in the neighborhood...]

(;B[qo];W[ol]C[prana: you where very lucky to get this move...
do you see how important this w move is?
That is why you should first play here, and later you can invade.
First secure your groups, than attack.
Very important.];B[oh];W[pm]C[ejb: Is this necessary, or is it better to escape lightly? I wanted to stop black making good use of the wall in the bottom right.

prana: this is good:
1. it strengthens your group
2. there is a strong continuation on w p5];B[pn];W[on];B[oo]

(;W[fj]C[prana: difficult point in the game.

What is your intention in playing w F10?
Building a w framework in the middle?

I don't consider that a good plan. 
1. b is thick on the right side. Therefore, you can't expect much territory in the middle.
2. w is wide open on the left side. B b12 is just waiting for jumping in.

See the variants for some alternative strategies.]
(;B[hr]C[prana: Playing voluntarily on the 2. line can't be a good idea.
I think, b should invade on the left immediately.]
(;W[gq]C[prana: better defend the left side.];B[ip];W[be]C[prana: this is a clever move! Very good.]

(;B[ae]
(;W[cg]C[prana: give the atari. Keep maximum pressure on b.]

I assume, you wanted to expand your mojo. Then, just do it.]

(;B[bk]C[ejb: I overlooked this. Suddenly that framework doesn't look so good...

prana: yes. the left side is no territory at all.
But b should have played c9.]
(;W[bj]C[prana: does this work? Maybe.
I would have defended.];B[cj];W[ck]
(;B[aj]C[prana: no. That is too easy for w.];W[bl];B[bi];W[cl]
C[prana: w was very lucky here.];B[ed]C[prana: doesn't work.]
;W[dd];B[cd];W[cc]C[ejb: Maybe I should leave this for later and player f16 straight away.

prana: There is no aji to leave. Taking the points in sente is allright.]
;B[bd];W[fd]C[prana: well done.];B[kf]C[ejb: I wasn't sure which direction to respond to this from. Looking back, maybe something like m17 is better, taking territory at the top.

prana: yes. M17 is correct.]
(;W[kh];B[kd]
(;W[jc]C[prana: play the hane. Its big.];B[kc]
(;W[mg]C[prana: too small. Wrong direction.
you could build a huge mojo now with w L6.]
(;B[me]C[prana: b should invade the mojo.];W[jf];B[pi];W[ok]
C[prana: rather pointless. o6 is correct.];B[nn];W[le]C[prana:this fight here is contra-productive.
You are weakening your wall k17.
b is very thick here. Never start a fight, where your opponent is thick.]
;B[ke];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[ng];W[lf];B[md];W[lg]
(;B[nd]C[prana: unnecessary. b is very thick. No need to defend.
b should fight back.];W[jg]C[ejb: I did this to protect against black breaking into the top left territory, but maybe somewhere else is bigger. l6 maybe?

prana: no, no. This move (k13) is huge!
It keeps your stones together. Very essential.];B[lk];W[mj]
;B[mk];W[nj];B[il]C[ejb: I'm never sure how to defend against this sort of thing. Just defend the territory? j8 feels difficult to attack.

prana: the last moves were very strong from both sides!

j8 is indeed difficult to attack.];W[mm]C[prana: tesuji or overplay? 
don't give away stones for nothing!];B[nm]
(;W[gl]C[prana: defending is solid.

However, ...

... you could also try an attack. 
But I admit, I don't know if the attack works or not.
So you have to choose between a solid variation and a risky one.]

;W[kp];B[lo];W[jr];B[kq];W[ir]C[prana: if b plays p10, the game is over.]
