C[This was a game that upsetted me. Not because I lost, but because how I lost. I think what happened in this game happens to me a lot, and I want to learn how to overcome this major flaw in my game.

The main point with this game was: I played white, and I helped black build two strong walls facing each other, I helped him close those walls, and I ended the ordeal by miserabilly failling at invading his enormous territory.

Thanks for any time you take reviewing this one.];B[pd];W[dp]

(;W[cd]TR[ec][ed][pd]C[This is usually not thought of as a good move, because it invites black to approach it from the side where he is already strong in the corner.

Compare to the variation.];B[ed]
(;W[dc]C[This is passive and gives away too much to be considered joseki in most circumstances.  See other options.]
;B[ec];W[db];B[eb];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[eg]TR[nc][qo]C[This ended part one of my failure.

I don't think this position by itself looses the game. Black built a tall wall, with great influence, but I believe my profit was high.

Locally, this is a good assesment.  White has made 4th line territory and can still hane at E12.

White has two other moves he would like to make now, as marked.]
(;W[qo]C[I think this is the right move of the two, but white needs to try to get sente in the result.]

;B[qq];W[nk];B[ml]C[So far, this has gone quite well for white.]
;W[hq]C[This is perhaps a bit loose.  I think white should either play a bit closer to the corner or support the bottom right group a little more.]
;B[cn];W[cl]C[This seems good.];B[en];W[el]C[This is dangerous, as white's corner is quite thin.]

Consider the variation.];B[fn];W[eh];B[fh];W[di];B[ep];W[do]

I think white can save the stones by extending from the other side.]

;W[bp]C[Because black can capture, this is just helping black strengthen himself.]
;B[co];W[hp];B[lo]
(;W[kp];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe]C[I believe I lost the game in a fair number of moments. Letting black build this second wall was very bad for me. I think I should've prevented it may moves back. I could've played O17 in move b14, but even if I failed to do that, I believe I should've rushed to P14.

After this moment, my game got worst and worst, as I tried desperatelly to reduce and then invade his large region.

My comments end after this move, since I'm aware of how bad many of these moves are.

I find myself in this situation very often, in which I feel I help my opponent to build and secure a huge moyo. There is something very wrong with my direction of play.

Thanks for the help.

(;W[qh]TR[ph]C[While this move will be necessary later, if white gets cut now, it's not the end of the world.  White should be able to kill the cutting stones.

In addition, connecting at the marked point instead leaves less aji for black later.]
;B[nh]C[This sequence was fine locally, but perhaps white should have invaded or reduced earlier.  As black's wall gets larger, white has less scope for action inside.]
;W[mk];B[ll];W[lk];B[kk];W[li];B[lh]
(;W[ki]C[I think white can hane instead and fight.  I've posted a couple hypothetical sequences, but I'm not sure if they would work against a determined opponent.]

;B[ko];W[op];B[oq]C[Honestly, at this point, white is not doing too badly.  Black has one big territory up top, which white could reduce at S17, and the bottom left corner.  White has two decent sides, plus a chunk of the bottom.  Black may be ahead by a bit, but not overwhelmingly.

A strict count gives maybe 33 points white top left, 17 on the bottom, and 38 on the right.

Black has 9 on the bottom right, plus anything he can get in the corner there (could be a couple, could be more), 21 + 4 prisoners = 25 in the bottom left, and 50ish on top.

This gives us about Black 100 vs White 88.  Not the best, but quite recoverable at this stage.  Some big moves were pointed out earlier, specifically S17 and B7 in sente, S3 and P2 in gote, and also E17, which is only a 4 point swing, but is sente for whomever plays it.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[gg];B[gh];W[gf];B[hh];W[fe]C[These stones have little in way of eyeshape, so it is likely just giving a gift to black.]

C[Black is alive on both sides, so cutting is not a threat, and does not remove any points in this case.  Black can safely ignore this.]

;B[pi];W[qi];B[rc]C[This move has been very large for a while, and both sides should have played it earlier.]
;W[pj];B[ni];W[ea];B[fa];W[fb]C[This does not work.  White can play D19 instead and black is forced to respond, leaving white to go to B7.]

[rs][ss]C[Overall, the biggest mistake in this game for white seems to have been in the lower left corner.

After that, the game was still winnable at this level with a good endgame, but I think white gave up too early and tried desperate maneuvers that made the situation worse, as with the dead group around H15.]
