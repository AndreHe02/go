C[white: Thomas Pototschnig 4k

I'm white

Reviewer = "carl"];B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[qi]C[I often read that after R16 P17 are in place R11 is urgent in order to prevent a large framework from B.

But I think the continuation bR9 wR14 bR6 seems to good for black.

Is there an alternative how to play better?];B[qk];W[qf]LB[ok:B]
C[carl: see variation.  Black's move at A is too flat.  B creates an ideal formation along the lower right side and attacks white's two stones more strongly.  (Black is trying to make territory directly rather than building a framework.)]
;B[qn];W[jq]C[carl: good];B[fc];W[hc];B[fe];W[df];B[cc]LB[dc:B]
[cd:A]C[carl: Why not separate the black groups?  (A) gives white only a tiny extension and black gets easy life.  See variation B, in which both players are about even.]

(;W[cd];B[dc]LB[kc:B][ed:A]C[carl: here white should just play B and make life on top]

(;W[ed];B[ec]C[carl: black mistake.  just play F16 or G17 to stay connected.]
;W[fd];B[gd];W[gc]C[I thought cutting would be a good idea but black already got too large in the corner. I think I messed the joseki up.

What would have been better instead of cutting?

carl: see previous.  just make life at L17.];B[ge];W[ie]LB[kc:B]
[bd:A]C[this seems to be a mistake isn't it?
Because I get in trouble after bH16 ...

The 2nd thing I don't know is what would have happened if black had played on L17 ... I assume E15 is strong enough to escape because the left side is almost empty and C16 is quite weak ...

carl: yes, L17 is big.  see variation B]

;B[ef]LB[cf:A][ei:B]C[carl: you actually didn't need to respond to this move.  it's hard to see, but variation B ends up being much better.]

(;W[cf];B[cn];W[cl];B[en];W[fp];B[cq];W[cp];B[bp];W[dq]TR[ef]
[dg][dh][fh][cn][en]C[carl: this is too passive for my taste.  separate black's groups with B5 instead and you have a nice splitting attack agains the marked groups]
;B[br];W[cr];B[bq]LB[ei:B][jo:A]C[carl: point B is sente.  black will be in trouble after that.]

(;W[jo]TR[ei][oi][nq]C[carl: this only does one thing, make territory (and not that much territory).  I prefer any of the marked positions.  P11 secures your right side group and would help in attacking the black G15 group, AND could help reduce black's territory on the right.]
;B[of];W[oi]C[P11 seems to be a mistake ... because (see move 55)

carl: I think P11 is fine.];B[ph];W[qh];B[pi]LB[pj:A][qj:B]

(;W[pj];B[qj]C[because P14 is like a ladder breaker ...

what would have been a better answer for bP14?];W[pg];B[oh]
;W[og];B[nh]LB[oe:A][ng:B]C[carl: just push through at B]
(;W[oe];B[oj]C[carl: black plays small gote move];W[nf]C[carl: so does white]
;B[mc];W[mq];B[le];W[pc];B[pd];W[od];B[ob];W[qc]C[I played R17 because of bS17 wQ15 in sente but this wasn't good as well]
;B[rc];W[pe];B[re]LB[ld:A][ig:B]C[carl: attack the G15 group.  M16 doesn't do much.]

(;W[ld];B[md];W[me];B[mf];W[ne];B[lf];W[mg]C[carl: what was the goal of this move?  capturing the three stones at M15?  if so, play J13 first.]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[jc]C[carl: k17 overplay];W[jd];B[lc];W[kd];B[lh]
;W[ni];B[ig]C[should I have taken the black stones?
I was worried about the weak white group on the top ...
On the other side of view black got some pressure on my not yet living group and as a result of this he built a large framework beneath O11 ...]
;W[hg];B[pk]LB[ih:B][li:A]C[carl: see variation B.  I think it's a better result for white.]

was this okay?

carl: As far as I can tell black is alive in the top left corner so he can play A10.  I can't read it out though, so I'm not surprised black answered at F18.]
;B[fb];W[ri]C[carl: now THIS move was small compared to E11.]
;B[ei];W[dj];B[ej];W[ak];B[am];W[bj];B[gl]C[I should have seen E11 ...

carl: E11 was big for most of the game.

carl: No more comments past here.  Endgame looks mostly okay]
