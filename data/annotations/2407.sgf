C[Hi,

thanks in advance for reviewing this game. I added some comments and questions during the opening and also in the  middlegame.

Florreke.];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq]
(;W[qo]C[This is a risky move, but a good one.  Leting black have the last corner has to be equaled by what is gained with R5.  Alternatively you could see how black responds to R5 and then take the corner your self and leave R5 in blacks area as potential for later (aji).  Both take a fair amount of understanding of how to work the move.  Perhaps research the josekis around the chinese fuseki so your not scared of it.  Or maybe just play lightly and make a sanrensei (see variation)


This move intends to avoid black to play R9 ( chinese fuseki ) I think this move is OK, but I always have some problems with the follow up of this move ...]
;B[np]C[This is a standard joseki.  Emphasizes the lower side which right now is empty so this is the right direction for black.  A follow up in the corner will give him a nice lead.  White should likely take the corner and force black to attack his R5 stone.


an alternative for black is:  the pincer at Q8. But I guess O4 is alright  ...]
;W[pl]C[I feel this is too risky for you.  R8 gives more of a base for your group.  This is more open to attack and since black has a strong corner so close makes Q8 all the worse.]
;B[dp]C[white I feel is behind and is lacking a suitable followup move to even things up.  the weakness in the white side group should be tended too though.  R13 perhaps.]

(;W[jp]C[Black has made living shape in the corner but white has not yet on the upper side.  A move at R11say could be costly to white.  White now has created another white group to defend in black territory.  White is very busy.


white K4:  I decide to play here, to avoid black making shape with its O4 stones.
Maybe it had been better to play lower at K3, but it seems ok to me...]
;B[lq];W[fq]C[This move is baiting black to cut in between.  The stones can't be seperated but black can make some gaines here.  So key to playing this is making sure you that you want black to cut in between so you can use his moves to create something, like out side influence.  If you don't want him to cut then G4 or 3 make good moves to reduce the size of his corner.  


white F3: I still think white F3 is ok.  Black decides to fight.... Could F4 be an alternative ? Or G4 ?]
;B[hq];W[hp]C[Here are some ways for black to play out and do far better then he managed in actual play.]

(;B[gp];W[gq];B[ip];W[ho]C[Some better ways for black.]
(;B[fp];W[iq];B[hr];W[ir];B[eq];W[gr];B[cf];W[eo];B[ep];W[ch]
C[white C12:  I thought the C12 stone could work well with the white stones at H5.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[ec]C[No this is better for black.  White E16 is a good move but it allows black this move which makes black's corner bigger and so worth more points.  White E17 is possible and is a very common joseki.  Black must make life and he has, so anything more is bonus.

Now black plays E17, instead of the usual B16 and then black F17. The result is somewhat at a disadvantage for black I think.]
;W[fc]C[So: hane];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb]
(;W[fe]C[H17 is the only move here.  If white doesn't then black must.  See variations.


white F15: very safe now for white, but maybe a bit slow. Better white E13
instead ? or C9 ? Any suggestions are welcome  :)]
(;B[dh]C[Black misses the vital point of H17.  Focuses on saving stones that should be left untill they can be more fully exploited as aji later.]
;W[io]C[Waste of a move.  The ladder is in whites favour and black hasn't played a ladder breaking move.  And even if he did H4 and H5 are still connnected to other white stones through the capture at H1.  This is a wholely unnessecary move.  Why not C11?  or C13 maybe.  D12 is aggresive, perhaps too much so.  You must respond to maintain your advantage.]
;B[do]C[Black should use whites blunder to reinforce his attack around the D14 stone.  E5 is a weak stone already and further weakening it with D5 is slow.  D6 might better serve black's interests.  Or as I said above reinforce his attack around D14 directly.]
;W[bc]C[This is sente so black must respond.  It works well to further weaken C14.

white B17: D11 had been better...];B[bb]C[This however is not sente.  Black is pretty much alive so allowing him to capture B17 won't affect the life and death struggle of that corner.  In fact if black does decide to capture white with B16 he only gets something like 5 points total.  Right now there are many many bigger moves available so B16 would be waste of a move for black.]

(;W[bd];B[ci]C[this moves improves blacks position greatly on the left side so now H17 becomes more important.  If black moves at H17 then wites group there will be under a great deal of pressure since it is without eyes and has no real area to expand into easily.  You must tend to this group directly or indirectly right now.  starting in another area will allow black to grab the advantage on your now weakened group.   

Remeber moves like H17.  I can not stress how much better your position is with it.]
;W[qf]C[More important things right now.  Your left side group is weak and heavy.  H17.  

In this case R14 is too aggressive.  When blacks pincer attack comes it is attacking both Q8 and R14.  If Q8 was a better settled group (Q8 was R8 for example) then this might be a good move.  This here is asking for trouble.  White is making himself busy again.


white R14: Not sure about this move. It leaves an invasion possibility, while the
Q8 stones are not settled yet. Maybe better R11 then, with the possibility
to R14 later ...];B[qh]C[There it is.];W[of];B[nc];W[rd];B[qc]
;W[rq]C[S3 is good.  If black doesn't respond white gets R2 which should be enough to make life plus make a move on black's group there.  Black must becareful with this move as his group's eye space could be greatly reduced which can easily lead to death.

white S3: this had to be R10... .];B[rk]C[he is confident in his corner group.  I feel you should make your group a base while pressuring black at the same time.  S8 i think works well.]

(;W[mf]C[This misses the point.  Your right side group isn't really settled yet so its still pretty weak.  Black is getting settled at your expense.  Very costly.  Play N14 when its nessecary.  Right here worry about making life for your side and threatening life on black's corner and upper side group.  S8 works.


white N14: Slow ?  Maybe better Q10.];B[rn]C[White is completely baseless now and has to make a correction to keep from being cut.  Black is now pretty well settled.  S6 is a lovely move for black and should not have been allowed to happen.]
;W[qn];B[rm];W[qi];B[ri];W[ph];B[qj];W[pi];B[rg];W[qg];B[rh]

(;W[rc]C[Of course Q10!  neither group has eye space and is they get seperated they could be easily threatened.  Plus it carves out a nice chunk of the center by making use of N14 which might otherwise have been a waste.

S7 does little.  If black needs that group can expand along the side to make life.  Or if that is blocked S18 is still available.  Q10 is far more pressing for white.


white S17:  better Q10, to avoid that black separates the two white groups ...]
;B[pj];W[qr];B[pr]
(;W[di]C[A proverb says one shoudl extend from a cross cut.  See variations for what happens when black plays a very simple move.  Its dramatically beter for black.  White got lucky here.  Something needed to be done before C11 was ever played.  


D12: finally I decided to do something with that white C12 stone.  I got two separated
groups as a result, which I thought was not so bad because of the left side
still more or less open.]
(;B[bh];W[cj];B[bi];W[eh];B[dg];W[eg];B[dj];W[dk];B[ei];W[ck]
C[Black still has some chances to make some nice territory and invade whites center.  See variations]

(;B[ek]C[I agree for once :)

Black E9: had to be C7, I think.];W[cm];B[ef];W[ff];B[gh];W[el]
;B[dm];W[dl];B[en];W[bo];B[bp];W[cn];B[dn];W[fk];B[ej];W[fl]
;B[fg];W[bj]C[H17 is devastating here.]
(;B[ig]C[The results here are pretty even except for the attack on G17 group.  At this point white has three groups that must make life and none have an easy way to do that.  H17 remains the best place for both sides to move.  

Black J13: Looks like a good move in this situation. It is a jump into the center
, plus it threatens the white g17 group ...];W[id]C[H17 is stronger simpler.  This performs the same function though.  Plus now your doing it to ensure you live and can't get much territory out of the area.  Black will end up with much of that side.  


white J16: Not sure
now about this move, but I didn't see an alternative. I had to go out with
the white g17 stones, but black is all around.  H17 instead ??]
;B[kc]C[Black L17: good move from black.];W[lc];B[ld];W[jc]
;B[kb];W[jb];B[jd];W[je];B[kd];W[ie]

;B[ng];W[ni];B[li];W[kg];B[lg];W[ji];B[lk];W[bq]C[This doesn't work for white.  See variations.


white B3: What about this move ? I saw it in many games, and i think it could be
used here. I calculated it over and over again, what would happen if black
answered with A4 instead of C4.

What about B A4, W C4, B C5, W C3, B B6, W D2, B E2, W A3, and black captures at A5. White is dead in the corner.


Here does my comments end.

Black wins with some 8 points difference ( no komi ).

I think that in the opening things can be improved, certainly for white ( also for black ).

thanks.]

The evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of groups needs some help (who doesn't need that help though)  Study some common joseki (openings) and life and death problems.  The life and death will make it more clear what is weak and what is strong.  Hope this helps.
