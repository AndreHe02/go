The first move is traditionally played in the upper right
corner.];W[dd];B[dq];W[pd];B[pj]C[B q10 looks unusual. B c5 is a standard
fuseki (opening).];W[do];B[cf]C[B c14 gives W a good move around d10
(pincer against c14 and extension of d5), so I would probably play in the
lower left here.];W[fc]C[W plays passively here; I would play at d10
instead.];B[bd];W[cc];B[ci];W[cq];B[dp]C[The standard joseki is B
c2.];W[cp];B[eo];W[dn]C[B now has a cutting point at
e4.];B[en];W[cl];B[jq];W[nq];B[oq]C[Correct attack by
B.];W[np];B[pn];W[kp];B[kq];W[lq];B[lp]C[The exchange B m4 W m5 does not help
B. B should directly play at k4.];W[lo];B[jp];W[ko];B[jo]C[B could force at
m2 first. The B wall k3-k5 now indirectly protects against the cut at e4, but
k5 would probably be better placed at j6.];W[lr]C[W m2 is solid but too slow
at this point. B is now ahead.];B[cr]C[c2 is big, but r14 is probably bigger,
because the B territory is open at the bottom anyway (at j1).];W[is]C[W j1 is much too early; it is an endgame move. W should play b2 then
somewhere on the right side (r3 or r12).];B[ir]C[B r14 is bigger than j2.]
;W[js]C[W k1 is
still too early. W can easily give up j1 at this point.];B[hr]C[The simplest
move here is a sacrifice at B L1, to allow B h1 later.];W[br];B[dr];W[em]
C[W
gives up sente here; W should play on the right side
instead.];B[fm];W[el];B[nr]C[B o2 is big because it protects against W r3,
but B r14 is probably bigger.];W[ql];B[qm]C[B r6 is probably stronger because
it doesn't leave a weakness at r5.];W[pl];B[qf];W[nd]C[W o16 might be better
at r12 to help the r8 stones.];B[lc]C[B should attack the R8 stones instead.
B m17 is the origin of most of B's problems
later.];W[ld];B[kc];W[mc];B[hc];W[qh]C[W was under pressure on the right side
but is now taking the initiative. This is the consequence of B
m17.];B[rd];W[qc];B[rc];W[rb];B[rh];W[ri];B[qg];W[ph]C[W has reinforced his
position on the right side and B is under attack.];B[of];W[nh];B[oi]C[Not all
peeps are good. B should first consider what can happen if W ignores it.
Here b should probably defend at T13, which threatens the cut at
r11.];W[oh]C[W could instead capture at s13 in sente. This would ensure the
connection with the r8 group, and maintain a strong pressure on the top right
B group.];B[rl]C[B does not have time to play s8, because W n14 threatens the
life of the top right B group. (See variation).]
(;W[rk]C[W should first play
n14 in sente (as in the previous variation).];B[rm]C[Again, B does not have
time to connect because W can kill the top right group (see
variation).]

q2 was the vital point here (see variation).];W[pr];B[or];W[rr]C[it's too
late to kill W now (see variation)]

bad because it is gote.  W is alive already.];W[pq];B[op];W[ro];B[so]C[

(;W[jm]C[W should have first applied
some pressure on the weak B groups to build a magnificent center. (See
variation).];B[kd];W[gm]C[W could have played solidly at m15 since this would
have been almost sente against the top right B group. Also W b17 is much
bigger than W g7.];B[gn];W[fl];B[fn];W[le];B[oc];W[od];B[mb]C[B is too
greedy. B should first ensure the life of the top right B group.]
(;W[nc]C[W
should kill the B group instead (see variation).];B[nb]C[B should ensure the
life of the right group instead. Without this weak group, B could play at p18
instead of o18.];W[ob]C[W misses another opportunity to kill B.];B[jf]C
[...
and B gives yet another opportunity to
W.];W[re]C[Finally!];B[qe];W[rf];B[sf];W[sc];B[sd]C[B is dead in
gote.];W[nf]C[W is correct to play safe when leading. But W m13 would be just
as safe and win more points.];B[qd];W[pb];B[jj]C[B's only hope now is to
attack the top left W group, so B should play B17, which is very
big.];W[lj];B[kk];W[lk];B[kl]C[B b17 is bigger than L8.];W[km]C[W b17 bigger
than L7.];B[ll];W[mm];B[lh];W[ef]C[B can't do much in this area because of
the thickness at e8-f8. W b17 would still be bigger, but W could also simply
defend at n11.];B[dg]C[B plays safely, but one must play more agressively
when losing. For example B could follow up m12 with n11.];W[fi]C[W f11 is a
dame (neutral point). There is no territory to be made here. b17 and n11 are
much bigger. However f11 prepares an attack at W L11 so it still has some
value.];B[ee]C[B e15 only reinforces W.];W[de];B[fe];W[df];B[cg];W[gd]C

e15 just created another weak
group.];B[ec];W[ed];B[fb];W[gc];B[gb];W[eb];B[ge];W[hd];B[ic]C[ xiaochun 18k

force B to connect. W should play g12 instead, threatening
L11.];B[ff];W[hf];B[fg]C[B loses sente here. The W group at top left is not
in danger.];W[ki]C[Good. This is an ideal splitting attack against both k10
and m12.];B[ji];W[kh];B[jh];W[jg];B[kg];W[ig];B[mi];W[mk];B[li]C[The M11-L10

j8 instead of k8 is better because it would be sente. But W should play b17
sente first.];B[gl]C[If B wants to add a stone in this area, it would be
better at J7. But again B must defend the top left group.];W[in];B[io]C

live with d12 (see variation).];W[bh]C[B is dead now. d12 no longer works

The main lesson from this game is to avoid creating weak groups, and to
defend before it is too late. B lost two big groups for not having defended
correctly, and lost many points while trying to save other weak groups. B had
a reasonable game before B m17. B should improve several stones simply by
avoiding creating weak groups.])
