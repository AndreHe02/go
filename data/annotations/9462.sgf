Hi,

I'm playing black in this game.

I felt like this was an interesting game for me to get reviewed as I think I have played reasonably well during the opening (which is usually something I am very bad at, and am trying to improve through studying). This is why I would welcome a more experienced eye on the game to see what could be improved and what was eventually wrong.

I am curious to see whether the white's upper right corner could have been killed, should I have played differently..

Overall, I think my endgame was pretty bad as I should be able to kill white group on the right side but forgot to read one move that allowed white to live.

Thank you for the review. Hope you'll enjoy doing it ;)

playing this big point to try and prevent white from taking it and starting to build a big moyo.

yes, this is one possible strategy.
(LL)];W[cj]LB[cg:A][ch:B]

(LL)];W[ej];B[cm]C[[untitled\]
Not sure about this one. It felt good to steal white's base off, but on the other hand it felt kind of low as white was already out in the center.

this move is a good idea, as it prevents white to make a base.
(LL)];W[gc];B[ec]CR[dd][cg]TR[gc][cj][ej]C[very well : black takes the corner with an ideal shape, and putting pressure on the three whites stones.

Starting from here, and for a couple of moves, I felt like white had the initiative too much to make this group safe but I didn't know how to reply with some pressure, while not compromising too much territory either on the lower left side or in the upper left corner (maybe this is a bad thinking).

black has already won the game and do not need to kill white here, so I would play safe as you did in the game
(LL)];B[bg]C[this move is simple and good : securing a big corner and keeping pressure on white's group.
