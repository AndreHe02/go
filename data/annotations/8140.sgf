C[Hi and thanks for the review. This is a game I had against who I thought was another 15k, but who later claimed to be a 5k with another account, trying to help beginners. Unfortunately something happened that meant we could not do the review afterwards. Anyway, I would be interested to know where I went wrong and how I could have stopped him building up such a large single territory (as you will see). Thanks again!]
;B[pd]C[Hi, my name is Jim.  The last time I played on KGS has to be about a year ago, but at that time I was approaching 7k.  I haven't gotten much better since then due to not having much enthusiasm about playing go online anymore.  I live in Japan and play occassionally with the old men that go to the Go Salon in my town.  They are all much better than me, of course.  I remember when I was 15k.  A big step forward at this point is to learn to spot patterns and problems earlier than usual.  Also, playing globally and using influence.]
;W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[fq];W[dn];B[kq]C[I have been testing out the mini-Chinese recently. Not sure how well I am playing it though.]

;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd];B[fc]C[M17 is in a bit of danger, so it's a bit impulsive to suddenly jump to another area.  Finish settling M17 first.]
;W[ic];B[fe];W[de]C[There hasn't been any problems so far, but you should consider M17 dead at this point.]
(;B[fg]C[In opening, keep thinking about sente.  This move does nothing for you and doesn't threaten him.]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[pb];B[qe]C[Trying to gain strength.

It doesn't make sense to do it here.  R18 is a better choice, this move reenforces an already safe opening.]

;W[ar];B[aq];W[br];B[bs];W[ds];B[ao];W[es];B[nq]C[Should I tried to have make more of the bottom left? I figured it was pretty blocked in so I should secure.

It wouldn't have become anything more than this, no matter what you did.]

(;B[qm]C[Should I have run further with F11 instead?

Don't run in a straight line, play something like H14, and give yourself some easy eye shape.  Or better yet, start pressuring him, beacuse his left is developing!]
;W[gi];B[hg]TR[di][gi][bn][dn][ho]C[Now he is pushing you around to make a bigger moyo.]
;W[jg];B[dg]C[This was worrying now and the fight was very hard. Even though I gained life I was totally blocked in...]

Not much of a threat, he will just cut you.];B[kj];W[jn]C[By this point the game is looking bad for you, you HAVE to break in somehow.  The reason he is beating you is because he knows you will react to his moves the way he wants.

I don't really know what you can do at this point to turn the game around....]
(;B[ln];W[kl];B[lk]C[Do you see how instead he is just bullying you and building his area as a consequence?]

This game is a bit hard to critique because it's not that you made BAD moves.  The problem is you just let your opponent have his way with you.  Almost every move you made was a reaction to his.  Always think about how to make HIM react to YOU instead.]
