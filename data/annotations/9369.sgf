C[Hi,

I play about 4k at the moment, which I mention to express that I am no dan or pro and that everything I suggest is basically the opinion of a beginner, just like you (I might be wrong quite often).

White suffers from gote quite a few times and on a certain levels has an ambivalent style (makes influencial choices early, but later on plays in a territorial fashion).

White should read some chapters of "Attack and Defense" by Ishida Davies and something abuot life and death - particularly the famous J-group in the corner.

I will not comment on every move but try to stick to the most important aspects of the game from my point of view, as this was said to me by other beginners to be the most fruitful way to learn.

The review goes up to move 100.

C[This is an unusual move from black.

I guess B wants to lure you into a fighting from the very beginning, contrasting your pieceful opening, i.e. W did not try to pollute Bs sides by something like a komoku at D17 or so.]
;W[pn]C[This is an influental move - be conscious about this.]

(;W[qj];B[oo];W[qm]C[W did respond to B at every move (to deny him eyespace), but is now in the situation of fearing for his own eyespace.

I guess when influence is Ws goal, he should have contacted p5 in the usual manner (variation at move 15).

W is beeing pushed around here.];B[po];W[qo];B[qg]C[W is safe. B protects his hoshi.]
;W[cf];B[fd]
(;W[di]LB[ce:A]C[Influential move.

Strange. I remeber this as an alternative to another joseki (variation at move 23), when W wants to get some influence. When B kicks at A in this situation, W is overconcentrated. The usual move for W to let the corner open would be d10.]

(;B[cj]
(;W[ci]C[Territorial move. W is overconcentrated.

(;W[cm]SQ[em][dp][fp]C[Territorial move.

Good thinking. W wants to deny B eyespace. Unfortunately B builds up a wall himself in the process and spoils Ws sphere of influence around D4. E10, a hane at the head of two might be worth a thought, too.]
;B[ej];W[jq]LB[bd:A]SQ[ci][di][cj][dj]C[This is totally wrong in my eyes. The most imprtant area at the moment is the squared one. I would at least secure my own group with a move like A before I start any new battles.

Also k3 is much too close to the strong black group around p4 - its not like white has something comparable  on the other side. The pair of D4 and C7 looks very open in contrast to p4.]
;B[iq]C[Black sees this issue and trys to separate W immediately.]

(;W[jp]C[This move is heavy. A jump or a hane would be more flexible in my opinion.]
;B[ip];W[gq]C[Territorial move.

Good thinking again - but you plan was not ripe enough. W is isolated while black builds another wall and spoils the rest of whites down/left mojo / sphere of influence.

With moves like this, W gives black the chance to get ahead of his own weak group and thus will push from behind in the following battle. W has no time for this, thats why he can't attack in the fashion of G3 or C7.]
;B[io];W[mp]TR[op][nq]C[This is a typical shape for attack.

W is at a great disatvatange right now, so the shape does not suit him.]

C[W could have made life immediately with L2. W can not hope to surround J4 soon, because he himself is not secure enough in my eyes and further has no outside walls to contain B.]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[js];W[hr];B[ir]
(;W[jo]C[Too simple. To move out I would at least consider movs like L8 and to push black I would think about K6 (to jump ahead of B).]

(;W[jn]C[W is pushing from behind and has one eye at the moment.. See the variation.

LB[nl:C][on:A][qs:B]C[I don't think W can kill, because B P6 and R1 are miai. So this group at C makes no sense at this point of the game in my opinion.]
;B[jk];W[el]C[W is not in the positino to attack here. W just harms his group at C11, as he realises a few moves later.]
;B[gj];W[fi];B[fj];W[ei]LB[bd:A]C[Gote - and W gains no real security here (compared to A, which would be much better and probably sente).]
;B[om];W[ol];B[pm];W[pl];B[on];W[qn];B[cq]LB[on:A]C[We see here what difference sente makes in the middle game. Black settled himself around A in sente and can now go for further points. But I would not invade but secure the upper side as B.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bq];W[bp];B[er];W[fr];B[ds]C[W should recognise this shape as the J group and learn how to kill it:

;B[aq];W[es]LB[ce:A]C[I am unsure if W did this on purpose. Yes, it lets open the posssibility of a ko later - and that is a nice feature which I did not see. Blacks fear is the reason why this ended in sente for W.

But I as W, would not like to play this ko - even if it means a great loss for B locally. But I would be HAPPY about any sort of sente. As black I would not be interested in the invasion (which is likely to be gote wihtout ko in my opinion) but

SECURE THE BIG UPPER SIDE

or maybe kick at A first before I do so.];B[fs];W[gs];B[es]
;W[mc]C[W is NOT in the position to give black a big corner (up right) so easily.

I think the game is lost here. Black has too many points and after Q18 no real weaknesses.

Don't get angry if some of my comments seemed to direct. I like Ws style and would describe it as honest but shy and too ambivalent. Learn a few things (attack and defense, what is pushing from behind, something about the J-group and count points a little more often in the game to get a feeling about the balance of points and influence in the game) - but above all:

If you play high moves and you like to go for influence then you will have to utulize these high stones. You can not get anxious later and try to treat 4th line stones as they were on the 3rd line. Its like sying: Look black, I stand high above you! If come here, you will crumble, live small and I will get tremendous outside walls which will make the game impossible for you!

But then later, when black tries to sneak in behave like "nonono, don't rob of my base here, please!".

If you want to get an utterly strange example how influence can turn against someone watch this:
