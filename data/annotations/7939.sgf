(;B[co];W[bo];B[cn]LB[do:A]C[Is this the right joseki choice?
Az: I don't think so, this is just inviting white to take a bigger corner than 'a' would have, though I think keima instead of C5 would have been better to being with.]
;W[dp];B[eo];W[bn];B[cl]C[Az: This joseki only makes sense if you can keep white seperated...]
;W[bm];B[bl]LB[be:B][ej:A][el:C]C[Az: ... but that's too much to ask. If white just jumps out to 'a' the cutting point looks serious for black, and white also have 'b' in reserve. If black already had a stone somewhere around 'c' (somehow) this would be reasonable, but since the LL corner is already fully alive black is not fighting from a position of strength. The root problem was earlier with the joseki choice.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[ej];B[em]LB[dm:A]C[Az: The fact that black needs to play here is a sign that he has seriously screwed up. 'a' looks like better shape, but there's really no good move here.]
;W[er];B[fr]C[Az: This works as a probe, but taking gote here is out of the question.]
;W[dr]
(;B[gq]C[Az: This has no effect on white and isn't so big. The shape looks like B was trying to be clever, but it's not good. Attacking the weak group in the left hand side is more urgent.]
;W[nq];B[di]TR[gq][nq]C[Az: A good move, but now this exchange looks horrendous.]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[dh];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[fh]
(;B[gi]C[Az: You can hane, the sagari in game is thick but perhaps a little mild.]
;W[ce];B[cd];W[dd]C[Az: Huh? White should use his corner stone to help settle his group, not try to start a second group in the corner. This is a blatant overplay.]
;B[cf];W[be];B[bf];W[ee];B[df];W[bd];B[gf];W[gh];B[hh];W[ff]
;B[fe];W[hg]LB[gg:A]C[Can black cut at A?]
(;B[fg];W[gg];B[je]C[This move seems a bit slack, what would be stronger?

Az: Cut earlier, white was trying for too much here but now that you let w connect it hard to follow up.]
;W[jg];B[lq];W[ih];B[ij]C[I think black should connect at h11 instead of letting white gain strength.

Az: Of course, letting white capture in sente ends any eventual hope of attacking white again.]
;W[hi];B[hj];W[kp]TR[di][dj][dl][ei][em][eo][ep][fi][fr][gi]
[gq][hj][ij]C[How can black best deal with this move?
In the game I was black, and i had no idea how to handle this.

Az: This really quires a two step approach,
Step 1) Make a new pot of tea. If drinking coffee stop and reconsider your choice of beverage; after all, all strong go players drink tea.
Step 2) Black must try to pressure the white stone using thickness. If the upper white group hadn't been allowed to become thick then there would be a potential of a splitting attack, but the slack play there has limited black to transfering his center thickness into thickness to invade / reduce the white right hand side.]

(;B[ko];W[jo];B[jm];W[jn]
(;B[iq];W[ll];B[ln]LB[qh:A]C[This move forces white to become stronger.

Az: Yeah, so why did you do this again? Black missed his chance to attack and reduce earlier, now he should probably just think about something big like 'a']
;W[km]
(;B[rp]C[Is there a better invasion for black?
or should black simply not invade at all?];W[qo];B[pr];W[pq]
;B[qq];W[or];B[rn]C[Az: This is playing with fire in a big way. Black must defend the corner first, if white captures q2 then white is in a very strong position to attack you and your eyespace is weak.]
;W[ro];B[so]
(;W[qm]C[Az: Weak move by your opponent, but the result is still bad for black.]
;B[rr]
(;W[nd]
(;B[nf]C[Is there a better move than this?
I believe black can not allow white to make a moyo there, but is there a different way to attack the single stone and ruin the moyo?

Az: This is unreasonable. Black can only play this way with more thickness nearby, you don't have enough strength for this kind of scorched earth strategy.]
;W[od]
(;B[nc]C[Az: Too easy for white to get away.]
(;W[md];B[pd];W[ke];B[kd];W[le]
(;B[kc];W[pf]C[Black got cut.

Az: Blacks situation is getting worse and worse. Saving the one stone by itself isn't that big, black can think about the attache and crosscut...]
(;B[pg];W[qf];B[oe];W[og];B[pe];W[of]C[White gained a lot of points on the right side. is there any way black could have prevented that?]

(;B[ql];W[qn];B[sn];W[pl];B[jd]C[This is a mistake, black should have played j16. then the game would still be "close".]

C[Brainfart, this is a ko... obviously.])
(;B[qs]C[Az: Black must make life in the corner, since the ko would be a flower ko for white. The game isn't over yet, but it's actually winding down pretty rapidly for black. The reason is that white is fairly secure everywhere, and although he has a little less territory he has more potential for future territory. Black is forced into answering every move which threatens his territory since he doesn't have a flexible set of options anymore. This means that white can keep chipping away at the black territory and b must keep answering. Combined with a group which isn't fully alive, and we can say that blacks situation is actually quite dire. End of comments.]

(;B[di]LB[ci:A][dj:B]C[Az: 'a' and 'b' are obviously miai. White dares not play 'b', so W 'a' - B 'b' forces white to either live small or run out into a B moyo with a weak group. This will hopefully get all of the B stones linked up and working together for center influence.]
))
(;B[dn];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[bn];B[np];W[pn];B[nn]LB[dn:A]
C[Az: This seems like the most consistent strategy for black. White is too low on the left hand side, and all of the black stones are working together. 'a' is the most natural joseki choice for black since it would be hard to seperate white from the 2 stones without starting a running fight you're not prepared for.]
))
(;B[cl]C[Az: The move you played in game is joseki, but I think I'd prefere to play here. Maybe I've just never had good luck with that variation, but if w gets the chance to extend again along the side the 5-4 pt isn't functioning well.]
