;B[pd];W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec];W[qf]C[When black closes the corner  with e17 the left side is the most important
part of the board. Here I would play white d10. That is a move that both is
an extension from the lower left corner and prevents a black extension on
that side.];B[nd];W[pj];B[qn]C[Left side most important for black too. This is not good  IMHO.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[nn]C[Black q8 is more normal];W[jp]C[Maybe a low stone is better here, I don't know. Or maybe m4 as it  has more
effect against the black group.];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn];W[dl]C[This is good for white since it takes  the left side. A continuation
towards the enclosure is very important now, perhaps at c11 or c12.];B[ph]
;W[qh];B[qi]
(;W[qg]C[Mistake. Cutting at q11 is the only move. Letting  white connect there is
very painful, because then the black stone at O6 is suddenly on a good
position. Se variation.];B[pi];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[iq];W[jq];B[ir];W[jr]
;B[lo];W[lp]C[M3 is safer,  and more effective later for protecting the corner from an
invasion.];B[mo]C[Because of m4 it is more or less necessary to answer at this move  too.
Letting white get n4 and then the atari at l4 is very painful.];W[qb]C[This is a big move, but not urgent. It has very little effect on  other
parts of the board. Not answering n5 is a mistake, but even if it wasn't the
area of interest should still be the left side.];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc];W[fr]
C[Also just endgame. It looks impossibe to kill f3.];B[gr];W[er]C[Better not to answer. If black captures at e2 it is gote for  her.]
;B[qq]C[Much bigger than white's endgame moves, but black c10 would be even  more
annoying for white.];W[pq]C[Nothing else to do since the outside is safe.]
;B[ro];W[rn]C[useless.]

;B[no];W[qr];B[ko];W[jo];B[ch]C[Too short. This lets white close the side at  c10 in good shape.]

(;W[df]C[c10 better. See variation. Also in this shape the correct invasion  point
is usually at c14, but here it will just help black secure the upper side.]
;B[eh];W[ff];B[ee];W[ef]C[White is getting heavy.];B[fe];W[gg];B[gh]C[Wrong direction. Black should connect under with b14, or  take points on
the upper side.];W[hh];B[gi];W[ge];B[gd];W[he];B[hd];W[bf];B[cg]C[Useless move, white is  just happy to connect here. White should have no
problem to run away now.];W[cf];B[ie];W[if];B[hf];W[gf];B[jf];W[ig];B[je]
;W[cj]C[Good. Now black is  in trouble, but it seems white has to kill black here
to win the game. Black has secured too much of the upper side already.]

White has about 30 pts on the left, 15 pts on the bottom, 10 pts on the
upper right 3 prisoner and 5.5 komi. A total of about 65 pts.
Black has about 55 pts on the upper side can secure more than 20 pts in the
center right. So black is more than 10 pts ahead now.];W[om]C[Another target for black. Looks very difficult to escape with this  stone.]

since the effect was obvious and immediate. It was just pure luck for white
to win this game. Both black and white was very careless in the later part
of the game. White wins by about 25 pts I think, all mistakes in the end was
larger than that.])

to find the correct spot though. I think I would start with k17 but am not
confident at all about that move. The center is open both from k6, d8 and
r14 so it will be very difficult for black to made territory there]))
