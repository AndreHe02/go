C[hi there

my name is karin and i'm about 11k
thank you for letting this games reviewed. 

i always have difficulties telling when a game is lost on a 9x9 since every stone has such a huge impact.
however i don't think that a stone as early as stone 6 (your third stone) is responsible for your loss, it is way too early... 
even with the mistakes you mentioned later in the game, there are ways to probably rescue the game

i added quite many variations (look at the bottom of this window)
if you want to see where things may lead, please feel free to look at all of them.
however, if you are overwhelmed by those many variations, PLEASE do NOT look at all of them. in tis case kust go a few (2-3) steps into the variations, to get s feeling what it is all about.

overall:
your style is stil focused on details instead of the big picture, but you create nice shapes every now and then

my tips for you:
- learn, how a proper eye looks 
- learn to focuse on the big picture... what is important? -> primarily territory !! and secondly staying alive (=territory)
- cutting and inveading the enemy is worth nothing if he still has more territory than you
- lean back and think about what stone black would want to play, if it was his turn ;-)]

(;W[de]C[I think this was a mistake, I should have played c7 or c6 or d7 or d6 or something.

probably c6 is the best one here

there are still many possibilities in this situation, not the biggest mistake ever made ;-)]
;B[cc]C[do you see how black is going for the corners? 
corners are important!
it is easy to gain territory in a corner, an therefore it's easy to live there, if it comes to this]

(;W[cb]TR[gd]C[so much better! (except black finds d4)

it attacks black
it secures e8 
it creates many possibilities what to play so that black has to answer (that's alwas a good thing when you act and your opponent has no other choice than to react)

black has no space to live in that upper right corner... so please be aware of the dangerous cut at g6]

however, if i may say so... on your level it is often save to assume, that the opponent, who has  little experience,too, will play in an area, where you have played or where he has last played 
i hope that makes sense
i assume d4 is counter-intuitive especially for a beginner]
