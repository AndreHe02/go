C[Hi.  This was a game I felt was out of control early on.  I do not like playing against enemy frameworks and I think I let White gain too much influence in the center.  I played Black.

Please help!

LB[pn:A]C[So there must be some weakness White is not covering here because he didn't play at A (Q6).

Breakfast: A is an old fashion. Nowadays we usually skip it]

(;B[nc]C[I should have played this at O16 to counteract the moyo.

Breakfast: Hard to say what is better. Personally I like keima answer more]
;W[mo];B[mq]LB[cn:A]C[Slow? I thought about approaching the corner at the bottom left.

Breakfast: It was solid, but tennuki is possible too];W[cf]
;B[ch]C[Good choice];W[ef];B[fd];W[di]C[After this joseki, I thought Black's position is too low, and White's position is very strong.

[dr][lr][or][ds][ls]C[After a Black play at A, counting territory inside the triangles, Black has 60 points.

White has 33 points but a lot of thickness - I would estimate at least 25 points plus sente after I play at A.

Where did Black fall behind?

Breakfast: Your cut was too early, but any way, the game is playable]

(;B[mf]LB[mf:B][of:A]C[A-B exchange is pure gain for White.

Breakfast: Yes, but Black has no choice -];W[hc]C[I didn't know how to handle this stone, but I wanted to cover the 3-3 invasion somehow.
