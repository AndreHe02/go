C[> Thanks for reviewing my game I resighned near the end because It was appereant when I lost but I though it would be a good game for review so thanks in advance

Hi, 

I'm Frederic(bouquetf or youshe), I'll review your game. I'm about 7/8k on KGS and DGS.
Your comments will follow the ">"
Hope you'll enjoy
Feel free to ask if you have any question

Cheers];B[pd];W[pp];B[dp];W[dd]
(;B[np]TR[nq]C[It's quiet stange to approch a 4/4 point with a stone on the 4th line. O3 would me more common.

The reason behind this is that a stone on the 4th line is influence oriented and a stone on the 3rd line will be for territory.
Here, as the hoshi (4/4) is aiming at influence on both side, you should approch to get territory. See variations for common josekis]
;W[pn]C[> I chose this joseki because I wanted to keep sente and build a double wing formation on the left side of the board]
;B[pq]C[This kind of moves would be more common white stone on the 3-4 point.]
;W[qq];B[oq];W[qr]
(;B[iq]C[It's a bit far, see variation.];W[qj];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd]
;W[cc];B[dk]TR[ci]SQ[cq]C[A bit far away, C11 would be the move. 
By the way, a san-san (3-3) invasion here would make you heavy]
;W[nc]C[> her I thought if I could keep my territory on the left and some in the middle then as long as I could keep a group in the top right alive I could win

It's early to think you can win, you still have weaknesses in your territory, but you can build a nice moyo :)]

(;B[qh]SQ[qf]C[this is dangerous and welcome something around R14]
;W[qf]C[> my first double pincer Im not sure if i handled it correctly]

(;B[pf]C[it's a good answer if you want to link your stones]

(;W[rg]
(;B[re]C[> trying ot make a base

It's strange, I tried some variations, not sure which one is better]

(;W[rh];B[lc]LB[hc:A][fe:B]C[> I thought this would be a good move because it would make whites stone run and I could make a base with the next move and maybe later in the game play at B

not sure it's the right time to attack as your group on the right still have some weaknesses]

(;W[ne]
(;B[mg]TR[nm]C[> I abondoned that plan because I though that was making an even better base with influince

It's dangerous as it creates more weaknesses. If you want to build a moyo, I think something around O7 would be better, but it will become urgent to help your top right group]
;W[lf]
(;B[ke]LB[me:A]C[> I was hoping to later play at A and thought i w1as strighning my black stone at M17

it can help white I think.
When you want to attack, the general principle is at distance, and always to build something
If you wanted to cut, see variation]
(;W[pc];B[qc];W[od];B[pb];W[pe]
(;B[of]C[dangerous as your corner may die];W[qd]C[> big mistake]

(;B[pi]C[It's strange I think, but why not]
(;W[jc]C[> that on hurt

What happened here is only because you tried to kill earlier, see variations after stone 26]
;B[jd];W[id]

(;B[me]C[I don't think you can cut here];W[mf];B[nf]C[> I saw I had tramendous influince and though I could win with the center alone]

(;W[kh];B[kf];W[mc];B[lg];W[nd]C[> I as suprise it worked I just wanted the outside influince

[hc:5][cd:4][qe:8][dh:3][gi:6][do:1][pp:2]C[Ok, a few words for the end and some hints for the futur.

- Always take care of your weak groups. It should be a priority
- When you build a moyo, remember it welcomes fight and invasion. The right strategy is to use your moyo to attack oponent invasion while building big territory. Basicaly, it's the same strategy when attacking.
- Extend of heigh +1 (1 and 2)
- Remember good (4-6) and Bad (7-8) shapes
- Train your reading skills, it's what will make the difference. Tsumegos (life and death problems) will help.

I think you can win several stones and become 10k quiet fast if you remember and apply those principles. 

Hope you enjoyed the review, good luck for your next games.
