RE[B+8.5]

;B[pp];W[dc];B[dp];W[oc]C[doviende [17k\]: I wanted to try out some opening moves that weren't 4-4.  i thought i'd experiment a bit.

CHOI: You could try R16 if you don't want Q16. Both stones at line 3 (i.e. line 17) is not good.]
;B[qe];W[ld];B[pj];W[ce]C[CHOI: All white stones are confined in a congested area. I would perfer C6, C10 or K3.
I think K3 is better.];B[fc]C[CHOI: I would perfer K4 if I hold black stone.]
;W[hc]C[doviende [17k\]: maybe J17 would have been a better move here?

CHOI : H17 is O.K. because you have so many white stones here.]
;B[fe];W[he];B[eg];W[cg];B[ei];W[cn]C[doviende [17k\]: this move doesn't feel right to me, for some reason.  Maybe D7 instead?  I want to be able to chase those black stones at F11 later, but i also want to use the opportunity to approach the corner.  If there's another strategy that would be more beneficial at this time, i'd like to hear about that too

CHOI : I would perfer G13, or E9 and continue to attack black stones and then P14 in later stage.]
;B[cl];W[en];B[fp];W[dl];B[dk];W[el];B[ek];W[gm]C[doviende [17k\]: i wasn't sure that i had enough to make that E6 group live, so i thought i'd add another stone and make sure i had lots of access to the center too.  In hindsight, maybe that group had enough opportunities open that i could come back to it later, and play something in the bottom center right now instead of G7.  any thoughts?

CHOI : C9, and you have great chance to take away the black stone C8. Your stones will be safe and keep attacking the other 6 nos. of black stones on the left.]
;B[ho];W[nq]C[CHOI : The priority is to keep your 5 white stones at left be safe and keep attacking the 7 black stones. Try C9 !]
;B[kq]C[doviende [17k\]: Now after these last 2 black moves at H5 and L3, it feels like black has quite a large space there, and i'm just running for cover....this comes back to haunt me later


CHOI: It is not as big as you though. You still have the right to share half of the left corner.]
;W[lp]C[CHOI : I would prefer O5. After white M4, black L4, the area on the left is almost sure be black's space while the two white stones are still un-safe.]
;B[kp];W[oo]C[doviende [17k\]: i think that here i wanted to play towards the middle instead of moving towards the corner, but perhaps that was a bad idea with black on the 4-4 spot

CHOI : I would try R3 and get the stones safe first. It is not desired as you have two groups of un-safe stones.]
;B[po];W[on];B[qm];W[oe]C[CHOI : I think it is  better try G3, or some area around there first, keep attack the black stones and you will have better chance to enclose a big space from the top to centre.

However, the priority is to keep the two groups of white stones at the bottome safe.]
;B[qc];W[pg];B[qg];W[ph];B[qh];W[ni];B[hg]C[CHOI : Could you see why I suggest try G13 first?]
;W[if];B[ig];W[jg];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[lh];B[li];W[mh];B[lj]
;W[nk]C[CHOI : There isn't too much space in the rigth, I would perfer G9 or H9]
;B[nj];W[oj];B[mj];W[pi];B[ok];W[qj];B[oi];W[oh];B[oj];W[qi]
;B[ri];W[rl]C[CHOI : S8 is too small. G9, Q2, B4, C9 etc. are better choice.]
;B[rm];W[ql];B[hm];W[gl];B[hl];W[fk];B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[hj]
;B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[gh];B[fi];W[hh];B[gg];W[cj];B[ci];W[ck]
;B[dj];W[cm]C[CHOI : B8 is the only choice ! and then you win this game.]
;B[bl];W[bi];B[bj];W[ch];B[di];W[bm];B[bh];W[bg];B[ai];W[bp]
;B[cq];W[bq];B[cr];W[lo]LB[hq:A]C[doviende [17k\]: here i'm beginning to think that i should have done the opening better so that i'd have more room to move.  The area all around A seems so large, but it looks too late now to do anything about it.

CHOI : Please note that both black and white could occupy space. As far as your space is larger than the black. It is O.K. You space on top is larger than black's space on bottom ! Think about the right bottome corner now.It is really big if black could get the whole space by using 4 stones only.]
;B[kn];W[ko];B[jo];W[ln];B[km];W[lm];B[nl];W[ml]C[CHOI : I would perfer  Q2 instead of save one stone.]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[mk];W[mn];B[ll];W[ol];B[mm];W[pl];B[oq]C[CHOI : If you compare the botttom right hand side and bottom left hand side of black stones, you will note that the space in the right is only a little less than the left. But black just use 5 stones on the right while black use 8 stones on the left. If you try Q2 first, you have a better chance to win this game.]
;W[nr];B[or];W[lq];B[kr];W[go];B[gp];W[fo];B[do]C[CHOI : you could ignore this one and try P1, Q18, T7, A8, B2 etc.]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[gn]C[CHOI: G6 is not good enough. I think P1, B2, Q18  etc.are better]

;B[sn]C[CHOI : you could try S6 in this instance and may have a little more benefit]
;W[sl];B[qn];W[pm]C[CHOI : A8, P1, B2 etc. better than Q7.]

CHOI : I think you lost not becacuse of the "big" space of black in the bottom, but because you have not shared the space in the left and right bottom corner.
