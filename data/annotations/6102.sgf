C[Dear Reviewer,




When reviewing this game on my own, I noticed that I made a lot of mistakes-in other words, a typical sloppy game of mine. I was certain that I'd lose by a lot, but as the results say, white won only by 3.5 points. The problem is, I cannot pinpoint many of my opponent's mistakes. Please review for both sides.

I don't see why. Main problem is you are ending in gote here. The attack is a failure.]
