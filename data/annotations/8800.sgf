C[This is a record of a game played between Derek Willer (W, ~20k?) and Kevin Stephens (B, ~25k?) The game was played in person and  started at 2:25PM on the 24th of May, 2012 and lasted until 4:45 the same day. W won via resignation partially due to time restraints.

Derek: Hello, just recently started getting into Go and have been trying to do all that I can to improve. Just want to get some general comments about the gameplay in this match.]
;B[op]C[pz-
hi! i'm pzykr and i'm 9 kyu (under a different name) on KGS. all my comments will be preceeded with  pz- to make them easy to spot and will preceed comments already made.
first thing: please set your .sgf viewer to show all move numbers. for the most part, i will refer to move numbers instead of the board locations of stones (with some exceptions, prolly). b1 is black's first move, here played on P4. all board locations will be identified with a CAPITAL letter and a number; all moves numbers will be _lower case_ b or w and the move number.
since you and your opponent are both beginners i'll include a lot of general comments on go, especially the opening, and not just respond move-by-move. i hope you will find this helpful!]
;W[cp];B[pm];W[dd];B[ke]C[pz- this is a very unusual opening.
white has played on usual points; black has played very unusually.
first: b1 on P4 is playable but rare. most times one doesn't venture beyond four points from either side of a corner, but might play on the fifth line if he or she has a specific strategy in mind. the move emphasizes the side instead of the corner, in this case, the bottom side. white can invade this corner and live.
in general, good opening play usually follows the go proverb, "corners are golden, sides are silvery; the center is as a useless piece of straw."
this is because of the efficiency (a very important concept!) of playing in the corner, especially, and to a less extent on the side. the reason it is efficient is because of the presence of the edges of the board, which makes it easier to secure territory in the corners. it's a bit more difficult to secure territory on the side, and quite difficult to create territory in the center.
in this game, b5 is just a bad move. not only does it neglect the  upper right corner, but being past the fourth line, it can be considered more a center move than a side move. white can easily play underneath, at L17 [underneath always means towards the edge of the board and has nothing to do with the fact that in general orientation, L17 is actually above b5\].]
;W[od]C[pz- good. this takes advantage of b's poor choice of b5 by occupying the last corner, though again, being on the 4-5 point, it is a rather unusual corner move. if the strategy is to use this stone against b5 then this choice of moves make perfect sense...]
;B[jn];W[md]C[pz- w clearly seems to be focusing on b5. note that  the upper right corner can be invaded successfully. also, w6 and w8 aren't very good at making territory. however, as an attack against b5, this is an excellent move, especially because it attacks from some distance and not by trying to attach directly to b5. proverb: "do not touch a stone you are attacking." don't take this too literally, as eventually fighting takes place with contact moves: but it is very good practice to attack first from some distance so later contact moves have support.]
;B[jd]C[pz- only w2 has been played on the third line. it is generally good practice to have a balance between third and fourth line stones.  third line stones make it easier to make territory on the side; fourth line stones have more influence on the center of the board.
the third line is called "the line of territory." the fourth line is called "the line of influence." the second line is called "the line of defeat" because it doesn't enclose very much territory.]
;W[pi]TR[eq]C[pz- this is called an "extension" as it can be seen as extending from w's stones in the upper right corner. all the corners have at least one stone and now may be an appropriate time to extend on the sides. many folks would prefer to complete the shape in the lower left corner before extending onto the side. to complete the shape in the lower left, w might play the small knight's move at E3 (triangle). this shape is called a "shimari" and secures the corner. once the corner is secured, the shape is said to be "settled" which means it's alive or cannot be prevented from making life (with proper play).
notice that b still could invade the upper right corner and live-even get quite a bit of territory-so w6 and w8 are not "settled."
same applies to b's bottom right: the shape is not settled. one would expect, from the b stones being on the fourth line, that the strategy for b emphasizes the center of the board. this is not necessarily a bad thing: it depends on whether b uses these stones properly in harmony with their placement on "the line of influence."]
;B[fn];W[ep]C[pz- on the contrary, derek (re: your note below): w has a big advantage at this point. w12 is a good alternative to the shimari discussed earlier. it should be noted, though, that both upper corners can be successfully invaded. playing on the fourth line to secure center influence is viable, but again, some balance of territory-securing moves is also good.


Derek: At this point I felt that I had a rather intense disadvantage. Black had a large portion of territory mapped out on the bottom and right, and had done a lot to reduce me in the upper right. I decided that my best approach would be to try and strengthen what I had and hope that his positions remained unstable. This was a very weak strategy in my mind, as it relied on my opponent making mistakes or weak plays.]
;B[dm]C[pz- b has not one stone below the fourth line. "the center is as a useless piece of straw." that part of the proverb is true because the three lowest lines of the board (that is, the outside edges and the two lines up from each edge) have more points than the rest of the board combined.]
;W[ec]TR[hc]C[pz- another proverb: "beginners play diagonal moves." more experienced players also make diagonal moves, of course, but not without good reason. in this case, w14 does not secure the corner and is just too close to w4 to be efficient. these two stones might be called "overconcentrated." w14 does have the virtue, though, of being the second move of the game below the fourth line.
no one has yet "made a base" or even come close enough for me to have an opportunity to comment on this important concept. so i'll just take this opportunity to bring it up. disregarding the w4 stone for a moment... from w14 if white were to extend two points towards the right and play a stone at H17-at triangle-(i'm aware that it's not w's move---bear with me:) then white would have made "a base." oten in games between experienced players one side or both would have made a base by now. a base comprises two stones on the third line with two empty points between them. a base is not quite alive but is very difficult to kill and very often forms the basis of a living group.]
;B[gq]C[pz- b's first move below the fourth line and a good move, at it occupies a point that restricts w's potential to make territory by extending from w12 to around H3. now, w needs to worry about having his corner taken away from him, especially with b's looming b11 and b13...]
;W[kc]C[pz- this kind of move, ignoring what is going on in the bottom left and moving elsewhere, is called "tenuki." as far as w16 itself goes, this creates a good bit of potential to secure territory along with w6 and w8. however, i'm not sure tenuki is the right strategy against the attack on w's lower left, unless w thinks he or she can gain more by playing elsewhere and just letting the two w stones in the corner die. even if w does live in the lower left, he or she stands a good chance of being "sealed in" by b so that it's not possible to expand for more territory or connect with groups in the center.]
;B[og]C[pz- another play inside the "useless piece of straw" center, though it does attack w10 in such a way that b5 and b9 have some (distant) influence on the shape. on the other hand, b17 is very vulnerable to a w move at N14, "cutting" it from the other two stones.]
;W[jc]C[pz- not an aggressive move but since it "cashes in" on some side territory it seems ok. the aggressive move would be at N14, isolating and attacking b17. well, actually i guess N14 would also isolate the two weak b stones at b5 and b9. "cutting" and "connecting" are very important tactics to learn and master on the way to getting better in go!]
;B[je]TR[ie]C[pz- i do not understand the purpose of this move---and NO move should ever be made without at least one (preferably more) purpose(s)!
but this move does give me the opportunity to talk about shape. this shape, b5, b9, b19, is called an "empty triangle" and is the first example always given in go books of "bad shape." why? it's inefficient. why? let's look just at the three black stones for a moment and ignore the white stones-actually pretend they aren't there. count the liberties this b group has (and include the point where w18 is because we're pretending the w stones aren't there:)
did you count 7 libeties? good!
now, let's pretend b19 was played with "good shape" at J15 (triangle). now count the liberties-ignoring both w18 and b19. eight liberties, right? harder to kill! further, this shape (called a "tiger's mouth") completely protects K15 from a w move there-suicide! it's a legal move, since it would still have one liberty, but not often a good move since that one liberty can immediately be occupied by b, capturing the w stone.
further: the empty triangle does not have much potential to make an eye, while the tiger's mouth definitely does. this ugly clump of b stones, this "empty triangle," might be described as "heavy" and overconcentrated.]
;W[hd]C[pz-indeed. w has now secured quite a bit of territory at the top. on the other hand, b has little in the way of territory, though he or she has some potential for center territory and at the bottom. again, it's quite difficult to make solid territory in the center because all four sides must be surrounded whereas in the corner only two sides must be surrounded and on the side, three.

Derek: I'm pleased with how this arrangement turned out for me, giving me very strong control over the top. Again, though, it felt like I was playing my opponents weakness instead of making the best choices.]
;B[id];W[ic];B[pg]C[pz- (in response to derek's comment below) on the other hand, these two b stones (b17 and b23) are too close together, do not stake out territory, and have zero eye-space potential. they do, however, effectively isolate w10, which is being surrounded from afar (including b3) and should either be sacrified or protected. sacrificing it-a way of "playing lightly"- is a viable option though not necessarily the best strategy. this would be a good time for w to play at N14, let b eat the w10 stone or play into the corner, but having the heavy b group at the top cut off and vulnerable.

Derek: Black starts an invasion on the upper right that starts to really worry me, I think my responses are very weak and not thought out.]
;W[qf]C[pz- believe it or not, the upper right corner is still vulnerable to a successful invasion. as an attempt to help out w10 w24 is not very effective...]
;B[pe]C[pz- yes! good move. this cuts w6 and w24. also, these three black stones (b17, b23, and b25) make good shape: count the liberties! these three stones have more liberties than the four b stones at the top (again, ignore the presence of w stones for the sake of the point).]
;W[pd];B[qe];W[qg]C[pz- definitely, derek! R16 is "the only move."


Derek: Here I think R16 might have been better? Weakening the right side to secure the corner.]
;B[qi];W[ph];B[pj];W[qh];B[ri];W[rh];B[qj];W[re];B[rd];W[pf]
;B[oe];W[of];B[qd];W[sf];B[sh];W[sg];B[si];W[rf]C[pz- W46 is a completely useless move--might as well have passed!  much better would have been O14, "sticking your head out." notice: this w group has only one eye...


Derek: The sequence definitely gave B a very strong position here, forcing me to try and survive. I came out alright, and with good stones for use later but I think it was a lot of wasted time, could have been played better from the beginning.]
;B[sd];W[ng];B[pc];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob];B[oa];W[na];B[pa];W[nb]
;B[ne];W[me];B[nd];W[mc];B[mf];W[nf];B[lf]C[pz- there is a lot of "aji" in the upper right corner. aji literally means "taste" in japanese, but in go it refers to latent possibilities that could have implications or consequences after more moves have been made.


Derek: The upper right is pretty much finished and I came out on top, but again I think it was moreso that I made plays anticipating him making a bad choice.]
;W[gp]C[pz-my intention in this review has been to try to explain basic principles of good opening play. we have moved into the middle game now. i hope the foregoing comments have been useful and, as they are rather extensive, hope i might be forgiven for stopping here...  (except for one last comment at the last move)

good wishes for rapid improvement and years of gratifying games :)

Derek: I decided that I would try jumping around and attempt to invade him, hopefully flustering him by penetrating all his weak spots.]
;B[hq];W[fq];B[fo];W[fp];B[dn];W[bn];B[eo];W[dp];B[fl];W[ei]
C[Derek: The sequence in the lower left came out very beneficial for me, and this last play at E11 I feel was quite a powerful play, perhaps my best of the game?]
;B[bl];W[lg];B[kg];W[mg];B[oh];W[ni];B[lj];W[li];B[mj];W[gr]
;B[ip];W[hr];B[ir];W[is];B[js];W[hs]C[Derek: Decently solidified the lower left, though again if this had been a stronger player I would have easily lost all of this early on.]
;B[jr];W[nj];B[nl];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[gj];W[hi]C[Derek: Here my thoughts were to try and build a framework to close on in the black stones centered around L15.]
;B[fi];W[fh];B[ej];W[gi];B[gm];W[if];B[jg];W[jf];B[hg];W[he]
;B[hf];W[ig];B[ih];W[ie];B[gf];W[kf];B[fe];W[le];B[mk];W[qp]
C[Derek: Again attempting to invade his territory and force him into replying, drawing his focus away from the upper portion for a while.]
;B[po];W[pp];B[on];W[oq];B[np];W[nq];B[lq];W[mq];B[lo];W[lr]
;B[kq];W[mr];B[mp];W[qo];B[rm];W[qn];B[pn];W[qm];B[ql];W[jh]
C[Derek: Again I am pleased with the sequence in the lower right, however I feel throughout it all that were it a stronger player it would not have worked.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[hh];W[ef];B[hj];W[gh];B[eg];W[ee];B[fj];W[ge]
;B[ff];W[eh];B[dh];W[di];B[ch];W[fd];B[ci];W[dg];B[fg];W[ji]
;B[dj];W[gg]TR[fr]C[pz- here we are at move 160; there has been, at the bottom, a situation since move w90 that just screams for attention! if b91 had been played at F2 (triangle) the four stones would have died. these four stones have been hanging around vulnerable for almost half the game! on any one of the ensuing 69 moves, b could have played here and killed those stones. this is a shape that one learns early in his or her go career... w must connect at F2.

thank you for giving me this opportunity to review another game for the GTL. i hope reading this review does you as much good as writing it has done me!

Derek: B resigned here, and he lost the this liberty battle because he had mismatched the concept of a liberty battle and seki and was under the impression that it would have been a stalemate.

Thank you for looking through this game and I look forward to seeing your comments!]
