C[Dear Reviewer:
I apreciate you time and interest.
I played aysen 18k* IGS, black.
I´ve got the impression, after reviewing the game myself, that I was all the time behind white.
At the beginning he secured 2 corners (UL and LL), and was able to continue attacking, whith myself trying to defend my unsecure groups.  My biggest mistake (from all the many) was letting him push in through my left side moyo (move 84), I think.  And I also realized I started playing end game moves to early on the game, while he continued playing middle game moves.  I also played many ineffective and thank you moves.  This made it much esaier for him to attack, and latter shrink my influence on the center.  I now the match wasn´t close, but I´d apreciate a review so as to clarify my most frecuent mistakes.
Thank you, aysen.];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[ec];W[dc];B[ed]
;W[gc];B[dj]LB[ce:A][ge:B]C[matt>  This is to wide of an extension, you should attack one of the two
white groups. A move at c15 or g15 would strengthen your 2 stones
while attacking.];W[cg]C[matt> now white takes advantage, this move takes a large amount of territory,
strengthens the corner, and seperates the 3 black stones];B[co]

C[matt> this turned out terrible for black. You got a small corner and white got a lot of outside influence. Your main goal should have been to seperate the white stones.
As long as you can get to the center, living in the corner is not that important]

(;B[lc];W[jd]C[matt>  This is bad for black. there are 3 weak black groups. you should only pincer
here if you are strong in the upper right. white k16 has strengthened whites g17 stone
in the bargain ;-(];B[le];W[ne];B[pf];W[kc];B[lb]C[matt> this is better at n17 or m16]
;W[kd]C[matt> uggly move for white. if white is going to peep, n16 is much better.
Either way, black should respond.];B[dd];W[cc];B[fb];W[gb];B[eg]

;B[mm];W[lm];B[ll]C[matt> this is bad for black. It looks like you are trying to seperate two live white groups.
In the process white walks into your center territory. better to secure your territory,
