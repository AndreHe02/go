C[My main question on this game is how to avoid letting my opponent construct a "moyo of death" like he did here.

Michael:  Hi there, I'll be reviewing your game today.  Most of your mistakes seem to be in which direction that you push your opponent and white stones you choose to attack.  I would recommend reading the book "Attack and Defense" and "Direction of Play" if you can get them.

Both you and your opponent also each made a massive endgame blunder, I did point this out, keep an eye out for those shape problems in the future.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]LB[pk:C][qk:B][ep:D][fq:A]C[A through D is also thinkable.]
;W[nc]C[I found this move odd.  By not responding, white is offering you the chance to work a 5-4 joseki on the top left.]
;B[qg]LB[pf:A][qf:B]C[A or B is more normal.  This move leaves weaknesses behind.]
;W[jp]
(;B[ic]TR[pd][de]C[This move is kind of vague.  It's not really helping either of your groups,  It's trying to do both, but it's not doing either very well.]
;W[kc];B[fc]TR[dc][de]C[This shape is also questionable for a 5-4 joseki]
;W[ce]
(;B[cf]LB[ed:A]C[This leaves a big weakness at A.  I'm not sure what's best from here.  I left some ideas as variations.]
;W[ed];B[cd];W[cc]
(;B[bd];W[dj]TR[cc][dc][kc][nc][ed]SQ[fc][ic]C[Should I have put some pressure on his territory instead  of protecting mine?

Michael: You have many variations on this move for some reason.  They all look like reasonable moves.

White's stone on the 3-3 is making nice territory, but it's not uninvadable and it's not unreducable.  For now, I would suggest letting white have his territory for right now and harrassing one of his weak groups.  Both of the marked groups are weak and can be killed if white isn't careful.

You plan isn't really to kill the groups, but chase them and gain territory at the same time.

Right now you also have a weak group.  So first you need to fix your weaknesses, then attack.]
(;B[qm]LB[pn:C][qn:D][po:B][qo:A]C[This move is a bit too far away from your corner to be effective.  A-D are normal.  I recommend A and B though, because it is very difficult to exploit them.]
;W[oo]C[White pokes at your weakness immediately.];B[po];W[oq]
(;B[co]C[I played here because I thought i could use something from the black stones on the top left? Where should I have played?

Michael:  First off, you probably shouldn't have tenuki'd so early.  But also I think you played on the wrong side of the white stone.]

Michael: This is the correct way to play.  It was a mistake to tenuki so early, this is the best result you can expect from playing elsewhere so soon.]

(;W[nm];B[nl];W[fj];B[ll];W[ol];B[pm];W[ml];B[nk]C[His moyo of most of the bottom half of the board seems impregnable to me. Should I have tried harder to invade it or focused on stabilizing my own territory more [or something else\]? What I ended up doing just stabilized his territory.

Michael: One of the hardest things in Go is learning from which direction you should attack something.  Something that I've heard from dan level players is that a go game is like water.  If block water it just flows around you, so you want to direct the water (and your opponents stones) where you want them to be.

It's probably just happenstance that your opponent got his moyo.  But you should look for stuff like that in the future.]

Michael:  You are down by quite a bit right now.  But a good end game might be able to make that up.  You have a large right side and a reasonable left side, and the top is still up for grabs.]
