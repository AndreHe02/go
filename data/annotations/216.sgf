;B[dp];W[qd];B[od];W[ld];B[qc];W[pf]L[rc][pc][re]C[This move should be  at White 'a' followed by Black 'b' and White 'c'. Then White get a base in  the corner and the Black stones are still weak.]
;B[nf]L[rd][pd]C[Black  should play 'a' or perhap
s 'b'. That is the easy way of taking control of the corner and make White  weak.]
;W[ph]L[rc]C[This is a good point but White 'a' is bigger since  it take half the corner and lessen blacks eyeshape.]
;B[qj]C[This is  often a strong way to attack
 but I would prefer to play in the corner.];W[pd]M[od][qd][qc][sj]C[In  this shape (the marked stones) it is often bad to play like this. White risk  to make his stones heavy and does not get any territory from this move.]
;B[pc];W[nc]L[oc]C[This move is bad because now White cannot cut at 'a' anymore.]
;B[oc];W[ng];B[og]C[This move does not look good.white will  capture it or cut through Blacks position.]
;W[of]C[Good];B[pg]C[This is a strange move but th
e situation is getting complicated and it is difficult for me to see what is  best.]
;W[qg];B[oh];W[ne];B[nd]L[mf][rd]C[Black is  very inconsistent. He cannot allow White to capture at 'a'. Later if the  upper Black group is surrou
nded he can live with 'a'.];W[mf];B[qh];W[nh]L[pi]C[This  is a bad move - it forces Black to capture the single white stone. Even if  White cannot play at 'a' immediately he should play elsewhere and wait for a  good opportunity to do so
.];B[oi]M[nh]C[This move make Black very strong in the lower right  part of the board. The marked white stone has no value because it is too  close to the "ponnuki"-capture just above it.]
;W[mc];B[qf];W[qe];B[rf];W[re];B[sf];W[rc];B[rb];W[sb];B[ra];W[ob];B[pb]
;W[oa]C[Black forced White to kill his own stones!  White should be very happy.]
;B[me];W[oe];B[sa];W[rd]L[se]C[White could play
 'a' instead threatening to capture three Black stones.];B[sc];W[pe];B[sd]
C[Black connects because of White's mistake.];W[le];B[pa];W[md];B[nb];W
[mb];B[na];W[cn]L[dn]C[Perhaps 'a' is a  better strategic point since it work better with the central thickness.]
;B[ck];W[en];B[fp];W[ch]C[A good move White  cannot allow Black to extend in this direction. Now White can use the  thickness in the following fight.]
;B[ek];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq]C[This move is not  urgent. The center fight is more important.]
;B[bm]C[Perhaps Black  should jump in the center trying to erase the White thickness.]
;W[cm];B[bl]C[This exchange help  black more than White.];W[dj];B[dk];W
[cr]L[fi][gk]C[White could attack in the center instead with 'a' or 'b' or something.  Black will probably defend himself and depending what happens later White can  play this point afterwards.]
;B[dr];W[bs];B[cp]C[A very Ugly move.];W[co]L[eq]C[Now  White can play at 'a' and get away with it!]
;B[fn];W[hq]L[fm][qm];B[kq]C[This is also a good attacking move. It is very well  balanced to the Black stones on
 the right side.];W[fr]L[eq]C[White 'a' would be more severe I think.  Now Black can defend his shape.]
;B[er]L[eo]C['a' would be more  efficient since it defend all the Black stones.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[gp];B[eo]C[at las
t Black get the vital point. The White group in the corner is getting very  weak now.]
;W[hn];B[go];W[ho];B[ko]L[em][ar]C[If  Black play 'a' he threaten to kill White with 'b'.]
;W[nq]C[White  insist on having as many weak st
ones as possible...];B[oq];W[or];B[pr];W[kr];B[nr]L[jr][lr]C[Black cannot ignore Whites last move he should play 'a' or  'b'. It is big to capture this stone but is not urgent.]
;W[mr];B[os];W[jq]C[White p
rofit a lot from this sacrifice.];B[lq];W[lr];B[mq];W[ok]L[mj][em]
[fi]C[This is another dangerous move. White should perhaps  play 'a' or 'b' or 'c'.]
;B[pk]L[pl][mj]C[Black is kind. At least he  should play 'a' which defend mo
re territory. And he should consider an attack with 'b'.];W[pm]C[
 sheng 28k*: is entering byo-yomi
This is very dangerous.];B[pn]C[This is a very bad way to attack.  Never play contact move against a weak stone!!!
Black should try to surround the white stones or cut them.];W[om]C[Suddenly white group is much stronger and all the three stones are safely  connected.]
;B[ni]C[Black should had played here immediately then White  would had a harder time to ge
t away.];W[on]C[Black suffers even more from the contact play. I repeat:  Never attack weak stones with contact plays like this!]
;B[oo];W[qn]C[This result is really untolerable for black. Do I have to repeat  why? :-)]
;B[po];W[lm]C[Good move. White got a good start for this dangerous little adventure into  Black's thick area.]
;B[qo];W[rn];B[cc]L[dc]C['a' would  make it more difficult for white to get a huge territory on the upper side.]
;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[db];W[eb];B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[bb]L[cb]C['a' is also life and much bigger.]
;W[ee]L[da][ij];B[fc];W[fb]C[Now White get an  opportunity to play the atari first. The r
ule here is "Force before defending".];B[gc];W[hd];B[hc]L[ec]C[White has some problems since  Black can cut with 'a' and completely ruin this area.]
;W[ic];B[fe]C[Black have to cut, that should be good enough.];W[gd]C[This  is bad the since the two whit
e stones get heavy after the Black connection. Just because a move is sente  it does not mean it is profitable.]
;B[fd];W[da]C[At last the  atari before defending against the cut.];B[cb]
;W[af]L[ec]C[This  move is very bad since Bla
ck can cut at 'a' and connect all his stones in a strong group. After that  the two black stones would not be important for black anymore and it would be  a gote move if White capture them.]
;B[bd]C[Black misses his  oportunity. But even if White got a
way with it, this exchange has not improved the position for White. White  took a big risk for nothing. The hane should be played in the endgame since  Black does not have any good move in that local area, which White want to  take away.]
;W[ff];B[ge];W[ec]C[At last...];B[he]L[id]C[Very bad. Black help White to defend against a Black cut at 'a'. Black  can capture the stone above 'a' if he play at 'a'.]
;W[id]C[Now Black  is very heavy (he has no way to get eyes locally and it  is a long road to the nearest Black safe group. If White play well White  could perhaps get the chance to start a double attack against this group and  the middle left Black group.]
;B[gf]L[gg][hg]M[he][ge]C[This is bad  shape when Black has the two ma
rked stones he has to play 'a' or 'b' since trying to get out in the center  as fast as possible. This move would have been good if Black had not played  the atari (the right marked stone) preparing to cut.]
;W[fg];B[hh];W[mi]L[mj][fm]C[
I do not understand this move if Black answers at 'a' the White group below  his hurt. I think White could play the move at 'a' instead. It look dangerous  but if Black cannot capture any of the two white stones Black will have three  weak groups too look af
ter, and that is normally one too much...];B[lh]C[There is no reason  to peep here; it give White to many good options.]
;W[li]L[mj]C[White  could also play at 'a' which look strange but it improves the shape of the  right side White group. If B
lack cuts White can ignore that and attack in the center.];B[kh];W[ki];B
[ji];W[gg]L[hg]C[This kind of move is a little vulgar  it removes the possibility to play 'a' later. The move 'a' does not work now.  But in a future situati
on that could change. This push is absolute sente and that means that it will  probably be sente later as well so White could start a large scale attack or  something and play this move (if he still wants to) later.]
;B[hg];W[if];B[ie]L[jh]C[I guess that the peep aimed at 'a'. But the timing is perhaps not the  best since Black can afford to sacrifice two stones if he save the rest of  his stones.]
;W[je]L[jf]C[White is strong here so he should play 'a'  instead leaving him the aji (p
ossibility) of a cut and no weaknesses for Black to use.];B[hf]L[jf]
C[Black can capture the peeping stone with 'a'. Please verify for yourself.]
;W[jf]M[je]C[Now one can see that the marked stone is just defending 4  to 5 points of territory b
ut it have no strategic value. If White had played here first instead of the  marked stone he could now have attacked the whole Black group. A good way to  anlyze a position is to reverse the order of moves and often one finds that  the first move in a sequn
ce ends up in a useless position. It often pays to play the vital point  immediately.]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[jc];W[jd];B[kb];W[kc];B[ja];W[lb];B[jc];W[jh];B[jg];W[kg]
C[Horrible! If w
hite cut he must save his cutting stone. This is useless. The big white group  is alive as it stands and I cannot see any meaning at all of this move. It is  a move you play at christmas... a gift to your opponent.]
;B[ih];W[mh]C[The White group
 above has more than two eyes. Connecting it is inefficent. White should play  in the center instead. If Black then cuts White just play another move in the  center.]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[ej]C[A good move - it defend  Blacks own groups and prepa
re for an attack of the upper left White group later.];W[di];B[ei];W[eh]
;B[fh]C[This look clever but is  really a little reckless.];W[jj]L[gh]
C[A Black move at 'a' is sente (it  threaten a double atari) but if White play here now Black will have  difficulties to connect his ston
es.];B[eg]C[A clever move.];W[dg]C[Good move; this is normally the best way to defend in this  shape.]
;B[dh];W[ef];B[eh];W[bi]L[bj][ci]C['a' is  better shape because if Black play 'a' he threaten a snapback at b. This is a  very common shape and White  should try to always consider the move 'a' first. If it works it is better  than the hanging connection.]
;B[cj]C[Black doe not see that he can  threaten a snapback which is much better in terms of eyeshape and territory.  I guess both player have to s
tudy this shape and learn it.];W[jl];B[ij];W[ik];B[hj]C[
 baz 24k : is entering byo-yomi];W[nj];B[oj];W[mk]L[ol][nk]C[At 'a' or more safely at  'b' is better. Now black can gain a point or two with the atri at 'a'.]
;B[ci]L[lo]C[From now on I do not comment very much. The endgame is too long  and I think I have alrea
dy covered a lot in the fuseki and the middlegame.];W[ql];B[pl];W[ol];B

;B[hb];W[ha];B[ea]C[If  the White groups would h
ave survived it would have been an even and tough endgame.
I think that White has to improve his timing. He plays sente moves just  because they are sente not because they are good. And sometimes he leaves  important stones that must be defended from attack or capture. Patience is a  virtue even in Go.    Sometimes I have critisizes move in a harsch tone. It was not to offend the  players, but merely give a feeling for how bad the move is compared to other  better moves. Players at this level can improve fast if they just avoid those  "worst" moves, that ga
ins nothing.])
