Hi, I'm Andrew. I'll try to answer your questions in an easy-to-understand way if I can. Hopefully you will like lots of explanation, because I usually give answers in detail. If you have any questions about things I missed in the review, feel free to email me at ajnz1234@gmail.com.

;W[qi];B[qp]C[I'm sure I screwed up this joseki, but I'm not sure it was bad enough to explain the subsequent course of the game.



When white plays a stone on the 5-4 point, he is aiming to cause confusion. Invading is certainly an option, but if you want to avoid trouble you can leave it be until later to take large points on the rest of the board.

As for the joseki, you did make a mistake, but it was because white tried to trick you with a strange move.]

;W[fq]MA[lr][lq][mq][nq]C[Here's where I start feeling like my opponent's stones are better positioned than my own.


It is true that white has thickness, but the marked stones are still weak, so you are not in a bad position.]

(;B[ho]LB[io:A]C[Splitting is an excellent strategy here.

Knight's moves are always dangerous since they can be cut. Simply jumping out with 'A' would be sufficient, putting pressure on both the left group and the right group.]
;W[do]LB[dn:B][ho:A][io:C]C[My response to this turned out to be a huge disaster.  Is there a good way for black to play from here, or was it a mistake to play A instead of B in the first place?


I like 'A' and 'C' better than 'B'. 'B' would be too soft. The corner would still be vulnerable to a 3-3 invasion, so it wouldn't be that big.

33 is not all that severe, as long as you keep your shape solid.]

(;B[mo]LB[jo:A]C[I suppose this was also ill-advised, but I felt a need to make up for the loss in the lower left corner to have chance of retaking initiative in the game.  What should I have done instead?


Even though attacking is difficult, it must be done.

At this point in the game, you are down by a good 30 points or so. Unless you attack, the game is hopeless. Besides, this move has good potential. White's 4 stones have no base whatsoever, and you have a strong wall of stones to the left of it.

There have been better ways than 70, but any attack is better than no attack.]

;B[dj]LB[dh:A][el:B]C[Playing too close to thickness?


Yes. Considering "A" is a pincer, white splitting at "B" is extremely severe.]

C[At this point I'm feeling like maybe I have a shot of getting a fair amount of territory on the left and in the center.


White has upwards of 80 points, counting the right side and the corner. Black has 50 at the very most. Surely, you might win if you can seal that center, but it will be impossible since you would have to seal the gaps at "A", "B", "C", and "D" to consolidate it.]

I think the only two real mistakes you made were moves 30 and 38.  
 Move 30 (should be 37) was not a big mistake either. The game move 30 was certainly okay, but I think the complicated position that arose was to white's liking (since it was a handicap game).
 Move 38 was very understandable -- the corner was in danger -- but had it been a connection at 39, you would have been the one attacking white, and not the other way around. You would be able to keep the initiative and prevent the game from slipping into white's control.

I have the same problem in my handicap games. I am always afraid that white is going to kill my group, so I never counteratttack. But if you do counterattack, you can sometimes get white off-balance. You can keep him on the run so that he never gets the chance to attack you back (and you can fix your corner while you're at it!).


Do not worry about what happened in the end of the game. White was in the lead so you had no choice but to be aggressive. The attack happened to not work out, but as far as you knew it could have resulted in white's death, so it was the best strategy to try.


--

I hope this review was helpful for you. I mostly pointed out the mistakes (sorry if I have sounded too critical) but you should know that a whole lot more of your moves were great and very well played. I'm really glad that you are using GTL, because it is a terrific way to get stronger that not enough people know about. If only I had used it too... I tried to go the whole way solely on books! I can guarantee that you will get strong much quicker than the people around you will if you take advantage of the GTL and use it as often as you can.


Good luck!

Andrew
