AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, so I play as Numsgil (7k currently) on KGS.

You say you have trouble going over your own games.  Yes, it's hard, especially since right after a loss you're not in the mood to review.  But the best way to improve is to clearly identify one or two mistakes you made in each game you play.  Games you win should be even easier to review, even if you might not get as much from them.

Speaking of, when you submit games you should submit games you lost.  Games you won are less useful for the reviewer since, well, you won.

Generally, you have two areas of weakness: you like to run with weak stones, and you like to force opponents to connect when they're already diagonally connected.  You stop both bad habits now and you should be much stronger.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers!];W[pp]C[jahziah [13k\]: hi gg];B[dd];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd]

(;B[ph]C[This is the first somewhat questionable move.

First, you're probably better off either approaching white's corner or extending from one of your own.

Second, it's (probably) a bit too far from your top stones.  White can easily separate your stones _and_ at the same time extend towards the center _and_ cramp your stones in the corner.

See variations.];W[pf];B[qh];W[ri];B[pi];W[qk];B[of];W[rh];B[qn]
C[This isn't a reasonable move.  White responded well, and you're forced to run with a weak group.  Don't invade if you can get away with approaching from the other side (eg: O3).]
;W[qp]C[Good for white.];B[on];W[ok];B[ni];W[np]C[White has basically gained quite a bit of corner territory here, and you're two black stones are still in trouble!  That's the danger of weak stones: your opponent can chase them, and all the while he's building up strong walls to close off territory.]
(;B[kc]C[Too slow.];W[oe];B[pe];W[og];B[nf];W[pg];B[ng];W[oh]
(;B[oi]C[Be careful now.  You're not in a strong position on either side, and you're inviting a cut.  This is like catching a kinfe by the blade: possible, but frought with difficulty and danger.

Be sure to read out the variations.  If you can't read out life, err on the side of caution.  See variation]
;W[nh];B[mh];W[mi]
(;B[nj]C[It's possible to win this capture race, but not with this.  See variations.]
;W[li];B[lg];W[rg];B[mk]C[You're helping white build up stones with which to attack your two stones on the bottom there.

This is a good case of what's known as "squeezing out the toothpaste" or "family fued".  Your stones should work with each other, not against each other.

Here's a rule of thumb: if you have stones that are not securing territory, effectively cutting, or serving any other useful purpose, they are dead weight.  Any dead weight group under 7 stones is a good condidate to just be sacrificed.

In this case, I would leave these stones and concentrate somewhere else (say, the left side).  White gets 6 stones, but there are still a lot of liberties on your group so they still have some aji (potential) you might be able to use later.]

;W[ki];B[mn];W[lm];B[lo];W[lq]C[Oops, you're just basically forcing white to make territory.  And you have two weak groups here.  Abandon one and concentrate on the other.]
;B[jq]C[This is a bad shape, with white's stone there, because you just ask to be cut at L4.

There are circumstances where you can invite the cut and it's a good move because you can gain something out of it.  This is not such a case.]
;W[kp];B[jk];W[kg]C[White starts crimping your moyo on the top.  His group is still weak here in the center, but so is yours on the other side.]
;B[lf];W[ii];B[ko]C[Classic classic family fued/squeezing out the toothpaste.

Don't do this.  You just force white to make a move that hurts one of your stones.]

(;W[fm];B[gk]C[Notice how big your center group is, and then count how much territory it has.  It'd be lucky to form two eyes.

38 stones, and all you gain is maybe 2 points of territory.  That's a lousy ratio.

At this point it's too many stones to sacrifice, though, so you're stuck with defending.]
