C[majamin): This is a game I played on online-go.com (I am black). I'm hoping for comments regarding all aspects of my game.  I contacted my opponent (Alex666) and he agreed to comment on some moves as well (alternate moves are his suggestions).

-----------------------------------------------
hi majamin,
My name is Sven and I'm going to do the review for this game.

I hope I have mentioned all the main points :)
Every comment I've put in is marked with a *
Additionally all the main line comments are enumerated. There are 17 and all my variations are referenced there and also marked at the beginning with a *

Hopefully I could answer some of your questions and my comments are not too complicated
lg Sven];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]LB[qe:A][dj:E][qj:C][cn:D][qn:B]
(;B[qe]C[(Alex666): Such motion for professionals would be considered slow.

*
1. R15 is not slow! It's one of the common and best moves in this situation! It is a continuation of the very known shusaku fuseki. (see http://senseis.xmp.net/?ShusakuFuseki )
Since the third corner is blocked a shimari is the next step.

Now white normally plays around  E17, because a second shimari from black would be to good to allow.
(see variation)

All the other moves white has mentioned are also good moves, that can be played, but they are not better! It's just a question of playing style.]
(;W[kc]LB[ec:A][ic:B]C[*
2. So as I said, personally I would call this now the first mistake of the game. L17 gives you the chance to get a second shimari.
And you used it with the next move. I can't see any mistakes here from black!

The sequence, that white offers, can happen, but white can also react in a different way on J17, so I prefer blacks way in the original game. Getting the shimari and wait on whites move.]
(;B[ec];W[dj]LB[hc:B][jq:A]
(;B[jq]C[*
3. Also better than playing H17, because L17 allone its actually hard to find a good continuation for white. If white develops L17, this would be automatically a reason for black to develop one of its shimaris. Since white cannot develop L17 in a good way, black has time playing H17 later.]
;W[cg]LB[qj:A][gq:B]C[(Alex666): This W is smal.

*
4. yes it is :) The mentioned options (A and B) are better for white. For black both options are good. But B is too defensiv. See variation]
(;B[qj];W[fq]

5. Here also an attack with o3 would be better! (See variation on move 12)]

6. In my optinion P2 would be better as an attack in order to stabilise your own group and keeping sente. See variation on move 16]

(;B[dm]C[*
8. White's option and the variations are better because black cannot develop D7 on the 4. line. D10 and D4 do not allow that.
So it better to play C6, since this move has more options to develop it. D7 automatically has only one option: Run out.]
;W[co]LB[nj:A][in:B]
(;B[nj]C[(majamin): I don't think I should have ignored w50 by playing o10. My initial thought was that it would be easy for me to run out with my d7 stone ...

*
9. Yeah, already black should do something. Territory is balanced, but white has chance on a big moyo on the left. Q9 is not a problem, since the surrounding stones of black are all save. Better running directly with F7 to be save.]
;W[gk]LB[ej:A][ho:B]C[(majamin): ... so when white played this move I realized I would have to start a complicated fight to save d7. I think my next move was too hectic (Alex666 agreed as you can see with the next comment)]
(;B[ej]C[(Alex666): this is big error.

*
10. So you are under attack and the first and defensive move should be  getting straight out. Since white made a big jump you should also make a big jump, but straight! G7 should be your choice here, but its a favorable fight for white ( see my variation on move 52 ).
So here we first have to attack whites connection and your idea was right, but hitting a white stone is not a good way to attack the link between a large knights move. E9 and F10 are preferable. (See other variation)]
;W[dk];B[fm]C[(majamin): I think I should have pushed at e9 to build a wall instead.

*
right];W[hm];B[jm]C[(majamin): I'm trying to save influence here, but next white plays the move I should have played before (at e9).

*
11. yeah K7 seems to give up all the stones on the left. E9 would be better.]

[is]C[(majamin): This move sealed my stones in and I realized how wasteful the marked stones had become.

(Alex666): This position is not good for B. W is close territor equal territory B. But B have some aji (A, B, C).

*
12. Compare this situation with move 51 variation];B[ne];W[jk]
LB[md:B][bp:A]
(;B[bp]C[(majamin): my attempt at regaining some of what I lost by threatening to connect underneath. My corner stones did not end up living ... I'm not sure if life was possible here.

*
13. No there's no good way to deal inside white influence sphere.
Black can try to attack C13 in order to create influence and attacking afterwards L17. Or getting some points on the left.

*
15. Well you discussed the situation very deeply with your opponent and the situation is very complicated and you have to decide what stones of white are allowed to be connected and what not. Its blacks choice and I'm sure there are some options how to play. I added a variation that should kill the white stones on the right and also weaken the upper stones with O17]

16. In my opinion it is good. But black should be aware that it is overstrechted and therefore has to step back if white attacks the links between blacks stones.

The variations of white here are not preferable. H12 tastes better
