C[Hi,

my name is hubert, and i played black. In the game, i was able to build enough strengh to surround the circle, but then i failed to kill white dragon in the end, and i lost.

i hope u could answer my questions, and also points out when i should defend my territory in the center rather than expand it bigger, and more unsecure.

thank you!

Hubert,
Thanks for the game.

B develops a very thick position with a huge central influence.
W co-operates with B's strategy by taking the corners and some side, and ignoring central influence.
W invades far too late and should die.....but doesn't.

Stronger opponents would be far more effective/aggressive in invading/reducing the central influence of B.

Nonetheless this style of play is very good to practice and to find flexible ways of exploiting your thickness.

;B[dc]C[i was thinking of playing E14 instead of D17, is it possible?

G:
Yes.
Its uncommon but works well with your c9 stone building outside influence.
W gets a big corner.];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb];B[de]C[Should i play F14 instead?

i felt this move helps white to secure his corner, but didnt' give blak any strenght]
;W[ce];B[ic]LB[ee:a][jd:b][kd:c][pj:d]C[i am not sure if white would reply if i had played E16,

if i played E16, will it be too slow? or is it urgent move?

a is best locally. Slow but solid.
b,c are bout right distance extension.
d is a big point];W[nc]MA[ic]TR[jd][kd]C[is white better if he had played somewhere near Q14 instead?

This is a good move for W, B looks overconcentrated 
B finds it difficult to  attack severely...
but if j17 at l16 ..p17 make life difficult for B.];B[oe]LB[oc:a]

(;B[rc]C[could R16 kill this group? or should i play O13 to enclose it in the corner?

No. B can chop off r13 stones but cant kill entire grp (easily :))]

W must invade B central moyo
a-e are good starting points

If W substntially limits B central territory W should win (by a slim margin )with the corner territory.]
;B[fp]LB[hp:a][ip:b]C[i am not really sure what this moves does? (i copy this move from a game i watched before)
could u explain?

This isn't a very good move for B it doesnt threaten the W grooup nor does it decisively strengthen the moyo.
W can still play a-e from the last diagram and now her bottom grp is alive

a or b is good move for B here, if W defends, B has another move to expand the moyo.]
;W[er]LB[ng:a][ni:b][li:c][jj:d][jm:e][jl:f][jn:g][ki:h]C[W *must* invade the moyo

Any of these moves are ok];B[gp];W[hq];B[ip]C[again, i copy this move from that game i watched.

is it correct in this situation?

This is correct
W has allowed B to develop a massive moyo. J4 = airport!];W[kr]

ie she should die!];W[dl]C[u could end ur review here, i didnt play the last couple move carefully, and failed to kill the dragon.

thank you again for the review.
