C[I played this game as my 2nd game over the internet the first being against my best friend Mahogny, though at that time I were still trying out how to count points and what the goals of go was.

Since then there had been a long time nearly 4 month since I played him and between that I had been reading and playing against AIGO 1.2 on the palm which I were starting to win against...

I challenged JJJ1 (10 kyu) because I wanted to know how good a 10 kyu guy really is and also to know how good I am,

Just before this game I had watched 15 episodes of fansubbed "Hikaru no go" and I was really eager to play Go, so at 24:30 I logged into IGS and challenged a japanese who's nick was JJJ1.

It was important that I challenged a japanese because I'm addicted to much anything about Japan.

Hi, I hope this review is helpful to you. --regyt];B[dp]LB[cp:A]
[dq:B]C[Though you say you didn't understand the importance of corners yet, this first move is perfectly appropriate. Sai and Hikaru often start on the third line, right under the star (at A or B) - this is called komoku.  --regyt]
;W[pd];B[pf]C[It's more common to take the corners first, with each player having two corners at the end of the first four moves. However, while unusual, attacking like this can turn into a very good play, if you know how to capitalize on it.  --regyt]
;W[pp];B[nd]C[I should probably have taken the 4th corner instead, but as this game is played at 5 may 2002 I didn't know the advantage of corners, I read about fusekis on 7 may :)

***

I agree, taking the fourth corner would have been a better move at this point.  --regyt]
;W[cc];B[dd]LB[cj:A][jq:B]C[At this point, the game still looks relatively even to me. Black is playing for influence more than territory, and there's a lot that can be done with that. The next thing Black wants to do is extend along the sides, to somewhere around A or B.  --regyt]
;W[dc]
(;B[ec]LB[cd:A]C[This is unsafe, and you see why with White's next move. A would have been better - Black would be blocking White into the corner, forcing White to react, and building a wall of influence towards the left-hand side, with that one move.  --regyt]
;W[ed];B[fd]C[This is not necessarily bad, but in general it's often better to extend after a cut than to atari. Putting White's stone into atari like this pushes him towards the left side, which is where Black wants to be. Why force him into gaining influence there instead of just gaining influence there yourself?  --regyt]
;W[ee];B[oj]LB[pj:B][qj:A]C[Extending here is a good idea, but that's too high up to be safe. To secure that side, playing at A or even B would have been better. I understand the desire to stake out a huge chunk, but if Black can live on the third line safely it's worth more than a riskier attempt on the fifth line.  --regyt]
;W[oe]LB[jc:C][ck:A][qn:D][jq:B][nq:E]C[Black's next move was not the largest move possible on the board. A through E are some examples of larger moves Black could have played next. Black ended up playing at the marked point.  --regyt]

(;B[ng]C[I don't really know why I'm doing this, even as it was only a couple of days I played this game,
I think I'm trying to make white back of from (my) corner

***

I think I see what you're trying to do here, but I don't see how it's worth it right now. Look at the board. Right now you're still in fuseki (opening game), and the most important thing to do is to spread your influence and take the largest points on the board. The stone you placed is not worth very much. Check the variations I put after White move 14 to see some larger points you could have taken instead.  --regyt]
;W[ne];B[me]LB[md:A]C[It would have been safer for Black to extend to A instead. This leaves a dangerous cutting point.   --regyt]
;W[md];B[mc]C[Again, when you atari, try to pay attention to which way you're pushing your opponent. Push him in the direction you want him to go.  --regyt]
;W[ld];B[kd]LB[nc:A]C[I had been testing on paper against myself how to trap someone again who is trying to get away from a single atari, so that what I'm exercise with this stone.

***

Because of the weak point at A, this is futile.  --regyt];W[le]
;B[mf];W[nc]C[Now I saw that my black stone was in Atari thought i was to late to save him now.]
;B[oc]C[I try in vain to do something to stop JJJ1 to not capture my stone.]

;B[lf];W[de];B[ke];W[nd];B[he];W[kf]C[At this time I didn't know what a cut was either but I do now, and I could probably had placed my last stone on K14 instead to prevent it, thought I do't know why I would like to prevent it.

Beside connecting my own stones.

***

Actually, this cut isn't very important. It separates two groups, sure, but each of them has room to live, so you don't need them to be connected.  --regyt]
;B[mg]LB[kc:C][nf:B][mg:A]C[This stone is wasted. The diagonal connection is rock-solid (if White cuts at A, Black connects at B, and vice-versa). Black should have protected the cut at C instead.  --regyt]
;W[kc];B[jd]TR[jd][kd][ke]C[With this stone Black has created an empty triangle (made up of the marked stones). The empty triangle is the classic example of a bad shape. The next few moves show you one reason why it's a shape to avoid making.  --regyt]
;W[jc];B[ic]LB[id:A]C[A would have been better here. Several times already you've been to eager to hane - it is often safer to extend.  --regyt]
;W[id];B[jf]C[again my inability to see when I'm going to get into an Atari, this time he got my wall that I tried to keep alive.

It gets easier to see these things over time. :)   --regyt]
;W[je];B[hc];W[fq];B[fp]LB[cn:A][dq:B][eq:C]C[More standard responses for Black would have been at A, B, or C.   --regyt]
;W[gp];B[ep];W[eq];B[go];W[dq];B[cq]C[Here I tried to get the corner and the left border as my territory by blocking my opponent's path with a wall.

***

This isn't a bad thought. Black has been playing for influence throughout this game. But now is the time to start making that influence work. The next thing that should be done is to extend from this wall and make use of it in capturing a big chunk of territory along the left side.  --regyt]
;W[cr];B[br]LB[bq:A]TR[br]C[This has a cut at A. It would have been better to just play at A instead of the marked stone. This is an unsafe pattern with that cut, and comes up often.   --regyt]
;W[bq];B[cp];W[bs]C[Though it seems like he forced throught it.]
;B[ar]TR[br]C[This move is unecessary. Black's marked stone was already lost.  --regyt]
;W[aq]C[I should have seen this coming and let the Atari stone died, by adding an extra stone I just gave more points to him, didn't I?

***

Yup.  --regyt];B[fo]LB[ci:A][cj:B][dk:C]C[Black's play at the marked stone is understandable but not very important at this point. Black should have extended to A, B, or C instead.  --regyt]
;W[dk]C[I were really hoping he weren't going to put a stone somewhere there, thought I knew it would be coming!

***

It's great that you knew it would be coming. But here's a good thing to learn - your opponent's best move is often your best move. If you see where he's going to play, the easiest way to keep him from doing so is to just play there yourself.  --regyt]

(;B[oo]LB[cl:B][qn:A]TR[dk]C[I try to make his attention somewhere else by attacking his corner.

***

First, if Black wanted to attack White's corner, it would have been better to approach from A instead of the marked stone.   Also, Black doesn't need to try to distract White. Black can still extend to B safely and make some territory while threatening White's marked stone.

This is actually a very key point in the game, in my eyes.  --regyt]
;W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[ql];W[pn];B[on]C[but instead he only took more territory from the border and I don't know how to counter that so I built a wall to prevent him taking even more of the border.

How would I have been able to prevent this from happening?

***

By attacking differently from the start. Try to attack lower, on the third line, and in a way such that it extends your territory while you attack. Each stone should have more than one purpose. Make your stones work hard for their money. ;)   --regyt]
;W[om];B[nm]C[This is also one of my inabilities, I were so much focused on one spot I didn't notice what happened around it and I thought that his stone would die if he didn't flee,

Thought I was so focused on that spot I didn't notice I was in Atari Myself, this could have been avoided by an easy connection.]
;W[pl]LB[qk:A][cl:D][kq:C][nq:B]C[A through D are stronger moves that Black could make at this point. Black ended up playing at the marked point.  --regyt]

(;B[nn];W[op];B[ol];W[pm];B[ok]LB[pk:A][cl:E][jp:B][np:D][lq:C]
TR[om]C[As he took even my points by destroying my wall I had no choise to build a wall further into the middle.

Perhaps that wasn't the best to do?
What should I have been doing?

***

Your wall wasn't destroyed, really. It was built up through this exchange. What do you think is being destroyed?

Oh, and you always have the choice - it's a big board, and you can play almost anywhere you want to. :)   Playing at A would have kept Black's control of the right side a bit more than the marked stone did. Another thing Black could have done would be to not put the triangled stone into atari, but extended down and left instead, perhaps to B, C, or D. Or just ignore all that for now and play over near E!  --regyt]
;W[pk]
(;B[nl]C[This stone was unecessary, because the ladder works if White cuts at that point.   --regyt]
;W[mq];B[el]C[now when I secured that he wouldn't get further into the middle I were preapering an attack on the stone!

***

Black has the right idea in attacking that stone and in extending from your wall. However, it would work better to attack from below. It's important to get as much territory as possible along the sides.  --regyt]
;W[dl];B[em]C[thought It didn't work out

SHould I have placed my stones behind his stone instead?

***

I'm not sure what you mean by behind. If you mean below (closer to the left side), yes.   --regyt]
;W[ek];B[fk]LB[dh:C][cm:B][dm:A]C[Playing at A, B, or C would have been better for Black. A makes territory, B grabs more of the side, and C is a more agressive invasion.  --regyt]
;W[dh];B[ei];W[di];B[ej];W[eh];B[fh];W[dm]C[Now the shape of a wall guarding the middle is beginning to take shape.

This seems to be my main problem, I get pushed into the center all the time!

Is there anything I could have done to prevent this?

***

You could have been more aggressive earlier and tried to stake out the sides. There were numerous points where you had a choice between side territory and center influence, and chose the influence.   --regyt]
;B[en]C[All this is fine when playing for influence. However, you should understand that most of the territory is along the sides. If White gets the sides and Black gets the entire center, White will win. So building this (strong) wall is only giving White the territory he wants.]
;W[dj];B[fn]TR[en][fo][ep]C[He started to get a lot of territory at the borders while squeezing myself into the center, I didn't really fight for the border but just tried to get as much space in the center as possible. Though I hoped that in the end of the game I could earn some extra territory by stealing his stones on the border.

***

This move was unecessary. The tiger's mouth (the triangle stones) is very solid. Black's move was wasted.  --regyt]
;W[fg];B[gf]LB[fi:A]C[Careful of the cutting point at A. It would have been better to extend to the marked spot.  --regyt]

C[Now he is pushing me further into the center and I can't do anything.

***

You don't always have to react to his moves. At this point, it would still be possible for Black to get territory on the right side or invade on the bottom.  --regyt]
;W[gq];B[cm]LB[cn:A]C[This is unsafe. What if White plays at A?  --regyt]

(;W[cl];B[bl]LB[cn:A]C[Extending to A would have worked better here.  --regyt]

I'm not sure what you let go, you protected the middle pretty well.  --regyt]

A good thought, but to be honest, I can't see how that would be possible. White is very strongly connected to a living group. Trying to invade at A *might* have worked out for Black, though.  --regyt]

It's good that you understand about eyes. However, much like with many other things in Go, once you have the space to make eyes, you don't have to actually make them. The reason being - you CAN make them if you need them, and by making them now, you're only filling in your own territory and lowering your total score at the end.  --regyt]

He obviously won, but I thought It was a good game!

I'm still in the progress of learning to play go, perhaps you could show me how I should have done on a lot of situations, and what I did wrong?

The game lasted about 45 minutes and I lost, but not by so much as Mahogny thought I would. When I told him, that I played against a 10 kyu over IGS last night!

This was a good game. You did well, especially since it was your second game. Overall, however, there are some things you could work on. You need to understand the worth of the sides as opposed to the center, and to see what it's like to play for territory. You could also do well to be more aggressive, and remember the proverb - you can always tenuki (play elsewhere). You do not have to continually react to your opponent. You'll have a lot more fun if you try to lead him around the board. ;)   One aspect of this is that at any given moment, you should play the biggest point on the board. This is particularly important in fuseki (opening game). This won't always have anything to do with what your opponent has done or the fight that's been going on, and you'll get a better sense of it as you go along.   Also, not every cutting point has to be so vigorously protected. Some are safe as is, and you can play more efficiently elsewhere. You'll also get a better sense of which cutting points need protecting and which don't as you play more games. You saw already that White had many holes in his walls that you couldn't break through - you should be able to manage that, too.

You mentioned you've been playing against AIGO. You should be wary that it, like every other Go program, stinks compared to real people. (to prove the point - Janice Kim once gave the Go program Handtalk a 25 stone handicap, and won!) If you have the time, you'll learn much more by playing in Go clubs or on IGS, KGS, Yahoo Games, or one of the other servers out there.   I hope this helps, and happy playing. I'm sure I'll bump into you on IGS someday. :)
