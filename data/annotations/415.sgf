WR[30k]HA[0]KM[0.5];B[dp]C[My 3rd review for dsmith.  Standard disclaimers apply...

Black- dsmith 20k
White- climber 30k

Game from IGS I believe.  June 1997
Result:  The game is incomplete.  I assume it was decided by resignation.   I assume black won.

Niether player yet owns a *rating, so again, I will assume new players,  and try to be verbose in commentary.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dd];B[jp];W[je]C[This  move by white is strange IMHO.

Strategically:  White generally cannot afford to play at the top, as this  just continues to afford black the comfort of the first move advantage.   Unless white is particularly good at 'mimic' go, mirroring black's moves  until he can pounce in with a lead-taking move, white should probably  avoid this kind of strategy, particularly at the 30k-15k level.
   White probably should consider mixing things up a bit, and begin to  attack/approach black around r6 or c6.

Tactically:  Locally white would do better to play at k16.  While black  could invade under white in either case, having the stone at k15 instead  of k16 gives black quite a bit more freedom to undercut in the  center-top.  Also, k16 would 'assist' the stones at d&q16 better than  k15, should black begin a fight in the corners.

After this, as black I would consider playing K17 right away, trying to  split white's two corners apart, which might give black a position to use  his strong bottom side to fight for the left and right sides at an  advantage over white.
   Also, black at  D14 now seems good, since the standard white replies  (F16, F17, G17) do not work well with K15 and leave room for invasion  at the top.]
;B[qc]C[This is too early for this invasion.  There is a  thread on rec.games.go UseNet group now about this topic - please check  it out.

To summarize:  White should get a wall facing outward, and black will  likely get a corner worth about 10 points.  White's wall will be worth  more than 10 points this early in game.  If white builds that wall in the  direction of K15, then K15 may turn out to be a good move, since that  wall will make it more difficult for black to undercut the top around  k17.  For black to help white this way is bad.

I would prefer black at R14 first, as explained in the last  move.];W[qd]
C[I think white plays in the wrong diection here.

Black will be happy for white to have a wall facing downward, especially  if black gets sente (the first move elsewhere) after this corner  exchange.  Black will use that sente move to play around q10 and make  white's wall less valuable.  Black gets sente with the standard joseki  next: black q17, white  p17, p18, o17, o18, n17, s16, s15, s17, r14.   Then black q10 is great.

White can still take sente by modifying the 'standard' joseki as follows:  black q17, white p17, p18, o18, o17, p16, n18, o16, n17.  Then white  plays q10 which is ok.  But, black gets a fairly strong group that  already is undercutting the top side.  So this is good for black too I  think.

So black should Q17 now.];B[rc]C[Hmm.
This is a bad move - here's why...

White should praise his luck, and play Q17 now.  That would begin to make  K15 and the top side look much better.  Also, black will be forced to  play again in the corner to live, and so white should get sente here.

The result here should leave white with a strong useful wall, and black  with a small life (smaller than he should have gotten which means that  he has just given away free points to white!).  For shame!]
;W[rd]C[White is still trying to point his wall in the wrong direction,  and also to give black more territory than he deserves.

S16 should be at Q17.];B[ob]C[This move should be at Q17 I believe.  The  difference between these two is fairly small (for play at this kyu  level), and so I am not sure I am right, but here's what I think:

P18 is the move black generally plays to secure quick life here when  there are more white stones around o17.  In this case, without a white  stone there, black can get more territory with q17, white p17, p18, o17,  o18, n17, black elsewhere.

Either way, I still think black ends up well here, since white will be  undercut at the top, and K15 will be poorly placed for white.  Black  should also get to play at Q10 first which is good for black.]
;W[oc]C[I  think Q17 is better for white here];B[pc]C[Black reverts back to  'standard' joseki form (except black does not have s16 because of  black's bad move at s17 before.), assuming white continues next at  o17.]
;W[od]C[This move is not part of the basic 3-3 invasion joseki  because it allows black to play o18 which is a huge reduction of the top,  and also strengthens black's corner, which currently has some invasion  potential for white to exploit (at least as ko threat if not true  killing potential.)

If black next at o18, then white can get q10, but I believe black can  allow this, since white's loss at the top should exceed his gain on the  right side.]
;B[pj]C[A big move, but I think black will be in danger in  the corner if white plays at o18.

I've included variations to test this, if black answers o18 at q19.  If  your SGF software can show variations, try clicking on o18 variations  now.]

(;W[dj]C[White gives black upper right a break.

I think this is a case of urgent moves being more important than big  moves.   Of course it is hard to see the value of a stone at o18.   However, if you study this corner position, I think you will see that  white at o18 presents a serious threat to black's corner.  Conversely,  black at o18 presents a serious reduction to white's top.  Therefore,  this move is rather big.

Black should play o18 now I think.];B[cp]C[This is certainly a big move.   Black is deciding to claim a big corner here.  But there are other big  moves that are more urgent.

Generally speaking, starting a game with a sanren-sei formation gives  black the strength and speed to attack white all over the board.  It is  high-level thinking to play this way (higher than me), but well  documented in Go books.

Simply put, if white attacks black's bottom left it would probabably be  at c6, but the likely outcomes of this attack are such that black should  probably get a wall facing righward towards his other stones - forming a  large moyo which will be harder to invade and hopefully turn into a big  territory.

I would prefer black to play at o18 now.];W[gg]C[Wow.  This is  interesting, and not unlike dsmith's play in the first game I reviewed  for him.  This move was probably meant to surround a giant part of the  board.

However, his move does not make the top or top left corner any more  secure.  This move does not really make the stone at d10 significantly  stronger.  If you follow the 'corners first, then sides, then middle'  proverb, it should be clear that white has no corners yet, and that the  top and left sides are not yet secure.  So going so far towards the  middle is not warranted here I think.

White could strengthen his top and left just as much by attacking black  around r6 ;)]
;B[cc]C[At first I didn't like this move, but I have  changed my mind somewhat.

Since G13 is fairly close to D16, the results of this C17 invasion should  benefit black I think.

Who comes out of this fight with sente is key, since o18 is still open.   Also key is the direction that white picks to block black's stones and  form a wall.

White chose C16.
I would choose D17 (see variation)]
(;W[cd]C[Given the possibility of black o18, this move is ok.  However, I  would prefer to play at d17, and try for sente to play white at o18 first.

See the variation I mentioned in the last move for  d17.];B[dc];W[ec];B
[eb];W[fb]C[Interesting.  This is the same sente  taking move that I discussed in the variation for this corner.  If black  follows joseki now and plays at f17, then white will be undercut at the  top yet again.

The result is that white's top is essentially worth zero - which is good  for black.  White would be strong, but over concentrated at the left  side.  Black already has the q10 point on the right so I think black  would be ahead.]
;B[db]C[Woops :)

 With d18, black has already given away too much.  This is similar to the  s17 move earlier that leaves black with a potential mess in the upper  right.

Study the 3-3 invasion joseki when looking back over this game.  I think  you will learn why the joseki moves are played.  Black's results in these  corners would improve quite a bit.]
;W[bc];B[bb];W[ab];B[bd];W[ad];B[ac];W[be]C[black should just connect at b17 now.  This would  leave white with cutting points at c15, e16, and f17.  White could not  cover them all, and black is alive here after the connection  anyway.]
;B[aa];W[bc];B[fc]C[Finally :)

Notice however, that white's cutting points at c15 do not exist right now  - so black would need to 'waste' a move to get the threat back.  Black  lost a bit here.]
;W[ed];B[gb];W[ab]C[This is small and white should  definitely play elsewhere.

Black has life on the top side anytime with the capture at f19.  So black  should rejoice that white is taking only a point or two here and allowing  black to play anywhere on the board black chooses.

I would choose o18, d8, or q3, or r3.];B[ba]C[Petty and nearly worthless]
;W[fd]C[A good move for white locally.  Since the top is worth little,  this forcing move helps white on the left.]
;B[fa]C[I think g17 woud have  been better for black];W[gc]C[probably worth pursuing for white since  black f19...]
;B[ac]C[Bad - fighting over 1 point now.  Who cares?  This  is endgame material.  Better to play at h18]
;W[fb];B[bd];W[ae]C[if white  must play here, play c15 instead.];B[fc];W
[bc];B[hc];W[fb];B[bd];W[hd];B[ib];W[bc];B[fc];W[gd];B[fb];W[ab];B[jd]C
[This is not  big.  Let white try to play here first.  What will he get?  There is just  not much at the top for either player - except perhaps the threat of o18  against black's corner.

So play o18, or play elsewhere.  A black play in the bottom right would  be huge now.

Note that for the next 20 moves or so, black tries very hard to win a  small territory at the top.  It would have been much more fruitful for  black to leave this place, and play around d8, or r7, or r12.

Also note:  White's stone at G13 - wouldn't it be much better for white  if it were at c6 or c7?]
;W[id];B[lc];W[kd];B[jc];W[ic];B[hb];W[kc];B[jb];W[ld];B[lb];W[mc];B[mb]
;W[nb];B[na];W[nc]C[So the fight at the top is 'over.'  Black  has played 32 stones at the top and gained 19 points.

Black could have let white capture the top, and with some basic  resitance, white would have gotten a very small territory at the top.

The conclusion is that black should NOT have been fighting so hard for so  little.]
;B[dl]C[Good move locally.  It is the perfect distance from a  2-stone wall like D4.  It begins to keep white overconcentrated on the  left.]
;W[dk]C[Interesting attack.  Black could respond at e8 I think,  starting a big moyo at the bottom.]
;B[jj]C[dsmith likes this k10!

I think this is ok, but there are better moves around.    I prefer black e8, c8, r12 (aims at s15), f8, ...]
;W[ij];B[ac]C[What?

This is absolutely pointless.  White should rejoice and play e8, r6, r3?,  f8?...]
;W[oa]C[White wastes a ko threat.  Useless.];B[pa];W[ab]C[Obviously by  now, I think this is terrible.]
;B[ik]C[Black is lucky to get here  first.];W[hj];B[hk];W[gj]C[Ok, now be careful not to get into a contact  fight, where every move touches your opponent.

Black now at k11 is very big.  Or play at c8 or o10?];B[fk];W[fj];B[ek]
;W[ej];B[li]C[Not bad, but if you want to reduce white, I think k11 is  perhaps better - cuts more directly into his moyo.

Also, black at c8 is big now, if nothing else but to make black stronger  here.  Of course, it does threaten to undercut white  also...]
;W[ji];B[kj];W[lh];B[ni];W[nh];B[ph]C[good];W[oh];B[oi];W[pg];B[qh];W[qg]
;B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[ki];B[lj];W[mi];B[mj];W[mh]C[Black now is super-strong on the right side.  There are just no  weaknesses in this wall.  Therefore, if black were to play at r3 now,  white would have difficulty catching up.]
;B[qp]C[Good!];W[ac]C[What?

I am astounded at the perceived value of the a17 point in this game.   Black should be dancing at his terminal, and playing a stone around c8 I  think.]
;B[kb]C[I don't think black is threatened severely by white l18,  so this is not important.

It is equally bad to white's last move.  A 1 point endgame move played  too early.  This should be the second to last move in the game, just  before someone plays at a17!]
;W[sc];B[bk]C[Now black has the idea.

Black should be wary of T17 though.  This move has the potential to take  more than 1 point away.  But certainly black at B9 is bigger.   Kudos.]
;W[bj];B[ck];W[cj];B[gk];W[ak];B[al];W[aj];B[bm];W[sg]C[Ok, now black is solid everywhere, except  that white might make an invasion at the bottom.  If black plays  at/around k3, then black should be able to kill any invader.

Notice that all the bottom black stones are on the 4th line.  White might  try an undercut around n3?

In any case, black should ignore white t13, since black can defend  against t12 also.  Black at s18 or k3 would be  best.]
;B[sh];W[sf];B[mn]C[I don't see the value here.

If worried about an invasion, the invader geneally needs to use the side  or the corner to help his stones live.  Starting an invasion in an area  completely surrounded by enemy stones is a sure way to suicide.  Black  should defend at the side, like n3 or k3.]
;W[jq];B[ip];W[kq];B[lp]C[since white has nowhere to run to in the middle, black  should try to sweep his legs out from under white.  Play at n2 since this  stone can back up and be reinforced by q4.  This would make it hard for  white to make eyes at the  edge.]
;W[lq];B[mq];W[mr];B[nq];W[nr];B[or];W[os];B[ps];W[ns];B[lr];W[kp];B[ko]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[mp];B[no]C[good that black 'backed  off' here.];W[iq];B[hp]
;W[hq];B[gp];W[gq];B[fq]
(;W[fr]C[I am not sure what happened here.  If the email transmission was  ok, then I assume somebody resigned.  I hope it was not black!

By my counting, black is ahead by something like 50 points, even if white  manages to live at the bottom.  Since black captured the four stones at  n2, it will be hard for white to make eyes at the bottom.

I've encluded a variation here for finishing the game.  Black appears to  win by 60 points in my variation.  Even if I got the endgame order wrong,  I doubt that white can catch up.

All in all, this game represents an improvement for black over previuos  games I think.  Black did leave local fighting a few times to take big  points (such as c4 and r4) and even if the timing was not always right,  this is good playing.

 Black probobly spent too much effort fighting at the top, and should  have left the battle to play big points elsewhere.

  Black was never in too much danger in this game.  White waited far too  long to try to invade at the bottom.  White played his upper corner  variations in the wrong directions I think, which made his results bad  even when white seemed to win locally.

Black made a few tactical errors in the upper corners at s17 and d18, but  did not lose too much because of them.  I would practice these corner  josekis with the help of a book (such as 38 Basic Joseki from  Ishi/Kiseido).  I think that the book, "Opening Theory Made Easy" by  Otake Hideo would be a great study guide also.

Good luck.])
