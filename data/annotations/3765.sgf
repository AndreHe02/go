C[*X*: Hi, Nadja.  I'm Alex Weldon, a 2d from Canada.  I'm putting *X*: before my comments (X for Xopods, my KGS username) to distinguish them from yours.  I hope this review is helpful, although you already correctly identified most of your big mistakes.  Your strategy is pretty good, but you got careless a lot.

Hi there!

This is a game I recently played in a tournament. Due to my bad counting skill, I was quite surprised to have lost by a margin as large as 17 points, in fact both of us, my opponent and me, felt that black was ahead quite a lot of the game.

I took the black stones in this game, trying out my latest toy: a fuseki consisting of two 6-3 points. :)

Well, I believe that the endgame is the weakest part of my game, at least it's where the most obvious mistakes occur. One of those yose blunders may be the reason for me losing this game.

All in all, I enjoyed playing this game a lot - though I didn't read ahead too much, more likely playing the "good-looking", "shape" moves, more guided by intuition than by thorough analysis (usually a thing to avoid in a tournament game...). :)

Hope you have fun reviewing our game, too!

Best wishes,

fey
(Nadja Sommerfeld)];B[qf]C[*X*: I don't know much at all about the 6-3 point, except that I imagine that Q17 would probably be the most common approach, which would turn into a low distant approach to komoku, followed by tenuki.]
;W[dp];B[nq]C[*X*: I'm not sure, but I think this is right (assuming you're going to play a second 6-3), instead of F17.  Just a hunch though... it's hard to say why, except that if F17, W can choose a move in the lower right that minimises the value of R14.]
;W[dd];B[jc]C[*X*: I'm confusing your opponent (and the reviewer) is your goal, I think you're succeeding admirably. :-)  I think as W, I wouldn't try to figure out what to do on your side of the board yet, and just play san-ren-sei.

---

Here we go!
I recently found an article about this opening on gobase.org, and, applying it in my games, it worked out quite well, so I play it from time to time.]
;W[no]TR[qo][pp][qp][pq][qq]C[*X*: Non-standard is putting it mildly.  Any of the triangled points look like reasonable approaches to me.  I think in response to O5, B can just play Q4 and make O5 look weird.

Surely a non-standard approach move. In the post-game discussion, he told me he was thinking of a high kakari on a komoku when playing this.
I still wonder what he had in mind... :)];B[qq]C[*X*: I think R4 looks bad.  The thing to think about here is tewari.  Say you had an R4/O3 enclosure.  Then O5 looks like a reasonable way to reduce it.  Not at this stage of the game, mind you, but at some point.  Furthermore, if you had an R4/O3 enclosure, and W played at O5, you probably wouldn't tenuki.

R3 looks good to me, though it's low.  I still like Q4 the best.  Then, applying tewari, it looks as if you had a hoshi stone, and W approached at O5 (which is ridiculous) and you played O3 (which seems like the most reasonable way to punish O5).

----

R4 looks more energetic, but I like the san-san shimari better because there's less aji.]
;W[mq];B[nr]C[*X*: You're right, he's wrong.  O4 is the worst move in this shape.  This seems fine to me, though again, you're very low.  Still, you're getting sente and leaving him with an open skirt, so you're fine.

He proposed O4 here, which I didn't like because it strenghtens his position more and does, in my opinion, not help the corner much.
It's bad shape, too... "hane at the head of two stones"];W[mp]
;B[pn]C[*X*: This move feels slack to me.  Your corner is already alive, so adding moves is just points... well, not just points, because Q6 has influence up the right, but still, taking sente is much more important.

Furthermore, this move is thin.  It leaves a lot of aji in the corner for W to exploit, starting with R4.  See variation for one example.

---

Certainly a funny looking joseki wannabe result :)
I felt pleased with my nice big corner, seems to me I got out of this exchange quite ahead.]

(;W[pd];B[of]C[*X*: With K17 in place, this isn't bad... W can't extend on the fourth line, because he'll leave himself an open skirt.  Instead, he has to submit with O17, so you get sente and influence.

However, a double kakari at O17 or O16 is also good.

---

Double-kakari on O17 is more usual, but some time ago I "invented" this P14, which not only combines with my formation in the lower right but also leaves me with possibilities in the corner.]
;W[nd]C[*X*: Well, this is the move that I just said he *can't* play, and here he is playing it.  You can aim at O18 later.]
;B[dj]C[*X*: I don't think tenuki is too bad.  He has two weakish groups around here (top right and N4), so creating a third would be a bad idea for him.  However, if you're going to wedge on the left side, the low wedge is usually better, because it settles quickly. (C10, making miai of C13 and C7).  You could also play an asymmetric wedge at C11 or C9, but it's beyond my comprehension to say which is best.

----

Tenuki seems risky here. I admit I feared him invading around Q10, crushing all my moyo dreams. :)
I decided to tenuki at last because P14/R14 were still able to seek life in the corner and my lower right was solid enough.
The prospect of him  playing D10 himself scared my more in the end. ;)]
;W[dl];B[cf];W[fd]C[*X*: Here he is again, extending on the fourth line when you have K17 there.  Tsk, tsk.]
;B[me]C[*X*: This just helps him.];W[md];B[le];W[lc];B[pj]C[*X*: You're too single-minded.  N15 and M15 were bad, since you let him fix his open skirt and apply pressure to K17.  Furthermore, if he plays F3 now, his moyo is looking as big as yours.

I began to have a good feeling about the game now, having finally got to play Q10. :)]
;W[fl]C[*X*: He has the right idea, but F3 is a better moyo-building move than F8.

----

I wondered quite some time about this. Some moves later, I figured it to be a ladder breaker for N14 cut, but my opponent told me after the game that F8 served only a moyo-building purpose.
I became nervous about my left-side group anyway.];B[bd]C[*X*: This slide is bad.  First of all, it actually weakens, rather than strengthens your group, unless you're planning to defend at E14 after W C17.  This is because, if you haven't played the slide yet, you can always play C17 and sacrifice C14 if he invades at C12.  Then you only have to worry about D10.  If you slide here and lose the corner invasion, then C12 becomes very severe.

Sliding in this particular position is also bad for a second reason; that is, once he's played C17, F18 no longer sweeps his base out as effectively as it did before.]
;W[cc]
(;B[fq]C[*X*: I prefer just invading C3.  No matter which way he blocks, his formation is far from ideal.  F3 is just inviting an attack, which is what W wants here.]

(;W[hq]C[*X*: You're lucky he gives you a second chance to invade the corner.  See variation.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp];W[dr]C[*X*: It's definitely non-standard.  Just playing hane at D5 seems sufficient.  If you're scared, you can also just play C2 here and accept gote, but that seems weak.

---

I was unfamiliar with this move, too.];B[cn];W[dm];B[do];W[eo]
;B[cr];W[dn];B[co];W[fp]C[*X*: Seems a pretty good result for you, since it ends in sente, and with a bigger corner than you get otherwise.]

(;B[ll]C[*X*: If you want to emphasize your own moyo instead of going for a deeper reduction, the correct move is O7.

The trouble with M8 is that it's both too far, and not far enough.  If it was closer, at O7, W could not separate you from your right side.  If it was further, at K7, then O7 would not be as severe, and you could just Q8 and leave him with the problem of deciding how to attack.

---

My "global" move which also aimed at reducing his territory. At least it *looks* nice, though it proved somehow loose.]
;W[nm]C[*X*: Now you're in trouble.  M8 is too far.]
(;B[ol]C[*X*: Defending your territory and letting him cut off M8 is inconsistent.  You have to continue with your plan by playing O8.  See variation.]
;W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[ik];W[lk];B[nj];W[fj];B[jh]
(;W[dh]C[*X*: Yes, C12 is normal, and can cause you big problems here.  See variation.

---

Isn't C12 the usual invasion point?
Going trough some variations, it doesn't look too effective here, though.]
;B[ch];W[ci]
(;B[bh]C[*X*: This is weak.  You have to cut.  See variation.

Somehow strange move..];W[di];B[bc]C[D10 can connect to my bottom left corner with C10/C8 combination or something like that...
When I got sente back, I wanted to play this sequence, and the top right corner was still open, too. I got neither of this two points in the end, which left me feeling quite uncomfortable. :)]
;W[jf];B[lh];W[jd]C[*X*: This is a mistake for W.  His upper left group is in dire danger after B17... if he drives this stone towards that group, he's going to get himself in trouble.]

(;B[kl]C[*X*: You should not ignore K16.  See variation.];W[ml]
;B[kd]C[*X*: Oh, okay, you do play this after all.  Well, this move is good anyway.  There are lots of places to go wrong in the coming sequence, though.

----

The whole following sequence wasn't well worked out by me. Not sure what I was really thinking about when playing it, probably not thinking at all. ;)]
;W[kc];B[id];W[je];B[fb]C[*X*: This is not bad.  You could also connect at J17 and play the more complicated variations I showed a few moves ago.]
;W[hc];B[ec];W[ed];B[cb];W[db];B[dc];W[eb]
(;B[cd]C[*X*: We all make silly mistakes like this sometimes.  But yes,  F17 is way, way, way better. :-)

----

Why didn't I simply play F17? Strange. :)];W[fc];B[hf]C[*X*: No, it's too late now to pull out J16.

---

I didn't intend to pull out my J16 stones (which I should have probably done) but instead I wanted to strenghten the connection of my reducing stones in white's territory to invade just a little deeper afterwards. :)]
;W[ig];B[ih];W[hg];B[in];W[jl]C[White misread here.];B[jk];W[kk]
;B[jm];W[mi];B[ki];W[li];B[oh];W[mh];B[lg];W[mg];B[mf];W[ql]
C[*X*: This is ridiculous.  W must feel that he's way behind, but actually, it's relatively close.  Let's estimate the score (before W R8).

Black:

Lower left: 10
Upper left: 12
Right side: 50
Prisoners: 2
TOTAL: 74

White:

Left side: 6
Lower side: 14
Top side: 37
Prisoners: 6
Komi: 6.5
TOTAL: 69.5

So, White is 4.5 points behind... this can easily be made up with a good endgame.  There's no need for ridiculous invasions.  Besides, when this invasion fails, as it surely will, W will have lost some endgame potential around here.  Several points, at least.

---

Deep invasion!
Is there any way for white to live here? Still, there's connecting aji around R14?]
;B[qn];W[rj];B[qi];W[ri];B[rh];W[qj];B[pi];W[rm];B[rn];W[rk]
;B[sl];W[sm];B[pk]C[*X*: You do need this move.  Otherwise W Q8 would make miai of connecting or living.

Just wanted to make it sure. :)];W[om];B[pm];W[pl];B[ok];W[pp]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[pr];W[mr]C[*X*: This is huge.];B[op]C[*X*: Too small.]
;W[oo];B[po]C[*X*: Yes, exactly.  S16 is very, very big.  If W answers, then you play D1.

Capturing seemed way too small in the moment I put my stone down on the board. The top right corner looks much, much bigger... :/]
;W[re];B[rf]C[*X*: Much too small.  W should tenuki.];W[qd]
C[*X*: Weak.];B[ef];W[ff];B[eg]C[Another quickly played nonsense move. :) He answered, at least...]
;W[fg];B[ms];W[ls];B[ns];W[kr];B[hp];W[jj];B[ij];W[kj]
(;B[ii]C[*X*: This is a wasted move. You can live inside and get more points in the process, instead of connecting.]
;W[ho];B[ip];W[iq];B[io];W[bi];B[bk]C[Seems an overplay, B8 looks better.

*X*: Yes.];W[bl];B[bm];W[al];B[ak];W[ck];B[am];W[cl];B[ds];W[es]
;B[cs];W[er];B[cc];W[gb];B[da];W[fa];B[oc];W[od];B[rc]
(;W[qc]C[*X*: W is very nice to you.  You shouldn't get anything here.  See variation.]
;B[rd];W[rb];B[qe];W[ce]C[*X*: W should play T17.  Failing to atari leaves you with a very large follow-up.]
;B[de];W[cg];B[bg];W[dg]
(;B[be]C[*X*: No, this is good, but maybe too early.  T18 is very, very big, since W omitted playing the atari at T17.  But after playing any sente moves you can find, you should play here.  Otherwise B can capture two stones.  See variation.

----

Reflex-like played, yet unnecessary.];W[eh];B[go];W[cm];B[bo]
;W[gp];B[gn]C[*X*: No, this is okay.  H7 doesn't work if you answer correctly.

H7 jumped into my eye just after I played this, making me wish to have simply captured instead.]
;W[hm]
(;B[im]C[*X*: This is your mistake.  See variation.];W[hl];B[il]
;W[hn]C[*X*: Ouch is right.  This is where you lost the game.  That's about 13 points you just lost.

----

Ouch >.<];B[jq]C[Another silly move...];W[jr];B[kq]C[...even worse :/]
;W[sc]C[*X*: Damn.  You should have played T18 long ago. :-(]
;B[se];W[df];B[ee];W[fe];B[ce];W[lm];B[gj]C[Ran really out of creativity here and merely just filled a random point.]
;W[gk];B[gi];W[fi];B[ai];W[aj];B[bj];W[cj];B[ln];W[km]
(;B[jl]LB[jl:A][kn:B]C[*X*: Yes.  L6 is about 5-6 points better than connecting, by my quick estimate.

----

Maybe the variation instead?];W[kn];B[ko];W[lo];B[mn];W[mm]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[jn]C[I definitely played too fast here, as all those strange, unnecessary moves indicate.]

;W[aj];B[sd];W[sb];B[ah];W[ea];B[ca];W[ni]C[*X*: You guys have been playing dame for a while now while there are still point-scoring moves like this left on the board.]
;B[oi];W[pe];B[pf];W[ld];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf];W[gh];B[jg];W[if]
;B[mj];W[lj];B[on];W[nn];B[hh];W[hj];B[hi];W[hk];B[ne];W[nf]
;B[kg];W[nh];B[tt];W[tt]C[*X*: So, W won by 17.5 with komi.  You lost about 13 points on move 177 and about 6 on move 201.  Another 5 or 6 points by playing B9 instead of B8... 3 by missing out on T18... something like 12 points by your mistake in the top left, by playing C16 instead of F17...

So, yes.  You strategically outplayed your opponent, but gave up nearly 40 points through careless, local blunders and oversights.  The best advice I can give you, then, is to play more slowly, and do at least a little bit of reading on every move.  Your blunders weren't long, complicated sequences... just reading two moves in advance would have been enough to avoid most of them.

Anyway, I feel your pain, because I do the same thing all the time, turning easy wins into losses because of silly, easy-to-avoid mistakes.

Hope this review has been helpful.

----

Still, I was quite content with my fuseki and middle-game play, which in fact must mean I'm not able to spot the turning mistakes - a point I'd appreciate you comments on much.

I also tried a variation starting with me capturing on move 175, in which black won by roughly 5 points, but as mentioned above, my endgame isn't all that accurate.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review my game - hope you had fun with it, too.]
