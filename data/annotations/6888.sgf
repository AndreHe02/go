C[Hi

This game was a league game for my club. So I tried to gave my best. That's why I think it might be suitable for a review to get some better insights. My opponent is a German 1kyu, and I am probably around that level too. (German 1kyu, KGS 1kyu)

Although I won this game in the end, I think, I fell behind in fuseki and early midgame rather easily. I was rather lucky to turn it around.
The beginning and early midgame are the topics I am most concerned about.

Hello, i will mark my comments with [K\]];B[pd];W[dq];B[dd]
;W[qp];B[do];W[cm];B[cq];W[cp];B[dp];W[co];B[cn];W[dn];B[bn]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[bo];B[eq];W[bm];B[en]
(;W[an]C[I have never seen this before. Instead of A6 the usual play would be D7, however I could not find a good way to make use of it.

[K\]: White lose good follow up in case black makes moyo here, see variation.]
;B[op];W[mq];B[no];W[mo]C[Here I am not used to this move. This was quite surprising.]
;B[mn]C["If someone attaches, do hane" I gave this a try.];W[mp]

(;B[ln]C[[K\]: Not sure this move is good now, your wall at E3 is not very useful now.
See variation.]
(;W[nn]C[[K\]: This cut looks bad, usually white connects at P3.]
;B[on];W[nm];B[om];W[nl];B[ol];W[nk];B[ok];W[nj]
(;B[ph]C[I am very sceptic about the last moves, but this was the best thing I could think of.]
;W[oq]C[[K\]: Now white is quite happy as he had 3 weak groups and now just 1 left.]
;B[nh]C[[K\]: I am not sure about this move, looks fine if you want to run with M6 stones later but if you plan to leave them you could probably play samething else.]
;W[jp];B[jd]C[My plan here is to get a huge moyo.
Is this alright? K6 would have been my alternative, but I prefered the less aggressive play.

[K\]: If you want to avoid fighting this looks ok.];W[cf];B[fd]
;W[ef]
(;B[gf]C[[K\]:Looks like to many moves in this area, taking corner might be better now.]
;W[bd];B[dg];W[df];B[fh];W[cc];B[dc];W[jn];B[oc]C[I thought the timing is right to play this rather slow move.

[K\]: I think this is biggest move now, if white invade corner he can take away a lot of points.]
;W[kd]C[This was an interesting play of my opponent, again.
L17 or L15]
(;B[ke]C[[K\]: I don't like this move, you are strong in this area and this way white can survive easyly.
See variation.];W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[hc];W[hb];B[kc]C[Quite complicated fight.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[mc];W[fb];B[ff]C[I am unsure about this move, is it ok?

[K\]: Looks fine, hard to find anything better, anyway this result looks good for white.]
;W[pi]C[How should you react to this?

[K\]:The move in game looks fine.];B[oi];W[qh];B[pj];W[qi];B[qj]
;W[rd];B[qf]C[Here I thought about giving him the corner and getting the side.

[K\] might be right, it would be hard to kill all of white stones.]
;W[rf];B[rg];W[qc];B[qg];W[pb];B[li];W[lk];B[kk]C[Here I could find a better idea than to put stress on the aji here and get stronger.

[K\]: I think it is good move.];W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[ik];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[lj];B[ki];W[dj];B[hq];W[iq];B[hr];W[dh];B[eh]C[I think this move probably is a mistake.

[K\]: Looks little strange but the aji you gained later was for sure worth it.]
;W[ei];B[qn];W[ro];B[rn];W[gj];B[hi];W[em];B[pq]C[[K\]: Good idea.]
;W[pp];B[nq];W[or];B[pr];W[np];B[oo];W[nr];B[rq]C[This turned out better than I thought. I felt quite behind until that point, and I don't know why.
But this gave the hope and power to be able to turn this game.

[I think white could give up just part of the corner and safe his 2 stones. See variation.]

;W[gb];B[ho]C[[K\]This is not big, B2 is much bigger.];W[br]
C[Few  points and in sente for white, very big.];B[dr];W[fn]
;B[cd];W[bc];B[ch]C[Here again, I saw some aji in the corner and tried to get a bit from it.]
;W[di];B[be];W[bf];B[ce];W[ae];B[eg];W[cg];B[io];W[jo];B[db]
C[It's not sente, but it looks so huge to me.
I think I am still behind, but I tried my best in endgame.
Please let me know, if you can show me better moves.];W[gi]
;B[gh];W[kj];B[ji];W[mi];B[mh];W[sg];B[sh];W[sf]C[There is same tesuji here. See variation.]

(;B[qd];W[re];B[rb];W[rc];B[ob];W[ra];B[bb]C[Maybe this wasn't the best move, but it turned out good, thank to my opponent.

[K\] Looks nice.];W[cb];B[ca];W[ab];B[ba];W[ea];B[ad];W[ac]

;B[de];W[gp];B[hp];W[fr];B[fq];W[gq];B[gr]C[[K\]:I think black played good game , i think that sametimes he was just 2 easy for white, giving him easy life at top and letting him to connect at P3 were probably main mystakes.]

(;B[jc]C[I think it is fine to play solid, even like this, white has no base so you are free to attack him now.]
;W[kf];B[kh]))
(;B[bd]))
(;B[pq]C[[K\]:Maybe just cut white groups, he is weak everywhere and you probably get corner.]
;W[qq]C[[K\]: If white plays in corner now he is still not totaly alive and still 2 weak group on outside.]

(;B[pq]LB[ln:B][qq:A]C[[K\]This move is also possible and might be better now.

White can probably think about A and B.]
(;W[qq];B[ln]C[This is good for black as white can not connect anymore and is left with 2 groups and neither or them is strong now.]
)
(;W[ln];B[nm];W[qm];B[lm];W[kn];B[qq];W[qj]C[[K\]This is also same joseki and might be better as white and black wall are facing each other and black might be the one who plays there first.]

(;W[dm]C[Later if black samehow creates moyo on the side.];B[tt]
;W[gn]C[This is good move to reduce that moyo.
Ofcourse black may not create any moyo here so it isn't  that bad for white.]
