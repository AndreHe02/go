C[Ronin: Hallo, in this game I'm white and I would like to know the main errors I did. I'm concerned about the opening and/or the attack&defence. Thanks.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[co];W[ep];B[dm]LB[ck:B][jq:A]C[A and B are the follow up moves for white.  It isn't necessary for white to play them at this time.  As you play out the game, keep in mind about these two points.  It will help you to determine how to play the rest of the board.]
;W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[ic]LB[jc:A]C[This extension is too wide.  The proper play is at A.  Black can invade easily.  Please see variation.]

(;B[me]C[This is a bad move for black.  He removes the aji of the upper side.]
;W[ld]C[White says thank you.  Now black can't invade the upper side.]
;B[pg]
(;W[qm]LB[ck:A]C[Now that white has developed the upper side, at the appropriate time he can play A to make a good framework.  Please see variation.]
;B[qk];W[pk];B[ql]LB[pj:A]C[Black overplays here.  The normal response is A.]

;W[nk];B[qi];W[on];B[po];W[pn];B[mq]LB[qq:A]C[Black's corner isn't secure yet.  White can still invade at A.]
;W[cj]LB[ck:A][cm:D][cn:C][dn:B]C[The usual move is to pincer at A.  That way when white attacks at B, black can't connect at C.  He has to play at D.]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[gq];W[gp]LB[cp:A][bq:B]C[Play at A to secure the corner.  It's also very big in territory.  Compared to a move at B by black, it's worth about 20 points.  The game move helps black to strengthen the lower side.]
;B[fq]LB[hq:A]C[Simply playing at A is sufficient for black.  Take profit at the lower side.]
;W[fp];B[ec]LB[ed:C][hp:A][hq:B]TR[ic]C[A is very big for black.  Likewise, B is huge for white.

For black's kikari at the upper right corner, C is better because of white's marked stone.]

(;W[de]LB[dc:A]C[Play A to punish black for his mistake.  Please see variation.]
;B[cc];W[bc];B[cb];W[fd];B[dd];W[ed]LB[bd:A]TR[cj][dj]C[A is better.  This seals black in, and goes well with the two marked white stones.]
;B[bd];W[dc];B[ce];W[dd];B[be];W[bb];B[ch];W[dh]LB[kf:B][eh:A]
C[Playing at A casts a wider net and avoids contact play, which could help black.  White doesn't have to kill black.  Just seal him in.  Later a move around B would enlarge white's framework nicely.]
;B[dg];W[cf]LB[eg:B][fg:C][eh:A]C[White is trying too hard to kill black.  Play at A, followed by black B and white C.  The objective is to seal black in.]
