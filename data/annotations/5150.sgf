RE[W+7.50]
TM[900]

C[Dear Reviewer: First off, I'd like to thank you for taking time to look over my game. I played black in this game, and lost by 7.5 pts.  I know of a few of the mistakes I made, but I know there are many I missed.  I seem to keep getting to 15k, then hitting a wall and losing like 10 games in a row and I know I'm missing something easy, I just can't see what it is.  I'll start my comments with J:]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[pj];W[nc];B[oc]C[[Nick\]:  1st way to improve your game:  NEVER make this move without having a stone around K16.  White's play at K16 is too perfect of a development from his two stone wall.  You can't give that up. 

Your basic choices are:
R14 - most solid
Q14- more moyo-ey, good with chinese opening
M17/L16 - complicated fighting.  Never a dull moment!];W[nd]
;B[pf];W[jd]C[too easy for white];B[jq]C[J: I wasn't sure about this move.  I couldn't decide between this or something around C10.  This is the part of the game I seem to be having to most problem with (from my view that is). Is there somewhere else that would've been better here?

If I were I pro, I would tell you which is better.  At your level, (or at mine, or at any kyu's level), either is fine.]
;W[dj];B[gq]C[J: Would it have been better to protect around R6?  I was suprised that he didn't invade there.

[Nick\]: Yeah, I'd have made shimari.  Again, though, it could be a difference of a point or so.]
;W[gd]C[lame, lame, lame.  This move is so slow!  should have been around Q5.]
;B[qo];W[dg]C[even lamer.  no point in all that reinforcment since C17 is always available.  I'd probably have jumped in right now.  Also, O14 is a big move now.  You've got the advantage because C17 takes a hunge chunk of his territory and you can double approach D4 with C7, so *maybe* you can think of them as miai and take O14 now.]
;B[mq]C[Very slow.];W[nf]C[I trust you can see how big this move is]
;B[jj]C[I like it];W[jh];B[gn]C[I like D7 more, because then you can attack it along the F5 area and build that same wall more naturally, without giving up the whole left size.]
;W[dm]C[White plays all 4th line.  You have one side of all 4th line and one side of all 3rd line.  Ideally, you want to mix both 3rd and 4th line.]
;B[mm]C[nah, this move is too slow.  It's single purpose; avoid single purpose moves.  If he plops a stone at N7, you can attack it for great profit.  P12 prevents an invasion at Q12, and pushes white's boundries.]
;W[ph]C[J: I wasn't really sure how to respond to this.  I did ok in the exchange, but mainly because he missed something big.  Would it have been better to block here before N7?  How should I have responded once he did play this?

[Nick\]:  Ok, this is one of the situations that knowing the rules bumps you up at least a stone.

The rule is that if you want to connect on top play on the bottom, and if you want to connect on the bottom play on the top.

See variations.]

(;B[mi]SQ[mh]TR[ni][nh]C[the three marked stones, when the square spot is empty, form the dread "Empty Triangle."  It's the worst af bad shape.  Never play it, gain a stone or two.

(;B[li]C[See variation];W[ki];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[rh];B[rj]
;W[qe]C[J: This one really gave me trouble.  How should I have responded to it?

[Nick\]: I think if you connect honestly he still doesn't live.  No one likes to be pushed around, but it's usually a good idea to connect.]

(;B[rf];W[pe]
(;B[of]C[J: Better at P15?

[Nick\]:  Nah, play P15 and you'll lose it all];W[oe];B[ng]
;W[qf];B[qg];W[rg];B[qh]C[J: This is where I get lucky.  He missed the atari at R11]
;W[ri];B[qi];W[rk];B[sj];W[re];B[kh]C[gotta get C17 in.  It's the biggest move on the board.]
;W[ji];B[gk];W[gi]
(;B[nb]C[J: This went really bad for me.  It really seems like there should be a way for me to live in this corner.  Should I have extended into the corner before this hane?

[Nick\]: in theory, yes.  I can't find life here, though.];W[pb]
;B[qb];W[ob];B[mb];W[pc]
(;B[kg]C[slow!  Jump out to M16.  (see var)];W[ld];B[dr];W[cq]
;B[cc]C[J: I knew I was way behind here, and this seemed like the best way to be able to take some territory from him without much risk.  would an invasion of one of the side been better?

No.  This should have come a long time ago, by either player]

[Nick\]: Not bad at all.  Word of Wisdom:  The biggest plays in the game are on the boundries where two moyos meet.  this was a moyo game if ever the was a moyo game, and you let him define much of the boundries.  When you push, he has to block, and you can push again, and he has to block again.  Good fun.  Moves like N7 are wasted, because they don't push.  If you want a purely defensive move, push everywhere first.  You push, they block, you push, they block, you push, they block, you defend.  Gold.  Your joseki mistake in the top left was somewhat costly-  that's a joseki to learn thoroughly, because it's so common.  Learn the Triple Hane variation- it'll throw a lot of people at your level for a loop.  Sensei's Library will tell you everything you need to know about it.

Good Luck,
Nick George
