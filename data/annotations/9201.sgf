AB[pd][dp]C[ Hello ! I'm Tilwen, Black in this game. I'm back in KGS game, and I felt a bit under pressure all game long. Could you help me find my big mistakes, and when did I miss chances to take a lead ? I put some questions later in the game. Thanks !


FM: Hello Tilwen, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with FM: as my nick is FieldMouse]

FM: protecting from here is very small. The lower side can be considered a strong group, but there is not really much space to make many points there. Black should rather focus on gaining outside influence and attack white's thin positions on the upper left and lower right. Both marked stones should be on the outside.]

C[FM: now note that white has 3 big weaknesses: the cut at A, the one eye at B and the group at C. Now a nice plan for black should be this: I will make a nice solid wall on the marked line, making my own group and the C group safe. Then I will play at D and make miai of A and B. Then I clearly win.]

;W[de];B[cd];W[jg]TR[cd][de]C[FM: the marked exchange was very bad for white as the group is not alive now]

(;B[or];W[mq];B[pr];W[je]LB[rb:B][df:A]TR[cj][dk]C[FM: After this move the game is finished, there are only endgame moves left.

I think that the game was quite okay for black until white started running with the two marked stone. After that happened black had a good chance to control the game by attacking the white stones violently, aiming at A, B and invading at the lower right corner. Unfortunately black made several slow moves which allowed white to fight with his inferior position and white managed to save everything (except the lower right corner, but it looks like white was not really trying in there). I hope that my tips, especially about the how-to-attack part of the game will be useful.
