C[HIRSI: I played white in this game. I have written some comments about my reasoning and I would like to hear if my thoughts are sensible.

During the game I often thought that black's moves were sloppy and I thought that I was winning quite easily. However, I got in trouble and my groups survived only barely (one of them really should have died). After surviving I thought again that I was having an easy win, but in the end I had only 2.5 points more on the board, even if I thought that black gave me many points in the endgame. But I can not find my mistakes.

I am really looking forward to your comments.

--
* I've marked my comments with stars. An interesting game, but you got yourself into too much trouble. One of your two weaks groups should have died. Some of the variations I have provided are speculative, so they probably will not stand up to too much scrutiny.  I hope you will still get some strategic ideas out of them :)
You played a much better endgame than black in my opinion..]
;B[pp];W[qd];B[cp];W[cc]C[HIRSI: Recently I have often used this kind of low patterns in IGS. I would like to hear comments if I make moves which do not work well with my low positions during the game.

--];B[dd]C[* The top right looks more interesting right now for black...]
;W[cd];B[de];W[cf];B[df];W[cg];B[dc]LB[kc:A][ce:B][be:C][bf:D]
[bd:E]C[HIRSI: I was tempted to play A now, but I did not want to let black to play sequence B-C-D-E, cutting my stones apart. It might be unreasonable for black, but I wanted to play safe here.

* Nothing wrong with that, but the move you selected may not have been the best..]

(;W[ce];B[id]LB[od:A]C[HIRSI: I was happy to get a chance to make a shimari. I expected black to play A.

--];W[nc];B[eq]LB[cj:A][kc:B][kq:C][qj:D][qn:E]C[HIRSI: Funny, now it looks like black has at least 3 stones more on board than white. :)

My thoughts here were:
1) A and B are big points, but not very urgent.
2) C would prevent black to make a big lower side, but it does not build white's position.
3) After these thoughts D starts to look big, and then I decide to play E.

--
* D looks very good as an extension. E lets black pincer but looks playable.]
;W[qn]
(;B[qo]LB[nq:A][pj:B]C[HIRSI: I guess this helps white to build right side. My choice as black would have been A.
--
* Black should probably pincer, see variation. This move is indeed very bad. If black A,
white B looks very good for white.];W[pn];B[np];W[pj]C[* White is very happy with this position.]
;B[cj]LB[jq:A][kq:B][nn:C][eo:D][lq:E]TR[np]C[HIRSI: Now I would like to know what options I have to reduce/invade black's position.

My thoughts were:
1) A or B would aim sliding under the marked stone, but black can pincer my invasion and I do not have room to make a 2-space extension.
2) Or perhaps I could build the right side with with C and play D after black closes the bottom.

--
* Black has strenghtened your stones, so the right point at the bottom is probably E.
See variation. But the game move seems to work out.]
(;W[kq];B[mq]C[HIRSI: Here I thought that black's move can not be good. I was really happy to get a chance to make a 2-space extension.

--];W[hq];B[qh]LB[oh:A][qi:B][rj:C][ri:D]C[HIRSI: Uh, I really hate this kind of moves. I was really unsure what to do, but I thought about A, B, and C.   --
* Your move is good. Quite severe. A is bad, black lives with territory. For B, a suitable continuation is difficult. D is even more aggressive than your move, but thinner.]
;W[rj]
(;B[qf]LB[qe:A]C[* Black should play at A. See variation]
(;W[pe]LB[rd:A][pd:B][od:C]C[* This move makes it easy for black (creates a weakness at A. See variation)
White should defend at B and take it easy. The normal move at C still leaves the weakness at A.]

(;B[og];W[kc]LB[ho:A]C[HIRSI: Is this the biggest point now? I also thought that I could strenghten my bottom group with A.

--
* It seems important at this point to keep attacking the weak black group. See comments in the following diagrams. Playing A looks slow. The two stones are not in too much danger right now.]
;B[jc]C[* This move endangers the black group on the right...]
;W[kd];B[hf]LB[cl:A][bp:B]C[HIRSI: Again I thought that black's move can not be good.  I was happy to get a chance to invade left side. My options were A and B.

--
* You should keep attacking the weak black group. That will give you some strength in the center so you can destroy the territory on the left. The problem is finding a good attacking move...]

(;W[bp];B[bq];W[co];B[cq]
(;W[do]C[* A bit heavy. Pincering the lone black stone is better. Variation..]
;B[cm]C[* you are in trouble..]
(;W[fo]LB[dm:A]C[HIRSI: White did something wrong here? Black's cut is now too obvious. Perhaps I should lean against black's left side group with A.

--
* Since black is quite strong now on the left, leaning on A looks good. The last thing you want is to force black to split you.. Variation.]
;B[fp]C[* Oh dear, you've forced black to split you :)];W[gp]
;B[go]C[HIRSI: And now the fight favors black (right?). I would like to hear what kind of things you would think while fighting here.

--
* This looks like an uphill struggle for white. The left side group looks slightly weaker than the bottom. Sacrificing either is not an option. It looks very difficult.]
;W[fn];B[ho];W[ep]TR[gp][hq]C[* this atari is no good. It  costs the stones on the right a liberty! Black would not play there at the moment either but attack on a large scale.]

;W[no]C[HIRSI: I was very unsure about this.
--
* See comments from two moves ago. You should make life before you loose sente (and then have a choice between dying and losing points). The way you played in the game would have killed you. See later variation.]
;B[oo]C[HIRSI: Now it looks to me that white is in big trouble.

--];W[on];B[mo];W[mn];B[nn];W[ln];B[lm];W[nm];B[no];W[nl]C[* You have no time for this! See variation for a quick death.. Note that your moves have done nothing but solidify black before setting up your own death...]

(;B[ko];W[lp]C[* there is no time for this!!]
(;B[kl]LB[km:A]C[HIRSI: Shouldn't black kill white with M2? Or is white dead anyway?
--
* black should kill white. white cannot cut at A anyway! But then again, black could have done that a couple of moves ago anyway. This should have given you some hope..]
;W[lr]C[* I think white lives with this move.];B[jr];W[mr];B[nr]
;W[ir];B[lq]C[HIRSI: White has time to save the four stones, right?
--
* Yes. But it's bigger to save the two at the bottom :) (Which would capture the black stone and leave the endgame play on the edge.. The four stones are not useful as cutting stones anymore anyway.]

;W[eo];B[hs]LB[bo:A]C[HIRSI: Black is wasting good ko-threats?
--
* if black is feeling uneasy, this is ok. Also, black does not want A to become sente]
;W[is];B[fs];W[hr];B[hl];W[gl];B[ij]C[HIRSI: I guess white really should die here.

--];W[ch];B[bk]C[* This move is completely unnecessary. The losing move.]
;W[eh]C[HIRSI: Phew... Now I thought that white is again winning the game, but perhaps I was too confident here.
--];B[fi];W[ei];B[re];W[rd];B[rg]C[HIRSI: Black S7 or C18 instead of this?
--
* C18 is gote. S7 ? I guess you mean S6 or S5 ? S5 is the right move. White will probably answer. But I think black's move is good. If white plays there, black has to run again.]

(;W[ro]LB[rn:A]C[* this is gote. See variation. If you have to play here, A is correct.]

;B[sd];W[sc];B[se];W[rc];B[ri]LB[rk:A]C[HIRSI: L18 here?
--
* This move is good. Aims at A. Unfortunately, black missed that point in the game. L18 is not that big.]
