Round 6   23.05.94

White : Klaus H. Sorensen 2k
Black : Helmut Weber      1d

Komi  : 5.5

Time  : 75 + 10/5
Result: White wins by 6.5];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc]L[eq][pd]C[KHS : This is an  opening I do not like to play against.. I do not like to leave the third  corner to black, but neither to I like the idea
in the variation.

KP : Nothing wrong with the variation; it is often played that way.]
(;W[eq]N[a]C[KHS : I decided to go Shusaku style.. It may have been sure-win for  black in the 1850'ties, but today is a different matter. I have the
komi.

KP :   8->];B[qd];W[de]L[ce]C[The modern way to play. The classic move is at  `a'.]
;B[hp];W[en];B[eo];W[fo]L[fp]C[KHS : I am not very familiar with this  joseki. I was rather worried about  a black double-hane at a, since I did not see any immediate
answer for it. This is not covered in Ishida.

KP : The double hane looks rather dangerous for black. He may be able  to grab some thicknes, but looks like loosing a lot in the corner.]

(;B[do]C[Standard.];W[fp];B[fn];W[gn];B[fm];W[ho]
(;B[jp]L[em]M[jp]C[KHS : Up to  here, it is actually joseki, which came as a bit of a  surprise to me after the game. I am quite joseki illiterate.

KP : Another peaceful way for black is to capture at `a',  but the marked move is more common]
;W[mp]L[cn][lq]C[KHS :  Apparently, a is the tesuji for white here. However, I  played as I did in order to put some pressure on black, and
form something which could turn into teritory at a later stage.

KP : The move at `a' is indeed tesuji and the proper way to continue
if you want to play on the left (see the variation), but there is
nothing wrong with attacking the two black stones immediately.  However, I would prefer playing `b' instead, as it puts more pressure  on black. See the variation for a possible continuation.]

(;B[dl]M[fm][fn][mp]L[em]C[KHS : In  the normal joseki, white can capture the marked stones
 and game outward influence. However, that means black
gets sente to approach the white hoshi stone or make a shimari.
 Now white has sente, and the marked stone in place. I do
not think I made a big mistake here.

KP : This black move is better at `a', which leaves no white forcing  moves on the outside. Now you see the problem with the marked
white move: there is no really effective continuation for  attacking the two black stones.]
;W[ci]C[KHS : I  wanted to prevent a pincer on my approach stone.  Such a pince would work too well with blacks thickness.]
;B[ee]L[ef]M[ci]C[KHS  : Attaching at a, and playing a joseki I was fairly  familiar with would give black perfect thickness, and a white
wall facing an uninteresting area. So once again I dived  into uncharted joseki teritory..

KP : Playing `a' looks in fact possible. The thing to avoid here is the
usual continuation, because the marked stone is already in place.  See the variation for a suggestion.]

(;W[cc]L[ed][dd][df]C[KHS :  I know this is the first move of a joseki, but I am not familiar with the  variations.

KP : Joseki it is, but it involves many very very difficult variations if  black
plays at `b'. See Ishida. I don't like black's answer at `a'; this gives  white a
perfect result locally. The third possibility, black `c', seems to work  much better for black. See the variation.]

(;B[ed]N[a];W[df];B[ef];W[dg]C[Now white's stones are all well placed.]
;B[od]L[cb]C[The forcing move  at `a' should be played first, I believe.]
;W[pj]L[jc]C[KHS : My choices for this  move was the actual move (perhaps low ?) or at a. I chose this because it  was double purpose,
extending from my own hoshi stone, and limiting a black extension from his  shimari.

KP : The high move seems better, because its central orientation
helps to threaten the two weak black stones and counteracts blacks
thickness a little more. Black can't really hope to fix his moyo with  just one move, so an invasion seems less urgent.]
;B[qh]C[KHS : When  black extends here, I must invade. No question.];W[jc]
;B[lc];W[gc];B[cb];W[bc];B[bb]L[he]M[gc][jc]C[Too slow; not sente. Better put some pressure on the marked white  stones,
for example with `a' (attack + strengthen own stones)];W[dd]
(;B[ec]L[fc]C[A move at `a' looks better. It forces white into heavier  shape and
permits black to keep the iniciative locally.];W[he]L[ge]C[KHS :  Maybe a is better, putting more direct pressure on the
 black wall. Eventhough it can easily get eyes or run, it
will be gote for black to do so.

KP : No, your move looks better. It attacks the black wall just as
much as `a' does, and it is better shape. Remember: `stay away from
thickness' and note that the black wall is easy to defend if neccessary.]
;B[hg];W[jf]C[KHS : Trying to play light, and being fairly successful.

KP : Yep. white's overall position looks rather good now.];B[hi];W[ln]M[jp][hp]C[KHS : Here I wanted to get something cooking on the marked  stones, and making a big moyo at the same time.

KP: A very important move now that black is aproaching the  weak white group from the top.]
;B[io];W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[jm];W[cr]L[il]M[hi][hg]C[KHS : My  group is fairly weak, and I did not enjoy the prospect of running head on  into the marked black stone. I wanted
eyespace. Perhaps I should have pushed once more at a to avoid getting shut  in.

KP : `a' is MUCH more urgent than the move you played. As long as you  are outside and thus attacking blacks lower stones, you need not worry  too much about eyespace. Also, an extension at `a' can be viewed as a  splitting attack between the lower black group and the marked stones.
(Of course, you keep extending if black keeps pushing).
All in all, a pivotal point to play which should have given you an easy  game.]
;B[il]L[jl]C[KHS : This looks very hard. I had  anticipated an extension at a, but black gets away with it.

KP : hard for white, not hard for black.]
(;W[jl]L[hq]C[KHS : I just had  to cut here..

KP : Dangerous. I would prefer swallowing my pride and preparing
eye-space with white `a'.];B[hm];W[hn];B[gm];W[go]C[KHS : This  was, of course, fairly unpleasant..]

(;B[lm]L[gq]C[Black should play at `a'. This  attack whites eye-space and
enlarges blacks. An important area for both! White is  then forced to live very small while black `locks up'
at both sides. The move black played just helps white with his moyo.];W
[mm];B[ll];W[ml];B[jk]M[ml][mm]C[KHS : I think the cutting stone served  its purpose by letting me  play the two marked stones to harden my moyo, and gaining sente.]
;W[qp]M[mm][ml]C[KHS : Taking points here must be good. A black attachment at the  same point would be nasty and could render the two marked stones
inefficient.];B[fq]C[KHS : Good point I thought. It had me  worried.];W
[fr];B[gq];W[ep];B[gr]C[KHS : If black does not play here, white  can play there in sente.
 But is this the right move for black ? Whites position looks very
unsecure.

KP : Looks fine for black.];W[cq]C[KHS : This must be tesuji in this  position. Now white must be sure of two eyes.]

(;B[bq]L[er]C[What if black `a'?  White seems to live (just!!!) unless  I overlooked something, but the life is smaller and black gets more
profit.];W[br];B[bp];W[dp];B[cn];W[er]C[KHS : White is off the  hook, but getting shut in like this  cannot be good. However, looking at the whole board position,
I would say it is even..

KP : seems so.];B[rj];W[ql];B[lq]L[mr]C[KHS : This gives black a few points of  teritory, but also  helps white turn the lower side into teritory. It looks just
about loose enough to be invadeable.

KP : An invasion of the lower side looks unreasonable. `a' seems
to be the furthest a normal mortal could go, but that move is potentially
subject to counterattacks. The move played looks fine.];W[mq]
(;B[le]L[oh][kb]C[Slow. This does not enclose a moyo because of the weak  point at `a', which white got in the end. It seems better to play some  double sente edge moves first. See the variation.]
;W[rd]C[Nice  move!];B[qc];W[kb]L[rl]M[le]C[It looks better for black to ignore that move and play on
teh right side, e.g. the sequence starting at `a' which
was shown in the previous variation. That would make the  marked stone work.]
;B[lb];W[la];B[ma];W[ka];B[nb]C[Very  unpleasant for black! white is now otu of danger,
and black gets far too little.];W[oh]C[KHS : Trying to keep blacks moyo under  control. This must be the keypoint in this position.]
;B[jd];W[id];B[kc];W[ib]C[KHS : I feel the last few moves by black just helped white secure definite  eyeform for his group.

KP : Agreed, aji keshi.];B[lr];W[mr];B[ms];W[ns];B[ls];W[or];B[je]M[oh]
C[Nonononono, this is far too small to take gote for.  Black definitely has to get active on the right side
and think of some way to harm the marked stone.];W[hf];B[gg];W[gs]C[The right side is more important. I would ignore
this move for a while as black.];B[hs];W[fs];B[hr];W[lp];B[kp];W[of]L[ck]
C[Nice  move I think, but `a' looks big too ...];B[pg];W[og];B[bj]C[KHS :  Very big point. I was quite annoyed that black got this..]
;W[bi];B[cj];W[dj]
(;B[ck]L[dk]C[KHS : Fortunately in gote..

KP : Black could have played at `a' instead. That looses
a bit on the side, but it insures sente or else a big centre
territory.];W[pf];B[qf];W[ph];B[qg];W[nd]C[KHS : Tesuji ?

KP : looks like it, but I would go there before playing the  two marked stones (aji-keshi, see the variation). Still, the right edge  looks
bigger right now.]
(;B[ne];W[oe];B[pd];W[me]C[KHS : I though a long time about  this move. I could find no way white would not get a good result, or a good  fighting
position, if black pulled out.

KP : Yes, I don't think black can pull out.];B[md]C[KHS : But he didn't..]
;W[nf];B[nc];W[rk]C[YES!!];B[qj];W[qk];B[ac];W[bd]L[ej][lk]C[Remaining  moves not recorded.

in at the top. Also, very very nasty aji starting at `a' remains.

is more clear. All such white moves are now sente.];AW[qf]N[aji];AB[pf]

KP : There are many ways to continue from here, and what you choose depends  a bit on taste. You could settle in the corner with `a', taking sente, and  wait for a chance to invade later. Another possibility worth considering is
switching sides with `b' or tenuki. I don't know what is best here. The
variations shown are just two suggestions.]
