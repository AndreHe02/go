AB[pd][dp]C[Hello, I'm Julien Signoles, 5k in France (3k on KGS). I am going to comment your game by focusing on the main white's bad moves even if I also point out some other moves. But do not forget: I'm not a dan player ;-).

Main resume: you have to improve your game when attacking ennemy weak stones. Below are some highlights.
- get points when attacking
- look at the weakness of your opponent and attack it there, in particular when in play a bad move (e.g. an unjoseki move).
- when your opponent invades your moyo, play more agressively: it should not escape or live easily. The goal is not necessarily to kill it but to gain something into exchange.
- don't play too submissively, in particular when your opponent is supposed to be weaker than you like in an handicap game.

Also:
- in the openning, try to follow joseki more often: you should play joseki except in special cases.

Hope this helps!]PL[W];W[dd];B[qp];W[op];B[pn]
(;W[kq]C[This move is not joseki as far as I know. I usually plays a joseki beginning at R3 in this position (see first variation). Here a black move at P3 (see second variation) would give black a big corner and white would become overconcentrated.]

(;B[gq];W[qi];B[qf];W[ql];B[cf]TR[oq]C[P3 seems still to be the key point for black to be alive (and R3 for white).]
;W[fc];B[di]TR[dj]C[D10 is joseki (D11 is not sot standard, but playable I guess).]
;W[qq]C[Good!];B[rq];W[pq];B[rm]TR[ro]C[The black's joseki move is S5 to protect the cut and to provide eye shape.]

(;W[rl]C[Black did not follow joseki: so you have to exploit his mistake by playing at the vital point (see variations).]
;B[qm]
(;W[jd]TR[nc]SQ[fc]C[Seems bad. O17 seems better (see variations). A white pincer should be not good since white is already strong with F17. Furthermore playing on the fourth line is usually for getting influence but it seems useless here (no moyo is possible, no black stone to attack right now).]
;B[mc]TR[oc]C[P17 would take the corner for sure and would be better.]

(;W[dn]TR[ck]SQ[cn][cp]C[The 6-4 point is usually bad against a hoshi (except in special circumstance). The 6-3 point is more usual. C4 is also probably playable in this position but it is more complicated. But here, black top left group is not fully stable and you must take that into account by playing C9.]

(;B[cl]C[I would play C6. See variation.]
(;W[ep]TR[cq]C[The corner is still big and open: C3 seems to be better. See variations.]

C[This sequence seems to be bad for white: black consolidates all his position while you get an heavy group.]
;B[am];W[dk];B[ck]TR[cj]C[Bad! Should be at C10.];W[fj]C[White looks heavier than strong here. But even if you gain strongness you have nothing to attack except Q6 a little bit. So it is useless.

You have to create weaknesses in your opponent stones to have something to attack. In particular in handicap games.]
;B[dj];W[fl];B[ip]TR[iq]C[J3 would be better (takes point).]
;W[ko];B[kc];W[jc];B[kd];W[ke];B[le]
(;W[je]TR[lf]C[White is too submissive here. Double hane at M15 is better (see variations).]
;B[lf];W[qo]TR[rr]C[Here taking the corner at S2 looks much better. It also prevents blacks to get 2 eyes but it takes a lot of points.

Remember: take points while attacking.];B[ro];W[po];B[qn];W[ok]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[jr];W[jq];B[iq];W[kr];B[is]TR[rr]C[Bad move: Black should tenuki and takes sente. S2 looks like the bigger move: S5 would be fully alive and it takes a lot of points.]

;B[hh]TR[hi]C[Should be at H11.];W[ji]TR[ii]C[You are strong enough to play keima at J11: white couldn't cut and would die quickly.]
