C[agrajaj [8k\]: hi gg


Review request made by Benjamin (black).

Thank you in advance.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi Benjamin,
I'm Sven, your reviewer. I'm sorry, that the review took so long,
but I had a lot of work the last few weeks and in the evening I was too tired to make a good review.
So let's start.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Finally:

Hopefully you can learn something from my comments and alternatives. My explanations are a bit short, but I think I will show some interesting alternatives to think about and to inspire you.
(last comment on move 93)
Thanks for reading my thoughts about the game and I hope you gained something out of them!]
;B[pd]C[Well, I hope this is not wrong yet :)

Sven: As long as you don't play on the first and second line its all fine :)]
;W[dp]C[mokkunn [8k\]: hi];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[hc]C[I don't know the joseki here, so I improvise.

Sven: I don't know the joseki either XD
And unfortunately eidogo.com or josekipedia.com also don't know it really...
So I try to explain it in a more general way:

1. b-e16 blocks white way to the middle directly. But blacks way into the corner is also blocked by w-c16. So black wants influence and white could take the corner. Otherwise black would attack at e17 trying to get a bit of the corner....
2. The pincer at h17 is low, so white wants to have the top border and prevent black from linking up his e16 stone with the q16 one....

see next steps...];B[cc]LB[cc:3][hc:2][ed:1][df:C][ef:A][dg:C]
[pj:B][fq:B][jq:B]C[E16 being pinched, I try to make a base, right ?

Sven: That's one way... making a base. For beginners it is always good to think about that in the first place....

1. b-e16 blocks white way to the middle directly. But blacks way into the corner is also blocked by w-c16. So black wants influence and white could take the corner. Otherwise black would attack at e17 trying to get a bit of the corner....
2. The pincer at h17 is low, so white wants to have the top border and prevent black from linking up his e16 stone with the q16 one....

3. trying to make a base

Alternatives:

3a: Standard procedure: No one wants to get prisoned in the corner...so normally you jump out to the mid, similÃ¶ar you do on e17. There you would also jump out to e15. White now has to make a choice...if white defends the border with c14 you can stil attach with c17, but you have more helper stones in place.

3b: Just let it go, as it is. Since 1 can ruzn into the mid at every time, because both white stones are low, you can just leave it for now, waiting to see,  how you can make use of this stone.

3c: Attacking the white stone either with a small or large diagonal jump and providing a way out into the mid.

Personlly I would choose 3b, because white has just no good follow up. Probably he will also play tenuki and play elsewhere on the board]

6. Look at my alternatives! It's a bit dirty and I do not show all variations, but you can and you should fight....It's just very hard to figure it out!]

(;B[fd]LB[cc:3][dc:5][hc:2][dd:4][ed:1][fd:7][ee:6]C[I don't want to be shut in and I would like to isolate  H17. But now, i think that may be a huge mistake.

Sven: You think in the correct way! The problem is: It is probably too late to do it in a nice and proper way ewithout fighting!]
;W[fb]LB[eb:D][fb:8][cc:3][dc:5][hc:2][bd:C][dd:4][ed:1][fd:7]
[de:B][ee:6][fe:A]C[This is really annoying. He strenghten his stone and threat to cut.

Sven: Yeah but urgent things first! How can he cut with such a weak group on the left? So attacking first!

A-C

Or if you have to defend, try to have sente!
D

Look at the variations for each alternative!
A isn't good, but B and C are ok!
Always have in mind, that if white defends, you should also defend on D or e16. But with the attacking at first, you have more helper stones or you got just the corner or more potential for the future!]

(;B[fc]LB[eb:D]C[Bad shape

Sven: Oh yes, better D as mentioned in the last move or directly connect at e17.]
;W[df];B[hd]C[I really don't want to be shut in, but contact play with a weak stone was probably wrong.

Sven: Contact play is for defence, so it is not totally the wrong one here! But it expresses how bad the situation is for black!]
;W[eb]LB[gf:A]C[
Sven: Now this is a little high level...
Let's say: always think about the complications! And how stones work together!
Attacking at e18 is not the right move, when h17 is that weak! Your contact play forces white to defend and strengthen this stone!

So you can just ignore e18 for now and get you in a better position with A.
The Alternative shows, what happens if white cuts!

But as you will see: your contact play and the stone at A must be in place for punishing the cut!]

(;B[ec];W[ic];B[kc]C[Not a clever move. My left group is certainly not strong enough to support such an attack, it's not even alive yet.

Sven: Yes, you should break out into the mid at first! -> g14]
;W[jd];B[kd];W[je];B[ff]C[Running in the not-so-open

Sven: f14 is not that good! Better play calm and safe! f14 is a kind of contact play. but you get some bad shapes and white can easily strengthen his stones.
See Alternative]
(;W[ci];B[bd]C[I live. Overall, very disappointed by the result obtained in this corner.

Sven: Where do you live? The corner is one eye at most! (See Alternatives on move 31)]
;W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[db];W[gc];B[gd]C[Some of the Alternative need the "bent 4 in the corner"
If you don't know them:

(;W[jb];B[ke]C[Sven: 
Don't think its the correct play!

1. There are bigger moves on the board then that!
2. If you play something like that, better play l18 to defend territory!
3. In this way, you invite white to attack your left group!]
;W[kb]
(;B[fq];W[eq]C[Not a good choice i think

Sven: Well it's fine by white...];B[fp];W[dn];B[jp]
(;W[rd]LB[qf:A]C[I don't understand this

Sven: I also don't understand this by white...
Since white has l18 and all doors open to the upper right, white can easily just play at q14 or r14 and run into the corner if necessary or expand to the bottom.

(see variations one move before)];B[qc]C[Sven:
 But I also do not understand black...upper side isn't worth anymore, since white can easily invade at m18... so top is not worth anything now, r15 would be a better move! trying to make territory the right side down to bottom.]
;W[qg];B[pf];W[qj];B[qf]C[I felt somting could be done to punish White here but I failed

Sven: Well white is overextended. One cannot cut a two point jump, but two-two point jumps are too much, the middle stone can just keep one connection!
You've done the correct thing, but you had this reading mistake...

Alternatively, you could go for more influence!];W[rf]

C[At least White lives small and I have outer influence ...

Sven: yep, but it's a pitty, that black has no time now to defend the upper border at m18]
;W[sg];B[jf]C[... and I enlarge it];W[lc]C[Yep, I made tenuki before. Should I be upset with this ? I wasn't during the game, but maybe I'm giving too much ?

Sven: Point is: the whole upper black side is floating around! No black group in the upper half of the board has a secure area (base)! That cannot be good!]
;B[md];W[mq];B[oq];W[jr]C[Sven: You should directly ask what white wants! with L2 or J2

From this point on, my varations feels all a little bit bad, because blacks upper side is just to weak to support your botttom....]

(;B[jq];W[ir]C[Sven:
Well, also the outgoing alternative is not tht good...white can just run to bottom left or with n3 run to r10....]

(;B[lq];W[lr];B[lp];W[nr];B[or];W[os]
(;B[qm]C[How can this be wrong ? Nonetheless, i lost a lot here

Sven: well it's just like playing tenuki.
Your already in a fist fight! white wants to break into your corner.... defend it! (See variation on move 70!

;B[op];W[rq];B[qp];W[ph];B[oh];W[pj];B[oi];W[ok]LB[cl:C][bn:B]
[cq:A]C[I thought a long time here. White want to enter in the center. Understandable, Black could make a lot of point here with few moves. But I don't want to try to block him to make walls around the center because it's still very open and White should have no problem to reduce to a mere 20-30 points square, and I would be behind in territory with no means to come back.
I want to use my influence to help me invade the right side and lower his territorial lead. that seemed to be a better use of my outer walls

Sven: Yes you're right. That's analyzed correctly, but in my opinion it's too late at this point...whites lead in territory is just too massive right now. Black has already th upper left corner, but nothing more....

But well:
A can fight for the corner...standard pattern
B can run out with c as second move or get into the corner with A as second move
C isn't the right move, since white is safe on top and on bottom of that position. Whiote just let C run out into the mid

see Alternatives]
(;B[cq]
(;W[cp];B[er];W[nl]C[He doesn't care

Sven: Well as I mentioned before: white can do that because whites far in the lead at this point!]
;B[dq];W[dk]C[I thought that was a lame move, but he has such a lead he can allow himself to play such slow moves

Sven: And d9 is not slow, it secures the last big open area for white....]
;B[rk]C[Trying to find soft spots in white positions and build some territory too]
;W[rj];B[ep]C[By now I am in byo-yomi and my opponent still has 10 mins.
This move give me full control on the corner, but  may be too slow and doesn't answer the urgency of my position.

Sven:
This is the last comment I'm doing:
At this point, you realize, that you have no territory and try to find a way gaining something, but its too late... I have no hints in the further game, that can turn around the whole thing.

But I finally have one advice for you:

If you build influence, like you tried in this game, make sure, that your opponent is prisoned in the corners or at leats gets many problems trying to weaken your influence. Your influence in this game wasn't really there, because of groups without a base (like d17) or groups, that let the opponent still get into the mid (like o9).

look at the first 20 to 50 moves...your opponent is very low in placing his stones and your very high... Try to balance it more! Try to force your opponent to stand high on some points to gain a secure base!

And there are some big mistakes in the beginning, that made the game very hard and unpleasant for black!]
