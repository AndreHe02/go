C[Hello reviewer,
Thanks for your help
I played black and had some question mostly during opening and middle game?

Alex: I hope my comments are helpful!  The most important lesson from the opening is to avoid making weak groups.  I think also you would benefit from looking carefully at the endgame.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pp];B[eq];W[cj];B[oc];W[qj]C[Alex: It's an unusual opening pattern, but I think it's good for black.]
;B[fc];W[fd];B[gd];W[ed]C[Never seen this. How to response

Alex: I've never seen it either!  I would respond at G15.]
(;B[ec]C[is this ok?

Alex: It's OK, but it makes it easy for white to build a moyo on the left.]
;W[ge];B[hd]
(;W[dc]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by white: H15 would be better.]
;B[he]C[Alex: Good move.];W[gf]
(;B[di]C[how about this move

Alex: I think this is bad.  It makes a weak group, so that white has a chance to attack.

If you want to play in this area, E10 is a better move.  But I think this isn't urgent: R12 would be even better.]
;W[ci];B[dh];W[cg];B[dg];W[cf];B[gi];W[hf];B[ef]C[Alex: This is aji-keshi: later on you might prefer to make a different move in this area.  Just play K15 right away.]
;W[ee];B[ff];W[fe]C[Alex: This is a difficult position for black.  You'd like to play J14 and double hane (see variation to next move), but it would hurt your group below.  That's why the shoulder hit (D11) doesn't work well.]

(;B[je]C[Alex: I guess this is the best possible move here.]
;W[md];B[oe]C[Alex: This looks too soft, but it's hard to find a better way to attack.  L17 instead would be overconcentrated.  Maybe N14? but it looks a little crazy.]
;W[mf]
(;B[if]C[Alex: Again, this has a bad effect on your G11 group.  Maybe you could try M15 instead?  (variation)]
;W[hh]
(;B[gh]C[Alex: I think J13 is better (variation)];W[ig];B[jg]
;W[jh];B[kg];W[mh];B[kh];W[jc]
(;B[le]C[Alex: Good idea, but I think K11 should come first.]
;W[me];B[lc]C[The following got complicated and I think I messed up

Alex: Yes, it is complicated!  I think M17 is a good move.  You need to keep a sense of perspective here: K17 should be captured, but you can't expect to capture the N16 group now.  I think your mistakes came from trying too hard.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[nc]
(;B[nb]C[Alex: I think this works, but I'm not totally sure.  If it doesn't work, then L17 is a safer move (variation).]
;W[mb];B[mc];W[nd]
(;B[ob];W[gc]C[Should I just give up the E17and F17 like in the variation?

Alex: I don't think so, because I don't think white's "tesuji" at J16 actually works...]

(;B[gb];W[id]
(;B[ic]C[Alex: Can't black play J15 instead?  I'm not totally sure, but it looks OK to me.  See the variation.]
;W[kc];B[lb];W[kb];B[ma];W[jd];B[ie];W[ke];B[ji]C[Alex: Good move.]
;W[ih]
(;B[gg]C[Alex: This isn't so good.  It's aji-keshi again: it makes it harder for black to connect up with J11 (see variation).]
;W[hg];B[kj]C[Alex: This looks like a nice shape, but there is still some bad aji here: white could cut by playing H10 (see variation to next move).]

(;W[kf];B[jf];W[og]C[how about next move?

Alex: Your move looks fine to me.];B[jp];W[nq]
(;B[pk]C[Should I just invade to like S4 now or build moyo somewhere like c7?

Alex: I think this move is a mistake: white should reply at R9 and take territory.

I think S4 is a good invasion.  C7 is the wrong point for building a moyo (too low), but D8 looks OK to me.  It's hard to say which is better out of S4 or D8.]
;W[od];B[pd]
(;W[qf]C[Alex: This is a mistake by white.  It's a very small move; you should ignore it and play at R6 next.]

(;B[pf];W[pg];B[qg]C[Alex: Instead, R6 is still good.];W[qh]
C[mistake! no needed];B[rg];W[rf];B[rh];W[ri];B[re];W[sg]
(;B[qp]C[Alex: This is an interesting move! but it seems to turn out badly... maybe R6 or S5 was better.]
;W[qo];B[ro];W[qq];B[rp];W[qn];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[ql]
(;B[rq]C[Alex: I think R2 instead gives you a bigger corner (see variation).]
;W[qr];B[rr];W[rs];B[sr];W[rl];B[sm]C[This lives pretty hard what instead should go?

Alex: Go back and look at the earlier comments!];W[dj];B[cm]
C[Alex: I think E10 is a better move here: you still need to defend your weak stones!  See the variation to the next move.]

(;W[hq]C[HOw to response?

Alex: J3: make white heavy and attack.  See variation to the next move.

White could have played H10 instead (variation).]
(;B[go];W[ho]
(;B[km]C[Alex: This leaves bad aji behind: you should respond to white's contact move at H5.  It's hard to say what's best: H4 or G4 or H6 (variations).]
;W[hm]
(;B[mq]C[Alex: Again, I think you should answer white's move.  G6 looks good here.]
;W[mp];B[lq];W[gn];B[ej];W[dl];B[gk]C[Alex: Notice how the weak black group is the focus of the whole game!]
;W[dm]
(;B[dn]C[Alex: C6 is a stronger shape (variation)];W[en];B[do]
;W[fp]C[Alex: It still looks like a close game.];B[bl];W[bk]
;B[lp];W[mo];B[nr];W[oq]
(;B[mk]C[Alex: This is gote, and quite small.  See the variation.]
