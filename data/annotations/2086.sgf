C[Hi,
my name is Rainer and I am 21k at IGS at the moment. I played black in this
game. Please identify my greatest errors and give me hints for doing better
in the future. Thank you very much.

rika:
Hi,
I'm Chun-Kit (12k IGS, 8k KGS, 9k DE). I tried to figure out some of the problems of your play/-ing style. Please be aware that all reviewer will give you different hints and opinions to the same game.
I have spent most of the reviewing time in the first quarter of the match, since the opening is very important how the match will be developed. That's why professionals uses most of their allowed thinking time in the opening. Mistakes in the opening and you will have to face a difficult match.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]
(;B[nq]C[rika:
This move is ok. Black want the down part, White will get the right (if White continues here)
Personally (as a territory-style player) I would go for the final corner (see var)]
;W[dd];B[qm]TR[qq]C[rika:  since White doesn't answer to O3 (normal: wR3) attacking is a good idea.]
;W[no]
(;B[lp]C[rika:  here R4 will do a nice job, keeping white away from the corner (see var)]
;W[qp];B[qq]MA[qm]C[rika:  ok, if saving the corner is important to you. As you can see white's next move, he pincers your weak stone R7.]
;W[qj];B[qn]SQ[om]MA[no][po][qp]C[rika:  questionable move, because it's too slow.
you force white's 3 stones to make it stronger, but your 2 stones could be capped, therefore you have to make 2 eyes for life.
safer jump into the center since the 3 white stones has no eye]
;W[rp];B[rk]C[rika:
playing the second line is not good.
white can keep you low while he can build influence to the outside (center)
remember:  4th line: line of power
3rd line: line of territory
2nd line: line of safety (last hope for living in my eyes)]

(;W[qg]C[rika:
my first instinct says S10 or R9 (even P8 is good) for white]

(;B[rj]LB[qk:A]C[Instead I should have played at A

rika:
sure, crawling the second line was never advantageous in the early stage of the game
let's see what happens if bR9 (var)];W[qk];B[om]TR[on]C[rika:
for me P6 (peep) looks better, since black have no worries to live on the right side]
;W[mn];B[kn];W[oo];B[mm]MA[kn][lp][mm][nq][om]C[rika:
ok, you're going to kill the whole 6 stones.
but you must be aware that keima stones have weakness to be cutted]

(;W[nm];B[nl];W[nn];B[ml];W[rq];B[rr];W[sr];B[qr];W[rn]
(;B[qo]C[rika:
of course playing R8 yourself will kill the whole white stones in the corner]
;W[ro]
(;B[pp]C[rika:
result: you will capture the 6 surrounding stones, but I'm sure you want more...]
;W[ql]C[Now the two stones are lost...];B[rm];W[rl];B[pl]C[...and I have to rescue my other group]
;W[sm];B[pj];W[qi];B[ph]SQ[qi][qj][qk][ql]MA[ph][pj][pl]C[rika:
the lower right side is settled. I think it's time to switch side, since playing there isn't big anymore
btw: beware the three X-marked stones are separated each against the solid connected white square stones. A combo of ataris will be the result.  And white made an approach with R13 against R16, white can ignore your last move and can hit hard with P17.]

(;W[pi];B[oi]
(;W[pg];B[og];W[pe];B[ne];W[jc]C[rika:
white took a big move now. It's time to for you to realize that you must make a big move too.]
;B[qh];W[rh];B[oh]
(;W[ri]C[rika:
unfortunately he saw a big snapback (or was it instinct?)];B[nc]
SQ[cf][cj][cn][df][dj][dn][fq]C[rika:
my opinion: much bigger the squared intersections.];W[gq]
(;B[iq]C[rika:
answering every move of your opponent is just what he wants
interesting is first exchange C14 for the corner and come back to J3]
;W[cj]C[rika:
let's have a look at the whole board situation:
black stones are all on the right side of the board, while white has occupied all strategical points on the left. Now you have to face a handicap 9 situation (not quite because K17 and C10 are next to the starpoints). Therefore you have to fight in the left side of the board while white can calmly attack you and make territory]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[bm]SQ[dm]C[rika:
again 2nd line is not good, better D7 for the fourth line];W[bn]

(;B[oj]C[Here I made a big mistake, I should have left the stone and defended futher away like shown in the variation

rika:
yes, better option: P9];W[ok];B[ol];W[nk]
(;B[mj]C[I think the variation would have been much better

rika:  not quite. if you want to stop him to get into the center you must defend it much farther away, since the white stones which are diving into the center are already alive.]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[lj]
(;B[li]TR[kk][ll][nj]C[Am I right, that one of the marked positions would have been better?

rika:
depending what you want. securing the lower part L9 is enough. O10 can be difficult if wP14]
;W[ll];B[lm]C[Have to save the two groups];W[kk];B[ki];W[gm]
;B[gl];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[gk];W[ho];B[io];W[jm]
(;B[jn]C[I could have evoided the snapback

rika:
yes];W[km];B[ln];W[in];B[ip];W[cc]C[rika:
he secures the upper left corner, hard to say when black was able to play there himself]
;B[gi]LB[dg:A][gd:B]C[I think this is too small. Somewhere around A or B would have been better...

rika:
right, if you have decided to jump from a living group, it could be much deeper
A or B: better B because white has 2 stones at C10/D10, while there is only one at K17]
;W[eh];B[gg]C[Still too small, I think.];W[je];B[kg]SQ[ge]C[rika:  much bigger going into white territory, because you just defended about 10 pts. (if I counted right), white with G15 are worth about 20pts.
If he answers your G15, continue to destroy to the left and you can come back to secure your center]

(;B[md]SQ[bj][en][he][hr]C[rika:
I don't think that's necessary, better grap something away from opponent's territory (squared marks)
Invasion at this point of the game shouldn't work right now]
;W[hf];B[ig];W[hr];B[ir];W[bk];B[dk];W[am];B[od]SQ[ei][en][fg]
[gf][hq]C[rika:
you are making points now or afraid to be cutted? of course you have to look for answered moves like the squared marks (sente, forcing moves)]

only worth 1 point, better the marks];W[hg];B[hh];W[gf];B[cq]
C[Looked like a good idea at the time

rika:
it's ok in the 20k range to try that, but it won't work - as you found it in your variations yourself - with a wall at the 6th line and some helping stones at G3]

;W[ss];B[on]C[rika:  wasted move #2];W[oq];B[or];W[op];B[mo]
MA[aj]C[rika:
3th wasted move, without the 3 stones the score would be 3 points better than it was.

I assume this is the end of the record. You are playing in IGS, so A10 is still one point for white, since the IGS-Server can't judge false eyes as no points.

Looking at the final position of the board: It could have been much worse if the upper left group wasn't alive. The lower left seems to be untouched, just because there was no exchange in the lower left corner (white played first with G3)

So what should you learn from this match:
- Look at the whole board situation from time to time. After 55 moves you were too concentrated on the one side of the board
- if the groups are settled locally play tenuki (elsewhere), especially in the beginning of the match
- avoid 2nd line while the side isn't settled. Crawling the 2nd line will gain you only one point at the first line.
- try to stay calm if a stone is in atari (as you have informed my it was 1/10 IGS) and don't try to save every stone on the board. Players at your range should be able to read 4-6 stones in a local area ahead (I know every 1-1 game like Chess, Go, even Tic Tac Toe have to be played out in the brain)
- for a balanced match play every of your opponent's corner out in the first 20 moves. Then you shouldn't have to deal with a handicap 9 like situation after 60 moves. Just remind you the 50 first moves where at the side where black played the first 2 corners, while the 2 white stones at the corner were nearly untouched. And you cannot afford it in a 5.5/6.5-komi game.
- 1 space jump (ikkentobi) is too slow/small from a living group and have to be watched if cut is possible

I hope this review will help you in the future games
