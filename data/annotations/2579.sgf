C[S> This is Eric Piotrowski, aka Scartol on IGS and KGS and Sensei's Library. My comments all have this S> symbol in front of them.
--
S> You've got a good solid style, but your opponent did a good job of pushing you around a bit. Hopefully, I can show you some ways to be more assertive.
--
S> Shameless plug: Check out my 3D Go art at www.just-text.org/artofgo/]
;B[pc]LB[pd:A][pk:C][pq:B]C[EVS - I'm always opening 3-4 for consistancy.  (But maybe I should be using 4-4, because in handicap games I really don't know what to do in the corners.) I didn't get any real ko's in this game, if you can point out place where I could have set them up, I would apreciate it.  I think that I generally do well in ko fights against others at my level.
--
S> Knowing how to fight ko is great -- vitally important. But don't use that as a basis for your whole game (this first comment kinda leads me in that direction). 
--
S> This opening is fine, provided you can follow it up well. I recommend picking an opening that works for you -- many beginners like the nirensei opening (two hoshi points on the same side of the board) or the Chinese Fuseki (A, B, and C here). If you start with a solid opening each time, you can work out some variations and become skilled at handling different appraoches. The more you fiddle with your first moves, the harder it is to adapt to changing circumstances.]
;W[dp];B[cd];W[pp];B[ec]LB[dj:A]C[EVS - I want to safely get a corner
--
S> Good. Now A is a perfect spot for black, but of course, white gets it first.]
;W[dj];B[qe]C[EVS - Second corner.  Too conservative?
--
S> It's hard to say for sure -- white stretches herself out pretty thin with the next move...]
;W[pj]LB[jd:A]C[S> ... but she has covered more of the board. I say the only way to judge if this is too conservative or not is to look at a series of games. If you lose many games because you lose corners, then focus on making those solid. If you tend to lose on territory, work on making more of it. If your opponents attack you and cut you apart, work on staying connected. 
--
S> Looking at this one game, I'd say that you're able to get into white's frameworks pretty well, so making these solid corners early is fine. However, A is very common instead of R15.]
;B[jd]C[EVS - I don't know if this should be on the 3 or 4 line
--
S> It depends on what you want. Territory = 3rd line. Outside influence = 4th line. This move makes black very solid on top.]
;W[gd]
(;B[hc]C[S> This is too passive. It's basically asking for white to split black apart. See variation.]
;W[gc];B[hd]C[S> There's nothing necessarily wrong with this move, but having only one space between a two space wall and its extension stone is really small at this point of the game (later on, when you secure your connections, it's good). The white stones are now definitely not much of a threat, so instead of further protecting yourself, you should take sente and seize one of the bigger points on the board.]
;W[he]
(;B[id]C[S> This is very passive. See variation.];W[gb]LB[dg:C]
[jq:A][nq:B]C[EVS - Should I respond to this sequence? or tenuki?
--
S> As always, it's a matter of priorities. If you want to make your top groups all nice and sealed, respond. If you tenuki, you run the risk that white will unexpectedly jump into one of these territories. But if you respond, then white might seal up her own territory, and make it harder for you to get in. I personally would tenuki at A, B, or C.]
;B[hb];W[ha];B[ia];W[ga];B[jb];W[ie]
(;B[me]C[EVS - Creating large moyo to bridge groups?];W[ee]
;B[cf];W[dd];B[dc];W[cg];B[de]C[EVS - protecting corner];W[df]
;B[ed];W[fe];B[gq]LB[fq:A][jq:B]TR[cg][dj][pj][pp]C[EVS - Setup to invade at c3
--
S> Good. A is a more common way to approach the corner (it puts a little more pressure on D4). If you want to live quickly, B is another good way to deal with this. If you move into the corner, white can press you down and make a big, biug center moyo with the marked stones (and she chose influence on the top right, so she's happy to do this), and getting into that will be tricky. 
--
S> What B does is force white to make a decision -- approach from the left or the right? If from the right, you extend two spaces to the left, and vice versa.]
;W[gp]
(;B[hq]C[EVS - I did not expect such an agressive response, I wish I could do more with it.
--
S> Yeah, it's very assertive of white. See variations for possible alternatives.]
;W[jq]
(;B[eq]C[S> This is a small jump. H3 isn't a bad move, but it's thick and slow -- you need to make the next move more aggressive. See variation.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eo];B[fo]LB[fp:A]C[S> This does nothing but give white a free prisoner. A is obviously better.]
;W[fp];B[fq];W[go];B[fn];W[do];B[ip]C[EVS - escape toward center]
;W[jo]
(;B[in]C[S> Here you make a hole for white to plow right through. See variation.]
;W[io];B[ho];W[hn]C[S> However, at this point, there's still a clever tesuji to watch for (since white didn't see it, you should!).. See variation.]

(;B[hp];W[gn];B[fm]C[S> You should let these stones go. They're only going to live if white makes a series of mistakes (which, of course, she does). It's a bad idea to get into the habit of thinking "If only my opponent doesn't..." Instead, develop plans with nearly-as-good backup plans, so you're safe either way. It takes longer, but you'll do better.]
;W[hm];B[jm];W[jp];B[jj]C[EVS - I want to trap W-j7 group
--
S> Probably a vain wish, and dangerous besides. What you'll end up with is two weak groups, and meanwhile white will make a lot of profit. The proverb says: "It's easy to live, hard to kill." Killing groups is fun, but it's not a good basis for your entire game. Live first, attack later.]
;W[hk];B[dm]C[EVS - but not let my f7 group get trapped];W[cn]
;B[cm];W[bm];B[bl];W[am];B[al];W[bo];B[ck]C[EVS- looking to forms some eyes, i don't see a lot of space
--
S> Yes, black only lives here because white gets sloppy.];W[cj]
;B[bj];W[bi];B[aj]
(;W[ai]C[S> This white move is unnecessary. See variation.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[el];W[fk];B[nq]C[EVS - prepare to invade at r3]
;W[oq];B[qq]C[EVS- This time i decided to ignore his aggressive response to o3, and go for some of the corner, maybe o3 will help]
;W[qp]
(;B[pq]C[S> There's a more common way to use this arrangement of stones. See variation.]

(;W[op]C[S> This is silly of white. See variation.];B[or];W[rq]
C[EVS - In retrospect it was obvious that this would happen, now I'm not sure what to do.
--
S> No big worries; see variation for how to live in the corner.]

(;B[ps]C[EVS - Will this help?
--
S> It's passive and timid. See variation for a stronger method.]
;W[qr];B[pr]C[EVS - Ouch, why did I do this, W should take this group
--
S> I don't see how she can. If white doesn't save R2, black can take it and use it to make life.]
;W[rr]C[EVS - Thankfully, he makes mistakes too]
(;B[nr]C[EVS - Now I will need to escape or get some eyes
--
S> The tiger's mouth is certainly better here. See variations.]
;W[np];B[lq]C[EVS - maybe either?];W[lp];B[jr]C[EVS - Maybe I can bridge to this other weak group, or maybe this will help make some eyes]
;W[kr];B[kq];W[ir]C[EVS - I should have seen this coming as well]
;B[lr]C[EVS - At least I think I can make two eyes for the lower right group]
;W[js];B[ls]C[S> If white plays her cards right, this black shape is dead. Black only lives here because white attacks in the improper place. The tiger's mouth was the necessary step to live.]

(;W[ms]C[S> This is the wrong way for white to attack. See variation.]
;B[ns];W[mq];B[mr]C[EVS - Not exactly a satisfying victory, he is very strong on line 4
--
S> And black only lives because of white's slip. Skill before luck every time.]
;W[mp];B[ph]C[S> A very nice move.];W[mj];B[kh]C[EVS - I would like to get some of the center, if only by connecting from the upper right
--
S> Not bad.];W[lg];B[kg]C[S> Good response.];W[kf];B[lf]C[EVS - "Cut first, think later"
--
S> Yes, this crosscut is good. But think first if you have time; map out some possibilities and you'll be more prepared when they arrive.]
;W[jf];B[mh]C[EVS - This looks good to me.];W[mf]
(;B[mg]C[EVS - I decided to sacrifice m14 to get stronger in the center
--
S> You shouldn't have to. This allows white to run up into your top area. See variation.]
;W[le];B[nf];W[lf];B[lh];W[ne];B[md];W[ng];B[of];W[nh];B[ni]
;W[mi];B[oi]C[S> Good.];W[nj];B[ld]C[EVS - Securing the top
--
S> Also good.];W[kd];B[kc];W[ke]
(;B[hj]C[EVS - trying to live in the center
--
S> Don't play so closely. See variation for a better method.]
;W[ki];B[li];W[ji];B[lj];W[kj];B[lk];W[kk];B[ll]C[EVS - likely sacrificing the center to form something on the right-center
--
S> Risky, but perhaps it's your only choice.];W[kl];B[km];W[lm]

(;B[ml]C[S> This is slow, and speed is of the essence. See variation.]
;W[mm];B[nl];W[om];B[oj];W[nm];B[ol];W[pl];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk]
;W[pi];B[oh]C[EVS - Looking back at it, I think I should have done r11 instead
--
S> Yes, this move is unnecessary.];W[qi]
(;B[ri];W[qh];B[qg];W[rh];B[ql];W[qm];B[rm]C[EVS - Is it hopeless to try to make life here?
--
S> Yes. Better to play as in the variation (to protect the top quickly) or -- better yet -- do something about that group at the bottom left with no eyes!]
;W[rn];B[rg];W[si];B[rk];W[rj]C[EVS - Yes, hopeless.];B[od]
C[EVS - Securing upper right against an invasion
--
S> This is less of a concern than the group at bottom.];W[qn]
;B[ko]C[EVS - This is a waste of a play on my part, but has sente, right?
--
S> You had sente before, and this move is the same thing as passing -- it does nothing except help white solidify her wall.]
;W[kp];B[hr]C[EVS - looking for life for this group
--
S> Yes, very late in the game.]
(;W[jn]C[S> A waste of a white move when white shouldn't be wasting any. See variation for a better white method.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[ds];W[cq];B[fr];W[es];B[er];W[cs];B[fs]C[EVS - success!
--
S> ...because white made several mistakes. Don't depend on this -- make life earlier!]
;W[gs];B[hs];W[is]
(;B[bf]C[EVS - I was looking for a good way to extend the upper left, but couldn't find one, I decided to go for security.  What should I hve done.  It is probably too late now.
--
S> No, this is good. See variation for what happens if black doesn't make this thick wall.]
;W[jh];B[jg]C[EVS - I only responded here becuase the W l16 group is so close to atari.  I'm hoping that will be useful in the end game.
--
S> It's not a bad idea to push here on general principle -- white is clearly worried about the black group coming out. And you're quite right to use atari when you have it (it's called aji).]
;W[ig];B[ok];W[sg];B[sf];W[se];B[sh];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[qc]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[sg];B[rf]C[S> Very nicely played. Calm, solid. Well done.]

(;B[fb]C[EVS - I don't know how to secure this area
--
S> This feels desperate and silly. See variation.];W[fc];B[db]
;W[fa];B[da];W[fl];B[em]LB[dg:A]C[S> Not necessary. Cut at A already!]
;W[gm];B[dg]C[EVS - I am inspired, I see a cut that puts d14 in atari, and then if W saves it, I can take b13 group, or even a12 group.
--
S> Yes, definitely! Nice one!];W[ef];B[ch];W[dh]
(;B[bh]C[S> Nice. The variation is another way (which is equal to what you do here -- but the variation is useful in some other instances, when white has more solidity in the surrounding area.]
;W[eg];B[ci]C[S> Also nice.
