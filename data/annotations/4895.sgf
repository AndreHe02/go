C[g4: Dear reviewer.

This is a game I recently played in a team tournament in Germany.
I played black in this game.
In Germany I play as a 1k, my opponent is a 3d. But I tried my very best.
I felt good in the beginning of the middle game. But then I lost one of my groups.
Was this misinterpretation of the position, or was it only because of misreading in the middle game?

I think the position was indeed promising, but I will still like to point out several inaccuracies in the earlier play. The difference in level is quite apparent in the technique of the two players, but the white player seems to give very little thought to the global situation. This is typical of a stronger player who's just counting on his superior technique to win the game for him.]

;B[mo]C[this move is not good. it does not cover the cutting point completelty, and develops very slowly. it doesn't make the Q5 cut a reality either. I think the only choice for black is to play R3, but it you don't have the courage, a move like L4 would at least have some faster development.]
;W[qq]C[now W has territory, safety, and can look forward to moves like N3 to attack B.]

;W[je];B[ie];W[ke];B[ig];W[hc];B[ek];W[fk];B[lg]C[playing the push and then tenuki is strange. Better play M13 directly if you're not going to follow up on the push.]
;W[fl];B[em];W[fq]C[I think playing 3-3 or C4 is preferable... the lower side is almost impossible to make territory for black because of the shape problems at N3, so white should not be afraid to enter the corner.]

(;B[hq]C[because of this, the pincer is not appropriate here, B should secure the corner territory instead.]

;W[qn]C[g4: Up to here I felt ok. I counted only roughly, and I though I am a little ahead.
Now I cut in the center to use my influence. That should give me an easy win.
I thought.

I think you're doing OK - W's invasion in the upper right was not that good. the main problem for you are weak spots on the lower side. If you can cover them during the fight in the center, you can win. I think you lose the game because you feel you have to kill the W center stones. your aim should not be to kill, but to protect the lower territory.]
;B[fj];W[dj];B[cj];W[fh];B[gj];W[hl]C[this is heavy play by W. If he enters the lower side, it will be more difficult for B to decide how to proceed.]
;B[ij];W[jl];B[im];W[il]
(;B[mm]C[this move is not exactly bad, but I feel it shows your intentions are wrong... just playing L6 is appealing because it secures the territory while attacking. When you play like N7, you will have to come back to L6 later if you want the lower side to become your territory. actually that represents a whole move invested in the attack without directly making points.]
;W[kn]C[this white move is a bit surprising, like he's playing just by looking at the shapes without reading...]
;B[jo];W[kk];B[mk]C[... again you play a dame point to attack]

C[g4: And now the game is over.
I tried to pull something off but that could hardly work.
I would had given up now, if it hadn't been a team fight.];B[ff]
