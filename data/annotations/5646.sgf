C[Dear reviewer,
I play Black in this game.
I found some mistakes,
but I suppose I made some more.
I added some questions.

Thanks for your time.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[hc];B[cc]

;W[nr];B[mo];W[oj];B[ph]LB[pi:B][pj:A]C[mite> So far you've played solidly and according to josekis, so I assume this is your style. A and B are more aggressive alternatives I might play, but all good so far.]
;W[on];B[ol];W[nn];B[np]LB[qm:A]C[mite> O4 isn't important, because you could secure your group and territory with a play around R7, and if N5 gets disconnected it has plenty of room to live on the bottom side.]

(;B[dl];W[iq]C[mite> I agree with white here, this could have been a better move for you, because if white were to play around C9 after your J3, you still have lots of space to run away and on the way white gets two weakish groups. But definitely not bad.]
;B[eg];W[fe];B[me]LB[qb:B][he:A][ne:a][mi:C][io:D]C[better 'a' ?

mite> While 'a' would be connected, neither of these moves accomplishes much. What I often keep saying to anyone I give a lesson to is, "remember what your aim is". This is a difficult move though, since all the biggest ones seem to have been played out already. But yes, locally 'a' looks better (capping that O17 and all).

I took the right to place a few other interesting spots on the first glance. Some of them might not be best played right now.]

(;B[mg]C[mite> You are playing to the wrong direction now. You don't need to let go of N15, and shouldn't, either, because it provides great reducing possibilities. If you play this way, the only possible benefit I see is making white O9 vulnerable, but it's probably not worth it at this moment.]
