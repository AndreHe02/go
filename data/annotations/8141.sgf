C[Hi, thanks for the reviewing this game!
I've flagged the moves I flagged from reviewing myself; in general, I think I failed to strengthen myself whilst attacking my opponent's weaker groups.

B: Hello. I'm Biondy (1 dan) I'll start my review with B];B[qd]

(;B[jp]C[This move proved very difficult for me - I want to play near Q13 after Q10, but white's follow-ups (r12, or o10) looked set to create a huge moyo. There was also the top right hand corner, which didn't feel settled - should I have punished white's tenuki?
With this move, I wanted to stop white k4 - looking back, I think it was a mistake

B: I personally think this move is strange... Usually K3 is the usual place for this invasion.]
;W[oc];B[pc]CR[kc]C[B: This move is correct due to the marked stone. Good move.]
;W[od];B[qg]C[Overplay - as proved by white's response

C[I'm not sure why white played this?

B: It's sente in endgame, but... I think you can ignore this move for now]

;B[ig];W[co]C[B: Nice moves by black. The white stones are still weak..]
;B[om]C[Bad move, I should've played e7, I think?

B: E7 is fine.. but I think this move has its own potential....]

(;B[on];W[ml]
(;B[mn]C[B: I think this is wrong place to start an attack.. And perhaps the losing move.]

;W[hi];B[ii];W[ij];B[ji];W[bf];B[jf];W[me];B[ko];W[kn];B[jn]
;W[ho]LB[ni:A][ij:B]C[B: The game is over. Too bad black can't cut due to the stone at B.

I personally think black should pay attention more in the opening. I think you should learn the opening from pro games (just see the first 20 moves or so and learn the usual moves at the opening) so you can improve your opening.

Also I think you should learn about attacking as well. Black has a nice influence in this game, but didn't use it well to fight. Perhaps you should look for "Get Strong at Attacking" to get more feel about aiming weak stones. 

I think these two are the issue from this game, but overall you're playing well. Keep up the good work.
