C[*I won this game, but I wasn't at all sure about it until the end.  I think I came out behind after fuseki.  The opening is my biggest problem I think, so if you could please comment on how I might improve it, I would be very thankful.  Thanks.*
Circlesoft-


  My name is Barry and I am rated about 10k on KGS.  I will try and focus on the opening for you.  Please keep in mind that my suggestions and comments may help in some ways, but the advice is only as good as my rank...  I will mark my commnets with  *.

*One of the best pieces of general advice I can offer is from a book I recently read.  The book Five Hundred and One Opening Problems gives the following general questions you should answer when deciding your move in the opening stages of a game..

1.  Is there an urgent move?
     a.  One that makes a base for your stone.
     b.  One that takes away the base of your opponent's stones.
     c.   One that takes the initiative in a certain area.

2.  Is there a big move? 
    a.  One that extends from your own position.
    b.  One that prevents an extension by your opponent.
    c.  One that threatens an invasion.
    d.  One that prevents an invasion.

3.   Is there a big moyo?
    a.  Do you need to expand or close off your moyo?
    b.  Do you need to erase or invade your opponents moyo?


and remember the motto: "Play urgent points before big points."]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[cd];W[pp];B[eq];W[dq]C[* white's move at d3 is not generally done unless white has support in the area of h-k 3 or 4]
;B[gp]C[* Not that this is a better move, but I would have responded with e4, because I would not let white want to occupy that spot.  It would give hime a great shape and sente. see var.]

(;W[lq]C[* White would have been better off moving at e4 first.  It is sente and makes good shape.  Black can still settle itself with k3.]

;W[ql];B[qp];W[qq];B[rp];W[rm];B[rq];W[qr];B[jq];W[cl]C[* If I was white I would have thought about attacking the group on the lowere right.  I think white might have build up some influence while keeping you on the run...]
;B[cn]C[sdieselil [19k?\]: ahh, i mean "hi" :-)

I realized this was quite the poor move right after I played it.  I wanted to stop white from connecting his corner group to C8, but obviously this move didn't work.  Would something like D6 have been better, or should I have played elsewhere and made more territory?

* D6 would not have been better.  Don't worry too much about your opponent gettting a little terrritory.]
;W[dn];B[do];W[co]
(;B[en]C[* If you were trying to seperate the groups d7 would have been better, but even if seperated white's group along c8 could have extended up and been safe.]
;W[dm];B[ep];W[di];B[cg]C[*Not a very good exchange for black, white got a lot of territory and still has influence in the middle.]
;W[jd];B[fc]C[* I like this shape.  It could  probably be invaded by a strong player, but it seems to have good potential.]
;W[gc];B[nc]C[* g16 before this move.  While this move makes good shape, it is not urgent.  Further white does not have to respond directly to this move.]
;W[lc];B[on];W[no];B[ol];W[oi];B[ll]C[I think a one-space jump might have been better here?  It seems like this might be too easy for white to cut apart.

* This is a good extension.  Since white is not strong close by I don't think this invites any problems for black at this time.]

(;W[og];B[pf];W[rh];B[jl];W[ln];B[mm]C[*I played this to ensure that M8 could connect to P8*]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ch];B[mn];W[mo]
(;B[lm]C[*hmmm.... I believe that you did this to solidify your connection and possible attack white's stone at m6... but are there other ways to threaten the attack and gain more benefit at the same time?

 Your connection at this point was already solid and could not be broken.  How about at L6, threatening to cut. see var.]
;W[kn];B[hl];W[fl];B[gn];W[io];B[ip];W[kp];B[rr]C[I played this because I thought white's R2 group would be endangered if white didn't respond.

* A good move, but sometmes it is best to save these threats until a ko fight starts. You would have not lost much if you had allowed white to move first in this area.  I believe there are moer urgetn points to play.  Perhaps g16?

;W[ps];B[nr];W[rs];B[mq]
(;W[mr];B[ns]C[This set up a ko for the life of the group at Q2.  Would there have been a way to kill the Q2 group without ko?  I seem to be very weak at ko fights.

* I don't believe you could have captured this group without a ko fight.  But you have nothing to lose.  I'm not very strong a ko fights either.  There is much preparation, setting up  stones for later use and not filling in threats that would be available for later.]
;W[nq];B[bo];W[bn];B[mq];W[lo]C[Didn't seem like any type of threat, so I played O3.

*  A good solid way to play.  If you wanted to gamble a little you could have moved at L3 and threatened to kill both groups.  White sae this and decided to cut his losses. You still had a good ko threat at b4.]

(;W[hj];B[ik];W[mj];B[lj];W[mh];B[jn]C[Trying to kill all the white stones in the L4 area.  This didn't work, is there any way to kill those stones?

*Nope];W[jm];B[jo]C[
You both played fairly conservatively at this point  and white tried no more tricks in order to make up the difference in the lost group.  You played a very nice endgame and collected a nice win.  

Overall you played very well.  Remeber to try to evaluate the whole board with each move.  Don't respond to an attack against one stone if there is a bigger move.  Also, try to make you opening moves do double duty.  Attacke and create territory at the same time( while trying to keep sente).  Its not always possible but it helps to think about it.

Good job.  If yuo have additional questions  or other games you would like for me to review please feel free to contact me at bconwil@aol.com.   Make sure you put something about go in the subject line to ensure that I don't delete it as spam.
