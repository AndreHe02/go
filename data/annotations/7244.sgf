AB[pd][dp]C[[Flamer: Hi!
This was a handicap game i played recently, and I thought it was a pretty good demonstration of my skill.  The game follows most of my normal style of play, so it isn't too odd of a game.  Any comments would be largely appreciated\]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me; Hello I'm Kichiro on KGS and I'll review your game. I will start all my comments with Me; out of a lack of creative energy. I apologize for this and hope it doesn't get in the way of the review.

I hope it's helpful and wish you the best of luck in further go playing.]

(;B[fp]C[I was hesitant about this move; is it too small and better at G3 or G4 or is that how it should be played?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: It's better to defend the corner and attack the white stone. Your position is quite strong like this unlike the white stone at C6.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[dl];B[jp]C[This move also seems a bit small to me, is that just me or should I have played it elsewhere, maybe at Q100 or an approach at the D16 stone?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: It's true that it isn't the biggest move there is. Attacking at F17 would have been better for you to develop on the top and it will force your opponent to respond. While this gives your opponent the freedom to move against you.

Let's see how it develops.];W[np]
(;B[nq]C[Was it strategic to play low and stop white from taking the lower area, or should I have taken the center influence at say O5?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: this isn't a very good move, because your stone is quite vulnerable like this and it gives white some potential.]

(;B[nc]C[same question here, would it have been smarter to play higher?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: Never connect to a stone. Always play away from it. Diagonal plays are ,in general, much stronger.]
;W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd];W[qe];B[pj]C[This was another move I wasn't sure about... I thought that it worked to attack white's moyo on the right, but at the same time, I feel like it might have been better lower, at R10

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: R10 would have been more solid. But white doesn't have a lot going for it right now so this play is ok. Just know where to play the next stones. This gives some nice center influence where you can still get some points.]
;W[rd]
(;B[rc];W[re];B[qc];W[of]
(;B[qh];W[oh];B[nj]C[I was contemplating this versus R7, do you think this is too small?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: R7 is better. It builds shape this is an escape move, but where are you escaping to? And why are you escaping. First make 2 eyes.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[ql]C[Me: Too small... R7 is defenitely better. It's more loose for you and more threatening for white.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[ro]
(;B[qq]C[Me: this move is not needed. What can white do?
Even if white cuts at R3 you have the advantage and will win the fight. Threatening with P6 is better or even playing toward the center with K10. Or N16 to give yourself more shape on top.]
;W[on]
(;B[ln]C[This move made me think for a second, would it have been better to play more solidly at say N4, or should was it a good idea to go for center influence and limit off the white bottom right group?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: How are you limiting off the bottom right? The center is important but there's nothing there yet. Better to establish some more points for yourself at the bottom where it's relatively easy instead of jumping into the big nothing.]

(;B[rs]C[I feel like this move may have been unneeded and that I was alive anyway.  Is there something I am missing now, or was that move useless?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: Yep. :) See the variations.];W[om];B[nl];W[ol];B[ok]C[Me: A good defence creating nice shape with Q10 O10 and O8 as you can see.]

;W[me]
(;B[hj]C[This move was something I was questioning.  Would it have been better to play at say F10, maybe F11, or was it better to play closer to the center?
Also, this move does very little in ways of threatening white's left.  This was because I felt that white's moyo was very pronounced and I wouldn't be abel to damage it much.  Am I right about this, or should I have attempted to attack it more aggressively?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: Let's see.];W[di]C[Me: but the H10 stone is nice if you can use it to build center territory.]

(;B[fh]C[Me: This connection is quite easy to break. To have better connection play at these or similar points. 1 jump from the stone. 2 and 1 jumps. (2 vertical and 1 horizontal or vice versa)]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[eb];W[cb];B[kg]C[This move was to contain white's right.  Do you think it was too far away, too close, or what?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me: I think it's irrelevant compared to the beauty of a stone to make some moyo for yourself.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me; I disccussed this a few moves earlier.];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej]
;B[dn]SQ[fm][en]C[Me: Once again connecting and setting yourself up for disaster. The squares are much better options.]

(;W[dm];B[en];W[ni];B[mi];W[nh];B[mh];W[ng];B[ie]C[I felt like this fixed up a weakness at the top.  Do you think it was necessary?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me; a weakness at the top would have been K19. As long as K16 is in Atari you don't have to worry about a lot. Well a ko. And that can be a lot. But K19 would have been the better option or even better would have been B3 or K1. Also S8 would have been better but not superior to K1 or B3.]

Me; T7 and 9 to get your 5 stones at the right back. There aren't a lot. Not as much as white has at least. But I think you could have prevented this ko.]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Me; No problem

Your main improvements would be to try and not connect to attack. Actually your not attacking him/her, but allowing your opponent to attack you. If they know how to make use of it.

Also try not to always attack your opponent and only think about reducing their shape. Try making shape. See what leads to the best gains for you. Al though you won this game it might be more interesting to submit a game where you lost. Not only does it show more clearly the mistakes you make, but your instructor can tell you how to make the right move. Instead of you making less than ideal moves that don't really result in significant losses.]
