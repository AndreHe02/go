;B[pd]C[Bhareth Kachroo:
Thanks for reviewing this; when the game began I was confident as the first group I had in a fight managed to live, even though I made some stupid moves... But later on I ended up letting white make some huge walls without meaning to, and I eventually won on time. Is my problem not picking the right move in fights, or should I be focusing on bigger moves around the board instead? Thanks.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[cq]C[nothing bad so far. white playing 4 on 3,3 point means he has guaranteed himself life - he can leave the stone alone and start to attack. Were you alert to this?]

(;B[qq]C[a poor move k16 is better (build a moyo)];W[qo]
(;B[qp]C[you want life - so make lots of space - well as much as possible.]
;W[pq];B[po]C[I think this might have been really stupid.];W[oo]
C[But this doesn't seem like a great response. I looked at R-2, S-4, S-5 as alternatives for white.]
;B[pn];W[qn]C[Wasn't sure what I should be doing here. Should white have played S-4 instead?]
;B[qm]C[For some of these moves I wondered, is this important enough to fight over, or can I afford to ignore this and play a move like D-5 on the other side, and if white keeps playing in the bottom right he might get a few points but I will have an advantage later in the game...
SB - you are going to die big in the corner white at a is worrying to your q5-q6 group.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[ql]C[you need to save your corner group]
(;B[rm];W[rn];B[ro];W[no];B[sn]C[he played poor moves.];W[om]

(;B[do]C[Is this the right time to tenuki? Or should I have taken advantage of weaknesses in white's position in bottom right? Is this the biggest move?
white isn't weak D4 is more normal - your aim should be to shut white in teh corener and make him live small so you gain outside influence.]
;W[mn]C[I didn't get what white was doing here.];B[cp]C[Wasn't sure how to take advantage of the extra moves I was gifted. I tried to kill white in the corner and failed miserably. Looking back I probably should have suffocated the lone stone instead of giving him weaknesses to exploit: play E-3, D-4 instead of C-4 and D-3.
D3 is OK];W[qr];B[rr];W[ps];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr]C[What should I play instead? E-2?]
;W[er];B[bq]C[good for black so far];W[fq];B[hp]C[This was too far in hindsight.
depends what you do?];W[go]
(;B[gp]C[Was jumping out with h-6 better, or f-4 (I put a variation)
yes - If you look at the line acrss the white stones f3 to n6 your stone was inside the sector line - so you are saying you will live inside white's sphere of influence. making your stone heavy is not good.]
;W[fp];B[fo];W[ho]
(;B[gq]C[41 is poor shape - empty triange sometimes work, but the alarm bellls should ring if you think of playing bad shape.]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[eo];B[gs];W[fn];B[fr];W[eq]C[noe your need is to make you black group h2 etc live.]
;B[es]C[this does not help life - it is gote white d1 black f1 and what do you do about white k2?]
;W[ds];B[fs];W[cs];B[bs];W[iq]C[I had recognized earlier that I needed to play here and failed to do that. I thought white could just kill me here, but he failed to do that somehow.]
;B[ir];W[jq]C[If white plays h-3 am I not pretty dead? Or the sequence j-1 k-1 k-2 h-1 with the second eye being false?]
;B[jr];W[kr];B[hq];W[ip]
(;B[en]C[I thought maybe pressuring white by threatening to poke out an eye here might do something but this move is kinda pointless.
he is out into the middle - so you are doing nothing here];W[dn]

;B[bn];W[ek];B[co];W[dl];B[dp]C[Around here I realize that white doesn't want to fill in e-4 because that self-atari for f-5. I completely forget white can ignore this completely because I can't fill in f-5 before e-4.]
;W[hm];B[gn];W[fo];B[jp];W[jo];B[kp];W[kq];B[hn];W[in];B[gl]
;W[hl];B[gk]C[Right around here I regain my wits and realize white has huge outward walls here. So I decide I can't let this black group die because it is the only thing separating the two white sides, and if they link up the game's over.]

;W[eh];B[di];W[ci];B[gf];W[fe];B[ef];W[df]C[you keep on cutting - it would be better to run your weak group to safety - one weak group is OK - more than one and one at least will die!.]
;B[ee];W[dh];B[fd]C[the d12 white group is alive. You need to do some simple things 1) only have one weak group, 2) consistently attack white's weak group.]
;W[ge];B[he];W[je];B[gd]C[I felt that a lot of white's moves leading up to here were kind of strange. White would have been better served by following my group tightly and thus building really good outside thickness. Instead the stones on the right side are not super strong.]
;W[id];B[cf]C[I wanted to strike back and reduce the territory for this group. Maybe it would have been better to play on the right side with all that potential, but I was kinda pissed.]

;W[ai];B[bf]C[Was this unnecessary?];W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[re]
;W[qe];B[rc];W[pc];B[sd]C[Is this the best move? 
yes you have kept white separate - but realise white played poorly. White cam easily live inside a single black stone at 4,4.]
;W[oc]C[I wasn't really sure what to do here.];B[lc]C[I don't think this was very good from me though. The stone's kind of floating without support. In hindsight I was attempting to block the three-stone group from reaching the wall along J and K, but white could have played above me and made a huge outward facing wall and enclosed that huge area. What's the right idea here?]
;W[nd];B[ne]C[what is M17 going to do?why did you play it - it is unlilkely to live.]
;W[oe];B[od];W[mc];B[of]C[And here white loses on time. What are your thoughts? Any guesses to who might have won? What do you think were the differences between Black and White's play? What were my (Black)'s major weaknesses? Any suggestions for improvement? Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.
suggestions for inprovemement 1) have only one weak group 
2) attack only one white group at once, 3) read out what will happen.]
