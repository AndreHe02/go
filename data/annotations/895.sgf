(;B[op]C[Playing on the 5-4 point there when white has already played in the lower left seems strange to me. I have never seen this before (but then I'm just 6k). It would feel better to me to play at Q3, for example, because it doesn't approach the white star-point stone so much and prepares for the "Chinese Opening", which is generally liked by weaker amateurs. See variation one. See variation two for another possibility. The move is not "bad" though.]
;W[cc]
(;B[de]LB[dd:A][df:B]C[The normal approach moves to a stone at the 3-3 point like white's are either A or B.]

(;W[ec]C[Given the position of black's stone, white could play E-16 here. Black would have to answer on the left side and white could extend. Look at the variation.]
;B[hd]LB[fe:A][fd:B][ed:C]C[This is the first bad move by black. You cannot afford to play so losely there. In general, where you are weak you should not play a knight's move, let alone a three-space knight's move. White can easily cut through your shape and get you into a lot of trouble by playing A.
Try to verify yourself that playing B will not work as a link between the stones if white answers at C. If white cuts, black will either get a weak group at the top or on the left.]
;W[dg]LB[fe:A]C[White should divide black by playing at A instead (as said before)]
;B[ef]LB[fe:A][dd:B][dc:C]C[And, obviously, black should play at A here and try to seal white into the corner, building up thickness. Black could also exchange B for C before playing A.]
;W[eg];B[pj];W[fe]C[The right point, but one move too late there :)]
;B[ff];W[ge];B[gf]LB[gg:A]TR[eg][dg][hd]C[Black is pushing too much. The marked black stone is starting to get into trouble. Also, white is pushing one move ahead, which is often a sign that something is going wrong. Kageyama calls this the "struggle to get ahead". If you keep pushing behind, you lose out. Black could try to play at A instead of pushing there. A is a solid diagonal connection and starts causing trouble for the two marked white stones.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[ie]TR[hd]C[Now the marked stone is in real trouble.]
;B[ic]LB[kc:A][id:B]TR[hd][id]C[Too slow. If you are going to save some of your stones, you will have to sacrifice some others. Never try to save all your stones with a move like this. You could play A instead, which is an extension from the right side. and threatens to save the marked stone. If white captures by playing B, he gets territory in the corner but you could then play another move and attack the two stones on the left for compensation.]
;W[id];B[hc]C[Does not look like a lot of space for two eyes with this shape now.]
;W[kc]C[Good move by white.];B[jd];W[jc];B[jb];W[kb];B[gb]LB[ib:A]
[fb:B]C[Black is unconditionally dead after this move if white plays A or B. B is safer because black could later play the sequence in the variation and start a capturing race if it is omitted.]

(;W[fc];B[fb]LB[ib:A]TR[hf][gf][ff][ef][de]C[Not good. This move does not make black any more alive because white can still capture at A. If your (small) group dies, you should be happy to get a free move on the outside. What is more worrying about the sequence black played in there is the wall that white has managed to make. The marked black group will have a hard time now. If it runs away, white will get profit by chasing it.]
;W[ib];B[hb];W[ja];B[eb]C[This move is sente, but black is not going to live. Remember the rule, if you have a line of stones on the second line: 8 live, 6 die. You can verify this yourself on a board. In any case, four stones certainly die.]
;W[ke]
(;B[db]LB[dc:A]C[This is a bit too nice of black. Why not cut at A? instead. Look at the variation.]
;W[dc];B[jf]LB[gi:A]C[This move does not do anything for the shape of black's five stones. This is your chance to attack the two white stones while defending yourself at the same time if you play at A or somewhere.]
;W[if]C[This move seems good to me, better than connecting. Black is in trouble now.]

(;B[kf]LB[ig:A]C[Black should play at A instead. Try to stop white. Look at the variation.]
;W[ig];B[gh];W[ei];B[ed]C[This move does not do anything. Do not play moves because you think they have to be answered. You know white will not let you cut anyway.]
;W[fd];B[df];W[cg]
(;B[fh]C[This move is bad because black's shape was uncuttable anyway. Look at the variation.]
;W[ej];B[je]LB[hi:A]C[Black should definitely not leave the group on the left in this state.White won't have too many problems living at the top so this move is not an attack. If white ignores it and plays A, black will probably die on the left.]

;W[nc]C[Could be one further but is fine.];B[oc];W[od]C[Risky.]

(;B[mc]LB[mb:A]C[If you play at A, you will catch the white stone in a net and white is starting to look dead. You would get a capturing race. See the variation.]

;B[pb];W[qc];B[qb]
(;W[pe]LB[rb:A]C[Useless. White should play hane at A so black does not reach the corner and live! The stone in there could have been capture in a ladder anyway. Look at the variation.]

(;B[ne]LB[nf:A][me:B]C[This links the two groups, which is good. Black does make an empty triangle though. Black A is better shape although you have to read out further to show that white cannot cause trouble by playing B. Look at the variation.]

;W[ql];B[qj]LB[oh:A][kq:B]TR[pj]C[Bad move. Black should either push at A to use his marked stone or extend on the bottom to B or somewhere. The idea of keeping white separated is sound though.]

Both of you should play bigger moves in the opening rather than fight around. Black should also try to ignore fewer of his opponents moves. Ignoring moves led to the loss of the group in the middle (which was too big to sacrifice for the lower left corner!)
Once or twice you should both have given up two or three stones instead of saving them. Remember, the goal is to surround territory. Black and white should bothmake sure they canrecognize the difference between real and false eyes...
