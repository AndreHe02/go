C[
 nonny: Dear Reviewer.  Thank you in advance for reviewing this game for roro (B) and nonny (W).    In addition to comments you might have for anything you deem appropriate, would you please look in particular at

 (1) what W should do in the fuseki   (2) local fights.
 (3) proper direction of play    Again, thanks!

Hi nonny! Sorry for the delay, I had several times started to comment the game, but my editor crashed too often, so I switched to another, hoping it's getting better now ;-)

This game is difficult for me to review, since you both played very well. Doesn't feel like 17k at all! I hope the commentary is nevertheless usefull.

;W[po];B[np];W[qk]C[I think B should play somewhere on the bottom to make use of O4.]
;B[oc];W[jq];B[cf];W[fc];B[bd];W[qg]C[W takes the most attraktive points himself (as far as I can tell). Good!

Maybe playing at R12 would have been better, so as not to invite a B invasion at R11 (which is still possible but a lot more difficult to play)]
;B[qi];W[ri]C[Running out to P13 is not very attractive for w, that's the reason why playing at R12 would have been better.  I think w should nevertheless forst extend to p13, let b play p11 and then maybe connect via S11. Another possibility would be to play P9, b N11. This is difficult for me to decide.]
;B[rh];W[qh];B[rj];W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[rm]
C[Play at S13 first. b usually answers by capturing an this strengthens your wall.]

[pr][rr][sr][as][bs][qs][rs][ss]C[You've got a very good "feeling" for the opening. You play very save and cautiously, which is good.

I think I would have done a better job (as 5k that should be expected at least ,-), but you're playing so good that it's really hard to precisely explain why and how. What I could offer you were some examples how I would play or what I would expect. I hope this is at all usefull, sorry if not. Please feel free to ask me questions about moves played or my commentary.

You actually lost the game because of that b capture, which is bitter. You got a better sense of big plays and a very solid style, you wont stay long at 17k! ;-)

This game has been very exciting to watch!
