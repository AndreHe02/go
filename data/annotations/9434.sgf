AB[dd][pp]C[Eric: Hello, this was a close game.  I think I can point out some things.

Eric: Two ideas to think about. 1) In the opening, does this play create territory or influence and which do I want.  2) When I make this play how will my opponent likely responds, and do I want that play]
;W[dq];B[pd];W[nc];B[oc]SQ[nd][qf]C[Should I have gone there?

Eric:  This is a little unusual, but not absurd.  R14 is the most ususal response.  Your  move forces a local response, most usually at O16.  Think if white tenuki's, then black could play O16.]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jd]SQ[qc]C[What is the best move here?

Eric: This looks like a fair result for both players, but the corner still has some vulnerability to white playing at 3-3.]
;B[pj]SQ[cj]C[
Eric: This is OK, as an extension from the top and bottom, however both can be cut.  Black is creating a lot of influence but little territory.  Maybe C10?]
;W[ql]C[Best response here?];B[qj]SQ[qk]C[Eric:  This is a very passive response.  If it is assumed that you need the handicap, then you must not try to solely play defensively.  R( forces a local response.]
;W[ro];B[qq]C[Eric: I do not like S5, for me, R^ is better. It makes an eye and threatens S4.  However, your respnse is much too passive.  What if black plays O4?  Black may live very small in the corner.]
;W[ol]SQ[pn]C[Eric: Q6 seems like better shape for White and stil accomplishes moving to the middle.]
;B[mq]SQ[lq]C[The sequence of moves from here led to me being nearly sealed in the corner, what could have been done to avoid this?

Eric: This move is not too bad.  It makes a living group.  M3 is OK too.  Having a living group is better than a group that can be threatened and pushed around.]
;W[kq];B[lp]SQ[ip][iq]C[Eric: This is a timid move.  Think of what your opponent will play in response.  How about playing J3 or J4 and making your opponent uncomfortable?  With the D3 stone, White would love to build a wall to face it.]
;W[kp];B[ko]C[Eric:  I understand, "hane at the head of 2"   Not a bad idea but consider the board and what White wants.]
;W[jo]
(;B[lo]SQ[ln]C[Eric: Think about this, I understand you do not want to be cut.  But consider the variation with M6 instead.]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[ml];B[cp]SQ[rp]C[At this point I gave up on the other corner, was that justified?

Eric: I would have played S4.  White can thank Black for this move as it allows him to face stones against his already strong stones.]
;W[dp];B[cn];W[cq];B[bp]C[Eric: OK];W[bq];B[dj]C[Eric: Good]
;W[cf]
(;B[cc]SQ[fc][ch]C[Eric: F17 or C12 look better to me.];W[ef]
;B[fc]SQ[gc]C[Eric: nothing forces this small move, though it is nice to get a nearly living shape.  With the room you have on the board, consider G17.]
;W[bd]C[Eric: This seems funny since the plays are out  of sequence.]
;B[bc];W[ci];B[cj]C[Eric: A fine response.];W[bj];B[bk];W[bi]

;W[hn];B[hm];W[gn];B[gm];W[fn];B[fm];W[ni];B[ph]C[Eric: Now, Black and white both have influence toward the center.  Blacak can still lose the corner, and white gained larger territory.]
