C[Hi dear reviewer,Thanks for your time.
I feel I played bad during the opening and eventually it was easy win for white.
I would like to see points which would help me to improve my game,thank you.


FM: Hello, my name is Martin and my comments will begin with "FM" as my nick is Field Mouse]

;B[qi];W[on]C[It was hard to decide about the next move.
I am not sure if i played the best way]
(;B[np]LB[lp:A][hq:B]C[FM: this direction is good, but this move is leaving a too big hole in the black position. Both A and B will be much easier for white than if the last move was played at N4. This move would make sense if the white group was weak, which is not true now.]
;W[dr]LB[hq:A]C[Same here,i am not sure p11 was the optimal move now

FM: this result is okay for white. Directly invading at A would be a bit more active.]

(;B[oi]LB[nc:C][ok:A][pm:B]C[FM: the meaning of this move is "if you do not defent at A, I will play there or at B!" If that is not blacks aim then playing C is better.]
;W[nc]LB[ob:B][pc:A][ok:C][pm:D]TR[oi]C[Better to defend at q17?

FM: yes. Playing at A is the easy way, playing more aggresive move at B is also possible. The important idea is not to let white into the corner. And to get to attack the white group with C or D.]

(;B[lc];W[qc]C[FM: this is a bit painful for black]

;W[ne]
(;B[nf]LB[qb:C][oe:A][pf:B]C[Looking back this was probably a poor play

FM: this is very agressive technique. The problem is that after black loses the AB liberties black will have to take two white stones at C, which makes the fight a bit harder. Still it looks playable.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[me]
(;B[mg]LB[lg:A][mh:C][nh:B]C[FM: this move is generaly not a good shape as it is hard to push on any of the two white groups after it because it has the ABC weaknesses.]

;B[qi];W[qb];B[rb];W[ri]
(;B[kf];W[lg]C[FM: white is happy to be forced to this as the connection means that white stones are not weak anymore]

;W[cf];B[fe];W[jg]
(;B[hf]LB[db:A][er:B]C[FM: this move is super slow. There is nothing urgent in the center anymore so it is time to play the big points - AB.]
;W[lq]TR[np]C[I responded bad and eventually lost all my territory.
Perhaps it was better to play k3?


FM: because of the marked stone left a big hole there black cannot really save much here and as there is no white group to attack on the board the oustide influence will not have big value too. Still black can try to play something active]

(;W[db]C[FM: this is quite slow, though it is not small];B[cg]

(;B[ik]C[FM: this makes it too easy for white. Black is very short on territory now so playing from this side is not an option at all]
;W[il];B[hk];W[lj];B[jl];W[kl];B[jm];W[kh];B[mm]C[I gave up my stones for points around the center but this does not look like a good trade after white is reducing afterwards

;W[ol];B[om]LB[eb:A][pm:B]C[FM: this move is not good as it takes away one black liberty and destroys some aji at B. Black should play directly at A]

C[FM: finally black choses to fight];W[em]

SQ[jl][lp][op]C[After this point the game is a simple yose.
Again,thanks for your time.


FM: I think black lost this game because of the lack of the fighting spirit. There were some technical mistakes in the fuseki like the ABCD moves or letting white to connect easily his upper group, which gave white slight advantage, but the situation was not critical. But with the move at C black stopped trying to fight with white at all. First black let white live very easily on the lower side in sente and then black sacrificed some points to build walls around the center just to give it away at the moment when white asked for it.

My experience is that in go there are two very important things that black lacked in this game:
1) always keep looking on the points you would like to play and if possible always try to find ways to play them (for example C17, E2 in this game) - examples of weak moves are the triangle marked stones, which could be easily played elsewhere
2) big portion of thinking energy should be used to try to counter opponents plans, especially when the opponent is strong. Examples of weak moves are the square marked ones. Just ask what does the opponent want here and what can be done against it. "Nothing" is a relevant answer as long as the question is asked but sometimes it is possible to find a better solution.]
