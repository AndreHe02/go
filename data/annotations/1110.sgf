C[mattn -- Hello, Tom.  I'm an 8k* on NNGS.  My playing style tends to be more fighting-oriented, so maybe I can give you some ideas on reducing or invading white's territories, and defending your own.]
PL[B];C[Tom -- This is a recent game of mine against the computer programme Go Pro III; apparently it is the best computer go player.  I took black in a game with komi = 5.5.  The programme was on its top level and beat me by 21.5 stones.  This was an excellent result for me.

Usually when I play, my games are very peaceful and I end up with alot of territory around the edge but lose because my opponent gets a large area in the centre.  I realize that this is likely to happen, but it seems to happen anyway.  I am beginning to suspect that I am psycologically averse to playing in, what seem to me, exposed positions on the board.  In this game I made a deliberate attempt to be aggresive, and to stop this happening.]
;B[dc];W[qd];B[pq];W[dp]
(;B[qn]C[A little greedy, but playable.];W[jq]C[White really wants to play D15 now.  It would be a wonderful framework.  Black, on the other hand, doesn't have very good prospects for creating such a large framework.  Time to make some.. :)]

(;B[dj]C[This should probably be at D11.  If D17 was at D16, this would be better.

Also, an approach on the bottom corner before playing this move is probably a good idea.]
;W[de];B[cd]C[I don't like this move.  It's too timid, and protecting your corner isn't as big as you might think.  The two 3-4 stones seems to be guarding about 9 points of territory, for 4.5 points per move.  Komi is supposed to be half the value of an opening move, and sometimes is as high as 8 points.  So in the opening, you should be shooting for a higher efficiency than 4.5 points per move.

The variation given above where black plays under the white stone with C15 is probably the best way to play this corner.  It would help if D10 was at D11, though.]
;W[ce];B[cg]LB[fc:a][fe:b][eg:c][he:d]TR[eb][fb][fa][ea][da]
[db][dh][di]C[Tom -- Have I lost out here?

mattn -- It's hard to say.  Black can push the two white stones a bit, but chances are he won't profit much from it. A sequence like a-b-c-d is reasonable, but black isn't getting nearly enough profit for this.  8 points *maximum*, probably much less.  Since it took 3 black moves to get here, you only would make about 2.7 points per move.  This isn't really enough for the opening.]
;W[cn]
(;B[cl]C[This move is not good.  It loosely surrounds *maybe* three more points.  It's just not big enough to worry about right now.  The two black stones are not in any danger of death anyway.

White has some very bad aji on the board -- two white stones with no base.  Black's strategy needs to revolve around exploiting this aji.. the best (and most fun!) way to do this is to make a wall and then run white straight into it.  Pure profit for black.]
;W[kc]C[Now a black move at P16 is no longer so great.  In the span of a single move, the game seems to have swung in white's favor.]

(;B[ph]C[This move seems inconsistant with the low play at R6, but it seems playable enough.  A low play here would also be bad, so this makes as much sense.  See the variation for another way to play, if you are worried about reducing the upper-right.]
;W[nq];B[hc];W[od]
(;B[or]C[Tom -- Is it too early to try this?  I was thinking that this move is sente, so I should get it in first.  However, I suppose it is only sente if there is nothing bigger for white than to respond.

mattn -- A play in the lower left is really what you want.  White may look like he has control of the area, but the 3-3 point is still open, and black may even be able to play at F3 and then run to the center (though it could end in a tough fight.

Also note that if R6 was at R5, the corner would be more solid.  As it is, white may be able to attack if you don't play P2 or something similar.  Tough decision, but C3 is bigger by a good chunk.]
;W[nr];B[ns]C[While P2 was playable, O1 should probably wait.  White can probably let you get away with a jump to M1 without a terrible loss.  Again, C3 is a big target.  P6 or Q9 are both large as well, and will make things more difficult for white in that area.]
;W[oj];B[qj];W[eq]LB[cb:a][bj:b][rp:c][pb:d][cq:e]C[a: 18
b: 12
c: 35
--------
Black has ~65 points

d: 25
e: 35
komi: 5
--------
White has ~65 points

The game is close, but I predict that white can easily get about 10 points ahead of black in the middle game.  Black is in a low position all around, while white can expand his lower side nicely into the center, basically unopposed.  It's going to be hard for black from here.]
;B[qf]C[K5 (or a similar move) *needs* to be played.  White will easily form territory while attacking black, but black should be able to survive.  If white gets K5 or K6, the game is going to be even more difficult for black.]
;W[om];B[pm]CR[nn][no][np][mp][lp][kp][jp][ip][hp][gp][fp][ep]
[eo][en][fn][gn][hn][in][jn][kn][ln][mn]C[This move is too timid.  P7 is not a forcing move.  Even though white can later play R7ish, it isn't that big, considering how strong white's center is becoming.  Now K5 will be tough for black.    In fact, the area surrounded by circles looks like it will be almost all white's.  This is about 30 points.  Assuming black can reduce it a bit, it is almost exactly the 20 point lead that white had in this game.]
;W[ol]C[White should play this around K6 without even thinking.]
;B[pl]C[Same advice for black.. ;)];W[ms];B[os];W[gm]C[Ouch.]
;B[le]C[Tom -- I considered N2 here.  Would it have been better.  More generally, most of my moves seem to be forced, it is something of a mystery to me why this is.  I thought I saw an opportunity for a forcing move myself so I took it.

mattn -- N2 isn't as big as it might look right now.  I like this play -- it might not be ideal, but it will certainly make things interesting, and it's quite playable.  You've got a potential invasion going, and this move also hurst the C15-D15 group.  I like it.

Hopefully, some of the variations will show you that you haven't neccesarily been forced.  Improving your counting ability (even just in terms of estimation) can help you know when a local response is needed.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[lj]C[I'm reminded of the proverb "Even an idiot connects against a peep"  Guess the computer never heard that one.  :)]
;B[nd];W[nc]
(;B[mi]C[Not the right idea for this situation.  You've spent three moves weakening white's corner, so now is the time to cash in!]
;W[mj];B[ik]TR[ce][de]C[Tom -- I felt quite brave to play here.

mattn -- As well you should.. :)

Of course, this move also helps to choke the marked stones even more, so you get two things for the price of one.]
;W[jl];B[no]C[I think white should have made better use of the circumstances here.]

(;W[mn]C[This move is not so good, especially with the N2 cut on the board.]
;B[mr]C[Good idea.];W[il];B[hk];W[oe];B[jr];W[ir];B[kr];W[kq]
;B[mq];W[lp];B[mp]C[This exchange was quite good for black.  Now I see why white won by 20 instead of the 30 I was looking at earlier.]
;W[ki];B[bm]TR[le][ne][nd][mi]C[Ack!  White L11 wasn't making any territory, so clearly it had some other intention.  Notice how white now has some stones poking through your black walls in the upper left.  I'd bet the wily devil is trying to save the C15-D15 group.

Plus, the marked black stones aren't terribly strong or connected anymore.]
;W[ii]C[Tom -- The usual storey here, the computer plays in the centre while I can't bring myself to leave profit at the edges.

mattn -- Be sure to realize *why* the computer is playing there, though.  There is no room to make white territory there, so it's just dame.  He's after the two white stones left over from the opening..]
;B[jh];W[ji]C[This only strengthens white.  It's a thin line between a good forcing move and a "thank-you" move -- one which the opponent is glad to do.  If you are interested, the book Attack and Defense can help with understanding this concept.  It's a very well done book.]
;B[em];W[en];B[ap]TR[bm][cn]C[Tom -- This is a move I read about.  I was quite pleased I spotted it.  It seems to grab alot of territory.  Was it a good move?

mattn -- Definitely!  The monkey jump (A4 in relation to the marked stones) is a wonderful tool to have.  The value of it is usually somewhere from 10-16 points.]
;W[hh]C[Of course, we can't forget what is happening elsewhere.. :)

A splitting move is needed right away.  E13 or F13 might work, though it would be important to read out at least a few moves before choosing.  I'd take the looser (but more in-the-way) F13 here if forced to decide without reading.]
;B[fd]LB[ef:a]C[This is also a thank you move.  The natural response for white is at (a), but this is also exactly where white wants to play in order to move towards the H12 stone.]
;W[bp]C[Well, that's just silly.  :)

In this case, you should let white kill the A4 stone and play at F13.  Those two white stone have no right to live after such neglect by their owner.. :)]

C[Tom -- I felt quite good about these moves,  they looked a bit like what goes on in pro games sometimes.  I suspect though, that this may be because I don't understand what it going on in either situation.

mattn -- Hey, none of us do.. :)

I liked these moves.  The sacrifice tactic was a good idea here.  The only problem that I can see is that they ended in gote (loss of initiative).  You still really want to play E13 to cut white off, though.  Either that or saving the two black stones along line 9 should be top priority.  This was a good sequence, though.]
;W[co];B[bn]C[Tom -- By this stage white seems to have got some big areas without me really seeing much opportunity to stop him.  Could you make it a bit clearer how he managed it?

mattn -- Hopefully, the analysis up to this point has helped with that.]
;W[re];B[rf];W[gf]C[Last chance to cut white off.  Let's see if it can be done.]

(;B[nf]C[Tom -- I wanted to make a move towards linking the strings in this area.  They looked a bit precarious, but capable of surrounding a bit of territory, possibly.  I thought I could probably run out to the right, and maybe to the top left too.

mattn -- You were right about precarious, but wrong about the territory.  At most, they could get one or two points (remember, white's going to keep pushing in as you build up the territory there, and he has more power in the area).]
;W[ef]C[If I had played here first, would it have been good?  I didn't see the opportunity I'm afraid.

mattn -- I'm sure you know my answer by now.. :)];B[of];W[pk]
;B[qk];W[on]
(;B[op]C[Q5 seems more to the point here.];W[po];B[qo];W[bf]
C[Oh dear, I didn't see the damage white could do here.

mattn -- It's pretty nasty.  Weak strings can turn deadly as soon as they connect to a strong living group.  Go is all about connections.]
;B[bg]C[This is a solid way of dealing with the situation.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[oi];B[oh];W[pi];B[qi];W[pb];B[pn]C[All this sente stuff is a bit of a mystery to me.  Is there anywhere I could have played here that would have forced a response?

mattn -- Sente is a tricky thing.  I can make a move that threatens to kill a 10 stone group, which should be sente by anybody's standard, but if the other player doesn't respond was it a sente play?    Sente has a lot to do with the relative value of plays on the board.  If there were only one-point plays left (or maybe 2-3 point plays), then this move would be sente.  As it is, there may be larger plays elsewhere, in which case it is gote.  Tricky stuff, but it will come on it's own, given time and games..]
;W[ac];B[ab];W[ad];B[bb];W[gk]C[White saved C15-D15 *and* cut off H9-J9.  Ouch.]

;W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[be];W[ae];B[cf];W[be];B[bh]C[That was probably a reasonable exchange for black.  Even if you don't kill white, he has a really ugly shape, which will give you a better chance at making points by attacking the group.  You might gain points or you might not, but it didn't cost you anything to make white so ugly, so you're doing OK here.]

;B[ml];C[Tom -- As I said, I think I played above my normal game here, any pointers as to which moves were good, and which bad, together with comments about my general strategic failings would be welcome.  Thanks very much.      mattn -- Well, hopefully my comments and variations have been helpful to you, Tom.  I'd recommend that you play around with some of the variations using a real board, if you have access to one.  It often helps to see the ways the stones work together right in front of you, shift them around, feel the interactions, etc.  This is especially true for the opening variations, and getting a feel for influence and potential territories.

If you have any more questions about the game or about my comments and variations, let me know at men99@hampshire.edu

Good luck!])
