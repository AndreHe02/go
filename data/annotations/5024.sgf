C[<sestir> White was ahead in early fuseki but left a weak stone on the right edge, which came under attack and lost a lot. 

Review for white.
-----------------------------

<spearmint> Hi, I played white in this game. I lost at the end due to misreading a cut, but its the play before that which I'm interested in.

Thanks for the review!

(;W[qc];B[nd];W[mc];B[nc]C[<sestir> As usual, we should not push if we are not going to cut. This wastes one ko-threat and reduces black's liberties by one.]
;W[nb];B[re]
(;W[qj]C[<spearmint> I felt I could ignore black's play at S15, because cancelling out the influence of the wall felt more important than securing the corner in gote.

<sestir> S16 is an endgame move. Neutralizing the wall is an excellent idea.

R10 may be too close to the wall. See variantions.]
(;B[kc]C[<sestir> I guess black intends to sacrifice this stone for a wall.]
;W[md]
(;B[lb];W[mb]C[<sestir> This looks good for white.];B[nf];W[hc]
C[<spearmint> I think this was a mistake? The result I got seems unsatisfactory - would it have been better to cut at M15, followed by black H17, white F17?


<sestir> Yes, but the right side looks bigger. I would play there. The bigger the wall, the bigger the side, and as you noted, bH17 wF17 and the group will be a burden.]
;B[ke];W[cj];B[ql]C[<spearmint> This move seemed to hurt, should I have played C10 at R6 instead?


<sestir> Yes. Your original aim was to neutralize the black wall. This has to be done with strong groups. The worst thing you can do is to place a weak and heavy group there. R10 is not heavy but it is not strong either.]
;W[oj]C[<spearmint> I felt B was too strong at the top for me to extend in that direction...

<sestir> Correct. =)];B[ol]

"I felt B was too strong at the top for me to extend in that direction..."]
;B[pi];W[pj];B[rk];W[qi];B[cf];W[ce]C[<sestir> Good choice.]

(;W[bn]C[<sestir> Maybe a little too defensive here. Any move along the bottom is very big.

I think this is where white lost the game.];B[eo];W[oh]
(;B[pg];W[ph];B[iq];W[nq]C[<spearmint> I thought that B choosing to play at J3 instead of K3 or L3 gave me space for this invasion.

<sestir> Or black could have played K4 or L4.];B[pq];W[kq];B[jo]
;W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[gq];W[if]C[<spearmint> Being behind on territory, I felt something drastic was needed

<sestir> A reasonable attack.];B[id]
(;W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[jd]
(;W[ih];B[gh]
(;W[gj];B[hi];W[ii]C[<sestir> This is not playable.

When a black group cuts between two close white groups, it is an ultimate splitting attack and means that the two white groups will have to make two eyes each - four eyes, while black just needs to make two.

It usually takes 2 or 3 moves to make an eye so white loses several moves here.

The strategy should be to avoid being split like this, by not trying to connect the two groups but develop them in different directions.

b+15, the top left corner is not yet territory];B[hj];W[hk]
C[<sestir> This looks like a ladder.];B[ij];W[ki]C[<spearmint> was this ok?

<sestir> NO. 

<spearmint> I tried to play in a way which kept my stones at J12 strong, while keeping the pressure on blacks group.]
;B[jj];W[kg]C[<spearmint> perhaps too defensive? or was this necessary?

<sestir> It depends on what you are trying to do.];B[lf];W[ao]

;B[mo];W[oq];B[oo]
(;W[or];B[pr];W[jm]C[<spearmint> seems like an overplay now I look at it...

<sestir> End of review.

Main points:

1) Use strong groups to neutralize walls. This can mean to make sure that a lonely stone has three directions in which it can be developed.

2) Keep your groups strong in the fuseki.

3) Never let your opponent get a move like H10 without proper compensation - 50 points or so.

Hope my review will help.
Best regards,

(;B[md];W[lc];B[ql];W[oj];B[ol]C[<sestir> I can not say that R10 is wrong because the black wall has weaknesses. This could lead to a fight.

If S15 was on Q14, it would be wrong for sure, because black would be stronger and would have time to make an iron pillar with Q3.]
