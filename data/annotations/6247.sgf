C[Thank you for your comments and advices ;)

Thanks for a chance to review this game - i enjoyed it. Overall I think you played pretty well. You were ahead quite confortably before your stones got cut off, so if you'd just been a bit more careful there, you would have won without the scare you got at the end. 

Because there wasn't much close fighting, except for the invasion in the bottom right, it's hard to really say anything about that aspect - you defended the invasion well, however. I've commented on where you could have played more obviously in the opening - several of the odd moves you identified yourself, but given the game was quite peaceful, and you were ahead quite comfortably, the only thing that really strikes me to say is to look at the opening again.]
;B[pc];W[cp];B[qp]C[This position on the bottom, with two stones facing each other, means playing on the bottom very soon is pretty important. If I were white, I would consider playing P4, immediately.]

(;W[dd];B[oq]LB[ep:A][jp:B]C[Yep, or at A or B, perhaps.];W[qj]

(;B[qe];W[eq];B[ql]LB[fc:C][cj:A][ck:B]C[I would probably play on the left hand side here, at A or B, or maybe approach the top star point stone at C]
;W[qg];B[ol]LB[fc:C][jd:B][dj:A]C[This is a big move, but I think that there are bigger moves on the board, such as those marked.]
;W[cj];B[jq]CR[eq][oq]LB[jc:A][jd:B]TR[qg][qj]C[I think I should have played at A instead, because this extansion is bigger and put mor pression on the two marqued white stones...

What do you think ?

Yeah, I agree. I think playing high at B might be best, but two enclosures on the bottom are completed and the stones marked with a circle are on the third line, so I think the bottom side is less important now.]
;W[jc]
(;B[lc]LB[cc:A][ej:B]C[This invasion at A is the correct move I think.

What do you think ?

I thought it might be a bit too early, but the variations I tried out look pretty good for black, so maybe. My instinct would be to play B first, and then probably invade the corner.]
;W[je];B[ej];W[dh]TR[jc][je]C[Now the three triangled stones are in place, invading the corner is looking like very good timing, so I would be looking to invade as soon as possible.]

(;B[el]C[I'm not sure about this move. I would be tempted to leave the Capping stone for the time being.]

(;B[ln]C[I don't like this move, but I can't see another one...

This is a pretty good result for white];W[kp]C[I think the white stone needs to run towards the left, not to the right.

The next sequence is a disaster for white.

Given that white's invasion fails, it would probably bet better to defend the top left, to stop you from getting the 3-3 invasion. What actually happens, is that white fails to successfully invade the right, and you managed to get the 3-3 still.]

(;B[ko];W[rp]C[This is a tricky invasion, but you handle it well. It's easy to make a mistake and let white live in these situations.]

I think getting this move in is very big for you.]
