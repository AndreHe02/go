C[[DP\] Hi Mark - I've been through the game and some general tips follow:
a) set the handicap correctly - with Gnugo at 3k and yourself at 10k, you should be taking 7 stones
b) go for the big points - the corners at the beginning, and kakaris (approach moves) or the middle of the sides next.  See move 5 for the first example
c) don't try to defend dead groups - the sequence on the left hand side probably cost you around 50 points and the game
d) resign at the appropriate point.  It's considered bad etiquette to make invasions where there is no chance of survival - a human opponent wouldn't have been too impressed with K10 (move 103) and the moves that followed. My comments end at move 62 as the game is already completely over.
e) make a plan and stick with it - the invasion at D10 needed to be stabilised with a move like C7
f) don't try to save every stone - sacrifice when you need to, such as on the left]
;B[qo]C[[DP\] Make sure you know the basic set of 5-3 point joseki if you're going to open with this move. More standard would be the 4-3 or 4-4 points. Get yourself a copy of "38 basic joseki" if you don't already have it.]
;W[ep];B[gq]C[[DP\] Attacking with a kakari (approach move) is ok - alternatives would be either of the two open corners. However, the standard approach moves are at C4 or C3, to restrict W's corner]
;W[de];B[mq]C[[DP\] You should play in top right.  N3 is too territorial and immediately lets W get influence over the whole board with the next move]
;W[pd];B[qj]C[[DP\] Too small again.  Your choices are kakari, or the side points  You have one small area, which is not solid.  W has whole board influence]
;W[cp];B[pq]C[[DP\] Too small once more.  You need to be more expansive in your thinking.  W is v. happy how this is developing - as far as Gnugo can be happy!]
;W[go];B[ho]C[[DP\] This solidifies W position, giving huge influence on the left hand side.  Meantime you get maybe 20 points of not very secure territory.  Not a good exchange.  You urgently need to get in on the left - D10 would probably work.  Remember that contact moves are defensive - you should be attacking.]
;W[ch];B[dj]C[[DP\] Bit late, but better late than never];W[dc]
;B[ce]C[[DP\] Why?  You need to stabilise D10 with something like C7 first.  This just gives W two strong positions surrounding D10 which will get swallowed up.]
;W[cd];B[cf]C[[DP\] Very heavy, and inviting W to play the E12 splitting move]
;W[eh]C[[DP\] Oh dear...]
(;B[df]C[[DP\] At this stage you should split with D12 and sacrifice one of the groups]
;W[ee];B[qg]C[[DP\] Too small, yet again.  C7 is the urgent point (you should never have played C15 - might as well let them go) and a close second would be O17]
;W[fj];B[qe]C[[DP\] So you're happy to sacrifice the entire left hand side in exchange for 5 points here?  The attack from O17 would be much more powerful.  Your sequence solidifies the W position and makes it much harder for you to invade]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[rc];B[sd];W[cl];B[dl]C[[DP\] This is the correct time to play a contact move - you're under extreme pressure here and so need to escape to the centre]
;W[dm]
(;B[el]C[[DP\] No, this is heavy - jump to F8 and sacrifice one of the stones]
;W[gl];B[ek]C[[DP\] Empty triangle.  You can't live in this area as you ignored it for so long - your only hope would be to break out.  Or better still, use the aji of those stones to get some on the outside to negate W influence.]

;W[dn];B[fl];W[gm];B[gp]C[[DP\] A truly horrible sequence of 20 moves which has a) killed your D10 stones, b) killed your C15 stones c) solidified W corner for a good 25 points and d) gained you maybe 5 points in return.  When a group is dead, don't add stones.]
;W[jm];B[jn]C[[DP\] Contact moves are defensive.  You need to be attacking (desparately) given how the game is going.  O17 or K17/18 are the last big points around]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[me]C[[DP\] As black I would probably have resigned around move 32, but definitely now!]
