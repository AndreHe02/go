C[DC: Hi, Dylan Carter 1d UK. This is Round 7 of the LOGC2013. I seemed to put myself behind. I require the reviewer to hit on the key points of error that put me behind in the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[ql]LB[qk:A]C[The chinese fuseki at A is more common]
;W[qf]LB[nc:B][jp:C][mp:A]C[I think A, B or C would be more normal.  Here, white plays a stone in black's influence while there is a lot of open space on the board still.]
;B[qe]LB[pf:F][qf:E][qi:D][qj:C][qk:B][ql:A]C[This strengthens white.  It is better to attack white.

If A would have been at B, the game move would be ok as white can't extend to C but only to D (which is too narrow in combination with the two-stone wall of E-F]
;W[pf]
(;B[nd];W[pi]LB[qi:B][qj:A]C[I would play B (or maybe A)
The game move doesn't give white a good base];B[fq]LB[ql:C]
[jp:A][pq:B]C[I would prefer A, which works well in combination with the right-side stones (B and C).
In the game, white can pincer and make it difficult for black to make a moyo.
If black can't make a moyo, B-C looses in value.];W[hq]
(;B[cq]LB[ql:C][pq:B]C[DC: I cashed in!

janr: but B-C gets weaker after white gets an influence (= no moyo)]

Black needs to do something with the lower right, giving white sente.]
;W[lc];B[nb];W[po]C[There is still free space in the upper left.  that would be bigger]

TR[ol][pl][ql]C[Doesn't work (bla√©ck can cut).  Why not just connect at A ?
If Back B, White C keeps the marked stones isolated (which is bad for black after his chinese opening start with 3 more stones on the right as white)]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn];B[oo]C[Black can squeeze nicely.];W[pn]

(;B[nm]TR[pf][qf][pi]C[DC: Helping White?

Black can't connect, so this game move may destroy aji.  Trying to attack the marked group seems the priority now.]
;W[mn];B[kp]LB[nm:B][on:A]C[I expected A here, as letting white connect is not good for black (the stone at B loses his meaning)]
;W[jp];B[ko];W[on]C[It is bad to let white connect.];B[mo]C[Black ends even in gote and white can defend his right-side group]

;W[kk];B[mi];W[mg]LB[cf:C][qf:A][rn:B]C[I don't see the value of this white attack now.
White's groups A and B are stable, so seeing first what happens on the left (by playing C e.g.) seems better.  Later, depending on what happens there, white can choose in which direction to chase the black group.]

(;B[cc]C[Taking the corner is small, and it strengthens white.  Black doesn't want white to get stronger while his center group is not cleanly settled.  Why not expand the center group and run into one of the two sides (see variation) ?]

S9 is bigger endgame];W[rf];B[re];W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[rc]C[Nobody seems to care about S9.

How about b5?]

C[

In summary, black started with a big territory Chinese-like opening on the right, but in the end failed to build a territory or moyo.  Instead, white split at Q5 and then attacked the central of the three initial black stones.  
Black played too submissively in the middle game fight.
Also Black's endgame can be improved.])
