C[Hello dear reviewer, in this game I played black. In the end I lost the game by resign after a huge group of mine died, but I think even without it dying white would have been ahead. I added questions and comments with Za:

I have accounts on different servers ranking 1d-3k (here I used a new nickname on KGS with no rank yet) but especially when my oponnent threatens to build a huge framework with a wall I fall apart in my moral and fighting spirit :( maybe I need more concentration on fundamentals like counting. If you could, I would love to hear ideas and/or comments on how I could have handled the decisive situations better, because I want to improve now and hope getting reviews will point me in the right direction.

Dear Zasb,

I am your reviewer.

(;B[fb]C[tapir: You force your opponent to fix his weakness.]
;W[dd];B[jc];W[ef];B[ge]TR[fb][ee]C[Za: Was this already a mistake, and I should have resisted more with F14, F13, G14?

tapir: The problem isn't that you feel required to fix the weakness now, but the moves that led to this situation. I would put blame firmly on E15 and F18. Two moves that together achieve less than simply connecting at F16.]
;W[ff]LB[gf:A][cn:B]C[Za: Here I didn't felt comfortable with approaching D3, because of whites wall in the top, but maybe I was to submissive with not approaching his stone? Is approaching D3 still a viable option? I played L3 next, because simply enclosing with P3 also felt too unimaginary. Mostly I didn't want to approach D3 because I still don't know many joseki from the 3-4 stone, especially high pincers I do not know what black can do besides  attatching at the corner or jumping out for splitting pincer and corner stone, and all that didn't seem appealing to me.

tapir: Don't let fear dictate your way of playing. Unless you are someone learning hundreds of variations by heart easily your only way to get started is to try it in games and learn from mistakes. A and B are the two moves I would consider. A even if it is painful to make more moves in this area. B as an approach that is hard to pincer efficiently.]

(;B[kq];W[do];B[pj];W[gf]C[Za: I felt if I would answer at H15 white would (push some more) or play J3 directly and black L5 and white would have a large moyo with a fine wall, and would have many good possibilities to reduce my potential, but black wouldn't have good moves to do the same to whites potential, because there is no aji? So I invaded deep with C7 next, was my reasoning wrong?]
;B[cm]C[tapir: Now you invade, where you didn't dare to approach earlier.]
;W[bn];B[dj];W[bm]
(;B[em];W[cl]C[Za: Should I have answered lighter here, for example with a jump to F10 or H7?

tapir: I am biased towards F10, but I am far from sure about my reasoning, your group got heavier already with E7. Either way it wasn't so easy to attack your group.]
;B[dl];W[ck];B[dk];W[iq];B[ko];W[io]C[Za: Should I have invaded with G3 here? I played H9 next.

tapir: I believe G3 is not good here.];B[hk];W[he]C[Za: I feel like C7 was my biggest mistake, the whole group doesn't seem to work good with my stones and is just a burden, but I was so afraid in the game to let white develop his potential on the left side that I came in so early, but it was probably very bad?

tapir: In my opinion the exchanges on the left side gained very little for White and produced a relatively strong group for you.]

(;B[hc]C[tapir: So painful. Did you ever consider sacrificing this whole mess? White would need two moves to firmly capture the whole thing.]
;W[oq];B[op]C[Za: I wanted to build the right, but wish thinking and maybe kick Q3 is better to use my stones to fight and white not so easy to settle?]
;W[np];B[oo];W[mq];B[pq];W[or];B[nn];W[pr];B[qr];W[kr]LB[io:B]
[iq:A]C[tapir: You are forcing White to live in good shape, not attacking it. Now there is no way to do anything about A-B.]
;B[pf];W[qh];B[qi];W[oh]
(;B[qg]LB[qg:4][oh:1][qh:3][qi:2]C[tapir: This simply feels wrong, as if you answered W1 with B2 and W3 with B4, thinking less about instant territory and more about good and bad exchanges would help you in my opinion.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[pg];B[qf];W[nf];B[rh];W[ne];B[nd];W[md];B[nc]
C[tapir: The whole sequence again looks more like forcing to live instead of attacking. Of course choices are limited after R13. Black gained a lot of territory as well, so maybe it wasn't that bad.]

(;B[lj];W[ki];B[ii]C[tapir: Hard to attack when you have to go back fixing your own weaknesses.]
;W[kj];B[lk];W[mn]
(;B[ln]C[tapir: You should start sacrificing stones. These stones are not important at all - and currently there is a fight going on between a not yet alive White group and your potentially weak center left group.]
;W[mm];B[mo];W[no];B[lm];W[ml];B[on];W[ll];B[kl];W[kk];B[mi]
;W[jl];B[km];W[ik]C[tapir: You probably spent some time reading the sequence starting with M6 to save your L3, L5 stones. Yet your success connected White and turned your center-left into a target for attack.]
;B[hj];W[lp];B[lo];W[lq];B[nk]C[Za: I think white is ahead largely at this point, I was being too submissive with too little fighting spirit? I hope you have comments and/or suggestions on how I could resist white more. Next white played on the shape point G11 and my moral was very low so I handled my group poorly and it died :( Therefore if you wish you can stop reviewing here. Thank you already for takin your time to look at my game.

tapir: It would have been a good moment to evaluate the position. How much are you behind and/or are you behind at all if your group is alive? I agree that overall some sequences looked submissive, but I believe the solution is not necessarily fighting spirit (maybe for R13, H17) but more solid defensive moves. E.g. defending solidly at F16 would have saved you several moves later, playing solidly at K9 instead of preemptively attacking at M10 would have kept your groups connected and White separated.]
