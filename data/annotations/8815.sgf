C[Hello there !

Iam Simon 1kyu (white), thanks for reviewing my game!

I would like to play a more territory based style, maybe you would like to add some alternatives and of course punish my overplays and mistakes.

Hi Simon, my name is Greg. I will preface all my comment with GC.

I don't have any overall big comments about the game. Most of my critique is about reading mistake, or direction of play, which is better handled at the mistake in the game.

Greg];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[pe]C[I dont want to give black a chinese opening.

GC: This is totally fine if you do not like playing against the Chinese opening.]
;B[nd];W[qc];B[qb];W[qd];B[rb]
(;W[qn]C[GC: This move is too far from the Q15 stones. At the moment, they are very weak without an extension around R11. Black should get good profit by attacking them, and as a consequence, be able to deal with the R6 stone efficiently. See variations.]
(;B[ql];W[qi];B[pn];W[dq]C[GC: In the end, the R6-R8 exchange ended up being good for you becuase R8 is misplaced. It should be at R9. The R6 also still has plenty of aji left over to use later.]
;B[qo]
(;W[jq]C[GC: For me it feels like the left is currently the biggest side right now, not the bottom. This is a good point for black to play, so you would like it instead, but your stones on the bottom seem a little flat. The K3 extension would be much better if you already have C5. See variations for my though on how i would play.]
;B[fc]
(;W[df]C[GC: After looking at what happened after this, and taking into account, you say you would prefer a territorial style, C14 seems much more approriate than D14.]
;B[jd];W[co];B[ch];W[cj];B[eh]
(;W[cg]C[Here I tried to established a more solid group without making black solid on the upper side. This move seems bad, dont see a good continuation after blacks reply.

GC: Yeah I see the point you are trying to make, but unfortunately, this doesn't actually make your group much stronger since the same weak points in your shape still exist. Normally one just play straight at F14. See variation.]
;B[bg];W[ej]C[GC: This seems big. It seems like the bottom is more important than the top.]
;B[dg];W[cf];B[ef];W[ee];B[bf];W[ff];B[eg];W[cc];B[gd];W[fe]
;B[gh];W[bi];B[bh];W[hf];B[ih];W[jf];B[le];W[gj];B[bd];W[bc]
;B[ce]C[GC: And now the bad shape from playing C13 hits you hard. You learn the lesson of "If you don't see a good move to play in an area, then don't play there. Go elsewhere".]
;W[ec];B[de];W[hc];B[hd];W[fb]
(;B[fd]C[GC: I think this was a big mistake for black.];W[gb]
;B[ed];W[id];B[ie];W[ic];B[he];W[je];B[if];W[kd];B[jg]
(;W[oc]C[Overplay, maybe just playing O3 or R13?

GC: At this stage, your biggest asset is you bottom left moyo. R13 is not a very important point since the R8 stone is misplaced, and he still has the P17 weakness. O3 focuses on territory, whereas the moyo is far larger. K3 seems like the most important place to play right now.]
;B[od]
(;W[mc]C[GC: If you are going to sacrifice the P17 stone, you might as well play Q16 as a forcing move first. Your shape is tronger afterwards.]
;B[pd]
(;W[qf]C[GC: Connecting solidly seems better. It doesn't give black S16.]
;B[rd];W[ob];B[rc];W[qe];B[pb];W[oi];B[kf];W[jc];B[og];W[pg]
;B[oh];W[ph];B[ni]C[GC: A double hane here seems more approriately. Black's shape is not great here.]
(;W[oj];B[nj];W[ok];B[nk]
(;W[ol]C[GC: At this point, I would have gone elsewhere. The P10-8 group of stones doesn't gain white that much. It is not that important of a cut, and it isn't really gaining or eliminating too many points. K5 still seems huge to me.]
;B[hq]
(;W[nq]C[GC: Too far. When fighting, you should keep yourself as strong as possible. The M3 weakness will hurt.]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fq];W[lp]C[GC: If O3 were at N3, you could have no played D2, which is enormous.]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[fp]
(;W[fo]C[GC: Playing the double hane here seems a little thin. Better to play solidy at E5.]
;B[go];W[fn];B[gn];W[fm];B[gm];W[fl]
(;B[or]C[Was a little bit angry that black got this move. Dont see any agi of the R6 Stone and the corner seems solid for black.

GC: Black should play C2 before this. The sente there is huge. However, P2 is remains a big problem. Your group feels constricted. I probably would have just jump out first though. The game seems pretty close right now.]

;W[cr]C[misread, thought its sente

GC: Even if it isn't sente, this move is huge and to me still seems correct. This is my last comment.]
