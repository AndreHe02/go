;B[dp]C[Just know that im not a pro so you dont get optimal choices here but i try to explain the ideas behind my turn choices
I think your play is considerate and you can quickly jump to k16 if you apply some general rules 

In general:

1.A lot of both of your moves are to slow as i will state also tons of times later 
by that i mean playing one stone next to the other where you should go for board influence and spread them out
Often the smallest move you should to is the horse jump
Knowing when its possible to answer and when you should rather go for influence is a crucial step in go. The understanding of that would lift you at least by 10 ranks


2.As soon as you get two eyes in a group its save. if the oponent invades hes donating you a turn to go for influence 
i illustrated that in the path 2 

3When atacking a group. It is very seldom usefull to directly atack it. Rather do horsejumps around the group without touching it. 


I hope my comments helped you and you have a good time playing go. 

For more questions you can email me under bela.jugel@gmail.com and tell me your progress. 

All the best. Bela]
(;W[dd];B[pd];W[pp];B[ci];W[ce]C[Is this an ok enclosure?
Im no Pro but i can say its definitely ok. 
C15 aswell as B 16 are defensive but ensure the corner 

i think more agressive on c 14 is also ok];B[oc];W[ic];B[nq]
;W[pr]C[Was this an ok enclosure? Should I perhaps of played Q3 instead?

Q2 is definitely better. Q3 is way to slow and accomplishes nothing]
;B[pq];W[qq]C[I'm not sure about this move, either. I feel like maybe I should have cut at P3 instead.

i think i would have gone with P3. to punish his bad move but your secure move is ok.]
;B[oq]
(;W[or]C[That is definitely a mistake
you have to strengthen your group thats true but also cover the area! 

Q5 would be my choice];B[cm]
(;W[kp]C[This stone has no friends

very agressive and not really playing along the edges. would rather do something like 
Q10 R9 since it goes for teritory];B[kc]
(;W[jc]C[If you can help it dont touch the enemies stones];B[kd]
C[not an atack move]
(;W[jd]C[way to slow again you dont need huge groups that do nothing

also nearly always the triangle your stones have are a bad shape since they have less freedoms and cover a low area]
;B[qo];W[qp];B[qn];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[op];W[oo];B[lq];W[lp]
;B[mc];W[mr]C[bad choice gets less and i think your group is already secure]
;B[lr]C[he puhishes you];W[nr]C[jap very slow he has influence outwards]
;B[ls]C[total mistake by him here

without watching further i guess you could have gotten him]

(;W[qr]C[not neccesary i guess to slow];B[po]C[go for his group now yours is way stronger with 8 free spots]

(;W[rq];B[no];W[on];B[nn];W[om];B[nm];W[ol]C[previous sequence is very good for you his group around R5 is very weak]
;B[gq]
(;W[kr]C[I thought that I could play a sort of net here and stop black from going anywhere, but I think I should probably have played L3 instead. This move proved not to work to well.

as done 3 times before K2 is your play of choice];B[kq];W[jr]
C[This is why I didn't like the move, because then I found myself making the decision between probably losing a stone and providing black with an eye, or trying to save my stone. I opted for saving the stone, but I feel I could definitely have avoided this conflict.

The saving was totally a wrong choice this stone is essentially lost 
i dont know how it continues but if you go for this stone and manage to save it he gets tons of outwards influence in return]
;B[jq];W[iq];B[jp]C[now your in a hell of trouble because you wanted to save one stone]
;W[jo];B[ip];W[ir]C[just guessing you will lose at least one if now both groups here if i was him id go L5 next]

(;B[jn]C[i guess thats to weak from him with L5 he would have you]
;W[ko]
(;B[jm];W[io];B[hp];W[ml]C[he has to connect his groups here than he essentially wins still over your group around L4 i think]

(;B[nl];W[nk];B[in];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[kn];W[mo]C[you win because he made the mistake of not trying to connect hes groups congrants you won a lot here]
;B[qh]
(;W[sq]C[huge mistake. generally never play on the edge and his gruop around r 2 was already dead securing two ees wouls also be s 1 not this one]
;B[qf]
(;W[qs]C[second mistake since still way to slow];B[gc]C[Hes so asking for trouble here i think you could punish him]
;W[ss]C[stop that your group lives alredy if he attacks by eyther playing o or p 1

u have to react to G 17 here];B[cg];W[rr]C[The last few moves, I think I spent too much time worrying about eyes in the corner and allowed black too many moves to reinforce his own territory and then attempt to threaten my own. Should I have left the eyes for later on?

totally right you lost like 30 points in the last 3 moves]
(;B[qc]C[slow by him but i guess secure and ok 
my alternatives i would propably hav played here:];W[ec]C[finally you react and its ok but your group around k 17 is still a bit weak 

still not a bad choice here];B[ql]C[jap and he secures the grou you could still have killed]
;W[qm]
(;B[rn]C[or not];W[rm];B[rp];W[pm];B[ro];W[sm];B[sn];W[pn];B[qk]
;W[sp]
(;B[cn]C[he wants to ensure the corner but i thik if he wants that c 5 would have been better 

also still there is a lot of territory he could grap right now like shown in the other otpions]
;W[ho];B[cc];W[bc]
(;B[cb];W[bb];B[dq];W[db]C[The previous i have no idea what would have been the right things i think you focused to much on the corner 

maybe];B[da]C[mistake by him];W[ea];B[ca];W[eb]C[not neccesary]

(;B[co]C[hes way to secure like several times stated before go big here the edges are secure]

(;W[cd]C[ you have the group already you hould aldso go big and try to limit his center influence]
;B[ck];W[ba];B[nb];W[dc]C[I feel like maybe I should have left this capture for later on in the game, instead of wasting a move.

yes definitely];B[cq]C[hes still playing super slow hes huge wall on the left side just cries for using that midboard influence and hes oversecuring his corner]
;W[hq]C[im not shure about this move 

seemed to have worked ro you though];B[gp];W[gr];B[pi]C[hes still very slow with all his influence]
;W[pj];B[ph]C[wow he just gave you 10 points];W[qj]C[good job]

(;B[rd];W[rj]C[maybe unnecesarry if you want to be a pro later on right now i guess ok]
;B[dh]C[so slow he could have 50 more points if he left out all the slow movements]
;W[be]C[same goes for you there should be at least 5 stones in the middle already]
;B[lb]C[slow];W[hb]C[not slow but going to the middle is better here]
;B[hc];W[gb];B[hd]
(;W[ib]
(;B[bp];W[fb];B[bl];W[go]C[jump in the middle boys dont play slow moves]
;B[fq];W[eq]C[I wanted to cut black off, but it was a really bad move.

rather a minor mistake that cost you like 7 points but its true it was not neccesary

again big moves that acomplish board rather than slow connecting]
;B[er];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[fp]LB[hs:1]
(;W[gs]C[rather go H1 here that already ensures 2 eyes and spares 1 move]
;B[do];W[ks];B[dl];W[is]C[again your 2 eyes are secure already. you can play j1 or h2 if he invades

not neccesary];B[rg];W[rh];B[qg];W[ri];B[bj];W[hf]LB[if:1]C[finally agressive mid oriented. not perfect move here but you accomplish action and you get an advantage because you started it 
good job

here a bit better would be a horse jump to 1 i guess];B[fs]

(;W[hr]C[and for that you shoulb be beatan 5 times];B[bf];W[fd]
C[thinking to small];B[ae];W[ad];B[af];W[ie];B[cf];W[df];B[fr]
;W[ms]C[just to note it again in like every turn you go for 1 or two edge points when the whole 30 or more midpoints you would get by placing one stone mid are still open]
;B[os];W[ps]C[alos uneccesary if you have 2 eyes let him do his stuff and ignore it]
;B[bh];W[ge]LB[ff:1][fg:2]TR[lg][jj][gl]C[rather atack on a big scale if you wanna ensure the capture

the group was already almost dead and by saving it he would have given you lots of influence outside so triangle moves are better]
;B[dj];W[ff]C[rewatch the whole thing and try realize that your both doing very small moves all times]
;B[nd];W[og];B[br];W[oh];B[qe];W[kh]C[goooooood];B[jb];W[ja]
C[small again];B[kb];W[ia];B[ga];W[ha]C[said once before the previous move of him should totally be ignored he just gave you 1 point and a free move and by this your giving the same things back]
;B[ka];W[mg];B[sh];W[rk];B[sg];W[ne];B[of];W[me];B[md];W[ke]
;B[le];W[mf];B[pg];W[nf];B[oe];W[oi];B[pb]TR[hi][jk]C[the whole 20 last steps where very good for you since he won nothing and was too scared and you just wone midgame control 

2 triangles and you get 30 points];W[si]C[slow and small again]
;B[rb];W[gl];B[em];W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[ek];W[jl];B[lm]TR[am]
[cs]C[wow 50 turns before he totally had the upper hand against you but now i think you can actually win just because you did 2 or 3 big moves before he did and he did always slow small defensive moves like
 the triangle ones];W[ll];B[hm];W[hl];B[im];W[il];B[km]TR[gi]
C[Just an example again. if you do g 11 now you get the jackpot and his group is already dead by far . No eyes and no possibliity to get out]
;W[kl];B[eg];W[ef];B[dg];W[hn];B[ei];W[fg];B[fj];W[fi];B[gk]
;W[gj]C[This was also a bad move. Black plays at G11 and I'm left with choosing which stone I want to live. Maybe I should have left the decision til later in the game though?]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[hj];W[ij]C[you let him in im sad but i guess you still have won closely]

;B[ok];W[oj];B[mk]CR[lf]C[The only important point that is left here is M14 else i think the next turns you can pass and let him donate you more stones 

by playing in your territory yourselve your substracting yourselve some points again that he donates but ofcourse in the beginning better save than sorry so no worries youll master that later]

The only problem I saw here is that I didn't have a stone placed at M14, so that made the computer think that all of the space was neutral ground, and I'm not totally sure if it really was or not, but I could have avoided any questions about it by playing M14. Otherwise, I look forward to your overall comments on the game. Thanks!
