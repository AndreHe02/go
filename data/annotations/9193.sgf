[bravani\]:
This is a commented review by bravani 7k.
as usual, i have to say that no-one can tell the truth about go, let apart a 7kyu. I'll try to do my best reviewing this game.

Another imposrtant note: when i propose different variations, keep in mind that these are intended to exemplify some kind of strategy, or some general remark. They are not intended as the "best follow-up for the given situation". i'm not so strong to give this kind of commentary...

My comments will be denoted with the tag [bravani\]

Let's start!];B[pd];W[pq]C[[bravani\]: I don't like this move by white. I would have played in the opposite corner (say around D4). See later for a motivation of this comment.]
;B[dd];W[cp]
(;B[jd]C[[bravani\]: san ren sei is always a solid choise. In this situation a more agressive alternative is to exploit the not-so-good move by white (Q3)]

(;W[od]C[[bravani\]: i don't understand this move by white. I don't see the need to go against the enemy like this.]
;B[oe];W[nd];B[pc];W[kd];B[ke];W[kc];B[le];W[jc];B[id];W[ic]
;B[dj]MA[je][pe]C[[bravani\]: black is playing for "influence" towards the center. this may work. it is important not to forget about the cutting point (marked with X). They can become dangerous in the near future.]

(;W[de]C[[bravani\]: Another attachment i don't like very much. I think White should use its group on the top as a launching point for this kind of move (see variation)]
;B[ee];W[ed]C[[bravani\]: i like this crosscut by White.];B[fd]
C[[bravani\]: there is a prover that say: when crosscutted, never atari. Maybe Black should have extended here. But i never want to take proverbs too litterally. let us see what happens next.]
;W[ec];B[fe]C[[bravani\]: good move by Black. solid connection.]

;W[ea];B[bd];W[ca]TR[de]MA[pj][jp][jq][iq][ip][pk][qk][qj][qi]
[pi][eq][po]C[[bravani\]: this is too early for those end-game moves. Ok, this menaces a double atari, but there is a lot of empty space in the other zones. If i was white, i would have played elsewhere (tenuki), or i would have tried to do some harm to Black by using the marked stone in D15.

remember: as soon as a local situation is settled in a satisfatory way (this means that "my groups cannot be severely attacked in only one move, and i cannot severely attack in one move", roughly speaking), one should consider taking some big points on the board.

Look at the whole board. 70% of the goban is still in full opening. Any move on the marked spots would be worth a lot of points. Much more than the number of point one would reasonably get from local moves like the last ones.]

(;B[cd]C[[bravani\]: bad answer.];W[bb];B[df]
(;W[cc]C[[bravani\]: White should not waste his moves gaining so few points. he should look at the big picture!]
;B[bc]
(;W[cb]C[[bravani\]: both players are wasting their time! These are moves that have so little influence on the final score that one should not play them unless some group needs them for living. 
Here the groups are living, so keep those moves for the endgame.



Black here should not forget that there is some potential for White here (see variations)]
;B[ep]C[[bravani\]: yeah! this is the kind of move i was waiting by Black .]
;W[eq]
(;B[co]C[[bravani\]: i never saw this kind of move. It seems to be considered a bad move. (courtesy of Josekipedia)
Well, it is still not time for you for studying joseky (they say, do not study joseki until you are a single digit skyu... well, roughly speaking this makes sense).

the general principle is, in my opinion, the following.
"if i don't know the relative effectiveness of a set of alternative moves, i usually choose the one that keeps myself connected, and possibly, that disconnectes the other player's groups.]

;W[qp];B[pn]C[[bravani\]: Ok, i like this solid joseki in the bottom right corner.]

(;W[pj]C[[bravani\]: good idea for white. the only problem is that...


(see variations)];B[ph]MA[pk][pl][pm]C[[bravani\]: this is a good answer and white has not the space for a solid base...]

(;W[qh];B[qg];W[rh];B[rg];W[ql];B[qi]
(;W[pi]C[[bravani\]: this move allows black to capure the two stones (as in fact happens). this is not a tragedy, but then white will not have the space for a solid base.]
;B[ri];W[qj];B[oh];W[rj]C[[bravani\]: i'd rather run in the center, here]
;B[sh]
(;W[oc]C[[bravani\]: uhm.... empy triangle by White.];B[ne]
;W[ld]C[[bravani\]: not so urgent, i think...



Anyway, a little reasonement here:
look at the following three moves. then go back here.


did it? Let's see what happened.
in this situation Black has to move. The "local situation" around N15 is pretty much settled (let's ignore the cutting points H16 and K15 i mentioned in a variation before). 
black can do what he wants. he must not answer any immediate menace. he could defend some weak points in his structure, or attack some weak white group (for example the one at the right side).
In go language, we say that Black has the initiative (the "SENTE")

a move is called sente (here "sente" is an adjective) if it allows the player to keep (or gain) the initiative. let's see what happens]
;B[md]C[[bravani\]: black tries this move];W[mc]C[[bravani\]: obvious answer]
;B[me]C[[bravani\]: Black defends. 


What happened?
the situation is almost identical as before, but now it's white turn. Black has lost the initiative.

A move which is the opposite of a sente move is a "gote" move. One should not play gote moves unless they are useful for saving a group or something important like that. Playing a gote sequence to pacely settle up some boundary like this is a waste of time.

this is the kind of reasonmente that one learns very slowly, step by step. it is totally natural not to have this kind of view from the beginning.
probably a 3dan thinks the same of a 3kyu, and a 3kyu about a 7kyu, naturally on a different level...

go is a difficult game!];W[ob];B[pb]C[[bravani\]: those are end-game moves. the big points are in the center and in the lower side.
The players must urge to play there! (or to attack/defend important gropus etc)]
;W[ac]

;W[gj];B[gi];W[fj];B[eg]C[[bravani\]:  those two stones are not so dangerous. i would have played something like G8 or some other eye-killing move



Wrong rule of thumb: "the most stones a group is made of, the most powerful it is"
better rule of thumb: "the most 'eyeshapes' a group has, the most powerful it is. ONCE a group has two eyes, then its dimension matters"


So, as long as the enemy weak groups do not menace your groups, its dimension should not scare you.

In theory, one should encourage desperate invasions like this one, answering only when needed, and playing elsewhere in the borad (or passing) otherwise.
Each move the enemy makes in your territory and you do not answer, its a point for you at the end. Do not understimate your opponent and always answer if you are not sure, because you can regret an excessive faith in yourself!]

General considerations.


i think this is a good game for your level. The main problem is that most of the moves are still redundant and not urgent. A good go player should always make the most efficient move. This is an impossible task, but one should alwasy try. 
I pointed out a couple of examples of moves that were played but were not urgent at all.  There were a lot of others but i could not point out every such move. 

The general attitude one should have, in my opinion, is the following.

Always ask yourself "what am i trying to accomplish?"  "is this move really better than doing nothing?"  "is there some urgent move i should make? if not, is there some big point i can conquer?"

see the big picture. As soon as a local situation is stabilized, claim some big void area.

In this game there were not big fights for the life or death of a group, but some interesting situation arised.

Black made a couple of unhappy blunders at the top, losing a good amount of stones (and territory!). Well, this happens and it is one of the most useful (yes unpleasant) ways to improve. Learn from errors. Also, black did not try to chase (and maybe kill) the weak white group in the right side. this may have been a good opportunity to make some other territory or to capturing some stones (which is always perversely satisfying, eheh).

On the other hand, white did not invade black's mojo until the very last moves (also, he did not use the fact to having opened a breach to do massive damage), which allowed black to do a whole lot of territory in the center.

Anyway, keep up the good work and i hope my comment will be useful!
