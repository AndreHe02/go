C[

The start of my game with Paul Margetts. We both " lost" and
"won" the game several times and I finally sneaked home
with an end-game rip-off.];B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[eq];W[ci]
C[
Q: is it good for W to allow B two shimaris?

reid:  Well, I'm sure you can find lots of pro games with w c11 or c10
in this position, so I don't think w has anything to feel bad about.
If w approaches at c15 or c14 instead of c11, a black pincer around
c13/c12 does good things for black's lower shimari (although there
are pro games with those moves too).];B[ce]C[
reid: Black could also consider c13 here. Also, approaching from the
other side at c9 is worth considering.];W[cl];B[mc]C[
reid: we almost never see this approach to the 4-4 point because the
white response at p17 is just too good for white.];W[jc]C[
I found this a difficult move to counter.

Q: What plan should B have?

reid: Hmm, black seems to have three basic choices here: run out,
counter-pincer, or do something in the corner.

In the corner, it looks like q18, q17, and r17 are all possible - too
many choices, so perhaps better to leave it for later.

Running out lets white stabilize with g17 - perhaps too passive?
Also, white can't surround in one move, so no need to run yet.

So black's choice to pincer looks reasonable.];B[hc];W[hd];B[gc]
;W[id]C[
I thought that this was not a bad result for B,
provided 9 can be settled lightly and there's
some chance of building an attack on the 3 W
stones.

Q: was this analysis right? If so, should W have
Done something else? Maybe just a one point
jump instead of attaching?

reid: Well, I agree with the over-all analysis, except for the  "lightly" part :-)  Lightly implies that living somewhere around n17
is your main goal, and I think the "attacking" part of your analysis
should be your main goal (but then, that's just the kind of player I
am :-)

See next move for more...];B[mf]C[
reid:  This certainly succeeds in running out lightly, but because
it's light, it doesn't really attack the j16 group very strongly -
there are too many forcing moves available to white.

I am always on the lookout for a double attack, because that's how you
can essentially get two moves value out of each move.  Here I would
probably try a second approach on the corner with r14.  If white tries
to run out, then black runs his n17 stone out too, and a splitting
attack starts to form.  Also, white can't get the corner anymore since
it's undercut on both sides.

It's actually very difficult for white to kill the n17 stone right
now, so it just feels a bit too defensive to run out with it now.]
;W[pf]C[
reid: this looks very good for white.  Now the two black stones have
very little chance of making any significant territory, and because
they are a bit weaker than the white j16 group, there is little chance
that black can kill them.];B[qc]C[
I'm still in two minds about this move.

Q) Is it premature? I'm concerned that W could
very soon take a large corner/side. So If I
take the coner now I leave him with the problem
of making sense of his thickness, and 15  should be well placed to make that diffiicult.

reid: But white's natural response splits the two black groups, making
the n17/n14 pair very weak.  That means the j16 group is stronger, so
black will be too busy defending to have time to think about
attacking.];W[pc];B[pb];W[ob];B[qb];W[nc]C[
reid: Ouch.  That hurts!];B[re];W[qg]C[
reid: Hmm, white knows that the black corner is alive already, so
r13 looks too slow.  How about attacking the whole black group with
something like l13?  The white q17 group has no fear as long as n18 is
available.];B[jf]C[
I think I'm happy to let W spend a move capturing  9, and if he doesn't then he's likely not to get much
territory in the area.

reid: Yes, but he hasn't spent that move yet,  The white groups look a
bit stronger than black now, so I thiuk white has an advantage in the
game at the moment (even though black is ahead in territory)  The
black formation seems to have a bad weakness at m15.];W[hf]
;B[qn]C[
On review this looks risky, I don't want W to
lean on this stone and hence get a large scale attack  on the 3 stones at the top.

Q: What's best here?

reid:  I agree, this is risky.  Having two weak groups on the board
should be enough to lose, in most cases.

If I were white, I'd do it the other way: lean on k14/n14 to pick off
r6.  White j12 looks like a very nice point for white to get now - his
stones are really working together,];W[ql]C[
reid: This feels like the wrong direction:  because of black s15,
the right side is small.  White wants to maintain blacks status of two
weak groups.  I think attacking the larger group is a better strategy.]
;B[on];W[np];B[pk]C[
reid:  Arghh!  now the black stones start to work together.  This is
not what white wanted.];W[pl];B[ol];W[qk]LB[qk:A]MA[om][ok]
C[
We both thought that this idea was right for B.
Getting some thickness restores balance to the
game and should ensure that W can't do too much
damage at the top.
However I wonder what the right move is for
B now. Seems that playing one of the two triangled
points might be more useful here.];B[pj]C[
reid: No, I think the normal joseki move here is best for black.
Basically, it's free because white needs to respond at r10, which is
reduced in value because of s15.

And I disagree about the balance - black was way ahead in territory,
but way behind in thickness (because of the negative value of his n14
group).  Now black has caught up in thickness, but w has no territory.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[om];B[nm];W[pm];B[nl];W[pn]C[
Pretty much according to plan except that it feels like  B conceded
too much territory here.

reid: Well, it might appear that way, but black can still live in this
corner.  b r3 is the obvious starting  place, and white needs to block
on the q3 side at which point, b s2 is the magic move.

And white has not connected r10 to the q14 group, so a move like l17
has some significance now.];B[lq]C[
Hasty. I think this is one of the "losing" moves.
A move which links 37 and 15 would be better.

reid: Yes, this move is only considering territory, and isn't taking
the strength and weakness of all the groups into account.];W[ng]
C[
Pounce!];B[jh]C[
reid:  This response feels a bit "soft".  The fighting reaction
would be to push back at n13.  If w o12, b m11 looks good.  Black
still wants to be thinking about seperating k17 from o17.];W[mg]
;B[lf]C[
reid: Uh-oh.  Suddenly white has a splitting attack going!]
;W[nj];B[nk]C[
reid: I think n10 would be a bit better.  Black should be willing to
sacrifice the three q10 stones in exchange for central thickness. o9
commits black to saving them.];W[lj]C[
reid: Nice shape, nice sequence for white.];B[mo];W[jj];B[hg]
C[
reid: Black is struggling.];W[mb]C[
I was very glad to see this , I thought that the
B stones were under a lot of pressure. Does
W need to play this way?

reid: No!  White should certainly hane at g13!  White is giving up his
chance for a quick victory1];B[gf];W[if];B[ig];W[jq];B[hq]C[
Both 58 and 59 feel like overplays.
Q: alternatives?

reid:  I think I'd call k3 a missed opportunity rather than an
overplay.  What happens if white pushes and cuts instead (w n4, b m4,
w m5)?

Because of that, I think b perhaps should have played l5 instead of
h3.];W[ko];B[lp]C[
A little panic setting in now ;-) Don't think
we really have two eyes?

reid: The o7 group?  No, I think it's in big trouble :-)  For that
reason, n4 is better than m4 (when given a choice, always pick a move
that reduces his liberties)];W[hp];B[nr];W[pr];B[jr]C[
But 62 seems to allow an easy connection?

reid: Really? what if white plays l2 now? How does black connect?
White can probably run out, but he won't get much territory, mwanwile,
white is ripping off the bottom and reducing the corner.];W[gg]
C[
I think now B is ahead on territory so W has to
make something from attacking this group if
he is to win.

reid: Hmm, I think white is leaving the scene of the battle.  White l2
looks severe.  White will have time to play g13 later, when the o8
group dust has settled.];B[gh];W[fg];B[hi]C[
Bad, should be one point to the right.];W[ff];B[ei];W[dj];B[lg]
C[
This was meant to make eye shape while
threatening to cut.];W[cn]C[
This seemed slow to me];B[iq]C[
Iwas concerned that White would have played
in this area and end up with something substantial
in the centre as he probably has forcing moves
against the top group too.

My plan was to attack some or all of 58 60 and 62
and 52 50 and 48 and hence stop W building anything
big. I reckon I'm ahead on territory at this point.

reid: I agree with all that.  White missed l2.];W[ip];B[mh]
;W[gq]C[
This seems a good way of telling me that 77 was
played too soon.

Q:  77 at 78 would be better?];B[jp];W[gp]C[
At this time, should B extend up from 79?

I thought that the corner looked too weak.];B[bo]C[
reid: I agree, the corner looks weak, but I would probably play at
e5 instead of b5, just to keep white busy in the center, and to help
the h11 stones.  However, there's no doubt that b5 is very large.]
;W[jo];B[kp]C[
I felt that W has done well here.

Unfortunately our game record stopped here.

In the end I did attack the W group but failed to
press home an advantage and W lived in
seki while building quite a substantial centre
to get ahead on territory.

reid:  It looks like b is well ahead:  white's lower right is perhaps
a bit larger than  black's upper left (black f16 and b12 are probably
sente, and black p2 and r11 are significant reductions), but white has
nothing to match black's other two corners.  Black just needs to wrap
the game up - nothing fancy.

Overall, I think white needs to work on his follow-through.  In this
game white lost several opportunities because he didn't continue to
press his advantage (n18 instead of g13 and g13 instead of l2).
However, white did well with the splitting attack at m10 and j10.
Black should take note of the effectiveness of this attack.

Both players can work on evaluating the strategic positions of the
early middlegame position, paying particular attention to the strength
and weakness of each group.  I think you'll make significant advances
when you start to work the strengths and weaknesses against each other
to accomplish strategic goals.

My advice would be to stop thinking about territory for perhaps 20
games and just play an attack/defense game to see where it takes you.
Think about killing his dragon with each move :-) You'll probably lose
a bunch of games to start with, but once you get the hang of it,
you'll find it's a lot of fun to play that way, and your fighting
skills will improve rapidly.

Good luck, play strong!
