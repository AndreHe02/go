AB[dd][pd][dp]C[Dear Reviewer.
I'm playing black in this game with 3 stones handicap.
I'm not very strong, but I thought I did okay in the opening and the early middle game. But after move 56 everything went wrong, and I would like to know what expecially were my mistakes.

I hope you can help me.

[SC\] Hello! Most of my comments will be marked with [SC\].

My email is below if you have any questions or want to go over a part of the game in more depth.  I hope this review is useful for you!

P.S. Sorry for the lateness, I have been having internet problems and could not send it until today]
;W[pp];B[dj];W[fc]
(;B[eb]LB[ec:A][hc:B][df:C]C[[SC\] This move is ok, but usually a move at A B or C is played.  See variations.]
;W[fb];B[dg]LB[ec:A][jd:B]C[[SC\] This is a good move, but it would be more natural to defend the corner first at A.  White would then extend from his two stones to B]
;W[ec];B[dc];W[db];B[cb];W[ea]
(;B[bc]LB[qn:C][jp:A][nq:B]C[[SC\] This move is not needed, and is very small.  Black has much bigger moves at A B and C.  See variation.]
;W[jd];B[og]CR[mc][nc][md][nd][pf][qf][pg][qg]LB[jp:A]TR[dg]
[dj][dp]C[[SC\] This move neither makes territory nor creates good influence.  If you wanted to extend from the corner stone it is best to do so along the 3rd or 4th line (some examples shown by circles)

However I feel a move at A is in the right direction, as it would work well with the marked stones and give black influence and territory]
;W[nc]
(;B[oe]LB[oc:A][pn:B]C[[SC\] Blacks stones are overconcentrated, and are not working efficiently.  In response to white's move it would be better to either defend the corner at A or approach the other corner with B.

However, neither A or B work efficiently due to blacks previous move.  See variations for more info.]
;W[pc];B[qc]C[[SC\] The right move.];W[pb];B[qe]LB[pl:A][jp:B]
C[[SC\] This removes blacks aji but I think black has other priorities such as A or B]
;W[qb]
(;B[rc]LB[pl:A][pn:B]TR[pd][oe][qe][og]C[[SC\] This is too submissive.  The points black gains from defending here are much smaller than taking up a big point on the board.

In particular black would want to use his strong shape at the top and take the right hand side with A or make an approach move at B.

See variation];W[pj]C[[SC\] White strikes at blacks underbelly..]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[oi];B[oj]C[[SC\] White could fight with A, but would lead to a very complicated fight and the result is unclear (though I think black is favourite here)]
;W[pm];B[nj]C[[SC\] A necessary move.];W[me];B[mf]LB[jp:A]TR[dg]
[dj][nj][oj][dp]C[[SC\] This is a small move from white and should be ignored.  If black were to play A instead he would create a large sphere of influence with the marked stones and take the lead.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[lf];B[mg];W[nd];B[hd]
(;W[ld]
(;B[ie]LB[hb:A]C[[SC\] If black were to play A, the white stones would be in major trouble.]
;W[hc];B[fe]TR[ea][db][fb][ec][fc][hc]C[[SC\] I like this move, as it confines the marked stones to the side, which is advantageous to black]
;W[jf];B[if]LB[jp:A]C[[SC\] A small move.  Again, K4 is the important point.]
;W[id];B[gd];W[jg];B[ih];W[ig];B[hg];W[fq]
(;B[hq]LB[fp:A]C[[SC\] I would have rather played A as this creates something of a moyo.  See variation.]
;W[cq]C[[SC\] Big mistake from white.  Black can now confine her to the corner and make a large moyo in the process.]
;B[cp];W[dq]
(;B[gp]C[Should I have played E4 here?

[SC\] Yes.  The standard joseki is shown in the variation];W[ep]
;B[eo];W[bp];B[co]C[Was that a mistake?

[SC\] This is probably blacks best answer.  The mistake comes later on.]
;W[bo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm]
(;W[dl]
(;B[el]C[[SC\] The mistake is here -  Black is too weak to think about killing this stone outright]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]
(;B[bk]C[Should I have played E6 here?

[SC\] Yes, E6 is the safest move and saves black a lot of complications.  See variation]
;W[dn];B[em];W[do];B[en];W[ij]LB[jh:A]TR[jf][ig][jg]C[[SC\] White threatens to link up with the marked stones.  A is the most straightforward way to deal with this.  
See variation after 76 to see how white can connect];B[hj]
(;W[im]LB[hk:A][lp:B]C[[SC\] White tries to make eyespace rather than connect - possibly because he missed it.  Either way it is going to be very hard to kill white outright.

First, I would defend blacks weakness with A, which white must defend against.
Then I would take territory along the bottom with B.  See variation]

(;B[hm];W[il];B[nm]TR[hj][hm]C[[SC\] A good idea threatening to cut off white, but black has weaknesses on the left he needs to attend.]
;W[pq];B[km];W[kk];B[li];W[ki];B[oo]LB[kp:A]C[[SC\] There is still territory at the bottom to be contested.  A would be a nice point to take]
;W[po];B[gc];W[hb];B[ol];W[pl];B[ii];W[ik];B[hk];W[hl];B[kh]
C[G8 here?

[SC\] If you have faith in your life and death skills then this is a good move, as it cuts white off from her allies.  It is possible to kill white but the variations are complex so i wont include them]
;W[lg];B[ji];W[kj];B[lh];W[jh]
(;B[hh]C[[SC\] Not a necessary move];W[hn]LB[gm:A]TR[ki][ij]
[kj][ik][kk][hl][il][im]C[[SC\] Black can ignore this move and still kill white BUT it would have been much easier by simply responding with G7.  I have lost many games I should have won by ignoring similar moves]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[rj]LB[kp:A]C[[SC\] This move is small and ends in gote, so is a move best saved for the endgame.  Black has bigger priorities such as taking profit at the bottom.]
;W[rk];B[si];W[ok];B[nk];W[on];B[nn];W[no];B[mo];W[np];B[mp]
;W[gm];B[fl]LB[ek:B][fo:A]TR[el][dm][em][en][eo]C[Shoul I have played somewhere else here?

[SC\] I would prefer to connect the marked stones with either A or B as this saves a complex fight]
;W[fo]LB[fp:A]C[Cutting with A is the best and simplest way of dealing with this attempt to connect]

(;B[fn];W[go];B[ho];W[io];B[ip];W[hp];B[iq];W[gq];B[jo]C[[SC\] Probably the best black can do in such a position]
