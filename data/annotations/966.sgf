C[Hi.  I'm 'edgy' and I played White in this game.  I feel like I plyed OK except for some tactical mistakes, but that probably just means that I completely missed the strategic ones.

I've asked a few specific questions; I hope my marks and variations are readable to you (I've given co-ordinates for the marks just in case).


Comments by Nicolas Herubel (Nickarin 7k on IGS).];B[pp];W[dd]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[dn]LB[pj:a][fc:b]C[This move is maybe too early. Black should wait because there are several ways to approche this san-san stone. As it is low, it is not urgent to play around it.
I'd prefer playing 'a' or 'b'.]
(;W[qj]C[I 'd be tempted to answer as in var. But this is good too:)]

(;B[ic]LB[ep:a]C[B should take advantage of W tenuki by playing around 'a', as W will be confine in the corner. See var.]
;W[dj];B[iq]LB[ep:a]C[Letting W have F3 is a mistake.Should be at 'a'.]
;W[fq];B[dp];W[dq];B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[hq]C[Now, the J3 stone is damaged.]
;B[fj];W[el]C[Good splitting move!];B[fl]
(;W[em]C[But this one doesn't split! See var.];B[fm];W[en];B[fn]

(;W[do]LB[eo:a]C[Is 'a' (e5) better?

No. See var.];B[eo];W[co];B[ek];W[cm];B[dk];W[cl];B[ck]C[Now, YOU are split!!]
;W[dh]LB[ce:a]C[A fondamental of go is: "don't play near your opponent thickness" :)
If you are affraid of B getting too much territory here, just play 'a'.  Do you think that black will add a stone to capture D10 after you play 'a'?
Here, you give him TWO stones to attack.];B[cf];W[df];B[dg]
;W[eg]C[B should connect.];B[de];W[cg];B[ee];W[ce];B[cd];W[bf]
;B[dc]C[I think B gains a lot with this sequence...

But his D4 group is not so strong.];W[qf]C[You could also considere playing on the other side at O17.]
;B[nd];W[ip]C[An other fondamental: don't play near your force:)

May be O3 is better.];B[kq]C[As we saw before, there is now TWO stones to attack if you play O3.]
;W[jp]C[Here, you 'll reinforce B on both side...];B[kp];W[ko]
;B[lo];W[kn];B[in];W[ln]C[I felt I had done well the last few moves in neutralizing the influence of Black's wall and establishing some influence of my own.

Maybe, but in which direction does your influence works?];B[mo]
;W[nm];B[bd]LB[pn:a][qn:b]C[Yose move!
Should be around 'a' or 'b'.];W[mq];B[mp];W[qq];B[pq];W[qp]

C[Strange sequence, where finaly you DO have what you wanted!]
;B[qe];W[pf]LB[qh:a]C[Say thanks to B! Your weakness at 'a' has vanished!]
;B[oh];W[qh]C[Too submisive! You had construct a big influence, and now you refuse to make use of it :) Should be at O14.]

[al:c]MA[oh]C[I wonder if 'a' or 'b' (p10 or k8), trying to expand my moyo, were better than this.  I hoped to harrass the marked stone (p12), but instead I just seem to give Black a head start at getting into the center.

This is good: you drive B in your force.];B[cj];W[ch];B[mh]

(;W[nj]C[But now, you change your mind and try to make a territory:(
See var.];B[lj];W[jl];B[ll];W[mm];B[ok]C[B is trying too hard.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[pj];B[qi];W[ri];B[ng]C[You MUST answer at N14.]
;W[mk];B[of]C[Should simply be at N14];W[oe];B[og];W[pe]C[Connecting at O15 may be better. It will be hard for B to fight here.]
;B[ne]C[Here, you should push once at N14 to continue the splitting attack.]
;W[od];B[qc];W[pc];B[qd];W[nc];B[mf]C[Now, B has no more problems on the outside... But the corner seems dead!
See this var.]
(;W[lk];B[pb];W[oc];B[mc];W[kj];B[rj]
(;W[rk]LB[rh:a]C[Could I have gotten away with connecting at 'a' (s12)?  I knew I couldn't fight the ko that now arises, so maybe I could have avoided it that way.  (see variation)

You are right. The var is ok; B can't get away.];B[rh];W[sj]

You have at least a threat at N18.];W[pg];B[bn];W[bo];B[am]
;W[re];B[rd];W[sf];B[rb];W[kh]LB[li:a]C[I considered 'a' (m11) to catch a stone, but thought this was bigger.

I think N18 or G14 are bigger.];B[li];W[ki];B[kf];W[jg];B[jf]

(;W[hm]LB[gm:a][hn:b]MA[in]C[is this a mistake?  Can White play either 'a' or 'b' (g7 or h6) to try and surround the marked stone (j6)?
>From the variations, it doesn't look like it.

It's not so big to capture this stone anyway. Big moves are N18 or S2.]

Yes. You must play your sente moves first.];W[cf]
