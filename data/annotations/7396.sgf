AB[pd][dp]C[Hi my name is Brett Lee, and i played black in this game. I am not used to having a handcaps and it made me feel a little uncomfertable. I have been studying joseki for the lst couple days and felt ready to really play well. However when it came mid game i was rather shallow in my reading and by end game i made a huge mistake that cost me the game. I continued to play on in despiration burt was only wasting whites time. I should have resigned. Thank you so much for reviewing this game i hope i can learn a lot from your comments.

Brett Lee

[Calvin\] Hello.  I will try to make useful comments, but please keep in my that at only about 5k AGA / 3k IGS, so it is possible that some things I'm saying are wrong.

Summary: Black was ahead for much of the opening and due to white's overplays also had a decent lead in the middle game but lost a lot of points toward the end on reading mistakes and small moves.

Some proverbs and concepts to consider for future games:

1. Play away from thickness, both your own and your opponent's.  http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayAwayFromThickness

1.a. Don't be fooled by fake thickness.  Walls with a lot of cutting points are not very threatening.

2. Don't follow your opponent around.  If your opponent plays a small gote move, look around the board and try to find the biggest area.  At your level, your opponent may try to play a lot of endgame-like moves in the opening or middle game.  Try to learn their real values so you can decide whether something else is bigger than responding locally.

3. Study Attack and Defense.  At move 16 you had a great chance to attack.

4. Remember that it's hard to make a moyo if your opponent already has strong groups in that area of the board, and the area of influence of strong groups can be pretty big (even the whole board!).  You will also find it hard to build a moyo when your stones are on the third line, because they can be reduced from above.  This was not a moyo game, but that's okay.  It's okay to play for territory in a two-stone handicap game, but as the handicap increases, black has to use the existing handicap stones for influence more and more.

5. Improve your reading by studying life & death and tesuji problems.  This will not only help with those blunders like the ones that cost you this game (moves 44 and 162), but it wall also help with your judgement of all the previous points, because whether a group is weak or strong or whether a move is sente or gote is ultimately a matter of reading.

6. Remember to have fun!];W[dd]
(;B[pq]C[[Calvin\] See variation a moyo idea.];W[po];B[qo];W[qn]
;B[qp];W[pn]
(;B[mq]C[Should i have extended one more space to the right?

[Calvin\] The standard move here is O3.  This move is a little thin, but white might wait to later to punish it.  See variation.]
;W[qj]
(;B[nc]TR[dp][pd]MA[cq][qc]C[Was this to ear;y should i have played F3 instead? I know in a handicap game you are supposed to protect your lead not attack. This is why i focused more on moyo rather than attacking like i usually do.

[Calvin\]: Who told you that you shouldn't attack in a handicap game?  This is in fact the advice given in several standard books on handicap go.  It's mostly about using the stones that you already have in place.  The handicap stones (marked) are not placed well for territory.  In fact, they take no territory, because white can invade at the 3-3 points (X) at any time.

So at the beginning of a handicap game with traditional handicap stone placement:

Black's territory = White's territory
Black's influence > White's influence

When you play a move, you have to use it accordingly.

O17 is not a moyo move.  It is a territorial move.  See variation.   In fact, you already decided not to play a moyo game when you played R5!]
;W[qf];B[kc]TR[nc][pd]C[I think i should have played R or S 16 or was extending better?


[Calvin\] The marked formation is a good shape played often by professionals these days, but here it's a bit slow.  Actually, black should just tenuki.  R16 and S16 good to protect the corner, but don't just follow your opponent around in gote.]
;W[rd]
(;B[fc]SQ[kc][nc][pd]C[I extended to far here should have been H17 i think,or was this ok?

[Calvin\] The direction of play is wrong.  In general, you want to play away from strength.  Play away from your opponent's strength, and play away from your own strength as well.  Black has invested three stones at the top for a very solid position.  This part of the board is uninteresting now.  See variation.]
;W[hc]C[[Calvin\] White overplays, I think.]
(;B[cc]SQ[fc]C[[Calvin\] This is a sabaki move.  (It's a move for managing weak stones.) It treats the marked stone lightly.  It's the simplest variation and takes the corner, but I don't think it is severe enough on white because black has a lot of help here. See variation.]

(;W[cd]C[[Calvin\] Oh, white must block the other side!  See variation.]
;B[dc]
(;W[fd]SQ[dc][dd][fc]C[[Calvin\] White should have played E16 instead.  This move is thin.  In general, when the shape with the marked stones appears, the player who can wedge in first with E16 for black or E17 for white has an advantage.  See variation.]

(;B[bd]C[[Calvin\] Maybe just E17 first.  See variation.];W[be]
;B[bc];W[cf]C[I think the pincer turned out ok for me but he got a lot of center influence. are there any other variations i could have used?]

(;B[qc]C[This was bad but i had a bad feeling about his stone invading.

[Calvin\]  R17 is a big endgame move, but not necessary now. Where can white invade?  White's influence is not that great---black can neutralize it now by playing a move like C7 or create weaknesses in white's shape by playing E16.  See variations.]

(;W[rc]C[[Calvin\] A big endgame move--over 15 points---but gote.   See variation for white.]
;B[oe]C[I wanted to focus on the center here, was it the right move or should i have exteded off of L15?

[Calvin\] Unnecessary and gote.  White is not going to play here.]
;W[gd]C[[Calvin\] See, now white is thick.  It's slow, but probably honte (the honest move) for white.]
;B[gc]C[[Calvin\] This kind of move is bad shape.  It helps white.  I know black may be afraid of the life and death situation in the corner, but F18 would be a better shape here.  It's still not necessary.]
;W[hd];B[kf]C[[Calvin\] Adding a stone to a group that's already very strong.  It's very small.]
;W[cn]C[[Calvin\] This is the most open area of the board.]

(;B[eo]TR[mq]LB[jp:A]C[This is the diagonal correct? i thought it was a good move but now realize never to play it unless my stones are down futher. What variations could i have used here to better gain moyo in the center?

[Calvin\] Black can't make a moyo here.  First, white is already very strong, so it's too late.  Also, black's stone at N3 is an a low position on the third line, and so the bottom side is not as developable.  If black had a stone around A, this would be better, but still because of white's Q7 stones, there is little moyo potential.  See variations.]
;W[fq]C[[Calvin\] White overplays.]
(;B[hp]C[[Calvin\] Black can just take the corner.  See variation.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[cp]
(;B[cr]C[[Calvin\] Perhaps black has been hurt in the past by white's hane at D2 in this position, but I think it is better to press at D7 now.  See variation.]
;W[hq]
(;B[jq]C[[Calvin\]: I think G4 is better.  See variation.];W[gp]
;B[go];W[ip]C[I should have played H5 i dont know what i was thinking

[Calvin\] Yes, it makes a huge difference.];B[fp];W[ho]C[[Calvin\] This is a big success for white.  White is very strong here and now black has a weak group.  Black used to have a good lead, but now the game is getting closer.]

;B[fn];W[hn];B[fl];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[dj];W[cj];B[hl]C[[Calvin\] This is pretty big.  It could have been played earlier.]
;W[jm]
(;B[ig]C[all the moves after this i think are pretty bad and not thought through enough. I was playing for the center but my sotones didnt have life.

[Calvin\] The game is still close.  See variation.];W[di];B[ei]

[Calvin\] Black is winning.];B[fi];W[dl];B[el];W[fh]C[here i didnt know how to respond so i played A15 hoping he would respond and it would give me some time to think.

[Calvin\] You have to learn to play better byoyomi moves, then, because that's obviously a double-gote sequence. ;-)]
