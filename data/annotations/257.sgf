the stone at A but must play it at B instead.

[qh]C[This move is not so urgent, I think it is better to extend at F17 or G17,  or to split the left side at C10.]
;W[hc];B[jf]C[This move (K14) is a fleeing  move, but this group is not under attack. Is b wants to play here, it is  better to play H15 or H16, to build influence

But b can also split the left side (biggest move now)];W[qc]C[Now choosing  the side on which b should block is difficult, since he will end up over  concentrated on both sides]

;W[dj]C[W builds the left side and has taken the lead];B[fj]C[No purpose move, it will help w to stregthen its left side.  It would be better for b to play F6 (to alleviate the weakness at H3 and  build the lower side) or invade at C12 or C8]
;W[go];B[jn]C[Yet another no  purpose move. If b plays in this area, he should defend properly its F3 group  at H3]

(;B[ki]C[Now begins the long and losing struggle for b to try to build  territory with all this influence. He should aim at a cut at H8 to attack  either J9 group or G5 group. To prepare this, b should first build strength  on the left side by playing D11 and so on for example (see diagram)]
