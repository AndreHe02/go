C[Hi & thanks for the review ;)





I commented the game so as to give you

an impression of my line of thought during the game.



I tried to concentrate on strategic stuff more than single moves.

Hi, my name is Jim.  I haven't played online in quite a while, but I am 2k in Japan and last time I checked I was borderline 7k on KGS.]

(;B[fc]SQ[jc]C[My line of thought was: secure the corner and give a bit of pressure on white.



 I've seen that he still has the possibility to make a base, but still thought this to be a good move.

That line of thinking is good, but it doesn't apply to this situation.  Since you have a 4x4 stone, you are inherently not targeting the corner.  It is still possible to invade at 3x3 so you haven't secured anything.  It's not a BAD move, but there are some bigger moves at the moment.]
;W[mc];B[qj];W[cf];B[cj]SQ[cf]C[As I've already secured the corner, so I wanted to prevent him from spreading along the side and to force him to the middle.

Again, the corner is not "secure."  This is a fighting move, so you are betting that you can out-maneuver your opponent.]
;W[bd];B[cc];W[bc];B[bb]C[NOW you've secured the corner (until the end hehe)]
;W[ef];B[cn];W[fp];B[en];W[iq]
(;B[ej]C[So far I liked it.

This move lacks spirit.  It's so far from white, and very small and defensive.]

;B[rn];W[qq]C[We have repeated the same pattern on both sides. As I believed this to be in my favour, I was quite happy about it.

It looks about the same to me, you get the side and white gets the bottom.]
(;B[eh]SQ[gn][jj]C[I wanted to increse the pressure on the white group. Now I think this might have been a small move. White just need to jump and is nearly connected to its base at the upper side.



If he does it also reduces room towards the center for my upper left group.



I'm now thinking about G6 or maybe even the center.

Yes, he doesn't even need to escape because he can go right under the stone you just played.  This stone doesn't really have a purpose, see the variations for some pressuring moves.]
;W[mn];B[nl];W[gn];B[in]SQ[hn][ho][hp][io][ip][jn][jo][jp][kn]
[ko][kp][ln][lo][lp]C[I did not want him to have all the marked territory. So I figured I should attack.

A good plan, just be careful because there is a nasty move at D7 that white could play later.]
;W[jo];B[il]C[That's how it often goes down, when I attack. I just don't know to make it more....hmmm...devastating ;)





I was still happy at this point. It often happens to me that I defend my corners and the side but do not

gain enough influence in the center (I'm talking about HUGE patches of enemy space). So I really wanted

to create another pattern in this game...and it worked.



In retrospect I see that I've underestemated how huge the area at the bottom is.

Live and learn (about the bottom).  If I were white though, I would happily chase your new weak group around and after you escaped I would attack at D7.  Worst case scenario, I kill the D5 group and send the E12 group on the defensive.]
;W[me]
(;B[kg]SQ[mg]C[What would have been the best move to prevent him from expanding too much?

N13 better?



My thought at this point was : If he expands, I can threaten to penetrate his territory so he will

stop me first.

This stone will just end up getting attacked by white.  It is not going to stop much.  N13 is a normal move (called "boshi" or capping move) . Also, if you played at O14, you could end up making a wall facing your wall at the bottom and you would win the exchange.]
;W[mg]C[Well, he didn't and suddenly I did not like my idea either.]
;B[lh]SQ[jh][kh][ki][li][lj]C[Trying to stop him and defend the marked territory.

You can't defend anything with two stones.  White has many ways to reduce that area to almost nothing, you should focus entirely on survival.]
;W[nh];B[ph];W[nj]
(;B[nk]C[What would have been the best move here? This seems not to be it.

I would play as in the variation I made.];W[mj]C[Now your territory that you wanted to "protect" a few moves earlier is gone.  Don't touch stones unless you have to.  They will just get stronger.  Think like a snake, going around wide and then constricting.]
;B[lj];W[je];B[mh]SQ[ng]C[It was meant as a threat to cut at O13 ....

a valid threat, it would be a sizable loss for white if you managed to kill that group.]
;W[mk]SQ[lj]C[But he totally ignored me. I've then realized that there is actual danger of him connecting AND beleived there to be a danger for M10.



To be honest - I don't quite know why I thought M10 might be in that grave of a situation. Maybe my brain played a trick on me.

Don't panic, if you think like a snake you can stop this group.]
(;B[lk]C[....an that's why I play here. N8 better?

Well this pretty much lets him connect.];W[ml];B[lm]SQ[mm]C[I thought I could prevent him from connecting at this point and realized far too late that I couldn't. So this is damage control.]
;W[mm];B[ng]C[This move is meaningless now.];W[ln];B[km];W[io]
;B[kn];W[ko];B[ni];W[fm];B[el];W[nf];B[og];W[mi];B[oi]C[Only now I see how much territory it cost me that I had allowed him to crawl over the board.



I think this was the worst mistake up to know.  

Well, as I said before, the territory was not very secure, so don't feel too bad.  You secured a large right side.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[cd];B[dc];W[de];B[dg];W[cg];B[be]TR[bc][bd][cd]
[cf][cg][de][ef]C[I suck at life and death, but thought something like:



Hey, maybe its still time to kill these. Better throw in a stone.

Not in the cards.  The rule to learn is this:  ALWAYS surround first.  That way, even if you fail to kill the group, it won't get out.  If you throw stones in like this and he gets out and then on top of that you fail to kill him....well....I think you get the picture.]
;W[gf]C[...and realized that it is very unlikely to go down that way.

xD Doh!  Though it really helped me get better when someone told me what I just told you (about surrounding first).]
;B[fe];W[ff];B[bf]C[I have no idea why I did that ;)];W[bg]
C[well he responded, so no harm done]
(;B[gh]C[This was about the time I was realizing that my chances of wiining this game were rapidly declining.



I had some hope, though.

If there is one thing I learned by playing against old Japanese men every other week, it's to not lose hope.  If you lose hope, your game will simply suck from that point on.  I was often surprised at how close a game was that I thought I was losing badly in.]
