C[Dear reviewer,

I'm not sure at which point the game was lost.  I'd felt the
game had mostly proceeded as I intended.  But late into the endgame,
I realized I was lagging by a few points and couldn't see any
way of making them up.

I've posted some comments and questions and please respond to
them.  Of course, please add  any additional thoughts and advice
you have regarding how I (and my opponent) played.  And, if possible,
please take a close look at the endgame and let me know how I
might've played more effectively.

Thanks for your help!

Cheers,
Ken


Dear Ken,

I thought you had a good game until B53 - a major error as well
as B59.  I felt W had a better game after playing W66.  With
B113, you seemed to steal the lead.  However, when W won the
ko fight with W208, the lead (though still very close at this
point) was stolen again, after which it was too late to catch
up.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[jd];W[po]LB[pl:A]
C[You could consider playing at A to try and make a large-scale
framework at the top.];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql];B[fq]
LB[qj:A]C[This looks good.  A is also a good point for you, but overall
your move is better.];W[ip];B[fo];W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ir]LB[cj:B]
[in:A]TR[ip]C[Maybe it's just my style, but I would play at A to try and seize
the initiative.  The goal would not necessarily be to capture
W's marked stone, but to either make thickness in the center
or destroy W's potential territory on the left (getting both
would win be a winning game).

It is also important note that W has a weak stone and has not
finished the josekis on the top and bottom (he needs to play
at B).

I think B has a better game, even though it is still early.]
;W[cj]
(;B[nn]LB[jo:C][pj:b][in:a]TR[ip]C[is #23 too ambitious?  also thought about j6, but wasn't sure
it'd be effective.  and now, in hindsight, q10 looks rather attractive.

N: I think A or C is superior - it seizes the initiative.  W's
left side has some weaknesses so why not try to attack W's lone
stone and drive it to the left side.  You could also build thickness
in the center (and let W live small) and use it to destroy the
left side potential.

See vars.  Please note that I don't go into too much detail in
these variations (partly because it is very complicated).  What
is more important is the strategy I am recommending.];W[im]
C[A definite must.];B[fm]C[Good move];W[el];B[fl];W[lp]LB[ek:A]
C[W is nowhere near safe even wwith this move - it is in the wrong
direction.  The right direction is out into the center.  W also
needs to play around A or else suffer some major damage.]

C[b 29-33:  i onlt wanted to settle the shape in sente and go elsewhere.

N: First of all, I still think you should keep attacking W's
group rather than let it off the hook.  Secondly, I think A is
better than B37, after which a B descent at B would be quite
troublesome for W.  Third, if B37 is to be viewed as a leaning
attack on the center group, it is not very effective.];W[qk]

[oj][ok][ps][pr][fr][fs][es]C[After B51, B should be getting territory in the center.  However,
your following moves are not consistent with this.

Let's do a rough count:

W:  left - 36
    middle - 3
    right - 13

Total - 52

B:  bottom - 5
    center - 38

Total so far is 43 which means B simply needs 10 more points
to be winning.  In other words, B is winning at this stage of
the game.];W[nc]
(;B[pf]LB[oc:B][nd:A]C[Attaching at A is better.  Attaching at B would be more agressive.
The bottom line is W should get very little here (he is way outnumbered)
and B should get alot - B53 does not allow this.

B should be able to come out ahead in this position.

See vars.];W[pb]
(;B[qc];W[kc];B[ri]LB[kd:A]C[I still think you should protect the center with a move like
A.];W[pl];B[cc]TR[jd][fc]C[b59 seems to be of questionable timing.  maybe better to press
at n16 or thereabout to build up the center?  but i was worried
about the safety of f5-k16 stones.

N:  B59 is a major error in strategy.  The fact you end with
gote is especially painful.];W[dc];B[db];W[cd];B[bb];W[bc];B[cb]
;W[le]TR[kl][kk][ji][pl]C[This shows the biggest problem with b59-65:  I ended with gote
for a rather small gain in the corner.  There would seem to have
been plenty of opportunities to play there later.

N: W66 and the marked stone make your marked stones look wasted.
This is definitely not good for B.

If you do a rough count now, it is W that is ahead.];B[ii];W[gj]

[ii][gi][fi]C[was thinking that maybe i can grab some territory between the
marked stones by sealing the triangled stones in somehow.  didn't
really think this through clearly though.

N: to grab territory between your marked stones, you'd have to
play at A and B for about 16 points of territory, which isn't
that much.  Playing at C makes the game a little closer - see
var.];W[ch];B[cg]C[for a split second, thought some play could be made to cut through,
