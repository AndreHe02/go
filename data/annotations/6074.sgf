(;W[cm]C[A bit timid. A squeeze play would use w stone in bottom right better, and w d5 puts more pressure on b.]
;B[qo]C[Was it safe to tenuki, even if it was here, where I played
a large kakari?

w o4 looks better. Tenuki is risky, because b would play another kakari, bringing e3 into play.]

(;W[mq]C[This seemed weak; an attack on D16 seems much better.

The dilemma is the result of the timid play at c7. In an even game, white must be more aggressive.]
;B[hq]
(;W[fc]C[A kakari at p16 is better, I think. It keeps b low on the right, and works well with the two stones bottom right.]

;W[je];B[ke]C[Should white have cut at L16, or was playing K14 right?

A cut would be too adventurous, and w has already forced b to use too many moves in a small space. K14 is strong.]
;W[jf];B[me]C[And another b move, and it doesn't even prevent the cut at L16.]
;W[kf];B[le];W[qj]C[Given b's strength at the top, this might just be too deep. Q10 might be better. But the invasion is wll timed. Note also that w should be aiming at the b shimari top left: it has been weakened by the w group around g16. That's for later. (C12 for instance.)]
;B[qg]C[This leaves a weakness at R17, which w could exploit if he gets stronger in the area. B's corner does not look entirely safe.]

seems like a weak shape.

W ends in gote, or must sacrifice b17. B looks heavy, but safe.]

form bad aji.
