C[Hello! I am Bernd Sambale, German 4k, KGS 2k, HonFu there and here in the ladder.

This game ... is a total chaos. Several groups were fighting for life, I think at the worst moment it were 11. That can't have been proper strategy, but at the same time it seemed not to be avoidable. The winner could have been either black or white at any moment. I'd like to have this fighting criticized from a dan perspective, to know where the mistakes were, where one side could have succeeded over the other, or how this crazy simultaneous dying could or should have been avoided. Especially I'd like to have some principles on which I can hold to while fighting, and maybe some recommendations about what to read and how to study.

Thank you very much!

Some general ideas to begin with: (in order of importance.)

1. Try to look on the whole board.
 Search the biggest move, not only a lokal move.
 Tenuki is always an option.
2. Study live and death problems to improove your reading skill.
3. Be willing to sacrifice unimportant stones.
4. Play save, when you have the lead.
5. Move the weakes group first, attack the weakes group first.
6. Do not atari if you cannot capture.
7. Choose the firmer capture.

This game is so messy, that I dont think I found all the ideas to improove. I might have found 1/3 of the important variations.
However the main issue seems to be the general feeling of the game to me.
Try not to panic or get to enthusiastic about capturing goups. Look at the whole game and search for a way to win it.]

;W[cm];B[hn]C[H.: So I finally got out of this advantageous, but to my feeling it seemed like a coincidence. Both of us were trying to handle stuff which was probably just too much for our strength.

But the fighting is far from over, now the mutual killing starts ...

Actually the fighting should be over, black should win easy now. However the problem is, that black keeps on playing complicated moves all the time instead of winning the game.]

Q15 is weak, so b can attack here.

Q15 failed to answer o12 so this is logic.]))
