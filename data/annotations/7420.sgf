[cq:F][dq:E][pq:G]C[It seemed the right and left sides were becoming increasingly difficult to invade. Was white's approach correct here? I marked just a few of the possible invasion points, those were the first ones which came to my mind. I think your R15 is fine here too, but wanted to show that both sides still are very open

I think white is doing fine so far and I don't agree that the right and the left are very hard to invade.]

[ns][os][ps][ss]C[I think this was not a bad game. The biggest mistake would be not playing Q3 much earlier. Also there were more 'senseless center moves' than I would like to see, usually it is better to make a base or attack your opponents base than just to jump into the center. 
Another bad habit is not taking stones when you can, just realize that this can give your opponent too many forcing moves later.

If you have any more questions, feel free to email me at NannyOgg42@gmail.com or find me on KGS at my NannyOgg id. 

Have a good time playing go and do go problems every day.])
