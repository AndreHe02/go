C[Hi, my name is Johanna Tuominen and I'm EGF 2 kyu from Finland. 

Overall, you play is quite territory oriented and you stay too much on the third line. You should fine a balance between 3rd and 4th line. It's not easy to change playing style, I know because I have the same problem still occasionally :-)
Anyhow I added comments and variations, hope they help. Enjoy the game of Go!]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de]LB[cg:A]C[JT: You might also consider a pincer here. For instance in A. I added two common Joseki variations for this pincer. 

The C15 is ok too (the one you played).]
(;W[ce];B[cf];W[cd]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[JT: Nowdays at pro-games one often sees that do not play according to the joseki at A or B but tenukis to approach the lower left corner. See the variation.]

(;B[dg]
(;W[fc]C[I believe the upper left corner is joseki.
JT: Yes it is. See some variations from the previous node.]
;B[ck];W[cm]LB[nc:A][nq:B]C[This was more a reaction than a well-thought out move.  I either moving along one of the open sides or against the corners would be better.

JT: You are correct that this is not a good move. Its a bit slow... Approaches either to A or B would be much better.]
;B[dl];W[nq];B[pn]
(;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[fq]C[I would prefer some other answers than the D3. See the variations.]

(;W[eq];B[fp]C[JT: The problem with the E3 move is that it tries to secure the corner but at this point it does not do that. 3-3 invasion at C3 lives.]

(;W[hq]LB[kp:A]TR[kq][nq]C[JT: It is not very effective to play all stone on third line or all stones to the fourth line. One shoul have balance. The marked stones would be much more effective if the L3 stone would be in A. The territory is still quite secure but the influence to the center is much better. 

The 3-3 invasion possibility is shown in variations. Thus, I would have considered other ways to answer black F3 approach. See variations from node 19.]

(;B[do];W[co];B[dn]
(;W[cq]C[...
JT: Playing C6 would secure the corner too, just more points.
See variation from previous node.];B[cn]
(;W[bn]C[Yeah, this move was kind of foolish.];B[kc];W[qj]C[My expectation was that black would respond with r8 and white would r11.]
;B[ql]
(;W[qd]C[At this point, I think I'd changed my mind or something.

JT: This is works well at this situation if black plays R17 but since black played R15 this is not so good because it gives black more influence and you only get the corner life. See the variations from th eprevious node.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[pc];W[re];B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[rf];B[qg];W[qb]
;B[nc];W[ic];B[rg];W[rd];B[ok];W[mn]C[Despite black's low amount of actual cash, I noticed at this point that black seemed to have superior center influence.

JT: Yep, black influence is stunning. I think black stone somewhere M9 would cause white a lot of troubles... But the idea in your move is good because now it is urgent to prevent blacks tries to make center moyo.]
;B[ip]
(;W[bo];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[fr];B[hp]
(;W[jd]C[I really wasn't sure what to do.  I wanted to reduce f8 area or o15 area so that black wouldn't have giant territories in the center., but was worried about being cut and having the reduction fail.  Though having some reducing stones be captured probably doesn't necessarily mean reduction will not be accomplished in some manner.]

;W[mi];B[nh]LB[ll:A]TR[kh]C[JT: Continue to push while you have a chance. You have two ways to connect by eating the marked stone ot connect to the group at the lower side by A.]

(;W[ll]LB[ni:A]C[JT: Black should have played A now and prevent your reduction. Like mentioned in the previous node no hurry to connect because you have two ways to do that.]

;B[kb];W[jc]C[I gave up sente for very little return.];B[lp]
;W[lq];B[mp];W[qr]C[I suspect r2 was an overplay.

JT: Now its a normal move stealing points from the corner. Black answer usually to S2.]

(;B[nn];W[ko];B[mm];W[lm];B[nm];W[lo];B[gd];W[gc];B[ed]C[JT: In thi end you should have answer to this. You lost quite a lot points from the upper left corner in the end. Though I think you should push from G12 stone first because black will defend. At this point you have more secure area than black and also a komi so the game looks good to you.]
