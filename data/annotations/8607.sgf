C[Hi there Mister or Madam reviewer!

I was hoping to get some insight what we're doing wrong and right. :)  Each of us made a few obvious mistakes, and loads of not so obvious ones.  I was hoping to get some insight on the not so obvious ones.  As well as fuseki and chuban.

I've gone and marked all of the obvious mistakes in the comments.  Please correct me if I'm wrong and let me know if I missed anything.

Thank you so much in advance.

================================

Hi Michael

My comments in the game are preceded by my initials, "NR". 

In general, try to avoid responding to each other just because a move was played somewhere. Try to think out the reasons for playing somewhere, and try to have more than 1 reasons to play somewhere. That is, try to achieve 2, or even 3 purposes by placing one stone (e.g. defend and make territory, or attack and make territory, or attack and reduce opponent and make territory etc).

I think black had a comfortable game once the right side was connected. That's a reason to keep the game simple and gain few points here and there rather than complicating the game with risky invasions. As you noticed, the invasion you felt was awkward, ended up as a group that would have died if it wasn't for white's oversight. By not complicating things, you avoid risking mistakes like that that may easily cost you the game. 

Feel free to ask me if you need any clarifications. I hope you will find this review helpful.]
;B[dd];W[pp]C[Ben: onigaishimasu];B[cp]C[Michael Reilly: You have a good game too :)]
;W[ep];B[pd];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[bo];W[iq];B[dn];W[qf];B[qh]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od]C[NR: See variation. White usually goes for S16 here.]
(;W[oc];B[nc]LB[nb:A][nd:B]C[NR: White could perhaps cut here?]
(;W[nb];B[mc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe]LB[dj:A][pj:B]C[NR: The two sides seem to be the most open areas currently on the board. Personally I prefer the right side (i.e. B) since it is also an extension from the bottom right corner (Q4). R10 is therefore not a bad move if you ask me, however it may be considered to be "close to black's thickness"... If that is what worries you, perhaps R9 is also a good option?]
;W[qj]LB[mb:A][di:B][qn:C]C[This seems questionable to me.]
;B[qn]LB[mb:A][di:B]C[This too.  What's the best way to play this stuff out?

NR: Now this move is perhaps not the best, as you are basically invading white's area without much reason to do so at the moment. You still have big moves to play on the left and top. With R6 you can end up with a weak group, for no reason. Having said that, it's a mistake I still do! so you may wish to also review this with a strong player who can further elaborate.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[np];B[ql]LB[pi:A]C[NR: R8 is now too close to R6 stones, making the shape inefficient. Also white has the option to prevent connection of black's stones, by playing for example at A. Then black gets his weak group there. See variation.]

;W[sj];B[nn]C[NR: Result seems too good for black, with all his stones on the right connected..]
;W[ci]
(;B[ck]C[NR: You can also try to play from the top side, as you are already strong at the bottom and C9 is considered close to your strength. If you try C13, you can start developing the top corner as well. See variation.]
;W[cf]C[NR: Black can answer solidly at C16 and avoid complications with invasion etc.]
(;B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[cc];B[dc];W[be];B[bd];W[cd];B[cb]C[Wrong order, obvious mistake.]
;W[bc]
(;B[nr]LB[mb:C][id:A][lp:D][qq:B]C[Questionable.  I was considering also A and B.

NR: C also seems like a big point to me. You are right, O2 seems a bit awkward. I would not play it. Black seems ahead and no need ot invade so deep. How about M4 (i.e. D) or L4?]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[qp];B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[nq];B[or];W[lq];B[no]
;W[mr];B[lp]C[Slow

NR: Compare this, with just playing M4 without the preceding moves (i.e. variation at move 57).]
;W[kp]
(;B[lo];W[id]LB[ff:A][gf:B][if:C]C[NR: I would probably try something from above. Threaten to close in and/or capture the invading stone, while also developing centre influence?]
;B[kd];W[gc];B[fc];W[gb];B[bb];W[ad];B[ib]C[Strange.

NR: Indeed.];W[if];B[kf];W[eb];B[fb];W[fa];B[gd];W[hc]LB[gf:A]
C[NR: Try to play more lightly. No need to force white to attack your stones. You help white connect and at same time make your strange move "J18" even weaker.]
;B[hd];W[ic];B[ie];W[je];B[he];W[jd]LB[jf:A]C[NR: Can probably just cut here and fight.]

(;B[im]C[NR: In general, don't peep if you can cut! Go for the cut here. See variation. It is in my opinion good for black.]
;W[in]C[NR: Now white is happily connected and heading to reduce any potential territory in the centre.]

NR: Right! Slow, unnecessary, and simply BAD SHAPE. It is basically the Empty Triangle (twice). Avoid forming this unless in the rar cases where it is considered the "only move" - I think in some life and death situations.]
