C[[gromit\]: Hi, I'll try to comment that game as much as I can, especially the way you treated the big W group.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jd];W[qi];B[dj];W[jq];B[jj];W[qf]
;B[nd];W[qc]TR[qi][pj]C[[gromit\] Just a remark here, if W wanted to invade then playing Q10 instead of R11 seems better.]
;B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[ob]TR[qf][qi]C[[gromit\] Now W's two marked stones are a bit close to B strength.]

(;B[oc]LB[mb:B][nc:A]TR[nb][cn]C[sounka: This is overplayed isn'it? White could play O18.
Black should have played A or B?

[gromit\] If B really wants to close the side, then O18 is the move (see var), however I think that B could make better use of all his star point stones by trying rather to enlarge his moyo (for instance at C6), or by attacking (right side?).]
;W[pb];B[nb];W[cm]C[[gromit\] W is right. This is bigger that O18.]
;B[qn];W[pn]C[[gromit\] W wrong direction: pushing B towards W weak stones :(]

;B[pi];W[ri];B[rf];W[rg];B[pk]C[[gromit\] up to now, good for B, building strength while attacking. W not alive yet.]
;W[ng]
(;B[ni]C[[gromit\] B seems strong enough on the right to start building his center (see var).]
;W[rk];B[rl];W[rj];B[pg]C[[gromit\] Only reinforces W.];W[pf]
;B[le]TR[mf]C[sounka: Is there any hope to kill white? Am I taking advantage of its weakness correctly?

[gromit\] Yes there is still hope (only 1 eye on the right side).
B can be even a bit more aggressive I guess.];W[lg];B[li];W[jg]
;B[hd]LB[nq:A]TR[hg]C[Sounka: Is A better?

[gromit\] A is big, but W still has to care about his group. However B could be more aggressive (booshi at H13 for instance).]
;W[np];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf]C[[gromit\] useless! Only reinforces W.]
;W[og];B[kh];W[kg];B[hi]TR[hg]C[[gromit\] The direction seems to let W get some space. The marked spot (H13) at the same time reduces W space, and builds the top left moyo.]
;W[jh];B[ji];W[gg];B[hh];W[hg];B[if];W[ig];B[dg];W[eg];B[dh]
;W[fd];B[ge]TR[ee]C[[gromit\] the other side is bigger (helps the corner).]

;W[eb];B[ga];W[fb];B[db]TR[hc]C[[gromit\] not necessary: if D18, C18, W still has no eye...
H17 more important.];W[hc];B[ic];W[gc];B[ib];W[ec]TR[fq]C[souka: And now? How can black take advantage of it influence in the center? I tried press on white stones on the bottom line to make territory.

[gromit\] Influence is for attacking! :)
The simplest way is probably an invasion around F3.];B[jo];W[hp]
C[[gromit\] this exchange seems good for W.];B[lo];W[lq];B[mm]
;W[nm];B[ml];W[mn];B[ln]TR[eq]C[[gromit\] B's center not very big.
W E3 seems enough to win (slightly).];W[dq];B[dn];W[cn];B[hn]
;W[el];B[fn];W[fq]C[[gromit\] does not seem necessary... and at least F3 was better.]

[rn][sn][ko]C[[gromit\] The end is pretty straightforward. Once W got ahead, he played rather conservatively, but stays ahead.

The game was not bad for B, especially as long as he kept attacking W, but he lost some time early in the game when he closed up the upper right gote (losing the initiative).

Letting W live was probably a mistake (D18?) but since B lacked some aggressivity before it might have been unavoidable.

However, after W life, since B did not gain as much as he could have, on the top, the game is close.

I think B could have won by invading and thus erasing W bottom: B center is slightly above 20 points, but W bottom is over 60. By cutting it in half (invasion around F3), B erases more than what he gains in the center.

There were thus no very bad mistakes but a few direction mistakes from B:
when playing so many star points, B should think "moyo" before "territory" (upper right), think building while attacking (H13 not played), and think invade (backed up by influence).

B could also improve his Life&Death ability, since killing W could have ended the game much before ;)

Good luck in your Go, and don't hesitate to ask me if some questions were left unanswered.]

(;B[mf];W[ni];B[ml]TR[mf]C[[gromit\] N14 starts building up the top side, and there is enough strength on the right to still be able to blacade W.]
))
(;B[nb];W[oc];B[nc];W[od];B[oe]TR[oa][ne]C[[gromit\] B shuts W off. However there are weaknesses left on both parts:
W can cut at O15... but B can kill at P19!

What usually happens is that W cuts B answers (for one or two moves), then W has to come back to live, but has created some aji (potential).]
