C[Dear reviewer,
thanks a lot for having a look at this game. HamatoYosh played mafutrct. Please review for both players.]
;B[qd];W[od];B[ec];W[pp];B[dp];W[de];B[cd]C[is this the correct area to play? how about pincering the P16 stone instead?

Trillian:
Yes, it is a very good move. I don't want to tenuki in this corner because c17 would be very big for white.]

(;W[ce];B[dd];W[ee];B[fd];W[dj]
(;B[mc]C[is this the correct move?

Trillian:
Yes! I think with the F16-stone a pincer is excellent.]
(;W[ne]C[Is this a good move?];B[me]C[is this a good answer?

Trillian:]
(;W[ng]C[white just didnt want to strengthen n15 in any way. is this a good idea?

Trillian:
I think letting black play N14 hurts worse than strenghtening him with N14.]
;B[mf]C[is this the correct answer?

Trillian:
of course! Later F15 will make a promising moyo.];W[qf]C[Trillian:
I think you should simply leave this corner as it is and take sente (C8!). Later you can come back and make life in the corner or sacrifice with P18.]

(;B[oc]C[Trillian:
Unluckily for you this doesn't work without N16.];W[nc];B[nb]

(;W[nd]LB[ob:B][pb:C][pc:A]C[i thought about B or C, but for some stupid reason i discarded them and play A instead - terrible mistake.]

(;B[pc]C[Trillian:
wrong direktion. The left side is much more important than the corner. You can connect with M18 for example.
(see var.)];W[md]
(;B[lc]C[this is painful

Trillian:
yes!];W[ld];B[cl]C[f16 looks retarded now

Trillian:
but this is an important move anyway.]
(;W[ck]C[white later says this move is bad

Trillian:
More natural is the variation.];B[dl];W[jp]
(;B[qn]LB[qk:A]C[Is this move ok for black? how about black A instead?

Trillian:
I think it is better than A. (see var.)];W[ql]
(;B[nq]
(;W[oo]C[Trillian:
good move!];B[qq];W[qp];B[pq];W[mp]C[white likes this outcome better than white Q6, because N4 is promising for w. and b cannot play O4 because K4 is in a good position. right?

Trillian:
This move (alternative N5) is joseki. Q6 is almost never played.]

(;B[op];W[po];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[np];B[oq];W[fj]C[white is relieved - now c11 does not work anymore :<]

(;B[qh]C[i counted black behind even if black plays S6.
so i invaded deep and hoped for a fight that makes black alive while still leaving the option to play S6 later.

Trillian:
Behind or not, this invasion is too deep. Better play some reducing move (like O11 - which may also be deep) and eventually follow-up with R12.]
;W[qg];B[ph]C[i tried to use the black move at O14];W[ni]C[Trillian:
you're in a big trouble now.];B[oh];W[nh];B[of];W[pe];B[nf]
;W[og];B[pf];W[pg];B[qe]C[i successfully created a fight, but white has the advantage :(

Trillian:
You gave a very big sure-territory with 3 stones inside for a unpromising fight for your own group. This is not very successfull because white will have no problem connecting his group to the left.]

mafutrct:
i thought that black dies first. i'll show my reading in the following moves.

This is definitely too early to resign.]

Reading out only one variation cannot be enough to resign. Also this variation gould be wrong ^^.]

is this result better or worse than the game?

Trillian:
better for black. Thats why white plays kosumi like in the game and not this variation. Whites idea is to seal black to the corner to build a big white moyo above.]

It is much worse then simply sacrificing the corner because I'm not sure if the corner is already alive and your upper side is "open at the bottom" which makes it much smaller than it looks like.]

(;W[lf]C[Trillian:
In this situation whit will definitely extend here to reduce blacks potential on the upper side.]
;B[oc]C[Trillian:
After this white plays usually tenuki. He can use sente for C6.
The reason why white omits Q16&R15 is that if he leaves is like it is, later he has the choice to play Q17 and make live in the corner by ko.]

Also a good idea. C6 is very strong for white so it is good to take away this point from him.]

Trillian:
No, after the joseki the F16-stone becomes wothless. Pincer is better.]

(;W[fq]LB[ce:A]C[Should white play here first to see black's response?

Trillian: 
No, I think the played move is better because maybe black doesn't answer now but grab the whole upper-left-corner by playing A. The White stone looks very weak then.]
