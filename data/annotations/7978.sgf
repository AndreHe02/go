Is my rank around 12kyu?
What does I need to work on?

Hylomorph: Hi.  I haven't played on KGS for awhile, but I am about 5 or 6 kyu there.  I will answer these questions as best I can :)

As for how strong you actually are, I would base my estimation on (A): How strong your opponent is, and (B): How badly you won or lost to him.  

For example, if your opponent is a 14 kyu and you barely beat him (around a 5 point victory), then you are probably about a 12-13 kyu.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[oc];W[po];B[np]C[Hylomorph: I would personally have preferred a pincer here, since it plays off the strength of your upper left corner enclosure.  Maybe around R10.  But what you played is fine I think.

You may know this already, but always build frameworks in "boxes".  An example would be stones at R10 and P10 alongside your R16/P17 enclosure.  This kind of framework is very strong.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[Hylomorph: I'm not familiar with this joseki, but this seems correct :)]
;W[qk];B[on]C[Once again, I'm not familiar with this joseki, but a play elsewhere looks good.  Maybe an approach around F3 or a play at R11 (looking to invade the right side while building your "box" framework) seems better to me.]
;W[pm]C[This is not a good move from him.   P5 or Q6 are better.]
;B[pn];W[qn];B[jq]C[I'm not familiar with the joseki, but I would still prefer a play at F3.  If he goes into the K3 area, you should get a nice attack.  Plus your lower right group is almost settled.

But if it's joseki, don't worry about it :)];W[qh]C[Slow move.  D10 is larger and looks like a menacing framework.]
;B[jc]C[Again, you want to build "Box" frameworks, not "Flat" ones like this.  Admittedly, he took R12... but at this point an approach to either of his corner stones on the left would be better.]
;W[dj]C[Finally she plays it.  

At this point, it seems like she has a better opening.  Her group on the right side is stable, she has a nice framework on the left, and she has somewhat spoiled your potential framework on the upper right side.  

Remember to play first in the corners, then the sides, and then finally in the center.  She has an advantage so far (in my opinion) because you played in the sides before the center.  These types of general opening principles are often more valuable then learning specific joseki and fuseki patterns.]
;B[cn]
(;W[dn]C[Bad move on her part I think.

Contact plays (like D6) oftentimes strengthen the enemy stones that they touch.  Your C6 stone is already under pressure from D4 and D10, so making it stronger is the last thing she wants.  If she wanted to play a contact move, C5 is much superior.  Check the variation for my continuation.]
(;B[co]C[Interesting, but not the joseki I know.]
(;W[do];B[bq]C[C7 or C4 look better];W[gc];B[bk]C[Low, and unnecessary.  C7 is better, but I would have played K15 or an approach at C14.]
;W[cf]C[C15 is best for her.  What she played (C14) leaves open the 3-3 Invasion still.]
(;B[gg]C[I don't know what this move does. 

If you'd like to know good plans during this stage (after all the corners and sides have been taken), you should start working your groups out into the center, or reducing and invading your opponent's territory.

This move doesn't really serve a purpose, as far as I can see.

Possible ideas are the 3-3 invasion at C17 (a well-known joseki).  Here is the Sensei's Library page for it: http://senseis.xmp.net/?AllAbout33PointInvasion

If you have never used the Sensei's Library before, it is a very nice tool for learning to play Go :)

Another move I like is K15.  This strengthens your top sphere of influence and even threatens her group on the top left.

Another move I like is D8.  This move both strengthens your connection between your C5 and B9 stones, and cuts his in two.  If you don't know what to do, and you see a move that cuts, play that :)

Other ideas (though not as good, in my opinion) are reducing her territory by playing shoulder hits like Q11.  See the variation for an example.]
;W[ec]C[Now the 3-3 invasion will not work, but she should have played this a move earlier.]
;B[hd]C[K15 is still better, if you want to develop your top group.]
;W[gn]C[A bad move.  Shouldn't play close to your own wall.]
;B[gq]C[Low, but I'll let this slide for now :)  I still like D8.]
;W[ng]C[Kind of wild.  O12 is better.]
(;B[nk];W[me]C[??];B[mc];W[in];B[ko]C[I like K5 better.];W[rf]
;B[hc]C[This doesn't do much besides touch her stone.];W[gb]
;B[hb];W[cl]C[This is a good move that pushes you lower while keeping her connected.]
;B[bl]
(;W[fk]C[??

At this point let's estimate territory.

You have roughly 25 points at the top group.  About 5-8 points in your lower left group.  About 25 points in your bottom group so far, but it could expand.

So you have maybe around 55-60 points.  

She has about 25 points in the right side group.  She has about 25 in her top left group, and then maybe 10 points in her lower left group.  

So she has about 55-60.  

I would say she is maybe leading by a bit, but nothing insurmountable.  

It is good to estimate the points when you're about to make a plan, so that you know how desperate or relaxed your play needs to be to win.  Practice counting points whenever you can.  It doesn't have to be accurate, just a nice estimate.]
(;B[ke]C[S15, C11, P7, and even S2 look good.];W[lg];B[jg];W[dh]
C[B11, trapping your left corner group in, looks better for her.]
;B[km]C[Good.  Still, I like forcing moves like S2 better.]
