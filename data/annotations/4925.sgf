C[s> hello, I am siegoman, requesting this review as an 11k on KGS.  Here are the moves that I am most hoping to get help on:

12: tenuki to get the lower board, reasonable?
22: direction of extending ok?
50: got a wall, how to use it?
60, 62: give up edge threats to seal it in
68: many moves to get the moyo
74: how to seal off the top, and keep sente.
112: how to attack upper group
128: is the attack too dangerous?

s> in this game I gave up four corners hoping to get edges and large center.  I ended up losing by 2.5

please help me see the balance between getting territory and influence.  thank you!  tom]
;B[qq];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[jc];W[gc];B[mc]C[this opening looks sure to end up with white having two solid
corners while black has a cramped group on the top.];W[oc];B[rd]
C[I would say this is an unreasonable continuation for black. 
Black may be able to capture the corner, but white ends up
with huge influence.];W[qe];B[re]
(;W[jp]C[tenuki here is too easy on black.   His unreasonable invasion becomes reasonable.]
;B[qf];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[fp];B[cn];W[mq]C[also very easy on black.]
;B[cc];W[cd]C[enclosing this way looks correct to me.  black
will get a small corner, but white gets buig influence
and the opportunity to press the top group later.];B[dc];W[ec]
;B[eb];W[fb];B[ed];W[fc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[da];W[di]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[np];W[cl];B[qo]C[this looks odd to me, but I can't say definitely
that it isn't good.   I would think of Q5 or Q6];W[pf];B[qd]
;W[qg]C[white should just connect];B[pe];W[oe];B[qe];W[of];B[pc]
;W[od];B[pb]C[from this point on, p18 is a huge point for both sides.]
;W[pj]C[s> P14 looks strong, how can I use it?
maybe it is better to build up N4 more, rather than taking the side

Q10 is not bad, but the big sente is P18
After P18, anything that presses K17-N17
becomes critical for black.  White can really
get momentum.];B[nn]C[this looks slow and not particularly aimed
at anything.  Q8 would put some pressure
on white while also creating a base; but
black's big problem is the two stones
on the top.

P18 might be gote for black, but it
is very big.  Without it black will be
scrambling for the rest of the game.];W[qm];B[mo];W[lo];B[ln]
;W[ko];B[ml]C[again, this is just sloooowly meandering
toward the center.  Not terrible, but easy on
the white guys.];W[nb]C[p18 would still  be better.  This
does start to putting the pressure on.];B[mb];W[he]C[s> here I wanted to build up the left moyo, so I wanted to avoid K17 entering the G12 area.  could you please share some options when sealing in a living group?

This looks like a pretty good move to me. 
Black will have to scramble to keep his
group alive, and white gets good shape.];B[ob];W[je]C[connect at o17 first.  Failure to connect is a
huge mistake.  Sure, the black stones surviv e
in either case, but the difference is black having
a substantial territory on top verses having nothing.];B[rg]
;W[qh];B[rh];W[ri];B[ol];W[em]C[s> many moves are done by white to get the moyo going.  please suggest some alternatives.  I think I had more potential than I came away with.

this also looks Not too bad to me.  White
has several directions to enlarge
the moyo, and black can't block or
invade them all.

The missed opportunity is to build
the moyo by pressing on the black
stones on the top.];B[en]
(;W[do]C[this is pointless, at best.  O17 still needs to
be connected, but the big money is around
K10.  How close white can get to K10
is going to determine the game.];B[dn]C[now black is stronger, thanks to white's help.]
;W[fn];B[co];W[le]C[this is the wrong place to close.  These black
stones are relatively weak and hard to use to
extend into the center.  The black stones from the
lower right corner are the threat.

This is black's last clear chance to prevent a giant
white moyo.  Bold action is required.  I would look
first at white's weakness at f7.  Cut there and see
how white responds, and aim to create a general
melee that eventually connects and spoils a lot
of potential territory.];B[jm]C[this is not bold.];W[hj]C[this looks very passive]
;B[jk]C[matching passive for passive.  Black can be a lot braver.
With all the influence in the corner,  he could jump up
to m11 or l11 and still be sure of connecting.];W[ji];B[hl]
;W[fk]C[I think white should be more agressive in this whole
sequence. Perhaps g8, but still not a bad outcome here,
but white's territory is shrinking and black's expanding
without a fight.];B[mj];W[lh];B[mh]

;B[fm];W[gm];B[fo];W[fl];B[eo];W[go];B[ql]C[a very big move at this point in the game]
;W[nc]C[finally!   o19 is now mandatory, and black's top group
is suddenly very weak.];B[na]
(;W[ib]C[s> I wanted to get some territory while threatening the upper group, what are some other options please.  perhaps it is too late to work up here, if so please suggest some parts of the game to attack up here.

This is relatively small.  The big areas
still available are to reduce black's big
corner as much as possible, and optimize
the boundary between the lower left corner
and white.  Black can still do a some
damage there.];B[ic];W[lc];B[lb];W[md];B[qk];W[qj];B[nj];W[ng]

slightly more confrontational moves would have won the
game.   Don't go overboard and attack wildly, but don't
give black a pass on everything.

moves that white should have punished.])
