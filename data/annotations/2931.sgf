[dg:B]C[SD : it's a good idea to make a pincer, since it helps developping q16 stone but the pincer you choose enable white to play very complex variations (white can play A, B or C, D is not a good answer with the 2 space pincer). 
If you're not ready to deal with white C, i recommend you to play D14 instead of h16.]
;W[cc]C[SD : C17 move doesn't work well with h16. See next comment for explanations.]
;B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[ef];B[dg]TR[bc][cc][dc][cd][be]C[SD : if white wanted to run into the center with E14, it would have been better not to play the delta exchanges : this moves allow black to play D13. Without the delta moves, black can only play C14. This makes a big difference.]
;W[eg];B[dh];W[eh];B[di]C[SD : very good result for black  : white helps black to get territory on the 4th line.]
;W[jd]
(;B[ld]C[SD : it's a good idea to discard the pincer stone now white has a wall nearby.
maybe i would prefer a move at n17, a little bit safer. See variation.]
;W[ie];B[kc];W[jc]
(;B[qc]C[SD : you play in a too small area. This is fuseki : you should play faster, not worriyng about points. See variation starting with M16 at N17.

Technically, playing a kosumi (L17) in front of a 2 stones wall is not good shape, you need to add a stone. See variation starting with r17 at m14.]
;W[le];B[md];W[kb];B[lb];W[kd];B[lc];W[pj];B[jp];W[fq]
(;B[qn]C[SD : this is too much. You don't need to start a second problem, you have allready one to deal with : what to do with k3 stones. see variation.]
;W[qo];B[eq];W[np];B[fp]C[SD : white made a mistake : he should respond to e3 at f4. Now black stone at k4 is almost connected to black F4.
This is a turning point of the game, black has a good game now.]
;W[pn];B[qg]LB[fj:A]C[SD : i think A is really bigger than R13.]
;W[fj];B[ek];W[fk];B[el];W[cq];B[cp];W[er];B[gq];W[fr]
(;B[dq]C[SD : this forcing move doens't help you, and helps white. better not to play there.]
;W[dr];B[gr]C[SD : dangerous, better at G4.];W[bq];B[bp];W[ap]
;B[ao];W[aq];B[bo]C[Sd : now what happens if white cut at G4 ? See variation.]

(;W[kh];B[hl]LB[rj:A][hl:C][qq:B]C[SD : during the rest of the game, both players played played frontier moves. At this moment, Black is in advance.
Bigger moves for black were A, B, C.
i think B gives black a life by ko : it's enough to win the game.

[dp][nq]C[SD : you should seize the initiattve to build a moyo before your opponent in the south.
The north-east area is not an area where both players can make a lot of territory, because each player have allready stones (A,B and C, D).]
