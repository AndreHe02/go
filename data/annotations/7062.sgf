The biggest thing in this game was allowing white to push into your territory, which he could do because oftentimes your stones had gaps he could push through, which also led him to capture many of your stones in the upper-left. When you sketch out your territory, try to leave as few gaps as possible for him to push through. Basic moves such as the 1-space jump and the knight's move are good for this purpose.]
