C[Hello. Haven't played much of games without handicaps
so felt bit of loss here and there. Especially in terms of
opportunities to reduce white's territory. No komi for white
as handicap.

Michael: Hi there, at your level (even at mine) no komi is a very small handicap.  It doesn't begin to become a big deal until dan levels.]

Michael: It was wrong direction.  You should keep white in the corner.]
;W[ee];B[de];W[rh];B[hd]C[I agree.  This move is too good to pass up, even if you have to ignore a shoulder hit.]

(;B[ig]C[Any reason to go here or would simply H13 been better?
Or does the cutting point it would create to my shape be
too bad?];W[hf];B[if];W[df];B[cf];W[dg];B[cg];W[dm]
(;B[ck]C[Would C8 been viable here? I was affraid it would
overextend me from the support of upper stones plus
possibly leave D12 bit of weak against possible cut.

Michae: The thing you need to worry about C8 isn't the cut you leave behind, it's strengthening the D7 stone.]
;W[fm];B[pm]LB[po:A][qo:B]C[Another possibilities I considered were H9, H10 and J9.

Michael: Very optimistic.  You're probably not going to kill that white group.  The purpose of attacking isn't to kill.  You harass, chase, corner, threaten and snarl, but don't try to kill unless you are certain you can kill it.  Otherwise you might push a living group right through your territory and have nothing to show for it.

This approach is too distant, A or B is better.];W[qo]
(;B[qm]C[Think I wasted time here. Extending to O7 feels better.

Michael: This is a very small move, you're correct that O7 would be better, but B31 is just in the wrong place.]

out. Or was this mere stroke of luck/bad play by
opponent/nothing special?

Michael: Black shouldn't be able to live back here, but it's pretty open so black might be able to get some profit from the outside.  If you lived then white probably made a mistake.]

better right? Would have let me cut to points there and
push
from white here is not THAT dangeous....

Michael: E9 is better than D9, but even better is J5.  Playing in the E9 area isn't very big, because that's pretty much dame points. Both you and white have 2 sides of that area.]
