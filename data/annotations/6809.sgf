C[Hi, thank you for reviewing the game in advance.

;B[qn];W[fq]C[Chris: This extension is not played anymore because of the variation.]
;B[cn];W[dr]
(;B[gq]C[Chris: This move looks like a mistake. If white manages to attack this stone, the thickness in the bottom right starts working.]

(;W[cq]C[Chris: The safetymove is premature. White has to avoid being shut in and make the thickness to the right work.]
;B[fp]C[Chris: Now blacks attachment is not a liability anymore. White gets pressed low and the thickness loses power.]
;W[eq];B[go];W[gr]LB[cg:A]C[Chris: Since white is alive in the corner, tenuki would be correct. Pushing on the 2nd line is an emergency measure that should be only played in real emergencies ;)

I would play A to limit the influence black has built.];B[hq]
;W[hr];B[iq]C[I thought this corner turned out well for black. White didn't get much territory, and black got nice influence.]

;W[np];B[os];W[mp];B[dj]LB[fp:A]C[Chris: Good move by black. Since the A group is super strong and rich in eyeshape, Black could extend even further to invite an invasion, depending on the players style.]
;W[bj]LB[qh:A][qi:B]C[Chris: This move seems to be a bit premature, as it helps black build more influence. As White I would have gone for A or B.]
;B[pm];W[qh]
(;B[qj]C[Is this the best move in this situation?

Chris: If you are confident that the top right black group will live (locally, not by running away!) this is the best move.]

(;W[og]LB[ph:A][rh:B]C[Chris: This move leaves aji to connect with the A-B combo. Since black lives locally if white kosumi, white would make better shape by just jumping.]

(;B[of];W[ng];B[nf];W[mf];B[rh]LB[mg:A]C[Chris: If Black doesnt want to cut at A, the pushes were ajikeshi.]

;W[rd];B[re];W[sc];B[oi];W[qk]C[Chris: White got an OK result. It depends now on how well whites lump of stones can be attacked.]
;B[mh];W[mg]
(;B[kf];W[kg];B[nm]C[Chris: Too early. I guess Black regarded this as a forcing move to attack Whites centre more strongly. But since this white group is also not 100% alive, it can be considered aji keshi. When leaning-attacking make sure you lean on a strong group, not a weak one.]
