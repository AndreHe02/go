;B[jc]SQ[jp][op]C[Black has played all but 1 stone on the third line.  During the opening, it is generally a good idea to play about half of your stones on the 3rd line and about half on the 4th line.  In this case, both of black's bottom side stones could have been played on the 4th line, at the squares.  This would still guard the lower right corner and start to enclose more territory than the current stones do.  They would also provide more influence into the center.  Since this particular game turns into a fight over the center, more center infuence from the start would have been very good for black.]

;W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[ol]TR[ff]SQ[ln]C[When you take Sente, it is good to stop and assess the whole board.  Currently, the score is close with black probably a bit ahead. This means that black doesn't need to aggressivly attack, just calmly build territory.  The sides and corners are all rather secure so it is time to work on the center, both trying to get some center territory and trying to prevent white from getting center territory.  M6 helps black secure some center territory and F14 reduces white.  Black should try to play in these areas in the next few moves, before white does.]
;W[dg];B[nj]TR[of]SQ[ln][gf]C[This puts some pressure on white's right side group but that group should have enough space to make life so attacking it doesn't accomplish much.  G14 and M6 are both better here.
If you really do want to put pressure on this white group then P14 is better because it also helps black secure more territory in the top right.]
;W[lo]SQ[jq][nj]C[This is a rather aggressive reduction move by white.  Really it is more of an invasion.  Imagine a line from the K3 stone to the O10 stone.  Any white stone to the right of that line is an invasion and any white stone to the left of that line is a reducing move.
Black could just calmly defend at this point but I would recommend trying to kill this invasion.
See variation starting next move.]
(;B[lq]C[See Variation for an attack on white's stone.];W[mp]
;B[mq];W[np];B[nq]SQ[eo][jn][jo][jf]C[Black should take Sente here.  If white pushes down at O3 then black can simply block at O2.
Good options at this point include attacking white's invastion with K5 or K6, reducing white at E5 or both expanding black and reducing white at K14.]
;W[op];B[pp];W[lm];B[oo]SQ[kn][jl]C[It is probably too late to kill white's invasion but black could harrass it by playing up the K line while white retreats up though the middle.  This would leave black with a line of stones facing white on the left side and make it very hard for white to make center territory.  L6 and then, after white connects, K8 would be a good start.]
;W[jn];B[io]SQ[kj][if][go]C[Now that white's stones in the lower right are pretty much secure, black needs to start reducing white in the center.  J14 and L10 are both good ways to start.
If black really wants to play on the lower left then G5 is better because it both reduces white to some extent and puts pressure on white's lower right stones.]
;W[in];B[ho];W[jo];B[jp];W[hn];B[go];W[fg];B[ng]TR[gk]SQ[kf]
[pf]MA[fn][jj]C[This doesn't really put much pressure on white's right side stones, which are alive anyway, and it doesn't really secure much territory because white can reduce at both Q14 and around L14.
What black needs to worrry about now is preventing white from surrounding a large amount of territory around G9.  K10 would be the best way to start reducing white.  Black will eventually want to reduce at F6 as well.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[og];B[of];W[pf];B[oe];W[hc];B[ib]TR[jj]SQ[jg]
C[This is too small for this stage of the game.  Save this for the endgame.
Now that black has made a wall facing the center, it is time to use it.  K13 starts to make center territory for black and K10 starts to reduce white.]
;W[hb];B[ie];W[ge];B[hg];W[jh]
(;B[jf]SQ[hi]C[Playing on H11 attacks white's stone and would force it to retreat down towards the white stones at K6.  Black could follow down the H line and reduce white in Sente.

;W[rf];B[rd];W[em]SQ[fn]C[Black's reducing move at F6 will no longer do much.]
;B[hi];W[hk];B[gj];W[gn];B[fo]SQ[ei][fk]C[Both F9 and E11 reduce white more]
;W[fn];B[eo];W[dn];B[do];W[co];B[eq]SQ[fk][ei]C[F9 or E11 would be better.  Reducing white is very important now.]

;B[bs]TR[kh]SQ[gf][gh][oi][mn]C[Black should play some Sente reducing moves before responding to this.  White will probably respond to a black stone at each of the squares.  Then black can secure some more territory at L12.]

(;B[jn]C[Black starts trying to trap white's stone and cut off its retreat. There isn't room for white to make life on the bottom right so retreat is white's only option.  If black can contain the invasion then white will die.]
