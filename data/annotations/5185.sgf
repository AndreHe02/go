There's not a lot I can say about this game, because I think my strategy is sound, and I think I proved that by winning the game.  However, there has been a lot of dispute about how this opening should have played out, and whether or not it was good.

Please review this game for both players, with special attention to the opening.  I also have a question about one of the variations at move 16, regarding a later board position.

Also, please note that because both players' KGS accounts have been relatively unused for a long time, I've submitted the game under our AGA ranks.  We reviewed the game ourselves afterwards; I've left our comments in so our thought process is more evident.

-- Raine];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp]C[Raine [?\]: Blah.
Raine [?\]: I need to stop playing hoshi.];W[dc]LB[ce:C][de:B]
[cf:A]TR[bb]C[lcninja [11k\]: sorry about the lag there
lcninja [11k\]: was getting a drink
Raine [?\]: No problem.
lcninja [11k\]: A or B
lcninja [11k\]: You  have two 4x4s
Raine [?\]: Hm, I think A.
lcninja [11k\]: Either is fine
lcninja [11k\]: but..
Raine [?\]: That's a game I could play.  I don't like the location of B.
lcninja [11k\]: C is inconsistent

ndkrempel: The "professional" choice seems to be mostly B in this fuseki.

However, I wouldn't let that discourage you from trying moves like C,
as although to professional eyes they may be bad, that often pales
in comparison to the other sorts of mistakes amateurs will make.
(Of course several 9p's have also tried C over the years,
presumably with a special strategy in mind.)

On the other hand, you should of course be aware of the
relationship of your stones to each other at all times,
(and so the high move at B makes more "sense" in this position,
but isn't categorically better.)];B[ce]C[lcninja [11k\]: This is bad
Raine [?\]: You can't call that bad.
lcninja [11k\]: I just did
Raine [?\]: But what would you have played?];W[dh]C[ndkrempel: Seems a good choice of pincer.]

(;B[ee]C[Raine [?\]: To be honest, I was considering C11.
Raine [?\]: But discarded it.
lcninja [11k\]: C11 is an idea
lcninja [11k\]: but not a very good one :)

ndkrempel: An alternative plan at this point would be to jump out further and try
to attack D12 on a large scale (see variation.)

You can also try to live quickly and take sente (see other variation.)

I'm not so happy with E15 as, after white F16, there doesn't seem to be
any good point for black.];W[fd]C[lcninja [11k\]: guess
Raine [?\]: B17, but that seems very submissive.
Raine [?\]: B12 is too early.
Raine [?\]: Tenuki, possibly?
Raine [?\]: K16]
(;B[fe]C[lcninja [11k\]: this is bad
Raine [?\]: Options?
lcninja [11k\]: you can't push white on the 4th line

ndkrempel: I agree that this move is very bad here.

It is sometimes fine in a handicap game or when black has a strong attack below,
to compensate for the territory he has given white.

In this case, there is no severe attack, so it loses points.]
;W[gd]C[lcninja [11k\]: yay!  4th line!];B[bh]C[lcninja [11k\]: because here

ndkrempel: This move is too low in the opening.

It also makes F15 look more of an unconditional loss,
as the following move does not attack D12 but turns it into a light stone.]
;W[cd]TR[dh]C[lcninja [11k\]: you decide that this is a weak stone
lcninja [11k\]: when it is clearly light..];B[cj]LB[be:A][de:C]
[df:B]C[Raine [?\]: Yay!  Weak group!
Raine [?\]: Yes, but I get either a weak stone or the left side.
Raine [?\]: I give up nine points in the corner.
lcninja [11k\]: and sente..
lcninja [11k\]: This result is clearly worse
lcninja [11k\]: Nevermind the horidness of the shape
Raine [?\]: Yay!  Weak group!
Raine [?\]: Yes, but I get either a weak stone or the left side.
Raine [?\]: I give up nine points in the corner.
lcninja [11k\]: and sente..
lcninja [11k\]: This result is clearly worse];W[nc]C[lcninja [11k\]: you mean e15?
Raine [?\]: You need your glasses checked.
lcninja [11k\]: I don't wear glasses.. I got laser sugery 2001
lcninja [11k\]: Which is like the best come back, of all time.]

(;B[oe]TR[pj][qj]C[Raine [?\]: All time, huh?
lcninja [11k\]: Well second only to "nuh-uhh"
Raine [?\]: Ah.
Raine [?\]: How erudite.
lcninja [11k\]: This is bad
lcninja [11k\]: You should have support when playing this move

-----

I have a question about one of the variations from this point.  Please look over the variations available from here.

ndkrempel: P15 is a little odd in this position - normally it is to develop
a black moyo below, but you haven't got one yet.]
(;W[ld]C[ndkrempel: Right now, white turning at G15 looks like a key point.
So black should play H14 without hesitation.
White will most likely defend the territory at the top,
but then black has sente and white's potential has been limited.
(The stone at D12 gives black bad aji, and he would
like to swallow it up.)];B[oc];W[qi];B[qk];W[qf];B[qe];W[pf]
;B[qn]C[Raine [?\]: So this game has turned bizarre pretty fast.
lcninja [11k\]: Well lets just say.. I didn't take us to this place]

(;W[cn]
(;B[jq]C[ndkrempel: It might be useful for black to make some kikashi
in the top left first (see variation.)];W[be];B[cf]
(;W[gf]C[ndkrempel: This move seems a little thin. Better a knight's move?]
;B[jd]C[ndkrempel: This seems ok as white hasn't answered P17 and there is cutting aji at G15 to aim at.]

(;W[lb]C[ndkrempel: O16 seems to be a more important point.]
;B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[mg];B[ge];W[he];B[hd]
(;W[ie]C[ndkrempel: Better to just connect at H14?];B[id];W[ed]
C[ndkrempel: Is this move necessary now?];B[eg]C[lcninja [11k\]: george thinks you're a 75 year old man]
;W[hg]C[Raine [?\]: I'm not sure if that's a compliment or not.
lcninja [11k\]: I'm not sure either

;B[jg];W[gi];B[ki];W[dg]
(;B[fg]C[Raine [?\]: Still think that group is weak?
lcninja [11k\]: yes

ndkrempel: This move ignores the bad aji at B11 as the game shows,
so it's better to play B14.];W[bi];B[bf]C[Raine [?\]: Bathroom]
;W[ci]C[lcninja [11k\]: wow this is a complicated kill.  I'll give you that

What about reducing from the outside and then invading at 3-3 instead?

Raine [?\]: Okay, hold on...

-----

As you can see, we played another game from this position due to our disagreement.  It ended before a result was reached.  My question:  Who is ahead in this position?

ndkrempel: Ok, let's evaluate this position.

Firstly I should say that the sequence at the top right would be good
for black if he already had a stone around Q9, but as white has sente,
white will play there immediately (R10 probably), making black's thickness less
valuable than white's territory.

In the top left, white has some territory while black is a little thin
with some bad aji from the D12 stone.

The bottom right and bottom left are roughly equal.

So that leaves white ahead.]))))
