C[Anything would be great. But I know I really need help with my middle game. My begining game is okay and I can usually make up a few points in the end game but my middle is where I lose all my points.

dada: See my summary at the end. It hurts seeing you play the empty triangle and worthless points throughout the game. You will easily gain in strength if you avoid such plays in the future.]
;B[dp]C[dada: so far so good :o)

I try to concentrate on some basic principals, so I am not going to comment on every black move I find dubious.]
;W[oo];B[qc];W[ee];B[qh];W[eo];B[pq]LB[do:A][ep:B]C[dada: Ok, but I suggest reacting to White's move by playing 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[ld];B[ke]LB[od:A]C[dada: What is the purpose of this move? This move does not achieve anything. If you reply to White's move you should play at 'A'.]
;W[je];B[kd]C[dada: good! Keep White separated.];W[kf];B[jd]
LB[le:A]C[dada: I'd prefer 'A', but this move is playable.]
;W[id];B[le];W[me];B[lf];W[kg];B[mf];W[nf];B[md];W[lc];B[ne]
C[dada: Black is doing well, whereas White has not really achieved much and still has cutting points everywhere.]
;W[ng];B[nd]TR[md][ne]C[dada: BAD!! Repeat after me: this is bad.

The marked stones form an empty triangle.
(See http://senseis.xmp.net/?EmptyTriangle)

*Never* play an empty triangle, unless you really know what you are doing. This move is close to playing a pass move.

If you learn nothing else from this review, remember this: do not play an empty triangle.]
;W[jc];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb]
(;B[mc]C[dada: small and unnecessary. See variation.];W[lg]
;B[mg];W[mh];B[mb]TR[lb][mc]C[dada: Bad! Empty triangle (marked) and unnecessary (pass move.) What were you afraid of?]
;W[ic];B[of]TR[nf][ng]LB[nh:A]C[dada: better play at 'A' and cut off White's marked stones.]
;W[og];B[pg];W[pf];B[oe];W[ph];B[qg];W[qi];B[oh]C[dada: good. White's moves are unreasonable.]
;W[nh];B[pi];W[oi];B[ph];W[pj];B[qf]LB[ni:A][oj:B][qj:C]C[dada: small. White has cutting points everywhere - you should be more aggressive.]
;W[ri];B[rh]TR[qh][qg]LB[qo:A]C[dada: no, too small in this stage of the game. You really should play 'A'.

And guess what: it's an empty triangle.];W[si];B[pe]C[dada: capturing this stone is like passing. There was no danger at all. You just wasted a move.]
;W[qj];B[ka]LB[qo:A][ep:B][do:C][cd:D]C[dada: no. This is an endgame play. You really have many good points to play. Most urgent: 'A'. But the other moves are ok as well.]
;W[ja];B[la];W[sh];B[sg];W[sf];B[rg];W[re];B[sd]C[dada: actually you should have ignored White. White will not live here, no matter how hard he tries.]
;W[rf];B[qe]C[dada: unnecessary. I know you are afraid of an atari here, but it does not accomplish anything for White.]
;W[ni]C[dada: so let's see: by playing some empty triangles and pass moves you helped White in fixing up his shape. No more easy cutting points remain.

White has good influence all over the board and all you got is some 30 points in the corner.]
;B[rd]LB[qo:A]C[dada: No!!! This is another pass move. White's stones are dead. Why do you play a move to capture them? 'A' is much better.]
;W[oj];B[mo]LB[qo:A]C[dada: wrong direction. Again: 'A' is better.]
;W[mn];B[ln];W[lm];B[mm]LB[lo:A]C[dada: Better to protect your cutting point by playing 'A'.]
;W[nn];B[nm]MA[ni][oi][oj][pj][qj][mh][nh][kg][lg]C[dada: bad move. This is the wrong side for the fight. This will not end well ...

... because Black has nowhere to run to, because of the strong White wall above (marked.)]
;W[om];B[ll];W[km];B[no];W[on];B[lo];W[ml];B[nl];W[mk];B[ol]
LB[op:A]C[dada: these stones are lost. You should play at 'A' to link up your stones to the corner.]
;W[pl];B[nj]C[dada: ???];W[mj];B[pk]C[dada: ???];W[ok];B[qk]
;W[ql];B[pp]LB[op:A]C[dada: better at 'A' linking up. This way White still can cut you into two.]
;W[rk];B[kl]MA[pp]LB[op:A][ep:B]C[dada: you are not strong enough in this area to fight like this. If the marked stone were at 'A' I'd play 'B' now.]
;W[jl];B[kk]TR[ll][kl]MA[jk][jj][ji][jh]C[dada: empty triangle!

Where are you going to run? If white keeps on playing on the marked points you directly run into White's wall and your stones die.]
;W[jj]C[dada: mistake by White.];B[jk];W[ik];B[jm]C[dada: ... and you are saved. You have been lucky here.]
;W[nk];B[il];W[hl];B[im]TR[jm][il]LB[kn:A][jn:B][hm:C][jo:D]
C[dada: do I need to tell you what I think of this move?

Actually, any other move (A to D) I can possibly think of is better.]
;W[hm];B[kn];W[mm];B[jn]TR[im][jm]LB[io:A][hn:B]C[dada: wrong shape (and empty triangle.) If you like to protect this cut, then play at 'A' or 'B' instead.]
;W[hk];B[kj]C[dada: small. You are not achieving anything with this move. The left side is wide open. Play there. Or play in a corner.]
;W[ki];B[li]C[dada: ???];W[kh];B[lj];W[ji];B[lh]C[dada: Why? White is already alive on the right and strong on the left. This is a pass move.]
;W[jf];B[mi]C[dada: another pass move. This is yet another wasted move.]
;W[np];B[mp]TR[pp]LB[op:A]C[dada: cutting at 'A' is the only move. I hope you see now how bad the marked move was.]
;W[op]C[dada: and Black is split into two.];B[nq];W[oq];B[or]
;W[pr]LB[nr:A]C[dada: White makes a mistake (better at 'A')]
;B[mr];W[os];B[nr];W[ps]C[dada: another mistake by White. This is your chance.]

(;B[ns]C[dada: I'd play the variation instead, but ok.];W[qp]
;B[po]C[dada: ok];W[qn];B[qq];W[rq];B[qr];W[rp];B[rr]C[dada: too small - this is an endgame move. Play on the left side instead.]
;W[sr];B[qs]C[dada: close to being a pass move. White could not have escaped anyway. You are again capturing dead stones.]
;W[sq];B[qo];W[ro];B[pn]C[dada: small - endgame];W[rn];B[pm]
;W[qm];B[rs]C[dada: Pass move, wasted.];W[ss]C[dada: same for White. Two worthless moves in a row.]
;B[gn]LB[hn:A][go:B]C[dada: better stay connected with a play at either 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[fm];B[gm]LB[hn:A]C[dada: better to link up at 'A' instead.]
;W[gl];B[fn];W[en];B[em]LB[hn:A]C[dada: looks to aggressive to me. White 'A' can cause trouble later on.]
;W[fl];B[dn]C[dada: too aggressive];W[dm];B[el];W[hn]C[dada: there you are ...]
;B[go];W[gp];B[ho];W[io]C[dada: White helps you to your feet again.]
;B[hp];W[ip];B[fp];W[gq]
(;B[fo]LB[hq:A]C[dada: ok, but I like 'A' better. White cannot cut here anyway (see variation)]
;W[ek];B[dl];W[cm];B[do];W[ck];B[ep]LB[in:A]C[dada: too small. The stones were already captured. If you play around here, then cut at 'A' instead.]
;W[cl];B[dk]C[dada: no. Never push where you cannot cut.];W[dj]
;B[en];W[ej]C[dada: see? You only made White stronger.];B[hq]
MA[io][ip]LB[in:A]C[dada: should be at 'A' and capture the marked stones.]
;W[iq];B[gr]LB[in:A]C[dada: 'A'! There is nothing to be afraid of.]
;W[in];B[fq]LB[ir:A]C[dada: another pass move. If you play in this area (what you should not do) then at least play at 'A' instead.]
;W[cj];B[cn]C[dada: too small right now. You have to play in the upper left corner.]
;W[bn];B[bo];W[bm];B[an]C[dada: way too small!];W[am];B[ao]
;W[ir];B[is]C[dada: ???];W[js];B[hs];W[jr];B[ps]C[dada: ok.]
;W[kp];B[lq]C[dada: too small, you already have two eyes.

Upper left corner is much bigger. This is true for both Black and White for all following moves in this area.]
;W[kr];B[lp];W[ls];B[lr];W[jo];B[kq];W[jq];B[ko];W[jp];B[ms]
C[dada: just to illustrate this:

this move is worth 0,5 points. That's half a point.
A play in the upper left corner is worth at least 25 points.]
;W[ks]C[dada: well, at least White makes the same mistakes as you.]
;B[hr];W[ij];B[dd]LB[cd:A][cc:B]C[dada: finally! Although I'd prefer 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[de];B[ec];W[fd];B[fc];W[gc];B[ce];W[cf];B[bf]LB[cd:A]C[dada: too aggressive. I'd play at 'A' instead and protect the cutting point.]
;W[df];B[bg];W[cg];B[ch];W[dh];B[ci];W[di];B[bh]TR[ch][ci]LB[cd:A]
C[dada: empty triangle. The real problem is the cutting point at 'A' - protecting this cutting point with a move at 'A' is urgent!]
;W[fb];B[eb];W[gb];B[ed]TR[dd][ec]LB[cd:A]C[dada: not good: empty triangle and cutting point at 'A' remains.]
;W[cd]C[dada: ouch!];B[be];W[cc];B[cb];W[bb];B[bd];W[db]
(;B[da]C[dada: there is nothing you can do here. Instead I'd play the variation.]
;W[ca];B[bc];W[ea];B[ac]C[dada: ok. Makes life as well.];W[ab]
;B[ai]LB[bj:A]C[dada: better at 'A'];W[bj];B[aj];W[ak];B[bi]
C[dada: the end. Black loses.

Black lost because of three main problems:

- playing empty triangles
- capturing already dead stones
- playing pass moves, i.e. moves worth zero points, several times.

In addition, you should protect your cuts and link up your stones before attacking. You have been too aggressive several times.

If you avoid empty triangles and capturing dead stones you will gain three or four stones in playing strength immediatly.]
