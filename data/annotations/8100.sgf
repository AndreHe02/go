C[Hi!  I'm your reviewer, I go by Flamer on KGS and you can email me at ashrestha1994@gmail.com.  If you have any questions about this review, feel free to email me (if I am on KGS I am usually in a game or not really paying attention to it, email is probably better).  For the purposes of this review, I will label all of my marks with a /before them.]
;B[dd];W[pd]C[I know that my opening goes badly, and that ultimately loses the game. I'm just not quite sure where...

/This move is fine, although I find myself more likely to play at the diagonal (Q4) to stop a diagonal fuseki game.  Personal choice, you will probably find one or the other more appealing to you.]
;B[dq];W[pq]LB[qk:A]C[/This is a questionable move for white, because the Low Chinese Fuseki (Followed up with a stone at A) requires that you have sente after placing Q3.  Otherwise black can come in at A, leaving your bottom right corner to attack.  This is still playable, but I find it is less advantageous than if you are black playing it.  Not a huge problem though.]
;B[nc];W[qf];B[jc];W[cf];B[nr]LB[po:B][qo:A][lq:C]C[/This approach is rather uncommon in my experience.  Probably an invention of black..  I didn't find it on Josekipedia, which lists most of the favorable and common approaches to corners.  Notice how he is low.  Use that to your advantage.  Your move, A, plays to keep the corner.  But he isn't attacking your corner, he is trying to take your side.  Two options.  B is higher.  Click on B to see the follow up and explanation.  Alternatively, you can pincer at C.  It could leave you for attack at A or B, but it either kills the O2 stone or at least ensures you profit.]
(;W[qo];B[np]
(;W[on]LB[fc:A][ci:B][ql:D][mq:C]C[should this be one space over (O6), or somewhere else altogether?

/This move COULD get you a lot.  But, as of now, I don't like it.  If he responds, he can only gain more at the bottom because of how high your stone is.  Your right, which would also expand, doesn't have an upper boundary around P14 for this move to net you points.  If it did, this becomes more appropriate of a move, although I would have to do some intense counting to see if it would be wroth it, something you would have to ask a dan to do. 

I would ignore black O4 for now and follow up on C14 with either a double pincer (A) if you want to be aggressive, or an extension at C11 (B) if you want to gain more territory.  Others include kikashi at N3 followed by invasion (see follow up at C) or just playing for the right  (D) although that is my least favorite, as your R5 stone is low, instead of being at Q5 to warrant the extension.]
;B[cn];W[fc]C[extend down from C14 instead?
/An acceptable move depending on how safe you want to be.  I, however, think you need to deal with black's potentially huge bottom.]
;B[jp]C[/This is a big move for black because he now has the C6 stone to make the bottom huge, and the D3 area is now much stronger because of the extra stones.  You probably should have invaded earlier, instead of F17.]
;W[pj];B[eb];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[cb];W[de]C[/This is, surprisingly, a bad move.  Its hard to notice.  Black can gain very much be extending his wall.  If he goes further, then a stone at K15 becomes huge.  However, you don't control the Bottom left corner.  Therefore, your height and wall is much less useful to you.  Instead of this, save your F17 group.]
;B[ee]C[I guess now I lose F17];W[dg];B[ck];W[ci];B[pc];W[qc]
;B[pb];W[od];B[mc];W[me];B[gc];W[ed]C[poor choice?
/doesn't get you anywhere.  F17 is dead.];B[fe];W[fg]C[/Walls are useful, but only if you either:
A. have another wall on the other side to use with it to make territory
B. have a wall near a weak group of yours so you can escape.
C. have a wall near your enemy's weak group so you can attack.

You have no weak groups, and Black is strong at the bottom left.  There is nothing to gian with a wall here for you, but black's response can strengthen or expand his top.]
;B[fj];W[hg]C[/Again, useless wall.];B[ik]C[could I have invaded his now huge moyo instead?

/Potentially.  It is a hard invasion now, though.  When you notice that he is building something like this (and you should notice earlier) you should think of two responses:
1. an invasion, pretty standard.
2. a way to get near it without letting him respond.  Think weak group that happens to extend near his territory, or a fight that takes your stones near his.  Basically, force him to let you approach so you can extend in.  I would have made sure I had a stole around L7 somehow, so that I could move in to J7, at the least.]
;W[ln]C[/This is obvious what you are doing, and while it DOES let you move in to two spaces (M4 and K6) it is less effective than if you had moved further in, and if you had done that earlier.  Also, i don't know how credbile a reduction at M4 is anyway because the 2 point jump is already a weak connection, another 1 point jump makes it easily cuttable.]
;B[jn];W[lk];B[he];W[jf]C[/This move is okay, so long as you are aiming for territory around N12.]
;B[je];W[ke];B[ie];W[lp];B[lq];W[ko]C[/This is a bad move.  Don't demand that he get thicker.  Instead, leave him with a few holes you might get a chance to exploit somehow later.  I hate to say it, but before you hit high pro games, and even in pro games, Go has some luck in it.  Maybe in the midst of a fight you happened to play a stone that you later extend to and save a group.  You might want to look up what kikashi is to further understand what i mean by luck.]

(;B[or];W[qr];B[kj];W[lj];B[ki];W[li];B[kl];W[ll]C[the wall is formed and the game is lost...?

/Yes, and no.  You could still invade, but it would be difficult, and some consider it bad manners to invade without a plan.  And frankly, a plan would be difficult to come up with here.  But, you could try it, although I would just accept my loss.]
;B[km]C[/The rest of this game is just yose.  You should try harder to count how many points you can gain in a givern area.  The upper right corner is huge in terms of end game, a difference in something like 8 points.  At the very least, keep sente in mind and make sure your moves keep sente on your side.

I don't have much to say from here on in.  Your opening game gave black a large bottom left moyo which you should have invaded much earlier.]
