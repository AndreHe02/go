C[<W> I had played a good streak winning alot against 3kyu's, when this game was played, and right from the opening I was all lost. What I am mainly looking for is strategical advice; many of the tactical blunders I can spot on my own and learn from, but the big patterns totally elude me. I have mainly marked all the mistakes I noticed on my own or should have noticed in the actual game. It's hard to comment on my thoughts as I didn't really know what I was doing for most of the game.

schwa: I don't really know what I'm doing most of the time, either.  I think you have to be a pro, or at least 5 or 6 dan, to be at that level!  The key (at 3kyu or 3dan) is just to fake it better than your opponent :)]
;B[jj]C[<W> How does tengen games usually develop? What special openings and patterns should I consider when my opponents start like this??

schwa: 
You don't want to create a moyo game; make small territories, or even better let the opponent get some small territories until you have made some thickness to counter the influence of this stone.]
;W[pp]C[4-4 point seems like an OK choice -- aim at giving the opponent a small territory and taking some influence.  Think about influence, NOT moyo, and this is a good move.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[Now it seems like you're thinking about a moyo?  The K4 point where your stones want to work together is somewhat neutralized by the influence of K10.  You could play C4 aiming at a pincer after black's approach move or at D3 aiming to give black some corner territory while you get a strong group in the lower left.]
;B[dd];W[jp]C[This seems to be turning into a moyo game where K10 can do its work.  Not that this is a bad game for W, but it certainly goes along with black's idea.]
;B[pn]LB[np:B][qp:A]C[Unusual move for black; W can get sente and break up the upper side moyo.  On the other hand I suppose K16 is too ordinary for black.  Hm.  I think I would play around Q13 area, sort of like a chinese fuseki idea.]

(;W[qp]C[This is surely a mistake, taking territory and letting black get influence.  O4 is almost mandatory here.]
;B[nn];W[np];B[pj]C[In the joseki if black plays R4 white has sente (black does not get Q10).  This is where black gains a lot.  See variation a few moves back.]
;W[nc]C[This is invading the strong side of black's area: like beating your head on a wall.  Now you will get a tiny corner group and black's moyo becomes VERY powerful.  You want to approach more leisurely at K17 or perhaps at F17 (though that might make K16 too easy for black, so I like K17)]
;B[jd];W[pb];B[qc]LB[lc:B][ne:A]
(;W[ne];B[pf];W[kb]C[This looks like a joseki shape with K16 at L16 but here black has K18 later.  White joseki is M17 aiming at K18, I think.  Then from M17 you can ump to N14 later instead of just O15.

See variation a few moves back.];B[jb]C[Too soon for black to play this move, I think the center is more important than the edge (black should play D10 or approach C6 or D6)]
;W[kc];B[jc]C[<W> Here I am very satisfied.

Yes, K18 is a good move for black later but not yet!];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[qi]C[This looks like an overplay: black gets strong on the outside and your group in the top is not really all that strong.

If you're thinking that linking up the side for life and using the S6 threat for life are miai, maybe ok.

I still think that D10 area is bigger.];B[qj];W[ph];B[oh];W[pg]
;B[og];W[qf];B[ri];W[rh];B[pi];W[qh];B[rj];W[qd];B[pc];W[of]
;B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[rg];B[ob]C[<W> Missed this, my goal was to kill black...

Definitely an overplay: black is stronger in this area than white, so trying to kill black is silly.

After losing this stone, your upper side group is weak, and you are in trouble.  Meanwhile you gained two points on the right side.  True, you destroyed black's potential there but meanwhile he got more outside potential plus solidified his corner.]
;W[nb];B[qb];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[ld]C[but black makes an overplay too instead of using the threats.

Again D10 is seen to be very big.  If black had D10 then obviously L13 here would be a good move to work with that stone.]
;W[kd];B[ke];W[le];B[md];W[lb];B[nd];W[oc];B[pa];W[od];B[dj]
C[Finally someone finds the big point.  B takes the lead.];W[mh]
C[This move is too slow: you are behind and have to do something bigger.  Black's stones here are too strong to gain by leaning on them like this.]
;B[df]C[Black is trying to solidify a HUGE upper left corner.  This move is not solid enough, though, you can still play D17.  Black should try C15 instead I think.]
;W[om]C[Black is not going to die here: again you are attacking, but again you won't gain any points by doing so.]
;B[cn]C[Black sees that you could have played S6 anyway (linked up to R4) and he can play S6 (linked up to S10) so the Q6 stone is not very valueable.]
;W[mm];B[nj]C[<W> Obvious shape move I missed.

Yes, necessary once white starts getting close to killing.

If white plays O10 sooner, though, it's not big: black can sacrifice O12 stones and make life on the side with S6.]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[mk];B[nm];W[nl];B[ol];W[ml];B[pm]C[<W> How did P7 become so useless?

You followed it with N7, saying that you wanted to make this wall.  You got the wall you wanted!  If you wanted P7 to be the important stone, then you should have played P6 after black ignored the peep.

Now you have your wall, so use it!];W[pl];B[ok];W[ql];B[rm]
;W[mn];B[fq]C[meanwhile, count how much you gained/lost on the right side while black gained D10, D14, C6, F3 on the left side.  Seems like black is coming out ahead in these exchanges.

You're going to have to stage a big invasion (like D12) using your wall down the N column as support.]
;W[fp];B[cq]C[Isn't joseki for black to play G4 first?  Exchange G4 for F5?]
;W[dq]C[D3 is not the shape move, is it?  I'd be tempted  to play C4??  Not sure what's best for white here.  E3 also looks tempting.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[dn];W[co]C[This move helps black, removes the aji of peeping at B5 later, uses up one of white's liberties.  Almost always a bad move.  Only play B5 if your next move is going to use black's short liberties (like C2, B4, B6).  Otherwise, no reason to play here: it's not like black is going to spend a move to play C5 himself!]
;B[bo];W[fn];B[hq]LB[gp:B][cr:A]C[white gives up even more territory but is getting strong on the outside now -- maybe D12 invasion really will work!]

(;W[in];B[jo]LB[jn:A][kp:B]
(;W[jn];B[kp]C[This is too much to allow, black gains hugely here.  Compare the value of L4 with the value of C2.]
;W[jq];B[kq];W[ko];B[jr]C[<W> How should I have handled this better?
I did notice the rather nice influence towards the center, and figured I could attack heavilly on the top and left. I probably start in the wrong area...

schwa: The influence is good but you have lost too much.
C2 was a mistake.  See variations in the previous few moves.]
;W[lp];B[lq];W[mp];B[br]C[White's territory is gone.  It is time to resign.  Black B2 is not the best, though: E17, securing this area, would seem to guarantee black's win more quickly.  Or a defensive move like C12.]
;W[je]LB[ie:B][ep:A]C[<W>... namely here. Should I do something like C17 first?

here, black can give up L15 and still win.  See variation.]

(;B[ep]C[Black shouldn't be looking for trouble like this.  The complications here could be bad.  Black is winning, should play simply.]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[rl];B[qm];W[fp];B[kf]C[<W> This was what I wanted all along. Black can easilly get into trouble trying to save every stone.

Yes, white is lucky that black makes the game more complicated.]
;W[eq];B[dc]C[<W> Too late for the corner...

Black's gain from L14 and D17 is bigger than white's gain on the bottom.  White is way behind.]

(;W[lf]LB[lf:A][kg:B]C[<W> Embarrasing that I didn't see this ladder, having just been trough a problem book focusing on such problems...

Yup, that's a big difference to the game!  Black made a mistake not to play at the key point (L13) himself instead of M13.]
;B[kg];W[jg];B[li]LB[ki:B][ni:A]C[I think white missed another chance to kill here.]

(;W[ni];B[oi];W[mi]C[O11-P11 is another wasted exchange.  Since you need N11 anyway, just play there.  O11-P11 is like C5-B5.  Leave those unplayed until you need them.  If nothing else, they make good ko threats.]
;B[ki]C[W L11 would have been nice (see variation a few moves ago).]
;W[hi]C[Good desperation move for white: maybe this whole black group dies.  White could get a big center.  This is the right kind of move to make when you are losing.]
;B[jh];W[ih];B[ig]C[but black's shape looks too good, and white's has so many problems.]

;W[hh];B[hb]LB[gb:A][ik:B]
(;W[gb]C[<W> Am I too greedy here? Should I just play J10 H9 or something?

I think J9 is the vital point.  Black is reduced to effectively 3 liberties then I think (since white L10 is possible?)]

(;B[ge]LB[ic:C][id:B][ge:A];W[id];B[hj];W[gj]C[<W> I did not really see any way out here, the next 30 or so moves is pure desperation, trying hard to look for a way to kill, and in the process digging myself deeper.

Was I in so much trouble that this desperation was warranted?

schwa:
Think about it like this:
if you sacrifice the 4 stones, how much other territory do you need in order to win the game?

Looks to me like even after your gains on the top, you'd have to destroy the whole left side to catch up.  Or destroy most of it and get sente to play N2 first before black gets O2.  That is, white needs to catch up by 20+ points.  So, invade C12 and maybe sacrifice H12 stones?]

Yes, black needs to count liberties more carefully!

White has indeed taken the lead.  Capture is pretty big plus the territory from F7/8 to M7/8 is not bad either.]

I realize this might not be the best review matterial, but I hope it's atleast some insight into how I play, and that you are able to spot the flaws I cannot see myself in the way I play.

schwa:
seems you put too much importance on territory (R4) and on taking away opponent's area too soon (R11) instead of looking for balance on the outside.

Also avoid playing sente moves (C5, O11) just for sente's sake: play them only if you need them!

FInally, do some studying of shape (e.g. move 144, where you could take a vital point and kill black's center group easily while saving your own).

I hope my comments are helpful and I also hope you'll let me know all the mistakes I've made in them!  The player of a game always sees some things that a more relaxed observer might miss.
