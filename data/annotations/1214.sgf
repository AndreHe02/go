;B[pd]C[dear reviewer,

i played w in this game.  i won in the end  thanks to komi (5.5), and i'd like to know  whether there were places where i could've  made better, more effective moves.

thanks!

cheers,

Hi!

First of all I want to apologize. I was on  vacation for the past 3 weeks and didn't  have time to check my mail. GTL sent your  game to a different reviewer but this  probably took longer then you expected.  Well, to make it up to you I'll do the review  anyway so you'll get two reviews of the  same game :). It'll give you an opportunity to  compare the suggestions and perhaps get  a good laugh when you compare the two  reviews. Usually when two people review  the same game they disagree on almost  everything :).
O.k. don't take anything you read from  us amateurs for granted (actually pro's can  sometimes be wrong too) we're just as  clueless as you are. I'll try to explain my  choices of moves with variations but in the  end it's up to you to make up your mind  whether or not you agree o.k.?  I'll comment on both b & w (It's easier for  me) so send this review to your opponent if  you have the time. I use Hibiscus go  for my reviews so I hope the markings  and variations will work for you.
O.k. lets get started.];W[dp];B[pp];W[cc];B[pj]C[Good choice. Takemia 9p uses this as  mojo building strategy. San-ren-sei is  actually used for fighting. Usually if  an opponent plays this he's a fighter.]

(;W[nq]LB[nq:6][nc:A]C[This is o.k. although in most pro games A  is preferred. This is a matter of personal  preference I guess but to get philosophical  here for a sec...
Black played san-ren-sei so his formation  is all  power. W's 3,3 stone in the upper-left is a  common target for a shoulder hit (on 4,4)  which makes san-ren-sei really work.  Therefore w usually attaches at A to lend  some support for his 3,3 stone.]

(;B[np]LB[np:7][lq:A][pn:B]C[Usually A or B (see vars.) This joseki is  rarely played.
By attaching like this you build strength for  both players but black doesn't need more  strength as he played 3 moves on the 4th  line already.]
;W[mp]
(;B[op]C[i wasn't sure what to do  at this point.  thought  about n5, but that would  seem to give b sente  (for, say, r16) since w'd  need to protect against  n3 cut (var 2).  thus 2  questions:  is the above  reasoning correct?  and  is what w actually played  (b3) ok?

Well in go nothing is  sente o.k.? Sente just  means you value a  defensive move here  more than any other  move on the board. And  to answer your question  no - white doesn't need to  protect the n3 cut. see  vars...

B (9) is a bad move for  the same reason. When  you look at it - it doesn't  really protect the corner  as o3 would and it  makes the cut at n3  small (as it is gote).  Anyway if a move is not  in your joseki book  there's usually  something wrong with it.  That doesn't mean you  should blindly stick to  joseki but joseki moves  are deeply thought out  and there's a reason for  every move. See  variations...]

(;W[mq]C[Well I think w n5 was a  much better idea... see  var.]
;B[mo]
(;W[pr]C[White should hane at m5.  See var.];B[lo]C[Good for black. Exchanging  w (12) on the 2nd line for  b (13) on the 5th is  clearly better for black.]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[rq]
(;B[rp]C[If you studied the  previous variations  you'll know what I have  to say about b (17) :)
See var...];W[nj]C[felt this might be a little  premature, but it worked  out okay, i think.

Yes this is way early.  And you were quite  lucky...]
(;B[nk]C[Use thickness for  attacking not for  enclosing territory...
See var...];W[oj];B[ok];W[pi];B[qi]C[Imagine this inverted!
See previous var...];W[qj];B[pk];W[qh];B[ri]C[didn't think it  through...but now it looks  as if w could've pushed  down at s12...

Yes but it is rarely a  good idea to give up  sente for that...

See vars...]
(;W[oh];B[rh]LB[rh:29][nd:A]C[I'd rather see this at A. Black  is gaining small pts. (1  point per move actually)  while making his corner  weaker.]
;W[qg];B[rg]C[And again...];W[qf];B[re]C[This doesn't establish a  connection jet.]

(;W[pb]LB[pb:34][mj:A]C[This turned out o.k. but  Pls. see var.]
;B[qe]LB[qe:35][oc:A]C[I'd rather play at A  turning tables on white.  White will have to live on a  small scale in the corner  while black will get to attack  his center group.]
;W[nc]C[nice breathing space];B[mj]C[Good - a hane at the  head of two stones is  according to a go  proverb never bad.]
;W[nh]LB[nh:38][mh:A]C[I'd rather see this at A.];B[nd]C[Good rhythm. This secures  white on the top but is great  for the attack of the  center group - this shows  some whole board  perspective...]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[mh]LB[mh:43][lh:A]C[Shape-wise this should  be at A. White may have  easier time living locally  but it would just about  prevent him from  escaping.]
;W[mg]C[And white would not get this  hane.];B[ni]C[Now black will have to go for  small profit.]
;W[lh];B[oi]LB[oi:47][mi:A][ng:B]C[Connecting at A would be  much better as:
1. white wouldn't get his  ponnuki
2. black still gets to take  these two stones as w  cannot connect them  until he secures the cut  at B.]
;W[mi]
(;B[ph]C[liked the exchange here


White should be happy...
see var.];W[ld]C[And yes this is indeed an  excellent point.  Money-wise black has about  40 pts on the right while  white has about 15-20 pts  with his two groups  (top&bottom) and his  side intact (I'd say  5-10 pts for each corner)  plus komi.  White also has the potential  for expanding his top  side while black has no  similar potential. White is  clearly winning.

Homework: spot the  weakness in whites wall  (m17-m12).]
(;B[dd]C[maybe b should've approached from the  left, say d14 or c15?

This seems appropriate. See var.];W[dc]LB[dc:52][ed:1][be:2]
[ec:3][df:4][hc:5]C[should w have played some kind of pincer  from the right?    w's direction is correct?

This is the correct direction. I don't think  there is a pincer against a shoulder hit  anyway :).

The direction comes from the 1-5 joseki  sequence - this leaves black facing white  thickness and white with a possibility of  building the left side. Black group is still  unsafe.]

(;B[cd]C[However black will diverge and play a  different joseki. see var.]
;W[ed]C[Good];B[ee];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[df]LB[df:59]C[is d14 necessary?  feels b's too slow.  or  is b being properly cautious?  could some  kind of larger extension have worked for b?

In a way yes. B (53) is not a joseki move  so black got into trouble but not defending  against this cut would mean a further loss  for black who is behind anyway. The best  thing  for black is to wait for a chance and play  thick  moves like this.]
;W[cj]LB[cj:60][dj:A]C[I'd rather see this at A. As black played a  thick move approaching to close is bad.  When approaching strength it is always  worth considering playing higher rather  then lower.]

(;B[ci]C[Making contact with your opponents stones  makes both of you stronger. While you  both get stronger white is further away from  his hoshi stone then black is from his  group. This means that white stones are  working more efficiently than b's.

See var.];W[dj];B[fq]LB[fq:63]C[The marked exchange is now clearly a bad  one for black.]
;W[fp]C[Didn't quite understand the e5 sequence  you wrote (did you mean e3,f4,d5?) but  your reasoning is somewhat correct. white  is  trying to build his left side. The bottom  side is small for both as white has n3,n4  and black  has m5 stone in place neither player can  get big territory there.]
;B[eq]C[Correct - black has to resort to emergency  measures.]
;W[ep];B[dq];W[cq];B[cr];W[bq];B[br]
(;W[jq]C[A mistake. As I pointed out bottom is a  small area for now. Building up your left  side or your top side should take  priority.]
;B[gp];W[go];B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq]C[With this black is somewhat back in the  game.  This is bigger then it looks as it completely  secures black group on the expense of w's  territory.]
;W[di];B[ch];W[ho]
(;B[em]LB[em:83][fl:A]C[This is too deep so it is an overplay. White  has just extended to h5 and that should  mean something. When invading always  consider this:
Can I live there independently?
Do I have at least two ways out?
If white next plays A black exit is blocked  and  there's little chance of him living inside  so...

See var for your suggestion.];W[en];B[fm];W[fn];B[dm];W[gk]
;B[gl]LB[gl:89][hm:A]C[Simply jumping out would be better. With  (89) you are just helping white gain  strength in  the center.]
;W[hl];B[hm];W[il];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[fi];B[im];W[hi]LB[hi:98]
[gi:A]C[If you're protecting it is usualy better to  play A as it is thicker and gives less  forcing moves to black.

After a series of bad moves by white (you  didn't handle black invasions very well and  playing k3 also hurt your position) black  got back into the game.]
;B[jl];W[lj];B[lk];W[kk];B[kl]LB[kl:10][kj:A]C[Cutting at A would be more interesting.]
;W[ll];B[mk];W[jk]C[I saw your comment on time trouble and  checked it out - I do not recommend playing  1min games. Go is about skill, intuition and  reading. Playing a longer game where you  win on strategy and not you opponents  mistakes is much more enjoyable. Also  those games give less for me to comment  on :).]
;B[jn]LB[jn:10][kj:A][kq:B]C[I tried some variations with A and B for  black but they seem to dangerous so  perhaps defending and waiting for a  chance is best here.]
;W[gq]C[And here it comes. White should definitely  protect the center. And incidentally what did  you plan to do if black did pull out his  stone?]
;B[kj]C[Good.]

Black should study joseki as he fell behind  in the opening. White didn't really know  how to handle black invasions and black  got back into the game. The biggest  strategic mistake was playing at k3  instead of building up the left or the top  side and failing to protect the center. Black  on the other hand missed his chance to  brake up the center which would have won  him the game.
I hope you find my review interesting to  read. You both missed some chances in  the endgame but that is probably due to  time restrictions (play longer games!).

;W[ed]LB[ed:16][rp:A][ro:B]C[Now white has to protect his 3,3 stone (16  at f16 also possible). Thanks to the  marked stone black can B if white plays A.

Black shouldn't worry about white playing  B or a monkey jump here as that is  purely endgame and not something white  will play soon. If he does black will be  happy to build more strength in the center.  Go is mostly about the efficiency of stones  so crawling on the 2nd or 1st line is not  something you want to do in the opening.]

[qq:A][dj:D][cq:E][hq:B]C[(12) (or 1 point lower) is a kind of shimari  (corner enclosure) and this turns into a  mojo game. This variation should just  give you an idea of the follow-ups and how  to build from your position but your  opponent may disagree and invade instead  of building up his side etc...   Black structure has a weakness at A (a  standard 3,3 invasion and B at the bottom  for white to aim at. His right side is pretty  much solid and shouldn't be tampered with  unless some preparations are made  (such as thickness in the  center:) ). White on the other hand has an  opening on the left side around D but an  invasion point is hard to choose as there is  not enough space to make a two space  extension and either way your bound to  secure the lower-left corner. On the other  hand white has at least secured one  corner. B and E are similar invasion points  but both suffer from D and E so it is easy  for the opponent to settle his stones in the  corner.]
