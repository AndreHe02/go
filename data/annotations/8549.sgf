C[Hello!

My name is Bernd, I am HonFu in the GTL and in other go places.

So let's see what we got here!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]
;W[fq];B[np]C[Hon: This looks a bit patient, but might be okay.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd];W[de];B[bf]
;W[eg];B[cj]LB[lc:B][bp:A][jq:C]C[Hon: This is a strange move, right in front of the settled position.

A, B or C instead look like logical points.];W[cl]LB[co:A][po:B]
C[I think Black's move is dubious.
Probably I should just tenuki in this area or play at A/B?

Hon: B is too deep, you got to find a safer way for reducing. But A instead of C8 looks like a good idea since black's stone is in a silly place.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dl]
(;W[dk]LB[dn:A]C[I wanted to seperate, but probably A is better to create influence.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[do];W[cp];B[dm];W[ck]C[Hon: The result is not so great for black, but this time you are standing in the unimportant place, so it looks better for him than my variation, where he remains to be in the silly place.]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[ej];W[ei];B[gk];W[fm];B[fl];W[em];B[el];W[eo]
;B[fi];W[dn];B[cm];W[eh]
(;B[gm]C[Hon: Too slow.];W[jp];B[fn]C[Hon: Again too slow. Of course you don't answer.]
;W[po]C[Hon: Looks too deep.]
(;B[qp];W[no];B[mo];W[nn];B[mn];W[ok]LB[pl:B][nm:A]C[A seems necessary.

Hon: Playing lightly within his influence is a good idea. A looks heavy. But the problem seems to be that Q5 was too deep. This point here or B was a better place to start.]
;B[nm];W[om];B[on];W[pm];B[oo]C[Hon: Ouch.]
(;W[nl];B[pi];W[qc]LB[ne:A][lq:B]C[Invasion to early?
Better at A or B?

Hon: Perfect timing, since now is your last chance.

I am worried about your group in the lower right though.];B[pc]

;W[kp];B[kq];W[go];B[nd]
(;W[mc];B[md];W[kc]C[Hon: Saving O17 immediately is gote and was maybe too early.]
;B[cb]C[Hon: Shame black got this point.];W[db];B[da];W[ea]
;B[ca];W[fb];B[ld];W[lc];B[jf];W[ke];B[hf];W[hd]
(;B[gg]
(;W[kf];B[ni];W[ll]
(;B[mm]C[Hon: No more comments from here on since black doesn't try to kill you and from then it's only endgame.

Basically the biggest trouble in this game for you was the failed sabaki in the lower right. You must leave a local quarrel with good shape, otherwise you're in trouble!

The matter on the left side was a good example. This side was uninteresting, because it was open at the bottom and the upper left was already solid. Remember for these kind of positions - if your opponent plays at a silly spot where he doesn't create or destroy a lot, you don't have to attack him hard. Rather give him what he wants with open hands! It will only increase the shame for him of being in the wrong place!

Hope I could help you on your way!];W[lj];B[en];W[oh];B[oi]
