C[Main questions:

1) How can B invade instead of playing 27 ?
2) B could have connected 27 and 35 ?
3) How can B reduce the two W' s big territories ?
4) Aren' there many errors in the last 50 moves, in bio-yomi ?

answer to 1 at move 27
answer to 2 at move 35
answer to 3:
Black moves at O12 and maybe O5 were very important for
reducing right side.  The failed invasion of K17 and F17  makes it very hard to reduce that area, but it was possible
to keep it from growing into the center so much.

Black got off to a very good start but then lost ground.];B[pd]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[jq]C[Black seems low here. White O16];W[po]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq];W[qj]C[This looks good for Black as White is overconcentrated on right]
;B[cn];W[fq];B[bp];W[cq];B[ck];W[qf];B[nd];W[lc]C[good double approach by white]
;B[mc]C[induces W M16 so bad for black];W[ld];B[of]C[rather than N17 play O14]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[pg];B[fc]TR[gd][gc]C[This allows W H17, a very good extension.  So play at G17 or G16

This invasion should be 1 point to right to prevent
the ideal white extension.  If White then makes a 2 space
extension on that side B is satisfied and continues with
double approach.  If White plays to the left side then it
is a new game.  B can extend to spaces to right or into  center.]
;W[hc];B[cf];W[df]C[W at E15 is better, then B will C17];B[dg]
;W[ef];B[ce];W[cd]C[B is getting settled, white is still weak here]
;B[jc]TR[lc][ld]C[B K17 is over play

35 was a very poor move.  The 2 white stones at M16,17 are quite thick, hard to attack, the black stone to the left is already weak.  Whites diagonal move prevents any connection.]
;W[gd]TR[hb]C[Good prevents connection at H18];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb]
;W[ic];B[db]C[B could save something with K18, trying to connect to either side, perhaps right after G16]
