C[I played TsuQ in this game. I usually play as a 6k, and I've been doing some study,  so I expected to be at an advantage in this 0.5 komi return game, but it seemed to go very poorly with the game being decided by endgame mistakes.

In this game, I felt like I was controlling things early. White ended up with several weak groups, and I felt good about my territory sketching. I think I'm playing a little reactively, so if you catch any instances of that it would be helpful. I think I also might have lost out somewhat by not enclosing groups when I could, prefering to chase them.... And then perhaps with poor direction of play.

I've left a large number of my own comments and variations to let you know what I was thinking to some degree, and how I think about situations in general. I'd love any input you could offer me.]
;B[pd]C[B: Your analysis is quite good: You had control of the game. Three white groups were under attack. But you didnt make much of it. You should have killed at least one white group.
What are the main points?

1.) Carry your attacks through! Do not stop and wait for later. There have been some points where you just stopped attacking when you should have continued. Train it! Play some games were your main goal is to continue the attack as long as possible.

2.) PLay more flexible. You play very solidly, which is also a virtue. But sometimes you have to trust the miai. If there are two ways to rescue your group that is good enough. You loose your tempo if you connect everything solidly.

3.) This is connected with the previous two points: Your groups were very strong in this game. whites groups were weak. You need to use your strength! The strength means you can attack more vigorously! If you are strong do not play safety oriented.  

4.) PAy attention to Sente and Gote. THere were one move in the game (move 123) were you ended in Gote and it would have been easy to end in Sente. This would have changed the game.

THis game is so full of material to discuss that I am not sure if this one series of comments is enough. Please ask back if anyrthing is not clear or if I made a mistake.]
;W[dd];B[pp];W[dp]
(;B[jc]C[This felt like a good move as the extension we would both like to make, however being low it doesn't work as well as it could with the potential moyo (with the two 4-4 stones) although I haven't developed it much yet... what do you think?

B: This move looks fine to me. I havent seen a professional play this, so in their eyes it is probably not the best. But my advise: Dont worry to much about this. For us -the amateurs- this move is fine. The problems come later.]
;W[nq]
(;B[pn]C[I thought high would work better with the 4-4 point at Q16

B: It is better to play low here. Because of the balance of low and high stones on the right side.]
;W[pr];B[qq];W[kq];B[qj]C[B: OK if you play like this, your high stone on Q6 becomes justified. Good!]
;W[qf]C[I was expecting the 3-3 invasion here for white maybe? I don't know what to think of this... it seems destined for running (although it does hurt my moyo

B: That is right. One would invade at 3-3 if one wants to invade at all. The move does not hurt your moyo. That is important to understand. Your moyo is there for attacking, not for making territory. So this white move helps you utilize your moyo. You have to be thankful for such a move. It lets your moyo shine brightly.]
(;B[qe]C[I'm not sure this is best...

B: It is one good option. This move is fine. It makes the stone of your oponent heavy.]
;W[pf]
(;B[nc]C[I didn't want to pause to fix later, and I enjoy having solid groups near the group I am attacking. Is this too passive?

B: Yes a little to passive.];W[pi];B[pj];W[od];B[oc];W[pe];B[qd]
;W[oe]C[B: All this is good for you.]
(;B[fc]C[It seems difficult to continue an attack right now so I played away]
;W[cf];B[db];W[cc]
(;B[fe]C[B: I do not understand this move. It looks inefficient to me. If you would have a stone high on N 15 it would be good. But now I dont see the meaning of this move. You are inviting white to play M14 or so, so he would get the next move to help his endangered group..]
;W[lc]C[B: white overplay. white gets two weak groups.]
(;B[md]C[Here I played to separate and maybe get a splitting attack of sorts, although Q14 doesn't look that weak...

B: good move!];W[ld]
(;B[me]C[B: a little slack.];W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[hd];W[jf]
(;B[ck]C[Looking back this seems like a mistake... certainly it is big, but continuing the attack looks stronger...

B: That is right. That is the second time you just stop in the middle of an attack. Here it really is a big mistake. white has two weak groups! This is a situation you just have to use to your advantage. I would advise that you should use your next games just to continue your attacks as long as possible (if you have strong groups). This might be  a general weakness in your play.]
;W[cm];B[ch];W[dq]C[B: strangely white is not concerned about his 3(!) very weak groups]
(;B[cb]C[At the time this seemed very natural to me... It took me a long time to question this but, although this is big and sente, maybe trying to seal white is the better direction...

B: The move is strong! White is in trouble. Your alternative E13 is a strong move as well. I like E13 better.]
(;W[bb];B[dc];W[cd]
(;B[bg]C[Again maybe wrong direction.

B: Again this is a strong move. E13 is also a good attack. Now I prefer your move B13, because it also gives a base to your stones.]
;W[dg]
(;B[dh]C[I was worried about the safety of my group, but maybe this was misguided..

B: you are right. THat is the wrong direction. Your group is strong enough.]
;W[eg]
(;B[hf]C[B: To careful. you have strong groups! Attack stronger.]
;W[if]C[B: white should play more lightly.];B[hg];W[fh];B[ej]
;W[hq]C[B: This is strange. White is not worried. Now you should kill white.]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[bl];W[co]C[Here it seems white is becoming very large... but it is also a little irrelevant to the fight which we took a tea break from. Maybe I should continue the fight instead of switching gears along with white.

B: That is right! Now is your chance to attack. Dont let it slip by!  Its the third time in this game were you decide to not attack, when you should attack! After you strengthened your group around C9 even further in Sente, you could even attack with B19, driving white out to get more strength in the center. This strength you coud then use to three different ends: Firtsly attacking the M17 group. Secondly attacking the Q14 group. Thirdly to reduce the lower side. Reducing now is not good at all.]
(;B[mp]C[Switching to reduction now might not be a good idea with the big fight still going on... and this is totally not the spot I wanted...]
;W[np]C[I really wasn't expecting this... I'm not that happy with the sequence that follows]
;B[no];W[mo]
(;B[nn];W[lo];B[ko]C[This was an odd move now that I look at it.... I was looking for a way to sell N4, but maybe I already sold it =P

B: Yes it doesnt work out.];W[kp];B[ho];W[jo];B[gp];W[gq];B[dn]
;W[cn];B[eo];W[fp];B[fo];W[hp];B[go];W[dm]
(;B[fl]C[Here I just play to connect... is it too concervative?.. Considering what I traded this seems like a really bad result.

B: Yes it is terrible. The black stones which are meant to reduce whites teritory are a burden on you. In addition they made whites territory safe.]
;W[lm];B[mj]C[B: good! Finally it is going towards an attack!]
;W[ni]
(;B[mi]C[Here... I am trying to keep white separated so I can attack K14, but after this I become too weak to attack from this side anyway... I think this had to be o10.

B: No! this is the right direction. Your move is good!  You have so many strong groups. Your central stones will fend for themselves.]
;W[nj];B[mh];W[jh]
(;B[ii]C[I think this is in too much of a hurry to enclose..

B: This is very good! How can white save his endangered groups? In addition O9 is threatening. White is in big trouble.]
;W[hh];B[ih];W[ji]
(;B[ij]TR[ih][ii]C[B: You try to play extremely solid. Every stone is connected to a living group in one way. I think your game has to become more flexible. This move is an example. you connect your marked stones to their friends below. If you play K10 you are still solid, even if it doesnt look like it. Because there is a miai for the connection: either connect up or down. The game will decide were to connect.

Another example was your move 55 B7. Your endangered group had two options: living on the side with B7 or running toward the center. So you do not have to play B7. In that case white answered and you got that safety in sente. So it was fine. But in principle it was to slow and you should have attacked.]
;W[jj]
(;B[ba];W[bf]
(;B[ee]C[This just looks so slow...

B: I like this move. It keeps white at one eye! Good! I am not sure I would have seen this excelent move. Your solidity is also a strength of yours.]
;W[cg]
(;B[ah]C[B: This connection is bad. It leaves the aji of B11. There are only very special circumstances were this is good.

Later in the game this Aji saves the life of the white central group.]
;W[bc];B[be];W[ae]
(;B[de]C[B: this exchange is not so good. Play B16 directly]
;W[ce];B[ab];W[ac]C[This exchange is also not good for black. White will play A19 in sente.]
;B[bd];W[aa];B[ca];W[fj]
(;B[gi]C[I think this might be a direction mistake, but its hard to tell...

B: This is a move that tries to deprive white of an eye in the center. I dont think this is necessary yet. white needs many moves to make an eye in the center. So: Yes it is a mistake. It helps white.]
;W[fi];B[gk];W[fk]
(;B[gl]C[I was too concerned about the G5 stones here I think... There was also a misread involved,, but I can hardly blame that..

B: What haunts you now is the bad aji of your mobve at A12]
;W[ek]
(;B[el];W[dk]
(;B[eh]C[Pay no attention to the move behind the curtain.];W[fg]
;B[dj]C[B: you only need this move because B11 is threatening. In hindside A12 was terrible.]
;W[bi];B[bh]C[I was worried about my group safety here, but I felt that if I didn't get sente I would be in trouble, so sacrificing wasn't an option

B: sure];W[dl];B[bj]C[but oddly enough I come back to defend... was it really needed?

B: I dont think it was necessary. I do not see a good attack for white. This is now very very bad for black: The attack against the white group didnt give you anything, plus you got Gote! At the end you felt to be the one who is attacked. If you feel the necessity to defend here you are not allowed to play 119 D10. In that case you should instead have played 119 B10 to get Sente. It is so important to get Sente here! You have to think about something like that at move 119. If this is not cristal clear to you think about it. Maybe it is one of the most important points of this game. If I didnt make myself understood please ask back.]
;W[kk]C[B: Ouch! Nearly all white groups are safe now.];B[ng]
C[I was pretty sure this was sente, and I was getting worried about a way to get out of here.
B: its the last group you can attack. Your last chance. So: This move is ok.]
;W[og]
(;B[im]C[B: Ouch! Again a situation were you just have to continue your attack.]

B: right.];B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[ol];B[pm];W[qr]
(;B[qh]C[Not only is this big, but I'm pretty sure it threatens to cut.

B: why not try to cut directly?];W[nh];B[nf];W[mk]C[White fixes the cut

B: Now all white groups are safe. This shouldnt have happened.]

(;B[mb]C[This turned out really badly... I can only imagine this is the wrong direction, or this should be at o18 if I can stand to play it there =\]

B: L18 is better, but this move is not so bad. white is bound to get something here, as he is between two of your territories. Just imagine White M18 instead of your move. You cannot defend both sides.]
