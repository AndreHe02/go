[cc]C[this invasion helps B in his strategy - to create a large moyo. when you go with your opponent's
strategy like this, you must be confident on how to counter it.];B[cd];W
[dc];B[ed];W[fb];B[ge];W[pf]LB[fp:A][jp:B]C[the top side is uninteresting now, because of h17 and f18 stones. When you make a shimari,
you should try to develop it in the direction orthogonal to it. here this direction is already  blocked. moreover, B can't make much territory here either, because he is open around h17.
The focus now is the lower side. an approach move like A or a big point like B would be
good moves. You should study chinese-opening-related josekis.];B[jq]C[B takes advantage of W's mistake and hits where it hurts. just watch B's position now.
W is already behind because his stones don't coordinate together as well as B's.
Still, k4 would be more consistent with B's center orientation.];W[kc]C
[Normally, a good development of your shimari; but B's position makes it easy to erase/invade
any territory you build there. also your wide shimari is more vulnerable to yosu-miru.]
;B[qo]LB[jj:A]C[totally inconsistent move. B should build his moyo (k10 would be very strong).  he has nothing to fear from a W shimari here, so blocking it is not urgent. such shimari would face B's low strong stone at k3.]
;W[mq];B[jc]LB[ke:A]C[strange. if B wants to prevent W from cutting his h17-g15 stones, he should play at A to
strebgthen them while building his moyo.
This also encourages a W 'iron pillar ' , which is very good for W.];W[kd]
;B[ie]C[severe over-concentration.];W[pl]C[good.];B[qq];W[qr];B[rq];W[qm]
;B[oo];W[nl];B[oq];W[or];B[mp];W[lq];B[lp];W[pp];B[po];W[do]TR[ge][ie][lp]
[mp][oo]C[MK: I have problems in finding a good invasion point. Is this one ok?

E: yes, a good point B invested too much in building positionsas far as the marked stones,  while the depth of his moyo can be efficiently invaded.]
;B[cm]C[see variation.
the outside direction is good in general, but it doesn't mean the first move should be outside :)
sometimes an inside move turns out to create an outside position.]
(;W[eq];B[dp];W[ep];B[eo];W[co];B[cr];W[er];B[bp];W[cp]C[W is in trouble. he should lose one of his groups.]
;B[bq];W[dn];B[fo];W[em];B[gp];W[gr];B[hq]C[should be losing move. b5 vital now.]
;W[cq];B[dr];W[ds];B[br];W[bo];B[cs];W[ap];B[aq];W[as]C[B finished.];B[ao]
;W[an]C[B is let off the hook... W should b6 ! this gives B ko.];B[bn];W
[ap];B[es];W[fs];B[ao];W[ds]C[MK: unbeliveable mistake. I really don`t understand, why I made this move.

E: true :) this is no ko threat.];B[am]C[all in all , 'justice was made' . W should be punished for letting himself be cut to 2 groups
inside B's influence.];W[gm];B[im]LB[fj:A]C[wrong direction ! e2 group is dead, so W has no cut at l4; so B is strong here. however B has no prospects for territory here ! so should attack from f10. it is not enough to attack weak groups;
Go is won by territory.];W[gh]C[too far ! is this a running extension or a new invasion ? you shoud run to f10 while erasing B's
potential territory.];B[gj];W[jh];B[ih];W[ig];B[ii];W[hg];B[jg];W[jf];B
[kg];W[kf];B[lg]C[B is right to cut and fight where he is strong, and W helps him by thin moves like g12 and k12.
however this is inelegant; m12 is better shape.];W[if];B[le];W[jd];B[ng]
;W[qi]C[MK: Is that big or does it only look big?];B[mc]LB[dh:A]C[bad. if the plan is to press the top W group, it should be done around d12. B is pushing W into his own territory, and W has enough space there and an eye at k17 (Wj17 captures) to live.
the trade off may seem ok - destroying W territory on the top in return for giving up d12, but :
1. B loses more 2. the c16 group becomes weak.];W[jb]C[W misses the chance.]
;B[eh];W[cf];B[fi];W[ci]C[extermely dangerous, unlikely to live.];B[bh]

C[can't imagine what this is for. iw W runs k12, he will be chased hard. a10 needed to finish off W.
'there is death in the hane'.];W[aj]C[MK: Is this move urgent for making a seki?

E: yes :)];B[dj];W[df];B[gg];W[jr]LB[di:A]C[W should finish the job by d11. B can still kill by playing there. see variations.]

[nn];W[op]C[B played well here, discarding unimportant stones, solidifying his position.]
;B[pd];W[od];B[qb];W[qd];B[di]C[B does not need this complication. he is winning big. It shows bad temper, trying to take all of the board when you are winning. One should aim at winning at a small but safe margin.]
