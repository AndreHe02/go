mic [19k\]: Hi, good game

*******************************

Hi there,

my name is Rainer (9k) and I did the review of your game.

First I would like to say something about handicap games in general. If you are the one who gets some handicap stones, your opponent's ability in the game is usually greater than your own. Therefore the proverb "Don't touch a stone you are attacking" gets an even greater meaning, because your opponent's ability to fight is, most of the time, more advanced than your's.
To put white under pressure is good, but you have to respect the ability of your opponent and try to build more solid positions that are harder to invade for white.

I made comments and suggestions throughout the game. These suggestions are no strict directions but only hints for future plays.

One word to the counting of territory at the end of the game. The groups you both thought seki are not. I changed the result accordingly from B+0,5 to B+20,5

I hope my review will help you in your future games.

Best regards,

Rainer (Beholder on KGS)];W[jp];B[mq];W[qn]
(;B[qo]LB[qp:A]C[R: I suggest A.];W[pn]

;W[jq];B[kr];W[jr];B[gq];W[fq]C[That surprised me. I thought he'd try to run.

R: He can still run later...];B[fp]C[I want to give away part of the corner and make a solid wall

R: OK.];W[eq];B[dq]C[Threw away my plan :(

R: Indecision cost you at least one move...
If you have a plan, stick to it.];W[ep]
(;B[fo]C[R: Here you let white easily devide the black stones.]
;W[eo];B[en];W[do];B[co];W[dn];B[em];W[cn];B[bo]C[Till now white has to make two eyes. Black wants to prevent this.

R: Don't worry about white getting two eyes, but secure the survival of your own stones.]
;W[dr];B[cr];W[cl]C[Two eyes are possible. Don't let white to make big territory with the next move.

R: Again, try to secure your own position first. None of you groups in the lower left are secure.]
;B[ci];W[dl];B[ek]C[Black thought: White should not run to much into area, which should become black.

R: But white did just that in the lower left ;-)
Don't leave a hole just before an opponents stone. The chance that he will thrust is very big. Then you have to deal with the resulting cutting points.]

;W[fn];B[gm];W[dm]LB[gn:A]C[sacifie two stones for a "solid" wall

R: The two stones were already dead. And white would have had other possibilities, like A.]

;W[rk];B[lc]LB[jc:B][jd:A]C[R: Why not A or B?];W[qj];B[ri]
;W[pi];B[ph];W[oi];B[nh]C[R: Again, it is not a good idea to jump like that and give white an opening.]
;W[oh];B[og];W[qh];B[qg];W[rh]C[Black was surprised! Why not Q13 to run into blacks area?

R: Depending on blacks next move, black still can go Q13 or capture the marked stones. The upper right corner is still open for invasion, so no need to hurry.]

;W[ei]C[Surprised];B[eh];W[fi];B[gk];W[gj];B[fk];W[fh]C[Black thought, that becomes dangerous now.

R: No reason to worry. Just keep white small and build territory while doing so.]
;B[gi]C[R: This way you give white a target.];W[gh];B[hi]CR[eg]
C[R: Don't run. It's just one point and no secure eye. Secure your territory.]
