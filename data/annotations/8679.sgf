C[Kelenken:

Hello.
First of all, before I ask questions I want to thank you for Reviewing this game!


hi , my name is Mythical 1k on kgs and i will be your reviewer tonight  :)


overall you are not bad player , but you do lack some basics ideas.
i will try to help you understand where you went wrong and will  try to help you with how you must think.


1.  "better opening"  - at the begining of the game you went and invaded black teritory right away.
you must play bigger and easier moves !
figthing for small amount of points right away is not the right idea in the begining of the game for you.
why not  spread your stones on the board first?build nice positions of your own , you can always invade later in the game  (if oponents starts to get too much teritory)

2. "faster settling/more efficient game in the opening" - in the begining of the game you invaded black's teritory 2 times.
the first invasion was somewhat good one you did settled your group quite fast with almost no problems.
but in the 2nd invasion you played some slow moves
its one thing to understand is that you need to settle your group in fast and good (healthy way)


3. "connect/disconnect" +"weak/strong"- its one of the basics of the game.
connect to get stronger or disconect to keep oponent weak.
many times in the game you could play moves that dont let oponent conect - meaning you could have kept him weak and lifeless.
the idea is if oponent runs and tries to keep his groups alive he doesnt have time to get points , on the other hand while you chase him or sorround him you will make points(or  some other profit like big walls that you can use to make teritory or attack)

also you had chance to conect your 2 weak groups yourself - sure it wasnt a "must move" but it would have halped you a lot.

4. "reading"  - in my opinion reading was your biggest weakness in the game.

A. when you tried to kill black group on top you tried to cut the black group from her stone , but you did it without trying to read it out.
next time try to have some patience , try to think "if i cut here what would happen next" that wasnt really hard read and im not expecting you would read it all out, butreading 2-4 next moves would have helped you a lot !!

think about it this way - even if you dont cut and kill black's group.
it is still weak and not alive.
you can even play away if needed , make teritory in other place and let oponent worry about making his group alive.


B. when black made top group live , you tried to make your 2 stones live there aswell.
but you didnt see that even if you would live , you would lose your corner because of it.
perhaps it was better to defend corner instead?

C.your top group died , why?
because you left it alone while it wasnt still alive.
before you try to play away , try to read out and see if oponent can kill your group if he plays there next!

D. the B15 move and the attack on blacks left group (also rule number 3 connect/disconect)
the B15 move was very important !
it would have allowed you to disconect black's corner from the left side group , it would have been sente - black had to defend corner to live there, which would also give you the next move to attack black's left group.

E. when black cut you at E13 move , you atari him from the other side.
if you had read both ataris you could have seen that other way works much better for you.

F. the ko! when you play ko and especially as important as the ko in your game.
you have to try and see what are your biggest threats, can you afford to lose the ko,where can you give up a little bit to win the ko (the ko in your game was very important - because if you lost it its game over)



in conclusion, you need to play more "building oriented opening" instead of trying to invade everything right away.
when you try to settle your group , try making it efficient - no slow moves !
keep your groups conected and try disconect oponent groups.
and try to read, perhaps play slower games and try to see whats your next move, how will oponent  play next , and of cource before trying to cut blindly try and see will it work , or whats going to happen next.

also one small advice , try to watch some stronger players play - couldnt harm you  :)]
;B[dp]C[This was the first game I played as 8k on KGS.
With the Account before this one I was 10k so I was something surprised that I was able to become 8k so fast with this one.]
;W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[ci]
(;W[cn]TR[co][cm][cl][ck][cj]SQ[ch][cg][cf][ce][cd]C[[M\]: lets start from the begining here.

basicly if you want to live in black sphere of inluence/in blacks teritory the best place to play is where you have the most room/space to live.

if you count the number of triangle vs number of squares you can see that you have more room to live where you played , so if you want to live in blacks teritory your move was good.]
(;B[dl]C[Would it be better to play something like the variation?

no !  check the variations i added.]

(;W[ce];B[cf]
(;W[de]C[[M\]: white has many options here.

your move looks very slow , you have to play faster and more efficient moves.]

(;B[db];W[gc];B[dd]
(;W[fd]CR[eb][db][dc][dd]C[[M\]: sometimes move like this is good !

but in this situation you should think about few more things.

1.you still have a cut in e 15 you would want to fix now.
2.you should think about hurting/killing black corner
3.if you can kill corner you should still be able to get some good result.
4.look again at  number 1 (fix the cut)

with the cut at e 15 you might not be able to kill the black corner so you must think how to fix it in sente or how to get good result by fixing your weakness.]
;B[bd];W[ef]
(;B[jc]C[[M\]: very bad move by black close to white's strenght so white will have good attack against him.

the proverb says , "play away from strenght"];W[lc]C[[M\]:good !]
;B[je];W[le];B[ge];W[hd]C[[M\]: good !

black's move at g15 was not reasonble , his group is weak and not yet alive.
your group is strong and almost 100% alive - its not reasonble idea from him to try and attack you.]

(;W[kf]C[[M\]: this is kyu move no doubt about it.

(;W[gn];B[fm];W[fn];B[cm];W[hl];B[gk]C[[M\]: one thing to think about here.
in the game you let black conect and have 1 big weak group.
he has to try and save only this 1 weak group.
if he saves this one weak group then he will have no problems.

but , what if you split his groups to 2 weak groups?]
(;W[hk];B[gj];W[ii]TR[eg][ei]C[[M\]: before making attack such as this you have to be 100 sure you can do it.
you have some weaknesses in the other group so black might exploit it somehow.]

[M\]: in this situation its probably not good and i will try to explain.

you have entered to a place where black has more stones (blacks sphere of influence)  so he will have an advantage here.
there isnt much space for white to live and with next move black can attack your stone so he will have 3 to 1 stones advantage in the begining.
basicly he cant have bad result here.
sure white can survive but black will get to secure some teritory while attacking you.]

already you can see that from this exchange white didnt get any points.
he is not alive yet (black can still hurt/kill white group).
black made profit  in the corner.
and ! he can still attack you and make more profit.];B[ei];W[eg]
;B[dn]C[[M\]: black can make something like this (profit) and ! white is still not 100% alive .
