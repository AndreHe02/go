C[Hello.
I played black in this game and I have lost by 1.5 pts.
Could you please give me advises on:
1/ What were the turning points in the game?
2/ What were the main strategical mistakes?
3/ What are the concepts I should focus on to improve?

Danip (the reviewer) says:
First of all: In The Go Teaching Ladder says that you should put a game to review in which you have enough time to think. 10 min sudden death is by all means the opposite to that. If you want to improve in go you should make games of at least 20 min of main time and bio-yomi of 30 secs per move. If you think your moves and do each one knowing what you are doing then you will improve a lot. In spite of this I will review the game but don't forget it

See my comments in the game logs.

Thank you very very much for reviewing my game.



hemipilia: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.];B[pd];W[dp]

[ce:A][de:B][qf:I][cj:J][pj:E][cn:F][lq:G]C[What is the best direction of play here?

Danip: Some of the different possibilities are these ones in my opinion:

A and B are my favorite ones because you dont allow him to do the shimari and you are not overconcentrated

C,  D and H are ok as well but maybe to passive

I and E seems a little bit overconcentrated

with F and J you let him do the shimari and he will be stronger than you

G is ok but too small right now]
(;B[ce]C[This one is ok];W[cg];B[ed];W[ec];B[fd]
(;W[cd]
(;B[de];W[bd];B[hc]C[Should I have played B15 instead?
I think white is connecting C13 to B16 to easily but B15 seems to be slow to me.

Danip: The good option was doing b15 before as I showed you in other variations]
;W[be]
(;B[qj]C[Was M3 better than R10?];W[nq];B[cl]C[Red eye syndrom?

Is not about red eye syndrom here. is about good moves. If something is risky then don't do it. If something is good and not risky then do it

Shall I gently play O16, O17, N17 or Q18 instead?
Is D12 or E13 playable too?

I would play C6 as I showed in the variation before];W[cn];B[ci]
;W[eg];B[ei];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[How to choose between M17 and Q14?
It depends on the situation. If you want to emphasize top left part do this one. If you prefer right part do the other one.

I think the good point with M17 is that it is stabelizing group F16, isn't it?

In this case probably is the best option but I'm not sure];W[qf]
;B[nd];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe]

Normally when he has the shimari its better to enter in D2. And now is the moment to do it yes]

Yes it would be better];W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[lk];W[ll]C[General guidelines for the yose?

I have the feeling I played the endgame better than white but it was not sufficient to catch up.

Is it correct?

Thank you very much for reviewing my game.
