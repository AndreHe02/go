C[Hi,
my name is Jakob and i play black in this very close match. I end up winning by a mere 0.5 points.
My primary questions are how i should have handled the white invasions W34 and W92. I feel that both were overplay, but i wasnt able to punish that.
Any other comments on the game is, of course, highly appreciated too.

Thx in advance, Jakob];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[dd];B[pp];W[qq];B[qp]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[sp]C[syb: This move is a mistake.]
(;B[so]C[syb: This is a bad move. I'll say this once in general for there are more similar situations to come: White did make a bad move (too small or a mistake) and you are simply following his ideas. Playing on the first line during the opening is almost always a mistake (too small). In this special case it's a perfect opportunity to completely confine white to the corner. He will get only a few points and you will get a strong outward position (see variations). If white isn't catious it's even possible that his corner group will die. I will use the tenuki-would-have-been-a-good-idea-smiley :T whenever I think you follow the moves of your opponent whithout enough consideration from now on (and only comment on the move in some cases).]

(;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[ps];B[os]C[syb: :T (not too bad because he has to answer... but why not leave this move for ko-threats or view the development of the rest of the game first... you can play here any time).]
;W[rs]
(;B[jj]C[syb: I don't like this move... it looks kind of greedy. Maybe you played it as a ladder breaker... but I think it's to loose... simply strengthen your corner directly (by playing P5 for example) and your position will be fine.]

;W[mq];B[ic];W[np];B[pi]C[syb: Looks very good... white did play some small moves, you did occupy some important spots... (but why did you play J3? :) )]
;W[pj];B[qi]C[syb: A solid move... white should try to make a light shape now...]

;W[rk];B[ni];W[mk]
(;B[qg]C[syb: This is too lame... :) Although you might not be able to kill white anymore you should still profit from attacking him (or simply play elsewhere).]

(;B[gp]C[syb: White F4 is uncommon... maybe you should try a different response (see variation).]
