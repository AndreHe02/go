AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hi !

This was a very slow game with a much better player. Unfortunately, my victory was sealed by a move we both missed until late yose...
Anyway, this is a game where I played very seriously, so I guess my mistakes here must root pretty deep in my way of play.

I am a French native-speaker, but English or German would do it as well : please choose your favourite one :o) .

Best regards,
mianreg

Jay: Glad to help. Usually, a game without handi is the best way to study. But here, we could point out how one can best answer certain situation.]
PL[W];W[qf];B[nd];W[pj]C[By the way, in handicap games, this Kobayashi-like jump is my favourite one with W... because I'm not sure how to answer... If you know a common reaction that would best fit, please let me know ! :o)

Jay: This move is unsual when there is an opposite stone at Q4. But, this is handi game, so W has to be aggressive.]
;B[qm];W[fc];B[jc];W[df];B[fd];W[gd];B[fe];W[ec]C[Jay: Again, this is somewhat aggressive. Normally, W go C17.]

C[I started this sequence to force W make a dumpling... The point is, it is a very bad call, for he connects the whole thing...

Jay: The sequence is not working for B.];W[eg];B[eh];W[gg];B[ee]
;W[fg];B[hg];W[fi];B[ih]C[Jay: Insisting on fighting only makes B heavy here to be attacked. Not a good choice.]
;W[jg];B[gi];W[ei];B[gk];W[jh];B[ii];W[cn];B[kj]C[Widening my central group and pressuring W's weak one, I like it better than just answering the kakari.

Jay: This is a key move, not because W is weak but B is. W's previous move was a big point. But, L10 is vital for both.]
;W[mh];B[fp];W[bp];B[co];W[bo];B[dn];W[cq];B[cm]C[Jay: This last sequence is a bit strange for B. It is going wrong direction. C8 area has limited potential for both sides.]
;W[hp];B[jq]C[Not sure of this one, but I guess it's an annoying one. B6 is clean but I thought it was still irrelevant.

Jay: This is a good move. Bottom is important.];W[io];B[mq]

(;B[kq]C[Jay: This move is too cautious.];W[lp]C[K4 very ajikeshi, right ?..

Jay: K4 is good, it creats cutting and weakens W. The next B move is questionable.]
;B[kn];W[mo]
(;B[lq]C[Jay: This move is solid but slow. Though it is playable in handi games, this gives W a chance to develop into center.]
;W[lm];B[jl];W[il];B[jj]C[I considered Q3 as well, but to me, the sequence with K10 seems enormous at this point, and of course much more active.

Jay: This is good move. W has to be concerned with the top group.]

C[Jay: This is intolerable for B, to allowe W to settle in sente at the LR corner. The handi advantage is slowly eroding.]
;B[rd]C[my upper side is still pretty loose with this move... It seems clean, but as I thought, the invasion was a success, and I would be very grateful to get advice about the next few moves...

Jay: The upper side is still somewhat open. A move like R16 is better if you want to upper side.]

Jay: Yes. It helps W to settle all over the board, while W has already solidified the three corners. No more weak groups. W is winning at this point.]

Thanks for reviewing !
Hoperfully, see you on KGS :o)

Jay: This game is subtle. To summarize, you have some direction problems early on, but had chances toward the end. But it slipped away, eventually your oppoenent let you win. Merci.]
