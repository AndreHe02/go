C[Dear Reviewer,
 This game was an unrated, 20 minute per side game on Yahoo. I was playing white, and gck2000 was playing black. Although it was played on Yahoo and I understand the hundreds of problems people have on Yahoo, I played this game as seriously as I could.  Could you please go over my thought process and attack? I've been having a really tough time lately on balancing territory and influence, so I've been trying out different things in the hope of identifying some problems.
Thank you very much.

P.S. I'm not really sure exactly how strong I am, but people I have played say that I'm around 10 kyu strength.

Hello, im going to mark my moves with a S: to distinquish them from you comments
hope thius helps.];B[pp];W[dp];B[dd];W[pd]C[S: this is a fighting opening so you should expect a lot of it in this game]
;B[fq];W[cn]C[I decided to use this joseki pattern to back an attack against the d-16 black stone and defend the left side.]
;B[dr]C[S: it seems too early for your opponent to play on the senconmd line and while it looks sente i think a kakari at d14 or f16 would be a much larger move than just defending at c3.]
;W[cq];B[jp];W[cf];B[dh]C[I wasn't quite sure how to respond to this move...

S:the one point jump is never bad.  e14 see var.]
(;W[cj]C[I was thinking here that if he came down at B or C, I could push towards the corner stone and either disrupt his corner and upper territory, or try cutting it off and gain influence.

S: ah but he didnt come down at c12.  Its always risk to assume the next move of you opponent, (makes it very easy to throw a wretch in you plans as he did with c14)]

(;B[ce];W[fc]C[S: your creating too many weak groups here.  plus you'll have to worry about the invasion at c8 later
better to just extend out with d14 (3-3 is still open if you do that)]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[jc];W[ef]C[S: good, keep black divided];B[nc]
;W[qf];B[pb];W[qj]C[At this point I was more concerned with the right side than the corner since I saw that black had one extra move if I continued the joseki at r17 to protect the corner. Was it ok to play at r10?

S: it seem a liitle close , black has a nice checking at r7 or r8
i migh play r7 or even r6 here, but your idea is good (defending at r17 like you did in the bottom left is much too slow)]
;B[qc];W[rd];B[qd];W[qe]C[S: see you really havent lost that much, and you can really see how close r10 is.]
;B[qm]C[S:and theres the check, this is much too good a  move for black]
;W[cc]C[I was attempting here either to disrupt his corner altogether or force a weak shape for use later.]
;B[cd]
(;W[db]C[S: this is an overplay
better to play e18]
(;B[bc]C[S: a gift move letting you connect];W[eb];B[bf];W[cg]
;B[bg];W[ch];B[cb];W[dc];B[bb];W[ed]C[Right after I took, I thought it was a waste of time to take the stone, so I believe it was a mistake on my part.

S: while it does guarrantee life i agree, it is much too slow
 the bottom center is starting to look pretty big];B[ne];W[of]
LB[je:C][mp:A][hq:B]C[S: very slow there are too many bigger moves on the board like a, b , ands c]
;B[jf]C[S: which he took. p14 was likea  free move for him (remember q16 is only one stone, you dont have to save it)]
;W[nq]C[Here, I was attempting to invade the unsettled moyo before it became territory. Was it a mistake to an invasion at this point?

S: no invasion is good , but id prefer something a little closer to the center, maybe n4 or even n3)  m3 would be very good for black here]
;B[oq];W[np];B[lq]C[S: no base for white];W[mo]C[S: very slow and heavy, gives little eye shape and does nothing to black. you should jump ouy to o6 oreven o7 if you want to play lightly]
;B[ol];W[mm];B[jm];W[mk];B[ml];W[ll];B[nl];W[kn];B[lk]C[S: watch out for cuts like this, you opponent misses a goldne oppurtuniy]

(;W[kk]C[S; he should not save this stone]
(;B[lj]C[S: so this was a gift to you];W[km];B[jl];W[kl];B[jn]
;W[jk];B[hh];W[ik];B[fk];W[hm];B[io]
(;W[hl]C[S:very slow way ot protect the cut maybe h10 instead]
;B[nj];W[oi];B[qq];W[fm];B[dj];W[ck];B[nf];W[og];B[rc];W[re]
;B[gb];W[or];B[pr];W[op];B[pq];W[on];B[pn];W[om];B[cr]
(;W[bq]C[Probably a mistake. I was thinking b2 would be better and accomplish the same goal.

S; true but id be thinking of reducing his top frame work
 b3 is a large endgame move, we're not quite there yet

a move like n12 or j16 might do well

you also have the peep at e11 (followed by the shoulder hit at g11 could be fun]
;B[od];W[oe];B[pc]C[Around here, I decided to take a quick look at the board and read that I was losing.

S: i agree, if i count right (which is  a weak are for me so it may not be) i think blacks ahead by around 30)]
;W[mi];B[mj]
(;W[nh]C[S: slow defense how about n13];B[kh];W[lg];B[nr];W[mr]
;B[os];W[mq];B[lr]
(;W[mg]C[S: slow, you should come up with creative moves that dont just defend the cut but threaten as well. how about]
;B[ms];W[lp]C[S: still slow];B[eo]
(;W[do]C[S: too passive e5 is an overplay, punish it];B[ep]
;W[en]C[S; slow];B[hn];W[gn];B[go];W[le]C[S:  good, reduce his framework this move is huge]
;B[ld];W[ke];B[je];W[kd];B[jd];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[md]
;B[gc]C[S: o16 is much bigger than g16
be careful you dont fall into the trap of playing in an area just because your opponent does, you seem to be doing that a lot this game]

;W[qn];B[rn];W[oo];B[rp];W[hf];B[aj]C[At this point, the opponent had less than a minute left, and I thought that the invasion was played a bit too far.

S: it is an overplay because of the aji with b14];W[ah];B[bh]
;W[bi];B[ai];W[ak];B[ag];W[bj]C[S: he shouls just give up the two stones and cut his losses]
;B[ah];W[be]C[Black resigned shortly afterwards.

S: and rightly so, the entire left corner is dead 
heavy price to pay trying to save a measly two stones

Ok, my two big peices of advice is
    1.  Before responding to your opponents move, think to yourself is there a bigger move out there?  just because your opponent plays somewhere doesn't mean you should to.

2.  try moves that accomplish more than one thing. if you must defend a cut, defend it while threatning his moyo.  let your stones do more for you (you should find as you get better at this you be better at blancing territory and influence)

my little advice is standard stuff i tell everone
play as much as you can, but take you time.  Theres no substiture for experience but if you play hastily, youll just practice your mistakes

aslo work on your life and death problems, you missed an oppurtunity to cut and kill a large group of his (just as he missed  a simialr opputunity on you.

well thats the review, hoped it helps and i appologize for teh delay (my daughter has been sick recently, i havennt been able to play neerly as much as  i like
