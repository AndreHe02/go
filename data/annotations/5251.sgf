C[Hi Edgardo,

I have tried to comment your game the best as I can and hope you will forgive my english faults (as I am french)]
;B[pd]LB[cp:a][pp:b][dd:c][dq:d]C[It seems to me that you enable your opponent to develop his game too quickly and on a too large scale due to the first opening moves you have chosen.

Let's see the first 4 opening moves : in response to Black 1, you played 2 at A, then Black played 3 at B and you finished by playing 4 at C.

It seems to me that your 3/4 point at A wasn't in the good direction and that you should have played it facing your 4/4 point at D.

It is important to play your 3/4 point facing your 4/4 point as they work well together and that it allows you to reduce the effectiveness of a black nirensei or sanrensei (see variation after)

Of course, you couldn't know by advance were Black will play, but you could have done this by playing the 4/4 point first and then the 3/4 point, which enable you to choose the good direction and to prevent a Black move facing your 3/4 point (as in the game).]

(;W[cp]C[Now, we can return to your game !];B[pp];W[dd]
(;B[eq]TR[pp][pd]LB[ep:a]C[White 3/4 point not facing the 4/4 point, allows Black 5, an aprroach which prevent the formation of a white shimari there and which is also a very large extension move from black's nirensei

Black's direction of play is good, but I would prefer the high approch at A to prevent a white pincer and to settle easily the black group (see variation before)

As Black uses the low approach, you should not have hesitate to pincer it to reduce the effectiveness of the black nirensei (see variation after)]

(;W[dm];B[eo];W[do];B[ip]C[You can compare this result to the result of the former variation and notice that in the game Black develops himself too quickly and on a too large scale]

(;W[qf]LB[qj:a]C[(I think maybe I shouldn't have attacked here. Was it better to play on the left?)

It seems to me that you could play on the left with the plan to build your own moyo shape but have to keep in mind that Black could refuse that deal and pincer your approach (see variation A before).

So, I think you played in the good direction but I would prefer the loose invasion at A to prevent a Black sanrensei and to enable White to settle his group easily (see variation B before)]
;B[qh]TR[pp]C[Good black pincer which works also as a very wide extension from the opposite 4/4 point]
;W[qc]C[Good invasion of the corner as it is the standard response to such a pincer...]
;B[qd]TR[qh]C[... now Black cuts in the good direction to have his stones working with the marked one to make territory....]
;W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]LB[qf:a][qh:b]C[(Up to here I was following Joseki.
Were the next few moves ok?)

...and it appears at the end of this sequence that by approaching at A you allowed Black to pincer at B, which pincer engaged you to invade the corner and play this joseki (without any errors) which enables Black to reinforce his moyo shape and keep sente to play a big move

That's the reason why I keep on prefering the immediate loose invasion at R10 (you can compare this result with the former variation one)]
;B[oc]C[Now Black is using his sente to enlarge his moyo shape with the following forced sequence...]
;W[ob];B[nd];W[mc];B[md];W[rf]TR[md][qe][od][qd][oc][re][nd]
[pd]LB[qn:a][nq:b][qq:c][gc:d][cg:e]C[(Should I have left R14 and played somewhere else?)

It seems to me that this is not the moment for a local fight here as you have the sente and that there are several big points waiting to be played on the goban .

You could consider to play at A, B, or C to reduce black's moyo (it seems urgent to do this but now Black has a strong marked group to deal with your invasion) or even D and E to reinforce your own moyo]
;B[se];W[og]
(;B[pf]C[It seems to me that this is not urgent to play here for Black and that it is too close from his strong group to make a good use of it (see variation before)]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[of];B[pe];W[pi];B[qi];W[qj];B[rg]
(;W[pj]C[You should have played 38 at P10 to protect the cut at P11 as the shisho is good for Black (see variation before)]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni];B[oj];W[mh];B[ok]C[Now you have to groups to protect at the same time]

;W[np];B[lp];W[oq];B[pq];W[or];B[pr];W[mq]C[(I think I'm letting black gain too much power in the lower middle. What could I have done?)

Because of the cut at P11, you are now under a severe attack and just have to try to live, if possible]
;B[nn]TR[np][mm][om]C[The "dog nose" is not frequently considered as a good shape]
;W[on];B[no];W[oo]

;W[op];B[nm];W[lq];B[kq];W[kr];B[jq];W[jr];B[ir];W[ls];B[cr]
;W[lc]TR[oh][og][of][ni][mh][pg]C[(Was it ok to ignore the last move?)

It seems to me that it is ok as it would be yose to respond to it but you should have remenbered that you have a floating group to save and avoid to push Black in his direction]
;B[le];W[kd];B[ke];W[kh];B[dh]TR[oh][og][of][kh][ni][mh][pg]
LB[ce:a][ck:b]C[Black 83 is a good idea as it is important to attack from away, but I would prefer to play at C12 to live more easily with one of the natural extensions at A or B]
;W[je]LB[ri:a]C[(With this move I think I'm attacking black and claming the upper part of the board.
The upper left is very open, was deffending it better?
What about my group on P12?)

"Attack is the best defense" (did you noticed at this moment that Black can live in gote at A?) but you have to remember that it is dangerous to push Black in the direction of your floating group even if it permits you to make territory in the upper part of the board

Even if the upper left corner is very open, you have now to take care of your floating group if you don't want to loose it]
;B[jf];W[jd];B[lg];W[lh]C[This and the next moves are to save this group.]
;B[jj];W[ih];B[fm]TR[lh][oh][og][of][kh][ni][mh][pg][ih]C[Black 89 and 91 moves are a good way to deal with a runing fight as they allow Black to build territory and make points immediatly without beting everything on the death of the white group which regularly doesn't happens]
;W[if];B[jg];W[jh];B[ig];W[hh];B[hg];W[dj];B[fg];W[fi]C[(Whith this move I think they are connected but blacks lower middle looks big)

It seems to me that they are not really connected (see variations after)]

(;B[he];W[hd];B[ge];W[gd];B[cc]C[(When should I have defended this?)

I would like you to notice that during the whole game you tried to reduce the large moyo shape that your opponent has been able to build during the opening, without having the posibilitie to build your own and take advantage of a possible invasion at the 3/3 point, as he did in the opposite corner]

(;W[cd]C[(Is this te correct move? D17 better?)

It seems to me that this is the wrong direction as you should play at D17 to build territory instead of inviting Black to invade it (see variation before)]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[bd]
(;W[cf]C[(This move ok? It lets black play B14 and take a big part of the side.
I didn'y play B14 because I don't see what to do against C15.
Where should I have played?)

It seems to me that the natural answer is at B15 (see possible variation before)]
