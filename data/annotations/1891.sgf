C[RLJ: My last move in the record is very bad, but I felt behind before that, and yet I can't really see which were my bad moves. Somehow my direction of play was just a bit wrong throughout... so any ideas about better strategy very welcome. (for the record I am white).

Arend:  I think you had a few a little inefficient moves in upper left (d13, f14, h15) and upper right
(p17, q17). But I think your biggest mistake was that you didn't pay enough attention to the weakness black left behind in the unfinished tsuke-nobi joseki in lower left. If you are aware of this weakness, then you don't play a move like C11, which allows Black  to get thick, make territory and indirectly defend that weakness all at a time.
Good luck for further improvement!];B[dp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd]
;B[di];W[jd];B[pj]MA[ql][qm][qn][qh][qg][qf]C[Arend: It is a little more common to play this on the 3rd line.  The advantage of the low move is that you can more easily get a base if white approaches this stone at any of the square-marked points.
The advantage of the high move, however, is that you can ignore these moves if you like -- it is not so easy to attack a stone on the 4th line.
So really -- play what you like!];W[fq];B[fp]LB[dn:A]C[Just A (D6) might be better here. The disadvantage of the tsuke-nobi is that you either end in gote (in which case black is a little overconcentrated), or you leave a cut behind.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dq];W[jq];B[qn]C[Arend: Now white can always aim at the cut at E4 -- not by playing there, but by starting at C6 or D7.]
;W[np];B[qf];W[de]C[RLJ: maybe this is a bit agressive, but I feel the need to get the initiative somehow
Arend: Very good. If you are prepared to cope with a double kakari in upper right, then this move is just fine.]
;B[ce];W[cf];B[cd]
(;W[dg]LB[gf:A]C[Arend: An interesting alternative is 'A' (G14) here. This way you don't get heavy. See the variations for why you need not be afraid of a cut.]
;B[fc]
(;W[nc]LB[gf:A][ck:B]C[RLJ: not sure about the exchange in the top right. I am solid and don't feel heavy yet, but B has taken territory
Arend: I assume you mean top left. Well, the problem is that your group there needs another move, and I think you should play there (I suggest A (G14)) now. The problem is not that you group could die -- it is far too strong for that to happen, but that black will get a huge framework in the lowerleft while attacking.
Also, if you have played A, you can aim at invading at B.];B[fi]
C[Arend: Very good. This is better than trying to attack the D15 stones directly.]
;W[ci]LB[gf:A]C[Arend: This is the first bad move in the game. I would still play at A.
The problem is white is making black very strong with this exchange.]
;B[cj];W[ch];B[dj]C[Arend: Again very good. Now most of the aji with the E4 cut is gone.]
;W[ff]C[RLJ: the B territory is very big, and I seem to have ended in gote. Presumably I should be able to do better.
Arend: Jumping one step further (still G14 :-) ) is a little better.]
;B[rp];W[qh]LB[qq:A]C[RLJ: too aggressive again? If B solidifies this side as well then I am surely behind on territory so I feel the need to do _something_

Arend: You are right that you are a little behind. As a general advice: Don't get impatient too early -- unless you have lost a big group in a non-joseki, hardly any game between players below 5D is decided at move 32! Your opponent always gives you numerous chances to catch up - he isn't a professional either...
As for R12: I don't consider this a fighting move very much. The follow-ups are pretty fixed, and result in an exchange of white taking away territory vs black gaining influence. So it is a big move, but not an aggressive move.
It is certainly an option, but A (R3) is possible, too.];B[of]
LB[ph:A]C[Arend: Black should pretty much always attach at A in this position.]
;W[oh];B[qc]MA[of][oh]C[Arend: If Black wants to play there, she should rather play there immediately (without the marked exchange).]
;W[qd];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[rf]C[Arend: I am not sure whether this is better than the usual move at R15.]
;B[ob]
(;W[oc]LB[nb:A]C[Arend: This move has to be at A. See the variation.]
;B[nb]C[RLJ: I'm trying to defend my cut in sente so I can play at the bottom... but the shape is bad for me]
;W[pc]C[RLJ : this is wrong and not necessary.
Arend: Yes!];B[pb];W[qq];B[on]LB[qi:A][rh:B][ri:C][ph:D]C[Arend: Black is building up territory which is open at the bottom, which is bad. Maybe better to play the B A -W B exchange first. (Or maybe even B A - W B - B C -- after which black has very good cutting aji at D.]
;W[mh]C[RLJ: somehow I feel short-changed again
Arend: The reason for this is mostly W42 at P17.];B[mc];W[md]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[mb];W[me];B[jg]LB[kc:A]C[Arend: Interesting move. But maybe black should simply take territory with A.]
;W[kc]C[Arend: Good.];B[gg];W[gf];B[hg];W[bj];B[bk];W[ai];B[cl]
C[Arend: Good.];W[go]C[Arend: Good.];B[fn]
(;W[mn]C[RLJ: actually I think h7 is better for me
Arend: I agree. Another thing worth trying is to see what black replies to white E4.
(See variations.)];B[ri]C[RLJ: I hadn't played here because I thought that it was gote for both... but actually I have to answer, so I need to play in this area sooner (when?)]
;W[qi];B[qj];W[rh];B[hm]C[RLJ: now I am behind I think];W[pm]
;B[qm]LB[pn:A]C[Arend: Black should reply at A.];W[jj]LB[ep:A]
C[Arend: W A (E4 )is still worth trying.];B[jm];W[jo];B[mg]
C[RLJ: bad aji comes back to haunt me];W[ng];B[lh];W[mi];B[le]
;W[he]LB[gd:A][lf:B]C[Arend: A (G16) is better shape.
Again, you play a little too slowly while connection your group to the outside -- try make as efficient shape as possible while moving out, try to make territory on the way!
Also, you can play B (M14) first.];B[mf];W[nf];B[li];W[lj];B[mj]
;W[lk];B[nj];W[oi];B[oj]
(;W[hc]LB[lm:A]C[RLJ: this is just plain wrong. I thought that the cut here worked for B, and that I could probably deal with the cut in the centre without giving up too much. In fact this cut never worked for B, and B's next play is enough to win the game by 15 points after komi.
Arend: Yes, you could either connect your center stones wtih the lower side with s.th. like A (m7), or even better play as in the variaion first.]
;B[lm]C[RLJ : its all over now... I did play the endgame but not a lot of interest happened...

Arend: Yes, now black is leading more clearly. I add a few moves to show how white should probably start the endgame.]

;B[er];W[fr];B[dr];W[ij];B[rq];W[rr]C[Arend: I count about 72 points for black and a little less than 65 points for white. As it is black's move, she is still leading, but white still has a chance.]

(;W[nb];B[oc];W[od]C[Arend: Because black is not alive in the corner yet, the cut is not dangerous for white.]

(;B[nd];W[qg];B[mc]C[Arend: This would be like black playing a ladder that doesn't work. Black has to come back to make live in the corner, and the more stones she had added on the outside before, the worse it will be.]
