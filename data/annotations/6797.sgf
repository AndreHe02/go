C[Black: Thomasben [14k\]

White: Joib[14 k\]

White has a better tactic sense than black, but black adopts a better strategy with more tenukis and sente moves that enable him to snatch the victory on a last attack.

refer to the variations for humble attempts of alternative strategies

interesting review to make, thanks
