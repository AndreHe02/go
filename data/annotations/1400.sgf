C[To reviewer:
Hi, thanks very much for reviewing this game for me.  I played black here.  I can't really think of specific questions, just general remarks regarding my building of the moyo from the double wing in the upper left, and attempted reduction of the opponent's corresponding moyo in the lower left.  Of course, any additional comments will be greatly appreciated!

My rank on IGS is much lower than on KGS -- around 7k.

seriously. ;-) )];B[pd]C[Comments for the GTL in Feb 2001 by Erik Ekholm, 3 dan, Sweden.]

(;B[no]C[EE: Up to here, Black's play has displayed a good sense of direction, but O5 is a bit unorthodox.  (Var)]

(;B[kr]C[EE: :-) This must be due to a confusion with the two space high pincer variation.]

(;B[ch]C[EE: Too obedient? (Var)];W[eq]C[EE: This move is a bit too good to allow.]
;B[md]LB[ie:a]C[EE: Doubtful direction. Better enlarge the moyo in top left with 'a' (j15).]

(;B[hg]C[EE: Not bad, but this gives White a chance to back off from the risk.]
;W[hc];B[gc];W[hb];B[gf]C[EE: A ponnuki, but a bit overconcentrated with respect to the wall on the left, and White took profit at the edge.]
