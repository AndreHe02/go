Depending on how it is used and how the game progresses you could make some territory on the left utilizing that stone ot as away for groups to run and connect]

I feel like I've been playing poorly lately but I can't pinpoint why.
Basic stratagy advice in addition to some tactical tesuji adive would be most welcome.
Thank you for your time. 

Mostly its just small things like direction of play in this game and needing to look at the board for the small movies that let the big moves work other than that basic life and death problems will help a lot with reading out and seeing the small moves and direction of play comes with playing games and reviewing them feel free to contact me at litteral_taylor@yahoo.com if you have any more questions]
