C[JRH: Hi! I'll be commenting your game. I'll be annotating game like this.  Currently my AGA rating is 2.5D.  I expect that would translate to about 1k/1d IGS, although I don't know the current conversion rate.

High level comments: Nice self analysis! You definitely thought of some good ways to improve your game. I hope you find my comments helpful.]

(;B[om];W[no];B[qj]LB[qc:B][nq:A]C[JRH: If I were white, I would be happy to take the huge move at A.  Your corner is still open at B, so you can call it territory yet.]
;W[pl];B[qk];W[pk]
(;B[qn];W[pm];B[qo];W[pn]TR[jj][om]C[JRH: This is too easy on White. White is very happy to take the thickness and reduce the effectiveness of the marked stones.]

(;B[pp]C[I played this move because i was scared of P3, but white playing P3 wasn't actaully that bad. The threat on r11 was actually pretty severe, I probably should have played R4 instead. At the time I was playing this game I thought r11 treat wasn't that bad, but i was wrong.

JRH: Yeah, I agree with that analysis.];W[ql];B[rl];W[rk]C[JRH: Nice moves by white here.]
;B[rm];W[qi];B[rj];W[ri];B[sk];W[ph]C[JRH: Now the opening is good for white.]
;B[qd];W[qf]LB[jc:A][dj:B][nq:C]C[Still got a pretty good result i guess, but i feel like white played wrong

JRH: White's move was slow. White can take a big point now. (A-C). I would probably choose B. A and C will be a sort of Miai.]
;B[fc];W[cf]C[JRH: Nice, this takes advantage of white's slow move.]
;B[jc];W[md]
(;B[ne]LB[oc:A]C[Is this correct??? I don't even know

JRH: It's alright as an attacking move, but it's hard to attack the stone when White is so solid on the right side.  Probably best would be to seal up the corner at A and take sente.]

(;W[me];B[mf];W[ke];B[kd]LB[lf:A]C[feels like a vital spot here

JRH: Hard to find a goot attacking move here.  I think the move at M14 (A) is more important for white.]

(;B[ld]C[JRH: Nice. Good shape-killing move.];W[le];B[mc]
(;W[ie]C[I felt like white definitely should have played O16 instead of this move and wouldve got a good result

JRH: I think White got the better deal with the ponnuki.];B[nd]
;W[jd];B[mi]
(;W[mg]C[JRH: Not a great move by white -- it's too hard to capture the stones in the conter.. White's ahead, so white should try te preserve the lead.]
;B[nh];W[lh];B[ng]C[JRH: A bit slow, I think. You can treat the center stones lightly. I would take some big points after this move.]

(;W[li];B[mj]C[JRH: Again, slow.];W[lj]C[I reckon this exchange wasn't that good, probably should have tenukied instead of playing N10

JRH: Yup!];B[ck];W[mk]C[I feel like white shouldn't have played this move, there's so much more out there

JRH: I agree. To focused on capturing. You caught up quite a bit here.]
;B[ch];W[cm];B[ej]LB[eh:A][di:C][ek:B]C[is this right??

JRH: This is a weird move. Much more common to play at A or B. This move has a weakness at C, although it can sometimes be useful to make this shape.

A would be the best because it would allow you to try to extract the F17 stone more easily.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[ei]

(;W[cd];B[dj];W[eg];B[fj]
(;W[jq];B[ic]C[probably, should've played this move a lot earlier, double sente move worth quite alot. At least i was able to play it in the end.

JRH: Not quite double sente. I wouldn't respond as black to J17.]

JRH: It's hard because white is so strong everywhere. I'm surprised it didn't go worse.]
;W[hp];B[hk]C[JRH: Weird shape here, but seems hard for White to do something about it. Thus, looks like a nice move for you =).]
