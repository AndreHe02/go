C[Hi thanks to whoever reviews this.


I am about 7-8k , i didn't play for quite a while, but hope my advice helps. my kgs is houth (7k)
look  all the moves i show you, it will help you out. 
For the most part you play too slow and defensive. In go, you must attack to win, you let white gain over all the vital points, many times this game could have turn out differently. white became too aggresive and ended up losing. But there is still a lot of potential in you, so keep studying go .]
;B[dq];W[co]C[My first question is about his opening is this a good opening it kinda through me off when i first saw it. 

I'm not too sure about this opening, but it is better to take the upper right corner first]

(;B[gq];W[cl];B[cp]C[would there have been a much better to move than here

the 4-4 , or any upper right corner move would been better]
;W[bp];B[bq]C[a must, to protect your corner];W[dp];B[cq];W[bo]
;B[ep];W[eo]
(;B[fp]C[slow]
(;W[iq]C[bad move]
(;B[hr]C[way too slow]
(;W[kq]C[now white settles , bad for black];B[qp]C[bad move, white can approach that corner easliy]

(;W[nq]C[slow , not good enough]
(;B[oq]C[In this move i played here because a guy i had played before that was stronger than me told me that this is a strong weakness on here but when i looked at the joseki there was nothing about this move.  

even the dumbest can be good , if you read properly and your opponent make mistakes. at this case its a bad move, since it makes white stronger]

(;W[or];B[pq];W[np]C[too good for white, black should have attack earlier instead of pulling back]
;B[qm];W[qk]C[again, too close, but in this case white puts pressure, so its a good move]
;B[qi]C[should i have taken the corner instead of moving here



yeah, its probabaly better if you did, but its not a bad move]
;W[ok]
(;B[qf]C[too soft and slow];W[rl];B[rm];W[pl]C[bad move, has no direction towards the game]
;B[pm]C[slow, black won't die don't worry and go to another spot]
;W[om]C[too good for white, moyo ( potential area ) is too big]
;B[on];W[nm];B[pd]C[slow, but its needed];W[pj]C[useless move]

(;B[oc]C[way too slow spread out more];W[qc];B[qd];W[rc]
(;B[pc]C[would have been better to move at Q18 instead of Q17

no it didn't really matter, because white suppose to die anyways, if q 18, see the following moves]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[pa];B[rd];W[rb]
(;B[qa]C[wrong move made an eye for white];W[ra];B[oa];W[qb]
;B[dc];W[ic]TR[oa][ob][dc][oc]C[On this move wouldnt it have been better to have moved at C15 or somewhere around there. 


yes, but of course , you can attack the white stones, due to the wall you made to attack the stone in the middle]

(;B[cg]C[slow !!];W[ci]C[bad for black, good for white];B[eg]

(;W[nd]C[intresting move but not good]
(;B[mc]C[too defensive, try to attack more in games];W[nc];B[nb]
;W[nf];B[gn]C[I moved here because the guy i was playing had a lot of influence so i knew i needed influence. would there have been a better way to get influence.

if you are talking about the bottom left, that is the best way to
get influence]
(;W[do]C[slow move];B[gl]C[good move, but maybe you want to decrease the right side influence]

yes, because there is basically nothing left for you , except to  trap the three stones at the right side]
