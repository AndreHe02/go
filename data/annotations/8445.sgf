;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[fc];W[df];B[kc]C[Is B over extended? Shouldnt this be rather at K17.

B: What black is playing is the so called "Mini Chinese opening". Maybe 30 years ago one would have called this "to far, better is K17", but nowadays it is popular.

In general I wouldnt worry to much about these types of questions and rather experiment with different moves. At your playing strength (and at mine as well) there are other areas, were one has to improve.  Deciding questions like that is something for the professionals. And even there the answer might vary over time.]
;W[od]LB[qj:A]C[B: This is the wrong direction, and just what black wants. Attacking, black will get a good position on the left and the right, and white will be weak. The usual move is at A]
;B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb];W[md]LB[mc:A]C[B: The usual white move is at A, securing a base for the group. I agree, even with A it still lookes a little bit vulnerable. But it is in fact rather secure. That is what the professionals say in the corresponding position of the chinese opening.]
;B[mb];W[ic]LB[nf:A]C[Is this overplay? W's group N16 is not settled yet but W starts another attack already.

B: It is hard to find a good move now. But you definetely have to strengthen your endangered group. Your move weakens it. I would have played at A, but it doesnt really feel good. White is already running.]
;B[ke]C[W's invasion in J17 resulted in 2 weak white group and one weak black group. B is better off.]
;W[mf];B[kg];W[mh];B[hd];W[ph]C[B: good! Now whites position is playable again.]
;B[qh];W[pi];B[qg]LB[qi:A][qj:B]C[B: Now A is very important. If Black plays B, not only does he connect his right side, but also your group is running again. Get access to the side! Split Black! Keep blacks upper right stones out of the game. Closing in a group gives you an advantage.]
;W[dc]C[B: This is an engame move. Your stones are safe, black stones are safe. Do not play endgame moves in the opening and also not during middle game fight.]
;B[eb]C[Too small for B? K4 or kakari on D4 better?

B: right. Blacks move is bad. An end game move.];W[db]LB[db:A]
[eb:B][fb:C]C[B: Do not answer blacks move! Now the exchange Black B White A brings points for black, but didnt cost a move. This is unbearable. You can only accept such a thing, when it was blacks priviledge, blacks sente. But here white B, BLack C would also have been a natural sequnce. Something like "double sente". BUt this is not double sente. You do not have to answer. So do not do it.]
;B[fq];W[hq];B[cq]
(;W[dq]LB[df:B][cp:A][dq:C][hq:D]C[B: wrong direction. Always play to the side, were the resulting position is bigger. In that case, if you play A you get a huge area  between A and B of influence on the left side. With your move the area between C and D is much smaller.]

;B[bo];W[dl];B[dm];W[em];B[fr];W[es];B[dk];W[cl];B[el];W[bl]
;B[bm];W[cj];B[fo]C[W decided to throw away D5 group and work with H3 group instead. Keeping the W "wall" and all B groups separe should be much better (as shown in alternative)

B: you cannot give away those stones. They are important cuttting stones. Cutting two black groups apart. Now is the moment to attack!

I know: There are positions were you treat similar stones lightly, you give them away and get a position slightly shifted. But note the important difference: Your stones are cutting stones! Giving them away is katastrophic.

VIP (very important position):
withou reading ahead try to estimate the power of the groups: which groups are safe? which are connected?  you should be able to feel how important your group on the E-line is for that.]
(;W[gp];B[fp];W[go];B[fm];W[ek];B[en];W[mp]C[It is obvious now that it was a bad trade for W.]
;B[pn];W[gr];B[fs];W[oq];B[pq];W[qk]C[B: good! You are seperating blacks right side!]
;B[kq]C[Overplay from B? or a real treat?

B: looks like an overplay to me.];W[kp];B[lp];W[lq];B[lo];W[ko]

C[Better on D10. Kills all aji.
B: right. That is true only because the back Atari on A would not be worth much after your D10]
;B[di];W[dj];B[dg];W[cf]C[Better on E14?
B: Your move is good! Put pressure on Black.];B[fh]LB[bh:A]
C[B: Black gets out, so you have to connect at A. After that Black wouldnt have achieved much with his attack.]
;W[ge];B[bh];W[bi];B[hh]C[B: strange: Black lets you connect again. You should play C12.]
;W[eh];B[eg];W[fg];B[ef];W[fd];B[ff];W[gg];B[gh];W[gf];B[ei]
C[B's group G12 is pretty much alive. but did W get enough compensation with F16? including the aji with J17?
B: If you conect now then it is fine. Black did not achieve much. And as you say: You have options on the upper side.]
;W[ch]C[B: good! I am relieved to see this move.];B[cg];W[bg]
;B[ee];W[ed];B[dh];W[ah];B[ng];W[of];B[qi]
(;W[nk]LB[qj:A]C[B: Ouch! Big overplay! You have to play the "usual move" A and connect  yours stones. Even then they are not really connected, but you would get compensation.]
;B[gd];W[fe];B[rk]
(;W[rj]C[B: You are in deep trouble now. No chance to save everything.]
;B[qj];W[sk];B[og];W[pg];B[pe];W[oe]LB[nf:A]C[B: wrong point. Play A to take away a liberty. That is important!]
;B[oi]C[B: good move by black. Lets you helpless. There is a slim chance ...]
(;W[pj];B[pk]C[double treat from B. dont think W's P15 can survive without Q12. On the other hand S6 group also likely to die if W doesnt capture at T8.
B: That is right. White suffers a big loss here or there.];W[oj]
;B[pl];W[rq]C[W tries to live

VIP: very important point: This is one bad thing, that you lost points by losing your stones there, and further getting attacked on the upper side. But please be aware: a further catastrophic thing is that you lost your cutting stones R8,R9. Now the whole right side of black is connected and nothing is attackable any more.]
;B[rr];W[qr];B[rp];W[qq];B[qp];W[pr];B[ni]LB[oe:B][nf:A]C[B: You should be able to see that your chances in this fight are better if you would have played A instead of B earlier. The details of the fight are complicated, but even without the details that should be obvious.]
(;W[mk];B[mg]
(;W[lf]C[Dont think that white can play M13.  it wont survive the fight. Only chance is to play M14 and fight for the groups on the top.

B: right. It is your best chance in a nearly hopeless position]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[jf];W[je];B[kd];W[id]C[It looks like W's P16 group is stronger than B's L17 group. Both groups are dead, but it seems like White can win semeai if required.

B: Black could play a move like P18. Then Black has something like a base, and white not. Blacks chances are good.]

C[B: Well played!];B[jb];W[ha];B[ob]LB[jg:A]C[It looks very diff. to kill black now, if its not impossible.
B: you could also aim for the cut at A

VIP: Look at possible cutting points. Would there be weak black groups after cutting?]
;W[pa];B[nf];W[me]LB[ld:A]C[B: Oh, empty triangle! Correct shape is A. Might be important for playing M18 later. But hopes are small anyway.]
;B[nc]
(;W[hm]C[Huge advantage for black. entire top right corner is black. If white cannot kill anything significant its over.
B: But your move does not try to kill anything. Black should just take out the Aji by playing K12 or so.]
;B[jo]C[Too small? cant see what B wants to achieve here.
B: right. Black should take all the Aji out of the position instead.]
;W[jp];B[in];W[hn];B[ik];W[gk]C[B: Looks like a neutral point to me. What was the aim?]
;B[hj];W[il];B[jl];W[jk]LB[od:A][oj:B]C[B's groups in the center are still cut off and not really alive. last struggle from W to achieve something here.

B: well, they are alive. As Black  can take out one of your dead groups A or B. The only weakness left is the cut at K13.]
;B[jj];W[kk];B[sq];W[ki]C[very difficult for W to achieve anything here. B has multiple options to connect and/or live.]
(;B[jh]C[B: Now black connected the cut and the game is over. And correctly you resigned a few moves later.]
