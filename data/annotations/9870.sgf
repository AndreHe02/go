C[Hello!
Thanks for reviewing my game.

AlGebr: Hello! Thank you too for your wish to play better. To help your reading, I'll mark my comments with 'A'.]

(;B[cq];W[eq];B[fn];W[go]
(;B[cr]C[A: I'd like to play B4, because otherwise you'll leave a cut. Can White cut immediately or not, depends on the ladder (see variation.)]

(;W[jq];B[cn]C[A: Two moves to defense one corner - too much.]
;W[od]TR[cf]C[A: I'd prefer a pincer here - with your stones E6 and F6 and White's D17, the triangled spot is a very big place for both. So, a pincer aims to: 1)get some support stones on the top, 2)don't let White strengthen his stone so easily.]
;B[oc];W[nc];B[pc];W[nd];B[qf];W[cf];B[kd]C[That was to most direct attack i could think of. Is there any better way? Or anywhere obviously better?

A: This is good. If you go on the third line, it will take longer for your stones to go out, and White stones may become ahead. If you go elsewhere, White will play K16, threatening to get a big territory.]
;W[ic];B[lb]LB[mb:1][jc:2][id:3][kf:4]C[I thought i should break off the connection (1), while threatening to connect.

A: Good idea, but White can play 1, cutting you back and threatening to connect (or, at least, live by capturing a stone). I'd think of Black 2 - White 3 - Black 4 instead.]
;W[ie];B[kf];W[qn]
(;B[ql]C[A: If White lives on the side, it's much easier for him to take O16 stones out, so the idea of pincering is correct. But a high pincer suits better for the following fight - and here, with a low pincer, White has a nice plan.]

(;W[nq];B[pn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pq];B[qo];W[qq]C[A: White decided instead to take territory, leaving his stones to run towards Black's thickness. Too greedy.]

(;B[dj]CR[mg]C[Maybe n13 or so instead?

A: Of course. After Black O13, White's D11 (or so) is not enough. That's why Black D10 is unnecessary now.]

LB[lj:1][nk:2][ll:3][nm:4][lp:5]C[A: This helps White to secure his territory. Why not to attack first? For example, Black 1 - White 2 - B. 3 - W.4 creates a good center potential in sente, and White's area can be reduced with 5 at any time.]

[ik:8][kk:9][cn:1][mo:7]C[A: Let's overview what happened in this game.

Black made an additional move (1) in the first corner, so White took sente for (2). Black went for the corner (3), so White created some territory too (4 & 5), planning to save his stones (2) later.

In the bottom-right corner White exchanged corner for Black's thickness, leaving right side in danger to become Black's moyo. But Black chose another side (6), and White's stones (2) were saved more or less comfortable.

After an overplaying double-hane (7) on the side, Black took his stones out up to (8), but White's group became stronger in the center (9).

Finally, the invasion (10) was very severe, but later Black managed neither to kill White (thanks to (9) stones) nor to win in the endgame after White's cut (11).

I recommend for improving:
1) Pay some attention to the shapes. Capture some stones, jump out, prevent a connection in sente, guess a joseki move, make a sabaki, etc - that's all about shapes.
2)Pay some attention to the endgame. On the one hand, it may seem boring and involves only counting - but on the other hand, it involves some tesujis, helps to estimate the position accurately and to win in any close game.
