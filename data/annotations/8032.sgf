C[Hi! I'm Black. I won this game, but there were a number of difficult spots where it was hard to decide what to do. This game was played on DGS. I've marked some variations, so please take a look at them.

Forfun (hereafter ff) - Thanks for an interesting game. It was fun to analyze. Let's see what we can learn from it. I thought that both sides put up a hard fight. It was interesting that they had very different views of how to handle the game.  Black was very concerned about the bad aji in the position and played several safety-first moves that I thought were probably unnecessary. On the other hand, White thought nothing of playing here and there without worrying about the safety of the stones already on the board. Both players could benefit from a more balanced view of the situation :-)]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq];W[hq]
(;B[en];W[cm];B[dl]C[ff - I think this is a little unusual when the upper left corner is White.  A direct counter-pincer around L3 would be more typical.  The point is that White is absolutely going to push through and cut here.  When that happens, can Black reasonably expect to get full value out of the cut stones facing the White position in the upper left at the same time that the situation on the bottom side of the board is unsettled?  It is not impossible, but it is difficult.  That means there are more opportunities for White to exploit.]
;W[dm];B[em];W[el]
(;B[dj]C[ff - This is being a bit optimistic.  What did Black plan to do if White captured the cutting stone?  See the variation.  I think Black should have played C8 here. See the variation...]
(;W[fl];B[cl];W[ep]C[I was surprised by this move. I thought my opponent would follow joseki.

ff - This is unusual timing.  The idea of cutting across the 2-space jump is common.  However, usually it is done immediately after the jump.  The trouble with waiting until now is that there is the danger that the White stones played earlier will turn out to be a loss.]
(;B[cn]C[This seems to be the only good response, but I'm worried about the bad aji of the sequence starting with b.

ff - This is certainly one way to play. Black aims to make the stones that White played on the left ineffective. It is possible to consider playing F4 as well. That is the usual idea when White tries to cut the two-space jump earlier.  It is less clear how it would turn out here. See the variation...

I think that Black was too concerned with the aji here.  There is nothing that White can really do with these stones.]
(;W[dq]C[ff - How does this situation compare to the variation on move 7 earlier?  There are four more White stones and four more Black stones.  However, the two White stones at D7 are captured.  I think that White should be disappointed at the present situation.]
;B[ce]C[I felt that I needed to prevent the enclosure, but am not sure about this due to the aji of B7.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[ff - I think that Black did not end up with a particularly interesting position from this pincer.  Black should be considering how to answer this and also how to take advantage of the unfinished situation in the upper left.]
;W[ne];B[pf]C[I would have prefered to play low at R14, but I thought it was too low in this situation.

ff - I agree with what you played.  If Black wants to play R14 here, then do so directly without playing M17.  However, Black really wants to finess the top.  In order to do so, Black has to keep pressure on White.  This can not happen with plays like R14.]
;W[kd]C[ff - This feels just right with the situation to the left.  I do not think that Black is happy here.  Either Black should not follow joseki or the original pincer should have been different.]
(;B[kc];W[jd];B[ld];W[le];B[jc];W[id];B[hc];W[fc]C[ff - This hurts.  White has successfully returned to the upper left first.]
;B[hd];W[kf]
(;B[gb]C[I felt that this move was necessary to protect the weakness at J18.

ff - What is Black's next play here?  A play like this on the second line can not be just a defensive play this early in the game.  What is the plan against the upper left corner?  Otherwise, see the variation...

Basically Black worries too much about what White might do to Black without thinking about what Black can do to White in return. Naturally as a result, Black makes too many defensive plays.]
;W[cd];B[de];W[bd];B[be]C[This move felt way too slow, but I am still unsure about the aji at B7]
;W[fb]
(;B[oc]C[ff - Understandable perhaps, but small.  See the variation...]
;W[qh]C[ff - White invites Black to separate the stones...]
;B[og]C[ff - Black accepts the invitation. This is the right idea. The question at this point in the game is how White will handle the floating group in the upper side and conversly how Black will attack it.]
;W[qc]C[ff - White wants everything.  The last two plays have been unreasonable.]
(;B[nb];W[re]C[I expected white to play R15. Would it have been better?

ff - That depends on what Black would choose to play against it.  Since you expected it, what did you expect to answer? :-) 

Generally questions like this will not help us improve. It is irrelevant whether our opponent had a better play or not (in reality at our level the answer is almost always "yes!"). The question is what answer did we have ready and would the result have been better or worse than the game?]
;B[rf];W[qe];B[qf]
(;W[pb]C[ff - Does White back down? See the variation...];B[nd]
;W[rb]C[ff - White lives in the corner in gote.  Meanwhile the strategic situation on the outside is unaffected.  White is separated into two weak groups while Black is safely connected. The tactical situation has changed somewhat since the White stones have been weakened by Black's additional plays. So what should Black do?]
(;B[oe]C[ff - Black should definitely not add another play to a safe group.  ::-)  It would be interesting to know what Black was thinking here.  This seems like a wasted play.]
;W[qn]C[ff - White gets to play first on the right.];B[qk];W[qq]
;B[qp];W[pp];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[op];B[qo];W[rr]
(;B[mp]C[This was a hard decision. At first I wanted to play at O5, but I was concerned that the bottom could become too big for white. I now think it may have been better.

ff - Again Black worries about White's opportunities without considering Black's counter chances. The stone on H3 is low and it is not obvious how White would build up the bottom.  Playing at N4 in the game invites White to split Black.  In general it does not seem to fit the situation well.]
;W[oo];B[pn]
(;W[rp]C[ff - Of course White should keep right on pushing at P6...]
(;B[ro]C[ff - Black just follows White's lead.  This should be at P6...]
;W[sq]C[Unexpected. This looks like endgame to me.

ff - In that case, did you consider S5 an endgame play as well? Black got lucky here.  Both sides lost track of the main point for the last few plays.]
;B[on];W[oq]
(;B[kh];W[mh];B[mg]C[I thought that it was apropriate to finally begin the attack on this group, but the next sequence makes me think I should have defended on the bottom.

ff - Personally I think your instincts during the game were correct. There is no way that White should be able to play away from the top at this point.  However, see the variation on the last previous play...]
;W[nn];B[nm];W[mm]C[I thought this was an overplay at first, but it seems to work surprisingly well.]
;B[mn];W[no]
(;B[nl]C[This was the hardest decision of the game. I wanted to play N4, but... (see variation)

ff - I am not sure whether you are claiming to have read the variations you show here during the game.  If you are, then it just shows the danger of reading long variations - you end up missing the critical ones! :-)  See additional variations...

Nevertheless, I think pulling back here is the more reasonable approach. Black is not behind in this game. There is no reason for an all-out fight.]
;W[lm];B[ip];W[ko];B[hp];W[gq]
(;B[hm]C[ff - This play does not prevent White from connecting the two White stones at F8.  Black should probably play E5 first.  See the variation...]
;W[mj]C[ff - This is a tremendous overplay by White.  The N12 stone threatens nothing - but White decides to put it in motion anyway.]
(;B[oi]C[ff - Black protects live stones on both sides.  See the variation...]
;W[fj]
(;B[ei]C[This was hard to decide. I wanted to play more of an attacking move, like k13, but felt that I could not due to the B7 aji.

ff - Black continues to overrate White's potential here.  See the variation...]
;W[ik]
(;B[gn]C[ff - A passive defensive play (that does not even connect the stones).  See the variation...]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[jf];B[ih];W[hg];B[hh]C[This sequence seems bad for black, but I felt that I needed to prevent white from getting  much territiory in the center.

ff - Generally pushing from behind is a poor idea. Here again Black is putting too much faith in White's potential. In order to prevent White from making a few points in the center, Black pushes White into Black's own territory in the left. Black gets lucky when White refuses to be pushed!]
(;W[he]C[ff - White, who has been playing boldly up until now, suddenly becomes conservative. However, the timing is unfortunate.  White should continue to push ahead.  See the variation...]
(;B[nh]C[ff - Black once again plays a safe move where there is no threat. See the variation...]
;W[fg];B[mi]C[ff - To take the words out of Black's mouth (see comment on next play), this is too slow.  Black is in trouble!]
(;W[kk]C[This seemed too slow. I think if white plays D13, I am in trouble.

ff - I fully agree, see the variation...];B[ef];W[gh]C[Another slow move. I think, if not for so many slow moves like this, I would have lost.]
;B[kp];W[sf];B[sg];W[se];B[rg];W[so];B[rn];W[sn];B[sm];W[sp]
;B[rm];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bg];W[fn]C[ff - This simply does not work. White should have played the sequence starting with B7.]
;B[eo]C[ff - Black occupies the key point here.];W[fo];B[fm]
;W[fp];B[iq];W[gl];B[gm];W[mo]C[I think White wins if he plays N2 instead.

ff - The last series has been very unfortunate for White. Essentially White has "forced" Black to settle the bad aji on the left and solidly connect in the center - two things Black wanted to do anyway. Finally White has captured the single Black stone in gote. Black seizes the opportunity that White offers and goes on to win the game.

(;B[lk]C[ff - The only move.  After playing S5, N6, N13, and P15, Black should welcome the fight. It is unreasonable for White to expect to live everywhere.
