C[Degan 
[16k?\]: Hello];B[pc]C[ikunobu [15k\]: hello evs: my standard opening, I 
like the 4,3 - 5,3 shimari to protect a corner.];W[dp];B[cn]
C[evs: think 
that as black I can afford to approach and will still get to play first at 
another corner, besides, I have no preference with other corner.  vlkplk: At 
this stage of the game it's hard to say what to do. Bla ck can do anything 
he wants to, anyway, the standard conservative opinion is, that black  has 
the advantage, so  he should play not ag ressively.];W[pp];B[cd]
C[vlkplk: 
It's fine from black to take the last corner like this. The pattern on the 
board is still preferable for black now.];W[ed];B[dc]C[evs: I decide to 
defend first, is this too small? vlkplk: Not a bad move  It's a matter of 
taste. As my opinion it's ok. As black is one move ahead, he can afford 
something like defending strategy.];W[de]
(;B[bf]C[evs: I wanted to keep the lead in the number of stones in the 
area, I debated C15 instead. vlkplk: Now it's a question, which is the best 
move. Who nows all the josekis well? I think, that C15 would be better. As I 
remember, C14 is another possibility, but it depends on the situation in 
lower right corner. As it is now, it's not a good move. (see var.) So C15 
would be a good continuation. Anyway, B14 is not a bad move, considering 
WC15.];W[ec]
(;B[db]C[vlkplk: I like this move from black. It protects the 
corner definitely, while at the same time doesn't help white to take a 
better shape. Moves like this are good, especially at the opening stage of 
the game. (see var.)];W[id]C[vlkplk: Appropriate jump from the white 
wall.];B[bp]C[evs: now I try to build on my approach];W[go]
;B[cq]C[evs: and 
now to try to take the corner vlkplk: It's still with the spirit of black's 
strategy.];W[dq];B[qe]C[evs: I complete the other corner, in retrospect, 
this seems small.vlkplk: It's not a small move at all! As the situation 
looks now,black goes playing for "teritorry" while white for the 
"influence". Both strategies are appropriate.];W[qj]C[vlkplk: One of the 
"big points". It's extension from white's stone in the corner and at the 
same time it reduces black's forces in the upper left corner. Was it black 
to play here, it would be a very big move.]
(;B[nq]C[vlkplk: This is good 
point ofcourse. But now the game is going to it's middle stage. Still, black 
was one move ahead, so some more conservative play was possible (see var.) 
It's possible to avoid playing on this point, since white's corner is still 
open for invasion from black.];W[pn]
(;B[pq]C[evs: a different approach to 
this corner vlkplk: This contact-like play is made usualy, when black is 
under more pressure. It's ok, maybe. I would choose standard Q2, because 
black has still enough room for extension allong the lower 
side.];W[qq]
(;B[oq]C[vlkplk: Standard would be, I think the variation. Once 
black made a CONTACT move, he should DEFINITELY make a living shape! (see 
var.)];W[qr]C[vlkplk: This move from white is usualy very painful. It 
spoils black's eye shape in the future.];B[jq]C[evs: OK? vlkplk: It's ok. 
What to do else? But if white continues to counter-atack black stones, as in 
variation, they are still eyeless and have to escape to the center. In 
future, they would be a good target for white attack.]
(;W[po]C[vlkplk: I 
think its not necessary to connect like this from white. Later he has to 
either approach black's shimari at R13, or protect at R8, if black gets the 
chance to play R13 himself.]
(;B[lc]C[evs: I think the upper right corner 
looks good now   vlkplk: This is ofcourse a big move. But every time, You 
should consider Your weak groups. The best would be some move around G3 to 
protect black group. Considering the fight for teritorry, B M17 is big, but 
already black is peeping into the white moyo from the D18 point. Any time 
black whishes to, he can make some jump like in variation. And the shimari 
Q17-R15 is very tight and safe..];W[hq]C[vlkplk: Now black's lower-side 
group is under serious pressure.];B[cj]C[evs: This seemed to be the largest 
move left vlkplk: Actually, yes. But You have to consider the weakness of 
black lower group! Every time you hould protect the weak points (unless you 
are willing to sacrifice these stones...)];W[dg]C[vlkplk: This white's move 
threatens to separate black's forces along the left side. (see 
var.)];B[jo]
(;W[qg]C[vlkplk: This was very big point. Had a black chance to 
play at R12, white would have to protect soon or later there, for ex. at 
P10.];B[of];W[em]
(;B[dl];W[dn];B[dm];W[en]
(;B[fj]C[vlkplk: Black definitely 
got some profit on the left! But since there is still W C12, black's F10 
should have been somwhere else...(see var.) The 2-point jump is too much 
here, I think.]
(;W[if];B[no]C[evs: I had kept itching to play this for 
several moves vlkplk: It makes the black group living, but puts no pressure 
on white stones at lower left side. Already they are fortified against this 
kind of move.];W[ol]
(;B[jj]C[evs: instead of building out to the center, I 
often jump out to tengen, thinking I can connect out from at least one of my 
groups and it will be beneficial once I'm out there.  vlkplk: It doesn't 
seems now so an influential point. Still You could make some big moves in 
the sense of territory, for ex. as J18, or protect at 
C12.];W[eb]
(;B[dd]C[vlkplk: At this time black had to play definitely 
something like J18 to counter white's territory and to enlarge his 
own.];W[ce];B[be];W[cg];B[bg];W[ci]
(;B[ch]C[evs: I wasn't sure what to do 
here.  This doesn't seem perfect. I wanted to keep my top and bottom groups 
connected.  vlkplk: This is the right idea. How to provide this, see 
variation.];W[dh]
(;B[bh];W[dj]
(;B[ek]C[evs: I'm thinking that is I can 
connect to the center I can squeeze his group in the lower left and maybe 
kill it. vlkplk: No hope to kill a big and strong group like this. After 
white move at D10, still black had the means to connect.. (viz. 
var.)];W[bj];B[bi];W[ck]C[vlkplk: Bad result for 
black.];B[bm];W[dr];B[cr]C[vlkplk: This black move at C2 is 1.endgame move 
with the value of some 3 or 4 points 2.the move made for securing eye space 
in the corner. Neither of theese two reasons are important at this stage of 
the game. Black's group is already out in the 
center...];W[ip];B[jp];W[io];B[in];W[hn];B[im];W[hm];B[hl];W[ih]

(;B[fh]C[evs: 
trying to reduce the size of this group vlkplk: The important are the 
"boarders" which marks both players territories. This B F12 clearly reduces 
whites territory, but doesn't add to black's one. In the upper-left side of 
the board, there is still one point big for BOTH players-it's the point of 
J18/K18 for black resp. white. So this is the biggest point. The point, 
which is big for either black an 
white!];W[fg];B[hj];W[gh];B[gi];W[eh];B[fi];W[hh];B[lf]C[evs: forming moyo? 
vlkplk: Yes, but usualy, side is bigger (even it doesn't seem 
so)];W[ml]C[vlkplk: Good move to educe black's rather big 
territory.]
(;B[ni]C[vlkplk: What is the meaning of this move? Simply to 
reduce? I would press first, like in variation and than make some 
territory.];W[kh];B[lh];W[ki];B[lj];W[kj];B[kk];W[lk];B[li]
;W[kl];B[jk];W[jl];B[il]C[evs: 
I seem to be on the defensive often. vlkplk: When You press, you should 
expect some counter-attacks usualy. This is general rule of Go. As the game 
is going to it's end-stage, senteh and goteh becomes more important. (they 
are important every time, 
tough)];W[kn]
(;B[jh];W[jg];B[ji];W[kg];B[lg]C[vlkplk: As now, in the real 
sequence, black has to defend finaly.So it was black's 
goteh.];W[jb]C[vlkplk: Even moves plyed before seemed big,actualy this was 
still the best point. Both parts should play it any time 
before!];B[jf];W[je];B[kf];W[ig]
(;B[fl];W[jn]C[vlkplk: Usualy, cut like this 
from white may cost black several point. It's not the danger for black's 
group life, but when they have to make eyes later,it will take some 
additional moves, which would be unnecessary, if black connected at 
K6.];B[ir];W[hr];B[iq];W[hs];B[lp];W[mj];B[nj];W[nk]
(;B[ph];W[qh];B[pj];W[pi];B[oi];W[qi];B[ok];W[pk];B[oj]C[evs: 
this group now seems stupid. vlkplk: The purpose You were playing theese 
moves was probably to push white from up and lessen his territory. You could 
do that more lightly and, sure, don't form heavy group like 
this...];W[ql]C[vlkplk: But at least,white had to respond,so giving black a 
senteh.];B[mi]C[vlkplk: Not so important. Black can easily sacrifice his 
stone at Q12.];W[mk]C[vlkplk: But anyway, white approved black's previous 
move.];B[nm];W[nl];B[lm];W[ll];B[ln];W[ko];B[kp];W[lo];B[mo]
;W[mm];B[mn]C[vlkplk: 
EVERY time, You have to think, whether there are not bigger points on the 
board and not blindly responde each opponent's move. Every time think about 
getting upper hand.];W[om]
(;B[nn]C[evs: another chunk of stones, I wish I 
could have turned this into territory. vlkplk: You can't think about this as 
being a territory, since Your "territory" is open from both sides. Maybe you 
could give up a stone and protect againts monkey jump from white's 
R2.];W[op];B[np];W[ns]C[evs: Arrg!, the money jump. vlkplk: Yes, very big in 
endgame... You had to count with it from the beginning...];B[nr]

should I deal with these?  I hate them.];W[os];B[ms];W[pr];B[lr]

(;B[el]C[evs: 
I probably didn't need to play this. vlkplk: I don't know. Endgame stage is 
VERY difficult... But generally, connecting your groups gives points (they 
don't have to protect themselves 
later).];W[cs];B[bs];W[ds];B[bq];W[co];B[bo];W[cl];B[cm]C[vlkplk: So black 
has to spend one move for connection

connecting allong sides is ussualy bigger than it looks.];W[tt]
