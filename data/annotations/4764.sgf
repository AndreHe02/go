AB[jj][jd][jp][dj][pj][pp][dd][pd][dp]C[RW> Hi my name is Ronald Wopereis, woepwoep on KGS. I will review for black. My comments preceded with RW>]
;W[cn];B[gm]C[RW> with go there are certain basics one needs to know. One of the most basic rules is that you need to touch base at the sides , the corners, or both. 

RW> In practice this means that during the opening - roughly the first 25 moves, you ONLY play on 2nd, 3rd, and 4th line. Only occasionally you play 5th line. Here you play 7th line (G column is 7th, counted as 7th line from the side of the board. And ofcourse row 7 is 7th line too)

RW> In this case white attacks left lower side. So this means there are three more corners not under attack. Here you can secure either on of three corners. You just don´t go with white´s play / relax and play your own game. This way you have a chance to win.]
;W[en];B[em];W[fp];B[eo];W[fo];B[dn];W[cm];B[dm];W[bj]C[RW> white is very happy. he is practically forced to make territory. See how white first touches base?]
;B[ck];W[cf];B[ch]C[RW> very good move by black. The reason why this is good is that this single move serves TWO purposes: it strengthens black C9/D10 AND it squeezes white C14. White is now forced to defend, which makes him predictable. Good move !]
;W[ef];B[gf]C[RW> again, black should here stay on lines 18-17-16-15. Best here is maybe G17. Then black has a firm base, and can extend from there.]

;W[jg];B[kg];W[je];B[ke];W[fc];B[ed];W[ic];B[fb];W[jc];B[kc]
;W[kb];B[lb];W[ja];B[la];W[bd];B[cc]C[RW> good move by black]
;W[hf];B[hg];W[ig]C[RW> white is showing black that his four (4) moves J14, H13, G14 and F14 are a waste. And now black has to even use more moves to save these four.

RW> White has now touched base on K19. He can expand easily from J13 onwards.]

;B[bl];W[cl];B[bm];W[bn];B[dl];W[qc];B[oh];W[qd]C[RW> have a look: why does white not play Q13 and defend the two white stones? The answer is : because white knows that losing two stones (Q11/Q12) does not add up to winning twenty stones in the corner (R17-R16 area)]
;B[pg];W[pc];B[oc];W[bc];B[bb];W[cd];B[dc]C[RW> good defense by black. should be safe now.]
;W[ab];B[ec];W[ob];B[nb];W[od]C[RW> this is called double attack. white attacks two black stones (P17 and Q16) with only one white stone (P16). Review how white does it - it is powerfull.]
;B[pe];W[nc];B[mc];W[om];B[nd];W[nl]C[RW> again white is not interested in saving one white stone (O17). he's looking to connect O8 with K13]
;B[oc];W[nq];B[oq];W[nr];B[or]C[RW> good defense. this way only few black stones are needed to win corner territory]
;W[kp];B[lp];W[jo];B[ko];W[kq];B[lo];W[qq];B[qr];W[mm];B[qo]
;W[kn];B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[op];B[oo];W[lr];B[np];W[mr];B[mo]
;W[rp];B[mp]C[RW> good move for black. it saves the N4 group. The black N4 group is called a ´heavy´ group because it costs 9 moves and returns zero territory. 

RW> In go every stone placed is one less point for either one. So instead of saving 9 stones in N4, maybe one black move at S5 could return 20 points for black in the right lower corner, plus the capturing of the two white stones (S4 and R3) - thus compensating for the loss of 9 stones.]

[cj][bb][aa]C[White wins by 1.5 points.

RW> summary: white is much stronger than black. the 9 stones ahead barely compensate this fact. Nevertheless, black has done a great job at creating eyes - one of the fundamental skills in go.

RW> black needs to learn how to not feel offended, and play his own game. when black sticks to the rule that he should touch base first and not play above the fifth line in the opening, he will be improving his game very quickly.

Good luck and happy playing !
