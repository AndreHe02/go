AB[pd][dp]C[Brakeshoe- Thanks for reviewing the game, I've put comments throughout the game.

Zamoth : High, I'm zamoth, and i'll try to review this game the best way.]
;W[qp];B[dc];W[nd];B[op];W[pp];B[oq];W[qf];B[qe]TR[pf]C[Zamoth : I usually play Q14, this enclose you in the corner]
;W[pf];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb]TR[qb][rd]C[Zamoth : See, you are almost totally enclosed, and you have aji too]
;B[qk];W[qm];B[qh]TR[pf][qf][ph]C[Zamoth : So many wide opened large space ... Why playing in the middle of two white groups ?
If white starts to attack, and strenthen Q14 group (Q12 for example), this will make top right group even weaker.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[qb]C[Zamoth, there is the attack];B[od];W[nc]
;B[of]SQ[oe]C[Zamoth : Luck you. P15 could have killed the corner]
(;W[pe];B[oe];W[pg];B[pb];W[og]
(;B[rd];W[re];B[qd];W[se];B[rb];W[rl]
(;B[rk]CR[oi]C[Zamoth : Bad. This does give an eye, but do not makeThis does not give 2 eyes, Does not bother much white, does not flee.

Now let's look at positions :
P4 black 2 stones are light ... nothing to worry for the moment
R4-R7 white group is setteled ...
R18 black is setteled
O3 white group does not have an eye yet
R14 white group does not have an eye yet (black T13, or even black R13 removes the eye)

As this group is under attack, try to flee
As the proverb says, push toward thickness, it is usually good to flee thickness

I would have played P13, or something like that, withou hesitation, as it is sente, white will have to flee. Even if white plays S9 or S10, at this point of the game, it is very small to make points on the second line

Any way, this situation happened, because you tried to reduce white's moyo too early in this game]
;W[pi]C[Zamoth : Now white only has one weak group : O17];B[ok]
C[Brakeshoe- Felt I couldn't just defend here, would have been too small maybe I was dead

Zamoth : At this time, this is a good move];W[pj];B[pk];W[ni]
(;B[mf]TR[on]C[zamoth : This is wrong.  You're making flee a living goup, without taking car of your weak group. I would have played S6.  It connects groups, or allorws or group to flee]
;W[ld]C[Zamoth : now white's bottom group is stronger];B[jc]
C[Brakeshoe- Stealing a base in sente

Zamoth : This move is ok ...];W[kc];B[jb];W[jd];B[id];W[je]
;B[ie];W[jf];B[if]C[Brakeshoe- This is some good thickness for upper left, maybe I had to put a shimari right away and forget right.

Zamoth : this white group is not yet a fuly linving group.  But it does deserve the plan you are tying to build]
;W[om]C[Zamoth : Ouch !];B[mk];W[nj];B[nk];W[lh];B[ce]C[Brakeshoe-  Here it is

Zamoth : makes points, and makes white jealous ... but this D17 stone is trong.
R9 group does not have 2 eyes yet
P4 group, after P7, is starting to feel oppressed
I would have played one or the other instead];W[mm];B[kk];W[ll]
;B[lk];W[mq]C[Brakeshoe-  Trouble ahead

Zamoth : The game does not depend on two lonely surrounded stones.  I would leave them, and try to save them later.  Look at the game.  You got a huge corner moyo top left.  You got a big corner top right  White only has the bottom right corner, and it is not safe yet.  Maybe I would play K13 in sente, then D10]
(;B[qr];W[nr];B[or]TR[rq]C[zamoth : This does not make an eye, again, you can sacrifice this two stones.  Play S3, try to live, then try to rescue those 2 stones]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[sr];B[qq];W[rp]
(;B[nq]C[Zamoth : don't play those shapes, heavy, does not make an eye]
;W[lr];B[nn];W[nm];B[mp];W[lp];B[mo];W[oo]
(;B[pn]C[Brakeshoe- M5 prefered

Zamoth : R6 is not a good play.  does not saves your bottom group, does not cut white.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[po];B[ql];W[qn];B[rm];W[rn]
(;B[sm];W[sn]
(;B[sl]C[zamoth : at least, this group is now safe];W[lo];B[ik]
;W[cn];B[co];W[dn];B[kq];W[lq];B[hp];W[cj];B[dl]C[zamoth : Ugly play.  creates you another weak group.  C12 is much better]
;W[cl];B[dm];W[cm];B[jg];W[kg];B[jh];W[lf];B[ch];W[dk];B[fq]
;W[fn]C[Brakeshoe- Right now I'm happy he spent that many stones on such a small area.]
;B[bo];W[di];B[dh];W[fi];B[eh];W[ei];B[ii]C[Brakeshoe- Maybe I've wasted a move in a race where I wasn't ahead]
;W[gh];B[ff];W[gf];B[ge];W[fg];B[ef];W[jq];B[iq];W[jp];B[jr]
;W[kr];B[ir];W[kb];B[ib]C[zamoth : play J17 instead.];W[gl]
;B[ns];W[mr]TR[bi][bn]SQ[me][sg][gj][gk][jn]C[Brakeshoe- And I resigned

Zamoth : Why did you resign.  With cauth up with the score, but you are still ahead ! You got 2 huge corners, and a big one. you only have living groups (besides P2).  You have big sente moves (trianles), and othe smaller sente moves (square).  This is a winning black game ! count before resigning !]

(;B[re]CR[rc]TR[mf]SQ[rf]C[Zamoth : I like this move better because, even if it creates more aji at s17, this group can :
 - flee (triangle)
 - Connect (square)
- live (circle)

So it is pretty confortable I guess]))
