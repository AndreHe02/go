C[syoukei: Hi!
Mineteaser: hello

-- Hello, my name is Sven and I am about 7 kyu at DGS and KGS.
All my comments are preceeded by '--' so you can more easily spot them.

-- Essentially, this game was rather well-balanced despite the formal difference in rank (though I would not expect you to be 30k when having played before). As for local reading abilities I did not notice a major difference between the to opponents. 
The most potential for Black's improvement here is in thinking more globally i. e. considering the overall impact and value of each move instead of trying to win a local fight which is often worth just a few points.]
