C[I, kevco, 3k, am playing black.

Ok, I am Thomas, 3d, and will do my best. Sorry for my bad english.]
;B[pd];W[po]C[I don't like this play, w Q5, as I am never sure of a good approach when the time comes.]
;B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[jj];B[cj]LB[jq:a]C[Without the white tengen I would normally play the star point. How does the tengen affect b c9, c10? Should I play high to cancel his influence, or low to keep a better base?




To difficult questions for me :), perhaps its a matter of style, I would play c10 locally but prefer a (k3).]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[pg];B[nd];W[ph];B[qi];W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[ql]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[qj]C[thats not necessary now. perhaps white wants to play s10 later.]
;B[rj];W[pm];B[qn];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[kp]C[I'm open to ideas here.

it looks not bad, I have no better idea. Of course its not possible to take white everything, and in front of whites power you have to be very carefull.]
;W[ip];B[np];W[oq];B[nq];W[jq];B[op]LB[or:a][lr:b]C[a (p2) seems better to me for getting eyes. this way later white can invade around b (m2).]
;W[pq];B[kq];W[in];B[rn];W[nn];B[jr];W[ir];B[jp]C[I woundnt atari now. perhaps later, if the black group lives you may use h3.]
;W[iq];B[kn]LB[mn:a]C[Here I would prefer a (n6) to use the weakness of white.]
;W[kl];B[mn];W[nm];B[mm];W[nl]LB[ml:a]C[better a (n8)];B[jm]
;W[hl];B[or];W[pr];B[nr];W[hc]LB[cl:a][cn:b]C[Again, I could use advice here.

Because white a (c8) looks so good to me, I propably would ignore this move and play b (c6).]
;B[jc];W[cf];B[fc]LB[gd:a]C[Because of the distance to w H17 I didn't like b D14, but I don't know of a better response. I think I really went bad a few moves down the line.


With a (g16) white would have a harder time. Try out some variations. Even if manages to live, the c14 stone would get very weak.]
;W[he];B[ce];W[df];B[cm]C[Should this have been b F15 instead?

Yes, I think so.];W[co];B[jf]C[Or now?

Yes, I think so :)];W[hg];B[bf];W[bg];B[em]LB[dl:a][bk:b]C[this leaves the sequence a (d8) and b (b9) for white. this would be very dangerous.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[rd];B[pc];W[rb];B[qb];W[rc];B[nf]LB[ej:a]C[a move around a (e10) seems more important to me. 
So what about territory now: (rough estimation)

white: about 30 left, + 5 bottom right + 5 upper right + 5 komi + ??? in the middle aera. = 45 + ??

black: 15 upper left + 10 right side + 5 bottom group + 20 upside + 2 (hopefully :)) left group. = 52

that means, white needs about 10 points in the middle aera, and propably he will get more, so white has a definite lead to my opinion.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[af];B[ad];W[fe]LB[dl:a][bk:b]C[white don´t need to connect here any more.
better the a-b combination for example.]
(;B[fd]C[why? this is gote. there is no danger, see var.];W[ee]
C[to small. better attack the left black group.];B[gb]C[to small]
;W[hb]LB[ej:a]C[to small :) even a (e10) would be a much bigger move]
;B[bn];W[bo]LB[ej:a]C[a would be bigger, i guess.];B[ao];W[ap]
LB[ej:a]C[again a seems bigger to me.];B[an];W[bq];B[ej];W[ka]

;B[la];W[jb];B[lb];W[fn];B[sp];W[rq];B[en];W[eo];B[fm]
(;W[gn]LB[pb:a][mg:b]C[a or b would be much bigger for example. see var.]
;B[mh]LB[lg:a]C[Is there a better choice here? See the reduction coming.


thats very complicated, i dont dare to decide. But if you are not confident for fight, just play a (m13) instead.]
;W[lg];B[mg];W[ke]C[that looks like an overplay. see var.]

;B[fb];W[cc];B[cb]C[I get lucky, he could have played this better I believe.

yes, you have been lucky. 

here the comment ends. the main thing I like to mention again is the fact, that both players didn´t notice the weaknes of the two black stones on the left side and the big potential for white that results of this weakness.]
