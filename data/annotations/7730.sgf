C[Hi reviewer,

My name is Jan and I play as "PeatMan" on IGS. (and since recently occasionally on DGS.) I added comments but please comment on anything you think is worth commenting about and that might help me to become stronger.

This game was played on 25th of februari 2010 on IGS-Pandanet with my usual settings: 1 minute initial time, with (Canadian) byoyomi 25 stones/10 minutes.
My comments are indicated by "J:". I use glGo as editor and I just discovered I can give names to moves. For your convenience I indicated commented moves with "#".

Thank you in advance for commenting my game!];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd]
;W[ed]C[J:
Strange. Usually one would put a stone in the last empty corner.

R:
It is indeed unusual, but it's playable.];B[pq]C[J:
So I'm going to place one there. Can I afford it to ignore E16 for the moment?

R:
Yes. If you would have played 3 at 5, playing 5 at the 3-4 point in the upper left is not so strange.]
;W[po];B[ql];W[qo]C[J:
Isn't this too slow?

R:
I think it is. It's difficult to say what white's best move is here.]
(;B[rq]C[J:
 I wanted to rob him from his possible base with this move.

R:
This way white can easily put pressure on black, as he does in the game. After that, black has a small corner and white is strong, so he doesn't really need a base that much any more. Black should play a move to prevent this pressure. See variation.]
;W[op];B[oq];W[nq];B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lq]LB[mr:A]TR[ql]C[J:
One of my problems is knowing when to tenuki.
I think I did it right this time. Do you Agree?
My group lives, and I want to grab some territory in the upper right.

Looking at this situation now I think he should tenuki and somehow should have attacked my marked stone.

R:
Yes, this is the right time to tenuki. Crawling on the second line is not what you want and playing tenuki one move earlier would leave white the option to play A in sente]
;B[qi];W[qf]LB[ic:A][cf:B]TR[qi][ql]C[J:
Isn't white a little greedy?  Around "A" would make more sense. Or pincer my corner stone around "B".

R:
I think white wants to put his thickness at the bottom to use. If black gets a stone around this place, it becomes a bit worthless. If white succeeds in separating the marked stones from the corner, he may be able to put some pressure on them.]
;B[qd]LB[pf:B][ic:A]TR[ed]MA[qf]C[J:
Attacking around "A" would be better. Let him have the corner and make more territory on the upper side would be better for black.
On the other hand: I'm attacking the marked stone this way.

Playing "B" would also be an alternative, I think. I could form a wall, but I have to end attacking around "A". Otherwise my wall is useless.

R:
I think B would be good. The continuation is not so easy, but B works more toward connecting black's two stones in front of white's thickness to the corner stone. The marked white stone is not settled yet, so if this would result in a wall this would not be bad for black.]
(;W[nc]C[J:
Agressive. Too agressive? How to take advantage?]
(;B[oe]C[J:
I was tryijng to keep R14 and O17 separated, but I also would have accomplished that with O16.
 I should have made a wall and kill R14. Possible?

R:
Separating the stones is certainly a good idea. I think the move you played is good. It would be possible to play O16, build a wall and kill R14, but that's not a good idea (see variation).]
;W[pg]
(;B[me]TR[nc]C[R:
I think black should put a little more pressure on the marked stone. See variation.]
;W[nd]TR[pg][qf]C[J:
This only makes black stronger, I think,  but ... (see move 26)

R:
Yes, this move doesn't do much for white. He should just escape with his marked stones.]
;B[ne];W[ld]C[J:
... he can block me now at L15 if I walk on, or cut me if I go to far.]
;B[df]LB[oh:A]C[R:
This move should be at A, that would not only capture the two white stones but also prevent an attack against the two black stones.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[ef];B[dg];W[eg];B[ck];W[cm]LB[cn:A][oh:B]C[J:
Nice. This gives me the opportunity to invade at the 3-3 point later. I think "A" is better.

R:
Perhaps, I find it difficult to say which is better. I think B is white's best move.]
;B[eh]LB[nh:A]MA[pg][qf]C[J:
Maybe this was a little too much. Extending would be better.

Even better mikght be "A". Kiling or otherwise sealing the marked group.

R:
Killing the marked group would indeed be best. This move is not so important. Black is already save here,  it doesn't create much territory and it does indeed leave too many weak points.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[ci];W[ei];B[fh]LB[oh:A]C[J:
I shouldn't bother about E12 and jump from N15 into his mojo. (and be cut?)

R:
Black should still play at A. It would probably be better not to run with this stone now. If white wants to capture, you get an extra move somewhere else and if white doesn't capture you can first prepare the run.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[gf];B[ih]LB[eh:A]C[J:
This weak group gives him the opportunity to make the upperside save white territory. Not so good for black, I think. That's why I probably should have left "A".

R:
Yes, running with "A" was probably premature.];W[hg]C[J:
White likes to make black stronger.];B[hh];W[dl];B[jf]LB[nh:A]
C[J:
I want to connect.
But (as previously stated) around "A" would be better to connect and to seal or kill the isolated white group.

R:
I think one point to the right of "A" would be better, but the idea to prevent the white stones from escaping and attacking the two black stones is good.]
;W[jd]LB[ig:A]C[J:
"A" would give him the opportunity to cut.

R:
This cut could really complicate things. I'm not strong enough to see how that would continue.]
(;B[ig]C[R:
I think it would be better to defend the cut more indirectly, in a way which prevents the white stones from escaping. See variation.]
;W[ie]
(;B[fq]C[J:
I definitely have to invade in the lower left.
I invaded at F3 but maybe taking the corner would be better and then make use of the opening at M2 by placing L2 to reduce. See variation.
Would this be reasonable?

R:
Taking the corner in sente is a bit too much to expect I think. See variation.]
;W[dq];B[iq];W[pi]C[J:
OK. Re-enforcing this group is nescessary for white.

R:
This was the most important issue for a long time.];B[pj];W[oi]
(;B[li]LB[pg:C][ig:B][qi:A]SQ[me][ne][oe][pd][qd]MA[eh][fh]
[gh][hh][ih][jf]C[J:
I felt I needed to protect my somewhat ramshackle connection between the marked groups.

In the game, until  (+/-) move 80, my middle right group (A") got cut off from group "B". Was there a way to prevent this and seal the white group "C" in?
I think the solution would be as I remarked at move 49.
Other idea's or better strategies?

R:
It's difficult. I think white should play from the direction of group A since that one looks like black's weakest part. At this point white needs to escape or live with his stones and does not have time to cut the two marked groups apart. The variation is a good continuation for both sides I think.]
;W[qh];B[ri];W[oj];B[pk];W[nk];B[lk]C[J:
I  don't want him to make a large centre-mojo.];W[mg];B[lf]
LB[lg:A][lf:B]C[J:
Instinct said I should play "A" but I could resist my instinc and make better shape with "B".]
;W[om];B[ok]C[J:
This was not so good. It makes white strong and I gain nothing and so ... (see next move)]
;W[mk]C[J:
...  I hurt myself..];B[rn]LB[ok:A]C[J:
I needed eyespace for my group. I should have done this one instead of "A".]

Isn't this white move too small?

R:
Yes, it is. A is bigger.];B[eb];W[fa];B[rk]LB[ol:B][pl:A]C[J:
This felt save, but I think it was too early to make this move.
Only if "A" and "B" are played by white I should make this move.
But maybe even then..

R:
If white would play A and B, this would certainly be neccesary, but at this point white has no attack against the black group.]
(;W[qp]C[J:
Small move?

R:
White should play between the black stones. See variation.]
(;B[qq]C[J:
I react anyway: It doesn't gain much for white but it threathens to play inside my group and cause lots of trouble.

Looks like another gote move, but I could have tenukied after this move.

But if you would tenuki after this move, it would be better to leave it unplayed.]

The connection is not so valuable. Better take point with 'A'.]

What does this move do? Take "A" to make a point.

This move reduces black's territory, but "A" would indeed be better because it would not only make a point but also white would not have to capture the marked black stone]

I was lucky he blocked the other side. He could capture by playing "A" without real danger. See also variation.]

Not nescessary.];B[pp];W[pl]MA[np]C[J:
Dame, but there's not much else.
That is: if you don't want to play safe at (let's say) O4.

R:
If white defends now, he can be sure to lose by 0.5 points so has to take the chance that black makes a mistake.]

Wrong move. See variations.

With a 1/2 point difference any wrong move is a losing move but so close to the end this is definitely one. I missed it.]
