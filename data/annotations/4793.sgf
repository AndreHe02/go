C[hello reviewer!!
i played this game as white on kgs. me and my opponent were 12kyu.
i found some mistakes on my own, but i am sure, that there are many stupid mistakes, i haven't seen :D
maybe you have some advice for me, that helps me to improve my bad play :)
i think i am very weak in the opening.
thank you very much for investing your time for me :)

You might want to consider playing the Q8 stone low at R8 or R9, since having two high stones is harder to defend as territory.]
;B[pj];W[qh]C[i think r12 is not good and can easily be attacked.
what would be a better response?


My worry about R12 is that if black plays R9 or R10, white suddenly has two groups to worry about.

I might have played R3 instead of R12.

R3 makes territory plus takes away territory from black.];B[qk]
;W[ql];B[nj];W[oh];B[ed];W[df]C[
Since the P12 stones are still outnumbered, and the C16 stone can take care of itself, perhaps play N12 instead of D14 for a more comfortable position.]
;B[hd];W[mh]C[
glad you got this move in anyway !];B[lj];W[od]C[the three white stones still seemed to be weak, so i hoped i would make some room fors eyes while i attacked the black stones, but i think i played too far away.

I don't like P16 because it lets black play P17 and fix his large-knights-move weakness.

Perhaps instead of P16, just keep jumping with L12.

After L12, white still has choices of R3 or N7 .];B[oe];W[nd]
;B[oc];W[pe];B[pd]C[

Too bad to give black all that corner territory.

Instead of O16, look back and consider Q16.];W[ne];B[md]C[
Black getting more than white];W[me];B[ld]C[
white N15 forces black to make the territory he wants to make anyway.]
;W[dk];B[qe];W[of]C[
white's pon-nuki at P15 is way too close to the P12 wall.];B[fq]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[jp]C[
black has territory on top and bottom, and white only has territory on left.

Perhaps white should consider answering F3 at H3 instead of D6.]
;W[hp]C[i thought k4 is too far away, so i tried to attack.
h4 ok?];B[hq]C[

it's good that white recognized black's poorley placed K4 stone that should have been at H4 instead but H4 is the wrong way to exploit.

go deep with H3 .

(I realize I haven't given details about why H3, or about the weakness of the large knight's move in upper right.  Please look up those things in the books as there's excellent writing about them)]
;W[gp];B[fp]C[
black should just answer at G3, make territory and be safe.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[gr]C[
this is bad for black, being split up like this, and it wasn't necessary to happen.]
;B[fn];W[hm];B[hn];W[in];B[ho];W[io];B[fo];W[ip];B[kq];W[gm]
C[
since black is safe at L3, and since white wants to attack all of the left side black stones, I wouldn't leave the J7 cut available to black.  for example, white j8 both protects the cut, starts to attak the M10 stones, and allows a black g7 move to be answered nicely with white g8 .]
;B[fm];W[fl];B[el]C[

white leaving too many cutting points to worry about.  the g8 and j7 cuts all help black.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[em];B[dl];W[ck]C[
c9 worries about the wrong stones.

It's a viscious battle between the F5 black stones and the d4 white ones.]
;B[ej];W[ch]C[
again, c12 ignoring the big battle.];B[cr]C[
black gets first important move in big battle];W[br];B[dq];W[cp]
;B[cm];W[cn];B[bm];W[bn];B[bs]C[
consider white a2 in answer to this.  looks like white's big eye will win.  white should also consider forcing moves later in this battle at d7 and f2.]
;W[cs]C[i thought, i this prevents black from making two eyes, but black could never make two eyes, so i should have played a2.]
;B[bq];W[as];B[ds];W[bp];B[bs];W[aq];B[ar];W[bq];B[ao];W[an]
;B[fr];W[eo]C[
how about forcing with d7 first.  then after black answers at c8, white can make total life in lower death, and deliver total death to black.

well, it would be total death except for the fact that the j7 and g8 cuts are still there.]
;B[cj];W[dj]C[i should secure my white group in the corner instead, shouldn't i?]
;B[bk];W[ci]C[

white fighting wrong battle again];B[en]C[

interesting game.

no more comments after this.
