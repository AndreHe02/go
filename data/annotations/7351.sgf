C[Hi, I'm Fnor on KGS and I played black in this game.

I made some big mistakes in the endgame because it was late, but i think I can improve the middle game to come ahead in the endgame.

Generally a good game.  White played some unusual moves in the opening.  The important issue in this game were black's upper side framework, white's left side framework, and white weak lower side group.  Black missed several chances to take control of the game by attacking the weak group.  Both side failed to exand their frameworks effectively.  Eventually black made some territory in the center and almost caught up.]

(;B[gd]C[This joseki is a good choice when there is a white stone in the upper right, since the longer extension limits white's influence. With a black stone in the upper right I prefer the solid connection, since it gives you a good base to extend down as well as to the right.]
;W[cf];B[kc];W[qo];B[pl];W[on]C[This move is not Joseki.  I would probably cut immediately and fight.  Your move looks ok too.]

;B[pn];W[pk]C[It's unfortunate that white gets such a strong shape facing your framework.]
;B[jp]
(;W[qd]C[This move is odd.  The normal approach seems better.]

[fd:B][jd:C]C[If you played the solid connection at B earlier, the stone at A would be at C, making a bigger side for you.  The stone at A is a little close to your wall, and too low..]
;W[jq]C[White likes to attach under stones.];B[iq];W[kq];B[ip]
C[Good plan.  Attack by pushing white towards your wall.];W[mq]

(;B[nr]C[Good attacking move.  It looks like peeping from above lets white live.]
;W[lo]
(;B[jn]C[This move is slow.  A general rule is to attack with a knight's move and defend with a one point jump.  You should be thinking about attacking here.]
;W[lm]C[Now white has escaped and your corner is nearly surrounded and you need a move in the lower left.  White's invasion is a success.]
;B[do];W[co]
(;B[dp]C[I would consider moving at C6, to prevent white from making a framework above.  Your choice is also good.]
;W[cp];B[eq];W[dn];B[cq];W[dr];B[bq];W[bp]
(;B[er]C[you should be able to cut at C6 now instead of this move.]

(;B[oj]LB[ml:A][mk:B][nj:C]C[It looks like a good idea to get your A group out to the center. This is not a good way to do it.  If you play at B, white will want to answer at C.  this peep does not prevent that, and just makes it easier for white not to answer.  A ply at M7 followed by a jump is a faster way to go out.

Then you can attack the weak write group.];W[ok];B[mk];W[il]

(;B[fn]C[Another slow move.  White has a weak group.  You should be thinking about how to attack it in a way that you expand your upper side framework while attacking.]
;W[fk]
(;B[ke]C[Too slow.  White is building a big framework on the left side. This move adds very little to your framework.  When two frameworks are adjacent like this, the key points are along the boundary between them.]
;W[nj];B[rp]C[This is a mistake I think.

See variation...

Yes, a mistake.  The same general rule: one point jump for defense, knight move for offense.  Here the white group is strong so you are not attacking.  You are making life in the corner, so think first about the one point jump.]

(;W[qp];B[qq];W[ro];B[rq]LB[fh:A]C[The white grop is already alive.  You are alive if you don't answer, so this is just endgame.   The area around A is bigger.]
;W[hc]LB[ke:A][gb:B]C[you played A to make your upper side stronger so that invasions would fail.  If you let white invade and live here, A did not serve its purpose.

I would answer at B and fight (with A in place).]
(;B[hd];W[fb];B[ic];W[gc];B[fd];W[ib];B[jb];W[hb]LB[ke:A]C[Now A is clearly a wasted move.]
;B[fg]C[I would prefer one point to the left.];W[ci]C[Slow white move.]

(;B[dj]C[You could also think about making territory in the center while attacking the lower side white group and forcing it to connect to the left.]

(;B[rj]LB[pi:A]C[yuor potential territory in the center is more important than the edge, so I would play at A.]

(;B[oq]LB[or:A]C[A is better - white can't block with sente.]
