AB[pd][dp][pp]C[utku: Hello. My name is Utku Ã?zÃ¼lmez. I am around 13k in KGS. If you would like to review my game, please let me know about my general mistakes. I added some variations that I thought after the game.

Thank you very much!
---------------------------

RickMott: Hi, Utku.  I think the most general class of mistake here is to focus too much on attacking and not enough on shoring up your own weaknesses first.  Also, there are lots of minor tactical reading errors.  I have tried to walk though a few sequences to show how you could have gotten a better result, in some cases by sacrificing a small group for a larger gain elsewhere.  Also, you had a big ko in the lower right, but you threw away a great many good ko threats before starting it.  For example, if you'd started the ko before the big center group had life, you might have gotten a great deal more.

Good luck in future games!];W[dd];B[cf];W[ch];B[ef]C[RickMott: Usually, in response to a tight pincer, I think it is better to dive into the corner at 3-3.
You may sacrifice the C14 stone, but you should get an even position.  Just running is a
little defensive.];W[fd];B[di];W[ci];B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[cl]
;B[em]C[RickMott: Once white is alive on both sides, I would consider connecting the stones with D12 instead.
This leaes the possibility of complicated fighting, and you're the one taking the handicap. :)]
;W[dh]C[RickMott: Now you can't prevent white from cutting you apart somewhere.]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[eg]C[RickMott: This makes a good center-facing wall, but at the cost of giving white a huge upper left corner and side.
I would be strongly tempted to play C15 instead.   You threaten either to make life in the corner, or to connect out
and separate white with a bamboo joint.];W[df];B[ee];W[ed]C[RickMott: The result of this sequence is favorable to white.  His F16 stone is out in front of your wall, and he's got
nearly 35 points of solid territory in the corner.];B[ck];W[bk]

(;B[bl]C[RickMott: The outside cut doesn't work, so the whole push-cut sequence shouldn't be played. 
Either make a big play on the bottom or right sides, or do something with the trapped C14 stone.

You could, for example, play C15 in sente (if white doesn't block, you connect.  Now you can
play B17 and live in the corner.  See variation.];W[bm];B[bj]
;W[al];B[jc]C[RickMott: Where is your biggest potential?   It could be here, if white didn't have F16 poking out, but a move
around K3 or K4 looks more powerful, considering the D4-E7 stones and the wall above.  White should invade
the bottom now.];W[nq];B[qn]C[RickMott: Too tight, I think.  I would be inclined to play on a larger scale at Q10 to make a bigger framework.
Don't worry about a double approach; if white does that, separate with P5.]
;W[jp];B[lp]C[RickMott: I still like making a double wing with Q10, or making an extension at G3 or H3.  Starting a fight here is not
good in a handicap game.  You should let white live wherever he wants to, but try to force him to live small while
using your extra stones to build large-scale moyos.];W[lq];B[kp]
;W[kq];B[mp];W[np];B[no];W[oo];B[nn];W[op];B[qp]C[RickMott: Extend down at Q3 to make a bigger corner.]
;W[pr]C[RickMott: White couldn't do this if you had taken Q3 instead of R4.  The difference is only a few points, but a few points
here and there add up over the course of a game.];B[qr];W[pq]
;B[on]C[RickMott: Locally, this is bad because you give up 6 points in the corner when white cuts at R3.
However, globally this may be a good idea to strengthen the right side.]
;W[pi]C[RickMott: White must invade or you will get a huge moyo.]
;B[pg]C[RickMott: I would be inclined to play this on the 3rd line at R13 instead.  You want to make it hard for white to make a
base on the side, and drive him to run out while making territory on top.  This move allows white to play a contact
move underneath at R13 and start a fight.];W[pl]C[RickMott: Now you have to read a bit.   White has forcing moves starting with the push to Q5, but they don't hurt you.
You should either attack white's base and support your corner stones with S8, or expand your upper right moyo
with K15.  See variation.  I have tried to analyze this out quite a long way, because the strategic decisions at this
point in the middle game are critical to the result.]
(;B[po]C[RickMott: Safety is good if you can't read it out, but you could win the fight if White played here.  See variations.]
;W[pm];B[mq]C[RickMott: This is good, you can separate white.  But your weakness in the corner may be a problem.]
;W[mr];B[nr];W[oq];B[lr]C[RickMott: Very good for you.];W[qq]

(;B[rq]C[RickMott: This looks obvious, but the cutting points it leaves allow white to live.  You can kill white by descending to S4 instead.
See variations.  I analyzed this in a lot of detail.  I hope it's correct... :)]
;W[rr];B[sr];W[qs];B[rp]C[RickMott: This is the key weakness which lets white get a second eye.]
;W[or];B[ms];W[os]
(;B[pn]C[RickMott: This connection is not necessary.  You can always make life with the slide at S8 if white cuts here.]
;W[lc]C[RickMott: Any time you want, you can start a 30-point two-stage ko for the life of white's bottom right group with S1.  That's a lot of aji.]
;B[kd]C[RickMott: Leaning on this stone will just make it stronger.  I would extend on the other side to G17, threatening to slide into white's corner.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[le];B[he]C[RickMott: Ok, this isn't too bad, but you're letting the situation get very complicated.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg]C[RickMott: This sequence should be bad for white.  The corner stones aren't alive, and his 3 stone group is now facing a strong black wall.]
;W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]C[RickMott: Normally it's better to make the tiger's mouth connection at O17.]
;W[oe]
(;B[pe]C[RickMott: Much better to protect the cut indirectly with P14.  See variation.  Your primary goal here is to keep white from connecting his groups while not getting enclosed yourself.  If you succeed, it's hard to see how they can both live.]
;W[lh];B[nh]C[RickMott: Right idea, but maybe not strongly enough connected to your own unsettled group.  O13 does the job, and threatens a clamp at O15 and a cut at M13.   This knight's move lets white try some sacrifice cuts.]
;W[qh];B[oj]C[RickMott: I don't know what' you're thinking here, but you must connect at R13.  It's terrible to let white connect his weak side stones to a live corner; now your group is under attack.]
;W[pj];B[ok];W[qg]C[RickMott: You have sort-of completed a giant center moyo, but you've let white save a perfectly attackable right side group and now your own thin group in the top right is not safe.  White may win the fight, or at least make his own group live while you make life, and ruin your moyo.  You would have had an easy game if you'd just kept white separated.  IMO, allowing white to cut at R13 has just tipped the balance of the game in his favor.]
;B[nf]C[RickMott: I like this move.]
(;W[of]C[RickMott: I think this is a mistake by white.  He should attempt to connect at O15.]

(;B[og]C[RickMott: ouch.  This is a tactical error.  You must keep white from attempting to connect with O15.  See variation.]
;W[ne];B[pf]C[RickMott: Better to play N14 and if white cuts, follow the sacrifice line in the variation from move 94.]
;W[mf];B[mg];W[lg]C[RickMott:  This is not good.  White is connected out, and you are locked in a complicated fight with a stronger player.]
;B[mh]C[RickMott: What does this move do for you?  It's still a ko.  I think it's time to cut at K3 and at least try to take some territory on the bottom.]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[mj];B[pk]C[RickMott: This is a distraction; the main focus has to be the attack on white's center group.   Maybe a peep at L14, followed by another at L11.]
;W[qk];B[ql]C[RickMott: Good moves locally.];W[rk];B[rl];W[kj]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[ll]C[RickMott: Not the biggest move.  Taking white's eye with L11 is still good.  Seems like a cut at K3 is really important.  G17 is much bigger, too.]
;W[ml];B[nl];W[mm];B[mk]C[RIckMott: Push instead at M9; you still threaten to cut white and you don't leave as many cutting points.  Then follow up with L11 to take an eye away while still leaving room to run.]
;W[lk];B[nk];W[kl];B[lm];W[km];B[ln]C[RickMott: By sacrificing two stones, a mere four points, white has made his group safe and greatly reduced your moyo's potential.  Black is behind now.]
;W[gf]C[RickMott: but this is an overplay by white.  He should not play so close to your strength.]
;B[ge];W[fe];B[ff];W[gg];B[jh]C[RickMott: Good.  G14 was an overplay by white; he shouldn't get away with it.]
;W[hi]
(;B[ij]C[RickMott: I think you can do better here.  How about taking white's eye at L11 now?  I think he has to connect, and you can make a tiger's mouth at K10 to make another false eye.  See variation.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[jj];B[ik];W[gk];B[hl]C[RickMott: Going for the large-scale capture, which is right.]
;W[gl];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn]C[RickMott: This hane might be too soon.  I'd be more comfortable extending to H6.  He's still not getting any eye space.]
;W[hn]C[RickMott: See?  The cutting point is getting you in trouble already.]
;B[in];W[fn];B[ho];W[fm];B[en];W[fo]
(;B[gi]C[utku: I am not sure about this. There should be more good one. I wanted to destroy my opponents eye space.

RickMott: I think you need to worry a bit about your own cutting points.   White can play E8 now and separate you.  Suddenly the hunter and hunted are reversed.  So I think you should play E8 first.  White will still have a lot of trouble making eyes.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[fj];B[ei];W[dl]C[RickMott: Ouch.  Now he can separate you and attack your lower-left stones.]
;B[el];W[ek];B[fh]C[RIckMott: Good move, if you miss this you may die.  You must capture some stones to live now.]
;W[eq];B[dq]
(;W[er]C[RickMott: White missed a play here.  If he plays E5, I don't think you can save the three stones.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[gp];W[fp]
(;B[go]C[RickMott: This move is a mistake.  It doesn't matter if white pushes here; you connect at H4.  The critical move is to connect your stones in the bottom left with E5.  See variation.]
;W[bp]C[utku: Is there a way to be alive?


RickMott: Locally, maybe you can fight a ko for life in the corner starting with B3.  But I agree with your variation, L11 is the best move now.]

(;B[cp]C[RickMott: making an empty triangle can't be good.]

;B[do]C[RickMott: Way too late.  No chance to capture white before he captures you.  He can just make life in the corner.]
;W[dr];B[bo]C[RickMott: White can ignore this move to take a big play elsewhere, like G18.  You can't make 2 eyes.]

;W[fb]
(;B[cc]C[utku: Is there a way to live in corner?

RickMott: No, your best play is probably push at D15.  See variations.

Also, you have the big double ko for white's group in the lower right to work with.  That might be enough.  wait a few moves...]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce]
(;B[dc]C[RickMott: This doesn't work; white can slide underneath you.  Consider D18.  See variations.]
;W[da]C[RickMott: You can start the bottom-right ko here.  You'll get several threats out of this corner.  Another threat at F3, and another at S12.   You should get something out this.]
;B[ba];W[ab];B[db];W[eb];B[ca];W[bb];B[fq]C[RickMott: Only endgame moves remaining; black cannot make up the big losses on the left.  Black has only one chance to win, and that is to start the two-step ko for life in white's lower right corner.  You should actually have done this earlier, before the fight in the upper left was settled; then you would have a chance either to make life or kill in the lower right.  This move then becomes a ko threat, too.]

Still, White has come off well in this sequence.  You have very little territory except the upper right (the lower left will not be big because white has groups on both sides), and white has a big upper left and smaller territories at the bottom and right side.  In this line, the most important area of the board now is the upper left.  If white connects at D15, you have no aji left.  So you must play either C15-C17 to make life, or D15-C16 push and cut to fight in the corner and attack white's 3 stones at the top.  I'm not good enough to read out which is better.]

It's hard to foresee the fighting from here, but I think white gains more outside than he loses in the corner.  I wanted to show
you this to demonstrate that really big sacrifices shouldn't be overlooked if you get enough power in return  And the threat of the
push at N3 is still there, so the bottom right isn't as big as it looks for white without another move (giving you sente to strengthen
your moyo yet again).])))
