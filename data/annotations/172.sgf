[1995-05-01]TM[1800]KM[0.5];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[cd];B[ep];W[dq];B[eq]M[eq][ep]C[White's most pressing need is to finish off the lower  left corner, not make an enclosure in the upper left.  white D6 puts pressure  on the two marked black stones so that black must take care of them before  doing anything else.]

(;W[fc]
(;B[po]C[Instead of black  at Q5, I'd prefer to finish off the lower left  (since white didn't).  That way, black is in a good position to pressure  the  two white stones with  a move like D6.]
;W[qf];B[qh]
(;W[qd]C[Standard moves for white would be R17 (3-3 invasion)  or P14 (one space jump).]
;B[qc];W[pe];B[rd];W[qe]M[pe][qd][qe][qf]C[These four marked white stones produce a horrible shape  for white.   Heavy, no eyes--they are a target waiting for black to attack.]
;B[od];W[og];B[pj]M[cd][fc]
(;W[dh]C[D12 is to close to the marked white stones to be efficient.   If white wants to extend, he's got to think big!!!    As an aside, think how nice an extension to D10 would be for white if there  were a white stone at D6.]
;B[cj];W[dm];B[ej];W[ck]C[THE  STRONGEST ATTACKING MOVES DO NOT MAKE CONTACT WITH THE  STONES THEY ARE ATTACKING.    Remember that piece of advice, it will serve you well.    Generally, what happens is that the stones you touch are strengthened and  your attack falters.]

(;W[do]M[cm][dm][cp]C[D5 is a strange move as  the marked stones are already  connected.  You can't waste moves like this and expect to win.]
;B[em];W[eo];B[gp]C[If white  wants to invade, L3 is a better choice.  Consider the followup!]

(;W[ip];B[kp]M[po][pq]C[L4 is perfect for black.  Attacks white and  builds territory with the two marked black  stones.]
;W[go];B[hp];W[ho];B[iq];W[in];B[jq]M[ej][dk][dl][em][cl][cj]C[Black  is  connected with sure territory on the bottom and right.  Black needs to worry  about marked stones now because white has built up some strength.]
;W[er];B[fr];W[dr];B[df]C[D14 is too  aggressive and not really needed  since black is ahead anyway.]

;B[ge]
(;W[fd]C[Why make  tight connection?  More efficient to block at  F15 since that's where black wants to get to.]
