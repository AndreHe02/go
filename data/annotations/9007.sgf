C[For this review, I tried to answer the questions the best I could, but they were sometimes difficult to understand. I removed some comments and variations that I could not make sense of at all.

how should I answer this move ?

white connects on the second line, but black will be thick outside...

(;W[jb]C[White is not gote because black must defend, which she did in the ga,e. So white has sente, and black suffers from bad shape. I do not think this position is bad for white, so he shouldn't play to avoid it.

white is 'gote', and black will develop a huge influence !
what was white's mistake ? how should he play to avoid that ???
(LL)];B[ff]LB[kd:B][he:A]C[Black has weak points that white can exploit by playing A or B. Black can not keep white from breaking out into the center.]

white plays on the fourth line to limit black's center 'moyo'.

now black's center is becoming to be quite big !

I do not understand the reasoning behind Q5 very well, so it could very well be the better move for all I know. A does appear to be much more common in proffessional play though, so I would still go with that move.

white tries to fight for the center...
