C[Hal: I didn't review this game as soon as I usually do, so I may have trouble remembering what I was thinking during the game.

All first person comments are my thoughts at the time. All third person comments are my analysis of the game made during my own review.

E: Hello. My comments starts with this letter.];B[pd];W[dd]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[jq]C[E:];W[dm];B[pi]C[E: Looks a bit odd. Q9 would be high chinese opening.
Now it that becomes clear that you play fot influence, K3 seems questionable.]
;W[jd];B[md]C[E: Seems slow to me.
I woul play R5 making shimari or around K10 to build framework.]
;W[dh];B[qm];W[pg];B[ng];W[pe]
(;B[qf]C[Hal: Here I forgot that I was playing for influence in that area.]
;W[pf];B[qe];W[qg];B[qh]C[E: Why not R11? Contact play here strenhens both sides. B is already strong and have no need in strenghening W.]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[rg];B[re]C[E: This is a bad shape and leaves weakness around P16.
R16 would be better.];W[ph];B[qi];W[oi];B[oh];W[oj]
(;B[pj]C[E: I would prefer R9.];W[ok];B[ni];W[nj];B[mi];W[mj]
;B[lj];W[lk]
(;B[mk]C[E: Overly agrresive. If you wnat to fight double hane at L9 would be better.]

;W[kg];B[ki];W[lg];B[mf]C[E: Mistake. If W continues with throw-in at O12...]

(;B[em]C[E: not necessary.
E2 or L17 looks way better.
It is "large-scale endgame" now.
Another good ideas would to look at corners. Upper left W's and lower right yours.]
;W[ck];B[kf]C[E: Strang move.
Top, BL or BR conrner are prefferable.];W[je];B[kd];W[jc];B[jb]
;W[ib];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[ja];B[ka]C[Hal: This move was suicide.
E: This move is autoatari whic seems to be haunting you.
I would play M19 ot N18.];W[jb]C[Hal: This was a bad response by White.]
(;B[le]C[E: localy L15 is better, and M19 is urgent.];W[cc]
;B[er];W[dr]
(;B[ep]C[Hal: This move is bad shape];W[qq];B[qp];W[rq]
(;B[qr]C[Hal: I was trying to kill here when I should have been trying to minimize damage.]
;W[rp];B[ro]TR[qo][pp][pr]C[E: way too insecure. Youhave three cutting points now.]
;W[pp];B[qo];W[oq]
(;B[op]C[E: way too dangerous. If W takes stone and connects you are in big trouble.
See variation.];W[pr];B[po]
(;W[np];B[pq];W[or];B[rr];W[pp];B[gh]C[Hal: This was my attempt at a ko threat.]
;W[oo];B[ei]C[Hal: I felt I had to follow through with the threat to avoid it becoming a wasted move.

E: You should check whether threat is effective. Otherwise it might make two wasted moves instead of one.
In actual game it led to trade with zero points profit for both sides.]
;W[fh];B[no];W[di];B[on];W[nn];B[op];W[mo];B[pq];W[oo]C[E: Connecting here is more solid and stiil catches three W in corner.]
(;B[sq]C[E: you should simply connect at Q4.];W[pp];B[mm];W[mn]

(;B[op]C[E: taking this stones doesn't achieve anything besides one point.
I woul be better to portect at O7 or block W with L2.];W[pn]

E: Yes, atari should be from the other side.];W[es];B[gr];W[gs]

;W[cf]
(;B[mg]C[Hal: This was just intended as a forcing move, but White seems to have missed the atari, so I got some free points. On the other haand, I should have played a more urgent point.]

[ak][bk][dk][al][bl]C[E: Summary.
Aside from common go proverbs like "connect you groupd, cut opponents's one" there are more specific points.
Don't capture stones, especially single ones, simply when you can. See whether stones make some groups connected or makes your group cutten.
Keep an eye for open borders espcially at the mid-end of the game, when they become biggest points left.
Good luck.])
