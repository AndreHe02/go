AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[(magob): Hi, I'm playing white here. Both me and black are very interested in comments on this game. We both feel that the opening is our weakest part and will appreciate any hints on how to improve our game there. I have inserted comments and questions concerning my thoughts throughout the game.]
;W[nc];B[pf]
(;W[jd]C[Usually it' s better to play this move after f17. With a black stone in d16 I think tha k16 is slow]

(;B[cj]C[I don't like this move but I'm not so strong to say it 's wrong, 
 I prefer  g17 or sanrensei in k4];W[fc];B[ec];W[fq];B[lq]C[wrong! black f16 now is a very important move, m3 is useless (it'snt a pincer for f3 so white can make tennuki)]
;W[jq]LB[hq:A]C[possible....usually it's better play j3 (k3 is lighter) because of   black a (future threat)]
;B[qk]C[(magob): I feel that this looks good for black, even better than the four handicap stones should give.

You have to play an important move at f16, after this I think you are still in the game (if your opponent is really four stones weaker than you)

F16 is an important direction of play, imagine the difference if this move would be played by black]

(;W[fo]C[(magob): This was played to make my group more stable and to prepare for an attack on the m3 stone. Is it better to play d2 here to get stability?

I don't think so, f5 is good but I prefer the double approach in c6]
;B[dn];W[nq];B[mp];W[np];B[pn];W[pq]C[(magob): Should I jump out instead to keep pressure on m3-n4?

jumping out you keep pressure to these stones..you should jump out ...remember that in handicap game game white have to find a way to keep opponent group separated and than make influence. At the end try to convert this influence in territory.]
;B[ln]C[(magob): Gives white easy life in the corner, I feel r3 would have been better for black.

Yes m6 is a mistake];W[qp];B[qo];W[op];B[po];W[rp];B[ro]C[little]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[cr]C[little];B[oc]C[right];W[nd];B[do]LB[fd:A]
[nn:B]C[(magob): a bit slow maybe? I was expecting o6 or somthing thereabout to connect and seal white in. Other possibilities would be d13 or o14.

d5 is an heavy useless move (one of the worse)

better a or b];W[cf]C[(magob): Is it better to play o14 instead, to prevent black from building a large moyo on the right side?


I think that f16 it's better  because black now can play it (not good foor white)

o14 not wrong but I think it's little for now]
(;B[cd]C[too submissive];W[ch]C[no! now white f16 ia a must

C12 is very slow, you risk to be killed or run without a base]
;B[nf]
(;W[me]C[not good....o6 or d10  better];B[mf];W[nn]C[(magob): I felt that I need to get into the moyo before it's too late.
yes];B[ol];W[nl];B[mm];W[nm];B[mo];W[on];B[ok];W[pm]C[(magob): a misstake, should have continued with o9, or maybe k5.

yes, too early for this];B[om];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl];B[rn];W[ql]
;B[rk];W[sl];B[sk];W[pk]C[useless, o9 before and wait your opponent answer]
;B[pj];W[nk];B[nj];W[lk]C[(magob): better with k5?

no, this is good, you try to put your opponent in the right direction, but maybe you should play n10 instead of m9]
;B[jm];W[fm];B[il];W[cl]C[(magob): attacking c10 and the d5 group simultaneously.

yes good, black had to play e10 before];B[cm];W[dl];B[jj];W[mj]
;B[kf];W[je];B[le];W[ld];B[kh];W[ni]C[(magob): A wasted move seen in retrospect. b2, j5 or e18 is maybe better?

not wasted is sente];B[oj];W[fg];B[hq]C[(magob): I was expecting this, don't know why I did not cover up with j5 earlier.]

(;W[ip]C[(magob): Is this my best defence?

difficult to read the whole sequence but I think of yes or

better a good tenuki at b8 attacking in sente the black group]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ho];W[in];B[hn]C[black is pushing from behind...not good]
;W[im];B[hm];W[hl]
(;B[gl]C[see variation];W[jl];B[hk]C[painful fight];W[km];B[kr]
C[useless ....this move give point to white and remove ko threat]
;W[jr];B[js]C[this too];W[is];B[ks]C[this too];W[ir];B[mr]C[this too]
;W[nr];B[br];W[bo];B[bm];W[bl];B[bp];W[dm];B[bn];W[ej]C[(magob): My stones at c2-d2, f3, f5, f7 and the d8 group are too weak to stay connected. I'm taking a chance here that black won't attack the bottom directly.]
;B[hr]C[(magob): Unfortunately, he attacks though. Now, I think black should be able to capture at least the c2-d2 stones, and possibly even the f3 stone.

less for black];W[eq]C[(magob): threatening to connect upward with e6.]
;B[kp];W[kn];B[kl]
(;W[jk]C[wrong see variation];B[kk];W[jn];B[kj];W[lm];B[ll]
;W[mn];B[ml];W[lo];B[mk]C[(magob): Here I was happy to keep the m3 group captured, but unhappy that I had to sacrifice m9, n10 and o11. Could I have done differently?

 move 110];W[eb]C[(magob): Turning to the only open part of the board, even though the stones at the bottom left are still in danger. I felt that since I am behind, I need to play the upper left first.]
;B[db];W[ed];B[dc];W[fd];B[en];W[gr];B[fn]C[(magob): black is to kind, should have cut me off with h1 first to capture many white stones.
yes];W[hs];B[ek]C[good]
(;W[dk]C[bad];B[dj];W[bj]C[dubious now];B[ob];W[nb];B[ig];W[be]
;B[bd];W[df];B[ea];W[fb];B[fa];W[ga];B[da];W[gb];B[ei]C[(magob): nice move by black, saving his two stones at c10-d10.]

(;W[ac]C[(magob): Better to attack with a17? During the game I felt I should be able to get seki here, but the outsife liberties turned out to foil my plans.

too much outside liberty to kill or try a ko
