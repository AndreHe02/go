C[fiderblool [11k\]: hello
Kibagami [11k\]: hello
Kibagami [11k\]: have fun
fiderblool [11k\]: yes, enjoy the game

<tom> thank you for the chance to review this game.
in the next move are comments and an index.];B[pd]C[( to see the move in CGoban, hold shift and click the spot )

>>> How white can setup for more center territory:
5. e4 when black has a couple stones in the corner, prevent black from extending

>>> How white can keep the upper left more alive:
try playing slow and boring, complicated games seem random and prone to chance.  
12. b10 when white pushed against black, white got life,
however white force black to get strong and take the upper left corner.
21. b16 cut first, ask questions later
35. d16 when whites stones are in danger, sacrifice them with forcing moves

>>> General advice:
101. b2 capture corner using throw in
125. o6 cut off the black escape

try selecting some stones to die, 
and use forcing moves to make their sacrifice worth while.

try playing in open spaces, where a single stone can make more difference.

allow your oppenent to attack you, defenders usually win, and can pick
what side effects the battle will have.

Learning by trial and error is fun, to see what works.  Unfortunately the trial and error lessons learned against 10k or 11k don't work so well against 2k or 3k.  Consider playing a more boring style, building up territory, then attack from those living groups.]
;W[pp]C[I purposefully allowed the cross-fuseki, I've never played white against a cross-fuseki and wanted to experiment.]
;B[cp]LB[dc:c][cd:e][dd:d][ep:a][eq:b]C[I considered A B C D and E.
A and B didn't look very nice if he then played D.
Playing D myself seemed hesitant, if he followed with a corner enclosure at B I wasn't sure how I would follow that up.
C seemed like the wrong direction of play.  So I played E.  Was this correct?

<tom> just relax and try out some moves, this will help you find which ones fit your style.  I'll comment on each letter, and how it fits with my style.

A : black can ignore and move at d16, seems like being the first in the corner is better than approaching a low corner stone.
seems to work well with Q4, if white immediately fills in the lower k3 gap]
(;W[cd];B[ep]LB[cj:B][gq:A]C[black has two corner stones stacked up.  traditionally they would next extend out to B, what can white do?

A: game move extends from G3, threatening to go under e2 or extend back to k3, or extend out to g5

B: suggested move prevents black from working well with his two black stones.]
(;W[gq];B[dj];W[ck]LB[cn:a]C[I played the shoulder hit as a forcing move so I could get my base in at A.  But I attacked from inside his territory, was this wrong in this situation?

<tom> seems like attacking directly a bit early.  black has the e4 wall to use on one side, while d10 and another stone will squeeze c9 to live small, while black will build up influence to the center.]
;B[cf];W[ch]LB[cf:9][ck:8]C[I figured he could run into the middle and allow me to connect 8 and 10, or he could play where he did and allow me to pressure 9]
;B[cj];W[bj]LB[nd:3][de:2][di:1]SQ[cj][dj][cp][ep]C[But then I changed my mind and decided I wanted to live inside his influence...
I did not know what the best way was to play here, so I tried to play every way.

<tom> it is fun to explore and try things out.
in this case you did well to get the c9 stones to live.
looks like white leaned into c10 while getting life.
this is good for c9 to live, however it has a side effect.

The side effect of getting C9 to live inside of what was originally black's space
is that black had a very solid structure directly in contact with c12
black also has c14 for support.
White will need to build up defences for c16

Here is the general squence that appears in my mind:
1. b10 and c10 fight, b10 lives next to c4, while black gets a dragon,
but the eyeless dragon quickly gets eyes thanks to c14

2. black's dragon at c10 now pushes against c16, reducing the corner,
and building up influence

3. now that black has formed a bunch of stones and influence around f16 and d10
black now works with Q16 to get some moyo going

White has life in the corner around c17, White has life under c4 and c10
Black has strong influence around f16 and q16];B[bi];W[aj];B[ai]
;W[bl];B[ci];W[bf]LB[df:a]C[Should this have been on top?

<tom> yeah, I think that would be a good change

black has invested many stones around C11, black is very strong here. 
white cannot win a battle against such a strong wall.
with such a large board white may want to seek other areas]
;B[be];W[bg];B[bd]LB[ce:B][df:A]C[<tom> cut first, ask questions later :)

What would be best?

<tom> the board is completely played out in the upper left
in the opposite corner there is only one stone.
maybe you prefer playing 13x13 games? :)

I would go with C

A : build up some territory below, put some pressure on c4, preparing for c6
B : feels the same as A
C : get some wide open space, put some pressure on R14
low to avoid attack from r14, feels more commited to edge, less to center
feels like it is working with M16 stuff
D : wide open space, keep option of going in center or build up edge]

;W[gi]C[How could I have set myself up for more territory in the middle?

the side effects of your fights have pushed black into the center.

by sacrificing the stones at c16 you can have more stones in the center.
by pushing into r14 earlier you can have a stone around p13 or p14
by cutting off n6 stones you avoid k7
by killing c4 the stones at e4 are under pressure, you can attack around g7, push black to connect with e12 and jump to center
by moving around r11  rather than d9 you can pressure q16 and then jump to p11

early in the game, each move can threaten two things, the opponent may respond to defend the larger threat, then you can move into the smaller threat.
- move around r11 to threaten q16 = they defend the corner, now you can move into p11
- move around e16, threaten capture of d16, they defend, now you can d17 and g17

try more threats where you have two good next moves, the other guy cannot defend against both.]
