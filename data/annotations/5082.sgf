C[I had the opportunity to play a much stronger payer in a simul game, but he wasn't able to stick around for the review.  It would be awsome if you could just give a general review of whatever aspects of this game stand out.  Other than a few reading errors or mistakes, I noticed that I wasn't handling sente very well, and perhaps direction of play and timing was poor.  Also, I tegen, so advice on how to play with influence properly would be much appreciated.



Thanks,  George



M:  Hi, George.  Very interesting game!  

M:  I think the largest issue in this game was the lack of a coherent strategy.  You need to develop a plan and stick with it.  By playing tengen, you are looking for a fighting game.  You want to force white to play a little cautiously, since your influence in the center will be an advantage in every fight.  You'll have to eschew territory in the beginning in favor of boxing white into corners.  You'll need to play solidly, so you'll have no weak groups for white to exploit in the later fighting.  If you succeed, white will have the corners, but you'll have the sides and control of at least part of the center.  

M:  With that in mind, I think this game was lost in two places.  First, black took a small amount of  territory on the bottom right rather than boxing white in.  This reduced the potential center territory greatly.  Second, black made a rash invasion on the top right and overextended on the top.  This created two weak groups that white used to break into the center.]
;B[jj];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[pj]C[M:  I would probably play in  the last empty corner at this point.  ("Corners, side, center.")  I'm not especially familiar with tengen openings, however.]
;W[pq];B[od]C[M:  Good!  Separate the white stones.];W[oc];B[nc]
;W[pc]LB[md:A]C[M:  I prefer "A," as white has little to gain from a peep, and you may extend further.]

(;B[nd];W[qf]LB[fc:B][jc:A]C[M:  "A" is the normal point and seems to work fine.  Otherwise, you have given white solid corner territory and an expansion toward your wedge stone for very little.  

M:  "B" is interesting, too.  It seeks to use your tengen stone.  If white pincers. black jumps out.]

(;B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[op]LB[pm:A][nn:C][qq:B]C[M:  "A," "B," and "C" are the normal continuations.   I rather like B.]

(;B[qo]C[M:  You wanted an influence based game, but this move is very territorial.  It seeks to get a few points with Q10.  Unfortunately, white gets out, ruining black's center influence, and black doesn't get many points on the side because of R14.]
;W[nn];B[om];W[nm];B[nl];W[gc]LB[dj:A]
(;B[ic]LB[jc:A][dj:B]C[M:  This is loose.  "A" is the normal extension, and black doesn't gain much by being one line closer to the white formation.  

M:  This is a difficult point.  I prefer "B" to this move, because if white takes it, I don't see where black gets territory.  Because of R14, the top right isn't worth much.  White can respond by playing "A," but I think black has plenty of room to run.]
;W[cn];B[kp];W[rp];B[mp]LB[cj:A][cl:B]C[M:  You didn't need to play this move yet.  Keep it for later.  It just makes white stronger for little profit.  How about a pincer, instead?  It's the best way to use your influence.]
;W[mo];B[gq];W[dj]
(;B[dg]LB[cl:A]C[M:  Personally, I dislike this move, because it is passive.  You are reducing your opponent's structure without building up your own.  Maybe "A?"

M:  Before you make a move, you must ask, "What is my goal?"  Then, you should be able to read a sequence that results that achieves that goal.  What is your goal here?  What is your sequence?]
;W[ce]LB[fc:A][cd:B]C[M:  I believe the corner is still open.  This is the proper move if G17 were one line closer, at A.  In this case, I rather like B.]
;B[ee]LB[cl:A]C[I spent a good amount of time deciding where to play here, and this is what I came up with, but I'm still not sure what would have been best.  Would the ikken tobi to f13 be best, or is this okay?

M:  This solidifies white's corner territory.  If you want to extract D13, then yes, F13 is better.  I would leave D13 alone, though, and play A.  You can try to isolate D10, and white will have trouble taking D13.]
;W[ed];B[ci]C[M:  This is another "thank you move."  White is happy.]
;W[cj]C[M:  White is solid on both sides.];B[fi]TR[ee][dg][ci]
C[M:  The situation was not good before, but this was clearly the losing sequence.  White is secure on both sides, and black ended in gote (and with bad shape).]

[ar][br][kr][ks]C[I could tell that the cut would work  but is it worth it?  The other move considered was a simple l15 to try to secure some easy territory.

M:  Count to find out.  I count white with 55 solid points.  Black with just under 45 points and potential for more in the center.  That suggests you should be aggressive.  

M:  That being said, you have quite a few weak groups.  White can atttack the top or the left side.  Your objective isn't to kill J14.  It's to solidify your groups and make territory.]
;W[hf];B[gf];W[gg];B[ff];W[jd];B[jc];W[hi]LB[gi:A][gj:B]C[M:  Black's weak left group is difficult to handle.  How about "A" or "B?"]
;B[ej];W[kd];B[kc];W[ld];B[lc]C[M:  Black has no potential for making territory in the top right center, now.]
;W[ek];B[fk];W[kh];B[pg]LB[ng:B][qh:C][kn:A]C[M:  How about shifting gears and building up the bottom (A)?  Or strengthening the top or side (B or C), instead?]
;W[ep]C[M:  This seems like an overplay to me.]

;W[fp];B[fq];W[qg];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri]C[M:  If you're going to attack the white center group, you have to do it now.  I can't read a way to kill it, though, so I think the best you can do is force it to make life (while making some points of your own in the center).]

;B[kg];W[jg];B[ke]C[L13 must be poor.  Would a move around o3 be more significant?

M:  H5 seems pretty important now.]
(;W[je];B[le]C[M:  If you were going to play this, why not take the ko at K14 first?  It at least costs black a threat.]
;W[mq];B[lq];W[mr];B[lr];W[bp];B[bq];W[bo]LB[ih:A]C[M:  "A" is the key point for life.  I can't read a kill, still, so you should push from the outside to force him to play A (while you make territory).]
;B[mh];W[mi];B[nh];W[lj];B[ll]LB[jl:A][kl:B]C[M:  Just jump straight out to A or B.  The knight's move can be cut.]
;W[kl]LB[ih:A]C[M:  White is being a tad too aggressive, I think.  Until he plays A, his center group isn't alive.]

Mostly just yose left.  I would be happy for any additional comments, advice.
