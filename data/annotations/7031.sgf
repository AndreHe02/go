C[Dear reviewer,

Thanks in advance for looking at this game.
We played it recently at the 2nd Japanese Generalkonsul tournament in Duesseldorf.
I played white in this game. I felt good during the opening and the middle game. But somehow black used his thickness effectively and managed to take the lead. Where did I go wrong?
The last 30 moves I tried to memorize but there maybe some errors in the order.

Dear Peter,

You played well throughout the game. I saw very few big mistakes. The only problem I noticed was that you overlooked some variations which would have made the game in your favor.]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pq];B[po]
(;W[np]LB[qo:A][de:B]C[This is always a possibility, depending on your style, but it seems too peaceful. It lets Black make shape very easily.

I personally like attaching with A or playing aggressively with B.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or];B[qk];W[ce]LB[qi:A][qf:B]C[A is certainly a possibility. A Black extension somewhere near B would help his weak group. And the easiest way to play a good game is to keep attacking your opponent's groups.]
;B[dh]LB[qi:A]C[A would be good now too.];W[ee];B[fd];W[cc]
;B[cb];W[dd]LB[bc:A]C[This is a mistake - it must be at A]
(;B[bc];W[ec];B[cd];W[db];B[cc];W[ed];B[qf]C[This is a very large move for Black because it is hard for White to attack Black 25 satisfactorily.]

(;W[mc]SQ[qf]LB[nd:A][qh:B]C[This develops the top more quickly than a play at A, but here attacking Black's stone is far more important. At the least, White must play at A to leave a good follow-up (at B perhaps).]
;B[of];W[fq]C[This is ok, but I would rather approach Black's stone from the other side, to try to weaken D12.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[gr];B[go];W[cq]
LB[hp:A]C[I thought, the corner is bigger than the influence.

I agree with you. Even if you extended at A, White would still need to play another move to make the bottom definite territory.]
;B[hp];W[gq];B[io];W[ok];B[pk]LB[om:A][qm:B]C[I regarded P9 as a forcing move and I wanted to know where to extend.

I would personally like to jump back with the ikken tobi of A first. It shows a desire to invade at B and gives White 42 a few options to safety.]
;W[re]LB[oc:A]C[This is not very good as it leaves the weakness at A open.]

(;B[eb];W[fb];B[da];W[fc];B[df]
(;W[de]C[I thought about E14 but I didn't see any advantages and allowing the cut seemed too big.

I think connecting is necessary, but E14 is necessary first, as a forcing move to protect your top group.]
;B[gg]
(;W[co]LB[he:A]C[I thought the beginning moyo which he can force with a move around G16will get small if I play there. Perhaps taking territory with G15 would have been better?

It's hard to find a good move here, but White must respond to Black 51. I think A for White would be better than G15, which is too narrow.]
;B[hd]C[At this point, White's group has bad shape and will have great trouble escaping with decent shape. It is important to prevent something like this at all costs.]

(;W[gf]C[I wanted to cut black into two but a few moves later I felt too weak to fight here. Simply J17 might have been better?

Yes. Black is simply too strong here to expect anything good from a fight without any support.]

;W[hb];B[jc];W[jb];B[kc];W[id];B[jd];W[me];B[jg];W[ii];B[mg]

(;W[lg]TR[ii][ig][hg]C[I don't think this fight will be good for White. It will be very hard to separate Black's stones without allowing Black to capture White's three marked stones.

I think it would be better for White to simply make those stones live in good shape - the game would still be close.]
;B[lf];W[mf];B[lh]
(;W[ng];B[kg];W[mh];B[lg];W[nf];B[lj]C[I decided to give up the 3 stones and get profit on the right side.

Black's grou on the right is strong, so it is doubtful that White will be able to get adequate compensation.]
;W[ol];B[no];W[mo];B[nn]SQ[hp][io]LB[pm:A]C[White should definitely consider A now (it aims at the cut at P5) and would give Black bad shape.
The bottom is not important since Black's marked stones prevent WHite from making much territory there.]
;W[kp];B[iq];W[jr]LB[ll:A][kb:B]C[This isn't very important. 
I would prefer to play A to try to reduce Black's moyo.
White would also like to be able to play B sometime soon.];B[oc]

(;W[od];B[kb];W[mb];B[gd]C[This is not at all good for White.]
;W[ef];B[fe];W[dg];B[ff];W[cm]LB[ll:A]C[Perhaps a move around Q12 would have been bigger? Later the two stones seemed to be very resilient.

This feels a bit premature - I would like to reduce from the other side, aroud A. 

Q12 seems a little too small now, but it wouldnt't be bad. R12, however, seems more severe.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[ck];W[kn]C[This is good.];B[jm];W[kk];B[km];W[lk]
;B[mn];W[mj]C[I thought it should be enough to destroy half of his moyo and give some points at the bottom.

This was a nice exchange for White.];B[lq]

'A' makes better shape - Black can play a peep here.];B[cp]
;W[bp];B[ik];W[jj];B[dm];W[bn]C[Protecting against a black B6 but maybe that was too small.]

;B[ka]C[A good move which didn't see.]
