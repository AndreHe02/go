AB[pd][dp]C[Hi

My name is Bram Vandenbon
I play on KGS using the nickname WuQingyuan.
I was asked to review this game.
So here I go !];W[pq]C[TjP [16k\]: hi];B[cd];W[fc];B[dc];W[ff]

(;B[mp]CR[qn][pq]C[it would be more natural to keep some distance from white his shimari (marked stones)]

(;W[nn]C[I dont get the idea behind this white move. Its not taking territory, and it building influence there seems useless too !]

(;B[fb]C[Not needed. You are strong enough there are bigger moves at this time of the game.]
;W[fe]C[White playing bad shape here, but also his move is small.]

If I was going to play on that side I would prefer A though.]

(;W[fk]C[Running this high is very good for black, so dont stop running]

(;B[hj]TR[ej][ek][el]C[also if you want to stop running there make sure to have at least 3 stones, thats a lot stronger shape.

(;W[hl];B[hk];W[il];B[ll];W[ln]
(;B[kn]C[your black group at the bottum is still very weak. This move seems like you are creating another weak group while making white stronger. After that white can attack the bottum.

Also the taking the bottum territory is easy and big ! See variation]

[ol][pl]TR[le][kf][eg][kg][eh][jh][ii]C[No ! This cant work. Dont try to save 2 stones.

(1) its small
(2) you will make white stronger
(3) its impossible here

white will gain a lot of strength (the triangles) because of this ! You still had some possibilities to make a black moyo (the circles) at the right side, but after this that possibiliy is gone.]
;W[ii]LB[qc:D][dh:A][cm:B][lr:C]SQ[fa]C[In fact the left side still is very very weak

White can push through at A or B

White can also attack the group at the bottum with C and even kill it !

White D is also a Big move for white that will make you lose a lot of points !

So you can take your chance and secure some of these points]
;B[hh]SQ[fa][rc][sc][qd][rd][oe][af][bf][cf][of][pg][rh][sh]
[an][bn][cn][do][cq][cr][cs]C[Lets estimate the score like that

Top Left : 25

Bottum Left : 10

Top Right : 15

about 50 points for black here !];W[ih]CR[gp][hp][iq][ir]SQ[ia]

Top: 10

Center: 20

Bottum Right: 15

Circled group is a bit weak (see variation)

Komi : about 5 points

Total:
White has about 50 points]
(;B[fh]C[So the game is still pretty even !

The big question that goes on forever :
"who will grab most points ?"];W[eh]LB[qc:E][dh:B][pk:A][cm:D]
[lr:C]C[
A is big because it claims some territory but also it gives you a chance to claim the center ... A move for white in that area would be big too !



C is big for both sides too

B and D are also very big for both sides

E is big for white. Defending the corner is big for black ofcourse]
;B[fg]LB[qc:E][dh:B][pk:A][cm:D][lr:C]C[Personally I think C is really urgent at this time  and probably sente too !

After that I would go for B because it is very big in points,]

o1 was alive in seki yes];B[tt]C[Nice game, some things to remember though !

You made some mistakes at the start of the game ...

* move 40 tenuki too early left you with weak shape and created 2 dangerous cutting points !
* move 46 left a dangerous cutting point
* move 52 made your group at the bottum weak !

Those I concider as important because they have a big influence on the rest of the game.


There were also some less important mistakes due to not reading or not reading carefull enough. Those are less important because it could just be a matter of being stressed by the clock.

Thank you for letting me review this game. I hope this review was useful. I have tried putting a lot of time in it. So I hope it will be usefull. See you on KGS maybe.
