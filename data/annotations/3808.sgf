C[Dear Reviewer, this game was played between TheSpoon and myself on KGS. I played black and decided to resign, since I realized a lost game.

I have added some questions, where I am interested in special aspects of the game. But any comments you have for me would be greatly appreciated. Would you be so kind and review the game to find out my mistakes, please? Any idea which topic of Go I should especially train would be helpful. Thanks. Yanshou

catch22: Hi, I have been reviewing your game. I have tried to answer all your questions, and added comments at quite a few other places as well.

In general, my advice is to you is to try and read out sequences before playing a move. If you cannot see how the continuation benefits you, and it is not urgent to play in the area, play elsewhere. Otherwise you may find that a sequence which you played earlier without great benefit at the time, turns out to be the wrong one, spoiling your plans later on in the game. 

When you resist the temptation to play out sequences that do not work (well), you will be surprised how you will gain later on in the game, as you have many more options and should be able to better exploit the weaknesses in the position of your opponent.

Furthermore, in looking for moves, try to find ones that have multiple purposes. Ones that threathen your opponent at two places, or that extend your territory while attacking, or that connect your stones while cutting appart your opponent's stones, etc.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dd];W[dp];B[jd];W[dj];B[op]C[Yanshou: What about this approach move? Are there better points at this fuseki state?

catch22: I think an approach move here is good. It stops White from making a corner enclosure. At this moment, any move elsewhere on the board is just not as big.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jp];W[qf]
(;B[qh]TR[qn]C[catch22: I am not sure that this is the best move here.  White has the marked stone in place, which is strong. For Black it is likely to cause trouble for the stone that has just been played.

See my variation for an alternative way of playing.];W[qc];B[pc]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og]TR[qh]C[Yanshou: At this point I was quite satisfied with the beginning. How would you value this fuseki?

catch22: Not bad really. It offers enough options for the middle game, but I still feel that the marked Black stone is a bit without a purpose.]
;W[cf];B[df]C[Yanshou: I decided for the attach and extend joseki. The 1space pincer seems not severe, cause white has already occupied D10.

catch22: Yes, the one-space pincer would just be asking for trouble.]
;W[dg];B[qb]C[Yanshou: Probably a mistake.  R18 isnt sente, right? So white could have played around C16...

catch22: White should definitely still respond to this move Letting Black play S18 would put the White stones in great danger. Even if they could survive, it would be at a great cost. 

But indeed, the entire series of moves is not sente for Black so it is best left unplayed for now.]
;W[rb];B[qe];W[re]C[catch22: Unless you already have a follow-up planned do not play this move. If nothing else, you lost a good ko threat.]
;B[pb];W[qj]
(;B[ph]TR[qj]C[catch22: This is not a good move. First of all, saving the stone at R12 is not very important. Although it keeps the White group in the top right separated from the marked White stone, this does not matter. The group is not in danger. Threatening to link up with S12 gives it plenty eye space should it come under attack.

Secondly, even if Black plays elsewhere, White still cannot efficiently capture the Black stone. See variation.]
;W[hq]C[catch22: This is a big move by White, much more valuable than Black's last move. It is a dual purpose move. It puts pressure on Black's group (an invasion at M3 is now a good possibility) and also expands White's framework at the left.]
;B[ef];W[cq]C[catch22: I don't think this is an urgent move. It is gote, which lets Black play C15, a good point for both sides. I think White would have been better off playing at C15 himself. Black can hardly ignore that move so that White could then still re-inforce the bottom left corner.]
;B[ce]C[catch22: Good, this punishes White's mistake.];W[cg]
;B[jg];W[gh]C[Yanshou: At this point I feared the big white potential at the left side. How to reduce this framework?

catch22: That's a hard question. You need to ask a stronger player to get a decisive answer, but here are my thoughts anyway. :-)

I think this White move is a bit loose. The connection with the nearby stones can be cut. This may be a good way to start reducing White's framework. See the variation that I added.]

(;B[dm]C[catch22: I am not sure if this reduction is safe. See my variation for White's next move for an explanation.]

(;W[fc];B[ec];W[gf];B[ck];W[cn];B[cm];W[fk];B[dn];W[gd]C[Yanshou: From this point forward I made lots of bad moves, so in the end I had to resign.]
;B[jc];W[eg];B[cj];W[bn];B[do];W[co];B[ep];W[eq];B[fp];W[fq]
;B[gp];W[oj];B[om];W[pl];B[gq]C[catch22: This starts off an interesting couple of moves with both sides showing good spirit.]
;W[hp];B[jr];W[ho];B[hr];W[fn];B[eo];W[jq];B[iq];W[lq];B[kq]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[lo];B[jn];W[hm];B[nm];W[lm];B[ln]C[catch22: Don't play a move like this prematurely. Be sure that you have the strength to back it up.]
;W[kn];B[jm];W[mn]C[catch22: As it is, Black's move helped to strengthen White.]
;B[jk];W[fr];B[gr];W[lk];B[ls];W[lg]
(;B[le]C[catch22: This seems too submissive, especially considering that Black is behind in territory by now. Black's top left corner is the same size as White's bottom left corner. White has further territory at the right side, that Black cannot match by playing like this. Black's only chance seems to be to stir things up. See the variation.]
;W[ki];B[qs];W[qr];B[ps];W[rs];B[os];W[ri];B[rh]C[catch22: Letting Black play here was a mistake by White that could/should have been costly, as is shown shortly.]
;W[nn];B[po];W[on];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[rr]C[catch22: This moves is bad. It lets White defends the weakness in his position. Always think carefully before playing a move like this. There may be much better possibilities, which disappear as a result. See the variation for a better way of playing.]
;W[rq];B[pn];W[pm];B[ss];W[pp];B[oo];W[rn]
(;B[sd]C[catch22: This attack leads nowhere, and gives White points by "forcing" him to play S19. See the variation for a better way to play.]
;W[ra];B[sc];W[sb];B[hb];W[fb];B[eb];W[il];B[si]C[catch22: This is a horrible move. It is small and gote. If you do not intend to save this stone, you should not play it as sacrificing it gains nothing.]
;W[sj];B[qi];W[sh];B[pj];W[pk];B[pi];W[rg]C[catch22: The only thing Black achieved with the sequence starting with T11 was to let White connect,  help White to extra territory in doing so, and leave himself with a horrible clump of stones.]
;B[nj]TR[lg]C[catch22: Try to read out sequences before playing them. If they do not work, you are only destroying your future possiblities. 

For instance, Black cannot currently cut of the marked White stone, but maybe later on after Black played another stone nearby, e.g. at K11. So try to keep your options open. Playing out any sequence reduces your possiblities, so make sure it is worth it.]
;W[ni];B[oi];W[ok];B[qk]C[catch22: This move and the Black move that follows have no purpose. Don't play them without a proper plan. If nothing else, you wasted two good ko threats.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[mh];W[mi];B[nh];W[lh]TR[nj]C[catch22: This sequence got Black nowhere. If anything, it increased White's territory (the marked Black stone is a loss without compensation) and helped White to secure his stones (e.g. Black "forced" White to connect his M13 stone).]
;B[ih];W[hi];B[di];W[ei];B[ej];W[fj];B[ek];W[dh]
(;B[el]C[catch22: It is good not to mindlessly reply to your opponent's moves. However, if you don't, you should have a good reason. In this case, Black should simply play C11. See the variation.]
;W[ci];B[fm];W[gm];B[go];W[hn];B[he];W[ge];B[bf];W[bg];B[af]
;W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[db];W[ag];B[be];W[ii];B[ji]C[catch22: Black now seems to realise the value of keeping his stones connected, and separating White's groups. But it is too late now...]
;W[jj];B[jl];W[jo];B[io];W[ko];B[ij];W[jh];B[gl];W[fl];B[em]
;W[ip]C[Yanshou: Thanks for reviewing.

catch22: No problem. I hope you found my comments valuable.]
)
(;B[ci];W[el];B[dk]C[catch22: Capturing a White stone gives Black two points, as opposed to the variation in the game, where White gets a point by capturing Black's stone. This is not much, but Black now also has the option to make territory at the side (starting with a descent at B7), and White's position has more weaknesses then in the game, which can also lead to gains later on.]
))
(;B[ra]TR[rh]C[catch22: If nothing else, this reduces White's territory. 
In fact, because Black now has the marked stone in place, Black seems to be able to kill White's group.]

Black even has the option of trying to kill the group in a ko fight (starting with T3) but he has to make sure he has more big ko threats than White before doing so because Black stands to loose a lot when he loses the ko fight.]
)
(;W[rn]C[White may be better off defending his territory at the side.]
;B[pm];W[ql]C[Either way, Black has a much better result than in the game.]
)))
(;B[li]TR[mq][lq][lo][kn][lm][mn][lk]C[catch22: Consider playing here. White may be able to save his stone by either linking up to the left or right. But in doing so, Black may build up sufficient strength to surround (and kill) White's marked stones. Also White has to be a bit careful with his stones at the left. Although it's a big group, it does not have definite eyes yet. Black will unlikely to kill it, but may strengthen his own position by playing attacking forcing moves., which may help his position elsewhere. 

So although the continuation is unclear, this move has multiple purposes, and seems to better take into account the possiblities that still exist around the board. If Black wants to catch up, he has to play a bit more daring like this.]
))
(;W[fm]C[catch22: This move seems to put Black on the spot. It is not clear to me if it can run away to safety. But it is not obvious either how it can make two eyes, as the White stones at either side are strong.]

;B[fg];W[ff];B[gg]TR[ff]C[But this does not go anywhere for White. Black's three cutting stones are pretty safe, where's White's marked cutting stone seems to be dead. So Black is expanding his framework while reducing White's.]

(;W[fg]C[White can also try to cut off Black's stone like this...]
;B[eg];W[eh];B[fi]C[Black's two cutting have indeed successfully been cut off, so a fight will ensue. However, it is a fight that Black does not have to fear. White has his own cutting stones to look after. Furthermore, as Black's two stones run away, they reduce White's framework.]

;W[gj];B[hi];W[hj];B[ii];W[ho]C[But in doing so, White has built up a substantial framework as well. It is slightly smaller, but White still has territory elsewhere, whereas Black doesn't.]
;B[di]C[There may still be a weakness in White's framework...]

))
(;B[dk]C[catch22: If you want to enter White's framework deeply, then this is maybe a better starting point than D7. As it is a contact play, it will be easier for Black to create shape (and eyes should White try to stop it from running away). Of course, don't try to safe this stone at all cost. It is fine to sacrifice it, as long as it helps other Black stones to reduce White's framework.

I will give one potential continuation, to give an idea of what can happen. However, there are many possibilities and undoubtedly mine is far from optimal.]

;W[el];B[em];W[fl];B[eo];W[cm];B[cn];W[bl];B[go]C[Something like this could happen. Black stones may not have ideal shape, but they seem to have escaped successfully. 

Although Black has to be aware of a potential splitting attack by White, starting with a White move at or near J5, White still has his own weak spot at F3 to worry about first.

Furthermore, although White's group at the left side has become very strong, this should not worry Black. The stones are too close together to be efficient, and surround not much territory.]
