C[watku: Hi! I'm black in this game. I've lost my playing skills totally I would like to know what I'm doing wrong and why do I always loose :)

I thought I played quite good, but still I lost the game.

catch22: Hi, I'll be the reviewer for this game. I hope you will find my comments useful.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fq];W[jj]C[watku: This looks weird to me, but I'm not sure did I use it correctly.

catch22: This is indeed an unusual move. I for instance have never seen a professional game with a move in the center being played this early on. The reason is that at this stage of the game it is impossible to determine what the best place is for this stone. As more stones appear on the board, and fighting starts, it may very well be that this stone would be better placed elsewhere.

However, moves like these are more commonly seen in Internet games. One advantage is that the player that plays it is probably more experienced with the best way to follow it up than his opponent is with the right counter moves.

So what does White gain by this move? Mainly two things. Firstly, nearly all ladders in any of the corners will now work out in his favour. Secondly, it helps White in the fighting that may follow. If later in the game a weak white group has to run out into the center, it already has an ally in the center that can facilitate the escape.  

So how to best deal with it? With patience and a good strategy. A move like this is aiming for influence as opposed to territory. So Black has to start by keeping White's influence under control, while making the most of his advantage at the edge of the board, where he has more stones. In the long run, Black can also aim to make the center stone appear "out of place".]
;B[cj]C[catch22: This seems to be a good way of dealing with the white stone in the center.]
;W[cl]
(;B[cf]C[watku: Was this too long extension?

catch22: No, this is definitely playable. Although it invites a white invasion at C12 (as happens in the game), Black can deal with this.

Playing C13 instead (see variation) is I think not as good for Black.]
;W[ch]
(;B[cc]C[catch22: Jumping right into the corner has the advantage that it is simple. However, letting White build a wall facing the left side fits his influence-based strategy very well. Therefore, I would be reticent to play like this. I would prefer playing B12 instead. See variation.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[fd];B[gc]
C[catch22: I think this result is good for White. The white wall works well with the stone in the center. White is beginning to create a large mojo at the left side of the board. Therefore, I would have prefered for Black not to jump into the top-left corner immediately.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[lc]TR[gc]C[catch22: This is not a good move by White. It is only concerned with destroying potential black territory, but it does not do anything constructive. Because of the strong black stone at G17, there is no good way for White to settle this stone, and it will have to run away.]

(;B[qe]TR[pd][nd]C[catch22: This is not the way to punish White. Black is now only concerned with securing corner territory. However, this cannot be done efficiently, given the placement of the two marked black stones. These fit a center-oriented strategy and should be used that way. See the variation for a better way of playing.]
;W[ic]
(;B[mc]C[catch22: This move is not good either. You should generally only use contact plays as a last resort, for instance to defend a weak group when there is no other way of doing so. The problem with playing contact moves is that they help to strenghten the opponent's stones as well. When White extends to M16 in response he will have settled his stone at M17 that once could have been a nice target to attack.

See the variation for a better way of playing.];W[pf];B[pj]
;W[pm];B[nf]C[watku: Here I probably attacked from the wron side because Q10 is so weak?

catch22: No, I don't think so. Playing here is important for Black, as he wants to keep access to the center. If Black would play elsewhere, White would be happy to play at O14 himself, and any attack would then soon fizzle out. 

Although Q10 is weak, it is not in any real danger yet. Black also does not have a good attacking move from this direction. Both Q12 or R12 would be too close to the black stone at Q10.]
;W[oh]
(;B[og]C[catch22: This is a bad move. As Black cannot cut, he should not try. It only helps White to strengthen his stones, and makes Black's stone at Q10 weaker.]
;W[ph]TR[og]C[catch22: The exchange of the two marked stones has clearly been in White's favour.]

(;W[dq]C[catch22: See variation.];B[cp];W[do];B[co];W[cn];B[dr]
;W[er];B[cr];W[eq]TR[hq][kp]C[catch22: White's wall is now in the wrong direction. The marked white stone is too close to it, and the marked black stone also reduces the value of the wall significantly.]
;B[dh]C[catch22: Black puts his stones at the left in motion. In the game, he gets a good result. However, I think if White had played better, these stones would not have been able to live, and escaping would have been difficult as well.]

(;W[ci]C[catch22: White should probably exchange B6 for B5 first. See variation.]
;B[di];W[cg];B[dg];W[df];B[bi]C[watku: This was unnecessary

catch22: Indeed, it deprives Black of the option to play a forcing move at E14 instead, and also needlessly strengthens White's stones.]
;W[bf];B[bk]C[watku: and this was just stupid :)

catch22: Indeed, this is asking for the cut.];W[dj];B[dk];W[ej]
;B[ck];W[dl]C[catch22: This move by White is not very good and only induces Black to play where he wants to.]
;B[ek];W[fj];B[bl]
(;W[bm]C[catch22: White now wishes that he had exchanged B6 for B5 earlier on. In that case, he would not have to respond at B7 to prevent Black from linking up, and could instead have prevented Black from getting two eyes.

Now it is too late for White to play B6. See variation.];B[aj]

(;W[bh]C[watku: I don't know why white let me live here.

catch22: By now, White could not kill Black anymore. See variation.]
;B[al];W[kr]
(;B[jr]C[catch22: This looks like a non-tesuji to me. I think Black is better off playing N2 directly. See variation.]

(;B[ll]C[catch22: It is essential for Black to keep White separated. See variation.]
;W[pk];B[ok];W[qj]C[catch22: White scored a big success here. His two weak groups changed into one strong one, that even surrounds nearly twenty points of territory. Black on the other hand has stones afloat in the center, that are nothing but a worry.]
;B[jl];W[jp]C[catch22: This is the wrong direction for White. White should instead have played L5, to prevent Black from linking up here. 

White's move is especially inefficient because it makes White's stone at H3 entirely meaningless. It might as well not have been there. Given that it is there, it is no big deal to let Black play at K4 and even J4 next. White is not going to efficiently surround territory here anyway.]
;B[ko];W[jo];B[kn]C[catch22: Black should be happy with this result. Black does not have to worry about his stones at the center anymore, as they are now safely linked up. Although White surrounded some territory, this is not much, especially because Black can still reduce it by playing E8 or K6.]
;W[hk];B[el];W[em];B[dm];W[cm]TR[dm]C[catch22: There was no point in exchanging the marked stones. Black should have just left D7 unplayed and played at F7 directly.]

;W[jd];B[jb];W[ib];B[ka];W[kc];B[ja];W[ia];B[la];W[id]TR[jd]
[ib][ia][jc][jb][ja][ka]C[catch22: Let's evaluate the result. Although Black made sure that White did not get any territory at the top, White would not have gotten much anyway. Furthermore, Black did not gain any points himself. Worst of all, White got to play the four marked stones, which are worth a whole lot more than Black's four stones (which are worth nothing). Furthermore, Black actually ends in gote, because he now has to defend his territory at the top left. 

So, what appeared to be a tesuji, actually was far from that. :-(]
;B[gb];W[jg];B[ig];W[jf];B[jh];W[kg];B[kh];W[je]C[catch22: White should have just played elsewhere. The three Black stones were captured as is.]
;B[gg];W[fg];B[hh];W[hg];B[if];W[hi];B[gg];W[fi];B[gj]C[watku: I stopped to think here... :-(

;W[gk];B[ij];W[ik];B[ii];W[jk];B[hj];W[in];B[gi];W[fh];B[mh]
C[catch22: This move is not good. It encourages White to play at F9, to which Black has to respond. So Black ends in gote, without gaining anything.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[oj]TR[gk][hk][ik][jk][jj][lj]C[catch22: Although White's marked stones are close to being cut off, it appears that he has read it out correctly, so White goes for profit (still S15 would be better).]
;B[fk];W[hm];B[gm];W[hl];B[fl];W[mj];B[nk];W[jm]C[catch22: White did not even have to play here. If Black plays at J7, White can respond at K7 then, and all will be fine.]
