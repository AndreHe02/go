C[Dear reviewer!
In this game I was playing as White, and although I won, I don't think it was deserved:
1) I was behind in the opening;
2) My attempt to invade at the left ended in surrounding my group with only one eye (saved only by my trick play and Black's blunder in the end)
3) My attempt to kill his center group ended in it creating two eyes
4) I spent too many moves by chasing his right group, while it had pretty much chances to flee or make the second eye.
In general, I would be happy to receive any advice on my style of play, and how to make it more solid.
Thanks!

Hello Googol,
my name is Marek and I am happy to review your game.
Unfortunatelly you haven't provided your own comments and questions in this file on the relevant moves, so I will just review whatever I think needs explaining, could be done better, or is an outright mistake. And I will do so for both sides, but of course I'll concentrate on your moves.

If I seem harsh at places, I do not intend to offend you. I was an 8k myself. So just try to learn something from my suggestions and I hope it can help you improve.

Also, I think I answered all of your points 1-4 carefully, just read through the review. But I am not sure how to make a game more solid. A style of the play is a pretty advanced topic, which doesn't come up until one grasps the basics (I am not even sure I have a style and I am almost 2k KGS), so instead just try to learn from whatever resource you can and do lots of life and death and you should be on your way to dan ;-)]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd]
(;W[dp]LB[ec:A]C[If you dislike big frameworks, as I do, you could try something more funky to prevent it. See variation for white at A.]
;B[ic]
(;W[jp]LB[qf:B][dj:A]C[This move seems a bit passive. I would prefer to do something with the black's already big framework. See variation.

Also, sanrensei is an influence oriented strategy, but after black taking the key point at A, white cannot hope to utilize it very well. Also the almost absolute next white's move B doesn't play well with this framework.]
;B[dj];W[qf]
(;B[qh]LB[qj:A][qn:B]C[Pincer is possible: it is looking to separate white stone from the sanrensei, which is a good strategy. But I would prefer to play the looser pincer at A. It accomplishes the same task, while being less attackable by white. Also, with A, black can aim at B later.]

(;W[of]LB[nc:B][qc:A]C[This move is strange. See variations at A and B for what I would prefer.]
;B[nd]
(;W[mf]LB[pi:A]C[This move should be good. Other possibility is to play at A, but it seems it's not that good in the context of the whole board. See variation.]

(;B[qk]LB[ld:A]C[Black usually plays at A to defend the top and white pincers at R9 (see variation) but here it's no good for him, so he plays here. Naturally, as he hadn't defended the top, white can do something there.]

(;W[rd]C[This move is not necessary. It makes black's corner stronger. S16 should be saved for making life and endgame. Here white is fully out, so he has nothing to be afraid of.

See variation for what white can do with the corner.];B[qc]
;W[qn]LB[qm:A]C[This move should be at A as that would put more pressure on black.]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[ol];W[rc]LB[ld:A]C[Again, this move is for endgame. A much better.]
;B[rb];W[qd]LB[ld:A]C[And again. After this, A wouldn't even be sente, as black is alive in the corner now.]
;B[pb];W[rl]C[This move is bad. White cannot hope to kill black.]
;B[rk]LB[ql:A]C[Not a bad move, but I think A is better for black. He would get a better shape for running out into the center.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[nh];B[rm];W[ql];B[pl];W[qm];B[sl];W[rn];B[sm]
;W[sn];B[sk]TR[rm]C[Saving the marked stone is worth two points and is tottaly unimportant for both players, as there are still 20+ points worth moves.]
;W[on]TR[ed][eh][cn]C[This is very small and also doesn't attack the black group at all. Possible moves for white here are are at the marked places.]
;B[pj]C[This move is not important, as black can't be attacked seriously (he is almost alive and can also get out). Black should concentrate on making moyo, or invading white's framework.]
V[-14.8];W[oh]C[Again unimportant.];B[cn]C[This is a very important move. Now we can see that black is ahead, having two big frameworks on the left and the top and also some territory.]

(;W[co]LB[cj:A][dj:B]TR[jp]C[This move is bad. It is for attacking purposes only, when there is white stone at A or B. Here, white is just helping black stabilize himself. Instead, white should play tsuke-nobi (attach and extend) joseki, because the marked stone is well placed. See variation.]
;B[dn];W[fp]LB[cq:A]C[After this exchange, both got approximately same amount of territory, but black is stabilized and there is still weaknes at A (see variation), so white is not good.]

(;B[ed]C[A good move.];W[dg]C[White has no other option than to invade. This is a good place to start from.]
;B[ch]LB[fg:B][ci:A]C[This black move is bad. If he feels an urge to defend the middle left group, he should play A instead. But really he should attack and for that, B is the keypoint.

If there is a losing move it is this one. By not attacking the invading white stone properly, black didn't gain anything at all and even lost much of his potential territory. Such is a game of go. You can lead by much first 50 moves, but any mistake will cost you your lead. Therefore, never slack, play to your fullest potential the whole game.]
;W[cg]LB[fg:A]C[This move is also bad. White is creating a heavy group. He should play A instead.]
;B[bf]
(;W[bg]LB[fg:A]C[Again, not good. The group is even heavier now and the cut isn't that big. Jumping at A is still better.]
;B[bh];W[ag];B[ah]C[Both sides continue to make these bad moves...]
;W[be];B[bd];W[cf];B[le]LB[fg:A]C[This is not a place to play at all. Black should play A and continue the attack to build territory.]
;W[lf]C[A bad move. White group is very strong and practically alive, so no need to play here. Also, this move helps black build territory.]
;B[ke];W[ge]C[This is the place to play.];B[gc];W[dh]LB[ci:A]
[di:B][cj:C]C[Here black's play at A is a bad shape (emptry triangle) and the group feels a little weaker than with the play at C.
The correct shape would be at B, but here it doesn't work. Therefore, black should play at C.]

(;B[ci];W[dl]LB[gh:A]C[This is not a good move. Black's group is strong, so white cannot accomplish anything useful here. He should play at A to move out.]

(;B[el]LB[cl:A]C[A very bad move. Black should play at A to stay connected.]
;W[dk];B[ck]
(;W[ek]LB[cl:A]C[This move let's black connect. See variation for the play at A.]
;B[cl];W[em]LB[ej:A]TR[el]C[The marked stone is utterly unimportant. Why do you need to capture it? Black will just walk out of the atari and what will white do then?

Therefore really no need to play here. Instead play at A.];B[fl]
;W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[en];W[fm];B[dm]TR[be][cf][ag][bg][cg][dg]
[dh][dk][ek][dl][em][fm]C[Now white has three weak groups!!!]
;W[gl]LB[gh:B][em:A]TR[be][cf][ag][bg][cg][dg][dh]C[A bad move. White has completely forgotten about the weak marked group. But this is a result of playing Atari at A. White got only what he wanted.

So I think no need to emphasize, but white should play at B to save the weak group and not here.]

(;B[fk]C[No need to save these stones by black. He should play from the other side and sacrifice. See variation.]
;W[ej]TR[be][cf][ag][bg][cg][dg][dh]C[White stubbornly continues to ignore his marked group...]

;B[io];W[kp]C[Black doing very bad here. Just helping white build territory.]
;B[mo]
(;W[ko]LB[mq:A]C[This move is questionable as white can attack neither of the black groups successfully. I would prefer to play at A to defend.]
;B[mm];W[ln];B[mn];W[jm];B[im];W[jl]LB[gl:A][hn:B]C[Attacking this strong black group is pointless. It already has half eyes at A and B. If white tries to destroy those eyes, black can easily run away, even threatening to kill the left white group.]

(;B[hf]LB[fh:A]C[Black can think about A. See variation.];W[he]
LB[fh:A]C[A bad move. White cannot hope to accomplish anything with a half-dead group. A play at A is a must!]
;B[ie];W[hd]C[\]];B[hc];W[id];B[jd];W[jf];B[if];W[je];B[jg]
;W[kf]C[This is what I would call a blunt attack by white. He tried to kill so hard that he got his own group killed. This happens often even in dan games. For the future: try more to foresee where the attack will lead and whether you can gain something by it. If you can't, it's not a good attack. But if you even lose more than your opponent, then it's really horrible.]
;B[gf];W[fe]LB[fh:A]TR[hd][id][ge][he]C[White should of course sacrifice the marked stones and live with A. Saving them destroys one of his eyes and also threatens to destroy the other one.]
;B[ff]LB[fh:A]C[Black also lost a track again. He could kill at A.]

(;W[hn]LB[dd:B][gn:A]C[This is a bad move. It can be captured by black at A.

But more importantly, white should have played at B. There are many interesting variations there  (I encourage you to work your way through them) and he can live with at least part of his group.]

(;B[kd]LB[lc:A]C[This is a mistake by black. He has to defend at A.]

(;W[ld]LB[lc:A]C[White should have played at A to exploit the weakness. See variation.]

;B[od];W[nm];B[nl]LB[ml:A];W[gn]C[Why hasn't white cut? It seems ignoring a major plays is a common theme in this game.]

(;W[ri]LB[sh:B][nj:C][rj:A]C[This does not kill. Black defends at A. To kill, white plays at B.

Black even has C, so he really is alive. But for the sake of the following discussion of next few moves, assume there is a white stone at C.]

(;B[sh]LB[nj:A][rj:B]C[This would be a mistake, if there was a white stone at A. Black should have played at B in that case.]
;W[qi]LB[nj:A][rj:B]C[This still would not kill, even with a stone at A. The keypoint is at B.]

(;B[ph]LB[nj:A][rj:B]C[Again, this would die with the stone at A. Black should have played at B.

The reason why I am still repeating this is because it seems both players play as if there indeed was a stone at A :-)]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[km];B[oo];W[po]LB[op:A]C[A very bad move. It is important to defend the territory at A.]
;B[nq]LB[oq:A]

[rj:A];W[mj];B[nn];W[om];B[kj];W[kk];B[kl];W[jk];B[ki]LB[dd:B]
[rj:A]C[Up until now black's plays were sente to make a second eye or to connect, so they weren't absolutely bad in that he wouldn't die after playing them. But this is clearly a mistake, as white can kill black with A now. Similarly, black can kill white at B.]
;W[dd]LB[rj:A]C[White noticed this spot finally after 50 moves. Still, killing black at A is a lot better than this.]
;B[dc];W[ec];B[fd]C[A bad move. White is alive now. See the variations at move 144 for the correct play by both.]
;W[cc];B[db];W[bc];B[ac];W[ce];B[bb];W[ad]C[As for everyone who plays go, there are many areas you can improve in. The most important topics for you to study, based on this review are:

-- Life and death --
there were some mistakes in this game. It also has to do with letting your group lie around with unsettled. Moreover, doing a lot of life and death problems is a most certain way to improve.

-- Global board position judgement --
just experiment in fuseki with the ideas from this review

-- Awareness of the urgent play --
to let your group lie around for 50 moves for your opponent to kill it, or not to kill your opponent's one when you can is a huge error. It has to do with the previous point. Just look over all the board, and ask yourself: "Is this alive? Could this be killed?". It is important to always know the precise status of every group on the board so that you play moves that need to be played and decide your strategy accordingly. You certainly shouldn't go invading enemy framework, when one of your groups is about to be killed...

-- Principles of attacking --
when attacking, don't look for a kill. Always try to visualize for yourself the resulting position after the planned attack. The goal is to build territory and/or influence while attacking. If your attack does not achieve that, it was a bad attack to begin with. More on this in the book Attack and Defence by Ishida and Davies.

-- Light and heavy play, shape --
this is an advanced concept, but you too can learn from it anyway. You certainly know situations, where you had to save big cramped group without eyes (in short, a heavy group) and your opponent happily attacks you. No matter whether you can survive or not, saving such a group almost always involves your opponent developing a good position and so it is a loss (that is, if he attacks correctly, as explained in this review. Going for the all out kill is a primitive and usually bad way of attacking and should be avoided). Instead of making such heavy groups, be prepared to sacrifice some stones in order to get a better shape. More on this in the book Shape Up! by Charles Matthews.

Of course, no amateur can hope to comprehend all of this and utilize it well in their games, even if they devoted years to study go. I am weak at all of these points myself, otherwise I wouldn't be reviewing your game, but playing professionaly in Japan :-)

But we can always struggle to get a little better, so I hope I have given you some useful pointers.]

The logic is thus: if there is more than one keypoint, playing at one directly will enable your opponent to take the other (miai). While if you first reduce the eyeshape, your opponent often has no choice but to defend and then only one key point is left for you to take.

The other reason is that the group's eyeshape could be simply to big to kill the group directly. If that is the case, it is only natural not to jump right into the eyeshape, but to reduce it first.

Remember this rule, it should help you solve many life and death problems easily.]

Of course, nothing's is decided yet. White will have to invade deeply to catch up and the game will get quite complicated.]

(;W[qf];B[nd];W[pj];B[dj]LB[ec:A][eh:B]C[This is one possible variations. Next white should think about invasion A or reduction B. (see the continuactions). Of course, other plays are possible.]

;B[ch];W[ee];B[ec];W[hd];B[hc];W[hh]C[This is possible. White shouldn't expect to get much out of the position (like hoping to get all of black's territory), as black already had three more stones there. He should just make good shape and move out quickly.]

(;W[ec];B[dq];W[do]C[This is one possible arrangement. There is nothing to be afraid of when playing tenuki from the corner this early. In fact, I think there is an important point to be learned from this: "Don't follow your opponent around the board". You should only play locally, if it's absolutely neccesary, like preventing killing your big group, and so on. More generally speaking: you should always play the most important point on the board. Of course it is often very hard to find it, but you should look for it on the whole board, not just locally. Just try to experiment with this in your own games.

One more note: count the number of stones in the local position for both sides. While the numbers of stones are equal, everything is ok, no matter who plays next. But tenuki after, eg. black's C7 next would be questionable (see the continuation of this variation). Of course it is also possible, but the game gets rather complicated and you have to consider such a tenuki really carefully.]

(;B[fp];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp];B[br];W[en];B[dk]C[He would get a heavy eyeless group that needs much looking after, while black is developing nicely on both sides.

Another important note: you don't have to kill your enemy. In fact, trying to do so will often lead to unpredictable fights with random results. Instead, just try to get profit by attacking like here. The one who should be afraid here is white (looking for the way to live or escape) and not black, desperately looking for a kill.]
)
(;B[co];W[dn];B[cn]C[Black can also play this way. We can see, that he got much territory, has a nice position, while white's stones are cramped on the black wall.]
