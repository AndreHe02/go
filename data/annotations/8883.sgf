C[Hello, this game was played on EGC 2012. Please review for White.

I often fall back with slow moves (at least that's my impression) or miss urgent points.
What went wrong (as the game-end was close) and how to improve?

*****

Hello, Jens!

My name is Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and other go places. I was also at the EGC so it's especially fun for me to review this game for you now. :-)]

C[Hon: This move is a mistake. After black has given White the corner, he should extend solidly to A.]
(;W[cj]LB[ne:A]C[Hon: Punishing is a dangerous thing - if it succeeds, you have a very good game, but if you fail it might turn back on you. But if you don't try to punish right away, you risk that Black will tidy up his shape with a move like A.

If I can see no clear way to punish, I normally don't. If you miss that kind of chance, normally you still have a playable game. You can also look at it like this - it's your opponent who has the weak spot in his shape for which he has to take care sooner or later. 

So I can understand this move here, just going on with the fuseki.]

(;W[of]C[Hon: This looks a bit slow. Although it prepares a kind of double attack. Was that your intention?]
;B[qk]
(;W[fq];B[dq];W[iq];B[qn]TR[of]C[Hon: Black's move may look small, but it takes all pressure off the group and the marked stone isn't doing that much anymore.

It only looks small but is actually very important!];W[np]
(;B[rp];W[qq]C[Hon: This would have been a good moment for invading at the top. Of course this move here is also big.]
;B[lq]
(;W[nr]C[JUG: too timid ?

Hon: Yes.]
(;B[kp]
(;W[io]
(;B[ln]
(;W[nn]C[Hon: This looks too passive. See variations.];B[jn]
;W[lc]C[JUG: too deep or early?

Hon: Not too early ... but maybe the wrong timing, since he can put pressure on your lower group again now.

Anyway, probably now you have to invade or you are behind.]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[kc]
(;W[ke];B[lb];W[jc];B[kb];W[id];B[le];W[je]C[Hon: This sequence looked more natural and locally also good for you, but actually black has no real trouble, being alive on both sides, while it is not clear how you will use your thickness. 

Black has sente and can take control of the situation at the bottom. You look behind on points now.]
;B[qb];W[rb];B[ra];W[rc];B[en]C[Hon: This looks slack.];W[hm]
;B[go];W[gn]
(;B[fo];W[ho]C[Hon: Like this he just let you get stronger.]
;B[jl];W[hk]
(;B[rg]C[Hon: Since developing the center would be your only chance to make more points, he should go on jumping into the center instead.]
;W[jj]C[Hon: He gives you the keypoint for attack and thereby runs the risk of losing his control of the lead.]
;B[mr];W[kr];B[mm];W[nm];B[ml]
(;W[ol];B[ge]C[Hon: This is annoying because after this move it is hard to create center territory. K10 might end up useless.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[mj];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[jo];B[nq];W[oq];B[mq]
;W[pr];B[kq];W[jq];B[ko];W[ql];B[rl]
(;W[rm];B[qm];W[pl];B[rk]C[Hon: What a pity!];W[ro];B[qo];W[qp]
;B[rq];W[rr];B[rn];W[lf];B[gg];W[md];B[me];W[nd];B[mc];W[oc]
;B[ob]LB[of:A][rm:E][nn:D][fq:B][nr:C]TR[ke][ol]C[JUG: can W still win this? center feels too easily reducable ...

Hon: No, the game should be over now. Black is about 15 points ahead and it's already endgame. You catch up a bit later, but it's not enough.

You played some slow moves and missed some good opportunities. I have marked the slow moves or mistakes with letters in this diagram, so you can go there and look at them again. The marked stones look not-so-good to me, but it is hard to call them mistakes, because the top is thickness after all, and P8 prepared a sharp crosscut.

In the beginning you asked the general question, how to get stronger. Besides playing serious games and getting them reviewed (as you seem to do), solving go problems is very helpful. Try to get in the habit of doing 15 minutes of them every day. Just like a tennis or a soccer player has to train his condition and his muscles, a go player has to work at his "reading muscle". If you do your workout regularly, you will be sharper than your opponents and you will outplay them more often. 

Another important thing is, that you try to always play serious: Think hard, always count points, always read out as much as you can. Never play like: "Ah, this move looks alright ..." No guessing on the go board! :-)]

;B[ke];W[mc];B[me];W[nd]C[Hon: If you play like this, the territorial balance shifts - now he is behind.]
;B[in]C[Hon: But now he can pressure your group at the bottom somehow. In addition to his thickness at the top he might get some points in the center (not too many though, probably).]

(;W[rq]C[Hon: Just like in the upper right, locally this is the normal answer.]

))
(;W[qm]TR[of]C[Hon: I think you have to play this move here now. It puts pressure on black. The marked stone will work as a "wall" now, you drive him against your strength like a ship towards a cliff. 

After he defends, you can still play on the lower side. And even after a defensive move you will have further tactics against this group.

To destabilize a group like this by limiting the eyespace is urgent in the fuseki. In this case it is especially urgent since like this your marked stone ends up actually doing something!]
)
(;W[lc]TR[of]C[Hon: This is also an option since the marked stone helps the invader.

But I like the other attack better since after your invasion you might get a weak group of your own, while attacking the group on the right first is safe for you but annoying for him.]
))
(;W[qb]C[Hon: This is the normal answer. Black was able to play the marked stone in sente, but you live with profit and damage Black's upper side. 

This move is not only safe, but also very large! Your jump in the game is only safe, but not large, it does not take points.]
))
(;AE[pb][qc]LB[pb:A][qc:B]TR[jd]C[Hon: Normally, if Black wants to play the marked stone, he does not exchange A for B.]
;W[lc]LB[qc:A]TR[nc]C[Hon: If White invades, then Black has still the option to enter at A, so his marked stone is in no trouble. Black is flexible here so he does not fear White's invasion.]
;AW[qc]AB[pb]TR[pb][qc]C[Hon: After the exchange of the marked stones, that is after White's invasion, he is not flexible any longer. It looks like White has "invaded", because he is already safe in the corner.]
