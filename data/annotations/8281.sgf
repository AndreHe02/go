C[Hello reviewer,

in this game I played with white against a stronger player. It was played on the KGS as part of a league. I really did my best here, so I would like to know someone elses opinion on my decisions. I am especially interested in the direction of play now.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[po]C[B: I didnt want him to play on a large scale so I approached here]

;B[mo]C[Janr: up to here everything is fine];W[qr]C[B: Is this joseki good here? He got a lot with his ladderbreaker, should I just protect the cut at S4?

Janr: this is the difficult variation.  If white has a ladder breaker, or his ladder breaker is sente, he can play this move.]

;B[om];W[rk];B[qk];W[rl];B[de];W[mm];B[ee]C[B: my opponent asked after the game if this move or E16 is better to capture the stone

janr: I would prefer C16 or C17.  It seems too easy for white to live in the corner here?]
;W[dj]C[janr: White can wait with living in the corner, 
Still, I would prefer to play at the lower side to attack the black groun which is weakened now.]
;B[jq];W[oc];B[mc];W[qc]C[B: I decided to play safe and take the corner, but should I better jump? What possibilities do I have after the jump?

janr: after the jump, white would try to press on the top.   The development in the game does look satisfactory for white.]
;B[rc];W[pd];B[qe];W[qb];B[rb];W[ne];B[qh];W[ld];B[kc];W[fq]
C[B: This feels very big to me, but maybe leaving behind K16 for b is too painful

Janr: white is not fully alive yet, so pressing a bit more until alive is big, especially because black is strong on the left, and a black move here will both attack white and give black territory.]
(;B[bp]C[janr: Locally, alternatives exist.  If black will answer keima to the 3-3 answer, then I would prefer to 3-4 attachment to start with (see variation)]
;W[cq];B[cn]C[janr: the extension is very small.  Why not jumping one or two points further?]
;W[cl];B[do];W[bq];B[ep];W[eq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ch];W[em];B[fn]
;W[ce];B[cf]C[B: I was more woried about a crosscut];W[ec];B[cd]
C[janr: it is hard to kill white.  Black did not get enough from the ladder breaker.]

;W[gl];B[hm]
(;W[qj]C[B: looks slow. Is there a good way to help the D10 group?

janr: reinforcing the left group is a good idea.  It also helps to reduce the potential of black to make territory on top.

Another idea is to reduce the bottom black, such that blacks cutting point get more important (see variation)]

   Black = 63 territory + 18 captures = 81
Black wins by 5.5.



Janr:
In the beginning, white played well, and black could not make good value of the ladder breaker.
However, later white made mistakes.  His group on the left became weak, cut with an empty triangle, and 5 stones captured.
Later, white made a few more minor mistakes, such as not connecting f16 and in the endgame around h3]

The ladder does not work, but if white has one extra liberty by not playing the empty triangle, he has more aji.]
