AB[pd][dp][pp]C[Dear reviewer,

thank you in advance for your efforts in commenting this game. I made some remarks of my own, but additional hints and variations are, of course, welcome.

-- Dear Sven, my name is Zoran Rilak and I'll be doing review for Black as requested.  I'm about 10k on KGS, where you can find me under the nickname 'wayward'.
  Do write back your thoughts on this comment!  If anything was amiss, I'd be glad to rectify.

  My comments and variations are all on the main game line.]

(;B[cp]C[-- C4 is okay, it goes along fine with your territorial style.  But in handicap games, especially so with mid-handicap as this one, it is good to remember that much more important than making territory is retaliating attacks and trading with your opponent.]
;W[ck];B[jq];W[nq]
(;B[oq]C[-- Sure you can play thius, but why not utilize the stones on the right to build a large moyo?  Check out the variation.]
;W[np];B[pn];W[kq]C[-- This is an overplay; Black should know how to punish it.]

(;B[kp]LB[jp:B][kr:A]C[-- The variation you offer (underslide) is a better choice here.  Or simply go to B to make a perfect connection to the left corner stones and still continue the attack (see variation).]
;W[lq]
(;B[jn]LB[jr:A]TR[ck][cn]C[Better at A, I suppose?

-- yes, in this position it is.  Sometimes this jump is much better - trading some of the bottom territory for center influence - but here it doesn't help much.  Now, were those marked stones black, it would have been a different story...]
;W[jr];B[iq];W[ir];B[gq];W[or];B[pr];W[nr];B[cf]LB[fc:A][ch:B]
TR[kd][ck]C[-- slightly better would be at A: now White has an ideal pincer at B (both attacks and makes him six more certain points), which he luckily didn't play.]
;W[fd];B[ci];W[di]LB[ch:A][dh:B][cj:C]C[-- whenever there's a battle starting, the first few moves are critical.  They determine the direction of battle which is much more important than anything else.  Here, for example, Black has these moves avaliable:
- A, to back up and live.  Not good; it gives White a few more forcing moves against this group which will encapsulate it within enemy territory, strengthening White and increasing his influence.
- B, which starts a battle in a very hostile environment.  Not good; White is much more likely to reap benefits from such a fight.  Not only is he a better fighter (by definition) but also he has a few stones nearby, and that is always handy in a close combat situation.
- C, the most powerful move.  See variation.]
(;B[dh];W[ei];B[eh];W[cj]
(;B[bh]C[-- yes, B11 is better both in terms of territory and eye shape.]
;W[ek]
(;B[cc]LB[bc:B][cd:A]C[Here better at A or B?

-- Not a big difference;  I'd go for A because it smells more like finishing in sente than B.]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[ac];W[ce];B[dc];W[ec];B[bb];W[fh];B[ee]
;W[ed];B[fg];W[qh]
(;B[of]LB[oj:A]C[Better at A?

-- actually I'd go for the game move.  A isn't contributing to anything else than this attack, while P14 might as well help a future attack at the top.]
;W[ql]C[-- now this is being unreasonable]
(;B[pl]LB[qm:A]C[-- I'd attack from A and follow by developing the R10.  There's no way White can save both stones.]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[qk]LB[pj:A]C[-- here, go to A to separate White and definitely kill the group or the stone.  You have two targets for attack which means that it doesn't matter if one of them escapes or lives, as long as you don't suffer severe territorial losses and manage to kill the other one.]

(;B[pk]LB[pj:A];W[rj];B[rh];W[ri];B[pj];W[rg];B[rf];W[sh]C[-- an undeserved victory for White]
;B[gg];W[he];B[hi];W[hr]LB[hq:A][gr:B]C[Hmmm... - better for Black here to defend the center at A or confine whiteÂ´s side expansion at B?

-- B is much more prosperous.  If White broke through at A, you can still stop him.  On another note, there really isn't much value in defending the center -- it is of little interest to both players as neither can make anything significant out of it.]

(;B[hq];W[fr]

;W[gl];B[hm];W[ik]
(;B[hk]C[Variation at A - better, or bringing the weak black group around E 13 in danger?

-- see for yourself: if you kept going like you did in the variation, you'd earn at most 5 additional territory points, while said group really needs some tending, and fast :)]

(;B[qc];W[sf];B[rc];W[qe]C[-- too bad, this was a huge loss]

(;B[ob];W[nb]C[-- when it gets to this, you can 99% safely play a hane at O19, have White respond, than connect and let him do so as well.  This kind of a move is most often seen in endgame but it is so big (practically secures you 4 points in sente) that many players play it out immediately.  However, it does mean one less threat in a future ko ;)]

;B[rm];W[df];B[ef];W[cg];B[ch];W[bo];B[bp];W[ap]C[-- another note about a first-line hane.  When you see you opponent play it against your stable group, the only correct answer is a similar move by you.  If you simply answer his move and let him retain sente, you lose four points and let him attack you again.  But if you answered at O19 for instance, you would have symmetrical intrusions going on and you could simply copy White's moves until both intrusions are over, at which point White would still have retained sente, but the score would not have changed.  See variation.]

Black: 65 territories + 4 prisoners = 69
Result: W+1.5

-- Pretty lousy endgame by White.  You've managed to recover more than 20 points during it, according to my counting.  So this comes down to a win by a hair's breadth by White, only because you ran out of places to intrude :)

  All in all, you put up a good fight, with an occasional misdirectioned play here and there.  Try to pause at critical moments (beginning of attack, end of attack) and make some sort of a plan what would you expect to come out of it, then try to direct your opponent's hand towards that goal.  With your yose skills and just a little bit of planning ahead during midgame, I'm sure you'll soon start winning those of your rank on a regular basis.

Have fun! :)
