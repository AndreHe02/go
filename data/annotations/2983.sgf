C[I am black. I played a horrible opening but made up a huge deficit in the middle and end game. B takes one corner and the game by 34.5. I was ready to forfeit several times but perservered.

**** I'm david and currently a 2k on KGS and IGS.  all of my comments will begin with the *****   I focus primarily on the opening since that is what you said you would like help with.]

(;B[eo];W[eq];B[fq];W[er];B[fr];W[gp]C[**** this is a fighting move and a bit greedy for W (in my opinion).  I don't think I would give in so easy.  perhaps try the variation I show.]

(;B[hq];W[dn];B[go]C[***** the problem is that W came out way ahead in this exchange.  W takes a corner and still has nice development potential on the left side.  However, black has played 6 stones that are overconcentrated and secure maybe 2 points of territory?  also, since b ended in gote, w can play a checking move on the bottom side to prevent a black extension.]
;W[kq]LB[pn:B][np:A]C[*** good sense of direction for white.]

(;B[np]C[I was not sure about this O4 approach. Maybe Q6 was better]
;W[no]LB[mo:B][nq:A]C[**** A looks a bit more interesting for W.  potentially gives a big corner to white.  O5 is kind of an odd move in this situation.  I don't see a convincing reason to play this.  I think B would be the best answer.]

(;B[qn]LB[qp:A]C[***** i'm not quite sure what you hoped to accomplish with this move.  in this situation, if i wanted the corner, or to develop on the right side, i think i would choose A.  see the variation.]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[mp]LB[mo:A]C[*** i think this ended up being a very bad exchange for B.  don't be afraid to fight.  I think i would at least try to cross-cut at A and either take some of the side from White, or lock white in.]
;B[nm];W[qf];B[qj]LB[pe:A]C[Maybe R10 was too close to R6

*** yes, way too close.  in general, you want to push the weak stones TOWARD your thickness.  A would be one option  W can still make a base, but you would start working on a moyo on the top side.]
;W[pc];B[pd];W[qd]LB[qb:A]C[I am not sure if I played this corner properly.

**** this is difficult and what I can come to expect from white.  W is playing unusual moves and/or starting fights to keep you off balance.  when you can't read out a cross-cut properly, it is generally a good idea to simply extend the weaker of the two stones.  in this case, a play at A will make it difficult for W to get a good result.]
;B[rd];W[qe];B[oc];W[pb];B[qb];W[ob]C[*** this is going badly for B.]
;B[nc];W[oe]C[**** see the variation for one option.  I don't like the ugly shape B gets when he connects at P16.]

(;B[qp];W[qq];B[qo])
(;B[nn]LB[qp:A]C[*****in my opinion, i think this would be very bad for b.W could either leave this as it is, or take a very secure corner by playing at A.  what does b get in compensation?  not a whole lot since the stone in the upper right corner is on the 3-3 point.  this stone is oriented toward territory, not influence.  so, if i was W, i might try the following:]
;W[pd];B[qd];W[pe];B[pc];W[md];B[rf];W[pj]C[**** now, w has effectively eliminated the influence of the black stones, and it putting some mild attacking pressure on them.B gets a corner, but not one as big as the lower right.]
)))
(;B[cn];W[do];B[dn];W[en];B[fp]C[**** it seems w will have a tough time here.  the corner is still vulnerable and black is not in much danger]
;W[go];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo];W[cr];B[iq]C[**** i think i would be happy with this fight if i was black.  i kept the w group confined to the corner and both of my groups are doing ok.  the w stones in the center still have attacking potential, but they are floating and have no base.]
))
(;B[eq]C[Maybe this variation was better here.


**** according to Ishida, this variations leaves black a little disatisfied.  see comments in this variaiton for an explanation]
;W[eo];B[fo];W[en];B[gp]LB[em:B][fn:A]TR[eo]C[**** this is the proper move for b.  however, it gives sente to white.  in addition, black does not want to play at A because it will induce white B.

also, this same position would arise if W attached at the marked stone, but then black misplayed the joseki.  so, perhaps this would not be the best move.]
