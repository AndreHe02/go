Reviewer's comments are marked "NM". ================================

In the end you notice that white has the whole left side and a huge upper left corner. At what time should I have invaded it? and how?

NM: See my answers at various points - I think the biggest mistake in that respect was B 33, which let W cut and take a big L side.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[ce]C[NM: W C15 is perfectly reasonable, although it invites a double kakari against the D4 stone.]
;B[jc]C[NM: Very good answer - J17 would also have been possible, but any nearer to the W shimari would invite an invasion behind, which would pin a weak black stone between two strong W groups.

Although it leaves a territorial weakness, I would also think of a play here at K16, working to build a big moyo with the three B stones already played .... but it's a matter of taste.]
;W[hc];B[je]C[Is this a good reply?

NM: That is what I would have played. N17 is another possibility, but I don't like it so much, as it leaves W too much moyo-making potential.]
;W[qj];B[qd]C[NM: too defensive. I would first attack the W stone with a pincer.  A trickier question is on which side - my inclination would be R7.  If W plays at R13 or R14, then defend the corner.]
;W[qg]C[NM: Now it look as if R16 should be at R15...];B[dr]
LB[dn:a][cn:b][cj:c][jp:d][qm:e][he:f]C[NM: Too small.  B should be looking at the large open areas on the board. I would prefer any of a-f (more or less in decreasing order).]
;W[cq];B[eo]C[NM: same comment again ...];W[ep];B[fp];W[fo]
C[NM: Not a good cut, because the two groups separated will have no difficulty living, and W is left with a weak group in the centre.  Better to play say D8 or C7 first.]
;B[en];W[go];B[co];W[eq];B[er];W[cr];B[hq]C[NM: Now the W corner group has to  scrabble for life ...]
;W[do];B[dn];W[cn];B[cm];W[bn];B[bm];W[bo];B[gm]C[NM: should be F7 or E8 to prevent  the W cut at D7.]
;W[dm];B[em];W[dl];B[el];W[dk];B[io]C[NM: This pretty well immobilises the two W stones, but I would much prefer a play round K8, capturing them on a larger scale or making them scrabble for life while B both takes territory at the bottom and makes fine influence above. But the mistake at G7 has meant that this whole situation is less good for B than it could have been.]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[NM: Bad. Makes W reinforce his R6 stone and removes the possibility of an invasion at R8. I would prefer R4 or S4 - or even tenuki (maybe H15?)]
;W[pn];B[np]C[NM: O4 does not protect the corner - it aims at attacking the W stones, or building up a moyo with a play around O6. But in this position the W stones  are virtually unattackable; I would  therefore prefer O3 here.]
;W[he]C[NM: Big! It is now difficult to attack the W top left moyo - a reducing move (keshi) looks a lot safer. It's possible that B could still invade, using C10 as a starting point, but it would take a lot of skill to settle such a group. I think that I would now play  F11 or F12 as keshi - if W doesn't reply, then the C10 invasion looks a lot easier.

A more daring possibility would be to  jump into D11 or E13 - or even to try a tsuke attack at B15...]
;B[ek];W[dj];B[fi];W[ej];B[fj]C[NM: This B play achieves a similar result, and is solider; it starts to build a B moyo  - but it's gote.]
;W[of];B[ne];W[nf];B[me];W[mf];B[eg]C[NM: Good!];W[cg];B[mn]
C[NM: Good! Builds up the moyo while putting pressure on the W stones. The game is fairly finely balanced; if B gets a chance to secure the bottom right corner, he seems to be slightly ahead.]
;W[nm];B[mm];W[ml];B[ll];W[lk]C[NM: Looks like a nice double hane, but what if B cuts at O8 (see variation)?]

(;B[mk];W[nl];B[kk];W[lj]
(;B[kl]C[NM: Unnecessarily defensive - the cuts don't seem to bring W much joy (see variation). Therefore L10 would be better - or better yet, S6.]
;W[kj];B[jj];W[op]C[NM: I would just invade at R3 ...];B[oq]
;W[oo];B[ro]C[NM: A bit greedy - surely R3 would be better, when B has two cutting points.]
;W[nq];B[or];W[nr]C[NM: It looks very optimistic to me for W to try and live here - O5 would be  better, or if W really wants to be mischievous, L6 ...]
;B[no];W[nn];B[mo];W[kq];B[mq];W[mr];B[lq];W[lr];B[jr];W[jq]
;B[ir];W[kr];B[hp];W[qq];B[qr]C[What about this?

NM: You clearly have to do something, or W will play Q3. This looks reasonable - but I'm not sure if there might not be a W attack possible. I must admit that I've looked a bit, and don't see any ...]
;W[rr];B[pq];W[qs];B[pr];W[rq];B[po];W[on];B[rs];W[ss];B[rm]
C[NM: I like this move, gaining some liberties and gouging out W territory.]
;W[rn];B[sn];W[rl];B[sq];W[sp];B[rp];W[sr]
(;B[so]C[NM: I prefer T7 here - see the variation. It looks to me as if either way of playing that leads to a bizarre seki in double ko; but the seki is dissolved eventually when the L2 group is taken off the board, and the whole territory becomes B.]
;W[qm];B[sq];W[sm];B[ps];W[eh]
(;B[rs]C[Is this necessary?

NM: No. All that W can do is create the seki/double ko which I showed before (see variation) - and even at that he has to make two approach moves.]
