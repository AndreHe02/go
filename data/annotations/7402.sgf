DanielTom [3d\] on KGS (DT) - Hello Lasse, nice to meet you. I'm your reviewer.

Lasse:
Hi, my name is Lasse and I played Black in this game. I think I played quite well considering my own skills, but I still lost pretty bad.

I would like to know where I made my mistakes (fuseki, joseki, middle-game fighting, endgame, etc.) as well as where my opponent made his mistakes. I will come with a few questions in the game which I hope you can answer for me :).

Besides that, I hope you can tell me where I need to improve my game (fuseki, tesuji, joseki, middle-game fighting, the endgame, ko-fights, sabaki, etc.)

DT - OK, I'll do my best.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[DT - As you know, Black uses this opening when he is looking for influence.
For the record, you can check: http://sanrensei.info/games.html, to see if this fuseki is a good choice for you (it also has some free commented games).]

(;W[pb]LB[pb:A][kd:B][ng:A]TR[ne]SQ[mf]C[Lasse:
I think this is quite a weird move. I see it alot in amateaur play, but practically never in pro play. How can I punish White for making this move?

DT - I can't call it a bad move, actually. It's a joseki. However, looking at the whole board, we can say that it isn't the best move for White. The purpose of the marked stone is to avoid Black having influence in that area (marked with a square). 
Pros don't usually play this move because... see variation (L16 instead of Q18).
The answer to your last question is in the next move.]
(;B[qc]LB[qc:A][ng:A]C[DT - This move is fine. You could also consider A (see variation).]

(;W[qb]LB[qb:A][id:C][le:A]C[DT - This move is a mistake. I am surprised to see a 2 kyu playing this endgame move in the opening (well, not too surprised :p). A instead is the correct move (see variations).]
;B[rb]C[Lasse:
Maybe this move was a waste?
Should I instead have secured my M17 stone?

DT - Yes, this move is just endgame (big, but not to be played yet).
Any move that protects M17 would be better.];W[pc];B[qd];W[od]
LB[jc:A]TR[lc]C[Lasse:

Usually when White plays at R18, he will pincer my stone around A, but he choose not to, so I quickly made my own extension to solidify my group. Was this a mistake on his behalf?

DT - Yes. R18 was bad, to start with. And now you have a free move to protect your marked stone so White's "thickness" is not useful.]

(;B[ic]LB[fc:B][ic:A]C[DT - White's plans aren't working well. 
However, I would perfer to play at F17 instead of J17. Maybe it is just a matter of style.]
;W[gc]C[DT - Good move.];B[le];W[md]LB[ld:A]C[Lasse:
I think this is a somewhat strange move, so I choose to somewhat ignore it and focus on building a moyo. I see he later forced me into a cramped position. Do you have any suggestions to a series of moves instead of the line I choose?

DT - This peep is indeed strange. It only makes Black stronger... You should happily connect at A.]

(;B[ng]LB[ld:B][ng:A]C[DT - I think there is no need to be greedy. See variation.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[jd];W[lf]C[DT - This is not good for Black.]
;B[cf];W[cd];B[ci];W[ck]
(;B[cm]LB[ef:B]SQ[ic][lc][jd][kd][cf][ci]C[Lasse:
I think this move is way too aggresive. I just felt it would be bad if I let him get too big a foothold on the left side of the board, so I played like this, creating 2 weak groups. I know this normally is a bad decision, so I wanted to hear if you have suggestions for alternative moves and why those are better than the one I played?

DT - I understand, but as you say this move was too agressive. As you can see, u now have 3 separated groups... Such thing is to be avoid at all costs.
Because of O13, you are now having many problems. See variation (E14 instead of C7).]

(;W[dm]C[Lasse:
I think the attachment is wrong right? I think normally you play at E9 to threaten both black groups?

DT - Yes. I think White was afraid of White *E9 - Black B9*.]

(;B[dl]LB[dl:A][dn:B]C[DT - This hane is wrong. Should be at D6 (see variation).]
;W[cl];B[cn]
(;W[dk]LB[dk:A][el:B]TR[dl]C[DT - A bad move! The marked stone is captured in a ladder! See variation.]
;B[el];W[ek];B[fl];W[dn];B[co];W[do];B[bq]LB[cp:A]C[DT - I'm not sure, but C4 instead of B3 seems a better shape (less weaknesses).]
;W[cq]
(;B[br]LB[br:A][cr:B]C[Lasse:
Was a play at C2 better?

DT - No, because of the B4 cut (see variation please).];W[bm]
;B[cr]
(;W[cp]LB[cp:A][dr:B]C[DT - This is terrible for White! Of course White should play at D2 instead... see variation.]
;B[eq]C[Lasse:
I choose to give up my 3 stones completely in order to play on a more moyo-orientated basis. Is that wrong?

DT - No, this move (Black's) was a good one.];W[bp];B[jp]LB[je:A]
[ef:C][kf:B]C[Lasse:
When i played the game, I was very happy with this situation. I know I got two weak groups, but I really felt confident in my big moyo. Do you have any thoughts on the current situation?

DT - Its hard to tell. If you could play A (to get out) first, and then play at C to defend your group, you would win the game. But your opponent won't let it happen. So the rest of the game depends on how White can attack your groups.]

(;W[fk]LB[ef:A][fk:A]C[DT - I think this move is too slow. I would play at A instead (see variation).]
;B[jl]TR[cf][ci]C[DT - This move is greedy. I hope you agree with me when I say that defending your weak group is much more important than this.]
;W[mr];B[lr];W[bf]C[DT - This is a mistake. White was probably confused and thought this is a tesuji (the famous tesuji is at B13 instead).]
;B[bg];W[be];B[eg];W[gg];B[fh]C[Lasse:
Was this the best way to make sabaki? I think he could have killed one of my groups somehow, or am I wrong?

DT - This attack could have been a bit more severe indeed.
This is the key point of the game. You should have prevented this attack earlier. As you know, most of the times when there is a double attack, the one being attacked loses. White is starting a double attack so this is a hard game for you. You can get killed (hopefully not!) and while your opponent is attacking you, he can invade your moyo.
I dare to say that you main mistake in this game was not defending your group before this attack.]
;W[gh];B[gi];W[fi];B[gf]C[DT - This is a strange move.];W[hf]
;B[ei];W[fj];B[fg];W[ge];B[dh]TR[ic][lc][jd][kd]C[DT - There were many variations and I decided not to show them because it would be confusing. Anyway, you lived but in gote, as expected, and now White has a wall facing the center. Even more important, your marked group is not alive yet.]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[mb];B[lb];W[kb];B[jb];W[la];B[kc];W[ka];B[jf]
C[Lasse:
Is there another way to make life here? I felt that a move at K15 also could have made life somehow?

DT - I think this is the only way of getting out.];W[kf];B[if]

;W[bh];B[cg];W[bi];B[ch];W[cj];B[ah];W[bj];B[ej]C[DT - Black is alive and White has to invade your moyo in order to win.]
;W[gq]C[DT - This is the correct shape point to explore your weakness.]
;B[fp];W[gp];B[fo];W[go];B[gn]C[Lasse:
Was this an overplay?

(;B[lm]LB[lm:A][hr:A]C[Lasse:
I was not sure where to play, so I choose this attack. Is there a better way to attack the white group?

DT - A (H2) is the vital point but if you play it now the result is unpredictable. See variation.]
;W[km];B[kl];W[jm]
(;B[kn]LB[il:A][kn:A]C[DT - No need to play here. Simply connect at A. See variation.]
;W[jn];B[hm]C[Lasse:
I think a move at J8 would have been better right?

DT - Yes.];W[ln]
(;B[lo]LB[mm:B][lo:A]C[Lasse: I am being ultra aggresive right now. Is there another way for me to play here?

DT - You don't need to kill White. I would just play at N7, White would still need extra moves to live, and then you could play one more move to defend your moyo. Even if White lives, you would still win by about 10 points.]
;W[ik];B[il];W[ll];B[mm];W[lk];B[mn];W[kk]C[Lasse:
I think White made a mistake here. Would he have won if he had played around J2 or J3 instead?

DT - White was trying to capture you, so he was preventing L10.]

;B[in];W[jk];B[gr];W[fm];B[kn]C[DT - This is a bad move (and we can call it the losing move). There is no need to play here (Black is alive anyway in double ko). Instead, you should expand-while-defending your moyo.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[ph]C[DT - White is far behind so he has to invade.]

(;B[oi]LB[oh:B][oi:A]C[DT - I am not sure. but I think P12 instead would kill White.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[qi]C[Lasse:
I could not find a way to kill it. Is there any chance for me to destroy this invasion?

DT - See the last comment (move 177). In this position, because of the bad aji, it seems hard to kill White.]
;B[rk];W[of];B[og];W[pg];B[qf];W[oh];B[nh];W[ni];B[nj];W[mi]
;B[qh]TR[ng][og][nh]C[DT - This move obviously doesn't work but anyway the marked stones are captured.]

Was this the right end-game choice? I am thinking now that it might be bigger to play at N19 or F15?

Lasse:
I've gotten behind by 1 point + komi, but I still can't figure out so many places where I made big mistakes that cost me that many points. If it is in the fuseki, middle-game, or in the endgame. Hope you can help me :)

Thankyou in advance for reviewing my game. It is greatly appreciated!


DT - In the end, you lost because of the A invasion. That invasion could, of course, be avoided if you didn't play L6 (that was useless).

However, I'm am more concerned with your priorities in a go game: you didn't defend the marked groups when you should (and that is the main lesson you can take from this game), which had bad consequences (a double-attack). As you know, one should always avoid having weak groups. This leads me to my first and most important advice: 

1. Play urgent points before big points;

This is a very basic one, but it's good not only to know it, but to put it into practise. It is related to the go proverb: "don't go fishing while your house is on fire".

Tennuki is good, but you should answer your opponent's moves when they can put in danger your stones. In the game, if the move 21 was played at M16, you wouldn't have the problem of having weak groups. So my next advice is also a basic one, but it is very important to keep it in mind:

2. "Even a moron connects against a peep" (this is a tactics proverb);

Also, next time try to avoid moves like S18:

3. Save endgame moves to the endgame;

Finally, although you played some good reading sequences, you still need to train your reading (like move 33, where both players missed a ladder - this reminds me of a go proverb: "If you don't know ladders, don't play go" :))

Your endgame skills are good for your level.

Just keep playing and soon you'll become stronger. It is always good if you can read one or two good go books (like Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go and Attack and Defense), and watch some pro games. I am really sorry if I made any mistakes in this review. Hopefully you will improve after reading it :) Any reader can contact me (danielfacto@gmail.com) to leave comments or questions.

I wish you the best of luck.

See you around. :)])
