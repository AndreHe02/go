C[Hi,

I think I started well but then I was invaded and didn't know how to handle it. I think that maybe I should have reinforced the north so that I could lead the invasion (141)to it. Or attack earlier the weak east black group

Thanks for the review

Tuomas:
Hiya, I am Tuomas from Finland. Something like 4 kuy I think.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[cd];B[dc]LB[ec:1][jd:2]C[Tuomas:
This exchange is interesting. 

First when white plays C16 he really invites black to develop the Q16 stone and build huge framework. If your opponent likes to play with frameworks and you hate to play against them then this white stone was a mistake.

However the way black approaches white corner seems bad. So lets see how white can punish black form his mistake.]
;W[dd];B[ec]LB[de:1]C[Tuomas:
First this seemed nice move for me but now I am starting to think that perhaps White should play more passively here. The wall that white gets is nice but the problem is that then white has to commit to defend and develop this wall on the left side. That forces white to play many stones in relatively small area while black gets to extend his influence around the board.

For example '1' could work. It puts pressure on black stone and leaves more choises for white for his next move. I think white can play it and then after black defends white can already play elsewhere.]
;W[fe];B[cc];W[dj]LB[ed:1][dj:2][jp:3]C[I tried to do a san ran sei for white, but I don't know if it is a good idea.

Tuomas:
White should not ignore black here. Now black 1 can cut white shape. White can play 1 which should be sente. D10 itself is good direction. White has to play it now that he has made this wall. And after that white desperatelly needs to expand his corner towards K4.

Can you see how the decision to make a wall commits white to play only on this side of the board?]
(;B[gc];W[fq]LB[jp:1]C[Tuomas:
White has now ignored two black stones in upper left corner. That should always warn you that you are about to take some damage in that area. And if you look at the board you can also ask if white can afford to take damage in that area.

This stone that white placed in F3 is too slow but it does have the correct direction. It does give white very solid formation to the left side, only weakened by the cut in upper left corner. However who is now committed to a framework game plan with large moyos. And in that sense this stone is too slow. Black can now win game without invading that left side. Just by making territory. So now white must play closer to K4 to stay in the game.]
;B[cp]C[Tuomas:
Moyo frameworks look intimidating but they tend to shrink a lot during the game. The worst thing black can now do is invade too early. Black should play his own game, making territory while constraining the growth of this area. It takes some guts to starte huge framework like that but that is the only way.]
;W[co];B[cq];W[bo];B[dq];W[ep];B[eq]
(;W[fo]LB[do:2][fp:1]C[Tuomas:
F4 is better. White can capture black cut at 2 with geta.];B[fr]
;W[gq];B[gr]TR[pd][pp]C[Tuomas:
Black gained few points while making white framework even more potent. And now white influence is spreading towards center and is starting to hurt black hoshi stones.  White is back in game.]
;W[bq]LB[hq:1]C[Tuomas:
This is not significant. White should move on to interfere the black formation on the right side. White 1 is better. It could also be a good moment to take sente and attack the black formation on the right side.]
;B[br];W[bp];B[hq]LB[hq:3][pq:2][qq:1]TR[pp]C[Tuomas:
This is one of the big points to get. White should have taken this point instead of placing a stone at B3. Black would have to live in the corner and white would inflict serious damage in the low right corner.

Yes hoshi stones do have so wide range, they are easily affected by something that happens on the other side of the board. Simple way to visualize this is to imagine san-san invasion at R3 and how the board looks after black blocks it from Q3. The color of H3 stone makes huge difference.]
;W[go]C[Tuomas:
Bad move, too slow and inefficient. Is this even necessary? What does this stone do?]
;B[ho];W[hn];B[io]TR[hq]C[Tuomas:
See how black influence on lower right side is now building very fast. Of course white also gainst here but black is winning. Again observe how H3 was the key, way more valuable than B3. The black there is already competing with white left side in terms of size.]
;W[qn]LB[np:1]C[Tuomas:
This is the first stone that is not placed on the left side. I believe this is good enough move in this situation. Black can now easily take the bottom side with 1. I don't think he needs to do anything else to still be on the winning track. White can't really afford to play much more aggressively than this.]
;B[qo]LB[pj:1]TR[pd]C[For me it was too close, but I don't know how to handle it. More used to 03.

Tuomas:
This is a standard joseki that is played to prevent corner invasion. The trade off is that white gets strong position to the right side. If black has a stone at 1 this is excellent choise. However now this joseki will hurt the other black hoshi stone at Q16. See variation for standard sequence.]
(;W[nq]C[Tuomas:
White should not enter here, it is way too dangerous in here without support from central influence. Even if white lives black will gain lot of territory and can hold initiative for long time after this.]

LB[ko:1]TR[hn][mo]C[Tuomas:
White 1 could work better as it also protects the N5 cut and might connect to H6 stone perfecting a huge wall for white.]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[ks];W[on];B[pn];W[pm];B[rn];W[qm];B[rm];W[rl]
LB[pg:5][ql:3][in:4][ko:1][mo:2]TR[jp][kq][ir][jr]C[Black can cut (and did it) but it looked not a good point. But he succeed to live to maybe R8 was better (but then when to stop. Or maybe jump to R9?

Tuomas:
White got ultimate result from this fight. White outwitted black by clear margin here. Black was restricted to the corner and white got a wall. White needs to keep eye for some weak points in this wall though. White should be prepared to sacrifice marked stones.

S8 adds a weakness so it is a bad move. R8 is ugly and slow and vulnerable and horrible shape (please excuse my harsh words :-)). R9 is better but with this many stones in a wall white would really want to play somewhere around Q13. However I fear that the white wall is too vulnerable for such plays. And if white uses time to fix the wall then black gets chance to negate it by playing somewhere near 5.]
;B[ql]LB[ph:1][jn:2]C[Tuomas:
Attacking like this is not that good plan. Black could place a stone somewhere around 1. This builds his corner and reduces the value of the white wall. Black should not play on the third line because white would instantly move to contain him with shoulder hit. It is now game of influence so black has to remain on fourth line.

Note that the breach in white walls at 2 is huge. White can easily seal it by sacrificing stones from bottom side. However if black can develop the upper right corner white framework might not be big enough to do so big sacrifice.]
;W[rk]LB[pl:1]C[Tuomas:
This stone is nothing, just play 1 to be safe. Black gets something like 10 points on the side while white keeps his wall active.]
;B[pl];W[om];B[pj]TR[rk][rl]C[Tuomas:
White got cut for nothing. This is good time to forget marked stones and try something else.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[qf]TR[qj][rk][rl]C[Tuomas:
This is basically ok idea, but by adding extra stones to his group at R10 white made black stronger so now this is more dangerous. Also this will easily lead to a fight where white has to run to center while black builds territory on top. Running to center like that will let black to enter white framework and ruin points that white has there.]
;B[ol]LB[nd:1][qe:2]C[Tuomas:
Ignoring an approach to upper right corner is dangerous. Also this is bad shape. Perhaps 1 or 2 and wait to see what white is up to.]
;W[ln]LB[pk:2][jn:1]C[Tuomas:
White takes action to keep this group alive, but it can't be called as a wall anymore. The objectives for black are to keep the breach at 1 open and to support the group 2. White group is now too strong so you can't bet the game on being able to kill it. The black problem howewer is that he also needs to do something to the upper right corner.]
;B[ml]C[Tuomas:
Good direction, supports the weakest black group while keeping the presure on white.]
;W[qh]C[Tuomas:
This is slow but now white is strong in here. Now black can't press against this group anymore. Black center group is now vulnerable. And the black top corner is under heavy attack.]
;B[ph];W[pg];B[oh];W[qd]LB[nc:2][rd:1]C[Tuomas:
Payback time for black for ignoring the white. However this is not the best move to take profit for white. The rule of thumb is that when you touch opponent stone, it becomes stronger. This is what happens also here.

I would start by considering 1 and 2.];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc];W[pc]
LB[hd:1]C[Tuomas:
Overplay. Entering the upper side doesn't seem so interesting for white. Perhaps he could just play like 1 to keep black pressed on the third line. It also has nice effect to the white center influence.]

C[Tuomas:
Very good result for white. The way this sequence ends by putting more presure on black center group is great. If white didn't have weak points in his upper left and bottom right corner groups I would put my money on white vectory without doubt.]
;B[mi];W[li]C[I was quite happy to be able to do double hane, but even if I captured the 3 stones, black is connected so not sure it was a good idea at the end. M12 was maybe a better idea.

Tuomas:
This is very good place to use double hane. Black to live or lose.]
;B[lh];W[mg];B[lj];W[ni]LB[ki:1][kj:2]C[Tuomas:
There is a saying about how ponnuki, the start is worth 30 points. Black should not go for the double hane effect now. Extend with L11 to prevent ponnuki. Then say black plays here to prevent this move. Then white can turn and play L10.

If you consider that result to playing M12 you see how much better this would be. There is actually a potential captive from black at the M12 spot.

Observe how powerfull the ponnuki is during rest of the game.]
;B[ki];W[pi];B[nj];W[oj];B[ok];W[oi];B[nl]C[Tuomas:
Black lost few points but got very nice shape to center. White will have now very hard time to make points in center.]
;W[in]TR[hk][ik][jk][hl][il][jl][hm][im][jm]C[Tuomas:
White the strong black group this wall has very little value left. There won't be many points for white at market area. Black can throw one stone somewhere on that area and it is black who is making points there.]
;B[jo];W[jn];B[ko];W[kn];B[lo];W[mo];B[kp];W[hp];B[jq];W[ip]
;B[kq];W[iq]C[Tuomas:
Nice defence from white, I expected much more damage. In the end this whole sequence was only worth few points.]
;B[dl]LB[ck:2][ek:1]TR[lh][ki][mi][lj]C[This was abusive to me but was not able to handle it.

Tuomas:
The black group in the center, the ponnuki if you wish, makes all the difference. The basic way to kill would be to prevent black from making a base and the pressing it against the white wall. Now the black ponnuki is most likely enough to keep black alive.

The basic killing moves are 1 and 2. First prevents connection outside but leaves more space for making a base. Second takes out the base but leaves a running group. I usually choose to give opponents a running group because you get to control the flow of the game that way. It also gives you some points.]
;W[fl]LB[ek:1]C[Tuomas:
This is a bad move for this purpose. This kind of jump is actually used as escaping move, it is very flexible and light. In this case it allows black to push straight through it and doesn't prevent black making eyes either.]
;B[dn];W[do];B[ek]LB[ed:2][dj:1][gm:3]C[Tuomas:
Black took the key point for running. Now white actually has to be defensive so that D10 doesn't get in trouble. Also remember the cut in upper left corner. Also keep eye on the peep at 3 during the fight.]
;W[fi];B[ej];W[ei]C[Tuomas:
Few standard twicks to consider in this kind of situation in variations.]
(;B[fk];W[hj];B[hk];W[ik];B[gl];W[hl];B[fm];W[gk];B[gm];W[gn]
;B[hm]C[Tuomas:
This kind of push is worse than useless. Black loses one outside liberty and does not change the connection between white groups in any way.]
;W[im];B[en];W[eo];B[cj]C[Tuomas:

Tuomas:
This is always the trouble of end game, you need to be really carefull when you let your group lose outside liberties. When opponent only has one eye, you only need to connect your cutting stones.]
;W[mk];B[nk];W[kl];B[km];W[il];B[ll]C[Tuomas:

C[Tuomas:
This move is aji-keshi. Black wastes future opportunities. It is unlikely that black would want to play this atari from this side. Playing it from G13 gives him follow up atari for later ko-fights for example.]

Good end-game sente.];W[ee];B[lm]C[Tuomas:
This is dame, well you could call it as 0pt reverse sente so this could be used during 0.5 point ko fight. Not now.]

(;B[mf];W[cr];B[nf];W[ds];B[gp];W[fp];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[gs]
C[Tuomas:
Time for the end game, lets see what white has:

F6, 1pt sente
L14, 1.5 reverse-sente
R9, 1pt reverse sente
T16, 1pt reverse sente
J16, 1pt reverse sente
C6, 1pt reverse sente
D19, 1pt reverse sente (could be argued as gote also)
T6, 1pt gote
A12, 1pt gote
A8, 1pt gote

White doesn't have much to play with. However since it is black turn it is expected that he gets to play all those reverse sente moves as sente for him. And then he can choose one gote. Score estimate is now B+5.5 so we can expect it to be B+12.5 when White next gets to choose what he does.

Black starts the end game nicely but then he starts to try too fancy things. See variation for sente-first style end game.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[id];W[ie]
(;B[be]C[Tuomas:
Oops, black is deviating from the plan. Check the variation. However this is probably just zero sum unless black looses sente here or actually kills something.]
;W[cf]LB[da:1]C[Tuomas:
This sequence effectively turns black D19 into a sente. If white plays C15 instead here D19 doesn't become sente. That is potentially one point.]
;B[bd];W[ad];B[ab];W[ac];B[ae];W[bb];B[da];W[ce]C[Tuomas:
White should play A14 because it then white would gain one extra 1pt sente if black stops the sequence here.]
;B[ca]C[Tuomas:
Black plays dame that gives white a sente move.];W[af]C[Tuomas:
White should thank black for giving him A14 stone. Now white gets A12 push in sente.]
;B[ah]LB[qk:1]C[Tuomas: 
Black plays reverse sente that he just gave white. So black got some extra stuff with sente in upper corner but lost sente here. I guess the only mistake is that black did not play R9 before this adventure.]
;W[sc]LB[cn:2][fn:1]C[Tuomas:
Mistake, this is a gote move. White should play his sente first and then choose the reverse sente instead of this.]

First thing to study for white is good shape and strong groups. White left several weak groups behind that forced him to be slow and defensive when he should have been taking offence. This study follows every go player through their game career but in this game it really was holding white back in some occasions.

White seems to have tendency to take walls and build influence. That is allright. However white should study more how to use the influence. Big part of that is preparing to give up small territories on sides and few stones as captives if it means you get to complete the moyo.

White seems to also have a habit of getting caught in the melee. Example is the double hane situation where white fought too deep. Here the frenzy took over and white actually forced black to make a ponnuki, the perfect shape to fight against white influence. Keep your eyes open and learn to stand back from the melee fight when it is time for it.

I have been on hiatus from go for a while but this game was very fun to review. I seriously need to dust of my go board!]
