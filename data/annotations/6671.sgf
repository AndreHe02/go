AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[Hi there, sorry this review may seem a bit sparse. I cant figure out how to access the teaching tools and I havent played go for awhile. I hope you still find my insights valuable.

Cheers.
Josh.];W[nc];B[kd];W[qf];B[oe]C[Maybe O17 better?

O17 is a bit better, but for your level of play this is just fine]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qd]C[This is an equal exchange. Given all your extra stones playing solid equil exchange is wise.]
;B[og]C[I don't know if this one is good.. is it? alternatives?

There are definitly bigger better moves.

k4, and any extention off of one of our hoshi stones would be great.]
;W[fq];B[ip]C[Im not sure about playing this high pincer. If you dont know the joseki, dont play it.]
;W[fo];B[dn];W[np];B[qn];W[pq];B[qq];W[oq];B[qr]C[I would have played R4 here]
;W[in]C[YOu cant leave this stone hanging. Its in great danger. There is plently of room to build a base and you can still escape. Letting your opponet have a commanding presense in any area of a handicap game brings doom.]
;B[fc];W[cd];B[cc]C[I don't like the result at this corner .. :(

No you dont. See var];W[bc];B[bd];W[ce]
(;B[dc];W[bb];B[ko]C[Playing to build a base at M3 also threatens whites p3 group. This move only escapes]
;W[nn];B[km];W[jo];B[kp];W[jp];B[jq]C[YOu found out why this move is no good. WOuld have been better to just come down and push a bit into white territory letting the J4 stone go]
;W[kq];B[lq];W[kr];B[lr];W[jr];B[mo];W[no];B[ns]C[THis is a fruitless move. Your group is in no danger so there is no need to connect. There is no eye space for white so your not distroying his base.
 You should have attacked the white group from above instead]
;W[iq];B[nl];W[pl];B[om];W[ok];B[pm];W[ql];B[oj]C[If you want to catch this hite group that move is no way to do it. And with whites R14 stone in your base trying to make a base is futile. However this is a good move because it helps you keep center influence which is needed here. Just becareful about WHY your make your moves.]

;W[ns];B[nq];W[dl];B[cl]C[I want to see variations of this, because I don't like the result :(

No offence, but you can play the variations yourself. Your problem was making this move in the first place. Better to extend your group towards the corner with D2 or try to build a base with c13.]

;W[bk];B[kj];W[rj]C[Its too bad white had this spectacular move...I didnt see it either]

C[Also I don't like the result of this.. Variations?

This part of the board was played poorly by both of you. I dont understand why your not happy with the result. You took the entire top side, and killed a bunch of whites stones in the process.]

;B[me];W[li];B[lh];W[ki];B[mi];W[jg];B[mj]C[You misread whites intention here. Its obvious that the S10 group will live. You already cut off the white stones  connection to this group so this move is useless. Then you got punished and lost a great deal of  the value you made on the top side.]

;W[ef];B[ff];W[eg];B[jl]C[Not sure what this move is about at all.]
;W[fg];B[hl]C[again...what are you hoping to accomplish here?]
;W[cq]C[Big..

Huge, this was one of the areas you should have taken instead of those doubious moves you played the previous 2 truns]

Im sorry I didnt have the energy to give a more constructive review. I hope you find my comments helpful. Its great that you love go so much that you have people review your games. If you found any of my comments too negitive, dont let it get you down. I just didnt have the energy for being more constructive.
Good luck with your games and developing your style.
