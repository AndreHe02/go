(;B[cf]C[This is an odd response.  When White appoaches the 4-4 stone on the third line then black responding on the 3rd line emphasises territory, while answering on the 4th line emphasises attack.   But when white approaces high there is no reason to play low.  White can't invade the corner easily and the high response is really the only move this early in the game.]

(;B[ip]C[Interesting move.  If I'm white, I'd be thinking Black is nervous.  He's trying to reduce terrority he thinks is mine already.  It's not yet, but blacks plays are going to help me get territory on the bottom and leave weakness for me to exploit later.]
;W[hp]C[White resisting in this manner does not seem like a good plan.  Just take the territory on the bottom and don't force Black to strengthen his stones in the corner.]

(;B[cq]C[Bad Move Black.  How much territory did you get in Gote?  If White attacked the corner you'd probably get just as much.  Better to have attacked White while you had the chance.]
;W[fl];B[hl]C[What is the black stone doing?  Taking territory? Driving white in a direction that black wants him to go?  This is not a good move.  C9 is better -- It takes territory on the side, and takes white base away on the side.  White is obligated to run out into the middle.  An attack move that also take territory.

Another alternative is to just ignore it and play elsewhere.  H17 looks good for Black.]

(;B[ge]LB[fc:A]C[A: Would 66 at A have been better? I felt on reflection that
this is where I lost the top territory.

An odd question.  What top territory did Black have up here to lose?  this move only gave White territory on the top side]

(;B[on]C[I can't tell what this is attacking.  It is Aji Keshi -- It takes potential away.  O4 has potential.  There is a cut at M4 and K4 that O4 makes possible.  By killing O4, the possiblity of cutting might be lost.]

LB[oi:A]C[D: Should black have played on outside at A?

R13 is doing nothing for black.   Black shouldn't have played P12. but since he did he should still back off to R10 once he realizes his mistake.  white still has to run.]
;W[oi];B[og];W[qj]C[Now you should see why R10 is bigger.  It protects Blacks side territory and it stops white from making a base.]

There is nothing to gain in the center.  This is mostly end game plays now.  Black can reduce white territory at to the top and bottom, and might be able to chase G11 white stones.
