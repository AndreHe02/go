;B[pd]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over my game. It was a complicated and reasonably close game until the very end, involving quite a lot of ko; I hope you don't find it too complicated to review. Sure enaugh I didn't quite know what was going on for most of the game. In the opening my opponent played very agressively and I didn't manage to punish his overplays. Later in the game this pattern continued, with both of us fighting over the life of basically every group on the board. The main points I want to ask about, as well as my thoughts on most of the moves will be included as comments. Please try to validate or correct those thoughts, since that is the way I would improve, while avoiding long complicated variations, except in the opening. Also please try to point out typical shapes and the plans, ideas or expectations attached to each suggested move. I'm very much looking forward to learn from your experience.


T: Hi, I am Tilwen, my comments will start with "T:". It is interesting that you put lots of variations. My feeling looking at them though is that you don't have a very nice idea of your moves (lots of time you write "I made a terrible move here"), and the same about your opponent's moves. But remember that go is a complex game and that it is often very hard to know if a move is good or bad. Sometimes it is obvious, but most of the time one can find out only playing the game and realizing about the bad aji or the weaknesses that were left.

 Anyway, I will try to answer your questions.];W[dp];B[qp];W[op]
C[This is what I've been trying recently. Might be slightly fancy, but I don't like playing against orthodox (or any other fuseki), I guess. Shouldn't be too unreasonable. Usually (variation) black would attach underneath, I would play hane on the outside and then when black responds tenuki to take the remaining corner. Not sure how good that exchange is but it has been played by pros (albeit not many...)
Maybe approaching low instead is more fitting to this kind of idea?


T: I have this feeling from time to time. At this point of the game, it is perfecly playable (maybe a pro would not play it but you know, we are not pro).]

(;B[pn]C[I don't really understand this move. Is it more certain to get sente than the other choices? I try to play normal.

T: This move is joseki when there is a black stone around K4, usually it is an attacking move. Here what you play is just fine.]
;W[qq];B[pp]C[But this move I've never seen before.

T: Looks like bad for me, but the result is about even (rather good for White).]
;W[pq];B[oq]C[And here I start reading for a while what happens after I play O4, decide that I would die and let black trick me by sealing me in in exchange for that one stone.]

(;W[nq]C[T: This is correct.];B[or];W[nr];B[oo];W[np];B[rq]
;W[pr];B[qr];W[os]C[T: Up to here, the result is rather good for White (I would say even at our levels): Black has a small corner and a bit of influence, White captured two stones and have influence also, he looke a bit more solid.]
;B[rr]C[This move is slow I think. Black should take the open corner.

T: Agreed. And now as White I wonder if I would take the empty corner or start a moyo with C6. I guess both are OK.]
;W[dd]C[Which I do instead of him. Locally it's still an amazing result for black though, which means I let myself get tricked.

T: Not at all an amazing result: Black has about 10 points + influence, White has 4 points + influence + sente. Right now Black has about 6 points more on the board, you have one more corner.]
;B[fq]C[Black's style is to have a lot of fighting and dying rather than large moyos. Here I decide to pincer him to make a few points on the bottom but maybe that's not a good idea. Not sure what to do.]
;W[hq]C[T: O3 is far so this pincer looks very nice.]
(;B[fo]C[Didn't expect black to do this.];W[dn];B[jq]C[Never seen this before. It seems like an overplay, but hard to deal with.

T: Looks like an over play to me too. In this shape you can jump I think (see variation).]

(;W[ip]C[I play the most severe move I can think of to split and attack both groups.]

(;B[ko]C[Black plays lightly, again unexpected. Wonder what I should do if he just extends up.]

(;W[in];B[mo];W[no]C[T: This seems crude to me, I don't really think the cut will be favorable for you. What about D2 here ? Or maybe P2 needs to live first, but then the cut at O5 is a bad aji for Black.]
;B[nn];W[mn]C[I'm not actually trying to kill black, but I want him to be running up the board, so I cut here.]
;B[lo];W[nm]C[T: N6 instead looks like better shape, not so sure.]
;B[on]C[Not sure what the best shape here would be.];W[lm]C[T: This looks like you can't really do a better shape. Your lower group has been enclosed but it should live, and on an other hand Black has two weak groups.]
;B[km];W[ll];B[kl];W[jn]C[T: Seems like aji-keshi. Of course Black will answer but maybe later you would have needed M6 to get an eye for instance.]
;B[kn];W[lk];B[lr]C[Here comes an unpleasant surprise. I hadn't considered the possibility of my poor tricked group dying after capturing a stone. Right now there is a way to save it thought, which is what I do.

T: Yes, right now it is alive I think.]
(;W[mr]C[Low and behold, black is very honest and actually plays N1 to take away the eye. I think this is a mistake. He should play some different move forcing me to go back and make the eye instead.

T: Now Black has M3 in sente, it feels painful.]
(;B[ms];W[lq]C[Black sees that he can't kill me outright and plays another move that's very hard to deal with.]

(;B[hr]C[Here I make a mistake. Somewhat upset that I don't get to separate black, which means already that the game is pretty much lost, I try to have everything and end up dying. In fact this might even be the correct way to play though, I'm not sure. Just living seems awfull.]

(;W[gr]C[So I play this then, not actually thinking that I have to sacrifice the P1 group. As I said, even so this might be the right idea...]
;B[gq];W[ir]
(;B[iq]C[I didn't expect this move. Thought black would play H4 as in the variation...]
;W[hp];B[jr]C[Now I realize that I'm about to die in both places... L2 right now leads to ko, which is a terrible result. So I play H1 instead.]

(;W[hs];B[kq]C[And I'm dead. Now I hope to kill black on the left taking a big corner as compensation. Still, black has a big lead.

T: The O2 group still has aji and Black's group is very weak, not to mention the F5 stones, floating in the middle of nowhere. I think the game is playable.]

(;W[fm];B[gn];W[gm];B[dq]C[black will try to live. I was slightly surprised.

T: There is aji. At least Black could have lived at the 3-3 point. Now, I don't know :-) .]
;W[cq];B[cr]C[Here I made a mistake. I should just connect everything solidly, since black can't start a capturing race with my middle group which is out and has an eye. However I try to end this nonsense right away.

T: Agreed (see variation).]
(;W[dr]
(;B[ep]C[T: Black should protect.];W[eq];B[do];W[co];B[en]C[Black thinks he can ge a ko. I don't think this is one.]
;W[em];B[hm];W[hn];B[bp]C[Here I was seriously considering tenuki, since I thought black was just dead and that's that... maybe I'm underestimating the aji black has here. In any case, in the game I did respond by taking the ko.

T: What about the atari at F6 if you want to be sure ?];W[eo]
;B[ml]C[This is actually meant as a ko threat by black, which I only realized when he took back the ko. In the game I thought this was a really strange move and turned in the center, basically claiming that this is too slow for black and not a good way to attack my weak group there.]
;W[kk];B[do]C[I was really surprised here. Maybe I blundered on this move now: I played D7 hoping to fix the aji in the most efficient way. That might be too greedy though.]

(;W[dm]C[T: I would connect at C4 instead (or again, atari at F6).]
;B[cp]C[Now I get slightly scared. Black is about to make life, it seems.

T: I understand your feeling, it is hard in this condition to play accurately.]
;W[eo];B[mm]C[Here however, when I definetly shouldn't connect M6, I decide that even if this is ko, I have so many threats that Capturing the N7 stones in a ladder later would be helpfull to secure my weak stick in the center. This is most likely another blunder.]
;W[ln]C[T: This is big.];B[do];W[dq]C[I somewhat still don't believe this is actually ko...]
;B[cn]C[But after this move it seems to be. In any case, I couldn't read out the life and death situation after I play F2 here. In retrospect that doesn't seem to work.]

(;W[eo];B[jk]C[And after becoming rather scared of black living in my corner after all I just capture the ko without even making use of my threats that I can get by threatening to live with my bottom right group.]
;W[fn];B[mk]C[Now I wonder what I should do here. In the game trying to run out that stick didn't seem reasonable to me.I wonder if it is? During the game I was expecting to get some free moves in the middle by threatening to start a capturing race between black's middle group and my right group. Here I give up on that hope.

T: Your 6 stones are big, for two reasons: first there are 6 stones, and second they cut the right alive black group from the left not alive Black group. When you sacrifice then Black has no problem anymore.]
;W[qj]C[I wonder if this is a mistake. In any case, I'm in a very desperate position here.

T: Looks like an overplay, you put a stone in a Black forest.]
;B[kj]C[Black really wants those stones right now.];W[qf]C[This might be an overplay? Luckily black thought this was a ladderbreaker. I wasn't actually going to run those stones out... maybe I could try that?

T: Even with your three moves, game is now hard for White.]
;B[lj];W[rd]C[This move is wrong. I was hoping for black to respond with 3-3 and make the "good" invasion shape with Q12, however this move is still wrong. I don't know what would be better. Maybe Q12 right away?

T: This looks locally OK to me.];B[qh]C[Absolutely no idea what to do here.

T: Complicated to answer. But do you really want to save R10 ? Black lower group is already very strong so that taking R10 is only about points. What about 3-3 and then get profit in the upper area if Black takes R10 ?]

(;W[rh];B[rg];W[qg];B[ri];W[ph];B[qi];W[pi];B[rf]C[Again here, no idea what to do. This seems like a really terrible position for white.]

(;W[rj]C[T: This atari seems wrong to me, because saving S16 will be more important than saving R10. Moreover, S12 had aji.]
;B[sh];W[re]
(;B[sf]C[T: Black is too nice.]
(;W[pk]SQ[rl][qm][rn]C[I defend this side rather than the top because I'm afraid black will get a lot of points after capturing my R10 stones... in any case it's a very bad result.

T: Here you have a bad positionnal judgement. Black is already strong in the squared area, so that taking a couple more stones will only give him a few more points.
But on the upper right corner, Black has only one stone, rather weak because of White's wall. The right move here is to connect the cut at R15 (see variation).

There is a proverb saying "urgent move before big moves". The cut at Q10 is big (Black gets decent points if he plays here), but playing on the upper side is urgent (Black stone at Q16 stays weak while you make your group strong).]
;B[qe];W[of]C[another bad move. Doesn't actually defend the cut at Q13, as I'm about to find out...

T: Game looks over here.];B[pc]C[Slow move by black.];W[pe]
;B[qd];W[jc]C[Shouln't have done that... I was desperate to make up the big lead that black had and didn't consider the cut...]
;B[pg]C[It seems like I have to sacrifice.];W[og];B[pf]C[Now I'm worried about life again... However I play the wrong move to try and live.]
;W[rm];B[oh]C[black cuts me again and I have to sacrifice once more.]
;W[oi];B[nh];W[ni];B[oe]C[not a good move, lets me come out.]
;W[mh];B[ng];W[mg];B[nf];W[mi]C[This is fairly resignable...]
;B[fc]C[black plays on in the same style.];W[ec];B[fd];W[df]
;B[ch];W[cj];B[di];W[hd]C[bad move by me. Maybe taking N17 or Playing something like F14 is good?

T: Looks OK, you need to be very active and kill something.]
;B[lc];W[fb]C[again wrong move. I need to split and attack, not secure my corner.

T: Yes, something like G14 or F13 looks  more interesting.]
;B[gb];W[eb];B[hc];W[je]C[Now it's me who's getting attacked, as always in this game.]
;B[ic];W[id];B[jb];W[gd];B[gc];W[kc];B[kb];W[fe];B[ee]C[Didn't expect this move. Once again, I'm fairly sure my reaction was wrong.]
;W[ff];B[ef];W[eg];B[de]C[Wonder if I can cut here... couldn't quite read that in the game.]

(;W[ce];B[ed]C[Now the big question where to fix...];W[cc]C[I want my corner to live...]
;B[dg]C[Unexpected. I think black should cut at F13.];W[cf]
;B[eh]C[once again, I think this is a mistake by black.];W[fg]
;B[dk];W[ck];B[gh];W[fh];B[fi]C[Here the cut is probably an overplay but I thought I had to kill black to win.]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[hi];B[fj];W[hj];B[hk]C[Here I realize that I can't kill him and go back to fixing my shape in the middle in the most greedy ("efficient") way possible.]
;W[jh];B[kh];W[kg]C[the hane was a bad idea... I was afraid of my right group getting disconnected and dying though, not sure how justified that fear is.]
;B[ih]C[Didn't expect this move at all. Here I get short on time (the 20 minutes are gone, I spend 2 of my 3*30 seconds byoyomi reading this position...]

C[I think this is reasonable for white? Not sure if black should consider coming in at say K4 to reduce. I assume my opponent would have done that. Not sure how to react.

T: This seems OK. Black won't reduce right now but later yes. Approaching D16 looks bigger to me (Black F17 I think).]
;B[jp]C[Also I'm not sure what the followup against the left corner is if black ignores E7

T: The shape is strange. Here I would either tenuki (none of your groups is in danger and Black won't make any points here) or fight with K6 or K7 ? You should benefit from the attack.]
