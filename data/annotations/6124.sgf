AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[I'd like to know where I lost this game and where I did some mistakes. I have commented the moves of which I think were crucial.

I'd love to hear about ways to improve my game.

Thanks a lot!

sm - Hello, I will be reviewing the game for you. I am a KGS 6k, so don't take my advice as expert advice by any means. I hope I can provide some helpful comments and suggestions. All of my comments here out will be prefaced with sm.]
;W[pg];B[nc];W[pm]
(;B[mp]LB[mq:B][nq:A]C[Should this have been at A or B instead?

sm - see variation];W[cc]C[This is the first corner invasion, there are some more to follow. I really don't know yet how to react ...

sm - in my mind this is where white made his first mistake. True, he takes the corner, but the influence you build up on the side is more than enough compensation for the small amount of territory he will get. As a general rule, do not fear this invasion.]
;B[cd]LB[nc:A]C[... so I decided to choose one side, here the one which was "lighter", since I had played "A" on the other side

sm - as a general rule, you play on the side which is worth the most, not necessarily the lighter side. This move happens to conform with that guidance rather nicely.]
;W[dc]
(;B[df]LB[ec:A][ef:B][eg:C]C[Was this too "tight"? Hane at A or spring out to B or C?

- the move at A is usually standard, as it gives you good influence, as well as forcing him to live small. This move gives up too much for too little. (see variation for how playing at A would look)]
;W[ed];B[ee];W[fd]
(;B[di]LB[jc:A]C[Here I thought getting more influence, maybe turn it into territory  later.

sm - this move really doesn't do much except secure a couple of points, and a move around a is more urgent. (see variation.]
;W[fe];B[ff];W[jc];B[kd]LB[hp:A][pj:B]C[better to tenuki here; there are larger areas of the board to play on. You can either reenforce the bottom side with a move around A, or split his 2 white stones with B. I personally would prefer B here.]
;W[jd];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb];W[jb];B[kf]C[I tried to get out of the corner, but I don't think it was the appropriate move. What should have been the next move?

sm - splitting the 2 white stones on the side is still a viable option.]
;W[mb]TR[kf]LB[la:A]C[White will make this move later again!!!

Instead of playing the marked stone, I should habe defended once more, right? But where? At A?

I need to remember this shape ...

sm - under the circumstances, A does not work here (see variation to see why). The defense you put up is the best I can think of.]

(;B[mc];W[la];B[nb];W[ma];B[lc];W[cq]C[Another corner invasion ...]
;B[dq]C[... again, deciding to take the "lighter" side.

sm - in this case I'd block the other way. You have a huge investment in the stones in the upper left, and blocking the other way is more consistent with what you have on the board.]
;W[cp];B[co]C[This time I tried the hane.];W[bo];B[cn];W[bn]
;B[bm]LB[cm:B][eo:A]C[This second hane seems to be a problem. Should I have played A or B?

B seems to help White get more territory, so I was reluctant to play it.

What would be the right move here?

sm - B is the move to play here. If white wants the extra point or 2, let him have it; there are much bigger points on the board at this point.]
;W[cm];B[cl];W[dm];B[dl]LB[do:A]C[I should have connected at A, right?

sm; it's a tough call here, because connecting at A would save 2 stones, but this move helps strengthen the territory on the left side. at this point, the 2 stones are rather useless, so I'd probably give them up.]
;W[do];B[eo]LB[em:A][gp:B][gq:C]C[I didn't want to play A, as I felt the lower side was too weak.

sm - good call, but this move would probably have been better at B or C]
;W[dn];B[fq];W[fm];B[fl]C[sm -right idea here; contact moves are defensive moves.]
;W[gm];B[gl];W[hm]
(;B[kq]LB[iq:A]C[Another try to make territory. Not a good one I believe.

not necessarily a bad move, though I'd probably play it somewhere around A (see variation.]
;W[hl]C[White immediately answers.

sm - this move by white doesn't do all that much. it shuts you in, true, but he should be more worried about his stones on the right. on the flip side of that, you should take this opportunity to attack those stones.]
;B[hk];W[gk]
(;B[fk]C[I didn't know what to do ...

sm - as a general rule, he has entered an area in which you are strong, so you can reply more aggressively (see variation for an idea).]
;W[gj];B[fj]C[... so I defended a little more.];W[hj]LB[qj:A]
C[I didn't think I had to reply to that. White would not be able to make a lot of territory in the middle, even though the influence was frightening.

Instead I thought about weakening White's right side, which would definately be a problem for White.

I could have started at A, but then I thought about making a move which would allow me to control the outer influence and possibly "invade" at A later.]
;B[nm]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[This was my move, as it would probably still allow me to connect it to my lower group.

sm - this move should probably have been at A or B.];W[ik]LB[pj:A]
C[White takes my stone ...

sm - a mistake on white's part. Should have played at A];B[qj]
C[... and I enter White's sphere of influence.];W[qq]C[Again ... ANOTHER corner invasion at the 3,3 point. *sigh*]
;B[qp]TR[pm]C[I thought a connection to the marked stone would be dangerous.]
;W[pq];B[rq]C[sm; wrong side, should hane at P3];W[rr];B[ro]
LB[rp:A]C[Should this have been at A?];W[sq];B[pl]LB[oj:A]C[I wasn't sure about the way the corner had proceeded, so I wanted to limit the stone's potential right here.

sm - as a general rule, don't make contact moves while attacking, as it tends to strengthen the weakened stone. Simply jumping at A seems best.]
;W[oq];B[op];W[nq];B[mq];W[np];B[no];W[mr];B[lr];W[ms];B[ls]
C[sm - this move is very small (1 point), and you should play elsewhere.]
;W[or];B[qg]LB[oj:A]C[Here I thought I'd be able to make some territory.

sm - jumping out to A would be far more effective.];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[oc]C[My shape seems "overstretched", and the reply ...]
;W[qd]C[... is the cut, and it really hurts.

sm - this cut is really no big deal (see variation)]
(;B[qc];W[pc];B[pb];W[pd];B[na];W[ka];B[rc]LB[rd:A]C[I didn't like this move.

But I don't know which would have been a better reply. Playing A instead could lead to a double atari.

sm - at this point this move is the best you can do.];W[rd]
;B[sc];W[rp];B[qn]TR[pm]LB[qo:A]C[This play seemed to balance between immobilizing the white stone and defending a cut at A.]
;W[po]C[Still, White comes after me.];B[pn]C[Better cut them ...]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[lo];B[ko];W[kp];B[jp];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[iq]
;W[lp];B[ln];W[jo];B[jq];W[kn];B[lm]TR[mp][mq]C[I sacrificed the marked two stones in order to gain more outer influence.]
;W[lq];B[kr];W[km];B[mk]C[sm - good move, as the white group in the upper right corner is still eyeless.]
;W[lf]
(;B[kg]LB[lg:A][nf:B]C[sm - too slack; you have the advantage here. I'd play either a hane at A or play extremely aggressively and split white's groups with B (see variation)]

I think I made some real bad mistakes throughout the game and would like to get some pointers on how to improve.

Thanks for reviewing!

sm - as with everyone who plays go, working on reading ability pays big dividends. It sounds cliche, but life and death problems are a great practice. Other than that, you could be a bit more aggressive in countering the other player's moves. At the very least, it is far more interesting than playing submissively. Also, during the course of the game, it is often far more important to weaken your opponent's groups and make territory during the attack, rather than make moves that focus solely on territory. Finally, learn to look critically at your opponent's moves and see what they are trying to accomplish. If you don't see what the point is, don't react to the possibility that there might be a threat. He might be very wrong. With all that said, good luck. If you have any questions, I can be reached at SM_MAN87@yahoo.com.]
