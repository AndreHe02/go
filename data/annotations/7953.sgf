C[Thanks for reviewing. I played black and lost because i failed to kill something that should have died.

[EV\] This was an interesting game to review.  W actually won by outplaying B slightly in several different places, which I will try to point out.  B really had no chance in the final fight.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[oc];W[dq];B[qo]C[I think this might have been a little bit naive. I expected him to go p4 or q3.

[EV\] This move is fine.  P4 next would be a normal good move for W.  Q3 is probably not good, as B could press nicely with P4 and W would end up too low.]
;W[oq];B[lq]C[[EV\] I would just take the corner with R3 and let W extend here.  Sure, that is what W wants, but R3 really is big.  Both sides seem intent on frustrating the other side's plans here.]
;W[qq];B[ql]C[Trying to seal in was impossible, it would only hurt my m3 stone.]
;W[iq];B[np]C[[EV\] This leads to a difficult fight, when W refuses to be sealed in.  The next W move is forced.  I have no idea what the result should be after this.]
;W[po]
(;B[pp];W[qp];B[op];W[qn];B[pq];W[pm]C[White should just capture.

[EV\] Yes, that would give W a good result.  But that just means B should extend previously, making W capture two stones.]
;B[ro];W[rn]
(;B[qr]C[[EV\] B missed a nice forcing move at P6 here.  W probably has to connect (see variation).]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[so]C[[EV\] Let's call this result even.];B[qi]
C[[EV\] This is a large point, as it is an ideal extension from the B shimari.  But the B stone at R8 is too close to W thickness to be worth much.  Approaching one of the open W corners would be equally good.]
;W[qe]C[[EV\] This strikes me as a bit of an overplay by W, but he ends up with a good result.  That seemed to be the theme of this game.  B should try hard to find a continuation which keeps the W stone weak and under attack, while making territory above.]
;B[pe];W[qf];B[rd];W[og]LB[oi:A]C[[EV\] Nice light play by W.  Now B needs to keep R11 from becoming weak.  The one space jump to "A" looks like the vital point for both sides.]
;B[qg]C[[EV\] Contact plays like this are usually not a good way to attack, as they provoke the opponent to strengthen his position.]
;W[pf];B[rg];W[oe];B[pd];W[pj]LB[oh:A]C[[EV\] Looks like another overplay?  B should cut and fight, starting with "A".  The stone at R8 is not important, compared to the center balance of power.  See variations for some possibilities.]
(;B[pi];W[oi];B[oj];W[ni];B[pk];W[nj];B[ok]MA[ql][qi][oc][qd]
C[[EV\] B made a small territory on the side, but W got nice thickness.  W actually did well here, considering that B started out with the X-marked stones, and W now has sente.]
;W[co];B[fc];W[df];B[jd];W[ld]C[[EV\] Another slight overplay by W?  But again he ends up with a good result.]
(;B[ne]C[Could black handle this differently?

[EV\] This is a good idea -- lean against the strong group to attack the weak stone, but unfortunately it was not enough of a threat to force W to answer.  See variation for a more forceful splitting attack.]
;W[lf]C[[EV\] Nice dodge by W.];B[nf];W[mg];B[ng];W[nh]LB[hc:A]
C[[EV\] This result is unsatisfactory for B -- he has nothing left to attack and there is a glaring weakness at "A" which really requires immediiate protection.]
;B[dr];W[er]
(;B[eq]C[Maybe c3 instead of e3?

[EV\] Yes, that looks better.  B probably has a ko in the corner.  He could switch to the upper left now, leaving this corner for later.]
;W[fq];B[ep];W[cr];B[fp]C[[EV\] The ladder does not work, so B has nothing good here.  This move is an admission of failure.  Maybe try H3 instead?  Or tenuki and see how things develop later.]
;W[fr];B[dn];W[do]C[The 3 stones are not important right now. The left side is more interesting.]
;B[cn];W[eo]C[[EV\] This result is terrible for B -- two separated weak groups pressed tightly against strong W stones.]
;B[bo];W[bp];B[cj];W[hc]C[[EV\] Very severe invasion.];B[hd]
;W[ic];B[jc]LB[id:A][gd:B]C[[EV\] Overplay -- B is much too thin here for this to give a good result.  B may be behind, but patience is still called for. Either "A" or "B" is necessary.]
;W[id];B[ie];W[gd];B[he];W[gc];B[lb]C[Horrible play, i do not know why i played here... the cut is so extremely severe.]
;W[je]C[[EV\] B has no chance after this.  Last comment except for a few notes on the final fight.]

(;W[if]C[[EV\] W could wrap up the game safely by giving up these two stones.]
;B[hf];W[ig];B[jh];W[hg];B[lh]C[I believe this kills the group, however there is so much aji in blacks shape that one might think its not.
And if white lives, can black still make a comeback somehow?

[EV\] If B can kill W here, it is only because W got greedy or did not see the danger.]
;W[lg];B[mh]LB[mc:A]C[[EV\] Maybe "A" instead?];W[mf];B[nc]
;W[of];B[ph];W[kh];B[ki];W[ji]C[The most important cut, however with the influence on the left side it would still be possible to do something for black.]

(;B[me]C[[EV\] Attack the weak stone directly?  The variations look good for B.]
