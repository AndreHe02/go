RE[W+1.5]

C[I'm playing black in this game. I'll appreciate any comments you have on either black or white.

MM:  Hi, I'm Mike Malveaux, 4k in the AGA.  I'll do my best to provide a good review of your game.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[oc];W[ci];B[qj]TR[pj]C[MM:  So far, so good.  White is using the "low Chinese" pattern.  Black's move commonly is one line higher, at Q10 {triangle}, but I think this is also is okay.]
;W[nq]TR[cn]SQ[jp]C[MM:  I cannot say this move is "bad", but it seems odd to me.  Usually with the "Chinese" openings, the player's hope is to invite the opponent inside the framework where there is not really enough room to play efficiently.  White would want Black to play somewhere around C6 {tri.}.  So, I think White would do better with something like K4 {sq.}.]
;B[lq]C[MM:  I think this is good.];W[pr]TR[qq]C[MM:  This is usually at R3.]
;B[qq];W[no];B[pn]TR[iq]C[MM:  This is probably good, but I would want to play at J3 {tri.}.]
;W[jq]
(;B[nm]C[MM:  I question this move.  Giving up the M3 stone this way seems like it gives White too much.  I do not like jumping to the center with N5 though, because it lets White have the dual-purpose move at K5 {see var.}.  Rather, I would want to play something like H3 {see var.}.  But I often lose by picking fights when I don't need to, so maybe I have the wrong idea here.]
;W[lp]TR[mo]C[MM:  It's often better to attack from a distance.  I think N5 might be better.]
;B[jd]C[MM:  I like this!];W[ln]C[MM:  Too local, and too close to existing strong stones.]
;B[oe]TR[jd][gc]C[MM:  This also is too local, and too close to existing strong stones.  A better follow-up to the excellence of K16 would be something near G17.]
;W[ok]TR[jd][nm][mk][kf][lh][mj][li][kg]SQ[oe][oh][og][nj][nk]
C[MM:  Interesting.  If you like Bruce Wilcox's thinking about "sector lines", this looks like it's dangerously deep inside the imaginarly lines between K16 - O7, and P15 - O7.  It should be easy for Black to attack this stone profitably.  The danger will be if White simply threatens to rescue it from the outside, and thereby builds enough strength to secure the southwest.]
(;B[pl]C[MM:  Wrong direction -- N8 would be better {var.}.]
;W[pi];B[pj]TR[mk]C[MM:  Tactically, it's often better to attack from a distance.  These two Whites are deep within Black's sphere of influence.  In the center of the board, it takes at least 10 stones to form the smallest living group.  Black's plan should be:  A. Cut the stones off, isolate them from help;  B. Keep the group as small as possible;  C. Play on the vital point before White does.  I would rather see this move at N9 to isolate the White stones.]
;W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[nh];B[og]C[MM:  That worked out well for Black.  The northeast corner, and in fact the whole east side, is very strong for Black.  Meanwhile White still has many weak points that Black can attack.]
;W[ml];B[mm]TR[gc][de][cn]C[MM:  Too local.  I like the points marked near G17, D15, or C6 better.]
;W[lm]TR[ll]C[MM:  This leaves a serious cutting point at M8.]
;B[do]TR[mm][ll]SQ[cn][ck]C[MM:  This is interesting, and I think inconsistent with the previous move at O7.  Why not take advantage of the cutting point at N8?  Also, making this kind of contact move is sometimes correct -- usually when you are attacking inside a position that is already strong.  {The reason is that contact plays like D5 tend to make both sides stronger.  If the opponent is already strong in a local area, it does no good to become even stronger -- that is inefficient.}  However when the position is as open as it is here in the southwest, it's usually better to attack from a slight distance. like C6 or C9.]
;W[ep];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp];W[bq];B[eo]TR[cn]C[MM:  Too greedy.  Try to live first, before trying to live large.  Any Black living group here in White's sphere is great for Black, so try to make living shape with something like C6.  {Just imagine how Black would feel if White's next move were C6!}]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[cn]C[MM:  Good!];W[cl];B[gn];W[hn];B[gq]
C[MM:  I think this is too soon.];W[hp];B[kq];W[kp];B[jr];W[iq]
;B[ir];W[fr];B[gr];W[mr];B[lr];W[ls];B[hq];W[mq]C[Here,  I realize black is dead if white K1, but white didn't kill.]
;B[fq];W[er];B[hs]C[MM:  I said, "Nice!  Two living groups inside White's sphere."  I now realize that White at K1 will still kill.]
(;W[hm];B[cm];W[dl];B[bl];W[bk];B[am]
(;W[jh]TR[ll]C[MM:  Nice move for White.  Too bad Black didn't hit the N8 cutting point before White made this move.  Also, White at K1 is still a killing move -- which I did not realize the first few times I looked at this game, sorry!]
;B[kr]C[MM:  I said, "Saving these three stones -- six measly points in gote -- is a horrible mistake at this point of the game."  I was wrong, because this move saves the whole group.]
;W[hd]C[MM:  White got the big point.  This may be the move that won.]
;B[jf];W[hg];B[em];W[fl];B[el];W[ek];B[dk]C[MM:  Nice tactical sacrifice!]

;B[hk];W[ik];B[hj];W[ij];B[fj]TR[ic]SQ[fp]C[MM:  This is relatively small.  Bigger points are J17 or the cut at F4.]
;W[fi]TR[ei]SQ[ic]C[MM:  A White mistake to leave the E11 cutting point.  It would be better to play at E11, or take the big J17 point.]

;W[cf]C[MM:  Good White defense, attacking from a slight distance and denying Black any room to make a base!]

;B[di];W[cj]TR[dh]
(;B[ng]TR[qr]C[MM:  Good to break off from the dead group in the west.  I still think the R2 point is bigger.  The F3-G4 cut is big too.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[hi];B[gj];W[lh];B[nj]TR[mg]SQ[qr]C[MM:  I don't think this attack gets any profit.  Better just to play N13.  R2 {sq.} is much bigger endgame though -- probably enough to win.]
;W[mj];B[mh];W[mi];B[mg];W[lg];B[lf]C[MM:  This sequence ends in gote for Black...]

C[MM:  White wins by 1.5.  Black caught up somewhat by keeping sente in the endgame, but not quite enough.  I like how Black is not afraid to sacrifice stones, and not afraid to attack inside the opponent's sphere.  I would like to see Black attack from a distance more, rather than with contact plays.  Ko did not arise in this game, despite some chances for ko in the southwest.  This makes me suspect neither player is comfortable with ko.  So I would like to see Black actively looking for chances to fight ko in the next several games.  A good habit to develop is counting the score every 15 or 20 moves.  This will reveal the areas most in need of attention, because you won't be certain of the score in those areas.  And of course, doing more go problems to increase tactical reading and strength is always a good idea.  I hope my comments have been accurate and useful, and I wish you much enjoyment playing many more years of go!
