[krinid\] Hello!  I have reviewed this game for you.  You made a numbers of mistakes that I've pointed out.  For the most part, your mistakes are just simply playing non-urgent, non-big moves.  There are a few opportunities you could have tenuki'd and played bigger moves.  Also, you played tengen but didn't really use it effectively.  If you play tengen, it means you're letting white take the initiative in the corner attacks, so you need to drive it back to the center to help your fights.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj]C[I'm currently experimenting with the tengen, because i like the idea of having a point to be able to run to. In that regard I think it worked quite well

[krinid\] If you're playing tengen, you should play aggressive cuts and variations where a winning ladder is required.  If you're only using it as somewhere to run to, you're not getting the full value of it.]
;W[nq];B[qn];W[qf]
(;B[nc];W[pi]
(;B[qk]C[Too slow?

[krinid\] Yes, a bit.  This move is not bad, but you already have a kakari in the corner and there are bigger moves left on the board still.  See variation for some other plays.]
;W[qj];B[pk];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[kc];W[qb];B[pb];W[qd];B[pc]

(;W[rb]C[[krinid\] White should tenuki here instead.  This move is too small.  2nd line plays this early in the game are too small.  See variation.]

(;B[cf];W[ce]
(;B[ci]C[[krinid\] This is a bad move.  It let's white push you a bit in sente while securing the corner and then make territory elsewhere.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dg];B[dh]
(;W[jp]C[[krinid\] White's top left corner is secure, black doesn't have much territory on the left, and white is making a moyo on the bottom side.  HOWEVER ... instead of k4, c8 probably would have had more effect.  See variation.]

(;B[cl]C[[krinid\] Now black is safe and unpressured on the side.  A wasted opportunity for white.  You might want to even play c7 or c6 here instead.  Remember, you have played tengen, so you should play aggressively and try to drive invading white stones toward it.  See variation.]
;W[cn]
(;B[eh]C[[krinid\] Terrible!  If you're going to play this, at least make it a jump @ F12, but with g17, f3, c3, q2 still open, there's no reason to play such a small move.  Were you worried about your group's shape or its ability make eyes?  See variation.]
;W[gc]C[I think move 33 lost me the game, 'cause 34 (or rather H17) could have easily become those 17 points I missed in the end.

[krinid\] Agreed, but don't play H17 - play g17!  You have stones at L17 and O17 and K10 and E12 - surrounded everywhere but in the corner at d16, and if white forces you into the corner, it will only reduce white's own corner territory and pressure c15.]

;B[nm]C[[krinid\] Why o7?  What are you attempting with this move?  Right corner, left corner, g3 bottom side are much bigger.  Or J16 to begin to make center territory.]
;W[no]C[[krinid\] Ouch.];B[lm]C[[krinid\] You don't need to play this.  You can connect to Q9 or R6 or Q4 or K10 ... no need to defend against this.  Play in the corners or on the bottom.]
;W[mn]C[[krinid\] Ouch ... white is making territory here at your expense.  But you still don't need to defend this.  If white cuts between, play Q7 to keep it alive if you need to.  Or just throw that stone away and make territory elsewhere.]
;B[mm];W[jm]C[[krinid\] Ouch ouch ouch.  Now you really need to jump into that corner with a 3-3 or kakari to at least make some territory there.]
;B[lk];W[li];B[lg]C[[krinid\] Yes, finally making territory in the center.  (;]
