C[Hi!

This was a short game full of confusing fighting. It's always difficult to comment on a game like that, but I hope I managed to say something useful nonetheless :)]
;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[hq]C[I did not expect this move, I hoped c6 is more natural.
-----------
h3 looks fine, no?]
(;B[fo]C[I guess I did not choose the correct joseki in this situation. Why?
-----------------
Your move isn't that bad, but please look at the variations for some professional ideas in this position.]
;W[dn];B[dr]LB[dl:C][fm:B][ip:A][kp:D]C[But this is a serious mistake because Black loses the possibility of invading the corner at 3-3. Simply following the joseki with A or exchanging BB, WC, then attacking with BD would have been much better.]
;W[cq];B[kq]LB[kp:A]C[I thought this would be enough for pressing white h3 while building territory in the right side. Is this wrong timing? 
-------
If you want to attack an enemy stone, to play on the fourth line (A) is superior in most cases.]
;W[cr]LB[ho:A]C[Very slow, White should play at A.]
(;B[dq]LB[ip:A]C[Your game will improve a lot if you stop playing automatically at the same place your opponent did. Please look at the variation for A!]
;W[ep];B[fp];W[eq]C[Quite useless!];B[er]LB[ip:A]C[What do you need these two stones for? White is alive without capturing, so playing there is pure endgame. BA is much, much better.]
;W[gr];B[fr];W[ho];B[fm]C[Is this move correct? I guess I gave white a chance to protect its shape in the right corner.
---------------
Bf7 looks like the only move.];W[en];B[fn];W[el]
(;B[cl]C[I got a little desperate for w's framework in the left corner here, and forgot about the fight on the right side.
----------
Yes, your play is not consistant here. The left side is small. Please look at the variation!]
;W[ck]C[I think this move not very good for white. But did not know how to take advantage of it.
-----------
I don't think there is a way to do so.];B[em];W[dm];B[dl];W[dk]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[bo];B[cm];W[bq];B[ek];W[fl];B[gl]LB[ej:A]
C["If you can't capture, don't atari." A strong player said this to me in  a game review some years ago... Simply playing BA looks much better.]
;W[fk];B[ej];W[fj];B[bk]LB[ei:A]C[I prefer BA.];W[ei]
(;B[dj]C[this move was miscalculated for black. I guess I should have given up the two stones, but I am afraid the position was too low for b anyhow.
---------
You can't give up those stones.];W[cj];B[di];W[bj]LB[dh:A]C[Now, BA! When you have to fight, one important idea is to give your own stones as much liberties as you can.]
;B[bi];W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[cg];W[dg];B[eh];W[bg]LB[cf:A][bh:B]
[gi:C]C[How about BA, WB, BC?!]
(;B[fi]C[Very bad, inviting White to split Black up.];W[hk]
;B[cf];W[bh]LB[hj:C][il:A][hm:B]C[You could have tried A or B here (the idea is C next), but the position is out of Black's control, I fear.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi];B[ij];W[gm];B[hl];W[hm]
;B[il];W[hh];B[gg];W[jh];B[hp]C[Good move!];W[ip];B[gp];W[in]
LB[io:A]C[The solid connection at A looks better.];B[iq];W[jq]
;B[is]LB[ir:A]C[A misclick? After BA, the game is long from being decided...]
;W[ir]C[Well :)

To sum it up, I think if you do believe in shape even during the worst fighting, you will win a lot more fights than you do now :)]

;B[ci]LB[dj:A][pj:B]C[If White goes after the f3 stone, Black can try to neutralize any white strength by making a base on the left side (A instead of c11 also looks fine). Basically, B is the most important point now.]
