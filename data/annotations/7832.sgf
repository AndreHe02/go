AB[pd][dp]C[asama500 [3k\]: hi
dancor [5k\]: hi

hello reviewer, i felt like i did a good job of seizing sente in this handicap game, but i wasn't sure if i had good direction and was getting large moves.  i have a huge tactical failure in the upper left corner at one point.  to progress, do i simply need to get better at reading for such battles or do i also need to learn to risk less in such situations?  i also have some specific questions in comments, and a couple points where i ask for advice about a particular area.  anything else you see along the way is great too.  thanks, --dancor

;W[hk];B[ik];W[hi]C[> Main topic of this game: Black lost a won game by putting up unecessary and risky resistance against W's corner attack. Before that it was possible to wrap up the game cleanly by taking gote to secure that corner.

> The key to handling such situations is to judge the position, even roughly, between each fight. When ahead, as you were in the late middlegame, you know can afford to spend a gote to lock your lead. Without a judgement, you'll be tempted to take bad risks to maximize your gain, which can easily backfire.

> Middlegame tips:
> When defending, pick the direction that will enable counterattacks; don't be content with passive moves (e.g. J12 versus O7).
> When attacking, play for a definite gain (don't just "try to kill") and know when to stop, so you can resume the attack when time is ripe. Try to have attacks that involve multiple opponent weaknesses instead of hammering one group until it is fully settled.

> Shape tips: 
> Avoid giving strong shape unless you have clear reasons... (R9, R15, C15)
> When the opponent is strong nearby your position, consider possible severe attacks (e.g. White could have gone 3-3 earlier in the game) and defend accordingly.

> Opening tips: 
> Remember 4th line is for development, 3rd for completion (stability), and take opponent stones into account to make your choice (e.g. Q10 versus R10).
> Don't commit too early in a miai situation (N17 vs. D10) as it makes choices easier for your opponent.
> Also, checking extensions are really big moves (e.g. F17) that enable further attacks, so don't forget to play them.]
