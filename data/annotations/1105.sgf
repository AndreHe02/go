A?

;B[qj]LB[fc:A]C[Again, maybe it's just me but this 2 space extension feels a
little funny.  To me, it doesn't look like it works most efficiently
with your stones at the bottom.

You could treat Black 9 as a forcing move and play somewhere
else (to test W's response) such as A.];W[nq]

See var.];W[np];B[pn];W[kq];B[jr]LB[jq:b][iq:a]C[D:  What do you think of this knights move attack rather than
"a" or "b"?

"a" looks a little heavy and not very dynamic

"b" strengthens your opponent but at the same time makes him
concentrated.  But then again, one can argue it's ok since his
group is in the middle of your territory.

I think B 17 is the best move of the 3.];W[kr]

better)];B[db]C[This is a bad move.  After W plays W 28, this stone can be captured

If you're going to play in this area, simply jumping to A looks
better.

(;B[mk]LB[qi:A][pj:B]C[Playing at A would be normal, B would be super thick (both are
sente).  B 41 seems a little thin to be a good attacking move.

See var.

D:  Very interesting.  Several of your variations favor pushing
the white group to the right rather than to the left.  My overall
idea was to push the group left hoping to eventually weaken the
left side groups.    N: The reason I favor pushing to the right is because it is a
common strategy to push your opponent into one's thickness.]

to move the fight over to the left side of the board.

Hmm, moving the fight to the left is hard because your marked
stones are in the way.];W[lh];B[mg];W[ki]

(;B[lg]LB[ig:A]TR[dm][dj]SQ[cp][ep][im][il][jk][jj][ih]C[Wrong direction, better to play at A and make thickness towards
the left (again)

D:  Ok, here is a question:  What good is thickness on the left
if it faces live white groups on the edge?  This is the basic
question that I asked in the initial review -- did I miss out
on some opportunity to use this attack for profit?  This move
(65) is where my strategy really started to fall flat it seemed.
"a" is very interesting.  Maybe I should have simply abandoned
the chase at this point and gone elsewhere?

N: To me, thickness that is hovering over your opponent's territory
is like a dark storm approaching.

The thicker your marked stones are, the weaker W's marked stones
get (and his potential for territory becomes less and less)

See var.];W[ii]C[Nice move];B[ij]LB[hj:A]C[Hmm, bad shape, how about A?

liked better.  Perhaps "a" would have been a better choice.]

out what would happen if white decended to "a".  It looked too
big to not handle.

you had time to figure out the score, you could of then played
safe and secure (while taking as many big endgame points of course!)]

Because the game was close (for an amateur game), I'd say you
made a series of small mistakes which cost you a game I felt
you were winning at one point (although, your opponent also made
some mistakes in the endgame that let you catch up momentarily)

Your 2 space extension of moves 9 and 11 did not (nor could not)
help in attacking the W's group so I can't recommend it (unless
