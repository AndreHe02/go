C[
 nataraj 27k : I play black. This is the second time on the large 19x19 board - up to now I only played on 13x13. Most of the time during the game I had a very good feeling that I was keeping my groups together and making territory. I have a suspicion where I actually lost the game but probably I missed many other opportunities and dangers. I would be glad if you would comment the game. thank you.

Your strategy of pushing into the opponent from your strong group at the bottom is likely to be more effective on a smaller board like 13x13. Although your groups are stronger if they are connected and a group that is already alive cannot be killed in an attack, you often need to start a second front by playing in a new area before your opponent is too strong. In the end, however, this is not what costs you the game. It becomes a contest of who makes the last major territory losing mistake. White makes disasterous mistakes at the top that lets you destroy a lot of his territory. You then do the same at the bottom, giving the game back to him. The lesson is to be alert for weak groups that can be cut off and have few liberties. Certain patterns of weakness come up repeatedly and you will remember them after they happen often enough in your games.

Many of your own comments are insightful. I hope I added something to your understanding of the game. I suggest you continue to play on the 19x19 to explore the wider scope of strategy it offers.]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[pp];W[pd];B[jp]C[up to now it sort of follows "the book"]
;W[hq];B[hp]LB[jq:A][iq:B]C[A move like A or B is more usual in this situation, building influence to the right and confining w to a narrow base.]
;W[fq];B[eq]C[I trry to keep the center and not let him into the corner

This is good.];W[jq];B[gq]LB[kq:a]C[I guess this is not quite the right spot for attack. In retrospect a(L3) looks better, maybe even  farther away

L3 seems good but your move is not horrible];W[gr];B[gp];W[kq]
;B[mq]LB[nq:A]C[this "feels" right, but I'm not sure why.

It harasses w's weak group while building territorial framework to the right. A combined attack and territory making move is always good.
You could consider A for a little less attack and a little more security.]
;W[lr];B[mr];W[qn];B[fr]C[I thought I could ignore the attck on R6 and do a little fighting myself.]
;W[hr];B[fp]C[
I wonder if you need to play this capture now. w's stone was clearly dead, but had some potential for creating complications. It is a subtle question. I probably would have left this move for later.]
;W[qq]C[I think I can separate the two white stones

Seems reasonable.];B[qp];W[rp];B[ro]LB[qo:A]C[I thought there was not enough space for white to live in the corner. I expected white to play A (R5)]
;W[rq];B[pq]C[should probably have been R5, but I did not see it

Yes, this a common sequence of moves, so it will be good to remember it in the future.]
;W[qo]LB[lo:A][mn:B]C[Now there is no way to save the stone at S5, but I try anyway. should I have played R2 immediately?

R2 will widen your eye space some, but it is in gote. The other thought is to play a move like A which moves into the center with a group that probably has one eye for a base and at the same time threaten to block w's bot. group from getting to the center.]
;B[rn]C[
As you say this is not going to work. The only reason to play it is to use it as a sacrifice.]
;W[rm];B[qr];W[rr];B[qs];W[rs];B[or];W[lo];B[kp]C[tried to separate them]
;W[cj];B[dm]LB[cm:A][cn:B][fc:C][nc:D][qf:E][cf:F]C[too high? Now it seems like A or B would have been better

Yes, I think so. An approach move against one of w's corners also be good now. Notice that while your postions are secure, you have no position at the top and that ultimately w tries to claim the entire top.]
;W[cm];B[cn]TR[fm][hn]C[I felt there was a good big eye shape (marks)  forming on lower left center

You have no concerns about life for the group and to have b stones at the triangles would be very overconcentrated, The game move is OK but you need to move to the top soon.]
;W[cl]LB[bm:a]C[so I was glad to follow him up the side. would it have been better to go under (like a) ?

Not really.];B[dl]C[
This is OK.];W[dk];B[fl]C[
This move is overconcentration. It is the type of move you would make if you concerned about the life of your group or there are no big points left on the board. You need to play elsewhere.]
;W[bn];B[co];W[fk];B[bo]LB[bp:A]C[Felt like I needed to secure the corner

I can understand the feeling and as long w responds it is OK, but you could have let him play here and answer at A and in the meantime play elsewhere.]
;W[bm];B[gk];W[fj];B[hk]LB[gj:a]C[I was not sure whether I should follow (a at G10), but thought to better keep the area below

To repeat: You are single-mindedly playing on the same side of the board and it is making w build a large area of influence, which gets more and more difficult to enter. Which moves are good and which moves are not so good here is one issue, but the strategic issue is that you need a position at the top as well.]
;W[pj];B[nl]TR[mn][pn][mo][mp][po][mm][pm][ol]SQ[ik][jk][kk]
[ll][lm][ln]LB[fc:A][nc:B][qf:C][jc:D][jd:E]C[now I could not decide: attck the white right side or build eye-shape below (triangles) or continue building the area on the left toward the center. I am not happy with this move but still I do not know better.

Play at the top. A-E. Both of your groups at the bot are secure with 2 eyes and at least one should be able to come out into the center later.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[lj];B[lk]C[At this moment I thought that the whole upper half was white and I needed to invade, but from a strong base

You realize the size of w's influence now but it is getting late to do something as w gets stronger and stronger.]
;W[kj]C[
Notice how your contact play made w strengthen a wall that he trying to develope?]
;B[kk];W[jj];B[nj]C[tried to expand into white's land

This is good. w has a real gap here.];W[ni]C[no success]
(;B[mj];W[mi]C[
This was a predictable response and w's wall gets stronger. You might have been better off to play here yourself. w will cut and then you lay some ground work for a position on his side. See alternate line.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[pk];W[qj];B[qk]LB[pl:a][ol:b]TR[rn][ro]C[now I think this was wrong an that I should have played at a (Q8) or b (P8) . I was still hoping to somehow save the two black stones at S5,6

Those stones have very little potential, but a or b are no good. Play at the top.]
;W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm]LB[pn:a]C[now this looked good. with a cut at a(Q6) ...

It is not. See next comment.];W[so]LB[ok:A]SQ[qm]C[he saw it,of course

Actually he might as well play at A now and capture your stones.
It is easy to miss these situations. You have to heighten your awareness of your cutting points and the number of liberties of your stones. Your stones were not  in serious danger until you played  the marked stone which took away one too many of your liberties.]
;B[pn];W[sn];B[po]C[but at least I had a nice big area (almost the whole lower half. I did not think there was any danger any more]
;W[ok]TR[pk][qk][ql][qm]LB[nk:a][om:b]C[So this came as a complete surprise. I knew the marked stones were dead. what now? close at a and b?

Play at the top. Save a or b for later.];B[qc]LB[nc:A][fc:B]
[jc:C]C[I'm going for the corners instead

Best move you played in a while. A-C also deserve consideration.]
;W[qd];B[pc];W[oc];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[rd];W[re];B[sd]
LB[rc:A]C[
Usually played at A for reasons that become apparant.];W[se]
;B[cc]C[should have secured the right corner first, but thought I was  ok]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb];W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[ad]
;W[ae];B[bb]C[now this time I thought about it. of course this gave him the idea  ...

Yes.];W[rc];B[rb];W[sc];B[qa]LB[sb:a]C[I think a at T18 would have been much better?

Yes.];W[pb];B[qb];W[pa];B[oa]LB[sb:A]C[
A better, gives you 2 eyes. You can capture the 2 stones anytime.]
;W[sb];B[mb]C[trying to get the second eye];W[lb];B[ma]C[two eyes at last!]
;W[la];B[od]C[I tried to "cut"];W[oe]LB[lc:A][hi:B]C[but got caught in a ladder

Sure, but now cut again at A and see if something develops. You need to create complications if you hope to enter w's area. B is also an opening.  See alternates]

(;B[nd];W[md];B[kg]C[this was intended as a ladder breaker]
;W[me]LB[hi:A]C[didn't work

No, but you just want a chance to play in w's area in sente.  Maybe this will somehow work with your move at A]
;B[ij]LB[hi:A]C[I go back to the plan of invading from my "home base"

Notice how this move helps w build his wall in a way that A would not.]
;W[ii];B[hj];W[hi];B[kh]TR[kg]LB[ji:a][li:b]C[I thought I could re-use the marked stone to attck at a

Nice thought, but w can connect at either a or b so he is safe. You need to try to make a wide loose structure of stones and hope to get 2 eyes. You can try to use w's cutting points to let you do this in sente which is your only hope, but keep in mind the goal of eye shape.]
;W[ig]C[
Good move by w. Blocks you off from one direction.];B[ji];W[li]
;B[jk];W[el];B[em];W[ek];B[gl];W[ol];B[om]C[I thought to contain the damage

OK, but note that this move is not really forcing. If you take, w has a snap back.]
;W[pl];B[nk]C[Try to kill w's bot instead. This move is only worth 1 point.in gote.]
;W[nm];B[mm]LB[mn:a]C[better at a (N6) ??

No, I don't think so];W[nn];B[mn];W[no];B[mo]TR[no][lo]C[I was sure to have enough liberties and glad to keep the two white stones separated

So far so good. But keep them both separated from the bot is more important in case w's bot gets life.]
;W[cf]C[when he gave up the fight in the lower right corner, I went back to my invasion plans]
;B[gi];W[gj];B[if]LB[gh:a]C[Now I am sure I would have lost if he had cought me at a

Your chances are still not good with perfect play, but it is worth a try.]
;W[jf];B[jg]LB[hg:A]C[
w needs to play at A. See alternate.]
(;W[ki]C[
w plays on wrong side. He needs to watch his weaknesses above all else.]
;B[ih]C[double atari

Good job!]
(;W[hg]LB[jh:a][hh:b]TR[ji]C[I think he did not see the second atari. otherwise he would have killed my stone playing at a

b also would have been better.];B[hh]C[this I thought should win the game for me

Looks pretty good.];W[eh]LB[mg:A]C[at this point I tried to move straight up to connect either to the left or right corner

This would just be connecting fro the sake of connecting. What you want to do is try to kill the bot group or extend to damage w's area as much as possible. A would be good for the latter.]
;B[hf];W[gg];B[gh];W[fg];B[jd]
(;W[kf]LB[ke:A]C[
Mistake, Should be A.];B[lf];W[le];B[ke];W[kd];B[je];W[gf];B[hd]
;W[gd];B[hc];W[mf];B[gb]C[connect successful

Connect not too important, but you did more damage to w so it is good.]
;W[lg];B[kf];W[lh];B[he]C[
These are small plays compared to the bottom.];W[ge];B[kc];W[lc]
;B[ld]LB[kb:a]C[I think this was a big mistake: it allows white to invade. probably a would have been better?

Yes, but bottom is what is really important now.];W[jb]C[How can I stop the white invasion once it is started?

You can't. Don't worry about it.];B[kb];W[ka];B[jc];W[ib];B[hb]
;W[ha];B[ga];W[ia];B[ic];W[ja];B[kd];W[ml]C[I did not think this was dangerous at all.]
;B[mk];W[ll];B[km];W[np];B[mp]C[I was sure the wall and the right group could connect and make life

No problem at this point.];W[nq];B[nr];W[lp];B[lq]C[cut. plus: I sort of hoped to be able to shrink the white space on the bottom and kill it

Might work!];W[ip];B[io];W[iq]
(;B[kr]LB[jo:a]TR[ip][lo]SQ[jp][kp]C[that's why I attcked here, not seeing the danger at a.

I believe here is where I lost the game. A rough count gives me a lead of about 10 points even if the bottom side is white. But I did not count.

Yes. This is another pattern that is worth remembering because it comes up all the time. The key points are the 2 marked b stones with only 2 liberties and the 2 marked w stones.]

(;W[jo]LB[jr:A]C[a sad blow!

Actually, best play for w is A first. See alternate.]
(;B[kl]LB[jn:a][jr:b]C[can't remember why I did this. would the forcing move at a (K6) have been better?

Yes, contain the damage.
But really interesting is b. You might be able to hold him to one eye at your dead stones and kill him yet. See alternate.]
