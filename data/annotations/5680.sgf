(;W[qq]C[I hesitate quite long to come here. I was thinking about extending at the bottom, maybe around K4.

[Hello, I'm the reviewer for this game. After R3 White gets the corner territory, while Black gets a strong wall, which cooperates nicely with the Q7 stone and nullifies the influence of both White Q7 and O4. See variation.\]]

(;B[pq]C[[The other direction seems more correct. Var.\]];W[qp]
;B[qo];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn]C[I'm not sure I need this move. Maybe better take the initiative and play elsewhere.

[No, this is an important move - double sente. Black can't let you play R7, so he has to play there himself, while if had you tenukied, Black S6 is sente against your corner. Can't omit this move.\]]
;B[qm];W[ph]C[Maybe it's more urgent to help the O4 stone.

[O4 is very close to Black's stronghold, it shouldn't be helped, with that stone you should adopt a 'wait and see' policy. Which doesn't mean that a move around F/G3/4 is bad, but helping O4 shouldn't be part of the plan. Q12 is one possiblility, I guess, you just need to realize that attacking Black Q10 doesn't work now, as it's virtually part of B's wall.\]

[Instead, you may want to consider a light move around N10, for exapmle.\]]
;B[nj]C[[That's the best move, which shows how pressing B's strong positions helps him to turn them into almost real territory.\]]
;W[no]C[Maybe better play K4, or make an approach move around F3

[Yes, a lot better. What's your plan if Black now answers at K4 himself? You can't hope to surround this wall.\]]

(;B[nn]C[[This is unnecessary struggling. I think that K4 is best for Black instead, if he feels in danger he can later connect both from R7 and P3 stones.\]]
;W[jp]C[[Yes, that's a must, away from those heavy O4/O5 stones, into the open.\]]
;B[gp];W[ok]LB[lc:a][fc:b][cf:c][cn:d]C[I didn't want black to have too much territory here, so I came to save my  Q7 stone. Maybe it's too early, and better take big points on the left side or at the top.

[Yes, you're trying to fight in the most difficult area to save one unimportant stone (its key merit had already been used  - letting you play S6 in sente). Moreover, you're bound to hurt either your top right or your bottom center group by fighting here.\]

[Here are some nice points to cosider instead (not in that particular order of importance.\]]
;B[oj];W[nm]
(;B[pl]C[[Bad, connection at P6 is simple, safe and seems to work well.\]

[See variations.\]];W[on]
(;B[ol]C[[Now this is a major hallucination by Black.\]];W[mn]
C[I was quite satisfied because the black wall was not working well now.

[Yes, White is now very happy.\]];B[qe]
(;W[oe]C[[The problem with this move is that, again, White is beginning a struggle in the area of strong Black influence, which means that :
1. White won't find any objects to attack
2. Black will get even stronger here, or somewhere else

In this situation Blacks upper right corner becomes real territory, while White gets a heavy group with no points.\]]
;B[od];W[pe];B[qd];W[mf]C[maybe O13 better?

[I'm not sure, bute also O12 is an option.\]];B[mh];W[ng];B[kd]
C[[Now, the problem is, as I mentioned earlier, that Black got a huge area at the top and White's group is still struggling for safety.\]]
;W[fc];B[hc]C[After this move, I realized my previous mouve was maybe in the wrong side, because it helped black to extend his territory at the top

[Yes, you could have approached from the C14 side, but Black's response here is wrong for the same reason - top side is smaller, now, that Black has already L16 in place and the whole top right corner secured. The left side is all open and unclaimed - bigger.\]

[Instead of H17 I think that Black should have extended to C14 or D14 and be happy in letting White settle on the top side.\]]
;W[fe]C[[This move is trouble. The purpose of this move is to let Black get the C14 or D14 point - as in the game - and in compensation attack the top side, including the H17 stone. Here Black has already a stone at L16 and White can't hope to gain much at the top side.\]

[Instead, you should consider making a double approach at C14 or invading directly at C17.\]]
;B[df];W[ch]C[[OK, that's positive, but now F17 and F15 become weakened.\]]
;B[dh];W[di]C[Better to jump at C15?

[No, you have to play here (D11).\]];B[eh];W[ie]C[[Now White has two groups to look after and abandons the "must" move at C13...\]]
;B[jf];W[je];B[ke];W[kf];B[lf];W[kg];B[lg];W[jg]C[[OK, now White has the upper group pretty much safe, although the ladder doesn't work, but...\]]
;B[cg]C[[...Black gets to play the huge move of C13.\]]
(;W[db]C[[I think this is less urgent than the connection at C11. What if next... (see variation)\]]

(;B[cc];W[ci];B[cb]C[[Small, now's Black's chance to play at C7.\]]
;W[cn];B[cl];W[dm];B[cp];W[jm]LB[dl:a]C[I'm not sure this is a good move or not. Maybe the top is more urgent, around G12 for example. Or elsewhere...

[First of all, K7 is close to White's strongest group, save for the bottom corner one - the N6 group doesn't need any help. K7 doesn't attack or defend, it's not urgent. I think that instead 'a' is the urgent move, it prevents Black from moving out at D9.\]

[G12 is a ladder breaker but if you want to secure the ladder, it's usually better to capture at J14 directly.\]]
;B[gm];W[ek]C[I was afraid of black to escape if I didn't add this move.

[Yes, that's a must now. Still, D8 seems better (tighter, fewer possibilities for Black to manouver.\]]
;B[ei];W[ej]C[[Now the cut at D10 might become dangerous later, that's also why D8 was better than E9.\]]
;B[hf]C[I didn't know how to answer this. If I connect at H15, black car play K17 and I've nothing along the top side.
If I take the K14 stone, black the sequence G16, F16, G15, and my stones at the top left are almost dead.

[I like your plan, it worked quite nicely. However check out the variation after J17.\]]
;W[ic]C[So I decided to take some territory at the top]
(;B[jc];W[ib];B[ff];W[jd]C[[That seems bad - capturing at J14 is bigger. Besides, be wary of such shapes, they tend to get short of liberties. See var.\]]

(;B[kc];W[if];B[ge];W[gd];B[ee];W[fd]C[Bad shape? = bad move?

[Shape is not so much of a problem here, as is the fact, that this move is very small. Instead, there is a very nice move of G2 or G3 for White to look at. If you're not worried about the R14 group, that is.\]]
;B[jr]C[this seems really big. It's like I can't take that stone.

[It's hard to capture that stone, but you can't be hoping for that because the bottom side center was open from both sides and White couldn't have counted it as his territory.\]

[What you can do here is to build strength while attacking that stone and use it to invade Black's bottom left corner, which you did.\]]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[ir];B[lq]C[[See comments at Black 92 in the original game for the variation here.\]]

(;W[mr]C[[That stone is going to be captured.\]];B[mq];W[nq]
;B[nr]C[I knew I could cut. But I was thinking to play so that I can use this as ko threat if needed. Maybe better play elsewhere, such as M4 to stop black.

[You mean you couldn't cut? Yes, there are some ko threats here, but it's a territorial loss. M4 instead of N2 to protect the terrotory? Bad idea, because you may end up in gote.\]]
;W[fq]C[[Good, that's the way to use the J2 stone.\]];B[fp]
;W[gq];B[eq];W[fr];B[er];W[hp];B[ho];W[ip]C[[Both sides make mistakes in this sequence, but White should capture at H2 instead of connecting here, so that F1 atari wouldn't be sente for Black.\]]
;B[gj]SQ[jg][jm][kg][kf][if]C[I gained some points at the bottom, but I'm really bad towards center, and black is getter stronger

[You're not bad towards center, you have the K7 and K13 stones, Black is not going to get many points in the center.\]]

(;W[lp]C[Finally...

[Consider the variation.\]];B[kq];W[rk]C[I was trying to help my stones at the top right, expecting black to connect at R7 and play a second stone around R11

[Yes, you need to help those.\]];B[qk];W[rl]C[I threaten the cut...]
;B[ql];W[qi]LB[ri:a]C[and extend here to help my stones.

['a' is better, because Black can cut you here actually. See var.\]]

(;B[ml];W[go]C[Hum... Doesn't help. Better play M7 to stop black or play around J12 to reduce black territory in the center, or B5.

[B5 is a lot bigger than J12, it's double sente. M7 is smallish. M19 monkey jump is huge and sente. S15 is very big. I'd play B5 first - double sente.\]]
;B[fo];W[gn];B[fn];W[hn];B[hm];W[in];B[em];W[hk]C[I don't know why I play this. Seems really strange.

[You have to answer at D8. Luckily for you Black didn't cut at D10.\]]
;B[el];W[dl];B[bn];W[bm];B[bo];W[ck];B[bg];W[bh];B[il];W[jl]
;B[oh];W[og];B[ne];W[of];B[kh];W[ik]C[Bad. Now J12 or H13 maybe, M7. The monkey jump at M19 is big also.

[Now J12/H13 is bigger than before. Still, smaller than S15 (look what happens if Black plays S14 first - the difference is more than 10 points). M19 is still big and waiting - you have to play such moves, they're sente. Besides, E1 is huge because it's double sente.\]]
;B[hj];W[gk];B[jh];W[ih];B[hg];W[rf]C[better connect at J13.

[Sure, why play J12 if you then let it go? Here, S15 is better, because you can later play T16 in sente.\]]
;B[re];W[ec];B[ig]C[now I can't save the 3 stones if I don't want to lose everything here.]

(;W[he];B[jf];W[hd]C[[Better capture at G14.\]];B[jb]C[[Monkey jump prevented - huge gain for Black.\]]
;W[hb]C[[Not necessary, you loose sente.\]];B[me];W[oi]C[M7 is still better]

;W[hr];B[da]C[[Again, Black plays what was White's sente. You lost a huge lot of points in the endgame.\]]
;W[ea];B[ca];W[co];B[bp];W[an]C[not very big. Maybe E6 or F8. L4 and N4 are better also.

[Right. But E6 is very small, L4 and N4 are better (reverse sente - they prevent sente plays from your opponent) G1 is big and almost sente and before all - A13! K9 is a nice sente move with big follow-ups. Try to find moves which, if the opponent doesn't respond, will cause him a big loss.\]

[A6 is very small, because Black doesn't have to answer, it's 1 point in gote.\]]

C[I think white made a mistake here. If I want to kill the black stones at the bottom I have to win the ko twice, so it won't happen. Better play N9.

;B[pn];W[mo];B[ed];W[op];B[tt];W[tt]C[I lost by 14.5 points.

[Overall, you played a decent, yet a bit chaotic game. After the invasion at R3 Black gained strength and put your groups on both sides in trouble.

Luckily, after capturing at N6 you gained a lot of strenght at the bottom and in the center.

Later comes what I think was the cause of the loss. You created the heavy group of Q15 and friends, and gave Black a huge top. Later you created one more weak group at F17/F15.

Beware of moves like K7, which are played close to your own strong positions and thus serve little purpose, while there are still weak groups to defend/attack. Such moves loose tempo and may cost you the game. 

Now, you lost a lot of points in the endgame. I'm not sure if you could have won if you played better endgame, but you could have been close to that. You missed a lot of sente plays and lost initiative in many spots (eg. H18, K8, A6 and A5, etc.\]

If you, apart from anything else, like calculations then work on your endgame, you'll be surprised how much you will improve, because most amateurs (including myself) are so bad at the endgame.
