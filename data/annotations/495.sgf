;B[pd];W[dc];B[qq];W[dq];B[jd];W[co];B[jp];W[lp]C[ Seems a little bit early to invade - there are still some very big points around.]
;B[np];W[ln]LB[hp:A][hq:B][gp:C]C[ Here I think you must play a pincer, probably at a) or b). Because if black plays c) next you will have a weak group with nothing to attack.]
;B[jn];W[nn]C[ Ok.];B[pn]C[ Looks ok, but doesn't seem to work well.]
;W[oo];B[op]LB[pp:A][po:B]C[ Must be at a) I think, but that is not so good either. Perhaps b) and give up the stone on the left.]
;W[po];B[pp];W[qo]C[ Disaster for black, getting a stone cut off like this.]
;B[pl];W[dj]LB[mk:A][pj:B][hp:C][di:D]C[ I would prefer to come out at a) - then b) and c) are miai. On the left I think d) or a shimari works better - with this move black can play kakari against the corner easily.]
;B[de];W[ce];B[cf]LB[dd:A]C[ Since black can't extent on the left, probably playing nadare at a) would be better.]
;W[cd];B[dg]LB[ff:A]C[ A bit heavy - the normal move is to jump to a).]
;W[ed]LB[ef:A][fc:B]C[ More normal to peep at a) first. If you play at b) you don't peep.]
;B[ff]LB[gf:A]C[ Slow, a) is better.];W[ee];B[ef];W[hd]C[Good. Looking at the weakness of the group on the left.]
;B[ic]C[ Not good - the white corner group is safe.];W[hf]C[ Good.]
;B[ci]C[ Strengthens white, but also gets a base. Moves like this should be avoided.]
;W[cj];B[bi];W[jf]LB[mk:A][pj:B][qf:C][nc:D][md:E][hq:F][hp:G]
C[ Playing from the strong stones is not good. The letters are some alternatives.]
;B[md]C[ Black is happy to secure his two stones while getting some territory as well.]
;W[hq]C[ Good! Although K14 was not so good, one effect is to increase the value of attacking the K4 stones.]
;B[fo]LB[eo:A]C[ Looks like an overplay, and it misses the corner key-point a). (See variations for some possibilities for white.)]

(;W[ho];B[hn]C[ See variation for white.]
(;W[in];B[io];W[gn];B[im];W[go]LB[bk:A][dr:B]C[ This looks fine for black. Note that white is still open at a), and there is some bad aji in the corner after b). But black has to attack the weak white stones on the right, to make use of his ponnuki.]
;B[gm];W[fm];B[fn];W[em]LB[fq:A][dr:B]C[ I cannot read this out completely, but the combination of a) and b) should give black some possibilities here. (See variation for an example.)]

(;B[hp];W[gp];B[gq];W[fp];B[fq];W[ep];B[iq];W[hr];B[ir];W[ip]
;B[fh];W[jq]C[ This is a bit dangerous - black should take the ko now.]
;B[kq];W[jr];B[kr];W[is];B[kp]C[ Black gives up the ko and ends in gote ! At the same time any aji in the corner has disappeared.]
;W[mp]LB[ll:A][mk:B]C[ You should concentrate on the main string of stones here. If black were to play a) next things could get hairy, so I would jump to b). Also: isn't it better to attack the two lonely stones on the right? After all we can't expect to catch the ponnuki stones on the left!]

;B[jo];W[ll];B[jm];W[gl];B[hm];W[jl];B[hl];W[gk];B[ek]C[ ?? Overplay.]
;W[hk]C[ Good.];B[mr]LB[mq:A]C[ Still catching the stones on the right is huge, and black is well in the game. a) would be preferable though.]
;W[ej];B[qi];W[qk]LB[qf:A][qc:B]C[ Again this invasion is in a very narrow space - why not a) or b) ?]
;B[ql];W[pj];B[pi];W[oj];B[qj];W[qf]C[ Now black is stronger below, so this kakari is more difficult.]
;B[qe];W[of];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[qg];B[oe]LB[og:A]C[ Black can cut at a).]

;B[hg];W[rq]LB[ke:A]C[ Better to just play at a) - it is one point reverse sente and makes the ko unimportant.]
