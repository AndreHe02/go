or probe at P10]
(;B[qd];W[fg]C[Still P10 or near seems better];B[cf]C[This is a bad move, as w has played a double space jump, and B 'forces' w to stregthen this gap]
;W[dg];B[gd]C[Taken together, C14 and G16 are too small, as they defend the upper left corner, which is around 20pts. A move like R7 or Q7 is more interesting,]

(;B[hf];W[ig]C[This sequence is very bad for b. He gained almost nothing, and W get a strong wall and has begun to damage B moyo]
;B[rn]C[Very strange move. It is more interesting to play Q2 to see what w wants to do (either keep the corne or the side), and then choose an appropriate move

This move only invites w to flatten b on the side, and expand his moyo]

Cutting here would help to transform K10 into a dame point];B[nm];W[nn]

O15 seems ok, the best that b can hope if to seal w in]
