C[hello dear reviewer, i played as white in this game against 3d player (this was fighting game).

i thought i fought well in the begining but before i noticed i had more weak groups than my oponent so the game somehow went to his favor.
i hope you can help me improve my fighting and help me to understand why i lost.

thanks in advance.

Hello, i will mark my comments with [K\].];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]

;W[nc];B[pf];W[pg];B[of]C[my opponent went out of joseki here so i wasnt sure what to do here so i setteled in corner right away. 

[K\]: I would say connect here. It looks like natural move.]

(;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[ob];B[rb];W[lc]C[good result for W ?

[K\]:If black choose to finish white at Q13 it is probably quite even although black side is very strong then.]

(;W[fp]C[now that im thinking about it perhaps it was better to play 3rd line here? might cause little less problems for me?

[K\]: It usually depends on the continuation you want to choose, see variation.]

(;B[bp]C[[K\]: This move is in most cases bad removing aji of C3.]
;W[cq];B[iq]C[[K\]: This is mystake by black, it seems that black strenght is fighting as this move look more like kyu one.]

(;W[gq]C[im trying not to let B settle by using my E3 weakness and in the same time to keep the two black groups away from each other (double attack)

[K\]: I would say it is better to just cut black stones with G5.]

;B[lq];W[lp];B[or];W[ln];B[ch]C[here is where B started to counter attack and the game became hard for me , how to decide where and how to fight?
would just defending my upper left corner will be enough?

i decided to counter attack his counter attack and it became very complicated.]
;W[cj];B[bg]C[I think you can just settle corner now.]
(;W[bn]C[wanted to settle one of my 2 weak groups right away , but thinking about it now i should've probably jumped into the center instead (either with E 14 or E 9 )

[K\]: This is wrong, black is weaker then you on the board.]

(;W[ef]C[[K\]: Wrong shape, after black plays E19 you sitll have weak point at D15. It would be better to play E15 insteed.]

(;W[jb]C[[K\]: Too small now.];B[eh];W[gf];B[fe];W[ee];B[gh]
;W[if];B[bk]C[somehow my game became disaster , both of my groups went from being ok to very weak.]

(;W[co];B[cm];W[gm];B[km]
(;W[nn]C[N8 instead?

my thoughts here were that i must make myself a living shape.
but looking at it now it also gives B the chance to defend his right side teritory , so i am not sure if to defend like i did or perhaps start new invasion around R 7.]

hope you can help me find my mistakes.

[K\]: The biggest mystake was when you lost sente in L4 and made few bad decisions when defending your groups, especially  B6 which was not very urgent move. Same with K18. You were often quite greedy for points or fast connection while missing big moves on the board. In general he won that game because he was fighting better.]

Going with C9 now would be bit weaker because F3 stone does not stop black infualnce that well.]
