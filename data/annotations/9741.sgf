;B[pq]C[Hi, 

I am HonFu, reviewing your game. Let's go. :-)];W[dd];B[od]
;W[dp];B[gp];W[dn];B[dq];W[cq]LB[fq:A]C[I don't play E3 but play C3 , it is beacuse I don't want a difficult joseki .

*Hon* This is correct. With the usual approach at A, Black would have kept the possibility of a corner invasion. Like this, he is giving it away, making you solid and big, so you can patiently take it.]
;B[eq];W[cr];B[ep]
(;W[eo]C[*Hon* I think, this is not good.

You are leaving an annoying cutting point.];B[fo];W[fn];B[gn]
C[Does F7 is an more important move ?

*Hon* Absolutely! It makes a huge difference in center thickness. If you don't play F7, then the former moves have no meaning.]

(;W[po];B[fm]TR[cp]C[*Hon* So now, your former moves do not make sense. You first leave the marked cutting point to gain something in the center, then you don't take what's there in the center, but leave the nice atari to Black. It is inconsistent.]
;W[en];B[cp]C[Honestly , even if BLACK play Q4 or Q5 , I still can play L3 to reduce some moyo of Black . But , I think Black is high and strong from Left joseki . I am very weak in this opening and fuseki . P16 and Q3 is try to have some moyo .

*Hon* With every move, it doesn't matter in which phase of the game, the first question you should ask yourself is: Am I weak? This is always the priority. From that point you can again see the value of D5 instead of E5: You instantly get absolutely solid and don't help Black to build up the lower side any more.]
;W[do];B[bp]
(;W[bo]C[*Hon* This does not work!]
(;B[pl];W[co]C[It is a move to prevent black to cut my shape and attack my corner .

*Hon* Yes it was a necessary defence. But you have spent two whole moves now for this, getting a disadvantage in your whole board development. Black can attack your Q5 stone now, because you didn't answer his pincer.]

(;B[qd]
(;W[nq]C[*Hon* A surprising move.];B[op]
(;W[np]C[*Hon* This is bad technique: You are forcing your opponent to damage your own stone. This is sometimes called a "family feud": Your different stones are not cooperating, but acting against each other.

Yes, Q5 will probably die anyway ... but let Black spend a move on his own for the kill, don't do it for him!]
;B[oo]TR[po][np][op]C[*Hon* Ouch! Getting cut like this is one of the worst shapes in go!]

(;W[kq]
(;B[on]C[O4 ,O3 and L3 to reduce some moyo from Black .However, White Q5 is dead stone and black has a large right low corner .  I think white(L3,O3,O4) is still safe in lower side .

*Hon* Yes, you effectively destroyed the potential at the bottom. But it came at a price: Black has got a large corner and is looking very nice on the right side!

His last move looks overly solid, though. He is making things too easy for you.]
;W[jc]C[*Hon* Good that you were able to take this superb point first!]
;B[fd];W[df];B[dc];W[cc];B[ec];W[cb]C[*Hon* Very good.];B[hc]
;W[mc]C[*Hon* Perfect: You get the opportunity to make a base and attack the weak point of his shimari at the same time.]
;B[md];W[nc];B[nd]
(;W[qi]C[Is white is too greedy to play R11 or too fast  ?

*Hon* Not too greedy, just plain necessary! This is a huge formation, and this might be the last opportunity to effectively reduce it.]
;B[lc];W[lb];B[ld];W[kc]
(;B[oi]C[*Hon* This is a bad move. You will live too easily, then Black is left with "nothing".]

(;W[qf];B[qe]C[*Hon* What is Black doing? A huge rock does not need to defend himself]
;W[pf];B[qj];W[rj];B[qk];W[rk];B[rl];W[rh];B[pi];W[ph];B[oh]
;W[og]LB[oi:2][on:1]C[*Hon* This move may look the same as F5, but here of course it is okay, because Black can't cut anything.

Black made things way too easy for you with the two soft moves, and now, although you had to retreat in the lower left, are more than back in the game - you are leading it.]
;B[ng];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg];B[nh];W[lf];B[me];W[kg]C[*Hon* You don't need to defend the two stones, they are like flies on the window of a truck. Just let them die there!]
;B[mh];W[lg];B[oe];W[of]
(;B[rf];W[rg];B[se]LB[rf:1]C[*Hon* So what is Black doing now, playing this kind of small endgame move in gote?]
;W[pb];B[pc];W[ob];B[qb];W[je];B[ke];W[jf]
(;B[ch]C[*Hon* Black is behind now and wants to go for the biggest possible reduction.

This is risky, because his group at the top can still be attacked!]

(;W[cg]
(;B[ce];W[cf];B[dh];W[ck]C[Is it possible(C9) ? C15 is useful to cut my shape now or not ?]

(;B[dk]
(;W[dl];B[cj];W[cl]C[Is E9 is more active ?];B[ek];W[el];B[fk]
TR[al][bl][am][bm][cm][dm][an][bn][cn][ao]C[*Hon* You strengthened him for relatively little gain. When you have strong stones, you should not make points in front of it, but instead push your enemy group right against it. 

Try to think of your walls as "cliffs on which enemy ships shatter".]

(;B[or]TR[jc][on]C[*Hon* This is very large, he should probably take it.

But you are right: You are ahead, because he wasn't able to use his influence correctly. Since your opponent didn't know how to attack fiercely, you were able to live quite efficiently at the bottom and the right sides, making up for your mistake in the lower left. So now you will just win the game. I think, his slow move - the marked stone - was an important mistake: Instead of almost passing like this, he should have taken the top, which would have made the business of reducing his moyos a lot harder.

The rest is just endgame, so let us stop here.

I hope this review helped you, good luck with your go!]))
(;W[eg]C[*Hon* So maybe you should try some other move, which he can't just cut off. Now he has to live at the top.]
))
(;W[cj]C[*Hon* I would try to attack the whole group. You don't want to make just a few points in front of your wall, it's not efficient.]
;B[dj];W[ei];B[di];W[ff]LB[ec:1][dh:2]C[*Hon* Something like this. You get two targets for attack.]
))
(;B[de];W[ee];B[cd];W[ed];B[ef];W[fe];B[ff];W[ge];B[bf];W[bg]
;B[be];W[af]C[*Hon* Black can't cut now. Not only loses he the race, he kills his top group in the process.

But he can aim at the cutting point, helping his top group survive.]
))
(;B[dh]TR[ce][cg]C[*Hon* He should strengthen himself and aim at either an extension or the peep. First strengthen yourself; then attack the enemy; if both is not possible, then you can take points somewhere. This is how one should prioritize one's moves.

Bumping moves like yours have to be played very carefully, since they give you a weak point and strengthen the enemy.]
))
(;W[cf]C[*Hon* You might want to just defend safely.];B[ck]
;W[or]C[*Hon* You don't even have to attack him, you can just play endgame and win.]

(;B[mb]C[*Hon* Just for your information: Here is still aji.]
;W[nb];B[kb];W[ma];B[jb];W[ib];B[jd];W[id];B[ic]C[*Hon* So your center group can be cut off!]
))
(;B[oc]C[*Hon* If he plays in the corner, then this move looks a lot bigger, doesn't it? It also weakens your top group.]
))
(;W[rl]TR[po]C[*Hon* Maybe I would start here. You should play away from his strong areas, and the wall towards the top is very strong.

You can also try to make Black capture the marked stone one more time. ;-)]
))
(;B[qk]C[*Hon* He has to try to attack you, making life as hard as possible for you, and at the same time increasing his territory at the bottom.]

(;B[qh]C[*Hon* And if he pincers ...];W[ql];B[qm];W[rm]TR[po]
C[*Hon* ... then you get an opportunity to "sell" your marked stone!

This strangely looking hane is a typical technique to survive on enemy territory, the terms for it being "sabaki" or "shinogi". On first glance the move looks dangerous, like you just get cut; but in situations like these, where the opponent is very strong and threatening with his walls, you don't want to cling to every single stone. No, instead you are prepared to sacrifice a stone or two, as long as you succeed with your major objective: Getting either away or a life and in the meantime reducing his area.

You should take a close look at these patterns, since they occur again and again!]

Anyway, you have to know your decision about what is more valuable already before playing the marked stone! If you don't like this result because you don't like Black growing on the lower side, you should not even start this with E5]
