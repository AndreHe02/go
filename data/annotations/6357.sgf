;B[qp]C[outstander [7k\]: hello, thank you for reviewing my game. i think it was pretty even throughout and no MAJOR mistakes on either part. something to keep in mind however: i was wondering if there was any better way to reduce w's right side, which i let become massive. any comments + variations, particularly in the opening, would be greatly appreciated.

oh yeah, a couple more things.
1) could you please point out the losing move to me? i think it was my letting him unnecessarily have the monkey jump in the lower left.
2) could you recommend me any good go books? i just finished reading 'the fundamentals of go' and found it improved my game a lot. where should i go from here?


Hello
This is first reviev i make for gtl, hope it will be good.:)
Black got really nice start in this game but then he gave little to many points on the right side.

About go books:
1.Any book with tsumego for your level will be good(1001 life and death problems for example).
 2.Also you could study same joseki book(get strong at joseki)-don't only remember moves but try to understand each of them.
3.Tesuji- wrote by Davies.
4. Studying same modern pro games may be good idea as well, but i don't know any good book for it.]

White gets bad shape, he should think about:

;B[mo];W[qk]C[outstander [7k\]: is this move better? i also think that i made a joseki mistake in this corner... true?

Black didn't make mystake in joseki, but the one he choose wasn't good in this situation.]

(;B[oc];W[od];B[nd];W[oe]
(;B[mc]C[This is odd.]
(;W[ic]
(;B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[ph]C[Ok, time to estiminate score.

I would say white has about 25 points at top left corner and about 30 to the left(still not safe points) and maybe about 10 with bottom group.
so total 25+30+0,5+10 = about 65,5 points total


Black has about 32 points at the bottom and about 26 to the left + about 10 to the top
32+26+10 = 68 points. 

So both sides got about equal terytory but black is safe everywhere and white can still be invaded.]

Also  in the SGF i can see that white won this game by 3,5 points but from what i count black is leading at the end. Are you sure you market all dead stones?]
