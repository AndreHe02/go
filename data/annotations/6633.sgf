THIS GAME IS BEING REVIEWD BY NICK SIBICKY (KGS:  NickSib 2d)]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[qh]C[In one of Lance Kemper's public lecture's, a position like this one came up.  I think it was the exact position, but not certain.  The question of R12 or not was the discussion.  If I remember the discussion, Lance told us a story about 2 professional players who disagreed on the value of R12.  Either too small or just right.  For me, I like how it develops territory right away, albeit smallish.



NICK:  perfectly normal.];W[po]C[This was interesting.  I could see how a typical joseki like attaching below at R5 would help white get the ideal shape.  On the other hand, white's group is already surrounded on the top right and black would get a solid territory in the bottom right.  Then again, it look like it would be in gote for black.

On the other hand, black could invade almost right away if white didn't defend right?  So it isn't really gote for black...

On the other hand, black could pinch I guess, but to what end?  That didn't seem very clear to me, so I chose the dullard joseki.]

(;B[qo]C[NICK:  like you just mentioned, this helps w too much.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[nq]C[Here, in hindsight, white could probably defend at P10?]

(;W[dj]C[If he ignores, can't black cause trouble at a later date?]

(;B[jc]SQ[oc][qd][qh][qo][qp][nq][pq]C[Feels like the biggest move - getting a double extension from the shimari


NICK:  nice move....one possible worry is all the 3rd line stones you've played....every stone you have placed is on a 3rd line!  in theory, this should mean easy reductions are possible for w and b will be forced to eventually try dangerous invasion somewhere to win.]

(;W[hc];B[je]C[Am I being too optimistic here?];W[qf]C[now here is where I make my mistakes often in games.

Here is my thinking:

If I do jump out to P12, white can connect under.
R14 is a weak stone and certainly weaker than R10.
So, if I attach to R10 to prevent R14 connecting, I can pressure the white group while building an attack on R14.


NICK:  Yes, these situations are always complicated...but there are easier ways to simplify....ie q13]

(;B[ri];W[of];B[oh];W[mf]C[NICK:  starting a running fight like this probably plays into w's hands....as all of your stones are relatively low and w's relatively high.  in fights, its very important to be mindful of this.]

[mf][nf][of][qf][ng][nh]TR[qj][pn][qn][po]C[NICK:  B god a very good result...but game is not over yet due to w's remaining potential.  Still....b is big favorite after the capture of the marked stones and the the remaining weak group at the triangles.]
;B[fq]C[NICK:  oh dear...
letting w back into it....i would agree that w's potential is scary...BUT don't be fooled...the timing and support for F3 is not ripe yet....the bottom and bottomish right need to be delt with first.]
;W[iq]TR[hq]C[NICK:  correct direction for w....but i would be very tempted to play h3 instead as w....j3 leaves a little too much wiggle room for a future rescue operation on behalf of b.]
;B[fo]C[NICK:  probably not a good idea
your b group is going to get pushed around a little bit, and while its not immediately killable, w is going to be able to strenthn the bottom-right-center area, helping both m3 AND q5 simultaneously.]

(;W[eq];B[er];W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[do]CR[fo][ep][fq]SQ[pn][qn]
[po]C[Bad for white?

NICK:  it seems that this strategy tuns the game into all-or-nothing for w....w can no longer pocket territory with the hope of catching up.  instead...w's game will hinge on attacking this e4 group and saving his own at q6.]

[mo:E][no:B][mp:F][np:A][op:G][jr:1][kr:2]C[premature?

NICK:  i do not like this move for b
First....with the huge wall at left...b gains some interesting invasion points at "1" or "2"
second, it seems like the lettered area has the most long-term importance due to the weakness of the q6 group

by haing b make this type of move, it makes the game easier for w, and doesn't particularly help b.]
;W[lp];B[ko];W[kr]CR[lp][gr]TR[pn][qn][po]C[NICK:  After this exchange....please notice that w has gotten to play m4...a VERY important point in helping the weak q6 group, AND has gotten to play L1 to start to make some eye shape (w g2 is also held in reserve for later)]

(;B[in]TR[io]C[this was a wasted move I think

;W[qc]C[Did this help white in any way?

not important enough...there are still shape defects around o8/n6/m6...as long as b retains eyeshape on left...b will just push around it.]
