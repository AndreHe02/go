;B[jd];W[nd]LB[lc:B][nc:A]C[I didn't really know what to do here. I made an enclosure that seemed useful.

Yes, it limits black's expansion on the top side, but the high stone is vulnerable when black tries to make a base at B.

Perhaps A is better here.

If you are feeling more aggressive you can try to pressure this black group by playing B yourself. This is the point he needs to make strong shape.]
;B[kq]C[Here the tables are turned and he is playing on your shape point!

The difference is that here you can live in the corner];W[pj]

Perhaps, but pressuring the marked stones is good];B[qf]
(;W[og]LB[pf:A]C[I didn't play at a because I thought it would hurt my stone on the side, is that correct? Where should I have played?

This is difficult to choose. There are many options and potential variations. You should aim to use the weak invading stone to build up your strength to attack the black stones below and secure territory in the top-right corner.]

If you are afraid of black being too strong on top you can play at a distance]

;W[fq]C[more kikashi-- this seems like it can't do any harm?

Also bad, unless you have a specific goal/plan.

Remember that in a ko fight these moves become much more valuable than they are now (and in the endgame too).]

Perhaps you should be attacking the unsettled black groups? Especially after you've built up strength all over the board]

Also try to focus on playing moves that will settle your groups quickly (give them a strong shape with one or two moves) and allow you to attack. 

Playing into the centre to make territory is always inferior to making territory in the corners and along the sides. 

Imagine if black had capture the triangled stones, visualize the difference in territory.

Imagine if the stones marked with squares were yours ...

In the future consider your kikashi moves more carefully (A,B,C,D), they may hurt more than they help.

Let me know if you have any more questions or want  me to clarify some of my comments.]
