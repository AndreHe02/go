gofishes [12k\]: hi
gofishes [12k\]: gg];W[pq]C[ArionPS [9k\]: you too];B[dd];W[qo]
;B[qm]SQ[jp]C[i dont think that's a good move, as white can afford to ignore it and attack your corner. Better to play at K4. White can ignore that too, but it is played in the right direction regarding whites corner enclosure and correspondends with your D4-Stone.]

;B[cd];W[db];B[ee];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff];B[dj]SQ[mc][jp]C[this move is too small. Still K4 would be a good idea, or maybe N17. If white gets to attack your upper corner from the left side it is perfect for him due to his big wall.]
;W[eg];B[df];W[eh];B[dh];W[dn]C[not a good move. White should play F3 or O17]
;B[gp];W[cp];B[jq]LB[cp:A]C[you have to react to A... something like C3.]
;W[mp]C[White should ignore K3 und just take the corner.];B[mq]
C[A move in the corner still is urgent, N3 does nothing];W[dq]
;B[eq];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fn]C[another move that doesnt do anything. Now that your eyespace in the corner is lost, an urgent move would be to play around your N3 stone, else white will be able to attack you there and gain strength. Also there are still some big moves around the upper right corner!]

C[C is much to near whites big wall.

Now you have 4 weak groups. Especially in a handi game it is of big importance to try to build very solid groups which cannot be attacked easily, as your opponent is stronger at fighting.]

 in general. of course there are local exceptions

MY COMMENT AND QUESTION TO THE "Go Ladder sensei":  What move can kill w 121 or prevent it from creating a living group... What are possible sequences here?
2. WHY is 121 such a good move here? I don really understand.... some examples??
THANK YOU.

Comment:

I have never seen this move... if it is at all playable surely depends on the situation. For example if black is very strong around it will only work as showed in one variation.
This move is just the biggest move still left on the board, that's why it is good at this point. Another big point for white would be to jump into the corner at B18 or maybe play K5, but this one here is certainly bigger.

As your left side is open (3d line) i cannot think of a way to kill white. this move is very painfull, black should have tried to play around here first, something like C8 to close the side. One possible, very defensive move would be to close your side with A. Of course white gains much territory then, so only play it if you are leading by much.

Ergo there is no "standard" way to react, B11 and K8 can both be played, depending on the situation.]
;B[cl]C[gofishes [12k\]: that was a hard one
ArionPS [9k\]: yes :)
ArionPS [9k\]: good response

gofishes [12k\]: dunno
ArionPS [9k\]: that is number one];W[ai]C[gofishes [12k\]: yay

ArionPS [9k\]: a11
gofishes [12k\]: aah
gofishes [12k\]: ok
ArionPS [9k\]: but that would have been more difficult

ArionPS [9k\]: or maybe you can be
ArionPS [9k\]: sorry, havn't read the situation myself, just placed the stone :)]

gofishes [12k\]: really?^^];B[ag]C[ArionPS [9k\]: better than me I think, but I might have more practise]
;W[di];B[cj];W[bj]C[gofishes [12k\]: no don think so
gofishes [12k\]: but i yes i like to analyze^^];B[ei];W[lb]
;B[mb]C[gofishes [12k\]: one min
ArionPS [9k\]: That is good :) I play mostly by intuition these days, but that is due to things beyond go. Analyzing is good way to learn]
;W[nr]C[gofishes [12k\]: gonna be right back
ArionPS [9k\]: ok
ArionPS [9k\]: no hurry, i'll google :)
ArionPS [9k\]: I think the best way to learn go (and don't take my word since i'm only 9k) is to play a lot of games and get a feeling for what moves are appropriate, and get a sense of good patterns. Then combine that with solid reading and analysis
gofishes [12k\]: ok^^
gofishes [12k\]: aah
gofishes [12k\]: yes
gofishes [12k\]: playing much is great
gofishes [12k\]: only porblem is that i don have much tim e to play seriously
ArionPS [9k\]: So if you like to analyze you have a good start
gofishes [12k\]: hehe
ArionPS [9k\]: well, that is a common problem:)
gofishes [12k\]: yeah
gofishes [12k\]: hm
gofishes [12k\]: thats what i wanted to do right nmow
gofishes [12k\]: o1 or something
gofishes [12k\]: but now you took sente
ArionPS [9k\]: :) take it back somewhere else
gofishes [12k\]: ill try];B[ml]C[ArionPS [9k\]: another good thing is to watch other games. maybe not dan-games, because they might be to complex. but maybe like 3 steps above your ranking]
;W[mm];B[mk]C[ArionPS [9k\]: auch
ArionPS [9k\]: you had me there
ArionPS [9k\]: m7];W[lm]C[ArionPS [9k\]: but maybe better safe than sorry

ArionPS [9k\]: depends

ArionPS [9k\]: yes, if you live];W[np]C[gofishes [12k\]: ok

gofishes [12k\]: the ko "fight"
ArionPS [9k\]: hehe
ArionPS [9k\]: well, in this case it is only 1 point we fight over
gofishes [12k\]: ^^ exactly
ArionPS [9k\]: but in pro-games ko-fights often decides the game
gofishes [12k\]: yeah
ArionPS [9k\]: but it's quite a funny thing
