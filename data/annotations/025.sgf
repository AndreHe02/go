 rich 23k*: *bow*];W[dp]C[
 chrisg 20k*: <bow> :)];B[dc];W[pp];B[oc];W[de]L[pj][qj]C[Rob - While there is nothing wrong with 6, I feel that it if you do not take the big point at a or b, then

you should make a special effort to come out of the upper left joseki with sente, and play it then.  It seems to my 15k brain that those points opposite the 3-4 5-3 corner enclosures are VITAL to avoiding a major moyo development by your opponent. (Note: these comments are made before I look at the rest of the game, so it may not be relevant to what *did* happen..)]
;B[cd];W[ce];B[gc];W[qj]M[ce][de]C[Rob- Excellent, I think..You do leave some real room for attack on the upper left group, but r10 is very large.]
;B[cn];W[cj]C[Rob- very nice for w here. b has good development on the upper side, but w has gotten a little security for his UL.]
;B[fq];W[fp];B[eq]
(;W[dq]L[ep]C[Rob - My feeling here is that the only move when b does e3 is a..See variation 1..]
;B[ep];W[do];B[ch]
(;W[dg]L[dh]C[Rob - I think I might have played a here. See variation 1..]
;B[di];W[dk];B[dj];W[cl];B[gi];W[gf];B[gp]L[hp]C[Rob - I don't like g4 for b much.. I think a is better. g4 forces w to make a move that he really doesn't mind making.]
;W[fo];B[jp];W[go];B[hp];W[fk];B[eg];W[ef];B[fg];W[ff];B[cg];W[bd];B[bc]
;W[dd];B[cc];W[fd];B[fc];W[ec];B[eb];W[ed];B[jd]C[Rob - b played live and let live here, and that's ok. k16 seems to carry out that strategy well. Given the state of w's UL group, I'm not sure he could resist much more strongly than he did.]
;W[hd]L[mq]C[Rob- I'm not sure I like h17. w has an eye, and a route to the center. Also, b's center right group is no stronger, so w in very little danger. I would have tenuki'd, and...maybe a..]
;B[hc];W[gg]
(;B[dh]
(;W[df]C[Rob - w MUST not respond to this atari. b capturing that stone has very little effect on anything. In fact, w still has aji to remove b's eyes, (though in gote) See variation 1. I'm not saying w should play variation 1, but that d12 is not a move that w should respond to at all, since it doesn't  a) threaten w, b) secure b's group without at least 1 more move, and maybe 2.]
;B[gh];W[fh]L[eh]M[df]C[doesn't work


Rob - Worse, it would have worked if b hadn't connected at the marked stone. Even if b connected at a, f12 would have spoiled b's shape.]
;B[eh];W[hh]C[Rob  Again, h12 is not urgent...Take sente..];B[bf];W[be]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[bi];W[ah]C[Rob - a12? :) b has an eye at f12..];B[af];W[id]
L[hg][mq][oj]C[Rob - This just helps b build a bit more territory.. The cut at a is secure. At least one eye is secure. Tenuki, darn it! :) Take b or c!]
;B[ic];W[hi];B[gj];W[hj]L[qf][mq]C[now looks like a good time to take a big point like 'a' or 'b' instead of playing here

Rob- Now why didn't I think of that? :) b is better than a, IMO..];B[nq]
C[Rob Good move for b. Ouch for w..];W[pn];B[qh];W[gk];B[fi];W[dr]L[lp]
[oj]C[Rob d2 is way too slow right now. a or b are the moves to consider, I think.]
;B[er]C[Rob - b really should not have responded, though b is ahead..and being secure makes sense..]

(;W[ej]L[lp][oj][oe]C[Rob- This is pure aji keshi. You force b to make a move to live..No reason to do this. Again, a, b or perhaps c, if you want to reduce b's potential..Not sure if w can afford c though..]
;B[ei];W[bm]L[oi]C[seems like a pointless move.  I wanted to ensure my territory here. maybe 'a' would be
bigger?


Rob- Yes, a7 is WAY too slow.. w is down, he can't afford to make moves to secure won territory..]
;B[en];W[eo];B[el]
(;W[dm]C[Rob - In my opinion, w must a. variation 1 explores a..];B[ek]
;W[em];B[fj];W[fm];B[pq];W[qq];B[pr];W[op]C[another small move.  seems I lost this game by making small moves instead of big ones]
;B[np];W[no];B[qr];W[rq];B[oi];W[io]L[mi][jf][in][oj][oe]C[wasted move.  'a', 'b' are much bigger.  if I want to play here 'c' seems better


Rob Agree..You should not play in this area..a would be bad..b would be better..I feel that w almost must d here..e is getting very difficult, but not impossible yet.]
;B[if]C[Rob - This is really a nice peep for b..];W[hg];B[ip];W[lp]L[oj]
C[Rob m4  doesn't seem to do much..You can't seal b from the center because j5 is too weak..a is probably better.. Use the thickness you have..]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[kq];W[gq]C[Rob- Uhh.. :)];B[gr];W[jg]L[oj]C[again a small looking move


Rob- This move isn't all that small, but it isn't big either.. Again, a is better..]
;B[ql]C[Rob - This is really a strong move by b..];W[pk];B[qk]L[pj][rj]
C[Rob - This is not as good a move for b..if w a, I'm not sure I see where b can go..I think I would b, and end up with a BIG move in sente..]
;W[oj]L[pj]C[Rob - This is wrong. You must a.];B[rj]C[Rob- but, w makes a mistake, and it works out well for b..Very hard game for w  now..Almost impossible.]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[pl];B[ph];W[pj];B[qm];W[qn];B[ni];W[nj];B[ho]C[Rob This is why m4 was wrong. w is too thin..]
;W[jo];B[hn];W[im]L[jm]C[Rob - a is better..];B[in];W[jn];B[jm];W[km]

(;W[kc]C[by now I noticed that b was going to win since he had a huge upper right.  I was trying

to decide how to invade or reduce it.  What do you suggest?  This attack didn't work for me.

Rob - variation 1 is the best I can suggest..];B[kd];W[nc];B[nd];W[mc];B

 rich 23k*: good game chris, thanks


And I resigned the game here.  My invasions failed and there is no way my center moyo could compete with his top (seems his bottom and my left similar size)


Rob- This was a good place to resign. A few notes: Try to concentrate a bit more on the actual status of your groups. Don't make moves to support groups that aren't really weak.  This type of thinking will keep you from getting behind in the first 50 to 75 moves..Gotta make sure to get your share of the big points.    Stop at  several points to count. Maybe move 50 and move 100. Perhaps more frequently if you don't feel you have a handle on what the status of the game is. I realize that it isn't easy to guess what your thickness or the enemy's thickness is worth, but give it a shot. The important thing is to know when you have to invade (because you are behind), and when to grab some points or solidify.    I should clarify: When behind, you can (obviously) catch up by invading or by taking big points..Building thickness (like m4) isn't so good at that point, because it is too long term, and requires sente (For a moyo builder like p10 or so..), which your opponent may not grant you. :)


This was a better game to comment, as your opponent, chris, played well.. For the most part, you played fine, just realize that a few slow moves at the beginning can kill you. That's why you see those strong players often taking a long time in the fuseki.. They know that fighting is great, but if your opponent is the same strength, you can't always win fighting from a disadvantage.. Sorry about the length of these comments, happy going! :)]
