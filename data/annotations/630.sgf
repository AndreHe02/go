AB[pp][dd]C[This is the wrong arrangement for the handicap stones. White's lower left corner should always be open in a 2 or 3 stone handicap game.

(Note: closing comments after last move)];W[dp];B[qd];W[oc]
;B[ld];W[pd]C[Not a good choice in a handicap game.  Burying oneself in the corner this early looses the initiative.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[rc];W[qb];B[qh]LB[pg:a]C[To work with B4 this move can be played at 'a'.  This B10 does not seem to relate to B4 too well.]
;W[rb]LB[nq:a][cf:b]C[Very slow. White's group is in no immediate danger.  Because of the handicap W is already behind. 'a' or 'b' is better.]
;B[fc]LB[jp:a][fq:b]C[B does well to resist the temptation to answer W11.  However, this is not the direction to play.  Because of W3 black is not likely to make a lot of territory at the top while. on the other hand, B4 is high so in no danger. Because of this, a move along the top is not urgent for either player.  'a' looks interesting. 'b' is also good but B needs to be able to deal with a pincer.  All-in-all 'a' or 'c'  is good enough because of W's slack play at the top.]
;W[qn]LB[nq:a]C[This cannot possibly be good unless W can get an attack on the B stones in the upper right.  This seems very unlikely so W ends up invading in a cramped position. Approaching at 'a' is better.]
;B[ql]LB[np:a][rp:b][qq:c][qk:d][jq:e]C[Not exactly bad, but unnecessary.  If B simply follows the sequence 'a'-'e' he is good enough as W has little room to expand on the right.]

(;W[qp]LB[nq:a][on:b][qq:c]C[This move is not likely to get  W very far. Each of 'a', 'b', 'c;' are better.  See variations for each.]
;B[qq]
(;W[rp]LB[po:a][rq:b]C[This is a heavy move. 'a' and 'b' are joseki.  See variations.]
;B[rq];W[po];B[op];W[qj]C[W cannot get away with this.  He already has 4 weak stones below and this just creates another W group. B can anticipate a double attack.]
;B[ol];W[nn]
(;B[oo]LB[on:a][mp:b]C[Aji keshi. Without this move B can later aim at 'a' to seal W in (see variation at b).  Playing at 'b' is simple. See variations.]
;W[on];B[pm];W[pn]C[This doesn't help B as much as W.];B[lp]
LB[mp:a][pq:b]C[Better to hold back at 'a'.  This move leaves bad aji between B20 and B28 when combined with the cut at 'b']
;W[oj]LB[mp:a]C[Essential.  W has the move at 'a' to reenforce the lower stones.]
;B[ml]C[B needs to be careful here. He must not get too thin.  Because the 24-28 sequence strengthen W more than B black finds his position weaker than it should be.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[ro]LB[ln:a][jp:b]C[This is a handicap game. W cannot afford to lose sente so easily.  On the other hand 'a' will be answered by 'b' and that does not look appealing for W.

This whole sequence, from 24 to 33 is strange.  It seems as if each play is trying to lose the initiative.]
;B[oh]LB[ri:a][sl:b][sm:c][sn:d][qm:e][sp:f][mo:g]C[B may have overlooked the move at 'a'.  Because 'b' threatens to kill the lower group in ko (with 'c'-'f') a B move at 'a' is as good as a connection.  This could be useful in the ensuing fight. Anyway, because of this the stones are the top are in no danger and any attack against W21 and W29 can be delayed.  I would try a move at 'g'.  This tentatively connects all B's stones and makes Bb even stronger.]
;W[mj];B[lk]LB[nl:a][sl:b]C[B has to be very careful here.   As he discovered later, there is a weakness at 'a'.  Now is the time to play 'b' to see how W responds.]
;W[rk]C[Nice move.  Prevents the connection described earlier.]
;B[sm]LB[sl:a]C['a' is better.  It serves the same purpose but does not fill in B's own liberties.]
;W[sn];B[sl];W[qm];B[mh]LB[ri:a]C[Try 'a' first];W[ni];B[nh]
;W[lj]
(;B[kk]LB[nk:a]C[B has to play 'a' first, threatening a cut.  See variation.]

(;B[ok]C[Wrong connection.  See variation.];W[mk]
(;B[oi]C[See variation.];W[nj];B[pj];W[pk];B[pi];W[qk];B[kj]
;W[pl];B[li];W[om]LB[ki:a]C[B has been completely outplayed here.  The variations show that there he plenty of opportunities to win the game by keeping the W stones separated.  Even once the stones are gone there were opportunities to get a better result.  In particular, the cut at 'a' is annoying.]
;B[id]LB[fq:a][dj:b][cn:c][fp:d][dn:e]C[Too small. There is not a lot of territory at the top.  'a' through 'e' all look bigger.]
;W[ck]LB[mp:a][mq:b][lq:c][nq:d][kq:e]C[Counting the game at this stage shows W has 20 points on the R, 5 at the top R.  B has 15 pts at the lower R,5 in the upper 5. In addition B has at least 5 more points at the top than W has on the left.  B also has a lot of center thinckness.  So W cannot expect to win with moves like this.  He has to find somewhere to either start a fight or to gain more territory.  The only place where I think W can cause trouble in this game is by playing 'a'-'e'.]
;B[fq]C[Stops the sequence suggested  at the previous move.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[cn]C[W65 and 67 are contradictory.  Never play 65 if you intend to follow up with 67.  In this case it also solidifies the bottom for B.]
;B[ip]C[More than adequate.  W should be starting to think about resigning.]
;W[ch]LB[kp:a][gc:b]C[Far too slow.  This is no way to win a handicap game.  Especially when behind.  Desperate measures are called for.  Something like 'a' or 'b', neither of which are particularly good - bu!
!

 W is to win.....];B[dg]LB[ce:a]C[Nice move, although the simple move at 'a' is adequate.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ce];B[de]LB[cd:a]C['a' is better. W cannot do much harm by pushing at 74, especially is B secures the corner territoy.]
;W[cc]C[An overplay, as B's answer shows];B[cd];W[bd];B[bc]
;W[bb];B[be];W[ac];B[cg];W[bf]C[W does not have the time for this.  He is playing gote yose when he is way behind.]
;B[bg];W[ae];B[dh]LB[mc:a][ln:b][ei:c]C[Far too slow. 'a','b','c' are all nice points.]
;W[bh]C[Where is the microscope?];B[di]LB[ej:a]C[If B is playing in this direction he should at least play 'a']
;W[ki];B[kh]LB[ij:a]C[This is a move inside B's own territory!  We can assume that W89 cannot live in the midst of all the thickness. 'a' is better.  Where is W going to find eyes.]
;W[ji];B[ik]LB[ij:a]C[Wrong shape.  Should be at 'a'];W[jh]
;B[kg];W[hi];B[hg]LB[gk:a]C[Keep the pressure on with 'a'.  If W lives above then B make a large territory below.  And there is no guarantee W can live.]
;W[jg];B[jf];W[ij]LB[gj:a][hk:b]C['a' is better.  99 just forces 'b' which is not good for W.]

;B[fk];W[ei];B[dk]LB[gh:a][mc:b]C[This cannot be expected to achieve much.  Just finishing off the game is the best way to play now.  I recommend 'a' in sente, followed by 'b']
;W[ek]
(;B[dl]C[Why not block at 'a'. See variation.  There is no need to try to capture W.]
