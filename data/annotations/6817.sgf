;W[qp];B[jd];W[qk];B[jp]C[rs220675: P4 is very important. Don't let blacks K4 settle to easy.]

(;W[cj];B[gq];W[nq]C[rs220675: good.];B[lq];W[mo]LB[cg:B][dn:A]
[fp:C]C[rs220675: This move is good in itself, but if you see the whole board you'll notice a weakness between your stones D4 and C10. If black invades there - which he did - then you have not trouble, but you are in defense and have to react. That's not good considering black's moyo on top. So play at A to D (all good possibilities) to strengthen your weak stones.]
;B[cn];W[hp]LB[cg:A][fp:B]C[rs220675: Not a good move. You have to take care of C6 first. Also your move at H4 can be cut off very easily by black. Remember: If you connect your stones, you'll be fine even if you don't look at territory. Most games at your level are lost because someone kills big groups and that cannot happen if you look to connect your stones resp. not having weak groups. And here you create THREE weak groups: D4, C10 and H4.

Better play at A or B.];B[hq]C[rs220675: Black does you a favour by not cutting.]
;W[ip];B[iq];W[gp];B[fq];W[fp];B[bp];W[eq]LB[cf:B][qf:A]C[rs220675: That move is too small. Look at your board and how many big moves there are still possible like at A or B. Moves like that make a lot more points at the end then your move. If it's not a necessary move to survive or avoid weak groups then ALWAYS go BIG.]
;B[cq];W[jo];B[kp];W[ko];B[er]
(;W[ok]LB[ch:B][qh:A]C[rs220675: Ok, but a bit small again considering black plays at A or B. Look at variation....]
;B[cf];W[en]C[rs220675: Too small again. Don't hang too much on C10. You can easily sacrifice this stone when you are able to make other big moves.]
;B[dl];W[ch]LB[qf:A]C[rs220675: A classical mistake I also did when I was weaker: To hang too much on weak stones instead of sacrificing them. At A would have been the better move.]
;B[ge];W[ei];B[fg];W[bl];B[bn]C[rs220675: Well, now you live there on the left side, but black is big on the top.]

;W[hm];B[mq]C[options88 [7k\]: that wa a accidental drop];W[oq]
;B[qg];W[qc]LB[gh:B][nh:C][ph:A]C[rs220675: Black played some weak moves in your favour. Now I wouldn't play R 17, because of what would happen...see variation.

Better play at A, B or C. Later you can still invade at R 17 and C17.]
;B[pc]
(;W[qe];B[qd]C[rs220675: Ok the rest of the game there have been too many mistakes, so I end here. What you need to do is play bigger moves in the beginning of the game.

When considering a move then ask:

1. Is it necessary to live or avoid heavily weak groups? then play there.

2. If it's not necessary to live or cause heavily weak groups then play a big move instead.]
