C[JRH: Hi, I will be doing your review and I'll be using my initials for my comments on the game-branch.]

(;B[or]C[JRH: This move was a bit slow.  White is already alive so it's not urgent.  Better to play on the left side somewhere or on the bottom to build a moyo]
;W[sq]
(;B[jc]C[Thofte [4k\]: maybe this was a bad move, since it made white's invasion later possible

JRH: This move is fine, it just depends how much you like fighting!]
;W[en]C[JRH: This was a good idea by white and reduces the potential of your moyo.]
;B[ci]C[JRH: Good.];W[cg];B[cl];W[eg];B[ei];W[fl]
(;B[qi]LB[ld:A]C[JRH: Playing at A first would make your life a bit easier, while also getting you points.  Black doesn't have to worry about White's stones on the right. They can't really make territory and there's nothing for White to attack, so White's not going to waste moves on them right now.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[ph];B[qg];W[qj];B[qf]C[JRH:  Black gained quite a lot here.  But now White's stronger in the center.]
;W[nc]C[Thofte [4k\]: this move surprised me, but it seems to have been a good move...]

(;B[od]C[Thofte [4k\]: I played nobi here, because I didn't want to give white any aji

JRH: I think this response was fine.];W[lc];B[je];W[mf]
(;B[md]LB[hc:D][nf:A][jn:B][dr:C]TR[jc][je]C[JRH: I think this was a questionable. move.  It hurts the marked stones.  I think it wouldbe better to try to cut around A instead.

In any case. I think you worried too much about these stones right now.  The game's alright for you, so you can think about taking time to develop your moyo with B, play C (which is big) or make some eyeshape at D. D may be the most urgent.]
;W[ld]
(;B[nd];W[id];B[jd];W[le];B[jg];W[gi]LB[fh:A]C[JRH How about playing at A instead? Or another option: Just tenuki. It's going to be hard for White to kill these stones, at least to my eye.]

(;B[el]C[This isn't quite right.  If you want to live, you should either escape, or make eyespace.  The easiest way to make eyespace is to play on the side/corner.]
;W[fk];B[ek];W[fi]
(;B[ch]LB[bh:A]C[JRH: This move helped white. and didn't really help your eyeshape.  Better to play at A]
;W[bf]TR[fi][fk][fl]C[JRH: These exchanges made White much stronger.  It's much harder to attack White's stones on the right now.]
;B[ng]TR[fi][gi][fk][fl]C[Thofte [4k\]: probably a bad move again, only making black's group in the center weaker....

JRH: It's hard to attack this way now.  White has built up a lot of power in the center with the marked stones.]
;W[lh];B[ji];W[ol];B[lj];W[ni]LB[hq:B][dr:A]C[Thofte [4k\]: Here I didn't know what to do next
Thofte [4k\]: so I connected F3, to prevent an invasion

JRH: Bigger to play at A instead of B.  It's a pretty close game still.]

Thofte [4k\]: the group is alive, I think
Thofte [4k\]: so black should've connected

JRH: Yes that's true.  You lost about 10 points here.  You were leading by a little bit, but this puts you little. behind.

As a side note  I would have considered tring to attack the stones at the right by connecting at A.  The shape isn't great, so you might be able to find some weakness on them.  If nothing else: it's points in sente!]

JRH: It's not necessary to attack immediately.  Since those stones are high, they can run away quite easily. A better strategy would be to find an attack to gain points elsewhere.  Pressing at B, for example, helps develop your moyo, but you need another stone at A before that strategy is going to work super well.]
