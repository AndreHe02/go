C[This is a tournament game from an Esperanto-speaking league on KGS. I would like to get some pointers for improving my opening especially. I'm Junesun, but most of Aralsa's plays looked reasonable to me, too, if you have any comments on those.


Hi Junesun,

I'm Felix and I'll review your game.
Main focus is on the opening. Therefore I state three basic principles, which I'll check on every move during the opening.

Three Basic principles for finding the biggest move in the opening:
Principle 1: Defend/Settle your weak groups.
Principle 2: Attack while making profit.
Principle 3: Play on the biggest side, the area with the widest space. Occupy corners first.

I made suggestions for both sides. If you have further questions, feel free to contact me.

Best regards,
Felix];B[pd]C[Aralsa [9k\]: dankon bonan paartion

;B[cq]LB[eq:A]C[#Now Black's 'A' stone became weak. Black has to defend (Principle 1). Principles applied correctly.]
;W[bq]C[#Again, White has to defend (Principle 1).]
(;B[cr]LB[dp:A]C[#Black is defending. Principle 1 is applied correctly. But usually Black plays at 'A', which is joseki. See variation.]
;W[br]C[#White defends his group. 1st principle applied correctly.]
;B[di]LB[jd:C][qn:D][gq:B][br:A]C[#Black should not play away from the bottom left corner. Because White played at 'A', Black can be attacked seriously at 'B'. Therefore Black's group is weak and has to be settled first. (Principle 1).
Even if the black group is strong. Black should play in a bigger area (Principle 3). This would implicate a move around 'C' or 'D'.]
;W[dk]LB[jc:B][qf:C][gq:A]C[#White's group is safe. So there is no reinforcing move necessary (principle 1).
The attention should be on the weak black group in the bottom left corner. White should play at 'A' to attack (principle 2). If this move is not obvious, then at least White should play in a bigger area (principle 3). That means second best moves are 'B' and 'C'.]
;B[cj]LB[jd:C][qn:B][hq:A]C[#Bottom left group is still weak, so Black should play there first (Principle 1). Second best option would be follow principle 3 and play 'B' or 'C', which are the biggest sides.]
;W[ck]C[#Locally the last two moves are good, but you both miss the big picture: Weak black group in the bottom left and the big sides on top and right.]
;B[jq]LB[hq:A]C[#Good. Black defends his weak group (Prinicple 1). Allthough I would prefer it closer at 'A'.]
;W[mc]LB[nc:A]C[#Playing on the biggest side is also good (Principle 3). The usual approach move is at 'A'.]
;B[qf]LB[oc:A]C[#Settling the corner is correct, following principle 1. With the two space low approach move, the defense at 'A' would be more common.]
;W[jc]C[#White is settling his group, correct! (Principle 1)]
;B[gc]LB[qn:A]C[#There are no weak groups to settle or to attack. So Black should look for a play on the biggest side (Principle 3). Therefore 'A' would be the best choice (9 empty lines, on the top only 5 lines).]
;W[nq]LB[qm:B][qn:A]C[#The same for White. Moves like 'A' or 'B' would be better, because they are on the bigger side. (Principle 3)]
;B[hp]C[#Black is right to defend his group on the bottom, following principle 1.]
;W[qm]LB[qk:A]C[#Very good. White playing on the biggest side (Principle 3). Personally I would go further to 'A'.]
;B[qi]C[#This is why White should have gone further. Black gets a very nice extension for himself. Correct move, biggest empty area (Principle 3).]
