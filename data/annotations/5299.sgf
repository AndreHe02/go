AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,

I was white in this match. Through the course of the game there were many times where I thought I was winning by a comfortable margin, but during the middlegame I lost much of what I thought was mine and eventually lost (thanks in part to a poorly played yose and a couple of misreads). I'd like to know where I went wrong, as I'm unable to do more than theorize.

We also reviewed the game afterwards and found some plays we didn't agree on, I'd appreciate your opinion on them, as well as in moves we didn't notice were bad.

Thanks in advance.

Hi. Im Tobias
Im a european 2kyu from the netherlands. 
It took some time to get this review finished but i tried to think carfully about what to say.
I hope you don't mind.
All right. There we Go];W[po];B[cd];W[ed]C[Tobias:
I remember my Go teacher (Guo Juan 5p) saying about the high approach move that you should only play it for a good reason. Most of the times the low approach is better. So whats the reason here?
With the high approach move white says to be more interested in influence than territory.]
;B[hc]LB[qf:A]TR[cd]C[Tobias:
This is a very rare pincer. Actually its not a pincer at all. The idea of a pincer is to put the approach move under sharp attack but thats not the case here. White can simply tenuki and play A for instance (thats what I would do).
In professional play you'll see this constallation just as an invasion with the marked stones already in place but never as a "pincer".]

(;W[dg]LB[df:B][qf:A]TR[dp]C[Tobias:
Wrong direction.
White should leave the situation for what it is and play A.
If the marked stone would be white playing at B would be possible (see var.) but not D13.]
;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc]
(;W[fe]C[Is there a better sequence? I felt this result was good for black.

Tobias:
The sequence was ok except the last move.
If you connect solid at A black cannot make a connection. (see var.)]

(;B[op]LB[fb:A]C[This move was unexpected to me. Did I play the following sequence right?

Tobias:
This is a bit strange move. 
Black A is HUGE (see var.)]
(;W[pp];B[oq];W[oo]C[Point of discrepancy. My friend considered this move as somewhat slow, but i thought it was just fine. What would you say?

Tobias:
Just fine];B[qq];W[pq];B[pr];W[or];B[nr];W[qr];B[os];W[rq];B[no]
;W[nn];B[mo]
(;W[iq]LB[qf:B][mn:A]C[Was this stone well placed? I think something like g3 would've put white in trouble.

Tobias:
Again wrong direction. Youre creating a weak group.
I would push once more with A to make black overconcentrated and then play B. (see var.)]

(;B[jp]LB[mn:A]C[Tobias:
Black is alive at the bottom right so this move is to slow giving white too much room to play with. 
A is urgent for both sides (see var.)];W[fq]C[I think i should've used the shoulder hit to make my stone stronger first.

Tobias:
Where do you see a shoulder hit for white??
Black played one with K4.];B[jq];W[cn];B[fp];W[gp];B[eq];W[fo]
;B[fr]LB[ep:A]C[Tobias:
Mistake by black. Connecting at A is much better.];W[ep];B[cp]
LB[en:A]C[I wasn't sure what to play next here. Is the left side worth reinforcing or was it ok to play elsewhere?

Tobias:
I would play A to make a thick solid position. That would also give back a meaning to the white stones at the top left]

(;W[qf]
(;B[md]LB[qh:A]C[Was this double space jump ok or was it too loose for black?

Tobias:
I guess a pincer at A would be the best here. (see var.)];W[qc]
C[Tobias:
Good! Thats the weak point of the 2 space jump];B[pc];W[qd]
;B[pe]
(;W[pb]LB[og:A][en:B]C[Tobias:
This is abit early. A is much better or still B];B[ob];W[qb]

(;B[kc]LB[fb:A]C[Tobias:
Better the long awaited connection at A. It does the same job... making the upper side black.]
;W[pj]LB[bf:C][og:A][en:B]C[Is there any better move? We were discussing a move around j6.

Tobias:
A or B or C...];B[ph]C[Tobias:
Ha you see...];W[qi];B[ol]C[Tobias:
Looks like an overplay];W[og];B[oi];W[oj];B[ml]
(;W[ni]LB[mn:A]C[Tobias:
A is important to keep black seperated and weak (see var.)]
;B[pm]
(;W[qm]LB[om:B][qm:A];B[on];W[pn];B[om]
(;W[id]C[Tobias:
White has invested so much in the left edge so why not finishing it off with A. That would leave no aji and solid 60 points!]

(;B[jl]LB[ql:A]C[Tobias:
Of course A now... (see var.)]
(;W[fb]LB[fb:A]C[Tobias:
Good!];B[ic];W[jd]LB[bf:A][en:B]C[Tobias:
Better at A or B. 
J16 was just a forcing move and has done its job. 
Dont make it heavy.];B[di]C[Tobias:
Good spot!];W[ce];B[bd];W[ck];B[bi];W[db];B[cb];W[dd];B[eb]
;W[ek];B[bf]C[Would've f11 been better?

Tobias:
No. This is thick and steady.];W[eh];B[gd];W[ge]C[Tobias:
Ha.. how can white ignore this???];B[fd]C[Tobias:
Yeah!];W[hd];B[gc];W[ei];B[if];W[ig]C[I didn't like the result of the following sequence, which would've been a better choice?

Tobias:
With this move white says: "I want to block off the center" but thats exactly what white is loosing in the sequence so...]
;B[kf]
(;W[jf]C[Tobias:
...don't play here. Follow your own plan and block the center. (see var.)]

Now black has the center.];W[jc];B[jb];W[er];B[dr]C[Yonkit [17k?\]: I was happy to give you stones to take chunks of land away]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[eq];B[ds]LB[cr:A]C[Tobias:
This is bad. Better just connect at A];W[es]C[Tobias:
You see. White gets a sente move for free.];B[br];W[lg];B[lf]
C[Tobias:
Whow... Both of you like to ignore a peep. Whats so bad in just simply connecting??]
;W[kg];B[lh];W[jh];B[ji];W[jg];B[ld]C[Tobias:
Broken shape for black just of the ignored peep.];W[ii];B[ij]
;W[hi];B[kj];W[ch]C[This sequence ended in gote, which I regretted later.]
;B[bh];W[ci]C[Tobias:
You make it gote yourself. Just play tenuki now.]
(;B[qn]C[Tobias:
No need to cut here lfor black (aji keshi). All black wants is to plkay R8 so just play that. (see var.)]

No need to cut here lfor white (aji keshi). All white wants is to plkay H2 so just play that.



Ok. I'll stop this review here otherwise it might never get finished. :)
