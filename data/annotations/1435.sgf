C[Hello unknown reviewer!

First: I hope my english is understandable. i try my very best, which is not much. If you want you can review it, too ;-)

I made some remarks about the game to give you information about my thougts and to ask some special questions. But all other remarks are also welcome, of course.

I played white and are 9-10 kyu in germany and 11 kyu at nngs, where this game has happened.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[dc]C[Is this playable?

Yes.];B[qk];W[co];B[jp];W[jd]LB[ce:A]C[I thougt about A instead, but this would give black a  giant moyo at the right, if he played at k16.

8 does seem better than A.];B[ce];W[ch]C[Now a very ugly fighting in the upper left  occurs.  what is joseki in this and the following situations?

At your level it is time to start studying joseki.  Your  move is fine.]
;B[cc];W[ee]C[12 is odd; Hane at 2-3 point would be better.]
;B[dd];W[ed];B[ec];W[db];B[cb];W[eb]C[Move 18, crawling on second line (especially this early  in the game) is bad.  Sacrificing two stones is better.]

;B[jb];W[ia];B[ca]LB[cg:A]C[Should this be at A? Than the black corner group is  alive and white has lost the game. correct?

Not big difference, but A or one space right of A are  okay.  Black does have better game at this point.]

"A"  looks better.];W[fh];B[bc];W[af];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[gh]
;B[di];W[dh];B[ej];W[eg];B[dg];W[ei];B[fa]C[If i dont answer the Ko-Thread. I loose the semeai.  Korrekt?
(see the variant)

Answering the Ko threat is okay.]
(;W[ga];B[eh];W[fg];B[ci];W[bg];B[bi];W[ad];B[cm]C[At this point i was heapy to win the fight in the upper  left. But it look like i'm much back in influence. So,  what to do? I decided to invade.

Invading is good now.];W[qf]LB[ok:A][ji:B][gq:C][qn:D]C[is maybe A a better point to reduce the influence? Or  should i simple somewhere in the center around B? Or  take territory with C? Or invade at D?

B is not so good.
C is too small for now.
A and D would be okay, but 76 is probably better.];B[qd];W[qi]
C[This was bad because of ...];B[ok]LB[ok:79]C[... this. correct?

Maybe the marked places make fast life, but your  one-space jump is okay also.]
;W[of]LB[kh:A]C[Maybe this is not necessary and i should had played a  move in the center around A?

"A" is not urgent now.];B[qo];W[nd];B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[me]
;B[nc];W[md];B[jj];W[nf];B[mc];W[hq]LB[gq:A]C[Is this extension to long? Better at A?

92 looks better than "A" because of strong shimari and  undercutting hoshi point.]

;B[cp];W[do];B[cq];W[dr];B[bp];W[bo];B[br];W[aq];B[kn]C[Now blacks giant territory at the lower right is complete. At this time i am behind. correct? What is going wrong in the past to allow this?]

(;W[ac]LB[gj:A]C[Should i cut at A instead?  See variant.

Your move is not necessary, so play to reduce lower  right territory is better.]
;B[ii];W[hh];B[gj];W[ba]C[I am very fearsome about my centergroup. maybe i  played on or two moves to early this semeai.

Count liberties and see who is longer, rather than play  from fear.]

;B[jn];W[al]LB[ck:A]C[This is gote. But i thought i can something do with the  cut at A.

Good fighting spirit.];B[ap];W[ao];B[ar];W[cr];B[bk]C[Hm. until here it works in sente. the next move is gote. correct?]
;W[ak]LB[re:A][rj:B]C[This should be at A than B. With this both endgames i  dont run in the problems with my right group later and  should be able to win. correct?

;B[qj];W[pi];B[sj];W[ja];B[lb];W[jf]C[Mabe instead i had to invest another move at the right.]
;B[kf];W[jg];B[jh];W[nq]C[this is mainly desparation. normaly it should not work.

Agreed.];B[oq];W[np];B[lp];W[nn];B[nl];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko]
(;B[kp]LB[jo:A]C[Better at A? See variant.

"A" is better.];W[jo]C[I decide to take some points and leave the invasion  dead.

Yes - only choice.];B[mo];W[io];B[no];W[mn]C[More desparation.]

Yes - rescue stones is better.];B[if];W[na]C[this dont work.

Correct.];B[mb];W[kc];B[oc];W[mg];B[mj];W[lg];B[lf];W[lh]LB[mf:A]
C[Should i play at A to avoid complications?

No - your move is better than "A"];B[mf];W[li];B[lj];W[ki];B[kj]
;W[se];B[sd];W[sf];B[qe];W[pf]LB[qg:A]C[Now, i smell the coming complications. But i should  play at A to secure. correct?

You are too afraid of nothing.  White is in no danger  here.]
;B[sh];W[sg]LB[rg:A]C[Again. Should be at A.

Yes - "A" keeps white alive.];B[qh];W[si];B[gm];W[hn];B[sh]
;W[qg]C[i decide to make things secure instead of playingthe  ko. but it was mainly a emotional decisison. but i think  there are no white large ko-thread avaiable. correct?

All these problems are because 236 was not at "A"];B[rg];W[ph]

C[that was it. i lost. but why? give i two much influence  away in the opening? lost it in the endgame? play the  center-semeai to fearsome? what you think?

Thank you for all your hints!

1.  You make too many unnecessary moves out of  fear.  Counting liberties in a semiai is essential.

2.  Crawling on second line at beginning was very bad  start.

3.  Not invading or reducing lower right early was also  critical to this loss.]
