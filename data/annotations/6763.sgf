AB[pd][dp]C[Hello and thank you for reviewing.  I think I was doing well to the piont where I let one of my groups die and had to resign.  Also I want you to tell me on your personal opinion of my rank. thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Dmitri plays black.

NR: Hello. My comments during this review are preceded by my initials, "NR". I hope the review helps a bit :)

Overall comments: Avoid to play passive moves. Try so that each move has at least 2 purposes (e.g. connect your stones and separate the opponent, or defend while attacking, or reduce opponent territory while increasing own territory).

Don't be afraid to cut and study a bit the cross cut move.]

that seems slow to me now

;B[nq];W[lo];B[no]TR[nq]C[NR: Here you have created a weak group for yourself (I think this is the group that you eventually got to lose..). At the same time, you are forcing white to attack your group on the left, which is also still not so strong.]

;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[jb];B[nb]TR[pb][qb][rb][qc][qf]C[i think this was a good invasion

NR: OK, but if you had played P17 first, you would not need to invade... See variation at move 61. Position as at variation 64 is preferable to current position. It's a similar position, without the marked exchanged stones.]

NR: You are right. You should look for Ko threats. Though it would seem that white has bigger threats than black.]
;W[jf];B[kb]C[Why not connect at L19

NR: Because connecting cannot secure 2 eyes. White would eventually die; just bigger.]
