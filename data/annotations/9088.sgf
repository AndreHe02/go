Hi David,

I'm Sisyth your reviewer. I'm 5k on kgs, keep that in mind when you read my comments, I just hope they will help you to become a better Go player and enjoy Go even more !

I use some japanese terms, if you do not know them, see http://senseis.xmp.net/?JapaneseGoTerms

My comments will begin with some dashes.

If you do not have a stone at A, and black takes the corner, it is considered bad to block at C4. So you block at D3 like in the game. In this case, you can consider a wider pincer like B, C, eventually higher like D, E, or even larger. That might be better in this case, as you can combine with an approach to Black shimari.]
;B[cq]LB[cp:A][dq:B]TR[dj]C[--
Black gets the corner. As said you can block at A or B. A is considered bad in this situation because there no stone around the triangled point.

So B seems sensible.]

(;W[cj]LB[cl:B][cn:A][kq:C]TR[fq]C[--
Because of the stone at A, this side is not that interesting, and there is the aji of the F3 stone.

B is a standard move to bother black, but probably too early in the game.

C is probably the good move (standard defensive move). If black plays here he gets a play that attacks you and extends from his shimari. A good move for Black. So avoiding that seems a good move.

C10 is not good as :

- it does not defend one of your group
- it does not really attack Black
- it does not really make points ^^

When you have the sente a good rule of thumb is to :

- DEFEND your weak stones
- attack your opponent weak stones to gain something (power, points, ...)
- take big points

in this order !];B[jq]C[--
Black gets the point ^^]
(;W[ho]C[Is this the wrong response? Should I maybe have L3 instead of C10?

--
You have to do something to avoid Black doing something like the variation. If your goal is to separate Black, your move is not good. J4 is better (see variations). You should be more active. J4 attacks more the black stone. You can consider K3 to stabilize. And probably a counter pincer that will lead to a complicated fight. 

I tried some variations ...];B[jo]C[--
Black is happy with his moyo as you only have a small group with some aji left...]

(;W[nq]C[--
Well, when dealing with a moyo, you are to be cautious. You can reduce it or invade deeply. When invading deeply you must be quite sure you can live, as black will end with thickness. You have to consider the weaknesses you can use , etc.

The problem with your move is that black can push you against his tobi while securing his corner territory. A tsuke (contact move) is usualy better in this sort of situation. The way to go is usually to make 'sabaki', play light moves. It is a hard concept to grasp, but the idea is to be ready to sacrifice stones to gain something in an hostile environment ...

See variations.];B[oq]C[--
Here black has the corner points, and will chase you gaining something ...]
;W[kp]C[Maybe this move first? I was trying to find forcing moves for use when invading.

You have a really weak group (squares), the first thing is to DEFEND it. Your other weak group if not that weak should be watched upon. A Black move at A will split you and threaten your two groups.

Ok. That's an important moment in the game. Your groups are alive. Black's groups too. It is the beginning of yose. First thing to do is to COUNT ! Then you can choose a strategy. If you are winning, play moves that win you point without risks. if you are loosing, you have to try some risky invasion/reduction to change the outcome ... or abandon if not possible ^^

Here black has more territory and a possible moyo in the center. Hard for you ^^

I feel my endgame was better than it normally is but I was screwed up by having the weak groups. Though they all lived, i didn't get enough territory and B profited from it.

--
Yes. I rea that some experts estimate that a weak group is about 20 points worth for your opponent ^^

Remember : 

1. DEFEND your weak groups. You can eventually afford one, not two ! If your opponent has a weak group and you one it's ok. If you have a weak one, your opponent will get something from it ^^

2. ATTACK your opponent weak groups. Of course. Beware ! Attacking is not killing. It is gaining power and or territory while forcing you opponent to live. 

3. Take points, only when your groups and your opponent's are strong.

Plus :

- If you find moves that make two or more things play them !
- Do not answer your opponent small moves, or stupid move. take sente !

Enjoy !])

Another standard joseki, blocking the other side. Usually considered bad for white if there is no stone around A. As white ends gote, black can do wariuchi  around A and negates white's wall.

As you have a strong corner, it is not that bad, as I think you can attack strongly a group trying to settle around A.]
