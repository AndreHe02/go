C[Hallo,

thank you in advance for reviewing my game :). I have detailed questions, but if you see some other issues feel free to point that out. I just need a review for black, so you don't have to check out white.

Hello, I see you play on KGS and I do also. My username is dN21death[2d\] on KGS. Since I'm only 2d my advice won't be that great for a 2k. :P If you have any questions though you can message me on KGS.

Attacking as you seem to also see was your biggest problem.
You should start coming up with ideas about what you can do while and after your attacking. The more longer you can attack something is usually a good thing. Playing in the opponent's sphere of influence might also be a problem for you but I'm not totally sure with that.

Good Luck.];B[pd];W[dp]C[rs220675 [2k\]: hi];B[pq]C[chunholee [1k\]: hi,re]

(;B[qe]C[I can't say this isnt a good move but I just feel S9 is 1 spot too far. 
You still had a good chance to attack after though.];W[pf];B[nd]
TR[jd]C[rs220675: Do you like the marked black stone or is it better to play this move on line 17 because of the white marked stone? I just wanted to put as much pressure on the white invaders as possible since because of the marked white stone there isn't much potential to build territory by just expanding anyway.

When you attack white you probably want to build into the bottom right and centre. I wouldn't see you making much in top because of K16. If you played lower I think it would have defeated the purpose of why you contacted in the first place in this situation.]
;W[oe]C[This move just helps you fix the weakness you had. You should thank white. :P]
;B[od];W[mc]C[Odd placement by white I think.]
(;B[md]LB[qh:A]C[rs220675: After reviewing the game myself I don't like this pushing move here. I'd like to play at "A" now.

1. Do you agree?
2. After "A" white will certainly jump out somehow. Should black try to secure the area around R17, push white aggressively or can black even play somewhere else. Maybe you can give me a sequence here, just that I get a feel. I often have problems with weak groups. Either I push too hard or too weak, either I'm too impatient or too patient. I just have no timing.

Pushing white then attacking isn't as bad as you think though finding new ways to attack without giving white as much is a great way of improving.
The push here helps your attack a lot actually.];W[lc];B[ng]
;W[pi]
(;B[ok];W[oh]C[You have a chance to still attack white he isnt alive yet.]

(;B[de]C[You are already pincered when you play here so you can't think of getting off easy.]
;W[cg]C[I think this lets you off too easily but then you tried to do much more. Some ideas shown.]

(;B[ec]C[rs220675:

1. Is this move ok or are there better moves?
2. Can you show me a sequence where black can settle quickly?

This created a bad situation for you. If white wasnt on top as well then this move could of done much better.]

C[rs220675: After studying this I came to the conclusion that white can live inside and black has two weak groups. That looks freaking bad for black...do you agree?

Black is in big trouble.];W[ef];B[bc];W[bb];B[bd];W[bf];B[ab]
;W[be];B[cd];W[gd]
(;B[hc];W[fe];B[fc]C[rs220675: Can one say that the white group is dead for sure locally?

I read a seki at this point.]
(;W[mq]
(;B[kq]C[rs220675: Is this the best move?

You can try capping since the right is what you want to make into territory. The bottom is small now since white played N3.]
;W[no]LB[ln:B][lo:A]C[rs220675: Here we go again: How does one fight a weak group. I certainly messed it up again by play contact the next move and make my opponent stronger. After reviewing the game I'd like to play at "A" or even "B".

1. Are that the right moves?
2. How should black exploit the white weak stones? Can you give me a short sequence how you would have played and what would have been your strategy behind it?

Well they're different ideas depending on how you want to attack. 
You might even try to kill part or all of white here.
"A" is a good forcing move to cut but when you do cut it leaves a weakness.]

(;B[nn]C[I can see you want to build your right but this is a bad way to do it. :P  Not sure why white didnt hane next though.]
;W[lo];B[mn]C[Free move for you.];W[jo];B[ln];W[ko];B[hp]C[It's not a good sign when you're attacking and you end up in gote fixing your weakness.]
;W[mf]C[rs220675: Here I was afraid that my top black group could be in trouble, so I played at R17.

1. After reviewing I think my top group is alive and white can't take away two eyes in the corner (so that my group would be weak). Is that right?
2. If it's right, where should one play instead?

You can always get eyes later. You still have space to jump out plus jumping out helps eliminate some of whites moyo which will be building soon.]
;B[qc];W[hn]C[rs220675: Here I looked at the board and thought: "Crap :), white is building a big moyo and I have no potential to invade or reduce". R17 seemed already to give me great disadvantage.

1. How do you see the situation here for black?
2. What moves would you have played here?

From here on feel free to point out the heaviest mistakes. I don't have detailed questions from here on since I certainly should concentrate on fuseki to avoid mistakes that only bring me in situations like that.]

C[No need to capture, though it looks nice. :P

I end the comments here. Some of the game left is pretty big but that was reductions mistakes, dieing when trying to caputure, etc.]
