(;B[nc]CR[ic][ie]TR[lc]C[Attacking the northeast corner doesn't look like it will be very profitable to for you.  White can easily slide south along the fourth-line and get tons of territory.  By keeping the pressure on the marked white stones, you can build a better space for your running attack.]
;W[le];B[ne]LB[pe:A]C[Playing here just lets white take territory on the white without doing anything to secure your stones.  White A is obvious.]
;W[pe];B[ke]LB[ng:A][pg:B]TR[le]C[In the position you're in, all you can do is run at A, which provokes a white response at B, which isn't to your benefit.  Keep in mind that the marked attachment strengthens white.]

(;B[mf]CR[pc][pe]TR[ic][jd][kd][ld][md][ie][le]C[This is problematic.  Breaking into white's eastern fortress is more urgent than containing the triangle-marked white group.  It isn't settled yet, whereas the white stones marked with circles are the true local threat.]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[jg];W[kh]C[Again we see weak diagonal relationships between your stones.  Contrast this with the strong, connected look white has.]
;B[jf]LB[ph:C][dm:A][gp:B][mp:D]C[The life or death of those two stones are not worth as much as the moves labled A through D.  Play the most urgent moves first.]
;W[jh]
(;B[di]TR[dp][kp]C[You've got the right idea, but the marked black stones are weak.  You've created more opprotunities for white to attack.]
;W[ig];B[mg];W[dl];B[ph]LB[cc:D][cn:A][gp:B][fq:C]TR[dp]C[Would a move at D6 be better? Why?

P- your move is a good invasion that threatens to steal from white's territory while strengthening your fleeing stones, but a move that attacks white while expanding your own territory has higher urgency. Aside from D6 there are other moves that might be more profitable, labled A-D.  Keep in mind the Southwest corner is still vulnerable to a 3x3 invasion.]

You ended up here because you were trying to defend instead of attacking and defending with the same move.

You should use this opprotunity to strike elsewhere, A through D are good candidates.  D is probably the most urgent, at it at least provokes a predictable response from your opponent while strengthening your position.

P:  I would have resigned here as well, there's no way for black to catch up at this point.    Your last moves in the northwest corner seemed hurried and your cuts appeared to be blind.  There were many urgent moves that you overlooked, this could have turned out to be a fairly close game if you played more calmly.  I see the timer for this match is set to 10 minutes, I'm not sure if that's accurate or not, but you might get a lot out of playing matches with 30-40 minute time limits and taking more time considering your moves.  A lot of the time, simply imagining where -you- would play if you were white would have allowed you to sidestep some of the pitfalls that came up in this game.  An adage that's repeated often is "Play where your weak stones are strengthened and your enemy's weakest stones are weakened further" (paraphrased).  Considering the urgency of the move your making is also very important, try to make moves that you think will force the enemy to respond in a way that benefits you.  This is harder to see earlier in the game because of the wide open expanse.  Corners, sides, center.  That's the order of urgency.  Combine that with remembering to make moves that force the enemy to respond in a beneficial or neutral way -first- and you'll be playing at the 10k level like a boss.  GG!]
