C[comments by adum 3k*

i made comments for both black and white in this game; hopefully both are useful.

a couple of general comments: if moves are relatively small, make sure they're sente at least.

try to make moves with good shape.

try not to get pressed into a low position. in two corners, white got a low position with small territory, and black made out much better on the outside.]

(;W[qf]C[usually you should make one more move from the three stones to support them, although i think you're okay here because black's weak in the corner.]

(;B[qh];W[qj]C[this is a good move which serves as an extension as well as working in the corner]

(;W[mp]C[this move looks a little weird. if you want to play around there, one space higher is better. N4 leaves weaknesses, and because black is so strong, it doesn't really threaten the black corner.

if you're trying to build a wall here, saving the Q13 stone is essential, and because that's so big, you should probably play that first.]

;B[fb];W[eb]C[slow. it's not threatening anything, and the corner is alive without this]

(;B[li]C[this is premature. there's a proverb about never peeping where you can cut. since you can cut here, even if you don't want to cut now, you shouldn't peep, as it reduces the cutting aji.]
;W[lh];B[fi]C[black has tried to wall off a big territory. but it's still open on the side. reducing this should be a high priority]
;W[pi];B[ph]
(;W[mq]C[much too small. black is strong in the corner, so this move is not sente. the territory it tries to make at the bottom is much smaller than black is about to make in the middle.]
;B[np]C[unnecessary];W[no];B[mo]C[why push and cut? better to just make territory. if black has a weak group here, white can attack it and ruin the left side.

at this point of the game, think about relative territories. black's ahead, clearly, so no need for risky attacks.]
