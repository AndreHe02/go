AB[pd][dp]C[dear commentator,   could you please tell me something about my own comments, if my view of things was appropriate some times, and when it was wrong.  what do you think about my playing, i felt a long time quiet comfortable, until i wanted to kill the UL group instead of attacking and making influence. to my point of view this was the deciding mistake in the game.   thank you for all your comments and your work!

greetings from Duumvir!

 buckyyowza: hello. comments by Mark Fyffe (buckyyowza 7k* igs).  it is a pleasure to review your game, and i hope you enjoy looking over my comments.  i will comment primarily for black, but am also inclined to point out deficiencies in white's game that black could have exploited.  please don't hesitate to ask questions if i am not clear at any time.  find me on igs as buckyyowza or k946... you can also send email to buckyyowza@home.com.]
;W[pp];B[dd]C[*ydwx27*: U too];W[nd];B[nc]LB[pf:A]C[is this a move which corresponds with the other black stones?

buckyyowza: this helps white build toward the center, which is white's most valuable asset in a handicap game.  it seems a more apropriate joseki would be A (q14) because it develops good shape more quickly and takes the initiative by putting pressure on white's stone.  in light of this, o16 may not have been a good idea for white at all but your move fails to take advantage.]
;W[mc];B[oc];W[jd]
(;B[qf]LB[md:A][pf:B]C[buckyyowza:  this is too slow, by failing to exploit the weakness in white's shape and playing a low territorial move, you have lost the advantage of having two handicap stones after only 8 moves.  perhaps taking the cut at A (n16) would be best since white is extremely vulnerable there (see var on 7).  if you prefer more non-aggressive play, B (q14) is a better solid play and leaves you with more potential.]
;W[pj];B[cj]LB[og:A][mp:B][md:C]C[buckyyowza: white is perparing for battle, and this is not. c10 is not big enough to counter the thickness white is building with territory, and fails to disrupt any of white's shape. i'd be more inclined to play a knight's jump off the established corner group like A (p13), or a high approach to the lower right like B (n4).  after q10 especially, the cut at C (n16) is also still available.]
;W[fc];B[fd];W[ec]C[whats the correct answer here?

buckyyowza: e16 is correct.];B[ed]LB[mp:A]C[i thought building a wall would harmonize with the c10 an d4 stones

buckyyowza: nicely. the high approach at A (n4) would be a logical next step. white's play with f17 and e17 seem inconsistent with his fuseki and give black an opportunity to beat him to developing the center with a distinct territorial advantage.]
;W[hc]LB[dc:A]C[buckyyowza: an excellent time to play A (d17).  this would take significant benefit in the upper left while threatening a cut at g17 and therefore taking sente as well.]
;B[jq]TR[cj][jq][qf]C[so now i felt quiet comfortable

buckyyowza: your plays on the third line (r14, k3, and c10) are out of harmony with white's stones.  that is they are quite passive and small while white's plays are aggressive and fairly ambitious.  this is analagous to not beliving that white will actually attack... a bit of a poor judgement when taking handicap stones. the hoshi double-wing is nice, but envision the board with the stones at d10 and k4 instead]

(;W[fp]LB[np:A][nq:B]TR[jq][dp]C[what is a good move here?

buckyyowza: i'd be inclined to counter-approach the lower right with A (o4) or B (o3). white is likely to live and cut k3 from d4, leaving k3 alone in thick white moyo.  doing something with k3 would handily prevent this. the high approach would reduce the influence white has (that is helping f4), while the low approach would hint of rapid development and reducing white's potential in the lower right corner.]
;B[dn];W[cq];B[dq];W[co];B[do]LB[cp:A]C[buckyyowza: while this is an excellent result for black, cutting with A (c4) would be even better. white's stone at f4 is very lonely and his center influence is all but gone; with no potential in the lower left, white would be in a bad way.]
;W[cp]C[buckyyowza: but now white is just fine.];B[gq]LB[jo:A]
[li:B]C[again, i felt good, having a strong wall and a good attack against the white stone while making a base for my k3 stone

buckyyowza: you are certainly in good shape, but even so without the stone at g3. in fact, g3 provokes white a bit while he is still thick and is a bit of overplay. perhaps you'd be better to play with a little more emphasis on the center since you are strong on the edges. a jump to A (k5) would be nice to put pressure on f4, and a floating move like B (m11) would make nice use of your thickness from the two walls while putting sufficient strain on white's.]
;W[fq];B[gp];W[fr];B[dr];W[fn]C[buckyyowza: this was brought on by g3, though since white extended too far, you can punish with a cut at f5]

(;B[go]C[buckyyowza: since the cut at f5 worked before, this is aji keshi.]
;W[fo];B[cn];W[bn];B[bm];W[ao];B[br];W[gn]TR[mp][np][nq]C[whats a good continuation for black?

buckyyowza: help the lower side group, try approaching the lower right corner.]
;B[fj]C[wanted to use my wall to build a moyo

buckyyowza: a bit late for that now, white is back in control of the game. i'd be more concerned about the lower side (see comments on previous move).]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[hr];W[ho];B[gr];W[io];B[mq];W[kq];B[kr]
;W[jp];B[jr];W[lq];B[lr];W[mp];B[nq];W[np];B[jj]LB[og:A][jf:B]
[oq:C]TR[kp][hn]C[i played here, because i wouldnt have liked a white stone at this place at all

buckyyowza: not a bad idea. you would still be able to get into white's moyo in the upper left quadrant with something like A (p13) or B (k14), but the lower right would be a difficult area for you.  you could accomplish as much with a nice territorial gain by playing C (p3) first. also note a few nice cutting points (l4 and h6).]
;W[ce];B[cg]C[i thougt this is the right side to attack, pushing him against my wall; but at the c 16 point there was not a wall...

buckyyowza: c16 would be better here. white's stone is very poorly placed and c13 fails to take advantage of that.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[cc];B[db];W[cb];B[bf]C[i wanted to take his potential eye space away; is this the right move, or should i give him corner territory and play for influence, maybe with d14?

buckyyowza: d15, actually. he's certainly alive in the corner at this point, best to enclose.]
;W[df]C[i didnt liked this move at all...bringing a lot of nasty problems

buckyyowza: d15 on the last move would have prevented this.]
;B[ff];W[eg];B[fg];W[ei];B[fi];W[ej]LB[qn:A][pl:B][qp:C]C[i wanted to kill the white group, but i failed, and therefore i lost the whole game; maybe i should have attacked him, without trying to kill him, playing for a moyo in the center, building with k14?

buckyyowza: i wouldn't say this is a losing position for black. perhaps a trade would be more apropriate. try invading the right side at A (r6), countering white's thick areas with B (q8), or maybe invading the lower right with tsuke at C (r4) would be good compensation for your loss.]
;B[ac];W[el];B[em];W[fl];B[fm];W[fk];B[gm];W[hm];B[dk];W[ek]
;B[hk];W[dl]C[this was a critical point in the game, i didnt know what to do, and i think my variation was bad..but i wanted to stay connected

buckyyowza: c8 is urgent. see var.]
(;B[dm]C[buckyyowza: c8 was urgent, and protects against a cut. in fact after c8, you would seem to have stolen the white dragon's potential for life.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[al];W[bi];B[ci];W[bk];B[bh];W[bj];B[dh]
;W[eh]C[buckyyowza: f12 is urgent now.];B[dg];W[ef];B[cf];W[de]
;B[di]LB[be:A]C[buckyyowza: this is unnecessary and rather heavy. better to play A (b15) to prevent white's next move.]
;W[be];B[ae];W[ag];B[ah];W[af];B[ad];W[fh]C[so now he attacks my two weak groups, and my hands were full to save them both

buckyyowza: yes, you are in quite a tight spot here. any of c8, f12, and b15 would have prevented most of this.]
;B[gi]LB[hg:A]C[i know, bad shape, but what else should i have done?

buckyyowza: in order to win the game, you often need to sacrifice a few stones. try jumping to A (h13) and letting f11/f10 alone since they're not very important.]
;W[gh];B[hi];W[gd];B[ge];W[hh];B[hf];W[ig];B[if];W[jf];B[jg]
;W[jh];B[kg]C[buckyyowza: why not force your way out at k15 instead?]
;W[ie]LB[gl:A]C[is here a chance to survive for black?

buckyyowza: I see little hope for the upper left. I'd start looking for a big trade (right after connecting at A (g8)). the right side is ripe for invasion.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[id];W[ic];B[he];W[je]C[i think at this point i should have given up the whole f15 group and try to stay in the game with taking care of my h11 group, trying to neutralize his influence from the bottom white group k4.

buckyyowza: yes. looking for big points in the less established areas is also important to staying in the game (the right side for example).]
;B[jc]LB[kh:A]C[bad move, leads to nothing?!

buckyyowza: could be tesuji, but that is a bit beyond my reading ability. A (l12) would be a nice idea to keep the fight alive in the upper left.  you'd still lose your stones, but their aji could turn out to be beneficial.]
;W[kc];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[hb];B[ke]C[again, bad move, i wanted to do something against his influence here, but he answered good, i think]
;W[kd];B[mj]LB[gl:A]TR[rj][pl]C[trying to make eye space for my weak group, at the same time attacking the stone at q10

buckyyowza: why not connect at A (g8). white has no hope in the lower left corner except the a7 ko, so that connection would guarantee life for your weak group. it would be better to attack q10 from below (s10) or from something like q8.]
;W[kh];B[qi]C[again, expanding, while attacking

buckyyowza: the lower shoulder hit is almost always a bad idea. this forces white to take big points in the lower right and damages your potential to connect your center group to anything strong.]
;W[lg]LB[qj:A]C[buckyyowza: white should have played r10];B[pl]
C[do you think, this is the right point to attack the lone white stone?

buckyyowza: yes :)];W[qm];B[ql];W[pm];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[qo]
;B[qr];W[pr];B[ro];W[rn];B[rq];W[so];B[sp]C[wanted to make a ko, because i thought the group was dead

buckyyowza: your group would have been fine  if s3 were at t4... even now the ko is to your advantage.]
;W[rp];B[ee]C[bad, i know! i thought i could make life here!? :(]

;W[qc]C[damn, i couldnt fight him at this point, but it must be possible?!]
;B[rd]C[what is the right move for that situation?

buckyyowza: this is correct.];W[am];B[an];W[qd]C[i thought i couldnt win the ko, so i took it

buckyyowza: the ko is too big to lose, but so is the upper right.  better to lose dramatically than to give up without a fight.]
;B[bo];W[re];B[qe];W[rc];B[rf];W[sd];B[rl];W[pi];B[ph];W[pc]
;B[od];W[ne]C[ok, the game is over, but it took me a few more moves before i saw that the black f15 group was dead anyway]

;W[ca]C[:-D]
(;B[qb]C[is there a chance to make dual life at least? maybe with p19 first?

buckyyowza: a nice plan, but white has too many liberties.]
;W[qa]C[at this point i realized, that i had lost! :-D

buckyyowza: yes, though you put in quite a game ;-)

it seems that your biggest problem is that you fail to recognize cutting points. there were several instances throughout the game where you ended up cut by simplying failing to connect at the right time, and others where a good cut could have really put the hurt on your opponent.  all in all, though, you played rather well against your opponent. the situation in the upper left was just due to a short series of unfortunate oversights.  concentrate on life&death, and especially on staying connected and i think you will see a dramatic improvement in your game.

i have enjoyed going over your game, and i hope you have enjoyed my reveiew as much.  please try not to take my comments too hard or too seriously, we are all learning and i am by no means an expert... as i said if anything is unclear, feel free to contact me by email or look for me on igs. i am always happy to help out or play a game. :-)]
