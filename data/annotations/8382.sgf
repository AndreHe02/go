C[Hello Derric,

This is a game with some interesting swings; I'll do my best. Where I wish to show a variation, it will be marked in advance "see var", usually with a comment at the end of the variation.

There are several points in the game, for especially black but also for white, where a better choice could have been made if you were aware of who was ahead.  You do not succeed at go by "Trying to win by 100 points".  When you are well ahead you must not embark on unpredictable fights that could lose a group.  Conversely if you are behind you have to make the game complicated rather than just take big points.

You started well, lost a lot in the middle, then overhauled black right at the end.

Counting is a difficult art but at 12kyu it is time to start practicing it.]

(;B[qq]C[If black had simply captured O3, the result would slightly favour black, see variation.]
;W[mp];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn];B[rp];W[nr]C[It is recommended that a stone caught in a ladder be captured at the earliest opportunity.  The reason is that black will choose his moment and make a ladder breaker at the most painful time, as happened in the game!

Especially since there is a weakness at Q6, which may be exploited later.

Move 20 is only a fairly large yose play and not important right now.  It does not threaten to kill the corner.

Capturing the ladder stone NOW gives black a modest corner completely hemmed in by a very thick white formation - good result for white.]
;B[df]C[Black tries a ladder breaker.];W[ef];B[de]C[Black is pushing his head into a wall - bad move.]
;W[ee];B[dg];W[cd]C[Good. This is enormous. Takes territory, undermines the black position and defends against the cut at E16.

White is now significantly ahead, with a good result in both corners.]
;B[fg];W[jj]C[If this is intended to protect the ladder, just capture!

Another approach is to play a big point down either side, so that O4 ceases to be a threat as a cutting stone. (Cutting two weak groups is valuable; cutting two strong groups is irrelevant). But I still prefer to capture.]
;B[dk]TR[qf][fq][jd]C[Black : A two-point jump to D10 would have been normal and would have avoided the problems that black had later.

White : I can see that you are looking for a fight here, and it is true that black has some weakness.  But early in the game, when there are large open spaces, it is usually more profitable to get the first move there, rather than going for a localised profit as you did with the push at this move.  The triangled points are all obvious options, working well with your wall in the bottom right AND with the tengen (K10) stone.

You don't have to panic about black building territory on the left side if you can gain better territory elsewhere.

The push-and-cut will still be available later.];W[eg];B[eh]

(;W[bf]C[See variation];B[cg]C[Black should be at B13.  Better still G16.]
;W[ah]C[This is just yose - presumably you were thinking that the cut at C9 now works?  If you were just intending to deprive black of a few points on the edge, it's much too small.

You have lost sente and black is back in the game.]
(;B[pj]C[See variation.];W[pg]C[Good.  Isolate and attack the black stone at Q10.  It may well live, but in the process you should build strength around which can be used to gain profit elsewhere.]
;B[mc];W[he]C[Phew! At last.];B[jp]C[The game is now getting quite complex strategically and it would be interesting to know what you were thinking.

TIP : when submitting games for review, try to put down your reasons for choices at key points of the game.  That way the reviewer can understand whether any mistake is due to lack of strategy or of misreading the potential.  You can also put in questions for the reviewer.

There is a big battle coming on the right side and the bottom side.  I hope you noticed that both black corners are open at the 3-3 point; they can wait for the moment, as the side battle is more important, so long as you don't spoil the potential by your actions nearby.

A 3-3 invasion is worth 30 points, compared to the opponent defending it.  But you will give black very valuable outside influence. So you have to time the invasion for when the outside influence will not be too profitable for black; too early and you hand him a major side territory.  This is a common situation and you should have your eye on this all the time as the nearby situation develops.

Note that the cut at J17 or even the simple push at J15 are yours to play at the right time.]
(;W[hp]C[Good idea in principle.  As with 60, isolate and attack the black stone, using the power of your wall in the bottom right and of tengen.  Either K4 or Q10 would die (if you had already captured that ladder stone).

Unfortunately your attack peters out because you have to spend a turn to hold in the ladder stone.


So the question arises : Have you noticed that white has virtually no definite territory?  Are you just fighting for the sake of it or do you have a plan?  Where are you going to get some territory? It looks like the centre or the right side.

The bottom left is very big but black cannot seal it all off in one move.  Therefore my choice is to play N12, possibly preceded by J15 if I think black is going to answer it.  See variation.]
;B[jn];W[ln]C[This was your third play that was stopping O4 from getting away. If you had taken it off before, you could have skipped out at H6 happily and black would be on the run.]
;B[hm];W[gm];B[gn]
(;W[jq]C[Good.  If black blocks to the left, you steal some territory at the bottom and the corner is still open.  It's a difficult fight and hard to predict the outcome.

The right side is still massive, so I would be aiming to get a useful reduction on the bottom in sente then attack with O13/N12. It's worth a lot to play here before black.

A simpler approach would be to make the 3-3 invasion at C3, which ends in sente for you, gives black some side territory (undermined on both sides by O2 and A12, then play on the right side.  See variation.]
;B[kq];W[fo]C[What's the purpose of this?  Black has several cutting points here and you have just forced him  to mend one of them.

Don't peep without a good reason.

A peep can have the purpose of
a) destroying eye shape.  Not applicable here.  Or
b) providing an extra stone to make your neighbouring position less thin.  In which case, you would have made the peep with the intention of following it up with a stone at maybe E4, or E3, D5.]
;B[fn];W[kl]TR[fo][hp][jq][pl][mh][ie]C[Loss of focus here, I'm not quite sure what you were afraid of. There is much to play for on the bottom left.  Not to mention attacking the black Q10 stone at one of the marked points.

Your 3 stones on the bottom haven't achieved anything and if black plays D3 he secures both the corner and the bottom side.]
;B[ik]C[Now black mounts an attack on your G9 group.];W[fi]
;B[hh];W[hi];B[hf]
(;W[if]C[You could just connect at say J11, or more aggressively at J12. Your group is now safe and black still has cutting points.  Don't get too excited over capturing the 3 stones at F13 unless you see them as a threat to the upper group.]
;B[ii];W[ij];B[ig];W[gf];B[jf];W[ie];B[hg]
(;W[je]C[Skating on thin ice here.  If you read the semeai all the way to the ko, congratulations.  Otherwise consider....If black cuts at H10 and kills your group, you lose the game.  But if you win the fight you don't gain much because the black F12 stones were already weak and not worth much.   So it's not worth it.

A safer approach would have been to connect at H10, or better play K11 first, then when black runs out split between his group and Q10.  Perhaps you didn't see the danger.]

Let's just look at whether white can afford to ignore the ko threat...]
(;W[ff];B[nn]
(;W[pm]C[This looks like a natural response, but black's next move is tesuji and the Q10 stone is at just the right place to prevent your escape.

Better to dodge and give a little away rather than throw good stones after bad.  Variation shows one option.]

;B[rk];W[rg];B[qg];W[qh]C[In addition to the comments earlier, I feel that both players have a tendency to become fixated on a particular fight and play it out to the finish, regardless of the consequences.

Learn to choose your fights carefully

1 be aggressive when you have supporting strength nearby
2 be cautious when the opponent is strong nearby
3 if a fight is going badly, stop tto re-evaluate and look for ways to limit your loss by conceding some less important stones
4 if you are ahead, do not start big fights with an unclear outcome.
