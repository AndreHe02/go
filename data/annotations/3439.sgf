C[T: I was white in this game and eventually won because of some slack moves and a final blunder by my opponent. However I have the feeling that I made many wrong choices regarding value of moves and direction of play. Any advise is welcome. Thanks.

I make some comments that I hope you find helpful. For the most part, I think you played well against black's unusual opening. You might be faulted for giving black a big moyo in the center, but you end up reducing it fairly effectively. I think that black's strategy can only work to the extent that creates a great deal of confusion. In this game black is behind from the beginning.]
;B[jj];W[pp];B[jp];W[dq];B[jd];W[dd];B[hg];W[pc]C[T: Lets me take 4 corner positions and black's forces seem inefficient. I should have an easy start.

I agree. B's moves are eccentric.];B[lm];W[qe]C[T: Gives me also the corner (thanks).]
;B[cf];W[fc]C[T: I thought : let's make a strong position, I will attack later (black stones are sparse).]

LB[fb:A]C[

My joseki book says that this a cautious move and suggests A.]
;B[db];W[df]C[T: Probably wrong ? I wanted a strong group here, but it turned out bad to an inefficient cluster.

I am not sure that any of this is wrong on your part. You are frustrated because you did n't get to keep the corner, but b has the right to invade and live at the 3-3 point against a stone on the 4-4 point. You are not getting a lot out of the exchange, but that is because of b's center stones. b is going to get something for those stones just not as much as if he had played them in the corners. I think that you are still ahead on the board as a whole.]
;B[ch];W[fb];B[ca];W[cn]C[T: I thought : upper left is good enough for a while, let's take another corner.]
;B[ee];W[de];B[dg];W[jc]LB[cn:A]C[T : now I just wanted to make eyes

Yes, your group need urgent attention. If you live here, the move at A will be justified.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[jb];W[hc];B[kc];W[id];B[jc];W[ef]LB[fe:A]C[
I think A is better. Your move drives b's stone into your eyespace if he tries to escape. A makes eye potential.]
;B[fh];W[gd];B[ie];W[fe];B[qn];W[nq];B[qq]C[T: starts like upper left. I thought : this time I should have one toe in the centre and try to end the sequence sente.]

;W[nn]C[T: different, more toward the centre];B[qj]C[T : black settles, but I can make an extension (maybe the wrong one)]
;W[qh]C[
So far so good. I think you are still ahead.];B[ph];W[pg];B[oh]
;W[qi];B[pj];W[pn];B[pm];W[om];B[rl];W[hp]C[T: I am glad black gave me this]
;B[dr]
(;W[cr]LB[eq:A]C[
This move ends up tending to sacrifice the H4 stone and lets b build toward his strong center. I probably would have played it myself, but I wonder if something else would be better. How about A? (See alternate)]
;B[eq]
(;W[cq]LB[dp:A]C[
The next few moves seem slow for you. B gets a bigger center territory than you would like. A move at A is not as firm but aims at your H4 stone and pushes black into a smaller area in the center.]
;B[fo];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo]LB[dk:A]C[T : I did let H4 and took territory because the lower part was open on the other side (O3).

This move also looks very firm, but small. I wonder if A might be good]
;B[fn];W[ck]C[T : a 3d extension for me

Yes, but a low one. Notice how b holds you down while building his territory in the center.]
;B[dl];W[cm];B[cl];W[bl];B[dk];W[ko]C[T : of course black builds up some centre. I wanted to reduce (what is the right move?)

This is not bad I think.];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[km];B[jm];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[em];B[fl];W[fm];B[gm];W[el];B[fk];W[pi];B[nb];W[qm]
LB[nj:A][nd:B][kq:C][md:D]C[
This move captures 2 stones in gote. It is too early in the game for this. There are still medium scale contests for expansion of territory going on. The points A-D and similar are at the junction of b and w potential territory. B or D seems like the biggest.]

;B[fq];W[er];B[gq];W[gr];B[hq];W[ni];B[mj];W[mg]LB[lh:A]C[
I might have been tempted to extent further with A, but that might have been too bold. After this, you do a good job of the endgame play.]
