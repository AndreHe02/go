(;W[jp]C[White has several options here. K4, as they've already played. However, it is too early to Q5 or R5, it leaves white with little, and black gains more.]
;B[ed]C[White did respond to your opening, actually. [see variations\] And I think this is a good idea for you right now.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[It's not necessary to respond here right now, though. I think you should continue on in the left corner. [See variations\]]
;W[hc]
(;B[ef]C[I would go ahead and play C17. Weaken the white corner. [See variation\]]
;W[cf];B[dc];W[cc]
(;B[cb]C[I wouldn't play this move here. It doesn't really do anything to the corner and doesn't gain you much [except some gote later on\]. [See variation\]]
;W[kd]
(;B[gb]C[This move is unnecessary, I think. It's more like an endgame move to me. I would either extend out, or play elsewhere for now. It's too early in the game for this group to be dead. [See variations\]]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[qn]
(;B[rn]C[I don't think this helps you out too much here. It might seem like it prevents white from getting an eye, but there wasn't much space for an eye to begin with. It's mostly just a reducing move. [See variations\]]
;W[rm];B[ro];W[ql];B[rk];W[dj]
(;B[cq]LB[cn:A][fq:B]C[I don't really like this move. That's because after the joseki, white has basically sealed you in the corner with no room to expand, while they have gained quite a bit of influence. It's much better, in my opinion, to approach from one of the sides and then reduce the other side. [See variations\]]

Perhaps you can do some life and death to get a feel for shape, and watch stronger players' games. When you are about to make a move, try and think, "Is there a bigger move that I can play elsewhere, something that the opponont would respond to, or is better for me?" And also, when you invade, it's okay to lose a few stones. As long as you reduce the opponent in the process, I think it's okay to sacrifice.]
