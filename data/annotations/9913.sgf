C[Laniol [6k\]: Hi, enjoy
tora830 [7k\]: hi];B[pd]C[Dear Reviewer =)

I think my main question in this game is how to attack the opponents weak stones profitably. There are two places where this becomes important in this game, I believe. I commented there. However, any advice on any topic you wish to give me is very appreciated.

I hope you find the game entertaining :)

Thanks a lot in advance!

Hello, I'm Julien, 1k kgs, I'm going to review your game.

This game is a typical example of a player (you :)) being in a big lead (20+ points) during the whole game, still having more than 15pts of lead at the beginning of yose, but lose by a very few points: you should definitively improve your yose... Indeed you played several passing moves, or even -1 gote moves. It is like playing an handicap game ;-).

My other advice is that you need to count during the game in order to know if you have to create a complicate situation (e.g. by invading) because you are losing or to simplify the game because you are winning.]

Yes, so much :-). But you begin my a mistake that your opponent did not use...]
;W[ce];B[hc]
(;W[he]C[This is a typical problem for me. How to attack a stone like H17 profitably?

Your move is ok. I think the 2 other suggested moves are ok too since H17 was the wrong direction anyway (not the largest part of the board).]
;B[jd]
(;W[lf]C[Bad move because it is easy for black to escape. In general, do not attack from your strong side but push your opponent against it.]

(;W[fc]C[Bad: it strenghtens black.];B[fb];W[dj]C[is this a good result?

yes, that is a winning position (even if I think that my variation is better : additional points in top left)]
;B[ql]C[Small: the bottom is the open side of the board.]
(;W[jg]TR[le][lf]C[might be slow...

Yes. It would be ok (honte move) if white could have cut the marked stone effectively but nothing to worry here (see variations).]
;B[cm];W[co];B[em]
(;W[ck]
(;B[bn];W[bo];B[fk];W[db]C[It would be ok if it would be sente. But it isn't since you can't kill the black group.]

(;B[gb]
(;W[ma]C[this must be slow...

A 2 points reverse sente move... This kind of moves can only be good if it is absolute double sente move.]
;B[fi]C[it seems like he put down a weak stone at C7, but I could not gain anthing from that because I did not really attack...

I don't agree: even while passing a move with N19, you gain points on the upper left (with white E12) and you consolidate the bottom left corner. Even more, black is yet not very stable with no eye and weak points for potential cuts.]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[fg];B[ej];W[ei];B[ek];W[gq]C[That is a good move.]
;B[dk];W[cj];B[cl]
(;W[ol]C[is this good?

It is usually a good point to begin with, but, considering black thickness at the top and the shimari at the bottom, I would say it is a bit too deap. Also this moyo is not that big with the very strong white M14 group. So no need to do a very sharp reduction.

More importantly, have you count? If black would be leading, it would be a good move. Since it is far from the lead, it is a bad move, taking too many risks for nothing.]

(;B[pm];W[oj];B[nh];W[mk];B[lh]LB[mm:B][nn:A][jq:C]C[I think that A, B and C are all ok. Safety is A or B. C is taking additional points if you're sure that the central group is fine (it should be).]

(;W[ih]C[looks bad, or?

actually it seems like this is a passing move, which -- given it was B+1,5 -- might be the loosing move...

Terrible move. Why do you play here? It neither defends nor attack. It is just a passing move.]
