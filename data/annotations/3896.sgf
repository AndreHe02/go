C[Mattias> Hi, my name is Mattias and plays as 9 kyu on DragonGoServer.Net.
I was 8 kyu when the game started. So was white. In this game
it felt as I played good in the beginning but ended up loosing.
I wonder where I played wrong and what I could do better.

I played as black.];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ci]C[Mattias> I am a bit afraid of letting the opponent get three
stones or more along one side. Therefore I played C11.

RM: Yes this is a big place for white.];W[od]C[Mattias> Lately I have become found of playing P17 as in the
variation. But it feels too good for white when he got a stone
around D17.]
(;B[pf]C[Mattias> So I tried this variation.];W[qc]C[Mattias> How should I respond?

RM: S17 is the begining of several josekis.]
(;B[pd]C[RM: This is not so good - see variation.];W[pc];B[oe]
;W[nd];B[qk]C[Mattias> How bad is this?

RM: Black is a little over-concentrated at the top. White's shape
looks more efficient.];W[nq];B[no];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[iq];W[gq]
;B[lq];W[nr];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[cl]C[Mattias> My plan is to invade at C3. I hope for C6.]

(;B[aq]C[RM: Black must play B1.];W[bs];B[ao];W[ar]C[Mattias> This move surprised me. I hate ko. I'm afraid of ko.
Maybe I should seek opporunities to play ko mote often so I become
better at it...

RM: Yes, it is important to be comfortable playing ko.];B[as]
;W[qf];B[re]C[Mattias> How was this answer from black?

RM: Good];W[ar];B[ic];W[bq]C[Mattias> White did not answer my threat and I was satisfied.]
;B[lc]C[Mattias> It felt big to make a secure group. But maybe I should
try to find a larger threat? But it is hard to find... Suggestions?

RM: M17 is good.];W[br]C[Mattias> Ok, the ko-fight is over... But it feels like I gained
from this.

RM: Taking at A4 is better for white.

RM: Yes, black has ignored your erasure threat and then had to
take gote.];B[nb]C[Mattias> I follow up with a threat for P17.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[oc];B[me];W[rc];B[em];W[qe];B[qg];W[rd];B[pg]
;W[pe];B[ne];W[jp];B[jq]C[Mattias> This move felt a bit submissive. Can I play more offensive?

RM: White is strong on both sides, and you have weak points at
N4 and P4, so you should defend at K3.];W[ip];B[kp];W[hp];B[kn]
C[Mattias> Up to here I feel very satisfied with my result of the
board. I felt as I was going to win.];W[pj]C[Mattias> Opps...]
;B[pk]C[Mattias> Is this correct?];W[ok];B[oj]C[Mattias> I try to fight. Though fighting is my weak spot.]
;W[ol];B[qn];W[nj];B[oi];W[mk]
(;B[ei]C[Mattias> I still believe I am ahead. I secure more territory.

RM: White has three LARGE corners, the game is close.

RM: This move is too small. White has a floating group in the
centre. It would be normal to threaten this group whilst making
territory. You could remove its eye by playing N8 first. Then
the group will have to make two eyes, so you should be able to
good advantage of it.

RM: If black wants to avoid a complicated fight. perhaps a similar
but larger move. Somewhere around G14 is reasonable. If white
dares to try to erase the left hand side, the floating group
will get into trouble.];W[qm]C[Mattias> hmm...];B[pm]C[Mattias> Correct?

RM: Yes ok.];W[pl];B[ql];W[rm];B[rn];W[om];B[pn];W[mm]C[Mattias> Here I am afraid to be cut of. Maybe N5?]

(;B[mn]C[Mattias> So I played there...];W[ni];B[oh];W[ge];B[ie]
;W[hb];B[ib];W[hc];B[hd];W[gd]
(;B[gg]C[RM: So now E11 looks like a wasted move. G13 is too small with
E11 where it is.

RM: Black's group on the left is undermined by B6. B7 is sente
and saves the area. See variation..];W[kj];B[ij];W[hm];B[gl]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[hk];B[hl]C[Mattias> Maybe a misstake...

RM: Yes, G9 is simple and fair.];W[ik];B[il]C[RM: Again G9 would be better.]
;W[gj]
(;B[jl]C[RM: Again G9 is still possible.

RM: Cutting at K9 looks possible, but the fighting is rather
complicated. See variations...];W[jk];B[lm];W[ml];B[mh];W[ej]

;B[kf];W[lf]C[Mattias> Oh... bad... again...];B[jf];W[mg];B[ho]
;W[ak]C[Mattias> I saw this move early. But I read it out that I could
capture that stone. I read it wrong. Maybe I should stop this
earlier?

RM: The infamous "Monkey Jump". Normaly worth about 8 points
in sente! So black should have played B7 earlier.];B[al];W[bl]
;B[bk];W[am];B[aj]C[RM: If you don't like ko don't play here! B10 is safer.]

(;W[al];B[bj];W[rg];B[rh];W[rf];B[rq];W[rr];B[sp];W[sr];B[be]
C[RM: Black should play B14 (threatening a Monkey Jump) and keep
sente here.

RM: Don't forget, a 1 point sente move is normaly worth more
than a 10 point gote move.];W[bd];B[af];W[sh];B[ri];W[si];B[sj]

more interesting.])
(;B[rb];W[lc];B[qj]C[RM: This is not a strong as the S15, and black must watch out
for R15 later in the game (it does not work yet but it can be
dangerous later).])))

C[RM: The variation you entered here is not that good for white.
Note that J17 and D17 are both low, so this is not very efficient.
Black has taken a large corner and has sente.]))
