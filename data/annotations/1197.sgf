C[My name is David (iww in this game).  At the time, my rating
was 20k and my opponent was 18k.  I have been playing go for
about four months now and desparately want to improve.  I have
included comments on my moves below (where I think I played well,
why, and where I think I made mistakes).  Any additional comments
would be greatly appreciated.  Especially a summary of the things
I should work on improving.  Thank you very much!!

RM: A few general points.

Avoid making complicated battles if a simple move gives a definate
advantage (eg move 13 or 35).

Use your attacking strength to build terratory whilst attacking
(not killing) your opponent. eg move 43.

The endgame is important, making 5 sente moves worth 3 points
each is 15 points - equivalent to an impressive area! A sente
1 point move is normaly worth more than 5 points in gote.];B[pp]
;W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[iq]C[I used to play the high opening of j4, but I have found that
the low opening helps me more when the moyo gets invaded.  I
guess this is personal preference and consideration of opponent's
opening.];W[pj];B[cj]C[I know that k17 is often a response to q10 to prevent a double
wing, but I figured that since I already had j3 in place, c10
would offset the advantage of white playing k16 or k17.

RM: Right.];W[nq];B[lq]C[this was a tough choice for me.  i wasn't sure if i should pinch
here, or play o4.   I have played o4 before, but since q10 was
there, w could also damage any advantage from the joseki of o4.
the pinch obviously emphasized the left side of my moyo and i
figured i could equalize things with an attack on d16 later.

RM: I think P3,o4,r6,l3 would be a common progression. This would
leave black ready to pincer white's center right stone later.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[I played q3 because it would split the two stones and o3 is now
very weak.  in fact, at the end of the game, i claimed the territory
to the left of the q3-q4 wall.  i think this was good thinking
on my part.

RM: Pushing your opponent towards your strength is a good tactic.]
;W[qp]
(;B[qo]C[RM: q5 would be stronger and would help to attack o3 without
an obvious weakness...];W[ro];B[qn];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq]
;W[po]C[i have not encountered this before, so it was good learning.
i guess it would have been better to continue extending at q5
since the ladder favors white.  the way i played actually gave
white more points than if i had simply continued with q5];B[oo]
C[i knew the ladder wouldn't work, but i wanted to prevent losing
the now in danger p3 group

RM: Note that, even without p5, p3 is not so weak. It can connect
out under o3. It can attack the white stone whilst escaping at
o4. Black s6 looks interesting instead of p21. Note that j3 in
conjunction with m3 gives black the stability to be aggressive.
p5 is a steady move however - I am generally too agressive :-)]
;W[pn];B[on];W[pm];B[rn]C[i did this for two reasons.  1) it is a forcing move that threatens
lower white group.  2) it increase liberties and i might be able
to capture q6 group later.];W[rp];B[nl]C[this move was to build moyo]
;W[cl]LB[ch:b][ep:a]C[this move suprised me and i wasn't sure how to respond.  one
thought would be to simply extend at a, but i was worried about
b response.  as i saw it at the time, this would build white,
while attacking me, even though c8 is weak.  in the end, i think
i played badly here.];B[dm]C[RM: No need to play so close, this normaly forces the opponent
to gain strength. White's stone did not have enough space for
life at the left side. Black's c10 has plenty of room. e4 guarantees
a large area for black. As white tries to save c8 black can surely
build strength/influence whilst chasing.];W[ep];B[eq];W[fq]
;B[dq];W[fn]
(;B[eo]LB[dp:b][do:a]C[i attached here becuase i had the strength and wanted to build
the left side while attacking weak white group.  it seems a would
have been a good response for white, but i would respond b and
aim for taking lower side.  i figured i could still link d7 with
c10 (maybe) if white developed a strong position on top of me.

RM: D8 must be better.];W[fo]C[this was the response i expected.]
;B[en];W[bn];B[fm]LB[dk:a]C[i still wasn't too worried about the two white stone on the left,
though i think white could have developed them better if he wanted.
a would have been a nice threat at some point];W[io]C[again, i wasn't sure what to do with this.  i wanted to protect
middle territory while preventing white from making too much
eye space.  k5 seemed to be good response.];B[jo];W[im]
(;B[om]C[i played p7 to prevent white from building too strong a position
on top.  i have seen good players lose games because of openings
in their frameworks like this.];W[ql]
(;B[hn]LB[gm:b][in:a]C[at the time, this seemed like a strong response.  if white a,
i would play b.  if other, a would be good response for me.

RM: Try to build strength when attacking. Black has a nice wall
to the right. Why not turn the potential into terratory whilst
attacking white.];W[jp]C[again, i wasn't expecting this, don't know why it was played,
and didn't know how to respond.  it seemed to be aiming for capture
of either j3 or k5]
(;B[in]C[as i saw it, this was a forcing move that maintains pressure
on white.];W[ip];B[jq]C[k2 was to protect lower side];W[jn]
;B[ko];W[jl];B[kn]C[this was simply to gain more liberties for the move i was about
to play];W[jm];B[gp]C[at the time, this made perfect sense to me and worked out well
in the end (i think).  however, it may have hurt me on the rest
of the board.];W[fp];B[ho];W[co];B[do];W[dp]C[i had played f7 earlier to stop white and to deal with this situation.]
;B[bp];W[gm];B[gn];W[fl];B[dl]C[this was a huge mistake.  i was trying to capture the f4 group,
or at least shut it off from other white stones, but my stones
are now also weak.  i was worried that if i simply responded
e7, white would play e8 and capture this group.  i checked it
out later, and i was right.  e7 response would kill this group.]
;W[em];B[dn]

(;W[dk]C[i am still in trouble, but now i have more liberties.]
;B[ck]C[the ladder works for me and lets me out.

RM: Relying on ladders is sometimes problematic. Your opponent
can always tenuki (play elsewhere) and place a ladder breaker at
a later time which can be very expensive. You can be sure that
the ladder breaker will be worth quite a few points. They give
your opponent a lot of choices for their "free" move.

RM: I this case the ladder does not work ...];W[cm]C[RM: An error by white. e8 kills blacks group.]
;B[ek];W[jd]C[this was a huge problem for me.  k16 breaks the ladder, but also
builds white's moyo.  a great situation for white.  i had to
respond to save my group.];B[dj];W[qg]C[the force at d10 allowed white to build more strength.  however,
if i let white kill the d6 group to take some of these other
points, then white gains a lot of territory AND center influence.
This was great playing on white's part and helped him win.  I'm
not sure that i could have avoided this.

RM: Yes black has fallen behind.  White's group in the lower
center is not absolutely alive yet. Black may be able to threaten
it a little in order to reduce white's upper moyo...]
(;B[rl]C[s8 looks odd in response to big white moyo, but i wanted the
threat for later and i knew it was a forcing move.

RM: This forces white to get stronger. Generaly using a forcing
move without reason is bad. Save the "aji" (potential) in your
"dead" stones. At the very least you have lost a ko threat. That
ko threat might be worth 30 points later!

Threatening whilst takes eye potential at e8 better I think...]
;W[qk];B[fd]LB[fc:b][cf:a]C[i debated a long time between this move and a.  a would help
me build left side strength, but with k16 in place and right
side mostly whites, i wanted to break up his moyo.  this seemed
better than b because of k16.  however, i know i messed this
up.];W[dg]LB[dc:c][fg:b][ic:a]C[this was a very strong response, i think, from white.  i debated
between a, b, and c.  in the end,];B[cc]LB[cd:a]C[i chose this because i was hoping white would let me live by
playing a.  of course, his response was much better.];W[dc]
C[this also contributed significantly to my loss.];B[cd];W[ce]
;B[be];W[cf];B[bf];W[bg];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[fc]LB[ei:a]C[i thought about trying to get the f16 stone out, and i probably
should have, but white could cut me off with a and i would have
a tough time trying to live.  in the process, white would build
incredible strength on right side.  given my c17 mistake, i "think"
i made the right choice to leave the f16 stone]
(;B[ad]C[RM: Let see what happens if black tenukis ...];W[jg]
C[this hurt in a big way.  was a16 necessary at that point?

RM: I don't think so];B[nd]C[this was the only place that made sense to me to invade.  maybe
you can suggest something better?

RM: This looks like a reasonable place to big some hard fighting.]
;W[oc];B[jc]C[this ended up being a mistake, but i hoped that i could build
upper territory because of linking with either side.  however,
i think white was just too strong in this area.  suggestions?]
;W[id];B[ic];W[gc]C[nice response by white];B[kd];W[lb]LB[lc:a]
C[this was also a nice play.  i didn't know how to deal with it.
i probably should have played a.
 RM: Yes m17 correct.];B[mb]LB[mc:a]C[i was expecting a as response.  this was just a bad move i think.]
;W[lc];B[ld];W[mc]
(;B[nc]C[RM: I think giving up o16 and attacking k15 whilst moving into
the center is better ...];W[nb];B[ob];W[ma];B[od];W[pc];B[pf]
C[i played q14 to try to begin building eye space.  it probably
wasn't the best move.];W[pe];B[of];W[md];B[me];W[ne];B[oe];W[le]
;B[nf];W[ke]C[this was another very nice sequence by white.]
;B[lf];W[kf];B[qf]C[i figured that i had at least one eye at this point, so i would
use the strength to take away some territory before white played
r14.  i was expecting r14 response to q14.  it seems it would
have been better for white to take profit in corner and side
instead of the way he played.];W[qe];B[qh]LB[ph:b][oh:a]C[this was another mistake that seemed good at the time. a or b
probably would have been better.];W[rg];B[rf];W[ph];B[pg];W[rh]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[ni];W[mg];B[mf];W[lg]
(;B[ng]C[this pretty much secured my second eye, but white now has a lot
of strength on left side of the board.  i still have opening
at s15.  i was thinking that f13 might be a good play soon for
me, but f12 response would have been strong.  i think i simply
worked myself into a bad situation.

RM: Bad timing. Must not play o13. At least make useful sente
moves first.];W[lj];B[kh]LB[li:b][kg:a]C[this seemed strong at the time because i was thinking b follow-up
move to a.  it worked out in the end for me locally, but i think
white got the upper hand when you take the whole board into consideration.
i guess that is what happens when you invade a strong position.

RM: f12 better.];W[jh];B[li];W[ji];B[kg];W[ki];B[lh];W[fh]C[this was a great play by white.]
;B[kc]C[i should not have played here.  but i didn't see a convincing
play around h10.  suggestions?

RM: Try putting yourself in white's position. Where would you
play as white? Easy, F9 or F10 is very big. So playing to stop
that is sensible. How about G10?];W[hd];B[re]C[i was hoping to save k17 group by threatening m17 group, but
i had to extend p18 first.  so, not only did this move reduce
white territory, i thought it would help me save that upper group
- which would help to offset the gains by white in the center
of the board.];W[rc]C[strong response i think.

RM: Yes it is correct.];B[rd];W[qb]C[at this point, i didn't see anything else convincing at the time,
so i moved on to another part of the board.];B[gj]C[this was the only play that i saw that was safe given the conditions
around h10];W[hm];B[hp];W[hi];B[gi];W[gh];B[pl]LB[hj:a]C[i thought about playing a, but i wasn't sure what it do for me.
i probably should have.  q8 was simply to build more on the right
side.

;W[ok];B[ol];W[oj];B[nk]C[RM: M9 better];W[er]C[i should have played f2 a long time ago.  this was strong by
white.

and if you played F2 earlier it would be gote.];B[dr];W[bi]

a convincing time to play it.];B[bj];W[hj];B[ch];W[cg];B[dh]

group.];W[eg];B[fi];W[gk];B[ei];W[hg];B[fk];W[bh];B[fr];W[gr]

N9.];W[os];B[nr]LB[ns:a]C[after looking at this again, i think a would have been safe.

the a-b-c sequence, but when white played d, that would end that
idea.  my only hope seemed to be to capture n17 group by some
stroke of luck.  i figured i would toss in one more stone to
see how white responded.  do you see a way to save this group
at this point?
