> beware of dogma, just because everyone believes something doesn't mean it's true, even if stronger players, tell you something without giving you reasons (as is usually the case with statements like "empty triangle is bad"... or else people may give you strange answers like "it has few liberties"... as if we're playing capture-go), especially in reviews, it's your job to check it out, experiment, decide for yourself if what they're saying is true (if you can't confirm this, it either means they're wrong or you don't properly understand... both good reasons to challenge them)

> punish your opponent. Early in the game you made a good move that was ignored, take advantage of it. 

> in the endgame try and seize the initiative, even if you hand it back to the other player, you end with more points.

As for the general comments you made with your review request:
> useless moves are things no go player can truely avoid until a high level.
>I've added comments where I feel moves are of interest, but the main focus are the questions you ask, only you can say if you're not asking enough questions (ie. if you're not getting enough out of the review).

Apart from that your play was nice and fun, if you've got any questions (or challenges) I'd be delighted to answer them.
