;B[jp]C[B k4 is  unusual. A shimari (corner enclosure) in top right or bottom left, or a  kakari (approach move) against a W stone would be more conventional.]
;W[qe]C[sakul: I dont know why I didnt kikari on the other stone, in  hindsight that would seem to be the bigger point

jl: yes, B d5 would give B a good position working well with k4.];B[oe]
C[jl: If B doesn't want to make a pincer, the joseki is B o16 or B  p16. B p15 leaves weaknesses in B's position.]

(;W[pg]C[W could take  the corner in sente (see variation)];B[jd]
(;W[oq]C[I  would still prefer taking the upper right corner in sente (see variation)]
;B[co];W[fc]C[W f17 gives B the superb point of D10  (double wing extensions from a shimari). This is why W p3 was probably not  good.]
;B[pl]C[B would have a simpler game with B d10, which would  also be a very good point for W.]
;W[pj]C[Again, W could first take  the top right corner in sente, then play the critical point d10.]
;B[po]C[B q8 is not in immediate danger, so B d10 would probably be  bigger than q5.]
;W[dj]C[W d10 is a very big point.];B[cl]C[B c8 is big, but B could first exchange in sente B r5 for W s4.]
;W[lc]C[W m17 takes advantage of the weaknesses left by B p15.];B[le];W
[jb]C[W could play at o17 in sente first.];B[kc]C[There's not much B territory left to defend at the top, so B  could consider a counter-invasion at d12 instead. Be willing to exchange  territories instead of being emotionally attached to your original  territories and defending them in gote.]
;W[kb];B[mc]
(;W[qn]C[An attack at r5 would be stronger. W r6 leaves weaknesses  in the W position.]
;B[pp];W[qq];B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[qm]C[B r7 is a mistake. B should sacrifice a stone at  s4 (see variation).]
;W[pn]
(;B[rn]C[B should sacrifice on  the other side (see variation)];W[rm];B
[on];W[sn];B[np]C[B still needs an extra stone to link with B q8,  so the sacrifice at s6 didn't do much.]
;W[oo]C[W p5 reinforces B. W  could play o3 directly.];B[op];W[om];B[nn]
C[Now  B has two good points, q7 and o3.];W[nq]
(;B[mp]C[B could  play at n3 (see variation).]
(;W[kq]C[W should simply play at M3  (see variation).]
(;B[pq]C[B should simply cut the L3 stone starting  with N3 (see variation).]
;W[jq];B[mq];W[pr]C[The k3 group is more important than the o3 group, so W should play g3  instead of q2.]

(;B[qr]C[Again, the k3 group is more important, so B  should take profit in sente by attacking it. See the variation for a possible  attack.]
;W[rr]C[W s2 is big but W g3 is probably bigger.];B[or]C[B should still attack at j3 in sente instead of taking a small  profit in gote.]
;W[gq]C[Necessary.];B[pm]C[Big.];W[qk]C[W r9 is not urgent. W could first take the top right corner in  sente then switch to the left side.]
;B[rn]C[B s6 is not urgent  either. B still had o8 if W connected.];W[qs]
;B[nr]C[B o2  is very bad. It is much too early to take two stones in gote. There are much  bigger points in top right and left side.]
;W[ip];B[kp]C[After W g3 and j4, the W group is safe, so k4 is no longer an important  stone. Instead, B could play m18 in sente first, then invade around d12.]
;W[ck]C[W thanks B for not playing there earlier :)];B[dl];W[fj]C[W is leading, even though there are weaknesses in the big  moyo.]
;B[hc]C[B h17 is likely to reinforce W. B could instead start  invading or reducing the W moyo. B c11 and B b16 are possible entry points.]

(;W[jc]C[W should simply play at J17 to link with the left (see  variation). This would avoid reinforcing B.]

(;W[ef]C[W  should simply play f15 (see variation).];B[nl]C[B o8 is not urgent.  The top right corner is probably bigger. If B wants to play o8, B should play  j5 sente first.]

;W[ph];B[oi];W[oh]C[A  peep at W O12 might be better. W has the support of f10 to reduce the black  center.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[of];W[ni]C[W  o11 captures a single stone in gote. This is too small and too kind for B,  forcing B to make some territory in the center. W should atari from the other  side at n12.]
;B[mh];W[nj]C[Too small and gote. If W wants  to reduce the black center at the bottom, W j5 is more effective than o10. j5  is also a shisho breaker against B o10.]
;B[mk]C[B should play j5  sente first.];W[jg]C[This invasion is too deep. W is still ahead  and so should play more conservatively.]
;B[hh];W[ji];B[hj]C[The attack against the center W stones has already  reinforced B on the left side, preparing a B invasion at c11 then e11.]
;W[li];B[lh];W[mi];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh]C[sakul: that sequence didn't go too well

jl: this is a consequence of k13 going too deep in the B center.]
(;W[jl]C[W L8 would be better. B can't cut (see variation)];B[jn]C[B k6 is gote and very small. B must not passively reply to  white's moves. B should instead invade the top left at c11.]
;W[fh]C[Good. Now B can no longer invade the top left. But W b9 might be better for  the same effect, because f12 is clearly gote, whereas B suffers some damage  after ignoring B9.]
;B[hm]C[B h7 is almost a dame (worthless point).  B L8 would be better. B s18 would also be very big. To make territory around  e5, B should start with m2 then f4, not h7.]
;W[km];B[ok]C[B is wasting ko threats.];W[oj];B[kk];W[jk];B[fp]C[B should play m2 sente first.]
;W[fq];B[eq];W[fr]C[W should play g4 sente first.];B[dk];W[fl]C[W f8 is an overplay. W must defend at c10.]
;B[cj]C[Very  big.];W[ci];B[bj];W[bi]
(;B[er]C[B  should capture at b9. The difference with the actual game is big (see  variation).]
;W[bk]C[Very big.];B[bl];W[aj];B[gp];W[hp]C[Now W has a weakness at h2. This is why W should  have played g4 before.]
;B[em];W[la];B[mb];W[fm];B[fn];W[rb]C[W s18 is very big.];B[pb];W[qn]C[W should first defend the weakness at k10 by playing j11 in  sente.]

(;B[ho]C[B h5 is very small and gote. Play sente moves such  as m2 fist. Among gote moves, m6 would be bigger than h5. Reverse-sente moves  such as a8 are also twice as big as gote moves. B can also start a nasty ko  with L8 (see variation).]
;W[ln];B[kn]C[B L6 is a dame  (worthless point) and moreover loses sente.]
;W[mm]C[W m8 would be  safer to remove the weakness at k10.];B[nm];W[lr]
C[Big.];B[gk];W[hl]C[Too fancy. W should just connect.];B[gl];W[fk];B[il]
C[B j8 is only one or two points in  gote. B a8 is 4 points in reverse sente, worth 8 points in gote. However, the  threat of k10 is now real.]
;W[mo]C[W n5 is an overplay. W must  defend the k10 weakness by playing at j9 first.]

(;B[no]C[B is too  submissive. B should aim at k10 (see variation).];W[al]

(;B[am]C[B a7 is an overplay. B can't afford to play a ko there, because W  has nothing to risk, and B has many threats. This pattern is very common, you  should know it. Here B must draw back once at b7 (see variation).]
;W[ak]C[W is much too submissive. W should start the ko by playing b7.  Even if W loses the ko, W will gain a lot more by continuing from a ko  threat.]
;B[bn];W[fe]C[Big.];B[hd];W[gg]C[W g13 is an overplay. W should still defend at j9.]
;B[ff];W[hg]C[W starts a big exchange! But the exchange would be more  profitable for B, so h13 is a mistake.]
;B[ee]
(;W[de]C[W  could carry on the big exchange by playing j12 which threatens capturing the  k12 group, but B would gain even more (see variation).]
;B[eg]C[B j13  in reverse sente is bigger than B e13.];W[dg]C[W should capture at  f15 in sente before defending.]
;B[fg]C[Instead of f13, B should  capture at d14 in sente, or play at j13 in reverse sente. What an avalanche  of mistakes! :)]
;W[ih]C[Good. However this will make the k10  weakness even more obvious...]
;B[ii];W[ig];B[gh]C[Instead B must defend the m12 group at L14.];W[mg]C
[Nice, but this  is an exchange against the k9 group.];B[df];W[cf];B[dh]
C[Good idea to start a ko, but B L8 is bigger.];W[ef];B[fi]C[B e11 would be a better ko threat.]
;W[ei];B[df];W[cg];B[eh]C[Too small. B L8 is bigger.];W[od];B[nd];W[gm]
;B[gn]C[B h6 would be  better, to leave the L8 threat intact.];W[im];B[hk]
;W[ik]C[Now W has finally removed the k10 threat.];B[io];W[hl]C[sakul: don't even bother with a comment on  this absurd move.  The sad part is I thought I had read the bottom.  Must  have been hallucinating after staring at a screen for two long.

jl: ok, no comment :)];B[hq]C[Very nice! This kills the W  group.]
(;W[iq]C[Hopeless. But the sacrifice of two stones didn't  work either (see variation).]

(;B[kr]C[Not  necessary (see variation). W was dead already.];W[hn]C[unicycle 21k  : Probably only a moral victory...]
;B[lo]C[ sakul 18k*: oh man... after 2 hrs of intense thought...  to lose like that!
 unicycle 21k : This has been a *very* tough game for me, too! :-)];W[me]
;B[mf]C[W should not have resigned at this point.  After W m13, B would be at most 5 points ahead, so the game could have been  decided in the last moves of the endgame. This shows that was leading quite a  lot before losing the bottom group. The main reason is that B lost the m12  group with little compensation. However, another reason is that B often made  very small gote moves. It is very important to keep sente as long as  possible. White's endgame was better than black's. Both sides completely  missed the k10 cut.

W should try to keep his groups connected. If you have the choice between a  reduction in sente of the opponent's territory and an invasion, the reduction  is often preferable. W created a weak group at the bottom which could have  cost him the game early if B had attacked it properly. (The same weak group  actually cost the game in the end :)

When leading, W should play conservatively, not trying deep invasions (such  as k13) which could damage the rest of the board while one weak group is  trying to escape. Play agressively only when losing.

It is polite to resign when one is losing by more than 20 points. But only  professionals can afford to resign when losing by as little as 5 points.
