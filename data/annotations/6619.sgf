C[Dear Reviewer,

For this game on KGS I had black and won by 8.5 points (white had only 0.5 komi). This game was moyo style from both players and I am hoping you can help me improve with this style of play.

Specifically, I feel my play may have been too slow in the middle game. I would also be grateful if you could give me a few hints on the running battle we had in this game. Finally, if there is any advice you can give on how I could use aji more creatively/usefully.

I preceded my comments with P: to let you know what I was thinking during the game in the hope of helping you comment on this game.

Thank you,

Philippe

R: Hello. My name is Philip, and I am 2D on KGS (PowerP). Feel free to contact me on there anytime with additional questions. I hope this review is helpful.]

[pj:a]C[P: Low Chinese opening vs Sanren Sei!

I am curious the book get strong at the opening suggest that white play A (Q10) instead of B (K4). Then black C (C10) White B (K4).

It is a very small difference but I am curious to know if you have any opinions on the best way to proceed in this opening.

In the actual game it seemed to me that black C to answer white B   was more natural than black A then giving white a chance at C.

R: This move is playable for white. White has many options for her third move. Besides the one played and Q10, white could play at (1) or (2). Both a and c are valid as a next move for black- it is a matter of personal preference.]
;B[dj];W[fc]C[P: Too soon by white without preparatory moves? If it is too soon for white, I did not punish white very well :(

R: This move is not optimal for white. I would prefer to approach at Q13.]

(;B[hc]C[P: I try to stay consistent with a moyo style of play

R: This is a mistake. Black should attach (see variation).]

(;W[fe]C[R: This is also a mistake. See variation.];B[df];W[db]
;B[cc];W[dh]C[P: I struggled to find the best way to answer this splitting move, any suggestions are most welcome.

R: This is an interesting idea for white, although it is an overplay.]
;B[eg]C[P: I try to split white myself and get my group out...

R: This is a good response.];W[ei]
(;B[ci]C[R: This move is a mistake in direction. See variation.]
;W[cg];B[cb];W[ec];B[bf]LB[cf:B][gg:A]C[R: Black still needs to jump at A. B is a better move locally, as it threatens to connect to the C11 stones.]
;W[dc];B[cd]LB[cf:A]C[R: Black should connect at A instead.]
;W[cf];B[bg];W[ce];B[de]LB[be:A]C[R: Last chance for Black to connect.]
;W[be];B[bd];W[ae]C[P: White has split black and can still run out in the center... Disapointing for black, but I am not sure what else I could do?

A running battle begins... any advice is welcome.];B[ch]LB[gg:A]
C[R: B still needs to jump out to A. The two stones you are saving are not as important.]
;W[dg];B[eh];W[di];B[ff]C[R: When you contact a weak stone, you are only helping your opponent.]
;W[ge];B[fi];W[ej];B[dk];W[fj];B[gi];W[fl];B[cm];W[ee];B[ef]
;W[gf];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[ie];W[hf];B[qn]LB[ji:A]C[P: It took me some time before deciding on tenuki, still not sure this was best, but I did not feel I had a good attacking prospects against white.

R: If you are unsure how to continue, sometimes tenuki is best. It's hard to say tenuki here is bad, but I would prefer to continue attacking at A.]
;W[id];B[ic];W[jd];B[kd];W[je];B[ke]LB[nq:B][pj:A]C[R: This move is very slow. Black should punish white for ignoring him in the lower right corner.]
;W[ql];B[qq];W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[rn];W[om];B[pr]C[R: Too slow]
;W[or];B[qr];W[nq]LB[pg:A]C[R: White should tenuki here.];B[pf]
C[P: At this stage I felt white was doing well with a huge moyo at the bottom. Was this move too slow by black? It seemed necessary to me :)

R: Some of your previous moves were too slow, but this one is a good move.]
;W[qi];B[gj]LB[bp:B][fn:A][fq:C]C[R: Again this is too slow. Look for ways to enter the white moyo at the bottom while keeping up pressure on this group. You could consider any of the marked moves.]
;W[el]C[P: Not sure why white played this move?];B[ik]C[P: first step at a mild reduction

R: Too mild : )];W[hm];B[bp]C[R: Good];W[cq];B[bq];W[cn];B[bn]
;W[co];B[bo];W[dm];B[cl];W[jl]MA[gj][ik][pr]C[P: looking back it seemed white got more out of the exchange after  the moves in the bottom left.

R: Well, black made several slow moves which helped to solidify white (marked with the X's). Without these moves in place, black would still have ways of entering the moyo. The exchange in the bottom left was fair locally.]
;B[ip]C[R: This is an overplay, and it really shouldn't live. If you are going to make a move like this, you need to do so before solidifying your opponent.]
;W[iq];B[hq];W[ir];B[pk]C[P: I did not see much useful follow up in the bottom left, so I switched elsewhere on the board.

Maybe I can use the aji of the 2 stones later, not sure how though.]
;W[qk];B[pi];W[pl];B[qh];W[pj];B[oj];W[ok];B[oh]LB[pk:a]C[P: the sacrifice at A (Q9) seemed like a good trade for black to get a moyo in the upper right. Now I believe balck has a chance to win.]
;W[nj];B[ri];W[qj];B[ni];W[oi];B[il];W[im];B[oj];W[mj];B[mi]
;W[kg];B[lj]C[R: Good. When you make moves that are this forecful, it is hard for your opponent to ignore them.]
;W[lk];B[mk];W[nk];B[kk];W[ll]
(;B[ki]C[R: See variation.];W[kl]C[P: lucky for black white elected to defend.]
;B[kf];W[jf];B[jh];W[jg]
(;B[lg]C[R: See variation. Black can kill the white group here.]
;W[kh];B[lh];W[ih];B[ii];W[ji];B[jj];W[gb];B[hb];W[rj];B[br]

C[P: Bad from black, I did not know what to do Black A (S12) was probably better. The game seems tight.

I am also disapointed I could not get much more out of the aji of the  black triangled stones, perhaps there was nothing better.

R: D1 would be the biggest move at this point.

Overall, black played a good game. The forecful play in the upper right enabled black to secure a victory. In terms of improving, I would suggest studying attack and defense, and working on maintaining sente by not playing slow moves. Otherwise, I belive black has very solid fundamentals.]

;W[en]C[P: not sure white had to play here at this stage.
