 frakt 4k*: thx];W[pd];B[qp];W[cd];B[qf]C[I would not play black 5, but it
may be OK.  Usually after a stone
is on the 4-4 point, that corner becomes less urgent as it would take
white more than one to move to enclose the corner.  Therefore a corner
enclosure around P3 or a kakari around E17 seems more urgent.  Also, a
move at L4 or
L3 would set up the Chinese fuseki. (temporarily inhibiting a move around
P3).];W[oq];B[po];W[mp];B[qj];W[iq];B[ec]C[I can find nothing wrong with any  of the moves through and
including
black 11.];W[pf]C[White 12 is clearly wrong.  White is going to turn
black's right
side moyo into territory, losing chances to invade  at R12 or around Q8.
All this for influence which seems to have no utilty.  White will end in
gote,  so black can play D15 in sente.  I would consider a pincer around
H17, or maybe N17 or O17.];B[pg];W[of];B[qe];W[qd];B[de];W[ce];B[df];W[cg]

(;B[ic]C[Black 21 should certainly extend to K17 (joseki), but L17 is
probably even better here.  White retains a weakness around O16 remaining
from white's poor choice of of joseki.  Black seems here ready to cede
white an opportunity to expand influence at the top and fix white's
weakness.];W[kc]C[White 22 may be an overplay.  Black should probably play
O17
immediately.  White may just have to play O16 here, as slow as it may
seem.]
(;B[je]C[Black 23 is just wrong.  If black is really thinking about end
game territory reduction/expansion, then L16 is the move.  But it is way
too early for this, especially when white *wants* to solidify the weakness
around O16.];W[ke];B[kf];W[le]C[D13 is probably *the* move right now for
both sides.

But F3 is clearly a big move.  G3 is probably better in this direction, as
itwould make an invasion at L3 more severe.]
(;B[fq]
(;W[cp]C[White 28 (C4)  is just plain weird.  Kind of like q14.  A quick
move perhaps, without thinking.  There doesn't seem to be any strategy
behind such a move.  C6 is the right move here.  Check out  p.230-231 of
Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki volume
3.];B[co];W[dq];B[ep];W[bp];B[bo]C[white *has* to play 34 at c2.  After
giving black the outside influence, one had darn well better live in the
corner.];W[cj];B[cr]C[white can't live...
better not to try and play elsewhere.

Therefore Black 35 is correct and white 36 is wrong.];W[dr];B[cq];W[hr]
C[H2  is pretty small even if it does threaten G1 to rescue the two
white stones.   Black will love two middle game moves elsewhere if white
plays both G1 and H2.  For example, Q3...  (20
pts!)];B[pq];W[op];B[pl];W[nn];B[cf]C[white has to play b14.  Just
because you're getting stronger doesn't mean you can't play obvious moves.
In fact, I can't imagine why white would not play
b14.];W[db];B[bf];W[eb];B[dc];W[cc];B[fc];W[be]C[B15 hurts (gote), but it  may be necessary to
live.];B[dg]C[D13 is petty.

Black needs to play a large scale move here to take advantage of
overwhleming center influence.  J5 sure seems possible.  E10 also seems
like a better attack on the left side than D13.  The C13 stone is
irrelevent.  No need to try and capture or save it.];W[og];B[ph];W[jd]C

  frakt 4k*: no prob];B[id];W[dh];B[eh];W[ei];B[fi];W[fh];B[eg];W[fj];B
[gi];W[ej]C[G10 is the *only* move for
black 65]
(;B[di]C[D11 is a bad move that just helps white fix the
shape.];W[ch];B[gj];W[jf];B[ie];W[kg]C[White 69 and 70 are good moves.
White may never have to defend the weakness at O16.  Black will now have
trouble making center territory.  All this is a result of the K15 play
(black 23).];B[if];W[jg];B[dk];W[dj];B[bb];W[bc]C[black 75 should be left  unplayed.  white 76 should be at
c18.];B[fb];W[cb]
(;B[fl]C[black 79 seems bad.  The center territory is now  gone because of
k13 and l13 (and o6).  The white group seems like it should be able to
survive.  But an attack on the white group may be black's best chance.
White can live immediately by playing b11 now, so if black were to have
played there first... (see last variation)];W[dl];B[io]C[Yeah, I think
J5 was a key point.];W[jo];B[jn];W[ko]C[H5 seems small.  J5 and K6 were
forcing moves to reduce white territory.  Now they are light, so discard
them and play bigger moves.  P12 is now important, for example.
Alternately, consider the solid connection at j6 either immediately or
after J4.]
(;B[ho];W[pr];B[qr];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pp];B[qq];W[oo]C[The  key
move now is probably p8.  White's last few moves were all petty endgame
moves.];B[jj];W[qo];B[ro];W[ql]C[I think black can play O8.  White seems to be
very aggressive here.  I am unsure why.]
(;B[qk];W[rp];B[rn];W[ps]C[white  chooses to give up sente by playing q1, a
bad move.  Black returns the favor at R1, a worse move.

K18 is very big for example.  I think black can play it in sente now.  It
will soon be sente for both sides.  H2/H1 is also big.  S16 is also double
sente.  Black should play s16 now.]
(;B[qs];W[or]C[always take a ko once.   black 105 should be at
q5.];B[rq];W[ol];B[pk];W[gk];B[fk]C[G9 seems odd.  Giving black a stone
and forcing black to play f9, a move black clearly wants to
play.];W[hg]C[Same goes for h13.  I am unsure what has overcome white.
Why not just play J13 here? (assuming nobody sees
s16.)];B[ig];W[gh]C[J11 would seem to put paste to white's
overzealousness.]
(;B[hi];W[ih]C[J14 seems to be a good move, indicating H11  was bad.  K12
just might work here, though...
(it does, so one remains mystified about H13, G12, etc.)  White didn't
have to read all this to know not to play moves like that deep inside
black's territory.  It's just common sense.]
(;B[ii];W[ji];B[hh];W[jh]
(;B[hk]C[H9 bad.  Don't capture on a small scale.  Just play black 119 at
J10.];W[ij];B[hj];W[ik];B[hl];W[il]C[K9 seems wrong, especailly in
retrospect.  Black should play away from white's strength, where black is
outnumbered. Or play lightly, like at K8.]
