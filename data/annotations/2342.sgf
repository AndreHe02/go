;B[pd]C[Any tips on invading you can give me would be most helpful. MY defense has some holes, but invading is where I always fall short.

Hi there, this is Nate (yip, 6k* IGS).  I'll try to point out a few possible mistakes and provide some tips through the game.]
;W[dc];B[qp];W[cp];B[pj]C[This seems unusual - a play around P3 or one of the White enclosures is more typical.  The R4 stone doesn't seem to work well later on with Q10.]
;W[nc]
(;B[qf]C[This is a bit defensive and doesn't work too well with Q10.    Look at the variations for some other possibilities.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[kd]C[This is a bit loose (the proper play would be K17).  If you get a bit of thickness, there should be an opportunity to invade the top and take advantage of the thin shape.

Taking a look at the board right now, notice that Black's stones are getting somewhat concentrated on the right side.  White's are distributed a bit more, so Black should probably do something to expand his potential framework.    Attacking the upper left enclosure is probably bad, since 1) it doesn't work well with the existing black stones, and 2) will assist White in solidifying the top.

Enclosing the bottom right will net about 10-12 points or so, but would likely give the initiative to White, whose territory can probably expand more easily than Black's right now.

Taking all that into account, making a kakari around E4 is probably best, though a play at K4 may work as well (White would likely play around D10).]
;B[ep]C[Good!]
(;W[dm]C[This doesn't seem like a good response.  Black should try to take advantage.]

(;B[dn]C[This leads to a terrible result for Black.];W[cn]C[Black has no good response to this...]
;B[do];W[co];B[dp];W[cq];B[ip]C[White has secured a large corner here, while Black's group is floating without eye-shape.  The territory is wide open along the bottom, which means that it will take more moves to secure it.   Black can't even claim influence from this exchange, because of the D7 stone.  The stone at E4 looks very out of place now - especially considering it was exchanged for D7 originally!]
;W[op]C[White is probably looking towards the black group in the bottom left with this play.]

(;B[po]C[I would tend to prefer a pincer here...];W[lq];B[kq]
;W[lp];B[kp]C[Playing here makes J4 seem misplaced.  Black would be better off just letting go of L3 and moving out more quickly into the center.]

I didn't think this was a bad exchange for me. It would have been delusional to think that I could hold both edges, and I didn't really give up that much

(yip)
Black never had the bottom side, so there's nothing really gained or lost there...it'll take at least one more move to even begin thinking about territory there.

Now that White has moved out with N6 and the bottom group is basically secure, the right side is vulnerable to being reduced around Q7.

In addition, White's influence is starting to look quite menacing.  Black has to do something with the next move that breaks up the moyo.  The best shot is probably to play in a way to take aim at the White group in the upper right.

As for the exchange, it seems like White got off easy.  He played in Black's sphere of influence, and managed to get settled quickly without being sealed in.]
;B[ol]C[This defends the reduction at Q7, but it's too small!  What does Black do when White plays D16, or F7?]
;W[gq]C[(brinlong)
How should I have handled this? I haven't the faintest clue how I could've stopped it here

(yip)
This actually doesn't seem like a great choice by White. Black is being forced to connect and head towards the center, and shouldn't have much trouble getting two eyes.  The bottom wasn't really going to be territory, so it's not like that's a loss.

Just connecting should be sufficient.];B[gp];W[hq]

Heres where I'm the worst. Invading. I can recognize this is an okay point on this edge, and theres another one at like H3, but past here, I just crumble like a house of cards

(yip)
"Don't play close to thickness.":)

You want to be really far away from the lower left White group.  At this point, the best chance is probably to start a fight by invading around H17, which will probably provoke F16, and then start a big fight in the corner, hoping that either you can attack the upper right group severely, or that the fighting spills into the left side.]
;W[cf]C[Driving Blsck into White's solid position while securing territory.]
;B[bg]C[Very slow.  Black could easily be sealed in here and give the upper side to White (F13, for example).]
;W[cj]C[Too small - White is obviously going for the kill, but Black can escape without too much trouble now.  The left side isn't worth very much if Black connects to another group.]
;B[bj]C[Black needs to take advantage of the opportunit to escape.  Getting an eye along the edge in gote isn't helpful.  When invading, you don't have to live in the opponent's territory; sometimes it's best to just run away.]
;W[bk];B[bi];W[bf]
(;B[cg]C[Totally unnecessary.  Black's guaranteed an eye at either B12 or A11, and can't possibly get two.  C13 is a wasted move.]
;W[ef];B[eg]C[Strengthening White's upper side is the wrong approach - Black has to keep it as open as possible to invade later on to have any chance.]
;W[ff];B[fg];W[hc]C[White could even get away with G13 here.  Black can't invade as long as the B13 group is in danger.]
;B[gf];W[ge];B[hf];W[jj]C[White seems to be trying too hard now.  The upper side still has a little aji left, and by fixing that, there's no way for Black to recover.]
;B[mh]C[What's the purpose of this move?  White can escape in any direction, and it doesn't aid the weak Black group.  Nor does it reduce White's territory.  It may increase Black's slightly, but it's not a particularly efficient method.]
;W[nf]C[Black probably wishes that he had played at O15 instead, now.]

(;B[og];W[ni]C[White seems to be asking to be attacked.]
(;B[oi]C[Submissive.  The only way White can make use of this stone is to connect to another group; it's certainly in no position to make eyes on its own.  Attack on a large scale!]
;W[nh];B[oh]C[Again, very submissive.  What's wrong with O13?  There's no way your stones can be disconnected.]
;W[ng];B[nj];W[lj];B[kh]C[Leaning against the top is better.  Black can reduce the territory there, while slowly going to the right.  Even if White plays J14, and completely encloses the center territory that is being developed now, it's just ten points.

Black has to start a fight somewhere to have any chance, but he is very far behind.]
;W[ig];B[ih]C[Too much importance is being attached to this group.  They don't serve any purpose other than possibly disrupting a tiny territory if they escape.]

(;B[jl];W[kj];B[hl];W[ik];B[ci];W[ck]C[A few observations:

White made a lot of overplays in this game, but was never severely attacked.  He managed to keep the initiative throughout, and picked all of the battles to be fought.  There were times Black could have taken the opportunity to counter, but he never did.

Black spent several moves connecting stones and defending groups that were already safe and connected.  Don't get overly attached to territory and fiight to defend every point of it to the extent that other large points are missed.

As a result of missing those large points, Black was forced to invade to catch up.  One good way to avoid needing to invade is not to fall behind.:)

When an invasion is called for, be ready to play lightly and not create a heavy group which the opponent can easily harass.  Running isn't necessarily bad, and may be better than living small.

When an opponent invades, it may be possible to let them live, but in a confined area.  Barring that, try to make them flee so that you can make territory while chasing.]
