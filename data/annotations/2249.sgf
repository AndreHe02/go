AB[dd][dp][pd]C[Mans: I will comment both black and white play. Since this game is a big win for white it is not an ideal game to comment. After half of the game it really doesn't matter what black or white does. White has already won. Therefore I will concentrate on answering your specific questions and try to find the moves where black loses the game.

Please remember that my strength is about 10 kyu. The moves I suggest and the theories I have, would not be recognized as the best moves possible. Far from it actually. A player with strength of 5 kyu would think I am wrong in many suggestions. but on the other hand if you play like me you would at least be 10 kyu :)]
;W[qp]C[Mans: I think white should play at Q4 here. White is the stronger player and needs to develop swiftly in order to gain back the handicap.]
;B[qj];W[gq];B[fq];W[gp];B[fp]C[Is this an overplay for black?

Mans: It is not neccessary for him to play, but it is nice shape and puts pressure on white. D6 is another good move.]
;W[mp];B[jd]
(;W[fc]C[Mans: This is not recommended by me. That stone can get a lot of pressure. See variations.]
;B[ec];W[hc]LB[ic:A];B[ic]C[Mans: white is very crowded here and black is very strong on both sides. Not very good for white.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[he];B[hd];W[gd];B[id];W[fe];B[ef];W[ff]
(;B[gb]C[What about this move?

Mans: It is a tough fight to start as black, since he is not as strong. As black I would probably have done something different on the whole board ensuring even larger territory. See variations. Any move is probably bigger than trying to kill white.]

(;W[fb];B[hb];W[qc]
(;B[gc]C[I guess (Alfonso) Black should have played
against the marked stone

Mans: Yes, this is black's first real misstake. The move at G17 accomplishes nothing. Black didn't need any eye and it wasn't an eye for the white group anyway. The white group at F18 is not under larger pressure after this move.]

(;W[ca]C[I should have played near the marked stone
instead of the "monkey jump"....

Mans: This move is not very good at all. It destoys territory for black, but on the other hand it doesn't create eyes for the white group under pressure. If you wanted to extend in that direction D18 is the move, but there are better moves on the board. See variations.]

(;B[cb]C[Mans: There are several ways to defend this move for black, but I would use play like the variation.]
;W[db];B[cc];W[eg];B[dg];W[eh];B[dh];W[pc]C[Mans: Now white is capitalizing on the fact that black forgot to defend the R17 move before. It is looking bad for black in the upper right corner of the board. The former strength black had in the corner is vanished. The thickness black has in the K16 group cannot be used anymore. But there is still hope for black.]

(;B[if]LB[qd:A]C[What about playing in A instead of the marked
stone?

Mans: That is correct. Black should not have played J14. See variations. I cannot see the reason for J14. Black is already alive enough in that area and white will probably survive too, even if it is weak.]
;W[qf];B[pf];W[qe];B[pe];W[nc];B[nd];W[lc]C[Mans: Now black has lost everything in the corner. The game is over for black if he can't secure the whole left side of the board and a large portion of the center.]
;B[ld]
(;W[gg]LB[jp:A]C[Maybe this white stone colud have benn played
elsewere, in "A" for example...

Mans: Well, I guess that white group is weak, but there are stronger move to protect that group and K4 is not the strongest alternative either. See variations.]
;B[ii];W[di]C[Mans: This is a very big move for white and the continuation of this settles the game for a white win.]
;B[ci];W[dj]
(;B[ei]C[Mans: This doesn't work. See variation.];W[fi];B[ej]
C[Mans: This doesn't work. It is important to stop in time if you have made a misstake. This is a ladder, which should be learned as soon as possible.]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[gj];B[fk];W[fl];B[cj];W[dk]C[Mans: Good play for white. Now black has to start thinking on the whole board again.]

(;B[ck]C[Mans: This is too small if black wants to win. See variations.]
;W[dl]
(;B[fh]C[Mans: This move doesn't work.];W[gk];B[gh]C[Mans: Stop in time.]
;W[hh]
(;B[pi]LB[jq:B][oq:A]C[Why not A or B instead of the played
stone?

Mans: Yes, A or B is better. I am not clear of the purpose of Q11. See variations.]
;W[qm];B[mi];W[jp];B[dm]C[ Doubtful move

Mans: Yes, C7 is the move to close this off. See earlier variation.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bl];B[bk];W[fo]LB[ao:X]C[I thought about a "monkey jump" in X for
example instead of the hane

Mans: Well from now on it doesn't matter what moves you make. F5 is interesting since you might be able to close off another huge area in the lower center.]
;B[eo];W[fn];B[bm];W[oq]C[Mans: This is overplay for white, but then again it doesn't matter. Better to be safe than sorry :)]

(;B[pl]C[Mans: It is now tough for black. The only way to survive is to keep sente at each single move from now on. See variation.]
;W[pm];B[om]C[Is it safe a hane in this possition?

Mans: Not really. See variation]

but I couldn't];B[jh];W[jg];B[ig];W[ji];B[kh];W[hi];B[ki];W[jj]
C[Mans: This ends up very nice for white. Now the lower center is all yours.]

(;W[po]C[This is an overplay, isn't it?

Mans: Definitely, see variation]
(;B[qg]C[Mans: This is not the correct move here. Start with R16.]
;W[qd];B[oc];W[ob];B[od];W[lm];B[mm];W[mn];B[ml]C[Mans: This is not neccessary for black]
;W[nn];B[gr]C[I think black could have gone deeper in
white's territory.];W[hr];B[gs];W[en];B[dn];W[hs];B[fr];W[hq]

(;B[do]C[ Bad move??? We reviewed the game and
this move looke odd for both of us AFTER
the game.

Mans: this is a very odd move. It doesn't accomplish anything. See variations.]
;W[al];B[am]LB[ak:a]C[Why not blocking from the other side, "a"?

Mans: Yes the other side is better due to the weakness of the B9 group.]
;W[ak];B[aj];W[ch]C[Here I played to look for a mistake from
black. When we reviewed the game we
found "the" correct response for white...
(see variation)]
(;B[cg];W[bh];B[bg];W[ai];B[ag];W[bi]C[white made an overplay here

Mans: It is not an overplay. Without that, black A12 would have killed white.]
;B[ah];W[bj];B[ba]C[Mans: Again black seems to attack from the wrong side. E18 is a stronger start on this group.]
;W[da];B[bb]C[Mans: Black lost sente very fast here.];W[kc]
C[Mans: K18 is bigger.];B[jc];W[jb];B[ib];W[ka];B[ia];W[sl]
;B[sk];W[sm];B[rk];W[ed];B[dc];W[eb]
(;B[df]C[Mans: Not neccessary for black. See variations.];W[rg]
;B[rh]C[Mans: This does not work for black. R12 is the only answer.]
;W[qh];B[pg];W[ri];B[qi];W[sh];B[ph];W[rh]
(;B[rj]C[Mans: Black needs to stop and think about sente and gote. After white filled with S12 he has sente. White did not make any threat to black by filling S12. This means that black is free to play anywhere on the whole board. Then S10 is not the strongest move, and black is also loosing sente again by this move, since it doesn't put any pressure on white.]
;W[hf];B[fa];W[hg];B[kg];W[em];B[ga];W[ja]C[Â» Unclear position for thw white group
upper right corner

Mans: The white group is alive. See variation.]

Mans: Yes, white won big. As you can see afterwards white got to keep his lower right without invasion and all other territories that were black influence before got invaded by white.

Imagine that black had played R17 earlier and that whole section of the board would have been blacks. Then black would have won the game instead.]
