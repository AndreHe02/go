C[Dear Reviewer,

Both Black and White are interested in your observations on this game, which swung both ways as we made our individual mistakes, and was finally settled in the yose.

We have added some questions of my own to indicate areas where we could do with some assistance.  As W I think I went awry with direction of play on several occasions.

Thanks,

David (W; SqueakyRat)];B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[od];W[qo]C[[DP did this to stop B making two shimari\]]

(;W[or]C[[DP would attacking at N2 have been better for W? wasn't sure I could handle weak L6 group in centre, although I had to in the end!\]

If there was a problem with your L6 stones black would have killed them first before living inside, Life inside is usually worth less than running into the middle of the board cause in the middle of the board you arent playing moves inside your own territory]

at this point in the game... unless you can sacrafice it for a living group around R12 area then i wouldnt, game is too close to give up that much to black]

The correct time for this was when the cut first existed :) ALWAYS defend your cuts first UNLESS a bigger move is possible.]

Ya this hurt mainly because of when you played at F8 the second black moves forwards you had to draw the stones back because they would die otherwise which means you strengthened black and weakend yourself so he could attack]

A little? White still has to reply at the area around B10 now otherwise he gives up 3 stones or crawls on the second line with his B8 stones.]

C[this seems like it would be good for black given the position of his stones at the top... regularly this is a joseki on just the corner with nothing uptop.  However the joseki usually ends with a move at R12 for black here... i think because of his top stones he can probably forego that and then go to your side of the board.. all in all i think it seems that black is more stable but white is advancing faster]
