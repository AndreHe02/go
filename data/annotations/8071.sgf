C[Hi Ferushen and Kott,

First of all I would like to start off by saying that in order to make it easier for the reviewer it would have been nice if there where some questions about this game. And who I should review for.
Since there are no questions about any specific situations on the board and I have no idea for who this review is intended, I will review for both sides and it may be possible I ignore certain situations that you may have had some problems with.

I apologise for that in advance, but if in the future you add questions about certain moves, I will make sure to cover them.

Lets begin.];B[pd];W[dp];B[dc];W[pp];B[jd];W[de];B[ce];W[cf]
;B[cd];W[dg];B[fd]LB[ed:A]C[Personally, I think this isn't a very good move. It would have been better if played at A
Playing it at F16 leaves a severe weakness for white to exploit (see variation).]
(;W[ck]LB[ec:A][ef:B]C[A submissive / patient move. I personally would assault the weakness at A straight away before black fixes it. However, if black does fix his weakness it will leave him overconcentrated.

There is one move however, that allows black to strengthen his weakness a little bit while building a moyo (see variation).]
(;B[jp]LB[qn:A]C[This is a rather aimless move in my opinion. It would have been better at A.]

C[White is in a lot of trouble now. He should have fixed his weakness instead of trying to save his weak stones as they would hurt the other stones.]

C[White has lost the game. End of review.

Conclusion: Black played a fairly solid game waiting for white to make mistakes and then effectively exploit them. White should have been more aware of his weakness and play less aggressive to make sure he defends his weaknesses first before attacking the opponent. As soon as white had too many weaknesses his position completely collapsed to give black an easy victory.

The best defence is not a strong offence, its a strong defence ;-)]
