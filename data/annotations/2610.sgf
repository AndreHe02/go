C[My opening is always were I play my worst. Any help you can give on my opening would be appreciated. Also, my instructor keeps telling me I'm 'playing thin.' I have only the vaguest idea what he mean by that, but I can't see how should be placing to 'play thick'

---

Dear Brian.

Your instructor is correct (of course, he probably is stronger than me, so whatever I say is probably wrong, and whatever he says is probably correct :-).

However, I think that your biggest problem is not in playing thin, but in situational judgement, and lack of appreciation for thickness. In a couple of occasions, you are very concerned in reducing your opponent's territory, but you do so using either the wrong move, or do it prematurely. It would help a lot if you would count the score at that point.

Another problem that you have is that you show too much interest in territory, and disregard thickness. You let yourself to be pressed in the corner too easily, and while corner is good territory, it is not big enough to win the game.

So my advice to you is to learn to count the current score. Do it many times during the game, and learn to be fast in it. This should help you to understand whether you are behind or ahead, and whether growing your own area is more important than invading your opponent's area.

Another thing that you need to understand is thickness. Learn to use it, and do not be so concerned about your own territory, especially in the beginning of the game. It is much more important to have stable groups (i.e. thick), that have expansion prospects to many directions, than to gain as much territory in the opening as possible. Territory is mapped out in the middle game fighting, in the beginning it is more important to build a moyo.  Your worry about making small moves means that you overextend, which makes your groups very thin (i.e. easily cuttable).

Hope this helps!];B[qd];W[cp];B[pq];W[nd]C[I didn't see the need to respond to this, because theres still an open corner and I can move in either direction to live.

---

The thick move would be to defend.   Tenuki is a thin move.]
;B[dd];W[po];B[qo]C[I think a pincer would be a better reply here.]
;W[qn]
(;B[ro]LB[qp:A]C[This is not really a very good choice. It complicates the game for you, so you really want to play at A.]
;W[pn];B[pp];W[no];B[lq]C[I can see this was a mistake, as its too easy to split and would would only make territory along the third line. N4 looks more effective, or n3, but my teacher said o3 would have been best, but than looks small too me.

----

This is an example what your teacher says when he says you are playing thin. You are just creating problems here for yourself, since you will need to defend later on, and are risking a cut.

A thin move risks being cut. A thick move often looks small, but you are really in no hurry. It is more important in the beginning to create good, solid, live groups and then you can go and use them as a base for attack.]
;W[nq]
(;B[nr]C[This is too early, I think. This allows white to force you to gain thickness.]
;W[mq];B[mr];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[jq]TR[qd]C[White gets now a wonderful wall, and your marked stone is starting to look lonely.]
;W[pd];B[pf]C[This is the correct side, because you need to neutralize the thickness of the white stones at the bottom.]
;W[qc];B[rd]C[Again, this is a bad shape move.];W[rc];B[pe]
LB[oc:A]C[This is not a good move, because it basically forces white to fortify his own group.

Later on, once you gain strength towards the upper side, A is the weakness in this group, because it threatens to take away the eye space. See variation.]

(;W[oc];B[rf]C[You still have to defend, and you only have one eye still.]
;W[qi]C[White quite correctly attacks from his strength. This threatens the life of your group, so you have to defend.

This is also the ideal extension from white wall.];B[qh];W[pi]

(;B[rm]C[This was to keep him from gaining the entire right edge and to possibly link up the R14 group and netting some second line territory.

Â­--

No, this does not link the stones.  Nor is it urgent, as it really does not threat the white groups in any way. 

In the opening, each move you make MUST have a good follow-up.  This has none, so it's not really very dangerous to white, who can then attack your other stones.

It does not even defend your own groups. Your top right is still in problems (it does not die, but white can gain a lot by attacking it, as almost any play around it is sente.)

You gain perhaps about 10 points here in gote, which is something that you play after the middle game has finished.

See variations.];W[fc]
(;B[cf]C[In hindsight, this should've been H16, to keep to upper edge open, but I focus more on making my own territory than on reducing his in the opening game

---

This is safer.

Invading at H16 would've meant some serious trouble for black.  See variation.

You should've neutralized his thickness earlier.];W[jd]LB[hc:B]
[ld:A]C[This is very thin for white.  This shape has weaknesses at A and B.

However, you need a bit of strength before you can attack.]

(;B[eb]C[This just fortifies white.];W[fb];B[ec];W[fe]C[This exchange forces white to defend the original weakness at A.  You gain about 5 points...]

[ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[I had to play here. Giving up the whole upper edge was unacceptable. Had he played at J16 I probably would've resigned right here.

---

This is a bit late... The only weakness left is at M16.

Count the score at this point. White has 44 points worth of certain area, and black has 39 points.

So white is 5 points ahead. THAT IS NOT MUCH!

Of course, white has much more potential to get area, due to his thickness (most black groups have been confined to corners), so it is important now to reduce, and gain area for yourself, not invade.]
;W[fg]C[White decides to kill big; or, of black lives, then gain the bottom left as area as well.

The invasion takes away six-seven points at maximum.];B[hf]
;W[gh]C[Here he was yelling about me that even though I have a chance of survivng, hes just recreating his moyo. Is it like I had any other option?

---

He is correct.  His moyo is becoming stronger by the minute.]

(;B[jg]C[This probably should've been another one-jump, but it didn't look anymore likely to survive

----

This is very thin again.  Don't forget, the knight's move is easily cuttable.

"Thin" in general means stones that are very weakly linked together.]
;W[ii];B[lg];W[ng]C[This almost looks like an overplay. See the variations for some possible results, but you *probably* cannot take advantage of it, because your right-hand group is very weak and almost any play in the area is sente against it.]
