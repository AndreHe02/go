TM[2700]KM[0.5]HA[3];W[oq]L[qq][qp]C[White is aiming for the  bottom side.
   Black has two common points to play.
   (A) is the simplest, leading to profit and an easy life.
   (B) leads to complex josekis which Black should avoid.]
(;B[qp];W[qn]
(;B[op]L[po]C[It is obvious that Black doesn't know this joseki now, and
White is going to take advantage  of that and make profit.  The correct point for joseki is (A).  Mainly
because it seperates white's two stones  and aims at running into the middle if he can't live in the corner.]
;W[np];B[oo]L[pq]C[I would have choosen (A) and tried to live in the corner.
 Now White can take the corner  and Black must run.  A Running battle is in Whites favor Based on assumption
(1).  It should be assumed  that White can get all of his stones alive.  The trick is to make it not
valuable enough to do so.];W[pq];B[qo];W[qq];B[no];W[mp];B[pm]C[Black seems  very over concetrated.  And Whites bottom now
has the corner as well.   White is gaining.];W[nc];B[pf]L[qf]C[I think I would have choosen (A).   It protects the corner
and side more and not as easy for  white to invade.  It is a bit slower than what was played but profit is
profit and white needs to gain it, why  make it easy for white by giving him things to aim for later.]
;W[jd];B[jq]L[dj][ld][lc]C[This is the wrong direction of play.  It hits White where  he
is strong. (A) looks like the  biggest point to me.  Or since black is being aggressive (B), or (C). (B)
aims at a large moyo on left side,  while (C) aims at either the corner or the top side.]
;W[fp]C[White attacks  the corner loosely.  It is up to black to
choose now.  Will white get the  corner or the side?  Now it should be obvious that k3 was not very good.]
;B[jo]C[Black choose the side, but it still has no effect on White's
bottom group.  There is no  profit here for Black.  The corner is still open for White, or if Black
closes that it will be small now.];W[kp]C[White peeps forcing Black to  overconcentrate.  White is
stronger and Black was forced to  make a non productive move.];B[jp];W[ln]
C[White is creeping out into the  middle Keeping the k4 stones
from making any profit  efficiently.];B[cj]L[dj]C[Too low, (A) is better.]
;W[cn]C[White is  Aiming at a big corner or lot's of influence in the
center.];B[eo]C[Good choice here.];W[cq]C[Only choice for White I think.]
;B[dq]C[Wise move.  But see how little profit Black is getting for
his 3 stone wall?  And he's not  alive yet.  F4 can still escape to the center.]
;W[cp];B[co]L[cr]C[I  think I would have gone at (A) trying to take the corner
back.];W[bo];B[do]C[This seems very over concentrated!];W[cm];B[gn]L[em]
[cr]C[This is a very slow move and does nothing in the way of
threating white or building  profit.  Black looks intimidated at this point.  (A) is working towards a
larger moyo and destroys the  center better.  Even (B) is better because it gains profit in the corner in
sente.];W[df]L[ce]M[cj]C[White is really aiming at the side not the  corner.  (A)
seems to protect the corner and  attack the white stone.  The marked black stone should come in handy by
depriving white of eye space,  but we should assume that white will survive anyways.  (A) seems the most
profitible way to attack white  though.];B[fc]L[fd]M[df][cj]C[(A) is better here.  It prepares to  attack the marked white
stone and make it ineffecient, by  utilizing the marked black stone.  As it is it doesn't attack anything, nor
does it secure territory yet.  White  will be able to live on the side and the marked black stone make be swallowed
as well.];W[cd];B[cc];W[ce];B[ej]L[bc]C[(A) seems the best point here.   It secures the corner and
attacks the white stones by  depriving them of eye space.  Black is running away prematurely.]
;W[bc]C[Now  white is secure.];B[cb];W[em]C[White threatens the D4 group preparing to  attack the E10
stones];B[fm]L[en]C[I think I would have choosen (A).  Trying to contain  white
is not going to work.  And the  E10 stones can still run to the center, and the D4 stones will live.]
;W[fo];B[en]M[fm]L[fn]C[Now it seems that the marked stone should be at  (A).]
;W[fn];B[dm];W[el]
(;B[gm]L[dl]C[This was not good.  The ladder  didn't work and this move was
redundant, essentially  giving white a free move. (A) would have been better.  the E10 stones would
have been connected to the  D4 stones and one of the white groups would have died.]
;W[dl];B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[fr];B[fq];W[gq];B[gp];W[eq];B[go];W[hq];B[bg]
C[This move looks like  the eye stealing tesuji, but isn't.
 If Black cuts at C14 then White  can connect at D15.];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci]
;B[bi];W[cg];B[di]L[bb][bl]C[I  don't know what this stone is aiming at.  It threatens
nothing and gains no profit, nor  does is protect anything.  (A) is a better point for attacking and gaining
profit.  (B) is another choice that  is better.];W[bk]C[White attacks and gains secure profit.]
;B[bj];W[de]C[I  think this make whites group alive.  White make such a
defensive move because he is  now leading.];B[ed];W[bf]C[White is alive now and can attack Black freely.   The only
weak White stones on the  board now are K16 and O17.];B[ic]L[lc]C[I still think (A) is the best  point to attack from.  At
least (B).];W[jc]C[Now White has an ideal 3 space extension from a 2 stone
wall.  Black is  overconcetrated on the top, and the top right corner is invadable.]
;B[jb];W[id];B[hc];W[kb];B[gf]L[pc][qc]C[This attacks nothing, and secures no  territory.  If Black
can think of nothing else to do  then Closing the corner with (A) is a better idea here, or maybe (B).]
;W[fk]C[White is really attacking two groups here.];B[fj];W[gk];B[jl];W

;W[hp];B[ho]C[Another  group alive with 2 points of profit];W[pb]C[White takes more profit in sente.]
;B[qc];W[qh];B[rg]C[There is not much to say about the game from now on.  The
root cause of Black's lose is  trying to play White's game.  Black played complex moves and neglected to
look for simple moves that  did the following: (1) Attack (2) Gain Profit. (3) secure threatened stones.
 Additionally Black's stones did  not work together.  An observation I have made is: The one with the least
number of connected live  groups wins.  Try to keep your stones working together.  They are more
efficient that way.  In this game  White end up with 3 live groups, and Black will have 4 live groups.  In terms
of gaining territory, white is  more efficient.];W[qg];B[qf];W[rn];B[pn]

play (B).];W[fl];B[gm];W[dk];B[cl]C[I don't know where white will go with  this line, but it
all looks bad for him.]))

Joseki" Volume 2 of  Elementary Go Series]))
(;B[qq]M[po]L[pp][qp][qo]C[Whites usual response is at the marked spot, but (A), (B), or
(C) are more obscure joseki for  white to choose, but Black should just keep it simple.]
;W[po];B[qo]L[qn][pn]C[If White goes (A) then Black shouldn't hesitate to  cross cut at
(B) the ladder it results in is  in Blacks favor, and the fighting will be bad for White.]

amount to 45 points which is  what Black has right now, though only 15 of it is secure.]
