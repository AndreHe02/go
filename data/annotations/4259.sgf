C[Hi Damion,

I think that the biggest flaw in this game is that you allowed your opponent to push you around. Your opponent managed to get in a big kill because you dutifully did what he wanted you to do. One of the first things you learn in go is to keep your groups connected... but there is no point connecting dead stones to dead stones! When you are fighting for life you must be prepared to sacrifice stones that will not help you create eyes!

It is important to resist your opponents attacks. That does not mean that you just ignore them (although that is possible), but if your opponent peeps at a cutting point do not just play the obvious connection, look for a way to connect such that you benefit from it. There are usually multiple ways of solving a problem in go; an important part of that is to ask yourself, "what can I get out of this? How can I shift this situation more towards my advantage?"

It's interesting, I would have thought that R13 was not a good move but perhaps that just reflects my habits within the game. I would probably play B, C, or D: either play in the corner allowing a minimum of aji and tenuki since N16 is not very threatening. However, I was looking at a game commented on by a very strong player and he had no qualms about playing E even when the white stone is at O16! This suggests to me that your move, although not one I would probably play, is fine :-)]
;W[dj]C[hmmm don't like white's san ren sai but I'm ahead one move]
;B[jp];W[mp]C[I would like to know joseki for this invasion

Try not to worry too much about joseki. It is more important to take the time to read through some sequences to understand the situation. Here, white approach is not terribly threatening. Also, white is approach blacks thickness, which can be dangerous, so perhaps you can think of a way to take advantage of whites weak stone. That doesn't mean you should slam a stone on his head at N5, but consider moves that gain profit for you and pressure whites stone. Consider playing something like Q6: this helps black to secure the side and white will probably do something to strengthen that stone. Even if white manages to extract N4, black would have made some good profit along the side.

Having said all of that, I do like your move in the game. It is similar in principle; you take the opportunity to make some profit along the bottom and secure your outside stone. The important thing here is not to go to pieces and think you have to slam whites stone. Whites stone is not a threat, so look for the best way to make profit.]

(;B[qq]LB[on:C][pn:B][oo:A]TR[qn][mp]C[--

I don't like this move. You do not want to be shut in the corner and you do not want whites stones to work together. With those thoughts in mind, you should try to split these stones even at the expense of the corner. If your stones get sealed in the corner they won't be any use to you throughout the rest of the game. So I think that you should consider the moves A, B, and C. A is a nice point for white, so prevent white from getting it and at the same time you begin a splitting attack on the marked whites stones. Remember that you have far more support from your nearby stones than white does and when that is the case you should not play submissively without very good reason.]

(;B[lq]LB[nq:A]C[--

This is bad. You're forcing white to become stronger and risking the life of the stones in the corner. If you want to play in the corner, it should be at A. Here you have weaken both of your groups and made white stronger.]

(;B[jc]C[I know I overextended here...did when I played it, but thought I'd get away with it was the approach even good then?

--

The extension is actually ok... *if* you have a plan for dealing with white invasion. Playing at K16 would be one way to make the invasion less inviting for white.]
;W[hc]C[--

There are several joseki for the invasion of the 3-space jump on the 3rd line. White invariably begins by invading directly into the middle of the two black stones. Three basic joseki follow...]

--

This is fine.];B[nc]LB[oc:A][jg:C][po:B]C[--

This really doesn't help you much. It does get you a few more points in the corner, but it also helps white to settle his group. Avoid attaching to weak stones (the shoulder hit here is similar in a lot of ways to attaching directly). If you want to secure the corner and undermine whites base, play A.

You might also want to consider protecting your group in the bottom right. Black would be in big trouble if he lost those.]
;W[mc];B[qc];W[he]C[I liked this result, but am nervous for k 17

--

This is actually not a good result. White can just run down the H line making profit. Black will have to run too. But whites stones on the N line have pretty good potential for life so making black run along K is not going to hurt them too much.]

While the corner needs protecting, the Q11 group are too important to lose. Those stones keep the N14 and R11 groups apart. Do not sacrifice them lightly.]

-- 

Before we consider the attack it is probably a good idea to figure out the balance of territory. From my counting I estimate that black has about 43 points of solid territory. White has about 58 plus 5.5 from the komi. Although these numbers are rough estimates, it is pretty clear that black is behind in the balance of territory. It is interesting that the difference can be attributed in large part to playing M3. If you had played, say, O3 then you would not have felt compelled to defend the corner with S5 and you could have played something like N10 to extract your Q11 stones. That would have deprived white of a big chunk of territory.]

(;B[ig]C[I felt this would be a good running base

--

This is not a good shape because it has poor eye potential. Furthermore, white has pretty good influence to the right and left of your group so he can afford to scrimp on the safety of stone like J12. H14 would have been better in my opinion than J13.]

(;B[hb]C[--

Given the white stones on either side, black should probably play this joseki which is purely defensive. It links the two stones and creates eye potential for them. They should live. 

You might want to consider running out with your stones before playing this. Nonetheless, this demonstrates how to connect those stones in this situation.]
