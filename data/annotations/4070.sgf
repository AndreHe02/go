AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[*ryousans*: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.

Degan:  My main comment for this game.  With a five stone handicap, White will probably be significantly better at fighting than Black.  Black should avoid fighting.  Balck should use the existing hanicap stones and work to build moyo.  Let White live, but work to keep the White groups separated while keeping Black groups connected.  I do not see what your time settings were, but obviously if you ran out of time, they are too fast for you.  I don't know how much you learn if you are just throwing stones down on the board without any thought.  The end placement is fairly inconclusive, though looks advantaged, though not certain for Black.

Always take comments with some skepticism.  I am only ~15k - 12k.  Those who are ten stones stronger would make other suggestions, dan players would make different suggestions than them or I.]

;W[cf]
(;B[ch]LB[fc:A]C[Degan: Very aggressive, suggests that Black with fight and beat White.  I suggest A]
;W[ef];B[df]C[Degan: Black decides to start a fight.  But it is not clear what black wants to accomplish besides splitting the stones.  At this stage it is nearly impossible to kill a group of stones.  When attacking, decide it the top - side - or corner are more interesting, then you have a goal in mind.]

(;B[dh]LB[de:A][dh:B]C[Degan:  Black has played both on top and on side, and is unlikely to win both with any size.  Variation choses top.]

(;W[ff]LB[bh:A]C[Degan: I like A for White better.  White will not be closed off from the upper center, but can be forced to a very small left side territory.]

[qj:A][cm:D][dm:C]C[Degan: Both black and white have secured groups in the top left.  Black has strong influence on left bottom side, and toward center.  White can build influence to top center/right.  There are plenty of very big plays remaining.]

(;W[qn];B[ln];W[cn];B[cl];W[bp];B[co];W[bo]C[Sedul has run out of time.

Degan: Black can make small life in the upper left and has nice area in the lower right and center.  The upper right is unresolved.  White has life on the right, at the top and upper right as well, and a nice size territory with plenty of captures in the lower left.  If I were White and saw that Black was having time management issues, I would play in different areas on each play, forcing Black to make mistakes or waste time.]
