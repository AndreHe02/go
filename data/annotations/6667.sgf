C[Hi mafu,

i see that you already found out many things by yourself. i didn't comment them all but pointed out what seemed most important to me. If  you have any more questions you can still ask me via email.

Hope you enjoy my comments,
Trillian


Dear reviewer,
thank you very much for having a look at this game.

Please review for both sides.

We reviewed the game by ourselves a bit already and included the comments. It would be nice if you could point out wrong ways of thinking.

Thank you ^__^];B[pd];W[dc];B[cp];W[pq];B[eq];W[ck]C[mafu:
this move is cool
how should black answer?];B[ci]LB[ce:A][cf:B][cg:C][cn:D]C[mafu:
my ideas here:
white A is too far
B is the game move
C is probably bad because it leaves a weakness at A later and black runs ahead
D is probably best for white

T:
VERY difficult decision. also for me ;-). wc9 and bc11 are both very interesting!
i would prefer A or D now.];W[cf];B[ei];W[cn];B[ek]C[T:
I think the result is ok for black. both sides have a shimari but the black group looks stronger than the white one because it's directed to the center. 
but no need to worry for white. the game is still about equal.]
;W[en];B[dm]
(;W[cm];B[dn]C[T:
usually d7 is played as a checking move. you don't really want to cut now because white seperates the 3 upper stones as it happened in the game. just play elsewhere, maybe later the cut becomes a good move.]
;W[do];B[co];W[dl];B[em];W[el];B[fm];W[fl];B[fn]C[mafu:
this result seems fine as well
the 3 black stones are useless now];W[qf];B[po]
(;W[np]C[T:
i think this decision is good because it helps to weaken the black influence on the left.]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[qp];W[or]LB[qk:A][ql:B]C[T:
in this joseki, usually black has 2 possibilities. A or B. If you play A, you should answer the checking extension R11 with jumping to the center. You found out yourself in the game i think. So if you don't want to answer there, you should take B.]

(;B[qk]
(;W[qi];B[qe];W[pf];B[nd]
(;W[lc]C[mafu:
this move is sente, but black has no time to answer :(

T:
that's why you should better have chosen the smaller extension on R8. If you have to come back now, maybe o17 (instead of o16) would have been better on the upper side.]
;B[ok]
(;W[me]C[T:
with this move you weaken your righter side group. black should simply push through.]

(;B[nf]C[mafu:
this looks weird
difficult fight :x

he peeps himself ^^ usually bad. also in this situation]

good move! if black tries to save that black stone, his corner will probably collapse.]

white with strange shape]

white happy ^_^

black must answer! otherwise...]
(;B[cc]C[mafu:
is this the correct spot to invade?

T:
don't invade yet!]
(;W[dd]C[T:
even if you live in the corner the upper white side becomes too big and your 3 black stones on the left become very weak.]

this move is strong
i thought black dies ^^

T:
don't worry. the gap between the white stones is too big to kill you!]

emergency plan

T: good move!];W[nn]
(;B[mo]C[T:
well... looks too heavy and weakens your black territory on the right.]
;W[on];B[hp]LB[mq:A]C[T:
still better A]
(;W[jn];B[jl]LB[lm:A]C[T:
this is overplay. you should jump out with A or something.]

(;W[km];B[lm];W[kl]TR[jl]C[T:
now you see the triangled stone was senseless.];B[io]C[mafu:
aji keshi?
i wanted to make white more heavy
i am not sure if it is good];W[jo];B[gl]C[T:
this whole sequence looks like you cannot decide on wich side to play. i also think especially this move is not good because it weakens your 3 stones on the left.]

like this the game is still interesting. black got a lot but white can still attack the left and make a big territory on the right with q10.]

cannot read it out either ^^ difficult fight. i think black cannot play A (see var). so B will be the best move.]

this ladder-breaker will lead into a very difficult fight. i think white cannot kill the upper right corner, but if black makes any mistake he'll be dead so it's maybe too risky to play like this.]

good idea. this will lead into a complicated fighting game.]

this?
i think white takes advantage of r14 here
