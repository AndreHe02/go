DT[1995-12-03]TM[420]KM[0.5];B[pd]C[Review made by oba. When there are variations, comments are  made on the move actually played during the game (variation A). You have to go  back one step to see the variations, unless you use xgoban.]
;W[jj]C[strange

oba: k10 is playable as first move by B, but it is a dangerous strategy with  W, specially in a no-komi game.]
;B[pq];W[dj]C[bizzare

oba: indeed. Giving 3 corners to B at the next move gives B an easy game.]
;B[dc];W[pj];B[dq];W[jd];B[co]C[oba: I  would prefer B d15 because W d15 next works well with the other W stones. B  d15 would nullify the W center influence.]
;W[de];B[ce];W[cf];B[cd];W[dg]C[oba: W  d13 should be at d14. W d13 is played only when w wants to extend to c9, but  here W already has d10 in place. W d13 leaves some possibilities for B at e14  or c12.]
;B[fc];W[nc]M[fc]C[oba: This side is not very interesting for W  because of the marked stone at f17.]
;B[qf];W[gd]C[oba: W has all eggs in the same  basket, and the center never ends up as large as it looks initially. B is  ahead.]

(;B[qo]C[oba: B r5 invites a W invasion at k3. B k4 instead of  r5 is a possible alternative (see variation)]
;W[pb];B[qc]C[oba:  B could consider k3 instead, but that would give W an opportunity to get the  initiative by attacking the top right B group.]
;W[gc]M[fc]C[oba: W k3 is  much bigger than g17. W can't afford now to play a slow move like g17. This  is why the top side was not very big, given the presence of the B marked  stone at f17.]
;B[jq]C[oba: B now has a significant lead.];W[ne]C[oba: W o15 is still too slow. W must play more agressively at  this point since B is leading.]
;B[jo]C[oba: B k5 is 'the only point'.];W[pr];B[oq];W[or]C[is there a way to punish this?  Usually R3 is the point that takes the corner.

oba: B can't expect to kill everything here. B's strategy must be to let W  live very small in gote while B builds enormous thickness outside. Your  answer was a valid alternative. Other possibilities are shown in variations.  In all variations, B is happy to let W live very small.]

(;B[qr];W[nq];B[np];W[qq];B[rq];W[op];B[pp];W[mp]
(;B[no]C[oba: B could also consider the variation  starting at B o2, but the simple answer at o5 is actually better.]
;W[mr]
(;B[ql]M[qf][qo]C[oba: B r8 is B's first big mistake. B should not let W  off the hook so easily (see variation starting at B m3 instead of r8). In any  case, B d8 is larger than B r8: because of the two marked stones at r5 and  r14, W can't do much on the right side.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[mn];B[nm];W[dr];B[er]C[oba: B can still  play e3 here. W lives small in gote, then B has multiple targets to attack,  starting with B m3 and B o10.]
;W[eq];B[cr];W[dp];B[cq];W[fr];B[ds];W[fp]C[oba: W f4 gives a heavy shape after the B peep at g3,  so W should play more lightly, starting for example with a peep at j4.]
;B[gq];W[fq];B[gr];W[fs]C[oba: W f1 is an overplay.]
(;B[go]C[oba: B could reinforce first by attacking the other weak group  at m3 (see variation).]

oba: yes, B g9 is sente. A possible continuation is given in the variation.]

(;B[nj]C[oba: B o10 is good, but B should peep at m3 first to launch a  double attack.]
;W[pg];B[qg];W[qh]C[oba: W r12 is an  overplay. It should be at q12.];B
[of];W[pf];B[pe]
(;W[oe]C[oba: W doesn't have time to cut here. W must play p12 instead.]
;B[ph]C[oba: B correctly takes advantage of the W overplays.];W[og];B[oh]
;W[ng];B[qi]C[oba: the two W stones are  already captured, so B r11 could be at o12.]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[mi]
(;B[ee]C[oba: B should take advantage of the weakness of the W  bottom group to get easy profit in sente. A possible sequence is given in the  variation starting at m3.]
;W[rh];B[ri];W[qb];B[rb];W[mj];B[nk];W[mk];B[ml];W[ll];B[lq]C[oba: finally!]

(;W[mm]C[oba: W must connect at b3 instead.];B[mq]C[oba: B n3 is correct here.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[oi];B[pi];W[ok];B[ml];W[bq]
(;B[nl]M[ni][nj][nk][ml]C[I hate to give  up that group, but It seemed necessary.

oba: no, you should have fought the ko. The 4 marked stones are quite small  compared to the corner and left side. See the variation for a possible  continuation of the ko fight.

You get some compensation though because of the potential cut at m7, but the  problem is that you don't have time to cut now because the left side is  bigger.]
;W[bo];B[bn]C[oba: now B discovers  that there's no time for the cut at m7 because there is a risk of losing the  whole left side...]

cricket 16k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[bk];W[dk];B[am];W[cl];B[cm];W[an]
C[oba: now B is struggling for a ko much bigger than the original ko at o8.  This shows that B couldn't afford to connect at o8 so early in the ko fight.]
;B[ao];W[rg];B[rf];W[an]
(;B[lk]M[mm][mn][mo][mp]C[oba: this threat is not as big as it looks. The W marked stones can be  captured by B anyway even without B m9. See variation.]
;W[ao]M[ni][nj][nk][ml]C[I lose another group to ko.  It seems I am getting good  compensation tho.  I give up 10 points or so in LR for the 12+ points in  cutting the LR grp off.  And now I give up 25 points or so for 20 or so  points (hard to count) for capturing the white row.

oba: I assume you mean "give up 10 points in LL" not "LR". But your corner  group was worth much more than 10 points, and you forgot that when losing a  ko, you get two moves in a row elsewhere. W had given you cash (the cut at  n3) in exchange for an hypothetical gain (the ko at o8), so you had gained  already in this exchange, even if you lose the ko. By losing the o8 ko, you  get an *extra* compensation elsewhere, not just the cut at n3. This  compensation can well be larger than the 4 marked stones if W finishes the ko  too early.

Now you give up 25 points for capturing the W row that you could capture  anyway without your ko threat at m9. Thanks to m9 you will indeed make more  profit here, but the extra gain is not worth 25 points. You also had b2 as a  ko threat, and B f15 was very big.]
;B[kl];W[ef];B[kk]C[just to be sure

oba: it's good to play safe when leading, but here it's not clear that you  are leading that much, after the loss of the whole left side. B f15 would be  bigger, since it is sente.]

B played well except in the ko fights. B also needs improving in the endgame:  try to keep sente before playing small gote moves.]
