Depends what you are trying to achieve.

Ususally, you would not attach to a stone
you want to attack.

Here, I don't see the purpose.

You are not going to achieve anything by
cutting, and there is little territory
involved ...

I would rather try to invade W bottom
left ...];W[gh];B[fh];W[gg];B[hf];W[hh];B[mj];W[ff];B[ie];W[fi]

Apart from the end mistake by W (and the
fact that B spotted it), I can see that
the game was quite balanced. W would have
won by very little, and possibly lost if you had not made the two small mistakes you spotted



I suggest you improve you game by not
playing very low on the side, just to
pretend securing some territory

Then, try to understand when not to
"overplay" in your own thickness instead
of getting to the good points in the
centre.

Hope this helps.];B[eo]CR[eo])
