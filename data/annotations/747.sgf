AB[pd][dp][dd][pp][jj];W[np];B[pn];W[pq]C[You this isn't so good.  It is only worth about 2 points.]

(;B[op]C[This move pushes against a knights move.  You usually shouldn't do
this unless you intend to try to cut the connection.  If you don't
cut, you just make your opponent stronger without any gain. See the
variation for a better sequence. Whenever your opponent touches your
stone like this, the first move you should consider is a hane.]
;W[oq]
(;B[qp]C[Hane at the head of two stones.  This move is too passive.]
;W[fq];B[fo]C[While there are joseki sequences that start like this, it is usually
better just reply with a 1 point jump.  This move has a weakness
around C/D 6.  It would work better if you had already had a stone
around D10.];W[cn]
(;B[co]C[It would be better to not touch a weak stone.  Again, this just
makes it stronger.  After C3, white has two weak groups to worry
about. After touching the stone, it is better to let the lower side go, and
attack the weak stone.];W[dq]C[Since White ignored the contact play, you should continue taking
away it's liberties, The D3 group looks hard to kill.]
(;B[cq];W[ep];B[eo];W[dn];B[do];W[dj]C[Now that you have thickness around C4, you should use it to attack
the D6 group.]
(;B[no];W[mp]
(;B[fp]C[This is premature. If you can't kill the group, then you will have lost the corner.]
;W[eq];B[gq];W[cr]
(;B[bq]C[Too passive. The double hane works better.];W[gr];B[hq]
;W[br];B[hr];W[fr]C[This is a pretty good result for black. the corner is enclosed and will not be important in the rest of the game.  any potential that white had on the lower side is erased, and it is still blacks move.]

(;B[ds]C[Even if you could kill this group, it would be better to play elsewhere. I would still suggest C12 as an attack on the C6 group.  If white ignores C12 and makes the D3 group alive, you get two moves in a row elsewhere, which is almost certainly bigger than killing the group.
Killing the corner is worth about 24 points.  If you get two 12 point moves elsewhere, you do just as well, and there are probably moves that are bigger than 12 points right now.]
;W[ar];B[gs];W[es];B[hs];W[cs];B[nq];W[nr];B[qq];W[bo];B[lr]
;W[mr]
(;B[pj]C[This looks like it is too close to the Q4 wall to me.  If you want
to take a star point, K16 is probably better, or if you want to play
on the right side, then Q14 When you have a strong wall, you want to
play far away from it and force your opponent to play close to it.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[ne];W[nj]C[This looks like an overplay to me.]

(;B[oh];W[pk];B[oj];W[ok];B[nk]C[Good! Separate two weak groups, while you are strong everywhere.]
;W[qj]
(;B[ph];W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[mk];W[mo];B[lq];W[mq];B[nn];W[mn]
C[When the opponent has this many weaknesses (N7,R9) you should cut. You are strong everywhere, while neither P3 or Q9 are alive yet.]

(;B[ql]C[Never peep when you can cut.  White has to play R9 anyway, and you just forced him to play there.]
;W[qk];B[qi];W[lm]
(;B[mi]C[This is small.  The two stones at N9 aren't really doing anything anymore, so you don't care if white can capture them or not. Take a big point somewhere.]
;W[kd]
(;B[md]C[Again, pushing against this connection just helps white.
Better to stop whites extension on the upper side.];W[mc];B[ld]
;W[kc];B[cf];W[kf]C[This move is small and doesn't really threaten anything. You should take a big point.]

(;B[kh];W[fc]
(;B[ec]C[Touching this stone just makes white stronger. If you just block at D17 white still neeeds another move in this area, while your shape is complete, so you get sente.]
;W[fd];B[cc]C[If you think you need to play here, it would have been better to play D17 for you last move. This way, you used two moves to secure the corner, rather than one, While white probably needs to play F16 anyway.]
;W[jq]
(;B[jr];W[jp]
(;B[lp]C[How many points is this worth?  Not much unless yo can kill the K3 group, which looks difficult.  R17 and B11 are both really big moves right now because they are on the territorial boundaries,   They both make you bigger while making white smaller.]

(;B[fh]C[This point is small. The best you can do with it is separate two strong groups, which doesn't do you much good. Better to take R17 or some other big point.]
