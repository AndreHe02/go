;W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[fd];W[cn];B[cl]C[Black C8 is clearly a bad move :  1) D10 is already a pincer, C8 is redundant.
2) corner is more important, F4 is good enough];W[en];B[fp]
;W[fj]C[Now, by tewari, C8 becomes very bad : let's suppose C8 and E6 not played. after whiteplayed the boshi move at F10, black correct or natural move is to fly in the center with E8 or D7, but surely not exchanging C8 for E6.]
;B[ei];W[gf];B[ch]C[C12 is very bad :  against a boshi, black has to move to the center and separate white, and not trying to live . Black C12 should be  at F11.]

A11  :  better to add a move to renforce black position, and force white to spend a move to live. blanck is trying to hard.
Better at E9 or G12.];W[dk];B[gh];W[gg]

 The situation gets complicated. Now the C8's group becomes big and cannot be sacrificed.

;W[ij];B[if];W[gd];B[eb];W[go]C[White's plan is to capture the F7'sgroup. Black should H7. the corner can offer strong resistance : C3 and H3 are miai (equivalent).]

But in high handicap game, endgame always favours white.
Black's mistake is in the beginning. I recommend black to study the "boshi position" to improve his strategy opening.
The fighting technique is ok.
Black has to learn how to sacrfice his dead group. Don't try to save groups which have no values (C9's group).
