AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi, I am playing with the black stones and would like to get some help, new ideas and answers to my questions? Please also point out other mistakes and wrong ways of playing. I wrote some comments into the file - please comment on them, too.

Thanks a lot!];W[nq];B[oq];W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[Better to play O4?];W[fp];B[dn]C[Kenn: The exchange so far is safe and solid, but in general the exchange of E3 for F4 is considered good for white, since it gives some thickness to abuse black with.  One thing to think about is that the diagonal attachment should be considered sente, so when white ignores it don't follow white arond, but immediately crush his stone with something like O4.  See the variation.]
;W[np];B[pn]C[Kenn:At this point, white is pretty happy, considering it is a handicap game.  With one move around K3 (which white will save for later) white will have a lot of semi-secure territory, and your corners can be squished with R8 and C8 (these are sort of key points for that shape).  One handicap stone has already been overtaken, maybe more.]
;W[ql]C[Do I need to play something to protect my corner? S6? Or shall I invade at K4?

Kenn: protecting your corner is possibly, but it isn't the best way to go.  The most important thing is to keep white weak.]

(;B[qj]C[Kenn: This is OK too, but since white is so strong at O3 I'm not sure it'll work out.  Your corner is small without another move, and even kind of weak.]
;W[ol]
(;B[qg];W[qo];B[qp]C[I tried to defend my corner - but didn't manage it? How to improve my play in the lower right corner? I think, this isn't a satisfying result, is it?

Kenn: When you play R4, you are choosing to sacrifice the Q6 stone, so youu got a bit hurt trying to save it, I think.]
;W[po]
(;B[oo];W[qn];B[op];W[qr]
(;B[no]C[I start to run away. Is it the right decision or could I live in the corner? Q2?

Kenn: That white stone is just a probe, You can capture it and almost certainly live in the corner.  White just through it in there to confuse you.Breaking into white's domain is valuable, but live in the corner first, and you'll get a chance to reduce it because of your tengen stone.]
;W[mo]
(;B[mp];W[nr]
(;B[mn];W[lo];B[pm]C[Kenn: you can't really cut these white stones off so easily, and it isn't worth playing now anyhow.  P2 is quite urgent.  So playing Q7 just makes white stronger; yuck.]
;W[pl];B[qm];W[rm];B[rn]C[A mistake - I need to play O7.];W[ro]
;B[rl];W[sn];B[rk];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[lm];W[cl];B[cn]C[Now I tried to defend my corner - bit I think that there is still a possibility to invade on 3-3.

Kenn: No way.  Invading on the 3-3 can be used for endgame reduction sometimes, but white should definitely not be able to live there.]

(;W[em];B[jc];W[cf];B[ci]C[Better to play G17? It was hard to rescue this stone - and I only succeeded because of a mistake of white.

Kenn: I definitely don't like G17.  If anything up there, play F17, but then it seems a bit overconcentrated, and white would LOVE to play C11 to make all those stones strong.  Your move is fine, and I'll see what I can say about "rescuing" it - you should have been stronger than white!]

Kenn: This result is actually pretty awful for black.  Previously weak white stones because super strong with a lot of territory and captures too.  And you took gote too.]
;W[fd];B[gh];W[bh];B[gm];W[pi]C[After this move I make a lot of moves on the third line - how to play better?]
;B[qi];W[ph]
(;B[fn]C[Kenn: These stone's aren't worth much.  You do get a little leverage against the bottom, and increase the aji of M4, but still you shouldn't play over here.]

(;B[ko]C[Kenn: You probably played this because it looks like a tesuji, but it doesn't do anything for you, it just gives white an excuse to clean up a messy spot.]
;W[lp];B[re]C[This wasn't necessary - I was afraid of white O15.

Kenn: This is much less bad than your last move.  Wasting a move to clean you *your* messy spot is way better than essentially passing while letting white clean up his/hers.]
;W[jp];B[hp]C[Too deep? Better to play on H5?

Kenn: I think this is a good way to take advantage of all the aji you have, but it would have worked a LOT better if you had played it before erasing the right side aji.]

;W[hq];B[nl];W[om];B[jd];W[ie];B[ec];W[fc];B[cd];W[cb]C[Kenn: White is really being ridiculous in your corners.  This one may be semi-legit as a way to leverage some reduction, but you could kick some butt by studying more life and death.]

C[I was able to catch his J10 group too (and because of a lot of mistakes his Q11 group) and he resigned - there are no more questions. Thanks a lot for your help!

Kenn: OK, end of comments, too.  I would say that white needs to play more solidly, and not try to trick black, and black needs to study more life and death problems to improve reading and shape knowledge.  White's success was almost entirely just profiting (not even maximally) from black's mistakes.  Black also got back in the game a couple of times by lucky oversights by white.]
