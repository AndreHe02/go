C[J: Hi, my name is Jay and I will be reviewing your game. My comments will start with "J:".]
;B[pe]C[In this game, I wanted to experiment with "unusual" openings. I'd love a comment on opening move consistency.]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq]
(;B[jq];W[dj]C[J: So far so good.]
(;B[jd]C[This move seemed somehow lackuster, in hindsight. I wanted to play something to reinforce the top and chose the 4th line in consistence with q15. is this proper sense of direction? would some sort of shimari or approach have been better?

J: Approaching F17 would have been faster, but K16 is ok. Now, white has the option of playing H17 later.

J: You make a comment later about white's D10 being an omission of D6. See variations.]
;W[po]C[J: Q15 feels too close for white. When black pincers, white is very alone.]

(;B[qm]C[J: A higher pincering is more forceful as it pushes white towards the bottom left strong black's shape, and continues the influence-base idea started by Q15.  See variation.]

(;W[qq]C[J: White can choose P6 instead to focus on the outside. See variation.]

(;B[qp]C[J: R2 is possible still. See variation.];W[pp];B[qo]
;W[oq]C[J: P3 is bad timing, should ask R6 first.];B[pr];W[or]
;B[qr];W[pn];B[qn]C[J: After Q6 R6 trade, black has no problems in his shape.]
;W[lq];B[no]C[was this one proper timing?

J: Looks fine, assuming  black's next move is Q8.];W[np];B[pm]
;W[pc]
(;B[qi]LB[nd:A][qc:B][oc:C]C[as I said, 5-4 is an unusual move for me. I dont really know a lot of joseki surrounding it, but creating a double wing especially considering my right influence seemed like the right move. were there better?

J: R11 is much too overconcentrated with the strong group on the lower left. A, B, and C are the most common responses here. I prefer A here. See variations for some common continuations.]
;W[nd]
(;B[lc]C[J: Corner R17 is still big.];W[qd];B[qe]
(;W[nf]C[J: O14 looks like an overplay. White's shape is very thin. White should strengthen at O17/O18 first. See variation.]

(;B[og]MA[pg][ph][qg][qh]C[J: P13 is too small. Maybe only 4 points. Black can try poking at white's shape with P17. See variations.]
;W[hc]C[J: Letting white take H17 is painful for black.];B[nb]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[od]
(;B[pd]C[J: Q16 push hurts the top group. P17 is better. See variation.]
;W[oc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[rd]C[J: This way, white is almost alive.]

(;W[ke]C[J: White can also play K18 first. See variation.];B[ic]
;W[hd];B[je];W[kf];B[hb];W[gb];B[ib]C[J: Having to live like this is uncomfortable.]
;W[fc]C[J: White should omit F17 for a larger move.]
(;B[dn]C[This move seems very unsatisfactory to me now. I somehow thought d6 was a weak point he omitted in joseki earlier, but it turned out I didn't know how to explloit it, if it even was one.

J: White can omit D6 when black plays K3. If black had played J3, then white would have had to finish D6. See previous variation.

J: D6 is ok as a light move with a way to run away. D6 is also possible, but focuses on trying to get a base on the left side. Yet another idea is to invade on the top left side. See variations.]
;W[do]
(;B[em]C[J: Black can also try living by descending to C6. See variation.]
;W[dl]C[J: Good shape but white.]
(;B[gm]C[J: G7 is too easy on white, should descend to C6 first to keep white split. See variation.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[cn]C[J: This is a big gain for white, white is ahead now.]
;B[cg]C[this seems like the sort of move I should have played instead of d6, but somehow I don't know if it's a viable invasion point. am I too late for invading? if not, how would a "proper" invasion play out here?

J: C13 is harder now that white's left side is stronger. The rule of thumb is "invasion is possible when there are 24 points of empty space and a passage out". So this area is definately invadable.]
;W[ce];B[bi]C[J: Diving hre is dangerous. Black should jump out first.]
;W[bj];B[ci];W[cj];B[eh];W[on]C[J: It feels good to get P6, but attacking E12 is urgent for white.]
;B[mo]C[J: That being said, making sure E12 is safe is larger.]
;W[om];B[ol];W[ko]C[J: L5 is poor shape.];B[lp];W[kp];B[kq]
;W[mq];B[mm]
(;W[nm]C[J: White's O7 takes its own liberties, should be M5 first. See variation.]
;B[nl];W[lo]
(;B[mn]C[J: black misses an oppotunity at O6. See Variation.]
;W[mp];B[ll];W[hp]C[J: White could have made the game more complicated with H3 instead.]
;B[hq];W[go];B[gq];W[in];B[hn];W[io];B[im];W[jm];B[ho];W[ip]
;B[il]C[i still thought I might somehow be able to kill the bottom white group. I probably should have reinforced my weak group more thoroughly.]
;W[jl];B[jk]C[J: Hane is unreasonable here, simply extending is enough. White is pushing black towards the weak E12 group that nees protection anyway.]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[ij];B[kk]
(;W[hl]C[J: White should just turn from the ouside at H10. It's not clear if black will live anyway. See variation.]
;B[hm];W[gl];B[fl];W[gk];B[fk];W[gj];B[fj];W[ei];B[gi];W[hj]
;B[fi];W[jh];B[hf]C[J: H12 is a shape move for black, aiming to cut at K11.]

;B[mh]C[J: E2 might still be bigger.];W[li];B[mi];W[ld];B[kd]
;W[mb];B[md]C[J: N16 doesn't look like a legitimate threat, simply N17 is enough. White can take N17 himsself. See variation.]
