AB[pd][dp][pp]C[I attemted to add my own comments before asking for a review, I hope it helps.

**********
Hi, there! I am SadSido, an 11k player from Saint-Petersburg, Russia and I will review this game for both players.

I've added some variations, which seemed valid for me and also some comments to the key moves of this game. My final notices can be found in the comments to the last move.

If you find any grammar mistakes, please excuse me, as I am not a native speaker =)]
;W[dd]
(;B[ed]C[**********
It is a bad idea here to touch the white stone. The next move is White's, so White will have an advantage in this unnecessary fight. Better F16 or even less aggressive G16/]
;W[dc]
(;B[ee]C[**********
Bad choice, I think. Leaves White an option to dig under the wall and occupy the top.]
;W[ec];B[fc];W[qc]C[**********
Bad choice by White now. San-san invasion will net about 12 points for White, but will give Black a wall, facing... m-m-m... left maybe?]
(;B[qd]C[**********
I would rather prefer a wall, facing left, than bottom.];W[pc]
;B[oc];W[rd];B[re];W[sd];B[se];W[rb]
(;B[sc]C[**********
This move is wasted. White group is safe, better protect yours...]
;W[rc]
(;B[pb]C[**********
Oh. That's a bad idea. Black is too vulnerable to attack White. Just protect your nice wall and let White regret his San-San invasion. My option here is P15.]
;W[qe]C[**********
White definitely cuts. Now, Black should sacrifice the bottom part of the group and make a wall, facing left side. So, Q15.]
(;B[rf]C[**********
But Black chooses to save the bottom part. White will now consider cutting at P16.]
;W[qf];B[rg];W[qg]
(;B[rh]C[**********
Obviously, crawling by the second line is humilating. Black must sacrifice this group and protect the P16 cut]
;W[od]C[**********
Yep. Too late for Black here. Now, the plan is to sacrifice two Black stones. So, O16.]
;B[pe]
(;W[ob]C[**********
Werid move by White. Better to focus on attacking Q16 group.]
;B[nc];W[oe];B[pf];W[of];B[pg]C[**********
Somewhere here White understands, that both P15 and R15 groups are weak.]
;W[qh]
(;B[ph]C[**********
That's too kind for Black. White is asking for a little fight here, see R11 option]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[pi]
(;B[si]C[**********
I think, that Black chose the wrong group to save. Q16 seems more valuable than S15 to me...]
;W[oh];B[sg];W[og]C[Trying to save 3 groups at once has not worked, is there a better way to play?

**********
It was a complex situation with many threats for both sides. Usually, you must focus on saving only those groups, that are important enough. Q16 group was important, because it splitted White into two groups. S15 is not important as it runs on the second line.]
(;B[rj]C[**********
That's a totally wasted move. At the beginning of the game, you should focus on territory. There is not much territory in this move.]
(;W[pa]C[**********
White also wastes a move.];B[nb];W[oa];B[na]C[**********
Two sides are fighting for 4-5 points. Leave such moves for endgame and start gaining territory for now!]
;W[qb]
(;B[qj]C[**********
Also a wasted move. If you want to protect your upper "L-group", better reinforce it with simple N16]
;W[nd]C[I should have played somewhere around the "L" group, where is the best move?]
(;B[pj]C[**********
At this point I would rather consider your L-group lost. No need to save it, rather gain territory. Your Q10 could also be P9]
;W[mc];B[mb]C[**********
No. It cannot and should not be saved.];W[lb]C[**********
White is also ignoring the fact, that the group has no value at this point of the game. Better to develop upper-left corner or invade.]
;B[oj]C[**********
At last, some territory-oriented move. Nice!];W[ma]C[**********
White surprisingly kills! I wonder, what kind of threat did White see there?]
(;B[oi]C[**********
That move is no longer territory-oriented. Please consider variations.]
;W[gc]C[What is the best move?

**********
First, let's think of what do we want to get here. Take the corner? Impossible. Survive with E15 group? Maybe. Prevent White from taking the left side? That would be my choice. So, build a wall, facing bottom.]
(;B[ni]C[**********
Too close to your own stones. M11 would be more aggressive here.]
;W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[de]
(;B[he]C[**********
No, it is more important to block White underneath. Otherwise, our Black group won't be able to stay on the ground.]
(;W[fb]C[**********
Another wasted move by White. Better go for territory.]
(;B[hd]C[**********
What is the purpose of this move? Can it prevent White from connecting? Does it gain territory? Does it help stabilizing your own group? I guess, not. So, still better to go C14.]
;W[hc]C[**********
White makes a big mistake here, starting to chase Black. White is always one stone behind, so he gains miserable territory, helping Black to build a big wall. White should better switch the direction to E14 or even make move elsewhere.]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[id];W[ib];B[jd];W[kc];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[me]
C[How should I repond?

**********
White already helped a lot here, so M14 will be a nice and solid answer]
(;B[mf]C[**********
That's too aggressive. White will cut and capture.];W[lf];B[ke]
;W[mg];B[lg];W[nf];B[kf]
(;W[mf]C[**********
Bad move by White, letting Black shut him down in the corner. Better to prevent link between Black groups.]
;B[lh];W[mh];B[mi];W[nh]C[**********
White's move gets him one point. How many points are still there on the board?

Actually, White should resign here. Black's wall is now dominating the entire board...]
(;B[li]C[Is this a safe or wasteful move?

**********
This move is wasted. White cannot cut here, the Black has too many stones to handle the cut. Better D14 or tenuki. K4 looks nice.]
;W[ef];B[eg]
(;W[ff]C[**********
I think White should connect instead of looking for a trouble.]
;B[fg];W[gf];B[gg];W[hf];B[hg];W[if];B[ig];W[jf]C[**********
White is really looking for a trouble, as he ignored two or three chances to connect. Now, punish at D14.]
(;B[jg];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[ch];W[bg];B[bh]C[**********
The sequence is ok for Black.];W[be]
(;B[ag]C[**********
That is a typical endgame move. Black should look for bigger moves. K4 seems nice.]
;W[af];B[ah];W[ce]C[**********
White protects, but there is no danger here. White should look for some ways to save the game.]
;B[bc]C[Is there a way to make a living group in the corner?

**********
I don't see any way here. Only a White's bad mistake.];W[cb]
;B[bb];W[cc]C[**********
Actually, this move is unnecessary for White. Black still won't be able to make two eyes.]
;B[bd];W[dh]C[**********
With this cut White can only hope for a mistake by Black.];B[di]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[ci];B[cj];W[bi];B[fh];W[dh];B[eh];W[bj];B[ck]
;W[bk]C[**********
White is asking for a cut. But as long as he is trying to get territory on the second line, he should be allowed to do so. So, I think C8 is the answer]
(;B[bl];W[cl];B[bm];W[dl]
(;B[dk]C[**********
Three stones at C9 form a so-called "empty triangle". This form is best avoided, so better protect at E9.]
;W[ek]C[**********
That is the main reason for avoiding empty triangles. They are easily attacked.]
;B[dj];W[em]
(;B[cn]C[**********
Maybe black should try a more agressive D6? B8 stones are strong enough to be more agressive...]
;W[eo]
(;B[do]C[**********
Here: don't let White connect with the ground. Make him floating for as long as possible. So, E4.]
;W[ep];B[en]C[**********
You can push through White's position if you are hoping to make a cut. Otherwise is is a waste of stones.]
;W[fn];B[dn];W[gm]
(;B[dm]C[**********
Here I would rather try and cut with F5.];W[el]
(;B[kk]C[I probably should have approached white more

**********
This move is strange. You should not play close to your walls. You should rather force White to play close to your walls. The cut at F5 is still possible here, or maybe tenuki.]
;W[cm];B[bn]C[**********
Pointless exchange for both sides. Much more interesting moves were available a that moment]
;W[dq];B[cq];W[dr];B[cr];W[fq]C[**********
Good sequence for White, I think. Black's idea now is not to let White get territory on the bottom side, so maybe L3 or N3?]
(;B[er]C[**********
That threat can easily be handled by White, so better focus on gaining more territory.]
;W[eq]
(;B[fr]C[Quite a mistake

**********
Yes, better to ignore E2 stone at all and play L4 to get some big territory.]
;W[gr];B[ds];W[fs];B[cs]C[**********
Even now you are threatening White with about 6 points. This is awesome in the endgame, but not now.]
;W[es]
(;B[ir]C[**********
Too close to White's position. And why taking the second line? Maybe L4 or M3 is better?]
;W[iq];B[jr];W[jq];B[kr]
(;W[hr]C[**********
White's mistake here. Better push Black further on the second line]
;B[kq];W[qq]
(;B[pq];W[qp]
(;B[qr]C[**********
This move is not common. It is better to lock White in the corner, rather than let him expand on the side. So, R5 was the only correct move here.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[sp];B[pn];W[qm];B[pm];W[ql];B[pl]
;W[sq];B[rr];W[rq];B[sr];W[sn];B[rl];W[qk]C[**********
White's success. White has ruined Black's territory. Black recieved a wall instead, but this wall faces White group now and cannot be used to get much territory.]
(;B[rk];W[pk];B[ok];W[rm]C[Was there a way to not to let white steal as much territory?

**********
Yes. Consider the R4 option at move 174, or R5 option at move 176. The first variant (R4) seems better to me...]
;B[sm];W[sl];B[sk];W[sm]
(;B[jp]C[**********
Good move here. Maybe it is better to try L6 for more territory?]
;W[km]C[What is the best defensive move?

**********
The best defence is an offence here. Prevent White from connecting seems possible...]
(;B[ko];W[ip];B[jn]C[**********
That does not prevent White from connecting...];W[jl];B[jm]
;W[kl]
(;B[kn]C[**********
Why protect here? White cannot cut at neither K5 nor L4. So, better prevent White from connecting. White can easily resign after Black's J8, I think...]
;W[il]C[**********
Too late. White is connected now.];B[jk];W[ik]
(;B[jj]C[**********
Another empty triangle by Black. Avoid them. Better to risk and take J10.]
;W[ij];B[ji];W[ml]C[**********
White proceeds with ruining Blacks territory. Black should minimize the damage.]
(;B[ll];W[lm];B[lk];W[mn]C[**********
Lower territory worth more, so protect it.]
(;B[mk];W[nl];B[lp];W[ol];B[mo]
(;W[nk]C[**********
No idea of what is White trying to achieve with this move. Better proceed with ruining territory with O5]
;B[om];W[nn];B[nm];W[mm];B[im];W[gk];B[hm];W[hl];B[gn]C[**********
Maybe a reasonable counter-strike. White also has weaknesses...]

[js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[**********
I think, the game was interesting enough for both sides. Black missed some chances to win and let White recover.

Some final advice for both players:

* Go is about gaining territory, rather than killing enemy groups here and there. So, your main focus in the beginning of the game should be gaining influence over territory and not a close combat.

* Try to avoid unnecessary moves. Your move should either gain you some territory, or secure your group or prevent enemy from connecting or whatever. Avoid moves that do nothing.

* Learn to use walls. Black's main failure of this game is a failure to make use of his big and thick walls. 

I hope you enjoyed this game and this review. Best regards,
