AB[pd][dp]C[*masa13*: 
Hi!

Please could you comment on this game (played on IGS) I ended yp losing by 
about 40 points but lost a lot of stones in the centre at around move100 to 
move 130 (there is anoher note at move 100). Please also read teh 2nd 
comment I made at move 139/140 ish.

The above is what I want commenting on most but any other comments about any 
other play would be greatly appreciated - not having played all that many 
games myself it is difficult to know how good/bad the moves I make actually 
are, although instinctively I feel that I am playing too "small" and that I 
often end up reacting to an opponents moves rather than being 
proactive.];W[pp]TR[dd]C[Hello there =)

grettings from Germany. I hope you will understand my statements and that 
they will help to improve your abilities. Enjoy!

4-4 is a a good point, but if you have some handicap, you maybe could start 
with e.g. d12 a 3-4 point. best for practise und maybe easier to play?

With this joseki you will get sente, what could be better?]

the stones in the centre which, ultimately cost me the game. I really should 
have made life here but I would like to know if it was ultimately down to 
one crucial move or whether all of my play was wildly out!

The sequence in which I lost the middle runs from around here up to about 
move 130.

I think that ultimately I felt that I would easily be able to make life so I 
perhaps didn't play as tightly as I should have and made sure I had life.]

Well I showed you, your loosing move. And you shoudnt fight, if you dont 
know how it ends and if you have other options left.

Before you fight, check if you groups are alive and you maybe can get a 
connection to another of your groups. Dont forget the two main "go-rules"

1) Try to connect all of your stones and 2) try to disconnect your 
opponent's stones.

The more single groupes you have, the more chances has your opponent to kill 
your groupes. If your opponent wants to play / fight in the centre, let him. 
Your points are waiting in the corners and on the sides.];B[gf]
