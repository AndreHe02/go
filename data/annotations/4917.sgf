(;W[cd]C[***Piotr: should I play d15 or a pincer instead?

Basti: By touching your opponents stones you force him to strengthen himself by adding more stones. 
So when you want to keep the possibility to attack your opponents stones you should not touch them. 
This is a principle you should remember.];B[de]C[Basti: Now it looks difficult to invade around C13.]

Basti: You should use a wall to attack your opponents stones. Here you rather force your opponent to defend.]

[ae][ad][ac][ab][aa]C[***Piotr: once again, thank you for your time and comments!

Basti:  
1. Most important of all you have to improve your reading skills. The lower left corner showed that. Many times you could have ignored your opponent and still he should've not lived.
2. Actually this might be most important:
Play!! 80 games in 8 months is really not much. Try playing 2-3 games every day (ok, if you don't have the time it can't be helped...) and forget about reading books it's just a waste of time (and money) at your level. (see below)
3. Remember not to touch your opponents stones when you want to attack him.
4. Use your walls to attack.
5. Have a look at games from stronger players. You should concentrate on games from players that are just a little stronger than you, say 15k, so you will still understand what's going on on the board and get some new ideas from their play.

Here are some more webpages you may want to looks at:
http://senseis.xmp.net/ <- The Go-Wiki. I think I learned everything from there until I was around IGS 3k.
http://goproblems.com/ <- Lot's of Tsume-Go problems. Solving them should help you to avoid desasters such as in the lower left corner.

Btw: Here the sgf-file seems to be messed up again.])
