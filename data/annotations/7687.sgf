C[Hi, i'm Fnor, black in this game.

I used to be ~1kyu kgs during last summer (or 4kyu on IGS but i didn't play a lot on it) but nearly didn't play a game since then !

So it's very likely a did a lot of mistakes and want to know how correct them. I'll spot the moves i think i played wrong... but please also correct the ones i missed.

I'm not an english-speaker so i apologize for my english mistakes.]

C[I think he should approch the LF corner.];B[po]C[klin: This is OK.]
;W[pe];B[ph];W[oc];B[ob];W[nb]C[I don't know how to handle it.

I didn't think a lot before playing the next movement (very bad one i think) and paid it a lot.

I don't find any joseki with this move but don't know how to punish it.]
;B[pb]C[klin: Q18 should P16, then Q16];W[od]C[klin: Good for white here]
;B[qe];W[qf];B[qd];W[pg]
(;B[cd]C[Another bad habit...

Now, i think i should protect the right... by playing something like R12, or is my UL group in danger (the next move is very bad for me) ?]
;W[rf];B[rc];W[de];B[ce];W[df];B[db]C[klin: D18 should C13]
;W[dc];B[cc];W[eb];B[bg];W[ch]C[I think i've a lot of chance in this sequence because i end it in sente (he shouldn't respond).

But it's still not a great result, the upper edge is pretty big now.]
;B[mb];W[na]C[He did this mistake that allowed me to come back in the game.]

I did a lot of mistakes and only win because my opponent made worse.
I hope you will help me to correct them and go on in my go progression.

Thank you !
