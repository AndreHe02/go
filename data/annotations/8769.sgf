C[Hi there,

My name is Michael and I'll be reviewing your game.  

Sorry it took me so long.  I completely forgot.

Now that I'm done reviewing the game, here's some quick thoughts.  Be sure to read my much longer notes at the end.

White, you need to calm down.  Lots of moves that you played were tremendous overplays that would have resulted in ruin had you played someone just a few ranks higher.

Black, you need to learn how to respect strength, and learn how to fight.  This is just something that you start getting a knack for after playing for a while.

Both, you need to learn how to seal off territory.  You also need to learn how to invade.  There were good invasion spots that went untouched, and good groups to attack that went ignored for most of the game while you two were battling it out at the top of the board.  You also need to know when to leave a fight.  You always want to be the first person to leave the fight, assuming that something disasterous won't occur if you play away.]
;B[cp]
(;W[po]LB[pd:A]C[5-4 is a non-standard opening.  It's extremely unusual to open in this way.  Here's why:

Opening on the not opposite corner offers a cross opening at A.  Games with cross openings are generally charitarized as being very territorial games, and not moyo or influence games.  But 5-4 is a very influence based opening.

Further, you give away your hand.  You're saying you want to develop the side.  And for that you want a high stone near A for influence to make it difficult to invade or reduce the side.  But because you're offering A to black, you can't rely on it.]
(;B[dd]C[Black should play the cross opening here.  Because it puts white at a disadvantage, as I mentioned previously.]
;W[od];B[fq]LB[dq:A][eq:B]SQ[cn][hq]C[Something to remember about the large knight opening.  If you play it off of a 3-4 you're inviting reduction attempts and invasions.  Your opponent can play at A or B later in the game (especially if he has stones near the marked area.)

I'm not saying it's necessarily bad, just know that this is the meaning of this move.]
(;W[ni]C[Very, very greedy.]
(;B[oq];W[pq]C[This is not joseki.  The best way to play from here (for black) is as follows.]
(;B[op]C[The 5-4 joseki is full of traps.  :(  I don't like playing against 5-4.]
;W[pp]
(;B[jd]LB[oo:A]C[Too early.  White at A is big.  It will make Black's P3 stones heavy.  Black's stones are already in a bad situation.  Playing away is almost too painful.]
;W[jl]C[This move is also extremely greedy.];B[dk];W[kd];B[jc]
LB[cc:A][qc:D][md:H][qd:C][qe:B][cf:J][qm:E][dq:G][eq:F][mq:I]
C[I'm going to stop the game right here to point out some things before the first big fight.

The letters are possible invasion points.  It's OK to have invasion points, if you don't you're playing far too slowly.  But you should know where they are so you know the options available to your opponent or you.  And you should also judge how large they are so you know when to close them.]
;W[ig]C[I think this starts the whole sequence up in the top which ends with all the black stones in top-middle being taken.

How could I have played instead?

Michael:  White is playing like a madman.  This move, O11 and K8 are all massive overplays.  You just need to keep calm.  Don't think about "punishing" overplays.  Bad shape is its own weakness and your opponent will pay for it in terms of aji.  Despite the joseki mistake in the lower right corner,  I think the game is better for black at the moment.]

(;W[gb];B[fc];W[fb]C[Was F16 the right move or should I have played elsewhere (E18? F16 happened b/c I was worried white would break out from there and go further into my territory.

Michael:  F16 is a good move to my eye.  You have a LOT of shape issues here.  And although F16 doesn't seem like a good move, the long story short is you don't really HAVE any good moves.  See var for E18.]

Michael:  You must mean L11.  Remember that White isn't in any danger because he can capture your three stones at H6 at any point.  N6 is a very small move.  Right now.  Because your N7 clump of stones are pretty much dead by this point.  Check previous variations for some good ideas.]
;B[mo];W[mn];B[oo]C[Should I have played at P5 or at O6?

Michael: at this point, it's pretty much too late for those stones.  So P5 is a good way to maybe salvage something of the P3 group that hasn't had nearly enough love this entire game.]

C[The black chain at M-8 was dead when white played O8, so what was the point of *completing* the capture? I think the time would have been better spent elsewhere. I'd have played at J4/J5 if I was white.

Michael:  There is no point to completing this capture.  It was simply white being a jerk. :)  I get the feeling that white cares overmuch about the number of captured stones in his pile.  But that's good for Black!  Because if white didn't care about that a didn't give you several free moves your bottom would be dead.]

Although I guess the previous moves ((around M14) ate up 8 points of white territory and I lost 6 points with White's move at F4.

Was there a better option for Black?

Michael: Marked up in previous moves.];B[ep];W[fo];B[eo];W[fn]
;B[en];W[gg]C[Dame point.  No use playing it.];B[jr]C[Black territory point.  -1 point for black.]
;W[gh]C[Another dame point. 0 points.];B[df]C[This was the last move. I think I (black) did terribly and could have done better :-(

The good is that there's space for improvement since this was my ~10th game or so.

Let me know how you think I did - please be brutal if need be! :-)

I havent played on KGS yet and I had to enter in a rank, so I estimated 20kyu. Does that sound about right?

Michael: This last move wasn't needed. White cannot force you to fill it because white cannot atari your E14 group. (it has an eye).  This removed one point from your score.

I think you need to play more games.  Lower ranks are kinda fuzzy.  And it's very difficult for me to distinguish a 20kyu from a 25 kyu, let alone a 20kyu from a 21kyu.  :)  So I wouldn't be a good authority on what your rank is.  You both made a fair share of mistakes.  And as long as you learn from them you'll be out of the high kyus very soon.  

If forced I'd put this game at white 20 kyu, black 22 kyu.  But just one game doesn't prove anything.  Moreover, white's game is full of overplays so a large portion of white's win was just black not knowing how to counter overplays and black not knowing how to invade.

Don't worry about losing this game.  Losing games is completely fine.  As long as you learn from them.  Review every game you play.  Give a few of your game reviews to a higher ranked player, and learn the differences between how he or she thinks vs. how you think.  There's a go proverb that I'm sure you've heard (lose your first 50 games as quickly as you can.)

I tried to keep the review simple.  Concentrate mostly on the fighting.  And not so much direction of play.  I did a bit of fuseki at the beginning and I hope it didn't confuse you hopelessly.

If you have any questions about this review, please let me know, I'll be more than happy to clarify.]
