C[Dear Reviewer,
I am playing Black in this game. I lost by Resignation. I think my main errors were due to wrong strategic decisions I made - I need your help to identify them and show me the right way.

Thanks!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[Just like a Pro game so far. :-)]
;W[cj];B[jd]C[Good.  Expand your moyo while limiting white's.]
;W[nq]
(;B[lp]C[i think it would be better to just respond with Q6 here.  white will have to make another move on the lower right, and you should end up with sente so you can take a big point.  The proble with the 1 space high pincer is that it lets white settle too easily.  If you really want to pince, use the 1 space low pincer. see the variation.]
;W[no];B[pn];W[pr];B[qq];W[lr]C[Now the stone at O5 is pushing out into your moyo.  O7 will be a big point for both sides.]

(;B[fq]LB[cn:B][fq:A]C[Is it the right approach? Or is C6 better?

I think this is OK.];W[hq]
(;B[fo]LB[fo:A][cq:B]C[Should I have entered the 3-3 point?

I would just jump in at 3-3.  The stone at C10 is on the third line, as is the H3 stone, so black can't get a big moyo efficiently.  the 3-3 invasion is seldom wrong when your approach to the 4-4 is pincered.]
;W[dn];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip];W[jq];B[jp]C[Now white has territory on the left side and on the bottem center, and all black has is thickness in the center.  With the O6  and d6 stones in place, it will be hard to use the thickness for much.   This is why it is usually right to invade at 3-3 after a pincer.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[The O17 stone is already pincered by the K16 stone.  Pincering again is ineffecient.  I would just respond at Q14, or play as in the variation.  Your move is using two stones to do one job.]
;W[qf]
(;B[nd]C[I am not sure about this move.

In general it is wrong to touch a weak stone.   It just makes it stronger.   In this game, I wouldn't touch either of the stones. See the variation.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[mc]
(;B[me]C[P17 is the move to make good shape here.  It cuts off whites access to the corner, so he has to run into the center.  The R14 stone will be swallowed up automatically.]
;W[ld]
(;B[kc]LB[kc:A][le:B]C[In view of what happened later, seems to me that M15 and sacrificing M17 is much better, since it creates a huge moyo for Black. What do you say?

When you are thinking about sacrificing a stone, think about what function the stone serves.  In this case, the M17 stone serves to keep white from making a base along the side, so I think it is useful to save it.]
;W[le]
(;B[qh]C[Once again, this stone is already pincered.  P17 is the move that keeps white weak on the top, and with two weak groups, white won't have time to save them both.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc]
(;B[fc]C[P16/17 is still a big point for both sides.  When you are in a contact fight with your opponent, keep playing until your are both stable. Your stones at Q16 only have 4 liberties, so that are not stable.  You can play P16 in sente and get F17 later.]
;W[df];B[fe];W[od];B[oe];W[oc];B[pf]LB[pe:B][pf:A]C[Seems to me Q15 is better

Yes, much better.  Always make a solid connection unless there is some good reason not to.]
;W[rd];B[dh];W[re]
(;B[pg]C[Is this move really needed?  What bad things happen if you play elsewhere?]
;W[eg];B[dj];W[ck];B[cf];W[ce];B[dg];W[ef];B[bf];W[bh];B[ci]
C[This move just makes white stronger.  Don't push against the knights move unless you plan to cut.]
;W[bi];B[cg];W[dk];B[ej];W[ec];B[ee]C[E15 seems to me wrong. I wanted to steal Black's eye, by it created an empty triangle as well as aji-keshi.
What do you think?];W[de];B[eb];W[db]
(;B[ed]C[This move just helps white fix his shape.];W[dc];B[fb]
C[Here, black ended in gote because of the wasted e16 move.  In general, you shouldn't force your opponent to make move that he has to make anyway.]
;W[ek];B[fj];W[nm];B[pl];W[dr];B[mn];W[nn];B[ll];W[gl]C[At this point seems to me White leads. Black's moyo in the center is ineffective, because it is open from all directions (E14, M15, G8, O7). It is now an up-hill battle for Black.

White has about 20 in the upper right, 30 in the lower left,  and about 15 in the lower center.  

Black has about 25 on the right, and about 20 in the top center, and something in the center, so you are correct, white is leading.   The upper left corner may have problems though if black can enclose it.   I might try something like G13 and see what white does.  See the variation.

I think the game was difficult because of the mistakes made in the opening.  The M4 and  F5 moves and the wasted moves at M17 and R12  let white get ahead and later it was difficult to catch up.  Making a Ko in the upper left later in the game was good and gave black a chance to win, but by then it was probably too late.  

I hope the comentary helps you get stronger.  Feel free to ask if you have any questions.]

;W[ad]
(;B[mo]LB[bn:B][mo:A]C[This is defintely wrong, since it White's middle group can easily connect to M15. But even if Black saves C6 group by B6, it is still not enough for Black.

Perhaps we should count.  White has 15 in the upper left, 20 in the upper right, and maybe 10 in the left if the B6 group lives, and about 15 on the bottom, for a total of  about 60.  Black has more than 30 on the right side,  about 20 in the lower center, and maybe 15 elsewhere, for a total of 65.  It looks to me like B6 would win the game if white ignores it.  at least the game would be very close.]

Black has about 20 in the upper center,  and about 30 on the right  for a total of 50, plus potential to make more in the center.  The game will be difficult from here on, but it doesn't  look hopeless.  Maybe a move around F8 will make some territory in sente and them black can take m14 and get some profit there and pick up the 20+ points needed.]
