C[Hello and thankyou to whoever is reviewing this, its Canadian 10 sec 25 moves, and I thought it was a pretty good game personally, by my standards :)

I don't say anything on a lot of my fighting moves, assuming whoever you are is much better than me, I imagine my intentions will be obvious.

I am Filtertip 5k

Or Henry ;)

[EV\] Hello, this is your reviewer Eric Vella.  
My comments will be marked [EV\].];B[qd]C[Filtertip [5k\]: hello]
;W[dp]C[Filtertip [5k\]: enjoy the game];B[pp]C[daniug [4k\]: hi]
;W[dc];B[od];W[qj];B[qh]C[I'm always wondering which move to make after r10, between r12 and r8 (going for the double wing afterwards and pushing w towards my shimari). I hear r12 is better though, but it would be nice to get some explanation

[EV\] Both B moves are good.  At this early stage, it is just a matter of personal style which to play.  B can also play elsewhere, waiting to see which move looks best later, letting W play here first if he wants.]
;W[qn]
(;B[np]C[here, I think I may have made a mistake, I have a nagging feeling r8 is joseki and I'm giving away advantage needlessly.

[EV\] Extending in this direction is natural and good.  R8 can also be played in this position, as a sacrifice to get quicker development on the bottom (see variation).]
;W[rp]C[Filtertip [5k\]: sorry about that
Filtertip [5k\]: bad connection];B[qq]C[daniug [4k\]: ok];W[pl]
;B[de]C[It's the moves like this that I am never sure about, reasonably early fuseki. My main aim here was simply to stop him making a shimari, I have a book which said they were normally the biggest plays.

[EV\] Good.];W[fd];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[dh]C[I didn't want to 3rd line here because it seemed a bit too passive to me, perhaps I should have though, not certain.

[EV\] This move is not joseki, although it is not a big mistake.  The third line moves C12 and C11 are joseki.  This move leaves the bottom open, making a W play at C10 tempting.  Of course this move is stronger toward the center, but W has a settled group above, limiting the outward influence of this stone.]
;W[ck];B[cm]C[I was more or less just trying to be aggressive here and push c9 a bit towards my framework on the left.

[EV\] This looks playable, if you want a fighting game.  You can forget joseki now -- the rest of the game will be decided by the fight launched here.]
;W[ek];B[em]C[that seemed natural

[EV\] Yes, this is natural.  You could also consider the attachment at C4, offering to let W capture C7 in return for the corner, or getting a foothold on the side if W protects the corner.]
;W[fp];B[fl]C[so did this.

[EV\] The one space jump is perhaps more natural, getting out into the center faster, and also putting a little more pressure on the W stones below.]
;W[fk];B[hl]C[ditto, although I was thinking of h7 instead, perhaps to get further away from W's strength.]
;W[gk];B[im]LB[fn:B][hn:A]C[this was just the best way i could find to protect the cut.

[EV\] This connection is not good -- it leaves W too many useful forcing moves (A or B, maybe both if W pushes once first).  Either connect directly at G8 to build up strength or look for something more efficient which also affects the bottom.  How about H5 or even H4?  Try playing some variations and see if W can profitably cut after either of these moves.]
;W[fh]C[[EV\] Good move by W.  The surrounded B group is going to suffer.]
;B[eg]C[trying to stop him connecting while consolidating territory.

[EV\] This move actually helps W connect, but I am not sure you can cut, so it may be necessary to live.  F13 or F14 or F15 would be attempts to stop W from connecting, but they are all very complicated, beyond my ability to read out.]
;W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[fe];W[ge];B[gd]C[something in one of my last few moves did not work properly, this dies :( And I do not even cut.]
;W[hd];B[gc];W[hc];B[he]LB[gg:A]C[[EV\] This is the first really bad mistake of the game.  W is already connected above (by capturing two B stones), so despite appearances this move is not really a cut.  The cut at A, on the other hand, would actually disconnect and threaten the W center stones.  You could play A directly (after checking that W cannot capture it with a ladder or geta), or you could play a move like J10 to strengthen the center, forcing W to guard the cut, then get the first move at the bottom, which is huge.]
;W[hg];B[ie];W[gb];B[id];W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[fc];W[ed];B[kc]
;W[kb];B[lc];W[iq]LB[bh:A]C[I did get some nice influence out of it in the end though, but in exchange I gave him some territory and certain life for all his stones. Bad I think. My stones in the upper left also look very weak now.

[EV\] W did better here, after the mistaken B cut.  The move at A now looks like a serious threat, probably scooping out all of the B territory in sente.]
;B[cq]C[I did this purely to invade his territory.

[EV\] This is a good move, particularly since B is behind.]
;W[cp]
(;B[dr]LB[bp:A]C[[EV\] The hane at A is more usual, forcing W to choose between territory and attack.  See the variations.  This move also seems playable, but both sides make mistakes in the continuation.]
;W[dq];B[cr];W[er];B[bp];W[bo];B[aq];W[cn];B[kq]C[[EV\] The lower left corner is a textbook life-and-death problem which occurs frequently in real games.  B is not completely alive.  If you spend some time studying it, I guarantee the effort will win you a game sometime in the future.  However, your move at L3 is very big, making territory and helping the weak center stones, so leaving the corner alone for now is possible.]
;W[ao]C[I didn't see this, which is annoying as pushes down to the first line are something I am trying to pay more attention to.

[EV\] I will leave you to read out the variations in this life-and-death problem.  After this W move (not best), B can make 100% life.]
;B[fr];W[es];B[fq];W[eq];B[gp];W[hp];B[br];W[go];B[ap];W[jo]
C[[EV\] W has the right idea -- separate the B groups and attack the center -- but this move looks a little awkward and inefficient.   This is a perfect situation for a leaning attack at L4, pressing against the stronger bottom group to develop strength for the attack on the weaker center group.]
;B[lo]C[after K5 I tried not to be bullied and thought m5 looked nice. I always like that l3 - m5 - o4 shape although I have never heard anyone say it was strong or weak, the stones seem to work well together.]
;W[lb];B[mc];W[kn];B[jk]C[this connection as well, involving l9 - h8 - k7. I have never seen any books or websites saying it was good, but it seems to work very well.]
;W[bh]C[[EV\] W finally hits the vital spot.];B[bi]C[here I tried to take sente.]
;W[ci];B[ch]LB[bg:A]C[[EV\] This move is extremely dangerous!  Did you check whether W could respond by extending at A?  If he can, your position will collapse.  You might have to clamp at A here yourself instead of cutting.]
;W[bj];B[bg];W[rh];B[rg];W[ri];B[qg];W[jg];B[lk]C[Was this too small? Is a longer connection a good idea here? I was a bit worried about the chance of being split though. These are my weakest stones at the moment and I did not want to take risks

[EV\] This looks good.  Some move around here is necessary for safety (picture a W stone at M9).]
;W[lg];B[mb];W[ln];B[nk]C[still worried about my stones, perhaps I went in the wrong direction here though?

[EV\] You should be worried, even with this move.  The center group is very thin.  W should continue the attack.]
;W[rq];B[ng]C[He is obviously not going to try and split me there, and S3 probably signalled beginning of yose.]
;W[ai];B[jr];W[fn];B[gl];W[ir];B[rr];W[qp];B[pq];W[sg];B[sf]
;W[sh];B[re];W[ag];B[bf];W[ke]C[I think I should have been much more aggressive here, and not have let him do this. An earlier move at l14 could have been a good idea, I think.

[EV\] No, I don't think B can prevent this.  Any W response to L14 would weaken the center B stones, which are still not safe.  B may need forcing plays at M12 or L12 to help the center group.]
;B[le];W[kf];B[kd];W[jq];B[kr];W[ij];B[mi]LB[kl:A]C[this was me connecting again, I really did expect to be attacked...

[EV\] Good.  Are you sure J10 did not threaten to cut?  How would you answer a W peep at A now?  (Just asking -- I think you have a good response, but it takes a bit of reading.)]
;W[sr];B[qr]C[The rest is pure yose, so any mistakes I made I can't really see, seeing as I only played them a few hours ago :)

[EV\] Nothing eventful happened after this, so my comments end here.]

There, I thought this was a good game and very close the whole way through... (although W got no komi). Any help whoever is doing this review can give me is hugely appreciated.

Thankyou!

C[[EV\] W can play this way if he is sure he can handle the cut.  B needs to return to play D3 to live in the corner (unless this cut kills something).]
)
(;W[dq];B[br];W[cr];B[bq]C[[EV\] Possible W continuation to keep sente and some territory.]
)))
(;B[ql];W[on];B[nq];W[pk];B[qo];W[rn]C[[EV\] This sequence is played frequently.  The B sacrifice stone still has lots of aji.  On the other hand, W can still invade the B corner.]
