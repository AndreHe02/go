C[F: Hello. Thanks for the game, I tried to do my best. Actually You have totally lost fuseki, so it was not possible to win, unless your opponent made mistakes. I will try to focus you on some basic things you have to improve firstly.]
;B[pc]C[Bl00Dragon [13k?\]: Hi Good Luck];W[pq]TR[pe]SQ[pp]
C[F: Not too good as it could be.. Black is welcome to attack at Q5-R5... This is pretty standart and nothing too dangerous, but you will loose some game tempo and if you are not enough experienced you may face big problems... In this case I advice to make a move at 4-4 pont (marked as square). If black does not start to play agressively you will have a great move at triangle point.]
;B[dd];W[cp]SQ[dp]C[F: I'd love to play 4-4 here. Your base is unstable in many ways.. If black starts playing agressively you man not have enough experience to save your positions.]
;B[qo]
(;W[nq]SQ[op]C[F: You stay too low. Black has a nice sente move at P4 now . You loose tempo to defend, black will build a nice base on the right. You have 2 options (see variations):
- O4
- Pincer];B[op];W[oq];B[pl]C[F: Black already has big advantage. See variations for bigger moves that can save the situation]

(;W[eq]C[F: This is why I adviced to play 4-4. Weak players need to defent 4-3 move not to loose a side/corner. And now if B plays a safe move on the left (see variation) W is in great trouble]

(;B[pe]C[F: This is a mistake for B.. too slow move.. Because you can not attack here.. see variation and never attack in such positions]

(;W[cj];B[jc]C[1]
(;W[cc]C[F: The same as Q15 move.. You invade, but only make B stronger. B will reply with D17 and will make a wall + huge moyo that will be easily turned into territory. Here is a place where you can 100% resign (at this point I am not joking. fuseki is lost.)

Instead of this you have a great number of bigger moves around the board]
;B[dc];W[cd]C[F: There is a standart sequence of moves for 3-3 invade.. See variation and leanr it. You have overplayed a bit.]
;B[ce];W[be];B[cf];W[bf]C[F: B mistake. see correct moves for both sides]

(;B[cg]C[F: Here is your overplay. see variation.]
(;W[bg]C[F:];B[je]C[F: Too slow for B... B will probably attack around K4.. so you better protect or invade/reduce]
;W[ch];B[ef];W[db];B[eb];W[bb]C[F:  C1 is better. You leave a weak point at D19]

(;B[fc]C[Ok Here when i saw the large moyo he started making,i didn't know where to start and invade.How do i reduce this large frame.I was a little lost.]
;W[eh]C[F: A very slow move. Better play around K3 or reduce/invade.]
;B[gg]
(;W[fg]C[F: it's stupid to attack. B can easily defend and become stronger.]
;B[ff];W[gh];B[hg]SQ[fg][ch][eh][gh][cj]C[F: sure you should not reply here.. Your shape is weak. So you better protect the bottom, which is bigger]

(;W[hh];B[jp]C[Here should i respond or not..Should i enlarge my moyo?Don't know how to do it effectevly.]

;W[fl];B[hl];W[ij];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh];W[mc]C[At this point i though it was time to invade and reduce B moyo.i though it was suicide but i didn't know where to invade.]

[pf][pg]C[Here Where should i play so i don't get enclose by B group.

F: W is dead here.. Black should not attack, just prevent W from building 2-eyes shapes. As I have already said, it is too late for W to do something against B in the top-right]

F: No ;) It was dead from the beginning =) If B plays correct.. It's toooo difficult or even impossible to live. Try to play better at opening (fuseki) because this concret game was lost by the 20th move]

;B[ol];W[ir];B[tt]C[My overall question would be about making moyo.How do i play so i don't get enclose by the enemie and get myself enprison without being able to build my moyo?Where should i play effectively my stones?Without all the time trying to invade the enemie who is making a lot of territorie.
Of course beside that and overall approach of the playing style of where and why play here or respond here and there.

F: Sorry, but at this moment I'd advice you to improve fuseki. This will be far more helpful for you. I hope I helped you.]

(;W[jq];B[ii];W[hh];B[ih];W[gk]SQ[kj][mj][nj][pj][qj]C[F: Whenever you loose sente it is better to start closing your moyo if you do not have bigger moves. At this point B gets lot of territory on the top-right, but it too LATE to stop B. You have lost fuseki so now B is unstopable]
))
(;W[gi]SQ[gk][gm][fo]C[F: try to combine 3 things: 1) Do not play too close so B can only put some pressure on you but cannot attack directly, You make B go to the center slower and try to build your moyo at the same time (squares).]
