C[vin: The time limits used were 1/11.]PL[B];B[pd];W[qp];B[dd]
;W[cq];B[jd]C[vin: I nearly always play the Sanren-sei.];W[nc]
C[This is bad against a san-ren-sei. It's better to play from the outside at R14 or C14.]
;B[oc];W[nd];B[pf];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd];B[je];W[lf];B[dj];W[cf]
C[Again White plays in one of Blacks strong areas. Not a good idea, White is asking for trouble.

vin: I was unsure of the correct direction to play from here.

I think playing from above and tacking territory while attacking white is ok. But I would prefer B16. This avoids strengthening the white stone as C15 does.]
;B[ce];W[df];B[ch];W[dh];B[di];W[eh];B[dn];W[do];B[en];W[cc]
C[Maybe better to separate white now with B16 or B15. When White connects with B15 after D17 the pressure on him is a lot lower. Furthermore Black is trying to make territory with his wall on the K-line. Bit thw white stones around E14 are looking towards reducing it.]
;B[dc];W[be];B[eo];W[dp];B[op];W[mq];B[qj]C[This feels slow. Go is a game of separating the opponents stones and connecting ones own stones. For this reason I would prefer a move like R3.]
;W[qm];B[on];W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[ol]C[vin: Looking back this seems very bad for black. White has secure territory in the corner and blacks stones in the lower right don't do much of anything. What should I have done ?

Instead of P8 better O2-Q2-O3. Separate. :-)];W[gd]C[vin: I should have defended here earlier.

NO, this would have been far too slow. Instead of G16 White should play O2.]
;B[fe];W[ge];B[ff];W[hf];B[ke];W[le];B[jg];W[if];B[kg];W[hh]
;B[cd];W[bd];B[kq]C[??? Why did you exchange C16 for B16 if you not capture at B17 afterwards?

And lokaly O2 is the point, not L3.];W[nr];B[fh];W[ee];B[fd]
;W[cb];B[ed]C[Unbelievable shape. Of course better at G17.]
;W[fi];B[gh];W[gi];B[gc];W[hc];B[hb];W[gb];B[fc];W[ib];B[hd]
;W[ic];B[fb];W[ha];B[id];W[jb];B[gf];W[he]C[vin: I considered A and B here and finally chose A.]
;B[hi];W[ih];B[ef];W[de];B[dg];W[cg];B[ei]C[vin: This was the thinking behind black 77.]
;W[gk];B[fk]C[vin: I think this was a bad move as it only served to strengthen whites three stones, while weakening blacks cutting stone.

Agree, simply capturing is better.];W[gj];B[eg];W[li];B[ki]

;W[hj];B[fp];W[ep];B[gp];W[ip]C[vin: On reflection variation 2 would have been much better, but we were both low on time at this point.]

(;B[iq];W[jp];B[kp];W[jq];B[hm]C[vin: During the game I was overly concerned about making X a false eye.]
;W[im];B[hq];W[jr];B[kr];W[gr];B[fr];W[gq];B[hr];W[gm];B[hn]
;W[mn];B[il];W[ek];B[dl];W[ej];B[dk];W[fj]C[vin: A play at X would start a ko.]
;B[fq];C[vin: My opponent ran out of time at this point, we were both short of time. I regret not adding time as I would have liked to have played this one out.

vin: I think I had the upper hand at this point, but I talso hink that I had been fortunate that my opponent had not punished my mistakes. I think I took too many risks, and left too many stones weak and vulnerable. I also was lucky in the fighting at the bottom.

vin: I would be grateful for any comments on this game, and I thank you in advance.

I agree that black is leading now. Sorry that I didn't comment on all of your remarks but I could not see the letters you mentioned.]
