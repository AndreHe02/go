;B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[dc];B[oq];W[jj]C[***************
This move by white is unusual, of course, but its not really a good move. It seems to establish a large side framework, but the area on the left is too open. Black can invade and create a strong group inside easily. Once this happens, K10 is not particularly useful.]
;B[jc];W[cj];B[qj];W[jq]C[White's framework looks bigger than black's but it is thinner; black is at no disadvantage.]
(;B[ce]C[**********
Invasion is a good idea, but the bottom left is where white has more potential - the invasion should be there.]
;W[cd];B[de]C[I always think it's hard to answer c16... never sure of what to do...

*******************
This is correct. Nearly always standing up like this is correct.]
(;W[qc]C[*****************
While this is a big move, it solidifies black's postion. White's position is too thin and black will be able to wreck it well.

White should continue to harrass the black stones on the left. This will allow him to solidify his postion in sente.]

**********
My pleasure.

Both White and Black made some slow moves to start the game, but black really pulled ahead when White spent two moves capturing two stones on the top while black established a postion on the left side in white's moyo. However black did not capitalize well on his good moves by letting his stones get sealed.

Then Black came close to losing the game by making several slow moves at the top instead of expanding the right and leaving his weak group unprotected. However, white did not make a good Ko threat, and black was able to save the group without extensive damage.

Both Black and White then kept fighting over the top borders which were not as important as the right. Then at move 116, Black had an opportunity to kill the white group which he did not exploit until 90 moves later.

White then made a strategic error of walling off the left territory, permitting black to seal off the much larger right territory. White made several failed attempts to reduce the black territory. At this point black has won, even though white succeeded in reducing the top.

White continued to make errors in the endgame, falling still further behind, until black finally killed the left white group.

I hope this is helpful. Good luck with your future games..]
