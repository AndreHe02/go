C[this game was played against a 27 K (white) and im black, 28k  i wanted to know where i made the big mistakes, adn what i could have done to stop my opponent from cleaning the board with me.

hello I am quarrel, I will do my best to review your game];B[po]
C[oh no...got to get out the joseki book for this one!];W[dd]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[oq]C[can't be bad];W[dj];B[fd]C[i felt confident here, , maybe a bit too confident

nothing particularly wrong with it...but extensions from shimaris like yours in the lower right are always very big...j4 for example]
;W[df];B[ff];W[dh];B[fh];W[jd]C[yes..you needed to secure a base on the top first]
;B[ie];W[je];B[jf];W[nd]C[about here is when i realised i was in trouble

well white has strong positions - his move at d12 was kind of unnecessary but it does completely secure his left side, and he has an ideal position on the top, and your group on the top doesn't have a base, but it still isnt all that bad]
;B[oe];W[ne];B[ng]C[this is optimistic..a lower extension on the left would be ok..your move does not make white too worried because both of your positions are thin...white should take advantage of it

if you want to attack white's position here you can limit his potential territory with j16 - his h17 is a big move later]
;W[od];B[pf]C[p14 would give you a more solid wall, no cutting points]
;W[of];B[pe]
(;W[nf]C[white could play through here at p13 and pick a fight

see variation for a possibility];B[og];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg];B[lh]
C[your wall is still not solid but you have very good prospects on the right..white is being very kind, allowing you to bend him while you stake out a claim to the right]
;W[kh];B[kg]C[aggressive move, but remember white has a cutting point at o12 (do you see that a ladder does not work there?)

white will be able to live on the top, so these moves are still nowhere near as big as an extention on the lower side or a move on the right]
;W[kf];B[jg];W[jh];B[ih]C[did you see the double atari at m14?  if so, your are correct that it is not as big as other moves on the board because white will still be alive]
;W[kj];B[ji];W[ki];B[jj];W[kl];B[il]C[again you have the right idea (putting pressure on white while you build a wall), but your walls are full of cutting points for white to exploit - o12 captures 2 stones and is devastating for black, and also see variation for another weakness]

(;W[le]C[white has a secure position now, but it is not very big compared to what you could have on the right]
;B[ml]C[good in principle, but the weakness in the wall at o12 makes it kind of ineffective..2 spaces up would be good, saves the cutting point and therefore attacks white]
;W[kn]C[if white does not try to exploit your weaknesses at all, he will definitely lose this fight]
;B[in]C[this move does not make territory (white has strong positions on the left), so perhaps playing an extension on the bottom would put pressure on white as well as give you nice territory]
;W[lp]C[too late];B[mo];W[lo];B[mp];W[ip]C[good move for white - he is just about safe]
;B[jk]C[good..repairs your wall and threatens white];W[kk];B[ln]
C[there is not much urgency here];W[lm];B[mn];W[jo]C[white has good prospects now]
;B[ll]C[i was a little too deperate here, i couldent seem to contain him, and by here it went down hill

not sure what your thinking is with this move..white's group has better chances now, so your best bet here is probably to secure your wall facing the right..n10 maybe?
you can also keep putting pressure on white's group and try to make some territory for your left group simultaneously]
;W[gp]C[now white is looking very good..your group on the left is now cut off and very attackable (at the very least white can constrain you and limit your territory while he gets points in the lower left region)

but if you would really secure territory on the right you still have a good game]
;B[ic]C[good..making eye space and threatening white, but again right side is bigger]
;W[jc];B[id];W[pc]C[white should invade your right side or take some points by attacking in the g6-g9 vicinity]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[sb]C[well done, black is probably better off than white in this exchange]
;W[oc];B[mj]C[very good!  did you see that it stops the weakness at o12 as well?]
;W[ec]C[big..your top group needs eye space - but not as big as an invasion on the right or attack in the lower left quadrant]
;B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[db];B[jb]C[endgame move, and gives up sente]
;W[kb];B[ja];W[ka];B[hb];W[gn]C[white looks a little overconcentrated in both the lower left and the upper left..but there is not much chance of invasion now except at c3, and he is getting huge territory in the left]
;B[fl]C[this looks more solid than it really is...white can poke holes in you and cut around f10 and g8..for territory alone f10 or g9 would probably be better moves]
;W[el]C[white is submissive, you got off easy];B[fj];W[fm];B[gl]
C[you have an attack at e9, whites wall is thin];W[dq]C[after you secured your wall on the right the 3-3 point here became quite big, but white would still be better off invading the right side

other big areas to look at now are n3 area and your own 3-3 in the lower right]
;B[lr]C[i would have played one point higher..there could be some weakness here at n3, but good positional judgement]
;W[kr]C[strange];B[lq];W[kq];B[jm];W[km];B[fa]C[white is correct to ignore it...another endgame move]
;W[qk]C[im horrible at stopping invasions, i dont know where i can go to stop them, please if its not too much trouble,  show me an alternate way to stop white, because i obviously couldent do it

finally white invades];B[qj]C[hmm...remember attachments like this make the invading stone stronger.  you don't need to be quite so aggressive because white can cause problems now.  I would play one point higher, and white will probably play r6 or r7 for eye space..you will still make good territory as you attack white's weak group]
;W[rj];B[pk]C[you need to play r11];W[qi];B[pj];W[ql];B[sk]
;W[rl];B[qm]C[again right idea but attachments can cause problems..play around r6 or r12 (r12 would be an ok attachment because it is a direct threat on whites stones)

see variation, for whites attack]
(;W[rm];B[rn]C[be very careful when you make plays like this - work on reading out the sequences.  white cuts in atari at r6, you must save your stone with q7, and white takes your s6 stone by playing s5]
;W[qn]
(;B[ro];W[pm];B[ri]C[if you meant to sacrifice this to contain white, you would be better to play r12 or q11 or even s13]
;W[rh];B[qh];W[si];B[pi];W[ri];B[rg]C[same deal with the cutting points..i would recommend getting some problem books like Graded Go Problems for Beginners (available on amazon) - they will help you read sequences]
;W[qg];B[qf];W[ph];B[oh]C[at least you saved your o12 cutting point]
;W[rf]C[when white captures a stone like this, it is generally best to play s15 and force him to take - that way you get sente and can play elsewhere]
;B[pg];W[sg];B[qh];W[rg];B[re]C[i resigned right after i went at s15, i knew i was lost way before, but i tooks me chances

you would have done alright if you had seen the simple 2 or 3 move sequences that white used to take your stones.  your main weakness seems to be that you do not see the problems white can cause by cutting through your walls where you leave them thin.

if its any consolation white is much stronger than he claims, but if you had contained his invasion you could have had a closer game

feel free to email me back the game with more comments at ben123@fuse.net  - hope my review helped]
