C[Dear Reviewer,

I play black in this game.

I would appreciate any criticism, especially regarding my opening strategy (or lack thereof).

Thank you,
Jay

N: Hi, I play as Numsgil (2k) on KGS.  It's good to meet another Jay :)  I've marked all my with 'N'.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qn];W[ci];B[jc]TR[jp][jq]C[N: The bottom side is bigger, since you have the enclosure from the 3-4 point.  Playing around triangle probably makes sense, though other moves are also possible.  This is a relatively minor point, though.]
;W[qj];B[pk]MA[qg][qh][ph][pg]C[N: This is the wrong way to attack a stone.  By playing in an adjacent space, you're just encouraging white to get stronger.  Don't play adjacent to a lone enemy stone if your goal is to attack it.  You should pincer it instead from around the X's.]
;W[qk];B[qh]LB[pl:A]C[Perhaps I should have played A?

N: It makes your last move seem silly if you don't, but it wasn't a good move to begin with.  Playing this way might actually be better.]
;W[pl];B[nh]TR[oh]CR[jp][jq]C[N: This is too thin.  Just one space jump to triangle is fine.

You don't want to get in to a situation later where white can set up a profitable invasion on the other side of your stone here.

Alternatively you can just play elsewhere.  This side isn't all that big for either of you.  Maybe circle?]
;W[qm];B[rn]TR[pn]C[N: Don't extend down in the early game.  It's better to extend up and build up influence.  You'd extend down if you thought you could kill this group, but you can't really.]
;W[pn];B[qp]TR[po]C[N: This is too passive.  Play at triangle.  You'd be able to push white out and build up bottom territory at the same time.]
;W[po];B[qc]CR[jq]C[N: I think the bottom is still bigger.  Somewhere around circle (playing low makes more sense than playing high, since your prospects of a moyo are limited).]
;W[oq]C[N: This feels like an overplay from white but I'm not sure how to punish him without starting a whole board battle.]
;B[or];W[nq];B[nr];W[jq]C[N: White gets this point now.  It's very big, yes?]
;B[mq]TR[cq]C[N: Now's a good time to try invading, since white has both of the wings for his 4-4 stone.  You should be able to either get sente from this or a lot of points.  Since there aren't any urgent points on the board right now, points are good.]
;W[gq]C[N: It's difficult for you to do much about the bottom now.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[bp];W[bo];B[bq];W[cn];B[er];W[fq]
;B[fr];W[gr];B[ar]C[N: You don't need to do this.  This group is alive without this move.  If you don't feel confident about that, practice playing variations until you are :)]
;W[ap];B[op]TR[ce][de][df][cf]C[N: Problem is this isn't worth many points.  Playing around triangle to disrupt the enclosure would be better.]
;W[gc];B[hd]C[N: This might be okay here, since you're not attacking but leaning on stones to build a moyo.  But white is getting points from this exchange, too.]
;W[gd];B[he];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[ih];W[np];B[mp]TR[gi][hj][ij]
[jk]CR[no]C[N: This doesn't get you much. Play the ladder breaker instead at one of triangles.  The stones aren't important, so if white insists on saving them you get a free move.  If not, he has to play with a constant eye to keeping the ladder good for him.

If you insist on playing down here, play at circle and chase the other way.  You might be able to build up an attack on the white group to the right.]
;W[no];B[eh]TR[gi]C[N: This is too deep.  You just need to reduce white a bit.  Again, triangle is probably just fine.]
;W[pp]
(;B[qr]C[N: Sacrifice some bottom stones to take sente.  See variation.]
;W[gi];B[gh]C[N: If you don't have a clear idea what you want to achieve, you shouldn't play like this.  You want to help stones on both sides of this stone, which is inconsistent with playing a wedge like this.]
;W[hh];B[fh];W[hg];B[ig];W[ii];B[ge];W[fe];B[fd];W[fc];B[ff]
;W[ed];B[fg];W[hi];B[ej];W[ef];B[ki]CR[hk][hl]C[N: I'm not sure there's time for this.  You're stones on the left are in trouble, and if white plays circle, which is a natural response, you're damaging your own stones on the left.]

[ji]C[Does this stone deserve to live or die? How should I have defended against this stone?

N: You're wall here is a little weak at the triangles.  It's reasonable for white to try something in here and see if he can get points, either by living or reducing.]
;B[md]TR[nc][le]C[N: Again, don't attach to single stones you're trying to attack.  Either triangle is better.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[le]TR[ke][ld][md]C[N: The shape this forms is bad for black, since he's separated.  Remember this shape and don't play it in games.]
;B[mf];W[lf]C[N: Again.  If these stones die, it's moot, of course, but if they manage to survive you've lost.]
