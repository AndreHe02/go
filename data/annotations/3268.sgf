C[
Hello,

Thank you very much for reviewing my game. This game was a delicate balance between territory and influence in which I came out slightly behind. Pointers on judging the power/value of influence would be helpful. Also any tesuji or ideas about invading/reducing large moyos would be great.

Thanks very much.

-Dave Felcan];B[oq];W[dd];B[cp];W[pd];B[iq]C[David Felcan: I know this is a bit unconventional but I am simply trying new things.

Nothing wrong with that. It is natural to compare black's formation with the Chinses pattern (move P3 to Q4).]
;W[dk];B[pi]C[David Felcan: I went up to Q11 anticipating that I would be playing around Q6 after White came in to the corner and I didn't want to be overconcentrated.

Yes. 

Also, if white does play in the bottom right, Black R4 next is excellent.]
;W[qp];B[pn]C[I would prefer to play R6, since it makes it harder for white to find eye-space on the edge, but it is really a matter of personal preference.]

(;W[op]TR[pi][iq]C[This is a bad move by white. 

The Taisha is a long and complicated joseki, that spreads out over a large area. As it spreads out, the first things it will hit are the two marked black stones. Therefore, white is probably in trouble (but it would take a 9p to prove it).

As white I would play the variation.];B[pp]C[Good. Black does not need to fear complications with his reinforcements nearby.]
;W[po];B[pq]
(;W[qo]C[White should probably play the other way to keep things simple. (See variation.)]
;B[oo];W[on]TR[np]C[This is not (the normal) joseki. White normally pulls the stone out of atari. 

Of course, in this position, that would  be too dangerous.]
;B[no];W[pm]C[David Felcan: To be honest I forgot how to continue the Taisha from here so...

Well, it is not really the Taisha any more. (I think).

There is one really important move on the board, that you should play before doing anything else.]
;B[qf]TR[nn]C[OK, so this is a good move, defending your only weak stone before it can be attacked, but before doing anything else, you must atari at the marked point. That is so urgent.]
;W[md]TR[nn]C[And white must play at the marked point (it is sente, you would have to answer) before playing at the top.

White's 2-space jump at the top is unusual. However, it is not the sort of mistake you can aim to punish directly in the near future. Just ignore it for now, and the chances are that it will just turn out to be in the wrong place eventually, and white will end up wishing that he had played the normal move at O16.]

(;B[qm]TR[ql]C[This is a mistake by you. You would not like it if white answered at R8.

Also, you must play the atari at O6 first (see variation).]
;W[qn];B[ql];W[of]TR[qq]C[Very strange. The vital point is the 3-3 point in the bottom right corner. It is worth a lot of territory, and if white plays there, he gets two eyes for his group. If black plays there, white has a weak group between two strong black positions.]
;B[pg]C[So, of course, you should aslo play on the 3-3 point.]
;W[mm]C[David Felcan: I was not disatisfied with this result...

Yes. 

White should still play on the 3-3 point, not here.];B[qc]C[This is wrong. it is too early.

You end in gote, and in the proces of living in the corner, you help white to reduce the black territory on the side. 

If we compare this to white playing S16 (which is also gote), you have gained perhaps 15-20 points. That is not enough at this stage of the game.

I would play an approach to the top left corner.];W[qd];B[pc]
;W[oc];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[qe];B[rf];W[sf];B[ob];W[nc]
(;B[sd]C[This is bad. It just helps white to reduce you territory on the side.]
;W[se];B[rh]C[This is bad. 

This is just an endgame move. If you leave this move out, then white cannot threaten to kill you group on the side. Therefore this is just about territory (not life and death or influence). Therefore it is an endgame move. So save it for the endgame.

There are much bigger moves on the board now.];W[fp]TR[dn][fo]
[eq]C[There are several standard answers to white's two-space high approach.

I think that you play the wrong one. You should try to keep this one white stone separate from its friend on the left side, so that white has to defend it, so play either of the other two marked moves.]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[ep];W[fo];B[cm]TR[en]C[You still had a change to try to keep white separated. Try the marked move instead.]
;W[dn];B[bn];W[jp];B[ip]C[David Felcan: This attack went well for him. I thought I could split K4 and F4 groups, but it was I who came under attack

Yes, it is natural to want to split white here but you do have to be careful. The F4 group is now nearly connected to D10, so it is actually quite strong. Similarly, the whtie group in the bottom right is quite strong.

I think that this move is OK. The problem comes later.];W[mp]

(;B[np]TR[ip]C[This is not so good. 

Since white ignored your push, it is natural to want to hane at K5. However, I think that is too dangerous. Still, you should try to resist white's peep. See the variations.]
;W[mq]
(;B[mo]C[This is no good.

If you want to defend this group, you should play the 3-3 point and get space for two eyes.

However, it may by more important to defend J3 and J4.

This is a very difficult fight.];W[jo];B[kq];W[jq];B[io];W[jn]
;B[jr]C[This does not really work. What if white cuts now? see the variation.]

(;W[jl];B[er]C[M2 is better.];W[hn];B[fd]C[David Felcan: It seemed that white was working on central power, so I sought to counter with a high move

Seems reasonable.];W[hd];B[df];W[ee];B[cc];W[dc];B[cd]C[David Felcan: But this sequence was not consistent with that, though it did earn me profit.

Yes. It is at times like this that you really need to be able to estimate the score. Then you can decide whether the outcome will give you enough territory. Then you can make an informed decision.

Assuming that the sequence in the game happens in the top left:

Black territory:
Top right: 8
Right: 12
Bottom: 10 (white can probably play M4 in sente and reduce you to almost nothing.)
Bottom left: 18
Top left: 17

Total: 65.

White only really has his central moyo, which is very big, but will it add up to 65 points?

Hard to judge, but you could well reduce it to less than that, so what you do in the top left seems to be a reasonable plan.

(If you want to know how to do territory estimates like this, start with the book "The Endgame" from the Elementary Go Series (Chapter 1), then go on to "Positional Judgement" by Cho Chikun. Reasonably good score estimation can make a big difference in the number of games you win around the 1 dan level.)]
;W[ef];B[dg];W[eg];B[dh];W[ei];B[nh]C[David Felcan: White's center was large, but it was his only territory. I sought to reduce it as much as possible. This was probably too timid.

This is where you want a score estimate. You have around 65 points, so if you can limit white to under 60, you should win. Obviously, the more you trust the accuracy of your counting, the closer to the boarderline you can tread.

The other thing to think about is where is white weak around the edges of the moyo. Is any of the white position at the bottom thin? can you make white worry while reducing is moyo? (Very hard to tell, but if you get stronger in the middle generally, then something might happen.)

Indeed, what about the white group in the top right? Does an invasion at around L16 make white worry? (Probably not immidately, but after a move like this one in the centre, it might?)

Anyway, before playing this move is a good moment to review the whole board, and come up with a plan for winning.

On the whole, your move is in a good part or the board to be playing in. However, it is almost certainly too timid. I would go one space further.]
;W[lh]C[Notice that T13 is now sente, threatening to cappture 6 stones in a ladder, but there are probably bigger moves on the board.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[mh];W[ng]
(;B[kg]C[This move is quite dangerous. Your two stones will bu cut of in the middle of a ring of white ones. Are you sure they can live? Can you sacrifice them and still win (another need for accurate counting?)]
;W[kh];B[jc]C[Good. Better to be flexible and try make some live group in the white area, rather than insist of saving the two stones at L/M13.]
;W[jd];B[ic];W[id];B[hc];W[nb]

;W[kc];B[kb];W[mj]C[Compared to the previous count, white has lost a lot at the top, but gained in the lower centre.

White: Similar. It is a lot to count. Anway, you invasion seems to have gained quite a bit, and now you have sente.]
;B[og]C[Don't you want to play T13 first?];W[mi];B[dm];W[pk]
;B[qj]C[David Felcan: White's center is still very large. I thrashed about for ways to reduce.]
;W[di]C[David Felcan: I felt this was an error on white's part. he should have sealed the center.

I am not sure. White is threatening C15 now, isn't he? so this move is quite big, but then so is the centre. 

White should also be thinking about M4. Do you have a plan ready in case white plays there?]
;B[fm]C[Good. You are moving into the centre by threatening white's think position.

(But if white did play C15 now, how would you respond?)];W[fn]
;B[fl]C[This is very timid. At least play G8. But you should be aiming towards the threat of J6.]
;W[hl];B[fj]C[(Also consider the diagonal move at G9.)];W[fi]
;B[gj];W[gi];B[hj]C[David Felcan: This was good for black.

Yes. If you can handle both C15 and M4 without a major loss, then you must be ahead now, because you have gained a lot compared to the last count.]

I don't think so. Endgame moves in the center are normally smaller than they look. And if you estimate the value of these to moves, then you will see that that is true here.]

[mr][nr][or][as][bs][cs][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os]C[David Felcan: So white wins by 3.5 points. I presume I simply did not take seriously enough the possibilities inherent in the center, and should have taken steps to work more centerward earlier. The play in the top left corner comes to mind as somewhere I could have played differently.

(Acually it is only 2.5, since when you fill the dame, P9 is not territory.)

I disagree. I don't think that the centre was big enough to win the game. You could have won by playing a more careful endgame.

That is the second benefit of counting. The first is that by knowing the result of counting, the balance of territory, it is easier to plan your strategy.

Benefit two is that the process of counting all the territory on the board forced you to look carefully at each part of the board. And if you see an area where it is very hard to count, because whether white plays first or black plays first there makes a big difference, then you have just discovered a really big endgame move, which you should remember for later. This helps you play well in the endgame.

I mentioned two books on counting eariler ('The Endgame' and 'Positional Judgement'). There is also some reasonably good content on Senesi's library. http://senseis.xmp.net/?Counting

I would add that it is easiest to practice counting when watching other people's games. Also, it is best to count while your opponenet is thinking.

You did some good things in this game, like living at the top, and breaking in around F8. And you also did some silly things like invading the top right corner far too early, and not jumping far enough into the centre at move 77, and nearly dieing at the top. From your comments, you are clearly aware of some of the mistakes you are making, which is good. I think that you have the potential to get a lot stronger.]
