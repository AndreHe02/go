AB[pd][dp][pp]C[A: Hello! Thank you for reviewing my game. This is the first game I have put up for review and I look forward to learning ways to improve! I find often when playing at the 15k-10k level that my opponent comes out very aggressively in close fighting situations and when I respond or get sucked in to the fight I lose, whereas playing more conservatively elsewhere and building frameworks helps. This game is no exception. I would particularly appreciate suggestions on ways to improve my fighting in close quarters!

B: Hi, I''m Bart, around 7 kyu, and will try to review your game. My comments start with B:]
;W[dd];B[cf];W[gc];B[dj];W[nc];B[ld]LB[qc:A][pf:C][qf:B]C[A: I play the high pincer here with an eye towards building influence while giving White a stronger foothold in the corner. I feel a White move to A is a small price to pay.

B: the idea to build influence to the right side downwards is good. Just playing in that direction may be easier. E.g. B or C.]
;W[lc]LB[kd:A][md:B]C[A: White comes back and reaches to connect to the top left group - is this worth missing a move into the corner?

B: for white I think, yes. If you now play in the corner, white gets A or B and a big area on the left. See variations.]

(;B[nd]C[A: With this contact play begins a piece of fighting that I feel I do not win.]
;W[md];B[me]C[B: so far, normal play. Nothing wrong.];W[mc]

(;B[nf]LB[kd:A][od:C][le:B]C[B: this is a bit loose. If you're in close combat, keep your stones connected and strong. White now has A, B, and C atari's to choose from. If you play O15, white only has A or B. See variation.]
;W[od]C[B: yes, with O14 at O15, white doesnt have this move.]

(;B[oe];W[ne]
(;B[oc];W[nd]LB[pc:1][le:5][pe:2][mf:4][of:3]C[B: ouch, now you have 5 cutting points. White will get something out of it. Lets go one move back and see if you could have done some damage control. See variation for move 16.]

(;B[pf]C[B: again, I would choose to connect my stones. Give up the part you do not really want and get strong at the side you want. In this case, give up the corner and get strong on the right side down.]
;W[pc]
(;B[ob]C[B: usally, it's good to add a stone, but in this case you can force white to eat the single stone and build on your wall.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[le]
(;B[kd]LB[ld:A][me:B]C[B: again, usually good. But here you have to decide if it is worth fighting and if you can win the fight. This means: can you get out with your two stones (A), knowing white will be very strong after capturing B?
If the answer is, no, better not, than save stone B and give up A. See variation.]
;W[mf]
(;B[ng]LB[kd:A][cf:C][dj:B]C[B: with the previous move, you decided to fight. Don't get distracted by white and react there. Try to strengthen your A group or get them out towards friend B or C. See variation.]
;W[ke];B[jd];W[je];B[id];W[ie];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[ge];B[hf]
;W[cd]
(;B[ff]MA[ib][jb]C[A: After many slow moves Black is out for air and White claims the corner. Are the marked points better options for Black 40?

B: no, I think you can always play on of those in the endgame to reduce white. It's more important to get your group out. And playing F14 seems faster, but leaves a gap at G14. I'd prefer to play there myself.]
;W[ib]C[B: a slow move by white. And no need to connect, the left and right coners are alive.]
;B[kb]LB[df:D][gf:A][qj:B][jq:C]C[B: this was a good chance to take a big point. A connects your groups and keeps white in the corner. B gives you territory. C builds on the left or right and D gives you territory on the left.]
;W[kc]LB[lh:B][qk:C][jq:A]C[A: I quickly saw this become a wasted move. Looking at it now the better responses seem to me to be at A, B, or C, or even tengen.

B: good that you notice that yourself. See my previous comment.]
;B[jc];W[jb];B[lb]LB[jb:A][kb:C][ob:D][pb:E][nc:B]C[B: I think you're strong enough to count here. How many liberties for each group A-D?

B: A has 4, B has 3. C had 2 and now has 3. But it is white's turn after this, so if he plays at N18, C has 2 liberties. Against 4 (A) and 3 (B) black loses. So better to play one of your big moves elsewhere and save this as a ko threat.]

(;W[nb];B[ih]C[B: G14 connects your groups. Better to play there, I think.]
;W[qd]LB[qe:A]C[A: I learned here how precarious my group in that corner is. A play at A by Black should have happened much sooner. This leads to another sequence of fighting that I feel out of control of.]
;B[pe];W[rd]LB[oc:A][pc:B][qc:C][pd:E][qd:D]C[B: try to count here. Group A only has 1 liberty, so If you use group C to put pressure on B, white can ignore and later take A. And C had 2 liberties, against B and D both 3. 

B: so I think all you can do is some damage control: give the corner to white and strengthen your wall. See variation.]

(;B[rb];W[rf];B[qa];W[oa]
(;B[sd];W[re];B[rg]LB[re:A]C[B: group A has 4 liberties. The stone you just played has 3, and it's white turn.]
;W[qg]C[B: now 2.];B[pg];W[rh]C[B: now 1. I think the problem was move 56. There you can know that white will connect and get 4 liberties. Try to see that and do some damage control. Give white what he/she wants and try to get something out of it yourself. See variation at 56.]
;B[qh];W[sg];B[qi];W[ri];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[sc];B[jq]C[A: With this move I took the blinders off and stepped back to the way I like to play and out of the corner fighting. Could I have done so sooner?

B: yes, sort of. You needed to contain white into the corner first, that's urgent. See earlier comments and variations.]
;W[qk]
(;B[ql]C[B: there's an easy rule that says: don't atari the cutting stone. I think that's appropiate here.]
;W[pk]
(;B[pl];W[rl];B[rm];W[sk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[ph]C[A: I struggle with protecting my cutting points and still playing elsewhere on the board to create space. Working slowly on knowing when tennuki is appropriate and trying to gain a better understanding of sente.

B: yes, thats difficult. If you play a bit more solid you create less cutting points, so you can play elsewhere earlier; of course, it means giving the other a bit more points of territory here and there.]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[oi];W[pj]
(;B[oj]LB[nj:A][nl:B][qm:C]C[B: this is one example. You now have cutting point A and B. White may do something nasty later on using cutting point C as well.

B: if you play at A instead, you get 1 point of territory less, but also 1 cutting point less to worry about. See variation.]
;W[nl]C[A: Here White stays aggressive. A glance at board makes it look like Black has a large lead, but White's superior fighting skills whittle that lead down to a slim 17.5 at the end of the game.

B: yes, see previous comment.]
(;B[nm]C[B: and the comment about not giving atari to the cutting stone. See variation.]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[mm];B[nn];W[qm]C[B: yes, white is really using all the cutting points. This is C where I commented on earlier.]
;B[qn]C[B: but good that you saw it doesn't work for white.]

(;W[om];B[pm];W[on];B[oo];W[mn];B[no];W[mo];B[mp];W[lp];B[lq]
C[B: two cutting points again. Dangerous...]
(;W[kp]C[B:.. but white doesn't use it.];B[kq];W[jp]
(;B[lo]C[B: I think that's a bit early. See variation.];W[kn]
;B[ip];W[jo];B[io];W[in];B[go]LB[lh:C][jk:A][cm:E][dm:D][gn:B]
SQ[dj][dp]MA[ho]C[A: This move took me a while to decide upon. I felt as if I had sente and wanted to solidify some territory with it. Points A-E all drew my eye. This one seemed to lock off the safest points in the bottom left. Would a bigger move have been better? I feared White coming over at X.

B: A is a good point for reducing white, but should be played later on. B doesn't strengthen your area on the left, and doesn't put pressure on white (because white is alive). Point C is good to connect your groups, but I think you can connect of live there, so not urgent. Point D or E look ok. E is preferred, because the marked stones are both high (on the fourth line). Easier to invade by white after D.]

(;W[cn]C[B: ah, so your point E was spot on. White wanted to invade there.]

(;B[dn]TR[ml][nl][mm][cn][in][kn][mn][jo][mo][jp][kp][lp]C[A: At White 115 my biggest fear was a connection with the marked stones. Could I have played more aggressively to capture in the next sequence? Was that a valid concern?

B: no, I don't see white connecting. But what you played is already very aggressive. By attaching to the white stone you take away a liberty, but also one from your own stone. See variations.]
;W[co]
(;B[cp]C[B: this is inviting white to play D5. After that...]
;W[do];B[eo]LB[en:1][ep:2]C[B: ... you have 2 cutting points again. See variation for 118.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[ck];B[cj];W[bk];B[bj];W[bo];B[bp];W[dk];B[ek]
;W[em];B[fm];W[ao];B[ap]
(;W[bm]C[A: White 135 seems a bit unnecessary here until later on. Am i missing something?

B: no, I think you're right and white was already alive. But doing some variations, I see only ways for white to die, so maybe it was needed. Interesting tsumego.]

(;B[hn]LB[ik:C][hl:A][il:B][jn:2][ko:1]C[A: And in response is there a bigger option here? I hoped to pressure the center group and move up into the center. But it seems I could have moved up at A or B.

B: the center group is already alive (two eyes). So playing around B is better. Maybe C is even better.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[il];B[jj]LB[kh:B][hj:A]C[B: what is your aim here? If you want to make points on the left, better play A. Or if you want to connect your groups, play B.]
;W[kg]LB[hk:A]C[B: no need fot white te play there. It defends some points, but playing A for example gives you more trouble.]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[lh];W[mg];B[mh];W[if]C[B: white is helping you to build your territory.]
;B[ig];W[jg];B[hc];W[hb];B[ja]C[B: maybe you're aiming at cutting at A. But your stone has only 2 liberties, and if it connects with group B, it's still not enough.]

(;W[gf]C[B: so white tries to get into your territory.];B[hg]
LB[gg:A]C[A: A response at A seems more appropriate.

B: yes.];W[gg]
(;B[gh]LB[dh:A]C[B: beware of where you push white. Your points are in area A. You don't want to push white there.]
;W[fg];B[ef];W[eg];B[dg];W[dh];B[ch];W[fi]C[B: a bit too loose by white.]
;B[eh];W[fh];B[ei];W[gi];B[hi];W[gj];B[hk]LB[kk:A]C[A: Stops the connection.

B: true. I like to keep my opponents group disconnected as well. But in this situation, the top and the center groups are already alive, so it's not bad if they connect. And that gives you a move around A to make your group safe.]

(;W[jh];B[ji];W[hl];B[gl];W[ik];B[hj];W[jk];B[kk];W[kl];B[lk]
;W[ll]
(;B[ed]C[B: the idea is good. Playing the left side is probably easier.]
;W[de];B[df];W[ee];B[fe];W[ec]LB[fd:A]C[A: At the time I wondered why White did not play at A and take the stone and points.

B: me too.];B[fd]C[B: saving that stone is worth 2 points, and 2 points for white's territory that is reduced. Playing at A is worth a lot more (10 or 12). But that's endgame counting. I still have a lot to learn there as well :-)]
;W[fc];B[be]C[B: and you get to play it anyway. Good for you.]
;W[bd]
(;B[ae]C[B: A16 is possible.];W[ad];B[el];W[dl];B[gk];W[qq]
C[A: In the sequence following this invasion Black manages to hold on to much of his territory. Was there a response that would keep all of it?

 I'm aftraid not. The 3-3-invasion under the 4-4 (handicap) stone gives white a living group if there are no other black stones near.]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[qo];W[pr];B[or]
(;W[ps];B[os];W[rr];B[rp];W[rq];B[rs];W[ro];B[qr]C[B: nice snapback. White should have defended there.]
;W[rn]
(;B[sp]LB[sm:A][sn:B]C[A: Playing 212 at A or B seem like better options.]
;W[sm];B[qm];W[sn];B[sr];W[sl]

(;B[hq]C[B: see next comment.];W[gq];B[gr]LB[dq:1][fr:2][hr:3]
C[B: beware, cutting points. So move 224 was better placed at G3.]
;W[fr];B[hp];W[bg]C[This invasion gave me a bit of a heart attack and caused me to fill in a lot of points. I think the points I gained from White's dead stones justified it, but I feel that there was a more agile and controlled way to play.

B: if you keep your stones connected, there is no need to worry.]
;B[cg]C[B: good.]
(;W[bh];B[fj]LB[gb:B][ib:3][dc:A][fc:2][cd:1]C[A: Here I read that there was no more immediate danger and played with an eye to the cut at A and B. As you will see those cuts did not work. Was there a way they could have?

B: good, white cannot do anything there.
B: no, because when you play the cut, your cutting stone had 2 liberties. The white groups 1, 2, and 3 have 3 or more liberties, and white is to play next.]
;W[bi];B[aj];W[ci];B[di];W[bf];B[ce];W[ak];B[dc];W[cc];B[db]

I feel that had I allowed White to be aggressive after the small points and spent less time getting involved in local fights I may have improved upon this result. That and of course fighting locally with more skill. Thank you again for the review! I really appreciate the help and guidance and all of the great players out there that I have been able to learn from!

B: first of all, you did good. Some points to improve on and remember: try not to get too much cutting points, and try to count if it is worth fighting. Hope this review helps you.]
