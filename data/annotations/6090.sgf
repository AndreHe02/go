;B[pd];W[dc];B[qp];W[dp];B[fq];W[dn];B[kq]TR[qp][fq]C[A bit farther than usual, but I really don't think I should try to exploit this weakness now, for two reasons.
1. It's a bit too early
2. I have no idea how

This is the mini-chinese formation by black. The idea is to develop fast and invite white to jump in, and then attack the invasion to secure some real territory. You were right to not invade immediately.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb]
(;B[de]TR[kc][qc]C[I didn't expect this

Ignoring Q18 is perfectly normal and is seen a lot in professional games. There are two reasons.

The first is that the two marked points (R17 and L17) are miai for white (that is, white is sure to get at least one of them) to settle his group. That means that black can take one of them and force white to take the other. Since black doesn't know which will be more useful to him yet, it makes sense to leave the decision until later.

The second reason is to do with the high position of Q14. Using this stone effectively is quite hard. See the variation on the last move.]

Definitely.];B[cc]

;B[bg];W[bi];B[cf]
(;W[cl]C[This move feels a little overconcentrated and low on the left, especially with the 3-3 invasion still open.]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[Well, since L3 was a bit farther than usual, this seemed to be a good move, but C4 seemed alright. Might have been a bit passive though.

This move takes advantage of white's overconcentration. No result seems particularly good now.]
;B[dr]
(;W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[bo]C[This is also playable, because white can make use of his strength to reduce the black framework. White's low stones on the left look wasted, though.]

(;W[co];B[bn]C[I guess B6 would have been better than C5, I thought he would play B4, but I guess I was wrong.

You should leave the position after B5, and take either C5 or B6 once you know which is more useful. Both are fairly small for now.]
;W[bm]LB[dl:3][cm:1][dm:2]C[Small endgame move

You might need something to stop black cutting with 1-2-3, but even so, something like E8 is more active.]
;B[lc]
(;W[jc]C[Not good. See variation.];B[qc]
(;W[lb]C[White's shape with Q18 is awkward here. The exchange of Q18 for R17 removes your possibilities in the corner, but Q18 is too far away to be of any real use. Black misses a cut which would have been disastrous.]

(;B[kb];W[kc];B[mb];W[ld];B[mc];W[md];B[nb];W[oc]C[Black misses a chance here]

(;B[ob];W[pc];B[la];W[ne];B[qj]C[White seems far behind on points now. Both sides have around 25 points of solid territory, but that's not counting any of black's huge framework. White has a lot of thickness around the board, and needs to find a way to make use of it fast.]

(;W[qm]C[I was wondering about playing O3 or P3, but I thought I might leave that alone for later.]

(;B[pn]C[This is an ugly-looking move by black, but it's actually surprisingly effective. Shoulder hits like this are being tried by Korean professionals to solidify frameworks.]

(;W[pl];B[oj];W[nl];B[ok];W[ol];B[op]C[He made some excellent moves, strengthening the top right and the bottom right, plus my stones weren't very safe.

Yes. Your moves were a bit too heavy, so now the invasion is more of a burden than a profit.]

(;W[iq]C[Another  invasion that I'm questionable about.

F3 is so weak that this hardly deserves to be called an invasion. This just provokes black to defend, but there doesn't seem to be anything better.

You really ought to defend your weak group, but you're too far behind to be able to afford that. Since you have influence, you can maybe get away with leaving it floating. *Definitely* not something I'd usually recommend though.]

(;B[jo];W[ho];B[di]C[Ouch. This point whould have been white's.]
;W[dj];B[ej];W[dk];B[gf]TR[lj][jm]C[Black ought to keep up an attack on the floating white stones with a move at one of the marked points.]

(;W[mr]C[It seems that this wasn't the right way to invade... so what is?]
;B[or];W[kr];B[go]C[Black is trying too hard. A gentle attack on O8 is the surest way to keep the game under control and win.]
;W[hn];B[hp];W[ip];B[gn];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[fl];W[fk]C[Double hane, very useful]
;B[gk];W[hl];B[ek];W[fm];B[fj];W[em];B[hq];W[io];B[jr]C[Black uses what aji he has]
;W[ir];B[lr];W[jq];B[ks];W[kp];B[is];W[hr];B[hs];W[gr]C[Should be G1.]
;B[js]C[I have no idea why black plays this move.]
(;W[mp]C[See variation];B[lp];W[lo];B[lq];W[kn];B[mq];W[ph]
C[This might have been a bit too eager

Black's move at G5 has backfired spectacularly, giving you a lot of solid points, reducing his own moyo and (most importantly) getting O8 out of trouble. You played very well, and you're back in the game.

This is definitely the area to play. Now that O8 is safe, black looks very thin around here.]
;B[qh]
(;W[qe]C[I just wanted to see how he would answer

He answers by fixing a weakness. Unless you have a plan in mind, getting your opponent to fix a weakness is never good. You lose the chance to play R18 later, as well as removing a lot of aji.]

(;B[qd];W[pe]
(;B[od];W[oe]C[It was a tough desicion, but I decided to let him have my stones.

That's huge! You really have to kill the right side to make that worthwhile.]

(;W[gh];B[gi];W[hh];B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[if];B[mi]C[You've destroyed his territory in the centre, but he has also destroyed yours. I think black gets the better of this sequence.]

;W[ai]C[Misclick, my computer was lagging heavily and my mouse moved as I clicked. It was an obvious mistake, but my opponent was greedy and didn't let me have an undo. I believe if it hadn't been for this move, I would have won.

Unlucky. Some people don't like giving undos for any reason at all, which I suppose is their choice.]

I think it's a bit more complicated than that. See variations.]

(;B[ap]C[Black decided he'd answer this, then play F2

Very silly. Maybe black didn't see F2 either. The question is whether you can kill him if he plays F2 instead of this.]

;W[ao];B[ha]C[The endgame was all fine. 

You fell behind in the beginning because you took influence in exchange for territory and then failed to use it effectively to attack anything. It looked like you were a very long way behind, but influence is more powerful than it appears. If your invasion at R7 had been a bit more effective, it would have been much closer.

Black's failure around G5 put you back in the game, or even in the lead, but then giving up Q17 in the hope of killing something was too risky. A simple reduction would have done.

That's it - if you have any questions, please do email me or find me on KGS (i play as "ods")

Good luck!
