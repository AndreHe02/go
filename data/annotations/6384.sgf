AB[jd][dj]C[Hello Andrew, I'm Gregor, thank you for letting me review your game!]
;W[kj];B[dd];W[ik];B[gf]C[Gregor: b4 at g8 is too high. Better at g11, g10 or d7, c7. Another Possibility is l7.]
;W[kf];B[jf];W[fk]
(;B[ji]C[Gregor: instead b8 at l5 I'd prefere e3. See variant:]
;W[ki];B[ij];W[jk];B[jj]C[Gregor: b12 is not good. it makes an ampty triangl. the connection between k5 and j4 kannot be cut anyway, so k4 at this moment is useless.]
;W[kh];B[jg];W[kg]
(;B[ke]C[I was considering L3, L9 or K6.  I'm comfortable leaving k6 open for now.  If white plays K9 I feel weakened but L3 has a nice aggressive feel to it.  Looking back, I wonder if K6 wouldn't have been the better move?
Gregor: l3 is not good. I think, l3 cannot live. k6 would be overplay. l9 is best - big move.]
;W[lk]
(;B[el]C[Black 18.  Maybe G4, to shore up my wall?  maybe start to contain white in the lower board?  Or do I risk getting stuck in the center again?
Gregor: b18 is too low. better ply it at e3];W[fl];B[em]C[Gregor: b20 is too low. better play e3.]
;W[hj]
(;B[hi]C[Black 22.  darn, white 22 on H4 scares me.  Would H3 have been a better response?
Gregor: I'm not sure. Perhaps h3 is more aggressive. but I'd prefere to play at greater distance or to connect at k6. In the center there is less territory to gain. see variant.]
;W[hk];B[gj];W[gi];B[fj]C[Black 26.  i want to prevent further incursion to the center. Im concerned about losing H5 or G4.

Gregor: the situation in te lower part seems complicated. there are still big points to play - c or d7, g11 or g10. to loose one point h5 or g4 is not so important.]
;W[hh];B[ih];W[ii];B[jh];W[eh]
(;B[hi]C[Black 32.  maybe that was myopic?  Heat of the moment.
Gregor: very little to win (or loose) here, big points sould be playd first. see vairant.]
;W[gg]
(;B[fi]C[Gregor: b34 is too small. and w ignores it! th w group must fioght for living. w  will try to reach the side of the bord and connect ist group - b should try to prefent this.
I'll try some variants.];W[fg];B[gh];W[ch]C[Gregor: now w has taken the big point c6!]

(;B[hg]C[Black 38.  I'm losing all that territory.  starting to panic a bit.
Gregor: better defent the lower left corner - ther is territory to defend!]
;W[cf];B[kc]C[black 40.  Ok I want to decide where my turf is going to be. top of the board should be mine, no?
Gregor: w has possibilities to invade. I'd prefere to defent the left corner with c9, but l11 is ok i think.]
;W[ff];B[ge];W[bj]C[Gregor: now w gets the lower left corner, if b does not defend. see vairant:]

(;B[ce];W[df];B[ck]C[Black 46.  or do I break  at E8?  or build a stronger corner in the lower left?
Gregor: c3 is essential!];W[ed]
(;B[ee]C[Gregor: a difficult situation! I'd rather playes above, at e11 or d11. I'll try some variants.]
;W[de];B[fe];W[ec];B[eb];W[dc];B[cd];W[gc];B[cc]C[Black 56 - the computer edit on replay shows that I still have a chunk of territory that this move brought - including capture of 3 white stones on D11.  i didn't see that, and don't know how I could have strengthened that position.]
;W[db]
(;B[fd]C[Gregor: b58 at f10 is not good- does not accomplish anything. better try to live in the corner. But i'm not sure, if it is possible. Look!]
;W[fc];B[da];W[ca];B[cb];W[ea];B[bb];W[be]
(;B[ef]C[black 66 does white 65 prevent me from getting life?

That was my note taken during play.  On review, it appears as if that move is when White started to really take dominance on the board.

Gregor: I think, the black group in the left upper corner is already dead. But I'll try to dedfend:]
;W[eg]C[Gregor: More to gain in the upper right corner! Look!]

(;B[fh];W[ba];B[hc];W[le];B[ld];W[hb];B[ib]C[Gregor: better play at j11.]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[jb]
(;B[ia]C[Gregor: no use, b at h12 isw lost. better defend corner. look!]
;W[ja];B[kb];W[lf];B[jc];W[ha];B[id]C[Gregor: E3 is bigger!]
;W[ek]C[Gregor: I'd try at d3. Look!]
(;B[ej];W[dl];B[dk];W[fm];B[cl];W[dm];B[cm];W[ka];B[lc];W[ib]
;B[lb]C[Gregor: b96 better at m13.];W[gk];B[la];W[md];B[mc]
;W[me]
(;B[gd]C[102 looks like a wasted move (one of many, I know)
Gregor: yes. 102 better at c3 - look!];W[di];B[ei];W[cj];B[bk]

;W[bg];B[ad];W[ag];B[af];W[ab];B[ac]C[Gregor: instead of pass i'd play a13. Look!]

(;W[gb]
(;B[tt];W[tt]C[Resumee:
I think you should play the big points at the sides  first, then concentrate at defending the corners and think of expanding to the center as the third step. Try not to make it too komplicated.

Thank you for letting me review your game!])
