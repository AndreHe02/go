C[Hi. I played white and lost this game by 10 points. Both sides played steady. There were no big mistakes, but I can't figure out where I could have played better. Obviously I could have. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks

Julian: Hi Tim, I'll be reviewing your game.  I've put my comments below any questions and they should all look like this one.  I have attempted as much as possible to only comment where I can give solid reasons for my thoughts, but my desire to be helpful exceeds my knowledge, so you should take anything I say with a grain of salt!  Feel free to email me at jandrews271@gmail.com if you have any questions about the review.]

(;W[ep]MA[jd]LB[ec:A][fc:B][lc:D][cj:C]C[Julian: W's play here seems geared towards limiting the scope of B's not-even-made-yet moyo.  If W doesn't plan to build territory somewhere, he's never going to have much of it!

The approach move at (A) is sente for B and simultaneously an ideal extension from the marked stone.  On the flip side, a shimari at (A) (or at (B)) is a large move for W with an even bigger follow up around (C).

Perhaps more importantly, B has a weakness at (D) which the play at (A) helps him to shore up.  It is important when your opponent plays moves like the marked stone to keep track of the weaknesses they leave and try to find ways to make him pay for them.

I looked over a number of professional games with this basic pattern, and when W plays R14, B invariably makes an approach move against the upper right immediately instead of the marked play.  Making the shimari here lets W naturally develop his territory while keeping B off balance.]

Julian: Definitely.  Having to answer H3 passively is very painful for W here.]
;B[hq]
(;W[fr];B[dk]
(;W[kq]MA[hq]C[Julian: This move is questionable.  W should not expect to get very much territory here - it will take at least 2 more moves to unequivocally capture the marked stone.  

W's group may not be totally settled, but it is very difficult to attack.  He doesn't need to play here to defend his group.]
;B[mq];W[jp]MA[kq]LB[ho:A]C[Julian: Since B can still play at (A), splitting W, this move does little for W.  That said, the problem was in playing the marked stone to start with!]
;B[pb]
(;W[qc]LB[qi:A]C[Julian: This is undeniably a big move.  However, given B's formation at the bottom, you might consider a play at (A) instead. The corner isn't of much strategic importance beyond the handful of points it's worth, and an extension up the right side is big for both players.]
;B[pj];W[po]LB[qo:A]C[Julian: Good!  This is necessary now  (A might also be worth considering).]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[qp]
(;W[pn]C[Julian: This move is very heavy.];B[qh]LB[qb:A]C[Julian: This move threatens to remove W's base by playing at (A).  W should play there himself to settle his group securely now.]

[bd][be]TR[qq][rq][sq][pr][ps][qr][qs][rr][rs][sr][ss]C[@@@Taking stock@@@

Julian:   At this point, I would say that the game is very hard for W.   He has maybe 10 solid points in the upper left, at most a handful from his two right side groups, and only a handful at the bottom unless he captures the stone at H3.

B, on the other hand, has a 11 solid points in the lower right, potential for a number more on the left side, and while his top group is still open to invasion, B can count on coming out ahead there by 15 points or more no matter what W does.  So B can count on 25+ solid points to W's 10, and B's influence is stronger.

W is going to need to get almost all of his potential points if he hopes to win.  The game remains interesting, and I'll continue my reivew, but I would say that from here on W's is gaining ground and that the big mistakes have already happened!]
;W[og];B[mj]
(;W[mo]MA[mq]LB[nq:A]C[Julian: In one common joseki the marked stone would be at (A).  You should be looking to take advantage of B's awkward shape.]

;W[mg];B[no];W[nn];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln];W[nm];B[lo]
(;W[ll]MA[jd][dk]LB[kj:A]C[Julian: This move is very slow.

It takes no territory, and doesn't even threaten to take any eventually.

It moves out into the center, but W has no easy group to run towards, and besides, can live on the side if he needs to.

It puts some pressure on B's floating group, but B can easily escape to A.  W needs to attack this group more aggresively and turn it's weakness into a wall to counter the influence of the marked stones.]
;B[nh];W[ng];B[ki]SQ[mo]

(;W[rj]C[connecting here made me feel both groups were safe, but it feels slow

-----------------------------
Julian: Deciding whether to play a move like this is basically a reading problem.  In terms of points it is worth very little, so if both W groups could live if he tenukis, he certainly should.  It's worth taking the time here to read out the attacks B can mount to decide if a move like this is truly necessary.

In this case, I think W's groups definitely needed reinforcement, but there's a better move!]
;B[ri];W[si];B[qi];W[rg];B[ch];W[jn]MA[ch]C[Julian: Now W plays this move anyway!  The exchange of the connection for the marked stone was a clear loss!

------------------------------
Julian: This was a fun game to review.  I hope It will be as helpful for you as it was for me!

In this game you did a good job of reducing your opponents territory, but made little effort to make your own.  As a result, you ended up with very little territory towards the early midgame.  Your largest territory (around the H3 stone materialized very late in the game, and it was lucky B doesn't have your eye for reduction!

You seem to have a good sense for local good play, but could benefit from making a more conscious effort to create territories - especially in the early game.  You need to be thinking about where the lines between the territories might be drawn.  When you read out a sequence, do a rought count of the teritories that will result, and if you don't have the advantage, make sure you have some serious compensation in influence before you play it!]

Obviously there are many other sequences to look at.  A good exercise would be to try to read through all of B's attacks against W.

The game is still hard for W, but he has a chance.]))

(;B[rd]SQ[qb][qh]C[Julian: This is a good move to remember for this shape.  With the two squared stones, B can deprive W of his base.
