C[Dear reviewer,
First of all: thanks a lot for taking the trouble to review my game!
The reason I submitted this game to GTL is that I have been losing a lot to slightly stronger players lately. From the opening on, I feel a pressure and am unable to play freely. This results in a cramped game, which I then proceed to lose by a blunder.
You'll see :)
At some moves I have added a question. But not much, since I have the feeling that I am missing something big and I do not want to distract you from finding out what it is.
Also, there might be a psychological side to this loss (like getting flustered too easily) on which you might care to comment.
Thanks again!

;B[ep]C[Please tell me how you think about the timing of this move and the previous one (j)

klin: This move may increase white's influnce to the left and make D11 move look good.]
;W[eo];B[eq];W[gp];B[dq];W[cq]C[klin: W C3 can play at C4, C3, then B3. The corner will be smaller for B. Later, G2 is a sente for W.]
;B[cp];W[do];B[bq];W[cr];B[br];W[bp];B[co];W[cn];B[bo];W[bn]
;B[ap];W[fd]C[klin: B gets a big corner, but the price is W gets to play at F16.]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[bb];B[cg];W[bh]TR[ep]C[All this I saw coming when I played the marked stone (E4). But what is your judgment? (j)

klin: This is the price you pay for getting the corner.];B[eg]
;W[fh]TR[di][bh]C[Together with the marked stones this seems to be bad shape. So I wasted a lot of energy looking for aji here (j)

klin: Since w is strong here, the aji is not serious.];B[fg]
;W[gg]C[klin: W G13 too agreesive. G12 good enough.];B[gf];W[gh]
;B[hf];W[hd];B[ih]C[Is extending straight out better, perhaps? (j)

klin: A little bit rsiky here.];W[jd];B[lc];W[jc]C[klin: W K17 slow. L15 is the place to play.]
;B[kf]C[From here I got into trouble amazingly fast. Still don't quite get why (j)

klin: Bad shape, that's why. K14 better.];W[qj];B[ql]C[wrong side? (j)

klin: No.  This is actually better than R12];W[qg];B[qe];W[oj]
;B[ol]LB[le:a]C[Better at a? (j)

klin: B can play Q11 before P8. "a" is also playable.];W[ld]
;B[md]C[klin:  With left group weak, N16 should play at N17]
;W[le];B[mc];W[ij]C[Suddenly I am feeling chilly (j)];B[il]
C[This move I doubt very much (j)

klin: B is too greedy.];W[ji];B[hi]C[klin: Before this move, B should C11 first]
;W[gj]C[Would you please help me analyze the mess that now follows? (j)]
;B[hj];W[hk];B[ik];W[ig]C[klin: Still can play at C11 now.]
(;B[ii];W[if];B[hg];W[hh];B[ge]C[A panic move. The result in the game is better than I probably deserved. (j)

klin: Ugly move and serve no purpose.];W[he];B[ed];W[fc];B[fe]
;W[jj];B[jh];W[gk];B[mf];W[kl]C[klin: Now B J5 looking like a gift.]
;B[je]LB[lf:a]C[A misread, should be at a? (j)

klin: Yes.];W[ie];B[kd];W[kh]C[Ouch. But B has some aji here and there (j)]
;B[gd];W[gc];B[hc];W[id];B[ec];W[eb];B[hb];W[gb];B[dn];W[fn]
;B[dm];W[cl];B[ci]C[klin: Too late now.];W[ch];B[dh];W[gi]C[klin: W G11 can play at D10.]
;B[dj];W[ei];B[cj];W[bg];B[cf];W[dl]C[I believed that I had caught up, taking all these juicy points in sente (j)

klin: B has gained.  It was W G11's doing.];B[kp];W[rp]LB[oo:a]
C[Here I was in byo-yomi. Disaster follows quickly. Still I'd like to know how B should have played here, and who is ahead. And, would a not have been better for White? (j)

klin: It is an even game now.  B is not bad.];B[ro];W[qo];B[rn]
C[Wanting "something more" and obtaining absolutely nothing (j)

klin: This move is OK most of the time if you know how to proceed.]
;W[pp];B[qq];W[pq];B[po]C[klin: This is a bad move.  Should simply R2. Do not think you can kill the w group.]
;W[qr];B[rq];W[op];B[nq];W[np];B[mq];W[mp];B[lp];W[nm];B[nl]
;W[mm];B[or];W[pr];B[nj];W[rf];B[re];W[oi];B[rk]C[klin: Last chance to play K3]
;W[kr]C[klin: B is in trouble now.];B[jr];W[jq];B[kq];W[ir]
;B[lr];W[js];B[lm]C[klin: If w plays at M6, B is in a bigger trouble.]
;W[ll];B[km];W[ml];B[mn];W[nn];B[mo]C[klin: At least the B group is alive.

No more comment beyond this point.];W[jm];B[jn];W[in];B[ko]
;W[ln];B[kn];W[no]C[Black resigns (j)])
(;B[jg]C[better? (j)]))
