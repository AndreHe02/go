C[Hi there!
This is Biondy. I'm 2k in KGS and reviewer for your game.
Enjoy!];B[qp];W[cc];B[dq];W[pd];B[cn];W[op]C[I think maybe I should have played at k3 instead.  I should be expecting a play around m3 or so, since it is an extension and an attack.

B: Yes. I Prefer K3. A pincer in this situation will be perfect for black.

B: A pincer at M3 is not a good option for black. See variation]

(;B[mp];W[on];B[jp]C[This isn't joseki (is it?).  It seems wrong to me (playing toward strength?).  Should I be happy with the inefficiency?

B: yes. this is not a good answer.];W[jd];B[cj]C[B: An extension at here is not the best point for black.
Black should play R6 at this point.]
(;W[df]TR[qp]C[B:Instead of this, you could gain some initiative by attacking black's lonely stone by attaching at R3. See var.]
;B[gp]
(;W[pj]C[Should I even extend here? I was thinking that something like r6, but was worried about the p4 stone getting cut off.  Should I have been?

B:You should play R3 first.];B[cg];W[cf]C[B: I think the direction is not right. perhaps D13 will give black less wall here.]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[nq];W[oq];B[qr];W[cq]TR[ej][en][fh]C[This didn't seem like the right thing to do, but I thought he might let me live here.

B: The invasion looks too fast. Playing aroun marked point would be safier here.]
;B[cp];W[eo]TR[dr]C[Just wanted to reduce the area.  Maybe should have played r16 or r6, but sooner or later b will play p6, and start building a big big framework.

B: you can try playing double hane first to make a threat that may come to be handy for you.]
;B[ep];W[fn]TR[em]C[B: this looks slow for me. An iken tobi perhaps will be beter here]
;B[jj];W[dk];B[ck];W[dl];B[cl];W[gk]TR[dk][dl]C[this seems too close, or in the wrong place to me.

B: no. it looks ok for me. the combination was very good];B[fh]
;W[gg]TR[dk][dl][eo][fn][gk]C[Pushing b into my weak group.  Not so sharp.

B: yes. you're playing with fire here as the marked group is not yet settled]
;B[gi];W[hn];B[jn];W[il];B[jl];W[im];B[jm];W[dm];B[cm];W[do]
;B[co];W[dp]C[worthless move.  I know.

B: yes. it took away one of your ko threat.];B[eq];W[fo];B[fp]

;W[pr];B[nr];W[rn];B[rp];W[ps];B[sr];W[so];B[sp];W[sn];B[rq]
C[B: black waste a move here. the group is already alive. no need to play here.]

(;W[mm]C[B: this move is not good. I think enclosing your corner is bigger than this.]
;B[gc];W[ec];B[ic];W[jc];B[fd]
(;W[ed]LB[he:A]C[B: perhaps a keima at A is better here];B[id]
;W[ie];B[he];W[if]C[Double hane?  I thought it would be greedy.  I thought I had more than enough to win at this point.  I feel like I am very far ahead.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[jb];W[kb];B[ib];W[lc];B[fc];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb]
TR[qe][pf]C[B: it's better to skip the exchange. around marked is bigger]

B: you actually miss a simple tesuji in the progress.]

(;W[hh]C[B: this move is troublesome. J13 is the correct answer here. see variation.]

C[B: I don't see any harm that make you need to defend here.]
;B[tt];W[tt]C[B: overall, you are playing very good. 

you need to work on more tsumego (life & death). you miss simple tsumegos, like the one in the upper right corner or to save your captured group during yose. I suggest you to read Cho Chikun's Encyclopedia of Life&Death. A very good tsumego book.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or if you find any error in my comment (I don't say that I know everything).

Have a nice day.
