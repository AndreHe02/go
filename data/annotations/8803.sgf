--- Hello, I will be reviewing your game.

In this game, you got early advantage due to white's mistakes to create two weak groups. 

However, white eventually won because of some of your late-game mistakes. Mainly, due to the failed invasion on the lower-left corner that causes the whole left side to become white's territory. In the endgame, your opponent also did better and got more big points than you.

I think your general sense of direction is OK. You should refrain from invasion that causes outright lose of points. 

To improve your game, you should do a lot of life-and-death problems. One other area you can improve is endgame. "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" has a short section on endgame. For your rank, the information from this book should be enough

The more serious study on endgame would be "The Endgame" book by Tomoko Ogawa. There is "200 Endgame Problems" books that have a lot of endgame tesuji.

C[--- In the opening, it is more common to play in the largest open area. This white move unnecessarily put himself in the strong black area.

Splitting black area with A is more common.];B[pf];W[pb]LB[kc:A]
C[--- Playing at A is better for white.];B[lc];W[qc];B[oc];W[ob]

;W[nb]C[--- Now you got an excellent wall from white's mistakes.]
;B[iq]
(;W[qi]LB[qk:A]C[--- This is playing too close to the strong stones for white.

Playing at A to split the area and have room to extend 2-space on either side is much better. See variation.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[oj]C[--- This is a good move.

In the early fighting, you should think about being the first one to reach the center.]
;W[rk];B[ql];W[qg];B[qf];W[rl];B[rm]C[--- Usually extending at R7 is more solid. The move in the game leaves the cut at R7.

The 2-stone chain is usually quite weak. You should be cautious about them.]

White should play from his two weak groups instead to avoid being attacked.]
;B[sd];W[rd];B[sc];W[rb]C[--- Now you have sente. White has two weak groups floating.

You can attck either group and gain a lot of profit.]

(;B[mn]C[--- When attacking, I notice that, a lot of times, you play inside the enemy's area and chase him out.

In many cases, it is more profitable to try to attack the enemy from outside. Either try to enclose him or create territory naturally with your attacking stones.

See variation.];W[lo];B[lp];W[lj];B[cn];W[hf];B[ke];W[fq];B[en]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq]TR[cn][en]C[--- Again, you play inside enemy's area.

Even if you live, white will get strong outside in the process. The marked black stones are not strong yet. They will be attacked to create white territory on the left. So, your play at C3 will gain you nothing.

It is beter to try to create territory. Later, if your outside is strong, you can attack this white group.

See variation.];W[cp];B[eq];W[ep];B[dq];W[gp];B[fr];W[gr];B[es]
;W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[gs];W[hs]C[--- White H2 is correct.];B[hr]
C[--- This is white's mistake to allow you to get a ko. He should play H2 instead of H1.]
;W[fs]
(;B[is]C[--- This is a bad move. You should play a ko threat, such as J11, Q12, G13, M18, etc.]
;W[er];B[gs];W[fr]TR[cn][en]C[--- Now your invasion costs you a lot of points. White gains a lot of points in the corner and make himself strong in the process!

Your marked stones feel lonely now against the strong white wall.]
(;B[fo]C[---- White is not in danger, even if you cut at F4.

Black should play somewhere else. See variation.];W[go];B[gn]
;W[hn];B[gm];W[ci]C[--- White plays the big move. 

Now it is difficult game for black.];B[qa]C[--- Another placement inside enemy's area.

This move loses points. So, unless you have read ahead that you can kill white, you should not play here.

M18 instead force white to live and gain points in sente.];W[ra]

;B[jo];W[eo]LB[gb:A][ae:B][gj:C][km:D]C[--- Now the endgame begins. 

There are a few big plays around the edges at A and B.

You can get quite a few points by closing the center at C, and to the lesser extent, D.

In the endgame, you should look for the big plays around the edges first. They are usually bigger than you realize.]
;B[fn]C[--- Small. G18 is bigger.];W[gb]C[--- White gets the biggest point on the board.]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ie];W[ge];B[km]C[--- You get one big point (though G10 is bigger).]
;W[lm];B[kn];W[ko];B[kp]C[--- Connect at L8 is bigger.];W[kl]
;B[jl];W[gk]C[--- White now gets the 2nd big point. This is bigger than your L7 earlier.]
;B[gj]C[--- Black G10 makes white strong and lead to the capture of two stones later.

You should play G8 instead.];W[hj];B[fj];W[hl];B[hm];W[jm];B[im]
;W[jn];B[in];W[fk];B[ek];W[di];B[dh]C[--- A15 is bigger.];W[ae]
C[--- Now white gets another big points. White has a better endgame than you in this game.

The review ends here. I would like to give you a few pointers based on this game:

1) In the early game, it is usually better to seal opponent from the outside and let him lives small. There are many exceptions to this. However, thinking this way could be your starting point.

2) Also, in attacking, try to think about sealing opponent or at least playing from outside first. Sometimes, you may need to play inside opponent's area to destroy his eye. However, this is not always the case.

3) Sente is very valuable in all stages of the game, openning, middlegame, endgame. You should try to obtain it if there is a chance. There is no need to always follow the opponent around and answer his every move. Try to look for sente to play the big moves.

4) In the endgame, looks for big moves around the edges. They are usually bigger than moves in the center. Try to play as many big points as possible.]
