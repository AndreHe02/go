C[Hello Oceandrop,

I'm happy to have been able to make this review for you. I looked at the invasions black made and I think you are underestimationg your talents ^^ Just do some reading exercises and before you know it your confidence will be skyrocketing in tight situations.

I commented on some of the points I thought were more important. Of course I'm only a 3k on KGS so don't accept everything I say. Just try and understand the message I want to give and then judge the situation again for yourself.

greetings and keep enjoying go ^^];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pj]

;B[qg];W[kc];B[mq];W[pb]TR[mq]C[GDK: by not replying to N 3 you will have to treat the group on the bottom right lightly, sacrificing then maybe in the later part of the game or using them as reduction stones. You will just have to be carefull not to have another weak group.]

;B[hc];W[gc]C[OD: False response? Maybe better H15? I have to get better, such moves like J2, H17 I'm not accustomed but they seem right to do if the opponnent can't play well enough to defend his groups right (Like me?) He later also played something by C5 or in this area... :-/ maybe you could make general comments about how to defend better or react better to such plays?

GDK: 'Well the truth is... practice! ^^  You have to play some games but if you do some life and death problems, you will be able to read out the sequences and figure out what works best.Otherwise I think G17 isn't bad an neither was J3  in that situation. ']

;B[ie];W[kh];B[ea];W[db]C[OD: he was much better then me :-( and maybe L12 was not the best? Was this good for black? Or could I just not punish him right? What about such plays, are they good so aggressive? I never met someone like him, but I guess this is because I played against other 8k's who do not play right and should be at a lower rank like me? Maybe I do not play like a 8k?

GDK: 'L12 doesn't work so finding another move would be better. It's good  to put pressure on the other player but don't sacrifice too much. In this last sequence you let your group be cut off because you were chasing the black group at the top  really hard']
