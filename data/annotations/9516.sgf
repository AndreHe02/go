FM: hello, my name is Martin and I will begin my comments with "FM:" as my nick nearly everywhere is Field Mouse]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dc];B[de];W[ce];B[cf];W[cd];B[fq]LB[df:B]
[dg:A][cn:C]C[FM: this move is very popular these days to avoid the classical results after A or B. Playing at C was also possible. White has a large variety of choices now and it is easy to fall into trap. The sourc of variations I added here is a very nice book book "A dictionary of modern fuseki: The Korean Style".]

(;W[cn]C[I was not sure if this is ok after Black played C9 (after this) that made White C6 was inefficient when split Black at C12. But I didn't like to made a pincer in this situation.

FM: white has many possibilities to play here and this is one of the playable variations]
;B[dg];W[fc];B[ck]C[At this point, I thought if White was at C7 instead of C6 was better.


FM: yes, this was the goal of the F3 move. Still the position is even here.]

(;W[hq]LB[eq:C][hq:A][dr:B]C[I was worried about the corner but to protect it at D2 or kick at E2 and then pincer it were both inefficient (I think).]

(;W[co]C[FM: this is not joseki];B[bp];W[er]TR[co]C[White was overconcentrate and gote :(
Is there any other better way?


FM: yes, the marked move was a mistake];B[nq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg]
;B[qe];W[nc];B[pb];W[kd];B[ic]
(;W[hd]LB[jc:B][hd:A]TR[ch][lq]C[Is this too aggressive? I thought of 2 options. Please see the variation.


FM: it is quite hard for white to play in this area. Generally white would like to gather some strenght here to be able to aim at the marked points better and this move is a good choice]

(;B[ec];W[db];B[eb];W[ca];B[fd];W[gc]C[FM: the result is quite even after all]

(;B[pg]C[FM: bad direction of play. Everything on the upper side is super strong so building a wall in there does not make much sense. Also driving white to the lower right corner where black would like to create some points is bad too.]
;W[pj]C[FM: forcing white to go here to hurt the lower left corner is painful for black]
;B[oi]
(;W[pf]C[FM: this is aji keshi];B[qf];W[ph];B[og];W[oh];B[nh]
;W[qh];B[ni];W[ng];B[of];W[oe]
(;B[pe]C[FM: noooo :-)];W[nf];B[pf];W[pl];B[qm]C[FM: black is happy to protect the territory]
;W[nk]LB[ch:A][lq:B]C[I think Black was ahead. At here, I think the big and urgent move for White is M3 that will increase White's territories and decrease Black's. It's because White was lack of territories. Am I right?

I planned to attack the Black group while building a wall from the O9 group before playing at M3. But I didn't play this. Is my idea ok?

FM: I think white is okay on territory. There are still some aji around A so the territory on the left side can be reduced easily. Also after white plays B there will be some aji in the lower right. All white has to do is to be careful about the right group and get to play B - the rest depends on what will black play]

(;W[gg]C[FM: this move is good only when it is possible to kill the black stones]
;B[ij]LB[gf:A]C[FM: because white can be cut around A the fight is quite fair as white must be careful here too. With this white is losing the advantage in the fight]

FM: just A would be much simplier. White does not need to fight anymore in this game as white is winning on territory]

(;W[kn];B[ir]LB[pp:B][pq:A];W[mq]C[I think White can do better?


FM: this move does not do much but the position was not very favorable for white even before this move]

No more questions after this.


FM: thanks for attention. I do not think there were any big mistakes in the direction of play in this game. Most of them were technical - the A stone in the lower left and then the ko on the upper side would be interesting not to connect so early. The biggest loss that almost costed white the game was on the lower side, where simply protecting would be enough. I hope my comments will help, especially the fuseki thing that everybody plays nowadays helped me a lot when I first learned it :-)]
