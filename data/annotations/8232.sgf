AB[pd][dp]C[Hello! My name is Kim, and I will be reviewing this game for gpaul.

To read this review, follow the original game path and check variations when prompted.]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[fc];B[fd]C[Attaching on top after a low approach seems to be a theme of this game.  You do it in every corner in which you have a star point in this game.

This is a move that works best for building influence when you have a nice moyo to work with.  Here it is not a bad idea since you do have the bottom left star point.  While I wouldn't really call that a moyo, it is at least a stone of your color in the right area, so influence towards the bottom of the board should serve you well.

In the other corners, it is not as good of an idea.  But, we can look at those when we get there.]
;W[dc]C[This move by white not a standard response.  You handle it fine though.]
;B[cc];W[ed];B[ee];W[ec];B[cd]LB[de:A]TR[fe]C[It would be better to play at A here.  Then you wouldn't have to worry as much about the eventual cut at F15.]
;W[de];B[df];W[fe];B[ce]LB[ef:A]C[Playing at A here instead of capturing would be slightly better since you wouldn't have to worry about white playing atari at A later.]
;W[gd];B[dj];W[nc];B[nd]LB[pf:B][qf:A]TR[md]C[Here is that attachment again.  This time white has the bottom star point, and you do not have any other stones to work with.  That means that you will have nothing to support whatever you build here.

Another thing to consider is what happens here if white plays the hane at N17.  I'll show one standard joseki variation that works particuarly well for white to give you the idea.  (See variation.)

I would suggest a move at A or B instead.  That way you're making a bit of a base to work with rather than a wall floating in the middle of nowhere.]
(;W[pb]C[This is another non-standard response from white, and there is a great opportunity here for black...]
(;B[pc]LB[mc:A][qc:B]TR[md]C[This move is a bit silly.  It does not do anything to keep white from getting into the corner, it doesn't build any territory for black, and it does not keep all of white's stones at the top of the board from working together.

My first choice here for black is definitely the hane at A because it does the opposite of what a hane at N16 would have done for white. (See first variation.)

While it is nowhere near as nice as A, B also desevers some mention.  If you're looking for a move that would keep white out of the corner, B does it much more cleanly than the move from the game.  After B, if white continues to push into the corner, there's no threat to black.  (See second variation.)]
;W[qb];B[oc]C[This move is somewhat silly too.  The threat of a cut isn't huge, and it gives black an akward shape.]
;W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[qd];W[rc];B[qf]C[Whenever you catch stones in a ladder, make a mental note to watch for ladder breakers.  Given that the oposite corner from this one is still unplayed, there is a particuarly big risk of one coming up.]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[ob];B[mc]C[It's good that you do eventually get this move.  Keeping white confined the the corner is good.]
;W[jc];B[pj];W[jp];B[hq];W[jj]C[Here's the first ladder breaker.]
;B[lj]C[Good job coming up with a move that keeps the stones caught in the ladder while building your moyo!]
;W[lh]C[Here's the move that catches you.];B[ki]C[It's really tempting to cut the elephant move like this, but as you see in the game, it lets white escape the ladder.]
;W[pf];B[qg];W[rf];B[og];W[ke];B[of]C[Since your stones are unsavable, this is a bit small.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dn]LB[cl:A][cp:B]C[Here we have another attachment on top.

This time, a pincer at A would be a much better choice.  It works beautifully with D10 to make some territory, and it puts preasure on the white stone.  (See variation.)

B is also a possibility if you want to keep the corner and let white have a living group outside it.  But, trapping white in the corner seems much better.]
;W[cm];B[se]LB[co:A]C[This is small at this point in the game.  White is already trapped in there, so all you're doing is bringing one stone back to life and killing a handful of white stones.  That is worth some points, but it doesn't help your position.  So, it would be better to leave it for end game.  I know completely making up for that missed ladder breaker feels good.  But, your opponent is only giving those stones back up because there are bigger moves on the board.

It would be best to continue to concentrate on the bottom left at this point.  The way it's developing, blocking at A and claiming the corner while preasuring the two white stones makes sense.]
;W[sd];B[pg];W[bp];B[cq];W[bq];B[ck];W[dm];B[en];W[em];B[gn]
;W[fn];B[fo];W[fm];B[co]LB[go:A]C[Connecting at A at this point would be a good idea.  It helps strengthen your group, prevents against a cut there, and helps prevent white from closing you in.]
;W[go];B[gp]LB[fp:A]C[You don't really get anything from this move that you wouldn't get from A.  So, it would be better to just play A and avoid a potential double atari.]
;W[ho];B[hn]LB[fp:A]C[This isn't the time to be saving G6.  In fact, at this point in the game, it's hard to say if there will ever be a time when you'll really want to save it.  So, it would be best to just leave it alone till your sure you need it rather than adding stones to it and making it more important to save.

Protecting against the double atari by playing A is really big.  I'm surprised it goes such a long time without black protecting or white attacking.]

(;B[dk]LB[gk:A]C[This comes very close to working, but to make it really work, you need to play A first.]

(;B[jk]LB[gi:A]C[Black should play A right away.  (See variation.)]
;W[kk];B[gi];W[ik];B[jo]C[Looking for a local ko threat is a good idea.  But, unfortunately, this one isn't really a local threat.]
;W[ij];B[ko];W[ip];B[kp];W[im];B[nq]LB[qn:A]SQ[jo][ko][kp]C[Losing those stones in the middle means that it's really important to find the biggest moves from here on out.  While I do like how this move works with the squared stones, I think a move at A would be bigger.  Notice that it could also work well with those squared stones.]
;W[pn];B[nn]LB[ql:A][pr:B]C[Consider playing A or B here.  Both moves threaten to sneak underneath white's high fourth line stones.]
;W[qk];B[qj];W[rj];B[ri];W[rl];B[pl]LB[ol:A]C[This move is a mistake because it can be cut.  A knight's move at A would work better.]
;W[pk];B[om];W[ok];B[qm];W[qn];B[rm];W[rn];B[pq];W[pm];B[ol]
;W[ql];B[qp];W[on];B[nm]LB[ml:A]C[Connecting solidly here gives you trouble because it doesn't reach out towards any other group.  The trick to getting out of this mess is playing lightly and being prepared to sacrifice a stone or two.

Consider A instead.  It would help you connect to either the upper stones or the lower stones.

Also, keep in mind that you took the corner instead of making sure those stones were completely safe, and that corner was pretty big.  So, it's okay if you lose a couple stones as long as you don't invest too much in them.]
;W[no];B[op];W[oo];B[np]C[This move is just asking for white to extend and split your groups.  It would be better to focus on connecting center stones to something alive.]
;W[mo]C[I'm not entirely certain when saving those center stones ceases to be a possibility in this game, but around this point, it becomes very difficult.  You are at a big disadvantage because all of white's surrounding groups are very alive.  So, it would be best to play lightly and save what  you can.]
;B[ln];W[mn];B[nk];W[mm]C[From this point to the end, things are forced if your goal is to save everything.  So, any chance to save all your stones came prior to this point.]
;B[nl];W[nj];B[mk];W[mj];B[lk];W[li];B[kj];W[kh];B[ll];W[km]
;B[lm];W[lo];B[lq];W[ml]C[Resigning here makes sense.  White does have a large lead after the capture of that last group.

A lot of the mistakes in this game were reading mistakes, like the failure to see the ladder breaker and the missed chances to save stones.  If you practice reading as far as you can in your games, your reading skills will improve, and you'll make fewer mistakes of that sort.  Problems that focus on connecting and cutting stones would probably help too.

You also need to work on looking at the whole board when picking moves.  Try to think more about where a particular joseki is likely to lead and whether the result is better for you or for your opponent.  Also, think about whether or not moves that nab a few points help your overall board position.  If they don't help, save them for end game.

In your comments with the game, you said:
> I feel like I contested the bottom left corner poorly and built two groups that proved difficult to defend and ended up losing me the game.
> How might I have played more lightly: when should I have sacrificed and what should I have focused on instead?

I think the problems in the bottom left corner were caused by the way you initially handled white's approach and the fact that you focused on trying to save the outside stone that got caught off.  Other than ignoring the potential double atari, I think you handled it fine.  You just didn't focus on it much, so it suffered a bit.

Until you ran into problems with the floating group in the bottom, I don't think your play was too heavy.  My comments on when and where I think you should have focused elsewhere are scattered throughout the commentary.

I hope my advice helps.  If you have any questions on anything I said or failed to address, feel free to email me (gophantom@gmail.com).]
