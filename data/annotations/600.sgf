;B[lq];W[no];B[pn];W[kp]C[All good up to here.]
(;B[mp]C[Not good, but not very bad.  The stone on M3 is weak, and separated from friendly forces on the right.  This exchange - 13, 14 (N4, O4) helps White, since it makes him stronger, and gives him increased effect against the bottom right corner.



The usual move here is L3];W[np];B[mo]C[Right idea: separate the W stones.  Without this wM4 will join the W forces.]
;W[nn];B[pl]
(;W[pr]C[Suspect.  The natural exchange w18, bR3 removes the possibility of the invasion at R3, and does not give the w group 2 eyes: i.e. it must still get out into the  middle.  Probably better to get out into the middle; later, when the w group  on the O line is safe, w can invade the corner]
;B[mr]C[Bad. Either R3 to keep up the pressure on the O line w group, or strengthen the black group with L3.  This does not even threaten to cut (see var'n).]

(;B[jr]C[Does not need to be low.  Avoid 2nd line moves early on if possible.]
;W[iq];B[ir];W[hq];B[fc]C[Should not tenuki here.  Lower side is very hot.  R3 is still very big; and the bottom black group is still very vulnerable, it should move out to the centre, strengthening itself, and weakening the w stones either side.]

;B[ri];W[pf];B[qe];W[qi];B[qj];W[pi];B[nk]C[w 34 and 36 do not do much to strengthen the weak w group.  A jump towards the middle would be better instead.]
