C[Xinwen :::

Hello, 

First of all, I am your reviewer ^^^ nice meeting you.


Thank you for reviewing my game!

I have no idea why I lost - I'd love any and all pointers you can give me =)

Thank you,

- Derek];B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc]

K16 was kinda an interesting move by white. It seems K16 is full of confident.

In another point of view, K16 is actually trying to counterattack your R16.]
;B[ic]LB[cc:A][fe:C][cf:B]C[Xinwen :::

I am not sure about J17 as i usually would think of "A", "B" or "C" answering the K16.

Reason is that, K16 doesnt get any land and D16 is weak and vulnerable to attack.]
;W[ec]
(;B[eb];W[fd];B[gc];W[db];B[fb]LB[cc:A][ee:C][cf:B]C[Xinwen :::

In the consequences, white actually get a bigger corner BUT it is still insecure as black has "A", "B" or "C"]
;W[od];B[pc]LB[jc:B][oc:C][ld:E][md:D][ge:A]C[Was this move good?

Xinwen :::

Indeed, white P16 is good as when white's C then B, white got strengthen. because white has K16.

But frankly saying, i think the game still even as white corner wasn't that secure.

So my suggestion is that you should have pincer it at "D" or "E" would be better?

But now, when you go back to your 8th move, which i think it is the cause.]
;W[oc];B[nb]LB[jc:A][pf:B]C[Xinwen :::

Probably, O18 was a overplay, kinda too greedy because black need to settle the 2 stones by playing at "B" and doing "A" by black would also be nice.]
;W[ob];B[kb]LB[qf:A]C[Xinwen :::

Again, i think making "L18" move is not consider URGENT, settling at R14 would be better]
;W[qe]C[Xinwen :::

To answer your "Q 17 move, was it good"?

The answer shown here, it is bad.];B[pb];W[pd];B[rd];W[re];B[cb]
C[Xinwen :::

Attacking at C18 is kinda early.];W[cc];B[da];W[bb];B[fq]C[Xinwen :::

Yes, Ignoring and attack at F3 is good.];W[cn]

I don't think attacking in this way is good you help to strengthen white. Moreover, the invasion part i mentioned earlier gone.]
;W[cj];B[bj];W[bk];B[bi]C[Xinwen :::

Actually, i don't like B11, your shape got heavier, do you not think so ?]

(;W[df];B[cf];W[de];B[ch]C[Xinwen :::

Don't be happy that White didn't manage to kill black, because white made a mistake somewhere.

Need to learn to win by skill not by luck ^^^];W[er];B[bl]C[Xinwen :::

And in fact, doing this kind of move does not help much.

1) you managed to dig some lands from white

2) White gains thickness toward the center.

Something to remember that you need timing to do invasion, recklessly doing it will cause you lots of pain.]

This is very good invasion by white. 

White has thickness to invade which is very good];B[qp];W[or]
;B[pr];W[pq];B[op];W[qr];B[sn];W[pk]C[Xinwen :::

Saving the white stones very bad.];B[rk];W[fp];B[dr]C[Xinwen :::

This is too much again, just E1 kinda of move would be better.]

;W[an];B[bq];W[cr];B[ar];W[cq];B[hr]C[Xinwen :::

you lost here ^^^

The reason behinds that, you don't know how to judge the timing of invasion, and you are too concern about territory profit which in return you give away the thickness to the other player.

Must balance,  every territory of yours must learn to jump out facing the center of the board.]

If White goes for C14, answer your F17 easily, then you can play L17 resulting "Mini Chinese Fuseki"

You don't have to worry about "A" invasion by white as you can "B" and later "C" invasion.]
