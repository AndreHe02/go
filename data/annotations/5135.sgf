C[[Way*\] Hi, I'm playing as White; my handle is WayFarer.  My opponent 
resigned when a fight began, but I'm not sure who would have won that fight. 
  Prior to that point, it seemed that we were even.  I'd like to know any 
major mistakes I made and such.  Thanx for the review!

[Way*\] I prefix all of my comments with "[Way*\]" .

[Way*\] Thanx for all the comments!];B[pq];W[pe];B[dp];W[cd]
C[[Way*\] I have been experimenting with this type of opening for some 
time.]
(;B[dj]C[(Dtyler) : Shimari on right side is better.];W[po]
;B[np]C[[Way*\] This gave me pause.  I did not want to attach
at R3, b/c then the joseki would end with him playing
J3 or J4, and he would have a nice framework very
early in the opening.  Thus, I decided to tenuki.  Was
that incorrect of me?


(Dtyler) : Yes, that's a good idea.];W[pc];B[nn]C[(Dtyler) : Nice move.]
;W[iq]C[[Way*\] Establish a presence in the enemy's sphere of influence...]

(;B[kq]C[[Way*\] This seemed to be wrong.  Should my
opponent have played G3 instead, and push me into
his influence?

(Dtyler) : See variation.];W[fq]
(;B[fp]C[[Way*\] I did not expect this.  That only helps me
settle.


(Dtyler) : Playable.]
(;W[gp]C[(Dtyler) : I don't like white shape.
              Overconcentrate but I don't know how to play]
;B[eq];W[fo];B[ep];W[go]C[[Way*\] I chose to connect on the outside so that I am
not sealed in.  If he cuts at G3, I can play H3 and then
make the mouth shape at J5.  Playing J6 (instead of
J5) also looked like interesting sabaki.  In any case,
Black has little to no chance to making a framework
in the lower left.


(Dtyler) : Good idea but overconcentrate];B[cn];W[fr]C[[Way*\] I don't know if this move is a good move.  It
fixes up my shape, and gives me endgame access
into the corner.  R7 was also urgent, but I decided
that fixing up my shape is more important.  I have
been working on my shape lately, and trying to avoid
weak groups.


(Dtyler) : I don't know what is better between F2 and
              move like Q8 but I prefer F2.];B[pm]C[[Way*\] Huge.  Bigger than I expected, as well.]
;W[ec];B[jd]C[(Dtyler) : Black is wrong.
               R11 is bigger.];W[ld];B[lc]C[[Way*\] I'm not sure how to respond to this.]
;W[mc];B[kc];W[ch]C[[Way*\] I felt that connecting at N16 was
uninteresting.  I'd have a two stone wall facing my
shimari - it has no value.  If I play there, black plays
G17, settling his group.  I felt no reason to induce
him to settle while gaining so little, so I took a big
point.

[Way*\] C12 aims for the invasion at C8, later.  In
comparison to the right side, I'm not sure which is
better.  In retrospect, probably the right side.

[Way*\] Also, is H17 viable?  It would induce Black to
cut at N16 or hane at N18, letting me have some
profit in sente.


(Dtyler) : This is Ok.

               N18 is better than H17.]
(;B[ci]C[(Dtyler) : Bad move];W[dh]C[[Way*\] I still have the tesuji at C9.]
;B[mb]C[(Dtyler) : Too small.]
(;W[qi]C[[Way*\] Big.  My opponent let me get both big points.

[Way*\] Should I have played R9 or R10  instead?  I
threaten to rescue Q6?  See variation.

(Dtyler) : See variation.];B[qk];W[oi];B[nc]
(;W[ne]C[[Way*\] This aims to save my stones (which I really
don't care about), and more importantly, it helps me
create a small moyo.  I felt I was behind b/c of
Black's large lower right corner.]
(;B[md]C[(Dtyler) : Too small. After this I don't say anything
               about black's bad move. I'll will put only
               variation.];W[nk]C[[Way*\] Border of two moyos.]
;B[me]
(;W[nf]C[(Dtyler) : Slow];B[pb]
(;W[qc]C[(Dtyler) : Black can't do anything.];B[qb];W[mf]C[(Dtyler) : Slow]

(;B[lf];W[lg];B[kf];W[kg];B[ml];W[mk];B[ll];W[oc];B[ob];W[qq]
C[[Way*\] Now I try something over in the corner.  I
have no idea if it's possible.


(Dtyler) : See my variation.];B[qr];W[qm]
(;B[ql]C[(Dtyler) : See variation.];W[rr];B[pr]
(;W[pn]C[[Way*\] I was debating between this and R4.  I didn't
think R4 would give me a living shape, so I tried to
escape instead.


(Dtyler) : This is Ok. See variation.]
(;B[qp]C[[Way*\] Black ruins my chances of living, so now I am
forced to try to escape.

(Dtyler) : See my variation.];W[om];B[pl];W[on];B[ol]C[[Way*\] I believe this is correct for Black.  If Black plays O8, then I 
can push at P8, and the Q8 Black stones are cut off.];W[nm]
;B[nl];W[no]
(;B[mn]C[(Dtyler) : See variation.];W[mo];B[ln];W[kp]C[[Way*\] At this point, I've realized that I cannot connect out, so I at 
least try to quell the L3 stone.]
(;B[op]C[[Way*\] I think this is a mistake.  He should've cut me
at M5.


(Dtyler) : I think so.
(Dtyler) : See variation.];W[mp]C[[Way*\] I let Black cut off my main group.]
;B[oo];W[lq]C[[Way*\] I quell the L3 stone and expand some territory on the bottom side. 
  Black's lower right moyo (however small it was) has no potential to expand 
anymore.

[Way*\] Given that I should've lost the N5 White stones, I am satisfied with 
this outcome.];B[lk];W[ck]C[[Way*\] Play M10 seemed uninteresting, as Black's hane at L10 would 
flatten my moyo anyways.  So I tenuki to the C9 tesuji.]
(;B[cl]C[[Way*\] I have no idea what this is supposed to be.]
;W[dk]
(;B[gd]C[[Way*\] A fairly big point.];W[gb]C[[Way*\] This seems bigger than submissively defending at E15.]

(;B[gc]C[[Way*\] Mistake?

(Dtyler) : Sure.
               See variation.];W[hb];B[ic]C[[Way*\] Another mistake?]
;W[bk]
(;B[bl];W[al];B[am];W[ak];B[bn];W[dr];B[er];W[es];B[cr];W[cs]
;B[br];W[ee]C[[Way*\] Now I come back to fix up my upper left.  It looks sizeable, and 
even bigger if I get to play E10.];B[ri];W[rh];B[rj];W[qg];B[gf]

(;W[fj]C[[Way*\] This is dual purpose.  I think this stops Black
from escaping.  It also aims to make some territory
around G7.

[Way*\] Would E10 be better?  It reduces bad aji, as it
is firmer.

(Dtyler) : See variation.]
(;B[jn];W[mi]C[[Way*\] Fix my shape.  Not sure if that was the best
move.  I know S18 is pretty big, at this point.

(Dtyler) : S18 = 9 points];B[jp];W[jq];B[ko];W[lp];B[kr];W[lr]
;B[jg];W[jh];B[ig];W[nq];B[nr]C[[Way*\] I think he should've simply connected at P3.


(Dtyler) : Now the situation is pretty close.
               Black lead about 5 pts plus reserve komi.];W[pp]

[qe]C[[Way*\] 
Black resigns here.  I didn't even get a chance to read out the fight. 
Estimating the scoring the board, assuming he wins the lower right corner, I 
get::

White Total: 75.5
Upper left: 41
Upper right: 25
Bottom: 15
Captures: 0
Reverse Komi: -5.5

Black Total: 83
Top: 24
Lower Left: 13
Lower Right: 45
Captures: 1

So Black's ahead.  In order for White to win, it'll come down to serious 
endgame, like S18 and what happens in the center.

The lower right was quite large, but otherwise I really don't know what else 
I did that is clearly wrong.

Thanx for the comments!]
