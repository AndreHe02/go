RE[B+Resign]

C[Game between me (11k - white) and Berabo (12k - black) on KGS.

I would appreciate any information on what the moments are at which I lost the game. I believe that I often battle on for too long and forget to make the biggest move. Aside from that I think I tend to misjudge the way to recude or attack a piece of potential enemy territory and get into trouble due to this.

However all advice and comment is ofcourse welcome.];B[pd];W[qp]
C[what are you thinking? why did you play on the same side that black? It is important that you set up an strategy for the opening and that you keep you play consistent with that strategy. do you mean to start the fighting early and keep black form making shape? This is alright but you must be very careful not to fall in your own traps]
;B[dp];W[dd];B[oq];W[pn];B[lq];W[pq]C[I don't know if this move is valuable enough to be played at this stage, looking back at it now.
teh move it is not bad on itself, but the point is if it is consistent with the opening strategy. If you want to keep high pressure on black 
you must do so at the expense of delaying getting secure territory at the beginning, being careful of not making weak heavy groups of your own]
;B[cf]C[you may take this opportunity to paly tenuki and keep the pressure on the 2 black stones on th elower right by playing around h3]
;W[fd];B[bd];W[cc]C[this style of playing is not consistent with the opening play]
;B[dj];W[nq]C[Should've played K17? Either way, I was unsure how to attack the two stones at M3 and P3, even though they looked weak to me close to my power on the bottom right.
you might come from the other side, not to kill the two stones, but press them against you thickness an d get a base to attack the left side]

;B[mr];W[os];B[mo];W[nn]C[Again this move might not be the biggest one. But it seems to make a difference for power towards the center a bit.]
;B[pj]C[it was better for black to play on the lower left or extend to m7 and make a huge moyo on the left side. If white extends to q10
black can extend to k16 and the exchange would be terrible for white. as it stands white can pressure the six black stones and erase black moyo]
;W[iq]C[Even though this invasion was farely succesful, I suppose there would be better ways to attack or reduce the potential black territory at the bottom. I didn't and don't see how though.]
;B[io]C[white is alitlle to close to black, g3, g4 or h3 would be better]
;W[hp];B[jn];W[eq]C[this move forces black to take the corner an weakens the white group, thus cannot be good. white should run into the center at this point an d keep the pressure on the balck group on a race for life]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[do];W[dh];B[ef]C[I expected black to connect underneath and then to be able to form an outside wall. This move kind of took me by surprise.
you should not count on meek play to succed];W[ei]C[I suppose this is to slow.]
;B[cj];W[ch];B[gf];W[hd];B[if];W[jd]C[Here I guess my C13 group shuold've had the priority and an extension there would be more appropriate?
at this point it does look dififcult for white. Now white has two weak groups and the black groups look strong although not settle yet. this means that c12 was a bad move]
;B[fk]C[black is playing good];W[gi];B[ii];W[hj];B[hm];W[fg]

;B[mj];W[mk];B[nj];W[mn];B[eo]C[This move was pretty detrimental for me...]
;W[fo];B[fn];W[go];B[ld];W[en]C[This is my desperate attempt to turn the game around.]

;B[bk];W[cl];B[bl];W[dl];B[ck]C[No such luck... here I resigned.
white fall on his own traps. it made three weak groups inside black strenght and tried to save all of them.]
