TM[600]KM[0.5];B[qd];W[qp];B[dc];W[de];B[di];W[od];B[dp]C[ ** Very good.]
;W[fq]C[ ** Looks more urgent to play in one of the top corners.];B[dn]
;W[dr];B[cq];W[iq];B[fd]C[ ** Good.];W[cc];B[cb];W[cd];B[eb];W[ff]C[ ** White should secure a base with a). Black should now take the base away with b) (see variation).]

(;B[mc]MA[fd][ff]LB[oe:A][pf:B]C[  ** For choosing a joseki you have to decide which side is most important. In this case black is low and solid on the top (cf. the marked stones) so not much territory or point in playing there. The right has great potential for white, so this is where both players should try to  play. The pincer may be ok, but I would prefer a simpler approach with a) or b).]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[ ** This is definitely dubious. The normal joseki gives white the right and black the top which is what black doesn't want. Instead a) is better (see previous variation for the continuation).]
;W[pd];B[oc];W[nc];B[nd];W[nb];B[qb];W[rc];B[ob]C[ ** See variation for normal joseki.]

(;W[mb]C[ ** Blunder. This turn is typically played when the top is important. As seen in the game it requires a favourable ladder.]
;B[md]LB[pe:A][lb:B]C[ ** Exactly! Now a) and b) are miai.];W[qe];B[lb]
;W[pj]LB[ne:A]C[ ** White lost the forcing move at a), but because he played in the right direction the overall result is still acceptable for him.]
;B[oq];W[pq]C[ ** Logical because the pincer is not worth much.];B[op];W
[pn];B[pr];W[qr];B[kq]C[ ** Good.];W[jc]LB[cg:A][dl:B]C[ ** No point in playing here - black is strong. a) or an invasion at b) seems more logical.]
;B[kc]LB[hc:A][dg:B]C[ ** White is not threatening anything so a) or b) seems better.]
;W[gc];B[bb]LB[gd:A][bc:B]MA[gc][ff]C[ ** Push first at a) to break the connection between the marked stones. Then b) is probably better giving you maximum eye space.]
;W[dl];B[cl]MA[di]C[ ** This is not good as it weakens the marked stone above. Here is a rule of thumb: Unless you can connect your stones don't attach like this when your opponent invades.]
;W[ck];B[cm];W[dj]LB[ci:A][bk:B]C[ ** a) next from black threatens to connect at b).]
;B[fi]LB[ci:A]C[ ** Not good - black has to keep the white groups separated by playing at a). Both groups above and below are quite weak.]

[ed];B[fc];W[bf];B[gd];W[ie]C[ ** Good move.];B[hd];W[gh];B[gi];W[id];B
[ic]LB[hc:A][jb:B]C[ ** A tesuji but too loose. Simply playing a) doesn't give white any forcing moves, and black later has b).]
;W[hh];B[hi];W[jb];B[hc];W[kd];B[nf];W[rb]LB[pa:A]C[ ** Very big, but white could play a) first.]
;B[ma]LB[pa:A]C[ ** Answering at a) is bigger and would ensure two eyes for black. That's why white probably should have played there on the last move.]
;W[pg];B[ih];W[hf];B[ig]LB[ef:A]C[ ** This seems unreasonable, but black is probably aiming at the cut a).]
;W[ii];B[ij]LB[kg:A]C[ ** Looks better just to jump to a) - avoid unnecessary ataris.]
;W[ji];B[kg];W[jj];B[ik];W[mh];B[lf];W[nm]LB[ef:A]C[ ** Has to be at a) of course.]
;B[ef]C[ ** Good. Black has now turned the game around.];W[jf];B[kh];W[mq]
;B[lp]LB[mp:A]C[ ** Seems safer to attach at a) - in this case it connects black's stones! The kosumi is more aggressive, and is therefore appropriate only when black's surrounding position is stronger. See variation for a possible continuation for white.]
