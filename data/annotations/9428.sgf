C[ I wanted to say before you review, Thank you very much for taking the time to review my game. =) I apologize ahead of time for the foolish mistakes I inevitably made in this game. I'm playing as Black, my opponent is a good friend of mine, so we know each other's styles quite well.

[kb\]:];B[qc];W[dp];B[oq]C[Move 1 and 3: I'm fond of sansan fuseki, as I tend to play a territorial game. As of late, I have been studying the games of Hosai and Sakata, particularly the latter was the influence to play the 5-3.

[kb\]: I can see you are fond of setpiece openings.  Unfortunately, you have a reviewer who is not, especially at low-dan levels.  I feel they hold back your progress and breakthrough to higher dan strength.]
;W[dc];B[ce]TR[qp]C[Move 5: My friend loves the Chinese fuseki, and I quite honestly don't like playing against it, so I usually prevent it. This was my reason for not playing at the Triangle.]
;W[cg];B[qj]CR[de]TR[qp]SQ[jd]LB[oc:3][nd:1][od:2][qm:B][qn:A]
C[Move 7: From studying the games of Hosai, I've discovered that he quite often plays this move when he already has the Sub-Orthodox fuseki,(completed with a move at the triangle). I took this opportunity to play the extension first without the play at the triangle because I thought it was interesting to try. I considered it a faster form of developement, preparing a pincer at A or B if my opponent played at the triangle, while also giving support to my 3-3 if my opponent plays at 1  allowing me to pincer at the square, which would further reduce white's potential of influence. Especially if he plays the tenuki variation at the circle, giving himself a wall on the outside. (As a territorial type player, I relish the opportunity to make my opponent's influence worth close to nothing...particularly my friend's.) If he played at 2 or 3, the extention would be at a nice location to link up with my corner.

[kb\]: It's a good line of thinking, but it's not common to tenuki from C15 unless Black has a stone at top to mitigate the resulting thickness.  See variation.]

(;W[kd]CR[od]C[Move 8: I personally don't understand this move, except aiming at the circle.

[kb\]: He is aiming to play D15, so you must jump immediately here.]
;B[fq]CR[od][pd]TR[qp]SQ[oj]C[Move 9: I considered just finishing my fuseki at the triangle, which if White played at one of the circles, I could potentially look forward to playing the square, especially if a running fight occured. However, I didn't want to play that way, I wanted to disrupt his hoshi and to develop in the direction of my 5-3

[kb\]: This is the wrong direction.  Black needs to develop the top stone, as getting sealed in lets White use L16 beautifully.]
;W[cn];B[jp]LB[cq:2][iq:3][dr:1]C[Move 11: This was my intention. I like the "Kobayashi formation", with the 5-3. I also considered the variation given, producing an Iwata's formation with a 5-3.]
;W[od]C[[kb\]: Lukewarm compared to what White can do by first sealing D15 in.]
;B[pe];W[pc]C[Move 14: I don't know why this was played.

[kb\]: Yes, aji keshi.];B[qd];W[oe];B[dg]TR[qp]SQ[kd]C[Move 17: I found it necessary to try to prouce some influence, or more or less "just to get out", due to the square group. Would I be able to leave D13 alone for now, and play the triangle? I considered it, but decided to play D13 instead.

[kb\]: It is dangerous to tenuki from the top right this early, so you must end this combination with sente.]
;W[dh];B[df];W[ci];B[fd];W[ed];B[fe];W[fc]
(;B[gc]C[[kb\]: While this move looks natural, you might consider H16 instead.  See variation.]
;W[ee]LB[fb:1][hd:2]C[Move 26: I think this is a mistake in joseki, but while playing, I was not sure how to properly respond. Normally it's played as the variation given.]
;B[ff];W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[eh]TR[ee]SQ[fc]C[Move 31: This is similar to the variation where White plays the triangle without first playing the square. I wasn't too concerned, my group on the left could get out, and he didn't have too much of an attack on my right.]
;W[gd];B[fb];W[ec];B[he]C[Move 35: I took a while thinking about this. I wasn't completely certain it was correct.

[kb\]: Good move, considering the circumstances.  White probably could have played better.]
;W[hd]C[[kb\]: White could have played atari first.  Now, he helps you make shape.]
;B[id];W[hc];B[ic];W[hb];B[if]TR[mc]SQ[ic]C[Move 41: This is what I intended. Now I have a center facing group, and the square stones have good aji in the triangled area.

[kb\]: Yes, this is an *excellent* result for you.  The reason is explained indirectly on the next move.]
;W[po]C[Move 42: This was prehaps long past due, but I welcomed it.

[kb\]: This is a White overplay.  You should take sente after this sequence to first solidify the Black stones on the left in sente, then attack the White group at the top.]
;B[qp]C[[kb\]: I'm not sure this is the best move here, as you end up owing a move at top.]
;W[qo];B[pp];W[oo];B[np];W[oj]
(;B[pl]TR[ph]C[Move 49: I know the proverb: "Knight's move from a cap", but, I question this move. Is it too appgressive? Dare I say, "vulgar" Should I have played the triangle instead, or would that have been too submissive? Is the correct move something else altogether?

[kb\]: Attaching at P9 may be acceptable here, as the three White stones are hard to give up.  See variation.]
;W[pk]C[[kb\]: White thwarts your intentions.];B[qm]TR[qk]SQ[nm]
LB[ol:A][om:B]C[Move 51: This move looks silly, but my reasoning behind it, was that it threatened the connection at the triangle, which my opponent did play, and then it allowed me to jump to the square. If A, I could respond with B, and I thought the fight would be better for me.

[kb\]: I applaud your out-of-the-box thinking here, but the strategy is unsound.  It is too large to give up R9.  See more comments and variations on move 53.]
;W[qk];B[nm]C[Move 53: As intended.

[kb\]: Lots of aji here, plus White can gain a significant amount of points and forcing moves at the top now.  Furthermore, the opportunity to attack the top group has vanished.  See variation.]

(;W[ei]C[[kb\]: Horrible, horrible aji keshi.];B[fh];W[gg];B[ge]
C[[kb\]: Perhaps White forgot that this was sente?];W[ib];B[ih]
;W[je];B[ie];W[jb]C[[kb\]: This move is unfortunate, because it no longer is dual-purpose after the White stones on the right are in place.  Black has a secure group in the center and White can make no more points.  I think Black still has the advantage.]
;B[dk]TR[dr]SQ[fo]LB[dj:B][dm:A]C[Move 63: I thought I would need to play somewhere on this side, but I didn't know which move to play. I thought of the press at A, or just peeping at B...in the end, I chose to play in the middle. Should I have played the triangle, then aim at the square? This looks better to me now, due to the outward facing dirction of the square stone,

[kb\]: Peeping at B is correct, followed by a shoulder hit at A.]
;W[ck]C[[kb\]: Wow...];B[dj];W[cj];B[di];W[dl];B[ch]C[Move 69: This seemed to go too well for me, but I'm not sure what to think of this outcome.

[kb\]: No kidding!];W[hq]
(;B[jq]SQ[iq]C[Move 71: I didn't know what to do, so I left the F3 stone a lone and strengthend my corner and side. It still has some aji. Should I have played the square instead?

[kb\]: This seems a little passive, but your reasoning is correct.  You could also lean off the corner first.  See variation.]
;W[fp];B[cq]C[[kb\]: This plan is also acceptable, since White's thickness will be doing little.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[er];W[ep];B[gq]LB[bo:B][bp:A][bq:C]C[Move 79: Perhaps this is a silly move, due to the follow up. However, I did end up in sente, so I couldn't consider it too much of a failure. Is there something else I should have played? I considered the A and C continuation after White B.

[kb\]: This move is completely "silly" since connecting at F2 has basically the same effect.]
;W[gp]C[[kb\]: Last chance, play at G2...];B[hr];W[fr];B[gr]
;W[dr];B[fs];W[cr]C[[kb\]: Black gains nothing.];B[ph]C[Move 87: I went back and played the move I thought I needed to play.

[kb\]: Lucky for you that White didn't push you around here first as I commented on move 53.]
;W[pi];B[qh];W[oh]
(;B[fl]C[Move 91: I question the timing of this move, but it seemed like a good area to play in, because both White and Black want to expand.

[kb\]: Wrong direction.  Playing at E8 is sente if you want to force.  Playing large endgame right now is also OK.

End of comments.  You are ahead and it seems (except for time) this game is hard to lose.]
;W[pf];B[qf];W[pg];B[qg];W[kg];B[ki]C[Move 97: Too submissive?]
;W[jl];B[ni]C[Move 99: Probably silly.];W[oi];B[hm];W[mk];B[ll]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[kl];B[lm];W[kj];B[jk];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij];B[hk]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[jh]C[End of Game: I lost on time. The solidifcation of the bottom was more than welcome. I was looking at yose at B17, playing H5, and S10 and B12. So, I had potentional to stay ahead. My style is perhaps too thin, maybe too fluid. Overall, I'm looking for input on the proper way to handle the joseki exchange that lead to my top left black group. What was the best way to go about that? Any suggestions for fuseki/middle game, and of course, any mistakes in thinking and variations. I tried to write down every consideration I had, so that you can follow my train of thought,(even if it happens to be wrong.)
 Thank you again for your time.
