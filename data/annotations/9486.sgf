===================

ABOUT MY REVIEW:

- everything generall, that has to be said, is written here below. please read that first. 
- during the game, i often made variation. some of them only for me, to see, what could happen (some of them much too long). these are nice for you to see. MOST of the variations are for you, to see what i mean, when i comment on a move. i think it's important for you to see alternatives, when i criticise your move. there may be even some bad variations (commented simply with "no"), so you can see, that a proper follow up of my suggested move is important.
- i tried to use the symbols and characters in a way that helps more than it confuses. ;-) and i usually used circles to mark stones that are probably dead.

First about YOUR QUESTIONS at the end:

1. My opponent resigned, but he has about 30 points more than me. Right?
- Yes, there was no reason in the game for white to resign at that point.
2. White has a big territory on the middle of the right side and I missed the moment of invasion. When I could effectively invide there?
- You could have invaded there as early as stone 8 or 18. Later on it would prove difficult especially if you're not the strongest in combat as i am. not invading however could /hsould have given you the opportunity to build territory (with you wals for example) yourself
 
OVERALL:

It was a nice game with lots of good moves. Neither of you seem to be reckless and usually prefer solid but in general not to slow moves. That's good. Being defensive in the beginning is not a bad thing, too. there is alway much much potential in the beginning. 
That being said, however, it seems you lack the experience in the matter of wihich direction to play and which moves are the biggest / most important (preferably forehand). Good thing, there's an easy cure for that: experience ;-) With more games / experience you will develop a feeling for what's really important and can practice to read ahead (if this then that, that, that and that...)

BIGGEST MISTAKES in my opinion:

- moves 56 and 62 were particulary bad, becauce you gained nothing, lost your forehand and started something that was contrary to what you wanted before: 2 walls which make it hard for white to go for the "center to bottom" area
(- with 72, 76 and 170 you probably haven't read ahead much)
- at 134 you are backstabbing yourself again. building a wall doesn't mean to build a border of your territory, walls are tools to make enemy stone between the walls suffer and if possible die (and then potenitally ultimately become borders of your territory, yes)
- in my opinion the endgame starts at stone move 170 give or take. you shouldn't lose forehand in the endgame. i guess, you probably lost at least 15 points in the endgame

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS : 

FOREHAND: 
forehand means you play a stone and the opponent has to answer, so after the sequence it's your turn again. it is very important so you can keep the control over what is happening and in which direction the game is going to develop
BACKHAND: 
backhand is the opposite of forehand and describes everey move/sequence after which it's the opponents turn (loss of control)
DIRECTION: 
it is important to think about which direction you want sequences to develop. it's not always the best idea to go for territory or save a few stones if after the sequence a big wall loses its influence and therefore its importance.
WALL: 
a wall means strength but it's useless if it doesn't point to your own stones and helps them to survive or attack enemy stones or create territory]
