The way he abandoned the r9 group to build a stronghold in LL, then to make  the r9 group live again is a big loss for white.]

w l17 or m17 might be better.];B[pb];W[qb];B[ob];W[pe];B[kc]C[the only  strength of w was p12 wall. It was a great strength. Despite that b has  settled quietly on the U side, without being attacked.]

w has now a huge handicap and no b weak group to attack. He even has the d15  group not yet settled. The only hope is a b blunder ...]
;B[cf]C[   pongracz 16k*: is entering byo-yomi

b puts pressure on the w unsettled group,
but it could have been better for him to attack from the center, forcing w to  live on the side and "swallowing" e8.]
;W[df];B[dg];W[eg];B[cg];W[eh];B[ff];W[gg];B[ej];W[gl];B[dn]C[
b has not gained very much in attacking w d15. He has even allowed w to hope  gaining some 10 points in the center by "closing" the upper side with g13.  However w center is still opened at e10 and j7. This and the weakness at j15  should prevent w from catching up with b advantage (still 30 pts).]

(;W[dk]C[GP: F10 instead?

w d9 is good enough as it threaten to cut off b c11 group.];B[gj]
(;W[fk];B[fj];W[dj]C[i think w d10 is too small, as it does not cut b c11 from the corner.]
;B[di];W[il]C[as b does not want w to get territory in the center, w could  take the opportunity to cut b c11 group from the corner with b10. I don't  think b could connect to either of his other groups. This would force him to  live, w gaining in the process a low stone on the left side (to ruin b LL)  and strength to invade the lower side.]

;W[if];B[ge];W[hi];B[jg];W[kf];B[ei];W[hj]C[w succeeded in closing  the three weak points to his center and gained 20 pts in the process, thanks  to b :-)]
;B[jl];W[jm]C[GP: opps, L7 didn't need the help.

j9 might be better];B[hl];W[ik];B[hm];W[hk];B[gk];W[gm];B[ho];W[bk];B[dl]
;C[i cannot see who is to win the semeai, but w seems short of  liberties. However b should not have let w cut him off, he should have  connected along the side.
On the other point of vue, w should have cut off b as soon as possible.

To conclude i think that w knows how to play safely, and how to defend. But  he has to learn how to use strength to attack (i do not know either :-). The  better sign is b play at p17, where w was the strongest, that now extends up  to f13! (p15 too defensive, k15 missed the cut)

However this is likely not to be sufficient. So w will need to try to reduce  b lower area, by attempting or threatening to separate b k3 k5 and j7 from  the corner. This is perhaps possible, once w has strengthened his g8  group.]
