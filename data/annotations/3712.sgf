C[Dear reviewer,

I played this with White on KGS.
I normally play as a 7 kyu, but this time only the komi saved me from
losing against 9 kyu. I'm used to playing a sanren sei, but I don't know how
to treat a kakari against my corner stone (see move 14) maybe you can tell me
what my options are at this point.
The trouble with large frameworks is, they are easy to invade. I often end up defending
while my opponent has stable corner territories and can put all into the attack - like in
this game.
    Would like some help with my opening strategy as well as treating enemy invasions.

Many thanks !

(;B[ql]LB[qh:A]C[I think that the other way (A) is better for black. see variation]
;W[qg];B[qo]C[a bit overconcentrated (black)];W[jp]C[good point!]
;B[lq];W[dj]C[also good point!];B[fc];W[hc]C[One reviewer recommended this instead of my earlier habit of playing J16.
But, the way I treated this here, it helped Black make territory on the upper side.

That reviewer is correct. I also prefare this. Since you had disscussion on this, i guess there is no need to say what you should do in case Black invades at 3-3 now :-)]

(;W[fg]LB[hg:A]TR[hc][he]C[All moves you played by now where natural, so I made no comment on them. This move now shouldn't be bad but i think is more important to strengthen the two marked stones that are weak. I would play at A.]

(;W[cd]LB[dc:A]C[this one is wrong. I think "A" was the correct direction of blocking. Black will make life in the corner but the fight is outside and the coner will take no part in it.]

(;W[dn]LB[ed:B][fp:A]C[if you are going to strengthen your moyo, "A" is better. Another possibility is "B". This would tak the corner back but it will end in gote. See variations.]

(;W[do]C[I was undecided between this and K3.
What you played is an excelent move and definitely better than K3. The subsequent play showed that both you and your opponent failed to realise that this move threatens to kill the Black group at the left. The kill is showed on the variation on the next move. Your move D5 is good because it makes the white wall strong in sente.]
;B[hq]LB[bn:A]C[Black should have defended at "A".]

;W[jq];B[io];W[hr];B[gr];W[is];B[gp]LB[nq:A]C[If Black can get 3 successful invasions into my territory, something must be wrong.
Either with my opening, or my treating of the invasions.

Nothing is wrong! either the upper left corner or the left side black group is there for you to take. Your power at K3 gives you the possibility to invade at "A" now. I think white has a nice game now. You are winning :-)]

;W[gd];B[id];W[ge];B[fd];W[ff]C[Which is larger, this or G17 ? Once he gets in my moyo, he'll have many follow up moves.

what you played is fine to me. But after Black plays G17 now, kill the left side group and win the game.]
;B[gc]
(;W[mg]C[Maybe I should have played a large move instead (variations),
but Black gets a lot of aji if he plays N13.

i think N13 is not dangerous right nowit will cut two very strong groups and will be very weak itself.]
;B[jk]C[This one is like a bomb, threatening to devastate my moyo or to grab the right lower corner.

By attacking this stone you will get a lot (e.g. the power to destroy some of the territory Black was planning to have at the right botom. You have power above this black stone, so use it for attack!

I will stop commenting the game here, because I think I answered the basic questions you had.
