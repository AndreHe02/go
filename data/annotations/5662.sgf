AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]PL[W];W[cf];B[ef]C[Why not. But the joseki which normally follows aims at influence at top, so it's best if Black already have a stone around k16]

(;W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[di]C[The black stone d12 is a kikashi (forcing move). So, after Black played it, he should give it up :)
Furthermore, e11 just calls d10, and being hit at the head of your stones is always bad. There are still so many places to play, bigger than this point... K16, K4, Q10 are examples.]

(;W[nc];B[ne]C[Bad. It is clearly the wrong direction. For the same reason that I mentioned earlier, but it is even more important here: K16 is now a pincer AND an extension at once.  Let White go to L17 is bad, for Black's moyo, and also because he lose an opportunity to attack White.]
;W[kc];B[ld];W[lc];B[kd]C[Well, i spoke about this one too ^^]
;W[jp];B[mq]C[Q10 is bigger. Again, Black's wall needs an extension.]
;W[gp]
(;B[er];W[fq];B[eq];W[cn];B[co]LB[dn:2][co:1]C[Bad move. Generally, the exchange of 1 for 2 is bad.]
;W[ck];B[ek];W[en];B[eo]C[Don't know what the aim is? Q10 is still a lot bigger. Black still can have an easy game if he takes this point.]
;W[fn];B[pj]C[Is black's main aim to get influence in the middle?

Yeah, it must be in his mind :)  But it is now not as good as it could have been.
However, if there is no mistake from Black, the game is his.]
;W[qn]C[Here is an example where the exchange i spoke about earlier is good.]

(;B[rq]C[There is no pressure on white with this move. Therefore, it's bad.]
;W[oo];B[po];W[on];B[pn]C[The idea to cut white is good. In handicap, it's always a good idea ^^]
;W[qk]
(;B[pk]
(;W[pm];B[qo]C[Bad, bad, bad. An empty angle. Black could have avoided it if he had cut earlier.]
;W[ql];B[rn]TR[jc][qj][om]C[Useless. There is more important on the goban.
The cut and the two blocking moves are bigger. Furthermore, the one with sente can hit at the head of two stones, k16 for white, k17 for black.]
;W[qm]C[S6 being useless, it's therefore useless to answer it :)]

(;B[qh]C[Is Black shy? ^^ 
He must keep his territory, not reduct it himself. R10 is stronger.]
;W[np];B[nq];W[op];B[oq];W[kq]C[Hmmm... I think the upper part of the board is more important. A move like J17 seems big to me.]
;B[ic];W[jd]C[Was this a vulgar move? (Reason for thinking this: Black can expand his territory while attacking).

yeah, i'm not sure it's a good move. Of course, White will be cut off, and with all the black stones around him... Hard times are coming for White if he wants to rescue his stone. 
However, Black's moyo is very big, and something has to be done.
I would have simply reducted it, and the tengen seems reaaly enjoyable for doing it, here. But we're in handicap game, so maybe you have to go deeper, like K12?]
;B[jc];W[md];B[me];W[je]
(;B[le]C[No. Bad style. Always avoid empty angle.];W[jg]
(;B[gd]C[No. There is just one move, for me.];W[pc]C[White is letting Black an second chance.]
;B[qd];W[qc];B[nd];W[mc];B[lh]C[Even worse than before, because you're stronger than before. The strenght has no use for making territory, his only interest lies in the attack.]
;W[ji]C[White is nearly out of danger. Very bad result for Black. His moyo is in ruins.]
;B[mj];W[jk];B[hg]C[At this point black could cut the one point jump, but he didn't. Was this wise?

I think yes. There is a proverb saying : don't cut a tobi (one point jump)! 
It is because, generally, it don't lead anywhere. Of course, there is 1% of tobis which must be cut ^^ But in such a case, you have to read out carefully the sequences.]
;W[ll];B[nl]C[here, Black is just helping white to protect his weak point. The cut would have been better. Now or rather before.]
;W[ol];B[ok]C[Again, bad style.];W[nm];B[hj];W[hl]
(;B[gl];W[gm];B[fl];W[ii];B[hi];W[ig];B[hf];W[ie];B[hd]C[Useless, unless i'm mistaken. Black cannot be cut. 
Fortunately for White, Black is answering passively to all his moves. Maybe he didn't want to win anymore ^^ It's important to show yourself strong. If your opponent is taking a big point, threatening a few more points, it's better to do the same thing, rather than answer his move.]
;W[cc]C[White invades as black's potential territory looks big.

It is, indeed, at this stage of the game.];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec]

;B[el];W[dm];B[df];W[rm];B[sn];W[sm];B[ro];W[sh]C[This move was a minor mistake.

Yes ^^

Furthermore, A5/A6 and E1/E2 are sente moves for both sides.
If you play A5, for example, it's normally worth 4 points. But it's sente here, so you have to x2, 8 points. And White have E1 just after...]
;B[sg];W[qj];B[si]C[White is lucky Black play this move. Now, it is time to play the two moves I spoke about. And close with T10 after.]

Lol, untill now, i didn't see it neither... Must have been a bad surprise for Black ^^]
