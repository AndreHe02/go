C[To whoever will review for me, thank you in advance.  I don't really have too many questions about this game, but I know I could have played better.  I have been trying to learn some joseki, but so far I haven't done so well.  I hope that I can get some advice about good joseki for opening.

;W[hq];B[hp];W[dm];B[cl];W[dl]C[I'm pretty sure I didn't get this joseki right.]
;B[cn]C[DC: Hi My name is Dylan Carter, I am currently trying to break 1d. The best move here is to play at D9, following the principle of staying ahead. The stone also workd well with D/Q16 stones. And when black pushes through one can live on the inside.]

(;W[ep]C[DC: pushing from the strong side is not advisable here. wedging at J/G4 is more active.]
;B[eq];W[fo];B[gq];W[ek];B[dj];W[qn]C[DC: The result is unfavourable for white somewhat after excahnging E9 for D10 fourth line territory. and black also has fourth line on the lowerside. White is behind.]
;B[qk];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[oq]C[I thought there was a way to punish your opponent if he played this move, as it happened to me once.  I tried, but it didn't work.  What did I do wrong?
DC :The punnishment is a subtle decent at S3. leaving P4 and S4 miai.]

The game is quite interesting and demonstates how assesing the lead and what one needs to do is so important. Estimating is one of the most important factors in Go, and can lead to some very good play.]
