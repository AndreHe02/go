C[Dear Reviewer,

I played Black in this game, and I lost by a big margin. My main problem is the opening and the middle game. Quite early in the game White took the lead, and looking at the game afterwards I could not identify where I went worng. Could you help please?

Thanks, Avi.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[ce]C[I could of course also approach at C16, but C15 seems to me simple and safe.]
;W[qf];B[nd];W[jc]C[I think this is OK - do you prefer O17 here?

Blqcks potential along the upper side is not so big, therefore I think O17 is simpler]
;B[lc]C[This seem to me required; If I played O17, I could tenuki here

janr:  Blacks move is a really small extension.
I would prefer to tenuki anyway.  White k17 is not so near that it is an immediate threat .

If you want to play locally, I would prefer to take the corner (s16 e.g.), as this attacks the stone on the right side.]
;W[rd];B[qc]C[janr: Blacks stones feel overconcentrated now]
;W[qi];B[cc]C[Aiming to gaint territory and press on the White stones]
;W[hd];B[qn]C[janr:  It is probably better to play the kakari at F3.  The bottom side is the largest open area.]
;W[kq];B[qk]C[I would play c6 to avoid a white double-wing formation, and to develop the left side, which is now the widest untouched area]
;W[nq];B[or];W[cj];B[ch]C[Up to this point I felt OK; White has 3 weak group - H16, R14 and O3 while Black groups are stable.

janr: I would not consider any white group "weak".  They all have a "base" and can easily live (there is only the weak spot at G17).

janr; the last black move is again very solid and a bit slow.  the black groups are indeed safe but have little potential to gain more territory while white can take a large moyo on the bottom left, and black will have to destroy a good part of it to stay in the game.]
;W[ej]C[No White starts building a big moyo in the bottom right, and I did not find the best way to handle it.

janr:  Maybe white should better first perfection his moyo by playing a shimari in the bottom left before playing this "second floor" moves to develop the moyo towards the center.
the 3-3 invasion is becoming very big now and gives black an opportunity to take a fourth corner and then win by living in the center.]
;B[fq]C[Is this the correct approach? I thought cutting between the O3 group and D4 should be the line to play.

janr: yes, this move looks OK]
(;W[fp]C[This was quite a strong response, and suddenly I had to put effort to stablize my group here.

janr: I would prefer white not te strengthen black in this way.  maybe just closing off the corner gives territory and sufficient opportunity to attack? (see variation)]

(;W[fo]C[jqnr: would the variation be better ??];B[eq];W[dq]
;B[iq];W[go];B[hp]C[I am more or less OK, and White starts strengthening his group.]

(;B[pr]C[I did not want to tenuki here bcause this will be th end of the pressure on this group

janr"  Cqpturing P2 would be gote for white, so black gets two moves elsewhere.
Maybe black can consider the veriation];W[in]C[But now White entends his moyo and pressures my group]
;B[jo]C[Is this the right play? may be L5 better? (I was afraid of K4-J4 and then White cuts at H5]

[jr:E]C[Please comment on the whole sequence here, I did not like it as Black.

janr: I think it is difficult to kill white.
Black may gain a little influence, but in that case, it may be better to wait a bit to see what happens in the center.  E.g. if black first plays A-C and white would answer B-D then some inluence may make some points in the center ?

On the other hand, instead of making influence which is not guaranteed to make a lot of points, maybe white will answer big endgame moves such as E (which both protects black and reduces whites eyespace).

Anyway, locally this kosumi looks suboptimal shape strengthening white]
;W[mo];B[nm];W[on];B[om];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[kp]C[janr:  his kind of push usually strengthens white.  It is often bigger to at least wait with these moves, to keep to option of playing e.g. the normal endgame at o1.]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[mp];B[jq];W[km]TR[eh][bi][jm]C[
janr:  I think white is alive.
I dont like whites moving out here as it may damage white's moyo without paying off.
Big alternative moves are at the marked places.];B[jm]C[L6 better?]
;W[kl];B[jl];W[kn]C[Well, White is safe; and his moyo is very big. White leads I think.]
;B[il];W[gl];B[kk]LB[pm:A]C[I though about buidling a center thickness so I starte dthis sequence, but it did not really give me much...

janr: I'm worrying about blacks cutting point around A];W[ll]
;B[lk];W[ml];B[mk];W[pm];B[ok];W[mm]TR[ok][pm]C[janr:  capturing two stones may be small compared to blacks gained thickness. 
If white wants to take two stones, he should not make the marked exchange i think (gives black more influence)


I think cutting through with white L7 did not pay off: white got one extra eye and black got a lot of influence]
;B[pl];W[pn];B[qm];W[nk];B[nj];W[nl];B[ol]C[White Group is now under pressure... -]
;W[rc]LB[pe:B][ph:A]C[But I was surprised how easy White managed to make it safe!

janr: actually, I would prefer to move to the center avoiding a black moyo there (white A  or B e.g.)]

janr: Black could try the variation];W[sb];B[qb];W[pe]
(;B[oe];W[qd];B[oc];W[of];B[nf];W[og]C[So what now?...];B[fk]
C[May be reduce White Moyo?


janr: white has a stable but not too strong group on the top left.  For the rest, everything is stable and the center will give not many points.  So I think the big "double-sente" endgame moves (b11 e.g.) are important now.

This kind of reduction gains a few points but often gives black a group that should run wway,]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[fm];B[gk];W[ee]C[Again, White 'weak' group makes itself safe and even gaining some nice territory...]

(;B[fd]C[I am not sure this was good, but what are the alternatives?

janr:  It seems that if black plays normal endgame as in the variation, he will lose by at least about komi.  Sio black has to try something more aggressive but it is difficult to see a good attack here because all groups are very solid now.]
