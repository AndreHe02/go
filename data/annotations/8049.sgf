(----
Any Comments made by Cenair983 after the review together are enclosed in "(---- ----)"
----)

(---- facepalm was very kind to lead a review of the game with me (Cenair983) and I am commenting it further.
 Many variatons that he suggested occur throughout.
 I will try to summarize the point of each variation
before the split.  All variations are labelled.
----)

(---- Discussion is throughout the review, sometimes
 separated by some moves ----)


HI! I"M PAPS ON KGS 
I'VE TRIED TO REVIEW THE BEST I CAN AS I'M NOT THAT GOOD PERHAPS SOME COMMENT ARE NOT SO ACCURATE!

YOU SEEM TO BE GOOD AT FIGHTING AND THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO GET BETTER! GO AHEAD THS WAY AND YOU'LL IMPROVE QUICKLY!

SOMETIMES YOU ARE PLAYING SOME UNNECESSARY MOVES OR OF SMALL VALUE. BE CAREFULL THEY ARE RELATIVELY EASY TO ELIMINATE AND IT WILL IMPROVE YOU LEVEL A LOT.

REVIEWING YOUR GAME AS YOU DID IS A VERY GOOD HABIT ! I'M SURE YOU WILL SOON BE STRONGER THAN 10 KYU (PRACTICE TSUMEGOS!!)

SEE YOU SOON ON kgs
