C[[mvk\] I'll put my post-game comments/questions in brackets like this.  Thank you for reviewing my game.

DC: I hope i can provide you with ideas for better direction and highlight a few important points. I found reading many problem books and using goproblems.com most helpful when I was at this level, it gives you a very good edge for play.

mvk20 [15k\]: Hello!
katrzy [15k\]: hi];B[dd]C[mvk20 [15k\]: Where are you from?]
;W[pd];B[dq]C[katrzy [15k\]: Poland
mvk20 [15k\]: What city?
katrzy [15k\]: Cracow
mvk20 [15k\]: I'm from Washington, DC, USA
mvk20 [15k\]: s your picture
mvk20 [15k\]: What's your picture? (sorry)];W[pp]C[[mvk\] At this point I sense a Chinese opening coming.  Is playing on both 4-4 points an acceptable response?

DC: Playing the empty corner follows good principles.

katrzy [15k\]: that's dali autoportrait];B[dn]C[mvk20 [15k\]: I thought Dal√≠...]

(;W[pj]C[[mvk\] Was this move okay? Or do I need to get on his side somewhere?  Like maybe C11?

DC: This move is fine for developing the potential of your two first moves. It is a matter of taste if you play like this, or try to counter blacks strategy with a move around K3. C11 is not the most open area at this stage in the game.]

(;B[dj]C[DC: Too Flat K16 and K4 are 'Deep' Moves]
(;W[jd]C[[mvk\] How about this one?

DC: Black has made a shimaru on the bottom and it is best to play a move around K3 to counter the direction in which the shimaru is acting/exerting influence. It is fine as a large point however.]

(;B[hd]C[DC: Too small. Black should play positively and approach O3 fully utilising his fuseki.]

(;W[mc]C[[mvk\] I've never seen a response like this before, but it seemed okay to me.  I suppose there is something better.

DC: K4 Would be a good point to control more of the board, see variation. White can handle an invasion around N17.]
;B[jp]C[katrzy [15k\]: and you're probably anime fan like most of the go players
katrzy [15k\]: :)
mvk20 [15k\]: No, just Hikaru, not other anime.

DC: An interesting part of the board.];W[lq];B[jq];W[lo]C[katrzy [15k\]: is picture from hikaru?]
;B[jj]C[katrzy [15k\]: i haven't seen it
mvk20 [15k\]: Yes.  The first part, when he wasn't a good player...]
;W[cc]C[[mvk\] I thought I needed to get into his side there somewhere, and knew I could make this live.  I'm not sure it was a good idea, though.  If you can tell me what might be better, that would be great.  I'm really not sure about 3-3 invasions - when to make them, when should I guard against them in my own sphere of influence, etc.  Any suggestions would be helpful.

DC: Good timing by White];B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[ac];W[ab];B[be];W[fc];B[fd]C[DC: Capture first then find out blacks plan, After all Capturing a stone fo free cant be bad. G17 is far too submissive.]

(;W[gc];B[gd]C[DC: Black has fixed his shape somewhat.];W[hc]
;B[qc]C[[mvk\] Same question here.  Should I have guarded against this earlier, or should I welcome this?  How did I do with the response?]
;W[qd]C[DC: Correct direction.];B[pc];W[oc];B[rd];W[re];B[sd]

(;W[se]C[DC: Simply protecting the cutting point with R14 is best.]
;B[rb];W[qf]TR[se][rb]C[DC: Black is nearly alive and has sente, making the marked exchange for the endgame point @ T15 very bad see var.]
;B[ob];W[nb];B[oa];W[na];B[pb];W[jf]C[DC: A good point to expand your moyo.]
;B[if];W[ig];B[jg]
(;W[ie]C[DC: Usually when Crosscut extend J12 seems to work well for white.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[ge];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ki];W[li];B[lj];W[mi]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[km];W[mm];B[qq]C[[mvk\] Same question here.

DC: White should take the initiative and attack the stringy black wall in the centre repairing his own integrity.]

(;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[rp];W[ro];B[sp];W[so]C[DC: Simply playing R6 then tennuki is best.]
;B[rr];W[pr];B[qr];W[or];B[sq];W[gq]C[[mvk\] I knew I was losing at this point, and was looking for an open area to invade, to see what would happen.  I think I probably should have never let it get to this point, so any earlier suggestions you have would be welcome.  Was this a good invasion? This did end up working well, but maybe he could have defended better.

DC: I think you will have got he idea about exchanging endgame points for sente by now a cut at R5 would be really bad for white. Capturing E16 is absolutely sente and for free, black is not very clever with his play there and has too many weaknesses. As for invading see the the var starting @C3 from earlier.]

;B[en];W[ep];B[fq];W[eq];B[er]C[[mvk\] Here I figure I've got him.  I'm just trying to run into his territory as much as possible, then play defensively.]
;W[ml];B[id];W[je];B[ic];W[hb];B[jc];W[kc];B[ed];W[kb];B[dp]
;W[do];B[co];W[gs]C[[mvk\] I cannot imagine what ghost of stupidity possessed my brain at this instant...

DC: I have seen 6d* players make mistakes like this we all do it, best to laugh it off, I know I allways do.]

;B[bh];W[ib];B[jb];W[ja];B[fb];W[gb]C[[mvk\] Would E19 instead here work?

DC: D18 is fine reading problem books will help with this kind of situation. End of Comments]
