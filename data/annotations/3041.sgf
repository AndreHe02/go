AB[dd][dp][pd][pp]C[This is a game where I play black and lose by a slim margin. I feel disappointed that not only did I not kill something, but I gained little profit otherwise from my attacking of weak white groups.
I have read that handicap games encourage whole board play but all my fourth line stones seemed so tactically vulnerable.  White would invade on the third line and I didn't know how to use my outward facing walls in the context of this game.
Also my opening seems unsatisfactory so please suggest both alternative moves and general principles I should keep in mind.]

[pp]C[Is K4 okay? I wanted to put white under pressure and expand lower left.

**Yes, this is good because it is an extension from the corner and it does put pressure on white as you said]
;W[fd];B[df];W[jc]
(;B[gp]LB[cj:A]C[** Here it's better to play at because it an extension from the lower left corner and helps with the defects in blacks shape on the upper left. (see variation)]
;W[ch]C[** Good move by white; this exploites the blacks stones' weakness.]

(;B[ck]TR[ch]LB[eg:A]C[Similar idea to K4 but I later lose this stone.

** The problem with this move is that it forces white to play at A. By doing so weakens the upper left corner. Basically it forces white to attack your own groupe therefore black should not play this way. If black wants to attack the marked stone he has to first strenghten his position. Attacking the white groupe at the top would be a good strategy I think. ( see variation )]

(;B[os]LB[nl:A]C[It seems like I gave up the corner in exchange for connecting to the heavy N2 group although this wasn't my intetnion from the beginning, the N2 group just kept weighing on my mind.

**Yes the N2 groupe was a burden but I think It can live without connecting at the moment so it's not necessary to do so immediatly. Black should instead develope the side while attacking white( see variation)]
