C[Hi Nicolai,
This is an interesting game and I hope you enjoy the comments. Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
Paul];B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[qp]C[I would be happy about some general comments on the opening and middle game, whereever you see mistakes or good moves]
;B[eq];W[cj]C[In my experience it is most common to see white play against the open corner in the top left. Also, I have read that it is generally not a good idea to let your opponent have two corner enclosures.

When the D17 stone is on the star point playing at C10 is probably the standard way to continue.

This all being said I don't think that this move is bad and I'm sure that the outcome of games with this opening will depend on the relative strengths of the two players.]
;B[ce];W[oq];B[jc];W[pj]C[There are certainly alternatives to these plays. Black could have played on the fourth line or on the right side. White could have played at R10. I'm sure other alternatives are playable end we are only discussing personal preferences here, not good and bad moves.]
;B[cl]
(;W[cg]LB[ej:A]C[Lately in this sort of position I have been playing at A instead of moving up the side. I think your move is fine but the idea behind A is to move out into the center. After that you still have moves like C13 or D8.]
;B[el];W[ej]C[neccessary?];B[di]C[black is strong here, so this attack is no overplay, right?]
;W[ci];B[jp];W[mc];B[je]C[It is hard for me to evaluate the relative potential of the right side against black's territory but it seems to me that black is ahead at this point.

I would think there are two ways to proceed
1. Build a white moyo on the right 
2. Act to limit black's territories.

Since I think black is ahead I would begin to chip away on the top or bottom.
The variations show some ideas.]
(;W[jj]SQ[ja][jb][ae][be][de][ee][fe][ge][he][ie][al][bl][fm]
[gn][ho][ip][jq][jr][js]C[felt that tengen could be a good starting point for weakening the black moyos

This is the first move that I would really criticize.

Let's look at it from both the black and white perspectives.

The black groups outline about 35 points on the top and 50 points in the bottom left.
When looked at this way it doesn't seem to me that the tengen stone does anything significant to reduce either of these counts.

From the white point of view I think the tengen stone (while nice to have) is too far away from the right side to be of much value in building a moyo for white. Black has sente and lots of invasion points.]
(;B[ik]SQ[fl][gm][hn][io]C[strong move by black though

I would have to disagree here. If we look at the marked black diagonal the J9 stone doesn't seem to add very much to black's potential territory. It also doesn't threaten the eye shape of white's left side group.

I think the biggest problem with this move is opportunity cost. Black had much better opportunities.]
;W[lq];B[jk]C[I think that it is in white's interest to abandon the tengen stone.

See the comment at move 26.]
(;W[kj];B[ll]C[i felt that white is in trouble now, since the down left side is made into territory for black]
;W[mj]C[I think that the exchange of the last four moves favors black.

From white's point of view I don't think they have added any territory to his count.
The influence of his three center stones is mostly lost due to the position of K15.

Black, on the other hand, has both added points below his three center stones and pushed into white's lower right quadrant to keep that from becomming big. And he retains sente.]

;B[rc];W[qf];B[pb]
(;W[ge];B[gc]C[This exchange allows black to connect his K-line stones and keep his 3rd line territory on the top left. Since there is no follow up the white stone cana be attacked in the future with a move like D13.

Playing more aggressively at E17 or J17 is now more difficult as the P16 stone can be used to isolate the O17 stones.]
;W[gj]C[I see this move as more or less dame.

As a defensive move it only helps the eye shape of the left side group a little bit and as for taking territory above it that area is open from seversl sides so it will be very hard to make much there. Also there isn't much to make there even if you get it all.

From black's perspective he can seal off the lower left which is good for him.]
;B[fk];W[fj]C[And take sente.]
(;B[me];W[ne];B[mf]
(;W[jr]C[wrong timing?

Yes. This is certainly a big point but there is a fight in the upper right that has the potential to cause real problems for you. 

I would say this is a perfect example of the proverb saying to play urgent points (O14) before big points (K2).]
;B[oe]C[This position is too complicated for me to read out and say what is the best move. But no matter what happens black should expect a very good result after white has walked away from the positon to play at K2.

The swing between a black and white move here is enormous and probably a "game over" sort of event.]
;W[nf];B[pf];W[qe]
(;B[ql]C[after this invasion, white had a really hard time & gave up in the end

Could you please show some proper reactions to blacks play, e.g. how to reduce the moyo earlier

Thank you!

Here black makes the same mistake as white's K2 move. That is he left a critical fight in mid-stream and played a big move in another part of the board.]
;W[of]C[You can now take command of this area and resolve the fight to your advantage.

You have captures several black stones, connected the two groups and brought influence to bear on the territory around the P12 point.

With this backdrop you are strong enough to attack the R8 stone.]
)
(;B[pg]C[I think this would keep up the pressure on white. If one of these groups falls the area around R8 will not matter.]
))
(;W[nf]C[I think this is better for you.

Black's N14 stone has little value while your O14 stone pulls the fangs from P16 and builds on the right side.]
))
(;B[oe]C[I think this is the time to put the cutting stone into motion but I would just move out like this.]
;W[me];B[pf];W[qe];B[ph]C[This creates a splitting attack against the white groups on either side.

Black has only one group to manage while white has two.

Let's assume everyone lives. In that case black has trashed the upper right quadrant and white's remaining territory will not add up to enough to counter that of the two black groups on the left side.]
))
(;W[oe]C[I would grab this stone to keep the positon from unraveling. It can't escape (see variation).]

))
(;W[lo]C[This might be a better continuation. It builds white's lower right and threatens to reduce black along the K-line above or below K4.]
))
(;B[qd]C[This might be one way to begin to reduce white's side.

I show several others. Each of them speaks directly to keeping white from accumulating a large moyo.]

(;B[qh])
(;B[re])
(;B[qo]))
(;W[ec];B[dd];W[db];B[cb];W[hc]C[I think this is possible as the white left side group is fairly strong and ther black K-line stones are not.]
)
(;W[ic];B[id];W[hc];B[jb];W[fc]C[This may also be possible.]
)
(;W[lp]C[This adds points on the bottom and prepares to invade between D3 and K4. It also helps the right side.]
)
(;W[bp]C[This sort of probe is possible too. I don't think black will ignore it so you can examine his response and decide how to continue afterward. You can also play at any of the other points after he responds and leave this stone for aji later on.]
))
(;W[jp]C[In this position I think I would play on the bottom side. I think that works very well with the right side influence and limits the expansion of the black group on the bottom left corner. 

The C10 stone is difficult to capture and you may even trade it for further outside moves.]
