C[Hi Laurent, my name is Greg. I've tossed in my comments and variations throughout the SGF. Please have a look. If you have any further questions or didn't understand something I said, please email me.

It looks like it was a very fun game. Very close in the end too. I think you made a lot of good decisions about where to play, but the precise location was a little too slack or slightly off. It looks like white won on endgame in the end.]

;B[cn];W[jp]TR[rd]SQ[og][qh]C[So in a moyo game, one of the easiest ways to tell what to play in the opening is the proverb "play at the border of two moyos". 

You're taking the corner at S16 is certainly big, but it doesn't realy affect white. In fact, it lets him play what he wants to play at P14.

If it were me here, I would play P13 here. It expands your influence, and diminishes white at the same time.

R12 also seems like a more active choice here.]
(;B[rd];W[of];B[dj];W[jd]TR[me]SQ[mf]C[I like the idea of N15. You're trying to isolate that stone at K16 and stop him from connecting up and becoming strong. However, I think you can be a little more forceful here.]

(;B[me];W[ee]TR[df]SQ[gd]C[Against this reduction move, indeed D14 is a good move to make a lot of solid points, but I think you miss an opportunity here. I would try and keep the stones separated once again and play on the other side.]

;B[dd];W[ge]LB[mg:C][ql:B][hq:A][dr:D]C[where to play now for black ???
(LL)

Greg: I would probably choose B here. The bottom left corner doesn't seem to be as big, and C is just too slack.]

(;B[hq];W[jq]LB[ho:B][fp:A]C[Generally, I still think A is the right choice here.]

(;B[io];W[bp];B[fg];W[jm]C[I think this is a bit of a risky move for white. I might try and cut.]

(;B[mg];W[md]C[This is an awful move for white.];B[nd];W[ld]
;B[ne];W[mb]TR[nb]C[Instead of responding at O18, I might instead jump in at R8. The timing is good for that now. White playing P18 is just no that large yet.]

(;B[nb];W[hn];B[ho];W[gm]C[I might not play G6 here and instead just play G5. No sense in letting white get another forcing move.]

(;B[gn];W[fn];B[go];W[cl]TR[cj][ck][dl][el]SQ[dk]C[this invasion is difficult for black.
(LL)

Greg: Indeed. The variations you provided are good for white. However, I think there is a very interesting move at D9 actually. See my variations. You can get a bunch of interesting results. However, I think next best would be D8. I added some variations there too.]

what to play, now ???
(LL)

Greg I think the cut at L6 is very big. As a note, K5 is the right place, but cutting with L6 gives the opponent a little less choice. My second choice at this point is definitely R8.]

(;B[ql];W[qj]TR[ol]SQ[qo]C[As I mentioned earlier, there is an exchange you should make here to get a bit more eye space.]

(;B[ol];W[qn]TR[ml]SQ[nk]C[I might try something a little more direct here. I think this is bad timing for white. Instead of just jumping out, aim to connect with O9 more directly, if you can get stronger quickly, you can aim at L6.]

(;B[mo]SQ[hb][kb][rf][rj]C[is there a better move ?
(LL)

Greg: At this point, the territory is generally settled  and groups are safe, except for white has a bunch of open second line spots at the top and on the right. They seem biggest now. H18 looks like it should end it sente, which would be sweet.]
;W[rj];B[sn];W[gb]C[This is definitely bigger. I would still play S14 now.]
