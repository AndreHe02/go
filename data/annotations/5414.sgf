C[
I'm new to online go and this was basically my first rated game other than playing two 7k/8k bots and losing to one and beating the other. I've read a lot but am fairly inexperienced otherwise.

A big fight started from a corner sequence that went awry and I don't think I dealt with it so well, so one of the main things I'd like comments on is my attacking technique (I thought I was building up influence that would be useful while chasing a weak group, but instead my opponent took a bunch of territory and the group still got away).

I ended up winning by ~25, but this was (in my impression) mostly because my opponent didn't defend one of his territories at a key juncture (otherwise, I think I was slightly behind).

Thanks for any and all comments!


>> I'll try my best  my comments begin with  >>

;B[dp];W[pd];B[pq];W[po]C[I'd read something about 3-4 facing a 4-4 being poor and that playing 5-4 immediately was a strong reply, so I tried it.

I think it's to stop black having great influence which will work with d4 and d16.]

;B[kp];W[pi];B[ok];W[mm]C[Now I had a weak group to attack, but I thought I needed a move around here first to keep it well away from linking up (to prepare for the coming attack).

black should jump out first and invade directly at R17 later.]

I don't really know proper technique with the invasion, so any comments on the following few moves would be appreciated.

>> C3 is better , i think you're right.  outside stones can link up with the rignt. 

>>but here's what i think 
With white B11. top left (black X stones) looks weak. I think that's where you should play, keeping in mind the possibilty of helping M17

My impression is that the best I can do is a ko. It does seem win a ko by threatening to cut around B or C? And also, maybe I have enough ko threats to cut at the current black move too -- see the (fanciful) variation and let me know if you think this is accurate.
