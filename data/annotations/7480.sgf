C[Hello. I am your reviewer, Jepper. If weiqi is a metaphor for war, this game would be like a war of attrition and butting heads with trenches made up of the graves of fallen soldiers ^_^. The opening stage of the game is very important and should be used to demarcate your potential territory (spread out, scatter some stones). Please consider practicing tsumego. Weiqi is an endless and rewarding journey.]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd];W[dd]C[So far so good.];B[jd];W[in]C[Does White intend to enclose the left side of the board? How about an approach around O3, R6, or R14? One possibility is White O3, Black Q6, White Q2, Black R3, White L3.]
;B[kn]C[I felt that both Black and White played too high in the opening. If anything, Black should maybe have played lower like around K4.]
;W[lp]C[It is good to consider the relationship between this move and White's previous move (J6). If White finds no easy connection between M4 and the rest of his or her stones, then he or she should be planning to live inside Black's sphere of influence.]
;B[jp]C[I prefer something like L4 rather than this.];W[jo]
;B[ko];W[kp];B[jq]C[The result of White playing M4 is clear. White's two stones (L4 and M4) are now separated from the main force. Black can easily live from this position by playing something like M2 or G3.]
;W[jr]C[N6 would have been better to rescue White's stones. This move is relatively weak against Black's stones.]
;B[kr];W[ip];B[lr];W[kq];B[lq]C[This move is quite silly. I felt that neither player was taking his or her time to look at the board carefully. White could capture with J3. Instead of M3, Black should have played at J3.]
;W[ln];B[lo];W[mp];B[iq]C[White lost the chance to capture. The shape of Black's L5 stones is awkward.]
;W[km];B[mo];W[no];B[mn];W[lm];B[np];W[mq];B[nq];W[mm];B[mr]
;W[hq];B[kp]C[This move is useless and does not affect the life or death of Black's group. Black should have played elsewhere (like Black H4, White J5, Black G3, etc.)]
;W[hp];B[nn];W[jn]C["Zoom out" and look at the whole board. Where is White's sphere of influence and where is Black's?]
;B[jm]C[This move is quite silly. White plays K8 and captures Black with shicho.]
;W[jl];B[im];W[hn]C[White should have played H7 and captured with shicho (after White H7, Black J8, White J9, etc. one will find that Black cannot escape).]
;B[kl]C[White can still capture with J8, Black H7, White G7, etc. and it will still be shicho.]
;W[ll];B[kk]C[White can still capture black with J8, etc.];W[hl]
C[This move should have been J8.];B[il];W[jk];B[ik];W[jj];B[kj]
;W[ij];B[hk];W[gk];B[hm];W[gl];B[hj];W[ii];B[ji];W[hi];B[gi]
;W[gj];B[hh];W[gm]C[Butting heads once again... -_-];B[ed]C[In general, attaching to an opponent's stone only makes those stones weaker. White could play something like D17 and take the upper left corner.]
;W[hr]C[This move is small. There are still many areas of the board that are open. "Zoom out" once again and look at the balance. White's M7 stones have "breached the gate" and are poised to lay waste to the right side.]
;B[ir];W[is];B[js];W[hs];B[eg];W[dj];B[fh];W[fi];B[gg];W[gh]
;B[ih];W[gi];B[ei];W[ej];B[ci]C[White's upper right stone is somewhat isolated from the rest but can still live.]
;W[di];B[dh];W[eh];B[bi];W[fg];B[ff];W[fh];B[dg];W[bj]C[Aondeug: They just...]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[bk];W[bl];B[aj];W[cl];B[ak];W[al];B[de];W[gf]
;B[hg];W[ge];B[fe];W[ce];B[cd];W[dc];B[cc];W[ec];B[fc]C[Very good. Black doesn't give White any breathing room.]
;W[jm]C[This move is useless at this time. If Black had stones on M9, N8, and O7, then this move would be necessary.]
;B[nk]C[White should have moved here instead of K7. In general, before you make a move, ask yourself, "If I do not play here, what will it look like if my opponent plays here?" If you wouldn't mind the position if your opponent played a particular point, then you can safely ignore it and play elsewhere. Otherwise, play the point first before your opponent does! In the case of K7, White would certainly not mind Black playing there, right? Therefore, White should have played elsewhere.]
;W[mk];B[mj]C[White shouldn't be afraid of a move like O10 in this situation. There is plenty of room to live on the right side.]
;W[nl];B[ol];W[om];B[oo]C[Capturing this stone is useless. Black should have played O7 and have been done with it.]
;W[ok];B[pl];W[nj];B[nm]C[It's a bit late for this move. White is still "holding open the gate."]
;W[lj];B[li];W[mi];B[ki];W[pk];B[pm]C[This move is not as efficient as Black R8. With R8, Black not only prevents White P7 from doing anything, but secures the lower right.]
;W[lk];B[ni]C[Black piles high the wall of corpses... ^_^];W[nk]
C[A rather silly move. There are many big points on the board (such as around N17, R14, or even R3).]
;B[mh];W[mj];B[ph]C[Black has the right idea. This move somewhat helps enclose the upper right. White can still invade at R17.]
;W[nh];B[oi];W[ng]C[White should have played M12 instead. If White M17: Black N13, White K12 captures 6 stones. Otherwise White captures with N13 if Black decides to save the 6 stones.]
;B[mg];W[pi];B[pj];W[qi];B[nf];W[qj];B[oh];W[oj];B[og]C[A good move but Black R12 would have been better since those two White stones would have been captured anyway.]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[rk]C[Better to just block at S7 instead, as White could play S7 afterwards and continue encroaching into the lower right.]
;W[rj];B[sk]C[Black should have blocked at S7 instead of playing this. White could still play S7!]
;W[sl]C[This move captures two stones but if White played S7, he or she would have captured two stones and oozed into the lower right.]
;B[rh];W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[sg]C[Wrong direction. Black should have played S14 to capture this tone.]
;W[sh]C[This would not have happened if there was some time taken to think carefully about the local position, never mind the global. White S14 would have been better.]
;B[rf];W[si];B[ri]C[This is just silly and careless. Please do not play too hastily.]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[sj]C[Capturing these stones was not necessary. White could have spent this move elsewhere.]
;B[rg];W[lc];B[le]C[Black has a good idea but perhaps approaching this stone from the side (around N17) would be better.]
;W[pe]C[A rather audacious move. Black could even play something like Q17 and be done with it. White should have played around P17 and made life with the M17 stone.]
;B[oe];W[jf]C[There is no hope for life for White in this area.]
;B[hf];W[he];B[ie];W[if];B[id]C[This move was unnecessary. Black should have played K12 instead. Even if White played J16 after Black K12, then Black would play K15 and then where would White go? The three stones are dead.]
;W[jh];B[jg];W[ig];B[lh];W[kh];B[kg];W[ih];B[ke];W[je];B[lf]
C[White L14 would have been more efficient, as it does not allow Black to play L14, White M13.]
;W[kf]
(;B[lg]C[If Black had played L14 directly, this would not have happened and Black could have salvaged a point or two.]
;W[hf]C[An unnecessary move. White should continue moving into Black's territory with moves like G17.]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[hb]C[Too timid. Black should have just played G17, White F16, Black E15.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[gc];B[fb];W[hc];B[ch]C[This move further strengthens a safe position in the wake of imminent danger in the J17 area. Black should have played something like J18 instead.]
;W[ic];B[jb];W[jc];B[kd];W[kc]C[What a turn of events! The M17 stone has been resurrected from the dead!]
;B[me]C[No use in making any more eyes here; two eyes is enough. Black should have played around O17 to block White's advance.]
;W[kb]C[White can still play something like P17 and swallow more of the board.]
;B[eb]C[Black G18 is just as secure.];W[ka];B[db];W[re];B[qe]
;W[qd];B[pf];W[ld];B[md];W[mc];B[nc];W[nb];B[mb]C[Black has to let go of this move in cases like this. White can still play P18 and Black would find that N18 was useless to begin with. Better to block at P18.]
;W[ma]C[P18 would take better advantage of Black's N17 mistake.]
;B[ob];W[na];B[oa];W[la];B[oc];W[ib]C[White could play at G18 and capture more stones.]
;B[ha];W[gb];B[ga];W[fa]C[Not necessary.];B[ea];W[ia];B[cf]
C[Black should just save his or her three stones with F19. White at C15 is dead and can no longer do anything; capturing it was unnecessary and wasteful. Think of it this way: Black loses three stones and captures one stone that is already dead and in his or her territory already. The efficiency of the capture is less than zero!]

;B[pn];W[rk]C[Unnecessary. White should have kept going into the lower right with S4.]
;B[rn];W[qn];B[qo];W[ro];B[sn]C[Better to Block with S4 instead. White need only play S4 himself.]
;W[so];B[rp];W[sm];B[sp];W[rn]C[This move was not necessary and only fills in White's territory (thus reducing his or her score).]

[mb][ml][pj][sk][sn]C[This game was not at all indicative of your potential as a weiqi player. There were many hasty and thoughtless moves throughout the game. Both players should focus on playing a lot (read "A LOT") of games and tsumego. There are basic techniques and positions, especially in the corners and sides of the board, that are known to almost every player and that should be reviewed well. Take your time to think about the efficiency of your moves. If you can tolerate your opponent's stone at a particular point and it does not threaten your overall position, don't worry about it and play elsewhere! Weiqi is a game about balance. Do not be afraid to give up some stones or even areas of the board in exchange for something greater. Even the greatest player of all time, Wu Qingyuan, once sacrificed over 40 points in a ko to gain the whole.]
