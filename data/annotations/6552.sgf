C[Hi! Thank you for reviewing my game. I played black. Please let me know better moves to make, please include variations. Sometimes I feel like I can't tell whether a move is too slow or solid. Protecting cutting points seems necessary but also seem gote. Again, let me know any better moves I could have made anywhere in the game.

Hi, 
I'm Marc, currently german 2k. I will do my best to answer your questions, if there is something more, you want to know, just send me a mail or ask me, while I'm on KGS. (Usernick: MaLa)
A general comment, after reviewing your game:
Your opponent overplayed very often. That's also the reason, why you felt, you would be in defense all the time. 
But you profited most times, so this was not negative. It is very hard to give an overall advice, how to improve, because this game is nearly all the time only about punishing strange overplays. ;) But I will try to do my best. Also look at the final comment, I will write another short summary there.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[fc];W[ec]TR[jd][di]C[M: this move is considered as bad, when there is no white stone near the marked places]
;B[fd];W[hd]LB[cf:A][df:B]C[M: strange move, without a white stone at A or B]
;B[de]C[Strange move by white, is this a good move?

M: correct response];W[ce];B[df];W[cf]
(;B[cc]LB[dd:B][hd:A]C[Perhaps I could have pushed again to D13; and perhaps could have gone to C13 but that seems like it may have been overplay. Is going to the 3-3 destroying aji or a good way to punish white for his strange play?

---
Pushing would be better here. This way, you strengthen the stones at B, which results with A in place in a weak black group.]

(;B[eb]LB[eb:A]C[Perhaps I should atari other direction?

No, it's to late now.];W[ed];B[ff]C[This move seemed too slow but I didn't want my stones to be too easily divided.
---
correct move, as the proverb says "urgent moves before big moves" 
A cut would be severe (but is still possible)]
(;W[fb]LB[fb:A]C[tenuki would be better];B[gb];W[db];B[fa];W[cb]
C[Lost move, tenuki would be bigger

But the whole sequence starting with F18 was bad, white did not gain that much, while blacks wall got incredible strong]

(;B[fq]C[Is this a good move to tenuki to? Perhaps the situation in the top left is still unresolved. A move by white at D13 would be strong, and allow him to push up to the forth line. I wasn't sure where to tenuki at this point, if I should have had at all.

---
correct, D13 was more urgent]

As a wall, It would have helped me a lot in the center, but letting them die gives white power in the middle.

---
saving them was nearly impossible, at least not without losing something else]
;B[jd];W[fd];B[fb]C[I would tenuki instead here. Then it is still Ko. Later, when there are no other big moves, this gets big. But here it is (in my opinion) to early.]

(;B[fo]C[After white's last move, I wasn't sure where to next go to. I wasn't sure if this move was too slow. I think A cut by white in the bottom right could be dangerous, and if the four stones at D6 are captured white could have a lot  more territory. Was this move good, or was there a better place to move?

correct idea];W[je]C[Perhaps I should have protected the cut, but it seemed like the three stones were not too important.

they were important, but blacks move at bottom was also good]

---
correct];B[pc];W[ne];B[og]TR[of]C[I feel like my response to white's desperate invasion was very sub-optimal. What is a better sequence for capturing white, and do you have any tips?

---
I like your direction. Would have played one above (triangle) myself. The way you played, it's hard to read out, what happens, when white now plays the triangled stone. (threatens cut/running out)

Overall in this situation the direction is correct. You keep keep him from running out, while protecting the side (making points this way on the side, even when your killingattempt fails) There is not enough space to live inside, so white has to start some tricky fight, but looks bad for him.]

Barcarolle: Thank you for the game.

Thanks for reviewing my game, do you have any general tips on areas where I need improvement, or guidelines for me to get stronger, either general or specific? Thanks!
- Jeremy

You played several useless and small moves, where they were not needed. Ask yourself more often, whether you have to answer your opponents moves or not in semeai. Sometimes the opponent wastes a move, so there is no reason to do the same. Just look, if there is really a move required. On the other hand you should think more often about, what happens with cuts. You missed several times, that white was able to cut you easily. One time he noticed it and the result was fatal. There is no need to protect every cut you have and often the most solid move is not the best. Instead you have to look for moves which make the cut harder (if you cannot prevent the cut, make it hard!) and achieve something else while doing so. A good example was the missed extension in the beginning. (D13)

But generally your fighting technique was really good for your current level. 
As i said in the beginning, it's hard to say something about your general weaknesses, but I would suggest you to read something about direction of play. This is usually a topic for more advanced SDK and Dans, but i think it fits for you aswell. 
If you like, just look for me on KGS (Username: Mala) so we can discuss other questions or do a teachinggame.
