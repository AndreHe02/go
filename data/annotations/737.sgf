C[Fair move. A bit overconcentrated in the upper side however.]
;W[nc];B[pc];W[md];B[pg]C[Good. This move is quiet. Black is making territory easily]
;W[nf];B[qj];W[qm];B[kq];W[mq];B[hq];W[cj];B[cn]C[So far, both White and Black are playing quiet, letting each other to settle himself easily. This is good for Black since he's presumed to be weaker.]
;W[dl];B[en]C[Not a very good move. I can't see what Black is trying to do]
;W[fl];B[gn];W[fd];B[fc];W[ob];B[lb]LB[lc:a][qb:b]C[Black should have played Q18 because White can invade Black's corner otherwise...]

(;W[lc];B[kc];W[mb];B[ke]C[This move is not good. Invading White south east corner at San San or eroding west White Moyo would be better]
;W[kd]C[Bad move: it is Gote and doesn't give anything to White]
;B[jd];W[ld]LB[jf:a][dd:b]
(;B[jf]C[Same remark. Black should ask himself why he's playing this move. Why? Better to play either R3 or D16 (see variation)]
;W[ie];B[je];W[if];B[jh];W[gh]C[Good move];B[id]C[Bad move. Quite useless. This is a Yose move]
;W[ig];B[jg]C[Bad move. There is no real reason to answer to White move. Being cuted is not important since your upper group's live is not threatened]
;W[hd];B[hc];W[gd];B[hl]C[Too gentle];W[gm];B[hm];W[bm];B[bn]
;W[cm];B[dn]C[Bad move. If you want to insure your corner, play to San San although this is not generally a good move because it is only a defensive one. Here I think this would have been a good one however...]
;W[dq]C[White should have played at San san];B[eq]C[...And so should have done Black...]

;B[rj];W[pk];B[oj]C[There is no territory to do in the center. Better to erode White territories]
;W[pj];B[pi];W[ok];B[nj];W[oi]C[This is a stupid move. There is nothing to help with this cut. Instead, playing O9 would have given a few points to White... Anyway, both White and Black are struggling for a large Dame instead of consolidating their territories and/or eroding each other ones]
