(;W[ne]C[This move is not good. Don't try to kill black now. Better to play on O16, letting black to escape and building solid shapes on both sides]

;B[pi];W[oi];B[pg]C[Bad move. Black cannot cut the Tobi];W[ph]
;B[qh];W[pf];B[rg];W[qe]C[Bad move. White should have played S14]
;B[rh];W[rn]C[Bad move. Black is already almost alive and this does not give very much to White. Threat should come from the center (for example playing Q8) to reinforce White influence. Invading the left side is another good option.]
;B[qn];W[ro];B[re]C[Too soon. This is a Yose's beginning move. Better to play S7 if Black wanted to assure his group to get two eyes]
;W[qf]C[Don't answer and take the Sente. There are more important moves on the board.]
;B[rd]C[Both Black and White are playing a Yose sequence although the Fuseki isn't finished yet...]
;W[rc];B[rf];W[rl];B[rm]C[Black should have played S9 to get two eyes]
;W[qk];B[ql];W[rj]C[Good. This move deprives Black from his second eye]
;B[pk];W[rk];B[pj];W[sm];B[ol];W[oo]C[Good move. Both attacking Black and building on the lower side]
;B[on];W[no]C[Since the black group is alive, I think it is better to play N4 or to invade the left side]
;B[lp]LB[mm:a][mq:b]
(;W[mm]C[Bad move. Before to make Black to escape, White must deprive him from a stable basis. I think N3 is the good move]

;B[jj];W[im];B[jm];W[il];B[jl];W[kk]C[Now that his group is dead, White should use its Aji and not to try useless stones]
;B[kj];W[ij];B[jk];W[lj]C[Useless move. White has to ask himself what he's looking forward instead of letting himself struggling on a mechanical basis]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[gj];W[gi]C[What does White try to do?

You must force yourself to answer to the question: What is the goal of this stone I'm playing?]

He wanted to make some territory in the center, but since the center remained widely opened on left and low sides, it turned out bad.]
