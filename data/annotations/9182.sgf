Hiro7188 [15k\]: Good game

** Okay, I'll put my comments in here; the original request for the review was to help black, but I'm not sure who actually requested the review and there are plenty of things to look at for both black and white, so I'll comment on both sides (but maybe focus a bit more on black). Hope this is helpful!

Todd (KGS: yearofglad)];W[pp];B[dd]C[chincharra [13k\]: good game]
;W[dj];B[jq];W[jd]C[** All this seems fine. The two white stones are on the 4th line which hints at moving towards the center rather than focusing on side territory. There's plenty of room to make a base, so they could be on the 3rd line, but no difference to me.

The black stone on the 3rd line is also fine. Everything looks good!]
;B[cg];W[ch]LB[cf:2][bg:1][dg:3][bh:4][dh:6][ci:5]TR[cm][cn]
C[** Attaching to an enemy's weak stone is (generally) bad, and it comes up several times in this game on both sides. It's bad because, by white attaching, both the black and white stone have three liberties; however, it's now black's turn, so that gives black the edge in this small conflict. 

In addition, if white wants to make a base, extending the other way, to the triangle marks, also threatens the D4 stone and so is probably better.]
;B[dg]C[** This is fine, even though it doesn't remove one of white's liberties. Not a problem - working towards building a nice corner. White's approach at C12 doesn't gain white much territory and doesn't do much to make a base, either, since it's a vulnerable stone. It also lets black build a small wall to protect the corner.]
;W[qf]TR[cl][cm]C[** White probably shouldn't tenuki here. (Tenuki is basically to ignore an opponent's last move and play elsewhere.) White's group on the left-hand side isn't strong at all - in fact, by the last exchange, it's weaker than it was before white played C12. If white wants to establish a base, that's great, but playing C12, allowing black to build a small wall, and then moving away really only benefits black.

Black can invade at the marked points and put white in a lot of trouble, really cramping white's stones and taking away their potential base on the side.

That being said, it is difficult for black to ignore the white stone just played, so it isn't too bad - I just wouldn't have played it in this order. I would've approached D4, which is a move that serves two purposes - attacking black and strengthening the white stones.]
;B[nc]
(;W[gc]C[** White tenukis again - I would probably have played the variation shown, although the joseki does end with black approaching and causing trouble for white.]
;B[qh]C[** This is the "problem" with the white tenuki. R14 served two purposes - it attached Q16 and could have strengthened the right side, as in the variation. By ignoring it, it has become kind of a single-purpose stone: it's still a good attack on the corner and should still come in handy.]
;W[qc];B[qe]C[The standard joseki here is generally R16, although this is played some.]

(;W[qd]C[** If white wants to play in that direction, R16 isn't the move. S15 can connect the two white stones; R16 succeeds in white's two groups getting cut.]
;B[re];W[pe]C[** Here, black can't have it both ways - keeping all the stones alive will be tough. Nevertheless, I'd go with the variation.]

(;B[od];W[rf];B[pf];W[oe];B[ne];W[of];B[pg]C[** I think these moves are fine for black - they're all forcing moves that work to give black territory or influence on the top and strengthen the stone on the side while giving white some stones in return. Not a great exchange, but not awful for either side.]
;W[rd];B[ng]TR[kc][cl][ql][cm][qm][cn][qn][nq]C[** This is something I noticed black do a couple times. This move is played AS IF black will eventually capture the white stones, which isn't possible since white has the capture at R15/S15. So this move doesn't really do anything but cause problems (for black in the future).

Players often see moves like this and think they're ALWAYS correct, but almost every move in go needs to be examined situationally. This move doesn't work in this situation - white effectively pokes at it and causes problems for black.

In addition, there are definitely BIGGER moves to make. Imagine if the black stone was at one of the marked locations instead - the point difference between the two moves should be apparent.]
;W[nf];B[mf];W[se];B[og];W[qe];B[me]C[** The problem with this exchange, since it isn't ALL bad, is that black plays it in gote - in other words, black has to play the last move of this sequence to patch up the weaknesses created by the pseudo-capturing move at O13. White is now free to occupy one of the other big points on the board.]
;W[lc]C[** But this isn't a big point. It's not bad, but again, there are other, more pressing moves, primarily supporting the white group on the left hand side which has the potential to be a lot more cramped than the white stones on top. The white stones on top still have room to grow in either direction, while the white stones on the side can only grow in one direction, meaning if black plays there, white is in trouble.]
;B[mc]C[** Okay, this is a better example of a move that should be elsewhere because it's not a big point. This move gains black almost nothing. Sure, it puts pressure on M17, but a big part of go is prioritizing important moves. This is not an important move for this stage of the game. Again, black would do better to focus on the marked spots on the board from before - any of them are worth more.

One common "reflex" of go players is to want to respond to every move an opponent makes. Here, black is letting white dictate the area of play because black reflexively responds. If a move doesn't require a response, don't make one.]
;W[ld];B[mh]C[This move does an okay job if the goal is to connect the two groups, which isn't a bad idea. However, here, I'd connect directly at N13 rather than at N12. Your move gives white what is called a "forcing" move. White can play M13 and force black to connect, and white basically gets a free stone to work with.]

(;W[cl]C[I'd play this move at C7, but the idea is good (and long overdue) - get a base. If you can edge closer to D4, your stone will serve two purposes. Here, it leaves room for black to play a knight's move at C6 and strengthen the corner nicely. If white was at C7, then Black C6 is attaching to a weak stone and will leave black short a liberty.]
;B[cn];W[cq];B[dq];W[cp];B[co];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[fq];W[bo]
;B[bn];W[ao]C[I'm not sure I like this result for white, even though it's basically the standard joseki (although white should play A4, I think, instead of A5). Black gains a very, very strong wall that can be used to continue to attack the white group on the side, and that wall was created because of white's corner invasion. White's side group is still too weak to invade the corner.]

(;B[qn];W[pn]C[Here's another instance of attaching to a weak stone. This isn't a great idea for white - both stones at 3 liberties and black's turn. Not as bad because it's only a 1-space jump from the corner, though.]
;B[pm];W[qm];B[om];W[rn];B[qo];W[qp];B[po];W[oo]C[White here has the option of starting a ladder that black can't complete, but this move is better - it forces black into a bad, bad shape that ends up being quite problematic.]
;B[on];W[ro];B[pn];W[no];B[ql];W[rm];B[rl]CR[op]TR[nq]C[This move is unnecessary at this point - there are more important things to be doing. A nice move like O3, aiming at the cut at P4, would work well, attacking white's vulnerability and gaining potential territory for black.]
;W[mq]C[And here white effectively defends against that move. Good play for white.]
;B[ko];W[fm]CR[do]TR[en]C[I'd play this at E6, aiming at the cutting point at D5.]
;B[ge]TR[eb][ec]C[Here, protecting the corner is more important.]
;W[he]C[White attaches to black's weak stone - typically not a good idea. While it doesn't get exploited here, it will in games as you grow stronger.]
;B[gf];W[hf]C[This is a good result for black. Builds up some strength to make territory on the left side. White isn't going to be able to build a lot in the middle because black can reduce from the right. In other words, black's marked wall helps gain territor and white's doesn't really do anything (except allow black to build his wall.)]
;B[hg];W[cc]C[This is costly for black and well-timed for white.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ec];W[eb];B[fc];W[fb];B[ee];W[fd];B[ed]LB[dh:4]
[ml:1][gn:2][fo:3]TR[ec][fc]C[Even this response here is unnecessary. White's group is alive, so preventing the capture of the marked stones isn't necessary to keep white from living. (If the two marked stones' capture would provide white with a much-needed eye, then E16 would be good.) So if black lets white capture those two stones, white nets 4 points - 2 for the capture and 2 for the territory.

But look at all the other places on the board that are worth more than 4 points.]
;W[gd]LB[lg:4][fh:1][gh:2][gi:3]C[Likewise for white - not a necessary move at this point. Saves white 2 points, maybe 3.

The number 1 aims at the cut at G13, or just make that cut directly.

Lots of more valuable moves than protecting a single stone.]
;B[ef]C[This is an unnecessary move - it doesn't help black really at all. B17 is more important as far as the side is concerned.]
;W[gj]C[Here, again, I'd aim for G13 - I'd probably play it directly, but at least play G12 which aims right at it.]

(;B[jj]TR[mk][go]C[The center point (tengen) is almost never a good move. This stone is too far away from everything to make territory. Black should be focused on the bottom or right side to make territory - the tengen is a half-move in either direction.]
;W[jl];B[il]C[Here black attaches to a weak stone.];W[ik];B[im]
;W[jk];B[gl];W[fl];B[gm];W[gk];B[ki]TR[mj][mk][nk][ml]C[This move seems overly concerned with saving black's center stone - I wouldn't worry about it. This move is too slow - black still has a huge gap on the right-hand side to fill in.]

(;W[ll]C[From a solid base like this, white can make a two-space jump, or even just aim right at Q8, knowing you'll get a forcing move from black.]
;B[lk]TR[mk][nl]C[Black needs to protect the side here - this move should be focused on that.

Probably the "shoulder hit" at N9 works better.];W[mk];B[ml]
;W[lj];B[mj];W[nk]C[Here, black should punish white for not capturing M9, although the result is still very good for white.]

(;B[mi]C[This move just allows white to destroy the side. It's protecting a stone when there are far more pressing immediate matters.]
;W[mm]C[Here again, black is overly concerned with saving one stone, not noting the imminent danger to the large group.]
;B[nl];W[ol]
(;B[nm]C[This was an error in not reading ahead. Sacrifice the two stones on the 8th line and connect your group at Q8. Still not a pretty result for black.

Note that this all started with black playing too aggressively, in my opinion, and not just protecting the side.]
;W[pl]SQ[ml][nl]C[Hiro7188 [15k\]: Thank you

**

So overall, for both players:

1) Avoid attaching to weak stones.

2) Don't feel compelled to answer your opponent at every move. Sometimes it's necessary, but often in this game it wasn't. Both players at different times got in a "reflexive" mode where they played without surveying the rest of the board.

3) Related to that, it's okay to let your opponent capture stones. The object of the game is to gain the most territory, not capture the most stones. If your opponent captures 2 stones and you make 10 points of territory, which result is better.

Those two ideas (2 and 3) - allowing stones to be captured and not answering your opponent's every move - would have likely prevented black's error at the end of the game. Black appeared to be wrapped up in saving the two marked stones that he answered white's plays reflexively without noting the bigger danger that ultimately caused the resignation.

I think those are 3 pieces of advice that will really improve the game of both players and are "relatively" easy to follow - the first is pretty easy to follow, and the other 2 take practice, patience, and a change of mindset to allow your stones to be captured, which is hard to do.

I hope this helps!
