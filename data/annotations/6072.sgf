C[rs220675: Hallo! I just review White's side, black's play is not considered and evaluated. Also I focus more on the beginning of the game since in my opinion a lot of errors later are just the consequences of early fuseki and joseki mistakes. Avoid those early mistakes and you won't have the troubled situations in the middle and endgame you had.]

(;W[gq]LB[eq:A][fq:B]C[rs220675: This move is possible, but not the best. Nowadays it isn't considered joseki anymore. It is not that compact and safe like the variation move and leaves some more weaknesses at A or B. Also white will have more trouble to extend on his right side without risk. Moreover it gains hardly more like when one plays at F3 as white. This is a good example of how a small move is chosen over a slighty bigger to kill more aji (Potential) for the opponent in a later stage of the game.]
;B[cj];W[ch]LB[ic:E][ed:F][pe:A][qj:D][qn:B][nq:C]C[rs220675: Too flat and too small. There are bigger points (A-F) available. In the opening you have to try to play as big as possible.]
;B[pe];W[nq];B[pn];W[kp]C[do you think this is a good opening for white? is this even game now?

rs220675: It is a good move for white and the game is still even, maybe a slight advantage of black, but nothing to worry for White.]

(;W[jd]C[rs220675: Not a good move since it gives black more space and more chances to develop his two stones. See variation.]
;B[gd];W[hc];B[md];W[lc]LB[dc:A][fe:C][df:B][pj:D]TR[cd][ch]
C[rs220675: Again too flat. If black pushes up, white will become flat, small and black will gain a lot influence. See variation. Instead I would strengthen the two marked white stones since they are kind of weak now (at A or B) or play at C or D.]

(;W[pj]C[my second question; is this the rigt time (are we late?) and place for an invasion? eventually we afailed to produce good results from this.

rs220675: This isn't an invasion since white can live and extent easily from Q10. It's actually a very good move, because it is big and it shows a good strategical judgement. See variation for the most common mistake in this situation.]
;B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[qm]C[rs220675: Playing at P10 would be better to stay ahead of blacks two stones and avoid black's hane at P10 which favors blacks moyo and almost-territory in the right upper side.]

You should improve Fuseki and you should study joseki. When you have played a game, ask a stronger player just to look at your first 50 moves. Or you can watch and study games of stronger players - again the first 50 moves. Because mistakes there influence the flow of the further game. Therefore it's so important to focus on the beginning of a game. After you improved there you can look more on the middle and end game.]
