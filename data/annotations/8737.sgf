C[Hello!  Thank you for submitting your game for a review.  I personally find it difficult to have soneone else review my game.

Let's get down to it then.

First I want to say that I am not an authority on openings but I do  have some general ideas.  

I will do my best to focus on what I believe in important in this game and what I believe will help you in future games.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[jj];W[qg]C[This approach for white usually indicates that white does not wish to be pincered or that black is strong in the upper corner.  

This is also considerd to be not a real approach so black can ignore it.]
(;B[dj];W[mc]SQ[qf][nc]C[If the idea is to double pincer black there the stone should be one step closer.]
;B[jd];W[nf];B[pf];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[pg];W[qh];B[ph];W[qi]
;B[oe];W[nd]C[This is a good move because if black pushes either way a tiger's mouth will form.]
(;B[ne];W[me];B[of]
(;W[id]C[A contact move forces your opponent to respond immedietly (usually)

Thus it is said that contact moves make your opponenet stronger. and in this situation it may not be the best.

See variation];B[ng];W[mf];B[od];W[oc];B[rc];W[rb];B[qf];W[rd]
C[This is a gote move.  It isn't nessessary.];B[re];W[sd];B[se]
;W[sc]C[At this time black is currently alive right now.  Thus white is in trouble if black were to play severely.]
(;B[oi];W[pi];B[oj];W[qm]C[This move at R7 would be considered over play on white's part.]
(;B[cn];W[fq];B[cp];W[cq];B[bp]SQ[do]C[The important point now is at D5]
(;W[bq];B[aq];W[ar];B[ap];W[br];B[do];W[nq]C[The go proverb "Don't go fishing while your house is one fire" Comes to mind.]
;B[dq];W[ep];B[dr];W[er]
(;B[ds]C[Black can kill instead.];W[es];B[bs];W[eq];B[cs]
(;W[dh]C[What about o52?  What happened to that idea?  Currently black's group at C5 is alive with one eye and can easily get another.  Approaching it right now would not be advisable.  If white's goal is to reduce there are better ways.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[bh];W[bg];B[di];W[fh];B[eh];W[eg];B[dg];W[df]
;B[dh];W[ff];B[fi];W[gh];B[gi]C[Good choice on sacraficing the stone.  A ko would not be good for white right now because a wall in this area of the board (top left) is great for white because it is solid territory.]
;W[jp];B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[jc];B[if];W[hf];B[hh];W[hg];B[ig]
;W[jl]C[A good reducing move.];B[il];W[im];B[hl];W[en]C[Overplay by white. It can be cut.


When making jumps like this or a knight's move.  Keep in mind almost all jumps can be cut or they have cutting points.  Keep an eye on them.]

[fe][ge][he][sg][rh][sh][ri][si]C[Now I can go into detail of every mistake made but I would rather not.  It doesn't help in my opinion and at your level of 16 kyu (During this game) I believe that you will improve, if not already by the time I finish this review.

So to summarize I can give you a list of 3 things, that if followed, you will have an easier time during a game.

Steps to follow:
1) I.D and protect your own weak groups
2) I.D and attack your opponent's weak group(s)
3) I.D the biggest point on the board.

now as you progress you will be able to see what is what.  

Until then though I recommend that you keep playing! After all it is for fun and if you're not having fun then why bother?

In the meantime if you would like to study more I recommend finding some websites that deal with life and death and openings.

Now black can either choose to jump out at k14 and run those two stones to saftey or play c14 to prevent white from approaching the d10 stone.

In Either case, white gains something and risks very little.]
