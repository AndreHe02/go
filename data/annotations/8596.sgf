C[Hello Reviewer

This is a game on KGS - I recently hit 4k (on KGS), but I have never received (atleast not for a very long time) comments on my game.

So I have a feeling that I could very well be making a lot of rookie mistakes as my results often are quite inconsistent :p.

Time is 10 minutes for both sides - a game of leisure, but it felt quite interesting

And I'm white here.. But feel free to comment on black if you wish to do so..

Thanks for your work !

Hi! This is your faithful reviewer jantje.
Having browsed quickly through the game, there are a few things I want to say in advance:
- 10 min pp is blitz. From your notes I see that you like to think quite deeply about the game; this does not go together well. Blitz go is hacking / slashing with shape as the only guideline besides reading. If you want to develop strategical thinking, (also) play slow games or play on Dragon (turn-based, basically infinite time)
- Come to think of it, at least up to 1d (I can't speak for higher levels :( ) Go is "hacking / slashing with shape". Plus counting, deciding what is biggest / most important. Plus timing. Deep thoughts have little place in this set-up, as you see.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj];W[nc];B[kd];W[ic]C[What I'm thinking here is that my opponent is trying to play a heavy moyo game. So I will try to put L16 stone at risk in order to develop my upper left, while still having the possibility of use my lower O17 to either invade 3-3 or settle it in some other way if he tries to attack

Good move (j)];B[kc]C[Logical reaction, but white's following moves show a drawback. (j)]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[ng];B[ph]C[If W had started with O15, O13 and then pincered, would B have played L17? (j)]
;W[lf]LB[kf:a]C[Somehow succeeded, a rather big trade with all the 4th line stones he has though.

This move felt kinda strange, but I want to start the pressure from my potentially weakest group. J17 should have plenty of space..

Attacking from the right is OK, for exactly the reason you mention. But it must be at a, for shape considerations. Namely: dog's head is a bit slow, and a is better for intimidating B's stones L16-L17
(j)];B[kf];W[kg];B[jf];W[he];B[id]C[Not good, these exchanges help W more than B (j)]
;W[hd];B[ie];W[jg];B[ig];W[hf];B[if];W[hg]LB[gh:a]C[From shape point of view, this must be at a. (j)]
;B[ih]LB[pc:b][lh:a]C[I can no longer do much to this black group. I feel that my O15 group is safe enough - so I decide to take a big point..

Hmm. I am inclined to disagree with the 'safe enough' bit. Safe enough not to die, perhaps. But certainly not safe enough to avoid suffering if B now plays a, b as his next moves. Meanwhile B rakes in territory.
(j)];W[dj]LB[cf:a];B[le]C[Hard to understand (j)];W[mf];B[jp]
;W[pb]C[Is this early or? I don't feel like running with the white group, and he more or less has to respond. I don't get to invade 3-3 though..

Not early but a bit late.
Even thinking of invading 3-3 in this position shows fearlessness, uncommon greed, in short a complete psychological profile :-Q (j)]
;B[qc];W[hq]C[I want to make his k4 feel funny, while I give myself the opportunity of playing a nice enclosure. I can sufficiently reduce his moyo still if I get enough out of my own..

I'd go through with R18, Q17. Apart from that your move is OK.
(j)];B[do]C[He didn't want me to get the enclosure, so I try to pressure this stone to strengthen my left/upper moyo..

Good thinking (j)];W[cm];B[dm];W[dl];B[cn];W[em];B[en]C[He makes a ko - this felt rather strange to me.. I don't have much to lose even if he gets it..

Agree. (j)];W[dn];B[hc]C[This felt way too small to me, even if he were to follow up from this stone, I will get either the corner or the entire side when I defend.. atleast I think so ;)

The upper left is perhaps the biggest thing on the board, but I'd go for san-san if I were he (j)]
;W[dm];B[eo]C[It seems that he feels that this area is more urgent now that I've filled the ko as well :p]
;W[ho]C[I want to pressure his group while reducing his moyo..

My gut feeling, especially in blitz, would be to do something about the corner. (j)]
;B[gn];W[in];B[fq];W[cp];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[er];B[fr];W[kn]
C[I'm quite happy with being able to move in like this..

Have another look! Your newly minted group is weak, the corner may just be alive but not too clearly so. (j)]
;B[mq];W[qq]C[Too early? I felt that it would be enough with this though..

Never too early for san-san, the problem is rather that your outside group gets even weaker. (j)]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[qn];W[nr];B[mr];W[nq]
;B[np];W[oq];B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[cq];B[es];W[cs];B[eq];W[aq]
;B[lo];W[ln];B[mn];W[ll];B[lh];W[mh]C[Very good! If you can connect the two groups, he's welcome to your 2 stones. (j)]
;B[li];W[mi];B[lj]
(;W[mk];B[mj];W[nj];B[nk]C[OTOH, a connection that just fails may turn out to be worse than a connection not attempted. The reason is that you have helped B to attack both your groups at the same time. (j)]
;W[nl];B[ok];W[lg];B[ji]C[This wasn't necessary by him was it? - I would probably be in a lot of trouble if he had started invading now..

You are in a lot of trouble anyway. Black's move makes it harder for you to live, since O11 is not W's sente anymore. (j)]
;W[ol];B[pl];W[fc]C[I pressure H17 and make a possible 3-3 less severe..

Deep thoughts again, but if B attacks now something might just get killed... (j)]
(;B[gc]C[B has got his priorities mixed up; should attack now. See variations. (j)]
;W[fd];B[eh]C[His invasion - Felt kinda deep .. So I'm trying to at least pressure it before I decide if I should just defend..

I cannot understand why B leaves your weak group at peace here. At the very least, he would come out stronger than before and have an easier time reducing your territory. (j)]
(;W[gi]C[Hm, F11 better here?

No idea :)  
But the focus of the game should be W's weak groups. (j)];B[cc]
C[Invasion - ko for life (atleast from my viewpoint at the time)

As long as w has this weak group, B should at least not lose the ko! (j)]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[be];B[bb]C[Is it even worth playing this ko? - If I just play something like G8 and let him live maybe I'll win .. Perhaps I should have counted ;)

Make that H8 and I might even agree (j)];W[ad];B[ac];W[bc];B[od]

;W[qh];B[og]C[Your ko threats cost you quite a bit: two stones, B stronger than ever, plus he has O12 now to take away your eye. The W group is not clearly alive. (j)]
;W[bc]
(;B[ek];W[ab]C[Here I feel that I have no ko threats that are good enough, and I let the fate of the game be decided by the outcome with the black e10 group..

It is inconceivable that B should have lost this ko, with all the threats he has against the upper right and lower centre W groups (j)]

;B[jl];W[ik]C[Even at this late hour, B can put up a fight (see var) (j)]
(;B[hj];W[gm];B[hn];W[fn];B[go];W[jk]C[Hm, I want to avoid complications I guess - I feel that I'm winning.. though K5 seems tempting..

Game pretty much over at this point..

Well, if B now starts to attack in the upper right, strange things can still happen. (j)]
;B[io];W[qb]C[Exactly! Did you realize at the time how important this move is? (j)]

Ismurfin [4k\]: thx

- I must say that you are a seriously lucky fellow. The image that comes to mind is that of a sleepwalker who walks over roofs safely, without noticing any danger. 
- When playing Go, try to think stones not words.

Thanks for the opportunity to review your game. I enjoyed it. Will appreciate any feedback enormously.
