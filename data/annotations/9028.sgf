C[Dear Reviewer,

I have marked a couple of questions.
If you could point about my biggest mistakes in the game and my overall biggest weakness that would be much appreciated!

Thanks!
George

CC:: Hi -- comments might seem harsh -- they are just to the point.  you played a good game -- but you don't need me to compliment your good moves!

you should think more whole board about our attacks on groups -- find a way to chase a weak group that will benifit you -- do not induce white to strengthen his groups as that takes away the possiblity of a later attack.]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[cf];B[kc];W[db];B[fq];W[po]
;B[qo]LB[pl:A][qm:B]C[CC:: of course this is ok - but i would recommend a whole board stratagy that works with you small chinese opening... a pincer like A or B]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[nn]LB[qj:C][pn:A][nq:B]C[CC:: White is better off making a solid base on the right side with normal joseki... like White A, Black B, White C]
;B[nq];W[od];B[pf]C[CC:: Very good!];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[rb]
;W[mc];B[nf];W[me];B[ne];W[nd];B[ld];W[md]
(;B[kf]LB[id:A][lg:B]C[CC:: i don't like this move -- it doesn't contain white and it leave you with bad shape on the top

I would consider patiently protecting your weak group with A or inducing white to help you protect your group with B]
;W[mf];B[ng];W[mg];B[nh];W[mh]
(;B[pn]LB[ql:A]C[CC:: IMPORTANT! - this is a bad move -- it helps white's group acheive more stable shape... you want to keep white's group weak so that you can attack it in the future.

if you want to attack do it from a distance .. like A -- that would keep him weak and give you the potential to make a lot of points on the right side.]
;W[pm];B[on];W[om];B[oo];W[no];B[op]
(;W[nl]C[CC::  White is very hard to attack now -- and you have only gained a couple points]
;B[mm];W[nm];B[mi];W[ni]C[CC::  Overplay for white! -- he doesn't need to make such a drastic cut]
;B[li];W[kg];B[jf];W[kh];B[nj];W[oi];B[oj];W[pi];B[pj];W[qj]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[qh];W[rh];B[qg];W[rj];B[ql];W[qm];B[pl];W[rl]
(;B[lp];W[hd]
(;B[hf]C[CC:: your group has really bad shape -- i would recomend you try to make good shape so you don't have to worry about a weak group on the board..  you have plenty of points... which means you can afford to play peacefully... just settle your group and have a slow easy victory.  see variation]
;W[jd];B[kd];W[fd];B[jj]LB[ig:A][hh:C][ih:B]TR[kc][kd][ld][hf]
[jf][kf]C[CC:: you are pushing white in the wrong direction... white should obviously come out --- and when he doesn't your marked group is under severe pressure.]
;W[fo]TR[md][me][mf][kg][mg][kh][mh]C[CC:: Horrible for white! can't let marked group get surrouned]
;B[ih]C[CC:: VERY GOOD! you saws that he made a mistake and you capitalized -- white's group is practically dead... and by surrounding him you can strengthen your weak group on the top.]
;W[ff]C[CC::  another unbeleivably horrible move by white... he has to try to live his group or escape.]
;B[lb]C[CC:: good];W[mb]
(;B[oa]C[CC:: kind of works but not the ideal spot.. see variation]
;W[ob];B[pa];W[na]
(;B[qa]C[CC:  Huge misread -- White should be dead! See var.]
;W[ji];B[ii]LB[nc:A]C[my shape looks too weak

CC::  true you have many cutting point -- but luckily white is not alive yet -- he still needs a move at A -- so if you think about it you can get solid shape by surrounding him and making him play that move at A]
;W[ij];B[kj];W[ig]LB[hg:B][jg:A]TR[hf]SQ[lb][kc][kd][ld][jf]
[kf]C[CC::  here is a big mistake -- 

you have to focus on which stones are truly important -- in this case the triangle stone is worthless 

you main goal should be to connect your square stones to safety -- 

so a play at A is correct - your play at B is the wrong idea]
(;B[hg];W[if]
(;B[ie]LB[jg:A]TR[if][ig]SQ[me][mf]C[CC:  you have another chance here to see which stones are essential and white can be disgarded... a play at A would have connected your stones and]
;W[jg];B[je];W[he];B[id];W[hh]C[CC::white is happy! :(];B[ck]
;W[eq]C[CC:: wrong direction for white...];B[cn]LB[eq:A]C[CC::  don't tenuki from contact moves... you have a lot of potential on the bottom -- by ignoring the contact move at A you lose that potential]
;W[cp]C[CC: horrible!];B[ch];W[hi]
(;B[iq];W[hc];B[ic];W[cj]C[Is this a good contact play - i cannot find a way to punish

CC:: punish is not what you should be thinking -- survive is more like it-- white is very think -- you are in trouble...no doubt]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[bl];W[bi];B[ak];W[ci];B[bo]C[CC:: to small considering the score]

the difference is subtle but very important... with you original move -- white can make an eye in sente -- giving him time to try to make another eye elsewhere -- white this move white can only make one eye in gote here... this move kills white completely -- your move left him a little wiggle room]
