C[TrueOrgan [?\]: hi florian
FloFromStb: Hi Riaan, good luck
TrueOrgan [?\]: have a nice game!

Hi,

My name is Riaan Swart, I play at around 3k on kgs.  This game was played against another player from my club in South Africa in an online tournament.

I played as black.

Any comments would be most helpful!

Thanks in advance,
Riaan];B[pc]C[FloFromStb: yeah, enjoy!];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp]LB[qe:A]
[qf:B][qh:C][qi:D][qn:E]C[Well, a lot of options here...

A: Solid shimari
B: Large knight shimari 
C: Newer version of mini-china
D: Original mini-china
E: Kakari

All of which is playable, it is a matter of preference and sometimes, playing mood.]
N[Comment];B[qn]LB[qe:A][nq:B]C[[R\] Not really sure what a good approach here would be.  I sometimes play the simple shimari at A.  Any ideas on how to decide a good direction of play?

The direction is fine, approach at B is rather rare in this situation.]
;W[nq]LB[qi:A][qh:B]C[A or B is the normal play.];B[pj]N[Perfect spot to
invade]
(;W[ed]LB[gc:A][gd:B][hd:C]C[Pincer at A, B or C better, more pressure on E16.]
N[Comment];B[ic]C[[R\] I thought the long range pincer would be appropriate here and I can form a type of chinese opening.

Not quite correct, if E16 can settle comfortably, then it defeats the purpose of a pincer.

The idea of a pincer is to force the approaching stone to flee to the center and not to be able to build a foundation on the side.]
;W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[gc]LB[df:A][dg:B]C[Too comfortable for white.

A, B or tenuki, all are possible continuations for black.];B[df]
LB[bb:A]C[[R\] Is this a good move?  A is also an option as far as I know.

It is an okay move, A is yose (end-game move), to small for now.]
;W[ff]LB[qe:A]C[This is a slow move, white should play A instead, the top left group is very safe.]
;B[lc]LB[ld:A][nc:B]C[[R\] Since I felt some pressure on J17, I stabilised. Although my stones might all be too low?

Well, this is exactly why the pincer at J17 is no good, it is not placed at the right spot.

If you choose to play higer at A, white can still invade at B...]
;W[pe];B[qg];W[qc]
(;B[qd]LB[qb:A]C[[R\] I think this was the wrong choice of joseki.  R16 at A better?

Yes, R16 at A better.];W[pd];B[qe];W[qf];B[pf];W[rf];B[rc];W[qb]
;B[re]LB[oc:A][rg:B][of:C][pg:D]C[White should play A, black B and white C, black D.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[oc]LB[rb:A][oe:B][rg:C]C[As white P14 is a mistake...

Black got the option to play A sente or cut at B and start a fight.

Note that black omitted a move at C...];B[og]LB[nf:A]C[This is helping move, some call it "thank you move".

White A better for eye-shape.];W[oe];B[rb];W[pb];B[le]LB[ie:A]
C[[R\] This move necessary?  Better at A?

It is a good move.];W[ng];B[nh];W[mg];B[mh];W[lg]LB[nd:A][nf:B]
C[[R\] I thought as long as i stabilise my group afterwards that the pressure would be fine and the N13 stones wouldn't be doing much.  Is this a bad idea?

Black can play A to aim at the cut at B.];B[mb]LB[id:A][on:B]
[fq:C]C[[R\] Better at A?  Where else?

Slow move, B or C better.

O16 as suggested, or tenuki.]
(;W[ql]LB[pl:A]C[[R\] I figured that capping would not be good here, so I jumped into the corner.  Would A have been better?

Yes, A better. R8 invasion is an overplay, white S4 better, there is no need to invade at all.]
N[Why Q8 cap  is better...]
(;B[qk]C[Bad move, you make R8 stone stronger and R6 stone weaker.]
;W[pm];B[qq]C[[R\] Should I push at Q6 first?

Possible, if so you can't sacrifice R6 stone, pros and cons.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[rn];B[or];W[oq]LB[nr:A]C[[R\] I was surprised at this move? Is it not better at A?

P3 is a thick move.

O2 is possible too, as black didn't have stones around K4, the push-cut (P3 then O4) is not severe at all.]
;B[nr];W[mr];B[pq];W[mp];B[cn]LB[lq:A]C[[R\] Here was another difficult decision.  I was afraid of playing around F3 and creating a weak group... What should I have done?

For me, I will play black F3, as M3 is sente...];W[cl];B[fq]
C[[R\] Was this a good idea?

Possible move, nothing right or wrong.];W[fp]C[[R\] How to respond here?]

(;B[gp]LB[cq:A]C[[R\] Better at A?

Tough question, probably G4 is better.];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[jq]
;W[go]C[Helping move, black still got bad aji at H3... This exchange, no more aji for white.]
;B[hp];W[dn];B[cj]LB[cm:A]C[White A is honte.];W[ek]N[Why C7 is honte...]

(;B[ej]TR[cn]C[[R\] Contact with a strong stone... good idea, right?

Not quite, you should make full use of C6 stone.];W[fj];B[ei]
;W[lh]LB[ck:A][bj:B]C[Even if white want to tenuki, shd exchange A for B first.]
;B[fk]C[Nice cut, good fighting spirit.];W[dk]LB[gk:A]C[Black A will do.]
;B[gj];W[jd]C[[R\] Did not see the ladder breaker...

Well, it is just too obvious...];B[jc];W[fi];B[eh];W[fh];B[in]
C[[R\] I think white's center influence needs to be negated as soon as possible.  This a good way to do it?

Good move.];W[eg];B[dg];W[bk]LB[ci:A][lq:B][mq:C][dr:D]C[[R\] White playing endgame already... I have to respond right?

White got A as next move if you tenuki.

Possible for you to play B then D too.];B[bj]C[Too submissive.]
;W[dr]LB[lq:A][mq:B][ol:C][gs:D]C[You should play A sente, then C, big spot here.

By tenuki, you assumed that D is white's rights, it is perfectly OK.]
;B[er]C[Again, too submissive.];W[nk]LB[gk:A]C[Nice move by white, cut at A also a thick move.]
;B[fe];W[ee];B[ef];W[fg]LB[ge:A][hd:B]C[Black A, white B... Also very complicated.]
;B[he]LB[ge:A]C[[R\] Didn't know if I should have tried A directly... What do you think?]
;W[ge];B[mm]LB[lq:A][mq:B][rl:C]C[[R\] This a good reduction move?  Where else?

For me, I will play A in sente and then do a prompting move at C...]
;W[km];B[ol];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl]LB[om:A][on:B][ml:C]C[Black should play A, if white B then black C.]
;B[mk];W[nl];B[ml];W[mj]LB[kk:A]C[Black A is simple. 

White L7 still a weak stone.];B[kn]C[By attaching, you make the stone stronger and things more complicated.]
;W[ln];B[lm];W[kl];B[lj];W[nj];B[il];W[kk];B[lk];W[kj];B[li]
;W[mi];B[ki];W[ij];B[ii];W[hi];B[ji]LB[ik:A]C[White should play A here.]
;W[hj];B[jj];W[jk]LB[ik:A]C[[R\] I only now noticed that A doesn't work...

Well, if you cut, you would have win the game.

You just missed the falling pancake :)]

(;B[jf];W[jg];B[ig];W[jh];B[ih];W[kf];B[id]C[[R\] Only move I could find that works.]
;W[je];B[if];W[ke]LB[hc:A]C[Black A more efficient.];B[ie]C[This is dame (neutral point, zero).]
;W[hb];B[kb]C[[R\] Now my group is really weak though...];W[md]
LB[ld:A][ib:B][gf:C][gd:D][gg:E]C[Well, you can play A.

You can make another eye at B or C, D then E.];B[ib];W[ld]LB[lq:A]
[mq:B][ds:C][cs:D][es:E][cr:F][gm:G]C[White P11 isn't as big as you think (about 8 points gote).

White B18 or black C18 is gote 9 points yose.

You should play something like, A for B, C is sente 3 points, then G to wipe out the center area.]
;B[nm];W[on];B[oi];W[om]LB[lq:A]C[[R\] At least I protected O12 in sente.

Black should play A.];B[no];W[oo]C[Black M3 better.

Well, overall, I agree you played decently...

To improve, I suggest you study some pro games.

Hope you enjoy this review.
