C[Hello,
I am Amygdala and I am looking forward to commenting your game. I will do my very best. As I am only a low dan-player myself, my words can only serve as an inspiration, but will not be the absolute truth. I will start my comments with "A:".

dmg:
Hi there, I was playing white in this game. Thank you in advance for your advice.
I felt like I've lost a lot during the ooyose but I'll appreciate comment on any point of the game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[hq]C[dmg:
I did not wanted him to play mini-chinese.

A:
Why not? If you do not know how to deal with a certain fuseki, study it and play it as often as possible in friendship games!]
;B[fo];W[dn];B[ip];W[hp];B[ho];W[iq];B[jp];W[jq];B[kp];W[gp]
;B[go];W[fp];B[cq];W[dq];B[bp];W[bn]C[dmg: 
Correct play?

A:
Looks good enough.];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[kq]
(;W[pm]C[dmg: 
Was it too far? Black ended up with a big corner territory...

A:
It is really diffcult to find a good point here. To me, the white stone seems to stand a little near to black's thickness. I would probably play one of the variations and prefer B.]
;B[po];W[pj];B[qg];W[jc];B[ci]C[dmg: 
How to play this stone? Protecting the top or separating it from the wall?

A:
The lower white group is safe, so you can really push the black stone against it. I would have played the same move as you.]
;W[cg];B[cl]
(;W[dh]C[A:
Looks smallish. I would keep attacks on that group for a little later. Even if black solidifies the two stones, he will not get much profit there. Rather take a big point like in the variation.]
;B[dj]
(;W[je]C[A:
Feels strange and loses tempo. O17 still looks better.];B[cc]

;W[qb];B[nc];W[sd];B[oe]C[A:
Now almost the endgame begins and white might be a little behind.]

(;W[jh]C[A:
Appears promising, but in fact does hardly surround any points. It is better to hunt the black group below and build up territotry above in the course of doing so.]
;B[em];W[dm]C[dmg:
That was just for soldifying my bottom group in sente.

A:
Really protects the cutting point in the variation in sente.]

C[dmg: 
Must be the part I made the biggest mistakes.

A:
I am not sure about that. The game is often decided in the opening.]

I do not see the necessity of this one. Rather take a big point instead.]
;B[jb];W[ib];B[kb];W[ic];B[qi];W[qj];B[pi];W[lk];B[kk]
(;W[bk]C[dmg: misread.

A:
Interesting, but needs preparation. See variation.];B[bl];W[bi]
;B[bh]C[A:
Now make the best of it! See variations.]
(;W[cj];B[ch];W[ah];B[ag];W[ai];B[aj];W[af];B[bj]
(;W[ae]C[dmg:
At least, I got a seki for the top corner.

A:
You should have killed it! See variation.]
(;B[bd];W[bb]C[A:
From now on, the best you can get is a ko.];B[ba];W[ab];B[da]
;W[en]C[A:
Now black can anytime start the ko: see variation.]
(;B[eo];W[do];B[fn]C[A:
Now you can kill the lower left black group!]
(;W[kr]C[A:
Better at K2: all that matters in the endgame is to keep sente!]
;B[lr];W[jr]C[A:
Now you lose sente and black takes a big point!];B[qn];W[qm]

;B[jn];W[km];B[bc]C[dmg: 
Black is losing one point here, no?

A:
Not at all, as he has to fill in that point anyway if he starts the ko.]
;W[ea]C[A:
Even now, black can still start the ko.];B[li];W[lh];B[mi];W[ki]
;B[jj];W[ih];B[lj];W[sb]C[A:

;W[jf];B[di];W[dg];B[ml];W[oj];B[gn];W[ep];B[tt]C[dmg: 
Black's forgotten to protect at G9 here. that's why I continued.]
;W[mj];B[pl];W[oh];B[gk];W[tt];B[tt];C[Black: 67 territories - 3 prisoners = 64
White: 51 territories - 6 prisoners + 6.5 komi = 51.5
Result: B+12.5

A:
Obviously, the ko in the upper left corner was also left unplayed.
Some few remarks and recommendations in summary:

1. Prefer points at the edge to points in the center.
2. Do not be afraid of any fuseki patterns. Welcome all and try them out.
3. Do not stick to joseki blindly. Try to adapt them to the circumstances  (sequence in the upper left corner).
4. Study life and death in the corner. Do as many corner problems of all sort as possible.
5. Always try to keep sente in the endgame!

I hope you enjoyed the commentary and all that will help you to improve. Let me know about your opinion...]
