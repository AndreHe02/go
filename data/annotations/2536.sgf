C[Joe Carl: Reviewer for Black
JC: I will precede my comments as so

Hello! I have added some questions along the way. I would also be happy if you could tell me the three biggest misstake I did. I play black. Thanks!!! -Jonas

JC: Biggest Mistake #1 You answer your opponents big moves with small ones.  Look for a tit-for-tat moves rather answering his moves so directly.

JC: Biggest Mistake #2 You don't make bases and you chase your opponent into your own weak groups.

JC: Biggest Mistake #3 You try to kill stones.  Develop areas of territory first, then attack from strength instead, the fights will be much easier for you then.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc];B[pk]C[Is It better to extend to K4 or K3 here? or even further like e4?

JC: The left side is 11 spaces wide seperated by 2 black stones on the 4th line.  The bottom is also 11 spaces wide seperate by a white stone on the 4th line and black stone on the 3rd line.  So no, the right side is the biggest and it works with both your stones  K4 would be better than K3 but the bottom is not the right direction of play.]
;W[jp]
(;B[lp]C[Is M4 ok or should I have played Q5 to close the corner? Or is there a better answer?

JC: this is a small extension from you Q3 stone, only 3 spaces big.  this is small.  White did not enclose either of his cornere and they are still vulnerable, instead he took a big extension, you can do the same, and you pull slightly ahead, or you can approach one of his corners, I prefer an exension along the top]
;W[jn]
(;B[dn]C[JC: if you approach from the left side then you should treat C4 as a stone on the 3rd line.  You would play C6 not D6 then.  This kind of move is a reducing move, but there is no need.]
;W[ep]
(;B[co]C[JC: Aji keshi, this take potential away, just make a base for yourself by extending to D9]
;W[bp];B[eo]C[JC: More profit for white.  These are bad forcing moves for black.]
;W[fp];B[de]C[JC: Never start a fight and then leave your stones unsettled.]

(;W[cg]C[JC: Right idea for white, but too close.  This needs to be a double pincer.  D10 seems right for white, low is not correct.  D15 is high and can't get into the corner easily.  The black stones on the bottom are also open at the bottom.  So only 4th line is right here.]

(;B[cc]C[I didnÂ´t feel so saticfied with this. Would C9 been better?

JC: C9 is slow C11 allows you to create a base for the bottom stones and allows a cross over the top, avalance would be better if you can see how to tie the stones together.  At least then the resulting stones would work well with your stones on the right side.]

;B[bd];W[ce];B[ca];W[fc]C[JC: A horrible result for black.  Black gets 5 points inteh corner and white gets much more then that locally as well as outside thickness.]
