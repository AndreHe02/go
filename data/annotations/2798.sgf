C[z: This game was played between Zenjutsu (12k* on IGS) as black and freehold (9k* on IGS) as white.  White made a large error in the early game, giving black the UR corner.  However, black ultimately lost by letting white whittle away at black's lead, and ultimately making a fatal misplay in the end.

I would appreciate comments specific to white's upper group, black's failed invasion attempt, and suggested improvements on making bigger plays and/or plays that are more valuable defensively when holding a large lead.

Thank you, Zenjutsu];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[dq];B[ce]LB[jd:A]C[z: I've become fond of this opening, however I really don't know the "theory" of the opening.  I just like that it gives me a strong base of operations right off the bat.  I suppose better understanding some fuseki concepts wouldn't hurt.
Well... this is a strong opening. Creating a shimari and taking the coner shouldn't be bad at all. Your next aim is a point around "A" (extend from a shimari!). If you were allowed to play there, then you would have the perfect shape on the upper side.]

(;W[ic]C[of course your opponent doesn't allow a black play in this area and plays here first. Personally I prefare K17 with the same idea but i have better extentions to both sides. To explain this I give two variations.]
;B[kc];W[fc];B[nc]C[z: Okay so far?
Yes, very good!  Some people might say that the last move is slow and that you should play at a biger point like D10 or R6 or evan K3, but i like you move. Maybe those people are right but fuseki moves are often a matter of taste. if you like to play solidly this is a good move although a bit slow.]
;W[co];B[pj]C[Excelent! the best extension from the formation above. The other move you might consider is around K3 (K4) to prevent the oponent from playing there but then your oponent would take Q10 himself. Both moves are good but I prefare your's.]
;W[jp]C[Good play from your oponent!]
(;B[qm]C[This one I will critisize a bit: If you want to play in this direction, R6 is best (it attacs the corner, being an extension from Q10 at the same time). The move you played is more tight but you have so much strength above, that you don't need this tightness. The other option to consider is C10 or around it. C10 would prevent you opponent from making the perfect extansion from his formatrion below, extending from your shimari above at the same time.]
;W[qo]C[ok, he takes the corner but now you can play at C10.]
;B[qg]C[No, this is overconcentration of power. C10 is more important!]
;W[dj]C[Your opponent took the last big point (because you let him take it).]

(;B[ch]C[z: Wanted to stabilize UL stones.  However, in process, I forced W to reinforce weak stone.  Good or bad?
Not bad, because it extends from the shimari, but creating a moyo using a treat to the two white stones in the upper edge was more perspective I think. The UL stones don't need to be stabilized now. they are stable enough.]
;W[cj];B[eb]C[Now, this is bad! If you aim at the territory this move gives it is very small. If you are trying to attack the two wite stones, this is not the right direction. When you attack, you don't just attack for the attack. You attack taking some profit elsewhere (either territory or strength).]

;W[nk];B[ol];W[nm]C[z: I think this W stone is a misplay.  In this game, I was right.... but does the reviewer feel the same?
Yes, the white group needs reinforcment.];B[mf];W[lh];B[ki]

C[z: In game, I'm about 95% sure I've now captured W.
You can't be that sure! Later i give some example variations. I can't be sure thay are all correct, or that they are the best moves. but they give an idea.]

;W[lm];B[oh];W[if];B[ig]C[z: In hindsight, this stone doesn't feel real valuable.  Should be played elsewhere, right?
Yes, the K12 group was already connected to the other stones, since you can capture the L12 group anytime. so this move is a waste of time.]

;W[ib]C[z: At this point, is the W group worth attacking?  It looks like 2 eyes are a certain thing, but my life-and-death is typical of a 12k.  Does the reviewer see a means to attack the group in a meaningful way?]

(;B[pr]LB[hk:E][eo:D][gq:A][jq:C][dr:B]C[z: I thought I could make an invasion.  It's a failure.  Could the reviewer suggest an alternative method of play: either invasion, reduction, or otherwise?
One thing is certain: you need to reduce white's territory to win. This can be done by either a reduction or an invasion. I am not good at either of these but from what I know, you must be prepared to sacrifice to do this effectively. Some good ways to start are "A -D". The trouble is that white has become very strong with the L7 wall. So maybe it is safer to start reducing with "E"?]

;W[rr]C[z: My previous plays were with the intent of threatening to make 2 eyes while making strength to get to do something.  It's at this point that I asked myself "exactly what is do I mean by 'something'?"  I couldn't answer, so I just took the few points I could in sente.]
