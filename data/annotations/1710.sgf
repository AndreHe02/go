Hi Daniel,

I am 1 Dan in Belgium, but only 3k* on IGS. Therefor, you can better treat my advice with some caution, although my policy is not to tell things that I'm not sure of or else make a disclaimer. As this review will be sent to the GTL, I'm doing it in English, but any private communication following the review can obviously be done in French.

My comments are signed (dv). I added many variations and commented yours. I hope you get something out of them.

Dieter];W[nq];B[kp]C[i was told to avoid this joseki when i play at high handicap, but still wanted to learn from it

(dv) I encourage the use of any pincer because one can learn from it. Last weekend, at the Belgian Championship, I used the 2 space high pincer to the ikken takagakari to komoku, even if I know few of the variations.

In general, one learns most from agressive play. If one plays agressively, one will inevitably make mistakes, get involved in fights and play overly agressive. Reviewing those mistakes (with a better player) will learn to hold back at the right moment and how to successfully pursue an attack. Too conservative play, on the other hand, is much more difficult to adjust towards the proper degree of agression. Well, that's my opinion.]
;W[qq]C[(dv) White chooses to settle the corner. That's good news for Black: any settled position in a handicap game is one region less where things can go wrong]
;B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn];B[om]LB[np:a]
C[(dv) I think this move is OK, but it is not joseki. When the pincer is as far as L4, it is better to firmly capture the White stone at 'a'. If the pincer is one space closer and low, the keima of 12 is joseki because there the pincer already limits the potential of the white stone.

You can play this though, and be aware that the White stone still contains a lot of aji.]
;W[fq]MA[qm]C[white is leaving a weak point behind

(dv) If you suggest that White makes an overplay by not defending at the marked spot, I must object. It is true that Black has a follow-up move, but White playing there is slow, even in an even game, and it would be way too slow in a handicap game. Variation 2 shows the correct follow-up for Black.]

(;B[hq]C[guess i have to play here given moyo

(dv)

My feeling is that this pincer is too close to the Black strength. It is as if you are using your influence to build territory. I give alternatives in variation 3 and 4 and a bad idea in 5. I emphasize that this is my feeling and that it can be wrong.]
;W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[eo];W[cq]C[(dv) This is an overplay.];B[dq]
;W[cp]
(;B[do]C[(dv) You can also cut immediately. See the variation.]
;W[co]
(;B[fm]C[(dv) You should still cut. See variation];W[dm]
(;B[gn]C[(dv) You are playing too conservative in an area where you are strong. With 2 and 14 in place, 26 is unnecessary defense.]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[gk];B[fk];W[el];B[hl]LB[fj:a]C[(dv) Again, too mild. You should extend at 'a'. White's atari is no problem. Extending from a crosscut is correct but one should strengthen the weak stone, not the strong one.]
;W[df];B[fd]C[wanted to play g10 but need to answer or else difficult fight

(dv) OK. No need to invite the double kakari.];W[gj];B[ql]LB[qm:a]
[rm:b]C[do not know what to do on left side so i try to exploit white's weakness
maybe something better was to be done?

(dv) I showed earlier on that 'a' is the correct move. White can respond at 'b' and your keima leaves a weakness.]
;W[ij]LB[rm:a]C[i am surprised by no answer, thought it was sente

(dv) Well, he'd probably better answer at 'a', but your follow-up is very agressive and risky.]
;B[ro]C[is it the right continuation when no answer?

(dv) Given the location of Black 36, it is the severest continuation. But a threat must not be executed immediately. Preferably you gain more strength at the right side and top center before making this 'oki'.]
;W[qo];B[rn]
(;W[pl]C[did not expect this!

(dv) It is natural for White to cut through the keima.]
(;B[qm]C[i was afraid to cut and possibly loose 2 stones];W[pn]
;B[on];W[pm]C[bad result for black

(dv) It is interesting you call this a bad result, because for me it is not so clear. Plusses and minuses.

+ Black makes territory on the right side. White is walking on dame.
+ The White group can only make a L+1 group in gote, and thus for the moment has only one eye
-  White is out into the center
- Black's stones 44 and 12 are weakened];B[qk];W[pk];B[pj]C[(dv) Good]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[ol]LB[ph:a]C[(dv) This is tempting but useless. Black should simply stretch along the 4th line, and leave it to White to protect the cut or not. Leaving your options open, especially to cut, is very important. Moreover, this move does not strengthen the stones 12-44 in any way: before 4 liberties, after 4 liberties. See the variation.]
;W[ok];B[ph]C[(dv) very important];W[ng]LB[lj:a]C[(dv) The keima leaves a weakness. I would jump to 'a' and connect to my friends, while creating a foothold for reducing the Black moyo.]
;B[nd]LB[pf:a][cf:b]C[(dv) I would simply connect at 'a' instead. This is a bit slow, but it gives you 30 points of sure teritory. Next you either develop the upper side or you play the important (+- endgame) move of 'b'. Black's lower and White's left side roughly cancel out. So, Black's UL corner and right side make for a 50 point advantage.]
;W[cd];B[cc];W[ce]
(;B[fh]C[(dv) There is no need to go in so deep. You invite White (stronger player) to initiate a battle in an area where White is stronger, while you are ahead. That's not a good winning strategy. Moroeover, your corner needs strengthening. If his territory seems too large to you, try to compare it to yours. A quick way to do this without counting is dividing it up in squares and see if those squares would fit into your territory]
;W[ff];B[hh];W[ei]C[(dv) Very good move by White.]
(;B[he]C[(dv) The challenge in Go is to find moves that accomplish several things at one time. We amateurs often end up playing moves that accomplish none of our objectives.

This move obviously attempts to connect the invasion stones and at the same time develop at the top. However, the combined shapes of 'keima' and 'niken tobi' contain too many weaknesses to do both things, and will end up ill placed.

Two alternatives: var2 development. Var 3: connection (which I prefer)]
;W[hf];B[if];W[ge];B[hg];W[gd];B[gf];W[fe]C[(dv) This result is almost inevitable after the keima at 64  and the hane at 66. The damage to the corner is severe and not worth saving the invasion stones.]
;B[ec]C[(dv) skillful defense];W[bc];B[gc];W[hd];B[id];W[hc]
;B[cb];W[eh]C[(dv) steady but slow. White is still behind.]
;B[bb]LB[gb:a]C[(dv) This is steady but unnecessary. Black lives anyway: this move is 'miai' with a move at 'a'. Of course, you avoid losing points, but maybe more points can be gained or lost elsewhere.]
;W[dr]C[(dv) Big sente endgame move];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[mm]
C[(dv) reducing while attacking the shape of the three stones (whose natural shape extension is precisely this point).]
;B[ml];W[ll]
(;B[lm]C[(dv) Careless.];W[nl];B[mn];W[mk];B[ln]LB[ld:a][pf:b]
[qc:c]C[(dv)   This is a terrible loss for Black. White reduces his territory to 40 points and strengthens his group in sente. Now White can aim at 'a', destroying Black's development at the top, while cutting off Black's top center group. He is also strong enough now to play 'b' and there is also still sansan 'c'.

OK, it is easy enough to say what the damage is. What could have been done ? See the variation at 88: the territory gets reduced, but the White group is not that much strengthened.]
;W[qd]C[(dv) Complicated move. White has simpler attacks which also work.]
;B[qe];W[qc];B[re];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[rc];W[qb];B[rd];W[nc]
;B[oe];W[lc]C[(dv) Positional judgment:

White
LS 50
US 10
Ctr + BR 10
Weak groups: none

Black
UL 5
RS 25
BS 40

Weak group: 1 in center

So, territorially, the game is already even. Black has a weak group to take care of, so I'd put White ahead here.]
;B[fi];W[fj];B[fg];W[gb];B[fc];W[je];B[ie];W[jl]LB[eg:a][dg:b]
[ef:c]C[(dv)

White is a bit careless in not answering Black 108 after forcing with 109 and 111. In accordance with the principle of "mutual damage" in the endgame, Black should now push at 'a', threatening to either run into white territory with 'b' or cut off the White group at 'c'.]
;B[jm];W[nn];B[no];W[nm];B[oo];W[bd];B[fb];W[jh];B[jf];W[lg]
;B[il];W[kl];B[hb];W[ib];B[ga];W[ic];B[jg]C[realise my weakness]
;W[ih];B[ig];W[rp];B[hj]LB[ds:a][ps:b][og:c][rb:d][eg:e]C[(dv) There are no points here. Cutting two safe groups is dame. Connecting two safe groups also. Large points are:

a and b: 3 points reverse sente (deiri value = 2*3 = 6; see The Endgame - Ogawa and Davies)
c: about 5 points deiri
d: 3 1/2 points deiri

e: which should come first, as mentioned, because of it's menace to cut a group]
;W[hi]LB[es:a][os:b]C[(dv) Same thing: white connects two safe groups. But he has some aji against the Black group, so he will connect the troublesome push in sente now.

White a and b are both sente. If White plays both, he wins six points in sente.]
;B[hk];W[gi];B[gh];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[ke]LB[eg:a]C[(dv) all of these moves have value close to zero. Your atari however, puts an extra threat to cutting at 'a']
;W[pg];B[qg];W[pf];B[qf];W[nf]
(;B[pe];W[ne];B[od];W[kd];B[jd];W[jc];B[jj];W[ik];B[jk]C[foolish]
;W[ii];B[kg];W[lh];B[kh];W[ki];B[ab]LB[ds:a][ps:b][rb:c]C[(dv)

This move is worth 2 1/2 points. The aforementioned endgame moves a, b and c are bigger. The push has become small now, since the white group is connected.]
;W[lf];B[os]C[(dv) Good, though there is no reason not to play hane]
;W[so];B[rm]LB[sm:a]C[(dv) You can play at 'a': 1 point better. There is no aji in the cutting points (but sometimes there is, so caution is required).]
;W[oh];B[of];W[og];B[rb];W[ia];B[ra]LB[ds:a]C[(dv) This is only one point in gote. The move at the bottom is larger.]
;W[oc]LB[es:a]C[(dv) 1 point in reverse sente. 'a' is 3 points in sente]
;B[es]C[(dv) You get both large sente moves for White. This is where you eventually win the game. Quite extraordinary.]
;W[ds];B[eg];W[dg];B[ee];W[ef]C[(dv) dame !];B[de];W[kf]C[(dv) 1 1/2 point]
;B[ac]
(;W[bf]LB[ad:a][cf:b]C[(dv) Sometimes this shape is required, here it is a loss of two points. White 'a', Black cuts at 'b' and White 183 captures in a ladder. See the var.]

(dv) Black has 'a', 'b', 'c'
White has 'd', 'e', 'f' and another few at the bottom, so white will win the ko.]
;W[ke];C[won by one point!

(dv)

Congratulations. Strangely so, the difference in skill between the players vanished in the endgame. For a 1 kyu  missing the two sente moves at the bottom is strange. It is good that you took them both.

My advice to you with respect to the skills demonstrated in the game:

1. Play aggressive in areas where you are strong. Cut. 24, 26, 28, 32

2. Play conservative in areas where you are weak. Reduce gently. 60

3. Avoid aji-keshi (eliminating your future opportunities) : 52

4. Study the endgame. "The endgame" by Ogawa & Davies for the theory. Exercises: Get strong at the endgame by Richard Bozulich.

Feel free to contact me or a stronger player for additional analysis.
