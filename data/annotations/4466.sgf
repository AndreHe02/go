C[Hi, my name is James. Thank you for taking out time to review my game. I played black this game. Although I won, I feel that there were many stages where my play was far from good. I would appreciate it very much if you can help me identify my poor plays. Thank you again.


W: Hello, I'm Wouter, the reviewer of this game. I hope I can make some useful remarks for you. I will review both your moves and your opponenent's moves.]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qn];W[np];B[qk];W[kq];B[rp]C[Too early or should I leave S4 for later?

W: No, this is alright.];W[qq];B[fq]C[Did I attack from the right side? G3 vs C6

W: I think approaching from the left side would have been better, since white is already strong at the right side. But I don't think this is a serious mistake.]
;W[hq];B[cn]
(;W[cp]LB[dn:A][eo:B][fp:C]TR[cn][fq]C[W: White c3 is not so good. White should be trying to keep c6 and f3 seperated. Though it's still possible, white has wasted one move. c4 should have been at A, B or C.]
;B[en]C[Was my fuseki strategy wrong? At this point, I plan to play for big moyo and gave white solid territory. Was I correct in valuing my future moyo higher than his present territory?

W: I think your fuseki is going well. All your stones are working nicely together to form your moyo. So don't worry about white's territory. Black will make his own fair share when attacking invading stones.]

(;W[eo]LB[fo:A]C[W: this move by white is not good as the variation shows. It should be at A.]

(;B[fn]LB[fo:A]C[W: this move was not so good. It should have been at A. See variations. These variations should make clear why w-c4 is not good, since it gives black the opportunity to surround white in the corner with A.]
;W[fo];B[di];W[gn]C[W: since black didn't play f5, white played it. And now black has a nasty weakness at d6. See variation.]

(;B[dl]LB[fl:A]C[Is b-D8 the right answer to w-G6? What about w-F8?

W: I think you mean b-f8? For black, f8 would have been better, it makes black's territory larger than d8. f8 also has g7 as a nice follow up. See variation]
;W[nc]LB[fc:A][jc:C][fd:B][di:D]C[W: I think o17 should have been at A or B, since black can now make a "winged" formation if he plays C, which works nicely together with D. the other way around works less well for black since r9 is farther away from q16 than d11 is from D16. But I think this is a minor mistake by white.]
;B[lc];W[nd]LB[ne:A]C[W: this move is a bit slow. It should have been at A.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[le]TR[pb][qf]C[W: black can ignore q18 because of r14. Note that this is not the case if r14 is at q14.]
;W[qc];B[ph];W[fc];B[hc];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[ce]C[I played C15 here being very unwilling to give up much in the corner. Should I have played D15 to keep a strong shape instead for better encirclement of the Top territory?

W: This is an overplay by black. White can create havoc with d15. See variation at move 36 and 40.]

(;W[db];B[eb];W[cb];B[ec]
(;W[be]C[I thought white should have played D15 here. Can you show some variations for white D15?]
;B[cf];W[bf];B[cg];W[hg];B[jj]C[Was this move too audacious? If I don't kill of the white stones, then I'm very far behind in territory.

W: I think this is fine. Try to capture white in a big way. If white lives or escapes, you will have built a wall with k10 to make territory elsewhere.]
;W[ng]LB[kd:B][ge:A][hj:C]C[W: o13 is a horrible move. Now black plays m13 and h13 is as good as dead. Instead white should play lightly at A, B or C for instance.]
;B[lg];W[ni];B[li];W[gj]C[W: the odds are very much against white now.]
;B[gl]C[W: good idea. Once your plan is to capture white in a big way, stick to it while you can. It is said that each time you change plan, you lose 5 points.]
;W[kd];B[ld];W[kc]LB[hk:A][ik:B]C[W: L18 doesn't do much, running out with A or B is white's only chance.]

(;B[fd]LB[hk:A][ik:B]C[W: black A or B is bigger than f16. if white runs out now at A or B black looses a lot. See variations for black A instead of e16.]

(;W[ke];B[kf];W[jf];B[jg];W[if];B[id];W[je];B[ik]C[Is J19 hot/urgent? Anything better?

W: Before I played the previous variations I thought j9 was about as urgent as a move can get. Now I think it might not even be needed, but that requires some serious reading. The white stones inside black's walls are dead, just as the original game shows.]
;W[ib];B[kb];W[jb];B[lb];W[ic];B[hd];W[hb];B[gb];W[ff]
(;B[gf]LB[gh:A][ih:B]C[W: note that white still has no eyes, because k17 is a false eye. So play less risky like A or B, see variation.]
;W[gg];B[ge];W[ih]
(;B[fg]LB[fh:A]C[W: instead of f13, playing at A is better, since this move may give white a forcing move later on at A. In addition, playing at A takes away more eye space. In a way black gives white forcing moves with f13 just like g14 gave white forcing moves. Playing more lightly will kill white more easily.]
;W[ej];B[fh]TR[fg]C[W: So here black plays f12 after all, so f13 should have been at f12 in the first place, then black could play somewhere else now.]

;W[fl];B[gm];W[el]
(;B[dm]C[Was b-D7 the right play here? Should I have played J8 instead?

W: see the variation after 92, it will show D7 was very much needed]
;W[dk];B[ck];W[fm];B[dj];W[jk]TR[ik][gl][gm]SQ[ij][fm]C[How could have have played better in killing this white group. I'm sure there were many instancs where both sides made mistakes in this sequence of plays. Can you point out how I/My Opponent could have played better here?

W: Because of a few poorly placed attacks by black and a weakness in black's wall white almost gets out here by killing one of the triangled groups. Hopefully this review will make it clear what black could have done instead.
This is the review's last remark.

P.S. 
Black has done a great job at building the moyo, but he needs some more practice at playing the vital points to kill a group. Maybe life and death problems can help. In addition, black could do a bit better at sealing off his moyo.

White shouldn't be too uneasy about his opponent's moyo. Just play lightly and you're probably just fine. Critical is not to abandon stones which are inside a opponent's moyo, because that will reduce their chances of survival, as we saw with h13. So first make your invasion safe before moving on to the next invasion/reduction.]
