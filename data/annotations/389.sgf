[5k*]HA[0]KM[0.5];B[pd]C[i play black ( i'm around 6-8k) against a 6k.
as i told you in my e-mail , a commentary of the  45 first moves will be ok for me .
the rest of the game
is street fighting , so don't waste your time with it.];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]
;B[pj];W[jd];B[fq];W[dn];B[jp];W[nc];B[pf];W[ce];B[jj]C[ TT: Ok so far I think.]
;W[pn]LB[qn:A][np:B]C[ TT: You could also have considered a), although its an exception from "don't
touch what you are attacking".]
(;B[np]LB[qp:A]C[ TT: White should probably have played a) here.]
(;W[nn]LB[pl:A]C[ TT: This doesn't look so good when black plays a).]
(;B[mo]LB[pl:A]C[i think now this move is not good.
what can i play to get the pressure on white stone ?
r6  ,  r4 ?

 TT: I would prefer taking the base away with a).];W[qp];B[qq];W[qo];B[rq]
;W[ql];B[rk]C[ TT: Now he has his base.];W[mn];B[lo]LB[ok:A][pb:B][me:C]
[cl:D][cj:E]C[should i play m6

 TT: There is not so much pressure on white now, and your bottom side is   fairly solid. I would prefer one of the lettered points.]
;W[nk];B[ni]LB[lo:A]C[ TT: Now you lose sente, and the stone marked a) is more or less unnecessary.]
;W[ph]LB[pi:A]C[here's my big problem .
what's the best answer to white  28 ?

 TT: This is an illogical move - black has just defended here. And there are
 lots of other big points on the board.
 I think the way you played is not bad, but maybe a little risky. a) could be a
 safer alternative.]

(;W[qk];B[rh]C[ TT: More or less game over.];W[dj];B[cl]LB[hc:A]C[a friend told me e15 was bigger .

 TT: The extension you invade is quite narrow, and you are not really
 threatening any groups either. How about a)?];W[dl];B[dm];W[cm];B[em];W

 any funny business... [Comments end here.\]];W[io];B[hn];W[in];B[hm];W
