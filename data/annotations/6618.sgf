C[I played with black against nitro55244. In the End ist was a pretty close game. But I didn't make enough terretory. So may main aspect of this review would like to be, which moves had been better to make a greater terretory. Where have I been to hesitant? Thank you.

- Hey this is my first every review, I hope it will be helpful to you. My comments are denoted by an "-". I went through your game step by step noting alternative moves. At the end I wrote a few recommendations. To sum them up you need to work on:
 Connections between stones (connecting and splitting)
 Capturing stones
A really good book is "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go" it teaches a lot and it very nice to read. It starts out with ladders and moves on to capturing etc. It is once of most popular go books around.

- In the case you have any questions just drop me a mail.

- Sorry for all the extra variations that don't go anywhere, I don't think CGoban has the ability to delete variations.]

Remember that a very, very important thing to do is to KEEP YOUR STONES CONNECTED and to try and SEPARATE the stones of your opponent.

- I would also advise to study the capturing of stones.

- Furthermore I would say that you should play a bit more constervative with respect to the center; try to first build up a foothold and then advance towards the center. Immediately trying to stop the other from advancing is very difficult since your stones will be very weak.]
