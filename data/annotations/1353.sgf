C[Terms:
Sente-the player that ends up with the move
after an exchange has sente.  This is good as
you can lead off an exchange elsewhere.

Aji-Potential in an enemy form that you can
exploit to your advantage.  Best to leave it
until it can be used to a great affect which is
usually mid to late middle game.  It is bad to
waste aji needlessly.

Moyo-A loose enclosure of an area that can
still be invaded succesfully.  Moyos define
areas of influence.  During the opening you
create moyos and compete to make yours
bigger.

Note:  I'll be doing my stone references like
this 14-5 14 being the number across 5 being
the number up.

Main questions:
1. I maid something wrong in the joseki in the
upper left, but what ?
2. I discovered to be in a desperate position
after the joseki. Can you
please show me my main mistakes ?
3. I didn' t realize very well how did I win. Can
you please underline some
of my opponents mistakes ?];B[pc];W[qp];B[dq];W[de];B[dc];W[ec]

(;B[cc]C[This is the mistake move in the upper left
corner.  The correct move is one
above.  With a bit of reading of the resulting
position works for you.  See the variations
for whites possible avenues of attack and
your successful responses.];W[cb];B[bb];W[jc]C[This is a slack move by White.  The idea
during the opening is to spread influence over
that board as quickly as possible.  This move
is played within the influence area of the wall
to the left.  So that move doesn't extend whites
area of influence much at all if any so if you
take advantage white will begin to lag behind.];B[qe];W[do]

(;B[cm]C[I don't feel the one space pincer works here.
The white stone is putting too much pressure
on you from above.  This allows him to push
you towards the edge.  4-3 must be reinforced
some.  See variation for another option.];W[cq];B[cr];W[cp]
;B[er];W[cj];B[je]C[This move I question.  There is still a lot of
lower and right side areas to stake claims
to, your lower left group needs some help and
your stone at 3-7 might be in a bit of danger.
As white he need not even respond locally.
To make matters worse you continuation
actually ends up very badly for you with a lost
stone, loss of aji in the white shape and a
black group that has been set adrift.  An attack
on the rigth bottum corner would likely be my
choice.];W[ld]C[Answering a weak move with an
unnessecary one.  Whites objective is to
maintain connection left and can do so
without the aid of that stone.  He would be
better off sealing his lower right side
corner.];B[ic];W[id];B[jd];W[kc];B[di];W[hd];B[ci];W[fp]
(;B[fq]C[Why no one over.  Get ahead of white ensure
your not trapped in the corner play at 7-3 and
out pace white along the edge.];W[gp];B[dg];W[br];B[bs]C[Getting ahead of white at 7-3 would have
allowed this group to live much easier.  As it is
you'll be struggling for eyes in that corner and
your mid left stones get weakened by the
strenghthin of the now white corner.];W[dk];B[op];W[pn];B[qq]
;W[rq];B[pq];W[rr];B[lq];W[qj];B[em];W[fk];B[gm];W[eg]C[A wasteful move.  Tightens your left side
and gains little for white.  It also doesn't
address the weaknesses of his group in the
lower left or the mid left.  It does pose a threat
to your stones at 10-15 & 16 but they could be
used as sacrifice later or could live.];B[eh];W[ef];B[dh];W[hk]
;B[eo]C[This move undoes your good work.  White
ends up building up very strongly here and
the two groups are reconnected.  Your group
there lives yes but it should have done so any
ways without having to give up the chain you
had seperating white.];W[ep];B[dp];W[dn];B[co];W[cn];B[bo];W[eq]
;B[dr];W[bn];B[bq];W[en];B[gq];W[hp];B[hq];W[iq]C[Play out under his stone or cut, him curling
under your front edge is too powerful.];B[gh];W[ig];B[im];W[hr]

;W[mm]C[Here white shouldn't try to stop that group
from escaping]
(;B[pp]C[These stones are obviously dead.  Count
the liberties on that group of four (4) to
whites group (5).  That should tell you how
savable they are.  Check a better option in
the variation.];W[ro];B[oo];W[on];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[pr];B[rn]

;W[oi];B[ni];W[nf]C[There is still some work to be done to make
that group live.  18-9 or 18-14 might have
helped.];B[qk];W[ok];B[rj];W[qi];B[oj];W[pj]C[White mistake that group of three should be let
go and he should play at 18-11.];B[ri];W[rh];B[nl]C[This move is unnessecary.  Should white
cut your group to the side can make life and
the group in the center will make life, connect
to the left or get enough liberties to win a
liberty race against whites dead group.  It was
luck white thought his group alive.];W[jl]C[This move is trying to save 15pts while he
could be saving 40 plus points by making his
group live on the side.];B[ph];W[pg];B[rf];W[pf];B[oe];W[pe]
;B[pd];W[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[rb];W[od];B[ne];W[mf]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[nc]C[Remember your simple fundamentals,
things like ladders and nets.  Playing it this
way didn't hurt here but white can play some
forcing moves against you later and might end
up bringing that back to life.  I feel the best
way to captue here is a plain ladder.];W[ob];B[pb];W[mg];B[io]
;W[kh];B[qh]C[The white group seems quite dead here.
So either of you playing around it doesn't
make much sense.  The liberty count ends up
in your favor especially since you have that
move to use later if white presses you.];W[pi]C[White needn't bother as it is obvious that the
group is dead.  He should take advantage of
your wasted move.];B[rg]C[Another wasted move on a dead group.  Am I
missing something?  Can white live here?];W[sh]C[Waste.];B[qh]
C[Waste again.];W[ip]C[White finally realizes that the dead group is in
fact dead and moves on.  That move there
should have been yours and would have
gained you much.];B[bj];W[bk];B[dj];W[ck];B[ca];W[eb];B[fg]
;W[gf];B[ir]C[The score to here is
Black 97
White 65
35-40pts to determine in the end game.

Your main point of victory was whites
repeated mistakes on the strength of his group
that died.  That group was worth some 40 plus
pts.  If it had lived this would be the current
score
White 69
Black 56
40-45pts in end game
This is an approximation but close enough.  It
would have been a much closer game.

Whites main path to victory was the large area
he had on the top left.  As I have mentioned
some moves of yours actually contributed to
sealing up that area and making it harder for
you to attack it.  Have a look at those moves
and there result here at the end.

Thats it I think.  I would like to hear back from
you on how helpful this was for you and if you
have any questions let me know.

access to the outside, no weak group behind
enemy lines and a stronger attack on the right
side group.  As well it may look like white is
getting a strong claim to the left side but that
area has a number of weaknesses that can be
exploited later on.  This is especially not bad
considering that you would have ended up
with 3 of the 4 corners and sente while white
so far has two weak moyos and an incomplete
corner.]))
