AB[pd][dp]C[[Oripy\] Dear reviewer,
I played this game on KGS my rank on this server is about 17k.
In this game I played Black and win by only few points. I have made some obvious mistakes but I was also lucky because my opponent made mistakes too.
I'll try to point out moves where I have questions, but feel free to comment where you think this is needed.

Thanks

hello Oripy

personally i think that your constant try to "pull out" from stones the maximum of their potential is a very good attitude

yes];W[ea]
