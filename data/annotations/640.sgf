C[aga: This is the game I've played today. I've played as black, and lost. I see the only my mistake (move#193). But since I'm still not a dan player ;-), there should be other, maybe even larger mistakes. I hope you can show most severe for me, and'll gi
ve suggestions how to play in the same or similar situation next time.

aga: I've added several comments along the game. Please check if they are reasonable - if not, they can help to find my faults.]

;B[jq];W[dm];B[pj]MA[dm]LB[qj:A][ep:B][do:C]C[aga: San-ren-sei is not my favorite fuseki style, but after played joseki this point is shouting to be played.

mk: Yes, up to here your fuseki looks ok to me (well, I'm not a dan either:). I think the position looks favourable for black. It's more than a san-ren-sei, because you have stones at the lower edge, working very well with the san-ren-sei position. I thin
k white should have ommittet the marked stone (d7) and play around 'a' (r10) instead. If b plays then plays 'b' (e4) white simply answers with 'c' (d5) taking profit at the fourth line.]
;W[qf]LB[nc:A][pf:B]C[aga: Unusual approach; with wD16 more often wO17 is played against chineese opening. How should I answer this? In game I decided to build territory around top right and left buttom areas chasing w group, but result was not wonderful. Is there are better
 ways to handle this?

mk: First: there is a difference between chinese opening and san-ren-sei. A chinese opening you will find in the variation. If there is only a san-ren-sei o17 is a usual approach. What to do here, with the stones at the lower edge in position, I am not su
re of. If w plays 'a' (o17) and you simply play 'b' (q14) b would get a really impressive moyo. As pointed out at the last move, whites mistake was earlier and so the position is problematic.]

(;B[nd]LB[qe:A][pf:B]C[mk: I would start with 'a' (r15). If w answers with 'b' (q14) he is heavy. Then you play o16 and white has no easy way to build a base.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[qi];B[qj];W[lc];B[og]C[mk: very good. White can live, but he will end completly surrounded by b.]
;W[rc];B[rb];W[pb]LB[qb:A]C[aga: Another interesting w move. I don't satisfied with game sequence. Was bS18 overplay?

mk: This move is quite common especially in handicap games. If you think of the territory around p18 as yours, you will have a problem with this move. But the stones there are on the fourth line, so you should not expect that the space under these stones  turn into territory in the opening. Think of it like this: You pushed white down to the second line, while you get good influence. A superior position for black.

So s18 was ok and you should simply answer with 'a' (r18).]
;B[qd]C[mk: there is no need for an empty triangle in this position. You should play it never unless there is a very good reason to do so, e.g. if this is the only move to kill the white r14 group.]
;W[qe];B[qb];W[nb]TR[nd][pd][og][pj][qj]C[aga: And the top gone away, and w right group is safe (is it?), and my corner group is eyeless, and even w upper group is not in any danger. Although bR10 was strong move, it's the only move I've managed to play in bottom half of board.

mk: Regarding the top, see my comment to move #24. I don't know if white is dead, but he is sureley not save, as you can see in the variations. Your corner group builds with the marked stones a very nice wall and the upper white group makes points at the  second line. That means: You should be very satisfied with the position. I say it again: Your 10-20 points which you probably could have expected at the top are away. But what you got is much superior.]

(;B[qq]C[aga: So, I left my upper group and played this REALLY BIG (i think) move.

mk: ok, let's look what would have happened, if white got the corner (see variation)]

(;W[oe];B[od];W[of];B[mc];W[mb];B[mf];W[md];B[me]LB[ne:A]C[mk: why not directly 'a' (o15)?]
;W[nc];B[ne];W[ng];B[ph]LB[oh:A]C[mk: 'a' (p12) better. It threatens the same, but is more stable.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[qh];B[qg];W[rg];B[nf]LB[qg:A]C[mk: if you play 'a' (r13) you have to connect afterwards. Otherwise, there is no need to play 'a' anyway. It only lets white add another stone to his position and makes it more stable.]
;W[pg];B[oh];W[mh];B[nj]C[aga: All ok so far, my LR is huge, w's cutting group is not strong yet, and b upper group is not in serious danger yet - I can easily gain eye with bT18, and there are plenty of room to run.

mk: Quite right. However, white's cutting group is not that weak as it may look like, because of the weekness of your group. But you have an impressive moyo and so everything is quite ok.]
;W[kh]TR[ng][mh][kh]C[mk: Now you have to ask youself, what you want to do. You have a weak group, so you should not lose time and make the urgent moves, i.e. to help this group. You should not try to kill the marked white stones, because as it stands, you cannot kill them.  You can try to chase them, if you get eye-space for your own group. Everyting else makes white only stronger.]
;B[mg]LB[kf:A]C[mk: So I would play something like 'a' (l14). You read Kageyamas book 'Lessons in the fundamentals'? In this very good book, he says, the you can win a game of go by only playing very ordinary moves. Unfortunately, we poor amas always miss them :).]
;W[nh];B[lh];W[li];B[lg];W[mi];B[jf];W[ji]C[mk: You see, white is much stronger now, but you have not much more eye-space.]

(;B[kg]LB[jd:A]C[mk: I would suggest 'a' (k16) here. (see variation)]
;W[jg];B[kd];W[ld];B[le];W[je];B[ig];W[jh];B[ie];W[jd];B[id]
;W[kf];B[ke];W[if];B[jc];W[jf];B[kc];W[kb];B[jb];W[hc];B[ic]
;W[hb];B[gd];W[he]C[mk: w induces you to cut him in two. Not good.]
;B[hd];W[fc];B[fd];W[ec];B[hf];W[hg];B[gf];W[sb];B[gg];W[hh]
;B[ef];W[ee];B[eg]C[aga: I think it's a nice result: w havn't gained much terrtory on top, and w central group is not looks superstrong.

mk: White made the mistake that he tried to kill you. But there was no real chance to do so. He should better have chased you in a way that he had made territory all around. So I think too that your result is ok.]
;W[fe];B[ge];W[df];B[cc]LB[dg:A]C[aga: Doubtful invasion? I had hope to make some problems for wE17-wH18 stones, or live in corner.

mk: Yes: doubtful. White should be able to kill you, with so many stones around. 'a' (d13) looks very big.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[bc];B[bb];W[bd];B[ed];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[fa]
LB[dg:A][jo:B]C[aga: Any case it'll be the keypoint of w group, and I have some (very small) hope to escape with bH19 in case of capturing bB18 stones.

mk: Even if you had escaped, it is not time for 5-7 points gote endgame moves (you surely will not escape in sente). Still big is 'a' (d13) or 'b' (k5)]
;W[gc];B[ia];W[ha]C[aga: But result is not good. Well, I left UL corner for later (for the very end of the game)]
;B[dg]LB[cf:A]C[mk: Finally! :-) But now a followup at 'a' (c14) is not as big as before the invasion. That means that you lost points during the invasion.]
;W[ch];B[ff];W[cg];B[de]C[aga: Now I'm completely out of danger - I can create second eye with E15 and F12, and I've several dames in UR corner just for case.

mk: No more danger, right. The only danger is, that white gets too many points at the left edge. So let's count:

White has around 60 Points on the left (if you don't invade there) and probably 10 more all around the board, makes 70.

Black's only points are in the big moyo. You could probably make 70 points there, but that would give white some reducing moves from the outside, which would give him eventually some extra points. That looks like an invasion at the left is appropriate.]
;W[cf];B[ej];W[cj]C[aga: And left w position, along 3rd line, looks nice for me ;-)

mk: Third line is not very good, but ok. And now you have to show that you can make 70 points out of your moyo.]
;B[dr];W[cr];B[er];W[bq];B[ep]LB[jo:A]C[mk: 1 point sente ich *much* too small. 'a' (k5) is still big. Your moyo is quite open...]
;W[eo];B[ka]C[mk: Same comment. You only lose ko-threats.];W[lb]
;B[go]LB[jo:A]TR[nj]C[aga: VERY BIG move. Nice, I've sente to play this after all.

mk: There are not many points between g5 and  'a' (k5). But the last is better shape and closes the open door between itself and the marked stone a little bit more.]
;W[rl]C[aga: Desperation...

mk: Yes, but you have to kill this stone, otherwise you will lose.]
;B[rk];W[ok];B[oj];W[ql];B[rn];W[qk];B[pe]LB[rj:A]TR[oe][of]
C[mk: Good idea! But if w ignores it and plays 'a' (s10) You will lose. Capturing the marked stones is worth 5 points, the invasion much bigger.]
;W[pf];B[ri];W[rh];B[nk];W[ol];B[nl];W[qn];B[ro]LB[qo:A][rm:B]
C[mk: Good. 'a' (r5) instead gives white only a good sente move at 'b' (s7).]
;W[on];B[pm];W[pn];B[nm];W[op];B[mq];W[mp];B[lp];W[nq];B[mr]

;W[hj];B[il]C[aga: Yeah, my stones are splitting stones ;-)

mk: nice play. White is in big danger now.];W[ij];B[gi]LB[gl:A]
[no:B][nn:C][oo:D][np:E]C[mk: 'a' (g8) uses your splitting stones more wiseley. If white answer by adding a move to the k12 group, this group is not save and you have a good position to kill the other w group with 'b' (o5). This is sente, because after 'c' (o6) you can cut at 'd
' (p5) or 'e' (o4).];W[gk];B[gj];W[hl];B[jm]LB[im:A]C[mk: 'Do not touch what you want to attack'. This move strengthens white. 'a' (j7) much better.]
;W[jn];B[in];W[kq];B[jp];W[nr];B[kr];W[ko];B[jo];W[hm];B[im]
LB[kn:A]C[mk: 'a' (l6) better.];W[kl];B[kk];W[ns]
(;B[kn]C[aga: Well, this is the only move I'm absolutely sure of is VERY BAD move. Next w move shows it absolutely clear ;-). Was it the loosing move, or there are plenty of my other mistakes I don't see?

mk: Your judgement is correct. See variations to the previous move, which shows, that white is not able to live.]
;W[lr]TR[ns]C[aga: Ha-ha-ha ;-) really nice.

mk: Yes. The marked move was a trick play, but a relly good. I will remember it for my handicap games :)]
;B[nn];W[no];B[ln];W[ms];B[qm];W[qp];B[pq];W[mm];B[qo]C[mk: Not necessary and too small...]
;W[lm]C[mk: ... if white answer correctly.];B[oo];W[jn];B[fn]

;W[cl];B[dl];W[em];B[ek];W[fl];B[ck];W[bl];B[bk];W[bj];B[al]
;W[am];B[ak];W[bn]C[aga: Well, both w groups are alive, but b invasion to the left side looks like I'm back in game. Board territory is divided in many small pieces; the largest are wUL, wLL vs bL, bLR. So, now it's endgame time.

mk: Let's have a look at the points:
Black:
10 (L)
30 (LR)

= 40

White:
10 (LL)
25 (UL)
10 (rest)
= 45

9 prisoners each.

So, there is a small lead for white, but the game is still playable.]

C[mk: Final comments:

You lost due to a tactical miscalculation as you found out for yourself. If you want to improve, I think you should work on two things:

1st: Don't mess up influence with territory. If in the late middlegame or in the endgame someone invades the territory which you really need to win, you have to kill them. But if it happens earlier, you can normally be happy to have stones you can chase o
r to have your opponent live on the second line, whereas you get nice influence.

2nd: You should not play moves, which are much too small, even if they are sente. This only reduces aji and ko-threats you probably need later on.

Your fighting is quite well. You nearly killed white's invasion group. But again, if you are not sure that you can kill a group or that you have to kill it in order to win, don't fight for death, but make a plan what you wnat to achieve by chasing it.]

;W[nr];B[mq]C[mk: White has the corner and you have an impressive moyo. Thats ok for you. So, invading the corner around move #30 is too early. On the other hand, in the actual position it was indeed quite big, so it was definitley not a bad move. What I want to show
 you here again, is that you get something back if you opponent invades your moyos.]
