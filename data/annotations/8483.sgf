C[*syurei*: Hi!
Clem: hi];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[pp];B[cd];W[ec];B[gc];W[dc];B[cc]
;W[ee];B[qh]C[Hamaniko: This looks to me as your first weak move: Your corner encloure in the top right is a very strong formation, so you should definitely extend farther (in R10). See http://senseis.xmp.net/?ExtensionFromACornerEnclosure. Also your G17 stone looks in danger so probably something around K17 would be a dual purpose move: an extension from your encosure (though not as good as R10) and a support for G17.]
;W[gd];B[hd];W[ge];B[cf];W[eg];B[qn];W[ro];B[on];W[rn];B[rm]
;W[qo];B[pn];W[po];B[np]C[Hanamiko: good move! This is a very strong point for both players, White should have played there immediately after your P6.]
;W[oq];B[jp]C[Hanamiko: I cannot judge this move completely but I would have kept white shut with O3 instead]
;W[nq];B[op];W[pq]
(;B[oo]LB[oo:A][mp:C][mq:B]C[Hanamiko: Why? The empty triangle is an ugly shape, you should not fear the cut. (see variation)]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lp]C[Hanamiko: now white has a way out of the corner...]
;B[lo];W[kp];B[ko];W[jq];B[ip];W[iq]C[Hanamiko: You are giving white a lot of territory in the bottom, in exchange for a huge influence towards the centre: this is not bad in general, but you need to be sure that you are going to take advantage of that influence for attacking or building a framework!]
(;B[gp]LB[gp:A][hp:B]C[Hanamiko: You are playing a "pushing battle". In pushing battles it is important to "be ahead" like you are now, and "bending" the enemy line towards the direction you want him to go, but you need to be careful about the possible cutting points you leave open for white! See variation.]
;W[hq];B[gq]C[Hanamiko: Watch out! Be very carefull when your opponent "peeps" (i.e. tries to push trough a hole between your stones) because usually if you do not connect you need to be prepared for battle: try to read ahead a few moves. When you are in doubt follow the proverbs: "even a moron connects against a peep"!]
;W[hp];B[ho];W[go];B[hn];W[fo];B[dm];W[dn];B[en];W[eo];B[em]
;W[cn]C[Hanamiko: Ok, now let's consider the situation on the whole board: white has secured at least 60-70 points in the the bottom while you only have 10-15 in the upper right corner and a similar amount in the upper left. So counting "almost certain points" you are well behind but you have a HUGE amount of potential in the right side and in the center thanks to your wall facing up. The white group in the top left threatens to spoil all of your potential territory in the center. The top side is still open for battle. 

Your two stones in G17 and H16 are close to a strong white group: the points around L16-17 are waiting to be played since a long time!]

;B[gb];W[ie];B[jd];W[ck];B[dl];W[bk];B[di];W[bj];B[bi]C[Clem: I think D9 would have been better...
Hanamiko: I agree with you: you should try to keep your groups connected and to "shut" white on the edge of the board]
;W[dj];B[ci];W[dk];B[ek]C[hanamiko: Ok, now the damage is done, you cannot keep white from separating your C11 and your D7 groups: trying to block his way now only makes "squeezing out the toothpaste" http://senseis.xmp.net/?SqueezingOutTheToothpaste]
;W[ej];B[ei];W[fk];B[fl];W[el];B[fm];W[ek];B[gk];W[fi];B[df]
;W[gj];B[hk];W[eh];B[ef]C[Hanamiko: Always keep in mind where your potential territory is and try to transform it into real territory: the center/right side is not yours already, white can still enter from his groups in the left]
;W[ff];B[de];W[ed];B[kh]C[Clem: good move I think, but I wasn't able to manage white's invasion after this...
Hanamiko: I agree with again: you are now building your framework on the right! White now sees the true potential of your stones and starts to be worried but be careful, you still don't have any terriory, it is only potential.]

I suggest you to play a bit more "territory oriented", concentrating on corners first, then sides, then center, in order to gain a clear understanding of what is certainly your territory and what is potential territory. Then see examples of how to protect from reductions avoiding toothpaste situations (check on sensei library how to defend against a Monkey jump for example).
