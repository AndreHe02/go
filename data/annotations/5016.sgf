C[Hi!  I will make my comments above yours and try to answer questions as they come up. 

I think, my error are in the begin of the game in the in the 24 or 25
but where are this error?
have any ploblem whit my mode in play?];B[qp];W[dd]
(;B[ce]C[I would finish taking the corners first before attacking a white stone.  Usually the opening of the game is pretty different from the rest as far as strategy and takes a lot of practice to get good at.  A common theme is to take the corners first then the sides and then the middle. Refrain from attacking as long as possible in general.  See my variation for an idea.]
;W[fc];B[ei]TR[ai][bi][ci][di]C[Again, play corners first.  You usually want to stay around the 4th and 3rd lines to begin with on the sides.  Here, 5th line out is too far usually.]
;W[dp]
(;B[ep]TR[oq]C[Touching your opponent makes him stronger.  Avoid contact.  I would "close" off you first corner.  See variation.]
;W[eq];B[fp]C[Good];W[pd]C[Now white has claimed all three corners.  In my opinion this will be a very big improvement for you.  Just claim the corners first and you will have laid a bit of a framework for the board.]

(;B[md]C[There are other ways to protect this. Read ahead as often as possible to get a feel for things like this.  You can trap your opponent and be more active with your stones.  See variation.]
;W[qg]
(;B[ee]C[See variation for a more territory oriented move.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[ge]TR[ce][de][ee][fe]C[While this is rather large and bulky (try to space out your stones while claiming territory to capture more territory at a time), try to stay connected at all times.  Work towards your framework not away.]

(;B[gd];W[fd]C[You have been cut up, which is bad, try to avoid this.]

;B[hf];W[gg];B[hg];W[fh];B[gh];W[fg];B[fi];W[hh]C[Much of what happens here is a bit odd.  As you play more you will get a feel for what should go on.  Try for bigger moves instead of creating large bulky formations.]
;B[gi];W[dg]
(;B[di]C[This is slow, be active.];W[ch];B[ih];W[cd]TR[ce][de]
[ee][fe]C[You can see the danger of the piece you made before.  It is low on liberties.  Something more spaced out would have room to breath/live.]
;B[be];W[bd]TR[pj][qj][dl][do][oq]C[The triangled regions are all very big and can lead to larger gains than this close-quartered fighting.  Sacrifice stones early before the become cumbersome.]
;B[ae]C[Not good, play elsewhere.];W[ad];B[fb]SQ[fa][ga][ha]
[bb][cb][db][gb][hb][bc][cc][dc]C[Don't play here ever.  There is no need.  See those triangled spots from before.  This is white's territory.  Let him have it and go for bigger.]

C[In closing, you will learn just from playing how to do a bit better on those fights, but in general try to avoid fighting.  You usually lose more than you gain.  Think territorially instead of trying to kill things.  Open the game by claiming the corners and the sealing off the ones you own.  Then expand along the sides.  Only after that should fights really start ensuing at a larger scale.  You'll get there.  Hopefully this is helpful and nothing was offensive.  I'm just trying to offer advice, any of which you are free to ignore.  Have a great day!]
