C[Hi,

;W[ic];B[cn]C[Frank: Is this the right direction?  My idea was to use the ponnukis as a wall but I'm not sure if I benefitted enough from them at the end of the game.  At this point now, it seems bad for development since I'm pushing a star point, which will end up very stable, towards something that could have developed ok.

this is the right direction in my opinion, because the left side needs more support. the bottom is strong enough.]

(;B[ge]C[Frank: I guess I had delusions of..something here.  I think I wanted to get out in sente and feel comfortable with the C16 group.  It seems F15 might be a better choice though.

the C16 group is left quite small if white expands from the bottom so a move around C11 seems better]

Thanks again for the review.

basically with a better endgame the game would have been quite close]
