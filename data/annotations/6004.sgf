C[White can now get life right?

Black stopped here... Who's position is stronger now? I think mine is, because i think i have more possible territory, and the infiltration of his territory is easier.

== here again Black can shut you in, and take the outside influence.

== but let's count :)

== White's left: 49
== White's right: 14
== Black's bottom: 39

== Black will still get some points for the top right corner,
== but it's hard to say how much,
== since you can invade quite easily at R16,
== however if Black does get this corner, 
== he gets 30 extra points.

== on the other hand your position is easily invadable too 
== (at C12/C13 and D8)

== I would say it's hard to say who is winning, with the fighting still going on.]
