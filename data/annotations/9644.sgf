C[Hi,

The first time I saw your game I was surprised by the number of peeps you and your opponents played in that game. So I insisted and tried to make it clear for you why you should avoid that kind of moves. This is very important to understand in order to improve more and more.

Try to be more sensitive about aji. Do not play a forcing move if you do not have an immediate benefit by example.

It is not about reading, it is about not giving the opponent what they want. Always ask for yourself "If I were my opponent, what would I play ? What is unpleasant for me ?", and then you will have some clue about what to play/not to play.

In case your opponent has a weak group, it seems normal to let him weak all along except you can get a real profit (enclosing moyo, leaning attack, etc)

Sometimes it is hard to not play a forcing move because you feel like "If I do not play it now, it will be wasted". But That aji may be more efficient by never be directly used.

I also made some commentaries about 2 "losing moves" (to me) and stopped the game commentary at move 131.

Hope it will help you];B[qd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[de];W[dg];B[fe]
;W[gc];B[cc];W[cb];B[dj]LB[ef:1][fg:2]C[Here you decided to start a fight and it is an interesting.]

(;W[ef]C[This is a mistake I think, because I don't see a real gain for white.]
;B[ee];W[gg]LB[he:1][ff:2]
(;B[ff];W[fg];B[eh];W[eg]LB[ff:3][eg:2][fg:4][eh:1]C[So as I tried to explain it in the variation these exchanges were bad for 2 reasons in my opinion :
 1. In Tewari the sequence 1 to 4 is bad.
 2. More important : you're wasting a bunch of other opportunities and simplifying the game for white (they have less things to consider)]
;B[he];W[dl];B[gi];W[ig];B[je];W[nd]C[The game start to be complicated, I will try to avoid to come into complicated variations, trying to stay in general commentaries that will (I hope) help you to improve in your next game.]
;B[kg];W[jh];B[li];W[jj]C[Here comes the peeping festival.]
;B[ii];W[ji]LB[hg:3][hh:1][hk:2]TR[je][kg][li]C[This exchange is starting to make your marked position weaker (keima is strong for attack but leave weakness)]

(;B[hh]C[This one was the worst I think. Please have a look at previous variation for more details.

But again you wasted lot of possibilities and aji while white got stronger. Black now has to be very careful.

That kind of "thank you move" should be avoided.];W[hg];B[hk]
;W[jl];B[hm];W[if]LB[hc:2][ie:1]C[This was a bit ugly. But hard to avoid the cut. Please have a look at the var 2 for an illustration.]

(;B[lc]C[This is not a good shape. It give white a good and strong shape (tiger mouth) and still let you a cutting point. This is the same kind of move than the previous peep : you are giving White what they want whithout real direct benefit.]
;W[mc];B[ic];W[hb];B[cd];W[bb]LB[mb:C][lc:A][mc:B]C[I think it is now clear that Black C is better than A for B.]

C[Thofte [4k\]: this was a bad move, I think, because it gave white the opportunity to cut
Thofte [4k\]: maybe Q 10 is better?

Q10 does not really avoid the "cut". If I consider that position Black looks too weak to kill. So you should think at what you could gain. As the biggest place is on the right, I would try to develop it.]
;W[ph]LB[ni:1][oj:2]
(;B[ni]C[This was a direction mistake. After that white is quite happy.]
;W[pi];B[qj];W[pj];B[qk];W[pk];B[mk]LB[ni:A]C[Thofte [4k\]: white gave black the opportunity to do a splitting attack ...

Actually, the variation favors White to me because, White center/left group looks kinda easy to save. The game proved it and black was low on the rigth, got a small life in center and let White make many points at bottom.

This is the consequence of A direction and a later move.];W[ql]
;B[rl];W[qm];B[rm];W[qn];B[rn];W[qo];B[rh];W[mm];B[kk]C[Peep, but with a direct goal, so that's ok if you can't found another move.]
;W[jk];B[lm];W[ll];B[ml];W[kl]LB[kj:1][nm:2]

;W[kq]LB[in:A]C[White should play A that would be easy after that for him.]
;B[dq]C[It is good to invade and because you are in late, make it complicated is good too.]

;W[in]LB[in:C][kq:A][oq:B]C[Now we can see A is not useful. And B was better than C.]

That is not better because Black is stronger and can play a move like A while Black at top is not 100% safe (alive but a lot of possible forcing moves you don't want to let White play)]

(;B[le]LB[ke:A][kf:B]C[When you play a move like A, you usually play that move as a follow up, letting white spend some moves to capture your stones. As it would not be very interesting for you, I think the block at B move 41 was better.]

So in another words : making your group stronger outside (by simply playing elsewhere) will make that aji more and more unpleasant for white.]
