C[Thank you for commenting on my game. I'm Jeff Miller, 7.7 AGA and 8k KGS, playing black.]
;B[pd]C[BillW [8k\]: sho nuff];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[jp]
;B[fc]C[Often, I'll play at K16, but I thought I'd try something different.]
;W[hc];B[cc]C[Invading seemed natural, since I'd get sente and be able to break up the left side.]
;W[cd]TR[dj]C[wild : Wrong direction. When there isn't any white seeds in the region of D10, white should not block here.]
;B[dc];W[ed];B[fb];W[ge];B[cj]TR[cd]C[Better played at C 9?
wild : C10 looks about right. This wrong direction in blocking (C16) is exposed here with black C10.]
;W[nc];B[lc]TR[pf]SQ[pk]C[In retrospect, I'm not strong enough to play this, correct? Better the one-point jump at Q14?
 wild : Yes. The one-point jump at Q14 combines better with Q9.]
;W[ne];B[pf]
(;W[pb]C[wild : This is not the usual continuation of this play. The reason is that it does not give white space for 2 eyes (only enough for 1 eye) and at the same time, it kills off any potential invasion of the 3,3 point at R17. See variation.]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[jc]TR[ia]C[I think I got lucky here. A white move at R15 would have been devestating, correct?
wild : That one black seed is rather light. Even if white plays R15, I would probably just ignore it and play somewhere else. Just look at the situation, how many white seeds has white deployed on this top side and how much territory can it obtain here (not forgetting the gaping hole in the region of J19)?]
;W[hb];B[rb]TR[jc][lc][kf]SQ[ke]C[wild : Now that you have decided to save the marked group, you should continue with the strategy. A jump to L14 is the natural next move here. It is urgent because a white attack at L15 is severe.]
;W[ra];B[rc];W[cm];B[cg]TR[kf]C[Now I'm left with two weak groups while white is strong.

wild: Of the 2 the one at the top is more urgent. A jump to L14 would temporarily ease some pressure.]
;W[fd];B[ec]C[wild : I don't think white can do anything funny in the corner.]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]TR[rr]C[I felt this was a fair result.

wild : This is a very typical variation. However, for Chinese fuseki, to put more pressure on white, it is more common for black to play  move 39 at S2.]
;W[rr];B[rs]C[Shoud I have ignored white and played at R7?

wild : No.];W[sr];B[ej]C[Since this group is in no immediate danger, I should have continued to attack by playing at R7. I was strengthening my group so that I could invade at the 3-3

wild : Yes, you should continue with attack.];W[ql];B[qk];W[rl]
;B[rk];W[sk];B[sj]TR[kf][dq]C[wild : These are endgame moves. Ignore them. There are bigger moves to make, like L14 and D3. L14 is increasingly a very important move. Note that both white's group at the top do not have enough space for 2 eyes yet, particularly the one on the right.]
;W[sl];B[ri];W[om];B[ng]C[wild : Wrong direction. You are pushing white towards your weak group. One guiding principle to remember is to always play from your weak side and push your opponent's weak group towards your strong group.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[le];B[ke];W[lf]
(;B[id]C[wild : See variation.];W[hd];B[cq]C[Was this well timed? Or would an invasion around G4 have been more appropriate?

wild : No. The top is a lot more urgent.];W[dq];B[cp];W[co]

;B[ap];W[lq];B[mr];W[mq];B[nq];W[lr];B[ns];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb]
;B[kc];W[mc];B[if]TR[jh]C[wild : Looks slow. Can consider K12.]
;W[hf];B[jg]TR[ih]C[wild : J12 is faster.];W[hh];B[ji];W[eg]
;B[bf]TR[hj]C[wild : passive play. Can consider around H10. One, it puts white's big group under pressure to make to eyes and with that it becomes easier for black to make two eyes too. Two, it brings the whole group towards the center and more room to manuvoure.]
;W[dh];B[ch];W[di];B[dj];W[ci];B[bi];W[bk];B[bj];W[el];B[ah]
C[wild : Way too passive. Generally, it is much better to jump towards the center than to play to make two eyes.]
;W[jl]C[At this point, I'm far behind ....

wild : Yes and I think it is largely because of the overyly passive play in the last 15-20 moves beginning from move number 87 through 103.]
;B[im]TR[jm][jn]C[.... so I tried a desperate invasion.

wild : Yes, other possibilities are marked.];W[il];B[jn];W[ko]

(;B[ar]C[This was necsseary, right? or did I lose a tempo?

wild : If it was neccessary, it would have been too late, wouldn't it? This move is worth some points but it is largely an endgame move. See variation.]

C[I thought white could capture three stones starting with a throw in at n6, but I see now that the liberty at m5 rescues black. A wasted move.]

;W[hr];B[qa];W[pp];B[ra];C[Thanks for the review.

wild : In conclusion, I think you could improve a lot by doing more life-death problems. Your uncertainty in some life-death situations have resulted in quite a number of timid and slow plays that allowed white to slowly gain the upper hand in this game.]

(;W[kd]TR[kc][jc][ld][hc]SQ[jd][id][le][md]C[The usual continuation of this is bL17,wK16,bK17,wJ16,bM16,wM15,bH17,wN16.
But because of white's H17 seed, black will probably leave this area and play somewhere else first and wait for an opportunity to play here. Even when it does play here, it will probably sacrifice this stone but not after making some use of it.]
