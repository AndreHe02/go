C[Ramon,

Hi!  My name is Todd (yearofglad on IGS), and I'll be reviewing your game.  I tried to address your questions as best I could.  I also included some variations throughout the game, and tried to note those in the comments so you wouldn't miss them.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions at all.

Best of luck!];B[pd]C[pake [?\]: ha
paulus [16k?\]: hi];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq];B[pj]C[Todd: I see a lot of players playing black do this, reinforcing between their two opening stones.  I don't see a problem with it, but it's something you'll want to reconsider _if_ you keep running into situations (as you did in this game) where white creates large moyos that make you nervous.  That's the trade-off you're making with this kind of move, I think - you're trying to create a large black moyo, but know that you're also giving white the opportunity to do the same.

Kageyama says something to the effect that if your opening is making you nervous and difficult to enjoy the game, change your opening.

I'm not suggesting that's what's happening here, but just something to keep in mind if you find yourself fretting over opponents' moyos in the future.]
;W[ce];B[jc]C[Should this be om the 4th line (K16)?

Todd:  I'm not sure.  I think you can expect white to invade around N17 or O17 regardless of where you place this stone.  Considering that a white stone in either of those places will probably pinch your K17 stone a little, you may want to put it up a line to prepare to move to the center.

Ultimately, I think the move is too far away from your black stone, but that might be a personal preference and nothing more.]
;W[gc]C[Todd: This white stone prepares to squeeze your black stone at K17 even more.]
;B[do]C[Should D5 be better around C9 or C10, to deny white the pincer at D8?

Todd:  Given the possibility of the pincer, I think your C9 or C10 statement is maybe better, yes.  If white hadn't just played G17 to prepare for a moyo in the upper left, I think D5 is fine.  However...]
;W[dl];B[eq];W[er];B[ep];W[fr];B[cq];W[kp]C[Todd: This move for white is too far out.  Black J3 or H3 attacks both weak white groups while leaning on your black group in the lower left.]
;B[mq];W[hq]C[Whats the best move here, somewhere around D11 attacking D8, or build moyo with O10, or leaning attack around H5? Or maybe K15 or something else?

Todd:  Let me tackle each of your suggestions.

O10: I don't like this move.  It's a little too... "out in the middle" for my taste.  It doesn't really do much of anything, I think - both the upper right and lower right would still be open to a white invasion after O10.

K15: I feel the same way about this that I do about O10.  In fact, K15 is probably the worst of the options you presented - it invites a move like White G15, which adds to white's moyo that you're concerned about.

H5: This move doesn't really do much either.  It forces white to reinforce his lower group.  It isn't much of an attack - it doesn't put white in a tough spot.  Also, what does black gain from H5?  Not much.  H5 isn't going to be useful for building much territory, as it's out in the middle of the board.

D8: This is the right idea, but I think I'd go in around C11, maybe.  Maybe C10.  Playing a little lower allows you to threaten to undercut white's D8 - remember that most eyes are made along the edges of the board.  If you can cut a group off from the edge, it makes it much more difficult.]
;B[ho];W[ci]C[What the best way here to punish white for ignoring the attack on H12 group?
Waht is more important, attack H12 group or reduce whites moyo in upper left with...?.....D12? or E15?

Todd: You ask what the best way is to punish white for ignoring the attack on H12?  I assume you mean H3, not H12, so I'll proceed on that assumption.

I don't think you're going to kill white's lower group - the best you can do is to attack it while increasing your own territory, and I think a move like L2 or L3 does that most effectively - it strengthens your lower right while reducing white.  However, leading into your next question --

You've put yourself in a really tough spot if you want to attack white's moyo.  I agree - that moyo is something to be nervous about.  I'm not sure about the best place to attack, but D12 and E15 both seem too easy for white to take care of.  I would throw in a probing stone around C15 - maybe throw it in at C14.  See the variation on the next move.]

(;B[dr]C[Todd: This is not good.  This move is worth very little at this point - a move around N17 is far more valuable.  Also, consider R7, R13, L3, L2, and something like the variation at C14.  This move saves black a couple points, not much.]
;W[md]C[Whats best, ignore and attack H12 further and then whats the best way to do so or should I respond to N16. My thought was also playing K15, helping an inasion or reduction of whites upper left and attacking N16.

Todd:  I get the sense that you are far too intent on attacking the lower white group (again, I assume that's what you mean by H12).  You should work on N16 instead.  Here, K15 again gives white the opportunity to respond with G15, which would be big trouble, especially considering that if that happens, white can still easily invade and live at R17.  I think I would play O17, threatening to undercut white's white stone, and then, boy, I don't know.

You've really put yourself in a tough spot with the white moyo, and I don't know the best way to attack it.  I'd almost think, other than the probe around C14, that white's moyo is going to be large and you'd best work on your potentially-large right side.]
;B[iq];W[ip];B[jq];W[oc];B[pc];W[kq]
(;B[kr]C[Todd: You're letting white push you around.  Remember, just because white attacks a group doesn't mean you have to respond in kind.  I think the move at Q17 was good, but then to turn and answer white on the lower side is not as good.  A move like black N18 seems much better (see variation).]
;W[jp];B[hp];W[od];B[pe];W[je]C[What the best way to respond here (maybeG12?), or shoud I have avoided this earlier?
What to do about white K2, is this bad aji?

Todd: Yes, you should have avoided this earlier, unfortunately.  I feel like at this point you're going to have a challenge to even get K17 to survive, let alone mount much of an invastion in the upper left.  A move that threatens to split the N16/P16-17 group would be good, something like L16.  That seems a little slow, but I feel like you're going to need to escape to the middle to save K17 (and if you lose K17, white will be way ahead).

Don't worry about K2.  Yes, it needs to be cleaned up, but isn't worth nearly as much as many other moves, particularly around K17.]
;B[hc]C[Todd: This is also a good play.  I like this move.]
;W[hd];B[gd]C[Todd: I think I might have dropped down to H18 before cross-cutting.]
;W[gb];B[id];W[he];B[ie];W[oq]C[What about the next sequence, and how to play here?

Todd:  Your move here should be attached to Q4 (O4 or Q3).  You need to defend the corner because the corner is where most of the points will come from.  As to which is better, that's a tough call.  Q3 allows the white stone to separate you from your black lower middle group.  I can't tell you which is better here, but I think O3 accomplishes very little.]
;B[nq];W[op];B[pq];W[or]
(;B[no]C[Is white creating to many weak grous? If yes, how to punish this best?

Todd: Yes, white has some weak groups, but so does black.  All your groups on the bottom are weak (with the exception of the lower right), and your top middle group is weak as well.  You're in a tough spot - I feel like at this point white is winning.  Black needs to come up with creative ways to attack white while solidfying some of his groups.  I've put in a few moves in the variations.

You could punish white if you had stronger groups.  However, white's weak groups are as strong or stronger than yours - you're playing from behind in this situation.]
;W[lr];B[hr]C[If white K2 then how shoud black respond?

What should black do about whites upper left moyo?

Todd: If white plays K2, Black H3 saves most of the stones.  Sure, you'll lose L2 and lose the potential to capture white's L-shaped group.  In all honestly, though, white's L-shaped group should never have been captured - you got lucky in being able to capture it here.  So, while in this game you were able to get it, I wouldn't count on it.  I would consider L2 to be a lost stone if white goes K2.

As far as the moyo, the same opportunities (meager as they are) exist - a probe around C15, or curling around with H14 and pressing to the left, as shown in the variation, are probably the best options.  You could also try a stone around C9 or C10 and try to split D8 away, but that seems a tough prospect.]
;W[np];B[mp];W[nr];B[mr];W[oo];B[jr];W[po];B[qo];W[qn];B[rp]
;W[rn];B[pr];W[ps];B[qs];W[os];B[rr]C[Todd: White wasted many moves here to attack your black group on line N.

Your black group there has poor shape and is trapped between two white groups.  It should, in theory, never survive.]
;W[mo];B[nn];W[ms];B[lo];W[mn];B[lp];W[ln];B[ko];W[jo];B[kn]
;W[km];B[jn];W[nm];B[jm]C[Is this too slow?

Todd:  Well, it doesn't serve a lot of purpose, since white can easily capture O5 and O6 if pressured, and you've already got the white group around K5 wrapped up.  Any of the moves towards the moyo would be better.

During the game, were you wondering how to get into white's moyo?  You've asked at several points during this game about how to do it - realize that the longer you wait with moves like K7, the tougher it will get.  Moyos are best invaded early.  I know the prospect of invading that moyo is not promising, but remind yourself as a player that it is only going to get _less_ promising as the game goes on.]

(;W[on]C[Todd: This move was wasted by white.  There's no hurry.  See the variation.]
;B[io];W[qh]C[Todd: This move is a time bomb for black.  Big trouble -- notice that white waited to drop this bomb until he had a nice strong white group in the lower right to aid his attack.]
;B[og]C[Todd: I assume here that you're trying to seal white's R12 in.  Not a bad idea, but he has a lot of room to work with down there and your black group isn't very strong.]
;W[qf];B[rd]C[Todd: This move should have been a lot tighter.  R15 is supremely better - it attacks white's R14 immediately, and is connected to your 3 black stones.  Your S16 is retreating here for no real reason.  Don't give up area when you don't have to.]
;W[rj]
(;B[pg]C[Todd: This is a poor move by black.  White can, and does, ignore it.  Even if white didn't ignore it, white R13 simply strengthens white.  It's an easy exchange that greatly benefits white.

Overall, in this game, I'd say your attacks are far too light.  If you want to attack white, go to it!  Don't give him moves which are simple to defend (or ignore).  See the variation for some black attacks.]
;W[ql];B[if]C[Should black better pull G16 out, or use K16 for helping reducing or inading whites upper left, or is J15 a good move, attacking N16 group first and building strength.

Todd: Right idea with this move, but as shown before, curling around and putting H15-16 in atari is far better.  I wouldn't bother trying to save G16 given that it's all by itself and your J16 group isn't very strong.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[ob]C[Can N16 group be killed?

Todd:  Maybe it can be, but by a far better player than I am.  I seriously doubt it, but we'll see.]

(;B[lc]C[Todd: This is the right idea, but again I think it's a little too light - white has a simple response that:

1) Strengthens the white group, and

2) Attacks your black stone.

White N17 gives sente to white.];W[mc];B[dh]C[At last, is this too late and what about the next sequence. Black can capture H16 now, but maybe black could have done better in the coming sequence?

Todd:  This is an interesting move.  I like that you're able to pull G16 out with this, thanks to the ladder block.  If your goal is to attack the moyo, this is a poor move (but there aren't a lot of good ones).  If your goal is to pull out G16, this is excellent.]
;W[di];B[eh];W[ch]
(;B[ge]C[What the most efficient way to capture H16, maybe F16?

Todd: This is the best way.  Grip the two white stones tightly.  It might seem like a slow play, it might seem like F16 would allow you more room into the white moyo...  See the variation.  Remember that these two stones are _not_ captured.  A move like F16 is based on the assumption that they are, and when you're fighting on uneven territory as black is here, those assumptions are deadly.]
;W[gh];B[gg];W[qg];B[oe];W[mf];B[mh]C[Todd: I think this move is no good.  You've finally gotten some of what you wanted - a slight invasion into white's moyo.  And now you've abandoned it!  Things were going well in the upper left - continue pressing in.  Now a move like F16, or even E16 is better.  C13 is another option.  You've got lots of room to work out there.  Keep in mind that it might seem you're letting white proceed off N14, but do you really think white will ignore a further pressing into his moyo?  Certainly not, I would think, so take the initiative.

Do not be in such a rush to answer white.];W[kf];B[jf]C[Todd: Very slow, very weak.]
;W[kg];B[jh];W[kd];B[cm];W[cl];B[bm];W[bl];B[fm];W[kh];B[ji]
;W[kc]C[Todd: All these moves around the center area should be ignored by black.]
;B[ei];W[kl];B[jl];W[kk];B[ki];W[nj];B[oi];W[fk];B[ek];W[el]
;B[fl];W[hg];B[hf];W[ej];B[fj];W[dk];B[gk];W[am];B[an];W[fi]
C[Todd: A better move here is F12, attacking that white stone and preserving your group.  Remember, just because an opponent puts a stone in atari doesn't mean you have to save it.  Here, you can put one of his stones in atari to your advantage - saving the black group around D12 is worth a lot more than a couple stones down below.]

(;B[ed]C[Todd:  I think a stone at E17 works better - see the variations.  Again, in general, don't be afraid to use a stone as a sacrifice, purposefully putting it out of reach but knowing that you'll be able to lean on it later.  As always, I don't know how accurately I've read out these variations - they're just ideas.

Of course, the tough question is how to know when to throw in a stone and when to just play it safe.  Here, white's stones around G18 are a little weak, so play to attack them.  Remember, if you throw in a stone and you lose that stone without making any gains, you've probably lost 2-5 points.  If you make gains, as you can see in the upcoming variations, they can be quite large.]

[la][ka][ja][ia][ha][ga][fa][ea][da][ca][ba][aa]C[Todd:  Final Comments:  Overall, black played a good game.  The biggest mistakes I saw were not invading white early enough, even though you seemed to know you should have been.  Also, when you did attack white (not necessarily his moyo, but in other places on the board), your attack was too light, not aggressive enough.  You allowed white to make easy responses and strengthen his stones while never really threatening them.  This strategy is more in line with reducing moves, where the intent is not to attack and destroy, but in most cases in this game, you should have been attacking.  You settled too easily for reduction.

Like I said, though, overall you played solidly - I didn't see many glaring, absolute errors.  Your play seemed pretty consistent throughout.

I hope these comments helped - this is the first game I've reviewed for GTL (I've reviewed other games on my own before).  Feel free to contact me with any questions.]
