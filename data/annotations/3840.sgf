C[My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and I'll be reviewing your game.

I think your biggest problem in dealing with the invasion in the lower left is your thought that all of the territory should have been yours.  White could easily have invaded at C3 and made a living group.  However, you were comfortably ahead even if White invaded at C3.  White played very passively and allowed you to get a big moyo.

Having said that, White made any number of mistakes after the invasion at move 160 that would have made it easier for you to kill the group.  I've pointed out several of them.

I've also pointed out some mistakes that both of you made earlier in the game.]

(;W[fq]C[Ted: I'm fairly confident that White should have been able to survive by invading at C3 instead of F3.

More importantly, however, you don't have enough stones in the bottom left to ensure that all the territory is yours.  If you're good at estimating the score (which I'll admit is not always an easy thing to do -- I have difficulty with it, and when I got a review from a player around ~5k, he told me *he* had difficulty estimating the score at times!), you should be able to figure out what you need to do.

White's score is easy to count: If you count all the points, White has 74 points, plus four more prisoners, plus komi.   If you assume Black can kill any white invasion here, Black gets ~160 points.  So, Black *should* be able to win despite letting one White invasion succeed.  (Note that in the C3 variation, Black wins comfortably).  So, I'd play F4 here with a view to restricting White to the bottom of the board.]

(;B[eq]C[Ted: Although I'd play F4, your move isn't that bad.]
;W[fp];B[hp]C[Ted: I think you should play D6 here, with a view to restricting White to a small group at the bottom center.]
;W[er]C[Ted: White should have played either D5 or C3 here.]
;B[dr];W[ep];B[dq];W[fs];B[ds]C[Ted: This move isn't necessary.  I would take away White's eye space by playing at G2, which forces White to respond with F2.]

(;W[es];B[gr];W[fr];B[gq];W[do];B[co];W[dn];B[cn]C[Ted: I think I would play F6 -- the "eye-stealing tesuji" here instead.  White has to respond to prevent you from playing E5, after which you can put C6 in if necessary.]
