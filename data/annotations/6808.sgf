C[Improvements for your game:

You play slow moves.  You should take sente to capture big points, like controlling the corners or defending your groups.

You tend to make your opponent stronger but not actually fix your own weaknesses.  Play simple moves that do what you need them to do effectively.

C[This move doesn't exist and is a mistake.  It is a mistake because it is too slow.]
;W[dn];B[dr];W[cq];B[lq];W[hq]C[This move seems fine.  It punishes g4 because g4 is really really slow.]
;B[gn];W[in];B[gl]C[I like white.  Black has many stones that don't do anything and f3/d2 don't yet make more than two points.]

(;W[lo]C[This move is slack.];B[np];W[od]C[You can't treat the bottom group lightly, you've invested 4 stones there next to his weak group.  You can't give that up so easily.]

(;W[kb]C[Very slow.  You're not worried about your top group.]

;W[hf];B[ig];W[hg];B[jh];W[hh];B[ji]C[[A\]Black connects, and White is left with thin groups. They are not necessarily under immediate danger, but Black can reduce them a lot.
Regarding territory: I counted around 60 points for Black, and around the same for White including komi. The advantage that Black has is that he is thicker (White has open skirt at the top and on the left etc). Do you agree?]
