AB[pp][dp][pd]C[I played white.

I played this game by E-mail.  So, the game actually took a few
months to complete with a few moves exchanged a day.

I have made some comments and questions in the game record.  Also, any general suggestions for areas of study would be appreciated.]
;W[dd]C[In this situation,should attack the white stone.
However, playing q10 or K4 is also a good move];B[pj];W[nc]
;B[ob]MA[pj]C[This move is a bad move for two reasons :
The stone does not really protect the corner.
The stone does not really attack the white stone.

Therefore white can attack the corner by the other side R14 or R14, but the blue marked stone was here to protect this side... This is not coherent with the previous move.

So this move is not good by itself, but also by reference to the previous move...]
;W[oc]C[I think white should have left the corner by now, by doing this, it will only make black stronger in the corner making an attack by the other side harder.]
;B[pc];W[nb];B[pb];W[oe];B[od]C[This move is really not good, it is a dame !! there is no points here !!]
;W[nd];B[pe];W[of];B[pg]C[Is this an acceptable result for white?

I think this is not a good result for white, because in this situation black has secured somehow 25 points when white has only made a little wall without extension.
If black play somewhere near G17, the wall will have no global influence.
So, in this situation, white should play somewhere near G17 to stabilize its wall. However, this will leave balck initiative which is not good for white.

So, not a good result for white];W[cn]
(;B[co]MA[ob]C[This move is far better than the blue marked move in the upper left corner.
The good point is that it really attacks the white stone.  However, if the joseki is played like shown in the variation, white can extend up to D10. And when the joseki is ended, the corner is always opened (white play san-san).

This move must be used only where there is a black stone near D10. In that case this is a very good move.]
;W[cq]C[I didn't want to repeat the sequence in the upper right corner.

This should have not hapened (see the previous move variation).   The current move can be done but only after the correct joseki, white D6, black F4 and white D10.

Here, you seems to say, ok I'd want to take the left side with my C6 stone, but now I'd prefer the corner or the right side. If this was the case, you should have played F3 or san-san without playing C6...]
;B[dq]C[correct answer]
(;W[cp]C[Bad answer, see the variation for the good answer]
;B[bo]C[black takes the corner with this corner.

So white first want the left side by plaing C6, then says that he prefers the corner by plaing san-san. Then with the last two moves says that finally he wants the corner.

However, now the result is bad for white, since black has taken the corner (20 points) and white has lost two stones and the C6 stone is too close to black stones...]
;W[bn];B[cr];W[dn];B[do];W[dj]C[I decided to give up the invading stones in the corner and make
a base for my wall of three stones instead

The two stones are lost since blakc plays B5...
This time you decide to make an extension to your wall (that was not the case in the upper-left corner). However this extension is too close from your wall.  The optimal extension for wall should be placed with an empty space of n+1, n being the size of the wall. Your extension should have been pur at D11 ...]
;B[fc]C[This is a very good move.
I think this is the best move black can do in this situation.

As I said before, this move attacks the upper left corner but also makes the white wall in the right upper corner inneficient.]
;W[id]C[I wanted to play off my upper right wall.

This is a good idea, becaus this makes an extension to your wall and attacks the black stones.

However, since your wall is about 5 stones it, this tone wil have be better put at H17 : better extension from the wall and better attack]
;B[dc];W[cc];B[ed];W[db];B[ec];W[de];B[gd]C[Another stone that means nothing ...
no connection, no real extension, no life basis,

==> bad move

A good sequence should have be E18 then H18 to stabilize...]
;W[nq]C[good, black lost a move when playing G16, white take profit of this by attacking the last opened corner...]
;B[oq]C[As befor, good move by itself, but globally, thisi is not good since white cannot be in danger after the correct joseki.]
;W[nr]C[Whoo,

what's the sense of this move.It does not attack the corner and don't take any points...

bad move !!!];B[or];W[no];B[eb];W[qm];B[pn];W[ro];B[rp];W[qj]
;B[qi];W[qk];B[pi];W[pk];B[ok];W[qo];B[qp];W[po];B[jp];W[jq]
;B[iq];W[kq];B[ip]C[Ok, let's see what is the situation.   In the begining, black has 3 handicaped stones.  It has now three corners, two half side, plus some ill stones
White has a corner, near 3/4 of one side (but always opened, black can invade at C13 or C12) and some little points in the right lower corner, plus an opened wall.

So this is not a so good situation for white.
If black can live in the upper left corner, and invade the left side, white will have near no points...

So the next step for white is to kill the black stones. If not, black wins]
;W[ol]C[bad move,  black must answer to keep a good path to the center, but this is really not an important point...]
;B[nk];W[nl];B[ff]C[Ouch, it seems that black wants to live ...]
;W[dg];B[el]C[very bad moves, if white answer he will close its previous opened territory. This move is like saying white : "hello, do you know that you're territory is opened here ? Please close it, thanks" !!!]
;W[dl];B[en]C[A better move may stabilize the black group in the upper left corner...]
;W[hb]C[good, move,

attacks the black group and makes territory in  the upper side.

Now the black and white posistions are closer. However if black stabilizes itself, he will win... He has always one corner more than white (about 20 points)]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[gb];W[ke];B[ib];W[jb];B[ha]C[Black group lives, he will win]
;W[ja]C[Was this necessary?  Looking at it again now it looks like I
should play elsewhere.

Right, this is an end game move.  You can no more win points from black, you should resign here...]
;B[dm];W[cm];B[em];W[cl];B[ek];W[ho]TR[jo][jn][im][hl][gk][fk]
C[I wanted to reduce the large potential area marked by the triangles.
I expected black to block below me and allow me to run out.

This is too late, even if blacks lets you run this stone in the center, he wins]

C[This was an error on my part.  I had failed to add stones 184
and 185 to my game record, so I thougth that those spaces were
open.];B[fj];W[ls];B[ks];W[ms];B[jr];W[il];B[mr];W[nn];B[ko]

You MUST read all sequences that can happen if you want to kill, it is clear here that black has two eyes ...]

This result was predictible since the middle of the game. You should have resigned at this time]
