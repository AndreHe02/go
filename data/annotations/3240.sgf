C[Hi !
Thank you for your review. Please review for black. There is a question about strategy at move 87, but feel free to comment on any move that seems slow or inappropriate.

Hello, hope my comments are of some help];B[pe];W[dc];B[dp]
;W[ce];B[pp];W[jq];B[jc];W[pc];B[nd]C[I think you could have better choosen for O17 or N17 because here your stone at K17 could end up a bit ineffective]
;W[qe]
(;B[qf];W[qd];B[pf];W[nb]C[feels like K17 has lost a bit of its power]
;B[qk];W[nq];B[pn];W[fq];B[cn];W[cj]
(;B[pq]C[hmm this move feels a bit slow, if you wanted to play a secure profit orientated move I think D2 would be better. Since that group is cleary your weakness right now and also aims at H3]
;W[dr]
(;B[hq];W[fo];B[ho];W[cq]C[Black is already in a lot of trouble since you've got 2 weak groups, B should look for a way to settle at least one of them fast or run to safety, M3 looks like overplay, I think K5 would have been better to make shape for your 2 stones and keep an attack on white's two stones, But D4 and C6 should be your primairy concern right now. Running away with E7 looks possible]

(;B[ir];W[kq]C[now you've got 3 weak groups :(];B[lr];W[ls]
;B[ms];W[ks];B[nr];W[hm];B[fn]C[I think B got lucky here, G5 looks more solid for white]

;B[do];W[lc];B[mc];W[ld];B[mb];W[lb];B[na];W[ob]C[B is leading now and should not want to make the game complicated, but here B started a fight that could easily decided the outcome of the game

Just reducing white's territories should be more than enough]
;B[id];W[ge];B[jf];W[lf];B[jh];W[lh];B[nh]C[O12 is wrong, B should do something about his 4 stones first before anything else]
;W[lj]C[settling this group is difficult, I would try the following:]

(;B[nj]C[Here I wanted to make territory on the right side, while having the K17 black group live by itself. Is it the right strategic approach ? If yes, how to make life with the K17 black group ? If no, what is the best strategy ?

No, this was very wrong, you were leading with much, and now your making the outcome depend on the life of the 4 b stones. B shouldn't have made that weak group in the first place]

;B[ic];W[ga];B[kb];W[la];B[hf]C[b is giving white profit in the UL corner and isn't alive yet, ( even if B plays K19 white can still make a ko with W L19, B L17 W J19, but B's group should be able to live now
