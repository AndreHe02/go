C[Hello,

I am davidY and i would like you to please review this game. It was a difficult fight for me, and I felt like there were so many ways we could have both attacked each other's weaknesses. Can you please spot how to attack my moves, and suggest alternative big moves for me? I know my opening theory is totally silly ^_^, but it gets more interesting later on. Can you help with the opening? I am very lost about that topic.

If the ranks look suspicious, me a 10k vs a 17k, it is because neither of us play other people ranked much. s0n9 now plays more and is about 13k, while I doubt I am at 10k, but more 13k ish

Thanks a lot,

David

I have preceded my comments with > so you can find them easily. I have also inserted many
variations, sometimes without a comment to show what "might have been." 

A couple of general comments: 

I think your biggest problems is that after the first few moves (20 or so) you have not tried to
make territory but tried to push black against the sides. This is not very effective because
each of his moves will make a few more points, while your's won't necessarily. So the advice
here is that you should try to make territory primarily (corners - sides - center) and only attack
as a secondary goal.

In the middle game you have both made many unnecessary moves which are basically missed
opportunities, as they could have been made useful elsewhere. Before you react to a move
make sure it is really needed, how much, if any you would use if you don't answer it. If you
have this, compare it to other possible moves on the board.

I hope my comments help, please let me know if you have any questions. You can reach me
at the address where the review is sent from.

Best,

F3 or J3 -- while your stone has no base again. I would have preferred H3 in this situation so if black approaches
from one side you have a little room on the other.];B[iq];W[dn]
