C[Thanks for reviewing my game.

My main problem was that I did not suceed in giving life to a group in the upper left corner while at the same time did not manage to kill a group on the right side. So I had to give up (I think).

Perhaps you could focus at that. But any further comments are welcome.

Many thanks once again!];B[qd];W[pp];B[dc];W[cp];B[ce];W[od]

(;B[qn]LB[nd:A]C[Black should play at A now. See variation.]

A pincer would work well with the marked stones.];B[pn];W[np]

;B[jc];W[gc]LB[nd:A]C[Bad invasion? Where else should I have invaded and how to make life to my stone at G17?

I think this is not the right time for an invasion. A would be a good move for white to prevent black from getting too much potential on the upper side. White has very little support for his invasion stone now.]

(;W[cj]LB[gg:A]C[I think white should have played A here and run with his stones to safety. Then black would have lost some territory on the upper side, but he gets compensation on the left side.]
;B[jo]LB[gg:A]C[Perhaps I now should have paid attention to my stones at G17/15 but how the best?

That would have been a good idea. I think the best you could do is keep running and play at A.]
;W[oi];B[ne];W[nf];B[hg]C[Now i began to struggle for life and finally was killed. Coujld I have prevented this?

It's a difficult situation. You may be able to live, but while you do black will get stronger and gain territory. If you had ran before another black attack, the situation would be less difficult. The move you chose seems good to me.]
;W[fg];B[gf];W[ff];B[fe];W[gg]C[It would be better not to play this move now.
It's not likely that black will play there himself, so the possibility will remain and later in the game it could be better to give atari from the other side.]

I don't know if it's possible or not. If you try to kill a group it's important to stay strong yourself. If you have many weaknesses in your position the opponent can usually live by exploiting them.]

The situation now is indeed hopeless for white.
The main reason is the invasion in the upper left which gave black a nice target to attack. White missed a few opportunities to defend and with the death of the white group, black has a comfortable lead.]
