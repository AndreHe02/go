C[This was a very unusual game for both me and my opponent. I ended up losing a game by 2.5 pts with komi of 6.5.   What makes it unusual is the fact that we did not play by the book, but rather played looking at the whole board sticking to our own thoughts rather than known josekis. I put my own comments into the SGF file along with some question. I would like a reviewer to analyze not only the moves i made but also comment on the rationale for those moves. Thank you in advance!!

;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[qk];W[ci]C[Since i am W and i do not know a strong way to respond to chinese opening, i mirrowed it up to this point

I recently read Kato`s book on the Chinese.  He gives a couple of examples where both sides play the Chinese.   This can frequently turn into a muyo battle.]
;B[fq]
(;W[ip]C[Although this move is ok, i was not sure how to fully take advantage of it. + correct me if i am wrong, but Q3 makes it hard for W here

I think k4 is a bit better in this situation.  If black dives into the corner you get thickness on the bottom.  If black counter pincers it wont be so annoying.]
;B[kp]LB[in:B][eq:C][jq:A]C[Not sure how to respond to this move. Possible responces i can think of here are marked. Please tell me if there are better moves and if my choices are wrong, tell me why for each?]

(;W[jq]TR[ip][lr]C[I chose A and this left marked stones in a relatively weak position. The reason i went for A is because i wanted to attack F3 later or ... jump to center. This move was defending in nature, but it seems too small and ineffective

Ix:  This move is not bad.  You should aim for m2 next making the L4 stone look silly and useless.  It also settles your group]
;B[dn]LB[cl:C][cn:A][eo:B]C[dAgain - not sure what best responce is. Since i thought it would lead to comlicated fight, i chose defensive strategy at A.

Other choices i thought of are shown.

After this position, i kept worrying about marked stones and their position relative to the rest of board.  B seems to be much better developped up to this point and that troubled me.

Ix: One of the ways to deal with this is the attach  joseki and extend joseki (see var).  Of your variations A and C seem to mild and are allowing black to dictate the game.  B is a nice move splitting blacks stones.]

(;W[cn]C[Ix:  This is a bit more annoying for black ....he cant do many of the normal moves because of c11.]

(;B[fo]LB[cm:A]C[I expected "A" as a responce here

Ix: D 6 was a overplay.  It is evident since it required such a move to get black`s stones into a group.]
;W[dq]C[Not sure what to exect next i solidified the corner]

(;B[fm]C[I think this was not a good move by B, since other, bigger moves are available.

Ix:  One of the reviewers for gtl a while back made the point that the critical move comes before the "big" move.  I cant agree more.  It is almost always better to make a solidifying move rather then a big move which could allows opponent a series of forcing moves.

This move pretty much means black no longer has to worry about this group and can fight with a free hand elsewhere on the board.]

(;W[in];B[kn];W[fp]TR[qk][kn][kp][pq]C[Although i was able to cut, marked stones created an alarming formation. Please suggest, strategically how can i avoid this in future

Ix:  The reason you have the problem with the formation is because you made the j6 for L6 trade.  See my remarks on m2 a few moves back.

As for the cut-- normally this doesnt work unless you have solid as steel groups on both sides of the planned cut.  This one works but it really doesnt gain a lot of points and harms the k3 group.]
;B[gp];W[ep]
(;B[ho]LB[go:A][io:B]C[I expected "A" here for B, but H5 is better because it threatens cut at "B"]
;W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[hr]C[Ix:  A mistake obviously.  H4 was necessary.]

[bn:4][co:1][do:2]TR[kn][kp][pq]C[I went L3 here, but i am not sure if it was really needed. What would be a good replacement choice instead of L3?

My choices are shown.

Kindly notice that the reason i chose to proceed pushing with L3 is becase i wanted to undermine B's marked stones a little bit. Please tell me if this thinking is correct?

Ix:  Before we go into your choices lets do a bit of counting.  I have white at about 75 and black around 60 which includes komi.  So up to this point white has done well!  As for the choices:

A is a very nice move.  I think k16 maybe a tad better since black has thickness towards the center which it can help offset.  Also you dont want your stones "flat".

B is not such a good move since black can do the sequence 1-5.  Better locally is just c7.

C is a standard invasion so it is okay.];B[jp];W[iq];B[lp]
(;W[lq]C[Again, i chose to push some more

I like the idea but n2 is faster!];B[de];W[gd]LB[ce:A]TR[ci]
[cn]C[I chose G16 over A, as i felt that in this position, there is more on the side than corner that i can take advantage of. Moreover marked stones are overextended that would further complicate fight for the corner and areas around it.

F16 is more common but there certainly is no fault in the move chosen.]
;B[dh];W[di]LB[cm:A]C[Please comment on this move as i have mixed feelings about it :)

This move is perfectly fine.  Next white should look to play at A grabbing the left side.]

(;B[fg]C[I think F13 is bad for B, please comment

Its pretty much "run away".   Attaching by black at c17 seems better.]

(;W[ef]LB[cc:B][jd:C][cm:A]C[Tactically i think this move is good, but strategically it lacks weight. Please comment

This move is pure impatiance.  You should ALWAYS look toward how to make territory while attacking.  A-C all look nice.  C16 would look good but if I recall correctly there is a flaw with the c16, d17, and g16 structure that black can exploit.]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[eh]C[E12 was strong for B, i think, as i myself wanted to go there]
;W[hf]LB[nc:A][md:B][me:C][hh:D]TR[ef]SQ[fd][gd]C[With this move i wanted to accomplish the following:

1. possibly connect to marked stone and cut

2. make my next move at A,B,C (approve one, or suggest better move) and build on a side

3. jump to center with D (i like this the least)

Ix:  This move was very bad.  The big problem is it isnt a forcing move (black ignored it).  He is very stong in the center so there is little danger of getting trapped.  Also until you get in c7 white`s stones at c11 are very weak and can be cut off.  

Good moves here are k16, c16 , o17, r14, etc.  C7 will alway be a good move so I will cease mentioning it ^_^.]
;B[ei]C[E11 is the reason i had mixed feelings about D11]
(;W[cl]C[Ix:  Good!  E10 would have been bad in this situation.]
;B[kc]C[Ix:  Very big move!]
(;W[po]LB[qf:B][qo:A]TR[lq]C[This was a mistake on my part i think. The reason i went there was in attempt to link up the marked stones.

I think "A" is better here. Please comment

Also generally speaking would you pick A over B orB over A. Why?

A is horrible because of the r9 stone.  As a general rule r5 is bad in the chinese setup.  It is far worse  here because black is so strong in the area.

Q5 is the deepest you should dare go.

B is okay.  Standard invasion.  I like q10 here reducing black.]

(;B[qo]C[Ix:  This helps white.];W[pp];B[qp];W[oq];B[pr];W[mp]
;B[or];W[nq];B[pn];W[md]LB[ic:A]TR[kc][pd]C[N16 - an attempt to cut marked stones. I did not want to play sumbissively at "A". Was my choice correct?

Ix:  It is okay.  There were a couple other alternatives such as r 14 as well.]
;B[nc];W[mc]C[A fight has begun, plese comment on my moves during the fight

Ix:  Seperating is a good start!];B[hc]
(;W[gb]C[Ix:  This move seems bad to me.  It allows the forcing moves later of g17 and h18.  Since your goal is to deny eyespace g17 by black seems best even tho it does make a empty triangle.]
;B[gc];W[fc];B[hb];W[jd]C[.];B[fb]
(;W[jb]C[Ix:  This move is wrong.  With the ponnuki black is surely alive.  Better is for white to fix his shape with e18, L17, etc.]
;B[jc];W[kb];B[lc];W[lb];B[id]TR[jd]C[Ix:  The triangle stone is a leftover from a fight and should be abandoned.  Trying to save it is what gets white in so much trouble.]

(;W[db]TR[jb][kb][lb][dc][mc][md]SQ[fc][fd][gd]CR[jd][je][hf]

;B[ec];W[ed];B[dd];W[bc];B[ie];W[if]LB[jf:A]C[Ix:  White really gets fortunate here.  If black cuts at A the position would be near collapse.]

(;B[ge];W[ib];B[ic];W[gf]C[Ix:  Not good.  Your trying to save a stone but the group saving it is in a perilous situation.  Better to abandon it.]

(;B[fe];W[cd]C[Ix:  good];B[ce];W[be];B[cb];W[bb]C[Ix:  Excellent response!]
;B[da];W[cc];B[ff];W[ca]
(;B[hd]C[Ix:  Not necessary.  Better is tennuki or attack.]
;W[kf]C[Ix:  I think the solid connection is better in this situation since it gives black a extra move in building a wall.]

[qk]C[At this point i would love to play in between of marked stones, perhaps at "A" or "B" (which better?), but i felt that i have to reinforce center better as B is becoming increasingly strong

Ix:  I think you did the right choice--center first.   B seems best since you will probably be running away ^_^]

(;W[ii];B[ih];W[jh];B[jg];W[kh];B[ig];W[kl]C[This sequence allowed me to gain some strength in center although side still looks entirely Black

Yes.  You wipe out almost all blacks potential territory there for 9 points.]
;B[jf]TR[gf][hf][if]C[I gladly sacrifised 3 marked stones for center influence]

(;W[ld]C[Ix:  After a very good sequence in the center this move is very bad.  

1.  Makes bad shape (empty triangle).
2.  In no way improves the connection of white.  
3.  The threat at L16 still exists.
4.  Black can go L13 and then cut at m12 making white`s entire center floating.

Essentially it is a pass at this vital part of the game!];B[kg]

(;W[lh];B[lg];W[pj]C[Q10 started a sequence that allowed me to get some of B's side

Ix:  Shoulder hit is a good method to reduce.  You are a bit seperated however....]
;B[ni]C[Ix:  Black is trying to attack both groups at the same time.  Nice idea.  This is VERY perilous for white now.]

(;W[mj]C[Ix  This is suicide for the q 10 stone.  You must make moves that dont result in one group hurting another.]
;B[nj];W[mk]
(;B[nk];W[gl];B[jm]C[allowing K7 was a big mistake by W];W[jl]
C[Ix:  Black is better off doing p6:

1,  Makes the q10 stones life nearly impossible.
2.  Threatens 2 stones with p4.
3. Gives the L5 group a option of linking up that way.
4.  J7 is still a option.]
(;B[im];W[qm]C[side attack has bagun]
(;B[oo]C[Ix:  Big mistake.  Black needed to go q9 which takes the whole side!]

(;W[op]C[Ix:  This makes p5 forcing :-(.  Better here is q9 making life on the side.]
;B[qn];W[pk];B[ql];W[qj]C[Ix:  The fight on the right center can turn into a complicated life and death problem.]

Ix: Yes.  Playing the ko immediately is lets black slip into the corner.]

(;B[ck]C[Ix:  The simple b 7 was safer for black.  I can understand his desire to grab any points he can tho.  By my count the game is nearly even.  O2 for white or m1 for black could nearly decide the game.]

I think the things that you should look to improve on are:

1.  Be aware of the option of reducing rather then invading.
2.  When a opponent is seaking life try to not let him have so many forcing moves.  
3.  Take the time to make that move that solidifies your position before moving on to the next big move.
