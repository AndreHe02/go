C[(jantje): Dear reviewer, thank you for your time and effort! I put in some questions and comments that may show you where my thinking needs straightening out...
I was White, but pointers for my opponent are also most welcome since I'd like to share this review with him.

Hi!

This is a difficult game (for me), so I don't know if my comments are of any help - but let's hope the best ;)]
;B[cp];W[pp];B[dc];W[pd];B[nq];W[ep];B[qn];W[oo];B[qq];W[dn]
;B[eq];W[dp]LB[dq:C][fq:A][pq:B]C[(jantje): I did not want to play A (F3) because W then will get thickness directed along the bottom, but in gote. B may then play B (Q3) to neutralize.

---------------

A good decision, I think. WC instead should also have been possible.]
;B[dq];W[co];B[bp];W[cq]LB[bn:B][fp:A]C[This looks strange to me. Better to play  WA. If Black answers (B), White has sente and there is still some aji in the corner.]
;B[cr];W[bo];B[bq]LB[fp:A]TR[dn]C[The natural and best move, but A is worth a thought. If White captures, the marked stone is wasted.]
;W[de]LB[fp:A]C[(jantje): Or is A (F4) necessary?

------------------

I don't know about "necessary", but A looks normal to me. 

But I think Blacks shape in the lower left is too good, so playing elsewhere may be best.]
;B[cg]C[Black is trying to hard here, no?];W[be];B[fd];W[ef]
;B[cj]LB[di:A]C[A looks more promising!?];W[ej];B[cd];W[ce]
;B[ei];W[fi];B[fh];W[di];B[eh]LB[dh:A]C[Playing at A instead looks interesting!?]
;W[dh];B[fj];W[dj];B[gi];W[ck]C[(jantje): I very much doubt Black's choice here, the side seems too big.

--------------------

Much too big ;)];B[pq]LB[hc:B][fp:A]C[(jantje): I often get in trouble with the formation in the lower right, please help! Apart from the lower right, A and B (F4 and H17) are crying out for attention: please give your advice on who should have played there, and when. Also I really have no idea which is the bigger of the two.

----------------

I don't have an idea, either :) But, generally, playing near the less setteld positon is best, so in a fast game, I would play around B.

I'am not sure if Black is right in emphasizing the lower side. At the moment, all his stones there are low, so it will be hard to develop a promising moyo.]
;W[mo]LB[qj:A][ro:B]C[This and the next white move create a strange shape... How about WA instead? That's big, and if Black stops White from playing at B next, White can decide then how to play with his two stones. Maybe it's best not to create a weak group here...]
;B[lp];W[pm];B[pk]C[Again, Black tries to hard in my eyes.]
;W[qm];B[ro];W[qi]LB[qj:B][nl:C][rm:A]C[WA instead looks nice; White can continue then with WB or WC.]
;B[rk];W[nl]LB[rm:A]TR[qi]C[Inconsistent, I think. The marked stone was an attacking move, so White has to continue by separeting the black groups wiht WA]
;B[oj];W[pg];B[mk];W[nk];B[nj];W[mj];B[lk];W[mi];B[rm]TR[mi]
[mj][lk][mk]C[Black is happy. Now the marked white stones have no purpose, but the marked black ones work well, separating a weak white group.]
;W[lm];B[jk];W[kl];B[kk];W[im];B[kn];W[km];B[jn];W[il];B[fp]
LB[hc:A][gf:C][hj:B][hp:D]C[(jantje): First big point goes to B, now I  must have A (H17) to keep the balance.

Hm... To me, the lower side doesn't look that big. If White plays at B, he has ideas like WC later, or attaking the four stones in the center. Also, ih the white group in the middle is safe, White can play at D, I think.]
;W[in];B[ip];W[hp]C[I feel a little bit uneasy about playing this area out at once.]
;B[hq];W[gq];B[gp];W[ho];B[iq];W[hc]LB[pc:C][gf:B][hj:A]C[I am not sure about the play here. The marked stone hits a weak point in the black position, but in the process Black gets strong at the outside, and White loses potential in the center (let's say WA, looking for WB). So maybe simply enclosing the corner with WC is also interesting?!]
;B[hd];W[id];B[he];W[jc]LB[hb:H][ib:F][ec:A][ic:D][jc:E][nc:B]
[pc:C][jd:G][jg:I]TR[mi][mj][jk][kk][lk][mk]C[(jantje): I played this to make miai of A and (somewhere around) B.

--------------

"Somewhre around B" doesn't secure the corner properly, I think :) I also think WA isn't that big. The corner is open already, so all White can do here ist to play a very big endgame move instead of a big one. It would be different if White could create a weak black group, but I can't see that... Another idea could be WC, BD, WF, WG, BH, WI - in my eyes, the marked white and black cutting stones in the center should be used in some way?! Hm. Difficult :)]
;B[pc];W[oc];B[qd];W[od];B[ob];W[nb];B[qb];W[ec]LB[qe:A]C[(jantje): W can first play A in sente, right?

At some point, White should play there, yes ;)];B[ed];W[dd]
;B[eb];W[cc];B[fc];W[cb]LB[oa:C][pb:D][rd:B][qe:A][jg:E][hj:F]
C[This is small! White should exchange WB for BB, and WC for BD, then play in the center - maybe at E?! After that, White has some ideas like WF etc. The marked stone is a pure endgame move!]
;B[qe];W[oa];B[pb];W[of];B[ie];W[je];B[jf];W[kf];B[ke];W[jd]
;B[kg];W[lf]C[(jantje): This is as far as I can remember with certainty (it was a tournament game). Even though I won the game, I am far from certain that W is ahead at this stage: what do you think?
Thanks again!!

----------------------------------------


Black is not without hope here ;)

To sum the game up: I think both sides underestimated the center. Black plays a little to agressive in my eyes, and White's decision to make a big group out of the two stones in the lower rigt was dubious, perhaps.But as my commentaries show, I am not too sure about all this myself, so please check it  for yourself :) At least, this review should give you some new ideas to think about.]
