C[Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game.
At the beginning i was thick and strong but it seems that i didn't use my thic
kness efficiently.

PS : i'm french so please excuse my language mistakes :)

Reviewer: Hi, fantomas27, on  English me too.
Also effective use of the thickness is difficult for me. My motto is as follows: I  use thickness for attack, not for territory area especially in early stage.]
;B[pc]C[kamakura [1d\]: gg];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[qe];W[jc]C[isn't letting your opponent making two shimaris bad ?
R:In begining stage, no body can't say bad or good for each move besides 1st and 2nd lines. 
   In my memory, this formation was seen in professional player's game.]

(;B[md];W[le]LB[kc:1][jd:2][fe:3]C[i felt white escape too easily
R:i agree your intention, however,  four white stones  must live and each black stone (left and right corners) has enough territory. i cant say what is the best.]

(;B[mc]C[maybe too submissive ?
R: Like explanation  in the branch, difference of both moves(16-N and- M) are very narrow.]
;W[dc]C[i understand what white wants but isn't it a poor way to stabilise white
k17 stone ?
R:Your  first inspiration was right.];B[dd];W[ec]LB[ed:1][fd:2]
C[R: In this situation you must think  what is th best move.
   Separation (2) or connection (1) of the  two white lump stones  is the question. 
Separation was best and connection 2nd choice.]

;B[kd];W[cc]C[ii'm very happy with this result
R:This result (connection) is bad than separation (in branch), but the result was  not too bad.]
;B[pk];W[ni]C[i didn't see a way too attack this stone efficiently so i played elsewhere to see what will happen]
;B[qn]C[R: Though I don't know the best position, this 29 move is good.]
;W[np];B[lq]C[i thought i could have launch a double attack but maybe it was a bad idea ?
R:This move(31) was a bad idea as your mention,
    attack target was white stone (28),  not  one space enclosure (white 4 and 30) and moreover black stones were separeted in two parts.]
;W[iq];B[oq];W[op];B[nq];W[mp];B[kq]C[R:37 move was  good.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on]LB[pi:C][ko:D][qo:A][pq:B]C[R:Black A move is seemd good one, but 
4 black stones became week by exchange white B.
Therefore,  A or B move must postpone until new situation (if D point were black stone then move A; if C point were black then move B). This situation is called MIAI in Japanese.]

LB[kk:B][jm:C][po:A]C[it looks cool but is it a good idea ?
R:As white big stones is almost living ( by laying A position), now can't attack these stones.
However black big stones are not living, therefore b73 (13p)
should choose B or C .];W[qi];B[rj];W[lj]C[R:The exchange of  white two moves (76 and 78) and two black (77 and 79) were lucky for black. White did mistake.]
;B[kj];W[lk];B[jl]LB[qg:B][kl:D][jm:C][po:A]C[R:79 move was very good. 
  Black has only one week point, that is central black stones are not living.  The exchange of  white two move (76 and 78) and black (77 and 79) was white had no merit and black had big interest.
White should choose B (white is GOTE living by A point) instead of  76 , after the exchange of white C and  D.]
;W[ki]C[it hurts];B[jj];W[ll];B[lm];W[lh];B[cq]C[if white solidify this area the game would be over right ?
