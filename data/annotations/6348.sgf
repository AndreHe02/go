C[This is, I hope, an interesting game to analyze. Here I played as White. The game, due to mistakes by both sides, went close almost all the time, but the missed opportunity to kill Black lower right group made the day bad for me.
First of all, I would like to know whether the fuseki I played had bad mistakes. Second, how the LR black group could be killed (I am sure there is a tricky way to do this).

Thanks to the reviewer in advance.

F: Dear Inego,
I have 3 big remarks on this game

1) you gave away too easily the upper left corner.
2) letting black make a strong group on the lower left side (with move 11) was a big fuseki-mistake
3) the lower right black group couldn't be killed, but it should have given you an excellent opportunity to chase it and in the meantime build your own moyo (framework). Have a look at the variations. 
This is a general principle in go: attacking your opponent (if he lets you kill him even better) while making territory for your own. If he finaly lives with two points, and you made in between 30 points for your own, that's an excellent result.]

(;W[kq]C[F: This is not good,  to leave your stone at H3 alone. After catching this stone, the black group is strong. See variation]
;B[iq];W[ko]C[F: Black is strong now, so this move would be better at O4. Now an invasion at N3 looks promising for black.]

This is also bad shape. Locally P8 would be better]
