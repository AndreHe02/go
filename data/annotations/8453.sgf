C[*isao59518*: Hi!
Shinpachi: hf];B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[po];B[cp]C[Was tenuki ok? I didnt like w getting f4

reid: sure, tenuki is OK, but of course white gets a chance to get a move ahead in the lower right corner.  This is even: black is one move ahead in two corners, and so is white.]
;W[np];B[qo]C[would be better to play ladder breaker at c14 , then play o3?

reid: Perhaps, but white didn't play the inside hane (at R4), so it doesn't affect this game directly.

My own preference is to avoid fighting where I don't have an adventagous position.  Since black is behind in the lower right, I would probably leave that corner for later.  But R5 is reasonable too.]
;W[qn];B[qp];W[pn];B[qg]LB[nd:C][qf:B][pi:D][nr:A]C[reid: Stopping white's extension to around B (R14) is big, of course.  But so is the black corner slide at A (O2).  Without another move here, white can attack this corner very powerfully.  I think black should almost always play A unless there is a very strong reason not to.

We can imagine something like black A, white B, then black C (O16) and white D (Q11) (white Q10 feels a bit too close to the strong stones and too far from B).  This is a natural pacing, and feels like a reasonable exchange.

Black R13 feels a bit rushed to me.];W[nr];B[eq]LB[pl:C][gq:A]
[hq:B]C[reid: This feels like black is asking for a bit more than he deserves.  White can now get a ko from the lower right corner (which means black should consider it half-gone).  I think it would be better for black to leave the lower right corner alone in the first place (meaning, don't play R5) than to leave it now.

For example, if R5, R6, R4, and Q6 were all unplayed, black would have the option of playing somewhere around C, forcing white to respond with R5 perhaps.  Now white used three extra stones to take about 20 points - not efficient enough at this early stage of the game (each move should be worth about twice komi).

If black wants to play this way, I think it's better to go a bit further, to A (G3) or perhaps even to B (H3).]
;W[cj];B[fc]C[reid: The position has gotten a little difficult in that it's hard to find a good spot for black now.  By playing here, white will naturally defend so as to make his previous move (C10) good.

Now might be a good time black to defend the lower right corner in gote and see what white comes up with.  Black would then be ahead on territory, and it's not easy to see how white can make an immediate grab to get back to parity.  If white extends towards K17, his corner (C17) is still wide open to invasion.  If he defends the corner tightly, black can just keep grabbing territory to stay ahead of him.]
;W[df];B[ic]C[maybe c17 better?

reid: Most common is D18, of course.  Black plays J17 instead of D18 when he does not like the idea of white responding to D18 with a pincer (H17 or G17).  That does not seem to be a good idea for white in this game since black has a position in the upper right corner.

Black C17 is possible, but black will end up with a small corner while white builds outside influence.  This feels a bit like black doesn't want white to get anything.  But I would be nervous about all the outside thickness white could build.]
;W[rr];B[qr];W[rq];B[or];W[pp];B[qq];W[oq];B[rs];W[jd]C[reid: hmm, white chooses to not continue.  Perhaps he should have not started?]
;B[jc];W[kd];B[id];W[jf];B[ie];W[lg]LB[db:C][cc:D][ec:A][fd:B]
C[Im afraid of leave the ko at bottom right. whens the right time to protect from ko?

reid:Let's focus instead on the immediate situation.  Black really doesn't want white to play A (E17) as he has no good response to it.  Black B (F16) is almost forced, but it is too close to the three stone wall (J17).  Black has to exchange C (D18) for D (C17) now to prevent white A.]
;B[cl];W[ec];B[fd];W[fb];B[gb];W[ej];B[el]C[Too slow?

reid: I think so.  White E10 is not really urgent, especially if black ignores to takes E18 which is very huge.]
;W[eb]C[reid: Now white's corner is very large, and black has an awkward, cramped shape.]
;B[ip]C[should i m17?

reid: If black M17, white can still invade with R17, Q17, or Q18.

The game is now difficult for black.  White has some secure territory white black has only outlines of territory,  White has no groups that can come under attack, white black has the lower right ko to worry about.]
;W[kc];B[oc]C[b getting weaker . did i do something wrong?

reid: Yes, that black group looks a bit fragile now.  White probably can't kill it, but he can profit from attacking it.  He has already gained a large corner, and he is going to get more.  This kind of weakness almost always turns into territory for the other side.

Missing the D18/C17 exchange is a problem.  And I think it holds an important clue for black.  In some of my earlier comments, I mentioned that the moves feel rushed and that black expects too much.  Here I think black might have missed D17 because he didn't want white to get C17, getting a good hold on the left side.  And I think there is a deeper thread that is tying all these issues together: appreciation of the deep balance that underlies the game.

It is important to recognize that your opponent is going to be sharing the board space with you.  Keeping everything is just not in the nature of this game.  The more you try to keep it all, the more your opponent can use it against you.  Instead, you must let him have his share when he deserves it.  

More subtly, you must share sente, giving him sente when he deserves it.  The more you try to hold on to sente when you should be defending, the more trouble you will have later on.  In contrast, if you give up sente to form solid and stable shapes, then sente returns to you sooner because your opponent runs out of things to attack.

There are many moves left in this game, but rather than study the tactics that come later, I think you will progress faster if you work on the strategic aspects that brought the game to this point.  The early game is the most difficult, but also the most rewarding to study.  Subtle changes in your point of view can bring about significant changes to your games.

My suggestions for changes are: work on completing your shapes so your opponent can't easily attack you as the game develops; don't be afraid to let your opponent have his territory, just make sure that you're getting (or will get) a bit more; don't hold on to sente at the expense of your shapes.  

In a nutshell, don't rush the game, let it develop at its own speed.

Good luck, play strong,
