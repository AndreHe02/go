C[Game is between me, dangerbird, white, and oyaji, both 11k's on kgs now. Komi is 0.5 because i was 10k? at the time.

There are several obvious blunders. I have noted some of them in comments.

Thank you for taking the time for review!

Any tactical or strategical mistakes pointed out is good! If there are any moves that seemed good, it would be fun to hear it too!]

;W[dq];B[jc]LB[co:A]C[this is odd looking, and certainly unconventional.
The most common move is A, and almost universally
one would approach one of the white stones.];W[jp];B[qj];W[cn]
;B[dj];W[nq];B[jq]LB[fq:A]C[this isn't the right place to attack.... it will
just lead to a nasty fight.  Try "A"];W[ip];B[iq]C[running along the third line is rarely a good plan.]
;W[hq];B[hr];W[gq];B[gr];W[kq];B[fq];W[fp];B[gp]C[certainly not right tactically.  Black will end up
with way too many cutting points and surrounded
white.];W[hp];B[ep];W[go];B[eq];W[er]LB[dp:A]C[E2 seems to lead to problems ...

Try "A" instead];B[fr];W[dr];B[dp];W[cp];B[co];W[bo];B[cq];W[do]
;B[cr];W[bq]LB[eo:A]C[At this point "A" is better];B[br];W[ar]
;B[es];W[jr]LB[eo:A]C[K2 pointless?

Worse than pointless.  If you follow up at L2
you have given away sente for a very small
gain.  If you don't follow up (is is the case)
you've created an extra weakness for no gain.

Locally, both players should be looking
at the defect at A, but globally, the rest of
the board is way more important at this point.];B[ir];W[cf]
LB[df:A]C[getting on with the real game is a good idea,
but I don't think this is the best place. Playing
on the third line, You'll be hard pressed to keep
the black stones separated and/or to escape.

"A" would be my preference.];B[cd];W[ef];B[ch];W[fh]LB[fc:B]
[cl:A]C[
White is really forcing black to take
a desirable shape by playing at "A",
leaving B as another inviting point.];B[cl];W[fd]C[White doesn't have a good approach
move for the corner, because he has to
protect his eyeless group on the side.];B[fc]C[good choice]

(;W[gd]LB[ek:A]C[white: "please build a strong wall with lots of
territory behind it. 
==
Try "A" instead,  connect your  stones, make them
work together.  Use your big wall.];B[gc]C[black: ok, thanks!]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[ic];W[he];B[hb];W[ec];B[ed];W[fb];B[gb]
C[E17, F18 maybe pointless again ...

Pointless or worse.];W[nc];B[lc]LB[oo:A]SQ[il][jl][kl][ll][ml]
[nl][im][jm][km][lm][mm][nm][in][jn][kn][ln][mn][nn]C[Playing at A forces black into the corner, 
and threatens to form a territorial space.];W[qn]LB[qn:C][kp:A]
[kr:B]C[
Playing at C creates another weak group.
Not the best approach - the weaknesses
at "A" and "B" are likely to come into play
when the new weak group at "C" is attacked.];B[qo]LB[qj:B][pn:A]
C[Better to press down with "A" and keep white
weak and separated. The supporting stone at
"B" is important to this strategy.];W[pn];B[oq]C[
this is a bad shape for black - all cutting points.
White can even take the corner by playng the
3-3 point.];W[np];B[or];W[qg];B[oj];W[mj];B[qc];W[qd];B[pb]
;W[pc];B[rc];W[ob];B[rd];W[re];B[qa];W[rb];B[sb]C[
White has basicly no territory, but some
influence toward the center.  Black's only
problem is the right side - but with so much
running room it's very unlikely to be all white
in the end.]
(;W[nh]C[O8 seems better now if i aim to attack and make territory.

O8 is better.  The black group on the
side will have to scramble, and the going
is harder in that direction.];B[nk];W[mk];B[nm];W[ml];B[nl]
;W[oo];B[mm];W[lm];B[mn];W[ln];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl]C[good move.]
;W[ro];B[po]C[terrible choice.  this almost provided the miracle
white needs.];W[rp];B[nr];W[mr];B[qq];W[rq];B[rr];W[pr];B[op]

(;W[no]C[It now seems R2 would have killed black corner. I thought black would break through o5, n3 or something.

Yes, R2 looks good for white, but I think black can survive.  It gets quite complicated with lots of
opportunity to misread, though.];B[qr];W[ps];B[sr];W[qs]C[if you can't kill black (which surely you see
at this point) then you shouldn't play forcing 
moves like this either.  If black has to answer
to stay alive, they could be used later as Ko threats.
If black could ignore it (as is the case here) it's
a completely wasted move.]
(;B[rs]C[not necessary, see variation.];W[on];B[ql];W[fj]C[
At this point white is way behind, and his
only hope is to form a gigantic center territory.
Not a high probability - there are too many 
open doors.

So short of a miracle of a blunder, the
game is over, and we should reflect on
how we got to this point.

The rest of the game is just tricky fighting];B[kf];W[jh];B[fl]

I think both players are ranked about right; the
main flaw I see is the universal tendancy (in
weaker players) to get caught up in pointless
fights, losing sight of the big picture, and then
the outcome of the game is determined by
essentiually random outcome of the big fights.])
