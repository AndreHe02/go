(;B[dp]C[Playable but not really urgent in my opinion.. See the variation for a different way. If you play this out you get a group in the center (which may become weak) and prevent white from making a moyo. Since there was no danger of white making a moyo, I personally would not play this way.]
;W[qk]C[Now.. white tenukis in the bottom left. This is your chance.. see variation]

(;B[qn]C[Not sure about the direction.. variation.];W[qh];B[qf]

(;B[cm]LB[bq:A][cn:B]C[You *must* play the hane at A, whatever happens. "Hane at the head of two stones".
If you don't play hane, white will play hane. It's as easy as that.  See variation.

Even if you jump, with 3 liberties you should not make a thin shape like that, B would be better.]

;B[jq]C[There is no need to play this move. It makes bad shape. Count the liberties: Before the move you had 4, when white plays K2 you have three.

It's almost never good to play a move that forces your opponent to connect, maybe later you could have played K2 instead!]

(;B[fe]C[* loses a point. Commentary ends here. Since you lost by 0.5, you probably could have still won it, but the most important points were a long time before that. I think you could have made a lot more out of this game by playing some standard joseki.
Although some people criticize it, I personally think it's a good idea to learn the most
important joseki by heart at your strength. you could have just played them in this game to get an advantage. If your opponent deviates from the joseki, you can still try to punish it an rest assured that you made the correct moves.
You played very well when attacking the group on the left, but I think you finally lost the game in the bottom right corner by giving the wrong atari on move 163.]
