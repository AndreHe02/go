C[Dear reviewer,
I'm playing black and now I'm looking for the moves which has lead to my lost....

Hi Ralf,

I will start with my conclusion after having watched this game:

What happened was, that W gained too much territory in the lower left corner. The main reason for this wasn't wrong technique locally, but bad timing:

- Often you answered your opponent's moves which weren't sente or which were extremely small.
- you played endgame moves even in the early middlegame, of course, this let's your opponent gain tempo, if he doesn't blindly answer.

I think your technique in local fights and your reading skill is very good, so you should more focus on these general points, I guess you can improve very quickly by doing so. 

When you rewatch this game please think about these two points, and by considering them, if you still would make the same moves. I advice you to look at your game again without the comments first, and see, if you can find the times where this happened by yourself.

I haven't put many variations in this review, because I cannot find many mistakes in your local shapes.

Enjoy!];B[pc];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[jd]LB[qe:A][cn:B][qn:C]C[Have you a better suggestion?

well, it's an unusual move, but I can't say it is bad. A would be standard move or approaching at B or C.]

;W[cp];B[cf]LB[dl:A][dm:B]C[what does this move chieve? endgame again...

your corner is alright... so play somewhere else, with c4 in place invasion becomes harder, but you need it. I would have chosen A or B as Invasion point]
;W[bg];B[hp]LB[hr:A][or:B]C[ok, your 2 stones need life... but h4 is helping your oponnent stabilizing his moyo.

I would leve these two stones by now, instead still invade. late you might live with A or B or running into the center, there's no immediate danger.]
