C[I gave white massive low left corner.  I have been giving
my opponents giant candy centers.  Anyway, my problem seems to be balancing
securing my territory with getting some influence on the board.  I believe
my biggest mistake was at move #];B[pd];W[pp];B[dd];W[dp];B[qf]
MA[nc]C[the idea of a star point
opening - as I understand it - is broad influence outward and to the sides,
so it seems strange though not necessarily bad to see a corner enclosure
here... usually that move comes up a little later if W approaches at X and
B doesn't have room to expand on the right.  The most common moves here as
you probably know are Wh6 and the knights move approaches to whites star
point stones.];W[jd];B[hc];W[mc];B[jc]MA[cn]C[looking at the whole board now
might be the time to play at x, instead of nine - the star point stones on
the left are both looking across the left side at each other. W's group at
the top is still not settled, so if he tries to invade either of your top
enclosures, you can build strength to attack him. another possibility for 9
would be a line lower, to cut away at his base without making contact and
thereby giving him shape.];W[kc]C[It's possible to cut here - you make him stronger but your move 13
at the right starpoint is then sente, and though he is not entirely settled
after the sequence in the game he is light and hard to attack - his purpose
in this area is just to limit your territory.]
(;B[ic];W[ke];B[pj];W[ql]C[13 aims to attack the white stones at the top
but 14 seems to hit its weakness
squarely];B[pn]MA[qq][pq][nq][jq][jp][dq][cq][fq]C[15 feels like a bit of
an overplay to me - its floating, has few prospects for making territory,
and is unable to separate the white stones. admittedly you're worried about
W making too much territory there but the lower side and the corner are
still open, for instance at the points marked with an x... what about C6
now, or around the left side star point and then enter the lower
side?];W[qn];B[on];W[po];B[np];W[oq];B[nq];W[iq]C[what about a sequence like this?]

(;N[Figure];B[jq]MA[ol]C[this is where the heaviness of these stones starts to
show.  the ways things have gone its hard to treat them lightly and, say,
expand on the left side, but if you play to protect them I think its better
just to play at x and seal white in rather let him build a wall facing his
star point stone.];W[io]MA[ir]C[by making a one point jump white
leaves behind  some weakness - you can play underneath at x. of course it
seems too early to me to play this way, but then he comes back later and
attacks the weak stone thats left behind. overall the 23-24 exchange seems
bad for B - by itself it doesnt do that much to secure eye space and it
increases whites potential, as you clearly realized given your next
move.];B[cj]C[I think I should have gone around C 6 first and then jumped
back to here if W protected corner or take some corner if white went here
(of course I am not confident in my ability to get any of the corner)

even after this sequence, for a long time to come you can still
invade];W[cm]MA[cq][dq][fq]C[an invasion could still start at any of these
points - the one knights move from the star point threatens  to connect
underneath his left hand wall.];B[dg];W[jr]C[now its too late to use that
aji.... it would be unpleasant to let him capture this stone now, but
defending it lets him build up his moyo even more - rather than play 29 you
could still invade the corner and then do your best to pull your right side
stones out.];B[kq];W[jp];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[kn];B[qk]C[this move highlights the problems with the lower
side group - by pushing white outward you're forcing him to divide you. at
the beginning you mentioned you felt your biggest trouble was balancing
influence and secure territory, but the main problem for you in this game
was the group on the lower right. look back at the board around move 11-14
- white only has a couple star point stones, so why should they end up with
such an advantage lower side? patience is important (and difficult, an
area I often am lacking in...) - making steady strong approaches that work
well with your existing stones and limit your opponents expansion before
they can build up big frameworks.];W[pl];B[nl];W[he];B[gd];W[ge]
MA[pb][pc][of][oj]C[here he's returning the
favor - instead of invading moyo, he's helping you build it - 38 by itself
is not so bad  but I would want to take away the upper left corner while
there was still a chance, and if I was going to strengthen the upperside
white group why not follow 38 by cutting into the right at one of the
x's?];B[fe];W[fd];B[ed];W[hd];B[fc];W[dk];B[dj];W[ek]MA[hr]

invade the corner, in ko at the least.];B[fi];W[ob];B[pb];W[od]

(;B[qe]MA[qd]C[I think you could have played 61 at X and won the ensuing
fight. white probably has better moves than I put in the figure, but it
seems worth a try];W[pc];B[qd];W[qb];B[qc];W[pa];B[kh]C[This move would
probably be better where white goes next - Q9.];W[pk];B[qj]
;W[nk];B[ml];W[oj];B[mk];W[mj];B[kj]C[of course I have 20-20 hindsight when I'm
reviewing the game, so I can choose only predictions that come true... but
this situation shows how all the way at the beginning the sequencing
starting with move 15 created problems for you, and also how an extension
upward from that group closing white in could have had value even though it
might seem passive at the time.];W[kr];B[lq];W[ln];B[mn];W[no]

;B[lh]MA[bl][bm][hr][cq][cp][dq][gl][hm][os]C[much
of the mid game fighting on both sides is confused.  one of the big
challenges of go is always thinking about what's the most vital point I can
take, can I possibly ignore this move and play elsewhere? just taking 115
as an example, how important is it to save that one black stone in gote? I
marked some more valuable moves X, including possible invasion points. If
your worried that your invasion might not succeed, think of it this way -
if your trading him stone for stone inside his territory, without making
him much stronger on the outside, then your really not losing many
points...];W[hi];B[hj];W[gl];B[hl];W[gm];B[gk];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg]
