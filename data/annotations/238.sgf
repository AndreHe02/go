(;B[oc]C[This is an overplay.  You should just extend to P16, and play  the usual joseki.]
;W[nc]C[This is the "Honest" way to punish the overplay,  and is a few points better than the joseki.  You must answer at P16, then W  connects underneath.  W can cut and start a fight, or play S16 first, then  cut.]
;B[ob];W[od];B[rc];W[oe];B[oh];W[nb]C[w gains on upper side and weakensr14,  since q17 loses liberty
enables b q14.];B[pb];W[pm];B[om];W[qj]C[I would expect this move to be  at P8.]
;B[pj]C[This helps W make a nice shape st Q9 and P8.  Making contact  with weak enemy stones usually helps them get strong.  Think about Q8 instead  since W didn't save his stone.  They W and B will jump into teh center, but  after B jumps a few times, he can cut at O16, or just extend to around K16  for a big framework.]
;W[pk];B[oj]C[I let w q9 out to get r14.
but I am not sure if p9 works
better to keep the pressure
on q9 while not losing q14
option : b p9 w q11 b p10
w q12 b q13 w r11 b r13. (DAVID:) I like P10 better than P9 - it makes a nice  shape.  Your side was way too open to expect to kill W anyway.  And catching  R14 is too small now - only a gew points in Gote.  D5 would be bigger.  You  should be thinking about building thickness while chasing white, then cutting  at O16 for a much bigger capture.]
;W[ol];B[pf]C[Too small.  W's ponnuki in  the center is worth much more than the territory you get here.  You need to  play at O7.]

C[
 sen 23k*: r2 first ?

r2 not forcing. s7 gives life too and threats r9.];W[md];B[jc]C[This  extension is too close to W thickness.  If he invades behind, you can't make  a good extension.  I like G17 instead.]
;W[fc]C[hard for me to decide how to
play here.];B[fe]C[I chose a compromise between
strengthening d16 and k17.
after f16 joseki, k17 will be  cut. (DAVID:) F16 is bad since it is a contact play so W will get strong and  K17 will be weak.  F15 is not usually a good move so this just shows that K17  was too far.]
;W[gd];B[je]C[mutual pincer. in these
situation, it is crucial who
has his head out a bit farther.];W[ge];B[ne]C[6 pts in sente, why not ?]
;W[me];B[nd];W[lc];B[mf]C[big mistake. m14 is an advance
I have to answer near k14. (DAVID:) Yes.  Jump at K13.];W[lf]C[
 sen 23k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[if]C[
 z11 8k*: is entering byo-yomi

the fastest way I know to
advance with guarenteed
connection: diagonal, jump
alternating. (DAVID) Correct - also this direction puts more pressure on the  stones to the left.]
;W[ff];B[ee]C[too slow. I am thinking to  limit eye possibilities for
g15 chain while my line k
is pressed harder than his
line g.
if I want to extend on line d,
can I go to d13 or is d14
the farthest safe extension ? (DAVID: I like this move.  If you give up thsi  stone, then W becomes very strong.]
;W[gg];B[mg]C[same mistake again ! DAVID:  Yes.  You can pep right away at H14 then jump to J12.  Getting out is high  priority.]
;W[lg];B[ih];W[mh];B[eb];W[ng];B[gb]C[Since this move doesn't  connect it is small.  Play at D13 or E13 instead and take side territory  while attacking W.  Or you can play H18 threateneing to connect and making a  little shape...  You see the trouble your too long extension to K17 is  causing...]
;W[fb];B[fa];W[ib];B[gc];W[ic];B[fd]C[Too small.  You have to keep  the two upper W groups separated.  Once tey connect your stones are so weak  it will be hard to win.  Either your K stoens will die, or  he will make lots  of terr chasing them.  Play J16, then K18.]
;W[id];B[dh]C[big side ter, but line k
is a stick with no safe port.
I have to learn to see NOW
the big ter w will get on the
left by pressing the stick.];W[co]C[prepares to get ter on left. DAVID:  and also prepares for a big terr on bottom.  You can't invade with such a  weak group at the top.]
;B[jd];W[jb]C[a connecting move. g-j group
is now secure. very important  move.];B[hi];W[cg]C[clever invasion.  DAVID: shows that D12 was too far -  should be D13.  If W hadn't been able to connect his upper groups, he could  not invade...]
;B[df]C[is d13 better ?  DAVID: I like D13 better.  He will  have to crawl a ways on teh 3rd line.  You get stones at D13, D11, etc in  sente, and an easy connection to H11.  Also, this move followed by giving up  D12 gives W way too much terr on the left side.]
;W[dg]C[Once W pushes through  here you can see the big left side terr coming (and the B K group gets  weaker...)]
;B[eg];W[ch];B[fg]C[protects e14, so it is the
fastest advance to connect to h11];W[di];B[cf]C[I really don't know. he can  block an attempt to connect
to h11. I prevent further  invasion by b15, but he gets
a chance to take q8 and my stick
has nowhere to connect to.];W[eh];B[kq]C[I try to create a safe port to
h11 while invading. what I  get instead is another stick,
and even 2 connected sticks
are still potentially dead...

maybe n10 better  now.  DAVID: This invasion can only work if the W group to  the right is weak and has to rin out.  If your L3 stone gets surrounded and  has to live on the side then yor center group should die.  Even if l3 runs  away, W shoudl get a splitting attack.  This game looks already lost for B  now.  You gave W another ponnuki at D12, which means he will get a lot of  terr on left side.  General comments for you:  1) Don't give up ponnukis so  easily - it makes the opponent too strong.  2) Don't let the enemy connect  his weak group near your weak group.]

or I connect to p12 or I kill
m10.];W[km];B[li];W[mj];B[mi];W[nj];B[ni];W[kl]C[This is pretty small.   I'd play at F2 or F5.]
;B[fo]C[from now on I try to reduce
his ter. the crucial mistake
will be neglecting life of
q4.];W[gn];B[fp];W[en]C[Better just to play E6, without exchanging G6  for F4.]

(;B[pl]C[these few last moves were bad,
but this is game mistake.
I didn't see the life danger to
lower right group. (I can find
an excuse in time pressure :)
I think with q4 alive I win.  DAVID: yes, this is the last losing move.  I  think that  even if you live you are a little behind but yo are playing  better in the endgame so far, so maybe you can win.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[so]C[I  have now 2 tracks possible :
go for ko, or try to create
semeai by cutting off either
at l9 or at l6. I manage
badly both, and there goes
the game.  DAVID: there is no cut at L6/L9, and W can live on both sides  anyway, so you have to go for the ko.  Then you can use threats to cut  perhaps a ko threats.]
;B[po]C[Why not start a ko right away at T6?  Then this  move is a ko threat.]
