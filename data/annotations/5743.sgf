AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Hi

My name is Frank and I'll be reviewing your game.  My comments are prefixed [Frank\].  Some comments are made at the end of the game.

Enjoy.


hello  !

im 5k on kgs and i gave 5 stones to 10k player.

one of my problems is that im not good at playing handicap games , i try to think as big as possible but some times i end up losing even badly as in this game.

i request that you help me to understand which moves i should and shouldnt do in handicap games , what are small moves in this type of games and what is big.
also , in this game besides the fact that i lost a group in semiai , at the end of the game i realized that black's top was huge and it was too late to invade there (besides what i did) , but then again it seemed that there was no good time to invade earlier.

in any case hope you'll help me to improve in handicap games.

thanks in advance .];W[qf]C[likely [10k\]: gg];B[qh];W[of];B[nd]

(;B[pg];W[qi]
(;B[ph];W[pf];B[rd];W[mj]C[[Frank\] I don't think this is proper time for attack..B's group would be just fine with P8 while W's group has a weakness at S13.  

As W, I'd like to play elsewhere on the board.  That B group is very hard to attack effectively.

the correct side of the attack?];B[ol];W[pk]C[[Frank\] If however, you played N10 so B would play P8 so you could protect your weakness at S13 in sente, I applaud you ;)]

C[[Frank\] I don't know any josekis with this, but my recommendation is that if you want to try something new like this, try it with a stronger player.  In that way, you can figure out if what you're doing really works or not.  Personally, I'd have spent awhile on the next move and might decide to seal you in, let you live, and come in to your territory.  See variation from mv 73.

i know i should've moved to b5 instead , but i saw this move in quite few games , so wanted to try it.

can you show me the variations of this thing/shape? im also not sure if this is ko or 100% life?]

[Frank\] I believe the game was lost because you didn't have a broad enough view of the whole board.  Sometimes you attacked and just left your groups dangling.  This is okay sometimes in a handicapped game, but you still have to decide which groups you want and which you don't want.  When you see a stronger player leave a very weak group on the board to play elsewhere, it is likely they do not intend to save that group for the time being and if the opponent happened to kill it, it would be fine.  Still, you played fairly well in terms of trying to terrorize your opponent.  You just need to watch your own weaknesses too.]
