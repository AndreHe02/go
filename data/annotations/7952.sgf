C[track [3k\]: Have a good game

Hi Track,

my name is Ole a.k.a Zordon,
I reviewed your game and it was quite interesting.
My comments will be marked with my nickname. I also added some variations and ideas, please check them out.
If you have any questions about the review feel free to send me an email Ole.Juergensen@hotmail.de

There is a summary at the end of the game. Please make sure to read it also.

All the Best,
Zordon];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp]C[miyan [2k\]: hi];W[dd];B[oq];W[pj]
C[I learnt (pro-lecture) that this is a bad move. I would like to know whether I used it in the following sequence properly. Especially move 12 surprised me a bit. Maybe to choose another variation after move 12?

In my opinion move 10 is bad, because it helps me a lot.

Zordon:
If a pro says it's a bad move, thats probably true.
But I think its okay.
Move 10 is certainly bad.];B[ql];W[qf];B[nc]

(;B[qb]C[Here I thought whether it is bigger to play around F17/ F16/ G16 or to protect the upper side and the cut.
One concern was also W high stone at Q10.


Zordon:
After you forced white to build a solid group R18 is rather uninteresting. It is pretty big though. I would recommend F17 now.]
;W[jd]
(;B[hd]C[What about other moves here, like F16?

Zordon:
Whites move feels a little close to your strength, so I can understand your attack. I think your move looks quite okay.]
;W[fd]C[Zordon:
I don't see what's so interesting about the one step extension. Jump out to the center is better for both.]

;W[gb];B[kc]C[W got a nice area in upper left though it is still open at B16.

In my opnion B is leading in this moment:
- W is still open at B16
- B is controlling the center
- B has a lot of points at upper side and lower right

Is my judgement right?

Zordon:
Black is ahead. White did not gain so much in the top left but has a weak and heavy group now.]

I am not sure about this shape. H13 may be better. You cannot capture whites cutting stones with more move anyway.]

So why did white play the marrked stone?!]
(;B[gl]LB[hk:B][ho:A]C[Hm, right direction? And, if yes, right place? Other options I considered:
The reason for choosing this direction was that I thought B is leading, so I can calmly win this game.

Zordon:
I like the idea of A. But:

Its important to count now. If you are ahead you can afford to spend a move at B. If not you need to try something like A.
You can afford B now and to avoid further complications I would capture the stones.

With your move you invest the second stone to capture the cutting stones, but they are still not caught.]

C[Zordon:
White could have had the exchange black A, white B if he played correct.]
;W[cf]
(;B[ch]C[D12 doesnt work, and I planned to play C8 if W D13
But maybe it is just enough to play first around H5? Now, when I look again, H5 seems to be ok. B territory is bigger, W has still 2 open areas (C12 and C8), and any potential adji in the H5 area has disappeared.

Zordon:
You don't need to give white a chance like this. H5 is way better!]

If your central group really is in danger even after you invest another move at E10, then white should be able to kill you now. The marked stones are not important!]
;W[is]
(;B[ej]LB[ik:A]C[Here I considered also F12, actually I would like to have both points, then game over...

Zordon:
With A you can actually capture the cutting stones. See variations
But you might lose C12 on the way so I agree with F12.
Whites group is not in danger. But black is still ahead by quite some points.]
;W[hk]
(;B[gk]C[Now I think that F12 is much better, B has better eye-potential, C12 is connected what is much bigger than E8, actually then W would be dead in center if W takes E8.
Meaning I missed here game over. Right?

This is my last question.

Zordon:
E8 has no meaning what so ever.

C[track [3k\]: thank you for the game

Zordon:
Okay, interesting game.
I think white played weak for a 2k. especially the endgame was horrible.
Let's point out the biggest mistakes.

1. Don't push from behind like with Q14.
2. capture cutting stones if you can.
3. don't cling to small fish like K2 or E8 while risking whats really important.
4. count before risky moves. White came back into the game, because black played too risky at times.
5. The endgame is important. You won by 20 points but white lost about that much after move 150 by unnecessary mistakes.

And last but not least. If you can kill a huge group in the center, do it ^^

Best regards,
Zordon])
