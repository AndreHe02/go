AB[pd][dp][pp];W[dd]C[Lencio [15k?\]: hi! gg


- Hello Lencio, my name is ckrit, I'll be reviewing your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them via mail or on KGS. My nick is ShinLyuu there.]
;B[cf];W[gd]LB[fc:A][fd:B]C[- Normally one would repsond at A or B, but in handicap games you'll see unconventional moves more often.]
;B[di]C[zenka [12k?\]: you too];W[cq]C[- This invasion is too soon, since black will end up with a nice wall as you'll see.]
;B[cp]C[I thought of: "Block at the wider side".

- This is the right side indeed.];W[dq];B[eq];W[er];B[fq];W[fr]
;B[bq]C[Was this one wrong? Maybe i should have played G3 first?

- Yes you should have played at G3 first. Even if white keeps on running on the second line, he'll gain just one point in exchange for a mighty wall.]
(;W[br]C[- So this is a bit too submissive I feel. G3 is the right move for White.]
;B[bp];W[gq];B[fp]LB[gp:A]C[- Playing at A here is better shape.]
(;W[hr]LB[gp:A]C[- Pushing at A is more effective and the cut doesn't need to be protected either.]
;B[dl]LB[ic:B][pj:A][gp:C]TR[di]C["Influence needs an Extension"

- In Seong's wise words right? x) The idea is right, but you already have your connected at the marked stone. Maybe Playing at A or B are bigger. If you do want to play on the left side, C is definitely more important.
 If white does try to invade or reduce on the left side, the fight will be at his disatvantage and a reduction not too big at this time.]
;W[gp];B[fo];W[kq]LB[nc:B][qj:A]C[- This is too slow for white, he already has a strong group there, so why not just try to split the right side at A or try to fix his upper left shape by playing at B.]
;B[qj]LB[oj:B][pj:A]C[- I feel playing one line higher at A gives a nicer formation. Later on, white might be able to recuce at B if he wants to put emphasis on the center.]
;W[ql]C[- This is asking for trouble, jumping in between Black's stones like that.]
;B[qn];W[ol];B[oj];W[nn];B[pg]LB[nc:B][oq:A]TR[oj]C[- I'm not too sure about playing the marked stones, since white will invade next move and you'll end up with less than you should have. The bottom right corner is getting a bit lonesome as well now. Maybe Q13 at A to take the corner first and let white try to invade or approach at B.]
;W[qc]
(;B[qd]LB[pc:A]C[zenka [12k?\]: sorry

Again a block to the wider side.

- Normally you'd want to block at the wider side, but in this case it might be interesting to play another joseki and block at A. Look at the sequence one move back.]
;W[pc]C[Lencio [15k?\]: no problem
zenka [12k?\]: \]thx];B[oc];W[ob];B[nc];W[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[kc]
LB[lc:A]C[I wanted to make the upper side smaller for white...

- You can just keep extending at A here. If white plays at A now, it will only create unnecessary weaknesses in your shape. White gains one point with each move, but you get a formidable wall, so it's ok to just let him go on like this.]
;W[ic];B[kb]LB[lb:A]C[...so i cut the two groups.

- Just playing at A does the trick here, no reason to not make a strong tiger's mouth.]
;W[nq];B[pq]LB[pr:A]C[I wanted the corner to be save. I wasn't shure if i could connect on S8.

- Playing at A is bit more efficient, allows you to play better endgame later on.]
;W[or]LB[qr:A]C[- And now white can jump in later as well at A.]
;B[lj]LB[cc:A]C[I wanted to make territory in the upper right quarter.]
;W[ib]
(;B[bd]C[- Invading the corner straight away is bigger. Check the sequence one move back.]
;W[cc];B[rc]LB[pr:A]C[- A is more urgent, can't let White take away that groups base.]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[sc];B[mg]LB[pr:A]C[- I think this must've been a misclick? Still A is more urgent.]
;W[je];B[le];W[ke];B[me];W[ch]C[That was hard for me. I thought of C11 to block to the wider side or to block to the middle and connect at D12. After the game it think that D12 would have been better.]
(;B[ci]LB[dh:A]C[- Better to block at A, White shouldn't be able to live underneath. Check possible sequences.]
;W[dh];B[bh]C[I tried to connect with my two stones but it didn't work out the way i wanted it to.

- Not possible to connect];W[bg];B[cg]LB[bh:A]C[- This is a mistake, can't allow white to capture the marked stone.]
;W[bi];B[bj];W[ah];B[ee]LB[bf:A]C[Then i tried to run and attack at the same time.

- Difficult to fight here, bacause White can live easily by playing at A.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[eh];B[ei];W[fh];B[hh]C[I tried to cap him...]
;W[gf];B[gi];W[fi];B[fj];W[fg]LB[pr:A]C[That was a big win for white...

- This was a big loss for black, but white spends another useless move here, still a chance to play at A and hope for more mistakes by White.]
;B[hn]LB[pr:A]C[- Big, but A is still more urgent.];W[bc]LB[pr:A]
C[- Another useless move by White. Playing at A will make the game a lot closer, Black is still behind by a few points though.]
;B[cj]LB[aj:B][pr:A]C[- Still A is more urgent and bigger. The cut on the left doesn't work, so even then it's better to play at B to prevent White playing there.]
;W[ko];B[pr];W[oq];B[kl]LB[km:A]C[- A is a bit better shape and a 3-point difference.]
;W[jm];B[hl];W[jl];B[jj]LB[jk:A]C[- Blocking at A is more efficient.]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[ij];B[ji];W[ip];B[pn]LB[aj:A]C[- A is the biggest move now, if white played there it would be sente and possibly a ko too. Check sequence.]
(;W[pl];B[rl]LB[aj:A]C[- Still A is more important.

My review goes up until here, I hope it was helpful.];W[rk]
;B[rm];W[qk];B[rj];W[kk];B[jk]C[White could decide to give me the two stones or just one stone.]
;W[il];B[ll];W[nm];B[sk]C[I wanted them to be connected, because i thought that T9 would be a good endgame point for white.]
