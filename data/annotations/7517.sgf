C[Hello,
I am Amygdala. Thank you for reviewing my game. I will mark my questions with "A:".
I felt that I lost the game by the failed reduction of white's center moyo, but my fighting was also weak. It would be kind of you if you would answer my questions.

Hi there,
I am Tsinghua, I'll be the one reviewing. I'll try my best to point out the good and the bad, as well as trying to answer your questions. 
The opening was quite hard to comment on, but I did what I could :) Hope you can learn something from my comments!

I'll mark my comments with T, and if there is a variation, there will be a (v).]

(;B[cf]LB[dd:A]C[T:
At the moment, it is very popular for chinese players to play A now, however, it can become a very complicated game. (v)]
;W[cd];B[df];W[fc];B[dj]TR[qd]C[T:
The reason why I am not so keen with this result, is that the marked stone seems slightly out of place.]
;W[po];B[pl]LB[oq:A]C[A:
As I found out myself, the fuseki up to this point was at least played once before, in the 5th Ryusei cup between Nakaonoda and Hidaki. White played A next in that game. What do you think of the fuseki so far?

T:
For our level, the situation is still even :) 
The Pincer of Black 13 is very nice, as it correlates well, with the rest of the board.]
;W[mp]LB[oq:A]TR[pl]C[T:
This is locally correct, as White wants to settle. The marked stone cannot be attacked. As you mentioned, A is also possible, however, it is very complicated.]
;B[oo];W[on];B[no];W[pp];B[nq];W[qq];B[oq];W[nn];B[mo];W[rp]

(;B[jq]LB[fq:C][hq:A][iq:B]C[T:
This move I don't like. If white plays A next, the situation seems cramped for Black. (v) A and B are the standard extensions, C will start a fight, but it is still possible.]

(;W[od]
(;B[mc]LB[pf:B][qf:A][qg:C]TR[dc][fc]C[A:
Is there a better response? If so, why?

T:
Usually when white has played the low stones in the upper left corner, the upper side is considered uninteresting. Black cannot secure many points on the upper side, so it is better to just extend at A, B or C. (v)
However, this does return to my first comment of R16 being placed oddly.

However, white's next move is very difficult, and to be quite honest, I'm not at all sure how to handle this situation as white. I've made some suggestions, but I'm not satisfied with any of them.]

(;W[ne]C[T:
This is an old joseki move. Not considered good anymore.];B[qg]
;W[qc]C[A:
I was not sure which follow up I should choose.]
(;B[jc]C[T:
This is bad.];W[rd];B[qe]C[A:
A better alternative?

T:
No, the next few moves cannot be changed.];W[re];B[pc];W[pd]

;B[ob];W[le];B[kd]LB[lb:B][je:A]C[A:
I guess this one was wrong. Are A or B better?];W[lc]LB[lb:A]
C[T:
How about A for black now?];B[md];W[ld];B[me];W[mf];B[mb];W[nf]
;B[lf];W[ke]LB[ke:2][lf:1]C[T:
1-2 is a bad exchange for black. (v)];B[lb];W[kc];B[kb];W[jd]
LB[ic:B][lg:A]C[A:
I thought about A but refuted it because of B next.

T:
It is quite complicated, as the upper stones are very close to life. (v)]

(;B[ib]LB[ic:A]C[A:
This or rather A?

T:
I prefer A];W[ic];B[jb];W[lg];B[cn];W[kf];B[fq]LB[pi:A]C[T:
I think somewhere around A is rather urgent.];W[dn];B[dm];W[en]
;B[co];W[cp];B[gp];W[eq];B[qj]LB[er:A]TR[qd][qe][qf][rf][qg]
C[A:
I felt that I did not have the time to play A first. Are there better ways to stabilize the marked group?

T:
very good. Black has the lead now in territory now.
However, white seems strong in the center, so it will be easier for white to play with more risk than usual.]
;W[fr]
(;B[gr]LB[ep:A]C[T:
Considering the result in the game, it is probably worth considered to play A instead. (v)]
;W[fp];B[gq];W[bp];B[cm]C[A:
Was that the proper answer?

T:
Yes.];W[pi];B[qi];W[ok];B[lm]LB[qm:A]C[T:
A seems very big?];W[rl];B[rm];W[qm];B[ql];W[rk]LB[qk:A]TR[rm]
C[A:
Can I use the aji of the triangeled stone immediately?

T:
The cut at A is too urgent to defend.];B[pj];W[qn];B[ol];W[nl]
;B[nk];W[ml];B[nj];W[jo]LB[bf:A]C[T:
It may sound strange, but this move should be at A.];B[in];W[km]
;B[kn];W[ln];B[jn];W[ho];B[io];W[ll];B[lo]C[T:
Very nicely handled];W[ph];B[og];W[nh]LB[og:1][nh:2]C[T:
Again, 1-2 is an unecessary exchange];B[se];W[sc];B[rj]
(;W[gg]LB[bf:A]C[T:
A is alot bigger (v). There is no way either side should make territory in the center.]
;B[ed]C[A:
I still wonder if white really had to answer here...

T:
well, this move is not so active. I think white was happy to get 118.]
;W[gb];B[hc];W[id];B[hb]LB[eb:A]C[A:
Was that necessary at all?

T:
No, but it is quite big. A for later.];W[il];B[fi]LB[be:C][bf:B]
[dh:A]C[A:
I felt this move was somehow wasted, but I still worried about an invasion at A. What do you think about b123? Better choices?

T:
As hinted before, B and C are huge. However, this move is fine, it does 'enough'.]
;W[gi];B[gj];W[hi]C[A: I was wondering hot to reduce the white center now.]

(;B[ni]LB[lj:A]C[T:
A does actually work, I think you just misread a little :) (v)]

;W[oh];B[oj];W[pg]C[A:
I felt that I lost the game here.

T:
Yes, it's the final big loss. I'm sure that a better endgame could have made the game closer.]
;B[hj];W[ij];B[fh];W[hf];B[bo]LB[be:A]C[T:
A is bigger.];W[hn];B[hp];W[er];B[bf]LB[be:A]C[T:

[is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os]C[A:
Do you have any general remarks that could help me to improve my skills?

T:
Well, it's always hard to tell from one specific game, where you need to improve. White played very passively and didn't really take initiative at any point, so I think it's hard to judge your skill from this game especially.

In this game, it just seemed you made some typical slip-ups, and your endgame was lacking. Your opening seemed fine, and the middle game was not really very long.

If you have any questions or criticism, you can e-mail me.

Hope it was useful!])
