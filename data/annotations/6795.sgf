AB[pd][dp]C[Hi,



I was white in this game, and although I got lucky at the end I'm still in doubt about most of my moves during this game. Please tell me how to improve my josekis (in relation to my opening) and any mistakes I might have made. Thanks

Hi :) I'm glad I can help and will do my best :) Where are you from? I guess I will never know...]
;W[dd]C[Flameinice [2k\]: hi Raina [4k\]: hi];B[pp];W[cn];B[fp]
;W[dj]C[Of course, this is the correct play. But in a handicap I would choose some faster play, like another kakari (approach) to the top right stone.]
;B[ck]TR[dk][cl][dm]SQ[dl][cm]C[I was taken aback by this move because I haven't come across it before. How to respond?

Its good you haven't, since its wrong of course. This kind of bottom-kosumi (with regard to the d10 stone) can be used for invasions, when you don't expect much more than making life. In opening black should try for more.

Either block is possible, I would prefer the other. Most natural continuation follows and is clearly bad for black.

Genrally, triangles are right invasion spots, squares are wrong.]

(;W[dk];B[cm]C[Best resistence for black, not taking into account that its bad as whole.]

(;W[dm]C[This must be also possible.];B[bl]C[Another strange move by black. So strange I lost my wits and didn't know how to punish.

Wicked move :) needs some reading. Most simple would be D8 connection now, but doesn't work (variation)]

(;W[bm]C[Atari canot be good, after black connection you can cover both D8 and D6 cuts. If wan't to play it your way, connecting without the atari would be better.]
;B[cl];W[en];B[ci]
(;W[di]C[You are giving black easy time. You must attack him fiercly and try to force him to finally capture on b6, which would harm his corner a lot.]
;B[ch];W[nc]C[Should I have protected at C14 first?

now its late];B[bp]C[bad move from black.]
(;W[hq]C[This kind of move is good, but it's not too powerfull when black has the life-saving connection at b6.]
;B[gn]C[Keima is too weak, black cant play this loosely. Kosumi is normal.]
;W[fr]C[On your place, since you have the stones at c,e 5, I would play the e3 peep.]
;B[gq]C[Another move that I hardly ever come across. Bad result for white, or is he just helping me strengthen my stones?

Yes, this only helps white. Black normaly wants to save the corner by e3. Without this exchange, e2 later gives him chance to capture f3 next. Now the chance is lost.]
;W[gr];B[hp];W[iq]C[white is alive now, gift from black.];B[gl]
;W[eq];B[do];W[dn];B[gj]C[Black didn't read this. What does he plan to play against f5 cut?]
;W[fk];B[gh]C[It's not possible to ignore this kind of peep.]
;W[eg]C[D12 would be better as can be seen from the continuation.]
;B[cf];W[gk];B[hk];W[hl];B[fl]

C[Terrible result];W[dl];B[ee]C[Game switched from won to a bad one.]
;W[gg];B[ed]C[The F5 cut is still operational, but far not as good as could have been if used properly before.]
;W[fh];B[dc]C[White barely survived, gained nothing, while black gained lot of points. Chances to win now seem low.]
;W[qc]C[A desperate (therefore) bad move by me. Should have been around K16?

K16 area is not promissing at all. You cant get any points on the top with the weak cental group. The group can be left on its own for now and you should play away from it, so you don't damage it.

Problem is that san-san is very passive, you can't play like this if you want to win. For example q14 would be an active move.]

(;W[jd];B[jc];W[jg];B[ih];W[jh];B[ii];W[je];B[kc]C[The difference looks small, but it's a good example. The k16-k17 exchange lost lot of aji you had there. Quite possibly you might want to play k17 or L16 instead.]

(;W[pc]C[You should se that this direction is wrong. First - you don't need to play here at all, the san-san lives. Wall is nice, but not when its black to move and neutralize it.]
;B[lf];W[le];B[kf];W[jf];B[ke];W[kd];B[me];W[ld]C[No idea what black is trying]
;B[nf]C[Adding prisoners maybe]
(;W[lc]C[No need to answer, the group looks out also on the other side. You missed your chance here.]
;B[hc]C[Black answer here is way to small.];W[pj]C[Direction is right, but I think this is to soft on the black on the top.]
;B[ni];W[qn];B[ph]C[He caught his breath];W[nq];B[qk]C[His favourite move :)]

(;W[qi]C[right direction. but... (var)]

;W[qm];B[pl]C[B has no reason to answer this...];W[rg]C[Why this? Its a dead stone.]

(;B[mp]C[Also bad. Why do you respond to it, when you can take it?]

Thanks again,

Flameinice

Black lost lot of points on the botton right and he also let you connect the right side, that won you the game. You sliped with the left group earlier, but looks like the strength difference was vast enough to win the game anyway :)

Good luck with your go!])

Best connection is k15 obviously and you will have to play it (not generally, but I can't see any tricky sente connection here). If you imagine the move on the place, would you really want to play k16 next? Not really.]
