[cp];W[pp];B[dd];W[pd];B[eq];W[cj]L[ci][cf][ck]C[KHS : I  considered a to have a good kakari follow-up at b, but thought that c was too  good for
black.

Correct. Your move is the usual move here.];B[cl];W[cf]L[ch][cg][gc]
[jc]C[KHS : Perhaps too greedy. My plan was to go for influence if black was to  invade at a.   Both your move and the 2 point jump at `b' are common in professional games.  If the situation is
as open as here, `b' seems more common, and black often answers at `c' or  `d'. Your move is more  agressive, but if you know how to handle black `a', there is nothing wrong  with it (see the
variations)]
(;B[gc]L[ch]C[People tend to throw in  a stone at a to test whites response. The way black played here gives  white the chance to settle nicely (see the variations). To ignore black, as  you did, seems also
possible, but might run into problems if black invades at a next.]
(;W[pj];B[cd]C[This move just looks too complacant. An invasion is more severe. By  playing elsewhere again,  you gain a nice large-scale position, while black hoards all his stones on  the left.]
;W[jp]C[nice];B[ch];W[bh]L[bg][bi][dh]C[KHS : I anticipated  black a or b, and would respond by boxing him in or getting two eyes on the
side. Because of this, black c looks like a good move, forcing white to play  a and b and not even
be sure of two eyes.   Right. because black invested so many moves already, you don't mind if he  gains a bit here.]
;B[el]C[I would prefer to annoy the white group more  directly, possible with the move c you suggested
before. The move black played is not bad: it takes solid territory and sente,  aiming to jump  deep into whites loose formation. It does look a bit slow though.]
;W[dh]C[KHS  : Now white is thick. I was happy about this result, even though black got a  big moyo.

Agreed. This move is essential now.];B[nc];W[ld]L[kd][ne]C[KHS : This  move is a mistake. I hoped black would invade at san-san, but he wasn't so
cooperative. The resulting sequence is bad for white.

KP: A pincer seems a good idea here, but it should be further away, at `a'.  If black then  jumps out to `b', he can't attack as strongly. Another idea for white is the  keima at `b'.]
;B[ne];W[pf];B[ng];W[ph];B[jd]L[ke][lf][kf]C[KHS : Post game analysis  indicated that this is too slack. A or b seems better. I
particularily like b as it gives black good shape.

KP: Attacking from strength can't be good, and that is precisely what this  move is doing.
A black move at `b' instead looks better, but a little cramped. I would  prefer playing `c'.  That makes it harder for white to move out. I am not sure about `a'; it looks  like a  very severe attack if it works, but it might leave the possibility of a  counter-attack  (proverb: stay away from what you want to attack)]
;W[lf];B[lh];W[kg]L[kh][je]M[jd]C[KHS : Bad move as it just induces black a. b seems to be the  move for white here.

Yes!!! It is much better to lean on the marked stone, it is strong anyway.  The idea is to  get as much local shape as possible; a running fight looks unfavourable for  white.]
;B[kh];W[ig];B[ii]L[eh]C[Maybe it is better  to test whites response by playing `a' now, and then to continue the attack.]
;W[gg]C[KHS : Black has gotten the better of this exchange.. His mistake was  not putting his center thickness to better use. Had he done so, he should  have a comfortable win.]
;B[eg]L[eh]C[Misses the point I think, as it doesn't threaten the left side group. `a'  looks more  severe.]
;W[eh];B[hh]
(;W[gf]C[This move is the right idea, but you  should aim for lighter shape here. How about the sequence  shown in the variation (node 33)?]
;B[fh];W[gh];B[jf];W[if];B[jg];W[je]C[Nice dodge! This rather spoils the fun for black]
;B[ke];W[ie];B[kf]M[kd]L[kd]C[a move at `a' doesn't work.];W[ic]C[Another good move. This  sequence leaves black the proud captor of 3 stones, while white
breaks into the upper side and avoids serious damage. However, whites group  is still not  completely connected, and so I think the game is still a bit in blacks  favour.]
;B[kd];W[hc]L[id][ec]C[KHS : My opponent suggested after the game that a is  the proper move, aiming at nasty business in
the corner. The actual move leaves too many weaknesses.

Dix is right. The move at `a' is also almost sente, aiming at the HUGE move  at `b'.]
;B[gd];W[pc]L[qp]C[KHS : Correct timing I think. White has  to secure some points now.

I prefer `a' or somewhere thereabouts. That looks bigger.];B[qq]L[qn]
C[KHS : Surely black can do better than this. I would prefer kakari at a.  Black must have counted  and found himself sufficiently ahead to play safe.

Yes, this move is too complacant and fails to make use of blacks strength.  Maybe he didn't
expect your sente variation? `a' looks better.];W[qp];B[pq];W[nq]C[Good move!]
;B[nr]C[KHS : I wanted sente...];W[mq]
(;B[mr]C[I dont like this  second line crawling. The variation shown at node 54 looks preferable.  It also ends in gote, but it leaves some potential on the right side.]
;W[oq]L[rp]C[KHS : This move seems to be without purpose...

I don't think it is that bad. True, black won't play there in a hurry because  it would stop `a'  being sente, but I think that is a small point. You don't destroy much aji I  can see ...]
;B[or];W[mk]C[KHS : White feels he is in the game again..

Agreed.];B[kk]L[fi][fg][ll]C[Very bad move! Black should aim to use his  strength efficiently, not play in front of it.
Now seems to be the right time to play at `a' to split the white groups. The  connection at  `b' doesn't work too well, see the variation. In the process of chasing,  black should be  able to increase his bottom left corner and to get stones in place for a deep  invasion  into whites moyo, giving him a good game. If black insists on
invading immediately, `c' surely works better.]
(;W[ll];B[kl];W[fg]C[KHS :  Honte. Should probably have been played before. Now the white groups are  connected. Having
black connect here would be extremely uncomfortable, especially now that  black is building strength
in the center.

Yes. This move gets whites group out of trouble and puts him ahead. Blacks  previous move doesn't  threaten much on the right.]
;B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qn];B[lq];W[lp];B[kq];W[kp];B[km]L[jq][hq]C[KHS : I can't help but think that continueing at a  would be good enough for black.

The move black played looks pretty much like sente and can't be bad. But you  are right,
`a' or `b' (I prefer `b') should come soon.];W[lm];B[ob];W[bp]L[pb]C
[Interesting idea, but it looks tough trying to invade there. Answering  blacks move at `a'  is very big and shouldn't be put off for too long.]
;B[cq];W[co]M[bp]L[pb][be][bl][go]C[Not  convincing. I believe that black has better answers to this move than the one  he played.
I suggest going back to `a' or `b' now. Than you can decide on how to use the  potential of  your marked stone later. A move at `c' could prove interesting, and from the  centre I would  play at `d' immediately.]
;B[cn]L[eo]C[Hmmmmmm. I would be  tempted to play at `a' instead and invite white to  prove that he isn't simply throwing away points here.]
;W[dn];B[bn];W[go]C[KHS : Treating the invasion stones lightly.

Correct procedure. black played many low moves and can't easily dispose of  all threats  at once. Still, I think you were lucky to be able to get out in sente like  that.]
;B[eo];W[be]C[Nice idea! Black has his group to worry about if you  invade very deeply, so he is probably  right to defend as he does]
;B[bd];W[ad];B[qb];W[pb];B[pa];W[qc]L[rc][bc]C[KHS : Should be at a, as black soon will show me in the other corner.

This is true, but even better would be a move at `b'. Whatever he can do to  you, you can
do to him, and worse.];B[rb];W[rc];B[sb]L[ac]M[sb]C[`a' is more important. If  white plays at the marked place next, black can safely ignore him.]
;W[bc];B[cb];W[bb];B[ba];W[kb];B[lb];W[kc];B[lc];W[gq]M[go]L[hq]C[KHS : Huge

Yes it is. Black really should have played thereabouts himself. A black move  at `a' would  have threatened the marked stone too.]
;B[jr];W[ir]L[hp]C[Unfortunately a move somewhere there seems important.  `a' is a nasty threat otherwise.]
