C[Thank you for reviewing my game: I played black.  I think I made obvious mistakes at 59 and 109, but even if I hadn't made those I'm not sure I would have won.  Any advice you have for how to improve would be great.

Comments by Arlequin

Summary:
59 and 109 mistakes lost you the game. Without those tactical mistakes, the game would have been at least a close game.

From a strategic point of vew: you should take care of making your stones work together. You had some high stones oriented toward the center that were not working together making the center undeveloppable. Those stones become wasted moves in the endgame.
White gave you a good opportunity to attack his weak stones. But to make maximum benefit from the attack you have to see the whole board to choose the right direction of attack.

Your fuseki was quite good.

I hope my comments will be usefull.
Please continue to enjoy go :)

Arlequin - you make solid territory on top, but the marked stones are not efficient. they don't make point nor have prospect to attack the white stones on the bottom right (solid already). The white square stones destroy any prospect for black in the center. -> see previous variations focusing on center]
