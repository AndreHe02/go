C[Hello Bret.  My name is Eric (EricR on KGS), and I will be reviewing your game.  I will do my best to answer all of your questions, but I hope you do not mind if I also make comments about your opponent's moves as well.  Personally I find it useful to review games from the perspectives of both players.

If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to contact me on KGS or email me at Eric@cybersprocket.com.

I have prefixed all my comments with 'ER'.];B[pd]C[atticus [7k?\]: hi gg]
;W[dq];B[pp];W[qn]C[ER: This seems weird to me, but is probably fine.  If I were White, I would take the last corner and focus on a more territory-oriented opening.  Your two hoshi stones aim for a more influence-oriented opening.  So that dynamic would be a good one.]
;B[qj]
(;W[qk]C[ER: White's move is not joseki.  He has a variety of choices, such as jumping into the corner, which I have shown in the variation just as an example.  Please study responses to the three space low pincer if you are not familiar with them.  I feel it was a good move for you to play since it works well with Q16.  So you should know the common sequences so that you can continue to properly play out your strategy.]
;B[pj];W[pk];B[np];W[qg];B[oj];W[ok];B[nk]C[ER: A good, solid move.  This could have possibly also been at P9 earlier, but you would have had an earlier fight on your hands.  This seems good enough to me.]
;W[qe]
(;B[pe]C[ER: This feels like the wrong direction.  You have a wall at Q10 now.  You want to constrain your opponent within that wall.  By blocking this way you are effectively saying that you plan to make territory on the top, but you have no stones up there yet, so there is not much chance you can do this; White will surely get to play there before you do.  It is better for you to block the other direction and really put White in a cramped position.]
;W[pf];B[of];W[og];B[nf];W[ng];B[qd]C[ER: If you wanted the corner you should have played R16 instead of Q15.  Now you are committed to the top.  Letting White play N14 is very painful, unfortunately.  You can see how it makes the shape you have crumble inward.]
;W[mf];B[me]
(;W[mg];B[le];W[nj]C[I anticipated this cut when I played Black 25, but I thought getting fifth-line territory was better. 

ER: Yes, letting White get M15 would have been worse in my opinion.  But this is also not good for you, and is an indirect result of Q15.  Had that move been at R16, then White would not have been able to make himself a stable base here, and this fight would be harder for him.]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[rj];W[rk];B[mi];W[oi];B[lj];W[mk];B[lk];W[ml]
;B[lg]
(;W[oh];B[lf]C[ER: A large sacrific, but your moves worked towards a consistent strategy, so that's good.]
;W[dc]
(;B[de]C[ER:  This seems inconsistent though.  You just spent a lot of stones to get a nice wall towards the top.  You should consider coming it White from G17 or so instead.]
;W[gc]C[I didn't know how to respond here.

ER: I've shown one joseki in the variation.]
(;B[ec];W[eb];B[ed];W[cb];B[ic];W[kc]C[ER: Wild, I have to say, lol.]
(;B[gb];W[hb];B[hc];W[fb];B[ib];W[ga]C[White did what I wanted here, which is what I was hoping for with that sacrifice stone.]
;B[gd];W[jd];B[he]C[I wanted to chase here.

ER: Good idea.];W[id];B[hd];W[jf];B[if]TR[kc]C[Spoil the bamboo joint, tho because of the marked White stone it seems that it wasn't so effective.]
;W[jg];B[ig];W[jh]
(;B[jj]C[The stones in the center seemed the weakest, so I turned the direction of the chase this way.

ER: Not a bad idea.  But also consider that White cannot attack your middle stones without hurting himself.]
;W[ih];B[hh];W[ii];B[gj];W[ij];B[ik]
(;W[lh];B[li]C[I was feeling pretty good about the chase at this point.

ER: It's going well for you.  But when chasing like this, do not make yourself too thin.  Already there are signs of that, like the area around G10.]
;W[hk]
(;B[il]C[I feared all those cutting points...

ER: Good to be worried about them. :)  At some point you need to go ahead and cut off your opponent, and this looks like a good time.]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[gl];B[hn]C[Again, this group seemed the weakest so I developed from here.]
;W[lq];B[ll]C[ER: Strange that the last two moves have both avoided what his been the large chase so far.  White should have run a little more, and when he didn't, you should have applied pressure.]
;W[mm];B[lp];W[mq];B[mp];W[jq];B[lm];W[gq];B[fn];W[gm];B[gk]
C[ER: Try to avoid these types of exchanges.  You know White is going to play H8.  What is different after that?  You have two stones at J8 that are now one less liberty short, which makes a cut for White at K9 possibly more dangerous later.]

;W[cl];B[bo];W[dn];B[bn];W[do];B[eq];W[fm]C[ER: If you know you'll have to sacrifice, better to do it in a way that is going to best use the dead stones.  Here you could hane the other direction.]

ER: This seems fine.];W[nc]C[I can't believe this invasion lived; I feel like I should have been able to stop it.]
(;B[nd]C[ER: Usually the best thing to do in these situations is not touch your opponent, since it forces them to become stronger, gain more liberties.]

;B[sm];W[sl];B[qo];W[ro];B[po];W[ps];B[rl];W[sk];B[sj]C[This wasn't really sente, was it?  I got lucky then, I guess.

;W[kb];B[la]C[White thinks: "Black is dumbass.  He is connecting two living groups, so I'll play a bigger move now!"

ER: Your opponent should have seen this.  On the other hand, that you played this is bad because it specifically wastes a ko threat.]

StephenSun [7k\]: thx
atticus [6k?\]: quite dramatic!

ER: A good game.   I think you should work on your attacking the most.  During the chase in the game you left a lot of cutting points that came back to let White live.  And then during the invasion you didn't fight White off using all your strength.  Studying some tesuji for attacking stones should help you a lot I think.  Thanks for the game, it was fun to review.]
