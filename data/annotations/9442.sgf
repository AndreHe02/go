Hi Asaph,
I'm Simon, currently 6k EGF and around 2k KGS. I play on KGS as Hushfield, and my comments are marked with "H:"]
;B[dd];W[pd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qf]
(;W[qo]LB[nc:B][po:C][qo:A]C[A: since it is cross fuseki I didn't want black to get a large moyo
pincer better?

H: When I'm absolutely lost for direction of play in a position (as with unusual ones like this, I never play cross-fuseki) looking at pro games helps a lot. After a database search, in this exact position almost all pros play B, a very small percentage play C, yet none play A. I would say B is the right direction then.]
;B[nc]C[H: Black takes the nice point for himself now.];W[pf]
;B[pe]LB[qc:B][pg:A]C[H: While it's a move pros have been playing (rarely), it's almost always on a board that is much more full than this. In the openign stages, only A or B seem like natural choices for black.]
;W[qe];B[oe];W[rf]C[A: I made a mistake in joseki here.];B[qg]
;W[qc];B[og];W[op]LB[rd:A]C[A: was I right to tanuki?

H: In go, you tenuki, from the Japanese "te wo nuku": to pull your hand (and play somewhere else). A tanuki is a magical shapeshifting raccoon with a giant scrotum. True story.

To answer your question: while black can't use it to kill immediately, there is still a huge shape-defect at A. This might become a burden later (and potentially a huge supply of ko-threats for black. I would just be patient and play A.]
;B[re];W[qd];B[rg];W[rd];B[sf]
(;W[qq]LB[oc:C][oq:D][qq:A][rq:B]C[A: I dont think this was the right move becouse I'm ataching to a weak stone.
maby S3?
what is the right move here?

H: I would definitely say the right thing to do would be to protect your weak group in the top around C. (See variation.) If you're going to play in the lower right, white D seems very strong.]

(;B[qp]
(;W[pp]LB[pp:A][rp:B];B[rp];W[pr];B[rq];W[qr];B[po];W[ro];B[oo]
;W[oq];B[qn];W[rn];B[rm];W[qm];B[so];W[pn];B[sn]
(;W[qn]LB[qn:A][no:B]C[A: I think O5 here is better since at the end I sacrificed the R6 group anyway.

H: I disagree. See my variation on 42 for the reason.];B[rl]

(;W[no]C[H: This ladder doesn't work, but there's a tesuji called a "loose ladder" that allows you to catch the cutting stones.]
;B[on];W[nn];B[om]C[H: Compare this result with the variation. This missed opportunity is a disaster for white.]
;W[cf];B[ql]C[A: too slow for black

H: I completely agree.];W[fc]C[H: You say thank you for the black pass, and give him a taste of his own medicin.]
;B[ee];W[cc];B[dc];W[cd];B[gd]C[H: This black move is something which you see often in kyu player games, and it's something you should immediately exploit. You can force a lot of extra moves, gaining territory in the corner, influence outside and ofrcing black into overconcentrated shape.]

(;W[fq]LB[ip:B][gq:A]C[H: I like the direction very much, but I would prefer A, and consider B as well. A is better though, I think.]
;B[mq];W[rr]LB[lp:B][mp:C][kq:A]C[A: I misread this and thought S2 was sente.

H: Black has come too close to white's thickness. you should punish immediately with a move on that side. I prefer B here.]
;B[np];W[sq];B[pm];W[lo];B[ln];W[mp];B[nq];W[lq];B[mo];W[mn]
;B[mm];W[kn];B[lm];W[ko]C[A: I think this move was too slow, I thought I might have a librety problem.

H: It's a bit slow, but it's also super-solid. I don't mind this as much.]
;B[nm];W[mo];B[gq];W[gp]C[A: would F4 be better?];B[fp]LB[fo:H]
[go:G][ep:A][hp:F][eq:B][hq:E][fr:C][gr:D]C[A: what should white play here?

H: when somebody cross-cuts, your first instinct should be to take your hand away from the mouse, go make a cup of tea and make sure you're comfortable, because you now have a lot of reading to do. You have to read 4 different atari, and 4 different extensions. So apart from the move you played here, you also have to read (as far ahead as you can) a white move on the 8 marked spots. I usually find that an extension gives me a better result, as it gives black less atari shenanigans to work with.

Here, I like white B.]
(;W[fo];B[hp];W[go];B[ho];W[hn];B[in];W[gn];B[fr];W[eq];B[hr]
;W[iq]C[A: I think this is a mistake, I should have cut at J5 or hane at J7(?)]
;B[hq]
(;W[jp]LB[dj:A]C[A:too slow

H: indeed. Not even necessary. Imagine if it had been at A instead. You would have had 2 corners (and one corner - the upper right - which nobody wants to kill or save, apparently), a larger and less overconcetrated moyo than black.]
;B[ir];W[jr];B[im]
(;W[km]LB[km:A][io:B]C[H: I would indeed prefer B (see var)]
;B[io];W[hl]LB[dj:A][ck:B]C[H: This is far too ambitious. A black move at A or B can ruin the entire moyo.]
;B[jl];W[kl];B[jj];W[jk]C[A: not a good move on my side];B[ik]
;W[kk];B[il];W[hj];B[ij];W[eg];B[ce];W[be];B[df];W[dg];B[cg]
;W[de];B[ef];W[ce];B[ed];W[fg]C[A: I was pretty sure I could kill C13 as long that I didn't have a librety shortage.]
;B[ch];W[db]C[A: taking my sente.

H: But is it sente? Have a look at the variation to see how easy you make it for black to start destroying your framework. As black, what do I care about the lone white stone, if I have this much destruction to wage on your side of the board?]

(;B[eb];W[cb];B[gc]C[A: this was a mistake for black, but I didn't have time to utilize it right now.]
;W[cj]C[H: Finally! You got the important point in time.];B[hk]
LB[gk:A]C[A: what the best way to defend here?

H: the normal way. Leaving black to play A is a spineless move that shows no fighting spirit. It's also the pinnacle of bad shape. Have a look at the folowing page to learn more about ripped shapes: http://senseis.xmp.net/?LameDuGo]

(;W[fl];B[gj];W[fj];B[fk];W[ek];B[gk];W[fi]C[H: Compare this result with the variation. Notice how much you lost?]
;B[el];W[fm];B[dk];W[ej];B[dj];W[di];B[ci];W[ck];B[dl];W[cl]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[gi];W[hg]C[A: not to get serounded];B[fh];W[eh]
;B[gg];W[gh];B[gf];W[hh];B[ff];W[fh];B[hi];W[jg];B[jh]
(;W[if]LB[ie:A]C[H: this forces you into an empty triangle later. Try a lighter move at A instead.]
;B[ih];W[hf];B[kg];W[kf];B[lj];W[lg];B[kh];W[le]LB[oc:A]C[A: I think this is too slow.

H: Protecting the cut is big, but this might be time for a gentle reminder that your upper right corner has been dying for over 140 moves.]
;B[mf];W[lf];B[je];W[jf];B[md];W[kc];B[mh]
(;W[id]LB[od:A]TR[pf]C[H: this is small. You should try pushing at A to squeeze the aji out of the marked white stone (and save your corner)]
;B[ic];W[jc];B[ib];W[ob];B[oc];W[pb];B[rb]C[A: how do I handle this?

H: as staed before: by defending the initially faulty shape.]

(;W[nb]LB[mb:A]C[H: This is a big mistake. you can just connect at A.]
;B[mb];W[ma];B[qb];W[pc];B[la];W[na];B[lb];W[pa];B[sd];W[sc]
;B[rc];W[se];B[or];W[pq];B[sd]
(;W[mk]LB[od:A]C[A: this is probibly a mistake, but I couldn't find a big Ko threat.

H: there is a local ko threat at A];B[sb];W[ml]LB[fb:B][er:A]
C[A: from here it's Yose, if you don't mind I would be very happy if you can show me also the Yose mistakes and what are the best Yose moves.
thanks
Asaph

H: There wasn't all that much to say about the endgame, except for priority moves for white at A first, then at B being missed by both sides for quite some time. You keep sente for most of the endgame and your opponent missed a lot of opportunities to play at A.]
;B[nj];W[mj];B[mi];W[nk];B[oj];W[ok];B[pk];W[lh]LB[dr:A][cs:B]
C[H: This is small. Black is alive on both sides, so doesn't need to connect. Black will play at A or B.]
;B[li];W[mg]LB[dr:A][cs:B]C[H: Again, too small];B[ng];W[me]
LB[dr:A][cs:B]C[H: same thing.];B[ne];W[nf];B[of];W[lc]C[H: while sente, it's still small and removes a ko threat.]
;B[mc];W[fb]LB[er:A]C[H: finally, one of the 2 big points. I would have played A first though.]
;B[hd];W[ie];B[gb];W[ec];B[jb];W[fa];B[kb];W[fd];B[ge];W[kj]
LB[er:A];B[ki];W[er]C[H: you got both big points, and a whole lot of sente in between. Your opponent didn't punish your slow moves.]
