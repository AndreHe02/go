bazzone [24k?\]: have a good game

WayToGo [?\]: good luck];W[dq]C[bazzone [24k?\]: did u read the book "way to go"]

;W[oq];B[ec];W[hc];B[lc];W[he];B[df];W[cg];B[cf]C[al> the upper group is in no real danger, but the side is pretty open, so I think it would have been better to squeeze the black stone with something lika c11 instead.]
;W[bg];B[dg];W[ch];B[dh]C[al> black is pushing white toward black's weaker stones instead of reinforcing them at the same time as pushing white towards the stronger black stones (the corner) instead. White gets too much room to make a live group.]

;W[ak];B[af];W[ai]C[bazzone [24k?\]: nm
bazzone [24k?\]: dont accept it];B[dk];W[bj];B[bm]C[al> white b10 was unnecessary, giving black an extra move to connect properly, otherwise white could have attempted to split black by playing c7 for instance.

al> in return for allowing white to live, black has a very strong wall that should yield a fair number of points later, one way or another. Attacking the white upper group from the right seems to be a good idea, running it into the wall.]
;W[fc];B[eb]C[al> The black group (wall + corner is not likely to be killed, and the territory gained by defending like this is not very big. I think it woul be better to attack from the right instead.  Maybe L14 or something like that, would give black the opportunity to build a lot of territory in the upper right quadrant.]

;W[md];B[mc]C[al> If black would play m16 instead, that would threaten to cut white's n16 stone off. Now, white gets the chance to destroy black's potential territory in the upper right quarter of the board, or even build own territory there.]
;W[ld];B[nd];W[kd];B[kb]C[al> Black l18 is not necessary to save the black group, and it does not build much territory, compared to other possible moves on the board. P13 for instance, would build a moyo in the right side for black, and also  threaten to jump out and neutralize the white wall.]
;W[jb];B[ka];W[ja];B[lb]C[al> black m18 is not needed, and makes black lose tempo. Again, it would be better to build toward the center from the black stones on the right.]

C[al> black p12 is also a loss of tempo. what is important now is to stop white from building points in the middle. Since black has a solid wall along the D-line, it is possible to play something like j12 to accomplish this. Or H13, if you are less adventurous.]
;W[mf];B[of];W[nk];B[ok];W[mj];B[fg]C[al> "stay away from thickness" is the guideline. This measn stay away from both the opponent's thicknes as well as your own. H13, j13, j12 are possible moves that adheres to this.

al> After black f13, white can play exactly those moves himself, making territory in the middle.]

;W[lh];B[lm]C[al> There is no need to connect groups that are alive on their own. More important here is to push down white at the bottom, stopping him from getting to much territory there. Something like n4, maybe.]

;W[po];B[on];W[pp];B[km];W[nl]C[al> p8 is the move here, to seal the border.]
;B[mm]C[al> An unnecessary move. The best white could accomplish with playing n7 is a ko, so it is not urgent to play here.]
;W[ol];B[om]C[al> No groups is threatened, only territory, so it is more important to play Q8, than P7.]
;W[pl];B[ql];W[pk];B[oj]C[al> White would gain four points from killing those two stones. Black is losing a lot more points by saving them instead of closing the gate at r9.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[qj];B[qi];W[rj];B[ri];W[sj];B[sk]C[al> This is a classic mistake. T8 or s8 are the safe alternatives.]
;W[rl];B[rm];W[sl];B[si]C[al> Good. If white has played T11, it would have taken a few moves to stop him. Try it out.

al> But the mistake of letting white throw a tentacle into black's potential territory, cost black the game.

al> No more comments after this point.

al> overall, it was a pretty good game, for beginners. Two things is worth pointing out:
One is to remember to look at the whole board before making a move. It is too easy to get so invloved in local fighting, that one forgets that there are bigger points elsewhere on the board.
Two, it is not necessary to save all stones at all times. This last sequence is a good example of that. Sometimes it is better to let a stone or two go, than to lose more points by saving them. Most often, you lose tempo and initiative by trying to secure stones at all times.]
