;B[ce];W[dg];B[ee];W[gc];B[ge];W[cn];B[cl]M[cn]L[ep][jq]C[I'm a little skeptical about the  pincer here.  It's annoying that the marked stone
is parked right in front of any shimari you could make, but how about `a,'  with
the intension of following up at either `b' or the pincer, depending on  white's response?]
;W[el]L[en]C[White should have jumped out, possibly to  `a.'];B[dm];W
[dl];B[cm];W[dn];B[em];W[fo];B[en];W[eo];B[do];W[dp];B[co];W[dq];B[cq]C
[A much better result than I expected from the pincer.];W[fn];B[dj]L[qo]
[po]C[This is relatively small, now that the situation is settled.   A kakari at `a' or
`b' would be ideal.];W[fm];B[fl]C[Good cut.];W[jp];B[fk]C[Decisive, but slow.   You may be able to secure a lot of territory up here, but
only if the marked stone doesn't escape.  If that stone lives, your territory
in the upper left collapses, and this move is not quite so big.];W[de];B
[dd];W[df];B[ec]L[ed][cd]C[The hard connection at `a' is better, because then white  cannot atari at `b'.]
;W[cd];B[db]L[ed]C[Now you really  have no choice but to connect at `a.']
;W[ed];B[fd];W[dd];B[fc];W[cb];B[gd]L[hc]C[Unnecessary.  The marked stone can still pull out at `a.'   Better tp lay there
yourself.];W[ci];B[cj];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[qm]M[fk]C[Note how small  the marked stone has become after this exchange.  White's move here
is extremely big in comparison.];B[fh]L[mc][qd]C[This is small.  You're  getting a nice wall facing the center, but in gote.  If you
build a wall in gote, your opponent can easily mitigate its effectiveness.   I'd try
something like `a,' planning to either seal the corner (at `b') or secure a  large
territory on the top.];W[eg]C[White's move is also small, and now you've got  your wall in sente.]
;B[fg]L[jl]C[Much too small.  Perhaps an extension  from the lower edge of the wall, threatening
to either build a large center moyo or to invade white's territory at the  bottom.
Something like `a'?];W[pf];B[qe]L[nd][ph]C[This move is ineffective.  It doesn't  secure corner territory or attack white.
Either extend calmly to `a,' or try a pincer around `b.'];W[pe];B[od];W
[qd];B[qc];W[rd];B[rc];W[re];B[oe]L[me]C[Somewhat slow.  You can't really  pressure white's stones (they're not killable), so
you should aim at securing as much territroy as possible.  Perhaps `a.']
;W[of];B[me]L[le]M[oe][od]C[Too tight.  From a two stone  wall (the marked stones), make a two space extension, to `a.']
;W[nf];B[ne]C[White's moyo is getting quite large.  I think I'd invade now, and worry  later if
white pushes through here and cuts.];W[qi];B[mf];W[mg];B[lg]L[jl]C[At  this point, I think I would avoid the contact moves and play lightly in the  middle.
`A' is still looking attractive.];W[mh];B[lh];W[gl];B[mi];W[ni];B[nh];W
[ng];B[oh];W[mj];B[li];W[nk];B[oi]C[I don't think this gets anywhere, but it  does strengthen white.  Leave it for a ko
threat.];W[nj];B[qf];W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[qh];W[rh];B[qo]L[mq][kp]C
[I  think this is overly ambitious.  You're playing into a tight white pincer,  with only white stones around as far as you can see.  If you're interested in  a deep
invasion, I think I'd try `a.'

Even better, when playing into the heart of your opponent's strength, you can  try
contact moves, like `b,' playing lightly and sacrificing as necessary to get  something
to live.];W[po];B[pn];W[oo];B[qn];W[rp];B[pm];W[pl];B[ql];W[rm];B[ol]M[rm][qm]L[rl]C[Consider `a' instead.  The two marked stones die,  and you are assured of at least one eye.]

C[Hmmm...you seem to be forcing white to  take away your liberties, without being able
to launch an effective attack on white's corner stones.];W[op];B[lp];W[lo]
;B[ln];W[ko];B[np];W[no]L[mq]C[White should descend at `a' instead.]
;B[mq];W[nq];B[mp];W[qk];B[nn];W[nl];B[nm]L[on][jm]C[I'm not sure where  you can get eyes at this point.  Since you can connect out
either here or at `a,' why not run to `b'?];W[ik];B[nr];W[oq];B[jq]C[Good  move.  I hadn't considered this one.]

side is your main asset.];W[ih];B[ig];W[lf];B[jg];W[le];B[ld];W[hc];B[ke]

against the marked stones, beginning with `a.'];W[os];B[tt];W[tt]L[mn]
M[on][kn][jn]C[White lets you get an extra point at `a,' however, so I  guess it works out.
If all of the marked dame are filled, you have to connect.  (Of course, it's
polite to connect before your opponent fills every remaining dame.)];B[tt]
