AB[dd][pd][jj][dp][pp]C[Alfred (B) vs GnuGo (W) with 5 stones handicap.
What are one or two things that I can do to improve?  Thanks!]
;W[cn]
(;B[dk];W[en];B[pj]C[Black really needs to respond at F4 here.  White is threatening to seal in the corner.  Even if the corner lives, white's thickness would be very big.

Black doesn't have to worry too much about developing a moyo over there with F4, either, since white is almost forced to respond, since any followup from there would be severe.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[pg];B[oe];W[dg];B[fj]C[Should be pushing towards white instead?

- The bottom white group is stronger than it may appear, since the corner is weak.  If black tries to gain strength by leaning against it (using D7, for example), it could backfire when it becomes necessary to defend the corner.

Here, it might be interesting to try something like F13 or E14.  F10 doesn't put much pressure on white, and doesn't make territory.

Other things to consider:  the white stones in the top left and right are weak, but can still escape.  If black can chase one, building thickness to cut off the other one, then that would be worth a lot of territory, especially given the lower right corner's potential as well.

Consider where black will be trying to make territory, and where white has possibilities.  Right now, white is leaving several potential targets for attack, so take advantage of them!]
;W[nq]C[White seems determined to make as many isolated stones as possible.:)]
;B[oo];W[kq]
(;B[fq]C[Relatively small.  An attack on the isolated white stones at the top would be much larger, particularly since white still has moves to help settle the E6 group (B4, C8), as well as trying to run.]
;W[fc]
(;B[ee]C[The idea of keeping the white stones separated is correct, but consider the following:  the F17 stone has all the space on the top to run or make a base, while the D13 stone can't make a base as well (due to the D9 stones, as well as being on the fourth line).  

Hence, black probably wants to make a severe attack on the stone which is stronger (or more likely to escape anyway).  This way, the stones remain separated, but more importantly, black gains thickness which in turn is used to attack the weaker stone.]
;W[ci]
(;B[fg]C[This seems to be too easy on white, inviting him to connect the two groups together.  Black is still thin in many points, and the F17 stone can still extend along the top, which makes it unlikely black will make much territory there, which is the only reason to make a wall with F13.]
;W[ej];B[ek];W[fk]
(;B[gk]C[This is a big loss for black; it essentially sacrifices the E9 stones, which are cutting the two white groups.]
;W[fl];B[ei];W[dj];B[di];W[cj]
(;B[gi];W[ic]C[Black ends in gote, so loses the chance to mount a severe attack on the top.]
;B[ch];W[cg];B[dh];W[bh];B[cf];W[lc]
(;B[nc];W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[The right side is more important to defend; nobody will make much territory along the bottom, and white's O3 and L3 stones will neutralize any influence of a black wall facing them.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[rn]C[Black's too eager here.  Mistake here.

- Yes, though there are times this is good.];W[qn]
(;B[rp]C[Oops. Should try to save the atari first.

- Definitely have to connect here.];W[po];B[pn];W[qo];B[op]
;W[eh]C[Waste of a move by white:  loses a ko threat, forces black to connect anyway, and could actually lose a point if black later plays at E13.  Plus, the sequence starting with B13 still works.]
;B[fi];W[pm];B[on];W[rm];B[eg]C[Relatively small, especially compared with plays such as G8, G3, or around S9 or N15 (maybe even L16, if black is feeling bold).  Each helps expand black's territory while constraining white's.  Most have good followups, as well.

This move would have been a good time to evaluate the territorial balance.  

Black's corner is open in the upper left and right, so those could be worthless if invaded (particularly the upper left, as the thickness would be useless; the upper right could build a wall to take the side territory).

Black will get a bit in the lower left, and should get a lot from the upper right, and a little from the middle as well.  

Without going into exact point counts, it looks like white's left side will probably be a little bigger than one of the corners black is able to secure (assuming white invades the other).  The lower right corner is comparable with black's lower left.  That leaves the upper and lower sides to compete with black's left side.  Securing that area should be enough, especially if white's expansion can be contained.]
;W[bf]
(;B[ce];W[db];B[le];W[cc];B[be]C[This doesn't really accomplish much...white's groups are all safe, so keeping them separated does nothing, while a white play at B15 gains only a few points, in gote.

At this point, there are much bigger places to play.  White ignored M15, so a followup around L17 is interesting.  Simply securing the side with S9 is good, too.]

;W[ko];B[hn];W[or];B[pr];W[qr];B[om]C[Wrong way...now white's more likely to go into your territory.  The black group is weak, but can still lean against the O3 group first.]

;B[me];W[ps];B[nd];W[oi];B[oj];W[ng];B[qf]C[Good; this attacks white, and makes the corner pretty much impregnable.]
;W[lg]C[Oops - white is gaining a lot with this move.  It seems like I'm always one move too slow.

- Not really.  White still has to live; in the meantime, black can reinforce by putting pressure on the top white group.  White should probably be killed, but if not, then black should get compensation at the top.

If neither of these happens, then black probably should have defended at an earlier opportunity.]

Allowing white to live small in the corner would have been preferable; black would almost certainly have sente, the right side (which is bigger than the corner), and be able to play L17 to take compensation at the top.]

[il][jl][im][jm][in][ho][fr][gr][fs]C[Some considerations:

You had made the observation that you seemed always "one move behind."  This is often a case of reacting to plays that have no good followup, or playing relatively small points for immediate gain, rather than large points with much larger potential gains.  It's important to find where the more urgent points are, and take the earliest available opportunity to play them.  If you look back through the game, you'll find a few instances of this happening.

It's hard against a stronger player to do this sometimes, because there's a psychological factor at play.  Give it a try, though; step back and see what the followup play for a move is.  It may be that it will capture one or two stones, but if white ends in gote, you've essentially gained two moves somewhere else, in exchange for white's four or five points.

In the same vein, don't be attached to every stone played.  Stones that cut the opponent into weak groups can be very important, but others (such as white's stones in the upper right) can be sacrificed to gain a position somewhere else (the left side).

Follow up with attacks you've started.  White in this game had several weak groups all over the board.  By focusing on one, and keeping it separated, even if you don't kill it, you gain strength for a more severe attack on the next group.  It's hard to make territory while being chased around, but it's also hard to attack the opponent.

Note that plays on the 4-4 point are generally for influence and not territory.  One way to look at them is as if they had already been invaded by the opponent, and build your framework on the outside accordingly.  Look to use them as a starting point for a large territory along the sides or center if white invades (which will only be worth about 5-10 points for him).

Finally, be aware that playing a computer is a little different from playing a human.  The computer will know joseki, life and death patterns, and endgame sequences quite well, but is unable to judge well in the middle part of the game what points are important.  Take advantage of that whenever you can, and strike at the biggest points when the opportunity presents itself.

Good luck!])
