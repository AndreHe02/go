C[*seinosuke*: Hello.
JuanLopez: hi
---
I play black. I have problems to effectively attack a weak group. I would like to improve this point. Thank you in advance]
;B[pc];W[dq];B[cd];W[qp];B[do];W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[gq]
LB[eq:A][er:B][fr:C]C[White G3 is a rather greedy move. 

It seems that white got 2 more points (as compared with F3) but giving away too much of usage for black.

You have the right to play black A, white B, black C later.]
;B[dj];W[cg]C[This white stone enter in my side. The attack start here]
;B[ci]C[Good move.];W[eg];B[ed];W[gc]LB[fe:A]C[I am goint to bent in the G17 stone to get strong at top

Black A is another option.];B[gd];W[fc];B[ec];W[hd];B[fd]LB[ic:A]
TR[cg][eg]C[White A better, more solid, less usage for black.

When you have weak piece nearby, you have to exercise prudence.]
;W[jc];B[he];W[id]LB[fh:A]TR[cg][eg]C[Black should have captured the 2 marked stones at A.

Pls look at the variation.]
(;B[gg]C[Wrong direction.];W[fh]LB[fj:A][gj:B]C[You chose to let White escape.

A or B is the wrong direction, pls look at the variation.]
(;B[gj]C[Maybe was better in F10?

Yes as in better shape, but still the wrong direction.];W[gi]
LB[fj:A]C[Black A still better.

Since now you cannot seal and capture, you have to take care of your own shape.]
;B[hj];W[hi]LB[fj:A]C[Still Black A.];B[ig];W[ij];B[ik];W[ii]
LB[hl:A]C[Now, black A better.];B[jk]LB[hl:A]C[Black A is the shape now, there is a cutting point at H9.]
;W[fj];B[fk];W[ek]C[Now, your shape actually collapsed.];B[ej]
;W[fi];B[fl]LB[hl:A]TR[jk]C[Now you should be able to understand...

Black K9 should be placed at A.];W[el]LB[hk:A]C[White should have just cut at A, E8 is not necessary.]
;B[em]C[Maybe F7 was better?

Yes, better aji.];W[hk];B[gk];W[hl];B[gm];W[hm];B[hn];W[im]
LB[jm:A]C[White A better.];B[in];W[jm];B[eq]C[I start this sequence to get sente.  He get strong below.]
;W[er]LB[dp:A][fr:B]C[Black A is helping move, rather you should play B.

Pls refer to the variation.]
(;B[dp];W[cr];B[fq];W[fr];B[gp];W[hp];B[hq];W[gr];B[go];W[iq]
;B[jn]C[This was the point];W[km];B[lk];W[ki];B[jj]LB[jh:A]
[kj:B]C[Not sure this is good

It is crude move actually.

You give up the options of peeping at A or possible eye-shape move at B.

You only play this kind of move, when your opponent threaten to cut.]
;W[ji];B[kg];W[mi];B[lo];W[mm];B[nk];W[kn];B[ko];W[mo]LB[mn:A]
C[White should play A instead of N5.

You should cut at A now.];B[ln];W[lm];B[lj]C[?];W[li]
(;B[nn]C[Maybe N6 was better

Yes, definitely.

Pls look at the variation at the previous move.];W[mn];B[nm]
LB[pk:B][nl:A]TR[nn]C[What if white play A?

You should simply jump out at B.

The marked stone is a light stone, give it up.];W[no];B[oj]
;W[oi];B[pi]LB[oh:A]C[White A better.];W[nj];B[oh]LB[ni:A][ok:B]
C[White has no choice but to play A.

White B is a wrong move, allowing black to capture at A.];W[ok]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[mk];W[nh];B[oi];W[ng];B[lg]C[Good move.];W[mg]
;B[pf];W[me];B[kd]C[Maybe he is already connected

No, white is certainly in danger.];W[ld]LB[kc:A]C[If you play A, white will have more trouble settling the group.]
;B[lf]LB[oe:A]C[This is a bad move actually, since white A is sente.]
;W[oe];B[pe]LB[kc:A]C[White should have play A.];W[ke];B[le]
LB[kc:C][md:A][je:B]TR[ke]C[Silly of white to play B.

Just connect at A, when black capture the marked stone at B.

White C safely home.

You just can't save all the stones when playing Go, give up those non-important ones, save only those crucial stones.]
;W[je]C[I guess this was bad for white

Yes, asking for trouble.];B[md];W[lc]LB[ne:D][if:C][fg:A][dh:B]
TR[le][lf][cg][eg][kg][lg]C[Ok, look carefully here.

You should play A first, this is preparation.

Reason being the weakness at C, White is able to capture the 4 key stones to ensure the safety of the group.

In actual play, white can only play D and you cut the 2 marked White stones at E12.

If White insist to save the 2 marked stones at B, then you can just play D to kill the whole group.

Pls look at the variation on why black has to play A.]
(;B[nd];W[od];B[oc];W[pd]
(;B[qd]LB[qd:A][ne:B]C[I guess this was the must important mistake. Please, see the other continuation.

I agree with you.];W[ne];B[nc]LB[if:A]C[Maybe N18 was better?

No, N18 nice shape but mean more trouble for black.

Here, white A better.];W[jg];B[jf];W[jh]LB[ie:A][kf:B]C[You should have play A, white can't cut at B.]
;B[kf];W[pg];B[qg];W[og]LB[qf:A]C[Black A better.];B[qh];W[qe]
;B[qf];W[qc];B[rd];W[rc];B[re];W[pb]C[At this point, you lose the race to capture.]

Black A better.];W[rn];B[oo]C[Maybe Q4 was better?

Yes.];W[op];B[pp];W[pq]
