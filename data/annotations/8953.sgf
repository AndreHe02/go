(;W[or]C[See variation.];B[np];W[cj]LB[qj:a][pi:b]C[I think this opening is more favourable for White, because Black's thickness on the right seems inefficient with the K4 stone. What do you think?


//Yes I also think it is favourable for White, but only slightly. the ponnuki near the centre is big. 

White also wants to play a checking extension around A or B to fight against the Black ponnuki's influence.]
;B[nr];W[pr];B[qi];W[co];B[eo];W[en];B[fn];W[fo]C[Is there any variation after this that White can consider? I'm no good with crosscuts.

//Crosscut here is a mistake I think. Black can solidify the bottom. Black can choose what happens after crosscut.]
;B[dn];W[do];B[ep];W[em];B[gn]C[This is a reasonable outcome from the crosscut, but I think Black has a better result out of it because the Black is higher(sixth line) and the extension stone is fourth line.]
(;W[dm]C[Overcautious.];B[jn]C[The black bottom area is about 45 points.]
;W[jc]C[What do you think about the opening stage? My opinion is that Black is rather quite inefficient on the bottom side, and White seems to be quite spreaded out. But Black could form a big moyo on the right

Black is overconcentrated but has a lot of points. White is probably slightly ahead(but behind on territory).]

;W[mi]C[For this move, I was trying to stop black's progress on the right, and limit black's influence on the bottom, while extending from my top, and overall preventing black from getting a big moyo. I think this move is quite well played. What are your thoughts?

Yes it is the right move. It is even more urgent than the exchanges in the bottom left corner.]

Yes.]

(;B[nl]
(;W[ll]C[I don't think this exchange is good for white. Should white play this move (102) at J8 to limit black's expansion at the bottom? Now white is in gote, giving black a chance to proceed to the centre.

It's slow for White to connect here.];B[jh]

That's fine. The best solution was to realise that Black is not alive at the top.

The next best alternative was to just capture the stone(which is a big overplay).

This is the best alternative after that.]
(;B[he]C[Now that I think of it, The cut at M11 for black seems promising. Perhaps white should have defended against the cutting point first?]

At this point white is leading by around 30 points. I think it's probably due to the opening stage. Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks for reviewing this game!


//The opening was okay. I think it was more even than you seem to think. You gained a lot of points from pushing against the right side and making the upper right big. And also a lot of points from chasing out the overplay around A and making the left side larger.

The key thing that could be improved in this game was to learn more about shape and life and death, because the upper side black group was attackable throughout the game.

Another thing that could be improved was realising that the overplay at around A could have been captured outright.

Thanks for sending in the review. It was a pleasure.])
