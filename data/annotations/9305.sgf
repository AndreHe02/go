(;W[og]LB[qc:A]TR[oe]C[gp: Probably should have played at A and just have been content with the corner. This probably was too greedy with the marked stone already there.

No i do not think so, i prefer this to san san for both players se variation.]

(;B[nh]LB[ql:A][co:B]C[Exchange 11 to 12 makes 2 stones at top weak.

I have added few fighting variations.

In case i decided to give up the 2 stones, i'd prefer to strengthen q11 with something like A.

Tenuki might olso be possible in the case.];W[nf];B[md];W[nd]

(;B[lf]LB[ne:A][co:B][jp:C]C[eh: probably should have played at A, but I was attempting to build thickness on the inside

Loks like it is too late for A see variation. But thickness is not working also as far as i see.
White k16 or something around both threatens it and make it useless.

i think kakari B is the best idea instead, or a second wing C]

(;W[ob];B[pg]C[eh: this is a better result than I probably should have received considering my mistakes. I was able to get my thickness on the inside and keep a large portion of the right side

gp: Yeah, I feel I played this opening sequence rather poorly. I ended up giving black too much influence on this side of the board.

this is definatly good for black];W[oh]LB[fc:H][jc:E][jd:D]

Remember 
1) take the coners. (done)
2) shimari or kakari (a,i,h)
3) Big points in the centers of sides (b-g)

If you are to continue fight here invasion F is big. Protection at J also.]

;B[do]LB[kf:A][ni:B]C[at last 11 moves :-)

By the way black thikness at uppe right looks strong, but it is fragile.
Cuts at A and B are unpleasant each alone, if white cuts at both places black's position is going to crumble as a house of cards.]

(;W[co];B[cn];W[cp]TR[eo];B[eo]LB[ci:B][dn:A][fq:C]C[eh: I played the extension the marked stone because I have the ladder and assumed that B and C with miai.

I do not think this is good for black. White do not realy need to cut here.]

(;W[gq]LB[fq:A]C[gp: I should have played at A. I jumped too far out. Black never cut here, but it weighed on me the entire game.

Disagree this jump is vary natural for 3rd line. I think it is solid enough here. 

But i think it is slow now to jump here.];B[ci]C[Good move.]
;W[cg];B[eh]LB[kf:A][ni:B]C[eh: I felt uneasy about this knights move for some reason. thought maybe it was being greedy

No it is not bad at all. You have to support your c11 and you continue building influence.
Also you still can take san san unless white will send one more move in the coner.

Main thing you have to consider here is your weaknesses at A and B]
;W[eg]C[White is playing a black's game for him and conner is still open.]
;B[fh]
(;W[go]LB[kq:A]C[gp: I played here because I was worried about giving black too much influence in the center. I wonder if I shouldn't have played around A which would have secured more territory and gave me a base to launch attacks into the right side of the board.

Ya you had to instead of G3 :-)]
(;B[hp]C[I am not sure this is good time for this.

I'd prefer just to protect yours.];W[gp]
(;B[jo]C[I think this is too greedy];W[ip]LB[ho:A]C[eh: I probably should have played at A and allowed a connection underneath here. The bit of thickness gained by white here was instrumental in my loss.

As a rule of thumb you are not to save your kikasi stone. So J5 as is looks ok. It continues the idea of K5.]

(;B[jg]C[eh: I was very proud of this move at the time but because of whites liberties I was ultimatly unable to stop this push.

Hmmm not sure it is good. You have to cut first and then fight to kill.

Also i thnk you had to take C17 at some point after 60 but before this.]

[fh]C[I eventually lost this marked group and should have done more at this point to secure it. perhaps A or B. instead I hane around the played stone and force white to attack.

Ya, group looks not ok, but switching purely deffencive now might be equals to resign.]

maybe, not sure. It is a comlicated fight and it is hard to calculate one.]

(;W[gk];B[ej];W[fk]
(;B[gi]LB[ek:A]C[eh: while this move makes good shape I think A would be better here so as to stop the direct push

(;B[cj];W[di]C[yes, black lets a white worm in his body.];B[hc]

(;B[ch]LB[dh:A]C[eh: this is obviously a terrible move. A would have at least left a cutting point

maybe, both not doing much.];W[dh];B[bn]C[I'd check for weaknesses of your zone before this yose moves.]

(;W[be];B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[cf];B[bb]C[gp: I felt I could have handled this corner invasion better. I was waiting for the 3-3 invasion at some point earlier, thinking if black could undermine my form in the top left, he could potentially reconnect his form in the middle. At this point though, I was connected out so this didn't bother me too much.

Yes see variation. Do not hurry to atary, all you need is to prevent 2 ayes. even 1 aye is ok.]
;W[ad];B[bc];W[eb];B[ca]C[eh: after the loss of my large group I realized that I needed the top left corner so I was very pleased with this invasion

You had to do it much earlier. you'd get more points in the coner, and white'd have to protect himself, not fighting to kill your big group.]

(;W[oo]LB[qj:B][qm:A][qn:C]C[eh: I expected an invasion around A so I was very pleased with whites move here.

gp: yeah, I was unsure about how to invade here. I thought about B also, threatening to connect with my stones there, then follow up with C. Ultimately, I chose this because I thought Black's wall had a few weaknesses. I felt if I could get enough stones to work with here, even if I couldn't make life locally, I could exploit those weaknesses.

I do not think this invasion is good. looks like a free sente to fix black's weaknesses.]

(;W[ln];B[mm];W[jk]C[eh: uh oh

I have already added few ways it works without faworable ledder.]

eh: with no place to make up the difference I figured I should resign at this point. overall I thought I played well but overplayed at certain key points which left devastating weaknesses which white exploited to my demise.

gp: I was not pleased with my game here, despite the win. I allowed black to have massive moyo on the right, which forced me into an awkward invasion.

Eric, yes you have to take effort to defence, also you have to measure the worth of things you fight for.
territory in the center worth much less the it looks like. Remember 6 stones might give you 9 points in the coner 4 at side and only 2 in the center.
big moyo in the center always will have a lot of weaknesses, you will have to give up part of it to fix them. But this trade must be inishiated by you and go on your terms. Symbolicaly speaking your loss is caused by B6 move.

Greg, the moyo itself is ok. It is only a style of play. We have seen a lot of variations of the invasion one of them must occures, and this happands.
Your issue is the slow moves. You are like Achiles that actualy can not catch the turtle. Then you are to get something, look around maybe you can do few sente moves befor your main byte to make things better. There always things valueble for opponent. You can show a threat, hi will defent and you takes more.

Both of you might be interested in reading about fuseki. Something like a book "Direction of play" (or of game, not sure i have it in russian)

Have a good games in a new year and come back for new reviews.]
