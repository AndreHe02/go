C[Hello,

I'm most interested in the direction of play in the opening and middle game, and would like to know how to think about the moves I make, ie. the purpose of each move.

In the upper right and top I don't think my moves were very effective. In the lower right I again made poor decisions.

Thank you for reviewing my game.

Ian:
Thanks for the chance to review this game. The notes that you have made (I assume afterwards) are by-and-large correct - you had a pretty decent sense of direction in the first part of the game, but got distracted at the top, when the white thickness on the bottom needed to be used. 

Then later, when you had a decisive lead, you got sucked into an unnecessary fight where your territory on the left disappeared, and black had a good chance of maybe killing a big group. At about move 100 simplifying the game would have been advantageous - ensuring the right hand group had 2 eyes, taking territory along the lhs.

Overall I think that you played pretty well but that you could have made better use of the thickness on the bottom before it got eliminated. Everybody at all strengths finds working out the right direction and the biggest places to play tough, but also one of the most enjoyable parts of go. To get a perspective of the whole board in the middle game, I find that counting is helpful. It makes you consider the whole board and give you a feel for where are the places where the most territory could be.]

;W[dp];B[pk];W[nc]LB[qf:C][po:A][jp:B]C[chimchim: I'm not familiar with the Chinese opening. Not sure how to approach the corners.

I wouldn't worry about it being the chinese open, just think where are natural places to respond. Yours loks like a perfectly decent move, supported by the e17 stone.

Any of A, B or C also look reasonable.];B[ne]
(;W[ld]LB[qc:B][lf:A]C[chimchim: After B's response at A this doesn't seem so good. Invade at B instead or move somewhere else?

if you're going into B anyway, perhaps doing it directly makes more sense]
;B[lf]C[chimchim: B's moyo growing. W not getting enough in compensation it seems.

It's a bit early to say that, but black's moyo developing down the right is clearly an issue you need to deal with sooner rather than later]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[this must surely be the wrong direction - black wants a moyo along the right hand side here.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[qf];W[rf];B[rg];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc]
LB[qg:A]TR[rg]C[chimchim: W corner seems alive. Marked stone makes me a little uncomfortable though. Also leaves a cutting point at A which I don't know how or when to take advantage of it, or if it's possible.

When the time is right, the clamp, as in the variation, is the obvious way to use this aji.]

(;W[mp]LB[po:B][jp:A]C[I like this move :-)
I tihnk that the idea behind it is to make the points A and B miai.]

(;B[qh]C[going back to patch up your shape is generally not regarded as a good idea. Black gives you the initiative]
;W[po];B[np]LB[oo:B][jp:A]C[This sort of position (in the bottom right corner) is not uncommon in a chinese style fuseki, although usually black will have another stone at A.

This sequence is the trickiest in the game, as I have found it - your move looks odd, but proves surprisingly effective as played. The key is the aji of the Q5 stone - if you can use this, then you have done well; if it just gets swallowed up, then black has some compensation. For what it's worth, B is a more usual move by black here i think]

(;W[mo]LB[qq:A]C[chimchim: This doesn't seem too good. A better? Maybe exchange corner for outside influence or vice versa, instead of giving B big corner.

 W has extra move here so W has a slight advantage. W should get more out of any exchange, I think.

with the black position menacing from above, you're unlikely to get a huge advantage - think of it like a 5-4 point approach, where the natural direction for white is impeded above by the thickness. In my view, if you can just break even in this corner, then you should be ahead, because you have two stones in the virgin territory on the left.]
;B[no];W[nn];B[on];W[nm]
(;B[om];W[nl];B[nq];W[mq]C[black now has a conundrum - the white Q5 stone has a lot of aji left but taking gote to eliminate it is painful]
;B[ke]C[chimchim: Too slow and too close to B thickness?

the bottom white moyo is clearly the biggest thing on the board right now. The two stones are small and uninteresting]

(;W[dj]TR[nc][ld]C[chimchim: Big point. I feel I can treat marked stones lightly and sacrifice them if necessary. How about enclosing upper left?

good move.
the top is small
enclosing the top left is not as big as here];B[jd]C[chimchim: Seems slow and too close to thickness again. Small way to capture 2 stones.

yup]
(;W[jc]LB[oa:B][cd:A]C[chimchim: Since B is making slow moves to capture I could probably take another big point. A move at A maybe? Saving this group doesn't seem like a good idea. B seems to get more out of this exchange.

yup, these stones are still small. as you show, black has not even killed them yet, so he will need another move- that would be three moves to take maybe 20 points on top - 7 points a move. pretty small if you ask me.]

;W[fd]C[chimchim: This seems very slow and only helps B.

once the corner is alive, the bottom is biggest. actually, the bottom might be bigger than the top left even before you play c16. You're right that this move is not very interesting]
;B[fe];W[gd];B[ge];W[dd]C[a shame to take gote here];B[nj]C[chimchim: Seems to be taking territory with thickness.

well, black's gotta take territory somewhere :-) - still the bottom moyo is the biggest place to play i think]

(;W[qq]LB[lk:A]C[chimchim: I didn't know where to move at this point so I made this move, which seems unreasonable. A seems like a good move which expands W's moyo and reduces B's territory at the same time.

i don't think this is unreasonable - it's complex, but there's clearly a lot of aji here. i think that the timing is pretty good, too. 

after the black mistake on top, you ought to be ahead, the black moyo in the middle is likely to be smaller than it looks - a move to enlarge the moyo on the bottom and left might be the patient correct way to play]

;B[rm];W[ql];B[qn];W[pn];B[qk];W[rl];B[sm]
(;W[iq]C[chimchim: Again, not sure of best move. Also, not sure how to use thickness on right. It doesn't seem to be too effective now.

The thickness on the right is no more! It's now a one eyed group that might potentially become a problem later. The time to use the thickness was earlier, before black got into your moyo. 

This move is in effect threatening a live group - not very effective. I would play a tighter extension on the left to take territory there. You've got a won game here (you have 40 points on top, plus the lhs, black has maybe 25 in the middle, maybe less, 20 or so on the bottom right) so you should be simplifying.]
;B[gq]C[black needs to mix things up to win, your move helps him do so.]
;W[io];B[go]
(;W[fp]C[chimchim: Is this a good peep?

I don't what the objective of this move is - i don'tlike it much. the j3/j5 stones are potentially weak, so this might help black attack them later]
;B[gp];W[hm];B[ko];W[kp]C[funny move. It's not obvious why this is a good idea.]

[this is getting into a complex fight - just what black needs to stand  a chance of winning...\]]

maybe f3 is also worth considering.];B[gr]

around A seems better direction - take territory whilst attacking]
