AB[dd][pd][dp]C[*X*: Hi.  Alex here, or Xopods as I'm known on IGS/KGS.  Handicap games are good for learning about how to play thick, solid moves (honte) and then use them to attack.  Without having looked at the game yet, I can predict that the lesson to learn will be "make a fist, then strike."

My comments will be preceeded by *X*: (for Xopods) to distinguish them from yours.  Hope they're helpful.

----

I'm playing black in this game against a member of my local go club. We play ocasionally and usually keep it at 3 stones. I am about 11k AGA (13k online).

I feel I made some strategic mistakes early by trying to be greedy and save all of my stones and territory. I lost a large group this way. I would especially like commentary about my mistakes that led to this loss and where I went wrong. I suspect is was earlier than I think.

I would also like your comments about other aspects of the game in general, good and bad for both players, as I will likely share this review with my opponent.

Thanks,

Tom Obenchain
(RazorBrain)];W[oq]C[*X*: Unconventional, but not neccessarily wrong.  With this move, White intends to make the bottom side of the board the focus of upcoming moves.]
;B[jd]C[*X*: Wrong direction of play.  The bottom side of the board is important, due to White's choice of mokuzuhashi.  K4 is large, but will provoke White to make a shimari at R4.  You could play at R4 instead, which will probably end up with you taking the corner and White getting thickness facing left along the bottom.  You'd then have to do something to counter it.

If you want to play san-ren-sei, I think D10 might be better, because then you're getting influence in the right place to counter whatever White gets on the bottom side.  Of course, White's influence helps him to erase the moyo you'll get, which is why I'm not sure.

In any case, it's a dan-level strategic point, so maybe you don't have to worry too much about it.]
;W[qp]C[*X*: Seems natural, though White could also approach the bottom left.  It seems a bit slow for a handicap game though.  If Black plays D10 now, White has only one corner of the board, while Black has a moyo along two whole sides.]
;B[pj]C[*X*: The point in front of the shimari is big, indeed, but now White gets to play on the left.  I think D10 would be more natural.  Then, if White takes Q10, you play K4 and White has let your moyo get completely out of hand.]
;W[cn]C[*X*: This is okay... if I was playing White, though, I would have chosen wariuchi at C10.]
;B[cl];W[cf]C[*X*: This looks bad to me.  If Black now plays a second pincer at e.g. D12, his stones are coordinating well.]
;B[ce]C[*X*: UGH!  No no no!  This is the first horrible move I've seen so far.  This kosumi-tsuke move is almost always wrong, but very common among weak players.

The idea behind this move is that it essentially forces White D14.  If you can then attack the White stones severely, the C15-D14 exchange has served to make White heavy.  However, after this kosumi-tsuke, you need a defensive move at F17 or F16, because your shape is weak (imagine White E16).  If you play such a defensive move, White gets to play C10, a perfect extension from his two-stone wall AND a counter-pincer on C8.

Furthermore, even if you have a stone at F17 or F16, White can still invade C17 after this exchange.

I can't stress enough how bad this move is.  The only time it's playable is if you already have a stone around F17, so you can immediately pincer after White plays D14.  Similarly, it's also playable if you already have a stone around C-D 10-12, since you can then defend, and already have a pincer stone in place.  If you have a stone at neither of these places, then White will get one or the other and C15 becomes a bad move.]

(;W[ci]C[*X*: Fortunately for you, White answers with another terrible move.  See variations.]

(;B[dn]C[*X*: D14 is bigger than any move on the board right now.  You must play D14.]
;W[cm];B[dm];W[cp];B[cq];W[do];B[eo];W[co];B[eq];W[bl]LB[dl:A]
C[*X*: Yeah, this is submissive.  White should cut.

I think ignoring the cut at A ws a mistake.]
(;B[jq]C[*X*: Wrong time to tenuki.  If White's willing to crawl on the second line, Black should be pleased to push him.  See variation.]
;W[dl];B[el];W[ck]C[*X*: I think that one stone was more important than you gave it credit for.  White is now very strong on the side and your wall has further weaknesses.]
;B[df]C[*X*: Finally!  However, the weaknesses in your bottom side wall are urgent to fix.  This is probably bigger though.]
;W[ek];B[fm]C[*X*: F8 better shape.];W[fl];B[em];W[gm];B[gl]
;W[fk];B[gn];W[hm];B[hn];W[im];B[hk]C[*X*: Too early to pull out this stone.  White J6 is very severe.]
;W[gk]C[*X*: Bad move.  Strengthens Black, removes a liberty for the White stones below, removes the option of atari from the other side later.]
;B[hl]
(;W[qf]C[*X*: Very inconsistent.  If White is going to atari at G9, White should continue to threaten the stones with H10.]

(;B[qd]C[*X*: Fine, though, incidentally, now is a time when R15 is actually playable, because you have a pincer stone Q10 in place already.]
;W[qi]C[*X*: Bad!  Exchanging this for R10 makes Black heavy.  Weak players often think in terms of "two-space extension on the third line makes a base."  That doesn't hold true if Black has a stone at Q10.]
;B[qj]C[*X*: Right.];W[nc]C[*X*: White Q11 would make White heavy and awkward... but exchanging R11 for R10 without playing Q11 or something is just an out-and-out loss.]
;B[of]C[*X*: Maybe P15 here is better, even though it looks slower.]
;W[pb];B[qb];W[kc]C[*X*: Again with this nonsense!  Please tell your friend that you can't make two-space extensions like this when there's a stone at K16.]
;B[jc]C[*X*: Right.];W[oe]C[*X*: No.];B[pf]C[*X*: Right.];W[pe]
;B[qe];W[rf];B[re];W[pi];B[oi];W[oh]
(;B[nh]C[*X*: No.];W[og];B[nf];W[ng];B[nd]C[*X*: I guess you sort of have to take these two stones now... but do you consider this a success?  White is bursting through your lines, and your stones on the right side will be in danger soon.]
;W[oc];B[od];W[ni];B[oj];W[mh]C[*X*: Good.  At least you realise that this was a failure.  The cut at Q12 was the critical move.  However, you didn't have to try so hard to kill him.  You could have chased him out, sealing White's top group in while doing so.  Then the top group would die a natural death.

----

This sequence to this point was frustrating. I was trying to kill the white group as I felt that he didn't really have the room, but as we played, I felt that going fo rthe kill was not getting me anywhere and I contented myself with progress at the top. How could I have played this better?]
;B[qn];W[hj]C[*X*: Obviously, you have to answer this, since you committed yourself earlier to saving these stones.  However, keep in mind that the cut at Q12 is still available to you in future.]
;B[jl]C[*X*: Good.];W[jm];B[jk]LB[on:B][oo:A]TR[hk][gl][hl]
C[*X*: No.  The marked stones are cutting stones.  Once you spent a move at H9 to run out with the original cutting stone, you have committed yourself to saving them.  You cannot throw them away.

----

In hind sight I feel this was the beginnings of my mistake with the bottom right. I feel I should have played at A or B instead of trying to save the marked stones.]
;W[on]C[*X*: It's an odd-looking move by White... but White is strong in the corner.  No good can come of trying to push through at Q5.  You can cut at Q12 whenever you need to make eyes for the P10 stones, so you can give up R6 in return for capturing the J7 stones.

Now white gets there first and my troubles start. I try to punch through and separate this white stone and I am unsuccessful. I think this exchange only makes things worse for my stones in the middle. By the time I come to my senses, I am in even deeper trouble here.]

;W[kp];B[jp]LB[rj:B][rn:A]C[Here I am just following obediently along. I am trying to avoid problems with the bottom left but I have ignored the danger to my left side group. I feel I should have played A and B in sente to secure a room for eyes. Arrrrgh!!!]
;W[rn]
(;B[qm]C[*X*: Good call!  Looked to me as if the hane at S7 would work, but upon investigating it, I find that you actually do have to submit here.]
;W[rm]
(;B[rl]C[*X*: Clearly wrong.  R8 lives, one way or another.  See variation.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[rk]C[*X*: Painful.];B[pl];W[qk];B[rj];W[me]C[*X*: Now I don't think even the cut at Q12 will save you.]

(;B[ne];W[md];B[mf];W[gc];B[ec];W[ge];B[ri]
(;W[pg]C[*X*: This move looks wrong, but is actually right!  I would have thought White should play Q12 instead, but that turns out to be wrong.  See variations on this and previous move.]

(;B[lc];W[kd];B[mc];W[ld];B[kb];W[jb]C[*X*: Har har.  White thinks he's so clever.]
;B[lb]C[*X*: But you are more clever. :-)];W[ib];B[ke]C[*X*: Yeah.  Seems like you can't save it, but maybe you should try.  R13 will at least get you two stones in sente, and if White answers incorrectly, you can connect up with the group on the right, which will be enough to win.

----

So I've given up on the bottom right. But the loss of a group this size hurts a lot. I have now focused on trying to gain some compensation at the top. After this move I plan to try to attack the remain white stones at the top.]
;W[rh]C[*X*: Now, all hope is lost.];B[gg];W[ee];B[ef]C[*X*: Good!  "Resist kikashi" is a useful principle.]
;W[ff];B[fg]C[*X*: Normally, I'd say this is bad, since White can cut in sente.  However, connecting lets White escape, and killing the top side is probably your only chance to win, so...]

(;W[if]C[*X*: White should cut you in sente.  See variation.]

;B[eb];W[fb];B[ed];W[gd]C[I didn't kill them, but I felt like I got reasonable results.]
;B[mj];W[nj];B[lk]C[*X*: Small. C13, L3 much bigger.];W[mk]
C[*X*: Small.];B[lj]C[*X*: Small.  With all these moves, both players are squabbling over a few points in a near-worthless area of the board.]
;W[ll]TR[lj][mj][lk]C[*X*: I was going to say "small", but actually, you do have to answer this, or else you'll lose the three marked stones.  Still, White is wasting a ko threat.  Better to leave this unplayed for now, since it's his sente whenever he wants it.]

(;B[kl];W[jg];B[lg];W[lh];B[kg];W[jh];B[kh];W[ii];B[gj]C[*X*: I'm also lazy about reading. This is a pretty simple ladder though... you should be able to see it at a glance.

---

An opponent recently commented that I like to cut without reading out the situation to see if it works. I admitted that I often cut on instinct, As I am a lazy reader :-) So if you are wondering, this is my next demon to expel! More tsumego, eh!]
;W[gi];B[fj]
(;W[fi];B[ej];W[dk]C[*X*: This works too, for White. Seems like more aji than the ladder, though.]
;B[dh];W[ei];B[di];W[dj];B[ch];W[eh];B[eg];W[bh]C[*X*: White is being greedy.]

;B[bf];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[cb];W[kj];B[kk];W[ki];B[kq]C[*X*: Good, but should have been played earlier.  This has been one of the biggest points on the board for some time now.  B3 is also huge.]

;W[gq];B[gp];W[fp];B[fq];W[hq];B[ip]
(;W[dr]C[*X*: White takes a major loss here.  White should just play B3 in sente.  This is the game-losing move for White.

I checked out how the rest of the endgame would likely go if White played B3 (see variation).  I just did it quickly, so there are undoubtedly better moves for both players, but my way comes out with White winning by 1.5.  It would be a close game, anyway, probably a narrow win for White, whereas in the actual game, it's a decisive win for Black.]

;B[le];W[ka];B[la];W[hh]C[*X*: Umm... hello?  K19?  If you play a hane-keshi like L19, you have to connect it.  The exchange L19-M19 is pure loss for White if he doesn't connect.]
;B[ig]C[*X*: K19.];W[gh]C[*X*: This is, what?  Half a point in gote?  K19!!!!]
;B[ih]C[*X*: One point gote.  K19!!!];W[ji]C[*X*: ZERO points sente, or one point gote.  K19, for the love of god.]
;B[qq]C[*X*: Nonsense.  Playing garbage moves like this in the endgame is a bad habit  you should break yourself of.  The attitude of "it can't lose me anything, so I'll just try it and see" is detrimental to acquiring good reading abilities.  Furthermore, it loses ko threats.  And, perhaps most importantly at amateur levels, it's just plain rude, since it implies a belief that your opponent might blunder and lose something that should have been safe.  Even if he does, and it's enough to win the game, how good can you feel about winning in such a way?]
;W[rq];B[qr];W[rr];B[ja]C[*X*: Finally!];W[ia];B[ka];W[mm];B[mi]
C[*X*: Well, as you said yourself, you need to read more.  Also, there were points in this game where both players were playing small (1-2 pt.) gote moves while moves worth 5-10 points or more were available elsewhere.  Make sure that you are playing the biggest local move *in the biggest area of the board*.  I can't stress that enough.

And unlearn that awful kosumi-tsuke! (C15)

P.S. L14 is still worth 1 point.  The game isn't over.
