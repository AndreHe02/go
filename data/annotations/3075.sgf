C[Hi
This is a game I recently played on KGS. White (me) won the game on time but it's played all the way to the end. I hope to get some comments about my game, and mabye even suggestions on what areas of my game to improve.  /Magix (KÃ¥re Krig)

Hi, this is Nate (yip on KGS).  

One big concept to think about is playing large points, and not getting too involved in local positions.  Sometimes, you can afford to sacrifice a few unimportant stones in order to get an important play elsewhere.  There were a few times during the game that both players could have made much bigger plays, but instead chose to make many small ones in local fights.]
;B[dp]C[Magix [10k\]: Hi];W[pp];B[dd];W[pc];B[dj];W[qi];B[jp]
;W[jd];B[nq];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[lp]C[This seems overconcentrated for black.  The stones on the lower side still need more moves to actually make territory, since it's still open to being reduced or invaded on the left side.

If black feels that a play around here is warranted, something like O5 would be better; this controls white's influence as well as expanding his territory (and potential) more.  There's no great point for black to expand the lower side's territory now, while white can take a point like K10 which will restrict black even more, while giving white a huge moyo.

Playing around Q15 is also interesting, to see what white's response will be.]
;W[fc];B[dg]C[An odd response.  It doesn't help the corner at all, and doesn't do much to help the side, either.  If white were to invade (a bit early for that right now), then black would either have the side territory decimated, or allow white to connect underneath and result in an overconcentated position.]
;W[fe]C[Good; this restricts black's development, protects against an invasion, and allows white to exploit the position further.]
;B[pe]
(;W[nd]C[P16 would probably be more severe.  If black pushes, white should be happy to keep extending along the fourth line.]
;B[qh]
(;W[ph]C[White should just pull back here.  There's no need to be overly aggressive, since black's in for a tough time of it anyway.]
;B[qg];W[qd];B[qe];W[oh];B[pg];W[nf];B[of]
(;W[rh]C[Simply descending to S11 is better; now when black plays S13, white ends in gote.]
;B[rg];W[ri];B[rd];W[rc]
(;B[re]
(;W[sg]C[Could white have killed black here?

Unless black could have been killed I think white should have just built a more secure wall closing white in. Looks like white was the one to profit on the invasion.


[yip\]
I believe so; see the variations.  Black should have been able to live in the first place with T15, though (previous variations).]
;B[sf];W[qf]C[No idea what I was thinking here. Looked like a stupid move the moment I placed the stone.]
;B[sd]C[Overall, it's not a horrible result for white; black has 5 points of territory out of it, while white's positions have improved a bit:  a play around O6 would make the lower right very strong, and the upper side can be expanded even more.

White's positions are still a little thin, though - as are black's.  Looking at the arrangement of all the stones here, a play around the center of the board would give white a good lead in potential territory (neither side has much definite area surrounded yet), as well as aiming at invasions at black's thinner spots around C6, F3, and C17.  It would also serve as aid against a black invasion, and take away the only real area black has to expand into.]
;W[fq]C[With this play, black should aim to build thickness towards the center.  By doing so, he should be able to counter with an invasion of his own - probably around Q8, or make use of the aji around P17.]
;B[eq];W[fp];B[dm];W[iq];B[jq]C[Black's stones look really clumped together now.  There's hardly any territory to be had on the side at this point, so a more interesting play would be leaning against the white stones on the right side; this would build thickness, and restrict white's development.]
;W[ir];B[jr];W[cq];B[cp]C[Very poor choice of direction; black has spent six stones on the bottom to surround perhaps 12 points of territory.  The only possible reason to play K3 and K2 would be to attack the white F3 stones - but now, he's letting them link up with the corner!

Even if black gets the side territory, white should have that and more from the upper side and bottom right - especially given that black has no good points to expand to, while almost any white play will increase his potential territory.]
;W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[pl]
(;W[ql]C[White is already strong around here; he shouldn't be trying to make black stronger as well.  Just pushing black towards the thick position above should be fine.]

(;B[qm];W[rl];B[pm];W[qn];B[rm];W[rk];B[rn];W[ro];B[on];W[ol]
C[The white stones in the corner look a lot weaker than the ones above.  Not only that, but white is creating lots of cutting points, while driving black towards the safe position at the bottom.]

(;B[ok];W[om]C[White is trying too hard here.  His position ends up as a shambles trying to capture the black stones.]
;B[pj];W[nk];B[nj];W[qj];B[nl];W[nm]C[Black can probably get a reasonable result here by connecting now at Q9.]

(;B[mk];W[pk]C[Winning this ko will be almost impossible for white; black has too many local threats.]

(;B[nn];W[mm];B[qk];W[rf];B[sh];W[pk];B[mn];W[sn];B[qk];W[bq]
C[Small compared with the potential on the right at this point.  A more aggressive move like C6 or D15 is probably necessary.]
;B[pk]C[This must be a big failure by white. Lots of stones feel weak. But since black ignored my threat I felt like I had to use that.


[yip\]
None of the white stones on the right side are very useful now; all they're doing is connecting, rather than securing territory.  Black is also strong in the center now.  White's in for a hard time at this point.  Black T7 is very big, since it threatens a cut at Q11 as well as a play like S4.

Rather than try so hard to kill the black stones, white should have been content to chase them through neutral territory in the center of the board..]
;W[bo]C[Black does better to just let the four stones go, and play T7.]

(;B[bp];W[ap];B[co];W[bn];B[cn]C[Now black is just chasing white through his own moyo, pushing from behind.]
;W[bm]
(;B[pi];W[sm];B[si];W[rj];B[bk]C[Not very large or effective...white can still jump into the corner at the topm and black gets very little on the side.]
;W[lm]C[Not a good play; white should just let these stones go.  What possible use are they?  The black group they're cutting off is strong, because of O13.

Simply sliding into the upper left should be fine for white; if black responds, white can play another move at the top to futher secure the area.]
;B[jm];W[ln];B[mo]C[Bad shape here; N4 or M5 is better.];W[jl]
;B[kl];W[km]
(;B[ll];W[jn];B[im];W[in];B[ip];W[hm];B[il];W[go];B[hp]C[Considering how large the upper side is compared with down here, H4 is a small move.  Even if black follows up with G2, white should get two excellent moves elsewhere.]

(;W[hq]C[Not very effective; G2 would be better, though the two stones are hardly worth saving at this point.]
;B[hn];W[ho];B[gn];W[io];B[gp]C[Black is just wasting moves and ko threats here.]
;W[fo]C[F6 seems like a better move. That would connect and keep sente.


[yip\]
True, but white has a nice followup here at F7 now.];B[gq]C[Still small for both sides compared with other points.]

(;W[gr];B[is]C[The H3 stone hasn't done anything but consume a liberty, and G2 was played anyway.]
;W[hr];B[ko]C[Another wasted ko threat.];W[kn];B[fn];W[jg]C[Not a bad play; black has some potential in the center now, but is very thick, so holding back to K14, or reducing around F13 would be better.  A play around the left side has the added advantage of threatening an invasion by attaching at D14 or D12.  The upper left corner is still a large area as well, since black E17 would threaten white's upper side.]
;B[ng]C[Very small.  Black is playing right next to his thickness; white can be happy just to force black to capture the two stones, and reinforce the upper side.]
;W[mg];B[nh]C[Black has spent two moves to gain 5 points, while at the same time inviting white to solidfy the top.]
;W[mh];B[mi];W[cc]C[Very big, though a slide to D17 may have been better, since black might still be able to invade by building a wall after D17.]
;B[cd]C[...though if black insists on securing a mere twenty points on the side, white doesn't have much to worry about.]
;W[dc];B[lh];W[lg];B[kh]C[More small moves.  Black might get ten points here, but white secures much more at the top, which was at one point very thin.]
;W[kg];B[ne];W[me];B[mf]
(;W[lf]C[To much in a hurry to stop black. A play on M15 looks like it would have served the same purpose but avoided the fighting to come.


[yip\]
Yes; there's no need to rush and seal black in here.  Just falling back would work.  N16 may have been even better.]

[yip\]
Indeed, the ko fight in the lower left is much smaller.  Black has much better threats in the lower right corner; he may even be able to kill outright.]
;B[aq];W[hl];B[jl];W[ap];B[mf];W[ke]
(;B[aq];W[qr]C[Very big; I think the corner could very well have been killed otherwise.]
;B[ap];W[jh]C[Mabye a play at H10 would be better?



[yip\]
This is rather small; the black center here can't possibly be more than 8 points, even if black gets K12.  If white is looking to save the stones near J9, a lighter play around H11 would be better - though honestly, all white should need at this point is a play around F13.

B16 is much larger, and is sente for both sides.  White could also aim to attach around D11, to stir things up a bit.]
;B[hk]C[Black should capture on a larger scale with J10.];W[ki]
;B[ij]C[J10 would have accomplished the same thing in one move if played in the first place.]
;W[li]C[Really small; 4 points in gote.];B[hh]C[Much better; black makes the left side much more solid, and can extends further into white's territory at the top.

B17 is still large for black, though.]

[[yip\]
Both black and white missed some large plays in this game.  Oftentimes, each player seemed very focused on responding to the opponent's last move.  Black in particular was guilty of playing forcing moves for no good reason; these just forced white to connect and thereby strengthen his stones.

Just because an opponent lives during an invasion of a moyo doesn't mean the invasion is successful - the upper right was a very good example of this.  Black allowed himself to be surrounded for a small bit of territory, while white was able to solidify his positions which were previously very thin.

Finally, be willing to reevaluate the value of stones; sometimes, a capture can be very small compared with other plays, and isn't worth trying to prevent.]
