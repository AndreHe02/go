C[Hi,

the review will be done by KGS pupukani 1D from Finland

You said that you were unsatisfied with your skills in this game. So let's see what went wrong or what could have been better.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[od];W[qn]TR[qj]C[It's probably just a matter of style, whether you want to play here or at the triangle. 

Usually when you want to break down your opponents side, you would like to play in the middle, so that for black it's impossible to make the perfect extension.

For example here black could pincer. The pincer would do two things. See variation.]
(;B[oo]C[This lookd like Takemiya Masaki, but in a weird place. Usually you confuse this with the Suusaku's kosumi, which is from the 3-4 point, when the corner is not open.]
(;W[qk]C[Nothing wrong with this one];B[qh]C[Should be closer, black is the one attacking here, so he has no need to fear white on his own side.]
;W[dj];B[jp]LB[rp:a]C[White should play at A soon. It's big in points and also makes R6 stronger.]
(;W[jc]C[At this point white's opening is very good];B[oh]SQ[pg]
[pf][pe]C[This move is probably worth 3 points. But it puts pressure on white.]
;W[ok]C[S4 is also a good choice here. Black could play at S5 threatening white's eye shape, and at the same time securing the corner.]
;B[cn];W[co];B[dn];W[fp];B[hq];W[fn];B[bo];W[bp];B[bk]
(;W[bj]C[Touching makes both stronger, but white doesnt need to get stronger, so white should attack from a distance. check the variations]
(;B[el];W[ck];B[cl]C[White should play a little bit more around the black weak group to get sente moves.]
(;W[cd];B[gc]C[Added a variation.]
(;W[ge]C[I don't think this is bad, but white is having a problem. See variation]
(;B[ib];W[eb];B[kb];W[fj]C[this is also good];B[gl];W[hj];B[hm]
;W[ho];B[go];W[gp];B[gn]TR[ho]C[Some variations added
 triangle stone is important, because it is cutting black's group]
(;W[je];B[mc]LB[rp:a][hp:b][qq:c][cn:d][hq:e]C[A and B look like the biggest points now. Maybe even C now that white has played P9

A and C are big in points, but B is just important. D group is not 100% alive. In this kind of territorial game an attack like this would be decisive. B also hurts E stone]
;W[mh]LB[lg:a][mh:b]C[A is the weak point now, removing anything B stone created.]
;B[rp]C[Huge]
(;W[nq]TR[jp][hm][oo][pp]LB[pr:a][kq:b][lp:c][mp:d][mo:e]C[When choosing an invasion, keep in mid the future. With this white can play A or B next to make eyes, or C or D or E to get out. But to get out when Black has such strength outside is very hard.

This invasion is too deep. Better to just reduce safely.

The safest move would probably be at E];B[mp]C[You should touch immediately]

[ho:b][mq:c]C[Result: B+Resign

The biggest problems were the A sequence, and that you didnt save B stone, and also the invasion around C.

I hope you learned something. I tried to explain everything as well as i could.

Your problems were not so big, but just something you will see when you progress a little bit. 

And also black got so much because he tried everything, and some of the things he tried worked, like the A sequence.

If you have any questions or feedback, contact me in KGS (pupukani)]
