AB[pd][dp]C[Dear reviewer,

please review for White.
My problem with this game is, that it felt to me like all moves were right. So I do not see a big mistake. Probably I should have played tenuki several times? Or did I fight in the wrong places from the wrong direction? I really don't know. So please point out my mistakes and try to explain the reasons behind. Thank you very much!

Best regards,

;W[pn];B[nq];W[qj];B[qc]C[This move felt rather uncommon.

Az: Yeah. It's really solid, but very slow. It *does* make the corner very strong, so maybe it's ok for a handicap game?]
;W[cn];B[fp];W[dj];B[cc]C[Seemed to early. So my mood was quite good.

Az: Yup, black by black.];W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fc];B[fb]
;W[gc];B[bd];W[be];B[bc];W[cf];B[qh]
(;W[oj]C[Az: Too slow, this isn't really urgent yet and there are big places left to play.]
;B[oh];W[md]C[Preventing black from getting an extension on the top.

Az: The shape looks funny, but I don't see a better move up top and after P12 you need to prevent an extension.]
;B[kd]C[Az: Hook, line, and sinker]
(;W[mf];B[kf]
(;W[mh];B[ni]C[So far I had no trouble. This was the first move where I had to think a bit longer.

Az: The closer two groups are before a splitting attack, the more severe the attack. Thats why you don't want to help your opponent split you. This is not good for white.]
(;W[nj]C[I decided to push from this side, so Black would hurt himself.

Az: The problem is that it also hurts you... you can just as easily say you're hurting one side by helping the other. This also doesn't do much for the group below (already strong, not much profit), so why is this move so important?]
;B[mi];W[lh];B[jg];W[ki];B[mj]
(;W[nl];B[mc];W[nc];B[lc];W[nd];B[of]C[Az: Black is really hurting himself here.]
(;W[jc]C[Taking away the base.

Az: See comment on the variation.];B[id]
(;W[hb];B[ih]LB[jc:B][ij:A]C[Az: The fact that you can't play A is proof that you were not ready to attack when you played B.]
;W[jj];B[lk]
(;W[hj]C[Black is enclosed now.

Az: Yes but where is your advantage? Are you thickner? (No). Did you get profit? (No). Maybe you reduced a black territory or made one of his groups weak? (No, no).]
;B[ge]
(;W[ff]C[Az: This is 'ok'... but the shape is still off.];B[gf]
;W[fg];B[gh];W[fh];B[gi]C[In terms of territory I am still behind and I did not see a way to kill the black group. So I decided to turn somewhere else.

Az: Pushing from behind here just weakened the center, you only gained maybe 5-8 points compared to not pushing here. The attack was a failure because you took the base before the center was ready to fight.]
;W[hq]TR[nc][md][nd][mf][lh][mh][ki][hj][jj]C[Az: You have to play here, but its a little risky since the center is weak. The game is hard for white.]
;B[gq];W[hp];B[kq];W[hn]LB[cq:B][eq:A]C[I was thinking about playing A or B instead, but I thought that the actual move almost connects the two weak groups.

Az: Jumping is very proper... but its a question of what you *need*. If you weren't behind, play this move. Since you're losing you have to play in the corner.]

;B[le];W[ld];B[lf];W[kc]C[Az: This was very good, finally it looks like you're getting back in the game.]
;B[ic];W[ib];B[nb];W[ob];B[pb]
(;W[mb]LB[na:A]C[This is probably one of the loosing moves. Seems like I should play at A instead.

Az: Yup, you should really think about aji before doing stuff like this.]
