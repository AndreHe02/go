C[nk0911: Hi!

CZR: Hi, my name is CaeZaR on kgs.  If you have any questions, please send them to CaeZaR.kgs@usask.ca.  If you find this review helpful, please do not hesitate to ask for me by name for your next gtl review.

My review philosophy:

A good kyu review should not address every error in play; rather, it should focus on the major errors in the game, especially those errors that are repeated.  As a kyu player myself, I am incapable of finding every error anyway.

I try to restrict my comments to those that I am confident in.  Never-the-less, as my play is error prone, I may make reviewing mistakes (miss bad moves and rebuke decent/good moves) and for that I do apologize.]
;B[pd]C[creedfox: hello];W[pq];B[cp];W[dd];B[jc];W[gc]LB[hc:1]
[lc:2]TR[cj][dj][pn][qn][po][qo][eq]C[CZR: Despite that both moves are extensions from the 4-4 point, B get the better of this exchang in that his move creates a larger moyo than yours.  In the immediate context, I think 1 is preferable as the follow-up at 2 is then available.  That said, the opening calls for responding to local moves only when necessary and this is not the case here as it does not threaten any of your stones.  Your move should be elsewhere (some options marked).]

(;B[mc]TR[pj][qj][pn][qn][po][qo][ep][fp][eq][fq]C[CZR: Likewise, B plays too much in responce to your move (so the two cancel out I suppose).  His move indicates he feels threatened by your last move, when such is not the case.  B would do better to play at a marked position or something similar.

Even if W were to follow-up with an attack on the previous B stone, it is in no trouble.  See variations.]
;W[cg]TR[cj][dj]C[CZR: This move is better in that it is not simply a responce to B's previous move.  But it would be better placed farther away.]
;B[cc]LB[dc:A][cd:B]TR[gc][cg]C[CZR: This is a good move for B.  No matter W's response 'A' or 'B', he will be overconcentrated because he has both marked positions.]

(;W[dc];B[cd];W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[de];W[cf];B[db];W[eb];B[da]
LB[cb:A]C[CZR: Better to simply fix the cutting point with 'A'.]

(;W[ea]LB[gc:A]TR[ec]C[CZR: Likewise, B should not play this endgame move.  It is worth almost nothing.  Just protect your cutting point (marked) with one of the variations.

The unfortunate thing is that the cutting point needs an extra B stone to protect.  This additional move will make the stone at 'A' overconcentrated and virtually a non-play.]
;B[bb];W[ee];B[ec]C[at this point i ceate two seperate shicho. is there a way he could have prevented either one i wonder? and possibly take my group?

CZR: This attack is fruitless.];W[ed];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd]LB[ea:B]
[po:A]C[CZR: If B had a ladder breaker, say at 'A', this attack would have worked.  That is another reason why protecting your cutting point rather than playing 'B' would have been better.]
;W[fe];B[gd];W[hd];B[ge];W[gf]C[CZR: Bad for B :)];B[cm];W[qo]
;B[lq]
(;W[hq]LB[jq:A]C[CZR: This move lacks precision.  A play in this area is a fine strategy, but I don't think this play is the best technique.  I think a play at 'A' is better.  See variations.]
;B[jq];W[eq]C[at this point my bottom stones felt a little cramped. they survived in the end, but i feel i could have played it better.]
;B[dq];W[dr];B[ko]C[CZR: Strange.]
(;W[ip]TR[ko][jq][lq]C[CZR: What are you trying to accomplish with this move?  If it is to weaken B's marked group, it is ineffective.  On the other hand, it is not extending a moyo or making territory, so it is a bad move it would seem.  See variation for another line of thought.]
;B[km]C[CZR: What do you think of B's move here?  If you asked him what the point of this move is, what would he say?  I doesn't form a moyo with anything, doesn't attack any W stones and doesn't make any territory.  It's just a bad move.]
;W[qj]C[CZR: This is the right kind of thinking.  B should have played here, but is now too late.]
;B[cr];W[dp];B[cq];W[er];B[do];W[ep];B[en]C[CZR: Compare this result to the variation at 41.  B is contained better in the other variation and W has a larger moyo.]
;W[fn]C[CZR: This move asks B to strengthen his position and in exchange gives you very little.]
;B[em];W[ck]C[CZR: This is a better idea.  Extend from your strength above and keep B from making the same extension.]
;B[eo]C[CZR: Same comment as before: This move accomplishes nothing for B, but helps you strengthen your position.  This one is worse than a non-move and can be referred to as a "thank-you" move.

Remember: Just because a move is sente, doesn't make it a good move.]
;W[fo];B[dj];W[cj];B[dk];W[di];B[cl];W[bk]TR[qf][qg]C[CZR: This move is too small and should come later in the game.  Consider how much bigger the marked points are.]
;B[bl];W[al]C[CZR: Even smaller, and it is gote!];B[am];W[ak]
;B[ei];W[dh];B[eh]C[i think he intended on saving the one stone and realized that he couldn't.]
;W[eg];B[fm];W[gm]TR[qf][qg][qh]C[CZR: Apparently no one sees the marked area, which is worth more than any of these moves.]
;B[mo];W[oo];B[nq];W[oq];B[np];W[no];B[jp];W[io];B[mn];W[nn]
;B[me];W[qg]TR[ld][md][nd]SQ[rh][sh][ri][si][rj][sj]C[CZR: This is why you claim the side first: B's last move maybe helps him gain 3 points, where as this W move is good for much more.]
;B[pf];W[qf];B[nm]
(;W[om];B[nl];W[qc]C[i feel that this move may have been too agressive. what would you say?]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe];B[ol]
(;W[pl];B[pm];W[on];B[pk];W[ql];B[qk];W[rk]C[at this point i felt a little unsafe. hw as puuting a lot of preasure on me in the bottom right. was there a safer way to do this?

CZR: See variation at 95 for an alternative line.];B[ok];W[rj]
;B[op];W[pp];B[jf];W[he]TR[hb][qb][gh][oh][gl]C[CZR: Bigger moves exist (marked).]
;B[ae];W[af];B[bc];W[gh]C[CZR: Good point.];B[gj];W[ih];B[qb]

(;W[sc]C[CZR: Unnecessary (see variation).];B[pg];W[ph];B[qh]
;W[qi];B[oh];W[pi];B[oi];W[if];B[jg]C[CZR: That exchange helped B as much as it did W.]

;W[ji];B[ki];W[kh];B[kg];W[jl];B[kl];W[jm];B[ik];W[il];B[jn]
;W[in];B[jo]TR[hb][ir][or]C[CZR: Both players should watch out for moves like this: B defends 1 point in gote when there are still much bigger moves on the board (marked).]
;W[ij];B[kk];W[hl]TR[ib][je][ir][nr]C[CZR: Same mistake as B 151.  That was worth 1 point in gote.  Consider the marked plays for W, all worth more than 1 point.]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[nr];W[or];B[os]C[it felt like the game started to wind down a bit after this point.]
;W[ps];B[ns];W[qn]C[CZR: Considering you are ahead by a few points you can afford to make some virtual passes like this and W 120, but it isn't good practice.]
;B[ib];W[hb];B[jd];W[je];B[ke];W[ie];B[ic];W[hc];B[ig];W[hg]
;B[lg];W[fh];B[fi];W[dl]C[CZR: This sequence of moves could be interpreted as distasteful as it doesn't accomplish anything other than pestering your opponent.  However, if you thought you might have actually been able to capture something, disregard that statement.]
;B[el]C[in this net set of moves we were basicly trying to see if we could break each others lines. it, of course, did not work for either of us.]
;W[ek];B[dm];W[ej];B[dl];W[fl];B[fk];W[an]C[CZR: This move for instance, unless it is a ko threat, shouldn't be played.  Perhaps you were in byo-yomi and just needed a play to make before the clock ran out.  If that is the case, for your next review put a comment in when you entered byo-yomi for the reviewers benefit.]
