;B[qd]C[What about the opening moves?
vlkplk: It's hard to say something about opening moves, since it's quite 
complicated topic and the way of play depends lot on players taste and 
feeling, but I will try to. In this game, I don't think there were some big 
mistakes during opening.];W[dd];B[pq];W[oc]C[vlkplk: Black plays two komoku on right side and it seems he wants to get 
quick territorial gain and solid position. White hoshi and quick pincer 
shows his intention for more open and agressive play, attempting to get 
strength toward the center, while reducing black's potential territory on 
the right side. Being black, I would prefer to answer white's P17 with some 
tight moves and to get sente after it. Pls. refer to var. Of course there 
are number of other josekis, which I don't remember...]
(;B[cp];W[pf]C[vlkplk: White tries to push black in low position. I would definitely 
prefer to answer white's Q14, but tenuki as in actual game seems also 
interesting. Black's R16 is not dead yet and white would need one (or 
two?) more moves to capture it.]
(;B[qo];W[kq]C[vlkplk: Usually white plays at K3. I feel this is too close to black's 
lower right corner shimari and it allows black to pincer as far as 
J3.]
(;B[eq]C[vlkplk: Now, white has enough space for comfortable life on lower 
side.];W[ck];B[jc]C[Should white attack R16 now? If so, what's the best move 
to do so? Also, what about black K17?
vlkplk: I don't think its good for white to attack R16 now. To capture it 
would take many moves, so its better to leave and see how to take it later, 
more effectively. For example, now if white attacks K17, say with H17 or the 
like, black would be pushed toward white's forces in upper right, which in 
turn makes white toplay there, get strength and capture R16 during the 
process, while still attacking K17.This would be anyway more proper way for 
white to attack R16.]
(;W[cn];B[rf];W[lc];B[kd]C[What's the best move for 
white here, maybe tenuki, around D14 orO3 or G17 or can't white handle the 
fight in the upper right then?
vlkplk: White seems quite weak, so he shouldn't tenuki, I think. The worst 
think is if he gets separated there, so his actual move in the game seems 
appropriate.];W[ld];B[gc]
(;W[ec]C[Would white better have attacked blacks 
upper right stones first?
vlkplk: No, this was good move. It strengthten white's corner while 
attacking black's upper side group. Letting black enter this point would be 
bad.];B[od];W[pd]
(;B[pc];W[pe];B[pb];W[ob];B[rb];W[ke]C[Is this a bad move?
vlkplk: Not bad. It actually doesn't threaten black's life, but it pushes 
black and broaden white's potential territory in the 
center.];B[cf];W[bd];B[ci];W[ef]C[ vlkplk: White splits black here. From now, both black's groups are in 
serious danger. Usually, situation like this results in death of one of the 
groups.];B[ge];W[hd]C[Is there a better way to 
attack?];B[hc]
(;W[id];B[gd]C[Would J17 for black be better? If white cuts, 
black can also cut atM15?
vlkplk: Black can't live on the side, so he must escape toward the center. 
So to connect at G16 was right, I think. On the other hand, white could play 
at G16 instead of J16.I wouldn't fear of black's cutting at M15. White is 
very strong around there, so he can manage situation somehow after 
that.];W[ic]C[vlkplk: Now, generally speaking, going through like this is bad. It 
doesn't make any harm to black, while white's group looses one liberty, 
which could have been handy during some later capturing race. Actually, 
white must defend soon after J17/J18 exchange, so it's white's gote. So the 
result is actualy that white lost his sente.];B[ib]
(;W[jd]
(;B[gg]C[vlkplk: Black had to connect first at L17. Now white has no worry about 
J16 group, while after black connecting, white would probably have to defend 
J16 group.];W[eh];B[if];W[jb];B[hi]C[Can white kill the two black stones. 
What would be the vital point?
vlkplk: Again, it seems not effective to kill them directly. They seem 
already dead, but have option for escape. So vital point would be E10. Just 
don't let them escape and later MAYBE they will die.];W[dj]
C[vlkplk: Lets see, whether black's C11 stones can 
live...]
(;B[ha];W[nq];B[nd]C[Should white have prevented this earlier or 
does black get out because of bad play by white? White didn't notice the 
weak point at O18 before black played O16.]
(;W[mb]C[White preventing 
blackO18, but this doesn't put any pressure on blacks two stones....is there 
a better way?
vlkplk: Yes. Actually, white should give up two stones at P18 and better to 
connect his more valuable three stones Q16 with L15 group. Letting black go 
to center and weaken Q16group is painful result.];B[nf];W[ph]
;B[lf]C[vlkplk: I feel that black should push with one more jump at 
O12...];W[kf];B[lg];W[kg];B[lh];W[rg];B[be];W[rd];B[qe];W[re]
;B[qf];W[qg];B[qc]
(;W[sf];B[qa]C[Again, 
what's the vital point for attacking or killing black?
vlkplk: You have to choose first, whether to kill or to attack (and 
PROBABLY) kill. For killing, vital point is usually point which makes eye 
for the group, here, say, B13. For attacking, B10 is good, I think. Still 
that ko sequence starting with black's D15 (or with C16) remains 
here.];W[ch]
(;B[qj]C[White also wanted to play there somewhere. Should he 
have done so first.
vlkplk: Yes, big point. This shows ineffectivity of the process of capturing 
black's left side group. Black made white's previous move to be gote by 
making tenuki and taking some larger 
point...];W[pj];B[pk];W[oj];B[qi];W[nh];B[ki];W[ok]C[This is maybe a lame 
move, white wanted to cut at R9 and also B12would be much better?
vlkplk: It's not bad move. If black gets this point, he would have large 
territory on right side and lower right corner, while white still needs to 
makes live shape for his 
P10group.];B[og];W[pg];B[bh];W[cg];B[bg];W[ce]
(;B[le]C[Can white still kill 
with B10 and A15?White was worried about the cut so defended with P12, is 
this necessary or can the cut at R9 provide white enough defense. Maybe that 
would be a better move than P12,but white was worried about not having 
enough liberty's
vlkplk: Black had to continue his fight on left side. Blacks M15 doesn't 
give much sense. Maybe he wanted to prevent white's N15, but already white's 
group is out in center, so black can't get much by rescuing his two stones 
O16 and P16.]
(;W[oh]C[vlkplk: On the other hand, instead of this move, white could killB15 
group.]
(;B[hq]C[vlkplk: Black had to think first about his left group. Than about his weak 
point at Q8.these are more urgent. Sometimes defend is better then 
attack.];W[ir];B[hr];W[qq]C[Is this a good move or would R9 or R/Q7 be good? 
What would be blacks best responses in the next sequence?]
(;B[pl]C[vlkplk: This is probably best move.];W[qp];B[pp];W[ro]

(;B[qn];W[rn]
(;B[qr]C[vlkplk: I think it would be better for black to prevent white from going 
up the side. Here, in the corner there is not so many points and anything 
white would do there will harm white's lower side group. If black wants to 
play here, he must think about sente move. For ex. simply Q2 does the same 
job.];W[rr]C[vlkplk: Hane by black is good, but he must not connect after it. The 
purpose here is not to kill white, but to keep him separated. And sente is 
important.]
(;B[pr]C[vlkplk: Not necessary connection by black. He loses sente.]
;W[rl];B[qm]C[vlkplk: Black has built nice wall, but it is almost of no use, unless he 
will attack lower white group and get some territory in center. It goes 
without say, that even if white is weak, he cannot be 
killed.];W[rm];B[mi]C[White can cut At R9 or kill B12? What would be best?
vlkplk: Yes, to cut at R9 is the fastest way to manage whites group. Another 
way is to connect it with white's stones on lower side, which seems better 
for me. As to choose between killing B12 or saving P9, I would try to kill, 
because P9 seems not in urgent need for help.];W[mk]C[Is this a really dumb 
move?   vlklpk: I don't feel so, but still there isB15 group to 
attack.];B[no]C[Does white need to defend O3?
vlkplk: I think so. If white tenuki and black, say, L5, which is my favorite 
move in situations like this, white will live, of course, but black will 
make profit from attacking.];W[mo];B[nm];W[mm];B[rk];W[nl];B[om]
