(;B[qo]C[Contact plays are usually defensive moves.  They encourage both sides to make their stones strong.  Since white has played into black's area of influnce, the right side, black should hesitate before making white strong here.  

See variations for some alternates.];W[po];B[qp];W[pn];B[np]
;W[qj]C[White is nicely settled here.  Black's attachment at R6 encouraged white to build a living shap in black's influence.  In exchange, black secured a corner that was not highly very contested.   black loses out in potential unnecessarily.]
;B[jc]LB[jq:b][kq:a]C[Marco: I dont wanted white to get the extension point in front of my corner enclosure. I'm not sure if it would be better to extend to A or B here

Andrew:  Perhaps asking which of those does white want to play more is the better question.  K17 looks like a reasonable move for white too, where as K3 looks like black could even pincer it at G3.  White is less willing to play around L3 as black is strong there with O4 attached to a living corner.  

K17 however is far enough away from Q17 that wK17 is not so easily pincered by black.  So of the choices hwere, I think K17 is the better.  

You might even think about going further with both extensions.  E16 or F3 both look like good moves also.  Less conservative, and both are not given to securing territory.  However, both your corners are secure, so why not push the envelope a bit.]
;W[lq]C[Pincer?  I think this is a white over play.  black has a lot of room around a stone at K3 to make it live.  White is not so fortunate.]

(;B[cj]C[This feels out of step with where the action is.  Weak stones are a good indication of where you should play, and the only weak thing around is M3.  

Further, white didn;'t have a lot of potential here.  There are only two stones on this side of the board, so it will take many more stones to make some white territory here.  

E16 or K3 are more urgent for you because you expand existing potential with E16 and exploit existing strength with K3.  Black has 3 stones on the upper side, so has a much better chance to turn the upper side in to bigger territory with a move like E16 then white has to turn the left in to territory with D10 say.  Black has 4 stones invested in the bottom right, so exploiting their strength should also be a goal.]
;W[cm]C[C10 also encouraged white to play this, so a black approach near F3 is not so good anymore.  This makes the pincer at M3 less playable.]
;B[cg]C[Black does need this move now.];W[ed]C[Black encouraged white to make a move the black himself would have done very good to play.  Since C13 is needed, the trouble move is still C10.]

(;B[be]C[This is just too slow.  Black's extension is pretty solid as white does not have any really strong stones (ie thickness) nearby.  This is over cautious, and you lose a good opportunity to take a good chunk of the upper side with G17.

See variation];W[hc];B[je]C[Now it is white who is forcing.]
;W[iq]C[The pincer is taken away from black here.  Now white has a large stake in the lower left corner.  Thankfully the 3x3 point is still available.]
;B[qh]C[This is small since white is not weak at R10.  Further, the 3x3 invasion is worth a great deal more since it turned white territory into black territory.  

See variation for a point comparison]
(;W[oj];B[oh]C[It is black who ends up defening after the aggresive looking R12 move.  White is forcing again.]
;W[eq]C[Now the 3x3 is gone.  Now it is a contest of upper right vs lower left.  It is not a lost game, but it is balanced now.  This is bad news for black, as either white has rank advantage or komi advantage, so the game won't go in black's direction very easily.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[bq];W[dr];B[bo]
(;W[em]C[White would do better here to play solidly.  See variation.  White is generous to black here.]
;B[bm]C[Marco:  Looking at it again i'm not happy how the corner went, but not sure what might be better plays there.

Andrew:  Well the 3x3 invasion doesn't work there with E3.  White has one stone too many for black to make life.  after J3, black reallt needed to check to see if the 3x3 was a good move.  Here it looks like black was caught by surprise, and in desperation, tried the immpossible.]
;W[bd]C[wB8 sure seems like an interesting fight for white.  He has little to lose, while black has two groups there that could be negatively affected.  

White kindaly lets black off the hook though.]
(;B[ce]C[See variation for a better move to secure black's group.]
;W[pb]C[This is a little too late.];B[qc];W[ib];B[jb]
(;W[nr];B[nn]LB[pr:a]C[Marco:  Looks like a big blunder to me now to run and give up the corner, but i was afraid of white building a big moyo when playing at that point. Alternate i was thinking about A to secure the corner but with white building such a big moyo that equalizes my upper right corner i felt like i have nothing compared to the pretty big white corner in the upper left.


Andrew:  Since white can cut at P3, this is not so great.  Black can probably live with O6 even if it is cut off, so this is not bad.  White is giving black a chance here.  O2 seems too small.]
;W[om]C[I think this is overly cautious, though I have not read iot all out to see if white can live.  It seems unlikely he needs P7 to live, especially since black can be cut at P3.]
;B[ln];W[jn];B[gn]C[This is reckless if you recognize the cut at P3.  The coming fight around here could also interact with B8, and let white get the kill, or get a huge sente move out of it.  Black should be more cautious here with so much potential interactions.]
;W[gm];B[hm];W[ho]C[why not cut?];B[hl]C[Why not connect?];W[mj]
;B[lh];W[he];B[ff]C[not sure of black's aim here.  standard moves like s6 seem better.]
;W[fk];B[hj];W[fe];B[gf]C[Black gives up sente here, and I am not sure why.  If F9 were a black stone, then G14 would make sense.  As it is black wastes a move protecting the neutral area just below F14.]
;W[hf]C[Oh good, white gives up sente too.];B[ge]C[This is at least worth a point for black, and kinda sente.  There are bigger things to do though, so white might even be able to ignore, and make the attack on the lower right instead.  Black will certainly answer an attack on Q3]
;W[gd];B[ee];W[fd];B[de]C[Now black really loses sente, and the gains are nearly non-existant.  Black has not secured much territory at all.  Black needs another move before the E13 area can turn into points.]
;W[ri]C[A nice sente move.  White takes point while securing the R10 group.  White is preparing to attack Q3.]
;B[rh];W[rq];B[oq];W[ro]
(;B[ll]C[Black needn't run, as he can still live there.  See variations for some of the possibilities.]
;W[rp];B[kk];W[nh];B[ng];W[fi];B[gj]LB[gl:a]C[Marco:  Wanted to strengthen my connection with the weak black group here. Thought also about A but didnt want to end up cut off from the top with the big weak group in the lower right.

Andrew: This move doesn't gain black much.  It would be better unplayed as it solidifies white, and perhaps later playing at F10 and cutting would be possible.]
;W[fj];B[hn];W[go];B[jo]LB[ko:a]C[Marco:  Not sure what i thought here, probably nothing or even less ;-)  Would see it better at A or somewhere else now

Andrew: I think the aim is the small little bubble you might make with H8, M 8 etc, but it is hard to make that happen here.  A is likely better.]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jp]C[K5 is now a donation.  Though K7 is now a senteish move that builds a small center bubble for you.]
;B[dl]C[This is an over play.  B8 is needed befroe black can attack around here.]
;W[cn];B[bn];W[jm]C[Now K7 is gone now too :(]
(;B[mo]C[Think sente.  see variation];W[di]
(;B[dj]C[Just guard unless you have something nice.  Black really can't do much to G10 etc.  See variation

Now think back to G10, and how much looser white would be here if you hadn't played it.]

;W[cl];B[bk];W[mh];B[mg];W[ig];B[ji];W[oc]
(;B[od]C[Let white run up here.  you don't mind since you are so strong in that direction.  You do not want to give white more access to the sides.  See variaion]
;W[nc];B[mb];W[ch];B[bh];W[ci];B[bi]C[D10 lost you these two points.]
;W[dd]C[This is also a good point.  D16 has been sitting there the whole time, and it is very clearly sente for you.  At the very least it is worth one point, and you can almost guarantee that white will respond.  You can then do whatever other move you were thinking about.]

Overall, black is too passive in this game.  I would say you tended to go where white led you, especially in the end game.  Treat the move as a precious commodity, and try to give it up rarely.  Try to make sure that the moves you make do what you think they do, and try to find better moves that accomplish the same goal.  

If you have a good understanding of counting, a good thing to study for you might be the end game.  
If you don't know how to count, learn that first.  It is a simple skill, but it can really improve your game.

The 3x3 invasion at this point in the game changes what could be white's territory into black territory, the squares, so each squares counts double.  Further, each black stone takes away a white point.  Still further, every black stones was answered by a white stone in what was white's terriutory, so we can count each black stone as taking away 2 points from white.  This gives a total rough point value of 24.  More than double the value of R12.  

Any move that turn opponent territory into friendly territory are always worth considering and makes comparisons like this to see what you should play.]
