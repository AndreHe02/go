C[this game reviewed for the black side by adum 3D (adam@adum.com)

in general, black played well. the main things i'd think about are mid-game fighting and cuts, both cutting and being cut.]

(;B[he];W[gd];B[dj]C[My Question:Is this correct direction?
D15 stones seems weak,
but i thought allowing D10 point makes 2 Black groups
dangerous at once,so i moved like this.
I don't know the correct way

adum: i think your basic idea is good, to avoid letting white get a base here. however, the execution could be better done simply a move before. in other words, instead of playing H15, play D10 (or maybe C10 is better in this area) immediately. the reason is that the G16 - H15 exchange is good for white, if white can then push through.]

(;W[fg]C[everyone seems to ignore the key point of G15 for the next few moves. it's really big]

(;B[cg];W[ch];B[cf];W[dh]C[this exchange is great for white. black is helping to seal himself in. after you play G15, what has the exchange starting at C13 done for you?]

(;B[fk]C[this is saving the wrong stones! these two stones are not important. can you attack the white group they're touching if you save them? no. so don't spend a move to save them. if white cuts, you can sacrifice them. see variation]
;W[en]C[now white is golden. he's got tons of points on the side and your group is still very weak in the middle. your previous move did little to create eyeshape]
;B[kd];W[kc];B[hd];W[hc];B[jc];W[ic];B[lc];W[jb]C[good sequence for black]

(;B[le];W[lb]C[a shame to let white connect this stone... still, you are okay in this area]

C[good. you made white heavy and started a fight that will help you below]
;W[mh]
(;B[kh]C[this seems a bit like the wrong direction since you help white attack your weak black stones below. however, these stones have  an escape route at R6, so you are probably okay]

(;W[ko]C[this is a chicken move. white needs to play faster. black has managed to come back.]
;B[cq];W[in]C[okay, now what is L5 doing?

but this move is sente to kill the black middle group, so black needs to take care of it]
;B[gh]C[okay, sente];W[gg];B[ni]C[white may ignore this and go for the kill]

(;W[nh]C[My Question:Next,arround R10 seems big for Black,
but i thought H15 group was still weak,
so i moved N17.
Was it correct?

adum: it's very hard for white to attack this black group now. black has one eye on the edge guaranteed, as far as i can tell. you also can make something around L15 or run to the other group. i don't think you need to worry. however, N17 is probably sente, so it's okay to play it. if white ignores it for the R8 area, N18 is big. of course, the middle is still the key point now, meaning N8 is urgent]

(;W[mb];B[nd];W[ob];B[oc];W[nb]C[you've managed to get your connection in sente.]

;W[nl]C[I thought this black group in the center may be dead.
but it wasn't.
Is it a White's mistake?
If so,I should have moved R11 at any expence instead of
connection move N17

adum: well, after N8 and L7 i think you are okay in the center.]
