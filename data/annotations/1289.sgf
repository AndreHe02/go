C[I've been working on joseki as of late, and it seems to be hurting my game more than helping, and I'm trying not to rely too much on just playing the patterns, but still making sure they're appropriate.

Also, I don't understand why I lost this game.  I'm not very good at all at reading the score beforehand, and when we got near the end I thought I had won.  I was surprised to find out that I lost by 5.5.

I played black.  I'm 16k* on IGS.  My opponent was 15k* at the time.]

(;B[pc]C[vlkplk: I can't say this is bad  move, but considering that it is not joseki move and that it leads to white making wall watching his stone in the corner, I think you shouldn't play like this. You would simply answer white F3 or make pincer move at R14 or Q14 which is joseki.
You (and me as well) must be aware of something which looks like a joseki but, for some reason it's not. Anyway, on our level, there is not so much on working with joseki. Just to see balance, weakneses and strength on board is enough...]

(;B[ql]C[Should this stone be closer to the bottom or nearer the middle?  I wanted to press the lower right but not let him squeeze me too tightly to expand the upper middle side.
vlkplk: I agree that left side needs reduce, but in case when you are not sure where to play I think middle is best. See, how later closeness of yours stone makes white position on lower side very strong. If you've played further from corner, you don't give white so much chance to cover some weakness he has there.
Another way to "reduce" white potentionality of groving on right side is very useful move at O16, which is just at boarder of twoo potential area. It means, you enlarge yours moyo at same time as reduce oponnent's one.]
;W[qi];B[qo];W[qp];B[po];W[oo];B[on];W[no];B[ro];W[rp]C[This sequence was very satisfactory for white. Now, I think, O16 is still usefull.]
;B[qd]C[It seems, this cut was good from
you.];W[qe];B[rd];W[re];B[rc];W[nd];B[mc];W[cf]
(;B[fd]C[vlkplk: After this move, yours corner is still open as well as upper side is. And white is free to make extension on left side. Therefore, I would choose some pincer play instead of F16 or play F17 instead, which protects upper side and corner.
F16 expresses agresive attitude, but whites extension doesn't allow any atack...]
;W[ci]
(;B[eq]C[Should I have played around C9 instead?  It seems if I did that he would've cut underneath?
vlkplk: Yes, it is impossible to defend territory when opened on both sides. Anyway, to defend the corner was better as you did, I think. You can as well consider E2 instead of E3, which leaves more options to invade white area.]
;W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[vlkplk: As you have almost lost this corner and upper side is still open, I wouldn't answer white move B16 at all and better play C9 or try to take advantage on lover side.
Even J17 is possible instead.];W[cm];B[cn];W[dm]C[vlkplk: Now stop and watch the
board. You have secured one
corner, one is more or less
secured for you, one is divided
between you and yours oponnent.
White potential area in lower
side seems winning game for
white. White stones there are
higher than on left side, so I
think, better is to invade or
reduce lower side.Maybe better
is to play some reducing move
like L4, ignore whatever answer
white makes and use sente to
secure your's upper side.
Invasion is also possible, but
you must be prepared to white
invasion to upper side.]
(;B[ck]C[vlkplk: As you have seen later on, three point jump from two stones high wall is securely connected.]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[bk];B[dl];W[cl];B[ek];W[cj];B[em];W[en]C[vlkplk: As purpose of white's
move here is to disconnect yours
two groups, you can consider to
make use of bad shape of white
stones and play B6 .It threatens
to keep yours stones connected,
defending corner meanwhile.
You don't need to answer white's
 reply and go on to capture
whites cutting stone. But now,
yours corner is secure.]
(;B[fn];W[eo];B[fo];W[bn]
(;B[co]C[vlkplk: Haneh at B5 is safe I think so you should play it instead of C5. Now, you made something like an empty triangle, which is bad shape.]
;W[bo];B[bp];W[cq];B[cp];W[er];B[dq];W[dr];B[cr];W[fp];B[ep]
;W[fm]C[vlkplk: White is now using very
well aji of his two stones at
E5 and E6 as well as yours bad
shape.
You have always to be aware of
this, and capture oponnents  stones as soon as posible, if
they have some potentionality.];B[el];W[go];B[gn];W[ho]C[vlkplk: White could play further
instead of H5 to H6, which makes
 him more strong.
This is technique worth  remembering. But in this case,
white wants sente so he chooses
more moderate move.  You better had to answer this
move, so you see that again  white exploits aji of E5,E6.];B[gm]
;W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fi];W[fh];B[gi]C[This whole sequence seems okay for me, except that he's getting a large lower side, but I'm very strong in the middle.
vlkplk: On lower side, white has
succesfuly enclosed you and you
didn't gain enough in corner. As
 well, usefulness of black's
strength in center is
questionable. So I think this
sequence was very bad for
black !];W[gh]C[vlkplk: Now white has built some
 wall which influences your
upper side, so you could  consider defending there better
than invading lower side.];B[gr];W[fr];B[kq]C[Another option is to reduce
with some higher move here and
than to defend upper side.];W[jq];B[nq];W[oq];B[kp];W[lq];B[lp]

;W[kr]C[vlkplk: You see, that you didn't
need to answer this whites move
at all. As well, some moves  before you could think and  omit replying them.
Instead of answering  automaticaly oponnents moves,
think well what is more urgent.
All the time now, you've had
chance to defend upper side.]

is alive. Anyway, if not, you  have still way to escape...]

well safe way to defend this cut.];W[lb];B[mb];W[gb];B[fb];W[hb]

vlkplk: Yes, invasion to left has gone long time agou. You didn't need to connect the ko, just you could continue destroying white center points.
