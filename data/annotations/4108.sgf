RE[W+R]

C[MM:  Hi, I'm Mike Malveaux, "wegobad" on most go servers; 7k in the American Go Association.

When talking about large areas of the board, I've gotten into the habit of referring to the compass points -- for example, "the Northwest" or "the NW" is the upper left.  It feels less cumbersome.

Thanks for the chance to look over your game.  I hope my comments will help you get better at Go.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[pq];W[dc]C[i play this opening often, just like it, many valuable follow-ups. i don't see it played often though.  poor?, or just my taste?

MM: This opening is fine, as far as I can tell; but the opening is not my strong area.  If I win, it's usually with mid-game fighting.

I see this opening played sometimes.  The black stones are the start of the well-known "Chinese" openings; the whites are part of the "Shusaku fuseki" (though usually black has the 3-4 points in Shusaku's).]
;B[qo]C[MM:  Good, a play near R5 is vital after Q3.];W[cj]
C[MM:  This looks like an interesting variation on the Low Chinese fuseki.  Normally I think this stone would be at C11, but fuseki is not my strength so I'm not sure.]
;B[ep]C[MM:  Good, it's important to play a kakari like this.  E3 would also be possible, but I like the shape this E4 makes with the Southeast stones.]
;W[dn]C[MM:  I don't think this is bad; in fact, it looks like one of the joseki moves.  But here I'd kind of expect a pincer, perhaps at G3, to counter the strength of Black's Southeast shimari.]
;B[ip]C[MM:  Good area, perhaps too far from the E4 stone.  This makes G4 a tempting play for White.]
;W[qj];B[pl];W[qf];B[nc];W[of]C[MM:  Perhaps a bit daring.  You wouldn't like to see Black at Q13 now, I think.  Normally you'd play S16 for safety (and black usually would answer at R17 to keep most of the corner), and then come back for something like P14.]
;B[jd];W[hc]C[MM: This move seems too eager.  It leaves a big opening for Black between D17 and C10.  Also, H17 is one line too far from D17.  If Black attacks at F17, you probably can connect, but at the price of giving Black huge center-facing thickness.

So, the more orthodox G17 or D15 would probably be better.]
;B[de]C[MM:  Excellent choice by Black.];W[cd];B[fc]C[MM: This move, not so excellent.  It leaves a hole for White at E16.]
N[Actual game]
(;W[he]TR[ed]C[was'nt sure, being a newcomer, aggressive moves like F17 still bother me, figured one-point jump could'nt be bad.  better move?

MM: You have a 3-space gap between D17-H17.  On the 3rd line, those can be connected (if you're willing to sacrifice a stone at F16); but you can't blame black for trying to come in there.

Better moves?  I think H15 is fine.  F16 would be ok too, or K17; but the move that's almost screaming to be played is E16, because it's so easy to separate black there.  But then black may abandon the D15 stone to focus on capturing H17.  If so, that's ok; your left side will have become huge.  Here's the idea:  connect your stones; threaten to disconnect the opposing stones.  If the opponent is getting strong in one place, then almost by definition another place is unattended.  Find the opportunity in the unattended area, rather than fretting about what you may be losing in the first place.]
;B[hd]C[MM: This is unusual, but Black has stones nearby, so it kind of makes sense.]
;W[gd]C[MM: Good, J16 would be more difficult.];B[id]
(;W[fd]C[could have played G17, looks strong, but did not like B H15 or F16, this seemed to prevent it.  thoughts?

MM: G17 is natual for white.  Black's follow-up at G15 is to be expected (black at F16 would be great for white after G15, so Black shouldn't play that).  White has a good answer at F15 atari.  Black will capture the H15 stone eventually, but White can get a lot of use from it by threatening to rescue it from the outside.  White will have a huge northwest corner, and black will have captured a stone and gotten a bit of strength facing the no-man's-land of the center - obviously a good bargain for White.

And it's too much to expect that black would get nothing; the three stones at J16 are not weak, and go is a game of balance after all.  White gets something, black gets something.]
N[Actual game];B[gc];W[ec];B[ic];W[fb];B[hb];W[ee]C[should have followed up w/ G18 first

MM: I disagree.  Black is strong, you can't kill in the north; so it's not worthwhile to destroy the eye at H17.  If you play the G18 atari now, you threaten two stones.  Black should be happy to let you capture two stones while he takes a big point somewhere else, like D3.  He could even capture back one stone by playing G17... so the net effect would be, you played G18 and H17 to capture one stone.

One or two stones is totally not worth it this early in the game.  G18 would be proper early in the endgame.

Let's discuss the move you did choose, E15.  Too local.  You're worried about the aji (potential) in the D15 stone, and rightly so.  But this is a case of "think locally, act globally".  Something like E10 would help protect against D15, on a much larger scale.]
;B[df];W[ef];B[eg];W[cg]C[MM: What are you doing?  Don't peep when you can cut!  You force your opponent to make the move he needs and depserately wants to make!]
;B[dg];W[gf]TR[hg]C[MM:  Good shape, but too defensive.  How about something like H13 instead?]
;B[di];W[dj]C[MM:  Too greedy, I think.  You really want to kill those blacks around D13.  (I thought aggressive plays bothered you? ;-)  But you're ignoring the territory you could make on the West side with a simple play like C11.

The black stones have gotten strong, as a result of your peep at C13.  They don't have eyes, but they have lots of liberties and plenty of room to run; so you can't reasonably expect to kill them.  You *can* chase them for profit, and D10 is a good way to start that, except it may backfire when black tries to live with something like D12.  So probably D12 or D11 should be your first move, and moves like D8 and G12 can come next.]
;B[ci]C[MM: Good, Black should separate White's stones like this.]
;W[bi]C[MM: "Hane at the head of two stones" is often great advice.  But in this case, what's your answer for Black at B12?]
;B[ch]C[MM:  Not so good.  Why let White rescue the C13 stone (thereby destroying Black's base)?]
;W[cf]C[Maybe B12? , then E11 is a painful force?

MM: Yes, B12 would be better.  Black would most likely answer with E11, so you wouldn't get the chance to play it; but threatening it is often enough.]
;B[bh]C[MM:  Excellent play by black!  Disconnecting white's stones can only be good.  It looks like black's alive now on the West side, no matter how white answers.]
;W[bj];B[ff]C[thought B would play D15, F14 does not seem to make sense

MM: I agree.  D15 would guarantee life for black.  I suppose he was hoping to set a snapback at G15, but misread it (the snapback doesn't work because there's still a liberty at E16; and white can just play F13 anyway).  Or maybe it was a misclick.]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[gg];B[gh];W[ei]C[not sure why, denying eyspace was the reasoning i think. thoughts?

MM:  No good.  This forces black to play E12, which makes an eye at D12 (if you next play D15 to make D12 false, then black has a ladder with E10-F10-H11).  You have to break this habit of forcing the opponent to do what he wants to do anyway.  What's wrong with taking a big point like G4 or S16?  Or how about doing something in Black's huge Southeast moyo?]
;B[eh];W[ig];B[ej];W[ek];B[fi]C[MM:  This capture is a mistake -- better to extend to G10.]
;W[fj];B[gj];W[fk];B[hh];W[ld]C[MM:  I guess your'e hoping to reduce Black's area a bit, but this seems risky.  Black's already strong at J17 and Q16, with multiple ways to live (so you can't kill with just one move); so Black can probably ignore you... And how would you answer if Black played O15 or N15?

Remember, it's not just what you can do to the enemy.  It's also what the enemy can do to you.]
;B[lc];W[kd];B[kc];W[kg]C[sequence too passive? (M16, L16, L13)

MM: Not too passive, really; more like misguided.  What's your strategic purpose here?  You can't kill (black's too strong); you can't make territory (you're too thin); you're not saving any groups (they're already safe); you're not separating any groups (you forced them to connect); and you've given black a weak group to chase (the two at M16).  Basically, you just made black's game easier.

Instead of that sequence, look around the board and find the empty gaps.  Try to see something useful to do there.  (Like D3, G4, M3, S8...)]
;B[if];W[hg];B[ie]TR[jf]C[MM:  Here, Black would do better with a "bamboo joint" connection at K14 instead.]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[ki];B[ji];W[jh];B[ik];W[ce]C[been waiting to play this, figured black uncatchable now, running toward own stones, little i could exploit out of it's flight now.

MM:  I almost agree with your thinking.  Yes, black's uncatchable now; so why bother to save two measly stones?  (B14 looks like a better way to save them, by the way; this C15 lets Black safely make a monkey-jump as far as A15, which ruins a lot of the West side territory you want to claim.)]
N[Wrong saving small];B[hf];W[ge];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[lf];B[ne]
;W[mc]C[just looked right.  clever?  stupid? black will have to atari N16 no?

MM:  In some circumstances, it would be an excellent play.  Here, why on earth would you want black to atari at N16?  What does that gain for you?]
;B[md];W[me]C[reason for N17.  looking to keep sente.  pointless?

MM:  Not just pointless, but bad shape.  After black connects O16, the five stones around M15 are revealed to be basically an EMPTY TRIANGLE.  Repeat after me:  I will not make empty triangles.  I will not make empty triangles.  I will not make empty triangles.

Now that I understand you wanted to keep sente, let's see a better way to do it.  Sacrificing a stone like N17 is often a good way to do it, but here it just doesn't work.  Hmm, going back three moves... 81, black O15...  No easy way to seize sente in the northeast.  Probably best to just play O14, and wait for another chance at sente.  I can't really recommend tenuki, because the North side fighting is starting to affect the 3 around R14, and connecting them would be really good for white.]
;B[mb];W[nf]C[MM:  See, you ended up making the O14 connection anyway; and not in sente; and black has an atari at M13 because of the horrible EMPTY TRIANGLE at M15.  (The atari by itself doesn't do much; but it makes a heck of a ko threat, for example.)]
;B[oe];W[qd]C[figured 3,3 unreasonable, too deep.  thoughts?

MM:  When the 3-3 is unpalatable, consider the 4-2 or the 3-2.  S16 (the 4-2) provides white with a nice reduction of black's corner.  S17 (the 3-2) threatens to connect out to R14, or to live independently in the corner, so maybe is a more aggressive reduction.]

MM:  DON'T MAKE EMPTY TRIANGLES.];B[qe];W[re];B[pf];W[pg]C[MM:  Hm, the ko looks interesting.  But ultimately it only nets you a stone, so you're correct to avoid it here, even though you finish in gote (you'll have to cover the cut at S14).]
;B[pe];W[rg];B[rk]C[MM:  Nice!  Threatens damage to white's area (so it's sente), and makes black's border stronger, and black's territory a little bit bigger.]
;W[qk]C[figured, why not R9 before S10

;W[sj];B[rm];W[oj]C[thought about this move, could have done many things.  thought i'd bag some points, but led to B wall on line 9. big mistake? i think so.

MM:  It's a mistake, not because it caused the wall, but because it's small and there are bigger plays.

Now's a good time to assess the score.  Are you ahead enough to play conservatively and coast to victory?  Are you so far behind that you need to engineer a risky ko?  Without this information, it's hard to make useful strategic judgments.

By my rough count, you're now about 30 pts. behind.  You can look at the board and see where black's points are:  the huge expanse in the South and Southeast, where there are no white stones.  Obviously, you need to invade right now -- no time to protect safe stones with moves like P10!]
;B[nk];W[nj];B[mk];W[mj];B[lk]C[now the realization that the last few moves really helped B sunk in. what to do about B's huge moyo? can still invade around M3.  how to handle?

MM:  Well, you've made it tougher by cutting off one of your possible escape routes for the invader.  But there is still a lot of room; you should be able to make a small living group if you treat your stones lightly.]
;W[gp]C[MM:  That would've been a great play 20 or 30 moves ago; now I think Black will just let you have the E4 stone, and make strong walls in the H6-H3 area.  After that, good luck trying to live at N5 or L5!  (Those are the two spots that look to me like White has a chance).]
;B[go];W[fp];B[fo];W[eq];B[dp];W[dq];B[en];W[eo]C[MM:  Sometimes the throw-in is correct, but here you should just play D5.  It's simpler, gives you better shape, and gives you one point more.]

MM: Black reduced you, but it was inevitable.  D7 would've been better than C7.]

;B[hk];W[ho]C[thought i could exploit B group's liberty shortage here. will check out B's response.]
;B[hp]C[MM: Good, don't let White get away with such cheeky moves.  H5 only had 3 liberties to begin with.  And Black's not *that* short of liberties (C9 is still open, and G8 is easily connected).]
;W[hn]C[why not, makes problems for B. also was looking to create some help for upcoming invasion. how else might i help a the play around M4 to come?

MM:  I disagree.  If Black doesn't answer locally, and White gets to play G7, then maybe it makes problems.  But  since Black will answer, it just makes a juicy target for Black, and probably won't be much use in the M4 invasion.]
;B[gm];W[im];B[il];W[kp]C[i thought threat of capturing 2 B stones would help new group prosper.  should i have tried harder to actually catch them?]
;B[jo]C[MM:  Seems to solve the threat of J4 getting captured.]
;W[np]C[should extension be on third line? obviously looking for life, but did not want to be boxed in from above, allowing large moyo, looking for greatest reduction too.

MM:  Tough question.  This should probably be at K3, threat to connect out to the southeast; then come back with something like N3 or O3 to try to make eye shape.  Don't worry about being boxed in from above -- you'll be very lucky to live at all, surrounded by so much Black strength!]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[jp];B[ko];W[jr]C[just liked this move, make sense?

;W[nm]
(;B[kr]C[game depends now on group living, did not think it was under serious threat now.  was it?

MM:  Black blundered; White is dead.  It is an intriguing life-and-death problem, and I had a lot of fun figuring it out.  (I did misread it at first!  So I'm learning a lot from this game.)  If Black played H2 instead of this L2, your eyespace is basically the 7 points L1,2,3, M1,2,3, and N1.  It's just not enough; Black can reduce White to one eye.  I don't see a way for White to live; check the variations.  They are a vivid demonstration of the power of miai.

It looks like White could get a second eye at N6, but again the power of miai rescues Black.  If White tries N5, Black kills with O6.  If White playes O6 instead, Black kills (barely) with N5.  There are a bunch of variations demonstrating this, after White plays K3 in a few more moves.]

(;B[lq]C[MM:  Oh well, Black invited you to live.  Simply H2 is much more severe.]
;W[lr];B[js]C[MM: Another Black blunder.  White can cash in with H2.]
;W[hr];B[ns]C[MM: This is just wishful thinking.  Instead Black should play F3 to save the 3 stones around H4.]
;W[kq]C[MM: Makes sense; no reason to let Black get a ko with M1.]
;B[ms]
(;W[gq]C[helps, but what about J5? decided not to be greedy seeing as i did not know exactly how it would play out.  figured i'd eek out win if i just lived.  weak spirited? just sound logic?

MM:  Fear of misreading.  Reasonable if you're running low on time, and can't take the time to make sure you're reading it right.  Otherwise, relax your shoulders, take a deep breath, say to yourself "I can do it", and read it out.  The more you practice, the easier it becomes.]
;B[io];W[is];B[ls];W[ks];B[os];W[on]C[figured up by 10 points give or take (allowing for B's monkey- jump upper left)? seeems close though: is black's res. appropriate here?  B's moyo looked so impressive earlier.  did i get lucky to do so well, or just poor play by B, or was B's position still weak?

MM: I think Black resigned out of shock at seeing the formerly massive moyo reduced to rubble.  Probably Black did not actually estimate the score, because it looks to me like Black is still ahead by 4 or 5 before komi (assuming Black gets the monkey-jump, and can cut off P6 by playing at O6 threatening N7) -- allowing for 5.5 komi, it's way too close for me to call... the victor would be whoever best keeps sente through the endgame.

I see no major weaknesses in Black's positions, nor in White's.  There is some trickiness around B9 as the external liberties get filled, so White has to be careful with that group; otherwise it looks like straightforward endgame.

I would say that Black's blunders helped you get lucky.  Don't worry so much about all the misreading around the L3 groups; it was a tricky problem, and you'll get better as you play and study more.

Several lessons from this game:
- If you can cut, cut; don't peep if you can cut.  (Remember C13?)
- Don't force the opponent to make good moves, especially connections (unless you see that you gain more).
- Don't waste moves saving one or two stones early in the game, unless they serve a well-defined purpose like cutting apart some enemy groups  (remember how C15 set up the monkey-jump for black?).
- Every several moves, assess the whole board, especially the relative score, and adjust your strategy:  you were way late with your M4 invasion, alarm bells needed to be ringing for you much earlier.  (Also, see how Black resigned when there was still an excellent chance to win?  Certainly because he didn't have a good estimate of the score.)
- DON'T MAKE EMPTY TRIANGLES (remember the mess around M15?).
- Don't expect to kill; be happy to harass for profit.  (Remember how you tried to kill the stones around E12?)

That's a lot from one game, much more than I usually find.  I give the credit to you for asking so many good questions.  I feel you have good fighting spirit, and you will improve lots as you gain experience.  Thanks for the chance to review such an exciting game!  I hope my comments are useful and help you get stronger.

Black has F3 capturing two any time.  If White connects F3, then Black is safe with J5.  Black can connect underneath with K1, then White has no eyes.  So first White must cut with J1, K1, or L1.  J1 looks silly, K1 looks passive, but L1 threatens to make eyes, so let's look at it.]
