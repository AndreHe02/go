MR: Hi Matthew,
I made comments throughout the game starting with "MR:".
My feeling is that you tend to start fighting just because you see an opportunity for fight. Of course I do not want to say that you should not look for opportunities to start fighting. However, I would suggest that you check prior to this whether your own stones are stable enough for a fight. In the opening and early middle game, I suggest that you check whether there are other important points on the board - sometimes it is worse for your opponent that he/she has to connect than to be cut apart ...]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[dd];W[qp];B[do]C[is it better to approach the R4 stone instead?

MR: D5 is perfect, as it is an extension to D16 and an approach move to D3.]
;W[co];B[cn];W[cp];B[dn];W[fq];B[dj]C[MR: Standard opening so far.]
;W[cf]C[MR: Usually white would approach from the wider side with F17.]
;B[ch]
(;W[ef];B[fd];W[gf]
(;B[bd]C[i considered playing c16 instead, but preffered to have the option of connecting underneath if d10 came into trouble. i didn't want to let white get a base and reduce my corner, but would it have been better to simply extend again to h16?

MR: My style would have been to simply jump to H16. If white plays B16 himself, black can answer with C17 and white has still only one eye at the edge. If white jumps into the corner with C17 instead, black should separate the white groups and white will have a hard time making good use of both groups.]
;W[hd]C[MR: Good.];B[ge]C[MR: Looks like banging your head against a brick wall ;-)
Why do you want to cut the white stones apart? H16 has plenty of room for maneuvre on the upper edge, and the G14 stones are stronger with the extensin G13 after the cut than they were before.
Simply connecting with B14 is the logical continuation to B16.]
;W[he];B[hf];W[gg];B[if];W[fc];B[fe]C[this move probably doesn't work so well as i thought i read out.

MR: I agree. E17 is the only move.];W[ec]C[MR: Good.];B[ff]

(;W[hc]C[MR: White not necessarily needs to play the exchange that takes away his own liberties ...]
;B[gd];W[fb];B[ib]C[i think the exchange was better for black, despite the bad shape. however i think i may have been let off unpunished.

MR: Black also has quite a stupid shape. The white corner is rather big compared with the "normal joseki" shown earlier.]
;W[pj];B[ph]C[what is a better alternative to this?

MR: The move looks ok to me.];W[nc];B[lc]C[MR: Black should think of attacking white harder by robbing the base with Q17.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[pe];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[oc];W[qf];B[pf]
;W[qg];B[op]C[MR: Q13 would be the logical continuation to Q14 (in for a penny, in for a pound ...).]
;W[mq];B[pn]C[MR: ?
Maybe you should look up the standard josekis here ...
(usually starting with R3 or O5)];W[oq]C[MR: Good.];B[qi]C[should this have been at r12? i was aiming to cut off q10 then turn to try and made influence at the bottom, but i don't think my shape is enviable.

MR: You have strange shape at the bottom and you have the unfixed hole at Q13. This makes it difficult to choose a good strategy on the right side. R12 can directly be cut by Q13, P13, P12, so I don't think it would work.]
;W[ql]C[i had expected white r10.];B[qj];W[pk]C[MR: Too heavy. White Q10 is not important as a single stone. White should better play against the lower black group, e.g. P8.]
;B[pq];W[pp];B[qq];W[oo]C[MR: How about White S4? Black can anyway not catch the white P3-stone ...]
;B[np];W[nq];B[rp];W[mp];B[qo];W[no];B[ol]C[i wanted to pressure q9 immediatelly]
;W[rq];B[rr];W[ro];B[sq]
(;W[pm]C[i had planned white s6 then i would take q7. now if i don't capture but move at p6, white can push my group along painfully.

MR: White S6 looks normal to me. If you really plan to answer at Q7, the black group is heavier than the white group, white can simply jump out with O9.]
;B[rn];W[om];B[on];W[nm];B[nn];W[mn];B[mm]C[i still get to cut, but i didn't have high hopes of killing anymore. i decided to try anyway.]
;W[qm];B[qn];W[ml];B[lm];W[ll];B[kl];W[kk];B[jl];W[pg]C[i didn't see this coming.]
;B[og]C[although it wreaks my top area, perhaps i could have tried simply extending to p12 and pushing out.

MR: I don't think that it is a good idea to spoil your top area in view of the very unclear perspective with respect to killing the center group.]
;W[oh]
(;B[oi]C[MR: I don't think that black can win this fight.];W[nh]
;B[ni]C[if i move at q11, white turns down at o11, so i thought ill take it first and see if i can capture it first.

MR: Maybe it is better to try to *read* instead of just playing unreasonable moves and than see what happens.]

;W[mg];B[nl];W[mk];B[nk];W[lk];B[qk];W[pl];B[rl];W[ok];B[me]
;W[hl];B[hn];W[im];B[hp]C[i intended to destroy the potential territory on the bottom and treat m7 lightly.

MR: Good idea.The M7 stones were initially intended to kill the center group, and as this is not a goal anymore they can definitively be treated lightly.]
;W[jn];B[hk]C[MR: What is your goal with this move?
To me it looks like just strengthening white in directions you do not want to strengthen white ...]
;W[gk];B[gl];W[gm];B[fl];W[hm];B[ik];W[fo]C[but now my reducing stones have become deep invasion stones.

(;B[fm]C[MR: In view of the trouble ahead, it would have been better not to save every single stone in this area.]
;W[bl];B[bn];W[en]C[i was worried about d6 being captured, so i decided not to immediatelly try cutting e6 off.

MR: It is already quite difficult to find a good answer here.]
;B[dl];W[el];B[fk];W[ek];B[fj];W[ej];B[fi];W[dk]C[surelly there must have been a better way for black to handle this situation.]
;B[ck];W[cl];B[dm];W[cj];B[eo];W[di];B[dh];W[ig];B[hg];W[kg]
;B[hh];W[mf]C[i thought that unless i somehow recaptured e7, i wouldn't have enough to win.
it is impossible now though, so should i have abandoned d6 earlier and taken the remainder of the territorry?]

C[w + resign

afterwards, i noticed that enen once i play m13, white may still live with n17, whoweing that my capture was actually very shakey.

thank you for looking at this game.])
