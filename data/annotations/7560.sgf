C[Hi Radu!

I can tell that your moves have good intentions, but you just need to polish up a bit! I'll offer my best advice. Most of your mistakes are fairly basic, where more efficient moves available. With a little bit of thought I'm sure you'll grow much stronger very quickly.

Hi

I played black in this game with an apx equally powerful player.
The result of this game was that I resigned after apx 180 moves. But long before I was knowing that I don't have big chances to win without loosing any big group. I just noticed at one moment in time that the opp. has bigger territory than me.
So I suppose my mistakes are mostly about wrong directions or about wrong timing or missing the invasion moments rather than loosing tactical mistakes. Please point to me how I ended so badly behind.

Thx, Radu
p.s. And also, please evaluate my rank (maybe as related to European Rank  http://www.europeangodatabase.eu/EGD/ or any other system you might find suitable for you)]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[od];W[po];B[de]C[In this case pincering the Q5 stone would probably be a little better. If you pincer the Q5 stone, you make a natural extension with your enclosure in the top right corner. If white plays D15 or D16, you can always play K17 or L17 which will be a natural way to close off your high enclosure in the top right and also prevent white from making an effective extension in front of his shimari.]
;W[fd];B[dn]C[I preferred taking big points before starting fights.

Although this is playable, it is normally preferred not to create two weak stones spread so thinly unless you intend light play.]
;W[cl]C[A pincer is correct, although exactly which pincer to choose is debateable.]
;B[cj];W[el];B[ej];W[cn];B[fq]C[I was ready give up D6 stone.]
;W[eq];B[fp];W[jq];B[iq]C[Too passive? I was afraid being killed and leaving quarter of board to W.

Although it is a common guideline to strengthen your stones by attaching to enemy stones, it is better to play H3 when simply making an extension for a base. By attaching to white K3, white has the advantage because he can immediately remove a liberty of black's and force black into bad shape. If black played H3 instead, any white move attaching to the H3 stone would give black the option of reducing the white liberties first.]
;W[ip];B[hp];W[ir];B[hr];W[hq]C[It is better to just connect rather than play H2. When black plays G3, you can see that he is forced into bad shape.]
;B[gq];W[iq]
(;B[ho]C[Now I want just to survive

A better move would be G6. If white atari's the H5 stone, black can play F5 and connect all of his stones. He will basically have escaped. This move is a bit too slow, where other moves can achieve the same purpose with a greater efficiency.]
;W[in];B[er]C[This is played a bit premature. It is almost always better to escape during the early game than be trapped in if escape is possible. Instead of black E2, a move like black G7 would help black escape. Try to read or play out that black G7 basically helps black escape.]
;W[dr];B[ep];W[dq];B[do];W[co];B[dm];W[dl];B[fm]C[I decided: now I survive. Was it too late? Should I tenuki earlier or now?

If you think about the point value of this move in comparison to other moves on the board, you can see that you gain very little. A move one over to the right at G5 would give you better shape and push through the white thickness.]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[oq]C[The typical move is black P2 because it gives better shape. A move like white O2 threatens the black position.]
;W[mq];B[rr];W[rq];B[np];W[mp];B[no];W[pl];B[qj]C[Good extension. It is a good idea to extend in front of your enclosure.]
;W[qk];B[pj]C[White's R9 only solidified black's R10 stone and now your upper right side is even stronger and has better potential for territory.]
;W[mc];B[kc];W[me];B[hc]C[I am not behind yet.];W[ce];B[cf]
;W[cd];B[cg]C[The usual move would be D14 instead of C13, because later black may not be able to protect a cut at D14. Also, C13 does nothing to improve black's points. If white B14 later on, black still has to respond with B13, whether the intial black stone is at C13 or D14.]
;W[gc];B[hd];W[pc];B[qc]C[It is better for black to connect at Q16.]
;W[oc]C[Although white played the safe P16 instead of pushing at Q16, white could have gained an advantage by pushing at Q16 and cutting black. Either the corner or the cut group on the left will suffer.]
;B[pd]C[If black intends to connect the P16 stone to the R16 corner, a better move would be P15 instead. Any attempt to cut by white will fail, and black solidifies more territory.]
;W[nd];B[og];W[ff];B[mg]C[Though this move may be well-intentioned, it helps to think about what each move accomplishes. This neither reduces any potential white territory/moyo not increases black's territory. This actually promotes white to black a move at L15, attacking the top black group that you need to keep a watchful eye on.]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[kf];B[hf];W[fh];B[ok]C[I am trying to find more territory.

It is good that you are playing more aggressively when behind. Just a note though, your top black group has a weakness. White could play G15, forcing you to connect because he could potentially cut you by pushing at H15. Then, a move like white K12 may completely enclose you. A one space jump by black to H12 may help you escape but it is risky. If your goal is to gain more territory in this area than a more efficient move will aim a little farther. Black could be at N9. A move that is sente and worth more points is R18.]

;W[hk];B[gj]C[I am still confident: I can run in center.];W[gk]
;B[gi];W[gh];B[hh]C[Or even I can try capture.];W[hi];B[eg]
;W[fi]C[Now I only want to link outside];B[ef]C[If white plays F15 instead of F10 things could get dangerous.]
(;W[fj];B[fg];W[gg];B[fe];W[gf];B[ge];W[ie]C[It is better to connect. White doesn't have any direct way to harm your upper group anymore.]
;B[id];W[he];B[gd];W[ed];B[ee];W[gb]C[Am I now behind? W has maybe 60 points, I have 30 points.

Yes, you are behind, but it is not necessarily over yet if you play well for the rest of the game.]
;B[je];W[ld]C[Why?

White is afraid that he won't be able to make two eyes for his group so create an eye in gote. This move was not necessary, but white did have to be very careful about his upper group to make sure it lives.]
;B[if]C[There are bigger moves. This gets 4 points in gote.]
;W[bk];B[bj]C[W: still 60 points. Me: 45 points, but I think W went wrong few moves.]
;W[rj];B[ri];W[rk];B[nb]C[I was trying make territory while threatening to kill him.]
;W[ob]C[Good attempt. you struck at his vital point. If white answered at N17 instead of P17 however, your stone would have been trapped.]
;B[mb];W[lb];B[lc];W[nc];B[kb];W[ke];B[mf]C[Intead of black N14, imagine what would happen if black played R18 instead. Firstly, he would make a big move for lots of points. White would be forced to play another move to create two eyes or escape. Either way, you gain lots of points in sente.]
;W[nf];B[kd];W[kg];B[lh]C[This move is not very good shape because it has a shortage of liberties similar to empty triangles. A better move would be at M11.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[qb]C[Now he is alive];B[rb];W[pa];B[kj]C[But I evened the situation once again.]
;W[of];B[pg];W[pf];B[qf];W[si];B[rh];W[sh];B[rg]C[You can block directly at T13. White cannot atari at S13 or else you will eat his two stones.]
;W[ra];B[sb];W[on];B[nn];W[ln];B[mm];W[lm]C[I am back again?

It is difficult to recover at this point but not necessarily impossible because compared to professional or strong dan players, we make lots of mistakes in general.]
;B[ll];W[kl];B[kk];W[jl];B[bf]C[If this move is played, it is better to play B15 for most points. Although white responded this move is actually gote.]
;W[be];B[hn];W[ng];B[nh];W[nr];B[io];W[jo];B[jn]C[Kind of last chance suicidal attack... About to resign.]
;W[im];B[em]C[Unnecessary. If black is worried about having two eyes in the top area of the group, he can create one at the bottom by playing at G1. If white atari's at F2, black can descend. See that white cannot eat the stones any of the stones at the bottom if black plays G1.]

;W[om];B[dd];W[cb]C[Thx again.

Your moves are well intentioned, though not always very efficient. From what I saw in this game, to improve, I would suggest reviewing good shape. If you try to apply good shape I guarantee you will improve a lot, and quickly. I estimate your playing strength to be from 9k - 12k IGS, though this is a  rough estimate at best. I didn't mean for my comments to be harsh if they seemed like it, I just wanted to provide helpful commentary and help others improve. Best of luck with your go!
