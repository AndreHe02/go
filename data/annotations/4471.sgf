C[review requested by siegoman ( black )

thank you for reviewing this game.  I appreciate you taking the time.  I will spend many hours going over this game and the advice you give.

I have recently been studying tesuji ( for 3 weeks, 2 hours a day ) Get Strong at tesuji, and Davies tesuji book.  The book problems are becoming clear, however application in a game seems to escape me.

main points where help is requested:

- around move 45 or 47 I got the sense that the opening was over, and I wanted to stabalize by reducing.  I kept trying to form a plan, the next five moves were very slow for me.  spent a good 1 or 2 minutes on each of those.  but I felt I was grasping at sand or clouds, guessing.

> Could you please show points to reduce at and likely outcome.

> perhaps at 45 another strategy is better than reducing, what are some things you look for when getting a plan together?

- what goes through you mind when you try to reduce or invade? what are some options in this game?

- around move 64 I missed something and the tables started to turn on the left side, could you please help with some alternatives, and the long term goal of each one?

- 89 started a painful exchange, can you help with this move please?  maybe some advice on what danger signs to look for to not fall into this type of thing again.

- could you suggest mantras or mnemonics to focus on and repeat? "make two eyes" or "don't get cut" or "find the moyo" ... ?  and roughly when or what moves do you shift / change channels.

- in general, could you help me select two or three aspects of the game to focus on, and two or three that do not need attention right now.

[Rich\] - Hi there... I'll summarise the points at the end.]

;B[ci];W[nq];B[qn];W[jp];B[ed]C[[Rich\] - I can't really fault the fuseki. Personally, I'd play this lower. If he pincers you, you jump into the corner, if he extends you play K16, which complements Q16 nicely.

Either way C11 is nicely placed to cramp the corner.

No mnemonics or algorithms, just 'what might his response be?' and a little reading.]

(;B[qk]C[[Rich\] - Generally, with a contact play like this you almost always want to extend. Especially with the aji of R14. See var.]

(;B[lc]C[[Rich\] - You say that around here you feel the opening is over.

The end game is concerned with taking valuable points between stable groups, such as this move. However, first you want to attack his weak, unsettled groups, invade or reduce a moyo, make life tricky for your opponent. 

You don't have to kill big groups, but you can gain a lot by threatening to do so. 

White's upper corners are pretty stable. His lower side is not territory yet, if you can get strong nearby by attacking his side group (which has no eyes yet) you can invade that later. You're in a good position to make and use central power and influence.

See variation.];W[nb];B[ho]C[[Rich\] - this just makes white defend territory. H3 is the shape point to attack a very long knight's move connection. However, white's groups either side are quite stable and you run a big risk that an invasion will either get swallowed up, or damage you as white chases you out.]
;W[hp]
(;B[df]C[reviewed the game a couple of hours last night.  I felt this would have been better at C14

[Rich\] - Again, you've tenuki-ed from a contact play. White's not under imminent threat from this move, and the stone at H5 might have been better left unplayed - you've forced white to make fourth-line territory.]
;W[bb];B[nm];W[qj];B[rj];W[pk];B[ql];W[mg];B[oi]C[[Rich\] - Good move! Right on the spot white wants to play.]
;W[mj]
(;B[nk]C[[Rich\] - Since you peeped with 59, you can just cut at Q11 here. See var.]
;W[nh];B[pi];W[ck]
(;B[bi]C[[Rich\] - Extending upwards would be better here - white can't connect underneath, so must run outwards. A stone on the fourth line will help. See var.]
;W[ek];B[fn];W[gk];B[jj]C[[Rich\] - wrong direction. White can't connect up in one move here, but there's a danger of him connecting above and your two C11 stones are very weak. This stone is also not connected to any of your other groups.]
;W[dh];B[ei]C[[Rich\] - This isn't good - by playing here, you make his play into an unanswered peep! He's bound to push through. 

A solid extension would have been better here.];W[di];B[dj]

;W[en];B[eo];W[dn];B[cm];W[bh];B[hi]C[[Rich\] - Nice direction of play, but...]
;W[bk]C[[Rich\] - Ouch!];B[bl];W[bn];B[bj];W[ak];B[aj];W[an]

(;B[jn]C[[Rich\] - At this point, you have to capture his right side to have a chance of winning. You've built up influence at H11 and K10, you can squeeze his E8 group by sacrificing (since B8 is sente - see var.), so make his life miserable! :)

In any case, he has two vulnerable groups now - O12 and E8 - and you need to stop him linking the two if you can.]
;W[nj];B[ok];W[lk]
(;B[hn]C[[Rich\] - a separating move here would force him to choose between the two groups... see var.]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[jl];B[ko];W[hl];B[lq];W[lr];B[mr];W[kr];B[mq]
C[[Rich\] - Well done - taking the corner is very big for black, white should not have let this happen.]

C[[Rich\] - this was a wasted move. A play around H15 would be better, making territory and still threatening.]

Shusmacku [12k\]: I should have saved the q13 stones

[Rich\] - Interesting game! Your local skills are good; you kept him apart and yourself connected at the bottom, for example.

I think to improve you could best learn some higher-level strategy. The middlegame - most particularly attacking and defending weak groups, and how to use power and influence - is a very important area, between the large-scale of fuseki and the very local tesuji. Learning about building and using influence got me from 12kyu to about 10kyu almost overnight.

To judge weak groups, life-and-death is a useful skill, and worth practising - check out goproblems.com, there are many other sources online. It might have saved that left-hand group of yours ;) You can also read about the middle game in a great book, "Attack and Defense" by Ishida/Davies. It's one of the books that got me past a big stagnant patch :) 

Hope the review has helped - if you have any further questions, let me know.]

(;B[jl]
(;W[lm]C[[Rich\] - He can choose to save this group... or see var.]
;B[al];W[bk];B[gm]C[[Rich\] - this also defends the cut at F5!]
)
(;W[fo];B[lm]C[[Rich\] - or he can make life really hard for his other group.]
)))
(;B[al]C[[Rich\] - this is sente and gives you a couple of liberties with which to threaten the group above.]
;W[bk];B[gn]C[[Rich\] - protecting the cut at F5; white has to make sure he can get seven liberties to capture the side group.]
;W[hl];B[jl]C[[Rich\] - If you can get the side group, you can sacrifice the G6 stones and come out with a fairly realistic chance of winning; the scores would be roughly even.]
))
(;B[di];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[cj];W[ek];B[fi]C[[Rich\] - Now you co-ordinate with the group above as well as attacking the group below :)]

(;B[pi]
(;W[pj]C[[Rich\] - White can't save his stones... so he should play eslewhere. See continuation and variation.]
;B[oj];W[ol];B[ok];W[pl];B[nl])
(;W[nh]C[[Rich\] - this is good shape for white, but he still has no eyes yet.]
;B[ll]C[[Rich\] - Now you start to harass the group... once it is safe, you can attack the group below, using the influence you've gained above, or you can start to aim for a large central territory.]
)))
(;B[cf]))
(;B[oj]C[[Rich\] - A move like this makes life hard for the whole right side. White can't pull R7 out, and even if the group above does run into the centre, it has nowhere really to run to. And if it does escape, you'll have a lot of stones in the centre to either make a moyo there or to break up white's lower side.]
))
(;B[ph]C[[Rich\] - this damages the stones on both sides, removing some aji from R14 and making the 'group' below very weak indeed.]
