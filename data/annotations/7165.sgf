C[Hello,

This is a Turkish Go League match between Bertan Bilen(me) and Özgür Değirmenci.

Thank you for your review...];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[jd];B[jp];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rr]
;W[qm];B[nn]LB[ok:A][fq:B]C[reid: Black usually plays this stone somewhere around A to build up his top-right area.  On the bottom edge, black wants sente to play around B.  Black O6 seems too close to K4.  In the game, white gets to C before black can take B.

My first impression is black O6 is a mistake, but my teacher (Jiang Ming-Jiu 7P) says it's playable.]

(;W[rk]LB[om:A]C[However, white's next move should be at A. See the variation.]
;B[rl];W[ql];B[rj];W[pk];B[qj];W[rm]LB[oj:E][sk:B][nm:F][cn:D]
[dn:C][fq:A]C[reid: black could consider taking A now, but of course, the white R7 stones would feel safe knowing that black must take at B before he can attack this group.  On the other hand, white might feel he must answer A with C or D, in which case black could still return to B if he likes.   Noentheless, black B feels a bit small right now.

All these considerations could be removed if black plays E instead of O6.  White will probably respond to black E (probably with F) and then black gets to A first.]
;B[sk]C[Ming Jiu: this stone is huge.  Black is now very strong, and the white stones have only one eye.]
;W[hq]LB[ol:A]C[which one is first? or bigger? Q8 or H3?

reid: Q8 is not necessary.  Black cannot cut there (it's a ladder), so white doesn't need to defend.Black can peep, of course, but there doesn't seem to be anything that successfully encloses white, so white H3 is certainly the better move.

Ming Jiu: Since the white stones are alive, white A (P8) seems like a good idea.]
;B[iq]C[Ming-Jiu: this is a 'thank-you' move.  The exchange helps white more than black.]
;W[hp];B[cf]LB[cq:A]C[reid: White seems to have gotten the better out of the opening so far.

Ming Jiu: Black should play at A now, before white has a chance to lock up the lower left corner.]
;W[pj]LB[ch:B][nl:A]C[reid: I don't think white should make this exchange.  It's true that black Q10 would be sente, but it would help white to settle his group (with a response at A, for example).  As far as black territory is concerned, black Q10 is actually a less secure grasp of the S13 area than Q11 (and next, Q12).  This seems to be one of those situations where white is better off letting black play first.

It seems that one of the biggest reasons amateurs lose games is because we help our opponent.  If you can avoid all the exchanges that help your opponent more than they help you, you will see a significant improvement in your strength!

A pincer attack at B seems natural for white.  Who knows?  attacking this group could lead to a natural way for white to help the R7 stones.]
;B[pi];W[oi];B[ph]LB[oj:A]C[Ming Jiu: black is strong enough here to cut immediately at A (instead of Q12).]
;W[ch]LB[oj:A]C[reid: White gets the pincer first, thats good.  But now the S14 area is completely black's, and white has to worry about the cut at A.]
;B[dh];W[di];B[dg];W[ci]LB[be:B][bf:F][bg:G][bh:E][bi:C][cj:A]
[dj:D][cp:H]C[reid: white A is more common in this joseki.  And in this case, since the lower left corner is quite large, A does a better job of making it into real territory.

Ming-Jiu: White should take the corner now with B instead of answering at C11.  If black then cuts at C11, we have white A, black C, white D through black G.  Then when white finishes with H, the white stones are very effective in both the lower left and upper lefft corners.]
;B[fd];W[fc]LB[cc:D][cd:F][gd:E][hd:G][be:H][ee:A][fe:B][ge:C]
C[reid: I would prefer to split black right away with A.  White is stronger in this area than black, so he should attack, not defend!

Ming-Jiu: Yes, white should split, but the joseki sequence is B, black C, then white A.  Then we can expect black D, white E, black F white G.  It may look like black is getting away with the whole store, but whte has a nice move at H for later.]
;B[gc];W[ec];B[gd];W[bd]LB[dc:A][cd:B]C[Ming-Jiu: the cut at A will be a problem for white later, so white B is better than B16.]
;B[pb]C[reid: Does black have time to defend the corner?];W[ee]
C[reid: Ouch! This is very painful for black.];B[gg];W[ff];B[gf]
;W[fg];B[fh]C[Here i couldn't decide if i should cut the D13 group or protect the K16-O17 group.

In addition, how should i protect K16-O17 group?

reid: Well, "The best defense is a good offense"!  You are much better off if you can defend by attacking instead of defending by defending.  I would cut here in a heartbeat!  (If nothing else, it makes for exciting games!)

Here, the K16-O17 stones are weak, but on the other hand, white doesn't have much investment there.  He would be happy to trade one or the other for either the G16 or the C13 group.  Black should not be able to kill both K16 and O17 - they have too much room to move.]
;W[ld]LB[ma:C][na:B][jb:A]C[reid: We have already considered attack versus defense.  But now let's consider this defensive move on its own.  Black can still slide underneath to A and to B (or C), so white can't really make eye shape here even after M16.]
;B[fe];W[ef];B[ed];W[de];B[eg];W[gh]C[reid: Black gets a lot of sente moves (which probably feels good, although they don'e really accomplish anything).  But white gets the critical cut!]
;B[fi];W[hh];B[dc]C[reid: Perhaps black misread something here?]
;W[db];B[cc];W[cb];B[bc];W[bb];B[eb];W[fb];B[gb];W[ea];B[if]
;W[kg]LB[jg:B][hj:A][fk:C]C[reid: This is rather thin.  White might prefer to reinforce with A first, making miaia of B and C]
;B[kf];W[lf];B[ke];W[le];B[jg];W[kh];B[kd];W[kc];B[id];W[gj]
LB[gi:A][hi:B][hj:C]C[reid: When attacking, you would rather not leave weak points behind.  Later, black might push and cut with A, white B, black C.  White C is a stronger jump.]
;B[fj];W[dl];B[gk];W[hj];B[ek];W[dn]LB[ck:B][dk:A][cl:C][cm:D]
[cq:E][dq:F]C[What about H9 instead of D6?

reid: That might be a good idea - I'm glad you saw it (I was going to suggest it before I noticed your question).  You might sacrifice the C11 stones in exchange for getting first move against the J16 stones (now) and probably securing the lower left corner (later, after black A, white B, black C, white D - white should keep sente and eventually get E or F).  The nice part about H9 is that if black later plays K12, white will respond with L11 instead of the hane - much stronger.

In any case, D6 seems to end up in the wrong place.  Black later scoops out the corner with E.]
;B[hk];W[jh];B[ij];W[ig];B[jc];W[jf];B[je];W[hf];B[ie];W[kb]
;B[cq]C[is G17 group alive now?]
(;W[dq]C[reid: This seems to be the wrong direction for white.  See variation.]
;B[bp];W[cr];B[br];W[cp];B[bq];W[bo];B[dr];W[er];B[cs];W[ik]
LB[jo:A][kq:B]C[reid: This cut is slow.  Black is happy to sacrifixe this stone to get better shape for his group (which currently drifting, eyeless).

Now seems like a good time for a leaning attack.  There doesn't seem to be a good direct attack on the H9 stones, so instead, put some pressure on black's large M3 area: perhaps a move like A (which threatens B next).]

;B[hm];W[ib];B[ic];W[jb];B[he];W[es];B[ds];W[ln];B[km];W[lm]
;B[kl];W[in];B[kk];W[kn];B[lq];W[jj];B[jm];W[mj]C[reid: Yikes! white is very thin here!  Connecting at K6 seems like a must!  Don't worry about the R7 stones, black has a much larger worry as long as white is attacking the K7 stones.]
;B[jn]C[reid: Now white's attack collapses.

After this, white tries to defend territory, but black is too far ahead.

Black tried to attack too strongly, and white got a good counter-attack, but unfortunately, white couldn't make profit from the counter-attack - both black groups lived and white didn't get any compensation.  In a fighting game like this, there is no time for fear or second thoughts.  The game will be decided on the all-or-nothing outcome of the attack.  Press the attack fiercely to the very end!

Good luck, play strong!

(;W[cp]C[reid: This side is wider.  But white has an even more sinister goal: he would like to get some stone in place around F4 to help trap the G9 stones!]

LB[ar:G][fr:D][gr:C][ir:A][jr:B][es:E][fs:F]C[reid: Black still needs something (white A through G is a problem - black can't block at B), and the G5 stone should help attack the H9 group.]

[hq:B][lq:C][oq:D]C[reid: white now has two eyes.  Black gets to play A first.  This moyo looks very large, but since the Q7 group is already alive, white can invade (B or C, where C is looking to exploit the weakness at D) without fear of a double attack.]
