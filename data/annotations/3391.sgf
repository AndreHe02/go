AB[cg][gc]C[RickMott: Hello, this will be interesting, I've never reviewed 9x9 before. :)
Because there are fewer moves, it is possible for a not-too-strong player
like me to follow variations out much further.  

The only major mistake you made was not being careful enough to
ensure eye space.  There's no room to run out on a 9x9 board, so
it is critical to check all your groups every move for potential threats
if they don't already have two eyes.

Also, in several places you played more aggressively than was needed,
giving white the opportunity to start fights.  With two stones on such a
small board, the burden is on white to start fights.  You should aim to
stay connected and take solid territory.  If white doesn't kill a large
group, he has no chance to catch up.  When you are ahead, play to
simplify the game if possible.

All my comments will be
indicated by the fact
that they are below the 
dotted line.

The key to understanding
this game is figuring out
what White was up to.

The White strategy was to
gain power in the center 
and press down on both sides
on each of the black groups. This
strategy does not take
territory into account,
the idea being that territory
will come naturally from
pressing down on the opponent.

You can consider this the
9x9 version of "Cosmic Go"
of Takemyia Masaki.
In fact, this
is *exactly* how Takemyia
plays 9x9, see 
http://gobase.org/9x9/book4/

Of course, White hopes that
Black will find it hard to defend
and lose one or both of his
groups, but this strategy
can work almost as well
if Black only manages to 
find minimal life (this is exactly what is meant by the close
relation between
endgame and life and death).];W[ee]C[RickMott: This should be bad for White.  On a full-size board, the center point has the
effect of  breaking most ladders and making big moyos more difficult.  At 9x9,
moyos are not an issue, so you should take one of the other two 3-3 points.

--------------------------------------------
This is the most direct
way for White to implement
his power strategy. In even
games, Takemyia 
starts with the 4-4 point,
which is the analogue of
building influence with
san ren sei (start from one
side of the board). The point
is that the center point is
a little loose, so it may not
be as good for building power
directly. 

Taking a 3-3 point immediately
does not seem to be such a
good idea for white since it
does not have enough 
influence on the rest of
the board.];B[dd]C[RickMott: Playing so close gives white the opportunity to start a fight.  I might prefer the
3-3 point.  White will have a hard time making territory in the center, and you would hold
3 solid corners.

--------------------------------------------

Of course, almost no Black
move can be considered bad
in this position, one should
play a move consistent 
with a Black strategy for the 
rest of the game.

Since White is trying to press
down on Black groups, it seems
that the counter strategy should
be to make Black as solid as
possible without being too
passive (though this might
characterise any correct 
Black strategy in 9x9 except
for even games with
6.5 komi). 

This Black move leaves the
corner vulnerable to invasion,
so does not immediately
take care of this side of the
board (as Black may have
mistakenly thought). However,
it does match White's power,
so is an excellent move, if
Black is able to follow it up.];W[fc]C[
----------------------------------------------
White starts pressing down on
Black, the point of his strategy.];B[fd]C[RickMott: This is an aggressive move; you don't need to fight.  Just extend at G6 and let
White worry about how to find territory.

--------------------------------------------

This move is not very
solid, as it leaves Black cutting
points. Better is B G6.
White would continue with
his strategy by playing
F6 giving him a wall and
building power which he would
use to later attack the left side.

This type of strategy is
typical of go: Attack on one
side to build power and attack
more forcefully later on the
other side. It is called a
"leaning attack."

I believe that Black F6
is similar to the later
Black D5 in that it is an
automatic beginner response.
When you start playing go,
F6 just looks better than G6
in this situation.];W[ed]C[-----------------------------------------------
I think that most White players
(me included) would have
cross cut at G6 in order to
seek complications.

Instead, White is very patient
and follows his strategy.]
(;B[gd]C[RickMott: If your idea in playing F6 was to separate White, you should follow through
with the atari at E7.  See variation.

-------------------------------------------------

Cutting at E7 leads to complications
which are better avoided by
the weaker player and at least
some variations are clearly
better for White.
G6 is more solid and seems safer.];W[ec]C[
---------------------------------------
White has succeeded in
building a wall that is facing
a rather meagre Black
position on the left. His
strategy is working out.];B[de]C[
-------------------------------------

Black is correct in trying
to block off the left side
from the White forces.
However, this move is
too close to White's power
(there is a go proverb
which says "play away
from thickness"). The point
is that White stones are a 
powerful enemy, so you 
want to steer clear from
them to defend more 
carefully.

One such defensive move
would be Black C5 
instead. This move works
better with Black's C3 stone,
as will become clear later on.

D5 is a typical beginner move,
which is completely 
understandable, because it
certainly "looks" better, 
taking more territory for Black.
But, once you understand the
follow up moves, it becomes
clear that Black C5 will be
necessary sooner or later, so
D5 is just a wasted move
(playing on a neutral
point = dame in Japanese).];W[eg]C[
-------------------------------------------------

This move already shows why
Black  D5 was not as good as C5.
A later White move at D4
threatens to push and
separate with C4, whereas
this later C4 move would
be met with B4, if Black
C5 had been played instead.

However, the main White
threat here is to play on the
right side and remove
breathing space for the
3 Black stones on top.
Note that White is not
thinking of playing on the
right as taking territory,
but as a way to threaten Black!]
(;B[gg]C[RickMott: Better to extend at D7, making most of your opponent's stones useless.
See variation.

-------------------------------------------

Black sees that the bottom
right should be defended,
but this move is a little
far from his 3 stones on
top so does not do the
best job defensively.

A principle of defence is
to try to make a move that
comes closest to completely
securing your group.];W[df];B[cf]C[
-----------------------------------------

As noted before, this move
must be played because
of Black's inefficient D5 move.

If C5 had been played instead,
Black could have ignored this
move and defended with B4
if White pushed with C4.];W[cc]LB[eh:4][ce:2][cd:3][dc:1]C[1 (the actual move) is a bad one, I guess - the d7 group will be highly insecure.

2 and 3 are safer, but too peaceful  

RickMott: Peaceful is good when you're ahead.... :)  but 3 is bad because you
make an empty triangle.  2 is OK because it's sente; if white doesn't respond,
you can push at 1, then C8 and (if white tries to cut at D8) sacrifice one stone
with the E8 atari to cut off white's center group.  It will have  a hard time
finding two eyes.

Now I would choose 4

RickMott: Perhaps, but I would prefer not to start a fight near your G3 stone if
you're not certain who will end with sente.  How about B6 first?  See variation.

----------------------------------------

OK, you have to realise that
Black is now fighting for his
life on the left side, so making
absolutely sure that you are
alive should be your main
objective. 

White has a good attacking
move at B5, so maybe that's
a good area to play. 

General shape principles
suggest that Black should
play B6. This seems like
a good move ensuring life,
protecting the cutting point
and snapbacks (see rest
of game) and left side 
territory. White will later
continue with D2, limiting
Black's territory.]
(;B[dc]C[
------------------------------------------

This is not a good move.
Black will lose liberties
when White blocks. 

This move is a late endgame
move worth one point. Now
is the time to play bigger moves.

B6 seems like the best move
for Black.];W[db]C[
guest2627  NR : Starting observation.


--------------------------------------------

White threatens to capture
the 3 stones.];B[dg]C[RickMott: This is a "thank-you" move.  You force white to become very strong facing
your G3 corner stone, for very little gain.];W[ef]C[
-----------------------------------------------

Now, White has a powerful wall
facing the weak right Black
side. White's strategy is
continuing to succeed.];B[be]C[RickMott: I think this would be better at B6.  This gives white B6 in sente, threatening
snapback.

-------------------------------------------

In such a situation, B6
is the "vital point."
Whoever plays there first
will get the local advantage.

Note that B5 seems more
efficient than C5, but this
is false, since White can
force black to play C5.];W[bd]C[RickMott: Which he takes.

-----------------------------------------------

This is the "eye stealing tesuji."];B[fh];W[eh]C[RickMott: At first, I thought white should take the snapback at C5 immediately.  It also
threatens to capture B5 if you connect underneath at E2, giving white a very big corner. 
Then I realized that this white move is sente; if you don't respond, the monkey jump
to B2 kills black.];B[dh]
(;W[di]C[RickMott: The snapback at C5 is still bigger, but if he wants to hane this is
the wrong side for white.  He should play F1 instead.   See variation.

-----------------------------------------

White is using his "leaning
attack" strategy. By attacking
the left group this way he
will be able to play E1 which
will make a later attack on
the right side much 
stronger.];B[ci];W[ei]C[RickMott: Clearly a mistake; white should take the snapback.

---------------------------------------------
Not really since White is
still threatenting to almost
surely kill Black.];B[ce]C[------------------------------------------
This is a mistake. Black
must ensure life with B2.]
(;W[gf]C[RickMott: maybe B2 immediately for white?  See variation.

B2 almost surely kills the left
side (up to a ko
which Black cannot win)
so is better.]
