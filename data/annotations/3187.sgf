C[I am 11k and this was an even game i won against a solid 9k. It was a much better game than i usually play, i applied some new concepts i learned from studying Shusaku games etc.

I would like to receive some comments as to direction of play, parts of the game (opening, middle, yose), techniques (fighting, defending) and anything else you see

I put my own comments on moves, please comment on my comments :)]
;B[qd]C[Also, please estimate my true strength as i will be entering an tournament in spring and i don't think i am 11k player (stronger :)

I understand that you may be unable to estimate my rank accurately, but just try to expess your opinion about something like this

Opening - 6k
Middle game - 10k
Yose - 12k

schwa: This is way too hard a problem for me.  To me, anyone 9 stones or so weaker than me makes some quite sensible moves and some completely senseless moves.  Usually, it's the number of senseless moves per game that determines the rank more than anything else ... so watch for any points where I can't figure out what you were thinking!  But otherwise, rank estimation from just one game is much too hard for me.  I know I play games (at AGA 3d) that are 2 stones stronger or weaker than my rating; weaker players vary a lot more from game to game!]
;W[dc];B[oc];W[qj]C[Strange move by W, but who am i to judge

schwa: W didn't want to let you get the valuable area in front of the shimari.  But if W can get three corners, that's better than the side extension!  W should probaly play the lower right corner.]
;B[dq]C[Black should probably play the lower right corner, aiming to pincer the lone white stone.]
;W[pq]C[White R10 is looking a lot better now.]
(;B[qo]C[this move is not to allow W to get the corner

schwa: Remember, it's not all about jealousy!  It's ok to let the opponent get their fair share as long as you get yours.  Rather than approach where the opponent's stones are strong (2 against 1), enclose your own (C5) or approach C15 where it's a more even fight.]
;W[qm]TR[qj]C[W may have lost the corner, but it has good side

schwa: the point is that W gets to attack black, and black has no counterattack since R7 is backed up by R10.  Black should not have invaded so early!]
;B[oo]
(;W[nq]C[Now black's group doesn't have eyes, and W groups on both sides are strong.]
;B[mo]
(;W[lp]C[this is inviting attack i started with my next move

schwa: There's nothing wrong with this move for W.]
(;B[jq]TR[dq]C[B is hoping to make marked stones work OR attack W to undermine the base it has made

schwa: Black can't be attacking white, since black's group is still weak and white's group has some eye space.  So K3 is a big overplay for black.  White will be able to invade G3 area later and K3 will be another weak group.  For now W can continue the attack on R5.]

(;W[kq]TR[lp][nq][pq]C[I got what i wanted - W defended, and W shape is pretty strong, meanwhile B K3 looks lonely

W has a local advantage there

schwa: Yes, L3 is a mistake for white, should be M5 I would think.  Black can't really hope to cut and kill white anyway with the edge of the board so close.]
;B[gq]C[B needs to secure what he has first

schwa: Now K3 is a very weak stone, white K4 is a good move, or L6.  Black's three stones on the right are very weak!  G3 does nothing to defend the weak stones.

Whenever you are making a move in go, ask
(1) where am I weak?  
(2) where is he weak?
(3) where is the territory,
IN THAT ORDER.

So, above all else, every move you make at this point in the game MUST have some meaning about defending the R5 group in some way.]
;W[jp]C[good move by W, but it's small, so i ignored it. If W wants that stone so bad, he can have it

schwa; W is not so much killing this stone as he is threatening your whole R5 group, which now has no friends in the area to link up to.  W also gets some territory in the meantime.  Compare black K4!

In any case, you're right, you shouldn't try to save K3, but not so much because K3 is small as because K3 is just plain dead already.]

(;B[pl]C[the purpose is:

a) make B bigger
b) make W live small
c) reduce possibility of attack by W

schwa: Now this is a reasonable move, trying to make some access to the center and strength for your weak group.]

(;W[ql]LB[pm:A]C[This is exactly the responce that i wanted, but if W would respond at A, B would have some problems i think

schwa: for the reasons explained in the variation, I favor this simple white move.  White is ahead, B is the one with the weak group, so W does not need to take risks.]
;B[pm];W[pk]C[W gets great shape here and the B group still does not have two eyes.]
;B[qg]C[strong solid move by B

schwa: But B still has weak stones!  This is strong and solid, yes, but very slow.  There are much bigger moves on the board, defending your weak group, or even just approaching C15 is bigger.

Approaching W stones that are already strong&alive is not the best direction to play.]
;W[ok]LB[pn:A]TR[pl][pm]C[P9 is a forcing move, B must reply at A to save 2 marked stones. I did not see this

schwa: are those two stones really worth anything?  The point is that they help you get out into the center to save your group as a whole.  So N7 area is the big area.  W group is already alive so W capturing these two stones is only 4 points.]
;B[de]C[This is tough for W, no matter which way it turns it will make B stronger

Please suggest a better move for W

schwa: this is a reasonable move for B, indeed.  W wants to attack your weak group still, though.  I would play R4 at this point.]

(;W[fd]C[i think this was a mistake by my opponent

schwa: This move is fine. W doesn't want to let you get a big upper side coming from your strong corner.

W can also play C15 or pincer D12 or many other choices.  But in this position, the big deal is the weak group in the bottom right!]
;B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[eb];B[cg]TR[cc][cd][de]C[W's shape is not perfect either, because of F16 stone

schwa: This is a joseki, so W shape must be OK!  The pros play this sequence sometimes.  B C13 is a little overconcentrated, probably better at C12 or C11.]
;W[co]C[This is big for W, but not as big as attacking the weak group.  Upper side around K17 is also quite big for white, building from F16 stone.  I might play C8 instead of C5, so that I can build either way.  In this position black C7 looks kinda severe, but W has the strong stone at K4 to help.]

(;B[cl]TR[cg]C[With C8 i was hoping to provide additional support between 2 marked stones and (depending on W's reply) support the corner.

Overall while the thinking may be ok, i now think C8 was a big mistake, see var with my toughts

schwa: I think C8 is the right idea (see comments in variation)]
;W[bq]
(;B[jc]C[I chose to ignore B3 for now, as i felt that K17 move is much bigger and additional var shows is not tolerable for B

schwa: White has a weak group!

Remember, (1) where is my weak group, (2), where is his weak group, and ONLY AFTER THAT, (3) where is big territory.

W upper left group is still strong (B18 makes it live, or H17, so if B plays one, W plays the other).  W lower left group is weak!  B lower right group is weak!  Both players need to focus on this.]
;W[ld]C[W is too concerned with B territory here.  W should attack B weak group!  W should defend weak group!  M16 is small by comparison.]

(;B[gc]C[i think this was a good choice not protecting at M17 that leaves N17 cuttable

schwa: now B group on upper side may become weak.];W[fc]C[now W is strong, and W M17 will be severe, so B must do something.]
;B[je]TR[ld]C[With this move i launched my attack against marked stone

I think in this position B was a clear leader in the game

schwa: as W runs out with M16, and B runs out, W will kill B weak group in bottom right.  W is definitely leading.]

(;W[kd]C[bad move by W - why make me solidify

schwa: I agree, but if W makes a big jump next and aims at lower right group, still good for W.]
;B[jd]
(;W[lf];B[me]C[My plan i started with this move worked.  see next moves to see how it worked out]
;W[kf]C[N15 is the same kind of bad move you just criticized L16 for being!  You have helped W solidify and your stones are still not in great shape yet.]
;B[md]TR[oc][qd][me][qg]C[to create such structure of 5 stones was my goal. I can continue pushing W 4 stones later

schwa: N16 is a very small move, thinking of this structure.  At most it gains the ten or so points in the center.  N16 aims at playing M18 to link up later, so it's good for that purpose.  But if you're thinking of it as "I'm making the top right corner area big", it's a bad move.

Black should defend the lower right group.];W[lb]C[
W stops B from linking up here, aims at attacking K17 group later, good move.]
;B[gd]
(;W[bb]
(;B[mf]TR[oc][md][qd][me][qg]SQ[lb][kd][ld][kf][lf]C[Comparing B vs W i thought that my overall strategy should be tailored towards attacking center ASAP to insue my future lead

schwa: yes, attacking these 5 W stones (in a way that aims at helping the N5 group) should be black's main strategy.  Though attacking W weak C5 stone also good.]
;W[jf]C[Was N14 worth K14?

schwa: N14 was the wrong direction.  YOu want to play at M9 area to help the black group below while attacking W.  N14 gains ... what?  How does it help B?  If you attack white but don't gain anything while attacking, then it's useless.  W is not going to die here with strong stones at P9 and K4 to aim toward.]
;B[cj]LB[gf:B][if:A]C[Here i felt that C10 was a must, before A or B

schwa: if your stones can be enclosed with one move, then you MUST get them out: don't be surrounded!

If W plays at B (G14) next, can black get out?]
(;W[eo]C[this is an OK move for W, defending the weak group.]
;B[jj]C[Again, i played this move as an big move. I think that this was a prime of B in this game

schwa: W has plenty of good answers.  G14, attacking at the top, or M10, linking up in this area and threatening N5.  I rather like M10 next.]

(;W[pn]C[This move is TINY!  W should attack from the outside on a big scale, not take two stones for a group that's already alive anyway.]
;B[po];W[on];B[nn]C[O6 is a HUGE help to black's shape.  W should not have played like this.]
;W[nm];B[mm]TR[nn][mo][oo][po][qo]C[While W got the 2 stones, B position did not suffer much (i don't think)

schwa: this is the sequence where W loses the game.  B weak group becomes strong, and W only gains 6 points or so!?  These exchanges were awful for white.  Until this point, I would have preferred to be W.  Now I think B has a won game.]
;W[nl]C[And W spends one MORE move!?  B is way ahead now.];B[mh]
TR[lb][kd][ld][jf][kf][lf]C[With this move i started my attack on marked W group

schwa: now B is strong everywhere, W still weak groups, AND black has more territory.  Game should be over.]
;W[hf]C[he saw it :(

schwa: BOTH players in this game need to pay a LOT more attention to weak groups!!!  W should have played M10, not tiny little Q6 sequence.  Then W would have a won game instead of black.]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[fe]TR[gc][jc][gd][jd][ge][je]C[This move was made to avoid future complications to make my marked group alive

schwa: absolutely.  Now that this group connects up to the left, B has no worries.  meanwhile W has weak groups.  and B has more territory.  B should win by 40 points at this stage.]
;W[ii]
(;B[dn]TR[co][eo]SQ[ii][jj]C[This move it typical of my play - the goal here was to weaken marked W stones and the strengthen by center group.

I don't think it is a good move, please provide some input there

schwa: this is fine, it helps prevent these weak white stones from getting eye shape.  It doesn't help your center group much, but if you follow it up with an attack at C2, W will have trouble handling these stones.

On the other hand, when you have that shoulder-hit shape, it's almost always good to push at least once, so a move at J10 seems like a good idea to me (see variation from last move)]
;W[do]TR[dq][gq]C[by inducing W to make this move, i achieved the opposite of what i wanted  - now my marked group looks very very weak and over extended

schwa: but if you play C2, W stones are still in more trouble than yours!]
;B[eq]C[so i solidified

schwa: This is very slow move.  W C2, then W group gets life and your stones here are still weak.  So you have to play C2.]
;W[en]C[and lost a chance to strengthen my center group

schwa: you were right to see that the bottom was more important.  But which center group needs strengthening?  It's going to live.]
;B[hn]C[i don't think this particular move was good, in the right direction perhaps, but not the best

schwa: if your idea is attacking white E6 group, this is OK (but still C2 better!).  IF your idea is helkping N7 connect out to K10, better to move around K7 or so.]

schwa: No, attacking W J11 group is bigger.];W[ej];B[nf]C[suddenly i noticed it

schwa: Both groups are alive, so O14 is only maybe 17 gote points.  Believe it or not, C2 is bigger!  It is almost as many points PLUS makes W corner group alive PLUS threatens to attack B D3 group later.  O14 is for endgame, after all groups are definitely alive.]

schwa: Sure, but L17 is the wrong way to start.  Which direction is big?  At least play L18 instead to get some edge territory.

schwa: right, so the big direction would have been to start by separating white here.  Now W can play M12 later and gain a few points.  At least if you had played L18 instead of L17 you would get a few points at the top edge.  Always attack in a way to gain points!]

(;B[na]C[This is my standard fighting technique. I did not see it anyehere,- came up by myself - please tell me if there is a better way
