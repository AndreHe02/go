[pk];W[cf];B[ce];W[df];B[cj];W[fd];B[ec];W[fc];B[ed]L[ee][cc]C[This is the first  move I now think to have been a definite mistake.  You've made an empty  triangle.
I would say you have two good choices: play at 'a' or play tenuki  (elsewhere).  You could also argue for playing at 'b'.]
;W[ee];B[de]C[Now  you have two empty triangles,and a rather ugly shape.]
;W[cc]C[This makes it  look like white has played the eyestealing tesuji, even though this is the  last play rather than the second to last.  This is good for white, bad for  black.]

 plisken ???*: this is a very interesting corner.
 fess 27k*: I think i blew it though.
 plisken ???*: I'm thinking I've blown it.  We'll see i guess :)];W[bg]
;B[be];W[ch]L[ad]C[At this point, you need to think about making a pair of  eyes.  You don't have a good chance to kill either outside group unless your  opponent makes a mistake.

A seki is not a terrible think for you in this situation, at least compared  to losing the entire corner.

In any case, making an eye and preventing your opponent from making an eye is  key in this situation, even if as in this case a second eye would be  difficult to get.

I think the key point is 'a'.]
(;B[ef]C[This move is not a bad move, because  it keeps white from playing at 'a' and protecting both his cutting points  with a single move.  But it shouldn't be played out into an immediate attempt  to capture; see the next variation for another way.]
;W[fe]
(;B[dg];W[cg];B[dh]L[eh][eg]C[This move leaves too great a weakness behind.  You could try  'a' or 'b' instead, although this isn't a good fight to have started at this  time.]
;W[di];B[eg]C[Again, you've created an empty triangle.  Your previous  move set your opponent up to force that triangle.]

;W[dl]L[dn]C[I think the best response to this move  is to give up your two stones, which are hard to save, and make a move like  'a' which just threatens to use them.

This builds toward a large territory where your stones can make a bigger  impact.]

If you don't have an eye and your opponent does, in a  shortage of liberties fight, you need a lot of extra liberties, because you  have to use up a shared liberty to capture the opponent with the eye, and the  opponent can just fill your outside liberties.]
