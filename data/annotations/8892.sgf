C[Hello, I am white in this game (Oceandrop 8k on KGS), it was a very calm game, I would love too hear most about the mistakes in the opening or/and about fundamental mistakes, I will add some comments on my own with questions.

I added this game for review, because I never had such a calm game, so I am afraid that it will be a bit boring for you to review, but I don't know exactly what I could have done better, so I would be very happy if you could take a look at the game and point things out for me, so I can work on my weaknesses.

The game ended with black winning by 2.5 points.


Hi There! I'll be reviewing your game, I'm ithmatic on KGS.

As for a boring game, I think "boring" games are sometimes the most beautiful ones. Anyways I'll do my best!]

;B[nq];W[qj];B[fd];W[qg]TR[id][df]C[Already a mistake? I thought it would be a quite good point to just ignore blacks approach and play at this big point?

 But maybe not so good at the end because no nice follow-up move and doesn't achieve anything beside taking territory and prevent black R12?


Yeah, I agree that this is your first major mistake. The approach to the corner (F16) is a big move, and you should be responding to it. Your move (R13) does not put pressure on black to respond, and he can easily tenuki. Something like D14 or a pincer at J16 I like better.]
;B[eb]C[This move was new for me, how to answer such deep moves? I played at C14, with the thought of making miai of C11 and D18, so if he goes further into the corner just extend to D18 from C11, I hope this was the right approach



Black's move is way too low. You played the right direction, but I would have played at D14 instead. C14 is the type of move you play when trying to secure territory, however, black can jump into the top left corner, so C14 doesnt secure much territory. D14 keeps you higher so you have more options later, and also helps support if you decide to invade in the J16 area.]

(;W[iq]C[In this stage I was a bit hopeless what to play, maybe better at M3? Or F3?

F3 is good, and J3 is not too bad, but M3 is suicide. M3 would be like trying to shoot down a jet plane with a nerf gun.]
;B[cn];W[cp];B[ck];W[fq]C[Instead of F3 maybe better to play at C11 to pressure blacks group? or at M3?

Yes, I would play in the C11 area, because your C14 group is very weak right now.]
;B[ch];W[db];B[ec];W[dc];B[lc];W[lq]LB[of:A]C[Black can ignore this because his O3 group is so strong.
This move was good because it extended your territory, but try to play more multi-purpose moves when possible. For example, the area around A is very important for BOTH players. Whoever plays in that area first will not only build their own framework, but squash the opponent's.]
;B[dn];W[no];B[jj]LB[ef:1]C[This move was very good from black I think? So maybe instead of O5, or M3 take tengen myself?



Yes, a good move for black. Tengen would have been a better option than O5 I think. Anyways, at this poin your D16 group is in danger of being closed in, so I would try to jump out somewhere.]
;W[nj]LB[kg:A]C[I didn't now what to do, maybe instead of O10 extending my potential territory, play at or attatch directly @ Tengen?


This is a passive move. I'm not sure what you mean by extending your potential territory, but I would look to try to decrease your opponent's framework a bit more, perhaps in the "A" area.]
;B[pf]C[This was a critical point for both sides.];W[pg];B[of]
;W[nh];B[hj];W[ig]C[I was a bit lost, maybe this was overplay so deep?]
;B[je]C[Maybe better for black too just play at F6 and threat too create more potential territory?


Yeah this is really submissive for black. It doesnt put enough pressure on the white stone.]
;W[lg];B[gh];W[fn]C[I would play here as black, so I thought good point for me (white) to play here? But I was a bit afraid of black E5.

Yes, exactly, it's a good point for both sides, so it's important.]

[rs][ss]C[I would recommend you study some endgame concepts. 
I personally liked this book:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?TheEndgameTheBook


Or, you could just study up at:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?Endgame


Either way, you'll improve your endgame (which would have won you this game easily), but it will also help you to decide which moves are big earlier in the game too.

Make sure you understand the value difference of gote / sente / double sente moves.

My other piece of advice is try to play more multi-purpose moves when possible (sometimes you just have to defend, or whatever, though).

I hope that helps, good luck!])
