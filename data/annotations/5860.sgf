C[Dear reviewer. My name is Alfa (17k) player. This game was against 17k+ player, so the komi is 0.5 and I play as black here.

I think my game was very passive and overconcentrated in centre area and made my opponent's left and top side was very wide and strong.

In the end I lost 20.5 points. This is wat I must pay for overconcentrating. But that was a good lesson ^^

Please your help];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[fq];W[hp]C[Actually, I didn't know the joseki of this move. But now I kow. Hehe ^^

If white played H3 i would know a few josekis but this one i've never seen. 

....intresing, must ask at the club next time i get there...]
;B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[fp]C[Way to solid and white gets off with both building a strong left side and in worst case H4 as a living group and putting Black under presure. Lucky for Black, White doesn't realease how strong he actually can get.]

(;W[fo];B[hq];W[ep];B[jq]C[Is this quite ok? since this isn't joseki

Playeble but not good, white at D8 or D10 makes Black uphill so much loooonger...]
;W[gp];B[gq];W[dj]C[from walking up the slope to climbing that hill...]
;B[qk]C[this does make the hill look like a steap slope ;-)]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jd]
(;B[ce]C[Is this ok to attack from this side?

I think this move enlarge white's area?

Since White has played D10 Black sort of have to inwade somewhere and even though white gets a big area on the upper edge i personally find a shimari (white C15) even worse for Black.]

I give you a problem instead. Lets pretend black passed instead of E14 can White still cut?

(;B[qj];W[pl];B[jo];W[dm]C[I think I should Attack those group at Q6, but I don't know how.
It's kinda to late to kill it butblack can always make it suffer a bit. good points would be O7 (saying go ahead live i take territory instead.) Or S3 (who doesn't love to make monkeyjumps ;-) 
S8 is ok to but gives White S3 in return.
So of O7,S3 or S8 i find S8 most fun but O7 might be bigger.

13th or 14th line will most likly trigger white M16 so why not play black M16 and put O 16 under pressure]

It is to me the only move if black wants point in the center.
Try to keep your points along the edges because only a wery few games let's the center become points.

side = city walls
center = the open endless fields outside the the city];W[ln]

Your playingstyle is a solid defence then attack, like how i played. The only problem i found with this style is that the stronger i get the less time i have to build my solid wall.... truly frustaion, i can tell you. It has made me go GRRRR more then ones, hehe. 
My next step was getting an account at www.dashn.com a corean server. With fight, fight, fight, fight crazy players. Palying there will tell you where your solid walls are leaking but it will also force you to attack and not finish you wall if you want to win.
Though be warned your style will get messed up, stronger player will most likly complain at your club because your lack of good shape a sensible moves are forcing them to think of moves they didn't think you would usually play. most of the time they would be right about shape and sensible moves but if they die shape or good sensible moves doesn't matter...

And one more warning it can get a bit frustating when the war starts after maximum of 5 moves. 
My advice if you start to play there : 
You better have that battleplan ready before the game starts or you shouldn't be on the board at all.]

A stressfull move is Black at Q10 giving black the choise which side to build the wall if a 3-3 invasion appers.
R4 has the disatvantage of leaving the side wide open and at current board when Black wants White under.
I would love to play Q10 as Black now just to more or less force white to inwade. though D10 as white counter does make whites side almost as strong black. the differens is the 1 point more space in whites potensial wall, but how to best use that tiny differens you have to be stronger then me, or master 3-4 joseki and hope for the best :)]
