But I don't think i can afford an exchange at top left corner without having enlarged my group.

klin: B D6 good position.  C17 is joseki, but not an absolute move.]

klin: C6 unusual, may not be good.];B[co];W[cq];B[dq];W[dr]

;W[do];B[bo];W[ce];B[cf];W[be];B[jq]C[klin: B not bad.    B K3 play at L3 better, not too close to the strong white wall.]
;W[lq];B[jo];W[en];B[dm];W[lo];B[jm];W[po];B[qp]TR[lo][lq]C[I did not think of a viable solution tha would allow B use properly the right side.

In many other option (pincer), W can have B settle on the bottom. This was not acceptable for me because of the marked stones.

Any other point ?

klin: B R4 OK.  Actually R5 also works, but more complicated.]

;B[qj]C[klin: B R10 still needs to play at the LR corner.  You can consider P4, then S4.  The cornet is weak as it is now.]
;W[pp]C[klin: W Q4 may have better attack point.]
(;B[rp]C[may be R3 is better, but it requirezs some reading i did not do. I knew the following move for S4 though.

klib: B S4 is a safe move.];W[oq];B[pr];W[nc];B[qf];W[mr]C[I count the value of N2 as 7 points gote.

klin: B N2 is much bigger than 7 points gote, but may not be the good time to play it.]
;B[fo];W[em];B[gm];W[gn];B[go];W[eo];B[el]C[can this be played elsewhere ? (see next move questions)

klin: B E8 playable.];W[pb]C[1) is the exchange E8 / Q18 fair for B ?

klin: B E8 is a thick move.  Q18 gets territory.  Both are good.

2) is R17 not better for W ? (even if if finishes gote for W)

klin: R17 and Q18 are choice of W.  Either one is OK.

3) if E8 (the preceding move) were played top right : where ?
- Q17 ? -> is it sente ?
 -> does it really protect the corner ?

klin: Q17 (or Q18) big and threat to throw in at M17.


- Q18 ? -> I think W P18 is forcing B R17 (otherwise W R17). W sente

- P18 seems te me the honte move, but I am not sure.

klin: B P18 sente.];B[qc];W[ne];B[hc]MA[hd][je]C[Is this the proper line ?
Other moves I considered were H16 and K15

klin: K15 better.  H17 too deep, may be killed.  H16 not as good as K15.]

Is the side value of it worth the potential in the centre ?

klin: S12 big.];W[li];B[mh]C[klin: B N12 should play at K12.  I think attacking W M11 is a strategic mistake.]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[rh];B[jh]TR[qf][qg][rh]MA[pb]C[Because of Q18 which can become a B eye, I did not spend another move on top right.

The two stones R14 R13 have now very little value with S12, I think.

I this correct ?

klin: Yes.  But B losses a lot of points in the corner, what is the gain at the end?  If N 12 at K12, W won'y have S12 (which is big).]

I resigned a few moves after this.

- 37 top

B

- 14 bottom right
- 5 middle bottom

may be 6 more depending on H4 stones status
