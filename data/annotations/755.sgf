 something about a lonely stone like the one in C10 there are always
 2 possibilities to look at. You must take into account to not damage
 your own positions and to reinforce theweak ones and threat the
 oponents weak spots.]
(;W[ch];B[cm];W[co]C[Now blacks presence in the left has not changed
 very much compared with the other variation, but white's moyo is
 greatly reduced, the white stone at top left is not that reinforced,
 neither in the interesting direction: to M10 and the right black moyo.]
;B[fq];W[fo]C[This move looks a little "vague".
 What are the options for white in this situation ?

- Maybe a pincer at H3. Now black has space to slide to K2, taking away  white points and base and stabilizing quickly. If black answers with F5  then white E6 keeps on the atac.]

 wite's not so strong groups divided is far better.];W[ho]C[F5 has succeed in making black trick himself :)]

;B[lg];W[ke]C[Is it the good moment to cut ?

- I don't think so: black will run from M13 to the center, both threate
ning white right group and the moyo that could be made at the top, so p
laussible results are that white don't get points at the top because ne
eds moves to save the group or a sacrifice of this goup to get the top:
 in neither case nothing gained.];B[le];W[ld];B[jd];W[jf];B[jh]

 his move at the top, but the position left with the cut at L6 and the  tesuji at B4 looks dangerouse.]

 action: black J15 could become worrysome later.];W[dc];B[hc]

 at the top and an atack  on blacks center group could be definitive.]
;B[bh];W[bg];B[bi];W[cg];B[fi]C[Black has both taken yose points at the
 sides and reinforce the center while further reducing whites points at
 the top left ...];W[fh];B[gh]C[Risky, instead of G12, F10 is far more
 secure, if white plays G12 himself the cut at L6 looks very dangerous.]

;B[dj]C[Instead of D10 B9 is the proper move, but the center
 group doesn't look that healthy, J10 seems more urgent, the left group is
 already alive without D10 ( i can't find a way to kill at least )]
;W[ij];B[jj];W[ii]C[Black's eye-shape is spoiled, the cut at K9 means white's
 groups down are out of danger, the only problem is that black's ahead on
 territory, so if he can rescue the big chunk and to F13 will be well.]
