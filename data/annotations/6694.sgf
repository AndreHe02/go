C[I used to play go a lot (AGA 4-6kyu) but have not been able to play for years so I am just getting back into it... played this game against the computer but I'm sure I missed a lot any advice that can help me get back on track and up to speed quickly would help.



Hopefully the advice that follows will be of asssitance.  Because this is a computer opponent some of the play is fairly unpredictable/random from a human perspective.  

Hope it helps.];B[qd]V[0];W[dp];B[pp]V[0];W[dc];B[ce]V[0];W[fd]
LB[ed:1][de:A][cg:2][dg:4][dh:3]TR[dp]C[Not sure if my move number 6 after his move at 5 is good, seems weak

Your response is more commonly used after black A. 

You could have played 1 which is a little less passive than F16 and quite straightforward.  

You could also have tried a pincer at 2-4, which would have worked well with the marked stone.]

Hopefully the preceding suggestions are of use to you.  The best advice I can give is to play people, try KGS.  Generally, make sure groups are alive or have the potential to be before moving on (urgent moves before big moves). Take a moment every now and again to look at the big picture: how many groups do I have? Are they connected/alive?  Same for your opponent.  Don't let opponent's moyo get too big (not bigger than yours) . etc.

Good luck with your future games...]V[-49.6])
