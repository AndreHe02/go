C[Hello, I am white in this game. It's been a while since I played a game of go so I felt pretty unsure of many moves in this game. In the end, I felt like I won by only a little luck.

Alex: Hi, I'm a KGS 2k and I will do this review. Remember that since I'm only about 4 stones stronger than you, not everything I say has to be an absolute truth :)]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[markchang [6k\]: HI];B[op]C[azukit [6k?\]: Hello]
;W[dd];B[dk];W[jd];B[go]LB[dm:B][cn:A][gq:C]TR[dk]C[This was a pretty weird move to me and I had no idea how to respond.

Alex: It's an unusual opening by black, but at this early stage almost anything is playable (at our strength at least :D).

He's approaching the corner from both sides, but without applying much pressure, so anything that strengthens the corner should be fine. B would be my first intuition with the idea of pincering either of the marked stones next, but A that you played should be fine too. Another idea might be sliding to C.

In any case you should be aware of a possible 3-3 invasion and probably prevent it when you get the opportunity.]
;W[cn];B[dh]
(;W[cg]LB[dg:A]C[Alex: Too close to his group. Because A is now sente he gets free moves to make his group stronger.]
;B[dg]
(;W[df];B[ch];W[bg];B[ef];W[de];B[bh];W[qp];B[qq]
(;W[pp];B[pq]TR[op]C[Alex: This exchange leaves your stones in a rather weak position and the marked black stone is now in an ideal place. See the variation for the usual joseki.]
;W[qm];B[po];W[qo];B[rq];W[pn];B[oo]
(;W[rp]C[Alex: I think this is a bit slow. I would prefer expanding along the right side.]
;B[jp]LB[nc:1][gd:4][qf:2][eq:3][lq:A]C[At this point, I wanted to cut the two black groups at the bottom, but I wasn't sure how. Moving at A stood out to me, but it looked like I could get killed easily. (Or if I managed to survive, I would be making the black groups stronger.)

Alex: Invading isn't a priority here. There are still big opening moves to take. I've marked a few that come to mind (with 1 being my preferred choice). Later instead of invading you should also consider to just reduce his territory by approaching it from the top or from the left side.

Generally an invasion should only be played if it's necessary because you're behind in points (which you are not at the moment) or if there is an easy way to live and the opponent does not benefit from the outside strength that he gets in return.]
;W[qj]TR[rp]C[Alex: This is okay, but since you already invested a move at S4 which allows you to live rather easily it's probably bigger to play a move on the top and approach the corner stone.]
;B[mc]C[Black really likes to make far extensions, apparently.

Alex: Yes. It's only a little bit weaker than the normal knight's move though and the extra weakness is often difficult to exploit. It's certainly a valid choice here.]
;W[fc];B[jb]LB[kc:B][lc:A]C[Black really really likes to make far extensions. Those black stones at the top are pretty far from each other. They don't look very strong but I don't know where the weakness lies. I'm worried that by trying to attack them, I'll end up making them stronger.

A, which I played in the game, didn't work well.
B doesn't seem to work either.]
(;W[lc]C[Alex: You cannot immediately split the two stones. It's also not necessary. K18 was not a very big move and he left the corner unprotected so an obvious choice would be to play a 3-3 invasion and take his corner away (see variations).]
;B[lb];W[md];B[nc];W[nd]C[I feel like I should have played somewhere else.]
;B[kc];W[ld];B[od]LB[kd:A]C[Alex: Black is happy with this result. The corner invasion is no longer possible now. (although I think you might get a ko, but not a very favorable one) and there is cut aji if black pushes at A.]
;W[qf]C[Alex: Good. Very big move.];B[qh]
(;W[rh]LB[qc:A][of:B]C[Alex: No need to try to connect this way. You have two better options: The corner invasion at A is possible again or you could try to catch/chase the black stone by jumping out at B. (see variations)]
;B[qi];W[ri];B[qg];W[rg];B[pj];W[pk];B[oj];W[ok];B[nj];W[ng]
;B[re]LB[pf:A]C[Alex: Black finally protects the corner. I would not answer this move locally. Playing somewhere in the bottom left should be bigger. If you want to answer locally though, consider A as an alternative to what you played.]
;W[rf];B[og];W[oh];B[nh];W[pg];B[oi];W[of];B[qk];W[rj];B[pi]
;W[hc]LB[nk:A]TR[qg][nh][qh][oi][pi][qi][nj][oj][pj]C[Maybe I should not have tenuki-ed this move because I end up in a bad shape (in two moves).

A seems a lot better here.

Alex: I agree. You played well to leave black's marked group in awful shape. Now you should follow the attack through. You can easily break into the center by chasing the group, which is good because it is mostly under black's control at the moment, especially after he plays A now. Playing at A yourself is very big.]
;B[nk];W[ol]
(;B[lk]
(;W[hq]C[I didn't want black to take the entire bottom! But I wasn't sure what to play here.

Alex: H3 is a bit too far. Black could play G3 to cut it off. G3 is the proper move if you want to undermine his territory.]
(;B[iq];W[hp];B[ir];W[hr];B[ho];W[ip]
(;B[kq]LB[io:A]TR[go][ho]C[Now it seems like black is trying to cut me off from the center of the board. Which makes me feel compelled to invade.

Alex: Locally black has suffered from the exchange. Also his last move should be at A, which should also be your choice to gain access to the center. Also note that black might cause some trouble by playing F3 later.]
(;W[ml]LB[ij:C][nm:B][io:A]C[Alex: Too far. He will cut you off. A and B work better.]

;B[jk];W[ik];B[jl];W[il];B[ll]
(;W[lm]C[Alex: Optimistic. You're not totally safe yet. It's better to give up a few stones and escape with the rest.]
;B[ij];W[hj];B[ii];W[gk];B[fl];W[hi];B[ji]
(;W[kj]C[Alex: I would just escape. It's unlikely that these two stones will survive.]

;B[jf];W[if];B[kd];W[je];B[le]LB[me:A][ne:B]C[I played at A, but B looks so much better to me. Not sure what I was doing at the time.

Alex: B is slightly better, but the difference is negligible. Your stones are connected in both cases.]

(;W[cl];B[cq]C[Argh! I tried taking some of the side and corner I thought I had got taken away! This does not feel like a good trade for me.]

[mh:B][ei:C][es:A]C[Alex: Since this ends in gote, I would not play it right away.

Some ideas:
A is double sente (sente for both of you) so it's an important point to play
B is a nice sente move, because it threatens to save the 3 stones in the middle
C could be a good opportunity to make sure that he gets no territory in this area
