AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[Hello, I am Daniil and I am reviewing this game.
Since there were no comments in the initial sgf file, I haven't marked mine.]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[ic];B[qi]SQ[pd][pf]C[If you want to extendend from this shimari, R10 would be better.
But bottom and left seems more interesting, since this sides are uplayed yet.]
;W[dj]
(;B[dg]C[Personaly, I don't like two space jumps on the fourth like.
It gives you no useful influence here nor protects the corner.
You may play simple shimari or play somewhere else.];W[dm];B[gp]
;W[eq];B[dq];W[lp];B[jq]TR[eq]SQ[dq][dp][gp]C[You have a group that is a bit wqide and have an invader which might cause troubles later on.
Stone marked with triangle actually made cutting your marked group possible.]

(;B[mp]C[Playing close leads to mutual strenghtening and this is not profitable here.
See variations.];W[mo];B[np];W[ep];B[eo];W[fo];B[do];W[kq]C[Now  your group is cut.]
;B[lo];W[ln]C[W shouldn't have played this, it effectively killed his group and saved yours.]

That way can block connetion to W's outer group.];W[bb];B[ad]

(;B[ci]C[This is useful move but it doesn't take the whole board into account.
Now white is accamulating thickness towards center so it would be good to interfere.]

C[Good idea (see comment for move 76), but way too deep.];W[jh]
;B[kl];W[km];B[hi];W[gi];B[hh];W[hg];B[gj]C[This fight was crucial for the outcome of this match.
One of the most important things to remember here is to flee or build at sight.
Sacrifincg some of your stones might be the right price while you can kill your whole group trying to save them all.]

(;B[hk]SQ[gh]C[You have a great opportunity at G12.];W[ij];B[jk]

I marked two big points, that allows you to enclose chunks of territory.]

(;B[jg]C[It's better to protect right group with S13.];W[rh]
C[You played this one surprisingly well for 24k.
Your playing suffers from the number of things common to beginners, so my advices would be to
1. Learn to connect your groups and cut your opponent's. This also includes determining which groups might be cut.
2. Take the wholeboard situation into account. I suggest playing a bit more on 13-sized board where you could see consequences of your actions sooner.
3. Don't hung onto stones that should be sacrificed for gaining more profit than just saving them.

Overall, this things comes from practices especially if you have someone to review your games or even do it yourself.
As for the literature, I would recommend "Learn to Play Go" series by Janice Kim and Jeong Soo-hyun, volumes 1 (just to make sure you don't miss something) and 2 (this one would be most avluable now).

Good luck,
Daniil.])
