(;W[ph];B[pi];W[oh]C[Compared to the earluer shoiwn standard squence,
black is as strong as in the joseki on the lower right
but white's group is not so stable because it has no base.
black could further attack it.]
(;B[ci];W[ck];B[df]C[there is no need to play on the fourth line as white has a group on the top already.  the only thing black wants to do in this area is to live as soon as possible in order to not harm his moyo]

(;W[ce]TR[cf]C[If black plays at triangle, everything reverses to the normal exchange.
however, white has more options, such as shown in the variation]

[jf][nj]CR[ch]C[the black group is relatively safe now.
However, white has many threats so it is still weak and not in a position to attack itself.
I think it is therefore better to either play elsewhere (e.g. on the triangled intersections) or to live clearly (on the squared intersection e.g.)]

better?

Black finally captures the white ston.
This is quite big as if the white stone runs away, the black stone on the left is in trouble.

it only threatens to capture two stones, say 10 points.

no time to connect...];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[do]C[It is now necessary.]

In the opening white first made a few suboptimal moves but was then ahead due to incoherent black moves.
