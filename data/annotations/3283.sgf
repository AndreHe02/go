RE[W+Time]

C[Dear reviewer,

this is, I think, a game with an interesting development. I would like to have some comments by you about it. One of my main problems seems that I am insecure about when to make defensive moves. This led me to several dangerous situations.

Tilo

Actually, I think you should be less defensive, and more agressive. You missed several chances to attack.  When you did defend, the moves were single purpose.  Often there was a better defensive move.  You played very well in the endgame.

No.  You have to extend up, or white will get a very strong corner.]

(;B[fn]C[Since there is no peep at F5, you have a strong wall, so you should extend further, to get ahead of white.]

(;B[qo]LB[qn:A]C[I wanted to make a firm coner enclosure but in the meantime I think that A would have been better, aiming at connecting under.

I would play A , to take the most territory.  He can't invade behind A, since you would get a splitting attack against the invasion and the weak group in the lower center.]
;W[ol]C[You should be looking for a way to split the white groups.]
;B[oj];W[of]
(;B[nd]C[Look for a way to separate the white groups.  The corner won't die.]
;W[nn]C[Now the white groups are almost connected.  You should be looking for a way to cut them.]
;B[qe];W[qg]
(;B[mj]C[This kind of jump doesn't have much shape.  If you can't cut white, you can put pressure on white to make a better connection with more shape.]
;W[nk];B[nj]C[Now white is conencted, but you have a strong wall facing the white group above.  You should be thinking about how to attack it.]
;W[qn]C[Usually you would answer this move, but white is not threatening you corner much, so you shoud consider using your wall to attack the group above.]

(;B[po];W[pi];B[pj];W[mf]C[Now white gets the key point at the top, and your stones in the center start to look weak.  It's suprising how big this kind of point is.]
;B[ng]C[I don't like this peep.  Your wall below is strong, so there is no need to reinforce it.  Later, if white comes into the upper side, you might want to peep from the other side from o15.  Usually you want to peep from the side where the stones have a weaker shape, and not where you have a very solid wall.  If you are not sure which side is better to peep from, it is better to wait.]
;W[nf];B[ld];W[kf]
(;B[ji]C[This is pure defensive move, so I don't like it.  It would be better to find some way to defend in sente, or failing that, to defend in a way that leaves a stronger shape.]
;W[jd]C[The next move should be on the upper left side, but teh problem is that this could weaken the two black center groups.

Since your corner is alive, and the white group doesn't have two eyes yet, you should be thinkinag about cutting this knight's move.]

(;B[de]C[Is this a good point?

Yes, but I would rather aim at the cut at K15, since the white group in the upper right is still weak.]

;W[eb];B[fc];W[gc]C[This looks like tesuji, but it as a move from a different joseki, and doesn't work when black has a stone at F15.  Just play at F18.  Even if you don't capture the corner, you should get a good result.]

Yes.  Now it would be nice to be able to peep from O15 rather than O13.]

;B[pb];W[sb];B[ob]
(;W[id]LB[re:A]C[I didn't connect because White can cross under at A, and then I probably have to make a second eye.

White should use this move to secure the left side, or attack in the center.  The big white group is in no danger.]

The center is fine.  This move sets up the huge monkey jump that wins the game.  It's good.]

It is a little thin, but you did connect.  Earlier you could have made this connection stronger several times.]

;W[ig]C[
Black should have won this game.  White was ahead through the middle game, but made some large endgame mistakes, with the monkey jump on the left and giving up the upper right corner, and finally trying this cut that didn't work.

Black was thicker in the early middle game, but did not attack hard enough, and let white connect the weak groups.]
