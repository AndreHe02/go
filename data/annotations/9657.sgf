C[Hey Jez, I'm Mark.
I'll be using "M:" for my comments and "!!!" for an important move in the game.

I've also left a summary at the end.];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd]
;B[oq];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[mc]C[The following sequence makes this seem overconcentrated.

M: I'd say it's a little loose, but it's not a big deal at all.]
;W[qc]
(;B[pc]C[M: Now it's overconcentrated.

!!!
It is very important that you cut him off at R16. You don't have enough space for a base from N17-Q17

See Variation];W[qd];B[pe];W[qe]C[Maybe at P13 instead?

M: Sure. that looks fine, but the big mistake was definitely not splitting up his groups.]
;B[pg];W[pf];B[of];W[qf]TR[og][oe]C[M: It's still not bad, but just keep in mind that this shape gets really weak later on.]
;B[ph]C[Is this move necessary?

M: If you're going to play this move, you have to follow up. You have a wall, so you should be using that, but you need to be sure to have a way to live comfortably.]
;W[jc]
(;B[fq]C[Maybe

M: see my variation. This is not a bad move, but it feels like you were second-guessing your previous move.]
;W[cn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ip]C[I played this

M: not bad.];W[ci];B[gc]TR[cc][fc][hc]C[!!!
M: Instead of this move, I would suggest just going to C17 and giving him a framework. You have a wall of your own so it'll sort of cancel out. I feel like it's more fit for a safe hakuna matata style.

If you wanted to be more aggressive, try to lean to one side, it gives you more room to maneuver. So choose a triangle.]
;W[ec];B[hd]CR[ge][je][gg][jg][gi][ji]C[Too slow? Maybe G15

!!!

M: Yeah, when in doubt, jump out. It's almost never bad. The thing is you've made this a race to safety with G17 and both of your groups are far from any friendly base.]
;W[je];B[hf];W[lc];B[md];W[lf];B[nf]C[Feels like this should have been at K13: the B upper left group needs defending. I think I was afraid of W O15 or something.

M: Yeah, this wasn't necessary, but it requires some pretty good reading.]
;W[ig]
(;B[ee]TR[hg]C[!!! Most important!!!

M: this tries to force your opponent to take 4th line territory. It's too big a trade. However, your opponent may even choose not to respond and just surround you with G12. It would create influence that allows many invasions to escape comfortably.

Any move here will still result in an unfavourable outcome, but making eyespace in the middle of enemy territory will give your opponent many free stones.]
;W[de];B[ef];W[df];B[qh]TR[hg][gg][fg][eg]C[M: You are still behind enemy lines. It probably doesn't die, but ignoring it is not good, because your opponent can push you around while making points and influence.]
;W[iq]C[No idea how best to handle this.

M: Handling stuff like this takes practice, and it turned out okay.]
;B[hq];W[jq];B[lq];W[jp];B[ho];W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[np];W[lo]
;B[nm];W[jm];B[hl];W[kq]C[At this point W has three corners and I have no influence in return, and W has sucessfully demolished my framework on the lower side.

M: Not really, you got most of the points that you should expect from there. The biggest problem was the top-left corner.]
;B[ck];W[cr];B[hr];W[mq];B[dm];W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[gm]C[Worried about H8 stone being cut off, but in hindsight this seems slow.

M: No! This move perfectly connected both of your groups. I would 100% play this.]
;W[pl];B[pm];W[qm];B[rl];W[om];B[pn];W[ol];B[on];W[nl];B[mm]
;W[ml];B[no];W[qk];B[oj]C[Should have been at S7.

M: Experience, reading, reading experience. You'll get the hang of it.]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[rk];B[qn];W[sl];B[mj];W[lk];B[rh];W[pb];B[ob]
;W[qb];B[nb];W[hg]TR[rh]MA[ef][ee][hd][pc]C[M: You seem to have been disheartened by the attachments that resulted in successful invasions. I'm pretty sure that you could have escaped this move. You would have still lost, but it's not that bad a loss. The power of your S12 stone really knocks down the value of that corner.

Your two big problems in this game were just starting a race, then deciding to set up camp in the top left, and not blocking the right way in the top right. You had to spend a lot a stones there to feel safe.

Everything else is just up to practice or are fairly good. Don't obsess over the invasions, because they were fairly well played on both sides. Your problems were fairly early, so I'd suggest focusing on that.

If you have any questions you could email me at markwong14@hotmail.com.

Keep up the good work!])

(;B[qh]C[M: This makes your groups much safer, and you've cut of a stone.]

(;B[qd]C[M: two weak groups for black. When you're stronger in the area, try to split the opponent's groups.]
;W[pc]TR[od]C[M: If you're afraid of being cut, then P16 also works.]
;B[oc]TR[od];W[ob];B[nb];W[od];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[oe]
;W[pb];B[qe]C[M: Something like this would be good for you, since you have a lot of influence whereas W has a very weak group and a pitiful amount of points in the corner.]
