;W[or]C[I would continue in the lower corner at b because it is sente, it undermines w, and it should unite black.]

(;B[pc];W[kc]MA[mq][oo]C[b has weaknesses at x in the lower corner, so b really should play in this area.]

(;B[cn];W[cp]C[I probably would play at b, thinking that I would then get a chance to play at c and d.]

(;B[fp];W[fq];B[gq];W[eq]MA[gp]C[It's _urgent_ to repair the weakness at x.   Play b or x.]

(;B[dk]C[w a is very poor, overconcentrating the w group at top and swelling black's right side enormously.]
;W[oe];B[pf];W[pe];B[qe];W[of];B[pg];W[dg]C[I'd be inclined to play at b.  w28 doesn't do much at all.]

(;B[ci];W[ch]C[black a  leaves a severe weakness.  just play b.]

C[black a is way too conservative.  Seal w in with b]HO[1]
(;B[qk];W[fc];B[ec];W[fd];B[be];W[bf]MA[bk][eg]C[b is much better because it makes b fully alive and takes a lot of territory.

Only w's mistake made white a work out at all.

b has nothing much here because w can play at either x or at a.]HO[1]
(;B[de];W[bd];B[cf];W[ae];B[bg]C[w a is a pass!

w should just start the ko, and then b would be obligated to win it.]
(;W[af]C[black b would be huge, even if w takes the corner.]
(;B[ag];W[ce]C[b is in trouble.  I would like to limit the size of the ko by playing at b, but that doesn't seem to work..

The problem is that w's lower corner isn't surrounded, so a doesn't threaten to kill w outright.]

(;B[qr]C[w b kills black's upper corner more effectively than w is killed in the lower corner.]

(;W[pr];B[be];W[ad];B[bc];W[ce];B[sr];W[df];B[rs];W[pn];B[pm];W[on]MA[po]
C[a is wrong for two reasons.  First, b is sente, threatening to cut at x.  More importantly, a attaches to relatively strong stones, creating an instant weakness for black.  black c is much better.]
HO[1]
(;B[nn];W[om]C[You have already staked the game on making something of the "attack" on whe w stones.  You just can not afford to play a now.  Don't back off.]

C[b is much better shape.]
(;B[jp];W[gr];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[dn];B[dm];W[en]C[black a is a pass.  It has absolutely no effect on the w group, and is very small in territory, and leaves weaknesses behind.  Play b.]

(;B[fn];W[em]C[black a is a thankyou move, because when w answers, b is left with too many cutting points...]
HO[1];B[el];W[fm]TR[el][fn]C[The reason the previous move was so bad is that w94 creates the "cut knight's move."  The  stones are completely cut by white's stones, while the w stones are all connected.  You can't have worse shape than this.]
HO[1];B[gn]C[w should strengthen his stones, say at b, but black is in deep trouble: his left side group is very weak.]

(;W[gm]C[This is another pass.  It takes almost no territory, it doesn't pressure the weak w group on the right, and doesn't help the weak black group on the left.]
;B[hm]C[Finally w thickens his group.  After this sequence all black can do is repair his weak left group.]
;W[lm]C[Another thankyou move.  Any time you attach to a stone you strenghten both sides.  You are stronger here, so you are helping w a lot.

Black b is urgent.]
(;B[mm];W[ml];B[ln];W[km];B[kn];W[jm]C[good.];B[co];W[do];B[cm];W[ff]C[Attacking inherently makes you thin (defending makes you thick) so you should always be looking for solid attacking moves.  Play b.]

(;B[mh];W[nh]TR[mh];B[ng]C[w a is an overplay...];W[og]TR[ng][mh]C[This is the key point in the game.  Play b!  If you sacrifice the  stones you get tremendous leverage.  now it is w that is in trouble...

The difference between a and b could easily be 40 points.]HO[1]
(;B[oh];W[ni]C[oops.  a doen't work.  You must be _very_ careful when playing in your opponent's area of strength.]
;B[nd]C[w is way too strong for this to work "automatically."  You would have to read out that it works to before playing it.]
;W[oi]TR[nd][ng][mh]C[b is much bigger.  Even if you give up the  stones, they will have a lot of aji.]
HO[1]
(;B[od];W[ph];B[qh];W[qi];B[ri];W[qg];B[rh];W[qf]C[The reason this capture is huge is that now w has no weak groups.  w has the right to expect to kill _any_ invading stones in this area.

a is totally unreasonable.];B[kd];W[md];B[ld];W[me];B[lc]C[w could kill you with b.]

(;W[jc];B[mc];W[ne];B[jd];W[ic];B[pd];W[kf]TR[ng][mh]MA[pf][pg]C[a is the wrong for several reasons.  First, the  stones are not worth saving, because they are not cutting stones.  Second, w is enormously strong here after the capture at x.
