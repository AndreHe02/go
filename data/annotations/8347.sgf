Hi, I'm ZeroWave and I'm around 3k kgs. I'll be reviewing your game, with a focus on yose but also pointing out other big mistakes I see. I'll be noting where whte was wrong and how could you punish, and how white could have punished your mistakes.]

;W[lb];B[jc];W[jd];B[lc];W[kd];B[la];W[me]C[nice move by white. Now the P16 cut is more threatening.]

(;B[ej];W[bd];B[ac]C[This is the first yose comment. This is bad - A16 is correct, and even that should not be played now. C7, H3 - all of these are much bigger now.]
;W[cj];B[di]C[Aji keshi. What does this move give you? a few points. There is still a chance you might be able to use the aji there.]
;W[ci];B[ad];W[bf];B[ae];W[af]C[This is all sente, but H3 and C7 are alls till bigger. Remmember - threatining to kill a group of 30 points is sente as long as there isn't a move for the opponent that gives him 50 points. White can ignore and get something somewhere else which is much, much bigger.]
;B[be];W[ce];B[el]C[a bit too passive. D8 is better.];W[cm]

Indeed, your yose was preety much your downfall. Your main problem was the fact you played small gote/sente moves when there were much bigger sente moves around. First of all, I reccomend reading some simple priniciples on Sensei's Library about yose - not the math complex ones, just the simple ones, as "sente moves are worth roughly double of the number of the points as the same move in gote", and all abut sente, gote, and reverse sente. You should read all the yose moves in the board a few moves ahead and estimate which are bigger and play them. Overall:

1. Sente moves should be your first priority, always. If the move is trully sente, you shall recieve both the sente move and the move you wanted from the start.

2. Although sente is important, remmember that small sente isn't sente - a sente that threatens to give you 10 points wont be answered if there is a move which is worth 50 points.]
