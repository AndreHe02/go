C[Hello reviewer!

Thank you so much for helping me out!

I'm playing black, please comment mainly on my side.

I commented on some important things that I want to have a better grasp on. I probably missed a lot more.
Please, shine some wisdom!

I put comments and variations in between, and some general conclusive hints at the end. I hope this will help you improve.

Andre];B[pd];W[dq];B[qp];W[cd];B[oq];W[ec]LB[cj:A][pj:B]C[I thought it's better to cancel his extension than to make mine (Q10).
What do you think?

B is clearly the better move here. You don't want to invade if you're not behind.]
;B[ck];W[co];B[ch]C[This is very vulnerable. White can now essentially chase black around and make territory.]
;W[qf];B[qh]LB[pi:B][pj:A][pl:1]C[Good to pincer? I thought it would prepare a big corner extension.

This pincer is too far away from your stones. I would play A or B. This gives you a big moyo and still attacks the stone. Playing 1 later is investing another move while you can be happy with one move.]
;W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe]LB[lc:A]C[I would play A here. This settles this situation.]
;B[oe];W[of]LB[ne:A][pl:B]C[Big decision.

Should I press to A or make a nice frame at B?

Now you need to play A.]
(;B[ne];W[qj]LB[lc:A][nc:B]TR[qh]C[Regret.

This is another reason for playing closer to your stones earlier. The black stones have still a weakness around A or B. Trying to save the marked stone will result in trouble for at least one group.]

(;B[pg]C[This makes black heavy.];W[pf];B[pj];W[qk];B[pk]C[mistake?]
;W[qi];B[pi];W[rh]C[No way now to stop his connection, huh?

Yes. Now you need to focus on fixing your weaknesses and using your influence.]
;B[rg]C[Too fast, didn't read.];W[qg];B[ph];W[rf]LB[kc:A][jj:B]
[jq:C]C[One of these moves is needed here.];B[nf];W[og];B[nh]
C[Wanted to seal him in, is that ok?

This ruins the influence. It creates cutting points, and sealing white in does not help anywhere.]

;W[kd];B[jd];W[ke];B[gc];W[if]LB[id:A][ge:B]TR[fe]C[This didn't threat me. It gaved me 2 options.

I thought my group was not in danger and B would help me connect.

Living on this small space is not an option, it is way to unsafe. You have to play B here, or maybe the triangle.]
;B[ge];W[id];B[ic];W[hd]LB[hc:A][gd:B]TR[kc]C[Thought I can sill save the triangle group and still not be sealed in, so I chose B.]
;B[gd];W[hc]C[Any way to save the group now?

There is still a way to profit from this. See variations later.]
;B[hb];W[ib]
(;B[jc];W[gb]LB[ie:1]C[At least, I said, let me connect.];B[ie]
;W[ha];B[he];W[hb];B[je];W[fc]LB[gh:A][jp:B]C[Now it became a chunk of stones without eyes, and white is happy in the corner. A seems very important now. B too]
;B[jf]C[This move doesn't do anything. You either need to save these stones or leave them. This invests more money into something without getting anything from it.]
;W[kh];B[ig];W[mk];B[lk];W[lg];B[lj];W[ki]LB[gh:B][ql:A]C[A - Big move? But urgent?

Does B have priority?

B is still important, but I'm not sure whether you want to play it now.]

(;B[ql];W[rk];B[rl];W[sg]LB[gh:A][ip:4][jp:3][iq:2][jq:1]TR[lj]
[lk][ml]C[Still A has priority right?

I chose to extend, to have 1/4 of the board. Where to extend? 1/2/3/4? And why?

1 - 4 are more important right now. Playing high seems better because it is closer to the influence of the triangled stones. I would play 3, but 4 seems good too.]

(;B[ip];W[gq]LB[ik:A]C[How about A?]
(;B[hq];W[gp]
(;B[lp]C[This is ok right?

No. See variations.];W[kp]
(;B[ko]C[Seal him in, kill.

Instead of killing, let him struggle to live. See variations on the previous move.]
;W[lo]LB[jp:C][kq:A][lq:B]TR[jo]C[Where to go? Hmmm.

Generally, not the atari. This is almost always bad. Probably the triangle.]

(;B[lq];W[jo];B[kn];W[jp];B[io];W[jn]LB[km:A]TR[jr]C[Now white is out. Consider making the triangled connection at some point. Maybe play A now.]

Was I realistic?
Was the A group with no hope?

It is not realistic to make profit out of this zone anymore. Instead, focus on connecting.]

TR[li]C[Necessary? Isn't B alive because of seki?

No, white has too much liberties. Black is dead. But if white wasn't connected and lost the ko and triangled liberty, it would be seki.]

Was dissapointed because I felt that I have a better strategic game, only to loose with some errors, what do you say?

In conclusion, he was playing more calmly and took what he could. You always tried to take everything, and then lost most of it. Try caring more about fixing your weaknesses (cutting points, etc) and if your opponent really wants to take something, let him have it. Just take something else back at the same time (which will probably be more than what you lost). Also, don't try to kill everything, try instead to get sente and let him live in gote. You should probably practice shape and reading.]
