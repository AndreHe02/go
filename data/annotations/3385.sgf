C[Hello Jerry, I did this review for black as requested. It is a pity that you didn't pre-review your own game before sending it. It is easier to do review for reviewer when you let to know your ideas for your moves. In this case it is easier to point out misconceptions you have about the game. I tried to cover most serious mistakes I've noticed. Feel free to email me with further questions about the game.

Ilya Martynov];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qn];W[jp];B[cf];W[fd]
;B[ci];W[cl];B[bd];W[cc];B[fp];W[dn];B[fn]LB[hq:A]CR[jp]C[This move looks like a mistake to me. Move at A (H3) probably is better as it serves two purposes: it establishes a base for black group and it attacks marked white stone.]
;W[hq];B[el]TR[fn]CR[cl][dn][dp]C[This move is wrong. You played keima (also known as  knight move). This move is usually being played for attack not for defense. The reason for this is that it can be easily cut. Marked white group is quite strong so it cannot be attacked (at least now). My impression is that you are trying to connect you black groups but as I already wrote white can be easily cut. See variations.]

(;W[fr];B[mc];W[qf];B[qh];W[qd]
(;B[of]LB[qc:A][pg:B]C[This is very bad move. You let white make an easy life in the corner which was almost yours. You lost a lot of territory and white gets alive group easily. Very bad exchange. The proper play is at A (R17). See variation for possible course of play.

I guess you were trying to lock-in white in the corner but there is still a hole at B (Q13). And even if manange to lock-in white it doesn't give you and advantage in this position as the center is opened for other white groups.]
;W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ic]LB[ob:A]CR[cc][dd][fd]C[Good move - extends from your groups and attacks marked stones. Always try to search for double purpose moves like this one.

Note that you'll have to come back and fix a leak at A (P18) later.]
;W[hc];B[id];W[hd];B[dk]TR[el][fn]C[White still cut here the keima connection. See variation.]

(;W[mq]CR[dk]C[Very big move. If you were able to take this point first it would make a big difference in the game. I think this the point you had to play instead of marked stone.]
;B[cq]C[There are many variations for me to read but I think this 3-3 invastion should not work. There are two many white stones. Anyway both sides played suboptimal moves and you had several opportunities to make life in this corner.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[ep]
(;W[fq]LB[dr:A]C[Bad move by white. Should be at A (D2). See variation.]
;B[bp];W[do];B[bo];W[bn];B[dr];W[ao];B[aq];W[an];B[cn]LB[br:A]
C[This move doesn't work as you see later. At this point A (B2) is critical point of your group to make two eyes.]
;W[co];B[cm];W[dm];B[bm];W[bl];B[dl];W[am];B[fl]LB[br:A]C[You are spending time to fix a problem with keima connection you played ealier. But there is no time. Move like A (B2) is urgent to make life in the corner.]
;W[br]C[Group is dead now unless white makes a mistake (which he does later but which you didn't use).]
;B[bq];W[cs];B[as];W[bs]LB[ds:A]C[A but strange move by white - just connecting out with move at A (D1) ensures that black group eyesless and thus dead.]
;B[es];W[fs];B[er];W[gq];B[if]LB[nb:B][ob:A][qk:C]C[Fixing a leak at P18 is bigger. Imagine white playes A (P18) or B (O18). You lose a lot of territory - you were lucky that white didn't exploit this weakness in the actual game. See variation.

If you didn't had the problem at A (P18) then the biggest move would be at C (R9) which takes a lot of territory on the right side.]

(;W[rg];B[ob]C[Good.];W[pa];B[oa];W[rb];B[rh];W[or];B[pk];W[ho]
;B[hl]LB[pr:A]TR[eg][fg][gg][eh][fh][gh][ei][fi][gi]CR[cc][hc]
[dd][fd][hd][dl][el][fl]C[White played a very slow move which you don't have to respond in the same are. Your move doesn't achive anything - marked territory is opened for white group on top anyway so there is no reason for building a wall on 8th line. And your move doesn't threaten white's territory.

The biggest move at this point is A (Q2) to take the corner territory.]
;W[im]LB[ff:B][pr:A]TR[eg][fg][gg][eh][fh][gh][ei][fi][gi]C[Again you should not respond this move in same area. Still A (Q2) is the biggest move. Also white gave you opportunity to enclose white's group on top with move like B (F14) what would allow you to take the marked territory.]
;B[il];W[jl];B[en]CR[ep][fp]C[This move is hardly urgent. I don't think there is any danger for marked black stones. And anyway even if white can somehow capture them it is just four points and white will have to do it gote. There are way bigger moves at this point.]
;W[jk]
(;B[on]LB[pr:A]C[Quite small. Protecting the corner with A (Q2) is bigger. See variation on previous move and on this move.]

(;W[mn];B[mk];W[ll];B[ml]CR[ll]C[There is probably no need to answer M8. Again protecting the corner is the biggest move right now.]
;W[mm];B[nm];W[no];B[lk]LB[pg:A]CR[mk]C[Note that wall you are building is probably not very effective because of hole at A (Q13).]
;W[kl];B[mh]LB[pg:A]C[Again if want to make territory here fix a hole at A (Q13) first.]
;W[hm];B[hj]TR[eg][fg][gg][eh][fh][gh][ei][fi][gi]C[Quite useless move as you cannot expect territory in marked area as long as white group on top is not enclosed. See varation.]

(;W[ji];B[jh]LB[kg:A]C[When you play contact play you force your opponent to make his stones stronger. It can be right idea when you weak and your opponent is already strong in the area so adding to his/her group strength doesn't gain much while you enforce your weak group in contact play. In this case white is invading you moyo where you are strong so you'd better avoid contact play. Play at A (L13) is better then move you played as it doesn't let white to play forcing moves later in this area.]
;W[ii];B[hi];W[ih];B[hh];W[gf]C[White can play deeper.];B[gg]
;W[kh]LB[kg:B][jh:A]C[This is the forcing move white can play now because of contact play at A (K12). If you played at B (L13) instead of A (K12) white would not have such move.]
;B[jg];W[kj]
(;B[lj]LB[kg:A]C[No necessary (see variation). Just block at A (L13).]
;W[lg]C[Very bad. Now white enters your moyo and you lose a lot of territory.]

(;B[mg]C[Wrong side (see variation).];W[lf];B[le]C[You playing contact move again. This only allows white to play forcing moves later.]
;W[mf];B[nf];W[me];B[md];W[pe];B[oe];W[pf];B[oh]LB[pg:A]C[Better at A (Q13) if you want to fix your wall here.]
;W[ef];B[eg];W[fg];B[fh];W[ff];B[eh];W[bc];B[de]CR[bd]C[Note that white can capture marked stone. Protecting this stone is quite big. See variation.]

;W[he];B[hf]LB[ie:A]C[Wrong side - there is no need to keep you groups connected. They are both strong enough. This move should be at A (J15)]
