C[Hello, I'm 23k on IGS and I played black in this game against
a 6d. It
was a very tight game and I'd like it to be reviewed to find
out what my
mistakes were.

Thanks for your service !

Black plays very well. He plays in a solid fashion that means
it is a close game. As white is a much stronger player this is
very good. Black could have gained more at the beginning of the
game by playing his moyo strategy consistently rather than invading.
Also it is easier for Black if he plays solidly when white invades.
His cutting moves help white although black reads situations
well and keeps out of trouble.];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]

;W[fo];B[gr];W[en]C[At this stage black has played very well. If he invades then
it works against his strategy of building a moyo and inviting
white to invade and to then build territory while attacking so
carrying on building the moyo is blacks best option. I have put
in a few options for black]

the cup];B[iq];W[kd];B[le]C[

care and look down upon those single or 1x or 2x kyu .....

for 23k

 rosego 16k*:  seems that the people just care to win and in

 lakeland 3k*:  hmmm, almost.  RoseDuke reviewed the game with
me after he crushed me, I thought that was nice


In these kinds of situations where black is overwhelmingly stronger
in the local situation you want to avoid cutting white but rather
just keep pushing him into a solid clump. When you cut it creates
complications that white can exploit]
