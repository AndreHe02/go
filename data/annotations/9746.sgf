C[Hi, I'm andre8s and I'm currently ranked 5k in the EGF. Thank you for posting this game, this was an interesting fight with plenty of stuff for studying. At the end you played more precisely than black and almost won by a very large margin. However a single misread can always cost an already won game...

I hope that I can show you some basic shape problems within this review. There are several situations where you let your opponent push through a narrow gap between your stones. Also, you have a tendency for leaving problematic cuts unprotected. This leads to multiple weak and disconnected groups that are very difficult to care for simultaneously. As kind of compensation, your opponent had a tendency of playing many overcautious slow moves and giving away sente. 

If you could get rid of these shape problems in future games, I think this will already significantly improve your strength by several stones. I made further comments within the following moves (until move 224 whereafter the game is essentially decided), please take them with a grain of salt as I'm not an expert and please do not hesitate to contact me for further discussion.

Maybe the following pages give some further helpful hints:

http://senseis.xmp.net/?SqueezingOutTheToothpaste
http://senseis.xmp.net/?PushingFromBehind

Finally, I have some "homework": ;-)
- On move 38 you are trying to rescue three stones. Can you see how black can anyway kill them unconditionally in move 39?
- After you missed your chance to make black resign in move 220, black captures a single white stone in a ko in move 223. Imagine that you somehow win this ko fight, then you could still capture a few black stones and live in the corner. Can you find a ko threat in move 224 which black should not ignore? Then - after black answers and you take back the ko - what would be _his_ biggest threat? How do you think the ko fight would end and how do you assess the game situation thereafter?]
