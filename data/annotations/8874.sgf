RE[W+12.5]

C[Reviewer: Hi, i am a 9k on KGS. I havent played for a while though. I will start comments with a R:]
;B[pp]C[*matutaka*: Hi!];W[dd];B[qc];W[dp]C[hhhhaaanns: hi]
;B[pi];W[dj]
(;B[lp]C[R: This looks a liitle small for the opening. Its a good idea to spread your stones.]
;W[iq]
(;B[kq]C[R: This one is definitely too small. There is not a very big threat here.]
;W[jc];B[lc];W[cn];B[pm]C[R: Now you and white strenghten your loose moyos. I think is not enough try to do more than one thing at a time.]
;W[gb]C[R: This stone from white is very low. Not a good idea in the beginning.]
;B[kh];W[fq]
(;B[jq]C[R: This one is very unnecessary. You already had 2 stones there. Furthermore this third stone doesnt do much, as it bumps his head just into one white stone.]
;W[ip];B[ir]C[R: This is also too small. You gain very little territory with this, but you could play elsewhere. See the possibilities I showed before.]
;W[hr];B[jr]C[R: Now you lost the initiative for just a couple of points.]
(;W[cq]C[R: White should defend the other corner, as this one is already quite well protected and the other one is open.]
(;B[gl]C[R: This seems a little bit loose. You could go into the white corner.]
;W[db]C[R: Very submissive from white.]
(;B[qp]C[R: You defend your corner which is a good idea. You are strong to the left so you protect more to the upper side. Still I think the defense on R3 is more stable. You also wouldnt have the problems with later invasion.]
;W[pf];B[pd]C[R: Very solid. The risk of white running away is high.]
;W[nf]
(;B[nd];W[le]
(;B[md]C[R: This one is not necessary. You give white the opportunity to run. Also remember the shape of M15 and K17. Its the big diagonal jump. A could idea is to play right in the middle on L16 to separate the stones. This works here well, too.]
;W[kd]C[R: Now white is almost out. Your last chance is cutting around N14.]
(;B[kf];W[mf];B[ke]C[R: You cant cut the diagonal moves, you only strenghten white here.]
;W[ld];B[mc]C[R: This is not necessary.];W[ik];B[il];W[gj]C[R: Now you see that G8 was too loose.]
;B[kl];W[jk];B[kk];W[hk];B[hl];W[fl]
(;B[if]C[R: This doesnt do much. You can still try and invade the left side.]
;W[id];B[qf];W[he];B[hg];W[pg];B[qg];W[mh];B[kj];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[fg];B[fh];W[eg]
(;B[hf]C[R: Why connect here?];W[gh]
(;B[ie]C[R: Doesnt do much.];W[gd]C[R: White simply defends and gets rid of some weakness.]
;B[gi];W[eh]
(;B[hh]C[R: Dont take immediately. Often it is better to first strenghten yourself.]
;W[gk];B[ei];W[di];B[cg]C[R: I dont think the timing is that well. You should have invaded earlier.]
;W[ej]
(;B[fi]C[R: Just sacrifice E11. It doesnt help you as there is not much chance to cut white.]
;W[dg];B[cf];W[ce];B[bi];W[cj];B[bj];W[df]
(;B[ch]C[R: This is too slow.];W[dh]C[R: Mistake by white. Gives you time.]
;B[ck];W[be];B[bf];W[dk];B[cl];W[in];B[jl];W[kn];B[ln];W[gm]
(;B[bm];W[bn]
(;B[am]C[R: Not good. You waste a move.];W[ci];B[bh];W[an];B[cm]
C[R: Wasted, they are already connected. You also have 2 eyes for sure.]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[el]
(;B[fj]C[R: Doesnt do much.];W[fk];B[ae];W[bk];B[ak];W[ad];B[af]
;W[en];B[bd];W[cd]
(;B[ac]C[R: Again, dont take immediately.];W[bc];B[ec]C[R: Doesnt have much potential.]
;W[ad];B[ed];W[ab];B[fe];W[ge];B[hc];W[hd];B[je];W[gc];B[jd]
;W[kc];B[kb];W[jb];B[lb];W[ic];B[ja];W[hb];B[lf];W[nj];B[me]
C[R: Strange white allows you to cut.];W[ia]
(;B[ka]C[R: Just one stone. Dont defend.];W[oi];B[pj];W[ph]
;B[qh];W[li];B[ki];W[lj];B[ml];W[lg]
(;B[kg];W[lh];B[ij]C[R: Better surpress the right invasion.]
;W[nk];B[nl];W[ok];B[pk];W[pe];B[qe];W[oe]
(;B[od]C[R: Play elsewhere.];W[ko];B[lo];W[ol]
(;B[pl];W[om];B[on];W[mk]
(;B[lk];W[nm];B[nn];W[mm];B[ll]C[R: You had to play here anyway.]
;W[lm]
(;B[km]C[R: No point in cutting, as white is already alive.]
;W[jm];B[jj];W[hj]
(;B[hi];W[hm];B[im];W[io];B[jn];W[jo];B[hs];W[gs];B[is];W[gr]
;B[mn];W[oq]C[R: All would be a little easier if you had played R3 instead of R4. But still defending is no problem when you still block off your corner. White cant live without the corener. And your stones are all really strong and cant die.]
(;B[nq];W[op];B[np];W[qr]C[R: Now white has the corner.];B[pq]
;W[pr];B[nr];W[or];B[os];W[rq]
(;B[ps]C[R: Not good. You have to respond to white. And white can go up your right side.]
;W[qs];B[ns];W[rp];B[sr]C[R: First block. There is no point in taking eyes otherwise.]
;W[ro];B[qo];W[rn];B[rm];W[qn];B[oo];W[sq];B[rr];W[qq];B[rs]
C[R: Why doesnt white take? You both didnt see it?]
