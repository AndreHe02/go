C[Hi! When I played this game I felt somehow dominated. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong neither during the game nor after.

So I would appreciate comments on the big mistakes that I made. Especially the strategic ones.

I also put lots of comments and questions all along the game... You may tell me if I completely miss the point or if I am more or less right.

Thank you very much!!

Review by John Rae UK 3kyu

There are three points which I think would help your game a lot. In summary remember some go proverbs, there's a good reason for them :)

1. Using outside strength - don't use this to make territory, don't play close to thickness

2. Hane at the head of 2 stones - always press to attack when you have your opponent on the run

3. Don't give up sente for nothing];B[qd];W[dd]LB[dc:A][cd:B]
C[First question: is this reply good? Should have I played either at A or B instead?

JR: Nothing with it. I tend to play in the bottom left by habit but this is fine.]
;B[pq];W[dq];B[od];W[po]C[JR: Its all pretty standard so far.
Black's opening was designed to get the corner if you didn't approach the top earlier. Its considered OK for black because whatever white does black gets to pincer any stone played on the right and can gain from attacking it.

6 seems Ok. Another option might have been to play R9 or R10 to split up the slide. Black will now get a pincer move which is also an extension from the top corner]
;B[qj];W[oq]TR[dq]C[I have the impression that this is a bad move... I wanted to stress the lower side because of the triangle stone...]
;B[pp];W[op]
(;B[qo]C[I guess that this is too mild. He should probably have cut instead, right?

JR: This is pretty cautious by black but with R10 black can, I suppose, afford to push along the R file and take some territory.]
;W[pn];B[qn];W[pm];B[qm]C[JR: Generally this pushing from behind by black would be bad. Once the corner is alive I think black should leave it and play elsewhere, perhpas appraoching the bottom left.

White is getting a nice wall here so should be very happy. Its worth more than the * extra* 10 points or so black gets by continuing to push.]
;W[pl];B[ql]
(;W[jp]LB[pj:A]C[Play at A instead, in order to keep a control on blacks future moyo on the upper right area?

JR: If you want to keep black down and control the moyo P10 seems better than A. After A black would simply turn at Q11 and push up towards the centre.

Another  move would be around K16, or even N17 looking to dive under into the corner. To suppress the side there is also always the shoulder hit at Q11. So yes black has good moyo potential but its not too dangerous yet.

Why did you play K4? If your intention was to form territory from your wall I  it was a mistake. Perhaps many of your future difficulties come from this move.

 I would prefer D5 or C5. Let black jump in and attack him!]
;B[fp]C[I think that this was a bad move of his. Is that right?

JR: Seems very bad, I would  play D5 without bothering to think]
;W[do]C[JR: Yes :)

That black stone looks to be in big trouble. White should be expecting to make territory on the left and with the wall while chasing it out into the centre.]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ip]
(;W[jo]C[JR : Proverb- hane at the head of 2 stones

White is strong here, black is desperately seeking to live. OK 24 forms territory but it does not pressure black as much as I think J5 would]
;B[cp]C[Can I do something better to cope with this invasion?

JR: Black is effectively allowing white to make a stong wall and attack the J4 group and in exchange living in the corner.

This is good for white. If you capture those stones white has pretty much most of the lower half of the board]

(;W[dp];B[co];W[cn];B[bn];W[cm];B[bm]C[JR: You have to decide when you want to turn and attack the group cowering under your wall.

Perhaps now, perhaps push once more. I can't decide which, on balance I think you were right to push again.]
;W[cl];B[fn]
(;W[cq]C[JR: I think  the alternative attacks the side more severely]
;B[bq];W[bp]C[JR: This is not an effective attack - it forces black to make an eye and live.

White does get B2 in sente but that is not worth much at the moment]
;B[bo];W[br];B[ap];W[bl]C[JR:

No point in this move. If black ignores it he is still alive, so you have given away sente for nothing.

Its still best to attack the J4 group];B[df]C[Now I feel that the J3 group is very weak. Should I attack it now? If not now, when and how?

JR: Its been weak for ages.

Questions to ask yourself,

1.  is there a good pincer joseki which would put more white stones up the left to help this attack? If so perhaps its a good idea, especially if white can take sente from the joseki. (afraid I don't know one off the top of my head)

2. The joseki play at F16 - will it give a chance to play somewhere vaguely  around F10 splitting black into 2 weak groups.

3. Can I ignore this approach and attack now. F8 or F9 perhaps. These capping attacks will push black towards the right. So white will get to play  K7 or similar to keep up the attack while developing the territory in front of the wall. The capping stone will also help attacking the D14 stone

On balance F16 seems OK]
(;W[fd]LB[ch:A]C[I'm not too sure of this reply... Perhaps at A instead?

JR: I don't think A gets white terribly much. i think black would respond E13 and aim longer term to connect to the group on the bottom. 

Ideally white wants to find a move which splits black into two groups, both of which are under atack]
;B[ci];W[ce]C[JR: This is not really threatening black very much. There's lots of room to run. Anyway you don't need it to protect your stones on the top so it is time to take sente.

Attack, reduce at P10 or develop along the top, all these are more important]
;B[pk]C[All the forthcoming sequence was very painful for me... :o/

JR: Black judges the left is safe and uses sente very well indeed!]

(;W[ok]C[JR Black's next move at P10 is inevitable so perhaps consider a different response to Q9?]
;B[oj]
(;W[nk]C[JR: Black is gaining much more than white in this pushing. The moyo is developing nicely.

I would not feel so committed to the territory in front of my wall. I think the double hane is called for]
;B[nj];W[mk];B[mj]
(;W[mc]LB[jc:B][jd:A]C[I rushed here because I was afraid of a move around A or B.The moyo he was developing looked quite impressive.

JR yes I think you had little option but to try something like this but black can simply attach at N16 or pincer and eat away what territory you might get on the top

Perhaps B or L17 would have been better];B[kd];W[me];B[lc]

(;W[km]C[I screwed up here... Or perhaps in one of the preceding moves?

This is why the provereb says hane at the head of 3 stones. There are cutting points all over white's shape. You have to give way.]

Is black already ahead?

If white can still catch up, what are the move I should have played?

Thanks a lot for the review!!

JR: Yes black is ahead. More importantly black has lots of ways to attack white positions and so should pull further ahead in doing so. Only the black G4 stones look anything like weak and I don't see a good way to attack them.

Questions here are

1) is black properly dead on the bottom or does white need another stone

2) IF the group is dead does white try to safe the D16 stone or simply reduce black with something like P10 or better still invade on the top

 I'm not  certain of the answer, even with plenty of time to consider. Over the board I would worry that black F2 lived

I would certainly want to invade the top as soon as possible. White only has one stone in the upper half of the board so black has really strong influence over a huge area

White could run with moves like attaching at F16])))
