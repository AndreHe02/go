;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ed];W[qn]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[bridges: This move (R6) is generally too cramped and slow of an extension from the 4-4 point. It neither fully secures the corner (like the C16/E16 enclosure more-or-less does), nor exerts much influence, nor puts muchpressure on the black stones. A and B are much better.]
;B[dj]LB[pj:A][qj:B]C[bridges: This is a fine extension in front of the black shimari at the top. A and B are also
large since white did not play them. Of those two, B is probably the better since it doesn't allow white an easy extention to R9]
;W[nc];B[lc]LB[kc:A]C[bridges: A good place to pincer. Works well with the upper left corner, though I probably would have opted for the two-space pincer at A instead. Still, this is a fine move.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd]C[bridges: When you pincer, you have to be prepared to deal with moves like this.The point of a pincer is to remove white's base, prevent him from making territory on the side, and to hopefully to keep him weak. This is especially effective if the pincering stone is a good extension. You CANNOT just sacrifice the M17 stone immediately, because white becomes strong, AND gets territory on the edge, AND influence in the middle. If that happens, then your pincer has failed utterly. Here, you need to focus on saving the M17 stone, and in doing so either seperating white into two weak groups or making territory along the edge.]

(;B[ic]C[bridges: Ugh. See the variations.];W[kc];B[jp]C[bridges: Not a bad move, though a little high. K3 is probably better here as well, since an extension gives you a secure base. R10 is another big point, and perhaps better since white held back to R6 earlier.]
;W[mp];B[fq]C[bridges: Now see that K4 at K3 would have been a more secure position for black, and White N4 wouldn't have worked as well because black could slide under to M2 or N2.]
;W[dn];B[lq];W[mq]C[This highlights the problem K4. N3 threatens to attack black, but black doesn't want to allow the white extension to R10 or R11. If K4 had been at K3, this wouldn't be such a pressing problem for black at the bottom]
;B[qj];W[cl]LB[ph:A][qh:B][pb:C][pc:D][gc:E][gd:F][ie:G][cj:H]
[bj:I][dr:J][lp:K][hq:L]C[bridges: Okay, time to stop and evaluate how things are. Black looks well ahead in prospective territory at this point, though there are several invasion points to worry about. All of white's territories are fairly secure. At this point, black has to expect a white invasion because of the strength of the white groups and the large moyo that black has created. Also, where can black play to further reduce white's territory?

Black upper right: White can reduce this territory with moves like Q17, Q18, or Q12, or can invade at R12 or R17, so let's count this as roughly 20 points. Black can reinforce this territory at any of the points A through D, though none of these are pressing at the moment.

Black upper left: An imposing territory, though white has a very good invasion point at G17 because of the strength of the white stones on the top side. Also, white can slide under at B10 or invade directly at C12 or D12. If white does nothing, though, this territory is worth at least 40 points. Any of the points E through I would help this territory, and are fairly pressing because of the strong white positions on the upper right and lower left.

Black bottom side: This territory is very thin, trapped between the strong white position on the right and the fairly secure corner on the left. Black would to play at J, K, or L to help secure this territory, and all of these moves are fairly pressing.

Also available to black is the extension to R8. However, this is fairly small compared to moves that reinforce black's top left or bottom groups.   Of the moves available, I would probably opt to play D2 in exchange for C3, and then play either H3(L) or F5. This reduces white's territory on the bottom left, and helps secure the bottom group. I would expect white to invade at either G17 or C12, but would use attacking the invasion stone to help secure other territory in this area. This is important: you don't have to kill every invasion. If you can attack/chase the opponent's stones while making territory or thickness, this is a good thing.]
;B[ie]C[bridges: This is a fine point. It makes it hard for white to invade or reduce the top, and if black invades the left side, you can chase the invasion while further securing territory at the top.]
;W[cg]LB[dh:A][eh:B][eg:C][cj:D][bj:E]C[bridges: Not unexpected. The question, however, is how do you deal with it? It may be possible to kill this stone. However, black doesn't necessarily need to do this, and if you try too hard and fail, you may end up being worse off than if you hadn't tried.. What black needs to do is make sure that he gains something from attacking this invasion. There are several good ways to do this:
1. Gain a thick outer wall while making white live small. This will make invasions by white in other parts of the board more difficult as well, as those invasions can be chased toward the thick black wall. A, B, and C are all good for this. They put pressure on the white stone while emphasizing the center and helping make sure that the D10 stone stays connected.
2. Remove white's eye space white letting him escape to the center. Use chasing white to expand other black territories. D and E are good for this. However, this could turn into a running battle between white trying to kill the D10 stone and black trying to kill the C13 stone.

Because of black's thinness on other parts of the board, I prefer option 1, and would probably play at B.]
;B[fk]C[*johngrae*  I started a process of trying to surround the c13 stones but I soon got into a situation where I didn't understand what was going on.

bridges: This isn't a bad idea, but you're probably better off doing it with moves that place more direct pressure on the white stone and keeping him from living large if he does live.]
;W[eg];B[kf];W[ld];B[bj];W[fe];B[gd]C[bridges: Should be at F16. This lets white try and push through at F16.]
;W[hf];B[ig]C[bridges: Again, this lets white try and push at J14 though this is not such a problem in this case because of the L14 stone. Again, I would have opted for J14 or maybe K13.]

;W[gj];B[il];W[fd]C[bridges: beware the cutting point at F8.]
;B[fc];W[ge];B[he]C[bridges: should have been at H16 instead. See the variation for the havoc white can wreak.]

(;W[ee];B[dc]C[bridges: And now because of H15 instead of H16 you have to play this.]

;W[lb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[rb];B[cq]C[bridges: This is VERY bad. White can block at D3 and in containing the black invasion gain strength to attack the thin black group on the bottom. After this invasion, even if successful, black ends up with a thin black group trapped between two strong white positions. This is not SO bad here because of the black stones at G8, etc., but black also needs to worry about the cut at F8 up there. This move would be better at D2 (expecting the C3 followup), and then pulling back to H3 or H4.]
;W[dq];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq]C[bridges: and now it's clear what trouble black is getting himself into.]

(;B[co]C[bridges: perhaps a bit of an overplay, perhaps though it worked out in some sense. F2 isn't bad here, BTW, since it threatens to connect under.]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[bo];B[bn]C[bridges: choosing to abandon the corner with this move is not necessarily bad since you can probably cover the F8 cut in doing so.]
;W[bq];B[ao];W[br];B[do];W[fr];B[gq];W[gr];B[hr]C[bridges: This is dangerous. Let white crawl along the second line and make little territory. You can connect to the middle with a move like G6.]

;W[hq];B[hp];W[iq]
(;B[ir]C[*johngrae* At this stage I was feeling on the defensive, assumed I was well behind so had to fight everything.   Looking at it now all this close-in stuff only makes things worse. I'm not good at judging the score mid game. Should i have played back a bit and aimed to create territory in the centre while limiting white's expansion up the left?

bridges: At this point, you need to recognize that the black stone is essentially dead and cut your losses. A move like J4  or maybe K3 here instead is better. Also, you're not really that far behind. White got more on the right side than he should have, but if you can connect up the H4 stones and keep white fairly low on bottom, and maybe get teh R8 extension, you're still okay.]

;W[mr];B[kr]C[*johngrae* I felt I had to keep the potential by maintaining some liberties. would something like p9 o9 or p10 be better?

bridges: Much better. These stones are dead. Cut your losses and move on.]
;W[no];B[mn];W[oo];B[rl];W[on];B[om];W[pm];B[qm]C[bridges: too small. Moves like P10 are much larger. Locally, s6 is probably better.]
;W[rn];B[oj];W[ql];B[qk]C[bridges: S9 instead, as it keeps you from having to back up after white takes.]
;W[rm];B[rk];W[jn];B[in];W[km];B[kl];W[ln];B[jm]C[bridges: N7 instead]

;W[nq];B[ms]C[bridges: White need only connect here at O4 and black dies. Black's best hope after that is around  S3, but that should quickly come to nothing as well.]
;W[or];B[hs];W[js];B[oq]C[*tetsuo*(11:08:02):  Good move !

*johngrae*  And with one bound he was free - totally undeserved though. I don't think I had any realistic continuation if white simply played o4

bridges: Well, you played pretty well on the whole, with only a few really bad moves:
1. Abandoning the pincering stone.
2. Letting white live too large on the upper left.
3. Invading the 3-3 point in the lower left.
4. Not cutting your losses at the bottom sooner.

Of these, #3, the 3-3 invasion was the worst. Before you invade, think about the consequences of your invasion. Your opponents will typically make a strong wall facing away from your invasion. If that faces a weak group of yours, the invasion may not be a good idea.
You need to know when to choose between invasion and reduction (I do too :-) ). When you already have a weak group in the area, using reduction not only reduces the opponent's territory, it strengthens your stones. Invasions can remove more of your opponent's territory, but you need to choose carefully when to make them. Invading when your only nearby help is a weak group is usually a bad idea. It wasn't *so* bad in this case because you had some help at around G8, but still, be careful of choosing when to invade and when to reduce.]

(;B[kc]C[bridges: This is, apparently, is the joseki move in this position. I'd didn't know it, but I went ahead and looked it up as a starting place for this discussion. What you need to know is not the joseki itself, but the general theory to save the M17 stone and in doing so either gain secure territory or seperate white into two weak groups. M16 might work as well.   Again, the point here is not to memorize joseki, but to understand the reason for and principles behind the moves so that when you are confronted with slightly different situations where you don't know the joseki, you can figure it out yourself. Also, that lets you punish your opponent if he deviates from joseki.

The point of L17 is to start to make a base for black, and to threaten to push at M16 and divide white in two if white responds incorrectly.]

(;W[jd]LB[jc:1][ld:2]C[bridges: The joseki move. White aims for outer influence while black gets secure territory. White can't play at 1 here, because if he does, you can push up at 2 and he can't block at 3. (See the variation)]
;B[ld]C[bridges: Black threatens to seperate white in two or cut at O16. Of the two, the former is  worse for white.]
;W[le]C[bridges: White responds. Notice that white is emphasizing building a strong outer wall. This will work well in helping him secure territory opposite the wall, namely in the open area at the bottom of the board. Also, white needs to be careful of the cut at L15.]
;B[jc]
(;W[id]C[bridges: Again, white can't hane here because of the various cuts in his position and the threat of black using those cuts to push out at N15 and divide white. Notice also that, in this position, white can't ladder black if black cuts at stone at L15. (See the variations)]
;B[hc]C[bridges: Black jumps one, connecting up with his group in the upper-left corner. He has claimed secure territory through his pincer, and white does not quite have a strong outer wall yet.]
;W[ge]LB[cn:A][jq:B][qj:C]C[bridges: White plays here to prevent black from playing here and expanding his upper left while compressing the white wall at the left. White now has a fairly stong outer wall. However, white lost sente in the process, so black can claim one of the big points such as A, B, or C. Note also that black can threaten two cuts at N16 to gain some points as well, though there are bigger points on the board right now and the play to N16 is not sente.  (See the continuation)]
