[dts\]
Dear Reviewer,
I am playing black in this game.
The result is W+2.5
In this game there were two big mistakes. The first was where white let me reclaim the top left corner. The second is where I missed a huge killing opportunity.
My comments are marked with [dts\].

General comments for both sides appreciated particularly for fighting.

[Reviewer\]
My comments are preceded by a "[Reviewer\]", as above.

There are some points in the game where you make a comment, but I don't. This means that I think your analysis is fine, or that I have nothing to add.

In some spots, there are just far too many variations to show, so I simply show the straightforward one and one or two non-obvious ones. I hope they're good enough for you to be able to explore the rest of the variations on your own.

I summarize the game and mention areas which I think both players can improve at the end of the game.]

;W[on];B[qp];W[oo];B[qo];W[pq];B[pl];W[qq]LB[jp:A][nq:B]C[[dts\] r3 seems slow. I feel that the big point for white was around A.

--

[Reviewer\] 
I think R3 is fine. As you note later, it prevented Black from expanding his right side on a larger scale. Also, if White lets Black play R3, it creates a weakness around 'B'.]
(;B[ok]LB[nk:A][ol:D][jp:B][kp:C]C[
[dts\] ...However I was hesitant to play there and I wanted to expand my right side so i played kosumi. Now I ilook at it the kosumi seems small. Should I reduce or attempt to live in the B C region? I feel that living is too hard. What move do you recommend?


[dts\] In the game I though A was dangerous because of all the cutting points.(see variation)

--

[Reviewer\]
I agree that playing at 'A' doesn't lead to a pretty result for Black. White R3 is partly responsible for this, so I don't think it was a slow move.

Playing at 'B' or 'C' makes sense, but could also be too early. You might not be able to live directly, but it's fairly simple to run out at this point in the game. See variation.

If you wanted to expand your right side, then 'D' is probably what you want. Unfortunately, this also strengthens White's lower side. See variation.

The move Black actually plays here seems to be fair - it aims at both expanding the right side and reducing White's lower side.]

[dts\] This looked like a bad move for white.

Looks like an overplay, yes. Even if it isn't, it's too early in the game. There are far bigger points left on the board; 'A' and 'B' are two examples.]

[Reviewer\]

Once again, this is probably a big overplay from White. 

A move around 'A' is very big at this point in the game.

White might feel the need to invade very deeply at this point, but this move targets the wrong area. A much better place to invade/reduce would be around 'B', or if White wants to go in deeper, around 'C'.]

[Reviewer\]

Golden rule: When ahead, keep things simple. :) I think it's rather unreasonable to try to kill White here, especially considering the eye White can gain by playing at 'B'. D17 ('A') does seem much simpler. That being said, Black can still salvage this position after the cross-cut at the next move.]

--

[Reviewer\]

Wrong approach here, I think. Black wants to seal White in the corner - the center is the important spot. I would play at 'A' instead. See variation.

The approach starting with Black 'A', I think, disagrees with your assessment of the position. In the actual game, Black does get the corner when White plays 82. You considered that to be a mistake on White's part - see the variation at that move to see why I don't agree.]

This seems to be the right way to cause havoc and give White any type of chance to win the game.]

Well, based on the variation I presented, this wasn't being overcautious.

End of game. W+2.5

A short summary:

-White's move 20 was a big overplay. Black didn't manage to kill the invading White stones, but still got a great result. This was White's first big mistake.

-White tried another deep invasion with move 46. Black capitalized, and this time managed to kill the stones. This was White's second big mistake. At that point, Black was far ahead in the game.

-Black 77, however, seemed to have been a mistake. White took advantage with 82, caused some trouble, and managed to eliminate Black's potential in the center. Regardless, Black was still ahead.

-Black 121 was, in my opinion, Black's biggest mistake in the game. This threw White right back into the game.

-Black's reduction attempt at 137 seemed to have been too deep, and let White gain about 15 points, more than enough to give White the lead.

-Black 153 was a great move that cut off two White stones in the center. The game was very close yet again.

-With 175, Black cut off and attempted to kill White's entire center group.

-White missed a way to end the game completely with 194. White's third big mistake.

-Black then missed his own chance to end the game with Black 205. Black's second big mistake.

-The resulting ko fight eventually led to an exchange with Black killing two smaller groups and White reviving his top one. White eventually won the game by 2.5 points.


Areas that I think can be improved:

White tends to panic when he sees that an opponent has a lot of thickness. White should learn to try lighter reductions, and remember that there are much bigger points in the opening. White played fairly well after that and his lack of significant mistakes from there on, paired with Black's big ones, contributed to the close final result.

For Black, I think the 'golden rule' I mentioned a few times is a good one: keep the game simple when you're ahead! Black, I think, unnecessarily made the game too complicated at a few stages. Making the complicated when behind is a good strategy that Black did apply, however. 

You also mentioned a few times that it was difficult for you to read out the situation. This is partially why you want to keep the game simple and predictable if you're ahead. However, another way to approach this is to improve your reading skills - do Go problems. Playing games is nice, but I honestly believe that doing problems is the best way to improve your reading.]

This leads to rather complicated positions. I can't comment whether White lives or dies in the following variations. I've found some where White lives, and some where White dies. Exploring all of them is too difficult for me. I have included some variations (by no means exhaustive) that I considered to illuminate this difficulty somewhat. There are many different ways to play at literally every step.

All the advice I can offer at this point is to keep it simple -- it's difficult to NOT get a good result for Black here. Simply letting White live inside seems to be a good idea in most cases.]

Seems like White lives here as well. The worst I can find is a ko.]

Other way, definitely. This pretty much makes the two Black stones in the center useless and defeats the purpose of O9.]

[dts\] The two black stones look weak or is the fight worth it.

They don't have a base, but they can run in 3 directions. That being said, I don't think they can attack the circled White stones very effectively, and so Black doesn't achieve his aim of expanding his right side. I would prefer this position as White.]

Whether or not it's wise for Black to reduce at around 'A' now is a tough question.]

Not too dangerous for Black. This looks fairly simple as well - Black has some solid territory on the right, but in exchange for that, a running group in the center.]
