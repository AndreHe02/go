AB[pd][dp]C[Tukiyem: This is a 2 stone handicap game that I played on KGS. I'm Black (Tukiyem) 13k and the opponent Gaora8 is 11k so I got two stone handicaps.
{...}
I have never played against people who use opening moves like him. Can you tell me the proper response to handle such an opening?
{...}

MM: Hi Tukiyem, I'm Mike Malveaux, about 4k in the AGA.  The opening is not my strength, but I'll do my best.  :)]
;W[mc];B[oc]TR[qg]SQ[jc]C[Tukiyem: I realize later that this was a mistake. A friend told me that we only use this joseki in case there is a stone near K16 or 17. Why is that? And what is the better response? Is it R14?

MM:  This P17 is joseki and stakes a claim on the corner. R14 (triangle) is also joseki.

I'm not sure about your friend's comment, because if there's Black near K17 (square), then this White stone is already loosely pincered, and putting more Black in that area, so early in the game, seems overconcentrated to me.]
;W[rd]CR[qc]TR[jc]SQ[qg]C[Tukiyem: Now this is strange. Usually people I fought against will just slip to K17 for example. I don't quite know how to best response this. I assume that this is a trick and can be killed. That is why I jump to S15.

MM:  As you say, K17 (tri.) is more common.  R13 (sq.) also happens sometimes, and leads to the "three crows" corner.

Not all "trick" plays should be punished with killing.  I think it's a mistake to try to kill this stone -- after all, it has lots of room and two directions to run.  And it's very low with little potential for territory, so by itself it's not very important, except to the degree that it threatens your corner.  And White didn't continue the approach joseki, so White owes you a move already.

Since you said you want the corner (when you played P17), just play the 3-3 point (cir.).  Then you can attack whichever stone White does not defend.  (Not attack to kill, necessarily.  Attacking is a good way to grow your territory in sente.)]
;B[re]C[MM:  When you touch the opponent's stone like this, usually both sides will become stronger in the local area.  In this case, that's good for White, because Black is already strong here.  So getting locally stronger doesn't help Black, but it does help White.  So, it's often better to play a little farther away.]
;W[qe];B[qd];W[rf]TR[pd][re]SQ[rd]C[Tukiyem: Which I know wasn't really thought out. I made quite a lot mistake like this. Keima on the second row next to an opponent stone is a bad move is it not? Or I just use it incorrectly?

MM: The keima (triangles) you're talking about -- next to the opponent's stone (sq.) -- I know no general rule about whether it's good or bad.  I think it depends on the tactical and strategic situation.]
;B[rc]TR[jc]C[MM:  I think this sequence was not best for Black, but also it is not a total disaster.  Black got the corner; White got stability on the right side.  But Black has sente.  After White captures the stone, Black should pincer near K17 (tri.).]
;W[se];B[mb]C[MM:  This seems too aggressive, and likely to make the White stone stronger.]
;W[nb]TR[lb]SQ[me][ne]C[MM:  This also seems unnaturally aggressive.  I think White should play at M18 (tri.) to confine Black to a small corner, or jump toward the center with something like N15 or O15 (squares).]
;B[nc];W[lb];B[ob];W[ma];B[qb]C[Tukiyem: Making an eye quickly. Is this step good? Or I just waste a move?

MM:  This early in the game, with two corners open, I think it's pretty much a wasted move.  If White attacks, it's easy for Black to run to the center for a second eye.]
;W[jc];B[qp]C[MM:  Good!];W[nq]C[Tukiyem: I dont really know how to do opening by playing on 3-4 point so I use them a lot to experiment.

MM:  That's an excellent way to explore the board.  Sometimes it also helps to look at resources like http://senseis.xmp.net and http://eidogo.com/ and compare ideas with other players.]
;B[op]TR[qj][qk]SQ[rd][qe][se][rf]C[MM:  This looks strange to me, but Kogo's lists it as joseki.  If it soon results in a Black stone near R10 or R9 (tri.), then I think it's a good idea -- expanding the Black corner while limiting the growth of White's S15 group (sq.).]
;W[qr]TR[pr]C[MM:  This looks like an overplay.  Kogo's puts the proper move one line closer, at Q2 (tri.).]
;B[pr]TR[lp]SQ[qk]C[Tukiyem: Now I think this is another stupid move I made. What should I do instead?

MM:  Kogo's suggests a pincer at M4 (tri.), if White had played the normal move at Q2.  I think it's still a good idea.  Or you can probably do well with an extension along the right side, something near R9 (sq.).

But it's really tempting to attack these thin stones.  Divide and conquer!  This move, Q2, looks like it will work.  Just remember you may need to sacrifice something small to gain something larger.]
;W[pq];B[oq];W[or];B[mq]TR[nr]C[MM:  That looks like a mistake.  Better to use the forcing move at O2 (tri.) first.]
;W[np]TR[mr]C[MM:  I can't decide if this is crazy and greedy, or a good move.  I'm thinking maybe too greedy -- White could be happy with N2 (tri.).]
;B[oo]TR[pp]SQ[nr]C[MM:  I'm pretty sure Black should play atari at either Q4 (tri.) or O2 (sq.).]
;W[mr]TR[mq]C[MM:  Good move.  Now Black's stone at N3 (tri.) looks weak and silly.]
;B[pl]TR[qj]SQ[rd][qe][se][rf]C[MM:  This is a good idea.  I think Black's strong enough here to go a little farther, like R10 (tri.) -- and I think that since the White group is low around S14 (sq.), it's better for Black to play on the 3rd line.]
;W[qi]TR[ql]C[MM:  White would hate to see a Black stone here now, so White's pretty much forced to do this.  And Black will now have to invest another stone in this area, or risk losing much.  But if the earlier move -- Q8 -- had been on the third line instead of the fourth, say at R8 (tri.), then Black would be able to ignore this and take the empty corner.]
;B[qj]TR[qk]C[MM:  Seems too aggressive.  R9 (tri.) would be fine, I think.]
;W[rj]C[Tukiyem: Should just extend to R9 is it not?];B[rk]
TR[qk]C[MM:  Yes, it's simpler to just play at R9 (tri.).];W[qk]
;B[ql];W[pj]C[MM:  This is not too bad for Black.  White is overconcentrated.  Black should now take the empty corner.]
;B[rl]TR[rm]C[MM:  Too small.  If White plays atari there, then Black can answer with atari at S7 (tri.) and still live in sente.

Instead, Black should take the empty corner now.];W[rq];B[rp]
;W[lq]
(;B[dd]CR[dc]TR[ce]SQ[mq]C[MM:  Good.  I think C15 (tri.) might be even better, because it threatens to be a ladder-breaker for the N3 stone (sq.).  So, if White takes a move to re-establish the ladder or capture, then Black gets a free move for something like D17 (cir. -- see variation).]
;W[cj];B[cf]TR[mq]C[MM:  Good.  Don't forget that this saves the N3 stone (tri.).]
;W[db]CR[cm]TR[cc]SQ[fc]C[Tukiyem: Now this is another strange opening. Usually people jump to F17 so I consider this a trick move and again.. Want to kill it.  What is the best response?

MM:  I've seen this situation in games.  I don't think it's a "trick" play in the usual sense.  I think it's a probe, and it can run to the friendly stones or probably live in the corner.  Trying to kill it is probably too greedy.

I *think* the best idea is to take the corner with C17 (tri.).  White should extend toward the friendly group with something like F17 (sq.).  Then Black should follow up with pressure on the lone White stone, with something near C7 (cir.) -- a pincer *and* an extension from the lower left corner.]
;B[fc];W[ec];B[ed];W[fb];B[dc];W[eb];B[gc];W[gb];B[ge]CR[ej]
TR[cb]SQ[cl]C[MM:  This sequence was ok for Black, up to here.  Instead of this move, I think Black should either claim the corner with C18 (tri.), or pressure the lone White with C8 (sq.) or E10 (cir.).]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[id];B[gd]TR[cb]C[MM:  I don't understand this move.  It does not seem at all necessary.  C18 (tri.) would be much better.]
;W[bc]C[MM:  Very good for White.  Ouch for Black.];B[bd];W[cc]
;B[cd];W[cm]TR[dc][fc][gc][bd][cd][dd][ed][gd][hd][ge][cf]C[Tukiyem: I think that the group on E16 {tri.} are strong and making up a good shape so I just tenuki. Is this correct?]
;B[gq]C[MM:  Yes, this is much better than putting another stone in the upper left.  I don't really think it is tenuki though, since it is a relatively local response to White's most recent move.]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[iq]C[Tukiyem: His moyo are beginning to get so big :((.. I wonder.. when things like this happens should I just leave all comfort and be on the attack? H2 is too passive don't you think?]
;B[hr]TR[bq]SQ[of][ch][mp]C[MM:  Yes, it's too soon for this (H2).  The problem is that it makes only a few points for Black, and it does not threaten to kill the White group -- it threatens only to take away a few points.  So White can tenuki.

You can't really "leave all comfort and be on the attack" here, because White now has no weak groups.  At some point soon, you should protect the corner with B3 (tri.).  Other good points I mark with squares (C12, N4, P14).  They are not terribly big by themselves, but they have interesting follow-up possibilities if White plays tenuki -- so they should be sente.

Who is ahead now?  This looks like the transition from the opening to the middle game, and is a good time to estimate the score.

It looks to me like White's ahead by roughly 15.  Both players have multiple access to the center, so there will not be much profit there.  Best bet for Black is to keep sente as much as possible.   No White groups look weak enough to be killed, so Black's goal should be to keep them as small as possible and catch up in the endgame.]
;W[fo]C[MM:  This looks awkward.  White can't reasonably expect to join the two groups.  So this ends up being something for Black to harass.]
;B[fp];W[do];B[eo]TR[go]C[MM:  This looks like the wrong direction.  I'd rather play G5 (tri.), to better keep the White groups separated and maintain Black access to the center.]
;W[en];B[ep];W[co]
(;B[kq]TR[fn]C[MM:  I don't understand this move.  The atari at F6 (tri.) looks natural (see var.).]
;W[kr];B[lp]TR[mp]C[MM:  I think extending (tri.) looks more interesting.]
;W[mp];B[jq];W[ir];B[ip]C[MM:  This is looking better for Black than I would have expected.]
;W[hq]
(;B[gr]TR[hp]C[MM:  Don't save that stone!  You just played four stones -- one of which you probably need to sacrifice -- to split the White groups and keep access to the center!  Don't throw it all away by saving one measly stone worth about 6 or 8 endgame points!  Instead, connect your groups with H4 (tri.)!  Then if White captures here (G2), you get to seal the borders in sente.  (Var.)]
;W[hp]C[MM:  Of course -- the only move.  Now Black's four stones look like a tasty snack for White, and White is hugely thick with good prospects for the center.  It's a bit early to resign, but I don't see any obvious way for Black to win now.]
;B[lo];W[no];B[nn];W[mn];B[mo];W[pk]TR[mm][nm]C[MM:  This move makes no sense to me.  White does not need the eye.  Much better to develop the White stone with N7 or O7 (tri.).]
;B[mm];W[ef]TR[mn]SQ[ln]C[MM:  This works as a ladder-breaker for the N6 stone (tri.). The Black stones won't easily die, but White can get a nice reduction of the area where Black is thick.

Black should now capture at M6 (sq.), joining the groups and saving some stones.]
;B[fg]TR[dh]SQ[ln]C[Tukiyem: Now this. I trully believe that there must be a way to trap the stone. But I just can't think of some. If it's possible please show me the way and if it's not what is the correct response?

MM:  I'm not sure it's possible to kill that stone, but either way, it's better to start with D12 (tri.).  Because that's the direction of its friends, and you want to cut it off from its friends; and because that way, even if you don't kill it, you are making profit on the left side.  But really, I think you should join your weak stones on the bottom to your strong stones on the right (sq.).]
;W[dg];B[eg]TR[cg]C[MM:  Bad form.  White wants to connect, and you force him to do what he wants to do.  C13 (tri.) is better -- at least it makes left side territory for you.]
;W[df];B[cg];W[dh];B[ch];W[ci]TR[ff]C[MM:  White has nicely reduced the Black territory, and has follow-up moves like F14 (tri.) for further reductions in sente.  And Black's left-side eyespace is looking a little uncertain, so Black probably should not tenuki.  Nicely done.]
;B[bi];W[bj]C[Tukiyem: Cutted :(. No longer my territory :(..

MM:  It's still your territory, but it's much smaller than it should be.]
;B[bh];W[fi];B[hk]CR[of][hg][io]LB[mn:A]TR[jp]SQ[bq]C[Tukiyem: The plan is to get larger middle territory.. Guess too far? What is the best point to do this?

I got issues on how to advance to the middle.. Can you tell me of various things that can be done to go to the middle? Usually opponent are able to trap me on the corner..

MM:  A basic rule for advancing to the center is that, if there are no enemy stones nearby, then from one stone, you can make a one-space jump; from a two-stone group, you can make a two-space jump; etc.

Another interesting concept is the "sector line" as described by Bruce Wilcox in his book EZ Go, an imaginary line (often a diagonal line) between stones of the same color.  I think it's often good to play near the center of where your sector lines cross the opponent's sector lines.  Your move at H9 is pretty good that way, and also re-establishes the ladder to capture N6 ('A').

At this stage of the game, I think the plan to get more middle territory cannot work.  There is a proverb, "There is no territory in the center."  It's not *always* true, but in this game, White can access the center from three directions, and Black can too.  So the center will become a bloody battleground, but ultimately will not have many points for either side.

Often, the best way to make territory is by attacking (or threatening to attack) a nearby group.  But since White has no weak groups, that's not so easy to do.  Also, don't forget your own weaknesses in the K4 area (tri.).

I really think the best move now is defensive -- B3 (sq.), keeping a decent corner.  After that, the circled points (H13, P14, J5) look good for Black.]
;W[fk];B[hi]TR[gh]C[MM:  I dislike this because of the weakness at G12 (tri.).]
;W[io]TR[jp]C[MM:  Better for White to atari at K4 (tri.), I think.]
;B[jn]TR[ip]SQ[ln]C[MM:  Good to not save the J4 stone (tri.), but I think you should just capture at M6 (sq.).  You don't want to let White use the cutting points in that area.  It's often best to just get rid of dead stones, and remove their potential for trouble.]
;W[nm]C[MM:  See?  Black should have captured.];B[ln];W[on]
;B[pn];W[om];B[pm];W[nk];B[nl];W[mn];B[ol];W[nn];B[ll]C[MM:  Cleverly done.  It still would have been better to avoid all that and secure more points, by simply capturing the single White stone.

It looks like White's ahead by roughly 25, so it's still a tough game for Black.]
;W[mk];B[ml];W[me]C[Tukiyem: Trapped :((

MM:  Black should be able to live in the corner, and Black can still stop White from getting a big center territory, so this is not the real problem.  The real problem is simply that White's groups are strong and big, while Black's groups are strong but small.]
;B[oe];W[of];B[qf]TR[ne]SQ[nf]C[MM:  I don't understand this move.  O15 (tri., to make an eye) or O14 (sq., to sacrifice in exchange for leverage to reduce the White group) seem better.]
;W[qg];B[pf];W[pg];B[pe];W[mg];B[nf];W[ng];B[mf];W[lf];B[ne]
;W[le];B[nd]CR[lg][og][lk][ok][fn][qq]TR[sc]SQ[bq]C[MM:  Taking gote to make an eye now does not seem necessary.  Black can still live by playing T17 (tri.), so I think it's better to either keep the corner with B3 (sq.) or start using some of the small chinks in White's armor (circles).]
;W[if];B[gg];W[re];B[mi];W[ni];B[lh]TR[lj]C[MM:  Wrong direction -- M10 (tri.) looks better.]
;W[lk];B[kk];W[jh];B[ji]TR[ki][kj]SQ[lh][mi]C[MM:  I think L11 or L10 (tri.) is better for rescuing the two stones (sq.).]
;W[ii];B[ij];W[ki];B[kj];W[lj];B[jj];W[kh];B[ih]C[MM:  White gained in that sequence.  If my estimate is right, Black is roughly 40 points behind now.]
;W[ig];B[gm];W[fm];B[gn];W[go];B[in];W[gl];B[hl];W[jp];B[kp]
;W[bq]TR[br]C[MM:  Big move.  I think White could cause more damage with B2 (tri.), but since White is so far ahead, there's no need to take risks.]
;B[br];W[cp];B[dr];W[sq];B[qq];W[ps]
(;B[pp]TR[sp]C[MM:  No, it's better to play at T4 (var.).];W[sp]

;B[sj];W[si];B[sk];W[ar]C[MM:  This move is worth three or four points by itself, which is big for this stage of the game, and it sets up the trouble that the Black group gets into later.  Excellent move by White.]
;B[bs];W[hs];B[gs];W[is];B[sc];W[oa];B[pa];W[na];B[sd];W[rg]
;B[as]TR[gp]C[MM:  You need to be careful when you're filling your own liberties like this.  After White connects, you should connect at G4 (tri.).]
;W[aq];B[jo];W[ip];B[tt]C[Tukiyem: I start to pass.. Forgetting that there are still things that can be done :(..

MM:  Whoops!  I'd be lying if I said I had never done that.  Thanks for explaining what otherwise would have been a bizarre mystery!

I think all players should make a habit of filling all the dame.  Some tournaments use Chinese counting or Ing rules, where stones on dame are each worth a point.  And filling all the dame forces the players to be honest about connecting stones that need to be connected.]
;W[ok];B[tt];W[og];B[tt];W[pr];B[tt];W[gp];B[ho]TR[fq]C[MM:  No, Black needs to protect the lower left corner group now (tri.).]
;W[er]TR[fq]SQ[br][as][bs]C[Tukiyem: Now this is brilliant.. I recreate this a lot of time and found that actually there is no way to save the group.. But is there exist a way?

MM:  It looks to me like Black can save the stones by connecting at F3 (tri.) to make a seki (var.).  Even if Black doesn't make the seki, White can't kill the *whole* group if Black will sacrifice the three stones around B1 (sq.).]
(;B[eq];W[ds];B[fr];W[cr]C[MM:  Even here, you lose some stones in a snapback, but you can save most of the group (var.).]
(;B[cs];W[cr]TR[es]C[Tukiyem: In the end he won big :). But he deserve it. He is a much better player than I. How can I improve? What do you think I lack and how I can improve faster :)? Thank you very much sir^^..

MM:  First, the Black group is not dead -- capture at E1 to save 11 stones (var.).

How to improve?  Do life-and-death problems.  There are several at http://senseis.xmp.net and many more at http://www.goproblems.com as well as other places around the web, not to mention many good books with go problems in them.  If you do life-and-death for 10 or 15 minutes a day, it will quickly bring improvements in your play.

Also, try to be less aggressive.  I don't mean you should be *passive*, just that you should have more reasonable goals for your moves.  The point of the game usually is not to overwhelm the board, it's to give the opponent a little so that you get a little more.  (A 5-dan friend of mine says that you have to be generous to your opponent if you want to be a strong player. :-)

In terms of tactics, experiment with approaching enemy stones from a few spaces away, instead of touching them directly; and experiment with deliberately sacrificing a few stones.  And remember that you don't have to kill -- making territory in sente while chasing weak stones is often the better way.

And of course, keep playing and analyzing your games.  Good luck!
