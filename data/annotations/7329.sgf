AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[I'm still a very new player and not confident at all.  This game is me playing against GnuGo 3.6.  This game I spent mainly trying to understand proper thickness.  I get the feeling I won't get it if I use any amount of handicap.

(doitsu): Hi Xamien. This is my first review. I really would like to help you and i will try my best:)

You were asking about thickness  - so i would like to make a comment right in the beginning: In the opening and of course in the middle game it is important to keep the enemy from forming live, or almost live groups. Thickness means a lot of things, but i think important aspects of a thick group are:

1) It is easy to make them live - they have enough space to form eyes and enough liberties. 2 eyes means "infinte" liberties.
(dually:its hard to attack them and difficult to steal away the eye space)

2) They show some surface to the outside so that you can "press" the enemy against the thick group. Having surface to the outisde is generelly a good thing - so dually one could say if you lock in the enemy you have gained some advantage. The rule of thumb is, that territory on the 3rd line (f.e. white crawling on the 3rd line while black is pushing on the 4th line) is an equal result to the outside influence on the 4th line.

These are also attributes of good shape. Shape also covers aspects like
# connectivity (dually: cutting the enemy) and
# flexibility - when you have good shape you can, in case of an attack, choose flexibly between diffenrent good results. See also http://senseis.xmp.net/?AspectsOfSacrifice

When the enemy has a group that is alomost alive he is, so to say, "without worries". He has some sort of a base (usually seperating your stones) and can go on with seperating and attacking you. A weak group is something you can attack. And this is also the way your territory should be build. Its not good style just to wall off territory without attacking any enemy groups. The aspect of sente comes into play here.

There is a book of Akira Ishida "Attack and Defense". I think understanding the whole book is difficult. But the first 2 or three chapters would be __VERY__ usefull to you i think. There you can learn about power and territory. Everything I would love to explain you here is written there.

I hope it is ok for you if i don't comment every single stone. First of all i think i am no pro at all (i am a beginner, like you) and i probably can't exactly figure out the pros and cons of every single move. I think i will stick to strategy and maybe some small tricks if i can find some :)

I stopped to comment the game at around move 140 or so - this game was lost in the middle game and i think you won't make that much progress if you train your endgame skill now. Its possible to make quite some points at the endgame - but these points (maybe 30 or even 50) are pointless if really huge groups of yours are dying in the middle game - no offense - once i were 30k and got results against GnoGo which are worth my own comedy show ^^]
;W[dm];B[em];W[md];B[me];W[pf];B[of]LB[cj:D][dm:A][em:B][co:C]
C[(doitsu): I have the impression here, that you are trying to keep white on the edge with blocking moves at B in response to white A, while you are trying to build center territory. Keeping the center is generally a difficult thing, because the enemy needs just one so called "finger" to destroy all your territory.

-> http://senseis.xmp.net/?Finger
-> http://senseis.xmp.net/?SqueezingOutTheToothpaste

But even if you really want territory in the center, i think a contact play (like the exchange A-B) is not the proper way to achieve this goal. There is a saying, that a contact play is usually a defensive play and yields stronger white stones, meaning that you are actually strengthening white with contact plays, which is not what you want to do (or even accept) in this situation. Contact plays are done when it comes to special tesujis or when you have to watch out for yourself and make good shape for your stones in a tricky situation.

I believe there would have been nothing wrong answering A at C or D. This way the stone has even less space to form eyes (the attacking aspect) and besides - especially with C, you would be forming some territory.

I show you a short sequence of what i mean:]
(;W[pg];B[og];W[dg];B[eg];W[dh];B[eh];W[ce];B[de];W[fc]LB[de:C]
[og:A][eh:B]TR[qn][fp][cq][oq]SQ[fe][he][je][le][ne][ff][nf]
[fh][nh][fj][nj][fl][nl]C[(doitsu): I assume you are going for the marked territory. I think you see the problem, that i was mentioning before. White needs just one little worm to crawl through the cheese and all the effort to keep him on the side and grant him territory there would be worthless.

Usually when you build influence, you need to see varius ways of how to use it to make some profit indirectly. The term "indirectly" can immediately be associated with influence. Its just logical. If you build influence, you usually give territory and what you will have to do with your influence is to attack (=invade, seperate, maybe kill) in order to compensate for your lack of territory. If you like to have sure profit from the very early stage of the game, you can also try out corner enclosures.

With a hoshi in place, the triangled spots make up good places to do a corner enclosure.

Your blocking moves at A ,B and C are honest/consequent. Even if i have my doubts about them - you did stick to your strategy and that is a good thing to do.]
;B[fd]LB[fe:A][ge:B]C[Seems like I'm being led around by the nose but my intention at the time was to try to keep him out or at least keep him restricted to certain places.

(doitsu): I think you responded at f16 to keep him out of the center - again i think that a non-contact play at A or B would have done a better job - but thats just the beginner-opinion ^^]
;W[gd];B[gc]C[Am I shooting my self in the foot answering like this? Cross-cut I get, but follow up to it, I do not.

(doitsu): Its hard for me to tell...];W[ec]LB[fc:B][gc:A][gd:C]
C[(doistsu): I am really unsure here - but you just have to do something about A. If you lose it B and C get connected and all your center goes away.]

(;B[db]LB[db:B][gc:A]C[(doitsu): Now here - i think your stone at A is in danger. AND: If you lose this stone, white can march throuhg your territory in the middle. I tryed a litlle around here but i am not sure weather my answers are better than yours at B.]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[ge];B[ed];W[nq]LB[db:A][jc:B][id:C][cf:D]C[(doitsu): To me it looks like your stone at A has turned out to work quite good. Now seperating/attacking moves like B, C or D would be perfect.]

(;B[oq];W[np];B[nr]LB[on:C][pn:B][lq:A][mr:D]C[Someone told me I used a good sequence here but the most I get out of that is I was defending my future stake the corner.  So much for that idea, as you will see later.

(doitsu): I would have played at A, B or C - or even D. Most likely B. I think your move at o2 is good :)]
;W[nn];B[pn];W[mm];B[km]LB[id:B][md:D][pd:C][pf:E][lq:A]C[I thought I was connecting, but looking at this, it just seems like it was wasted.

(doitsu): I don't like this move at all. I would love to play at A and just let him run in the center - but this option is
a little critical because you love the center ^^

I also would love to play a forcing move at B or play somewhere in the area of C to weaken D and E at the same time :)

Finally - if you build a large center mojo, don't get afraid if white stones escape into your mojo as long as they are not alive. Roughly speaking you just have to make sure, that enough of his groups die in order to win the game. The nicest thing to do, is to make white choose which goup he wants to ruin in order to save the other, when just one of them is enough to win the game.

When you want to learn about influence - don't be afraid of huge fights - some people (or even Computers) just love to set up a so called dragon game. And you can't just always give in, just because some people love gambling this  much ^^

;B[kq];W[mk]LB[pl:A]SQ[qk][rk][fl][il][ql][qm][fn][in][qn][qo]
[fp][ip][qp][eq][iq][pq][qq][pr]C[(doitsu): Maybe just A here - huge trerritories/mojos on the side - life is still his problem.]
;B[mj];W[ie];B[ke];W[hh]CR[qd][co][eq]LB[hh:A][mk:B][mm:C]TR[id]
[qh][ok]SQ[cf][cj]C[(doitsu): Now here - do you recognize that this little ... is just running with his moves at A, B  and C ? He is the one who should be afraid - not you :D

I would love to make his life hard at the triangle marked places or seperate his groups at the square-marked places.

Or maybe just create some more thickness with a corner-enclosure at the circle-spots.]
;B[gi]C[(doitsu): Fine way of thinking - thats the spirit :D]
;W[ig];B[jg]LB[kg:A]C[(doitsu): Again i would prefer a non-contact play at A - do you know the lion-shape ?

http://senseis.xmp.net/?LionShape];W[jc]LB[kc:A][md:B]C[(doitsu): I would prefer A - maybe he lives with some effort. Ok so. You will kill B and/or get the corner.]

;B[jb];W[jh];B[kb]LB[ke:F][jh:A][jj:C][mk:B][em:D][km:E]C[(doistu): mh... i think you want to steal his base. I think white is aiming to connect A and B and go for C or D or E in the long run. Also your stones at F start to get surroundet.

;B[je];W[pl];B[ql]LB[pj:B][nn:A]C[this is where it starts going wrong for in trying to claim that corner.

(doitsu): The corner is yours - still. He is fighting for the life with his group around A.. Maybe he wants to isolate B.]
;W[hj];B[gk]C[(doitsu): I dont't like this move. 2 possibilities: You consider the white group not alive and you try to steal its eyes and let it run (shut it in in a non-contact way) or you consider this group alive and you accept that you lost your territory on the top - Annd start to make sure that some other group will die (attack/play tennuki)]
;W[hk]LB[dh:C][dj:A][dm:B]C[I wish'd I come up with a better response to this sequence but I don't know what that would have been.

(doitsu): Usually there comes a point when its not worth anymore attacking a group. Try to seperate his groups and go for something else - trying to maximize negative side effects for white. F.e. playing in the area of A means weakening C and B.]
;B[kj];W[hl];B[hm]C[(doitsu): This is a nose play. Sometimes an effective tesuji, when white has few liberties. But in geneal your stone has bad shape.

[km][jp]C[Did he basically cut me off here or would I have had a chance with a better answer?

(doitsu): You answered at A. You are indeed in danger here because your stones in the center get attacked by one group wich is almost alive and 2 other groups wich at least have lots of liberties for an upcoming fight. You will have to make some sacrifice here. I think the only group that can still be hunted is the one at N7... so there also lie your sente moves you need to maybe rescue your square-marked stones. I would consider B or C, but that is just a feeling. Things get very complicated here. It would be a nice goal to try to connect E, D and F here and try later how deep you can still go in the direction of your stone in the area of A.]

(;W[oc];B[fb]LB[pd:A][pf:B]C[I still don't know what to say about this group up here.  Am I getting the right idea for thickness or going overboard?

(doitsu): With this move you are going overboard ^^ Defending your stone at At would also attack the white stones at B - this would have something do do with thickness :P]
;W[mb];B[dc]TR[db][eb][fb][gb][hb][ib][jb][kb]C[(doitsu): Even without your last two moves this group is so alive like James Dean in his best years ^^ Remeber 6 die 8 live :)

(doitsu):  You can't let white attack your upper group much more, so connection would not have been that wrong.]
;W[ol];B[nj]C[I realize my mistake too late.

(doitsu): mh... but your spirirt was the right one here. Defend and attack at the same time.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[rn]
(;B[pm];W[qn];B[sn]C[And white has me in what should have been easy to fight.

(doitsu):Well i think you already have some insight where you can improve. The game was lost during this fight. I think you will gain the most profit if you sometimes let your enemy have an easy live (when you want to make shape for your own in order to attack some other spot and make things hard for him if you already have stable groups for yourself.

Life and death is a crucial point, because without beeing able to determine "how alive" a group is, you can't tell weather this group should be attacked, defendet, used for an attack or where you should better stay away from.

If you want to lean more about influence you can try out something... see the variation.

I hope I was helping you. I wish you good luck with your studies in Go and of course a lot of fun :)]

Black has gained thickness towards the center, white has a little bit of corner territory. It was important for black to keep A and B separated. If he did not, white A would live to easy. I wanted to show you this joseki because black did NOT CONTACT white r6 on purpose. He kept A a weak stone  - it has no base at all.

So i just suggest you keep in mind that attacking a stone usually means keeping him from building eye space through non-contact moves, rather than going after his liberties immediately with contact-moves (contact moves also reduce your own liberties and therefore they are easier to atari and therefore its easiert for your enemy to make use of your contact-stone).]
