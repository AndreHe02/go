C[Daze: 
hello reviewer i lost this game by 2.5 i made to many mistakes plz help me with them

yoyoma:
Hi Daze, I hope my comments can be helpful for you.

Overall, I think the thing I saw most in this game was that during fighting, both black and white had a tendency to make inside moves, rather than outside moves.

Black should strive to play more outside moves, and force the opponent to make eyes on the inside.  Outside moves have an effect on the entire board, inside only the local area.  It is true that there are cases where inside moves are urgent because they make eyes for one group and deny them for another.  So the trick is to know when that is the case, and when it's time for a whole-board outside move.]

(;B[ck]LB[dj:A]C[This is more commonly played at A, the Kobayashi Fuseki.  A was played 146 times in the database I have, your move was played twice.  However given it was played at all means it can't be that bad.]

(;W[ec]C[Both pro games white approached high, which tends to flatten the left side more.]
;B[de]C[Seems like a good idea, to prevent white from pressing your side lower.]
;W[cc]C[White contacted your stone, you should probably continue the joseki locally.]

(;B[nq]C[So black decided to disrupt the bottom instead.]
(;W[lq]C[This can become complicated, white could hold back to avoid complications.]
;B[no]C[Jumping out seems natural since white is not very strong in the area.  The running fight that develops is very complicated.  I've tried to point out some alternatives.]
;W[pn]
(;B[iq]C[Black could instead continue out first, and only jump in later.]
;W[lo];B[nm]
(;W[lm]
(;B[pr]C[This is wrong.  It's a running fight, you should be moving on the "outside".  This move is "inside".  It means it will have no effect globally, only locally.]
;W[qq];B[lr];W[kr];B[mr];W[jp]C[The result is that black's effort to make eyes has hurt his own J3 stone.  Note black still doesn't even have two eyes locally.]
;B[jr];W[ks];B[ip];W[jo];B[io];W[in];B[hn];W[im];B[go]
(;W[bp]C[White should make a leaning attack instead, see variation.  Again one of the players chooses to make eyes instead of going out in a fight.]

(;B[qr]C[Again an inside move.  This one is pretty big though so it could be ok.]
;W[rr];B[pq];W[qp]
(;B[op]C[Again though it's time to cover Q8.];W[qf]
(;B[pi]TR[nm]C[Daze: i dont feel some of my moves are correct and i no they arent but id like to no whats wrong with my play

A pincer here doesn't seem necessary.  It feels hard for white to make points on the right, due to O7.]
;W[qc]C[i decided not to take thickness but due to the end result i didnt like my decision was there another way to do this]

(;B[pc]TR[jc]C[Usually to play this you need the extention on the top side to already be in place.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[qe]C[You can see clearly now that black has a problem.  He needs to extend now for the wall to make sense, but the wall is not very strong.]

(;B[gc]C[Black decides to attack these white stones to make some sense of his wall.]

;B[be];W[da];B[ga];W[ac]
(;B[ba]C[Again black chooses to remove eyes before the group is surrounded.  Inside move before outside move.

Sometimes it's good to gouge the eyes, and force opponent to run, but it seems most players choose this too often.]

[ef]C[Again too easy on wE14.  I see you're concerned (correctly so) about bH18's eyes, but bJ17 will help a lot with that.  In any case it's easy to see that black has failed to make B19 payoff much.]
