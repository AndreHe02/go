C[Thank you for reviewing my game.  This was a game that I regret losing that I could have won if I knew where to play.  I made some careless mistakes and I hope that you could help me with them.

EmTom: This is a hard game to comment because the position after opening is quite unusual. I tried to do my best though and I hope youll find this review helpful and that youll enjoy it. So... Have fun!]
;B[pp];W[dp];B[pd]
(;W[qf]C[Did I attack too early.  I saw it in pro game and I was experimenting with it.

EmTom: Well... I think its possible... but i prefer to play corners first.]

(;B[qe]C[EmTom: This is a very bad move by black.];W[pf]C[I thought that I should have played Q10 to make a solid base. what do you think?

EmTom: This is the only move. In fact you should be grateful that blacked forced you to play it. Black is making you stronger. Normally this goes like that:]

(;B[md]
(;W[pj]C[When I was playing this game, I was going to play at D17 or D16 as an extension of my stone at D4 and to settle in the corner.

EmTom:  Than you should do it with your 2nd move instead of approaching black's corner.  

EmTom: You probably want to play Q10 at R10 unless you attack blacks corner with R6 which would finish your shape on the side.]

(;B[qm]LB[rj:A]C[EmTom: Black doesnt allow this to happen. Later he can slide to A trying to take your base away.]

(;W[no]LB[no:X]C[Was this a good move?  Can you give me some other moves to try also?

EmTom: This is a bad move. It doesnt do anything. It lets black reinforce the corner and does not give you any points at all... You said earlier that you wanted to play d16 or something like that... So? What happened? You already changed your mind? Remember that you start in corners then go along sides and then play in the center.]
;B[nq];W[po]C[I tried to seperate black  but it failed.

EmTom: Yup... The result is good for black. Your group is getting heavy.]
;B[qo];W[pn]C[Should I have connected at P5 instead?

EmTom:  I dont know... I think this shape is a bit better... but in either case your group is going to be heavy... you want to avoid being heavy especially so early in the game.]
;B[qn];W[mp]LB[ol:A]C[I wanted to block black out of the center and confine him to the corner.

EmTom:  Hmm... Black should thank you for this corner. Its huge! Besides black can jump out at A anyway]
;B[dd]C[EmTom: Big point for both of you.]
(;W[dg]C[Did I extend too far?

EmTom: When I look at this move I see approach move not extention... Well it is an extention too but I think this part is less important now. You should play closer to your opponents corner as shown in variation.]

(;B[hc]C[EmTom: I should comment for W but this is important so I say a word. This move does not defend either side. There are holes at f17 and k17, l17 or l16. So black should play this move to defend something (for example at f17)]
;W[dk]C[EmTom: Hmm... So many stones on the 4th line... black is leading on territory now so you should think about making some for yourself too. Now you only have influence on the right side. Black can invade there easly]
;B[je]C[EmTom: This is too slow. Black is giving you a chance i think.]
;W[mq]C[I didn't know where to play so I tried to make a base along the side.

EmTom:  Its a good move as it blocks black from entering bottom from this side. Works quite well with your influence on the other side of the board.]
;B[jj]C[I think that move shut me out of the center because I was too concetrated on the sides.

EmTom:  Basicly you are very concentrated on the center. You have no teritory on the sides. Only influence.]

(;W[ip];B[ng]
(;W[ni]C[Would J9 be a good move?

EmTom: Better... It seems that at this moment both of you started to play small moves. This one is bad as whites shape is terrible here.]

(;B[li];W[mh]C[I thogut that this move would break up black andsecure more territory.]
;B[lg];W[mg];B[mf];W[nf]C[EmTom:  No need to do that now. Its not that big.]
;B[me]
(;W[of]LB[dq:A]C[I was scared that if black played there, I would lose alot of points.

EmTom: Nope I think it was better to leave it for now. There are bigger moves on the board. For example defending against 3-3 invasion.]
;B[lh];W[mi]C[EmTom: Small];B[hh]TR[ig][jg][kg][ih][jh][kh]
[ii][ji][ki];W[ce]C[Again, too concetrated on the sides.

EmTom:  You are not too concentrated on the sides. Sides are good. Take sides whenever you can. You only should worry about not allowing your opponent to have whole center. So take sides but cut to the center from those side positions.]

(;B[de];W[cd];B[cc];W[df];B[ff];W[bc];B[dc]
(;W[ad]C[EmTom: This is a bad move. Theres no need to play there at all. You are behind on teritory so you should play moves as big as possible now.]
;B[mk]
(;W[pl]C[EmTom: I dont know what you wanted to do here too... it doesnt give you any points]

(;B[ql];W[qk];B[pm];W[on]C[EmTom: Let black cut... Just ignore it... you have no points there amd your groups are safe so...  who cares?!? 

EmTom: I think you answer your opponents moves too often... You should think more whether you have to answer a move or there is something bigger somewhere else.]
;B[om];W[nm];B[ol];W[pk];B[nl];W[mm]LB[mn:2][nn:1]C[EmTom:  So... you are taking those 2 points?!? ;)

EmTom: Dont answer when you dont have to!];B[km]C[EmTom:  Look where your biggest potential is. And defend from that direction.]

(;W[ln];B[gk]C[EmTom:  Very soft];W[fh];B[gg];W[gi];B[hj];W[hi]
;B[ii];W[fj];B[fo];W[fp]
(;B[ho];W[hp];B[go];W[gp]C[While trying to protect the sides black was shutting me out of the center.

EmTom: Your bottom became huge... but not big enough... Black knew what he was doing. He reduced your potential then jumped into the corner to reduce your teritory. If you fail to stop that...  game over.]
;B[cq]C[Can you give me a way to practice on my Joseki, because I had no idea what to do

EmTom: Hmm one way to learn joseki is to learn moves and then practise practise practise... You start to understand moves more then... Its not a very good way though. Better way is to understand moves when you learn joseki. Its very hard though and not always possible.]

(;W[dm]C[I lost the corner here

EmTom: Dont push black into your teritory.];B[cl];W[bl];B[ck]
;W[cj];B[bk];W[an]C[I plyed this out very poorly]
(;B[ao]C[EmTom: oops];W[bp];B[am];W[bq];B[cr];W[br];B[dr];W[er]
;B[dl]C[I had a hard choice to make, where should I have gone?]

(;W[ds];B[dn];W[cs]
(;B[em]
(;W[ap]C[EmTom:  Not a good move. Ok it gives you 1 point in sente but 1 point is not that much and you lose quite a big ko threat here.]
;B[al]
(;W[ek];B[do];W[cp]C[EmTom: Ok so this is worth about 6 points... if black enters your teritory with b11 you lose more than 10. 

EmTom: It is very hard to count yose moves values correctly, but you should try to evaluate every move if you have time for it, then you should chose the biggest one. To learn more about how to count those values go to Senseis library (http://senseis.xmp.net) There are also good books covering this topic.]
