C[[xedover\] hello and thanks for letting me review your game.  I hope my comments prove useful to you.  let me know if you have any questions about my comments.

Your primary lesson from this game is to learn to count your liberties and to keep your groups together by protecting your cuts:

every time you place a stone on the board, ask yourself these questions:  how many liberties does it have?   is it connected to another group of stones?  if so, how many liberties did it add to that group?  did it make contact with an opponents stone or group of stones? if so, how many liberties did it remove from that group?

your groups can be cut apart easily if they do not have enough liberties.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[cp];W[qd]LB[oc:C][od:B][pd:A]C[[xed_over\]  A, B or C?  If A, how many liberties does the white stone (R16) have?  Four.  

After Black plays at A how many?  Three.  

But then how many will black have?  Also only three, and more importantly, whose turn is it next?

Either B or C would be better.];B[pd]LB[pc:1][od:2][pe:3];W[pc]
LB[qc:A][od:C][pe:B]C[I am not sure how i should've played in these following moves(6-15~)

[xedover\]  now each white stone has 3 liberties, and the black stone only 2.  Suddenly black is behind.

the contact play might be used in preperation for a cross cut play at A.  Sacrificing the corner for influence toward the center.

extending to B or C are also good]

[xedover\]  given the current situation, not so bad.  its only one stone -- but don't forget to count your liberties for your remaining groups (M17 has only two - atari is next)]
;B[qe];W[rd]
(;B[re]LB[kc:A]C[[xedover\] A is more urgent];W[kc]C[And stupidity wins again..

[xedover\]  not to worry, you're still way ahead in influence]
;B[cf]C[[xedover\] nice, don't worry about your stones at the top, but keep the pressure on White]
;W[ch]C[[xedover\] also good move for White]
(;B[cd]C[[xedover\] although this many be a joseki, for now, try to avoid these contact plays -- count your liberties, and stay ahead in the count

contact plays are used to pick a fight (and possibly sacrifice a few stones) to help make your weak position become stronger.  But you already have a strong position, no need to pick a fight.  Instead keep the pressure on White.  

When you are strong, let your opponent pick the fight so that you can capitalize on his mistakes.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[de];W[ed]
(;B[ee]LB[dk:A]C[[xedover\]  not necessary yet.  I wonder if A might have been better]
;W[ck]LB[cl:A]C[why would he have played there? why not continue with what he was doing?

[xedover\]  white is falling behind, he needs to invade and establish a base, though I think I would have extended out another space or two,  But this two space extension is a good solid move.]
;B[di]C[[xedover\]  nice pressing move];W[ci]
(;B[dk]LB[dj:A]C[[xedover\] count your liberties

D11 has only 3, but the White group it touches has 5
D9 has only three.

Black at A would have been better.]
(;W[dl]LB[dj:1][ek:2]C[[xedover\] how many liberties do you have now?]

(;B[bm]LB[dj:A]TR[di][dk]C[[xedover\] drawing back at A would have been a better move to strengthen the two triangled stones.  

let White keep that tiny bit of territory on the side, while you keep a strong influence toward the center.]
;W[cm]TR[di][dk][bm]C[[xedover\] hummm... now you have several weak stones.  which one to protect?]
;B[ek];W[el]
(;B[cj]LB[qk:B][bn:D][fp:A][iq:C]TR[dj]C[is this a good move to make?

[xedover\] its certianly better than your earlier move 11, because you now have some protection (triangle mark) but otherwise I would say no.  I think you only help white get stronger with this move at this time.

I would have chosen a bigger move myself.  A, B or C perhaps.  or simply drawing back at D]
;W[bj];B[dj];W[bl]TR[bm]C[[xedover\]  now white is settled and black is still in trouble.]

C[Stupidity is my worst enemy right now.. But later it turns out good..]

;B[fl];W[en]TR[fk]C[I'm blocking semi-good

[xedover\] learn to block from a distance instead of making contact plays.

you can let your opponent live small, while you establish a larger (and stronger) territory for yourself.

you leave too many weaknesses by not keeping your own stones connected (and by not protecting your cuts)]

(;B[fn];W[do]

(;B[jc];W[jd];B[jb];W[gc];B[fd]C[could I've played better?

[xedover\]  maybe.  I'm not sure the invasion was necessary.  when you're ahead, you can play safer, more defensive moves.  instead of K17,K15 might have been better, or even the bigger moves along the right and bottom sides. (see the variations for move 67)]
;W[fc];B[gd];W[bf]LB[qk:C][fq:B][nq:A]C[[xedover\]   mistake for white. White should take the bigger moves on the right side or bottom instead.]

;W[ag];B[ah];W[bh];B[ce]C[YAY!

[xedover\] nicely done indeed. not sure why white fought this losing battle, it only served to strengthen black and weaken white.]
;W[ai]LB[ak:A]SQ[bi][cl]C[[xedover\] white only has one eye so far. I think Black at A might kill (or at the very least reduce White to nothing and save the lost Black groups).

[xedover\] you can't win on tsumego alone.  even if that last minute capture had been big enough to turn the game around, I would have still felt like I had lost the game as black.  because you were 63 points behind just prior to that great find.  but mistakes are indeed part of the game and a win would have been a win -- and it was a great find.

you should concetrate on counting the liberties of your groups and protecting your cuts,  even if you lose the next several games while learning to do that better.

combine that with your go problem solving skills and you'll improve very quickly.
