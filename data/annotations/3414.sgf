C[---
Hello, im groden and playing white in this game
I won although I believe theres room for improvment, escpecially 
in the beginning.

N: Hi. I'm Nacho. I'll review your game. I hope the comments 
are useful.
My comments should be prefixed with "N:" (like this one).];B[pd]
;W[pp];B[dp];W[cd];B[ec];W[df];B[fe]C[---
looked it up and this black move doesnt seem to be joseki but 
had no idea how to benefit
---

N: No, this doesn't look like joseki. But I can't think of a 
good way to take advantage of that at this stage. When that happens, 
it probably means that it's not the time to take advantage of 
it. Just leave it like that and later that black stone will turn 
out to be at the wrong spot.];W[cn]LB[nc:C][qf:A][fq:B]C[---
better to extend to C10 or something from the top right corner?
---

N; I like this better than C10. But I would have chosen one of 
A or B. 

I'm not so sure about A, as black can extend to C, leaving less 
room for the invasion of the top you should already be thinking 
about. But anyway, I think it is ok, there is still pleanty of 
room for that. 

But W8 is not bad at all, it is just that it looks too one-sided 
to my liking. Probably a matter of style.];B[ck]LB[en:A]C[N: You can also jump to A with W10. B9 will be attacked and white 
will build strength to enter the top side.

But the corner invasion is ok, B9 will end too near to the black 
thickness.];W[cq];B[cp];W[dq];B[ep]
(;W[eq]LB[bp:B][eq:A]TR[cn]C[N: This is not the joseki move. I don't know why this is wrong, 
but is possible that the reason is that the sequence played in 
the game reduces the aji of the marked white stone.];B[bq];W[fp]
;B[fo];W[gp];B[nq];W[lq];B[qq]
(;W[qp]LB[qp:A][pq:B]C[N: Wrong direction. You have no extension on the right side.]
;B[pq];W[op];B[np]C[N: Mistake];W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[nr];W[qr]
C[N: Good punishment. Since you have no extension on the right 
side, getting territory is good.];B[rq];W[rr];B[oo];W[qn];B[rp]
;W[ro];B[pn];W[sp];B[nn];W[qi]C[N: I don't like this. Better an approach to the upper right stone.]
;B[qf];W[kc];B[ic];W[nc];B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb];B[pb];W[jd]
LB[ke:A]C[N: I think it is better just to jump out to A.This way you are 
strengthening black.];B[id];W[nf];B[ch];W[go];B[fn];W[dc];B[eb]
;W[di]LB[cb:C][db:B][ek:A][fk:A][el:A][fl:A]TR[cn]C[---
wished to reduce blacks territory on the left side, is this the 
right move ? didnt turn out all that well
---

N: I'm thinking of something around A. It threatens to save the 
triangled stone. On the other hand, this move is ok, but it may 
but your upper left group in danger. Maybe you should add a play 
at B, as black C is painful.];B[dh];W[eh]LB[ei:A]C[N: The usual move here is the stretch at A. Here you leave a 
cutting point, and leaving cutting points where you're outnumbered 
is asking for trouble. I think black should immediately cut at 
A.];B[ei]C[N: Which he does :)]
(;W[fi]LB[fh:B][ej:A]C[N: This atari is usually wrong. In fact, you should have a very good reason to play it. What you're doing here is forcing black to extend to A, strengthening himself, while you still have to go back and get rid of the cutting point at B.]

;B[fl];W[fk];B[em]LB[dl:A]C[N: A is better]
(;W[cl]LB[cl:A][dl:A]C[---
was aware this was very risky but felt I didnt have that much 
to loose
--

N: not much chance for this to work. And you do have something 
to lose. If nothing else, a ko threat. But here playing at A 
is better.];B[dl];W[dm];B[el];W[bo];B[bp];W[bl];B[bk];W[dn]

;B[bn];W[as];B[cg];W[ac]C[N: I hope the review is useful. I didn't comment much on it, 
but I think your main problem is the constant atari. That only 
strengthens your opponent. It's hard to stop doing it, I know, 
it took me a while, but I think that is worth at least a full 
stone in strength.

Another thing is that you seem to tend to leave your groups alone until they're nearly dead. That's dangerous. You could have lost the game that way a couple of times.

Well, that's it for now. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate in contacting 
me.
