C[Thanks in advance for reviewing my game.

Hi,
my name is Davide Ferreira and my rating is only 18 kyu, so dont think that
my comments exact, i just hope that they can make you a better player. :)

You played a nice game, altough both you and your opponent made several mistakes.]
;B[pd]C[In general, I was unsure
 of myself during the fighting on the left side. Plus I made a couple of downright dumb moves.]
;W[dp];B[pp];W[dc]C[Up
until now everything is fine, black played at the star points focusing more
on playing for influence instead of territory and white made a balancing
decision between both, by playing at d4 and d17.

General opening rule:

Play at the corners, they are easier to protect
Then when all corners are taken play for the sides 
Then play for the middle.

Remember
that if you play at a 4-4 point (D4,Q4,D16,Q16) your opponent can almost
always invade at the 3-3 point and make a living group

In the opening
you should always try to expand your territory as soon as possible avoiding
small moves, remember if you play a good opening your opponent will have
a harder time catching up the lost territory.]
(;B[oe]C[This is not a very common move because its a small one and does not really controls territory.

Usual moves at this point are: 

Q10
K16
D15

All of these moves are big moves.

My favorite one is indeed Q10 as it the biggest point in the board at the time.]
;W[jc]C[This
move is not very good either as white playing on the 2nd line makes too little
territory while there are other big spots on the board.

Before playing a piece remember, your opponent best move is almost always your큦 too.]
;B[mc]C[Black is putting too much stones in the top right while more than half of the board is empty.

Proverb: Dont put all your eggs in the same basket.]
(;W[qj]C[The
invasion of the corner by white would result in black building influence
and an incoming large fight for live, white by playing R10 insured that black
does not make a huge moyo.];B[pi]C[Dont play that near an enemy stone, R12 would protect your upper territory better.]
;W[qm]C[Necessary extension, but you leave these stones many moves wihout help...]
;B[qo]C[Nice way to block white and make territory];W[cn]C[Nice extension.]
;B[lp]C[It큦
a nice extension from Q4];W[iq];B[kq]C[Whenever you make a play try to figure
if there is a better spot... C11 looks bigger than this....

White should at this time play somewhere around D10.];W[cf]
C[its another extension from a stone, ensuring the corner.]
;B[kb]C[looks small again. G4 would be nice. As such white should take the opportunity to play it.]
;W[gc]C[Black could attack your 2 stones at R7 and R10... and make at least some outside influence]
;B[kd]C[Try
not to make an empty mouth, your opponent will try to push through it to
divide your stones. Always try to maintain your stones together.]
;W[qc]C[That invasion is bound to fail and white got lucky with it.]

(;B[pc]C[Black should have played R16 and push it against his streght.]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[re];B[rf]C[Black got the corner.];W[qf];B[pe]
;W[rg];B[rd];W[sf];B[rc];W[of]C[I felt okay about the corner unti this move... I'm sure there's a m=
uch better move I could have made, no? This move gets me nowhere, in the lo=
ng run.

This set of moves were good only because black didnt used his force to attack you.]
;B[qb]C[Wasted
move... Q14 is interesting...];W[me]C[White is trying to "attack" but remember
that white is still fragile, black could have played N14 or N15]
;B[nd];W[md];B[ld];W[ne];B[nc];W[lg]C[White got away with some nice influence...

The safest play would always had been Q11 insuring some living space along the side. there is still a weakness at P14.]
;B[lf]C[does not accomplish much... White could have responded with N14...]
;W[le];B[ke];W[kf];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg]C[Black got you here....]
;W[mh];B[ng]C[You are trying a ladder but black has a ladder breaker: Q11.]
;W[kh];B[pf];W[pg]C[missed that my group was in atari... a mistake that I make too often.

Those stones look lost anyway...];B[og];W[oh]C[you need to play more solid, and leave less weakness behind...]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[se];W[sd];B[oi];W[nh];B[ni];W[lj]C[Nice you are containing black and making some outwards influence...]
;B[mi];W[lh];B[sh]C[Not the best play for black...];W[ri];B[jf]
;W[ie]C[Yes! you ignored the atari to make another play. Learning when to make that is one of the things of a good player.]
;B[je];W[if];B[jg];W[ih];B[jh];W[ji];B[kg];W[ig];B[kc]C[You
got away with a good position again, because black was afraid to risk.]
;W[jb];B[li];W[ki];B[rh];W[qh];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[ib];B[mj]
;W[ml]C[you cant play that away, L9 is safer...];B[lk];W[kj]
;B[mk];W[ok];B[ll]C[Black got away.];W[lm]C[Dont cut just because you can...]
;B[mm];W[nl];B[km];W[nm];B[mn];W[nn];B[ln];W[jl]C[Again you got the better half of the cake. :)]
;B[no];W[oo];B[op];W[po];B[pn];W[on];B[om];W[pm];B[ol]C[You could have safely played at R6.]
;W[pl];B[qn];W[rn];B[qp];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[sq];W[so];B[rq]
;W[kk]C[You should have immediatly played S7...];B[kl];W[jm]
;B[jn];W[in];B[nk];W[oj]C[I realize now that S7 is much more im=
portant here. At what point should I have played it - after black plays S3?=]
;B[rm];W[rl];B[sn];W[sl];B[rn];W[qi]C[Not necessary yet, there are bigger points out there like D10 or C10.]
;B[jo];W[io];B[jp];W[ip];B[jq];W[ir];B[jr]C[I also think I spent too many moves building these wall=
s on the J line and not enough (none, in fact) extending from these walls.]
;W[hm];B[ik];W[hk];B[hi];W[gi];B[ii];W[jk];B[ij];W[gh];B[il]
;W[im];B[is];W[hs];B[js];W[hr];B[hl];W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[hj]
C[Black died in this play if only you consolidated your wall... at F7]
;W[gj];B[fl];W[gm];B[ek];W[fj];B[el]C[Black
is again trying for territory that dosent belong to him... if unsure of what
to do contain first and dont allow for the creation of eyes...]
;W[ck];B[ej];W[di];B[ei];W[eh];B[fh];W[dh];B[fg];W[fe];B[gf]
;W[ge];B[hf];W[hh];B[he];W[id]C[Everything fine until now...]
;B[hd];W[jd]C[Wasted move, if black played there you could still connect.]
;B[fm];W[fo];B[fn];W[gn];B[en];W[dn];B[eo];W[ep];B[dm];W[cm]
;B[cl];W[dl]C[This was the mistake... if a group cant make eyes, dont just trow stones inside... B8 would do the job right.]
;B[dk];W[bl];B[cj];W[dl];B[bk];W[em];B[al]C[At this point you should connect and black might still die. Connect at C8.]
;W[dj];B[cl];W[bm];B[fp];W[go];B[dm];W[ci];B[bi];W[bh];B[ai]
;W[ah];B[cg];W[am]C[You ignored a stone that divided your stones... always a dangerous situation...]
;B[ch];W[bg]C[bad play. you make an empty triangle and you push black to capture your stones... D13 is a better play.]
;B[dg];W[eg];B[ef];W[df]C[Black can capture at B14.];B[ff];W[ee]
;B[fi];W[bf];B[hc];W[hb];B[gb];W[gd];B[fb];W[eb];B[fc];W[fa]
C[This move is not necessary, just contain black and it will die.]
;B[ga];W[ea];B[ic]C[This move is dangerous because it can make your group dead by ko, in doubt play safe at K10.]
;W[hk];B[ec];W[cb];B[dd];W[ed]C[my worst move in the whole game, I think. I'd like to say I was so =
focused on capturing the F18 group I killed myself.

That큦 true, D15 looks better.];B[de];W[ce];B[fd];W[cd];B[ha]
