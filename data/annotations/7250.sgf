C[This is my first game on 19x19... :o)

I'm playing Black

It's ended one-sided, but my interest is mainly in the first 100 moves - particularly the timing/choice of my tenuki.

I seem to have done ok in the middle-game fighting (except for the obvious mistakes!)...]
;B[dd]C[hi my name is howard 
I'm a 5k player in America.];W[pq];B[dp];W[pd];B[qo]C[[CJT\] I was trying to keep the opening as simple as possible - but I know that a kakari is generally good here to prevent the shimari...]
;W[ql];B[oo]C[[CJT\] And running the centre here as R10 didn't seem like a severe enough counter-pincer.]
;W[np];B[no]TR[ql]C[[CJT\] Here I am aiming to build influence with which to attack the marked stone]
;W[mp];B[ln];W[kp]
(;B[iq]C[[CJT\] I think this was probably quite a weak move - my thoughts are in the variations

This is a decent move because it aims to weaken the lower part of white's territories.]
;W[jq]
(;B[ip]C[too good for black];W[nl]C[[CJT\] So W gets a chance to defend before I can attack - I should have used sente to attack this group?

My sugesstion  
depends on wheather on you want to fight or not 
I think this is fine, if you are too greedy and you pincer the stone white will attack that black stone.]

(;B[ll]C[white can still seperate the two group later on 
 this move is fine 

by the way white might die at the bottom later on will mbe treaten to make eyes]
;W[mi];B[dj]C[[CJT\] I played here since W was building a big moyo and had no weak groups - I felt I needed to try and secure more territory

that is fine];W[cn];B[co]TR[dj]C[[CJT\] Played 21 to prevent W taking the corner - only because marked stone was in place.]

(;W[cj]C[too far]
(;B[ci]C[[CJT\] Is 23 under 22 better - to try and separate W into two weak groups? 
this is fine but of course you can hane the other way which it gives you a bigger moyo but little territory at the left side.]
;W[bj];B[bi];W[en];B[fp];W[gn];B[in];W[dk];B[ej];W[ek]
(;B[fj]C[[CJT\] I felt happy to let W live here in return for thickness. Would 33 have been more forceful as a hane?

hane is better  white might die actually but i'm not strong enough to read that far ahead]
;W[fc];B[fd]LB[ec:a]C[[CJT\] If black A white 35, W seems to have a huge lead in potenetial territory - and I would need to invade/reduce both on the upper side and the right.

I thought that if I could let W live small on the top, while building central territory and influence, an invasion on the right would stand a better chance.

if that is white you want then pincer F17];W[jd]
(;B[ec]C[[CJT\] I think 37 to the right of 36 looks better

I think this is too slow];W[gc];B[gd];W[hd];B[he]
(;W[ie];B[hc];W[id];B[fb];W[gb];B[hb];W[ic];B[ib];W[jb];B[hf]
;W[ga];B[fa];W[hh];B[gh]
(;W[hg];B[gg];W[hj]C[big mistake];B[mj]TR[hf]C[[CJT\] I wanted to break through into W's territory using the weakness caused by the marked stone. I was trying to lean on W's moyo to give me a better chance of spitting white's two groups.


you should have invaded earlier];W[nj];B[li]
(;W[mk];B[lj];W[lk];B[kk];W[mh];B[lh];W[lg];B[kg];W[lf];B[if]
LB[gk:a]C[[CJT\] Now I tried to split the W groups - hoping I could then isolate the three marked stones with a move around A, and take the central territory...]
;W[jf];B[jg];W[ig];B[hi];W[ih];B[ii];W[ij]
(;B[qc]C[[CJT\] I didn't want to miss my chance of living in this corner, so I tenukied there now - was I missing a bigger move?]
;W[pb]C[[CJT\] I've never seen this move before in response to a 3-3 invasion - is it a common (good) move, or should I have done better in countering it? This sequence (to move 106) is one of the most interesting parts of this game to me - I think if I had played it well I could have destroyed much of W's large territory here.


its wrong move]

;B[ne];W[le]TR[pd][qd]C[[CJT\] This sequence should have easily given me a living group - all I had to be careful of was killing the two marked stones (or connecting and making life in the corner if necessary)

Unfortunately, I made some mistakes in this area...]
(;B[jh];W[og];B[of];W[pg];B[pf];W[qf];B[qg];W[ph];B[qe];W[rf]

(;B[qh]C[[CJT\] This was an overplay :o(];W[od];B[pi]TR[qo]
C[[CJT\] Now I was thinking that with the 8 stones lost, I could somehow connect to the marked stone and reduce W's territory that way    

no need to do that because you can't get much out of that stone]
;W[oh];B[oj];W[nk];B[re]C[[CJT\] This saved the corner at least...]
;W[pe];B[rd];W[oe];B[sc]C[[CJT\] But in gote];W[qi];B[ri];W[qj]
;B[qq]LB[rq:a]C[[CJT\] Would A have been better here? I think it would be gote though]

;B[pm];W[pl];B[bn]C[[CJT\] Now I wanted to put pressure on W's remaining weak group at this point the game seemed close. I thought I was behind, but now it looks like B was slightly ahead at this point...]

LB[gk:a]C[[CJT\] I could have perhaps played a better move here - A for example? I failed to realise that even if W captured at 155, I could keep the eye false with a throw-in...]

(;B[fk]C[too soft allow white to make an eye !!];W[fl];B[gl]
;W[gm];B[fn]LB[eo:a][go:b]C[[CJT\] Of course I needed a stone at either A or B to make this a false eye as I had hoped...

;W[ep]
(;B[fq]C[[CJT\] Here I was just trying to be careful - knowing that if I didn't slip up, the W group would have only one eye... 171 under 170 looks quite possible though]

(;W[ds];B[fr];W[er];B[cs];W[do];B[cp];W[bq]C[[CJT\] I go on to play some unnecessary moves in this sequence - but with a large lead hinging on the capture of the W group, I wasn't trying to take any risks!]
