C[I played black and lost on the Tom site as an 18 kyu. i lost in the last minute, and lost my lead and resigned, and one of the bad games i played. please give some tips, thanks!

< It was actually a close game, and the outcome wasn't clear until the end.

I'm only a few stones stronger than you are, so don't take my advices for more than they are. Just think about them and make your own opinion.

The variations I played are the ones I thought were the most obvious, but they were many other possibilities in each case. It's quite impossible to guess what would have happened in the actual game.>]

;W[po];B[mq]LB[np:A]C[<Playing A  puts more pressure on the white stone, and might give a bigger territory on the bottom, so it's probably better than N3>]

(;W[qf]C[fast pace by white

<I don't like this move. Now there are 4 lonely stones on the right side, 2 white and 2 black, and it's black turn. So white might and up with a stone under attack. I think it's better to help the Q5 stone first.>]

;W[ce];B[cf]C[should i have continued attacking the bottom right white group?

i knew losing that much stones, and with the weakness at J16 will bring me even farther behind. i played a crap game, i guess i need more practice with the chinese opening and endgame fixings.
please give me some help. thanks!

< About the fuseki, when you have sente and want to tenuki, you should look at the whole board to spot the weakest groups.
Then, you should play to strenghen your weak groups and to attack your opponents weak ones. You'll make territory this way.

About the endgame, you should try to guess how many points a move will get you before playing it. Not playing 1 point gote move might be the easiest and fastest way for you to improve in a short amount of time.>]
