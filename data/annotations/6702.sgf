C[dbstraight [14k\]: gg

I'm dbstraight, playing black. This game was played on KGS. My opponent was ranked 8k.

unc: Hey dbstraight, I'm unc, 7k on KGS. White in this game made a lot of unreasonable invasions and tenukis and created many weak groups, probably hoping you would be unable to deal with them properly. Don't worry if you can't grasp some of the concepts here -- some of them are tricky to deal with.]

;W[df];B[jc]C[This is joseki, right?

unc: This is actually an overplay by white. This way of playing is good when there's another white stone on K16 because it cramps black's group, but otherwise it just lets black extend one more space comfortably, so you're fine here :). In addition, black can still invade the corner at 3-3 as a big yose point (see variation)]

(;W[cj];B[pj]C[So far, things seem pretty even.];W[oc];B[mc]
C[The pincer seemed especially good here with the stone at K17.

unc: This way of playing is okay, the other usual move at Q15 (Shusaku's kosumi) is good too because it builds up your moyo on the right side.]
;W[jq]
(;B[nq]C[Too passive?

unc: O3 is a big point, but there are bigger areas on the board. White has just tenukied after approaching at P17, so the first thought is for black to punish white's premature tenuki (see variation). In addition, white is building a large moyo on the bottom left corner with a double-wing formation from D4. Compared to K3, O3 is a much smaller point, so black might want to play more actively by invading white's moyo (see other variation).]
;W[qn];B[qo]C[My idea was to complete my corner and respond to the approaching stone.]
;W[pn];B[ql]C[Trying to pressure the white stones. I should've protected the corner, based on what happened next.

unc: This way of playing looks okay. Adding a move to the corner would make it overconcentrated.]
;W[qq]C[Should I have been able to kill this?

unc: Hard to say, but either R3 or R6 will die; black is content either way. S5 is the proper move.]
;B[ro];W[rp]
(;B[pq];W[pr];B[or];W[rr]
(;B[no]C[unc: O5 neither makes territory nor defends any cutting points. Better to attack at Q17 or reduce at K5 now. White can also treat his two stones lightly now that he has gotten compensation in the corner.]
;W[qp];B[po];W[ps];B[on];W[qb]TR[pn][qn]C[White managed to live in the corner, but the marked stones seem very weak, and my position still looks ok to me at this point.

unc: Black is overconcentrated in the lower right corner, while white is treating his stones lightly. White has profited from this sequence.]
;B[rc]C[I wasn't sure if I should do this or not. White seemed to be playing the joseki in a different order.

unc: This way is okay. P15 is also good for building up your moyo on the right side, allowing white to live small in the corner. Building up your moyo is worth more than the corner at this point.]
;W[qg]C[Presumably, white was counting on my response there to be able to make this invasion.]
;B[pc]C[It seemed by forcing white to defend here, I could also build up a strong position from which to attack the invasion.

unc: White's invasion here was unreasonable to begin with. A splitting attack is the right idea here as white has 2 weak groups. Q17 is a bit slow though, better to jump out directly, maybe arond Q14.]

(;B[pd]C[My position seems really strong here, and the invading stone is starting to look vulnerable to me, but it lives anyway. Did I do something wrong or am I reading this wrong?

unc: Crawling on the second line to live is always painful, as black's wall is looming over the right side now and white has gained maybe 10 points from that sequence. M18 is also sente against the corner (white should crawl once more). R13 should not be able to live.]

It's over by this point, but there were so few moves left, I just wanted to play it out. I think my opponent wanted me to resign here, which would've been fine, but it seems to help me to know how MUCH I'm losing by.]

dbstraight [14k\]: thank you for the game

I lost this game by a much larger margin than was warranted given our ratings. White made some really good moves in the opening, that I just didn't know what to do with, and I didn't know how to make any similar moves on his side of the board. That left me in a basically lost position after not too many moves. What could I have done in the opening to put myself in a better position for later?]
