(;W[fb]C[b: This move is not so good. You get very low and your oponent gets to much influence towards the center. If you want to avoid the taicha E17 is better.]
;B[dd];W[cc];B[ec];W[eb];B[ck];W[pq];B[cn]
(;W[cp]C[b: This move is not so good. If black attacks from somewhere around F3 your position in the corner becomes very small and black gets strength everywhere on the outside. Black can attack from F3 (now or later) as his stone C4 is strong. the white move is possible, if black does not have a stone on C9.]
;B[qo];W[oo];B[qq];W[qr];B[pp];W[oq];B[op];W[rq];B[qp];W[nq]
;B[np];W[pk]C[b: No! White must play at N4! If black plays N3, its very painful for white! You are lucky that black didnt play N3!]
(;B[qi];W[qf];B[qk]
(;W[nc]C[b: not good! You already have got a weak stone at R14. This will weaken this stone further. You are producing a weak group at R14]
;B[oe];W[ph];B[qh];W[pf];B[qc];W[kc]
(;B[of]C[b: Black doe not know, how to attack your stones. This move only helps you.]
;W[og];B[pj];W[oj];B[ok];W[pi];B[pl];W[nj];B[le];W[fc]C[b: Try to avoid this move.  If you want to play J17, play it without that exchange. You can come back to this move F17 at any time. Not playing it leaves other options for later (e.g. E15).]
;B[ed];W[ic];B[hd]C[Blacks position is much better, Black dominates the board and even has terrotory on the right side. White has not much in exchange.]
;W[hc];B[ml];W[eh]C[b: you are producing another weak group. But with blacks strength all around it is hard to find a good move here.]
;B[ch];W[ek];B[ei]C[b: Ouch! Black helps white. Black does not know how to attack. Attaching the stone strengthens whites weak stone. After this move white can come back into the game.]
;W[di]C[b: good move!];B[dh];W[fi]C[b: excelent! All blacks influence vanishes!]
;B[lq]C[b: bad ladder breaker! The move N3 hurts much more!]
;W[ej]C[b: very good!];B[ci];W[id]C[b: This move is not necessary any more. Blacks wall is neutralized with the ponuki. What do you want to achieve? Answer the ladder breaker  with N2, or play F3.]
;B[rp];W[sq];B[sp];W[rr];B[mq]C[b: Here one can see, how bad the move M3 was: N3 was a good move all by itself. The move M3 is now a little bit wasted.]
;W[nr];B[fq]C[b: Good move!];W[eq];B[fp];W[hp]C[b: Very strange move. Not good! You are producing a weak group again!]

;B[fo];W[gn]C[b: again black is helping white to get shape. Black F5 accomplishes nothing white G6 is good for whites shape.]
;B[eg];W[fg];B[ef];W[kj]C[b: Very good. Now I would prefer playing white. I think I stop the comments here, as you were mainly interested in Fuseki.]
