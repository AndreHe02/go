C[I (Golo) am white and played as 14k.
My preferred languages are English or German.
Thank you for reviewing the game!

vlkplk: I`ll try my best :)];B[dd];W[pq];B[cq];W[pc];B[kc];W[pe]
C[vlkplk: I like this closure of white`s corner. White shall just keep on mind, that at least one more move, say around R13 or R12, is needed to make upper right corner into territory.]
;B[dh];W[ep]C[vlkplk: Again, this W e4 seems good move. Ofcourse, it`s a joseki pattern, but I don`t remember such difficult one. I usualy play simply at 4-4 point in this situation.]
;B[cc]C[vlkplk: This is very conservative move from black. Next, white has a chance to close black in lower left corner with move like C5.]

(;W[jp]C[I've read some stuff about opening technique but still feel quite unsure if I am using it well

The one-point-jump (4-6) is probably too short?

Should I rather pincer black 3 with  10?

vlkplk: I`m not keen in josekis at all. I believe, that on ours level we don`t need to remeber them point by point, just enough to keep some basic rules. As for something joseki-like, it would be nice to confine black in the corner with W C5 instead. 

White K4 is not bad, but 1) too far from either of white stones on lower side, 2) being on 4th line, it doesn`t secure any territory (as would be seen later) and 3)too from Q3 stone to be considered as a corner closure. It`s anyway a move to keep influence.]

(;B[do]C[vlkplk: Very natural answer from black. White can next play in lower right corner. Notice, that white`s two stones at E4 and K4 are quite far of each other and so not very connected. Consequently, white cannot safely jump into black`s left side moyo in this stage of game. That`s why I didn`t like W K4.]
;W[eo];B[dn];W[dp]C[vlkplk: W D4 is sente, but not necessary now. Generally, I think, it`s a kind of move which kills any other possibilities in the corner (aji-keshi).]
;B[cp]
(;W[hd]C[Here I played tenuki and regretted in later (109)

vlkplk: Yes, that`s right. White`s shape in lower left is not completed. On the other hand, it would be no good to push further, since black is on 4th line. The best move would be W F7, I think.

As for W H16, it`s hard to say. 1) it`s on 4th line - no life 2) it makes an easy attack from black, like for ex. B K15.]

(;B[hc]C[16 on the 3rd line better?

vlkplk: Definitely not, since there would be very small life for white. Black`s corner is already strong, so it would be hard to for white to approach ther.]
;W[gc];B[pj]C[vlkplk: Strange from black to tenuki on upper side.]

(;W[ic]C[vlkplk: Somehow, I don`t like this atari. Ofcourse it`s good idea to isolate B L17. How about variation? It strengthten white in upper side, preparing for an attack on black Q10.]
;B[hb];W[ib];B[gb]
(;W[fd];B[fc]C[vlkplk: Better bF18. This one helps white to connect at G16 (aji-keshi). Later it might come in hand for black to play G15 in sente..]
;W[gd];B[ec];W[jd]
(;B[pn]C[vlkplk: Quite non-standard move. Why not R5 or, Q5? It 1)doesn`t connect with B Q10 well, 2)seeing as a pincer, it could be nearer to W Q3.]
;W[qo];B[pl]C[black plays very condensed here. Which is the best way to gain profit from that mistake (if it is one ;-) )

vlkplk: Well, it`s not a mistake, just a lost move. It only keeps black connected and nothing else.  The problem was already in 3-point jump along the 4th line. 3-point jump is said to be safe on the 3rd line, be there some alied stone alongside. But on the 4th line it`s rather loose way of connection.]
;W[qh];B[nk]
(;W[oh];B[nm]
(;W[mp]C[What is more advisable at this stage of the game. Playing like I did or removing/attacking blacks base on the right side?

vlkplk: Blacks last two moves were of very little efficiency. On the other hand, blacks group is so strong, that it cannot be attacked directly. The best course for white, which he did anyway, would be to secure his lower side territory. Maybe, instead of W N4, N3 would be better. As it is now, black can invade somwhere, like at P3 or O3.]

(;B[dl]
(;W[df]C[vlkplk: Good idea from white. Another possibility would be deep invasion at around C10.]
;B[cf]C[At the end black will have the whole left side as territory. When would have been the best occasion for an invasion?

vlkplk: White should definitely split the upper black group from lower side and escape to center, having his stones around G16 as back-up. Simply pushing black was not enough, since black gained quite a huge territory along left side.]

(;W[ee]C[vlkplk: Well, this white move was a little bit sluggish one. White shouldn`t fear so much and try something like the cut at C13 or C15. Black stone at D12 is on the 4th line, so white either escapes to the center or lives along the side.]
;B[de]C[vlkplk: Still, white`s aim must be to invade left side, on whatever cost. D10 or C10 would be fine now. D14 stone is of not so much importance, so white can sacrifice it.]

(;W[ef];B[dg]
(;W[eg];B[di]C[vlkplk: B E11, E10 or F11 would be better. Maybe, white could omit F11 and play M15, but than black can almost cancell the influence of white`s central group.]

(;W[fi]C[46: Good or bad move?

vlkplk: W F11 is nice move. White would like to have one more stone at F8 as well. Just black`s gain along left side is big. So next, white wants to play either F8 (I would) or try something for territory in the center. Like M15, which threatens B L17.]
;B[le]C[Maybe with 46 I should rather have prevented b from separating my two groups? But how?

vlkplk: Too late now, but well, white must take off black`s base, which white did, and then don`t allow black connect his stones. At the right moment, white must play something like N12, M12 or M13.]
;W[mc];B[kd]
(;W[ld];B[kf]C[vlkplk: After W M16 and B L4, black is safe as he can either make eyes or connect his stones. For white, I would still consider L12, now.]

(;W[kb]C[vlkplk: This white`s L18 is minor move. Black can descend anyway and white can`t get much points there. More important now is incomming fight in the center.]
;B[kh]C[vlkplk: Well, now black is 100% safe. Ofcourse, white has nice upper right corner and surrounding...]
;W[je];B[ke];W[mi]C[vlkplk: Finally! But it`s too late now. Black has too many options what to do with his a bit heavy, though, group.]
;B[mh];W[ni]
(;B[md]C[vlkplk: Here, white was maybe happy with that black`s choice. Black could separate white central group from corner.]
;W[lc];B[nd];W[nc];B[oe];W[od];B[nf];W[of];B[ne]
(;W[ki]C[vlkplk: Contact moves, like this W L11, generally are used to create cutting points and as such are not suitable for attack (but good for defense :).]
;B[og]C[In the end the black group will live and I don't know how to avoid that :-(

vlkplk: Black was already well enough out in the center and there was black`s group of 5 stones as backup. So it was unavoidable that black would survive. Anyway, white got enough territory in the corner and connected his stones, which was reasonable result.]
;W[pf];B[nh];W[pg];B[ng];W[oi];B[jf];W[if]C[vlkplk: Black`s 75th move at K14 seems vital for life of this group (or at least avoids some disturbing moves from white.) On the other hand, starting with white`s 76, white has not much to fear from there, so he could pause in the center and play at some really important place. Like D2, M7, F6 or anything which seems big. Center is big, ofcourse, but there are still bigger points on the board.]
;B[jh];W[ji];B[ig];W[hf];B[ii];W[ij];B[hi];W[ej];B[dj];W[gj]
;B[gi];W[fh];B[hg];W[gg];B[gh];W[gf]C[vlkplk: For example W 92 was absolutely unnecessary move. But same could be said for each other move in the sequence from W 76 until W 92, except, ofcourse, the moves which enclose black group in the center. But there is a hole (as a result of contact play by white...)]

(;B[jc];W[jb]C[vlkplk: Ofcourse here, white`s connection was essential.]
;B[en]
(;W[fn]C[vlkplk: White`s 96 was too dangerous, since there is cutting point while black is stoned. Better G5 or G4. D2 might be also good, but there is danger of black`s invasion.]
;B[fm];W[gn];B[qn]
(;W[qj]C[vlkplk: Again, white`s R10 - a contact move. I don`t say it was bad in this situation, but generally non-contact play is better for attack. Anyway, black is still strong and it would be hard to take out all his possible eyes.]
;B[qk];W[rj];B[rk]
(;W[rn]C[vlkplk: White`s S6 - dtto.];B[rm];W[so]C[vlkplk: White ends in a gote! Toward the end of game, the sente/gote choice gets more importance, as a value of free points on the board diminishes.]
;B[sm]C[vlkplk: Again, now it`s black who gives up initiative to white here.]
;W[hl];B[fr]C[I always knew this move had to come, but never found the time to secure the territory before.
Which would have been the best move to prevent this invasion?

vlkplk: D2 would do. But other moves helped this black`s invasion. White 96, 98 didn`t prevent completely the cutting point at F5. But basicaly, the problem was that 3 white`s WEAK stones and they were sitting there from beginning...]

(;W[er]C[vlkplk: Good idea, but maybe F3 would make better shape.]

(;B[jr]C[vlkplk: Strange move from black. Quite dangerous. I liked white`s continuation (until that mistake...)]
;W[fq];B[gr];W[hq];B[hr];W[iq];B[ir]
(;W[kr]C[vlkplk: Was this a misclick from white? L3 would do it as well.]

(;W[ls]C[128: A shocking mistake! Which would have been the best possible 128 move?

;B[oj];W[ml]C[vlkplk: Black has missed this point! So white could get nice central territory. Should black played there first, white`s center would have become very small.]

C[vlkplk: Just small endgame mistake by white. See variation.]

;B[gm];W[hm];B[bl]C[vlkplk: Any move inside black`s left territory was -1 point for black (we are not using Chinese rules...)]
;W[gl];B[em];W[ei];B[es]C[165: I never thought that 165 would do any harm to me at this stage, so I didn't play there myself. Was I right?

vlkplk: Well, if white plays there, it would be 1 point in sente. On the other hand, there is that terrible sequence as in variation, which result I myself couldn`t foresee, so almost I would connect at G3.]

In the end I won luckily with 3,5. Probably just because of all the extra-stones black put into his territory to secure his territory on the left.

I will be grateful for any general advice you could give me to improve my playing.
Thanks in advance!

vlkplk: During engame both white and black did some mistakes. But endgame is very difficult, so I didn`t make comments, except some obvious one.]
