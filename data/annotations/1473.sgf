C[Hi!

Thanks for reviewing the game.

I played B and had a really bad time here.  One particular weakness of my game that shows up here very clearly is that I rarely know how to deal with "strange" moves by my opponents.  In this case, it's mostly the opening few moves that threw me and made it hard for me to recover (psychologically speaking), so that I totally followed my opponent around into the middle game and never quite gained initiative afterward.  I couldn't seem to change the tempo of the game.  So, please focus on the early part of the game and comment on where B could've better dealt with W's "power" (however crude) moves.

Best,
Ken];B[pd];W[jj];B[cd];W[pj];B[dp]C[Better at K16 or LR corner?

tasita:
Not bad. Winning or losing doesn't depends that for ama player.]
;W[jd];B[ec]C[Should have played the last corner?

tasita:
That's ok.];W[nc];B[qf];W[pp];B[qn]C[I guess this was the wrong side.  O4 was out of the question for me because I was sure W'd play the tsuke joseki.  Maybe O4 is a possibility?  Or K4?  Or C10 first, and after W plays K4, invade at R3?    Should've been more thoughtful.  But just the presence of W K10 made me too nervous, I guess.

tasita:
Since w had moved K10,Q4,Q10, K4 around is urgent
place to move now. Of course, O4,O3 both OK. Here what you should know is that right direction is bottom side, not right side.

tasita's conclusion for openning game:
When I read first 11 moves(till R6), I understand what you said at the beginning of this game. You hope to know how to deal with those strange, unknown, seems to be not good, MOVES. OK, pls let me to do something to introduce a new GO concept to you.

Firstly, Till now, White' moves are not bad moves.It is just a choice. Go is a freedom game. You can move what you like. Of course, when we were learning Go from teachers, they told us that some moves are better and some are not good. However, there are too many variables in Go World. For us, ama players, not professional players, we play Go for fun. Why not try all kinds of moves that you think reasonable? Just do it. Throught practising your idea in game, you will get response of your moves. Maybe it is good, then just move in later games. Otherwise, if it is not good, to find why and improve your move. Following this way, you will find that you won't be afraid of the unknown and strange moves because you know why you move at this point and how to beat back when others play some strange moves. All in one word, Learns from Books&Teachers, But Moves what you think it is right. This is some kinda Go concept. If you like, you may follow this concept to play. Hope to help you improving your go skill.

Secondly,
From white's moves, we know that white pay more attention to middle of board. White think Middle is more important and that's a better way leading to winning. We just need know this. That's ok. From your moves, Black plays tradtional moves. Pay more attention to corner and territory. Not bad, it is just a selection. We cant make sure which it better.
So, Black D4,E17,R14 all ok. What shouldn't be ignored is that K4 and Q4. You should get at least one. You see, if two good points was got by White, that is nightware. So If White move K4, you should move Q4 to prevent that happens, Vice verse, you could move K4 around now, not R6. Ok,let's describe some new concept in next paragraph.

Thirdly,
From your words, I guess you are confident in your middle game and not so satisified with your openning game. yes, it is a classification of Go game. I have another Go game classification style. From my own aspect, I classify a go game moves into two classes.
One is the detail move, and the others is the direction move. When playing middle game, we foucs more on the detail moves. It often dicides life or death, cut or link etc. when openning game, we pay more attention to direction move. For example, your R6 moves wrong direction. what is right direction?
K4 around place. K4 is the best place, you said it.
Otherwise, L4,J4,K3 are all right direction. Of course, K4 is better. But, firly you should find right direction, and then try to find the best way. The right direction is more important in Go game. Improving your skill in detail move is easy. Improving direction decision is some difficult.

I have said so many things. Maybe you are tired of my crackle. Pls permit me to do a simple conclusion:

I, Learns from Books&Teachers, But Moves what you think it is right and Improves by your practical game.

II,Firstly Try to move at right direction, and then try to find the best point at right direction.]

;B[ml];W[rm];B[rn];W[ro];B[qm]C[Not unhappy about this sequence, since it helped B to settle down.

tasita;
Ok, a battle ending. We take a look at it.
You said" Not Unhappy...." Now we change our aspect. When it helped B to settle down, whether we can think Black are helping White to build territory and thickness group?!

In Go world, there are some keys that is like the axiom and theorem in our world. One of the most important keys is the relation of thickness and weakness. You game is showing us what thickness group is and what weakness group is.
M3 is weakness group.
N5 group is thickness group.
P11 group is thickness group.
R14 group is weakness group.
R7 group is thickness group but NOT useful.
Why say so? Here is explaination.
M3 is weakness group relative to thickness group N5. This thickness affect M3's life and promise that right-bottom corner is white's territory.
According same reason, R14 group is weakness group relative to P11 group. So if white move R17, black will lose basement and in danger.
R7 group is thick, correct! But NOT useful. This group is closed by white and can't affect outside. It can't help M3 group or any other groups. Just protect its limited territory. Only 11 points.

Our conclusion is that pay attention thickness and weakness when playing. Thickness group will affect very much and sometimes make weakness group in danger.]
;W[jp]C[tasita:
Look, now you can find the power of thickness. M3 group is in danger.]
;B[fq]C[Better to play K2 or K3?

tasita:
From direction aspect, F3 is not bad. Another good direction is Q18 to ensure your corner and make R14 group thick and safe.  From detail aspect, G3 is better than F3 because you may move K2 after G3.

Now let's make an analysis of moving K3 directly. It is not good. Why? Ok, Not considering your group life or death after K2 or K3. For making live, white must get more thicker at G3 around. after that, W will move D6 or C6 to attack D5. At that time your D5 becomes weakness group. Otherwise, white is easy to get territory in middle(H7,H8 around). so K3 is not good. Let's change aspect, your R6 is not so good move. White does attack to that stone. Your group makes alive and get 11 points. Where is the white's gift? Yes, right-bottom corner and attacking M3 or getting R17. It is penalty. No way to escape:(
So moving right direction is important. R11 is at wrong direction.]
;W[hq];B[nr]C[tasita:
The urgent point is Q18. White H3 is not so good.
K3 is better. Now black has chance to make alive,
but it is not time to do that. Just move those big place and come back to do that.]
;W[oq];B[or];W[pr];B[jr]C[tasita:
after K2,black is already alive.];W[kq];B[kr];W[mq];B[hr];W[gr]
C[tasita:
W G2 is not useful.just M2 is ok. This is calculation. After calculation, black is alive, why to move G2, of course M2 to cut black to get a dragon tail.:)]
;B[iq];W[gq];B[ip];W[lp]C[tasita:
What a pity! because J4, white cant move M2 now.];B[lr]C[Too slow.  F4 or G5 better?

tasita:
......en...i think not slow. M55 is worth 14 points. G3 group is not thickness. so dont worry.]
;W[hs]C[Then W plays a slow move, too....];B[jq];W[kp];B[ho]
C[tasita:
why K3, directly H5 is ok.];W[fp];B[eq]C[Would something like F5 be better?

tasita:
No, E3 is good job. Dont let white H3 group easily live.];W[go]
;B[hn]C[tasita:
Could G6,dont worry white move H6. You could kill G3 group. It is a simple life&death problem.

At this kinda place, detail moves is more important.
Dont think direction much. It is time of life or death. The calculation is the most useful skill.]

;W[cn];B[cq]C[Simply B4?  A little worried about G2 sticking out there.

tasita:
B4 or C4 is ok. Here right direction is making live.
you did at right direction. That's enough. Maybe C4 works well, But C3 is safety. That's ok. Just move what you have known. You know C3 can make live and not sure whether B4 could or not. Then Move C3. For me, maybe i will move D6 to cut white stones into two parts for attacking G4 group.]
;W[gk];B[kj]C[tasita:
H10 better, H5 group wont die.];W[hj];B[di]C[Where should this move've been?  D11 turned out not so good.  Played it on the fourth line to counter W thickness.  And was worried about the left side turning into too much W territory.  There didn't seem to be any point in trying to play something like M17, given W thickness.  Perhaps H17 would be a good alternative?

tasita:
D11 is right direction. not bad. Ha, you know it counter W thickness. ok, since you think so, move far away from white thickness. E.g. D12,C12.Anyway, it is right direction.]
;W[ik];B[jl];W[cg]C[Shock.  Totally at a loss.  In retrospect, had B75 been at B4 instead, would have the easy option of playing at C8 now.  But no....

tasita:
hehe,now C8 is still good point. there is D6 after that.];B[ch]
C[Was hoping for W D13, B C8.];W[bd]C[And of course W wasn't so cooperative....  What next for B?  The actual move wasn't all that good....

tasita:
ok,let's make an analysis for direction.
your D11 group is weak. so you must make white's C13 group weak too. Then you will not be worried. so the right direction is that dont allow white to get corner and push it outside. so C17 or B17 is right direction.]

tasita:
i dont think it is necessary.
For J line, White must move one stone to eliminate your eye. so you could move F17 or others to make alive. if White move at F17,D18 around. You move H12, then you have one eye at J line.]

(;B[pl]N[common variable];W[qk];B[mm];W[lo];B[km]C[tasita:
Here is a common variable.Unlucky white is better. But is is because of R11. After moving R11, we can't hope some variable to make black leading.:(

Note:Pls attention, sometimes I say white or black is better. It is just some better,for example 5-7 points better or grasping initiative. You see, for a ama player, generally it doesn't dicide win or lose in so early stage.]
