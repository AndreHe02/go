C[In this game I was playing with a somewhat weaker player. We both made mistakes and in the end I was losing about 15 pts. Only a miracle allowed me to win, but of course it is much better to win by knowledge.

I would like to receive a general review of this game, especially from the strategic point of view - and in the midgame.

Thank you very much in advance.

first, you did not win 
counting you will see that white has about 59 unoccupied poionts of territory and black has 111.
i see thought that this was a 25 min game, so if blacks time lapsed then you did in fact win.
ON the general view, at this leave and all the way up to at least SHODAN time does not really matter, what does matter is learning to count and what is KO and how to fight them.
the bedrock of this game is KO fighting for in fighting KO's you have to know what the score is.
there is a saying that i learned early on:
A RICH MAN DOES NOT NEED TO FIGHT
In this game all you need to win is one 1/2 of a point.
if you are behind in the count then you look to begin a KO fight.]

;B[sn]C[you cared more about two points that ten to thirty.
connecting at 72 is a yose move 
look at playing at Q10 or even at R15
the idea here is to counter the power of black 63-71, and how to do so is use all of your power ie. all the white stones along the fourth line.
you should be able to place a move 72 at K15 and connet it to the fourth line.
that is a lot of power that the white stones have in the upward direction.]

black has two weak groups the 63-71 and the 73-75 black stones v. whites stronge 74-86 and 32-70 stones.]

(;B[om];W[nm];B[ol]C[what you did was make black stronger which in the end allowed him to get the big moyo which let him get the that huge 111 points
i would suggest to you, to begin to understand the power of stones and the direction the power flowes]

[pf][pp]C[first and formost, you did not win..
your white groupe between k and t -12 and 16 have no eyes.
if you  count you will see that just with the unoccupied points on the board whit hase about 59 point territory and black has 111 point territory.
i see that it was a 25min game and if blacks time lapsed then it would be true that you did win, and as i see it then is you where counting on black runing out of time.
this being true, you do a disservce to the game and only care about winning.
the bedrock meaning of this game is to learn to win by 1/2 point.
in order to do so you have to learn ko's and the first step there is to learn to count.
i could spend days on telling you about counting, but no time.
so in answer to the over all game you have mastered it, ie. just have one second of time more than you opponent.
White wins by 7.5 points.])
