C[Dear reviewer, I really didn't understand how this game went so wrong. So I would appreciate it very much if you pointed out my major mistakes.
I think that what's causing me the most trouble currently is the direction of play, when to stop attacking and take cash, and how to lead an attack generally speaking.
Thank you very much for your time.

Hello, Astralth, 

I am Bernd, HonFu here in the GTL, on KGS and in other go places. Happy to review your game! 

So let's see what we got here ...];B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dq];B[do]
;W[fp]
(;B[dl]
(;W[jq]LB[iq:A]C[I frequently make those three points keima and frequently get cut, I read they where good. Are they? When to use them?

Hon: Seen from the point of direction this move is alright since it prevents a development of the black hoshi stone (hoshi stones want to have at least one of the side points, better two).

The extension to K3 is not a good move for the reason you will definitely keep the territory. Sometimes the opponent invades and you go for outside influence instead, or start to attack the stone. Taking solid territory by any means is not the purpose of K3 - it's a flexible move. In cases where you need to control the territory, you would play on A instead.]
;B[hq]C[Hon: This invasion is unreasonable without a move at m3 first to support it. But punishing it is not always easy.]
;W[gq];B[hp]LB[fn:A][mq:B]C[Hon: It's important to get out with your stones. Your corner group is threatened with confinement while the stone at k3 still has two directions to move.

I'd recommend either A or B.]
(;W[jo]LB[mq:A]C[Hon: If you play on this side, I would rather suggest A, to make a base, since you still can.]
;B[hn];W[np]C[I'm also having a lot of difficulties deciding how to approach the San San. High, up, one two or three points?

Hon: In most cases the low approach is correct, because all the other approaches often result in losing the option of invading the corner. For details look at a joseki page like www.eidogo.com.]
;B[fd]C[Hon: Good - we get an opportunity to look at one major variation. :-)]
(;W[hc]C[Hon: As a rule of thumb, when there is a strong enemy stone like Q16 in the other corner, playing a pincer, though not impossible, should not be the first idea, because the pincer stone might end up getting attacked harder than the stone you are pincering now.]
;B[ff];W[df];B[kc]
(;W[kd]C[I wanted to try leaning on that stone but it didn't go well. Was I wrong in leaning or in the process of doing it ?

Hon: Leaning is a strategy you employ to build up influence against another enemy weak group. Normally you lean on stones which are already quite solid and can't be attacked any longer anyways. In this case you help black strengthen his wide position at the top - that is one reason why it is not good. Another is, that you are not in a position right now to attack the F16 group really hard, since D8-stone is there for black's aid. For a third - very important - reason see variation.]
;B[jd];W[jc]C[Hon: Good. If you play here, then it has to be the cross cut.]
;B[ic]
(;W[id]C[Hon: This is bad.];B[jb]C[Hon: You must not grant your opponent a ponnuki without need!]
;W[je];B[jc];W[ge]C[Here I tried to make a light connection, saw it in a book, but maybe the two black stones on the left make it unusable ?

Hon: The problem is, that your stones don't really work together. You are attacking black from your weakish group, and you have this weakish group because you strenghened black on the top for no reason and even more than was necessary.]
;B[hd]
(;W[gd];B[ie];W[fc]C[Hon: Now the sabaki-sequence helped you to connect - which you could have had without giving black here anything at all!]
(;B[hb];W[gc]
(;B[jf]C[Anyway, up to here, I don't feel like I'm getting too bad a result ... Am I ?

Hon: Black got quite strong in this area. It was not necessary to play k14 now though.]
(;W[qp]C[And I think this is my major mistake : this second move in the corner made me struggle a lot after. I wanted to reduce his right side, but maybe I shouldn't have started attacking from a weak group ?

Hon: This is not good. Attaching is a move for making sabaki, you play it when you are weak in a sector, for example while invading a moyo. In this sector you are stronger, so there is no need to play this kind of defensive move.

If you approach a corner stone and your opponent tenukies ...]
;B[qq];W[po];B[pq];W[qo];B[pk]
(;W[rq];B[rr];W[oq]C[Hon: This is too weak shape. Black has so many weak points to aim at, what did you want to accomplish?]
;B[rp];W[pr];B[qr];W[ro];B[sq]C[Hon: Now you still need to defend your shape and can not really attack him.]
;W[pi]C[I thought my stones where strong enough to attack from but I must have been wrong, knowing what followed. Still I feel that just extending from it make me overconcentrated.

Hon: Yes, extending here would feel bad. The problem was the sequence before which wasn't really successful. You must not choose sequences that leave you with major weak points like P5.]
(;B[nk]C[Hon: Patient and good, aiming at attacking you on both sides.]
;W[qf]C[Hon: If black wants to attack now, he should go for it and not hesitate.]
(;B[qe];W[ol]C[Hon: Good timing.];B[oo]
(;W[op];B[ok]
(;W[on]C[Hon: Here you missed a good opportunity.];B[no]C[Now I'm struggling with two weak groups and I think that lost the game.]

;W[ql];B[qk];W[rm];B[rl];W[pl];B[pf]C[Hon: Ouch!

Having him first giving you small gote life, then getting this move is cruel against white.]
;W[rj];B[rk];W[ml]
(;B[mm]C[Hon: Pointless thank-you move.];W[nl];B[jn]C[Hon: Black's moves were a bit awkward here, inviting you to split him. Not really necessary.]

;B[lj];W[mn];B[ln];W[nm];B[kj]C[Hon: But if he has to take gote, then it feels like a pity to give you next move from your weak group, and he should have rather played there first.]
;W[of]C[This group didn't make it ... Was there a way to life ?

Hon: This move is a good start.

But of course this is troublesome, it's because of your leaving weakness behind earlier.]
;B[pe]
(;W[me]C[Hon: Do you want to live, or to take away all his points and die everywhere in the process? This move looks very all or nothing. You can only play it if you have thought long and well.]

(;B[lh];W[rh];B[sf];W[rc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rd];W[rb]C[Hon: At least you got the corner in exchange for the group, more than was to expect. 

In this whole fight you seemed to want to do everything at the same time - live, destroy the upper side, even invade the corner ...

When you have terribly weak shape like you had, it is time to look for a way to live, and nothing more.]
;B[ci]C[That was huge, I should have managed to get it.

Hon: No way. When you have a weak group, you get gote, its a principle of life. :-)]

Thanks a lot !];W[el];B[fk];W[ek]
(;B[dk];W[dj];B[fj];W[cj];B[ej]
(;W[fo]C[Hon: Too stingy.];B[di]C[Hon: Okay, this review ends here.

The problem in this game mainly seems to have been the question - when am I supposed to do what?

You tried a leaning attack on the upper side which only helped him getting stronger, because it was no situation where you could hope much of a lean. 

In the lower right you went for a sabaki move although you were not weak there at all. Black played a bit passively and almost you got a good result.

Then, in all fighting, the solidity of shape is an important factor. In the sequence in the lower right you were left with such a terrible weakness that your invasion on the right side ended up as a deadly overplay. On the other hand on the top side you gave him so many ponnukis that it was hard for black NOT to kill anything in the course of the game.

I can recommend a good book to get a feeling for reasonable attacking sequences:

Michael Redmond's "ABC of Attack and Defence".

Also James Davies' "Attack and Defence" is a very good book.]

Black's omission of a move in the corner lets you play on "both sides" of the corner stone, which is a positive value in joseki science.
