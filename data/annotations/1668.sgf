hi, I´m Jorge, here black, well, here felt i was slightly down, but later i lost an entire group but anyway, i would like your advices mainly about strategic issues, but of course, you are the master ;-)


Dear Jorge,

Both you and your opponent make a few misstakes,
I have tried to point out the ones that I found
and suggest better alternatives. But please keep
in mind that I'm not an expert.

On the strategic level I think you may have
underestimated the value of keeping your stones
connected and your opponents stones separated.

My first indication of this is move 7 at f5
which should be e6 to prevent the connection.

Move 13 at c14 is the second indication. True,  it does split white into two, but it is too weak.
I don't think it is good to play into a pincer
while there are still big extensions left.

Then there is of course also the problem of
identifying the important stones. This leads to
the sequence following 69. Especially move 75 was
very bad.

Good luck with your go game!
