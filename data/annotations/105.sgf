(;B[ce];W[be];B[de];W[bg];B[eg]M[bd]L[bd][cc][ae]C[in the standard pattern (when the  marked stone is not played), one usually plays 'b' in sente before this. but  here you can play 'a' too 'c' is a nice follow up, 'a' is very big!]

;W[qo];B[rp]L[ro]C[usually take the  stone, for 'a' is no sente for white]
;W[np]L[nq][ro]C['a' is  better shape, but 'b' in sente should be played first]
;B[oo]L[ro]C[why? i think first you should play 'a' yourself. by the way  saving this stone doesn't seem very interesting to me, since white's group  around are quite solid already.]
