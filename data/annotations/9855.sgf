C[White lost because he did not consistently attack B's weak groups. In particular, the weak B group on the right was allowed to connect to the upper right corner (and with ponnuki!). The potential White strongholds were robbed, and B's upper left corner remained intact. In the endgame B was too lenient, allowing W to make up and reach an almost equal result -- an 8.5 B win without komi is, after all, quite balanced.
