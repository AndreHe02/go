L[pi][pj]C[Rob- I  feel that this move should be at least q11 (a), and should probably be q10  (b). q12 is not a bad move, but it is too slow.]
;W[cn]L[ep]C[Rob- This is a strange approach for w. I'd prefer the normal  e4 (a).]
;B[do];W[dn];B[en];W[em];B[fn]C[Rob- B ends up with a marvelous  result here. w was bad here with c6 and that continuation.]
;W[nq];B[kq]C[Rob-  Very good for b.];W[qq];B[pq]L[qp][pj]M[ph]C[Rob- This is not bad, but I might have done r4  (a). However, r4 (a), would have been even better if the marked stone was at  q10 (b).]
;W[pr];B[qp]M[ph]C[Rob- Good! But look how much  better things would be if the marked stone was at q10..]
;W[oq]L[qr]C[Rob- This is wrong. w should r2 (a) here..b can r2, and w loses the corner,  plus b gets thick up the right side.]
;B[mr]L[rq][qr]C[Rob - I feel s3 (a)  or r2 (b) is better for b.];W
[rq];B[rp];W[mq];B[lq];W[nn];B[pn];W[om];B[ql]L[pm]C[Rob- There is no other move on the board here than q7  (a). You must q7.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[lo]C[Rob- Bad for w. It forces b  to take territory..];B
[ko]C[Rob- Good.];W[ln];B[fm];W[el];B[gq]L[fc]C[Rob- This is way too slow.   I'd much prefer f17 (a)..]
;W[jc];B[ci]M[gq]C[Rob- Now b is invading in  w's area, and is sure to get 4-5 pts, while strengthening w considerably. It  should be clear that g3 was not good at that point..]
;W[dj]L[cg][dg]C[Rob-  Not a good response by w. I'd prefer c13 (a), or maybe d13(b).]
;B[di]L[cj]C[Rob- I'd prefer c10 (a) here. It makes b considerably stronger, and  threatens to cut out w's base.]
;W[cj];B[cf];W[fd];B[ee]L[bd]C[Rob-  I  feel that b16 (a) is the only move here.]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[pm]L[gd][ge][ce]M[dd][ed][fd]C[Rob-  Very bad for w. b is building w territory on the 4th line under the marked  stones. w must g16 (a) at least, and maybe g15 (b).  I'd probably g15. The  only other alternative might be c15 (c).]
;B[qm];W[pj];B[qj];W[pk];B[qk];W[in];B[io]L[kn]C[Rob- I feel  that j5 is too passive. I would really prefer l6 (a).]
;W[kn];B[hn];W[jo];B[jp];W[jn];B[hp]L[ho]C[Rob- This should be h5 (a).]
;W[fl]
(;B[gi]C[Rob- This is good.. However, w can e11 (a). See the variation..]

(;W[ij]C[Rob- See the variation for what e11 can do..It looks scary to me..
W's actual move is a bit slack.];B[hk];W[ik];B[ni]C[Rob- Very nice!];W[nj]
;B[mi];W[mj];B[oe]L[li][lc][rd]C[Rob- I'm not sure I see the purpose of this move. I'd  prefer another push to m11 (a), or maybe m17 (b).. I'd probably most prefer  s16 (c)..

black is ahead in solid territory, but must get into the top. He can't allow  w to have the whole top, and p15 aims at giving w too much.]
;W[ne]L[od]C[Rob-- Oh, real bad by w.. He must must must  p16 (a).];B
[od];W[oc]
(;B[qd]L[pc]C[Rob- I feel that q17 (a), is b's  move here. See the variation.]
;W[qc];B[pe];W[pc];B[rd];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hl];W[im];B[ki]L[hd][bd]
[je]C[Rob- b has a problem here. He is ignoring the top,  which is quickly losing weakness. The middle is maybe 20 pts, while the top  is 50 pts, potentially! h16 (a), reduces it, b16 (b), reduces a bit, and gets  b some territory. l11 doesn't get b territory, cause of the marked stones,  and doesn't hit w where he lives.. If I were w, I'd ignore it, and play k15  (c).]
;W[kj];B[ih]C[Rob- Pretty much the same  comment here..];W[hj]L[bd][hd]
C[Rob- This is a VERY small move by w. Again, b16 (a),  h16(a), and moves like that are the way to respond to this..]
;B[gj];W[gk];B[ej];W[ek];B[gd]L[ge]M[ih][ki]C[Rob- Ok! g16 is not what I'd do, but it's  good. We can see why pushing earlier at g16, or haneing at g15  (a) was so  huge for w.. There was no reason for w to do anything else.. This could be a  game winning sequence for b.. The slow moves in the middle by w really hurt  him here.. If w had g15, he'd be getting territory while showing that the  marked stones didn't have enough potential..]
;W[gc];B[cd]L[hd][de]C[Rob- This is very bad for b. h16 (a), seems the only move. It gets b  some territory, and w almost has to answer. c16 is fraught with danger...  What will b do if w just d15 (b)?]
;W[de]L[ll]C[Rob- b got a big  problem here.. .];B[df];W[ce];B[be];W
[bd];B[ad];W[cc]L[hd][bf][hc]C[Rob- Even  here, the biggest move is h16 (a).. b14 (b) is 9 pts in gote for w. b should  let him have it if he wants it! b takes h16 (a), and if w b14 (b) in gote,  then b gets h17 (c), to add to w's loss...]
;B[af];W[ge]L[hd]C[Rob- This really hurts black. I think if b gets h16 (a), then he wins this  game without much trouble.]
;B[gf];W[hd];B[he];W[ie]L[km];B[hf];W[if];B[kf];W[jg];B[kg];W[kd]L[nf]
C[Rob- Now w has the entire top, and b is  behind by 10-15..Thing is, I might have done  o14. (a). It is close to being  sente, I think, and reduces b's potential there..]
;B[nf]C[Rob-  This is certainly the right move..];W[jh];B[kh];W[hh];B[hi]
;W[ii];B[hg];W[ig];B[fg];W[gh];B[fi];W[ac];B[bj];W[bk];B[ck];W[dk];B[bl]
;W[cl]L[ak]C[Rob- This is  wrong for w, he should just a9 (a).];B[ak]
;W[bm];B[ck];W[dm]M[hk][hl]C[Rob- This move is unnecessary, the marked stones are dead..]
;B[bk]C[Rob- This was really a big reduction. I feel this gets  b back in the game..]
;W[ae];B[bf]L[sq][lj][rc]C[Rob- This is a big move.. However,  b has some good sentes.. Like t3 (a), and m10 (b).  Also s17 (c) is probably  the biggest move on the board.]
;W[bo]C[Rob- b5 is also  very large..];B[bp];W[oi];B[oh];W[li];B[lh];W[lj]
;B[pi];W[pl]C[
 chameleon 25k*: is entering byo-yomi];B[rb];W[rc];B[sc];W[qb];B[nc];W[nb]
C[Rob- I feel like this should be n17 (a).  b gets an important reduction  here..]
;B[md];W[mc];B[me];W[nc];B[ld];W[lc];B[ke]C[
 stevenh 18k : is entering byo-yomi];W[al]L[sp]C[Rob- This is kind of a weird move  for w.. He has some big moves, like t4 (a).]
;B[am];W[an];B[bi];W[ap];B[aq]C[Rob- b has to make sure of his ko threats before playing this..  I'm not at all sure of the score.. b did reduce w's top some, and w has  gotten little anywhere else. I feel like b must fight this ko, however..]
;W[bq];B[ao];W[mf];B[le];W[ap];B[cq]L[qr]C[Rob- No, b must play  the ko.. r2 (a) is a very nice threat.]
;W[ar];B[br];W[aq];B[bs];W[co];B[ep];W[ra];B[sb];W[sp]C[Rob- w is getting all the big endgame moves..]
;B[so];W[sq];B[rn];W[nr];B[ls];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[fh]L[oj][jd]C[Rob- I feel that p10  (a) is better, also k16 (b), is better. k16 is gote, but bigger than f12.]
;W[on];B[po];W[oj];B[jd];W[kc]C[
 chameleon 25k*: has entering byo-yomi again];B[je]L[jq]C[Rob- Good!]
;W[id];B[ji];W[jj];B[mg];W[ns];B[ei]L[al][ms]C[Rob- This move seems  unnecessary. a8 (a) would be better,  or just n1 (b)]
;W[ms];B[lr];W[gd];B[al];W[ad];B[sd]C[
 stevenh 18k : has entering byo-yomi again];W[qa];B[gg];W[ih];B[as];W[ao]
;B[cr];W[jf];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];C[Rob- Well, you did a nice job  reducing w on the left side and the middle to win this game, after playing a  territory oriented opening. One piece of advice would be to watch where the  points are. After you limited w's potential in the middle, you almost got in  trouble by letting him have too much on top.  You did a nice job of taking  advantage of his slow moves, but I think a stronger player wouldn't have  given you that chance..   A very good opening though, up until g3. I hope this review comes in handy,  and sorry it took so long. :)]

[nb];B[mc];W[mb];B[sb];W[re];B[rf];W[sd];B[pf];W[pa];B[sf]M[mc][nc]C[Rob- Again w dead, and  in gote, cause he must fix up the weakness causeed  by the marked stones.. So I really feel q17 was the only move for b..]
)))
(;W[ei];B[eh];W[fi];B[fh];W[gh]L[gl][ni]C[Rob- This seems potentially  unpleasant for b.. I think that b can get out in the center easier with g8  (a), or o11 (b).]
