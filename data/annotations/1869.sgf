C[The game was played at a Go tournament in Darmstadt, Germany.
I played White. I think my opponent was playing stronger.
I won this game because of a mistake Black did in the end, losing
a
group of 11 stones.
I want to share this review with my opponent, so comments on
the play
of both sides would be appreciated.

Thank you very much for your time to review this game.

Peter

Hello Peter,

my name is Christian Reiling, German 1 dan.

Although I could write in German, of course :) , I think it is
better to write in English, so more GTL-users can read.

I have already "walked through" the game and cannot believe that
you are "only" 8kyu and 6kyu.

Surely there are some mistakes, from my point of view, but all
in all I got the feeling both players know already a lot of go!

I hope I can help a bit with this review.

Feel free to ask, if you have further questions!

Yours

Until here, I did not really find a mistake from neither side.

Since Black has sente now, I think the situation is very balanced.]
