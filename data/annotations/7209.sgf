C[Hi,
Thanks for the help.
This is tha last game I had on Panda. I was black and I'm a beginner.
Cheers,

R: Hello, Van. I will review this game for your. My comments starts with the letter 'R' (Reviewer).
Unfortunately, this game doesn't follow one of the GTL guidelines. I mean "close games". So I may only sketch out mistakes.
Most of your mistakes were answered by opponent's more serious mistakes, so I had to take "what could have been" approach and try not to go too far to teach incorrect things.]
;B[pq]C[I'm very interested in the opening game.];W[dd];B[cp]
;W[qc];B[eq];W[nr]C[I had no idea how to repond to move 6.

R: This is a very strange approach move. It's so low it's asking for attack.]

(;B[mq]C[R: Pretty strong. It seems right to me.
If you don't want to start fight immediately, simply attack from the distamce (Contact play leads to mutual strenghening)]
;W[nq]
(;B[jq]C[R: You're forcing white to build you territory. You might also go for influence. (see variation)
But since wall would look into empty space, I prefer your choose.]
;W[np]TR[pq]C[Move 10 also confused me.

R: It's purposes was to make white's group safer while pressuring the marked stone.]
;B[po]C[R: Just in time.];W[mr];B[lq];W[pr]
(;B[qq]C[My move (15) seems slow to me now.

R: The move is urgent. 
If you want to restrict white's space, you could have played hane at S2, but this makes game complicated. By the way, now black is clealy ahead, so there's no need in that.
It wasn't move 15 that bad, it was the earlier mistake at move 9.
And in the end, B got around 12 points, while W got only 3.]
;W[qr]
(;B[qk]C[Should 17 be further out?

R: I would prefer to play kakari to build structure around the same point. See variation. As for extension, yes, I would prefer it at Q10 or R10.]
;W[rr];B[rq]TR[ms][or][sr]SQ[pp][qn][qm][ql][rk][sq][sk]C[R: That's what I was talking about.]
;W[jc]
(;B[ci]C[Was 21 too far out?

R: Again, I'd rather make kakari here. As for the extension, it's better at C10 (classcial extension from shimari), since this would allow to handle invasions around C7 better.]
;W[lr];B[kr];W[sq];B[sp];W[sr];B[ro]C[R: I prefer solid connection over hanging one. It makes lesser potential for threats.]
;W[mo];B[qe];W[oc];B[qh]SQ[ci][cp][eq][qk][qe][jq]C[R: Now, let's look at the stones. Virtually all ofyour stones are situationed at the third line. This is solid, but makes little influence towards cener, and game is going to be there sooner or later.]
;W[op]
(;B[pp]C[33 seems very slow to me now...

R: See variattion. In any case, W got nothing by this exchange, while B became even more solid.]
;W[oq]C[R: W said "pass".];B[cl]C[R: Since white is behind, this move provokes invasion. So I'd prefer it to be a line lower.]
;W[cn]
(;B[dn]C[I never know how to deal with this simple invasion.

R: See variation. Your move is one of the ways, that emphasies territory. It is useful as secure play, but invader gets more of it.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[do]
(;B[en]C[R: But if you need territory, this should be the other way. This way allows white to flatten your position.]
;W[co];B[dp];W[eo]
(;B[em];W[fo];B[dl]C[R: You spent two moves to capture on stone, which is expendable for W. See var for move 45.]
;W[bp]C[R: Now white has a free run on your territory.];B[bq]
;W[ap];B[aq]
(;W[bm]C[R: This should be not here. White would be more stable and able to harrass black's postion.]
;B[bo]C[R: Good.];W[bn];B[ao];W[an]C[R: W made you defend where you would want to defend soooner or late. A "thank you move".]
;B[bl];W[ho];B[ce]C[R: Too close. Contact play gets you mutual strenghening. This might be what you want, since the game is in your favor, but it usualy erases possibility to invade corner.]

[gq][hq][iq][ks][qk][qh][qe][po][pp][pq][qq][rq][sp][bl][cl]
[ci][ce][jq][kq][kr][eq][dp][cp][bo]C[R: Now black is clearly ahead. You may compare potential territories yourself.
When you're this ahead it's good idea to protect your weaknesses or expand safely.
Had this invasion failed, W would get both territory and influence.]
;W[hb]C[R: W64 contradicts principle of attacking from distance. Note that such contact play leads to mutual strenghening. White invited you to become stronger inside his own territory.]
;B[gb];W[ib];B[ec]C[R: White forced you to attack weakend corner.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fc];W[gd];B[eb]C[R: Why not D17? F18 is a false eye anyway.]
;W[ee];B[hd]C[R: The corner group is not alive yet. You don't need to force opponent to dig it deeper.]

(;W[ge];B[he]C[Is 75 a bad move?

R: It is. I allowed your opponent to play hane H14 for free. I'd rather leave this group as landmine, which may explode later in the game.]
;W[hf];B[ie];W[kd];B[if];W[hg];B[ff];W[gf];B[fe];W[fd];B[ed]
C[R: Very good. Earlier peek and cut allowed you to split white and take the corner.]
;W[ef];B[fg];W[eg];B[fh];W[eh];B[fi];W[ei];B[de]C[R: White shouldn't have missed this one. Until this move, attacker and defender could have swapped their roles.]

(;B[hj]LB[fh:A][eh:B]C[R: A group has 6 dame, B group has 4. You might just capture group B if you want to save your group A.]

(;B[db];W[fb];B[dc];W[ea];B[on]C[R: G3 or H3 is far more important, see variation for white's next move.]

Concentrate on which stones are key to you and which are just expendable.
Don't try to save the later ones if you can get compenstaion or if it costs you too much.
Don't forget about defense. It's thrilling to crush your opponent totally, but one could make a serious comeback when realises that he or she is cornered. Chances to make comeback gets higher with count of your weaknesses.]
