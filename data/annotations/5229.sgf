C[sw: Hi! Thanks for taking the time to review my game. I really appreciate it. It was a fun game, but I lost by 1.5 points. I gave it my all, so it'd be great if you could give me any pointers on how to improve my game. I'll also have a few questions of my own throughout the course of this review.

You're reviewing for black.

Thanks for the chance to review this game. It was an interesting game and you were unlucky to lose. 

I think you would benefit from looking at the opening in more detail. You do a couple of things in the opening that look standard, but in the situation are not good for you.  

The extension you ask about on the top is a small area whilst there is a big empty space across the bottom where you can stake out a vast area. 

Similarly, your invasion of the top left was too hasty I think and gave you a weak group that later struggled to make 2 eyes and no territory whilst allowing white to make territory for both sides. Indeed, if you look at White's invasion in the bottom right, this too caused more problems for white than it solved. Timing is something that takes experience to get a feel for, but both sides here are a little impatient i feel. 

The game was well balanced for a while - you solidified a lot of territory for white but had a big potnetial area of your own and when white let the corner die, you were well in front. That white managed to invade your bottom was really due to the fact that the top left was weak and had to struggle to make eyes, giving white a couple of free moves on the bottom.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo]TR[jp][jq]C[Now you have made the enclosure, black wants a move along the bottom at one of the marked points to extend from the corner. Thus White would like to play here too, to stop you from getting the big point.

This is a big area for a lot of the opening]
(;W[qf];B[qh]C[Nice move];W[qc]
(;B[pc]TR[jd]C[This is the wrong direction. The sequence you play out is only standard if you have a stone around K16, so that the wall you build faces a black stone.]
;W[qd];B[pe];W[rf];B[og];W[jd]TR[pc][pd][pe]C[White takes the point at which you would like to have a black stone. Now your wall faces white strength and is not so useful.]

(;B[ld]C[sw: To me, this _looked_ like a good move, but I didn't completely read through something like this. What do you think of this move?

I don't like it much! The real problem is your choice of direction with the 3-3 invasion as I said earlier, but given the situation, I would like to play on the bottom. There's not going to be much black territory on the top, so I would take sente to play on the bottom.]
;W[dj]C[now that white builds a sanrensei (3 stars) formation, K16 (or 15) is a huge point for both sides. Taking K16 is important.]

(;B[cf]C[this gives white a target to attack. better to expand your moyo now, and invade later.]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd]
(;B[ci]C[this is not usual becuase it is too easy for white to cramp black]
;W[cj];B[di]C[sw: Is this how I should've responded?

i think 21 is bad, but once you've played it, this is mandatory]

(;W[be];B[fi];W[ej];B[gh]C[i like this move, but the invasion has still not been a real  success for you.]
;W[gk]C[your group is (probably) alive, but it's not doing anything else, whilst white has taken territory on top, and built a nice shape on the bottom.]

(;B[fq]C[nice, the bottom is big, but i feel that this is a bit too close to white's strong stones.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[fo];B[eq];W[dq];B[go];W[fn]TR[bl][go]C[I think this exchange is bad for you. It solidifies white's territory. If you don't make it then there is still some potential to reduce it later.

Later in the game, if the top group is secure, then without the two marked stones, a move at the marked point (or something else) looks like a possible invasion. Once the marked stones are in place then invading looks very hard]
;B[kq]C[White's territories are quite robust now. Your bottom is large but less settled.


I'd estimate white's territory as:
35 points bottom left
25 top left
10 top right
70 total

and yours:
<5 left
maybe 10 top right
so you need as much as 
50-60 in the bottom to be ahead. 

This looks possible, i guess, but i wouls be a bit unhappy here at solidifying white's territory so much]
;W[mq]C[This is too aggressive.  i think you have a chance to punish white here. Like your invasion in the top, white will not make much territory while you solidify your areas]
;B[ko]C[good move];W[oo]
(;B[pm]C[Good move, keeps the white group unstable. This is my first instinct. However, because of the thinness of the knight enclosure in the corner, white can make shape, so perhaps I prefer the alternative. Also, white can make a monkey jump into the right side from s14 which will limit the potential territory on the side]
;W[pr];B[oq];W[or]
(;B[nq]C[i think perhaps keeping white out of the corner is important here since it is easy to make eyes there, plus it's easy to take territory there also.]
;W[nr];B[lr];W[qq];B[qp];W[pp]
(;B[np];W[rq]C[white can make eyes more easily in the corner, but sealing white into the corner is still very good for you]
;B[mr];W[qn];B[pn];W[rn];B[po];W[ro];B[rp];W[sp];B[hm]C[This is still a fair game, i think, but you have done well in the right due to white's overambitious invasion.]

;W[oh];B[ni];W[nh];B[mi];W[mh];B[li];W[kg]C[This sequence is not great for white, because you swallow up 6 white stones so provided the black group on top is ok, you come out ahead.

The last 20 or so moves for white have been a disaster but you still have two unsecured groups to take care of, plus the string of stones on the right needs watching]

(;W[jh];B[ge]C[this looks a little aggressive, with the left hand group cut off and a string of black stones on the right that needs to capture the white stones to ensure safety. I think you need to secure your own groups before invading again.]
