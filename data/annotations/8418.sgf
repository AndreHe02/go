C[L: hello i am lolman your reviewer and i will begin all my coments with an L
some general notes:
1 look for the biggest moves. sometimes you were more worried about single stones then territory
2 learn to know when your area is safe so you can play more efficiant move. sometimes you played moves to be safe but they werent neccasary.
3.learn wich direction to attack in. many times you extended or attacked from the wrong direction to give white more than he shouldve gotten.
4. final thing is the main reason you got ahead was because in the endgame you were able to invade when you shouldve have been able to. if he had realized what you were doing and read ahead sooner he couldve easily stopped you and you wouldve lost and when you get to just a little higher rank they will see it. so learn to gain during the begining and middle as last minute invasions dont work most of the time.]

(;B[cd]C[L: this move is not your best choice while it does still keep that one stone on c14 from living it gives white the chance to take away quite a bit more territory because you already have a very solid base up top so you would want to play the oposite direction to solidify this territory. a better move wouldve been d17 see variation.]

(;B[oo]C[L: this move is very pointless there is absolutly nothing you gain from making this move. a better move might have been to look for something to give you more points or solidify your territory or even invade his. see variations for some posibilities]
;W[cm];B[lq];W[qg];B[og];W[qe];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[oq];B[re]
C[L: i belive this move is incorect. all you gain is one stone maybe because you probably couldve already killed the entire group anyway. a better move would be to conect your stones that it looks like he is trying to break up because at the moment your p5 and m3 stones connected pose a great threat to him getting the middle territory.]

;W[lp]C[was it worth responding here, or should I have gone for the kills on the right side with S12? what's bigger?

L: i would have to say s12 is the bigger point however because you end up being able to play s12 later you got lucky next time it would be better to play s12. this is because you may gain like 5 points down here by responding you gain much more by getting an entire side.]

(;W[sj];B[sf]C[because of bad move at S13, I wanted to prevent a white connection

L: this is a good thought but you couldve also achieved this without making a possible ko by simply making the move s14 because you can always just capture with t16 to save those stones]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[po];B[pn];W[om];B[ml]C[here you have the right idea but a better move wouldve been o8 so that stone cant get attacked and let white into your territory a little less]
;W[mk];B[nl];W[mj];B[li];W[ij];B[ih];W[mh];B[lh]C[L: this move is made in the wrong direction you want to prevent white from getting into your territory but by making this move white can play n11 to connect  and make it living then just waltz right in.]
;W[lk];B[jn]C[should I have been protecting my area up top, or was moving into white's territory here at K6 a bigger move? I thought white K6 would be a huge move for white]
;W[lg];B[kg];W[kk];B[jh];W[on]
(;B[ol]C[L: this move is actualy pointless as those 3 white stones are doomed anyway this just takes a point from you. a better move would be either n11 or s8 see variations for reasoning]
