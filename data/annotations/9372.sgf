AB[pp][dd][pd][dp]C[Hi!
My name is Adriano.
I played this game with the gnugo engine and I thought this game was interesting. I dont know joseki except the basic initial moves. I want to understand my mistakes.

Hi Adriano,
My name is Troy I will be conducting your review today. I hope you learn a lot. I will pass comment where necessary.]

As a side not remember not to follow your opponent around. There is likely better or more urgent moves of which you can make.

All the best and good luck.])
