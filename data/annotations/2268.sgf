C[I'd like to know on what strategical or tactical topics my greatest weaknesses are, to find out what to learn next.

The reviewer:

I not very much stronger than you (2K only in Germany). But for a 6K I recommend

Tesuji by Davies

Will make your tactics stronger.

Else find a club and have a good player teach you. Do not play fast, but try to think about your moves. Have your games reviewed by a good player.

Have fun.

After review:

As most often, you failed to thing hard in the most complicated part of the game. There you made unnecessary moves and failed to make the decisive moves. This is a common fault.

Take your time, especially, when things get complicated!];B[qd]

;W[dh]C[Actually I am unsure about this move.

First of all, the connection can be cut. Then it does not direcly threaten the black corner. And it does not completey enclose the black corner. Also, the value of the wall is little because of the black stone in front of it, just in the right distance.

Take a big spot instead, e.g the handicap point on the right.]
;B[bh]C[If black reacts, then things are OK ...

Black should use this move to do something positive.];W[hf]
C[Black is pressed to form territory on the upper side. The outer wall compensates for this a bit, so the move is not completey wrong.]
;B[jd];W[qj];B[qp];W[pn];B[qn];W[pm]
(;B[po]C[Does not look like a good move. Makes White safer. Take the corner instead on Q3. or P3.]
;W[oo]
(;B[qm]C[Wrong direction.

Follow the variation.];W[ql]C[Too narrow. The move does not threaten black really.

It can also be cut.];B[rl]C[Sort of helping White.

Note: the corner is alway biggest!];W[qk]
(;B[fq]C[This can be played in the middle of the lower side, leaving room for an extension to either side.]

(;W[dq]C[Must be a pincer.];B[fo];W[dn]C[The left side is open, so this move does not gain as much as white wants.]
;B[jp]C[Good direction. Maybe on the third row.];W[lq]C[Because now, the black position is open.]

(;B[lp]C[Don't be afraid to take territory. Especially, if you get more than the opponent.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[gp];B[fp];W[ho];B[hq];W[iq];B[hp]C[When you do such a move, you must takte the time to think it through. This will end in desaster.]

(;W[ck];B[bk];W[ci];B[aj];W[dj];B[bi];W[jf]C[Here
I think I should have attacked one of the two weak black groups at the bottom.
Maybe at L6 or E2?

You do attack these groups. The move is OK for that purpose.]
;B[fk];W[hk];B[qg];W[ph]C[Now it seems as if you cannot loose any more.]

(;W[ol]C[No. You must attack harder.

This is a lost move.];B[hr];W[ir];B[in];W[hn];B[nn]
(;W[on]C[Another unnecessary move!

This is the stage of the game, where you must think really hard. Take your time!]
;B[mo];W[mk]C[Now, Black is alive.];B[kn];W[jo];B[kl];W[kk]
;B[il];W[hl];B[jk];W[ik]C[Clearly a bad move. Does not help at all.]
