C[reid: When w has k16 already in place, then b d15 is usually a problem.  see var.  In general, b needs to play low (at c15) or stay further away (with c14 or d14)]

reid: b's shape is a bit awkward here.  Perhaps the double hane is better than e13.]

reid: This looks like the right time and place for the invasion.];B[cm]
C[reid: hard for b to decide which side.];W[ch];B[bg];W[cg];B[cf];W[bh]
;B[nq];W[kp]C[The pincer is natural when w has an extension along the right side (around q10).  see var.]

(;B[no];W[pn];B[pr]C[reid: b should probably not make this exchange.  If the o5 group gets out safely, he might want to play at r3 later on.]
;W[qq]C[
reid: now the 3-3 invasion is gone for b.];B[ip]C[reid: i like this move for b.]
;W[mp];B[np];W[lr];B[qr];W[rq]C[reid: since w doesn't hane here (at s2), the b group is a lot more secure for the later fighting.]
;B[jq];W[mq];B[nr];W[ln];B[nm];W[pl];B[jm]C[reid: hmmm. not sure about the direction of k7. perhaps n8, m8 ore o9 would be more useful for b.]
;W[ll];B[nk];W[pj]C[reid: w's natural responses are pushing the b group into white's strength.]
;B[lj];W[kj]C[reid: this could lead to some messy fighting in this area (turns out it didn't).  simply playing at l9 would be simpler and safer.  that way, the weakness of the knights move might come back to haunt b later.  also, l9 helps to cover the weakness developing at m7.]
;B[lk];W[ml]C[reid: w n8 might be a bit of aji-keshi. probably best just to play l8 directly.]
;B[nl];W[kl];B[jl];W[kk];B[ni];W[ij];B[mo]C[reid: i don't understand this move. b must think that w can cut at o6?  the exchange for w m5 is aji keshi.]
;W[lo];B[jg]C[reid: woah! this seems like the kind of move that can turn into a game losing move.  It's in w's area of influence, it's not attached to any b groups, it's not attacking w very strongly, and its not taking any territory.  it seems like the only thing it's doing is preventing w from taking center territory, but there isn't that much center territory to be made, anyway...]
;W[kh];B[kg];W[lg];B[jh];W[ki];B[fg];W[hg]C[reid: nice spot for w.];B[hh]
;W[gh];B[lf]C[reid: since b has cut aji at m12, he might be better off trying to escape at h11]
;W[kf];B[mg]C[reid: n13 is aji keshi.];W[lh];B[hf]C[reid: clamp is sometimes a tesuji, but it doesn't seem to work very well here.]

C[a w double hane might be possible, but it leaves a lot of aji.];B[nm]
;W[mn];B[og]C[p13 is now a vital point for both sides to expand moyos.  since b gets it, i think b is a bit better in this variation]

(;W[dg]C[w makes the most severe attack possible.];B[fe]C[f15 is really b's only choice.]
;W[fc];B[he]C[whithout k16, white normally responds with h17, and b gets to pincer somewhere around d10, but...]
;W[gd]C[white makes a severe peep.];B[ge];W[cj]C[and white gets sente to prevent the pincer.  b ends up with a stick.  B can push down at h16 and get a small life along the upper side, but w is not really in danger, so w is not concerned (yet).  In this game, it looks like w could at least get the komi back by playing this way...]
