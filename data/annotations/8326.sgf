(;B[hd]C[The result seems to be ok. It was hard for me to find next move. What would you play?


*Black's move here doesn't look necessary.
As for white's next move, I have a couple of ideas:]
(;W[ck]MA[ci]C[*This is the urgent area but I think this move is too close to the c11 stone.
 I'd rather it's at c7.
The reason is that if you capture this stone now, so if white sacrifices it, you don't make alot of points here. 
But if you play at c7, you loosely close off the corner and attack the stone on a large scale at the same time.]

Big endgame move but there are much bigger and more urgent moves at the moment.]
;B[rj]
(;W[qk];B[rk];W[qm]C[Seems its not so good for me. Where was my mistake?

*I think the only mistake was of judgment, mainly to do with moyos which is difficult since moyos can be pretty vague. I recommend you study some of Takemiya's games and just get a feel for what he does. Especially ones against Chikun as they have somewhat contrasting styles.
When we are weaker we are taught that the centre is small and difficult to surround so we should take the corners and sides, but there are times the centre is much bigger. It's difficult to see since it's a little counter-intuitive.]
