;B[pe];W[qb];B[pf];W[qe]C[W R15 better at S14.
S14 makes S12 possible, which means more efficient.];B[oh]C[Pros like to play Q18, to seal the leakage on top.]
;W[ed]C[E16 a good move? I will play C10.
My assumption: W can exchange Q18 with B O17 in early stage.
W C10, B E16,  W Q18, if B responds with O17, which I think it is painful (inefficient), then W F3 or K4.]
;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[be];W[bb]C[W B18 bad.
Usual move is at G17.];B[pb]C[B Q18, huge, but wrong direction.
B A18 looks small but huge because it means safety of D14 group.]
;W[ac]C[Now, B in pain.
If B B16 (which looks ugly), then W G17.
Now, W has 2 good points at J18 and C12. Technical term for this is OMIAI.
If W is aggressive, W can even omit G17 and attack at C12 right away.]
;B[bd];W[hc]C[W H17 as compared to G17 is a helping move.
Helped B to seal upper right corner.
Also, lost chance of attacking at C12 or D11.];B[ic];W[gc]C[W G17 looks unnatural to me.
W H18 seems better.];B[qn]C[B R6 wrong direction.
B C10 more urgent.];W[gf]C[W G14 is meaningless.
W C12 or D11 attack definitely better.
Gain points at lower right while attacking B D14 group.];B[if]
C[B J14 no doubt looks big, but it is wrong direction again.
Safety (or attack & defend issue) has priority over points.
Still, B C10 crucial.
Even though, we can see that G14/J14 exchange, B gained.
This further proved that W G14 is bad, equivalent to losing one hand/ turn.]
;W[ci]C[Good move by W, but can be even better if played at D11.
This is because C11 gives B a chance to play a good move at D12.]
;B[dh]C[Good move.];W[ch]C[I got a feeling this move is trying to cheat B to play C13.
I think W D11 is correct.];B[cg]C[B tricked. C13 too small.
W D11 better.];W[eg]C[W E13 bad move...
Why not W D11, B E12, then W F10?
This direction has more potential.];B[dg];W[dj]C[Steady, but a bit slow.
W E10 better, no fear for B D11 cut.
B D11, W D10, B C10 cut, W C9, B B10, W B9, B B11, W K4.
Cut by B D11 welcomed.];B[ei]C[Since B D11 sente (cut at C10, W needs C9), B can play F11.]
;W[ej];B[fi];W[hg]C[Wrong direction again.
This move has no value for W.
Invasion at L13/ M13 possible, so need not to worry about the moyo.
W G9 ( this only move), developing own moyo + attacking D14 group is a must.]
;B[fj]C[Good move by B.
This move restrcits moyo of W + ensure own safety, very crucial.]
;W[el]C[Weak move, W F9 a must.];B[np]C[Good point.   But why not B F8, W E7, W P6, W O4, B J11?
What you think of this sequence?];W[pn]C[It looks like B opens door for W to enter his moyo...
That's why I proposed B P6.];B[pm];W[on];B[qo];W[op];B[rq]C[Trapped by joseki.
But did B considered playing P7?
I think B P7 is correct.
W O8 a move too good...];W[pi]C[Promping move?
Why not O8?];B[ph];W[om];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ig]C[W J13 not so good...too kind...
Why not L13 or M13?
If B responds, then W J4.];B[jf];W[fk]C[Must well fix the boundary by L12.
W L12, B M13, W M12, B N13 then back to D3 or J4 (the big points).]
;B[fq]C[This move is just too good...
W lost one hand/turn for playing F9...
Another alternative is B K3 which is as good, G3 and O3 OMIAI.]
;W[ip]C[Good move.];B[cq];W[dq]C[W D3 wrong direction.
B O3 there, lower side difficult to turn into territory.];B[cp]
;W[do];B[dr];W[er];B[cr];W[eq];B[cn];W[bg];B[bf];W[bh]TR[cn]
C[Wrong direction.
The marked B stone has restricted the development.
Seal at H10 far better, B needs to play B12 to survive, then W O3 (conservative) or R2 (aggressive).]
;B[hj];W[hl];B[jj];W[ii];B[ij];W[ok]C[Wrong direction.
L12 attack, or K8 or L8 defend.];B[oj]C[Weak move.
L12 a safer way to victory.];W[nj];B[oi]C[Very weak move...
B can always connect at S10...];W[lj]C[W L12 (attack + invading opponent territoty) or L8 (secure territory) better.]
;B[ki]C[B landed safely, game over.];W[gk];B[hi];W[kg]C[Overplayed.]
;B[jg];W[mh]C[Why not just N12 without L13?];B[mf]C[Declaration of victory by B.]
;W[kh];B[li]C[Bad move. Misread?
J12 sound & simple. Why crack your brain?];W[mi];B[lh];W[lg]
;B[mg]C[No point cutting.
When one can connect at both ends,  it's same like no cut.]
;W[jh];B[fg]C[Good move.];W[ff];B[ef]C[Wrong move.
B G13. Overlooked this move?
W H14, B eats with E14 and win.];W[fh];B[eh];W[gh];B[ee];W[fd]
C[Only one eye now...];B[dd];W[ce];B[jl];W[kk];B[il];W[jk];B[ik]
;W[jn]C[Kill or resign?];B[kn]C[Maybe B J6 first...];W[kl]C[Good move.   Regained some lost ground.]
;B[in];W[jo];B[hm];W[gm];B[gn];W[jm]C[Need not. No eye for B here.
Value for this move limited to 1.
But if W F7...B will have problem staying alive and kicking...]
;B[im];W[go]C[Seems bad.   Why not W H5 or just F7?];B[fm];W[ho]
C[Definitely wrong!!!
W G8 a must.];B[gl];W[hk];B[fo];W[co]C[Bad move, just W D6 will do.
Save this move as threat for ko.];B[bo];W[dn];B[cm];W[fp]C[Losing move.
If W want to kill, D7 or F7 (slightly weaker but more secure).]
;B[em];W[dm];B[dl];W[cl];B[fl];W[ek];B[gp];W[ep];B[io]C[B in luck. By default should be dead.
Need not. Just B H6, B won.];W[hp];B[hn];W[en];B[fn];W[bl]C[Trick move or wrong timing...
W R2 bigger.];B[bn]C[B tricked.
Missed chance to play B O3 or Q2.];W[qq];B[nq]C[Too late.];W[lq]
;B[jp]C[The next 15 moves by B are considered "shitty".
When you already won, why messe up with opponent?   It is very impolite.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo];W[km];B[jq];W[gq];B[lr];W[mr];B[kr]
;W[mq];B[nr];W[mo];B[ms];W[or]C[Bad move.
 S2 then J18 or simply resign.];B[oq];W[pr];B[pq];W[qp];B[no]
;W[mn];B[nn];W[mm];B[nm];W[nl];B[hr];W[gr];B[hq]C[Die in GOTE.
W need not respond.];W[iq]C[Game over...
Need not to bother, B also DEAD...
Too careless, W should learn from this big mistake.];B[ir];W[gp]
;B[kq];W[ln];B[js];W[rp]C[What???
M1 still eat half...
Resign even more elegant than playing S5...];B[ns]C[Good move.
B discovered W N1.];W[rn];B[rm];W[rg];B[rh];W[sh];B[si];W[sg]
;B[qg];W[rf];B[ro]C[Good move.];W[hs];B[ls];W[gs];B[is];W[ib]
;B[jb];W[ke];B[kf];W[lf];B[le];W[hb];B[qa]C[Wrong timing.
B should play K19.];W[kb]C[Good move.];B[rb]C[Good move.];W[rc]
C[Wrong move!
T15 only move to survive.];B[ra]C[Wrong.
B T15, W dead and must resign.];W[sd];B[ja]C[Wrong.
W M16 SENTE...];W[ld];B[me];W[jc];B[kc]C[Wrong.
Should reduce loss at L16.];W[jd];B[je];W[kd];B[lc];W[md];B[nd]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[lb];B[sp];W[rr];B[sr]C[Ko for fun???
Or to waste time?];W[sq];B[fe];W[ge];B[rq];W[ri];B[sj];W[sq]
;B[se];W[re];B[rq];W[rj];B[sk];W[sq];B[ih]C[This move lose 1 point.]
;W[hh];B[rq];W[rk];B[sl];W[sq];B[ji];W[ih];B[rq];W[rl];B[sm]
;W[sq];B[sc]C[This move loses about 4 points.];W[sb];B[rq];W[ng]
;B[ne]C[Finally, W resigned :)
B leads early but failed to win safely.
The lesson to learn from this game is the "sense of direction" - play where there are potential, it's like investment in those undervalued assets.   Another lesson is not to be careless.
If not for the two mistakes by W, W should have won.])
