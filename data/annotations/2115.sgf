C[I'm at a point where I don't feel I know what my problem is. If you could please point out the obvious blunders, I thought I played this game well, I was a little over extended, but that is the usual for me.
----------------

Opening and middle game was good.  I made a couple suggestions.  You really fell apart only in the endgame.  I tried to help with that.  Let me know if it doesn't make sense or if you have any questions.

;B[jd];W[pf]LB[qg:a][ph:b]C[You're looking pretty good so far.  Rather than 32, I would have played lower at 'a'.  This still crowds black's top right corner reducing it's value.  A move at 'a' doesn't let black slide under into your territory and it would be close enough to 6 to make it hard to invade.    Where you've played, if I were black, I would play at 'b' and split you in half.  You would probably have a hard time handling this.]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[eb];W[qf]LB[ph:a]C[Nice.  This fixes the problem with 'a'.]
;B[hp]C[Black has a wall with 11,13 and 15, and 21,23 and 29.  If you can get a living group up between those two walls, you eliminate virtually all of their value.  So when black plays 37, you should be thinking of how you are going to move up into that prime real estate.

Just a comment that my help your thinking...Walls need an extension to be valuable.  If you can make your opponent build a wall, and then deprive him of the ability to make an extension from it, this is BIG.]

[ij:b][ii:c][hi:d]C[Rather than 80, you could keep your stones connected out with any of the marked points.  Look for alternatives when your opponent makes you make a defensive move.  Any of these alternatives are better than the simple connection as they move you further out into the middle.]
;B[kj];W[gk];B[ki];W[ji];B[nj];W[ei];B[mi]LB[fl:a][fn:b]C[Good for just letting these two stones go.  Black invested a lot in killing them.

'a' is sente and you should take it.  It threatens a followup at 'b', so black can't ignore it.  Having a stone at 'a' could be helpful for you shortly.]

Assume you make a move at 'a'.

Very rough score:  62 white, 52 black without komi.

Now this is not how the game ended.  You got killed in the endgame.  It's hard to review endgame -- lots of little moves.]
;B[gm]LB[db:a][hc:b][bc:c][re:d][fm:e]C[
The trick to endgame is figuring out sente.  There are four kinds of moves in endgame.  They are:  double sente, sente, reverse sente, and gote.

A "double sente" move is sente for whoever moves there first.    "Sente" means it is forcing if you move there, but not of your opponent moves there.

"Reverse sente" is forcing for your opponent but not for you.

"gote" is not forcing for anyone.

A move at 'a' would be an example of double sente.  If white moves there, he threatens a followup around 'b', destroying much of black's top.  If black moves at 'b' he threatens a followup at 'c'  Neither side can ignore the move.  Double sente moves are extremely valuable.  Another double sente moves is at 'd'.  Whoever moves there first profits and retains sente (the right to move first somewhere else).

A move at 'e' is an example of sente.  It is forcing for you, but not for black.  Sente moves that do something are a high priority.  You get profit and retain sente.

Gote moves have to be very huge before they are worth playing instead of a sente move.  Avoid moves that are gote.]
;W[jg]C[This move is gote.  It does not threaten anything.  It just fills up space.  Black can ignore it.]
;B[ld]C[This move is also gote for black.];W[oh]C[Gote and small.]
;B[hd]LB[db:a]C[Gote, but it makes a move at 'a' into gote for white, so has more value than first meets the eye.]
;W[gf]LB[re:a][db:b][rr:c]C[Gote.  Plus the corner is almost always bigger than the middle.  A move at 'a' or 'b' or even 'c' is better.]
