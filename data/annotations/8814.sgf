RE[B+R]

C[R: Hello. I will prefix my comments with R. I will also try providing some alternatives during the game to show what I am thinking of.
I hope you'll enjoy.

Hal: All my third person comments are my analysis  made after reviewing the game myself. Any first person comments are my reasoning during the game.

I don't have any specific questions. Any move that I realized was bad I commented on in my own review of the game. I would like to know if you agree with the reasoning in my comments, and if there are any bad moves that I missed.

Really, aside from the mistakes I pointed out, I don't know how I managed to lose so badly.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[dp];B[cf]
(;W[fc];B[bd]
(;W[cb]TR[fc]SQ[dd]C[R: the triangled stone is on the third line. Although it lacks the high (I mean toward center) intentions, it does well in making the corner stone solid. This is why the B attack can be ignored. See the variant on fourth line.
Anyway, W can play tenuki, or if W wants to answer go for 3x3 (see both variations)]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[bb]
(;W[eb]SQ[db]C[R: you don't need this (although wrong, better square) connection. See what happens if B is ignored]
;B[ca];W[db];B[cd]TR[nd]C[R: this is the time for W to get sente. IMHO, the best would be triangle or around]
;W[df];B[de];W[ee];B[ce];W[eg]TR[dg]CR[ed]SQ[ef]C[R: I would have played lower: triangle. B can't cut on top (circle), and hardly can do something on center (square)]
;B[dg];W[ef];B[dh]
(;W[cm]SQ[eh]C[R: good. B is on fourth line. Still, I would have played one line more before this slip under]
;B[ck];W[el];B[ek];W[fk]C[R: ok, still somehow weak connection. I would be ready letting B cut and possible capture some stones, but use this opportunity to build moyo
 on top and bottom];B[ej];W[fj];B[fi];W[fh]SQ[fj][fk]TR[hg]
C[R: the W 2 square stones looks weak. I would have make an extension at triangle and after B answers get back with an extension from squared stones.]
;B[ei]
(;W[gi]C[R: although the goal is fine (connecting the 2 groups and boxing in B), I think connection is too weak. I would give up this goal for building while being attacked by B. See variant.]
;B[dl]
(;W[dm]TR[em]C[R: what about triangle?];B[fl];W[em];B[gj]C[R: give up 2 stones in center and build wall in center]
(;W[gl]C[Hal: I made this move because I misread the ladder.]
;B[gk]
(;W[gn];B[fm];W[fn]TR[nd]C[R: good connection. W should aim now for approach around triangle.
It is second time I mention that move. It is vital because tries to work with the wall on left. The idea is to play as far as possible from a wall inviting B to jump in middle, If B does that, continue playing from outside, smashing B against the wall. Most likely B will survive, but W would have managed meanwhile building strength al around. But in order this strategy to work it has to be aplied soon enough so B can't create footholds, like G10.]
;B[gm]
(;W[hl]C[R: not bad locally, but on the board the approach on the right top corner cries out loud.]
;B[hm];W[io]TR[jq][fq]C[R: too high. B can easily slip under]
;B[hi];W[gh];B[il]TR[hh]C[R: B just missed a good oportunity to ruin the W wall. The 2 W stones captured are something, but continuing on demolishing W wall would have been better]
;W[nq]TR[nd]C[R: good move. It applies exactky what I've said: play against the wall. But this move is not particularly as good as triangle because it is somehow in the direction of W wall on bottom. It looks more like an extension than playing away from wall.]
;B[lp]
(;W[kq]TR[nq]C[R: This move suffers because:
- it doesn't connect / work with the triangle stone, but invites B to cut
- it doesn't play against the wall, reducing it's value
- it doesn't object the B building up a wall in center];B[lq]
C[R: and B cuts];W[kp];B[lo]TR[ko]C[R: usually B should have bend over W, but in this situation I suppose safety is productive]
;W[ko];B[kn];W[jn];B[km];W[hn]TR[nd]SQ[nq]C[R: W doesn't need it. The square stone is a tempting aji in B moyo, but to put it at work W could start with ... triangle of course]
;B[kr];W[jr];B[lr];W[iq];B[np]C[R: B keeps the safety first]
(;W[ic]C[R: nooooooo. It is so pathetic close to the wall! I would say this move is loosing game move.
A wall has to be used not of itself, building some teritorry along, but as a menace to the opponent, building power in opposite sides permanently threatening to bang the enemy stones in the wall. Extensions, like this, are made starting from small groups, 2-3 stones, or in direction of the wall, like O3. Compare the most usual continuation from this point with the alternative]
(;B[mc];W[kb]C[R: it is low. Play low when creating living shapes. It is not the case.]
;B[lb]
(;W[kd]C[R: Bad shape. Better walk up.];B[ka]
(;W[ja]TR[ic]C[R: wrong closing. When anyway you have to connect to close, and this would not be neccessary because triangled stone, give up one point for sente]
;B[kc];W[la]C[R: B tricked W. Should have get out of atari]
;B[jb]
(;W[jc];B[ka];W[ia];B[kb];W[ld]TR[kg][pf][pj][qn]C[R: too local. W should have extend further.]
;B[ib]
(;W[hb];B[ha];W[ga]C[R: see previous comment: one point for sente when blocker stone in the path]
;B[ia];W[gc];B[md];W[me]TR[lf]C[R: usually a good shape from 2 stones group is 2 lines extension. This one is not flexibile, nor bold]
;B[ne];W[mf];B[nf];W[ng]C[R: and now W uses the wall more suitable. Imagine starting O16 and doing these moves]
;B[og]
(;W[mh]CR[ng][mf]C[R: it is third of fourth time I see this kind of connection. This shape is used on the side (theoretic situation see variant). But in the middle it has less power because:
- B has more to gain by peeping
- simple ate is already bending W.];B[nh];W[lg]C[R: W can loose more through KO that B, better to connect solid]
;B[mg];W[mi];B[ng];W[kh];B[nj];W[mj];B[nk];W[mk]C[R: Notice B is one line ahead, That because jumped initially. W should jump also, it is a struggle to get ahead]
;B[ih];W[hh];B[ii];W[jj]C[R: some local moves, but W should try invade immediately B moyo on right. Later will be impossible]
;B[ig];W[ij];B[hj];W[ji]C[R: not needed];B[ie];W[je];B[id];W[jd]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[jf];W[kf];B[ml];W[ll];B[mm];W[kl];B[lm];W[jm]
C[R: still W misses the invasion, B closed the door. Now it would be quite hard to do it, but not impossible]
;B[jl];W[kk];B[lc];W[le]C[R: why? totally redundant, consuming one point of W teritorry]
;B[gf];W[gg];B[hg];W[fg];B[gd];W[fd];B[fe];W[da];B[ba];W[im]
;B[cq];W[cp]TR[cm]SQ[iq]C[R: the other direction. As rule: play on the direction where the extension is larger. Triangle is much closer than rectangle]

;W[rs]C[Hal: I realized I had no chance of winning at this point and was looking for a place to resign.]
;B[qs];W[rq];B[rr]C[R: The game was lost at strategical level, although our ranks, mine and yours, prevent us to think too much on that level. But still, failure to use the left hand wall and the bottom wall, failure to invade the right side (still possible), failure to drive B while building power led to this result. 
The most important is to detect in this game the pattern of the wall. ANd this games shows 2 techniques (extension in direction of the wall and playing away from wall) which weren't applied. But now I trust you'll see easily these kind of situations.
Look on internet after how to use the walls in go. A good starting point can be http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayAwayFromThickness. Just try to apply stubbornly some rules. Of course, initially it will be clumsy and most likely many games will be lost, but hey, as Edisson said, there weren't 99 failures, but 99 ways hot to not obtain a bulb.
Although there are some little clumsy local moves, I believe dealing with local situations is not a problem for you. Try experiment in GO, based on some readings, and probably you'll discover even more joyful places.
