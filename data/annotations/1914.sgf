C[Thanks for reviewing my game. I had Black. I thought my opponent was leaving weak groups that I could attack, but I'm the one who resigned, so I must have been doing something wrong. As near as I can tell, I was 15 or 20 behind by move 120, and in my desperate attempts to close the gap, I played too aggressively and too thinly. All advice appreciated! Thanks,  - Mike Malveaux

You are welcome.

I think you played well up to a certain point in the game. Though you made some things more complicated as they should be and played too agressively.

In the end, you lost oversight. If you are ahead, you must stay COOL and get home the games as easily as possible.]

(;W[po]C[Not so good.];B[pn];W[oo];B[qp];W[qq]C[This Joseki is from an Kakara against 4-4. Here, it is inferior for White.]

(;B[qj]C[Maybe OK. But I'd play one field closer.]
(;W[mq];B[nc]
(;W[qg]C[Thin. Too thin here.]
(;B[jc]C[Maybe OK. But I'd prefer one point higher, since White is so thin in the upper right.]
;W[cn];B[fq]C[OK.]
(;W[ck]C[Too narrow.]
(;B[qc]C[Maybe this is not the right time. You could use your oppenets narrow move and extend in a double wing.]
;W[cf]C[White must finish the upper right corner first.]
(;B[dh]C[Why so complicated? Simply protect your corner.]
(;W[fc]C[You both like complicated stuff!];B[df]C[Good.];W[cc]
;B[dc]C[Good.];W[cd]
(;B[cg]C[Looks strange, but I find no reason against it.];W[bf]

(;B[bg]C[Way too slow and small!];W[fe];B[de];W[cb];B[db];W[ce]

(;B[ie]C[Looks good. But you can also guide White a bit more.]
;W[eg];B[dg];W[hf]C[White is playing around aimlessly.]
(;B[fb]C[Definitely not.   You must enclose the White stones or push them into the right direction.]
;W[hc]C[Now White gets closer to your prospective territory on the right, secures himself and can still evade down.]
;B[gd]C[There is no sense in taking away eyes of a group, which can easily evade. However, if you did this to connect your stones, you failed later.]

(;W[fd]C[But this is not the way to go.]
(;B[hd]C[Did you check all other moves?];W[gc]C[Separates your stones.]

(;B[fi]C[Too late. Now you should care about your territory.]
;W[ic]
(;B[id]C[It is time to give up the two stones and save your territory.]
;W[jb];B[kc];W[kb]
(;B[lb]C[Another mistake. Making things tough for yourself.]
;W[lc];B[ld]C[You probably saw at this point that you had to give in.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[mb];B[nb];W[la];B[qd]C[Since you have some cutting points, the White stones can now evade.]
;W[pe];B[og]C[Too loosely.];W[qe];B[pc];W[ne];B[nd];W[nf];B[pf]
C[Again. You need not destroy eyes, when the group can escape.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[qf];B[nh];W[qi]C[Aji Keshi. Makes Back stronger, and destroys the cutting point at Q11. White should evade first.]

(;B[bm]C[Since you have now a cut off group around P12, you cannot cut White and fight.

I thinks this move leads nowhere. Make profit instead.];W[bp]
C[Good.];B[cl];W[cq]C[Good.];B[dl];W[dq]C[A complete success for White. You secured your top group and gained 20 points of territory, but Whte took your corner and and secured his group.]

(;W[om]C[Taking it too far. There are larger and better moves.]
;B[rq]C[Certainly big. But there are bigger moves.];W[rr];B[sq]
;W[sr];B[ro]C[Too small. You only play this, if your group is in danger.]
;W[ki]
(;B[kj]C[Tough. It is easier to play one stone closer to the group.]
;W[lj]C[Starts a dangerous fight, for both sides.];B[li]
(;W[mi]C[That is not optimal. In a crosscut, think about extending first!]

(;B[if]C[Chasing ghosts. White is OK by now.

Since Black is ahead, he should get the game home.]
(;W[ig]C[Again too small.];B[hg]C[Black seems to chasing White, but White is out of problems.]
;W[ih];B[jj]C[Finally. But Black gave White strenght and points.]

This is certainly bigger. However, there are also large moves elsewhere!]
