C[Hi Reviewer,

This game I played Black . I'm 8k* in IGS . I lose 5.5 pts.
for komi 5.5 pts. but I don't what's the mistake . I want to know for my improvement.
                                Thank you
                                    Sara

Hi sara,
as far as I can see, black wins this game by 6.5 points. It looks as if you lost by counting the wrong way... Since this is not the official IGS game record, but you probably saved the file from your client, I can't tell what went wrong. If the game is still stored on IGS, you might want to get that file and check the scoring.]

So far everything in this game went as one would expect.];W[hq]
;B[cq]C[*schorsch*:
If w pincers, then b usually wants to walk out with F5. W will be very happy if he can enclose b in the corner.]
;W[eq];B[er];W[fp];B[fr]C[*schorsch*:
B F2 may be too peaceful here, now that b confined to the corner. G3 prepares the possibility to cut at H4 later, which would make a huge difference to the rest of the game.]
;W[gp];B[qn];W[nq];B[oq];W[np];B[or]C[*schorsch*:
Although b P2 secures the corner beyond any doubt, it is rather an end game move. Just imagine what happens to the rest of the game when you play C11 instead. W is absolutely right to go there next!]
;W[ci];B[kc];W[qf];B[rd];W[ql]C[*schorsch*:
Note that b has a living group in every corner, while w is just about to build a huge center mojo. The next few moves by b actually help w to enclose that mojo more securely, taking only little profit at the same time. An interesting approach in this situation might be to just place a b stone in the center of the board, possibly somewhere around J8.

Right now, b has some secure territory, while w has built a lot of influence towards the center. W doesn't have any secure territory yet, so that b only needs to prevent him from taking any to win the  game! In practise this is of course not quite as simple, but it's a thought to guide any further plans.]

C4 would be more robust for w here.];B[cp];W[co];B[bq];W[eg]
C[*schorsch*:
It's becoming more and more difficult for b to reach the lower left area of the board. The b corner group doesn't really participate in the game anymore.]

C[*schorsch*:
If w doesn't defend this cut, but plays around L9 instead, then the game would become much more difficult for b.]

K10 might be one of the biggest moves for b right now.];B[hb]
C[*schorsch*:
It looks like H17 would be more interesting here for b. The w answer at H17 offers a convenient possibility to build a second eye, which is more difficult if b plays there right away.]

;W[ki]C[*schorsch*:
Connecting the ponnuki is probably the strongest move here. The w invasion stones are so loose, that most of them should be easy to kill then.]

;B[qm];W[rk];B[qo];W[mk];B[ml];W[jm];B[im];W[in];B[kr]C[*schorsch*:
B wants to play J2 here instead. Of course, only after carefully counting all the liberties and potential cuts, but I can't see why it wouldn't work.]
;W[jr]C[*schorsch*:
B could try to play N5 now, in combination with  M6. This opens several possibilities against either the L7 or the O3 group. To the very least, b should be able to connect one of the two stones, which would be quite a good result.]
;B[si]C[*schorsch*:
W could just play T12 here and capture the b stone.];W[ri];B[qj]
;W[rj];B[sl];W[rl];B[ag];W[ah];B[af];W[bi];B[mm]C[*schorsch*:
Playing N10 and P13 instead would bring more points, and take the danger out of the cut at P15. The move played is sente, but letting w play the alternative positions later is expensive.]

Now is the last moment for b to play P13.];B[mq]C[*schorsch*:
K19 has been waiting for quite some time now. This move is sente of w doesn't want to defend against F19, which is worth at least 3 points. The move played is gote and only worth one point.]

[fn][fm][gl][gm]C[*schorsch*:
For b, there are two obvious things to improve, besides the counting:
After the fuseki, seeing where the game is heading is very important. If you're ahead, then you can easily invade the white mojo, without really risking a lot.
The other thing is seeing the right endgame moves and to play them in the right sequence. This is more important than it seems, because every single move may look small anyway. But if you calculate the exact values of playing sente or gote moves, then you can improve your result by at least 10 points, which is a lot.

Have fun!
