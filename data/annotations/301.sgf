C[frakt:  K16 is not a  bad move, but typically a corner enclosure precedes a side extension.  For  example, 'a', or 'b'.]

(;W[gp]C[frakt:  G4 is a bit slow.   With the 4-4 stone, a large side extension is the most efficient move, here  a san ren sei (three star points on one side) would be ideal.  Another  possibility is making an approach move to R4.  See variations.]
;B[jp];W[gc]C[frakt:  Again, G17 is not the biggest move, D10 is large and so  is P4/P3.]
;B[ge];W[df]C[frakt:  D14 is quite submissive.  Plus  the corner at C17 is open still after 3 moves in this area.  I suggest move  positive moves like D10, P4, P3, even Q10.]
;B[nc];W[oq]C[frakt:  P3  is a good idea, but slightly late.  Black has K4 stone in place so P3 can be  made heavy and attacked.]

;B[qo]C[frakt:  R5 should be at Q7.];W[po];B[qn]C[frakt:  R6 should be at Q7]
;W[ol];B[ql]C[frakt:  Why  is black settling for 3rd line territory?]
(;W[ln]C[frakt:  M6 is an  attack in the wrong direction.  You want to push K4 toward your strong wall  at P3 and, in the process, aim to make territory on the left side.  See  variation.]
;B[pm]
(;W[jn]C[frakt:  White has yet another chance  to do it right!  See variation.]
;B[hp];W[io]C[frakt:  J5 is  weak.  It should be at G5 or maybe H5.  White seems to want black to run to  the left and ruin white's hopes there.  If black ruins the left, white will  lose the game.  Do not expect to kill your oponent's stones.  Assume they  will live and attack in such a way as to reap maximum profit while your  oponent runs away or makes a small life.  I think white assumed he could kill  black and thereby lost the game.]

;B[kr];W[ks];B[ls];W[mr];B[er]C[frakt:  The game is over now.  Black has the lead  in territory and white has little hope of making much.  The keys to the loss  were:

1.  Slow opening moves (G17, G4, D14) which could have been used to make a  large framework quickly by playing at D10, P4, P3 early on.

2.  Attacking in the wrong direction with M6 and K6.

3.  Assuming you could kill oponent's stones at K4.  When oponent lived, all  prospects for territory were ruined.    I will make a few comments later but really the game is already over for  white.]

;B[dm];W[fk];B[di];W[ei];B[dj];W[el];B[em];W[dk]C[frakt:  Black can just play conservative here.   He is ahead by over 100 points.]

;B[hb];W[gd];B[he];W[ih];B[jh];W[ig];B[if];W[hf]C[frakt:   The game is as good as lost, why doesn't white invade the right side?  There  is nothing to lose and if black makes a huge error, white might get lucky and  pull within 50 points.  Why play 1 point moves when you are behind by 100?   Look at it as an oportunity to practice invasion.]

;B[dl];W[ek];B[cd];W[cf];B[ag];W[ga];B[ha];W[gb];B[hc];W[ea];B[ca]C[frakt:  Black's wall around the  right gets stronger and strgoner, making invasion impossible.  When behind,  invade early!]

(;W[iq];B[no];W[oo];B[jn];W[hn];B[jl];W[hl];B[jj];W[dk]C[frakt:  This is the flavor of what I mean.  Make a large  framework on the left.  This is the proper way to use the wall at P3.  The  specific moves are not essential to follow, but the idea is crucial in this  game.]
