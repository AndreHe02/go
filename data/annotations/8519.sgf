C[forfun (hereafter ff) - First of all, thanks for providing an interesting game to review. Both sides fought hard and it was not until quite late in the game that the issue was decided. I felt that the most interesting issue in this game was the situation in the lower right corner and the bottom side. There was more aji there than either player was able to find during the game. I have tried to indicate some of that. If there were one point I would make for Black, I think I would say to work at appreciating your own potential and building on it. Relatively, Black is strong at pressuring the opponent and reducing their areas. However, I felt from this game that Black is sometimes underestimating the opportunities that have developed in Black's own positions.

Thanks again and good luck! :-)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[cc];B[qk]
;W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fq]LB[jp:A]C[I was also thinking about playing 'A'. Better?

ff - The approach played in the game is normal and I think you take a more positive view this way.]
;W[po]C[ff - Normal would be to answer Black in the lower left. Pros have continued as White in this position both by extending on the left side and by pincering on the bottom. Actually there is no case in my database (GoGoD) of White ignoring F3 in order to play Q5. Once White does so, you should put a high priority on gaining sente in order to play a double-approach in the lower left.

White's Q5 is a typical idea in the Chinese fuseki, but if we look across the whole board, White is in danger of letting Black gain a space advantage overall. The four White stones at the top are all low. Even if White adds another, it can not raise the overall position very much. If Black can set the pace in the bottom left, White could be in trouble.]
;B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[or]LB[rr:A]C['A' would be probably more severe on the white group but I did not want to leave a weakness behind on the bottom.

ff - It is not possible to play Go without some weaknesses. The art is really in playing your weaknesses well rather than avoiding them altogether. :-) See the variation...]
;W[qm];B[ol]C[Threatening to close White in.

I have to call this a mistake in direction. Right now the bottom and the lower left are more urgent than the upper right. Black wants to play here from below. See the previous variation...]
;W[nn]C[ff - White should probably attach at O5.];B[on]C[ff - Good way to take advantage of White's last play.]
;W[oo];B[no];W[om]
(;B[mn]C[ff - This is a basic tactical mistake. The correct play in all such situations is the other atari at O7. See your variation...]
;W[nm]C[ff - Black has gained some influence on the bottom but the shape here is not particularly good. Black's two stones on the right side are loose and subject to attack. N7 remains a big point but if Black plays there, he just drives White over the top of the P8 stone.]
;B[cn]LB[cn:E][dn:D][fo:B][ip:C][dr:A]TR[mn][no][np][or]C[I got some nice strength on the bottom from attacking White on the right.
Allthough I was not totally sure how to use it properly.
I was also considering moves 'A' to 'D'.
My opinion about these moves:
A - not making right use of second move in the corner, also to low
B - bottom seemed to open afterwards and it seemed like making territory using thickness
C - also making territory with thickness, to close to the wall, bottoms seems overconcentrated
D - double approach pressures White most, if he leans on the left and pincers on the bottom after that, I can fight back because of my thickness; here I don't know the specific differences between playing the high and the low double approach, I finally picked 'E' because it is more familiar to me

ff - It is not a simple choice. After this play, White E5 looks very natural and when White fillowed with G4 in the game, I thought Black should be disappointed. Part of the problem here is that Black did not wrap around Whites' stones in the lower right. The White stone on O7 is positioned to potentially hurt Black in the future and Black's two stones at P8 and R9 look thin. That is why N6 was a mistake (O7 would have been better). Black is in danger of achieving too little on the bottom. I might play at B (F5) here. Either you bend around at D6 next or enclose the bottom on a fairly large scale. However E is always a powerful play in the bottom left. It can seldom be completely wrong! :-)]
;W[eo]
(;B[cq]C[ff - Natural, but I think that this is inconsistent with Black's wall.]
;W[gp]C[ff - This is painful. I think that Black has to be rather dissatisfied with the way things have developed in the lower left.]
;B[cp]C[I think the result is good for Black, White cannot use the influence he got in a nice way.

ff - Since White played away from the bottom left, it is natural that Black's result there is good locally. However, White's descent at G3 is natural and means Black has gained almost nothing on the bottom. Overall, Black should not be too happy.]
;W[gq]
(;B[er]LB[jp:A]C[I was also thinking about a move around 'A' so that White won't make a base.
But I thought that even with a small extension I can robb it.

ff - Your choice was natural. A play around K4 would be too close to your right side. Also, allowing White to grab your F3 stone would make it too easy in the lower left.]
(;W[kp]C[I was kind of happy. White made an extension, even a very loose one.
I thought taking away the base making some territory my own can't be wrong.

ff - Let's see. In the game neither White nor Black seemed to consider the potential of this play. Unfortunately Black's wall has a weak point at N5.]
;B[iq];W[ip];B[gr]
(;W[jq]C[ff - This looks like a normal shape play but Black has a good response with H3. What if White cuts on the right instead? See the variation...]
;B[hq];W[hp]C[White got some influence, but It seemed kind of worthless.

ff - Agreed, White has played too passively and missed some chances here.]
;B[lo]C[ff - White played too passively in reaction to Black. When Black fixes this weakness, White's bottom-side stones become subject to attack. Black has outplayed White in this area.]
(;W[mq]C[ff - A slow play by White. It aims at O3, a vital point in this shape, but at this time it allows Black to seize the initiative.]
;B[jn]C[ff - Black is correct to ignore White's last.];W[gn]
;B[jo];W[jr];B[hr];W[jp];B[dm]LB[dd:E][de:D][df:C][pi:F][gn:A]
[jn:B]C[Now I had quite a hard time finding the right move.
My A-group seemed out to the center and so safe for the moment.
The B-group seemed also quite ok, but not totally alive.
I thought threatening to close in would be appropriate. It also prepares for an extension on the left.
Would it have been better to approach top left? (C-E)
Or maybe even better taking territory, making it hard for White to catch up? (F)

ff - D7 was a good choice. Black could not tolerate having White play there instead and push down Black's left-side position. White's bottom side stones are still subject to attack and when White answers this play immediately, it becomes sente for Black.]
;W[gl]
(;B[ml]C[This move is to prevent White from pushing out in the center and cut off my bottom right group.

ff - The idea is good but the play chosen has too many weaknesses perhaps. See the variation...]
(;W[pg]C[This move felt a bit aggressive. I know it aims to get some strength, looking to cut through on the right. What is the best reply?

ff - First of all, it seems to me that White lets Black off too easily here. Black's last play does not really prevent White from moving out. See the variation for White...]
(;B[qg]C[ff - To me this looks fundamentally too passive. No matter what, Black wants to play up. However, basically any hane, whether underneath or on top, allows White to cut or to use the threat of cutting. So even when the hane looks strong, often extending solidly is stronger because it limits White's counterplay. See the variation...]
;W[qh]
(;B[qf]C[ff - Passive again.]
(;W[pi]C[ff - White should have left Q13 and R12 as forcing moves and played O8 or Q8 next. Black gets a break here and is able to patch things together somewhat.]
(;B[nl]C[Fixing my weaknesses, making sure White cannot fight back on my bottom right group.
After this i was aiming to attack White.];W[pl];B[pk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[og]C[ff - Now White has created a potentially heavy group while forcing Black to fix weaknesses in his bottom stones.]
;B[nd];W[mc]
(;B[mf]C[ff - This is an attempt to kill White. Why do we say that? There is no second purpose to this play. The top is solid for White, so if the White stones on the right live, this play by Black will have little or no value.]
;W[mi];B[ki]C[Hard for me to find a right move here.

ff - This is reasonable. Black is very strong below.];W[lh]
(;B[kh]C[ff - A heavy play.];W[lg]C[I'm not sure which move to continue locally and White seemed pretty much out to me.  So I thought it is maybe best to approach the last corner.]
;B[df]LB[dd:A][de:B][cf:C]C[A to C better?

ff - This is natural and good here.];W[lf]C[ff - Very slow. White is too worried here.]
(;B[ec]C[ff - This is questionable in terms of the overall position. White's only weak stones are coming out the bottom side. Black would like to create an area on the left and challenge White to reduce it. At the top both C17 and L17 are low. It is difficult for White to make territory.]
;W[ed];B[fd];W[ee];B[dc];W[ce]

(;W[gi]C[ff - See the variations for White...];B[hi];W[gj]C[ff - White never gets time to make territory here. Black keeps the pressure on. So White suffers a loss in the center with no compensation here.]
