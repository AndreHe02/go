AB[pd][dp]C[I would like comments about how to avoid some of my worst mistakes. I generally felt in control of the game as white but felt I should have been able to take better advantage of black's errors.  The game is unfinished because my recording device lost battery power.  White won this game by about 13 points.

Hi, I'm your reviewer LibraryEx 3k. generally if you can win by 13 points you should be quite comfortable throughout the game, so I don't really expect any major mistakes from you =)]
PL[W];W[qq]C[I've been experimenting with the 3-3 lately.

If it suits you. Personally I feel it should be avoided as mush as possible, since its too slow for my liking, and especially in this case where you are already 2 stones behind.]
;B[qn];W[po]C[Not sure if this is standard, but...I figured it put pressure on the black stone and gave me an opportunity at a big side extension.

since the 3-3 is secure, you'll want to put as much pressure as you can on the black stone. you're right: by attacking the lone black stone, you gain should gain an advantage]
;B[ql]C[lol. tiny extension. bad for black];W[qf];B[nc]
(;W[qi]C[I'm trying to keep black's group weak here.

premature. black can attack from the corner and weaken your group too.]

(;B[ol];W[cc];B[dd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ce];B[fc];W[jd]C[Was this wrong?  Was there a bigger point on the board?

It feels more like a preventive measure than an actual useful move. Imagine if black played there, he'd have a huge top side. HOWEVER, bear in mind that you dont stand to actually gain anything much from it. I would prefer something like s16 to reduce black's corner in sente and strengthen the R14 group at the same time. F3 is also an option since it aims at working with the Q5 extension.]

what's this?];W[mb];B[nb];W[la];B[na];W[kb]C[In retrospect, not sure how to use my big wall.

be patient. by attack the Q7 group from somewhere like P11, soon you will find that the O14 group is in great danger too.]
;B[ni];W[mh]C[looks weird. i would prefer something like O10 contact play to keep the groups seperated at all costs]
;B[nh]C[good move by black, even though it was obvious. this is why the n12 was dubious, it practically invites black to play O12]
;W[mg];B[ng];W[mf];B[me];W[lj]C[Gosh, this move made me feel like I have a weak and bumbling group. I was concerned.

the N12 group IS weak. this move is fine =)];B[ld];W[dn];B[dk]
;W[cp];B[cq];W[co];B[gp]C[Oh boy...I think just drove that group right toward the side I should have extended to.

common mistake: squeezing the toothpaste. essentially you are just forcing black out and ending up with a mess.]

I notice you are good at spotting weak shapes like the elephant's eye. however, note that the "weakness" is simply that the opponent can divide the 2 stones. if both are in no danger, playing at the eye like the E13 move serves no purpose other than to give you another weak bunch of stones to worry about. also, try not to get too caught up in the game. there were many chances for you to kill black's weak groups, but due to a lack of calculation / responding to less valuable moves, you wasted those chances.

I guess thats about it. cheers!])
