C[Hello, 

My name is Rogerio (Rogerio at Dashn, whiter at KGS and dayafter at IGS) 

I am around 5-7k 

I will be your reviewer today :) 

any time you see a "R>" it is me trying to give you some of my very limited knoledge ;) 

Have fun];B[pp]C[Phlegmatic [16k\]: hi good luck, and have fun]
;W[pd]C[morpion [17k?\]: yeah :)];B[dp];W[cd];B[ed];W[df];B[dc]
C[R> The joseki move is C17, this way if white C17 he gets a full corner and almost sente - since a oincer at H17 is really severe on black then (see variation)]

(;W[qn]C[R> I think putting pressure on black's stones at or around H17 is more severe, but this is a big point too.]
;B[nq];W[rp]C[R> In pro games we don't see much of S4 any more... it seems to limit ones options, but it IS joseki. PLUS it is a big point and in sente. 

What pros are doing is the exchange R6, O3, Q10 (it looks as if white makes a nice bridge securing the side, but it also has many defects)]
;B[qq];W[pk]C[R> Nice, now black has to come up with a good response here. 

When judging where to play next one thing has to come into mind: What is urgent? 

This is many times VERY dificult. And many pros disagree on what is Urgent in a position. 

BUT in positions like this it gets rather easy: 

Let´s look at the groups on the board: 

White:
1- Has the group at C16-D14 it is somewhat secure since it has a nice "horse move" extension. It is very easily defendable. 

2- Has the Q16 stone witch in itself is secure and is working very well with the stone at Q9. 

3- The group at the bottom right corner is very safe and Q9 is playing a BIG role on getting moyo with Q16. 


Black: 
1- D4 is secure 

2- O3 and the rest of this group are safe, but contrary to white this group is yet a bit too far from the hoshi (star point) stone. This means that in the hole board fight the white stones are better, even if this IS joseki. A move at K4 would make all this go away, and make black the best overall, but that means to sacrifice sente... 

3- The group at D17-E16 (as I said earlier) is not the best placement  for these stones, they are too passive, and make C17 a real threat on their lives, AND they are in desperate need to  make an extension so white doesn't K16-17 and make a HUGE moyo. 

Black has 2 options: K4 or K16-17.  So witch one he must choose? K4 clearly is territory oriented. K16 has the advantage of making a base for his u´pper group while taking away the oponent's extension. When playing generaly go for the multipurpose plays.]
;B[nc]C[R> Good idea!  But it is exactly what white wanted ... 

This way you are practicaly begging for a high two space pincer at L16 ... and white makes a pincer and also an attack at D17-E16]
;W[ld]C[R> As I said I think one space to the left would put even MORE pressure on Black. The 2 space makes BIG influence countered by BIG territory for Black... but influence is what white is looking for to attack the 2 lonely left-upoper stones.]
;B[nf]C[is O15 better or too slow ?
or Maybe Q 14 ?

R> Q14 is a mistake, black gets cut, O15 is joseki and O14 is not... (see variation)]

(;W[pf]C[R> Well white should have been MUCH MORE agressive here. This is like patting Black on the shoulder and saying: "there, there, try it again " ... the trouble with a weak response like this is Black deciding to play K16 now... making his stones good again on the left and pressuring by his turn the K16 stone now.]
;B[jd]C[R> Ouch! How I hate to be right];W[lf];B[oh]C[R> OVERPLAY!!!!!!! With hundreds of cutting points like the one Black has he should be woried in making life for them O line stones. now Black is the one saying "cut me, cut me, oh please cut me, pretty please? with cherry on top?" 

White should O16 and take the loot! 

For black Q18 is not a bad play, and then (maybe Q17 could fix the shape]
;W[ph]C[R> Come on White !!! where are your balls???? Nice territory move and all but, WHY NOT KILL THE BASTARD?? 
O16 and he was a gonner, now he just fixes his position with P14 and you White still has to try to mke something of the M line stones.]
;B[jf]C[R> Another present Black?];W[oi];B[nh];W[nd]C[R> Finally!!!]
;B[md]C[i don't know if it was the better choice for black...

R> Doesn't matter, M16 and Q16 will connect if they don't kill O17]
;W[me];B[mc]C[maybe P16 is better];W[ne]C[R> M17 would be better.]
;B[lc];W[dn];B[fq]C[R> Nice and solid, but it seems too low ... O3 is already low so F4 is more recomended.]
;W[dj];B[jp]C[R> White is racing for big points all over the board, black should start getting some of his own or this one is going to be over very fast. K4 was the first. 


Oh and by the way, those 3 little stones surrounded by Whites? Let him have them. If possible use the sacrifice to make territory.]
;W[pc]C[R> ???? How much territory does White make here? 5, 6 points difference from what would happen if black played it? That is two few on a game of big moyos like this one. It is a great yose (end game)  move, but it is very bad now. 

Moves white should think about: 

O6
M12
F6
F14];B[ni]C[or N12 -> Better Shape

R> None of the above, these 2 stones are just pocket change. 

Moves Black should think here: 

P6
F14
C5];W[oj];B[co];W[cn]C[Phlegmatic [16k\]: that was big - i wanted to play c4 next...

R> Right you are.];B[cq]C[R> B5 would do the same thing and it was sente.]
;W[do];B[bo];W[bn];B[ff]C[R> Now it is black's turn to take the big points... see what sente can do to you?]
;W[jh]C[morpion [17k?\]: i wonder if it was better to play L12 before f14 ?
Phlegmatic [16k\]: maybe, depends on your plan
Phlegmatic [16k\]: i could play G16 or similar if you did
morpion [17k?\]: yep but my stones near O12 are not strong enough
Phlegmatic [16k\]: i hoped you wouldn't notice ;-)


R> F14 is better than L12. G16? No way in hell G16 lives. 
But K12 is VERY BAD, first of all you make black WANT to cut at L13, making his ugly, good for nothing O12 stones come into play again. L12 is better  for White, and M9 seems the best.]
;B[mk];W[nn]C[R> What is this for? Put some pressure on Black, cut even with P10.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[on];W[nm];B[qo];W[qm];B[ol];W[om];B[nl];W[oo]

Good fighting game. 

Balck made some mistakes, but in the end White made the biggest one of them. 

Hope this is usefull for your future studies.
