C[ufo: hi, im your reviewer. 

During this game a lot of technical mistakes happen. It might be worth to study some tesuji.

on the strategical level, play away from thickness is the most important lesson.

(;B[ae];W[bc];B[dj]C[ufo: The result of both invasions is bad for B. B is unreasonable. The bottom corner makes black 10 points. The wall is worth much more. Not directly to be calculated in points of territory. It does not mean that a territory bigger than 10 points will form in front of it, but that because of its influence, and thus it''s assistance in fighting, will gain W more than 10 points in the end.

The extension to D10 isn't very interesting because the bottom has already been determined and white has a strong stone sticking out on the third line which will later probably hurt the black group, as well limits its possibilities for development..]
;W[cg]TR[bf]C[ufo: This is a mistake. The marked stone only has one liberty. The black stones cannot possibly be cut, and are thus quite strong, especially with their support on D10

We could say that because of the two strong white positions on both of the left corners, the left side is actually quite small and uninteresting. That counts as well for white's next move.]

(;B[ih]C[ufo: B now has a weak group between two weak groups, which is good, because everytime B strengtens its group, it weakens 2 groups at once... so, 1+1 is?]
;W[hi];B[gc]C[ufo: Thanks to this whole sequence the white corner now dies. See var. at move 57.]
;W[di]
(;B[bj]LB[bi:B][ck:A]C[ufo: the reason to play a tiger mouth is to protect against two cuts. Its disadvantage is the kikashi at A. There is no cut at B, so it is better to connect solidly.]

;B[jd];W[op]C[ufo: the wall is gigantic, so is the upper left corner but black needs to add a move. I think that W is leading.]
;B[kq]C[ufo: black has to do something here. The thickness is enormous, but the black stone has room to survive, and then white still has not so much effective points on the board.]
(;W[qo]LB[pn:C]C[ufo: I don't like this move. attachment is a defensive move. You are very strong all over the board. Keep B separated and weak. Play something C. It attacks the corner as well as the side.]

(;W[np]C[ufo: thank you move. At least you have to play like in the variation.]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[mq];W[jh]LB[pe:A]C[ufo: this is a mistake. The stone is neglectable. It doesn't cut anything. Forget about stones that are stuck to a strong wall. They will die naturally. Play at A instead.]
;B[qe]C[ufo: good];W[hm]LB[ph:A]C[ufo: play away from thickness
http://senseis.xmp.net/?PlayAwayFromThickness

This move doesn't seem to change the game position very much at all. Whether it is there or not, doesn't make a big difference to the game. compare with a stone around A]

;W[pk]LB[ph:B][pi:A]C[ufo: again a bit close];B[mc]LB[qh:A]
C[good, but I would go for A first, because the top is quite hard for W to come in I think, especially as A would make it even harder.]

;B[or]LB[qf:A]C[ufo: black has this very nice tesuji though, which is hard to cut from the side, and if w cuts it from the corner, black settles easily and the corner is rather small. Both players also want to get a stone near A first.]
))
(;B[dl]LB[if:B][kg:C][cl:A]C[ufo: better basic principle connect and cut. It is true that it is usually not fruitful to cut two living groups, but compared to A this has much better prospects in undermining the influence of the wall, and reducing the center.  Better to play tenuki i think.  

There is an unsettled situation going on in the centre. You each have a weak group there. Whoever plays there first has an advantage. It is hard to say what would be the best move, but you could try things like B or C.]
