C[allan: b looks ok to me, so far :)
(Please note that i am only 16ish kyu, but at least i can pass on some of the advice i have received from reviewers of my games, in addition to my own, limited, experience)]
;W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[qo];W[qj];B[jd];W[dj];B[qh]C[allan: To me r12 feels a little to far away from q16; I would not like white to play r14 next, so I would probably play r13 instead - but then I am not a fighter...]
;W[qm];B[np]C[allan: b o4 feels too high and too slow to me. It leaves a vacuum around n3 and gives white the opportunity to extend on the bottom.

Basic, three pass, procedure:
1) defend my own weak groups, if any
2) attack opponent's weak groups, if any
3) go for more (potential) territory

b r12 is a weak group, which makes me think that b r14 is more urgent than building on the lower right corner, which is fairly safe (for the moment).

Preferrably 2) and 3) should go hand in hand: make territory while attacking. Along the bottom, b f3 would feel right to do, although w is open to attack anywhere.]
;W[jp];B[fq];W[cq]C[allan: w c3 feels too defensive - with k4 in place, w should be able to attack the black stone on f3 harder, like w e3, or h3 (which would also begin to build some base for the k4 group at the same time)]
;B[dr]C[allan: So b should take advantage of w's defensiveness. b d2 also defends the black group by building a base for it, so it complies to the rule of taking care of your own weak groups, as well.

What I am unsure of, however, is if this should be done right now, since it has more the flavour of a large endgame (or, possibly mid game) point, rather than a game opening one. It is no attack, since white has already c3, so it causes b to lose initiative.

Maybe b j3 would be better to start with, leaving white to worry about preventing d2 later. Attacking k4 at the same time as building a base, seems good (I would like that even better if b o4 had been at o3, or n3, instead - would prevent white from wedging in underneath at n3)

Another option is to invade the left side now, before w is prompted to strengthen the wall around it, making future invasions harder.]
;W[dn]C[allan: This is not what black wants. Compare the (potential) points made by w d6 with what was gained by b d2. If b d2 would have prompted w c3, d2 had been ok, but c3 was already there.]
;B[iq];W[jq];B[ip]C[allan: I would prefer b j2, instead of j4. it:
1) prevents w from cutting into the base of b's j3 group,
2) threatens to take away the base for w's k3 group (and also connect to the lower right corner, especially if o4 had been n3...), which would then definitely be on the run, squeezed by b from both sides.]
;W[io];B[gp]C[allan: I think j2 is more urgent - if white undercuts b j3, he can get a base (and threaten black's) along the bottom. If the object is to preventing w from connecting to the left, it would have to be higher.]
;W[ko]C[allan: I would have expected j2 (or k2) and then n3 from white.]
;B[fd]C[allan: I do not like the prospect of white j2 (or even worse, if white happens to be more insightful than I am), so I would feel that it is too early to leave that area yet. also,  b f17 would be a better attack up left. (and there is still r14)]
;W[ec];B[fc]C[allan: ...so b looses initiative here and has to defend instead]
;W[df]C[allan:...and w can go for more (potential) territory, since the k4 group is not under any severe threat for the moment.
A few more stones, and w's left is going to be uninvadable (at least for me), and that is severe, since black does not yet have any reasonably secured territory, except for maybe at the lower right corner.]
;B[gn]C[allan: This move (b g6) only prompts w to strengthen his left wall or attack the base of b's lower left group.]
;W[nc]C[allan: Well...hrm, come to think of it, he could attack elsewhere, as well :)
Black has enough weak spots to hit.
This is where r14 would have come in handy.];B[mn]C[allan: I am not sure what b is aiming at here, but I have a hard time believing that it could be more important than defending/counterattacking at the top.

If white goes for r14 now, b will have two groups (and a corner) in great danger. I would vote for b r14, or possibly m17 followed by r14.

To attack w's k4 group, b should go for the base, not the top. If you can gain territory by attacking, it is enough to terrify, rather than to kill.

Note: Defensive moves often makes you feel like losing tempo (which could be true, of course), but I usually find myself regretting not having taken the time to fill a few gaps, now and then. One way of feeling a little more efficient is to make an attack, or just throw in a stone somewhere for your opponent to chew on, *then* returning to fill the hole in your own wall. The risk, of course, is if your bait is just ignored, and your hole promptly attacked instead...]
;W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rc];W[lc];B[jc];W[ob];B[oe];W[kb]C[allan: r14 is still a sensitive spot, but white seems more intent on surviving than attacking.]
;B[he]C[allan: To get a good base for a group is important, since it is so much harder to makes eyes in the center than on the edges.

You also lose a lot of points if the opponent is able to slide in under you.

b k18 would feel more urgent to me than h15.
this would prevent w j18, or monkey jumping to h19.
Also, b's group on the right side is far from settled yet; it is so empty inside.
w r14 or r15 or s13 could probably do a lot of damage there.];W[od]C[allan: w p16 induces b to strenghten his wall and destroy w's option to play inside the group. It also gives b the chance to atari p16 and thereby, possibly, build an even greater wall.

(There is a variation in the game record here, uncommented, in which b does atari p16. However, this leads to a multi-ko-thing, which is too complicated for me to analyse, so I leave it uncommented)]
;B[qe];W[ne];B[of];W[nf];B[ng]C[allan: Black's right side is safe now, so it feels more urgent to attend to weaker groups, like the one o top. b p13 or p12 would have been better as a means of separating white's groups, since it does not leave an opportunity for w to cut.]
;W[mg];B[jj]C[allan: I do not understand this move, but I think it looks funny. b has one unsettled group, and w has two; something should be done about them, and also about w's left side.

By the way, I have heard two proverbs about the tengen, (k10):

"The first to play at tengen wins", and
"The first to play at tengen loses"

You figure it out (because I can't :) Maybe the first one applies to Go Seigen, and the other one to us deadly...]
;W[og];B[pg];W[nh];B[oh];W[ng];B[im]C[allan: b p11 to prevent w from connecting would have felt more reasonable here.]
;W[oi];B[pi];W[pj];B[qi];W[nj]C[allan: Now white does not have to worry about the right side group and has a good platform for stomping out any black territory in the center.]
;B[jn]C[allan: You should not get too close when trying to kill a dragon, because dragons are so touchy when it comes to getting killed :)
This move looks like a guy poking his head into the dragon's mouth.
Choke the base first, i think,
or l7 to seal in and to prepare for attack from w's fortress up north.]
;W[kn];B[km]C[allan: I think m7 is better, since it cuts the line between l6 and o10.]
;W[lm];B[ln];W[kl];B[jo]C[allan: If w takes l7, he is out, having the chance of making a considerble dent in black's prospective territory at the bottom.
Better connect at k7.];W[jm];B[in]C[allan: Disaster for black];W[jl]C[allan: I would have expected n3 or n7 from w; build a base, or connect.]
;B[kp];W[lp];B[kq];W[jr];B[lo];W[km];B[kr]C[allan: OK, black got away without so much damage, but that was because w was so nice.]

;W[qq];B[qp];W[pr];B[oq]C[allan: w should not be able to live in the lower right corner (although I am always careful not to be too sure...).
I think s3 kills, instead of p3.];W[rq];B[rp];W[or];B[nr];W[qs];B[os];W
[ps];B[ns]C[allan: w can only get a false eye at p1. b s2 kills.];W[sr]
;B[rr]C[allan: Now it is too late. b would have needed to be able to follow up with s1 or t2 to kill.]
;W[rs];B[sp]C[allan: There are more urgent points elsewhere, like on top, even though black got a lot more territory at the bottom than he deserved.
On the other hand, white got plenty of points above, and the black stone in the middle looks pretty lonesome.
Another possibility is for b to play on c8 followed by c12. That should stir up things a bit.]
;W[sq]C[allan: w t3 not necessary.];B[do]C[allan: I think b will have to invade at left in order to reduce ws' territory enough to have a chance.
This should only reinforce w's wall.
I would try c8 and c12. after a successful split, then this could prove interesting.
