C[buckyyowza:  Hello, comments by Mark Fyffe (bucky on KGS).  I will prefix all comments with "buckyyowza:" and end them  with "---". I hope you enjoy this review and find my comments to be of use.  Please feel free to contact me if you have any further questions about this game.

Often times when attacks seem to go well for your opponent, but not for you, it is the result of a strategy that is too one-sided.  One way or another, you are thinking too much about your opponent's points, and not enough about your own.  Therefore, I will focus this review primarily on how best to defend your groups, and how (and when!) to attack your opponent's.

 In order for an attack to be effective, there must be a few things in place:

- Proper thickness must exist to support the attack, allowing your stones an escape route if the attack should go wrong.
- A proper attack should threaten several areas so that it is up to your opponent to decide which to sacrifice.
- Sequences should be read out to be either very large or to retain sente.

To the reviewer:

Thank you in advance for reviewing my game.  I have no idea where I'm going wrong, but it seems that I keep falling very far behind fairly early in my games.  I try doing the same things that work well for my opponents, but it seems as thought things work every time my opponents try them, the minute I play the same attacks, they suddenly go wrong.  I don't see any reason why Black's play at D15 resulted in Black getting the entire left side, while when I did it, the result was immediately getting a weak group.

As a result, I've lost all confidence in attacking.  Attacking seems to work only for other people, and never for me.  Indeed, I'm beginning to think that if I come up with an idea for an attack, I should reject it immediately, because it must be wrong.  Every single time I attack, it backfires; all my opponents' attacks work brilliantly.

With kind regards,
Ted Schuerzinger (Fedya on KGS)];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dc];B[de]

(;W[fd]LB[dh:A]C[buckyyowza: F16 is a very nice play here, and quite common for players wanting to keep things simple and retain sente.  A pincer attack would not be a good plan at this point because it would give black too much thickness (the primary aim of D15) on the upper side (see var).  After F16, the simplest thing for black to do would be play at D12 (or the sequence leading to... see var on w8), leaving white with sente.

---
Ted: I rejected the pincer attack at C13 largely because any time I try a pincer attack, the result is disaster.  But as a result of my bad luck with attacking, Black ends up getting the entire left side.]
;B[cc]
(;W[db];B[ci]
(;W[ic]LB[cd:B][id:A]TR[cg][dg][dh][qo]C[buckyyowza: actually, the only thing slow about this is that I'd prefer to play it at J16 to aim a little better at R5 (or similar).  For contrast, black is quite over played and has already left a big weakness at C16.  Also, C11 is quite thin and the marked points will be nice for attack a little later on, when white has some more thickness along the lower or right center.  Of course, I prefer to leave weaknesses lie until I need a few points to regain a lead.  For black to give up sente now would be too slow, so white is in a good way for now.

---
Ted: I have a feeling you'll tell me this move is slow, but every time I've played tenuki in a similar situation, Black ends up playing around J17 and putting pressure on the White stones.]
;B[dn];W[fq]LB[fp:A]C[buckyyowza: F3 is too low, should be at F4 to keep to correct pressure on black's left side stones, which are now extremely thin.  A direct pincer here would also be a bad choice because although you would split black's side moyo a bit, you would also end up with quite a difficult lower left corner.  What you will want now is some play around O17 to develop the upper side, and then to play a pincer stone at around D9.  For now, black's left is full of holes and to protect it in gote would be too slow.  If you are patient, the time will come soon.

---
Ted: Again, I didn't play the pincer attack, but this time it has more to do with there not being any place to make eyes with a stone at C8.]
;B[jp]C[buckyyowza: now white get sente, and R5 is an urgent play to prevent black from developing a huge moyo on the right side.]

(;W[po]C[buckyyowza: the problem with Q5 is that black's stone at K4 makes the joseki sequence (see var) too desirable for black. It is better to use a low approach now to either split the corner or settle on the right side.

---
Ted: D15 worked quite well for Black.  I try it and the result is much worse.  I guess attacking is only the right idea for other people.]

(;B[oo]LB[on:A][qq:B]C[buckyyowza: either P6 or R3. P6 is much simpler and would be a better choice in this position because white would get good center thickness.

---
Ted: I didn't know how to respond here.  I guess the way to find out is to try this move against my opponents.  I'm sure they'll have the refutation handy.]

(;W[pn];B[on];W[pl];B[pg];W[nc]LB[nd:A][om:B][qq:C]C[buckyyowza: this is certainly a good area to play.  But again, I would place this stone higher, at O16, to better set up an attack on the left side.  The right side stones have little worry because they can make one eye quite easily and either escape to the center and toward the upper side (i.e P7) or settle in the corner with R3.

---
Ted: I think this is the wrong move.  I should have playes around R10 to make certain I'd get eyes on the right side, give up a large amount of territory by allowing black to take N17, and hope that I can somehow make more territory someplace on the board.  Where that territory would come from, however, is beyond me.]
;B[qj]
(;W[ql]C[buckyyowza: this play intends well, but is too slow at forming eyes.  the variation is a bit better sabaki play.]
;B[rp]LB[om:A]C[buckyyowza: certainly do not avoid or prefer the third line :-)  It is best to retain a balance of third and fourth line plays.  In gerenal, you will want to easily see how to settle your stones from the third line and also how to use your 4th line thickness to attack your opponent's shape. White P7 now is perfect to get all you need to settle or run through the center while create some nice aji around P4 and Q4 to mess up black's greedy plans for the corner.

---
Ted: I've been told that I play too much on the third line, which is another of the reasons I played at Q5 instead of R5.  But the drawback is that I'm not going to get any eyes on the side.  I guess from now on I should play on the third line, make certain I get my eyes, and make stronger players show me that influence is worth something.  Influence and thickness never help me.]
;W[qc]LB[ff:A][om:B]C[buckyyowza: this is not the best time to play R17 because you have a weak group at Q8, and black will choose a joseki that weakens your upper side, making Q8 much harder to escape. Your best play now would probably be F14 to assist Q8 with thickness or P7 to give the Q8 stones a better shape.  In fact, both F14 and P7 are also attacking plays:  F14 aims at a left side invasion, and P7 puts significant pressure on the P6 stones.

---
Ted: I didn't know what to do, so I attacked.

Black has the entire left side, which is bigger than what I had at the top before attacking at R17; Black's bottom right corner is bigger than what I've got on the bottom, and what Black has on the top right is just extra territory.]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[nl]C[buckyyowza: now the Q8 stones in trouble, and white must find a sabaki.]
;W[pj]C[buckyyowza: yes ;-) good plan.  Q10 is a tricky move, consider the variations on the next two moves.

---
Ted: I didn't think I could afford to sacrifice the stones in the lower right, so I decided to try to make two eyes somehow.]

(;B[qi]
(;W[pi]LB[oi:A]C[buckyyowza: should be at P11 to prevent the cut and extend better toward the upper side.]
;B[pk]C[Ted: I didn't see that this move would keep me from connecting all my stones.]
;W[ok];B[qk];W[ol];B[oj];W[nk];B[oi];W[ml];B[nm];W[mj]C[buckyyowza: well done ;-) the proveb says "it is better to run than to live.  you have invaded black's upper right corner and save your weak group on the right.  Now black leads about 20 points, but white's position is settled much better and is in a better fighting position. However, turning N9 into an eye is probably not likely.

---
Ted: I played here because I thought it might help turn N9 into an eye later.]
;B[fi];W[cl]LB[dk:A][el:B]C[buckyyowza: C8 is a good play, although I would have attacked at D9 or E8 to aim more at connect through N10 than the corner. I played with a few variations on black's next move, and seems easy enough to escape the C8 stone and settle F3.  Remeber that white still has C16 if you want to make up some easy points in a hurry. L17/M17 is not a weak spot :-) black might be able to take the points there, but only by running away from the two strong white groups (J17 and O17) and ending in gote.

---
Ted: I played this move out of desperation.  I'm already well behind, with no place to attack, and no idea where I'm going to make up the territory I'm behind.

Never mind that I have a weakness aound L/M17 that Black could attack.]
;B[dl]
(;W[cn];B[cm]
(;W[co]C[buckyyowza: this should be at B7, this gives too much to black.]
;B[bm]C[buckyyowza: now white must play C16 to make up these points. see var on w10]

(;W[mm]LB[lq:A]C[buckyyowza: this group can run and is quite safe for now.  Meanwhile, you have helped black to settle on the lower side.  These stones are practically connected to the upper side, so I would rather use their aji to erase black's lower side moyo by invading at M3. see var for some ideas]
;B[mn];W[kk]C[Ted: Trying to make eye-space for the group in the lower right. (buckyyowza: see w48)]
;B[ge];W[gd];B[fe];W[om];B[nn];W[pp];B[oq];W[rn]C[Ted: I figured this move would help me get another eye for the group on the right.]
;B[ep];W[eq];B[cq]LB[bp:A][dr:B]C[buckyyowza: this invasion cannot succeed.  Usually the 2-4 points (B4 and D2) are all that is needed to stop a 3-3 invasion when you have enough supporting stones.  You _definitely_ have enough supporting stones.

---
Ted: I didn't see this move coming.  I couldn't figure out a way to kill Black in the corner, and as a result made the horrible mistake of getting "thickness" in exchange for territory, something which I know fully well you should never do.]

(;W[cp];B[dq];W[eo];B[fp];W[gp];B[ap]
(;W[dr]LB[bq:A]C[buckyyowza: should be at B3];B[cr];W[er];B[jl]

(;W[fo]LB[bq:A]C[buckyyowza: B3 is still a cut.  Even if black escapes the ladder, you can take the corner in ko (see var). If you played B3 instead of F5,  the C3 stones are captured.

---
Ted: I had to capture: K8 serves as a ladder-breaker.];B[lm]
;W[ll];B[km];W[nj];B[hq];W[fm];B[kl];W[lj];B[mh];W[kj]LB[ie:C]
[ki:B][jj:A]C[buckyyowza: this move may be needed later, but this group can still connect to the upper side, so for now this is a slow gote.  I would prefer this play at K10 or L11, but J15 is your biggest play now.

---
Ted: Was this move necessary?  I was worried about Black playing at M9, and following it with L10, which would turn M9 into a false eye.]
;B[ne]
(;W[ld]LB[cd:B][bq:A][qq:C]C[buckyyowza: Black's corners are all vulnerable, R3 is a nice attack (see var, also var on w92).  Also considering that you still have B3 and C16, the score is not as bad as you may think.  I count that if white plays it right, this can still be a close game, or even a victory for white if you hit all three attacks in sente.  However it is very difficult because you have been too timid and gave away a lot of points to black.

---
Ted: I considered myself lucky that Black never played at L17 or M17.  I knew I was behind; I didn't realize just how far behind I actually was.]

C[buckyyowza: black's moyo here can be erased with J15, or a by using L12 and J10 (double atari aji)., but black still wins at this point by at least 20 points at best.  As there is nothing interesting after this move, I will end my review here.  Although short, this game is quite interesting and challenging to review. Thank you for this opportunity ;-)  In closing, I would like to hit on a couple of points that I think may help you a bit:

- You are not bad at playing in the right part of the board, although your technique is a little underdeveloped. To improve this, you should spend some time working life-death and tesuji problems (goproblems.com is an excellent resource).  It is better to work a few problems quickly every day than to spend hours thinking hard only once.  Also, when you are unhappy with a corner situation, after the game take a moment to look up the joseki (search for joseki on senseis.xmp.net).  Be warned, though, do not try to understand the joseki, just take a quick look at it ;-)

- "It is better to run than to live"  If a group can easily run to a strong group, it is not weak.  This is the purpose of thickness.  You spend many plays trying to find eyes for a weak group when it is more than able to connect to a faraway group.  Try to become more aware of how the groups on the board relate to each other.  This will help you find where to place your attacking stones as well.

Thanks again for the chance to review this game.  You have asked some difficult questions, and I hope my answers make enough sense ;-)  If you have any further questions or would something clarified, please don't hesitate to ask.  Feel free to send me an email or look for bucky on KGS and IGS.]
