C[adum: I'm playing white and I feel like I lost this game mostly strategically. At several points I felt like I outplayed my opponent, but I still came out behind, so I'm obviously not understanding the true implications of my moves.


I'll do my best to help. I'm most interested in the opening and understanding whole board strategy, and so my comments tend to focus on that rather than tactics, endgame, etc.]
;B[pd];W[oq];B[cd];W[cq]C[I don't know if I understand the opening deeply enough to say this is bad period, but I have my doubts about your first couple moves. it's common for black to open with some kind of whole side enclosure - just the first stone at the 4-4 point gives a hint this is coming. white's central problem is often reducing black's stronghold. in this case, though, both your stones are looking away from the upperside - 2 looks to the lowerside and 4 is buried in the corner.]
;B[ic];W[pg]MA[qf]C[this approach aims at the upperside, but I think it ends up making black stronger without gaining much territory or influence for you. one problem again is that your LR stone is too far away to work well with 6.  B gets the good extension at 7 and 6 - to my mind - is floating. the more common approach at X gives the possiblity of sliding under, or invading later.   the where I would think of using this approach is if I had a large wall in the diamond-marked area, to make it hard for B to put 7 south of 6, but even then....]
;B[nd];W[ol]MA[jp][fp][fn]LB[pi:b]C[the 5th line feels way too high to me at this point. maybe if there was a W framework near the X's... but your only stone on the L is deep in the corner. given the B corner enclosure, which is also strong to the outside, 8 is too loose. it's easy for B to split you at 'b' and start a fight which I think would be in his favor.]
;B[qp]LB[dj:b][pi:c]C[I might have played 9 at 10, or b or c.]
;W[po];B[pq];W[qo];B[or];W[nq];B[ro]LB[nr:b]C[If I were B, I would have put 15 at 'b' so you couldn't block in sente.]
;W[rn];B[rp];W[nr];B[qr];W[cj]C[this seems like the right general direction to me, but I might have played 20 on the 4th line, to look toward your outside influence on the right. on the other hand looking ahead to 22---]
;B[ch];W[ed]TR[lc][kc]MA[dj][dn][fp][jp][ip]C[adum: is this a well timed move?

I think I would have played this instead of 20, to go ahead and break up B's side before he can make an answer. he has several ways to answer... I won't try to predict what would follow. once you got settled there you could start a fight at the triangled points, or (better perhaps) grab an important point in the lower left, marked by X's - it would depend on what kind of shape he had on the upper left, and who had sente.

I think having coming to this point, though, something like 22 is not out of place. It's either that or grab a big point for your own structure, to threaten to build a larger moyo than he can.  
With a 3-3 stone I think the 4-6 extensions are particularly valubable, expanding your area and preventing the easy 4-4 entry for B.]
;B[df];W[cc];B[bc];W[dc];B[bb];W[ef];B[de];W[he]C[since he can cut you off from 30, you might as well play it at 31]
;B[gd];W[ee];B[ge];W[gf];B[fc]MA[hf]C[I think he should have played 35 at X, looking to build an upper side moyo while keeping you under pressure.]
;W[dg];B[cg];W[hf];B[jd];W[di];B[dh];W[eh]C[here B could take in sente and then atari at X. he gives you a big advantage by letting you connect across.]
;B[dp]C[looking back to my first comments, think how much better able you would be to exploit your outside thickness above and to the right if your stone was at 43 -]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[fr];B[dl];W[fi];B[cp];W[bl];B[bk];W[bp];B[bo]
;W[bq];B[cn];W[bj];B[ck];W[gp]C[you were lucky to get 58. if I was black I would have jumped to the outside as soon as possible, to reduce the potential of your right side thickness.   this should have been his 49. getting penned in is very bad for him.]
;B[pj]MA[pi]C[if I was playing a pincer here, I think I would play it at X, to put the maximum pressure on the W stone and give myself more room to manuever. this seems like a bad time for this, though, with all the potential you have on the lower side.]
;W[nj];B[oi];W[gn]MA[ng]C[this is an excellent point, taking full advantage of his mistake, but I don't think I could abandon the stone on the upper right. if you come out to X you have a good attack on the 2 black stones, you can build thickness to reduce his upper side, and you may even be able to attack from underneath to build a moyo on the lower side.]
;B[jj];W[en];B[fo];W[go];B[fn];W[gl]C[I think you're strong enough here to play 68 at 69]
;B[fm];W[mh];B[ng];W[lf];B[me]C[adum: so i decide that my best chance for this game is to try and grab the whole center, or at least most of it and make black live small somewhere while shoring up the walls. Is this a good plan? Have I already made too many strategic mistakes by letting black get so much secure territory without adequate compensation?

the only place where I think he got too much from you was the upper right, where at the beginning you gave him a solid enclosure without making any thickness of your own.  his stone at the center point will help him, but you could still pull your stone out by playing 70 at 71 - his stones would have to make life in open space largely bordered by your thickness. I think sacrificing was a mistake.]
;W[kg];B[jm]MA[jo]C[adum: I'm not sure the best way to go about attacking this.

My first thought would be to play 76 at X - you secure territory, keep him away from side where its easier to make eyes, and maintain pressure. once he tries to put together a structure in the center you can start peeping to make him heavy.]
;W[kl];B[no];W[op];B[mk];W[nk];B[hm];W[gm];B[lm];W[km];B[kn]
;W[kj];B[jp];W[lp];B[ko];W[lo]LB[in:b][iq:c][ir:c]C[90 seems a little small - as shown by him ignoring it.  maybe something like b, to stop potential eyes and threaten a larger cut, and if he should connect then c?]
;B[hq]LB[in:b]C[or now?];W[ln];B[gq];W[fq];B[kq];W[io];B[ip]
;W[in];B[jl];W[jn];B[lq];W[mp];B[mr];W[os];B[pr]C[I may be wrong, I didn't spend a long time reading it out, but you might be able to start a ko by playing at b.

It seems to me the monkey jump is often ineffective in these situations because the defender can make eye shape attacking it.]

(;W[is];B[ir];W[hs];B[gs];W[gr];B[js]C[no need to capure here - it can't become an eye]
;W[fs];B[kr];W[ls];B[ms];W[ns]C[adum: i ran really short on time and had to move instantly, so it was basically a wasted move.]
;B[qg];W[qd];B[qe];W[pc];B[qc];W[qb];B[rd];W[rc];B[qd];W[ob]
;B[oc];W[sb]C[He let you off easy here- you shouldn't be able to live in such a tight spot outside of ko. it could get very complicated, especially since several of the important ko threats I saw for you (upper and lower left B groups, and lower right) could become ko's themselves. I didn't do the most important thing of all - I'm just too lazy I guess - I didn't count out the different alternatives, which is really what the decision should be based on.]

;B[rg];W[ak];B[bm];W[cl];B[dk];W[ag];B[bf];W[eb];B[pm]C[adum: i was afraid of the variation if I connected above.
   You had a lot of weakness in this area - you switched from here when you had sente to play on the lower left - one more stone could have saved you a big loss.]

(;W[on];B[pl];W[pk];B[qk];W[oj];B[pi];W[qj];B[ok];W[mq];B[lr]
;W[pk];B[ci]C[adum: perhaps this ko threat isn't big enough, because after s9 white has p13 sente.]
;W[dj];B[ok];W[dd];B[be];W[pk];B[kk];W[ll];B[ok];W[le];B[ld]
;W[pk];B[ml];W[mm];B[ok];W[hd];B[hc];W[pk];B[lk];W[lm];B[ok]
;W[nl]C[adum: i've realized that the ko is practically impossible to win -- black has internal ko threats anyway -- and i'm getting scared for my stones on the bottom. not that this move completely protects them.]

;B[gj];W[hi];B[fj];W[ej];B[fl];W[ek];B[fp];W[gi];B[jg];W[kh]
;B[jf]C[adum: even though white scraped through in the middle, i'm still down by ten points or more, so the game's basically been lost by this point. (I end up neglecting an atari on a big group and resigning anyway, which is typical, but that's another story.) In the end, it seems like losing the right side was the biggest problem, but I'm not sure exactly where I went wrong.

the right side and missing the atari together probably add up to black's victory. I don't think you were outplayed through the game; you both missed some oppurtunities. As I mentioned I thought your opening was somewhat awkward, but I don't think he capitalized on it. You built up a lot of center thickness but you didn't get nearly as much from it as you could have.  To me your biggest mistake was abandoning that stone on the right (of course this would have lead to a different game, where the other late game mistakes wouldn't apply...)

A go game is composed of so many variables, its usually meaningless to talk about where exactly someone went wrong...  though things like the right side and missing the atari are frustrating, mistakes will always happen, especially at the end when it comes down to details and your concentration starts to fade. i feel the thing to focus on is always the whole board, how to control the flow of play. if you can get ahead in the big picture you often avoid having to fight life and death struggles on unfavorable terms...  
hope this has been helpful.
