thanks for your review
faza

Hello, Faza. 
I'm Felisratus,  KGS 3 kyu, and I tryed my best to review your game. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask me. 
For further improving I strongly recomend you to read "Attack and Defence" by James Davies from Elementary Go Series and "Oppening Theory Made Easy" by Otake Hideo. 9 kyu is also a good time to learn some simple joseki.

Good luck!];B[pp];W[cc];B[dd];W[cd]LB[dc:A][de:B]C[FR: Black must play D15! (see explanation on the next move, why D17 is wrong)

See variations for 2 simple joseki]
(;B[dc]LB[de:B][cg:A]C[FR:  White must play  D15 instead of C13 ("hane at the head of two stones") and get superior position (all the variations below are better for W)
That's why D17 was wrong and the only josekie move for B is D15]
(;W[cg]LB[gd:A][ce:B][de:C]
(;B[gd];W[pc];B[pe];W[qd];B[qe];W[mc]LB[kc:A][qi:B]C[FR: 
A is an overplay. N17 is a strong stone, so it's better not to play near it (play away from thikness).  W can easylly invade J17 later. Locally K17 is better, than L17
But black must play B to make base for weak R15 group (it's urgent!)]
(;B[kc]C[FR: Now W can attack R15 stones with Q13 or Q14];W[pj]
C[FR: too gentle. q13 is more sever.]
(;B[qi]C[FR: R11 helps W to get srtonger (see variation). R12 or Q12 much better. (Don't touch the weak stones - you make them stronger)]
(;W[qq]C[FR: W is too gready. Normally it's a bad idea to play tenuki after a contact play such as r11.]
(;B[pq]C[FR: Isn't it better to block from the other side?]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn]
(;B[oo]C[FR: This move only protects the cut, but let W play R7 and get one line higher.
 R7 instead of P5 is the right way to protect the Q5 cut and enclose W inside (see variation)]
(;W[cq]C[FR: Empty corner is always big, but R7 is an urgent move for W]
;B[dp];W[dq];B[eq]C[FR: E3 is overplay. W can cut immediately and B will get 2 weak groups. See variations at move5 and some joseki book.]
;W[co]C[FR: W must cut or just play C4. No need to make a shape defect at C4.]
;B[fp]C[FR: Good! Now black's bottom is really huge.];W[jp]
;B[iq]C[FR: It's hard to find a good answer to k4. Maybe M3 would be better, but anyway it's a bit passive. The active way is to play k6 and start a big fight. Black is thick on the both sides, so the fight shoul be promising for him.
J3 "touches" the weak stone and makes it stronger.];W[jq]
(;B[lp]C[FR: 
M4 is inconsistent. After J3 B must play J4 - this is a key pont, preventing W from easy way to the outside.]
(;W[lq];B[mq];W[kq];B[lr];W[ir];B[hq];W[hr];B[gr];W[cp]C[FR: Now B can start attack on the W group (see variations)]
(;B[ck]LB[ci:A][cm:B]C[FR: C7 both attack C9 stone and prevents B from making the wall around D7]
(;W[ci];B[bm]C[FR: A good move. But W answer is a bit slack. See var.]
(;W[bn];B[cm]
(;W[id]TR[kc][gd]C[FR: J17 is the right point for invading this shape. J18 is a common mistake.]
;B[ic]C[FR: Right answer.];W[hc];B[hd];W[jc];B[ib]
(;W[jb];B[jd];W[kd];B[ie];W[kb];B[ke];W[lc]C[FR: This result is good for B: he builds very strong shape and get some profit.]
;B[ce];W[be]LB[bf:B][cf:A]C[FR: double hane is better.]
(;B[cf];W[bf];B[rl]C[FR: very good move! Now black's moyo on the east is really huge.]
;W[qm]C[FR: This is too risky for W. I think, it's better to play k6 first]
;B[rm];W[qr];B[pr];W[ql]C[FR: Seems like W is searching for troubles.]
;B[qk];W[pl];B[pk];W[ol];B[ok];W[qj]C[FR: O8 captures 4 W stones.]
(;B[rj];W[ml]
(;B[ln]C[FR: o7 is possible];W[nk];B[oj];W[nj];B[pi];W[pn]C[FR: W is too gready! He must simply play m10 or o12.]
;B[po];W[on];B[nm];W[nl];B[om];W[nn];B[mm];W[mn];B[lm];W[pm]
LB[mi:A][kj:C][lj:B]C[FR: A is the wrong direction, letting W run out towards the centre. B or C look more promising. But anyway the ongoing fight is very good for black! Definitely r7 was wrong.]

;W[ao];B[am];W[eo];B[fo];W[sn]C[fa: is this W group still killable?
i think T4 can give me a ko which leading me to kill this group

;B[oi]C[fa: i think this move is not needed right now
probably A19, K19, G11, E1, E14, or M1 better
but which is best?

K19 is 1 point sente, so it's best.

J19 is 2 point sente for W, so k19, preventing it, is the biggest gote move. 
B19 is big for the same reason.

E1, E14 and M1 are all 1 point gote.];W[gi];B[ls];W[db];B[eb]
