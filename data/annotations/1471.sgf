phi: Please point out the important points I missed in this game.]
;W[qn]C[kogeima kakari (basic joseki)];B[np];W[qf]
(;B[nc]LB[qj:A]TR[qn]C[Nin: Your game move is ok, but a move at 'A' would be more severe, which separates the white stones on the right side.  After playing the marked stone, white is supposed to play a stone at 'A' or one point to the left to complete the joseki.  Since white tenukis and plays the upper right corner first, a move at 'A' by black sets up the attack of the marked stone.  Besides, playing 'A', which is a 3-point pincer for the upper white stone, is also a joseki move for black.  Please see variation for one continuation sequence.]
;W[pj];B[pl]LB[dj:A][ql:B]C[Nin:  This is too early.  There are bigger points on the board.  For example, you can play 'A' for a san-ren-sei formation.  Even if you wan to invade right now, 'B' is the proper point.  Please see variation of how white can defend your game move.]

(;W[on];B[nl];W[mn];B[nj]LB[lp:A]C['A' is the proper move for black.  When white gets a chance to play at 'A', he can seal black in.]
;W[lp];B[rp];W[fq];B[hq]TR[mn][lp]C[Nin:  This is risky since white has gained thickness with his markes stones.  Please see variation of how white can punish black.]

(;W[fo]
(;B[ho]C[phi: Better to make a base on L3 here?

Nin:  The game move is better.  It puts some pressure on the two white stones.  If you want to  extend to the right side, K3 is better than L3.  Please see variation for an explanation of why this is the case.]
;W[dn]C[phi: black corner is surrounded.

Nin:  Unfortunately, due to the H3 overplay.]
(;B[fp]C[phi: Overplay? I want to connect the 4-4 Stone with the H3-H5 stones. Is this possible? Is it the right way?

Nin:  You can connect the two groups.  Please see variation.]
;W[ep];B[gp];W[dq];B[eo];W[eq]
(;B[fn]C[phi: I was giving up D4 (the initial 4-4 Point). I think protecting could work and also will leave white separated. (See variation).

Nin:  I couldn' find your variation in the game record.  But you are right, black can do better here.  Please see my variation.]

(;W[do];B[go];W[mr];B[nr];W[mq];B[nq];W[cf];B[fd];W[dj];B[gr]
LB[ds:A]C[Nin:  This is very small at this stage of the game.  When you play a move, ask yourself what the follow up move will be if your opponent  tenukis.  If the follow up move is not severe, then you know your move is not pressing.  After the game move, the follow up will be a monkey jump at 'A', which is about 8 to 10 points in sente during the endgame.  But 'A' won't be sente at this time.  There are many moves bigger than 10 points on the board at this stage.]
;W[ef]LB[ch:A][cl:B]C[Nin:  You ask a question at the end about the left side invasion.  Don't worry too much about it, as white only has territory on one side only.  There are a couple of invasion points here, but I  wouldn't do it at this time.  Develop the other parts of the board first.    In any case, please see the variations of what might happen if you invade at 'A' or 'B'.]

(;B[hd]LB[mo:A]C[Nin:  This is different than the lower right corner, in that omitting the game move would not allow white to seal black in.  'A' gets more profit.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[bf]
(;B[ae]C[Nin:  This move is gote and gives white a chance to make another move in the corner.  Please see variation for a better play.]
;W[eb];B[dc];W[db];B[fb]LB[mo:A]C[Nin:  This is overplay.  You can stop playing in this area.  Try 'A'.]
;W[ec];B[fc]LB[ed:A]C[phi: uh oh: I made a mistake here. But I think the error happened long before. How could I have played better?

Nin:  Block at 'A'.];W[ed];B[ee];W[fe];B[df];W[de];B[mo];W[dg]
;B[lo];W[ok]
(;B[nk]LB[ol:A]C[Nin:  Block at 'A'.  Your game move allows white to link up his two groups and you lose too much.  Please see variation.]
;W[ol];B[ln];W[jp];B[jo];W[jr];B[lr];W[of];B[kc]LB[rd:A]C[Nin: 'A' is bigger.  The corner is bigger than the side.]
;W[io];B[in];W[ko];B[jn];W[kn];B[km];W[kp];B[mm];W[ls];B[kr]
;W[ir];B[ks];W[hr];B[gq];W[ms]
(;B[fj]LB[dl:A]C[phi: could I have played A (D8) also to invade the left side in this situation?

Nin:  Yes, you can, but you need to read out the moves to be sure you can escape.  Please see variation.]
;W[kq];B[iq];W[jq];B[hs]
(;W[mp]LB[is:A]C[phi: We have agreed that white could have rescued the stones playing on A (J1) and making a seki.

Nin: Playing at 'A' doesn't save the group.  Please see the variation.]
;B[is];W[js]
(;B[gs]C[Nin:  This isn't necessary.  Please see variation.]
;W[dl];B[fl];W[no];B[nn];W[oo];B[om]LB[rd:A][cp:B][me:C][hf:D]
[fh:E][gg:F][pm:G][qc:H][rc:I][rb:J]C[phi: a small move. Any suggestions to play better? Like A to F?

Nin:  This move isn't small because black threatens to connect at 'G'.  When white ataris at 'G' and black connects, that is a small move.

Moves 'D', 'E', 'F' try to make some territory on the left side, but unfortunately your right side is open, around 'C'.  Likewise, a move around 'C' isn't good because white can push in around 'E'.   Keypoint:  If your opponent can push into your territory from more than one direction, you can't expect to make much profit since you can't seal both openings at the same time.    I don't see how 'B'  can work.  'A' is big and it is worth more than 20 points.  If white plays 'A' first, followed by the 'H', 'I', 'J' sequence, he makes lots of territory.]
;W[pm];B[nm]C[Nin:  This is small.];W[op]
(;B[oq]LB[pq:A]C[Nin:  'A' is better.  Please see variation.]
;W[pq];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[rq];W[qo];B[hf]C[Nin:  As you attempt to enclose from the left...]
;W[mf]C[Nin:  White jumps in from the right.];B[oh];W[qh];B[oj]
;W[pk];B[rd];W[ie];B[id]LB[he:A]C[Nin:  'A' is better.  White can't penetrate the upper side.  Linking up at 'A' is forcing, since black threatens to capture the peeping stone.]
;W[he];B[ge];W[gf];B[gd];W[je];B[gg];W[ff];B[if];W[le];B[mh]
;W[lc];B[lb];W[kd];B[jc];W[mc];B[mb];W[kh];B[jh]C[phi: I first wanted to disconnect the white stone on L12 playing on M13. But I was afraid, white could enter and distroy more.

Nin:  You can't separate his L12 stone.];W[ki];B[kg];W[lg];B[jg]
;W[lh];B[kj];W[ji];B[ii];W[lj];B[lk];W[kk];B[mj]C[phi: Was this an overplay? I wanted to be sure that whie on L9 dies. But Bruno (white) found a very smart tesuji...

Nin:  Your move is fine, but you make a mistake later.];W[gh]
;B[fh]C[phi: I should have played something to protect J11. Something like H11??

Nin:  You have too many cutting points.  Defend at H11 before you attack.]

(;B[qg]C[phi: instead of cutting, what would have been better? (I played some variations here)

Nin:  Again I couldn't see you variations.  Your pushing moves are fine, but you fail to take a vital point later on.  Please see my comments a few moves later.]

(;B[qb];W[ph];B[sm]LB[rr:A][so:B][sn:C]C[Nin:  You ask a question about this move.  For a monkey jump to work, usually there is a stone at 'A'.  In other words, black descends at S2 as opposed to bending at S3.  For this pattern, 'B' or 'C' is more common.]
;W[sn];B[rn];W[rm];B[so];W[ro]
(;B[sn]LB[rl:A]C[phi: this was wrong. Is there a standard in this situation?

Nin:  Fight the ko at 'A'.  This ko is too heavy for white.  He will back off.  Please see variation.]

(;B[dl];W[em]C[Nin:  This is the most severe attack from white when you invade.  You need to be sure you can escape before the invasion.  Try to read out as much as you can and then make a decision.  That's the fastest way to improve.  If you invade first and hope you can escape, you are not practicing your reading ability and you are slowing down your progress.]
