;W[ej];B[dk]LB[kc:A]C[I think this result favirable for me (black)
Do you agree ?

** I don't think there's much in it. Black gets some profit,
but white gets good thickness. As long as white can play
around (a) he should not be dissatisfied.];W[md]LB[kc:A]C[** Leaves an easy invasion at (a).]
;B[pf]LB[kc:A]C[** Could also play at (a), the ensuing fight should be
ok for black.];W[pc];B[oc]C[** Good since the top is clearly more valuable than the
corner.];W[od];B[pb]LB[ob:A]C[Ok, It's a mistake. I read the ishida but  after the game !

** Yes, (a) is the move.];W[qc];B[qd];W[ob];B[nc];W[qb]LB[nd:A]
C[i'm not so sure it's a good idea for white  to take the corner.

** Yes, probably (a) would work better with the left, although the
end result would not be great for white.];B[nd];W[oe];B[nb]
;W[pa];B[ne]LB[lc:A]C[** Alternatively at (a) to avoid hurting the group on the
right, but that might be a little bit submissive.];W[of];B[qg]
LB[pg:A][rd:B]C[** Just (a) looks better. Note that (b) will be sente against
the corner.];W[nf];B[me]C[I think this fight is equal. And black is  happy to develoop in this direction.

** Depending on how much pressure white can bring to bear
on the black groups, the fight could even be good for him. His
thickness on the left is working now.];W[qi]C[strange. But white will reenforce his  group in sente.

** A pincer looks ok here, keeps black on the run.];B[pi];W[ph]
C[** But this is wrong, capturing a stone gets black
settled too easily.];B[qh];W[oh];B[qj];W[ri];B[rj];W[oi];B[pj]
;W[kd]C[** Again this is natural.];B[lf]C[** Good.];W[mc]LB[je:A]
[lh:B]C[strange.

** Yes, (a) or (b) would be more natural.];B[lh];W[mg];B[lg]
;W[nk];B[id]LB[jc:A][fc:B][na:C][ma:D][lk:E]C[Too greedy, I think but I wabted to  exploit the thinness of white wall on the  left.

** It doesn't look so unreasonable, given that (a) + (b) should be
enough for life, and the group on the right is quite weak. Also (c)
or (d) are sente against the corner. But it might have been safer to
jump to (e) first.];W[je];B[hf]CR[nb][oc][nc][nd][ne][me][lf]
[lg][lh]LB[jc:A][kc:B][fc:C]C[** Jumping this way is dangerous -- it hurts the
marked stones for one thing.];W[jg];B[hh];W[ji];B[lj]C[** Now black loses sente on the left. Running fights with
multiple groups (here 4) are quite interesting, but difficult
to play right!];W[mi];B[li];W[jk];B[ll];W[ig];B[gd]LB[ee:A]
[fc:B]C[** Good point. White now has a very weak point at (a). He should
play (b) here.];W[hc]LB[fc:A]C[** (a) is better.];B[gc];W[ic]
;B[hd];W[jd];B[fh];W[di];B[ci];W[ff];B[fg]LB[gf:a]C[i'm not sure between this and a.

** (a) gives both sides  better shape, so its difficult
to say.];W[gf];B[hg];W[ie];B[he];W[eg]LB[ee:A]C[** Still leaves (a).]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[hj];W[gi];B[hi];W[fk];B[hk];W[fl];B[hm]LB[ee:A]
C[** Here black could just play (a).];W[jm];B[ln]LB[jj:A]C[** There is also a move at (a) to harass the middle white
group. On the other hand, also the white group on the
right is very weak ...];W[in];B[gm];W[fm];B[go];W[nm];B[fn]
;W[en];B[em]LB[fp:A]C[I was very proud of that move. but now i  think it was a mistake.

** Its certainly an aggressive  move, and probably an overplay
given that black has quite a good game at this stage. But it's
not that unreasonably, really, and one should take into account
that playing something safe like (a) gives white rather an easy
time of it.];W[el];B[dm];W[dl];B[cm]LB[dn:A]C[** But here (a) looks better.]
;W[cl];B[bm]LB[bn:A]C[** Again something like (a) looks better.]
;W[fo];B[gn];W[fp];B[fq]LB[gp:A][cp:B]C[?
** This is bad. I would play (a) expecting F3, followed by
(b).];W[kk];B[lk];W[gp]TR[go][fq]C[** Letting white come out between the black marked stones
like this is always bad.];B[ho];W[jp];B[ep]LB[cp:A]C[** Bad since it loses (a).]
;W[dp]C[** Now the fight is almost impossible for black.];B[hp]
C[** Hurts the corner but necessary];W[gq];B[hq];W[gr];B[cq]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[cp];B[hr];W[fr];B[eq];W[eo];B[bl]LB[bk:A]C[** Black can't save both these stones and the corner.
The four stones here are important, since they cut the
still-unsettled left corner off, but it looks better to play
(a) here (keeps white from capturing the two stones
above in sente).];W[ck];B[ap];W[ao];B[aq]LB[ar:A]C[** As a desperation measure, (a) would be better.]
;W[bn];B[bk];W[cj];B[bj];W[er];B[dr];W[ds];B[cs];W[br];B[es]
;W[fs]LB[jo:A][io:B][jn:C][ol:D]C[** Black has lost a group, but before giving up he should
look for weaknesses in the white positions. He could play
(a)-(b)-(c), for example, or see what happens after (d).];B[cn]
