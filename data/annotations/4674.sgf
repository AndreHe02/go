C[This game was my first ever half-point loss.  Even worse, it was self-inflicted by a mistake in filling dame at the end since otherwise it would have been a half-point victory!  Nonetheless, it was a very close game and one in which I felt like I hadn't made any obvious blunders.  I have White with 0.5 komi, due to the rank difference.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[dc];W[pp];B[eq];W[cj]C[Blocking the corner enclosure seemed like a good start.  I figured C7 and C13 would be miai, based on which direction black approached me from, even after the corner enclosure was made in the top right (which I assumed would be black's next move).

If its a good idea or not, i can't say for sure. But what is good for sure is, you've got a plan. :-) Another good idea would be to play at D15. Black would pincer and in the following sequence black would probably make influence facing down the left while white will take the top, or both waste the influence of the other. Both results would be equal.]
;B[ce];W[jd]C[Blocking the corner enclosure again, and extending from Q16.

Thats the drawback of your play: Allowing Black to make 2 corner enclosures gives black a lot of good opportunities, which you are eager to hinder now.]

(;B[pj]C[This looks a bit passive too me.];W[jp]C[Last big point.]
;B[pf];W[nd];B[qd];W[qc];B[qe];W[rc];B[pn];W[qo]C[R5 seemed warranted, with the stone at K4.]
;B[hc];W[ic];B[hd];W[gq]C[This seems clearly the wrong place of the board. It doesnt protect a weak group of yours, it doesnt make any territory, and what is even worse, it doesnt has any effect of the black position. If you where black, only locally, where would you expand from the corner enclosure in the lowser left? To the left side, where a move would weake an enemy stone or along the lower side, where my new stone could end to overconcentrated to my secure corner? The answer would tell you where to play at white.]
;B[nq];W[oq]C[Blocking access to the corner seemed the most important thing to do in response to the invasion at O3.  I figured the two stones at G3 and K4 could take care of themselves most likely, even if black did manage to wedge between.

Yes, they could take care about themselve, but take in mind that you already have a potentially weak stone on the left. While treatening the lower stones, black makes the left stone weaker every move. You will survive with both, but while attacking you, black will expand his territory.]
;B[or];W[pr];B[op];W[pq];B[qn]C[very inconsequent by black.]
;W[np]C[Seemed like black had suddenly given up on the invasion, so turned my attention to capturing as much as I could.]
;B[ch];W[cm]C[Miai with C13.];B[mr]
(;W[oo]C[Making the ponnuki felt appropriate, both for fighting and access to the center.]
;B[nm];W[lo]C[seemes an overplay to me, better at N4. The point is, that this move not really effects black on the bottom, nor effects blacks growing moyo on the right, it doesnt really connect the white stones (for the time comming). It does all this a little, but nothing for sure. :-(]
;B[kr];W[jr]C[At this point, I believed the invading group was dead.  Either N3 or P1 would prevent an eye there.]

(;B[nf];W[le];B[eh]
(;W[gf]C[At this point, I was starting to become concerned by the size of black's two main territories in the upper left corner and the right side.  I figured that working to reduce the upper left corner would help settle my group at C10 and C7 also.

No, it doesnt. In fact it hurts your stones there. Imagin, that black would build a wall now arround G12. Would this help your stones on the left? At the same time, it attacks you stone at G14, so you can think that it secures points in the upper left or weakens your stones to the left, but never decrease the points in the corner while strengthing the white stones.

You have to look for a better point. It would be helpful to count the score at this stage of the game.

Black has about 30 points in the top left, 24 points on the right and 8 points in the lower left. Whit has 40 points on the bottom (if you count the invader as dead), 25 secure points at the top and  a group on the left.
Seeing this, white would have a small advanture in points, and if you can stabilize your left group without helping black to get more points, you will probably win, if black doesnt find a way to live with his N2-group.]
;B[hg];W[hf];B[if];W[ie];B[fe];W[jf]C[I was expecting black to cut at H15 and fight, but was perfectly happy making a solid connection here instead.]
;B[rd]C[much to slow. the focus of the game is the lower left area. there is a weak group of white and, if this becomes secure, suddenly the black corner becomes weak.]
;W[ni]C[I was conflicted on whether to reduce here or make a ponnuki with J13.  It seemed important that I work on reducing black's right side territory immediately.

Here your decision is right perhaps. getting the ponnuki would be beautiful in itself, but your stones there are secure without it, so its not really necessary.]
;B[ph];W[ok];B[ml];W[pl];B[on];W[nj];B[no];W[mp]C[Now the black stones are dead for sure. :-)]
;B[hb]C[Bad overplay. its an endgame-move, a big one, but only endgame.]

(;W[ib];B[ia];W[ja];B[ha];W[jb];B[rn]
(;W[ro];B[qk];W[ql];B[rl];W[pk];B[qj];W[mg]C[I had played enough stones inside black's former territory on the right side that I was a bit more worried about them being cut off now, since they obviously had no eye shape at all.]
;B[ig];W[he];B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[bo];B[bp];W[fp];B[co];W[bn]
;B[li];W[mh];B[jl];W[gi]C[K8 felt like a big point, in that it was almost exactly where I wanted to play.  I figured that G11 would both extend from my group on the left side and threaten black in the center.

The center is almost connected with the right, so there is nothing to threaten, or i am overlooking something?]
;B[gg];W[ff];B[ef];W[ej];B[fg];W[jn]C[Trying to expand the territory on the bottom side and threaten black's center area again.]

(;B[ij]C[There is nothing to gain for black here, but he could destroy some territory instead.]
;W[hm];B[gk];W[fl];B[fj];W[fk]C[I realized here that G11 was cut off , but thought I could put it to use as a sacrifice to help strengthen my own walls.]
;B[gj];W[ei];B[fi];W[mn];B[sc];W[sb];B[sd];W[ra];B[bi]C[biggest endgame.]
;W[bj];B[dn];W[dm];B[en];W[ep];B[dp];W[gn]C[I had debated between playing here and O6. 
Both are gote, what about A4 first?];B[fq];W[hp];B[so];W[rp]
C[I thought black might be able to make some mischief here, with the atari at Q5 and such, so took the safe route and extended once before the hane.]
;B[sp];W[sq];B[sn];W[rq];B[mf];W[kh]C[I had to think about this one for awhile, as I wasn't sure I could guarantee a connection to the group at the top.  L12 seemed like the most likely possibility, as it would also be threatening to encroach on black's center territory.]
;B[ao];W[an];B[ap];W[jg]C[In retrospect, I think I should have just played this at L13 to make the bamboo joint and stop worrying about staying connected.

M14 would be good too.];B[di];W[dj];B[ci];W[lm];B[ji];W[ki]
;B[me];W[md];B[lf];W[ke];B[lj];W[kg]C[K13 seems like very much a wasted move now.

Yes, it is.];B[kj];W[ll];B[hl];W[im];B[nn];W[il];B[ik];W[gl]
;B[hk];W[kk];B[jk];W[ai]C[I think I should have played the hane at G1 instead of this one, since that one was in a more "complicated" area.

I cant argue against both points.];B[ah];W[aj];B[oe];W[od];B[cn]
;W[bm];B[hs]
(;W[ir]C[Again, I wasn't certain that black couldn't make some mischief if I hane'd immediately at J1.  With the black stones within my territory, I thought I couldn't afford to make a mistake with that and played it safe.

You are right on this. :-)];B[oj];W[nk];B[is];W[js];B[gs];W[og]
C[This stone was the bright idea that if I peeped the Q13 space and black responded there, I could cut off at least four black stones. 
And if not? At least, you dont lose sente whith it. :-)]
(;B[pg];W[of]C[Black obliged me on the peep, so taking my reward now.]

C[Aiee!!!  I just filled in my own point of territory.  I honestly thought I was filling a dame point until I saw the captures disappear, and then I realized what I'd done.  Lesson learned that I need to pay more attention filling dame.  Especially due to the fact that I lost by half a point specifically because of this move. Doh!]

You got back in the game and got some chances on the right to make it really complicated for black. In the end you tricked black for 4 stones and at least yourself for 1 point.
Congratulation for an exciting game and i am sure you will get better each game you think of as hard as over this one. :-)

good luck. :-)
