C[hi,
thanks a lot for reviewing my game.
I play Black.

----
Hi! My name is Jori (Readl on KGS) and I'll be reviewing your game today.]
;B[pd];W[dp]C[rpablo007: gg];B[pq]C[haoben_haoben: mm];W[qf]
LB[dd:A][qh:B]C[Jori: Please see next more for information on the B variation.]

(;B[dd]TR[nc][qc]SQ[ph][qh][pi][qj]C[me: It's ok to Tenuki, right?

Jori: Tenuki here is okay as long as you are comfortable with the fact that it gives white many options in the upper right. He could take the corner with 3-3 or try to complicate black's development on the upper side with a variety of moves. The triangles represent two common moves white could try to develop that corner of the board right away.

The most common alternative to tenuki here might be a pincer at any of the points marked with squares.  The move at R10 isn't too common, but you can see how it works well with the stone at Q3. 
I added a variation for the one space low pincher  to show a joseki that you have probably already seen in other people's games because it is so common. It's easy to learn because the logic behind the moves is easily understandable.]
;W[fc]LB[hc:B][hd:C][id:A]C[Jori: Please read what I wrote after the next move before looking at the variations.]

(;B[id]LB[cc:B][dc:A][fe:C]C[me: I tried to somehow reinforce the upper right stone in case White gets sente and make a double approach? Was that ok? Could I did better?

Jori: Pincering White here is a great idea. I have added a few variations so you can see a few joseki ways of developing the situation.  You can see which variation is 1) easy for you to understand 2) works with the existing black stones 3) matches your play style (whether you prefer cash in the bank or influence).

And remember: the most important part of these variations is that you have to feel comfortable with the result they give you! If  you feel like your shape is too flimsy or you don't understand how the follow-ups should work, it's probably better to either avoid using that variation for now or testing it out in a game to see what kind of continuations it will give you. Just because something it joseki does not mean it has to be played :)]

(;W[dc]LB[ed:A]SQ[cc]C[me: Have no idea how to respond I was concerned about the crosscut. Decided avoid the tiger's mouth.

Jori: This move by white is actually not very good. It doesn't allow white to take the corner nor is the extension wide enough for white's group to be alive. I'm sure we can figure out some way of harassing him here. 

My initial instinct would be to block at C17. This gives black points in the upper left, while at the same time it can lead to variations that might allow him to spread further down the left side. There are no common joseki for the continuation (although I was able to find one on Eidogo that leads to a messy fight in the upper left), but it is very hard to do badly after you play C17.

I added a variation with C17 just to show one of the many possible ways to continue.]

(;B[ed];W[ec];B[cd]C[was better block at F16?

Jori: If you want to make a large black wall facing down the left side, F16 was better. However, I think C17 would probably still be preferable.]
;W[cc];B[ge];W[dj];B[dh];W[dl];B[qh]C[Jori: Great pincer!];W[qc]
;B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[oc];B[nd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[nc]
;B[md];W[lb]C[Jori: Kind of a waste of move for white. Because his group was already big enough to live and this move does not give him many additional points, he should have been more worried about the bottom right corner.]
;B[qn]C[try to make a moyo

Jori: Right idea at the right time. One higher might be a bit better.]
;W[ql];B[pm];W[qj];B[oh]C[was to soft?

Jori: It makes the two white stones feel uneasy and solidifies your upper right black stones, what's not to like?

Although it's possible to lean in on the white group a bit more, you are keeping up the pressure on the white stones, which is the right idea here.]
;W[ok];B[nl];W[nk];B[ml];W[ol];B[om];W[ni];B[fq]C[would be better at k3? didn't how to handle the coming invasion

Jori: This is the right idea, but just like you thought, the follow-up gets messy. there is no way white would give you all that territory, so he has to invade. with F3 you are giving yourself the option of attacking the invading white stones and sliding into the bottom left corner.

K3 is too passive. It's not forcing white to fight for the game. If you want to just try to cash in on your moyo, I think you can extend J3 or H3 to give yourself more points :)]
;W[jq]LB[dn:A][kp:C][lq:B]C[Jori: I added one variation I explain under next move.]

(;B[dn]C[me: I tried to become stonger and get sente to attack the white stone. If did'nt respond at the coner I will invade or cover

Jori: This move tries to stir things up too much. The white responce exploits the weakness you created.
I'm not sure if it's the right move here, but my initial instinct was to play at K4 or L4 to keep the white group flat against the bottom side. I added one possible continuation for that.]
;W[eo];B[go];W[en];B[lq];W[hq];B[ip];W[hp]LB[ho:A][io:B]C[me: the variation was better?

Jori: I think playing at A is correct. Black should fight to avoid being split.]

(;B[ho];W[iq];B[fp]C[me: I think this was too heavy. what would be better?

Jori: I would simply play K4 or L4 to make the moyo come alive. If white cuts at F4, black gives up the one stone and jumps to C3 for corner territory.]
;W[jp]C[Jori: White notices how much black moyo he can destroy and digs right in. More efficient at K5, but if white is worried about living, K4 is okay.]
;B[hm];W[io];B[hk]C[Jori: Kind of a wasted move by black. The black stones are already far enough to live and playing this move doesn't really give black any additional territory.]
;W[in]C[Jori: This is slow. He should have either jumped deeper into black moyo or extend to D3 for a huge amount of points. Black C3 or D2 would have been a nice way to punish him for being a silly goose.]
;B[gm];W[mn]C[Jori: White cashes in on being able to break into your moyo.]
;B[nn];W[mo];B[no];W[mq];B[mp];W[lp];B[np];W[lr];B[nq];W[mr]
C[Jori: White should have taken M3. I hope later Black will play M5 for a few extra points.]
;B[oi]C[Jori: I think Q10 is a more normal way of disturbing white, but this is a great time to go after him and your move works well i this game!]
;W[nj];B[rk];W[rm];B[qk];W[pk];B[pl];W[rj];B[rl];W[pi];B[ph]
;W[rh];B[qi]C[Jori: Good!];W[pj];B[ri]C[me: should be at s13?

Jori: S13 let's white get in 11, which means that he would almost get one eye.  Playing here is a strong way to play that should make white scared for his group's life.]
;W[si];B[mg]SQ[li][lj]C[Jori: I think M11 or M10 would be a stronger way for black to hem the white group towards the black area. The focus here should be on 1) preventing white from connecting or getting enough breathing space for making eyes 2) keeping all black stones alive while in pursuit.]
;W[li];B[kk];W[ji];B[jg]SQ[hi]C[Jori: definitely should block white at H11 to keep him running. You've made such a good job of connecting all your black groups at this point that you should feel confident about pursuing him to the fullest.]
;W[kg]TR[ji][li]C[Jori: The triangle shape is a common way of trying to make eyes. This is the turning point where one slack move by Black allows white to turn his eyeless group into a living group. 

Threatening a cut (N12) is a solid way of reducing his eyespace while keeping sente.L13 could also be used in this situation to remove eye potential and threaten a cut at L12.]
;B[kf];W[lg];B[lf];W[mh];B[ng]C[me: I thought I could be cut. I coldn't right? What to do insted?

Jori: at this point is probably already too late to kill white so protecting your territory is the right priority.]
;W[jh];B[lo]C[Jori: This is good, but does not end in sente. Because all groups are alive and there isn't much empty space left on the board (except C3), the priority should be on endgame moves that maximize the total amount of points while keeping sente.

At this point though, C3 would have still won you the game. The corner invasion is always a huge point to take.]
;W[kp];B[ln];W[kj];B[jl];W[ig];B[cq]C[Jori: Good!];W[dq];B[dr]
;W[er];B[br]C[Jori: C2 is the correct move. If w E3, b B5 or C4 lives.]
;W[eq]C[Jori: white should D1 first.];B[cp];W[co];B[bo];W[cn]
;B[bn];W[cm];B[ci];W[cj];B[fr]C[me: to Eite don't make too much territory on the bottom

Jori: This actually looks like a move that forces white to threaten your black corner, so it is very dangerous.]
;W[ds];B[cr];W[bm];B[bc]C[me: should had invade the side instead? It became very big later...

Jori: Because of w D1, the bottom left corner is actually not completely alive yet. I added a few variations on how white could continue and kill black.

But you are right, if b2 had been at C2, invading from the side is better for black at this move.]

(;W[bb];B[bd];W[ib];B[ab];W[cb];B[mc];W[mb]LB[hc:A][gh:B]
(;B[hc];W[hb];B[gc];W[gb];B[fd];W[fg]C[me: very sad right

Jori: eh, it's not too bad.  Black has to patch it up, but it's important to notice that white isn't making any points here. As long as you keep the territory you lose to a minimum, this move won't affect the score too much.]
;B[gg]C[Jori: this move is strange, I'm not sure what the intent was. Just playing at E13 would have been sufficient.]
;W[fh];B[ei];W[gh];B[hg];W[hh];B[if];W[jf]C[Jori: losing this stone and the ones after it cost you a lot more points than just doing E13 :)]
;B[je];W[hf];B[gf];W[ie];B[df];W[jd];B[ke];W[ic]C[Jori: black should have played at H16. White can't follow up with H15 because he would put himself into an atari.]
;B[he];W[if];B[hd];W[kc];B[nr]SQ[is]C[Jori: This move is a bit small. Even if white had played O2, black P2 stops him. Sliding to J1 or stopping at S13 are both larger than this.]
;W[rg]C[me: I had forgotten about this side. when it was a good timefor Black to had played here?]
;B[pf];W[ns];B[os];W[ms];B[or];W[sk]C[Jori: at this point the white's sente combo can't be helped.]
;B[qm];W[sl];B[ql]
(;W[sm]C[me: White should had play s6, right?

Jori: I added the S6 variation. It comes out to about the same.]
;B[ro]C[Jori: Should be at T5 or S6 to completely stop white.]
;W[so];B[sp];W[sn];B[rp];W[an]C[Jori: White fails at killing black.]
;B[ap];W[bi];B[bh];W[di];B[ch];W[bj];B[ai];W[aj];B[ah];W[eh]
LB[eg:A][fj:B]
(;B[eg];W[ef];B[dg];W[ff];B[ee];W[fe];B[gd];W[fj]TR[ei]SQ[gd]
[fe]C[me: I think should be better played here instead of e13

Jori: With your variation white can still play E14 and keep gnawing at black's territory. Losing the stone at E11 does cost black at least two points (black stone + 1 territory for white), but in exchange he would also save two points worth of his territory marked with squares.

The good thing here is that white has lost sente. Now it is black's turn to think of all the little annoying things he can do to white in sente to reduce.]

;B[hs];W[js];B[gs];W[es];B[cs];W[km]LB[kl:B][jm:A]C[me:tottaly missed L8?

thanks a lot for reviewing my game.
hope to play with you someday

Jori: you're right, B2 would have let black keep the two white stones.]

Jori: doing this would give black about three points more territory, but if white plays H17 after that, he would also get 2 points of territory, so it isn't big either way.

If you look at the number of points and territory made by both sides, doesn't it look like they're right about even? 

What would happen if white had played L4 at K4 instead back at move 58?]
))
(;B[lq];W[jo];B[ip];W[jp];B[gn]C[is this better?

Jori: This looks interesting. It has some real fighting spirit, although I am worried about the black's thinness. 

I'm not good enough in Go to be able to say whether this is a bad move, but if I was white, I would definitely be able to escape or live with the white K4 group. After that (depending on how the game was going), I might get a little worried about how the three black stones will live.

I think it's a sequence that is worth exploring. It definitely has the right idea of making white pay for jumping into your influence.]

Here black can either extend down the left side to around C9-C10 or solidify the upper side by harassing the white group with H18 or pincering the R14 stone. 

There are many options, most of which are pleasant for black.]

(;W[fe];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[ib];B[cj]C[Jori: This variation makes Black feel a bit nervous about the top side, doesn't it?

However, white is not completely secure at the top yet and the joseki calls for a reinforcing stone at J17. Because this variation does not show up often in lower kyuu games, I have added a joseki continuation for black to take advantage of white's weakness if they tenuki.]

;B[jb];W[jc];B[ic];W[kb];B[hb];W[ja];B[gc]SQ[pd]C[This is the end of the Joseki, but as you can see,  while it does leave white with two weaker groups and wipes out a lot of the lovely opportunities of the Q16 stone.]

In kyuu games you often see the other playing playing tenuki instead of C13. If so, black can block in the white group at the top left and leave himself in a good position to pester the C4 stone in the lower right.]
)
(;B[hd]C[Jori: my joseki book this one is considered "modern." I see it pretty often in KGS games.

White can either jump to C17 to take the corner (which is bad here because it would help black get more influence on the topside), or to jump out like the joseki continuation. 

If white tenuki, black should go after the lone white stone and either develop a giant wall or get a lot of points while doing so. There are many ways you can do that :)]
;W[fe];B[df];W[db];B[cc];W[hb];B[cj]C[Black ends up with a huge area in the top right and the top left becomes weaker. If you prefer the "cash in the bank" approach in your games, this would be a great result for you.]

In the actual game, white might choose to omit N17 and jump to the D16 corner instead. If he does, black should seal in the white group to the top right.]
