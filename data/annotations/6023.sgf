C[Reviewer:

Many thanks in advance!

I was White in this game, Komi = 0.5, and the opponent is my son, so although I'm the only one asking questions, your comments on Black's moves are also appreciated. (I won by 11.5)

This game is typical of our recent battles, and fairly accurately represents our current abilities (or lack thereof).

Many questions in the early going, few later.];B[dc];W[pc];B[cp]
;W[pq];B[qo];W[np]C[W6. I played this in anticipation of the later development in the LL corner. It seems to me to be intrinsically acceptable, but is there a better move? If so, what and why.]

(;B[qq];W[qr]
(;B[rq];W[pp]C[W10. This is Black's shape point, so I saw no reasonable alternative. Was I correct. If not, what would have been better?

A: This is a fine move. I can't see any alternatives.];B[po]
C[* R8 is better. It is more solid than Q5];W[eq]C[W12. My expectation when playing W4.  Is it good? If not, what would have been better, and why?

* This is the natural following of O4. I bet 99% of players play this move.]

(;B[dq]C[B13. This isn't in any of the Joseki books, but I haven't been able to find a refutation. Black winds up with a small corner plus Sente, so it seems good for him. But if that's really true, why isn't it Joseki? And if it's not true, what's the refutation? I haven't a clue!

A: I don't think D3 is a good move. I prefer D5 or princer.]
;W[ep]C[W14. Black's shape point, so I saw no reasonable alternative. Is there one? If so, what? Allowing B14 seems like giving up too much.]
;B[cn];W[iq];B[kq]C[B17. As expected! This is the key move that structures all of the remainder of this game, so your rather complete comments here and for the next few moves would be greatly appreciated!

Should Black invade now? If not, where else should he play? If an invasion is correct, is this the best point? And if not, what would be better?

A; It is too early for B to invade now. R 15 is clearly a good move. Also, because W is very strong around L3, the invasion looks too aggresive.]

(;W[lq]C[W18. I know that attaching to a weak stone is generally counterproductive, but my idea is to preclude Black's getting even one eye at the edge. I also know that, generically, capping at L5 is usually considered better, but I condiered that premature here. So was my decision reasonable? If not , what should I have played instead?

A: This is a bad move. W shouldn't be afraid of a fight.];B[lr]
;W[mq];B[kp];W[jr]C[W22. Consistent with my idea of denying Black an eye on the edge.]
;B[kr];W[io]C[W24. At this point I was happy with my game, with the expectation of profiting elsewhere while later harrassing the growing Black weak group.

* The M3 - J5 sequence makes B's L3 group strong. note that the W group in the LR corner has no eyes either.]
;B[kn];W[lo];B[ko];W[on];B[qm];W[qe]C[W30. No rush to attack the weak group! But is this the best use of my Sente? If not, what would be better?

* While attacking, W should beware its own weak groups.]
(;B[lc]C[B31. This is typical of Black's play, trying to deny me much of anything. My gut tells me that this is an overplay, but I'm unable to prove it, so please tell me if it's reasonable/best! If this isn't best for Black, what would have been better?

* This looks a fine move to me although L17 would be safer.]
;W[jc]C[W32. This stone is stronger than B31 in my opinion, so I like this move. Am I right? If not, what would have been better?

* W has to invade if B has expanded at M17.];B[hc]
(;W[nc]C[W34. I believe that W32 is still ok, so I take a bit of profit. Good strategy? Or bad? if bad, what would have been better?]

(;B[md]C[* It is not wise to develop toward W's strong stones.]
;W[ce]C[W36. W32 still seems OK, and this is big! Right? Or?

* It is too good for W to get C15.];B[cd]C[B37. Same scenario as in LL corner, and I still don't like it for B.]
;W[de]
(;B[jd]C[B39. Expecting this to be Sente, but ...];W[ci]C[W40. Black has spent 4 moves locally and W32 is still not captured! So I think that this has favored me. Right? Or?

A: It is right. B'v moves are not efficient enough.];B[ck]C[B41. He could kill W32 now, but that would allow me to play C8. Did  Black make the right decision?

* C9 is a big move and has the following at C13.];W[id]C[W42. Time to save W32. Right?]
;B[ic];W[kd];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[je]C[W48. Given the large unsettled Black group below, IMHO this sets up an ideal situation for me. Is my judgment correct? If not, why not.

A: W should be aware of the fact that B has more territory at the moment.]
;B[gd]C[* It is better to defend at F16];W[mb];B[lb];W[ge];B[fe]
;W[hd];B[fd];W[be];B[bc];W[gf];B[ff];W[eg]
(;B[qi]C[B61. I consider this to be a greedy overplay. Am I right? If so, what would have been better for B here?

* Not greedy at all because the surrounding B groups are already very strong.]
;W[qj]MA[rj][sj][rk][sk][rl][sl]C[W62. To seal off any potential connection for the weak Black lower center group to his strong right side stones.

* Again, W rushes to invade. Such a invasion can only remove 6 B (crossed) points while putting the W stone in danger. There are plenty of moves that are bigger than 6 points!]
;B[rj]C[* B played way too negative. Should have counter-attacked at Q10. Later, B can attack the whole W group at LR corner by taking its eye at P2.]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[ql];B[rl];W[pm];B[qn];W[pi];B[qh];W[kl]C[W72. Now I have the perfect attacking scenario! IMHO from this point on, the game "plays itself". My aim isn't to kill the weak group, but to profit handsomely elsewhere while attacking it.

No further questions from this point on - please just point out any errors.

* As a consequence of W's defensive play on the right, B seems to losing control of the game.]
