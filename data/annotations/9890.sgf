C[Daniel: Hello, my name is Daniel.  Thanks for submitting your review for me to do.  I'll be prefacing all of my comments with "Daniel:" like with this one to differentiate from the notes you've left in.  I'll add variations so make sure to check those out, and I'll put in some general comments of what to focus on in order to improve at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc]
(;B[lc]LB[qk:A]C[I felt this was good to pincer here due to stone at A

Daniel: What about the stone at A makes you think that?  Does the pull-back look over-concentrated.  It's currently a six space extension, so it's a bit wide now, and adding a stone would help that.  In terms of being helpful for fighting, a fourth line stone would be much more helpful.  What A is doing right now is developing the right side, looking to turn it into territory.  The pincer is in some ways an invitation to fight, but you don't want to fight in your territory, you want to fight in your influence.  I don't think this is a huge mistake, I just think the high pull-back is a little better.]
;W[ne];B[pf]C[Daniel: Good.];W[pb]C[wasn't sure how to respond to this move]
;B[qc]LB[lc:A]C[this kinda works but does kinda sacrifice my stone at A

Daniel: I think this is fine.  W needs to spend a move to prevent A from settling and even then it's not truly dead.  This move takes the corner, gets sente and leaves aji.  That's enough.]
;W[ic]
(;B[le]C[Daniel: I see the appeal of this move, but I'm inclined to say it's too small with so much of the board open right now.  Looking through the continuations, I'm not wild about this fight for B, and I'm inclined to say it would be better to just give up that area for now to take sente in the lower left.  It's a hard call though, and a stronger player definitely might have a differing opinion.]
;W[ng]C[Daniel:  This is a tough situation with the running battle.  You put in a possible continuation or two and I've added some variations and comments.  As a general comment, I think there a few important things to keep in mind in situations like this.  1) Both players have weak groups.  The relative strength of those groups is the most important thing right now.  2) Stay connected and look for opportunities to cut.  One weak group vs one weak group is even, but if you cut you may be able to turn it into one weak group vs two weak groups, and settle by killing part of W's group 3) Go is a game of territory and influence.  You want to gain one or both of those things if possible.]

(;B[ni]TR[lc][le]C[Daniel: This move seems bad to me because 1) It doesn't help the triangled stones 2) It leaves the right open.]
;W[lg];B[fq]C[Daniel: If you were going to tenuki to down here, you shouldn't have played M15.  Now you're risking W getting 7th line territory on the top.  If the two B stones at the top die, it's huge for W, and B would need massive compensation to make up for it.]

(;W[dn];B[cq];W[dq];B[dr];W[cp];B[bq];W[bp];B[eq];W[hq]C[Daniel: Big mistake by W.  J15 is even bigger now with the wall, but W has instead chosen to play a stone that isn't well connected and where B can take away its base.]

(;B[jq]C[Daniel: I like the general idea, although I'm a little worried about the counterattack playing this close.]

(;W[ho];B[jo]C[Daniel: Yep.  Huge move.];W[qo]C[Daniel: Wow.  This is a huge mistake by W.  Locally, W should play Q5 rather than R5, because this invites B R4, but I don't think this is even the right area of the board for W right now.  The top is still big, and F5 is a big move in the lower left.]

(;B[qp]LB[pm:C][on:E][oo:D][po:A][qo:B]C[This feels like the wrong move. I was planning on A before he played B. I probably should have avoided the attach and played a variation. Which would be better C, D, E? or a different move? I lean towards D looking at variations but am not sure.

Daniel: No, this is a great move.  W should not have gotten a good result here.]
;W[po]
(;B[om]C[Daniel: This is a little odd shape-wise, since it's not well connected to any of your stones.  When your opponent is very weak and heavy where you are strong, playing solid shapes is especially important to avoid giving your opponent weaknesses to exploit.]
;W[no]MA[ni][mj][km][lk][ll][jn][jo]C[Daniel: You should definitely help the corner here.  W is already contained, so the important thing right now is restricting eye space locally.  In general, you can draw an imaginary line connecting your two outmost stones, and if W is past them, W is out and can run.  If W is behind them, W has to find a way to live locally.  This is often a good heuristic for deciding how to respond to invasions.  Additionally, if you want to invade, playing on that line is sometimes good, because your opponent will have a hard time determining how to respond.  In this situation, W is well behind the line and can't even get past it with one move, so you don't need to worry about containing W yet.]

(;B[mn];W[nn];B[nm];W[mo]
(;B[ln]C[was this too slow? White ending up eating a large chunk of the corner.

Daniel: I think you have to play this move now.  The mistake was earlier.]
;W[lq]
(;B[op]C[Daniel: B needs to play O3.  This is possibly a decisive mistake.]
;W[nq];B[oo];W[on];B[pn];W[qn];B[pm]
(;W[rl];B[qm];W[rm];B[ro];W[rn]
(;B[rk]LB[rp:A]C[Which is more important stop white with this stone or protect the cut at A. I did manage to live in the corner so it kinda worked out but not sure if that is just because he made mistakes.

Daniel: W can make an eye by cutting at A, so A is bigger.]
;W[rp];B[rq];W[so]C[Daniel:];B[pp]C[Daniel: W lived in sente this way.]
;W[or]
(;B[pr]C[Daniel: I think W can kill this shape.  I can't find a way for B to live directly though.  The ko in the variations is the best I can find for B.]

(;W[kr];B[qr];W[jr]C[Daniel: That was a disaster for B.  P7 was a minor mistake at the beginning, but N6, P4, and S9 were all very large mistakes.  Doing lots of go problems, and studying shape will help you avoid these sorts of moves, and you'll progress in rank very rapidly.]
;B[fo]C[Daniel: This would have been nice earlier, before H3 and H5 were connected underneath.  Now it's slow, especially since B is behind.]
;W[ch]C[Daniel: Nice and solid by W, taking the last big area of the board.  It's hard to see how B can come back now.  However, strange things happen in ddk games, so you never know.]

(;B[cm]LB[je:D][cl:A][hl:C][fm:B]C[I was starting to get really worried about the huge side and corner that he had that was untouched. I chose to invade here and didn't make it far. is there a better way? I listed a few options I can think of. D seems best but it is also most risky since that group is a little weak.  I do have the possible cut through to rescue those stones but still.

Daniel: The best option is to get worried about it earlier.  You had much better options two moves ago before W played C12.  This move is diffiult to recommend because D7 is powerful against it (as played in the game).  I'll put in continuations for your four suggestions.]

;W[im];B[oh]C[I was getting a little worried that my side was going to get reduced so I wanted to protect that.

Daniel: That's a reasonable worry.  The problem is that you're way behind, so you need to play more aggressively.]
;W[jm];B[kn];W[mm];B[ll]C[I was kinda surprised he went for this one. loose ladder tesuji]
;W[ml];B[mk];W[nl];B[nk];W[kl];B[lm];W[kf]C[Daniel: B really needed to play here before W to have any chance.  At this point, W has a commanding lead, so I'm only going to skim the rest of the game, and add comments where you had questions.]

Daniel: The top is definitely alive (W can make two eyes with O19.  B O19 is gote, so W can connect out.)  The group below has two friends to run to, so it's hard to see how that could die.]

C[At this point I resigned I was behind due to the massive area he had carved out in the upper left and didn't see a good way to invade it.

Daniel: Yeah, too late to invade.    I think the biggest problem in your play was the mistakes in the lower right.  There are two things I would suggest to improve on that should help your game tremendously.  First, study shape.  I'll list a few resources for that below.  Second, do go problems to improve your reading.
