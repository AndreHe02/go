;W[pn];B[np];W[qq];B[pq]C[This move is likely better at S5, keeping  white separated - white
takes advantage of the tesuji at S5 next. If Black S5, pressing white into
living small in the corner will give Black good outside influence.];W[ro]
;B[rp]C[Black should S6 before this move - then Black can cut with S7 or S4
next.];W[qk];B[qj]C[S6 is bigger I think.];W[qp];B[rq];W[po];B[qr];W[no]
;B[mp];W[mo];B[lo]C[The white Q6 group is strong enough that this is not a  threat; also
N4 is too open underneath. M4 or M3 might be better.];W[lp];B[kp]C[Unless you  know you can kill the white stone, better not to push
white towards the weak underbelly of the Black corner.];W[lq];B[kq];W[ko]
;B[ln];W[kr];B[pk]C[This helps white make life on the right.];W[ql];B[mq]
;W[lr];B[on]C[White is nearly alive on the right and a connection at P5 is  sente
against the Black group below, so this is not a good placement.];W[oo];B
[om];W[qo]C[This is not the best use of sente. White can't be cut by a capture
here (white recaptures one stone) but it does make the Black corner much
weaker.];B[rm];W[pr];B[or];W[rr];B[ps];W[sq];B[rs]C[Save a move like this for  later - as a ko threat and not forcing the
capture leaves White R5 group with fewer liberties.];W[sp];B[qm];W[rn];B
[sn]C[Connecting at Q7 is sente and captures R8/9. It seals White in too.
Sealing white in and getting all that outside influence is huge compared to
White's 3 points in the corner.];W[pm];B[rl];W[pl];B[rk]C[P8 then S10 still  could have sealed White in instead.]
;W[ol];B[nm]C[Black should worry about  the life of the Q3 group first!]

;W[cm];B[bm];W[bl];B[jh]C[Looks like you're trying to  save N7 group, but you should probably
try to make shape around G10 instead. This move lets White chase it still,
weakening Black's upper right moyo. Better to play a move that threatens
White's left side.];W[mg];B[mi];W[ni];B[li];W[nh];B[mj]C[Black too weak in  the whole upper right quadrant to make this
eye-killing move first.];W[og];B[ph];W[pg];B[mk];W[nk];B[qh];W[ne];B[nc]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]C[This leaves a cut at P16 and Black may not get to connect  R16 to R
12. Maybe P16 is better?];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[sd];W[sc];B[rc];W[ki];B[kj]
C[The corner is much bigger, I'd have ignored this threat!];W[rd];B[se]

;W[ld];B[lc];W[gd];B[kh]C[Small, Black is alive with N6 if White cuts the connection. Use  this
move as a sente attack.];W[ke];B[ob];W[rc];B[qa];W[pa];B[ra];W[gg];B[gi]
;W[eh];B[ei];W[di];B[fh];W[ej];B[eg];W[fi];B[fj];W[ei];B[gh];W[fg];B[fk]
;W[ig];B[sa]C[At first I was thinking seki but now I realize Black can also start
a ko fight to kill in the corner by forcing bent four.];W[hn];B[fm];W[fn]
;B[em];W[dl];B[je];W[gm];B[gl];W[el];B[fl];W[jn];B[kd]C[Black shouldn't worry  here - a White cut should fail.]
;W[kf];B[mh]C[Should save this move as a  minor ko threat. It just helps White here.]
;W[lg];B[gb];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[ha];W[ic];B[jb];W[jc];B[kc]C[Hmm. I'd consider L18 instead. K16 can  connect up or down if White
cuts. If White cuts, then Black G17 is sente eventually.];W[fb];B[kb];W
[gc];B[ga];W[mr]C[White should P4 instead! Then White can P3 or N2 next and Black  is
dead.];B[op];W[jm];B[jl];W[hl];B[hm];W[gn];B[hk];W[in];B[il];W[jg];B[eb]

;W[of];B[me];W[oe];B[le];W[rh];B[mf];W[rj]C[S11 seems to leave more possibilities  than S10: W P16 is still
possible then.];B[ri];W[sj];B[si];W[pi];B[rg];W[oi];B[qi];W[am];B[ap];W
