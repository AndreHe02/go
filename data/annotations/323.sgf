[qp];B[om];W[np];B[nm];W[ql]LB[lq:A]C[This peep seems bad. When black connects,
the white stone becomes almost useless.
The black group will have no trouble at
this stage and, later on, black might be
able to play at 'a', which makes the
five white stones very inefficient..];B[qm];W[qi];B[qg]LB[pg:A]C[I think this is too low. I would play
higher and try to seal white in.
The outside thickness will be worth more
to black than the 10-15 pts in territory
that white gets.];W[oi];B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[rj];B[rk];W[ri];B[qk];W[oj]
;B[ok];W[of]LB[nd:A]C[Here I would prefer to jump to 'a'.
Nevertheless, white is in a difficult
position.];B[qe];W[nd]C[This looks like an overplay since black can
cut (see variation of next move).]
(;B[ed]LB[ic:A]C[This extension seems too small and lets
white off the hook.];W[jc];B[nc];W[mc];B[oc];W[md];B[hc]LB[dj:A]C[Extending in front of the shimari is bigger.]
;W[dg]LB[cj:A]C[But this move is too close to black. White 'a' is where I would play.]
;B[he]LB[lq:A][cj:B]C[This move is thick but perhaps too slow.
Invading at 'a' or pincering at 'b' look tempting.];W[je]LB[dj:A]C[White must make the two space extension on the left.]

;W[aq]C[White should take the ko. It is a "flower
viewing" ko for white.];B[do]C[Black gets the important point at D5];W[ep]
C[Black has the lead.  White's bottom area
is wide open for invasion.  Black should
attack two white stones on left to settle his
group, then invade the bottom.];B[hg]LB[fk:A]C[I would prefer to attack from the
other direction.];W[jg]LB[bd:A][ej:B]C[White is taking a big risk here for very little profit. I would first
play the probe at 'a', then jump out at 'b'];B[ek]C[Black finally attacks to drive white into the solid black position.]
;W[ej];B[jq]LB[lq:A][oq:B]C[Black absolutely must continue the attack.
Even if white manages to live, Black's
thickness will be very useful supporting
an invasion of the bottom. Also, when black
invades, he should play at 'a', aiming at
'b'.];W[gq];B[mr];W[nr];B[hr];W[gr]
(;B[jo]LB[mq:A]C['a' is almost a forcing move since White will lose almost the whole corner
if he doesn't respond.];W[mq];B[lr];W[hq]LB[bd:A][fj:B]C[White has another chance to probe at 'a' and then play 'b']

C[This is too early.  A play at 'a' can still produce something
because the relationship between the two marked stones is
weak.];B[jm];W[rp]LB[jj:A]C[White should play k10.];B[ro]LB[ki:A]C[This is an endgame move. A reduction move at l11 that also threatens
the white left group is the sort of move I would play.];W[jk]C[This move is too loose. Black can still threaten to cut off the white stones
and reduce white's territory.];B[mj];W[mh];B[ns];W[os];B[ms];W[oq];B[sp]
;W[sq];B[so];W[rq];B[ji]LB[ih:A]C[J12 is better.];W[kq]LB[ih:A]C[It seems White wants to give Black another chance to capture
the left side stones.];B[lq]C[Why not L2?];W[kr];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo];W[jp]
;B[ip];W[iq]LB[ih:A]C[A disaster for black, but at least black has sente to play 'a'.]

is avoid giving too many more points away in
the end game in order to win.];B[eg];W[gg];B[gf];W[hh];B[ih];W[ig];B[hf]

;B[se];W[rh]LB[kb:A]C[Gote. Black must play l18.];B[rg]LB[kb:A]C[Capturing is worth 5 points, so White can find a bigger move.]
