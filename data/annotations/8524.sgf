[qm:A]C[When reviewing this game I've noticed that I've missed a honte move at A. With that white R7 stone in place cut at Q6 seems to leave a lot of aji for later.

PETE: That's true, white should play at A at some point but it would be too early. White is alive as is. Save these kinds of move till later when you have lots of support on the outside and the finitely brings you some benefits. At this point it would be hard to make good use of it because the board is so open and black can easily switch strategy and take advantage of your cut, make you thick and build some big moyo for himself. The marke black stone is a bit ackward, actually. Typically black plays joseki at B or C.]
(;W[nc]C[PETE: Yup, the right side to approach from.];B[oc]
;W[nd];B[pf];W[jd]LB[qc:A][qi:B][qj:C]C[This result is great for white, working perfectly with hoshi stone at D16.

PETE: Yes, this was a bit ackward result for black. A-C can still be invaded of course .. so black hasn't built any territory in this game yet :)]
;B[np]C[PETE: unnecessary];W[cn]LB[dn:A]C[PETE: I think I would prefer to play at A instead and try to prevent black from building too much influence towards the bottom-center.]
(;B[cl]
(;W[en]LB[cq:A];B[fp]LB[fp:A]C[PETE: Often times when I hear Dan players review moves like this, they say that this is good for black as the stone at A builds a lot of potential terroritory (4th line). Black's bottom right corner is very strong so if white later on tries to jump into the lower side, the fight will be hard for black and black will likely force white to live with just a few points there. So just be aware in your games that letting black do this is expensive :)]
;W[dk]
(;B[dm]LB[dd:B][ck:A][cq:C]C[I've never seen this move before. It seems too aggresive. I've managed to steal the corner and make some influence (although weak) at the same time. Was there a better answer for white here?

PETE: Yes, too aggressive. Best thing to do here is to just look for the move that black omitted, try to figure out why that move is important in joseki and then try to figure out if you can take advantage of that move missing. Normally black plays at A. So one possibility to consider of course is white playing at A now. This would be wonderful outcome for white as the two white stones would nicely face the stone at B and white can always jump into the corner at C.]

(;W[ch]LB[ck:B][el:A]TR[em]C[Is this pincer right? I wanted to utilize and help my E9 stone.

PETE: thing to note here is that the marked stone is not really helping with anything. Black can easily cut both of those stones off by playing at A. Secondly, wouldn't it be nice to now have a white stone at B already? 
Thirdly, I think at this point I would prefer to give black the left side and take a strong lead on the outside. See variation.]
(;B[cd];W[cc]LB[df:A]C[PETE: as white I would prefer to take the outside with A.]
(;B[dc]LB[cb:A]C[This again looked overly aggresive, yet I think I didn't do the right thing here. I have hard time visualizing outcomes in cross-cut situations like these. I've heard sometimes that after cross-cut you should nobi.  Are there some rules of a thumb for deciding which direction to take? I'm not even sure that logic applies here, so close to the corner. What is the best move here?

PETE: This is very complicated. There is only one rule I'm ware of in cross-cuts which is: on the first move, nobi. It does not ally 100% of the time and which direction you extend in varries with each position. I think a lot of this falls under joseki studies and the rest has to be just read out. There are bunch of patters, I'm sure but I never had time to learn any of them :) According to the joseki site I sometimes use, the next move for white is at A: http://brugo.be/joseki2.php?pid=10015&mirror=0&color=b&invert=0&version=002

Also, there is a book on cross-cuts: ($16): http://www.slateandshell.com/SSRH001.html]

PETE: yes, A would be better.]

(;W[fb]C[PETE: this might be too slow of an offense.]
(;B[fd];W[gq]LB[hn:A]TR[ch][dk][em][en]C[I felt I was still behind, so I needed to invade as well. I've chosen bottom, because it seemed black would make a territory there more easily than on the right side.

In retrospect it may have been a mistake to invade there at all, because the marked stones were still weak. Being forced to manage those two weak groups (marked one and the invading one) caused a major loss of potential in the center.

PETE: yes, I agree that invading the bottom will hurt the marked stones. I would go with the right-side as well (or a reduction at say A that does two things: reduction and helps the marked stones).]
;B[fq];W[jp];B[iq]LB[jn:A][gq:B][fr:C]C[PETE: black is being nice. I would have attacked at A and prevented white from getting out. The stone at B is not really helping even if white connects it with the K4 stone. The stone at C will prevent white from forming an eye under stone at B anyway.]
;W[ip]TR[em][en]C[PETE: yes, good to try to reach out towards the marked stones.]
;B[gp];W[hp];B[hq];W[jq]LB[hn:A]TR[im]C[Would a jump at J7 be better than K3?

PETE: yes, the right idea. I would play at A to get closer to the two stones.]
;B[gn];W[lp]C[PETE: jump out is still best move.];B[mp];W[lo]
LB[hn:A][jn:B]C[I'm not entirely happy with the shape. Any suggestions on how to make that invasion better?

PETE: earlier I mentioned reduction at A and playing on the right-side. Bottom is a tight spot. If you try to go in there, you have to play more losely. Don't worry about getting getting some of your invading stones cut off as long as you get a strong position. Right now black could play at B and give white a LOT of trouble. White is so thick now that he will only either save or lose all those 6 white stone there. So the risk is high.]

SQ[ch][dk][em][en]C[With this move I develop my points in the center (which sounds silly), but mainly I don't want black to make his influence on the right bigger.

PETE: this is a gote move that is fairly big but there are more urgent moves right now. For example, playing at A can force black to run out while pushing white along. That should help the marked white stones (in sente). You should really focus on trying to save at least one of these groups now. Don't worry about black making moyo gains right now.]
;B[og];W[ng]LB[oh:A]C[As I see it, this way black didn't get from his right side as much as he wanted.

PETE: Typical way for black to respond to a move like this is to play at A next. This is 5th line territory - VERY NICE for black. Try to avoid pushing black from behind .. especially this high up.]
;B[bh]LB[eh:A]C[PETE: this will help white should have attached from above .. maybe at A.]
;W[eh]LB[fd:C][dk:A][jp:B]C[With the B group being weak I didn't want to risk black having sente moves against A from the right side, enclosing B at the same time, so I've jumped. This move may also allow to attack black C group later. Is that logic sound?

PETE: yes, I think this is a good idea!];B[ci]C[PETE: black is being so nice :)]
;W[di]C[PETE: yes, good, keeps white connected.];B[cj]LB[jn:A]
C[PETE: black is securing grand total of 4 points!! Black would be better off attacking white at A.]
;W[dj];B[ck]C[PETE: with this move black earned exactly 1 point in gote :)]
;W[gm]LB[fe:B][gm:A]TR[el][em][en]C[I wanted to protect against the cut at E8, but it seems I haven't chosen the best way, because I've hurted my bottom group. This way I've lost a lot of potential in the center. Was that the mistake that cost me a game?

PETE: Yup, you right, this is not a good way to do this. Few things to realize: 1) the two marked stones are very weak now and if they get cut off, that's ok. You can maybe trick black into thinking you care about them and have him spend 6 moves capturing them while you secure your two big groups of stones.   2) move at A invites black to build a strong position facing the bottom white stones -- that's not going to help them :)   I would recommend playing at B. This will force black to run out and help you with at least one of your groups. If you can end in sente there, you should be able to get a move that helps the bottom group as well.
This move alone did not cost you the game. I think the fact that you have two weak groups is why the game is hard to manage.]

Any overall comments on the game?

1. Make sure you try to count the end-game points you win / lose with each move as you chose them. 

2. Try using reductions instead of invasions in your next few games and see what benefits they have.

3. Avoid having two weak groups. I think black could have been a lot more mean to white in this game and killed at least one of the groups. If you find yourself with two week groups, try to connect them.

4. You missed a weak black group up top - it would have helped to attack it in time.

Overall very interesting game!!]N[RESULT])
