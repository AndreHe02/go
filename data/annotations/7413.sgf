;B[qd]C[[Nexik\] Hi. I hope my review will help you];W[dp];B[dd]
;W[qp];B[op];W[qm];B[qq];W[rq];B[pq];W[qj]C[Is R10 actually good in this situation or was R7 maybe already questinable?

[Nexik\] Personaly I like white because he is much faster than black in opening, but overall situation is even]
;B[rr]C[I considered S2 mild, but result made me doubtfull of ignoring it...

[Nexik\] S2 is huge and important play for black, but f course white will ignore this move and seek speed in opening]
;W[od]
(;B[pd]C[Black plays this answer often, is this ok?

[Nexik\] Move itself is ok, but in this opening R14 looks better. Look at variation]
;W[oc]C[Later, again, I thought thatP15 might have been better for overall influence and connecting right side.

[Nexik\] On right side your stones are on the 3rd line, so building moyo there is limited. In game you get nice result, because you took a lot of territory and black build thickness towards your strong position on the right side.]

;B[ol];W[ql];B[om];W[jq]C[I felt going in as necessity but is high pincer actually better here?

I also felt uneasy to go too close because of my invadable big ogeima shimari but could H3 give good result for white, invaded black or not?

[Nexik\] close pincer is less complex, black can invade at 3-3 anyway.]
;B[cq];W[dq];B[cp]
(;W[fo]C[Looking now D5 seems more playable for white. I just wanted to run after sudden inspiration (and even liked the result for a while).

[Nexik\] This move is very bad you need to play D5. Variation]
;B[co];W[dr];B[do];W[ep]C[[Nexik\] White is painful];B[dm];W[cl]
;B[cr];W[hp];B[ds];W[es];B[cs];W[er]C[[Nexik\] White lost in fight]
;B[ro];W[qb]
(;B[rp]C[[Nexik\] Huge mistake, black should play R12. Variation]
;W[qg];B[mf];W[le];B[oi];W[rf];B[pe];W[ff]C[[Nexik\] small move, the biggest area is on the bottom side]
;B[fn];W[go];B[eo];W[fp];B[dh]
(;W[ci]C[[Nexik\] This exchange is good for black. Black can play monkey jump, so playing for territory here is bad idea. White should play from outside and start fight. Variation.]
;B[fh];W[dg];B[jc];W[kc];B[bn];W[dl];B[bm]LB[af:A][aj:B][mq:C]
C[[Nexik\] If your territory have two holes it is better to play tenuki, move at C is biggest on the board]
;W[bl]LB[al:A][af:B]C[[Nexik\] last two moves are meaningless, bacuse after black A and B white territory is very small. Variation.]

(;B[lq];W[ko];B[kr];W[jr];B[ae]C[I didn't like the fact that I answered all the blacks moves obediantly. Still I found no other solution feeling they were too big to just ignore.]
;W[bf];B[kg];W[km];B[jb];W[kb];B[ka];W[la];B[ja]
(;W[ob]C[Q18 might have been best for white instead?

[Nexik\] Your move is thick and ok. Q18 can be risky. Variation]
;B[kk];W[pi];B[al];W[ak];B[am];W[bh];B[ln]TR[bh]LB[bj:A]C[Better way than to connect? J7?

I was preoccupied by hopes of getting something out of F6 cut with (or without to save liberties?) C6 threat.

[Nexik\] Of you planed to cut at E6 that marked stone should be at A. Variation]

(;W[kn];B[qn];W[jd];B[ic];W[oh];B[rm];W[rl];B[mh];W[oj]C[I felt opportunity to reduce black center but would O11 (or something else) have worked better?]
;B[ni];W[nj];B[mj];W[nh];B[mi]
(;W[nk]TR[km]C[[Nexik\] mistake, marked stone give you enough to enter center you should attack two black stones on the left. Variation]
;B[hh];W[kq]C[Should this have been M4 or maybe somewhere else?]
;B[lr];W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[lo];W[kp];B[np]
(;W[mm]C[[Nexik\] this is about ten points center is bigger. Variation]
;B[il];W[hk]LB[ek:A]C[[Nexik\] Risk black can play at A and start very compicated fight]
;B[ik];W[hj];B[ij];W[hi];B[ii];W[fj];B[gi];W[gj]LB[fl:A]C[[Nexik\] Play at is better for shape]

[Nexik\] White play very good opening had a lead, until bad play on lower side and game was even but after answering a lot black small moves (yose) in middle stage of game black take solid lead, later both side play a lot mistakes in yose, but black was much more luckly in the end and won by 1,5.
