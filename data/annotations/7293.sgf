C[Dear reviewer,
my name is Anton. I like to have reviewed this game. I am 3k on KGS and playing black here.
There was a lot of fighting in this game and I am not sure I can keep my mind clean during the fight on goban. But I realize this is rather psychological then go problem. :) From review I would like to know what I should improve in my Go.

Hi :) I think we have played a game on kgs recently. Not sure who won...]
;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[cn];W[fq];B[dk];W[bp]C[W has no good reason to play here now, its more of an endgame move.]
;B[bo]C[I am not sure this is correct time for that attachment. Correct?

This is also small. White should not respond, its just very little points.]
;W[co];B[bn];W[dn];B[dm];W[em];B[dl]C[I was satisfied though since opponent did't answer C3.]
;W[en]LB[ed:A]C[I like the result from black side more. He is strong, has a4-b3-a2 endgame and a sente.

Since white cannot create a good moyo in one move, I would prefere playing at A, which is huge.]

(;B[qn]C[Is it right approach? I was thinking about O4 but I chosen this side since I like when opponent have one big territory what he should defence in all cost.

Generally its correct to kakari from your strong side (the Q16 stone). So yes.]
;W[jq]LB[on:A]C[I was surprised by white's answer and played double pincer.

This is an awful move. I guess no comment needed on it.

Since white is overconcentrated on the bottom, I would suggest overconcentrating him even more by pressig at A and making your moyo at the same time. And as Dino would say, its more solid.]

(;B[np]C[What I dont like about this move is that you play it into his very strong possition. Maybe going for san-san directly would do the job better.]
;W[pn];B[pm]C[I am not sure should I play Q7 before or play san-san directly.

Y, its joseki];W[on]
(;B[qq]LB[qo:A]C[joseki is A. It creates more complicated shape, but maybe its more points for black.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[qo];B[ro];W[po];B[rm];W[om];B[jp]C[I decided not to invest move  for good shape on Q8 and reduce his moyo immideatelly. I am not sure how though. Should I play Q2,P2,R2,P3 before? Should I attach L3 instead or just play shoulder hit at L4?

First of all - Q8 is almost mandatory. It makes a huge difference in influence and your territory on the right side. Its the right move.

Secondly - Q2... is an engame and a bad ajikeshi, you dont want to play it. Its quite possible you might like having O2 in sente.

Thirdly - white is strong, and, whats more important, low. So this moyo is perfect for reduction from above, not a deep invasion.]
;W[kq];B[nr];W[or];B[lp]LB[jl:A]C[Heavy. Your stones are as good as dead. It would still be best to leave them and play around A. Problem is that now you have already lost a lot of points in the lower-right corner.]

(;W[kp]C[White feels like he has to defend, which is not the case.]
;B[ln]C[I was satisfied with a light shape.

Yea, its happy now. But. You have taken some white points, but lost in the corner and your stones are still not very strong. A reduction woud create same territory result, but would be no risk.]

C[Building this wall is a very good result for white. Its because you lost initiative by R9]
;B[lk];W[lj];B[kk];W[kj];B[ik]C[This is probably mistake. Result was bad for me. But I don't like his growing wall.

No, nothing wrong about the jump.];W[jk];B[jl];W[jj]
(;B[km]C[But no reason to play here.];W[il];B[im];W[hl];B[hm]
;W[ll];B[gl];W[hk];B[gk];W[hj];B[jn]C[Huh, why making a ko? Connection at K7 would do.]
;W[kl];B[ml];W[jm]C[Now you are in trouble... White cant loose anything.]
;B[gn];W[kn];B[jl];W[nn];B[mn];W[jm];B[oq];W[qr];B[jl];W[ql]
;B[rl];W[jm];B[os];W[pr];B[jl];W[rp]C[White cant even take these stones as its tiny. He should have played an attachment at Q16.]
;B[lm]C[I was satisfied. Not sure opponent played big enough ko threat.

Yep, its not bad. Still, the ko was completely unnecessary.]
;W[so];B[qj];W[rn];B[qg]C[This is very nice, white's wall is ineffective.]
;W[ed]
(;B[ec];W[fc];B[dc];W[fd];B[cf]C[You can see you are shrinking your own territory.]
;W[jc];B[dh]C[Later I realized what D12 is slow. Should I play M17 before?

M17 is only inviting a san-san, its wrong. P17 is better.];W[nc]

(;B[ld]C[Why this? Especially when you want to play in the corner?]
;W[ne]
(;B[pb];W[pf];B[qf]C[M16 stone is not in a good possition.]
;W[pe];B[od];W[nd];B[nb]C[you cant possibly ignore Q15.. There is no way to make up for the points you will loose in te corner.]

(;W[je];B[ie];W[fg];B[jf];W[ke]C[Now the stones on the left became a nice target.]
;B[kf]LB[kh:A]C[You should keep this in reserve. A move around A can also become a sente.]
