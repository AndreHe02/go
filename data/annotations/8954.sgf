C[Hi, reviewer. Thanks for accepting my game :D.
I am mrgomez and played black in this game.

I recently started reading Attack and Defense, and thought this would be a nice moment to try it out. One of my main flaws has been trying to kill every invasion, so this time I tried to benefit from invasions. I was actually doing well in the first 50 moves or so, but then I think I let him get ahead too much, not to mention the three stones I lost in the center (yeah, I know... silly mistake... I have trouble reading those >.<).
Anyways, I feel I could've used my power better, so that I wouldn't have been forced into that awkward mistake.
Since I don't have much experience at A&D nor fighting, I would appreciate a lot if you could avoid complicated sequences. Thanks!

Alex: Thanks for sending this interesting game for review!  I think you were ahead right up until when you lost those three stones.  There were mistakes from both sides, and I've pointed out some places where you could have used your influence more.  Remember that you want to push your opponent's weak stones into your strength: that often means playing your attacking stones on the opposite side (moves 7, 25, 57, 105, 111, 119).

You mustn't be afraid of complicated sequences!  It's complicated for both players, so it's an equal contest.  You'll gain more experience and learn more by getting into a few fights.]
;B[pp];W[cc]C[From this moment, I knew I could try an influence oriented game. I have a 4-4 stone and he has a 3-3 on the opposite corner. I even thought of playing a 5-4, but I feel that's still a bit advanced for my current level.

Alex: Your opponent is at the same level as you, so there's no disadvantage in trying out "advanced" moves!  You'll learn best by just doing it and seeing what happens.]
;B[pc]C[Instead, I played a 3-4, aiming to an extension to the upper right.

Alex: This move is OK too.];W[dq];B[pe]LB[pi:a][qi:b][do:c]
C[Enclosure before extension

Alex: Traditionally, yes.  But this move is slow by modern standards: since white has komi, black should look for moves that apply a bit more pressure.  If you really want an influence-oriented game, you could try Chinese style: 'a' or 'b' (O11 or R11).  Another move worth considering is 'c' (D5).]
;W[pm]C[Alex: I think this is a mistake by white, placing a stone in black's sphere of influence at this early stage of the game.  Next, which move makes best use of black's strength?]
;B[do]LB[qj:a]C[I'm not sure if I should've extended from the upper group before doing this. I was expecting to get a settled group over his 3-4 stone so that I could extend up from it and press his corner from both sides. The only problem is that I didn't know if I would get sente...

Alex: I would have played 'a' (R10) here.  It's an ideal move, extending from your enclosure while attacking white's stone.]
;W[fp];B[cq];W[cr];B[bq]LB[cp:a]C[Alex: This is not too bad, but it leaves a little bit of aji in black's position.  The usual joseki is 'a' (C4) instead.]
;W[qq]
(;B[pq]C[Was this the correct direction?
I don't like how this sequence turned up. I gave him too big a corner. Although I got beautiful thickness, I'm not sure if it compensates for the huge corner, specially when it didn't give me that many points.

Alex: This is the price you pay for not attacking against O7 earlier.  I think you chose the best direction, and the result is actually not as bad as you think.  See variation for the other direction.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[ro];B[qn];W[rn];B[qm];W[rm];B[ql]TR[pm]C[Alex: The good news is that white's stone at O7 has turned into a wasted move.]
;W[fr]
(;B[kp]C[He didn't extend, so I did. Was this too far?

Alex: No, not far enough.  See variations.];W[mp]LB[iq:a][jd:b]
C[After white played this, I doubted if my extension was the best.
Specially when I didn't know how to answer. I didn't like the aji at Q5, so I decided not to drive N4 towards my wall, but I was dissatisfied with the result. This is where I tell you I could've made a more efficient use of my thickness.

Alex: You shouldn't be so nervous!  You've built up some strength, and white has played inside your sphere of influence: this is exactly what you want!  Driving white towards your wall is exactly the right thing to do: see the variation for the next move.

White N3 is a mistake: white should have played 'a' (J3) before invading.  But 'b' (K16) is more important than either move.]
(;B[mq]C[Alex: This is too passive.  Play M6 instead: see variation.]
;W[nq];B[lq]
(;W[op]C[Alex: I think this and the next move for white are mistakes.  White can play more aggressively to keep the black stones separated: see the variation.]
;B[oo]
(;W[pr];B[oq];W[or];B[np];W[nr];B[mo]C[I did this to prevent white's O5. I would've loved to tenuki, but O5 would've been terrible.

Alex: I agree.  You actually got a good result here: you've given away about 15 points in the corner in exchange for massive influence.  I'd say that black is ahead at this point.  You just need to use the influence well.]
;W[rk]C[How to deal with this move?
:S
Was my sequence ok?

Alex: Not too bad, but you can improve on it a little bit.  See the variation to the next move.]
(;B[qj]C[Alex: This leaves a slight weakness in your own position.  There's no need for that: see variation.]
;W[qk];B[pk];W[rj];B[qi];W[pg];B[of]C[Maybe my sequence wasn't that bad, because here I got this massive attack on white's Q13. And I didn't have to fear Q10 because I could calmly connect at R13. Besides, P14 started to build a framework on the top. I think this has been my best move (after white's mistake, of course) in a lot of time, so you can understand my frustration when it didn't turn up as I had wished.

Alex: Yes, you're thinking along the right lines here.];W[oi]
;B[og]LB[pj:a][pl:b]C[stronger framework

Alex: Yes, but I'd prefer to play 'a' (O10): it gives you a more solid position in the fighting to come.  Right now the cutting points at 'a' and 'b' (P8) mean that black's position is a little thin; you want to build up thickness to attack the white stones strongly.]
;W[pi];B[pj];W[qh];B[ri];W[rl]C[Alex: Here I think you should continue attacking the white stones...]
;B[jd]LB[qf:a][mh:b][fd:c]C[Alex: I'd play 'a' (R14) in this position. Another possible attacking move is 'b' (N12).  If you really want to make a position on the top, your choice wasn't bad (a 5-space extension!) but I think 'c' (F16) would be even better in this case--think on a big scale, try to work with your influence in the lower right.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[qf];B[qe];W[rh]
(;B[si]C[I cut white there so that I wouldn't let his group live so easily, but I didn't know how to answer his reply.

Alex: This chases white out into the centre.  Here I think the centre is actually more important.  If you play on the outside and white gets T11, then you get a second move on the outside: see the variation.]
;W[nj]C[In here, he got ahead of me, besides threating to save Q7 and (perhaps more important) reducing my group's strength. So, here comes my question: was T11 neccesary? Or should I have extended somewhere like N10?
At that moment, I didn't like an extension because I felt I would be turning my strength into territory right away, which would be inefficent.

Alex: Right, N10 would have been overconcentrated.  You can think on a larger scale: see the variation to the previous move.]
;B[nk];W[mk]C[Alex: This is a good time for you to study the web page http://senseis.xmp.net/?BasicInstinct ...]
(;B[oj]C[I did this to cut at O11, but white saw my intentions first

Alex: This leads to bad shape.  Compare the variation.  You shouldn't be trying to "trick" your opponent like this.  Play as if they can see everything that you can see.]
;W[nl]
(;B[ok]C[Alex: It might be better to stick to your original plan and cut white  See the variation.]
;W[mi];B[ml];W[ld]C[aaaaand this... How to deal with this one? Just when that area started to look like my territory, white invades! So I decide to cap this stone to capture it.

Alex: White has put a stone down in an area where there are seven black stones against one white.  You shouldn't be upset about this.  Also, you shouldn't try too hard to kill the white stone.  If you've been reading "Attack and Defense", then look again at pages 21 and 22.]
;B[ke]LB[kf:a]C[After considering many capping moves, I decided this would be the best.

Alex: It's hard to choose between this move and 'a' (L14)--I don't know which is best.  But your move looks OK to me.]
;W[mf]TR[ld][mi][pe]C[Alex: Here, white is very thin: between the three marked stones (M16, N14, N11) there are three loose connections.  This means there are several possible ways to cut.  You should think carefully before choosing the next move.]
(;B[me]TR[ke]C[Alex: The proverb "strike at the waist of the knight's move" is for where there are no other stones nearby.  In this case, your stone at L15 means that it's better to push through and cut: see the variation.  But actually there's an even better way to cut white: see the other variation.]
;W[le];B[lf];W[jc];B[id];W[ic];B[md];W[kf];B[lg];W[kd];B[je]
;W[mc];B[nc];W[lc]C[Alex: Here you should stop trying to kill the white stones at the top, and continue your attack on white's other weak group.  See the variation to the next move.]
(;B[nb];W[hc];B[ig]LB[jg:a]C[Alex: This is too loose.  You should capture the white stone firmly with 'a' (K13).  This move is the real source of your mistake a couple of moves later.]
;W[mg];B[lh];W[mh];B[lk];W[li];B[jh]C[Yes, I know... misread

Alex: At this point white is definitely ahead.  But it's still not over: the left side of the board is wide open.]
;W[kh];B[ki];W[jg];B[jf];W[kg];B[ii]LB[ji:a]C[Alex: Most of the time you should avoid this shape: it leaves too many forcing moves for your opponent.  Here I'd play 'a' (K11) instead.]
;W[kj];B[ji];W[mj]C[Alex: Now you need to think on a big scale to make up the ground you've lost.]
;B[kl]TR[lk]LB[cf:a][df:b]C[Alex: Saving the marked stone (M9) is only worth a couple of points.  Try 'a' or 'b' (C14 or D14) instead.]
;W[kk];B[jl]C[Alex: This looks like you're still trying to attack the white group.  It just doesn't work here.]
;W[jo]C[Alex: White keeps putting down stones in areas where black is strong!  Once you learn to use influence effectively, you'll easily beat these opponents.  Your next move should be to push the white stone towards your strength...]
;B[ip]TR[qj]LB[ho:a]C[J3 maybe?

Alex: J4 leaves a gap in your position, similar to when you played R10 earlier.  J3 isn't bad, but even better would be 'a' (H5).]
;W[jp];B[jq];W[io];B[hp];W[im]TR[kk]C[Alex: Again, your next move should be from the outside, pushing white towards your strength.  There's no danger of him connecting the marked stones (J7, L9) together.]
;B[il]LB[gn:a]C[And, another running fight... It seems I wound up doing what I was trying to avoid... chasing groups to capture them. I have quite considerable strength, after all. Still, I think I played too soft on white here...

Alex: Agreed.  Instead of J8, play 'a' (G6).];W[gn];B[go];W[fo]
;B[fn];W[gm];B[en];W[hl]TR[kk][ok]C[Alex: Again, you chose your next move as if you thought white was going to connect up.  Take a moment now to consider what you could have done instead.  Remember that the goal of your attack isn't to kill, it's to take territory while attacking.]
(;B[hk]C[Alex: see the variation.];W[gk]
(;B[hj]C[This one didn't matter much, did it? Specially because white's F4 group is eyeless..

Alex: Yes and no.  If you let white play at this point instead, the F4 group gets a lot stronger: see the variation.]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[hq];B[iq];W[ho];B[gp];W[dp];B[co];W[gq]C[I have trouble spotting killable groups, btw...
When I realize I have a chance to kill is when my opponent has already lived... :(

Alex: Yes, white G3 was a big mistake :-)]
(;B[ck]C[Alex: F8!  See variation.];W[el];B[dl];W[ek];B[ch]
;W[hd];B[hf]LB[if:a]C[Alex: This is bad shape, giving white a free forcing move.  You'll have to play 'a' (J14) sooner or later, and you're better off playing it right now.]

;W[ln]C[This time I didn't want to try to capture this one because there's a lot of aji. But, I could've killed the whole group. That's what I meant when I said I have trouble spotting killable groups.

Alex: Now open your copy of "Attack and Defense" to page 10.  Black has less than 40 points of territory here.  White has about 50 (maybe more, depending on what happens at the top left) plus komi.  If you don't capture something, there's not much hope of winning.  So in this situation, you have to try, whether or not you think it works.]
;B[mm];W[mn];B[nn];W[lm]LB[kn:a]C[Alex: This is a mistake: white should have played 'a' (L6).]
;B[ll];W[lj]C[Alex: Now you can kill white, if you choose the next move correctly.]
(;B[kn]C[Alex: I think this shouldn't work unless white makes a mistake.  Try K6 instead: see the variation.]

(;B[fm]C[wrong order, right? :'(

Alex: Right, H6 kills (variation).];W[fl];B[fj];W[hn]C[Alex: White is alive now: game over.
