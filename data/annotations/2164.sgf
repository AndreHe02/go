C[Whor[16k\]:  Here, I play as Black, and end up losing by 3.5.

My concern centers mostly on my strategic approach to the game, and my opponents as well.

Though,
not much in this game, but I find myself having to invade large moyos of
my opponent's in most of my games in order to win (or lose when the invasion
fails).

I seem to have difficulty in building equivalent moyo and
defending them. As you will see in this game, my territory is split into
little ones while my opponent comes off with one huge corner which happens
in almost all of my games.];B[dd]C[dede: Hi, I'm dede, 5k in my country. I hope you'll find this comment useful.


dede: It's common habit to start in right top corner.];W[pp]
;B[dq];W[pd];B[ck];W[co];B[gq]C[Whorl:
I am not familiar with this fuseki, so I'm not sure if G3 is the right move
here.

dede: You must use C9 as kakari stone in this position. D5 and following joseki variations give Black  advantage, because presence of C9 stone blocks White's development. May be C4 is also playable.]
;W[bq];B[cm]C[dede: Slow and useless. White makes easy life playing C2, or jumps to the center. Black should play big move, for instance O17.]
;W[cr];B[dr];W[eo];B[dh]C[dede: Bad shape. C13 keeps stones together.]
;W[fc]C[dede: now any response will make Black overconcentrated or leave bad aji.]
;B[ec];W[eb]C[dede: This move only helpes Black. F16 is much better. It leaves C17 option open. If Black play C14 or D14, White can make nice extension to K16, and if Black blocks the extension playing J17, White can invade at C17.]
;B[db];W[ed];B[dc];W[ee];B[de];W[cg]C[Whorl: What is the best way to answer C13?

dede: After C12, I don't see good follow up for White. The best I found is in Var2.
White should play G16, and if Black play around K-L 16-17, attack this stone.]

(;B[dg]C[Whorl: my aim is to cut it off and kill it :-)

dede: now White lives in or runs away, cutting Black's stones.]

(;B[ai]C[dede: look Var 2 for proper moves];W[bd];B[be];W[ae]
;B[bc];W[df]C[Whorl: Is there any way that I could have killed white's group at C14?]
;B[cj]C[dede: D11 is better, makes White's connection gote.]
;W[eg];B[eh];W[fg];B[fm];W[bn];B[cp];W[bp];B[do];W[cn]C[dede: D6 is the only move for White]
;B[dn];W[bl]C[dede: This move is slow and small. White should start something to counter powerful wall built by Black. O3, or N3 looks good.]
;B[cl]C[dede: Don't forget about aim of the game. That great wall must be used. O4 gives Black a chance. If White responds at Q6, Black can build a huge moyo. If White plays around K4, Black can attack this stone and gain strength, which later will be very useful against lonely Q4 stone.]
;W[bk];B[bj];W[cq];B[jp]C[dede: too shy.];W[dp];B[ep];W[ds]
C[dede: All this moves are yose. Board is big, don't be afraid of losing a few points, when you can earn a lot of territory.]

;B[fk];W[kq];B[kp]C[Whorl: Here,I'm hoping to build a wall for influence in the centre

dede: now White is the one with a great wall, and not using it. After move around M16 White MUST have a lot of territory. If Black plays L17, most of the White's potential would be lost.]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[nq];B[jd];W[da]C[dede: L17 gives Black miai for nikken biraki extension on left and right sides. Now, White should attack Black from weaker side. M16 would be nice move.]

(;B[ih]C[Whorl:
Here, I'm hoping to reduce some of the influence that white's Wall has for
the centre, even though my group is not settled yet...

dede: Black should cut at G12 Look at Var 2];W[qk];B[ph];W[qh]
;B[pg];W[qg];B[oe];W[ij];B[ji];W[kc];B[kd];W[mi]C[Whorl: what should my response be to white's stone at N11?

dede: There is no good response. It's hard to build moyo in center. If you have a target for attack, you can use it for building walls in sente and then close the moyo. Otherwise, your opponent always will find a way in.]
;B[kj]C[Whorl: Here i'm hoping to counter attack into the bottom and cut N11 off from white's base.]

;W[ml];B[ok];W[oi]C[Whorl: My cut is not very successful, so the only chance I have is to make a life for the P10 group]
;B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[qi];B[ql];W[qn]C[Whorl: I think white makes a mistake here in giving up R9 so easily.]
;B[rk];W[om];B[pm];W[pn];B[qm];W[rm];B[rl];W[rn];B[ol]C[Whorl: Is there anything white could have done to Kill my group?

dede: White made a good decision to just surround this group. May be he could reduce Black's stones to one eye, but his own stones at N7 were weak. Result of the fight here would be uncertain.
