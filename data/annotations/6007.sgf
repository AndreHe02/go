C[Hello,

I played that game with whites and I resigned.
I do not see clearly what are my mistakes, but I try to analyse them.

Thanks for your help !

* Hi. My name is Leon Geerdink, and I will try to review this game for you. My nickname on KGS is Creslin, so please contact me there if you have any questions. I will start my coments with *.]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pc];B[pe]
(;W[nd]LB[qe:a][ph:b]C[* This Joseki seems a bit strange to me. I can't say for sure that this is bad, because it's to early in the game, but normally White plays either A or the pincer at B]
;B[qc];W[qb];B[qd];W[ob];B[qi]LB[fc:A][cj:B][qn:C][fq:D]C[Ok, it's my turn to play. Lot of hesitation here :

- (A) approach black corner while extending from white thickness
- (B) to not let black play on the hoshi
- (C) to reinforce white corner
- (D) approach black corner

* I agree. Both A and B look big and are more or less Miai. I don't really like white's result (see previous comment)]

(;W[cj]C[My choice. But I still wonder if it was the good one.]
;B[ic]LB[lc:A]C[If tenuki, black will have a good follow up in A.

* Defending feels to slow. White can always live in the corner. The bottom seems the most interesting side now.]

(;W[kc];B[fc]
(;W[qn]C[I think it's mandatory to play here. I really wouldn't like to let black play here wich would make an extension from his thickness while attacking my corner.

* The corner enclosure is relatively small. Black can still invade. Bottom side looks urgent. Right side is less interesting, because Black has many stones there allready and R11 is low.]
;B[ql]C[And now ?

* White is strong. White could still play first on the bottom]

(;W[jq]TR[qq]C[I think it was the only move. Extending from white corner while approaching black one.

* White still needs a last move to secure the corner. This is why 4-4 point is not used to make territory directly, but to play for influence.
I think White should play a kakari.];B[gq];W[cm];B[cp]C[Ok. I'll try to count now.

Black :
- upper left : 25 pts
- lower left : 20 pts
- right : 20 pts
Total : 65 pts

White :
- upper right : 15 pts
- lower right : 25 pts
- left : 5 pts
Total : 45 pts

My conclusion : I'm late. Did I missed something ?

* I agree. Black seems to have got a better Fuseki then white. White will need to play more actively to be able to win this game.]

(;W[cg]C[* This feels to timid. Since your behind in the game, you should play more actively, trying to provoke a fight.]
;B[lq]LB[mq:A]TR[cg]C[Strong attack here. Maybe I should have played A instead of triangle ?

* If white plays A the corner is still open to invasion.]
(;W[nq];B[qq];W[pq];B[or]LB[nr:B][pr:A]C[I played A, taking the corner.
I think that B, separating black while confining him in the corner would have been better.
Anyway, I'm not very happy here.]
(;W[pr];B[oq];W[op];B[nr]
(;W[np];B[mq];W[jo];B[lo]C[*Now white has problems. The corner is not 100% alive, and white has a weak group at K3 which needs defence. It seems to me that Black has an easy game now.]
;W[nn];B[lm]TR[jo][jq]SQ[qq]C[...I'm really in big trouble here
I'll try to make shape with triangles.
But my corner is vulnerable because of square stone.

Could you explain me what I missed ?

* I think white's main problem is that he was behind after Fuseki. It looks difficult to get a good result now.]

(;W[kn]C[Trying to make shape...

*This looks Aji Keshi.];B[ln];W[gn];B[ip];W[jp];B[hn]

;W[kr];B[nl]C[I'm awfully late. Maybe I should have resigned.

*Ofcourse you can play on, but this looks like a very difficult game for White.]
;W[pm];B[pl]C[reinforcing black.... :(]

(;W[ch]LB[bg:A]C[I think I should have played A.
My move was a bit coward. See variation.

*White must separate, or else Black will gain as much as he lost in the corner.]

END OF MY ANALYSE.

I think I lost at the really beginning but I can't understand how.
Thanks you very much for your nice comments :-)
See you !

                 Arnauld

*This will be my last comment. I think white got behind during Fuseki, and played too timid in the middle game. Black has a big lead and should go on to win this game. If you have any further questions, please find me on KGS.]
