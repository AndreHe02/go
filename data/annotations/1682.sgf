C[NukeMarine [11k\]: Hello, I played this game on as NukeMarine on KGS against johnmeyer.  I played black and won by 15 points or so.  My concern dealt with how I mishandled the thickness I built up early on.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dd];B[pj]C[johnmeyer [12k\]: hi
NukeMarine [12k\]: Hello];W[qf]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: White played odd here in my opinion, eitherO-16 or Q-14 sprung to mind as appropriate replies.


intomyth:

wrong direction. should be o17, because black can play as variation 2.]

(;B[pf];W[qi];B[pg];W[qg]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: He seems to make it easy on me, so I decide to build thickness for later game.]
;B[pi];W[qj];B[qk];W[rk];B[ql];W[rl];B[qm];W[nq];B[qh]C[intomyth:

good move. This position is important to both.];W[rh];B[ph]
;W[rg]
(;B[oq]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: Is this appropriate, seems cautious, K-4 better?

intomyth:

k-4 has no pressure to white. I think m3 is better, if white answers o5, then black can answers m5, if white answers at corner like r3 or q3, black can make a big moyo outside. see variations.]
;W[np];B[rm]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: k-3?


intomyth:

K-3 is better. You should use your thick to attack the opponent.]
;W[jq];B[fc]C[intomyth:

not good. I think G16 is better, because you want contain a big territory, and don't give white a chance to pincer.
G16 is better.];W[ic];B[fe];W[lc]C[intomyth:

your territory was destroyed, and the white is not easy to attack.]

;B[cn];W[ch];B[bf];W[ck];B[en]C[intomyth:

I think play at B18 can kill the white group in the top-left corner.]
;W[cb];B[bd]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: Wasted move right?


Intomyth:

yeah.];W[ad];B[bp];W[cq];B[ib];W[jb];B[bl];W[bk];B[ek]C[intomyth:

good.];W[cl];B[eh]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: Ok, he let me surround him, with all that thickness on the other side of the board

intomyth:

Not so well as you think, because white has stones at top and bottom, the middle field won't be a big black space, and also your big jump has weakness.]
;W[ej];B[dj];W[dk];B[fj];W[el];B[ei]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: I think K-9 may have been a better move in hindsight.]
;W[fk];B[ej];W[gl];B[fp];W[fq]
(;B[bq]C[intomyth:

Of course is g3, because you should cut off the white groups to attack. see variation.]

;W[kj];B[gh]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: Ok, I have a good setup and I just stole his possible only eye]
;W[hm]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: I dismissed this, and messed up later on when white misplayed but j-8 group looked under attack..  The trade off seemed reasonable.]
;B[kk];W[eo];B[fn]C[NukeMarine [11k\]: I know, D-6 instead.  If white had played g-7 instead, I would not even have had this chance, right?]

144 and 146 are very bad moves to the white.];B[sl];W[sj];B[oo]

Bad move! O6 instead.];W[no];B[nn];W[on];B[po];W[mn];B[nm];W[mm]

No use. see variation.];W[nl];B[mk];W[om];B[lm];W[ln];B[km]

172 and 174 are cowardly moves for white. I have to say u have a good luck.]
;B[mh];W[ng];B[nh];W[sd]C[intomyth:

Coward!];B[of]C[intomyth:

Why not N14?];W[nd];B[nf];W[mf];B[ok];W[dc];B[ec]C[intomyth:

of course e18.];W[eb];B[fb];W[da];B[de]C[intomyth:

intomyth:

It's his fault!];W[ea];B[si];W[ri];B[rj]C[intomyth:

So victory goes to you.];W[sh];B[sj];W[cs];B[hq]C[NukeMarine [11k\]:      Waste]
;W[bs];B[ar];W[lg];B[pe];W[og];B[hh]C[Intomyth:

should link the 145 together.];W[oh];B[gi];W[gm];B[oi];W[pm]
;B[pl];W[ds];C[johnmeyer [12k\]: thanks for the game
NukeMarine [11k\]: Close
NukeMarine [11k\]: Good game
johnmeyer [12k\]: yes, take care.  cu
NukeMarine [11k\]: bye

Intomyth:

The game has not end yet!!! The problem of 145 hasn't solve.

At the end of the game, I think black is more initiative at the beginning.  But in the middle,  black played very bad, so give a chance to white to change the situation, and the balance is destroyed, after that white is better than black, but the difference is close. After some bad moves of white, because the number of mistakes black made is fewer than white, so the victory is black at the end.]
