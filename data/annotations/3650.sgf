C[[ The motive for this move is clear: you want to save all your stones (or else you could just play J3 and lose only two stones).  If you want to build some kind of attack on the N4 group, of course its necessary to save everything, but that group has lots of ways to live, so I'm not sure the risk is worth it here.

A simpler way to play is to just J3 and white only loses two stones (J6 and K6). \]]

Once black plays B19, this white group should be dead.  If you saw it was dead, you not try to save it, because you are rudely hoping your opponent makes a mistake, and wasting your own ko threats.  However - your opponent *does* make a mistake, and you missed an opportunity to possibly save this group.  :(
