RE[W+5.50]

C[Dear Reviewer;
I played Black in this game and lost by 5.5 points (the komi was 0.5 point).
I have tried to analyze the game by myself, and comments with questions are inserted in the relevant places;
However any comment from you is welcome.

I appreciate if you summarize the mian points I should improve.

Thanks, Avi

PC: An interesting game - I think you were behind after White's invasion on the right, but you fought back to keep yourself in the game. A couple of general points:

(1) In the early fighting on the right, there were a couple of points (moves 23 and 33) where you seemed to change your mind about your objective half way through a sequence. This usually leads to some stones being inefficiently placed.

(2) In the fighting on the left, you had two weak groups to look after. In a few cases you played moves that defended one group in a way that forced White to weaken your other group (a "family feud" as Otake calls it).  You also don't seem to have considered (at move 47) playing the splitting move instead of approaching the top left, which would have avoided the situation.]

;B[od];W[nb];B[me]C[I guess this is quite routine up to this point.]
;W[qm];B[np]TR[pj]LB[qo:A]C[Is it a proper response? May be R5 first? It seems there was no enough pressure on the invading stone.

PC: With the Q10 stone in place I would play R5 ('a') to keep the invading stone weak.]
;W[rp];B[qq];W[rj]C[It looked to me during the game that 2 large knight extensions are a bit too big, but I did not find the proper continuation.]

(;B[qk]LB[qi:A][rh:C][ri:B][rn:D]C[PC: I don't like this sequence: it strengthens White and leaves you with bad shape. An alternative is to play Black 'a', White 'b', Black 'c' (see the first variation).

Note that if you want to play 'd' you can do so immediately - see the second variation.]
;W[rk];B[ql];W[rl]
(;B[rn]C[I do not like this move. It capthure the S4 stone, but it would better to play Q7 and seal the White group from acces to the center - what do you think?

PC: Q7 would be more consistent with the previous two moves - if you wanted to play S6 it would have been better to play it straight away.]
;W[qn];B[ro];W[qo];B[qp];W[rm];B[rq];W[qh]LB[pi:A]C[PC: Could also be at 'a'.]
;B[on]TR[pj][qk][ql]LB[cj:C][fq:B][oh:A]C[Trying to restrict the White group somehow

PC: This looks wrong to me: it's very close to your strong stones and isn't properly connected to your weak marked stones. White could answer at 'a', getting out into the centre anyway with possibilities of attacking both the centre and top right stones. I'd either play 'a' myself or ignore this area for now and take a big point on the left, e.g. 'b' or 'c'.]
;W[om]
(;B[nj]C[Is O7 better (see variation)?

PC: Yes. You played P6 to shut White in; ignoring White's P7 stone is inconsistent with that.]
;W[nn];B[pn]
(;W[nl];B[oh]LB[ol:D][pk:C][pl:B][pm:A]C[Should Black play Q7 instead? I was afraid of P12...

PC: If you play Q7 ('a') you'd probably get White 'b' Black 'c' White 'd', as otherwise you could connect your weak centre stones to your bottom right. That would mean you'd get sente to play P12 anyway.]
;W[og]LB[pg:B][ph:A]C[PC: This looks like an overplay, as White can't answer your move 'a' with the natural replay 'b'.]
;B[ph];W[qg];B[pg];W[pm];B[jq];W[hq];B[jo]LB[cj:B][lq:A]C[PC: This seems a bit slow - you can easily handle the invasion at 'a'. I'd prefer to play 'b'.]
;W[ho]LB[cj:B][cq:A]C[PC: Also slow, given that 'a' and 'b' are both open to Black.]
;B[cf]LB[cj:B][fc:A]C[Since the top is open, I thought the proper approach is from this side.

PC: I agree this is better than 'a', but it's obvious that you're going to get pincered, so I'd prefer the splitting move at 'b'.]
;W[ch]LB[dh:A]C[Now invading the corner will allow White to dominate the bottom left, so I jumped out and  pincered.

PC: The problem here is that you're pincering within White's moyo, so both the approach move and the pincer end up weak. I think you're right not to invade the corner (see first variation), and the contact move at 'a' doesn't look too promising either (second variation).]

(;B[ef];W[fd]
(;B[cj]LB[di:A]C[PC: 'a' is usually an option in this position, but here I think it gives White too much territory (see variation).]
;W[di];B[cm];W[co];B[dj]LB[em:A]C[PC: This induces White to weaken your other group. It would be better to play 'a' without this exchange.]
;W[fi];B[em]TR[di][dj]C[Looking at now, I think E10 is better, what do you say?

PC: I think E10 has the same problem as the marked exchange: it induces White to weaken your other group. I prefer your move.]
;W[dn];B[dm];W[ej];B[bh];W[bg]
(;B[bi]TR[cf][ef]C[May be C13? I cannot see a good continuation for Black (see variation)

PC: I prefer your move to C13. You're weakening the marked stones again, but you do have the option of invading the corner.]

;W[fg];B[fh];W[dg];B[eg];W[md]C[This was painful, but I cannot see how Black can prevent White from taking over the top]
;B[le];W[ld];B[ke];W[kd];B[je];W[id]C[I guess White is leading here:

Black:
Top left: 4 points, Bottom right: 25 points, Left side: 10 points, center: 25 points; Total:64

White: Bottom left: 25 points, right side: 10, top: 25, top left: 10, and some potential of 5 point in the center. Total: 75

PC: Yes. I think you're overestimating White's right and Black's left a bit, and probably the Black centre too, but White's definitely ahead here.]

(;B[gp]C[Is it the right invasion point? Is F3 better?

PC: My first reaction was that F3 ought to die, but it does actually seem to live without damaging your bottom right or left side too much. Assuming I haven't missed anything, that would make F3 a better move.]
;W[gq];B[fp];W[fq];B[hp];W[iq];B[ip]TR[fp][gp][hp]LB[jp:A]C[PC: 'a' would secure more territory; your marked stones could still connect to one of the two neighbouring groups.]

(;B[mo]C[Is this bigger than saving the R9 stones?

PC: Saving the R9 stones is about 6 points gote. N5 (compared to N4 for White) increases your bottom right territory by about 5 points and decreases White's centre by about the same, so it's a few points bigger than saving the R9 stones.]
