C[Dear reviewer,

this is a game I (black) played on KGS. I set up quite a large framework, with intension of making some territory by attacking white after he invades. But it seems I didn't handle it all that well.

So I would mostly like to know how should I have dealt with the invasion, but any other remarks about my or my opponent's play will also be appreciated.

Thank for your review!

--- Hi. My name is Vinyoo. I will be your reviewer.

Yes, you have some good framework in the middle gamel. However, your attack leaves too many weak groups of your own behind.

Please take a look at the review and let me know if you have any question.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]
(;W[eq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]TR[fp][eq]C[--- This sequence is not usual pattern for white. 

The corner is still not secured yet. It is more normal to leave the marked exchange alone. See the variation.]
;W[fr];B[gr];W[er]C[--- White did secure the corner, but now he lost sente (initiative).]
;B[fc];W[fe]TR[hc][cf][df]C[--- White F15 is a bit ambitious in this situation. Normal white moves are shown in the marked positions.

This white move aims to build a framework, but black can enter space between top and bottom white stones easily around C11.]
;B[jd]C[--- This black move is a bit too wide. Since white shape is strong, you should keep a strong shape to prevent white cutting.

The normal move would be around H16.];W[pj]
(;B[fj]C[--- This is a weak move. It does not take territory or expand your framework or attack or invade.

If you want to invade this area, C11 looks OK. You can settle with 2-space extension from either side. See variation.]
(;W[cg]C[--- White should probably play at D10. See variation.]
;B[cc];W[dc];B[db];W[eb];B[cb];W[ec];B[be];W[cf];B[qn];W[hc]
;B[jc]C[--- This "iron pillar" shape does not connect well with Q16 stone. Also, it is a bit too close to enemy's strong position.

I would suggest Q13 instead of K17 to expand your potential and also pressure lone white stone.]
;W[he]C[--- This move is a bit slow. It aims to attack two black stones at K17. 

However, you can reinforce by playing O16. Then, your area has a lot more potential than white's cramped area around F15.]
;B[ph];W[lc]
(;B[le]TR[kd][ke]C[--- This move allows white to settle down. I would prefer taking white's base. See variation.

Also black has weakness around marked positions. Once white settles down, he may be able to cut you off later. So, black may need to come back to fix this weakness.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[od];B[oe];W[pc];B[qc];W[qd];B[pe];W[qb];B[rc]
;W[rb];B[rd];W[ob]C[I thought that this looks pretty good for me, so I was really disappointed later.]
(;B[nj]C[This doesn't seem right now. Should I have played somewhere on the left side instead?

--- This move looks OK. It tries to seal white's stone off from the center. You have some good potential there.

Probably Q8 is better. It builds huge framework at the bottom half and has good potential to turn into territory.

Building framework by attacking seems to be bigger than playing passively on the left side.]
;W[ql]
(;B[ri]C[--- I think sealing the center with P8 is better. See variation.]
;W[pn];B[qo];W[hq]TR[pj][ql][pn]C[--- Now, since white ignores the right side, it seems to be possible to attack strongly or possibly kill three white stones with a move like P8.

You can do that once you get sente.]
(;B[gq]C[--- Playing H4 looks more natural for black. It prevents white dividing black groups later.

See variation.];W[jr];B[kq];W[lr];B[kr]C[--- No need to push in yet since black loses a liberty with this move.

Just M3 seems to be better.];W[ks];B[nr]C[This seems strange now. Where should I have played?

--- Just play M3 instead of this move. You should try to connect your stones with other groups. M3 also try to seal white off from the center.

Do not worry about 2nd line too much in the opening and middle game unless it relates with eye-shape. Normally, opponents lose points when they try to crawl on the 2nd line.]
;W[jq]C[--- Clever move.];B[kp];W[ip];B[io];W[ho]C[--- Now you are in trouble.]
;B[fn];W[dl]
(;B[gp]C[--- Bad shape. Your stones do not have much liberties and no potential eye shape.

Just play F8 is better.

You may worry about white F5. However, there is no way white can cut you. See variation.]
;W[hp];B[fl];W[in];B[jo];W[gn];B[hm]C[--- Just play G7 is better.]
;W[gm];B[go];W[hn];B[fm];W[mq]
(;B[np]TR[io][jo][jp][kp][kq][kr]C[--- This move comes from the wrong direction. You should look to move from your WEAK group, not from the strong group.

You should jumpt from the weaker group (marked stones) first. Playing N5 seems to prevent white from connecting bottom group with the right group.]
;W[mp]C[--- Good move for white. Try to separate black stoens.]
;B[ln];W[mo]
(;B[nn]C[--- These 1-space jumping shapes are not strong. You will not be able to hold white in.

Playing from a bit further at O7 should be better. See variation. 

This O7 move is still a bit risky. However, if all white groups are connected, you will be in trouble.]
;W[mn];B[mm];W[no];B[oo]
(;W[op]C[--- This is too easy for black. See variation.];B[on]
;W[nq];B[oq]LB[ll:A][lm:B]C[--- You should just fix your weakness first, such as at M8 or M7.]
;W[lm];B[km];W[ll];B[jn];W[jm];B[jl];W[im];B[kl];W[pp];B[qp]
;W[po];B[pm];W[np];B[nl];W[qm];B[nm];W[pl];B[om];W[oi];B[hl]
C[This was the final mistake. It would probably be better at M9.

--- Yes, you should play M9. 

Still, it would be difficult for you to kill center white group since your stones on the left (F8 group) is still weak. At least, you can hope to attack either center or right white groups and kill one of them.]
;W[lk];B[il];W[nk];B[mk];W[ok]C[I resigned here.

--- In this game, you created a good framework. However, in your subsequence attack, you created weak groups and allowed white to cut you off into pieces.

In your future games, you should always look for your own weaknesses before attacking. If there are weaknesses, you should make sure that you have a way to deal. Otherwise, fix them first to be able to attack strongly.

To get stronger in general, you should play a lot and review your own games. Doing tsumego also helps tremedously.

Hope the review is helpful.])
