AB[pd][dp]C[Skamus:

Hello Hagios. I'll be commenting your game. My name is Diego Guerrero and I'll mark my comments as SK. Nice to meet you, I hope to solve all your questions and if you have any doubt after this you can email me or talk to me on KGS.
Please excuse my bad english.];W[dd];B[qp];W[oq];B[mq];W[oo]
LB[pn:A][mq:4]C[SK: The pincer at 4  is a really severe move, after this pincer there is only 1 good continuation to keep the spirit.]

(;B[qn];W[pm];B[qm];W[pl]
(;B[ql]LB[qn:A]C[H: Should I have jumped out at R9 instead here?

SK: The problem here came after the move at A (Move6) wich allows W to flatten the right side and attack to your pincer stone.]
;W[pk];B[qf]
(;W[qq]SQ[mq]C[SK: This doesnt seem the most propper move for W. W should use the wall he just build to attack the marked stone.]
;B[rq];W[qr];B[pp];W[op];B[jq]
(;W[fc]C[SK: W has lost a lot after Bk3. He needs to try something bigger than f17.]

(;B[cf]LB[cj:C][qj:A][cm:B]C[SK: I'm sorry but this doesnt seems to be the best move. Right now I think that the jump to A is vital. Another big move is B, maybe C to develop your lower area.

On variation A you can see what I think about  your question on move 42]

(;B[cn]LB[cm:A]C[SK: This move seems soft to me. I would play A. The variation will explain :)]
;W[hq];B[fq]LB[hr:A]C[f3 does allow the connection with A. But the corner is open to an invasion. That's why I like e3 more.]
;W[ho]
(;B[lo]LB[jo:A]C[SK: Sorry but I think A is better shape. Keeps attacking to W.]

(;W[mn]C[SK: This is bad direction of play. W should push B to face his wall.]
;B[ln];W[jp];B[kp];W[jo];B[iq]
(;W[ip]
(;B[kl]LB[qj:A]C[H: This development felt slow.  Is there a better way to develop this area?


SK: Well... In the variation at move 20 I think B was nice. But here it's pretty hard to choose a move. I would probably play A  maybe some kikashi first.]

C[SK: This is a dangerous exchange! it weakens the group at the left... This is not the propper timing.]

(;B[jc]LB[ob:C][pb:D][nc:F][qc:E][ch:A][ho:B]C[SK: Right now this move may seem big. But your group is pretty weak, you should strenght it so you can try to attack to A and B. Remember that these long extentions (K17) have wekaness at a lot of points.]

(;W[eh]LB[mc:B][di:C][hk:A]C[SK: This is gote for W... B May play somewhere else.
A is not the same anymore but  maybe an idea to help the group on m2. B  is really big. Or B may probe with C before A.]

;W[mj];B[nl];W[jl]LB[kj:A]C[SK: A is important for B... On handicap, and even games, you must not let your opponent to surround you.You must fight for the center.]

SK: It's pretty hard to say. B seems able to live after a tenuki. you may escape to the center but L10 will die. The exchange seems good enought to me (See variation)
Annyways I would play  this move. W attack on the upper area doesn't seem strong enought to me.]
