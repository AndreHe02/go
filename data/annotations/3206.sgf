C[Dear SGF Reviewer,
I played Black in this game, which I lost horribly. I have a
few specific questions in the file, but mostly I'm interested
in something more general: What strategic weakness do you see
in my play?
Thanks very much for your time,
wegobad];B[pd];W[ep];B[dc]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: good luck ! for you and me !]
;W[oq];B[ce];W[nc];B[jc]C[TA: Very nice  for black.];W[qf];B[oe]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[wegobad - Is this proper? So far, looks ok for Black.

TA: this is alright, since you already have a good extension
to the left.];W[qd];B[cp]C[wegobad - Better at Q18?

TA: No. Q18 is no threat and only an endgame move. Taking hav
of the corner is much more urgent.];W[cq];B[bq];W[dq];B[bo]
C[wegobad - better at C6, or C7?

TA: C6 is also possible, but I thought, this was joseki, too.]
;W[cn];B[dn];W[do];B[cm];W[co];B[bn];W[en]C[wegobad [4k?\]: B5 was a mistake.  too low.]
;B[dm];W[ob];B[pb];W[ne];B[of]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: but i think that move is joseki move

TA: For me it looks a bit strange, that white plays with his
weak group. After Q18, the white corner group is no longer safe.
And the white group at the top maybe will also have a hard life.]
;W[kd]C[wegobad [4k?\]: almost a joseki move, i think... looks similar,
but a little different.
wegobad [4k?\]: that's probably why i played it.  :-/];B[lc]
LB[qh:b][nf:a]C[TA. This does not look good. If white plays there, he only has
a small life. Why not play Ba, W31, Bb? Black will have a nice
game.];W[md];B[ld];W[le];B[ke];W[mg]LB[lf:c][je:b][kf:a]C[TA: Wa, Bb, Wc looks a bit more convincing for me.]
;B[qg]C[wegobad - Can Black get the corner, or is it hopeless?

TA: I am not sure if he can get the corner. But even if he fails,
He will have a good position on the right hand side, which looks
very big as well. So attacking her is a good idea (after white
strengthend black here).];W[pe];B[rf];W[re];B[pf];W[qe];B[rg]
;W[qb];B[od];W[pa]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: i think p17 is better
conbokeuoo [5k\]: do you think so];B[pl]C[wegobad - I felt OK now. White can have upper right corner, and
I can have the right side, and approach the lower right.

TA: I agree. Black is well positined.];W[je];B[kf];W[jd];B[kc]
;W[jf];B[kg];W[jg];B[kh];W[ic];B[ib]C[TA: Looks White likes figthing in blacks influence...]
;W[hc];B[hb];W[gc];B[gb];W[fc];B[ee]C[wegobad - Here I should continue to F18, I think.


TA: Or better E18. But again, I'd prefer a move like K12, which
makes it much harder for white to fight.];W[fb];B[jh]C[wegobad - I guess I can live now with K19. But I didn't.  I thought
I had room for eyes, but after White F18, it seems like M19 will
kill me. This kind of tactical overconfidence often gives me
trouble - I tenuki too soon.];W[la];B[ma]LB[lb:f][oa:e][ka:d]
[nb:c][na:b][mb:a]C[TA: No! I think, you could have lived with: Ba, W67, Bb, Wc,
Bd, We, Bf. It is a pity!];W[mb];B[mc]C[wegobad - I imagined I could either cut at o16 for the Crane's
Nest at N14, or if White connects o16, then I could atari at
M18 then L19 and have an eye at L18. Of course, it doesn't work.
I neglected to notice that I reduced my own liberties.];W[lb]
;B[nd];W[me];B[ja];W[ka];B[jb];W[ng]C[wegobad - Feeling pretty desperate now.]
;B[mi]C[wegobad [4k?\]: looks bad for me   :-)];W[oh];B[ph]
;W[oj];B[nl]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: my groups have a little stronger
conbokeuoo [5k\]: i think];W[og];B[pg];W[pi];B[ni];W[oi];B[qj]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[qk];B[rk];W[pk];B[ql];W[jp]C[wegobad - The K18 clump has 4 liberties, the surrounding Whites
have 8. I thought I could get White to fill his own liberties,
and I thought White would need an extra move because of N19,
but I was dreaming. At this point, Black can resign, because
White has no more weaknesses?

TA: I think you are right.];B[qp];W[po];B[pp];W[op];B[oo];W[on]
;B[no];W[qo];B[rp];W[ro];B[pn];W[pm];B[qn];W[qm];B[rn];W[rm]
;B[so];W[ol];B[rl];W[sm];B[nn];W[om];B[nk];W[ok]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: what a mistake
conbokeuoo [5k\]: i think i have play a terrible move];B[sl]
C[wegobad [4k?\]: good, i'm not the only one :-)];W[nm];B[mm]
C[wegobad - About now, I read out that I was dead if White got
T14.]
(;W[ih];B[ll];W[lq];B[qh]C[wegobad - I played this to save the right side from T14. Now
I felt like I might have a chance again.];W[dh];B[fh]C[wegobad - I did not know how to answer. Is this good? What would
be better?

TA: I think, this is a good idea. Even if you cannot kill anything,
your only chance is a tough fight in the area you are strong.
Maybe you will have some advantages from your dead stones...]
;W[ej];B[em]LB[fk:a]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: my net is terrible

TA: I fyou really want to fight hard, you will need a stone around
a.];W[gi];B[gh];W[hi];B[fi];W[fj];B[gj]C[TA: If you want to cut here (which is a good idea) than you should
not exchange 131 for 132. This makes this cur much more difficult.
Maybe in some variations you would have liked teh opportunity
to play at 132 yourself.];W[gk];B[hj];W[ij];B[hk];W[hl];B[ik]
;W[fl];B[fn];W[il];B[jk];W[go];B[ig];W[hf]LB[he:c][if:b][hg:a]
C[Better capture with Wa, Bb, Wc];B[hg];W[df];B[di];W[ei];B[eh]
;W[de];B[dd];W[ef];B[fe];W[ff];B[if];W[he];B[ie]C[TA; No.];W[id]
;B[ge];W[gf];B[ed];W[cf];B[bc]C[TA: Looks Black is struggeling for life inside his former moyo!
Better B15];W[be];B[cd];W[db];B[cb];W[eb];B[bd];W[dj]C[wegobad - After this, I think White has definitely won. My only
excuses for the next 20 moves are that I'd had no sleep, and
I'm bad at go.

TA: I think the beginning was good, but since the loss in the
upper part, the game was over.
From the strategic part, I think, you should always search for
the decision, if your opponent enters your influence: Do you
want to kill or do you just want to profit. If you want to kill
and fail, this is desastrous, since your oppontent has not suffered
at all. So why not try to stabilize in that way, that your opponent
has still unsecure groups. Maybe later on, he has more of them
on the board (like in this game) and you can profit from joined
attacks.
So my strategic hint for you would be to try to fight very hard,
if the fight is in your sphere of influence. I think you lost
this match because these fights were desastrous.
Good luck for the future!];B[ci];W[cj];B[ch];W[dg];B[bg];W[bf]
;B[bj];W[bk];B[ai];W[ck]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: i think this group can"t live
conbokeuoo [5k\]: do you think so];B[ak];W[bl]C[wegobad [4k?\]: i have so many dead stones, that i feel pretty
silly
wegobad [4k?\]: oh, you don't have to fight ko.  rats.
conbokeuoo [5k\]: but i think this game is very difficult for
me
conbokeuoo [5k\]: yes
conbokeuoo [5k\]: i avoid a fight ko];B[mf];W[nf]C[wegobad [4k?\]: i think i must resign soon  :-)]
;B[lf];W[na];B[mh]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: my group have 6 territory]
;W[kb]C[conbokeuoo [5k\]: and your group have 5
wegobad [4k?\]: no, only 3
conbokeuoo [5k\]: so you can"t win in this capture race])
