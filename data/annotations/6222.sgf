Bottom line is, White is behind by a lot and has to take risks, which means leaving the weak group to itself. Even so, prospects are bad since Black is strong everywhere.]

Well, thanks to whoever reviews this :)

> Summary:

> Pay attention to big points in the opening, starting with corner enclosures.

> Look at the big picture. Grow your moyo if you can (K10 vs. C14). Don't develop in unfertile directions (O17).

> Weak groups are a liability: avoid making them ! When cursed with one, helping it is urgent and should take precedence, otherwise the opponent is likely to profit from it.

> This also means attacking a weak group is urgent (as long as you can make some profit from it).

> Take time to assess a positional judgement between each fight. It doesn't matter if your count is rough. The point is to pick a conscious strategy based on your perception of the board: simplify when ahead, complexify and take risks when behind.]
