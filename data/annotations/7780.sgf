AB[dd][pd][dp]C[> Hi I'm Huginmunin 4k on kgs, I'll be doing your review. I hope you find it helpfull. Feel free to contact me on kgs.
I'll precede my comments with >



This is a copy of a game played at the local go club.

I'd like to see another's perspective on how black could have played better.

Thanks!];W[qp];B[pn]C[Questionable?

> Yes, P4 works better with your stone on D4, and it is the most common approach.
This move is sub-optimal in this situation];W[oq]

Just pay attention to those empty triangles, most of the time they are to be avoided and usually there is a better local response.
Also try to keep in mind the direction you want to be playing in and try to stick with your plan. Always assume your plan is better than your opponent's :)

Happy playing
