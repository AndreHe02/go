C[hello, i'm black
i have two big questions: i think i didn't play a ggod game in
the upper left. What should have i to do ?
and i think i had to go into white moyo but i don't know when

Hi -- you show good whole board intuition, so many
of the mistakes I will comment on are tactical ones.  We will
get to them as they come.

I did the review in Many Faces of Go and replayed it in CGoban
(which I use for a KGS connection).  Both allowed me to easily
view all of the variations I created.  Anytime I play out a variation
I first mention it in a comment.];B[pd]C[Capslock [10k\]: hi from france]

;W[nc];B[pf];W[kd];B[de]C[i tought that white will play E15 or F16. What have i to play
against F17 (which seems slow)

F17 is a joseki that is old style, but white can
certainly get a reasonable result with it.  Additionally, you
will see there are variations where black can be terribly tricked.]
;W[fc];B[cc]LB[cd:B][cb:A]C[This is correct - white's options are now A or B.]

(;W[cd]C[See variation for white-c18 joseki.];B[dd];W[bc]
(;B[ce]C[This is the first mistake -- see variation.];W[cb]
;B[di];W[po];B[np];W[qq];B[qr];W[qp]
(;B[or]C[This is a joseki, but when you play the chinese opening and have
a stone at r9, you should put more pressure on white. See varation.]
;W[qm];B[nn];W[om];B[fq];W[cn];B[dr]C[D2 is a territorial move.  You want to make a moyo. Hence H4
is probably best here. (J3 is played a lot but it is too low
here)]
(;W[cq]C[I wouldn't have played this way if I were white.  I would play
the variation instead.];B[ip]C[
J4 is usually too ambitious (H4 and J3 are more common) but it
may be ok here because you need to  make your wall useful];W[ck]
C[C9 is a big point that white is happy to take.];B[dk];W[cl]
;B[cj];W[fe]
(;B[pb]C[A little slow -- I would invade first. (see 2 variations)]
;W[ie];B[eg]LB[bh:B][ch:A]C[I can see why you made this move -- if you don't white can cause
trouble with moves like A or B.  But it is slow and having to
make this move is painful.

If you played the joseki in the top left correctly you wouldn't
have to worry about making this slow move.];W[gg];B[ep];W[ne]
C[Now your moyo invasion hopes are virtually gone.];B[ng];W[qj]
C[should i have played Q11 instead of O13 ? But i didn't want white
to extend more his moyo

Yes Q11 or R11 much better.  White's moyo is already big - O13
just slightly reduces the size of the moyo.];B[pl]C[Not good -- white can play S9 and connect from below.  Must play
Q9 or Q10 instead.];W[pj];B[ol];W[pm];B[nm];W[rk]C[This was very bad for you.]
;B[qh];W[nl];B[nk];W[ml];B[oj];W[pk];B[oi]C[Moves 53-55-57 are not consistent with each other.]
;W[ok];B[kn];W[ll]LB[cr:C][be:B][ob:A]C[White M8 is gote.  He should instead play A, B, or C.

This slack move gave you a chance to get back into the game.]

;W[aq]C[B5 is the safe move for white.  You did a nice job exposing his
eye problems but he should have lived comfortably.];B[bo];W[bn]
;B[cp];W[co];B[bp];W[as];B[cs]LB[rr:B][md:A]C[This is very bad -- this is not a threat -- you should play elsewhere,
like A or B.  If black responds then take the ko back.];W[ao]

You play pretty well strategically so there is not one thing
I can say to make you instantly better.  Just a few small mistakes
here and there cost you the game.

I play as sergeant on both KGS and IGS.  Look for me and I will
be happy to play a game with you.

Take care,

(;B[lc]C[One possibility is jumping right in.  Caution: if this doesn't
work your opponent will not only kill you -- he will get a lot
of center influence as well so be careful.

Rule: when your opponent has a moyo - invade only if 1) you can
enter and make two eyes or 2) enter and run out into the center.

If you can do neither of these things, best not to invade but
reduce instead.];W[ld];B[mc];W[nd];B[md];W[me];B[kc];W[jc];B[jb]
