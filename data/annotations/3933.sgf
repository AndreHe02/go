(;B[fq]C[Is it better to move at H3?
no i do not think that was a mistake specially since O3 is low on the 3rd line and you can't go below
it is a good approach move];W[iq];B[cq];W[dq];B[dp]

in fact it is the right area where to play but one line longer]

iagree you go out of the battle field];W[ng];B[kf];W[jf];B[kh]
;W[ni];B[pj]C[I think it is a slow move.
yes but not bad for territory building
in fact it may not be bad at all???
can white really attack the black  group in the middle, that is the main question]
;W[ih];B[jg]C[not to be played
jump directly];W[ig]
(;B[if]C[I think I should play at L10

bad of course
you are going to weaken your own corner group!

this is the game loosing move
before you were winning....
do not cut inappropriately, which you do many times in this game]

nothing is good!!!!
but this is specially bad because black can easily see that whatever happens white escapes]

it is true that white gains the whole corner and the game....so maybe it is better to threaten to live in the corner]

if yes then black has not lost
but i think it is dead]
