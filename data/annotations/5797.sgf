C[Dear reviewer,
first of all, I ask sorry for my poor english.
This is a game that I played on KGS, as white.
I would be very pleased to get some advice regarding my style of playing, expecially in the opening and endgame, when I had many trouble traying to keep balanced territories in the center. (but of course, every other comment is welcome ^^)
Thank you very much in advance,
Andrea


Dear Andrea,
my name is Xinwen, your reviewer. i merely 1 dan only. therefore i couldnt make the best comment for you.

;W[dd];B[co];W[cm];B[eo]LB[cp:C][fp:A][gp:B]C[Xinwen ::: A to C are the choices to respond the black.]

(;W[cp]LB[bo:B][bp:A]C[C4 is good? I didn't feel good, playing it. maybe an extension at F4 was more playable?

xW ::: C4, ,could be good and could be bad depend on your idea. if you fail to do what you wanted to, then it's bad

The usual C4 answer is A /B]
(;B[dp]LB[eq:A]C[I had never seen that before.
I thought about C3, that connect in B5 or force out on the other side

Xinwen ::: neither do i. If im white, i might move "A" But which i think is that most of the player who doesn't really understand this joseki might answer it.]
;W[ep]C[Xinwen ::: Frankly speaking, i don't like E4. you solid the black and you leave cuts.]
;B[do];W[fp];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq];W[dr];B[fo];W[hp]C[is this weak? I was worried for half of the game about G3 that erase my territory

xW ::: as you an see your C4 is not good, didnt do much and yes the shape is weak.]

C[I couldn't come up with anything else that don't let black take corner and make me run. H18 and G18 seems too dangerous

Xinwen ::: it's already obvious after those black stones u helped the black

If u have known it, you shouldnt have done it. Therefore black defintely will take your corner.]

(;W[id]LB[cb:1][ed:A]C[Xinwen ::: i think you should have "A" first before you move at "J16". This is to solidify your shape first, you're having a very weak shape.]

Xinwen :::
Thank you and Sorry that i couldnt make a good review.

I think you should try download Kogo Joseki Dictionary. because u need to improve in your Joseki and Fuseki.

Your Yose is good as Black didn't play well at the end.])
