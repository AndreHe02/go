C[I am black, rated 14k KGS at the start of the game, white was rated 13k

I am mostly interested in my opening. If you see any big mistakes in my fighting/endgame I would also like to know about it.

Sirkut> Hello.  Thank you for submitting you game for review.  I'll preceed all my comments with "Sirkut>"]

(;B[ed];W[ec];B[fc];W[eb];B[fb];W[cf];B[jd]C[Was this too big? I thought it would be ok due to the wall on the left

Sirkut> Your joseki was good here, except that I don't think the exchange was even.  White has recieved a strong position defending a large corner, while you ended up with a wall facing another white corner -- you'll have to defend the other side of the space before you have definite teritory.  

It's also better to attack in a way where you're playing off your existing positions so your attacking stones can have some support.  See variation on move 5.]

(;B[ch]TR[ek][cn][nq][pq]C[Sirkut> This move is a little early.  Q2 or O3 are quite a bit bigger.
If you were defending that side from a possible pincer, then I would have liked C6, or something like E9.  See variation.]
;W[nq];B[oq]C[Should I have pincered here instead?

Sirkut> I don't think pincering would have been a good idea because your corner isn't very strong yet.  If your corner group ended up having to fight for life it would get messy quick!  Here you can just let white expand as far as their comfortable until you're happy with the corner and it will probably be an even trade.]

C[Thank you for taking the time to review my game

Sirkut> And thanks again for submitting it.  I hope you found some of the comments helpful.  I did not have as much to say as I might normally because you wone this game so handily.  You will probably get more helpful advice when the scores are closer.
Best of luck!])

;B[ff]LB[pe:C][dk:A][np:B]C[Sirkut> This joseki has a similar result - white has a strong corner position and definate territory, while black has a wall.  Since the wall now faces your other two black corners, your groups will have an easier time looking for somewhere to run.

I marked a few follow-up moves I thought would work well here.]
