C[sita:
Dear reviewer,

I was completly outplayed in this game and I have realy no idea why. My opponent had quite some groups on the board, but he connected them or lived with them easily and nullified all my influence. There must be a fundamental strategical mistake I made, but I cannot see what went wrong.

ZN:
I guess you may pay more attention to the direction and thickness&weakness after you have grasped the basic skills. You already knew thickness and weakness, attacking weakness group by your own thickness etc. However, please note that the objective of attacking is gain benefit, such as space or eating stones. In all, pay attention to both thickness&weakness also attacking direction.]
;B[pd];W[de];B[pq];W[dp];B[fq]C[Variation 2 and 3 could be considered.]

(;W[qo];B[op]C[Black P4 is correct direction. It would be helpful for F3. In a word, the bottom is right direction. O4 and N4 are also good move too.]
;W[pm];B[cn]C[Black(C6) is the most tough attack for W star(D4).Variation 2 and 3 demostrate the advantage of P4.I recommend variation 4. The reason is that bottom is black's strong side. If W gets left side, not bad.]

(;W[eo];B[cq];W[cp];B[dq]C[Variation 2 could be considered.G5 is common in use in Handicap game. G4 is usually in even game.]

(;W[go];B[ep];W[do];B[hp];W[gp]C[sita: Mh, ok, don't comment on this one, please. :)]
;B[gq];W[ho];B[cg];W[cj]C[C10 is correct direction. But i suggest D10. Line 4 is helpful to attack. Anyway, i cannot say the reason clearly. It is kind of fight feeling. Anyway, firstly, make a decision for direction, and then find for the best postion for move.]
;B[ej];W[di]LB[dl:a]C[correct direction, you do great job. DON'T play A(D8). It is totally wrong direction.]
;B[cd]C[sita: I was completly confused by this move. I would like to block at c15, but turning at e16 later turned out to be difficult because of c13...

ZN:
sure that C16 overplayed. just C15, have a look variation-2. In this kind situation, dont hesitate to cut. Definitely get him to move C15. if so, he makes live free. Here W thicker, so just fight and dont get black easily alive. Actually there are lots of variations here. But W must fight. It is direction, oh, i have to say strategy.]

C[your 42,44,46, wants right side space. your 48,50 wants up side. I dont know what you really want by attacking. Look, this is direction problem.]
;W[dc];B[cb];W[db]LB[nc:a][lc:b][ne:c][pf:d][jc:e]C[54 is slow move. surely move O17.a,b,c,d,e is sequence, if black dont want to white to get space. W just attacks, dont worry.]
;B[kc]
(;W[md]C[sita: I was very unhappy with the situation up to know. I thought that I had to do something with my influence, that's why I played n16.

N16 is correct correct. L17 is wrong move. black only can move N17, then white moves L17. But N16 is not the best point. i recommend O16.see variation 2.]
;B[hc];W[qf];B[oe];W[qc];B[pc];W[qd];B[og];W[le]LB[mb:a]C[64 is slow. B is leading in space. you cannot move this kind. move N18 to get black to make alive and then N12 to cut black to two groups for preparation of attacking.]
;B[ph];W[mh]C[66 is not useful. maybe N11 is better. anyway, from here. White loses.]

;B[kf];W[ni];B[pj]LB[lk:a]C[79 is wrong, if moving M9, either W O11 group or K8 group will be destined to be dead, i think:(]
;W[nk];B[ck];W[bj];B[mj];W[nj];B[ll]C[85 just cut at K7. W will crash.]

KENN [2d\]: tanks

ZN: from Black's 77. Black attacked W's serveral groups and get upper side and right bottom coner. In whole game aspect, at that time, W's groups are weak and Black's are thick. After 77, W has no chance.
Therefore, pay more attention Thickness&Weakness and direction. Deciding direction by thickness&weakness, and then select the best position by your calculating skill and shape feeling.]
