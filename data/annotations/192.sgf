;W[jd];B[jp];W[ce]L[hq][de]C[reid:  the general feeling about the chinese fuseki
seems to be that white needs to be aggressive about
reducing the moyo.  white c15 is a bit slow in that
regard.  something like a (h3) or invading somewhere
around p5 might be more to the point (see "The Chinese
Opening" by Kato Masao for some ideas on how to invade
around there).

Also, c15 seems like it might be better played high, at
b (d15).  That seems to work better both with the upper
white formation and with the stone at c3 (since c3 is
also low).];B[dp];W[cp];B[do];W[co]L[er][gp]C[reid: this move is the  wrong direction.  the normal
joseki has white playing a (e2) next.  I think that's
what white wants to do anyway, to reduce blacks moyo
a bit.  black turning at c5 isn't a problem for white
since he already has c15 to keep this area small.  also,
if black turns at c5, that stone doesn't work very well
with his moyo on the right.  if he plays at b (g4) it seems
a bit odd in relation to k4.];B[dn]C[reid: black is happy to keep on building  thickness
in this direction.];W[cm];B[dm];W[cl]C[reid: this whole side is painfully low  for white.]
;B[dq]L[ek]C[reid: black should continue with a (e9).  but d3
is pretty big too.];W[dl]L[ek]C[reid: flying with a (e9) is  a bit better.]

(;W[hm]C[Cdude: A huge mistake. Must H11  now.

reid: not necessarily: if white wants to try to live
inside the moyo, then exchanging a (h11) for b (j10)
would make it that much more difficult.

the real problem here is that black is already way ahead
and white needs to do something drastic to get back in
the game.];B[hi];W[gh];B[hh];W[gn]C[reid: good timing.];B[fm];W[gg]L[fh]
C[reid:   perhaps white should consider the bamboo joint
at f12 instead here.  clearly it doesn't defend the
moyo as well, but if white just tries to fight the
battle of the moyos, he's going to lose anyway.  if
he makes a bamboo joint, then he can aim at attacking  black's h11 stones while reducing the black moyo.
in the current shape, black can always push and cut in
sente (g11, white f11, black g12), and then press white's
g13 stones to get his h11 stones out of trouble.];B[cn];W[bn];B[cr];W[bo]
L[fh][br]C[reid: ouch!  a bamboo joint at a (f12) instead
of g13 would have let white counter-hane at b
(b2) instead.];B[hg];W[gf];B[ie];W[hf]L[if]C[reid: there's a go prverb  that says "never
push into the knights move".  instead, you are
supposed to "cut across" it.  in this shape,
cutting across it means a play at a (j14) instead.

of course, playing at a (j14) doesn't work, but that
just means that white shouldn't play here at all.  the
black stone at j14 (after black responds) is much more
useful to black than the white stone at h14 is to white.];B[if];W[ij]C[reid:  if white wants to play here, he shouldn't
exchange h14 for j14 first.  just play here directly.];B[jg];W[ll];B[id]
;W[jc];B[le];W[md];B[hn];W[in];B[ho];W[kn];B[lp];W[nf];B[jj];W[nh]C[reid: white  doesn't really have time for this.
the center white group is too fragile.  it needs
immediate aid!];B[ph]L[lj]C[reid:  hmmm. looks to me like a black move  at a
(m10) instead would be devastating right now.];W[po]C[reid: white is really  too weak in the center
to be able to launch a new invasion like this.];B[qp]L[nn]C[reid: this lets white off the hook and makes q5
into a good move.  instead, black should seperate
white with a move like a (o6).];W[oq]L[mn][nn]C[reid: linking up with a (n6) or b  (o6) is better.]
;B[pp]C[reid: black is much too easily  satisfied :-)  again,
seperating the white stones is important.  black's corner
cannot die, so no need to play there now.];W[op];B[oo];W[no];B[on];W[mp]
;B[lo];W[lq];B[kq];W[nn];B[om];W[ln]C[reid: white is too lucky with this sequence  :-).
black has forced him to link up.];B[nm];W[mm];B[ge];W[ef];B[fe]
(;W[ff]L[ee]C[reid:  bad shape.  white a (e15) seems a bit
better - see variation.];B[ee];W[de];B[jl];W[ik];B[jk];W[jm];B[ii];W[im]
;B[lj];W[ki]L[li]C[reid: this seems to be an overplay.  black
could capture it with a (m11).];B[ji];W[mj];B[lk];W[mk];B[nl];W[kh]C[reid:  why didn't white connect?  perhaps he
thinks he can kill this black center group?];B[ml];W[kl];B[mq];W[ko];B[lr]

;W[lg]C[Cdude: Should be M14

reid: yes, m14 would be much better.  but still
not enough to win.

black just got too far ahead in the fuseki, and
white never really had a chance to get back in
the game...];B[lf];W[ke];B[mg];W[lh];B[mf];W[mh];B[ng];W[og];B[of];W[ld]
