AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[J: hi, notomi. You played much better the second half of the game. Just a few suggestions:

- play a little bit more on the safe side when playing with so much handicap
- when in trouble, relax, think and choose! usually you cannot have it all, so choose what you want to save and want can be sacrified

Anyway, if you played the beginning as good as the middle/end game, you'd probably won.

cheers,

jaime];W[nq];B[jp];W[qn];B[oo]C[j: good, escaping and splitting]
;W[qq];B[mo]C[Is this area overcrowded? I'm thinking maybe I should have played this stone at K16?

J: Maybe a little bit overcrowded, but... K16 would be great. Your group is not in danger of being isolated, so I'd ask the purpose of N5 instead of getting worried about overcrowding..
R4 (or q3) would be a good, more aggresive answer, maintaining the splitting action

Anyway, K16 is very good.];W[fc];B[jc];W[fe];B[dg];W[db];B[cc]
;W[id];B[jd];W[if];B[md]C[This seems to be too close to my own wall - how about L14??

J: I like this N16; L14 is more ambitious, but leaves a too wide open zone...]
;W[cn];B[dn]C[j: this move I don't like very much. How about a calmer f3? Looking for trouble with white on big handi games is starting problems...]
;W[dm];B[cm]C[J: this is the move I won't do, unless you have a very clear follow up... how about e6?]
;W[co];B[em]C[Maybe this just strengthens the white stone at D7 - should I have made defensive move  - say D5?

J: No, this is ok, you can D5 after white escapes... if he does]
;W[dl];B[el]C[j: You ran into problems here, now white can D5...]
;W[do];B[eo]C[I played this so I can save my stone at D4 - but thinking back this is not the best way ...

J: in this kind of situations, slow down, relax and think what's important for you to save... you must choose, you cannot keep it all]
;W[en];B[fn];W[ep];B[dn];W[eq];B[en];W[cl]C[j: sadly, white got the best part...]
;B[fg]C[j: why? You're not in danger; you're not putting white in danger, and this move promises not too much territory... why not r4, q13...?]
;W[ef];B[df];W[eg];B[eh]C[Maybe it's not time to play contact move just yet - maybe I should have played something like D12?

j: humm... I like this move; In my opinion, the problem is a few moves from now... keep looking]
;W[dh];B[ff]C[j: ok..., maybe E15 better, but ok anyway...]
;W[ee];B[ch]C[Should I have played F12 here?

j: i think it's ok, the problem is your next move];W[fh];B[gh]
C[j: HERE! Why don't you just play d11??? the difference is great! Don't try to save everything or you'll lose almost everything!]
;W[ei];B[fi];W[eh];B[hg];W[de];B[ce];W[ci];B[bh];W[cj];B[ej]
;W[di];B[gj]C[j: he's split you, you have two weaks groups (at least from white's point of view) and he's joined his...]
;W[je];B[ke]C[Again, a contact move which probably isn't good - I don't know .. maybe something like K12?

j: I like this move, it helps secure territory for you on the upper side. Just don't forget it, and give every move a meaning]
;W[kf];B[le];W[jh];B[jj];W[cb];B[bb];W[ba];B[ab];W[bi];B[ai]
C[This should have been used to protect cutting points at C13 & C14 - how about B13?

j: maybe b13 is fine, i'd prefer b14 and keep and eye on a12 to avoid a double atari]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[bg];B[ah];W[aj];B[bf];W[ag];B[af];W[bd];B[ql]
C[If I played this stone at A16, maybe I could have saved the group on top right??

j: this is always hard to say, but I bet you can't save it... r8 is good]
;W[qp];B[pn]C[I think I played this to connect the stones on the bottom with the ones on the right, but the shape seems to be defective ..

j: maybe not too beautiful, but I believe it works.];W[qm];B[pm]
;W[rl];B[qk]C[j: ok, so far so good];W[pq];B[op]C[Empty triangle - I played this so I can play P3 next without going gote but probably this was best played somewhere like Q13?

j: possible  moves now are q13, even r13, ... planning to play n13 or m14 next]
;W[qc];B[qd]C[j: you choose this direction, ok, but then don't forget to use the wall you're building]
;W[pc];B[oc];W[ob];B[nb]C[j: you're looking for trouble now. How about just o17, then w o18, then you n18?]
;W[rd];B[re];W[qe];B[qf]C[j: ag, too many cutting points... you could save the corner playing s17... now he'll destroy your group here...]
;W[od];B[pe];W[nc];B[oe]C[j: good!];W[mc];B[nd];W[oc];B[lc]
;W[lb];B[kb];W[mb];B[mh]C[j: good, very good!];W[kj];B[ki];W[ji]

;B[go];W[gp];B[iq];W[kh];B[lf]C[Probably this was better played at M13?

j: yes,sure, he's setup a snap-back for you, but this sequence is quite good up to now, I see you trying to isolate his center group... just make sure your center-left group lives!]
