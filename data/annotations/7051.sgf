C[fantomas27 [1d\]: hi gg

FM: hello, I am Martin and my comments will begin with "FM:" as my nick is Field Mouse.

Dear reviewer,
I played black in this game.
I think I played well in the beginning but then a mistake made me fall behind. Can you help me to find these mistakes ?

Thank you very much

(;B[pk];W[po];B[qp]LB[nc:A][pf:B][np:C]C[FM: although I am not a fan of these territorial moves, it looks like a good choice here. Without the classical A-B combination the usual sequence starting with black C would make the upper right black position too opened.]

;W[em];B[cn];W[co];B[en];W[do]
(;B[bn]TR[ne][oq]SQ[jf][hl][jl][nq]C[FM: when making life, black usually wants white to play this move so that black can make some ko, but the game is decided anyway.

This was quite nice fighting game with two fights in the right part of the board. In each of them you were doing well but then a weaker moment came, like the triangled move in the lower right corner or the one in the upper left, which allowed white to catch his breatch and shift in the fighting force and sneak out of the bad position. That is the usual disadvantage of fighting - one suboptimal move and the opponent is back in the game.
 There were also some moves, that were not optimal in the words of shape (squared ones) - although they seemed ok for the first look, they could be played a bit better and would make your fighting positions stronger.

I hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for any feedback to make my future work better!
