AB[pd][dp]C[colladay [4k\]: hi
sanlang800 [2k\]: hi

colladay: I played black in this game and white got a huge area on the left that was safe that I couldn't ever reduce.  This seems to happen a lot in my games.  Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance for the review!

I wrote this review twice, the first time when I was just looking through, and the second time after I found the reason fo your loss.  I will mark each of my comments from the second time through with a little 2:, so you can tell. I reccomend looking at the initial comments first, then the comment at the end, and then the second pass through.]
;W[pp]C[2: Your style of play is too passive. You are afraid of one of your groups dying.  While you are trying to save your group, your opponent keeps pushing you, and you keep letting him.  My advice for you is to resist as much as possible. (you will find that this will probably make you lose a lot because you are not used to it, and this kind of strategy does not work, but if you do this, wou will be able to recognize when it is good to resist and when it is not).  Remember, that Go is not about living, but having points.  Even professional players die sometimes.  Of course they know about the risk, but they knew that they could not win the game without risking death.  A loss is a loss no matter what; it could be by 50 or .5.  but if you know you will lose by .5, but if you risk this group to get one more point, and you manage to live; you will win.  If you die, you still lose.  Fight for the chance to win rather than just let your opponent win. And if your opponent asks for too many points, don't be afraid to say no.]
;B[dc];W[de];B[dh];W[fe];B[fc];W[cc];B[cb];W[dd]C[colladay: I didn't know how to respond to this, it is not a joseki that I know...

This is not joseki.];B[ec];W[bb]C[2: This is a great example.  When white played b18, he was asking: can I just take all the points in the corner and live easily?]
(;B[db]C[2: You said yes.];W[bd]C[However this leaves white with good shape and eyespace.

2: And so he did.]
(;B[cn]C[colladay: This felt slow, but I couldn't think of a better move...

The biggest move on the board would either be the bottom side or the right side (they are the same size), but in this situation you could consider protecting the your D12 stone.

This one doesn't take either big side, nor does it really defend the d12 stone well.]
;W[cl]C[This is actually a big overplay.

2: Here, white is asking: Can I take this big territory including capturing the d12 stone?]
(;B[ic]C[colladay: I thought an approach from right would attack my group strongly

I really don't think that your group was in any real danger of dying, but I do see your point. I think this is a good move, because the five stones are already heavy, so protecting them will ease your burden a little bit.]
;W[ei]C[I think ignoring this move may be too much; black might be able to kill your stone outright with just one more move.  You would get to tenuki, but it won't be big enough to cover the territory that white will make on the side, and the fact that you won't be able to attack the c8 stone anymore.

2: This way, you say yes you can have it.]
(;B[nq];W[ek]C[colladay: White used two moves to capture d12, thought I was doing ok at this point, is this wrong?

White didn't capture d12 yet, but you gave c8 a very easy life.  I think there was value in attacking that stone and neutralizing white's wall.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[mp];W[no];B[oq];W[pq];B[op];W[oo];B[po]C[White messed up here; you punished him correctly.]
;W[qo]
(;B[mq];W[qn];B[pm];W[qm];B[pl];W[mn]C[This exchange is good for black.]
(;B[pr]C[This actually relieves white of that ko.];W[qr];B[or]
;W[rq]
(;B[jp];W[ep]C[2: White is asking if he can ruin your bottom territory.]
(;B[cq]C[2: This way just says: ok take it.];W[do];B[co];W[dq]
;B[cp];W[eo];B[eq];W[fq];B[er];W[fr];B[dr]
(;W[iq]C[This is good for white, but he didn't play the strongest punishment.]
;B[jq];W[ip];B[io];W[kn];B[ir];W[hr];B[ko];W[jr]C[2: Your attack failed because you were scared of the cut at k5, so you gave up j2, which is a stone that is vital for the attack.]
;B[kr];W[is];B[ml]C[colladay: My attack on this group fizzled to nothing...

That group was basically alive anyway; attacking it would be hard.  However this attack is a much more worthwile endeavor.]

;W[jh];B[if];W[ii]LB[he:A][hh:B]C[2: This is the final example.  When white plays here. You need to remember that you are behind, so you need to take as many points as possible.  If you just live at A, you will not have enough points, and you will lose.  But if you play at B, you might be able to take more points and still love.  This way you win.  Worse case scenario  is that he kills you completely in his territory and you lose by far more than you would have before.  But how different is a loss by 50 and a loss by 35?]

;W[kg]C[colladay: At this point my moyo dissapears and I am way behind, so I have no more comments.

I actually count that this game is close, and you are leading slightly.]

C[I see your problem.  This would explain why you are often in stuations where you fail to reduce large moyos, allow them to happen, and lose a lot even though you did not die anywhere.  I have not seen any more of your games, but from this game, I can tell that you are afraid.  You are afraid of dying particularly (and afraid of complexity because that may lead to dying). I will go through the game again and point out some of these instances for reference.]
