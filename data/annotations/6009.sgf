C[Benoit03 [12k\]: hello
Matini [10k\]: hi have fun
Benoit03 [12k\]: enjoy

DC:
Hello, I've commented on most parts of the game. Your main problem seems to be how to attack, which I addressed in the game itself. Other than that I recommend:

* Working on your reading - Strong reading helps in any part of the game, and enables the player to attack better.
* Paying more attention in the endgame - if black in the game played more sente moves, and noticed some tesujis, is is likely he would have won.
* Asking yourself in any time of the game: Do I have to respond to this? Sente is big and not only in the endgame. We often respond to the opponent without even thinking about it.

Your game is not below average in any of the above three points (the opposite actually), but all three points give immediate benefits and are needed in any level.]
;B[cp];W[pd];B[pq];W[dc];B[eq]C[DC: Enclosing the other corner first is more usual. This enclosure will be most effective if it has a black stone at C10. If black played E3 at R5, the big side will be the bottom which is already controlled by C4. This way the big side is the left where white D17 prevents black from getting it all.]
;W[cf]C[DC: It is not recommended to let your opponent have two enclosures.]
;B[qo];W[jd];B[qf];W[qh]C[DC: This pincer is difficult for white because of the strong R5 stone.]
;B[of];W[oh]C[DC: This is also a mistake, white must play O16. Letting black surround the corner ruins the whole top side for white and the P12 move doesn't help white globally.]
;B[nd];W[oc];B[nc];W[qc];B[ob];W[pb];B[od];W[pc];B[nb];W[re]

(;B[qe];W[rd]C[DC: Here white is safe, black can still be cut, and white can play s14 to create connection. (See variation)]
;B[kc];W[ql];B[kp];W[jc]C[DC: This is big. If black plays there instead there is a major territorial difference and black will not have any trouble living.]
;B[kb];W[hc];B[dj];W[cn];B[dm]C[DC: This is not a great attacking move. There is a proverb: "Attack from afar", or "Don't touch weak stones" which applies here. Contact fighting causes the weak stone to reinforce itself while threatening the opponent's stones. A better attacking strategy here will be C8, followed by white E6.]
;W[cm];B[dl];W[ck];B[cl];W[bl];B[cj];W[bk];B[dk];W[bj];B[dn]
;W[bo];B[co];W[an]C[DC: White should not play here, B4 is better, but tenuki is best. It is not easy for black to kill because white C14 and B10 cannot be separated very easily. White O8 makes a major influence change, strengthening the group most effected by black's wall and making any territory gained in the centre smaller.]
;B[bp]C[DC: The corner is small, and even if black B11 would actually cut white, white will still live. Black has much bigger things to do. A move around the centre of the board or at O8 is big.]
;W[bm]C[Matini [10k\]: i guess i could resign already, that wall of yours is just too big

DC: No need for this, if white must defend, doing so by securing connection to c14 is more effective. (And of course white should simply tenuki)]
;B[ol];W[pk];B[ok];W[gq]
(;B[hp]C[DC: Same comment as D7. Shoulder-hitting this stone is not the best way to attack it. To attack a weak stone, concentrate on minimizing eye space and ruining shape. (See variation)]
;W[gp];B[ho];W[hq];B[iq];W[ir]
(;B[jr]C[DC: Make sure the double hane works before playing it. Here black gave white a free eye. (See variation)]

;W[pm];B[om];W[pj]C[DC: This is a good time to play around tengen.]
;B[oj];W[oi];B[mj]C[DC: Black can play closer to tengen.];W[jj]
C[DC: This move is indeed a problem for black but there is not much that can be done to kill or trap white because of K16 and P12. When the opponent invades your territory you must aim to get influence while attacking white, or possibly territory in other places. White has some defects in the top left corner(F17 and the weak large knight enclosure) which may be harmed pretty badly by this move.

You should go for the kill only if you can read it fully. The same goes for enclosing white or anything else too. Black can let white live easily and gain much.]
;B[jh]C[DC: This is a good attacking move. A contact move will not work here. Black K8, trying to save whatever's left of the middle is bad attitude, and white will just push around to make the territory even smaller before running away to K16 giving black nothing in return.

Every time your opponent invades you, try to think how you can harm him using the invasion. Don't try to be greedy, because usually the invasion cannot be killed and attempting to do so will ruin your position. (See variation)]

;B[kf];W[kg];B[jg];W[lf];B[mf];W[ke]C[DC: It is obvious white can't be surrounded so easily. Black must be able to let white connect to one side while making strength on the other.]

(;B[ia];W[jb];B[ja];W[ga];B[hb];W[gb];B[ka]C[DC: Black has sente moves to play, I'd leave this move for later. If white wants to capture a single stone in gote he is welcome. Not to mention black can play this move at J18 which is bigger and doesn't give sente to white.]

;B[lf]C[DC:

Differences between this position and the corresponding actual game position:
* Black has Thickness.
* Black can play some forcing moves against white's connection.
* Black's O17 group is strong and not likely to be requiring any more moves in this phase of the game.
* Black's K12 stone is safe so white will not be able to chase it while ruining black's area.
* Black can make a move at L9 or J8 that will make many points.
* The F15 area will not end up as white territory.
* Black can now invade at F17 without fear. If white fails to connect his groups H17 will most likely die. Even if white succeeds doing so, it is more than possible that the D17-C14 weakness will be exposed.

This variation is nothing special, the only thing about it is that black did not try too hard to hold white in, but instead concentrated on getting thickness in return.]

;B[fk];W[er];B[dr];W[fr];B[dq];W[hs];B[oj];W[pj];B[ki]C[DC: White lives but black gets a very big territory for practically nothing. Plus, the F5 cut is open. Compare this with the position at the same move in the actual game and see that here white has also been enclosed and black got sente after the invasion.]

(;B[iq];W[go]
(;B[hp];W[gp];B[hm]C[DC: This option immediately comes to mind. If black does his reading, which is not too hard, white will die.]
)
(;B[il]C[DC: This move makes it very very hard for white to break out which means he'll have to make eyes where he is. Because of J3 white can only make a single eye in gote. But either way, J8 helps black defend against any other white attack on his territory.]
)))
(;B[rf]C[DC: This move is full of uncertainty for white. It weakens R12 and prevents it's connection to S15, and now black Q15 becomes sente and white Q15 gote because of black's threat to kill.]

(;W[qk];B[pe];W[ck];B[rd]C[DC: White is now in an L shape, and therefore dead.
(See http://senseis.xmp.net/?LGroup)])
(;W[pe];B[pf];W[qk];B[rd]C[DC: White is dead so Q15 is gote. Of course black still has to make sure his groups are ok too.]
