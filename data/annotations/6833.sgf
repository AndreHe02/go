C[dingo [5k\]: hello
-----
P:Hi, this is my first post in GTL.
I looking for a review in my games, especially in opening.
At this game, white is behind in early part of the game, but somehow i managed kill the black stones, so i can win this game by luck.

I been reviewing this game before, and i very appricieted if u can show me some better variation for both size.

Hi, Im dN21death[2d\] on KGS. In this game, there were alot of fights which I thought was a bad idea for white to get into. B played tengen first which gives him the advantage in any fight ahead. It seemed you know the idea of overconcentration but you still becamse overconcentrated in this game.]
;B[jj]C[Ponaryo [4k\]: hi

Tengen is very special opening. You may want to find a way to make b's tengen stone not very useful. B will probably want to get into many fights to use his tengen stone.]
;W[pd];B[cd];W[pq];B[dq];W[qk];B[nc]LB[lc:C][pf:B][qf:A]C[A: Your move
B:I think works better with R9
C:A pincer might be nice to make positions on other sides other than the right.]

you may tenuki here or you can play
A or B.]

;B[qp]C[Still aji to live but I think b is better now.];W[fd]
;B[jc]C[You might even consider tenuki to play on top left or so.]

(;W[kd]C[B has two weak groups now this is good move.]
(;B[gc]LB[fc:B][jd:A]C[When black played here it was very good for w but you misplayed it.

B is very good for white.]

(;W[fe]C[i am not sure about this, because it has bad shape it isnt? (E16 stone look strange)

You have to consider the exchange as well, b's tengen stone is ruining your influence and b just got a big corner of solid territory.]
;B[ne]LB[ng:B][nh:A]C[The capping move at B looks better I think.]

(;W[nh];B[lf];W[jg]C[Well I didnt really get this attack you just pushed him into tengen stone but his stones were very cuttable so you still killed part of it.]

All your stones are in one area of the board. The only other two stones are very weak.]

Yes, b should of just connected xD.];W[qo];B[cn];W[iq]

;W[lq];B[pr];W[rq];B[op];W[rp];B[dg]C[now black lead in much point, so i need to invade him.

I thought the only weakness of black's territory is at around c10/c6 stones. But not sure how to make it.

B created kind of weak groups. Theres a cut at M11 very big. The P2 group can be attacked but not in a severe way.
You might want to probe B'scorner around C3. 
C5 might do something threaten to go into corner or move out.

I end my comments here, B played thinking he was winning I think making sacrifices here and there for what he thought was more solid play. You took advantage in some cases and got the lead by killing that group. It's not always just luck. :P Good luck in improving.]
