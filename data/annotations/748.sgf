C[By making this move, white is encouraging his opponent to lauch a splitting
attack by playing at say P5. This threatens to either reduce white's territoty
on the lower side, or seriously weaken the Q6 stone and hence strengthen black's
territorial claim there. White cannot defend against both threats.   For white in this position, O5 is much better - it is on the junction of
two moyos, it make the lower side potentially big while keeping the right
side smaller.];B[qn]C[Black should launch splitting attack here. Of course, the outcome of the
splitting attack is impossible to predict for black, since white has choices,
but black should put his faith in the stones!

In addition, this move is a contact move. Such moves should be resisted. In this  case black is strengthening white's stones and will probably now just end up with
the corner while white threatens a massive lower-side moyo.]
;W[qm];B[qo];W[pm];B[oq];W[or]C[Playing P2 looks small. Better would be O5, which has become huge.]
;B[np];W[mq]C[Black seems to be getting his splitting attack anyway. This was because white
played small moves. If white had plyed O5 earlier, he would have joined his
two weak groups and shut black in.];B[mp];W[lq];B[nj]C[Looks good. Attacks the right-side white stones while working well with the
Q16 stone.];W[nm];B[lp]C[N10 may be better.];W[kp];B[lm];W[ml]
C[White may or may not be able to hack his way out here. In any case,
black should pay attention that the moves he makes strengthen his own
stones. Playing net moves rather than contact moves here stands a much
better chance of capturing, and also works better with black's stones on
the top side.];B[ll];W[mk];B[mj];W[lk]C[Looks like Edinburgh go to me... :-)]

C[Always good to tenuki!];B[nd]C[The standard sequence from here leaves black with inefficient stones -  the wall which will form around O16 is too close to the O10 etc stones.
I would consider playing a pincer instead, say L17, M17 or M16.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[jc];B[me];W[ld];B[df]C[Interesting. Correct for black to try to help the F16 stone, otherwise white
threatens to make territory at the top.];W[ec];B[cj];W[ch];B[dh]
;W[cg]C[Time to do some counting. If black is ahead, then the simple connection on
D13 looks better than C14, the move played. In fact, black looks about 20 points
behind, so C14 is OK. F17 might be good. Also think about endgame moves....]

;B[dd];W[dc];B[ce];W[cc]C[Horrible! F17 would be much better. B5 is a good 15-point gote move for later.]

;B[ic];W[je]C[I see the point of this move, but K18 is better I think. Black now has a monkey-jump:
9 points sente - on the top edge, which is big.];B[lb]C[That jumped long (so possible monkey) but without losing height. A flying
squirrel jump? Don't often hear of those in go.... because they don't work.]

;B[ek]C[Black would in fact prefer to make some territory on the left side and so
play D9 instead of this move(D10). Now white will swarm all over black's
left side.];W[ck];B[dk];W[bk];B[bj]C[This move achieves nothing. Good moves for black here are:

Q18 - this is big and sente. I would play this now.
B6. This is small but probably sente.
G5 - threatens to make some territory in the middle. I think black should at least  try to do this. He may win.]
;W[bi];B[jf]C[Looking forward to end of game, note that white now starts to build his H13 etc
stones into what becomes a giant dead group......];W[jg];B[kf]
;W[ji];B[kg]C[White can now play L10. Better than this black move would be for black to
play L10 instead and make white sweat a bit.];W[ii];B[kj]C[Aha!]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[lh];B[jh]C[Why? J9 stops white running into the centre, and make the centre moyo look
good.];W[ih];B[lf];W[kh];B[ij];W[oh];B[nh];W[ng];B[mh];W[mg]
