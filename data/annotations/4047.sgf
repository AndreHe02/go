C[Hi,

Hyde n sk :

FIrst of all, i would like to thank the reviewer who review our game so much for spending time to do this review.  This is a long game, 3 hours game.

Hyde : In this game, i dont play my usual style.  im trying to learn to keep sente and attack, and meanwhile gain from her running. but i fail.. i guess.
i try to keep sente and ignore sk's move. Pls comment on my wrong tenuki, and how i could better keep sente and gain from attack.

sk : pls comment on my mistake and how i could do better.




To White:  You certainly need to look more carefully at when to tenuki.  Instead of making 3 weak black groups at the cost of having 4 weak white groups, it's better to make one weak black group at one time and focus on it to make one strong white group and one weak (but alive) white group.  Once you master that, you can have two weak black groups at the same time that you chase.  Also keep an eye out for attacking moves that also make territory.  You tried to do this, but it was too easy for black to pincer and erase that territory.

To Black:  You took advantage of White's mistakes well.  There were some mistakes, but it wasn't enough to lose.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dq];B[dn]C[sk : i just wanna see how hyde reply this move. btw, is there a joseki of this ?

There is a joseki of this, but I don't know it.  I do not have my Joseki dictionary with me here.]
;W[fp]C[hyde : not sure of how to reply, i play f4, aiming at bottom territory... and later attack the d6 stone.

This is probably an ok move];B[cp];W[cq]C[hyde : i think this is a good move :)     is it?

It's a good move, but not a great move.  If you were eager to tenuki, this would have been a good opportunity.  Also usually players will leave the exact control of a corner to later in situations like this.  Instead you could play J3 or K3.]
;B[hq]C[sk : trying to steal eye shape, weaken the white group and strengthen right side, making some bottom territory.]
;W[bp]C[Hyde : nothing much.. just trying to keep sente, is it sente?

This early in the game very little is absolutely sente.];B[co]
;W[cl]C[hyde : trying to steal base. and keep sente.];B[cm]
;W[dl]C[getting territory on left while attacking black group.]
;B[fn];W[hp]C[not sure what this move accomplish, but i know... a black move at there... is bad for me.
anyway, is this a good move?

This is an ok move.  G5 might be better.];B[ip];W[ho];B[gq]
;W[fo];B[fm]
(;W[kq]C[Now you are biting off more than you can chew.  See variation.]
;B[jq];W[kp];B[io];W[nq]C[hyde : attack while gaining.... attacking q4
is htis coorect tho?];B[mp];W[mq]
(;B[df]C[sk : trying to lessen his left side territory. and attack
pls comment on this move.

hyde : i think this is not a good move of black, because it invites pincer tat strengthen... d8 stone, somehow i felt that this is in favour of me, is it?

It indeed does strengthen as you say.  If black attacked the two stones below, then white would have been forced to defend, and then black could have next attacked above.  See variations.]
;W[ch];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce]
(;W[bc]C[hyde : eye n base stealing. same time attack the black group at d15, and gaining upper territory.


Here I would probably play G17 instead.  Your move is ok, but you have so many weak groups already on the board.  You can sacrifice the corner sometimes for a long side.]
;B[ed];W[ec];B[de];W[dc]C[hyde : is this necessary? i am just thinking that .... not to leave aji.... maybe it's unnessary.... i should just e12?

It is dangerous to not connect unless you think you can win the ko.]
;B[dj]C[sk : trying to attack d8 stone... and getting outer influence.]
;W[bo]C[hyde : dont know why here...      felt that i made mistake...?
     where should i move?

This is definitely not the time to tenuki.  Urgent moves before big moves.  Defending the side group is the most urgent business at the moment.]
;B[bn];W[fq]C[hyde : trying to prevent any more eye of black.. im thinking that black will try to separate my stones at d8 and c12... then i'll be running.... as two different group, c12, and d8,   while counter attack...the upper group and trade d8 for j4 group. so i left the left side open

so... this move is a preparation for my run. and waiting for black to c10, separate my stone]
;B[bl]C[Hyde: as white,  i didnt expect this move .... coming... now black alrady has two eye for her d6 group.....   and my attack plan fails. i think this is a good move, better than c10.

so... all the plan is in vain, now i'll try to live....  that's wat in my mind at the moment.]
;W[cj];B[ck];W[bk];B[dk];W[bj];B[eh]C[sk : trying to seal white in.]
;W[fd]C[hyde : i know that my c10 in danger, but i don wanna live there. that time i tot getting the fourthline is bigger....

definitely living there is bigger. since fourth line with 1 stone, doesn't secure it.. :p
wat was i thinking?

Exactly.  If a group can live it's generally worth a lot of points, and you have to get a lot of secured territory in exchange if it is to be worth it.]
;B[bg];W[od]C[hyde : trying to complete what i've started at f16, to get fourth line land.]
;B[md];W[qn];B[pn];W[pm];B[po];W[qm]C[This move is not bad in many circumstances, but in this case I would probably have played R8 or R9 (even R10 maybe)]
;B[pj]C[sk : preventing white territory, and supporting the upper two stones]
;W[kc];B[hd];W[ke];B[mf];W[nm]C[From this point on, the moves start making less and less sense.  Right now black is winning, so white should have a plan on how to invade.  Instead, white's moves seem somewhat random and nonsensical.  I would recommend focusing a little more on either the top or the bottom.  You can tenuki and go back and forth, but I didn't think the times you chose to do that were the right times.]
;B[mn];W[qg];B[oe];W[in]C[This is definitely the wrong move.  Keeping the J4 group seperate from the N4 group is very important.]

;B[qe];W[on];B[oo];W[om];B[np];W[oq];B[ph];W[rd];B[qc];W[op]
;B[mo];W[kn]C[hyde : maybe im too hasty here...too agresive..a bad move here i guess.... better to secure...

I really don't see that black group dying.  your invasion in the upper corner is much more important and i don't see why you teunki away from it so often, especially if black can ignore the move you made and resecure the corner]
