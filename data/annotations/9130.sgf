C[foeZ [-\]: thank you very much for teaching me
foeZ [-\]: let me stretch my back quickly, it's so hurting

Hi Slarly and foeZ.

Firstly a bit of a caveat, I have only recently started playing again after a two year break, so I am a bit rusty.  Please take anything I say with caution.]
;B[qd]C[Slarty [1d\]: eh, have a nice game];W[dc];B[pp];W[dq]
;B[oc]C[--
I personally prefer to break up the left side here because I find that as black it leads to a simpler game.  I do not think your move is a mistake, it just gives white the opportunity to build a big framework and I find it hard to play as black against that.]
;W[qn]C[--
I would have played more like R10 as white - this move seems to ask for a loose pincer which is then a perfect extension]
;B[ql]C[--
I think this is fine but I personally would have played a looser pincer - probably Q9.]
;W[on];B[nq];W[pk]
(;B[pl];W[ol];B[qk];W[pj];B[qj];W[pi];B[qh]C[Slarty [1d\]: to use that thing
--
I think this is a good choice for black.]
(;W[om]C[foeZ [-\]: im a single digit kyu by the way
foeZ [-\]: i hope i can somewhat be a challenge still
Slarty [1d\]: always
foeZ [-\]: white can still make a ko in the corner, right?
foeZ [-\]: ok im ready
--
This move by white is very slow, I think it gives black the opportunity to take the lead.

Yes black can cut at P7 without it but the cut is very minor as R3 is still open.  

This move gives white nice thickness so I would be choosing between gently reducing that and collecting points and challenging white to think of a way ofcatching up.

For instance you could K16, Q12, K4, C10...];B[ce]C[Slarty [1d\]: yeah that's still gotta be there
foeZ [-\]: it's too slow right now though
foeZ [-\]: later black can r5 and fix that
Slarty [1d\]: with r6 it probably just lives
foeZ [-\]: ok
foeZ [-\]: r3 r4 s4 s5 s2 r5 q3 q2 something like this?
foeZ [-\]: you should have taken sente there
foeZ [-\]: black got ahead here
Slarty [1d\]: ehhh]
(;W[ci]C[foeZ [-\]: i think p7 was a bit slow
foeZ [-\]: by the way
Slarty [1d\]: ok
Slarty [1d\]: that would be great
--
I'm not very familiar with the joseki which follow from this white move.  I would probably play F15 because I'm vaguely concerned as black about the thickness developing in the centre]
;B[cc]C[--

I don't really like this choice.  You get a settled group in sente but white gets nice influence in both directions.  I guess it depends what you're going to use sente for]
;W[cb];B[dd];W[ec];B[bc]C[foeZ [-\]: because white has nothing to develop at the top
Slarty [1d\]: it's unclear]
(;W[gd]C[shipburner [7k\]: although i see and play the seq in upper left myself, i believe its not joseki and here appears not so good for B
foeZ [-\]: g16 is for when there is something to develop
foeZ [-\]: like a white stone nearby
Slarty [1d\]: I was planning on playing the next move on the top
foeZ [-\]: there's no time
foeZ [-\]: but the principle is still correct
--
I would have played G16 at H17 personally];B[do]C[shipburner [7k\]: the d16 move i think is the deviation ?
Slarty [1d\]: mm nope, check kogos
shipburner [7k\]: ok
Piem [1k\]: but black should play b18?
foeZ [-\]: top left is miai
foeZ [-\]: if white b18 b c13
foeZ [-\]: which is bad for white
foeZ [-\]: cos it's gote
foeZ [-\]: and small
foeZ [-\]: if w c13, b play b18
foeZ [-\]: and that's also small for white
foeZ [-\]: because it's a 1 space extension
Piem [1k\]: true, but so it is for b
foeZ [-\]: the top left is settled for now
foeZ [-\]: there is nothing to gain or lose there right now for both black and white until the game further develops
foeZ [-\]: if b play b18, white will just play a big move somewhere else
foeZ [-\]: it's super gote
foeZ [-\]: :p
foeZ [-\]: so far, i'm fairly pleased with my fuseki
Piem [1k\]: hm
Piem [1k\]: i see you guys are playing right now
foeZ [-\]: yes
foeZ [-\]: it's a teaching game, slarty is teaching me
Piem [1k\]: i'm sorry i interrupted :)
foeZ [-\]: it's ok
foeZ [-\]: we all learn from questions
shipburner [7k\]: excuse me too
foeZ [-\]: better to settle fast than to leave a hole
foeZ [-\]: in the end, i didn't capitalize on it
--
I'm not quite convinced by this move.  White will pincer and so settle C11.  Then you will jump and white will settle D3.  I guess it's ok, but I would be more interested in J17 and K4 personally]

(;W[cm]C[foeZ [-\]: no problem
foeZ [-\]: there is no points, no influence, no base
Slarty [1d\]: it would be a different game]
(;B[en]C[foeZ [-\]: i think g16 should be at h17
Slarty [1d\]: yes, e6 is nowadays considered odd, I believe
foeZ [-\]: i think it works well here
foeZ [-\]: it separates white
foeZ [-\]: so black can use that to make eyes/attack
foeZ [-\]: theres a weakness at c9 still
foeZ [-\]: white will have to defend that
foeZ [-\]: and he will become overconcentrated
foeZ [-\]: and there will still be aji
Slarty [1d\]: how do you know that :p
--
I would have played the jump.  To me this move is for when keeping C7 isolated is important but here white has C11 so the isolation is less interesting.]

(;W[cp]C[--
This move seems very slow by white, I would be seriously tempted as black to take the lower side and permit white to connect.]
;B[co];W[fq]C[foeZ [-\]: i as black wouldn't feel very comfortable in this position]

(;B[dl]C[foeZ [-\]: this is why i like getting lessons from dan players, they're so good :D]
;W[ck]C[foeZ [-\]: kyu teachers usually mess up
Slarty [1d\]: let's compare
foeZ [-\]: i think white is better off in this scenario
Slarty [1d\]: white has more territory and black still needs to live
foeZ [-\]: yeah you're right];B[gp]C[Slarty [1d\]: <big time messing up in store>
foeZ [-\]: what do you mean? i'm sorry i don't quite follow
Slarty [1d\]: you underestimate how weak 3d is
foeZ [-\]: haha, im sorry but im not quite strong enough to underestimate them
foeZ [-\]: my friend says that i'm probably between 5kyu and 3kyu
foeZ [-\]: there's too much for black to keep in mind i think]
;W[gq]C[foeZ [-\]: i've been reading books and watching lectures from high dan players to improve my direction of play while doing life & death problems to improve my reading, it's rough
foeZ [-\]: i really wanna become 1dan
Slarty [1d\]: try watching games e.g. on tygem sometime, if you feel a plateau]
;B[hp]
(;W[fo]C[Slarty [1d\]: better plan than extending on the top
--
F5 feels much too crude to me.  Black has the c8 push, B8, D4... and D8 really helsp too.]

(;B[dp];W[bp]C[--
I don't like this at all with the E4 weakness.]
(;B[fp];W[eq];B[hq]C[--
I guess this result is ok for you but I think you missed an opportunity.]
;W[ep];B[eo];W[gn]C[Slarty [1d\]: this cut is a much more serious thing to keep in mind

--
The cut is a problem but it isn't an urgent concern, I think white activated it too early.]

(;B[fl];W[hm];B[gk]C[--
This move feels very slow to me - I would prefer F10 locally but you can jump further]
;W[hk]C[Slarty [1d\]: ok...so like I said, there were no big mistakes
foeZ [-\]: subtle mistakes
Slarty [1d\]: most of what I noticed was play forcing moves a little rashly
foeZ [-\]: impatience :p
foeZ [-\]: i wouldn't want white to start poking at my shape to be honest
Slarty [1d\]: ah...the mirror argument
foeZ [-\]: g8 is pretty big for white
foeZ [-\]: by playing those forcing moves, i fix g8 in sente
foeZ [-\]: letting white push up makes the wall on the right very effecient
OtterGo [6k\]: Black C8 good?
foeZ [-\]: c8 is too soon to play
foeZ [-\]: black must first run out, then make eyes]
(;B[fn];W[go];B[gm];W[hn]LB[gm:3][fn:1][hn:4][go:2]C[foeZ [-\]: i wanted to ruin your shape while fixing mine
foeZ [-\]: and getting points
foeZ [-\]: black is practically alive there now
Slarty [1d\]: yes, but in reality you can't get extra stones for free
Slarty [1d\]: white got thick
foeZ [-\]: thats true
Slarty [1d\]: was there any need?
foeZ [-\]: if white surrounds black, he will have a huge advantage
Slarty [1d\]: c8 is inefficient after this sequence];B[jo];W[hl]
;B[gj];W[bb];B[cg]C[foeZ [-\]: e10
foeZ [-\]: yes, black should e10 here
--
E10? I would have played where you played]
(;W[ei]C[foeZ [-\]: e9 can be cut
foeZ [-\]: and will give black an eye
Slarty [1d\]: so, e11 here is flexible, hence interesting]
(;B[dj]C[foeZ [-\]: it's interesting, but a bit odd shape
foeZ [-\]: i messed up there
foeZ [-\]: thanks for showing me a better move, you're right
Slarty [1d\]: that doesn't mean your way was wrong. however, it's a one way street
--
It's handy for black that white has this weakness but I think it's too early to activate it]
;W[di]C[foeZ [-\]: e11 was a bit too much i think
foeZ [-\]: there is a better shape there i believe];B[cl];W[bl]

(;B[cj]C[--
This feels like ajikeshi.];W[bj]C[foeZ [-\]: n3 isn't devastating unless black gets cut]
;B[dk];W[bh];B[hj];W[lo]C[foeZ [-\]: the capture wasn't necessary
--
Agreed]
(;B[kp];W[jn]C[foeZ [-\]: instead of b9

C[foeZ [-\]: for b];B[ef]C[foeZ [-\]: this was bad for black

Ok, overall I think you played pretty well.  I got the feeling that white was playing a teaching game and experimenting with things and you didn't fall for any of the traps.  

There were a few moves I commented during the game as being suboptimal but nothing huge.  Most of it was not taking opportunities to punish white more.

Sorry I haven't really reviewed from white's side - I felt white was testing you which makes it very hard to review.  Where white has made a move I really disagreed with I commented at the time.]
