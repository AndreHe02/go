(;FF[4]GM[1]SZ[19]AP[SGFC:1.12]C[NM: In this game I (playing W) made secure
territory in three corners, but my
opponent made a huge moyo which I
didn't manage to break into.
I would like to know where my strategic
errors were: should I have stopped him
from making the moyo, and if so how,
or should I haev been able to break
into the moyo?  During the game I
thought I could break in, but failed.

After move 160 the game was effectively settled, and I'm not particularly looking for any comments
from then on (though all comments are
welcome).]US[Brought to you by IGS]GN[Niall-Huk(B) IGS]RE[B+Resign]PW[Niall]

not that I know, but B still seemed
to come out with a globally good

but I wonder whether I should have
taken say C6 first.

E: the sensitive location now is top center and right, since this is where B can widen his
position. making a shimari is solid but questionable, as k16 now is too good for B.
around c6 is relatively small since the bottom is more easily reducible.
I'd go for k16 or o17 for W instead of d17.]WL[709];B[cj]C[B plays in the wrong direction. k16 is screaming with frustration.]
BL[713];W[fq]C[shows why c10 is not good enough, but too early. k16/o17 are still nore urgent.]
WL[702];B[hq]C[NM: Here I thought of answering F5,
but after B D6, W H5, B M5, he has
two large safe territories and I have a
weak group between them - I didn't
like the prospect.

;W[bq]WL[677];B[fp]BL[685];W[fr]WL[672];B[bp]C[M: I thought I could still survive the
attack at B2, and didn't want to defend
in gote.
E: sure you can. your corner is safe territory. B b4 is too early.
but look carefully : you have played along with B's scheme for center emphasis, and you have taken
solid territory. moreover, you made some bad exchanges - too little territory for the influence you gave. and your opp srones are ALL working together perfectly, while yours have no connection whatsoever. for the near future, you have to play carefully, reducing lightly, trying to take some center
positions and weather out this bad situation.]BL[674];W[kd]C[good  area, but too far.]
WL[532];B[id]C[exactly what B should do when W overextends under unfavorable conditions.]
BL[668];W[nc]WL[523];B[nd]BL[660];W[oc]C[good.]WL[456];B[pc]C[B contradicts himself. o16 aims at widening the right moyo, but when W goes for the corner,
B defends it instead of playing the consistent move of p16.]BL[653];W[od]
WL[328];B[pe]BL[624];W[oe]C[pushing your opp on the fifth line is generally bad , but here it reduces his moyo.  however, there is a feeling that W must try something more drastic to have a chance here.

BL[614];W[gd]C[NM: Was this the right point?  I wanted  to attack J16 in order to push into his
moyo.
yes, very good. W narrowed the gap; however, B solidified the lead he has left.]
WL[302];B[ie]C[overaggressive. W o17 is secure, so no point in seperating from g16.]
BL[606]
(;W[kf]C[very bad. instead of attacking j16 from the left for the little time it will take to reach friendly influence, you chase from your strong side. l14 doesn't help to reduce the right side, which is solid territory,
and your top right is alive without it. you payed dearly for it's life by letting B have p14-13; now it's time to use it !  see variation.]
WL[294];B[ge]C[good.]BL[576];W[gc]C[this does not enable connection. your judgement of o17 as weak group is destructive.
B gets to make j16 not only secure, but a constructive part of his moyo.]
WL[289];B[ng]BL[566];W[mf]WL[285];B[gh]C[the game is really over here.]
BL[556];W[ch]C[NM: While C12 got me nice territory,
it wasn't much of an attack on the J16
group - I wonder if I should have played  higher, say E12?
E: too late to attack j16... if to keep playing, play m11.]WL[271];B[ei]
BL[553];W[nj]C[NM: While this was quite deep, it didn't
seem to be to be easily attacked - but in
a sense it turned out not to be deep enough?
Was there another attack that would have been better?  Q8? K10?

E: too deep, but looks suitably desperate.]WL[258];B[lj]C[B played very well this game.]
BL[544];W[mn]WL[252];B[ol]BL[534];W[ml]WL[247];B[lm]C[very good judgement. B can cut o10 off, but this is small. instead he builds his left on a grand scale.
I don't think he'll stay 5k for long.]BL[528];W[mm]WL[238];B[lo]BL[525]
;W[mo]WL[234];B[ln]BL[521];W[ap]C[NM: Since I was sure this would be sente
now, I felt it was time to ensure the
life of the BL group, while eating
in a little to the moyo.
E: as I said, W corner is absolutely alive, with territory.
you must see here that B is hugely ahead. Sorry to say this, but I myself got some etiquette lessons
lately, and playing a4 in this position could actually be seen as bad manners.
To sum up :
 get better at seeing what is alive and what not ; it will pay off very quickly.
 make your stones work together: see how B's stones work beautifully while yours are seperated.
learn to recognize the right direction of play; kajiwara's book will do you wonders.
on a higher level, try to counter your opp strategy; don't play submissively.
if you combine your solid territorial play with these improvements, you will become much stronger.
Best wishes !

made the B L to be some 50 points,
