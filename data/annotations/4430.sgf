C[ichidas: hi

Black had a very good opening and made a huge moyo.  White invaded too deeply, but black didn't attack effectively.  Then black misplayed a ko, and overlooked a tactic, and the game became close.  It looks like black thought he was behind, and gave up many points the the endgame trying to catch up, to eventually lose.  Black still could have won in the endgame.]
;B[pd]C[This is my game played on IGS 23rd of June 2005];W[dq]
;B[cd];W[ec]C[This move is unusual.  The open corner is bigger.  Since this move is between two enemy stones, black has a good pincer and will likely end in sente to take the open corner himself.]
;B[gc];W[ee];B[df];W[pp]LB[dh:B][hd:A]C[White plays tenuki here, but the joseki is to continue at A or B.]

(;B[ef]LB[dc:A]C[I'm guessing that this is the correct way to play.

I would start with A to take away white's base.  You want white to push at E14 since that will give you 4th line territory on the left side.]
;W[fe]
(;B[ic]LB[kc:C][id:B][jc:A]C[I want to strengthen my weak group before developing my strong one.

I thought that if I extended to A, it might cause some problems later, such as bad aji, so I made a safe one point jump, making myself strong.

I don't like the idea of black making a knight's move to B because white can later play an approach move such as white C.

I like extending to A better, since it is the right distance from the stone the upper right.  The gap between move 11 and the stone at Q16 is too wide.]
;W[cb];B[cc]C[I thought this move was ok because white could not play down at B19 immediately because of the weakness. I read out the variation as shown:]

(;W[db];B[ff]C[Good.  This makes good use of your strength using the stone at J17.]
;W[he]LB[ge:A]C[I was expecting white to simply extend to A, but jumped to 16 instead]
;B[fd]LB[ed:B][ge:A]C[I don't know if black's move at 17 is a little unreasonable. It does look like bad shape. I'm not sure though. You can see my intensions with A and B]

(;W[ed]C[White can resist at g16.];B[ge];W[bc]
(;B[hf]C[I think this is and important point, although this allows white to make some kind of extension on the left side. I want to make sure my groups are connected, and try to create central influence.

You should block first at b16, since it is sente against the corner group, and big.  Then you can play here.  Your discovery after the game is correct.]
;W[bd];B[do]TR[bd]C[Now the marked stone makes it hard for you to make territory on the left edge.

Approaching here is big, but the right side is also very big, since it makes you a huge moyo.  You should find a ways to play on the right as soon as possible.]
;W[cj]LB[be:A]C[This felt painful for black as he is also open at the bottom on the left side at A]

(;B[cl]C[I would start by attacking the corner since white ignored your approach move.]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[bf];B[be];W[bg];B[ad];W[ac];B[ae];W[ba];B[cq]
;W[eq]C[This looks like an underplay by white.

bad move for white.  should be c2];B[cp]C[I feel reasonably happy with my position at this point]
;W[hq]C[Now is a good time to take the big point on the right side.  If white defends this group, you get two moves in a row on the right.]

(;B[ej]C[I'm not sure of the best way to attack white's weak group, but I tried to build more influence and take a center oriented approach.]
;W[dk];B[fl];W[dl];B[cm];W[em];B[fm];W[en]C[If you plan to let white link up, it is better to just make the knight's move.

You can also try leaning on the lower group first.]
(;B[eo]C[I don't like this move since you force white to push through a small gap in your wall.]
;W[fn];B[gn];W[fo];B[go];W[fp]C[This went as planned, but i feel that my next move was bad. The small amount of black influence I just created must be strong first]

(;B[qj]C[I'm sure this move was bad

I like this move, on the big open right side.];W[jc]C[This is strange, attaching to a strong group.]

(;B[ie]C[I prefer to play at J16 to more strongly attack the stone just played.]
;W[jd];B[nc]C[preventing a white extension to this point

I would go one point further to make it harder to make a base.]
;W[lc];B[kf]C[trying to build up the center whilst attacking white.]
;W[le]C[white tries to make some shape]
(;B[ke]C[I try to force white into bad shape];W[kd]
(;B[lf];W[me]C[This gives white a good shape, connected with potential eyes.]
;B[ng]C[calmly building up the center when white is still weak.

Good.  You need some moves toward the bottom to finish your center moyo tho.]
;W[ib]C[now white plays to make life]
(;B[id]C[Too easy.];W[hb];B[gb];W[jj]C[I thought 69 would be more threatening, but it looks like I mis-read.
white 70 is too painful.

White has plenty of eye space.  70 is too deep, so you should welcome it.  You still have much more potential territory, and you should easily solidify it while attacking 70.]

(;B[kb];W[lb];B[mb];W[ka];B[ja];W[la];B[md];W[mc];B[nb];W[jb]
;B[nd];W[ld]C[Good.  solidify the upper right first.];B[jl]
;W[mj]
(;B[kj]C[This is not good.  White is making a light group and is willing to sacrifice one stone here.  You need to find a way to make these stones heavy and connected, so you can attack them as a unit.]
;W[kk]C[I read out that I could cut and attack white, but my attack kind of failed, and later found myself behind.

I'm wondering where I went wrong

You can play at m9 to take the center, but it makes white thick in the center, so it's not so good.

I like m10 since it either takes the right side or the center.]

(;B[jk]C[Once you play here, white gets to sacrifice a stone and make a nice shape, so this move is wrong.]
;W[ki];B[lj];W[li];B[lk];W[mk];B[ll];W[mh]C[Nice sequence by white.]

(;B[nh]C[This move is not good.  It has no effect on the white group, and doesn;t surround the right side.]
;W[ii]
(;B[ij]C[This move is not good.  You have to defend this stone, and it only takes a small territory in the center.  You should continue to attack instead.]
;W[ji];B[hj];W[hi]
(;B[gj]C[This move is not good.  It defends a few points.  you should attack white instead.]
;W[ml]C[now white is almost out.];B[mm];W[nm];B[lm];W[ni]TR[nl]
C[Ouch.  This point should have been black's.  White defends the cut in sente.]
;B[oi];W[qd]C[This looks like a very good move by white. I have a hard time deciding where to play at this point.]
;B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[qf];B[pe];W[rg];B[se];W[sf];B[rf];W[gg]
;B[gf];W[re]C[You can just connect and take the corner.  There will still be a ko.  It's hard for white to live here.]

(;B[nn];W[sd]C[You must complete your ko threat now and kill the center group.]

(;B[rc]C[This is the worst result.  White wins the ko, and sente besides. When you make a ko threat, your intention must be to follow through if it is ignored.  If you won't folow through with your threat, then it was not a real threat, and you should find something better.

This result is the same as if white answered your ko threat, and still won the ko.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[ri];B[rj];W[om]C[Mistake.  White should live in the upper right.]
;B[qh]C[Good.  kill white.];W[rh];B[qg];W[pf]
(;B[of]C[You can defend at Q10 instead.];W[qi]C[White finds a good threat here.]

(;B[pg]C[Oops.  This move needs to be at Q12, and black should win.]
;W[pj];B[ql];W[oh]C[Nice move for white, saving both weak groups.]

(;B[rf]C[After this my game falls appart.

Thank you for taking the time to review my game!

This move is bad, since capturing two stones is just endgame. You should defend your weak group on the right.  This just uses up a ko threat.

The game is still close, so don't give up!];W[ph];B[qn];W[qo]
;B[ro];W[rp];B[po];W[qp];B[on];W[np]C[Black can still win this game.  White lived, but doesn't have much territory.  It's important not to give up when you make a mistake.  Count the score and see if the game is still close.]
;B[mp]C[Attaching here gives white torritory at the bottom.  I don't see anything better locally though.]

;B[rb];W[bi];B[di];W[ci];B[ab]C[This move is bad.  It just wastes a ko threat.  S6 is big.]
;W[bb];B[fb];W[eb];B[fh]C[This move is small and gote.  S6 is much bigger.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gi];B[fi]C[Small.  Is there a point here?  S6 is much bigger.]
;W[rn];B[rm];W[so]C[Now the game is very close.];B[gp];W[gq]
;B[gh];W[ig];B[hh]C[There are no points to be gained here in the center.  This sequence just forces white to capture some of your stones.
