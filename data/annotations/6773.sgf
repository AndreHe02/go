C[Hello I'm BinX, playing Black in this game.

It was my first game for a long time, and i'm not proud of it...
I had an ugly victory, I think.

Any comment is welcome, since it's my first review. I'll add a few comments to help you to see what I was thinking, or what bothers me.

And I'm french, so if you speak french, don't hesitate... (and if not, sorry for my bad english)

Thanks for your time !

zaphod: hi, my comments are prefixed by Z:];B[pp]C[BinX [11k?\]: hi
BinX [11k?\]: good game];W[dd]C[vib [10k\]: hi gg];B[cp];W[qc]
;B[eq];W[nq]LB[dj:A]C[Z: the ordinary direction for B to expand his lower left shimari is along the left side, so W might be better off limiting that extension with a move around A.]
;B[pn];W[kq]LB[pr:A]C[Z: this allows B the opportunity to either close the corner at A with big profit, or ignore W's purely defensive move.]
;B[iq]C[Z: wrong direction.  left side bigger.  it's also gote, as W doesn'y have to respond in order to live.]
;W[ql]LB[no:A]C[I didn't think that he would attack the corner by both sides in this situation...

Z: this is a typical high handicap game move by W, looking to provoke trouble.  it's an overplay in an even game. simplest answer is at A.]
;B[qm]TR[qc][ql]C[Z: attachment is for defence, but B should be thinking about attack.  there is a wide gap between the two marked stones.]
;W[pl];B[pr]TR[pl][ql]SQ[kq][nq]C[with this corner - maybe too slow ? - I thought I can attack the L3-O3 stones and keep them separated from the R8 group, or tenuki and take a big point.

I chose to attack...

Z: you did?! this looks like a purely defensive move to me.  anyway, triangled stones are more vulnerable than the squared ones.]
;W[or]LB[qh:A]C[Z: unnecessary.  A better.];B[no]LB[qh:A]C[Z: also unnecessary. if W now plays A, all B will have achieved is separating two strong groups.]
;W[ko]C[Z: probably a good idea to keep from being fenced in, but the right side is more urgent and the left side more valuable.]
;B[mq]C[Here I misread, I don't even thought that he could connect underneath... To my shame I guess.

Z: no shame in Go!  just mistakes of judgement :)];W[mr];B[lp]
C[Z: ugly];W[kp];B[lr]C[Z: uglier!];W[lq]C[Z: of course!];B[mp]
C[Z: the worst move of all so far.  it is worth maybe 2 points, whereas sente in the opening is worth about 30 points]

(;W[kr]C[I'm a bit stubborn when I fail... bad habit...

But I think that I could use the sente to approach the san-san. It's the first time that I have to do this sort of approach, so I'll accept all your tips. I'll explain my thoughts.

Z: this is not sente.  see variation.];B[od]C[I thought against san-san, I had to take good influence... so I tried...

Z: wrong direction.  split the right side instead.];W[pe];B[qg]
C[I'm not proud of this move, because I was thinking that he will play something low, without even thinking that he could simply separate my two stones...

Z: right.  good that you see this.];W[qf]LB[nl:A]C[But I guess I'm lucky ?

Z: nope.  by leaning on you here, W prepares to spring on the upper side.  his triangled stones can still escape to the centre by jumping to A.]
;B[of]C[Z: overambitious.  you can't do everything at once.]
;W[qi]C[Z: fair, but see how the extension is narrower than it should have been.]
;B[oh]LB[oe:A]C[Z: quite good, but there is still a weakness at A, so not very good.]
;W[oi]C[Z: slow.  top side more important now.];B[ni]LB[jd:A]
[dj:B]C[Z: yuk!  both players are playing with narrow vision.  The big points are still open.]
;W[oj];B[nj];W[nl]C[at this point, I thought that attack this group would hurt me... There may be a way though...

Z: see my previous comment];B[dj]LB[fc:A]TR[od][of][qg][oh]
[ni][nj]C[Z: at last! but if i were B here, i would probably prefer to use the triangle stones to try for a moyo on the uper centre, starting with A]
;W[ch];B[fc]
(;W[ec]LB[fe:A][dl:B]C[Z: hasty.  if B gets his moyo, the game will be difficult for W.  Instead, maybe A, pressing B down and building strength for a later invasion around B.]

(;B[fd]LB[jc:A]C[Z: thoughtless.  W already has an extension along the left side, so B won't have time to complete the normal joseki at A.  See variation.]
;W[ic];B[kc]TR[fc][fd]C[Z: pincers are for attack, but should be made with support on the other side.  here, B is provoking W to pincer his  triangled stones in return.  See variation on W's next move.]

;B[de];W[da];B[ed];W[fa];B[cm]
(;W[gn]TR[ko][kp][kq][kr]C[I thought that I could give this game for a review when I saw this move, I had no idea of dealing with it.

Z: this is a very poor move by W.  It is too far from the wall to be securely linked and just invites B to build territory while threatening to eat it.  See variation.]

(;B[ho]C[I threat separation, but I'm thinking "keep territory"]
;W[hn];B[fn]C[When I see this move now, I have the impression of asking white to play G5...

This move was here to guard left territory, but I guess I'm too greedy ?

There is no way that white let me take a so huge corner... I think I'd play G5 myself now...

Z: see my previous comment];W[go];B[gp];W[fo];B[eo];W[fp];B[gq]
;W[io];B[hp];W[im];B[hm];W[gm];B[hl]C[Z: another example of narrow thinking. saving one stone is only worth 2 points.]

C[I misread the ladder, but, at  this point, I thought that I could use this four stones to separate the O8 group from here...

Z: saving 3 stones is only worth 6 points.  no further comments.]
