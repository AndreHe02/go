C[Hi!

I played this game as black. The time setting was 10.00 minutes + 5 x 25 sec byoyomi. I am interested in the whole game, but I I felt like my game was weak in the middle game, especially the later part of it. I feel like I often succeed at building good influence but fail to use it to my advantage. In this game, I also think I continued to build it for too long to get to use it properly.

Thank you in advance for the review!

Hi, I'm Lib 1K, and I'll be your reviewer for this game! :)

;W[dp];B[pq]C[AMak [6k\]: hi];W[dd];B[qk];W[nc];B[lc]C[I usually play Q14 here but this time I felt like pincering.

Playing on the right side would be more consistant with your strategy, since you've already invested an additional stone on the right. But IMO its not that big a problem if you know what you're doing]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[jc]C[This is exactly the situation B would want to avoid with the pincer. W's O-group can keep jumping to restrict B's right side AND attack the B M-group. W's K-group, while attacking the M-group, strengthens the left.]

(;B[ng]C[I also considered P12. It's not so moyo-oriented but it seals the side territory better.

This is slightly inconsistent. If you wanted moyo you shouldn't have pincered. Notice that your top right is slightly "squashed" due to the M17-O15 exchange. Also, notice that the corner is not yet secure, so if W plays there, B is likely to suffer an overconcentration of stones in that area.]
;W[kd];B[fq];W[dn]
(;B[dr];W[cq]
(;B[ip]C[awkward];W[kq]C[I noticed I didn't quite know how to react to this. My plan was to make it a running group and try to profit somehow.

Yeah this is the problem with the previous move. W attacks UNDER the J4 group, and any counter attacks like N3 also leads to an overconcentration of B stones at the bottom right.]

(;B[jq]C[valient effort, but kinda inefficient for the J4 group. You can consider giving up the bottom for more influence, since J4 is already above W's attacking group (see variation).]
;W[jr]
(;B[ir]C[you could consider taking the outside instead. It's already clear that the J4 group isn't going to yield much territory anymore.]
;W[jp];B[iq];W[kp];B[mq]C[too low. Consider N4 or N5 instead. this N3 yields about 10 points at te bottom, whereas sacrificing the bottom and making a moyo can potentially win the game.]
;W[js]C[way too slow.];B[is]C[This was probably bad? Locally M2 may have been better? To poke away the eye.

Both of you made the same strategic error in this area. While basic Go knowledge advocates making stable groups as soon as possible, at such an early stage, both groups are in no immediate danger. Jumping out with L6 for W would not only secure more eye space, but also act an a launching pad for future attacks on B's right side moyo.

As for B, your group is already pretty much alive. M2 would indeed have been better, although such plays are too small. Consider tenuki and playing somewhere like N5]
;W[lr];B[cf]C[Good that you did not respond to M2. N2 is also too small at this stage]
;W[ce];B[df];W[fd];B[cj];W[cl]C[too narrow for W. B gains in this exchange]
;B[pn]C[Now when I look at this it seems kind of misplaced. I considered playing N5 or Q5 also. I had also for some time wanted to do something active with the M17 stone against O15 and O17.

N5 is the best option locally. your Q3 stone already makes any attacks in that region difficult.

However, keep in mind that due to the previous exchange (W C8), B needs something like E10. W C12 is very dangerous.]
;W[qn];B[qo];W[po]
(;B[oo]C[Usually I would have extended, but now as I can capture the cutting stone I thought I should.

Consider the other variations. This capture leads to an overconcentration of B at the bottom right, a problem made worse by M2 (so the bottom right is probably going to end up quite small).]
;W[pm];B[on];W[ro];B[qp];W[qm]
(;B[rp]C[It may have been more important to seal white in and possibly let him live small and get a good outward influence.

yes. due to Q3 and N3, B's corner is very difficult to kill. Any play is this area should aim to restrict W. Consider tenuki: B can still block the corner from W at S3.]
;W[so];B[sp]C[Again, I feel like this is not good play.

same thing as J1];W[rm]C[Now would be a good time to seal white in also?

Yep!]
(;B[rk]C[slow. P8 might have been better, but i'm not too sure, the W L3 group is troublesome (see variations). Strategically, sealing W in is a good choice, but I'm not sure if there's any way to properly execute it.]
;W[pk];B[pj];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[mm]C[These plays here are for attacking L3 group.

Good. Split up the 2 W groups and attack the weaker one.];W[om]
;B[nm];W[nl];B[in]C[weak attack. K6 might have been better.]
;W[nr]C[Bad move];B[mr]C[Good.];W[ms];B[nq];W[or];B[pr];W[jn]
;B[jm]C[Here I should've used more time as I had plenty.

No matter. If B aims to seal W in and kill it, this is the only move. The alternative is to let W run and expand this into an epic battle]
;W[kn];B[km];W[io];B[ho];W[jo];B[hn];W[lo]C[Since killing the white group would've been nice.

Actually W is still not alive. (See variation)]
(;B[ln];W[lq];B[mp];W[lp];B[cr]C[Also, B might be in danger.]

(;W[br];B[bk];W[bl]C[good series of exchanges];B[cc];W[dc];B[be]
;W[cd];B[bd];W[bc];B[cb]C[Normally good to give the opponent some headache but now I probably should have let it be and maybe at some point in the endgame I would have got to play A17 in sente.]
;W[bb]
(;B[ff]C[I like this move, but maybe now it was the time to finally use M17?

it depends on your future plans.

F14 allows B to aim at the top left W group, possibly threatening to activate the C18 group.

Alternatively, B could play E9, sealing W's bottom left and forming a continuous wall with the H6 group. 

M14 forces W to block off M17, and then B can follow up with N10 to expand B's right side group.

I'd probably play something like this: (see variation)];W[lf]
;B[he];W[hd];B[ie];W[id]
(;B[ge]C[Looking at this now after the game, I feel like the time to build walls and use influence is maybe over and I should have been more concerned about making territory and reducing white's upper side.

It's not over, but this move is slow. Consider what happens if B doesnt play here: (see variation)]
;W[ck]C[slow.]
(;B[bj];W[fk];B[fi];W[dj];B[di];W[ej];B[ei];W[ig]C[Here I figured to attack the white stone on J13 but now I think it has too many directions to go to so I probably should've just tried to maximize my own territory at this point. Playing somewhere like P18/Q18 probably would have been better.

Also A8 would probably be better than what I played.

No. B has a decent chance of killing J13.];B[jf]C[good];W[ii]

(;B[jg]C[Sealing white in and killing it was too ambitious. And I was playing too fast at this point.

This move is not strictly necessary, W is already alive, so the 3 stones are worth merely 6 points.]

Yes. You need to play calmly and avoid getting caught up in the action. Try to take at least 5 seconds at the start of every turn to reassess the entire situation and decide if its worth to continue playing locally.]

[rs][ss]C[The game was a bit of a waste, B could have won rather easily. The end game moves that you pointed out but unfortunately didn't get a chance to play are all quite large, and were the finishing blows that cost B the game. Overall, you need to be more consistant in the opening with regards to direction (do I want the right side? or the top?). In the midgame, you need to estimate the value of moves (can I play elsewhere? When W attacks in the middle of my side, should I counter attack from the left? right? or seal him in?). In the endgame, you need to spend more time deciding on the biggest points of the board (Is this move sente? Can I chain a sequence of moves in sente to grab all the large endgame moves? When getting forced by such a chain by the opponent, can I break out of it? Is that sente of his really sente?)

That's all!
Hope the review's useful! :)

I would prefer this. W's D6 gives B the option of taking the corner sometime later anyway.]

(;B[le]C[Maybe this, because white didn't play L16? The diagonal play at L16 seems too slow.

It's not slow, just a possibly premature. L16 strengthens the W K-group BUT also helps B's M-group. W has the option of O13 at anytime. but if the M-group becomes overly strong, W can still play R17 for the corner and give up the O-group]
