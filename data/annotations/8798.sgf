C[Dear reviewer this was an exciting game I played recently in which I lost by a narrow margin I would like a review for both players please. Thx in advance

Hi Robert!
I am Karen Ogg, 1d AGA and will do my best to point out all that I see.

I consulted a 4d friend for backup, so some of the comments are his.]

makes white thicker
