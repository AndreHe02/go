Overall comments:
Both players need to improve their tactical reading skills. Solving live&death problems and studying tesuji would probably work miracles. Both should also think about the stratetic implications of some crucial moves that were missed in the game (cutting/connecting stones).]


;B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[dc];B[pj];W[nq];B[qn]TR[kp][lq][no]C[Although this is not wrong, it looks a little defensive and slow. A more active approach is to play a pincer at M3 or L4. O5 is also a possibility.]
;W[jp];B[fc]TR[ce][de][jc]C[A very unusual approach to a 3-4 stone. I have never seen it before, so I don't know what it means. The normal move is to prevent White from making a corner enclosure with a move at C15 or D15, or to play K17.

;W[qf]TR[ce][de][hc][ic]C[Simply answering Blacks unusual move at C15 or D15 would be ok. The Black stone at F17 then need defending. White can also try a pincer around H17.]

[jc]C[Question : Where is the best place instead of C17 ?

Hard to tell, there are probably no josekis for this position. Locally, a move at D18 is possible, but it's quite small at this stage (as it is gote). Black probably should play around K17 instead, or switch to the lower left side.]

TR[jd][df]C[Question : Is it better plced at D14 ?

This kind of move can only be played if it works and serves some purpose (which it doesn't in this case). Around K16 is better. Pressing down with D14 is also a possibility.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[ef];W[dg];B[mf]C[I want to attack the right 3 white stones.

Good. It also builds a large moyo on the upper side.];W[oc]
C[I think this is an overplay. White can't invade now with the weak stones on the outside. At least one of the White groups should die, if not both.]

(;B[rg]C[Should I placed S17 before S13 ?

Black should not play S13 at all. White is only too happy to connect.
Black can however play S17 (see variation), but it's end-game and not urgent.]
;W[rf];B[ri];W[ra]TR[qa]C[Better at R19. (No point in threatening with a ko, when you can threaten to live. :)]
;B[ma];W[rc];B[cn];W[cl];B[fq];W[eo]TR[dn][fp]C[A bit unorthodox. The normal follow-up after the C8 pincer is to play D6 (when Black didn't play the more common E6 or C3), but White F4 is also possible.]
;B[fo];W[en]C[This exchange is a "family feud". Black is hurting his own stone at C6, and pushing White from behind on the fifth line. Not good. The normal move (instead of F5) is C3.]
;B[oq]C[This is only good when Black has a stone at K4. In this situation Black must play Q2 to seal the corner, or attack with M3.]
;W[mp]C[Should be O4. N4 leaves a weak spot at M3 (just as Black has one at R3 now).
O4 would turn K4 into a good extension (three lines from a two-stone wall).]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr];W[fn];B[go];W[if]C[Probably a good reduction. Hard for Black to just defend, and hard to capture.]

C[Is this stone necessary ?

It's probably wise to play here, even if I think it's possible to play other moves (like L7, but then it gets complicated).
However, it's better to play M3 instead, as this leaves no bad aji. Now there is an atari at M3 or N2 to exploit at some point.]

No, L5.];W[ko];B[il]TR[kn][km][lm][mm]C[This doesn't work. White can now capture the marked stones immediately if he wants.]

There are some weaknesses in White's shape in the lower left part of the board that requires some reading. Look at the moves K7, D8 and E9...]
