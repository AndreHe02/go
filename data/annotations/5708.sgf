C[This game is played good i thing, I couldn't say anything bettar to do.
May be the left upper corner is not played well, and I've lost some points.

Thanks for your help in improving myself];B[pd];W[dp];B[cd]
;W[pp];B[cn];W[fp];B[ck]C[[jhouse\] This seems a bit strange to me.  Normally you exchange B4 for C3 before playing this move.  If not, then normally you jump back a bit further (C10).]
;W[ec]C[I mean this sequence];B[ed]C[[jhouse\] Your side stones are rather low and I feel the gap to C9 is kind of small.  I fear this exchange would leave you over concentrated.  Maybe pincer here?  Note that I don't really know 3-4 joseki.]
;W[fd];B[ee];W[dc];B[fe];W[gd];B[ce]C[[jhouse\] This move doesn't seem to achieve enough.  consider C14 or C17.  I like the look of D12, but white pushing through at D16 looks like it could hurt too much.]
;W[qf];B[nc];W[pj]C[[jhouse\] I'm not happy with black's position here.  I feel that the upper right corner is rather vulnerable.  The exchange you follow up with only hurts the corner.  Maybe extend along the top to pressure the upper left corner for white?]
;B[cc];W[jc];B[kq]C[[jhouse\] The positioning of your stone leaves a good extension for any approach, but I wonder if a move like H3 might be better.  Since white's corner is weak, allowing them to approach you from that side almost seems too good for them.]
;W[iq];B[nq];W[pn];B[pq]C[[jhouse\] To take a part of the corner, I think Q2 works better.  (I think it leaves more aji for later reduction of white)]
;W[qq];B[qp];W[qo];B[rp];W[qr];B[pr];W[ro];B[op];W[po];B[qe]
C[[jhouse\] Having to do this really hurts.  I'd look hard for alternatives.  Maybe P14?]
;W[pf]C[[jhouse\] How do moves like O14 for white look?  I'd say this position is too good for white.  They can really build up their territory a lot.]
;B[cp]C[[jhouse\] It's important to end this attack in sente.  I'm thinking that it may have been best to build the left side through gentle pressure on white instead of a direct attack.  Thae wall at E15 is doing little if white can reduce from the outside.]
;W[cq];B[dq];W[ep];B[bp];W[cr];B[bq];W[dl];B[cl];W[dk];B[en]
C[[jhouse\] Instead of here, I think D10 is bigger.  The left side is key to black.  If white does connect near this play, black can jump out around L5 and prevent much build up for white.]

;W[dj]TR[ej]C[What do you think about this cut?

[jhouse\] It looks rather strange to me.  I'd probably have been tempted to do D10 directly and either get a cut or build the left while leaving white weak.  Saving the black stone encourages a reduction of the left side.  I think some of white's extension into the center (attacking the stone) eventually led to territory that hurt your final position.]
;B[ek];W[fl];B[gj];W[hl];B[gk];W[fm];B[fi];W[eh];B[fh]C[[];W[jo]
;B[di]C[[jhouse\] I think this may be too small.  I think it can end in gote for you and white can then build the center area pretty easilly.  I think a move near M5/O6 is key to keeping white from building up.  If this is too small, then so was F12.  The move by white at K5 seems to help their position too much.]
;W[ch];B[dh];W[ci];B[dg];W[pl];B[ko];W[jn];B[kn];W[km];B[jp]
;W[ip];B[jm]C[[jhouse\] I think you should follow up with this attack.  Plays near M7 will really help to reduce white's potential in the center]
;W[hn];B[id]C[[jhouse\] Consider M17 in prep for an attack (such as H17)]
;W[ic];B[hd];W[hc];B[ge];W[oh];B[ij];W[jl];B[dr];W[br];B[fr]
;W[fq];B[ar];W[er];B[cs];W[eq];B[bs];W[lm];B[ke]C[[jhouse\] Consider threatening to build territory with L10.  It's closer to white's potential territory and will help reduce while potentially building for yourself.]

[jhouse\] This move could have been avoided earlier by trying to limit white's potential in the center (such as continuing with the cut threat at K7]
