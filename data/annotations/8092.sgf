RE[B+Resign]

C[Hi, thank you for reviewing my game. I played white in this game and felt like my opponent controlled the game. I ended up reducing a moyo but got attacked and could never catch up. As usual, I've added some comments/questions, but would appreciate all help you can offer. Thanks!

(;B[fq]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[First things first.

As a guideline you should not pincer when an opponent plays from the side of his own stones. You should follow this until you are dan level and really know what you are doing, or you are purposefully looking to either confuse your opponent or just mess around.

You should pretty much always play A or B in this situation]
(;W[ip];B[cn];W[fp];B[cq]
(;W[eq];B[cp]C[At this point you have sente to play what you like.]
(;W[gq]C[I've never played this sequence before, and I don't like how it turned out here- W used too many stones and didn't get much from them. Is there a better way to handle the corner after B c6?

Before you made this move, the situation wasn't that bad yet, however this move is a complete waste at this point.]

(;W[om]C[Now here at the very least you should tenuki, this move is a complete waste.

If you really really want to capture that stone, you should just capture it at Q7 instead of leaving that peep for your opponent.]
;B[pn];W[pm];B[jd]C[The last 14 moves seem pretty logical, but b has a better position now.]
;W[qc]C[Was this too early?

You might want to think about invading at H17 before playing this, however your opponent doesn't play this very well so it wouldn't have mattered.]
;B[pc];W[qd];B[qe];W[re]
(;B[qf];W[pb];B[ob];W[qb];B[nc]C[Now you need to invade.]
(;W[ec]C[This move takes away your possible invasion and gives your opponent a wonderfully stong moyo.]

(;W[fb]C[to prevent c17

C17 is small and you shouldnt worry about it yet.];B[gb];W[jg]
C[I didn't think this was too deep, but...

This of course is not too deep,  and black of course needs to defend, however black can defend by attacking.]
;B[ji]C[he attacked anyway];W[hg]C[Black shouldn't play the forcing moves yet.]
(;B[de];W[ce];B[ed];W[db];B[fg]C[I didn't expect that from b, but now the w stones are cramped]
;W[ii]C[This is a good move, the move i would have played, white is not in trouble at all.]
;B[jj]
(;W[jh]LB[kf:A]C[trying to make eyeshape, maybe incorrect

Yes this is clearly a bad move. white needs to go out not get blocked in. And in the case white is confident of getting out even when tenukiing, then white should just reduce blacks moyo more while possibly strengthening himself by playing at A for example.]
;B[hi]C[This surprised me

Im guessing that black wanted to stop you from getting the shape, but this isn't really good.]
(;W[hh];B[gi];W[ij];B[jk];W[je]C[It's not a good idea to play here, this just let's black defend his territory and doesn't seriously reduce it, you should just continue out.

When black decides to defend this area, you'll have sente.]

(;B[lh];W[hk]C[I gave up living inside and just ran];B[il];W[fk]
C[and again];B[kp]C[but now B is gaining from his attack and I'm falling further behind

Black didn't really gain anything from his attack, he didnt really get any extra points, the thickness he got isn't really doing anything and his previous moyo area is still open for further reduce.
What black did get is sente though, however thats to be expected since you were the one who started the reduce.]
;W[mh]C[trying to limit B points here

Black has very few points here anyways so there are much bigger moves on the board.]

C[but it didn't quite work out

No, this is quite good for you, you reduced black a bit and now black cant bring out his f3 stone. The black area was already quite tough so you shouldn't expect more than this]

Ye, you can't really catch up to black anymore at this point so resignation was correct.]
