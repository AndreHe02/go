C[Hi. My name is Roland and I'll review your game.

Please don't take anything I write as absolute truth. Try to verify for yourself why something is better or worse. First of all, you'll learn more that way. And more important, it's not that unlikely that I make mistakes, too ;)]

(;W[qo]C[Locally, this move is good. But there is a weak black group on the board, and I think it's better to attack it. See variation.]
(;B[np]C[This move tries to build something on the bottom side in exchange for the corner. Generally speaking, moves on the fourth line are for influence. But in this position, influence along the bottom side is uninteresting, because there is not much potential for further developement in this direction. So in this particular case, this move is not very good.

See variation.];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[oq];W[rq];B[kq];W[jp]C[This area is not so important right now. The black group is stable for now. Better take one of the big points on the board, or even better, attack the two black stones on the left side.]
;B[kp];W[jo];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd];W[df]
(;B[he]C[At this point, black has two weak groups on the board. Therefore, it's important to settle one of them as fast as possible. The best opportunity to do that is pressuring the two white stones at the top. But with this move, you leave a weakness that white can exploit.

See variations.]
(;W[ko]C[This exchange doesn't really help white that much.
Black has two weak groups on the board. Better attack one of them, or even better, both at once.
See variations.];B[lo];W[cl]C[Don't touch the stones you are attacking. Contact plays always make both groups stronger. As attacker, you want the opponent's group to stay weak.
Contact plays are for defense, when the opponent is already strong and you want to strengthen your own group.]
;B[dl];W[dm];B[ck];W[cn];B[bl];W[bn];B[em];W[dn];B[ek]C[Suddenly, the black group is very strong. I'd say it's pretty much unconditionally alive. There are not even good forcing moves against it.
This also indirectly strengthens the black group at the top, since there is no splitting or leaning attack, and it has a safe group to run towards and connect. And that in turn weakens the white stones at the top side.

Suddenly the roles are reversed. At move 35, black had the two weakest groups on the board. Now, white has the weakest group.]
;W[fg]C[Now this move "just" attacks one group. Black can concentrate on defending the top without worrying about consequences on the left side, since the left side is stable for now. The attack also comes from the wrong direction. The white stones on the left are already stable, but the stones at the top could use some help.]
;B[lc]C[Now, this move is not an overplay anymore. See variation on the next move.]
(;W[ld];B[kc];W[kd];B[jc]C[Now the situation is completely reversed. All black stones are fairly strong, and white has a weak group.]
(;W[qi]C[With the weak group at the top, this is an overplay. Ok, it reduces the right side, but it creates another weak group. See variation on this and next move.]
(;B[qm];W[rm];B[rn];W[qn];B[rl];W[pm]
(;B[ql]C[Better capture directly. This just gives white a free forcing move. See variations.]
;W[ro];B[sm];W[oi];B[pj];W[pi]
(;B[om]C[Better just jump out, separating white. See variation.]
;W[rr];B[pn]C[Doesn't really do anything. The single white stone is not that important, and the black group can live any time with S10, or run out, so it is stable. Better attack one of the weak white groups.]
(;W[qc]C[Overplay. White has two weak groups, one at the top and one at the right side. The 3-3 invasion makes black stronger locally. See variation.]
(;B[qd]C[Definitely the wrong direction. This misses the chance to split white and attack severely. When dealing with weak groups, as attacker you always want to cut off the escape route first. As defender, you always want to connect your groups together, because bigger groups are generally stronger. See variation.]
;W[pc];B[qg];W[md]C[Again, the roles have reversed. Now white has a fairly strong group at the top, and the black group in the top right is weak. This indirectly helps the white stones on the right side.]

(;B[ij]C[I think the other cut is more important, since this group doesn't have two eyes on its own when separated from the left side group.]

See variations.];B[kn]C[Now black is connected and alive. White has only one eye, so white has to defend.]

[nr][as][bs][ds][ms]C[All in all, I think this was a very interesting game to review. The fuseki was very good, there was not much to criticise, just a few minor mistakes.

I think the biggest weakness of both players in this game was the handling of weak groups in the middle game. The first really big mistake in the game was the sequence started by white 38. It completely reversed the balance of power in this game. Before the sequence, the black groups were weak, afterwards there was a weak white group. A bit later, at move 71, black made exactly the same mistake by letting the white 3-3 invasion connect to the outside. As a result, the formerly weak white group was made strong, and a black group turned weak.

I think both of you can easily improve a few stones by just remembering two principles when attacking weak groups:
1) Don't touch the stones you are attacking.
2) Always cut off the escape route first.

Just concentrate on that in your games, and you'll see how much difference a single weak group can make to the whole game ;)]

[in][lo][kp]C[Or even simpler. No matter whose turn it is, you can play L6 almost without thinking.

That kind of move is extremely important when the groups in question are not already independantly alive. Even when no group will die, it's still better to connect than having to live small locally (usually in gote). And it's twice as important when both players are in the same position.]

(;W[nf]C[I'm not sure what exact move is best in this situation, but this is one possibility. It loosely connects the two weak groups, and attacks the two black stones in the corner. When black secures the corner, white can secure the weak groups. When black tries to get out, it's a complicated fight. I can't predict what will happen, but black can't really attack severely as long as the corner is not secure...

The main point is that white must defend both weak groups. And the best way to defend two weak groups is to connect them, making a single stronger group.]
