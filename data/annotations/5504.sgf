AB[pd][dp]C[tokugawa: Let's begin and enjoy a great game.

Daedin: 
Hello.
I tried and focused on the points you mentioned - that is the beginning and middle game. However please keep in mind that my comments may not provide the most accurate answer or best alternative.]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[fq];B[hq];W[fo];B[er]C[Playing at D6 or C6 would be better here?

Daedin: D6 seems like the standard move to me, since it aims at building a moyo on the left while chasing White stones to the center. C6 is too far from the White stones to be efficient. 
By letting White to play a move around D5, Black lets White build influence toward the top and the center and a chance to settle his stones.]
;W[do];B[ep];W[fp];B[co];W[dn];B[cn];W[nq]C[Daedin: Wrong side for White, since it allows Black to play L3 and thus settling his stone and nullating the effect of White's three stones]
;B[lq]C[Daedin: Good direction. M3 seems a little far from H3, since it allows White K3 later on, so maybe L3 is a little better.]
;W[pq]
(;B[np]C[Daedin: This move lets White settle easily in a relatively huge corner. Maybe a move around R3 that would prevent White from settling his stones and chase him toward the center]
;W[qp];B[po];W[qo]C[Daedin: Feels like Black let White get the corner a little too easily. 
Daedin: White stones were outnumbered, and now there are settled with a big corner, and have possitilities on the right side.]
;B[ql]C[Should Black attack the lower right corner? How?

Daedin: The lower corner feels safe for White now.];W[pn];B[no]
;W[qf]C[Daedin: Wrong direction - O17 is better.];B[qh];W[od]
;B[pe];W[pf];B[oe];W[nd];B[of];W[pg]
(;B[ph]C[Daedin: Pressing with P13 seems better, since it allows Black to come out in the center]

;W[cd];B[ee];W[ek];B[dj]C[Daedin: Seems small. It may be time to attack the O16 stones with a move around M16]
;W[hp];B[iq];W[nf];B[pc];W[ne];B[nh];W[ng];B[oh]C[Daedin: Black ends gote, and White can still enter from the bottom]
;W[qe];B[nb];W[lc]
(;B[lb]C[Daedin: Playing on the second line is not good here. White closes its territory while Black gains almost nothing]
;W[kb];B[mb];W[jc]
(;B[ol]C[Daedin: A White move around G14 would give White a definite advantage, so Black has to prevent it]

;W[hl];B[gk]C[Daedin: No comments beyond this point
Black has missed the opportunity to reduce White's moyo at the top and let himself be enclosed in the upper right corner.

Aside from that, there was not huge blunders or mistakes.];W[gl]
