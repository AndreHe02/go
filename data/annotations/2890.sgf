C[In this KGS game, I played white, and lost by about twenty points.  I feel like my big mistake came early on, when I let (or maybe even helped) my opponent build a large, solid moyo in the upper left.  I often find my opponent has built these kind of structures in my games...

During the middle game I tried to fight to even the game, but never really could.

I'd mainly like advice on the opening through the first thirty moves or so.  I feel like the opening is the weakest part of my game, and I need to study it more.  Of course, I would certainly appreciate any other advice, pointing out mistakes, etc.

Thanks!

Note from the reviewer:
As usual, I have tried to make my best during this review. Hope it will be useful for the players and may be to some other readers.

However, please don't take my comment for the only truth as it should be full of mistakes for the truth of a dan player, and worst for the truth of a pro player.

As asked by the requestor (White), the review is more focused on the opening.

C[Was this the wrong direction to attack D4?  I thought about attacking from F3 instead, but I decided to try and break up my opponent's framework rather than building my own

Denis: My best choice is A, my second best is B. Why? Because an "influence" fight already started. The 3 opening stones at "4-4" points, are all oriented toward influence rather than securing the corner. That's why I think A is my first choice. It extend the influence of your upper right stone, while "reducing" the influence of the 2 upper left black stone.

I don't know if D4 or F3 is better, but I think you can wait a little and play A instead.]
;B[fq];W[ck];B[ci];W[en]TR[fq]LB[bp:A][cq:B]C[Denis: what about B4 (A), It's simple and gives you a better base.

if black answers B then his marked stone is not correctly placed (should be at F4)]
;B[qn]LB[jd:A][pj:B]C[Denis: good. Thought black could also play at A. If white B, the game is even.]
;W[ql]LB[pj:A][qj:B][np:C]C[Denis: I cannot say this is a bad move. but I would have played more lightly at A or B, or simply at C.]
;B[pm];W[np];B[nn];W[kp]C[Since black's next move is at K3, which threatens to cause trouble by sliding underneath later, does this mean I would have been better to play on the third line here?

Denis: Depends on your goal. If you want to secure some territory, then the answer to your question is "yes", thought the corner is still opened. If you want to use this move to strike back later, then L4 is better.]
;B[jq];W[jd]LB[hq:A][hp:B]C[I was upset with the L4, K3 exchange, but decided against adding a second stone at L3, since there was still much to do on the board.  Was K16 ok?

Denis: L3? it's an option, but it's small at this moment. K16? perfectly correct. It's the biggest point. To come back to my previous comment, you can still put L4 to work by using it to attack at A or B.]
;B[qf];W[qh]LB[qj:A]C[Denis: This move leaves a weak point at A. I would have played one point below.]
;B[of];W[nd];B[rd];W[qc];B[mf]C[Denis: White should be happy that black is not more aggressive. He could have play better and attack the 2 whites stones on the right.]
;W[pl]C[I felt pretty good about 19-26, because even though black isn't weak, I have built territory on either side of him.

Denis: You can be happy. Black should not have let the exchange 25 for 26. too bad for him, and too good for you.]
;B[ol];W[pj]LB[ok:A]C[Denis:  Overconcentrate. A is better. If black answers, take initiative elsewhere.]
;B[hc];W[ic]LB[cd:A][ce:B][fc:C][he:D]C[My goal was to protect territory on the top, but it seems I was ignoring my opponents goal.

But even after realizing how bad 30 is for me, I can't find the move I should have done to prevent black's moyo from growing out of control.

Denis: Your analysis is correct and that's a very good point for you. As you wrote, you should not protect territory (which is still opened, BTW), but reduce black moyo instead. Where? This is the very big question. I don't know the answer. I tried some invasion in the corner, or at A and B, but didn't find a successful follow-up for white. C? Also a difficult fight. So why not simply D?]
;B[he]C[30, 31 seems like an awful exchange for me now...  Is there anything I should have done now to reverse the damage I've done?

Denis:  The exchange is, indeed, clearly bad for you. You are behind by 5 to 10 points. So you must be more aggressive on the other black groups.]
;W[kf];B[nh];W[nj];B[lh]
(;W[cq]C[Denis: This attack is appealing, but I would have played as in the variation to give your group a good base to live, and avoid black spliting your group in two.]

[cn][en]C[My SGF editor (SmartGo) has an analysis engine that claims the bottom left corner is unsettled, but during the game, I did not feel I needed another move here...  Am I wrong?

Denis: Yes, you have to add a move, otherwise black can expect a KO. 

Althought the result of the invasion is better for you in terms of territory (about 5 points), you should also see that the invasion was not very good for you because you now have a weak group (marked stones).]
;W[qo]LB[qp:A]C[Denis: play simply at R4 (A) the corner is more secured and you still take life space for black group.]
;B[rn];W[rm]C[Denis: the corner is bigger.];B[rp]C[Denis: good black move.]
;W[ro]C[Denis: you cannot stop black from connecting. So secure some point in the corner, while still time.]
;B[so];W[pn]C[Denis: useless, and you'll end up by weakening your group just above.]
;B[on];W[po];B[qm];W[rl]C[Denis: see what I mean. You have no other choice and must play this move or have more difficulty. So Black take sente to invade further your corner. He is taking points but not you.]
;B[qq];W[pq];B[qr];W[pr];B[fo]C[Denis: Good. Avoid the cut and press the white group.]

C[Denis: dubious. What about A?];B[dm];W[dl];B[ej]C[Defending my weak group here has let black expand even further.  Now I see why he was more than happy to let me secure life by capturing D7.]
;W[cm];B[jg];W[if]LB[gi:A]C[Denis: I think you should erode from below at A.]

(;W[mj]C[Now that my other connections are cut off, I thought I needed N10.  Looking at it after the game, J2 could have helped me catch up!

Denis: N10 was not necessary if you play J2. Good reading from you, J2 is a tesuji to capture the 4 black stones. Black cannot cut both at J6 and N10 (see variations). The game would have been back to even.]
;B[in];W[hn];B[jn]
