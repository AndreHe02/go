C[Hi,
I am Siegfried. I was white in this game.

Although I won this game, in the early and middle game my situation is
very bad, all stone also under attack. So I would like to get a review
to teach me and make me better to play go. Thanks!


Sincerely,
Siegfried];B[qp];W[cp];B[qd];W[dd];B[eq];W[dq]C[D3 is considered bad if you don't control K3 or similar.  It is generally better to capture something along the left side as compensation for B taking the lower side (e.g. D6).  Alternativly you can pincer around G3 or similar.]
;B[ep];W[dp]C[D4 does not help W, b now has a nice little wall facing towards R4, w would be much better off playing c7 or similar]
;B[eo];W[oq]C[ok, b was being a bit greedy extending the wall to three stones and you've taken sente.  I would be a little concerned about b's pincer around M4 since it would work well with their three stones.]
;B[mq];W[qq];B[rp];W[rq];B[pp];W[pq];B[gc];W[ec];B[jd];W[cj]
;B[cn];W[bo]C[C6 isn't able to capture the corner, so B5 is very small.  You'd have been much better off dealing with the b walls (K4 or R8 or similar)]
;B[bk]C[this move helps white because it makes C10 strong];W[bj]
;B[bn];W[ck]C[good.  I'd have personally played E9 instead but C9 definatly shows the right idea]
;B[bl];W[cl]C[this isn't sufficiently forcing since w can't play b7 if b ignores]
;B[cm];W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[od]C[How about invading at s16 instead? that seems to fit better with R13 in place]

(;W[qc]C[you like complicated josekis don't you! I didn't start playing this one until 15k.
That is particularly dangerous there with very little space around S16 and P16 preventing w escaping in the other direction]
;B[rc]C[life is going to be hard now];W[rb];B[pc];W[qb]C[w is dead, P16 is too effective at preventing the escape.]
;B[rd]
(;W[pb];B[ob]C[try jumping to P18 rather than stepping to Q18, but really you're likely to lose it anyway.]
;W[oa];B[nb];W[iq]C[Good, j3 was important.  So now you've successfully eliminated the damage from B's wall on E3 to E5]
;B[cg]C[C13 is an erasing move, designed to make your big side small.  The best approach is usually to attack it indirectly while making your side larger, compensating for the damage it does.  E.g. F10 or F14]
;W[ce];B[eg];W[lq]C[M3 is a bit close to N3, N3 is a relativly weak stone and you should refrain from touching it.  Jumping out to J5 or J6 would have been better]
;B[op]C[this was the best you could have hoped for, M4 or N4 both lead to problems for W.]
;W[mr]C[score around B+20];B[er];W[dr];B[ir]C[odd, j2 is used to kill eyespace which seems a bit late now w has N2 connecting them to the corner]
;W[jr];B[ip];W[hr]C[careful doing this, the idea of j4 is to trap w onto the bottom without eyespace]

(;B[mp]C[b has obviously changed their mind, leaving them in a bad situation.  It is almost too late to pull out]
;W[hp];B[lp];W[jp];B[io];W[jo];B[in]C[think carefully about where the walls are building here.  B now has a six stone wall from M4 to S4, and if they play e.g. M8 that would give them over twenty points.  so K5 is influencing that wall, but may be too slow]
;W[gn]C[there were not many points here anyway, the big points are on the other side]
;B[kq];W[lr];B[jq]C[b has cut, but because L4 is forced you might get out ok.  You're going to have to be careful though, b's wall is now huge.  it might be faster to sacrifice the two stones and invade immediatly around N8.]
;W[is];B[kp];W[fm]C[wrong direction again.  while b needs A7 to live there is a fair chance still they could escape and get an eye elsewhere, and K10 or P9 are now huge]
;B[gq];W[hq];B[ho];W[go];B[gp];W[im];B[jn];W[jm];B[hm];W[hn]
;B[ko];W[hl]C[good, b missed the significance of the sacrifice, although L7 keeps building the b wall]
;B[gl];W[gm];B[gk];W[el];B[aj];W[ai];B[ak];W[bi];B[am];W[dn]
C[B should play C5 to connect their two groups or get b5 in compensation.  G8 was small and b should not have played it, L7 was much bigger]
;B[dl];W[dk];B[dm];W[em]C[b is now helping you, although now D5 saves the stones you have quite a nice looking wall.  Careful of the E9 cutting point though]
;B[do];W[en];B[co];W[hk]C[good, now b is too weak to cut without extending, but w if b just played G10?

score around W+10];B[ek]C[b doesn't seem to realise they are too weak]
;W[ej];B[gj]C[until too late];W[fk];B[fo]C[this move is pointless, b already had a bamboo join and two eyes]
;W[hj];B[gi];W[fh];B[fi];W[ei];B[eh];W[dh];B[dg];W[hi];B[gh]
;W[ng]C[good, now you are clearly alive here and can attack P8 etc much more agressivly.  the game is now about even.]
;B[bg]C[this is threatening a monkey jump to a16];W[ch]C[That seems overcautious to me, you have unlimited eyes around J8]
;B[ee];W[fd];B[cc]C[this is a tricky joseki to play];W[dc];B[cd]
;W[bd];B[bc];W[be];B[db];W[eb]
(;B[ea]C[b acknlowledges they are dead];W[cb];B[de];W[bb];B[da]
;W[fa];B[fe]C[this was a big win for you and you are now winning the game (just)]
;W[gd];B[he];W[hc];B[ic];W[gb]C[H18 better than G18];B[hd];W[ib]
C[hmmm?];B[hb];W[ha];B[hc];W[jb]C[this is very small, you still have the lower right to resolve]
;B[ge];W[jh]C[good, big move.  I personally would have gone on the other side where you both build your strength and erode blacks.]
;B[hh];W[ih]C[score around W+30];B[lh]
(;W[mj];B[lj];W[lm]C[good
you're now comfortably ahead];B[lg];W[me]C[and you get to threaten here in sente, very good]
;B[kf];W[ol]C[try to use knight jumps to avoid this problem, e.g. P9 instead of P8]
;B[pk];W[pj];B[ok];W[nl];B[nk];W[mk];B[ni]C[this is worrying, suddenly R10 doesn't look quite so alive]
;W[mi]C[risky, if you lose the upper right you'll lose the game]
;B[nh];W[oh];B[oi];W[pi];B[lk]C[fortunatly b misses their chance]
;W[li];B[mh];W[kj];B[km]C[this is all relativly small, only 15 pts in question.  the right is more important, P13, Q12 are still things to be worried about]
;W[kl];B[kh];W[ki];B[jg];W[pg]C[good, now you're safe];B[of]
;W[og];B[nf];W[lc];B[md];W[ld];B[le];W[nd]C[well spotted];B[mc]
;W[mb];B[nc];W[na];B[ne];W[kb];B[fc];W[ca];B[fb];W[ga]C[you can coast to victory from here.  P6 is probably the biggest thing left, and settling things like life in the lower left]
;B[qf];W[rf]C[score around W+40];B[re];W[rg];B[pf];W[on];B[pl]
;W[oo];B[kr];W[ks];B[nq];W[nr];B[nn];W[nm];B[mn];W[mm];B[ln]
C[all ok, now it is definatly time to settle in the lower left, once all your groups are definatly alive b is forced to resign]

;W[mg];B[mf];W[ig];B[if];W[hg];B[gg];W[mo]C[I'm presuming b resigned at this move]

;W[es]CR[es];B[fs]CR[fs];W[gs]CR[gs];B[ap]CR[ap]C[assuming you lose the corner you still win by 17.


Overally you played well.  You left the right side invasion until too late and b could have sealed it up and sealed up the game.  You also were not quite careful enough with your groups, losing the upper right corner and the right and group would have been disasterous.

It would also help if you were able to score a little more accuratly.  Cho Chikun publishes a book called 'high speed game analysis' discussing how he does this.  The free java program cgoban also has the ability to estimate the final score.

I think the main thing to look for is where your opponent's influence is growing and attempt to erase it before it gets too big.  B was quite good at doing this.]
