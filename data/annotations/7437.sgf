C[GOS: Hi there, Procyon. I'll be using "GOS", short for gostudent. Let's take a look, shall we?


Thank you so much for taking the time to review my game. I played black here, and ended up winning by a large margin, but was pretty uncertain through a lot of the game's early stages.

I've excised the (few) comments that Lambchop and I exchanged and added some questions and comments of my own.]

(;B[cj]C[GOS: I know how you feel about the opening. It can be quite perplexing on where to move and when to leave a group(s). I believe your move was valid. Your upper-right formation is a good shape, but you must keep in mind the threat of an invasion by white at R-12, or maybe even R-13. There is one thing other I see you really could have done here...


Was I correct to jump in where I did instead of continuing play on the right? Is this looking OK for me on that side? I have a lot of trouble in the opening; I tend to feel overwhelmed by all the choices.]
;W[cn];B[cf];W[fc];B[cd];W[cc];B[bd];W[bc];B[ac]C[GOS: This exchange is more endgame territory. There are bigger points on the board that need attention. The extension at K-17, or L-17 is looking a bit more tantilizing now, especially since white will want to extend that way, as well. 
Your group in the lower right needs attention... perhaps an attachment at  O-4, or the extension to R-2. R-2 stablizes your group, and O-4 extends your eye potential, as well as threatening to break into the center. I think it important to stablize first, though, otherwise your stones will be floating.
Lastly, you could push down on the N-9 stone, exending your moyo (large area of territory) in that area.]
;W[ab];B[ad];W[cb];B[lq];W[no]C[GOS: Here, you've helped to seal in your group. It could be a possibly good exchange if you plan to extend along the bottom, at J-3. However, you would first need to stabilize your group at R-2.]
;B[lo];W[mp];B[lp]C[At this point I started worrying a bit about my group in the lower right. I can't read far enough ahead to figure out how big a threat that group is facing, but I thought I might have trouble connecting to the stones at R10. Eventually I played R2, which made me feel a lot better, but I'm not sure whether it was necessary.]
;W[ic]C[GOS: And white has taken the step in that direction. He further will want to push at M-17, or even M-16 if his strategy fits it. Before this happens, black will want to push back at M-17. However...]

(;B[gq]C[GOS: We see that you played here. Since you did have that wall in place and it was floating, this was good under the circumstances. With the presence of the wal, though, you may have playes a bit too tight. F-3 might have been better. For instance...


Is this OK or should I have played higher, or elsewhere?];W[fq]
C[GOS: and now white occupies F-3...];B[go];W[fp];B[gp];W[ef]
;B[lc]C[GOS: A little late, but good.];W[ke];B[ej]C[GOS: White's putting a lot of pressure on the upper right moyo. He can now push up from the N-9 stone, as well as push in from the L-15 stone. He has severely limited this group's potential by this point in the game. Before white played L-15, it may have been a good point to play K-16, thus branching out (keeping in mind the stone at N-9), and limiting white's framework. 
White can also now aim for the "bomb" around Q-12 or so, threatening the lower part of your right group.
I think you played where you did to move out in the center and limit white's potential. What needs attention now, though, is the invasion, I think...


This stage of the game is probably the hardest for me...];W[pg]
C[GOS: As in here.];B[qg];W[pi];B[pj]C[GOS: This connection was good. "Connect where you can connect", as Kageyama says. (BTW I recommend "Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go"). If you played R-12, white simply would have pushed through where you connected, limiting you severely, greatly threatening the R-10 stone, and connecting to his group below.


Did I play this right or should I have done something like R11 instead, to stay connected? I feel like he could have divided these three stones from the upper-right group if he'd pushed at it more.]
;W[qh];B[rg];W[oe];B[me]C[GOS: Here, I think it would have been better to connect your three stones at R-10 to the group above.]

;W[dg];B[ch];W[di];B[dj];W[ei];B[ci];W[cl];B[bl];W[bk];B[ck]
;W[al];B[bj];W[am];B[ak];W[an];B[cm]C[GOS: I don't see his C-8 stone as incredibly instrumental. In fact, it seems to me that this stone was a wasted move on his part since all he really managed to do with it was place a stone at A-6, which is an endgame matter, anyway. However, if you had not played here, he could have connected and made a solid wall. 
I don't think it wouldl be too useful, so you could have tenuki'd (moved elsewhere). Perhaps with this move you could have connected your R-10 stones, or moved to ground your lower-right group. Or maybe try to limit his center influence. Of course, it depends on the potential such moves have vs. his connection's potential.
I don't think he could have saved it, and if he tried, it wouldn't be to save it, but to sacrifice it, most likely in an attempt to split your two groups in the area. But I see little profit from such an approach.


Not sure about this; it might have been wasted. I think I was worried about him ending up with a huge area in the center and wanted to push in somehow, but now I'm not sure.

He ended up abandoning the stone at C8, which surprised me during the game. Could he have saved it, and would it have been worthwhile for him to do so?]
;W[fn];B[dl];W[gn];B[hn];W[dm];B[em];W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[dm]
C[GOS: Here, the connection at F-7 takes much higher importance over the D-7 connection. This leaves a huge weakness behind that white could easily exploit to break into the center...]

(;W[cp]C[GOS: As in the alternation here.];B[qr]C[GOS: Well, as mentioned earlier, there have been a few points at which you could have secured this group. As I just mentioned on the previous move, the connection at F-7 is very important, as we find anyway in the next move.
I'm not the best at counting, but I'd say it's atleast around 8 or 9 points. In this situation, you would have to weigh the points here (and life of the group), Vs. the potential damage white can do with the cut at F-7.

Here's that move I mentioned earlier. I know it's worth some points, but I don't know how many. Is it appropriate for this stage of the game, or should I have played it earlier (or later)?]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gl];B[hm];W[fk];B[ek];W[fj]C[GOS: Now white has furthered his wall's reach facing the center in a good way. We can start to see the usefulness of   F-7.]

(;B[or]C[GOS: I would like to point out the potential of O-2...]
;W[nr];B[os];W[ns];B[oq];W[op];B[oo];W[np];B[on];W[nn];B[lm]
;W[jj];B[jl];W[mn];B[rh]TR[oj][pj][qj]C[GOS: I addressed this earlier. :) At this point, it becomes better with white's influence in the center.

I had been worried for some time about these three stones. I thought maybe he could cut them off from both corners and he'd end up with a sizeable area in there. Is this move worthwhile, or is it superfluous?]
;W[qi];B[ri];W[nm];B[pf];W[of];B[og]TR[pg][qh][pi][qi]C[I had hoped to catch this group here but he saw what I was up to. :) So then I just tried to push into the center and reduce his territory there.]
;W[oh];B[ph];W[oi];B[ng];W[pg]
(;B[pe]C[GOS: Instead of here...];W[mg];B[nf];W[lf];B[ne];W[ph]
C[GOS: White's shape here is bulky... (see next move's variation)]

(;B[ik];W[ln];B[kn];W[ij];B[gk];W[gj];B[hl];W[hj];B[hk];W[nh]
;B[ia];W[ha];B[ja];W[mj];B[ml]C[GOS: When asking if it was worth it, you must consider the worth of alternative moves that may or may not be more profitable or important. In this case, the bottom of the board is an active battlefield that can be answered in sente. I see that there, or an approach at S-7, threatening to connect, are worth much more.

This move was an attempt to divide his lower-right group from the stones above it, but he was able to counter it. Was it even worth trying?]
;W[ll];B[kl];W[nl];B[lk];W[nk];B[lj];W[li];B[jd];W[mm];B[id]
C[GOS: No, you were very correct in turning here. it opens many wekanesses for white. And even if he did take at M-8, you could connect and go for ko to save the two stones above it. White shouldn't have let you move here. ;)


Was I wrong to leave M8 open? I couldn't tell how badly it would hurt me if he managed to push through. He did try something there eventually but didn't push very hard, so the question went unanswered.]
;W[hc];B[hd];W[gd];B[he];W[ll];B[hb]C[GOS: This is a very good ko threat in this situation. It's worth atleast 9 or so points, vs what you would have lost in the ko (and it would have been hard to lose it all). F-5 would be good, also, though I think your threat was better.

HOWEVER, I would have ignored the ko altogether and pushed at J-14, thus breaking his center wide open.

Again, I couldn't figure out if that ko was something to worry about or not. I think now that it probably wasn't a big deal, but I was under time pressure here and freaking out a bit. Is this play all right as a ko threat though, or should I have played something like F5 instead?]

;W[bf];B[af]C[GOS: Good reading! Yes, that variotion is correct. Tsumego is very important. ;) 

I thought when he cut me here that I'd overlooked something big, that he could break me apart at B12, but then I realized that I could defend it as shown in the variation. Is this right?]

(;W[ki]
(;B[mr]C[GOS: I know how you feel about time pressure. It can be so frustrating at times, can't it? Anyway, N-2 is worth a few more points than E-2 from my reading. Of course, it depends upon how your opponent reacts. 
As for timing, there have been several opportunities in this game, such as the one I mentioned earlier with respect to this area.
(ignore my E-2. I made a slight mistake in reading and don't hsve time to redo this entire file. ;P )

I was so surprised by B14 that I completely forgot that he'd done that instead of defending at E2, and that he neglected to do so afterwards. I ended up getting in there anyway, but when I realized it was there, I was surprised that I'd missed it. Time pressure, I guess.

That said, I was also a bit surprised that it had taken us so long to settle the boundaries of my big group in the bottom center. How big is this move compared to one at E2? Should we have resolved this boundary earlier?]

;W[dr];B[ds];W[cs];B[es];W[cq];B[eq];W[dq];B[ep];W[pk]C[GOS: Pretty sure he didn't realize. Or maybe he really didn't care seeing how he's losing by about 60 or so points.

I don't know whether he just didn't realize that his group was in atari here or didn't care...]
