AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[Hello, dear reviewer, many thanks in advance for giving away your knowledge!

This game was played two years ago on IGS and meanwhile, I 've met the opponent personaly; he is known for strong and serious playing.

We played several games, half of them with a close result.

Hi, I'm shmolex and I'll be your reviewer today.  I'll prefix all my comments with an S.

To start, off I'm going to say that if this game is 2 years old, you probably wont get much out of this review as you should have improved since then, so most of what I say now should already be apparent to you.  

anyway, on to the review.];W[qn];B[mq];W[fq];B[cm];W[nc];B[nd]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[lc];B[pb]LB[pf:A]C[I know, that is not  Joseki, better A

S:.  A is much better.  Q18 does little for black.];W[lf]LB[pf:A]
C[after W(M14) S must play A.

S: couldn't agree more];B[nj]C[S: I'm not sure what you're trying to do with this move.  If you're trying to pressure white, r8 would be better.  If you're trying to take territory in the top right, you need to fix q14 first.]
;W[qj];B[qk];W[rk];B[qi];W[rj]
(;B[qh]LB[qh:A][pk:B]C[S:  Defenitely needs to be p9.  r12 is weak. and leaves cutting points.]
;W[pk]
(;B[pn]LB[qp:A]C[S: Should play p9 immediately to prevent white from playing p10 .  It also keeps white from breaking into the center.]
;W[pm];B[qo];W[on];B[po];W[om];B[mg];W[rn];B[ro]C[S: much too slow at this point.  There are much bigger points on the board, such as H3.]

(;B[ee]C[S: no need to be so agressive.  White is already in a tough spot here.  Better to connect through e17.]

(;B[kc]LB[kc:A][eg:B]C[S: A does nothing but help fix white's shape.  You can choose B to capture the white stones on the left, but in the process, the black stones on top will be lost.  I would opt for a move like h13 to try and save something at the top.]
;W[kb];B[le];W[me];B[fo]C[S: h13 is urgent if you want to save something.]

C[S: c3 is worth more.];W[cq];B[cp];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[fp]
C[S: No need to play this move.  H13 or n6 is big.];W[gh]C[S: too late]

[qs][rs][ss]C[S: close game, and white won it in the endgame.  I suggest reading up on monkey jumps and how to properly defend against them.  Your biggest mistake was not playing e17.  Starting a fight in a 9 handicap game is almost never good for black.  Play conservatively and take the safer route.  White needs to kill something to win a 9 stone game, so dont give him that opportunity.]
