C[(0) Thhh:  Hi!
(0) -> hello and good game!

Mans - Hi Douglas, I will try to do the review to the best of my knowledge. I am a bit rusty, since I haven't played in a while.]
;B[pd];W[cp];B[qp];W[dd];B[eq];W[dr]C[What is that?? What is the best way to deal with it? Maybe my alt path?

Mans - see my variations for some comments]
(;B[hq]LB[hq:A][er:B]C[Mans - I don't like your response. You are opening up for him to attack underneatch at E2 or F2 or attack on the other side at K2]
;W[dq];B[dp]C[Mans - I don't like this move. You are vulnerable again and giving him opportunity to build strength and territory]
;W[do];B[ep];W[dn]C[Mans - after this move he has a strong territory on fourth line and you have agroup of stones hanging in the middle. He can still attack on F2 or K2 or K3]

(;B[oq]C[Mans - I think you want to safe up the bottom part of the board by this, but it is actually still open for attacks. and it is a bit overcrowded on the bottom side after that move. Look at my variation.]
;W[qj];B[ql];W[qg];B[qe]C[Is there a better move here? Maybe 16R? or even14R?

Mans - This move is perfectly fine. R16 works, but puts no pressure on him. R14 does not really work. Now you have him neatly fined and can put a lot of pressure on his R13 and R10 group]
;W[re];B[rd];W[rf]
(;B[jd]C[To far? To high?

Mans - maybe a bit wild. You are not really defending the upper right corner with that move. If that is your goal, it is too far and too high. He can attack the corner with a number of moves. But you don't have to defend the upper right corner, so it works.]
;W[hd];B[cf]C[Maybe k14 first then f17 or what?

Mans - I think this works, but you have to be careful about having too many loose and vulnerable stones on the board. Especially if you are not confident you can defend them correctly. Maybe focus on building more safe territory]
;W[be]C[There is that funny corner move again!

Mans - as you can see he is building terrirory in this corner safely while pushing your lonely stones. I guess your next move came out of desperation to make sure it didn't develop the same way as the other corner. Look at my simple variation.]

(;B[di];W[bf]C[Mans - atfer this move your stone have nothing. No base along the edge and open to attack from C8]
;B[ce];W[cd];B[cg]C[was there something better?

Mans - seriously you have almost lost the game after this exchange. C13 was probably needed, but as you can see, he has secured a very large are in the top left corner, and you have a lot of stones hanging in the middle that doesn't give you any territory. and it is his move to do anything he likes now.  A move like attacking and building with C9 like he did]
;W[ck];B[cj];W[dk]
(;B[jf]C[Mans - this move is pushing him towards attacking your still unsecure big group around the left side, which he does. Don't push him towards your weak stones. As a general rule in go you only push opponents towards your strong groups. See my variation.]
;W[bg]C[yes and now watch me loose the whole side!!];B[bh];W[bi]
;B[ch];W[bj];B[fe];W[fd];B[ee];W[ed]
(;B[eg]C[Mans - this stone is not neccessary. It is too protective.]
;W[ge];B[gf];W[de];B[df];W[ah];B[he];W[gd]C[and loose the corner too! 2 winds yikes!]
;B[ie];W[hf];B[gg];W[hg];B[hh];W[ig];B[jh];W[gh];B[fg];W[ih]
;B[hi];W[ii]
(;B[gi]C[Mans - I think this is too passive, even though I like the fact that you are now safe. See variation]
;W[ci];B[dj];W[ej];B[ei];W[ek]
(;B[kp]C[Mans - I sort of see what you are trying to do here, at least secure some territory so he won't invade this as well. However, if you look at the whole board you notice that you are already in trouble. He has secured a lot of territory and has no huge vulnerable situations, but you have. So it will be tough to recover. But if you really want to, you need to attack his last weaknesses and build safe territory while doing so. See variation.]
;W[er]C[Mans - here you are lucky white doesn't go for F2.]
;B[fr];W[fo];B[fq]C[Mans - This is too defensive. You get caught defending stones that does not build territory and he keeps attacking you. This gave white the time to play his next move which defends his stomnes in the middle of the board.]
;W[ij];B[jg];W[gj]C[At least the shape lives.];B[hj];W[hk];B[fi]
;W[ik]
(;B[ho]C[Mans - this is too slow. See variation.];W[jc]C[Hey, I wanted to go there!

Mans - yes, he keeps pushing and you keep defending. You need to find moves that both attack his weaknesses and strengthen your own weaknesses.]
;B[kc];W[ic];B[kd];W[hn];B[in];W[go];B[io];W[hm];B[gk]C[Mans - this move is too small. If you want to win you have to think big :) Build a huge territory in the top right or bottom right.]
;W[fj];B[og];W[pf]C[Yet down goes then next corner! :-(];B[of]
;W[pe];B[oe];W[od]
(;B[qd]LB[pc:B][qd:A];W[oc];B[pg];W[qf]
(;B[kb]C[Mans - this is your mistake. You need to defend you top right corner. See variation]
;W[qb]C[Mans - after this move you are dead in the corner and he definitely won the game]
;B[ob]C[Mans, this is not the move. The corner is his. Just go with O16 or Q11]
;W[pc];B[nc];W[nd];B[mc];W[rc];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri]
(;B[rk]C[Mans - this is  forcing him to make the Q10 move which is bad for you, since you need to defend the R12/R11 stones.]
;W[pj];B[ph];W[rj];B[oj];W[jb];B[me];W[ne];B[nf];W[md];B[ld]
;W[mf];B[le];W[mg]
(;B[mh]C[Mans - this move is not the one to make. It lead to you losing the whole group. See variation]
;W[lh];B[lg];W[nh];B[mi];W[pi];B[lf];W[ng];B[pb];W[qc];B[oi]
C[That p14 group had no right to die! What went wrong?];W[oh]
;B[pk];W[qk];B[ol];W[rl];B[qm]C[Mans - this is too passive, should be S7]
;W[rm];B[rn];W[sk]
(;B[li]C[Mans - this is too small. If you want that white stone a move at L10 would have the same effect. But your last chance to win the game is to build a huge bottom right corner. See variation]
;W[nk];B[ni]C[Mans - this is not needed. P9 is the move];W[ok]
;B[pl];W[nl];B[qn];W[kk]
(;B[im]C[Mans - this is not the move either. You can stop him from connecting. See variation]

;W[ln];B[jo];W[lo];B[lp];W[km];B[jm];W[jl];B[ji];W[jj];B[mk]
;W[ml]C[Game over but I think the fighting went ok to the end.

Mans - Yes I agree. He has too much territory so you can't win now. I will give less advice going forward, basically only comment on pure errors.]

[sr][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[Mans - I agree that you made better moves than him during the end game. It might be because he knew he was ahead so he relaxed a bit, I don't know. In general I think you have to focus your early moves on "dual purpose" moves. You moves early on should be both attacking and building some safe territory at the same time. You do not have time to do pure attack moves or pure defensive moves early on.

I really enjoyed doing the review and watch your game. I improved my own game by looking at it. Keep up the good work.

Now you go for the kill of the white group in the middle :) Even if you fail to kill it, you can build a wall to a large territory either above or below the middle line. See  example]

;B[bk];W[bl];B[rk];W[rj];B[ic];W[hc];B[ib];W[hb];B[ol]C[Mans - this is just one example of how you can secure some of your loose areas by pushing him to defend his open holes and securing some nice territory with P8]
