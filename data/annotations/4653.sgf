C[Hello Leslie, I tried to answer your answer as well as I could. If you don't understand anything fell free to ask at arnaudboucherie@hotmail.com

I started my my commentaries with AB.];B[pd];B[pp];B[dd];B[dp]
C[first 4 stones are handicap];W[nc];B[nd];W[md];B[ne];W[oc]
;B[pc];W[lc]C[Is this shpae good for white or black?Why?

AB: I think it's good for both. Starting with B O16 is ok in a 4 handicap stones.
M17 can be played at K17. M17 makes the P16 P15 Q15 sequence effective, so white must protect at Q14. If white plays at K17 the cut does not work so blakc can play around Q10. Both M17 and K17 are playable for white in this game.]
;B[pf]C[AB: good];W[jd]C[AB: This is too slow, especially in handicap game. White already played M17 which makes him thick. I would approach at F17 instead.]
;B[dj];W[gd]C[AB: Too slow.];B[fc]C[Is this move correct?

AB: I think so. White feels forced to defend because otherwise he would lose most of what he has built so far with no good compensation. Also he you tenuki black can start troubles by playing at C14.]
;W[gc];B[fd];W[fe];B[ee]C[AB: White should not push because black will make 5th line territory and White can't hope to make much points in the center.]
;W[ff];B[eg]C[I sthis move correct

AB: Locally yes. But playing at K4 would be much bigger.];W[ef]
;B[df];W[dg];B[fg]C[Who is better now

AB: Of course black is leading. White still has only played on one side and gave too much territorry.]
;W[ge];B[dh];W[gg];B[cg];W[fh];B[eh]C[AB: Small];W[fb];B[eb]
C[IS this move the best

AB: Yes it's the best move to defend here.];W[ga];B[ea];W[fi]
;B[ei]C[AB: worth one point];W[fj];B[ej]C[AB: same here. If you play around Q10 the white wall will be almost useless.]
;W[ek];B[dk];W[em];B[el]C[AB: All those moves are too slow for white and black.]
;W[fl];B[fk];W[gk];B[ek]C[AB: Black can cut, he has nothing to lose in the ko, white the white wall can crumble.]
;W[gm]C[Iswhite in a good shape?

AB: G8 is probably better. Here the kikashi are painful and white can handle a cut at F7.]
;B[dm];W[en];B[dn];W[do];B[eo]C[I s this the best move?

AB: C5 is better, it keeps things simple and black is leading.]
;W[co];B[cn]C[AB: Play from the weaker side. C4 kills white.]
;W[ep];B[fo];W[cp];B[dq];W[eq];B[cq];W[bq];B[bp]C[AB: Does not work and strenghtens white, should definitly not be played. B2 is correct.]
;W[bo];B[bn];W[ap];B[am]C[AB: Odd move. White must connect at A5 and you lose 1 or 2 points compared with the descent at A6.]
;W[qn]C[AB: The ko at A5 is worth more than 30 points and white can't really win it so connecting at A5 is a necessary.]
;B[ql]C[AB: must play the ko.];W[qq];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[rp]
;B[ro];W[rq];B[qo];W[nq]C[Is this joseki used well

AB: The direction is correct and with the strong position in the upper right corner black can have some prospects here.]
;B[oq];W[or]C[AB: Damezumari and does not work. This kind of moves should not be played.]
;B[pn];W[np];B[no];W[jp]C[Is this the right distance?

AB: If black plays the ko he leads by a lot so white must have ambitin. Hence K4 looks right.]
;B[mp]C[AB: In the following sequence white gained too much territory too easily. Black can fight.]
;W[mq];B[lo];W[lp];B[mo];W[kp];B[ko];W[io];B[jn];W[in]C[I sthis the best move?

AB: M14 is a very good move for both, so it should be played instead of J6.]
;B[im];W[hm];B[km]C[AB: K7 is better.];W[il];B[jm]C[Is black in a good shape?

AB: No. If we change oder, it's like you played K7 J8 L7 and L7 would be odd in answer to J8.]
;W[jk];B[kl]C[AB: M14];W[kj];B[kk];W[jj];B[lj];W[li];B[mj];W[mi]
;B[ph];W[nh];B[nj];W[ni];B[oi]C[Who is better now?

AB: Black if he takes the ko at A5, white otherwise.];W[ng]
