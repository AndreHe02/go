C[Hello Zaphod,

I'm your reviewer Xinwen. I hope my reviews can help you improve your perspective in go.]

;B[qh];W[qn]LB[ql:A]C[this feels like an overplay, but is it?

Xinwen::::

I would play A for black for standard joseki sequence]
(;B[co]LB[nq:A]C[Xinwen:::

White would probably like to pincer at A to speed things up]
(;W[cm]LB[eo:C][ep:B][jq:A]C[Xinwen:::

It seems like you having hard time to choose a joseki. I would probably try A for Black. 

If Black chooses the B or C joseki here, may seems bit complex.]
(;B[ck]C[dubious?];W[do];B[cn];W[dn];B[bm]LB[cp:A]C[Xinwen:::

White playing at A probably the best shape.]
(;W[dm]LB[bo:A]C[Xinwen:::

Playing at A for black covers everything.]
(;B[bp]C[revealing my blind spot, negating the whole point of c9 and c6]
;W[bl]C[of course :(];B[bn]C[painful];W[cl];B[cq]LB[mp:B][dr:A]
C[weak? or necessary?

Xinwen:::

White playing A next is sente

I'm not so sure but, i would probably want to try pincer at B for White, looks interesting]
(;W[np]LB[no:B]C[aggressive.... too aggressive?  its very far from the wall and there's still the weakness at r8

Xinwen:::

Black playing at B pretty interesting.]
(;B[pn]C[i expect you will criticise this];W[pm];B[on];W[qo]
;B[op]LB[nq:B][rq:A]C[Xinwen:::

White's joseki at A is common.

White at B is alternative]
(;W[qp];B[nq]LB[jq:B][kq:A]C[dont know what is joseki here. w seems to be overplaying with r4 (leaving aji at r7), but there's still that wall over on the left...

i was unsure how i would handle a double hane - there isnt time for long reading early on and it would be highly speculative to do so, right?

Xinwen:::

White playing at B or A would be more reasonble.]
(;W[mp]C[Xinwen:::

terrible and heavy shape];B[mq];W[lq];B[lp]LB[kq:A]C[Xinwen:::

White should just play A to reduce losses.]
(;W[lo]C[Xinwen:::

terrible terrible damage, playing at m5 atari is typical kgs habit (save all and kill)]
;B[kp]C[the last few moves seem to have benefited b];W[mn]C[Xinwen:::

terrible result.];B[lr];W[ko];B[jp];W[iq]C[feels like a mistake in direction]
;B[ip]C[thinking about later attacking m5 group, plus erasing the potential of the wall, but perhaps there is a better play? f3 comes to mind...]
;W[hq];B[dr]LB[pr:A]C[Xinwen:::

Looking at the outcome here, i'm sorry to say it just turn-off my interest to this game.

From here, let see what is White's option of attack later on.]
(;W[eq];B[ho];W[jq];B[kq]LB[qf:A]C[Xinwen:::

White should just strike at A, there is no time for hesitation.]
(;W[dk]LB[oc:A]C[Xinwen:::

Black playing at A is more viable than real game's D10 (kgs-oriented).]
(;B[dj]C[Xinwen::

the shape is heavy!]
(;W[cj];B[ci];W[bk];B[om];W[pl]LB[oc:A][jf:B]C[Xinwen::

A is still calling you or even B is asking you to fence up the influence.]
(;B[dh]LB[ef:A]C[xinwen:::

White should just jump, atari at e10 seems pointless.

Jumping at A here, can hope for a bigger prey.]
(;W[ej];B[df];W[cg]LB[jf:B][dg:A]C[Xinwen:::

If you want to run just A to continue and escape.

otherwise just go for B to speed up your pace as you are slowing yourself down.]
(;B[bi];W[dg];B[eh];W[di];B[ch];W[eg];B[fh]LB[gf:A]C[Xinwen:::

You can see the result, it just too ugly and heavy. White should just jump at A.

When you save heavy stones, it just gets heavier and slows which pretty much pointless.]
(;W[fg];B[gh];W[ih];B[gg];W[gf];B[ig]LB[gd:A]C[Xinwen:::

excatly like what you said, White could have sente (testing+preparation) at A before continue to attack. This is what dan usually does.]
(;W[hf]C[standard push and shove by kyu players - surely w could have done something more thoughtful?]
;B[hg];W[jh];B[if];W[hd];B[hc];W[je];B[kg];W[ie];B[ke]LB[kf:A]
C[Xinwen:::

White probably just A, a more direct way]
(;W[jd]C[i lost respect for w seeing this, but is it as clumsy as i think?]
;B[kh];W[kd];B[oc]LB[qf:A]C[Xinwen:::

White should invade at A already!]
(;W[oe]C[and this felt like a teenager move - how to respond?

i didnt want to get into an unoredictable fight and elt i had a lead, so i chose what i thought was the honte move]
;B[pf];W[nc]C[another kyu move - i was feeling this would be an easy game - but was i mistaken?]
;B[nb];W[ob]C[feels like this just helps b];B[pb]C[in hindsight, this looks like a weak move - the standard draw back would be better?]

LB[mb:9][nb:4][ob:5][pb:6][nc:3][pc:8][od:7][oe:1][pf:2]C[its time to attack the m5 stones, but how?

Xinwen:::

the sequence from White 1 to White 9 is a standard joseki to reduce Black's influence to fix the shape. certainly it is not ideal to do this in this situation.]
;B[ng]C[attacking from a distance whilst reinforcing the long eyeless string - but too indirect?]

C[why on earth did i do this?!];W[md];B[of]C[oh no... again!! i must be very timid]
;W[kk]LB[cb:A]C[w gets the first move in the most important area - oh well, soldier on...

Xinwen:::

This is Yose phase (large). Sit back and judge, take a minute to look around.

Black has more land, however A is really important for either player.

(;B[jj]C[ok?];W[ol]LB[cb:A][qq:B]C[Xinwen:::

A and B are really big yose move. starting from A and sente back to B. I can ensure your guarantee in this game.

Tip for Yose, look at the side for sente, center is always harder to surround good amount of lands.]
;B[nl];W[nm]C[looks very silly... is it?];B[mm]C[maybe not the best way to take advantage?]

;W[in]LB[cb:A]C[looks very slow..

Xinwen:::

You can see, how much moves made in centre are just pointless compared to A, and i'm very sure Black is leading provided with A]

Advice:

Shape = Look at the stone/group you are saving, the consequences of saving it will impact the whole game significantly. We have always learned lighter shape, jump lightly.

Judgment for crucial point = it is necesary to look out for critical part which you may want to tenuki.

Yose = kyu tend to shun or feel reluctant to do the homework of it, Yose can makes 10 to 20 points different, trust me.

Fighting = You can fight, but not overplaying the fighting sequence. Fighting to kill is unhealthy.

Overall, this is good game. Most importantly, try to enjoy the game and i know it is very difficult when you are desperately trying to reach dan-world. I can warn you, unless you have fully prepared to face greater misery fate then join us. 

I can ensure you that you will feel the same as what you're feeling now at my level when facing 5-dan or 6-dan.

Cheers
