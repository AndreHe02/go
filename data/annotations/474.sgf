C[Black position in the lower left corner doesn't look good at this point as the two stones are two far apart. Black can probably improve his position by putting preasure on the two white stones above it. See variation]

(;B[ce];W[cd];B[de];W[dd];B[ic];W[jd]C[White G17 looks better. R16 is not really a very affective attack againt the black stone. There is a say in Go: don't attach to lone stones as it makes them stronger. I think that you can say the same about R16 although not an attachment,]
;B[lc]C[B L17 or G17 looks better. M17 is too far and white can cut, as it did.]

Black at J13 is a bad idea. It pushes white to H13 helping him campturing the black group at H18.]

Normally, the 3-3 invasion is better to the player on the outside, although the player in the corner gains 10 points and one side still open for further expansion. Is this case, becasue of white's stone at R6, black is compeltely closed in the corner. This invasion may be good at end of game, if white's expansion options outside of his wall are small.]
