C[ Hello, I'm Tilwen, black in this game. I elt like I got a very nice opening, but then I missed tempo I think and all my influence went to nothing. Could you help me point out my mistakes ? Thanks a lot !
(I put more specific questions in the file)


I think there are three really important places you should think about. 
53 - positional judgment... make the game simple if you can. at 53 you can secure 80 points and then just cruise to victory.

then again with 65 you can secure your points and have a solid 15 point lead.

106 - Use thickness to attack. White had robbed you of your huge territory on the right so you have to use that thickness for something. 106 was your chance to split white and go on the offensive.

Very interesting game. Super messy fighting in the opening, gotta love it. You played very well. One thing I'd say is this. If you are ahead, try to simplify the game. Only when you are behind do you need to complicate the game. In this game you played a good opening so in the middle game you should look for moves that give you a clear victory (53,65,etc)

Good luck,];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[mq];B[jp]C[This game and the previous one I tried a chinese opening back, and here I wanted to try this pincer :) .]

;B[rr];W[rn];B[rq];W[op];B[pr];W[nq]C[White has two cuts now.]
;B[fq];W[hq]C[CC: seems like an overplay]
(;B[no]LB[qk:D][no:C][jp:B][fq:A]C[CC: Maybe better to respond to his invasion first... that will help you build strength and make attacking here easier.

your stones are all very separated which makes the situation very risky... with all these weaknesses who knows what will happen. 

its a fine move though, white has his hands full too. just a matter of keeping the game in hand.

extending is better, it leaves a very usful peep at 

see var];W[lo]
(;B[np]C[Maybe this cut is too greedy ? I made some points but white got influence ...

yes the result was ok because you got points... but you could have gotten better especially if you extend on 27]

(;W[pm]C[CC: this was wrong shape for white. he can do much better]
;B[om];W[ol];B[nl];W[mm];B[pl];W[ok];B[pn]C[I felt after playing this that R7 was best. I expected white to capture with M6 for instance, getting a nice moyo on the lower side, but my right side is OK too I guess.]

(;W[fp]C[He solidified here. I was thinking the corner was still open, so i cut at O9, thinking if white saves this stones, I have a target.

CC: yes this is wrong for sure fixing shape of wall is necessary]
;B[nk]C[CC:: good idea]
(;W[oj]LB[eq:A]C[bad. white should think about playing A];B[nj]
;W[oi];B[ni];W[ln]C[And he did !

CC: well played];B[oh]C[Up to here, I was very confident aboutt he game, maybe too much.


CC: up to here black looks much better than white. so far so good]
;W[gq]LB[eq:A]C[A better];B[fc]LB[oc:A][pc:B]C[CC: You can think about A or B to just make some 80 points of solid territory... white will have trouble keeping up.]

C[CC: white play is not great - your last move helps reduce white potential in the bottom left]
;W[qf]TR[db][dc][hc][dd]SQ[mc][nc][nd]C[Again, I'm quite happy with the result. R14 started the troubles for me, could you help me see what I did wrong strategically ?

Your next move was wrong. This is about direction of play and positional judment. white triangle group makes the top side boring, black will not make many point on that side so playing in square area isn't great.]

You should try to keep playing ko... because you are behind without it. game is already getting away from you. you have some good ko threats in the top right.]
