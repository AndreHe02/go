C[Hi and thank you for reviewing this game. I played white in this game. I think I could've done a better job attacking in this game, but I am not sure what would be the best way to do so. Some comments pointing out the missed oppotunities would be really helpful. Thank you!

Hi, I'm Tsinghua, and I'll be commenting on your game. 

This game was very messy, and a lot of the problems could have been solved with simple moves. Both of you seemed to want to kill everything, and it hurt you both.

If you want advice about attacking, I would need another game to be honest, because after move 35 you never got a chance to attack.

I hope you find my comments useful, and if you have any questions I'll be more than happy to give an answer by e-mail.]

;W[qo];B[qm];W[qq];B[qr];W[pp];B[rq];W[oq];B[pr];W[oo]C[I knew the usual continuation for black was to take the r3 stone. Is this the best way to respond to q2?

I actually don't know, but I'm sure this will suffice. If I had to choose, I would probably play p4 though.]
;B[fq];W[cn]LB[rp:B][hq:A]C[I prefer the pincer at 'a' as B might get interesting later.]
;B[kq];W[or];B[rp];W[ro];B[qp];W[qj]TR[fq][kq]C[Is this what I should've played here? or should I play somewhere else?

I think black is over-extended with the marked stones. I would prefer attacking them.]

You follow up is very stressed. You should worry about your lower right group.]
