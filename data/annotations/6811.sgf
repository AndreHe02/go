C[Hello,

My screen name is elconde, and I'll be reviewing your game.

Some general points I'd like to make before getting into the game:

Don't worry so much about attacks in the beginning of the game.  The opening is about declaring territory not invading or defending it.

You don't have to respond to every one of your opponents moves.  If you find yourself just responding to your opponent's moves instead of making your own moves it's time to take a step back and look around the board for other opportunities.

I think you are clearly a better player, but you made a few mistakes any one of which made the game for your opponent.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[pd];W[cp];B[oj];W[nc];B[ne]LB[jc:B][kc:A]C[here i was actually a bit suprised by his move. but thinking again this move is perfectly fine so i should not have been surprised.

You threatened his corner so he pulled back in defense.  Reasonable.  At this point I would have pulled back to the middle myself.  A or B for example.]
;W[pb]LB[ld:A]C[here i'm not sure if getting in was the good thing to do or if i should have played at A

Now you've made a direct threat against his corner.  It gets you maybe 12 points.  However it gives black the opportunity to pull back further into the center giving him good influence there.  That's probably worth more than 12 points.]
;B[oc];W[kc]LB[nd:A]C[was it a good thing to expend to the middle here? it seemed ok because it reminded me of the joseki. but maybe i should have played at A

This move would have been nice earlier, but now you have no choice but to defend your stone in the corner.]
;B[ob]C[That should have been your move.];W[nb];B[oa]TR[pb]
C[here i was sure i lost the marked stone. maybe i should have tried to fight for it early on...

Yes, black forced you to fight for it.];W[nd]C[This move gives you no territory at all.  At this point too much emphasis is being made on attacks.  There is still plenty of space around the sides and corners of the board.  A move at F3, for example, would give you at least 15 points!]
;B[od];W[nq]C[maybe i was suppose to reinforce more at the upper right but it bugged me to leave so much empty territory unoccupied

It would bug me too.  I think this move is reasonable.];B[pc]
C[Black makes moves like these that convince me that you're the better player.]
;W[pn]C[pincer];B[qc]C[Another bad move by black.];W[no]LB[jq:A]
[kq:B]C[this was supposed to be a blocking move. it showed its value later i think.

What's there to block?  Two stones in the corner is plenty for now.  Extending to the side with A or B would give you at least 10 points of territory in the bottom.]
;B[qo];W[kq];B[po];W[oo];B[pq];W[om];B[pr];W[dj]C[here i tought - jeez he lives so much territory unoccupied...

Make more moves like this early on.];B[mh];W[dg]LB[nk:A][pk:B]
C[was this the right thing to do at the moment?
maybe i should have played A or B

Try to count the number of points it would give you.  The move you made gives you influence over 15 points of territory at least.  B gives you maybe 8 if black doesn't push up from the corner.  A gives some influence in the middle, but it's tenuous.]
;B[md]C[the thing from before that i didn't reinforce the upper right...

But you certainly didn't lose any stones.  Your territory here is secure, but it's small.]
;W[lc];B[mc];W[mb];B[na];W[lb];B[ma];W[me];B[ld]C[Always trace the ladder with you finger on the board to make sure it's really yours.  Your stone on N15 will be in atari on black's next move.

Try the variation I laid out.]
(;W[kd];B[le];W[lf]LB[mf:A]TR[me]C[here i was so darn busy being happy about my ladder that i didn't notice that!
here i probably should have played A!];B[mf];W[ke];B[me];W[kg]
LB[kf:B][lg:A]C[i don't know if this was a good spot to use the tiger mouth because of black A later.
but it did gave me some more middle territory than if i just played B.

Yes, but there's so much more territory left at the bottom!  Here you didn't have a choice, but keep that in mind.]
;B[lg];W[kf];B[kh];W[jh];B[ki];W[qj]LB[ji:A]C[did A was better?
i think this moved showed value later.

You could have moved at A, and your opponent would have still kept pushing into the middle.  This is a good move to steal some territory that is still up for grabs on the right side.  However, it's a bit too aggresive and difficult to defend as you found out.]
;B[pk]C[black respoded where i should have responded earlier,,,]
;W[pl];B[ol];W[qk];B[ql];W[pm];B[pj];W[qi];B[qm];W[qn];B[rm]
;W[rn];B[nm];W[on]TR[ql][qm][rm]C[this moved seemed the right one to do as i wasn't sure yet that i'll win the race capturing the 3 black stone.

Count the liberties.  The black group has two, and your group has three.  Moreover, black can't move at P6 before moving at O6, so you'll have some warning.]
;B[nk];W[fc]C[This move should have been made ages ago!];B[ji]
;W[ii]LB[ih:A]C[was A better?
i don't think so cause it could have drive that spike to my territory.

Yes.  In general three stones in a diagonal is a very weak formation.]
;B[ih];W[jg];B[ij];W[hi];B[hg]C[here he saw the net i prepared... pitty.]
;W[hj]LB[gh:B][gj:A]C[was A better? closing at B later?

What about pushing in from R11?  How about the territory in the lower left?]
;B[ik];W[hl]LB[hk:A]C[the jump here was good i think. better than just closing at A]
;B[il];W[im];B[jl];W[hn];B[jm];W[jn];B[kn];W[ko];B[ln];W[jp]
C[was i playing too open? it looked safe to me but apperently it wasn't.

It's a reasonable move if you're afraid of losing K6.];B[lo]
;W[lp];B[mp];W[mo];B[lq];W[kp]C[That was a ko.  No need to fill it yet.]
;B[mq];W[np];B[mr];W[nr];B[kr]C[Why respond to black's moves when you can make him respond to yours?  See the variation.]

(;W[jr];B[js];W[is];B[ks];W[ns]LB[ir:A][ns:B]C[should have played at A probably but then he could have played at my place (B). was it a good call?

Neither.  Black's formation is so weak, go for N1.];B[ir];W[hs]
LB[hr:A]TR[jr]C[i don't know if this was a good move. couldn't think of anything better.
playing at A might have been better. letting him to take the marked stone but building wall to the right.

Playing at the bottom is almost never a good move.  His pyramid formation is still there for the taking.  Take that and the rest will follow.]
;B[hr];W[gr];B[jq];W[gs];B[gq];W[fr];B[fq];W[er];B[ip];W[eq]
LB[jo:A]C[stupid me. should have seen it and play at A];B[jo]
;W[fo]TR[hn][eq]C[this looked like a good spot to close with two knight moves from the marked stones.]
;B[in];W[gp]LB[hm:A]C[i gusse again i made the same mistake and should have closed at A, strenghtening my wall.]
;B[ep];W[fp];B[dq];W[hq]C[it came out ok toughe...];B[hm]C[here i really hoped he wouldn't see it...]
;W[gm];B[im];W[ho];B[hp];W[gq]C[this was aimed at building a group with 2 eyes.]
;B[io]C[can't see the point of his move as this is a dame point...]
;W[gn];B[hk]C[what i'v been afraid off. probably should have played there earlier...]
;W[gl];B[gk];W[fk];B[gj];W[gi];B[fj];W[fi];B[ej];W[ek]LB[ei:A]
TR[hg][ih]C[should i have played at A?
didn't want to let him go to the bottom but thinking again the marked stone are problematic also...

Continue extending those stones as they're in jeapordy!];B[ei]
;W[eh]LB[fh:A]C[seeing what happaned next i guess i should have played A.]
;B[fh]TR[fi][gi][hi][ii][hj]C[my stones are dead... was there a way to save them?

Not anymore.];W[gh]LB[fg:A]C[tried to save but only made it worse. should have played A to block and connect.]
;B[fg];W[di];B[gg]C[i was already dead so this move was pointless isn't it?

Yep.];W[eg];B[hh];W[sn]C[i was really afraid he'll play there from earlly on. couldn't find a good time to play there...

Are you worried about the three stones surviving?  They only have two liberties, and this move doesn't change that.]
;B[pi];W[ph]C[wanted to envade the right side. he left it unguarded and it looked like a good opprotunity.


This should have been done long ago before black managed to take most of the center territory.]
;B[oh]LB[qg:B][qh:A]C[if he played at A could it be a problem for me?
i tought that if he playes A i'll play B so i'll be ok.

Not a problem that I can see.];W[qh];B[pg];W[qg];B[pf];W[rl]
C[i guess his stones where already dead but i felt i should take security measurements.

Trust your intuition and make a more meaningful move like R14.]
;B[qf];W[rf]LB[rg:A]C[it was clear i'll have to play A later but it helped me to lower his territory.]
;B[re];W[sf];B[se];W[rg];B[ro]C[here i was sure that if he closes i can't kill the group and he'll have 12 points of territory and my nice walls would be a waste.

His extending to the wall has no relevance whatsoever.  You need to lookout for the eyes.  "Two eyes you live one eye you die."]
;W[so]C[so i closed. i think this was the best move i could make at the moment.]
;B[sp];W[rp];B[rq];W[sq];B[qp]C[i was determined to make sure he can't make eyes there.]
;W[sp];B[rr];W[sr];B[rs];W[la]C[closed the hole to be quite.

This is more of an endgame move.  There's still the big chunk at F14 going right that you need to take.]
;B[qr]C[if he takes Q1 he makes 2 eyes so it was dangerus. i'm glad i didn't miss that.]
;W[ps];B[qs]C[this move was pointless i guesse. the group was already mine. or was there a way to save it?

It is a pointless move for black.];W[os]LB[or:A]TR[ps]C[should i have played this move? even if he took the marked stone i could just play A.

Trust your instinct.  This move got you nothing.];B[ms];W[hf]
C[i wanted to make sure i can guard my upper territory.

Good, but touching a group of stones with one lonely stone is dangerous.]
;B[mn];W[ff];B[gf];W[ge];B[fe];W[ef];B[he]TR[ff]C[again, i have a weakness for double atati. maybe i should have played there and let him take the marked stone. this move eventually made me lose the upper territory.

You should have never touched his group with the lonely stone.  Moving at F14 then going right would have been safer.]
;W[gd];B[if];W[ed]C[making sure he can't escape with the net. was it a good move?

How could one lonely stone push through your formation?  Worry more about your group at L17.  This move lost you the game.]
;B[hd];W[gc];B[hc];W[hb];B[ib];W[ga];B[ia];W[ha]C[later it came to me that i just lost a huge group of stones by helping him build that wall...]
;B[ic];W[rc]C[at this point i don't know why but i had to play and see if i can get some of that corner. probably it was a pointless suicide.

No such thing.  The endgame is a good time for trying things out.  Especially since we're not professionals there are a lot of moves we need to figure out by trial and error.  And since we're pretty much at the endgame now, these moves don't really lose you points unless your opponent passes.]
;B[rd];W[qb];B[rb];W[tt]C[here i passed cause i couldn't see a way to improve my territory. it was stupid but i didn't think he would invade although there is lots of space inside my left side.]
;B[bm]C[Black is pulling at straws.  It's very dangerous to touch a stone, so try a more defensive approach.  See the variation.]

(;W[cm]C[i can't point what was the best way to attack his stone.]
;B[bn];W[cn];B[bo];W[co];B[bp];W[cq];B[bq];W[dr];B[br];W[dp]
;B[bs]C[You can see how touching the stone doesn't really help.]
;W[bl];B[al];W[ak]C[Three stones in a diagonal is very dangerous.  See the variation.]

(;B[am];W[bk];B[cs];W[ao]C[for some reason i thought i can prevent him from making eyes by playing there. i guess with group this big its pointless... is it?

Yep.];B[ap];W[ds]C[wanted to keep some of my territory there.]
;B[bc]C[again, invading my territory.

Again, don't touch his stone.]
(;W[bd];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[cb]C[That's way to deep to be able to protect that stone.]
;B[db];W[eb];B[da]C[here i saw that again,  i lost a corner. i need to work about fighting corners.

You haven't lost it yet.  See the variation.  Also check out goproblems.com which has a lot of practice trials that will help with this.]

(;W[ad];B[ac];W[ea];B[bb];W[bg]C[here i wanted to make sure i have some protection. i was afraid of losing this spot too.]
