C[[Calvin\] Thank you for using Go Teaching Ladder.  Remember that I am also a weak player and there are many things that I may miss.

I think white lost this game because white 34 and 48 are overplays, which left white with a thin position that was easy for black do exploit withuot doing anything special.]

(;W[pk]C[My thinking here is that if he plays to enclose me instead, I have a chance to invade and create a weak group for him

[Calvin\] To me, cutting at R9 for black would be the only move.  As white the shape move at Q12 is fine.  See variation.]

(;B[ni]C[[Calvin\] Black misses the vital point at Q12.];W[nj]
SQ[ni][pi][pj]C[I felt like this would hurt his shape more than pushing at O9 or jumping to N9. He also has to somehow guard the cut at P11

[Calvin} This is tesuji, preventing the bamboo joint.  Good job finding it!]

(;B[oh]C[[Calvin\] An odd shape.  Q12 is still better, I think.]

(;W[og]C[[Calvin\] Q12 is sente and still a good move.  This allows black the wedge at Q13.  See variation.]

(;B[ng]C[[Calvin\] This is too soft on white.  See variation.]
;W[ph];B[oi]
(;W[mi]C[[Calvin\] This leaves a cutting point and gives black a free atari at P14.]
;B[of]C[I wasn't sure what the right move was here. I considered a KO at q14 but wasn't sure what that would get me. I really wanted a chance to play s15 to make my base more solid so that I could not worry about this group.]
;W[pg];B[pf];W[re];B[rd];W[qe];B[pe]
(;W[rh]MA[nf]LB[qf:A]C[[Calvin\] Although this clearly helps white make two eyes, playing at A would as well and would make the threat of a cut at O14 more severe.]

(;B[mh]C[[Calvin\] Black could cut N10 instead.  This move helps white fix.]
;W[li];B[lh];W[qn]LB[mj:A]C[[Calvin\]: I would continue with L11 instead.   Black is pushing from behind and is overconcentrated at the top.  Without another move, white still has a cutting point at A.  This R6 seems like a bit too much.]
;B[pm];W[pn];B[om]
(;W[nl]C[[Calvin\] This move doesn't do enough work and doesn't help the weakest group at Q6.  I feel it's the wrong direction and white needs to protect the P6 stones more directly.]

(;B[nm]C[[Calvin\] O6 instead would be thicker.  White's stones in the middle aren't as easy to attack.   See variation.]
;W[no]C[I'm trying to balance 2 goals of keeping my middle group alive and splitting the weak black stones from the bottom corner. They're getting pretty thick though]
;B[mm];W[ll];B[ml];W[mk];B[lm];W[lo];B[mp]
(;W[jn]C[[Calvin\] What's wrong with just connecting directly at N5?   Can white kill black here?  I don't think so.  To me, it is a big overplay.  Also, if white connects at N5, the exchange of black's peep at N4 for white N5 is not good for black as it strengthens white in an area where black has weak group.  When your opponent offers an easy thank-you move like this, just connect and say "thank you."   Even though this may seem to surround black, white is very, very thin here.  I think this is actually the losing move, as after this black remains ahead for the rest of the game.]

(;B[km]C[[Calvin\] I don't undestand why black doesn't just cut N5, but of course this does create a broken shape in white.]
;W[kl];B[jm];W[hn];B[jl]
(;W[kh];B[kg];W[jh];B[jg];W[ih];B[ig];W[jk];B[ik];W[kj]C[I just wanted to make shape and not worry about this group so I can attack the bottom

[Calvin\] Locally, J10 is better.  The reason is that after black defends at H8, black can atari at K10 and after white connects, black can connect in sente because white will not have two eyes yet.]
;B[hl];W[kq];B[mo]C[[Calvin{ Finally, black finds this.]
(;W[mn]C[I wanted to not let the middle group link up to the corner. But in retrospect this was an overplay. I can't see a variation that successfully separates.

[Calvin\] It's too late for white now to separate.  White needed to connect N5 much earlier.  However, white may be able to do something.   See variation.]
;B[nn];W[ln];B[oo];W[np]C[[Calvin\] White can't get much out of a sacrifice here.]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[mr]TR[kn][lp]C[[Calvin\] Leaving this cutting points is going to cause trouble later.]
;B[nr]C[[Calvin\] Black should play elsewhere.  Answering here is for endgame.]

(;W[rl]C[[Calvin\] I'm not sure what white is trying here.  If white is going to try to make life, it's not easy, but starting at R3 or S4 is better.]
;B[rm];W[rk];B[qm];W[sm];B[rn]
(;W[fm]C[[Calvin\] This move doesn't gain that much because black is completely alive.  Consider the difference between black vs. white playing here.   See variations.]
;B[jc]C[[Calvin\] Black is ahead right now and can play in a lot of places, but I think D15 and C3 are bigger.]
;W[dj]SQ[kn][lp][hg][hh]C[Was f7 and d10 a bad exchange for k17. I chose this rather than take the k17 point because I was worried about his thickness and also felt like I could develop faster without invading.

[Calvin\] I suppose since white is behind trying to build something big in the lower right is a possible way to try to come back.  Note that white has some shape weaknesses at M6 and M4 and whoever gets to play first in the H12 / H13 area gains an advantage.]
;B[ce]C[I didn't know what to do here. I didn't want to give up the corner. And also really didn't want to create a useless white wall facing right. So I attached hoping that the subsequent fighting could create thickness facing down to enclose the left.

[Calvin\] Ah, so you want everything. :)   Attaching will not make white thick on the left.  If you want to emphasize the left, then pincer.  I think I might prefer to kick at C16.]

(;W[de]C[[Calvin\] I definitely think white should kick at C16 instead.  This kind of attachment helps black and the upper side as hard for white to develop because the K17 stone is already there.  On the other hand, white has the D10 stone already which works well with the kick.  See variation.]
;B[cc]LB[df:A][dd:B]C[[Calvin} It's normal for black to hane either at A or B.]

(;W[cf]C[[Calvin\] Rather wedge at C16 and create cutting points.]

(;B[cd]C[[Calvin\] Black should wedge D16 too.];W[bf];B[be]
;W[dd]C[[Calvin\] Locally, good for white.];B[db];W[eb];B[da]
C[[Calvin\] This a common beginner mistake.  Black should connect at C18.  This gives white E19 in sente and black still has to connect inside.]
;W[ea];B[bb];W[gg];B[dq]C[I have gotten into very messy fights that start with e3 or c3 in the past. So I decided to just keep my stones strong and enclose the left.

[Calvin\] It's still good to learn the variations after this attachment.   See variation.]

(;W[cp];B[cq];W[eq];B[er];W[fr]C[Such a basic overplay :(

[Calvin\] It's okay if you intend to take the corner, but there was a mistake in the follow-up.]
;B[fq];W[ep];B[gr]
(;W[gq]C[[Calvin\] D2 is a must at this stage.  See variation.]
;B[fs]C[I think I started panicking here and was worried about him coming up at f4. Perhaps I should have taken h3 to at least keep him low.]

(;W[gp];B[hq];W[ir];B[hr];W[iq];B[hp]C[[Calvin\] Now we'll see why this area was thin for white.]
;W[fp];B[fr];W[ho];B[ip];W[jp];B[io];W[in];B[jo]C[I thought for a while here and concluded I would be cut no. After what. So I started trying to make eyes]

;W[bq];B[br];W[bo]C[[Calvin\] B4 is better.  There is no need to leave the B3 atari for black.]
;B[cr]C[[Calvin\] Black should atari A3 first.]
(;W[ie]C[I wanted to use my wall and also reduce his territory. But this doesn't feel like the best move.

[Calvin\] At this point, black is maybe 20 points ahead.  Playing a normal endgame is not going to be enough.   See variation.]
;B[je];W[ic];B[jb]C[[Calvin\] Black is clearly not taking chances here.  There are more aggressive moves.]
