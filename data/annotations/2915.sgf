Please feel free to comment for black as well.

If you choose to play r13 you black will get an even bigger corner with r15...]

If you compare this with the variation, in the variation black still has to protect at o16 and white gets sente.]

;B[lc]LB[ic:A]C[Trying to make a base

>when you play on the fourth line (k16) it is harder to make a base. Because making a base means to make eye-shape on the side. A Go proverb sais that if you play on the third line you try to live and if you play on the fourth line you try to run out into the center.

As you see, the group still has not good eye shape. Black can destroy the eye shape by playing at A for example.]

>black cannot cut. See variation.

Therefore white can play A and if black cuts at p4 you might get the same result as in the variation]
;W[op];B[nr];W[rq];B[qr]C[here black should have played s2]

(;W[cg]TR[bm]C[instead of c13 better try to use your influence.
The left side is open at the bottom (marked stone) so there are not many points to get. You need another move there to make territory.

See variation.];B[ci];W[di];B[ch]C[fch [14k?\]: beh, anche io]
;W[dg];B[fm]LB[jn:A]TR[dm]C[Should I have played F7 earlier?

>No. It is really not good that black tries to rescue the maerked stone because it is much to close to the white wall.

It would be good enough for black if he would just go into the centre with A to completely destroy white's influence.

Your plan to seperate those two stones is very good.]

even if black playes n6 white can reduce with A and B.

Let black capture o5. It doesn't hurt that much.];B[mo];W[on]

;W[lk]LB[nh:A]C[Closing way to the centre. Maybe N14 better?

>N14 is too deep in the territory of the opponent.
Better at A. Because if you play n14 then you have to run out of there and you might be succesful with that but then black will get a chance to run into you territory and becomes stronger.]
;B[kl];W[kk];B[jk];W[ik];B[jj];W[ij];B[ni]C[I should have played this rather than J10. Was thinking that J10 leaves door open and a block at J11 can leaves cutting points. Still, this looks bigger.

>in a way j10 is not bad because it seperates the black stones and you get another chance to capture the f9 group.]
