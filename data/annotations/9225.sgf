C[Hello dear Reviewer, in this game I played Black.



I would say my rank is between 1-3k but I am not sure, I started to use a lot of study time with solving baduk problems, but I am often lost in the fuseki and to estimate the situation on the board, I hope with sending games into the GTL I will improve further with the help of other players. I marked my questions & comments with BGO



I sometimes added some variations, so you maybe get more insight on how I would have reacted if he would have answered differently, maybe that helps with the review to know that(?)



I won by resign, and the time was short, but I think I could still learn much by a review that points out my mistakes.]
;B[pd];W[qp];B[dc];W[cp]C[BGO: His formation was unusual for me, but I wasn't overly worried.]
;B[ce];W[jc];B[mc]LB[hc:A]C[A is more common];W[gc];B[oq];W[op]
C[janr: normal would be to pincer, to extend along the right side or to play tenuki.]

(;B[pp]C[janr: unnecessarily aggressive.  I prefer the simple variation]
;W[pq];B[po]
(;W[qq];B[np];W[or];B[oo];W[nr];B[eq]C[janr: black is open to the right side, so this appraoch is not very useful.  White can just extend along the left side and black still won't make territory easily.]
;W[qc]C[janr: it is early to invade];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[nb];W[od];B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rb];B[qf];W[pb];B[oe];W[ql]
C[BGO: I played R10 next, I didn't feel comfortable with playing R5 because he could still make a two space extension and jump out in the free center

janr: may be ok, but take care the q4 group doesnt get too weak]
;B[qj];W[qn];B[dn];W[ep];B[dp];W[dq];B[do];W[er];B[fq];W[cq]
;B[fo];W[fr];B[gq];W[iq]C[janr: white already has access to the lower side.  I prefer to play on the left side.]
;B[oj]C[janr: the left side is still important];W[cg]C[BGO: Now it was hard for me to estimate what next to do, ecause white got already three corners, I just got little on the right side and else just influence, I feel like I did choose the wrong Joseki in the lower right corner.



Next I played C11, because I felt, that white could get in danger with C13 and his G17 group.]
;B[ci]C[janr:  good];W[bn]C[BGO: I thought also about attatching at C13, but I thought that would just help him more then me, so my decision was between just jumping out with E11 or something around G17 group, for example J16 or G15, but in the end I jumped out with E11.]
;B[ei]C[janr: another option is c8, white prevents white to further enter the left side and allows black to focus on the weak white stones there.]
;W[eg];B[ee];W[bi];B[bj];W[bh];B[cj];W[eb];B[db];W[bf];B[be]
;W[ff]
(;B[hd]C[BGO: Was this wrong? White played G16 next and I could cut off K17, but he did get many forcing moves.

janr: splitting the two groups is important
Maybe the best is to just push solidly at f15 in order to not touch/strengthen the two stones above and allow for an attack there later? see variation]
;W[gd]C[janr: now this becomes difficult for black.];B[hc];W[he]
;B[id]LB[gb:A]C[janr: maybe first at A?
anyway it gives poor shape];W[ie];B[jd];W[hb];B[ib];W[gb];B[jb]
;W[je];B[kd];W[ke]
(;B[ec]C[BGO: Was this too slow?

janr: doesnt give black much
But how about the variation?];W[mq]
(;B[rk]C[BGO: Was this too slow/unnecessary? I must shamefully admit that in some games I was invaded at points like R12, and thats the reason why I played angsty S9, but even without S9 a white invasion at R12 seems unlikely to succeed(?)

janr: it is big endgame
Still, the q4 is is getting weaker, and you should stat to calculate how to escape.]

C[janr: I don't think you can capture white directly.
It seems better to first strengthen the q4 group and maybe threaten to capture this white group later.]

;W[cc];B[cb];W[ll];B[oq]C[janr:
In summary, black failed to effectively attackthe weak white stones, and there were several tactical problems such as letting the b8 group connect.
Nevertheless, white did not play the life and death in the upper left correctly and lost a large group.]
