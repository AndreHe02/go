AB[dp][pd]C[DrZoom [4k\]: Hi
DrZoom [4k\]: have fun
jasper2 [6k\]: hi enjoy];W[dd]C[Hi, this is Andre, I'll do my very best to give some useful comments :-). I'll mark them with #.



Hi!
I played Black in this game, but i would be happy to hear comments about white's play as well if possible.
I've added some questions and variations.];B[pq];W[cn];B[fp]
;W[bp];B[cq];W[nc]LB[qo:b][ck:a][po:c][qn:d][pn:e]C[# First of all at our level nobody wins or loses because of this. Second, I think White could perfecly finish the joseki in the lower left with C9 (A). Third, I would probably prefer the lower right over the the upper right, simply because I think attacking a 3-4 stone is more urgent than attacking a 4-4 stone. But then, really, it does not matter. 



Is it better to attack in the bottom left now?];B[pf];W[pb]
;B[qc];W[qe]C[# Yes, this move is bad. It shows to me that White is a little over-eager to rush all over the board. No need for that, especially with just two handicap stones. White should just play a normal game.



this move seemed strange to me. is it joseki? it looked to me like white gets an inferior position at the end of this sequence.]
;B[pe];W[qg];B[qf];W[rg]TR[pe][qe]C[# It is now obvious that R15 was bad. White's position would be better had the two marked stones not been played.]
;B[pg]LB[rf:a][qj:b]C[# I really don't know about this one. It's certainly not really bad, but I wonder if simply S14 (A) or something like B would not be better. No, maybe B is not good, because it leaves the Black stones weak. A seems good, but maybe your move is not bad after all.]
;W[rf];B[qh];W[rh];B[qi];W[ri];B[qj];W[rd]
(;B[lc]C[# It's probably ok, otherwise there would be no attack. And White cannot eally sacrifice these stones. Actually White is in trouble because of the sequence on the right, so maybe after all your way of playing was the right way.


too close to my thickness?];W[ne]LB[qb:a]C[# Now this is really close to Black's thickness. Quite unpleasent. Maybe securing eye space with R18 (A) would be better.]
;B[le]C[# Good!];W[ng];B[fc]LB[lg:a]C[# I would continue one more time with A. Then the distance to F17 is also better.]
;W[cf];B[db];W[oh]C[# This peep is bad. It gains nothing but destroys the possibility of cutting later (a White move around O11 could threat the cut).]
;B[ph]C[# Thank you very much.];W[kd]C[# Another very questionable peep. Black connects of course and then the gap at O16 starts to look quite weak already.]
;B[ld];W[ic]
(;B[cc]LB[lg:a]C[# If White answers this it's good, if not... I think just M13 right away is good.]
;W[cd]LB[jf:a]C[# Of course this is big, but I think it's urgent that White helps the two stones on the upper side. With a move around K14 (A).]
;B[lg]C[# Now Black is clearly ahead in this game. White just has trouble everywhere and virtually no territory.]
;W[lh];B[mf]LB[kg:a]C[# No need to do anything overly fancy here. Just a simple move, such as L13, is good enough. As long as you keep your group stable White is in trouble and cannot most likely not keep both sides.]
;W[nf];B[mh];W[mi];B[li];W[nh];B[kh];W[nj];B[po]TR[pd][pe][pf]
[pg][ph][qc][qf][qh][qi][qj]C[# Ok, now things may get complicated. Basically Black's center group is now really strong with the ponnuki, but the "wall" may run into trouble if you don't pay attention.]
;W[fd]C[# Big.];B[gd];W[gc]
(;B[ge]C[# I think it's better to protect the other stone (see variation).]
;W[fb];B[ec];W[hb];B[bd];W[be];B[ed];W[bc];B[bb];W[ad];B[ef]
;W[dc]C[# Mmh, big loss.];B[eb];W[cb]
(;B[oj]C[# Hard to say, but anyway your move is good, because it helps your own stones, which is very important.


is white's J17 group alive at this point? or can i kill it?
It was difficult for me to figure this out during the game]
;W[ok];B[pk];W[oi];B[pj];W[qp]C[# Better not worry about all these peeps of White :-).


another peep by white which seems strange to me. or am i missing something?]
;B[pp];W[qq]
(;B[qo]C[# Alternatively, Black could also play R2 instead (see variation).]
;W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq];W[ro];B[rn];W[sp];B[mj]LB[mk:a]C[# Maybe a bit too direct. There is no eye there anyway. Just sealing in seems better.]
;W[mk];B[ni];W[rc];B[nk]C[# Not bad, simplifies the game, which is what you should do when the game is won (as it is here).]
;W[qb]C[was i correct to go p8 on this next move? it looked like a necessary defence against the cut at r6]
(;B[ol]LB[ie:a][jp:b]C[# Very bad!!! Pretty much a pass. You play A or B instead and the game is won for sure. R6 is nothing. White R6, Black Q7. It's just a couple of points.]
;W[dk]C[# White should worry about the upper side.];B[em]LB[jp:a]
C[# Maybe K4 (A) instead. Makes it hard to invade.];W[hq]C[# There is enough space, White will easily live.]
;B[gq];W[kq];B[hp]C[# Good.];W[iq];B[ip]LB[gr:a]C[# Mmh, helps White. Maybe G2 instead.]
;W[jp];B[jo];W[ko];B[in]C[# K6 should be possible.];W[eo];B[do]

C[# White ignoring the upper side is very strange.];B[ch];W[fk]
;B[di]LB[bi:a]C[# Helps White it seems. Maybe B11 instead.]
;W[cj]
(;B[kn]C[# I think now it's really time to punish White on the upper side. See variation.]

;W[hd];B[he];W[ie];B[if];W[fe];B[gg]LB[ff:a]C[# Just capturing at F14 is good.]

C[# The game is now closer, but there are still some big moves (A-D).]
;W[lm]C[I misread this next sequence, thinking i could kill white's O15 group (i was getting tired at this point as the game was  quite long...)]

[mo][no][qa][rb][sa][sd][sf][sh]C[# Yeah, I did enjoy it. You could and should have won bigger than that. But you see it is the fighting sequences where 30, 40 points change hands all the time. Overall you played quite well and deserved the win, White was not patient. You could try to punish him harder, but basically your mistakes were often reading mistakes. The worst one was capturing that one stone with P8 for no reason. And not connecting your stones on the left in the end. I propose you keep your thick and patient style, which I like very much, but try to improve a little your overall board perspective to avoid moves like P8 or to close the bottom earlier. Good luck!
