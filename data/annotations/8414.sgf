C[Hello!

I'm Joonas Pihlajamaa, EGF 3 kyu and I'll be doing this review, focusing mainly on white. This seems to be an excellent game to review, and I think I can give you some ideas to help you improve your play!

The beginning of the game was quite calm and almost fightless, and white had the advantage until black invasion. White almost turned the game with his own invasion, but missed some critical moves and died.

But let's get started!];B[pc];W[qp];B[cd];W[dq];B[jc]C[This is probably OK, black could also close one of his corner or approach white's.]
;W[qe]C[Very good move!];B[mc]C[Black plays quite passively. You could already play Q11 or something similar]
;W[co];B[cj]C[Black is building his own side, but playing low moves everywhere, making it easy for white to flatten any territory.]
(;W[pi]C[Very good!];B[cg]C[I feel this is quite passive for black. Now would be a good time to play E17 or E16 as white]
;W[kq]C[Question: Was I too loose in the opening?

I think white played the opening better, spreading his stones better - black has two strong groups with perhaps 20 points each, but white is surrounding much more.

This move could also be at L4, but L3 is also very good. P3 or P4 are also big alternatives, but give black easy invasion on the bottom.]
;B[jj]LB[ec:B][fc:3][jf:2][fj:1][kl:A][op:C]SQ[jc][cd][cg][cj]
C[Question: How would I have responded to this move? It seems odd.

This seems like a natural move - white has the bottom and right side, black has the top and left side (although a bigger gap at the top and smaller left side). Whoever gets the center first has better prospects for large moyo - see my comments for variation at A.

So how to respond? Notice that black is building a box-shaped moyo. One side is solid, but three are still open. Going in from 1 or 2 is still very possible, but you would be creating weak stones without a base. The best course of action I think is to invade around 3 - there should still be room for it. See variation B.

Or, if you are certain it's enough to later just reduce black box around 1 or 2, you can continue to build your own territory. C would be one option.]
(;W[pm]C[This is a good move, but black would now have the opportunity to invade at P3 or further secure his moyo by playing E17 or something similar.]
;B[mg]C[Now E17 would ruin most of what black has been building, and your framework is still intact.]
;W[qb]C[Question: Was there a better way to attack this corner?

Definitely, for example at R17.]
(;B[pb]C[Ouch. Bad move for black.];W[qc];B[pe];W[pd];B[od]
;W[qd];B[pf];W[qf];B[pg]
(;W[qg]C[You should not push from behind more than is necessary.]
;B[nc];W[dl];B[ej];W[fl]C[If you are able to build a wall towards bottom and keep all your potential territory, you will win the game because you have taken 14 points on the right top and black has lost 21 points there. 

However, black is probably able to live on the bottom because triangled stones are not yet enough to kill black, and if that happens, you will not get enough points. So helping black to build this wall may not be the best idea.]
;B[gj]LB[ec:A][li:B]C[For all purposes, black wall cannot be penetrated. If it was me, I'd try to invade at A, because it will lose no points if I fail (as long as black needs to respond).

Only hole in black wall is around B, but it's hard to get far there, and most likely will not help white in building his own wall.]
;W[bk]C[This is quite small move and should be saved for later.]
;B[bj]C[Now white has to respond and he loses sente, after making only few points.]
;W[ck];B[mj]LB[ec:E][ko:D][jp:C][op:B][oq:A][dr:F]TR[dp][ep]
[fp][fq]C[Question: On their side, Was that wall a good idea?

Wall itself seems like a good idea, but I'm not sure if this last move is needed. It would be better for black to play one of the marked moves instead.

F may not live, but is sometimes played as a probe against the corner to see how white responds. It might create some sequences black might take advantage to get stones around triangled area to help later moves at C or D.]
;W[ni];B[mi];W[hk];B[hj]C[Question: How could i have better attacked that wall?

There does not seem much to do against it. So long as you build your own wall, all is good, and you succeeded well in that!

But note that every stone to this wall makes E17 (or around there) invasion less likely to work!]
;W[ng];B[nf];W[og];B[of];W[mh];B[nh];W[oh];B[lh]
(;W[nh]LB[ph:A][nj:B]C[It's not necessary to save one stone, better to play A or B if you want to continue locally]

(;B[ch]LB[qa:A][ph:B][nj:C][jl:G][ko:F][jp:E][oq:D]C[Black is overly protective, he should rather play at somewhere else.]
;W[jk];B[ik];W[il];B[ij];W[jl];B[fc]C[Now there is no room for white to invade, but white has made amazing wall due to black's passive responses. Black should have omitted one move somewhere to play on bottom or jump inside white framework!

White should now either fix his O12 problem or secure the bottom.]
;W[nj]C[Good!];B[kj]C[This is a terrible move, white just gained a free move.]
(;W[lj]C[This move is 1 point and you lose sente. Better to play even M9 and have 1 additional liberty if black tries to break through!]
;B[li];W[lk];B[kk];W[kl];B[ph];W[qh];B[qi]

(;B[oj]C[Slow move for black, better alternatives exist.]
(;W[nk];B[oi];W[ok];B[pk];W[pl];B[pi]C[It is not necessary to protect here. White would probably win the game by playing at the bottom now.]
(;W[rl];B[gq]C[A very good proverb at go that will help you in this situation and similar situations is: When attacking, keep your distance. 

Here especially where you are strong everywhere and black has nowhere to run, it is best first to take away black base.]
(;W[gp]C[This contact play helps black stone to get stronger]
;B[iq];W[jp];B[er];W[dr]C[Question: In this battle how could I have defended better?

See the variations before. This move is good, and you still have chance to kill black.]
;B[fq]
(;W[fp];B[fs];W[jr];B[ir]C[Can you see the eyeshape black just made? If you want to kill, there is exactly one move now.]
(;W[ds]
(;B[es]C[Still time to play G2];W[eq];B[gr]C[Now black is alibe, and you should focus on damage control. Left side seems OK, but K2 looks bad.]
(;W[hp];B[hq]C[Seems like unnecessary move for black.];W[is]
;B[hs]C[Now it would be a good place to note that black is alive. and sacrifice J1 stone to getter better shape outside]
(;W[js];B[jq]
(;W[ip];B[kr]C[Ouch!];W[lr];B[ks]C[Now the second important thing about fighting these types of gradual losses in territory: It is very hard to stop anything at the first line (M1)! You should either fall back (a move such as N2) or eliminate your cutting points so you can stop black]
(;W[ls]C[:(

On the other hand, this is a thing that will quickly disappear in your games when you play more, so no need to worry about it too much!]
;B[lq];W[kp];B[mr]C[Now the problem has escalated and you cannot simply stop black anymore. The best at this point would be to consider O2 area as lost and surround black from further away - contact play makes it just too easy to cut, eat stones and go forward.]

;B[os];W[aj]
(;B[ai];W[ak];B[bh];W[pa];B[oa];W[qa];B[nb]C[You got both remaining endgame moves, very good!]
;W[tt];B[ml]TR[ri][rj][qk][pl][rl][pm][lp][mp][np]C[A good way to think in these situations when opponent makes a "desperate" invasion is to consides what is strong and what weak. Triangled stones are strong, so no need to worry about those - instead, spend a move to strengthen the remaining ones and black will have hard time (and less ko threats).]

[lr][gs][is][js][ls]C[Thanks for you help!

My pleasure! Here are the summarized points about the game:

1. Your fuseki (opening) was very good, you should be able to improve 5-6 stones before you need to focus on it.

2. Both of you spent most of the middle game building a wall in the center, while there were still points in the bottom / top where the opponent could invade. If either had broken off from "wall-building", he would've had the advantage. I'd advise stopping from time to time to consider if there would be other areas of the board where it would be more profitable to play.

3. Black made a late invasion at the bottom which should likely have died, had you attacked from distance. After that white made several consecutive errors that lost the whole bottom. That is mostly just reading, which will improve as you play more. I warmly recommend basic tsumego (go problems) such as in goproblems.com if you want to improve faster - it will give you an edge over your opponents in reading and improve your games a lot.

4. There were two big life and death problems in the game, studying L&D tsumego would also help here. Of course, if you can get a hold on James Davies' "Life and Death" book, it's also very valuable.

I hope you a warm summer and good games in the future. :)
