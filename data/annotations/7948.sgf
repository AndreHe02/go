C[Hi, thanks for taking the time to review this game. I've only been playing about a week but have attacked the game with full force. Near the end, I just do some really silly things and end up resigning. Before that though I thought I was doing reasonably well but didn't know where to go. Once again thanks.

Oh yea, I should also note that I am not a 15k player, probably closer to 25k and I am playing white.

-- Hello, my name is Sven and I' m about 7 kyu at DGS. I will try and clear things a bit up for you. All my comments are preceded by "--" so you can spot them more easily.
-- In general, Black and White were rather well balanced as concerns reading ability. The main point which lost you the game might be that you started your game territory-orientated by playing on the third line at various occasions. But later on, especially after move 60, you tried to make territory in the center. By White neglecting the lower and upper right corner, Black was able to make large pieces of territory there. So - apart from the details in the following comments - my general advice is to keep in mind that the corners are most important and one should stick to one strategy that one has started (playing low for territory versus playing high for influence).]

(;W[cd]LB[dc:C][ec:A][ed:B]TR[pd]C[Is C16 just begging for black to play E17?

-- I think Black would rather play at B on the forth line, which works better with the marked stone in building influence towards the center.
C might be better, see variations]
(;B[fq]
(;W[cn]LB[nc:B][jp:A]C[Would a pincer be better here? Why?

-- a difficult question. I don't think a close pincer (see variations) is good, but perhaps a hight three-space-pincer at A might foil Black's intentions towards the center..
Another option is attacking one of the 4-4-stones.];B[cq];W[dq]

It is too far away from the marked black stones to endanger them, and there is no territory for White here, since the center is wide open to the bottom
