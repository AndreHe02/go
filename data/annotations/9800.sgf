C[Hello,  
I am Niko and I will do your review today. My comments will me marked with "N:".
Let me start with some general comments.
In the game you played solid most of the times and were able to clearly win the game.
At several points in the game you missed to play some big moves.
Maybe it could help you in later games to ask yourselve if the next move is neccessary or 
if you could play a bigger move somewhere else.];B[qp];W[dd]
;B[cp]
(;W[ep]C[The lower side is really big with 2 3-4s. I thought that it's bigger than a star point

N: In my oppinion at this early point in the game this kind of moves are a kind of flavor and playable.
For this situation I don't think it is urgent ro play here, as I do not see a good way for black to secure both corners at once. Both stones are close to the side and thus have increased influences to the left and right side and less influence to the bottom. If black tries to make territory on the bottom, white can always attack the other side.
But if black now decides to play at the top right corner, white has one additional move at the bottom, so it might still be ok.]
;B[dq];W[eq];B[dn];W[iq];B[nq];W[qd]TR[pj][qp][nq]C[N: With this move you build a strength to the marked side. But black already has some strong influence for himselfe, so you might not be able to fully utilize the potential of the stone.]
;B[qg]
(;W[oc]TR[od]C[didn't know how to answer this approach. But a shimari is always ok?

N: The black move looks too soft.. You could play up (triangle) to increase the pressure on the black stone. 
But this underlines the point I made for the stone R16. You did not use the potential of the stone on the right side.
Compare this situation with the one in the variation.];B[qj]
;W[qn]LB[oo:A]TR[qm]C[really strange move IMO. I wanted to invade but I just split 2 perfectly fine groups Maybe play a bigger move on the upper side?

N: I agree. In addition, what would you have answered to black A? This looks uncomfortable for white. If you want to go in there instead of buildiong something for yourselve, one point up might be better.]
;B[pq]C[N: Bad move from black - you are lucky];W[on];B[jc]
;W[gc];B[mc];W[je]LB[dj:A]C[don't know if this is a good move.  I wanted to attack the weak group but maybe another move is better?


N: With this attack you allow black to counter attack your -as you know - weak shimari. How about taking a big point at A or at least play from the other side to help your shimari and put a bit of pressure on the black groupe at the same time?]
;B[me];W[oe]C[attacking while helping my shimari

N: I don't see black in danger here.So you are more pushing black against your already weak corner. You invest quite some moves here, and black secures his A&B group.  Also black can get out of there in sente to take the left side. This is a bad outcome for you.]
;B[mg];W[og]C[trying to attack the right group];B[re];W[rd]
;B[qe];W[pe];B[ql]TR[om][qm]C[N: This move would be not possible for black if your stones were one line up.]
;W[mn]C[Now I was afraid that my 2 stones get in trouble and answered

N: As you see black had some sente moves here and now he can also play a big move on the side. So the black group on the right was not so weak after all.]
;B[dj]TR[gc][dd]C[N: This moves hurts you. With the marked stones a white extention on the left side gives you some great potential.]
;W[dg]TR[cg]C[N: Maybe play low to exploit blacks high stone here?]
;B[ch]LB[cc:A]C[I thank my opponent for this move. this only strengthed me

N: In general the move does make sense, but if you take into account that black later on played A to attack the corner tihs move is bad.  But the point of securing blacks territory is valid.  Your corner is already very strong, so this extra stone is not doing much here.]
;W[cg];B[cl]TR[dj]C[N: this one looks  much too small. Good for you. If black is so concerned he should not have played the marked stone high in the first place.]
;W[lq];B[gq];W[go]LB[gp:A]TR[ep][eq]C[I thought I was strong enough to attack the stone

N: Also your stones will be very weak if black plays this move. Maybe attaching at A is better to avoid the complications of the cut later on?]
;B[fo];W[fp]TR[gr]C[N: I cannot read out all variations but maybe attaching from below is better?]
;B[eo]TR[gp]C[shouldn't he cut?

N: I think so too. When black cuts it will be hard for white to save the white stones.]
;W[gp]C[protecting the cut];B[gn];W[hn];B[gm];W[fg]TR[hm]C[building something. After this move I was afraid of the 3-3

N: securing the corner might be better. Even if black gets this move, white also can keep expanding at the bottom.]
;B[cc]C[here it is

N: see http://senseis.xmp.net/?Butterfly  for usefull variations.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[eb];W[fb]
(;B[cb]TR[ed]C[That move looks strange.

N: see variation];W[bd]C[This was definetly sente and I didn't know how to kill this group

N: With this move it should be dead already.];B[ac]C[I don't unterstand this answer.]
;W[bc];B[ed];W[fc];B[id]
(;W[bb]C[is this necessary to kill?
N: Should be already dead. See variation.];B[he];W[ge]TR[fe]
C[N: Maybe like this?]
(;B[ig];W[gf];B[hf];W[hm]C[N: This is a very big move.];B[kg]
C[IMO he wasted a lot of moves for this kinda "small" area?

N: You responded 2 of his moves locally, so the moves are not wasted. But yes, his actual moves are not doing much.  Look for the variation starting at 62 for a more effective playing of black.  You now should continue at the bottom.]
;W[rf]TR[hk][gl]C[I know this is end game. don't know why I played it so early

N: black did not answer locally, now you can push him and build a nice wall.]
;B[qf];W[se];B[rg];W[sf];B[sg];W[sd];B[qi];W[rl]TR[rm]C[can't he cut? (after I swa that this move works against him I used it like 3 times in the game)

N: Looks like he can cut  - See variation]
(;B[rk];W[rm];B[ri]C[why does he answer there?

N: The true answer might be: "He just lost a corner and now he is scared."]

;B[em];W[pk]C[I saw that my lower area could be big and that move could help me with that]
;B[oi];W[nk];B[qk];W[cs]TR[jj]C[end game early on?

N: You still have soo much potential with your bottom group...]
;B[jj]C[he played the bigger move

N: this should have been yours.];W[jl];B[lj];W[ll]C[I like to answer there to build this big area

N: But it could have been so much bigger :-)];B[mk]C[N: black should defend the corner.]
;W[ml];B[nj];W[ol];B[nh];W[br]C[Now this seems big];B[bq];W[cq]
;B[bp]C[leaving the ko open after this cause there are bigger moves left]
;W[sq];B[rr];W[op];B[pp];W[oq];B[oo];W[no];B[or];W[po]TR[bh]

N: yes, maybe B12?];B[ms];W[ls];B[fj];W[gi]C[can this be cut?

N: I don't see how.]

N: As there are so much Ko threads left, the marked positions are larger.]
