C[Hello! Sorry for the slight delay in finishing this, I have been super busy as of late and there were some variations that I wanted to look at properly before I sent off the review.

Some general comments: apart from a few inaccuracies in joseki, started off well for both sides up until black's invasion on the right.  Here both sides made mistakes, but black ultimately came out on top.  I've tried to go through the variations well enough to see how certain moves might have worked out, but not in so much detail that it makes difficult to learn from.

I've provided my email below should you wish to contact me e.g. if you want to go through a variation, request an informal review etc.  I've also provided some Go resources which you may find useful!

duder@hotmail.co.uk

As I say, if you want to ask anything, don't hesitate to get in touch. Enjoy!

Resources:

 - www.goproblems.com [Great site, helps inform intuition when big fights break out!\]
 - www.turbogo.com/text/jostutor.html [Interactive joseki site\]
 - Kogo's Joseki Dictionary [Available for free on the internet (just google it) - helps to have another source\]
 - Get strong at the opening (Richard Bozulich) [In case you want to purchase a book, this comes heavily recommended - really helped me get to grips with positional play, and become a stronger player\]

[belettego\] Canicus and I played this game and want to review it also to another. Besides this I'd thought it to be a good idea getting a review from a stronger player. So that we both could learn from that more.

I wrote three questions from the view of B in the comments and would be interested in all advice concerning the opening and big tactical/strategical mistakes that followed (by both players, so that W and B can discuss the review).

I added two comments on game stations which I think to be crucial and would need help about how to handle.

Thank you very much in advance.

[kp][kq]LB[pn:a][qm:b][di:c]C[This is a passive move from black (and as far as I know isn't a part of standard joseki).  Standard responses are A and B - R6 limits the extension to just one space, but lacks the pressure the Q6 has.

I'd personally prefer to play a pincer in this situation (square), building upon the solid corner black has, and hopefully playing a move later at C, dominating the lower left.]
;W[lq];B[fc]
(;W[oc]SQ[ic][id][jd][jc]MA[qd]LB[hc:a]C[Here I think a loose pincer (square) would be more effective - this will simultaneously put F17 under pressure and work in conjunction with R16 (cross).  A tight pincer such as A would not work as well as this enables black to overcome the influence of R16 (see variation)]
;B[cf];W[ee];B[ci]LB[cc:a]C[A is the standard response to this move, forcing white out into the centre.  Playing like this allows white to secure himself by taking the corner]
;W[gd]C[Good move];B[gc];W[hd];B[dc]C[Good continuation from black]
(;W[hc]LB[cc:a]C[This is a good move, A is another alternative (see variation).  H17 stakes a claim at the top, but this is not secure territory, in exchange for black taking the corner.  C17 on the other hand splits blacks two groups apart, forcing black up the top side in exchange for a small stake on the corner

Comparing the outcome of both situations I'd say H17 is the better move here]
;B[cd];W[de];B[ce];W[qi]TR[de][ee][gd][hd][hc][qd][oc]LB[pj:a]
[pi:b]C[This move should definitely be played one line higher, and possibly one space wider at A.  The reason it should be on the 4th line, is to emphasize the influence white has built up top.  Whilst A is the ideal space away, it invites invasion from black, so B might be the move to play here]
;B[qk];W[hq]TR[oc][qd][hc][hd][gd][ee][de]LB[oj:a][fi:b]C[A is probably white's biggest move at the moment.  If black fails to respond, a well placed move at B sees white commanding the upper right quadrant]
;B[qh]LB[ph:a]C[This is an interesting move by black.  Playing A is the best option for white (see variation)]
(;W[pi]C[This looks to be a safe move, but it throws things into confusion when black also extends]
;B[ph];W[oh];B[og];W[nh];B[ng]TR[qd][oc]MA[oi][pg]LB[pf:a][mh:b]
C[This is quite a complicated tussle between white and black so I'll go into more depth here.

The crucial point is that both sides are weak with cutting points at P11 and Q13.  Ideally white wants to exploit black's weakness and protect his own.

Although fraught with danger, cutting at Q13 is one of the best options for white.  Having said that, it is hard to read ahead without actually playing it out, so I can't blame white for not playing it.  See variation.

Another alternative is the peep at A.  This would be a bad move however - this basically allows black to fix his weakness for free, while white does nothing to fix his.

Finally, the move at B which white played (probably the next best alternative after the cut at Q3) - provisionally protects against the cut (black will be caught in a ladder) whilst keeping up the pressure on black]
(;W[mh];B[mf]LB[pf:a][pg:b]C[This is a poor move by black.  This time it is the peep at A that is the better move (as white has fixed his weakness so can go on the attack immediately after) and the cut at B which is the bad move (see variations)]
(;W[mg]C[This move merely allows black to secure himself];B[nf]
LB[pf:a][lc:b]C[White has two options]
(;W[md]LB[pf:a][lc:b]C[[belettego\] Here I think I failed hunting the group. B lived later and got quite strong.

this move is in the right direction but the placement is poor (should be at B).  The reason is that white is too close to the black group and enables him to attach, which is ultimately the reason why black becomes strong.

Playing moves such as B are advantageous (see variation for more info).  Playing at A with the peep is also an option, but black will probably ignore it (see variations)]
;B[ld]TR[md]LB[lc:a][le:b]C[There is a proverb which says "When you are weak, attach against your opponent; when your opponent is weak, do not attach against your opponent."

This illustrates this proverb very well - white is now under pressure to sort out the white stone, and with the exchange A-B black starts to become strong]
;W[lc];B[le]TR[dd][de][ee][gd][hd][hc]LB[kc:a][jf:b]C[Now black has begun to put pressure on white.  As soon as black plays A the white stones on the left are cut off from the main group, thus linking up has now become white's priority.  Black also has moves such as B to extend into the centre.]
;W[jg]TR[qi][pi][oh][nh][mh][mg][gd][hd][hc][ee][de][dd]C[Good move, linking up two weak groups to make them both stronger.  Also puts pressure on black]
;B[kc]
(;W[kd]TR[le][ld]LB[mc:a]C[The two black stones here are not under any threat.. the crosscut here is a bad idea.  A simple connect at A is best and keeps the pressure on black (see variation).]
;B[mc]LB[lb:a]C[Here white is best extending to A (see variation).  Sacrificing this stone allows black to become strong]
(;W[nc];B[lb];W[mb];B[lc];W[nb];B[nd];W[od];B[ne]TR[jg][mh]
[nh][oh][mg][ee][de][pi][qi]MA[eg]LB[ok:a][qr:b][cl:c][ei:d]
[dj:e][dh:f]C[Now black is alive, the top corner comes to a pause.  White is now behind and must look for the biggest move possible to play.

Looking at the present situation, white has developed some influence towards the centre - ideally white would like to use this influence either to attack black, or to develop a moyo.  However, black has no weak groups to attack, and any move that attempts to create territory here is likely to either be too slow, or to be an overplay. However, the left side is open to attack, which white may be able to use to his advantage.

Of the moves labelled, D is the best move. I shall discuss them all in a bit of detail:

A) Strengthens white stones, confines black to the side - not a bad move.  There is not much gain here for white though, and black won't have a hard time erasing white's influence

B) A small move. Save this for later.

C) It's tempting to dive straight into the left hand side, but black will attack and ultimately white will gain little.

D) This is a good move considering the circumstances, as it puts pressure on the left side, and works towards developing the centre (see variation)

E) The shoulder hit might normally be a good move in this position, but black will wedge himself between E and the stones at the top.  This leaves the left side for white to invade, but white's stones will not be working coherently

F) The shoulder hit on the other side is also possible, but too slow in developing]
(;W[jd]C[Compare to the moves before - this is a very small move for white!]
(;B[jc]LB[gp:a][dl:b]C[Another small move - this is not very threatening to white.  Instead, black should look to develop the left hand side - a shoulder hit at A is perfect (see variation).  A move at B also works well in securing the left side, but it doesn't take the initiative in the same way as A]
;W[ic]C[White is no danger - no need to secure the top here]
;B[ib]TR[jb][kb][ka][ja]CR[ck][cl][cm][bn][bm][bl][bk][bj][cn]
[bo][ao][an][am][al][ak][aj]SQ[fp][fo][eo][ep][do][dp][en]LB[dl:a]
[gp:b][hp:c]C[The triangles show just how small this move is - 4 points. Compare with a move at A - 16 points - 4 times as many!  A move at B is worth a little more than at the top, but threatens white's postion so must respond with C.]
;W[hb]CR[gb][ga][ha][ia][jb]SQ[ff][fg][fh][fi][gi][hi][ii][ji]
[gh][hh][ih][jh][ig][hg][gg][gf][hf][if]LB[ei:a]C[This move is approx. worth 5 points.  Compare with a move at A - the potential for points is huge!]
;B[ia]SQ[jb][kb][ka][ja]C[Again only 4 points gained.  These are definitely moves that should be saved for the endgame]
;W[ha];B[jb];W[rh];B[qg]C[This is a necessary precaution]
(;W[rf]MA[oi][ri][rg]C[White is stretched too thinly here.  Three cutting points are marked.  A move at S13 is much more solid, and more threatening (see variation)]
;B[rg];W[sg];B[ri]LB[sh:a]C[White can still get away with this however]
(;W[qf];B[sh];W[sf];B[pf];W[pe];B[oe]MA[of]C[This move was worth one point.  I'm trust I won't have to press the point I am making any more :)]
;W[ok]C[[belettego\] Should W invade around C7 now?

See move 51, this addresses this question in full, I'll save repeating here.  But short answer, yes, white should be trying to prevent black from making territory on the left.  Ideally white would make some territory in the centre at the same time so C7 is not the move here.]
;B[cl]MA[ci][cp]LB[dl:a]C[A minor point, but black's stones are too low, this move should be at A to address the balance]
;W[om]MA[hq][lq][oq][ok][pi][oh][nh][mh][jg]LB[hl:a][il:b][ik:c]
[hk:d][fp:e]C[A slow move.  White is building influence all on one side which black can simply remove with a move at A-D

Better, would be to try flatten blacks stones on the left with a move such as E in order to build some influence from the left towards the centre

Having said that, at this stage of the game, white only has a small hope of trying to control the centre, especially seen as black can invade the centre easily from a few places]
;B[fn];W[hn]C[Good move];B[gl];W[il];B[hj]

[nk][nj][mj][kj][lj]CR[fm][em][dm][dl][el][fl][fk][fj][gj][ej]
[dj][dk][ek]LB[ei:a]C[[belettego\] I was wondering how to deal with B leaning on W.

Hmm. I'd say white's moves are the best to play in this situation. The area that white seals off is too big to lose to black.  White could try an offensive move such as A, but that would likely end badly for white.  Judging from the amount of territory gained I'd say this actually benefits white]
;B[eg]C[The rest of the moves from here on are endgame moves so this will be my last comment.  I hope the review has been useful for you both.  I've put my email on the first move, but I'll put it here again should you wish to ask any questions, go through any variations etc
