C[Panda123 [4k\]: Hello, I lost this game due to some miscalculations but I am not sure but some of the moves which lead to my loss. Thanks before hand for even seeing my game =)
Panda123 [4k\]: I am actually quite worried about my begining 50 moves, the latter moves, I made some bad mistake i should not have but also need some help with specific moves. I am not sure when to use certain josekis and when to give up stones for sente and territory. Thanks.

Hey, My name is Amar and I'm dN21death[2d\] on KGS. I saw that you also play on KGS so if you have any questions about the review, feel free to ask me if you ever see me on KGS. One of the important things you should work on is shape. Getting better at reading is a must too. Lots of the comments are in the variations which are pretty confusing to scroll through so take your time. :D]

(;B[dj]C[Odd opening. Usually if you play here its a low play.
Low play is better first of all because you would probably want to make a base. A high play would be used for some of the reasons here: 
1. Making a framework.
2. Reducing a framework.
3. Help with fighting.];W[qj]
(;B[do]C[i would prefer to approach on top side because thats where w has his shimari extension.]
;W[dm]C[Panda123 [4k\]: I am not sure how to respond to this move here. I know there are some basic josekis for this but i am not sure how to respond seeing D10 piece is there also.

D10 can only help you here if you use it right.
Here are a few josekis.]

This move lets w connect his stones but w didnt play that way I'll show you.]

;B[df]C[Panda123 [4k\]: Was this move too early?
I don't know much about the two-space high approach but I'm also not sure why u played this and not the one-space low or high approach. Are you scared of getting pincered?]
;W[dh]C[Well here I don't know why w pincered I guess he likes fighting. Top is more important I think. Variations here are complex.
To keep it simple I might just jump out.]
(;B[eh]C[Only reason you would play this is because you want to connect under.]
