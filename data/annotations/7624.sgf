C[I played white. 30 minutes main time each, komi 6.5. My opponent was unrated, though I think s/he is probably a mid-teens kyu player.


hi - my name is markus and i hope i can help you with my review]
;B[dp];W[pd];B[qp];W[dd]C[I confess the opening is still a mystery to me. I just play the star points, then try to build influence or territory depending on my opponent's moves.]
;B[cf]TR[fc][gc][fd]C[i have never seen your response. quite common moves are at the marked points. i think your move G16 is a little too far from your star point and leaves a defect for invasion at f17.]
(;W[gd]TR[fc]C[Is this a good response to Black's approach? I play it quite frequently now. Previously I would play at C15 or something similiarly close, but this move seems to work better.

once more i think your move is a little too far from your star point and leaves a defect for an  invasion at f17.
and C15 is a bad move as you could see.];B[bd]
(;W[ce];B[be];W[cc]C[At the time this move felt good, fast but safe, but looking back it seems like it could have been a mistake. (B at C16?)

b c16 gains nothing
now you have to play c17 and c15 was a lost move]
(;B[de]LB[cd:B][de:A]C[after analysing your game i think the reason why you lost is that your direction of play was wrong - so black could make a huge territory on the left side]
(;W[cd];B[ee];W[ed];B[fe];W[bc]C[I was pleased with this exchange, since my wall is fairly high and it seems like I could take 20 points in the corner and maybe extend along the top side.

your moves secure the corner, but black got a huge, impressive wall and with his next move he stakes out a huge territory]
;B[dj]C[nearly the whole left side is controlled by black now!!

this is the reason why you should have played the other sequence]
;W[cq]LB[hf:A][fj:B][jq:C]C[I now feel this invasion is a mistake at this stage...would a play at Q10 have been better? At several points in this game I think I allowed Black to dominate the board with expansive plays, while I got bogged down in tactical battles.

you are right - the invasion is too early. Q10 is better

also important points are A or B to reduce the black territory 
and C to get a base on the lower side];B[cp];W[dq];B[eq];W[er]
;B[fq];W[fr];B[gq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[co]C[This is a sequence I've seen a lot (is it a basic joseki?) but it doesn't seem like White comes out with much.

yes this is basic - as you realized the invasion is too early - you gain ca 10 points, whereas black can secure the left side and a white invasion is nearly impossible now
now it is important to reduce blacks left side]
(;W[jj]LB[hf:B][fj:A]C[well done - correct idea but a little too far away from black A or B seem better to me]
;B[nc]C[I think it's during the fight in this top-right corner that I lost this game, but I'm not certain how it happened.]
(;W[kd]C[Attempting a pincer here.];B[pb]C[This move suprised me. It looks strange and I'm not sure if I dealt with it well.

this move is standard, invading the corner];W[qf];B[qc]C[A 3-3 invasion, but at the time I didn't see it as such. The other black stones complicate things. My intention here is to let Black have the corner and build big inlfuence towards the centre, but it didn't work out.
Perhaps my next move should have answered more solidly at R16? Or maybe P16, allowing Black to take more of the corner but building a solid wall for myself.


this is a good idea but p16 and r16 are too slow];W[oc];B[ob]
;W[nd];B[mc];W[md];B[oe]
(;W[pe]C[A poor move?

yes];B[nf]
(;W[mg]C[Trying to contain the two black stones and prevent my group from getting shut in.]
;B[od];W[pc];B[pf]C[I've tried variations here where I connect at R15, but I couldn't save the 4 stones. Suddenly I look weak in this corner.]
(;W[og];B[qe];W[lc]C[this is a very good move! now the defect of L16 is repaired]
;B[pg]LB[fj:B][op:A][lq:C]
(;W[mb]LB[fj:B][op:A][lq:C]C[Trying to build influence, with a view to taking the top side and maybe the middle.

this move is sente but small - big moves are as i have shown]
;B[nb];W[lb]LB[fj:B][op:A][lq:C]C[you still had the opportunity to play A, B or C

to save your stone is too small];B[ng];W[ne]LB[fj:B][op:A][lq:C]
C[Bad move? Playing where Black is strong,

yes. here is nothing to gain. there are nearly no points. still A, B or C]
;B[of];W[mf];B[nh];W[jg]LB[op:A][lq:B]C[Trying to control the middle.

too slow. with the next move black controlls the lower side
so you had to play there]
(;B[lp]C[From this point on the game seems to run away from me. Black shows more aggression and  makes big frameworks. Perhaps I should have played in the bottom right earlier...but I'm not sure what kind of plays would have been safe.]
;W[pk];B[qm]LB[ge:D][ei:B][fj:A][el:E][jp:C]C[there are many points to play but it is hard to say which one is best - it depends on your style and mood]
;W[mj];B[nk];W[nj]C[Now I try to keep separated Black's groups in the top and bottom corners.

this has no effect, because black already lives on the top and you only help him to secure  territory - as you can see he attacks you and gains territory whereas you have to save your stones. the game is already lost]
;B[ok];W[oj];B[pj];W[pi];B[qj];W[qk];B[qi];W[oh];B[oi];W[ni]
;B[ph];W[qh]LB[lp:A]C[At the time I thought this was a blunder (trying to be too clever instead of connecting at P11)...but perhaps I couldn't save the three white stones anyway. Maybe I should have taken this opportunity to attack the bottom right, but I felt I had no base to attack from yet.

the black position at the bottom right is very stable, so it is nearly impossible to attack. i do not see a good way for attacking - A is in an excellent position for defense]
;B[oi];W[mh];B[mm]C[Now Black looks strong in the bottom right.]
;W[jq]C[A hopeful attempt to extend my territory in the bottom left, and launch an attack on the bottom right...]

;W[gr];B[hr]C[...but it looks hopeless.];W[fh];B[gj];W[fi]C[A slow play, I think...these stones (F12 and the group that grows from it) are ultimately cut off and killed. At this point it looks like they should be easy to make secure.]

a short conclusion of your game is:

first you went into the wrong direction in the upper left corner letting black make a huge territory on the left side.

the second big failure was that you did not make a base on the lower side (the 3,3 invasion on the lower left was too early and made it difficult to create a base or make a lot of points there)

thirdly you missed reduction on the left side

you only played on the top, securing some points there while black used the whole board...

so i hope i could help you - if you have any further questions feel free to contact me]
