C[*Hello, my name is Litost, I am around 1k, and I'll be your reviewer. All my comments with start with a star (*).

* As a synthesis, I would say that your play is flexible. You should however be paying a bit more attention to good shape / bad shape (especially what makes a group heavy and light).

* Shape is essential in go. A good shape make your stones solid, and you can play agressively without having to worry about your opponent retaliating. Bad shape, on the contrary, is a burden, since your opponent can attack it continuously, and gain profit from attacking (either territory, more influence to attack elsewhere, or even a kill).]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[fq];W[op];B[dq]LB[kq:A]C[* As Black, I would rather pincer the P3 stone, (for instance around A) trying to develop both sides.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq];B[ro];W[qn]C[* I have never seen this move. The shape looks a bit thin to me, because Black can separate white stones and then pincer in either direction. Still, it's an interesting move, leading to dynamic situations.]
;B[rn]LB[po:A]C[* This move by Black is a mistake, playing at A (forcing bad shape on White with an elephant's eye) was necessary. Crawling on the second line is painful.]
;W[qm]C[* Of course, White should not allow Black to come out, so this move is excellent.]
;B[rm];W[ql];B[cq];W[rl]C[* Coming back here to make this turn is the right decision. Now Black will be enclosed with little territory, so we can say that you have gained the lead from this move on.]
;B[qr];W[pr];B[rr]LB[po:A]C[* Excellent result for White here. Still a weakness at A, to be aware of (Black can try and activate some aji with a peep later).]
;W[qf];B[of];W[ph];B[qd];W[nc]LB[ic:A][cf:D][cj:C][iq:B]C[* An agressive play, and maybe an overplay. While this move is usual in handicap go, there are other big points on the board (from A to D).]
(;B[oc]C[* A bit passive. Black needs a pincer here, all the more this pincer could work well with a kakari on the top left. See variation.]
(;W[nd]LB[ic:A]C[* While this is usually the correct shape locally, it appears to be  too heavy here. If Black pincers right  now, then your stones will have a hard time.

* Why not a soft extension at the top, treating O17 as a forcing move? Black is already very solid on this corner, so will not add a move.]
;B[pf];W[qg];B[lc]C[* A bit close, but the right direction.]
(;W[ic]C[* This shows the problem of the o17 sequence. Now you change your strategy and sacrifice, but Black gains a lot of points in the process - and I'm afraid that the advantage you had gained at the bottom right has now vanished.

* Why not try and follow-up by extracting the group with a kosumi ? See variation.]
;B[le];W[if]LB[cf:C][ci:B][iq:A]C[* This lacks a bit of direction. Also, you are not really attacking any Black group, and Black has enough space to invade and live inside your moyo.

* An extension at the bottom at A ("extend from thickness"), or or on the left side at B or C ("reduce the opponent's influence") would be good candidate moves.]
;B[lg]C[* A bit slow, though good for the balance of power, as it reduces a bit White's influence.

* Balance of territory: black has about 40 points, white about 15 points. 

* Balance of power: White has better prospects (a good influence and something like a moyo at the top).

* Black's strategy now could be to gently offset White influence while making territory. White's strategy could concentrate on enlarging the moyo, inducing an invasion, and looking for some fight.]
;W[hq]LB[cj:C][iq:A][jq:B]C[* Good direction, but I feel this is a bit too close. I would play at J3, or maybe K3. Now Black can pincer the stone, and still have room to make shape against your influence.

* Also, maybe C, offsetting Black's influence and building a moyo, should be considered.]
;B[ip]C[* A standard reduction move. This reflects Black's style, which is pretty calm so far.]
;W[hp];B[iq]
(;W[kq]LB[io:A]C[* I understand your wish to deprive Black from his base, but here the two White stones come under a severe attack. J5, playing at the head of two stones, was the correct shape, to be played absolutely.

* When attacking, it's first a story about who's making the good shape and who's forcing a bad shape on the opponent. Attacking from bad shape is nearly impossible, so this preliminary fight is essential.]
;B[ho]C[* The right shape for Black.]
(;W[gp]C[* Playing an empty triangle really hurts. In such cases, where the opponent drives you around and forces bad shape upon you, it is always good to stop and ponder whether playing the bad shape really is necessary. See variation.]
;B[go];W[fp];B[hr];W[gr];B[ir];W[eq];B[er]
(;W[fr]C[* You must connect here.];B[ep];W[eo]
(;B[eq]C[* Black could also fight the ko, with little to lose.]
;W[fo];B[gq]C[* A bit slow, but it does connect effectively, so probably the correct move.

* Balance of territory : Black has around 50 points, White around 20 points.

* Balance of power : White's influence has been damaged at the bottom, but there is still the moyo at the top. White has a weak group at F5.]
;W[dn]C[* You should extend further here. Your stones look a bit overconcentrated.]
(;B[gm]C[* A bit slow. Black should try a more dynamic play, for instance a move on the left side. The game would be difficult for White after this.]
;W[el]LB[di:A]C[* This shape looks a bit strange. Now the natural extension lies around D11, which looks high. Still, this is the right direction.]
;B[cf];W[io];B[in];W[jo];B[jn];W[ko]
(;B[fn]C[* This move does not really help Black. Pushing from behind once more looks good (because it reduces White's moyo), and then Black can go back to the left life, attacking White's group.]
;W[cj]LB[dk:A]TR[el]C[* I think you'd rather have these stones a bit lower. Also, this leaves a weakness at A (elephant's eye).]
