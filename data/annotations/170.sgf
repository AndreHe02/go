[qq]C[I have a preference here for P6 -- R3 isn't bad, but in a  handicap game
it is generally a good idea to cut white as often as is practical -- so
the play of P6 immediately seperates white into two groups.];W[pq];B[qp]
;W[po];B[rn];W[om];B[dj]C[In the sequence chosen in the LR corner, you have given  white outside thickness
in exchange for about 10 points and sente.  I think your best choice for next
move is one that reduces the value of whites thickness, and would prefer a  play on the bottom side -- I like either K3, K4 -- this is far enough from
white's thickness to not be too close, but close enough that white can't
extend as far as he would like.];W[gq]C[> How should this be answered?  Would  a pincer be better than e3?  the  > bottom looks huge for white, but what's teh best response?

This is an unusual Kakari -- probably white trying to throw you into
something you haven't seen before, where his strength will give even
more advantage.

The response that most strikes me is the pincer at K4, or possibly
J3.  I don't like K3, it seems to deep, without leaving enough room
for a comfortable two point jump to the right, and without putting
enough pressure on the G3 stone.  Other possibilities that come
to mind -- if you don't want to get into the fight that will,
inevitably, come from the pincer, are the one point jump to D6,  or the capping play at G5.  (C7 is probably also reasonable, but
it isn't my style.)  Even a play at F4 looks reasonable -- though
it may mutate into an attach&extend variant -- which is reasonable
for black.];B[eq]C[Part of the problem with this choice, is that it doesn't  effectively do any of the
things you want done here.  After white K3, his group is settled, and he has  also
made a perfect extension from his Q3 wall.  But black's corner is still not
settled, nor has black made a connecting move between the handicap stone and
the D10 stone -- both are important.  (More specifically, white can still  invade the corner and live, without badly harming the G3-K3 group, but black
hasn't really helped the strength of the D4 stone -- to properly close the
corner still takes at least on more (gote) move.  In fact, C3 might be a
far better choice than E3, and also playable -- it does a couple of things,
on it prevents white's G3 stone from living through a dive into the corner,
nor can white invade and live in the corner, the D4 stone now has something
very close to life, and any invasion/reduction on the left side (such as a
play at C6 by white) will also have a lot more difficulty -- black can pincer
immediately without worrying about white living through a dive into the  corner.

I guess I really didn't like E3... actually, G3 is non-threatening enough,
that tenuki is, even, a reasonable choice here... take that K16 point now.]
;W[jq];B[jd];W[qf]C[> again, shoule I pincer of do somethign else here. It  seems just like  > the bottom, gaining big areas on sides.   A pincer here is reasonable -- but remember the right side, unlike the
lower, is still open at the bottom -- you have some very good reducing
moves fromt he S7 stone -- T9 (monkey jump) can be very expensive, as
with S8 -- depending on the state of stones in the P9 area.  Also,
you have more influence on the upper and left side than white has in
the lower and right -- plus some territory in the LR corner.

So, O16 is not unreasonable here, Q14 is also a possibility.
Of course, a pincer is also, as you suggest, an emminently  reasonable possibility, probably low, to give the extra threat
of connection at S6 for life, in particular I think R11 is a  good point.]
;B[nd];W[rd];B[qi]C[Now that white has S16 played, this is probably  too deep -- you should look for
a lighter reducing play rather than a sever invasion.  Even one point less  deep
makes it far easier to escape, Q11 is far better.

To decide how far to invade, decide which white stones mark the "outposts"
of white's influence -- in this case they are P7 and R14.  Then draw an
imaginary line between them -- if your stone is below this line, then it
is probably a deep/severe invasion, and may get into trouble.  If it is
above the line, it is a shallow/light reduction.  Sitting right on the  line is the balance point -- and generally the hardest for white to deal
with.  (Why would you ever play a shallower move than neccessary -- well,
a shallow reduction is far more likely to end up with you finishing up
in sente which may (is) also important.  And you may not need the larger
reduction.

At this point in the game -- the simple response at R17 is also quite
playable.  If white doesn't follow up at Q11/R11/P14, then your invasion
at R11 looks very good (white can't settle the R15 group with the play
of R17) and you end up with sente, and a good chance of making territory
on the uppper side.  A play K10 after whites expected response of (say)
P14 looks like a lot of fun -- it looks at reducing moves on both the
lower (say K5 or L5) and right (P11, P12, Q11, or even Q9) and makes a
huge moyo (which won't survive in anything near its entirety) on the
whole upper left side of the board.  And it goes well with your influence
oriented choices on previous moves -- that is K16 and D10.];W[qc]
(;B[pg]C[Something looks fishy in the whole sequence after this -- for both black  and
white.  I don't like Q13, but can't quite put my finger on why.  I'd be more  inclined to play the light jump to O11.  Yes, white can cut off the R11 stone,
but you don't need that stone -- and if white tries to cut, you can generally
get a stone (connected) at either R9 or R13 -- both of which are equally  good
for reduction purposes and your concerns.  The usual "cut" sequence is shown
as a variation to the previous move.];W[pf];B[og];W[pj]C[This should probably  be a further push at P14 -- otherwise black connects too easily,
and even gets influence/thickness out of this whole thing.];B[of];W[qg]
;B[pi];W[qr];B[rr];W[qo];B[ro];W[pr];B[rs]C[> are there any wasted moves in  here?  Does it live with any less  > moves?

You can probably ignore the final connection at Q2 -- you still  have the threat of connecting out to the R11 stones, and that  should be enough to either get the connection, or to make a second
eye.  Of course, if you do ignore, then any move that cuts or threatens
to cut that connection will be sente.];W[df]C[(variations mentioned in comments  to move 34.)]

(;B[fd]C[> same as before.  If this were a kakari at c14,  I'd have contacted at  > c15, since d10 is there, but what about the high kakari?  Can I still  > contact t c or e 14 or is this best?

Again, I think white is playing something unusual to throw you into  unknown territory.  The high kakari is only, usually, played by white
if he has a lot of thickness opposite and wants to ensure that he comes
out with influence/outward facing stones, even at a small loss locally.

I think the best response to this is C14, and I follow some variations
on white responses to this move in the variations on move 33.  I'll look
at general variations, not just the one applicable to this situation.];W
[hc];B[gc]C[Before white played H17, there was a tenuous connection between the K16  and F16 stones.
Generally when white plays a move like this, it is best to play the move that  most tries
to maintain that connection.  In this case, that would mean playing H16.

White will probably live underneath -- or possibly force his way out, but  either
way you should end up with very good thickness here, which will be great for  dealing
with (capturing on a large scale) the D14 stone.

If white had played H16 himself (probably a more reasonable choice --  remember my
comments about invading, and drawing lines?), then black would have as his  first
two moves to look at H17 and H15.];W[hd];B[ff];W[hf];B[jf];W[eg];B[gg];W
[hg];B[gh];W[ie];B[je];W[ei];B[ej]C[I think I'd be more inclined to play D11  here, making any chance of a white base
very remote, and also it feels like better shape.];W[fi];B[hj]C[Too fancy.   You are running a splitting attack here -- keep you moves, especially the
cutting ones, solid and sound.  Don't risk one of your cutting stones getting  cut off,
or him escaping by making such a threat.  H12, H11, or G11 would all be  better choices.

Remember... there is no hurry to this fight, the longer you push him around,  all the  time running your stones and thickness towards his influence on the bottom  side, the
better it is for you.  You probably don't even need to kill either group,  just run
your stones all the way down to the bottom edge -- let both groups connect,  one to
the G3/K3 group, and the other to the Q5 group, but you've got your splitting  group
run through to N2, plus you've made territory on the left side.

Also, that corner is still not very sound -- a play at E17 could badly mess  with any
hope you have of making life, so the outside connection may be important for  your group
as well.    (As a side note, white should probably NOT have tried to run the D14 stone.   He should
have left it as a forcing move/weakness, and used the aji from it first, to  run out
the H17 group more easily, and after that, to make a successful corner  invasion --
probably at C17, but maybe at C16.)];W[gi];B[hi];W[hh];B[jh];W[gd];B[fc]
;W[fe];B[ee];W[ge];B[ef];W[gf];B[fg];W[dh];B[ib]C[Nice move, effectively  scooping white's base completely out from under him -- no chance
now of an eye at the bottom.];W[hb];B[jb];W[fj];B[el];W[gk];B[gj]C[> I don't  like this much, is there a better play?

Yes, this is very icky, and EXTREMELY greedy.

The white group at H16 is already dead, you just have to keep it that way.   You
can allow the white group at E11 to escape, because you will be able to keep  chasing it.  A far better choice, which solves most of your problems, connects
everything up, and leaves you in good shape for any more fighting, would be
K10.  After K10, The white group (at top) has no hope at all.  Whereas,  with this
play, you have reduced the liberties on you cutting stones without bringing  them
any closer to being connected to some sort of life.

Another move that also works well, instead of K10, is K9 -- it has many of the
same effects -- connecting the H11 stones to the rest.  The differences are  that
it strengthens the weakness at K13 a little more, but it isn't as effective  for
moving forward in your continued attack on the D14 group.];W[ii];B[ik]C
[This  should be H9 -- at least reduce the liberties on G9, then F9 will be atari.
Also, H9 means that none of the white follow ups are Ataris, so you will  probably
get to play the F9 (atari) and get your connection.];W[ij];B[hk];W[ih]C
[> fmaus 23k : heck of a combo

As I noted, you set yourself up for it with the play of J9 instead of H9  initially.]

Without a move here, your cutting stones are beginning to look awfully
isolated... there begins to be a noticeable risk that, with cutting
points at M9 and K9, that one of the outside (cutting) groups will  itself be cutoff and killed.  The choice of best move here is definitely
unclear, but this one is quite a reasonable choice -- it connects the
M11 group solidly to life, and prevents any hope of either escape, or
reduction through that gap -- maybe not succeeding in connecting to
the M12 stones, but still cutting off the Q11 stones instead.  Other
possible choices here include M9, M8, N9, K8, K9, and even maybe L8.

With a bit more looking at some of the sequences, a play at M9 seems
to allow the white group at H18 to connect, but black cuts off the F11
group (in sente) and gets very good thickness along the outside.  A play
at M8 seems to connect everything nicely -- the M9 cutting point is the
most dangerous weakness.

The choice of O11, while not horrible, gets into trouble if white
chooses M9 as his next play.  I'll follow some of the problems and
show how black ends up in trouble in the variation.]
(;W[mi];B[mj];W[jk];B[jl];W[jj];B[ll]C[> Is there a better way to protect these cutting points?  > At least here I didn't do that, but it may not be best method.

This actually does look like the best choice for protecting your cutting
points.  There is one still open -- at J8, but it isn't important, because
H8, J7, H8... connects up in the other direction.];W[mf];B[ne]C[> do I need  to worry about w connection through here?  Is there a  > better way?

White isn't going to be able to connect through to the right side here, and  he can't even cut the P14 stone off from one of the O16 or Q16 stones --  though you might lose one.

A more dangerous threat, should you ignore, is a jump to somewhere in the  M16/M17/L17 area -- threatening to cut off and capture the black K16 and/or
K18 groups.  O15 is probably enough to render that threat harmless, and it
covers the P15 weakness as well, but there might still be complications after
white M16 -- so a play in that direction would probably have been better here.
O18 (with the secondary benefit of reducing the value of white P18) is one  possibility, as are O17, N16, and M16.]

;W[kg];B[ld];W[gl];B[il];W[en];B[dm]C[D7  is not sufficient to connect the D4 group to the E8/D10 group.  White can  still
cut here with a simple push sequence -- D6, C6, C5, C7, D5.

C7 is much closer to being connected -- it gets more complicated, there are a  lot
more branches, and the stone at E8 may be lost, but it should end up being a  connection.]

In general, this is only useful if white has to play the hane on his side of
the stone -- you then gain more territory, since you get to play the pull
back (to C11).  This tends to be true if white is fairly weak, or doesn't
have support near -- or if there is a trap.  Generally, the move played is
the diagonal one (in this case C11), or sometimes the knights-move to B11.

But, at this point in the game there is a far more important concern for
black than a play on this side (though this is important as well) but
the black UL corner may not be alive.  Consider the complications that
arise starting as shown in variation 1.]

Pushes like this are good as long as they are sente... if he has to respond,
it is good.  Generally anything that threatens to cut off a larger piece, or
to massively reduce, is worth playing... or later, all it has to do is  threaten
to make more points than any other move is worth to be sente.];W[lo];B[mn]
C[By  connecting with N7, instead of N6, you would have prevented the escape of the  two  white stones -- and, in this case, whether or not the N5 stone can be put  into atari
(after the black hane at N4) is irrelevant.  In other situations, where you  may want
the relevant move to be non-forcing, the solid connection is to be  preferred.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[np];B[pl];W[ol];B[pk];W[ob];B[oo]C[> I'm  assuming that the threat to the p7 group is more important than  > continuing with p18 for white, is that correct?   The following analysis is not actually valid, because of black N13, capturing
3 stones and connecting. but if we assume that those can't be captured,
the follow is true, and the general principles espoused are well worth
looking at.  Since white doesn't have a truly sente follow-up at the top
(or I don't think white does), then Q6 is probably bigger.

But A16 is probably bigger than Q6, and S12 may also be.

****

This is a fairly complicated question, but the answer (though not obvious)
is no.  As long as white can either finish with sente to his followup to
P18, or come out in gote, but with more points than Q6 is worth, he should
play the follow up to P18.

So, to decide, we first have to decide on the value of Q16 -- it works
out to about 15 points (in gote, of course).  The calculation is as  follows:
   3 captured stones - 6
   6 points around stones that will be territory = 6
   N7 gote follow up worth 6pts x 1/2 = 3
   Total: 15
(N7 is worth a touch under 3 actually, but there are other pushes worth about
a point as well.  15 is a good number for this.)
      In variation 1, I follow the monkey jump to M19 -- black has the tesuji  threat
at Q18 to cut off the M19 stone, but white still finishes in sente because of  the
ability to cut of the black M16/N17/K18 group and kill it.

  In variation 2, I follow the simpler follow-up of O17 -- now black can't cut
white off, and simply has to make life, allowing white to go back and connect  at
Q6.   
  In fact, white should play any move that threatens to make more than 15  points
now (and is sente, of course.)  For instance, A16 can also be played.]
(;W[pn];B[nb];W[oc];B[pc];W[pb];B[od]C[If you are going to make a move  locally, N13 is much preferred.  Both moves are gote,

much smaller.];W[nf];B[qd];W[rc];B[bh]C[> I think this is big boo boo. b 10  still better?

;W[ah];B[gr]C[> Here amongst this endgame stuff, are there better/bigger points I'm  > missing?

Endgames, despite being the simplest part of Go (and they have been,  effectively,
solved) are still complicated.

The first, and most important, consideration in deciding what moves to play  is  sente.  One can't just look at the first move, and say does my opponent have  to
respond?  One has to look at the complete sequence -- in this case, white will
respond to G2, but black will then have to play another move.  Black also has
to be careful because of the weakness at E4 -- on thing that is often an  option
in this sort of situation is to play the descent to F2 (threatening a monkey  jump)
which is more likely to be sente than the hane -- it does give up a point or  so,
but as long as the remaining moves are worth more than 1 point, giving up one  point
for sente is worth it.

But, in general, one should look for and play moves in the order: sente for  both players,  sente for me, sente for him, gote.

Or, another way of looking at it, take the value of any move, if it is  double-sente,
multiple it be 4; if it is my sente or his sente, multiply by 2, and if it is  gote
multiply it by 1.  Also, when deciding sente, you have to determine not just  the size
of the move, but the size of the threat -- a 1 point sente move, where the  threat is
worth 30 points should be played before a 4 point reverse sente move with  only a 6pt
threat.

The single biggest move on the board right now (for either player, since it  is big
double sente) is S12.

After S12, the biggest move for black is O17 -- this move is sente for white  (threatens
to kill the black group at M16, etc) and makes the play of R15 sente for  white as well.
Whereas, for black, it allows R15 (in sente) for black, and also makes P19  sente for
black.  Very big.  (Of course, R15 shouldn't be played until after S12.)

Other big points are A16 (reverse sente) P4 (sente) and Q7 (reverse  sente).]

sequence by playing on the other side of the white stones -- Q12 and P12  instead
of Q10 and P10.  Note also, white still needs another move -- probably the  capture
at R12, else R12 by black threatens P12 capture, S12 capture.];W[qh])
(;W[ph]C[The "obvious" move here for black is Q11 -- but white intends to  follow up
with P11 and black has to read out the resulting, and decide which side (if
either) the atari will work on.  This will often come out reasonably well.

A couple other possibilities -- also requiring reading -- are P10, P11,
and Q10.]
