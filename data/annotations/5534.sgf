C[Hello reviewer, I am an 11k on KGS, as is my opponent during this game. Black seemed to have an advantage after the initial opening fight in this game, but the main question was how to exploit that advantage effectively.]

;B[pp];W[dd];B[fq];W[dn];B[iq];W[qn];B[ql];W[pn]C[White's move here seems very slow, but I didn't know how to profit off of it. any suggestions?]
;B[no];W[ol];B[pj];W[qp];B[qq];W[qg]C[This is not a good continuation with the main white
group still unsettled.  Black's natural continuation
will put pressure on the white corner group, which is not
advantageous for white.];B[om]LB[nj:A]C[I tried cutting here to relieve some of the pressure from my R8 group.

I think this is an overplay, and is bound to result in
a big fight.  Just escaping into the center wil put
pressure on both white groups, and leave the black
group in good shape.];W[pm];B[pl]C[
Now both black and white have bad shape and too
little eye potential.];W[nl];B[nn];W[po];B[rp]C[My move here seems a little slow, but it's hard to see any good moves here. Perhaps O10 or P10?]

position collapses];W[nm];B[on];W[oj];B[oi]LB[oo:A]C[
it's not really necessary or wise to always play contact.  You
leave yourself as many weak points as you create for your
opponent. 

In a situation like this, even if white survives he will have no
territory and terrible shape.  It's not necessary to go immediately
for the kill.  Better is to give yourself good shape.

The cutting point at A is still the key.   If white is cut
at A, he has a dead group and 2 weak groups. Whereas
black has no problems.];W[mj];B[nk];W[mk];B[ok];W[ml];B[nj]
;W[kl];B[jm]C[It seem here that black has an advantage, as white's large cluster still is not completely alive, but I didn't see how to take advantage of that fact during the game.]
;W[lk];B[oo];W[ko]LB[kp:A][lr:B]C[this is not a good play for white.  Black will connect, then white
will have a new cutting point to defend at A.  White's position
is can be completely undercut at B]
(;B[rn]C[this is a mistake as it gives white an unnecessary sente.
Black should just connect immediately, see variation.];W[mp]
;B[kn];W[jp];B[kr];W[lr];B[oq]C[
while this is locally advantageous, it's not the big move.]
;W[or];B[pr];W[nq]
(;B[cj]C[Seemed to be a rather large move on the board, but thinking back a move around K16 would have probably been better.

White is so weak,  L3 and J4 might kill him, and would
certainly solidify black's bottom group while leaving
white with a big problem to solve.

Either way, getting on with the actual game instead of fighting
is a good idea.];W[jr];B[ir];W[er];B[eq];W[dq]C[now white is almost alive, and black is very shakey.]
;B[fr];W[cr];B[ho];W[kq];B[cm];W[nc];B[of];W[pe];B[oe];W[od]

(;B[qc]LB[pc:B][qd:A]C[this is too passive, white gets to push black around
and maybe live.  A or B are both better, but A is best.

A single stone always needs help - leaving your opponent
2 ways to choose how to atari it is not a good idea.];W[qd]
;B[pc];W[rd];B[oc];W[nd];B[rc];W[pf];B[og];W[qi];B[pg];W[qf]
;B[qj];W[jd]C[white lives and has a good position on the side.  Not
a good outcome for black.

Good move for white.];B[gd]C[had to attack white's increasingly powerful upper side before he gained an advantage.]
;W[dg]
(;B[bh]C[This is a change in direction which I think is a mistake.
You started attending to white's top side (good) so why
switch to this side.  Black still has enough potential to
live on the left without this move, and in doing so will
prevent any big territory forming.  

Black should continue on the top, and try not the weaken the
left in the meantime.];W[bg]
(;B[cf]C[this seems like an unwise attack.  Black's center left 
group is already weak, and the center top isn't
even a group.   Starting a fight this way will not improve 
either.     On the other hand, white's lower
left corner is weak and pressing in that direction will
help black and reduce white.

There are lots of variations, too hard for me to really
read, But I think black's invasion most likely should
fail outright if started this way.  Other invasion scenarios
are possible, but the best choice is to not invade.

Look at it this way: you'll both make mistakes,
the outcome is a tossup.  Much better to just play solidly
and guarantee a good result, even if it's not spectacular.]

Summary: Don't start fights just for the sake of fighting.
A fight should be where you can definitely see a profit,
not a roll of the dice where you might either win or lose 
hugely.

Stretching for the last possible point is frequently
inferior to playing a solid connection.  Every opportunity
for your opponent to atari something gives him 2 more
ways to push you around to his advantage.

Pay attention to the overall stability of each area.  You don't
need eyes that you can count, but you do need potential for
twice as many eyes as you can't count on yet.])
