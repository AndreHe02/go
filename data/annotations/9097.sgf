C[Hi,
Thanks for taking some time to review my game.

It was a close game -- hoping for opening/middle game pointers.

I played black and lost by 0.5

Reviewer: Hi. I'll call myself Rev.];B[pd];W[dd];B[cp];W[pq]
;B[qo];W[op]C[Rev: Too slow for a 0.5-komi game.];B[qj];W[ep]
;B[eq];W[fq];B[dq];W[gp];B[cn];W[kq];B[pn]C[Rev: Seems slow, but I like this move because it simplifies the
game.];W[nn];B[rq]C[Is this too early? Are there bigger opening points?

Rev: This reduces the severity of White's moves on the right
side and creates bad aji in White's lower side. I also like this
move.];W[fm]
(;B[dk]LB[ci:A]C[This seemed strange... it kind of achieves nothing .. since white
can play at A so happily...
I was worried about white expanding his moyo so i played here
anyways...
Any ideas on a better move for black here?

Rev: Depend on your style. This can be viewed as a preparing
move before Black does something on the lower side. On the other
hand, the left side is not that big.];W[nc];B[pf];W[pb];B[qc]
;W[kc];B[cf];W[fd];B[fk]C[Also unsure of direction here...

Rev: Nice one. It is a focal point, enlarging Black while suppressing
White.]
(;W[ch]C[Rev: Your chance to win this game. Too unreasonable.]
;B[ef];W[eh];B[gf];W[ej];B[ek];W[gi];B[if];W[hc];B[ii]C[Rev: Nice attacking sequence.]
;W[hj];B[jk]C[Rev: Good direction. How could you lose?];W[hl]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[nd]C[Rev: Now isn't this an ideal textbook example of attacking?]
;W[oc];B[jm]C[Mistake? - this lets white enter moyo... but i wanted to prevent
his big moyo... couldn't decide which was better..

Rev: Do you count during the game? That really helps. Just by
looking at the shape, Black is leading a lot, so keeping White
small should be enough (Black moyo is just a bonus). Also, this
keeps White thin around here.];W[kl];B[jl];W[oj]C[Rev: A painful gamble. White doesn't have much choice.]

(;B[hm]C[Rev: Nice idea, but attacking by attaching seems a contradiction
to the Go principle.];W[gl];B[hq]C[Rev: Excellent.];W[hp];B[iq]
;W[ip];B[fr]C[Rev: Now White's winning is really unimaginable.]
;W[qi]C[Handling this is complicated... Wondering if you have any ideas
on how to best handle -- the way i played was kind of easy for
white...

Rev: Your attacking is OK, but it is really complicated.];B[pi]

;W[nh];B[of];W[ng];B[rf];W[rg];B[lf];W[ni]
(;B[nj]C[Rev: This is the first really dubious move by Black in the game.
Why on earth do you want to capture the two stones?];W[mj];B[nk]
;W[li];B[ml];W[jh]
(;B[jg]C[Rev: Bad style (except that you read it all). In retrospect,
this seems like the losing move.];W[kg];B[kf];W[ih];B[kh];W[ki]
C[Rev: Now Black is attacked instead!];B[lm];W[bd]LB[bd:A][cj:B]
C[You can end comments after here -- i understand my big mistakes
after this point -- mostly i missed the big endgame at A and
B --

THANKS

That should be enough to win.]))

knight move on the left, vital point at H3, bad aji on the right,
etc.); however, reading is important here.]))
