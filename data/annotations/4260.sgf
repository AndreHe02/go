C[Hi. A game played on KGS. I've written some comments and questions but anything you can think of would be really appriciated. I'm playing black. Thank you for taking the time to review this game.
-Max

hello Max, my name is Gius, so you'll find my comments introduced by a "gius:"]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pp];W[dp];B[oc];W[qn]
(;B[qj]C[I don't know if this is close enough to be classed as a pincher, but i was thinking that it could work nicely as a dual purpose move for extending and putting som pressure on the white stone. Was this the right course of action?

gius: r10 can be called a pincer, for me it is a good move]
;W[qp];B[qq]C[I'm a bit unsure if this is the right response

gius: i think r3 is correct];W[ql]
(;B[po]C[gius: this q5 is very problematic for me];W[qo];B[kp]
TR[qn][po]C[At this point i had no clue what to do. i was thinking of continuing with Q6 and then play this. But for some reason didnt do it. So  comments on what would have been right to do at this point are very welcome

gius: after q5, l4 seems correct, but there is something strange

supposing white local continuations instead of direct f3, q5 and consequent l4 seem more and more doubtful

very difficult :-)]
(;W[fq];B[fc];W[dc];B[jd];W[hd]C[Whats the correct way to react to this white stone?

gius: i would consider f17 a light stone and leave it for aji]

(;W[cf]C[I was doubting that white would be alive, but decided it can wait a little while.

gius: yes, white could not tenuki];B[he];W[dk]
(;B[dg]C[I tried to close white into his side, was this a correct move?

Thanks.

(;B[nq]C[gius: here you can see that q5/l4 was a strange sequence]
)))
(;B[ci]C[gius: with an invasion, with the bad moves of white on the right and the option to kill the white top group i think black has strong chances to win

i stop my comments here, with a possible follow up for black

have good games!
