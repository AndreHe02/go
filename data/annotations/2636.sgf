C[Hi there. Thank you for reviewing my game. I would be Haley, 27k on IGS - Playing as white

Hello Haley, blitz games aren't wat u should be sending in for review, for they do not reflect your best games, and does not show the real mistakes u normally would make, try to remember that next time, i just showed a couple variations]

(;W[ni]C[This move was a mistake. I made it because I had only a few seconds left with my time (I think it was 7 seconds left with 3 moves to go). Should've played at N11 instead, but wrongly clicked since I was rushing]
;B[mi]C[N10, still gives black a good position]
(;W[lh]C[Another rushed move that was a mistake. Had 4-5 seconds left I think. Should've played at N10 I think]
;B[mj]SQ[ni][nj][oj][pj]C[The group marked is dead thanks to that mistake. Now I hasve no chance of damaging his clusters on the right side as easily anymore.]
;W[li]C[Had 1 or 2 seconds left with this move... Just clicked whereever I was nearest to. No point in this move really, except to not lose by time]
;B[lk];W[kk];B[qe];W[pd];B[gp];W[jd]C[that move accomplishes nothing]

;B[ed];W[cc];B[dc];W[db];B[cd];W[bc];B[bd];W[ad];B[ae]C[Here, it caused me all. My internet got disconnected]
;W[ac]C[It was an obvious followup move to A16. But my opponent denied it and accused me of cheating by forcing a disconnect. When I asked for additional time, he/she persistantly said that I only had a few seconds left (17 seconds for 5 moves) when I 'officially' got disconnected from IGS. The truth is, I've clicked on A17 when I had 5 minutes 34 seconds left but because of the lag before disconnect, followed by a disconnection, IGS only timed my 'ghost' out after 5 minutes or so. I asked for 5 minutes, but my opponent said he/she will add 2 minutes for me. So I said 2 minutes is fine too.. but he/she did not even add 2 minutes]
;B[be];C[After this move, I had about 17 seconds left. He did not add my time like he promised. So I had to deal with it. Unfortunately, my connection problems hit me again - I was lagged. I can just look as the 17 seconds I had left count down to 0. And look at a popup that I've ran out of time come out a minute later or so.

Anyway, I think I played the game pretty okay, since I tried some new type of moves and strategies that I don't usually play and they worked out pretty well. If only the game wasn't ruined by my opponent's hunger for points and don't want to continue the game...]
