C[Dear Reviewer!

I am Bernd Sambale, HonFu on KGS and in the ladder.

In this game my opponent gave ne line-of-victory territory, then invaded so that I didn't get much of it. I was able to counter by separating his groups, isolating his wall, surround it and make it struggle for life, building outward influence. But still, he lived and countered it in a way that gave him an insurmountable lead.

I applied two proverbs I know and still lost bad, so I'd be glad if you showed me where my whole-board-view was wrong, how the position really was to judge, which principles I should have applied, and what the directions of play were.

Thank you very much!

-H-: Hello, I am your reviewer, Svante v. Erichsen.

It is always nice if you can just do what a proverb tells you and win. However, things are not always simple. If you find that your opponent's strategy was unreasonable but he still won, then either his strategy has some merit that you don't understand or you made some serious mistakes in your counter-strategy.]
;B[pc]C[-H-: I know that this is not relevant to the game itself, but usually this komoku is played at R16. The general principle is to play in the octant spanned by K10-T19-T10. This is not always adhered to, especially with mokuhazushi and takamoku.]
;W[po];B[qe];W[dp];B[dd];W[cf]C[-H-: Breaking up the upper side at K17 is also a possibility for White.]
;B[fd]
(;W[ef]C[-H-: This is very unusual. White should first build a base before jumping to the centre.]
;B[ck]C[-H-: I think that this is good. E14 provokes a fight, but Black has nothing to fear.]

(;W[cn]C[-H-: A better plan for White might be to extend from the other side (see variation).]
;B[ch];W[bd];B[cc];W[gf]
(;B[hd]C[-H-: Since Black doesn't want his left side stones to become too weak, he should perhaps try to give White no further forcing moves. Therefore, completing the shape with J17 might be better.]
;W[if];B[fg]C[-H-: You should not deceive yourself into thinking that this peep removes all sorrow for your left side group. White also becomes stronger.]
;W[ff];B[jd];W[lc]C[-H-: This looks a bit unreasonable. However, White has possibilities to build a base for this stones with K18 and/or P17, and the centre group has also become a bit stable, so it is difficult to find an obvious way to profit from this for Black. Of course, separation is essential.]
;B[kc]C[-H-: OK, you deny White the easy base he would achieve by sliding to K18. You have to keep in mind the weak point at J17, though.]
;W[ld]
(;B[jf];W[ie];B[je];W[ic];B[id];W[kb]C[-H-: Black might feel a little outplayed now, but I think that actually, the result is not too bad for him. White had to take gote to stabilize the top side group, and his groups are solidly separated now while Black is solidly connected out between the white groups.]
;B[ih]C[-H-: Yes, bending around at J13 would be bad, because the J14-J15 stones are not worth anything. You could also try to cast your net a bit more loosely with J11.]
;W[fi];B[ek]
(;W[gg]
(;B[bc]C[-H-: I think that I would rather try to enclose White from the outside, perhaps H9.

So far, White has only established two almost living groups but no territory or thickness on the top side. Your main goal now is making your stones as thick as possible, so that you have a better starting position for the fight on the lower side than White had for the upper side.]

(;W[be]C[-H-: White definitely should not answer here. Instead, getting out in the centre is essential.]
;B[gk]C[-H-: Good.];W[hi];B[ik]C[-H-: This is great for Black.]
;W[hj];B[hk];W[jj]
(;B[ig]C[-H-: Black only tries to capture unimportant stones. Better cut through J10 directly (see variation).]

(;W[ge]C[-H-: This helps Black more than White.]
(;B[gd]C[-H-: Black should play H17 instead, weakening the top side white group while building territory.]

(;W[hb]C[-H-: Too slow. White needs K11.];B[ij]C[-H-: Good for Black.]
;W[ii];B[ji];W[jh];B[ki];W[fj];B[fk]C[-H-: Good for Black.]
;W[dj]
(;B[cj]C[-H-: Your first instinct should be to connect at D9 now (see variation).]
;W[dk]
(;B[ej]C[-H-: Blocking D8 is essential. These poking moves have no worth, and only help White.]
;W[di];B[ei];W[dh]
(;B[ci]C[-H-: Oh no! You didn't look at the whole board at all!]
;W[dl]C[-H-: Very, very bad for Black. The side group isn't even completely alive while White is solidly connected out between your stones.

I am tempted to say "game over" now.];B[cl];W[cm];B[cg];W[dg]
;B[bm];W[bn];B[al];W[bg];B[bk];W[bh];B[bi];W[kk];B[de]C[-H-: This has no worth. Do you think that White would play here? The white group is completely secure. You just lose a potential ko threat.]
;W[df];B[fh]C[-H-: This even loses the precious sente that would have been so useful for securing the J9 group. Did you count on his mistake?]
;W[hh]
(;B[jg]C[-H-: This doesn't capture the cutting stone.]
(;W[km];B[in];W[ko];B[fo];W[fq];B[ip];W[an];B[am];W[kq];B[eh]
C[-H-: This is an endgame gote move of about 5 points worth. It seems that the black group is alive, so you could just take some big point on the right side or corner.]

(;W[fm];B[em]
(;W[el];B[fl];W[en];B[gm];W[fn];B[gn]
(;W[gp]C[-H-: Enclosing the lower right corner is bigger than this.]
;B[go];W[hp];B[jl];W[kl];B[ho];W[iq];B[jp];W[jq]C[-H-: It is a bit ridiculous that Black lives in sente. At least, White has some territory to show for it, but taking the lower right corner would have been better.]
;B[pq]

[hm][hn][qq][rq][sq][pr][rr][sr][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[-H-: Black made a series of meaningless moves, while allowing White out at D8, and also after that, at E12 and F12. After that, any black move had no impact on White's stones.

Connection is important! White has only one group on the whole board, while Black has 4 (or 5, because the connection at k10 happened only during the endgame when all groups already were secure).]

(;B[dk]C[-H-: This is what thickness is about. You don't want any more cuts in your wall. This has a significant impact on any framework White would want to build at the lower side. It is much more powerful than trying to save the handful of points around B12.]
