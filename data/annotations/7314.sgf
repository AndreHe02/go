;W[nd];B[of];W[oe];B[pe];W[nf];B[og];W[pb];B[qc];W[gc]C[Black's next move is in the wrong place IMO.  I think it would have been wiser to reinforce the K group more, possibly with K18 or N18.]
;B[dg];W[ge];B[hc]C[I don't like this contact move by black.  It's rarely a good idea to play a contact move, only reasonable when youhave a good reason for it.  Here the move is gote, so it's quite bad.  You have to learn that to pressure stones, you should do it from further away - K14 for instance if you want to pressure the left group only, or L14 to pressure both.]
;W[hd];B[ic];W[gb];B[mb];W[oc]C[The next move by black is very bad.  This white group is not enclosed yet.  it's futile to try to kill a group that is not enclosed.  Your black group is weak, so your next move has to be L13 or nearby, to strengthen your group and separate white's two weak groups.]
;B[nb];W[ng];B[oq];W[oh];B[ph];W[pg];B[pf];W[pi];B[qh];W[qi]
;B[qg];W[ri];B[nh]C[This move isn't good.  You are creating a situation where you now have two weak groups (your upper group and your new O12 group) - but white's groups that you have split are not weak.  Don't try to split groups if they aren't weak, in general.]
;W[oi];B[mh];W[lf];B[me]C[looks clever, but your position is not strong enough to stop white. Correct move would have been K14.]
;W[ne];B[mf];W[mg];B[lg];W[lh]
(;B[li];W[kg];B[le];W[mi]C[As you can see, this is total disaster for black.  Black still has a weak group at the top and in the bottom right, white is fully connected and his weakest group at G18 is not very weak.  It would take a miracle for black to win now.  The game is basically over. Black is 50+ points behind.]
;B[pn]C[Apparently, you are trying to create the miracle.  But this is unlikely to work.  You are setting up your stones to be split into two weak groups again.  Remember, it's impossible to attack R11 because it's 100% alive.  You need to "play away from stength" - in this case, something around M4,L4 would be correct.]
;W[op];B[qq]C[You have to break the habit of these contact moves.  These stones are in terrible shape.  You are setting yourself up to be cut again and again. *KEEP YOUR STONES CONNECTED*]

You were luckythat your two groups on right lived, and that one of them even is entering the center.  White made some big mistakes.  don't count on that luck against a better player.  I think your opponent wasn't paying attention. In any case, now you need to immediately reduce white's possibilities in the bottom center.  It's far bigger than the tiny move in the upper left.]
