C[Comments by Erik Ekholm, Swedish 3 dan, for the GTL, Dec 99.


Hi Erick,

Thank you very much for the rapidity of your review. I completly agree with you: central territory is too hard to defend! But sometimes I can't help trying...

I would like to see a variation on move 99.
See you at move 98.

Thanks again, Nicolas.];B[qd]C[Hi,
I play white in this game.
At move 62, I decided to make some central territory. Was it a bad strategy?

EE: It is always hard to make points in the centre. Here, he had too many
ways to get in to your moyo.


I think I should have lost this game. Where did it happend?

All comments and variations are welcome.

Many thanks,

Nicolas.];W[dd];B[pp];W[dq];B[co];W[dl];B[bl]C[Nick: I feel 7(B8) it's not a good move. How to deal with it?

EE: B8 is low and fails to separate White. Maybe you can play like the variation?]

(;W[fp]C[EE: This is ok too.];B[ck];W[cp]C[EE: This is a move to attack c5, but it is a light stone:
you can't expect to make much territory by capturing it since b8 and c9 are in place.

You could ignore him and play O3 or P16.];B[bp];W[bq];B[bo]
C[EE: Since he let you have sente here, C4 didn't turn out too bad.]
;W[od]C[EE: ok];B[pf];W[qc];B[rc];W[pc];B[re];W[kc];B[hq];W[do]
C[EE: Good shape, but pincering directly was also possible.]
;B[cm]C[Nick: I balanced between L3 and O3...

EE: L3 is much better, you should use your thickness to pincer him.
BTW, Black has played many low moves here. That gives D8 a kikashi feeling,
so you can treat it lightly.];W[nq];B[kq]C[EE: This is ideal for Black, now your thickness is useless.]
;W[qq]C[EE: ok.];B[pq];W[qp];B[po];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[oq];W[qn]
;B[qk]C[EE: misses the vital point R8!];W[ch]C[EE: Don't approach solid groups! Very bad! This is no threat to C9. If you play
C14 instead, invading top left is much harder for Black.];B[ic]
;W[ke];B[fc];W[db]C[EE: Exchanging E17 for F16 instead, to make him overconcentrated, is a popular plan.]
;B[ce];W[fd]C[Nick: Here, reinforce my opponent...

EE: Leaning attack, looks interesting.];B[gd];W[fe];B[df];W[ec]
;B[fb];W[eh]C[EE: E13 is the usual move in this shape, but here, it might be an
overplay. E12 is very good in any case.];B[ie];W[fg];B[bi];W[bh]
;B[rl];W[pn];B[on]
(;W[om]C[EE: You have bad aji, see variations.]
(;B[nn];W[pl]C[EE: Good.];B[oj];W[dm]C[EE: Not big. How about O14, on the border of two opposing areas? Then it would be
a close game. Or if you want to do something about the centre, press him
flat at K4 or J4.];B[go];W[gm]C[EE: This makes no contribution to White's position, and fails to
reduce Black. You have to go in deeper: J5 with a threat to cut, perhaps?
White's can't expect much in the centre. Black can come in with E10,
J13 or from P10 or P6.];B[hn]C[EE: Now you see how bad the last white move was.]
;W[il];B[jm];W[ig];B[jf];W[oh];B[ph];W[of];B[og];W[ng];B[pg]
;W[nh]C[EE: Saving P12 is not very big, and you leave a lot of bad aji behind, so
better connect on the other side.];B[oe];W[nf];B[ne];W[nd];B[me]
;W[md];B[le];W[ld]C[Nick: this sequence is brutal... Anything else to do?]
;B[jb];W[kh];B[pe];W[lm]C[EE: Neat move!];B[ln];W[jl];B[km]
;W[kl];B[mm];W[ll];B[ej];W[dj]C[EE: Since, as we saw, D11 appears to be Black's sente,
I have to retract the praise I gave this move (which usually is
a tesuji in this shape). White will probably have to play F10 instead.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[di];W[fj]C[Here we are. What about this var?]

(;B[ci];W[dh];B[ei];W[fi];B[kf];W[kb]C[EE: It seems you'd better answer L14. At O10?]
;B[lh];W[kg]C[Nick:106 is not a good move...

EE: No. It is hard to use a moyo strategy, if you have a weak group to
look after (O12).];B[lg];W[li];B[mi];W[nj];B[ni];W[mj];B[oi]
;W[gr];B[hr];W[fr]C[EE: A11 is bigger.];B[fo];W[ai];B[bj];W[rb]
;B[ro];W[qo];B[rn];W[sc];B[rd];W[ml];B[nm];W[nl];B[jg];W[jh]

terrible for White, so White can't play F10 in the first place. Thus
