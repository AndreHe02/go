AB[dd][pd][dj][pj][dp][pp]C[J: Hi mz name is J. I wanted to know where I can improve my game. I would be very gratefull I you could take a look.

Ted: My name is Ted Schuerzinger, and all my comments will be preceded by my name.

I think the biggest problem you seem to be having is one of not being able to identify cutting points properly.  This led you to play some unneccessary defensive moves and try some attacks that wouldn't work.  At the same time, you missed some big splitting moves.  If you have GnuGo or one of the other free go programs, you might want to try playing some 9x9 games.  I find they're very good practice for keeping track of what can and can't be cut.  :-)]
;W[nc];B[qf];W[oe];B[qe]C[Ted: This move is unnecessary right now -- you don't have to worry about White playing at R15 yet.  If you want to play conservatively, try something like Q17.  But I think it might be better to play more aggressively with something like J17 or K17.]
;W[pc];B[od];W[nd]
(;B[qc]C[Ted: Splitting the White stones with P17 looks better here.  See a sample variation.]
;W[oc];B[ne];W[me];B[nf];W[nh];B[mf];W[ld];B[le];W[kd];B[ke]
;W[lg];B[jd]C[J: Was there any way to restrict white here and maybe kill the group.

Ted: White's already got too much room at the top to make two eyes.  You should look to make your opponent get a small life, while you get a bigger life.  This move leaves cutting points at K15 and M14, but because of the aji you still have in being able to capture at N16, it should help you limit White to a small life at the top.

Having said that, however, White made a mistake later on that probably would have allowed you to kill the group had you responded correctly.]
;W[lf];B[md];W[og]
(;B[of]C[Ted: White erred in his last move by playing at P13.  You should have continued here with an extension at N17, splitting White in two.  Let White save the P15 stone.

I've included a few variations.];W[mc];B[lc]C[Ted: I think the simpler K17 would be a good idea here.  It forces White to respond, and should give you sente.]
;W[kc];B[jc];W[kb];B[me];W[je];B[hd];W[nq];B[qn];W[pr];B[qq]
;W[jp];B[np]C[Ted: I'm not so sure about this move.  It doesn't restrict White's territory that much.  I'd try something bigger on the left side.  Possibly F3, C7, or C3.]
;W[mq]C[J: White ends up with the whole side. Would it have been a good idea to have extended from D4 and let white extend to the centre?

Ted: Yes, I think so.];B[mp];W[pl];B[qh];W[oj];B[pk];W[ok];B[ql]
;W[ol];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[fq];B[cn];W[qk];B[qm]C[Ted: I think you should have played at R10 here.]

[np]C[J: At this point I felt like I needed some influence in the centre. Would it have been better to have tried to solidify the sides?

Ted: I think that your stones in the bottom right (the marked stones) are doing a good job of getting you influence in the center.  So, something on the side might be a good idea here.  As for which side is the biggest, I think I'd play at E3.  White really has to respond to this, and you should get sente, which you should use to shore up your group at the top.  Watch out for a possible White hane at either G17 or E17.]

;W[ln];B[lo];W[bj];B[di];W[dh]C[J: There semms to be a lot of gaps in whites defence. I think I became to concerned with connecting my groups. Where are the best pionts to try and attack white?

Ted: To be honest, I'm not so certain you need to attack White right now.  If you can shore up your weaknesses at the top and get to play E3 first, you should have a fighting chance.]
;B[de]C[Ted: Not a bad idea, but I think E3 is more important right now.]
;W[cf];B[df];W[ec]C[Ted: Now you're in some trouble.];B[ed]
;W[gc];B[dc];W[eb];B[fe];W[hc];B[gd];W[id];B[jf]C[Ted: The wrong atari.  J15 is a double atari.]
;W[ie];B[ib]C[Ted: I think you should have played K18 instead, since it threatens M18.  Then, follow it up with F18.

Basically, this sacrifices the three stones at K17 in order to capture the E17/E18 stones and take the top left corner.]

(;B[do]C[J: Whwt could I have done to better protect the corner in this situation? Could I have left the white group alone assuming I could kill it later?

As I mentioned earlier, E3 was the key point, preventing White from invading from that direction.]

(;B[gl]C[Ted: I don't believe this move is necessary.  I'd suggest splitting the White stones by playing C4.]

Ted: There is no attack for Black here.  Note that the stone at E12 is in atari, and should be able to get two eyes on the side even if E12 turns out to be a false eye.]
