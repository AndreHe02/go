C[Hi!
I would like to get a comment on this game, particularly about how could I have better put to use the huge walls I got on the right, regarding the fight in the center/right of the board (around move 45).
Also, while reviewing it with my opponent, we were wondering what could have happened if the group around L10 would have run away before engaging the fight towards the upper side (around move 85).


Hello.  Thank you for letting me review your game.  As you remark the dominating feature in this game was white's strong position on the right side.  Black made a far too deep invasion and should expect to be killed.  When instead he is able to kill a large group of white's stone the game is pretty much over.
I am using cgoban2 to edit this game and will end my comments with

;W[ef]C[I do not think this is a good move.  There is still a weakness in the white structure, and black gets the oppertunity to close the corner.
The main feature to bear in mind regarding a 3 space extension against the corner is that you in general have the option of entering the corner so you can afford a trade.

;B[nr];W[mq]C[Up to this point, I had formed two huge walls, but I didn't know how to put them to proper use.


At this point it is not so much how to put walls to proper use.  Black has already given you more from the walls than you should expect to get.  This is about defending your territory. :)
At this stage you will have to wait and see how black will try to reduce the moyo.  As white I would expect a move by black at tengen or around N10, but would not worry too much as the side is already big enough that I don't need much in the center.
-Erik];B[qi]C[This is clearly way too deep.  There is no chance of eyespace and black should not expect to be able to pull this stone out.
-Erik];W[pi]C[Maybe Q10 instead?

Yes, Q10 would have been far better.  Avoid weak stones that would give black the chance to do something.]
;B[pj];W[qk];B[oj];W[mj]C[Is this too close? Or am I attacking from the wrong side? Would Q12 have been better?

If you plan to respond with Q12 after O11 then this is to close, black can flow around you.  Q12 immidiately would be better.  Although it runs the risk of having black treat his two stones in a light manner and leaving you to worry about them.
However, because the capture of Q11 is at most one eye sacrificing it is better yet.  And then N10 is a good capping move.]

(;W[lk]C[I thught later that M8 probably was better, because it avoided the empty triangle.


There is no major difference.  This is OK becase the cut only comes into effect if black saves his stones.  If black elects to play P9(which he should not do) white needs to protect the cut.

This stone is dead, it might make moves around H16 more severe, but I can't see anythong.
