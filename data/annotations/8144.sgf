AB[pd][dp]C[h651: Hi!

Thank you very much for reviewing my game. i thought i played very well this game. better than usual. if you have any aditional comments outside of what i ask i would very much appreciate them!]
;W[dc];B[pp];W[nc]
(;B[pg]C[i usually prefer using this move when faced with that attack. i lose a lot in the corner, but i extended to the side twards my other corner.]
;W[ne];B[dm]C[i saw no vital threat in the previous move. is this correct?

Yup.  Better direction may have been F17 to minimize the O17 influence.]
;W[ce];B[ic]C[i normally play less agressively, but i felt that this potentially large teritory should be cut down before it becomes a problem. was it too soon?

Actually, a turn too late imo.  This play is too close to strength, which is why I preferred F17.]
;W[dj];B[fc]C[i thought it odd that he did not respond to my move, so i added a stone to strengthen my foothold.]
;W[qn];B[ql]C[this time i chose to counter attack because i felt the stones uptop would provide sufficient support.

Yup.];W[rp];B[qq];W[rq];B[mp]C[Good.];W[iq];B[gq];W[lq];B[mq]
;W[lp];B[pn]C[You play well in leaving battles early to take bigger points.  Hard point to learn.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[pm];B[qm];W[po];B[on]C[this was my first mistake i think. it cost me a lot of points.

I would have extended instead of cut.  You didn't have the strength to cut.]
;W[oo];B[rn]C[I like O5 better.];W[qo];B[om];W[mo];B[no];W[np]
;B[nq];W[nn];B[op];W[no];B[lr];W[kr];B[ls];W[or]C[i could have saved these stones, i think, but i didn't think my moves through proberly.

Were you worried about it dying yet?  That's usually my problem, is sometimes I see a group of stones alive when they really aren't.]
;B[pr];W[nr];B[mr];W[rr];B[ck]C[this was it. i thought i was secured but i was wrong.

A good rule of thumb is if a group has less than five liberties (like yours does right now) and isn't unconditionally alive yet, it is an urgent move (referring to the phrase "play urgent moves before big moves")]
;W[qr];B[os];W[ns];B[oq];W[ps];B[cj]C[i lost the corner, but tried to make up for it by exploiting  weakness.]
;W[di];B[dk]C[i saw potential to claim much of the center, which could seal the game. i started putting my stones into action and he never really challenged it.

Good.  A lot of DDKs don't use influence and the middle all that well.  I'd say a better move for that wouldn't been O13, or sealing the side with Q8 would be good too.]
;W[ci];B[ip];W[hq];B[hp];W[gr];B[fq];W[fr];B[er]C[Bigger moves elsewhere IMO.]
;W[nm];B[ol];W[pb];B[qc]C[Good response.];W[qb];B[fe]C[I like E15 better.]
;W[pi];B[oi];W[pk];B[ok];W[oj];B[nj];W[pj];B[oh];W[pl];B[nk]
;W[qk];B[rk];W[rj];B[rl];W[ri];B[rg];W[sk];B[sl];W[sj];B[qi]
;W[sm]C[You did everything right as far as I can see, I think the capture at Q8 would've prevented this all from happening instead of P8.]
;B[rm];W[ro];B[ph];W[sn];B[rh]C[i plaed this out just as badly as the corner, but it did create a wall to the center. which was my next target. i felt it wasn't a total loss.

No, you get a lot of influence to the center, and if you play carefully you can block most of white's approach.  Score est. puts W+2.5, so you more just lost a major lead than lost the game.]
;W[mi];B[ni];W[mg];B[fk]C[I like F10 better.];W[mj];B[ko]C[A little too close for my tastes. K6 is much more likely to contain.]
;W[lo];B[kn];W[mk]C[I don't really see what white is doing here.  A waste of a move in my eyes.]
;B[kk]C[Good moyo.];W[qe];B[pe];W[qd];B[rc];W[qf];B[pc];W[pf]
;B[of];W[oe];B[nf];W[mf];B[rb];W[nh];B[og];W[oc];B[lh]C[i liked this move.

Good peep.];W[ng];B[li];W[rf];B[sf];W[sg];B[sh];W[se];B[qg]
;W[sg];B[rd];W[nl]C[Silly moves.];B[re];W[jp];B[jo];W[kp];B[fi]
C[Good, but I think K14 is bigger.];W[io];B[ho];W[in];B[hn]
;W[im];B[km];W[ik];B[ii];W[jj];B[lj];W[ji];B[jh];W[ih];B[jg]
;W[hi];B[hh];W[ij];B[gh];W[ig];B[ke];W[jf];B[kf];W[kg]C[at this pint i was worried. i honestly hadn't thought of this encounter. i was worried i would lose the game.

This would be a game winner here, you should be worried.  He has a lot of space to run, but if you're careful you should be able to prevent any eyes.]
;B[kh];W[lg];B[mh]C[then i remebered the cut point he never reacted to.

lol nice.];W[me];B[ml];W[je];B[kd];W[lc];B[kc]C[I'll say at this point that middle group is dead.  It still has no eyes and any potential new eyes with the current shape (J14 and H10) can easily be prevented.]
;W[he];B[cg]C[This is a little deep with little support., D14 would be better.]
;W[dg];B[df];W[eg];B[cf];W[de]C[W should have cut E14 E15 D15.]
;B[ef];W[fg];B[gg];W[ff]
(;B[ee]C[I would take G14, you can connect F16 any time.  I believe that if you do you could have taken that group, but I'm not sure.  See variations.  The middle group would be dead too.]
;W[gf];B[ie];W[id];B[jd];W[if]C[Although actually you can still kill with D12 now.]
;B[hd];W[ie];B[hg]C[was this move required?

For what? If W makes an eye, G15 would make it false.  I don't see the purpose of this and it's bad shape.]
;W[ld]
(;B[gd]C[or this?];W[bc];B[fs]C[Also, B11 would work to kill the group too.]
;W[hr];B[eb];W[kb];B[jb];W[lb];B[db];W[cb];B[be];W[bd];B[bf]
;W[dd];B[cq]C[just for some extra comfort.

This is necessary if you want to keep the corner, 3-3 can work in this.  However, it would live small and ensure you your moyo so probably a bad idea by W.]

(;B[qa]
(;W[oa]
(;B[fh]C[Save this for if you need to or if you see a connect or die.  Neiter are there so take another move.  In fact, you could have lost because of this.  See var.]
