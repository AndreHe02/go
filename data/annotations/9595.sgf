C[Hi,
Thank you for reviewing my game.
This is a game I played at KGS against a 12k. Currently my rank at KGS is 13k, but I think my actual rank might be around 11k or 10k. Anyways, I played as B.

I used to play in a very conservative way, so now I'm trying to improve my attach.

I will comment the game with questions.
Sadly, by the end, my internet connection lagged and I run out of time, but I was ahead probably by 50 points (correct me if I'm wrong).
I hope you find the game interesting.

Hello,

I'm Julien, 1k on KGS. I will provide variations and comments of your game.

But if you lost the game while you was ahead by 50 points, you have to learn to play a bit faster ;-).]
;B[qd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[fc];W[oc];B[mc];W[kc];B[me]C[Bad move because it lets white connects its stones. 

White overplayed here because it is difficult to counter-pincer when you are not strong in this area. So just split its stones is enough and the ongoing fight will be good for black.]

(;W[hc];B[cc];W[dc]
(;B[db]C[Later in the game, I didn't do much more about the upper left group and I more or less let it die, but what would have been a good move here to secure the corner. And more important, is it worthy?

See the variation which is joseki.];W[bd];B[gq]C[This aproach looks bad. Maybe g4 was better? Or something in the k line?

Tenuki at top left is bad because you are not alive there. The most important principle of the fuseki is the following:

1. First, settle your group in order to be both (almost) alive and not fully surrounded

2. Then play in the widest area

3. Finally choose between the 3d line (territory) and the 4th line (influence)

For G3, the very usual move is F3. F4 is possible if you like moyos. G3, G4 or other moves are only in special circumstances.]
;W[qf];B[oe];W[nd];B[md];W[ne];B[nf];W[pe]
(;B[od]C[Bad move: what is important here is not (only) the 2 white stones but the corner.]
;W[pd]
(;B[of];W[qc];B[rd]C[You are already dead here. Keep the remaining aji for latter use.]
;W[rc];B[nc]TR[of]C[I didn't know what to do at this point.
Should I try to find a way to save the two isolated stones? (they look doomed anyways). Should I tenuki? Maybe enclose the lower right? Or attach the lower left?
In the end I choose this move as it leaves a strong shape.

Now, you understand why P14 was a bad move ;-). But here I think you could safely tenuki. There is huge move in other places of the board (e.g. R5 or C6). Also if white plays O17, you can then add a move around the cut at N14 to secure your stones. So there is nothing urgent to play O17.]
;W[ob];B[cn]C[But ok, white was nice and you get sente anyway :-).

C6 is a good move.];W[qo]C[That is also a good move (I think C6 and R5 were miai in this position).]

(;B[qm]TR[mc][nc][md][od][me][oe][nf][of]C[I'm not sure that the pincer is good here because the right side does not look very important : the marked stones are now strong and limit what white can do in the right side (and in the top too).

So I would have play O4.];W[qk]
(;B[om]C[Once again, I would prefer to separate the white stones here by playing Q6. Or (maybe better), make a wall facing the bottom by playing Q5.]
;W[oo];B[np];W[pn];B[pm];W[qq]
(;B[rm]TR[pm][pn]C[This move doesn't look good now.
As alternatives I can think of:

c3. A san san in the lower left might have been interesting, as it has the aid of two stones. But it gives a lot of influence for w thowards the center.

q2. Helps building a moyo on the lower side.

l4. Maybe, but leaves an opening at r2.

r11. Also looks a bit strange.

Suggestions?


This move is not good because the primary purpose of such a 2d-line move is to prevent white from connecting. But, since white (badly) exchanges Q6 for Q7, white cannot connect anymore. So your move is useless.

The standard move here is R2 in order to prevent white to live in the corner.]
;W[lq];B[lp];W[oq]C[I was about to abandom the stone at q3, but I wanted to see what happen]
;B[pp]C[I think it is good. And as you said, you can still abandon these stones.]
;W[op];B[or];W[nr];B[pr];W[nq];B[qp];W[iq];B[kq];W[kp];B[kr]
;W[mp];B[lo]C[In this way, I managed to steal the corner, but the price was a piece of the lower side.]
;W[mo]
(;B[mn]C[Ok, you saved the corner, but you have to let something to white. You cannot expect to save all your stones here.]
;W[ko];B[ln];W[lr];B[nn];W[no];B[ro]C[As a side effect of this fight, I built a big moyo towards the center. In the end, this was decisive.

I think this sequence is playable for both side. You don't get a moyo at all: white has sente and would have to play around R12.]

(;W[fq];B[go];W[hp];B[gp];W[gr];B[hr];W[ir];B[fr]C[I managed to steal some points here and reduce the corner, but I feel that mainly because my oponent didn't respond optimally.]
;W[er];B[gs];W[bp]
(;B[eq]C[Bad move : you only get the F3 stones while white becomes strong.]
;W[dq];B[ep];W[eo];B[fp];W[dm];B[do]C[This cut felt as risky at the moment of playing it, but again, I wanted to explore its posibilities.

Yes it is bad (see variation).]
(;W[co];B[dn];W[bn];B[cm];W[dg];B[dr];W[cr];B[es];W[cq]
(;B[qi]C[Too close of your wall.];W[mk]C[It took me some time to decide how to respond to this move.
Options were:

To cut at p9.

l8

p11.

In the end, I tenuki.

Your decision was good. The white move is bad because it has no clear meaning. If white adds a move in this area, he will only create a weak group itself. So tenuki and either white will create a weak group latter here, or this white stone will be captured quietly ;-).]

(;B[dk]C[What is the purpose of this move ?];W[ck];B[cl];W[cj]
;B[dj];W[ci];B[ge];W[il]C[Now it was time to do something about these w stones in the center]

(;B[kl];W[in]

[rs][ss]C[As I see it now, I have two nice moyos.
One on the right towards the center.
Other smaller on the lower left.

The w group at h7 looks problematic and I think I should try to contain it.

What is your general opinion of the board at this point?

White has 50 points (no komi I guess ?). Black has 63 points. So you're ahead. You have potential in the O12 area, but there is no moyo at all on the lower left.

But what the status of the top? The player who plays first there will win the corner and a large amount of points.]
;W[di];B[is]C[At this point of the game, it came to my mind the general principle of keeping sente.]
;W[js]
(;B[hs];W[jr]
(;B[gj]C[What is the meaning of this move? this move is not sente and is small.]

(;W[pi]C[I could see this w move coming...];B[ph];W[qh];B[rh]

(;W[oh]C[If w would have responded at r13 instead, the result would have been much worst for me.]
;B[qg];W[mh]
(;B[oi]C[Bad move. You only help white to settle its group.]
;W[ni];B[oj]
(;W[kk]C[Now it starts an interesting attempt of w to form a living group. My goal was to contain it with the minimum amount of moves to try to profit also in the rest of the board.]
;B[jk];W[lj];B[ki];W[lh];B[kg]C[Good move. White will die.]
;W[kh];B[jh];W[lg];B[kf];W[ok]C[I realized that I could manage to kill the w group and at the same time build moyo to the center/left.

There is no moyo in the center-left and there was never a moyo there. So just kill this white group and you win.]
;B[pj];W[ll];B[jl];W[nl]
(;B[ei]
(;W[eh];B[fh]C[This was risky, as it leaves a cut, but I estimated I could handle it as I had the supporting stone at g10.]

;W[li]
(;B[ji];W[nj];B[ol]
(;W[nm];B[mm];W[on]C[I didn't get this move of w. Maybe was aiming at killing my r7 group. So, I tenuki.

That's just a bad white move ;-).];B[bl]C[I played here as is sente, and leave a nice monkey jump is not responded.]
;W[ij];B[ik];W[hk];B[hj];W[gk];B[gi]C[Maybe there were more optimal answers, but this looked safe.
At this point of the game I could see that my internet was lagging... and I was running out of time.

That's a very-safe very-good move :-). When you are winning, just play easy move. White should have already resigned.]
;W[gm];B[fm];W[fd];B[gd];W[ec];B[ee]C[What is this move?];W[gc]
;B[fe];W[fb];B[de];W[ce];B[jd];W[jc];B[ai]C[And here comes the monkey jump (I love this move =) )]
;W[bi];B[ak];W[ah];B[aj];W[bh]C[Out of time...

As a general comment after reviewing the game, I feel that I didn't start well as I miss 3 of the corners. This is specially bad being b. But I managed to compensate by means of influence to the center and building moyos. This is something I usually don't do.

I'm looking forward to hear your comments.
Thanks again.
Eysenck

I already put a lot of comments/variations in this game. You played better than your opponent in this game. But I think you could improve your global view of the board: what is strong/weak, what is potential, what is territory, where aji remains...

Also do not forget the more important principle of Fuseki: first settle your group and do not tenuki while your groups are not settle. When done, play in the widest area.

Hope you enjoy the review,
Julien
