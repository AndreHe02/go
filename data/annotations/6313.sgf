C[My main point of concern in this game is my expansion is the middle . Playing go for a while , i often lost "the flow of the game" after the beginning (i.e i dont know how to expand to the middle..) . I think i did good and was leading in the beginning (not really sure about that ).I played black .  I'm about 12k on KGS . Thank in advance

>Overall, it's an interesting game, and I can definitely see why you wanted it reviewed. It was a close game with a lot of complications. A lot was going on here.

> You seem to have a decent understanding of opening theory and a very good grasp of the other basics, so my reccomendations are:

 1) Study some 3-4 joseki. Here's a good place for that: http://eidogo.com/#kjd
> When you study, though, don't just memorize. Look for places where your opponent may deviate and figure out ways to answer them. Chances are, if a move isn't joseki, it's bad somehow. That said, as far as I know, no place has actually set out a complete list of joseki mistakes and how to punish them, so it's up to you to figure it out on your own. Then, when you come up on a position, think, "What do I want out of this? What joseki will give me that?" And if there are no joseki that you know will give you that, try deviating. The worst that will happen is that you'll make a mistake. And if you do, you can go back and study what happened there later. 
2) Study some middle-game theory. 
3) When you play your games, consiouly think up a strategy and follow it. Change your strategy as the game changes, but the proverb goes "it is better to have a bad plan than no plan at all". To choose your strategy, count the score to see how agressive you need to be. Are you behind? If the answer is "yes", then you need to be more aggressive. If not, you can be a bit more relaxed. Then identifiy if there are any thin areas or weak groups. If there are, let the score decide if you need to make an invasion or a reduction, launch an all-or-nothing attack or maybe attack a bit more flexibly. You're at a point where having a strategy will help your game significantly. Counting, and letting the score dictate how agressive my play is made the difference between 8k KGS and 4k KGS for me.  I strongly suspect that you'll see a similar improvement.

> As well, I have two books to recommend, if you don't already have them:
1) Lessons in the Fundamentals of Go by Kageyama Toshiro (Western booksellers will probably list his name as "Toshiro Kageyama", though). You're about at the perfect level for this one.
2) Attack and Defense, by Ishida Akira and James Davies.

;W[bh];B[bg];W[ci]C[> b needs to come ahead in the endgame by pushing down on w's groups. This has become a centre-oriented game. A rough estimate shows the following:

W, top left: ~10 points
     Top right: ~20 points
     Left side: 8 points
     Bottom left: ~10 points
     Bottom right: ~ 5 points
W, total: roughly 60 points, including captured stones and komi

B, top left: 5 points
     Top: ~ 10 points
      Right side: ~25 points
      Bottom:  ~15 points.
B, total: Roughly 50 points, including captures. 

Note this does not include aji or influence.

So, the way things currently stand, b needs to eke out ten more points in the centre than w. How can this be done? look around: Where is there aji, and how can b use it? Two places pop out to me: Bottom left and top left. The bottom right has some aji, too, but it's not immediate. See the variation:]

> This situation actually began to be troubled at move 129, so see the variation there for details.

The thing here is that this is a center oriented game. Whoever ekes out more in the centre will probably win. 

B has more influence, but w is ahead in territory. In addition, w has three easy launching areas (the marked stones) to enter Black's area of influence and make very damaging reductions from. This is not an easy situation for black. In this situation, I would probably play n9 or something of the sort to try and get enough out of the side to have a shot at winning, but I think that, barring some great mistake, w has a won game at this point.]
