AB[pd][dp]C[Hi!

I am Tero, EGF 4kyu. 
Hope my comments help.


Dear reviewer,

I am currently 9k on KGS and this is a game I played against a 7k.

Mostly, I am interested in improving my strategy during the opening and middle game and my fighting skills.

And of course, I am looking forward to your ideas on how I could improve the most.

Thank you in advance.

(;B[fq];W[dj]C[Tero: Yes, this is nice for white, but black has some nice options here too. I would like to protect a corner and harash the white, see variations.


This was a nice opening for him, giving him a very efficient position on the left, I think. It is the first time, that I am confronted with this. If I had seen this coming, I should probably have played a pincer.

But I tend to be unsure which pincer to choose. Could you show me an alternative, possibly including a pincer, if appropriate?]

(;B[qn];W[hc];B[mc]C[Tero: Maybe it would be better to defend the corner with B16.]
;W[kc]C[Tero: You have to give something, if N17 is at L17 it forces white to run, but also weakens the upper left corner.

I guess my move should have been one step further to the left to prevent him from making the 2-space extension so comfortably?]
;B[le]C[Tero: This is too agressive. Your upper left corner is not strong enough for you to attack now. Better moves would be C15, B16 or C16. If you feel that you must attack the two white stones in the upper side, then maybe F15 gives them some pressure, while it helps the corner and sets up some attacking possibilites for the left side.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be];W[bc];B[ce];W[eb];B[dc]C[Tero: Maybe E17 or G17 instead.]
;W[db];B[df];W[ec];B[ed];W[fd];B[fe];W[gd];B[cg];W[hq];B[cp]
;W[en];B[pj]C[Tero: Yes, a move somewhere around here is nice, but it is hard to find a good place, because the M15 stone does not protect the upper right corner. 

This was about time, I think.];W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc];W[ob]
;B[nb]C[Tero: Usually it is better to take O17 here.];W[od]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[qe];W[pb];B[sd]C[I saw a chance of killing his corner group.]
;W[sc];B[oa];W[pa];B[rb]C[A position like this came up, while i was practising tsumego...]
;W[ra];B[sb];W[se]C[Tero: Also O19 gives white extra liberty. Well, you made white small...

... but I didn't consider this possibility for him to gain an extra liberty just in time.]
;B[sf];W[qb];B[nq]C[Tero: Yes, a double kakari is looks ok.

I think this move is good, because it threatens the corner and contains the possibility of making a 2-space extension to the left to attack his stone h3.]
;W[pn];B[pm];W[on]C[Tero: Here maybe going for the corner would work. See variation.]

(;B[om];W[nn];B[kq]C[Tero: The black stones on the lower side look rathe heavy now. Maybe you should have gone for the corner instead.

I was considering to continue building a wall on line 7, but feared he could attack my stone o3.]
;W[qo];B[rn];W[oq];B[np]C[Tero: L5 seems even better, as it is reaching towards the center. Now you end up quite heavy and rather easily closed in with only a few points, while white gets nice influence for the center.

I am not sure about this defense. It should probably have been on m5 or thereabaout?]
;W[ko];B[jp];W[lr]C[Tero: This is a common move to take away the base from your group. Now white H3 seems too far for this to kill you, but you have to use several moves to live, while white gets some profit.

Huh! These are moves that impress me and which I never play, because they simply don't come to my mind. I tried to give him a hard time, though.]
;B[mr];W[lq];B[lp];W[kp];B[mq];W[lo];B[mp];W[jq];B[kr];W[jr]
;B[ls];W[ip]C[Tero: Seems to me that white wanted to make his K3 stones stronger, since you have a lot of liberties on your N3 stones. You can't get many points with N3 group anyway. This way white also gains some influence towards the center.

Should he have played at p2 to prevent me from gaining 2 eyes?]
;B[or];W[pr];B[os]C[At this point I felt, that he allowed me to have 2 eyes, by not playing at p2 earlier. But maybe it was necessary to play j4 instead.]
;W[oi]TR[le][mh][nj][om]C[Tero: This seems a bit deep as a reduction. Normally one looks at the line between the outer edges of a moyo (marked with triangles) to find a reduction point. Maybe white thinks that the P16 stone has some aiji... 

Another one of those moves, that wouldn't occur to me.];B[nk]
C[Tero: You still need at least one more move to seal white in.  White has a clear way out by jumping ar N11 or similar. How about playing Q12 or Q11 to protect the side and force white out of your moyo.]
;W[of];B[oe];W[pi]C[Tero: White has a lot of selfconfidence here. Maybe white should just step towards the center to avoid trouble.]
;B[mi]C[Tero: This seems natural, if you are going to keep white inside.

I planned to keep him from running into the center. Is there a better approach that I missed?]
;W[rl];B[qk]C[Tero: And I guess that white was not happy, as he ended up only making you stronger.

This is a move that makes me happy, since I read through the complete following sequence.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[ql];B[pl];W[rj];B[rk];W[mh];B[ni];W[mg];B[nh]
;W[ng];B[og];W[pg];B[oh];W[ne];B[nd];W[pf];B[je]C[Tero: N15 would be sente, and it would give you a much stronger position.

I am trying to threaten an attack on the upper side to gain the opportunity to block his flight into the center.]
;W[me];B[ld];W[pe];B[od];W[lc];B[md];W[ph];B[kh];W[kg]LB[ig:A]
[lh:B]
(;B[ig]C[Tero: This move is vague and it is not clear to me what you try to accomplish here. The variation you gave contained a few mistakes, as far as I see, the correct move is K12.

I am not sure about this move. Maybe the variation I added?]
;W[lh];B[ki];W[li];B[lj];W[mj];B[nj];W[kj];B[lk];W[jh];B[ji]
;W[ii];B[jj];W[ij];B[jk];W[jg];B[ih];W[if]C[I think here it becomes clear that I failed. He either connects to the upper side, which I try to prevent with my following move...]
;B[jf];W[hg]C[Tero: And what would F11 accomplish? You do well in the actual game, to take sente and force your opponent to take your stones right away. At the same time you secure the O17 stones and score some points on the upper side.


... or he has me in this ladder, which I only recognised after my next move. What would have been a better continuation - maybe f11 as a potential ladder-blocker?]
;B[hh];W[gh];B[hf];W[hi];B[he];W[ie];B[id];W[ig]C[Tero: This white move is really small at this point.]
;B[ic];W[hd];B[hb];W[gb];B[jb];W[ha];B[jc];W[ib];B[kb]C[Tero: This move is not needed. You waste sente. Maybe B10 now.]
;W[bh];B[bg];W[ee]C[Tero: Yes, I can't se any reason to play this. Now your D16 group has solid eyes, and you can even pick up H15 and H14 at the same time.

Strange move - "thank you", I thought.];B[ff];W[gr];B[fr];W[bo]
;B[bp];W[fs];B[es];W[gs]
(;B[dr]C[Tero: Yes, this has to be here. At first I thought, that you can protect at B2, making A4 gote for white, but seems that F3 is too weak, with E6 in place. Well played.]
;W[ap];B[aq];W[ao];B[bq];W[ml];B[mm]C[Tero: Why here? Since white can get out with N8 stone, and even ends up capturing N7, this is clearly an overplay.]
;W[ll];B[mk];W[kl];B[kk];W[nm];B[gn]C[A ladder-block for k4.]

;W[ik];B[hn];W[fp];B[gp];W[gq];B[fo];W[hp];B[ep];W[ir]C[Tero: Well, he has only 3 or 4 point, so it is not a good result for white, especially since you get sente.

Too bad he lives, but I couldn't have prevented it, I think.]
;B[ci];W[cj];B[bi];W[bj];B[aj];W[ak];B[ai];W[bm]C[Good, dual-purpose defense. Something I want to remember.]
;B[mf];W[nf];B[lf];W[lg];B[sq]C[Tero: Nothing wrong with this monky-jump. I would say this is rather well timed.

I like monkey-jumps and couldn't resist the opportunity. But this was premature, as I soon found out.]
;W[rq]
(;B[ro]C[Tero: I do not see how... See variations.

Without this move, I would have ended up short of liberties.]
;W[rp];B[sl]C[Tero: Only because of S5.

I had to abandon t3.];W[sp];B[ps]C[Tero: This was very big earlier, but S3 helps white now.]
;W[qr];B[oo]
(;W[po]C[Tero: This is a mistake from white. P4 protects Q3 point also.]
;B[fh];W[fi];B[eh];W[di];B[dh];W[gk];B[fm];W[em];B[gl];W[hk]
;B[dn]C[Tero: this is clearly a gote move, with only small value. Better moves for example are E11 and S11.]

[ds][ms][ns]C[Tero: The endgame is maybe the easiest way to get better. In the endgame there are only few sequences left, and the sequences are rather short, so even kyu-level players can understand something of them. 

In the opening it is good to know some principles, but even amateur-dan-players do not really understand the opening. Some professionals claim that they don't either. 

For the middle game I recommend www.goproblems.com. There you can easily improve your skills in life and death as well as learn some pretty funky tesuji. 

Also I noticed that your shapes were often inefficient, maybe you would benefit from reading Shape Up, by Charles Matthews at  http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/shape_up/

Good luck for your future games, 
and may your stones always find two eyes,

Tero


I recognise, that my endgame is not as strong as it could be, if I would think more about the proper order of my moves, maintaining sente.

Apart from that I am very interested in getting stronger in the opening and middle game. I often had the feeling, that I was following white around quite a bit in this game.

What is your advice for my improvement? What should I concentrate on?

Thank you in advance!])

There is a lot of fighting starting from white pushing at P10. White can try to cut the O11 stones either at O10 or at O7 or O8 later on. Then black will have trouble with M11 and K12 cuts. If black can keep white inside, white dies. White does have a chance for a ko at S14, but it seems very risky and white needs to get O19 or T19 first.]
