C[I am "Kin" (black) in this game, and I would like to request a stronger player to analyze this game.  I also left a few comments/questions over specific moves that hopefully you may be able to answer [ but of course, feel free to review over more than just the moves I commented on :) \].

!! And of course, a big thank-you to the reviewer :). !!];B[pd]

;W[ro];B[rq];W[rn];B[or];W[oq];B[nr];W[nq]C[Here I think black should prevent white from making a strong group at Q8.]

(;B[ep]C[I think this move is not appropriate considering white has a group at N3. He used your move at E4 to build up his group at N3.]
;W[gq];B[fo];W[mr];B[pr];W[go];B[gn]C[If white played like the sequence below, it would have been troublesome for black]

(;W[gp];B[hn];W[eq]
(;B[dp]C[Is this the wrong move since D4 "bumps" into the hane? Maybe C5?

I think D4 is okay here, it forces white to answer. C5 doesn't change the result too much, you gain a big influence over the left part of the board.]

(;B[dg]C[Good move here, you push white towards your wall and he lives painfully while you make territory.]
;W[cg];B[cf];W[ch];B[bf];W[ck]C[Here you can continue to push white, you are not the one who should defend, white has a weak group between two strong group.

Many ways to attack.]
(;B[fc];W[el]C[This move is not threatening your group, you should prevent white from escaping.]

(;B[jg]C[Too loose possibly?

No I like this move, if it weren't for the opening at F13, it would be perfect. Maybe playing closer to your group on the left side and using the influence of your wall to push white would be a good idea.]
;W[he]C[Here I think white did not play too well, he tried to live from the inside, he should have use his move in another way.]

There is a way to reduce the damage, see the sequence at move 110]
