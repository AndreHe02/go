AB[dd][pd][dp][pp]C[bucky: hello reviewer, thank you for looking over my game.  I play a lot of handicap games as white, and usually destroy my opponent, but lately I have been getting some really good games.  In fact, this is probably the most interesting game I've played lately handicap or no.  I am mostly curious about how to open stronger, to get a bigger early lead without leaving holes that a weaker player can exploit ;-)

reviewer: usually it's best to have games reviewed where you're playing black against a stronger player. that way, the reviewer can focus on your mistakes instead of your opponents. in any handicap game, black will typically make more serious mistakes than white. additionally, white often plays marginally dishonest moves in a handicap game, so you don't want to criticize unnecessarily. however, i realize that you can also learn from a handicap game, so it's all good.

reviewed by adum 3D];W[nc];B[pj];W[gd];B[dj];W[qf];B[jp]C[bucky: I always get in trouble when black plays like this:  without a direct response to my first 4 or 5 moves.  How is it best to play when black is being conservative?

reviewer: don't worry about it too much. you can always steal that territory from black later. don't expect to make up the 4 stones too quickly.]

(;B[qm];W[pr];B[qq];W[no]C[bucky: I have to hope that black will not exploit any of my early tenuki, but that is often the case giving a handicap.  Any thoughts on how to give c6, o3, and r14 better shape without losing sente or center influence?

reviewer: often a good strategy is to not worry about your lone stones like C6. assume that because you are stronger, it's not necessary to help them now.

this move here is good to keep you moving out into the center, an important thing to remember in handicap games (as well as even!)]

(;W[bm];B[em];W[il]C[bucky: i have erased most of the side areas, but lost a lot of thickness.  the way black responds now, I think I am not giving him enough credit ;-)  how should I play here?

reviewer: the left side is bad for white. black came out on top by closing you off and getting a huge impenetrable wall. it's still a three-stone handicap game, i would say, which is bad news 67 moves in.

you're going to have to play some patient moves to win now, since you've let black become thick all over.]

(;W[hc]C[bucky: this seems a misread to me.  should this be k16, or somewhere else?
