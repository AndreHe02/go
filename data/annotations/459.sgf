C[NM: I am submitting this game for review:

1) because I turned out not to be as
    far ahead as I had thought, and I
    would like to know where my errors
    were;

2) because I would be interested to know
    where my opponent went wrong;

3) and because of certain specific moves
    on which I would like comments.]PL[B];B[pd]BL[896];W[dp]
WL[897];B[pp]C[NM: I have found in the past with this
        opponent that I seem to do best
        taking san-ren-sei  - it's
        not an opening I use much
        otherwise.]BL[895];W[dc]WL[893];B[pj]BL[891];W[ci]WL[889]
;B[de]C[ NM: Was this too early?  I didn't like
         to approach round F17, but
         maybe something like K16
         would have been better.

I think this is just a matter of taste. F3 or G16 are also
often seen.]BL[879];W[ce]C[More usuall is F16. The purpose of the chinese fuseki is to
drive the invading stone against C11.]WL[881];B[cf]C[This is natural if there is no stone at C11. I would prefer D16.]
BL[876];W[cd]WL[879];B[eh]C[NM: My favourite way to get sabaki
        here, but ...]BL[873];W[cg]C[NM: ... I didn't expect this.]
WL[868];B[bf]C[NM: I couldn't see any better move.
        Is there one?

No, this is a must. I don't see a problem.]BL[823];W[dg]WL[863]
;B[df]BL[797];W[eg]WL[859];B[ec]BL[794];W[eb]WL[856];B[dd]C[Better at F17.]
BL[766];W[cb]C[White should play F17. The ponnuki would be nice for white IMHO.]
WL[846];B[fc]BL[761];W[fb]C[NM: Should W have          played F15 at this point?

No. :-) Sealing in white with F18 after F15 feels good for black.]
WL[843];B[gc]BL[736];W[gb]WL[840];B[hc]C[NM: I thought it couldn't be bad to go
        on pushing W down to the 2nd
        line... or should I play tenuki?

NO, never play tenuki in a situation like this. Always
extend three stones once more. After a white hane at H17
the game is over for black. ;-)]BL[713];W[dl]WL[829];B[fq]BL[711]
;W[hq]WL[825];B[cq]C[NM: I was hoping to leave W over-
        concentrated if he played C4.

I think C4 is better for white than D3. In the game the stones
around C11 are loosing some of their value.]BL[705];W[dq]WL[823]
;B[cp]BL[679];W[do]WL[820];B[dr]BL[676];W[er]WL[818];B[cr]BL[675]
;W[eq]WL[817];B[cn]C[NM: Should this have been B6? It
        would have been lovely to come
        out with sente and play K3...

In this variation black has no right to get sente. C6 is ok.
I do not see why B6 should be sente for black.]BL[642];W[dn]
C[This is aji keshi. White should switch to O3.
There is no meaning in a black move at D6 since there are the
white stones above.]WL[812];B[bm]BL[628];W[nq]WL[807];B[kp]
C[NM: Would another pincer, say
        K3 or M4, or tsuke-osae (O4, P3)
        have been  better?

Difficult decision. I think Q6 is also playable. After a normal
continuation (like Q2, R3, M4) one can still press i.e. at H5.
There is the aji of the stone at F3.]BL[579];W[io]C[Totaly wong strategy. White is trying to secure territory
with his wall. This is nearly always bad. Better something like
O5, Q6, Q2, R3, L2.]WL[801];B[oq]C[NM: Would O4 have been better here?

Yes]BL[546];W[np]WL[798];B[pn]BL[546];W[im]C[O6 is better]WL[791]
;B[nn]C[NM: I decided to sacrifice L4 in order
        to build up my moyo. Was that
        good? I didn't fancy playing say
        M6 and pushing W into my
        moyo.

O6 is correct. I feel this is rather an attack at O3 and O4
as a sacrifice.]BL[541];W[lo]WL[786];B[lm]BL[445];W[ko]WL[781]
;B[nr]BL[419];W[mr]WL[778];B[or]BL[418];W[lq]WL[771];B[oc]C[NM: Lots of questions here: What
        would have been better? H18?
       O16? K10? G14?

Maybe Q14 or R16? The upper side is not so interesting as it is
open at H18. H18 instead of P17 is greedy. There would be
enough room for white to play like O17. After that H18 looks
like a wasted move.]BL[394];W[qf]WL[756];B[qe]C[NM: Or should I have played R12?

This is ok. You get to play at R12 anyway squeezing white
in the middle and strengthening your framework.]BL[371];W[pf]
WL[750];B[qh]C[NM: Was this good, or would I have
         been better to try and confine W
         with something like O14?

Yes good. A move like O14 would be wrong since you are open
at E13.]BL[367];W[ph]WL[728];B[qi]BL[349];W[mg]WL[725];B[ne]
BL[347];W[nf]WL[712];B[mj]C[NM: Tertitorially, I wanted to play
        N15, but I felt I would lose any
        chance of attacking if I did that.

N15 looks much stronger. I don't see a good attack if white
plays N15 now.]BL[331];W[ni]WL[701];B[nj]BL[320];W[me]WL[693]

;W[jd]C[Now your stones around F17 are weak. N15 would have been much
better.]WL[668];B[lf]C[NM: Perhaps these moves were a bit
        too soon....

Unreasonable. You are hurting your upper left group.]BL[279]
;W[mf]WL[664];B[ke]BL[275];W[je]WL[652];B[jf]BL[269];W[kd]WL[649]
;B[hf]C[NM: Some reinforcement of the D15
        group seemed necessary, even if
        W could take the K14 stones.]BL[240];W[ik]WL[637];B[jl]

;W[fk]WL[612];B[dj]BL[164];W[cj]WL[609];B[ck]C[NM: This attack failed, so I suppose it
        would have been better not to
        make it.  Should I just play B9?
        Or indeed H18? Or F14?

How about D9 instead? Maybe this works.]BL[126];W[co]WL[598]

Yes.
