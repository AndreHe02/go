C[Hi reviewer,

I played Black on this game. I wrote some questions along this game. Don't 
hesitate to add other comments, particularly on the global vision of the 
game, I have difficulties to evaluate influence power and any help on this 
would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Zakalwe

Jay: Happy to help.  My comments included.];B[pd];W[cp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[ep];W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp];W[cn];B[jp]C[Jay: Standard opening.]
;W[po]
(;B[np]C[Jay:  I would prefer to play pincer around Q7 or Q8. This would 
force W jumping from O5, and B would follow by either attaching at O4, or a 
simple jump at O3 would be sufficient to set up an attack, and at the same 
time B would develop along the right side.   (See variation)]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or]C[I thought of S2, but here i prefered a solid move. Is it right ?

Jay: This is good given the circumstance.  But, W settles too easy next.]
;W[ql]C[Jay: W could have one more space in this extension.]
;B[qj]C[Jay: Too close.  Because W is solid here.];W[qh]C[Jay: W did not hesitate.]
;B[qf]C[I played this move to keep possibilities in the corner.  would P10 
be better first ?

Jay: This is ok.  Imagine that instead of play R10, B could'v played R14.  
Then, W over played R12, B's R10 becomes a good move.];W[oh]
;B[oj];W[ol]C[Jay: B is in slight trouble.];B[rh]C[maybe N10 is better, before connecting

Jay: N10 is better.  You want to keep ahead of W in the race toward the 
center.]
(;W[ri]C[Jay: This W's move is wrong.  See variation.];B[qi]
;W[rg];B[ph];W[qg];B[pg];W[rf];B[qe];W[jc]C[I felt bad here, because influence i built is greatly reduced by W 
K17 ...];B[rj];W[sh];B[cf]C[Is it the right approach ?

Jay: This is a timely play.];W[fd];B[bd];W[ce];B[be];W[df]
(;B[cc]C[Jay: I would move toward the center instead getting enclosed in the 
corner.   Also, W's K17 is a weak extension.  Exchanging C17 with W's D17 
makes K17 a good extension, helping W.];W[cg];B[eb]C[I think this move is big but i regretted leaving W makes a 
ponnuki...

Jay: This is the price of C17.];W[dc];B[db];W[bf]C[Jay: This is terrible for B, because W has a strong side on the 
left, combined with influence on the top left.];B[je]C[W has a great influence on the right side and the center, so i 
played K15 to reduce it.];W[mc]
(;B[oc]C[Jay: Too heavy here for B by playing this move.  See the 
variations.];W[me]C[here my troubles started. I didn't know how to play here ...

Jay: It started one move earlier.];B[ld];W[md]
(;B[lc]C[Jay: You should jump out at K13 or K12 now.  See variations.]
;W[kd];B[le];W[ke];B[lf];W[kf];B[hd]C[I'm not proud of this move.]
;W[gc];B[hc];W[hf]
(;B[kb]C[Now i think that H18 allow B to connect left or right. do you agree 
? If so, H18 is much better than L18 i think.

Jay: Agree.];W[jb];B[dj]C[I leaved my 3 stones, and see what i can do on this side.]
;W[fj]C[Boshi seems natural.];B[em]C[Jay: Too large a jump.]
;W[dk];B[dl];W[ck]
(;B[cl]C[E9 before ?

Jay: The same.];W[bm]C[Jay: W's mistake.];B[bl];W[ek];B[bj]
;W[ip]C[I never knows how to answer to these kind of move. Is there a way to 
deal with ?

Jay: It all depends on the surrounding situation.  Here, you have a weak 
group on the left.  Thus, you should play with this on mind.  What you 
played is ok.  It basically protected this weakness.  But, it still left 
some weakness.  A better way could be (see variations). ...]

;B[en];W[fl];B[nn]C[I thought this was sente because of B Q7, but white tenuki

Jay: Q7 is not life threatening, if W responds with R7.];W[jn]
C[Should I add a move to ensure connection between F3 and J3 ? Later i 
suffered from not have played it...

Jay: B can make some kind of living here, but with some losses, in 
particular, in the center where it is more urgent now.]
(;B[lh]C[Jay: Good to come out here and trap W's N16 group.]
;W[kn];B[lo]C[maybe a move in the center is better ?

Jay: This is solid, since you already gained some on the upper right.]
;W[kg];B[kh]C[Jay: Wrong move!.  It gave W some chance to profit in the center.]
;W[lg];B[mf];W[mg];B[nf];W[mh];B[lk];W[jh];B[kj];W[hq]C[I feel bad for my F3 group ;-)

Jay: Now, the mistake in the center is costly.  Compare the variation with 
the earlier ones without those center stones.]
(;B[ir];W[hr];B[hp]
(;W[ho]C[Jay: W's mistake.]
(;B[fm]C[I didn't see that  B can connect with G4.  It would have been much 
easier for me...];W[gp];B[gn];W[go]C[Jay: A waste of move here for W.]
;B[gl];W[hm];B[gm];W[ik];B[cm];W[bn];B[gk]C[Can W play E8 to prevent B from making 2 eyes ?

Jay: Sure.]
(;W[cj]C[From now B can live with E8, but i saw it only few move later.]

;B[fi];W[ci];B[el];W[al];B[fk];W[jq]C[W is gote here, is it the right time to play this ? is W looking for 
eyes ?

Jay: W didn't play well earlier, allowing B to get into W's thick area on 
the left-top.  W can get out from the top or from lower left for connection 
if under attack.  So, W is mearly gaining some small profits here.]
