It seems the normal handicap would be 4 stones, this game was played with 2 stones, that's why we both decided I can review it.

I would recommend pincering at a or b (C10, D10), W makes a double kakari at c or d (F3, F4), then you attach this stone and makes a moyo. The joseki are not complicated.

If you have a real plan, that could be OK, but it seems better to follow the joseki and play c (see var).

You made this move for having territory, don't you ? This is not consistent with the pincer you played.

So, try the pincer at a or b (D9, D10). These pincers are not very severe, but are very good for handicap games (perfect for 4 stones). But as I think your style is not to be an all-out fighter, maybe they will fit you. You can find an extensive study of these joseki in a book I recommend : "Basic technics of Go". Well, some persons dislike this book, others like it very much...]

By the way, playing at a (M17) and invading is thoroughly studied in "Get strong at invading" :-))

For B : 15 (left side) +   20 (NE) + 25 (SE) and very little prospects.   So things are difficult for B now...]
