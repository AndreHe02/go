AB[pd][dp]C[Meekohi: Hello :)
poka3: Hi!];W[dd]C[Hi reviewer and thanks for your help!

I'm Meekohi playing black this game and am hoping you can help point out some mistakes I missed here.

------------------

Hi Meekohi. 

I must say that for a 13k you played quite well. You'll improve fast.
Overall you didn't make many outrageous mistakes, so I'll try my best to point out certain issues and give you some tips.

(;B[re]C[This move can be used sometimes in other situations. Here there are better moves so you don't need to decide about sacrificing the S15 stone or not. 

Anyways, the answer to your question is YES, you can and you usually SHOULD sacrifice that stone if the sequence gets to that position (move 9), but there is no need for such a move. 
See the variation.];W[qe];B[qd];W[rf];B[md]C[Lately I've felt like it's better to let the S15 stone die in favor of gaining initative. Given that this area becomes trouble later, any comment on the wisdom of this approach?

Yes, you can do that and here, locally, it't the right thing to do, although you could have avoided this.]

You will learn about this when you reach single digit kyu level, like 9kyu or 7kyu.

My pleasure!
You've got potential. Your mistakes are not big and certainly you are better than 13k. You'll improve fast.
