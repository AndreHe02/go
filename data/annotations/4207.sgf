Any comments would be appreciated];B[dp];W[oc];B[pp];W[dd];B[pe]
;W[qd];B[qe];W[kd]LB[pd:A][rd:B]C[W6 was good, but it only makes sense if you continue by securing the corner at A or B.]
;B[di];W[pj]LB[rd:B][jq:A]C[This stone doesn't attack the two stones above and may end up as a target for Black. A looks like a better way to stop Black from building a huge moyo. B is still big, but if you play it now you will have spent too many stones on the upper side.]
;B[ql];W[np];B[kp];W[pn]TR[ql][pp]C[It's not clear what you are trying to accomplish in this area of the board. Also, White should generally avoid the triangled shape as it gives Black a good move to connect and make points.]
;B[qn];W[po];B[qo];W[op];B[pq];W[lq];B[kq]TR[lq]C[This exchange seems to help Black more than White.]
;W[nn]C[This makes a strong shape, but now you have 5 stones making just one point of territory, while Black has about 18 points with his 5 stones in the corner.]
;B[pm];W[om];B[ol];W[nl];B[ok];W[nk]LB[mm:A]C[This is no good. You are pushing Black from behind along the fifth line. Black gains territory, and the value of your Q10 stone is destroyed. If you develop this group, it's better to move towards the left side. Given Black's lead at this point, you'd really like to tenuki, but then the peep at A could create difficulties for you.]
;B[oj];W[ni];B[oi];W[dk]C[I think you have to play around H4 instead and try to get something out of your wall by attacking.]
;B[cf];W[gc]LB[cn:A]C[It might be better to play at A and give your side group a base.]
;B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dc];B[bc];W[cb]LB[cn:A]C[Way too small at this point. Play A.]
;B[bb];W[eb]LB[cn:A]C[Again, play A.];B[cm];W[bk]C[In some sitiuations this may be an option in this shape, but I think it is too heavy here.]
;B[cj];W[ck];B[fm];W[fk];B[hl]C[Now it should be clear why making a base for this group was so important. Black has control now. It will take something spectacular for White to get back in the game.]
;W[hk];B[ik];W[ij]C[Too much. Just play H10.];B[hj];W[gk];B[ii]
;W[jj];B[ji];W[ki];B[jk];W[kj];B[hi];W[em];B[el];W[fl];B[en]
;W[dm];B[dl];W[ek];B[dn];W[ig]C[This move says you want to sacrifice the group, but it's too late for that. If you continue you should play F11 instead. Seeking complications with H7 might also be possible.
