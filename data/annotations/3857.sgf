;B[pm]LB[qn:A]C[opening sequences always confuse me this response seems to work well with the WO3, BP3, W04 sequence especially with my piece at k4

Xif:This isn't a horrible opening but you may want Black 9 at A to completly secure the corner. White could invade this corner at the moment.(look at the varations]

C[moves like this I like because there is a a lot of room to the left or right and I can do a two-point jump supposing he doesn't directly attach

Xif: This move is pretty good because it prevents a huge top side for white]
;W[nc]C[Xif:This might be too passive for white but I couldn't say with any real authority where white should play I personally would play N3.]
;B[fc]C[or three point];W[kc];B[kb]C[Xif: K3 might be better the F3 stone is still a bit to far and can be invaded at H3]
;W[lc];B[jd];W[lb];B[ka]LB[ed:B][fe:A]C[Xif:This is too small right now as there are bigger points locally and globally A and B would have been better moves at this point. Don't be afraid to sacrafice a few stones in the begining game if you can gain more profit elsewhere]

[cn:D][dj:B][jn:E]C[Xif:This isn't urgent right now I and the left side is looking really big that move was worth about six points. Consider these other moves.]

(;W[rg]C[Xif: Wrong direction.];B[rh];W[nf];B[kf]LB[fe:A]C[would it have been better to hane at Q13?  Jumping out didn't seem to be a bad idea

Xif:I like this move better than Q13 becuase you have a stone at Q10 already and with this move you have a really good move at A]
;W[eb];B[fb];W[ci]C[Xif:See how big this move was worth for white both players should of played here earlier]
;B[ck]C[Xif: Might be better at D9 t be more effective with your stone at D9.]
;W[cn];B[dm];W[cm];B[cl];W[cp];B[co]C[a little to risky for black?
Xif:See the varations. It gets complicated really quick but seems advantagous for black]

;B[er];W[cr];B[dn]C[now he has a small corner and I have a big wall]

;B[mk];W[hl];B[gl];W[gq];B[gp]C[Xif: usually when defending an invastion the last think you want to do is touch his stone becuase it will only make it stronger. this would have been better at E3 where the weakness in your wall can be protected]

(;B[mg]C[Xif:The biggest endgame move is at T13 becuase it is the biggest endgame move at this point so who ever playes there first gets to gain the points. Usually you want to play sente points in general so L16 is also good See white vartion to see white taking the point.]

(;W[ng];B[kd];W[ld];B[ds];W[cs]
(;B[es]C[I seem to have a problem keeping sente when it is important to do so.  did I have better options?

Xif: Nope, but T13 is the biggest endgame move here. just relax in the endgame and read out every spot becuase the moves are fairly limited at this point. So take 20 seconds and contemplate which move is sente and which moves are big and then play them out accordingly. but also once you run out of sente endgames moves play endgames moves that would have been sente for him.]

[sc][sd][se][sf]C[my overall strategy of trying to get my two territories into one and splitting his into four came close but failed.  Close game though.  To close for comfort.

Xif: It wasn't a bad game by either player. I think you could improve by trying to look for bigger moves in the middle game and maybe going over the end game moves a bit. I would suggest taking your time at the end game(take a couple of breaths as soon as you start playing on the first line) and cooly caluclating what moves need to be played first. Your attacking is pretty good at your level however don't rule out playing elsewhere when you feel your group is safe. Also I hope my comments help but I am not a pro so anything I say really has no weight.  If you have anyquestions please email me back. The part about the ko may still confuse you but I think it will help. Good luck with go and good luck with improving.]
