C[To the reviewer: I am 16k NNGS and play white against pcuoq,
currently also 16k NNGS.  He has expressed an interest in getting  comments on the black moves as well.   I would be most interested  in knowing where and when I lost the game
and what could be done about it. I got the feeling that black was able  to play all the important moves first and pushed me around
most of the time. Comments on the opening would be very
 welcome as well.      / Mattias
My impression is, that your opening was quite good.  I will put in two types of comments:
(B) basic mistakes. Those are the moves, which are clearly wrong. If
you do less of those mistakes, you will get stronger quickly.
(A) more advanced things. I would consider it not so urgent for you,
to improve there. Also the (A) remarks might sometimes
rather be a question of taste and not commenting a clearly wrong move.  /Bernhard]
;B[pc];W[pp];B[dp];W[dc];B[jd];W[fq]C[(A) It is considered more urgent to attack against a stone on a 3,4
point. So I suggest Q15. One reason is: If instead black plays R15 he gets a
big safe corner territory. There is no such a safe-territory-making
move for the 4,4 point. Next on the list of urgent moves for you
follows a corner extension like C15];B[dn];W[jp]C[(A) That is the perfect move for white]
;B[pe]C[(A) A very strong move of black. He gets a very strong position on
the top.];W[dj]C[To the reviewer: Would it have been better to extend along the right
side?
(A) That is really hard to say. There were two very urgent moves to
play. The one on the right side, and one on the left side. If you let
black play R10 or Q10 he gets a perfect framework. On the other side
doing something on the left side is also urgent. I would suggest to
play R10 here. There is a saying: "never let your oponent perfect his
moyo."  
Another point: The move C11 would have been much stronger. After any
move in the middle of the left side, you expect your oponent to get
in on D15 or C15. You have to be prepared for that. after D15 or C15  you will play on the upper side (F16), and black wants to make an ideal two
space extension to C12. Having played C11, Black will not longer be
able to play C12];B[cf]C[(A) C15 is better: it attacks the corner more strongly + it makes it
easier to play a two space extension. But: I do not see an easy way
for white to take advantage of this.];W[gc]C[To the reviewer: Is F16 better?
(A) F16 is clearly better. You want to put pressure on an invading
stone. F16 puts pressure on C14];B[ci]C[(A)This does not look nice. White D10 is on an ideal attacking point
(the shoulder hit). That is a consequence of the not so strong move
C14, you played before.];W[qj]C[(A) I would first continue the attack by playing C10. Black
should answer to this. Then you should continue attacking, as long as
black should answer (thats hard to tell, I know). and then you should
turn to R10. Otherwise: R10 is a very good move. Black playing there
would be big indeed. By the way: I consider the opening as finished by
now.];B[np]C[(A) This is premature. The invading stone has no backup by other
black stones; White could take advantage of this by chasing you around
and making territory on the right side and the left lower side. My
suggestions: P10 or C10.];W[nn]C[(B)  1. The right way to attack is from the distance. If you are
getting to close, also your stone will become weak.
2. You should try to build territory while attacking.
3. You should try to keep your stones together. You should avoid
getting to many groups.  Here: Black P5 will separate your stones. After
that you have to weakish stones to look after: Q4 and O6.
Maybe its to early to say, but this looks like a loosing move to
me. Black can now rip your moyo apart and attack you. But it should
be you, who attacks black inside your own moyo. Q6 would be the ideal move:
You build territory on the right + you have only strong groups (in
this area of the board) + black is attacked from the distance.]
;B[lp]C[(A) I would exploit whites mistake immediately: Play P5.]
;W[ln]C[(B) After Q6 instead of M6 your previous mistake would be undone.  One can already smell
that your 2 stones on the sixth line will become very weak. At the end
these two moves will turn out to be wasted moves.
Maybe you think: What is he talking about? ok, my stones O6,M6 look
weak, but his stones on the 4th line as well!
The point is: After pushing through at P5 and L5 black has one weak
group to look after, you will have several weak groups. You will also
need moves to strengthen Q4 and to strengthen K4. So in the fight
between M4/O4 and M6/O6 black has the advantage, as he can use all his
moves for that fight! Black has only one group to look after, which
will become stronger and stronger.];B[oo]C[The next black moves are all good]
;W[po];B[on];W[op]C[(A) You dont want to do this. You want to leave this open.  Reason: You got
two such forcing moves (P4 and O5) Depending
on the future circumstances you will later play the one or the other.
In addition:  With that move you make your own stone O6 weak  (as it is clear how black will answer)]
;B[no];W[qm]C[Good];B[ko];W[kn]C[(A) Because you produced this weak stones on the sixth line, it is hard to
find a good move. At that point I definitely would not add more weak
stones to this group. Play elsewhere! The fight in your moyo is
lost. At least you got territory on the right. Locally a good move
would be L3. If you push from above (L6) Black will also go in this
direction and your lower right group becomes weak. If you push from
the side (K5) Black moves out in the center, and will get to much
strength there. My suggestion: Attack with C10.];B[jo];W[ip]
;B[nm];W[qg];B[mn];W[hn];B[ho];W[io];B[in]C[All the last moves
by both players were good];W[jn]C[(B) Before you make the move try to visualize the position after the
expected answer from your oponent. You will see: Black will answer
J7. After that your three stones will look so weak! They are almost
lost. Rather give them up (or maybe you can use there aji later). J7
is such a nice point for black! And you yourself force him to play
there! Dont force your opponent to do moves which are good for him.]
;B[im];W[kp]C[(A) You make your three stones even weaker now. that takes another
liberty from them. As they are so weak already thats not really very
bad. You should consider them lost.];B[lo];W[kl]C[To the reviewer: In this situation I had been thinking about W G5 for
some time, but I didn't want to lose my L6
group...
(B) The strategic value of your L6 group is really small, they are
rather a burden on you. Try to distinguish important stones and
unimportant ones. The important ones are stones that map out
territorry or moyo, cutting stones, invading stones. I must admit
those three stones look a little bit like cutting stones. But as it is
blacks move now, he could do something for his J6 group, and then the
cutting stones have lost their value.
G5 would be a great move. after that you would have strong groups on the
lower side
(A) locally: White G6 might be better then G5. It also captures  the
black stone. By now I consider the game lost for white];B[go]
;W[mq]C[(B)I am not sure about your intentions here. But I am getting the
impression that your plan might be to kill the black group. So let me
just give some general remarks: The black group is quite
strong. Before your move N3 it has several options to come to live:
(1) it could move out toward the center with O9. (2) it could try to
get a base at the edge of the board. (3) it could try to make eyes
with moves like Q7. (4) it could try to kill your L6 group.

One prerequisite for making a killing attack, is that all white stones
which take part in the attack are strong. Otherwise the usual outcome
will be that one of your weak groups dies, and the whole attack made
your position worse. So in this particular case, the only legal attack
would be softer (like P8) and you dont expect to kill Black.  
N3 really invites disaster. You will be able to save your N3 stone
with O3 or M3 but only in Gote! So black will be the one, who is able
to attack. He will get the initiative. Already now you should do
something to strengthen your weak J4 group (maybe G4).

Or maybe your intention is to connect your white groups? But you
should be able to see, that Black can hinder you. And if you see, it
doesnt work, do not do it.];B[lq]C[Good move. White should realize his mistake now, and give up the N3
stone, and should try to save the J4 group];W[nq];B[gq]C[To the reviewer: I'm beginning to feel the pressure  on the J4 group...
(A) I do not see any way to save that group. The space is to small to
get two eyes];W[kq];B[lr];W[mp];B[mo];W[kr];B[mr];W[or]C[(B) The better move is O2. Maybe you are afraid of Black P2?:
White:O2 B: P2 W: P3 B:O1 W:Q2 B:P1 W:Q1 B:N1 That is much better for
you, then the result in the game! The main point is: You end in sente!
You might have a chance to save your J4 group. If you succeed Black
must do something for his big group. Conclusion: Black should not play
P2 and should rather take sente himself after White O2.  Anyway the sequence starting with P2 is an endgame sequence.  And it is much to early in the game to worry about endgame sequences]
;B[nr];W[oq];B[lm]C[(A) Its better to cleanly kill the white group (e.g. with Black
H3). There is still no reason to worry about your group.]
(;W[hr]C[To the reviewer: Are the following the best moves to make eye space,
or should I have done other things?
(A) Life and death is a difficult story. After H2 (and any other move
which does not  incorporate the F3 stone) the white group is still
dead. But it is asked to much from you, to see this in a game. The
move which might give you some hope is G2. But if I am not mistaken,
even that does not save all of your stones. I have added a possible
variation, assuming Black wants to kill your group.];B[gr];W[hp]
;B[gp];W[ir]C[(A)Now black should cleanly kill your group with H3.  As the L6 group is not
important, black does not need to kill the L6 group.
Correction added later: Now it seems to me, black does not need to
play H3. The white group is dead, even if white does the next move here.]
;B[km]C[To the reviewer: So, I lost the L6 group. My idea was now to build up
strength on the outside. Unfortunately I'm not strong  enough to utilize such strength yet, so it will result in more or less
nothing...
(B) Black is very strong in the lower center. You will not be able to
built thickness (=strength) there.  There is a Go proverb saying: Do
not play close to strength. You should turn to another point of the
board (like P16 or C10)];W[ll];B[gm];W[hl];B[hm];W[fn];B[fm]
;W[fl];B[gl];W[jl];B[jm];W[gj]C[(A)This might look like thickness for white now. But you are not
really strong there. Blacks power is looking through the holes in the
wall (N8,J8,G9). It is like nailing some but to few wooden boards on the
entry of a cave of a strong beast.

By the way: an Invasion like N16 (what you played
later in the game) would be exactly the right way to use your
strength, if you had additional stones on H9 and O9.];B[fk]
C[(B) Black should directly bump against the white stone with
G9. After that black can either play H10 or F10. White gets cut apart.]
;W[fj];B[ek];W[ej]C[Now you got a nice wall. well done.];B[cq]
;W[ck]C[(B) C10 would be better. It has the same good effect towards the
lower side, and it is attacking C11];B[cd];W[cc];B[bc];W[bb]
;B[bd];W[ed]C[To the reviewer: I was trying not to get pushed down on the third
line. Perhaps an invasion around O15 would be good for me?

(A) This is a small move. There was no danger, that black might push
you down on the third line. If Black plays D16 you still can play
E16. If Black plays E16 you have to push through with D16 and have to
fight.  
Answer: O15 would not really be an invading move. It would just be a
reducing move (Black would still play O16 after O15). I guess the most
promising way to invade is: You start with a peep at P16. Black plays
Q16. Then you play M17 or around there.
But you are right: Now is the time to invade];B[ib];W[ic]C[(B) This is not good. You cannot attack against a knights move
like that. K17 will give black a strong position. Pushing through the
knight move is only good in special circumstances (like if you can cut
effectively). If you must defend: defend with H18. But better: invade
immediately as long as both sides of blacks framework are not strong
yet.];B[jc];W[hb];B[id];W[ge];B[hc];W[gb];B[gd];W[fd];B[hd]
C[(B) White has given Black a good shape. An invasion gets much more
difficult now.];W[md]C[To the reviewer: Based on the result: Is this invasion too deep? O15
instead?  Answer: N16 is not bad. If anything: it is a little late, after you
helped strengthening Black in the middle of the upper side.]
;B[nc];W[lc]C[To the reviewer: N14 instead?
Answer: M17 is not bad. I would have played N17, but that is probably
a matter of taste];B[mf];W[nf]C[(B) Attaching is the right idea. But you got two sides to
choose from. One of blacks most likely answers is N15. You would then
follow onto line 15. Now try to visualize the two possible positions  after these three moves (starting with O14 versus starting with M14).  You will see: M14 would have been the right attachment.  After White M14 Black N15 White M15 your stones are connected.]
;B[me];W[ne];B[nd];W[mg];B[ld];W[le];B[mc];W[lf];B[md];W[og]
C[(A) as you have noticed, you cannot defend both cuts: O13 and
M13. You will have to defend one cut, and then allow the other cut,
and you will have to give two stones then. The best is, to accept
that. Now: The O14/O15 stones are less important (If black catches
them his area on the right side will not increase by much). The best
strategy is: Defend with M13 or L13. E.g. W: M13, B: O13, W: O12, B:
P13, W:P12, B:P14 W:J14. Think in your games about positive sequences
like that, if you have to give up some stones! If Black wants those
two stones, give them to him, but use it to make forcing moves, to
build walls.];B[lg];W[kg]C[(B) as above: It would be far to expensive to try to save your
2 stones. Rather: Give atari from the other side: M12, and then
L12. This might give you some territory on the right side/center.]
;B[lh];W[mh];B[il]C[(A) Thats a mistake by black! White should not defend his H8
stone. The ladder starting with N11 now works for white! But that is
hard to see. Try to read it out. The trick is: as soon as black has
played K10, white should no longer chase him in the same direction
(i.e. giving atari from K9) but rather chase black towards your three
stones with J10 and later J9. thats an example how to use walls, even
if in that case, it is only a weak 3 stone wall.];W[hk];B[ik]
;W[kh];B[li];W[kj];B[ki];W[jj]C[To the reviewer: Is there no way of stopping B M11 group from
connecting?
Answer: One problem is, that black can catch your M14/M15 stones
whenever he wants. He could play L14 (W:L15, B:K14, and the stones are
lost.) It might be better for black, to keep this sequence in reserve, like
he did in the game. So maybe your only chance, to start a fight with
the aim to catch the black
group is to play K14 (after black played K11). But if Black answers
strongly, you will not succeed, as you have to many weak groups. And  your loss will even be bigger. So the whole idea to chase the M13 group did
not turn out well.];B[ji];W[ij];B[jg];W[jf];B[if];W[jh];B[ih]
;W[hg]C[(B) This seems to be a type of move, which might be typical
for your personal playing style: You realize, that your group is lost,
but it has still some Aji. You utilize that Aji immediately, by playing
a move like H13, forcing Black to capture. After that the Aji is
gone. You trade your Aji against one stone on H13.  Sometimes that is a good strategy. But most of the time, it is better
to keep the Aji for later. You might be afraid, that Black might
capture regardless. But that would not be good for Black. E.g. you
make a big move elsewhere (say S15), if Black captures , he allows you
to make another big move.
(A) in this particular situation your best course is: play big moves
elsewhere. As soon as you got some Ko-threats, play J13. Either black
plays L15, then you play H12 (and save some stones) or black plays
H13, then again you play H12 starting a Ko. If you loose the Ko, it is
not so much worse (compared to the actual game), if you win the Ko,
its quite good for you.
(B) The trouble with your move on H13 is: The move does not achieve
much. The area in the rectangle D-H 15-11 is neutral area, neither
Black nor white will be able to make territory there. So: putting
stones there is not really important. (Well thats not completely true:
your big central group needs to get connected somewhere or needs to
get two eyes. So probably your best move now is C7). What follows is
the endgame. I will not put a lot of comments there: Given that Blacks
lead is enormous, the endgame is not really important.];B[kf]
;W[hf];B[eg];W[ff];B[ef]C[(B) This move is far to small. In principal the white center group
is still in danger. So the best is: Play B7 to take away its
base. White will then need to connect the group to a living group. So
B7 is a big move, with an additional threat. Also S14 is big]

;W[pk];B[oj];W[oi];B[ni];W[mi]C[P12 would be much bigger. Remember: The cut at N11 is no big
threat. You have two ways to connect your central group: N11 or say H11]

Answer: Thats not really true: with your Q14 you were forcing Black,
and also White P15 is not forced (to the contrary: you are hoping for
Black P16, what Black shouldnt play, as it would be to small)]

group...

The irony is: Your group is still dead. In fact I dont see any move,
to save your group.

(A) Black could still kill your group: first K1 (white has to answer
L1) then H3 and your group has no chance to get a second eye.]
;B[gs]C[(B) If you see a way to kill white (= to not allow two eyes),
then you do not have to fear a move like G1. White will not get a
second eye with G1. K1 would have been correct];W[ks]C[they are alive now! congratulation]

;B[tt];W[tt];C[To the reviewer: Black wins by 65.5 points...  Quite a comfortable win.
(B) Let me try to summarize your main mistakes:  Often you are sticking to long at a local fight (e.g. one you have
already lost). It would be better to take the initiative elsewhere.
I have noticed that you were quite willing to sacrifice single
stones. Thats a good attitude, you are not doing the common mistake to
answer every single atari. But: Extend this attitude also to bigger
groups of two or even more stones. Sometimes you defended a lost group
for to long, making your loss even bigger. Think about it: If you do
not defend that group, you get a big move elsewhere. If your oponent
want to make things safe, he might capture your endangered group. But
that would mean, you get another big move. Two big moves in the middle
game might well be worth 20-30 points. So: Treat your lost groups
lightly. There might be chances to save them later on or to use their aji
later, but do not
immediately try to save them.

Also: My impression was, that during most of the game, you dictated
whats going on. Your oponent didnt push you around. But you didnt find
a good way to use your initiative. If you review the game, you will
notice: Most of the times, you did a move, which your oponent had to
answer, not the other way round. I would say, what was missing in your
game, were the big calm moves, which mapped out big areas, or
extended your areas (example: the big move S15 which you could have
made during most of the game). Maybe that is to harsh. Sometimes you
did calm big moves.

One more point (maybe the most important one): Try to watch out for
weak groups. Try to avoid producing many weak groups. Make your moves,
so as to strengthen weak groups (or connect weak groups to stronger
ones). This is not always the most important thing to do, but my
impression in this game was, that you didnt look enough after your
weak groups.

Please: if you have any questions about my comments, dont hesitate to
ask: send me an email to herwig@ruf.uni-freiburg.de. especially, since
it is always possible, that there are mistakes in my comments.]
