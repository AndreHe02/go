C[Dear reviewer. Thanks in advance for reviewing my game. This was a relaxed game that I really enjoyed. But I have some questions about it. I have added some in the SGF.

XCM: Yo, i'll do my best to answer any questions. I'll also add comments wherever i think they're necessary.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[po]C[XCM: Hmm, fancy. You probably know already, but it's not good form to attack a corner when there's still one corner wide open. However, seeing as it's a relaxed game...]

;B[ro];W[oq];B[pm]C[This move suprised me a bit as I thought S7 to be joseki. But this seems better for black. I think I'm missing something here.

XCM: Black does not need to play S7, he will win the semiai either way. 

Exercise: actively count liberties in in capturing races from now on.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[so];B[rp];W[rr];B[sm]C[XCM: See? Black had no problems after all...]
;W[dd]C[I thought that taking the open corner was bigger then defending the lower right.

XCM: Yes, it's big. The lower right doesn't need much defending for now, it's quite safe. What you want to focus on at this stage i building a good front for a battle in the centre.]
;B[no];W[np];B[oo];W[op];B[mo];W[lp];B[gp];W[dn]C[XCM: Hmm... seeing as the G4 stone is so far away, i think D6 can be placed a bit further off. C7, or D7 seem better...]
;B[cj];W[cg];B[bm];W[bn];B[cq];W[dq];B[bo];W[co];B[bp];W[an]
;B[dr];W[er];B[ds];W[fq];B[cm];W[cn];B[ip];W[br]C[Is killing the corner actually big enough at this point?

XCM: VERY big. Imagine if black played there. Now White has lost about 10 points and is floating around the centre. Granted, white won't be easily killed, but you REALLY want to keep your baes intact.

I think Black made a judgemental mistake here; the corner seemed more important than the G4 stone.]
;B[bs];W[cr];B[fc];W[dc]C[XCM: Hmm, i don't like this choice of joseki. It give black the chance to play aroung L16 (which he does), and that gives black a semi-secure swathe of territory. 

D17 would be better placed as a pincer, around J17. J17 as a wide pincer seems nice, as it isn't readily killable...]
;B[jd]C[XCM: See? pretty intimidating...];W[ej];B[ch]C[I figured that since black had 2 weak groups so I had to attack. but this move caught me off gaurd. Any advice here?

XCM: Black is stronger than you think here. He still has avenues to escape.

The textbook response to C12 would be a white hane at D12. This will give you more influence into the centre (a good idea, since black's walls around P6 are strong), and it keeps black confined to the West.

See variation]

;W[kn]C[Looking back i'm not too happy with this point. Is there a better point to attack?

XCM: Actually, it's not so bad, as it isolates the G4-J4 stones from the right, which is strong. The only complaint i have is that the wall to the left (around E8) has too many weaknesses for my liking. Other than that, you now seem to have a very large swathe of territory at your command.]
;B[el];W[fl];B[dm];W[fm]C[XCM: Nice to see you understand the necessities of sacrafice.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[iq];W[jr];B[im];W[kl];B[hk]
(;W[gk]C[XCM: No, this move is not necessary. In fance, it's almost bad. Black cannot cut off those E9 stones, so there's no need to defend.

Remember, never make contact when trying to kill; it just forces them to make thicker and stronger shape. There's a proverb: "Kill from afar"

I think I would continue to run into the centre with L10. Why? 

This is one of the great strategies behind Go: you don't have to kill to benefit from the attack. When you play L10, and black runs with J11 or something, you can use your string to reduce black's potential rettiroty to the East.

See variation.];B[jk];W[kk];B[mk]C[XCM: Ah, the missed opportunities...]
;W[il]C[I think this move is a mistake now. Just getting black's tail only made black's moyo stronger.

XCM: Yes, good observation. Remember, playing contact moves serves  to make your opponent stronger. Be VERY CAREFUL when considering contact moves.]
;B[hl];W[hm];B[hn];W[gm];B[jl];W[in];B[jm];W[jn]C[XCM: Well, if nothing else, you've claimed a huge chunk of terrritory!]
;B[km];W[lm];B[ln];W[lo];B[mn]
(;W[qf]C[XCM: Hmm, this attack... you'll have to be very careful, now that black has a HUGE influence around R9

I'm thinking you can still do damage in the centre. Let's take a good look at the tengen...

Go back 1 move - See variation.];B[kj];W[nc]C[I was happy with this double approach but did I miss something in the center?

XCM: Go back, see variation.

Black is almost guaranteed a huge chunk of the East side. White will live one way or the other in the North-East, but it would almost certainly be small compared to black.]

XCM: Yes. It's possible to go as far as R11, though.

C[I thought black had too many ko-threads to play the ko.

XCM: You're probably right. Good judgement on your part.];W[rg]

;B[oi];W[rk];B[sb]C[XCM: Ack should've saved the corner, it's worth a significant number of points...]
;W[ng]C[I was looking for the best way to reduce black's moyo here. I didn't want to invade at H17 yet because it would solidify black too much.
I decided to mess around K10 a bit first before invading the top.
This move was a probe in preparation for my next few moves as it breaks a few ladders from around L10

XCM: You will want to look for reductions that are not only big, but leave you with sente (ie, the initiative). 

You're right to leave H17 for now, it loses the initiative.

K10 is definitely useful, i believe. But the biggest reduction I can see would have to originate from the white leaking out at F10. You will have to play strategically far enough so that you are safe and cause maximum rediction. H13 springs to mind.

Other than that, to be frank, this looks like blacks game...]

XCM: Not bad at all, just a few oversights on black's side, and your reduction is big.

Could've been better with the ladder though...];W[hc]C[XCM: Good timing.]

Thanks again for reviewing my game.

XCM: Overall, this was a pretty good game. Black made more mistakes than you did, so you won.

Here are some tips:

1/ Practice reading out sequences. Don't just stick to one sequence, find as many favourable permutations as you can

2/ Remember the fuseki/joseki fundamentals (i'm sure you know them already). Corner-sides-centre, play so that all your stones work well together. Choose the right joseki to fit your situation.

3/ Life & Death. I didn't really see any big problems, but practice makes perfect!]

;B[on];W[oj]C[XCM: BAM! Even larger reduction.

This is what i mean when i say you don't have to kill to benefit from attacking. The J7 stones may not be dead, but they're not accomplishing much either (ie, not much territory). In contrast, you are attacking, reducing, winning!]
