;B[qn];W[qp];B[pn]C[I didn't know where is a good answer to W12, so i decided 13 could be usefull with watch to the right side ... What is a better answer to W12 ?

The right side does not need strengthening at the moment.  I would prefer c13, making territory in front of your corner enclosure.]
;W[ef];B[fd]LB[cf:a]C[Here i was not sure if it is better to play 15 or at A ... or maybe somewhere else ?

e14 is an overplay, and while f16 is very good at protecting the upper side from invasion, (a) or one space below it is superior because it weakens the stone on e14 and makes a small amount of secure territory at the same time.]
;W[cf];B[fq];W[eq];B[fp];W[hq];B[dn]C[Would i be better to  run out here instead of playing 21 ?

This isn't unreasonable. If he defends the side, you can run out lightly to f7 or g7. But how do you deal with e5?]
;W[cn];B[mp]C[The weak invading group in the lower left needs to be defended before starting another invasion.]
;W[nq];B[mq]C[I would prefer to leave this as a forcing exchange and play g7. If you want to play again in this area, o4 is stronger, working well with the framework above.]
;W[hn]C[The invading group is under strong attack, and this move strengthens the weak white group below.]

;W[mh];B[mj]C[o11 defends in better shape and makes the potential eye at p12 false, and prevents him making an eye at o13 by playing n12. This is your losing move!]

A little early! You have a large,secure territory on the upper side. The bottom right corner can be invaded, the bottom left corner can live and connect to the f3 stones by playing e2 and the central group can connect above by playing at any of the points around l15. Don't be discouraged too soon!

Enjoy your Go!!
