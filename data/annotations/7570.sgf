C[Hi, I'm Silvan 6k on kgs.  I would say the areas I need to work on most in this game are invasion and reduction. Since I am not very sure how I can improve these skills I am hoping for a review that will assist me in those areas.  Thank you in advance for your review.

Hi, My name is Gus, I'll try to see if I can help. My comments will be preceeded by Gus: (except when I forget :) ).]
;B[dd];W[pp];B[dp];W[pd];B[dj];W[qj]LB[fc:A][pj:B]TR[oj]C[Gus: This move is somewhat questionable in my mind. The two previous moves by you radieate power and influence and this stone has a third line territorial focus. I couldn't find a single pro game with these first 6 moves, but 811 pro games with the first 5. Of those 707 continued with A and 93 at B. This makes sense because both of those moves easily continue ina a manner that builds a moyo, and are therefore consistent with the first two white moves.. You metnioned invasion and reduction... the triangle is now left as an ideal reduction for black, or in other cases shouler hits above or below B might be useful reductions, often the reduction will come right after a 3-3 invasion leaving you with neither corner nor moyo.]
;B[nc]C[Silvan:  I wasn't sure whether the right approach was to pincer or to extend at Q14.

Gus: I don't like the pincer see variation....];W[lc]C[Silvan: I ended up pincering]
(;B[ne];W[pf];B[kd];W[kc];B[jd]C[Silvan: Is it better to extend again or to do a one space jump?  I was worried if I extended that he would hane and I would have trouble living.

Gus: see variation for joseki...]
(;W[ic];B[jc];W[jb]
(;B[ld]C[Gus: Black misses an oportunity here...];W[hc]C[Gus: This is good. I don't know if you saw black's oportunity or not, but solid like this is correct, now your group is stable. The result is slow, but you've fixed your defect so it's only a few points lost. Once you realize you have a problem fixing it immediately (or abandoning it immediately) is usually the best policy. Accept the loss and fight to get it back. leaving a weakness through the game,  will usually create a strategic problem that makes it impossible to fight strongly. over a large portion of the board.]
(;B[he]C[b has a lingering weakness now.]
(;W[jq]TR[qj]C[Gus: Looking at the whole board, what is the situation? Black has enormous influence but w has not created any true territory.  both stones are low which is helpful for territory, but that territory still has to be realized. In this situation I feel like w must combat black's influence now.]
(;B[nq]C[This seems slack. Sure it works but b has better options than to jump into an area only 5 lines wide. W should welcome this line.]
;W[oq];B[np]
(;W[on]C[Gus: Overplay];B[kp];W[jp];B[ko];W[fq];B[fp]C[Silvan:  I was very unsure of what the best response was.  My first instinct was to wedge at E4 but I felt like that might put my two stones at K3 in jeopardy.]

C[Silvan:  I was a little unsure at this point what the best way to invade his territory would be so I attempted to make territory.]
(;W[ng]C[Gus: This move is possibly a little slow but lets count up the board:

W has:
Bottom L: 20 pts or so.
Right side 25 pts or so.
Top: 5 pts.
Invade at c17: 5pts.

W Total.... about 55 pts.

B has: 
About 35 pts above his wall.];B[lg];W[lk]
(;B[jl]C[Gus: slack.];W[ec]C[Silvan:  This move seemed right in this situation but on further review if black had played D16 it looks like a poor move because looks difficult to jump out very far into his territory.]

;B[qa];W[ob];B[pc];W[oc];B[cd];W[bc];B[bn];W[cg]C[Silvan:  Is it possible to make this live?  Was there a better invading move?  B15 seems safe but small.]

Gus: declaring it dead in all cases is beyond my ability, but I will say that there are many better moves than this, and It does seem surpising that it lives. This play generally isn't viable once the marked stones (or similar) are in place...]
