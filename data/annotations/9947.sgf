C[J: Hi my name is Jay and I will be reviewwing you game. My comments will start with "J:".]
;B[dp];W[ce];B[qp];W[pd];B[qf];W[nd];B[pj];W[op]C[J: P4 is actually too close. When black pincers, white's stone is int a 1v3 situation.]
;B[lp];W[on];B[qn];W[ol]
(;B[ql]C[J: R8 is too soft. Here, black should play Q7 to gain sente to protect the bottom. See variation.]
;W[iq]C[J: J3 can also be at J4. High moves are for fighting, low moves are for territory.]

(;B[lm]TR[ln][lo]C[J: M7 is a little thin. White can look at the weakness in the two space extension later. Another option is to make white a stick and let it squirm. See variations.]
;W[oj];B[pi];W[fq];B[hp]C[J: H4 emphasizes the outside, but black has to determine if the strength here is useful enough to give white territory in compensation.

J: Simply playing D6 is also ok. M4 and M7 are then light.]
;W[hq];B[fp];W[gp];B[go];W[gq];B[fo];W[dr];B[lj]TR[lm][lp]C[J: This shape is very thin.]
;W[lo];B[ko];W[mp]
(;B[mo]C[J: N5 is unreasonable. Simply playing M6 is fine. See varation.]
;W[ln]SQ[kn]C[Misread a simple ladder here. I should have played at L6 (the square) instead.]

(;B[mn];W[kn];B[km];W[jn];B[np];W[mq];B[no];W[nq];B[oo];W[mm]
;B[oq]
(;W[ml]C[J: White can also choose to pull Q4 out. See variation.]
;B[or];W[lq];B[jm];W[im]C[J: White has a lot of cutting points.]
;B[kp];W[kq];B[in];W[jo]
(;B[il]C[J: Black missed a good opportunity here. K4  would make white's life miserable. See variation.]
;W[hm]
(;B[kk]C[J: K4 is still possible.];W[oi];B[hn]C[J: H6 is a waste.]
;W[io]C[J: Black misses their chance.]
(;B[gm]C[J: Black can catch white in a net at G8 to avoid the ladder. See variations.]
;W[po];B[pp];W[nn];B[op];W[pn];B[qo];W[oh];B[ph];W[of];B[cg]
C[J: Interesting direction.];W[dg];B[dh]
(;W[ch]C[J: C12 is probably an over play here. The normal shape is D14. See Variation.]
;B[df];W[eg];B[cf]
(;W[eh]C[J: E12 pushes black from behind. Instead white can try a move like F11 to break both ladders. Though, extracting H8 too early may not be wise. See variations.]
;B[di];W[ei]MA[hm][im]C[Perhaps I should have taken the two stones here.

J: Perhaps, but the mistake was made earlier.];B[dj];W[hl];B[hk]
C[J: The proverb is "Every step in a broken ladder is worth 7 points." It might be wiser to make shape at J9 now.]
;W[gl];B[fl];W[gk];B[hj]TR[jl]C[J: Black's aji at K8 is painful.]
;W[gj];B[hi];W[ej];B[dk]C[J: It doesn't feel like white gained too much locally.]
;W[ef];B[de];W[ee];B[dd];W[ed];B[dc]C[J: It's painful for white to have to give up fourth line territory to attack a group that's nearly alive.]
;W[ig]C[Wasn't sure how to respond to this attack. E17 felt unbearable after J13.

J: K9 is easy life for black. See variation.]
(;B[ie]C[J: J15 is unreasonable when the center group is under attack. If black was aiming for a sacrifice, F17 is enough. See variation.]
;W[jh];B[lg];W[lh];B[mh];W[li];B[kg];W[jj];B[ki];W[kh];B[hg]
;W[hh];B[gh];W[ih];B[gg];W[gi]C[J: The moves here locally are a loss for black.]
;B[gc]C[Here I simply decided to give up the centre and take the top.

J: G17 means that black wants to start another group on the top side. White can still cut at E17.]
;W[je];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd];W[le];B[ec];W[if]C[J: J14 is small right now. C3 and S16 are very large.]
;B[he]C[J: Black can tenuki.];W[cp];B[cq]C[J: Black needs to besure that white can't live with C5 after black's C4. See variation.]

(;W[dq];B[co];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[rd];W[gd]C[J: M17 looks bigger than this.]

(;B[fd]C[J: Black can save the G13 stones with G15. See variations.]
;W[fe];B[fc];W[hf];B[ge];W[gf];B[mc];W[ld];B[lc];W[pg];B[qg]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[qc];B[ob];W[do]LB[fm:A]C[I couldn't read this fully so I let him take. At the time I was concerned about the F7 Cut (a). There was probably less reduction than if I had simply connected.

J: Good instinct.];B[dn];W[ep];B[em];W[ao];B[bm]C[J: B3 you'll see in textbooks as the correct shape sometimes. Here, B6 saves 2 points.]

;W[od];B[pc]C[J: H5 is bigger now.];W[qd]
(;B[qe]C[J: Taking the corner with R18 might actually be a couple points larger.]

[gh][kg][lg]C[J: So the summary of this game is that black missed a lot of opportunities at A/B/C in the opening and middlegame that resulted in white coming up even. The nail on the coffin is letting black die needlessly in the center, the fruitlessness of the marked stones, and some endgame mistakes.

J: The take-away from this game should be to develop a plan in the opening and middlegame; and that there's still a lot of practice needed in reading. Thanks for showing me this game.]
