C[David: I did badly in this game, and as far as I can tell, it was because I didn't know how to invade properly, and because I didn't know how to reduce my opponent's territory properly.  Please show me some moves I could have considered during the game, and let me know when I played dumb moves!]

(;W[pf]C[Per: This normally played at N17];B[qk];W[fp]C[Per: The idea of reducing black is good, but it should be at G4 instead.]
;B[do]C[Per: Now the white stone is too close to black's strength and black can attack at H4 later.]
;W[qm];B[qh];W[mc];B[lc]
(;W[mb]C[David: This ends in gote.];B[lb];W[nb];B[ek]C[Per: Black should have extended from the M17 group white now has a chance to attack.]

(;W[fc]C[David: Should this have been somewhere else?

Per: Yes (see the previous variation)
With this move black is allowed to make a base for the weak M17 group and pincer the white stone at the same time.]
;B[hc]
(;W[cc]C[Per: Entering the corner might not be so good when black has E9.]
;B[cd];W[dc];B[ed];W[ec]C[Per: F18 makes better shape in the corner]
;B[ge];W[df]C[David: A risky move, as the C17 group should not necessarily survive.  Is there a better way to handle this invasion?

Per: Black is very strong and has made a big moyo, but white has three of the corners. I would probably try to reduce instead of invade. Somewhere around G10 seems okay.
Invading at D14 is hopeless and most likely the losing move.]
;B[ef];W[dh];B[eg];W[be]C[David: This is probably stupid.  I doubt I could save the invading stones.

Per: This just hurts you corner];B[bd];W[dg];B[eh]C[black could probably kill the corner invasion now, but he is ahead anyway, so can afford to be careful.]

;W[qg]C[David: Any comments on this move?  Should I rather have responded directly to F2?  How do I quickly judge the size of moves in the midgame?

Per: You where right not to respond to F2.
I would play this at S13. With R13 you are just inducing black to play Q12 and getting one step closer to make a huge center area.]
;B[ph];W[pl]C[Trying to expand my moyo here.  Maybe I should have run out into the centre around O13?

Per: O13 dosn't work since black can cut it off, but you are right that it is important to reduce the center. Around K10 seems possible maybe deeper since you are behind.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[nk];B[nj]C[David: I should have pushed one further here.]

(;W[hq]C[David: I should have pushed one space further.

Per: Yes, actually you should continue pushing several more times.]
;B[mk];W[nm]C[David: What should I have done here?  Black already has a firm grip on the centre, so I guess it's a bit late.]
;B[ml];W[fn];B[em];W[cp]C[David: Is it too late to invade?

Per: Yes. If you want to make one last do or die attack before you resign i would suggest K10 followed by cutting at N10.]
;B[dp];W[dn];B[en];W[co];B[cq];W[eo];B[fm];W[cm]C[David: I didn't know what else to do, I knew I was far behind.  But I know the invasion is dead.]

C[I didn't realize that I had to urgently protect the corner group after this attack, but I came back before my opponent did, so I was lucky.]
