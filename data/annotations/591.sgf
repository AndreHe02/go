;B[ml];W[el];B[pl]TR[kp]C[Black: 76 + 21 = 97

White: 53 + 4 + 0.5 = 57.5

Black wins by 39.5

To summarise.. the main reason W lost was because the W group on the lower half
of the left side came under too heavy an attack.. That could have been avoided by
 * making a base for the group
 * counterattacking the groups that surrounded it, so that they would also be
   weak

If you look at the game.. because that group was forced to make life.. Black managed
to surround it.. creating thickness radiating out from it.. then B managed to use  that thickness to make the large group in the center.

Trying to attack the bottom left corner with the marked stone was a good idea.
But it was too far away from the left side.. so W was split into two weak groups..

Late in the game W tried to cut B in quite a few places.. but chose places where
B was too thick.. and those stones were killed. It would have been better to  try to neutralise Bs center group by extending from the Right Hand Side.. but it
was probably too late by then..

So finally.. Whites major mistake was to not look after a group that was in a strong
B position.. then B got to make thickness by squeezing that group as it tried to
make life.. then the thickness turned into enough territory to win the game..]
