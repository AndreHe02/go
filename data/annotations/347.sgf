[ci];B[cn];W[dn]C[Q: should W play at C5 ?

A: Not necessarily, but B answer is not the best, I think ...];B[co]C[B says : "I should have played D5, as the ladder is good for me"


Yes, indeed.];W[do];B[dm]C["better at B3 ?"

probably better at C4
If W plays E7 now, B will feel the need to respond at D8];W[cp]C[W should play E7 first, it is more important]
;B[em];W[bn]C[This move is certainly too strong, after letting B play E7]
;B[bo]C[B says :"bad move, I should play B7"


No, B5 is correct, B7 would be very bad because of w B5. C7 would be better. But B5 is correct and gives access to the corner]
;B[bo];W[bl]
(;B[cl]C[Still B7, see variation];W[bk]C[why not B7 for W ?];B[cj]C[B says :"I should play b7 here"

Yes, B7 is the key move for the stability of this group and to keep access to the corner]
;W[bj];B[di];W[ch];B[dh];W[bm];B[cm]C[B asks :"CONNECT OR PLAY at D13?

The connection is very big. If B feels that  W D13 is not sente, he needs not play here himself. But BD13 followed by BF15 would give an interesting position on the upper side.]
;W[dg];B[pf];W[lc];B[jc];W[ob]
(;B[pb]C[Wrong move, better play Q17];W[pc];B[oc]C[Q: "Simply play R17?"   Yes, with the M17 stone, you cannot resist this way]

C[This result is terrible for B];W[ge]C[W G4 would be better];B[gd]C[No need to answer G15, better play H3 to try to get back in the game]
;W[fg];B[fp]C[B asks :"Too strong ?"

Yes, it is at the wrong place, as it invites W to split the too groups. Better at H3. If you want to attack the group on the left, hit the group on the right]
;W[fo];B[go];W[fn];B[hp]C[Now, it is very difficult for B];W[bp];B[ao];W
[gq];B[fq];W[hq];B[iq];W[fr];B[gp];W[ip];B[er];W[gr];B[eq]C[Better play D3]
;W[ir];B[hm];W[dr];B[es];W[br];B[dq];W[cq];B[ok]C[Q: "Wrong place, ?Should I reinforce at G8 ?

Yes, you have to reinforce, your position is too weak. Furthermore, locally P9 is not so intersting, because the side is open]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[hn];B[gn];W[gm];B[in];W[io]C[Why play J5 ?  W H7 is more important. If BJ7, then J5 will be W's priviledge. If BH5 then W J7 is possible 5the ko is too much a burden foor B)]
;B[ho];W[gl];B[fk];W[gk];B[fj];W[jn];B[jm];W[gj]C[Bad move, L7 is mandatory. G10 only helps b]
;B[gi];W[hi];B[kn];W[fi];B[ei];W[gh]C[B Asks : globally bad for B ?


B managed to have its left group alive, and right group safe, so in itself, it is a result. But the game remains difficult.]
;B[dk]C[INUTI!
LE.];W[eh]C[B asks :"useless !"

Yes, indeed, this move gets B back in the game];B[kp];W[jq];B[mp];W[lq]

;W[lm];B[jk]C[B says : "because of the H8 weakness, connection at K8 is better?"

what weakness ?];W[mk]C[Now w is beginning a long and harsh journey];B[ki]
;W[lj]C[B asks :"W should play directy J8 ?"

But there is nothing serious at J8];B[ij]C[What is this move ? K12 is probably the only move]
;W[il];B[jl];W[ik];B[im]C[I don't understand this move either. Is B or me hallucinating ?]
;W[ni];B[li]C[Bad move, leaving the cut at K11 as a serious threat. K12 seems still correct]

;W[lh];B[hf];W[ie];B[he];W[je];B[ke]C[What is the problem with L14 ? B is very strong here and should be able to captuer the J14 stones]
