Hello to my reviewer. My main problems were the attack and defense of the moyos that were built, looking at voth sides, but cutting points and big points also played a major role.I think that niether side targeted the big points well and black had the better of the cutting piont exchanges. (note: if any spelling appears to be missing a letter, try t first, my keyboard sometimes skps it). Thank you in advance.


TsuQ:
Hi, this is your reviewer TsuQ. I'll be answering your questions today, and pointing out anything I notice. If you have questions about any of my comments, feel free to email me back.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pp];B[jc];W[qf]LB[je:a]C[considered boshi at A

TsuQ:
While 'a' is a good move in general, it seems much too early to play here in my opinion. It had little relationship to your other stones, deals mostly with the center, and is largely concerning a smaller gap on the board. I think your move here is much better.]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[qi]LB[gc:e][lc:d][cf:f][ql:a][cn:b][jq:c]
C[would like to play A
After kikari at B considering tobi-nobi joseki.
Is C larger than F after tobinobi joseki? D before E, D before F.

TsuQ:
If you like to try to go for big moyo play, you can try skipping s16 and play q10 directly. 'a' would seem like a reasonable attempt to relate the stones on the right side, but of course the left and the bottom sides are much more open and interesting right now.

Concerning answering c6 at d6, you are essentially making a wall of sorts facing the k3 area. This can be quite dangerous if you cannot end with sente to play in this area. Extending from a wall is a high-priority move and in this case k3 works well with Q4 and the structure in that area. It will become uncomfortable for b to enter that area. So I would say C is the best continuation if that joseki plays out in that fashion.

I put some comments in the line given.];B[cn]
(;W[dl]LB[hc:d][lc:c][cf:a][ql:e][jq:b]C[chose one point high for two reasons: most common variation ends in sente(for W), and it has direction towards A. With sente either B or C.
It feels to early for C, but if black gets a double wing formaion on the UR, I don't like it.
AFter A, if Keima then D, acting as C earlier. of Ogema then sansan.
E is gote, but it will settle shape after the corener is finished before first big fight?
 Later: this is the source of the major fight that will be my demise. while still a good move, use with caution.


TsuQ:
What I don't like about this is that it begs b to jump out between your stones. After that it becomes harder to use the right side in creating a moyo with the bottom and the natural attack on d8 works very well with the d16 area.]
;B[en];W[fp]LB[lc:a][mc:d][kd:f][ld:b][md:c][le:e][me:g]SQ[gc]
[cf][ql][kq]C[gote joskei for black
futhre analasys shows paying abcdefg is not sufficient (gote, snall influence) and the other three marked points are better (oba) although A should be played evenually in sente.
Variation shows expected idea.

TsuQ:
You can also consider S17 later instead of a. It is a big endgame move and the weakness at a will likely make it sente. Playing a directly can be troublesome, if b play at g17 in response for example, the 'a' stone will become quite weak and if it runs, b can then turn back to s17 and gains the big endgame, and the benefit of a potential weak group to attack.

It will be difficult to attack the c6 and e6 stones, they are reasonably light and there are many options for b in the corner, b may choose to gain from atacking d8 at the expense of their safety.

If white could move again right now, c14 would be very interesting. L3 is quite good, but right now d8 is under attack, so it seems more urgent to gain benefit from it.]
(;B[gn]LB[gc:f][lc:c][cf:e][df:d][ci:h][ql:i][bp:a][hp:g][cq:b]
C[unsusual. unsure for response
all considered responses marked in order of consideration. A allows 3-3 invasion,but small life. B allows a small recoup sente threat at A5.
Later: Any known method for punishing this overplay?

TsuQ:
This move feels like it is claiming to be performing a splitting attack on the two white groups, however the corner is not very weak. It seems to me there are two answers to consider. If you feel you will be able to make a living group on the left after giving b a move there, play a big move like g, and put pressure on b to try to kill you in a large way to make up for the territory he is giving you. Otherwise, you need to play something on the left immediately toward that end. With e and d, I would be worried about a pincer to try to swallow d8 on a huge scale. I gave a line for my concern regarding h. Maybe a softer approach would be better, say c13. It's quite difficult. F feels like the wrong direction, b may strengthen d16 while pressuring f, and then w has problems on both sides of the corner as well. M17 has potential, but it seems to be ignoring the situation. The problem with the other corner moves, is that an  enclosing move around g might become sente. that would be quite painful.]

[hr]SQ[ql]MA[bm]C[waiting. expecting A. A is not sente, although uncomfortable.
considering sequence marked. squared point is good or one higher. careful of cirled approach used crossed point agaisnt it, if he pushes after kosumi.
If he gets one of the second line triangled points, is it better to approach at the third line or  immediately afer A? it looks really good, but...
Tenuki at B is beter, even if G2 hen G3 begins a favorable sequence, utilizing katabaraki against the evenual O3 by black.
This move obviously lacks fighting spirit though...

TsuQ:
Yes, it's hard to see if a is sente in this case, but b has it for later, and if there is some threat to connect, b might be able to answer it in such a way that a becomes sente.]
(;B[cj]CR[dj][em]LB[ek:A]TR[aj][bj][dk][el][fm][an][bn][gn]
SQ[cf][cg][ch]C[TsuQ:
Ok, let me explain some things about the situation here. White has a weak stone inside of the immediate area of influence of black (the triangled border)  This means that it is in danger of being enclosed. The black three stone group is not being enclosed at all by the d8 stone, it's out into the center of the board. The b single stone has no white stone bordering it at all on the top, on the contrary, it has d16 supporting it. So what your move is actually doing is cutting two strong, arguably living groups with a group which is dying, so it is quite difficult.

Squares are ways you might try to use the aji of the stone to gain something else. Circles are moves which try to use contact for defense. A is the direct running move to get outside this enclosure (which might also help to cut b off in this case.)]
;W[cl]LB[dj:b][fl:a]C[cannot allow connection. after obvioius sequence see variation) if A, B, leaning on the C10 stone. (see variations for details).

TsuQ:
I think the problem here is that you are not entirely aware of the situation (see last move) this move is wasted, and worse makes your stones heavier so it is harder to sacrifice.]
(;B[ek]TR[dk][el][fm]C[unexpected and severe. use aji of D10 with high approach. can fight with hanekomi at D6 if need be. so far treating them light though.
This comes as punshment for lack of fighting spirit with the 16th move.

TsuQ:
Yes in part, also for lack of understanding situation last move. B is merely playing along the line to enclose you.]
;W[df]LB[lc:c][fd:f][md:b][cg:g][ql:d][hp:a][jq:e]C[utilized high approach to avoid a leaning type pincer. A is urgent for W. (Played this first to prevent G right away, gaining too much)
fighting spirit needed to keep up. maybe use Go Seigin like B instead of C.
D is too kind as is E.
Later. Squared point is better, as it counters the possible G play and then can punish at F.

TsuQ:
The difficult thing about this move is that it is unlikely you will be able to live locally but you are deep inside b's influence already. Something like this is needed though, unfortunately it's very difficult now. I would want to make use of the knights move connection weakness at some point eventually, maybe this is a good start. B should get to solidify the top and take sente, lets see.]
;B[cg]C[strange again (although possible), but thwars the goal a bit.

TsuQ:
Yes, this seems wrong. B is wanting to attack your stone now, so contact is bad since it should strengthen you. Have to be careful not to lose the 3-3 while your at it. That could be bad. D12 is a similar move to this which is also annoying. f16 seems the most natural, but perhaps he had some concern about the push and cut at d9.]
;W[cf]C[splitting and gaining from the hane.
Later: wrong direction of play as game shows.

TsuQ:
Yes normally I would be inclined to play at e13 then jump toward the center. If b defends his corner, perhaps you can do that still, but this is now the way you are taking advantage of the corner. If he answers in the corner, further invasion becomes quite tricky.]
;B[dg];W[eg]TR[hp]SQ[fd]C[if the variation is played, then w is cramped for life amd does not do as much damage. Further considering he lower left the triangled point settles W's group and is urgent

TsuQ:
I'm not sure you gain very much if b just takes this opportunity to defend the corner area at f16.]
(;B[di]LB[cc:e][gc:f][lc:g][ee:c][ef:d][eh:b][hp:a]C[gote. every fiber tells me to play a, but all other possibilites are marked too.
after A, then D by B could be endid via a squeeze on the C-D13 stones, which leads to small life for me with im getting heavy, assuming he plays out normally. A feels to be about 20 pts and defending the botom and right will be profitable if he doesn't push too hard, and then I can get into his weaknesses (ie F, G).
I will play A and see his response. two stones is small beans and his attacking strength stonewise looks limited so far.

TsuQ:
In a sense, this is more Honte than gote. B defends all the local cuts again. Now however he has left you an opportunity to do something in the corner. If you don't however, you may find that your stones are still under serious attack. Attacking the corner is potentially sente for you, so I would consider moves which do that first.]
;W[hp]LB[ef:d][qm:b][in:f][pn:c][np:a][nq:g]SQ[fc][ee]C[most probable responses
marked
most expected: A, G
most feared: D
GNU go plays D with little hesitation (not any indication of its goodness though.)
If D then B or G gaining massive compensation for the two stones as E or H is a weakness and my position grows more solid steadiy, the way I read it.

TsuQ:
Square moves are the type of thing that worry me. Once b can make his corner safe, your stones are suddenly on the verge of death.]
(;B[jj]LB[gc:f][lc:c][fd:e][ld:d][md:b][ql:g][in:a][kq:h]C[unfortunately this is good on an Ear-Reddning Game scale( is worth about 30 points!). Unknown response.
explotation of B's weaknesses nessecary soon or immediate alhough G, H are considered, they are too soft.

TsuQ:
Yes, I think you have to play e.

This makes quite a few loose moyo's bigger, it also weakens your three stones further. I think it's inferior to doing something to help d16 for b. A is quite big in theory, but b can still live between it and q4. H as you say seems too slow. The corner is where the action is. F seems too loose since then b can play e and he is attacking both f and the d14 group at the same time. E seems best here, if b plays e15 then you can play the 3-3 point and get a much better result.]
(;W[in]CR[gl][hl]LB[md:a][ql:b][mq:c]SQ[il][hm]C[porverbs say invade one move before the moyo becomes territory. If B gets this or L6, I cannot prevent him at least some territory and I can sill attack from up top later (at A)

expecting a fight.
square points good for either side, circles bad for Black.

TsuQ:
Well first of all, this is a reduction rather than an invasion. Its real benefit is the expansion on the bottom, but as you said, there is still a weakness there. I think b could potentially invade on the bottom and still kep most of his moyo if you press in. The good thing about this however is that b will mostly only be strengthening strong stones if he answers.]
;B[mp]C[its like he doesn't know that that was a massive play he just made.
Later:this is akward but good. it couners the attack's espansion to the right.

TsuQ:
The real problem with this move is that because it's high, it is hard for b to live, and because j6 is high, playing high is a mistake here. you may get to solidify the right side while chasing, and/or leak into his moyo.]
;W[kq]LB[il:a][ql:b][pn:d][qn:c]C[a chance to protect in sente? Taken!

(;W[ql]LB[il:a]C[cannot attack at A right away because of better invasion chances for B.

TsuQ:
This is the right idea, I'd be tempted to play Q6 instead however, because b can become stronger by playing in that area himself.]

weakens the atack massively and gains territory with reasonable secuity except for attacking afer E by white.

TsuQ:
The problem is really that if b gets enough strength here then he doesn't have to worry about these floating stones, which were a liability.]
;B[qq]C[an attack. I can no longer defend the bottom corner and the only gain to be made is by denying it to B.

This is quite an interesting move. If b strengthens you too much, you might be able to attack him wholesale.]
;W[pq]LB[qo:b][nq:a]TR[qi][ml][in]C[aiming at A and simplifying the cut at B.

TsuQ:
This is the right direction. If w becomes too strong outside, b will be in serious trouble. The triangles losely show the framework which can threaten b if w becomes strong in the corner, which is to say, if b becomes a weak group locally.]
;B[nr];W[nq]LB[qo:a][mq:b]C[I played here without thinking. A is better (simpler), although I can sill save them along the bottom. This is the more agressive move and could have some nasty surprises.Treating A and B as maiai is he only plan I see to save them.

TsuQ:
yes, odd move by b. this seems like a sharp answer. I can only assume b wanted to give up the corner attack to keep his stones strong outside, in which case the 3-3 was a mistake (this seems likely anyway.)]

SQ[ll]C[strange again. prepping for attack on  LL? defending with A seems best ams I cannot be cut in the corner and B and C start the large fight.

TsuQ:
I believe b simply wants to make sure this group lives or escapes. This is an interesting way to do so, it's an excellent shape move starting to form eyes on both sides and preventing white from playing here and ruining b's shape for free. It also makes black a sente-ish. If you think the group is still attackable, you probably need to start at square. Otherwise b seems best locally, of course the upper left is still urgent. I don't think there is any danger in the lower left just yet.]
;W[ko]C[TsuQ:
By itself this is quite small, but it may motivate b to run his group.]
;B[km]C[threatening moyo on right or sealing me out of the invasion on the left. variation now has good, if not perfect timing.

TsuQ:
Yes.];W[hj]C[TsuQ:
His last move again made his shape very solid, which makes it easy to cut. You might want to walk slowly, or play in contact at k9 (aiming to cut L7) or j10.]
(;B[gh]C[only explanation i can find is that this is a probe.

TsuQ:
I can only assume he means to make sure those three stones are cut off. this is not good.]
;W[eh];B[cc]LB[ee:a]SQ[gh]C[A thuroughly strange sequence for black . 53 does nothing viable, 51 was too slow and 55 adresses nothing except perhaps a planned cut at A. There are bigger points. Moyo desruction is complete.
Later:Hindsight leads me to believe hat A instead of the game move woud have been much better.

TsuQ:
There are still some potential cuts in your connection, but yes, 53 does not agree with this move, although this move itself is finally addressing the corner. For me right now the most interesting question is the question of the squared stone especially, it has become somewhat weak, and k10 isn't well connected to anything. Something like J11 seems interesting.]
;W[ff]C[protecting against the cut (worth about 15 points)

TsuQ:
Since it also puts pressure on g12 it's okay, but you should realize that your stones have no real eyes and aren't well connected to the side (h4)  at all. I would be thinking about if I could save these, or what I could get from them.]

TsuQ:
It was also possible for him to play around a himself. it would be quite hard to ensure two eyes or escape. Here I think you have to play a to put pressure on the marked stone. Perhaps you can catch it, or make profit on the right.]

Conceptually this move is interesting. If you kill the b group, it could easily come down to who gets the big endgame moves. I think b could do better though, n10 for example would be hard to handle because you can't allow b to kil the n16 group either at this point. Yes d, simply doesn't work, b just makes himself stronger happily. F is potentially quite good. If b is dead locally, it is also possible to consider endgame like s17.
