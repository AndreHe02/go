C[Hi!

I am playing black.

I feel confident that my local play was fair in this game.  However, I simply allowed my opponent to capture more territory.  This was specifically the case in the lower left quadrant of the board.

So my general question would be 'Where did I go wrong?'

-is the problem entirely based in my not having a starting presence in the lower left?

-did I miss a mid-game opportunity to invade the lower left?

-If I had been able to stop the white invasion in the upper right (say, starting at move 120),or elsewhere, would that have been enough to overcome my defecit in the lower left?

-etc...



Also, please see my note on move 189.

Please help me learn from this game!


Thanks!!

Hi,

I don't think there's any single point where it all went horribly wrong, instead (as with most games involving us kyu players) both sides made many mistakes and black's mistakes were just more serious than white's :)

I think the opening went quite well for black, I think more problems arose in the middle game play than any other stage of the game. White's strength on the left side early on is not a problem since it is balanced by a decent black formation on the right.

A major reoccuring problem I saw in this game was one of not knowing when to concede territory to your opponent in order to better defend your borders. You seemed to get overly attached to areas which were not really your territory, and this lost you more in the long run. The best example of this is the white group in the top right corner, which began very small but managed to grow to be quite big by just pushing forward and taking advantage of the cutting points that presented themselves.

There was also a global problem of not recognising where the key areas were and getting too caught up on small points which didn't gain you any territory. In this game the board was pretty much divided along the middle, with both sides having large moyos for most of the game instead of lots of secure territory. The emphasis should have been on reducing your opponents moyo and converting your own into secure territory by closing off the gaps where white can sneak in and reduce its size. So yes, I think there was definitely a missed oppurtunity there, but not neccesary an invasion. I've explained this in a bit more detail in reply to your question on move 189.

I've tried to add variations to the game wherever I think there is a big mistake. My suggestions may be far from optimal themselves, but I hope they are useful in illustrating my points, and that you find the review helpful.

;W[be];B[bd];W[bf]
(;B[de]C[Locally, black has not done well from the last few exchanges. There isn't enough space in the corner to make eyes and this shape is just asking to be cut. Even if white doesn't cut now, you will have to spend another move later to connect the two groups. Also, this move puts little pressure on white at the top, so white can happily just extend to the right and become more settled on the top, while black doesn't really gain anything.

After the next move whites two groups are relatively safe whereas black will have trouble living there in the corner, and will probably have to run out to the centre.

I am not sure what the best move is at this point. My first thought was to play this move at d16, which would protect the cut and threaten the white stone at the top. The problem here is that black is strengthening the white stones at the top in the process of escaping, while not really sorting out the problem with the shape, so this idea is no good. 

I think a better approach may be to sacrifice the stones in the corner and try to build up some influence along the top instead. I'm not sure about how to use this influence though, and what black should be aiming for globally at this stage.

;B[db];W[ee];B[cc]C[Black has managed to live here, but look at how many moves it took! Meanwhile white has built up strong groups on either side that have pretty much closed off the group from the rest board, which isn't very good at this stage of the game.]

I gave it a shot, but it seemed to dissolve very quickly.

Is capturing space in this area even possible for black at this point?  This is a new area for me, so I could use some broad advice.

Thanks!!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
At this stage an invasion is not looking good for black! White basically has two solid walls either side, plus a handful of stones scattered inside, which makes it impossible to live if white plays well. There is very little to space to make two eyes, and no weakness in white's stones, so you are basically relying on your opponent to mess up here. If you wanted to invade you shouldn't have left it till right at the end, and you shouldn't have played all those end game moves, which made white stronger by filling in all the gaps in the walls. These are all weaknesses which you could potentially exploit during a fight.

As for when to invade, I think I probably wouldn't have invaded at all and instead tried to reduce white's territory while it was still quite open. The white stones on the left hand side became quite well settled once white played move 34, and around move 44 it's become increasingly difficult to invade because white can take away your space to build a solid base, and then build up groups elsewhere by attacking as you run to the center, if you do manage to escape at all. After move 90 there is little you can do because the corner is completely closed off, so you probably can't reduce the territory any further after that.]
