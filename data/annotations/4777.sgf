C[
Hi, my name is Stefano and I'm going to review your game. My go strentgh is around 4 k. I write from Italy. 


This is the summary of the review, go through this later.

About the opening:
 - The "high chinese" opening is moyo-oriented, much like the "san-ren-sei", but different from that because it is asymmetric. The center around which to build the moyo is the 3.4 stone. Be happy if White invades too early because you are going to build thickness facing outwards and dictate your will in the rest of the game.

- Avoid playing on a side where there is already a low (third line) stone, do it only as a last resort. Leave it for AFTER the "open" sides (where there are high stones, 4th line or higher) have been "closed". I'm thinkign of move 17 in this game.

About the middle game:
- Always evaluate if you're ahead or behind in territory. In the first case, play safe, continue to build your own territory, make sure that all your groups are safe etc. If you're behind, never mind how tempting it is to continue to build the territory, you HAVE TO go in and destroy your opponent's before.

In general:
- Stick to the fundamentals!! Read "Lessons in the fundamentals" by Kageyama if you haven't yet. It's the best book in the universe!]
;B[pp]C[To reviewer:  Thanks for taking the time to review my game.  This is my first time using this opening (I'm black) so I'm sure I missed some key points.  In summary, I feel like I got behind early and then spent the rest of the game trying to climb out of a hole.  Also, there were some plays that I feel could have gone better, but didn't and I am not sure how to improve them.

C: Of course I will try to help you with this review and try to tell you the key points you missed, but it doesn't look like the best learning policy to me if you submit things you're not familiar with! Most of the things I'm going to tell you, you're probably going to discover on your own by using a few times the "new" opening. But anyway, let's to the review.]
;W[cd];B[cp];W[pc];B[ip]LB[fd:F][qi:D][dj:B][dm:A][qn:C][ep:E]
C[C: This is a good place to point out the directions.

At this point, White will most likely try to prevent the black moyo-building by playing first on the relevant side (left side in this game) by playing at A or B. (A is a special strategy move used to approach the 3.4 stone ONLY in this kind of chinese opening; black usually replies at E, and White takes B; he succeeded in playing in a larger scale than black, even if B is closer to having real territry on the south side. After W B, Black will approach the W cornder around F. Why am I writing this? See the var.!)

White C is also possible, then after B extends White might deploy the "mini chinese" pattern by taking the "skewed" D point, the idea being to make a moyo centered around Q17, inviting B to enter the north side to split the W forces. (see var at move 7)]

(;W[qn];B[np]
(;W[qq]C[C: bad idea for W! With or without the R6 supporting stone, it's like invading under a 4.4 stone: territorially good, globally VERY BAD. The thickness the opponent gets by walling the 3.3 in, is usually far SUPERIOR.

Even just sliding at S4 is better.]
(;B[pq]C[This move was really just for sente.  I thought it could also help me to define my side early on.  Was this a bad choice?  Is there another better variation?

C: This choice is TOTALLY BAD. You are going against a fundamental principle: Split The Enemy Stones. Besides, you're not developing the power you could have achieved by splitting white in 2! See tje var.

Also: Going for sente is not always a good idea. A good place where this idea is explained is "Strategic fundamentals of go" by a chinese author (Guo something, not the famous Guo Juan mind you).

Besides, now you made an overconcentrated group that later White can leisurely attack, using the strength of his lower right group.]
;W[qp]C[C: very easy for W (later on) to play around L4 or M4 to attack the 3 black stones! (not a opening move though)]

(;B[ed]C[C: I'm not sure if B should do first the exchange in the variation, for the lower right.]
;W[df]
(;B[hc]C[C: Why not take the corner? The usual pattern is OK for Black, see var.

High level: probably you're afraid that W pincers you. See var 2 for discussion. The situation is a little different (White 4.4 stone instead of 3.4 stone like in the game) because that is the setting you were probably thinking of. See the other var.]

(;W[lc]C[C: Not very sharp move. Taking profit in the upper left is better.]

(;B[qf]C[C: Locally Yes, but still I'd prefer to settle the E16 group. Heck, it's sente against C16! Always prefer to settle the LARGER groups, where you already invested many stones.

Also: You're not playing in line with the opening you chose. The C4 and J4 stones are crying, hoping to be used. In this opening you have to develop a MOYO around the C4 corner. From that Point of view, I'd prefer to play like in the var.]
;W[qd]
(;B[qi]C[C: This side is so BORING. All the stones are low. Why not play higher?]
;W[qk]C[C: Correctly, White takes the chance to push you against his strong corner. This is almost sente against your group!

That's why R11 was not such a good idea.]
(;B[oj]TR[qi]C[C: Bad idea. Use this shape to ATTACK, not to defend. (because it has weakenss, white can cut sooner or later at Q11)

Besides, I'd jump up from R14, see var.];W[cj]C[C: Even if it would be much better to take away base for E16 black group, this move is still kind of good because it limits your potential to make a moyo around the lower left.]
;B[cc]C[C: Yes];W[bc];B[dc];W[cm]C[C: Wrong side. Maybe possible to plunge in around E3 or E4, but it looks like White wants to develop his own territory rather than reduce yours.  I would not recommend it because black can make a big south side, larger than the White left side.

One must be careful when operating such decisions though: if you think you are going to be ahead in territory, then it's OK to continue to build your own territory, with moves like this White one in the game. But if you think you're going to fall behind, there is no choice but try to destroy the enemy territory!]
;B[eq]C[I was considering the 4th line, but i didnt want it to be too easy to live beneath me

C: Yes, it's OK. It would be difficult to use the high stone anyway, because of the strong C7 and C10 white stones.]
;W[ir]C[Lo and behold...

Could I have handled this better?

C: If you're wondering, then probably the answer is yes. But let's see...]

(;B[iq]C[C: Usually a bad idea to touch enemy stone. See var.]
;W[jr]
(;B[om]C[C: This is a no-no. You're playing against an essentially indestructable White group to the right. This is not sente. Play maybe like in the var]
;W[lq]
(;B[pn]C[C: Does he have to answer you? YES. But is he happy to do so? VERY YES. Better leave for later the option to cut away R9 stone.

By the way, this is an example illustrating the point of why taking sente is not always good: if you were left wondering, think how big an advantage white gets by taking gote here!]
;W[qm]C[C: Now the cut at Q11 shines again. Let me show you the cut in case you were wondering, see the var]

(;B[nr]C[C: I'd prefer to cap. No sense to take away the enemy group base if he can jump out, and by jumping out he splits your groups and attacks you!]
;W[mr]C[C: This exchange is inside for inside, bad for both, but White wasted his opportunity. Now cap at M5]
;B[jc]C[C: This move doesn't make sense at this point in the game. 1) Your group is not weak.  (B18 option always open) 2) This move does not make weaker any White group.]
;W[le]
(;B[ek]TR[bc][cd][df]C[C: You cannot hope to make a moyo in the center.. Besides, the marked (D14) group is oh so weak. You could probably go in and attack at C12 or D12.]
;W[dk];B[ej];W[lo]C[I neglected this move for too long..paid the price.

C: yes.]
(;B[oe]C[C: See the full comment on the next move before wathcing the variation]
;W[nd]TR[oe]C[C: Here you play another exchange where you just make your opponent stronger. If you're ahead, it's proabbly OK to play like this, but the problem is that you're behind!! Now go and see the var 2 moves ago for an idea on what to play!]
;B[dh];W[ch]TR[dh]C[C: Same comment for this exchange here (White happy)]

(;B[bo]C[C: Bad move];W[bb]C[C: Good move. Don't you see that playing here was much more sente for Black than B5?]
;B[ff];W[gq]
(;B[in]C[C: If you have to run away in a purposeless way like this, then just sacrifice 2 stone, it's much better...  2 stones are just 4 points.

If you really want to save them anyway, there was a much better way to defend, see var]
;W[ho];B[io]C[C: This is like a dream for W... it's too easy for him. He succeeded in making a new heavy, weak black group. He's already ahead, with a new weak black group the endgame will be very easy for white.]
;W[fr];B[er];W[hq];B[lm];W[pj];B[pi];W[oi]
(;B[rj]C[C: What is this move? You need to extend to O10!];W[ok]
;B[ln];W[nj]TR[nd][oe][ch][dh][in][io][ip][iq]C[White ending up with a ponnuki leads me to question whethere or not i could have done a better job here. However, I feel it was necessary to connect my weak groups.  Perhaps a better move that suits all my needs?

C: It's insane to leave the enemy do a ponnuki like that. Now the game is OVER, if it was not already after you played the O15 and D12 exchanges, and made the heavy J5 group, which was ultimately the cause you could not run away with the P10 stone and let White make the ponnuki.

And besides the R11 groups is still weak.];B[je]C[C: Why are you neglecting the R11 group??]
;W[eh];B[fh];W[fi];B[ei];W[gi];B[eg];W[cg];B[ii];W[rh]C[I ran away from this fight..Should I have?

C: You could do something better, but there's not a lot of difference for the result of the game at this point]

;B[kb];W[lb];B[go];W[fo];B[gn];W[em];B[gl];W[jj];B[ik];W[ij]
;B[hj]C[I think its fair to say the endgame begins about here.  Is there anyway for me to make up lost ground?  I feel my end game could have been better.

C: No way to recover. I'm not even going into the end game. My advice is that you should get a better grasp on the fundamentals and focus on the opening and midgame first in order to become a better player.

I made a comment about the move #129, but otherwise this is the last comment. Now go at the beginning (move #0) to read the highlights of the review. Thanks for following.]
