AB[pd][dp]C[Hello,
my nick on KGS is twold so I'll start my comments with [twold\].

This game was interesting with lots of possibilities for fighting but there hasn't actually been any fight and oftentimes the answers seemed too submissive even when fighting was fully possible.

The other problem with your moves is that you follow your opponent around, answering everything he plays, even when that move has no value at all. Try to look at whole board _all_ the time, not just when you have sente (actually, more often then not your opponent plays pretty bad move, so you actualy do not need to answer it and so you _do_ have sente :-) ).

Also, sometimes you tried to save useless stones that have no value, creating a weak group that accomplishes nothing in the process, just gives your opponent a target to attack.

Last but not least, you (and your opponent) missed some pretty urgent moves (like killing a big group!) and instead played something unimportant (sometimes not even big) elsewhere. Remember: URGENT before BIG.]

trask20 [3k\]: hi];B[dc];W[de]C[donmatito [5k\]: yes not really blitz]
;B[dh]C[trask20 [3k\]: but fun]
(;W[cc]LB[fe:A]C[[twold\] This is not joseki. White is just helping black get stronger. Compare with joseki white at A.]
;B[cb];W[cd];B[eb]
(;W[fd]LB[dd:C][ed:D][ee:E][fe:A][cg:B]C[[twold\] The correct move for white was at A (also compare with variation at move 5) or B, because this move can be cut. However, there are lots of possible variations and it gets messy soon. For some of them see continuations at C, D and E. Also black can play elsewhere and exploit the cut aji later.]
(;B[gc]C[[twold\] Little too submissive. But the cutting aji is still there, so it's possible.]
;W[dj];B[fh];W[bi];B[bh];W[ci];B[ch]TR[cc][cd][fd][de]C[[twold\] Very bad moves from white. He wanted to attack the black group, but he only succeeded in making it strong and his own marked group weak because it can't make eyes on the side anymore.]
;W[eg]
(;B[eh]LB[di:A]C[Instead of connecting here, you might have tried something fancy like A. This is ok, but it's always painful to let your opponent dictate what you have to do.]
;W[bb]
(;B[da]LB[ba:A]C[[twold\] Bad. A is correct.];W[ba];B[ca]LB[ba:A]
C[[twold\] Why did you play here? This only gets one eye (for a group that doesn't need it yet) and one point. Tenuki was the only correct move. Of course, this is all result of not playing A.]
;W[cn]C[C3 way too nice I think
[twold\] Not sure what you mean. C3 for white is certainly overplay. C3 for black is horribly passive.]
(;B[dl]LB[cl:A]C[[twold\] Good general direction (attacking white) but bad spot. Try A.]
;W[cl];B[cm];W[bm];B[dm];W[bl]C[[twold\] Black gained nothing. Made white strong and created weak stones.]
;B[co]LB[dn:A]TR[dl][cm][dm]C[[twold\] Bad move. Black is easily cut after this. Correct play is probably A (if you want to save the marked stones) or play elsewhere and just sacrifice them (they have no value anyway).]
;W[dn];B[en];W[bn];B[eo];W[do];B[ep];W[em]C[[twold\] This cut is bad because the three stones are totally unimportant.]
(;B[el]LB[fm:A]TR[dl][cm][dm]C[[twold\] Bad direction. Again, the marked stones are completely useless and you have no business saving them. White group on the side is alive so they are not attacking anything. They are also not making any points. They'll just make great target for white to attack if you keep adding stones to them. So just sac them with A.]
;W[fm];B[fl];W[gm];B[fj];W[gp]LB[go:A]C[[twold\] Overplay, can be cut at A.]
(;B[gq]C[[twold\] Again, too submissive. Try to look for ways to attack the opponent's shape and cut and fight. Only if it's not possible play the defensive moves like this.]
;W[hq];B[fq];W[cp];B[cq];W[bp];B[bq]LB[hp:A]C[[twold\] Why not cut at A instead? Looks more interesting than living in gote, right?]
;W[gl]C[[twold\] Completely useless move. Can you tell its purpose? I can't.]
;B[gk]C[[twold\] Why answer? What should this move accomplish?]
;W[ip]C[[twold\] Good, finally a move that makes some sense.]
;B[ho]C[[twold\] Interesting peep.];W[go]LB[hp:A]C[[twold\] And a nice answer! Notice that connecting at A would be horrible for white. So he plays flexible and light instead.]
;B[hn]C[[twold\] However, this move is not good. It just creates weak group.]
;W[gn];B[jn]C[[twold\] Do you really think the marked stones are doing anything (in particular, attacking white)? They don't, right? Why save them then? :-)]
;W[hp]LB[il:A]C[[twold\] You forced white to connect and made your stones even weaker.]
;B[il];W[lp]LB[hk:A]C[[twold\] So what's the result? White got framework on the bottom. You got a weak group in the center (later white can cut at around A). Everything because of saving the two useless stones.]
;B[gd]C[[twold\] Is this sente? Hard to tell. White can probably live. See the continuation.]
(;W[nc];B[lc];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pc];B[qd];W[qh]C[[twold\] Another overplay. The white group at the top is almost dead.]
(;B[od]LB[ne:A]C[[twold\] This might work, but it's too direct. See variation at A.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[ld]
(;B[mc]LB[kc:A]C[[twold\] Bad move because it ends in gote. Should have been at A.]

C[Here I feel the game is close, I have a few points but SE is potentially larger for white... I fumbled on how to deal with this, I think the 3-3 would have been the simpler option

[twold\] How can you talk about points at this stage? I see one white group that is almost dead (the top one) and another one (in the corner) that is not settled yet. One of them should die if black attacks correctly. So this is certainly not a place to play.

However, for a play in this area, see the continuation at A.]

(;B[qg]C[I was not so confident in my reading... but I think it is useless

[twold\] Very much so. See variation.];W[mh]LB[or:A]
(;B[nh]LB[or:A]C[[twold\] What does this move do? I'd go for something like A.]
;W[mi];B[ok]C[[twold\] I don't see any purpose in this move either.]

;B[nj]C[[twold\] This threatens the white group but I have a feeling that it wasn't played with that purpose at all.]
;W[mj];B[mk];W[lk];B[ml];W[ll];B[lm];W[jj];B[be]C[[twold\] Very crude, can't work like this.]
;W[bd];B[fe];W[ac];B[hr];W[ir];B[gr];W[mm];B[nm]LB[hk:A]C[[twold\] What is this for? Should have connected at A instead.]

C[[twold\] Horrible move. White could have tried to kill one of black's groups with A instead.]
;B[he]C[[twold\] Again no purpose in this move, just blindly following the opponent around.]
;W[hi]LB[hh:A]C[[twold\] Too direct, A was better for white.]
