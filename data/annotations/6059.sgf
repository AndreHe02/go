C[i play white and i want to know good my go really is!! i only started two weeks ago and i want to see where my problems are

>You're playing OK well for having just started, and do a pretty good job of protecting your stones.  However, in this game I think black was (generally) playing better and probably should have won.  I will try to explain that via some comments for both you and black.  In some cases I have provided illustrative variations.

MY MOST IMPORTANT GENERAL COMMENT IS THAT YOU NEED TO BE MORE CONCERNED WITH MAKING TERRITORY!

Jan Steen in the Netherlands has a new website for go beginners: http://321go.org/?ln=uk.  I recommend it very highly.  Another one is Sensei's Library, mentioned later in this review.]
;B[cp]C[>Small note: it is generally better for beginngers to play on the 4-4 point.]
;W[pd];B[dd];W[pp]C[>This four-corner opening is standard, and good play for beginners. You were wise to choose the 4-4 points.]
;B[nq]
(;W[fd]LB[gc:B][oq:A][ec:B1][jd:B2]C[>Better to play at A, where you simultaneously strengthen your lower-right corner AND put pressure on black's stone.  Try to find moves that serve more than one purpose.  They tend to be better.

If you want to play in the upper-left corner, B would be better than where you played because it's harder for black to move "under" it (under meaning closer to the edge), and also it's easier for you to expand to the upper-right corner, where you already have a stone.  If you play at B, black would defend somewhere to the left of it (like B1) and then you could play at B2.

See variations.];B[fc];W[ec]LB[gc:B]MA[qf][mc][dj][oq][pj]C[>This does not accomplish enough for you.  It doesn't stake out any territory (points).  All it does is put local pressure on black, which he returns by putting pressure on you.  Up to move 19, black strengthens his stones with every move.  

If you want to play in this area, B is better (joseki).  

Or you could consider any of the points marked X in order to stake out territory.]
;B[ed]C[>Here is what I mean about black getting stronger:  he has two stones connected.  Your two white stones are cut (separated). You respond reasonably well but after every move black gets stronger.

Both of you make a line of stones, essentially, but black's are starting to enclose a territory because they're facing the edge. Yours, facing the center, do not.  You can see this clearly by move 19.]
;W[gc];B[fb];W[eb];B[gd];W[fe];B[ef];W[gb]C[bombora: :s];B[ee]
;W[ff];B[ei]LB[lq:D][jd:C]MA[gd][fc][fb]C[>OK, you've disposed of two of black's two stones marked X but his position along the left side of the board is stronger than yours across the top.

What will you do next?  C helps consolidate your territory on the top.  D attacks black's stone in the lower right.  D is probably better because it is sente (black has to respond), but either would be OK.   

Incidentally, you need to be careful about black's other stone marked X.  He probably can't save that stone but for the time being it is alive and still placed well enough to cause mischief.]
;W[eh]C[>This move is not "big" enough -- in other words, it doesn't do enough to help you make territory.  It is not even a sharp enough attack on black.  

After move 24, black's position on the left side is even stronger and white has made a pretty big stone formation without claiming any territory.]
;B[dh];W[eg];B[dg];W[fg]LB[ih:F][jd:E]MA[gd]C[>Good, because black would play here if you didn't.  You should play that out to see how bad that would be if you allowed it. This demonstrates the troubling effect of black's X stone.

White now has 10 stones in this part of the board.  They are strong enough to have potential but they don't yet claim any territory.   You should be looking ahead to moves like E, and later F, to make territory in this general area.]
;B[qp];W[pq];B[op]MA[qq]C[>Black should have played at X.];W[oo]
;B[np]
(;W[po]MA[qo]C[>Your move is OK, but X might be better.  Imagine the shape that makes for your stones: that is called a "fish mouth".  For all practical purposes it is as secure as the solid connection you have made but has the advantage of being "faster," in this case extending your influence faster toward the lower right edge AND allowing you to threaten black's single stone on the next move if he does not reply immediately.  Then, when he defends again, you attack again and, in the process, strengthen your position. That is how go works.

See variation.];B[dk];W[fi]LB[ih:F][jd:E][qo:G]MA[pj]C[>Unfortunately this does nothing for you.  You are just building a longer line of stones.  You need to use their strong potential to enclose territory.  That is important.

However, it is not yet urgent.  Important and urgent are not necessarily the same thing.  You need to play at G to protect your stones in the lower right corner, put pressure on black, and make a platform from which you can later move at or around X and make territory on the right.  

Later you can move around E and F, as mentioned before.

If black was a better player he would start playing on these points and win the game handily.]
;B[ej];W[fj];B[fk]LB[jd:E][ih:F]C[>Notice how much stronger black is getting on the side!!!

Basically all the area to the left of black's stones will become territory, except for the top part of the upper-left corner which white should get.

White's big line of stones is safe and will almost surely live. But it is not making any real territory until you play some other stones to the right of them, like at E and F.]
;W[gk];B[qe]
(;W[fm]LB[qd:I][jd:E][ih:F]MA[qe]C[>I think you should have defended in the upper right corner right away, such as at I.  

See variation.

The move you play does not really threaten black.  He answered, but a better player would have ignored it and pressed into the upper-right corner.  

Black's X stone was a good move.  If he cannot expand into the corner from there, he will expand down along the right side, making a little territory for himself and making it harder for you to make territory using your stones in the lower right (whose potential is in the same area).  

If you stop black from doing this, he will move into the corner where is is easy to make territory.  From the corner he can push leftwards across the top and thus minimize whatever territory you can make with that long line of stones.

Any elementary go book will tell you it's easiest to make territory in the corners, harder along the edges, and hardest in the middle. One of the problems with your big line of stones is that their potential is in the middle.  

OK, let's continue...];B[dm];W[go]LB[eq:J]C[>I still think you should take care of the upper-right corner!!!

But if you were to play at J instead of where you actually played, that would be a better move for that part of the board.  It would give you some hope of making territory along the bottom edge and/or connecting upwards, after black responded, to your long line of stones.]
;B[gp];W[hp];B[fp];W[fn];B[fo];W[ho];B[gn];W[hn]LB[gm:K]C[>Your idea is sound but "wrong way".   You have two ways to enclose black on three sides, and you picked the wrong one.  By playing at K instead, you would put more pressure on black and be able to connect to your stones above.

Please note, however, that your priority is wrong:  you need to take care of the upper right-hand corner!!!]
;B[gm];W[hm];B[gl];W[fl];B[hl];W[hk];B[il];W[jm];B[ek]MA[fn]
[fm][fl]C[>Now black has cut off your three marked stones and has a better platform from which to hassle your other stones in this area.

With proper play, black has a won game at this point.  Fortunately for you, black later makes enough blunders to undo his advantage.]

(;W[jl]MA[il][hl][gl][gm][gn]C[>Very good!  Had you played somewhere else and black played here, you would not be able to stop his marked stones from marching into the vast open center and and right side, making territory there.

See variation.];B[ik];W[ij];B[hj];W[gj];B[hi];W[hh];B[gh];W[fh]
;B[en]LB[jk:X3][ii:X2][jj:X1]SQ[gh][hj][hi]C[>Totally unnecessary for black.

If I were black I might have played at X1.  You would have to defend at X2.  Black doesn't care about losing the three marked stones.  He will move next at X3 and push into the open center and right side.]
;W[jk]LB[im:M][em:L]C[>Good for you: this contains black's stones.  It was stupid for black to allow this.  If he plays at L, you capture at M and the save your three stones that should have been dead.]
;B[qd];W[pf]LB[pc:N][qc:N1]C[>Better to play at N instead, defending the corner first.   N1 would also be OK.]
;B[qf]LB[pe:P][qc:O]C[>If I were black I'd play O or P instead.  O pushes further into the corner, claiming territory.  To separate the two white stones with P is more of a fighting move.]
;W[qg]LB[pe:Q]C[>Should be at Q.  Otherwise, black will cut there.

An excellent go proverb states, "Opponent's best move is usually my best move."]
;B[rf]LB[qc:S][pc:R][pe:Q]C[>Black could still cut at Q.  R and S are also possible.

The move black made is called an empty triangle (makes a 90 L-shape). It is generally inefficient and considered bad shape.  You can learn about this in a go book or on the internet.]
;W[sg]MA[rg]C[>You should have played at X.  Otherwise, on his next move, black could play at X and continue extending down along the edge of the board.  You gave him a chance to do this but he wasn't sharp enough to see the opportunity.]
;B[rg];W[rh];B[ri]MA[qh]C[>Black should have played at X.];W[qi]
;B[si];W[rj];B[sf];W[sj];B[pg];W[pe];B[pc]C[>Now it's obvious black will get the corner.  White should try to prevent his extending farther to the left across the top edge.]
;W[og];B[ph];W[oi]MA[oh]C[>A solid connection at X would be better.]
;B[oh];W[nh]LB[qh:T]C[>Black should play next at T, but he misses the snapback you cleverly saw.]
;B[ng];W[of];B[ne];W[pi];B[qh];W[qg];B[ph];W[sh];B[od];W[qh]
;B[qc]MA[kd]C[>Black did not have to do this.  By playing at or around X, black could claim a big advantage.  Because he didn't, you should.]
;W[lc]MA[kd]C[>Your idea is right but X is stronger.  Why?  The move you played is closer to black's stones and farther from your large base of stones on the left.]
;B[ld];W[kd];B[md];W[mc];B[oc];W[nb];B[ob];W[mf]LB[kf:U]C[>Playing at U would be stronger.  Sometimes it's better to play a few points farther from your opponent's stones when trying to make territory.  
When you play too close, it is easier for him to take sente by following with an attacking move that you can't ignore, and then another.  Sente, which means roughly initiative, is extremely important in tactical play.  You should read up on it in a go book or on the internet (http://senseis.xmp.net).

After the move you actually played, black encroaches easily into territory that should be yours.]
;B[nd];W[le];B[lf];W[nf]LB[qo:G]MA[ke]C[>More important to play at X.  If black plays where you did, he would cut some of your stones but basically the formation on the right is safe.  At some point you will have to play a stone at G to make it really solid.]
;B[mg];W[lg];B[kf];W[mh];B[jd];W[id];B[je];W[ie];B[kc];W[jc]
;B[me]MA[ke]C[>Black's move was stupid; should have been at X.]
;W[kb];B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[rn]C[>Good.  Black has made another empty triangle and you are attacking it correctly.  Also, see how your move also supports all your white stones on the right side.  Remember that multipurpose moves are generally good.]
;B[pr]
(;W[or]MA[qq]C[>I like X better.  Can you see why?

See variation.];B[qr]C[>Now black has a chance to live in the corner, although with proper play you could probably kill him.]
;W[nr];B[qq];W[mq];B[oq]MA[mp]C[>If black played at X instead, he might still have a chance, maybe not to win the game but to save these four stones.]

;W[jd];B[qq];W[qo];B[qm]C[>>This could develop several ways, of course, but this variation shows how black and white both make some territory.  This result favors white.  It is usually pointless and impossible to keep your opponent from making any territory.  What you can do instead is let him build a smaller or weaker territory while you build a bigger or stronger one, or at least an equal one.  In this respect the game of go is a continuing balancing act.

What do you think would happen from here?  There would be a battle for the lower-right corner.  Black will probably succeed by making a small territory there.  White cannot make life in that corner (no room for eyes) but can succeed by extending towards the center to connect with his other stones, assuming that group is alive.]
