C[I nearly let opponent get a big enough lower  centre moyo to win

I also played several very defensive moves to ensure life

I think I don't peek and poke enough

General advice on these points welcome

Thanks

inimino: Hi, I have made remarks throughout the game which I hope you will find helpful.  Please let me know if you have any questions.]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[dp];W[pp];B[cf];W[ch];B[bd];W[gc];B[cc];W[dc]
;B[oc]C[inimino: I think E14 maybe bigger here.

The moves are perhaps similar in value, but I would not feel comfortable leaving the C14 group to be sealed in so easily.  W C15, D14, etc seems too good.]

(;W[fq];B[cn];W[jp];B[cj];W[cl];B[ej]C[inimino: I would play a more solid D10 here, as this move allows w to connect under (see var) which might be important in the fight that can be expected to follow.]

(;W[el];B[eg]C[inimino: W can still connect to the C12 stone so this all seems a little vague to me.]
;W[fo]C[inimino: C12 is not captured in a convincing way so it seems to me somewhat surprising for w to play elsewhere.]
;B[dr]C[inimino: The situation on the left side is so unsettled that I think b must play E6 instead.  E6 adds a black stone on the interesting part of the board, while this move is toward an uninteresting edge.  W can easily ignore this move (and should do so).  W can easily play D13, etc, and continue the interesting fight.]
;W[er];B[en];W[fn];B[em];W[fm];B[fl]C[inimino: w apparently made an unfortunate trade of the entire left side for a wall on F3-F7.  This gives b a solid advantage.]
;W[fk];B[dl];W[ek];B[dk]C[inimino: W should like to add a move at G8 now to complete his wall.]
;W[bo];B[cp];W[fj]C[inimino: W seems to make this move instead of G8 perhaps hoping to retain sente, but this removes aji from the C12 stone and looks even worse for w.]
;B[ei];W[qj];B[nq]C[inimino: Immediate invasion is the natural choice.  However, R3 may be safer.  W can obviously play Q3 here after which the future of this stone is uncertain.]
;W[lq];B[no];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[qg];B[rq];W[rp];B[pq]
;W[qp];B[ic]C[inimino: This move seems to be a mistake for two reasons:

First, black is ahead, and should play S2 to make his group alive.  For the group to be unsettled could give white a chance to unbalance the game.

Second, this is too close to G17 and too far from P17.  This can make the game complicated.  Putting pressure on the D16 stones could bring the C12 aji back into play.  This could even possibly bring the w wall at F10 into play which b should avoid at all costs.

I think here black's objective should be to keep the game simple and maintain the advantage.]
;W[mc];B[kc];W[lc];B[oe]SQ[lc][mc][kc][ic]C[inimino: I think black should stick to the new group he created.

The corner is already strong enough, but the two marked groups are weak.  To add a stone to the group on the side seems more urgent.

Of course you do not want the corner to be sealed in but w cannot do that with just one extra move here either.

Play L16 or something around K15, or even G16 instead of this.]
;W[me];B[og]C[inimino: As before, but more so.  The L16 group needs a move.]
;W[re]C[inimino: This is premature.];B[rd];W[qe];B[ke];W[kb]
;B[jb]C[inimino: Given that you have played L15 I would suggest K17 here so as to avoid a cut.]
;W[kd];B[jc];W[jd];B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[ge];B[jf];W[ld];B[lf]
LB[hf:A]C[inimino: H14 looks sente for both and seems more important than this side.]
;W[hf];B[if];W[nf];B[of];W[ng];B[oi]C[inimino: I would push harder here with O12.  However H14 now looks more significant so that limits your options somewhat.]
;W[nh];B[oh];W[ni]C[inimino: This string of stones does almost nothing for black, but white's group is now out and the K18 group even begins to look weak.  I think this result must be the result of earlier mistakes, specifically at J17, M14, and P11.]
;B[lb];W[mb];B[ka]C[inimino: With this, the black group does make life, but it seems painful to play such a small gote move here.  Instead I would try to move into the center first and only make life if absolutely necessary.]
;W[ob];B[pb];W[nc];B[pd]C[inimino: P16 feels more natural.]
;W[kg];B[hg];W[gg];B[ig]C[inimino: H12 would be more natural, this feels much too slow especially after M18.]
;W[gi];B[hb]C[inimino: Another slow move.  Perhaps here black has few other options however after the other mistakes.  Not being able to connect L13 however is painful so it is tempting to try it.]
;W[ln];B[ii]C[inimino: What about G12 here?  It seems there can be some trouble for the white group but only if you prevent it from connecting.]
;W[hh]C[inimino: Now that opportunity has gone.];B[ih];W[jk]

(;B[lj]C[inimino: Much too small.  N11 kills all top white stones, see variation.]
;W[ki]C[inimino: Now the w stones are all connected for the price of only two stones!  L11 was the key point.]

;B[fa];W[da];B[ab];W[na];B[pa]C[inimino: It costs nothing to start a ko, so you should never play like this.  O18 instead and let w find a threat if he wishes to play the ko.]
