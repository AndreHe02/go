C[Please comment in genearal on direction of play in the opening.
Please also comment on what white should have done to reverse the 8.5 point loss.

Elom: Greetings, I am Elom Willson, a 4kyu from the UK.
Thank you for showing us this game; my comments start with
E:

E: I think this is a very interesting game, and a good one to explore the concept of the initiative, and deciding which player writes the rules of play in the game. I'm only 4 kyu, so not everything said may be taken as word, but hopefully you'll find my questions even just a little useful.]
;B[pq];W[dd];B[dp];W[pe];B[gq]LB[cn:A][po:B]C[E: Hmm, I question your opponents sense of direction here a little.

The reason I find it questionable is because when black already has a stone on the lower left, the normal accepted direction is to extend to somewhere around A, giving balance to the overall position.

Better still, I think B is the general direction to go for, as playing a shimari at A and then B can be seen as not working well together. One stone should be linear and horizontal, another expanding vertically and dimensional.

In this situation, not only does black have a stone in the lower left, but that stone is on a "komuku",  meaning that by playing here, black's positon becomes very low, and I would even say concentrated, which isn't what I'd call a positive opening.]
;W[pc]
(;B[od]C[Did not know how to respond here.

E: This is brilliant for white, white essentially obtains a free move.

Black probably shouldn't play so abruptly in the opening stages of the game.]
;W[pd];B[oc];W[oe]C[E: Hane at the head of two stones, this is good for white: black could be wasting time creating what would be a concentreated, worthless, or weak group.]
;B[md]
(;W[pn]LB[ne:X][pi:B][pj:A]C[Is this too far?

Should I have played at A or B first?

E: I think that this move is fine. If white played too closely, black will play at X and it would have been pointless extending to the right, X having been better off.

We must remember that this extension is to strech whites power on the upper side to the right side, not for safety of the strong white group.]
;B[qo]C[E: Interesting.];W[qn];B[po];W[pk]LB[nn:A]C[E: I don't think this kind of safety is necessary; by playing a A, you threaten to remove a lot of black's potential on the lower side, so if black plays on the right, white is happy with a weak stone to attack, I think.]

(;B[np]LB[mp:A]C[E: I don't know whether a move like A is better, or whether black should play somewher else on the board, but this seems slow but good.]

(;W[gd]LB[fc:C][jc:A][jd:B]C[Instead of G16, could I have been a bit more aggressive and gone to A or B?

E: it's hard to call, but I agree that at least if I thought black was weak or prone to white attack, I would have gone further if I wanted to affect black directly. Black's next move looks like a luxury.

However, we could argue that the upper side isn't as interesting as the left, as black isn't very weak on the upper side, and black can make a double wing extention from the corner enclosure, but I can't be fully sure.

If we assume black's upper side group is quite secure, if white plays on the upper side, white should probably play further away from black, making a strong presence. Playing too closely to strong groups invites attacks upon your own stones.

The difficult part is assessing how strong black actually is, for me.]
;B[jd]
(;W[ob]C[E: These exchanges couldn't have benefitted white: you make black's position stronger for free.]
;B[nb];W[nd];B[nc];W[ne]
(;B[lc]LB[pb:A]C[E: This should probably be at A, no doubt.]
;W[ic];B[jc];W[jb];B[kb];W[ib]
(;B[me]LB[mg:B][di:A]C[E: This move is interesting, but I'm not sure if black should play somewhere else such as, possibly, around the A area instead.

As white, I would probably think of playing at B If I play in this area. However, after this move maybe the right side has already become a little smaller, so maybe white could consider ignoring this and playing at A.]

(;W[ng]C[E: This move seems to minisise the white territory, whille allowing black to build influence.]
;B[mg]LB[oi:A]C[E: A is probably the best and safest move in this positon.]

(;W[nh]TR[pk]C[E: It looks safe, but actually it's a problem.

The relationship between two crucial stones is of very bad shape.]
;B[oi]C[E: I don't quite think this works for black.]
(;W[nj]LB[nj:A]C[Is A the right direction?

E: This is hard for me too. As it seems unlikely that white will capture the black stone, I guess the proper mindset is to seek to gain some type of benifit from attacking. But should white atari from the outside or inside?

A seems to only make sense as an "all-out" move trying to kill the black stone. But it leaves cutting points in white's postion too close to the stone being targetted, creating an easy situation for black.

I left a variation of the best I could think of for white.]
;B[ni];W[mj];B[mi];W[mh];B[li];W[nn];B[lj];W[qi]LB[ok:A]C[Is A better here?

E: I doubt that A is better;];B[oj];W[nk]LB[nk:B][ok:A][nl:C]
C[E: The problem here wasn't your previous move, but your willingness to save these two stones.

The big black group may appear weak, but actually, it's very secure as it has an outlet to the center. Therefore, it doesn't matter if black captures the two stones as black was already strong beforehand.

White should block at A, and atari at C after B. If black finally captures, white is happy as white takes sente while black only gains 4~6 points.]
;B[ok];W[nl];B[on];W[om];B[ol];W[pl];B[oo];W[rn]LB[ph:A]C[E: I'm not sure if A is bigger.]
;B[ro]LB[ph:A]C[E: Maybe black could try playing at A first?]
;W[ph];B[lg];W[lh];B[kh]
(;W[mf];B[lf];W[nf]LB[nf:B][lh:A]C[E: The exchanges from A to B seem to help black by removing the aji (potential for trouble, often due to weakness) from black's position, while making black stronger.

Not only that, white should end in gote.

Innstead of playing at A, maybe white could leave that here for later (patiently waiting for the right time for these exchanges; for example, if black is strong or overconcentrated in this area already), and attempt to make a high position on the left side to counter black's influence.]

(;B[kg]LB[ji:A][mm:B]C[E: Maybe it's better off at A or better, peeking at B first instead.

However, black should probably not play here because the center is safe.]
;W[lo];B[mn]C[E: Seems to strech it a bit.]
(;W[mm]C[E: Maybe contradictory to your previous move.];B[ln]
;W[cn]C[E: Since black already has a stone at G3, this eems a bit close, but I don't think it's terrible.]
;B[bo]LB[dd:A][pp:B]C[E:, Normally, this is played when black has both sides A and B. White creates a stick since G3 is in place.

However, this is not the case, so black should probably just pincer at C8; the risk with white's last move, playing so close to black's strong stones, becomes apparent when black starts attacking white.]
;W[ck];B[bn];W[cm];B[dn]C[E: Whoops.];W[co];B[cp];W[do];B[ep]
;W[bp];B[bq];W[bm];B[ap]C[E: white's last move isn't sente.]
;W[dm]LB[fk:A][fl:B][jo:C][hp:D]C[E: This move is slow, as I'm sure you may agree. Playing on a larger scale, possibly with moves around A or B, seems better.

However, it seems more urgent to play moves like C and D];B[jn]
C[E: Since white's last move was almost like a pass move, black get's a free move-- and it was big. Black swallows the white stone and gains much of the lower side without a fight.]

(;W[fn]LB[fg:E][fj:D][ho:C][hp:B][ip:A]TR[jn][ln][mn][oo][po]
[qo][ro][cp][dp][ep][np][bq][gq][pq]C[Looks like Black is really solid in this bottom area here, possibly invasions earlier? or could I invade at A, B, or C?

E: Even now, I think white can still invade at B, but I think white can make more territory than black loses if white tries to protect the left side terriory/ If after white D black protects the lower side again, white can play at E to secure a large amount of profit.

White needs 25-30 points of territory on the left for an even game, and this makes that amount, I think.

This move doesn't effectively catch the black stone in a ladder.]
;B[go]C[E: Interesting-- it seems black thinks it's possible to win by playing calmly from here on, so maybe black believes black is ahead.]
;W[gn];B[hn]LB[ho:A]C[E: I would play this at A instead.];W[ho]

(;W[fo]LB[io:A]C[E: White should probably extend to A first once before playing here.]
;B[io];W[fp];B[fq];W[gp]LB[hl:A]C[E: This move is worthless if black plays at A. White loses liberties without any real gains, it seems.]
;B[ho]C[E: This move is probably barely worth three-quarters of a point.]

(;W[dh]C[E: Seems to be a nice spot, but it's very hard for me to tell what move to play in such a situation.]

(;B[hj]C[E: It's hard for black to make territory in the center in just one move: If black uses some forcing moves first, I think black can win the game, possibly.]
;W[gk];B[hk];W[gl];B[hl]LB[cc:C][he:B][gj:A]C[E: This move doesn't block any territory, so it's worth is not much at all.

Black can turn at A, move at B or beter, invade at C-- all are bigger.]

(;W[hm]LB[ce:A]C[E: This move is very bad. White should probably play around A, securing the territory. The game is pretty much even in that case.]
;B[im]C[E: The same for black's previous move.];W[fm]C[E: White lost the last chance.]
;B[ef]LB[cc:B][ce:C][de:A][cf:D][cg:E]C[Not sure how to respond here..

E: Me neither-- this is an interesting move by black, however, I'm not sure if it's as severe as it should be. A white play at A here seems good and secure. But B is still open, so maybe white should play at C instead. If black plays at D, white can clamp at E, I think.]
;W[ed]LB[ed:X][fd:X][de:X][df:X][dg:X]C[E: I think this is protecting from the wrong direction. Count the number of spaces between the stone you just played, and the left side-- white should probably play on the left.]

;B[fj];W[gj];B[gi];W[ei];B[fi];W[el]LB[gf:A]C[E: I don't see te danger white is pprotecting against; maybe white can just pplay at A and it's a playable game, although white is probably already a little behind.]

;W[fk];B[ej];W[dk];B[ii]LB[gf:A][eg:B][fg:C]TR[cf][df][ef]C[E: I don't see what black is protecting here; on the other hand, protecting at black seems very important, as it doesn't just protect territory from reduction from above; it prevents white from forcing black to wastefully defend around B in sente, by threatening to capture the threee marked stones after A with B or C..]
;W[gf];B[fh];W[bf]LB[bf:2][gf:1]C[E: It's nice to get to play these exquisite 1-2 combinations in a game.]

[so:D]C[E: I think the recent moves in the center of the board-- especially last two moves by black and white-- where examples of slow moves that "pass the time" in a game; A or B seem much bigger. C is probably also even bigger.

However, The area around D is double sente, so both black and white should probably aim to play there as quickly as possible.]
;W[kn]LB[pb:B][ie:C][so:A]C[E: Again, A , Band C seem to be the biggest points for white to play at the moment.

This move ends in gote for white, and is worth very little compared to these two points, as far as I am able to tell.]
;B[ko];W[km];B[lp]C[E: This move is worse than a pass move; not only does black take gote when he should have sente, but black lost one point of territory.]
;W[pj]LB[pb:C][ie:B][so:A]C[E: Again, while this move is reverse sente, it is still gote, and considering the fact that there is a doubl sente-- not just sente, but double sente-- move at A and 4~5 point jump at B, and even a 6~7 point move at around C, this isn't enough.]

Thank you for your help in reviewing this game!

Elom You're welcome
I think that it might be good to become familiar the concept of sente having a value. Every time you lose sente in the endgame, you lose points.

At move 171, after white plays the endgame sequence given for the lower right, the game is probably within 1.5~0.5 points.

20 moves later, black is winning by approximately 4~5 points.

Yet another 20 moves later, and it's an 8 point game.

White is losing little by little by being too complacent in the endgame, or not looking for the biggest points after each move (not being able to evaluate quickly under time pressure could also be a factor). I've heard that Qiu Jun's endgame is aggressive and severe on his opponents, but even by looking at any other pros known for a good endgame (e.g. Lee Chango,) may help show how they would always take strain to take initiative from the opponent and always play fractionally better moves, or count the game and play the safest sequence that works.

Even at other points in the game, it seemed it was black who was deciding the direction of play.

On the other hand, you seem to have a feeling for avoiding weakness and playing strong shapes. Just remember that the move that looks safe (like O12)) isn't always the safest!

Good game,

If black plays at 1, it results in a position in which there is a 50% chance white plays above 1 and has three points, and a 50% chance white ignores black, and black connects, resulting in no points for white. The average is 1.5 points for white.
