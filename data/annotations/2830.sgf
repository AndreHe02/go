C[Hello! I am Quarrel, playing white.  Thanks very much in advance for the review!

Hello, I am Florian. I will do my best do review your game.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qo];W[kq]C[Was this move too far?  Couldn't black have approached at F3 after this?

This move is absolutly correct. It occurs in a lot of pro games. If black approaches at f3, you will play h3.
This  would be very good for you since it would be a pincer AND an extension]

(;B[cn];W[fp]C[This was probably better on the G file right? To close off the territory. 

f4 is the proper (honte) move. g4 would be vulnerable to an
invasion.];B[ck];W[qf]C[Conventional wisdom is to approach from the other side at o17. Black is strong in the LL corner, so will not get much territory along the side. The upper side is much more interesting.]
;B[nc];W[qi];B[iq]
(;W[hp]C[This was actually a misclick and I meant to play J4...was it correct?

This is a very complicate situation. I was not sure what to do and asked some better players. They suggested to play o3.

j4 and h4 are IMHO both playable.];B[jp];W[kp];B[jo];W[ko];B[jm]
;W[nq]C[good];B[ql];W[qc]C[I think this invasion is precipitate. The wall and the influence
b gains is more worth than the 9-10 points in the corner.
I would use this move to extend d16, for example at  f17.

I addet an other standart invasion as variation.];B[qd]

;W[em]C[Normaly you answer at f17];B[dm];W[en];B[fd]C[Probably shouldn't have allowed this?  Too big of a potential area on the top for black?

As I said, play f17 after b c14];W[df]
(;B[cg];W[ce]C[This result is very good for w. The tiger's mouth is a good shape.Black shouldnt allow this. See variation.]

(;W[id];B[ic]C[I was already thinking about those 3 stones as dead, but could I have tried to run to the center?

Yes you can run to the center (for example with h14), but it is 
dangerous. I wouldn play j3. Its better to play elswhere. Thereis some aji which you can use later. If you wish to run play j17 instead of j 16. (see variation).]
;W[in];B[jn];W[im];B[jl]
(;W[rf]C[I don't know why I didn't play to the left of the R14 stone instead...a black move there looks very big.

This move is better than q14. A black move at q14 is very big but since you are not alive it is better to play t15. Look at the variation.]

You are completly rigth :-)];W[ej];B[di];W[ei];B[gk];W[hj]C[good]

;B[pp];W[oo];B[po];W[pn]C[I'm not sure what I was trying to do here..

You were lucky, b replyed wrong. See variations.

A simply move at o6 would be better. But I would play the o19
sequence and the monkey jump at a7 instead of a move around p6.]

;B[ak];W[an];B[ad];W[ac]C[wrong. you have to play b17. Black felt that 14 was a mistake an tried something. But he played in the wrong way. Look at
the variations for the proper way to punish w. I addet a lot
of variations because I found the problem interesting.]

k3 is not so good. Such koÂ´s should be played at the very 
last. Play o1 instead. If b answers you got 1 poined and played a ko thread, if he conects the ko you will got a second
