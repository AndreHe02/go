AB[pd][dp]C[P: Dear reviewer,

In this game I had black with a 2 stone handicap and I won the game by resignation. However, I feel that my opening and my early middlegame were not that good and I am hoping for hints to improve.

Specifically, I am hoping you can comment some of my choices in the opening and if I used my thickness well to attack.

I have included comments at different stages of the game to let you know my thoughts.

Thank you,

Philippe

N: I thought your opening was ok, but I think you're right about the middlegame and use of thickness.

I think the most important moves to look at are 38,48,62,70 and 80.

Feel free to email me or talk to me on KGS if things don't make sense...]
;W[pp];B[dd];W[qf];B[jd]C[P: I wanted to play a game of power with potential for attack as I feel I need to improve this part of my game.

This is why I played this move.

N: This is not the most common answer, but seems fine to me, especially in handicap games. Just be prepared to deal with the double kakari at O17 or O16]

(;W[cf];B[cj]C[I felt the picer extended nicely from my bottom left stone and put pressure on the white stone.

I also did not want too many of my stones in the upper part so early in the game.

Again, my aim was to prepare for fighting.];W[gd]
(;B[ee]C[P: White's previous move left me puzzled as to the best reply.

However, I began a power game and I wanted to stay consistent. This why I played E15.

Alternatives or comments are most welcome.

N: This is the most obvious move to me, keeping the W stones disconnected. Other variations would include attachments to one or the other stones.]
;W[cc];B[cd];W[bd];B[be]
(;W[bc]C[N: This is a mistake by white, see variation];B[ce]
;W[eb];B[fc];W[ec];B[fd]C[N: Very good result for B, W is shut in in the corner and the two W stones on the outside are effectively powerless.]
;W[fb];B[gc]C[P: Connecting for white was out of the question in my mind.

N: Absolutely agree];W[md]C[Again this move left me somewhat puzzled.

But I opted for a different continuation than the one played in the upper left.]
;B[pf];W[pg];B[of];W[qe];B[qd];W[oc]C[P: This move was a problem for me.

Looking back I am not sure I choose the best way with my next moves.

N: The obvious reaction here is to defend against the cut. However, maybe you won't have to! (see first variation)

If you do defend, there are two choices, either the solid connection or the bamboo joint. See the other variations.]

(;B[qg];W[qh];B[rg];W[rh];B[og];W[ph];B[pe]C[P: My aim was to connect the stones and get out in the center. This is why I sacrificed the 2 black stones.

Was this choice of joseki the most appropriate, I have doubts.

N: I share your doubts :) I think the cut was too early and not necessary. As i showed in the variation a few moves ago, you can get the same shape for B with solidifying W much less.]
;W[rf];B[re];W[sg]
(;B[le]C[N: I think this is too early. You shouldn't be in a hurry to attack here, since there are still big opening moves left at the bottom. I would prefer to build up more strength on the outside an then take away the base of the W group.]
;W[kc];B[pc];W[jc];B[id];W[hb];B[oh]C[P: Looking back I do not know if I would play this move again this early.

Any thoughts?

N: Agree, the timing for this move doesn't seem right. It isn't putting pressure on the W group on the right, since it is very much alive, as is the B corner. So it's not really urgent. There are much bigger points on the board, like for example an approach to the bottom right corner.]
;W[dm]
(;B[fp]C[P: I regretted this move, F3 is perhaps better.

N: I don't think it's bad, I think it's the best possible move. Puts more pressure on the W stone.]
;W[hq]
(;B[nq]TR[hq]C[N: Now this I don't really agree with :) Your house is on fire, but you go hunting on the other end of the board! :) I think the reasoning behind your move was to put pressure on the marked stone, right? For that purpose it's too far away and W reacted very well here, I think.]
;W[lq];B[qq]C[P: I thought I needed some definite territory to restore some balance.]
;W[pq];B[qp];W[po];B[pr];W[or];B[qr];W[oq];B[qn]C[N: Especially because you end in gote, I don't think that was a very good exchange. W was able to solidify himself at the bottom side quite easily.]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[bp]
(;B[dq]TR[gb][ic][nc]C[P: Blocking at B5 would split the left side mostly to black in exchange for the lower side mostly to white.

However I did want to let the game become too simple by blocking at B5 since white had a lead in definite territory.

N: I don't think B is really behind as far as territorry goes. The upper side is not all that big for W, because there are many good points for B left there. Same at the bottom, still plenty of opportunity for B to reduce.

But have you really looked at the option of blockin on the outside? First of all, W doesn't live that easily in the corner, and 2nd of all, Black gets that beautiful huge moyo in the center!! While B might fall behind a little bit as far as absolutely certain territorry goes, that moyo will be very hard to reduce for W.]

(;W[bo]C[N: At first sight, I didn't like this move at all, but maybe W doesn't have a choice]
;B[bq];W[fm]C[P: We appear to have started the middlegame.

N: To me, the middlegame started a long time ago :) But I guess it depends on how you define middlegame]

(;B[dg]C[N: I don't like this move. It's too small. There are weak white groups to be chased around!]
;W[fi]C[White is inviting me to separate his stones...];B[fk]
;W[ek]
(;B[fj]C[P: Bumping like this is not the greatest, I know, but I did not see many alternatives.

N: I think you should play the hane (see variation)];W[ej];B[ei]
;W[di];B[eh];W[dj];B[ci]
(;W[fl];B[hj];W[li]LB[lk:A][mk:B]C[P: A good reducing move by white that put me on the defensive.

I am wondering if I could have done better prior to this move.

I feel as though I am almost a prisonner of my thickness and that I do not have many choices for my next moves as I have committed a lot of stones in the upper center.

I wanted to use thickness to attack and not for territory, but now I feel on the defensive.

I judged an attack at A (M9) or B (N9) would probably allow white an escape or counter attack.

N: I would definitely counter attack here. Even if white escapes or lives, B will build up strength and reduce W's points at the bottom. That center territorry may look big, but you can score just as much on other areas of the board.

Of course there are too many variations to thoroughly analyze this, but I gave you an example of what it might look like]

(;B[kh]C[P: So since I commited so many stones I first defend...

N: This is a classic example of using thickness to make territorry. While sometimes this is the only choice (like when the territorry is really big), here I think you'd be better off with a counter attack right away. Count the territorry you are defending here, it's really not all that big.]
;W[jj];B[ii];W[ji];B[jh]
(;W[lh]C[P: This was a mistake by white in my view... too greedy

N: Not just greedy, but also small and especially bad shape.]
;B[hl]TR[fi]C[P: I start with a light play with aims in the bottom of the board

N: Nice move, especially because it strengthens those stones and takes care of the aji of the marked stone]
;W[ho]C[P: From here I slowly take control of the game and go on to win.

However, I think I won mostly because my opponent was too cautious in the next few moves.

My opening was not very good and I am not convinced I used my thickness all that well.

For the remaining moves, I would be mostly curious to know how a stronger player would have stopped my invasion/reduction of the lower right area. I left my comments as thoughts.

N: While this is a big move with respect to the bottom, I don't think the timing is quite right. First, W must take care of his stones in the center.]
;B[no]C[Light play in this area.];W[pn];B[qm];W[pm];B[pl]C[P: My aim is to threatne most of the center around the 4 white stones...

N: Beware of the cut here...]
(;W[ol];B[nm];W[pk];B[ql];W[om];B[lp];W[kp];B[lo]C[P: Maybe a bit heavy, but I needed some good shape, hard to say...]
;W[nr]C[P: In my view a mistake by white

N: I agree, the real action is in the center of the board];B[km]
;W[ko];B[nl];W[nk]C[P: White is mostly reacting to my moves...]
;B[mk];W[me]C[White is defending, perhaps an attack would have been best on my black stones around N9 and below]
;B[lf];W[kd]C[N: These moves I don't understand, looks like endgame to me...]
;B[ke];W[lg]
(;B[kg];W[mf];B[kk];W[lj]C[I felt I could probably erase a good part of the bottom center.

I could probably save enough stones through J9 or O10.

I started on the endgame.

Any thoughts on my reasoning are welcomed.

I am also curious to know if I played the biggest endgame points well. My feeling is that I did better than my opponent in this part.]
;B[gr];W[hr];B[fr];W[qk];B[bl];W[ck];B[bk];W[cn];B[mq];W[mr]
;B[nc]C[P: M6 would probably be better after N3. Mistake on my part.]

(;W[mc];B[ob];W[qo];B[ro];W[hc];B[hd];W[ae];B[af];W[ad];B[bf]
;W[bm];B[ln]C[P: Finally, I get to play M6. To me black should win this game comfortably.

Black won by resignation at move 199.
