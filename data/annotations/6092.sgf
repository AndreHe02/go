C[Hi, I'm James.. 4 kyu on kgs. I was black in this game. I think my main mistakes were k6 c4 and e5. Can you please review this game and provide some comments? Thanks

csh: Hi James. I will try to help you with this review. One thing I noticed is that you did not look to build territory, but instead were relying on destroying all of White's territory.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk];W[jp]
(;B[po]C[csh: The trade here is a small loss, as White gets more from his K4 stone than you do from your shimari.]

(;W[mp]C[csh: This approach isn't as big as extending across the top of the board.]
;B[fc]C[csh: Since he moved again in the lower right, you ended up okay.]
;W[cf];B[jd];W[dj]LB[nc:D][qf:E][cn:B][fq:A][mr:C]C[csh: At this point, the game is pretty even. The bottom is still open, because there are invasion points at A and B. Black can also slide in at C, so the bottom area should not be considered territory. Similarly, White can invade at D or E, so that area is not your territory, either.]
;B[jj]C[csh: This move a little slow. While it looks like it takes over the majority of the board, it's really hard to claim everything between the sides of the board and the tengen as your territory, so usually it's only used as a fighting stone. Since White's area is so open, though, you might be better off playing a move to invade first.]
;W[ok]
(;B[pi]C[csh: This move might be a bit soft.];W[nc]
(;B[lc]C[csh: This attack is actually from the wrong direction. It's easy for White to live in the corner. It's harder if you chase him to the center, where you have extra stones to help you fight.]
;W[qc];B[qd];W[pc];B[od];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[me]C[csh: White got away with a larger corner.]
;W[nd];B[ne];W[mb]C[csh: Because White played this move, Black does not have territory at the top. Black will need at least two additional moves to secure the top.]

(;B[gp]C[csh: This is the start of the problems. The lone stone will be much weaker than the stones to the right. It will be hard to live, and it doesn't have much space to run.]
;W[om]C[csh: White starts to strengthen his group on the right. The stones are all almost connected together.]
;B[qm];W[oi];B[nn]C[csh: The white group will be hard to cut apart. Since the group can also run to the left, there isn't much hope of an attack here.]
;W[ll]
(;B[jn];W[ln]LB[jl:B][ho:A]C[csh: Because of the weaknesses around A and B, there isn't much of a threat to the white group.]
;B[np];W[ml];B[gn];W[dn]C[csh: White is starting to make territory while the black group still needs a base.]
;B[oh];W[ni];B[cl]TR[gn][jn][gp]C[csh: This move is also questionable, since it will be hard to take care of both the group on the left and the marked group on the right at the same time.]
;W[em]C[csh: Splitting the two black groups will make the game very tough for Black.]

(;B[ch];W[db]C[csh: This looks like White has a territorial advantage.]
