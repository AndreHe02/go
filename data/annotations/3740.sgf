(;W[ff]MA[df]C[was this an overplay?

wild : No. If B takes W's D14 seed, W can counter with atari at E13.]
;B[eg]
(;W[hd]TR[fc]C[right/wrong direction?

wild : No. Important move to restrict B's marked stone.];B[hb]
;W[ic];B[ib];W[cl]SQ[cf][cg][dg][eg][ef]C[wild : I feel this move is too near to B's marked group of stones. Anyway, I feel this is not the time to play here. Of bigger urgency is to settle the top left side. Note that B has cut at F15.]
;B[cn];W[ci];B[bj]C[i lost this fight - if possible comment my moves
did i have a chance?

wild : If what you meant was to cut B10 from connecting to either of B's groups, no chance. In such a situation, it is better to connect and run to the middle.]
;W[bi];B[bl];W[bm];B[ck];W[al];B[bk];W[dk]SQ[dj]C[wild : overplay. B can even consider hane at D10.]
;B[cm];W[dl];B[bn];W[cq]C[wild : B can hande at D10, separting W's stones. So this is also an overplay.]
;B[dq];W[dr]
(;B[br]C[i gained here due to my opponent's mistake

wild : Yes. I think the best possible result for B here is a ko. See variation.]

C[wild : Wrong direction. B should not give W opportunity to connect the 4 stones with bottom left group.]
;W[hq]C[wild : Not much effect. Better to connect with 4 stones above.]
;B[jo];W[nq];B[or]SQ[do][ep][cp][cq][cr][dr][hq]C[at this point, i thought i was streching myself too thin and that i was more agressive than needed. please comment

wild : Not really. Given the secure background of W's marked stones. This invasion is sound.]

;W[jp]SQ[ks][kp]C[wild : W overplay. Should just block connection at L1. B could play atari at L4.]
;B[ip];W[kp];B[iq];W[io]SQ[ks]TR[jo]C[wild : Overplay. B could connect at L1 and W still cannot capture K5.]

;B[ks]TR[eq]C[wild : B could have played E3. It's bigger there although W can cut at G2, the 4 stones may be saved by connecting back to bottom right.]
