** Hi, crhohmann.

** Thanks for the oppotunity to rewiew this game. This is dhy4n4[3d\]@kgs.

** Enjoy.];B[pp];W[dd];B[pc];W[dp];B[cf];W[ci]LB[ch:A][di:B]
[dh:C]C[** W[6\]: looks a bit strange, normally the pincer is at 'A', 'B' or 'C'.]

(;W[eo]C[** W[14\]: it somehow puts yourself in trouble. w[d6\] may be better, see in variation.]

(;W[dl]C[** W[16\]: This is an important point but --];B[fm]

(;W[go]C[** W[18\]: bad, because it allows B[19\] --

** w[A\] may work, see in variation.];B[hp];W[fk];B[hm]C[** -- It's locally 6 vs 3 at bottom left, things are turning bad to w.]
;W[dg]C[I suppose that was bad and I should have played B13 instead.

** This move itself is not bad. It makes b's group heavier, and will be useful sooner or later when you start to attack b's whole group.]

(;B[df];W[ho];B[ip];W[bo]C[Intending to rob the b stones of their base.

** This move here is ok.]
(;B[co];W[cp];B[dr]LB[bn:A]C[** B[29\]: big mistake. play at 'A', no need to say.]
;W[bn]C[surprisingly, he lets me connect.]
(;B[eg]C[** B[31\]: Too heavy, see in variations.];W[in]C[** After b[31\] the d14 group still isn't out of danger, while w[32\] makes b's f7 group floating. So W is quite ahead now.

** But actually w doesn't have more territory than b, so  w needs to get enough profit through attacking.]
;B[gk];W[gj];B[hk]
(;W[ei]LB[fl:A][hj:B]C[** W[36\]: This is not a true shape. 'A' or 'B' are still b's sente.]
;B[gg]LB[hf:A][hg:B]C[** B[37\]: Too slow, play 'A' or 'B' instead.]
;W[ic];B[ec];W[ed];B[gc];W[gd]C[** B[39\], [41\]: aimless peeps, only strengthens white. Worths -1 pt each(or less). :\]
;B[kc];W[id]C[** W[44\]: This should be one of the moves you are proud of -- a much pro-like move. :)]
;B[jl];W[kd]LB[mc:A]C[** W[46\]: what is it for? without it you can invade at around 'A' later.]
;B[lc];W[ld];B[mc]MA[mb][ma][nb][na][ob][oa][lb][la]C[** Now you just give b some territories, while you get almost nothing.]
;W[bg];B[ig];W[ii]C[** W[52\]: w's shape in the middle is fragile.]
;B[cg];W[bh];B[dh];W[ch]C[** W[56\]: Not needed.];B[eh]LB[di:A]
C[** w[56\] and b[57\]: bad exchange for white, only makes b[A\] more threatening.]
;W[bc]C[still intending to attack or kill.

** A bit too greedy, b isn't likely to get killed.];B[cd]
(;W[dc]LB[bf:A]C[W[60\]: there are better choices:, w[A\] for example.]
;B[bf];W[ae]LB[fi:A]C[** you should have seen b[A\] before you play w[62\].]
;B[fi];W[fj]LB[gi:A]C[Gambling a little, to preserve my outside connection.

** W[64\] is a must, no other choices here.

** However, after b[A\], 2 eyes are already made...];B[af];W[ad]
;B[be];W[ac]C[** w[66\], [68\]: only saved about 6 pts. there are bigger places other where else.]
;B[pj]LB[qj:A][qn:B]C[I let b build his moyo, believing my overall position is strong enough to reduce it.

** You are wrong.

** Just imagine: if your w[66\] or w[68\] is played at 'A', or 'B' or other places you like, b wouldn't have any chance to build a moyo...

** b[69\], the biggest move ever.

** since w has got nothing through attacking but just are giving b some territory (w[46\], [48\]) and a sente, it's b ahead now.]

(;W[di]C[** w[70\]: too small, only worths 5 pts.

** Here I should tell you(if you didn't know it before): Generally, an opening/midgame move worths about 15 pts. Consider it before you play every move.]
