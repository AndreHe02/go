AB[pd][dp]C[[J\] Hi, I'm your reviewer. I'm not playing particurarly actively now and also of course I'm not a particularly good player so there is no guarantee my advice is sound, but it's the best advice and have and I hope it helps somehow :-)]
;W[dd]C[Kallisti [20k?\]: Hi there! let's see how this goes, good luck!
adamanthar [18k\]: thanks, gg];B[pq];W[nc];B[of]C[[J\] This is a strange move. It doesn't seem to be part of any common sequence that I can find in a joseki dictionary but I can't offer much analysis of why it might be not good. The issue I see with it is that it's helping Q16 create a base, which R14, for instance since it's a common move in this situation, does a bit better. It also leaves the side open, so it's a bit of an invitation for white to invade.]
;W[kc];B[ck]C[[J\] This stone is too far away from D4 to effectively enclose the side. In any case I don't think D4 needs help right now. Your right side is very open still and a stone at Q10 or R9 would help there. White would probably want to invade the bottom side then, but you have a stronger right side to benefit from the invasion.]
;W[po];B[np];W[qp];B[qq];W[qm];B[pi]C[[J\] I think the usual sequence would be to close off the approach white has now in the bottom side at L3 for instance, that stone would also work together with D4 and C9. Note also that your Q11 stone is high while R7 is lower, so it can slide under]
;W[gq];B[fq]C[[J\] White's approach at G3 doesn't put too much pressure on D6, so I think you can afford to deny that white stone base along the bottom with K3 for instance and at the same time settle your O4 group. Sure, white will go next in the corner but you can get a strong left side too from that.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[go]C[[J\] G4 would probably be better for white]
;B[gr]C[[J\] here I would go for L3 is a better choice, I think. It closes the open shape of Q2 and prevents white from setting his group. K3 might be ok too, but you have to worry about a white M3.]
;W[lp]C[[J\] White wants to gives his group a bit of base here, but M4 is too high for that. Maybe too far, considering the G2 stone. Also because M4 is too high it doesn't threaten taking the base of the  O4 group .]
;B[mq];W[ci]C[[J\] White bottom's group is not settled yet, and this is not achieving much]
;B[bj]C[[J\] Solidify here your corner, C6, white could try to invate at C3 still, but I certainly would have a hard time making it successful.  E9 maybe too, so the C9 stone has some help against a possible invasion B6 or C6]
;W[dj];B[dk]C[[j\] it's good to push out, but you are pushing behind now. An alternative move that puts you ahead might be E8. But you don't want to help white to build a wall it can use to keep that top corner (although it turned out alright for you this time later). It seems to me it's about time to start an ivasion of the top while it's still wide open.]
;W[ej];B[ek]C[[j\] still pushing from behind...];W[eo]C[[j\] B5 better? Then you have to either try to cut off and give him a chance to live in the corner or defend the corner and let him connect and ruin that side and put that C9 wall in a bit of trouble.]
;B[do];W[dn];B[cn];W[en];B[ep]C[[J\] you had sente here but gave it back, I don't see what this move accomplishes. Locally you could C7 or give pressure from the bottom with H3, you could get ahead with F10 or take the chance for the invasion.]
;W[qj]C[[J\] now white's group there is a bit more settled and is threatening to take your base from under you]
;B[ri]C[[j\] This doesn't look like a good idea, R11 seems better to me]
(;W[pc]C[[J\] white should avoid contact unless he really wants to start a fight, but that only helps black making your territory more solid. So Q18 seems better to me here for white]
;B[qc];W[pb];B[qb]C[[J\] mmm, seems like it's not needed but at leasts gives more estable base to your group so ok, I suppose, specially considering that white can cause problem around R11]
;W[od];B[pe];W[gc]C[[J\] white has now a nice potential territory here. Now you could get some territory in the left side if you invade but white will build a nice wall towards the centre that is probably worth much more.]
;B[hp]C[Here I started the process to make the white form misfigured and dead. As the game goes on it's clear that I didn't accomplish my goal fully but this was a foundation of my first attack on white.

[J\] That's ok, white left a hole here. Another aproach would be to just deny his base with H3.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[gp]C[[J\] white should have consider here H5 and sacrifiing G3.]
;B[fn]C[I continue an attempt to disallow eyes to form in this formation

[J\] The problem with these kind of behind enemy lines moves is that there is nothing helping this stone, so it helps if you are sure you'll kill or connect somehow later. Oftentimes it's better to harass a group from outside and win territory in the process, than get inside straightaway. If white manages to enclose you it can make it's group stable in the process. 

I was trying some wild variations (too wild and probably incorrect to add to the review) with White F7, they might not make sense but it ends up with complicated fighting that can go both ways...]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[iq];B[fr]C[[J\] i'm not sure what are you trying to achieve here with F2. If you want to avoid an atari with wite H5, which keeps white connected, then play H2 directly or push with H5.]
;W[cm]C[[J\] White should probably settle the shapes here. H5 seems a good idea now.]
;B[bm]C[[J\]];W[bn];B[co];W[bl];B[dm];W[am]C[[J\] now white has a 4 groups to worry about]
;B[fo]C[I start to feel confident in this corner right now.]
;W[bo];B[cl];W[bm];B[ao]C[Here I attact the "cross" formation white made, in attempt to not allow it any room for eyes.

[J\] Here it seems hard for white to live but usually you want to limit the ability of the oponnent to expand it's shape. So if you play  B4 white can't do much.]
;W[bk];B[cj];W[bp];B[bq]
(;W[aq]C[[J\] this was a mistake by white. see the variations, but it seems that white could still live until now.]
;B[ak]C[[j\], ok, one eye less, but c3 is still a worry for black]
(;W[br]C[[j\] this was the wrong approach];B[cq];W[ar]C[[j\] it seems that white is completely lost now, as you saw later the A4 point is vital now, but white can't afford it since it also needs to make an eye in the bottom]
;B[bs]C[[j\] just C2, then either A4 or B1.];W[cr];B[dr];W[cs]
C[Now it's clear that if white get's to play A4, my attempt goes sour.]
;B[ap]C[[J\] well spotted, nice kill :-)];W[ai];B[aj];W[bi]
;B[cp]C[[j\] wasted move, white is dead already. You just gave white the ability to recover some of the points it lost in this corner]
;W[gm]C[[j\] but white helps you with another move that doesn't  seem to do much, now he is pushing from behind]
;B[fl];W[gl];B[gk]C[[j\] good];W[hk];B[gj];W[fj];B[hj];W[hl]
;B[ir]C[[j\] ok, good to steal possible base, but you have to worry about G9 being cut off. If it's cut off then it has to run somewhere and white can push you about and make solid territory of the huge corner in the top]
;W[ho];B[io]C[Here I missed obvious atari

[j\] yep, pity, but happens to everybody :-)];W[hr];B[hs]C[Trying to recoup and form either ko or at least secure my base from this direction.

[j\] this is fine, I'm not sure I'd answer as white, and try to keep securing the group with K5 or K2]
;W[hq];B[gs]C[[j\] no point again in this move, white can't harass you here. white has just made an eye, your J5 seems lost, your G9 could be quickly isolated and made to run towards P14, giving white the whole top corner. You have bigger things to worry about but if you want to play locally K2 seems better.]
;W[jr];B[is]C[[j\] white seems settled, you could give up this stone for gains somewhere else]
;W[jo];B[dg]C[I felt that since there's cutting points in white's wall, there would be room to invade some living space and perhaps kill the wall.

[j\] ok, but in D13 you don't have living space, you can't count on white letting you kill his wall to make the invasion successful, even though it happens sometimes...]
;W[dh];B[ei]C[Still playing my "no-eyes for you" tactics.

[J\] You need to try to make sure white can't run or swallow your stones and make eyes in the process before these kind of tactics. Here it seems that i can easily not go the way you'd like, since you are just asking white to please separate your two invading stones with E12.]
;W[eh];B[fi];W[gi]C[[j\] White should connect instead with D11 and make sure your D13 stays alone]
;B[gh];W[hi];B[fk];W[di];B[fh];W[eg];B[fg];W[df];B[de]C[Here I made the decision to sacrifice D13 in order to gain foothold and influence towards center by connecting my group at F12 and D15, perhaps making invasion towards left side of goban.]
;W[ce];B[ee]C[Here I felt that white is helping me by allowing the connection to be made

[J\] Well, that is fine for white if it manages to connect E13 out]
;W[ed];B[fe];W[ge]C[[J\] White should have C13 or E14];B[cd]
C[And invasion move];W[cc]C[[J\] B15 better response maybe]
;B[cf]C[Decision to make double atari mutual, he gets one group, I get the other.]
;W[bd]C[And the decision was good to me, now I most likely get a living shape towards the edge and can capture white wall below these positions

[J\] Yep, you got more out of this than white];B[ef];W[cg];B[bg]
;W[df];B[bf]C[Now I know I had the upper hand here, just to play it out to be sure]
;W[gf]C[[J\] F16, then play out the ko and white should win some good moves in the process]
;B[dg];W[ch]C[[J\] Dead];B[bh];W[df];B[ff];W[fd];B[dg];W[gg]
;B[df]C[[J\] just A12 instead and settle it];W[hh]C[Now I feel that I have right side, but I'm relatively boxed in. This is something rather common in my games.

[j\] Yes, even though you killed a  lot of white stones, it seems that white has a better position in the board. It is probably too late for the top side, but the middle is still up for grabs for somebody with sente]
;B[ah]C[[J\] oh well. Satisfying as it is, you don't need to kill the group unless your surrounding black groups are at risk. your group is not a risk of being captured by white, why give it the sente back? The left side is settled now. Now the question is how much can the P14 group expand and make. Or how much can white secure by expanding to M14 for instance.]
;W[ij];B[me]C[[J\] yep, good];W[le]C[[J\] white should probably just L15 and not get in another fight]
;B[nf]C[[J\] N14 better];W[mf]C[[J\] white is agressive, L14 better]
;B[ne];W[md];B[pg]C[[J\] Very cautious here, you could get out with ataring N13]
;W[mh]C[[J\] white should probably extend N13];B[nh]C[[J\] N13 makes more gains]
;W[ni];B[mg];W[lf];B[lh];W[mi];B[oi];W[lg]C[Now white pretty much dominates upper side of the board with two facing walls. Meaning plenty of points. All my attemps on this are from now on are pretty desperate attempts to reclaim some of that area in order to avoid losing the game. Now that I'm analyzing the game I calculated this position and found out that my impression on situation of the game was correct, I'm behind by almost 20 points.

[J\] It's seems strange with all the captures, isn't it? but white has a big top side and now a bit of central territory. How much can white secure in the lower right quadrant now? How much can you gain by expanding P11 or O4?]
;B[ng]C[[J\] Don't bother, let white take N13 and O12 and get two big moves in the bottom instead]
;W[li];B[kh];W[ki];B[jh];W[jg]C[Attempting to cut and perhaps gain influence towards center if I manage to kill the wall below my positions. Desperate attempt but I didn't see an other fight worth as many points to fight at this time.

[J\] That's complicated, but I suppose you have to try to get to know what works and what doesn't.]
;B[ji];W[jj];B[kg]C[Here I imply to cut towards top of the board, hoping opponent to overplay defence and allow me to do something else in meantime.

[J\] Try not to count on the opponent making mistakes when defending, they'll but you'll be disappointed more often than not.]
;W[jf];B[kf];W[ke];B[ig]C[And an other attempt, this time to two directions, either to cut of white group at H12 of K13]
;W[ih];B[hg];W[ii]C[This was a move I really didn't see coming. It's an obvious one but I simply couldn't see it which pretty much made my attempts towards center as well as towards top of the board pointless.

[J\] Well, it was kind of desperate to begin with, now all white needs is to secure that big L8 area too, and can maybe put pressure to the 4 group in teh meantime]
;B[hd];W[hc];B[gd];W[he];B[id];W[ie];B[ad];W[ae];B[ac];W[bc]
;B[be];W[ab];B[cd];W[dc];B[af];W[ad]C[[J\] you are playing endgame here  but there are bigger points in the bottom]
;B[pk];W[qi]C[Here was a mistake I made, this hole was not only point of entry, but serious threat to my points in this corner.]
;B[qh];W[qk];B[ql];W[rl];B[pl];W[rm];B[rk];W[rj];B[sk];W[sj]
C[Again misread situation, I thought I would win this capture race.]
;B[si];W[sl];B[sn]C[An other attempt to destroy white formations shape and make it dead.

[j\] well, white has one eye now, at S9, so it's pretty hard, all white has to do is close you in and that can be done while  threatening your corner as well with S4.]
;W[so]C[[J\] This is a mistake by white that black could have taken some advantage of by just playing S5.]
;B[pj]C[[j\] here you can also P9, or even O9 to be able to expand a little more]
;W[nm]C[[j\] bit too far, but right idea];B[nn];W[mn];B[no]
;W[mo];B[oq];W[rq];B[rr];W[om];B[pm];W[pn];B[qn];W[rn];B[rp]
;W[sq]C[[j\] white's mistake but it doesn't make much difference really]
;B[sr];W[ro];B[sp];W[on]C[[j\] white is alive, it doesn't need to connect here]
;B[pp]C[[j\] O9 or M3 for instance would give you more now]
;W[qo];B[op]C[[j\] this is a wasted move again. white can't disconnect O4 and P3, you don't need that stone now there. better O9 or M3. And at least P5 would have earned you an extra point.]
;W[nk]C[[j\] well, he got there first and got at least 3 points out of it]
;B[nl];W[ml];B[ol];W[nj];B[lq];W[kq];B[lr];W[kr];B[ks];W[js]
;B[ls];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[rb];W[rh];B[kp];W[jq];B[lo];W[ln]
;B[mp];W[ko];B[lp];W[kn];B[lm]C[[j\] not sure what you want to do here. the white groups are connected and alive in the center, the right group is alive too and doesn't need to be connected and there is not enough space to make a living shape unless white keeps passing.]
;W[kl];B[lk];W[ll];B[km];W[jm];B[jn]C[Stupid mistake, didn't see that.]
;W[in];B[qg]C[again misread, I should have played S13 instead

[j\] yes, should have played S13 instead of M7 before];W[rg]
;B[rf];W[sh];B[sf];W[ic];B[oo];W[ce];B[nd];W[mc];B[oe];W[oc]

[os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[In the end I didn't lose by much. But I really didn't see that boxing towards right side coming or the cut of my groups on the left. Not making either mistake could have turned the tide towards me. How ever I'm pretty happy overall about this game, since I did manage to fight back and gain some points after the point in which I felt I lost the game.

[j\] there are certainly a number of good points in the game like for example being able to  kill the stones in the left side and spotting the vital points. The thing with fighting is that is very easy to be entirely focused on that and don't look elsewhere where there are still open areas where a lot can be gained, or even make the best move locally. For example,  there were several occasions when the bottom left corner was decided that you could have attacked and lived in the top right and the outcome of the game would  probably have been different.

I think the main thing to focus is to try to keep the initiative. Just try to avoid moves that don't really achieve anything. These kind of moves are just like passing and it seems to me you passed in your game several times.  White won by 2.5, if with every one of these wasted moves you had you managed to win a point instead (and you could have easily secured more than that) you would have won the game.

It was a fun game to review. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about it.]
