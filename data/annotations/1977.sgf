C[
I asked questions where I saw something that looked weird, but please feel free to comment where you see anything worth mentioning.

B: Hi! i try my best. Unfortunatly has my sgf-reader some problems with your file. At some moves you wrote something about "marked stones" which are not marked, but i hope to figure it out. Feel free to send me questions and comments to benni@obda.de. Sorry about my sometimes bad english.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[qd];B[oc];W[pg]C[B: I never saw this move before. It is not one of the common josekis. Take a look at  http://gobase.org/joseki/chap1/joseki.html to see them. But unfortunatly i cant figure out how black can take profit immadiatly from this mistake. So you see, i am not as good myself ;-) But i think the move is just a little bit to thin.]
;B[ld]C[B: maybe this is reasonable because of the thin white move before]
;W[qn];B[ql]LB[on:a][np:b]C[
Is this an appropriate move under the circumstances?  I was thinking that something like a or b might be too passive, giving white too much strength on the right.

B: i would not play it. A is not a good move i think. b or one point below it is the standard move. white has to answer it, so black has sente.]
;W[rp];B[qi]LB[ql:a][np:1][on:B]C[Just protecting stone "a".  But now I am worried about "B" or "C".

B: Yes, thats the reason, why a was not a good move i think. Try to think about your opponents moves in the opening.]
;W[qq];B[pq]C[B: i think this is not a good move. you just strengthen the white group and your q4-stone is not immiadetly in danger. i think it is better to strengthen your r8-group, because this weakens both white groups on the right.]
;W[on]C[B: Now it is the other way around. white has one strong group between two weak black ones.]
;B[mp]C[This looks OK for me.  Is it?

B: No. Your Q4-stone, which was originally played on the 4-4 point to take some influence now just is part of an overconcentrated shape which do not much to influence and is small in territory. Whites group is strong an allive and your r-8 group is still weak.]
;W[qh]C[B: Good move. It strengthen white and overconcentrates black. This move is possible, because the white group below is allready strong.]
;B[ri]C[B: Bad answer. You have to moove in the middle. Later white can play Q-11, which is a very large move. The territory at the edge is small.]
;W[gq];B[iq];W[cn];B[dn]SQ[dj]TR[cn][gq]C[I was quite concerned about whether this move makes sense or not.  Usually one only plays tsuke-nobi if you have strength at the marked side?  I was not sure about that, and I felt that I had to keep the two marked white stones apart.

B:  Sorry, which is the marked side? I dont see this in my editor. And i dont know this saying about tsuke-nobi. I think it is playable here.]
;W[dm];B[en];W[co];B[cp]C[B: I think this is an overplay because of the g-3 stone. The cut at d-5 is much more dangerous with this stone. Just play e-4 instead]
;W[go];B[em]C[What should one do here? I feel my move was not effective.

B: yes, because the d4-cut now it is a really danger. I would play e-3 to make live in the corner, but the result is not good because of the c-4 overplay before.]
;W[dl];B[io]C[B: your latest chance to play e3];W[gm]C[B: white gives you another one]
;B[fq]C[B: another overplay. e3 is better because it covers the cut.]
;W[fp];B[eq];W[do]C[B: finally there it is.];B[eo]SQ[eo][dn]
[en][em]C[OK, was I stupid here, or did he catch me with a clever trick?  I know this move is not very good, as the marked stones are dead already.

B:  yes. it is aji-keshi.white is connected allready. but you are more or less alive in the corner. you can move your center stones with g-8 but that would be not a good move as well, because it would create a heavy weak group. the only thing here to do is tenuki and take the big loss in this corner and hope sometime come back and gain something out of the aji of the e-7-group. but black now is way behind, i think.]

(;B[ke]SQ[ge][he][je]C[At this point I was hoping to kill the marked stones.  Was this too optimistic?

B: I think so. Your own J-13 group was to weak. But of course you should attack the weak white group to gain strength]

B: i am not shure, but i dont see a way for white to kill you, but you gain some points (in gote of course) with this move and if it gives you a good secure fealing, maybe you have to play it.]
