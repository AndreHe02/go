hello reviewer thx for looking at my game
I am white

(;B[pc]C[I dont think this is normal , i would consider the three variations rather.]

instinct

It might be i'm not sure but your move seems fine.];B[qf];W[kc]

LB[fm:A][dr:B]C[i felt this play was unusuall
not sure how to cope best

This is black forcing you to become strong so that you can attack him , he would have done better jumping out at A and then into the corner with B.]
;W[hp]C[Naturally];B[nq];W[lq]C[I'm not sure about this , it splits the 2 black groups but you dont want to have too many weak groups of your own.]

Yeah , it just asking for you to play at n4];W[mp];B[np];W[mo]

It's fine]
(;W[ko]LB[hm:A]C[Another option is playing a move like A , it attacks the black groups on both sides aswell as helping the white group (see varations)]
;B[ln];W[jn];B[dr];W[cq];B[ll];W[qj]C[A bit too far as your group isnt that strong (see varation)]

A: Must defend your group(see variation)
B: Takes the corner leaving black with only space for one eye.
C: Attacks the black group while building your side.]
(;W[dd]TR[qj][rj][sj][ql][pn][pp][oq][qq][rq]C[my w stone up here was not well thought about

Not sure what you where trying , better to settle your groups than create another weak one.

worked out ok though

It is still open to reductions from moves like A and B but your move invades at the right place ( when invading dont go deeper then the line formed by the to edges eg. ( The line of squares)]

(;B[ke]LB[ng:A]C[?

Yes the peep at A is very painfull , only move would be to defend.]

this kind of play is a bit out of my leage to undersatnd at this moment

Well now for the summary , your fuseki was fine , life and death was ok , i would recommend a book if you are interested , "ATTACK AND DEFENSE" ELEMENTARY GO SERIES VOL 5  , covers all kinds of attacking plays like shoulder hits and how and when to invade large moyos , if you want to improve on your fuseki i would suggest "IN THE BEGINNING" ELEMENTARY GO SERIES VOL 1

You feel quite strong for a 18k to me , i wont be surprised if you improve a few stones just by playing a lot :-)

Hope this has helped.

P.S. If you want to find me on KGS i'm AcidBurn , will help if i'm on at the time.]
