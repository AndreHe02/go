AB[pd][dp]C[Dan:
I was White.

I've played so many more games as Black than as White now, that I think I've grown accustomed to playing slow-and-steady moves.  So I'm losing a lot of my games as White now.

So I'm really looking for suggestions on where I should be playing faster moves.

Tim:

(Note, I fear that some of my comments may be rather brutal. I should probably go through and tone them down a bit, but I don't have the time. Please take them with a pinch of salt. Most of the time you play reasonably well, but the purpose of this review is to focus on the things that you are doing wrong.)

I am not convinced that what you need is faster moves. Here is another view on how to play handicap games which is worth considering:

White can win handicap games by defending efficiently. In a handicap game, if black ever gets a chance to seriously attack white, in particular to "make territory whilst attacking" then white is finished. Of course white does not always have time to play defensive moves and so if you can see that you must take sente to play elsewhere then you must play lightly. If you play lightly then when (if) black attacks you you will be able to deal with the situation quite easily. In this way white can move round the board, often in sente, accumulating good shape and thick/strong positions waiting for black inefficient moves to accumulate or waiting for a chance to attack black. Then white can attack without fear of a dangerous counter-attack from black.   The above is not a guaranteed recipe for successes, it is more an interesting view-point which is worth thinking about, if only to reject later.

The other general comment from a quick surf through the game is that your endgame stinks. In a handicap game white should be looking to use his/her superior ability to gain point in the endgame. If anything you loose points in this endgame. I would recommend that you study some "endgame tesuji" problems. For example the second section of "Get Strong at the Endgame", or the relevant chapter of "Endgame" or the relevant chapter of "Basic Techniques of Go". It will give you an idea of the kind of clever moves that lurk in some seemingly ordinary endgame situations. I remember that when I first looked at such problems I found that they really expanded my horizons.

Now for some more detailed comments . . .

(Phrases in quotes are intended to refer to go proverbs.)

So having reviewed the game I would summarise your key mistakes as:

1) Bad shape.

You do tend to end up with bad shape. You can tell that you have got bad shape when you are forced to make an empty triangle. But by then it is too late. You probably had bad shape already. When you find yourself forced to make bad shape it can be instructive to look back over the game record and at the moves in that local area and to try to spot the point at which the bad shape first appeared. With the benefit of hind-sight, can you change some of your previous moves so that you end up with better shape?

2) Don't play 'forcing' moves just because they are sente.

Another bad habit you have it that you play moves that are sente, they force your opponent to respond, but in fact they help your opponent more than they help you. Moves 103 and 107 are particularly bad example of this. The book "Beyond Forcing Moves" covers this point excellently. (It is a book I really like though it is quite hard in general, I like it because it is a professional talking about what a 100% sequence really looks like and clearly enjoying it.) Some of the key idea in the book:

The introduction says something along the lines of: "A forcing moves gives you the right to force your opponent to respond in a certain way. If you are given the opportunity to tell someone what to do then you are unlikely to say 'hit me in the face', but that effectively what is happening when you play a bad forcing move."

The other key idea is that when you have more than one possible forcing move somewhere then don't play any forcing move until you are sure you know which one you want. And since you get to choose when to play the forcing move you can also choose when not to play it. Often it is better not to play the forcing move and just to carry on with the sequence you wanted to play anyway. Since you can go back and play the forcing move whenever you like your opponent has to keep worrying about this possibility.   3) You could get a lot better by playing more precisely.

Quite often you make silly mistakes or miss a relatively obvious tesuji. For example moves 43, 61, 87, etc. I think that by just eliminating these slips and training yourself to make the 'tesuji' move instinctively you could get a lot stronger. This does not require deep of difficult reading. What you need to do is

a) spot the key points  b) quickly and accurately read out the short sequence which shows whether or not the move works.

The way to learn to do this is to do lots of relatively easy tesuji problems. The aim is to do the problems quickly and accurately. I quite seriously suggest that you start with "Graded Go Problems for Beginners, Vol. 2". Of course, an 8k* should be able to do these with no problem. Well it wouldn't do you any harm to find out if you can or not. I fell that a European 1 dan should be able to do all of the problems in all 4 volumes with ease, but I still get stuck on the second half of volume 4. The stuff in these books may be basic, but it is very good stuff and there is a lot of it. Being able to get the easy stuff right instinctively (and the only way to develop instincts is to train them) makes it much easier to concentrate of the hard stuff.

Having said that go is a hobby and if slogging through 300 go problems is not your idea of fun then you are not obliged to do it. But if you want to get better quickly this is what I would recommend.

Once you have the material in GGP2 down pat you can go onto volumes 3 and 4 and also "Get strong at tesuji". Putting all that together is over 1500 problems and that is a lot of knowledge. These books are rather different from the "Tesuji" and "Life and Death" which try to classify and teach the material more. Perhaps one could say that "Tesuji" and "Life and Death" are like text books and GGP etc. are more like revision guides.]
;W[pp];B[cc]
(;W[cn]C[Tim:
I don't feel that this is the right direction. See the variation for an alternative suggestion.]
;B[dn];W[dm];B[en]
(;W[cp]C[Dan:
Good variation to play?

Tim:
I don't know. It is not the most normal move, so perhaps it is up to you to justify why this is a good move in this position.

Let us have a look at some alternative variations to see what comes out best . . .

Well even after looking at the variations it is hard to know what to play. I guess that there is no right move. This move must be playable, but it is nothing special, but then there rarely is in the opening.]
;B[co];W[bo];B[do];W[bm];B[cq];W[bp];B[em];W[el]C[Dan:
How is this?

Tim:
This is a major overplay. White deserves to get cut immediately. You must make the patient, solid extension D8.]

(;B[hq];W[nc]C[Again, if white approaches on the other side white gets a chance to build up a large scale framework on the right side.]
;B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[kc];B[fc]C[This is a rather modest move.

Black should still be cutting white in the centre at D8.

In term of big moves I prefer a black approach at O3, trying to build a moyo across the bottom.]
;W[cf]LB[ch:A]C[Dan:
I think this was a bad extension.  I think it's too far from my wall, and it leaves no followup move.  A was the proper extension, no?

Tim:
Possibly. The honest move is just to connect at D8. Then E8 starts to look like a good turning move. After the re-enforcement at D8 this is about the distance white should be extending. Because of white's weakness this is dangerous.

Dan:
I guess I was confused by the 3-3.  I don't really know how to play against a 3-3.

Tim:
Well the nice thing about the 3-3 point is that there are no complicated joseki to learn. There are only really 2 options for white to approach a black 3-3 point.

1) Wait for white to extend on a large scale then play the shoulder hit at the 4-4 point.

2) Approach from one side forcing black to extend on the other.

The other option is that black adds a second stone here first, as in this game. Then an approach on the other side by white is big, it is a lot like an approach to a shimari, but it is not always that big.

But the 3-3 point is like the 4-4 point in that it is not terribly urgent to play another move in the same corner for either player.

The disadvantage of the 3-3 point is that it is difficult to use as the basis for a large framework because it is low and white can strike at the 4-4 point. The disadvantage on the 4-4 point is that it is weak on territory because white can strike at the 3-3 point and steal the corner territory, but the 4-4 point is good for playing large frameworks.

You could try searching Jan van der Steen's web site for a variety of games involving the 3-3 point and just play through them at speed to get a feel for some of the things that happen.

This is all covered quite well in 38 basic joseki.];B[ch]C[This is a good move by black.]

(;W[eg]C[This is dangerous.]
(;B[dg]C[Pushing into a night's move like this is horribly vulgar. This just helps white.]
;W[df];B[eh];W[fg]C[This leaves a glaring defect. Black now has an obvious good move at F15.

This solid connection at E14 is the move. This is totally solid. After this white can jump out with moves like G13 and H14, so it is not, in fact, that much slower. Furthermore white is left with better shape, so there is probably some aji left around D17, which white might be able to exploit later.]
;B[fh];W[gg];B[dl]C[At last!];W[cm];B[ek]C[Another vulgar move. "Don't play 1, 2, 3, just play 3." Black is going to have to play D9 anyway. Playing this atari first just helps white to strengthen himself. If black just plays D9 then white will probably play F8 anyway, after which black will not play E9.]
;W[fl];B[ck];W[gh]C[Good move, but might white be able to play F9 in sente first?]
;B[fk];W[gl];B[gk];W[hl];B[bk]C[Black can, and should, push further in the centre in sente.]
;W[bq]C[This is not the best move.

White would like to cut at D3 and capture all of the corner territory. Failing that the clamp at C2 is almost certainly a better move than this one. Of course these more ambitious moves may not work, you need to read them out. (I think that they both work, but you should work this out for yourself.)]
;B[cr];W[hk]C[Hmm, is black really alive in the corner? I don't think so.]

(;B[fi]C[This seems like a wasted move.];W[hi];B[gi];W[ii]C[Is this really necessary? Does white need to be 100% connected? A move like Q10 instead seems to be better.]
;B[nq]
(;W[kq]C[What are you aiming to do with this move?

White does not need to worry about black getting a large territory at the bottom because of the white thickness in the centre. If will be easy for white to invade or reduce later. White can afford to build up on the right side for now.]
;B[jp]C[Odd.];W[kp]C[This is probably good enough for white. This exchange of the lat two move seems to do more for white than for black.]
;B[no];W[pn];B[pr];W[qq];B[qr];W[rr]C[Why are you answering? "The second line is the line of defeat. Leave such moves for your opponent and play in important pont.

(of course this is quite a big move, and does reduce black's eye space, but is it really the biggest thing on the board.)]
;B[lr];W[ko]C[The hane at K5 must be better.];B[jo]
(;W[kn]C[Still hane, this time "at the head of two stone".]
;B[rm];W[pl]C[Dan:
How is this?  I had no idea how to respond to S7.

Tim:
Well if you opponent insists on playing on the second line then you probably don't have to worry very much. In some positions you would like to pincer, but probably not here. Your move is good because it aims to continue the attack on the weak black group.

The problem for white in the position is where is the white territory? It is starting to look possible to build centre territory.]
;B[qk];W[nm]C[The push at Q9 looks like a big move for either player so why don't you grab it now before shutting black in? After Q9, N6 might be a better move than this one.]
;B[mn];W[mm];B[rp];W[rq];B[qo];W[po];B[qn];W[lm]C[This move is not really necessary. Black cannot squeeze out through this gap anyway, so there is not point in sealing it off. If black tries to break out then black gets some very weak stones cut off in the centre which probably just get captured.

Instead really shut black in with L2. You might even kill black, but when black lives in gote you can then push at Q9 and surround your centre territory which is what you want to do anyway.]
;B[kr];W[jq]C[Good, saving his stones is still going to have to cost black a bit towards the left.]
;B[iq];W[jr];B[lq];W[ho]C[This looks small. The two black stones you are threatening to cut off are not cutting stones.]
;B[hp];W[io];B[ip];W[hc]C[I still feels bigger to me to start with Q9 and go in that direction.

Of course this way you put pressure on the corner, but not much, and since black can peep at F15 he is safe.]
;B[fe];W[ff]C[Two empty triangles with a single move. You must be able to find something better.

How about E15?

Sometime an attachment like G15 or a peep like E16 is a tesuji, but that requires reading.]
;B[ee];W[ef];B[dd]C[This is not a very big move. There are much bigger things like Q9, O15, H15, killing the bottom left corner, etc.]
;W[he]C[Is this the biggest gap in the white central territory? Of course I still like Q9.]
;B[ne];W[md]C[This is the wrong direction, it gains hardly any points for white. Play in the centre.]
;B[pk];W[ok];B[oj];W[nj];B[nk];W[ol];B[ni];W[mj];B[mi];W[oi]
C[This forces a reply, but does it gain you anything? White had 2 possible forcing moves here. It is impossible to say which one you want to play yet, the moves will still be there later, so don't play either until you have to.]
;B[pj];W[li];B[mg];W[mh]C[Again, "don't play 1, 2, 3, just play 3". Just play at M12, and leave black to deal with his weaknesses rather than forcing him to defend them.]
;B[nh];W[lh];B[lg];W[kg];B[kf];W[jg];B[me]C[Now we are well and truly into the endgame so we should count to see what the situation is.

Black:
Right side: 40.
Bottom right: 5.
Top left corner: 10.
Left side: 10.
Bottom: 15.

So about 80.

White:
Centre: 25.
Top: 15.
Bottom left corner: 5 (if it lives)

So about 45.

What is your plan for winning this game? or should you resign?

Whilst counting we notice that the biggest undecided areas are around R18, G2, G18, B14, etc, which is a great when when playing the endgame.]
;W[qb];B[rb];W[jn];B[go];W[hm]C[Why not hane at G6 and aim at black's shortage of liberties?]
;B[ld];W[lc];B[kd];W[jd];B[jf];W[if];B[ig];W[jh]C[Dan:
Bad shape?  Is K11 better?

Tim:
Presumably you worked out the answer to this during the game. It doesn't work (double atari!). There is nothing you can do about the bad shape at this stage. The cause was earlier. If only the N12, O12 exchange hadn't been played and you had one more liberty.]

I prefer playing this way. White should be happy to play a big moyo game because that makes white's 4-4 point look better than black's 3-3 point.

Where is black going to play now? There does not seem to be a good extension on the left hand side. The biggest move seems to be to approach at R6.

The formation across the bottom is, of course, full of holes. In particular black has a good invasion at H3. But if black invades there white can jump into the 3-3 point and give up the stone at F3 in exchange for the corner territory. So white's position is light and flexible. Black has lots of other possible moves in this area too, it is quite easy for black to choose a sub-optimal line. This is exactly the sort of position white would like to see on the board in a handicap game.]
