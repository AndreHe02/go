C[Im white, so my opponent Gyurka starts with black.

Hello ,
my name is Benjamin and I'm 12k in Germany i'll begin all my comments with <dude:> that's my nick on KGS so if you have any questions feel free to ask me by mail or if you meet me on KGS.

after a first short review of your game I have pointed out that your main-mistakes are unecessary tries to secure  where you can play elsewhere
but now enjoy the review];B[pp];W[pd]C[Just playing stars first, see what territory I can get]
;B[dd];W[dp]C[Same here, I was wondering as to what purpose it serves placing initial cornerstone on 4C or 3D instead of 4D

dude: the stones on 4c  or  3d are saving the corner while 4d makes influence to the center]
;B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[Feel like defending a bit down there so used that stone, would an attack from the other side be better?

dude: this stone is ok but you can also peep with H3 (see var)]
;B[fp];W[ep]LB[cl:E][dl:F][cm:C][dm:D][cn:B][dn:A]C[I just built the empty triangle, is that bad as a way of connecting as done here?

dude: it isn't necessary to connect at E4 better play one of the marked moves as a corner extension]
;B[kq];W[qj];B[qn];W[pm]LB[qq:B][nr:A]C[Seeing if i can push him down to his corner while gaining some stones towards center

dude: not with this move- perhaps it is possible to invade the corner wit A and B]
;B[qm];W[ql];B[pn];W[ck]C[I wanted to expand my lower left corner here.]
;B[nc]C[And he attacks the same way again];W[ic]LB[kc:A][lc:B]
C[My thought here is to separate his stones really

dude: the stone at J17 is too far from O17 better at a or b]
;B[kc];W[fc]C[Thinking i can come at this corner from both sides]
;B[ec];W[fe]LB[cg:A]C[This was meant as loose connection between the lower and upper stones, but was very short

dude: you're right but it also secures some territory between lines F and J - A would also be possible to continue your attack from two sides and it makes territory on the left]
;B[cf];W[dg]LB[ch:A]C[dude: better at A];B[pb];W[lc]C[going for some bigger territory and capturing stone 19

dude: as you have seen that doesn't work ;-)];B[ld];W[mc];B[md]
;W[nd];B[lb];W[mb]C[I think its here I realise those are dead]
;B[nb];W[kd]C[So now I instead try to get stones above him so that I can get centerterritory instead of the corner, I see the corner as lost at this point

dude: first try to make territory on the outsides there's a proverb that says: "there's no territory in the center"]
;B[ma];W[le];B[me];W[ke]C[Defending 34];B[qc];W[oc]LB[qd:A]
C[Trying to push him far down, should perhaps cover his opening with 37 first..

dude: don't try to attack when your own group isn't secure so better at A]
;B[qd];W[ob];B[oa];W[ne];B[mf];W[nf];B[mg];W[ng]C[He wasnt backing down, and neither was I, thinking I could later cover his wall from the left while I gained a good position on the right side]
;B[mh];W[rd]C[dude: this move doesn't work better play at  R15]
;B[qe];W[pe];B[qf]C[Now my plans for territory on left side looks less realistic..]
;W[pg]C[Hoping to cutt him  off so i can get down to the side here]
;B[pf];W[of]C[Got one eye there now, with two possibilities for connecting

dude: the white corner is eyeless and dead if black plays like the variation]

(;B[nh]C[i guess that was why he didnt back down with his wall... is it normal to push walls like 44-45-46-47-48-49  did down there?

dude: yes i would have played the same];W[oh]C[Two temporary eyes now]
;B[pc]C[Gotta connect..];W[od];B[qg];W[ph]LB[qh:A]C[dude: better connect with A]
;B[qh];W[qi]C[There, at least perhaps i can cut down to the side and close his corner now]
;B[oi];W[pi];B[oj]C[he does however gain good influence towards center..]
;W[ok];B[nj];W[nk];B[mk];W[nl];B[ml];W[om]C[Main objective is making that group solid with two eyes now basically]
;B[on];W[rm]C[Threaten his corner here was my thought];B[rn]
;W[pk]LB[mm:A][nn:B]C[Good connect-possibilities now, and two eyes

dude: the two groups are already connected so better start pushing to the center with A (B is also possible)]
;B[mm];W[de];B[ce];W[ed]C[Are these bad moves of mine, Im practically giving him the corner?]
;B[cc];W[eb];B[dc];W[df]C[Securing my stones a bit];B[cg];W[db]
C[I];B[cb];W[ca]C[dude: keep this stone for the endgame and play B11 or c12]
;B[ba];W[da]C[dude: better connect with F18 / in the way you've played the four stones are dead]
;B[bc];W[ka]C[Seeing if I can find any weaknesses down here

dude: the black group is surely alive so it doesn't make sense to me to keep on attacking here]
;B[fb]C[instead I lost the four stones in upper right, didnt think about securing them, silly]
;W[gb]C[Hoping to miimize my losses, forcing him to take my stones]
;B[ea];W[gc];B[jb]C[I was unable to followup 94, so I consider it lost now]
;W[jc];B[ib];W[hb];B[kb];W[ie]LB[kg:A]C[Trying to somewat secure my wall

dude: again it seems better to run towards the center with A]
;B[kh];W[jh]C[Hes going to get a lot of center too..];B[ji]
;W[ih];B[ii];W[hi];B[jg]C[Having heavy losses up there I try to threaten his space a little with a stone that can escape three ways]
;W[gm];B[ik];W[hk];B[fn];W[em];B[fm];W[fl];B[en];W[dm];B[dn]
;W[cn];B[do];W[co]C[Im hoping to get this corner];B[cq]C[he wants otherwise]
;W[cp];B[bp];W[cr];B[dr];W[er]LB[dq:A]C[dude: if you play at A instead you will get the corner]
;B[br];W[bo];B[ap];W[cs]C[Sort of feeling the corner is lost now..]
;B[ds];W[af]C[Hoping to take some territory from that corner upper left]
;B[ah];W[bh];B[bg];W[ag];B[ai];W[bi];B[aj];W[ak];B[bj];W[cj]
;B[bk];W[bl]C[I dont know why he gave me those

dude: because there was no way out for him (well done !!! I didn't see it when you played A14)]
;B[be];W[ah]C[dude: Not necessary];B[fr];W[ij];B[jj];W[hj];B[ig]
;W[hh];B[il];W[hf];B[hg];W[gg];B[if];W[ge]LB[kg:A]C[I thought this move was needed to protect the three stones 158-160 and the earlier one

dude: A kills the four black stones];B[es];W[hm]C[hoping to use his opening a bit, maybe i should have extended instead of playing it next to G7?]
;B[go];W[kf];B[kg];W[jf];B[in]C[I];W[jn]C[i dont really see me being able to invade here but give it a try]
;B[im];W[hl]C[Didnt work so I sealed up instead];B[hn];W[ch]
;B[ae];W[eh];B[gn];W[an];B[nm];W[sm];B[sn];W[rf]C[That corner also looked un-invadable to me
dude: yes it is, you can't get into this corner];B[rh];W[qa]
;B[rb];W[pa];B[na];W[ia];B[ja];W[ha];B[re];W[ri]C[Just filling up the spaces now]
;B[rl]C[Damn, I forgot to secure that border, I had considered it many times but didnt find it to be urgent...]
;W[rk];B[sl];W[sk];B[qq];W[sh];B[sg];W[si];B[jo];W[dq];B[bq]
;W[ao]LB[fs:A]C[dude: instead kill at A and the corner is yours]
;B[bs];W[lf];B[lg];W[ga];B[fa];W[bf];B[mi];W[ek];B[eo];W[tt]
C[I didnt see anything more to do now so passed, seeing that I had lost big anyway.
I started playing go a coupe weeks back and this is how most my games end.
This is probably a horrible game I bet, so if you feel theres no point in reviewing it then dont :)

Thank you for your time];B[tt];W[tt])
