C[Hello Edgarciens!

The three things I can recommend the most to you when playing are:
1) Balance your moves a little more.
2) Try and connect you stones.
3) When you are in a fight, try and get more liberties for your weaker stones and take away liberties from your opponents stones.]
;B[pd];W[dd];B[pp]LB[cp:A][dp:B]C[No criticism of the move here, but in this situation I often play a move at 'A' or 'B' because I think it leads to an interesting game.  I think it is definitely favorable if you tend to be intimidated by opponents who build large frameworks because it is very hard to build a large framework with the type of opening you get when you play at 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[dp];B[qj]LB[pj:A]C[This move is not necissarily bad, but it is more commonly played at 'A'.  Where you played it, it is a little bit timid.]
;W[nq]
(;B[qn]LB[pj:B][pn:A][kp:D][lq:C]TR[qj]C[This move is too low, and definitely timid.  You the marked stone is already low, playing the stone at 'A' makes better shape.  This move would look better if you had a stone at 'B'.  Also since you have the marked supporting stone I think you should definitely consider the pincer at 'C' or 'D' (See variations.)

This is what I am talking about with balance.  The stones here are too unbalanced, biased too much to a low position.]
;W[pr]LB[fc:B][lq:A]C[I would just ignore this move since you are already fairly concentrated and they pose no threat.  You could play at 'A', or maybe switch to an approach with 'B'.]
;B[qq]LB[pi:A]TR[qj]C[This feels like you are doubling down in the corner and are left with a group of stones that feels overconcentrated.  The lower right corner would work better if the marked stone is farther away, perhaps at 'A'.]
;W[kq]C[After this you have played a joseki, but I would say that white had gotten the better of this exchange because of your low position on the right.  White's low position is okay since White has to worry about living in this situation.]
;B[fc];W[cf];B[db]LB[id:A][jd:B]C[You have so many stones on the right side that I would think about connecting towards them and building more of a framework.  Personally, I would prefer this stone at 'A' or 'B'.]
;W[gc]C[You seemed confused by this move, which is understandable as it's not played much.  One might be inclined to view it as a trick play, but it is actually a modern joseki invented in Korea.  You won't find it in books that are older, so I'd check an online joseki dictionary for newer variations.

On a larger scale this move disconnects your stones from the upper right corner.]

(;B[fd]LB[gd:A]C[This move should be played at 'A'.  It's not a bad move since it firmly separates white's groups, but it is not the best move in this situation.]
;W[fb]
(;B[cc]LB[eb:A]C[This move should have been played at 'A', it is a mistake that lets you get cut appart.]
;W[eb];B[cd];W[de];B[dc]LB[bf:A]C[I wouldn't play this move, as it cuts down on the number of liberties you have and it doesn't connect.  I'd just go straight to 'A'.]
;W[ec];B[cg]LB[bf:A]C[This move is questionable.  I would have prefered it at 'A'.  It's possible for White to capitalize, although he didn't do that best job of it.]

(;W[dg];B[cn]LB[bf:A]C[This is a big mistake as I'm sure you can tell by the follow up.  Your stones in the corner are not yet alive.  This should have been played at 'A'.]
;W[be]C[This move kills your stones.  After this it would be best to not play any more moves here.  If you can come up with a ko somewhere else, this corner will be the source of a LOT of ko threats.]
;B[bb];W[ca];B[da];W[bd];B[ba];W[ab]C[After this move, your stones are dead AND almost all the aji is gone.It would have been better to leave it after the first move.]

(;B[cq]LB[jc:C][jd:D][fp:B][fq:A]TR[cn]C[At this point you are behind after losing the upper left hand corner completely.  I would go with something a little more agressive like 'A' or 'B'.  The problem with the move that you played is that it gives White a lot of influence and make it even harder for you to make up territory around the board.  Alternitively, the approach stone is in no immediate danger, I would think about 'C' or 'D' to keep from falling behind in the whole board situation.

Also, the marked stone is key in keeping White's territory in the upper left in check.  By playing this move, and the follow up, you let it get cut and isolated.]
;W[cp];B[dq];W[ep]
(;B[fq]LB[bp:A]C[This move is a mistake.  You need to play 'A' first.]
;W[bq]
(;B[eq]LB[gq:A]C[I don't like this move.  You need to get more out in the open.  'A' would be better.  White won't be able to cut if you play at 'A'.]
;W[br];B[fp];W[dn];B[en]C[I'm not really sure what you are trying to accomplish with this move, but it is better left unplayed.  All it does is serve to allow White to reinforce himself.]
;W[dm]CR[ah][bh][ch][ai][bi][ci][aj][bj][cj][ak][bk][ck][al]
[bl][cl][am][bm][cm][an][bn][ao][bo][co][ap][bp]C[White's left side after this is enourmous.]
;B[iq];W[nc]
(;B[nd]LB[lc:A]C[I'm not a fan of this move.  It let's white get to strong on the top side.  I think 'A' would be better.  This move just lets white solidify territory on the upper side.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[oc];B[pc];W[me];B[pf];W[nf];B[mc]LB[mf:A][ng:B]
C[This is the wrong cutting point.  You should cut at 'A', which threatens to capture with 'B'.  The cutting point you played won't work.]
;W[lc];B[mb];W[lb];B[mf]C[This cut is now too late.  You can't threaten the bottom stones any more because they are already safe.]
;W[of]
(;B[pe]LB[oe:A]C[Consider 'A' instead.  The shape is not the best, but it does have the advantage of reducing the number of liberties the white stones have.]
;W[oh];B[lf];W[ke];B[mh];W[oj]
(;B[ph]TR[lf][mf][mh]C[This is from the wrong side.  All of your stones on the left side can't be killed.  You need to reinforce the marked stones in the center.]
;W[nh];B[pi]LB[mi:A]C[This should probably be played at 'A', your stones in the center are in real trouble.]
;W[mi];B[jj]C[I'm not sure what you are trying to accomplish with this move.  It abandons your stones in the center and doesn't really accomplish anything.]

(;B[bn]C[The thing to keep in mind about this move is that it gets you extra liberties while attacking.  That is what you need in a fight, to get liberties faster than your opponent in close quarters like this.]
