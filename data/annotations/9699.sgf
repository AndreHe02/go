C[Hello! 
My name is JT, and I'm excited to review this game. My rating is currently 7kyu, and, if I'm reading your moves right, our styles are fairly similar, so I hope my advice will be useful to you.

The game gets a bit hectic in the fight at the end; you've asked me to focus specifically on that, so I'll do what I can. But, the story of this game is much earlier on. You went into that final fight significantly behind, and then made a massive comeback that, as I'll explain later, probably shouldn't have worked. 

So, I'll examine the early play, starting with the Joseki, and try to explain how the game came to be a massive, complex brawl over the entire central moyo, which you had to win to have a chance. Then I'll do my best to discuss how to kill in such fights, and white should have done to deny you points.

Here we go!];B[dd];W[dp];B[pp]C[I have no understanding of the difference between this and]

(;W[nq];B[pd]C[Your move here strikes me as very strong. Getting the first move into a corner is extremely urgent. Responding to the bottom right would have been passive and weak.]
;W[nc]
(;B[nd]TR[ic][jc][id][jd]SQ[lc][qf]C[I'll try to avoid suggesting tons of new Joseki to memorize, but since you use this one twice, I think it's fair to suggest two new ones. 

This move allows W to build a nice, strong group on the top at little cost, and doesn't get you terribly much territory. It can be good if B has a stone in the triangle-marked region, but is bad in an empty corner.

Consider in stead the more passive play, at R14, or the tight pincer, at M17. Either of these will leave you with more secure territory

http://eidogo.com is an excellent interactive joseki library for checking out simple variations on these joseki. See variations for the starts I think are most important to review. (this link is also in the email I sent you)]
;W[md];B[ne];W[mc];B[oc];W[id];B[gc]SQ[qf][qg][qh]C[This is an error. The Joseki you played in the top right requires a stone in the R column, probably R13, to have any real strength.]
;W[hc];B[gd];W[cf]
(;B[ce]C[This move gives far too much credibility to the very weak stone at C14. See variations.]
;W[df]
(;B[np]C[Same joseki, same comments as before. See the passive variation here in particular.]
;W[mp];B[no];W[mr];B[oq];W[or];B[pr];W[qk];B[qi];W[ro]C[The last few moves here are why you needed to fill in under these joseki. He takes tons of territory away from you over the next moves.]

;B[po];W[pn];B[om];W[sn];B[qo];W[sp];B[sl]C[The white group here is alive, as you discover.]
;W[iq];B[sm];W[rn];B[sr];W[sq];B[ol];W[qg];B[oi]SQ[qf]C[This should be here. Your corner is very important.]
;W[rd];B[qf]C[Too late.];W[rf];B[qe];W[re];B[pg];W[qb];B[rg]
;W[qc];B[sc];W[ob];B[pc];W[pb];B[me];W[ke]SQ[mf][nj][mn]C[So, at this point, what you have, I believe inadvertently, done, is traded away two of your corners for all of the squares as your influenced area. White is starting to go about reducing that quite correctly. 

Henceforth we will not discuss the loss of your corner territory and will focus on the fight over the territory in the middle - if not the fight for survival of white's group there.]
;B[dk]C[Good thought.];W[ci];B[co];W[bk];B[cl];W[bl];B[cp];W[dq]
;B[bm];W[gp]C[You give up a ton of points in the corner here. Don't underestimate how many points you can grab by getting key corner moves in first. I think playing C2 here is worth something like fifteen points. If you want, try playing out the two variations and counting.]

(;B[fn]
(;W[lq]SQ[kg][fh][hn][ln]C[This move is puzzling to me. If white plays at one of the marked squares, he denies huge amounts of center points to you.]
;B[mo]C[Absolutely correct from you.];W[lo];B[ln];W[ko];B[kf]

(;W[jf];B[le];W[ld];B[je];W[kd];B[jg];W[if];B[kg]C[White has misplayed hugely again, giving you way too much central influence. See variation.]
;W[kn];B[km]
(;W[kj]C[Very greedy from white. He doesn't need to go here, he can just... ( see variation )]
;B[jm];W[ij];B[hh]C[Since white is trying to live inside, you must try to kill him. This is correct play from you. Really, though, white should be making runs to the middle from the outside (variations)]

;W[im];B[in];W[jl];B[kl];W[jk];B[hk];W[fj];B[ei]C[This is all very strange, but white looks very alive to me here. I'll try to pinpoint where he throws it away.]

C[White has correctly recognized that he is alive and is reducing your territory. He is very ahead here. In the variation I show score est that white is alove and get game score.]

;W[cr];B[br];W[dr];B[gb];W[hb]C[Nice way to firm up territory in sente.]
;B[ha];W[ia];B[ga];W[jb];B[be];W[qd];B[qh];W[ml];B[bg]C[(this note is from the future) 
I believe this is the move that killed the white group. Good job spotting it; I didn't.]
;W[bh];B[bf]SQ[bs]C[Slow. If you think there's any chance the center group might die, take this chance to prove it. Otherwise, go for the much bigger B1.]
;W[dh];B[cg];W[eh];B[fh];W[ef];B[gf];W[ff];B[ge]C[I didn't notice the white group on the left die on the first time through. I think it's already gone at this point. I'm going to go back and see if I can find it.]

(;W[ki];B[ji];W[lh];B[mi];W[kh];B[jh];W[hi];B[bq]C[This has been a most entertaining game to review; thank you for sending it in.

To summarize:
Good job not getting pushed around in the super early game. You'll get a lot by learning a few mainline variations of the two responses I highlight to the knight's-move approach to the 4-4 stone.

In the joseki you do play, always always always play on the opposite side of where your opponent approached when everything seems to settle down. Your corner is not settled until you do and white takes tons of points away from you.

White made several large misplays going into the central moyo. You reacted to them well, but don't count on earning large amounts of points like that in the future.

Good luck getting back into the game!

I'm going to poke around with white scrambling for survival with weird corner tricks. Probably he's completely dead and nothing comes of it. We'll find out.
