C[steev [8k\]: hi

My primary advice after looking at the game would be to study life-and-death.  You had opportunities to kill very large B groups, both of which you first didn't notice, and then when you did attack, you did not get the best result.]
;B[pd]C[tibul [8k\]: hi, have a good game];W[dp];B[pq];W[cd]
;B[qk]C[B is playing "low Chines" opening, if you care to look it up]
;W[qf]LB[nc:B][jp:A]C[A or B are the more usual approaches]
;B[qe]
(;W[qi];B[pf];W[rf]TR[qg]C[This is a mistake. Note the marked weakness remains for quite a while.]

(;B[mc];W[rj]C[Shoulder hit from below is almost never good early on.
Usually better to try for center access.];B[rk]C[Seems bad for me here]

Even if it turns out you can't kill the marked stones (though they certainly look dead) you'll have a nice wall to extend from, and B will have very few points.]
