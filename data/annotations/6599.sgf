C[k0n1g [14k\]: hi gg

[J\] Hi, my name is Jamie, I'll be reviewing your (White's) game. I'll precede my comments with [J\]. The usual provisos apply (someone stronger would know more).]
;B[qd]C[BigHomie [13k\]: hello. ggg];W[cd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc]
TR[qj]C[[J\] This makes the marked point big.];W[fc]TR[cj]C[[J\] Likewise.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[kq]C[[J\] Black shouldn't really be all low along the bottom like this. Creates some obvious points for invasion later (or maybe even now)]

(;W[eq]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I got greedy here. I think I was supposed to play at C3 if in this corner at all.]
;B[cj]LB[cf:A][cl:B]TR[ci]C[[J\] I prefer C11 for a black invasion here, makes A and B miai.]
;W[ch]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I liked this move even though it didn't kill the stone, it made him small and I expanded on the left

[J\] Yes, this is a big point for you.]
(;B[cm]C[[J\] Black should not contact here.];W[dm];B[cl]
(;W[dl]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Was there a way to prevent B from getting out?

[J\] Not really, and this sequence is not good for you. see comment at move 21.]
;B[dk];W[ek];B[ej];W[fk];B[fj]LB[fg:A]TR[cj][ej][dk]C[[J\] Black has now (thanks to white) a nice wall pointing at what should have been a good white moyo.]
;W[di]C[BigHomie [13k\]: how about F12 instead? It does leave some holes though.]
;B[dj]
(;W[kc];B[me]TR[qk]C[[J\] R9 would be huge for B at the moment, and make it very hard for you to invade the right hand side.]
;W[qo]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This attack seems kinda late, looking back. I might have gotten more territory at R9 as well.

[J\] Just in time, though blacks play at N15 helps in this regard.]
;B[qm]
(;W[qq]C[[J\] Playing here is inviting B to close you in, allowing B at least the chance at a huge area in the top half of the right hand side. See var.]
;B[qr]
(;W[rq];B[pp]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I don't know the joseki here, if there is one.]
;W[rn];B[on]C[BigHomie [13k\]: this move let me put pressure on him later. I think that Q6 would've been safer.

[J\] Your position this way is very low, B should be happy.]
;W[rm];B[rl];W[rr];B[pr];W[po];B[oo]TR[on][pp][pq][pr]C[[J\] A wall essentially lacking defects. Q5 was a "thank you" move, which you should avoid.]
;W[ql];B[pl];W[qk];B[qh];W[pm];B[om]
(;W[qn]C[[J\] not good, give your group solid life instead.]
;B[pn]
(;W[qi]C[[J\] If you ever want to attack the R12 stone (and you might) do not contact it like this, you only make it stronger.]
;B[pi];W[ri];B[rh];W[pj];B[oj];W[ph];B[oi];W[pg]
(;B[qg]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was a really complicated fight.]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[sh];B[rg];W[pk];B[ol];W[ok];B[nk];W[nh];B[qm]
C[BigHomie [13k\]: P14 would've been better, I think.]
(;W[qe]C[[J\] Ouch, this just allows black to make a small ko into a big ko, expensive!]
;B[rk];W[pm];B[cc]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I guess I should have answered this attack. He did end up getting this corner in the end.

[J\] Now you pay the price for the ko, here or somewhere else. Too late at this point to avoid loss.]
;W[re];B[qm];W[qj];B[rj];W[pm];B[dc]C[BigHomie [13k\]: It was a good ko threat, but I would've lost my whole right side if I had responded.]
;W[sf];B[qm];W[sg];B[qp];W[rp];B[bd]C[[J\] Should be a won game for black at this point, the ko fight, and loss of this whole corner for white, has really turned the game.]
;W[ce];B[be];W[bf];B[eb];W[ed]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was a weird move. I was wondering what to play here. I think that G16 might have been smarter.

[J\] Not many good choices for white at the moment, just have to see what comes your way.]
;B[fb]
(;W[gb]C[[J\] Hang back a little.];B[dd];W[de]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Now I have cuts all over the place.]
;B[ec];W[gd];B[ee];W[ef];B[fd];W[gc];B[ff]C[BigHomie [13k\]: If I had played it back a bit, I might have been able to prevent him getting out.

[J\] Yes, but much earlier, as noted.];W[gf];B[df];W[cf];B[eg]
;W[fi]C[BigHomie [13k\]: E11 instead.];B[ei]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I was fighting too hard to keep him out of the middle.]
;W[eh]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Lame move. Maybe G12 instead.];B[fh]
;W[gi];B[dh];W[gh];B[gj];W[ji]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I think this move saved me the game. If he had gotten to this area first, I'd have lost.

[J\] you were lucky to win from here, a testament to your perserverance and good luck.]
;B[mj];W[lh];B[lb];W[rd];B[rc];W[qc];B[qb];W[pd];B[pc];W[nd]
TR[me]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This jump left a bunch of holes. It pressured him, but I could've found a better move.

[J\] This move is OK - better than OK - actually this play won you the game, because it cut off the marked stone and turned a large area into white territory. The fact that you lost a big part of it, then got it back, is part of the fun of go.]
;B[md];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[lc];W[mb];B[od]
(;W[ob]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Maybe P15 would have been better.

[J\] No, P15 doesn't work.];B[pe];W[oe];B[qd];W[ne];B[nf];W[of]
;B[mg]C[[J\] An excellent result for white.];W[mh];B[lf];W[kd]
TR[lb][lc][md][me][lf][nf][mg]C[[J\] Good, the aim now must be to keep the black stones from living.]
;B[ld]
(;W[kf]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I don't like this move, but I don't know where I should have played instead.

[J\] I agree, not a good move. Opens too many weaknesses in your position.]
;B[kg];W[lg];B[ke];W[ng];B[jf];W[id];B[jd];W[jc];B[je]
(;W[ih]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Was this move necessary?

[J\] Something was definitely required, at very least you should be looking to connect your G17 stones out while retaining the chance to kill black if it arises.]
;B[ie];W[hd];B[kb];W[jb];B[pb];W[na];B[hf];W[ge];B[ig]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This move by B seems small.]
;W[hg];B[he];W[mf];B[jh];W[ii];B[kh]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Then again, B now has 2 eyes.

[J\] Yes, B should have died.];W[ki];B[hk];W[jk];B[ll];W[jl]
;B[hm];W[fo];B[hp];W[ho]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was a wasted move.

[J\] You could not have later cut at G4 without this move, so not entirely wasted.]
;B[io];W[fm];B[go];W[gp];B[hn];W[gq];B[hq];W[fr]C[BigHomie [13k\]: G2 is bigger, I think.]
;B[gr];W[fp];B[hr]C[[J\] You have actually come out quite well in this corner.]
;W[jn];B[jo];W[ln]C[[J\] Doesn't work with all the black stones nearby.]

(;B[mn];W[lo];B[lp];W[bi]C[BigHomie [13k\]: A bad attempt to try to save this group. It just doesn't have enough room.]
;B[ci];W[bg];B[bj];W[af];B[ai];W[ah]
(;B[bc]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Why did B play this move now?

[J\] Indeed???]
(;W[bm];B[bl]

;W[fl];B[dn];W[em];B[co]

;B[eo];W[ep]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Should have been A5];B[ao];W[ap]
;B[an];W[ka]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was actually a silly attempt to trick B into making the mistake that he actually made later when he lost this group.]
;B[la];W[ja];B[sc]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Could I have taken this corner group? I don't think so at this stage of the game.

[J\] No, it was safe for black.];W[sd];B[pa];W[oa]
(;B[mo];W[lm];B[mm];W[kl];B[ko];W[hl];B[il];W[gl];B[im]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This move was smart. It sets up B to take my three stone group. I should have realized it at this stage.]

(;W[ik]C[BigHomie [13k\]: L7!];B[km];W[jm];B[kn];W[hj];B[gk]
;W[lj];B[lk];W[kk];B[oh];W[ni];B[nj];W[mi];B[nl]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Why did B play this move? I don't think I could cut here.

[J\] I agree.];W[ga];B[ma]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This move is why I won by 20.5 instead of about 3.5

[J\] Lucky lucky lucky.];W[le]C[k0n1g [14k\]: oops
BigHomie [13k\]: sorry...];B[kf];W[fe];B[ed];W[gg];B[fg];W[fa]
;B[ea];W[bb]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Wasted move.]
(;B[bh]C[BigHomie [13k\]: A10 would have finished this "dead" group.]
;W[gn]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was a half-hearted ko threat because I thought the group was already dead.]
;B[ho];W[bi]
(;B[fs];W[es];B[bh];W[rb];B[ra];W[bi];B[ds]C[BigHomie [13k\]: I chose to ignore D1 because I realized that I could still make my group on the top left live if I won the ko fight.]
;W[aj];B[ak]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Why didn't he take E2? That's why he played the threat.]
;W[ai];B[cg]C[BigHomie [13k\]: This was a smart play, but I valued this group more than he appeared to.]
;W[dg];B[qh]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Not bad, but why not go into my gaping bottom left corner?
BigHomie [13k\]: I didn't even have two eyes there!

[J\] Utterly pointless, not a ko threat in any way shape or form.]

(;W[ef];B[rh];W[si];B[df];W[cg];B[ef]C[BigHomie [13k\]: Again, I think he should have taken the bottom left. I practically gave him a free pass.]
