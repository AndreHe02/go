C[Hi.  I made some bad strategic judgements in the beginning, and ended up in a situation which I could not read anymore.

Please give some hints as to why my middle game was wrong...

Please review for white.

Hi,
I tried to indicate some places where you could have played better. Move 78, not connecting, was the losing move. In general I think you should be a little more agressive and keep an eye on the wholeboard situation. 
Hope this is useful,
Frank];B[pd]C[Ecyrd [5k?\]: hi];W[dp]C[katoju [5k?\]: hello]
;B[pq];W[ce];B[fq];W[cn];B[ip];W[qn];B[po]C[This was surprising... But I thing W got a good result out of it.

F: You can see this more often in recent pro-games.  I'm not sure about the continuations myself. One of them starts with white S2. If you want to know more, you should have a look at e.g. gobase.org, where you can look up fuseki of  pro-games.]
;W[qo]C[F: This is not good, giving black the key point R4]
;B[qp]
(;W[qk]C[F: I think this is not so good.See variation.];B[pn]
C[F: Black gets the keypoint now]
(;W[qm]C[I didn't want to hane, because that would give B the P7 stone in sente
F: See variation]
(;B[jd];W[qf];B[nc];W[rd];B[rc]C[F: This is not the standard answer. Black is rather greedy here,  so you should wonder how you can punish him for this.]

(;W[ph]C[F: This way, black gets his way];B[re];W[rf];B[qd]
;W[dc]C[I was happy with sente at this point
F: But black got an extra big corner :-)];B[dj];W[gc]C[I don't know whether something like J6 would've been more urgent.
F: This is big (one more to the right would even be better), but the lower side is more urgent indeed.]
;B[fo];W[ch]MA[dj]C[F: This is not so big as it seems.  The marked stone reduces the potential of the white left side. The lower side or the lower left corner are bigger.]
;B[em]C[F: Very good. Connecting with D10, while making his own moyo bigger.]

(;W[ln]C[Is this a proper place for invasion?
F: Hard to say. This seems reasonable. You should ask yourself the question. What will happen if black tries to surround my invasion stone. Try some variations. A few examples in the variations]
;B[lp]C[F: Black answers defensively, so your last move was good :-)]

(;W[lk]C[F: Good, being flexible. Another possibility in the variation]
;B[pj]
(;W[qj]C[F: This is too submissive I think, you're strong on the right side. See variation]
;B[pi];W[qi];B[ol];W[oh];B[mj]C[F: Your center stones are cut of now.]
;W[nk]C[F: Getting complicated. Connecting with the right side is no option any more, so I think it's better to flee with your stones in the center]
;B[mk];W[nl]C[F: The stone O9 is not important, beter N8 to make some shape]
;B[ml];W[nn]C[F: N7 is still better];B[mm];W[nm];B[mn];W[no]
;B[nq];W[op];B[pp];W[nj];B[oq];W[dq]C[I figured there is enough aji in the center stones to reduce the area significantly, so I decided to secure the corner.

F: You probably have to take this corner to stay in the game, but in M6 and M9 is not much aji anymore.]
;B[eh];W[ki];B[mh];W[mo]C[I think this was a mistake.  In retrospect, I should've saved until I know whether I want to do M5-N5-L4 and get some shape...
F: Don't think so. Cutting here might give you a counter attack on the black pillar. If black connects with the lower side, your center stones will be even weaker.]
;B[lo];W[kg];B[lh];W[ii]C[F: Good];B[ig]
(;W[jg]C[F: Difficult to say, but I think it's better to run further and try to make two eyes. See variation for a possibility]

;B[ki]C[Now the fight got too complicated for me :(.

What would've been the right way to get out of it?

F: The right way would have been to connect a few moves earlier. Now you have two weak groups to look after]

If we try to estimate the score now:
White:
Upper left corner: 25
Lower left corner 15
Right: 14
Komi:  6,5
= 60

Black:
Upper right; 25
Under: 35
Center: 15
= 75

So you're behind, but there are some possibilities left to counter attack (e.g. around M17, E8, cutting at Q7 gives you another 11 points).]
