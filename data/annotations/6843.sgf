RE[W+R]

C[First of all, I am a Go lover in Hong Kong. And I would like to thank you for review my game.

And I will review every games I played by myself. This game I think I played terribly. I missed most of the important points.

However, in this game I found that I don't have solution with one particular form! Therefore, I send this to GTL for help.

Thank you very much.

>>> I hope my comments help. I am a 5 kyu player from Germany.]
;B[pp];W[dd];B[qd];W[dp];B[oc];W[qj];B[fc]C[I usually start attack right away and invade the corner. However, the follow moves I don't have any solution.

>>> Are you black? This move is much better than the immediate invasion on the 3-3-point. The 3-3-point invasion takes a relatively small corner and gives lots of outside strength to the opponent. In the beginning this is not a good deal. Later on it might be.]
;W[db]C[>>> White 8 is unusual. C14 or D14 is more common (and probably better)]
;B[jd]C[>>>I would have played J16. The distance is too large and therefore the pair of black stone has a vulnerable gap.]
;W[gc]C[I don't know how to response to this G17.

>>>> so you are black. G16 (as you played) is probably the best.]

(;B[gd]C[Personally, I think I respond wrongly, I should play C17 to invade corner instead.

Could you please give me some possible response to this?

>>> this move is fine.]
(;W[hc]C[>>> W12 looks wrong.]
(;B[ed]LB[cc:B][gf:A]C[I think this should play at F16, so I may have A or B to attack.

Am I right? Or I have other better play?

>>> B is a suitable attacking point only after you made an approach move at C14. A is not an attack. B13 is good as it protects against W E17.]
;W[ec]C[For this, I regreted that I played E16, I missed that chance to attack the corner. And those three stones were in danger.


>>> I think black is doing fine];B[fb]C[I just have problem deciding playing this move or going outward.

However, I played this move. What I think now is not very efficient!

Does it has any other move?

>>>> there is no other move. F18 is a must. If you go outside white will connect.]
;W[hd];B[ge];W[ee];B[fd];W[he];B[gf];W[jb]C[Now Black(9) is in danger!

How can I prevent this?

How can I reduce the harmful effect for this?

(;B[cn]C[>>>> black must not leave his group F16 so weak!];W[bp]

>>> your answer is fine.]
(;B[dm];W[cl];B[dl];W[bn];B[dn];W[co];B[bk];W[al]C[>>>> I think this is reasonable play from black. You should think about ..... (see variation)]

(;B[dj];W[ek]C[Am I play wrong? Should I play D9 directly?

>>>> It looks like D9 is forced. However it is not. You can punish White for this move....]

;W[gg];B[fg];W[ig];B[gh];W[jf]

;W[nd];B[nc];W[od];B[pd];W[md];B[mc];W[pe];B[oe]C[>>>> right]

;W[pf];B[rf];W[re];B[rg];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[qb];W[rb]C[I think following was wrong direction. I should play Q13, but I think that also not very efficient.]
