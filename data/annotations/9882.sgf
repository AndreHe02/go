C[M: Hi there ! Thank you for reviewing my game!

ZW: Hi musogo! My name is ZeroWave and I'm a shodan from Israel. I'll comment your game and focus on the big and crucial mistakes and common mistakes at DDK level. Feel free to contact me at grmdra12@gmail.com if anything is unclear!]
;B[qd];W[dd];B[pq];W[dq];B[do];W[dk];B[fq]LB[cq:A][gq:B]C[M: Didn't think much about it, just thought "pincer shoud do it"

ZW: this is fine as an idea - but B is better as a pincer :) attach at A is also fine. Your move gives white and ideal followup :(]
;W[ep]C[M: And here I Thought: dammit...two weak stones...not good! lets start by securing the one with more potential

ZW: this is what happens with a pincer on the corner. you can't be afraid of losing all your stones - probably one stone will be better off than the other, and that's ok. Even so, the pincer you chose wasn't really a joseki - and that is what started all the problems.]

(;B[fp]LB[cq:A][iq:B]C[ZW: here we see the problem with this pincer... pushing feels natural, but you're hurting your other stone.  probably either ataching at A or jumping at B is better (see variations).]
;W[eo];B[jq];W[mq];B[ko]LB[qo:A]TR[fp][fq][jq]C[M: The idea was expand toward the center while attack N3

ZW: The center is small right now - this is not a bad move, but for diffrent reasons - it strengthens the triangle group while applying pressure on the white stone. Playing at A is also possible - white doesn't have a two space extension to play, and thus no base - he just created a weak group for himself :)]
;W[no];B[po]LB[qo:A]C[ZW: Good. R5 is also possible.];W[om]
;B[qm];W[pk]
(;B[nq]LB[fc:C][od:B][on:A][cq:D]C[ZW: Don't attach to weak stones! you'll just strengthen them. there are many possible moves here - I added some variations.]
;W[np];B[oc]C[ZW: Good feeling - sadly after a bad exchange at the bottom, but no worries :)]
;W[qf]
(;B[rf]LB[fc:A][qi:B]TR[rd][sd][re][se]C[M: Yeah, guess there are better options, I really didn't think much about it

ZW: Not a good move at all :( Look at the points you're building, when there are big points as A open on the boars. You can also pincer quite nicely here at B.]
;W[qg];B[rk];W[fo];B[go];W[hr];B[fr];W[jr]C[M: I did not want to tsuke at L2 right away because K3 looked weak, so I intendet to secure the right side somehow]

(;B[lq]C[ZW: Interesting Idea! The tsuke is probably still better here because the triangle stone is weak, but great original thinking. It'll help you in the future :)]
;W[nr];B[lr]LB[kr:A]C[ZW: Here A is better. Remove the aji - it's worth more than the 2 points you're making here.]
;W[lp];B[kp];W[ho]LB[hp:A]C[ZW: Probably playing at A is honte. W deserves thye center here, because of thepincer chosen by black.]
;B[gn];W[hp];B[iq]C[ZW: See variation.]
(;W[hq]C[ZW: Lucky...];B[gp];W[kr];B[ir];W[is]
(;B[ls]C[ZW Just connecting is better. See variation.];W[js]
;B[kq];W[hn]C[ZW: now white got the first move :(];B[hm]LB[gm:A]
C[M: I was afraid he would cut at G7

ZW: This move is quite complex indeed. If you want, you can check the variations I included - but it really shouldn't be your focus. I'm not sure whether simply extending at A would be better.]

(;W[in];B[fm];W[dn];B[lo]C[ZW: Too small!]
(;W[mp];B[km];W[im]C[M: I really did not like the way the game developed, now I have to take care of two big groups....  :(     while W is creating a nice big Moyo on the left

ZW: I agree - good assesment.];B[hl];W[il];B[hk];W[ik];B[mm]
;W[pn];B[qn]
(;W[pm]C[ZW: Lucky...];B[lk];W[ii];B[hj];W[ij];B[dm]LB[gh:A]
C[M: Have to start to make some live

ZW: Probably better to keep jumping actually - A is a good move.]
;W[cm];B[dl]
(;W[cn]C[ZW: Lucky again];B[ek];W[dj];B[cl];W[ej];B[fk];W[en]

(;B[em];W[er];B[bl];W[bm];B[cf]C[M: have to get inside...

ZW: A bold move, but B has to do something to make a comeback, so it's a good place to start.]

(;B[fh]C[ZW: Painfull, but maybe still salvagable];W[eg];B[ef]
;W[fg];B[fe]C[ZW: An interesting move. Seems ok though];W[fc]

(;B[ge];W[gg]LB[fh:A]C[M: running again....  :(

ZW: All because of the A move :( The attack was ok, but you missed the chance to seal in]

(;B[hd];W[hb]
(;B[if]C[ZW: This move misses the followup black has here; he can keep white seperated here. See variation.]
;W[ig]
(;B[nk]LB[oq:A][mr:B]C[ZW: Better to play the A-B exchange right now.]
;W[pi];B[ql];W[ok];B[nj];W[oi]LB[oq:A]C[ZW: This should be at A.]

(;B[rn]C[M: Don't know why I did that, guess I just did react without thinking, happends a lot to me

;W[cj];B[di];W[ff];B[si]C[I was lucky at the end, but not happy with my game, I felt like running al the time and struggeling for survival.
Thank you very much for your comments!

ZW: Overall it seems your game was fine; you just missed a few key points (which happens a lot at DDK/ low SDK level) and the position was reversed. I highly recommend playing a few slow games; also, try not holding the mouse before you decide on a move - it helps your thinking process. Finally, try solving Life & Death - it helps getting out of the low levels quickly.
