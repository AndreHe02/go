 toshiV 14k : Hi!
 rfmvadd 17k?: 284 hi

Elom: I'm Elom, KGS 7kyu, and would mark my comments with Elom:]
;W[pp];B[qn];W[on]LB[qk:E][ql:B][pn:D][np:C][mq:F][nq:A]C[Elom: This move is not very common-- it feels quite soft on black, because it's tricky to use this stone now while black gets territory. The other possible moves your opponent could have made are lettered here.]
;B[qk]C[Elom: Seems you chose the nikken tobi. This is good in relation with the star point stone.]
;W[jp]TR[pp]SQ[on]C[Elom: Now the relation with the marked stones is questionable, so p6 might be a bad move.]

(;B[hp]LB[fc:B][jc:G][nc:A][cf:C][cj:F][cn:D][rp:3][fq:E][gq:1]
[iq:2]C[Elom: Hmm, you're first questionable move. It leaves a weakness at F4, but thats not the reason why it's quite "if-y"  I'd personally would play a  1-2 sequence and take the big point at  3, and although A to F are poosible moves, I wouldn't want white to take E.]

(;W[jj]LB[fc:A][jc:D][nc:C][cf:B][cj:E][rp:F]C[Usually I'm ignoring tengen. Is it useful for W to play it now?

Elom: I believe the timing is improper. I have to say, this move seems to have no purpose, or at least it's not very effective. It's not reducing moyo, so white must be trying to indirectly help his lower stones while "throwing a seed" into the center, but since there are many other big points, I wouldn't play here. There are many other moves like A to E]
;B[dj];W[fc];B[cf];W[cm]C[Elom: Interesting, not sure if it's best though.]

(;B[co]C[E7 is better?

Elom: Hmm, it's hard to find a better move than this--];W[ck]
LB[bj:B][cj:A]C[Elom: I would attach at A or slide at B. "attach your weak stones to your opponents strong ones" and "play lightly in your opponents influence". This move feels cramped.]
;B[cj]
(;W[em]LB[fl:A]C[Elom: A is possible,];B[ek]LB[fj:A][fq:B]C[A]

(;W[dk]C[Ouch! Goes beyond allowing the opponent to hane at the head of two stones,  this is like trying to deliberately make your opponent "hane at the head of two stones" in reverse.]
;B[fk]C[Good response.];W[el]
(;B[fn]C[Elom: Nice move, although it there might be a little aji.]

(;W[dn]LB[bn:A]C[Elom: I might choose to fight and "amp up the antics", but it's hard to find a better move than A.]
;B[eo]C[Played E5 and F6 to secure the corner.];W[gl]LB[bn:A]
C[Elom: Should be at A, white can be cut.]
(;B[in]C[Elom: Hmm--];W[gm]C[White didn't have  to sacrifice much to connect her/his stones.]

(;B[gn]C[Elom: Hmm--];W[kn]C[Elom: Black seems to have played the better game so far.]

(;B[jq]C[I'd move to the upper side.];W[kq];B[iq];W[jd]C[Good point.]

;W[bk]C[Elom: White got a lot of forcing moves, and black seems a tad overconcentrated.]

;W[he]C[Elom:With this move, black loses points AND possibilities on the upper side while white gets thick.]

It's hard to tell a style from one game, so I'd say that you seem to be a balanced player, but it seems that your reading ability is slightly behind your other good traits so maybe some Tsumego would help you avoid slipping up during fights.

Sorry for being late! Any questions just e-mail me. Good Game,
