T : Pretty standard up to here I guess.]
(;W[pl]LB[pk:B][qp:A]C[



T : White doesn't follow the joseki here (I show you a standard sequence, see variation), and it really is important to wonder how to answer this move. In order to take your decision, you need to think about two things : what are the ways to "punish" in the corner, and what does white threaten with this move. In the first variation (starting with A) I look at Black trying to punish, in the second variation (starting with B as in the game) we will see what advantage white gets with this Q8.]

(;B[pk]C[I don't know if I should react to this move or punish white for ignoring my previous move.]

(T : Note that Black can play R4 now too, see variation)]

T : This look important to me, if you omit it White gets a nice shape. Let us now imagine that White returns to the joseki with R4 (in order to answer the question at move 14). The White move in the game (P3) is tricky, but how to answer it is a bit "independant" from what we are studying now (is Q8 good or not, and how to answer it).]

(;W[oq]C[


T : I think White really got you with this move. Did you seriously consider blocking with P4 ? (see variation)]

(;B[pp];W[op];B[qp];W[qo];B[rq];W[no]C[




T : White gets a very nice position here, and K4 is getting weak.]
;B[ro]C[


T : This seems like a yose move, Black corner already was alive, and white won't play here now.]
;W[mp]C[


T : Now white is 100% alive and black's influence has disappeared.]

T : This is a very important move ! :-)];W[ch]
(;B[ej]C[


T : Before running to the center, I would poke White's shape while getting a small base with C8(see variation).]
;W[eh];B[el]C[


T : C8 still looks better to me.];W[cr];B[hk];W[kq];B[fc]C[Was creating another group a correct decision here? Or should I try to just reduce White group?


T : Good question. With L3 White threaten the base of your group, but if you defend he may secure a lot of point in the upper side and game will be hard for you. When you are rather late in the game you need to try things, so here I think F17 is a good idea.]
;W[eb];B[ic]C[


T : The shape looks wrong to me, this kind of diagonal play is rarely good I think.]

T : Black got a very nice result here, and in sente (I'm not sure that D13 is mandatory). We should take time now to wonder about the global situation, in order to know how to play now.

 Let us first evalate the score.

 Black has around 20 points on the upper right, about 10 on the lower right, and about 15 on the upper left corner, that makes around 45 points.

 White has around 10+ of the upper area, around 10 on the upper left area, about 10 on the lower right corner and about 10- on the lower side, then a total of 40, maybe plus komi. My calculations are very approximate, so let's say points are even.

  Influence seems to be even too, there is no real possible moyo.

 Last thing, are ther weak groups on the board ? Weak group can be counted as negative points, because attacking them will probably benefit the opponent. All White groups seem strong, mbybe the lower left has a bit of aji, but I don't think it is in danger, while Black has two weak groups, the two in the lower left quadrant.

 Finally, game looks better for White, because Black needs to defend before playing the yose. But still, Black has sente.

 The most important point for me here is K3, it secures points and safety of the group.]

T : While you only defended your weak groups, White got a moyo, maybe not that big, but probably enough to win. Do you see why weak groups hurt ?]
