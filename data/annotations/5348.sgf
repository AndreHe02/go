C[To the reviewer:

Hi and thanks for helping me.
In this game I thought I had the control (sente and/or being the one attacking), so getting such a close game felt kind of surprising. Please give me some hints on where I gave my opponent chances to catch up and failed to the lead. Or if I was actually never really in the lead.

Thank you!

Hi lolmao : I hope that my comments will help.
Just one piece of advice : you play far too conservative in the opening and the middle game. But too foolish in the yose : if the game is won, never play unwanted kos like u did : it could have costed you the game. Yours, Killgo]

(;B[fo]C[I wanted to force him to extend and then grab some points along my side, but this isn't much of a threat and the shape often invites problems; any suggestions?

Yes, you should use the strength of your corner enclosure to pincer him. He came really far to close to your strength. 
Or you should simply ignore him. 
The way you play F5 you make three moves just to get the corner : this is overconcentrated.]
;W[co];B[dj]C[Maybe hoshi here instead? :/

D10 is a good idea. Pity that it comes a bit late.];W[dp];B[cq]

(;B[jp]C[Is this too slow? I wanted to extend the d10 group but reasoned that if black d13 or c13, that would just give white free plays in the corner and get tons of points. On the other hand I didn't know what to do about it, and thus didn't play there.

Really Tooooo slow, yes. You are really strong under right, why reinforce it once more? You get over concentrated again : far too much stones for a few points and you lose the sente : you attack nothing.
Instead p4 or d15 are moves you must play instinctively.];W[oq]

Yes : if you pass here it s the same ^_^];W[rf];B[ql]C[This too.

Oh my god ! You pass 2 times in a row! Now I understand why your opponent is catching up so easily.]
