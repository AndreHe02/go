C[Thank you for considering reviewing my game.

I have added comments where I was unsure about a move.


Hello Charly,
I'm Tictoc (3k). I am glad to review this game and I hope my comments will be of some help. I will indicate my comments by a TT. As you will see, I like to keep them simple and to limit variations to a minimum, as I think too much info can boogle the mind. I tend to focus on a limited number of important moves, which I think can help you see things from an interesting perspective.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[qp];B[cn];W[cl]C[I like pincering here to deny black's mini-chinese opening.]
;B[en]C[This black's move is in theory inferior to taking the corner, is it not?

TT
It's less certain. Taking the corner gives points and keep a minimum of options for the outside. But this is feasible, especially if B makes outside influence a big part of his game.]
;W[fq]C[F4 instead to apply more pressure?

TT
Yes, F4 is more common. F3 says you hope to keep the corner for yourself, but at this point in the game, the corner is not so important. You want to keep options to attack and limit the influence of your adversary. F4 does that better. But F3 is not a major mistake.]
;B[dk];W[co];B[bn]
(;W[dl]C[I fill C9 was the correct move instead of this one.


TT
C9 is indeed the next move to play in the standard fuseki (see variation)]

TT
Not the best timing. This has limited influence on the four B stones that you are pressuring. Now is not the time to let B get away with his weak group, especially since your position also depends on one weak stone (A).
I feel a difference of 1k between players basically means two more bad/inefficient moves in the course of one game. If two players play the same mix of good and bad plays, things will be close, but two more moves like this on one side can give the game to the adversary.
In short, the game is not played yet, but you've just given B sente, and the advantage.]
;B[gk];W[fc]TR[fd][jd][nd][qf][pj]C[I didn't know what to do with the left side black was building. Should I be concerned about his Moyo at this point? Should I have considered something like Q11 instead?

TT
Those options all seem valid to me, including your actual play. After 30 stones, B has an advantage in influence and centre positioning. You cannot let that continue. From that perspective, I prefer Q10, as it plays farther from B's influence and it develops from your lower left, while reducing B's advantage in the centre.
As to the upper left, keep in mind that you can still destroy the corner in sente by playing 3-3. Even with another B stone in, you can still invade and reduce different ways.]
;B[fd];W[gd];B[ec];W[fe];B[ed];W[he]TR[nc][pf][pj]C[

TT
You're playing in B's stronghold. Better to keep your stones light. This is good shape, but you loose sente, you do not have an eye yet and B will make points attacking you from all sides.
So this stone might have been more useful, played far from there.]
;B[jc]C[Black chose to attack instead of defending the left side. I felt the need to reduce the left side. I don't think I found the correct move to do so.

TT
Keep in mind that another way to "solve" your opponent's point advantage is to give yourself points and/or potential of your own. This is why I think playing on the right side is a priority, over reduction.]
;W[ef]C[
TT
You think too much of reducing at this point, not enough about developing your own potential. This E14 is not efficient because all it announces is a possible reduction, not points, nor even life for your invading group.]
;B[gf]C[

TT
B could not let this nice peep pass.];W[ge];B[fl];W[nc]TR[pf]
[pj]C[

TT
Good tenuki, but the other side would be better. Here, you are putting another stone in potential danger while you already have a weak group. And you cannot expect much points from this side.
Let B thinks that he will swallow the whole upper left. He will not: even with a few more stones, blocking the flight path of your upper left group is too difficult. Having a stone on the fourth line on the right would actually help your left side groupe to escape, if need be.]
;B[oc]C[

TT
Terrible idea by B!];W[nd];B[qf]
(;W[jd]C[I disliked this attachment.
I felt I needed to try and connect the O16 and H15 groups somehow. This could've been a terrible disaster I feel.

TT
Easy formula to remember, often true: do not touch weak stones, play around them. B cannot hope to make this one live while cutting both W groups off. You can deal with this.
I'm proposing a variation.];B[kd];W[kc]C[This was a panic cross-cut from my side.

TT
Cross-cut is what you do to save something from a lone, weak stone. It is good for B here, not so much for you, because you have the upper hand locally.]
;B[id];W[je];B[ie];W[ic];B[hc];W[jb];B[hd]C[
TT
B did not play so well here, and you've managed to make the best of it.]
;W[gc];B[hb]C[This move was greedy. Would you consider the position of black with J14 instead of H18 better?

TT
More than greedy: this is a catastrophe for B! Your stones are safe and you're getting lots of points in his area of influence. He should have worked the underside connection failure before trying this second line play.
So yes, J14 is better for B.];W[if];B[ea];W[jf]C[

TT
Not so good: B could connect then]
(;B[hf]C[
TT
Another mistake by B.];W[ga]C[
TT
Good! Now B is probably getting wet under the armpits...];B[qk]
C[After black took this big point, I felt I needed to try and get some points off of the center. I started considering getting influence to develop the center.

TT
Your major success on the upper side gives you the advantage, so you could even consider playing it safe and piling up points. The centre is not easy for either of you and the gains are likely to be minimal.]

(;W[pj]C[
TT
You're asking for a fight. Playable, but not wise, because you have the upper hand. See peaceful variation.]

TT
Isolate his group before crushing it down.];B[rh]TR[ri][pj]
[qj][pk]C[
TT
He's safe, so now it's your stones that are beginning to look weak. The're not dead, of course, but the're not efficient either.]
;W[pn];B[pl];W[ol];B[pm];W[on];B[iq]TR[hq]C[This is good. Black is giving me the opportunity to chase around a weak group (I feel).

TT
I agree that you can (you must!) get something out of this, but it will not be so easy, because your left side has weaknesses. Attacking is about muscling up your position, first of all, so playing on the left was the right direction. I like H13 because you're now one stone away from a 20 points corner. And B has to react to this play.]
;W[kq]C[

TT
Do not push the ennemy toward your weak points. This is basically the root of the problem that evolved from there.]
;B[jp];W[kp];B[jo];W[ho];B[gn];W[in]TR[hq]C[

TT
Now was the time to connect under, while building the corner, lest you become the prey...]
;B[jn];W[im];B[jm];W[ik];B[jl];W[jj]C[

TT
The two last W stones are fine, because they work well with your centre, but you're not careful enough.]
;B[il];W[hl]TR[ef][oq]SQ[jj][ik]C[
TT
You've certainly figured this out already, but let's be clear: this is your third notable mistake, and contrary to the previous one (P3 is slow, E14 is close to useless in fuseki), this one will cost you.
You have to connect under, since the two top stones are under no danger.]
;B[fj]C[
TT
Still a chance to connect under...];W[lk];B[hm]C[
TT
Connecting under still possible... You've basically forgot that you could become vulnerable. It's difficult to keep both idea in our minds at the same time — offense and defense —, isn't it?]
;W[hk]
(;B[ll]C[Everything started to fall apart here. I guess there was too much aji around this area. How could I benefitted the most from black's weak group?

TT
Mmh... The best approach is to keep in mind that even if you do not kill this group, you've made B play for no points, while you now have a better option in the centre. So from there I would think about keeping the pressure on, while it is still possible, but only using safe plays.]
;W[mk]TR[mj]SQ[ok]C[

TT
I like N10 better: less aji at P9 for B. This is important, as your position has weaknesses.]
;B[om];W[nl];B[nm]
(;W[mm]TR[ml]C[

TT
Yes, this is where things take a turn for the worse. Let him connect, protect your big corner, do not encourage him into taking this important liberty at N8. Everything breaks apart because of this liberty that you're giving away.]

(;W[mn]C[

TT
Let him connect, defend.];B[nk]C[

TT
It's easier to discuss the game than to play it obviously... But still, it seems to me that a simple calculation should make you go for the right play: O10.]

(;W[ok];B[nj]
(;W[kj]C[Wrong and loosing move.

TT
But playing on the other side was also heavy with danger. We agree on the fact that you lost by going too far in attacking, getting too many weaknesses in the process. But this happened through a series of play, not just this one.]
;B[oi];W[qh];B[rg];W[pg];B[og];W[of];B[ph];W[pf];B[qg];W[pi]
;B[oh];W[mg]C[From now on I feel the game is over. I just played some other moves to find a suitable place to resign.

TT
I see. Well, I agree that at this point, this was difficult for W. But you had to continue, first by accessing the whole board situation. At our level (single-digit kyus), people make mistakes, and winning a won game is hard!]
;B[df]
(;W[cf]C[

TT Try not to let discouragement weaken your play. This is obviously not going to work. Simply shutting down the lower left actually keeps the game close.]

Thank you for the review in advance!

TT
All in all, you played well. I think you could take your go up a few notches easily, just by evaluating the score and keeping a cool head when fighting. Your fighting skills and overall calculation already seem accurate enough.
So my simple advice is to play slow games, in which you have time to think about strategy.

I hope this helps a bit!])

TT
Maybe you became discouraged too soon? After all, this doesn't look hopeless.

Maybe you should get into the habit of counting at important turning points, when you're considering your strategy for the rest of the game. Because I feel most of your important mistakes came because you had no real appreciation of the overall situation of the game (points, potential, weaknesses). In a sense, this is encouraging, because just by counting and adopting the correct strategy, according to the balance of points and influence, you'd keep the advantage when you get it, and choose safer options when it's the way to go.]

It seems B has lots of plays on the other side too. It seems you are going to loose the centre, and both your lower corners have important weaknesses, so the game is very difficult even if you save the group that actually died in the game.]

This might surprise you, but I think it is quite playable for W. The two W stones in the upper right have lots of aji. The group in the upper left is as good as alive, and it radiates strongly. To top this, you have sente and you can think about making points of your own.]

No points for B, but a solid group and outside influence for later. This works well with the 4-4 stone in the upper right, and it makes efficient a high approach on the lower right. Since W keeps sente, the result is even.]
