RE[W+60.5]

C[Bokudo: Hi, this is bokudo speaking. Thankyou very much for reviewing this game.
It was quite a difficult game for me since it was my first game after becoming 1dan. I have made alot of questions that I will very much appreciate if you could answer since it is some of the things I want to know about. I lost this game and ended up being degraded to 1kyu again, but I felt I made quite a few mistakes that I may or may not have noticed myself.
Anyways, thankyou for being willing to make this review :D

I am not sure how long time we spend on the game, but it took quite a while.

;B[cp];W[er];B[ck];W[qf];B[nc]TR[cd][ck]C[Az: This is probably fine, but having all three stones low feels a little odd to me, maybe o16 instead? (I really don't know...)]
;W[pj]
(;B[op]LB[nq:A]C[Maybe this was a wrong move? should I have played at O4, O3, E16 or something instead?

Az: The classic move with the Kobayashi fuseki (which is that this is on the right side) is to play at 'a', see variation. The goal is to avoid the high pincer, since it pushes you into a running battle where K10 will prove very valuable to white]

(;W[lp]LB[qq:E][qo:D][on:C][pn:B][pm:A]C[This was quite a troublesome pincer since I had never experienced it before, so I actually didn't know what to do with it, which is why I used quite some time to think about it. Any suggestions to the continuation from this point? I think the continuation I came up with was rather bad for me in this game.

Az: This is a very normal pincer, so you need to learn some of the basic joseki. 'a' is the most common move, but it is dangerous when white has support on both sides like this (and the influence it builds you won't help). 'b' starts a gigantic fight and is definetly unreasonble. 'c' starts a running fight when you counter attack his stone, but the white group in the LL corner is strong so this is questionable. 'd' aims to take influence, but again looks a little risky, so I would probaly settle with 'e' and make the base before deciding what to do next.]
;B[on];W[qn];B[ol];W[ql]LB[pm:A]C[Az: Missed chance for white to link up his stones in sente with 'a', after which it is very hard for black.]
;B[ip]LB[oq:C][rq:B][qq:A]C[Hmm, I feel I gave white too much at this point, even though I have fighting power and influence, but he has the advantage at this point right? and in such case, what could I have done different?

Az: First, exchange 'a' for 'b' in sente. You don't need to add another move, since even if you leave it you've prevented W 'c' later which is way too good for him. The fight is going to get rough, but white gets a for nothing if you don't fight so probably need to play something like this.]
;W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[ln]LB[lk:E][pi:D][oj:C][lo:B][ko:A]
C[Az: B 'a', W 'b', B 'c' W 'd' B 'e' would be one possibility]
;B[ll]C[I didn't see any other way than to try and keep him down there at the moment, any other moves that might have worked?

Az: See prev.];W[jn];B[jo]LB[in:B][ko:A]C[I think this is a bad move? even though I am not sure....

Az: This is too blunt. B wants to have peeped at 'a' first, now white wouldn't answer the way you want. B 'b' is more normal, it builds up strength for your group while keeping white seperated, and makes sure you don't get trapped]
;W[ko];B[in]C[andyolol [2k\]: ...

Az: This is good for white];W[jp];B[io];W[jq];B[jm]C[I should problably have blocked white with J3 or H3 or something instead?

Az: Yes, you must block at j3, it is the only possible move. White does not yet have eyes, and the left starts to look thin. Under no circumstances can white be allowed to connect here.]
;W[hr]
(;B[mo]C[Wasted move, I know... I am not sure why I made that, I felt my group was rather insecure at the moment, so I wasted a move on it, even though this didn't really bring me anything. Any thoughts or alternative moves? Do I even need to play additional moves to save the group?]
;W[kn];B[mm]C[Once again, I felt the group was unstable. Another wasted move?

Az: N5 is worse than passing, since it does active damage. This move is necessary to repair some of the damage from N5.]
;W[im]LB[jl:A]C[Auch, that one hurt. I think I reacted to it the right way, or?

Az: The best answer is to avoid getting into a mess like this a couple moves earlier, I would try to resist with 'a' just because black's only real hope is to keep white out of the center]

(;B[hm];W[il];B[gn];W[kl]MA[ll][mm][ol][on][mo][np][nq][op]
C[Az: Now the group is really weak and blacks prospects are grim.]
;B[kk];W[jk];B[kj];W[fn];B[fm];W[en]C[Az: Saving everything is going to fail - and if you're going to keep one group this is the wrong one. These black stones have no purpose anymore, they can't be used for fighting when white is completely connected and they don't have any terroritory. See var]

(;B[gk];W[em];B[fl];W[cm]C[Az: The black stones are unconditionally dead, it will be hard to win after this. Best to get a forcing move or two out of them, see var]

(;B[bn];W[bm];B[cn];W[el];B[dm]C[Was this the right move? or should I have played at B2?

Az: 1) B can't live here, 2) trying to live does more damage than letting the stones quietly die and using the aji later.]
;W[fj]LB[dl:A]C[Az: Strange decision for white, better to just block at 'a']
;B[dl]C[Did I get too greedy here? At the time I felt it was a good move, but now when I look at it, it looks quite greedy and with little importance at the moment.

Az: This is more important than the center, white was probably trying to play F10 in sente before coming back here.]
;W[gj];B[fk];W[ek];B[hk];W[hj];B[ik];W[ij];B[jj];W[jl];B[hl]
;W[km];B[go]C[Living in gote, it was all I could do I think, I couldn't find any alternatives to live at that moment.

Az: Black is lucky to be alive with both groups, but the damage is very large]
;W[cj]C[Az: Probably best to tenuki, see var]
(;B[bk]C[Too passive? Any other moves that I should have played instead? like E16 or instance? or something like that]
;W[mk];B[lk];W[ed]
(;B[ec]TR[cj][ek][fj][gj][hj][ij]C[I think I made a wrong choice here? should have played around D14 I think? or maybe even D16

Az: D14 doesn't make much sense since white is already on the side there. D16 is more interesting, but he has the choice of whether to go up or down, and the influence won't help you much, see var. This seems reasonable since W has thickness.]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[fc]C[Would B15 be better at this point?

Az: Yes.];W[fd];B[gd]C[I think I choose a bad joseki, his stones work too well together in that area now.

Az: Agreed, this also lets him starts a fight if he chooses. Better to play simply so close to thickness.]
;W[cc];B[bd];W[cb];B[be];W[ef]
(;B[cf]C[Hmm a mistake?

Az: If you don't know the o-nadare (large avalanche) joseki getting into this pattern at all is a big mistake ;) This is a legitimate move, though I think it would be better to end it quickly and keep the corner.]
;W[gc]C[Az: D18 is the only move]
(;B[gb];W[hc];B[ge]C[Az: This is courting disaster];W[ff];B[hb]
;W[ic];B[ie]C[That move was obviously a mistake. Should have played at D18 instead.

Az: Yes, but better at D18 directly ;) That way you won't have to nurse yet another weak group of stones and he won't have as many free moves.]
;W[db];B[eb];W[ea];B[fb];W[ib];B[da];W[ca];B[bb];W[ha];B[de]
LB[ci:A]C[Az: Pointless, play at 'a' directly to link up your stones.]
;W[je];B[ba]C[Az: Better to save these moves for a rainy day - or better yet, a ko fight. This destroys a lot of aji which you could activate later if your group is threatened.]
;W[ga];B[bc];W[fa];B[jf]TR[ie][ge][gd]LB[rd:A]C[Az: It's easy to get caught up in the moment, but why is black trying to save these 3 stones? The point value is small and they are sitting next to a rock of white stones. There are much more important moves, like 'a']
;W[if]C[At that moment I had messed up completely and lost my group so I desperately tried to save these last few stones. Any ideas for sabaki or something?

Az: Sabaki works better if they care about taking your stones; white doesn't have any pressing reason to take these stones now so they don't have much forcing ability. Just leave them be, you can do something later in yose.]
;B[hf];W[ig];B[hg];W[ih];B[jd];W[ke];B[kd];W[le];B[id];W[ld]
;B[lc];W[kc];B[lb];W[kb]C[Dead, what a shame.

Az: Game over. Trying to save 3 stones which weren't serving any purpose was the final nail in the coffin. Black is down at least 20 by the most optimistic count and has weak groups everywhere, end of comments.]
