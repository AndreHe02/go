C[Hi and thanks for every comment!

Hello Vincent, I'm Clement (cb22 on many go sites/forum). Thanks for submitting your game.
I'll add [cb22\] for my comments.

Let's try to help you as best as I can !

Please feel free to ask me in private on KGS if you have afterwards questions !]
;B[qd]C[I´m playing white here!];W[dd];B[pq];W[dp];B[oc];W[po]

(;B[ql]TR[oc][qd]C[[cb22\] So far so good for white. Black is playing an unexpected pincer. It feels strange because it doesn't put pressure on your stone and it's too wide from his shimari (triangle stones) to allow a great developpement (unless white let him do so)]

(;W[no]LB[qj:A][qn:C][oq:B]C[cb22 : you're not trying to profit from black mistake or I should say you're not getting anything here. The purpose of this jump is mainly to separate black stones and putting pressure and keeping q3 low. Black couldn't have make a connection with or without this move.

You're playing a standard joseki when black play high (q7 instead of r8, see var.) Maybe you should have attack q3 or counter pincer r8 (A, B or C)]
;B[nq];W[lo];B[lq];W[qi]C[maybe not the best mave here...
also the 3 jump maybe was not necessary but now i wanted to do something out of it!

cb22 : it works when black is high (q8 or r8) but here black can establish a small base with s5 easily and threat to connect and deprive white from a possible eye, so... :/]

(;B[pj];W[qj]C[cb22 : not best. you're only reinforcing black and suppressing a possible threat for later !]
;B[pk]C[cb22 : now black stones are 100% connected.];W[qk]C[cb22 : very bad move. you're bumping into black stones and make him reinforce his stones again. Just a question : what are you hoping when playing this ? black not to answer ?]
;B[pm]C[cb22 : now black has a tiger mouth connection, very solid. s8 will be also gote for white later and maybe a sente move for black !]
;W[qg]C[cb22 : too small, r14 better, bigger eye space];B[nl]
;W[cj]SQ[pa][qa][ra][sa][pb][qb][rb][sb][qc][rc][sc][rh][sh]
[ri][si][rj][sj][nk][ok][ol][pl][mq][oq][lr][mr][nr][or][pr]
[qr][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs]C[cb22 : take a look at your game. what black has and what white has...

So far, white made 6 points of real territory, and has a weak running group which has no chance of furhter developpement (so it's as good as dead IMO) + a good potential on west side. Black has almost two full corner + a living center group + sente. You're going to have to play very hard to disturb your opponent and hope for his mistake !]
;B[fc];W[df];B[db];W[cc];B[ic]
(;W[hp]LB[cn:B][dn:A]C[Maybe a or b better

cb22 : not sure what is better but third line move would have been. Problem is black center solid group. You cannot threat it to build another wall and hope to make a great moyo.]
;B[cn]
(;W[en]C[cb22 : strange move. You're letting black live easily ? It feels like you want to create a moyo in the center...]
;B[cq];W[dq]C[giving away the corner too easy..

cb22 : anyway the corner can't be saved with a 4x4 stone.];B[cp]

;W[rd];B[qc]C[cb22 : so good for black... big wall, big points !]
;W[rc];B[fe]C[Was afraid of the big wall with this move!

cb22 : black is playing on the best point here : he's developping is moyo and reduce your possible expansion !]
;W[kf]C[cb22 : well, sometimes, you got to go in !]
(;B[if];W[kh];B[lk];W[kj];B[kk]C[cb22 : take care, you're forcing black to split your two weakest group !]
;W[kd]C[Here i risk all to destroy most of his moyo!

Result: W+1.5

cb22 : to resume, your opening was pretty bad cos you didn't profit from black mistake early in the game (it's hard to know how to retaliate joseki mistake :/). Black was too selfconfident I think after middle game and that's why he loosed in the end. You manage to make a comeback, so well done ! (but your loss was near ;-))

Take care of you're weak group, try to establish quickly lifebase and when you're behind, like you've done, don't hesitate to throw in a stone to erase your opponent's territory ! But remember it's only when in front of a do or die situation !]
