C[Comment by Igo for Windows: Human strength is 5 Kyu.  Computer playing at level 5
This is a game played by me as white. I'm not sure if my basic opening strategy is sound. Any comments are appreciated.
I've tried to experiment with more aggressive playing and invading lately and feel like I'm making progress... I manage to beat a number of
people on small board but I suck terribly at the big one.];B[gd]
;W[df]C[Normally I would start with a e4 at this point, to get influence and put pressure on black. This is an opening I'm not really sure about on 9x9.

almost any move near the centre is good, as long as it's not too close to
the black stone (like f5 wld be)];B[cc]C[Quite simple extension.

Although d6 or d7 looks simpler.];W[ec]C[I jump in immediately. Does this suck?

No, this should be quite ok.]
(;B[fg]C[Black extends again but shouldn't he have played e6, or even e5?

E6 is the normal response and gives B a good result.
but this is ok too. black claims right side and c7 cant be killed yet.]
;W[eh]C[I want to protect my e7 but can't let computer invade lower left.

this is too defensive for w. if black playes e6 now, or c5 first then white
seems shortchanged];B[be]C[Well, computer extends again. I think this is a chicken move.]
;W[ce]C[This is probably a terrible move.

yes, when B answers b4 w achieved very little];B[ed]C[Well, finally he realizes.]
;W[dd]C[I'm ready to give up e7 now.];B[fh]C[Securing the upper position is tempting but black e3 here would be very bad.

Black d7 was a MUST. now w must d7 or f6. it's much bigger than anything on the
bottom];W[eg];B[fc]C[This definitely should've been d7.

How computers suck....];W[ee]C[First atari...];B[gf]C[He doesn't connect. I'm surprised :p]
;W[fd]C[Of course I capitalize.];B[fb];W[ge]C[I want to give him something to think about.]
;B[he];W[bf]C[Leave g5, not important. Here I think I should've e8'd, but I didn't want an extension from black b5 to b3.

If w doesn't want to play f5 here, then he shldnt have played g5 either!
E8 is better than B4. now b can connect at e8.
White e8 also threatens g7...];B[hc]C[Why not e8?

or f5?];W[ff];B[hg]C[Computer is a coward.

Agreed.];W[fe]
(;B[db]C[Why not e8?

d8 connects too, and prevents white d8 (after black e8)];W[eb]
;B[bd]C[Why not e9?

bad black];W[ea];B[da];W[bb]C[This is the major stone in the game. Is this a real kill or could computer save himself if he played right?

Looks like a real kill; black is so short of liberties he can't even get a seki or ko.]

(;B[cb];W[ba]C[Necessary. Actually, I begin to think that really was a good stone (b8)

black dead]
