C[I am black. I'm not sure of either the opponents or my rank. Both of us I think want to improve.

I would like to know what are the big areas that I need to work on in order to overall improve my game. Thank you!

E: Hi, my name is Evan.  I'll do my best to give you some useful direction.  I've marked my comments with an "E:"

After looking over the game, I'd say you have very good positional plays - you set up a very promising board at several points during the game. However, to make those positions pay off, you need to practice your fighting, reading and counting.  During fights, remember that a strong supporting extension can give you more than a forcing move.  Keep count of the territory and only fight for what you need. And don't sacrifice your splitting stones!]

;W[dr]C[XIVXX [-\]: Im afraid this wont be much of a challenge for you.]
;B[df]C[iambackart [?\]: why do you say that?];W[fd];B[dk]C[XIVXX [-\]: according to your game list you beat a 3d and considering the way you used the right side Im pretty sure your much better than me]

;B[bk];W[cf];B[cg]C[XIVXX [-\]: ah, I hate it when people do that]
;W[dg]C[E: This is the beginning of a complicated fight that marks the turning point in the game for black. So far, black is in good shape - now white makes some successful maneuvers.]
(;B[eg]LB[ef:A]C[E: Usually when you have a crosscut shape, you want to extend, not hane.  You want to be the one with the stronger stones.  It's hard to see whether this time was an exception to that rule.]
;W[dh]
(;B[ce]LB[ch:A]C[E: I'm still considering an extension over a hane.]
;W[bf]
(;B[ee]LB[be:D][de:C][ef:B][eh:A]C[E: This move is unreasonable.  Usually you make this shape to protect two cutting points at once. Here, it doesn't achieve that effect since D15 is still possible. 

So what is a better option? I think black should consider A,B,C, and D.]
;W[de];B[ed]C[E: Sacrificing d14 connects 4 separate white groups and splits black into four groups. It's a disaster! Black had to play E14 here, to keep any fighting spirit.]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[df]TR[ce][ee][cg][eg]C[E: Black has sad stones.]

(;B[fo]LB[ho:A]C[E: H5 is important here - you don't want to make white's H3 group to start leaping up through your center to try to escape - you want it to meekly return to the bottom left corner, while you make a big center.]
;W[fp];B[gp];W[ep];B[ho];W[gq];B[go];W[fr];B[fk]C[E: A promising moment in the game for black.]

C[E: Rudely interrupted.  This is a serious moment in the game. Black needs to decide what he can afford to lose.

Let's count.

White has around 30 points in the bottom left, 20 on the top left, 15 on the bottom right, and perhaps 8 on the top. That makes 73 total.

Black has around 20 points in the top right, and 25 on the bottom center. That's 45 total.

The rest of black's points must appear in the middle. Black want at least thirty points.  Is the territory underneath white's stones enough? Or do you need to kill that stone?

The triangles are 30 points of territory. I think black could snag these without killing K10 - perhaps starting at L9.]
(;B[je]C[E: This move is greedy. It wants to claim the entire center.  Now black is forced into a life and death struggle to kill white in the middle, or lose the game.]
;W[hb];B[gb];W[hc]C[XIVXX [-\]: even still Im going to have trouble with this influence]
;B[eh]C[E: This move would be better spent hurting the k10 stone.  L9 still looks good to me.]
;W[ok]
(;B[pn]LB[nl:A]C[E: I like O8 - it still protects the cut, but puts more pressure on white.]
;W[mj];B[ml];W[ll]
(;B[nk]LB[mk:A]C[E: N9 seems more secure.  Having weak stones just gives white free moves.]

(;B[nm]LB[nl:A]C[E: O8 means less free moves for white.];W[ln]
;B[im];W[nn];B[on];W[np]C[E: This is the worst scenario - white's group, flailing and trying to live, destroys black's territory. Now white has to be killed for black to win - and at this point, that's nearly out of the question.]
