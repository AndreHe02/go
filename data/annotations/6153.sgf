AB[pd][dp]C[I played black in this game. In the end I won by a few points but the difference was small (6.5pts and I had 2 handicap stones) and I always have difficulties in evaluating positions.
Thank you very much for the review!

When I evaluate a position, then a look at the following things:
-balance of territory
-balance of power (influence, e.g. a wall)
-weak and strong groups

Territory is important. At the end of the game it determines the winner.
Power (influeance) is important to attack and make territory.
Weak groups make urgent moves (either to defend or to attack).]

(;B[jd]TR[gq][dr]C[There is a weakness in the marked stones. See variation]
;W[go]C[This is a big move.
Imagine a black stone instead.];B[cj]C[I was satisfied with the result so far. With reason?

This oke for you!
The board is defided into two part, both approxiamately the same size. In the white part is more weakness, but white played one stone less.
One of the most important things is that you don't have weak groups!]
;W[of];B[jj]C[Is this a sensible move, or should I approach the lower right corner?
Would E15 be an alternative?

E15 is too slow, in my opinion. It already hard for white to do something in the upper left corner, so there is no need for defends their.

K10 is not a bad move. I would play O3, but it also depends on your style what to do.]
;W[dm]C[I was surepriesed about this attachemeny and unsure how to react.]
;B[cm]C[I tried to respond conservatively. Accepting some influence for white and securing my territory. Perhaps C6 would have been more peacefull?]
;W[cl]C[I had expected D8 instead];B[dl];W[em];B[cn]C[I thought long about this move. Perhaps capturing C8 with B8 is better? But I was too afraid of loosing D6 after the cut at C6.

[cn][dn][dp][cq]SQ[cj]C[This move seperates the triangle marked stones from the square marked stone]
;B[fn]LB[cj:3][fl:1][cn:2]C[I thought capturing was important because it connected my stones.

Yes it is. If white played here you would have three weak groups.]
;W[di];B[dg]C[I suspect that this move is not effective. where would the right spot to put preassure on the white group be? Or Tenuki?

One of the most remarkable things in this game is that allmost all moves are played inside blacks potential territory and not in whites potential territory.

I prefer tenuki. O3 is still a good move.

You gain something, but you lose the aji of C10.];W[ci];B[fg]
C[I'm trying to build Moyo while threatening to attack.

Your move is not really attacking, white doesn't answer it. It is very hard to kill the white C9 group.

I think it is time to do something about whites moyo.
Rule: when your opponent moyo is bigger than yours, get in!]

(;B[mc]C[I didn't want to give white a forcing move at M15 so I captured instead of L18.]
;W[id];B[je];W[ie];B[jf];W[if]
(;B[kf]C[Sensible result on the upper side up to now? I find it difficult to evaluate positions like this one.

White has a weak group, so that is good for you.

See also variation.];W[ih];B[gi]C[trying to keep his groups separated

Good.];W[ji];B[ij];W[bj]
(;B[ic]C[probably H17 would be a better attacking move?

There are two ways to live for the white the white J16 stones. 
1) make eyes
2) get out and connect with Q11 or other friendly stones

Option 2 is the most easy way for white. So probabily the best attack is to make sure white can't get out anymore.
The goal of attacking is not always killing a group. You can be satisfied if you gain advantage, e.g. influence.

See variations move 58.];W[hc];B[jb];W[fc]
(;B[ge]C[See variations for alternatives.];W[gd];B[hb]C[L11 instead? Or M11?

It is better to make sure white cannot get out.

Killing the white group is not the goal gaining advantage is often the goal of an attack. 
Attacking white, gaining influence in the center and use this influence to attack the right and lower side is a good strategy.]
;W[gb];B[eb]C[probably quite small.

Yes!];W[li]C[It is very important for white to get out.

L11 is better for white, I think.

See variation for a complex fight.]
(;B[kj]C[You are now helping white to defend his weak point (L11). Not a good move for you.]
;W[ki];B[nq]C[Is this the right direction for the approach? I have no idea which side is better.
Or a high approach?

This is a good move!];W[oq];B[np];W[pn];B[jp]C[I wanted to aim at a connection to K10. But now I think that K3 might have been better.(?)

K3 is better

Normally O3, O4 and K3 will life. There is no reason to connect at this moment]
;W[ir]SQ[go][gq][cr][dr]C[Important, the marked stones are not really strong, also an attack at your group.]
;B[pk];W[oj]TR[pk]SQ[jp][np][nq]C[Both marked groups are weak. It will be hard to keep both alive.]
;B[ok];W[qm];B[nj]C[aiming at connection to L10

O9 is better, I think. You are creating a cutting point.];W[ni]
;B[mj];W[mi];B[qj]C[M10 is better. As shown in the rest of the game.]
;W[qi];B[rc]TR[jp][np][nq]SQ[mj][nj][qj][ok][pk]C[small?
I naively expected white to answer...
I should probably have done something to protect the cuts at O9+M10 and then aimed to connect my bottom and center groups. Perhaps simply playing M10 is best (although it looked very small to me during the game)?

The marked groups are your weak groups. White will attack them. Arround O7 he will attack both groups with one move. Defending a weak group is not a small move! In the game you lose P9, Q9 and R10; that is big!]
;W[mf];B[le]C[I think I should not have answered here.

There are more urgent points, because you have weak groups.]
;W[nm]C[Here is the attack.];B[nl];W[mn];B[mo];W[ln];B[lo];W[jn]
;B[or];W[pr];B[jr]C[I'm desparately fighting for eyespace...]
;W[iq];B[lq]C[I had the feeling that a stone somewhere here could be helpfull to create eyes. But I'm unable to tell if this is the right spot.

I prefer K3.];W[nr];B[mr];W[os];B[jq]C[It seems alive now.]
;W[hg];B[gf]C[I probably should not have answered here, but played M10.

The white stone is not really an attack in my opinion. M10 is still the weak point in your position.]
;W[hl];B[gk]C[I feared to loose the connection to J10 if I didn't answer. And I wanted to keep E9 group separated.

Good strategy.];W[hk];B[hj];W[lj]C[The most important point at this moment.]
;B[lk];W[mk];B[ml]C[I decided that I could not save the Q9 stones and tried to limit the damage. Could they have lived on their own? (after bO9, wN8) I don't think so...

There is not enough space to live.];W[nk];B[kl];W[ol];B[om]
;W[pl];B[nn];W[pm]C[N7 better for white?];B[mm];W[io];B[ip]
;W[hp];B[re];W[rf];B[qe];W[gm];B[fm];W[bq]C[This is a big move.]
;B[bp];W[dq];B[cp];W[br];B[bh]C[Good];W[bl];B[sf]C[Good

This is where a stop to comment.

In my opinion is your style sometimes a little to conservative. Try to play some agressive moves; try to fight, you will learn for it.
Remember: defending a weak group is not a small move. If you lose a group, that's very good for your opponent.
