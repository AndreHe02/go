(;B[dj]L[de]C[This move is doubtful. When white has made this  particular pincer (high
 one-space) it is bad for black to tenuki. The black move is probably
 meant as a counter pincer, but since it only forces white to play tsuke  (attachment) at d15 [a\], which is what white wants to do anyway, it isn't  very effective.

See variation B for a popular joseki.];W[de]C[Good.]
(;B[jp]C[Black should probably play var B instead.]
(;W[nc]C[There is  nothing wrong with this move, but white could consider playing B instead.]
;B[pf];W[jd];B[cc];W[cd];B[bd];W[dd];B[cf];W[bc]L[df]C[Better to leave this aji for later and  complete the wall with d14 [a\].]
;B[df]M[dj]C[Good. This weakens white's  wall.];W[ef];B[cg];W[eg];B[fe]
;W[fd]L[ee]C[IMHO, it is better to connect solidly at e15 [a\]. That  is the prize to
pay for having a crack in the wall. Black's stone will be a ladder
breaker, but not much else, in the shadow of white's influence.
When/if white has to connect at [a\], the marked stone (f16) will be
too close to the wall.];B[ge]M[ce][cf][cg][df]C[Better for black to  patiently leave his kikashi and be happy with
the exchange that created bad aji for white. As the game will show,
black's marked group is too weak to make a cut really effective *yet*.
But if black patiently waits...];W[gd];B[he];W[hd]L[ee]C[If white connects at e15 [a\] instead, black  is left with a heavy group
to take care of.];B[ee]C[This starts a fight. The next few moves feels  unavoidable.]

[ab]C[
 sigue 9k*: b a17?

With d19 [a\], black can start a ko for the corner. To win, he ignores
one white ko threat to capture at b19 [b\]; then, when white carries out
his ko threat, black ends the ko at a18 [c\], ending in gote.
The corner is worth more than 15 pts, but since white gets 3 moves in
a row elsewhere, and black hasn't got any really attractive ko threats
yet, it is better to leave the ko for a while.];B[id];W[hc];B[ic];W[ib]
;B[jc];W[dk];B[ag]C[Good. The only move to live unconditionally. (Without fighting  the corner
ko.)];W[ne];B[ng]L[je]C[This move induces white k15 [a\],  which weakens black's troubled group
in the middle. He'd better play there himself.];W[je];B[ie];W[jg];B[hh]
;W[ld]L[kc][ji]C[I can't see any really severe moves  here for black. If black plays
marked stone, white seems to do allright by playing l17 [a\].
My choice is [b\] to haunt black further.];B[ej];W[ek];B[fj]L[dh]C[After this move, a white cut at [a\] starts  to look promising.]
;W[cn]L[fh][dh]C[I think white should play f12  [a\] to protect against the cut and
threaten to push out between black's stones. That makes it almost sente.
A black cut [b\] or a white move at [a\] make a big difference on the
safety of black's middle group. Both are urgent moves for some time.];B

;B[ob];W[oc];B[pc];W[nb]L[of]C[This is an yose  (endgame) move. If white wants to secure his group,
a better way is to cut through the keima with p14 [a\].];B[dh]L[fh][eh]
C[Good. Black finally decides to cut. White f12 [a\] is answered by
black e12 [b\].];W[og];B[of];W[nf];B[pg];W[oh];B[rg];W[rh];B[qh];W[qi];B
[qg];W[rj]L[sh][ri][en][mp]M[cn][ch][ci][cj][bj][dk][ek]C[This move makes black t12  [a\] atari. Locally, s11 [b\] is a better
move.

But white's left side group (marked) is weak and needs reinforcement.
A white move at e6 [c\] looks good. After that, white threatens to invade the  lower side, something that would be unthinkable before [c\]. A white move  around N4 [d\] is also bigger than the move played.]
