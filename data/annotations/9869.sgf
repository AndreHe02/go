Titleist37 [9k\]: hi gg

N: Hello, I am nico. I will be reviewing this game. It was specifically requested to look into the advice w gave b, so I will not remove any of the commentary. My own comments begin with "N:" (at least until move 88, because by that point there are no comments other than my own).

I may also provide other comments and variations.

Unfortunately, this means you might have to hunt around a bit to find all of my comments, because they may be buried in some variations w showed b. I cannot think of a good way to fix this.]

(;W[jp];B[mq];W[cn]C[N: Both F3 as suggested and G3 are fine moves. G3 is a little more severe vs. the K4 stone.]

(;B[gq]LB[eq:A]C[myopian [4k\]: i used to play with jack nicklaus tilteist
Titleist37 [9k\]: i see
myopian [4k\]: aji
myopian [4k\]: a is aji
myopian [4k\]: later w can cut there
Titleist37 [9k\]: its a good option];W[cq]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: a is better
myopian [4k\]: also, g3 gives w more room to enter here];B[cp]
C[Titleist37 [9k\]: its my favriot club still
Titleist37 [9k\]: now days club is so improved
Titleist37 [9k\]: g3 is your posetion isnt it]
(;W[bp]C[N: This is not the normal way for w to play this invasion. While the invasion IS joseki, I'm not sure I would recommend playing it in a handicap game anyways. See variation here for the normal play.]

;W[er]C[myopian [4k\]: etc
Titleist37 [9k\]: understand]
(;B[eq]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: this is the one of the rutin isnt it
myopian [4k\]: if g3 were at f3, b could tenuki instead of having to add another stone
myopian [4k\]: although, even here, i dont think e3 is necessary
myopian [4k\]: im just saying this move is unnecessary];W[fr]
LB[cj:5][ck:4][cl:3][cm:2][cn:1][hp:A]TR[fq]SQ[bo][co][dp][eq]
C[Titleist37 [9k\]: from there?
myopian [4k\]: this is the wall
myopian [4k\]: how high is it?
Titleist37 [9k\]: then d6 osae is option movew
Titleist37 [9k\]: or e6
myopian [4k\]: so what?
myopian [4k\]: w would be daft to try to run c6
myopian [4k\]: beginner move
myopian [4k\]: 20kyu move
Titleist37 [9k\]: at this point i didnt wana lose those 5stone
myopian [4k\]: of course not! i agree
myopian [4k\]: but they are not in danger
myopian [4k\]: quite the opposite
Titleist37 [9k\]: at this point best move is where ?
myopian [4k\]: how long have you been playing?
Titleist37 [9k\]: about one year
myopian [4k\]: and how old are you?
Titleist37 [9k\]: I m 48
Titleist37 [9k\]: started late
myopian [4k\]: wow!  youve donw well to reach 9k in one year
Titleist37 [9k\]: im tring
myopian [4k\]: but its gonna get tough to climb higher
myopian [4k\]: you need to learn some basics from a teacher or a book
Titleist37 [9k\]: thats my wish
myopian [4k\]: you cant teach yourself
Titleist37 [9k\]: that is my problem
myopian [4k\]: i recommend guo juan on internet
Titleist37 [9k\]: i dont know rutin move at all
myopian [4k\]: rutin?
Titleist37 [9k\]: basic move
Titleist37 [9k\]: at corner 3,3
myopian [4k\]: theres no such thing as a basic MOVE
myopian [4k\]: but there are basic PRINCIPLES
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: there are also joseki, such as invading at 33
myopian [4k\]: but joseki are complicated
myopian [4k\]: hey are pro level play
Titleist37 [9k\]: i suck at joseki
myopian [4k\]: one slip and you fall down completely
myopian [4k\]: so safer to learn basic principles first
myopian [4k\]: such as how far to jump from a wall
myopian [4k\]: so, how high is blacks wall here?
Titleist37 [9k\]: e5
myopian [4k\]: please just asnwer my question
Titleist37 [9k\]: f5
myopian [4k\]: how high is a number!
Titleist37 [9k\]: no wall there
myopian [4k\]: and this one....
Titleist37 [9k\]: e4
myopian [4k\]: has 4 stones
myopian [4k\]: so its 4 high
myopian [4k\]: so jump 5 spaces
Titleist37 [9k\]: where
myopian [4k\]: from c3
myopian [4k\]: sorry, from c5
Titleist37 [9k\]: 5
myopian [4k\]: so c10 would be a good place for black to play


N: This wall reaches all the way to G3, so I think it is 6 spaces high. Also I think a w push and cut with triangle might be a bit of a problem. If I was b I would probably play at A, which also serves to damage the K4 stone.

Of note, I think the "height of the wall +1" idea, while very popular, is a pretty bad rule of thumb. At it's best, it is just a special case of "play away from thickness", and at its worst it will have you playing too close to strong positions or too far away from weak ones, because all you are looking at is the height of the wall instead of the strength of the group, which is the real issue.

That said, the principle is well explained.]
(;B[cl]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: tenuki
Titleist37 [9k\]: how about this one
myopian [4k\]: this lone is too close to b5
Titleist37 [9k\]: where to be
myopian [4k\]: simple rule: jump height of wall +1
myopian [4k\]: if wall is only one stone, jump 2 spaces
Titleist37 [9k\]: i wanted atack c6
myopian [4k\]: if 2 sone wall, jump 3
Titleist37 [9k\]: and go up side
myopian [4k\]: c3 is of minor importance
myopian [4k\]: and its already going nowhere
myopian [4k\]: so forget about it
Titleist37 [9k\]: of
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: much more significant is k4
myopian [4k\]: but, lets say you want to jump on the left; how many spaces?
myopian [4k\]: ie, how high is your wall?
Titleist37 [9k\]: may be15];W[cj]LB[el:A][fm:B][hn:C]TR[ch]
SQ[jp]C[myopian [4k\]: cut through the line between these two
Titleist37 [9k\]: separate those two
myopian [4k\]: yes, any pof these
myopian [4k\]: i like B
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: however,...
myopian [4k\]: :)
myopian [4k\]: i wouldnt play B myself
Titleist37 [9k\]: for me a is strong
myopian [4k\]: theres another principle
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: push enemy TOWARDS your wall if you have one
myopian [4k\]: therefore

N: Bad move: This is way too close to b thick group. This gives b a chance to attack strongly with triangle.]

(;B[dm]C[myopian [4k\]: cramped answer by b]
(;W[cf]C[myopian [4k\]: this was an overplay by w
Titleist37 [9k\]: thats why i went c12
myopian [4k\]: and even in an even game thos is playable, because w should stay awy ffrom b's wall in lower lwft

N: I think this move is OK.];B[ch]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: F 17
myopian [4k\]: yes, you played this]
(;W[ej]LB[bj:A]TR[dd]SQ[cl][dm]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: and i did this
myopian [4k\]: this is risky

N: Yes, this looks like an overplay. Note that the b square stones are strong, and the b triangle stone is not strong. It therefore makes much more sense to pull out the C14 stone instead.

Also of note, b has a tesuji to connect under at A. This tesuji does not exist on the other side.]
;B[eh]C[myopian [4k\]: good move];W[bd]LB[df:A][sk:B]TR[cf]
[cj]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: go on please
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: b must keep these apart

N: This is also a mistake. B should probably play at A now to connect everything up.]

(;B[fc]C[myopian [4k\]: wrong way]
(;W[cc]LB[df:B][cg:A]C[myopian [4k\]: w still thi9nking of linking at b12
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: but since you gave me an opportunity to take the corner, i took it, thanks very much! :)

N: I thik this is suspect. Since b has already defended at F17 then the corner group is quite strong. B can now think to play at A. Note that A is nearly sente (w REALLY wants to answer at B) but if w responds it gives b an extra tempo to attack the F10 stones. Note that the b group at the top cannot be attacked effectively even if w extends at B.]
;B[jd]LB[cj:A][jp:B]C[N: A very patient move, but not my style at all. Note that w has at least two weak groups at A and B, so if I was b I would be interested in starting a fight.]
;W[qn];B[ql]LB[ro:B][qp:A]TR[rn][qo]C[N:Since N3 is a large knights move, that means that the corner is a) weaker and b) bigger than if b had played at O3 Hence, it is common for b to just take the corner territory here. If A feels too passive, b can also think to play at B, which is a bit more severe vs the w position.]
;W[nq]C[N:I am going to assume that w knows perfectly well that this is an overplay and is playing this as part of a handicap strategy.]
;B[mp];W[qq]LB[oo:A][op:B]C[myopian [4k\]: tricky situation here
myopian [4k\]: but there a simple way to look at it
Titleist37 [9k\]: magari o4
myopian [4k\]: which has more territory prospects, the bottom side or the right side?
Titleist37 [9k\]: right side
myopian [4k\]: yes
myopian [4k\]: therefore?
Titleist37 [9k\]: so r3

N: I expected w at A or B here to try to confuse b.  This way b has an easy solution with R4.]

(;B[np]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: very happy];W[qp]CR[pl][om][pm][nn]
[on][mo][no]TR[ql][mp]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: that
myopian [4k\]: this is the line
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok
myopian [4k\]: anywhere on it ok]
(;B[po];W[or]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: I really see

N: This has the unfortunate (for b) side effect of making K4 a little lighter, since w can now play N2 here.]

(;B[oq]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: that move I dont have in my brain]
;W[nr]
(;B[qo];W[ro]
(;B[pn]C[N: Lets stop here for a second and take a look at the whole board. Note that all w has done is taken tiny corner territory and given b all the initiative. This is not the way to play a handicap game (or an even game for that matter, but in a handicap game it is worse) and I would expect w to loose.]
;W[rn]SQ[pn][mp]C[Titleist37 [9k\]: nobi
myopian [4k\]: b pretty solid
Titleist37 [9k\]: key point

N: From here we have the last w comment on a b move. I am a bit surprised because to here it seems b has done quite well. The real issues don't start until b overlooks an atari at move 140, where b fails in a fight, see comment there for how b could simply kill w and win.]

(;B[pl]LB[om:A]C[N: Not only is this slow, it is really weird shape. If b was going to add another move here, it should be at Q7. This way it leaves a defect, and w has aji to peep at A, for instance.]
;W[go];B[fp]C[N:Really weird way to connect. F3 or G4 are both more normal.]
;W[en];B[dn]C[N: B play is very submissive here, but since this is a handicap game I am not too surprised.]
;W[fl]C[N:Good moves from w here. The many weak groups are now easier to handle. This does mean that b gets to play first in the upper right corner of the board though.]
;B[jr]C[N: What the hell is this??!!];W[hq];B[hr];W[nc];B[nd]
LB[fk:A]C[N:Since b went to the trouble of playing K2, b migh as well try to use it for something, ignoring O17 and attacking the w bottom group, perhaps by trying to cut at A or something.]
;W[md];B[ne];W[qf]LB[oc:A]C[N:Really odd timing here. B can immediately take A and I have no idea how w is going to respond.]
;B[qh];W[nf];B[me];W[hc]C[N:W just continues to overplay here. These are common handicap tricks. I do not believe this kind of trick is really necessary though, and I usually play my HC games as straight as I can. Since b is a weak player he will usually make mistakes and all w has to do is capitalize when given the chance.]
;B[hd];W[gd];B[gc];W[id];B[he];W[ie];B[ic]C[N: B unfazed. W tricks are backfiring.]
;W[jc];B[hb];W[kd];B[je];W[if];B[kc]TR[ke]C[N: I think triangle would probably be even better for b.]
;W[lc];B[jb];W[le];B[ke]C[b first misstep, but w already took quite a bit of damage here. B correct move is f course M14, but actually if I was b I might just play the simple move at N14, which will do plenty to punish w overplay and has less risk of going bonkers.]
;W[oc];B[od]C[N: Very surprised there is no w comment about this empty triangle. I realize all the commentary has ended, but this seems to be one of the clearest mistakes b makes this whole game.]
;W[pc];B[lf]C[B big misstep here. R16 is very big.  B  still is OK after this, but this is where w overplays finally start to pay off.]
;W[qd];B[ld];W[qc];B[pf];W[pg]TR[qg]C[N:This hane does not work. B can just cut at R13 (marked).]
;B[of];W[qg];B[ph];W[og];B[oh]C[Terrible shape.

BTW: Going to stop prefacing my comments with "N:" because from here on there are no other comments.]
;W[nh];B[ni];W[mi];B[mj];W[rh];B[qi]LB[mh:B][oj:A]C[Correct play for b here is to connect at A or to atari at B]
;W[ri];B[qj];W[hf]LB[df:A]C[Loooks like a desperation move. B can easily just reply at A]

Titleist37 [9k\]: for me its like a god
myopian [4k\]: 5d is good
myopian [4k\]: 9 pro is god
myopian [4k\]: actually, not even 9d...
Titleist37 [9k\]: im 9k so
Titleist37 [9k\]: sad place
myopian [4k\]: so you are a 48 year old who has just started learning; 9k is very respectable
myopian [4k\]: and besides, theres something else you need to know
Titleist37 [9k\]: no way Jose!
myopian [4k\]: top Go players are like top chess players and like top mathematicians; they are all austistic savants
Titleist37 [9k\]: I wanna be at least 3k
myopian [4k\]: you will be, after a few more years
Titleist37 [9k\]: hopfully
myopian [4k\]: but quite honestly, go is an absolute waste of time
Titleist37 [9k\]: dont say that
myopian [4k\]: lean music instead
myopian [4k\]: or football
Titleist37 [9k\]: im enjoying this game
myopian [4k\]: or how to please women
myopian [4k\]: or just about anything else
Titleist37 [9k\]: life is long so I will cover all that
myopian [4k\]: go has a curious attraction; it looks easy but is hard
myopian [4k\]: so its a kind of devil
Titleist37 [9k\]: that why Im tring now
Titleist37 [9k\]: its a challenge for me
myopian [4k\]: dont forget you have to work; i am lucky i dont have to any more
myopian [4k\]: i can waste my life if i want
Titleist37 [9k\]: you have time so, you must enjoy your life,
myopian [4k\]: must?   there's no "must" about life
myopian [4k\]: life is for enjoying, not for achieving greatness
Titleist37 [9k\]: ok then, enjoy, and be happy
myopian [4k\]: i give you one more thing to look at, just a mo...
Titleist37 [9k\]: I totally agree with you

N: This is a very aggressive -- and possibly risky -- plan. Note that w can connect at A so this allows w to possibly take advantage of the difference in strength and try something nasty. I think just b at D14 would be better.]

;W[en];B[fn];W[fm];B[gn];W[bn];B[ao];W[cj]C[N: There are several choices for how to handle w on the left side. This seems appropriate for the position.

I am not sure this is actually a good result for w here. B extra height at G6 makes the K4 stone look very weak, and b als has a stone at tengen and at D16. The w corner is small, and the philosophy of the immediate invasion is that the b move at G3 indicates that the bottom side is probably not that interesting, so the thickness faces the wrong direction. Unfortunately, that is not the case here. B is very happy to develop the bottom side.]

Titleist37 [9k\]: ok];W[cq]LB[gq:A]C[N: I really doubt w would invade here. W will probably add a move on the left side. Note that because F3 is so close to D4 w has a nice option to settle K4 by attatching at A. I think both moves are OK.]

;W[dp];B[oq]LB[qf:A]C[This is the Hashimoto opening, also called the "Orthodox". It is extremely common. Recently there is a lot of w at A here, which is a modern korean idea, but it is still quite common to see this played as follows.]
;W[qj]C[This is the older japanese style, but it is still common nowadays.]
;B[ql];W[qf]C[Note this move is here, not at R13. W at R13 is too soft vs. the b corner. B has a couple of ways to reply, but the most common is to invade at R12 as follows.]
;B[qh];W[of];B[nd];W[rd];B[qc]LB[pi:A]C[Also reasonably common is this move at A. Because of this there is also a variation where w plays A immediately instead of S16, but that variation is usually considered slightly inferior.]
;W[pi]C[This is the common pattern. B almost certainly will continue with a move around K17 (although b could have played O17 instead of O16, thus negating the need for this extra move on top).

The key is that w extends 3 spaces to R14 instead of R13 and is still perfectly fine because the b corner needs some reinforcement.]
