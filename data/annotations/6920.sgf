;B[cp];W[pq];B[od];W[dd];B[pj];W[qd]C[not sure if this is a good approach

*I think it's ok.];B[qe];W[re];B[rd];W[rc]C[any better moves for white than this?

* Black S16 looks bad. S17 is the correct response.];B[rf];W[sd]
;B[pe];W[pc];B[cf];W[ch];B[cc];W[cd];B[dc];W[ed];B[bd];W[be]
;B[bc];W[ce];B[fc];W[eq];B[gq];W[eo];B[cn];W[gp]C[H4 better for white?

* Yes, H4 is better to put G3 under pressure. Attaching to a wek stone strengthens it.]
;B[hp];W[go];B[iq];W[cl];B[dq]C[* I think White should play F3 or E2 to keep Black's groups separated.]
;W[el];B[bf];W[ae];B[oc]C[Maybe too small

* I agree. White is fully alive and needn't answer. The top is not black territory, so this is too small.]
;W[hc]LB[ge:A]C[this h17 seems bad, what would be a better move for white?

* A move at A would be good to build a big moyo and destroy Black's hopes for a moyo after P17. But i don't think H17 is bad.]
;B[gc];W[ge]C[* White still gets to build a moyo. Black should probably have played F16.]
;B[fg];W[hh]LB[hg:A]C[what should white do in this situation instead?

* This move looks strange. Black can get out at A. A would be the typical point to attack the black stone.]
;B[hg];W[ig];B[gh];W[hi];B[gi];W[hj];B[cj]C[D14 first for black?

* Yes, D14 would have been a good idea.];W[df];B[dg];W[cg];B[ef]
;W[de];B[hf];W[dj];B[if]C[* Now White's moyo is gone while Black has some potential at the top. This is due to White's mistake at H12.]
;W[qo];B[hd];W[ic]C[* This makes White very heavy. White should just sacrifice H17.]

;W[mi];B[ni];W[nh];B[ng];W[oh];B[mg];W[lk];B[pr];W[qr]C[any better answers to q2 in this situation?

* P2 is the typical answer. I think R2 is too passive.];B[mq]

C[N9 instead of L7 kills?

* Yes, I think so.];W[mj];B[kk];W[nk];B[pi];W[nl];B[rn];W[bq]
;B[dr];W[bo];B[bp];W[bn];B[co];W[cm];B[fq]C[white resigns

* Thanks for letting me review this game. I think both players played reasonably most of the game.
White had the better start. H12 and J17 were the mistakes which cost the game.]
