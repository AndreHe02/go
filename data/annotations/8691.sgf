C[Me to move first.

My opponent was 9 kyu; I was 24! I expected to lose this game and I did. However, I think I could learn a lot from it!

I'm particularly interested to know what went wrong in the beginning, and at what point my opponent had secured victory. What chances did I miss?

[L\] Hi, my comments will be marked by "[L\]"];B[pd];W[dq];B[dc]
;W[pp];B[qn];W[nq]
(;B[qf]TR[qn]C[[L\] I don't think this move is bad, since is just beginning, but you leave marked stone alone and close to your oponents - I'd prefer to play one of alternate moves here]
;W[on];B[om]TR[oi][oj][pj][pi][pk][ok]C[I expected my opponent to react to this attachment; however, he completely ignores it!

[L\] It's early in the game and I think he can afford to ignore it - no need to start fighting now or help you build stronger position - like this, he can always invade marked area]
;W[hp]TR[cf][ce][de][df][ci][di][dj][cj][ic][jc][kc][kd][jd]
[id][hd][hc]C[[L\] Greedy move. I think it's better to play somewhere else]
;B[ce]C[[L\] Good];W[jd]C[[L\] Invasion i urgent, because your moyo could be too deep]
;B[ld]TR[lc][hc]C[[L\] Good, Though I'd prefer to play M17 or H17, to rob his stone of base. But that is just a matter of taste.]
;W[gd];B[fc]C[[L\] Maybe OK, but it seems too overcrowded and it's forcing him to make a good shape. Maybe F18 or G18 would be better.]
;W[gc]
(;B[fd]C[[L\] This is not accomplishin anything. Bette to play elsewhere.]
;W[jf];B[dh]TR[nm][om][pm][pl][ol][nl][cn][dn][dm][cm]C[[L\] seems too small, there are bigger places to play]
;W[do]C[[L\] Very big move];B[dm]TR[oj][pj][pi][oi][pk][ok]
[dk][dj][nd][mc]C[At this point I was quite pleased with how it was going. I thought I had secured more of the edge than he had, and the center was all to fight for.

However, my opponent claimed I was not being aggressive enough in the opening.

[L\] And he was correct. He can still invade marked areas, while his position and moyo is fairly secure.]
;W[qj]
(;B[qh]TR[om][qn]C[[L\] Wrong direction - you're only making your marked stones weaker.]
;W[ql];B[pj]TR[om][qn]C[[L\] Still leaving your stones weak]
;W[pm]
(;B[ol];W[po];B[pn]TR[kb][ge][fh][fn]C[I thought I could weaken white's stones with this! However, in retrospect I was just putting stones somewhere I could never defend them.

[L\] yes, there's no chance to save them now
beter to play somewhere else.];W[qo];B[pl];W[qm];B[qk];W[rk]
;B[pk];W[rj]
(;B[qi];W[jb]C[[L\] small, but it does make base and leaves you open at the top right]
(;B[gf]TR[fn][gi][fm]C[Here I was thinking that I should contain white's group at the top, and then the center would be mine. My opponent however, had other ideas.

[L\] this move would be good, if you had stones at marked positions, but like this, I'd prefer to play variation]
;W[jh]
(;B[hh]C[[L\] you're building small teritorry, while leaving top right wide open. His group is already strong and it cannot be killed, so it's better to turn your attention to your own weaknesses.]
;W[mc];B[md];W[lc];B[nc];W[mg]C[[L\] Ignore, better play elsewhere, since you have no more any moyo here]
(;B[mf];W[lf];B[nf];W[nn];B[rn];W[rm];B[ri];W[fm];B[fl];W[gl]
(;B[fk]C[I was starting to feel a bit constrained here!

[L\] He's building a huge moyo, better to cut here and hope for the best.]
;W[cn];B[gm]C[I thought my opponent had left a weakness, and I could cross-cut these stones.

[L\] correct];W[hm];B[gn];W[fn]

;B[he]C[In the next few moves, white rips through the center and removes all hope.

[L\] there was no hope left, W leads by at least 30 points already]
;W[ki];B[kj];W[jj];B[jk];W[kk];B[lj];W[jl];B[kl];W[ik]C[A brilliant attack from white, that I hadn't seen coming!

[L\] Give it a while, you'll see these moves soon enough. Center aws unforunately not secured the whole time and even if, it would still be too little.]
;B[km];W[di];B[ei];W[bi]
(;B[ej]C[[L\] no need, better to secure left side];W[af]TR[bi]

[L\] I hope at least some of my comments will be useful to you. Not being strong player myself, I can't offer best possible advice, but maybe this helps a little. I suggest for you to try and solve as many tsumego problems as you can (life and death and tesuji) - it helps reading and improves your game a lot. Don't be affraid to fight it out - sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, but you can always try to learn from your mistakes (as well as from your oponents).

I think you did pretty well for 24kyu (would've guessed you to be about 15).

If you have any questions, let me know - I'll try to anwer them, if I can.

Have fun and best luck in your future games!])
