C[Dear Reviewer,
Thank for your help.
I played Black in this game (0.5 komi) and lost by 2.5 points.

I think I may have done some small mistakes during the yose, but what I would like more to learn are mistakes during the openning and middle game. For example - did I tenuki at the right time? Did I chose the right direction?
Besides, any other comment is welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Avi.

Hi Avi,

I will do my best although I am not strong enough to give the perfect answers.

-inimino];B[pd];W[cp];B[pp];W[dc];B[ep];W[dn];B[cq];W[bq];B[dq]
;W[bo];B[iq];W[qn];B[ql]C[A: I thought this is the right direction, squeezing white and building territory on both sides. In the game, however white built a big territory in the corner as well. Should I have just played O4?

inimino: I agree with this move.  O4 is a little too easy for w, and right side seems more interesting.]
;W[nq];B[oo];W[qq]
(;B[qp]C[A: Is it the right side to block?

inimino: No.  Bottom side is bigger, so, O3 is better stone to weaken.  Killing R6 is worth little since right side is still open.]
;W[pq];B[lq];W[rp];B[ro];W[rq];B[rn];W[mq]C[A: This seemed to me rather slack on white's side, so I tenukied. Is it correct?

inimino: I think tenuki is correct.  With J3 present, any follow-up to this move is small.  This w move is defensive, otherwise P2 is large.]
;B[de]C[inimino: D11 seems better on this side to me.  Top side seems even better...  Maybe wrong but I would try to play on the top side instead of this.  Better to build out from the top right corner and let w worry about invading, rather than try to worry about the left side which alone would not be enough for w.]
;W[ee];B[ef];W[ed];B[cf]C[inimino: D13 seems a little better so you can move out more easily into the center.]
;W[cj];B[cc];W[cb];B[cd];W[jd];B[nc]C[inimino: I would prefer M17 here.]
;W[qf];B[qh];W[rd];B[qc];W[rc];B[rb];W[qd];B[pc];W[pe];B[oh]
;W[rg];B[rh];W[nf];B[bb]TR[me]C[A: I am not sure about this move. Probably extending to M17 would have been better?

inimino: Yes I think so.  You were still nervous about this somewhat weak group, I guess, but O17 group is weaker, and almost entirely enclosed.  If w ignores this move, will you really be content to play D18?  If not this is not sente.  Maybe instead of M17 I would think about N15, better to get your group out above all.  If you really wanted to live locally I would try K18.]
;W[lc]C[A: Good move for white.

inimino: Yes.];B[md];W[ld];B[me];W[mg];B[mi]C[inimino: This is big, but also, feels a little greedy.  The M14 escape keeps w groups separated aiming at H16.]
;W[mb];B[nb];W[sb];B[qb]C[inimino: White can still kill this shape and chase the group.]
;W[no];B[nn];W[op];B[on];W[mn]
(;B[mm]C[A: Too passive? Should I cut at N5?

inimino: Perhaps.  Given the weakness of M3, I am not sure how well that will work out, see variation for one likely continuation.  I think the difference is not that great.]
;W[hq]
(;B[hp]C[inimino: After a little reading, J4 looks better here.]
;W[ip]
(;B[gp]C[inimino: This move gives up a lot of points, I wonder if you have other options here.  I would look at K3, and if you think that is unreasonable try H2.]
;W[jq];B[ir];W[jr];B[hr];W[kp];B[io];W[jp];B[mo];W[ln];B[np]
;W[oq]
(;B[dl]C[A: M4 seems to me better now.

inimino: M4 is small, w simply connect at M2.  It is sente, but w should assume b will connect it eventually and I think it is not interesting right now for either player (although b can play it almost any time).

In other words, if M4 here, then w M2 and you still play D8, the position is the same except you have a little less aji.  It's not like w was going to be in any hurry to play M4 here.

Incidentally, there are other uses for aji around M4 that could be nicer.  See variation starting with L6.]
;W[cl]
(;B[cm]C[inimino: I wonder if there is a better move here... the trouble I have with this is that if b ends in gote here with just a small wall, I don't think that is the right time for that.  And if b doesn't take gote I think he will not have a wall here.]
;W[dm];B[ck];W[bl];B[dj];W[bk];B[dk];W[ci]
(;B[fk]C[inimino: This feels a bit slow.  I'm not sure what the intention of this move is.  H16 looks more interesting.]
;W[lo]C[A: Yes,  missed the chance to play M4.

inimino: And now you cannot play L6 which would have looked very nice here for b as well.]
;B[em]C[inimino: This is small.];W[en];B[fm];W[ff]C[inimino: This is huge.]
;B[hg];W[he]C[inimino: So in my opinion, the real missed opportunity during this part of the game was not M4 but H16.]

;B[ne];W[oe];B[od];W[ml];B[lm];W[km]
(;B[nm]C[inimino: I think it is not necessary to connect, you can push first and then cut, see var.]
;W[in]C[A: I think M8 is better for white.];B[ll];W[qo];B[po]
;W[rm];B[qm];W[sn];B[pn];W[so];B[kk];W[jk];B[jl]C[A: Using the aji of M4.

inimino: That is an exchange w should be happy to make, see the variation on next move.

I think both players overvalued M4 at several points in this game.  White made so many mistakes by trying to prevent M4 when he should just allow it and strengthen his shape.]
