C[Hi, thanks for reviewing my game.

The game was, overall, quite evenly matched, and I feel that my opponent is as strong as, perhaps a bit stronger, than me.

I feel that it is a very good game, at least up till move 204. From that point on, the game was pretty much set.

MR: Your game is quite difficult ... and I am not sure that I could answer all the questions you posed. At least I tried to answer as many as possible ...

After all, I think that one main point is that you get yourself caught into fights that are not necessary good for you and tend to develop into (more or less) one way streets. There are some points in the game where I had chosen more indirect approaches - you will find comments at the corresponding moves. (It is not necessarily good to cut at every point where the cutting stone cannot directly be re-caught ;-) )

Another point I would like to suggest is that you (re)start to look for moves at the borderline between your and your opponents moyos. If you play some (more) of them, this will make the games easier for you!]

C[Tenuki by B. I understand that it's playable, but do you have any thoughts on it? Perhaps you'd have played differently? If B had not played Tenuki (i.e. continued with the D14 joseki, would the result be better for B or W?)

MR: F3 is a probe. If W plays D6, B plays hanging connection at D13 and the joseki that follows. If W plays D7, B plays D14 and the corresponding joseki.]
(;W[hq]C[Any thoughts on my response?
MR: I think that it is playable.]

(;B[df]C[I felt that this move was slow, since W D14 doesn't gain much.

MR: I don't think that this move is urgent now. If W cuts at D14, B can play C13. So I would prefer to play Q6.]
;W[fc]C[honte? or slow move?

MR: Most likely, it is sente, as B will finish off the joseki on the left side with D10. If B tenukis, W is happy to launch an attack against the - then heavy - D14 group.]
;B[dj];W[qq]C[Comments on R3?

MR: I would also want to continue in the bottom right corner, as B played tenuki to fix the left side.]
;B[rq];W[pq];B[ro]
(;W[kq]C[MR: I do not think that this is the correct continuation in view of the joseki already played in the bottom right. This way, the white stones are low (H3, L3) and it is easy for black to reduce the moyo.]
;B[pn]
(;W[nc]C[Directional play. Is O17 or R14 better?
MR: I guess it is a matter of taste. Because of the joseki in the upper left, W cannot expect a big area on the top, and it is also not urgent to play here. More important, W should choose a joseki where he does not end up low on the upper side.]
(;B[pf]C[Ambitious play by B.
MR: R14 would be an alternative. As both, B group in the lower right and W group in the upper left, are save, both players can fight here.]
;W[pb]C[too slow?];B[nn]C[MR: Good move as it reduces the white prospects of a moyo on the lower edge. The move is also at the border of both players area of influence.]
(;W[qi]C[good? Bad? Is this the best spot to invade? Or should I just reduce? Or play somewhere else altogether?

MR: Strange move. Locally, R12 is the usual move for attack.]
;B[qk];W[rg]C[Is S14 better?

MR: Very strange shape. Now you see yourself why R12 would have been better. In that case, S14 would be just the shape that you obviously desire.]
;B[qg]C[MR: Strange.];W[rh];B[nd]C[MR: Even more strange not to follow up with S14.]

MR: I guess it is the normal move ... but, of course, one can always think of something else ;-) ... See one variation ...]

is this too slow? would N4 be better?

correct move to live?

(;B[hl]C[MR: The correct forcing move is J7.];W[im]C[Was H8 wrong? this looks good for W]
;B[hm]C[MR: Now B starts to play fancy moves ... as the B stones around F5 are dead, he cannot attack the white stonds around G6.]
;W[jn];B[gm];W[in];B[il];W[jl]C[would L8 be better? I seem to have very few liberties here.

(;W[en];B[lk];W[hj];B[fk];W[hg]C[too slow?

MR: I do not see the strategic goal of your cut at J9 and the moves that followed. It appears to me that you cut just for the sake of cutting ... Strategically, G14 would be a move that tries to build some territory on the top while preventing B territory in the middle.]

As you realize yourself in what follows, the sequence you chose was an overplay, and it does not really matter whether you play L7, R2, M2 or whatever ... 
I think that white should just have started to play normal endgame. There are some large endgame sequences for both sides on the board, so both sides still had a chance to win the game.]
