C[Thank you for reviewing my game, the game was pretty close. I would like to know where, in your opinion, are my mistakes.]
PL[B];B[pp];W[dd];B[dp];W[pd];B[cf];W[di]
(;B[ff]C[The common answer in this situation is to take the corner at C17 (see variation). The double space jump can be played when the white stone is at D17, not D16. The single space jump at E14 can also be played here.]
;W[gd];B[bd];W[cc];B[bi]C[Q: I was a bit confused here. I couldn't decide if this was the correct move. I also concidered H14 because W would like that point, and I considered approaching the white stone d11 at d8 but I though my stones on the upper left weren't stong enough yet to do so.

A: B11 is a good move when F14 is at E14. Here black has weaknesses. So the mistake was made earlier (at F14) not here.]
;W[cg];B[bg];W[df]
(;B[ch]C[Giving atari like this is usually not good because it reinforces the opponent, but here it is playable because of the continuation at D12 and E11.]
;W[dg];B[dh];W[eh];B[ei]C[Good.];W[dj]C[D10 is a big mistake...]

(;B[fi]C[... but B does not take advantage of it! B should cut at E13 (see variation).]
;W[fg]
(;B[fk]C[Here an atari would just cause a shortage of W liberties and not strengthen W, so it can be played now (see variation). If B wants to capture the two white stones, E9 is safer than F9 because the B group on the left is not yet alive.]
;W[dl];B[dn]C[B should still play F12 or G13 first.];W[em];B[en]
C[B must be careful because his group on the left is not yet alive.]
;W[fm];B[gn];W[gm];B[ij]C[J10 is a good point, but the left B group is now very weak.]
;W[im];B[gg]C[G13 is also a good point, but B should first defend the left B group, now that W has escaped with J7.]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[bj]C[Good! B is dead.]
(;B[ci]C[C11 does not save the B group, but B15 does not work either (see variation).]

(;W[cj]C[W is too kind! W A11 would kill (see variation).];B[ah]
C[B lives, but it is bad to live very small and in gote like this.]
;W[fp];B[ep]C[E4 is not good because it gives the good move F6 for W. Black can simply connect at F6.]
;W[fn];B[fo]C[Try at least to see the obvious W answer at G5. You see immediately that F5 cannot be a good move.]
;W[go];B[fq];W[eo]
(;B[do]C[B should play G3 instead (see variation).];W[gq];B[fr]
;W[gr];B[hp]
(;W[hn]C[W should answer at G4 (see variation).];B[gp];W[fo]
;B[hr];W[bn];B[cm]C[If B is going to defend at C3 after this, it is better to defend directly at B4. But B could also play elsewhere; B6 was played on the second line, there are bigger moves on the top and on the right.]
;W[bp]
(;B[cq]C[The problem here is that black B7 would not kill W (see variation).]
;W[bq];B[br];W[bm];B[cl]C[There is no urgency to continue in this area. Black can keep moves such as C8 in reserve as future ko threats.]
;W[bl];B[ek]C[This is not a forcing move since W is alive on the left. B should play elsewhere.]

(;W[ck]C[White need not answer here (see variation). If W really wants to answer locally, simply connecting at D9 is better.]
;B[dk]C[D9 is a bad move since W is alive on the left.];W[iq]
;B[hq];W[ip];B[nc]C[Q: I wasn't sure If I should have approached this stone like this or r14 instead.

A: B must be careful because his center group might be attacked later if white is reinforced at the top. O17 invites a white pincer which may be difficult to handle correctly, so R14 would be simpler.]
;W[aj]C[W should keep A10 as a ko threat for later.];B[ai];W[lc]

(;B[qc]C[Q: Is this a mistake? It doesn't seem to work very well with the influence I have in the center.

A: Correct. It was better to play O15 (see variation).]
(;W[qd]C[W should play Q17 instead (see variation). R16 is played only when W already has a stone at Q10.]
;B[pc];W[ne]C[W should play P16 instead (B must defend at O18).]
;B[md];W[jd]
(;B[qj]C[B can go further (see variation).];W[qh];B[oj];W[nq]

(;B[oq]C[B could take advantage immediately of the W weakness at P16 (see variation).]
;W[np];B[pn];W[nn]C[W has now been strengthened, so B must be careful about potential attacks against the F11 group.]

(;B[rd]C[B must play P16 directly instead of reinforcing W first.]
;W[re];B[rc];W[qf];B[od]C[It is too late for P16 now. W is very happy to defend. Do not play forcing moves in they don't help you and help the opponent.]
;W[oe]
(;B[mc]C[N17 is a bad move. It is not necessary and makes bad shape (empty triangle). B could instead secure the territory on the right then defend his center group (see variation).]
;W[pk];B[qk];W[ol];B[ql];W[pj]
(;B[om]C[B has made profit on the right side, but it is now time to strengthen the center B group to negate the W influence (see variation).]

(;W[qi]C[W could attack directly at L10 (see variation).];B[me]
C[L10 would be better.];W[nm];B[lj]C[M10 is in the good direction, but B is very thin so L10 would be better.]
;W[pm]C[Q7 is bad: B is happy to defend.];B[qm]C[R7 strengthens the side and reduces the risk of W R3.]
;W[on];B[po]C[Now W can no longer play R3.];W[mj]C[N10 is too small.]
;B[li];W[lk];B[fh];W[eg];B[kk];W[ll];B[kl];W[km];B[mi];W[mk]

(;B[ni]C[O11 is gote. B should try to keep the initiave (see variation).]
;W[gf];B[hf];W[ge];B[hg];W[jf]
(;B[kc]C[B should still play J2 sente first. And here M18 is better than L17 gote (see variation).]
;W[jc];B[kb];W[jb];B[ld];W[kd];B[lb];W[ji];B[jh];W[ie]
(;B[kh]C[J2 is bigger (sente). See variation.];W[ik];B[hj];W[jl]
;B[jk]C[B has lost the initiative and gives J2 to W.];W[ir]
;B[or];W[nr];B[ns];W[ms];B[os]C[B must be careful because P1 might not be sente. But actually it is sente in this situation (see variation).]

(;W[lr];B[ja];W[ia];B[ka];W[hb];B[pg]C[Good!];W[oh];B[og]
(;W[qg]C[O13 does not work, but W can simply answer at Q14 (see variations).]

(;B[ng]C[B can even play Q15 directly (see variation).];W[pf]

(;B[be]C[B can play at B17 instead (see variation).];W[bc];B[ac]
;W[ab];B[ad];W[ba];B[cd];W[de];B[dc]C[Nice try, unfortunately it does not work.]
;W[db];B[ec];W[fe];B[he];W[hd];B[pi]C[B is trying to kill the right W group, but this can only work if B plays S11 first.]
;W[ph];B[oi]C[B has gained almost nothing.];W[pl]C[W should play S10 to ensure the life of the right group and gain points.]

(;B[pe]C[Again, B can only hope to kill W by starting with S11. But W lives (see variations). If B had simply played S11 not to kill W but to gain points, B would have won the game.]
;W[qe]
(;B[of]C[S11 is still much bigger. B lost the game here.];W[rj]
;B[rk];W[si]C[W is alive.];B[sg];W[sf]
(;B[rg]C[T9 does not work either (see variation).];W[rh];B[sk]
;W[sj];B[hk];W[il];B[nk]C[A3 is bigger.];W[nl]C[W should play A2 sente instead.]
;B[oo]C[Again A3 is bigger.];W[no];B[aq]C[Finally!];W[ap];B[ar]
;W[lg];B[mg];W[lf];B[bo]C[Nice try but W is alive anyway.];W[co]

C[N14 is a dame (zero points in gote).];B[lh]C[M12 is also worth zero points in gote. P4, K13 and E10 are worth one point in reverse sente, which is equivalent to two points in gote.]

(;W[nf]C[Q14 is worth one point in gote. J13 and P4 are sente, so they are better. See variation for P4.]
;B[jg];W[le]C[P4 still better because it is sente.];B[if];W[kg]
;B[sd];W[se];B[hl]C[E10 and P4 better (reverse sente).];W[ej]
;B[fj];W[op];B[pq];W[gl]C[So W got the 3 sente points E10, P4 and G8. B lost the game again here.]
;B[gk];W[nj];B[ok];W[nh];B[hm];W[in];B[mh];W[tt];B[jr]C[Q: The following sequence seems rediculous. I was attempting to make white play in his territory.

A: If W plays simply, he has nothing to fear and does not have to add an extra move. W had won by several points anyway so could afford to lose one or two extra points.]
;W[ks];B[kr];W[ls];B[lq];W[mr];B[lm];W[ml];B[kn];W[jm];B[jo]
C[If W plays absolutely safe and connects at J5, B has gained nothing (given K5 in exchange for J5).]

(;W[jq]C[J5 or L3 or M6 are all much better than K3. W can ignore K5 but will lose D8 (see variation).]
;B[dm];W[el];B[fl];W[io]C[Q: There it is.

A: no, you gave away one prisonner at K5, so W can in exchange connect at J5. The W mistake is at K3. Without this mistake you would have won nothing.]
;B[kq]C[Q: And this is where I was being really rediculous because there is nothing I can do anymore.

A: yes, but it was already ridiculous before :-)];W[ln];B[lo]
;W[mm];B[jp]C[B loses one point here. W is already alive with two eyes, and B cannot make two eyes.]

(;W[mo]C[W should play O16 instead (see variation).];B[nd]C[This was a nice game. B lost because he was too greedy. He tried to kill the right W group even though he could win simply without killing it. B should also try to improve the yose (endgame): try to play sente or reverse sente moves instead of gote.]
