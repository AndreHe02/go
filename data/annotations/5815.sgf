C[Hello dear reviewer!

I've preceded my questions or comments with "B:".
My plan in this game was to to protect the center or turn the center in territory,
but didn't manage to do so.
I'm playing as White.

TO:
Hi,I am the reviewer, I hope my review will be usefull.];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[qk]C[B: Is Black playing a specific fuseki?

Yes, this is so called "Chinese fuseki". There is a book of it with title "The Chinese Opening: The Sure-Win Strategy" by Kato Masao. It is a great first fuseki for amateur because as black you can always play it, it is territory oriented which keeps it reasonably simple and it provides nice setting for a fight. You might want to check "On your side" by Charles Matthews for quick introduction to it: http://gobase.org/studying/articles/matthews/fuseki/.

I used it a lot myself when I was 10 kyus younger, around 16kyu, but now I don't like it because I don't like to play three first stones on the same side. But I will recommend it as first fuseki to study. I will get back to it later in this review.]
;W[dj]C[TO: Lets observe the symmetry. Upper side is similar but two other black stones are on third  row while white has all his stones on fourth line. That suggests that black is playing more territory oriented. White tries to be fast, black tries to be strong.

cgoban score estimation: W+7.5];B[fc];W[cf]LB[fd:1]C[TO: Here the corner is not that important. White could consider playing '1' to put emphasis on center.]
;B[ic]LB[jp:2][nq:1]C[buitenland [13k\]: B: Maybe a side extension at K4, K3 or an attack at O3 would have been better?
buitenland [13k\]: B: Any tips on how I should play here?

TO: This was good call from black. Corner is not important but this is nice. White can't afford to close the corner.

For the next stone consider symmetry again. Sequence wO3-bQ5-wL3 would make the game again symmetrical but I think black can and should play more agressively here. I don't think '1' is good for white.

Playing K3 or K4 creates a nice situation. After that black bottom right corner is more valuable than white top left corner. This is because white is weaker in bottom than black is in top.
But then white bottom left is more valuable than black top right because J17 and R9 have longer way there than white D10 and K3/4 has to D4. K4 is also one anti-Chinese play. I think that is playable. Stone '2' would also work for your center-oriented strategy.]
;W[po]C[TO: You invade the chinese corner enclosure, and this invasion is the key to the Chinese fuseki. This point is really important but the idea of Chinese fuseki is to make playing this as difficult as possible. Essentially white won't live here so he will get a weak group. By chasing that group black can force white to play inefficient heavy stones while black makes territory on bottom and on upper corner.]
;B[np]C[TO: The most common response.];W[pl]LB[qq:1]TR[ql]C[buitenland [13k\]: B: Would R8 have been better or an other move?

TO: Playing '1' is common. R8 would not have been good as black would just play Q9 and white would have to defend the R8. It is time to run for white, and low stones are not good runners.]
;B[ql];W[pk]LB[pm:1]C[TO: This is extremely agressive. Black '1' is extremely dangerous now.]
;B[pj];W[oj];B[pi];W[oi]LB[ok:1][pm:2]C[TO: This is way too much, wite has to defend or he will crumble. Now his shape has two weak points while black has none.]
;B[fq];W[cn];B[iq]C[TO: Black hurries to grab the bottom territory. This also adds presure to the weak white group on right side and helps to keep the white center under control.]
;W[ph]C[TO: White is playing extremely agressive moves. These can lead to wery complex fights.]
;B[qh];W[pg];B[rh]LB[oh:3][ok:2][pm:1]C[TO: Useless stone, R13 rather. Note how white has now three cuts in his wall.

cgoban score estimation: B+16.5];W[nc]C[TO: This stone has one fundamental flaw. It will have hard time in living in that space and will likely end up as weak running group. And there is another weak running white group nearby. This allow black to make splitter attack against both of these groups at once. He just attack one and builds strength until it lives. Then he uses this strength to attack the other.]
;B[qf]C[TO: Bad call for black, now white can settle his top stone.]
;W[kc]C[TO: Good.];B[qn]LB[pm:1]C[TO:Black misses the key point.]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pn]LB[ld:2][oh:1]C[TO: This exchange was great for white. Now he has only one cut left in the wall. Baically he could capture it using ladder, but the weak group in top would suffer a lot from ladder breaker.]
;B[lq]LB[ie:2][ne:1][jn:3]C[TO: Lest check the symmetry again. Top is almost symmetrical. Black left side is almost complete terrirory while white still has weak points. I think black is over concentrated there and white side is better. In bottom side black has territory and white has a wall. Unfortunatelly the stong bottom side mostly neutralises the white wall so I must say that here black has better result.

If you thin again about the Chinese fuseki, this is pretty typical result. White gets running group while black graps territory from two sides. And to counter that, to prevent this situation, white K4 would have been fairly interesting, don't you think. 

cgoban score estimation: W+36.5

Black is winning. Cgoban counts moyo as territory but there is nothing in the center because the center is open from three place.]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of]C[TO: No more cuts in white shape. Good.]
;B[dr];W[pc];B[qc];W[oc];B[pb];W[je]LB[fo:1]C[buitenland [13k\]: B: My plan was to take control of the center so I leaved C17 unprotected.

TO: That is the only hope white has. He has to get something out from that wall. The '1' is so called junction point and they are usually very important. Junction point is a point that decides which one starts to enlarge his framework so here if white plays '1' he grabs nice center territory and presses black down but if black takes it white is pressed down while black starts to push his territory to center.

cgoban score estimation: W+41.5.
Black has been playing low territory oriented moves, he should do something to this center soon.]
;B[db];W[ge]C[TO: White has closed the center from two direction now, while black has made some small territory moves. Black has been too slow.]
;B[fo]LB[fm:1]C[B: What about F7 to defend/expand my framework or a reduction at K4?

TO: Play '1' to build the center. You need to create huge moyo so that you could still win after black reductions.]

(;W[gp]C[TO: Losing move. White creates a weak group that has to run to safety. Black can now just chase this an grab the game.]
;B[fp];W[hp];B[hq];W[ip];B[jq];W[ko];B[fl]LB[fm:1]C[B: I tried some variations here with F6 and H8...

TO: This goes too far. White can cut it if he is willing to pay the price. Ikken toi is never wrong, so black '1'.]

(;W[gn];B[fn];W[gm];B[fm]TR[gm][gn]C[TO: These two white stones have no purpose.]
;W[fj];B[dl]LB[gr:1]TR[fl][fm][fn][fo][fp][fq]C[buitenland [13k\]: B: I wanted to put pressure or kill this group but I has good base so maybe that was not such a good idea.

TO: Black group is connected to the strong bottom, there is no attack against it. White just has to run for larger territory now. Last few stones have mostly hurt white, compare the variations to this position now.

cgoban score estimation: W+45.5.
Black is ignoring the center too far.];W[cl];B[dk];W[ck];B[gk]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[gq];B[gr];W[eq];B[er];W[mo];B[qp]LB[hk:1]C[TO: This is likely too slow. Now white can again try to grab more center.

cgoban score estimation: W+59.5];B[gj];W[gi]LB[hj:1]C[TO: Bad, white has to choose now which side of this group he wants to take. He cant have both. Take the center by playing '1'.]
;B[ej]LB[hj:1]C[TO: Forget that stone, play '1'.];W[fi];B[hj]

TO: Technically that is not an invasion. Here in Finland we call those as "worms. They sneak in and eat everything.]
;B[mq];W[nn];B[jp]
(;W[jo];B[go]C[TO: When playing like this there will always be weak groups that can't take much presure. White should play passively and fool proof to avoid collapces. And he should be willing for sacrifises. That is why moyo has to be huge, it will take lot of losses on the sides.

cgoban score estimation: W+34.5.];W[ho]LB[hn:1]C[TO: How about '1'?]

TO: So what did we learn? If you check the score estimations you can easily see where the game turned. White shapes crumbled. After making large central framework white was left with weak groups here and there. When black started to apply end game presure on those they fell because white did not recognize the weak points in time. To fix that I can recommend studying tesuji - clever moves that either make or break the shape of groups. You can study these either from tesuji books or by analyzing professional games.

Second weakness was the ability to see the big picture. There were few cases where white could have sealed the conter if he had be willing to give up something from left. Count the territory, try to see where it is large and then ignore your opponens inferior stones and grab the victory.

Here are my suggestions: 1) when on black play the Chinese fuseki, 2) study tesuji and 3) try to count the score during the game.]
