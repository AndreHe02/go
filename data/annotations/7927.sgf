;B[ce];W[ic];B[cj];W[nc];B[qf];W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]SQ[ld]C[Ben: This move is premature.  He should play around m16 (square).]
;B[qn]C[Ben: This seems reasonable.];W[ql];B[qq]C[May be P6?
Ben: In my opinion it doesn't matter, both are joseki.];W[qp]
;B[pq];W[op];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq];W[qo];B[oq]SQ[nq]C[Ben: Typically the play here is at o3 (marked).]
;W[nq]LB[no:3][np:1][mq:2]C[Ben: It seems like black should go o4 now, anything else leaves the impression that p3 is merely an inferior move to o3.  After b1, w2, b3 the position appears slightly favorable to white with perhaps some aji for black.]
;B[nr];W[mq];B[mr];W[lq]C[Ben: Compare this position with one in which black has a stone on o-3 on move 23.]
(;B[fq]C[Ben: Here I would probably have approached from the other side (see variation).]
;W[cn];B[iq]SQ[dr]C[Ben: Here I would play at d2 (marked) and not leave white the option to kick with e3.]
;W[qi]C[Ben: This is a good play by white, which helps to neutralize the aji around his lower right group (eg., 1s6, 2t5, 3o5).]
;B[dr];W[cq];B[cr]SQ[kc][lc][mc][ld]C[Ben: Still early for this kind of play.  Perhaps better would have been to play around the marked area and see what white's plans were..]
;W[br]C[Ben: White should ignore as you did in the upper right, it is still necessary for him to play at o15 or even f17.]
;B[dq]C[Ben: Endgame move.  Removes aji  (i.e., makes it easier for white to deal with a bad ko).]

(;B[gc]SQ[pb][qb][ic][nc]C[Ben: These marked stones hardly form a group, attack them! (see variation)]
;W[rc];B[rd];W[pc];B[rh]C[Yeah, it was error. I did believe he should answer S11 or similar.
Ben: Yes protecting at r16 was of more value than the "i'll monkey jump you" threat at s12.  Hindsight tends to be 20/20.]
;W[qd];B[qe]SQ[re]C[Ben: What about here at s-15 (marked) instead?]
;W[re];B[rf]C[Should i kill R17?
Ben: The move in the game seems fine to me, the ko fight isn't important.]
;W[sd];B[oe]SQ[ne][ri]C[Ben: Perhaps one of these moves? (marked)]

[sk][il]C[Ben: Always ask yourself what is the value of my current move is compared to other potential moves.  I have a hard time even guessing at what the utility of this move is, are you "escaping" with a weak group?  If that's the case is their a better way to do it?  Were you afraid that he might play here and obtain more territory?  Here even a move like h-15 (probably not the best) seems infinitely more valuable than this play.

Let's consider the move h-15(circle).  What does that do?  Well for one it makes an invasion on l-17 more valuable.  Black could probably go here straightaway but then white would run (squares may potentially be white's path of escape, triangles may be blacks) .  Both groups would be weak but white would, if he lived, have a base from which to launch attacks (see my circles) on your leftside territory - h-15 helps to mitigate that possibility.  

Also, if white decided to shore up and defend l-17 then black could go g-10 next, creating a moyo.]
;W[mf];B[nh];W[ri];B[mg];W[lf]C[Ben: Compare this position with the one that resulted had you invaded on move 39.]
;B[hf]C[Ben: Your move here now, though still good, has less of an impact than if you had played here earlier.  The invasion on l-17 has less bite.]
;W[ie]SQ[gj][hj]C[Ben: He still protects (or is aiming to make a small amount of territory) but what he should have done is started chipping away at that monster on the left.  What if you went at one of the marked squares?]
;B[if]C[Ben: Small..];W[he];B[ge];W[ck]SQ[ej]C[Ben: Enough I suppose, but he had more severe options such as e10 (marked).]
;B[dj]C[Ben: You catch up a little here.  Funnily, he's actually helping you to find the right moves (i.e., make a moyo) so never do that.  See, we can learn from our opponent's mistakes also.]
;W[dk]C[Ben: Where he is pushing from is so small, and where your pushing from is huge.]
;B[lg]SQ[kg]C[Is it mistake? Should i move to E9 or E10?
Ben: Yes, I agree these seem better, locally why not l13 (marked) and block him out completely though?]

(;B[ch]C[Ben: You could play b11 here..see variation.];W[bh]
;B[bg];W[ci];B[di];W[bi];B[bf];W[nj]C[Ben: A strong play, he starts to outline a moyo as well as needle his way into your potential.]
(;B[lj]C[Too slow? Can i break white moyo on right side?
Ben: This was a big move for him, and your reply helped his cause.  Lets look at some alternatives.]
;W[mi];B[li];W[ml];B[mj]C[Ben: This is a little "grabby" or in other words, trying to capture stones for the sake of capturing them without looking to the real issue.  Why not just go m-5 or maybe m-7?]

;W[lr];B[jq]C[Ben: The move h-18 is up for grabs, do the "ill monkey jump you" threat when it really counts for something!]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[lp];B[jo]C[Ben: Other plays that are bigger, in no particular order: b1, h-18, j-7, t-5, p-11,k-15.  Also doesnt m-5 accomplish the same thing while possibly saving one point in your own space and removing one from his?]

Ben: Overall there's a lot about your play that I like.  You excercised caution throughhout your game, only to excess.  Most people in your kyu-range tend to be overly-aggressive, then make unfounded invasions, their goal seems to be to win the game by 100 points or more even when their opponent has played principled moves.  I like caution, I like building some strength but then you have to use it.  It's okay to have weak stones and to make deep invasions - if your position warrants it.  If your strong everywhere then invade.  Play thick in order to use it when the time comes (i.e., when it's time to erase large portions of your opponents territory). 

Two example I could cite are some games by Gu Li and Cho U.  The first tends to do this a lot, he play two shimari's and then attacks for the rest of the game (thats a bit of an oversimplification but I do it for emphasis).  On the other hand Cho U will often prevent his opponents from making strength because his strength is in attack.  Indeed he will even prevent his opponent's from making a shimari - on the first moves if they go on the 3-4 he will immediately go on their 5-3 point in lieu of taking the other corner.  It isn't necessarily best but he is playing to his own strengths, you can't attack if your opponent has no weak groups, and he wants to play a game that suits him.  Okay i've rambled on enough, good luck!]
