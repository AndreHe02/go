(;B[ce]C[C15 helps white out a bit. It's not a bad move, though. I've thrown in a variation or two. If black can keep pushing white along and building up fourth line territory he is quite happy.]
;W[bf];B[dj];W[cm]C[C7 is low. I would play D7 because of D4. Star points emphasize the center.]
;B[el]TR[ck][cm][dp]MA[gf][ef][cf][bf]C[E8 seems to be in the wrong direction because C7 was low. E8 has little or no attack cababilities on the stones marked with trinagles. The big move seems to be the white group marked with squares. Keep pushing it along.]
;W[hd]
(;B[gc]C[G17 seems a bit passive. Black is letting white get away with an agressive move where black is stronger. One possibility is to push and cut.]
;W[ge];B[be]C[The corner is not big right now. A move around L17 is bigger.]
;W[de];B[ee];W[df];B[cc]C[When your stones are this loose it is better to play solid. A mve at C16 would protect against the cut, and it would protect against wA15, bA16.]
;W[ai]C[A11 is very small move. whites group is out in the open - no need to link up. Big move for both sides is around L17.]
;B[gh]C[Because white has already played H16, this move is not so threatening. This is why it is more important to take away white's eye space with L17, first, and then press with G12.]
;W[bj]C[Too small.];B[dn];W[cn];B[do];W[co];B[ep];W[dq]C[This series of moves makes white very very solid in the corner. It might have been wise not to eliminate the aji of a black invasion at C3.]

(;B[fn]C[The cut at E5 is not all that dangerous. The variation I gave is more consistent with the previous bold moves. It is one way to play. F6 seem like a retreat from your frontal assault.]
;W[gq]TR[np][pp][qq]C[G3 - good move. Strengthens the corner while keeping black out. It is well supported by whites triangle group]
;B[eq];W[dr];B[er];W[jp]MA[er][eq][ep]C[K4 - Good move. This shows the flexibility of G3 and why the marked black stones are on worthless territory. Black has made a strong wall - but white has made the corner solid - and blacks stones can't make territory because of G3 and K4. Black would have been better of to play K4 himself.]
;B[hp];W[hq];B[ip];W[iq];B[gp]MA[jo]
(;W[lp]C[these move just solidified white and gave black no territory. See variation to see how white could have really made this painful for black.]
;B[jo];W[hk]C[H9 is a bold move, too bold I would say. Since black has strengthened himself so fiercely, now is the time to attack mercilessly - splitting whites stone at H9 from the upper group and thus mounting a splitting attack.]

(;B[jq];W[kp];B[jr]TR[ir]C[K12 is the perfect move.]

(;W[ci]C[E3 was the crucial point.];B[di];W[gg]C[Black is alive - this just throws away a ko threat.]
;B[eg];W[ff];B[on]C[Good move. It is at the balance of the territtories. Expands black and reduces white.]
;W[kr];B[hr]MA[jr][jq]C[H2 not necessary. The marked black stones still had plenty of liberties.]
;W[ph]C[Seems like the wrong direction. A move around O16 could turn the upper side into white territory. Black is too strong on the right side to be able to do much.]

This move is schizophrenic. I wants to attack the marked stones but it doesn't since they can just run away to J11. It also doesn't create any territory. L17 is better.]
