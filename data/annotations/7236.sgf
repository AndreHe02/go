C[The first suppise. I do not know any Josekis but I never got tthat answer before.

Alex: Well, it is a common one. you can learn Josekis very good at: http://www.joseki.com  i like to use that site. you can just look up some frequent sequenzes.]

(;B[ef]C[that is a good move. getting out.];W[bc]

that is true. better would have been b12, f17. see the variations.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ec];B[bb];W[bd]
(;B[db]C[this is a mistake. it's to defensive and it reduces your space and has a bad form. better is e18, see variations (hope i got them more or less right).]

;W[bh];B[jp];W[fq]
(;B[eq]C[e3 ist to aggressive. your corner is very weak. alwasy be aware that a stone on 4-4 is not a guarantee for the corner. here you are only strenghining white. better is an extension to c6. or the defensive but solid d3.]
;W[fp];B[hq];W[co];B[cp];W[dr]
(;B[eh]C[I got the feeling the lower left corner is gone anyway.

Alex: you are right. it looks bad. but to tenuki here makes it worse. at the moment the white stones are not connected nor have support near by. the strategie would have been:
to fight for the corner with e2. that would probably give you the corner. allows the connection to h3, if white don't acts and seperates d2 and f3.]
;W[er]
(;B[bo]C[Alex: d5 or d6 are better because there is the space to get out. to get some influence towards the center and a connection with e12]

;W[lo];B[fl]C[It was to late. Just twoe points, and the group is still dead.]
;W[fk];B[ko];W[or]
(;B[pr]C[Alex: bad move. do not make contact plays as this one! VERY IMPORTANT! if there is some open space around it is better to approach the enemy stone indirect like r2. r2 secures the corner and see variations. 

contact plays are bad, because you leave the enemy much space (here s-line) to operate. i mean you do not have much influence in the open space, because on one side you are blocked by an enemy stone. and your stone is weak as it is next to an enemy stone.]
;W[qp];B[oq];W[po]
(;B[op]C[Alex: to slow. p5 serves the same purpose much better]
;W[qq];B[nq];W[qr];B[nr]C[My secon corner gone.

Alex: yep. and o2 is to slow. q1 is better because it secures q2 and leaves at least a little pressue at r1. and the white stone at p1 can't get out.]
;W[qj];B[qc]C[Now I try to secure at least the last corner.

Alex: this is a bit slow at the moment. r14 or m17 would have been bigger.]

K2 would have been much better.

Alex: yes, indeed.];W[jq]C[He kills twoe stones and get a good aerea below.
That was a bad deal for me.]

(;B[ii]C[Is the wight group on top already living?
I think not.

Alex: it is. it has three potential eyes: m19, l18 and m17/n17. and for l18 and m17/n17 you need for each two moves to destroy  them.see variations]

;W[fb];B[gb];W[fd]
(;B[hb]C[Alex: b15 is better, because it gives you the opportunity to kill the white group, if you can later make to consecutives moves in the corner.]
;W[ba];B[sm]C[I would have thought about that. That are just three points. The left upper corner is much bigger.]

;W[ba];B[ke];W[cb]C[Too smal a thread.

Alex: and you still had with n19 and d10 bigger threats.

this is my last comment. i think the one most effective way to improve you play is to study some josekis. primary aim is not to learn the sequences but to get a feeling for good moves in the corner. do not make at the beginng of the fighting in one corner contact moves as you did in the games.

this was my first review and i hope it is helpful.
