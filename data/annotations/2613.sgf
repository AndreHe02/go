C[[XC\]
Hi!
My name is Xavier COMBELLE.
I'm a 8k from France
I'm the reviewer of this game.
I will do my best.
all my comments will be prefixed by [XC\]
When I draw a variation, I tried to explain simply
the reason why I chosed the both moves.
If you want more explainations mail me at
xavier.combelle@free.fr
My advice to use this comment would be to not explore the variations
during the first read, just try to imagine bet move with my indications

Just few technicals term:
miai seems equivalent:
if tw opoints are miai, if one player play one point,
the next move should be the other point
sente is for a move or a sequence of move which keep the initiative
gote is for a move or a sequence of move which lose the initiative]

(;W[qf]LB[qo:A]C[I would prefer play A ( see variation for explaination) but this move can't be considered as bad]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[pj]LB[nd:A]C[[XC\] usually the black move use to play A, because the corner is not live yet,
So play near A should be important in the future.
But now, the urgent point is to make the two stones alive,
so the following white move is good];W[qi];B[pm]
(;W[qo]LB[nd:C][qo:A][mq:B]C[[XC\]
R5 look like is not such a big point.
the fact is that A and B are miai for the corner life.
so white is free to do what he want.
Previously I said that a move near C is big
look on variations to see possibilities];B[ne]
(;W[fc]LB[fc:B][ic:A][lc:C]C[[XC\] here is I think the biggest strategic mistake.
when you invade, the purpose is to be alive as fast as you can.
For this purpose, you should play far from your opponent strength.
so a move like A seems far more interesting.
A seems to be the best point because it leave two extensions B and C which are miai
see variations.
Generally speaking playing far from strength ( yours or your opponent's)
is a very useful principle.];B[hc];W[fe];B[he];W[fg];B[dh];W[hg]

[ss]C[BloodLettr [20k\]: good game
mvk20 [20k\]: Wow. That was close.
BloodLettr [20k\]: very ;) excellent game

[XC\] As the both player said, it was a good game 
the mean reason may be there is a little gap between the both players (only 3.5 points)
I hope my comments will help them to make it better])

(;W[qo]LB[dd:A][pq:B]C[[XC\] now the situation is pretty simetric.
The only difference is a is on the fourth line and B is on the third line
so the upper left corner is more oppen ( i's easier to live under a fourth line's stone
than a second line one.
so the situation of back seems to be just a little bit better.
It's enough to win]))
