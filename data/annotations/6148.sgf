AB[pd][dp]C[Hi, comments and variations are dispersed.

I think that you both played well, but I think W got most of the big points. The top two things that I feel you should work on are:

- Tenuki more. You seemed to respond a lot to W's moves, a lot of times unnecessarily. Before playing any move, you should ask yourself how much damage you would take in that area if you just played somewhere else. I think the answer will be 'very little' more often than you think.

- Improve technical play. I felt like you just 'missed' a lot of things that someone of your level should be seeing. Practicing go problems will definitely help in improving your intuition.

Hope this review helps.

Good luck,
John];W[pp];B[dc]C[Completely standard.

I wasn't sure about this.  Because my two handicap
stones are both on hoshi spots, should I have made my
first move on D16?  Or would it have been better
9regardless of the handicap) to kakari on his Q4 stone?];W[cn]
;B[gq]C[Not too far. I like a pincer better though, since it would work well with your D17 stone.
----
Hmm...is this too far of an extension right now?];W[dl];B[ci]
C[Now this pincer isn't really severe, as the white stones have an easy time getting comfortable.]

(;B[bg]C[Helps W more than B I think.];W[bf];B[cg]C[This is bad shape. Stay loose.]

have first responded due to the really bad situation that
follows?];W[bq];B[cq];W[br];B[cr];W[cs];B[ds];W[bs];B[er]C[The last many moves have all been too small for this stage of the game.]
;W[do];B[cp];W[eo];B[ep];W[fp];B[fq];W[fo]C[Sure, see the variations. Also, many chances to tenuki in there.. you guys aren't really fighting over much.
----
Was there a less submissive, but still a safe way for me to
prevent so much loss?];B[nq]C[I would approach from other side. Your low and solid E3 group makes territory-making on the bottom hard.]

This doesnt seem to be the best move.  I thought M15 or
M16 would been a lot more effective.];B[gb];W[hb];B[le];W[if]
;B[lg]C[Good.];W[pb];B[qc];W[ng]
(;B[li]C[This may be too much jumping.];W[ph]
(;B[qh]C[Tough spot here... I think this is fine. Risky would be the push and cut, which I might have been tempted to play myself.

Upper right still big and unsettled.

Thiss seemed small in retrospect to B15 or B16 and I
probably could have lived, at the cost of a few more
points lost.  Was this move really more important, or less
urgent?];W[qb]C[Yep, huge.];B[rb];W[bc];B[cb];W[bb]

Expand with something like H6, or take sente w/ R3, or reduce with something like Q8.]

least I think I did).  Would s17 have been better?];W[ra];B[rc]

Too submissive?];W[ll];B[kl];W[lm];B[ln];W[km];B[kn]C[You guys need to stop fighting over non-existant territory. Time for endgame stuff like P1 or T11.

connected regardless of his next move here.];W[on];B[nm]C[This was unneccesary, wasn't it, because if he cut, I'd
atari, and then he couldn't connect to the atarid stone
before connecting out, right?];W[mh];B[lh];W[jg];B[jh];W[lf]
C[I don't think so. You should have played something other than K12.
