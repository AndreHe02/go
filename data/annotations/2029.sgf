C[Bjoern: Some general hints and advice plus pointing out a few not too obvious mistakes would be nice.   After move 51 it looks to me, as if black should be ahead quite a bit. If so, how can I improve my beginning moves without learning Josekis? (From several Dan level players I got the advice, that learning Josekis can/should wait until around the Dan level.) If not, how can I improve my reading of situations?
Thanks in advance for any comments...];B[pd];W[dp];B[dd];W[pq]
;B[qo];W[mp];B[pl];W[cf];B[fc];W[di]LB[jj:A]C[Now a move at "A" looks very nice. It has influence on all sides.
This stone will help you both invade white sides, and protect yours
I think it`s a proverb which said "If position is simetrical play in center."]
;B[hq];W[fq];B[kq];W[mq];B[cn]SQ[hq][kq]C[This is not a very good ideea, you already have a weak group in bottom side. White could take initiative now. Please see var.]

(;W[cp];B[ck];W[go];B[eo]LB[bi:1][ek:2][fp:A]SQ[hq][kq]C[This move will help white to become stronger. He can connect his stones at "A".
I think the marked group need reinforcement not this one.
The left side group have no problems at this stage. You could play 1 or to 2 if white attack]
;W[ep];B[do];W[ko];B[io]C[I don`t think this move realy works. See var.]

(;W[oc];B[qb];W[pe]C[I think is better for black not capture yet]

(;B[pa];W[qf];B[re];W[rf]LB[oe:B][pf:A]C[here you can give atari at "A" or "B" first to create two white groups, both of them weak]

(;B[rd];W[od];B[pb];W[pf];B[id]LB[oe:A]TR[qi]SQ[lc]C[This is too slow, and only one purpose: defense.You must not worry about m3. that stone could be linked with a move like j4, j3 or o2, or even run into the center.There is no danger yet.
I think R11 is extremly big . Why?  Well first of all you build teritory.
And second, is a preparatory move to cut at "A" since the ladder is favorable for you and split white again in two weak groups]
;W[qj]SQ[pl][qo]C[Now white make an perfect extension while attacking your marked group]
;B[qq];W[qr];B[rq];W[rr];B[pp];W[oq];B[op]TR[cd][bi]C[this is too small for this stage of the game. Both white and black groups are safe.
Better to play c16 now, aiming b11 next.];W[np];B[rl];W[oj]
;B[ek];W[fi];B[gk];W[nl]
(;B[om]TR[om]SQ[cf][di][fi]C[Let me ask you a question. What is P7 doing?
Defend 2-3 points of teritory?
The marked white stones are weak and asking to be attacked :)
I don`t think you could kill them, but you can take a lot of profit while attacking.
Now an advice: when your opponent make a move try to see if is any threat in that move, and if you see another place on the table where you can take more points go there, don`t respond just because white moved there.  See the variation please.]

I think with this atempt you lose the game, after this moves you made your upper side teritory easy to invade]

Let him live small and build your teritory at the same time. That will be enough to win, especially when you are in the lead.
Whenever you have enough time in the game try to count both black and white points, to se who is ahead. If you are ahead then just play safe. Your opponent should take the risks not you.
And of course play many games to improve your fighting skills.
I`ll advice you also to read a book - Attack&Defense, if you find it.
You played well except that useless attack])
