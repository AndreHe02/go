C[Dear reviewer,
thanks for spending time on my game.
I play black in this game.
I welcome any comments, but I have a specific question :
It looks like I had several attacking opportunities (weak white groups), but was unable to make the most of them.
Could you please give me a piece of advise on attacking tactics?
Thanks a lot.
Marc.



[lf\] Hello, all my comments will be prepended with [lf\]
Overall, I would say that you show a good sense on what to attack, but your timing could be better. Also, you should follow your strategy. In several occasions, I have seen that you changed your mind in the middle of an attack, or that you allowed your oponent to recover. The game is good, by several aspects, and with a little more focus and rigorous thinking, you'll easily get a few kyus higher. 

If you have any question or comment, please don't hesitate to contact me.]
;B[pd];W[cq];B[pq];W[cc];B[ep]LB[pk:C][po:B][qo:A]C[[lf\] I am not too familia with this approach. It feels a little close to the corner stone, which doesn't "need" immediate attention. I owuld rather complete an enclosure at "A" or "B" or play a high chinese fuseki "C", hich would set the game as influence vs. territory (white has a very territorial start, and the influence is all offered to black).]
;W[cn];B[jp];W[po]
(;B[np]LB[pl:B][pm:A]C[[lf\] Here I would pincer the white stone at "A" or "B". The sequences shown, which is likely, gives territory to black. This option leaves a lot of room for white to extend]
;W[qq];B[qr];W[qp];B[or];W[ql]LB[qk:A]TR[jp]C[[lf\] here white was alittle conservative. Usually, the extension is at "A". On the other hand, black would now prefer the marked stone to be further away from the bottom right group.]

(;B[ed]LB[fd:A]C[[lf\] same remark as previously. A feels better.]
;W[nc];B[ce];W[dd];B[de];W[ec];B[fc];W[fd];B[ee];W[fb];B[gc]
;W[eb];B[ge]C[[lf\] this is very good of black. Now you don't have a weak group to worry about. White has a very little gain]
;W[er];B[lc]C[[lf\] yes, very very much. This is excellent. The presure on the white stone is immense.]
;W[ne];B[pf];W[kd];B[oc];W[nb];B[kc]LB[gb:A]C[[lf\] One thing to consider is that the potential for gain for black is small. There is no territory at the top, and the move at "A" is not sente. However, the good side is that white is nowhere near alive or stable. The meaning of these moves is to keep white unstable.]
;W[ld];B[md];W[nd];B[mc];W[me];B[jc];W[le]
(;B[cl]TR[nb][nc][kd][ld][nd][le][me][ne]C[[lf\] this is off-topic. The marked white group is weak. If you want to attack, this is the target. There is a potential for a gain for black (on the right side) while attacking white. Pushing the white (heavy) stones towards the strong black group is very interesting here. See variation.]
;W[dj];B[el];W[cg];B[qj];W[ol];B[oj]C[[lf\] getting back on topic. This is attacking the weak white stones by cutting their contact to the nearest help or supporting stones.]
;W[lp];B[lj]C[[lf\] good idea. It's good to attack from far away. The goal being not to kill, but to gain advantage from this.]

(;B[bj]TR[eg][gh][ii][gj][hl]C[[lf\] off topic! White is in deep trouble now. I'm not sure that he could live. You could reinforce black in the marked area then go after the left-hand side white stones.]
;W[ci];B[dh];W[ch];B[bi];W[bh];B[bf];W[fj]C[[lf\] here the risk of white connecting is weak group together is strong.]
;B[lg];W[oa];B[sd];W[mb];B[ek];W[ej];B[gl]C[[lf\] I'm not sure about the direction. Black gains nothing here in territory, as the bottom left side is secured by white. You have to wonder where the potential areas for black territory are now. I see a modest upper center, a larger lower area and nothing else.]

(;B[rr]C[[lf\] this is off-topic. If white connects both groups, the attack on the right side is useless. You separated the groups and you now offer them a chance to connect. You're playig against your own strategy]

;W[lf];B[lb];W[ma]TR[fb]C[[lf\] because of the marked stone, this exchange is not vey profitable. maybe there are more points to be gathered in the lower left corner. See variation]
