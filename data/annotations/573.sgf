;B[dj]LB[cj:A]C[When playing a splitting move it's usually played low (at A).
The reason is that it will be easier to settle the stone.];W[cl]
;B[fq]LB[cf:A]TR[dj][fq]C[Black is too busy: both marked stones are weak and will need attention.
The normal move would have been at A to settle the group on the left.]
;W[hq]LB[dq:A]TR[fq]C[Wrong, better is white A to prevent black's next move
and thus to keep the marked stone weak.];B[cq]C[Good.];W[cp]
C[Wrong side: the bottom has more potential.];B[dq];W[ep];B[fr]
;W[go];B[dl]LB[cf:A]C[Black is moving towards white's thickness, normal would be A.]
;W[ck];B[fp];W[fo]LB[gp:A]C[A bad exchange since it removed other options like A.
It strengthened white on the outside as well (an inside
move versus an outside move).];B[fl]LB[fj:A]TR[dl]C[Better A since the marked stone is a small loss when it's cut off
considering white's strength locally.];W[dk];B[ek];W[dm]LB[ej:A]
C[Too passive, better cut with A.];B[el]LB[ej:A]C[Small, better to prevent the cut with A.]
;W[ej];B[di];W[fj]C[Now black has two weak groups inside a white sea of stones.
White is clearly better here.];B[bj]LB[cm:A][gk:B]C[Would be a good move when it would treaten to cut at A.
But in this case moving out the marked stones (with B)
is more urgent.];W[gk]TR[ek][dl][el][fl]C[Good, virtually capturing black's marked stones.]

To attack white could play D.];B[bo];W[co]LB[bp:A]C[A is much bigger.]
;B[bp];W[do]C[Not necessary.];B[cf]C[Good.];W[ce];B[df];W[ee]
LB[fd:A]C[Bad shape leaving too many weaknesses at the top.
Better shape is A.];B[cc];W[be];B[fc]LB[dc:A][de:B][cd:C][ed:D]
C[Better just play A to make this stone alive. Black A
would treaten B, C, D to cut next.];W[fd];B[gc];W[ef];B[eg]

C[Strengthens white. Better just A to prepare the cut at B.]
;W[pf];B[nd];W[qi];B[rj]C[Good.];W[ri];B[qk]LB[qj:A]C[Better is A since it takes a liberty from the white stones.]
;W[oi];B[gd];W[ge];B[he]LB[nk:A][rf:B]C[Too soon, better to play A or B.]
;W[ie];B[hf];W[id]LB[jc:A]TR[he][hf]C[In this position black wants to play A (big and shape)
but the marked stones are too weak. This is the reason
that the cut was too soon.];B[if];W[je];B[gg];W[fh];B[ff];W[cb]
;B[dc]LB[bb:A]C[Wrong, better at A.];W[bc];B[bb]LB[bd:A]C[Better technique locally is A. The move
played strengthens white.];W[ab];B[ba];W[ca];B[bd];W[aa];B[cd]

upper-left together are too much.];B[hb];W[ib];B[gb];W[fe];B[gf]
