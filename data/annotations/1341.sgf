ems like I'm (black) already in trouble.  w has made territory on right,
while b hasn't improved his position much.  top right b stones not doing
much more than the original handicap stone there.  plus, the Q10 b stone
ripe for being attacked.

** It is true that Q10 is not working so effectively after white has become
strong above. Black has suffered a slight loss, but I wouldn't go so far as
saying that he "is in trouble".];B[jp]LB[dj:A][gd:B]C[** (a) or (b) seems more natural with black's formation at the
top right.];W[cf];B[dj];W[fc]C[because i didn't like what happened in upper right i
try a different response
here];B[ce];W[df];B[ee]TR[cf][df]C[** Black's way of playing here is interesting, although I haven't seen
it anywhere before (the moves are described in Ishida's joseki
dictionary with F17 at F18). Black has made the marked stones
heavy while avoiding to strengthen any of the white groups.]
;W[dh];B[gd]TR[cc]LB[ge:A][id:B]C[** Again pushing on a weak stone does not seem right (same
problem as on the right). White has two weak groups but can
go in at C17. Jump to (a) or go for a pincer around (b).];W[gc]

;W[ej];B[eb]LB[ek:A]C[** (a) is quite big!];W[ec];B[dc]C[** Secures the corner, at least.]
;W[fb];B[db]LB[kc:A]C[** How about (a)? Black will capture E18 in gote.]
;W[kc];B[ch]LB[ek:A]C[those b stones in
upper right becoming more weak and not doing much for me.

** Again black could play (a) first. It is sente. It is true that
the black group on the right has no base, but it's not that
weak yet.];W[ef];B[de];W[gf];B[ge];W[ek]C[** Now black's formation becomes flat.]
;B[dk];W[el];B[dl];W[em];B[dn];W[gp]TR[pj][jp]C[** White is thick now, so the natural thing would be to
secure one of the two lonely black stones.];B[ld]C[** Not bad, it secures the black group and aims to enclose
 white's. But the first priority here has to be securing black's
stones within white's framwork. Note also that M16 doesn't
build up any territory.];W[lp]C[** Black is losing now.];B[jn]

up with C2, maybe it's ok). How about (a) or (b)?];W[dr];B[fq]
