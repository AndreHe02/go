C[Hello,

I am a 21st kyu player (as measured by KGS) who would like some advice on his game.  This game goes fairly well, though I do make one huge blunder (move 177).  I would most likely have won if I didn't make it.  Either way, I'm mostly looking for advice on the beginning of the game, move 23 for instance is bad, but I'm still not sure where to move in on white's territory there. I'm also interested in how to effectively build/use moyo.  I think I'm generally too conservative in pushing toward the center. Granted, that way I make less mistakes, but I'd like to improve. I'll put additional comments on specific moves.  Thank you very much for taking a look at this game.

David

A 3-3 joseki is time-honored and solid.  But now in modern times some feel it gives too little influence.  A more common way to achieve control of the corner would be to play 3 at q17 and 5 at R15.]
;W[jp];B[jd];W[pj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
After 8 moves both sides have stakd out just as much territory. Being black, with sente, you should have aimed for more.]
;B[cn]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This helps!];W[dn];B[dm];W[en];B[bp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Calm and methodical.  Very good.];W[co];B[bn];W[bo];B[ao]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This exchange has been better for black than for white.];W[em]
;B[dl];W[cp];B[bq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Black can still be satisfied with this.];W[cr];B[qi]TR[mp][nq]
[mq][lq][pn][pm][qn][qm][ph]C[As I mentioned in the beginning, this move was a mistake.  I've been testing out the [4,4\]/[3,3\] opening as a way to take one corner solidly so that I can be a little more aggressive.  In this case I moved in so close because I figured the corner was fairly sturdy.  However, I didn't think of a pincer.  How would you attack white's area on the bottom?  Or would you?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Absolutely!  I would attack, and perhaps both earlier and harder than you did in this game.  Divide and conquer.  I've marked some spots I think all are better for 23.]
;W[qf];B[pi]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
The iron pillar...  Good!];W[qj];B[ri]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Waste of a perfectly good stone.  Too early to be playing on the second line.  Too small.  Too gote.]
;W[oi];B[oh];W[ni];B[nh];W[pg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
From here and quite a few moves forward you're letting white have his way with you way too much.]
;B[ph];W[qd];B[pd];W[pe];B[rd]TR[od]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Drive him towards the edge.  P16 is better.];W[od];B[pc];W[qe]
;B[of]TR[oe]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Never threathen to cut.  Just cut!];W[oc];B[oe];W[ob];B[sf]
TR[hp][mp][np][nq][qn][pn][pm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Clever.  But this local fight can wait.  Time to think about the big picture.  Time to break up that big white framework.]
;W[qb];B[rc];W[kc];B[jc];W[kd]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Again you're too willing to let white keep sente, guide the flow of play and gnaw away at your mojo.]
;B[jb]TR[md][kb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Nope.  Second line.  Too early.  Small.  Gote.  If you insist on this local fight, how about N16,  Or even L18.]
;W[kb];B[ke];W[le];B[kf];W[me];B[og];W[mi];B[ne];W[nd];B[rb]
TR[pb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Q18 is better.
But now this fight is contained.  Time to play elsewhere and let this wait.]
;W[pb];B[qn];W[rj];B[rp]TR[np][nq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
This works better when R6 has friendly support in the back.  O3 and O4 are far better here.]
;W[qp];B[qo];W[rq];B[so];W[rm];B[qm];W[ql];B[sm]TR[om]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Here you're in trouble and white is strong.  You should run for the centre.]
;W[rl];B[rn];W[pm]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
...now white won't let you...];B[mp]C[Here I give up on my group to the right and decide that I can at least use it to help out the N4 stone.  I get N4 to safety, but still lose the S6 group.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
You should not have looked so much at the local fight there, but thought about survival earlier.]
;W[pn];B[kq];W[nq];B[mq]TR[jq]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Personally I like K3 better here.];W[nr];B[mr];W[jr];B[jq];W[iq]
;B[kr]TR[kp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Move out, move towards the centre.];W[ir];B[np]TR[kp]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
O3 is safe and proably cannot be killed.  Black needs two eyes or a way out.]
;W[op];B[oo]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Pointless.  Could have made sense when there were only one or two other black stones here.  Never help your opponent make his groups stronger.]
;W[po];B[nn];W[mn];B[ln];W[mm];B[lm];W[mo];B[lo];W[no];B[fk]
TR[hh][hi][ih][ii]MA[eo][ip][oj][or]C[This is one if the points on which I'm looking for advice.  Everything is for the moment settled and I'm looking to build moyo.  I chose F9 because it turns the corner around white's stones, but it also leaves a big gap where white later invades.  Would it be better to play in that gap, or is that overplaying it?  Or is there a better place to play?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Tengen or close to Tengen is always a god move.  But!  I think the edges around D16 are unsettled and easy points for invation for white.  X marks a few spots that are or can be of interest for black.  A couple with a little preparation, a couple right away.]
;W[el];B[ek];W[hk];B[gl]C[Here I didn't want him cornering off a big group and causing problems for my M5 group.  It did allow him to invade, however.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
You should always try and secure as much as possible of the edge. A go proverb says there are no territory in the centre.  Besides, the upper left quadrant is too big an too loosely surrounded to be considered a black mojo.
Snaking into white's claim with G8 is good.];W[hm];B[jl];W[hl]
;B[jj];W[jh];B[ii];W[hh];B[hi];W[gi];B[ih];W[ig];B[hg]TR[gh]
C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Wrong.  G12 would let you escape after G10.];W[gh];B[jg];W[kh]
;B[if]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
But it turned out well!];W[kp];B[lp];W[kl];B[km];W[jm];B[kk]
;W[ll];B[ml]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Double atari.  Sneaky and well played!];W[nm];B[lk]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
At this point black is solidly ahead.];W[gj];B[li];W[lh];B[mh]
;W[mk]C[This was an odd move for white];B[nk];W[nl];B[mj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I agree. White did a few confusing moves there.];W[ok];B[nj]
TR[oj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Uh-oh.  P10 would have captured the three white stones and killed them in a snap-back.  When you see a good move, look for a better one.]
;W[oj];B[cc]TR[cg][fc][cf][gm][ip][jn][or][ka][lf]C[Is this good here?

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
C17 is very solid and protective.  But it's too thick, very much gote and overprotective.  I've marked a few moves I'd consider instead of C17.  Those putting pressure on white would be my choice.]
;W[dh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
C17 was gote.  White takes sente.];B[eg]TR[or][ka][gn][gm][jn]
[im][ip]C[If there is a better way to respond to this invasion I'd like to know, though I do kill it successfully.  If here were more conservative in invading I'd have had bigger problems.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Attack is the best defense.  That single stone need not take much territory from you.  I would have looked for a way to barge into white's claim somewhere.  I've marked a few examples.]
;W[eh];B[dg];W[bh];B[bj]TR[ch]C[I think B10 is too defensive.  I would have cut.]
;W[be];B[cg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Again, why not cut.....];W[ch];B[bg];W[fg];B[ff];W[gf];B[gg]
;W[ef];B[fh];W[fi]TR[fg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I would connect now.  The future cut at E11 makes that very interesting.]
;B[ee];W[fg];B[df];W[jn];B[fh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Good!];W[gm];B[ei];W[di];B[ej];W[fg];B[gk];W[hj];B[fh]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
From here on the situation should stabilise.  You're ahead with 15-20 moku.  It should be possible to calm things down, play conservatively from here on and secure the win.]
;W[ra];B[fg]C[Here I identify the move he makes as a non-threat because of my T14 stone, I just bungle up the response.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
F13 is good.  You should ignore S19.  The surprise is that white keeps pushing on in that corner.]
;W[sb]
(;B[sc]C[This was the fatal move, and I try in vain for a few moves to save the group... probably a bad idea.  Anyway, it's corrected here as a variation.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
You are right.  T15 would be the way to live.  And keepthe white prisoners dead.]
;W[re];B[sa];W[se];B[qa]C[I think that might be enough liberties to kill his group, but it's not.]
;W[pa]
(;B[rf]C[Also useless, I was moving without thinking fully.  He really thought before playing S13, thinking it was some trick.  It's still not gonna work, as shown in the variation.]
;W[rg];B[pf];W[sg]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Sad.  But you see where you went wrong.];B[qg];W[ra];B[rf];W[sb]
;B[si];W[sd];B[sj]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Now white leads with about 10 moku.  Time for daring and offensive play.  T10 is small.]
;W[sk];B[mf];W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[mg];W[kj];B[ki];W[je];B[jf]
;W[ie];B[he];W[ja];B[ib];W[ld];B[ia];W[br];B[cq]C[Oops, another mistake.  Should have begun connecting here.  It would have taken a bit of reading to know it though...

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
And worse is that again you've let white take sente and completely run you around for several moves.

The same goes for the entire exchange until your next comment. You're letting white keep sente, and run around doing the moves he tells you to.
You should look for ways to ignore him, play ataris or threats. Cut.  Expand.  Invade.  You're behind and need to grow.  And white isn't THAT solid yet.]

;W[ec];B[dc]TR[fb]C[I don't think I had to make this move, since I was so well connected.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Very true.  F18 would achieve more.];W[ea];B[fb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
There you go!];W[fc];B[gb];W[gd];B[gc]TR[eb]C[[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
I would have cut at E18.];W[hd];B[id];W[hc];B[hb];W[fl];B[bj]
C[This could have waited for another threat.

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
Absolutely!  As you have one liberty at F10 there is nothing to fear, even if white should try B7.]

[Bjørn Ingmar Berg\]
My impression is that you're strong enough to beat white.  You don't because of simple oversights, and a somewhat meek attitude.

Sente is important!  Take it, keep it, retake it.
Even a bad attack can be a good defence.  Cut more, split more, invade and make snakes.  A bit more Ghengis Khan, and a bit less Gandhi and you'll wipe the board with white.
Reading out situations better will help of course, as well as thinking "Perhaps this is a situation I should read out!"

This has been a fun game to comment.
Good luck with your go!])
