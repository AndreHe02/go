C[Game commented by Niall ("NM")
at the request of White.

Dear reviewer, I'd be interested in comments on the fuseki, because I had no clue during the game, especially :
- how to respond to the approach move in the lower left
- how to cope with the sanrensei moyo

NM: I'll try];B[pd];W[cq];B[pp];W[cc];B[dp];W[dq]C[NM: good]
;B[cp]C[First question : what to play ?]
(;W[bp]C[NM: safe but small.];B[eq];W[ep];B[fp];W[eo];B[fo]
C[NM: you should throw in the cut at  F3 first.];W[co];B[en]
;W[do];B[pj];W[nq]C[NM: This is OK< but my preference
would be L3.];B[lq]C[NM: Good!];W[qq]C[NM; Not good. You should jump to
O5. This is too easy to shut in,
as B does.];B[qp];W[pq];B[op];W[nr];B[mo];W[nc];B[kd]C[NM: should be tighter: M17 or O16
- or even M16.];W[ne]C[NM: excellent];B[pf];W[pb]C[NM: this is joseki, but I'd be tempted
to go O13];B[qc];W[kb];B[ng]C[From here on, I dont know how to play for the win. I am under the impression that the black moyo is already much too large.

NM: it's not that big. Play O13 and
it only looks like about 40 points -  and you have at least 30. But yes, B is
slightly ahead in my view.];W[ic]C[NM: quite big, but it falls between
two stools. Either L17, to remove all
the aji of the weak group, or D18 to
start making real territory, would in
my view be better.];B[df]C[NM; Excellent];W[di]C[NM; Just right]
;B[dd];W[dc];B[fd];W[ec]C[NM; Big, but I'd be tempted to attack
at J14 or G12.];B[gf];W[if];B[dk];W[ii]C[NM; This is attractive, because it
gives you a way into the L moyo;
but I thin k it just leaves too much
weakness. I would play F13 or G11];B[gi];W[fj]C[NM; Inconsistent with your last move -
should be something like E8, E9, or G12];B[ei];W[ej];B[dj];W[ci]
;B[fi];W[fl]C[NM; This is a fight you don't need.
But you come out ofit  quite well.];B[bj];W[bi];B[bl];W[bf]
;B[el]C[NM: this should be E7.];W[gj];B[bg];W[cg];B[cf];W[ag]
;B[be];W[bh];B[hj]C[KenHark [21k\]: Black D12?];W[hk];B[hi]
;W[fm];B[fn];W[em];B[dm];W[dn];B[cm];W[hm];B[io];W[ek];B[bn]
;W[dl];B[cl];W[ik];B[ij];W[rq]C[NM: I think there are still very
big moves round the fight. If you  reinforce your C11 group - e.g. by playing D12 or D13, B E14, W E13 -
the threat of the ko starting with C10
becomes very major, and B nearly has
to answer.];B[rp];W[lf]C[NM: It's not big enough just to take
that one stone.];B[kf];W[kg]C[NM: should be M13, marching out into
the B moyo.];B[jg];W[jf];B[ih];W[ji];B[jj];W[jh];B[kh];W[ig]
;B[ki];W[hh];B[lg];W[ke];B[lj]C[NM; so you've taken the stone, at the
cost of reinforcing B's moyo.];W[kl];B[ml];W[cj];B[ck];W[aj]
;B[ak];W[bk];B[oq];W[or];B[bj];W[sp]C[I thought that after a11, I would never win the ko, so I decided to give it up and try something desperate. No great fighting spirit this time :o(]
;B[ai];W[ro];B[dh]C[Here I gave up.

NM: Well, I wouldn't quite yet.  There's still a lot of agi in the position - look at the variation -  and you have sente to completely  destroy the B moyo with Q7.
However, B is in the lead.];W[dg];B[eg];W[ef];B[de]C[NM: If B plays E15 you link under with
C15.];W[fg];B[eh];W[ed];B[ee];W[ff]C[NM: B has to answer F15
(see variation for why) and W gets a
reasonable attack.]

(;W[ep]C[I wonder wether this one is better, to prevent black from developping influence toward the right side

NM: Yes. You prevent his 2 stones
from working together with his
hoshi points.]))
