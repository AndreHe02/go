C[Hello, I will be your reviewer today.

Some general comments: 

For black : you should try very hard to avoid being shut in, it should almost give you physical pain to have to live in gote, or to play a second line move to secure a group. 

For white : In the begining, there are two kind of moves : urgent and big. Urgent is usually "bigger" than big, more important. For instance, in the game, you played the huge move of q10, but he got his h3 stone out and living, which gave him the advantage. If you don't like to fight, you can also play more territorially oriented joseki, for instance f5 at c3. 
Later in the game, when your group was alive, there was another kind of mistake : helping your opponent. when your group is alive, moves such as g7 or j4 only help your opponent have a stronger position (i.e you play moves inside, he plays moves outside.]
