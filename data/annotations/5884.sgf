C[Hello, Mr. Reviewer, and welcome to my game against Gnugo. I've been playing against computer programs like this for a while now, and I must say, they are a challenge. I've gotten continually better by playing GnuGo and with the help of reviewers like yourself, to which I would like to thank you.

In this game, I had a one stone handicap against white. x) and I milked that baby to my whole advantage. Still, while I have occasionally beaten gnugo by 2, maybe 3 points before, I have yet to beat her with komi, and this is no exception. My short term goal is to accomplish this, which is no easy task, believe me!

I have plenty of questions, and I will comment this game in order to help you with the review, so without further ado, let us begin.]
;B[pp]C[This move is a tradition of mine. :)

TH: I will start comments with TH:];W[dd]C[typical.];B[dp];W[qd]
;B[cf]C[Usually, when I am aiming to win, I go for a more secure approach, like F4, but this time I really wanted to put the pressure on white, and there's nothing wrong with this move, so I went for it.]
;W[fc]C[I've wondered, Is B16 a better move? Could you explain why or why not?]
;B[ef]LB[bd:A][dj:B]C[TH:  A or B are more common followups.  This is an attempt to start a moyo game perhaps]
;W[ic];B[dk]LB[pj:A]C[Building up thickness along the left side. looks pretty good.

TH:  A would be another way to build a large structure];W[nq]
LB[qn:A]C[Typical.

TH: I would prefer w move at A.  w needs to counter the moyo game by taking a lot of territory and invading]

(;B[no]LB[kp:C][lp:D][kq:B][lq:A]C[Here we get to the meat of things: when white invaded with O3, I toyed with the idea of pincering, but was unsure of the complications that would arise. I settled however, to start building up a thick right side instead. Is that a good plan, or is there a better strategy?

TH: black should pincer and attempt to consolidate the moyo by atrtacking]
;W[lp]C[Typical.]
(;B[pj]
(;W[od]C[TH: see thread for w];B[hq]C[Now that i'm thinking about it, maybe Q14 would have been a better move? It certainly would have been interesting, but I guess I didn't want white to extend to H4. Variations?

TH:  lower right is urgent.  P16 and Q14 are big moves.  Do urgent moves first]

(;W[qn]LB[ql:G][pn:B][qo:A][jq:F][oq:D][or:C][pr:E]TR[no]C[Ouch.

TH: the marked stone doesnt put much pressure on the bottom group and doesnt secure the right side at all.  Perhaps white should have just played E and F]

(;B[ql]C[TH: the bots are not that good at complex fights as they cant really see which stones or points are crucial.  If you are beating the bots you need to play mostly against humans except for fun.
See the thread here];W[rp]LB[oo:E][po:F][np:A][op:D][kq:K][lq:I]
[mq:G][oq:B][pq:C][kr:M][lr:J][mr:H][pr:L]C[TH:  after A B C w cannot easily cut at D, F.  After playing thru L b can probably live in the corner and has big center thickness.  See a couple variations]

(;B[pn];W[pq]C[TH: now  white is settled and can turn to other things white black has gained little here]
;B[qp];W[qq];B[ro];W[qh]LB[nc:B][co:A]C[TH:  A or B seem like big points]
;B[rj];W[ce]LB[bf:A]C[TH:  black has a big loose structure, easily invaded or reduced while white is taking a large secure corner.  A helps black get territory while threatening a large reduction later]
;B[gf]LB[bf:A]C[That seemed like a good idea. I definitely helped me, but I was at a loss to what to do for this move. Did I make the right choice? or is there something urgent that needs to be taken care of?

TH: A is now a very large move for white];W[cq]LB[bf:B][cp:A]
C[OUCH!!!

TH: i prefer A for white here as the side is larger than the bottom.  After this and B the moyo is substantially reduced]

(;B[gk];W[qo]C[TH: perhaps w is look for this]
(;B[ji]C[I know I just sacraficed the lower right, but I felt I really needed to kill those two stones before they did major damage. Am I correct in thinking move 55 is more valuable then R5?

TH: stopping these stones is large];W[rn];B[jf]C[Nice, huh?]
;W[ld]
(;B[ph];W[on]C[With that move, things get really messy in the lower right corner. There probably arent any joseki variations for this situation, but how would a better sequence play?

TH:  see variation for previous black move];B[oo];W[po];B[pm]
;W[om];B[ol];W[mn];B[qf]C[Would It have been better to play O14?]

;W[pd];B[oe]C[Y'know, I'm not really sure about this game. And I guess my lack of intriguing question makes that obvious. But really I've just reached a point in my game where I can't really see what's wrong with my gameplay except for minor tactical manuevers. I'm at a loss for how to improve, and as far as I can tell, i played a decent enough game. But GnuGo still beat me. A Computer program beat me, so I know that I have a ways to go. But for the love of god, I can't figure out how to improve. That's why my questions are so bogus, because I don't know what I should be asking, or how to improve my strategy.

So, I am interested in how I can become stronger. Show me the better moves from here on out, and explain why they are better moves, please. Thank you.

On with the game.

TH: white is simply a little bit ahead and it is hard for black to catch up.]

[gn][co][do][fo][go][ho][ep][fp][gp][hp][gq]C[Well, there you have it. I lost by six points, and as far as I can tell, I lost because of these factors:

1. I didn't invade the top.
2. I couldn't keep control of the corners, and...
3. I didn't save my stones in the lower right.

Perhaps you might show me ways to effectively carry out these goals?

I would like to thank you for taking the time out to review this game. I really appreciate it. Thank you.

Signed,

TH: you need to play a lot with human opponents.
Early moves should mostly be on 3rd, 4th lines rather than 5th or 2nd lines.  Your move at O5 didnt put much pressure on the white group and didnt secure territory or influence..
Look at the whole board, what groups are weak (attack or help weak groups is most urgent), where is potential to develop territory?  Make urgent moves before big moves.]
