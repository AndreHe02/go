C[My first game submitted for GTL review. I am  playing black and my comments are prefixed with "BL"

I first learnt to play go about a year ago. Have been playing on and off since then on KGS and IGS.

My rank is 26k on IGS and an unconfirmed 17K on KGS.

Many thanks for your review.

11K: Hi, this is my first review. All my comments will begin with 11k. As you can guess, Im 11kyu. Therefore none of my comments or suggestions are gospel, but hopefully you can learn something anyway.]
;B[qd]C[BL: I don't really know much about fuseki at present so I'm just trying to make corner enclosures

11k: I wouldnt worry much about "memorizing" any fuseki. I dont know anyone below 5kyu who has bothered. Concentrating on getting a feel for the game is more useful]

C[11k: In my opinion, you are playing that too low. Of course if you want to avoid fights as a rule of thumb its ok. However playing it higher makes for a riskier, but potentially more rewarding game]
;W[pm];B[qm];W[pl];B[ql];W[oj];B[pk]C[11K: Here, your play is too reactive. There are loads of bigger points on the board and neither formation of yours on either side of the 9th line was in any danger. A play at C6/F3/C14 or even F17 would be better]
;W[ok];B[cn]C[BL: Was not sure whether to approach at F2 or C6. Chose C6 in the end to avoid White sketching out left + top-side framework.

11K: I believe you made the correct choice. F3 is safe, but much too small]
;W[fq]LB[ck:C][bp:B][cp:A][cq:D]
(;B[cp]C[11k: I believe this move was inefficient for your purposes. It forces W to fortify his position while still leaving your position a bit weak. (See Variations)]
;W[cq];B[do];W[bp]C[BL: I have no real joseki knowledge so am just playing this as I go along...]
;B[bo]C[BL: I know, no ko threats in the openning...but could not see a good alternative to this.

11k: You're seeing the problem a little after the fact. best would be to have made Move 23 C5 instead of D5]
;W[ep];B[cf]C[BL: now trying to extend in other direction];W[bd]
LB[fc:E][ce:B][ee:A][df:C][ci:D]
(;B[ee]C[11k: Strange Move. But it was a strange position. See variations.]
;W[ph];B[qh]C[11k: Ineifficient imo. Neither group was in danger of dying. You should have used that move to build territory/Moyo at the left side of the board.]
;W[pi];B[qi];W[ed];B[de];W[gd];B[cd];W[cc];B[ce];W[db];B[be]
;W[ad]LB[ci:B][di:C][ol:A]C[BL: I feel game is balanced. White has top + influence on right. Black has a position on left + territory to right + some stakes in the bottom.]

(;B[ol]C[11k: Id still concentrate on making territory on the left at this point.]
;W[pj];B[qk];W[pn];B[om];W[qn];B[rn];W[po];B[qp];W[no];B[op]
;W[oo];B[mm];W[np];B[nq];W[nl];B[nm];W[ll];B[ng]C[BL: I felt confident to leave P7 group (wrong) and  wanted to reduce what looked like a large white moyo developing

11k: 3 choices: 1) Reduce moyo 2) Try to kill O4 formation 3) Develop weak left. On the balance of things, I would think 2) was the best option.]
;W[og];B[of];W[pg];B[nf];W[qg];B[rf]C[11k: Looks odd. I would go for R14 instead.]
;W[ml]C[BL: I am torn between retaining connection to upper right corner and giving P7 group more breathing space.

11k: Id still go for the P7. The upper group as a somewhat good chance of making an eye by running to the center and another eye on the side/corner]
;B[rg]C[BL: I pick to retain territory and connection on right side...]
;W[lm];B[mn];W[lo];B[mo];W[mp];B[lp]C[BL: I believe that P7 group is dead but White misses it.]
;W[ln];B[mq];W[kp];B[lq];W[ip]C[BL: I mistakenly believe that the P7 group is alive in seki...White misses this also.]
;B[jp];W[jo];B[kq];W[ko];B[iq];W[hp];B[pp]C[BL: I manage to save the P7 group but now White has a strong outer facing wall. My assessment is that the game is in White's favour now.]
;W[ck]LB[gf:A][dl:B]
(;B[gf]C[BL: I realise it is a mistake not to answer White's invasion...
11k: Yup. Frankly barring mistakes, this looks almost like resign time. (see variation)]
;W[ch];B[bi]C[BL: ...as eventually, I must.];W[bh];B[ci];W[di]
;B[dh];W[dg];B[eh];W[bj];B[ah]C[BL: My reading of the fighting here is not good...]
;W[ag];B[bg];W[ai];B[cg];W[ah];B[ei];W[dj];B[ej];W[ek];B[fk]
;W[el];B[af]C[BL: Here I feel there has been an enforced exchange of influence for the left side territory. I am now worried about the stones around C5.

11k: By all rights, C5 should be unsalvagable.

Also I believe  A14 is unnnecesary, never TRY to make 2 eyes. The tradeoff for the security is too great. Here you have 1 solid eye and place to run. Makes more sense to extend outwards making territory/ threatning to invade. The second eye will form itself in the process. (Possible alternative moves - J15 or H10)]
;W[cj];B[ae];W[bc];B[dl];W[fl];B[dk];W[cl];B[dm];W[bl];B[ak]
C[BL: I am trying to find a way of attacking the cutting stones (E8)

11k: All A9 did was force your opponent to make a move that he would want to make anyway. Not a good idea. I would consider E8 alive, barring mistakes.]
;W[al];B[gk];W[gl]C[BL: My assessment is wrong: the cutting stones (E8) are too close to white's wall to be successfully attacked]
;B[id]C[BL: I try to attack the top instead (trying to create some territory in the upper centre of the board.

11k: Too far. J15 better.];W[he];B[hd];W[hf];B[ge]C[11k: Your opponent is overconfident. You have a chance again.]
;W[fd];B[hg];W[fe]C[11k: More urgent imo is F14. You will most probably be able to kill H14 group anyway.]
;B[if];W[ff]C[BL: Critical move (possibly game losing?) C15 group is in danger of being cut-off. I feel my chances now lie in some upper middle territory so sacrifce the C15 group]
;B[ie];W[eg];B[fg];W[ef];B[gc];W[fh];B[gg]C[BL: Misreading. Should connect the E11 group.]
;W[fj];B[fc];W[ec];B[fb]C[11k: too many one pointer moves. Better to threaten the weak stones at M17 group  or make territory at the center.]

;B[cb]C[BL: Mistake...this is not even a ko threat.

--------------------------------------------

So white wins. I would appreciate any advice. I feel the fuseki is something I particularly need to work on?

Also any general points would be gratefully received.

11k: In conclusion if you would go for the biggest points in yose you could have won.

Your play is a little too reactive for my taste, and you play too much for local security which negates your stones working together over long distances. 

As for the fuseki, dont get caught up in the formally played moves, simply avoid fights and map out as many corner/side postions as you can.

Good Game.])
