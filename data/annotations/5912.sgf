C[I am black and am looking for suggestions.  See move 8.];B[pd]
;W[mg];B[dp];W[gm];B[pp];W[mm];B[dd];W[gg]C[My main question is did I deal with the opening appropriately.  I am black and my opponent was stronger than me and adopted this unusual opening which I think I responded too passively to.  I am also interested in any suggestions for improvement as I have hit a wall with my current ranking on kgs and am not sure what I should study to improve my play.

SGF:  I do not think so.  By playing these moves you are essentially saying "Here are four coners to invade and let me have thickness.  And oh, by the way, you already nulllfied all that thickness."  One or two start points are ok but I would also play a couple of 3-4s.]
;B[jq]C[SGF:  Hard to say this is wrong, but I would play a keima from one of the star points in order to protect that corner.  If W now invades the two lower corners then this stone is probably not going to do too much,.]
;W[nc];B[qg];W[fc]
(;B[dg]C[SGF:  This is too loose.  You cannot expect to gain much useful influence, which is the goal of the move.  I would try something like the variation and reduce the w top while fixing the shape.]
;W[cn]
(;B[fp]C[SGF: This is a tought situation.  There really is not a good move. This point and the left are miai.  Perhaps it is best to ignore this move and take the offensive.  One of many possible variations is shown.  It is probably not the best sequence but it give the idea of what I am thinking.]
;W[ci]
(;B[ch]C[Is this the right response to c11.  In hindsight, the next few moves by black seem too territorial and confined.  Would something like d11 be a better variation.

SGF:  This is definitely wrong.  The corner is still open and you are defending territory. You need to get out into the middle to reduce the budding moyo.]
;W[di];B[db]C[SGF: UNfortunately this is almost required, but it is a pity to have to take gote with a position as open as this.]
;W[cf]C[Is there a better way to deal with this invasion.

SGF:  I looked at several sequences and could find nothing better if you want to capture this stone.  However, it is probably better to let W connect out and follow the variation to move 23]
;B[df];W[ce]
(;B[cg];W[de];B[ee];W[ed];B[cd];W[ef];B[fe];W[ge]
(;B[ff]LB[fd:A]C[SGF: The atari at A does not work out so good (see variation).  The key was to play at A earlier in the sequence when W could not afford to ignore it.  See variation for move 27]
;W[fg];B[eg];W[fd]
(;B[ne]C[SGF: This is a very funny move.  It is not at all clear what the goal is.  Gping one point further seems more likely to reduce.]

;W[me];B[md];W[nd]
(;B[le];W[mf]C[SGF: There is no chance for this to work if W plays correctly.  This is like playing inside a solid territory.  Atari from the other side is the only chance to make something work,]
;B[mc];W[mb];B[nb];W[ob];B[na];W[oa];B[oc];W[ma];B[nb];W[na]
;B[od];W[nb];B[kc]C[I thought I came out well in this exchange since the o19 group is heavy and weak and the black L17 group invades territory that was previously white's.

In hindsight however I have 2 weak split groups whose defense won't leave me with much territory.

SGF:  This is exactly right. Even if the L17 group lives it will be at a huge cost.  W can live in the corner very easily and B ends up with nothing to the right.]
;W[qc];B[lb];W[pb];B[qd];W[rd];B[re];W[rc];B[id];W[hc]C[SGF:  B has acheived very little. the exchange of the corner from B to W is a huge loss to B.]
;B[jf]LB[ic:A]C[SGF:  Playing A first results in a better shape.]
;W[jh];B[ih]TR[me][mf][mg]C[SGF:  Wrong side.  W is weaker on the right and so B has more chance by trying to isolate the 3 three marked stones.]
;W[ig];B[jg];W[if];B[kh];W[ji];B[ic];W[eb];B[ab];W[je];B[ke]
;W[ie];B[kg];W[ki];B[jd];W[lh]C[SGF: As predicted, B lived but at a big cost.  W is all connected on the outside and even gets sente.]

(;B[li];W[ld];B[lc];W[kf];B[jb];W[qi]LB[ne:A]C[SGF:  B is really struggling.  An the point is that this was all sort of inevitable 60 moves earlier when B played the wrong point at A]
;B[ph];W[pi];B[oh];W[oi];B[mh];W[lg];B[ni];W[lj]LB[pk:A]C[SGF:  Bad point.  Let's B counterattack at the point A.  Capturing this single stone is not a big deal.]
;B[nj]C[SGF:  Too timid.  This just invites W to extend and form a base.  B cannot play this slowly because of the W moyo.]
;W[ok]LB[pf:B][pl:A]C[SGF:  Too close. The point A works better.  B cannot do much because of the threat of a W move at B, so just taking territory and waiting is better.]
;B[pf];W[qn]C[SGF:  This bears a poor relationship to the previous W move so B needs to try to take advantage of it.  There is no direct way to do this, so the best way it to make sure that the play does not disturb the aji.]
;B[mp]C[SGF:  To loose.  Holding bad on point is better.  While B hs a weakness here he cannot do anything about W's bad aji.]
;W[hq]C[SGF: Too ambitious.  W will lose the moyo around E8.  Better to secure the moyo with E6 and leave this move and te corner as miai]
;B[hp];W[gp]
(;B[gq]C[SGF:  Better to atari above and use it to invade the W moyo above.]
;W[go];B[fq];W[ip];B[hr];W[ho];B[ir]C[SGF:  B just helped W strengthen the moyo in exchange for 2nd line territory.]

(;B[hb]C[SGF: Too small at this point.  THere is too much aji in the lowe right quadrant to be taking gote.  Try something like the variation.]
