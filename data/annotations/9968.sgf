;B[dp]C[Hello dear reviewer,

thank you very much for looking over my game. It was played on Tygem and I lost quite badly, but I don't really know why. It seems that when playing I miss a huge amount of ways that all my groups can be cut appart and killed, which my opponents at this rank are now capable of doing. I also really don't know what happened in the opening of this game. Please try to validate or correct my comments as much as possible, as they reflect my thought process leading to the moves, which needs to be corrected.  Also please focus on general principles, common shapes and the expectations/aims that go with the moves rather than complicated variations involving reading, except when the patterns are likely to occur often.

MR: Dear adomasu,
please find comments in the file always starting with "MR".
I tried to answer many of the question you posted in the file.

Altogether, my feeling is that you should step back every now and then within a game and ask yourself about the main goals.
Which groups are weak and which are strong, both of you and your opponent?
What are the biggest moves on the board?
In the first part of the game, both you and your opponent tend to play in the area the other player played before, sometimes loosing sight of nearly dead groups or very big moves.

A second important point is: You cannot get everything! If you get strong on one side or get territory there, your opponent will most likely also get strength or territory somewhere else on the board. This is normal and you do not need to prevent this!

Third important point, that mainly occurred in the second part of the game: You do not need to exploit every weakness of your opponent at once! Most weaknesses are best left alone. Sooner or later, your opponent has to care for the weakness and maybe cannot invade as deep as he wants or has to spend an extra move in the area. You will get some reward, but maybe in another area of the board!]
;W[pd];B[qp];W[cd]C[At 3k people fortunately don't just take all 3-3s and try to attack your wall anymore, which is probably still the best way to win against me. I'm still reluctant to play two 4-4s though.

MR: You can try out different openings and find out what suits you best.]
;B[nc]C[This is already unusual? I play R14 expecting to get sente and play some of the assymetric corners.

MR: I personally prefer E16 or R14, but this is more or less a matter of style.]

(;W[qf];B[pb]C[Here I should maybe bably tenuki and play P3? I'm not sure how my C16 stone affects the decisions to deal with the O17 approach. Pincers didn't seem reasonable at first glance.

MR: You cannot expect to get everything! Black chose to play O17 instead of R14. So he decided not to expand the right side fitting to his R4 corner, but to "destroy" potential upper side white territory. You decided to establish a position on the right side with R14. So both players try to avoid large areas of influence by the other side. 

Of cource, you can play tenuki here, if you are willing to give black the choice of whether he wants to play R17 or R12. In this game, he will probably choose R17.]

(;W[qc];B[kc];W[op]C[Hard to decide between P4 and P3. I thought P4 is better since it's possible  I get to build the center after leaning on black's top group eventually.

MR: Both are ok, as long as you know some standard joseki.]

(;B[pn]C[Is this good? On the one hand black's move at R12 seems sente against my corner group, so maybe black can expect to make territory on the right, on the other hand my move on the right side could be sente against black's group and allow me to build the side. I really don't know. In pro games black prefers P3 in a position like this.

MR: You are right in that black cannot expect substantial territory on the right side and that white usually has a good follow up at R8. I am not so sure that taking the corner with P3 is very attractive, as the right side is uninteresting for both sides. Maybe black should think about a pincer with N3, which would fit with D4.]
;W[qq];B[rq];W[pq]
(;B[mp]C[this is weird. Black is apparantly trying to kill me, which isn't reasonable but could still work. I think one possible move is M4 instead? The joseki after that seems rather crazy and I don't understand the moves.

MR: No, black is *not* trying to kill you. He is just using D4, maybe because he got aware that the standard joseki does not fit well for him ...]
;W[rr]C[not sure if this is the right way. I want two things here: live in the corner and get the first move on the right side. Tenuki for black is an option here though, I think.]

(;B[rp];W[ql]C[I thought this was very big in the game. However black could respond more agressively.]

(;B[sr]C[This move is bad. black is trying to kill me, but it's too slow.

MR: At least black is robbing whites base, so white has to do "something" with his stones.]
;W[qn]C[This move is probably bad. I'm trying to solidify my position on the right in sente and then escape with my P4 group while leaning on N4, but that gives black more on the bottom than I get on the side?

MR: Again, you cannot get everything. You have a weak group on the lower side, and the stone S8 is light. So you should care for the lower group and not weaken it further!]
;B[po];W[no]C[don't know if this move is good. Playing on the bottom seems too cramped and after something like S1 (that's the correct response from an endgame/eyeshape point of view, isn't it?) seems way too slow and not even guaranteed life. Attacking black's Q6 group doesn't seem possible.

MR: At least it is correct that you cannot live locally. (After all, chances for good shape are gone by now ...)]
;B[qr]C[taking the one eye that I had in gote.

MR: You did not "have" the eye! It is quite sensible by black that he wants to secure life for his group while keeping your group weak.]
;W[pr];B[rs];W[pm]C[this might be an overplay. I still want to solidify my position on the right in sente.

MR: Off topic again! 
What is your weakest group?]
(;B[nn]C[MR: Pushing from behind (=bad).];W[mo];B[kp]C[bad move. Black should extend instead, which would lead to me having to run with my group. That would probably be a sizable advantage to black. Like this I can almost live locally.

MR: Why do you think this is bad?];W[lp]C[I think this is good.]
;B[lq];W[lo]
(;B[kq]C[maybe black should connect the other side?

MR: Black can connect on the other side and simply catch cutting stones (see variation).]
;W[mq]C[I don't think this is slow. Also threatens to cut at P6.

MR: This makes white nearly alive.];B[om]C[black responds. At this point I thought I needed to protect my investment in the R6 group and finish a low shape on the right side. That's probably not a good result overall.]

(;W[qj]C[white's right side is low. Black gets to play a big point.
MR: Too low.]
(;B[gq]C[I always wonder if it's better to play Something like black's move here or rather the other side of the corner, something like C6, inviting white to invade on the bottom? Also I wonder if black shouldn't play high rather than low?

MR: Feels strange. Black should have more fighting spirit (see variation).]

(;W[ko]C[this is a bad exchange. I can't really do anything with the 3-stone wall facing black's strong shape and Black's move at K5 helps him very much to build the bottom.

MR: Bad move. Good time to do something very different. How about D10 which supports the white group from the distance and reduces the expansion options for black?]
;B[mr]C[black inserts this move. Maybe I should actually ignore and follow up around K5?]
;W[nq];B[jo]C[here I'm very unsure how I would handle a black move approaching my top left corner. Thus I take the enclosure allowing black to play on the left side first.

MR: Also off topic. White can either live with O2 or run to the center, so black cannot kill white with one move after K6.]

(;W[ec];B[cj]C[At this point in the game I decide that reducing black's bottom left side directly (something like C6? Maybe B5) is too dangerous and plan for invading at 3-3 in the corner, since black made a double wing leaving that open. First I play the move C12, since it's big and I expected black to respond with me ending in sente. That probably shouldn't happen though?.

MR: If black played at C10, C12 is only the second largest move on the side ... so one should come up with a different plan.
It is correct that invading the corner is the standard plan in a double wing formation.]
;W[ch]
(;B[dh]C[this is a strange move...

MR: Yes. Both of you should more often think about tenuki.]
;W[dg];B[di]C[I think I can tenuki now. Black has built considerable influence and the invasion seems forced now? Maybe I should choose a different move though, something like B4 or C4 rather than the 3-3 invasion?]
;W[cq];B[cp];W[dq]C[I wonder what happens if black tries to kill me here.]

(;B[bq]C[is this good for white or will white die?])
(;B[eq];W[er];B[fr];W[ep];B[fq];W[bp];B[bo];W[bq];B[cn];W[dr]
C[unfortunately black is so solid, that the E4 stone has no aji. black could play something like K7 even. He chose to play more solidly.

MR: Again, you cannot get everything. At least you live in the corner ...]
;B[jn];W[jk]C[I try to reduce lightly while looking forward to building the right side of the center after leaning on black's top group. In terms of raw points the game might be about even.]
;B[il]C[maybe black could respond more agressively.];W[gj];B[fk]
;W[gk];B[gl];W[fj]C[this might be an overplay];B[ek];W[bi]C[this is a bad move. I thought it would fix the C13 weakness while setting up good endgame but it's way to slow.]
;B[bj]C[black should not respond. He should attack my center group instead.]
;W[ej]C[overplay.];B[dj]
(;W[fg]C[now begins the difficult part of the game where black decides that I'm trying to get too much (which is probably true, at least enaugh to win) and fights me for everything. Turns out black is better at reading.

MR: Locally strange shape. Better at E13.];B[cg]C[I decide that sacrificing C12 for a solid top left territory and also a strengthened connection towards the center is good, however there doesn't seem to be an alternative to atari on black's stone.]

(;W[cf]
(;B[fh]C[
unexpected move. I was expecting black to play E13 instead, in which case I would have played as in the variation.

MR: Bad. Usual move would be B13.];W[eh];B[ei];W[eg]C[this exchange improves my shape a lot.]
;B[gh]C[but black doesn't connect. During the game I thought this is an overplay but couldn't figure out a way to punish. From here on everything went downhill as black demonstrated his superior fighting skills. Please tell me how I can save my middle group while keeping my territories.

MR: Why should black connect? This would be bad shape. And white's center group is weak plus black has backup at L17.]

(;W[hk]C[bad move. Black shouldn't respond here. The push at H8 doesn't do anything.

MR: Bad shape and no help.
White should step back and think about where he wants to make territory. The G10 stones are not important at all!]
;B[hl]
(;W[hg]C[trying to induce black to connect.

MR: Strange move. Again, you should simply make territory! How about J17 or O9?

Hint: One does not need to exploit enemies weakness *at once*. Usually, it pays to leave things alone. Later, it is your opponent who has to care about his left over weaknesses!]
;B[gg]C[here I decide that I can't just block and let black cut me.]

(;W[fi]C[MR: Nonsense. Has to be at G14. The cut here is unimportant and makes the heavy stonds H9 important for you. Very bad!]
;B[gf];W[hc]C[this might be an overplay. At this point I'm actually trying to kill black, which is a mistake.

MR: No, you are making territory, which is good. The stones in the middle are less important.]
;B[hi]C[bad peep for black.

MR: Yes, black is only helping white.];W[ik];B[ji];W[lk];B[ok]
C[Black says that he's fine in the center and goes to reduce my potential while attacking my center group.

MR: Good move by black, separating stones while reducing potential territory.]
;W[nl]C[not sure if this peep is good.

MR: Bad. Again, do not try to exploit everything you imagine to see at once!]
;B[nm]C[no idea what that move is about.];W[ol];B[ml];W[mk]

(;B[kl];W[kk];B[nk];W[pl]C[black has created another weak group. However black's shape around M7 is bad and I could connect if he doesn't fix there.]
;B[rn]C[terrible move which doesn't do anything. I guess black is planing to kill the R8 group?]
;W[mi]C[I try to capture the O9 stones. I guess black could run them out though. If white can capture those stones, he should be ahead on territory.

MR: The move is okay. Securing your group while building territory is fine.]
;B[qo]C[this threatens to kill the bottom. Maybe I should go after the aji with a move like M8 now. Instead I decide to live on the bottom.]
;W[nr]C[MR: That's fine.];B[bg]C[bad move for black. This is too small.]

(;W[ie]C[This is an overplay. Black can not be killed in the center and I don't even need to kill him to win. I didn't count though (had lost a game by 10 points where I counted myself ahead previous to this).

MR: Strange logic ...  
The move feels got as it puts pressure on black.]

;B[kf]
