C[Comments for black by  David J. King (gnik, British 2 kyu).
Dated: 4th January, 1998]PL[B];B[pd]BL[51];W[cp]WL[49];B[dd]

WL[43];B[gp]BL[31];W[cn]WL[41];B[jq]C[Too cramped.  The rule of thumb is to extend n+1 spaces from an
n high wall, so here you should play L3 (which is joseki).  If you
don't like that position then you could have played F4 instead of
G4 which would make K3 the right extension (also joseki).]BL[24]
;W[mq]WL[38];B[qn]BL[18];W[qp]WL[35];B[pk]BL[14];W[qf]WL[33]
;B[qh]C[janr: i thought this move was good because it pincers r14 and at the  same time completes the right side group

gnik: yes, it looks right to me.]BL[11];W[qc]C[janr: in the sequence that follows i certainly made an error. I  encountered this problem already several times, but i cant spot which move is  the bad one.  Most joseki dictionaries don't contain answers to bad moves  (just good ones).  Can someone suggest
a good (preferably internet) joseki dictionary?

gnik: Jan van der Steen has the best Internet joseki dictionary I've
seen.  Check it out on: http://www.cwi.nl/~jansteen/go/joseki/]
WL[30];B[qd]C[janr: perhaps it was better to just play a and get a wall after black  b, white c, but this looks so easy for white that I always first play white b.

gnik: this looks like the correct side to me.]BL[8];W[pc]WL[28]

(;B[oc]C[P16 is more usual when there's a stone at R14, see variation.]
BL[7];W[rc]C[This white move looks like a trick play.  I think it's in one of the
books, but I haven't got the book.  Defending the cut at P16 actually
gives black a reasonable result, especially with D16.  Otherwise, if
white cuts it looks awkward for black.]WL[27];B[rd]C[janr: now i can play a (which also leaves the cut at b), b or d, and  the e when white connects (so i get my wall, but now one space on column p  instead of q), or c which leaves perhaps more possibilities to connect with  r12 (but this is difficult to read out)]
BL[468];W[od]WL[24];B[nc]C[janr: as bad as the previous move. perhaps the sequence a,b,c would be  better.]
BL[463];W[pe]C[At this point, I would be thinking of cutting the losses and gaining as
much as possible by playing forcing moves to threaten to save the
three black stones.  See variation.

Things can often get worse if you try to save the unsaveable.]

Maybe R11 (a), since white playing there looks like sente.]

;W[kp]C[janr: i have the impression that the sequence that follows (up to move  61 on m7) is rather small (there are still some big point on the left/upper  side) and a little better for black than for white (is it?)

gnik: Black D10 looks really big to me.  But I would probably play on
the lower black group to make it safer.  I like the look of L3, since
it makes black safer and is threatening to white.]WL[461];B[oo]

BL[477];W[hd]C[janr: good white move.]WL[428];B[gd]C[janr: is that good?  perhaps a is better

   White = 51 territory + 34 captures + 0.5 komi = 85.5
   Black = 60 territory + 38 captures = 98
Black wins by 12.5.

Congratulations on winning!  The capture in the lower left corner
probably make the difference.  Apart from that the most notable
things were perhaps the upper corners.  You came out all right, but
I think things could have been worse.  So I would recommend learning
a few joseki, or at least learning how to avoid complicated josekis.
I would also recommend reading something on the end-game, it's
surprising how much can be won or lost there.]PL[B])
