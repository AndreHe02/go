;B[pd];W[pp];B[cd];W[dp];B[ec]LB[dj:A]C[Black A would be a very good extension from the corner enclosure.
Therefore I would play there myself as white.];W[jp];B[dj];W[pj]
;B[cn]LB[fp:A]C[I would answer at A.];W[dl]LB[en:A][fp:B]C[It is usually not good to play a pincer like this when the pincering stone
becomes weak immideately.
I think black A is a good move now. It makes the white pincer even weaker
and it threatens to enclose the white corner stone with B.]
;B[fq]LB[eo:A][dn:B]C[Black tries to make the situation difficult.
I would answer at A or B in order to get out in the center.
In a situation like this, you should not hope for any corner territory.]

C[White is enclosed with about 15 points of territory in the corner.
But look how strong black is. Whites all other prospects
at the bottom are gone.];W[qf];B[qe]TR[pj]C[Bad move.
White gets good shape because of the marked stone and there is
still the invasion on 3-3 point.];W[pf]C[The right side now looks very good for white.]
;B[nc];W[jd];B[qn];W[qo]C[This time it is playable because white can attack black.]
;B[pn];W[nq];B[qj]LB[qk:A]C[Difficult position. I think wnite is behind in the game, so he should maybe
play A to make the game even more difficult.];W[qi];B[qk];W[ph]
;B[kq]LB[kp:A]TR[nq]C[Here I think white should answer at A.
The stone marked with a triangle stops black from making too much  damage and the white stone at K4 is a bit too weak because of the black  wall. I would say that white has a good chance to make some outside
influence here.];W[jq];B[mp];W[kr];B[mq];W[mr];B[lr];W[nr];B[jr]
;W[ir]LB[kp:A]C[This move was probably better at A.
To save his stones, white has to get out in the center.
No use to try to cut black off from his wall.];B[ks];W[hq];B[hp]

[ir][hq][ip][jp][jq][jn][jm]LB[lo:A][mn:B]C[The weak groups are the marked ones and both players should
try to strengthen his own group while attacking the others.
White could maybe start at A or B.];W[dg]LB[ko:A]C[Black A strengtherns the black group in sente.]
;B[fj];W[ci];B[ck];W[fd];B[fc];W[gc];B[kc]C[Good move by black.]

;W[cf];B[nf]LB[ib:A]TR[jc][kc]C[White A, which threatens to capture the marked stones and make  eyes is a good move now.]

;W[me]C[This sequence removed the possibility for white to invade on the 3-3 point.
Furthermore, it did nothing concerning the safety of the white group.]
;B[of]C[But at least it was in sente. ;-)];W[kh];B[ni]C[Black has a territorial lead and his groups are safer.
Black should win.];W[ml];B[nk];W[mn];B[np];W[op];B[oo];W[mk]

But the black stones are dead since white A puts them in atari.  See continuation.

Even if white kills black here, black still has a 30 point lead so maybe
white should resign anyway.];W[qs];B[ss];W[qs]C[A snap-back!]
