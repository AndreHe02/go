[oq][rq]C[White is unlucky! The moves at the  letters 'a' to 'e' are all joseki according to Ishida's dictionary, but the  move played in the game is probably considered as a little too passive.]

(;B[mo]L[on]C[This move leave black with a unsatisfactory shape, later  white can perhaps cut or threaten a cut with a move near 'a'. See the  variation at B for a slightly better result for Black.]
;W[qf]L[jd][nc][nd]C[Perhaps white is a little unpatient here. Black can now attack and  take the initiative. The calm approach would be to play 'a' which is the  vital point on the board, if White want to take risks perhaps 'b' or 'c' is a  good way to start a fight. I  cannot say that the move in the game is bad but at least I want to point out  some more relaxed alternatives.]
;B[qe];W[pf];B[nd];W[qh];B[qi];W[mg]L[ph][nj][rg]C[The standard pattern is White 'a', Black 'b' and White  20. White is now risking his eyeshape. The point of playing 'a' is that White  can later play 'c' and be almost 100% alive if this group is surrounded.]
;B[ni]L[ph][og][of][nf][ng][ne]C["The vital point of your opponent is often your vital point  as well". This move just simulates the expected result when black play R11,  but here White has made a mistake and omitted a move. Black should play 'a'  which would give him a clear lead i
n this game. Black 'a' is very good because it make Black stronger, it  crushes whites eyeshape and it threaten to play the simple but strong  sequence beginning with Black 'b' that would cleanly cut through Whites  group. Now White still has the chance to p
lay at 'a' and if so we are back to the expected result, except that Black  has played keima at 21 which is perhaps a little to aggressive, at least not  better than then the normal result.]
;W[lc]L[ph]C[White is sligtly unreasonable here, since white has not completed  the shape of his weak group. A black move at 'a' is of course severe but it  would be a little overconcentrated because of the earlier mistake, so the  prospects for white in this fig
ht is perhaps still better. Still it typical that if you can play a move that  give you a small but guaranteed advantage one always prefer some crazy move  that might be better...]
;B[me]C[This look like a good  point aiming at the defects in the white position.]
;W[oh]C[Probably  necessary but there is is still a lot of defects in the shape.]
;B[kd];W[jc];B[kc];W[kb];B[lb]L[ld]C[Everyone  whant to play like this in this shape, but it often turn out that 'a' is the  vital point and should therefore be played first. White would be left with  two weak groups and Black could pick a target.]
;W[mb];B[jb];W[la];B[ic]L[ld]C[The problem with 'a' will haunt  Black now since white can cut the Black position with a move there.]
;W[oc];B[pc]L[od]C[Black could be cut with 'a' now as well  and things are very uncertain now. If Black simply answers the peep with 'a'  he can perhaps plan a severe counter attack against the other White group.]
;W[ld];B[ke];W[le];B[kf]L[ob][od]C[Playing a move like  this is almost like accepting the collapse but there are no good moves left,  probably 'a' or 'b' is best saving the corner and perhaps take sente if White  conects the groups, thus minimizing the damage done.]
;W[od];B[oe];W[pe];B[ob];W[nc];B[nb];W[mc];B[rd];W[qb]
(;B[qc];W[pb];B[rb];W[oa];B[rf];W[rg]L[ec]C[White is kind to Black  and play here in gote. It is worth about 12-15 points + the strategic effect  of stopping the connection. White should
play 'a' instead and not give Black the chance to use his thickness and take  back the initiative.]
;B[ed]L[kf]C[Even if Black  luckily got sente to play here White really got a lot of profit in the upper  right and the move at 'a' does not do much work now...]
;W[ec]C[I  think this is a good move since it forces Black to make a small territory in  front of the thickness. It make it hard for Black to fight back.]
;B[fc]L[dd][dc][ce]C[Perhaps Black 'a', White 'b' Black 'c' would be a  way to fight back and perhaps even trick White into a unfavourable fight. But  still it look like white can get away easily.]
;W[dc];B[ee]L[fb][fd][ff][eg]C[This look like a compromise. Perhaps the simple way  would be to play 'a' instead which is very big territorially, and if White  cuts at 'b', Black will extend to 59 and start a fight. If White now play 'a'  it look like Black have not got any substa
nce at all from this fight. If Black want to play in the center perhaps  something like 'c' and 'd' is better.]
;W[cf];B[dg];W[cg];B[dh];W[ci]L[dn]C[This move is natural but I think it is  mor natural to try to frustrate Black with a move at 'a' or something since  this is important both locally and it seem to netralize the Black expansion  in the center.]
;B[ch]L[bh][cj][ej][ck]C[This is wrong, black has no good  followup and has probably confused this move with a pattern in a joseki where  it work better. It is better to leave this or play 'c' or later 'd'.  Depending on further fighting the peep at 'a' can become very profi
table and the somewhat odd contact move at 'b' is often an underestimated and  overlooked tesuji.]
;W[bh];B[bi]L[bg][cj]C[If  White now was forced to play at 'a' allowing Black to capture at 'b' this  would be a succes for Black, but this is not the case. Black is trying to get  some thickness in sente but in fact it is White who gains both territory and  thickness.]
;W[bj];B[di];W[cj]L[ck][bh][df][di]C[Suddenly  White has a moyo in the lower left. Before the erroneous sacrifice a move at  black 'a' would have threatened a peep at 'b', so the loss greater than it  perhaps look like. Black's only gain is free moves at 'c' and 'd'. It must be  obvious  now what a huge loss in sente Black has forced upon himself.]
;B[co]C[This stone is now very weak.];W[cp]L[dn][eo][ep][fp]C[This a special move. The aim should be to make Black heavy and  attack. This is a good idea considering the black mistake preceding this  situation. But White also have to consider the Black center and this move  might provoke Black to play escape to
 the right and build up the center in the same process. Perhaps one of the  moves at 'a' to 'd' is better but the situation is difficult to evaluate so I  do not know anything of any certainity.]
;B[do];W[fq];B[ek]C[Black take his chance.];W[dm]L[fq]C[... But  it is slightly unreasonable though. White should aim at attacking the two  heavy Black stones. Not with the intention of capturing them but to break  into the center perhaps in sente, pressing Black against the low solid stone  at 'a'.]
;B[fo];W[en];B[eo];W[hp]L[gm]C[At 'a' is also tempting but this move look better at second  thought since it induces Black to escape upwards into the Black moyo but with  White in front of him.]
;B[gn];W[in]L[fl]C[But this nisses the point  now Black get away and build up the upper left center. I think a White move  at 'a' would be the way to fight back more strongly.]
;B[km]L[gl]C[Wrong. A move at 'a' is safer and perhaps even more profitable as well.]
;W[il]L[io]C[White get ahead and should be satisfied unless  Black can cut with 'a'.]
;B[gp];W[hq]L[io]C[White is  happy since the Black push was aji keshi. Black must defend his weak stones  before he try something like this and cutting with 'a' look to better style  if Black want to try something here.]
;B[io]C[Black  contradicts himself! It is now easier for White to capture the black cutting  stone.]
;W[ho];B[hn];W[hm];B[gm]C[It get  complicated and Black chickens out. He should have defended the groups first,  then cut... not the other way around.]
;W[jo];B[jq]L[gq][gr][hr]C[Aji keshi again. Black may have done something here with  Black 'a', White 'b' and Black 'c' threatening many thing simultaenously.]
;W[ip];B[hl];W[im];B[ij]L[hk][ik]C[Clicko? If Black play 'a' he can hane at 97 if White push at 'b'. Now White  have more options to play with.]
;W[hk];B[gl];W[ik];B[gi]L[km]C[The Black position seem to become weaker and weaker and White  just get stronger. The Black stone at 'a' start to look weak.]

 garm 16k : Oops. Actually clicko... :-/];B[hi];W[hj]L[ji]C['a' is better since it make  work in the future. Capturing the Black stone is meaningless territorially  and the move played here do no work since it is a dame (point of no value).]
;B[oq];W[or];B[rq];W[rr];B[rp];W[lq];B[lp];W[jh];B[jg];W[fb]C[This is very big, the  move played in the lower right was also big but White can play here in sente.  So Black should have played here first.]

L[ni]C[If black try to save the Black stone He might lose the  stone at 'a' instead!]
;W[kn];B[ko];W[jn];B[bp];W[bq];B[kh];W[ji];B[mf]C[If Black cannot break  out he will loose lot of points.]

[rh];B[sg];W[sh];B[se];W[pi];B[qj];W[lg];B[kg];W[oi];B[oj];W[of];C[White has around 75 points and Black perhaps 65 so it look like a easy win  for White now. Black lost because he failed to take advantage of some of  White mistakes. At several times he literally tried to force himself to an  advantage and just harme
d himself. Removing Whites weaknesses before he had a chance to profit from  them.]
)
(;B[pb]C[Black naturally want to play here but there is a lot hings  white can try here so it understandable if Black is careful here.]
;W[qc];B[rc];W[qd];B[re];W[rb];B[sb]C[It look like Black can get away with this, but it  is risky.]
))
(;B[np]C[This builds solid thickness, it may look as Black has a  wide gap in his formation but this not as dangerous as it might look.]
;W[mp];B[mo];W[lo]C[This is the normal way to play strongly for White.]
;B[lp];W[mq];B[mn]L[nr][mr][jq]C[This result look ugly for White. The stone at 'a' should have been  played elsewhere. If it had been played at 'b' instead White could later play  at 'c' and be connected. This sequence with 'b' played instead of 'a' is  conidered as joseki.]
