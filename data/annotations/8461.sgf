C[Hello! I hope this commentary will be helpful. I have commented your questions but also some other things. My comments start with "Kalle:".

Your sense of direction in this game is good, most of the mistakes are tactical in nature. I have added some variations and my suggestions. I have also commented on some Black moves here and there, when I thought it was important.

Enjoy!];B[pd];W[dp];B[pp];W[ec];B[dc];W[dd];B[cd];W[db];B[cc]
;W[ed];B[de];W[ic];B[cb]
(;W[nc];B[nd]LB[md:A][od:B]C[Kalle: This is where your problems at the top started. You need to find a good answer to this Black's move. White has two options here, A and B.

Move A is the normal one, and it works well with the white formation on the top side.

Move B is sharper, and it has more variations. It allows Black to build thickness towards the right side, which is not something White would like.

In my opinion, White should play at A.]
(;W[qf]C[Kalle: This move is strange, it allows Black to make ideal shape on the top. To see this move from another perspective, look at my variation starting at move 14.

See also the variation to Black's next move (move 17)]
(;B[pf]LB[md:B][pg:A]C[Kalle: White is in trouble now. It's impossible to stop Black from building thickness, which is exactly what Black wants to do with his hoshi in the lower right corner.

White would like to play at both A and B, but can of course get only one of them. Move A works against the black hoshi, because a stable white group on the right side would neutralize the influence of the hoshi. Move B on the other hand would finish the white shape on the top. Maybe it's even a matter of style which one of them you choose. It could be that blocking at A is bigger, because it neutralizes the hoshi.]
(;W[qc];B[qe]C[Kalle: Black gains thickness.];W[pc];B[mc];W[nb]
LB[md:A]C[Kalle: Black needs to play at A now. White is then confined to the corner and all of his potential at the top is gone.]
(;B[pj];W[md]C[Kalle: This is a good cut, even though the continuation is a little difficult.]
;B[lc]C[Kalle: This move looks a little unrealistic, but black can fight back surprisingly well.]
(;W[ne]LB[me:A]C[Kalle: It's best to leave this forcing move unplayed for now, you should play at A directly. It's not clear whether this move helps in any way with attacking the black stones at the top. It loses at least one ko-threat if nothing else.

You might also want to play the forcing move from the other direction later, if, for example, your stones in the center end up being captured, and this move would only serve to make the capture bigger.

In general, you should only play forcing moves when you have a really good reason and they clearly help you in the local situation in some way. Sometimes forcing moves have to be played immediately, because you lose the opportunity otherwise. This is not the case here, see the variation.]
;B[od];W[me];B[jd];W[jc];B[kd]
(;W[kc]C[Kalle: This move is very bad. It takes away one of white's liberties, loses a ko-threat and forces Black to connect in a solid way. You really would have needed the liberties in the continuation. See the variation (move 32).]

;B[jg]
(;W[kg]LB[kh:A]C[Kalle: It's usually not a good idea to let your opponent cut you, so here you could consider playing at A instead of this move, and drawing back. You would let Black capture one stone while you make a wall. The result looks OK for White, see the variation.]
;B[kh];W[lh];B[ki];W[li];B[ge];W[kj]C[Kalle: Black was kind to give you this atari.]
;B[ji];W[jj];B[ii];W[mk];B[fb]LB[gb:A]C[Seems i made some not best moves here. Please show how white to deal here.

Kalle: Now you are in trouble because of the shortage of liberties. You have to give up something here. Maybe it's best to just play at A. See the variation.]
(;W[eb];B[hc]LB[gc:A]C[Kalle: This is a sharp move, exploiting your liberty problem. The atari at A doesn't work. Compare this to the variation starting at move 32.]
;W[hb];B[fd];W[gc];B[fc]LB[gb:A]C[Kalle: You should just play at A. This gives your group eyes, and still threatens to rescue the five stones on the left later.]
(;W[fe]C[Kalle: This move is really dangerous, it gives Black a chance to kill your whole group. See the variation for Black's next move.]
(;B[ee];W[fa];B[ff];W[gb]LB[cn:A]C[Kalle: You got a good result after move 62, but now you're forced to play this gote move. Black shouldn't answer this, but play an approach move at A instead.]
;B[fe];W[ck]LB[cm:A]C[Kalle: A good tenuki! Black has a lot of thickness around here though, so you should play more cautiously around A, but the direction is right.]
;B[ea]
(;W[ga]C[Kalle: This is really small, you should continue on the lower side!]
;B[da]C[Kalle: Black lets you take sente.];W[pl]C[Kalle: This is also an interesting direction, but I feel the lower side is the most important now.]
;B[fq];W[iq];B[dr];W[fo]C[I guess C3 better. Right?

Kalle: Yes, C3 would put more pressure on the black stones and is also bigger for territory. This move is very center oriented, but your center is quite open, so the corner is more important.]
;B[cq];W[cp];B[lq]
(;W[nq]LB[qp:A]C[Kalle: This invasion is very aggressive. I think you should enter at the 3-3 point or play a tsuke at A instead of this.]
;B[np];W[mp];B[mq];W[op];B[no]
(;W[oo]LB[oq:A]C[Can you show how white should play here?

Kalle: It's really difficult to get a reasonable result from here at this point. When Black next plays at A, the white shape is really fragmented. You could connect at A yourself instead of this move, but then you're confined to the corner.]
;B[oq];W[pq];B[nr]
(;W[pr]LB[qp:A]TR[oo][op]C[Kalle: This move is unrealistic. You need to sacrifice the two marked stones by playing atari at A and take the corner territory. Black gets a lot of thickness, but it cannot be helped.]

LB[nm:A]C[Kalle: This move is better at A.];B[lp];W[rm];B[sn]

;B[ro];W[rf]
(;B[qq]LB[re:A]C[I think this move is unnecessary(eye vs no-eye). So for black better to move S15. Right?

Kalle: Yes. Black should play at A and it looks like the two white stones would be captured by that move. See the variation. The point A is also huge considering the top right corner and the security of the whole black group.]
;W[re];B[ph];W[og];B[of]
(;W[nf]LB[ng:A][pg:B]C[Kalle: Instead of this, you should play at A. That gives you a good shape without liberty problems, and is sente against Black's connection at B.]
;B[qd]LB[oe:B][pg:A]C[Kalle: This move looks sente, but it's a big mistake from Black. You can just cut at A directly, or play at B to take a liberty. Both are OK, your three stones are safe.]
(;W[rd];B[oh]
(;W[rj]LB[qi:A]C[Kalle: I think this is not the vital point. You should strike at A.]
;B[ri]LB[qi:A]C[Kalle: It's important to hane at A now to take the vital point.]
(;W[qj];B[qi]C[Kalle: Now Black can hope to get eyes.];W[ng]
C[Can you show how to deal with this group?

Kalle: It's still possible to try to kill the Black group. You made some soft moves in the following sequence, so Black got eyes too easily.]
;B[pg]LB[oe:C][rh:B][oj:A]C[Kalle: It's difficult to say what the best line of attack would be. Black has three vital points (A, B and C) for making eyes, and White should attack one of them next.

If you want to attack the whole group, you should play at A or B next. If it's enough to just capture the five stones near the top, you can ask at C first.

The point A seems to be a good place to start, but Black has some surprisingly good follow-ups for that.

Maybe the best continuation for White starts with B.]
(;W[oe];B[pk]
(;W[nl]C[Kalle: This move is a mistake, because the marked black stone activates the sequences on the right side, enabling Black to live by making an eye in the center.]

(;B[nj]LB[mm:A]C[Kalle: Now it's impossible to kill Black, and you should connect at A.]
;W[rh];B[rg];W[sg]LB[si:A]C[Kalle: Here Black should descend to A, but he misses it.]
;B[oi]LB[si:A][mm:B]C[Kalle: This sequence was quite succesful for you, because now you have a potential connection at A as well, so you don't need to connect at B anymore.]
;W[pe]LB[ch:A]C[Kalle: This move is big, because it connects your center group. If it was only for the five stones, you should play at A instead.]

LB[gi:A]C[Is there something interesting left for white?

Kalle: I think the best you can do is to play this one and then A, like you planned.]
;B[hh];W[hj]C[misclick, it was idea about J10-J12-G11.

Kalle: That's a good idea. Maybe you don't want to play the J10 atari yet, so you could save it for later and just play G11 directly.
