C[IDragon: ***** Hello every one!! I dont know what is my rank at all because Go is not known in my country and there is no human to play against around my self. So I am forced to play with computer. The sequence till 141 is done against computer 15 Kyu and the remaining play has been done against computer 1 Dan. (64% of game was against 15 Kyu) So I will be glad if you judge on my ranking and tell me what was my mistake to loose this game with only 1 point!! Thank you so much. *****

(Time taken for this game: 1hours and 30 minutes)
(Please tell me the mistakes which I havesn't asked and you have seen too. thank you so much.)

Mat:
Hi, I'm not sure I can provide a good ranking, as I haven't played enough recently to be sure of my own, but I'm roughly 13k at the moment, and somewhere around 15-18k sounds fairly accurate to me. 

The best way to find out is to play some games over the internet with some ranked players. I play on KGS which is very friendly, and there is a computer go room there with bots you can play if you want to get ranked quickly.

Overall I thought you played well at the very start and in the fighting towards the end, but could have gained more by focusing on more stategic areas during the midgame, and sacrificing a few stones instead of fighting to save them. With just a one point difference I can't point to a single mistake that turned the game, but hope you find my comments helpful :)]
;B[dc];W[cp];B[qd];W[qo];B[cf];W[oc];B[mc]LB[mc:7][oc:6]C[IDragon: ***** Please tell me what I should do against white 6. Was pincer at 7 a good move? *****

Mat:
Openings and joseki aren't my strong point, but I would say yes, since you have your enclosure in the top left to back it up.

If I were white I would consider 3 options:
* Jump out to the center, to avoid being closed in
* Take some territory in the corner
* Double pincer

The first two would make it very easy for black to build up a framework on the top while keeping the pressure on the white group.

In the game, white took the pincer, which prevents that, but black still has more strength in the area, so the moves up to this point all seem ok to me.]

(;B[qp];W[ck]LB[ck:12][qp:11]C[IDragon: ***** Im not sure of black 11. because It gave white a semi double wing formation. But any way black 11's goal was a shimari for Q3. *****

Mat:
White 12 is a very nice move for white, because it works well with his shimari in the bottom left. Black 11 seems quite small in comparison, especially since there is so little room to extend. Black can only really extend on the 3rd line on the bottom, whereas white can jump out to the center and form a large area.

I think a better move would be to either prevent white taking that spot, or do something different with the lower right that would help you reduce or invade the left later on. (See variations for 11)]
;B[ci]LB[pg:b][po:a]C[This seems quite small for black. White will be happy to jump out at e9 later on.

The right hand side is still very open so you will get the most value by playing there next.

The top is still unsettled, so a base in the upper right would help with that. The hane at a also seems like a natural way to stop white getting a foothold in the lower right.]
;W[ql];B[qh]TR[mc][qd]C[The distance between these stones makes me a bit uneasy.  White can make a lot of trouble here, and R12 doesn't impact the white group at the bottom much.]

Mat:
The two white stones are still stronger than the black stone in the middle, and they have access to the centre. 17 also doesn't do much for the group on the left, which was already very strong.

If you strengthened #7 instead, you can divide and conquer the two weak white groups. Black could then gain some influence towards the center from attacking one of them. (see variations)]

(;B[mq]LB[gi:A][kq:18][mq:19]C[IDragon: ***** I thought white 18 is threatening black's territory in lower right. so a two space extension to 19 was vital in my opinion. was that right?? *****

Mat:
The lower right can easilly live even if white takes this point, so I don't think this is vital. W18 does threaten to build a large moyo though. Somewhere like A might be a useful place to play to help reduce/invade this, while strengthening the top area.]
;W[ro];B[rp];W[hp];B[lp]C[This doesn't threaten the bottom left much. Jumping to n5 or n6 might be better as it helps contain the group on the right, and still allows you to move into the bottom left later.]
;W[qj];B[pi];W[nd];B[md]C[The light stone from earlier is starting to get heavy...

It might have been better to ignore this for now and play elsewhere instead. Taking a point near the center could be more useful.]
;W[ne];B[ng]LB[me:B][pf:A]C[Here you are pushing white into your weaker group, which isn't good.

White is probably going to escape here, so it's only worth pursuing if you can get something out of it. If you attacked from different directions you could either consolidate your territory on the right, or strengthen the two stones at the top.]

Mat:
At this stage the upper side is too important to ignore, but you could have focused elsewhere earlier on. The problem is you now have 3 large, disconnected groups which are not alive yet. This is very risky and makes it hard to defend them all. You need to be mindful of this before it gets too large, so you can sacrifice anything that is too much of a burden to keep.

Securing everything 100% is a mistake as it will slow you down, but you want to to connect anything that cannot easilly survive on its own, and minimise the number of weaknesses you leave for your opponent.]

[oe:A][ni:E]C[IDragon: ***** Was filling this Ko fight a good Idea?? *****

Wow, this is complicated. Let's examine the four main groups before you played Q15:

A looks fine;
B and C are fighting for survival;
D can live unconditionally but needs a couple more stones to do so (the crosses mark the potential eyes);
E could be surrounded, but has a lot of liberties

With the ko filled in, B now has two liberties, which are shared with C.

C only has one other liberty at M19, and if that is taken away, B & C are in seki, meaning neither can be killed unless the outer groups die first to free up some liberties. If this were possible, white would have the upper hand because D can live, whereas the fate E is more unclear.

Unfortunately for white, it would take two moves to occupy M19, so black can capture before white can set up the seki.

If you hadn't filled in the ko, and started attacking B, white could recapture it, gaining an extra liberty, which prevents it from immediately getting captured. If the ko remained in white's control, white has the edge in the capturing race, and can either capture or achieve seki, depending on whether black filled in one of the shared liberties or not.

This possibility seems very unlikely though, because there are no ko threats on the board that would be worth more than the fight at the top.

So my conclusion is that Q15 is the most sensible move, but you could get away with not playing it as well. Black should be able to kill white B from here and everything else at the top should live.]

C[IDragon: ***** I think playing somewhere else would make the marked groups a dead group. *****

Mat:
This isn't urgent, they're alive so long as the group at T12 can survive, since the T13 group can't atari without endangering itself.]

No harm in trying, but white is far too strong for anything to survive here now.]
