namuji [2k\]: hi
TheIdiot [1k\]: Hello, I'm TheIdiot with white
TheIdiot [1k\]: thank you for reviewing my game
TheIdiot [1k\]: I manage to win but in fact, I did'nt play so good and the 19,5 pts win do not reflect the beginning and middle of the game

(;W[ok]LB[nc:B][ck:A][ok:C]C[TheIdiot [1k\]: I hesitated between these three points
TheIdiot [1k\]: after the game, I thought A was better and imagine this sequence

Your instinct for A was better than game. This move puts no pressure on anything, its almost like passing! If you don't play A then a move around there will be nearly sente for black (this is why I suggested a different joseki).]

(;W[cq]C[TheIdiot [1k\]: I couldn't read far enough so i choose this move..

You don't really have a good response here, your shape was bad and you didn't fix it.]

;W[do];B[bm]LB[em:A]C[TheIdiot [1k\]: I think A is better for black there. Confine white and be albe to launch a bigger attack on the weak group

;B[rb];W[pf];B[pb]C[TheIdiot [1k\]: Does black need to play there ? I did'nt expected that move and was glad to be able to play again to capure his stone

Black does not need to play here immediately, but he does have to respect the fact that he has some bad aji here. Defending immediately is not a bad idea, black has the time and it will pay off later.]

Not really, by linking up you are increasing the size of your center. Black didn't accomplish anything here, he should have seperated you and made you live small instead of helping you connect.]
