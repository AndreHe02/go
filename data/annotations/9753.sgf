This move is nice. The only thing is: when you have a gun, don't forget to shoot.]

It's a good thing, I also suggest L4 here - it makes a better shape and threatens E7 group a little.]

I think the problem is C11: it's slow. White has succeeded in L15, R10 and Q12 - but how have you missed all these three chances to attack?]

(;B[bl]C[seems mandatory.
(LL)

Yes, it is.];W[dk]C[Let me stop and summarize here.

I see that you prefer a well-defended small territory, as you took four corners and made two more groups (G11 and L5) in this game. The drawback is: handling 6 groups simultaneosly is hard, and, while defending these 6 areas, you haven't had time and opportunity to expand them. Don't forget about creating big areas and active fighting, it's more promising.

Overall, your O9 was a nice reduction, and your L4 was well-timed, but later T17 became a deciding mistake worth not to repeat.

Thank you for the material!];B[ck];W[di];B[cj];W[ig];B[hh];W[ih]

It's the same, but White added an exchange T4 - S2 and got a little profit of it. So the version you played in the game is more natural.]
