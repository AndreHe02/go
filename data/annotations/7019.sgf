meysel:
This is a game I played as Black with two handicap stones at KGS, 30:00 and 2x30s. My aims: not playing too fast (i.e. using 30:00 before entering the endgame), playing away from strength and try to find moments when to leave a situation to play a bigger move elsewhere.

---------
hey7:];W[cd];B[pp];W[cn];B[co]LB[fp:a]C[---------
meysel:

Is attaching here a simple, good answer? Or should I play differently?

---------
hey7: Dont attach a weak stone,
it will will become strong.
at 'a'];W[en];B[eo]LB[fp:a]C[---------
hey7: at 'a'
----------
meysel: ok];W[gp];B[iq];W[gn];B[fq];W[gq]
(;B[gr]C[---------
meysel:

the idea is to connect the black stones. Is that possible in the first place?

---------
hey7: you can only threat 
to connect]
(;W[kq];B[mq];W[ko];B[mo]C[---------
meysel:

At this point I had the feeling to make the right moves. Not too slow, not too daring.
---------
hey7: ok];W[ir];B[hr];W[jr];B[hq];W[go];B[ec]C[---------
meysel:

Some games before, I would continue to play in the bottom left corner.

---------
hey7: right];W[dc]CR[jd]C[---------
hey7: bad attachment
---------
meysel: I take it, it is bad as long as there is a  black stone at Q16 only. If there is a white stone at e.g. 
at marked point, the move would not be so bad?

---------
hey7: Yes. If there is a white stone 
at the marked point 
the attachment would lead Black 
into a overconcentrated shape.];B[de]LB[ed:a]C[---------
meysel:

These moves I just saw in a kifu and decided to play them since they seem to be natural

---------
hey7: I would play at 'a'.

----------
meysel: yes, in that situation next time I would play 'a'];W[ce]
;B[dd];W[cf]C[---------
meysel:

In the kifu, 3-3 was played. Here not. I didn't know what would happen, and tried...

---------
hey7: May be your opponent has studied the same game as well :)]
;B[cc]C[---------
meysel:

...to play 3-3 myself. Expectation: Loosing in the corner but reducing eye space (?) and getting strong to the center.

---------
hey7:];W[db];B[cb]LB[eb:a]C[---------
hey7: at 'a'
forcing White to defend 
and Black gets an extension.];W[eb];B[fc]C[---------
meysel:

unfortunately, the nobi seemed to be forced, at least, hane was not possible

---------
hey7: consecuence of move #30.];W[fb];B[gb]LB[gc:a]C[---------
hey7: at 'a'.
Let White play on the second line.
You get influence 
that is superior 
to the small territory White gets.

Moreover, 
you avoid getting a bad shape.

---------
meysel: that makes sense to me];W[gc];B[gd];W[hc];B[hb];W[df]

who makes bad shape 
will be punished. :(];B[ee];W[hd];B[ge];W[ib];B[ic];W[ha];B[id]

I can not keep all stones. I decided to sacrifice the two at the top.

---------
hey7: right];W[fd];B[fe];W[ed];B[ih]C[---------

Let's get away from here];W[fg];B[gf];W[bc]C[---------
hey7: unnecessary

---------
meysel: I see that, they are lost already and big moves around elsewhere]
;B[kf]C[---------
meysel:

I want to play H-12, but somehow want to play this move first

---------
hey7: ok];W[jd];B[jc];W[ke];B[md];W[jf];B[hh]LB[jg:a]C[---------
meysel:

now I got nervous and make the bamboo-joint

---------
hey7: at 'a'];W[lf];B[qm]C[---------
meysel:

the one stone didn't look big enough for me to save

hey7: right];W[kg];B[qj];W[qg];B[qf];W[qi];B[qh]C[---------
hey7: avoid complications

meysel: right];W[qe];B[qd]C[---------
meysel:

zebra joseki? what is this? does it happen often?

---------
hey7: I don't know];W[rf];B[pf];W[rh];B[ph];W[rd];B[rc]C[---------
meysel:

is this stone necessary? I wanted to close the joints from the outside instead but if 2-3 not played, my territory would be devastated, or not?

---------
hey7: right];W[pe]LB[pi:a]C[---------
hey7: White should escape at 'a'

---------
meysel: good to know. I was wondering if white can get caught in this shape or not]
;B[oe]C[---------
meysel:

I'm fearing cuts here];W[re];B[pg]C[---------

but still want to close the joints];W[rg];B[pi]C[---------

meysel:

Six stones on the second row, in the middle... are they dead?

hey7: The white stones are lost.

and another at 'y')];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[rb];W[pb];B[ob];W[oc]

hey7: at 'a'


---------
meysel: ok. destroying from the outside];W[si];B[sg]MA[si]C[---------
hey7:The marked stone
still can make trouble 
as a double attack there.

---------
meysel: I take it, it will have a hard time to escape, since there is a stone at R7, but maybe the cut at Q10 makes it dangerous and I need to secure with e.g. O9 or so or close at T10.

---------
hey7: right];W[lc];B[mc];W[ld];B[lb];W[nd];B[ne];W[nb];B[oa]
C[---------
meysel:

I try to capture the three stones not before I am forced to do it

---------
hey7:  
you give White a forcing move 
that can he can use as a ko threat some times as a double attack :(]
;W[na]C[---------
meysel:

Now I am forced];B[qa];W[ja];B[ka]LB[kb:a]C[---------
hey7: at 'a'
there is nothing to win 
with this ko fight.


---------
meysel: yes];W[kd];B[ia];W[nf];B[hb];W[gb];B[sj]LB[nk:a]C[---------
meysel:

Is it necessary to secure this open end? Somehow I thought yes, but I am not sure.

---------
hey7: If you are affraid,
cover the cut, may be at 'a'
making a moyo 
at the same time.];W[ib];B[mb]LB[ja:a]C[---------
hey7: at 'a'];W[ja];B[kb];W[ia]LB[dj:a]C[---------
hey7: White should avoid 
playing theese endgame moves.
better  at 'a'];B[ij]C[---------
meysel:

I can play somewhere else, no need to answer up there];W[me]
;B[fj]C[---------

still no need, I think, and use the time I get

meysel:

He really let me live here!(?)];B[ei]TR[dh][eh]LB[lm:a]C[---------
hey7: It is always dangerous 
to have two weak groups.
White will try to separate them 
and you are risking to lose 
at least one of them.

Better give up 
the marked stones
and play  at  'a'.];W[gi];B[gj];W[hi];B[ii]C[---------
meysel:

I decide to sacrifice the stones to the left, since I seem to be alive at the outside and the connection is more important]
;W[hj];B[hl]C[---------
meysel:

with this move I wanted to increase influence and threaten connection at the same time]
;W[gk];B[gl]C[---------
meysel:

more influence, more threat, but I already gave up the group]
;W[fk];B[fi]C[---------
meysel:

this move is funny, since I was sure they are lost. It is a bad move, somehow, but I wanted to make him believe that I still stick with the group, or didn't give it up already..]
;W[ik];B[hk];W[gh];B[jl];W[dg]LB[qq:a]C[---------
meysel:

a move I dont need to pay attention to

---------
hey7: right
White should play at 'a' 
Maybe he will manage 
to get at least a ko in the corner.];B[jk]LB[qq:a]C[---------
meysel:

instead, connect all stones

---------
hey7: These stones are connected.

at 'a' to secure the corner.];W[ej]C[---------

another move that I dont need to answer

hey7: right];B[fm]C[---------
hey7: You are helping White ...


---------

from here I start to loose much I thought I already possess.

may be at 'a'.

Here it starts];B[oq];W[lq];B[lp]LB[mp:a]C[---------

meysel: yes];W[nq];B[np];W[mp];B[ec]C[---------

what a weak threat I chose!];W[kp]C[---------
meysel:

what should I have done to prevent this really bad shape?

---------
hey7: see move #204];B[fc]LB[no:a]C[---------
hey7:
forget capturing two stones.
your position is in danger 
and needs defence at 'a'.
