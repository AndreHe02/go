C[alaric: Hello, I'm alaric, and I'll be doing your review.  I'm a 15K KGS player.  I'll preceed all my comments with "alaric:".  Any time I use a japanese term for the first time I'll define it, if you are  already used to using the japanese terms all the beter.]
;B[dp];W[pp]C[YukiMitani [22k\]: hi];B[cd];W[pd]C[sturgis [18k\]: hi gg]
;B[ic]C[YukiMitani [22k\]: u2u];W[ed];B[ec]C[sturgis [18k\]: i have been having some connection problems]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ce];B[bd];W[be];B[fc];W[dg];B[ci]C[alaric: This is a bit close to the white position, which currently is pretty solid.  Their is no urgency in playing in the local area, so a tenuki (play away from the current tactical location) is fine here.]
;W[di];B[cj];W[dj];B[dk];W[ch];B[bh];W[ek];B[dl];W[bg];B[ah]
C[alaric: this is small.  If you are going to play you just make the solid connection at B11, or better yet just save this play for latter.]
;W[ag];B[bj];W[el];B[em];W[dm];B[cl]C[ya double, empty triangle= bad

alaric: atari (threaten to capture) at B7 would seem to work fine here.]
;W[cn]C[alaric: I'm not sure what white is trying to do, white's situation is much more precarious than blacks here, so threatening a fight here is bad for white.]
;B[co]C[alaric: D6 looks better here, if he connects then you can still get C5, if he doesn't you can capture, or pressure and leave the threat open.  Either way if you cut him off he dies here.]
;W[en]C[should i have saved that stone??

alaric: never worry about a single stone for the stones sake, only if the stone has a strategic value do you give it any concern at all.  It's worth 1 point, which is small even in the end game, there are much more important things to worry about now.]
;B[fp]C[alaric: White managed to take a bit of space away from black, but gave up the whole corner, not a good exchange.]
;W[fm]C[alaric: Very slow move.  There is aji (potential for trouble) with that stone there, but not enough to give up sente (initiative) at this point.]
;B[qq]C[alaric: Very early for a corner invasion, an approach from the outside at N3 would probably serve you much better.]
;W[qp];B[pq];W[oq];B[or];W[rq];B[nr]C[alaric: why not force with the atari at O2 here?  White S3 takes a bit of the corner to give you an easy escape to the left.  You don't take the escape, and you lose the corner.]
;W[nq];B[mr]C[alaric: Very very bad.  Go Proverb "Do not crawl on the second row".  You are exchanging a solid center wall for a one point extension.  Though at this point you don't have alot of options.  This is why you should have escaped with O3 the previous move.]
;W[mq];B[lr];W[lq];B[kr];W[kq];B[qr];W[rr];B[jr];W[jq];B[ir]
;W[iq];B[hq]C[alaric: Disasterous. You gained almost nothing whie giving white a huge wall.]
;W[hp];B[cq]C[alaric: this should be unnecessary with your current formation.]
;W[gq];B[hr];W[gp];B[gr];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[fs]C[alaric: what purpose does that serve?  The black group on the right is alive, you aren't going to connect with this move, you are just inviting white to push into your corner.  E2 would be better.]
;W[er];B[dr];W[es];B[fo]C[alaric: Small.  Look at the moyo (potential terrority) that white is marking off, you need to finish this quickly and start to decrease white's gains.]
;W[go];B[fn];W[gn]C[alaric: Both of the last two moves are thank you moves (moves were your opponent thanks you for making a bad exchange).  You gained nothing, but helped white complete his wall.]
;B[bn];W[cm];B[bm];W[do]C[alaric: White's move is extemely small.  Look at the huge open space on the other side of the board, and he's worried about creating a false eye and the potential for 1 point.  Tenuki here.]
;B[ep]C[alaric: Also small, this is worth 6 points in gote (lose of sente).  There are bigger moves to be made at this point in the game, and if you don't make them you will lose by a hug margin.]
;W[ds]C[alaric: Sente, but small.  Leave end game moves for the end game.]
;B[cr];W[eo];B[qm]C[alaric: Way to close to whites strength, he should crush you against his massive wall.  Given the size of his wall I'm somewhat at a loss as were to play, the walls influence stretches all the way to the end of the board.  Normally I'd play something like the O17 approach, but passiveness here means you lose.  Maybe R14, but that could get ugly too.]
;W[pm]C[alaric: Bad move by white.  Don't attach to a stone you want to kill.  All he nees to do is starve the black stone for living space, and make terrority chasing the weak group all across the board.  R10 would have been good here.]
;B[ql];W[pl];B[pk];W[ok];B[pj];W[oj];B[oi];W[ni];B[oh];W[nh]
C[alaric: White is playing extremely passively here.  Presumably he's content to turn his moyo into profit, but he breaks the go proverb "Do not push down on the forth row".  This is exactly opposite to what happened on the bottom.  Under normal circumstances black would just continue north taking 5th line territory, but he needs something bold to win at this point.  My score estimator has W+51.5 at this point.  I think that's a bit high, but black is definetly down a significant number of points, and solidying the lines mean you lose.  Maybe something like J13.  From there you can connect back at the top or the right, white doesn't have alot of support, and you may be able to snake in and destroy some of the white moyo.]
;B[og];W[ng];B[of];W[nf];B[oe];W[ne];B[od];W[qh]C[alaric: Bad move.  White has already forfeited the corner by his actions.  He traded all the space on the right for another wall, now he just needs to finish it off.  Capping at J15 looks good here.  Very passive, giving up many points to black, but retains enough to win.]
;B[qf]C[alaric: Good, split weak groups.];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph]
;B[ri];W[rh];B[qn];W[qj];B[qk];W[rj];B[rk];W[si];B[ro]C[alaric: You can kill the white group if you don't let it expand.  S14 is solid it seems to work.  T10 is a false eye, and T12 is false unless white gets two moves in.]
;W[rf]C[alaric: White now looks to be alive which leaves you in a very bad position.]
;B[qe];W[rp];B[so];W[oo];B[pn];W[on];B[qo];W[po]C[alaric: Bad move by white.  Q6 is unnecessary, but even worse S7 kills black.  6 in a rectangle lives, but black has an open flank at T9, so the standard defense won't work and black is dead.]
;B[rm]C[alaric: Good to be aware of the danger here, but T9 also saves the shape, and scores an extra point.]
;W[re];B[qd];W[rd];B[rc];W[qc];B[pc];W[qb];B[pb];W[rb];B[nd]
;W[me]C[alaric: Usually white wouldn't want to push down on the 4th row, but given his lead he can play the safer, more passive play here.]
;B[md];W[le];B[ke];W[kf];B[ld];W[je];B[kd];W[jd];B[gf]C[alaric: Black really needed to invade much much earlier in this game, but this is a pretty good location (although you aren't left with any other locations).]
;W[ge];B[hh];W[hg]C[alaric: White should not make contact with stones he wants to kill.  White has thick support in every possible direction.  White should just constrict black so that he can't build eye space.  Unfortunately white is in the rare situation where his moyo is so large that black could manage to be cut off and still survive.  I would have played something like H10 instead.]
;B[gg]C[alaric: Contact is good for black here, and there is some aji in whites left side formation, so this is a good strategy.]
;W[hf];B[fe];W[gd];B[fd]C[alaric: Good.];W[ff];B[ef];W[fg];B[gh]
;W[df];B[eg];W[fh];B[ee];W[de];B[eh];W[fi];B[ei];W[ej];B[dh]
C[alaric: Excellent play in this invasion.];W[cg]C[alaric: white is dead.  He should not be throwing good stones after bad here.  His formation is in dire straights right now as well he needs to set up a new defensive line to hold.]
;B[fj];W[gi];B[gj];W[hi];B[ii];W[hj]C[alaric: Very bad move by white.  J12 captures black, secures that formation, and mostly ends blacks invasion.]
;B[hk];W[ih]C[alaric: 1 move later than it needed to be, but correct.]
;B[ik];W[ij]C[alaric: Bad move by white.  Black connecting at J10 doesn't do him any good.  Black has 0 eyes and less space than the last time.  White should just play G9. This connects the weak left group to the living group above it, and further decreases black's room to live.]
;B[gk]C[alaric: Good.];W[ji]C[alaric: White misses the oppurtunity to protect the weak point at G7.]
;B[gm];W[gl]C[alaric: Wrong.  The white shape is now dead, white needs to turn to stopping the invasion.  H7 cuts black off from the open space and is sente.   Black is now alive, so white should just try to contain the damage.]
;B[hm];W[io];B[im];W[jk];B[jm];W[hl];B[il];W[fl]C[alaric: E7 is a false eye, and white can't win a capture race.  White should give up on the white group and try to salvage the rest of his formation.]
;B[jn];W[jo];B[fk];W[bl]C[alaric: Pointless, this is just throwing away ko threats.]
;B[em];W[jl];B[km]C[sturgis [18k\]: well done
sturgis [18k\]:   I never saw it];W[kl];B[lm];W[ll];B[mm];W[nm]

;B[mn];W[mo];B[lo];W[mp];B[no];W[np];B[jp];W[kp];B[hn]C[sturgis [18k\]: again  the play is killing me]
;W[nn];B[ho]C[alaric: You are just throwing away ko threats here.  You've have a very successful invasion.  You are now winning by a considerable amount, just cut off ability to invade and you win.  K17 is probably the biggest move left on the board.]
;W[ip]
(;B[lk])
(;B[mj]C[alaric: This doesn't serve a purpose.  Unless white makes a bad mistake you are just throwing stones into the middle of his formation.  There are still points on the table, take them.]
;W[nj];B[kj];W[jj];B[id]C[alaric: No.  The damage white can do with K17 is bigger than the damage you can do with J15.  Furthermore, when you are winning, all other things being equal, take the simpler move (K17).]
;W[jc];B[jb];W[kc];B[kb];W[lc];B[lb];W[mc];B[mb];W[nc];B[nb]
;W[oc];B[ob];W[ie];B[gc];W[hc];B[hb];W[hd];B[ib];W[ad];B[ac]
C[alaric: B17 here instead.  White doesn't have enough eye space, so letting him push up the A line doesn't hurt you.]
;W[bc];B[cc];W[ab];B[af]C[alaric: No.  The situation hasn't changed.  A15 and B14 and maia, and if white plays A14 then A15 is a false eye.  White has escaped out the side, but still only has 1 eye.  Black's goal then is to deny white eye space.  C18 is the critical point here.  After black C18 then B18 and B19 are maia and A17 is a false eye, and as such white is dead.]

[ms][ns][os]C[alaric:  White won by 18.5 (including komi).  The misread snapback cost you 35.  The failure to kill the top left group cost you 46.  If you correct either of those mistakes you win easily.  The big mistake you made was invading the 3-3 too early.  Then when white cut you off from the corner you didn't escape properly.  This gave you an extremely weak group.  To live you traded a massive white wall.  White was already playing an influence heavy game and this just added too it.  During your late invasion you played well, but you needed mistakes from white to get back in the game.  Altogether I think you played a better game than your opponent.

Things to keep in minde:
1) Don't invade 3-3 when you have an approach move.  Most new players massively overvalue the 3-3 invasion (both when playing the invasion, and when being invaded).  This is because they view it as taking the corner away from the other player.  The 4-4 opening is not intended to secure the corner, it's a center influence play.  When you invade 3-3 you trade a small amount of territory for a wall in a direction of your opponents choosing.  Often the correctly used wall is worth more than the corner territory that is too be gained.  A simple knights move approach is better in most situations.

2) Tenuki more.  Very often players get caught up in the local fight and lose track of the whole board situation.  Especially early, any time there is not an urgent need to play locally you should be looking at where else on the board you can play.  When you see alot of stones clustered in an area, and other areas completely underdeveloped then you should probably be tenuki'ing more.

3) Leave end game moves for the end game.  Very very rarely is it good to play on the 1st row before the very end of the game.  These are simply too small to worry about now.  If you play an end game move your opponent should tenuki and take sente from you.  As long as there are bigger more important moves on the board you should wait to reply to end game moves.  While not as bad, the second row should mostly be avoided early as well.  The second row is called the Row of Despair.  The player with  more stones on the 2nd row is usually the loser.  Look at your top and bottom groups.  You picked up a total of 21 points from those two groups (annoying the left that the top is connected to).  You played 39 stones to capture that territory.   This is simply not very efficient.]
