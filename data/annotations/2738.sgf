S> Scartol here. Email me at eric@etan.org and visit my 3D Go artwork at www.just-text.org/artofgo. All of my comments will begin with the S> mark.
--
S> Considering your opponent was 3 stones stronger, a 9.5 loss isn't bad at all! Still, considering the big capture (and the little one that followed), it's surprising to me (and annoying to you, I'm sure) that you lost. Hopefully I can provide some helpful pointers.]
;B[pd];W[dq];B[pq];W[cd];B[ec];W[df];B[cb]LB[jd:A]C[S> This is small at this point. I would flesh out my moyo on a larger scale with A.]
;W[jc]C[S> Notice that white takes black's good move. The resulting sequence...]
;B[hc];W[mc]C[S> ...lets white approach the corner, which she wanted to do anyway. This is known as a "thank you" move -- which black should avoid if possible. White gets to play in a spot useful for the stabilization of her group, and gets sente to boot when black responds to the corner approach.]
;B[qg];W[ql];B[co]LB[qi:B][qo:A]TR[dq]C[S> Hmm. Not a bad idea to get into that white framework on the left, but I'm always hesitant to leave white installations like this unattended. A move at A would probably lead white to play around B in order to settle, after which black could approach the marked stone at his convenience.]
;W[po]C[Carey [17k\]: I've noticed you've taken to attacking in the middle of a gap
quitereal [14k\]: yes
quitereal [14k\]: take note
quitereal [14k\]: stop the moyo
Carey [17k\]: yeah, I've been mimicing that lately
quitereal [14k\]: split it up as much as possible
--
S> Instead, white moves in to pressure the black corner.];B[rp]
LB[np:A]C[S> Taking the corner isn't bad, but it signals (a) anxiety about the corner and (b) a willingness to let the side go. I know we've been told that the corner is gold and the side silver, but you also have a black stone that's going to need support soon. I would have played around A.]
;W[qp]C[Carey [17k\]: you must be confident in your close game]
;B[qq];W[ro];B[pp];W[qo];B[lq]C[quitereal [14k\]: not particularly
quitereal [14k\]: i don't know joseki great


Question for reviewer: Was black right to ignore the cut at S3 here?
--
S> Sure, that's fine, Indeed, black got a decent result here. Be aware, however, that before black plays M3, white has some strong attacks around that spot.]
;W[gq]C[S> Seems weak for white. It's settled, but it's not very threatening.]
;B[cl];W[np];B[nq]C[Question for Reviewer: Was O3 the best response to this move?
--
S> Yeah, this is okay. White often follows up with something like the variation, in order to secure some outside influence in exchange for black's solidifying territory.]

(;W[rq]C[Carey [17k\]: he grammar speak good];B[rr]C[quitereal [14k\]: :P]
;W[sp];B[iq]C[quitereal [14k\]: good move];W[cj]C[Carey [17k\]: thanks
Carey [17k\]: like I said, I've gotten better at opening, but otherwise I've been sucking]

(;B[cq]C[quitereal [14k\]: yer not fallin for ladders are ya?

Question for Reviewer: Should black invade at the D12 area to stop white's moyo?
--
S> Well, this attachment looks to settle territory quickly, but I am inclined to invade as you suggest, mostly because I like to fight. I've proposed a few variations for you to explore.]
;W[dp]C[Carey [17k\]: well.. there was one time this week...]
;B[cp]C[quitereal [14k\]: heh];W[qi];B[nd]LB[pb:B][ie:A]C[S> Hmm. This is an odd move. It more or less invites white's severe response. If you want to pressure white, A is better (since it also gets you out into the center). If you want to defend the corner, B is better.]
;W[ob];B[nc];W[nb]C[Carey [17k\]: I can't decide if I need to respond there
quitereal [14k\]: on which side
Carey [17k\]: top corner
Carey [17k\]: right
quitereal [14k\]: you could do like an n16 but really the corner corner is flappin in the wind
quitereal [14k\]: i'm ready to give up k17 if it means getting the corner]
;B[bc]LB[pk:B][ho:A]C[S> Also pretty small. A or B is preferable. (A pressures white and B is a reduction move.)]
;W[bd];B[pb];W[md];B[ne];W[oi]C[S> White is building a big moyo here. Black should do something soon.]
;B[io]LB[ol:A]TR[oi]C[Comment for Reviewer: I (black) tried to put pressure on him (white) when he put pressure on me, rather than just responding to his every move.  If you can keep that in mind and let me know when it's appropriate and when it's not,  that would help out a lot.
--
S> Yes, this is good. But after white plays the marked stone, keeping her moyo on the right from getting out of hand is of utmost importance. White is secure in the lower left, and her territory will come in the right side. Get in there before it gets much bigger. A would make things tough for white.]
;W[lo]C[S> White continues to expand.];B[mp]C[S> Kind of weak. Surely you know how white will respond. So try to think of a more effective way to break into that zone.]
;W[no];B[nh];W[ni];B[mh];W[go];B[he]C[Carey [17k\]: tit for tat]
;W[mi]LB[lj:A]C[quitereal [14k\]: :P
Carey [17k\]: hehe... I said tit
--
S> Small for white. I would have played A.];B[im];W[jp]C[Carey [17k\]: I'm surprised we don't have more observers, being the only game in the canadian room
Carey [17k\]: by the way, good move
quitereal [14k\]: probably a good game in the english room]
;B[kp];W[ip];B[hp];W[hq];B[jo];W[jq];B[ko];W[ho];B[kq]C[Question: Was this move really necessary?  Even though it's in sente, it just seems small at this time
--
S> No, definitely not necessary. And white is foolish to go after that one stone at the cost of letting you into her territory on the right. Shame on her!]
;W[ir];B[gm]LB[ml:A]C[S> Now is a great time for an assault at A.]
;W[ln];B[kl];W[jm];B[km];W[jl];B[kn];W[in]C[quitereal [14k\]: more blood!]
;B[hn];W[jn];B[em]LB[ij:A]C[S> A is more helpful for capturing here.]
;W[il];B[ej]C[Comment: I (black) ignored his small plays to make bigger ones
--
S> Yes, good. Although you were able to capture this group, keep in mind that it's usually better to use the threat to capture in order to make territory, then let white live with no territory to show for the fight.]

C[Carey [17k\]: so... what kind of drink did you go to get? :)
quitereal [14k\]: :P
--
S> This move shows that white is now very nervous about the territory on the right. Use this and strike! The capture makes black's wall tremendous. A and B are both nice options.]
