C[MM: review of marimar-solovay 1997-10-23 by Mike Malveaux <mm@foxinternet.net>, "malveaux" on IGS, October 26, 1997]
;B[pp];W[dd]C[ marimar 26k*: have fun, and a good game!];B[pd]
;W[dp];B[jp];W[jd];B[pj];W[dj];B[qc]LB[qq:a]C[MM: Both White and Black, taking the star ("hoshi") points, have large, open frameworks ("moyo") of possible territory. Both are also vulnerable to invasions. B#9 at R17 decisively claims that corner, but I wonder if the lower corner, R3, with it's "double wing" formation, might not be more valuable?]
;W[gq]C[MM: Expands White's framework.];B[mp]LB[iq:a][lc:b]
C[MM: Solidifies Black's tentative claim to the lower right. Other good plays might be J3 or M17.]
;W[mc];B[nd];W[md];B[me];W[le];B[mf]LB[cf:a][gc:b][cl:c]C[MM: A pushing-crawling race starts. This kind of thing tends to give thick walls to both White and Black. If Black wants to invade White, say around C14, G17, or C8, it might be good to do it before White develops overwhelming strength in the center.]
;W[lf];B[lg];W[kg];B[lh];W[kh];B[ki];W[ji]C[MM: This pushing and crawling race is dividing the board into unequal areas of influence. Since Black's is smaller, perhaps this would be a good time to break off the race, and invade White's weak spots.]
;B[kj];W[jj];B[jk];W[ik];B[jl];W[il];B[im];W[hm];B[in];W[hn]

(;B[io]TR[jp]LB[ho:a]C[MM: Black #35 (J5) seems better as a diagonal play ("hane") to H5 (marked "a"). Black's stone at K4 (marked with triangle) makes Black at H5 ok.]
;W[ho];B[hp];W[gp];B[hq];W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[is];W[gr]
(;B[ip]LB[cf:a][fc:b][qm:c][qq:d]TR[jp][mp]C[MM: Normally this is a good and necessary play. In this case, with Black stones at K4 and N4, I'm not sure Black needs to defend against the cut at J3. I think Black #45 could be better invading White's weak areas (perhaps near C14 or F17) or defending Black's weak areas (maybe near R7 or R3). But if Black does not play J4, and White does cut at J3, the battle can get complicated; Black #45 at J4 may be best.]
;W[nc];B[oc];W[ob];B[pb];W[oa];B[pa];W[nb];B[cd]LB[cc:a][cf:b]
C[MM: Black is quite correct to invade this area. White has claimed the corner and left side only loosely, and it is potentially worth a lot. More common invasion points are at "a" or "b". Often, it is better for the first stone attacking an opposing stone to be at a slight distance, rather than in contact with the opponent's stone ("tsuke").]
;W[cc];B[be]LB[ce:a]C[MM: I think a solid connection at "a" (C15) works better here.]
;W[ce];B[bf];W[bd];B[ae]LB[ch:a][ci:b][cf:c]C[MM: I think this stone would be better at a or b (C12 or C11), or possibly c (C14). Black's group needs to stake out some space to make two eyes.]
;W[bg];B[cf];W[df];B[cg];W[ch];B[bh]C[MM: This is good for Black. The Black group can live -- making two or three points for Black (but also reducing the amount of territory White could have had, by ten or more points).]
;W[bi]C[MM: White sacrifices the stone at B13 as a reasonable way to contain the damage Black is inflicting.]
;B[ag];W[ci];B[ai];W[aj]C[MM: If Black now calmly connects his stones by playing at A12, then his group will be unconditionally alive with two eyes, and -- even though White seals him in at D13 and A17 -- his invasion has succeeded: Black will have made two points for himself, and occupied ab
out a dozen points that  otherwise would have been White's.]

(;B[dg];W[ah]C[MM: This most likely kills the Black group. If Black wants to save the group, he must win the ko battle at A11, then fill the ko at A12.]

(;B[eg]LB[fc:a][gd:b]C[MM: But Black may still be able to use the influence of these stones in attacking around a or b (F17 or G16).]
;W[bg];B[af]LB[qn:a][fd:b][ee:c][ef:d]C[MM: At this point, saving the A13 stone seems wrong. Doing so fills in one of the potential eyes Black had, if he were able to win the ko at B12-B13 and then A11-A12. He has also reduced the number of liberties his group has (from six to five). This stone probably would have been better defending weak Black territory (perhaps at a) or mounting a more credible attack on the corner/upper side (maybe at b, c, or d).]
;W[ef];B[ff];W[fg];B[bh];W[eh];B[ee];W[de];B[ai];W[bj];B[pg]
C[MM: Black seems to give up on invading W
hite's area, and plays to prevent a possible White invasion of the upper right side.]
;W[fe]MA[fd]C[MM: White feels threatened by the remaining Black stones -- sufficiently threatened to spend two moves defending against them. I think probably Black should have continued the attack here, perhaps at F16, instead of playing Q13. Black's dead stones still have enough strength that using them in a pincher attack on the corner could let Black develop enough strength to live on the top side.]

(;B[pm]LB[qm:a]C[MM: This is a reasonable defensive play, but there is still enough room for White to make life with an invasion on the right side (especially if White is skilled in "tesuji," or uncommmonly brilliant tactical play); so putting this stone somewhere along the third line (like R7) might be better.]
;W[gf];B[rc]C[MM: Black doesn't need a stone at S17; White has no good way to invade here. Black is right to give up on the group on the left side; but Black can still  invade at C3, and still should protect the Black lower right corner with a stone at or near R3.]
;W[cm];B[rg];W[tt]LB[cq:a][qq:b][fc:c]TR[qc][gq][mp][mc]C[MM: It's surprising that the players pass with good points to attack still (a, b, and maybe c). White wins partly because Black's invasion failed, and maybe partly because in the opening moves (the "fuseki"), White was expansive while Black was defensive. Black #9 at R17 defended a corner, but White #10 at G3 expanded White's moyo; Black #11 at N4 was defensive, but White #12 at N17 expanded White's framework again....]
;B[tt]TR[me][le][mf][lf][lg][kg][lh][kh][ki][ji][kj][jj][jk]
[ik][jl][il][im][hm][in][hn][io][ho][hp][gp]C[MM:  ... Then the pushing-crawling from #15 - #38 gave about half of the board to each player; but White's tentative grip on the edge was a little wider, and White's half that much bigger. This is reflected in the final score.]
;W[tt]C[ marimar dead @ E15 solovay dead @ A14 solovay dead
 @ B12 solovay dead @ A11 solovay doneThe game is over.  Final score:   White = 153 territory + 16 captures + 5.5 komi = 174.5   Black = 136 territory + 3 captures = 139White wins by 35.5.]
)
(;AE[fe][pg]C[MM: (resetting the board as it was after White #84 at B10)]
;B[fd];W[ed];B[fc];W[fe];B[ic]C[MM: With this, Black stakes out enough space to live on the top side, thereby creating more points for himself and reducing the number of points White has at the end of the game.]
;AW[hd][jc][kb][dc][db][eb]AB[hc][ib][jb][gd][ge][ec][fb]C[MM: This is one of many ways the play might proceed.]
;W[gf]TR[fd]MA[pg]C[MM: It is not hard for Black to make good shape and have two eyes. But of course, in pressing the attack at F16, and not playing the defensive stone near Q13, Black would have left himself open for invasion by White. Which is better? I'm not a good enough player to say with certainty, but I think that with Black's area already smaller than White's, Black has nothing to lose by go
ing on the offensive.]))
(;B[cq]LB[bo:a][co:b]C[MM: The ko threat must be something that compells White to answer it, not ignore it and fill the ko. In this case, White has weak areas where Black can make life, but White seems not to have weak stones where just two consecutive Black moves are enough make their capture inevitable. (For example, White can ignore a Black play at M16.) So Black might play C3; if White fills the ko (rather than answering C3), Black at B5 or C5 adds some of the left side to Black's claim on the corner.]
;W[cp];B[ai];W[ne]C[MM: White may choose to fight the ko, too.]
;B[od];W[ah];B[bp]C[MM: Another ko threat by Black, threatening to take over the lower left side...]
;W[bo];B[ai]C[MM: Black retakes the ko.];W[bq]C[MM: Play probably wouldn't proceed this way, but it was mentioned that Black has played only a handful of 19 x 19 games. So, for the purpose of illustrating how a ko gets filled:]
;B[ah]))
(;B[ah];W[dg];B[bj];W[bk];B[ak];W[al];B[aj];W[bl]C[MM: And now Blac
k has sente, initiative with which to attack another weak White area (like C3), or defend a weak Black area (like R3).]
))
(;AB[cf]C[MM: What happens if Black uses this move to invade (instead of defending at J4), perhaps at C14, and White tries to attack at J3?]
;W[iq]C[MM: Atari on two Black stones...];B[ip]LB[jr:a]C[MM: Saved the stones; atari on one White stone. Now if White tries the atari at "a", then Black simply captures above at K3, and all is well for Black. So instead...]
;W[jq]C[MM: White tries to run. Now Black is in danger: White at K2 or K1 would kill the two Black stones. Luckily, it is Black's turn...]
;B[jr]C[MM: Making an "empty triangle" like this (the stones at J1, J2, and K2) is usually quite bad; but in this case the other nearby Black stones, and the fact that the two White stones are now in atari, mean that Black can get away with it this time.]
;W[kq];B[kr]C[MM: As White runs for more liberties, Black must run too. The Black stones that were placed earlier i
n the game help fence White in, so that White places more stones but fails to gain liberties as fast as Black. White can't attack yet (see variation), so instead...]

(;W[lq];B[lr];W[mq];B[mr];W[nq];B[nr]C[MM: Black makes life on the lower edge.]
;W[oq]C[MM: As the battle spills into the corner, it gets too complicated for me to address, particularly if White is resourceful...]
;B[pq]C[MM: ... but Black has the advantage of a stone at Q4 already, and should be able to keep the line of White stones from developing two eyes.]

(;W[kp]TR[im][in][io][ip][jp][hp][hq]C[MM: White, desperate to save what is now a large group, may attack the six stones to the left...]
;B[ko];W[jm];B[km]C[MM: ... but if Black is reasonably careful, there shouldn't be trouble.]
)
(;W[or];B[ns]C[MM: (Without O1, the black group is dead.)];W[lp]
C[MM: Black still has weaknesses White can exploit, which allow attacks on Black's loosely-held right side.]
;AW[op][qn][qm][pm][om][nn]AB[np][no][oo][on][pn][qo][lo][mn]
;B[ko]C[M
M: I won't spend much time on this, because it quickly becomes too complex for me.]
;W[qk]C[MM: White probably has better ways of attacking the corner and right side than this hypothetical ladder ("shicho"). I just want to show that White can use the strength left in his dead stones (J3 - P3, M4, P4, P2) to distract Black enough for White's invasion of the right side to work. So, maybe protecting the cut at J3 (Black #45 at J4, as in the actual game) is the right thing to do in the first place.]
))
(;W[lr]C[MM:  If White tries prematurely to capture...];B[lq]
C[MM:  Black puts the three stones in atari...];W[kp];B[ko]
LB[mr:a][jm:b]C[MM: ... and puts them into atari again, capturing them, thanks to the stone already at N4. (If Black instead goes after the White stone at M2, then White may capture six Black stones by playing at K7. It is better to keep pressure on the four White stones.) So we see why White tries to run, instead of attacking.]
))
(;AB[cf]TR[cf]C[MM: Or, Black may choose t
o simply sacrifice two or four stones in exchange for starting the attack in another part of the board.]
;W[iq];B[jq];W[ip]
(;B[kr]C[MM: Since this ends with the initiative passing to White (Black ends in "gote"), it is not particularly attractive.]

(;B[cc]TR[ir][is]MA[hp][hq]C[MM: By being willing to lose four stones in an area where he is strong, Black may get a head start on attacking White somewhere else.]
)))
(;AB[ho]TR[ho]C[MM: If Black plays diagonally instead of the connecting solidly...]
;W[go]C[MM: ... it probably goes like this...];B[hp];W[gp];B[hq]
;W[hr];B[ir];W[hs];B[is];W[gr]C[MM: ... and I think this result is better for Black. Almost certainly, the cut at J3 is safe enough, and Black is free to attack elsewhere in sente.]
)
(;AB[ho]TR[ho];W[io]C[MM: ... but if it goes like this, that's okay for Black too.]
;B[ip]C[MM: White loses his cutting stone (J5), and in the process Black's shape has become stronger.]
