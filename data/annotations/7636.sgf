Pete: 

Hi Micah! Hope you find this review useful. 
In the end, I think you (black) lost the game because you did not take full advantage of the frameworks you have built on the left side and the bottom side. White went in there with invasions and you even though it had to run for live, you did not make points in other areas of the board. The top-right corner also needed to be protected against the 3-3 invasion. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
Regards, Pete];B[pd];W[dp];B[pq]LB[pd:C][pm:D][qm:E][po:A][qo:B]
C[Don't usually do this 3 - 4 opening on the outside so I don't really
know if it is particularly useful in this position.

PETE:
The main thing of the 3-4 is of course that it is usually approached from A and B. Since that there is a friendly stone at C, that is OK. You are inviting your opponent to enter your side of the board. Do you want to fight hard here? If that is the plan, then after your opponent plays A or B, you can respond with D or E and start a big fight. The stone at C will support your fight. 

But see what would happen if white goes there now and you choose a more calm joseki ...]
(;W[dd];B[fq]LB[fc:D][qo:A][hp:C][jq:B]C[PETE:
In theory better move is to enclose the corner at A. But at that point white could jump to C and get nice extension facing your corner enclosure. So it is reasonable not to try to enclose this corner too early. 

My online teacher has recently pointed out to me that when I played a similar fuseki, the stones at the bottom side of the board are all low. It would be easy for white to try to push black down by playing at C. It is good to have a healthy balance of 3rd and 4th line stones. For that reason my teacher recommended playing at D instead of this move.]

O4 better?

PETE: 
Depends on how you want to develop the opening. If you are looking to resolve the situation in this corner quickly, keep sente and move on to another big move (like A, B or C), then this joseki is OK. Whatever white does right now, you can probably ignore and move on. If you are looking to claim some more presence on the bottom side, then yes, playing at D would be better.]

This move is too slow. I think move at A is better as it secures the corner more. But either way you lost sente -- so was the move at B too early perhaps? I think you could play the move from B at C -- force white to respond while you build some more presence on the bottom side. That might also pave the ground for approach at D later. Move at E also seems bigger than B. 
Also, think about it this way:  If you never played B, white would never do that 1-point jump and you would have opportunity to go in at F or G.]
;W[jd]LB[qc:C][pd:A][qe:D][pg:B]C[PETE:
This hurts black because stones at A and B are oriented to being used in fight (influence). White just reduced blacks influence by a lot. Because B is far away from A, invasion at C is easy now. White could even start by playing at D, I think .. try to split black or get bigger corner.]

I'm pretty sure black can go down to A instead. If white responds by saving the stone (e.g extending to B), black will kill the 4 white stones and try to find a way to attack the two stones attached to his awesome wall.]

This is an end-game move. Too early for that. Lots of biger points on the board. Think about playing at A -- the moyo looks AWESOME. Moves at B and C look fantastic as well.]

(;B[dm]LB[dn:A]C[PETE: 

This is like: a criminal just walked into your home and wants to take your stuff and you turn your back on him and say, I'll be right back, I have to finish doing the dishes :) The stone at A is not important at all. If white was silly enough to try to save it NOW, he would have to deal with trying to save two weak groups of stones. Black would allow one to live while killing the other and winning the game. 

Your attension should be on the criminal. How to attack him is #1 priority. While making this attack (you might not kill him), you should gain something in return (take his wallet and spend his money some place else. In this particular scenario I would probably try press white as low as possible, make him live very small and buld massive influence using a solid wall that spans from top left corner all the way to the bottom of the board. Do you see it? You just have to put in the bricks! See variation.]
;W[bg];B[bf];W[ch];B[cg];W[di];B[eh];W[ef];B[dg];W[ek]C[PETE:
White looks safe (at least one eye plus miai of either getting second eye or getting out into the center. Blacks influence from the bottom-left corner is going to be gone if white jumps out to the center.]
;B[de]LB[gk:A]C[PETE: white should ignore this move and play at A (also a laddeer breaker).]

;W[lq]C[PETE: notice that white has no cut-points to worry about.]
;B[jq]LB[gk:A]C[PETE: white does not have to worry about any cut-points, only needs to worry about running out. Now you can see that ealier move at A (or having black build bigger, stronger wall around point A) would be very very big - the 4 white stones that invaded the bottom would have nowhere to run to. If white played at A earlier, the invading stones would have easier time now. So A is a huge point it turns out.]

PETE: yes, way too early. Better moves would be at A, B or C. You could even peep at D and get continue chasing white out for a while. If black makes his marked stones stronger, he will be 1) safer and 2) can attack better at C. See variation.]

[cn:D]C[PETE:
This result is not bad for black. White should not skip playing at A because black will play there and that would be a very nice attack+extend move. So in theory black still has sente and could play another big move at B, C or D. So you might ask -- "OK .. why is this bad?". Answer is: it is not bad -- just limits your options in the bottom right corner. The situation is settled. White got some territory and black got some influence along the bottom side. The only thing that was lost here for both sides is keeping options open for later. Black also needs to remember that white just gained a nice move possibility at E. 

So to large extend the choice of this joseki vs the move in the real game is a matter of:
1. What is your overall plan considering you already have presence in 3 corners. Some form of a plan should be in your mind already.
2. Are you happier keeping things simple and reducing complexity of magnitude of options and diretions the game can take on? There are many professionals that prefer solid josekis and taking care of their shapes till the end. Thehy don't want uncertain situations. Lee Changho is a perfect example.]

C[PETE: 
Now white has fairly solid position and can aim at an excellent extension from his position to A. This move would serve two purposes: extension for white (more safe + territory) and perfect corner approach/attack on black. If the black stone in top right corner was at B, white would not have such a great possibility any more. Because the natural approach move would be from C. 

So I would be very careful choosing this Joseki. The top-right corner stone is aligned for a fight (it has more influence than territory) -- so use it in a fight. Don't let white settle easily like in this variation.]
