AB[dd][pd][dp]C[-- Hello, my name is Sven and I´m about 9 kyu at Dragon Go Server and around 12 kyu at KGS.
My comments are all preceded by "--" and I hope they will provide a little bit of help to you.

In summary, you played and won a good game without major reading mistakes (so far as I can see). What made you lose your handicap bonus but for 0.5 points was the strategical aspect of the game: Most of your moves in the opening and early middle game aimed at gaining and defending territory and ended in gote. Instead you should look for forcing moves which prevent your opponent from getting sente and build larger moyos (influence) for yourself. 
As concerns the endgame I´ve noticed only minor mistakes (well, this can add up, of course) and there were virtually no changes in the result from move 170 on.


gcc:
  I was white in this game, while black
  was gnugo 3.6, playing at level 10.

  Looking at the game afterwards, I see
  two areas where I probably need the
  most help:

  1. Opening - I've heard that each move
  in the opening is worth about
  15 points (2xkomi), and although black
  comes out slightly ahead, you would
  hardly believe from the game position at
  move 24, that I started with a 3 stone
  advantage!

  2. Endgame - nothing very special
  happened in the middle game, and black
  maintined a lead of about 20 points until
  the endgame. The result was jigo.
  I lost 8 points through a simple mistake
  (failing to respond to W91),
  but I hope you can tell me where
  the rest of the points vanished.

  Thanks in advance for your comments!];W[oq]
