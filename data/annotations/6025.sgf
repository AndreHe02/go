> Hi, I am Geza reviewing your game. I'll precede my comments with '>'.

A couple of general comments:

I have made a few comments on white's moves as well.

Both of you tended to play out fights to the last point even when there were bigger moves on the board. Realizing when to tenuki is very important: always look at the whole board before making a move.

Sente is equally important. This of course relates to the previous point. You don't always have to answer your opponent's move if you have something that threatens him in a bigger way.

I inserted many variations, sometimes my comments are in there. When there is no comment in the variation, think of it as what "might have been."

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Have fun playing go.
