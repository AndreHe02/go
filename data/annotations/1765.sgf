C[zapbop - This is a game played on igs on January 2, 2002.  I play black and manage to build a fairly sizable lead early, but it slowly seems to evaporate and ultimately i lose.  I would appreciate comments on the fuseki (which i have been trying to study and understand) and middle game (which still seems to be a mystery to me).  But any comments are welcome.   Thanks in advance ,
Chris Masty (somewhere around 23k* to 19k* on igs)

Hello Chris,
   Looking over the game it was actually pretty well played.  You did have a sizeable lead for most of the game, and in actuallity, it went away with two minor mistakes that you will probably avoid with experiance.  I'll have a bit more to say at the end.]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd]
(;B[fc]TR[pq]LB[fq:a][qo:b][qk:c][pk:d]C[I think this is not the best corner to approach.  it is probably better to play a move that has some relation to the marked stone, as it is low and wants to be developed.  If you want to play an approach move at this point, 'a' would probably be a better choice.  See the variation.  also, other moves to consider at this point would be 'b', which is the old standard, or 'c' and 'd', which make the low and high Chinese fuseki, respectively.  See more about these patterns in "The Chinese Opening", by Kato Masao, or at http://senseis.xmp.net/?ChineseFuseki]
;W[cf]C[This move is not bad, although if I was white, I'd play something a little more aggressive given that you have left the lower right corner weak.]
;B[jc]TR[kc][qd]C[zapbop - this is an opening i have been trying recently.  i believe it is called the mini-chinese?
----
This is not the mini-chinese opening.  The mini-chinese opening would involve the two top stones moved over to the right one space onto where I have marked the board.  Also would tend to think that the low extension is bad in this case, as you are already low in the lower right, and it is generally a good idea to not be low on both sides of the board.]
;W[ci]C[This is an absolutely terrible move by white.  You got real lucky here.  He is extremely over concentrated and low.  I would tend to think that 'a' is a much better move for white, possibly the only move.]
;B[fq]C[Not a bad move.];W[dq]C[Another terrible, overconcentrated response by white.  Again you get lucky.  I would think a pincer by white almost imperative.]
;B[jq]TR[dq][dp]LB[hq:a][ip:b][cn:c][cm:d]C[zapbop - since it looked so good on the top, i tried some thing similar on the bottom.  However, i have heard that this should at least be on k4 - something about alternating 3rd and 4th line plays.
----
I see two things wrong with this move.  One, it is definitely too low.  You are low all over the board, and although white is overconcentrated, your low stones have much less influence and growth potential as they would if they were located on the 4th line.  Reducing for white should be a snap.  Also, because of white's marked iron pillar, an invasion at 'a' is exceedingly easy.  I would consider playing this move at 'b' which would be more secure.  If you don't mind the invasion, playing up at the star point would be good too, as it helps out the corner stone in the lower right.  Also, breaking up white's position with 'c' or 'c' seem like very good moves to me.  on the whole however, your stones are in a much better position then white regardless of how low they all are.]
;W[cm]C[I think this is a poor move by white.  White has more or less sealed off the whole left side, but is now extremely overconcentrated and will have a harder time fighting on the rest of the board.]
;B[qk]TR[pq][qk][pd]LB[pk:a]C[zapbop - Maybe this should be at K10 to make a larger scale moyo?
----
Playing at tengen (K10) probably wouldn't help you much, as it would still be very easy for white to invade the right side of the board.  The three marked stones make up the Chinese Opening pattern, however, to balance out your low position throughout the rest of the board, I would strongly conside playing the last move higher at 'a'.]
;W[nc]
(;B[lc]TR[lc][jc]C[zapbop - both a tight pincer and i gain some territory on the top side
----
The marked stones are very overconcentrated.  I would consider a different move.  Consider the variation as an example.]
;W[pb];B[qc];W[qb]LB[ne:a]C[I think 'a' would have been a better move for white.]
;B[oc]LB[rc:a][rb:b][nd:c]C[Okay, this is not such a great move.  It seems to greedy in it's aims, and just serves to give you bad shape in this area which white can exploit.  This mover would have been better played at 'a', 'b', or 'c'.]
;W[ob];B[pc]LB[pg:a]TR[oc]C[zapbop - i was worried about w playing here, but now that i think about it, maybe q13 better?  maybe even my original p17 was the wrong move.
----
P17 was almost certainly the wrong move.  You are right though, 'a' would have been a better move.  After making a little mistake like the previous move, I'd just abandon the marked stone.  Don't ever be afraid to lose some stones, often the result is beter then if you had tried to save them.]
;W[nd];B[mb]LB[pg:a][pe:b][rc:c]C[Don't even bother threatening here, there are much more urgent points on the board, like extending to somewhere near 'a'.  Realize that your threat to cut is mostly empty.  White can play 'b', exploting your bad shape, and if you cut, I am pretty sure white could kill your 4 corner stones.  White could also play around 'a', and if you cut, white could start a complicated fight with 'c' in which he could likely either live in the corner or sacrifice the corner for a nice position.]
;W[nb];B[db]TR[pd][oc][pc][qc]LB[pe:a][pg:b]C[Now is NOT the time to be leaving the upper right corner.  Your marked stones have very bad shape, and white could exploit it directly with a move like 'a', which is sente, or indirectly with something like 'b'.  Either way, the fight in the upper right get's ugly for Black.]
;W[cc]C[Again, I don't understand why white submissively follows you with this move.]
;B[pg]C[Probably the most urgent point.];W[pf];B[qf];W[qg]C[The cross-cut is not so great for white here.]

(;B[qe]C[zapbop - should i extend here or play r12 or maybe q15?
----
Q15 would be much better!!!!  You have stones in this area, you can afford to fight a little more agressively.  q15 would aslo help your shape a bit.]
;W[ph];B[og];W[qh];B[oh]LB[of:a]TR[pf]C[I would have played at 'a'.  The marked stone poses a nasty threat to the corner, and the three other white stones are almost certainly going to wriggle away.]
;W[pj];B[pi]C[I wouldn't even bother trying to squeeze white, as he can get away.  It would probably be better to fix up the weaknesses in your own stones.]
;W[qi];B[oi];W[qj];B[pk]C[You have very little choice at this point but it would have been better to not be in this situation.]
;W[oj];B[ok];W[nj];B[oe]LB[of:a]C[This is okay, although 'a' may be a better move.]
;W[po];B[oo]TR[ok][pk][qk]C[zapbop - i wanted to let white live small on right side and build territory on bottom side.
----
A reasonable thought although caution is required lest your opponent grab the three marked stones.]
;W[on];B[no];W[pn];B[pp]LB[nl:a][nn:b]C[zapbop - maybe i should have tried to rescue my three stones with something like o8 here instead?
----
This move is a bit slack.  I would have instead
played 'a'.  'b' Might not end up saving ths stones in the end.]
;W[nk];B[qn];W[qm];B[qo];W[pm];B[nm]C[A good move, threaten rescue for profit.]
;W[nl];B[om]LB[nn:a]C[Probably not the best move.  White 'a' could lead to a sticky situation.]
;W[ol];B[rm];W[rl];B[rk]C[This is a bad move,  but you can probably already tell from the repercussions.]
;W[rn];B[ro];W[sm];B[nn];W[pl];B[ne]LB[jm:a]C[This move is rather small.  'a' is a seriously big moyo building move that seems crying to be played.]
;W[me];B[md];W[mc];B[ld];W[lb];B[kb];W[ma];B[rb];W[ra];B[rc]
;W[qa]C[the moyo builder at 'a' is still there.  That is a much more open section of the board.]
;B[le];W[mf];B[nf]LB[lg:a]TR[me][mf]C[Playing at 'a' is a much better move.  Your position would be thicker, and you would capture the marked stones.  your stones in this area need not worry, they are all connected.]
;W[lf];B[kf];W[lh]LB[mh:a]C['a' May have been a stronger move for white here.]
;B[lg]LB[mh:a];W[mg];B[mh];W[kg];B[ng];W[lg];B[jf];W[mi];B[ni]
LB[jm:a]C[don't even bother to respond.  That move threatens to gain white a couple of points.  Look for something bigger, like 'a']
;W[lk];B[li];W[ki];B[mj];W[lj];B[mi];W[jj];B[jg];W[kh];B[mk]
;W[ml]
(;B[ll]C[The peep may have been a stronger move here.  See the variation.]
;W[lm];B[kl];W[jk];B[mm];W[km];B[jl];W[jm];B[il]TR[lm][km][jm]
C[zapbop - i felt i gained a lot attacking the weak white group in the center
----
You did, although if white can make the marked stones live, it may not be worth it.]
;W[im];B[hm];W[hl];B[hk];W[gl];B[ik];W[hn];B[gm]LB[fm:a][gk:b]
[fl:c][hh:d]C[zapbop - i guess trying to save this stone was pointless
----
Yes, it's caught in a ladder, although when white responds with 'a', you could do something like 'b' to force him to defend  then jump out to 'd' to seal in whites stones.  Just because a stone is dead, it doesn't mean it is useless.]
;W[gn];B[fm];W[io];B[hq];W[fn];B[ii]C[zapbop- here i figured i could even kill the whole center group also
----
That is correct.  I'm surprised white didn't try a rescue earlier.]
;W[fl];B[ff]C[zapbop - is this the biggest move on the board or is something around m6 bigger?
----
Actually, I think this is the biggest move on the board.  Your opponent can't really punch in on the bottom side.]
;W[fi]
(;B[ij]C[Your opponent can't escape, so this is a wasted move.  See the variation.]
;W[lq];B[kp];W[ko];B[lo]LB[lp:a]C[This is a not the best response.  It would be much safer to just extend to 'a'.  Given that there is only a small point difference if you manage to protect here, I'd take the safety.

By the way, this is mistake one.
 It's worth noting that before this mistake you have a fairly sizeable lead.  After the mistake, I'd say it is a close game although you are still probably ahead by a little.]
;W[lp]LB[mo:a][ln:b]C[This is a fairly strong shape for white, your best bet would be to defend with 'a' or 'b'.  Threatening to capture just introduces more weaknesses in your shape.]
;B[jo];W[mo];B[kn];W[ln];B[mp];W[ko];B[jn];W[lo];B[jp];W[np]
;B[nq];W[mq];B[op];W[nr];B[oq];W[or];B[pr]C[This was definitely a big loss.  I think it made a difference of 30-40 points.  Sometimes it is just better to be safe then sorry.  But the game is still close I think.  The captured white group in the center is huge.]

;W[hp];B[gp];W[ho];B[eo];W[do];B[en];W[dn];B[eq]C[zapbop - i guess i was hallucinating here, should be at e4
---
Yeah, but us ameteurs tend to make these kinds of mistakes.  :-)  I've done the same thing many times.]
;W[ep];B[fo]C[zapbop - then i made it even worse];W[fp];B[dr]
;W[cr];B[es];W[cs];B[ds];W[go];B[gq]C[zapbop - 2 points in gote.  i suppose s13 is bigger]
;W[rf];B[re];W[rg];B[cg];W[bg];B[dg];W[df];B[ef];W[dc];B[cj]
;W[bh];B[ej];W[dk];B[fj];W[gi]LB[gj:a]C[Bad move by white.  This little foray shouldn't have succeeded.  If white had played at 'a', you would have been captured.]
;B[gj];W[ek];B[eb];W[hi];B[hh];W[gk];B[hj];W[da];B[ea];W[ca]
;B[de]C[zapbop - i thought white would definitely answer  this at c15.  i guess i could have just played e15 and held on to win the game, but i got greedy.
----
This definitely looks like a standard case of misreading.  It came out big, not much I can say, you just kind of stop making these mistakes after a while.

Bye the way, this is mistake two.];W[ee];B[ce];W[bf];B[bd];W[bc]
;B[ac];W[fe];B[ge];W[gf]C[zapbop - i did not see this move coming.  i think this is where i lose the game.  i thought a long time about my next move, but could not find any move that looked advantageous]

;C[This game is not actually as bad as it looks from the score.  You lost by 17 points.  If it wasn't for the two misreads which I have labeled, you would have most likely won by over 20 or 30 points.  I'd definitely spend a bit working on your endgame.  Believe it or not, despite whatever criticism I had of you opening and middle game, it is actually quite decent for someone around your level. Even when the moves were wrong, I can definitely see they had good strong reasoning behind them.   I'd also recomend practicing counting points to check the score, so you can get more of an idea of just how far ahead you are at times.  When you have a big lead it's often better to play conservatively so your lead doesn't dissappear like it did here.  Good luck with your game, and feel free to ask me any questions you might have about this review.  :-)
