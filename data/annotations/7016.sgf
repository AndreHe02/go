AB[dd][pd][dp][pp];W[fq];B[hq];W[cq]C[This may be best locally but it seems odd in a handicap game.

krv: Usual I play the same moves in even and handicap play. In handicap game stronger player usual have some better shape sense and his instinctive moves are better enough to win]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[dr];B[er];W[cr];B[eq];W[cn];B[pj]C[This is why I like the 2 point pincer in handicap games. My position in the bottom left hand corner isn't as think but I get sente to take another big point.

I think Q10 is the biggest point by a substantial margin as it works towards a better moyo than K16 as the left side is already occupied.]
;W[nq];B[lq]C[I played M3 because:
a) I would be happy if he ivaded the corner like he did on the othe side although I'm not certain whether K4 or K16 is the best use of my sente at the end.
b) I don't think O5 planning L4 is a good idea for White. I don't think he would be making a think position towards the center. I think he would just be creating a weak group of stones.
c) That leaves some form of double approach. As I am strong on both sides that shouldn't pose a problem.

krv: M3 is good, but I prefer L3 or L4 - to make K3 invasion impossible in the future.]
;W[pn]LB[oo:C][np:A][oq:B]C[The first big decision of the game.

The idea of O4 (A) is to attack Q6 on a grand scale. After 16. O4 17. N4 18. O5 19. N3 20. P3 my M3 stone has been weakened  but I have gained ground in the corner and in the attack against Q6. How does the weakening of M3 affect my lower side? I think the gains outweigh the loses. How do I handle 17. P3 which prevents my achieving magnificent shape? Rather than Q3, as I have played in the past when faced with this extension rather than the customary hane, perhaps P4 playing to seal White in. Yes, I like that here.
An alternative for White after 16. O4, mentioned by Rin Kaiho, is 17. R4 18. R3 19. R5 20. Q3, necessary because of O3, 21. Q8. I would actually prefer that White play this variation and suspect that he may hoping for 20. S3.

The idea of P3 (B) is to induce W O4 and then split the groups with P5. The P3 stone will be sacrificed after 16. P3 17. O4 18. P5 19. P4 20. Q5 21. Q3 but the corner remains Black's in sente.

The above may be inacurate as White has P2 which seems to make winning the ko a requirement locally. Being a handicap game Black has a number of big positional moves that require a response else White will get overran elsewhere.

The idea of P5 (C) is to split the white stones and to get into the center. It disregards the presence of the surrounding stones and seems inferior to both A and B.

O4 (A) seems better to me. Plus I have the game between Rin Kaiho and Yamashiro Hiroshi (B) from the 18th Tengen Title match analyzed in Tournament Go 1992 to draw from. Although White won by 3.5 points 9d Rin Kaiho states that White's play was 'a little unreasonable' here, plus I still have my undeveloped D16 and Q16 stones. Also I am not certain about the value of (B) in a non-handicap game.

krv: I don't like Q6 move, O4 is good];B[np];W[op]C[The ladder against B O4 doesn't work but because of the W Q6 stone the ladder against the W P4 also doesn't work.]
;B[oq]C[18. P5 sealing white in may be better.

After playing a few more moves I am now certain that 18. P5 would have been better. White lives small in gote and none of Black's groups appear weak.

18. P5 19. P3 20. Q5 21. Q3 22. R3 23. R2 24. S3 25. N2 and I don't see, at first glance, how White is prevented from creating a door position, but that's not bad for Black. This is less than White would have  gotten by invading the corner with 15. R3 and its GOTE.

krv: here the my favorite suji for white is wN4 - but it doesn't work here. May be this is because Q6 seems bad for me.
bP3 is good move - simple and solid.]
(;W[oo]C[I have three choices:

A) 20. Q3
  21. N4
  I have two choices:
  1) 22. N3 connecting
    23. O5 24. O2
    I would be nearly sealed in and White would have sente while I solidify ~25 points of territory.
    This might not be so bad as I already have stones in place that limit White's influence.
  2) 22. O5 fighting
    a)  23. N3
    I would get  ~15 points in the corner but I don't see where the fight benefits me.
    b) 23. O6 24. N5 25. M5 26. N6 27. D14 28. M4 and White gets to play at the top left again. This is O.K. for Black but I think there is better.

B) 20. O2
White has three choices
  1) 21. N4
    22. N3
    Black is a tempo ahead of A1 so White has a choice between keeping the N4 stone connected or playing elsewhere. This is obviously better than A1.
  2) 21. Q3 22. N3
  White has two choices:
    a) 23. P2
      24. Q2 25. O3 26. C5 27. B5 28. O3 29. any but F2 30. R3
    I have ~20 points of solid territory and a weak group to attack and White's compensation is that he got a free move somewhere.
    b) 23. R3 (some move to take the corner).
    White has ~ 20 points in the corner, significantly more than the normal ~7 points, and no weak groups. I have nearly consolidated the bottom and I have sente.
  3) 21. N3 22. N4 23. Q3 24. P2 25. R3 (some move to take the corner). Roughly the same as B2b.

C) 20. N3
White has three choices
  1) 21. N4 22. O2
      Transposing to B1
  2) 21. Q3 22. O2
      Transposing to B2
  3) 21. O2 22. Q3
      The only significant variation. 23. N4 24. O5 This fight would favor Black so variation C is the same as variation B while avoiding B3.

    So variation B can be ruled out as it is at best equal to variation C.
    I think whole board considerations make A a poor choice because of A2b.

  18. P5 instead of 18. P3 is something that I must study as it seems that White got more than he should after 15. Q6 and I don't think 16. O4 is the culpret.]
;B[mq];W[pq];B[nr]
(;W[qp]C[I think 23. R3 is better as this leaves Q2 as a relatively big point. 23. R2 would be better yet assuming that it lives.

krv: R3 and R2 produce some weak shape. I like Q2 here - this is handicap play and I assume that I'm stronger in life and death]
;B[jd]C[Q2 is sente but there are other bigger points on the board and it would be gote for White to defend as P2 is answered by Q2.

I guess not sente, W P2 Q2 R3 P1 and its White's turn.

krv: you may play Q2, but really better to skip it.
W P2 Q2 R3 P1 is territorial loss for white - however in sente :-)]

(;W[qf]C[0];B[qd]C[R15 may have been better. I didn't want to strengthen White's stones and have to fight with a weak group (Q10).]
;W[nc]C[Another huge overplay. I hope I do better against this one.]

(;B[oe]C[krv: I mean O16 here];W[pb];B[qb];W[pc];B[qc];W[lc]
;B[pa]C[Q19 is a small move but it is sente and it virtually insures the life of my group in the corner and as P19 fails I get to remove a bit of White's eye space.

krv: Q19 isn't sente - you are lucky white have answered it.]

(;W[ob];B[jb]C[K18 starts to make territory at the top while putting pressure on the White group.]
;W[me];B[og];W[qj];B[qi]C[So far so good. I think I have kept pressure on White's group at the top while building territory in the right corner and side.]
;W[qh]LB[pi:A][qk:B]C[B might be best but A keeps White sealed in and maintains my wall which threatens the White group at the top. It also keeps me connected and thick which should help prevent accidents which seems to be White's best hope as I am ahead in both territory and influence.

Still haven't found time for E7 or Q2. Wish I had a better idea of how big C7 is for Black after E7 if White plays tenuki.

krv: You have enough to win if you should just complete your territiory.
P11 is good.]
(;B[pi];W[ri]C[I can't see what my opponent is aiming at with the last couple of moves. If he was trying to use the aji to build territory I would have expected him to play S10. I don't think he can live under my stones and even if he can it is only a trade as I should get the area around R8 in exchange. Perhaps he is trying to create a few ko threats to make P2 a threat.]
;B[rj]LB[re:C][pg:D][rg:A][qk:B]C[His best chance at living looks like wA bB wC but at first blush I don't see this working as I have bD and I don't think it is worth reading out yet as I still think the worst that comes of this is a trade.

I have thought of another possible reason for my opponent's play; he could be trying to get in several moves on the outside in sente. This dosen't seem to be a concern as the White group at the top isn't under much pressure and I don't think he can't get much territory in the center.]
;W[rg];B[qk];W[sh]C[48. Q13 49. S15 50. R13 51. S16 52. S17 53. T14 makes miai of R15 and T16, White lives.

50. S16 51. R13, White lives.

48. S15 49. Q13, White needs two of the three key points to live but can at least make a ko, he can also threaten to escape or live like the next line.

48. S15 49. Q12 White either lives or escapes.

48. S15 makes my corner unconditionally alive which strengthens my wall so this seems to be the best move locally. When White lives it is always in gote so other than keeping more ko threats I don't see an advantage to playing tenuki.]
;B[re];W[pg];B[ph];W[of];B[nf];W[pf];B[rf]C[Now unless he can force a chink in my wall white is dead and didn't even get a ko. This tells me that one of us misread this position.]
;W[ng];B[oh];W[ne];B[mf];W[mh];B[lf];W[ke];B[lh];W[mi];B[li]
;W[mj];B[gd]C[White's stones seem to be in more danger than Black's so I played tenuki to secure territory.]
;W[jf];B[lj];W[mk]C[I've pushed from behind long enough, when White turns the corner I don't want him to close to my position at the bottom or to his stones in the bottom right either.]
;B[em];W[lk];B[jj];W[kk];B[jh]C[K12 not only guarantees that I can escape it starts to build some eye shape and, most importantly, it defends against a possible cut at M13.]
;W[il];B[pr]C[Q2 was played expecting R3 but if White chose to play differently I wanted to know now. I now can allow a White invasion if I later choose because I don't think the life of either group will be in jeopardy if I allow White to split my bottom in two.]
;W[qq]LB[cd:C][ie:F][cj:A][dj:B][cl:D][jn:E][es:z]C[The choice seems to be between A, B or C with D, E and F being weaker alternatives.

I don't see how White can win without Black making a huge tactical blunder. Safe moves should suffice from here on.

With the previous statement in mind I am playing C. It may be slightly inferior to A and B but it is safe and solid. It also threatens the huge move of C12 and poses White a difficult question, how close to my thickness is he wiling to play?

Regarding my C12 statement; after C16 Black can play any move from C8 to C12 if White doesn't play somewhere on the left. If he does I should be able to attack him for a bit and then come back to K6.

krv: I like B8 here - it aims at big territory on the lift side. Near E locally you can play at O7 - aiming to cut apart two white groups (but it is if you want to play).]
;B[cd];W[cg];B[cm];W[dn];B[en];W[co];B[dm]C[Giving White the choice of reducing or making a base, neither of which seems very profitable.]
;W[cj]LB[ej:B][bm:C][in:A][eo:D]C[A and B are the two moves that I considered.

I ruled out C once I determined that it didn't affect White's life.

Playing at A should get me 12 or more additional points at the bottom while making it difficult to attack my only weak point, D.

It is hard to believe that B would give me a higher probability of victory, especially since it isn't my only move to reduce the open area.]
;B[in];W[fo]LB[fn:C][eo:A][gr:B]C[I just couldn't get myself to play either of the cowardly moves A or B even though either one would absolutely guarantee the win. (B being significantly better than A).

krv: A here is weak move - if black plays A then F5 was succesfull.
I like G6 here.];B[fn];W[fr]C[As long as White plays locally I can't see any reason to look elsewhere as killing this group of stones makes it impossible to lose. Black could then pass whenever White plays gote and still win by 10+ points!]

;W[rl]
(;B[sj]LB[rk:A]C[S9 is probably better.

krv: R7 is better here];W[rk]C[krv: Your P13 group is strong enough to fight externally - like R7 or may be P8.]
;B[si];W[ql];B[pl];W[pm];B[ol];W[nm];B[nl];W[mm];B[oj]LB[ml:A]
C[N8 probably wins by more than 100 points but there is no longer any reason to play moves that require reading.

P10 threatens to live without capturing the stones, only of value if I can make life with my group floating in the center, and gives me a couple of extra liberties.]
