C[reid:  The usual premise for playing the avalanche
joseki is that white has some stones already in place
somewhere around l16.  Without that, it is probably
better to just play the usual hane at a.

The avalanche josekis are generally territory for
thickness swaps.  At this point in the game, it is
too early to know how white is going to use that
thickness.  If black manages to reduce the thickness,
then white will get the bad end of this trade.];B[cd];W[ec];B[db]L[eb]
[cc][df][cf]C[reid:  Hmm. Ishida (Dict. of Basic Joseki vol 2
page 24) lists a (e18), b (c17), c (d14), and
d (c14) as standard moves for black here.
My best guess why d18 isn't in that list is
in the variation...]
(;W[cc]C[reid: since black deviated from joseki, white
should not be trying to bring it back.  This
move is correct *before* black plays d18, but
not after :-)];B[bc];W[eb];B[cb]C[reid: now black is completely settled
and white needs to make another move.
So white has not done very well here...];W[df];B[od]L[mc][lc]C[reid:  yes, right idea for black. but maybe
even closer to the wall is better.  Say around
a (n17) or b (m17).];W[kd]L[md]C[reid: I think I'd be as severe as  possible
in this position.  I'd play white a (n16).];B[mc];W[cf]C[reid: black's  corner is too strong.  This
move is not sente!];B[kb]L[qo][cn]C[reid: too small for black.  moves  like a (r5)
or b (c6) look bigger to me.];W[jc]C[reid: too small for white too.];B[qe]
L[qd]C[reid: does this still leave some corner aji?
hard to say.  maybe better to hold back at  a (r16).  But even so, this is *just territory*
now.  the bottom corner moves are still bigger.];W[qc]C[reid:  there may be  aji in the corner, but
it's much too soon to try to invade now.
there are so many big points still to be
played...];B[pc]L[pb][qd]C[reid:  black a (q18) or b (r16) look like
better attacks.];W[pb];B[rb];W[pd];B[oc];W[qd];B[qb];W[pe]C[reid: white escapes! this is a bad result for black.
much better would be if black enclosed white and
forced him to live small (and in gote!)];B[qf];W[pf];B[qh];W[pg];B[qi];W
[dk]L[me][mf][qk][rd]C[reid: white abandons the field of battle!  better
to enclose black with a (n15) or b (n14) and hope
to be able to attack black on a large scale
with c (r9) later.  Note: black cannot connect
with d (s16).];B[nf]C[reid: ouch!];W[oh];B[oj];W[ni];B[qo];W[qq];B[pm];W
[jq];B[cn];W[gq];B[dq]L[eq]C[reid: a (e13) is probably a bit better.
black is very comfortable at this point.
since white still has a weak group (o11),
it will be very hard for him to make his
moyos work effectively.];W[er];B[bk];W[bl];B[cl];W[ck];B[bm];W[bj];B[al]
;W[el];B[mp]L[li]C[reid: white's corner (p4) is practically
alive already, and k3 has ideal living shape.
that means that n4 is trying to split two
living groups.  not an ideal strategy.

I would rather pick on white's weakness by
attacking at a (m11). black should be able
to stroll into white's moyos without much
difficulty.];W[nn]C[reid: good! this punishes white's mistake.
now black is cut off and without much in the
way of resources.];B[oq];W[pp]L[pq]C[reid: wait a minute! i thought  black was
under attack here, not white!  white should
at least block at a (q3).  pulling back with  q4 is too meek!];B[np];W[lg]
L[pn][mr]C[reid: once again, white abandons  the battle
too soon.  the black n4 stones are *not yet
alive*.  and white's q4 stones aren't too
healthy either.  I would play a (q6) to try to
connect to o6 in sente, then attack severely
with something like b (m2).];B[mk];W[nj];B[nk];W[kj]
(;B[mn]C[reid: hmmm, the  variation would be more
severe.];W[kl];B[pr];W[mm];B[lm];W[ln];B[mo];W[ll];B[nm];W[km];B[ml]L[nl]
C[reid:  this shape is not great for black.
better to just play at a (o8).];W[om];B[nl];W[pn];B[qn];W[pj];B[pk];W[oi]
;B[ok];W[qg]L[qj]C[reid: white seems to be behind.  perhaps he
needs to try something with black's bad shape.
white a (r10) would be pretty scary for black.];B[qj];W[en]C[

(;W[go]C[reid: this seems to  lead to a rather big
give-away.  see the variation.];B[gp];W[ho]L[hp]C[reid: even if you're gonna give  'em up, it's
still better to block at a (h4) and put up some
fight!];B[hq];W[hp];B[gr];W[fq];B[eq];W[fr];B[hr];W[fo];B[ep];W[iq];B[dr]

white has to hang on to almost the entire

assignment.];W[kf];B[kg];W[le];B[lh];W[mf];B[mg];W[li];B[lf];W[me];B[ng]

;C[reid:  By choosing the avalanche joseki in the upper
left, white seemed to be trying to force the game into
a moyo game.  But go is not a game that takes well to
being forced.  Much better to learn how to adjust to
each individual game (and opponent).  Try to be fluid
and play moves not because they lead to the kind of
game you like, but because they are good moves in the
particular position.  That way you will become an
all-around strong player, and your opponents will
have reason to fear you :-)])
(;W[gn]C[reid: white wants to seal his moyo, but he also wants to keep all his bottom stones.

falling  back a bit seems to work better.]
;B[gp];W[hq]C[reid: white is not worried about letting
the k3 group get cut off - it can live easily.]))
(;B[oo]C[reid: this looks  pretty hard for white.];W[po];B[pn]C[reid: white's corner is cut  off.  it
may even be dead as it stands!   but even
if white can live, black seems to have
about 60 points and sente.  it will be
hard for white to match that with his
moyo (there are still some thin spots
here and there).]))
(;W[df]L[cf][dg][eb][fc]C[reid: white played the  avalanche to get
outside thickness, so d14 is consistent.
If now black a, white continues with b.
if black c, white d is sufficient.]))
