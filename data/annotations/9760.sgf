;B[dp]C[I'm going to be doing a bit of self-review on this game.  I will be trying to follow along the guidelines in the Reddit Study Group thread located here:
http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/comments/35nczd/study_group_game_6/

Daniel: Hello!  I'm looking forward to reviewing your game.  I hope it will be helpful to you.  Thanks for leaving the self-review comments.  It's helpful for me to be able to give you more helpful feedback.  I'll indicate my comments in the sgf with "Daniel:" as here to differentiate them from yours.]
;W[pd];B[pp];W[dd]C[This opening seems very common at my level, opening on the 4 - 4 star points for both players

Daniel: Yes.  Quite normal.];B[qf]C[Daniel: Good];W[qe]LB[pj:a]
C[This isn't a joseki that I am familiar with.  I need to look it up to see if it is joseki at all and how I should have responded.

Daniel: This move is a small mistake by W.  It's refered to as the "kick", and is normally only good for W when W has a stone around A.  I'll include the standard variation from this sequence, which you should definitely learn.]

(;B[re]C[Daniel: This is okay.  I think that this early in the game, the other variation where B takes a bit more seems a little better to me.]
;W[rd]C[Up to here was joseki without realizing it]
(;B[rf]C[Daniel: This is bad because B doesn't have any potential for making eyes.]

(;W[pf];B[pg];W[of]
(;B[nh]C[I simply refused to push from behind, instead jumping back for some hopefully safe influence with the knight's move.

Daniel: Solid logic.  I agree that pushing from behind is bad here.  I think you still want to extend along the right side though.  You have a lot of weaknesses in your shape now.]

(;W[dj]
(;B[cn]C[preventing an approach from this knights move because it could be a lot stronger for white with the D10 stone present I feel

Daniel: I see where you're coming from, and that's true, but the other side of things is that with a stone already there, approaching on the same side is smaller.  An important opening principle is to play in the biggest undeveloped area on the board (unless there's something urgent to be responded to).  I think your move is too small with the bottom largely open and the top in danger of becoming a huge W moyo.]
;W[jd]LB[cc:e][fc:a][lc:c][qc:d][cf:b][qn:g][nq:f][er:h]C[Daniel: Yep.  W found the move on the top.  This is a good time to take a step back and look at the board.  B has sketched out a little more area, but W's is much more solid.  B could invade at a-e in the top and make a living group, but with W stones everywhere, B will get attacked heavily.  W's invasion points at f-h are much more appealing.  We discussed g earlier, which is nice due to the cut around p13.  F would allow W to settle easily on the bottom, limiting B's potential, and H is a possibility for a second invasion after G.

It's still a game, but I think W is definitely winning at the moment.]
;B[mf]C[My aim was to cut back on white influence and disrupt the control of the top portion of the board for white a bit.

Daniel:  Excellent!  You see what I was getting at on the last move that W has the top portion of the board well under control, and you want to do something about it.  That's a very good evaluation of the situation.  This exact move has some problems though.  Glancing ahead, it looks like W's response is correct, so I'll cover that in a minute.]
;W[ng]TR[mf][pg][nh]C[Daniel: The shape made by the triangled stones is often bad because knights moves can be cut, and poking here forces B to decide which cut to protect.]
;B[og]
(;W[nf];B[mg]
(;W[me];B[kf]C[Daniel:  Good.];W[le]
(;B[kg]C[bamboo shoots for safe shape

Daniel: Yep.  I think the table shape is a bit better here though, because it also puts more pressure on a possible cutting stone at N12.]
;W[jj];B[lj]C[Daniel: Good.  Helps protect the N12 cut.];W[ll]

(;B[kk]C[attempting to cut through here, I believe this turns out poorly for me in the end.  Is there a better way to try to reduce white's influence or cut these stones apart?

Daniel: Yeah, great question.  This is the normal shape move here.  The main reason it doesn't work out so well is that cutting these stones isn't super important right now because both sides can probably live with little trouble.  In my opinion, W's move at M8 is too small right now.  It doesn't do much of anything besides float out there at this point.  (B's area isn't well developed enough to call this a major reduction, and it doesn't really threaten to take any territory.)  I think B should ignore it for the time being.]
;W[jk];B[kl];W[lm]
(;B[km]C[Daniel: You're pushing from behind.  Why not play the knights move now?]
;W[ln];B[jo];W[kn];B[jn];W[lk]
(;B[kj]C[Daniel: Too defensive.  B can connect out either way.  If you have two options you'll be fine with, you don't need to play either one until your opponent takes one away.]
;W[mj]
(;B[mi]C[Daniel: Can W do anything bad to you if he pushes through?  It doesn't seem so bad to me.  Probably more important to attack W's shape]
;W[nj];B[ni]TR[nh][nl][mi]C[Daniel: What is the purpose of this move?  Any time you make an empty triangle, you should ask yourself "Did I need to make that shape?"  I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with it.  If you want to protect the cut at P12, just do so directly.  The triangled point is still the important vital point in this shape, especially now that W has O10.  Look up the "mouth shape" on sensei's library for a more thorough understanding.  Just understanding mouth shapes will shoot you up a stone or two in rank.  If B plays the triangled point, B is threatening to cut and denies W an eye.  If W does, W makes an eye.]

(;W[ko];B[om]TR[nl]C[white is gaining thickness, so I try to reduce eyespace and give my Q4 stone room to live.

Daniel: Good idea.  Unfortunately, not aggressive enough.  This mode practically asks W to put a stone on O8, making an eye.  You should just play O8.  The Q4 stone doesn't need support yet.  It's pretty hard to kill a 4-4 stone.]

C[Daniel: Good exchange];W[qh];B[qg];W[qj]C[Daniel: This last sequence here was the punishment for the weaknesses we talked about back at move 13.  One of the difficulties in Go is that often the punishment for a mistake comes much later so it can be hard to see where the mistake was.  Since you had weaknesses, W was able to threaten to cut twice in order to sneak along to the side.]

;W[ol];B[pl];W[nm];B[pm];W[ok];B[np]C[Daniel: W can live (see variation).  I think it would be better for B to tenuki somewhere on the left side which is mostly undeveloped.  The 3-3 invasion in the upper left is still open.]

Daniel: Great logic.];B[id]
(;W[sg];B[rg];W[lf];B[lg]C[at this point, I wanted to just ensure that white couldn't get in and save his other big group.

Daniel:  Fair enough.  When you're solidly ahead you can afford to play safety moves like this.  By my count, B has 35 points in the lower right, 27 from the capture above it, and 20 from the other capture.  Nothing else solid, but B should get 5-10 in the lower left corner.  W probably has at minimum 22 in the middle, and 35ish in the upper left, plus 6.5 komi.  So in terms of solid territory, it's roughly 90 to 65 in favor of B.  Lots of the board left to be played out, but B is definitely winning.]

(;B[tt];W[tt]C[Daniel: Alright, that's the game.  Thanks for submitting it for review, and good luck with your Go playing.

I think the most important principle you should focus on in order to improve, which should get you several stones of rank increase relatively quickly is playing in the biggest part of the board.  Two general rules of thumb to help there:

* Save endgame for endgame.  If it's only worth points and not about weak groups, and there's a large undeveloped or invadable part of the board, go play over there instead.  If your opponent really wants those points, let him or her have them, because you'll get two moves in a row elsewhere which will be worth more.
* First line moves are for life and death and endgame.  If you're playing on the first line and it's not to save one of your groups or kill one of your opponents, and there's still undeveloped parts of the board or weak groups, go play near those instead.

One other important thing to study up on to improve quickly is the "mouth shape".  I pointed it out a couple of times in the game.  Look it up on Sensei's Library.]

Daniel: Yes.  This is joseki.  Globally, I don't think it's the right joseki for this situation though.

1. It's very light shape, which is great if you expect to be attacked, but at least for the time being, W has no business attacking these stones.

2. It's a six space extension from Q4 to R11.  In general, five space extensions are good shape in the opening.  The six space extension leaves room for W to make a base inside (at A and B), but the five space extension does not.

One of the benefits of learning some basic joseki is that you can easily visualize the result on the board early and be able to make evaluations about things like five space extensions etc before playing.]
