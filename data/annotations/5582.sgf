C[[[ Hello - my name's Adam, and I'll be reviewing this game.  My comments are enclosed in double brackets.

I think that a review should teach general principles rather than just comment on specific moves, so here are the lessons I want you two to take away from this game:

1) Exploit your opponent's weaknesses.

2) Do not create weaknesses of your own.

3) Know where the territory is.

I'll be making comments with these three principles in mind.  Some moves which are not good I have ignored, because I don't want to divide your attention with too many types of advice. \]\]]
;B[dq];W[qd];B[pp];W[cd];B[od];W[md];B[mc]LB[qc:B][of:A]C[[[ A and B are the standard responses here. \]\]]
;W[nc]C[[[ Black, White has exploited your weakness and cut your stones apart.  However, in doing so, White has also created a weakness that you can exploit. \]\]]
;B[lc]C[[[ But, Black, you didn't exploit it!  Now White can play O16, separating your stones while at the same time repairing the white weakness! \]\]]
;W[nd]C[[[ Black, it's not good to let your stones get separated like this. \]\]]
;B[kd];W[jc];B[cf];W[ee];B[ch]C[[[ Try to jump as far as you can without creating a weakness.  C10 would be too far, because it would leave a weakness at C12, but C11 is fine, and therefore better than C12. \]\]]
;W[jq];B[hq];W[mq];B[jo]C[*Yoshi544*: i hope i can do better in this game

[[ Black, you have created a gaping weakness at J4. \]\]];W[oq]
C[Observing game 136 (pansan24 vs. Yoshi544) :
Found 0 observer.

[[ White, you have failed to exploit the weakness in Black's position!  Instead, you have played a move that gains you very little, overconcentrating your own position. \]\]]
;B[no]C[pansan24: i think you will];W[qo]C[[[ White, not only have you created a weakness at Q4, you have created a weakness that already has a black stone in it! \]\]]
;B[pm]C[*Yoshi544*: i don't think it is possible to do worse than yesterday

[[ Black, this stone has left a weakness at P6. \]\]];W[po]
C[pansan24: you could lose all of your stones

[[ Now White is in a position to attempt to exploit the weakness at P6. \]\]]
;B[op]C[*Yoshi544*: where
pansan24: doing badly];W[qq]C[*Yoshi544*: yeah

[[ White, note that you're leaving quite a few weaknesses for Black to exploit.  See the variation.  Of course, there's really no way out of some sort of loss after playing P3 and R5. As it turns out, the weakness at R4 is why White loses the game! \]\]]

(;B[pj];W[of];B[cl]C[*Yoshi544*: i have got some good influence on the center

[[ Yes, influence.  Not territory... \]\]];W[co];B[do];W[cq]
;B[cp]C[pansan24: my influence is small];W[bp]C[*Yoshi544*: yeah]
;B[dp];W[bq]C[*Yoshi544*: wait aren't we supposed to make moves slowly
pansan24: yes];B[ic]C[[[ Black, you have created a weakness at K16.  In general, it is a bad idea to attack with contact.  Now, when White plays K16, both your J17 stone and your L16 stone are in serious trouble.  If you had played at H17 instead, White could only strongly attack one of those stones at a time. \]\]]
;W[kc]C[[[ White, you did not exploit Black's weakness at K16!

I would like both of you to evaluate the board thinking, "Hmm, are there any weaknesses I can exploit?"  If there are, then exploit them!  Another way to put it is: Cut first, think later.  This is not always good advice, but I think that at your level it should be helpful.  After all, one of the key principles of go is: Keep your opponent's stones separated.  (And keep your own stones together!) \]\]]
;B[fc]C[*Yoshi544*: i finally thought of that strat
pansan24: haha

[[ Black, you did not repair your weakness at K16!  Now White has another chance!

Note that the rule about two-space jumps along the third line goes out the window when one of the stones is actually touching another stone. \]\]]
;W[ec]C[*Yoshi544*: i feel retarde
*Yoshi544*: *retarded

[[ White, you again ignored the black weakness at K16! \]\]]
;B[eb];W[dc];B[jd]C[[[ Finally!  Black, you have come away from this fight in a much better position than you deserved to. \]\]]
;W[ld];B[jb];W[kb]C[[[ Pointless.  It's too late now.  Remember, you want to split enemy stones apart and keep friendly stones together.  You should have split Black apart when you had the chance. \]\]]
;B[lb];W[he]C[pansan24: im glad we are having this game
*Yoshi544*: yeah
*Yoshi544*: it is fun
*Yoshi544*: with this muc time
*Yoshi544*: *much
*Yoshi544*: we can find good moves];B[cn]C[pansan24: yeah];W[dr]
C[pansan24: we act as stronger players
*Yoshi544*: yah];B[er];W[cs]C[*Yoshi544*: this may also improve our ranks]
;B[oh]C[pansan24: hopefully

[[ Okay, time to move on to the third principle I talked about: know where the territory is.  If you're going to play in this area, R13 looks better - it's easier to make territory on the sides than in the center. \]\]]
;W[rj]C[*Yoshi544*: we should have one of these games once a week

[[ I probably would have played R13, but White has the right idea: Black is trying to enclose the center, but it's very difficult to make territory in the center.  The easiest territory is on the sides. \]\]]
;B[lo]C[pansan24: most definitely];W[jj]C[[[ See, Black?  Suddenly your center territory doesn't look so large... \]\]]
;B[jg]C[pansan24: and not just against each other
*Yoshi544*: who else
pansan24: everyone else
*Yoshi544*: oh yeah when is that person going to start coming on that you taught
pansan24: im still teaching him
pansan24: but soon hopefully
*Yoshi544*: what rank do you think he is
pansan24: hes going to start on kurnik
pansan24: 25 k
pansan24: after three lessons
*Yoshi544*: cool];W[lg]C[*Yoshi544*: he has great potential]
;B[ki]C[pansan24: most definitely
pansan24: he just cant get over teh urge to kill all of the opponent]
;W[eh]C[*Yoshi544*: thankfull my cuz can't bother us during this game either
pansan24: yeah];B[ej]C[pansan24: your winning after all

[[ This move leaves a weakness at D11. \]\]];W[cj]C[[[ White, now YOU have a weakness at D11!  You can try to exploit Black's weakness at D9, but that's probably not going to work. \]\]]
;B[di]C[pansan24: a pleasant surprise
*Yoshi544*: you can still turn it around
pansan24: but i have a long way to go to do that

[[ By playing D11, Black has both repaired the black weakness and exploited the white weakness.  A perfect move.  White should have played here first. \]\]]
;W[hh]C[*Yoshi544*: finally one day that i am not off
pansan24: yeah];B[kk]C[[[ Black, you have created a weakness at L10. \]\]]
;W[jk]C[*Yoshi544*: crap];B[il]C[pansan24: wrong place
pansan24: ?

[[ Black, you have created a weakness at K8.  Don't attack with contact! \]\]]
;W[hk]C[*Yoshi544*: no
*Yoshi544*: you have messed up my center

[[ White, you have created a weakness at J9 (and, ultimately, H10). \]\]]
;B[ik];W[ij];B[hl]C[pansan24: its a weak invasion
*Yoshi544*: i know

[[ This is a very interesting moment.  Black, you said you were creating a lot of influence in the center.  And you were.  Look at how many stones you have to help you with fights!  So why not play H10?  I encourage you to read out the possibilities.  You will find one of two things: either you win, meaning you should have been more aggressive and exploited the white weakness... or you lose, meaning that you had a weakness of your own that you should be careful not to create next time! \]\]]
;W[gk];B[gl]
(;W[jl]C[[[ This is premature, because it doesn't exploit the black weakness at F9.  See the variations. \]\]]
;B[fk];W[gi];B[kl]C[[[ Black, don't you wish that L9 weren't touching the white stones so you could play K7 instead?  Don't attack with contact - it creates weaknesses. \]\]]
;W[jm];B[km]C[pansan24: and my stones arent communicating
*Yoshi544*: yah];W[kj]C[[[ White's exploiting the black weaknesses! \]\]]
;B[lj];W[li];B[mi];W[lh]C[[[ And it pays off nicely. \]\]];B[mj]

;W[jn];B[in];W[fi]C[[[ Why?  Don't repair weaknesses that aren't there... \]\]]
;B[kn]C[*Yoshi544*: i don't think this game is going to last 2 hours]
;W[qm];B[pl]C[pansan24: neither do i
pansan24: but its good that we have given ourselves time to think]
;W[ql];B[jh]C[pansan24: no pressure on our moves
*Yoshi544*: yeah];W[je]C[[[ White, you have a weakness at L15.  However, Black cannot exploit it yet because of the black weakness at J16. \]\]]
;B[hd]C[[[ Black repairs the weakness at J16. \]\]];W[fd]C[[[ White does NOT repair the weakness at L15! \]\]]
;B[gc]C[pansan24: i think im strong in the mid game
pansan24: and your strong in teh opening

[[ I think cutting at L15 is a little better. \]\]];W[gd]C[[[ Terrible move!  This does nothing for White, and now Black can break through at L15. \]\]

*Yoshi544*: who do you think is ahead

[[ That is a very good question, and you should ask it more often.

White is currently far in the lead, with the entire right and bottom sides, both left corners, and some center territory.  Black has two small pockets in the middle and some space on the top. \]\]]
;B[id]C[[[ Terrible move!  This is totally needless defense, and now White can repair the weakness at L15! \]\]]
;W[ie]C[[[ But White doesn't repair the weakness! \]\]];B[ke]
C[[[ And Black finally exploits it. \]\]];W[kf];B[le];W[mf]
;B[lf]C[pansan24: you for the moment

[[ White, that is incorrect.  Even with Black breaking through at L15, you are FAR in the lead.  You need to play like you're leading by a large margin.  Play solidly.  Don't take risks.  It looks like Black has 40 points to make up! \]\]]
;W[kg]C[*Yoshi544*: you can turn it around i bet];B[me];W[nf]
;B[mg];W[nh];B[mh];W[ni]C[[[ White, you need to save your stones with K14! \]\]]
