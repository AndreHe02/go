C[A minor point if I may:
it would be helpful when you add a comment after one by the player if you would leave a blank line so that your comment is obvious.  (I have put one in)]

(;W[pf]C[Again an apparently minor point: it is much easier to read if punctuated correctly.
  After a "." there should be 2 spaces.  One can see easily where the sentence begins and ends.  Sometimes the "." is an abbreviation mark, not a "full stop" (end of sentence) mark.
Compare these two versions, original then with spaces.

============================
JMR: This is with a view to being a ladder blocker for the joseki starting with White H3, BC3 ...W's Q14 is not profitable, if b respond with O16.  C3 is not bad for w.
One move back and cf var2.
There should be no comma after "profitable".
With the comma (and without the spaces after the "." to make the end of the sentence obvious) it seems at first to read - "W's Q14 is not profitable.
If B responds with O16, then ...
"Notice "I respond We respond You respond" but "He respondS;" or " B respondS."

<HK> I see.];B[qh]C[JMR Unfortunately this rescues the ladder ...Not unfortunate.The ladder is not so important now.JMR (Go question) Why not?

<HK> Even without Q14 the ladder is advantageous for white.


If black moves at O16 instead of R12 and white tries the ladder beginning from H3, black's ladder blocker P13 is very severe.  You have to try the ladder without Q14.
Regarding left lower corner you can move at C3,C10,G4 or G5 in accordance with the circumstances.]

(;W[qi]C[JMR Simply O14 might be better than this indirect way of preventing the cut, which gives me some kikashi but gives Black considerable useful thickness.HK W's R11 is not kikashi, because B's Q3 is at an ideal point.JMR (The kikashi I was thinking of were P11 and S13.  And I was trying to protect the Q14 - Q12 connection.)

<HK> Even if white has  the kikashi at P11 and S13 or S14, black's profit is too big. The distance between Q3 and the wall consisting of Q10-R10-S10 is ideal.]
