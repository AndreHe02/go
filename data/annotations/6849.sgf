C[Hello, dear reviewer. This is a game I played on KGS some time ago.
Our ranks were [11k?\] and [14k?\], but it really is 15k for both of us.
I am really interested in the opening part and handling invasions.

Hello, I'm Tom, and I'll be reviewing your game.  Your opening was mostly fine, in fact you had the clear advantage after the sequence in the top left.  The main mistakes you made were in responding to the invasion at move 140 and the reduction at move 190.  Remember when dealing with invasions ask yourself 2 questions: what does it need to escape?  what does it need to live?  As for the reduction, just keep practicing reading and watch for tesuji.  Probably the thing that will help you most is finding a book of life and death problems to study, to improve your reading skill.]

;W[ec];B[ed];W[dc];B[cc];W[gc]C[Emoticon: Maybe it's better to play at H17 or so. I was afraid of white getting the second eye in center, since group can get another eye easily at the top.

No, your sequence was correct.  It takes away the corner.];B[gd]
C[F16 is safer.];W[hc];B[fc];W[fb];B[fd];W[db];B[ic];W[cb];B[hb]
;W[gb];B[dd];W[hd];B[he];W[bc];B[bd]C[White has given you a huge wall facing your influence on the left side.  At this point, you have won the game.  Congratulations.  Now you just have to hold on to your terrific lead.]
;W[ac]C[Small.  Punish W by invading at R3.]
(;B[ad];W[bb];B[ho];W[hn];B[gn];W[hl];B[hk]C[Emoticon: I didn't like the fight that follwed here. There should have been a better way.]
;W[gm];B[gl]C[Note that a simple G9 leaves no aji for white to attack you.]
;W[hm];B[qc];W[gk];B[hj];W[gj];B[gi];W[jj];B[ii]C[Emoticon: Better at L10.

MA[fr][lr][ds]C[Emoticon: Maybe better at M2 or F2? Or, maybe, monkey jump at D1.

Yes, M2 is probably best, it captures and you have monkey jump options on both sides.]
;W[lo];B[lq];W[mp];B[lr]C[Emoticon: Same here, except for N2 instead of M2.]

;W[mc]C[The key to responding to this kind of invasion is to recognize that white must either:
1) live or
2) escape to connect to a living group.
In this case your huge walls mean white cannot escape anywhere, so your first priority is to keep white from getting enough space to make eyes.  I'd probably play K18 or L17, which cut down on white's space, and reduce the threat potential at J18.]

(;B[me]TR[ph][qh][rh][ii][ji][ki][ni][oi][pi][lj][mj]C[This move isn't necessary, look at your impenetrable thickness!]
;W[kc];B[kd]C[Emoticon: Was it this move that allowed W to connect by playing under the stones a bit later?

Well, you could have cut white off but the stones would probably live anyway.  At this point you should be playing underneath to destroy eyespace.]

;W[mb];B[qa]C[Emoticon: Now it seems unnecessary.

Tom: Yes, the stones are dead.];W[ia];B[ie];W[ka];B[bm];W[bn]
;B[sh]C[Emoticon: Now that I look at it, it seems that possible ko is not that serious, so I should have don something about weaknesses at the left. Is that right?

Tom: Yes, the ko is pretty small, I might play F11 or similar.  But really the left side wasn't that weak, you just made mistakes defending it.]

(;B[ek]C[This is where black gives away the game the first time.  White can ignore your attempt to cut, and play F11, ruining your territory and winning the game.]

(;B[rj]C[Don't bother with ko threats now, try to protect your territory.]
;W[dj];B[qj]
(;W[pk]C[Actually a bad move for white.  This kill is big (about 5 points) but a move like C13 is quite a bit bigger, as it generates big territory for white and ruins any hope black has of using that beautiful wall.]
;B[sk]C[No, this move is much smaller than C12, or something similar.]
