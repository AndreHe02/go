AB[dd][jd][pd][dj][jj][pj][dp][jp][pp]C[*h1029m*: Hi!

[[Hello. I'll put my comments in brackets like this. A few comments. on your initial thought.

1. You say that you should be able to win a high handicap easily if you played a bit better. Well, don't beat yourself up too much. Taking on 4k at 9h will be challenging even when you have gained three stones.

2. Nonetheless, you are right that in high-handicap games simply abiding by the basic principles of attack and defense will take you a long way, even if you are much weaker than your opponent -- but, by the time you've mastered these principles, you won't be 16k anymore ;)

3. I may emphasize a lot of different points in this review, but don't beat yourself up about them too much. At your level, playing and doing tsumego is much more important than trying to follow principles religiously.\]\]

[[A post-script. Having gone through the game, your play through the middle game was extremely good for a 16k, although with slightly better play you would have killed several of his groups. I made a number of notes on the endgame because you entered the endgame in a winning position but frittered it away with small moves and  pass moves. Moreover, there was an unsettled white group on the board until the bitter end. Great game! Feel free to email me with any further questions.\]\]]

;B[nf]LB[oe:A]C[[[This is called an "elephant jump" The A point is the "eye" of the elephant. The weakness of the elephant jump is that once your opponent plays A, there is no way to connect the two sides of the jump (unless you are able to capture the stones entirely.)\]\]]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[of];B[pf];W[og]TR[pd][oe][pe][nf][of][pf]C[[[This situation, where you have a solid line of enemy stones cleanly slicing through two groups of your stones, is called "broken shape". Generally broken shapes are very bad, and you should try to avoid making them. Broken shape isn't the same as being merely "cut" or "separated". When two groups of black stones are cut apart by enemy white stones, these two black groups are themselves usually cutting apart the white stones that have cut them! This means that both black and white have opportunities to attack each other's stones. When two black groups are separated on a larger scale (for example, in the way that black makes two separate groups in the variation to move 2) that can also be acceptable: because the groups are so far apart, they are developing different areas of the board, and it's difficult for White to threaten both groups at once. Here, on the other hand, every single move that W plays -- P15, P14, P12 -- threatens to do huge damage to both o14 and q16.\]\]]
;B[pg];W[oh];B[ph];W[ki];B[kj];W[li];B[lj]C[I'm wondering here whether it would have been better to create life in my top group rather than working so hard to keep him out of the middle.

[[At your level, you should try to save any groups that your instincts say are alive. It's fun and it's good practice. If your instincts say that the group is dead, save it for ko threats. Here my instinct is that the best way to play out the top side is to start with O17. He either needs to let you expand your corner a great deal, or let M15 live. -- In general, you don't want to "just live" unless you're sure that the will give you enough points to win. If, for example, you invade somewhere and just barely live, then the strength W gets on the outside from containing the invasion may be better than the points that B gets from living. Here, for example, struggling to live on the top might cause you an even greater loss in the corner. --- What's really objectionable about M10 is that you're "pushing from behind". N9 does a better job containing W.\]\]]
;W[cg];B[dg]C[[[Bad move. C13 is a weak stone, surrounded by Black influence. You don't touch weak stones - you attack them from a distance. -------- In a real life brawl, the more friends you bring to the brawl, the more likely you are to win. Go brawls are the same way. When you start a brawl with Bd13, White is just going to invite another friend to the brawl with Wd12, and the you need to invite another friend at Be12, and pretty soon you're both really strong locally. But that favors white! B doesn't need this strength, because he was a strong wall a few spaces away. B's new strength gives him nothing, while W uses the strength to live. Attack from a distance. ----- Here I think the best move is Bc15, which denies W eyespace while protecting the cutting point at d15. If there were no cutting point at d15, Bc11 would be best, shepherding W closer to B's strong wall.\]\]]
