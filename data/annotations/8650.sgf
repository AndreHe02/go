;W[fd];B[df];W[jd]C[It might have been more suting to have played a bit more defensive here. Both players are very agressive and here the 16th row makes the top terretory hard to defend.]
;B[qn];W[nq];B[qk];W[qg]C[The top corner can still be invaded by a B17 and the lever corner is also open for invation. The goal of the game in the begginning is to secure the easiest areas first. First the corners and then exdend along the sides. Here with your move R13 you go for side terretory before the corners are claimed for.]
;B[qq]C[Black already has the corner now. I would have pushed against black to build up influence and then exedended along the bottom edge. You try to penetrate blacks moyo instead of claiming the terretory thats left.]
;W[qp];B[rp];W[ro];B[rq]C[I'm not sure why I lost this game. It was an error not invading the left moyo in the beginning? Or the problem was elsewhere?

So far it's still quite even so there is no need for drastic measures yet. The lower edge is still unclaimed and the upper right corner is not secure yet.]
;W[qo];B[or];W[pq];B[pr];W[nr];B[oq];W[op]C[This is bad. Letting black cut at O4 is trouble.]
