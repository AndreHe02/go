(;B[hf]C[would g3 (move 7) and subsequent cornering the white have been the best response to the h2 invasion?
this is the wrong direction. even if you can counter this invation in the following way]
;W[gg]
(;B[eg]C[move 9 at e3 seems better than f3, which would not prevent connecting, but was there any better option?


[see variation\]]BM[1];W[fg];B[ce]C[move 11: maintaining integrity rather than attacking - how does the value of such decision compare in this situation?

this move can start ca complex fight. after white invation black's only hope is killing one of the two corners.]

;W[dh];B[eh]C[after move 21, was there any sure way to conquer the a1 corner, or was it already invincible?

Pls confirm if
* b8 rather than b7 would have done the job
* move 23 d1 followed by a2 would have been deadly for the white

Assuming I am right, I could have won the game! Is this true?

yes. b8 would have killed. see variation later on ...];W[bi]

you made just some reading mistakes, so not so bad for a 17 kyu : )
