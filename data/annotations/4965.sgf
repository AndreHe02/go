C[Thank you fro helping me. I was really lost in a lot of this game, I think that i really mucked up a lot of situations and could really use some input. Thanks again!

[DP The areas that stuck out were:
a) in the opening, the top right, where you could have attacked the lone white stone and taken significant profit.  Look for weak groups and put them under pressure - they don't need to be killed because you'll be taking profit anyway\]
b) in the middle game, assess whether a cutting point needs defending or not. This affected the centre fighting relating to the L5 cutting point
c) in the late middle game, not really knowing the score and so going for rash invasions when you're actually ahead.  Approximate to the nearest 10 points or whatever, but make sure you've an idea and keep it in your head
d) needing to appreciate when the endgame starts, and to go hunting for the double-sente points (i.e. they are sente if you play them, but also if W plays them against you) rather than meekly answering W

Hope this helps\]];B[pd];W[dp];B[qp];W[dd];B[nq];W[nd]C[[DP An invasion at Q10 or R10 would be slightly better to avoid B making a perfect extension at the same point. See variation\]]

(;B[of]C[[DP as per the previous move, would prefer Q10 or R10, then points around J16 and D10 become miai. This is still a matter of choice though really\]]
;W[hq];B[kd]C[[DP Good attacking move using the Q16 corner stones well.  Could also be played at K16, just as long as W doesn't have space to play L16\]]
;W[ic]
(;B[pj]C[[DP This is probably the first move I don't like - you've got a good attack going top right; continue with it. See variation for one idea, which completes the big points and leaves you with an advantage\]]
;W[kq]C[[DP Now W is losing the plot too - although this is not a bad point, sorting things out at O16 is critical. An attacking move like N14, getting out into the centre and putting pressure on L16 would be better. Also, D10 is clearly a bigger point\]]
;B[cj]C[[DP Good, this is a big point (although things remain unresolved top right)\]]
;W[lm]C[[DP This is a thankyou move for B. A simple response around P7 starts to turn the lower left into secure territory, and the W stone is not contributing anything especially as you've already played C10\]]
;B[nm]C[Is this too territorial? I was torn between this and attacking d16 or d4

[DP Nope, this is the right idea - the left side is still completely open and if W wants to encourage you to take a large territory, you might as well let him!  Possibly a little close - would prefer P7 for better shape and balance with the other B stones in the area\]]
;W[cg];B[cn]C[[DP Slightly more secure would be C7, aiming at the slide to B4 afterwards.  But since W answers at C5, you get the result you were after\]]
;W[co];B[dn];W[eo]C[[DP Bad move by W - this achieves virtually nothing.  B should ignore it\]]

(;B[lp]C[[DP ... which you correctly did.  But this is where you are getting excessively territorial since this is a small move.  Better would have been either the invasion at C17 or J15 again attacking the weak O16 stone.  It has no friends!\]]
;W[ql]C[[DP Another bad move by W - this is too deep into enemy territory and should be either a) killed or b) tortured and forced to live very small whilst you get strong on the outside\]]
;B[qj]C[[DP Good, avoiding contact plays (which are defensive) and cutting off the bottom edge from W\]]
;W[dc]C[[DP W taking territory now is almost admitting defeat.  Top left W is smaller than top right B area, and bottom left W area is smaller than bottom right B area.  Plus B has the strong C10 stones\]]
;B[kp]C[[DP Nice move, pinning W to 3rd line whilst separating him from M7.  You are a long way in the lead at the moment, and safe reasonable attacking moves like this are the best way to see it through.  Don't take unnecessary risks!\]]
;W[jp];B[jo]
(;W[ip]C[[DP This W move lacks fighting spirit.  Should be at J5, aiming to cut at L5 and fight it out in the centre\]]
;B[io];W[lk]C[[DP The L5 cut is very dangerous.  You should defend it solidly with L6, for example\]]
;B[li]C[I didnt percive the cut as really dangerous yet. These stones seem so weak, i was suprised they lived

[DP It's actually very difficult to kill stones in the centre since there are so many escape routes.  Your best bet is almost always to attack them in such a way that you are taking territory as they run away.  M11 isn't bad for this, since it is also attacking O16 indirectly, but something just a little lower like N11 would fit the bill better\]]
;W[mj];B[mi]C[[DP Beware the contact moves.  You're no longer attacking - you're defending - which almost certainly wasn't what you were intending!\]]
;W[nl];B[om];W[pn];B[pm]C[[DP This is good keeping the W stones separated\]]
;W[jk];B[ji]C[[DP Again good, indirectly attacking O16 which has fewer and fewer places to run to now\]]
;W[ni];B[nh];W[nf]
(;B[ng]C[[DP P13 would have been better. This contact move is allowing W to make shape with the O16 group\]]
;W[oe];B[pe];W[mf]C[[DP W now has a strong shape and L16 is looking a little forlorn\]]
;B[kf]C[[DP Correct move, but you've lost sente and been forced into it by using contact moves against the O16 stones\]]
;W[oi];B[qh];W[mr]C[[DP Small move by W - invading here might get 20 points or so, but the entire centre group is in danger and needs to run away with H9 or something similar like the cut at L5\]]

(;B[nr]C[[DP You've been taken in by W - the big picture is those centre stones\]]
;W[po]C[[DP Another bad move by W - as long as you keep him separated, and yourself connected, W will be in serious trouble\]]
;B[pp];W[he]C[[DP W knows it's a lost cause in the centre so goes back to trying to distract you by taking territory\]]
;B[od]C[[DP There is more imminent danger with the unprotected cuts at P13, N12 and of course L5. This is a small move when you could be doing other things like G10 for example\]]
;W[md];B[lc];W[qc];B[pc];W[pb];B[ob];W[ho]C[[DP and now L5 is critical (because this move deprives K5 stones of liberties) and has become the turning point of the game\]]
;B[im];W[hk];B[hi];W[gm];B[nj]C[This was just wrong, should have covered cut at l5 i think

[DP Err, yes!\]];W[ko]C[[DP Suddenly W is right back in it, since his centre stones are now safe and can be used to raid your lower right\]]
;B[kn];W[qo]C[[DP W lets you off the hook.  Capture L5\]]
(;B[qm];W[oj];B[ok]C[[DP Poor move, P8 or Q8 better\]];W[nk]

(;B[qb]C[Is thsi move neccessary to kill?

[DP For a clean kill yes, but you could ignore it for a big move and set up a ko fight - see variation\]]
;W[lo];B[ln]C[This sequence is all wrong too

[DP It starts correctly!\]];W[mo];B[no]C[[DP This is an excellent move, cutting off the R5 W stones\]\]]
;W[mn];B[mp];W[mm]C[[DP So, you lost the centre stones, but captured and secured all the bottom R - so not a disaster\]]

(;B[pg]C[[DP Small move - this cut is not dangerous\]];W[fg]
C[[DP ... and W gets a big point in return\]]
(;B[fi]C[[DP no - at this point there's no territory in the centre - you should be after the big sente endgame moves - see variation.  You should also have some idea what the score is at this point in the game - you are actually still ahead here\]]
;W[bi]C[[DP W starts nicking the big endgame points\]];B[bj]
;W[lq];B[mq]C[[DP You should shoot yourself for this one with things like B6, K18 etc, still available!\]]
;W[lr]C[[DP and W should join you for answering!\]];B[bp]C[[DP an overplay.  The simple descent at B6 is completely forcing. You've done this because you think you're behind - if you'd worked out the approximate score you'd have realised you didn't need to take this risk!  It plays havoc with the C6 group above which becomes very weak as a result\]]
