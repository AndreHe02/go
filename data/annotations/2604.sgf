AB[pd][dp]C[Hello Reviewer:
My name is philipp (phi)
I Played WHITE in this game.];W[qp];B[cd];W[ec]LB[oq:A]C[phi:

better to close the right bottom first around A(P3)?
I don't think so. Not because it is bad but you need to be more agressive in a handicap game.]
;B[df];W[fe]LB[hc:A]C["A" making a more stable group so that you can swithch after to another part of the board was better. Your group does not attack or defend. It does not make your group strong either. If you already had a position in the upper right then your move would be good.]
;B[ci]LB[jc:A]C[If I was black, I would attack by playing around A.]
;W[jd]LB[kc:A][lc:B][nc:C]C[phi: can I go any further (A or B)? Maybe "A" planing to play at "C"]
;B[op];W[oq];B[nq];W[pq];B[np];W[qn];B[jp];W[cq]LB[qf:B][qj:A]
C[phi: Too early?
Better to play around A(R10) first?
No! A is too close to your lower right group. B is a better way to handle the situation.]
;B[dq];W[cp];B[do];W[cn];B[cr];W[br];B[dr]LB[dm:A];W[aq]C[This move is too defensive. It is better to defend by expanding the group. Not limiting it to the corner. See variation! A move at C7 looks good to me. C5 was better than the move played. Even B4 or B1 was better than the move played. The variation shows why.]

(;B[em];W[cl];B[dk];W[mc]C[Too close to the other white stones to be effective and not enough presure to the Q16 stone.]
;B[qf];W[qk]C[Too close to your own position. "Stay away from strength!" says the proverb.]
;B[qi];W[io]C[phi: How to invade this big moyo?
I not good at invading moyos but I like the way you did it. The problem is with your previous plays. You have been too nice to black by letting him make so much territory and strength too. You are much behind at this point. Black could have taken the Left side in sente! (see variation).]

(;B[jo];W[in];B[ip];W[jn];B[kn]
(;W[jl]C[I dont like this. See variation!];B[pm];W[qm];B[om]
LB[km:A]C[this was a strange move by black. Now was your chance to play at "A" and make good shape.]
;W[go];B[ck];W[bl]LB[bm:A]C[this move does not defend properly. I have earlier shown what the danger was. Se the variation for what could hapen now. "A" was better for a defence of this group.]

(;B[pk];W[qj];B[pj]
(;W[pi]LB[ri:A]C[I would prefare "A" if i was to continue play in this area.]
;B[qh];W[dn];B[en];W[fo]C[This was no threat for black he should have answered at G3. See variation.]

(;W[hp]LB[ir:A][jr:B]C[phi: Better Invade directly at A(J2) or B(K2) 
No! See variation. As I said L7 was nessesary.];B[iq];W[hr]
;B[ir];W[cc]LB[cb:A]C[phi: What about A(C18)?
Would it have been better to play there?
I think yes. But the move you played];B[bc];W[cb];B[dd];W[ed]

I showed this at a variation on move 79.]
