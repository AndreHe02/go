C[Hi,

I (1d) played this game as Black against ichiyou (1d) on KGS... Please review this game for BLACK... I can see no obvious big mistake that spoiled the game that much... I resigned around move 200, I was far behind...

Please comment especially on how I could have made better use of my 3-5 corner stones... I cannot figure out, where I lost so much...   Thx for your time!!]

(;B[nd]LB[ce:A]C[Bommel:Maybe a pincer around O17 or N17 better?

SGF:  Yes. O17 is the first move I thought of, but then you might have problems -- look at the variation.  Also, B can consider tenuki and play 'A'.  Settling the top left before committing at the top right may be a more interesting way to play.]
;W[pe];B[pd];W[od];B[qd];W[oe];B[oc];W[nc];B[ob];W[md]C[White is always going to choose this variation, so the taisha is not a good option.]
;B[pb]LB[nb:C][lc:E][ne:D][qf:B][qg:A]TR[gd]C[This is the wrong joseki sequence. 'A' is standard.  However, this will take sente to do something about the left in exchange for permitting W 'B'.  Another alternative is to exchange C for D then maje a tentative connection to the left with E.  However, B will then have to suffer a W move at 'B".  All this shows that the taisha was the wrong choice here.  Another way to show that it was wrong was to notice that the triangle stone is high, so a low pincer makes more sense.]
;W[ne]
(;B[kc]LB[kc:B][lc:A][ce:C][cf:E][qg:D]C[Bommel:  Which point is more important? L17 like I played, or is the joseki move R13 better?
   I think the F17 stones need an extention, otherwise they would get under siege...

SGF: The problem is that this misses the vital point in W's shape ('A').  The top left is not complete and B has miai at B and C so perhaps it is not so urgent.  Playing D seems to be bigger.  W does not want to attack the top left from the direction of B because he is open to the top right.  So W would play E and B is now free to play here anyway.  What is really boils down to is that it is not interesting for W to play at the top, so it is not urgent for B]
;W[qf];B[rf];W[qg];B[ce]LB[kc:A]C[Bommel: Is there a better move to punish White for ignoring to play C14?

SGF: No.  But it is not as interesting for B to play here now that 'A' is on the board.]
;W[de];B[dd];W[cf]
(;B[cc];W[be];B[cb];W[ee];B[fd]LB[kc:A]C[Bommel: I think the whole exchange in the left corner is good for black, is this correct?

SGF:  It is ok, but W has sente and now 'A' is totally unnecessary,  The variation shown is better for B]
;W[qp]LB[qg:A][po:C][jp:B]C[This has to be wrong.  W has a moyo forming and this just invites B to make outside thickness to nullify it.  B is not particularly interested in playing here anyway because of W 'A'.  W should play around 'B' if he wants to play for a moyo to the left, or 'C" if he wants to limit the corner.  Once W has played this move B should be able to take the initiiative.]
;B[jq]C[Not enough.  Should be one point further.];W[fq]
(;B[pn]LB[qn:C][po:B][jq:A]C[Bommel:  Again a mistake I think... Keeping him low with Q5 seems better now...

SGF:  Not joseki with 'A' being low.  Also, 'B' is not so appealing after 'A' is played sop close.  I would play 'C' -- look at the variations.]
;W[op]
(;B[pp]C[Bommel:  Here I played Taisha, would O4 be better than Q4?

SGF: Definitely.  Look at the variation.];W[po];B[pq];W[oo]
;B[qo];W[qn];B[ro];W[qm];B[rp];W[om];B[mp]LB[jq:C][mq:B][nq:A]
C[No reason to leave a weakenss at 'A'.  'B' is better.  W make be able to use this weakness to help seal off the center.  Having said that, a move at B would clearly make C overconcentrated and this shows again why taisha is wrong.]
;W[co]LB[rg:A][qp:B]C[At this point the lower left and upper right are about equal.in territory.  Given the B can push at 'A' the top left and bottom right can be considered to be a little bigger than the W right side.  So the issue is how much B can nullify the W thickness.  A reduction does not seem to be the right move here because W has too much to soldiify.  So an invasion is needed.  When W played at 'B' B had an excellent chance to take the lead but the choice of joseki there gave him a difficult fight.]
;B[rg]C[This is not as big as it looks because the lower right is also open and  cannot be sealed in senete.]
;W[qi]
(;B[cj]LB[dk:B][cq:A]C[Bommel:  an invasion seems called for here... but where? C10 or D10 feels good, are there better moves I overlooked?

SGF:  Trouble with this move is that it only serves on purpose.  Something more indirect is needed.  Consider playing yosu miru at 'A'  

A lighter erasure at 'B" may also be appropriate.  B has three corners and so does not need to destry all of W's territory.  A move at 'B', providing it is not captured, leaves W hard pressed to get enough territory.]
;W[cl]
(;B[ej]LB[cj:A][cl:B]C[This is a little slow and is open to a cap.   B could consider the A-B exchange as kikashi and make a quick escape, planning to discard 'A" is necessary in order to keep W's territroy to a minimum.]
;W[gj]C[This move is too strong, which shows that the original invasion was too deep.]
;B[dg]LB[el:A]C[Feels wrong to me.  A play at 'A' seems muchg better shape.]

(;B[fj]C[This makes it too easy on W.];W[gi];B[fn]C[Bommel: Would it be better to save the cutting stone F13?

SGF: Absolutely, as shown in a previoius variation.];W[eg];B[hn]
C[B has actually succeeded in reducing W by much more than the original invasion deserved.  Had W played better he would have made B live wihile sealing of the outside.]
;W[ip];B[gp]LB[im:B][iq:A]C[The B group above is not in a lot of danger so playing this way seems counterintuitive.  But better to save a B play at 'A' for later.  I would move out with 'B' and keep this move in reserve.]
;W[gq];B[hp];W[iq]LB[nq:A]C[Forcing this move severly weakens B's lower position.  The aji of 'A' now looks ominous.]
;B[hq];W[hr];B[io];W[ir];B[fk]C[This is not so big.  True that it safes the two B stones to the left but that is not such a big deal at this stage. A reduction to the right is more approriate.]

1.  B needs to learn when to play the taisha.  It was played twice in this game in situations which were not appropriate.
2.  B's invasion of the left side was misplaced, although he did better than he deserved.  An accurate count of the game would have shown that such a deeo invasion was not needed.
3. B missed an opportunity to play ysou miru at the lower left 3-3 point and so lost the chance to reduce that corner later.]
