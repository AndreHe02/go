ouigkmy [6k\]: hello
ouigkmy [6k\]: enjoy the game :\]
altea [6k\]: you too];B[qp]C[Dear reviewer,
thank you for looking at my game ! This is a game I played in a KGS 
tournament against another 6k. I lost on time, but I was just reaching 
for the resign button when my byo yomi ran out :\]

I have written comments at several points in the game, could you tell 
me if they are correct?

ouigkmy - Michal];W[pd]C[-- Hello Michal,

my name is Zoran Rilak (wayward on KGS) and I'll be doing the review 
for White as requested.  

##
# game overview
##];B[dq];W[dd];B[jp]
(;W[co]LB[dn:B][do:A]C[-- I would go for a high approach here (A).  
Black already has a high position on the right, so playing low here is 
only inviting him to build a strong wall facing K10, a development that
 must be avoided.  Alternatively you can play a wider approach, say at 
B, since that tends to result in lighter shapes and give you more 
opportunities to retain sente.  Though, this depends on your knowledge 
of joseki (or simply willingness to make trouble early on).]
;B[do]TR[jp][qp][dq]C[What are white's choices after this? I usually play the 
infamous attach&extend joseki like here, but I'm not really fond of 
it...

-- Not many choices for White after Black got to play D5.  This is a huge move; Black's formation is perfect.  The importance of choosing high over low approach against D3 in this kind of position cannot be understated.  Now Black is very strong and ready to fight here, while White C5 looks as if it parachuted there by mistake.

now White needs to settle as soon as possible, and preferably without touching Black too much, so as to avoid helping him to build up.  Your continuation seems okay.]
;W[dn];B[eo];W[cp];B[cq];W[cm];B[gq]LB[pj:B][fm:A]C[I often feel unsure after this 
joseki - black seems to get a lot out of it, and is quite strong. What 
are alternatives for playing it? If black would omit g3 would an 
invasion at that area work?

Here it does seem however that black was a bit overconcentrated on the 
bottom - and I had sente.

-- This is not as bad for White as it may seem, because Black is one line lower than where he'd be if his first stone was at the fourth line (which is a joseki).  Now the most important point locally is A; White wants to take it as soon as possible (as does Black), but before that an even bigger point at B must be taken where two prospective moyos meet on a largest scale.  I chose to place B on the fourth line instead of third because it makes it harder for Black to extend from R4 and keep his moyo growing.]
;W[pn]C[-- Also an interesting idea.  I don't know any josekis from here, so I can't judge it from that standpoint, but it does have merit in view of limiting Black's moyo. It's too far away to have any direct impact on Q6 though, so I'd expect Black to seek a continuation which enables him to come in between and attack strongly.]
;B[op];W[pj]C[I was happy after this - black stones are only on 
one side of the board.. was this correct judgement?

-- Yeah, this is very good for you.  Q6 should be treated lightly from now on; it has served its purpose in forcing Black P4, and the three white stones on the right work great together.]
;B[cf]LB[ce:A]TR[cm]C[-- Bad idea.  Black lets White attack him strongly.  C7 is low and stable, so Black doesn't want to extend in that direction; but if White plays A and forces him to do so, then his move will be exposed as bad.  See variation.]

(;W[dh]LB[fm:A]C[I played pincer because it seemed to work with the c7 
stones. Would a low one be better here? I chose high because i already 
had a lot of stones on the C line.

-- There's reason behind that, but I'd feel much better about this if you already had a stone at A.  This way I would fear Black could get a chance to come in between the two marked stones at a later point, after he's run away with C14.]
;B[bd]LB[df:A]C[Isn't black supposed to jump out here first?

-- He is :)];W[df]C[I thought this punished black for not jumping out - seals him in, and
 my stones are working together.

-- Excellent thinking.  Very active play.];B[cg]C[-- I dare say this is not standard response...  I believe a wedge at D15 is usual, to create cutting points.]
;W[dg];B[bi]C[-- Black really wants to let you seal him in.]

(;W[cc]LB[cj:A]TR[cm]C[ I think now that this was my first mistake. 
It is terribly gote and does not much for me.

I think should play K16 and get ready to use the influence somehow.

-- First you need to take A, to shut Black off completely, effectively creating a huge wall (A would connect to the marked stone).  If Black feels like invading the top after that, by all means let him do that, and attack with all your might.  See variation.]
;B[hc]LB[ce:A]C[So now I had to think how to use my wall.. which, if I do it 
wrongly, will become a weak group...

-- You can play kikashi at A.];W[he];B[kc];W[mc];B[fc];W[nn]
CR[fe][cj]LB[fm:A]C[I thought this was a good point - 
limits black, and builds my right side. But perhaps its wrong 
direction? Would F7 have been better, because it (very vaguely) works 
with d12 ?

-- I feel uneasy with leaving the upper part of the board.  I can't find a good sente move there though, other than C15, so maybe you're right.  F7 is still very big -- even if it doesn't build you a moyo in itself (C10 and F15 are needed too), it strenghtens your lower left corner group, which will be in serious trouble if Black got to play C9.  I would have a hard time deciding between C10 and F7 myself, but I think I'd opt for C10 in the end -- if for nothing else then to make sure my groups are connected.]
;B[fm]C[--]
(;W[mq]TR[nn]C[Was it too early for an invasion like this? black 
eventually got a huge corner, while I just had a small reduction which 
threatened nothing... so I suppose N3 was bad...

-- N3 would have better been one line higher; you can't really expect to destroy that much of Black's territory down there, and you do want to keep your marked stone as a moyo boundary (i.e. not let Black get ahead of it by cutting), so N4 would be perfect.  See variation.]
;B[rn];W[rm];B[qn];W[qm];B[po];W[on]C[I was happy to get another wall..
 right side looks nice for me now... Black did get a huge corner 
however...

-- It's OK; that corner was Black's.  Good thing he didn't hane at R7 as that could lead into troublesome continuations where both sides fight with groups that are cut off.  Q10 is a little too close to this white wall, but overall this looks OK.]
;B[nq];W[mp];B[qf]C[I was happy with the result, even though black had 
a lot of solid points...  black invades and gives me good occasion for 
using my q6 influence. and he will get another group he has to make 
eyes for...

-- True :)];W[qd]C[attacking from the weaker side];B[qi]LB[rg:A]
C[r10 seemed very passive 
and cramped to me.., but i wanted to pressure those stones somehow..

-- Q10 is sitting right on the shoulder of the marked stone.  This group should die or at least suffer great pains.  See variation.]

(;W[ph]C[So I played this..];B[qh];W[pg];B[pf];W[qg]CR[of]C[cut when you can 
cut... but I should have done p14 probably?

-- Actually this push would work for you if you didn't return to connect later in the sequence.]
;B[rg]LB[re:A]C[-- Now first play A and plan later.]
(;W[pi]C[I connected for stability.. but was this too passive & too cowardish?

so again i'm giving away some points for influence... perhaps i had 
done this too often in the game up till now, if my center doesnt become
 big, it will be a problem... blacks f3 area is big - because of the 
attach&extend joseki.. and r3 is an enormous corner

Black ate away my potential territory on the right side... so the q6 
wall lost its meaning :(

Only hope now is to get a big center..

-- Try to plan ahead so you *don't* rely on your center saving the day.  It's okay to attempt to make some points in the center if you estimate the score during the game and it shows that you're behind some 15 points at most; that much can be made with enough effort, in general.  Anything over and above would work only if your opponent is shut in really, really tightly and your walls are super-solid.

Let's try and estimate the score:
  - Black lower right (LR) corner is about the same as White UR corner
  - Black top is about the same as White LL group plus perhaps a point or two due to UL group (so far)
  - Black has 20 points in LL plus 10-15 points on sides, combined
---
= Black is ahead at least 30 points.

This is a very conservative estimate which does no justice to Black.  He has two very strong groups at the bottom; his only weakness is the group on the right.  White, on the other hand, is mostly unsettled (save for the upper right corner) and this gives Black the upper hand in endgame moves which he can start playing just about now.  If Black adopts the strategy of attacking White while simply strenghtening his own groups and defining boundaries, White will have very little time to recover.]
;B[re]C[-- Just the kind of move to make as Black in this position.]
;W[of]C[-- This goes along well with your idea of enlarging the center, but it is far too open for this move to be of any material value (imagine Black K9 and K15).]
;B[rd]
(;W[jn]C[This seemed to me to build a nice moyo and 
reduce black.. but my center is still open from the top..

-- Yes, that's why you should start on the top.  Black has a weakish group there, and your own Q16 group would benefit from an extra stone or two in the vicinity.  See variation for a possible continuation.]

;B[ke]LB[kg:A][go:B]C[Ok, so black lost some points there, 
but l15 hurt a lot... losing sente was probably not so good an idea... 
so my main concern should be to defend center now... but will it be big
 enough? seems hard for w :/

-- White can try with a capping play at L13.  Of course, Black has a field day in reducing white moyo...

Another option is to try and reduce Black with G5.  Actually, strike that: simply reducing Black will not suffice here.  White must look for a way to start a confusing fight somewhere in order to possibly even the odds :)  G5 looks OK in that it threatens both a push at E6 and an attachment at H3.  However, Black can get a chance to hane at J6 and ruin what little center White would have made there...]
;W[lf]C[I was worried about the o15 cut.. But with the dead black 
stones it of course does not work :/ A very bad misread.

C[akacja [2k\]: oo 
sie riecht blut];B[dj]C[So here the torubles began... black cut me at the left side, 
and I had to struggle with those gorups...]
(;W[cj]LB[ej:A]C[e10 better?

-- I'd probably go E10.];B[ci];W[di]C[-- E10 still seems to give you better chances to connect...]
;B[ej];W[ck];B[ek]C[Bad result for me..
 I should have somehow gone out with that group,,, now i'm 
surrounded... and also d13 wall will get in trouble...

-- Aye, a veritable disaster :)];W[el];B[fl];W[fk]C[Lebertran [1d?\]: ah jetzt wirds spannend



Panic move... black still has D8... :(

-- It happens, believe me.  It happens. O:-)];B[dl];W[cl];B[em]
;W[bj]C[akacja [2k\]: jep];B[aj];W[bl]C[
I suspect these moves are bad... I wanted to make eyes somehow for that
 group... but perhaps this wasnt the major issue at this point.. ? But 
if black kills that group the game is over..

-- Then it is the major point :)];B[ch]C[akacja [2k\]: mord und todschlag:)]
;W[ak];B[bc]LB[db:A]C[-- Here you can play D18 to defend and attack the top stones at the same time.  Also, C15 is still sente.]
;W[jr]C[So this was perhaps the game-losing move... I rush to reduce black 
while D13 wall has become weak.. was a move around g12 better? gives 
wall a place to run.. and builds moyo a little bit...

-- You can't afford to simply run with your stones at this point.  Each move you make must "pack a punch" to Black.  You're well on your way to lose the game (a quick estimate gives B+25 not including white center, which theoretically could give you 30ish points if Black let you wall it up, but Black has bigger and better endgame threats).  Still, after that big capture in the upper right corner, you might just pull it off: firstly you attack the top Black group from the direction of your endangered wall, then you turn around J6, then wall yourself in and hope for the best.  Oh, and R10 is sente too.]
;B[iq]
(;W[eb]LB[gb:A]C[And even now I should not play this but get my stones 
safe.... I rushed to attack H17 stones, while I'm weak myself... the 
result of stress!

That is the proper way, in fact: attack while strenghtening yourself.  This move seems timid though; it's far too easy for Black to defend by descending to F18.  Maybe something like A?  (see variation)]
;B[fb];W[id]C[Even now..];B[ee];W[de];B[ff]C[and black correctly 
ignored the strange move j16 and proceeded to create a lot of trouble 
for me...];W[fh]C[So I try to run.. but black will chase me.. and ruin the moyo 
in the process... seems hard for w now :/

Overplayish move perhaps.. but I had to try something...];B[jd]
;W[if];B[hh]C[Black didnt take the ko.. but indeed i should 
immediately respond to h12 by plaing h11];W[jg]C[But I was too eager to have two ponnukis  there.. but indeed, 
this allowed black to surround me. So perhaps this lost the game..]

Moyo completely gone.. group under pressure...];W[bb]C[
hasty attempt at life, or one eye.. I should probably f10 first?

-- Yes, F10 comes to mind here as well];B[cd];W[db];B[ec];W[dc]
;B[ab];W[ca];B[ea]C[-- But this little sequence was good for you.  One half-eye in sente (Black B19 for a ko), nothing wrong with that :)]

wanted to use my ponnukis somehow];B[jb];W[ic];B[ib];W[hr]C[Also bad i think.. black can even ignore this

-- :D];B[gr];W[hq];B[hp];W[ir]C[Now I see that creating this reduction gives

the brink of resigning. I hope my comments helped and I thank you again
 in advance for your commentary.

ouigkmy - Michal

-- Michal, it was an interesting game to review.  Overall you show good reading potential, but I would dare say you fell prey to your own emotions more than anything else :)  Please consider a few strategical advices I gave you during the review, particularly ones involving how to attack to gain strength when you are weak and how to sacrifice to gain thickness, and I believe you will move from your current rank pretty quickly.  Also, you might benefit from playing a couple of games where you deliberately focus on gaining territory and stable groups; even if that is not your "natural" style of play, you will learn to counter your opponents' center-oriented play and therefore strenghten your own.

I beg you to forgive me for any serious errors I may have made during the review.  Should you have additional questions, please feel free to contact me at zoran.rilak@gmail.com or just drop me a note as wayward on KGS.

All the best in your future endeavors,
Zoran])

Now Black is in a predicament: he wants to extend the usual three points, but that would be a bit too far in this position (because of C7); extending two lines would be safer, but it seems a little too passive.  Another thing to worry about is how high to play: third line is better for eyes, but White is strong on both sides and might easily attack from above; fourth line is faster, but White has stones on the top and right, so escaping will let White make territory there.]
