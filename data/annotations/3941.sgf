AB[dd][pp]C[Hi there!

This is a game I recently played on the Dragon Go Server. As a game can take q
uite some time there both my opponent and me (at least attempted to) put more 
thought into the moves than we usually do in internet games, and that's why I 
decided to send this game for review.

I enjoyed playing this game a lot, though I consider it all but a masterpiece 
- I reckon that there must have been lots of careless mistakes in my local play; but in particular I'd like to hear your advice concerning  some strategical decisions of mine which I now, reviewing the game, kind of regret. Feel free to comment on everything you notice - all of your remarks will be carefully studied. :)

I took the black stones here, but as I will send the review to my opponent as well, comments on both White's and Black's moves would be greatly appreciated.

I've gone through the game myself briefly and will mark my comments with "fey".

Hope you have fun reviewing our game, too!

Best wishes,

Hi!]PL[W];W[pe];B[cn]C[fey: Playing 6-3 from time to time has become kind of a habit... I tends to
 work our quite well most of the time, though I haven't exactly figured out if
 that's due to it's confusing effect on the opponent. ;)

-------
well, I don't think it's a good move : where to play next in this area ? If D4, or D3, corner is not yet secure (you need 3 moves to secure the corner) ; so 5-3 for a shimari or to enclose white (if he take the 4-3 point) is slightly better (but it's not a big mistake).]
;W[fc];B[df];W[jd];B[pc]C[fey: I wonder if this kakari (looks more like an invasion actually) was imp
atient and if a play on the bottom would have been better as white's top posit
ion is still open for invasion.
The 5-4 joseki that follows always scared me - I had the feeling that I always
 got the worse of the exchange when playing it.

-----
Probably white was expecting black here to make some influence ; so it's too early to come here...]
;W[nd];B[qe]
(;W[qd]C[the aim of white, if he choose this joseki, is probably to complicate the game (not to make influence)
-----
see alternative for white from move 8];B[pd];W[qc]LB[qf:A]
(;B[qf]C[fey: R18 should be the proper way to play here - I knew the joseki this f
ar, but as mentioned above, I seldom liked the result after playing R18 and tried R14 here which my joseki program marks as a mistake.
-----
The result after the usual joseki is not bad for black (see variation)]
;W[od];B[pb];W[qb];B[nb];W[nc];B[ob];W[pf];B[pg]SQ[qg]C[fey: Possibly better at the marked point? I considered both points, chosi
ng Q13 in the end because it took white a liberty but in hindsight this doesn't sound like a good reason to leave the R13 cut behind.
------
Yes, R13 is better];W[lb];B[rd];W[rc]C[useless (I think it's better for white to play in another corner now)]
;B[re];W[qa];B[sb];W[sc];B[sd];W[mb];B[ra];W[qg];B[rg];W[qh]
;B[og];W[nf];B[rh];W[qi];B[oi];W[pk]C[fey: I terribly envied him for having played this move and took quite som
e time deciding where to play next. In fact, I was a little clueless here, con
sidered M12, for example, but lacked a definite plan...
------
Sealing white and forcing it to live small when making influence is usualy good, but it's too early her. By the way, pushing white on the 4th line is usualy bad. I think it's better to play big points, or to play M12 if you don't want to lose your central stones.]
;B[ok]C[fey: ... so I highly doubt that this was a good choice.
-------
too early];W[pl];B[ol];W[pj];B[oj];W[qn];B[np]
(;W[ri]C[fey: This seemed a little slow in a handicap game, especially with the bo
ttom right corner still open.
Wasn't there some better defense for White here, the S4 slide as a possible idea, or even tenuki?
----
Too slow for white here (may be P6)];B[jp]C[fey: This one doesn't feel to good now either, perhaps a shimari in the l
ower left would have been better?
---
yes indeed];W[ch]C[fey: I'm quite uncertain about the following sequence which basically onl
y gave me a weak group. Instead of the C9 I played, E13 didn't look very appealing here and I moved C9 to expand my bottom moyo, being confident to somehow mange my to stones above... actually sounds quite greedy. ;)]

(;B[ck];W[ce];B[de];W[bd]
(;B[cc]C[corner is not important, as open on 2 sides (see variation)]
;W[cf];B[ge];W[hd];B[eh];W[di]
(;B[dq]C[fey: Urgent points before big points, I guess.
Tenuki would hand the initiative in the fight on the top to white and seemed risky here, but in the game, I didn't see a good defensive move and decided to let my stones look after themselves.
This isn't sound strategy, I'm afraid, and looking at the board now, E11 seems sufficient and also glances at a central moyo.
----
White is not yet alive and black is not so weak here, so E10 could be considered (see variations)]
;W[ei];B[hg];W[on]C[fey: Another hard choice: N6 for a magnificient-looking moyo at the botto
m or defense for my weak stones in the center?
I decided on the latter, already feeling quite guilty about D3... ;)]

(;B[mm]C[mmh, terrible move here (see variation)];W[mn];B[lp]
C[fey: This looks like a serious mistake in strategy and, again, quite gree
dy and careless.
In my opinion a defensive move now would have spared me lots of trouble. Thoug
h one can, in my view, be confident that both of the black groups will manage 
to live somehow, I feel an urge to strenghten them in retrospect.
------
painfull for black here];W[lm];B[lh];W[jh];B[jg];W[kg];B[kh]

;W[gi];B[ec];W[fb];B[eb];W[eq];B[dp];W[dr];B[cr];W[hq];B[iq]
;W[hp];B[rp];W[ro];B[in]C[fey: This prepared for the cut at O6 and a splitting attack on M7 and H3 
groups.
I hesitated a long time before deciding on this move - surely there was lots of aji in my bottom position and my first idea was to defend somewhere in answer to S5, but I wasn't able to choose a move that removes the aji and isn't just plainly defensive, so I made this somehow vague move of J6.]
;W[kq];B[kp];W[mq]C[this move seems very unresonable. White can't expect to live or connect in sente under black stones ; so too many problems for him...]
;B[mp];W[nq];B[oq];W[or];B[pr]LB[ir:B][nr:A]C[fey: I gave way here so tamely because I had read out that, if he connect
ed with J2, I could capture most of the invading stones.
In the variation I noticed that this seems only possible in ko, so I misread during the game. :/]

(;W[nr];B[ir];W[qq]C[fey: A nice move on White's part, I absolutely didn't see this coming.

Yes but it's only a gote yose move...
(see following moves)];B[pq]C[fey: This is where White resigned. According to his analysis, White sti
ll can't match Black in territory (he counted Black to be about 20 points ahead on the board), and in potential for growth - with the cut at O6 White has two weak groups which Black can harass.
I wonder if he's really that far behind at this point that he can't make up the difference with a good endgame, but my counting isn't all that accurate anyways.

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review our game, every piece of advice is welcome!
