R: Hi, my name is Riaan!  I'm a 3k from South Africa!  Hope you find my review helpful!]
;B[pd]C[Overall not sure why I lost this one. I saw one early mistake, but overall, I was in control, so clearly I made some strategic blunders.]

[qf][dj][pj][qn][nq]C[R: Oh no! How many points would estimate have you made here in gote?  Check alternate branch for answer!  This was a very big mistake!  Any of the square moves are about 3 or 4 times as big!]
;B[dm];W[dl];B[nq]
(;W[lp]TR[qn]C[I didn't want to give him a big territory down here, so the pincer.

R: This invites black to split, creating two weak groups for you with one "weakish" group for black.  I think it is too early for this!  Your corner will certainly suffer.  If you defend normally, you can always reduce later as his territory is by no means secure!  You should be wary of creating too many weak groups!  If you have more than your opponent, you will lose!]
;B[no];W[oq];B[mp]C[R: Here the two weak groups are starting to take their toll.]
;W[ko];B[lq];W[kq];B[lo];W[kp];B[kn];W[lr]C[I wanted to give a shot at connecting underneath, but clearly this was a mistake which left my corner vulnerable, but I got to protect my corner, later so it wasn't a big deal]
;B[mr];W[mq];B[nr];W[ln];B[mo];W[jn];B[km];W[jm];B[kl];W[jl]
;B[io];W[jo];B[iq];W[kk]C[Here I escaped];B[ll];W[lk]C[I'm not sure if this was a mistake, it gave me a nice pair of stones to sacrifice when he doubled down on the cut, but did strengthen him on the right side, where he ended up getting most of his territory

R: This looks great to me, locally!];B[ml];W[fl]C[and now I'm feeling pretty good, wedge group has pretty much escaped and connected up, and blocked him in]
;B[pn];W[qo];B[qn];W[or]C[R: He was really kind here!  You are extremely lucky.]
;B[jk];W[hl]TR[pf]C[R: It is a good idea to strengthen this group, but unfortunate that you need to... if you were abloe to make this move around the marked area you would make a huge amount of points in sente!]
;B[pj]C[R: Now the invasion becomes very difficult...];W[lh]
TR[kk][lk]SQ[cd][pd][pj][jk]C[should I have played a shorter extension here?

R: I don't think this is the correct direction at all!  Approaching the two corners is of much higher value and urgency here!  This doesn't really do much... the two weak stones are not worth anything.  I think this might be the losing move!  Black can attack this group conveniently from the right side and make many points!  You need to get into his sides immediately!  This group ends up being a burden for your entire game.  Given that black outnumbers you on the right side already, he is much better able to attack and capitilise by attacking your weak group.  His presence on the left side will also make your attack on the black group much less lucrative.]
;B[jj];W[jh];B[hj]TR[fl][hl][jl][jm][jn]C[R: The weakness of the bottom group is making your life difficult again!  If only you were able to attack this group without consequence!]
;W[fj];B[gk]C[I didn't mind this pattern overall the chance to build territory on the side, while attacking]
;W[gl];B[fk];W[ek];B[ii];W[ih];B[hh];W[fh];B[hg];W[ff]TR[ih]
[jh][lh][kk][lk]C[R: Are you now abandoning your critically weak group?  This weakens the group even further and has hardly any effect on attacking, territory or points!]
;B[df];W[dg];B[cg];W[ch];B[eg];W[dh];B[ef];W[fg];B[eh];W[ei]
;B[he];W[fd]TR[ec][qc][ih][jh][lh][kk][lk]C[R: Black's corner is being overlooked completely!  The other corner has also become very difficult to invade as black's influence is vast and you still have a weak group to take care of!]
;B[ec]C[R: Black will be extremely satisfied by this!];W[je]
C[R: Black's dragon is difficult to attack!];B[hc];W[jc];B[ki]
C[I felt like I had to connect here. I wasn't unsatisfied with what I'd accomplished, and figured if I had to sacrifice two stones, it was better than risking my upper group

R: This is correct, the weak stones are pretty meaningless!]
;W[kh];B[li];W[mi];B[mj];W[nd]C[Should I have played p15 instead? His right side territory ended up massive.

R: I think you have already put yourself at a great disadvantage by creating this weak floating group in black's territory!  Where to approach is not really the most important question.  You should be more concerned about attacking the corners in the early game!]
;B[of];W[nf];B[ni];W[mh];B[fc];W[gd];B[hd];W[gc];B[gb];W[nh]
;B[oh];W[oi];B[nj]C[Any tesuji I missed in this sequence?  A bigger reduction would have won me the game]
;W[og];B[ph];W[pg];B[qg]TR[qh]C[R: Perhaps this?]
(;W[pf];B[qf]TR[qc]C[R: This is just too nice for black, why not just invade the corner?]
;W[pe];B[qe];W[od];B[pc];W[oc];B[pb];W[ob]C[R: Black gained many many points for free in the past few moves!]
;B[ib];W[jb];B[bg];W[bh];B[jr];W[dp];B[eq];W[eo];B[em]
(;W[el]TR[fm]C[R: Why not the marked move?];B[fn];W[do];B[fo]
;W[fm];B[en];W[hn];B[go];W[ro];B[rn];W[sn];B[sm];W[so];B[rl]
;W[op];B[np];W[oo];B[on];W[pa];B[qb];W[gi];B[hi]C[R: The rest of the game is pretty uneventful.  

Overall, I would say that you need to consider the point value of each move more carefully!  You priorities should look something like this:

1. Do I have any weak groups?  If so, fix them!
2. Does my opponent have any weak groups? If so, attack them!
3. Make points!

Go through this list with each move as much as possible.  I think you have a good sense of where your opponent will make points, but you don't know how to balance preventing this with making points yourself.  It is very important to have as few weak groups as possible, as they can easily become a burden for the entire game and prevent you from doing what you want to do!]

(;W[ed]C[R: You play elsewhere... a pretty threatening and high-value move!]
;B[cr]C[R: But your opponent is stubborn, it is time for him to cash in on the threat that you so recklessly ignored...]
;W[br];B[ds]TR[aq][bq][ar][dr][fr][es][fs]C[R: 2 points in black's favor, considering the captive.  The main branch has about 6 points in white's favor, meaning about an 8 point difference.  I would even argue that this is gote as well, so white gets two "free" moves aswell!  In summary, in this branch you sacrifice 8 points to get two free moves!  A massive win for white!]
