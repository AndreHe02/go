RE[W+37.5]

C[This game was an even game played offline. I am around 15k, I don't know the strength of the opponent. In this game I have 2 major questions:
1) In the opening stages of the game white seemed to gain a huge influence in the center of the board. How could I have played the opening better so as to mitigate this?
2) In the middlegame, I couldn't find any good plays, while white seemed to have lots of them.

Also, anything else that you can think of would be appreciated.

%%% The influence White got wasn't such a big deal because at that point he couldn't use it for anything. The reason he got it was because you invaded and any invasion usually gives outside influence to the invadee, but I don't think that's why he won. It was rather because he (or she) got to play bigger moves. It would seem he is a couple of stones stronger than you?

(;B[lc]TR[nc]C[I wanted to keep white from taking the entire top.

%%% "White taking the entire top" is a delusion. And the joseki choice here is questionable since it will probably give away sente for White to fix his original mistake.]

(;W[ne]LB[qc:a]C[
%%% White plays "out of the books". When this happens I usually look at where the opponent "should have" played and try to figure out why and what he gave up by not doing so. That's the first step to figuring out how to punish it, if indeed it is punishable. Blindly going by joseki, White should've played A here -- to take the corner and to make a base for his stones (the latter being the most important). So here I would probably do what White neglected to do: take the corner and remove his chance for eyes along the edge.]

%%% Very bad move. You are defending about 6 points here. (If you take a look at the two variations of endgame moves you'll see why I can say there is only about 6 points here; since each side is equally likely to get them you take the average: (10+3)/2 = 6.5 points)) It also shows some lack of focus when it comes to what you want to do on this side. You played 7 on the fourth line so it would seem you only wanted a presence here, as well as influence, but now you are going for a very small solid territorial group...]

%%% Think of a game of go as a series of Black-White exchanges. Here you exchange A for B. With A you took about 6 points and with B, White took about 15 points. I think it's safe to say that this was a very bad exchange by Black. Another really bad exchange that happened is C for D. Studying exchanges like this will help you focus on bigger points.]

[dj][qf][rd][pd][cj][cg][mq]C[%%% This is a good time to look back at the game and identify your mistakes. First there is 15, giving up the corner and giving White a base for practically nothing (6 points). Then came 19 and 21, which made a small group here (only 6 points again, just as I predicted ;) ), while White got time to make a huge corner. Allowing White 72 (marked stone at the bottom) split you into to tiny groups again, of 6 and 7 points.

%%% In conclusion I think your main weakness is you are perhaps too territorial. (And you play really small territorial moves instead of big ones, but that has more to do with your level, I guess.) In this game you ended up with lots of tiny groups in the end which hardly added up to any territory at all. Try studying moyo games or playing moyo games yourself. In moyo you -can't- take the time to play slow moves on the second or first line just to protect or make a handful of territory points; you need to play BIG. Also, you follow your opponent around a lot, responding to his moves even when they are too are small.
