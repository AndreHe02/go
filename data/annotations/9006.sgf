(;W[gq]C[Bad shape, this move does not do anything good. Try to imagine what black can do in the next move, then surely you will see you can do better. Check variation.]
;B[rq]C[Now he gets to live in the corner because you did not play there earlier. This is why R4 was important as I showed earlier.]

;B[io];W[kn]C[msambol: Not sure what that's about, but it's another weak stone when I don't need any more. Should have done E5, M4, O7...

-> This is actualy a good move, it splits the two black groups. You need howhever to find a way to connect all of your stones in order to not get killed.]

;B[qc];W[qb];B[qe]C[Bad move by black.]
(;W[qf]C[msambol: not smart, I think. should have focused on strengthening the ones at top, getting into the corner - worst case lose these two stones isn't that big a deal.

-> Indeed AND black has no way to actualy kill the stones. if you read you will see that it was a bad move by black with a bad reply by white. White can kill black even. Look at the variation.]
;B[rb];W[qa];B[ra]
(;W[pb];B[oa]C[msambol: and now they're dead, and I don't see any good options either. And those two stones I "saved" are still in trouble and going to be a drag. Need now to strengthen the two at O13-14.

O13-O14 don't need strengthening.

You can save your group at the top even now though.  Look at the variations to the next move to see how to live.]
(;W[la]C[msambol: wasted 

Wrong, see variation.];B[na]C[msambol: And the entire top left corner is all his, how do I get in? Uh oh...

Top left corner is too strong now, no way for you to get in.]
;W[hh]C[Good move but too late.];B[ka];W[ig];B[kf];W[he]C[ H15 and J13 not connected, bad shape.]
;B[if];W[hf];B[hg]C[And black exploited your weakness. 

REMEMBER this very well: Knights move can be cut. Try to put knights move on a board an try to find 2 different ways to cut it. If you learn only this you will be 2 stones stronger.]

Indeed, you need to read ahead what your oponent will do before you place a stone down.]

[oq][ol][pl][pk][pi][qk][qj][qi][qh][rk][ri][sj]C[Overall you played well but here are a few tips to play better:

-Read as much as you can what the oponent is going to do. Try to imagine all of the moves before actualy making your move.

-Try to attack groups on the board, stones cannot just come into your area and live. They must die or you make profit somewhere else.

- Do tsumego's for example on http://gochild2009.appspot.com/

Also do life & death in order to not get killed like above.

And last but not least enjoy yourself ... and soon you will be a lot stronger :-)

Hope you liked the review, please ask questions if you have some.

Cheers,
