;B[pd]C[Hi, Marcus, I am Bernd, HonFu in the GTL and on KGS.

Since fuseki interests you most, I have investigated more thoroughly there than in the middle game. I hope you will get some good hints!]
;W[cd]C[first problem^^
i like 3-4 points but i'm not sure how to start
c4 or d3 could lead to opposing 3-4 points and i don't think that's good for white

Hon: Opposing 3-4 points for white are a very common pattern, and not at all disadvantageous.

This move here on the other hand is a move entitled "Game losing move" by Takeo Kajiwara, a 9p professional who wrote the famous book "Direction of Play". His attitude is sometimes a bit extreme, but one can easily understand his reasoning (see variation).]
(;B[pq];W[dq]C[not happy here, too
K3 vital point for both sides

Hon: K3 is not small, but not too big yet either. Only after there are shimaris, the side becomes big. The area of worry should rather be E16.]
;B[pk]
(;W[jq];B[ec];W[de]
(;B[hd]C[Hon: This is not joseki.]
(;W[dc]C[Hon: I think you want to overconcentrate him here, but maybe this comes a bit too quickly. When black stands on H17, he is very solid anyway, so you can as well crush him a little more. But with the stone on H16 by attaching you rather destroy the aji of F15 and K17, which might be the better moves. 

This is a moyo game, so the focus is more on the sides and center, and less on the corner territory.]
;B[ed]
(;W[nc];B[lc];W[ne]C[i wanted to make pressure on both side, since 3-3 invasion or double kakari seemed to good for black, maybe o17 wasn't good from the beginning?

Hon: Considering the state of the game, something like O17 seems natural. I am just not sure if you should not just have double pincered or taken the corner, since you will have no real chance of doing anything on the outside.]
;B[pf]C[Hon: You have jumped out, but what next? You said you wanted to pressure groups, but it seems like the upper side won't have trouble, but rather you will. Maybe taking the corner one way or another was a wiser policy.]
(;W[ng]
(;B[le]
(;W[pb]C[Hon: This move often is not good, after M17 is there. 

The first reason that comes to mind is that you play away the possibility of entering the corner, but you will not have eyes here anyway. So in many situations it is a loss for nothing. But in this case I am not so sure myself ...]
(;B[qc]C[Hon: But actually if he answers here, one might as well see Q18 as a forcing exchange. If white plays Q12 first, black takes Q18 and lives in the corner anyways, so like this white has got a free endgame move.]
(;W[po]
(;B[np];W[qq]
(;B[pp]C[Hon: Bad move. Black is giving simple life to white with no reason.]
;W[qp];B[oo];W[pn];B[lq]C[q2 seemed big, should i have played it now?

Hon: No. Q2 is an endgame-like move, since both groups are already alive.]
(;W[jo]
(;B[oh];W[og]C[Hon: Aimless playing. White ends up just strengthening black.]
;B[pg];W[ph];B[pi];W[qh];B[qi];W[lf];B[kf];W[lg];B[co]
(;W[ep]C[keima better with k3/k5?

Hon: Yes, but since you have a position in the upper left, I would rather recommend a pincer.]
;B[dl];W[cj]C[Hon: Good. Black should have extended on the 3rd line, since white has a position in the upper left. Like this black just set up a good double-purpose move for white.]
;B[ck];W[dj];B[gp]C[Hon: Hm, okay. Black tries to exploit the wideness of whites position. I had the same width in a game once, and surprisingly everything fell apart. Still - this is white's moyo, he should not become too defensive here!]
(;W[cp];B[do];W[fo]C[taking care of k3/k5 more importand?

Hon: By not letting connect G4 to the buddies, you weaken him, and thereby relatively strengthen your K3 group. Anyway, it will be a battle.]
;B[ho];W[fm];B[hm];W[ln];B[ff];W[dg];B[jm];W[lp];B[mp];W[lo]
;B[qm];W[rn];B[rm];W[pr];B[or];W[qr];B[nq]
(;W[on]C[Hon: If you could connect like that, alright, but if not, you will only hurt the lower side group. And the lower right does not need additional care.]
(;B[nn];W[ol]
(;B[oj]C[Hon: I wonder what this passive move is about.];W[kq]
;B[lr];W[nm];B[mn];W[lm];B[mm];W[ml]
(;B[gr];W[hq];B[gq];W[hp]C[Hon: Not good ...];B[go]C[Hon: ... since you weaken the connection on the other side.]
(;W[bo];B[bn];W[bp];B[cm]C[Hon: White was too generous in this area.]
(;W[ke]C[Hon: This is the price for wanting sente with the hane at L14 earlier.

If it is urgent, is another question, especially since you get gote in the end.]
(;B[kd];W[je];B[jd];W[jf]C[Hon: Convenient for white, but gote.]
;B[ik];W[jh];B[kj];W[me]C[to small...or was cutting possible without this one?

Hon: I don't think black could cut you here. If you want to solidify, then M8 seems to be more important.]
;B[ll];W[jn];B[ip];W[in];B[io];W[im];B[jl];W[hn];B[gn];W[gm]

;B[fi];W[fh];B[ei];W[eh];B[hh];W[ii]C[Hon: Nice catch! :-)

But I am sure you felt a certain "uneasiness" when black cut at M8. You might as well have died here!]
;B[eo];W[dp];B[br];W[cr];B[bq]
(;W[aq];B[ds];W[cs];B[ar];W[es];B[er];W[dr];B[fr];W[ao];B[ap]
;W[bs];B[aq]C[i was happy with seki, but propably more would have been possible]
(;W[fp];B[qn];W[qo];B[mb];W[nb];B[qb];W[eb];B[fb];W[db];B[cf]
(;W[df]C[maybe better let him cut and try to kill black at the left side? if i play first cutting at k2 is possible...if i didn't oversee something]
;B[bi]
(;W[cg];B[bj];W[bh];B[hg]C[Hon: At this point, the game looks still close. But now (instead of playing in the area of N9, which is important) black goes on a mission to save these two stones. A few moves later he will have to resign. 

So in hindsight we want to ask: What is so special about the one stone at H12?]
;W[he];B[ge];W[hf];B[gg];W[gf];B[fg];W[fe];B[dh];W[eg];B[di]
;W[ci];B[ee];W[gd];B[ef];W[id];B[ic];W[hc];B[bg];W[ah];B[ag]
;W[ch]C[Hon: Catastrophy for black, and totally unnecessary.

Okay, this was the review. I hope I have been able to give you some ideas about direction in the opening and in the middle game fighting, which you can use in further games. Good luck!]

(;W[bj]C[Hon: You can play here - just a matter of counting liberties.]

;B[mj];W[nj]

)))
(;W[er]C[Hon: Like this white should be able to keep his points.]
))
(;B[je];W[kd];B[ld]C[Hon: Sometimes this is a good sequence, but in this case one has doubt that black can handle it.]
))
(;W[fk]C[Hon: How about a move like this? Black has a weak group that deserves some pummeling. Like this the weakness of E5 can be masked somewhat.]
))
(;W[tt];B[eo]C[Hon: Black can aim at cutting you there now, which wasn't possible before.]
))
(;B[ll]C[Hon: If black can still cut here, what was the purpose of O7?]
))
(;B[nl]C[Hon: Black should look for a way to isolate the lower side white group.]
)
(;B[ll]C[Hon: Or, if black is afraid of his bottom group, he should show white the neutral way out]
;W[mm];B[ml];W[nm];B[me]C[Hon: ... then see if he can attack the top group. By the way ...]
;W[cm]C[Hon: ... black still has large problems. Sooner or later white might come in here. This is the result of G4, which might be just a bit too harsh a move.]
))
(;B[qn];W[qo];B[ro];W[rp];B[sn];W[sr]C[Hon: Alive.]))
(;W[ll]C[Hon: White maybe should jump out now, furthermore isolating the black center group ...]
;B[fl]C[Hon: ... or, after the fight has ended (should black be able to handle this situation), white might safe his weak groups by connecting them.]
;W[lj]C[Hon: But if we look at this, then whites whole group, the dragon from the upper right to the lower side, is not taking any points. Weak groups do not only risk a swift K.O., they also tend to become stripped of all their value.]
))
(;W[en]C[Hon: And black also has to watch out.

But if white defended on the lower side, keima or attaching would have been safer shape.]
))
(;W[cm]C[Hon: This move attacks, helping you to increase the lower side, but it also extends from the upper left. Try to find double-purpose moves like this!]
;B[eo];W[fp]C[Hon: Like this white gets in the keima anyway.]
;B[dl];W[cl];B[dk];W[dm];B[em];W[ck];B[dj];W[cp];B[bo];W[ci]
;B[dn]C[Hon: Like this white gets the points on both sides, and white's weaknesses just get fixed naturally.]
)
(;W[do]C[Hon: Locally this is also an option, after you played K5.]
;B[dn];W[eo];B[cp];W[cq];B[ck];W[ci]C[Hon: Looks very reasonable to me, especially since white still gets in a pincer on the left side, extension for his upper left.]
))
(;B[ph]C[Hon: What a pity that black can fix up his weakness. Also white's top right group is weak now.]
))
(;W[ph]C[Hon: Rather go on the offensive now and split up the right side!]
))
(;B[qr]C[Hon: This move is a must. In black's position white must not have an easy base.]
;W[qp];B[rr];W[qm];B[rl]C[Hon: After black playd O4, he should try and see if he can attack this group a bit and in the meantime settle the upper right, before white comes in there.

I think, Q12 instead of O4 might have been wiser - especially since it is not only defensive but also offensive by weakening white's baseless group in the top right.]
))
(;B[ph]C[Hon: If black plays here now, white gets a weak group, while black is solid on both sides. It looks like a good opportunity to me, but of course Q3 might suffer somewhat.]
))
(;W[ph]C[Hon: If white now plays here, he seems like having it both ways. But I am not totally sure about it - kind of new thinking for me as well. :-)]
))
(;B[ph]C[Hon: Although white plays away the corner, maybe black can or should refuse this present and instead connect with his bottom stones.]
;W[qc]C[Hon: White takes the corner now of course, and then we move on with the fuseki. Also looks playable to me, since now black's and white's stones work together.]
))
(;W[ph]C[Hon: After you went that far, you should go and surround him. Outside was the direction you chose, so with this move you keep in rhythm with your own strategy. You isolate the corner stones and break up the right side.]
;B[pb]C[Hon: If he lives one way or the other ...];W[pn]C[Hon: You will go on with your breakup- work. But you also must watch out for your keima from O13. By settling the corner differently (entering or double pincer), you would have had a live group and some points and would reduce black more later.

Might be also a matter of taste again.]))
(;B[ph]C[Hon: I think, black should play here. E17 and H16 can stand alone if they have to, so maybe black does not have to fear the invasion at K17 so much, especially since white might end up getting very weak with his other stones.]
))
(;W[kd]C[Hon: And if you now just press on like in the normal joseki ..]
;B[kc];W[jd];B[jc]C[Hon: ... you just end up helping him more than yourself, while the meaning of your outside stones is very much in doubt.]
))
(;W[dg]C[Hon: Actually I think, a move here would be proper shape. Of course one feels the urge to enter the upper side, but the development there was only the likely thing to happen after C16.]
))
(;W[fe];B[fd];W[dk]C[Hon: If white wants to, he can build a moyo like this.]
;B[ge];W[ff]C[Hon: This is maybe playable, since white builds up very thickly, and black is still wide at the top.]
)
(;W[jc]C[Hon: Black also has to watch out for weakpoints like this, which will help white to enter the upper side, if he needs to.]
))
(;B[ic]C[Hon: This would be the normal move.]))
(;W[nc]C[Hon: This looks like a good opportunity to prevent black's approach ...]
;B[pf]
(;W[ic]C[Hon: ... by setting up the so-called mini-chinese pattern (since you felt K3 a large point I suppose you're familiar with the basics of chinese fuseki).]
)
(;W[hc]C[Hon: I think, this is also played.];B[jp]C[Hon: Black may play somewhere on the lower side and build up a moyo there, but in the chinese fuseki the upper and lower sides are miai - black will have his moyo one way or the other. So this time, because of the directional weakness of the C16 stone, I would opt for the mini chinese pattern.]
)))
(;B[ed]C[Hon: In the fuseki we can get an advantage if we can do two things at the same time. This move extends from the hoshi (a hoshi loves extensions to the side) AND he prevents a shimari, which is also big.

So actually with his first move, white has only set up a good development opportunity for black. In a way he is playing into black's hands.]
;AW[dc][dq]AB[pp]AE[cd][ed]LB[dc:2][pd:1][pp:3][dq:4]C[Hon: This is not the case if white plays 2. Black may approach the corner from D15 or something, but this does not guarantee him a relationship of that stone with his hoshi stone.

If the fuseki proceeds with 3 and 4, black may approach either of the corners, but this is not a double purpose move then, since there is not necessarily a relation to the hoshi stones.]
;AW[cd]AE[dc][pp][dq]LB[cd:2][pd:1]C[Hon: Now if white plays that move ...]
;W[tt];B[po]C[Hon: ... Black does not immediately approach the corner, but just plays an influencial point in the lower right (Kajiwara says: only move) ...]
;W[dp];B[ed]C[Hon: ... and after white occupies the lower left, the kakari on E16 is just perfect. From here on white has a hard time finding josekis that prevent the increase of black's center influence.

Probably it would be fair to say that I try this opening every time white plays c16 and almost always lose. :-) It might depend also on your ability to handle influence positions. Patient players still might play this with white ...]
;W[df]C[Hon: ... since by choosing this joseki ...];B[cc];W[bc]
;B[dc];W[be];B[ic]C[Hon: ... white gets sente, so he can just go with the fuseki by playing somewhere on the right.

It will be a game where white is busy reducing black's influence and point by point increasing his territory - something for players who are not afraid of an enemy moyo.

Anyway, I feel that the balance on the board gets disturbed by playing moves that give the other player a good direction without compensation - not necessarily because you lose, but because it tends to become an all or nothing game then - white will have to invade at some point - either he dies or he wins, simply put. I prefer to have the game a bit more flexible.]
