C[Hello, I, kevco, am playing black. Thanks in advance for your time and effort!

I won the game because he let me kill a big group towards the end. If he had used move 214, white J14 to make life in the upper right corner and let me capture a small group, I think it would have been a couple point white win.

Sorry for being so late!

This was an interesting game, I enjoyed going through it.
Variations are marked with a (V).
The last commented move is Black 165.

If I should sum up my commentary, it would be like this: Please try to play a little more on territory, think about it even while attacking, defending, simply during the whole game :)]
;B[pd];W[dp];B[pq];W[dd];B[pk];W[po]C[move 6 (w Q5): if I had the star point K4 I would not hesitate to play b O4 and follow joseki. Here I feel that leaves me open for later and I wonder if there is a better choice.

W6 is way too early, and o4 as an answer would be just right.]
;B[qo]LB[qn:B][pp:A]C[So I picked black R5.

Not best, but no move that will lose a game :)

Now, instead of A, White should play B (V).]
(;W[pp]TR[pk]C[This leads to some very complicated josekis with lots of fighting - I am not sure if this is a good choice when Black has a stone like the marked one nearby...]
;B[qp];W[oq];B[pn];W[qq];B[pr];W[qn]LB[rq:A]TR[pk]C[I think this was a white mistake, but I am not sure what would be good for white.

WA is the Joseki (without the marked stone of course).];B[rq]
;W[on];B[pm];W[or];B[qr]C[Very good for Black!];W[np];B[jd]
LB[fc:B][cj:A][cn:C]C[Should I have played P7 or O8 first? Or should I have made an approach in the lower left corner first?

P7 might be possible (although it helps White to solidify his shape, so I wouldn't play it), but O8 is clearly bad - a move with no substance. K16 is fine! BA, BB, BC are also interesting moves.]
;W[fq]LB[dj:B][fp:A]C[Locally, I prefer WA, but WB looks like the move here.]
;B[cj]C[I was not sure about the approach, C10, here. By move 32 white gets quite a strong corner with lots of potential in the bottom center.

Good one :)];W[cl];B[cg];W[ce]LB[gc:C][ej:B][ek:A]C[But your next move, BA, is questionable, I think. In the local context BB is more like it, but how about BC (V)?!]

(;B[ek];W[el];B[fk]LB[fl:A]C[Having played E9, BA now is the continuation (although a dangerous one).]
;W[dk];B[dj];W[fl];B[gk]LB[fp:A]TR[el][fl][fq]C[The marked stones is a little better in securing the corner (and the side), a stone at A is al little better in controlling the outside. After the moves played, it seems you gave White both, the corner and the outside? The marked stones  complete each other.]
;W[qf]LB[hm:A]C[Should be at A.];B[qh]C[Not so sure about this black R12.

You play good moves all the time - trust yourself :)];W[of]
;B[nd];W[pi];B[qi];W[ph];B[pg]LB[qj:A]C[Or pulling back at A.]
;W[qg];B[pj];W[pf]LB[og:A][nh:B]C[WA is correct. Now, Black should play BB (V).]

(;B[jq]LB[nh:A][gl:C][hm:B]C[Is there a better choice here than K3?

I think BA is better (see last moves variation). But since White didn't play WB, BC is a very good point, too.]
;W[hq];B[jo]LB[lp:A]C[BA instead? The played move gives White a nice capping move...]

;W[kp];B[nq];W[ko];B[op];W[kn];B[mf]LB[fc:A][gc:B]C[A or B are looking better.]
;W[qc];B[pc]C[Is there a better result for this coming corner sequence, starting white R17? I wasn't thinking and should have played R16 first, but his response worked out to my initial intention.

In 99 of 100 cases, R16 is the right move, so please play it even when you are not thinking :)]
;W[pb]C[Should be at R16];B[ob]C[This one, too...];W[rb];B[qd]
;W[rd];B[re]C[S15, still not thinking.];W[qe];B[pa];W[qb];B[ng]
LB[cc:C][fc:A][gc:B][bk:D]C[Weak move, O13, I have a bad habit of playing what I know is a bad move when I can't find a good move.

There is a simple rule: if you don't know where to play, take some points! So BA, BB are fine, BC also, and something like BD can't be bad either.]
;W[jj]LB[hc:A]C[Good thinking by White! Although a move around A might have been more valuable.]

No need for further comments, thanks for your help!];W[ar]C[After the next white move, BA7 is not longer sente, so Black should stop here.]
