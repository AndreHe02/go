C[Hi

I would like to have a review for both players. It is a game W won with relatively high difference. Although I am sure there were wrong local moves, the feeling is that some global decisions went wrong, esp. for B. So, as a general perspective, when and how should one decide to make a mid / long term plan?
 Thank you for patience.
p.s. I will prefix our questions with B and W.

TsuQ:
Hi, I'll try to start my comments like this =\]];B[qp];W[dq]
;B[dc];W[qd]TR[dc][dq]C[TsuQ:
This is the only side where both stones are on the "fourth line" relative to the side of the board. So the left side should be played first here because there is more territory to be won and lost.]
;B[jd]
(;W[dj]TR[oc]C[B: W didn't work near the right up corner stone, somehow exposed by K16. Should now go to a kakari approach? From which direction?

TsuQ:
The usual direction to approach, is the same direction white would enclose.]

(;B[pj];W[oc]
(;B[dh]TR[oc][jd][qd][pj]SQ[dj]C[B: is bottom larger move?

TsuQ:
I think my preference would be for the enclosure on the top. Its a bit smaller than the enclosure on the bottom (because the white enclosure is closer to the potential territory on top) but it would place you under the white stones on the left. Usually the 3-4 is played with the idea of making corner enclosures shortly thereafter.

You have agreed on a fighting game by playing diagonal corners, so the amount of total territory available will be less than normal and the corners should be more valuable.

Also considering the relationship between the two stones marked. Playing like this suggests that black is willing to take less territory than white in the same area of the board... It may be better to settle for a similar amount of territory elsewhere, such as on the bottom.]
;W[fj];B[fh];W[op]
(;B[mp]C[B: maybe on line lower?

TsuQ:
One line lower seems better, in this position your stones are pretty much separated already. A space lower and you should have a connection available.]
;W[on];B[qn];W[kp];B[mn];W[ol];B[ql];W[kn]C[B: should B give up the 2 stones for the moment and go to a second pincer?

TsuQ:
I don't think black can afford to play away from these two stones. They are cutting the two white groups, or are at least trying to, without these stones there is no attack on the white stones on either side.]

(;B[oq]
(;W[pq]C[W: can W prevent for sure a cut and isolate the 2 B stones?

TsuQ:
I don't believe so. Cutting on the other side may be slightly better, but should have a similar result.]

(;B[pp];W[nq];B[oo];W[np];B[no];W[or];B[ml];W[oj]
(;B[nj]C[TsuQ:  killing isnt always best - see variation];W[oi]
;B[ok]TR[dc][dh][fh][ml][mn][mp]SQ[dj][fj][kn][kp][dq]C[B: suddenly the W is cut and seems B won the fight. Isn't the price to high? I am referring to the fact that W designs a large moyo in left bottom quarter and maintains a presence in right up.

TsuQ:
Although this leaves more weaknesses in the white position as marked, the cost in the upper right is extensive.]
;W[pk];B[nk];W[qj]TR[oc][qd][oi][pi][oj][pk]C[W: should instead connect?

TsuQ:
No this is absolutely correct. This strength will work very well with the corner enclosure. If you connect you will probably die, or at least have the value of your enclosure reduced.]
;B[pl];W[pi]TR[oa][ob][oc][od][qd][oe][of][og][oh][oi][oj][pj]
[qj][rj][sj]C[TsuQ: After this it's clear killing in this way was a bad choice.]

(;B[do]C[TsuQ:
I'm not sure about this approach, but its difficult to say where is best. I put some options in the variations.]
;W[dm]
(;B[eq]TR[fj][kn]C[B: try to play for 2 directions: either corner or bottom side.

TsuQ:
Be aware where the escape route is as well. you are deep in now, but you can also treat your stones lightly and escape through your opponents territory.]
;W[cp]C[TsuQ: When things look difficult for your stones, consider treating them lightly.]

(;B[co]TR[dj][fj][dm]C[B: decide the corner, hoping that anyway on the side will be maybe space for life

TsuQ:
Ok, this move is difficult because white has defended the corner to some extent in one move. you can't threaten the left side easily because it has a strong shape and access to the center, so this has to be a threat on the corner, or it doesn't work.]
;W[er];B[cr];W[cq]
(;B[bq]C[TsuQ:
Living small in the corner doesn't help reduce the moyo...]
;W[bp];B[dr];W[fr];B[ar]
(;W[bs]C[TsuQ: 
Again, killing isn't always best, even when possible. Consider the variation.]
;B[bo]
(;W[ep]C[B: give up the side for good

TsuQ:
Be aware in this position that the corner is weak, there is roughly half an eye there.]

(;B[fq]TR[ap]C[B: in order to gain some extra threats while establishing the corner and left side.

TsuQ: Usually any threat you get from playing out the ladder exists anyway if you play it directly. A4 seems appropriate instead. White isn't completely secure on the bottom yet, but the more stones he plays there the harder it will be to try to come in later.]
;W[gq];B[dp];W[fp];B[ap];W[eq]
(;B[br]C[TsuQ:
You can only play this with an eye on the outside... See the variation for an alternitive]

(;W[lq]TR[dm][fp][gq][fr]SQ[bm]C[B&W: the moyo in center becomes reality. When is / was the moment to invade / reduce it? Is it important, or B should ignore it? Is the corner fight actually forcing W make such large noyo?

TsuQ:
The corner fight gave white extra strength towards these two stones. The timing of the invasion was correct, but the method was wrong. Living small in the corner gives white strength on both sides. Also a play around square is very big for both sides right now since it's the life or death of the black group in the corner/side.

Ordered goals of an invasion:
Connecting out
Escape to the center

TsuQ:

(;B[hh];W[ce];B[cd]C[B: should give up corner for the center?

C[B: Was g17 too soon, allowing W make life on the side?

TsuQ:
I don't think so, this gives black a nice top side and reduces white. otherwise white will play on the top first.]

;W[na];B[tt];W[tt];B[tt];W[aq]C[Thank you. Any observations are welcome.

TsuQ:
Here why is A3 marked? It's a full point if there's any confusion... B can't be forced to fill it because the black group in the corner has an eye there.

General Advice:
Keep focus on the main objective, marking off territory and preventing your opponent from doing the same. Capturing stones and indeed keeping them alive isn't optimal if it leads to a bad territorial result.

The 3-4 point generally leads to a corner enclosure. There are other moves of course, but ithe enclosures are quite valuable. Try to find time to make them.

The corners and sides are generally more valuable than the center, so try to avoid placing stones above the 4th line until the corners are secure.

I hope it was helpful =\]])
