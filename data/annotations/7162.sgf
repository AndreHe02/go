Reviewer: First question I dont have a good answere for, sorry, but:]
;W[eq];B[fq];W[dq];B[fp]C[Reviewer: Until here it looks good. I would prefer:]

(;W[fr]C[Reviewer: I dont like that move.];B[gr]TR[fr]C[Reviewer: Now black has the opportunity to catpure that stone]
;W[ce]
(;B[cn]C[Reviewer: Good move. If white would have played around there...]

(;W[do]C[Reviewer: Usually its good to try to cut stones. But in this case he has too much space to build eyes. Better is]

;B[ei];W[fi]C[Reviewer:  With the variations below, black gains some influence to the middle and cuts the white stones. White saves territory on the top.
Worst case for white is, getting cought*g*]

SQ[bd][ef][fh][fj][ek][er]C[Reviewer:  No...no :(
Black has too much points in the corners, white has to play somewhere there: (See triangles)
Or at least close some weak poins(see squares)]
(;B[fn];W[fm]
(;B[hq]SQ[pc][md][nd][pf][qf][pn][qn][mp][np][pq]C[Reviewer:  Not necessary, but okay. I`d prefer saving my corners(see square)]

(;W[er]C[Reviewer: Good, protecting a weak point, but: That weak points wouldn't cost very much points, see Var.

protect weak point: +6points.
Attacking the enemy: 10-20points];B[gm]C[Reviewer:  Black is fighting for too less points. White has very much weak points you could use later, for now you should ensure your corners.]

(;W[hn];B[jn]C[Reviewer:  Also the cut make you to defend];W[jj]
;B[qj]SQ[pj]C[Reviewer:  Why so scary? Go to Q10. No reason for being afraid, you are still in an big advantage.]
;W[gl]C[Reviewer:  Fighting for too less points :(];B[hm];W[im]

;B[ic];W[fa];B[jm]TR[kh][mh][lj][nj][ml]C[Reviewer:  No really reason for that move. White still can invade from K10.

Reviewer: Okay, to white:
You should take care of weak points and when you did it, you have to attack. Your attack @triangles was to late, better would have been r3: 

To black: You should abuse your opponents weak points and make territory with them. AND: You have to defend your corners better.

I hope I could help you a little bit and give you some good advises.
