C[Thanks in advance very much for reviewing my game!

In this game, I made no big blunders, and tried to read as well as I could, therefore I think this would be an interesting game for review. I will put some comments here and there.

I played white (WTS) in the game.

;B[pq]C[WTS [5k\]: hello, enjoy this game
Tur1st [6k\]: hi gg

In response to my oppenent's territorial opening on the 3-4 points, I decided I should try to play an influence-oriented game myself, and went for some star points.]
;W[dp];B[qo];W[jp];B[oc];W[dj]C[AB: Good.];B[pj];W[jd]C[AB: Sure it is. At our level we don't win or lose because of tiny opening mistakes.

Is the opening playable until here?];B[jj];W[cc]LB[oe:B][lj:C]
[oo:A]C[AB: Yes, well, you notice it yourself. This move is obviously totally inconsistent with your influence strategy. Again, at our level this is not decisive, but strange nonetheless. There are many alternatives that make more sense, B would probably be my favorite.


Here, I had a hard time deciding where to move. I had no moves left to expand my moyo, and it did not look wise to invade B's position. Therefore I decided to take one corner. I doubt it was a really good move...]
;B[fq]C[Black invades. My strategy was to take territory in the corner and the left side.]
;W[eq];B[fo];W[dn];B[fm];W[dl]C[AB: I don't think this variation is bad for White, the result is quite normal. Keep in mind that you make fourth line territory.



now I realize that maybe things have gone wrong here alread. Suddenly B's moyo has gotten much bigger than mine.

I guess I chose the wrong response to B's invasion. Perhaps I should have use my K4 stone better, and respond with a pincer instead of E3.]
;B[mq]C[AB: Yes, this should not pose too many problems.


Now I'm trying to play lightly inside B's moyo.];W[gp]LB[mp:C]
[gq:B][fr:A]TR[fm][fo][fq]C[AB: I would be careful with moves like this one. It has the taste of aji keshi. Without it you can play moves like A or B later. In any case you correctly target the three marked Black stones. You cannot kill them but you can use an attack to help your own stone. Another idea would be to settle your stone by attaching to Black's strong stone at C. The territory Black will get is small enough.]
;B[fp];W[hm];B[fk];W[hk];B[fi];W[dh]LB[hi:A]C[AB: My intuition tells me that now A would be more appropriate. Clearly Black's stones are stronger than yours and a Black play at A would put you in trouble.]
;B[hn]LB[hi:A]C[AB: A cap at A would be severe.]
(;W[jm]C[AB: I think attaching would be the normal way to strenghten your stones (see variations).]
;B[in];W[kn];B[im];W[kk];B[ik];W[mo]TR[hk][hm]C[AB: I think you gave up the two stones a little bit too easily. Black's profit is not big, but White's stones are still not settled and good shape is still lacking.]
;B[ko]LB[li:E][mk:D][nn:C][oo:A][lq:B]C[AB: Now it is actually Black who comes to help you :-). Contact play is in White's interest here. Black should attack at a larger scale instead. There are many ideas here for Black, but he chose about the worst one.]
;W[jo];B[jn];W[lo];B[lq];W[kq];B[km];W[ln];B[jl];W[ml]LB[lp:A]
C[AB: Good. Now White's shape is much better. Still, Black has A to remove the eye there.]
;B[pl]C[AB: Good play by Black now.];W[mj]C[AB: OK.];B[fc]C[here, again I had a hard time deciding from which direction to attack.]
;W[fe]C[AB: I like your move.];B[ge];W[gd];B[fd];W[gc]
(;B[ff]C[AB: It seems Black must atari from the other side and fight (see variation).]
;W[ee]C[happy to capture B's two stones here.];B[he];W[id]C[AB: The result is excellent for White. White should be leading now.]
;B[ig]C[AB: And sente now as well.];W[oe]LB[oo:A]C[AB: Good point. However, you could also play around A to make your one weak group save.


here I thought it would be good to reduce. I expected a response around Q13, but B chose the other direction.]
;B[lc]LB[pf:A][nn:B]C[AB: Surprising, indeed. I also would expect A. Being behind, Black could also launch an attack on your weak group.]
;W[qf]LB[qe:A]C[AB: Again, contact play is asked for in this kind of situation.]
;B[qh]C[AB: Good move by Black. Your two stones are floating a bit.]
;W[og]C[AB: Necessary.];B[ni]C[AB: Nice double attack now by Black. Last chance for him to catch up.]
;W[me]
(;B[le]C[AB: I think Black could attack more severely (see variations).]
;W[md];B[mc]LB[ld:A]C[AB: Black must fight at A here, in my opinion.]
;W[ld];B[kd];W[ke];B[kc];W[lf]LB[je:A]C[AB: Well, Black can still cut at A right away, but the shape of the White group is good enough. 


I felt B made that easier for me than he should have.]
(;B[fr]LB[mi:A]C[AB: Seems big, but Black must, must attack your weak group now.]

(;W[cq]LB[mi:B][oo:C][dr:A]C[AB: I think D2 is locally good. Helping your weak group with B or C is urgent, though.


I guess C2 would be better? I am taking the corner here because I assumed my center group would be safe, with a connection at M12, or a second eye on the bottom as kind of miai.]
;B[ib];W[ic];B[hb];W[fb];B[gb];W[eb];B[jc]C[AB: A "Thank you" move.]
;W[je]C[AB: Thank you.];B[ef];W[df];B[iq]C[AB: Finally a little bit of attack here.]
;W[ip];B[hq];W[lh]C[AB: Yes!];B[kr]C[AB: Well, yes, but that is the price you had to pay for not helping the weak group for so long.


I hadn't counted on B connecting underneath here, should have looked better... now he takes a lot of points and is leading.]
;W[rg];B[jq];W[kp];B[rh];W[re];B[rd];W[sh];B[si];W[sg];B[rj]
;W[sd];B[sc];W[se]C[AB: Yes, but there was no way Black could prevent that.


Happy to get thesein sente];B[rb]LB[pf:A]C[AB. There is some bad aji at A here.]

(;B[qe]C[AB: There is some bad aji here (see variation).];W[qg]
;B[hp];W[eg];B[fg];W[jh]C[AB: Good.];B[ih];W[ji];B[ii];W[kj]
;B[eh];W[dg];B[lm];W[mm];B[mi];W[li];B[nj];W[nk];B[cm]C[AB: Strange.]
;W[dm];B[ck];W[cj];B[dk];W[ek];B[ej];W[el];B[bj];W[bk];B[di]
;W[ci]C[AB: There is no variation, and I don't see much of anything here.

He could have started a big ko here, luckily he missed it (see variation).]
;B[ei];W[cl]C[AB: Is this even necessary?

misread something and thought I had to connect, oops.];B[ng]
;W[nf];B[oh];W[pg];B[mg];W[lg];B[io]LB[fl:A]C[AB: Seems small. Obviously White can break through at A.]
;W[ph];B[pi];W[mh];B[nh];W[if];B[hf];W[fl]C[AB: Yes, good.

;B[fa];W[ea]LB[ga:A][jb:B]C[AB: If you had lost by half a point, this would have been it. You can throw in at A, which doesn't lose anything. then Black must connect at B later, which gains one point.]

[sr][gs][hs][is][js][ks][ls][ms][ns][os][ps][qs][rs][ss]C[AB: I'm wandering a little bit about why you won only by such a small margin and basically just because of Black's big mistake in the endgame. In the end Black's lower and right side did get quite large. Your only real problem to me was the handling of your weak group in the lower middle. You gave up two stones too easily and without getting shape for the rest of the group. Then you didn't have options of creating more trouble to Black's big area later, because the group was weak throughout the game. You want to play contact moves in the opponent's area of influence. Maybe this is the biggest lesson from this game. Other than that there were some small reading errors but nothing too dramatic. Hope this review was helpful. If you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact me.]
