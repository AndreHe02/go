AB[dd][dj][dp][pd][pj][pp]C[Hi,

I noticed in the game, that you have problems recognizing capping moves. You should start thinking about moves like the cap because it is one of the basic attacking moves in go. Other than that I think you have a good global thinking except for some minor problems when you lose track of the global situation. I wish you all the best and apologize for not being able to finish the whole game.]

R: As you left bad Aji with the Hane it's difficult to say which way is the best way to play (see variation at 25).

B seems to be honte (the honest move, although it is a bit slow) if you want to play more active I'd recommend the splitting move at C]

First thought, playing A seems to attack the big group better and connect your stones to the center.]

Play the capping move at A instead, threatening to play the square point.]
