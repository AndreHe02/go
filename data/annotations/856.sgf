;B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[hd]LB[gc:A]C[The pincer is a good
idea here.  The low
one-space pincer at
A might be a better
choice (a game like this is discussed in Kajiwara's book that I read
recently)];B[cc]C[The inside attachment should be good for white, I think.]
;W[dd];B[dc];W[ee];B[fd];W[fe];B[bd];W[fb];B[be];W[cf]C[black 15 should have been at
white 16, shouldn't it?];B[gc]C[black gets a small territory here while white gets thick.  This is
good for white, and neutralizes the influence of the star-points.]
;W[hc];B[gb];W[gd]C[this move should seal black in at 21
instead.];B[hb];W[ib];B[fc];W[nq]LB[jc:A][co:B][qj:C][qf:D]
C[white's wall has a few too many holes.
I'd be tempted to defend with the hanging connection at A.
The corner enclosure at B or the splitting move at C or the inside approach
at D all look more tempting to me, too.  Approaching at 24 tends to give
black the right side too easily.];B[jp];W[no]C[Here the double approach move
looks more tempting.  Again, you don't want to give black the right side
too easily.];B[pn];W[gp]C[Black is naturally going to secure the right side in this
fight, and you're going to end up wishing you had closed the corner earlier
(and played 28 one point to the right)];B[mp];W[np];B[pq]LB[lo:A]
C[31 is not urgent yet; black is too thin on the left.  White
won't be jumping into the corner right away anyway.  Black should play at
A, I think.];W[om]LB[ln:A]C[This gives black too much territory on the
right; white should lean the other way, around A
perhaps.];B[cl]LB[pm:A][on:B]C[This is crazy; black should play at A (calm) or
B (to start a fight, push through and cut)  Tenuki is not an option
here.];W[jn]LB[pm:A]C[This should probably be at A to punish black
for the tenuki.
But the general idea is right, ignore black's previous move and pay
attention to the fight.];B[kn];W[pm]C[Good, you get to this point
soon.];B[in]C[Black has to make life here but there's nowhere useful for
this group to go.  Still, the white stone here looks bad now, so the trade
of moves here was not a good idea.  Just block black
immediately.];W[qo]LB[qf:A][jm:B]C[Black's corner gets small here but it's not going to
die.  A play at A looks bigger, or play B to start a complicated
fight.];B[qp];W[qn];B[qr]C[When black plays a move like this white should feel
happy.];W[rq]C[Even if black might die here, unless you can read it out to
the end you should save it for later and hope that black spends another
move to defend this group.];B[rp];W[or];B[rr];W[jo]LB[jm:A]
C[This move looks a
little too aggressive.  Maybe just A instead.
On the other hand your group on the right has gotten strong so you can
afford to be pretty aggressive here.];B[io];W[ko]LB[kp:A][jm:B]
C[Now you back
off.  If you're going to be agressive this move has to be at A, cutting
black in two severely.
I still think B would have been better to begin with.];B[kp]
;W[lo];B[hp]LB[dm:A]C[At this point it looks like white has spent a lot of moves to
catch one black stone that wasn't so important after all.  White should be
thinking of chasing the whole group on a large scale.  The shoulder hit at
A might have been a good way to start.  Think big in this kind of fight!]
;W[hq];B[co]C[Black tenukis again ... now you really need to chase
this group effectively.];W[go]LB[iq:A]C[A peep at A first might be
good.];B[iq];W[gq];B[il]LB[jo:?][ko:?][lo:?][jm:A]C[Now you see that running out this way was
the important direction, and your moves at ? were not so important.  A
stone at A would be much nicer now!];W[gl]C[Chasing the group is a good
idea.];B[jm]C[This makes pretty good shape for black and your stones below
might get short of liberties.];W[hm]C[Probably a good peep.  Black might peep at your connection if you
don't go here.];B[im];W[lp]LB[jj:A][ln:B]C[THis move is small.  The black stone you are
cutting off was a forcing move, so it can be sacrificed easily.  Black
should jump out to A now.
Also your stones here have only three liberties!
A move which gains them some liberties like B might be better.
But I think the best idea is to chace the whole black group with a move
around A yourself, or maybe one line
farther.];B[lq];W[mq];B[ln];W[mo]C[you gave black a lot of
forcing moves here, and all you accomplished was capturing a forcing stone
(not worth much)];B[pj]LB[ph:A][qg:B]C[This is too close to white's wall.  An invasion around A will hurt
black later.  If black is going to play on this side it should be held back
to around B.];W[ll]LB[jj:A]TR[kn][ln]C[This is aimed at the two marked black stones; they
are forcing stones, not important.  Black can sacrifice them and play
around A.];B[jc]LB[ic:A]C[This is a small move for black, just taking a
few points of territory, but later the cutting points in your wall might
hurt.  It would have been nice shape for white to have a stone here.

Since the ladder is broken black could have cut directly at A, couldn't he?]
;W[ij]LB[ph:A]C[This is the right direction.  Black is in for a tough fight now,
and later after you build up strength you can invade around A.]
;B[kk];W[km]LB[lk:A][mj:B]C[This is tiny!  Play at A or B to attack the whole
group.   The two stones are not worth more than a few points.
Also remember you want to build up strength to invade the right side later.]
;B[ic]LB[mj:A][li:B][ki:C]C[Another small move for black.  White should ignore
again and play at A or B or C or the like.];W[je];B[md]LB[mj:A]
C[Another small move for black; playing
around A is good for white now.];W[kc]LB[ph:A][cp:B]C[This is small for white;
just takes away a few points of territory for black.  The black group in
the lower middle is the only urgent thing on the board now.
White's strategy should be to build up strength by attacking it and then
invade around A.
If white is just thinking of territory, B is bigger than the move white
played here.];B[jb];W[mj]C[Here is the key point for white.
Nice move!];B[kl];W[lm]LB[ml:A]C[Hm, white connecting takes away a fraction of a black eye here, but
even if black captured white A would still work ... so maybe white can try
to seal black in instead.];B[ki];W[lj];B[kj];W[lh]LB[ph:A]C[This is the correct direction; A looks
like a great move for white whenever the time
comes.];B[hk];W[fj];B[gk];W[fk];B[hi];W[ii]LB[ge:A][ph:B][cp:X]
[do:Y][cj:Z]C[Hm, this might be a bit much to hope for; black is getting life
now, probably, and you don't want to hurt the cutting point at A too badly
by trying to save these stones.

Instead, attack at B, or play white X-black Y-white Z at the left.
B is more urgent, XYZ is good for later.];B[ih];W[jh];B[ji]
;W[hj];B[ig];W[gj]C[A
powerful cut for white.];B[kh];W[jg];B[kg];W[jf]LB[cp:X][do:Y]
[cj:Z][ph:A][ro:B]C[This looks VERY good for white, having made a big territory at the
top left center now.
X-Y-Z sequence is looking even better; taking territory as well as keeping
black weak.  Still invade at A first though.
Maybe the forcing move at B would be good
too.];B[lg];W[mg];B[mf];W[mh];B[le];W[pg]C[Perfe
ct!  White has strength here so black can't do anything with the marked
stone.
It looks like a good game for white now.];B[ql];W[qc]C[This is an unnecessary overplay.  Killing black on the right
side is more important.  Playing here will give black stones to help on the
right side.];B[qd];W[pc];B[oc]LB[nc:A]C[In the presence of the marked stone black can play a tesuji
at A instead to take sente here.];W[ob];B[nb];W[rd];B[re];W[qe]
;B[pe];W[rc]TR[qe][pe]C[Playing the
marked stone and then leaving it is a gift for black ... black gets a free
extra stone at the marked point, which helps his shape.];B[qf]
;W[nc];B[od];W[mb];B[qh]C[This exchange is very very bad for white.  White
got a small life in the corner and in return black took away white's entire
right-hand side.
The three-three point invasion was probably the losing move for white.  All
that strength in the center is now almost useless.];W[bp]C[A little thin to
play here; you need to play moreseverely to make black answer locally.]
;B[ci]C[A great move by black.  Now white has nowhere to make a big territory.]
;W[cm]C[White needs to catch something big.];B[bm];W[bl];B[cn]
C[black should atari the other way and squeeze white.];W[dm]
;B[bk];W[bn];B[al];W[bo]C[White catches a few points in the lower
left, but in gote, so it's not big enough.
The game is close at this point.];B[eh];W[di];B[dh];W[cj];B[gh]
C[Now the weakness of white's wall above
might get serious.];W[ch];B[cg];W[bi]TR[bk][cl][bm][al]C[black's group below has just died!!
white just needs to live now ... quite a turning point in the game.]
;B[df];W[kd]C[Good idea, trying to link up to the live corner group ...]
;B[lb];W[bg]C[... or the live side group ...];B[dg];W[fg];B[fh]
;W[de];B[bf];W[hg]C[now the game is a confused fight; looks like either
side could win or lose in a big way depending on the outcome here.]
;B[gg]C[this forcing move seems to help white's shape more than black's.
Better to just connect I think.];W[hf];B[hh];W[ce];B[gf];W[ge]
;B[if];W[jd]LB[ie:A]C[playing at A instead gives you some chance of winning the capturing
race here.
It's hard to read out.
It might end up seki, but that would be OK because you have already
captured a huge area in the lower left.];B[he];W[kb];B[mc]C[Now your corner group can be killed with one move.]
;W[ka]C[This is a clever double threat move.];B[ma];W[ia];B[ie]
;W[id];B[ff]TR[ie]C[Unfortunately black gets two eyes
and white has only one, so black wins the game.
This shows why white had to play at the triangled point so that when black
captured, white could recapture, preventing the eye.];W[pa]
;B[qm];W[po];B[ng]LB[rn:A]C[Linking up to the corner at A might be bigger.]
;W[rm];B[rl]C[A good forcing exchange for white here.];W[nh]
;B[oh];W[pi];B[oi];W[qj]C[White is trying to stir up trouble to make up for the big loss ...
But black is about 10 points ahead even if white manages to destroy this
territory.];B[pk];W[oj];B[ph];W[lr];B[kq]C[saving this stone is small for black;
play a big endgame move instead...];W[ir]C[white gets another good point, but black is way ahead.]
;B[jr];W[hr];B[ag];W[ah];B[bh];W[ja];B[jc];W[bg];B[ra];W[rb]
;B[bh];W[eb];B[db];W[bg]C[The lesson here:  keep attacking when there's a weak group to be
attacked, and use the strength to invade.
Don't get distracted until you're sure the stones are dead; the 3-3
invasion cost you a lot.
Black let the fight on the left side into the center get complicated and
gave you a chance to catch up, but then you missed the crucial move to take
away the eyes and black lived, white died.])
