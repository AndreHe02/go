C[Hi Philippe,

My comments in the file are preceded with "N:". I hope you find the review useful. Our rank is not that much different (I am around 3-4k on KGS, so don't take my comments as definite rules. Also, this is my first review on GTL so please try to be understanding. Finally, feel free to contact me at nroussos@gmail.com with your feedback for my review. I would like to hear from you.

Thanks
Nicholas

PS. A good book is "Attack and Defense" by Ishida (Kiseido - K14).


==================================================
Dear reviewer,

In this game I was black and I won the game by resignation. There were some some difficults decisions however for me to make in the early middlegame. The game went well for me but there is certainly improvements I can make.

Specifically, I am hoping you can help me with advice on attack and defense and on making good shape.

I left my comments to let you know what I was thinking at different stages in the game.

Thank you,

Philippe];B[pd];W[dq];B[pp];W[cd];B[ed];W[nq];B[pn];W[kp]
(;B[do]LB[cc:A]C[N: Another idea would be to play the top left corner at this point (you can always come back to D5 later). See variation.

At this stage I thought of playing for power.];W[fp]
(;B[ck]LB[co:2][cp:1][cq:A]C[Not sure this move was best but it seemed better than going in the corner right away with A (C3)
-----------------------------------------------------------

N: See the variations for usual josekis. The move at C9 seems to be playable even after you play the joseki, as white would want to complete the sequence rather than risking to lose the corner. Remember that in order of importance we have corners, then sides and finally the centre.

C9 seems too passive at this moment, and allows the move at 1 or 2(?) for white to get the corner profit.

White could even fight by playing at C7 I think. (See variation - also ask stronger players).]

(;W[cg]C[N: I feel that this white move is not good at this time. It definitely protects the corner, but is kind of gentle on the black stone just played.]
;B[cq]LB[ic:A]C[N: I tend to agree with you on playing C3. See next comment in move 15.
Also, the move at J17 would have been there if you first played the joseki mentioned in previous comment before playing D5.

Maybe a move on the upper side around A (J17) could also be good?

But helping this group make a bigger base seemed more urgent.]
;W[cr];B[cp]C[N: So you played the Joseki after all, but in the wrong sequence. That means you could have played it from the beginning. Perhaps white could punish by taking the corner instead of C13.]

(;W[fn]
(;B[mo]LB[kn:A][pr:B]C[My thinking was to prevent white from making a huge moyo at the bottom.
------------------
N: And does this move prevent white from making a huge moyo at the bottom? Has white not already formed a huge moyo? Can white not still play A or B (he played B).

See also the variation for move 17. Perhaps this would help you avoid becoming overconcentrated, and also sketch a moyo comparable to white's. I think your bottom right corner would still be invadeable, but it would be early to worry about that.]
;W[pr];B[qq]C[Maybe black is slightly overconcentrated now in the bottom right, but at the time that seemed the best alternative.]
;W[qi]C[N: Now white has the opportunity to play in this area first.]
;B[qk]LB[qf:A]C[N: Since your bottom right group is already quite thick, you might consider playing at A first. This way you strengthen  your corner at the same time as attacking white.]
;W[qf];B[qe]C[N: Good move, forcing white to form non-ideal shape.]
;W[pf]C[N: two stones, jump 3. White cannot follow the proverb, and gets a concentrated shape.]
;B[nc];W[hd]C[White gets this move and pressures my black stone.

I hesitated a lot on the best continuation in the upper left. Any thoughts are most welcome.
-----------------------------

N: To this move I would play C17 to get good shape.The contact play at D13 seems a horrible move to me, and if white would exploit it he would become stronger (he replied a bit passively). 

Also, I was thinking of K17.]
(;B[dg]C[Contact play to defend.]
(;W[ch];B[jd]LB[jc:A]C[N: This is definitely good, pressing white's stone. Maybe K17?]
;W[ec]LB[ee:A]C[This move by white does not seem best?

White A (E15) would have given me more trouble for example.
-----------------------

N: White is trying to keep the corner I believe. And I think I would prefer this to A, as this would aim at gaining influence.]
;B[fc];W[dc];B[fd];W[hf]C[N: So like this white protects the corner, and also you have formed thickness which is however enclosed in white's area (or almost enclosed). You helped enclosing it by playing G15.]

(;B[ge];W[he];B[fg];W[jf];B[ld]LB[hc:A]C[I thought defending was best.

N: What were you defending? Territory? I think White can still cause trouble by the move at A, so you would need for defending to keep that territory. Plus, after an exchange at A, white can chase your overconcentrated group. See variation.]

(;W[lf];B[df]C[Again defense seemed urgent.];W[cf];B[ei]C[More defending seemed appropriate.]
;W[dj];B[dk]C[White does a good job to split black.];W[ej];B[hh]

(;W[ig]LB[ki:A]C[Not sure about this move by white?

Now I thought it was time to tenuki and counter attack elsewhere on the board.
------------------

N: Well, white has not yet secured his group, so we might be a bit worried to play elsewhere. Even so, J13 seems a bit too passive to me. I was thinking a move like A, (see variation). This still helps to secure the group, but also attacks the black group. Dual purpose is always best.]
;B[iq]C[Not sure this is the best invasion point but it does split white at the bottom.

Invading on the 4th line did not seem best since I did not want to have a floating group in this area.]

(;W[kr];B[fq]
(;W[eq]C[N: White could have responded a bit differently. But your invasion seems to work fine the way the game was played.]
;B[fr];W[eo]C[White protects against the cut];B[gp];W[go];B[hp]
C[In my view black is not yet unconditionnaly alive at the bottom, but the aji is enough to bother white.

N: At this point, I think Black should not have a problem to either live by forming 2 eyes, or to escape and connect.]

(;W[bj]C[Seems more like an endgame move.

N: Indeed. But it also threatens to get in your territory and attack the black group.]
;B[bk]C[I was happy to solidify.

N: Correct. And you now have B11 so white needs defense here.]
;W[dm];B[cm];W[kc]C[Interesting move by white, I was a bit puzzled on the best response.]

(;B[ic]TR[fc][ed][fd][ge][df][dg][fg][hh][ei]C[I liked this move since it brought my black group in the upper left one move from connecting and prevented white from connecting.

N: As already shown in the variation, connecting at L16 seems to be more solid, even though you are correct that it does not connect your groups. Though the marked grop has access to the centre.]
;W[kd]C[N: This cut already seems ugly.];B[ke]C[Sacrifice...]
;W[le];B[lc]C[Protecting the upper right seemed most important.]
;W[je];B[kb];W[kf]C[White gains some thickness and black 2nd line territory.

I was still happy witht the exchange since I had sente and was 1 move away from connecting my weak group in the upper left.]
;B[oj]LB[in:A]C[Seemed to be the biggest move

N: Perhaps a move around A to get your bottom group towards the centre, while also attempting to press the white group?]
;W[oi];B[nj];W[nn]TR[gp][hp][fq][iq][fr]C[Another interesting move by white.

It will erase much of my potential moyo territory but I saw an opportunity to help my black group (triangled stones).]
;B[no];W[ml];B[lm]LB[kn:A]C[N: Attacking like this helps white get stronger. Avoid the shoulder hit when attacking a weak group. Maybe A would be better.]
;W[ll]
(;B[ko];W[lp]
(;B[lo]C[N: This move is too submissive.. You fear not a cut here. See variation.]
;W[jo]C[White spends a move to prevent black from connecting.

Now I have to live at the bottom.
--------------------------------------------

N: This would be prevented if you had played here first :) The only cost: 2 stones.]
;B[er];W[dr]
(;B[es];W[hr]C[N: Key point.];B[ir]LB[gs:C][is:A][js:B]C[I feared the ko with white A (J1) black B (K1) white C (G1).

N: See variation. I think that you need not enter the ko and you could easily get at least seki.]

(;W[jr]C[I do not think this can work for white.];B[is];W[gr]
;B[gs];W[hs];B[gq];W[fs];B[hq]C[Strange shape for black, but black is alive.

At this stage I thought black could win the game.

--------------------

N: Black is safe. This shape does occur. Note that this makes a nice ko threat under chinese rules where suicide is allowed. White gets to play G1, killing its stones and threatening to play G1 under the stones if black ignores the ko threat and doesn't play there.]
;W[ol];B[pk];W[qr]C[It seems we are now in the endgame.];B[rf]
;W[qc]C[Mistake by white, he can not live unconditionnaly.

N: This invasion came a bit too late.];B[re];W[ob];B[nb];W[oc]
;B[od];W[rb];B[oa];W[qa];B[rd];W[pc];B[rc];W[rj];B[rk];W[rq]
;B[rp];W[rr];B[fb]C[With sente I wanted to secure my black group first while threatening a monkey jump.]
;W[eb];B[ni]C[Now I attack while erasing some potential white territory.

N: While you have the lead, it's a good decision to slowly erase some territory and keep your lead without risking.]
;W[oh];B[nh];W[nf];B[ho]C[More erasing];W[hn]
(;B[km]C[Some defending, while preventing white to connect on the left. Not sure about the timing of this move.

N: I cannot see something bad with the timing.];W[pm]
(;B[qn];W[lj];B[fj];W[ek];B[rh];W[sp];B[so];W[sq];B[ro];W[bq]
LB[rh:A]C[Mistake by white in my view. Answering black A (S12) seems bigger.]
;B[bp];W[br]
(;B[aj]LB[bi:A]C[N: I think the move at A could be considered.]
;W[bi];B[og]C[Bad shape for white and captures...];W[ng];B[pg]
;W[qg];B[qh];W[of];B[ph]C[Black is confortably ahead I believe.]
;W[bn]
(;B[bm];W[al];B[ak];W[am];B[dn];W[em];B[hc]C[With black having sente again, I can play this big move.]

;W[ii];B[hi];W[ij];B[hj];W[hl];B[lh];W[ki];B[on];W[nm];B[il]
LB[hk:A][jl:B]C[N: So you lost sente by playing this. You could leave it as is. The stone can connect by playing A or B later if need arises.]
;W[qm];B[rm];W[rg];B[sg];W[de];B[ee];W[ap];B[ao];W[aq];B[bo]
;W[hk];B[im];W[in]
(;B[kl];W[dh];B[eh];W[kh];B[gf]LB[nd:A]C[Mistake by black, I should have protected against the cut at A (O16).

N: Would be a good idea. You remove any opportunities from black to play around and try to save the group on the top right corner.]
;W[lg];B[li];W[md];B[mc]LB[nd:A]C[Better to play at A (O16) and let white make a few points.

White will then start a ko which gives him a chance to get back in the game.]
;W[nd];B[ih];W[kk];B[jj];W[ji];B[jk];W[kj];B[pi]C[Sice I was leading and expected a ko, in the upper right, this defensive move seemed appropriate.]
