C[Tyrus [1k\]: hi, viel spa√ü!

hello dear reviewer. thanks a lot for commenting my game!
i played this game on KGS as black  where i play as 1k at the moment. i need some general advice to improve my strategic decisions especially in the middle game. although this game definately was no masterpiece of mine, i chose it because it used to be the most balanced one i played on kgs since quite a long time. usually i have wins or losses eigther by resignation or by a larger amount of points.

Comments by Az];B[qd]C[kimba [1k\]: hi - have fun];W[dp];B[pq]
;W[dd];B[oc];W[qj];B[qn]C[i like to have to shimaris that way]
;W[qg];B[fq]TR[jq]C[Az: I suppose it's a matter of style, but I would prefere to extend on the bottom instead of playing kikari immediately since playing here forces W to pincer.]
;W[hp];B[fo];W[dn];B[kp];W[er]LB[fr:A][iq:B]C[i didn't expect this. was my respond ok?

Az: I think I would prefere to block directly instead jumping out first, since if W plays 'a' it's really huge. Answering at 'a' might seem a little heavy, but afterward you have the option to play at 'b' if you get in trouble, so I think it would be ok.]
;B[fm];W[dl];B[fr];W[kq];B[jq];W[lq];B[jp]C[looks ok for me, doesn't it?

Az: I don't like this for W, black seems fine]
(;W[mo]LB[nq:A]C[Az: This move is strange. For sure W must have a stone at 'a' first....]
;B[nq]C[looks like a vital point

Az: Yup];W[mq];B[nr];W[mm];B[ln];W[mn];B[kl]C[correct direction?

Az: Seems necessary. Black isn't making much profit here, but the group is a little thin if black doesn't defend.]
;W[mk]LB[fc:A]C[Az: Seems a little bit early to start a fight on the right. N9 helps W get much stronger, so it's not clear how fighting will benefit you. I would suggest tenuki in favor of a big point like 'a']
;B[pk];W[qk]LB[pl:A]C[Az: For sure black must continue here at 'a', letting W hane at the head of your stones is too much.]
;B[pj]C[not good, is it? i thought that kept the groups more divided than Q8 but in the upcoming fight the opposite was revealed.]
;W[pl]C[Az: Now it's hard for B to get a good result locally no matter what he does...]
;B[ql];W[qm];B[rl];W[pi];B[nj];W[ol];B[oi];W[rm];B[qi];W[rk]
C[even worse for me if w had played atari first

Az: Correct, W should force first, but it's still a big sucess for him]
;B[rj];W[sl];B[ph];W[qq];B[qr];W[rq];B[qp]C[maybe better S2?

Az: Yes. W is alive with perfect shape, so W has nothing to loose, whereas the ko is all or nothing for black.]
;W[rp];B[ro];W[pp];B[po];W[qo];B[lp];W[mp];B[qp];W[op];B[rr]
;W[qo];B[dq]C[Az: The threat isn't so big, but I don't see a better one for black]
;W[oq];B[pr]
(;W[or]C[Az: This move is unneccesary for W and doesn't make much sense, see variation.]
;B[qp];W[ri]LB[pd:A]C[Az: This does not deserve to be called a ko threat. W should play something like 'a']
;B[qo];W[qh];B[ep]LB[eq:A]C[is this the proper move?

Az: I think 'a' is better, since it gives W much less ability to make any sente moves in the corner and has about the same potential for followup]
;W[cp];B[cq]LB[ci:A]C[Az: Too small. The board is wide open, this is a yose move. It's very big yose, but it doesn't affect the life and death of either group (at least not very directly). I would expect W to answer at 'a']
;W[bq];B[br];W[bp];B[fc];W[hd];B[cc]LB[fe:A][cf:B]C[is A better?

Az: What about 'b'? Going into the corner seems awfully good for W, but a running battle also gives him a chance to build up the left side.]
;W[cd];B[dc];W[ed]LB[gc:A][bc:B]C[Az: If memory serves correctly, 'a' is one joseki followup. 'b' might also be feasible here as a way to try to take sente to reduce the left]
;B[ec];W[fd];B[gc]C[seems necessary

Az: Yeah];W[di];B[gd];W[ge];B[he];W[gf];B[hf];W[gg];B[hg];W[gh]
;B[pg]C[Az: Good direction. W has more profit, but B has a lot more potential. I would prefere to play black at this point]
;W[id]C[Az: Overplay. This is unreasonable, W needs to have more finese than this.]
;B[kd]LB[ld:A]C[Az: Is this better at 'a'? (I don't know...)]
;W[je];B[jg];W[ke];B[ld];W[kg];B[jh];W[kh];B[ji];W[le]C[Az: Heavy, W has a lot of better options than this]
;B[lj]C[Az: *Very* important move];W[md];B[mc];W[nd];B[nc];W[mi]
;B[mj];W[ng]
(;B[oe]C[Az: I don't think there is any way to kill W. W doesn't have two eyes in the middle, but he can make a second along the top, so rather than try to kill (and use up sente moves) I think it's better to take k17 in sente and move on.]
;W[nf];B[ne];W[me];B[jc];W[od];B[pd];W[ki];B[kj];W[li]C[Az: Now W is alive for sure, so time to tenuki and save the ko threats for a rainy day]
;B[nh];W[mh];B[jf]C[did i fight correctly here?

Az: Basicly, though you burned some aji.];W[lg]C[w];B[gj];W[fl]
;B[gl];W[fk];B[gk];W[eo];B[fj]C[is this tenuki really better or should i have answered e3?

Az: I think black should answer E6, then D2 (reduces the forcing value of a2 for white). Unless you know how you're going to punish if he ignores it's not a good idea to give up solid cash]

C[here i first cut then thought];W[dk]
(;B[bc]C[Az: The stone at D13 has some aji yet: because of it the hane should be your sente. Tenuki is very serious for W]
;W[bd];B[ad];W[ae];B[ac];W[bf];B[es];W[dr];B[os];W[hi]LB[ib:A]
[rf:B]C[Az: Curious, this is rather small. 'a' and 'b' are both much bigger]
;B[rh];W[pi];B[np];W[qi];B[oo];W[ij];B[jj];W[ik];B[il];W[jk]
;B[jl];W[kk];B[ll];W[pf]C[i should have played here

Az: Yes];B[lk];W[nk]C[Az: This is so small, W needs to work on his endgame]
;B[ic]C[Az: Huge];W[re];B[rd];W[em];B[fn];W[ej]C[Az: I know I'm commenting for black, not white, but this is really bad.]
;B[gi];W[hh];B[ml];W[nm];B[nl]LB[kr:A]C[Az: Doesn't make sense... 'a' is the biggest move]
;W[ok];B[pe];W[rf];B[kr]C[looks big

Az: It is, bigger than Q15];W[lr];B[jr];W[lo];B[ko];W[lm];B[kn]

i count 5 ko threads for each side(circle b, square w),
since i can capture first i should be able to win.

(white wins by 0,5 points)

Az: Actually, I think black looses either way since G7 is not a point, so the ko only determines whether black looses by 0.5 or 1.5.

Fairly good game, the only reason black was down a bit going into the endgame was because of E3.

If you have any more questions, although I can't promise correct answers, I'd be happy to try to answer them.
