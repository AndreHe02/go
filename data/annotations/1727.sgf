C[Hi

Thanks for reviewing my game

I (niklaus, white in that game) a'm still a beginner (30 k on IGS), and my opponent (29*k) didn't seem very strong either, so I hope you don't die laughing about our errors.
I don't often play on the Internet, and my opponents in real life all play Go since I taught it to them, and I still win most of the time, which doesn't help much in improving my skill. I hope you can tell me where and why I played really bad, maybe even if my opponent didn't punish me.

Hi Niklaus-

My name is Barry Willey and I live in Galveston, Texas, USA.   My email is bcw0404@yahoo.com.  If you have any further questions or would like for me to review another game please drop me an email.    I am about a 19k on IGS and 11k on NNGS.  I started learning go about 2 1/2 years ago, but unfortunately haven't been playing much lately.  You might want to try reading these comments with the "next move" indicator turned on in your sgf viewer.

Its funny, you mention that you hardly play on the net, while  I play almost exclusively on the internet.  Its nice in  that one can get games from many different types of players and it helps find your weaknesses, but I only play so much on the internet because a lack of players where I live.    Also, many players will play a teaching game with you if you just ask.  Try KGS or NNGS, most people are generally friendly there.

I'm am sorry for taking so long to review the game, but after it was sent to me I had a few mini crisis at work and just forgot to get back to your game.  I apologize.]

(;W[fc];B[cf];W[kp]C[w10 at L4 doesn't require black to answer and leaves 8 in a weak position.]

(;B[cn]C[Instead of 13 at c6, black could have moved at f16
see var.];W[pk]C[I think the pupose of this move was to establish a base on the side.  Why not follow it up?]
;B[qm];W[em]C[I think 16 should have been at r12.  You need to establish a base for you stones.  The move at e7 is just asking to be cut.

Looking at the board I would say black is in pretty good shape.  Black has some good territory started, but you have good potential for influence in the middle.

I have found that turning such influence into territory is very challenging, especially at you level.  I think that 3 basic rules for beginners in the openings are:
1. Start from the corners
2. After the corners, go for the sides.
3. Use the third and fourth lines.];B[rp];W[bo]C[So far it doesn't look too bad for me, B has more secure territory in the corners and I have more influence.

reviewers note:  remember to take care of your stones that you have played and don't waste moves.  make you stones work together.  The bottom left looks good for white, but black's groups are very solid and he can use that stregth in attacking you.]
;B[dl];W[cm]C[This move wasn't that great I guess, I should have played somewhere around E6. I wanted to separate his stones and kill the lower one, which didn't really work.

R:  your right.  I don't think this was the best move; however, once you realized it you should have let this stone go.]
;B[dm];W[bn]C[Baaad move, I should have played D6, but I was scared of him attacking C7 but this move didn't help a lot against that.

I'm not sure d6 would have worked out much better for you, c7 was the real mistake.]
;B[dn];W[cl];B[el];W[gn]C[g6 is a little to loose.  black can still invade and cause problems.  Why not contine with the line of stones along c ?]
;B[fm];W[en];B[fn];W[eo];B[gm];W[hn]C[h6 was a bad move.  It allows you to be split and gives your  opponent a giant opening to attack. this ruins the territory you were building on the bottom left. You should hav e blocked at f5.]
;B[fo];W[fp];B[go]C[w at g4 instead of h5 this give you some solid territory on the bottom. Remeber, choose profit over glory.  see var.]

;B[fl]C[This was a bad move for black.  If he wanted to protect that corner he could have played at f9 ging him better shape.  I would have kept attacking on the bottom. see var.]

(;W[nq]C[Nice move.  Gives your stones some form.  But you stones along h are vulnerable.]
;B[oq];W[nn]C[I think 54  at o6 was a little too loose.  Black could have made a very severe move at o4.  See var.]

(;B[hp];W[ip];B[iq];W[jq]C[b should have desended to j2 instead of capturing with h2.]

;W[lk];B[lj];W[co]C[This was a very small move.  Always try to look for the biggest move, or one that will give you sente, i.e. a move to which your opponent must respond.  Even if you had not moved there, you could have easily blocked if black connected.]
;B[eh];W[ei]C[I tried to kill the big black group on the lower side, didn't work though. Was this impossible or did I fuck up?

R:  I think it was impossible.

If you are not sure you can kill a group, just try to keep it on the run and build a strong position while you do it.  This kind of leads in to general rule in whihc you should try to make moves that have a dual  purpose, such   attacking you opponent and and making territory for your self or strengthening your on position.]

Perhaps not.  You had the chance for a ko battle and may have saved the group.  see var.]

(;B[ab];W[bc];B[bf];W[ac];B[ae];W[ag];B[bg];W[ah];B[fj]C[you played a good game even though you lost.  I would recommend working on the following things.

1.  I think you may want to experiment a little with you opening.  Judging from this game you seem to like playing an influence based game.  I personally find these type of openings more complicated and harder to play properly.  You may want to get a little more experience first.
2.  Look for the big move.  You played several small moves to which your opponent did not even have to respond.

3.  Try to find moves that serve a dual purpose.

4.  Don't try to save all your stones.  If a few stones have served their purpose and they are not critical, let them go.

5. Consider the shape of the stones and try to make them work together.  i.e. the tiger's mouth.

Thanks for the opportunity to review the game.  If you have any questions on my comments or other games please feel free to contact me at the email address in the beginning of the review.

Good luck.

P.S.  My daughter wanted to know where you live?  Could you email me and let me know.  Thanks.]
