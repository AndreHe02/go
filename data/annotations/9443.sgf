GTL comments:

Hi,
thx for reviewing my game!
Main focus should be opening and mid game i think. Something like: when should i invade? Do i have to invade or can i keep expanding myself?

this feels a little weird. Am i too passive?

*I guess it is playable, weird because it is same joseki in other corner?

you can always ignore C14 and go straight to R/O14.

or you could play B15 here and see if his left side become more concentrated. but it is important to get out of this corner with sente, as in the game.]
;B[bd];W[cc];B[ef]
(;W[qf]C[*is this the correct direction to approach. this in addition to the choice in the top left corner really determine the flow of the whole game (even though we are only 22 moves in)]
;B[nc];W[rd];B[qc];W[of]C[GTL comments:

i thought i can build a framework myself instead of attacking...

*game is very peaceful so far. it will come down to who can build more efficiently or reduce more effectively from here. B having sente with this developement is huge. Although there are big moves on both top and bottom of the board, B gets one of them right now and you will need to finish the resulting sequence of urgent moves in sente.]

(;W[jc]C[GTL comments:

i guess this was bad. i didnt want to give him top side....

*yes, his H15 is damaging response];B[he]
(;W[md]C[*you have to save C17 group eventually, H18 here might be a better choice than waiting to save them in pure gote]
;B[mc];W[lc];B[nd];W[me]C[*again, this helps b get stronger. maybe M18 was better than his game move.]

i was scared for my group. did i have to play there?

*it seems prudent although painful];B[kd];W[ib];B[jd];W[kc]
;B[hb];W[ja];B[ld];W[mb];B[nb];W[la]C[GTL comments:

not a good result i guess... left a cut and have to sacrifice n15]
;B[ne];W[nf];B[mf];W[mg];B[le]C[GTL comments:

but i have sente...

*bottom middle has been last big point for a while. M13 also quite big now ..]
;W[lq]TR[mo][jp][lp]C[GTL comments:

dont like this one :(.  Maybe these alternatives?

*no complaint, other moves can be considered, but this is a good move locally. If there is a way to get sente in this sequence so you can also play M13 it will be very good for you even if you don't make much profit on the bottom.]
;B[mq];W[lo];B[jq];W[nn]C[*M2 first to pressure K3 is a good idea]
;B[lg];W[mh];B[lh];W[li];B[ki];W[lj];B[kj]C[GTL comments:

i dont know what else i can do instead of following him :/

*yep, this is the trade-off for getting M3];W[kk];B[oj]
(;W[mk]C[*hard to see B's probe working  .. you could try being aggressive here instead of continuing to follow his lead. it would be a bit of a gamble]
;B[jk];W[jl];B[kl];W[lk];B[ik]C[*here is last chance for M2, costly to let him push K8, but still a net positive for you]

(;W[il];B[hl];W[hm];B[gm];W[gl];B[hk];W[gn]C[*H6 maybe better. unless he would fall for J7 trap play]
;B[fm];W[in];B[lr]C[GTL comments:

sad. i wanted to play m2 mayself but couldnt find the moment. I also didn find the timing to invade or reduce his moyo :(.

*yes, it is too late by now, and the blunder at Q15 seals the deal.]

that was me being dumb... i thought im behind and can do this but it was obv bad ^^. I think the rest doesnt really matter..


Thanks a lot!

*yes, this made it more obvious, but by this time the game was already done. Too far behind with territories too secure to make a yose comeback.]
