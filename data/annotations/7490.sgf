I am able to notice some mistakes in my play, but once I make mistakes, I tried to make some influence for compensation...
But I don't seem to be do anything with the influence...I am missing something big.


I was black, and was rated 12k on KGS.  My opponent was rated as 9k on KGS.
Thanks,
Casey

Hello, I'm Wawl, around 2k on KGS, I will try to tell you as much true thing as I can, but please be aware that I won't always be right =)]

(;B[pg]C[I think that this was a mistake.  With two white stones in the upper left, I should have used a pincer, to avoid white taking the entire top....But I am not sure...Would the pincer have been effective with white so strong on top?

[comment\]
About the pincer : I think you were right not to play the pincer because white f17 makes it difficult to make a good base. I included a standart joseki variation, 

Otherwise, Q13 is not a very efficient move, because it leaves the corner wide open at the san-san (r17)]

(;B[dm]C[[comment\] same as q13, you want to play d6, but this time, it will be to be stronger and play h3]

(;B[kq]C[I thought that this move was sente, and  should have been played before responding to WQ9.
I thought it increased my territory and threatened white...
Maybe L2 would have been better.
Maybe this move was not good at all because it was too small...I don't know.

[comment\]
This move looks aji-keshi to me, you will no longer be able to play h3 as white -will- answer at k3. L2 is the same idea, but on the second line, which is horrible under those circumstances. Keep  the second line for the end of the game.]

C[My thought with this was that I could fight to the center, or slip underneath white to my lower right corner.
Here starts the biggest question of my game.

I have seen reference to  influence, and  that influence in the early game is much more important than territory,
(Even a few linked stones pointed towards the center seem to be commented on games and articles as being
much more important than territory...)

I guess I just don't understand something.

The sequence from here builds a large wall of black pointed towards the center.
I further thought that they were strong stones, because they were linked to stones on the left side that had a base.

It seems to me that I should have been able to profit from it more, and I don't know when to do so, or really how.

[comment\]
Alright, let's start with a proverb :

- Corner is gold, Edge is silver, center is grass

This provers means that it is much easier to get territory in the corner than in center. There will usually be very few points in the center compared to sides and corners. Thus, influence is not usually used to gain territory, but rather to attack or invade. When one is strong in the center, he can easily invade anything, because as soon as he reaches it, he'll be safe. On the other hand, if the other player is strong in center and you try to invade his side, then you will suffer a very long attack during which he will will gain points and you will gain 2 points (eyes). 

concerning this h2 move, I'm not sure whether it is good or not. I looks like it should start a fight and that it's not necessary.]

I would like to better know how to utilize my long string of black in the lower right...

[comment\]

hmm, I wouldn't play h16, because it doesn't seem to do much, what I would like at black is to attack r6 and q9. As for your influence, you can leave it as is, there is no move that increases it enough for now, wait for a good opportunity for it =)]

(;B[hf];W[be];B[bf];W[rj];B[ri];W[qj];B[ne]C[Probably a useless move.  I was trying to gather to try and invade white near M18.  Maybe I should have spent more time with the center...Or with the corner at A4.

o15 forestalls m17, so I don't like it ^^. g17 is enormous, and you should still be able to play some forcing moves on r6 (like s6 or something) (a4 is small)]

So, What I think is that you played well until a certain point, where you started to "panick" a little. you should be able to progress a lot if you learn some little techniques, like no touching strong stones that you want to stop (would you stop a river with your hand or build a barrage ?) and don't worry too much about influence. Just think about influence as something that can be used to threaten a biiiig territory or attack other stones. 

Try attacking a little more too, you let white go away with too much =)
